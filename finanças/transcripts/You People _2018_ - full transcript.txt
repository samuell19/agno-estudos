(intense music) Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. (loud commotion) - Okay, everyone take out a piece of paper. Don't panic, it's not a pop quiz. Now, I need you to write down the top three things that you must identify with. It can be anything. No wrong answers. Time! Pencils down. Young lady. - Grad student. - [Teacher] Go on. - Sister. And someday, hopefully governor of this great state. - Mm, ambition. I admire that. - An American citizen. - American citizen. - Rebel. (laughing) - [Teacher] Okay. - Black. I'm a black female. - [Teacher] Black, a black female. What's the first thing on your mind? (dramatic music) - [Reporter] Breaking news right now at 10, one person is dead after a shooting on Oklahoma City's northeast side. * I met a man walking home the other day * * The brother told me * Wish I could do it all over again * * Cause now I see * Don't love you back * Don't love you back * Try to stay focused on tomorrow * * Play within my means * Paying portions on borrow * So I gave my whole life to it * * Could've put a knife through it * * Should've been the life moving * - [Teacher] I need you to list... * I mean, nobody ever told me * Learned on my own because nobody ever showed me * * At home, they talking bout I made it now * * I feel boxed in hoping that I make it out * * I'm not from Harlem, I'm not from Compton * * I'm from Oklahoma City, rotten * * Trying to get it poppin' * Trying to please everybody * I never do enough, yo, I'm never good enough * - [Reporters] A struggled continued, and five shots are fired. (gun firing) (clearing throat) (snoring) - We might have to get out the bucket of hot water. - And why aren't you dressed, Professor? Like father like son. - Well, at least I have good taste in music. - [Mom] Looks like the 90s projective vomited all over this room. - Oh! And what is your definition of quality music, Mrs. Johnson? - Well you know, like Adele. - Ugh. Well, at least you're pretty. - What's wrong with Adele? - Nothing. - [Mom] What kind of blissful noise have you exposed him to, huh? - I have exposed him to greatness. (chuckling) Led Zeppelin. - Hm. - The Rolling Stones. Bob Dylan. Jimi Hendrix. (chuckling) (singing) (laughing) - Sweet Jesus, I'm up! - Oh, look who's decided to greet the day in all his awkward glory. - Dad. Where are your pants? - In my room. - Do you want to go find them and never take them off again? And can you two please get this baby making gyrating out of my room? - Hm! - Oh, come here. - Not a chance! Dad, pants, pants! (catchy music) * Time to time * I know you must see * Scary shadows * Of what we could be * Well, I wish you weren't so frightened now * * Of me (drowned out music) * Well, hey * I just want to love you right * - Oh my God. Best Snap ever. Fuckin' epic! That had to be the whitest shit I've ever seen, son! Come here. Hey, you must be careful, I'm gonna have to revoke your black card. - Jesus freak, man! - Hey! Rude. I showered. - I'm talking about your whisky breath. - So I made a breakfast cocktail, big deal, people do that. - Yeah, alcoholics. (humming) - Oh! Whoa, nice trousers, Dr. Johnson. - Sarcasm, in the morning. A degenerate after my own heart. - Hey! - Nice hair, Michael. Very hipster. - Yeah, yeah. - I'm doing that new dance. You know, the Twitter. Like Miley Cyrus. - Uh, I believe the dance you're referring to is twerking. That... That is not twerking. Oh my God, stop being weird. - Hey, I'm shaking off the haters. - Chad, your parents are blacker than you. (laughing) * Confirmation, the conversation I'm debating * * Contemplating, I've forsaken, waiting patient * - Thanks for the ride, bro. I should be getting my license back soon. Hey, crank this shit up. * Now the power in the fist - Yeah! * So raise it in the midst * If it's Shaka or a Kunta - Nope, I'm sorry. I can't, I can't. It's way too early to turn up. - It is my duty as your friend to give you an urban education. (laughing) - Oh, do enlighten me, master. - Hey, I can teach a thing or two about how hard it is for us black folks out here in the projects. - Nope. One, this is white suburbia, and two, you're not black. - I am the motherfuckin' Mr. Miyagi of blackness, son! Watch and learn. See, you are an enigma. (catchy music) - Whoa! Why don't you watch where you're fucking going, faggot. - I'm sorry. - Well, you're sorry, but you almost ran over me and my girlfriend. - I'm sorry. - Yeah, I know. She deserves an apology though. - Holy balls. Would you look at that? - [Chad] Damn, mama. - Chad, I would totally leave you for her. Where the hell has she been hiding all semester? - She's probably been preoccupied with that vampire lookin', steroid induced douche bag she's clinging to like a spider monkey. - Psh, stop being salty, I'm worshiping him right now. - Dude, he's dating Kylie Jenner, and he's terrorizing that kid over there. Douche. - What are you, Supernigga? You're always penning the outcast. You got this savior complex in you. Chad, she's looking at us. - I'm not blind, bro, what do we do? - I don't know. Act natural, wave. Put your fuckin' hand down, she's not waving at us. Have some class, you perv. - No, just come on, let me get my glasses. - Ah, ah, ah. - Just let me get my glasses. - No, no, no, no, no. Allow me. Bye. - Whatever. (laughing) - I gotta get to women's studies. - Now that's a class you're willing to be on time for. - There's literally no better place to pick up chicks, bro. Later. (phone ringing) - Yes? - [Woman] There's a representative from an adoption agency on the line? They said it was urgent. (somber piano music) (clapping) - My name is Melanie Fischer, and I cannot adequately express how proud and thrilled I am to see all you beautiful, colorful people on this very special day. This is an extremely incredible opportunity for us all to share collective experiences together, and to connect with a diverse group of individuals who might never... Oh, hi. Hi, yes. Take a seat, thank you. As I was saying, this is a great opportunity for us to build a tolerance for anyone who has ever felt different or unloved, afraid, or simply unacknowledged. This club is your safe haven. It is a place of peace, and I look forward to getting to know all of you and hearing all of your stories. Thank you. (clapping) - And I'm pretty sure that's what caused it. - I could do without the judgment right now. - Just saying, you're not making it any easier on yourself. - Look, I just want to have some hangover food with my best friend in peace, please. Okay? - All right. - Oh. - Hello, fellas. Here you go. - Thanks, Leah. - It's Le-ah. - Forgive me, my mistake. - Yeah, the dash is there for a reason. - That poor girl! - About to make this waffle my bitch! Look at that. I know you're jealous. - So jealous. - Well, if it ain't the gruesome twosome. Hey, Brad. - Chad. (chuckles) - Sure. Well enjoy it, Brad. - New friend of yours? - Just business, Chad. We can't all be privileged. God, this guy is always with a different chick. - [Chad] Must be his flavor of the week. - Bet he's got a bigger dick than you. * Trying to paint a picture so vivid * * I live it, give it the image * Mandela sitting in prison * No different mission of business * * Reminiscing, what is this * Militant Chuck D, Public Enemy * - So, what are you selling exactly? - Peace. (laughing) - That's certainly not for sale. It's a state of mind. - You should join us. - What are you guys protesting? - Have you turned on the news lately? - God, no. There's never anything worth watching on there. - Okay, well, some of us actually care about things that matter. You know, this affects you too whether you want to admit it or not. - Damn. Girl, chill. - I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be mean or anything-- - You're fine. Just giving you a hard time. (drowned out rap music) (chuckling) (somber piano music) (soda fountain running) A stalker much? What are you protesting now, vegetables? - Oh, dressing on the side, cute. What are you, a vegan? - No, I just like to be health conscious. - You looked right at me when you said that. - Nah uh. - Okay, well, you know what? I'm just gonna eat this delicious, fatty goodness while you starve all day because you decided to eat grass for lunch. - What brings you to this university? Other than being a psych major. - Well, it's a means of an end, I guess. I mean, I've changed majors as much as I've changed t-shirts. I don't know, it's difficult settling on one thing. You know, one major that will ultimately become the rest of your life. So finally, I settled on psychology with a minor in contemporary dance. - You plan on dancing for your patience once you start counseling? (laughing) Really? - Yeah. - A fry. - Yeah. - Okay. - Yeah. - Okay, real mature. (laughing) - Here, just eat one. - No, just look at it-- - Just one. - It's greasy, it's salty. - It's gonna be okay-- - It's not good for you. - Okay. - It's not good for you. - Okay. No, you're right, I'll take it. More for me. - Yeah, you can have it. (chuckling) - Okay, well, let's test it, let's play counselor. I'm gonna ask you some questions. What is your favorite movie? - Now, that's a deep, methodical question. You go straight for the jugular, don't you? Okay, I'm gonna have to say "American Pie". - Oh, God! You're one of those guys. - Are you not gonna tell me yours isn't "The Notebook"? - [Melanie] "Requiem For a Dream". - [Chad] What? - Oh, I don't think I can be friends with someone who doesn't get a stiffy for Aronofsky. But I'm gonna give you a chance to redeem yourself. - Mm. - Tell me something personal. - You first, I'm blocked. - Okay. Things I hate. Black licorice, because it is not a candy. Seriously, it tastes like tar, and it is one of the worst things in the world. What else... Reality TV, Kanye West, and all disciples of Fox News. Boom! (laughs) - Okay. Fears. Small people, clowns, Ferris wheels. Can't trust 'em. - That's predictable. - I thought the counselor was supposed to be unbiased. You suck at this. - Uh... (laughing) - What, you aren't afraid of anything? - Nothing comes to mind. - Rejection. That's a big one. - Um... You know, Chad, I feel like I need to tell you something, and this is not to be presumptuous or anything, it's more preventative. But I like you, and I think you're funny, and sincere, and this has been really, really nice, but I just got out of a toxic relationship and I don't think I'm really ready to jump into-- - I spoke too soon. - Friends? - Friends. Nice chatting with you, Counselor. - How can I help you, Jasmine? Can I call you Jasmine? - Mrs. Johnson. - Barbara. You can call me Barbara. - Barbara. I want you to know I really appreciate your meeting with me. - You've come a long way. - Not long enough. - You look a lot different than I remember. - 21 years of hard living. - So, why have you come to my office after all these years? - There's no sense in us dancing around hot coals. I think we both know why I'm here. - It was an open adoption. - I don't mean no disrespect, ma'am. I know I ain't got no legal right to his name. I must look pretty pathetic sitting in front of you. It's... Time. The answer is time. - Our beautiful boy. Chad. Chad Eugene Johnson. - I still have dreams of him. Dreams of where he is, what he looks like, what his goals are. How he's treated by other people. Does he ever wonder? - Briefly. In junior high he had some questions. It's not a subject that he's very forthcoming about. - I was never-- - Just tell me why. Just answer me. - I was never prepared to be a mother. I was young and selfish. My parents could barely afford to put a roof over my head. Chad would've been just another casualty of my shame. If I had known how much suffering and regret I'd have to endure by letting him go, I'd of done the best I could under the circumstances. I'm asking you for a chance to do the right thing, again. (somber piano music) While there's still time. (somber piano music) (drowned out pop music) (clears throat) - Are you okay, miss? - Oh, yeah, thanks. I'll be fine. - Maybe she's just a friend. - I may be pretty, but I'm not stupid. Oh, I'm sorry. Do I know you? - No. No, we attend the same college. - Oh, I'm Amber. - Chad. - Thanks again for asking if I'm okay, I appreciate it. - You know what makes me feel better on a rough day? - Hm? - A new pair of shoes. - Ooh! - Try 'em on. - Thank you. (chuckles) - Need a hand? - No, I think I'm good, thanks. - God, you lesbians are so independent. (laughing) - I am not a lesbian! - Oh, awkward, I'm sorry. I just thought since you were like, a part of the club-- - You thought that since I was the president of the Queer Club that I was a grade A certified lesbian. - Well, I just want you to know that I'm really inspired by everything you're doing for this university. Lesbian or not. (laughing) - No, well, I think it's you guys who are really changing lives. Oh my God, you're about as subtle as a grenade. I saw you checking that guy out. - Man, if I could get my hands on a piece of that I'd have his babies. I mean, we may not be able to reproduce, but we could keep practicing anyway. - Okay, so, go talk to him! I mean, he's cute, you're cute, what's the problem? - Yeah, I wish it were that simple. But what about you? This club isn't exactly ideal for hetero hookups. - There's this guy. - Tell me, tell me. - I don't know. My ex pretty much ruined any prospect of romance for me. - But are you really gonna let every future male suitor pay for the sins of one asshole? - I don't... (laughs) - You are so busted. - Hi. You know, you really should learn to clear the search history on your laptop before logging out. (laughing) The look on your face. I was just dropping off some laundry. All right. So, what do you want on this aisle? - Nothing over here. - Oh, come on, it's because it's healthy. I'm gonna get you some juice. - I don't want juice! - It'll be good for you. It'll be good for your brain. - No! No! - All right, what else do you want then? - Some snackage. - You want some snackage. - Snackage. - Oh, hey, baby, I gotta take this. Why don't you go pick out your cereal and I'll finish up here. - Okay. - Hi! Jasmine. Could I call you right back? - Oh, I'm sorry, ma'am, I didn't see you there. - May I help you with something? - No, no, I'm fine. I'm just keeping my eye on that young man over there. - Well, that young man happens to be my son. And you know, I've tried my best as his mother to safeguard him from self righteous people such as yourself who can't seem to get past their own pigheaded ignorance! That young man over there is the kindest, most compassionate, honest, generous people that you will ever know. If I had any less compassion, I would have you fired. Of course, then I would be acting the way you expect me to. Good day, ma'am. Don't you have some groceries to stock? - Clean up on aisle nine. Way to go, mom. - Nobody messes with my baby. - You know you want to. - No. - You know it's gonna happen. - No, no. - Yup. - Put it down, let's go. - Three, two, one... - No, no. - Hump day! Bro, I am starving. - We just devoured a Chinese buffet. - True, but I may or may not have lit up in the parking lot. So, I've got the munchies. - You're gonna get caught one of these days. - Let's just say the dean and I have an understanding. - Understanding? Like a sexual understanding? - Shh, keep your voice down, Chad, this is a library. Have some class son, sheesh. - Class? - Just go, go! Better quiet down, miss. I'm watching you. (laughing) Ah, I see that books aren't the only thang we're here to check out. - Her name is Melanie. - Ah! So you admit it. Thank God, celibacy was making you difficult to be around. - She's not interested, Mike. She said as much herself, I mean look at her. She's into black guys. (chuckling) You know what I mean. - I don't think you know what you mean. (keys jingling) Go, go. - Give me my keys, man. - Go. - You know, I'm not entirely convinced that you read as often as you're trying to lead on. - Really? - Well, I mean, you didn't come here for the terrible coffee either. - No, I actually came over to ask if you... I mean, to see if you wanted to, or if you're available, or interested. I mean, maybe we could... I mean, it wouldn't be... (laughing) Nevermind. - Chad. Ask me again. - Will you go out to dinner with me Saturday night? - Hell no. (laughing) (somber music) - We are his family. You think Chad doesn't know that? - I feel like he's gonna take one look at her and know what he's missed all these years. I'm gonna pale in comparison. (somber music) - You are living inside your head. You and I have raised a brilliant kid. It would be selfish not to share his greatness with other people. This will always be his home. He knows that. - God! I love this man. (somber music) - Prepare to be boarded. (laughing) - Oh dear. - I am coming for you. - [Barbara] Oh my! - You're gonna get some of this. - [Barbara] Oh, I like it! - And some of this. (laughing) - Oh God! - [Father] You'll be hoisted up on this-- - Hoisted? Oh dear, oh no. Oh my God. - And maybe a little of this! (laughing) You think they can hear us? - [Barbara] Not a chance! - All right. Prepare for liftoff. (laughing) - Sounds like your parents are getting on that business! - Turn up the volume, please. We need some white noise in the background. - I'm pretty sure that qualifies as a white noise. So... Netflix, porn, no chill though. Fuck that, right? - Neither. Wait, you still watch porn? - Uh, am I a male? Do I have a penis? - How do you find time between that and your other hobbies? - We make time, Chad. I try to rub one out on my lunch breaks. - I can't imagine why you never told me that story. Does he have a name? - It changes like the seasons. I try to give it a pretentious name like a Sebastian or a Cornelius. (laughing) - I call mine the Dark Knight... Rises. - Holy shit, son. That is the fuckin' shit! No toilet! - Stop, stop it! - So... When are you gonna make a freak out of library girl? - When are you gonna realize you and I aren't the same person? - Well, if it wasn't for me, there would be no date to speak of, so you're welcome. - There is one thing you can help me with. Melanie, she's into black men. And when I say black men, I mean black men. - Black men. - And I listen to indie rock, I shop at Banana Republic, and I use colorful words like flabbergasted in everyday conversation. I'm fully aware of my ethnic limitations? I need an urban transformation, so I have a proposition for you. Now, I was... - I thought you'd never ask. (drowned out rap music) * Before I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined * * Before I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined * * Before I had it, I closed my eyes and imagined * * Now I ain't never had much, see * * Each side dusty * Half a loaf of bread, red Kool-Aid * * And some lunch meat * Girls wouldn't touch me * Thinking I had it * Close my eyes and imagine * No matter how the situation looked * * Plates empty * Imagining food like the scene on Hook * * If my dreams don't hook, line, and sinker * * Everything I think of * I close my eyes to see * Everything come alive * And only these dreams keep me * * Perfect visions are in my mind * * And maybe you'll see one day * All that I've seen, you'll know * * You can believe, just clothes your eyes with me * * Imagination (doorbell rings) - Damn, girl. You clean up nicely. - Thanks. - Yo, that dress fits you like one of Beyonce's weaves. Flawless. - You look different. - Different good or different bad? - I haven't decided yet. * I got your confirmation * The conversation I'm debating * * Contemplating, I've forsaken, waiting patient * - Is this what you listen to? - Man, hell yeah! * Now that's the power in the fist * * So we raise it - I didn't know you smoked weed. - Yeah. Yeah, fo sho. - Well, what do you say we make this night a little more interesting? (laughing) - Wow, this is unexpected. - Oh, Chad. I want you to meet my favorite person, this is Devin. - Oh, what's up bro? - Right. I'm good, bro. Are you guys ready to order? - Just get Chad and I my regular, and I'm gonna visit the little girl's room. (laughing) (gurgling) - Psst. Sup, nigga. - Greetings, my niggers. Oh, no, no, no. Niggas. (chuckling) - [Melanie] You okay? What's wrong? - Don't look behind you, but there's this cowboy looking dude staring me down. (laughing) - Okay, so what? Just ignore him. Is there a problem, sir? Okay. (laughing) - That was straight gangsta! - Okay, I'm sorry, but can you please stop talking like that? - What's wrong with how I talk? - It's not you! Here. That is so much better. So you think being black is just a character you play? - It's not natural. I'm too white washed to be accepted by blacks, and I'm too black to be fully embraced by whites. I straddle the proverbial line that separates the two. - Well, maybe you just have a limited perspective of what it means to be black or white. I mean, you're black because you were born black. It doesn't come with an instructional manual, just be yourself. - You're gonna make a great counselor some day. - [Devin] Stoner special coming in. This one is on the house. - Oh God, is it that obvious? - Your eyes are dilated, you smell like a frat house, and the two of you have been laughing as if you're at a standup comedy show. And I for one know that this one is not that funny. (laughing) - Stop! (laughing) Thank you. - You're funny. - Thanks. I'm gonna eat though, so... - Okay. (doorbell rings) - I'll get it. It's good to see you again. Can I get you something to drink? - No, I'm fine. Thank you. (somber piano music) - Jasmine. - Barbara. - Look. (chuckling) Oh, and here he is as a cowboy. And swimming. (door creaks) - Hey mom, dad. - Chad, honey, can you come in here for just a minute? This is Jasmine Jones, and she's traveled all the way from Tulsa just to see you. - To see you? - Yeah baby, just to see you. Chad, Jasmine is your birth mother. (emotional music) Why don't we take a drive around the lake? (door creaks) - [Jasmine] What's on your mind? - I'm not sure exactly. It's a lot to process. My parents, they kept a significant detail of this arrangement under wraps. - [Jasmine] Are you very upset, Chad? - Well, why now? I gave up on this sort of thing a long time ago. - You sound just like her. - Well, she did raise me. - I want you to know that not a single day went by that I didn't think about you. But you've grown, thrived, become your own man. It pains and comforts me in equal measure that you've become someone special with no influence of my own. (chuckling) The same blood runs through our veins yet I can see your eyes look straight through me. I thank God that someone loved and protected you the way I should've, the way I couldn't. (sobbing) (coughing) - [Chad] Are you okay? - I'm not gone yet. I still have some time, if you're willing to share yours. - Where's the Jack, bitches! I need a shot. Let's turn up, motherfuckers! - Well, you heard her! Let's turn it up, bitches! - You didn't tell me Luke was hosting. - Hey, a party's a party, right? Come on Chad, lighten up. Live a little. Besides, there's a sea of other drunk college students to distract yourself with. - Don't step... - Chad! I thought that was you. How's my favorite sales clerk doing? Are you leaving? - No. Nah, I just came out to get some fresh air. - Mm. Let me guess. This isn't really your scene, is it? - I do better with smaller crowds. (laughing) - Are you with Luke? - Yes. - Hm. - I know what you're thinking. - No, no, no, it's none of my business. - Hear me out. He's rough around the edges, I know. But he's actually really sensitive and caring when you get to know him. He's been through a lot. Just last year his mom confessed that she had an affair and that he's not his father's biological son. He and his father were very close. It's really changed him. Sometimes I think I'm the only support system that he has. - Well... I hope he pays as much attention to you as you do to him. It's not your responsibility to save him. Just make sure you're taking care of yourself. - Really, Luke? - Babe, we are just talking. - Wow. (laughs) - Amber. Amber. - There he is! Hey! Hey, don't you give me that look. - Just take it easy, Mike, it's not a race-- - Hey, hey, hey, I don't need no babysitter, you're not my brother. Hey, hey, hey, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it, aight? Look, I'll cut you a deal. I'll switch to beer, but you gotta promise me you'll at least attempt to socialize with these people. - And these are all your friends, Mike. - No, no, that's not true, they just don't know how dope you are yet, man. Dude, come here. (dramatic music) Aight. Aight everybody, listen up. Listen up! I've got an announcement to make. For those of you who don't know, this is my best friend Chad. Everybody say "Hi, Chad!" - [Group] Hi, Chad! - Thank you. You see, Chad here, is the best damn version of me. He's a real, live rockstar and a fucking amazing companion. You see, Chad, he's a little shy. It takes him a little while to open up to others. So if you God damn party monsters would be so kind as to make him feel welcome, I promise he'll be the best investment you ever made! Now get up off your asses and get this motherfucker a real drink! (cheering) - Sorry. * Drinks is on me * Get loose, Grey Goose * That Patron got me in the zone * * Get loose, Grey Goose * Got me in the zone * Got, got me in the zone * She's a bad chick, I gotta have it * * Matter of fact she run with a bunch of chicks * * I woke up and say do you want a drink * * She leans over, and drinks is on me * * She got good head * And I like that * She got soft skin * And I like that * She got a nice whip * And I like that * She's independent and I really like that * (record scratching) * Drinks is on me * And I like that * And I like that * And I like that * Really like that * Drinks is on me (cheering) - I thought black people are only good at contact sports. - I'm not really black, it's just a really good tan. - Yeah. Must be nice being someone else's charity case. - I'm not sure I follow. - Oh, well, Michael, he told me that you were adopted. And it's become a social trend for the distinguished to adopt minority children. - Is there a point to this sermon? - Yes. I would like you to teach me about yourself. All this new age, progressive... "Progressive". Liberal shenanigans. Black people carrying on like white people and vice versa. I'm sure you share my philosophy. - And what philosophy is that? - The belief, distinction, that there's a difference between black people and niggers! Nothing. (laughs) Wow, nothing, no reaction. You know, I half expected you to call in your boy Michael to come in, jump me, and beat my ass. But that just wouldn't add up, would it? I see why Melanie likes you. Well, if you lie with dogs... Oh, you didn't know. (ominous music) - You know what, Luke? You don't know anything about me. But at least now we all know who you are. And at least I know who my family is. (dramatic music) (laughing) - Let's play, let's play, let's play. Let's fuckin' play! (dramatic music) - Mm. - Just beer, huh? Hey. You made it, I thought you two flaked. Where is she? - Outside. - Look, I'm sorry man. I didn't know this was Luke's house, and I didn't know Luke and Melanie dated, I would've never-- - Don't sweat it, boo. - This is my obnoxious best friend Michael, he is very drunk right now. - Yeah, I hadn't noticed. Pleasure, Michael. - Hey, man. Any friend of Chad's is a friend of mine. Let's get this man a drink! - All right. (drowned out music) - What are you doing later? Let's get the fuck out of here. - Well, that escalated quickly. - I can't believe I let you convince me to go to that party. - Man, I saved you back there, you should be thanking me. - You gotta be kidding me. Michael, look, just sit back and be quiet. All right? - [Michael] Okay. - Okay. Both hands on the wheel, make eye contact, be respectful. Breathe. (knocking) - Well, what do you know. Where are you boys headed at this hour? - Headed home, sir. - Your momma teach you to talk proper like that? - Yes. Yes sir, she did. - Now she sounds like a pretty smart woman. You ever been arrested, son? - No, sir. No, I haven't. - We'll see about that. License and registration, hand it over. You look nervous, boy. You boys have been drinking? - Just a few beers. Right, Chad? - No, sir, I haven't been drinking. - You boys sit tight. - Sit tight. - Are you fucking kidding me? - It was joke man, chill. Okay? - Sit back. Sit back, Mike! - [Michael] Chad, I'm sorry, I-- - Shut up, shut up, shut up! - Breathe into this, son. - No. - [Officer] What did you just say to me? - I said no. I'm not breathing into that. Did you find anything on my record? No sir, you didn't. You're trying to bait me into an altercation. Now, it's been a very long night, I haven't done anything wrong, and I'd appreciate it if you let me and my friend go home. - Step out of the car, son. - For what? I-- - Officer, Officer, it was just a bad joke. He hasn't been drinking, I have. He's my designated driver. - I said step out of the car. Arms to your side, eyes closed. Put your left index finger on your nose. - Are you serious? - Get back in the car, Michael. - What's your fucking problem, man! - Get back in the fucking car, Mike! - Do you let the white man fight all your battles for you? - That's my fucking friend you're harassing! You don't know what he means to me, what he's done for me. He's a good man! - Mike, look at me. Go sit down, all right? I'm sorry. You said this line? Hm? - Get back in your vehicle. (dramatic music) - Fuck. (sobbing) You really did it this time, Mike. You almost got me arrested, man. You gotta stop this! - I know. I know. (sobbing) (dramatic music) * So we cherished, embarrassed with holy merit * * I only fight to the point * To where I can bear it * My soul is barren, these dreams is trying to scare it * * Scar it, I beg your pardon * I'm starting, it parched the harshest * * I tried so hard * To live my life * With these kind of people around me * * It's a hard time - So, are you gonna go? Come on bro, you have to. - No, actually, I don't. - You're not the least bit curious? - Maybe 10 years ago, but I have a family now. - Yeah, but it's not like they're trying to take that away from you, they just want to be a part of your life. I wouldn't let them down easy either, but at least give them a chance. I mean, don't you want to know where you came from? You gotta blame someone for why you're so damn ugly, right? Look, I'll cut you a deal. I'll quit drinking if you go to this reunion. - Nah uh, nope. Doesn't work that way, Mike. You have to quit drinking because you want to. - True, you're right. Just promise me you'll at least consider going. Don't let your pride hinder you from a potentially great thing. And don't go to appease them. Go so you can get closure. - Let me guess, the usual? - Yeah, I'll take a Bud Light. - I'll go to the reunion, Mike. - Actually, water will be fine. - How is she? - I gave an oath of secrecy. I'm afraid the only information I can divulge is the contents of the Spanish omelet. Do I look like a stripper to you? - Devin. There's nothing I can do? (laughing) - What's so funny? - I'm sorry, I just had an idea. But it's gonna require your full commitment. - Try me. - I'll explain, I get off in an hour. I know the perfect place we can go to unwind. - Oh, easy Polanski, we just met here. - Hm. - Devin? - Melanball. - Yes queens, take your pick. Caramel or white chocolate? (laughing) - Oh, you already know, I like the dark meat. - In that case, snowflake is all mine. - What the actual fuck? - Hey, I just told them you were a little shorthanded for the fundraiser this weekend, and they graciously offered to volunteer. - Okay, ladies, gents and everyone in between, you are in for a sickening gender bending extravaganza for a very special cause. The name of the game is... Beat Dat Face! I will be selecting two queens from the audience to give makeovers to two straight people from the audience, and then the audience will pick a winner. So, do I have any volunteers? (laughing) - Yes! - [Host] Yes, yes, the two thirsty queens in the back. And how about my straight people? Come on, don't be shy! Mhm. You two. Come on up and have a seat on stage. All right, ladies. Beat Them Faces! (catchy pop music) * To say you still hate me * You're simply understating * It makes me feel so crazy * To say you're uncertain (cheering) (clapping) (laughing) - I'm not sure I'll ever be able to look at you the same. - Yeah. Look, I just wanted to say that I'm really... (lighthearted piano music) (chuckling) - Wow, ain't you just a delicious hunk of sexy chocolate? You'd melt nicely in my mouth. - Okay, sorry, sorry, sorry, but this one's mine. - Damn, girl! You can't be bringing in eye candy like this and not share him with the rest of us thirsty bitches. You better hold onto his manhood like a vice grip, honey. - Okay, all right, come on. - Girl. (catchy music) - You neglected to mention this was a gay bar. - What difference does it make? You're with me, right? Come on, come on. Let's dance! Come on! (chuckling) Hey, hey, look at me! Look at me. Don't be scared, okay? If there's anywhere in this planet that you didn't have to worry about how other people look at you, it's here, okay? Get out of your head! Come on, just let go! Just... Okay, move your hips. Just go with it! - [Chad] You're just gonna leave me here? (catchy electronic music) - You look lost. - And you look like you just lost a bet predicting who'd win The Voice. And there's no consolation at the bottom of that vodka you're sucking down. And shouldn't you be out here mining this treasure trove for attractive gay men? - Gays aren't inherently extroverted, Chad. I keep to myself. Although I did notice a little cutie over there. The hottie in the purple pants with the face like Jesus. - I don't know. If I would've seen him anywhere else but here I'd think he's straight. There's something about his demeanor doesn't scream "I love Project Runway and listening to show tunes". - You must think I just sashay around in my underwear listening to Lady Gaga and Beyonce. - Well, don't you? - Obviously! But that's beside the point. There's more to me than that. There's no way in hell that that guy is straight. - How can you be so sure? - The five second rule. Straight men don't give other guys eye contact for very long. Two or three seconds tops. And when a gay man suspects that another man is part of the family, he looks into his eyes for five whole seconds without blinking. And if he reciprocates, you know he's checking you out. It's like an unspoken gay language or something. - So, did he reciprocate? I mean, you seem pretty confident. - Trust me, he's not interested. - We'll see about that. Rejected again. And we all have somebody we'd sacrifice our right arm for just to spend one night with them. We convince ourselves that if they just gave us just five seconds of their time, we can prove to them we're the right person for them, and for obvious reasons, they don't give us the time of day. Like karma, it is a vicious cycle. See that cutie sitting in the middle table over there? I saw him from across the room and I finally mustered up the courage to go say hi, and he blew me off! Not in the fun way. (chuckling) Want to know his excuse? He said he was holding out for the hottie in the tight, purple skinny jeans. Looks like the pendulum of fate has just swung back in your favor, my friend. - Hi, I'm Devin. Can I buy you a drink? (catchy r&b music) * Sexy, independent * Sexy, independent * You are a star * Sexy, independent * Sexy, independent * Sexy, independent * Sexy, independent * Sexy, independent - [Woman] Oh my God. Did you hear that? I think there's someone in our house! - [Woman] I didn't hear anything. - Okay, okay. You've taken several self defense courses, Felicia. You're a one woman killing machine! You've got this. Sir! We have a knife. - We do? - Yes, we do. And we're not afraid to use it. So you better just stand right there. - There's been a big misunderstanding here. Okay? I'm here with-- - Really, really? You've broken into our house, removed your trousers. If your intention was to physically assault one of us, you've come to the wrong place, my friend. I've got a snapper trapper that will sever your manhood in half. - It's true. - Don't you move a muscle. Hey! (dramatic music) (groaning) - [Chad] Please! I'm not a bad guy. - Mom? - Melanie? (gasping) - Oh my God. - Not bad. - Mom! - [Felicia] For a guy, I mean. - Well, sweetheart. I can't tell you how good it is to see you and how happy we are. - I thought you guys were on vacation. - We're sorry to have interrupted your little sexcapade. This is our house, you know. - Enough! Okay? I can't take it anymore. This is Chad, and you guys will be happy to know he's not a psycho sex killer. He's in fact a reluctant participant in this date from hell. Chad, say hello to my mother, Felicia. And my other mother, Margaret. - Makes so much sense now. - Aw, he's adorable. He just put two and two together. - Margaret, come with me to the kitchen. We have a distinguished guest in much need of a mimosa. - [Felicia] Aren't you happy to see us, sweetie? I guess it was fate that told us to come back early from Tulsa. - I might be traveling there in a few weeks. - Suit yourselves. Salud. - [Margaret] Well, what's the occasion? - My birth mother is hosting a family reunion so I can meet my biological family. - I just love stories like this. Makes me tear up just thinking about it. When I first laid my eyes on Melanie, I knew my life would never be the same. - Our lives would never be the same. - Our lives. - Well, Chad, it is a pleasure to meet you. I apologize for the near bludgeoning. - Melanie, you really should bring him over for a proper dinner some time. Preferably with his clothes on. (chuckling) - Okay. (chuckling) - [Reporter] Here's Tom with more. - Hey Dad, guess what I got accepted into? - Quiet! I'm trying to hear this. - It's a fraternity. - I'll tell you one thing. I better not catch you at one of these damn demonstrations. - [Luke] Yes, sir. - Not under my roof. I raised you to respect authority. - [Luke] Dad. - What are you looking at? - Dad. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - [Luke] Just give me a minute. (groaning) - Say something! Do something! Be a man! Yeah. (laughing) That's what I thought. Now fix your face. You're starting to look like her. (heavy breathing) (dramatic music) (door shuts) - Well good morning, Michael. - Good morning, Mrs. Johnson. Is Chad awake? - Oh, I'm afraid he's not home right now. - Oh, I just assumed 'cause his car was parked outside. - He spent the night with Melanie last night. Are you okay? You look a little frazzled, you want to come inside? - Oh, no, no, no, that's fine. Can you just have him give me a call when he's home? - Sure. Are you sure you're okay? - Actually, do you mind if I use your restroom? - Well of course, silly. Come on in. - Thanks. - You've left me with no other option, Luke. We've been here before, but I'm not coming back this time. - I need another chance. 'Cause you're the only one. You're the only one who cares about me. - I will always care. But I deserve better. I have to take care of myself now. - Amber. Amber. Amber. - Goodbye, Luke. (somber music) (chuckling) Something funny, Mike? - Yeah, actually. The pathetic look on your face after being rejected by someone you've treated like an option rather than a loyal friend. It's actually quite amusing. - What the fuck would you know, you drunk bastard. Do you know anything about suffering? Huh? - I know enough. You're no victim. You're just a sad little bully with daddy issues who's finally being called out for it. Take care, buddy. - Hey! He didn't pay his tab. - Man, fuck him. (engine revs) (laughing) (beeping) - Hey, guys. Where's my car? - Chad, come and have a seat. - Dad, what's wrong? Mom, you okay? - There was an accident. It's about Michael. - Is he okay? - No. He's gone, Chad. He borrowed your car. The last place anybody saw him was the pub, and there was a crash. (sobbing) (somber music) - [Michael] Yo, yo, this is Mike. You know what to do. Bye Felicia, peace! (sobbing) - It's okay. (sobbing) - Hey, where are you going with that bottle? - No, no. Are you proud of what you've made me? Because I fucking hate me. (dramatic music) - You don't have to do this. Not if you don't want to. People will understand if you need more time. You're not obligated. - I want to do this. I need to do this. It's what Michael would've wanted. (lighthearted guitar music) - [Jasmine] You ready for this? - You know, I was, until just now. - You have nothing to worry about. Everyone is beyond ecstatic to meet you. Especially... (clapping) Your Aunt Ruth. - He's here! Thank you Jesus. Come on over here boy, give your Auntie Ruth some sugar! - Jesus, Ruth! He's been through enough already today. - Okay, you're right. Woo, you're so good looking, just handsome. I guess that's one of the few things that you inherited from your no good daddy. (chuckling) Come on over here. We're so excited, I'm just happy you're here. He's here! He's here! - Everyone, Chad. We would like to officially welcome and introduce you to the Jones family. - It's wonderful he's here. - It's been a long time coming, but you're finally here. Beautiful. Isn't it? - It's incredible. I've never seen anything like it. - This is your grandfather. That's his artwork, he was an artist. And this is your grandmother. She was a musician. You see that old record player over there? She used to put us to sleep playing records on that thing. Music means a great deal to us. It has the power to heal. - So, Chad, sweetheart. I bet you've never had a good homecooked meal like this before. We have friend chicken, mashed potatoes, some sweet corn, macaroni and cheese, some biscuits, peppers, and you know we gotta have that hot sauce. - My best friend Michael made a version of this meal earlier this year. He was giving me a taste of my own culture. - Oh, eat up then. 'Cause we're gonna fatten you up nice and good before you go back. How else do you think the sisters, we get this thickness and get our big hips from? - Ruth, have a little class. - I'm just trying to make sure that my nephew gets fed well before he goes back over there with Edith and Archie Bunker. - Ruth. - [Ruth] Eating TV dinners. - Ruth. - Oh, don't get all worked up, Jasmine. I'm just trying to gauge how effectively my sweet nephew was raised. So, Chad. Have your parents ever taken you to a black church? Or have you gone to anything like one of the MLK parades or done something for Black History Month? - Damn it, Ruth! - I always feared this would happen. That they would try to shame him out of his heritage. I bet they took immense pride in raising this little young, black child. They probably stood him up on their ottomans and lifted him up in the air like he was Simba or something? - What the hell difference does it make? He's here! And that's all that matters to me. And you got a lot of nerve to talk! We don't know if you got a job or not! You got the nerve to be talking about everybody here like you're somebody special! You say more discourteous comment and I will come across this table, and I'll snatch out every dread you got locked up in your head. Excuse me. - Chad. I was out of line, and I'm sorry. But I am just so glad that you're here. - Hey, Aunt Ruth. Do you like music? - I do. (somber music) (lighthearted music) - [Jasmine] You have everything you need? - Yeah. Is that you? - Yep. And that's you. That's your father, Jonathan. Handsome, like you. - Why have you held onto this? - Believe me. I have many regrets. But meeting your father is not one of them. The past can sting, erode at your soul, shake you to the core. Without it, we can't grow. Your father was a hard lesson for me, but you... You were a blessing. - Is that why you brought me here? Teach me a lesson? - I brought you here because where you come from matters. You come from a strong heritage. We have withstood unspeakable pain and loss. But like a phoenix, we rise, reborn. Goodnight, son. - Goodnight, mom. * I got some confirmation * Through conversation I'm debating * * Contemplating, I've forsaken waiting patient * * I'm debating, making statements * * Hoods sacred, hoods awaken * Breathtaking, breaking molds that we got * * Guess we not, guess we is * Guess we're living in the midst of it * * Image it to pillage us * Pillaging off the diligence * Now that's the power in the fist * * So we raise it in the midst * If it's Shaka or a Kunta * Enslave 'em or abuse 'em * Is it culture or the music - Before we begin this ceremony, I would like you to give a warm welcome to one of my very own pupils with a special message. Please, put your hands together for Mr. Chad Johnson. (clapping) - And this moment is so much bigger than myself. Four years ago when I first stepped foot on this campus as a jovial, naive, carefree freshman, I wouldn't of imagined the hard lessons I would have to learn, so. Here goes nothing. Graduations are a lot like funerals. All your loved ones gather to witness a death of one part of your life, and the birth of a new one. Let this serve as a collective eulogy to the things, the people, and the life I used to know. I spent most of my life tailoring my personality to everyone else's liking, but the truth is, being who you are isn't specific to an image, a language, a genre, a lifestyle, or a personal interest. The true essence of a person is fostered by his actions, his choices. I choose me. The me that believes in everyone's divine humanright to live boldly, honestly, and without apology. Allow me to reintroduce myself. My name is Chad Johnson, and I'm not your typical black guy. I shop at Hollister, I listen to rock music, and I think 2 Chainz is just a fancy name for a hardware store. (laughing) But these things, they don't define me. What defines me isn't what's seen on the surface, but what's expressed beneath it. (clapping) - Here he comes. - Yes. (laughing) (lighthearted music) (chuckling) - So, tell me, Chad. How are you feeling in this very moment? - How do I feel right now? Myself. I feel like myself. (catchy music) * Now I ain't never had much, see * * Each side dusty * Half a loaf of bread, red Kool-Aid * * And some lunch meat * Girls wouldn't touch me * Thinking I had it * Close my eyes and imagine * No matter how the situation looks * * Plates empty imagining food like the scene on Hook * (somber piano music) * How I remember the start * Hanging over the park * We talked * We were just living our names * * But new colors were made * On that walk * And I could not help * That I could not hold * My heart back from guessing * What is my goal * But lies makes you watch the thing play * * Itself on out * It's where we found * A year or two found us back here * * Through the shout and the tears * * See what's grown * And trees taller than we'd first seen * * Lean and whispered to me * That you've known * And I could not stop * My right knee from dropping * Just like your tears couldn't keep from falling * * 'Cause life's too big to not wonder * * Who stayed around * Here's where we found Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers.
