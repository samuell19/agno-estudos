Justine. Come open the door. Justine. Justine. Justine, open the fucking door. I know you're in there. You can't be doing this. Open the fucking door, Justine. I don't have the time for this. What a fucking state. Do you know what day it is? Where's my rent? I'm working on it. Don't piss about, Justine. - Okay. - Good. Oi. Hope you paid for those. Didn't grass you up, if that's what you mean. Don't worry, if they'd seen me, I'd be done by now. Didn't go anywhere, see. Hung around out here for you. Why? You're my accomplice, an accessory after the fact. You're involved. - What did you get? - Oh, just course books. - Student, thought as much. - What's wrong with being a student? Oh, nothing. What did you get? A collection of love letters written by mythological characters to absent lovers. Sounds cool. It is. Rachel. Justine. So what are you studying for? - I'm going to teach English. As a foreign language. Abroad, I'm getting my teaching certificate. You excited about that? Yeah, well, it will get me out of here. Desperate? There's only a few things you can do to get you out on your own terms. This, I think, is one of them. Why? One can drown here. One can drown anywhere. Want some? What is it? Vodka. 140% proof, Polish. - What do you do? - This and that. - What's that supposed to mean? - Quite hard, aren't you? Saved by the bell. Sorry, I have to go. See you around then. What's this? Bye. Is that about me? Have I upset you or something? No. Then stop looking at me as if I've disappointed you or I'll fucking kill you, Leanne. - How's life, Justine, in general, I mean? - Great, just great. Do you wanna talk? - About what? - I don't know, drinking. You. What's bothering you. Probation. Past, present, future. Is that amusing to you? - Very. - How so? What future? - You don't think you have one? - My future's fucked. Well you have to know what you want, Justine, as a first step, I mean. So, tell me, what is it you want? What do you really want? Nothing you can offer. Well what if things were different? You could have a fresh start? What sort of life do you see yourself living if all of this just just disappeared and you could start again? How might you see that unfolding? Come on, humour me. Okay, so, I get a job, make Mum happy, meet someone, estate agent, company car. He'll be the one. Mum will love him. And then I'll get pregnant, so we get married. Big white wedding and 10 years into it all, he'll have an affair, and at first I'll be too tired or too busy to notice, but then I find out. And when I do, I'll kill the fucker, and his mistress. And then I'll be in prison with my prison wife. And I'll spend my days wishing my kid had the life I never had. But just don't have now. Impressive. Mistress, that's an interesting choice of words. - What's the point of all this? - We have to talk. It's part of your probation agreement. What, so you can drag some kinda story out of me? - Use it against me later? - No, I'm trying to help you. - No, you're trying to get in my head. - No, I'm trying to help. It will end in tears. It always does. So fuck off and leave me alone. I see, okay. Do you mind watching my stuff for a second? Hey, hey over here! It's me. Hi. Trying to impress? Oh, I'm taking it back. Practise makes perfect, so. Have to be somewhere, sorry. That's okay. But we could go out sometime. I'll call you. Yeah, like you did the last time. - Who the fuck was that? - No one. You know you're daft to be here anyway? No. You're something else. Fucking arseholes. Work, shop, beds. What the fuck? They need to get a life, man. Like you, you mean? At least I know how to survive. When it all goes tits up, they'll be fucked. So what do you wanna do? I am not seeing nothing in here for me, but. Oh, no, that's so ugly. - Kinda look like Cruella Deville. - Yeah, it's heinous. Oh, my, baby. What do you think? And today is the bullfight. You trying to look like a sexy nun or something? I do look like a sexy nun, shut up. Maybe. Hey, ah! But it's nice. - You're not taking it. - I like it. Look at these. No, like shit. Okay, cool. But these ones, though, 100%. Oh yeah, no, that's it there. - For real? - Yeah. - Do you like this? - Yeah, it's all right. Wait, if I just roll the sleeves up. We've been made. - Where? - By the coats, right there. I told you. I reckon he thinks he can take us both? - All right, let's go. - Ready? Fucking twat. - Where to now? - Oh, I'm starving. - Can I have your phone? - Yeah, sure. Here you go. Take the phone. You came! - I thought you weren't gonna come. - Me too. We should go in if we're to catch the start, of the film. I mean, unless you wanna do something else. We don't have to go and see this film. It's kind of up to you really. Shut up. We were on a family holiday, and when we came back, it was over between them. Tried to explain it to me, I didn't cry. And then, Dad fucked off and left her. Your mum? Yeah. Do you see her now? No. She has a new daughter. We had a big fight a couple of Christmases ago. Her new boyfriend he's a cunt. He's a lovely man. What was the fight about? He caught me stealing money out of his wallet. She kicked me out. And you've been looking after yourself ever since? You don't work. - I've had jobs. - What's happened? How the fuck should I know? Look, I've had jobs. Had my flat, didn't I? Don't know. There's something wrong with me, I think. There's nothing wrong with you. I mean, look at you, you're intelligent, beautiful, articulate. That's not a single educational qualification in here. Why is that? I don't have any. That seems really odd to me. They're fucking stupid. Don't need a fucking certificate to prove that. It's a fucking waste of time. You're a health freak. Got a problem looking after yourself. Do you feel like there's no hope, Justine, is that it? Is that what's wrong? Who said there was anything wrong? Shit. Barcelona. It's just five weeks. Be good for you. Yeah, it's part of the practical exam I have to take. Yeah, that makes sense. Wanna go out? I love you. Hello, Justine. Garrett. Can I get some backy? Yes, what would you like? Cutter's choice? - Yeah, yeah, that's good, yeah. - Okay, let's see. - Can I get some filters as well? - Slim? Extra slim? - Slim is fine. - Slim. All right. Here we go. Okay. And that's 12.50. You serious? No, you're right. - You don't want? - No. - See you later, yeah. - Okay, Justine. Hey, my love. What's up? My mum got some dickhead at the house, you know. Every time, with all that shagging and I can't hack it. - Can I crash at yours? - Yeah, sure. - Want some? - No, I've got weed. Hey, you got my phone? Tart. So your girlfriend's gone? When we get home, I'm gonna make you one of those curries, yeah? One of them coomers? - Yeah. - Bird's eye? It was so so cool. We were staying in the mediaeval part of the old city, near the church. It was a fucking fabulous touch. I was so nervous. You know, first time teaching and in a place like Barcelona. Anyway, they paired me up with this guy. That wasn't so good, but we got through. Oh God, the architecture. Gaudi, Catalan, Christian. Symbolism, you know all that stuff you told me about before I went? Amazing. Did you get to see the Sagrada Familia? Yeah, my God, yes. So, so beautiful. I'd love to see that. Yeah, you'd love it there. Do you wanna go in? No. I'll race you. So you're an only child? Yeah. And you left home young? Yeah. - Why? - My revenge. Fuck off. Tell me something about you. - Something I don't know. - Like what? I don't know, something, anything. I wanna know everything. There's nothing to know. Come on. Let's just say the past can be a terrible thing and I don't particularly want one. - Is that all right with you? - Yeah. Okay. Future, any dreams? I dream of death mostly. Your death? It comes in a package marked fragile. There's a delivery guy, and he gets me to sign for it. And I do. And he passes it to me and smiles. And I accept it and laugh, even though I know what it is. I made you something. It's just a shale or something. Thank you. They've offered me a job at the school in Barcelona. And I've said yes. Cool. I want you to come with me. - When? - Got some time. It starts in a month. My work can sort us out. They can get us a flat. Okay. - Okay? - Okay. You're quiet. So are you. You know when people see us, they might think, oh, Justine, Justine, she's the strong one. That's just how it is. But if they say that to me, I'll tell them straight. Rachel, she's the strong one. She does stuff. I'm just a coward with a big mouth. Hey. Have you seen Justine? I've been to the flat a few times, and there's no answer, there's nothing. Yeah, she gets like that. Is she okay? Please. Look, the best thing you can do is just keep your nose out of it, yeah? As far as I know, she's exactly the same as when you last saw her. She's not around, that's it. Look, just go home or something. Do whatever it is you gotta do, and it'll work itself out. On the floor. And you didn't get this from me. On the side of the wall, there's a loose brick. Under it, there's a key. Thank you. Hello? Justine? Hello? Justine? Oh, Justine, Justine? Hey. Hey hey, can you hear me? Can you hear me? Uh, stay down, stay there. Hey, hey, it's gonna be okay. I'm here. I'm here. Okay. Bring it round a little bit more. Swing it around, okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey, wake up. Look at me, look at me. I'm gonna go see if you have anything to eat. I'm just gonna pop to the shop. I'll be back in five. Cool? I fucked up, Peach. Want some medicine? No, not today. - That's a nice coat. Brought you this just in case. Feeling good? You mean am I up and at them? Depressed, fed up? Do you get depressed? All the time, don't you? Well you drink a lot. That can't help. Hospitalised seven times in the last three years. - All alcohol-related. - Some was drugs. Into crack now, sometimes. Still. Can we talk about it, the alcohol, I mean? Well you know, it's just me. Okay. So what's going on? What do you think's going on? What about the life you live? Justine, the choices you make, are you not worried? - How much do you get paid for this? - Do you ever think about dying? Everyone thinks about dying. It's attractive. - What's attractive about dying, Justine? - Not feeling. - Not feeling what? - Not feeling anything. You're angry today. Why, what's made you angry? You know, the other day, I was walking down the street and this banker asked me to suck his dick on the pavement. Can you fucking believe that? I was like, you've already fucked our economy, and now you want me to suck your dick? Right, listen to me. You need to change. This has got to change. You cannot keep living your life like this. We need to sort out your addiction issues. - We? You mean me. - I wanna help. And I wanna get to know you, Justine. We can sort this out. One day soon, this will feel like someone else's life. If there is anything you need, day or night, anything at all, anytime, I am here. Okay? You think of me as a friend. Nice coat. You know, this place looks a lot like my grandma's. She's dead now, so. What are you doing here? I thought I'd take in the air. Where have you been? Forgetting you. Why? - I think it's best. For who? Actually, don't worry too much, because I'm gonna be leaving soon. Yeah, that's what I thought. You know, I used to hang out with this girl at school. We were like 13, and I really fancied her, but she didn't know. One night, we were staying at her house, and we snuck into the kitchen, and there was this huge bottle of wine on the side. And we were like, fuck. And she dared me to drink some, and I didn't wanna look like a pussy, so I had some. And, it was rank. But we drank it all. I felt so fucking cool with her, in that kitchen. When I drink, I really love myself. And, I feel safe. I feel safe. I can make you feel safe. And I want to. I want you to come with me. I can't. I need to sort my shit out. The key doesn't work. I changed the locks. Didn't you get the email, darling? How's the kid? Michaela. Your sister's name is Michaela. - Why did you call her that? - Why are you here, Justine? I need some money. Jesus, that's a surprise. What for? To pay my rent. - My landlord's a cunt... - Justine. Look, I'm good. I'm straight. Well, I'm not straight. But. What don't you understand about that? What's happening to you? - You won't believe me. - So try me. I'm fucking this girl. And her name's Rachel. And we're in love. We're gonna move to Barcelona together. Listen to yourself. You look terrible. Look, if you wanna help me, just give me some money so I can pay the rent, and then I'll get outta your way. No. Why are you being such a bitch? I'll be out in the street. Is that what you want? Why are you punishing me? Punishing you? Seriously? We gave you everything. Everything. The best schools, a nice home. Encouragement, support. - No, you fucked up my life. - Oh really? How so? You never fucking listened to me. You've never once asked me what I want in life. You don't give a shit about who I am. You don't fucking know me. You're fucking, you're fucking delusional. Grow up, for Christ sake! You had it all. You can still have it. But you don't love me. I just need some money. Please? No. This is fucking bullshit. I fucking hate you. Like you hate yourself? Two years. Justine, two years. Have you any idea how worried I've been? Do you? Do you even care? You could have done anything with your life, with your talent. Anything. You, you are breaking my heart, Justine. Are you gonna help me or not? Not. Here I am trying to sort my shit out, and you're fucking it up again. What do you think you're fucking doing? What, you don't wanna talk to us? Oh, she don't wanna talk to us. Bitch. Fcking slag. Fuck, it's you. Hello, Justine, long time no see. - How long have I been here? - 24 hours, give or take. You're lucky to be alive. Okay, breathe in and out, please. Okay, and again. Okay, lie back. Your love affair with this hospital just goes on and on, doesn't it? You must like it, Justine, you keep coming back. How many times is this? I didn't get a Christmas card this year. Okay, tell me if you feel any pain, okay? Am I okay, Doc? For now, yeah. You still love me, Doc? Justine, you're a smart young woman with your life ahead of you. But you have to stop drinking. Not pause, stop. Don't stop, die. It's as simple as that. You didn't answer the question. Justine, I will always love you. You know that. See you in a bit. Fuck this. Can I just get two of those? That's all I got, so tomorrow, yeah? Please. Tomorrow, Justine. Justine, open the fucking door. May it be that she still favours me. May she still quiet the surges of my heart. As she calms the tumult of the wave. May it be granted to me that with her help my pleasures will find safer.
