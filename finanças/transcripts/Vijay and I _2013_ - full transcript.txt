But sir, for me it's difficult... Rainer... go ahead. You always loved to dress up. Come, Rainer, let's get something to drink. Hi, Willy! What are you doing here? - Rainer! You're staying for dinner? Come, Rainer, let's get a drink. Where is the bus stop? Third street to the left. May I see your passport? Are you new here? Where are you from? Where is the toilet? All the way in the back, you can't miss it. Glad to welcome the biggest jerk in the world. Thank you. Thank you. ONE YEAR LATER
