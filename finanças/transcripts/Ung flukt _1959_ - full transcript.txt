THE WAYWARD GIRL - Is it far? - I don't quite remember. I can't recognise it. No, I can't recognise anything. In one way or the other. It's all happened so fast. Yesterday I had no idea. You're educated. Spanish city, two letters? - Pio. - No city, and it's three letters. I prefer the serious picture. It's more academic. - What do you think, Anders? - I don't know. Mum, can't we take Gerd to the country? - There's no space. - I can camp outside in the tent. - Anders, it's not just the space. - I know you don't like Gerd. You don't think she's good enough, but you don't know her. She's lonely. She's lost her job, and her mother's never home. She's a travelling saleswoman for washing detergent. Mum, couldn't it be nice? Anders, I honestly think you need some time away from Gerd. - But don't you understand ... - I think the discussion is over. - Can I borrow the car tonight? - Where are you going? Gerd and I are going to the cinema. Fresh air is better for you. It looks like she needs it. - I'll pay for the petrol. - It's not that. You could spend your money on something more sensible. I wonder what he sees in her. She's rude and up for anything. Our educated son disagrees. Ah ... "Idyll"! - We need to talk. - No. Tomorrow. - I've waited for you all night! - I'm tired. Gerd! Still here? What do you want? - Where have you been? - I don't remember. Here and there. Not another third degree, please. I've just been with the police. - I know. - I haven't done anything wrong. They were after some smugglers, and I got dragged in. They let me go pretty quick, but now I'm in their book. - We were going to the cinema. - That's right. But I met Kari, and ... Well, you know. I've been thinking all night. You must get away from that crowd. Let's go away! Take me away, then. If you can. Or get away yourself. Gerd, let's go away! Do you hear? - Just you and me. - Have you inherited? I'll pick you up tomorrow night. I can't get the car before then. Be ready. We'll go to the country, Gerd! Tomorrow night. You promise? - You got a cigarette? - No, you finished the pack. You're just like all the others. You'll just use me while it's fun. But if you haven't got any fags, I'm not going. Drop me off! Are you crazy? I have more cigarettes, but you'll have to wait. - What will your dad say? - I'm just borrowing the car. - Keep quiet and let me handle it. - Have you got any extra petrol? - No, we're almost empty, too. - Sorry to bother you, then. - Is it far? - I don't think so. It's just past the general store. - What will your mother say? - I don't know. But the cops want me to testify. They'll alert the social services. - She'll probably visit again. - Who? This social worker. She came last year when I'd run away from school. With a boy. He stole a car, but we didn't even get to Str?mstad. What a mess! Answer when you're spoken to! - I'm not going back to that school! - You have no say in this. No one can force you, but you can't just drift around. - I can help you find another job. - What kind of job? We'll see. You must promise me not to get fired again. - I'll think about it. - Be polite, Gerd! I'm so worried. If only I'd known how bad it was. It would help if you found a job in town. Gerd needs supervision. I'll try, of course, but I don't know. I'll see you later. - Thanks for coming. - It's my duty. Call if you need me. I will. I just need to recover. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Thank you. Well done! Don't you even consider your own mother? I thought you'd learned your lesson. I'll have to watch you day and night. Don't change jobs for my sake. I'll clear out if I want to. - You little whore! - Whores do it for money. What I've done, I've done for pleasure. - What about you? - Now watch it! If you'd watched it, I never would have been born. We'd both have been better off. And my dad. I've never seen a picture of him. Do you even know who he is? I've always wanted a dad. I was always alone. I needed someone to talk to. The night we met, I was so lonely I would've gone with anyone. You were lucky, then. Anders, does it hurt you that I've had other lovers? - Yes. - I wasn't in love with any of them. I don't think I can really love anyone. I'll help you if you really want me to. I'll try. I really want to. It's freezing! Start walking. You'll get warm. - Is it far to the cabin? - What cabin? - We'll have to stay somewhere. - Wait and see. Don't you have any other shoes? It's only the first bit that's steep. - You know this area well? - I was here hunting with my dad. - Then they'll know where we are. - Dad won't send the police after us. No, don't fall asleep. Come on! - There's a bed for us, I hope. - Don't expect any luxury. I've always wanted a bed of my own. White in daytime and black at night. With a black bedspread made of lace. As light as a cobweb. One that you can lift off with two fingers. And underneath, all pure and white. Give me a bed like that, and I'll stay with you for ever! It's not like Anders to just take the car. What if he's had an accident? Can't you call the police? The police? Anders is as good a driver as I am. I'm late. Can I have my lunch, please? It's probably this Gerd again. Anders can look after himself. Not just cheese, please. She's a hussy, that's what she is. It'll all work out when he goes to college in the autumn. - And we were going on holiday. - Don't worry. He'll come back. I'll just have to take the tram to the office. lt'll do me good. My legs ... Is there no end to this forest of yours? - Yes. - I'm not used to this. Wait till you've gone barefoot for a month. Your legs are so pale. You'll soon have a tan all over. You won't have to wear clothes. You can put them in the old chest. You're giving me a headache with all your talk. I want a coke ... - Come on. It's not far now. - To your hunting lodge. Here it is! Here's our home. It's been empty for years. We'll have it to ourselves. I can't give you the keys. We don't lock our doors. Nobody steals here. What do you think? Not bad, is it? No one's been here since Dad and I were here. Look at this cupboard. It must be a hundred years old. There should be an old pot here. There it is! We can use it for boiling water. Not exactly the bed of your dreams. I'll get some sprigs of spruce. The softest baby sprigs. It's the best thing you can lie on. We'll get settled. Let's start with the worst bits. - Got a cig? - Oh, you're alive. Have mine. It's on the table. It's paraffin. I've got some gin as well. For medicinal purposes. - What are we going to eat? - Crispbread, biscuits, butter ... - Cheese, marmelade, and salami. - And for dinner? There's lots of fish, and berries in the forest. Tomorrow's menu is fresh trout with melted butter and wild strawberries. - Without cream. - Cream is fattening. - Maybe we're wanted by the police. - No. Why would we be? We haven't done anything. We're on holiday, just like everybody else. I was supposed to testify. Is it a criminal offence to run away? No. Don't worry about that now. If only I had some other shoes! Have some food. Old, deserted houses are so tranquil. Nobody lurking in the windows. Nobody is prying. Nobody cares what you do. - What if there are ghosts? - We are the ghosts. We've returned. A hundred years ago to this day, you drowned yourself in the well. - And I hanged myself in the barn. - You scare me! You see? We are the ghosts! The rest is sports. They didn't report any accidents. Thank God. But I feel so worried. Shouldn't we report him missing? And have it broadcast all over? I wouldn't want that for any of us. But we'll consider it. That was the news. They didn't mention us. No one in the whole world is missing us! We miss each other. - What are you doing? - I found it in the barn. It'll be perfect for our bed. - Feel how soft it is. - No! Get it off me! Gerd! - Now we'll be as gentle as lambs. - I won't be your lamb. - You don't want any lambs either? - No, thanks. Not with you. Maybe it's ram's fur. - It must have been a big ram, then. - Or maybe both ram and ewe. - Is that what it's called? - Yes, my ewe. My own, sweet ram. - Gerd ... Are you happy now? - I've never been this happy. Gerd? I'm going away for a few days. Don't worry. I'm fine. That's it. It's finished. Turn around. - Did you only find empty shells? - This time of year, yes. I like nuts. - There'll be plenty in the autumn. - In the autumn? You'll never get this knot undone. You'll have to wear this forever. - Are you singing? - No, you're hearing things. - I'm tipsy. Do you mind? - Not when you're with me. - Which song was it? - Song? Yes. You said I was singing. I know a really dirty song. I just can't remember the start. - Start with the end, then. - A girl sang it on the ship. - On that ship? - Yes. Wasn't it? - Maybe on another ship. - You haven't been on many ships. No. But I've been on one that you know about. - You're drunk. - Aren't you? I don't know that song after all. I was lying. Stop now. You'll just get sick. It's empty. Were you thirsty? Wait! That bottle could come in handy. Yes, as a vase. I want globeflowers. No, daisies. To bless our house. Yes. I want daisies. Wait here. How many do you want? Just one. The biggest. I only need one. - You shall have it. You happy, then? - Yes. There you are. I'll get some water. Wife, mistress, virgin, whore ... Wife, mistress, virgin, whore ... - Are you ruining it? - ... whore! Don't talk like that! - Don't ask such questions. - I can't help it! That was all. I just danced for them. I just danced. Danced ... - For whom? - On that ship. I just danced for them. Why didn't the police tell us before? It took a few days before the sheriff started wondering about the car. - Nice man, by the way. - Who? Sheriff Dahl. Passionate hunter. Won't you come along? I don't want to see him with that girl. She's a hussy! In that case our son is turning her into one right now. If indeed they're together. You will bring him home, won't you? If I find them. I can hardly force them. - He's under age. - He's no child, either. - When do you want breakfast? - The train leaves at 9.10 am. 7.30 as usual. Gerd? Gerd! Gerd! Gerd ... It's sheep! I want a sheep. Are you making fun of me? It was nice of you to come. I'd forgotten how far it was. I'm so tired. Can't we take a sheep with us? Just as a pet. - Are you mad at me? - You just ran off. - You want to go to town. - No, Anders. Not anymore. - Why did you run? - Just a whim, I guess. - You're tired of me. - No. You're tired of me. Me? But I love you. - You just want my body. - No, Gerd. And we're almost out of food. We've only got crispbread. - Hardly any butter or coffee left. - We have fish and berries. - I'll go to the general store. - Yes! For ice cream and coke. If the car is still there, we can go to town. Go to the cinema! Go dancing! You have money ... You didn't notice me taking it. Keep it. You want to go to town. No, take it. - You see? I steal, too. - You're good at borrowing. - What are those plants? - Potatoes. - Early spring potatoes? - They are now. I'll go up to the sheep. - Excuse me. Mr. Hemse? - Yes. How lucky! You're the fourth person I ask. - I'm Gerd's mother. - I see. Hello. Thanks for calling me about the car. I guessed you'd be on this train. - You don't mind me joining you? - No, I suppose not. Maybe you think I'm pushy, but I didn't want to stay at home. I had to join the search. I can't stop you. But we don't know for sure if they're together. I certainly hope they are! I mean ... - You've probably heard about Gerd? - I don't like gossip. Unfortunately there's a lot to say about my daughter. Maybe I'm to blame. I've never had enough time for her. I've tried to talk to her. Advise her. Scare her ... But it's hard to talk about those things with your own child. - Sexual subjects, I mean. - I think most parents become shy. We're only parents as long as they are children. If only she'd been a boy! I've always been better at talking to men. - Anders, go back and hide it. - What? Didn't you see the sheep dumping a load? - That won't harm the road. - It's a clue. Go back and remove it. There's a lot of sheep droppings here. Yes, but not fresh. Someone might look for the sheep today! - I won't go any further. - All right! Bad sheep, leaving clues behind! You know what this flower is called? I'm so ignorant about those things. I know so little. I'm so stupid. Are you a boy, or a girl? I don't even know that. Anders knows a lot of things. But he is pretty childish. When he grows up, he'll be much too good for me. And too clever. Do you understand why he loves me? He even thinks I'm a lot worse than I really am. The droppings are gone. You can sleep tonight. Come here if you want a kiss. - Gerd, are we happy now? - Almost. That's quite a lot. Nice sandwiches. - No, thanks. I'm full. - I've got some for the fugitives. They must be hungry, living on fresh air and love. Imagine their faces when we turn up! The father of the groom and the mother of the bride. - It's not a wedding. - No, I guess it's too late for that. I don't think Gerd will ever marry. Or me. You must think I'm terribly candid. I feel that I know you. You remind me of Anders. He's so straightforward. Do you think he loves her? What if she's pregnant? - I'm sure they take care. - Yes. Young people are wiser today. Yes. Accidents are rare now, as far as I know. - Let's go back. - We have to bring them home. I wonder how Gerd will react. She doesn't understand that I only mean well. Maybe they're just being happily romantic? And then we'll barge in and spoil it all. - Somebody's here, that's for sure. - That's Gerd's underwear. - We'll have to venture closer. - No, wait. I'm nervous. Yes, but we must be responsible parents. Oh, dear! - It's no laughing matter! - They looked so sweet and innocent. Innocent? I'm not sure about that. They must be decent now. - You go first. - No, we're in this together. Don't they have any manners? Showing up uninvited. Come in! Oh, God ... - So this is your hiding place. - I've been so worried, Gerd. Nice tan you have. You both look good. - I brought some coffee. - Lovely! I'd love a cup. It's a nice place you have here. So secluded. Lots of atmosphere. Nice catch! I'll go and clean them. - How are you, Anders? - Fine. I'll get some more firewood. Now it's you and me, Gerd .... - How did you catch the fish? - With a spinner. - Seen any hares? - Only one small litter. - It's quite pale, this fish. - It's river trout. It's fine. - Your mum was really scared. - I'm sorry. - Aren't you ashamed? - Yes. About the car. And her. This girl ... - Is she worth it? - I haven't calculated. You live with her. She must mean something to you. Yes. She does. - Have you come to take us back? - Otherwise mum wouldn't forgive me. She'll have to. - Quit while you're ahead. - It's not a game! - You might have to marry her. - If I do it's not because I have to. Mum and I have high hopes for you. Give me some time, Dad. That's all I ask. Get me some water. Give me an answer! That's the least you can do. - Stop pestering me! - You're a shrew! I got that from you. I've always wanted what's best for you. Depends on what you mean by that. You've always been wild. And all these friends of yours ... Stick with Anders. Maybe he can tame you. I hate people who want to change me. So don't worry. And stop putting it on. His dad won't fall for it. Those trout look great! It's a real feast. How good you are! All we did was gossip. Let's have some food. You certainly know how to stock up. I only brought sandwiches. I brought a bit of everything, just in case. With this, Gerd and Anders can get by another week. Along with fish and berries and romance. Mum! What do the young ones say? I expect you'll want to stay on? You can come with us in the car. - We're in no hurry. - We'll stay here. Well, at least we know where they are. You're so right. I'm so relieved. - I wish my wife was, too. - Sorry. I'm always so selfish. But Gerd ... Did Anders teach you manners? - We only have the two. - We didn't expect a full set. Aren't they sweet? Even with their clothes on. Don't worry about your dad. He'll come back unharmed. I've wanted to see you for a long time. We must put an end to this. - Do you think? - Yes, indeed. It's been almost two weeks. It's embarrassing. Not for the kids, I hope. Kids? Yes, they are kids. That's what makes it so hopeless. Please sit down. I have put the kettle on. Don't worry. For all I know, the couch is pristine. But I'm seldom home, as you know. And young people will always find a place to be together. At least now they don't have to do it on the sly. I don't understand your attitude to all this. What if something goes wrong? It's always hardest on the girl. - What if she gets pregnant? - A child? It never crossed my mind. - That's the kettle. Excuse me. - Don't go to any trouble. I think we could both do with a cup of strong tea. I've always found that tea calms the nerves. It looks good. Thank you. - Sugar? Milk? - My goodness, no. Please help yourself. I'm worried that they're not right for each other. I should be the one to worry about that. Anders has to think of his future. He's going to study engineering. I won't blame him if he leaves her. - He'll have to take responsibility. - Gerd won't hold him back. - But if she gets pregnant ... - Let's hope not! I'm desperate. I thought my husband would bring Anders home. This can't go on. We must help each other. - We must do something. - Yes. Perhaps. I just can't see how. Please have some more. It's as good as new. Now we can chop wood for winter. You promised we could go to the shop. What's the rush? - Then we must kill the sheep. - It's not ours. - You stole potatoes. - That's different. - I'll do it, then. - This has killed lots of animals. - Put it down! - Are you scared? - I don't like axes. - Shall I strangle the sheep? - You're just bragging. Put it away! - We'll bleed it dry like this ... You wouldn't dare. - Don't you think? - Not until I see it. - You do it, then. - Fine. - You don't seem to enjoy it. - I do, Anders. Not really. Why don't you scream: "I want to die, because life can't get any better!" - You barely live at all. - I can't help it. - Don't you want to? - Yes, but I can't. - It will come. - What? - The pleasure. Your pleasure. - Do you feel it? When you do, I will. We'll kill the sheep tonight. Will that make you happy? Don't expect too much. You're good with a knife. - Good evening. - Hello ... I'd be glad to help out. Let's hang it up. lt'll be easier to skin, then. It's dark in here. Don't you have a flashlight? - No. - I'll lend you mine, then. - The owner of the sheep? - I don't know. Good work. Though I'm no butcher. - Do I look like a butcher? - No. - Have a smoke. - Thanks. - You sure needed that. - Thanks for your help. Are you staying here? - We rented it for the summer. - Really? Secluded spot. - We're on holiday. - So am I. - Are you going far? - Not tonight. - A cup of coffee for the butcher? - No, we're out. - I'll treat you, then. - Thank you. - You don't have to leave tonight. - That's kind of you. Take this, will you? The coffee is at the top of the pack. I need to wash. There's a lake here, isn't there? - I'll sink the carcass, too. - Put the kettle on, Anders. Haven't you fired up? - I thought you stayed with him. - Nonsense! There could soon be plenty of that. - Don't you like people? - Some people. - Without him ..? - We'd eaten wool with sheep on it. - What's he done to you? - Nothing. Yet. - What's he done to you? - Nothing yet. - Is he staying the night? - Don't know. It's not our house. Maybe it's his. I wouldn't be surprised. The girl and the boy met by the gate the girl said: "Come in, though it is late" "but do nothing you'll regret or time will hang on your hands. " Don't touch his stuff. He's got bread! - And something soft. It's butter! - Leave it. - I take what I can get. - I'm not having any. Come in. It's cosy in here. Turn it off, please. It makes me nervous. H-bombs and disasters all day. If it was mine I'd throw it - - in the lake, too. One is more human without it. - Don't you like music, either? - Not here. I want peace. - Too bad we were here, then. - I had no idea who would be here. It could've been a normal farm for all I knew. - Have you been here before? - No. You seem to know everything. The path to the lake. It was there. That's better. You don't have to know a path to follow it. - Nice cupboard. - Feel free to look inside. They made beautiful handicraft in the old days. Just what I thought! Always a secret drawer. But never so secret that you can't find it. Any silver coins, I wonder? No, just paper. "Bendik Blackwater's copybook." "Bendik Blackwater, born September 1, 1918." "Blackwood. Blackie ... Bendik Blackwater." A man of many names. Bendik Blackwater ... - Can I stay here tonight? - Take the fur rug. I've got a sleeping bag. It's nice to have something underneath you. Get the rug, Anders. Don't go to any trouble for my sake. I'll sleep in the barn. I'll be fine in the barn. The bed won't hold three, and you won't hold two. Hello? Don't you want breakfast? - Is that really necessary? - My lips were dry. - Did you see him? - No. - Are your nails dry, too? - You're mean. - Isn't it pretty? - Yes. - Morning. - Coffee's almost ready. - Sounds good. - Have you been out hunting? I was just exploring. Looking for game. The hunting season doesn't start till September 20. What are we going to live off until then? I might as well confess. The fox is to blame. He had the bird in his mouth when I shot him. I aimed for the fox and hit the bird. Sheep one day, blackcock the next. This is paradise! Do you know how to handle a cock? Not the feathered kind. It needs to hang for a few days. I should be going soon, but you're such nice company. - So if you don't mind ... - We're leaving soon, anyway. - Eat the sheep first. - We're almost out of salt. I've got salt. Dinner, yes. If you put the potatoes on at ... Let's say ... Come here, I'll show you. Put them on when the sun's just above that ridge. Around 3 o'clock. - How do you know? - I figured it out. Gerd, the coffee's boiling! Nice chops, if you like lamb. But blackcock, that'll be a feast. If the sauce is right. - You have cream, I hope? - No. - We'll go to the shop, then. - Yes, let's! - We talked about it. - Tomorrow night. - Too hot to walk in the sun. - When do they close? Closing hours are flexible out here. And they might be missing the sheep. We'd better keep a low profile and go after hours. I won't have anything to do with this. Come on! Don't go! - Get some cokes, too. - I already have. Come on! - Lose something? - What's keeping you? Shut up and take the rucksack. I forgot cigarettes. You go ahead. I'll follow. The girl and the boy met by the gate the girl said: "Come in, though it is late" "but do nothing you'll regret or time will hang on your hands" next morning the boy said to his little friend: "l have to go away, but I will soon be back again" "so do nothing you'll regret or time will hang on your hands. " - Put your top on! - It's so hot. The girl and the boy went to visit the priest and from the woods there came the strangest breeze: "Do nothing you'll regret or time will hang on your hands. " - You want some, kid? - I'm not hungry. It's probably lack of sleep that makes you so grouchy. I'll go and salt the sheep's meat. Take whatever you want. Just pretend you're home. - Stop that! - Jesus ... Do you know what we did? It was a break-in! - It was exciting. - Can't you see that this is serious? They might not notice at all. It was just a few things. It's not whether they notice or not. It's how you feel about it. He thinks he's got me now, but I paid for everything. Remember the note? I left that for the grocer. Did you get a receipt? - Have you seen Bendik? - No. - You don't have to dress up for me. - I do it for my own sake. - It's stolen goods! - You're crazy. - Where's the necklace? - I don't know. - How did you untie the knot? - I must have lost it. - Make me a new one. - There aren't any more nuts. - Here's your scarf. - What if we left now? If you want to, we'll pack up straight away. No, just leave everything and go away. We can at least go swimming. I've never felt this dirty. We'd better turn back now. Here's the cold current. You'll be too tired. If we swim across, we'll have to walk back. Have you never wanted to swim too far and not come back? - Turn back! - I don't know if I want to. - You never know what you want. - Let go! I don't care what happens. If you kill yourself you kill me, too. I'll stay with you, I promise! - You're a sow. - I know. Are you still here? We thought you'd left. I will, eventually. Maybe tomorrow. Don't worry if I'm suddenly gone. Here today, gone tomorrow, that's me. Better for you if I just disappeared. You could blame everything on me. But I always say goodbye to friends. - And we're friends, aren't we? - Yes. It's a good girl you have, Anders. As long as it lasts. Well, I'll hit the sack. Much is forgiven if he leaves tomorrow. For good. - Will that make you happy? - Very. And you? It's just me. What do you want? - Take me with you when you go. - That depends. - Where do you want to go? - Anywhere. Just away from here. - No. - Yes! I've never met a girl with so much "yes" in her. - No ... - How old are you? 1 8? - Soon. - I thought so. I know women. I'm too old for you, I suppose. I could be your dad. - Yes ... - Are you tired of the boy? We have to get away from each other. Take me with you. I'm not going tonight. Maybe tomorrow, or later. - Just say when. Promise me. - It's hard to say no to you. I thought the boy wasn't enough for you? I don't know. Don't ask. You little whore! We'll wait till we're alone, then. You did want company, didn't you? - Whatever kind? - I just have to get away. I'll say when. But don't rough up your dad. - Is it strange that men want you? - They just want my body. And you don't want to? Poor young man. - Don't be mad. - No. - I'll keep my part of the deal. - Thanks. - What are you up to? - Sitting. Where have you been? - Right here. - If you go to him, I'll kill you! We must leave, Gerd. Before something terrible happens. You go. Give up Gerd. Can't you see that she's hopeless? - You're just like other women. - Do you know about other women? They want a man. A home. Children. - Maybe I can't have children. - You're made for it. - Maybe it's already there. - I daren't think about it. It's my mum! - You got a scooter? - I just borrowed it. - It's too far to walk. - Why are you here? The game is over. Your parents are coming tomorrow, Anders. I thought we could celebrate your last night here. I'll contribute a blackcock. Oh my! You have lodgers now? - Sonja Gertsen. - Bendik Blackwater. But then this is your farm! Probably. It's worthless enough to be mine. Excuse me. I'm tired. I'll go and sleep. - Never mind me. - Please take this, Anders. - How are things with you and Anders? - Don't know. That's what I came to find out. And this Bendik ..? You were tired, remember. - It's a good, young cock. - You're good at cooking. Will you get the cream, ladies? Two tins of cream will soften him just right. Can you smell it? Fresh spruce shoots, delicate as asparagus. And berries. You're Gerd's mother? You look like sisters. I am her mother. But we're very different. I think you're equally pretty. It's dangerous being a cock around you two. - You'll be lonely when they leave. - I'm leaving, too. - Probably tomorrow morning. - Where is Anders? The young cock stays away until the old cock's back is turned. Go and get him, Gerd. - Don't you like people? - Some people. - Are you jealous of your mum? - Look who's talking. It's not my fault that she's a fool. - In 24 hours we're no longer here. - No. - Where will we be then? - I don't know. Do you? - No. - Give me a puff. - You seem like a dangerous man. - Yes, I'm not your best bet. I'm still pale from my previous lodgings. I didn't mean dangerous in that way. I was thinking of Gerd. - I wish you would ... - Keep my hands off? Here's the young cock. Have a drink, Anders. Cheer up, Anders! I'm starving. Surely your bird must be finished soon? Give him a few minutes to contemplate all his sins. It must be great to enter purgatory in a cream sauce. It's his final mating call. The heather is teeming with hens. Have you ever heard the mating call? - Chicks! - Shame on you, Anders! - I'm exhausted. - You spellbind us, Bendik. The bird in the pan! That's a real feast. But then, it is his farewell party. Hello! It's the police! Gather the loot. Get dressed. We'll wait outside. - What do we do now? - Stay here. The safest place is where the police have just been. POLlCE - Nasty business, that sheep. - I'll make up for it, of course. Fine. There won't be any charges concerning the sheep. Bendik Blackwater was an accessory, wasn't he? He just skinned it. We'd already killed it. - "We"? - I ... I killed it. - Gerd had no part in the break-in? - No. No, our old friend Bendik is our main man, of course. Up to his old tricks. The potatoes are just petty theft, we'll say. I'll make up for them, too, naturally. In that case I'll consider the two minor matters closed. - Against a reasonable compensation. - Thank you. Then there is the matter of the break-in. I have reason to believe the young lady was part of it. - Gerd didn't steal anything! - No? Do you recognise this? - I made it. - We found it in the store. - Is this relevant? - Details are important. Don't get me wrong. I can't ignore this break-in. It's a serious matter Not just for Bendik. - For the youngsters, too. - They'll have to be punished. - Any idea where the others are? - No. We've sent out a warning, so we'll have them soon. They'll have to buy food sooner or later. - Will that be all? - Are you leaving? You won't get off that easily. We haven't had a chat about hunting for a while. Come and have supper with us. I left some money. Didn't the grocer find that? - No. - Is that true, Anders? Yes, Dad. We'll have to investigate it. That's mitigating circumstances. You've made a full confession, so you're a relatively free man. But stay until we find the other two. Let's go to my private rooms. Anders? - Where's Gerd? - Put down the axe. - What have you done to her? - Put down the axe, I said! - Anders! Where's Bendik? - He's dead. Bendik! Anders! Anders, help me! He's alive! - How is he? - He seems better. - Were you going to go with him? - Just to get away. - He never touched me. - I could have killed him. Over me? - Did you put the axe down, boy? - Yes. It was a hell of a fire. And I'm badly insured. - I could have died. - Gerd saved you. Thanks, Gerd. I enjoy living. You saved Anders, too. - Do you understand that? - Yes. - How do you feel? - Go home now. You can't lie here alone. I'll have to. You won't come to bed with me. Take the girl and leave. She needs a father. Not for herself, but for the kid. You didn't know that, did you? She confided in me, you see. Not you. Now I want you both out of my sight. Both of you. Leave, before something worse happens. - You go too, Bendik! - That's easier said than done. I've lost my shoes. Can't you give him your shoes, Anders? The girl and the boy went to visit the priest and from the woods there came the strangest breeze: "Do nothing you'll regret or time will hang on your hands."
