It lies behind the shrubs filled with treacherous thorns. Dina, why haven't you prepared the table? Yes, just a minute. Many beetles meet their doom the thorns become their tomb. Oh what a shame. You gave your heart. What is this good smell? This chicken stew or you? You're startling me, Dear. / Are you surprised or excited? Astagfirullahaladzim, Father, Mother. Act your age. I don't want another brother. See? You should be more like your mother. She's quick, skillful, a good cook. At her age, your mother still looks beautiful. Nowadays, boys are attracted to girls with insights. Cooking is not a big deal, just order takeout. Why are you saying that? / Can you gain any insight? If you only read detective novels everyday? Of course I do. They say life is full of mysteries. Now, it is a detective's job to solve those mysteries. Where is that Andi? He must've got caught in the rain. Let him be, he's a big boy. I'm sure he'll be back soon. Oh, you. Mother, tell that brother of mine. Don't ride his bike too fast, moreover in rainy season like this. Yesterday, he almost got hit by a another bike. Honey! Honey! Din, call the village chief now. Now! Honey! Honey! Honey! Let's go to the doctor! Dear God! Honey! Din, hurry! Hurry, Din! Honey! Honey! Father! Honey! Honey! I Father! Father! Father! Father! KAFIR KAFIR Allied with Satan Thank you, Sir. Thank you. Thank you, Sir. Mother. Stop staring blankly like that, you'll get possessed. Din. You know. Before 40 days after a funeral... a person's spirit still lingers. That means... Your father is still with us. Excuse me, Ma'am. My sickle is no longer sharp. I need to get a replacement from my house. Alright. Oh, right, Sir. Did you finished repairing my room's leaking ceiling? I did, yesterday. Alright. Mother, why do we need another person to fix the house? Tell that brother of mine to do it. You spoil him too much. Besides, he should take Father's role. It's alright, Din. He came to me looking for work. No harm in helping people. Come in, Num. Who's he with? Mother. Mother. This is Hanum. Hanum. I just cooked dinner. Why don't you join us? There was once a story. Turn it off, Andi! I don't want to hear it! What's wrong, Mother? It's a good song. I'm trying to make this house lively again. It has been quiet for too long. It feels like a ghost house. Andi, turn it off! Why did you turn it off? Huh? Oh. That was my father's favorite song. But Mother still can't stand hearing it. Sis Hanum, how did you meet my brother Andi? Why are you so curious? Stop pretending to be a detective. What's with you? At the campus. I cater meals for the cafeteria at Andi's campus. Oh? What kind of meal? Many kinds, Ma'am. Crispy chicken, steamed fish. I also make cakes, sponges, pastels, things like that. You made them yourself? With my Mama. Mother is also a great cook. Next time, I'll bring some of my dish, alright, Ma'am? Oh, right, Mother. Hanum just moved here. Two months ago, right? Oh really? Ooh. A new student? You act quickly, don't you? What are you saying? It's like we're destined to meet, right, Num? Oh dear. Poor girl. Really? There, there, stop bickering. What's wrong, Mother? It's nothing. Come, let's eat. I'm jealous of your family. Why? Because we're noisy? It's warm. It used to be warmer when Father was still here. What happened to your father? Father... Had a heart attack. It was just a month ago. So I still can't believe it happened. Yeah, It's tough. Especially for Mother. Until now, Mother still can't let go of him. In fact... She stops making chicken stew, my father's favorite dish. She even refuse to wear the dress she wore that night my father died... Mother! Ow. Din. Mother! I'll help you up, Mother. What's wrong, Mother? Huh? I don't know. I suddenly felt a pain in my calf. Goodness. How did it happened? Andi. Andi. Honey? Get some rest, Mother. Don't have too much on your mind. Mister Salim. Mister Salim! Yes, Ma'am? How come the ceiling in my room still leak? Didn't you fixed it? Right, I will fix it again. Assalamualaikum. Walaikumsalam. Mother. You're home early, Ndi. / My professor didn't come, Mother. Mother, please make me chicken stew. I want some. You know I don't make that anymore, Ndi. Ndi? Let's eat. Andi? Assalamualaikum. Mother? Mother, It's me, Andi. You... You just came? Yes, I just got here. What's wrong, Mother? Somebody came, looks just like you. Then he entered your room. He asked me to make him chicken stew. That can't be, Mother. I know you don't make that anymore. Come here, Mother. Come here. Come here. I know you were just missing me. That's why you were like that. Come. See? There's nothing there. Why don't you just get some rest, okay? Hanum is coming, bringing her dish. So you don't have to cook anything. What happened, Mother? You don't have to stare at her like that. Careful, you'll drool. I'm seriously staring at my future wife. Sheesh. I made this especially for you, Ma'am. I'm experimenting on chicken soup. But I always fail. You don't like it? It's not that. Mother also made chicken soup this afternoon, but she spilled it. What a coincidence. You should try this. Do you like it? It's good. You made it so well. Wow, she's now a legitimate future wife, huh? She has Mother's blessings. Come try this. "Layu Sebelum Berkembang"? That's right! You're so smart. Brother, your songs are too old. Play something else. What are you saying? I you can't guess, don't get upset. Okay, next song. "Widuri". / You're right again. Mother? I think the storm is getting worse. Let Hanum stay here tonight, Mother. That's right, Sis. It's dangerous traveling in stormy weather like this. Yes. Hanum should stay here tonight. But don't forget to tell your mother. Hanum can sleep in Andi's room. That's right, Sis. Let my brother sleep on the couch. Your leg still hurts? What's wrong, Mother? Nothing. I just feel like, since your father's gone... There have been many strange things happening. What strange things? It seems there are... I'll get the lantern, Mother. Mother, you're acting like a little girl. Brother? That's not funny! Not funny! What wrong? It's nothing. Just a kid looking for attention. Dina! Mother. Use this for her room. Mother! I'll write you a prescription, for sedatives. Some people, still believe in shamans. Drink your medicine, Ma'am. Din. What did the doctor say? I checked it again, Ma'am. The ceiling... It's in good condition. The roof is not leaking as well. Even when it rains, the water should've pass through. Ma'am. This is my last day working here. I will tend the front yard now. What I preserve. Are everything that I deserve. This feelings of love. That you placed in my heart's trove. What I asked for. Are everything that I adore. Your smile makes me realize. That I'm in paradise. Radiant romance. In lovers each other's glance. Oh my yearning. Radiant romance. I see your mother still can't forget about your father. Yeah, it must be hard for her to lose him. Yes, Mother was my father's true love. He gave her so much attention. That means she's so special in his eyes. How fortunate, for your mother to have a husband like him. Soon... You too will be as fortunate as my mother. You'll have me as a husband. Sweet talker! I should skip school tomorrow. No. Don't skip class. I don't like it. I'm fine. Mother. We all miss Father. But if we don't let go, he won't rest in peace there, Mother. Moreover if you get sick, he'll be sad, Mother. Alright, Mother? Mother? Mother, have a drink. Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Her internal organs... Throat, lungs, stomach... Everything seems to be in order. But why did my mother cough blood, Doc? Could be a friction with the food. She injured her throat, and she choke. But, Doc, what about this? This thing coming out of my mother's mouth? It is possible that your mother is going through some hard times. And sometimes, people act irrationally. I see your mother still can't forget about your father. Are you saying my mother is insane? She's trying to kill herself? What are you doing, Dina? I'm putting your clothes in, I just ironed them. Tomorrow you go to school with your brother. But, Mother... No buts. This is the same piece of glass that came out of Mother. And this one came out of Father, the one Mother has been hiding. Din, you like to read detective stories, don't you? That doesn't make you a detective. The same thing that happened to Father is happening to Mother. But Mother still survive. Mother knew something was wrong with Father's death. That's why she's behaving strange. What's wrong with our family? This is not a common disease, Brother. But you heard what the doctor said, didn't you? Even the doctor can't explain why a piece of glass came out of Mother! I don't believe in this kind of things! If we don't trust the doctor, who should we trust? Then when will you start believing? When Mother die? Return all these to Mother's room now. Before she finds out. I'll think about what we should do. It has been 20 years. Now you come back to me. What happened, Sri? Something strange is happening to me. Nothing strange. For such an attractive woman like you, Sri. Don't be offended. It's the truth. Everybody wants to look perfect. Always envy... other people who are perfect. Your hand. A hex. Who did it? It needs to be removed immediately. This kind of things, cannot be taken lightly. Removed? The person now... wants you dead, slowly. Return it. What is it, Num? Ma'am? Come inside, Num. Have some porridge, Ma'am. You just get some rest. Let me do the housework. Jarwo. Is she the one? Jarwo! Mother? What happened, Mother? Please tell me. You get some rest, alright. Eh? How's Mother? She came home crying. Her dress was torn, there were blood all over her face, her dress. I asked where she was, but she wouldn't answer. I'm scared, Brother. What is this? I suspect that someone put a curse on Mother. What's with you, believing in things like that? Brother! Listen to me! We should've taken Mother to... To where, Din? To where? To that shaman Jarwo, is that it? To that shaman Jarwo? Let me tell you. Jarwo is dead, Din. His house was burned down. What's wrong with you? Thank you, for staying with my mother. It's okay. If you need anything, just let me know. Get rid of him! Get rid of him! Calm down! I understand your worries, I understand very well. But let us all think with a clear mind. Jarwo here, he hasn't been buried for more than a day. That is sinful! Our sins! Hey, Chief. That shaman, when he was alive... he committed nothing but sins. Now that he's dead, you want us to share his sins? We, the villagers, refuse to have that heretic... buried in our village. Sacrilege! Chief. His corpse, smells so foul. Calm down. / Chief. He was a practitioner of witchcraft. He worshipped the devil! Despite our belief in this village... even if we bury him, the Earth won't accept his body. He will rise again! So you want Jarwo's corpse to be left out here? Is that it? Bury him away in the forest! Bury him! Sir. I Yes, Miss? / You know this address? I'm sorry, I don't know. Sir, do you know this address? Ma'am? She took my husband from me! Are you alright? She must die! Finish her! I'm thirsty. Sorry for bothering you. I'm looking for my mother's friend. Does she live here? Here? Sir, Sir! My mother is sick, she's desperate to see her friend. Child. About 20 years ago... the owner of this house was chased away by the villagers. Why chased away, Grandma? During that time... any trouble were surely related to values and morality. Do you know who owned this house? Her name was Laila. Do you know where she went? Grandma? Please. I really need your help. Under the night light. I search for things out of my sight. Trashed by reality that murdered me. I see your mother still can't forget about your father. Inside my soul. I dream about you whole. I see your mother still can't forget about your father. What are you waiting for, Sri? Painful dignity that long to end. Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Jarwo. Jarwo. Jarwo. He worshipped the devil! Even if we bury him, the Earth won't accept his body. He will rise again! I leave Mother to you, okay? Yeah. Hello? My name is Rina, Ma'am. I got your number from the house at Terusan Agam. I'd like to ask about renting your house, Ma'am. Who am I speaking... Why are the windows barred, Ma'am? Hey! Hey! Ma'am! Wait! Hey! Wait! Wait, Ma'am! I just need to ask something, alright? Where did they bury the shaman? My mother is being disturbed. Jarwo died because of your mother! My mother needs his help now, Ma'am. I need Jarwo to stop haunting my mother. You're insane. He's dead. Where is the tomb, Ma'am? Go find it yourself. In the forest. God! Mother. Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! No. Don't. No. Don't! It's your karma, Sri. Do it now. Mother? Num, where's Mother? In her room. Mother? Mother, open up! It's Andi! What is it, Ndi? / Mother! Mother, open up! Andi, Dina is... What's wrong, Ndi? Do it now! Mother! Mother! Where is she, Ndi? What is happening to my family? It's better that you stay away from this house for a while. It's too horrifying here. You can stay at my house. But I can't leave this house without Mother. We take Dina to my house first. While we search for your mother. Ma? You're home so late, Num. Come in, come in. / Excuse me, Ma'am. I Yes. We'll take Dina to the hospital tomorrow, alright? You should eat, don't get sick as well. Yes, thanks. Here, the soup is ready. Let's eat. Come, Andi, Don't be shy. Yes, Ma'am. Thanks, Mother. Andi, are you sure, you're not reporting this to the police? I don't know, Ma'am. I'm not sure what to say to the police. I'm sorry. Oh, it's fine. I understand that these kind of things are outside human common sense. But I know people nowadays, with their hubris. Arrogant, denying the existence of the supernatural. Andi? Andi? Huh? What? What's wrong? RATNA CATERING Din. Din. Din. Din. RATNA is LEILA!! RATNA CATERING Hanum? Hanum? Eh, Andi. What's wrong? Ndi, what's wrong? Num, Num. Num, listen to me. I have to take Dina out of here right now. Huh? Why? Num. I What's wrong with Dina? / I need to go now, Okay? Okay? Num, please listen to me. You have to trust me, okay? Fine, let me ask my mom first, okay? / No, don't. No. Huh? What's going on, Ndi? Just follow my words, okay? It's locked. The key's not here. You have a spare key? Just a second. Okay. Num? Hurry, Num. There was once a story. Of a single stalk of rose. Where are you going this late? Filled with treacherous thorns. Hanum, come. Where are you going? No, I wasn't going anywhere, Ma. Hanum. Hey! Where's my mother, Laila? What are you two doing? What did you do to my sister? Where's my mother? What did you do to my mother? Laila, what did my mother do to you, huh? Dear. You think your mother is such a sweet woman? Huh? You don't know what she had done to me. To my family. I was in my early pregnancy. I threw away all my dignity to see your mother... because she was my best friend. I only asked what was rightfully mine. Her love for Herman had blinded her. Your mother took Herman from me. And you know what? That time, a pregnant woman without a husband... was considered despicable and a damnation in this village! Those hypocrites chased me away from this village! They considered me lower... than that cursed shaman Jarwo! The one who helped your mother put a spell on my Herman! And Hanum? Hanum is Herman's child. Your father's daughter. Isn't she beautiful? So all this time you... Yes, Honey. You have foolishly... placed your beloved mother under my care. Allowing me to freely do anything. To make her suffer. But why do you have to hurt Dina? Dina is smarter than you. She almost uncovered all of my secrets. You witches! What did you do to my sister, huh? Where's my mother, Laila? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother. Andi? Dina? Sri... You're at my house now. Laila? You still remember me? And this is Hanum, my daughter. How are you, Ma'am? Would you like to eat? Or do you need me to feed you? It's a shame that Herman is dead, right? He can't see his whole family gathering right now. Hanum... Please release my children. Don't do it, Laila! Not my daughter! Don't hurt my sister, Num. Brother? Mother? Dina! Stop it! You witch! Stop it! Laila, stop it! Please don't, Laila! No! Don't! Don't hurt my sister! Don't hurt my sister! Don't hurt my sister! You witch! Dear, the pain she suffers... is nothing compared to the suffering that my daughter and I endure all these times. Dina! Dina. I'm sorry. Stop it, Laila! Let go of my children! Stop torturing her! I'm sorry, Laila! I'm truly sorry! It's too late, Sri. In fact, it's your turn now. Soon you can go along with that cursed shaman to his grave. And you will enjoy being buried alive. But let my children go. You can no longer order me around. Now I'm in charge. Isn't that so dear? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? Mother? My dear Andi. There's no need to look so glum. Dear, are you alright? Get up, Child! Mother? Andi, no! What's wrong with this thing? You wait here, okay? Bring Mother home. Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother! Mother!
