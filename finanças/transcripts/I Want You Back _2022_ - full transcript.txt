I feel like, whatever it is, you can just tell me. Uh, it's gonna be weird to go back to the party. - You're crying. - I want to break up with you. What?! Don't we have a really good time together? We do. It's just not enough. I… I'm ready for the next chapter in my life, and… You're still figuring a lot out. Like what? Your roommates are college students. Okay. But they're very mature people. And they're prelaw. They're practically lawyers. You also don't even know what you want to do with your life. I… I think I'm just kind of, like, doing it. (chuckles) 29 is the new 16. You're 32. Yeah, I mean, if you want to be, like, a scientist about it, I'm 32. Look, I met someone. (sighs) Why didn't you just say that instead of making me eat your steak? I mean, this just makes no sense. It's completely out of nowhere. ANNE: Oh, no, it's not. I have been unhappy for a while, Peter. Really? You have? I mean… - Yes. Yes. - You never said anything. We're stuck. No, what-what do we do? We go to work and we make salmon and we watch Dancing with the Stars. Oh, come on. I… We do stuff. We went to Wind Creek Casino to see Rod Stewart. Okay. I was never supposed to be an English teacher, Peter. My sense memory professor said I could've been the next Kate Winslet. - You still could be. - Not with you. - (sighs) God. - Oh, Peter, that's not... I didn't… I mean, that is a really specific and hurtful thing to say. - Not with me? - I'm sorry, but it's true. Okay. You're very… Complacent, and it makes me complacent. And I really wanted a big life. Yeah, I wanted to study commedia dell'arte in Florence, and I wanted to do Shakespeare at the Globe in London. (Peter sighs) Six years and we've never even been out of the country together. - But we did go see… - Don't say Rod Stewart. So, this new girl, is she, like, really together or something? I-I guess so. I mean, she has this little pie shop down the street from my gym and… Cute. I don't know why that matters. (clears throat) What? ANNE: I'm sorry, Peter. You are the last person in the world I want to hurt. I should… I should probably get back downstairs. Well, do you mind if I stick around long enough to sing "Happy Birthday" to Toby?

We could stop offering ice. How would their drinks be cold? They wouldn't. Okay. I like it. I think we need something bigger. Who else has something? We could replace our real chicken with a much cheaper new product called Hint of Chicken. RITA: (chuckles) What the hell is Hint of Chicken? MATT: The name's pretty self-explanatory, ma'am. RITA: Can you liquefy it and sip it through a straw? - MATT: Yes, ma'am. - You can gum it? MATT: No teeth required. - RITA: Is it a protein? - It's protein adjacent.

Uh… excuse me for one second. I j... I'm sorry, I j... I just get really upset when I-I think about how much money we're-we're spending on feeding old people, all right?

Well, back when I was the fire marshal, I would've said that that's not allowed. - (chuckles softly) - No, but yeah. Okay. Here you go. (inhales sharply) Yeah. (coughing) Oh, my God.

(sobbing) I'm sorry I just said that. I probably shouldn't have said that. It's cool. Everyone loves pie. Pie's actually not that great.

Sorry about that. Movie's, like, 25 years old. I didn't think I could spoil it. I'm not sad because of the movie. I'm sad because Noah was my airplane safety mask person. Your what? (sighs) My airplane safety mask person. - What is that? - (sighs) Have you ever been on an airplane and they play that video that says, "Please secure your own oxygen mask before helping others"? Yeah, that's every airplane I've been on. Well, I remember, when I was little, thinking that, if I were ever really in love - and I was on an airplane with my lover… - Hmm. …that I would put his mask on before my own. When you were little, you used the word "lover" in your thoughts? (both laugh quietly) Well, that's not the point. - Well, it's kind of ridiculous… - No. …because you always put your own mask on first. No, you don't. You're actually more helpful to others once you're getting a steady flow of oxygen to your brain. - Oh, that's just… - It's just logical, right? You're actually putting your "lover" - at greater risk… - Why did you do that? - Would you two shut the fuck up? - …by not putting on your mask. Sorry. (whispering): By not putting your own mask on first, so… No, but it's not about that. - It's about romance. - I don't mean for it not… - It would be immediate that I can't… - (laughs) - It's all true. - Yeah. - All right. (sighs) - (sighs) You want to have lunch tomorrow? Uh, yeah. Yeah, that sounds nice. Let's do it. - Okay. - All right. See ya. - Bye. - Bye. This is what I need. I just need to see what's happening with him, and then… - All right, let's just do it, right? - Yeah. Let's just rip off the Band-Aid and look. - Let's just do it. Let's just do it. - You got it. Okay, here we go. Oh, my God. Oh, no. - EMMA: Jesus, this is, this is bad. - Why? This pie girl is really pretty. Look at her muffins. She looks like she's really good at her job. And look at her with my boyfriend. They look so happy. Hey, guys. I just wanted to show you these pies I made for Chrissy Teigen and John Legend's anniversary party.

Oh, you're a human man? - Wow. - Dude, that's awesome. What's that like? I bet he's a chill hang. "Come help paint sets for Andrews Middle School production - of Little Shop of Horrors." - Oh. Is he 14? Andrews Middle School, that's… that's Anne's school. So… so this guy is the drama teacher at her school? Really? Really? This is her living a-a big life? Leaving me for a middle school drama teacher? Ooh, she commented on this picture of him drinking coffee. What'd she say? Ugh, you don't want to know. I think I do want to know. What did... what did she write? He's just drinking coffee and it's, like… - Well… - …that kind of content. - See, I feel like you're trying to protect me. - I am. But that's actually... It's making it worse. - Now I have to know what she says. - No, you don't. - Come on. Let me... Can I… - It's just, like, not... It's not. - It's not. It doesn't matter. - May… - I don't... It's a... Okay. - Come on. (sighs) She wrote kissy face, kissy face, coffee cup. Yeah, it's, like, stupid. Oh, and he wrote, "I miss you. Come back to bed." (smacks lips) - Wow, I… - I'm sorry.

I'm never gonna find a man as kind and good as Noah. Yeah. He was the love of my life. A-Anne is the love of mine. And I feel like I'm still the love of hers. You know? We can't give up. We have to get them back. (sighs) What? It's just like you said. - We know that we're supposed to be with Noah and Anne. - Mm. But I'm not so sure that they're gonna realize it, not with these shiny new people around. So what are we supposed to do? We have to… (scoffs) We have to break them up. (laughs) Well, that's crazy. We can't do that. How would we do that? PETER: What if we follow Ginny around, right? And-and we discover all her dirty little secrets, and then we slip them to Noah in, like, an unmarked envelope or something. What if she doesn't have any? Then we create some, right? Little Photoshop makes it look like Ginny does fracking. Oh, I would never date someone if they did fracking. Right? Yeah, no, me neither. - What is fracking? - I don't know, actually. ♪ ♪ I could tell Noah that I'm pregnant with his baby. All right. How's that help me? You tell Anne she's pregnant with your baby. PETER: All right, what if we do this? All right, hear me out. We send Noah a note from Ginny that says, "Meet me at my grandmother's cabin for a weekend of fishing, maybe a little bit of fun." But when he gets there, you are there, -and you're lying naked on a bearskin rug… -Oh. …and you say, "I knew you'd come." What? But he didn't know what he was coming to. Mm, yeah, but it doesn't matter, right? Because you seduce him very quickly before he has a chance to get back to his car. Which I guess would be pretty quick. Okay, all right, you know, we'll file this one under "work in progress." Well, there is something there. There is something there, right? To the cabin. No, the cabin is nothing. I could seduce Logan. - Whoa. - And then Anne would find out and she would get so upset of course, and she would dump him because she would be like, "Whoa, I miss my ex-boyfriend." - Me. - "He was so nice and sweet, and we had six years and he never cheated on me once." No, that's true. I never did. And don't think I didn't have my chances, you know? - I don't. - My dry cleaner was super into me, - um, until she died of natural causes. - Uh… But, um, do you really think you can seduce Logan? I mean, I don't want to brag, but, um, in high school, (chuckles) I once kissed my married gym teacher. And his wife was really hot, so… Oh, no. And it was, like, a whole thing. Um, let's move past that. All right, and then I could, too... I could steal Ginny away from Noah. (laughs) Wh… Why are you laughing? I'm not... I don't think I was laughing. I… You don't, you don't think I could do it? I... Have you seen Noah, what he's like and everything? - Yes. - Oh, okay. I mean, yeah, he's a classically handsome guy, but I-I, uh, I, uh, I offer a lot. I think that you are somebody that a person could fall very deeply in love with. Thank you? - But it's more like slowly. - Mm-hmm. Over five or six months. Okay. Or like a year. Two years tops. Do you realize the number's going up? Okay, I don't think that you can get to Ginny. You've made that perfectly clear. But I do think that you could become Noah's friend. I could do that. I mean, people like to be my friend. I'm extremely affable. You know, in college, all the girls were like, "You're such a good friend." Aw, darn it. But-but-but the point is people like to be my friend. - Right. - I get in his head. You... that's exactly right. You get in his head, and then you make him realize that Ginny isn't that great. - She's not that great. - Yeah. And that I am the one that got away. Hey, do you really think we can do this? - Yes, I do. - I'm in if you're in. I will seduce Logan, you will friendship seduce Noah, - and we will win back our people. - All right. It's on. Mm!

Solo, single. Oh, my goodness, what are you looking at? Whose mom are you? - Nobody's. - Then why are you here? You some kind of pervert? No, I'm not. I'm here because I love musical theater, okay? Why are you here, narc? Work detention. Ooh. What did you do? I put the class gerbil in a blender. - Oh, my God! - Not really. - (groans) - Skipped science for a week. And they're making you do this plant thing? Ooh, the education system in this country is a hot mess. Woo-hoo! All my Skid Rowers. - Come get hats and scarves. - BOY: Nice. - (fingers snapping) - ANNE: There's plenty for everyone. - (whispering): Hey. - All right, slow down. Slow down. What's the deal with her? That's Miss Rivera. She teaches English. She does the costumes for the play 'cause she's banging Mr. Santos. Oh, how do you know that? Uh, Trevor, don't skimp on the glue, please. Thank you. Yeah, Trevor, don't skimp on the glue. I got to take five. (clears throat) - Hey, Logan. - LOGAN: Yes? Am I doing this right? Because I just feel like it's so wet. LOGAN: I-I think if you just take your two fingers… - Like... yeah. Okay. - Yes, just like that. - Yeah, you can... okay. - And then we'll just let it drip out. - Oh, thank you. - Let it drip, yeah. - Just-just... yeah. - I don't think we've met. Hi. - Oh. (laughs) - Oh. (laughs) Emma, this is Anne. She's one of our English teachers here and our costume mistress and the mistress of my heart. - Uh… (chuckles) - (laughs) This is Emma. She came to help even though she doesn't have a kid here. Isn't that cool? - It's definitely something. (chuckles) - Right? But, I mean, who wouldn't want to help at a school musical? So fun. Fun? (chuckles) It's more than just fun. - Well, I was… - You know, it's actually really impactful, I would say. It's serious. You are exposing these young minds to the power of theater. Yeah, that's what I meant. You know how serious I take this production. Yes, sorry. You're right, you're right. I'm-I'm a, I'm a little tense. Maybe I should've just done The Music Man like everyone said. Stop it. I love that you're pushing the envelope. Maybe we can open a bottle of Barolo and talk about it tonight. - (whispers): I'd love that. - (whispers): Okay. (Logan exhales) They seemed really into each other but kind of in that way that's like, "These people also might murder each other." - Oh, really? - Yeah. So I volunteered for a bunch more rehearsals. I really think I can break them up in, like, no time. Ah, nice. So what's he like? - Logan… Logan's a lot. - Really? It's like, um, "You're actually directing a middle school play, sir…" (chuckles) - Yeah. (groans) - "…not a production of, like…" Can't think of a fancy play? Is the movie Titanic based on a play? - Mm, it's based on a ship. - Yeah, I don't, uh… Tell me about Noah. Right. Um… Well, I see why you like him. I mean, the guy looks like a superhero. Uh, he's charming, he's, um… - I know all of this about him. - (chuckles) That's why I'm trying to, like… - These are all things you know, huh? Um… - Yeah, I just want to know, like, did he say that he missed me or something like that? You know what he said? He said that no one has ever made him laugh like you did. - Ugh. - No, in a very positive way. - Like… - Funny girl. - I would focus on the good. - LISA: (moans) Oh, my God! (Paul and Lisa moaning) - Oh, my God, that feels so good! - (Paul grunting) - Okay, don't be alarmed… - I'm not. …but I believe there are people having sex in your apartment. - Yeah, I share that belief. - What is that? - (laughs): It's my roommates. - What are you talking about? - You live with a couple? - Yes, I do. I live with a couple of broke college students who are in love, and I can't pay for this whole place myself, so… You ever think about getting a smaller place, you know? - Something just for you? - Yeah, sometimes. - (Lisa moaning) - PAUL: It's like we're the only people - in the world right now. - LISA: Oh, you are. I did not mean to live here so long. I moved in my sophomore year of college. - I was gonna move out on graduation. - Okay. - And then my dad got sick again, and… - Oh. So I took the semester off to kind of, like… I'm sorry, I-I didn't know your dad is sick. Uh, he was sick. He had cancer for most of my life. PAUL (moans): Oh, that feels so good. And then he died. - Oh, my God. - PAUL: Oh, my God! - Here it comes! Here comes my love! - (Lisa moans) - Where do you want my love?! - LISA: Oh, my God, everywhere! (Paul moaning loudly) - PAUL (sobbing): My God! - (Lisa moaning) That sounded like the finale. - Yeah. - And so what happened then? Y-You never wanted to go back and finish school? Yeah, I did. I just thought I would figure out what I wanted to do with my life, (chuckles): and then I guess I never did. (door opens) - (Lisa laughing) - Oh. - Oh, whoa. I didn't know you guys were home. - Oh. Didn't know we had an audience. I didn't hear a thing. Did you hear anything? - For... when? - I didn't hear a thing, guys, so you're-you're good. EMMA: Just out here chomping chips.

My dad was supposed to pick me up, but he probably forgot. Oh. Bummer. Uh… I can give you a ride home. Okay. But just to be clear, I'm a safe person. Normally, you shouldn't get in a car with any, like, random adult, especially if they tell you that they're safe. That's usually a sign that they're not safe at all. I mean, the first time I went to a boy-girl sleepover, it was at my friend Sarah's house. And this boy Jonathan brought all these videos, and they played the scariest movie, and then I had to call my mom and tell her she forgot to take me to the orthodontist, but it was like 9:30 p.m. at night. What are you doing? Want a cig? No, I don't want a cig. And why do you even have cigs? Aren't you like nine years old? No, I'm in seventh grade. I'm 12. Are you stupid? Okay. You know what? I get that being a kid is hard. I really do get that. You're greasy, you're horny… I'm not greasy. You're greasy. Ah-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba. Let me just tell you, I don't know you well, but I feel like your whole "I'm over the world" attitude is maybe a little bit more than just normal tween angst. What's up? My dad is having an affair. Oh. With a research librarian named Bruce. Okay, so let me guess. The dumb-ass kids in your class are making fun of you for having a gay dad. - No, my dad's always been gay. - Oh, yeah. - He cheated on my other dad. - Of course. He keeps trying to have these deep talks with me about it, but I'm just like, "Fuck you, Dad. - Why don't you go do blowjobs on Bruce." - Oh. Okay, well, first of all, you don't do blowjobs. (stammers) No. (sighs) Being in love is-is very complicated, and if your dad really does love this man Bruce, then… You wouldn't get it. Your dad probably loves having sex with your mom. Mm… well, my dad's dead, so he doesn't really have much sex with anyone these days. Except for angels maybe. If he's lucky. - I'm sorry. - It's okay. Can I tell you a little secret about being an adult? We're all just pretending that we know what we're doing, and we're hoping that we don't screw it up too badly, and then we're feeling really shitty about ourselves when we do.

He can totally hook us up, bottle service. - Oh, so it's like a club? Like a… - Yeah. Oh, that'd be nice. I haven't been to a club in, uh, ever? I've had a couple wild nights there myself. Uh, who would do that, like, you and your ex or, like, uh… Yeah, we've shut it down. - You guys had some good times. Cool, mm. - Uh-huh. - Mm! Babe. - Yeah?

So I guess I'm gonna be a club guy now. You know, for a scummy nightclub, that place is actually shockingly fun. - Yeah? - Oh, yeah. We used to be, like, the last two people on the dance floor. Oh, you know what's funny? He said something just like that. Yeah, that you supposedly, y-you guys would shut it down or something like that. - He did? - Yeah. And I think this could work, you know? This is probably, like... it's just what he needs to make him realize how much he misses you.

I got… I got a master's degree in public health, and I was gonna revolutionize the way this country treats their elderly, but, you know, instead I took the first job I was offered, and… And I just stayed because I was too chickenshit to lose my cushy salary and my good benefits. Mm. Sorry, hold on. Your life dream was to revolutionize the way that we treat old people? I mean, both my parents worked all the time, and they'd stick me in my grandmother's retirement home most days after school. And we had fun, but it was sad in there. You know? It was this ugly, weird-smelling building where all these old people with incredible stories and so much wisdom, you know, they eat terrible food, they watch bad movies on basic cable, and they wait to die. - Oh, Jesus. - I know, yeah. So I decided one day I would open my own retirement home. Eh, some place that was, like, affordable and cozy but somewhere where you would actually like to wake up every day. That is so sweet and so weird. Okay, I can't tell if you're making fun of me. - I'm not. - (chuckles): Okay. I like it. I-I love your dream. Only I didn't do it, you know? And I became a part of the problem. Anne was right, you know? I… I am stuck. It's no wonder she broke up with me. Peter, stop. Stop it. - You're a total catch. - Yeah?
