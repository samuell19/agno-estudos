Lentelefilm The Fabulous Journey Of Bilbo Baggins, The Hobbit Accross the wild land, through the dark forest, and beyond the misty mountains. There and back again. After the fantastic novel by John Tolkien, "The Hobbit". Translated by N. Rahmanova In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, no! It was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort. There is little or no magic about hobbits. They dress in bright colours. They wear no shoes, because their feet grow natural leathery soles. They have a good-natured faces. They are laugh often. Especially after dinner, which they have twice a day. When they can get it. Our hobbit, Bilbo Baggins, was convinced that no adventure would ever happened to him, and he never did anything unexpected. But I will tell you a story of how he had an adventure, and to his surprise, began to do and say the unexpected. One day on a quiet, early morning, in those days, when there was less noise in the world, and more green, Bilbo Baggins was standing at his door after breakfast, smoking a wooden pipe. Good morning. What do you mean? Do you wish me a good morning, or mean that it is a good morning whether I want not? Or that it is a morning to be good on for all? All of them at once. And a very fine morning to sit outside with a smoke. Let's smoke a pipe together. Sit down, there?s no hurry, we have all the day before us. Please. Very pretty. But I have no time today. I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure that I am arranging. But it's not easy to find anyone. Ho-ho-ho-ho! In our parts? Ha-ha. We are hobbits, and we're plain quiet folk. We have no love for adventures. Nothing but trouble. And discomfort. If you're looking for participants, search them accross The River, or over The Hill. Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha! Good morning. What a lot of things you do use good morning for. Ai-ai-ai-ai-ai...Now you mean that you want to get rid of me? Not at all, my dear sir. Unfortunately, I have not the honour to know your name. You have it, my dear sir. And I do know your name, mr. Bilbo Baggins. And you do know my name, though you don?t remember that I belong to it. I am Gandalf, and Gandalf means me. How? You are a Gendalf? Imagine that. Oh, are you really the one? Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha... The wandering wizard responsible for so many quiet lads and lasses going off into no one knows where, for quest of adventure. I beg your pardon, but I had no idea you were still in business. Where else should I be? My mother Belladonna, she told me lots of your stories, about goblins and giants and the rescue of princesses. All the same I am pleased to find you remember something about me. It means you are not completely hopeless. And for the sake of you mother, I will give you what you asked for. I beg your pardon, sir, I have not asked you for anything! No, twice now, you asked me for my pardon. I give it you. Aaah... thank you. I will go so far as to send you on my adventure. Very amusing for me, and profitable for you. Ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha... Thank you, mr. Gendalf, but I don't want it. Yes. Sorry, but some other time. Other...Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha... But, of course, please come to me, any time you like. Tomorrow, for example. We'll drink a cup of tea. But sorry, not today. Bilbo scuttled inside his hole. Let's agree, after this exhilarating conversation he should to fortify himself immediately, with a cake or two and a drink of something strong. Next day, just before Bilbo was going to take tea, there came a tremendous ring on the front-door bell. Dwalin, at your service. Good day. Aaa... good day... Bilbo Baggins, at yours. I am just about to take tea. Will you join to me? Please. I see they have begun to arrive already. Balin at your service. Bilbo Baggins, at yours. Don't you wish tea? A little beer would suit me better, if you have it. But I don?t mind a plum-cake, if it doesn't inconvenience you. Not at all. Kili at your service. And Fili too. Bilbo Baggins, at yours. Balin and Dwalin are already here, as I see. Yes. So, let's join to the throng. Please. Very glad. Someone else... I'm sorry. More than one, I should say by the sound. Dori. Bilbo Baggins. Nori. B-Bilbo Baggins. Ori. Bilbo Baggins. Oin. Bilbo Baggins. Gloin. Bilbo Baggins. Sit down... It is not like you, Bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the mat, no? Let me introduce... Bifur. Bilbo Baggins. Bofur. Bilbo Baggins. Bombur. Bilbo Baggins. And, especially, Thorin. B-B-Bilbo Baggins. Here you are. So, now we are all here. I hope there is something left for the late-comers to eat? Of course! - What?s that? - This is tea. - Tea? - Yes. Thank you very much. No tea. For me, I think a tankard of ale. Also, gooseberry jam and apple-tart would be good! Meat pies! Cabbage pie! More cupcakes! And pudding. A cup of coffee, please. Two cups! And please, grab the cold chicken. Pickled cucumbers! Of course!... I hope they eat and drink themselves to death, these dwarves... Coming! Less than half an hour later, all the larders in Bilbo's house were empty. And then cheerfully twenty-six hands helped the hobbit to wash the dishes. Crack the plates! Crack the plates! Chip the glasses! Chip the glasses! Bend the forks! Bend the forks! Blunt the knives! Smash the bottles! Smash the bottles! Burn the cloth! Burn the cloth! Just give us the order! Tear to pieces! Tear to pieces! Tablecloths! Tablecloths! Spill on the chairs, spill on the chairs, fat from the cutlet! Peel and bones! Peel and bones! Drop at your feet! Drop at your feet! Smear the mustard over the floor! Cups and glasses! Cups and glasses! In a boiling bowl! In a boiling bowl! Stir it with an iron bar! Stir it with an iron bar! Take them out! Take them out! Dry them off! Dry them off! Then throw them away! Then throw them all away! Who is sitting by idle? Let's take care of the fine china! Meanwhile, the evening fell. In the black sky, over the trees, the stars were scattered. They sat by the fireplace and smoked their pipes. Gandalf. Dwarves. Mr. Baggins. We are met in the house of our friend and fellow conspirator, an excellent and audacious hobbit, in order to discuss our plans. Our object is, I suppose, well known to all of us. But perhaps, for mr. Baggins - may the hair never fall from his feet - and some younger dwarves... I think I should be right in naming Fili and Kili, the situation may require some explanation. So, I explain. Very soon, before dawn, we will go on a long journey, on a dangerous journey, and many of us, probably all, except for our friend and advisor, the ingenious wizard Gandalf, I repeat... Maybe none of us will return from this journey. Easily excitable person! Prone to unexplained bouts. But one of the best! Fierce as a dragon with its tail in the door. Do you think, he will do? It's all very well for Gandalf to talk about this hobbit being fierce. He fainted from fear! In fact, if I hadn't seen the magic sign on the door, then I would have thought that we had come to the wrong place. And I immediately understood that something was wrong. He looks more like a grocer than a burglar! Pardon! Like a gro... Like a grocer? Like a grocer. Like a grocer?! Well, I will prove to you! I will prove you of what I am capable! Like a grocer... As soon as I saw your, pardon me, unsympathetic faces, it seemed to me that you had come to the wrong place. But continue as if you came to the right place! Like a grocer! Speak! Tell me what I must to do, and I will do it. I'll do all of what I am capable, whoever I will have to fight. So there. I will not, I will not pretend, that I understand what this is about. I don't. I especially do not understand the last statement about burglars. Well here's what. I have chosen mr. Baggins, and that should be enough. And if I say he is a burglar, well then a burglar he is. Or he will be a burglar... when the time comes. Note that to enter into the Mountain's secret passage you will need burglary! Mr. Baggins is not as simple as you think. Yes yes! And he is not as simple as he thinks. A time may come, when you may have to thank me for him! If, of course, you survive. Pull yourself together, Baggins. It is time to discuss the journey. This map was made by Thror, your grandfather, Thorin. He was a King under the Mountain. In those days dwarfs owned all of the Mountain's treasures, and lived in peace and friendship with the people of Lake Town. But a terrible cruel dragon named Smaug burned everything down! He stole the treasure of the dwarves and since that time he lives there now, by spreading fear and collecting cruel tribute from the people of Lake-town. But we, dwarves, never forgot the treasures stolen from us. And especially, a diamond called the Arkenstone. The Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain! And we still are determined to get back the treasure! Get it back! And to avenge us on the dragon Smaug, if we can. To the way! To the way! To the way! To the way! And they sang a mysterious dwarf song to accompany them during the journey. And the hobbit wanted to see the great mountains, to listen to the sound of waterfalls and of pines, to explore the caves, to wear a sword instead of cane. And yet he urged himself: ?Don?t be a fool, Bilbo! Thinking of dragons and all that outlandish nonsense at your age! But sense for adventure inevitably captured the poor hobbit, mr. Bilbo Baggins. # Far over the misty mountains cold # To dungeons deep and caverns old # We must away ere break of day # To seek the pale enchancted gold # The dwarves of yore made mighty spells # White hammers fell like ringing bells # Diamonds, rubies, and sapphire # Dwarfs put them in twisted wire # The bells were ringing in the dale # And men looked up with faces pale # A dragon's ire, more fierce than fire # Laid low their town and houses frail # The mountain smoked beneath the moon # The dwarves heard the tramp of doom # They fled their hall to dying fall # Beneath his feet, beneath the moon # Far over the misty mountains grim # To dungeons deep and caverns dim # We must away ere break of day # To win our harps and gold from him! They left behind many days and many miles. The track they were taking became hard, and the path was long and dangerous. One night they were high in the mountains, on a narrow platform, on the edge of a dizzying cliff that was steeply going down. A storm began. You know, how terrible lightning and thunder can rage in the mountains, at night, when two thunderstorms meet and clash against each other. It is... It is very dangerous to stay here! If we are not blown away by the wind and not washed away by the rain, then a giant may grab anyone of us, and kick us sky-high like a football! If you know a better place, then take us there. We must send someone to find a more comfortable shelter! - Will you go? - I'm tired and may fall down. And I'm afraid, I'm afraid of falling into the abyss. - We must send the youngest of us! - That's right! - And of course we're always the ones. - And what did we take a hobbit for? What for? It's his duty, let him go exploring! - I'm new to these mountains. - All right, enough of bickering! Fili, Kili, go search, until you are struck by lightning! There is nothing like looking when you want to find something! Onwards! No doubt. You usually find something when you are looking, but not necessarily the thing you were looking for. And so it happened this time. That is the danger of caves, you never know what lies in wait for you inside. And then, the whole company, enjoying the warmth, quickly fell asleep... Only Bilbo turned from side to side. He had a hideous dream. A pack of wolves, from which they barely escaped, shaggy trolls, that by a miracle didn't eat them for dinner, and from whom they grabbed a magic sword, and how high in the sky eagles carried them to safety. And then he had a dream that the cave cracked, and that ugly goblins fell from this crack. Bilbo cried, woke up, and immediately realized, that it was not a dream... Clap! Snap! The black crack! Grib, grab! Pinch, nab! And down down to goblin-town You go, my lad! Clash, crash! Cursh, smash! Hammer and tongs! Knocker and gongs! Pound, pound, far underground! Ho ho, my lad! Swish, smack! Whip crack! Batter and beat! Yammer and bleat! Work, work! Nor dare to shirk! While goblins quaff and goblins laugh Round and round far underground Below, my lad! Who are these pitiful persons?! Dwarves, and this one! They were hiding in our front porch! Why on earth? I'm sure they are up to some dirty trick! Spying on my people! I wouldn't be surprised if they were thieves, or worse - murderers and friends of elves! Well, what do you have to say? I am... I am Thorin the dwarf. We cannot be blamed for those things of which you suspect us. We sheltered in a convenient cave that we thought was empty. We hid from the storm, and we didn't intend to disturb goblins in any way! What were you doing in the mountains at all?! Who are you, are where are you going?! We are... I want to know all about you! I already know a lot about your plans, so let's have the truth! We are the dwarves... And I'm...and I'm..and I'm a hobbit. We wanted to visit our relatives who live to the east of these mountains. He's lying, oh greatest of the great. He had better explain how he got the sword from the trolls' lair! Goblin-murderers! And elf-friends! Whip them! Chop them! Bite them! Nibble them! Throw them into a snake pit! Make them never see the daylight anymore! Faster! Faster! They relight the torches again! Faster! What happened? Why do you jump? My foot. Why-why. I twisted it. Get up, the goblins are there. Thorin! Everyone here? One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven... Where are Fili and Kili? Fili, Kili! Here they are. Twelve, thirteen, and Bilbo Baggins is fourteen. Well, not bad, it could be worse... Could be better. In fact, we're scared stiff! And we have no hope for food. Not even a small raisin-cake... Or a piece of ham and a sip of ale... And why did I leave my cozy hobbit-hole... Why? Why did we take this blunderer to come with us?! And he calls himself a burglar. A burglar! Boaster! Like all hobbits! We don't know where we are. And the angry goblins have caught up with us now! Mr. Bilbo Baggins bumped his head on a stone and lost consciousness. Imagine how scared he was when he came to. Nobody around, and a thick darkness... I personally would not want to be in the place of mr. Bilbo Baggins. By no means. Oh... Oh... Where am I? Where can I go now? Going back is pointless, to the side is silly, and forward.... I have to go forward. Oh, oh... What's this? A ring...interesting. Why is it here? I'd better keep it in my pocket. What's this? Water? It is cold! Well... no flow. So, it's not a river. So, it's a pond, or a puddle... My mother Belladonna many times told me that ponds occur in caves like this, and that fearful fish live in these ponds. With big eyes. Because they all the time keep trying to see in the dark, and so their eyes bulge and bulge... But even his mother Belladonna did not know, that there are more fearful creatures than fish. They settled in the caves before the goblins, and now they lurk in the dark crannies, snooping and spying and smelling about... And right in the place where our hobbit crouched near a lake, there lived an old gollum close to the water. A big slippery creature. I do not know where he came from, nor who or what he was. He was Gollum and that's all. Though he called himself "my precious". Glitter and splash, my precious... Wine and dine! A tasty morsel for us, gollum... Oh. Who are you? And who are you? Me? I am Bilbo Baggins. I have lost the dwarves and I don?t know where I am. And I don?t want to know, if only I can get away. And why do we not to sit down, and talk a little bit, my precious? - To you? - Yes. He like riddles? Perhaps he does? He? He is, me? I like them. But! You ask first. What has roots as nobody sees, Is taller than trees, Up, up it goes, And yet never grows? It is a mountain. You knew it, you knew! Look how easily he guessed. But let's have a competition with us, let's have. If my precious asks, and he doesn?t answer, my precious will eats him. Well, it's clear. And if he asks, and my precious doesn?t answer, then... No, I will not eat you! Of course! Then we do what he wants - we shows him the way out. That's a different matter. And... It's my time to ask a riddle. So... Thirty white horses on a red hill, First they champ, Then they stamp, Then they stand still. Rinky-dink! Teeth, my precious, teeth, he-he-he. But we has only six, here is: one, two, three, four, five, six. Now it's our time to ask a riddle again. Go on. Voiceless it cries, Toothless bites, Wingless flutters, Mouthless mutters. As easy as pie. It is the wind. You knew it again! - Now it's my turn. - Well, tell it... Now you puzzle. He-he-he! No-legs lay on one-leg, two-legs sat near on three-legs, four-legs got some. Uuuuu... hee-hee-hee-hee. This is... Fish on a little table, man at table sitting on a stool. And the cat has the bones. That's the meaning. Well, it's your turn, your turn, come on. It cannot be seen, Cannot be felt, Cannot be heard, Cannot be smelt. It lies behind stars and under hills, And empty holes it fills. It comes first and follows after, Ends life, kills laughter. - The dark. - What? I say that the answer is: The dark. Ha-ha-ha, that's all, my turn. A box without hinges, key, or lid, Yet golden treasure inside is hid. Judging from the sound you are making, the answer's a kettle boiling over, no? Well, let me think about it, let me think... Think, if you are fond of thinking... Well, you know... Sorry. - An egg. - That's right. Your turn. My turn... my turn... Alive without breath, As cold as death, Never thirsty, ever drinking, All in mail never clinking. Nothing can be easier. It is a... This is a... - Well well...you lose... a... It was very hard. You know the answer, or can guess it in the blink of an eye, since you are sitting comfortably at home, and nobody wants to eat you. But Bilbo... Bilbo cleared his throat once or twice, but no answer came... Interesting... Is he tasty? Is he juicy? Is he crunchy? Let me think half a minute, half a minute. I gave you a good long chance, so give me the same. We're waiting... We're waiting... Oh, a fish. It's a fish. So, well... Let him ask again. Fine. So. Listen close... Listen: What have I got in my pocket? Well... It isn't fair! Because it isn?t fair to ask me what this nasty Baggins got in his pocket. Just answer to me: What have I got in my pocket? Well, then give us three guesses. Why the three guesses? - Three. Well, so. Very well, that's a bargain... - A hand! - My hands are here. - Knife!? - Wrong. String, or nothing! Neither one nor the other. Your time is up, the competition is over, you lost. Show me the way out. The competition is over. Come on, show me the way out, that is all. We promised to show nasty Baggins the way out. Maybe. But we are curious, what has he got in his pocket? What has he got in his pocket? Never you mind. A promise is a promise. Yes... But never mind, never mind... My magic ring will help me to eat him. Here it is... Here it is, here it is... Where? It has disappeared... it's gone. It was my birthday-present! Stolen... Stolen... We're miserable, and poor... Is anything wrong? What have you lost? Nothing is lost. And why I ask it? Because I'm lost too and I want to get out. By the way, you lost, so show me the way out. Ah, the riddle was unfair. - What have you lost? - And what's in your pocket? And what's in my pocket? Actually, what's in my pocket? Now let's see. Where'd he go? We guess, it's he who found our magic ring. Found and stole it! Our present! Our birthday-present! Revenge! Revenge! We will find it. We must find and catch this hobbit, take back the ring and eat this nasty hobbit. Hurry to the exit, that way... That way. We must not let him out... the way to the back door. Hey! My precious? Thank you. Now I know where the way to the back door is. Revenge! Revenge! Thief! Thief! Dishounorable thief! He stole, he stole my ring! We hate it, forever we hate it! Hey! My precious! Goodbye! And put on your thinking cap. How poor we are...poor we are...and miserable. He ran and ran. But all the time, he was tormented by a highly unpleasant thought: Whether he should not go back to look for his friends? And when he came to the decision that it was his duty, and felt completely unhappy, suddenly, he heard voices. In the end, he's my friend, and not a bad little chap! I feel responsible for him. I wish you hadn't lost him! We should never have taken him with us in the first place. So far, he's been more trouble than use. I don't care about him! Yes, why didn't you find us someone with more sense! Well here it is: Help me look for him, or I'm gone! Dori came last, and dropped him. He is a bungler! If someone had grabbed your legs from behind in the dark, you'd drop him too! Then why didn?t you pick him up again? Again? Yes. If I had hesitated even for a moment goblins would have torn off my head! We had no time to count one another. He is always disrupting, bad luck to him! Hobbits are no good. That's right. Well, I told you so. Some "burglar"! And here?s the burglar! Why are you so scared? It's me, Bilbo Baggins. Nori, Dori, Kili, Fili... Where you all gone? Who screamed? Whoever screamed, we have a breakfast. It was a hot scramble... But it was worth it! What a tough skins they have... But, for sure, there is good juice inside! Let them hang a bit, it will make them tastier! We must not hang ?em too long, otherwise they'll be all withered! They?re not as fat as they might be... We must kill them now, and then hang them again, what do you think? They are already dead. They are not! I saw one a-struggling just now. It's a sign that he woke up. Come on, check them... You're right. The food is alive... and kicking. Now I will put an end to that. Hey you! Lay off! Hey! O-ho-ho! Old fat spider spinning in a tree! Old fat spider can?t see me! Hey old fool, I'll give you a sign, Drop the cobweb, and try to catch up! Hey you! - Bilbo! - Quickly, free youself and run! - And me? And me? - Run, with all your strength! - Come on, come on. - Thank you, Bilbo! Quickly-quickly-quickly-quickly! And I'll hold them off here. He-he-hey! Spiders are fools! Hee-hee. Here I am, little fly, You are fat and lazy! You can't trap me if you try, In your cobwebs crazy! Here I am. You are lucky. Listen, look. Spider-fools come on, catch me, if you can! You ask what happened then? Listen. Near the Lonely Mountain, on the shore of the lake, stood a town half-burned by a dragon, where the people lived in fear of raids and destruction by a ruthless dragon. Sometimes they used to remember the olden days, when their region was fertile and bountiful, and they lived in peace and harmony with the dwarves, the former owners of the Lonely Mountain. And quietly, so that the dragon would not hear it, they sang songs about the beautiful day when the dwarves would return. I'm Thorin, son of Thrain, King under the Mountain! I have come back! The dwarves have returned! It means the dragon's time is over! The day of reckoning has come. The day of reckoning has come! For the will of the nearby mountains, And caves and streams and rocks, We finally must arise, the young and the old. And on the pure firmament All stars will start to shine, And couplets from the old songs Will sound everywhere! And trees will start to rustle, And herbs will start to sing, And all the light blue rivers Will flow into valleys! They did not have to waste any time. After a brief respite, the dwarves went on to the lair of the dragon. It was the most dangerous part of their journey. The people of the Town saw off Thorin with the most gracious parting words. Meeting with a dragon is no a joke! Who could know how it will all end? Well.. Well, the time has come for the reputable mr. Baggins, who, during our long journey, has proved himself a hobbit who is full of boldness and courage. Right! I would even say, who possesses more good luck than the usual portion, So, I repeat... The time has come for the reputable mr. Baggins to, at last, provide the service for us, for which we took him on this long and dangerous journey, and for which we have promised him a reward. If you expect from me that I'm first to enter into the secret passage, Thorin, son of a Thrain... - Grandson of Thror. May your beard never stop growing... Thank you. ...then, you can say it at once. Of course, I could refuse because I've already saved you, more than once, and already earned some reward. But I'm not want you to think you are dealing with a grocer! Don't say that, mr. Baggins! And to prove to you that I am not a grocer - I will. I agree to enter the secret passage. Well, and... Who will keep me a company? Well, what can I say in defense of the dwarves? What's true is true, dwarves are not heroes, but quite a prudent people who put treasure above all. Some are tricky and treacherous and pretty bad lots. But there are also honest dwarves such as Thorin and the other twelve. Just as long as you don't expect too much from them. Oh... It is the Arkenstone! The Heart of the Mountain! A thief appeared? I can smell you! I hear you breathing. You are welcome... Take... There is a plenty for all... Don't hesitate... Thanks to you, Smaug the Terrible. But I've come, truth be told, not for presents. I came to see if you are really as scary and huge as the stories say. Because I did not seriously believe the fairy tales. And how do I seem to you now? Oh, truly, tales fall short of the reality. My teeth are swords! My claws are spears! The shock of my tail is like a thunderbolt. My wings carry me with the speed of a hurricane. My breath is death! I heard that, generally speaking, dragons are softer underneath. But one so thoroughly protected must have thought of that, or not? Your details are outdated, thief-in-darkness. From above and below I am covered with a strong armour. I'm old and mighty. But of course, I might have guessed it myself. Truly, is there anyone else who could own such a wonderful vest? Hmm, that's right, it is a very rare thing. Yes! Look! What do you say? Awesome! Amazing! Simply inconceivable. (Old fool! Thickhead! You have a hole near the bottom, where the naked body sticks out, like a snail out of shell.) I dare not to detain you any longer with my presence, your magnificence, but at parting I'd like to tell you, that dwarves are not easy to catch. Yes-yes-yes! And burglars too! "Never laugh at live dragons, Bilbo you fool!" - he said to himself, and it became a favourite saying of his later, and passed into a proverb. "This adventure is far from over", he added. And that was pretty true as well. Prepare your arrows, cut the bridges! To arms! Don't waste your time, Bard, and remember: He has a bare patch on the left side of his armour. I saw it with my own eyes. My arrow, fly away and find your target! No more dragon! No more dragon! No more dragon! No more dragon! The treasure, the treasure of the Mountain are ours again! Ours! I would like to remind you about the promised reward, and also, it's proper that we should help the people of the burned Town to rebuild their houses. Nobody has a right! The treasures of the Mountain are all mine! Smaug stole them from my grandfather. Smaug destroyed the Town, and I killed the dragon and so freed your treasure. Is that not a matter that concerns you? We have nothing to talk about! So, but you have forgotten, Thorin, that once you said, that I can take whatever I want on account of the remuneration. Then I... before all... I waive my share, and I transfer this stone to the people of Town. Arkenstone! The Heart of the Mountain! It is mine! It is... it belonged to my father! It is mine! You have a warm heart, hobbit. You pitiful hobbit! You lousy burglar! Damn for Gandalf for imposing you on us, may his beard wither Stop, your wish came true, Gandalf is here. And don't harm the hobbit! You're all in league! No-no-no, Thorin! When you told me I could take a 14th part as my share, I took it literally. Maybe too literally. I just thought that I had been of service. You're not making a good figure as King under the Mountain yet. It is my stone! My stone! Halt! The army of the goblins is upon us! Find a place, while there's time! Get ready for battle! It was a big battle. Arrows flew, swords and spears glittered, Bard's squad fought bravely, dwarves and Bilbo Baggins fought desperately. One of goblins hit the hobbit with a mace. He fell down, and didn't hear how the battle ended when the enemy retreated. At least I am not yet one of the fallen heroes, but I suppose there's still time enough for that! What a surprise! Still alive! - Well, how I'm glad! - And me too! Come. You are called for. Farewell, hobbit. Farewell, good thief. I go now to the halls of waiting, to sit beside my fathers, until the day, when world is renewed. I wish to part from you in friendship, and to take back my words. Farewell, King under the Mountain. No mountain of gold can amend this ending. Yet I am glad - glad that I have shared in your perils. It's been more than a hobbit deserves to take part in adventures like this. You are wrong. Wrong. You're much better than you imagine. Some courage and some wisdom, blended in measure. If dwarves valued food, and songs, above hoarded gold, it would be a merrier world. Farewell. You've renounced the right to your share. But I would award you most richly of all! Thanks, Balin. But it seems to me that a heap of gold... ...will give me nothing but trouble. Then accept our gift. Oh, thank you. Thank you, friends. - Farewell, Dori! - And farewell to you, Bilbo Baggins. Farewell, Nori! Farewell, Ori! Farewell, Oin! Farewell, Gloin! Farewell, Bofur! Farewell, Bifur! Farewell, Bobmur! Farewell, Dwalin! Farewell, Kili and Fili! Well, I wish a good journey to you, Bilbo. Wherever it may take you. If ever you visit us again, what a feast we'll arrange for you! Thanks, friends, thanks. And if ever you are passing my way, you are welcome. Tea is served at four. But you are welcome at any time. Good luck, friends! Good luck! The road leads far and far away, Under the sun or under the moon, But the voice of the heart will call - And you are coming back to home. You quietly look and look around, And in the meadow you will see The house from your childhood, And hills and trees and flowers. Hills and trees and flowers. All things come to an end, even our story. A day came when mr. Bilbo Baggins caught a sight... ...of the country where he had been born and bred. He returned to his home, and the kettle on the hearth whistled more musically than in former times, in the quiet days before the unexpected party. He took to writing poetry and visiting the elves, with whom he recalled his adventures. He remained very happy to the end of his days, and those were long, extraordinarily long.
