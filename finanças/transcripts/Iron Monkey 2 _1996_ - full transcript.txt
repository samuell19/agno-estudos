Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you, everybody! Thank you! Thank you! Go to hell! Jade Tiger. You've taken my properties, and conspire with the Russians, you will pay for it! - Be patient. See what they want. - Welcome, everybody. I hope that your evening is not ruined by that madman. Let me introduce my friend, the Russian Ambassador, Mr Bajove, to open our ceremony. I am flattered. Jade Tiger, you are the host. You should open the ceremony. Without your support, there'd be no ceremony. - It would be rude to refuse. - Mr Bajove, please. PROSPEROUS FUTURE Here comes the Monkey! It's an excerpt of a Chinese opera, "18 Monks versus the Monkey King". How come he stands on the monks? Buddy, let's roll. Run, quick! Big Brother! Watch out! Big Brother! Be careful! Round them up! Come on, get down. - My eyes! - Kim... I, Iron Monkey, will come and get you! Drink up! Don't panic, steer straight! What shall we do? Be careful! - Someone has fallen into the sea! - Help, please help! Help! Quick, please! Help us! Please help us! Help! - The sea is treacherous! - Let me pass, I'll save you! Please help us! We're not going to make it. Come on, hold on to the rope! - Be careful! - Hurry! Come on! Hurry! Hold on to the buckets! Hold on tight and be quick! Hurry up! Bastard! Big Brother! Chun, I'll give you three more days. - By then, you'll have nowhere to hide. - You'll get the money! I am counting on you. No problem. This is your fee. No, it's my job to pass on messages and gather information. Please take it, don't argue. Don't worry, I'll spread the message. Thank you ever so much. Don't worry, word will spread quickly. The weather is fine, the road is busy. I, Old Kim, have got information. There is a high price on some heads. Come to the tea house this afternoon. Someone is hiring assassins. Someone is hiring assassins. - Someone is hiring assassins. - Someone is hiring assassins. What is he saying? I see! Where do I find money? Someone is hiring assassins. At the tea house. High price? That's my hope! Blind man, you must have heard about something. What are they talking about? Pay up, I'll sing for you. There you are. All right, listen carefully. # Let Old Kim sing for you # An old friend has treated me badly # Other things are bad enough but killing your friend is the worst # How can you not be angry? # These people have all got the message, so they come. But I don't see the Iron Monkey here. The legend goes that the Iron Monkey never shows his face. So... I'll go and find out. I know you are all heroes who don't fear death. Lady Cheung needs your help, and she'll pay generously. - Who's the target? - The Jade Tiger! # To kill the Jade Tiger for a fee # Come to the tea house, don't miss this chance if you can do it # Don't hesitate, go there quick! # Total nonsense, I don't understand what you are singing. - Ten thousand taels. - Eight thousand. - Three thousand. - I'll do it for free. I'll take this job. You need someone competent to kill the Jade Tiger. Do you think they are competent? - What do you mean by that? - Let's compete. Where do you belong to, mate? Look at him, he's a joke! I suggest you introduce yourself, mate. Who are you? Speak! - I am... - The Iron Monkey! - My hero, I've found you at last! - Please get up, my lady. My family was attacked. There are eight bodies, still unburied. - I'm grateful that you've saved me. - Don't mention it. Could I make a request, please? This lady's whole family was murdered. All eight of them. I'll take the job and give all the proceeds to this lady. So she can give her family a funeral. Please accept 1000 taels as down payment. Thank you, my lady. I'll bring the head of Jade Tiger back in three days. You are a natural actress, you're simply amazing. I learn that from you. Let's enjoy ourselves to celebrate our success. I'll do anything you ask. You are a good girl. Let's go. I didn't know that the name "Iron Monkey" was so powerful. It's so easy to make money. Come on, take out the money. - That's a lot of money. - This is yours. No, you've to pay off your debt. You don't pay off debts, you repudiate them. Give my money back! It's my money! My money! Wow, there's so much money! - Hurray! Thank you so much! - Thank you! That rascal owes you money, yet he's giving money away! Put me down! Please! Go and get him, quick! - Stand there! - Run, quick! Hurry up! Let us pass! Hurry up! Chun! Are you all right? Barely surviving! We must leave here at once. - Where are we going? - We'll think of something. - Please. - Sir! Come in. - What's the matter? - I've got news. It's a big secret. The Iron Monkey is coming to kill you. Everyone knows that. Why don't you wait till I'm dead to tell me this? This time is different. I got this information directly. Someone is paying Iron Monkey handsomely, She's called Charmin Cheung, just returned from abroad. She's the daughter of this house's former owner, Man-chin Cheung. - Is it true? - She's hiring assassins to kill you. - Is that true? - It's truer than the truth, and... It fits none of them. - My poor legs. - Give it back to me. Give back what? This? This man looks familiar. That's right, it's he. - Do you know him? - Of course I do. He... What's his name? He's called... Oh, dear! I can't remember. He's... Hey! Here you are. You know this man, don't you? He's Sharp Kim. That's right! Sharp Kim. - You know him? - I know him very well. - Oh, you know my dad well? - We're bosom friends. - Is he your father? - He surely is. This portrait reminds me of the past. Where is he now? It's a long story. Let's sit down and I'll tell you everything. We're going to have a hearty meal. All the dishes are here. Help yourself, don't be shy! Where is the fish we ordered? We are here for the fish. Hurry up. - OK, coming. - We'll have Swallow's Nest for dessert. Coming soon. These are your father's favourite dishes. You'll like them, too. Does he eat these all the time? That must have cost a lot of money. Your father and I never talk about money. I'm always paying. So we expect the same from you. - Come on. - See if there's any sign of the dessert. - Waiter! - What do you mean by "sign"? Any signs of Sharp Kim. - My father? What's happened to him? - We've been thinking if we should tell you this. Of course we have to tell him. Sharp Kim is his father, we must tell him. How much money have you got for your dad? Don't expose your money in public. You need not worry, we'll help you find him. Why does the Swallow's Nest take so long? Oh, it's ready? - I'll kill you all! - Run, quick! - There's another one! - Stop there! See where you can hide. Please, don't kill me. Help! Run, hurry! How come you've got so many enemies? We dine with you and almost get killed. - Deal with them now. - Hit him, beat him up, quick! - One strike and you're out! - You are marvellous! It won't take you long, mate. But please tell us, what will you do about the debt between us? - Yes, tell us. - That will be scrapped, of course. That's good. Get your bum off here! - Kim - Monkey! I've been looking for you these years. Not until now that I have heard about you, that I knew I could find you here. At first I thought you'd returned home. Look at me, I can't face my folks at home. I can't face my son. What do you want to do now? Can I do anything for you? I hope you can tell my wife and my son what kind of person I really am. I certainly will. Why don't you tell them? No, that won't do. They see me as an irresponsible father, who abandoned them, and so I have no right to see them. Kim... I'll take care of them. Come on! Go up. Come on. Hurry up. - Isn't there a door? - Sure, but it belongs to other people. This house is not mine, but it has a good view, so I just borrow it. What do you think? Good, isn't it? Let's live here. If you don't like it, there's another one upstairs. - No, I mean I don't want to bother you. - Don't worry. - Tell him what friends are for. - All right. Friends are to be exploited, mates are to be betrayed. Understand? My mum says, "Find friends that are loyal and honest." # He's left home for 20 years # His poor wife and children are still waiting for him # The poor orphan walked thousands of miles in search of his father # The father sees his son yet dare not speak to him, what a tragedy! People would take that as a portrait of a wanted man. I haven't seen my dad for decades. I wonder how he is now. You are lucky. We don't know what our parents look like. He's right, we are orphans. You grew up in an orphanage? We don't want you to be orphans like us. So we'll help you to find your dad. - It looks good! - I hate guns, but can't do without them. I can use this to remove Iron Monkey. Then I'll really be invincible. If our business goes smoothly, you'll be our sole distributor of firearms in the Southwest. Thank you. Name a price. - Deal! - Good! After you. Let's try out your guns and test their marksmanship. - Get off! - We're the representatives of this town. Go to hell! - What are you doing? - They slaughter away in broad daylight! - You can't do anything about it. - We see it all the time. - There's nothing you can do. - Let's go, don't get into trouble. That's really powerful, wonderful. I'm very happy with your new products. Tell your boss to get the cash ready. We'll meet at the usual place. That's no problem. Absolutely marvellous. - Does this man really know my dad? - You just do as I tell you. Remember what I said. - Good day. - You are punctual. Please sit down. - I, Iron Monkey, always... - Give it up. I know your name is Chun. I've been checking on you. So, do you know who is that man there? - Iron Monkey? - The older, the wiser. You're sharp. I went to the tea house on his behalf. We'll pay up as long as you accomplish the task our lady gives you. We don't care who you are. Good. He'll do anything you ask. Will you? He says, are you searching for your dad? See? Please be assured that he'll do whatever you ask. I'm a stranger to this place, but you are really kind to me. My mum is right. She says I'll meet kind and helpful people. You must have rotten luck to have met us. - So it's agreed, then. - Yes, it's all right. I wish you good luck. - How is it? What did he say? - People are looking for your dad. - There are people looking for him? - Seeking vengeance. You're in danger. - What should I do? - Let me see. I've promised you I'd find him, so let me deal with them. No. Tell me who they are, I'll deal with them myself. - You? - Yes, it's my business, I have to do it myself instead of dragging you in. - What is our relationship? - We're friends. - What do friends do? - Stick together. That's right. I'll help you, but you have to listen to me. What's happened? The target is here. Let me go first. I'm Iron Monkey. Put down your weapon. I won't hurt you if you put down your weapons. Are they scared stiff? That's odd. Don't fool around. Stop it. - Who are you? - I'm Iron Monkey. Then do you know who I am? You? You are a firearms smuggler and dealer. So you are the con! How dare you say that? - Are you all right, Chun? - My poor bum. I can't do it. Your turn. - You are good. That's more like it. - Of course. - Let's help him. - No, wait. Let him do the rough stuff. Can you see that? It's a dead body. I'm scared. Don't be afraid. There must be some treasure nearby. We've hit the jackpot! - Since when can you drive? - My nickname is Almighty Wonder Boy. - Can you do it? - No problem. - You are good. Who are you? - Iron Monkey. - Another one? - How about you? Get them! Hurry up! The weapons are gone! They must have stolen them. Go get them! Go! Quick! Chun! Chun! - Iron Monkey? Where is Chun? - You? I don't know. - I've waited for him for a whole day. - Thank you for killing the arms dealer. - Arms dealer? - You're too modest. News spread fast. - We all know Iron Monkey did this. - But I'm not Iron Monkey. You're mistaken. Chun says you know where my dad is. How is he now? - Where is he now? - Your dad? I think Chun has conned us. He said you were the Iron Monkey. You can kill Jade Tiger and the arms dealer, to seek revenge for our lady. Yet he's run away with the money. - You want to see me? - That's right. We've come for you. How can I help? - She is my sister. - Brought your calling card? - It's not a friendly visit. - Have I stubbed your toe? - You haven't offended me. - So where are you from? It's none of your business. Here you are. I heard that you want the firearms. I've got a consignment, if you want. - How many do you have? - As many as you want. - Name a price. - We don't want money. Then what do you want? - He wants to be your manager. - I'm interested in singing. - That's right. - I agree to your terms. Where are the goods? - The goods... - They want to con our master! Get him! Calm down! Easy. Sis, undress and let them see what's inside. That's fake, but these are the real thing. Good for you! Deal! It's delicious. One more! Your dishes, gov. - Give me a pail of wine. - Coming. Wine! I've told you, Uncle Chung, I won't meet Lady Cheung. - Please go. - Let's eat, then we'll talk. One can't find loyal servants like you in the towns. People have changed since the foreign powers arrived. How is my dad now? Don't wait for me, I won't come. Please go. - Uncle Chung, you go home first. - Yes, miss. Waiter! - The bill, please. - Seven dollars, please. - Keep the change. - Thank you very much! Do you want to make some money? I have a job for you. Name the fee. Wait! Stand there! I do need money, but I won't be enslaved by it. I'm really sorry, but I can't help you. I've got more important things to do. I'm really flattered by you. If we shall meet again, I'll buy you a drink. Goodbye. Please wait. She's the girl our boss wants. Get her! Run, quick! How dare you? Do you know who is my boss? I don't care! I only need to know who I am. Leave me alone! Let's leave here. Nicolai, let me get them. I can't stand this! Don't be afraid. Let's go! This way. This way! You bitch! Go to hell! Shoot, Mr Kim, shoot! Go to hell, you bastard! I can't fire a gun! Come, let me dress your wound. Jade Tiger won't let you get away. I think you should leave here. Mr Kim, it's dangerous outside. You mustn't go out. I'm asking for information about your dad. - Thank you very much. - Miss Cheung... Let me do it. I'm all right. Take it easy. Uncle Chung, let me find my father on my own. Lady Cheung needs you to look after her. Get her out of here. If I have the chance, I'll kill Jade Tiger for her. Please take care. See you. Go clean it. Uncle Fong, Mr Chiu, how are you today? How are you today? Do it properly! - What would you like to drink? - Coffee, orange juice and lemonade. Sorry, what would you like? I want to see your manager! Are you a fool? Serve the customers. Go on! Yes, sir. What are you doing here? Go and serve the customers. What are you staring at? Go to work! Boss, you're back already? Boss, you must be exhausted. He is Chun, the man I told you about. What are you doing? These two VIP are dealing arms with our boss. - Stop. Play a Japanese song. - Yes. Cynthia, sing a Japanese song. Please accept my apologies. - Do you think I do it right? - You are doing beautifully. - Let's replace the girls. - Go away, you two! - I found two pretty ladies. - Get lost. I'll get them myself. This one is pretty. So lovely, so big. - What are you doing? - Calm down. You bitch! The boss will sort her out. Music! Let's dance! Cynthia, are you OK? We'll leave here as soon as we get enough money. Money is not everything, but you can't do anything without it. Have you ever considered whether you are doing the right thing or not? I do this for our future. I must make money, make lots of money from Jade Tiger. - Where are you going? - I'm leaving here. Are you coming? Where to? You don't have a bean on you! Do you think Jade Tiger will pay you? He doesn't see you as human. - I've got brains... - Don't deceive yourself. All you think about is money. You betrayed Kim, you've no friends. You conned Charmin, you've no morals; you show no affection to me, either. I did betray Kim, but I've also helped him. I am a conman, but who in this world has never cheated anyone? You say I don't show my affection to you. I don't know if it's you that doesn't understand about affection, or it's I who doesn't understand it. If you want to go, go! Cynthia, Cynthia! I have no friends, I betray my mates. Am I really that bad? Sir? Sir. I've carried out Master Tiger's order, all the cops are on stand-by. They'll report once they have sightings of Iron Monkey. Shall we get the blind man in? He's the bait to catch Iron Monkey! Oh, I see. I'll go back to work. What do you want? Stop there! - What do you want? - Your boss. Mr Chin, please. He's a friend of our boss. You are... You are a pillar of the community, but you don't play fair. My brother and I deal arms with you, we never bother you. What are you talking about? Who are you? - You have the cheek to ask me? - You are... Jade Tiger, how dare you cross me? That's outrageous. - Who are you? - Can't you tell? You are Mr Chin's brother? What about our firearms? What about my brother's life? Brother? Firearms? I was about to ask you who got the arms. And you have the cheek to ask me for it? - Stop pretending. - I, pretending? - Is here your turf? - Yes. - Is it your patch? - Yes. - Where did the arms vanish from? - The timber mill. - Is the timber mill yours? - Yes. - Are you the boss? - Of course! I control everything here. You are the boss, so who else could have taken the firearms? You. OK, I'll get someone to meet you. He can prove I didn't do it. - Get the old trash here. Hurry up, go on! Useless thing. This old trash is Iron Monkey's mate. We got him there that night. He knows what's going on. But he wouldn't speak. - Monkey? - Old trash, where are my weapons? Where are your people? My people are everywhere. The weapons are in the right hands. Very well. I know what to do now. - Give me the gun. - Hold on! Are you not telling me? See how hard your head is. Shoot, kill me. I won't let you use me to get Iron Monkey. OK, if that's what you want. What do you mean by that? There's no bullet! What are you playing at? Take it easy. I just want to scare this old trash. Of course I believe you. If this old thing really died, how would I find the real culprit? Very well. Give me this old thing as an offering to my late brother. Let me find my arms, then I'll do business with you. Master Tiger, the arms are taken by... him! It's he, it's he! Thank God! Brother, you're alive! - I've been looking for you everywhere. - You're not my... He's Iron Monkey! Let's get out of here! Kim, you go on, I'll cover you! Hurry! Kim. - I'll deal with them. - Monkey, you go! Get them! Kim! Kim! - Kim! - Take this, Tell my son to go home and look after his mum, go on! Hurry, go on! Monkey! Rid the devil, remove the tiger! Jesus says, O man, dust to dust, ashes to ashes. You don't hate Chun? I don't know him well, but I know he's not really that bad. I don't know him, either. I always think that he lives for money. What's wrong about that? Men die for money, birds die for food. I can tell that people are unhappy here. I do feel sorry for you both. You have no parents, so what does Chun have? I hope he'll make a lot of money and you'll forgive him. I wish I led such a simple life as yours. I want you to talk to him as a friend. O Lord, bless your children. Guide us towards your wishes. Lead us away from evil and suffering. Amen. It's you! I'm not an arms dealer. It was a misunderstanding. - I know you are Kim. - Who are you? What's your relation to my dad? - We are comrades. - Where is my father? He has... Your father wanted me to tell you, he was not an irresponsible man. He hadn't finished his work, so he couldn't face you. His dying wish was that you should go home to look after your mum. No, I won't go home. I believe what my father did was right. I'll finish what he set out to do. My mother will understand, she will agree. I must avenge. Jade Tiger! Even family should get the sums straight. Bear, this is your money. You're right. It's better to make sure everything is above board. - Bear, I want you to kill this... - I don't want to know too much. I am more than willing to help you. That's nice, very brotherly. You are always welcome here. I knew you wanted my help, or you wouldn't have contacted me. I hear that Iron Monkey is causing a lot of trouble. It's not difficult to get some peace, is it? You may have peace, but I don't. Hey, who are you? My dear sir... The firearms are in the back yard, follow me. There it is! Hurry! Kim! Cynthia, get out of here! Not that easy! What's happened? Look after Cynthia! Iron Monkey! You've come. - Let's get the weapons out quickly. - Yes. Don't worry, I'm with you no matter what happens. I must get the arms to the South before dawn. Listen to your dad, go home! Look after Cynthia and Chun. Take this money, it'll come in useful. I'm really grateful to you for getting back these firearms. - Chun... - I'm here. What do you need? Nothing, I just want your company. Do you remember I said that we will... - Can you really drive? - Yes, and we're going to have a proper house, with a proper door. I feel cold. Cynthia! Cynthia. I've never cried for anyone. What do you want? I don't need this money, you take it. Wait! You take it home, you'll need it. No, I can't go home like this. I have to settle the matter. Yes! Cynthia, you will not die in vain. We have to do something worthwhile. A bit more to that side. You stupid pig. A bit more to the left. - I'm really sorry! - Are you blind? Go to hell! - You fool, hurry up! - That's Jade Tiger's office. Hold on! You mustn't lose your head. You must use your wits, and don't underestimate your enemy. From now on, we'll launch a two-pronged attack. Go on! - Hurry up, be quick! - OK. What are you doing? Hurry up! I'm sorry, but our boss is out on business. He'll be back soon. Call your boss! Bastard! When will we get our arms? Call your boss, ask him to contact me. Yes, certainly. Hello, Master Tiger, please. Master, I'm Bloody Soldier. It's connected. What, they've torn up the place? Iron Monkey, go to hell! - How do you feel? Are you all right? - I'm fine. Get me out! Get me out, if you have balls! I'll burn you! Let's leave here. Iron Monkey 2
