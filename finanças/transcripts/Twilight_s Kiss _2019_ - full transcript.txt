Lei Lei! Grandpa! Bye bye I want some grapes, Grandpa. Is your cough better? The grapes are so expensive today. They're not that expensive. You're still coughing. No, I'm not. I'm really better now. If you say so. Thanks! Grandpa, I got 80% on my test today! That's great! Let's aim for 90% next time! Grandma! I've made some pear soup for you. Remember to drink it before you go. Grapes? Lei Lei's still coughing. Just a few won't matter. They're bad for her cough. I thought she was better already. Where's Fong? She said Zheng's running late. They're that busy? Hey, Dad. Thanks so much. Good thing you were available. Sorry, I couldn't pick Lei Lei up myself. It's fine. Mommy If you retire, you can pick Lei Lei up every day. Retire? Forget it, what will I do all day? I should keep working while I still can. Hi, Ma. Dinner is ready. Call your sister and see where she is. Fong, where are you? Can you hurry up?! Okay, see you soon. She's not here yet? They're just downstairs. Let's wait for them then. The food will get cold. Then let Lei Lei start. We'll wait. Lei Lei, eat up. Here they are. Sorry. Hi, everyone. Lei Lei Hi, Aunty Fong... You must've taken the old tunnel. The traffic is terrible there. We thought a motorcycle would be faster. Sorry! The food's getting cold, Let's eat, everyone... Here, Lok. The chicken looks delicious, Ma! Cousin Jessica left me a message yesterday. She said Uncle's out of the hospital, did you know that? I haven't heard a thing. Oh, really... I'm glad he's fine. Come on, let's eat. How's it going? I'm good. You come here often? No, I was just passing this way... I'm Hoi. You want to go in there? Why don't we... be friends first? Perhaps another time... Hey, should I throw this old shirt out? It's all worn out. It looks fine to me. The edges are all fraying. Do whatever you want. You never care about anything... You need to have a word with Fong. Tell her that Zheng is not right for her. why? He's much younger than her. No one cares about that in this day and age. Women age much quicker. She's almost 40, Men won't find her attractive anymore. What a coincidence. Indeed it is. You're not working today? I'm retired. I even got my Senior Citizen Card last year. My granddaughter's school is nearby. That's why I hang around here. Oh, you have a granddaughter? Yeah. Why? Nothing How about you? What about me? You look like a married man. How long have you been married? I've been divorced for a long time. How come? I was a terrible husband! Yes, I treated her really badly I used to work at a camera factory, The boss organised picnics for workers and their families. I wouldn't tell her about them because I'd rather go by myself. Then someone told her about it. She got so upset and went back to her parents. I knew that she wanted me to bring her home. But I stayed away. She reluctantly made her way home eventually. You live with your son? Yeah. After the divorce, I raised him on my own. Your ex didn't want him? She wanted to remarry. Get in. You're a cab driver? Yeah, I'll give you a ride home. Sure, but you have to put the meter on. I don't charge my friends. You should sit in the back. I need to buy something. Where are you going? Hey, Do you mind not contacting me at night? Sorry, I'll never bother you again. That's not what I meant. You can call during the day. Hi, Father! We're home. I can't talk now. My son's home. I'll call another time. Everyone was asking about you tonight, Father. How kind, I don't need to show up at every fellowship meeting. Tonight was bible study, not a fellowship meeting. Grace, go take a shower. I've told you many times... Don't say things like that in front of Grace. Grace Grace, I bought you coconut pudding. Sit right here. Dad, did you wash your hands? They're clean. You just threw out the trash. Grace. Shower. Right now. She's just a kid. Let her have some. I told you, kids shouldn't have sugary food at night. She'll have trouble sleeping. I raised you the same way and you turned out just fine. Hey. You shouldn't eat that either. Welcome. What do you want? The Yuenyeung here is very good. You can taste both the coffee and the tea. How about French toast? The syrup here isn't diluted and it's not too sweet. Not like other places. The coconut pudding is famous here too. I'll have whatever. What would you like? Two Yuenyeungs, please. Ok. Do you prefer to go somewhere quieter? There's a spot right there. Park there. I don't want to park on the street. The parking garages around here are expensive. It's fine, I don't mind. Two please. This way. You've never been here before? I drove 18 hours a day for the past 20 years. I only found time for myself after my kids moved out. That's when I started cruising. You've really been missing out... Have you ever been to Yuk Tak Chee, the famous old gay bathhouse? Of course I have. I remember I had no idea what to do the first time I went. I sat in the TV room and just waited and waited. All I saw were people going in and out. ... and in and out... I didn't have a clue what was going on. After a while I just decided to leave. I told a friend later on, and he laughed at me. He said I should have waited until 1am, When they closed up. That's when the real party began. Half a roast duck, please. Fifty dollars Have some Ma, - You know I don't drink. Just a little sip Ma. Have some, it's a celebration. Thank you, Sir. Thank you, Maam. I will take good care of Fong. Come on, Cheers. There's something else I would like to mention. As you know, I'm still struggling financially. I was thinking that we could just keep things simple. So we may not even have the banquet. I hope you understand. It's fine. Let's eat. Thank you He said he can't afford a wedding banquet. That's absurd. He shouldn't have proposed if he can't afford a wedding. I need to talk some sense into Fong. A marriage is for life, you know. I know she's is not young, but there must be better men out there. He should have followed in your footsteps. save some money before getting married. How can someone tell his future mother-in-law that he can't afford a wedding banquet? what? You knew and you didn't you tell me? You're her older brother, You should be looking out for her. This is ridiculous. I need to talk to your dad. I have to go. Hey Lok says that Fong's pregnant and the baby is Zheng's No wonder they're in such a hurry to get hitched. At least he didn't run off. You never give a damn about anything... Let's eat and chat. The Legislative Council is holding public consultations about the gay nursing home proposal over the next four months. I hope you can all share your views. I'd never go to an old folk's home. You might as well send me to prison. I'm still perfectly healthy. The only way I'll go is if my family forces me to. Of course you're fine Fei. You live with your family. But there are folks here like Chiu and Dior who live on their own. They'll need it if they develop health problems. Exactly. If I get forced into a straight nursing home... Tell me, where will all my gorgeous outfits go? That's why I donât keep personal things in my home. I don't want my family to know about me. That's what I'm saying. Imagine living in a place like this... A place where you can be yourself... Where you're among kindred spirits. Wouldn't you be a lot happier? Your skin is very smooth. Don't be silly. It's true. Look at me. You still look fit to me. This body was shaped by decades of hard labour. How hard can driving a taxi be? I used to deliver rice before I was a cab driver. But I knew that I couldn't spend my life carrying rice sacks. So I got myself a taxi license. Our generation had it tough. I was lining up for a job application once. I waited three hours for my turn, then the prick started speaking to me in English. I was stumped, of course. He wouldn't even let me fill out the application form. That very night, I enrolled in night school to learn English. I refused to let anyone look down on me anymore. It must have been tough to raise your son alone. Grace, come here Look, it's Noah's Ark. We're going there on Saturday. You'll have such a blast. Are you sure you don't want to come? I can't walk all day. You guys go. Have a good time. What's with the mess, Father? I'm just sorting these old phots. Grace, do you know who this is? This is when I took your father to the Amusement Park. He was only three, even younger than you now. I digitized the photos for you years ago, You can toss those. You and your computers... I don't know how to work that digital album. I like the real thing. I like holding them in my hands. Dad, can you clear the table, please? It's time for Grace to do her homework. Please support Quality Life Charity Cookies. Please support Quality Life Charity Cookies. Please support Quality Life Charity Cookies. Some cookies, ma'am? Thank you so much. Which tie should I get? Let me give you some options. How about this bow tie? No...let me try that one... - Good! - Let's go with this one. Happy birthday to you... Before we start our meeting today, I want to introduce you to this stud right here. This is Billy from Rainbow Activist Group. I'm here to invite you all to speak in the consultation session about your thoughts on the gay nursing home proposal. You mean we have to reveal who we are in public? A social worker or psychologist can speak on your behalf, But what's more convincing that speaking up for yourself? Dior should be our spokesperson. He's always been bold. I don't want to be the only one who speaks. Chiu should speak, too. He totally stole the limelight at the pride parade last year. No way. Don't ever ask me to speak in public again. Why not, Chiu? Just don't ask me. I'm never speaking up again. Chiu, you've been so quiet recently. What's the matter, Chiu? Nothing. My knees have been acting up again, that's all. -Your knees are in pain? -Yes Want me to take you to the doctor? No need, I can manage on my own. I've got time. Let me go with you. Thanks, but I can cope. No problem. Can you imagine living with Dior for the rest of your days? I quite like that Billy. It's hard to find young people who care about fighting for our rights nowadays. I like him, too. He's got a real cute smile. So are you guys going to speak in that public session? Are you hungry? Is this free? Of course not, but it's only 30 dollars. It looks quite good. Two, please. - Your key numbers? -59 and 57 Take a seat. Thank you. A tall man just walked into the dark room and a bunch of guys followed him. Do you want to join them? Have I met you before? Maybe... Oh, is he an old flame? Please, I'm not like you. I remember every guy that comes my way. I thought you quit drinking? Don't come crying to me when your gout flares up again. And you were supposed to quit gambling. Why do you have the horse racing pages? Save some money for a rainy day. A friend told me about a Chinese remedy that's really good for gout. Oh, what's it called? Is it green papaya tea? That's the one! I've asked him to buy a few packs for you. Sounds good! Thanks so much. But you need to quit drinking first or nothing's going to work! Have some chicken. Are you a couple? Yeah, for ten years already. But he is so young... He must've been even younger 10 years ago. I have no idea what he sees in me. I am old and wrinkly. Oh be quiet, you silly old goat. He loves the old geezers. The wrinklier the better. And he's the wrinkliest in the whole sauna. Like a bitter melon! I bet you two have been together for at least 10 years, right? The breeze moves the clouds, drizzle falls upon the earth They land on me and you, covering the world like poetry The breeze carries the rain, like me taking your hand Look at me looking at you, looking at this beautiful world Ahh...if only I could be the breeze and you be the rain Ahh...the breeze carries the rain We stroll on the plains, the grasses whisper among themselves We tell each other secrets, we explore the world together What's wrong? You miss me already? Are you free this Saturday? Why? My son is away, I'll be alone at home. I don't think that's a good idea. I'm going up to Shenzen with Kit on Saturday. I'll spend the night there. He's taking me to a new massage parlour. Is Ming going? He can't make it. My shoulders have been acting up lately. I'm really getting old. Zheng brought two hairy crabs for us. Hairy crabs? I'm not hungry, you can have them. Where are the crabs? You said you didn't want it. But he brought two. So? You can have yours. I don't want to have it by myself. I'll join you. Go get them. No point in forcing yourself. Well. I want to eat it now. Go on. Take the bigger one. Where did he get them? North Point. He said there is a shop famous in Shanghai there. He went all the way to North Point for two hairy crabs? Obviously it wasn't his idea. Fong must've told him that you like hairy crabs. Whoah...Look at that! Here... Chiu, are you alright? He said he couldn't walk after his acupuncture. Why did you come alone? He usually has someone with him. A real charming guy. Stylish, too. What's was that guy's name? Let's get out of here. Come on... Can you walk? Let's try. Thankyou. Take care. Watch out for the step. Who usually takes you to the doctor? Dior, of course. I'll take you next time. I'm off. What time are you meeting Kit? At 11. Is Ming going? No. Bring a jacket or you'll catch a cold. Have you got your Mainland Travel Permit? It's in the third drawer! I like the wet market more than the supermarket. The air conditioning at the supermarket are always too cold. And, here you can bargain. It's cheaper in supermarkets sometimes. Not by much though. What do you want to eat? Let me do my rounds first. Morning! -Hi there. Do you like grouper? How will you cook it? A fresh fish should be steamed. A simple meal will do. Here, weigh this for me. Ok How much? 128 dollars. You really don't need to splurge on a grouper. What do you want to eat then? Beef and tomatoes. That's it? It's so simple. Beef and tomatoes? How about 120 dollars for the fish? sure... Thanks. Chicken blood, please. It's 4 dollars per piece. How many? Two, please. That's 8 dollars. Here. I got it. Just let me pay. I invited you to dinner, let me pay. I told you, it's on me. No Come on, let's go. Thank you. Bye Bye. Morning What would you like? The chives look good. How much? 12 dollars a catty. That's really expensive! How much do you want? A half-catty... I'll give you a discount, 5 dollars. Fine, but only because I'm your best customer. At least you're well behaved today. Keeping your hands off my vegetables. I wouldn't dare! You're always telling me off. Of course I would! Thanks, take it easy! Thanks, bye! Now we have everything. You just stay put and wait for dinner to be served. How's your cooking? I'm a great cook! You'll be begging for seconds. I hope you don't burn the food. Don't be silly. Do you know what you are doing? I help my wife in the kitchen occasionally. There goes the ginger... There, your beef and tomatoes. What? You're like a hungry ghost. Because it's so delicious! Slow down... Some meat from the soup... Everything tastes great. Have some for yourself. A breeze moves the clouds, drizzle falls upon the earth They land on me and you, covering the world like poetry The breeze carries the rain, like me taking your hand Look at me, looking at you, looking at this beautiful world Ahh...if only I could be the breeze and you be the rain Ahh...the breeze carries the rain We stroll on the plains, the grasses whisper among themselves We tell each other secrets, we explore the world together Are you free next Saturday? Why don't you come with me to see Chiu? My daughter's getting married. I've got a lot to prepare. Oh, right, of course. I should give you a lucky red packet for the wedding. Why don't you bring it on the day of the banquet? You're inviting me? Aren't you afraid that they will... Don't worry, they'll never suspect. It's 70% off. Look at this shirt, it's perfect for you. Really? Let me see. It's nice, but it suits you too. Me? No way, it's perfect for you. No, it's too flamboyant for me. Actually, I think it's perfect for Dior! So how's life as a "mistress"? Nothing good comes out of dating a married man. If it's meant to be, you'll meet in the next life. You're so superstitious... always on about that kind of nonsense. Take your jacket off. Wait right here. I'll get some groceries and cook for you. It's fine, I can take care of myself. What's that smell? What smell? It's from the kitchen. No wonder! You should open the windows when you hang laundry. These clothes smell of mould! Looking good? Wait..this sideburn is a touch longer. - Ok let me fix them -Thank you Iron these pants too. Where did you buy these? Are they expensive? It doesn't matter, it's once in a lifetime. Don't spend too much. We're already paying for the banquet. It's ridiculous that we're paying to marry our daughter off. I thought you were getting rid of this shirt? I know how sentimental you are. If I threw it out, I'd never hear the end of it. Sorry, we started dinner already. Why didn't you answer the phone? I was getting a haircut. I'd turned off the phone and forgot to turn it back on. Didn't you get a haircut two weeks ago? I'm attending a wedding banquet tomorrow. You didn't mention it before. Is it someone we know? Just an old co-worker. His daughter is getting married. You guys don't know them. Should we give them a red packet? Father just said we don't know them. What did you buy today? A shirt for the banquet? Don't you think you're being a little nosy tonight? What's the matter with you? Grace, look at these delicious mushrooms! Have one! Okay, I'll have it then. Welcome. Congratulations. The mah-jong table is ready, Take a drink. - Congratulations ! -Thanks so much You're here! This is my son, Lok. Your son? No wonder. Hi. He really looks like you. - Is that so? -Yes Do you work together? No, I'm already retired. That's great. We've been trying to convince Dad to retire, but he doesn't want to. Ching. My old neighbor. Hoi The one you bumped into recently? Yes, when we were living in Shatin. That was ages ago, before we got married. Mah-jong? I'm not good at it. Don't start playing now. You don't want to delay the banquet. Where are you sitting? He's with my co-workers. Please do enjoy yourself. Let me introduce you to the others. Oh, how beautiful. Your granddaughter is so cute. She is when she's not being fussy. Congratulations! Cheers! Congratulations! Best of luck for the future! Thank you. Please come over for the family photo. Let's take the photo. Please look this way when you're ready. Ready? Three, two, one, smile! - Congratulations - Thank you Thanks so much for inviting me. I'm glad you came. Thanks Congratulations! Thank you. Thank you. Dad. Thanks for this. Don't worry. Have a seat. You have a family now, and you're about to be a dad. You have to work hard. I will. How's the job search going? It's still going...Just waiting for good news. Why don't you get a taxi driver's license. It's not that hard. But I can't afford to rent a taxi... You can drive mine, rent-free. Thank you, Dad. My daughter's in your hands now. Take good care of her, alright? Yes. I leave my life in Your hands Even when I grow old... I'd still happily hand my life... over to You I've never felt tired I've never felt loss Because You bestowed all upon us And You can take it all back I've been greedy before But I can let go now I'll love you with all I have I've learned to live every second for You All for You, all for You You know what I need the most Are you a religious person? Here...Hang this in your taxi. It'll protect you. I had a friend named Ah Bo. We fled China by sea together. He had all sorts of talisman on him, but he drowned anyway. That's why I don't believe in Buddha or anything like that. I only believe in myself You know what my son said when he tried to convert me? What? He said... If I become a Christian, He'd know where to find me when he dies. Grandpa, it's your turn! Grandfather, that's the wrong way! That's the wrong way. It's time for dinner, Lei Lei. Let me finish this round. No, put it away, it's dinner time. Dinner's ready. Take your seats. Sit here, Lei Lei. We're having Western food tonight? Why not try something new? I like it! Then come for dinner more often! Let's eat. I have a chicken leg. It smells good. Use newspaper to clean the windshield so it won't smudge. That windshield must never be dirty. Be gentle with that. Don't forget to clean the bottom edge Otherwise, it will collect dirt. Treat this taxi as your home. When passengers get in the car, treat them like guests in your home. Be courteous and polite. Clear. Showing your son-in-law the ropes, Pak? He's a newbie, so give him some guidance, guys. Brother Bo, are you really thinking of retiring? It's time for him to be set free. What are you going to do? People say retirement is a new lease on life, a golden era. You can do whatever you like, whenever you like. This is called harvesting the cultivated fruit. Like what? Sit at home and scratch your balls? He can fish, play mah-jong... He can even pick up a new hobby! That's fucking dumb. You should go to Dongguan and enjoy some happy endings! You're always saying nasty stuff like that. Are you Christian or Catholic? Do you really want to know? What's the difference? Why don't you come to church with me and find out? Sure, I don't mind... Dear Heavenly Father... Thank You for this food before us. May this food purify and nourish us so that we may have the energy to spread Your good word. In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray, Amen. Amen... Let's eat... Father... Grace's school is having a raffle next Saturday. Are you free? Oh, I already have plans. Again? I can cancel it...I'll be there. And tell me ... How is Joseph's father? They said they need to send him to a home. He went out on his own a few times and got lost. The neighbors had to take him back home. So they decided to send him to a nursing home for good. That's one way to deal with it. If this happens to me, be sure to send me into a home. Father! It's true. I don't want to be a burden on anyone. You don't have to worry about that. Your son cares about you too much. He'd send me to a nursing home before doing that to you. Dad! Ready for your first day at work? I'm ready. I'm off. Be careful on the road. Why are you tearing up? All my life... I always thought you favoured my brother over me. Silly girl... Come on, let's get some breakfast. Everyone... The public consultation session is in two weeks. Will anyone volunteer to speak? I'll be there, but I don't know what to say. Just talking about your own experience is enough. How about you, Chiu? I already said that I won't speak in public again. If we don't speak for ourselves, then who will? When my neighbors saw me at the pride parade on TV last year, they all started mocking me. If I were you, I'd go up to those bitches and say, what are you afraid of? That I'll snatch your husbands away?! Just leave me alone. I'm done speaking in public! How about you, Hoi? To be honest, even if we get a gay nursing home, I wouldn't go. Why not? How would I face my son? If I have to go to a nursing home, I'd rather go to a normal one. I really don't want him to know the truth about me. Friends forever What's that smell? Fong's herbal medicine, for her pregnancy. Is she coming soon? No, I asked Zheng to come by and pick it up. I made you tomato and tofu soup. What will you do now that you're retired? I have no idea yet. Maybe I'll take a shift here and there. Don't do the graveyard shift, your eyes get tired. Lok brought this over today. What is it? An allowance, now that you're retired. Dad. Lok, what's this money all about? I've got enough to spend already. Come and get your money back tomorrow. Keep the allowance, Dad. It's time to enjoy life while you can. Take Ma on a holiday. Spend more time with your granddaughter. We're doing pretty well these days, So don't worry about us. Get some rest and enjoy life for once. Your shirt is so worn out. Look at it. My son is giving me a monthly allowance for my retirement. Congratulations, that's the best thing a father could ask for. I'm lucky. I came to Hong Kong with nothing. Now I have a home and a family. I have no regrets. I'm retired now, so I don't need this anymore. Here, Take it back. So you won't come to church with me? Just try it once? No one in my family is Christian. So I won't know where to find you when we die. That's an awful thing to say. Yeah, I guess you're right. Mainstream society sees us as a minority. When we were young, we had to hide our orientation for many reasons... Our family, parents and careers... Many of us even had to get married so society would see us as "straight" and "normal". Even when we're old... When our parents and partners have passed away and our children have come of age... We still can't be ourselves. That's why I'm here today speaking on our behalf, asking for a nursing home for gay senior citizens. As the saying goes, birds of a feather flock together. Those with similar interests would enjoy each other's company more. That's why we want a home run by gay people for gay people, so that we can live our twilight years with dignity and freedom. And shine in our true colors. We'd gotten along just fine for all these years. But their attitudes changed once they found out what I am. I've experienced a lot of discrimination in my life. So in my old age, I just want to live in a place where I can be myself, free of judgement. Turn the volume down... Grace is sleeping. Lei Lei ...
