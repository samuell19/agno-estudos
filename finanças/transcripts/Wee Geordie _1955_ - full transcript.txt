Correct, McPherson. The male fox is a dog fox and the female is a vixen. We now try something a wee bit more difficult. An animal more common south of the border but still to be found here in the Highlands, the badger. Now does any boy know the names of the male and the female badger? A most expressive silence. I do sir. Did somebody speak? Yes sir. Me sir. Geordie McTaggart. Well then stand up, Geordie McTaggart. I am standing up sir. Ignore the hollow cachinnations of the half-witted Geordie, and advance. It may well be that what Geordie lacks in inches he makes up in knowledge. Maybe. Tsk, tsk, tsk. Geordie. We must help you to rise to higher things. There now. I trust that after all this build up, we're not going to get short weight. Very good, Geordie. Though no better than we should have expected from the son of a gamekeeper. Well, you may retire from the scene of your triumph and er, return the stool to its proper place. Hey titch, where are you going? Hey titch! Wee titch Geordie! Come on. Geordie! Hello wee Geordie. Hello wee Jean. I'm bigger than you all the same. Och, half an inch maybe. Did you bring your sandwich piece? Aye. Mine's cheese. What's yours? Pork. Will they be hatched yet? A dinna ken. It takes a terrible long time for eagles to hatch. Supposing there's no nest there when we get there. Of course it's there. I know it's there. How do you know it's there? Because Dad said whatever I did, not to go to the top of the glen where the Golden Eagles' nest was. Then where did you tell him we was going? He never asked, so I never said. You're a canny wee laddie. Don't call me wee! Och, sorry Geordie. I get enough of it at school. Have you finished? Aye. How do you whistle like you did, Geordie? Just put two fingers in your mouth and blow. I've tried but nothing happens. Like this. See? Och, come on Jean. It's a long climb. I can do it now Geordie. Did you hear? Aye. - Look there. - Where? It looks like a hare it had. The eggs must be hatched. We'll just take a wee peek and come away. I've heard tell that eagles carry off babies. That's storks. I'll go sideways with my hands on the top ledge. You keep 'em off with the stick. Take care Geordie. Watch out Geordie! I'm going Geordie. There's two grey chicks with feathers on them Geordie. Look out Jean! You're braw Jean. So are you Geordie. It'll be dark before we get home. Aye. Good night Geordie. Good night Jean. Everybody can't be big. Good night Jean. Hello Mum. I've brought in some wood. Thank you dear. It's past seven o'clock. You're late for your supper. Aye, Mum. Where have you been since school? There's not much wood left in the shed, Mum. I'll chop some more the morn's morning. Och, you're a good wee soul. You huvnae got your tatties. I'll help myself, Mum. Hold your plate up or they'll be on the floor. Thanks Mum. There you are. What's the matter with you? Nothing Dad. Nothing. I see here they're selling sheets in Perth at half price. Fourteen eleven. It's unlike you to be thinking of the cost of sheets. It was the half price that caught my eye. Past your bedtime, my lad. Yes Dad. Now I've got to go over to the big house to see the laird about the grouse. Come on now. Off to bed with you. Och, give him a chance to finish, Bob. If he will come in at this time of night then he must expect to hurry. I don't know where he's been or what he's up to. Alright Dad. I'm going. Good night. Good night, Geordie. Good night, lad. Well I expect I'll be asleep by the time you get home. Don't be too late, Bob. No I won't be late. Good night love. Good night Bob. Morning Mr. Duncan. Hey, what are you doing jumping out at me like that? I was expecting a communication. Didn't want it to go astray, you understand. Communications in my hands, young man, never go astray. As a matter of fact, I think there is something here in a, in a plain cover addressed to "G. McTaggart Esq." That's me. Oh is it now? Well I'm not sure that I should hand it over, you know, before it reaches its destination. Thanks Mr. Duncan. Hey, G. McTaggart Esquire! Henry Samson, PO Box 689, Wadsworth, London N10. The greatest physical culture expert on earth. Dear Geordie. First let me congratulate you on taking the Samson road to strength. It is the royal road to health and fitness and I have the greatest pleasure in welcoming you as a fellow passenger. I enclose herewith the first installment of my famous physical culture course. I shall take a personal interest in your case because I know I can make a superman of you. Here is a photograph of myself as an example and an inspiration. I may add that this is an actual unretouched photograph. I also enclose the Henry Samson success poem, which I want you to say aloud as you do your exercises. Today I may be frail and weak But soon I will be tough as teak With muscles huge and massive chest I'll prove the Samson way the best For I'm the good old English bulldog breed And Samson will teach me to succeed Yours in strength, Henry Samson. When you finish section one, write and let me know, and I'll send you section two. Enclose half a crown for expenses. The Henry Samson Body Building Course. First of all, give up, smoking, give up drinking. Exercise one: Lie flat on the back. Today, I may be frail and weak But soon I will be tough as teak With muscles huge and massive chest I'll prove the Samson way the best For I'm the good old Scottish bulldog bree... There's nothing the matter with Geordie, is there? Not by the way he polished off that heap of tatties just now. Why? I was just wondering. I was up by the old quarry this evening. The lad was lying there stretched out, talking to himself and grunting something awful. Are you sure there's nothing on his mind? Nothing that I've noticed. Was it maybe exercises he was doing? Could be. I didna ask him. You know the way he is. Well he's up to something no doubt, is our Geordie. First, loosen up the muscles See fig. two. What's going on up there? It's the exercises, I wouldn't be surprised. But he can't knock the place about like this. Don't upset the wee lad, Bob. Let him get it out of his system. Exercise two: A vitally important breathing exercise. Fill your lungs with pure fresh air. Throw your window wide at night, whatever the weather, whatever the season, and Happy Christmas to you. Intermediate course. Exercise nine: Lie on your back, touch your toes, then fling yourself into a horizontal position. Repeat this 50 times every day. It's like the trains going by but you get used to it. Six months' time you will be surprised at the difference this simple exercise will have made to you. I only wish, McTaggart, that you had gained as much in knowledge these last few years as you have in height and weight. Nevertheless, you have managed to obtain your school leaving certificate. The secret of weightlifting is balance. Raise the weights slowly above your head and then, this is the difficult part, lower it gently to the floor. A very happy 21st birthday to you, Geordie, me boy. Breakfast Geordie. Coming Mum. - Happy birthday Geordie. - Thanks Mum. Many happy returns of the day, lad. Thanks Dad. This is a big day for you Geordie. Aye. I've got a wee present for you. Oh Dad, they're wonderful. That'll make things a wee bit lighter around the house. Dad had to have them specially made. And this is from me. Your Auntie Flora and I have been knitting it for you all winter. Oh Mum, you shouldn't have bothered. Now you can read your birthday cards while you sit down and take your porridge. Aye. Do be careful Geordie. There's hardly a chair in the house that hasn't been mended now. Sorry Mum. "The best pupil I ever had." That's grand of Mr. Samson, isn't it Mum? It is Geordie. There are times when I feel I've known him all my life. That's just how I feel too, Dad. If you're looking for a card from Jean, I'm afraid there isn't one. I wasn't really expecting one. You haven't seen so much of her since you took up the course. She thinks the exercises are a waste of time. That's practically blasphemy. Dad! Sorry. Now don't go dreaming Geordie. We've a day's work ahead of us, and the laird doesn't pay you two pound ten a week for nothing. Och, don't fuss the lad, Bob. He's a heap of porridge to get through. Aye, and since it takes most of my two pound ten, I've a mind not to waste it. Hello Geordie. I'd better be getting along. I've the chickens to see to. Many happy returns of the day Geordie. Thanks Jean. How's the exercises? Fine Jean. You'll be an elephant before you're through. Och, Jean. Do not "och" at me, Geordie. I wonder you can waste your valuable time talking to me like this. There shouldn't be anybody in the forest. It canna be the laird. He's away in Perth. Did you hear a shot? Aye. Fetch Jimmy, Rob and Alec and make for the white burn. Come on. If it is poachers, they won't be local lads. Aye, you're right. Not this time of day. They're away. I dinna think they've got the beast though. No. They wouldn't have time to load it. The ruffians must have spotted Jimmy and Robin. I'll put the poor beast out of his misery. We'll have to drag it back. Have you a rope Dad? Aye. We're in for a storm Dad. Aye. What's up Dad? Just a wee pain. I'll be alright. We'll leave the beast here till morning. I'll come with Jim to fetch it. - Aye. - Take a rest Dad. No, no lad. I'm better now. And the worst of the storm's to come. Rest I said Dad. We must get back, lad. Give me your arm. Fetch the pony. I can't leave you here. I'll carry you. It's more than three miles son. I'll manage. What is it then, doggie? Mum. Geordie what's the matter? Geordie what's happened? Oh Geordie. What is it Bob? He's bad Mrs. McTaggart. He should have listened to what I told him last year. It's not only his heart now. He's got pneumonia from the exposure. He wants to see Geordie. Go on lad. Just stay a minute. Hello Dad. I'm sorry I dinna take kindly to Mr. Samson. You did him proud the noo. Och. Did you fetch the gun? Not yet Dad. You left it there. I forgot. Geordie. Yes Dad. You ken my Black Watch kilt? Aye. I'd like you to keep it. You might use it one day. Och. Don't talk that way Dad. Now go away and fetch the gun. And clean it right. I will. Where are you going Geordie? To fetch Dad's gun. Can I come? If you like. He said I was to keep his Black Watch kilt. He's bad then Geordie? Aye. I never knew Dad's heart was bad. I don't want Dad's kilt. I want my dad. For he had the dignity and humility of a simple, kindly man. And we who are gathered here will remember him for the rest of our lives. Hello Geordie. Good afternoon Betty. The laird said he wanted to see me. Well you can please yourself, but he's in a rare old mood this afternoon. Geordie McTaggart to see you. Now George. Come in, come in, come in, my boy. Come in. You asked me to call sir. Ah yes. Yes, I did, I did, I did. I er, I wanted to have a talk with you George. How are you? I'm fine sir. Thank you. Good, good. Well now, George... Er, sit you down, sit you down, George. Well George. There's er, there's not much I can say about your father that er, that McNab didn't say in the kirk yesterday. Though he, he might have made some mention of his abilities as a gamekeeper. Yes, well perhaps, perhaps the kirk wasn't quite the place to say it. No. No perhaps not. Anyway George, he was my very good friend. Oh yes. Yes George, I'll er, I'll have to see about, about getting you a new suit. The market George. I don't know where on earth I'm going to get the money to pay for it. Everything, everything costs so much these days, George. You know, in my grandfather's time, a gentleman could live by what he grew and shot. Nowadays, nature provides alright but the government taketh away. Yes, the whole country's going to pot. There you are, George. Ah, just give that to what's-his-name, George, and he'll fix you up. Of course it's all the fault of that confounded rabble they've got up there in Parliament. What are your politics, George? - What was that sir? - Your politics. I'm a liberal sir, like my dad. Good for you George, good for you. Not many of us left though. Not many of us left. Yet liberals know they never did anybody any harm. Never did much good either. Just, just stood still. I suppose that's why there's not so many of us left George. Nobody wants to stand still these days. Everybody wants to go some place. A lot of nonsense. Just get blown to blazes if we go any further, eh, George? Ah well, I'm lucky to have you. Yes sir. Ah well, that's... that's settled, George. What sir? Thank you Betty. Do you drink George? No. No sir, no. Hmm? Oh my goodness George. Time you started. I started this when I was, oh let me see, er, oh, just after I gave up milk. Oh George, there was something I had to tell you. I saw a snow bunting this morning down by Steeple Hill. There was a hawk there too, George. A kestrel. There's a lovely bird for you George. Kestrels. Never shoot a kestrel George. Never shoot kestrels. They're wonderful birds and do a power of good. You know I had a book, I had a book, in fact I have a book, somewhere, about snow buntings. You'll never believe it George but last spring I had a man in, I had a man in to catalogue all this. Cost me a fortune. Since then I've never been able to find a darn thing. Well I hope you'll find the extra come in handy George. And remember, no shooting kestrels. They're a wonderful, wonderful bird. Goodbye George. Goodbye sir. Goodbye. Oh George? How's Jean? Jean sir? She's fine. Ah, nice girl, Jean. A real nice, nice girl. Goodbye George. What did all that mean? It means you're the laird's head keeper now, heaven help you. Geordie! Wee Geordie! Aye. Another letter from Mr. Samson. Thanks Postie. That'll be my Masters Course. I'll just put it under this stone. You're still carrying on with it now that the laird has made you his keeper? Och aye. I'm ever so near the finish. Do you know the thought that came to me on the way up? What? You're a big fella, sure enough, but maybe almighty providence would have made you just as big, if you'd never done any exercises at all. That's no very likely. No, but it's a comical thought. I wouldn't have said comical. The exercise was a big expense. Och. Aye. Dear Geordie, I am in receipt of yours of the 30th ult. enclosing a further one pound ten for my masters course. Your progress to date is really amazing. Many is the time I think of my star pupil deep breathing the Samson way by lock and fell. And I ask myself, does the lad ever think where all this is leading? I believe the time has come for you to specialize, Geordie. In what, you may ask. Well, why not let national characteristics dictate your choice? In Russia for instance, they generally lift weights. In Australia it's swimming but in Scotland the tendency is to throw things. The hammer, the javelin, the caber. I think you should throw something, Geordie. The path of physical culture leads but to the object so why not make your object say, hammer-throwing? You could toss the caber for variety. Well, here goes Ben. Hey! - Why it's you George. - Yes sir. But George. You just missed me. What the living blazes are you up to George? Throwing the hammer sir. Why? Temper? No sir. I'm specializing. Dinna know you was there sir. Look George. I was lying there quietly watching a capercaillie, - when all of a sudd... - I'm awful sorry sir. I was aiming for yon tree. Oh you were, were you? Well sing out next time, George, otherwise it's only a matter of time before you depopulate the Highlands. It's just that Mr. Samson thinks I'm built for it sir. Oh really? You know I believe I could help you in that George. Yes er, look er, let me, let me see you swing the brute George. Uh, just a minute George. Right George. I was, I was trying to think how they do it at the Highland Games. Yes, I've seen these fellas often enough. They, they swing it, they swing it round and round the heads, you know? That's what I did sir. Well maybe you didn't do it enough. George. Stop, stop, stop a minute, George. I'd feel easier in my mind if you didn't actually throw it. Just, just go through the motions, eh. Yes sir. Right George. Oh! It's clear as daylight. Look, look George. You're letting it go too soon. Yes sir. No wait. Maybe it's too late. It er, it all depends on how you look at it. Yes sir. Mark you George, I know nothing about the hammer. No sir. Yet most things these days can be reduced to some sort of, mathematical formula. Yes sir. Here, Let me have a go George. You'll stand clear, won't you George? Yes sir. Just a matter of energy you know. Foot pounds and so forth. Now let me see. McNab! McNab! McNab. My dear fellow, I'm terribly sorry. Are you hurt? I don't think so. Thank goodness. You gave me a terrible fright, McNab. I'm sorry about that. No, I'm alright. Just. The laird was showing me how to throw the hammer Mr. McNab. Come, come, come, George. No need to put it as strongly as that. I might have managed to steer my bike but my, thoughts were on the prospects of the salmon fishing, not on guided missiles, if guided is the word. What is this Geordie? You thinking of taking up the hammer, then? It was Mr. Samson's idea. He said it would suit me. You know Minister There's more in that thing than meets the eye. The point is to know when to let go before, before strangulation sets in. Look, I'll show you. Rhythm's the secret. It goes something like this, if you'll give me your attention. Now the hammer should climb up on your left and descend on the right. Gosh he can do it. One hundred and six feet, six inches. The best yet Geordie, and a real good throw. We'll leave it at that for this evening and you're coming along fine. It's thanks to you Mr. McNab, if I've got better. By the way Geordie, Saturday fortnight's the Dunfechin Games. Is that a fact? Another throw like that and you'd win the hammer easy. I'm not keen on competitions as competitions, Mr. McNab. Why? Where's the harm in them? Where's the use in them? Oh, I'd like fine to see you beat some of those big police fellas. What for would I throw against other chaps? Isn't there more sense in that than throwing on your own? I like fine to do it well. I don't care on how other folks does it. Oh Geordie, need you be so stiff-necked? Isn't the whole glory of sport in the pitting of manly strength and skill, one against the other? Maybe. There's Jean. Jean! Well, I'll be getting away back to the manse. You're the sort that's got to make up your own mind. See you Thursday practice, and let me know your decision. Well I'm, no very keen. Think it over just the same. So long Mr. McNab. So long Geordie. Jean! Come on Mick. There's a good dog. Off you go. - Hello Jean. - Hello Geordie. How's the biceps and the triceps? How's the dorsals and the diaphragm? What's wrong with you lately Jean? Nothing's wrong with me. What could be wrong with me? Hi! Mick. You was different when Dad was taken ill. Well maybe I thought you'd start leaving your muscles alone then. Maybe I will, when the course is done. It's a rare waste of time spending every evening hurling a hammer. The minister doesn't think that. And where does the minister think it'll get you? You may laugh, Jean Donaldson, but the minister wants me to throw in the Games. What? Aye, he'd like fine to see me beat some of those big police fellas. What's the sense of it? Well, is it not more sense than just throwing on my own? Is it? Why is it? Well er... There's the glory of sport with pitting yourself against the other chaps' performance. You've been listening to the minister. I'm the sort to make my own mind up. And have you? Aye, I have. It's a long time since I went with wee Geordie to look at that eagles' nest. 'Tis that. That day's got a lot to answer for. I'm wondering where it's going to stop. I'm wondering if it's ever going to stop. This is one year I'll be giving Dunfechin Games the miss. Come on Mick. There. Five inches I've let down. Oh. Mum do I have to wear the kilt? It was your father's Black Watch kilt he left you specially. He'd be so pleased to think of you winning in it at Dunfechin. Aye. Maybe he'd not be so pleased if I don't. That's no way to be talking. There, it fits you fine now. Why did I enter the Games anyway? I can't think what came over me. Now here's Ian just making another attempt. Oh ho, well done. A magnificent effort. And the winning one... Now back to the hammer-throwing. Tom McCannon has just thrown 106 feet with his second throw. And here comes Andrew Frazer for his second throw. Frazer's first throw, if you remember, was 107 feet. Andrew Frazer has just thrown 108 feet, six inches. What did he say? I don't know. Police Sergeant Cameron, coming up for his second throw. He's a braw fella. Cameron's in great form. I wonder if he can beat the record-breaking throw he made at Mulgay. Oh, beautifully thrown hammer. Beats his first throw by several feet. It's a nice sporting gesture to clap your opponent but, you don't need to tire yourself out at it. Now it's number ten. Geordie McTaggart again. Good luck. As I said earlier, it's McTaggart's first appearance here. As some of you may have noticed, McTaggart's throw was slightly outside the throwing area and as his first throw was also disqualified, that means that McTaggart has not yet left the starting gate. That's not funny. Number one now makes his third and last throw. Trooper Lithgo of Aberdeen. Bad luck Geordie. Lithgo's best throw so far has been 108 feet. You let the hammer take charge of you Geordie. Aye, it was bad. Number one has beaten his earlier throw of 109 feet. Now here comes PC Roth of the Dundee Police again. Roth will be doing well if he can beat Cameron. You can beat them still Geordie. Cameron's your only danger. I've made a big mistake. Now, now Geordie. Anyone can throw a bad shot or two. It's no the mistake I mean. Excuse me a moment please. A very nice throw, but not up to Cameron's I think. Hello Mr. Donaldson. Good day to you Geordie. How's the show? I observe a slight improvement over last year. Will you give a message to Jean please? Except maybe for the scarlet runners. Hmm? When, when you get home, will you tell Jean, she was right. She was right. Is that all? Aye. I see. She was right. Thanks Mr. Donaldson. You're welcome. Now here comes Cameron again for his final throw. Will he beat his previous mark? It doesn't much matter if he does or not. His last throw is still the winning one. Oh, a magnificent one. The best yet so far. He's beaten his own mark by several feet. Only McTaggart left to throw now. Don't think of the others this time. Just try and throw a good one. Good luck. Cameron's throw was 118 feet. I'm afraid there's little hope of McTaggart beating Cameron. Hello Andy. Hello sir. How are you Fergusson? What's the matter with the lad, McNab? Oh I wish I knew. I'm afraid he's sadly lacking in the competitive instinct. Come on now Geordie! Come away, my wee Geordie! Jean? Yes Geordie. What for did you want me to win? What for would I want to see any lad from the glen beaten by a barrel-bodied, fat-headed copper from Glasgow? But why not? Wasn't it you who said there was no sense in it anyway? And there's no sense in my being cross-examined in the middle of the loch with a storm coming on. I'm thinking it'll just get the shore. I'm not saying this isn't a fine silver cup, mind. Och, what's the use of talking? Women's the same the world over. Here comes the storm. Where's your mac? By your feet. Och, women. Here you are then. Alright Geordie. Take the cup, will you? What your laughing at? Maybe it's because I'm happy. Och, Jean. What Geordie? When I heard your whistle and call, "Come away, my wee Geordie," my heart gave a big lift inside me and I felt I could throw the hammer to kingdom come. Maybe that's the best place for it. Hey! Are you aware that was a kestrel you shot? Yes sir, I know that fine. Then why the devil did you shoot it? It's been killing the chickens. What? Am I deluding myself in thinking that I told you, and your father before you time and time again that hawks, and particularly kestrels, are absolutely harmless to game and to poultry? No sir. What the blazes do you mean no sir? No sir, you're not deluding yourself. Oh I see. I saw a kestrel come down and pick up a chicken. Nonsense, I had my glasses on it. There was nothing in its claws. It had dropped it already. Rubbish. Well here's the chicken that the kestrel dropped. Are you certain George? Aye sir. I am. Hello, McNab, I didn't see you. How are you? What can I do for you? Mr. Harley, Mr. Rawlins from England. How do you do? And this is the lad himself, Geordie McTaggart. Geordie, Mr. Harley and Mr. Rawlins from England. How do you do? - How do you do? - I'm fine. I was just wondering if they could see the champion of Dunfechin throw the hammer? Oh, it's up to George. I'm busy with the chicks. What's left of 'em. You've a clear flight lochwards. It's the international hammer. He's had some practice with it but not a lot. Full strength? Aye, full strength. After what I told the laird, will he no let me shoot the kestrels that are killing the chickens? No by George, George. I won't have that. No by George, I won't, George! Then come Christmas there'll be no eggs for breakfast. Rawlins! That must be 180 feet. In his gumboots. Didn't I tell you? And him little more than a stranger to the international hammer. - But it's fantastic. - It's blood... it's stupendous. - We'd better talk to him. - We had. Geordie! George, just because one untypical bird has a bad family history. They've all got a bad family history. Geordie, these gentlemen are two of the selectors from the British Olympic Games team. What? You know the Olympics are being held this year? Yes Geordie, the athletics championship of the world, in Melbourne. Is that a fact? We'd like to invite you to join the team. Good gracious me. Isn't it great Geordie. You'll be sailing for Australia in the autumn. Australia? You see being antipodes, when it's winter here, it's summer there. I ken that. Clot! You understand what they're asking you to do, George? I canna spare the time. He canna spare the time? Oh, come, come, come, come now, George. You've just got to spare it. I mean er, I mean, you can't possibly afford to miss a great opportunity like this. Oh. But it's a great honor to throw the hammer for England. What for would I throw the hammer for England? He means Britain. Och, there's my duties, the, the deer forests and the loch. The vermin to kill and such like. Yeah, your Uncle Jim can take over temporarily. He knows about chickens too, George. Aye, my Uncle Jim'd soon sort the laird's kestrels. No by George, he wouldn't. Well somebody's gotta do it. This is becoming an obsession, George. The facts must be faced. - Not facts George. Fiction. - Facts. For the last time, kestrels are... You know, I'm sick to death of the blasted birds. Come on, let's all go in and have a drink. Now he's talking. Shut up, shut up. It certainly took some persuading. Hmm. Two bottles. I'm not sure we haven't bitten off a bit more than we could chew with that lad. Is that a fact? Do you remember the last time we came up here? I was maybe the smallest boy in the county. And now you're the biggest man. Aye. Oh look! There's the eagle! Jean. You've only to say the word and I'll no go. I know that Geordie, but the whole of Scotland's proud of ye. Who says that? The Dunfechin Clarion. Och, it's got to say something. It only comes out every other Tuesday. I'm proud of you too Geordie. You're not, Jean. I'm fair bursting with pride. I know it's daft but I canna help it. Oh Jean. Come back to me Geordie. Just come back to me. That's all I'm caring. I will Jean. I'll come back to you. My dear lad, I set my pen to paper with a lump in my throat at the great news. What a wonderful thing we have achieved together. Who could have thought that one day we should represent Great Britain in the Olympic Games, and all done by correspondence. Rain or shine, I'll be at the docks to shake you by the hand at last and wish you good luck and Godspeed. Goodbye then wee Geordie and good luck. As you are George. Goodbye sir. Get inside now Geordie. You're sure you have your London ticket? Aye Mum. Goodbye Jean. Goodbye Geordie. Now don't forget to wear your Black Watch kilt. No Ma. And don't leave off your underwear until it's really hot. No Ma. Now we'll all miss you Geordie, including the kestrels. Thank you sir. And be a good lad. Aye Ma. I've a mind to say a short prayer. I wish you would, sir. Yes, yes. Fire away, Minister. Oh Lord, we humbly beseech thee that if it please thee to give our good friend, Geordie McTaggart, thy strength and courage, that he may have a quiet mind through all changes of fortune. Preserve him across the seas from all temptations and send him safe home the same good, simple lad, that sets out. Amen. Amen. Goodbye George. Be a good lad. George... Bye George. - All present and correct? - Just about. Got the Scot's dreadnought in tow? Somewhere. Nearly lost him at Kings Cross when he started up the down escalator. Actually made it too, by gosh. - Morning Mr. Rawlins. - Morning. Has anybody asked for me? No. Were you expecting someone? Aye. Watch where he settles. He'll be on a cargo boat for China if we're not careful. Yeah. Geordie! Geordie! - Geordie! - Hello Mr. Samson. Geordie my boy. My dear, good fella. I say. Mind where you're going, can't you? So, we meet at last Geordie. Yes Mr. Samson. Oh it does me heart good just to look at you. You're a credit to me, me boy. McTaggart, you're wanted in customs. Stand aside my man. No customs examination is going to rob me of this moment. What about a picture McTaggart? Oh is this your father? Father? My friends, I've been more than a father to him. I'm Henry Samson, the originator of the world famous Physical Culture Course. Geordie's me pupil. Eh, I'm proud of this lad, gentlemen. Together, by a fusion of wills we've turned a seven stone weakling into this perfect physical specimen you see before you, and all by correspondence. Mr. Samson, would you and Mr. McTaggart care to give the newsreel some idea of your great strength? Indeed yes. How can we afford to let such an opportunity slip? Ah yes. Come Geordie. Come on Geordie. You take that end. When I say the word, lift. You ready? Alley-oop! Goodbye Geordie. Good luck. Bless you me boy. What are you doing there Geordie? The others are all hard at it. You can't expect to keep in trim lounging around, you know. Feeling alright, aren't you? I've been thinking on the glen. I beg your pardon. I've come a long way from home in the last few days Mr. Rawlins, and I wish I hadna. Oh come now. You mustn't talk like that. We all feel a bit homesick at first. I've never left home before. I've never been further than Perth, and I dinna like Perth. My dear fella, don't think I don't understand. I felt exactly the same the first time I left Muswell Hill. But I got over it and so will you. Come along now, there's a good chap. You'll need to put in all the time you can on your footwork, McTaggart. It's pretty shaky at present. I don't wonder, he didn't eat any breakfast. I don't think our problem boy will take much lunch either. Better lead him to it all the same. Right. - Lunch time Geordie. - Aye. I'm awful sorry. That is quite alright. Oh hello Helga. Come on Geordie. Oh Dickie? Yes Helga. Who is the big boy? That's McTaggart. The hammer-thrower from darkest Scotland. Really? You should have introduced us. Now listen duckie, we've got enough trouble with him now without inviting any more. I don't want any pudding thanks. This will never do, you know Geordie. You can't go skipping your food like this. I'm no very hungry. Hello Bill. Oh hello. Please do not get up. You know everybody, don't you? Except Geordie McTaggart. This is Helga Svenson, the Danish lady shot-putter. How do you do? I'm fine. You are from Scotland I hear. I have a friend in Scotland who sent me some white heather for luck. Someday I will go to Scotland. It's a primitive country. I am primitive too Bill. Goodbye Geordie. Bye, bye boys. The only heather she knows anything about is the come hither. Oh really Harley. I think I'll go on deck and write a couple of letters if you don't mind. Hello. May I sit down a moment please? Aye, if you like. That was Kersen of Denmark. You will be throwing the hammer against him. Is that a fact? The other man is Van Raun. He throws for Holland. Oh dear. All they can talk about is throwing the hammer. But I forget, perhaps you like to talk about throwing the hammer too. I'm not very fond of the hammer at present. Well, it's a rather limited subject for conversation of course, especially when we've the whole world stretched before us like this. I do not care for the world either. I'd rather be at home. You have, a girlfriend in Scotland? Aye. What is her name? Jean. She's a lucky girl. Tell me about her Geordie. Is she pretty? Aye, she's braw. Braw? What is that? Braw? Well, it's er, grand. Oh. Who is she? She's Mr. Donaldson's daughter. He's the head gardener at the laird's house. I work for the laird too. Do you? What do you do? I'm a gamekeeper. Jean and I have known each other all our lives... but you don't want to know about that. I do. I would like to hear all about you and your Scotland, and your Jean. It makes me feel less lonely. That's funny. It makes me feel less lonely too. Does it? Then tell me all about everything and I'll just lay back here all afternoon and listen. Nice girl, Helga, Mr. Rawlins. Yes, the Danish and Dutch teams seem to think so, too. And the Norwegians, Swedish and French. It's nice to be popular like that. It has been a wonderful voyage for me Geordie. You made it alright for me too Helga. Have I? Aye. You understand me better than any girl I've ever met. Do I? Except Jean of course. Of course. I've only ever met two girls I've really liked. You and Jean. I have known many men I am afraid, but I've only ever known one I really liked. I don't have to say any more, do I? Time for bed Geordie my boy. We're docking at the crack of dawn. Right Mr. Rawlins. Good night Helga. See you tomorrow. Good night Geordie. Saved by the gong, I fancy. Good night Helga. The Aussies are blunt, you know. They say what they think. Aye, we say what we think in Scotland too. Good. Well you ought to feel at home here. Anyway, you'll be together with the rest of the team. You won't be mixing much with the, other competitors now. All you've got to do is concentrate on the job. What on earth have you got there? It's my dad's Black Watch kilt. You brought it all the way from Scotland? - Aye. - Whatever for? I promised Mum I'd wear it. - When? - In the Games of course. Now look, my dear chap. Why do you think we brought you that blazer and flannels? I dinna ken. Because the whole British team will be wearing them. Fine crowd we'd look in the parade if everybody turned up wearing any old rig-out. The kilt's not any old rig-out. It's the Scottish national dress. Well I'll doubt if the Committee will see it that way. I'm not caring how the Committee sees it. I'm wearing my kilt. Now look Geordie. Be a good fellow. You can't disrupt the whole organization like this. If you insist on the kilt, I shall have to speak to Lord Paunceton, he'll have to put it to the Committee, and they'll have to take it up with the DOA in London. I canna help that. I've given my word. I'll no go back on it. Where are you off to now? I'm going to take a wee look round Melbourne. Hello Geordie. Hello Helga. Are you nervous about tomorrow Geordie? Aye. You will win. I know you will. I don't think so. You must. You must beat that Kersen. I shall wish it with all my heart. Your own Danish chap? Do you no want him to win? I should. I know I should but I cannot Geordie. It is you I want to win. Och. They've got some lovely hats here, haven't they? What do you think of that one? Which one? The, the one with the fruit and the flowers on it. Oh Geordie, what can I say? I was thinking maybe I'd get it for Jean. It'd be just right for the spring when I get back. Are you sure it would suit her? Och aye. It's a braw hat. I'll just see how much it costs. Helga. It's me, Bill. Look, I'm sorry to butt in and all that but after all, it's my job. What is your job Bill? You know very well. I saw you leave the camp with McTaggart. The Games open tomorrow. Is not McTaggart allowed to walk around Melbourne with me in the afternoon? Now look Helga. I saw what went on on the ship. Geordie McTaggart's a raw youth from the backwoods. A little more encouragement from you and he'll be as much use to Britain as a hammer-thrower as I'd be. Bill! You are a stupid, stupid man. All you know about is running and jumping and muscles. You do not understand human beings at all. Geordie is a simple, honest, decent lad with a big, kind heart that is bigger than him. And you come here with your mean, nasty, suspicious mind. Now look Helga. Let's not have a scene here. Ha! There's somebody under it! Right, lift. Lift. I can't move it. - Nor can I. - Here. Let me try. Keep back, keep back. Stand back. See if you can drag him out. Hurry, hurry, quick, hurry. Okay Geordie. Oh Geordie, you were wonderful. Do you think he'll be alright? He's hurt his legs but I think that's all. Let's get along before there's any fuss. That's him. Excuse me. I represent the Melbourne Sun. Did you really lift that car on your own? Yes, he did. Can I have your name? You here for the Games? For them. He's in them. He's Geordie McTaggart. He's throwing the hammer for England. Scotland. Britain. Is that all, young man? - Oh heck no. - Just a minute Charlie. Well I want your entire background. Who your mother was, your weight, your height, your grandmother. My grandmother? What's he talking about Mr. Rawlins? Argus, Argus. Olympic athlete sensation. Argus, Argus. Olympic athlete sensation. Argus, Argus... It is now approaching three o'clock, and the grand parade of the athletes of all nations is about to begin. Excuse me sir. May I have a word with you Lord Paunceton? What is it my boy? Well no cable's arrived from England sir, and McTaggart's putting on his kilt. But he can't do that. Haven't you told him? We've argued ourselves blue sir. You want me to come and speak to him I suppose? Well sir... Oh very well, if you think so. What an absurd situation. It'd have been far better off if they'd chosen that fella from Surrey. Couldn't throw so far, sir. He wore trousers. Oh. You can call it what you like, McTaggart. I call it sheer obstinacy. Oh hello McTaggart. How are you feeling? I'm not feeling good sir. Oh. Well you shouldn't go lifting cars around, you know. Now. Now about this kilt. I've had no reply yet to the cable I sent to London. - No sir. - No. I really feel under the circumstances you should well, leave it off. His Lordship means you should wear the flannels. I promised my mother I'd wear the kilt sir. Yes I, I know but if your mother was here, I'm sure she'd understand. She's not here sir. Well I'm aware of that. My dad wouldn't have liked it either. What's his father got to do with it? It was his kilt sir. Oh. Well how many more of the family are involved in this? Now look here McTaggart. The position is simply this: I mean without the consent of London, I can't possibly give my permission. I'm sorry. I'm sorry sir, too. Hmm? Well I'm very glad you see it that way. Very glad. I don't know what you fellas are making all this fuss about? It's just that I promised my mother. Huh? And it's no kilt, no performance. Well now look McTaggart, this is childish. It's ridiculous. What are we to do? Well sir. I don't think it's going to cause an international incident, is it? Well you mean, let him wear it? Yes. Well I mean, of course if these fellas back home just sit on the cables have only got themselves to blame, haven't they? Definitely sir. Well I shall say so in no uncertain terms. Good for you sir. Will the British team please stand by for the parade. Well er, good luck. - Best of luck everybody. - Thank you sir. Any other troubles Rawlins, just let me know. I'll be around. There he is! I'm sorry my Lord. This cable has just arrived, marked urgent. Oh thank you. ...Wilfred Thomas reporting to you from the Olympic Stadium, Melbourne, on this blazing summer afternoon. It really has been wonderful weather here these past few days. And with three Olympic records and two world records smashed, it's been a very exciting time. Now to bring you up to date. The final of the hammer-throwing began at two o'clock and the six qualifiers are now completing their second round. Galov of Russia leads with a throw of 206 feet, with young Geordie McTaggart, the gentle giant from Scotland who picks up automobiles single-handed, bottom of the list, after only just managing to qualify this morning. Now here is Kersen of Denmark to make his second throw. Kersen's first throw was 205 feet three inches, just nine inches shorter than Galov's. Hey, that, that was a great throw. I, I think he's beaten Galov's mark. We shall know in a few seconds. You've got to forget everything Geordie, except that hammer. That's right. Concentrate. Here comes Geordie McTaggart again for his second throw. The crowd has taken this huge Scot to their hearts. They applaud this boy on the slightest provocation, and if a throw doesn't come off, they will shout with disappointment. Well he's now reached the nets. What a reception. And what an inspiration it must be to a young, inexperienced athlete like McTaggart, knowing that the whole crowd is rooting for him. Ah. I'm afraid that was something of a disaster. Oh Geordie. McTaggart is certainly having no luck here today. His second throw, went into the net. Oh Geordie. Kersen of Denmark threw 219 feet six inches. Maybe if we recited some Burns, it might rouse him. The only line of Burns I know is "the best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft a-gley." Ah, they've done that alright. McTaggart is now leaving the nets. And there's Helga Svenson, the famous Danish athlete, having a word of sympathy with him. Now this boy is very popular with the other competitors. Who's Helga Svenson? European lady champion shot-putter. Lady champion shot... I suppose they call that progress. Well he'll need to do better than that this time. Van Raun of Holland is now making his second throw. Next time Geordie. Aye. Ah, I'm afraid that was a good deal... Maybe those two will empty the stadium or something. Do not worry about the crowd. Maybe he's not feeling very well. In his letters to me, he says he feels great. What does the laird think? The laird thinks, that a wee drop of whisky in our tea might put the situation in a better light. He still has another throw. With competition reaching its climax, Kersen of Denmark still leads, 209 feet six inches, followed by Galov of Russia and Sherman of the United States level-pegging it at 207 feet. Sherman of USA is now making his third and final throw. Oh very nice indeed. Only just short of the leading mark. Here comes Kersen of Denmark again. He's looking very confident. And rightly so. I don't think anyone here will beat him this afternoon. He's making his third and final throw now. What a lovely action this man has. A wonderful throw. He's beaten his previous mark by a handsome margin. That must be over 210 feet. We shall know in a minute. We can beat it Geordie. We can beat the world! Yes, that was a record. Kersen's throw was an Olympic record. Two hundred and twelve feet. Two hundred and twelve feet. ...nobody's likely to beat Kersen. McTaggart of Britain is next. You'll do better this time Geordie. I dinna think it. It's not the same here as Scotland. That's a fact. Of course it isn't. The sun's shining for one thing. It's not only the weather that's missing. It's everything. The lochs, the heather, the mist on the mountains. Tell you the truth Mr. Rawlins, I'm no in my element. I feel different. He's walking to the net now but I'm afraid he's facing a hopeless task. Something seems to have upset this lad this afternoon. What a pity he couldn't find his form. If wishful thinking counted for anything, the crowd here today would certainly have willed him into winning. But even if his last throw's an outstanding one, I don't think it can possibly be good enough to beat Kersen's. I shouldn't be praying for a thing like this but I... just can't help it. He's waiting. It seems as if he's waiting for the crowd to quieten. Come on now Geordie. Come away Geordie! Come away, my wee Geordie! Now he's swinging. Well, this looks more like it. He's going into his turns easily, smoothly. It's gone. It's sailing through the air now. It's a tremendous throw. It's terrific, it's lovely, it's perfect, it's a fine... It's falling, it's falling. He's won! He's won! He's won! Whoopee! That's the last. That's the last I'll ever throw. Two hundred and twenty-one feet. A new Australian, Olympic and world record. Geordie, Geordie! A girl's got to him first. It's Helga Svenson. She's in his arms. They're kissing. Oh, what a sight. It's beautiful to see. It's a union of giants. They're still kissing. They're a magnificent couple. She's a lovely creature. The same girl who was with him when he lifted the car. They're still embracing. The crowd's going mad. I've never seen anything like it. They're leaving the stands now and streaming across the arena. Now they've picked McTaggart up. They're carrying him. They're carrying her, too. The crowd's all over the arena. There they go now. This magnificent hunk of Celtic manhood, and that gorgeous specimen of blonde Nordic muscular femininity. Oh Geordie. My wee Geordie. Och, it's great having you back, and looking so well, and being the champion of the world too. You're looking fine yourself, Mum. Where's Jean? Och, it's great having you back for the first breath of spring. Didn't no one else come? Well yes, yes. Mr. Macrimmon's in the yard. The carrier, you know, waiting to drive us home. We mustn't keep him waiting. Hello Mr. Macrimmon. The train was 12 minutes late, Mr. Macrimmon. You keeping well? You can put his bag and his box in the back, Mrs. McTaggart. You can put your suitcase and the hatbox in the back dear. Mother, what's this all about? Well now, it's just a bit notion that's got abroad that you've brought shame on the glen. Me? Shame? Och it's not a thing to be talking about with nothing in your stomach. Good afternoon, Mrs. McTaggart. Good afternoon sir. Welcome home George. Well my boy, and what do you think of the world, eh? I'm glad to be back sir. Good, good for you George. Eh, Mrs. McTaggart, I was wondering if I could be begging a lift, just to the, just to the top of the hill there? Why certainly sir. Jump in. Thank you Mrs. McTaggart. Thank you George. By the way George, congratulations on your great Olympic victory. Thank you sir. Would you mind telling me sir, why there was no one at the station? Why's everybody turning their back on me? You mean your mother hasn't... My mother won't say. Oh come, come, Mrs. McTaggart, there's no sense in keeping it from the lad. Well I'm not wanting Joe Macrimmon spilling our private troubles around the pubs. I never spill anything in pubs, Mrs. McTaggart. Quite right too Macrimmon. Well you see George, they all heard it on the wireless from Australia. Everything. So that's it. Impassioned account of one Geordie McTaggart, wildly embracing a Scandinavian female shot-putter, whose name at the moment escapes me. Helga. Helga. I always thought they were a cold-blooded race, George. It wasna me that started it sir. Really? She was that keen. I'm sorry George, but you see, the commentator didn't exactly give the impression that it was one-sided. Jean didn't even come to meet me. Well she feels badly about it, in front of all those people. I was wearing my kilt too. Well now there's no need to get morbid about it, my boy. What can I say to her sir? Well if I were you George, I'd just go straight up to her and, make a manly apology to the lady. Tell her that you just kissed, the first thing that came to hand in the heat of the moment. You just happened to be lucky. Do you think that'll do it sir? It might, yes it might. Oh by the way I saw her. Yes I saw her. I saw her down by the trout stream about half an hour ago. You, you did? Stop! Stop, Mr. Macrimmon! Mum do you mind if I slip away for a wee while? I'll be back in time for supper. You'd better be. I've got something special. Can I have my hatbox please? You'll not get round her by bribery. It depends on the hat. Can we see it George? Aye. It's a braw hat, is it no? It's stupendous George. I like it fine. Hello. Can I sit down? I canna stop you. What's the bait? Wasp maggots. So you won. Aye. I won. What's the next championship you'll be after? That's the last. I've done wi' all yon havers. Havers? Aye, havers. Exercises, balance development and the rest. The whole thing's daft. Gets you nowhere. It got you a beautiful blonde Danish girl. Och. I couldn't help it Jean. She took a jump at me and before I knew it we was all tied up there in public. I heard. A union of giants, he said. Beautiful to see, he said. They be kissing, he said. I wish you could see them. I could see you right enough. Cuddle, cuddle, cuddle and afore the crowd. It was only afore the crowd. Only afore the crowd. That's just it. With the whole glen listening on the wireless and, having a good laugh at me. I'm sorry Jean. Never signified nothing. You wouldna be pleased if I'd been off in the woods and bushes with her, would you? I'm past caring. I was thinking of you when I kissed her. That's the last straw. That's the finish. And let me tell you, I was not thinking of you when I was out with Jock McKechnie last week. What was you doing with Jock McKechnie? Why wouldn't I go with Jock McKechnie? Why wouldn't I get a kiss? Because you belong to me, that's why. Because I'm the only one who's the right to kiss you. Oh! Oh... Are you no sorry, my wee Jean? No I'm not! Then I'll leave you. You wouldn't. You wouldn't dare! Would I not? No Geordie. No! Get me out! I never let Jock McKechnie kiss me. Did you not? You, you should have known that, Geordie. Geordie darling. Jean. I've a hat for you. A hat? Aye. I bought it special in Melbourne. You could wear it to the kirk. Geordie. Let me see. Do you no think it's braw? Braw, my poor wee Geordie. It's the bonniest hat I ever saw. Put it on then.
