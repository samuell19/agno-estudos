Subtitles by explosiveskull Dick! Tom! Kane did find it. The stories are true. It killed him. Doesn't matter. Just wanna get the hell off this island. It's going to work quite well. Hey, well done, boys. Ah, it's good to be home. Some outdoorsman you are. You can't get premium scotch outdoors. So what's next? What about The Congo? There's a place with a Zaire River raft. Too fuckin' hot. Besides, we did that last month. We could go to Jersey. What's in Jersey? My ex-wife. Francine. Hello, Ryan. So good to see you. Where's... I need to talk to you. Everything okay? I have to talk to you. Of course. What's going on? It's Dylan. He's missing. How long's he been gone for? Three weeks now. You don't think he's still on vacation? He always sends me letters when he's on his hunts. They've stopped. Have you tried contacting the police? They could get out a search party or something. No, I can't do that. Dylan's reputation is too important to him. He'd kill me if I called the police. Francine, we don't have a whole lot of options here. No. Ryan, you're my only option. You and the other hunters and trackers that Dylan taught, you could find him and bring him back. Francine. We all know that a search party will take days. You can find him in no time. What does Gail think about this? Well, she's upset. You know how she is. She stormed out of my house when I told her. She's in town? She didn't tell you? She's been back a week now. Where'd he go? He said an island northeast of here. The Island of Hobbes? You know it? Yeah. He's been wanting to go there to disprove the monster. Ryan, he's been acting strange lately. He said he wanted a challenge. I'm afraid he might've taken something too far. Okay. I'll talk to the guys tonight. Oh thank you, Ryan. This means a lot, and please, don't let Gail go. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. How long's he been gone for? I've hardly noticed. He's been on plenty of these long trips before. How do we know he's not just taking his time? Been writing letters. A few weeks ago they stopped. Maybe he doesn't wanna be found. So wait, if he's missing why not just sent a search party? Unfortunately we can't- do that. A man who spends the majority of his life outdoors. Is lost. Yeah, not to mention the reputation of the lodge. And that's where we come in? Right. With your help we can find him. When are we planning on going? First light tomorrow. His last known location. And where is that exactly? Island of Hobbes. It's a hell of a place. It's where he went. Look, let's not forget who Kane is to this lodge and to every one of us. This guy taught us everything we know. So I'll say again, who's with me? Yeah. All right. I'm in. All right. Meet at Wayne County Airport at eight a.m. tomorrow. See ya then. You know as well as I do Kane doesn't just go missing. I know. See ya in the morning. Take care of him, all right? What are you doin' here? It's been awhile. I just wanted to see the lodge. It's good to see you again, Ryan. Yeah, we, uh... You wanna get a drink? Catch up? I'm actually heading downstairs. Yeah. Mind if I come down with you? Just like old times. The others, what about them? Cold'll preserve their bodies 'til we get back. And Peter? He's still out there. He's been dead. And we will be, too, if we don't get off this God forsaken island. How do expect to leave? We don't have any other options. Get some rest. I'll take first watch. Nice to see you kept this place mostly intact. How long has it been now? Two years? Four. Wow. What've you been up to? Traveling. Just got back from Greece. You? You're lookin' at it. Oh my God, is that the trip to The Congo? Gosh, remember that gamble you had with Dad? Three years, I'm still payin' that debt off. Yeah. Guess that's what happens when you challenge the world's greatest hunter, huh? He always liked his challenges. He does. Especially when trying to prove to superstitious locals that a stupid legend doesn't exist. That is a challenge. Yeah, on his adventures. So what was it this time? Some Indian legend about an island haunted by a monster, thirst for man flesh. Ah, the Beast of Hobbes. He would tell me that one as a girl. When I'd misbehave he'd tell me that the beast would come and scalp me. You believed that? I was six. You've been to every vacation and every family trip, did he ever mention me at all? All the time. Mostly about us getting hitched. Yeah. The look on his face when we called it off. Well, you were always his favorite. Come on, don't say that. We both know he wanted a son and you fit - the description perfectly. - Come on. He took you with us, didn't he? He loves you. Bagged him in Yosemite last month. Quite the specimen. Didn't go down without a fight either. Kind of reminded me of you actually. Ryan, take me with you. Please. Please. He's my father, I need to know. And he'll kill me for having you come to his rescue. I'm not a little girl anymore. I do not have to submit to his pride. It's about all he has left. Is this the only reason you came? Fine. When he tears me a new one, you better take the blame. Just like old times. Right. Hello? Mornin', sweetheart. Ryan? Wanted to wake you, but I figured you needed some beauty sleep. Get back here now. Look, I got a flight to catch. Don't worry, cleaning lady'll be downstairs soon. What? She knows where the key is. Ryan. Yeah, this isn't the first time this has happened. Ryan! Sorry, that's my flight. Gotta go, see ya in a week. Ryan! Mornin', gentlemen. Mornin'. How can I help? Didn't happen to rent a boat couple weeks back, older gentleman? Dylan Kane? Tall, older? Oh, I remember he come through here. I didn't have any boats for him so I pointed him to Joe. Who's Joe? He's a local fisherman, kind of a strange type if ya ask me. You know where we can find him? I don't know. I ain't seen him since. Well, like to rent a couple of your boats for the day. Doin' some fishin'? No. We're headin' to The Isle. Now why in the world do you wanna go there? Lookin' for our friend. Well, if he went there he ain't comin' back. Why is that? It's a dark place. Why do you think no one lives on there? No one even fishes near The Isle. Cursed? You never heard of the Beast of Hobbes? Sure. You believe in stories? It's real. Fishermen see him all the time. How can they see him if no one goes near the island? Look, just don't go out there. Beast or not, I'd like to rent a couple of your boats. You gonna help us out? Well I'm afraid I can't help you. I can't let you go out there knowin' I won't get my boats back. How much is this gonna take? How many'd you say you need? Just two. So that's the Island of Hobbes, huh? Why the hell'd the old bastard come out here? He was after the Beast of Hobbes. Really? The old man after a ghost story? Why hasn't he come back yet? Shouldn't you get some sleep? Can't. Cheerful spot, isn't it? Now what? We'll head north on the eastern shore, then head south on the western side. It's 96 square miles. Still 12 hours of daylight left. Lot of ground to cover. Had better get to it, then. It's so bloody thick I can barely see 20 feet in front of me. Reminds me of the Flatheads. At least it wasn't as cold down there. Hey, you all right? Don't tell me you're gettin' jumpy. Better to be on your toes. Wolves hunt all up and down this island. Moose out here, too. Moose? Once saw this man get near trampled to death by a moose up near Fairbanks. Guy has to drink his meals through a rubber hose. Christ. Well this keeps gettin' better and better. You hear that? What? Nothin'. It's quiet. So? Been like that since we got here. Maybe the Beast of Hobbes is nearby. How much ground have we covered? About eight miles. Eight miles? I thought it'd at least be 10. What's that? What do you think they are? Who cares, just keep movin'. Who do you think did this? Probably some kids tryin' to keep the legend alive. And these are part of the legend? Crafts the woods to trap the souls of men that he has killed. Thanks for that, Leonard. Hold up, I gotta stop. Why? I gotta go. Find a tree. Not that kind of go. Take a break. Hurry it up. Hello? Hello? Seriously. Al? Is that you? Where the hell is he? He had to go. 15 minutes? Howard, go find him. Why me? Oh fuck it, I'll go. Why would he leave his backpack? Dumb fuck must've got turned around in here. Peter! Peter! Peter! Peter! I'm sorry for earlier. I was just... You were right. I should've come here sooner. You didn't know. None of this is your fault. Peter! Peter! This is ridiculous. Where the hell is he? It's been over a bloody hour now and still no sign of him. I was right. We gotta get the hell out of here. And just leave him out here? He's fine. When he lost us, he probably went back to the fucking boats. He's right. He's got his survival skills like the rest of us. He'll be fine. Hey, fellas! They're tracks. Well? Peter? Can't be, these tracks are at least a day old. Is it Kane's? Hard to tell. They're goin' north. Let's move. What the hell is that? It's too hard to tell. The tracks are too old. Guys. What the hell happened here? Who could've done this? Looks like some sort of last stand. Against what? What, is it Kane? No. It's Joe the fisherman. Then where's Kane? Here. Oh God, look at him. What could've done that? Wolves? No. Then what? I don't know. What would just rip him up like that? Cover him for Christ's sake. It was stupid of him to come out here without us. What could've done that to him? You get that feelin', too? Yeah, since we got to shore. I need a bloody breather. Take five. So what's next? When we get back we'll give him a proper burial. He shouldn't have come out here in the first place. Howard. What is it? It's Peter. Help! What the hell happened? Is he breathing? I can't see. Do something. Do something! Howard! What happened? Tom. He stepped and it came outta nowhere. What the hell is that? It's a trip wire. He used Peter's hat as bait. There's no one else out here that coulda done that. What the hell was that? Come on, pick him up. Let's get outta here. We only brought the one stretcher. Well what do we do? We can't carry them both. Well we can't just leave him out here. We won't. We take Kane. We'll leave his body by the boats, come back for Howard. You're kidding, right? What if the same thing that found Kane finds him? We don't have a choice. We're not too far off. We'll make it quick. Tom, make a mark. We have about three hours of daylight left and it's only gonna get colder. All of this is my fault. It wasn't your fault. Yeah, I know. That was an Apache design. I know. Not a whole lot of people know how to do that. Was it an old trap of Kane's? Couldn't have been. Used Peter's hat to lure us in. Not to mention it was set for a man's height. Why would Kane be setting a trap for a man? Maybe he was using it against us? You son of a bitch. How dare you! - Gail. - First you chain me to your bed half naked. Gail! And then you make me fly out here all by myself. Can it wait? Gail. Hold her. We have to wait. Wait for his voice. Gail. Leave me alone. Just fuck off. Gail. Gail. How could this happen? Oh shit. Don't know. You don't know? Just fix it, just fucking fix it. We gotta get back to the others. No! Just... We need to go. Peter's missing. Howard's dead. We need to get back to shore. This is all your fault. We're losin' daylight. Tom, give me a hand with this. Let's get going. Dick! It scalped him. What do we do? Cut him down. Tom! Aw geez. What was it? George! I don't know. I don't know what I saw. How the hell did he get to Dick and Tom so fast? Let's get out of here. We can't leave the bodies. Screw them! We can't just leave 'em here. Who the hell cares? They're dead. Leave the bodies! We aren't leaving my father. Everyone calm down. Calm? You want me to fucking calm down? We'll be killed one by fucking one! It shouldn't be a discussion! - Al! - No you can't! Get off me. This is not about you, Al, right now. Okay? I suppose it's about you, then. It's not about me either. It's about all of us. Your father and your whole damn family. Don't bring my father into this. Ever since I... Same thing that made the tracks with Kane. What is this? Toes. It has feet. It's a man. Stride's too long. It's too fast to be a man. What the hell are you doing? Let's get back to the fucking boats like normal people - and get off this island! - Just stop. Shut the fuck up. George, Do you know what you saw? Couldn't see its face. It was standing on two legs. It had fur, horns. That's it. That's it. Let's at least grab Kane's body. Let's grab the stretcher and head back. What about the others? We'll come back. Let's get going. I'll come. Just go. I'll come, just fucking go. It's a man doing this. It's not a man. Animals don't set traps or scalp people. It's not a man. This thing's big. It's got thick black hair, bones coverin' its face. We're not dealing with anything human here. What the hell is that? Is that smoke? Fire! Your father, Tom, Dick. Ryan, you should really get some sleep. I'm not letting anyone else go, Gail. Depriving yourself of sleep isn't gonna help anything. You need to be alert tomorrow. Like I was today? Tomorrow will be different. It burned the boats. What do we do now? We just fucking swim for it. It's near freezing out here. You wouldn't even last five minutes. We aren't going back into that forest. Gail, where's your boat? I don't have one. I got a local fisherman to drop me off. Great, that's just great. We'll camp here. Wait until morning so we can... Brilliant plan, Ryan. Why don't we ring the goddamn dinner bell while we're at it? You have a better plan, Al? We should move back into the treeline. We're too open out here. - What? - Leonard's right. This thing is hunting us. We have to start thinking preventive. Okay. Then we move back into the woods, set up camp, wait out the night. Kane did find it. The stories are true. It killed him. Doesn't matter. Just gotta get the hell off this island. The others, what about them? Cold'll preserve their bodies 'til we get back. And Peter? He's still out there. He's been dead. And we will be, too, if we don't get off this God forsaken island. And how do you expect to leave? I don't have any other options. Get some rest. I'm gonna take first watch. You should get some sleep. Can't. I'm sorry for earlier. I was just... You were right. I should've come here sooner. You didn't know. None of this is your fault. All of this is my fault. Your father, Tom, Dick. Ryan, you should really get some sleep. I'm not letting anyone else go, Gail. Depriving yourself of sleep isn't gonna help anything. You need to be alert tomorrow. Like I was today? Tomorrow'll be different. I need you. Your shift's over. You should get some sleep. I'll take it 'til morning. Go on. How'd it beat you? What would Kane do? He'd hunt back. Wake George up, would you? Like now. We gotta get movin'. Right. Get up. Get up. Asshole. Oh God, oh shit. Someone. He had to come in here and kill George. There's no way it came in without me knowin'. It had its chances with all of us. Why just him? Must've wanted him after Tom. Then why not kill us? Wouldn't be smart. Kill us all at once? That's not what it wants. Fuck this. I'm done. Where are you going? What does it look like I'm doing? You'll die of hypothermia before 20 feet. I'll take my chances. Just stop! What the hell's wrong with you? We stick together. I'm done. I'm not going back in those woods to be hunted. We're not. You happen to have a plan? We're going to hunt back. What if his plan doesn't work? We've got to get out of here. We wait here until Ryan comes back. Did you hear that? Get ready. We have to run. Stay. Oh shit. Jesus. What happened? I was right in front of it. Where's Leonard? Al ran off. Leonard went off after him. Damn it. Get up. I'm so sorry. Shit. I'll be okay. Shit. Oh gosh. Dad? Run. Run! For God sakes, you're better than this, Ryan. Kane. You still like rabbit stew? What are you doing? Dinner. All that time it was you. I saw you at the camp. I saw you torn to pieces. You're a clever one, then. Hard to believe you didn't catch on. You killed them. I did. They were your friends. Yes they were. Why? Because they were my friends. You're insane. No, you have a right to hate me. You have a right. You have a right not to believe this. And you have a right not to understand. You have a right to kill me, but you haven't earned the right to judge me. You shot Gail. You killed her. Yes, I did. How could you do that? I had to, Ryan. Now I can kill anyone. Then why am I still alive? Why didn't you kill me? Because I think you understand. You left her. You didn't even stop to see if she was okay. You had a chance to save her but you chose to save yourself, to survive. You're not Ryan the coward, you're Ryan the living. Welcome to bein' alive. How's it feel? Are you proud of that instinct? No. I didn't kill her. I didn't kill anyone. I would've left her. Why do we hunt a bear instead of a rabbit? Why do we build skyscrapers instead of huts? I'm capable of the great and terrible. I'm not burdened with complacency and acceptance of satisfaction. You're just a madman in the woods. Both of us are, Ryan. Both of us are alive. And you can still win. Leonard outweighed me by 35 pounds. He was the best tracker I'd ever seen. But animals don't set traps and he hunted me like I was an animal. You all did. That was your mistake. Well this is the last conversation we'll ever have. Tomorrow there will be no conversation. Tomorrow we will hunt and you will win or you will die. And if you choose to hunt me like an animal, you'll lose. No! You told me it was a setup. Sit down. The wife is here. She wants to talk to you if you feel up to it. Oh Ryan, oh Ryan. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Oh my God, look at you. Come here, sit down. This whole thing is so terrible. I can't believe... How are you doing? I'm fine. I just, I need some time. To come back from something like that must have been horrible. At least you're safe now. Shouldn't even be here. Should've been Gail who came back. Did she, did she say anything before? No. It happened too fast. I couldn't... She didn't feel anything. It was painless. And Dylan? Did he say why he did this? I can't. Please. I need this. He just snapped. He was confused. I had to put him out of it. I had to make him stop. It's okay, Ryan. You didn't have any other choice. I have your suit ready, sir. Subtitles by explosiveskull
