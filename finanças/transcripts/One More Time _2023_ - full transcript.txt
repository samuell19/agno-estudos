On my birthday? - Yeah, I don't know what to do... - No, no... - I don't want to do it. - Then I'm quitting. - What? No, come on. - I think that it might be time so... Time for cake, Amelia. I need to move on from this job anyway, so this was perfect timing. [boss] Amelia, stop. I don't want it to be like this. - Please, let's talk about it. - [Man] Okay. - [Amelia] Move. - [man] Hey, what's going on? Move it! Well, that went well. No, it didn't.

[man] Is it someone's birthday? - Yeah, it's mine. - Mine too. And yeah. [Amelia] We were star friends forever... her and I. That's what we used to say because we shared a birthday. [laughs] One year we built a time capsule. - [man] What are you doing? - Please go away. - [Arez] What's a time capsule? - [Amelia] A tin that you filled with stuff and then we wrote our deepest wishes on a piece of paper. And then we buried it near the ski slope on the mountain. - So what next? - We were gonna open it once we turned 18. [both chuckle] Okay, well, did you? Mm-mm. [laughs gently] - Why not? - We weren't hanging out anymore, and, you know, when you're 18 you have different priorities. [laughs] Oh, I remember finally turning 18. That was such a great party. [sighs] What if you could turn 18 again? [both chuckle] [blows raspberry] - Amelia... - Mm? I think you should stop and get some fresh air. Um...

No, let's find something fun. Come on. - [whimsical music continues] - [kids yelling] My God, stop pulling it. You look great. I've got a little birthday present for you. I looked everywhere but this one is so you, so I really think you'll like it. Here, guess what it is. I mean, you don't have to guess, but it's fun, so... It's the rose flask you got me. Wait, what? Did Max tell you that? Ugh... I told him not to say anything. What a boring fool. How... did he say something? I'm pretty sure you mentioned the flask before. God, you mean like déjà vu? God, that's like the worst. It's happened to me too. At least now you can party in style tonight. Isn't it a sick present? Don't you like it? Hello? - Amelia, can you hear me? - What? - Isn't it the best present? - Yeah. You know, it could be fun to have at the party tonight. It's going to be the party of the year. Everyone is going to be there. Patrik... You know, Patrik, who's studying to be a foreman. He's going to be there. [squeaks excitedly] You know who I mean. Foreman Patrik? Oh yeah. And Max spoke with Gabbe in natural science class... Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Don't you notice anything different about me? What? Do I look like any older? Older? Amelia, you're one day older. That is total nonsense. What is happening? What? The last thing I remember is being hit by a truck. Could I actually be in a coma? This could be me seeing my life flash before my eyes because I'm dying. - Am I dying, Moa? - Amelia, listen... I want you to blow in my face. [exhales deeply] [sniffs] Okay, you're not drunk, right? No. Are you sniffing paint? - No. - Are you? What? - No? - No. - You're not? - No. No. Okay, here. Have some gum at least. Okay, there you go. Mm. [music fades] You know what? You actually kind of sound different today. - [Amelia] Uh-huh? - Like, more grown up. [Moa] So, I'm wearing that on top. And then I have my denim skirt. You know, the long one. And then, a corset on top. Oh, and I've cut some slits from here all the way to here. - [boy] Amelia. - Won't that look good?

Right. - When does your mom close the video store? - 9:00. - [Moa] Hey, where are you going? - [Amelia] I just need to do something. What, now? This is your party. This is all for you. Don't worry, you won't remember tomorrow anyway. [stammering] What? Just so you know, I'll never forget this. WE NOW HAVE DVD'S! [door rattling] [melancholy music playing] [owl hooting] What are you doing here? - It was closed, but since you live here... - [music fades out] Do you think you could rent that film for me? - Can't you just come back tomorrow? - I need it. [ominous music playing] [door chimes] - [dishes clattering] - [man talking on TV] I mean, there are other movies about time travel too. Peggy Sue, Back to the Future... [Fiona's mom] Okay now, Fiona, is that you? I thought that it was someone... Amelia! Oh my God, it's been so long! - [laughing quietly] - Oh... How are you, dear? - [Amelia] Fine. - Really? - Yeah, really. - Great. [chuckles] Fiona hasn't seen much of you lately. I heard that you don't hang out as much... Amelia's just renting a film. Hm. You could watch it here. Umm.. I don't know It's no bother. Nonsense. Of course you could watch a movie. Take some candy, as much as you want. Go ahead. Yeah. I'm just gonna go get something. - You can't say no to Yvonne. - [Fiona laughing] No, you can't. I have these. Just like in the good old days. - [bean bag chair crumpling] - There. Okay. Yeah. Kisses. Bye-bye. Goodnight. [laughs softly] Oh, salty licorice. Remember when we tried to see who could eat the most? Yeah, that was when I learned what "laxative" meant. [laughs] Yeah, I'll go... get the movie. [wistful string music playing] [woman on TV] Mm, it's too early. Mm... Oh! - [woman sniffs] - [Amelia and Fiona giggle] [man on TV] Something is different. [woman] Good or bad? [man] Anything different is good. - [woman moans softly] - [man laughs] I've got to check something. [magical music playing on TV] They're gone! They're all gone! - Do you know what today is? - No, what? Today is tomorrow. It happened. - [man] You're here. - [woman] I'm here. [movie clicks off] So I have to be a better person? Maybe. [sighs] I've been so dumb. I thought maybe I... I dunno, maybe I was getting second chance. I've been a bad friend. Especially with Moa. I probably ruined her grade with that presentation, and I haven't said thanks once for the party she threw. And, um... And, also the way I've treated you. I ate up your time, I forced you to watch a movie with me all night, against your will. I... I should leave you alone. I'll do it right this time. Thank you for wanting... Or you didn't want to. But thank you for watching the movie with me anyway. Uh... I'll see you tomorrow, or today. You know what I mean.

We could also include various post-structuralist perspectives, like Michel Foucault and Gayatri Spivak, and ask ourselves whether the subaltern will have a voice in the discourse surrounding modern Hinduism, while also taking new Hindu nationalist movements into consideration. Yes... That's right. [all clapping] - [coughs] - Have you seen who's here? Patrik! Come on. - [Moa] What? But... - [Amelia] You two should talk. - Hey. Moa. - Hey. I'm Patrik. [Amelia] Whoa. Yeah.
