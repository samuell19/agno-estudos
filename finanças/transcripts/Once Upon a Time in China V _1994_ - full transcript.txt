Don't worry, if the court can't deal with it we'll try something else Master, we've arrived at Mu Min Lane The place is totally deserted, what should we do? Allied forces have occupied the capital But the south is unaffected The newspaper says the south is still safe and prosperous Shouldn't that be prosperous and safe? Where did you get the paper? It's what our food was wrapped in Porky Lam I'm asking you, what time is it? Er... Er... What time is it! Two holes Two holes? Wrong! Why are you so uptight?

They didn't even ask our names We didn't have chance to get their names either Let's take a closer look Yes Bring some medicine. We need to stop the bleeding. Hurry Ken? He's one of their men Ken. You'll be fine That's why they didn't trust the Court What do you know? Pea brain Well they know the guy's name I know Fu, get Lang to kick the door in Yes What?

I'm Ken. I'm a constable too Please heroes, we are not lying to you We deserve to be punished for stealing But we had no other choice Because we haven't eaten for days It's so hard You are the Officer of the Court How come you don't have any food? Since the Allied forces captured the capital And the Empress Dowager went into hiding The Magistrate took everything and left Leaving us without a penny And so far nobody has replaced him As we have no food, many have left already We are all that remain At the same time, the pirates loot freely The citizens dare not leave their houses The place is a like a ghost town Please forgive our intrusion May I ask your name? I am called Tse I am Wong Fei Hung, these are my students Wong Fei Hung? Wong Fei Hung from Fu Shan? At your service I am Porky Lang Hello I am Club Foot You have great students I can't believe we have so many heroes here May I know your name? I am Leung Fu Wow it's Leung Fu Leung Fu? You are Master Wong Fei Hung's student? We are from Mei Province too You are the hero of the province We are so happy to meet you You are so handsome You have an heroic air, so impressive Wait until we tell our villagers we've met you, they'll be so jealous At last... These guys don't call me Owl! I've never seen Fu look so touched It makes me want to cry Really? The Dragon Boat has arrived Moving up to the top, the very top Fortune comes, comes to my door It's midday and all the doors are closed Do you think this place can ever be saved? They are scared, what a terrible way to live Look at the constables, like beggars Eat slowly, there is still rice left Thank you Such a long needle It will fight the infection Dad, we're leaving tomorrow, here are the tickets I feel better now we have them Get a good sleep More sleep? We can sleep when we get to Hong Kong Sis, Hong Kong means "Fragrant Harbour" Is it filled with sweet smelling flowers? Flowers? I don't think so But being called Hong Kong it shouldn't smell too bad Sister, you stayed with Fei Hung for some time in Beijing What do you think about him? We seldom saw each other and we didn't talk much We were both too busy for socialising But you came in the same carriage But we sat separately So you never got to know him? We are different ages I'm his Aunt, he's my junior Seniors don't notice the merits of the juniors But you think he's a good man? I think everybody is good at heart It's what you think that counts But I wanted your opinion You got it Oh, forget it. Just answer me this Go ahead. What? Do you have feelings for Fei Hung? What have you done, what were you thinking? I was just thinking about your question You should be more careful I was being careful but I couldn't avoid it It's ok, I understand This is old Master's, and this... Let's draw for it, that'd be fairest Whoever picks the blue one, takes three Whoever picks the black one takes the rest Dad, do you think he wants to be alone or not? What do you think It's the just the way he is We'll have to escort him on board tomorrow Nothing for me! I've got the red one I got blue, I'll carry three I got the black one Tickets to Hong Kong There are only two left Four thousand each I want one Four thousand, don't you have anything cheaper? How about an underwater seat, they're free! Make way Where do we get on? These tickets are so expensive That tout is a real thief If we sold ours at that price we'd be rich And how do we get to Hong Kong if we sell our tickets? I was joking It's not a joking matter Make way Sol, why aren't you carrying anything? Where's the luggage? Didn't you pick the black straw? It's... all sorted You should be carrying it, give it back to him Be careful, don't push Fei Hung is over there. Go on How long will we have to wait? Just sit down There's no rush, we've waited for days already Somebody will sell their tickets to us Sol, is it heavy? It really is I'm going to the toilet, back in a minute Are you going to Hong Kong? It's only one ticket, ask one of your family to go onboard now They've all gone on already Some bearded guys gave them their tickets They said Wong Fei Hung would give me his ticket Are you Wong Fei Hung? Yes Thank you Master Hung Some bearded guys? Thank you Master Hung See you beardy guys Peony, Aunt May? Your disguised too? Doesn't it itch? Yes it does There are eight gangs of pirates on the East Canton sea Cheung leads the Red Flag Gang, the cruellest of them all Mak Yau Kam leads the Blue Flag Gang Ha Mo Yang leads the Black Flag Gang Tiger leads the Green Flag Gang They are known as "The four kings of the sea" Their power is growing rapidly In the 15th year of Ka Hing, in order to maintain peace The government was forced to negotiate with them Cheung therefore became an official officer Now things are unsettled and the pirates have become active again In South Pun Soon they are causing real problems The year Cheung became an officer he was about 80 years old He can't still be alive According to my information, these pirates are from the eight flags Their leader is Cheung's son, Cheung Yuk Lun And his right hand man, Ying How many followers does he have They move silently and leave no survivors So I really can't put a figure on it Master We can organise a local crime prevention unit Good idea We don't know where they are, we'd better be careful But we can't let them know the magistrate has gone Sir Master Wong I hope you'll let us move into the courthouse Of course First of all, the court must be open as usual You should all put uniforms on Dad, please disguise yourself as the magistrate Disguise myself? Sorry we don't have enough rooms Please would you stay in the cells Not a problem Thank you Which is mine? This one, we've given you the biggest one Not bad at all What's inside this box? It seems heavy I've no idea, it's been sitting here forever Nobody understands the English written on it We daren't move it as we don't know what's inside What's inside? Armaments Oh, nothing special, just foreign stuff We Chinese don't use these things Let's get rid of it Come on, take it away Just a minute, better tell Master first Yes we must inform Master first Isn't that right Sir? What have you got there? Come here Wait a moment Fei Hung, we're always on the move It's difficult for us to tie the knot I want you to do one thing for me Put this ring on my finger You want me to put it on for you Come on, it's a custom What kind of custom is this? Put it on, then I'll tell you I'll put one on you next I have to wear one too? Of course, the rings are a pair They are a symbol of our marriage Marriage? I must tell Dad first Let's tell him after the wedding You can't leave in the middle of the ceremony Confetti Why do you suddenly want to get married? Well have to wait for ever otherwise And you.. Right well, let's hurry it up Hubby, you can lift my veil now Hubby? Better just call me Fei Hung Fei Hung, kiss me Kiss you? Do I really have to? Hurry up, nobody will see you, then it's done Really? Here goes Master What's this? Beauty's temptation What... They run so fast Wow, this ring has incredible power This is the Magistrate You officers want to organise a Local Crime Prevention Unit I would like to join But I can't speak on behalf of my students You'd better ask them personally See you So, are we going to fight the pirates or the foreigners? If we let the pirates land they'll fight the foreigners for us Why don't we ally with the pirates? You're so ignorant, in fact, the senior officials have already decided It's all been worked out The pirates are just puppets We can't begin to understand the hidden agendas If we get involved it will end badly for us We just do what the boss tells us, you must ask him first How can we judge who is good and who is evil? Besides, the winner is always right That's right There is an old Chinese saying "In troubled times, heroes appear" Let history decide who the heroes were We cannot change the course of history How can we ever mobilize them? They lack the spirit of unity Ok, take a break now Being a Magistrate seems like tiring work There's still no decision The chain is broken Let me help you What's the matter Dad? This chain is the only thing that makes me look like an officer Now it's broken what am I going to do? Never mind, we can stitch it together What a pain Some went behind the door The show's starting starring Master and Aunt May What's the title? Maybe he's just teaching her kung fu One's up, one's down, what kind of kung fu is this? Dad.. There's more here What is this kung fu? Don't you know? Sol, kneel down Let me demonstrate, watch closely Wait Get up again So you can do what you like It's so late, what are you doing here You scared me, why don't you go to bed? We're hungry, we're just grabbing something to eat Clubfoot, grab a watermelon I'll make a watermelon dessert It's my speciality, it's not easy What are you doing Aunt Yee? Tomorrow is Fei Hung's birthday, I'm making him a cake Let me help you.. Wah, it's so hot Check out the cake!! Fantastic! Can you teach me how to make one? Put it here I've never seen a cake so big It's just a cake, sit down! Let me teach you Sol, bring me some small candles Then put the cream inside a bag What did she say? We can't keep this up for much longer Oh no, the cake! Put it back on the table It's a mess now Pick up that piece Reform the shape Not that shape, it didn't have corners It should be round Not like that Put that piece here Dad, line it up first She's coming Oh shit! Stop squeezing It's too late, we're in for it! Cover it with something Aunt Yee, can we do anything else for you? We love making cakes A little more at the front Aunt Yee what's next? Use your finger? You put it on but you didn't mean it You have to put in on your finger too? Are they really together? Spread it evenly My eyesight is failing me Should we put it on all our fingers? Just like I thought Put more here Stop asking me so many questions! She's getting mad, better hurry up put the cream on Save some for Sol You fingers are so fat, you're just making a mess Is that all right? Is it enough? What are you doing? Making a cake..

Aunt Yee, here are the candles Cover it Put the candles on then light them Ask your master to blow them out Ok Aunt Sol My hands are all creamy I can't find it Don't hide Come out Sister? Do you think I'm stupid? I know everything What does she know? Better go and ask her It must be something serious or she wouldn't be crying. Master What's going on? Aunt Yee wants you to blow out the candles Ok, did she say why? Just do it and see what happens Go on blow What's happened to your fingers? Following Aunt Yee's instructions Nothing Did you see anything? Nothing This is very mysterious Go and ask her, what does all this mean? What do you want? I'm not in a good mood, don't make me angry She's a feisty one Lock the throat, catch the hand, move Go to hell I told you not to bother me, now you've asked for it Master! Pirates! Don't move! Peony Why did you chase after me? You must tell me what is going on I don't want this ring anymore! This is your wedding ring why are you throwing it away? Wedding ring? Wedding? When did that happen? Why wasn't I informed? Why don't you explain this to your sister Don't just stand there, look for the ring Clubfoot, didn't you hear? Come on Fu, Sol Sister, you've got it all wrong Dad, you've misunderstood Oh, we understand all right - That's right We were just helping Mr Wong fix his chain Why not just say you were taking the opportunity to learn some kung fu that's what we thought Not very convincing Dad, we didn't mean to deceive you We just didn't get the chance to tell you These words lack... lack.. Sincerity Sincerity Go and ask Mr Wong You'd better ask Aunt Yee Just don't ask us We didn't do anything They were just picking beads up after all We're not really married Impossible Impossible This is Master's most embarrassing experience There's no escaping it No way Still ok?

You can escort the pirates I don't need an escort I'll stay here with you And wait for the constables to come for the pirates I'd like to ask one favour Please pretend to court me So my sister won't be angry with me I know it's a lot to ask But I have to do something It's no problem Thank you We are family, it's our obligation Make way Two days ago, a ship was robbed on the open sea They took everything and killed all on board These are the corpses that floated back Those damn pirates! Master Wong, please check to see if these weapons are of any use Useless foreign weapons Watch my darts! I missed... Fei Hung, you are going to fight the pirates tomorrow We've been together a long time, I've learnt to be flexible We can look after ourselves, don't worry Peony Sister, your turn Aunt May Fei Hung, don't worry, we'll be ok Are you worried? No, you're not worried Oh I don't know what to say! Don't worry Just go I'm done You can't even do that right Mr Porky Lang, Mr Clubfoot, Mr Wong The sea is rough, is there a storm coming? Maybe - Mister Clubfoot Master Remember, call me Mister Wong Oh, yes Master Er.. Mister Master Wong Where is Mr Fu, go and find him Sol, do you have any sour plum?

Just wait, I need to puke again I can't take much more of this Damnit, why did you die next to me? Think you can escape? Come back here! Drop you weapons!

What is this? It tastes like horse piss! Master, look! The women who were kidnapped We can't risk hurting innocents, so we can't use the gunpowder We have to save them first Ying is coming, what should we do? Let's get up for now Where are you men from? Are you new to us? I've been here for ages, just enjoying my beer! We came from Bonero, we're under Flying Monkey Flying Monkey? He's already set sail. Why are you still here? He knows we lack experience He wanted us to stay until the next job Understand? Shit, you've got some guts! Flying Monkey does what I say, so do you! Understand?! Nice one! Master is too much Someone is coming It's me, aren't I fat enough to recognise? Fatty, you made me jump! Master is in Ying's bedroom What? He lost control again What shall we do then?
