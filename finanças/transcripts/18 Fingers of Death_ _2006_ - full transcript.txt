I was minding my own business, ordering some of my favorite- - twice-deep-fried spicy duck egg rolls- - from Fong's Egg Rolls and Donut Shop. Suddenly, I was attacked by these 23 Chinese gang punks. I kicked their little butts with my extraordinary- - lightning fast, authentic, Japanese Aikido techniques. And you know What I told them? This is What I said: "Get ready to meet your maker."

Without music, there is no soul, no vibe, - no good feeling in the film. But if you got that, - that's when you bring all the ladies here, you know? Hell, yeah, I'm telling you, man. This is my first time as a boom operator. You see, Buford heard me rappin' at his nephew's birthday party ...and saw me handle the mike. The first time we rehearsed the fight scene- - and he let out one of his famous screams, - I couldn't believe it. If they had a world's record for the loudest screams in movies, - it'd go to Buford. He is the real deal, man. True. You want to hear the track I'm working on for the movie? Why not? Okay, check it out. Wa-ta! Are you ready? Oh, yeah, yeah. ♪ There's a man ♪ ♪ who kicks it like no other, ♪ ♪ So gather around; ♪ ♪ Hear what I've got ♪ ♪ to say about this brother. ♪ ♪ He's not Ling Ching Chong ♪ ♪ from Hong Kong. ♪ ♪ We call him Buford Lee ♪ ♪ out of South Central. ♪ That's all I have right now, but I need some music to it, - and I think it's going to be jimmy-jammin' when I finish it. What do you think? Hey, we can work out something. Cool. Here we are at the fighting rehearsals for the actors- - and the stuntmen, although we had to share- - the space with the belly dancers. Don't even worry about it; Don't even fret. Just prepare to fight! There are proper rules for fighting the hero. When the hero is surrounded by the bad guys, - they can only attack one at a time. An excellent technique for the bad guys to use- - while waiting their turn- - is the traditional method of circling around the hero. Yo, Buford, check this out. Let's have them do the snake. To throw your opponent off, hit him with the snake. Okay, now hit him with the robot! With the riverdance, come on. Buford gave me my first job; It's about 12 years ago. It was on Indiana Jung and the Temple of the Shaolin. I was delivering port-a-potties for a company- - that delivered port-a-potties to sets of movies- - and stuff like that. I was on my regular poop collection. And I see there's no cook. "Buford, baby, what's the problem here? Let me cook for these guys." Bam! And there it was, 12 years ago. People always ask me, - "Sammy, baby, what's your favorite story?" I met Buford, and he put me on this great movie. It was Revenge of the Latino Dragon. It was Chu Yu's last fight scene, to the death. He was fighting the Little Dragon- - and the Mexican Cucaracha gang. Anyway, it was Cinco de Mayo. I went to him; I said, " Listen, - "out of respect for the Mexicans, let's pay homage. Let's make a big Mexican meal." Let me tell you something. I cooked my... ugh! I made enchiladas; I made tacos; I made burritos. I had the rice. I had the guacamole. I had the onions, the tortillas, - and a ton of refried beans. The cast and Buford ate it all up. And right after lunch was when they shot- - that famous fight scene. ♪ Oof. You, stupids, go! Ay, caramba. Ay, caramba. Hit him in the knee! Get up, stinky. Hyah! Yah! You have been chosen by your country- - to compete in the most prestigious tournament- - in the world. Join me in our celebration party tonight. And go fight tomorrow as if there is no tomorrow. You got it, man. You mastered the style of speaking out of synch- - in just two lessons. You're a natural-born martial art actor. Thank you, Master Wilson. Man, I can't believe it; You got Don "The Dragon" Wilson- - to come to the martial arts acting class, man. He's just a great buddy, man. Yo, Master Wilson. I've been working on this all night. Tell me what you think. I am a French légionnaire, - and I am here to avenge my brother's death, - in a fight to the death. Blood-spatcon-tiste, prepare to fight! Ow! Fantastic, Tyrone. You see, it's not just exciting fight action- - that makes a martial art movie great. A martial art actor must learn all the accents- - as well as proper delivery of dialogue. Understand? Thank you. I love my butt. You play too much, Buford. But I'm so excited to start shooting tomorrow. You got that right, Ronald. Hey, and thanks, Sushi, for coming on board- - as our producer. And as our lead actress. I can't sleep tonight. I am so pumped. Hey, you guys, I think you should hear this. The Sundance Film Festival starts in two days. The deadline for the entry was months ago. I misread the dates. At least we'll be ready for next year. Next year? Look what you did. Say, Pops. Buford. Hungry? Nah, that's cool, Dad. Something ain't cool. Say, do you ever think about- - doing something else with your life? Maybe I should just be a cook- - and run this here restaurant for you. Get out of here. Kitchen, we'll talk. You know, time has got a way of creeping up on you. And when it does, it's going to kick your ass... ...front kick ya. I know. All I ever wanted to do was just get a chance to prove myself. Sometimes I wonder if I'm... what if I'm not good enough? What if I'm not bad-ass enough, or I never hit it or... What if, What if, What if, What if, What if? What if you ain't bad-ass enough? Who's gonna care? And how you gonna know at least if you don't try? It's like... here, this old duck. It's just a duck; It feeds a lot of people. But, Buford, I'm telling you, man, - you gotta punch and squeeze, and you gotta flip it around, - and you're going to have to do lots of shit- - that you don't want to do, man. But that's life; That's living. You gonna have to scratch and scream and holler and moan- - and... ...I know, man, 'cause it happened. It happened to me. I got to this place where I started to listen- - to all my "buddies" telling me what I could do- - and I couldn't do and I shouldn't and I wouldn't- - and a-biggy da ba-biggy bop-bop-bop. Come on! One day, I woke up so convinced, I quit. I quit. I gave up my dream, - put my dream away. Look here, you don't do that. You do not do that. It's traditional on the first day of shooting- - to pay respect to the movie gods. You take three sticks of incense and bow three times. One... Wait for me. Wait for me! Ow! Ow! Get off of him! And so began our first day of shooting. The opening scene is when Buford, - as Cho San Wan, rescues Sushi, - as the beautiful Miss Tingaling, - from a bunch of troublemakers. And action. Buford was magnificent with his slow motion- - hero entrance. Please! Let me go! Get the mic. I have to say, he does it better than anybody in the business. Help me. Oh, my God! When Buford finished that first take for the opening fight- - and looked into Sushi's eyes... Untie me. Cut! Print that mother right there. That's the one we want! Was that it? I just knew our movie- - was going to be a huge success! I knew it. It was good? It was real? You were fabulous too, brother. Was he in my light? Cut! My directing style was fast and furious. The shoot went as smooth as a baby's booty. I don't understand how the premiere invitations- - for the new Jackie Chong movie were misprinted- - and sent out with the address- - for the 18 Fingers of Death premiere. Hmm, it is also a coincidence that both- - were at the same time on the same day. You can bet your ass- - this matter will be looked into immediately. But for now, we'd better get next door to the theater- - because it's showtime! Your soundtrack was off the hook. Yeah, I got some more dope ones at the house, though. Give me a call. Do you represent anyone like me? Not one as talented, though. I've got to get some of that martial arts stuff- - in my next movie. Mr. Lee, your performance- - as the wise martial arts director was so real. Are you sure you've never acted before? Oh, girl, I have been rehearsing and practicing my entire life- ...so that one day I could become a major kung fu movie star. It worked. See ya. Hey, guys, all right, all right. Give me some up in here. I am so proud of you guys, man. Congratulations, that was beautiful in there. Thank you, thank you. Listen, I've got to get back to the restaurant- - and help Mom with the after-premiere dinner party. And how about this one? Mom sprung for our very own karaoke machine. ♪ Party, party, party, party. ♪ I'll catch you over there, guys. See you, Dad. Your pops is crazy, just crazy. Hey, man... Ronald Mack! Yeah, that's me. I am absolutely blown away with your directing talent. Thanks a lot. I know you! You're Joel Gold, - the biggest action movie producer in Hollywood! But how did you know who I was, though? Come on, I know talent when I see it. That's Why I am who I am. You be at my office I want to sign you to a directing deal. Man, you yanking my chain, right? All right, I'll tell you What. Let's make it a 27-picture deal. Jo-Jo, let's go; I'm so hungry. Oh, Mr. Gold, I want you to meet the man- - that made all of this possible here. Meet Mr. Buford Lee. Yo, Mr. Gold, it's my pleasure to meet you... Yeah, me too. Why don't you meet us for dinner tonight. We'll go over some movie ideas. See you at Spago's, eh? Gotta run. Bye, boys. Bye. Do you know who that was? That was Mr. Big Time, man. He can make just about anybody, man. You gets to go; It's your shot. I'm happy for you, man. Look, I'll give you a call tomorrow; We can do lunch. I gotta go. I always knew we were going to make it. ♪ Sushi, you're still here. You know, I am just starving. I Wish I could find a talented, handsome movie star- - in a red shirt who could possibly take me to dinner. As you wish. I would be honored. Oh, Mr. Decker, why don't you go ahead and take the night off? Or, if you'd like, you could follow us- - and film our falling-in-love montage. ♪ Buford, think fast. Buford Lee's funhouse. Uh, yeah, I can give him a message. Uh-huh? Uh-huh. Um, oh. Okay, yeah, I'll tell him. What's up? Ronald's personal secretary just called and said- - that he's going to be so busy working on his next film- - that he won't have time to finish the documentary. He wants you to keep all the footage, - and he wishes you good luck. Buford, I'm sorry. Hey, Sushi, will you help me finish this documentary? Really? Will you be my new partner? I would love to be your new partner. Count me in, Buford! Hey, thanks for hanging with me, Mr. Decker. You know, I can edit all these. I just got a new system off the internet. You have a new editing system? Yeah, it's still in the box, just came in yesterday. Here are the ratings- - on the first and second run of your documentary, - The Way of Life: A Biography of Buford Lee. This was just terrific, Mr. Tuner. And we want you to know that we're so grateful- - that you believed in our project. It's not often we get someone to pay us for their documentary. Now we're here to pitch a big money-making idea- - that is sure to make Buford's career. Tell him. Mr. Tuner, imagine Sushi and I are in a warehouse, - and then... Welcome to Kung Food. And a movie. This week's movie classic is considered - the Gone With the Wind of martial arts movies, - our personal favorite, Enter the Dragon, - with the legendary Bruce Lee. And cut! That was great, just really terrific. It was great? Okay, good. Okay, you need to move on to the next set. How's your back? Is it okay? And your head? Oh, this thing's fine. This week's Kung Food recipe: We will show you how to make- - one of Master Bruce Lee's favorite dishes, - pan-fried chow mein with spicy... Chicken! But right now, we have to pay our bills. Watch this commercial from our very generous sponsor. Even after a nine-course dinner, there's always room- - for Honorable Fortune Cookies. Wa-ta! Five, four, three, two... We're back! Coming up, our special guest was one of the background extras- - in the final fight scene in Enter the Dragon. But, for now, enjoy the movie. And see you on the break. Hey, Buford, What's Bruce Lee's favorite drink? Wa-ta! Ai-yah! Hai-yah! Hai-yah! Hai-yah! Yah! Master Lee, would you have time for that interview now? Please, call me Buford. Sure, now is a good time. What magazine is this again? Inside Kung Fu, - the biggest martial arts magazine in the world. Uh, first off, congratulations on the success- - of your public access cable show. We've got a great team. We have the entire Los Angeles County market saturated. Well, except for Beverly Hills, - certain areas in Hollywood, Santa Monica. So, anyway, What are you planning for your next movie? I want to explore some very different approaches- - to the martial arts genre. Something futuristic? Maybe something with special effects? So you are the aerobics/martial arts instructor- - on this giant space ship, okay? It's, like, the ultimate luxury cruise liner of the future. And there's a love interest, of course, right, - and a lot of martial arts sequences, right? But the kicker is that this ship is doomed to collide- - with this giant meteor, and there's not enough- - emergency escape craft for everybody. So you sacrifice yourself for the woman you love... ...and float off into space. Okay, it's going to be really expensive, and, obviously, - there's no sequel, but it could be- - the biggest blockbuster in Hollywood history. Hey, in fact, I happen to have a script- - right here. Check it. I just got a great idea. I'll be right back. Be right here. Yes, I need the contracts today! Get them done in an hour, or you're fired! What is it, sweetie pie? We have our next movie project. It's crazy, I'm telling you. I even have the title. We will call it: In a time when there was no law, - they are cooking-show hosts by day- - and crime fighters by night. Coming soon to a theater near you. Well, we only have a trailer; We are looking for financing. But there is a title: Buford, I'm so glad to be back with you, man. All that Hollywood glam, that's just not my thing. And, of course, you know- -we've got to finish our movie with a music video.
