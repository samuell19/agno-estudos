I'm sorry, I don't wanna interrupt anything. Oh, don't be silly. Please, join us. Oh, I know, kids, Why don't we learn what my former star student has been doing so that you can learn why it's important to be good students?

No. A consultant? Yes, that one. I consult people. What's a consultant? That's not even a real job. It is, too. I help people solve problems. What kinds of problems? Like um... what clothes to wear or what restaurants to eat at or who runs the door at the hottest clubs. Um... I should probably excuse myself. Oh, uh, just a second, Angie. Kids, give me a minute. Um, work on some of your word problems. I always knew you'd be successful. You know, some kids I worry about but with you I knew you would do great things in your life. I'm so very proud of you. Thanks, Mrs. B. Your class really meant a lot to me. See those two kids over there? That's Sydney and Landon. They remind me so much of you and Gabe Hudson. Remember how you were at that age? You were inseparable. Oh, I remember. Did you know around Christmastime Gabe and I used to write each other's letters to Santa? I guess I knew what Gabe wanted before he did and vice versa. [laughs] You know, I always figured you would end up together. Me and Gabe? That's crazy. I know. Crazy. I don't know if you knew this but Gabe teaches a cooking class for the kids after school on Tuesdays. Both he and Tyler Davis give so much time to the school. You remember Tyler? Uh, Tyler Davis? That rings a bell. You know, when we couldn't afford two coaches for the basketball team Tyler stepped up and volunteered his time. It's so good to see you all giving back to the community. Well, I haven't missed a charity ball since I moved to New York City. [laughs] Well, I don't know if we have any fancy charity balls here in Greenwood but I did hear that some of my former students are getting together at MacMillan's tonight for their annual Christmas party. I bet you know some of them. Gabe will be there, and Tyler and Raj- Oh, Tyler will be there? Mmmhmm. Well, that's what he said the other day after school. I'm so sorry, I just realized there's somewhere I have to be. Thanks, Mrs. B. Oh, one more thing, Angie. Before you go I have a big favour to ask, if you have the time. Do you think you could swing by here after school and help out with the kids? Oh, you're so good in math and I know that they would appreciate learning from someone who's been so successful. Uh, well, I um... Yes. Sure. Oh! Anything you need, I'm happy to help. Wonderful! I'll be in touch, and you start working on some challenging word problems. You got it.

I just wish I could get some more young people in here, but- Well, this stuff is super cute. I'm looking for something to wear to the MacMillan's Christmas party tonight. Oh, great. I can help you with that. And, if you don't mind my saying so, that mannequin in the window, that style was super popular last winter. I think if you dress it in something like this you'll get more young people coming in. Hi, Krissy. How'd I do this month? Pretty good, actually. A couple hundred. One sec. Ok. Anything new? Not this time, still just trying to sell those Christmas stockings. Alright, here you go. Thanks, Krissy. Yep, have a good day. You too. What was that about? Oh, you see this casing over here? Well, people can rent a shelf and sell their old items. It's mostly vintage jewellery, that kind of thing, but uh, it brings in some extra cash for me, so... Oh, cool. Are you interested? Oh,no. No. [laughs] Ok. Alright, so we gotta find you an outfit. [gasps] Here. Yep, try this one on. It's perfect. It'll look killer on you. Look at this coat! Isn't it so cute? I have to get it, right? Hi!

Some people are bad with names. I've forgotten my own name once or twice. So what happened next? Um, well we finally got to talking and Tyler was telling me all about this after school program he wants to start and I thought it was going really well but then later he just got up and left. I had to get a ride home from Gabe. Oh, like Tyler's best friend, Gabe? Study buddy Gabe? Yeah. Interesting. And you have no idea why Tyler might have pulled a vanishing act? No, none. I really thought it was going well. I have no idea why he just got up and left like that. Ok, great. I mean, great, because we still have a plan. Everything's fine. Don't be so worried.

Class: Three! Good job. Come on, Miss Moore, that's too easy. Ugh, you're right. I know. How about a word problem about Gabe's famous Christmas cookies? Ok, let me think. Got one. Gabe sells bags of Christmas cookies for $4 each. He sells 30 bags of tree-shaped cookies. Does that look like a tree? [laughs] And he sells 21 bags of star-shaped cookies. How much money does Gabe make for the tree-shaped cookies, how much money does he make for the star-shaped cookies, and how much all together? Good one, Angie. And look how engaged they are. Oh, good. Except that word problem made me hungry. Maybe after this I'll go down to Frank's Diner and grab some of those cookies for myself. Well, save some for me. And me. And me. You got it.

And judging by the fact that while I was sitting here Richie burned two steaks and broke what seemed like a dozen dishes. I'm guessing he has something to do with that. Yeah, um, ok. What're you suggesting? It would actually be cheaper to hire another chef to help you with the cooking and just keep Richie on as front of house. Ok. I like the sound of that. There are a few other small ways you could tweak your budget and I can come up with some ideas to help give the diner a face lift, but I'll just need a little time. You know, I think the biggest thing is people have just forgotten what Frank's Diner is all about, you know? You should do something to remind them who you are. A charity dinner.

My boss is always looking for up and coming chefs to work with and after trying your food tonight I think she'd definitely be interested. So Angie called you? Yeah.

That ornament was the last Christmas gift my dad gave me. Yeah, well think of all the pretty little things you can buy with your dad's money once you get married. My dad always used to say it's what's on the inside that matters. Uh, yeah. Inside your bank account. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea. It feels wrong. I hate lying to these guys. Guys? What guys? Tyler. I meant Tyler. But Tyler knows. Tyler understands. This is a marriage based on mutual trust and understanding. Actually, that's more than most marriages have. Such an optimist, Paulette. Honey, I'm living in the real world. Well, I'm still lying to everyone else then. I hate this feeling in my stomach. That's just pre-wedding jitters. Everybody gets that. That's normal. It's not pre-wedding jitters. This is not a normal wedding. Can't you just let me be sad for a minute, Paulette? Honey, you're about to get married. This is the happiest time of your life, remember? If this is the happiest time of my life I'm in big trouble. This mac and cheese is particularly good tonight, son. Mmm. I put some lobster and truffle oil in there.

She um, she did me a huge favour. A woman at a New York City restaurant developer is interested in me and my cooking. What does that mean? Well, hopefully it would mean opening my own place. My own restaurant. But you have a place. The diner? Yes. Look, I thought you were here to help me get this place back on its feet. Are you telling me you're not gonna do that anymore? No, Dad.

Nice, lovely. See? Oh. Alright. Well, I have to say that our newly engaged couple wins the basket! To Tyler. I cannot believe you're getting married, man. But it couldn't be to a more amazing girl. So to Tyler and Angie. To Tyler and Angie. Thanks, guys. Thanks, Gabe. Seriously, man. How dare you get married? Woah. I mean, joke all you want but she's making my dreams come true. I can't believe this girl comes back after like seven years and just offers you a fortune. You're the luckiest guy in the world. Wait, what? What- what does that mean? I mean, Angie and I, we just uh, we have an arrangement. Yeah you did. What- what arrangement? Well, I guess there's no harm in telling you now, but uh, basically she's entitled to a huge trust if we get married. So... so she asked you to marry her so she could inherit money? Yeah, exactly. I mean, I wasn't cool with it at first but... I mean, once she offered to help me out with my business, I mean, I couldn't say no. Yo. Gabe. Yo, where are you going, man? Come on. Need some help? Sure. Here, put a bow on it. So what did you think of Tyler? I'll be honest, I wasn't expecting to like him and... and he's not who I would have pictured you with. Do you think dad would have liked him? You knew your father. No one would be good enough for his little girl. [laughs] Honey, it only matters what- what you feel about him. And is he the one? The one that you wanna spend the rest of your whole life with? Gabe! I need to talk to you. I was just coming to find you. So I know about your deal. What? Tyler told me about the money. You're seriously gonna marry a guy that you don't love for some trust fund? That's not what it's like. Oh, ok. What is it like? I mean, yes, technically that's what happened- Oh, I'm such an idiot. Gabe. I- I thought you were different. What happened to you since high school? I'm still the same- No. No, you're not the same girl. The girl I knew had goals. She had ambitions, she was driven. She was gonna do something important, like help people. Enjoy your life sipping champagne and laying on a beach. Gabe, wait! Hey. Sweetheart. Dad? Just thought I'd stop by and say hello. Woah. I see congratulations are in order. Who's the unwitting gentleman? Tyler Davis. Really? How'd he get so lucky? It's not too late, honey. Yes, it is. It breaks my heart to think you're marrying someone you don't love. What else am I supposed to do? You certainly don't have to do this. I can't back out now. What would mom think of me? Your mom can be tough. But she loves you and your sister more than anything in the world. I just let everyone down. I let mom down, I let you down, I even let Gabe down. All I ever wanted, honey, was for you to be happy. And I think you know deep down what will truly bring you happiness. I miss you. I miss you, too. You know what to do. Good morning. Hi.

Well, I know your company does amazing charitable work. Healthful Foods should sponsor the Frank's Christmas Eve dinner. Oh, I don't know about that. Look, Frank's can't afford to donate all of their own food and my donation from this sale will only go so far. I know how people in Greenwood feel about big companies coming in and forcing small ones out of business. You wanna be a responsible and important member of this community. Just imagine how people will feel when they learn that their warm Christmas meal was provided by you. That's what Christmas is all about, isn't it? It's the end of the year, we've already allocated most of our charitable funds budget, but... We're in! Really? Oh, that's fantastic! I'll have our truck sent over to Frank's ASAP. Anything you need. Thank you, Julia. And Merry Christmas! Your mother was right about you. Oh, you only have one shirt left. I'll take it. Sophia? You do not have to do that. You are not going to wear this. I know.

Wow, that- that does sound perfect. Ok, here's the thing. I know things must be crazy up there right now but is there any chance you can do a quick interview before the wedding?

Ok, I have another question for you. What is your favourite animal and why? I don't think they're gonna ask that in the interview. Do you wanna get this job or not? Yes, I do. Ok, favourite animal... I don't know, I have so many, it's hard to narrow it down. The correct answer is a reindeer. Well, in an interview there are no right or wrong answers. It's more of a conversation. That was a trick question, and you passed. Really? Yeah. You got this. You're ready. Thanks, guys. Put 'er here. Yeah. I got this. Yeah. Thank you so much for helping me these last few weeks. I really appreciate it. Honestly, I think it was you and the kids that helped me. Oh, I'm really sorry that I'm gonna miss your Christmas wedding.

Look, I know I'm going to have to prove myself but I'm really ready to do that. Just this last week alone I helped Frank's Diner with their financial planning and I was crucial in organizing their first ever Christmas Eve charity dinner by coordinating with Julia Newton, the CEO of Healthful Foods. Oh, we know who she is. I'm impressed. But we know you live in New York. Are you really willing to leave the big city for small-town life? Greenwood has charmed me away from the big city. Trust me, I'm as surprised as you. I never could have imagined falling in love with a place that I already knew so well. I ignored Greenwood and thought it'd be crazy for us to end up together because we grew up together and we have so much history but then coming back here and the food and the conversation and it just feels... right. Are we still talking about Greenwood? [laughs] Sorry, yes. [laughs] I'm just really excited about this job. Angie, can I be honest with you? Of course. We really think you'd be a great fit here, but... But? But you have to say yes to the job first. [laughing] Really? He does this to everyone we interview that gets a job. I really thought. I'm pretty convincing, I know, right? Thank you. Like I said, we like to kid. [laughs] We have an entry level position we'd love to offer you. I'll email you the details.
