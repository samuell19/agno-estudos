(bells jingling) (joyful music, alarm clock ringing) (gasp) (groaning) (Jinkx's phone vibrates) (doors slamming) (joyful music continues) ♪ Oh come all ye faithful ♪ - Jesus Christ. Oh hello. What an unexpected surprise. Jinkx, our guests are here. - Good morning everyone. - I didn't even hear you come in. - If you were a murderer, she'd be dead by now. Breakfast? Well, we are glad you're here. - You know, it just wouldn't be the holidays without entertaining guests and making new friends. - But there's a pandemic, so we'll have to settle for social distancing and talking to a camera. - Jinkx, this is supposed to be timeless and you're going to hurt the camera's feelings. Please make yourselves comfortable. We are overjoyed to have you in our home. - It's a soundstage. - Well, yes, but we do sleep here. You know, Jinkx, it's hard to believe that it's taken us this long to do a Christmas special, just the two of us. - Well, and what's his name? - Just the two of us, after how many years of friendship? - I don't know, 10? - Yes, 10 long, arduous years. So welcome to DeLa and Jinkx's. - Jinkx and DeLa's - Christmas - Holiday - Snow-tacular hot choc-a-palooza Jesus baby hour. (giggles) - What? We are not calling it that. - Yeah, yeah yeah yeah, we agreed on it. - Well, I don't know why I don't remember. - It's the only title that truly captures the holiday joy that we'll be spreading tonight. - That's not all I'll be spreading tonight. - Jinkx, please. Not in front of the baby Jesus. - Jesus is here? - He's everywhere. - So I need you to be extra jolly. Stick to the script. - What? - The script. We wrote a script. - When? - Well, you weren't there. (paper rustling) - Jingle-utations, my merry little X-mas elves, and thank you for choosing DeLa and Jink... Jinkx and DeLa for your virgin birth-nificent festi-tainment. Come join us by the hearth and warm the cockles of your heart. DeLa, I am not reading this. - You said it, Jinkx. Over the next hour, we will be stuffing your stockings chock full of wholesome old timey traditions. We'll be singing classic carols in the public domain, reading Victorian poetry quietly to ourselves, poking popcorn onto a string for some reason. - DeLa, nobody wants that. - Oh, well, there can be a lot of blood loss, but just look what you get for your trouble. - Nobody wants popcorn on a string. - The script says they do. - No. - They do. - DeLa! - How about some Little Drummer Boy? - Ugh, come on, DeLa, give the people what they want. You're a drag queen. - A what? - This is a holiday drag show. Some dirty jokes, some sexual innuendo. We're talking poppers, not popcorn and no Little Drummer Boy. This is a show for BIG DRUMMER MEN with big old drumsticks. I'm talking hung like a... (DeLa beats drum) - Stocking by the chimney with care in hopes that Saint Nicholas... - Will stuff his fat silver daddy dic-- (drum hit) - ♪ The halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa la la ♪ - I want you to slide your...

(drums crash to the ground) - Jinkx, no! This show is not going to be like that. This show is going to be wholesome. It's going to be pleasant. Now, I think that the two of us should go for a long walk in a wintry wonderland, and if that should lead to a rousing opening number, well then so be it.

Isn't it nice when we're all on the same page and the page is my page? Ha, this show was going to be the Pope's poop. A brand new Christmas tradition. - Yeah, whatever. Just as long as we can move past these crappy old traditions. - No, Jinkx, Jinkx, no. Old traditions are important too. They keep us tethered to the past, like a cinder block to the ocean floor, and besides, without tradition, how would we stay connected to our ancestors and all of their backwards antiquated thinking? - Oh, come on. Name one good tradition. - One? I can name five. My grandmother's eggnog recipe. Nana's Christmases were always perfect, and this spicy raw egg milk brings the memories flooding back. Christmas in Connecticut, as frosty and white as the state itself. Sitting up straight in itchy formalwear, getting stacks of blank thank you cards as gifts. Getting asked your five-year plan as a seven year old. Nana may be gone now but her spirit lives on within this nog. [Heavenly chorus of angels] Ahhhhh [Nana] As long as you have this recipe, I'll always be with you, DeLa. - Nana. - All right. Be careful with those things. - Oh no, don't worry. I've already had salmonella. You can't get it twice. It's like the chicken pox. - Well, that is not correct, but I mean careful, 'cause there's a lot of booze in there and you're kind of a lightweight. - Oh no, it's all cream and sugar. The rum cooks off. - When? (slurping) Well, my grandmother passed down a recipe too, you know, but it was just the phone number for Domino's. - Oh, Jinkx, you never had a traditional family eggnog recipe? That's so sad. Uh, what did your grandmother serve in her heirloom crystal? - I think one reason you're so horny for the holidays is 'cause you have no idea what Christmas is like for those of us raised in the upper middle lowest class. - Oh, Jinkx. I'm so sorry. Tell me all about it. - Well, I... - Go ahead. - Well I... - I'm listening. - Well... - Do you think I should get bangs?

I just have to help you find that holiday spirit, and I know just how to do it. We'll practice our big dance number.

I just wish that I could force her to have a good time against her will like you did for me. How did you do it? - Through the spirit of tradition. - The spirit of tradition. - Yes, you must always keep it inside you during the holiday season. Come on, have a little taste. (slurps) - (Gasp!) Ah, I can feel it now, that gnawing pang that says that nothing I ever do will live up to the memories of the past or others' expectations of the future. Oh, thank you Nanog.

Now, come on Jinkx, and help me wish all of our guests a Merry Christmas. Ho! Ho! Ho! - Why can't we just say Happy Holidays? - We are by saying Merry Christmas. Christmas isn't like, Christmas. It's a blanket term. It covers everyone. Just a big, heavy blanket term that lays over everyone else's beliefs pinning them to the mattress until they comfortably drift into an eternal slumber. - But I don't celebrate Christmas. - Oh, all right. What do you celebrate? Oh, is it like that um (Hebrew uvulating, "Ch....") Jewish Christmas? - Hanukkah? Hanukkah is not Jewish Christmas. That's just what the Santa industrial complex wants you to think, and no, I don't celebrate anything. Thanks for finally asking by the way. How typical, you fascists in your red hats. You're so busy shoving Christmas down my throat. - I'm sorry. I thought you liked that. So you don't believe in anything? - I didn't say that. I believe in things, real things, tangible things like attuning myself to the natural rhythms of life's forces marked by the phases of the moon and the seasonal quarters of the year.

In my day, we said Merry Christmas to everyone. Jews, left-handed people, beggars on the street who we wouldn't give change to. It was just what we did and nobody seemed to mind. - Well, I suppose that it couldn't hurt to be a little more inclusive. - Ugh, you kids and your buzz words. Happy Holidays, inclusivity, Women's lib, desegregation. (Nanog giggles) Have a little sip of me. It will calm your nerves and make you more pliable. - What? - Convivial. (slurps) - You know, I think we've gotten off track. Is receiving presents what this time of year is really all about? Sure. Is Santa Claus the one true prophet? Absolutely. But every December I still like to take a moment to douse myself in Holy water, to fondle some rosaries, and to reflect on that other Christmas thing. You know the one. - You mean that whole circle jerk between the Father, the Son, and the Holy ghost? Angels, Virgin birth. You don't think Mary was just trying to pull one over on us? - Oh, I don't like to overthink it. - Oh, well then, sounds like Christianity is a good fit for you. - That's right. It's time for a good old fashioned Christmas pageant. Jinkx will be playing Gabriel, the angel who worked as God's messenger. - Hey, these are mine and they are not rosaries. - Eww, and I'll be playing Mary, the beautiful virgin. - Why do you get to play the virgin? - Anyway, let me set the scene. It was a dark and stormy night. - Oh boy. - And Mary was just virginin' around, and then God saw her and He was like, ah-wooo-ga, who's that hot tomata, homina, homina, and then Gabriel came unto Mary and Mary was like, what the? And then Gabriel said, Hey, my friend thinks you are super cute, and He wants to put a baby inside you, but don't worry, you will not get to have sex, and then Mary was like, yeah, I gotta go.

Uhhh, Jesus died a notoriously gruesome death. - What? No way. - Yeah, it was kind of his whole thing. - Pfft, that's not how I heard it. If you want to get into detail, the story was that Santa couldn't fly his sleigh, and then he remembered that Jesus' nose was all red and shiny 'cause he drank a lot of wine. So Jesus joined all the other reindeer, but then Frosty was like, help I'm melting 'cause I have leprosy, but Jesus was like, I love lepers and prostitutes, but then the Nutcracker ratted Him out to Pontius Pilate and then. - DeLa, this is insane. None of this makes any sense. If I know this isn't how the story goes, then you know it's wrong. I am not doing this. - But it's, but it's. - But it's, but it's in the script. Yeah, well screw your script. Maybe it's time I write some of this script. - Jinkx, no, you can't. (trilling) I'm a big, stupid idiot. Hey! - How's it feel? Ha ha! - Hey, Jinkx, come on. I'm a big starry eyed dumdum, and I just want to make everything all about myself. (in baby voice) Me wuv Cwismas. Twadition, twadition, derp, derp, derp. Stop it! - No! This is what you get! (crying) - I need a dipey change! - DeLa takes a time out in her room to think about what she's done like the bad baby she is. - Jinkx, don't push me. (door slams) - You don't have the guts. - Oh yeah? Stop hitting yourself, stop hitting yourself. - Oh, you want to go with stage directions? That's it. The gloves are off. Suddenly, DeLa tumbles down the stairs like a stupid fat boulder (thumping down stairs) rolling down a stupid fat hill. - You can't get rid of me that easy. - Out of nowhere, we have an indoor wind storm picks up on the soundstage and blows only DeLa out of frame. (intense wind storm) (Jinkx cackling) (DeLa screams) (Jinkx laughs maniacally) (Jinkx laughs maniacally) The audience, so enamored with how Jinkx handled the situation, begins to cheer uncontrollably for her. (laughing) (audience cheering) - DeLa re-enters the set, having fully recovered from all of her injuries and looking freaking gorgeous. Jinkx, dumbfounded, just flatulates. (farting) (screaming) (more farting, wet and gross) (Jinkx vocalizes horror) - Stop it, stop, stop. (still more farting) How dare you! You know I hate poop humor! - Oh, do you? - I love poop. Farts, farts, farts. (gasping) I have had it, DeLa! You have taken over this entire show and I am not... - But you need me. - I don't need you for anything. I don't need anyone. - Well, let me just... - No, I am done letting you just. Now I'm going to just. DeLa drops her script and her editing crayon. She struggles to move but to no avail, knowing that whatever's coming to her, she's brought upon herself. Suddenly a giant polar bear storms the set, (huge roars, dramatic music) a mountain of fur, fangs, and claws. The snarling beast charges DeLa, who is dragged into the wintry oblivion, knowing that CHRISTMAS... IS... RUINED...! (DeLa screams, polar bear roars, intense dramatic music) (door slams) (Jinkx stomps across the stage) (yelling) Co-write this show with me, Jinkx. Star in the show with me, Jinkx. I can't do it without you, Jinkx. She never wanted to share this day with me. - [Naked Guy] You gonna finish those? (Jinkx screams) (glass bottle shatters) - Oh, shit! I am so sorry. I didn't know you were still here, or remember that you were here to begin with. - Oh, it's fine, but are you gonna finish these? - What am I still doing here? I don't need to live on this soundstage. There are all sorts of unlocked buildings I could be sleeping in. She doesn't need me and I don't need her. - Who? - DeLa. She said we had to do this stupid holiday show no matter how idiotic I told her it was. She just hounded and hounded and hounded. - Hmm, sounds like she really wanted to spend the holiday with you. - (cackling) If she wanted to spend the holiday with me, then she has a sick way of showing it. She has been at her absolute worst. - Oh, maybe she's just stressed. Christmas kind of sucks for everyone, right? - Not for DeLa. DeLa grew up in an ivory tower, surrounded by other smaller ivory towers in some kind of ivory gated community. Also, the trees were ivory. - Are you going to finish these? - The point is DeLa grew up having the kind of Christmases that I only heard about, and I only heard about them from other kids who had also only heard about them. It was several degrees of removal. - Like a game of Telephone. - What? - Like a game of Telephone. Comes out sounding all different on the other side. - I'm sorry. Did you just turn my rant into a metaphor? I just mean, you weren't there. Are you going to finish this? Hmm, maybe your experiences weren't actually all that different. (bong bubbling) Maybe you two just deal with them in different ways. (exhales) - With all due respect, naked man whose name escapes me... - Mmhmm. - You have no idea what Christmas was like at my house. (music, in the style of 60s-70s glam rock) ♪ The house is dressed in hues of green and red ♪ ♪ Sugarplums and grudges in our heads ♪ ♪ And in the grand old-fashioned way ♪ ♪ With the family for the day ♪ ♪ And all the wine-soaked fury simmering unsaid ♪ ♪ Everybody glows in Christmas light ♪ ♪ Everybody's itchin' for a fight ♪ ♪ And now it's Macy's on parade ♪ ♪ Clench your teeth, shut up, behave ♪ ♪ So that we can say we're doing St. Nick right ♪ ♪ Let's have a passive aggressive Christmas ♪ ♪ Let's hurt the ones who love us most ♪ ♪ We'll bitch behind each other's backs ♪ ♪ And then pretend that we're all close ♪ ♪ It's only seven hours ♪ ♪ So buckle up, strap yourself in ♪ ♪ We did it all last year and we'll do it all again ♪ ♪ Oh, aunts and uncles come to call ♪ ♪ Set 'em up and watch 'em fall ♪ ♪ And you can fake that smile all through the night ♪ ♪ Oh, and I'll match their cold and icy glare ♪ ♪ As they pick apart the clothes I wear ♪ ♪ And ask which guy I'm screwin' today ♪ - [Jinkx's Mom, drunkenly] Now sweetheart, do you want to be the one to say the blessing? ♪ And I'll say ♪ ♪ Let's have a passive aggressive Christmas ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're all stuck here 'til we're free ♪ ♪ Shouting, lying, secret crying ♪ ♪ Drunken fights around the tree ♪ ♪ So let's blast through the presents ♪ ♪ And cut the sentimental end ♪ ♪ We did it all last year and we'll do it all again ♪ ♪ Ohhhh we did it all last year and we'll do it all ♪ ♪ again ♪ ♪ Ho ♪ ♪ Ho ho ♪ ♪ Ho ho ho ♪ ♪ No ♪ So you can understand why it is so infuriating that DeLa keeps trying to push the way she feels about this holiday onto me. - So that's why you're doing the same thing to her? - What? No, no, no, no. I'm not... What? That's not what I'm... What? - I mean, sure, DeLa will never know what it's like being you, just like you'll never know what it's like being her. You both obviously have a lot of complex feelings about the holiday, but one's experience doesn't invalidate the others. I think you both could stand to have a little more patience and empathy for one another. - Fuck, man. (smacks) - Mm. - An hour ago, I didn't even know you could talk and now you're totally blowing my mind. - See, people aren't as one dimensional as you thought. Hmm. Anyways, I should probably get going. Be a good friend to DeLa. (door shuts) - Well, I guess I had more of the Holy Spirit inside me than I thought. DeLa, DeLa needs me. I gotta save Christmas! (scribbling) There's still time. There's still time! (sounds of a wintery storm) (labored breathing) (wet footsteps) (polar bear head thuds) (metal clanging) (DeLa breathing heavily) (Nanog humming "Jingle Bells") - Oh, hey Nanog. You know, this holiday special isn't going quite as I planned. (electric zaps, light slamming to ground) I just wanted to give Jinkx a perfect Christmas, but all I've done is make both of us miserable. - Tada! (giggles) That's Christmas. - What did I do wrong? - Nothing. This is it. Congratulations. - What? No, this isn't Christmas. This is terrible. - You wanted my help carrying on Christmas tradition. So you worked your fingers to the bone, made yourself sick trying to uphold some imaginary ideal of the past, tried to force someone else to do something that isn't important to them, ultimately leading to everyone feeling disappointed, resentful, and angry. - But you said that through the spirit of tradition. - I just said the spirit of tradition is how I did it. I didn't say it was good or that anyone liked it. - But I remember Christmas always being so lovely. - Oh, that's because you're drunk. - What? - Wasted. - But I thought you were virgin. - Everyone wants to believe their grandmother's a virgin. Have you not understood what the spirit of tradition is this whole time? - Oh, of course. It's like generosity and nostalgia and... - Oh, no no no no no no no no no no. It's rum. I'm extremely alcoholic. I'm drunk right now. (giggle) So are you. (giggle) - So, I only think I like Christmas. (dramatic music sting) (explosions, fire) - DeLa, DeLa! DeLa, DeLa, DeLa, DeLa, DeLa, DeLa, DeLa, DeLa, (gasps for breath) DeLa! I'm ready for our big dance number. Now I found these outfits for us. It's no burlap sack, but I think. - I tried everything. Everything to make this a sugar plum-derful evening of festi-tainment. - And I think if we go straight into the shim sham out of the lickety-split, we'll avoid getting off-rhythm With the Saskatoon Skidoo. - But nothing worked. Now I see why. (Jinkx maniacal laughing) - It was all a lie. - Now in bar 48, when you lift me over your head, remember to lift with your legs, because when you lift me with your hands, it's just not that impressive. - I stared into Rudolph's glowing red nose searching for some inkling of truth. ♪ You'll be good ♪ ♪ We'll have fun ♪ - All I found in that fiery proboscis was snot. - Lights, camera, rule of threes. And a five, six, seven, eight! (jaunty music) (DeLa crashes to the floor) (tap dancing) (thud) DeLa, something about you seems different. - I've seen the truth, the truth about Christmas. - But I thought you loved Christmas. - Turns out I've been drunk all night. - [Jinkx] Mazel. - There's something else. When you weren't looking, I, I. - What is it, DeLa? - I've been talking to the ghost of my dead grandmother who lives inside of that eggnog. (DeLa, drunkenly) I'm gonna Christmas, ha! Be a witch. (snorts) Ha, DeLa. - DeLa! (DeLa sobbing) - Yeah, that is shocking. I'm sorry you're having a rough go of it. May I ask how your grandmother passed away? - [Nanog] Mistletoe. - Mistletoe? - You can hear her too? - Yeah, I can now. I have a much higher tolerance than you, but I got there. - Nanog, mistletoe killed you? I will avenge you, Nanog. - No, I died eating mistletoe. - Whaaaa? I didn't know mistletoe was poisonous. - Oh, terribly so. - Well then why do we bring it into our homes every year, around our family and loved ones? - It's tradition. - I don't believe this. If a tradition killed you why have you been helping me carry them on? - Uh, I'm very old. I'm also kind of homophobic and a little racist. You should not be listening to me. (giggles) - You want to try the finale again? We can write it in the script. - I don't think I care about the finale anymore. I just wanted everything to be perfect. - Well, maybe you need to rethink perfect, 'cause sitting here with you feels pretty perfect. We get to define perfect for ourselves, Christmas for ourselves. My nameless trick who may have also been... nevermind, he showed me that sometimes we set limits on our future because of our past, when ding-dong, the future can be whatever we want. Fuck it, our traditions can be whatever we want, and no matter what, you're my sister DeLa. - Oh Jinkx. - And I want my traditions, whatever they may be, to be with you. Here, listen to this song. - Wait, that's how you're going to start the next song? You're just going to say listen to the son- - Shh. Shh. I'm trying to sing.

The one we chose. You're my sister, Jinkx. You're my family And you're our family because we're choosing each other right now. - What about Nanog? - Oh right, Nanog. (Jinkx giggles) - Should we try to reform her or educate her or something? - Usually I'd say yes, but she's either a hallucination or dead so. - Dump her down the drain. - Yes. (music begins, upbeat and in the style of musical-theatre) Well, Jinkx, we sure have learned a lot tonight. - We sure have. - Turns out whether you celebrate Christmas or don't celebrate Christmas, it could be a hard time of year for a lot of us. - That's true, but at least we're all miserable together. ♪ [DeLa] Everyone is traumatized by Christmas ♪ ♪ Everyone's just grinning through the cheer ♪ ♪ We start our lives all starry-eyed ♪ ♪ With childhood propaganda ♪ ♪ Then find out all those strange men's laps ♪ ♪ Were never really Santa (gasp!) ♪ ♪ Everyone is traumatized by Christmas ♪ ♪ It's almost no one's favorite time of year ♪ ♪ [Jinkx] Everyone is traumatized by Christmas ♪ ♪ And generously spreads their shit around ♪ ♪ The Jesus, songs, mangers on lawns ♪ ♪ This bullshit is incessant ♪ ♪ The Christians have the world on lock ♪ ♪ And now they want a present ♪ ♪ Everyone is traumatized by Christmas ♪ ♪ No one's safe when Santa comes to town ♪ ♪ [DeLa] No matter where you come from ♪ ♪ No matter who are ♪ ♪ [Jinkx] There's something 'bout this holiday ♪ ♪ That's sure to leave a scar ♪ ♪ An overbearing family ♪ ♪ [DeLa] No family at all ♪ ♪ [Both] Run over by a reindeer ♪ ♪ Or just working at the mall ♪ ♪ Ohhhh ♪ ♪ Everyone is traumatized ♪ ♪ By Christmas ♪ ♪ We just have our wounds gift wrapped to get by ♪ ♪ We all drown our depression in more fruitcake and wine ♪ ♪ You may feel like you're all alone ♪ ♪ But sister, get in line 'cause ♪ ♪ Everyone is traumatized by ♪ ♪ Christmastime ♪ ♪ But at least they're not alone ♪ ♪ No, at least you're not alone ♪ ♪ No, you're not alone if you've been traumatized ♪ (jolly Christmas music) (splash, swirl down drain) (upbeat holiday music plays) (ornaments shatter) (horn toots) (lights flicker and buzz, explosion) (train whistle blows) (crash sounds, fire) ('boing-oing' of jack-in-the-box) (fire roars) - [DeLa] Wait a second!
