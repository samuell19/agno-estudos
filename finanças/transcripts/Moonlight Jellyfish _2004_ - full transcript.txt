That's it. Sorry, please don't mind. It's getting hot this year. Take care. I am leaving. Rooku, where have you been? He's tough, good boy. Bastard! Michio, give it to me! The man just... Shut up and give it to me. Are you ok? 2 centimetres to hit the vitals. Seems the rumors are true. Can't let it be like this. What rumors? The groups are fighting against each other. Candy. Brother. Here you are. Broher. About the fight against each other. If you have difficulties, think about hosting him. Sorry it's abrupt. It's ok. - He'll be ok. - Thank you. Byebye. Michio. Michio. Draw the curtain, draw the curtain. Michio likes piano. You come too. OK. Don't move. Stand still. What are you doing? Yamashita, have a look at this. Hold on. What are you doing Terasa? Anyone of you follows? Hello. Byebye. Terasa. What? Nothing. Your sudden call frightened me. Sorry for asking you to come here. Nevermind, anytime. I've hosted Michio. Yes? It's the best choice both for you and Michio. Are you satisfied with yourself? Are you ok? Are you regretting? Saying this... is not unsatified. But also have nothing to be proud of. Michio, Michio is me. Though I have been taking care of him, I had the thought of the situation without him for times. I was used to living for Michio, without realizing that. The boy has something good in him. Maybe he is a gift from God. He's good at drawing. I always want to lift the curtain. Are you upset hosting him? Don't be cruel to yourself. Try to forget about Michio and look forward. To you, Michio is everything. He is the meaning of your life. Meaning of life. I wanted to protect Michio. But I didn't know when I may detest him. What? I envy Michio, who is always being concerned about. If I die, will someone cry for me sincerely? I also had no parents and lived my life all alone through. Sunny rain. You said... Don't think like that. I was just saying that you and Michio... What? Just looking, Aren't you picking up? Pick it up. Pick it up. Hello. - I am sorry, but I just left for a second and he disappeared. - When did you see him for the last time? Kidnapped or caught in an accident... Or just hanging around? Today is a festival. I'll go that way. Me too. Michio. Michio. Michio. Michio. Brother. Look. Beautiful. Here he is. - Keko. - Michio. - It's the skyrocket. - Where have you been? We are worried. - Sorry, he climbed up the roof. - Oh, we are lucky. Are you Terasa? Yes. Here's the search warranty. We need to search your base and Yamashita group. Ok. Hope you can cooperate, thanks. That... gangsterdom Just leave. No I can't. But... What should I do to live with my little brother? We have no parents and no money, relatives also left. I took this way when working on the entertainment street. You know what happened afterwards. Are you going to live like this for your rest of life? We can die together. If we are common people... What about common people? Boss of a big company, or head of a gang, what's the difference? I can't see your future like this. There are other jobs. I can help you too. Like I said just now, no one knows how long Michio can live. The situation could go worse. Even if there is no future, We still have to live and live in the dark. Do you understand? Even if there is no tomorrow, We still live for tomorrow. Who cares about nations or something else? I want pains off Michio. I want money. It's good for us- money for happiness. I could never forget the expressions in people's faces when they laughed at us. How does the life that you want look like? What's in it? The point is, How Michio will be like with you? Do we have any place we wanna go? Michio what do you wanna do? What's the happiest thing during the day, it's under the sunshine so are we just dress like this? It is not the matter of appearance if you're afraid of future but lost present, then what's the meaning of life?
