Well hello there. My name is Harry Secombe, and I play the part of Harry Jones, grocery assistant and amateur detective and I'm hot on the trail of... I'm Michael Bentine, I play the part of Professor Osrick oh dear I forgot the name, anyway I am a scientist who's just invented the bicarbonate bomb and then of course there's... Spike Milligan as Private Eccles and I just play... Nothing working out you know by thunder, not as long my name's Peter Sellers as Colonel Bloodnok, anyway, who'd you play with? Carole Carr, an MI5 girl also hot on the trail. I hope she's not on my trail because we're all. # Down down down down # # Down among the Z men we will lie # I rung for a hat. Our hats madam yes, in our lady's fashion and young maiden department. Come this way madam, please, Mr. Jones, forward. Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, forward please! Coming, coming Mr. Crabb! Serve these two ladies and drop everything else. - Yes, Mr. Crabb. - Well, really. I'm terribly sorry, I, oh! Ah, there you are, what's your pleasure? You have to but tell me, I guess I should get all the boxes out of the way first. Oh! Oh, Mr. Crabb. What can I do for you madam? I think this young lady is ahead of me. - Well. - Have you anything that would renovate an old bag? She's too far gone for that, your mother? No, no, I mean a gladstone bag. Gladstone, she's old enough to have been Desraeli's. How dare you stop this poppycock. Sorry cock, don't go away please. Young man, I want a hat. - I know what you want. - Well what do I want? You want a hat, follow me this way please. How about this one here, eh? Very sorry, gains my girl, direct from Paris. Oh and it can go back to Paris. Help, please, there's no light please. But madam, one moment please, I'm sure, madam! Fashion, hmph! It's still Tuesday. I hope you don't want a hat. No, thank you, but could I try on that bathing costume in the window? - In the window? - Mm. No, you have to use the fitting room like all the other girls, the police you know. Talking of the police, I thought you were awfully good in the play. - Really? - Yes, the black masquerader, I think it's quite the best show the Amateur Dramatic Society has put in. Well, the West Natlin District Bugle and Observer - were very kind of us. - Yeah. I've got it here, it says I know it by heart, it says Harry Jones brought Bats of the Yard to life, he played the part as though he were really a detective. It's got my picture in it, do look. Bats of the Yard, hey what's the matter with you? You're shaking like a leaf. Any mention of the police puts the wind on me. Oh, fine Secret Service agent you are. Now listen, orders are we've got to find this professor, wait till until he's finished his formula, pinch it, then bump him off. I know that, but why bring us to this dump? Well because Professor Pureheart... - Who? - Pureheart, with a black bushy beard, he's camping around here somewhere. That's why we're here. - Which field? - How should I know? That's what we're here to find out. Here, let's ask every one of those shops up there, you never know, he might have been in for provisions or something, come on. Yes, I really lived my parts. - Mm-hmm. - You know, I think I am by nature a detective. - Yeah. - Remember that scene where I tackled the spy in Act Three? - I really go for him, you know. - Oh yeah, yeah. - Oh! - Oh, sorry Mr. Crabb. Provision counter! Back among the teas where you belong. I'll handle this lady. - Now madam. - Well if you've a nice dress length, something summery. Yes, yes of course madam. Here one our best pieces here. Was there any particular colour? Oh something like gold. - Do you have some? - Yes, indeed madam. I think you'll find one of these very suitable. Expecting a great deal more in another month, but the deliveries are so uncertain. Now madam, this is I measured 20 here, a good linen finish, you'll never see... Hi liddily giddelin, what can I do for you? I have a nice line in sweeps, nice line in pies, a nice line in baking... He's got a nice line in talk. All we want is some information. Information, oh, here's a little paper. That's me on the front page. So you're Bats of the Yard. - That's right. - Just one of the - local boys, eh? - Local, I'm homegrown. Yeah, now look we want to know if you've seen a black-bearded gentleman. He's a funny sort of bloke, sort of a scientist. He hasn't been in here by any chance has he? You mean he's a crook, like the black masquerader? - No no no, now... - Yes, yes. That's it and we've got to get hold of him. - I know who you are. - What? You're a couple of detectives on the trail of a dangerous criminal. You see, he's stolen a secret formula and is masquerading as the real professor. So that's why you asked if I was a local boy, eh, superintendent? Correct, now listen, we've got to get this bloke, because he's camping around here. Well you couldn't have asked anyone better. If he comes in here, I'll let you know straight away. Good, we'll be in the local pub. Don't worry fellas, you can count on me colleagues. The minute he comes in here, I'll be right... - Jones, forward. - Coming Mr. Crabb. Excuse me, now he's calling, Mr. Crabb. What is all this about superintendent and colleagues and all that? Don't you understand? This clot is detective mad. He thinks we're a couple of flatties. - Oh no! - Listen, he's gonna be very useful to us, he can do all the hard work tracking this Pureheart bloke while you and I take it easy. Come on. Well, I think it will work. Yes, I think that should be very nice. - Oh yes. - And now measure the waist, - Mr. Crabb. - No no no, her waist. I'm sorry, yes Mr. Crabb, oh I'm sorry. Nine and a half, big head. Waist here, 73, dieting? Yes, now I want a big drape in the back here. You've got a big drip in the front. - That'll do! - Mr. Crabb, it's a gag, gag Mr. Crabb, Mr. Crabb. Now that'll do, just tear it off there. Just tear it off, okay. No, I think I better start from the bottom now. Yes it would be better thank you. I'm so pleased about this material, I've been looking for this for ages. Yes, it's pretty nice isn't it? A shot back in time, the shade. We'll send the garment the very day we make it madam. - Thank you. - Thank you so much. - Good day. - Good day madam. Madam, madam. Oh, good morning. Now tell me that young lady leaving just now seems the right outfit for the warm weather. Did she get it here? Well, I sort of helped. Yeah, now tell me, do you think an outfit like that would suit me? What, with those legs? And what's the matter with my legs? Nothing, nothing, well what's on your mind? Apart from your hair. On my mind, a formula my dear son. - A formula? - Yes. Then you're the professor. Yes, I am, yes, how do you do? Ah, I hate scissors. Harris, I got it, the formula, the formula. - Quick, paper! - Paper! Paper, paper and a pencil, paper, come on, and pencil, here we are, you got one, now we've got to be careful now... No, not that side, that's the press cutting, yeah. All right, that side. Oh, I shall need my reading glasses for this. Here, oh that's much better. Professor, I don't need glasses. Oh really? No, neither do I. X squared. Well we haven't got square eggs. We've got some round ones, some egg-shaped eggs, they're Australian eggs from down under. - Y. - Why not? That's where they come from, down under, you see. Chicken. - R U 1. - Am I one what? - And this, pi, pi. - Pie, yes, there we are. - X to the square root. - Well, we haven't any square root, arrowroot you mean. Yes, yes, 15, 18, 24, that's it, I got it, I got it. That's it, I got it, I got it, I got it. What are you doing now? - You're fired! - Oh, Mr. Crabb, please don't fire me Mr. Crabb, think of my six starving children, Mr. Crabb. You haven't got any children. I know, but if I had they'd starve. Mr. Crabb, please you can't fire me. I'll give you one more chance. Go and collect that 20 pounds the Grand Public House owes me and bring the money back, every penny of it. I will, Mr. Crabb, I will. You'd better, my last assistant embezzled some money, Stubbens and I prosecuted. - Prosecuted? - Prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law. He got five years, I was on the bench. Oh, you'll get your money back Mr. Crabb. I'll bring it back to you Mr. Crabb. Do it now. And take that wretched paper out of here with your photograph in it. It's enough to frighten away every customer for miles. Bats of the Yard, the professor, the black masquerader, the pub... 18, 19, 20 and tell Mr. Crabb I thought he'd give me more credit, - trade being so bad. - Him? He never gives anybody any credit, the mean old punisher. Yes, gentleman what can I get you? - A couple of large... - Two pints of beer, please. Very good, sir. Just the fellas I wanted to see. I've just seen him, the black masquerader. - Who, the professor? - I think it was him, superintendent, he came in just after you had left the shop. He did, eh? Come on, tell me more. Well, he's camping around here somewhere. He came in for some arrowroot, some eggs. Did he do anything else before he left? He was something about physics or something. Yeah, and what was he wearing? Bats of the Yard. That'll be three shillings sir. I think I'll have a large whiskey. - Yes. - What'll you have? Thank you sir, I'll have the same. Don't forget him, if you trace him, - let us know at once. - Bats of the yard never forgets, well goodbye, goodbye. Don't forget your wallet. Oh my gosh, no, there's no 20 quid of Mr. Crabb's money in there. - There is? - Yes. And they said if I don't bring back every penny, he'd get me five years. Well, well, we'll be seeing you sometime. - Yes, goodbye. - Goodbye. Why don't you keep your mind on your job instead of lifting that poor rub's cash, you want to concentrate on lifting the professor's formula and you won't find it in a half-wit's wallet. I'm sorry, Spiner, it was dead easy. In any case, before we get the formula, we've got to find the professor. - Oh yeah. - I wonder where the heck he is. The formula, what happened with the formula? Oh wait a minute, here, here, no that's not it. Ack, the truck, that'll be it. No, no, no, no, the formula, ah, here it is. No, no, no, I've lost the formula. I've lost the formula, I must have that formula. Where's the formula? I've lost the formula, I've lost the formula. Ah, I've lost it, where's the formula? The formula, what happened to the formula? - No, no, no. - Gas bombs, I'll carry that. Nah, it's this one. Dear sir, we are eagerly awaiting your arrival at Warwell, and all arrangements have been made for you to work in the utmost secrecy. Once the formula is in our hands, we should endeavour to get the new weapon into production immediately, Warwell Atomic Research Station. Hey, hey, what are you doing here? You vile beast, what are you doing in my camp? Ooh, I'll get you, I'll get you, I'll have your life for this. Ah, you stinking beast. I say, answer that old thing will you? That's been ruining my sleep since the brink of dawn. Hello, yes, this is Official Secrets. Can I help you? Yes, I like your voice too. My name? Oh, that's an official secret. Who am I talking to, who? Oh blimey, it's the CNC, he wants Dunnit. - Who's done what? - No, the CNC. - What's he done? - Nothing, he must - have Dunnit. - But you just said - he didn't do it. - He wants Dunnit. - Hold on, sir, our Dunnit. - My dear girl, you can't say our Dunnit, they Dunnit, we Dunnit, I Dunnit, oh you mean damn it that's done it. Switch board, I say confound it just call Brigadier Dunnit well, well? Yeah. What the blazes do you mean by ringing me up this time of night? Oh, oh I beg your pardon sir. Yes, sir. Professor Pureheart, sir. Oh yes, sir, yes sir, our very best man, sir. Very good, sir, goodbye sir. - Feathers! - Dithers, sir! Oh, well done, now listen there's one of these atomic professor fellows on his way to Warwell, well anyway, we've got to protect him. Now there's an ITC at Warwell. I suggest we send him down there as guest of the Colonel's, you'll have to send one of our people down there to shadow them. The question is to whom can we give the job? Well, sir, it's rather difficult sir. You see all our special secret service agents are who deuced well-known sir. Mm, I got it, here, you there, what's your name? Carole Gayley, sir. Are you aware of this atomic fellow, Pureheart? - Yes sir. - Well they appear to want to kill him and it's gonna be your job to stop them. Yes, sir. I suggest you get into civilian docks, in fact, I bet you better do that right away. You better get down to the ITC at Warwell and report to the CO. - Very good sir. - Pretend to be his daughter or something, is that clear? Yes, sir. And remember, this is absolutely secret. Yes sir. Don't breathe a word of this to anybody. Any news, RSN? I'm afraid not sir, the new officer left the office some hours ago. Well, what the devil are we supposed to do? An intake of the infantry service due here at any time, and I've got no adjutant. I know sir. And now to cap it there's this VIP fellow on his way too. - On his way to where sir? - Here, man, here. I can't think what the War Office is up to. They send me a civilian scientist you know, but they don't send me an adjutant. He, he must have been delayed on the road sir. You'll pay for this, how dare you put on my uniform. It fits all right. I warn you, I shall have the hell of British army around... - Ah, shut up. - Once I get to Warwell. You're gonna have a long walk ahead of you tummy, because I'm gonna borrow your car as well. I say you can't take that. I can't see without it. You're not going to see, star dust, all right adjutant? Now for old Pureheart and his formula. Feels fine to get into uniform. I must say it feels good to get out of uniform. Oh, there you are my dear. By George, you look even prettier in front of me. Thank you. I was just cursing the War Office for not sending me an adjutant, but by gad, they've made up for it, they've sent me a daughter. There's just one thing. When the professor arrives, you'd better leave him to me. I'm a bit worried about someone getting undercover of this new Z draught. Oh yes, that's a point, yes. Or for that matter of someone giving away the fact that he's there. Hmm, yes, well don't worry about it. I shall see that they don't talk. Give me a short chat on security some time. Yes, what is it RSN? Private Eccles, sir, usual request for promotion board. Eccles, not him again. Six years that man's been trying to get a stripe. He's very keen sir. Is he, hm, well that's something. All right, I'll see him. Excuse me a moment, my dear. He'll see you now, come on, right turn, the other right. Quick march. Halt! Private Eccles, sir. You don't salute with your cap off you know. Now then, Eccles, unfortunately I've not seen my way before to promote you towards corporal. There are some privates you know who are keen, but not very intelligent. There are sir? Yes, there are. But in your case, I'm gonna give you a chance to prove that you're not one of them. Yeah, that's what I am. - What? - Not one of them. Yes, now then I'm going to make you PT Instructor, acting unpaid of course, in charge of the draught. Oh, the Z Men, sir? No, Z Girls, there's a dozen or so recs joining us. Ooh hoo hoo. And there's no sort of time for that sort of thing. If you're going to make an efficient NCO, you'll have to learn how to use your voice. Oh, but I do use my voice, sir. I use it every time I speak. I wouldn't use it any other way. I meant words of command. Go away and practise somewhere and don't whisper, shout! Yes sir! Come lads, quick march, left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, advance, turn, company forward march. Lovely year and time for the weather, isn't it? Oh, I see you're an MP, tell me what is your constituency? Congregational, sir. Yeah, heh, well is there a Colonel Bloodnok in residence? I don't know anything about that sir, - but he's in house. - Oh splendid. Which way? Straight down the road, first turn on the right, - and you can't miss it. - Yes. With my driving I shall quite probably hit it. Yes. Good afternoon, welcome to Warwell, I'm the CO's daughter. - Oh splendid, splendid. - You're Mr. Whitehead - of course. - I'm Pureheart, I'm sure... Down here you'll be known as Mr. Whitehead. The fact that you're here in this cab must be kept absolutely secret. Oh I see, I use an assumed name and pretend to be somebody that I'm not. Exactly, let's go in, shall we? - Yes. - This way. Oh. Hey my boy, you're on to something, now can I get in the cab to watch him? If you're talking to yourself, don't do it and if you're talking to me, shut up! - Yes, but I just... - Don't answer back, stand to attention, will you! What are you doing outside the CO's house anyway? Get in with the rest of the Z men. - I'm not a Z man, I'm... - Don't argue with me, insolent! At the moment, I'm working on a new form of gas. Really? Two kinds in fact, a tear gas and a laughing gas. Hm, then I suggest we tell the men that you're a gas warfare expert, Mr. Whitebread. Whitehead, sir. Whitehead, yes, yes. Then none of them will ever suspect that you're really connected with Warwell Atomic Station. Well that's the real trouble. You see, there's no real reason why anyone should want to try and kill me. You see I've lost the formula. - What? - Well I wrote it - down somewhere. - Good heavens. - You don't know where it is? - Alas no. I've got to remember, I must. - Sorry to interrupt sir. - Do I know you? I'm Evans, the new adjutant. - Oh well. - I had a tyre blow out on the way down, very serious delay I'm afraid. Yes, very serious, still you're here now, just in time to take in the new draught. By the way, this is my daughter, Carole. - How do you do? - How do you do? - How do you do? - And this is Mr. Whitehog. - Warthog sir. - How do you do? How do you do, sir? Oh yes, yes, you better get off and see to that draught, your room is ready upstairs, and yours Mr... Satish. Wetwhite, yes that's right. Now then you'll need a batmen won't you? We shall need two in fact. Tell the RSN to pick out a couple, will you? Very good sir. You've all been in the service before. You should know all the answers without me having to tell you. Don't hurry yourself, will you? You've got all day. Get in there, will you. Who do you think you are? - I think I'm bat. - I know you are. - What's your name? - Harris. - Harris! - It's not necessary, but thanks all the same. By Jiminy, I'll! The first thing to do is to get you kitted up. Anyone know where the quartermaster's stores are? No? Right, then I'll march you down there myself. Now don't forget the old words of command. Squad! Wait for it! As you were, squad, set at ease. Now then, squad! Wait for it, if you've got anything in your legs. - Sir? - Well. I shouldn't be it at all really. I know you shouldn't, the other 12 are bad enough with you making it a lucky 13. As squad, head down. Follow along and march. Forward march, left, right, left, right, and heel, left, heel. Oh yes, about turn, squad halt. Forward for a smoke. Left, right, ahead. Left, right, left, right. Squad left. Well, left, right, left, right, left, right ahead. Squad, halt. New draught sir. Not very of them are there? About turn. About turn. Excuse me, sir. Squad dismiss. Get back in there, the army will think you're a, you sons of a, I'll have you all in chains for this. - They're here, hurry. - What does that mean? The lead. Get on, hurry up, come on, hurry, come on, hurry. Oh, go away. Well, if he can't get you up, I will. You, what do you think you're playing at? It wasn't me, sir. I'll give you 28 days for this. Report to the guard room, you're on a charge. Yes, sir, but sir... Don't answer back, I've never heard nothing like it all me life. Well, I bet that woke them up, certainly good I am. You certainly woke me up, what time is it? - Half past five. - Half past five? - Yep. - I don't get up till 8:00. Ah, but you're in the army now. No, I'm not, I came here by error in the first place. We all came here by error in the first place. But you don't understand, I'm a detective really. I'm on a Secret Service mission, I'm Bats. So am I, but I'm getting over it. No no Bats of the Yard, here I'll show you. I got my photograph here in the paper. - In the paper? - Yep. Well how'd you do that? Look at that. Bats of the Yard. Ooh, yeah, anything on the back? Hey what are these figures here? - Figures? - Yeah. Oh, that must be an old grocery list that I was writing up for old Mr. Crabb. - Oh. - Old Mr. Crabb, the 20 quid I collected from the club. I have to get back. He said he'd get me five years if I lost it. Oh, the army won't let you go now. But they must, I got 20, 20 pounds. 20 quid, I've been robbed, I'm a wanted man. - Who wants you? - The police. They'll arrest me. What? They all say I was mentally arrested. Not you, look, I can't show my face outside the barrack gates. I can't show my face anywhere. Wakey, wakey, rise and shine, the sun's burning your eyes out. Wakey, wakey, wakey, you horrible men. What are you hanging around in here for? Get cleaned up and shaven up right will you? Don't stand here all day looking at your pinups. What's he mean about pinups? - These? - Oh no, not them. He means these. We all have them over our beds you know. Ain't you got something to pin up over your bed? - Yes, I have. - What? - This. - Oh! Now my dear chap, it's no good going for me. I can't help it, we'll just have to wait. The old fool's lost the formula. - How'd you know? - The first thing I ever heard when I got down here. He said, I wrote it down somewhere and I can't remember where. - Ah they you are my friend. - Quick, into the hutch. - What's on today? - Guerrilla warfare. - Guerrilla warfare? - Yeah. - I know that. - You do? - Fall in. - Fall in, right. By George, more like soldiers this morning, you spot-scouted willow rats, not much more, but we'll soon order that. And the first thing this morning is to get two volunteers for batmen. One for a new adjutant, one for the new gas expert, Mr. Wideface. Volunteers for batmen, two paces forward, march! Blimey, arsenic and old lace, right you two, report to the CO's office immediately. Can I speak sir? Not very well, apparently, but what is it? Well, the CO said that I could take the women's PT class this morning. So he did, right, that first and then come back and go there and follow the adjutant. What does that make me sir? The same! You've got a lot of decorations up this morning, Eccles. Oh you mean these medals? What do you got these four? You really want to know what I got them for? Yes. 10 bulbs a lot. Silence! The rest of you in a PT kit. I'll have a go at you lots, we'll soon stiffen up those flabby muscles. You two right turn, right turn! Quick march! The actual action of sodium solicitate on a benzoate solution. Hm, it all sounds very interesting Blackhead. Whitehead, Whitehead. Whitehead, yes, yes, you've managed to get both tear gas and laughing gas into a condensed form, is that it? Yes, as it were squeezed, squeezed, I suspect I have two samples upstairs in my room. - Daddy, daddy. - Hm, oh huh? Couldn't the professor give the men a lecture or something? Yes, hydrogen ring concentration in trichotal fedimithyne onrecelical concentrations rates or mother crust. Yes, you know it would give a chance to know the new draftees. Hm, well I don't think we want to bore them with all that dribble about oh I don't know, we might as well, yes. Why not, I'll go upstairs and collect - the things from my room. - Yes, righto. - Right. - Right, fine. - Excuse me. - Yes. - More tea, daddy? - Yes. You know I'm rather beginning to like this daddy business. - Sugar daddy? - My dear yes. - Milk? - Of course. - Tea? - No thanks, - I never touch the stuff. - Oh. - Blimey, was that him? - Yes. - With all those whiskers? - Why not? He's a bulbous nightmare. Well there's one thing said, I shan't mistake him when I come to do him. Ooh! Hey there, would you all kind of nice to fall in. - One. - Two. - Three. - Four. - Five. - Six. - Seven. - Eight. - Nine. - 10. - 11. - 12. Hoo hoo, that was fine, fine, fine. And now we'll try, oh ho, now we'll try exercise number one, now do it exactly as I do, all right you all, watch me. One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four. Now then, exactly as I did it, all together, ready go! One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four, one, two. That's very good. Something wrong here, oh yes. Three, four, that's fine, fine, fine. And now then we'll try it with music, eh. Music, oh. Here wait a minute, have you got the right record on? I think so. I don't know. Hang on a minute. Oh, that was wonderful girls, absolutely wonderful and now we're gonna have another exercise, so get the rings, come now now, hurry up, all together now. Don't waste any time. Come now now, get in place there, Cynthia, Mary, June, Penelope. Now then this is what you do, you swing them to the left and swing them to the right... And grab your partner and doozy do. No, no, no, hold on, now then, this is what you do, you swing them to the left and swing them to the right, okay? Ready, one, two, three go. Swing to the left and no no, give them to me, Penelope. Now then this is what you do now, exactly as I do it. You swing them to the left, and swing them to the right, okay? Good girl, count down exactly as I did it. Now ready, one, go, you swing them to the left, and swing them to the right. Halt, left turn. These two men have volunteered as batmen sir. One for the adjutant... And one for his knob. Silence! Matter of fact, his knob's not a bad description for old Weltbreast or whatever his confounded name is. Silence! You might find out where he is, would you Evans? Very good sir. I think he's upstairs on my right you know. Well, I'll find out, hello, Whitehead one two one two, anybody there? No, there's nobody there. Silence! - The gas canisters. - The gas, you've dumped the gas! Of course you'll have to polish his buttons, make his bed, run his bath and so on, but it's one of the most sought after jobs in the army. I think you'll find you'll be very happy here. Yes sir, yes sir. Thank you sir, it's very nice. That's all right. No need to take it to heart. After all, we all want to be happy now men. Don't we, major? Yes, we all want to be happy. Of course we must have discipline. And I leave that to you, don't I, RSN? Yes sir. - I know what I can do sir. - What? I can give them fatigues. Put them in chains. And then double around their legs. I'm terribly sorry. This is all my fault. He says it's all his fault. Yes, it's all my fault. I didn't mean it. You know what I say, major. Come along now. Private Jones, whatever is the matter? Oh come now, army life can't be as bad as all that. It's not that. Well what is it then? A love affair gone wrong? No. Oh, you just need a little womanly sympathy. Now come on smile, just for me. I'll try. That's it, now come on, just a teeny weeny smile. That's it. Well, really! - Oh, that gas. - Gas? Professor's laughter and tears mixture. Oh, I'm sorry miss wouldn't like to offend you of all people. I understand. You're so understanding and kind, and sympathetic. Think so? Ah, but sympathy can be a dangerous thing you know. # Sympathy is the strangest feeling # # Takes you by surprise # # And before you realise # # What's happening, that other thing # # Comes stealing too # # Love is on its way # # What can you do but shrug and say # # If this is love # # Then let it stay # # It's much too sweet # # To turn away # # If this is love # # Then I shall be # # In love with you # # Eternally # # Please understand # # I never planned # # That love should start like this # # You took my hand # # And in that moment # # Took my heart # # Now take my limbs # # And come what may # # If this is love # # We'll let it stay # # You took my hand # # And in that moment took my heart # # Now take my limbs # # And come what may # # If this is love # # We'll let it stay # # If this is love # # We'll let it stay # Now then general as I was saying... I've asked you to come here. I've asked you to come here on a very important matter. It'll affect everyone, oh ho. Oh that's better, that's better. Now then I've received information from the War Office that says that certain secret documents... Oh, it was really bad, so is that all clear gentleman? I'm sorry, sir, we didn't quite catch the... I was saying Bullshire, I've had information from the War Office that a dangerous spy has penetrated this camp and he's trying to get hold of a secret formula which belongs to the Warwell Atomic people. It is essential therefore that none of your men talk. Careless talk may mean disaster. We don't know who the spy is, probably got in with the last Z intake. We can screen those men sir. Hm, yes, but it may be a woman disguised as a RAC or something? I would like to remind you gentleman that one of the world's most famous spies was a woman, Mata Hari. She was a particularly clever woman, very, very beautiful, a singer if you remember, who by showing sympathy and using all her feminine allure got young soldiers under her spell. They believed her to be their friend and from them she got their secrets. Have we a Mata Hari amonst us? Is there a woman spy on this camp? Well, that is all gentleman. Keep your eyes open and above all, see that your men don't talk. Do you wish to attend hall inspection, sir? Oh, that's a good idea, like to have the place looking spartan. We'll go along, shall we? No, nothing's broken yet. It's the formula that's holding up everything. Once Pureheart gets his back again, the balloon will go up and the professor will be taken for a ride. Yes, yes, I'll let you know. - Good bye. - Caught red-handed. So you thought by sympathy and all of your feminine allure you'd get me under your spell. What on Earth are you talking about? The game's up, Mata Hari, I'm Bats. You're telling me! I know all about you masquerading as the colonel's daughter about Pureheart pretending to be Whitehead, about the formula, about bumping people off and taking people for rides and everything, I'm the world's greatest detective. Yes. Now look Jimsy, you apparently know a good deal, so you can help. I'm not a Mata Hari, I'm MI5 Gayley. MI5? Yes, now you know there's going to be a concert tonight. Well the attempt will be made then when everyone's at the hall. Now the spies have tried to get hold of the missing formula, but no one knows where it is. Yes, not bad. Not bad at all. But these pinups or whatever you call them, those will have to come down. Can't have those up, can we? - No sir. - Not regulation. Make a note of that, RSN, will you? - Very good sir. - But sir, we dream about these. You do? Give me that one. - This one? - Yes. - How about that one? - I said this one here. Disgusting. - Revolting. - Yes, nauseating. This one's even worse, give me that. Yes sir. What do you do with this, have nightmares about it? Bats of the Yard, it seems horrible. You know it's funny, that photo looks familiar. I wonder where I saw it before. Oh look there's some figures on the back. It seems to be some sort of a formula. - Yes. - A formula? - Yeah. - Can I see it? - Yeah, certainly. - I don't suppose it's important, but I'd better keep it. RSN, remind me to see Private Jones and tell him not to pin his press cuttings up in the hut. Very good sir. You can carry on now, RSN. I'm going to finalise these concert arrangements. Now you better come with me Eccles. Oh good, I like concerts sir you know, been to lots of concert, Danny Kaye's one. Move! Bah! De dado lay, hippide dado lay, gallop, gallop again, leave it to gallop again, hippide dado lay, hippide dado lay hippi de gallop gallop again, hippi dado lay. Yes, well that seems to be okay. - Yes sir. - Well now Stanton how long does this act of yours run? About 10 minute sir. - 10 minutes? - Yes, sir. You can't make all those changes of costume in 10 minutes. Well you see sir it's a quick change act. I'm sorry, I don't see how it can be done. I'll show you sir, ready Bert? Yeah. Monsieur, Cyrano de Bergerac and every change as quick as that. - Okay, that's fine Mr. Bergerac, uh, Stanton. Now what's next? The girls, ah, all right chaps get this stuff off as quickly as you can. - Eccles. - Sir. Get your girls down here as quick as you can. - Come on girls. - Line up here. Come on girls, follow the script girls. - Penelope, come right here. - All right, come on, come on. All right, go ahead, yes sir, all right, sir? Hello professor is everything all right? Yes. Ah, that face, I've seen it somewhere before recently. I've got it, you're Bats in the Belfry. - Bats of the Yard. - Yeah, that's it. The newspaper cutting, the figures on the back, - that's my formula! - The formula! Yes, yes, I remember now I was in a grocery shop and you were in the grocery shop, you were laying square eggs. But the formula, who's got it now? Ah, the adjutant. - The adjutant? - Yes. Signed, sealed and almost delivered. So now we can get busy with old Pureheart, eh? You can, but not just yet. I don't want to arouse any suspicion. I'll put this under lock and key and then try and get in touch with headquarters. But why can't I do in old Pureheart now? Because there'll be a much better chance tonight when they're all busy at the concert. The file officer turned to the air commodore, he said, " You know sir, we can't land a sea plane "on an run way, don't you?" And the air commodore said, "I'm perfectly "well aware of that," got up, opened the door, fell in the sea and hasn't been heard of since. There you go, glass there. Well ladies, I think we might as well be getting across, pretty good cheer they've fixed up for us so I'm told. Your daughter's signing isn't she colonel? My who, daughter? Oh yes, yes, she is, a couple of songs I believe. Anyway, when the adjutant arrives we'll get across shall we? I believe he's gone over already sir. He has, well, we're go now in that case. I always thought it was tremendously entertaining. The men do so well. Very good, girls, very, very good, hurry along now. Oh dear, I'm on next. Now look, hold the floor for me. As soon as I'm through, I'm going over to the get formula back before my second number. - Shall I come too? - No, you stay here. Fill me in for me if I don't get back in time. - Okay. - Okay. # Here's the story, a sad and dismal tale # # Of a fall from blazing glory of a miserable male # # He was tall, dark, handsome as could be # # And the ladies always looked upon him lovingly # # But tall, dark and handsome was called upon to serve # # His country for a fortnight in the Z reserve # # He was proud, please, how could he foresee # # The sort of things that happen in the Queen's army # # For when he arrived the sergeant major swore # # I've never seen anything like it in my life before # # His smart civic suit was cut so square # # With a drape up the back and so was his hair # # The colonel then was heard to pry # # Down among the Z men, down the among the Z men # # Down down down down down among the Z men, let him lie # # They thrust both his feet into thick army socks # # They cruelly chopped off his long, black locks # # When a battle dress replaced his smartly cut suits # # His shoulders were no wider than his big army boots # # And then was heard his anguished cry # # Down among the Z men, down among the Z men # # Down down down down # # Down among the Z men, let him lie # # The ladies who with love were torn # # Now pretended not to know him, all laughed with scorn # # There's a martyr tale that's plan to see # # The shape nature made him a man must be # # For he must hear the ladies cry # # Down among the Z men, down among the Z men # # Down down down down # # Down among the Z men, let him lie # And now ladies and gentleman, for our surprise item. You've heard the colonel's charming daughter. Now here is the colonel himself, Colonel Bloodnok. Ladies and gentleman, the other day I went along to the cinema, I love the cinema to see one of these American war films and in this American war film, there was a young lieutenant, we know them as lieutenant, who endeavoured to save the day save the whole army from entire destruction. You see he wasn't very successful and that is why I'm going to show you a little burlesque now of what happened. I'd like you to imagine the scene in a battlefield inside a rather battle-scared headquarters and there are three high-ranking American officers standing around a table and they call this young lieutenant into the room, it goes like this. Lieutenant Hargraves. Lieutenant. I have call you here because we are in a very, very grave position. Yes, sir. We are not only completely, oh, one moment, lieutenant, hello, HQ, yes, we're the and another thing goodbye. Lieutenant, we are not only completed surrounded by units of the 15th Panzer Division, but they are at this very moment lieutenant surrounding and penetrating our main defence line. Yes, sir, gentleman, it's a good thing you called me in. I can get you all out of this. My plan is very simple, permission to speak sir? Thank you sir. Now then we are here and the enemy is here. Now then what happens is this, they attack not knowing I'm working for them you see. I close in, my men, mm. Oh, good evening, ladies and gentleman. I've actually come here this evening to try and sell you this lovely old antique chair on behalf of an absolutely smashing cause of a charity, in actual fact it is on behalf of those incredibly brave lads of the civil service that in our country's hour of the direst need, they threw down the pen and then they took up the gun and gosh, got a got a few ideas, exactly the self same chaps sort of sweating it out and working away in the fields the factories and the forests in order to keep our glorious splendid empire still flying. You see, you see, you hold in your hands the key, the golden key, then why don't you turn it and unlock the door to this, oh would you flatly mind if I closed the door, there's a heck of a draught. Wouldn't you rather that we all went forth together united as one and booked a new road to right here. Gentleman, you generous impulses go handcuffed, will it be marked deaf, marked deaf in a pillory of shame? No my friends, not whilst the milk of human kindness flows in your veins. Can't you see, in our ship yards today, they're trying to build a mighty new vessel of steel, then let us launch it and let it slide slowly down the slip way towards the ocean. The ocean with all its ocean ocean shall then, shall then this great ship of steel move rudderless through the turbulent meadows of fortune, or wouldn't you rather put your hands to the plough and guide it along the straight and and. I believe it was someone who said, "Strong walls do not the prison make, "nor the iron bars the cage, "but look, look into the mirror." Come at, come at the tangled web of political apathy and as the shreds of despair cast them off, and then let the great music of adoration pluck, pluck at the heart strings and with one, the cold, clear clarion call make a desperate bid, for these schillings, I thank you very much for this. Everything's going fine and the professor's round the back of the stage, as soon as he comes out, get him. Right. Now where's Stanton, are his clothes ready? Oh yes, all ready behind the screen. He goes out first to make his opening spiel, then I have his first change all ready. Good fine, there he is now. Good evening, ladies and gentleman. It gives me great pleasure to present to you this evening, a character sketch in which I play no fewer than 10 different characters in as many minutes. In civilian life, I played this sketch before all the crowned heads of Europe and I hope sincerely it gives you as much pleasure as it gave them. We start with that great character from history, Cyrano de Bergerac. Fools who think to taunt me that, my nose, this nose that grows like some enchanted rose from out the earthy contours of my face is something to be mocked, has it not grace? What other nose than this can boast such strength, such grandeur, such enormity, such length, my tears of gratitude for such a one, standing trembling in my eyes, but do not run a gasp at such a journey. Mr. Crabbs, the 20 quid, he's got a copper with him. I'm getting out of here, come on. Of my nose and when I clasp a maiden in my arms lying to my nose, for I have other charms, should we stop for fear someone's behind some peeping Tom, I see to ease her mind, fear not, 'tis but this that's breathing down your back, the nose of Cyrano de Bergerac. Now you stop there and wait for the crooks and I'll go upstairs and look for Carole, okay? Right. Got it. Woo hoo. That's fine, take that. My poor head. Blimey, I ought to charge him for a bear skin rug. - Where is he? - Here I am. Help, oh police, doggone criminals , you thug, help! Excuse me, sir. I'm looking for a man named Jones. He's a Welsh fellow. He's stolen 20 pounds of mine and I'd like to see that he gets 10 years. 10 years is it, a long time, is it? I mean 10 years is a long time, is it? 10 years, name is Jones you say? - That's right. - Welsh you say. - Yes. - Well I've seen not an ounce of him, I'll tell you. - Try the grounds. - Right sir. It's all right, professor, I've got the formula back and I've given it to the CO. I'm not the professor. - Harry. - Jones. Well where's the real professor? Upstairs with the folks, everybody else is. Oh well done, lads, well done, so they were the spies. What should we do with them? Take my advice and leave them where they are. # Down # # Down # # Down # # Down # # Down among the Z men, let them lie #
