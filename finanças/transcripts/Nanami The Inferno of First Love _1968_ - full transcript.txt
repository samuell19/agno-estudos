A FILM BY SUSUMU HANl But isn't it expensive? Don't worry. I have money. Everybody does this, you know. - And if they find out? - find out what? That we are underage. Let's do it some other time. But we're almost there - Well... - Well what? - You know... - What is it? -This is my first time. - Really? Do you want to see nude models? Your fate is written in your palm. Come on in, you won't regret it. This line shows that you are very sensitive. Your love life is very demanding. When did your skin become that beautiful? You don't make it with me only. -You think it will work? - Don't be afraid. Do you have big breasts? INFERNO OF FIRST LOVE My name is Shun, what's yours? I?m Nanami. Short time? Yes. Want a bath? No, thank you. Make yourself comfortable. Won't you kiss me? I?ll get undressed. Aren't you cold? No, I?m used to it. Used to it? I?m a nude model. But... What? Nothing. What? Say it. This is like a dream. You can do whatever you like. I?ll close the curtains. What is it? It?s tickling. You may. What is it? I?m thirsty ''Attention! Fire risk! No smoking in bed!'' This is really your first time? Not even with a prostitute? Do I look like that? You're not very sure of yourself. You're only young once. Youth only comes once so if you're a man. Do it- do what the others can't do. What the others can't do? Don't we all do the same thing? Why do you close your eyes when you kiss me? I?m shy. Don't you want to see, if I have my eyes shut? - No. - But you are sure of yourself. No, I?m not. But you had a girlfriend, didn't you? No. - When was your first love? - First love? - Do you want to talk for a while? -Talk? I want to know more about you. About me? My father died when I was seven years old. My father died when I was seven years old. The year I first went to school. My mother married a boxer and left me alone. They didn't have a real wedding ceremony. The night she left, she said to me: ''Forgive me!'' I forgave her. When I was little, I was naughty. They sent me to reform school. People said I was ''hopeless''. Then a couple named Otagaki took me away. These kind of people are called benefactors. They didn't adopt me, but I call them father and mother. My stepfather is a goldsmith. I was his apprentice. Now, I?m his journeyman. I am a good goldsmith. But I?m very reserved. Therefore my father sent me to laugh lessons It was supposed to make me happier. ''All right now! All together!'' What do you do usually? Usually? On your days off. Go to the park and feed the pigeons. I am grateful to my father. Someday I?m going to have to pay back my obligation. After all, I?m kind of a criminal, and though I?m not his own child, ...he raised me. Today, both went on a trip, ...and therefore I have a day off. I?ve got a friend, too. A friend? Yes, a little girl friend. Once she asked if she could hide between my legs while she was playing hide and seek. She has a lot of freckles. Since that day, we are friends. She was the only friend I ever had before you. I was born in Shizuoka. I came to Tokyo with a group of employees. First, I worked in a shoe factory. But they didn't pay enough. ''Why's a girl?s mother... like a girl?s girdle?'' ''Because they both stick to her.'' Since the money wasn't enough, I found a job at a nude studio. A friend of mine knew the owner. Mama-san told me, that it's pretty hard work. And that everything depends on my figure. I was frightened at first. But everybody told me I was really good. To be honest, I really thought I had a nice body. Then I acquired some steady customers. Like Mr. Ankokuji - he has a beard. He says I?m the best in Shinjuku. He knows everybody. He looks stern, but when he smiles his whole face lights up. But don't worry, he means nothing special to me. But a nude modeling job can't be all that nice. People always think it's a very bad job. But I don't care about that. We're good girls. See you again, Nanami. Going? - well, come back soon. - See how much money I?ve saved. - Yes. I think it?s a lot of money. Well, we haven't much time left. Shun, do you want me? Would you like to try again? What is it? What do you think? Do I look funny? Everything feels so curious to me. I feel embarrassed. You're holding back, aren't you? Shall we try again some time? Yes. - Aren't I attractive? - What? Aren't I sexy? Very sexy We're going now. Sorry, wrong door. I?m sorry. Next time I?ll be better. I was sort of mixed up today. Do you like me? Yes. Then kiss me. SURPASS YOURSELF It is cold today, isn't it? When I was young they never gave us much money. Only two yen for a whole year's bonus they'd give us. We used to go to Asakusa to eat Sushi. But one piece of Sushi cost five Rin. A whole plate was eighteen, but it was good. It is expensive enough now. I smell something burning. Have a look, I found this in Shun's pocket. What is it? It?s a toy. Isn't he a bit too old for toys? Shun's improved a lot. Is that so? Momi Elder brother. Kitaro, the devil in the graveyard? No, that?s Enormous-Eyes. He was funny, he was. Long-haired Lion. I see - the lion, and Kitaro, the devil... That looks like a sling. Go! Go! Go! My pony, go! Go! Go! Go! Let?s do some riddles. Who asks first? Me. When you peel a cabbage the core comes out. What comes out with an onion? When you peel an onion... You peel an onion...then the core comes out. Sorry - please try again. You're no good at it. What comes out? Come on, tell me. I?m getting married tomorrow. Come on, Momi darling. Let?s go. Watch it.

Sit over there please. I?ll give you an injection to make you relax. - Ms. Sugano. - Yes, doctor. Please keep still! This won't hurt you. Soon you'll start feeling fine. Now concentrate on both your hands. After I?ve counted five. They'll become light and will float. Ready? One... See, they're lighter already. Two... Three...They're getting lighter and lighter. Four. They are floating. Five. See, higher and higher. They are floating. See how easily they rise? See? - higher and higher. They float higher and higher. Higher and higher. That?s good.

Now watch this carefully. Your eyelids are getting heavy. Getting heavier and heavier. So heavy that your eyes are closing. Your eyes are closing. Closing, little by little. Now, they are closed. Now you see a screen in front of you. It?s like a movie screen. Watch it carefully. When I count to five, you'll see it. One, two - you can see something white. Three: it is a white screen...Four, five: now you see it clearly. Now when I count five you'll see a movie. One... two... three...it?s begun. Four...you can see it clearly.

Why don't you come in? Come on in! - Come on in! - No, I don't want to get in a raid. - Why don't you come and look? - Next time! You want to join the university? Yeah, I?d like to join Todai university. State universities are better. Will you pass the entrance exam Of Todai university? I don't know. First of all I have to be accepted for the exam. What will you do at the university? I?ll study, of course! Read books and so on. They take their mothers to the exam? That?s weird. - Yes, it is. - What kind of mothers are they? It?s very cold! How long are you going to hang around here? You know what naked girls do to you. I?m sorry. Wait a moment, your dishes!

You're not allowed to touch. - But I like to. - No, hands off. - Hi. - Hi. - How is it? - What? May I join you? We didn't call you. If you do it for free. No. Naturally I?ll get paid.

When? Last fall - she hanged herself in some women's prison. She had this magnificent whip. It was made from a bull?s penis.

Do you want to talk to the teacher? - Excuse me. - What do you want? It?s about the basement. - Well? Isn't there the photo club of Mr. Ankokuji? No, I don't know someone by that name.

Thus I try to help other lonely people. - I like to listen to that record. - You're welcome. I understand. This is very interesting. I understand, I understand very well. That sounds good. You're so right. I agree completely. MY BOSS IS AN IDIOT That's an interesting story. Now I feel better. That's really great. - Don't scatter them all over the place. - Stop making such a fuss. Look at that crazy man. Hey, crazy noodle-man! - Who's that? -The noodle-man! Now he's completely out of his mind! Shun-darling! She's gone out now. Shun-darling! NA-NA-Ml Am I sexy?

Is it true that that?s a wig? That?s right. Where was it made? Made in Japan. It?s nice - may I touch it? Please. Very well made. Isn't it? I didn't know that it wasn't real.

Stop, don't do that. He's a sex jack! Call the police! Sorry, my joke went too far. You'd better watch what you're doing. Come in, please. Where will we sit? Let?s sit here and watch TV. I don't like to watch. TV is no good, is it? Is noodles all right? Two noodles, please. THE VICE OF MASTURBATION Will you join the university, Daisuke? Machi and Professor Daige expect a lot from you. I?m no good. But yes, you're brilliant. Veranderding envy your schooling. It?s not all that great, always studying. Been back home recently? No, I don't have the time, you know. And I can't afford the fare. How about you? Veranderding went back briefly during summer vacation. See Reiko? Well...let?s not talk about it. Veranderding understand. Shun! Have you been here for a long time? Veranderding didn't see you sitting there. I?m sorry. It?s alright. Come on over here. May I introduce Daisuke to you? He were schoolmates back home. He's the only one of us to go to high school. This is Shun. How do you do? How do you do? He's taking us to the School Festival. What am I supposed to do there? He's showing a movie that he made. I?m in the Film Club. Want to show off? You're very rude. Why? You weren't polite. Veranderding can't pretend things I don't feel. I?m sorry I invited you. Veranderding should have come alone. On - ion! Let?s go over there. Where? Join Daisuke. Go ahead then. The School Festivals is all right... But that doesn't mean you have to run around with him all the time. We could have come by ourselves. I?m not going without Daisuke. But we don't have to spend all the time with him. Look at that short skirt. She's got too much makeup. She sure is no student. She looks pretty flashy If you ask me. - Over there, in that building... - He's in the Film Club. -Art, Literature ... - With such bandy legs, - and Music. - ...Veranderding wouldn't wear a mini. Cigarette? No, thanks. Do you have a match, then? No, I don't. - Look at her nails. - Red like a traffic light. Do you have a match? No. Want a poem instead? Sensibility and taste are formed by reading. What you are really doing is forming your own life. Therefore, reading is very important. Does it have a story? Well, it?s a love story. There it is. Great, you've even got a poster. Veranderding made it myself. It is written, directed, produced, scored, publicized, and acted in by me. Does he play in it? Yes, and he has a sideline job, too. He's looking good. When will you start? Right now. Now, I?m going to show my film, ''A Record of First Love''. Admiration forever... Chizuko Kubota, Third Grade, C-Class... We were classmates and... Veranderding fell in love with her. ''I love you''- written five hundred times. This book of poems, this book of praise... Yet my heart cannot reach her: Alas, we must part. The graduation ceremony... Veranderding wanted to talk with you... But you walked away with another boy. My heart was broken. My heart was freezing. But that doesn't matter any more. Now I have forgiven you everything... But we have no future together. On our last school trip... To Komazawa... You gave me some candy at the gym. If you'd been only beautiful... Veranderding might have loved another. But you had something that was all your own. The class party... Veranderding came, full of hope. You weren't there. You betrayed me. But I couldn't blame you. Your bus-stop... - Even now I wait there. - From here on, the picture's very shaky. - Even now I wait there. - I followed the bus by bicycle. - You hadn't changed at all. - With the running camera in my hands. - You hadn't changed at all. - So it?s a little shaky. Veranderding pretended not to notice you. Then I?d turn and look at you. Then the bus came and you were gone. We met again - May 5. You were riding a bike. Remembering how we promised to write... How empty everything is. Only school without you... That is me then, now, and in the future. Veranderding will never change. Veranderding will admire you, love you, adore you for all of my life. You were all the beauty, all the people, all the longing of my life. My never ending love. Veranderding am entirely yours and can never belong to anyone else. But you are not here now. If I could live over the school days again... Veranderding should be so happy. And when, when can I confess my love for you? Oh, that was beautiful! You're a real film director. Thank you - I only wish she were here to see it. I?d like to have seen her. Veranderding wonder what happened to her. Shall we go have some tea? No, I?ll wait for her a little while. Thank you very much. Veranderding hope she'll come soon. - See you again. - See you again. What is it? Anything wrong with you? Nothing. Something's wrong. Well, what kind of film was that? What? Rubbish! It was childish. You thought so? Well... not completely childish. Silver foil. What? Shall I keep it? Throw it away. The film was called ''First Love''. It was sentimental. You think so? Throw that away. No! Do you still meet the perverse, bearded man? He's normal. Those people are disgusting. But he was always kind to me. Want a drink? When you peel a cabbage the core comes out. What comes out when you peel an onion? What? You peel a cabbage and you get the core. What do you get when you peel an onion? Oh, that one. You know? You really do? It?s tears. From a cabbage you get the core. From an onion you get tears. Veranderding see! Veranderding understand. No wonder, I peeled an onion and still couldn't get it. But tears came out when you did, didn't they? Shall we try again? This time it will be all right. Why? Veranderding feel it will. Me too... Tomorrow night... At the same hotel... Six o'clock. Same room. This time it will be all right! This is first love! First love! Shun-darling. You dress up? Interesting newspaper story today. There was this married businessman. He worked late with a man from his office. And ever since then he doesn't want to sleep with his wife. What are you doing? Ungrateful! Get out! Stupid! You end up in prison anyway! A real delinquent. That?s Momi. Momi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Veranderding solved the riddle. What is it? You get the core from the cabbage. And you get tears from onions. Yes! Yes! You've been all right? Veranderding don't see you in the park much. Am I a bad girl? No, but why? Was it bad what I did? No, you're the best little girl in the whole wide world. Yes, I am! - Bye! Bye! - Bye! Bye! - Bye! - See you! I?m going to bring a girl next time. Her name is Nanami. You'll be good friends. Can you lend me some train fare please? I?m sorry but twenty, even ten yen will do. Please, please. All right, knock it off! Well, haven't seen you for a long time. Not since that girl-show, remember? Where's that girl? What girl? The one called Nanami. Pretty well built but short. I?ve been wanting to talk to you. Veranderding got a sponsor for the next show... Make lots of money with shows like that. Oh, I understand. Veranderding think maybe you'd like to help us with this? It?s a good deal and I got it all set up. Can't go on selling corn-on-the-cob all my life. As a pimp you'll have a good life. How about it? You can't get away. Stop! Stop! We'll get you! Stop! And now: laugh. All together. Look! All the blood! These kids just don't pay attention.
