No or I don't remember. But don't worry, I'll take him home, it's all right. He has the right to take transport alone? In fact, it's.., we're in the middle of a protocol, and he has to do several times the line for Do you know how crowded it is at this hour in the morning? Yes, I know that. - Sorry. We are confused. - He was not cooperative. Even at 4, it was complicated. He wanted to bite me. So there, that would surprise me a lot. Didn't you want to bite the gentleman? I am innocent. I know well. He's not the violent kind at all. Really not. Can I hit my mom? No He can't. he He likes to make this kind of joke. He's, He's doing it on purpose. to make me uncomfortable. Well, so goodbye, thank you. Let's go. Thank you, gentlemen. Just one more thing, He pulled the alarm at which station? On the bridge, before Kennedy Station. Thank you. Have a nice day. That's good.

No. I can put my head against your shoulder? Can I hit my mom? No, you can't! You don't hit your mother! Exactly. Is it the stripes? About what? Your socks! Come on, let's go. I pulled the alarm signal unintentionally. I'm aware of that. We're not far! Just before the station, on the bridge. You take a coffee ? No thanks, H?l?ne, I have appointments this morning. Come on ! A second. So really a second. -If you hit your mother you will no longer see Bruno- Lately he's watching old commercials on a loop, it calms him down. Otherwise, Bruno I made that pineapple cake you like. No, thank you very much. It's lovely. It's for you. No, but right now, H?l?ne, it's just too much. Well, if it's the pineapple one! Practical, economical and robust ! Well, thank you, H?l?ne. I really have to go. Take off your shoes. Xhy next ? That way we don't steal them. You won't have them after. You want to skate, I have the impression. You're ready ! I put my skates on and we go together. It's okay ? Mathieu, look at me. Cedric! Yes? Be careful. Never in front of the blade. There, he puts a blow on you, he plants you. Step aside. Let's get the skates on. Don't hit, Garance. We put them on? You're late. I've been struggling to find it.

Can you go get me a pair of 43 for Dylan? No no ! I didn't think we were going to skate! What did you think we would do here? Hoop? If you came to work, put on your skates, otherwise go home. Okay ? Come on! So, let's go! Everybody on the ice! He's been in our service for almost six months. He's been kicked out of half a dozen institutions. He was getting better, but yesterday he sent me a couple of medics on a ITT. The diagnosis ? Autism particularly severe. And the parents? Divorced. The mother, sick, is hospitalized, and the father is completely dumped. A pretty complicated situation. Good morning. Good morning. Valentin ? Good morning. My name is Bruno. Will you shake my hand? Valentin ? -Scream- Would you like to try to get up, go for a walk? I'm having trouble with the helmet. I know, it doesn't look like that, but in his case, it's a real progress. Valentine, when he hits himself, he's not faking it. In his last center, he was tied up. And even tied up, he mutilated himself. He has to move, even once a week. He needs to get out of here. It's urgent, or he'll regress. I will find a solution. I imagine. No! Mateo Laprade is a minor! He was in IME, so it's not the ARS taking charges We go through the ASE in this case. Hi, Menahem, how are you? Well ! I call the MDPH. They're going to send you all the documents and I'll get back to you. Ok thank you. Mr. Haroche, I wanted to introduce Ms. Diabat?, Ibrahim's mom who just arrived. How are you ? Fine. It went well ? Yes. We are delighted. See you after. Yes. Hi, Mendel. Hi, Bruno. Did it go well with Ibrahim? Yeah, it's okay, it was fine. Fabrice, can you come? I arrive Who's that? It's the inspectors. It's true, it's today! Yeah. You rock ? No problem. Well done. Hello ! Hello. It's the apple pie right there. How are you, Salimata? It's okay ? Not too much sugar! It will make us a good snack. Hello. Hello, Mendy. Hello, Bruno. Bruno ! Yes ? I got your message. I have no one. for your discharge from hospital. You're sure ? Yes, I spent 2 hours on it. Must see from the side of Malik. I call him. And for Joseph ? In the middle of the bridge. We're not far! That's what I told him. Mobile Hello? Mrs. Angela, hello. No. I told you I was going to find a solution. I will come back to you. What happened? Just a spot. Mr. Fratti is there. Your meeting. Now ? It's in the agenda. The synchronized calendar, it's for meetings. I know. You are logged in to your cell phone, you look and you know that you have meeting with Mr. Fratti. We still have to look at the calendar... It's okay. How is he ? In shape ? After 16 coffees, in my opinion, he is. I haven't waited an hour for you at all. A coffee ? I don't want to laugh, sit down. No, put it down and listen. The inspectors arrived this morning. Yes I know. We manage. What does "we manage" mean? It means "calm down". It's going to be as usual: 23 days and then goodbye. They're not the same! Albert, if you scream, I'm leaving. So we start out slow, please. They're not the same. There, it is not the ARS. You're a step up, old man. These are senior officials sent by the Ministry of Health. All right, am I calmer? Oui, quand tu parles doucement, calmement, d?tendu, oui ?a va. Great because I'm not, relaxed. Do you know the GISA ? The General Inspectorate of Social Affairs. "The mission must evaluate if the structure "can be regularized, "or if an alternative must be considered". The alternative You know it ? Translation: the alternative is shutdown. You're the target How long have I been telling you that you are hiring too much? Look ! We don't know how we're going to pay the charges. And you take too many kids, it's getting too big! We're going to burn our wings. With IGAS, I feel it bad. Listen, Bruno, it's not a threat, but if you want that I remain your accountant, I am asking you one thing. Stop saying "I will find a solution". Start there. What are you doing here ? Shouldn't you be in the music workshop? Okay, listen Ibou, come on. I'm fine, I manage Albert, the message got through, and we will find one Finally! A way of Finally, you understood me, what! Yeah. Come. This position is good. It's exactly that. Yeah, thanks. Exactly that. Nothing to say. He's really pro from pro over here. No, don't worry. That can do it. It's starting to look like something. You're giving me two laps, That'll teach you the schedule. Flexibility, style, elegance, I'm impressed. It's true? Really! For the deer jump, I'm practicing. So you found someone for my outing? I've got a kid in training. He needs to eat some ground. He could be fine. Where is he? Dylan ! Get over here! Come on! OK ! I will come. Yeah, I'm coming. Yeah, come on.

Come on, Valentine, You come with us ? Just ten minutes. We're going to pet the horses. You'll see, you will like it. We have all our time. We are well here in the great outdoors. We can stay there all afternoon. And when you are with the horses, you will no longer want to return. Valentin. Hey, Valentin. we ust go down. Hey! What's the matter with you? No, no, come down. Come down. You don't force it. You talk to him, Try to convince him, but you don't force him. The timing is what he give you, OK? We will be able to go there. Wait. Valentin, is that what would make you happy? A little bit of Coke? Come take it. Come. It is for you, come. That's it, come What do I do, it's getting late? 5 minutes please, 5 minutes. Now that we've had a good drink, are we going to see our friends the horses? Valentin, Valentin. Okay, guys, a little pony ride? How about it, Dylan? Seriously ? But no, not serious. Next time, if you're good. You can bring them in, thank you. Shhhhh. Thank you, hello. Hello. Shh, Valentin, calm down. Shh Calentin. Valentin, it's okay It's okay We come back to get you next week, allright? We'll go back to the horses with you, and if you want, this time, you can climb on it, ok?

Where are you at with the file? We explained to the social worker that the family finds dangerous that he's coming home. It'll be judicial placement. How long does that give us? Fifteen days. You will have a place? He's going to find a solution, huh? Yes. It is not incompatible with his treatment. OK. OK for the Spasfon. If he hits himself in the face, it could be the teeth. Brushing is complicated. Just keep an eye on it anyway, okay? Why is he outside? I take him back? I'm going. I'm coming. You come back after ? Yes. Hello. What are you doing here ? Who are you with here? An educator, a caregiver? You understand ? No. Well then me, it's Ludivine. I'm going to take it from you. You give ? Go ahead, give it. You can get it back afterwards. Come with me, I'll accompany you to the teen unit, come on. Well, Dylan ! What are you doing I've been looking for you for an hour. I went for a walk. It's. Sorry I got you I got you confused. He hasn't spoken. You haven't spoken! So I didn't understand. Sorry ! I am disturbing ? Yes, well no, you can stay. I Without breaking the love at first sight atmosphere can w go ?

We are full, we cannot accommodate one more kid is not possible. I thought we could try something Add a mattress. We're not going to push the walls. Tat's it Bruno. Yes. Can you come ? Yes, of course. I wanted to ask you, as we are already on the 24th, well, in the team, it starts to speak, to ask questions about salary Yes, there was a little delay but I'm going to check it all out. Okay, fine, thank you. And there is the screen of the TV to change: Victor tucked his head in. Yeah, I know, you're hungry, it's coming, don't worry. it's coming, eh. Oh dear I've been telling Bikash to come by for a week now. I know, but he's swamped on Petit Street. He has to change all the radiators Bruno ! Yes ? All right, I'll call him back, Bikash then... Yes ? There is someone for you. Yes Goodnight. Excuse me, I live just above, I moved in not long ago. Welcome. If you need No thanks. In fact, what I said to to your I mean, to the sir, there, is that it's been about 3 hours that it hits, like a regular hammer noise. It resonates with us, it's quite painful, so It's late, if we can avoid the works Of course. Excuse us, we will do what is necessary. Amina! Yes ! Go see Moussavir, please. OK. Ah! Menahem, how are you? Hi, Menahem. We need to talk about meals. Sorry. We need to talk about the menus. Good evening sir. Good evening. It is all good. Thank you, I said to your to the gentleman there that in fact it's very Do I put everything in the fridge? One second. Good evening. Hedi, I come from Malik. Hedi ? Yeah. Come visit. For the night watchman's job. I know. Hum I'm sorry, but it's okay, it's fixed. All right, then. In fact, it lasted 3 hours. No, but I understand. Hum Menahem ? YES ? If tomorrow you could arrive half an hour before, it would be great, because there, the kids were hungry, it was super hassle. We had a problem with the truck, but it?s going to work out if God wills. I hope he will quickly then, because we want to. We all want it, huh? Yes, yes. Thank you for taking the time to receive us. You must have sent the mail to a lot of people. 10,000! We sent the email to 10,000 business leaders. Did you get a lot of answers? We are not overwhelmed by the proposals, that's why I insisted. I?m not hiding from you that when I knew that I was going to meet you Joseph, in your field, he has a little talent. The talent, You know here, we repair washing machines. To be frank, I'm not sure that we are really adapted to to this kind of profile. M. Marchetti, Joseph, we've been with him for quite some time. For a kid like him, after 18 years, there's not much left. I have a simple proposition. Take it to the test. One week. No commitment No, but it's not bad will. He has enormous potential! There's the small errands. Well, that's good. small errands. Great, what is it? As we have a second workshop in Montreuil, we'd give him some material, he'd take the subway, there are four stations, he could go So yes, but it's worth it. first to test it in the workshop. His world, it's really the washing machines. Afterwards, for small errands, why not, we can try after. No, but he's self-sufficient? Can he take the subway by himself? Uh autonomous Sorry. Hello? Yes? Yes, no. No, we said no. We said we couldn't. We already talked about it. Several times. You don't hit your mother. That's it ! You are very kind, sir. Sorry. So uh Mr. Marchetti, so let's get started? Shall we try? A week to see. It's just a try. We totally agree ? Yes. Thank you. He will be happy! Yes We had an appointment at 6 p.m. It is 6:45 p.m. You haven't been brought up in a boarding house in England, but me either. When we're late, we apologize with a little conviction. We don't say, "Yeah, it's the traffic jams, it's the metro " Basically, if you're not happy, it's the same price. Here at "l'Escale", it's like a toolbox: you learn the rules, you train. I teach you how to do it, not know how to be. Mounir ? You're awake ? Yeah. Is that your medical certificate? Well yeah. That's what I'm going to show to your trainer to justify your absence on Tuesday's exam? Well, I was sick. Were you sick? You're a genius, Mounir! Not only did you tamper with it, but you spoiled yourself on the date. I didn't tamper with anything! So you're a medium or a soothsayer You already know that in 2 weeks, what are you going to have? Chronic stomach flu. Are you serious? So what happened to you? I did not wake up. Did not wake up It was 3p.m I stayed on the summer time. When you temper, do good. We know it by heart, your story. We know you're gonna telling us a bunch of tall tales, but we'd like to see that you've turned a corner. If not, a helpful reminder: The door, it's not far, I'm sure you'll find it. Now, your summary sheets. I need your expertise, and translate it into words. You're going to work in EMI, day hospitals, we need to make progress on this. I read stuff. "wat" for "what." "idk" for "I don't know." These are shortcuts. But that's not SMS messages you write! And stop with the verb bloody like "He bloody liked bowling, he bloody liked the skating rink." There are other words ! There are other times than the compound past. About that, I'm going to read you Dylan's report card, that's interesting. Be careful, it's going to go very fast. "Went well." "Went" write with "te" in the end I know you just arrived, but you do realize that you're gonna have to expand your vocabulary? In two words, can you elaborate a little bit? Bah It went well, that's it. Two words is an expression. You can allow yourself to go up to four or five. Or even in a fit of madness you take a subject, a verb, a complement, it can make a sentence. Where are you going? In two words, or should I give you a sentence? OOH ! He found it, the door! That's it. So, Joseph... I leave you here and I come back pick you up at the same place tonight. We agree. And where to go? At the tent for dancing. Exactly You look good in your tie there. It squeezes me too tight. Is it ? Mom told me, It makes me look good for work. That's right. I'll fix you up a little. Is that better? Yes. Good. So now you're gonna walk to the workshop, and then you're gonna ask to speak with sir? Marchetti. Perfect. Here, he'll explain the job to you. You do everything exactly as he says. Can I push all the buttons on the washing machines? Not all of them. Only the ones where Mr. Marchetti says you can. All right. And if anyone asks you how did you get here? By subway. Which station? Saint-Lazare. And ? Porte de Champerret. Yes ! Check ! Are we gonna tear it up? I'm going to tear it all up. I hope. Well, not everything anyway. I like it when you smile. Well. No more talking, let's get to work. Okay, come on. Come on. Don't run! Don't run Joseph's schooling has been, like, chaotic. No public school: his attacks frightened everyone. So we had to look for solutions. And did you find any? No. I mean, I did. I stopped working, it was the only way. Completely? Yes of course! Can you tell us what happened next? Then, there was adolescence. Joseph became more and more aggressive. He hit, he bit, he was throwing everything out the window. He communicated only beyond violence. My husband and I were lost. Completely lost. At that time, you've been looking for a place in an institution? Yes! But nobody wanted it. Except, there is... But that I'd rather forget. Yes, say it, it's important. He did a stint at "Horizon", at "Les Mureaux". And what happened? To control it, they were dosing him with medicine. "Risperdal" all the way. Him who can be so lively and smiling, he became He looked like a vegetable. As a matter of fact, my Joseph didn't fit in the boxes anymore. For us, it was nothingness. And then one day, my husband got the idea to send him on vacation. He said: "But he needs to get some air!" So he went around the agencies, he knocked on every door. Everyone refused. And then one night he said to me: "There's one who said yes." Bruno Haroche ? Right, that's it. He handled kids like that already? No, he was taking care of regular summer camps. But my husband explained our catastrophic situation, and go figure out why, Bruno said yes. Joseph went. 3 weeks in the mountains. It hasn't been easy every day... but he came home transformed. That's how Bruno created his association. So Joseph was the first, then? Right. That's why that Bruno and Joseph have a relationship How would I put it to you but unique! It was Bruno who created a protocol. When Joseph has violent episodes, he has to verbalize. Even today, when it goes up, he verbalizes. He often talks about me. He asks if he has the right to hit me. And then it goes down. Allright. Mrs Dubois, we understand the difficulties that you've had to face, but I need to clarify why we're here. We're in the middle of an inspection because this association, the "Voice of the Righteous", still does not benefit at this time of the day, an official authorization or approval. You understand that this is a problem. Yes, yes, that I understand, yes. But I'll tell you something. I often think about young parents when they discover their child's diagnosis. I wasn't told that we had to think long term. At first, we're in immediate combat. They're cute, little... We don't see them as adults, but over time The look in other people's eyes is no longer the same. For me, the world is divided in 2 categories. There are those who don't look at you anymore, and then the others. And there aren't many of them! So me, you know, the official authorization.. So it went well? It went well. Why did you keep your blouse on? I like it. As you wish. Today, I'm coming to get you. But not every day. We're gonna take the subway back. All right. You did everything he told you, right? Yes. Yes ? I want to stay there. Yeah. I like Brigitte. when she says goodbye to me. Brigitte? And who's Brigitte? Brigitte, she's super nice. Brigitte, that's good, but stay focused on the work. I'm going to stay. focused on the work. And on Brigitte. All right. Well, that's good. But tell me what you did at work. I pushed all the buttons. That's good. Brigitte, she laughed. Get in the van, we'll talk about it later. They're funny. If you shut down, they'll find themselves with 40 kids on their hands. We've had inspections, too. As soon as they get too close, they take a step back. It's not a regular inspection. They're special. It's like some kind of health police policy. I'm telling you, they've taken it up a level. You put kids in apartments at night, it's out of their control. That's the problem. That's the risk for them. Bruno, it's a crazy coincidence, but I have a friend of my sister's, she's passing through Paris and I was thinking that maybe she could join you. She's close by. And since she's single like you, I was thinking Menahem, no. That's sweet, Thank you, but now is not the right time. It's not a shidoukh. just like last time Call her. There, good idea! She's really close. You know me, I'm gonna do this in style. That's just it, I know you. Call her. Super. You're heavy, I don't have the head for it. Is a chidoukh a trap? No, it's like a date. It's introductions. A serious date or a date, uh. Are you out of your mind? Hah! She was quick! She was close! Of course. Good Miriam, I introduce you my friend Bruno. He comes here a lot. A very good customer, since he doesn't have a wife. And he's single Like you, huh? We've been trying for years But it's true that it's been a long time that he wasn't seen with a woman. Thank you for the presentation. Well, I'll leave you two alone. Let me know in advance for the engagement, given my schedule, while I get organized. Hum Malik I made you a coffee at the counter. I see what you mean. Are you from Strasbourg? She's from Strasbourg. I have a good feeling about this. Thanks, Menahem. Good evening. Good evening. I'm sorry. Sorry. Joseph ? No ? Yes. I'm confused, I'm sorry, sorry. Excuse me. No, you can't hit your mother. Sit down. No, Joseph. Nice to meet you. Malik. Myriam. My first chidoukh. I prefer to be honest with you. I prefer that we start on a good basis . Uh, Myriam, I'm a Muslim. Ah yes ? But a practicing Muslim. If practicing, it's all right. That's not all, in fact. I am married, 3 children. Practicing too? No! You can't, Joseph! You make me say that on the street. I'm busy. I'll go, your friend seems very busy. Uh, so for me, it's... Well, I'm going. Have a good night. I'm going. I'm sorry, I... No, you can't. No, you can't. There's traffic jams and We'll catch up, it's starting to get fluid now. All right, thanks. Sorry again. I'll see you in a minute, thank you. There's no answer at home either. What the fuck is he doing? He's fucking with me! Emilie's mother's calling me, what do I do? We are leaving. Wait, I think that's him right there. There was a problem in the train. Get in! 25 minutes, you put us 25 minutes in the view! Do you know what's going on with this 25 minutes? You're putting families in deep shit! Fathers, mothers waiting to go to work. And your boy is waiting for you at the hospital! Schedules are the basics, we talked about this! You're a caricature. We want to get you out of your clich?s, but we're going back in, just to show that we can't escape it. Half an hour in the face, That feels good! Don't yell! They've blocked the C-line for 20 minutes, what do I do? Stop with the lies. Metro, bus, train You think you're the first person who's ever told me shit? You're tiring me out! That's it, yeah, blow. Come on, play tough guy with me. Do you know who I am? What is that look? We'll talk. I told you, there won't be a third time. Where are you going? He found the door again. Hi, Alexis. Hi, Albert ! Sorry, we had a setback. That's okay. I put everything in his bag. Thank you. You okay, Alexis? Hi! Hi, big boy. We all say hi to Alexis. Hi, ALEXIS. Is he in good shape? No. Being late isn't helping. Sorry, again. I'll see you tonight. See you tonight, Malik. Here we go! Sorry for the late arrival. Pas de probl?me. Are you all right? Come on, let's go This is Valentin. He's going to spend the morning with us... we welcome him. He's not here. the one who takes care of him? Dylan ? He's on vacation. Ah, okay. Bye. Thank you, have a good day. Mounir, belt. Let's start warming up. We start to run, we do 3 laps. Come on. Come on. Face me again and we hop around a little bit. That's it, hopping. Wow, that's good!

Let him go, leave him alone. Hello, first. Hello, how are you? Let him go, you're three on him. He's harmless. This is ridiculous. Let him go! Keep your voice down and take a breath, sir. You're gonna give me a meditation class on the platform? Now, please, you leave him. That's enough! We're gonna write a ticket. Write a ticket if you want. You're doing your job, I'm doing mine. The amount will be 200 euros. Consider yourself lucky already, It can normally go up to 3,750 euros. We are happy, you cannot know. We're not far. Yeah. We'll frame it. Yeah, great. Have a good day. Thanks. So ? Somebody pulled the alarm unintentionally. I think it's always the same guy who does that. And who is it? You're gonna have to stop to pulled the alarm. Yes? I won't do it again.

That's better. will there be Brigitte? So Brigitte, no. Don't talk to me about Brigitte, that's out of the question. I'm not gonna pull the alarm anymore. We don't pull the alarm, you don't hit your mother, and we're not talking about Brigitte anymore. We're not far. Yes, we're not far. Well, shall we go? Come on. Be careful not to hurt yourself. That's it. Can I put my head against your shoulder? Yes, come on, quick. It's okay ? Come on I trust you, go on. (Don't run !) I'll call you back in ten minutes Thanks for Valentine, we'll get him back. OK. What happened with Joseph? Always his passion for the alarm signal. We're getting closer, but there's this bridge. He doesn't want to cross it. What about you? Did something break? All right, that's good. Yeah? How are you doing with our friends the officers? We're close to going away for the weekend together. Finally a big mess this morning: he blocked the C-line for half an hour. C-line ? Yeah ! Head forward, press your nose. I don't understand. What don't you understand? Two minutes before, Valentin shook my hand, almost hugged me and he breaks my nose. Most of these kids were locked up for a long time. Months, even years. We, when we get them back, that they find themselves in our midst, they're lost. They don't have the codes, they've been in isolation too long. All it takes is one frustration, some anxiety to get it out. Since they don't have the words, as you saw, it can be violent. Then I'll tell you this. I can only interpret. Because in reality, we don't know much. All we know is that at some point, we have to get them out of here. So? It's okay. ENT will take him in half an hour. We're still gonna get an X-ray. Are you coming? Mari?e, puis divorc?e. J'ai 2 petites filles. Noa, 8 years old Abiga?l, 5 years old. Who are also in Villeurbanne? Ah yes, they're with me. I really like divorced people. Ah ! It's I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I owe you an explanation. I'm very uncomfortable and that makes me say crazy things. "I really like divorced people." Doesn't mean anything. Well, I... Yes, it's true. I mean, it's... There's one thing I didn't ask So, tell me, please, it would be my pleasure. Eva told me to ask you to turn off your cell phone. Yeah. But I'm in airplane mode, so we can We can ? Can we get off the ground? Yeah ! Well, I... Like airplane mode I knew she wasn't the best joke of the century. There's someone here to see you. For me ? Yes. Yeah. What are you doing here? You're not picking up. No, I'm in.. We have a big emergency. street Anatole France with the new night watchman. We really need your help. Sorry. Well, so am I. I'm so sorry. I was kind of warned. I'm confused and I didn't introduce myself, I'm Fabrice, we work together. Now we have an emergency. That's why, otherwise... I'm sorry, really. Thank you! Sorry for both. Sorry Can I pay you, please? How did you find me? It's on the shared calendar. I didn't know what chidoukh was. Does it say chidoukh? Oh, boy. Talk about privacy! It's actually a date! I didn't know you guys did that. The others, they ask me if you're in date mode. We don't have to finish the discussion. No, we don't have to. Thanks. It's a jewish Tinder, actually. The keys. What is the form of your collaboration with Mr. Haroche and his Voice of the Righteous association? We operate in different structures, each to his own association, but they're complementary. We handle complex cases. We go one for one, in example 1 referent for 1 child. Us, at "l'Escale," we also do reintegration and training for young people in the hard districts. And Bruno recruits referrals from us. He needed a lot of people when he opened his apartments at night From June 2011, right? Basically, yeah. When you realized its structure had doubled in size in a year.., did you ever feel like at any point you know, you were encouraging someone who was taking inconsiderate risks? You're not gonna like my answer. Go ahead anyway. I thought he had balls. Ah. ?milie. ?milie, Come on. ?milie. Wait, ?milie. Can someone please give us a hand? Take it easy, take it easy. Where was I? You said Bruno Haroche had balls. Shall I elaborate? It will be fine, thank you. Can I tell you what I find inconsiderate? Go ahead. Which I find inconsiderate, is to leave the kids behind four walls, high on meds, tied up by their feet. I think that's really crazy. When you get them back after months of being locked up, it's complicated. Going through several reports, including those of the Regional Health Agency, it's the same result. Most of the supervisors don't have degrees. Are there any diplomas that prepare you getting slapped ? Where exactly are you going with this? Where am i going ? In some institutions, profiles are chosen. You swing, you can enter, but you're drooling, you're not coming in, I'm not telling you if he bites or hits. Aren't you going a little overboard? I'm not saying we're heroes or the best, but we don't choose anyone. I want, I don't want. I want the glass or don't I want the drink? Yes. The glass, yes or no? I don't get it. Well, he's thirsty. Wait, he's the one who has to tell me, not you. Valentin ? You want You want a drink. I'll serve you. Here. Drink You don't want to? We hit. I don't understand anymore Can you come, please? Yes, i'm coming Hold on. Can you stay with him? I'm coming , Valentin. (Yes ?) Are you ok, Valentin ? You want? So ? Thank you Oh, well? Bravo! That's good! See, you were thirsty. We had a good session! Come on, you can go. See you soon ! Goodbye. Bye. Bye. Stop, stop, stop. stop What did I tell you ? Stop with that. Joseph ! Thanks, leave it there. It suits you, the blouse. Can you bring me the other box? Hum Brigitte hum Brigitte I'll need the other box now. Nice Brigitte. (Mr. Marchetti. He do it again.) Joseph, Joseph come. Come. You need to leave her alone, okay ? He's bewitched! I receive a spell during my pregnancy. I saw a specialist He confirmed it to me. Specialists, there are all kinds. Yes Excuse me. Mama, We have to go, Ibou is getting agitated. One minute, I'm coming. He's bewitched, you don't want to understand. I'm working day and night to get him into the country, and we're gonna get him out of this spell. I'm telling you. I repeat, that Ibrahim is making progress, that now he's eating well, that he understands Thank you. for what you did for Ibrahim, but I've made up my mind, I'm taking him home with me. That's too bad, Mrs. Diabat?. Mrs. Diabat?, for Ibrahim I'll bring him with me. You should think about it. Thank you for all you've done. Mrs. Diabat?, you're gonna... He'll go with me! Mom, it's okay. It's my son. Excuse her, I'm so sorry, she's kind of on a loop with it. You know, we all have our beliefs, we're looking for explanations and we hang on to what we can. You're what we're hanging on to. I see how Ibou is evolving. We wanted to tell you with my brothers and sisters. I'm happy to hear from you, because with your mom.., apart from the crises, I have no comeback... about what's going on at home. Well, I'm available if you want talk longer on occasion.

We work with organizations Not organisms, calendar that synchronize in the cloud. I mean, it's not Well, I'm going to join my mother. Of course!

He goes to the M.U.H.I.T.E.A a lot. He's got a crush on a girl there. The orthopedist. Malik said it. Hey, first of all, I didn't say anything, and when I said it, I said the speech therapist! The orthopedist, he's the foot doctor. Wait, there's a doctor for the feet? It's okay, it happens, Mounir. But, don't talk, new piquette for you, l'Escale en force! Hey hey hey ! Until evidence to the contrary, Dylan, he works for me. Contractually, he's still with us. That's the contract, I'm bringing it to you. Dylan, t'en penses quoi ? Me, I don't know. You're serious? What do you mean you don't know? You do have a slight preference. Dylan, family, ho! No, the family of what? The family. Dylan! Dylan, hey, blood, blood brother! You can define us the exact role of the MUHITEA? And you can specify the function of this unit? We welcome the most severe cases of the entire Ile-de-France. Those that institutions and hospitals can't handle anymore. Here, the patients are hospitalized, because they can put in danger their families or staff. How long are they staying children and adolescents admitted to your services? We're taking them for a period of time theoreticaly for 3 months. We don't have a vocation to keep them too long. Some respondents as part of our inspection talk about selection on behalf of the institutions regarding these complex cases. What's your opinion on this? In a context of saturation, it's a reality. There is an avoidance phenomenon of the most difficult situations. I guess that's how you explain the sustainability of "the Voice of the Righteous" who's been living for 15 years without a official license? Yes, partly. It's very paradoxical, autism. The more you are considered as a complex case, and the longer you stay locked up at home. with no support. You still sent there regularly several of your patients With what guarantee on medication management, on the quality of those who administer them, about security, supervision, hygiene? This association responds to needs in emergency situations. Unconditionally, she accepts of the patients that society represses, or that seem impossible to improve. You understand that if we let it exist this association out of any frame, What guarantees that less conscientious, wouldn't proliferate? Nothing. In all these years, you didn't try to talk them out of it, to reason with them? In medicine, we have protocols. They're the opposite of that. They are worn by their hearts, by their faith, and therefore, they're innovating, they're breaking new ground. Yeah, at one point, they were told "be careful." "It's too risky, don't go.". But they didn't listen to us. And you know what? I think they were right. Of course, you can count on me. Goodbye, now. Goodbye, now. Are we texting? All right. Ho, Valentin ! Stop, stop, stop Don't touch that, no. How did you find her? Who? My friend the other night. Ah, from Strasbourg? No, from Villeurbanne. Well, very good, Villeurbanne. Well, I left a little fast. I'm gonna call and apologize and invite her for a coffee. Will you help me? No, you don't have to. She didn't like me. She really liked you, but she met someone. Is it serious? They're getting engaged. This is serious. You can't miss it. No. There are still shelves to finish. Otherwise, I have a friend from Aix-les-Bains, she's coming if you want. No, listen. That's sweet, Eva, but right now... The chidoukhs are going to be fine now. Arcachon, Biarritz, Nantes. It's the Travel's Guide of Chidoukhs! Besides, it's not my thing, it's too mechanical. All those women dressed in black, long-skirted Me, basically, I like bright colors. Non, on dit pas ?a. Excusezle lui aussi. Uh, no. Am I interrupting? No, we were almost done. Was it good? Please, Malik. Oh, stop that! I brought you this. Good. Have you thought about the window? Uh, yeah. How do I do it? Look at this, all broken. But stop yelling like that, he didn't mean to do it. Is that right? I saw him. He touched all the cr?me br?l?es. Easy, I don't know, you're talking for nothing, he didn't mean to do it. You're not ok. Get out, you! Get out! What do you mean, get out? I don't like you! You think I'm your kid? Don't touch me! What don't touch you? Get out of the way! Are you crazy or what? How you say get out ? Dylan, you're going down. Relax. Come, come, come here. What's going on? The kid, he touched on the creme brulee. How do I do it? All right. Shall I burn them? Look at this, look at this! I got it. It's a kid with difficulty. Forgive him He said fuck me, that's not what we say. No that's not what we say. Forgive him too. That's not what we say. Mister, we gonna pay for all of that. That's not correct. We gonna pay What's happenning here ? It's all right. It was just a little misunderstanding but it's all fixed. No problem. No problem. No problem? Then let's go back. Of course. There are customers. Go up to the room. Room 808. "Valentin enjoyed enormously "has enormously" I don't care, let's just say "bloody." Is that good or bad? That's better, isn't it? "Valentine bloody loved cr?me br?l?e." I'm putting this on, I don't care. Can I talk to you for a minute? Yes, of course Joseph, you will wait for me In the van, I'm coming. What's going on? I have a lot of comments from my staff. And especially from an employee. He must have told you about. No, I don't know. What's her name? Brigitte Monier. Brigitte. Ah yes, he likes her, right? It's more than that, he as an obsession This morning, she asked me to change her schedule. All right, I'll talk to Joseph. We have to give him some time. Except for that one little problem, are you happy with him? With work, it's perfect. But Brigitte Monier, it's no small matter. She's very embarrassed. He's always asking her to put his head on her shoulder, several times to see her socks. Yes, but that's affection. Words don't always have the same meaning, with Joseph. When you know him We're in a company. There are rules. There are things that we can't admit. Besides, I have other problems. I understand that, but... I told you that at the end of a week, we will discuss it. That's what we're doing, right? It's complicated. Fortunately, we've been avoiding the small errands. Fortunately. I would have tried. Yeah, that's pretty good. What's that supposed to mean? Why a strawberry? Valentine, look. You know, you? Is that good or bad? Trampoline. Hey, Menahem. Hey Dylan. Hello, Hello.Hello. You're on time i'm starving. What is it tonight ? Chicken, potato. And isn't there the pastry from the other time? Hallots ? Still below. Don't worry. Ah, great ! Come on, we're out of here because Friday it's the race. Shabbat shalom. You too. Yes, to wash 4 kilos of laundry with only 12 liters of hot water, you of course need a Philips automatic washing machine. Automatic, Philips. It has the smallest size which is, like, 40 centimeters. A few very simple gestures, and it works for you. Automatic Listen, listen, he seems to have calmed down, I... I'm gonna take this opportunity to go now. You haven't even touched the cake. No, but... I love this cake, Helen, but... Some other time, okay? makes it impossible any bad move. Shall I wrap it up for you? No, don't bother. It don't bother me. It's all right, Helen. It's gonna be all right. We're gonna make it. It's not far now. All that work's gonna pay off eventually. You have to hold just a little longer, huh? And what will he be when I'll be gone? I can't stand that he ends up locked up. I'd rather fuck myself up with him right now. Then I'd rather taste the cake. Huh? Besides, he's the pineapple one, right? Huh? Valentin! Fuck Valentin! Fuck Fuck Fuck, shit! Valentin! You've reached the voicemail of Bruno Haroche, leave a message and I'll call you back, thank you. Valentin! Valentin! Valentin! Malik, it's Dylan. You have to come. We're covering all the streets, parks, streetcars, the subway gate, any place where there's heat. We don't go to bed until we find him. Fabrice did you call Bruno? it's friday night.. Find a way, warn him. Let's warn the others, come on, let's go. Fuck We're on Petit Street now. Ok, We're going back up Boulevard Jean Jaur?s. We cut by Secr?tan. So far, nothing. All right. Sadio, call Cedric. Meet him in 10 minutes at Stalingrad. OKAY. Any word from Mounir? No. HornVasy, move! You haven't seen a little boy like this, with a helmet on? No, I don't think so. But give me your number if I see something I call you What?! Fuck ! Malik ! He is walking on the ringroad between Pantin's gate and Lila's gate Hurry up ! Ok, we're coming Valentin ! Valentin ! Valentin ! Brake ! Come on ! Take him ! Let's go ! quick quick quick ! Why my ID? Just for verification. I'm working. This can't be happening. to do this, sir. You look okay. and smart I left home without any papers. He's gonna come with us. We gonna check this Well, hey, I'll pass. to see you anyway. I'll call you. I fucked up. Elaborate! I fucked up, I said. Anyway ! That's it for me, I'm done. Let me ask you a question. You know why you came to L'Escale? Look me in the eye when I'm talking to you! I'll tell you why. You came because you don't exist! When I met you You held the walls of your district. We're giving you a gift by giving you these kids. Thanks to this, you're making a place for yourself. One place that no one else will offer you. But at some point, you have to take your fucking chance. And this is happening between you and yourself. That's what being a good person is all about, no one can do it for you. Think about that. Come on, let's go! By letter dated 20 February 2017, executive directors of the Minister of Social Affairs and health and the Secretary of State for people with disabilities, have seized the IGAS, ourselves, of a mission concerning the structures managed by your association, taking over, without authorization, in accommodation or day care, children and adults with disabilities with severe autism disorder. This mission follows to some inspections by the ARS, which has found that the existence of reception conditions abusers, notably on the Paris sites, due to unsuitable premises, of unqualified workers, and the absence of any service project. I already know that, but Can I talk? Are you done? Not yet. We'd like to hear from you about Valentin Fournier's runaway. that you left alone in a hotel with an unqualified educator, and who miraculously pulled through. So we have some questions. You'll have to be patient, Mr. Haroche. That's good because today, I'm happy. You know why? No but you're going to tell us. Because I've been waiting for you. It's even been a long time! Cause I also have a few questions. For example, you can tell me why, if we're unprofessional, as your reports say, why for the last 15 years, ARS, Child Welfare, judges, hospitals call me every day to see if we can accommodate other children? Why do I have 40 under my responsibility, day and night and more than 50 on the waiting list as we speak right now. Why do we keep coming back knocking on our door? Listen. No, why ? My question is, why? I get it, let's try to stay calm. We understand your feelings. We understand the difficulty, of the suffering of families and children, but we can't let it spread Let's save time. All of it, it's all about the money. Nobody wants to pay for those heavy cases. Why are we getting them back? Because nobody wants them. If it suits you to believe there's a white knight on one side, and on the other, a cold administration, out of touch with reality, know that things are more nuanced and complex. You've taken initiatives asking questions. We have to charge to return to a situation that gives more security, more guarantees. You're right. You're right, let's stay polite, calm and rational. Anyway, I had some time to think about all this and I believe that I have a solution. Let's hear it. Go ahead. Take them. Really, take them. But then take them all! Mateo Laprade, aggressive, is banging his head all the time. Even with the medicine, he hits. He sleeps 1 or 2 hours a night. No accredited institution wanted him: 11 refusals. His mother was told: "Come back in ten years, "when we have a suitable structure." Take him. Idriss Diop, epileptic, affected of severe autistic disorder. Impossible to contain unless with 3 person. You'll end up strapping him, sedate him and lock him up. Take him too, Idriss. Moussavir Leguen. 5 months to get him back on his feet. He likes to catch, scratch everything that comes along, arms, hands, hair. Last week, he scalped a teacher! Mr. Haroche C?cile Laporte, take her! Kevin Loiseau, take him, Luka Bovin, take him! Valentin Fournier, Julie, Ibrahim, Aisha, Frederick! Take them! Take them all! But then frankly Frankly I wish you good luck. Over the years. Some associations have managed to occupy a very special place in the fields of mental health, disability and child protection... Hey, J?r?mie. Hello. Hello. See you tonight. Hey J?r?mie ! Are you all right? We're gonna have a good day. Let's go. My name is Bruno. For a long time, no public actor wished to raise the issue fearing a shutdown that would expose many fragile children to dramatic disruptions in their care... No, no ! No, no ! Hop ! Ouh ! Lo?c, Lo?c, take, hop ! Are you ready ? You want to play a little, he? We'll make her play with us. What ? It's growing ? No no no, not that. No That's okay.

There's a tradition here: when a kid gets his diploma, we make noise! Shutting down a structure which is the only one to ensure the support of child psychiatric hospitalization, without an immediate alternative solution does not seem possible... ... The delegation recommends: a provisional authorisation of an exceptional nature... Extract from the report of the General Inspectorate of Social Affairs. 17 april 2017 (Come with me. Come on.)
