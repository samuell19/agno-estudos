"The victor will never be asked if he told truth" Adolf Hitler Since the mid-20th century, the world has ever heard of an incredible story, the story of a boy from an ordinary family whose ambition it was to became an artist, but who instead became a drifter. His destiny however was not to drift into the awaiting oblivion, but to rise to the greaest heights of power, eventually to become one of the most influential men who ever lived. Now for the first time, here is the true and fctual account of a story many believe to be... The Greatest Story NEVER Told! The Untold Story of Adolf Hitler ADOLF HITLER THE GREATEST STORY NEVER TOLD! April 20, 1889 Braunau am Inn, Austria The story began here in the Austrian town of Braunau, with a child born in this house, Adolf Hitler. At his peak, the most popular ruler in Europe. The child born here in Braunau, belonged to that handful of human beings, who have clearly and decisively changed the history of the 20th century. Linz, Austria, the site of the only memorial to the Hitler family. The grave of Hitler's parents. Nothing about his parents or Adolf's early life, gave any hint of the extra ordinary career that was to come. His father Alois was a stern short tempered custom's official who beat his son. His mother Klara tried to protect him. When she died young Adolf was broken by grief. He kept her portrait with him for the rest of his life. The infant Adolf was baptized and brought up as a Catholic. At the age of 6 he entered the monastery school at Lambach. Soon he was top of his class. Hitler was a chorister at the Great Abby Church of Lumbach. I used he said, "to intoxicate myself with the solemn splendor of the services." Every day when he sang in the choir, he saw the memorial to an earlier abbot. Above it was an emblem, which a quarter of a century later, Hitler was to adopt for the Nazi Party, the Swastika. In his teens Hitler became a moody adolescent. At secondary school in Linz, he lost interest in most of his work. His ambition was to go to Vienna and become an Artist or Architect. Once there he produced architectural drawings and water colors like these. Competent, but not good enough to win the place he longed for at the Viennese Academy Of Fine Arts. Vienna, Austria Little by little all Hitlers early ambitions in Vienna turned sour. After the shock of being turned down twice by the Academy of Fine Arts, he became a drifter. Hitler later called his period in Vienna the most miserable time of my life. Vienna 1913 Three of those miserable years, were spent here in a Viennese back street at this hostile for homeless men. In this depressing hostile, the future Führer passed much of the day sitting with other inmates churning out drawings of water colors which earned him a modest income. When he drifted from Vienna to Germany in 1913, he was still dreaming of becoming a great Artist or famous Architect. Munich, the first of August 1914. A cheering crowd welcomes the outbreak of the First World War. On the right is a photographer, and among the crowd he's photographing, is the 25 year old Adolf Hitler. Adolf Hitler - THE WAR HERO If you look at the tenacity of his service, I mean he's a fanatic. And he petitioned King Ludwig III of Bavaria, to enlist in what is referred to as the King's own regiment. That's an elite Bavarian unit. He was accepted, but put in the 16th Bavarian reserve infantry. And World War One is a major influence on Hitler's life. Now he served his basic training without complaining. But he was always willing to offer his fellow comrades help. He spoke about the evil of tobacco and alcohol to his fellow soldiers, and they liked him because of his drawings that he did for them. He would do sketches for them. Remember he sketched and did a variety of things you know in his youth, as he was trying to get into Art school. So he really got along with his fellow soldiers. At one point during the trench duties, in between 1914- 1918, he will have a dog, somebody going to steal from him. During World War One Adolf Hitler repeatedly, repeatedly volunteered for hazardous duty. His first combat was October the 29th, 1914. Hitler's unit lost 3.000 of its 3.600 men, after making 5 assaults on the enemy position. Now Hitler had one of his sleeves shot off. He walked out of a tent where he'd been talking with some men, and a couple of seconds later a shell hits and blows it to kingdom come. And for his fighting in this unit, he was awarded the Iron Cross, 2nd Class for Bravery, Bravery Under Fire. And he was promoted to Corporal. So this is a well deserved award. Later, he became a runner, which meant he moved messages from the rear to the front, and it's a very high mortality job. And he liked it, he always liked that job. Then in December, of 1914, when you have the famous Christmas truce, on December the 25th, Hitler wouldn't leave his trench. And his comment was, "such a thing should not happen in War time". Then he told his buddies that participated, that they were wrong to get involved. So no fun, while the war goes on, those are your enemies. Now between 1914- 1916, in the final stages of the Battle Of The Somme, Adolf Hitler was wounded in the leg by a shell fragment. This sent him back to Germany to recover. And he's there for about 5 months. Hitler could have stayed back in Germany, on light duty because of his wound, but demanded to be sent back to the front. So this... he's no shirker. You've got to give the guy some due here for not being a chicken. A lot of people, you know, look for a way to get out of there. Then you have Hitler back again on trench duty, and then he shows up again during the of course German offensives. Now, during the Ludendorff offensives, he was armed with a pistol and he captured five French soldiers. And for that he received the Iron Cross 1st Class. You didn't get those at any time in the war for free. You can't dismiss his decorations. He wins the Iron Cross 2nd Class in 1914, 1st Class in 1918, and then in mid October he got another battle field decoration. But he's never promoted because he had a Captain, Captain Fritz Wiedemann, said he lacked the capacity for leadership. You just can't make these statements. As the war turned against Germany, he believed that the pacifists and the shirkers, which were people trying to get out of duty, were losing the war. And the thing that enraged him even worse is what is referred to as "defeatism" in the ranks. They're actually non-commissioned officers, who said it was stupid to keep fighting. He beat one up. So we have a Corporal beating up a non-commissioned officer, and he doesn't get into trouble for it. He's a fanatic. The end of the war Hitler was gassed by the British forces advancing their Ypres in mid October 1918. It bloated his face up, in particular his eyelids. Constantly watering eyes, had a hoarse voice. He then had this terrible pain, he referred to it "piercing pain in my eye socket". He hated leaving the front to go to the hospital. He considered it the happiest chapter in his life. Being there, being something, being with people, you know he had friends, and he had comrades while he was in the war. He was not a loner. He had the respect of his fellow soldiers. He had purpose. By early November Hitler's spirits had come back, and it's very common for people who had been gassed to plunge into depression, because they're concerned about being blind the rest of their lives. On November the 9th, this is two days before the Armistice, a local Pastor came to the hospital and told the patients that on November the 8th, that the Kaiser had abdicated, and Germany was now a Republic. And he told them that the war was lost. Defeat was followed by a humiliating peace at Versailles. The injustice of Versailles rankled with most Germans for the next 20 years. Unable to accept that the German army had lost the war, Hitler convinced himself that the soldiers had been stabbed in the back by Communist revolutionaries and parliamentary Politicians. The stab in the back he believed was part of a great Jewish conspiracy. Suddenly Hitler discovered the greatest talent he possessed, the gift of public speaking. He joined the small group of fanatical Nationalists in Munich. They became the National Socialist German Workers Party, or Nazis. In 1921, Hitler became their leader. Munich 1921 The word "Nazi" was used by the Allies as a derogaory term, popularised by the international media for propaganda purposes. After World War One, Germany was in serious danger of a Communist takeover, with 6 million German Communist Party members in the country. Adolf Hitler was only the 55th member of the NSDAP, and although membership rapidly grew under his leadership, the early meetings were often held under threats of violence. Vastly outnumbered, the National Sociolist would often find their meetings infiltrated, where brawls would inevitably break out. The first film of the apprentice Führer campaigning shows him as still a rather awkward figure. Not yet certain of his roll as Germany's Messiah. In 1923, Hitler felt strong enough to try and seize power in Munich. Emil Klein, the only stormtrooper still alive who marched with Hitler, now retraces their steps. Everything went well until the marchers found armed Police blocking their exit from a narrow street. "We were still singing as we marched down the street. Suddenly, we heard shots being fired all around us. Procession started. We were speechless, we couldn't explain what had happened, until word came from the front of the march saying Hitler was dead. I saw men with tears in their eyes, and I myself was very moved to, and had great difficulty keeping myself under control. Though Hitler in fact survived the hail of bullets, he was arrested and locked in a cell in Landsberg prison. At first he was so depressed, he refused to eat. Then his confidence returned, as he discovered that the failed uprising had made him a local hero. At the trial Hitler rounded on his accusers. He told the Judges, who gave him a prison sentence, "history will tear to tatters the verdict of this court!" You have been accused of 'High Treason' and called 'An Enemy Of The State'! "If I am guilty of anything, then I am guilty of fighting to defend the rights to the German people." Herr Hitler, the court finds you Guilty of Treason. You are hereby sentenced to a fine of 200 Gold Marks, and 5 years in Landsberg prison. You will... you will be eligible for parole in 9 months. Adolf Hitler will serve next 12 moths in Landsberg prison To be continued Part 2 Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told! After the propaganda triumph at his trial, Hitler set out to write the Bible of National Socialism. He dictated much of the text here in his cell to his faithful follower, Rudolph Hoess. On Saturday evenings, the other prisoners sat around as Hitler read out the completed chapters to them. The book as a whole, dwells on the great obsessions which had come to dominate Hitler's political thought; the Jews, racism, living space for the German people, the evils of communism and parliamentary democracy. But it also includes Hitler's views on a variety of other topics ranging from boxing to syphilis. Mein kampf Mein Kampf will become one of the best-selling books of al time, despite being banned in many countriesfter the war. The amasing apeal, Hitler was lated to exercise but he is mastering a spoken word. After prison, the Leader, or Führer as he now called himself, had a new political strategy. Instead of planning another coup, he aimed to win power at the polls. What was to win him millions of votes, was instead, his vision of a great national revival. Hitler's election opportunity came with the onset of the depression. In a few years, 1 in 3 of the labor force was out of work. Ilsa Vemple, was a church social worker during the depression among the unemployed in the Berlin slums. "The despair was so terrible as I can't describe it. You had everywhere beggars, wherever you went in Berlin, you had beggars." The democratic political parties offered no solution. To millions of Germans, the only hope was Adolf Hitler. Have you been to the marketplace? Do you know how much it costs for a loaf of bread these days? $500.000 marks. $500.000 marks! The wheelbarrows aren't big enough to carry the money in! He's afraid I'll stir things up. You tell Commissar Kahr, this is not a time for silence. "I supported Hitler because he, after having seen all that depravity, all that poverty here, was the only one who could do social justice to the people here." "He had that ability, the ability derived from his readiness to throw himself totally open to... to appear as it were, bare and naked before his audience, to tear open his heart and display it, to throw on a few extra generators and suddenly become absolutely charged with energy." Presidential Elections 26 April 1925 Nur Paul von Hindenburg Reichstag, Berlin Nazi Party: 3 seats April 1925 Election Campaign It wasn't as though he was using words, it's as though the emotions came direct without words almost. There was a rawness about Hitler's power. Reichstag Election Nazi Party: 107 seats Six and a half Million votes. 107 seats. The biggest party in the Reichstag. Get me Hitler. Reich Chancellary, Berlin 30 September 1933 Nobody has ever had this power to move audiences so easily. What he says... it's the way he says it! Hitler comes to power, not as he had hoped through outright victory at the polls, but as head of a coalition government. As this withering glance suggests, Hitler despises his coalition partners. He quickly out maneuvers them, and establishes his own dictatorship. A month after he comes to power, the Reichstag building, the parliament building, in Berlin is set on fire. This happens to come The Reichstag Fire 1933 at the time when he is constantly insisting that there is a communist plot to overthrow the new government, and to scary out a revolution. And the Reichstag fire goes up in flames which everybody can see. Before that night was over, he had got a set of decrees drawn up, which transformed the situation politically. All the guarantees, in which people in any democratic state, the freedom of speech and so on, freedom from arrest, all of this is swept away. In the 1920s, Berlin was known as the center of sexual perversion, drugs and depravity. Once in power Hitler ordered the sity ceansed of these elements. Obscene books, pornography and Communist literature were all burned by the National Socialist. The clampdown will fore Jews, promiscuous liberals and gays such as Marlene Dietrich - a known bisexual - to leave for the US. 1933 BERLIN The burning of pornography and Communist literature A majority of Germans tolerate the burning of books, the banning of other political parties, and the setting up of a police state, because Hitler offers a way out of the depression. If he's doing things which are not so good, which happened, then we said, "well, you have to take the rough with the smooth." Dictatorship seemed to be the only way to get out of the mess, and so, I thought that was a good thing that they cut away all this nonsense and rather did something, really did something, and that's what Hitler did. He eliminated the crushing unemployment that Germany suffered. And he gave millions of people new confidence, and indeed, welfare. They were doing better; much better. When Hitler assumed power in 1933, there were 7 million unemployed Germans, the highest per capita unemployment rate in Europe, at the time. In only is first year in office, an unprecedented 3.374.000 were helped back to work. Hitler's brilliant and innovative ideas included building motorways the lenght and breadth of the country, with housing units provided for workers. The worker's familes would then eagerly spend the newly earned wages, contributing to a fast-growing economy. Priority was given to the health and fitness of the nation, especialy for the youth. Free healthcare and generous financial support were provided for expectant mothers. The world's first anti-smoking campaigns are also introduced. In addition, it was now government policy to protect the environment and wildlife. Crime was virtually eliminated, with city streets made safe to walk again. Workers, subsidised by the government, would take holidays abroad. Hitler is the first in Europe to introduce the 40-hour work week, with extra pay for overtime. Factories are now required to provide workers with restrooms and a cafeteria. The NSDAP leadership looked upon the charging of interest on loans as immoral, and by forsing banks to abolish the practice of usury, millions were freed from slavery of debt. It was a spectacular financial recovery not witnessed before or since, and often reffered to as the greatest economic miracle of all time. Meanwhile, most Western countries were still mired in the Great Depression. THE NUREMBERG RALLIES The annual celebration of Nacional Socialism They came in the tens of thousands, full of youthful idealism to worship the Führer, the awesome surroundings of the Nuremberg stadium. Among the worshipers in the Hitler Youth was Alfons Heck, now a writer of the Nazi period. The decisive turning point in my life occurred at the age of ten. From that moment on, I would remain beholden to Adolf Hitler, long until after our defeat. I was one of 82.000 members of the Hitler Youth lined up in Zeppelin's Field. I stood in the first row. And when Hitler began to speak, we were just tingling with nervousness, filing to see our God. Then he appeared on the podium. I was afraid to look at my neighbor, because I didn't want him to see the tears in my eyes, my knees were shaking. Then Hitler beamed down on us, he calmed us down by lifting his hands, both hands several times. When he began to speak it was in a very conversational tone, man to boy, father to son. Then he said how fortunate we were to live in this new age. And he said from now on you, no longer have to fear any class distinction, you're all one. But the essence, and the emphasis occurred in the final sentences. He leaned over the podium, and I know he looked straight into my eyes. And he said, "You, my boys, the young of Germany, live in a fortunate time, because you are the standard bearers of the movement. You will inherit what we have so far created." And from that moment on, without any doubt, I was bound to Adolf Hitler. Long until after our defeat. Before us lies Germany within us Germany is stirring behind us all Germany is following! The mid 1930s were the halcyon years of Hitler's Germany. Germany was at peace, her prosperity restored, her national pride recovered. To those prepared to ignore or justify, the police state, it seemed a beautiful Germany. A host of distinguished foreign visitors, many with impeccable democratic credentials, came to call on the Führer at his mountain retreat, the Berghof. Among them, was the former British Prime Minister, David Lloyd George. With LG, was his secretary Albert Sylvester. BERCHTESGADEN 4t SEPTEMBER 1936 Hitler run down the flight of stairs to welcome LG as he got out of his car. Shook hands with him most warmly, and conducted us into the inside of the Berghof. This massive room, the only light of which came from a massive window, which was terrific, I'd never seen such a window. Lloyd George said, "You have done great things for Germany. You have restored her honor, and you have gained for her equal rights." To be continued Part 3 Adolf Hitler - The Greatest Story NEVER Told I've met a few. Arm chair Politicians. Care more about their money, than they do their own country. Yes, but surely as your Parties propaganda leader, you must know, that in order to defend their money they'll spend it. A good deal of it. That is if someone they trust tells them that it is a safe bet. That's where I come in. Herr Hitler, I can make you very popular. Far more popular than him. But you have to admit, the color catches the eye. Unlike the Soviets with their hammer and sickle, the Nacional Socialist had no such flag or amblem. Hitler not only wanted a simbol to represent the NSDPA, but one powerful enough to strikefear into the Communists. The once failed art student would now set about to design the most recognised flag in history. After 1945, the NSDAP flag will be banned and portrayed by the media as a symbol of hate. It also be hijacked by extreme political group, and others such as motocycle gangs, who have no concept of its oriinal anti-Communist design. THE BLUTFAHNE SWASTIKA The Blutfahne displayed at the attempted Beer Hall Putsch in Munich in 1923 ended up covered in the blood of National Socialist members either wounded or killed by munich police. It was thereafter treated as a sacred object, used at the Nuremberg Rallies by Adolf Hitler to "sanctify" new flags. This most treasured of all NSDAP artefacts was last seen on 18 October 1944. To this day its whereabouts remain unkown. On the morning of the 12th of March 1938, German soldiers crossed the border into neighboring Austria. They were greeted not with bullets and guns, but with roses and carnations. So much so, that the action became known as the "Blumenkrieg", the "War of Flowers". Most of the Austrian people, envying what they saw as the economic success and prestige, that Hitler had brought to Germany, now welcomed their German neighbors. One People, One Reich, One Leader. In a demonstration of how central he was personally to this whole system, Hitler traveled across Austria on a campaign tour. In the future I want to be nothing other than what I have been in the past: alerter of my people, teacher of my people, and the Führer of my people. As German troops cross the border of Austria, Austrian troops simultaneously enter the German cities of Munich, Dresden and Berlin, a sign to the rest of world of a peaceful reunification. An overhelming 99,7% of Austrian citizens will deocratically vote to reunite with Germany. ... and this people... ... do not come to the Reich... ... with hat in hand. I myself... ... bring you home! I think the thing... some period around the end of '37- '38, Hitler feels well this is fine, but I didn't come to power just to restore German self confidence and solve this more, he changed his gear I think. And then getting rid of a number of the old guard, and the army, and the foreign office, and so on. And he becomes more aggressive. It was the 12th of March 1938. Austria was showered with Swastika's. March 12, 1938 He crossed the border near his birth place at Braunau. People rejoiced him, the "Anschluss", which they saw as the fulfillment of an old dream of the German nation. An emphatic display of self determination. A right denied to the German people of the Versailles Treaty, whose terms were generally considered unjust. Visibly moved he entered Vienna. The city that had seen his early failures, now gave him a hero's reception. Homage was being paid to the man who had achieved the unification of the German people. The welcome here was the most tumultuous yet. Heil Adolf Hitler! While in Leonding, Hitler visits the grave of his parents situated across the street from his childhood home. THE BERGHOF - THE BAVARIAN ALPS It was here, far from the millions of his followers, that Hitler felt most able to relax. The inner circle at the "Berghof", saw a quite different man from the charismatic Führer of the party rallies. Life at Hitler's retreat, was both reassuring and agreeable. And their was an entertaining side to the off duty Führer as Ribbentrop's private secretary discovered. "I was overwhelmed by the possibility to meet the Führer personally. And for instance, for the beginning, he was a sort of a Messiah for me. He was a man who liked to joke. He could laugh a lot. He didn't accept two sort of jokes. Dirty jokes and political jokes, they were bad. But all the other jokes he enjoyed terribly." Hitler had no close friends in whom to confide his inner most feelings. He could never admit human weakness to anyone. But the inner circle discovered one secret of his private life, which was unknown to ordinary Germans. "When Hitler was talking for hours and I was standing near to the wall, waiting, until they want some papers or something? And the curtain opened, Eva Braun appeared and says, "Adolf, we must to have lunch now." And she didn't bother him with political questions. And he didn't want to give her influence. And he thought that as long as he is a bachelor, he has the love of the German women. Because if he's married, the impression is not the same on the other women. And she gave him a little bit... a home of bourgeois, a quality with tea, with cake, and I think with sex." You think it was a sexual relationship? "Certainly." In 1919. the Allies at Versailles formed a new country called Czechosovakia. The population will now consists of... 6.7 million Czechs 3.1 million Germans 2.0 million Slovacs 700.000 Hungarians 460.000 Ukrainians With Czech violence against ethnic German minorities on the rise, Sudeten Germans are forced to call for the reunification with Germany. Czech President Edvard Benes will instead order martial law imposed on the Sudeten provinces, forcing a furious Adolf Hitler to demand their return. 26 Sept 1938 I have put an offer to Herr Benes... an offer that is nothing other than reaisation of his promises. The decision is his now! Be it war or peace? He can either accept my offer and give the Germans their freedom, or we Germans will go get it ourselves! 4 POWER CONFERENCE CALLED BY HITLER; AVERTS CZECH INVASION 28 Sept 1938, British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain departs for Germany The Munich Peace Conference "IT IS PEACE WITH HONOUR" SAYS CHAMBERLAIN A wave of relief and gratitude for the Führer swept Germany. His iron nerve had freed the Germans in Czechoslovakia, and yet averted war. You secured us victory... now you secure us peace. Heil Hitler! Sieg heil! Sieg heil! Sieg heil! To be continued Part 4 Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told! The US state department in its 3-volume report on the origins of Communism in Russia, published in 1931, reveals how Jewish controlled German banks under the leadership of Max Warburg conspired as early as 1914 to send large payments to Lenin, Trotsky, and others in their attempts to bring down the Tsar. When the White Russian patriots heroically attempted to regain their freedom from the Jews, the Judaica says compact Jewish masses were utilized by the Bolsheviks to suppress such counter revolution. Clearly Jews and native Russians were engaged in a death struggle over the destiny of Russia. Unfortunately, the Jewish masses won... the Jewish masses won... the Jewish... "We will survive", that's what they tell us. What they mean is, "THEY will survive!" We surrendered in November, at a time when we were perched on the edge of victory, betrayed by the cowards and the traitors within our ranks. "Lousy Communist pigs!" How do we fight them? We unite! We must join together, for a greater Germany! We will hang the profiteers, crush the Communists, we will disinfect our country of the Jewish vermin! We will sacrifice, we will struggle yes, but only then will we triumph. And we will triumph! We will triumph! We will triumph! - We will triumph! We will triumph! We will triumph! We will triumph... What exactly was the "great stab in the back" that Hitler had always talked about? In 1961, former Zionist Benjamin Freedman gave a speech at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C. on the World War One betrayal of the German people. WORLD WAR ONE 1914 was the year in which World War I broke out. Within two years, Germany had won that war. The German submarines, which were a surprise to the world, had swept all the convoys from the Atlantic Ocean, and Great Britain stood there without ammunition for her soldiers, stood there with one week's food supply and after that, starvation. At that time the French army had mutinied; they lost 600.000 of the flower of the French youth. The Russian army was defecting; they didn't like the Tsar, and the Italian Army had collapsed. Not a shot had been fired on the German soil. Not an enemy solider had crossed the border into Germany and yet, here was Germany offering England peace terms. Well, England in the summer of 1916 was considering that, seriously, they had no choice. While that was going on, the Zionists in Germany went to the British war cabinet, "Look here, you can win this war, if the United States will come in as your Ally. The price you must pay us, is Palestine after you have won the war and defeated Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Turkey." They made that promise in October of 1916. Now, that is something that the people in the United States have never been told. They never knew why we went into World War I. After we got into the war, Lord Balfour the Zionists went to Great Britain and they said, "Let's have something in writing that shows that you are going to keep your bargain and give us Palestine after you win the war." And that was called "The Balfour Declaration". The Balfour Declaration was merely Great Britain's promise to pay the Zionists what they had agreed upon as a consideration for getting the United States into the war. That is where all the trouble started." WAR DECLARED BY UNITED STATES Resolution passed by both houses of legislature Army of 2.000.000. Munich, Germany April 1919 Down with the Kaiser! Death to the Kaiser! The Treaty of Versailles on 28 June 1919 and the Treaty of Saint-Germain on 20 September of the same year ensured that German people would be thoroughly humiliated. With millions unemployed, revolucionary Jewish Communist leaders Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg will atempt a "red" revolution. British Prime Minister Lloyd George wrote: "The international bankers swept statesman, politicians and journalists all to one side and issued their orders with the imperiousness of absolute monarchs." The Daily Mail reported 10 July 1933: "The German Nation was rapily falling under control of alien elemens. In the last days of the pre-Hitler regime there were twenty times more Jewish gouverment officials in Germany as had existed before the war." Jews of internationl attachments- and with Communist persuasions- had successfully insinuated into the German administrative sistem. In 1933, as the new National Socialist government is removing these Jews from influential positions, the worldwide Jewish boycott of German goods begins. The German boycott of Jewish business concerns came in April 1933, only after the Jewish declaration of war was announced earlier in March. JUDEA DECLARES WAR ON GERMANY Above all, we must remove the Jews. They run our banks, they lost us the war. They alone are responsible for the economic disaster we're in. "When you ask, what have the Germans done to the Jews, you must always ask, what have done the Jews to the Germans. Since 1850, when the Jews became got all the political rights in Germany, the German Reich; they have done 3 things which are really dramatic. Number 1: They were a small minority of 2% of the population. At the time when Hitler came to power, 500.000 within 60 million German people. 500.000 among 60 million. They were a small minority. This small minority managed to control of about 50% of the media; to give about 70% of all judges; to have a tremendous influence in movie, and in theater, and in literature, they were over-represented. This is one thing, they were absolutely overrepresented as today in England, in France, and in United States. Second, Jews were at the origin of a lot of catastrophic financial bank crashes in Germany between 1870 and 1920. In that time, they made a lot of crashes, which have... This is all documented, it's not Nazi propaganda, or anti-Semitic, or Arab propaganda. It's a lot of books have been published, even by Jewish-Germans, about this problem. They have millions of German fathers have lost their uh, their uh, their incomes their uh their fortune, their savings, because of these Jewish gangsters, bank gangsters and speculation people. Then the third point which was psychologically the most dangerous of all, they have introduced into German art and culture and theater and movie: decadence - immorality. The first homosexual theaters, plays were made in Berlin in the 1920s. The first adultery theater plays were made in the 1880s and the 1890s, a hundred years ago, by Jewish authors, adultery, then sexual perversions of all sorts: sadism, masochism, lot of homosexuality all these things and then the decadent art you know, an art which is absolutely ridiculous, so called modern art, it was all pushed by Jewish intellectuals and this created among the German people, a big, uh, a big revolt. And they also, they wrote books, ridiculing Christianity, ridiculing Jesus. And there were furious reactions in Germany. And this is why Adolf Hitler came to power. And you see then Hitler in two years, from '33 to '35, he brought six million unemployed Germans back into their jobs. He created 6 million jobs. It's incredible." KRISTALLNACHT 9-10 november 1938 The November 1938 assassinion of te German diplomat Ernst von Rath in Paris by te Jew Herschel Grynszpan was the pretext for the progoms agaist the German Jews that followed. At the time, Joseph Goebbels was negotiating to overturn te international Jewish trade embargo. He moved quicky to halt the vioence, fearing it would derail the talks. NAZIS SMASH, LOOT AND BURN JEWISH SHOPS AND TEMPLES UNTIL GOEBBELS CALLS HALT THE TRANSFER AGREEMENT Secret negotiations between the Nazis and the Zionists in 1933, 22 April 1984- Channel 5 News which allowed German Jews and their assets to go to Palestine. The Transfer Agreement The Dramatic Sory of the Pact Between the Third Reich and Jewish Palestine A group of Zionists, at the same time, was quietly negotiating an agreement with the Nazis, to allow the immigration of German Jews and the transfer of their assets to Palestine. That deal, reported in August 1933, was the Transfer Agreement. Palestine, sparsely settled by Jews at the time, was radically changed as a result. I lived in Palestine from 1933 to 1936. And uh, we saw, every week, passports of German Jews, coming to settle in Palestine. German-Jewish settlement of Palestine was, for a time, official Nazi policy. These photos, of Jewish life in Palestine, along with a lengthy text, appeared in 1934, in the Berlin paper, Der Angriff, the publisher, Hitler's propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels. "A Nazi Visits Palestine", was the title of the multi-part series. A medal was struck by Goebbels in commemoration. On one side the Swastika, on the other, The Star Of David. Hitler demanded one concession for the transfer agreement. That the call for a Boycott of the Reich, raised by Jews here and elsewhere, be rejected by the Zionists. The Zionists made that concession. London, England Judea declares war on Germany BOYCOTT ALL GERMAN GOODS THE TRANSFER AGREEMENT The Transfer Agreement was a pact that allowed Jews to emigrate from Germany to Palestine with their wealt intact. This is contrary to all anti-Hitler propaganda. The agreement was concluded in August 1933, following talks between German officials and the Palestine Center of the World Zionist Organisation. Each Jew bound for Palestine deposited money into a special account in Germany. The funds were used to purchase German goods which were exported to Palestine and sold there by the Jewish-owned Haavara company in Tel Aviv. Profits from the sales were then given to the Jewish emigrant upon his arrival, an amount corresponding to the initial deposit in Germany. Thus, the agreement served the Zionist aim of bringing Jewish settlers and development capital to Palestine, whilst simultaneously advancing the German goal of freeing the country of an unwanted alien group. As a result, Hitler's government vigorously supported the emigration of Jews to Palestine from 1933 until 1940-41, when the Second World War prevented futher collaboration. HITLER'S JEWISH SOLDIERS Approximately 150.000 soldiers with Jewish blood would eventually fight for the armed forces on the Third Reich. These included: 2 Field Marrshals 15 Generals 8 Lieutenant Generals 5 Major Generals Together they commanded up to 100.000 troops. 20 Jews would also win the Reich's highest military honour, the Knight's Cross. 1/2 Jew Werner Goldberg 1/2 Jew Horst Geitner Received Iron Cross 2nd Class and The Silver Wound Badge 1/2 Jew Johannes Zukertort 1/2 Jew Colonel Walter H. Hollaender Emil Maurice was a personal friend of Hitler's, and his one-time chauffer and bodyguard. He was also an early member of the NSDAP and one of the founders of the SS. The Führer stood by his old friend when Maurice's Jewish ancestry was discovered, declaring him an "Honorary Aryan". He was allowed to remain in the SS... To be continued Part 5 Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told! On 28 June 1914 Serbian radical Gavrilo Princip assassinated Austrian Archduke Franc Ferdinand in Sarajevo. One month later on 28 July 1914 Austria declared war on Serbia, initiating World War One. Munich, Germany May 1914 Come closer! Let me speak! England, France and Russia are joining forces against our ally Austria. We must stand with her, united, ready to sacrifice. Eventually the victorious Allies would hold Germany alone for World War One. The next twenty years would see the German population suffer terribly from the consequences of the Treaty of Versailles. To understand the causes of World War Two, we must first studi the aftermath of World War One. The allied leaders were arguing their way over the whole future of the German people. Under their hands the map of Europe was drawn, and re-drawn again. At last, after more than three months of discussion, they presented the terms of their treaty to the Germans. Germany lost land in the East, the West, and the North. In the East, the most important of those losses was the wide strip of territory given to the newly independent Poland, separating East Prussia from the rest of Germany. While on the West, France took back the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine. And was also given the right to mine coal in the Saar, an area placed under League of Nations control for 15 years. To protect France, Germany was forbidden to station soldiers in the Rhineland, an area which was to be occupied by Allied troops until 1935. It was not only the loss of territory which Germany resented, but also the fact that Czechoslovakia and Poland, now contained large numbers of Germans. And as if to add insult to injury, the treaty forbade German speaking Austria to unite with Germany. Her fortifications were to be destroyed. Her army was to be reduced to a 100.000 men. No Air Force. No submarines. And to accept blame for starting the War and pay reparations. So, in the high summer of 1919, the German delegates were brought to the great Hall of Mirrors of Versailles to sign the peace treaty. It was a compromised peace that satisfied not even one single Allied leader, and predictably the Germans loathed it. The Germans argued that the Germany, to which they were returning had suffered poverty and unemployment in the years since the war, and couldn't afford the vast sums demanded by the Allies. But these arguments didn't impress the Allies, who fixed the sum of 6.600.000.000 pounds for the Germans to pay. That sum would have to be paid in goods as well as money. Most would come from here in the Ruhr, the industrial heart of Germany. But at the end of 1922, the Germans fell behind with their payments, and Raymond Poincare, the new French Prime Minister, decided to act. If Germany wouldn't pay in full and on the nail, then France would help herself. So, on the 11th of January, 1923, French and Belgian troops entered the Ruhr to force the Germans to pay up. There was of course, after Versailles, no German army big enough to stop them. At first, the French believed that they could make the Germans work for them. But suddenly, German politicians and people were united in a common cause; hatred of the French. And huge protest meetings were held all over Germany. Their attitude towards the Germans in the Ruhr began to harden. They tried to cut off the Ruhr off from the rest of the country. German visitors were searched as if they were entering a foreign land. 1923 was disastrous for Germany. In that year, the great German inflation reached its peak. For some time the value of the Mark had been dropping. As the value of the notes decreased, so the amounts of notes needed to buy things grew. Banks became more and more hard pressed, to meet the ever-increasing demand for paper money. Closed For their customers, suitcases replaced wallets. As Germany slipped towards disaster, Gustav Stresemann was appointed Chancellor. The loss of production in the Ruhr was making inflation even worse, and Stresemann realized that the only way to help the economy back to normal, was to call off resistance there, and get production going again. The government also announced that Germany would resume the payment of reparations; it was the only possible way of getting the French out. But to the nationalists, it looked like again another pathetic surrender to Germany's enemies. General Ludendorff, who had never accepted that Germany had ever been defeated, gave his support to Adolf Hitler, the leader of the new National Socialist party. 1939 THE POLISH CONFLICT Problems had arisen in Poland over access to the German territory of East Prussia and coastal city of Danzig. Hitler on several occasions presented proposals to try and resolve both situations peaceably, but the Poles refused to seriously negotiate. Now in Poland, just like in Czechoslovakia, the safety of ethnic Germans was again becoming a concern for Hitler. DANZIG Until 1934, conflicts between Germany and Poland smoldered. Danzig, next to East Prussia, had been completely cut off from the Reich. Warsaw continued to try to rest total control over this strategically important harbor city. In West Prussia, the situation was similar. East Prussia was now completely cut off from the German Reich. Bolstered by English and French guarantees of war support, Poland has no further incentive to negotiate in good faith with Germany, and in the meantime in Warsaw, maps are suddenly starting to circulate which contain a new Western-Polish border, extending to just West of Berlin. All across Poland, the so-called pogroms against the minorities begin. Night after night, polish border officials shot at the fleeing Germans. Shortly before the official outbreak of war, there were already 80.000 ethnic Germans in refugee camps in both Danzig and the German Reich. The misery of the minority Germans in Poland had now developed the third and most pressing reason that would lead to the outbreak of war. "The democratic states should not be vain as to think this state of affairs will last forever." Adolf Hitler 1939 THE DANZIG MASSACRES Hitler now has a problem that Britain and France will declare war on them. At this point, Poland is actually committing, pretty bad atrocities against the German minority in West Prussia, in the German part of Poland at that time. And so given that Poles are committing atrocities against the German minority in Poland, Hitler is now at a very tough situation. Basically it's like, alright if I don't declare war on Poland, if I don't go in and help these Germans out, well then, the German minorities are just going to keep getting slaughtered. And it's not an insignificant amount of Germans in that area who are being killed, it was pretty bad what was going on, what the Poles were doing in that area. And so, he was basically saying well, if we don't go in, then those Germans are just going to keep getting slaughtered. If we go in, we're going to find ourselves at war with Poland, France, and Britain, and possibly the Soviet Union. But in a move of brilliant cunning, he astonished the world in the summer of 1939, by doing a deal with Stalin. With Stalin on his side, Hitler was sure nobody else would interfere, when he attacked the Poles. German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop Whilst the military commissions of the Western powers are still negotiating in Moscow with a view of enlisting Russia in their front against Germany, Reich Foreign Minister Von Ribbentrop flies to the Soviet capital to sign a pact of non-aggression and consultation with Mr. Stalin and Foreign Commissar Molatov. 1 SEPTEMBER 1939 Applause greets the Führer who has just arrived at the Kroll Opera House to address the Reichstag, which has been called in an extraordinary session. "Danzig was and is a German city. to have only Germany to thank for their cultural development. I told the Polish ambassador three weeks ago, that if the situation continued as it was, if Danzig was persecuted, and if it were attempted by Poland to ruin Danzig economically, the situation could not be tolerated." "We interrupt this broadcast of Adolf Hitler's speech just moments early, to report a dispatch from Paris, which says that Premier Daladier of France, has now called the French Council of Ministers for an emergency meeting." Polish troops are mobilised "I, therefore, resolve to speak to Poland in the same language in which Poland has addressed us for such a long time." Danzig is liberated the same day "Once again we interrupt very briefly. This talk by Chancellor Hitler, to announce that, in London, Parliament has been summoned to meet at 6 pm in London." "Poland, for the first time, this evening, has shot at regular soldiers upon our territory. From now on, bomb will be met by bomb." Poland had greatly underestimate the German armed forces. The tactic of attacking the enemy with great speed known as Blitzkrieg, or "lightning war", is utterly devstating. The plight of the German minorities had become clear. During the last weeks before the outbreak of war, racial propaganda in the Polish press played a major role in the persecution of Germans already hounded and harrassed. Acts of violence against the Germans continue, and would eventually include a total of 58.000 slaughtered. The worst massacres will take place between 31August and 6 September. The climax came on 3 September in Bromberg, in what is known as "Bloody Sunday". The mass murders would only end on 18 September with the arrival of German troops near Lowitsch. Those found guilty of taking part in the brutal killings now faced dead by firing squad. LONDON, ENGLAND 3 SEPTEMBER 1939 "I am speaking to you, from the Cabinet Room, at 10 Downing Street. This morning, the British ambassador in Berlin, handed the German government, a final note, stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock, that they were prepared at once, to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us. I have to tell you now, that no such undertaking has been received, and that, consequently, this country is at war with Germany." To be continued Part 6 Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told! Within two days, the issues involving the human rights of German minorities, as well as the disputies over Danzig and isolated East Prussia, would turn into World War Tho. From the beginning the civilian population feels the jmpact of the invasion. As casualties mount Polish civilians, with the full support of their military, hunt down any Germans still in Poland. Following the invasion, there is a wave of house searches; ethnic Germans are beaten and raped, with at last 5.000 murdered. The massacres, especially in the sity of Bromberg, will be hidden from the history books. They will eventually emerge as one of the most henious of crimes to be inflicted upon a civil population. DANZIG 16 SEPTEMBER 1939 As a soldier in the World War who only fought in the West... I never had the opportunity to witness such deeds... the thousands of slaughtered Volksgennossen... the brutally butchered women and children... the countless German soldiers and officers who fell, wounded... in the hands of the enemy and who were massacred and bestially mutilated with their eyes gouged out... and worse yet, the Polish government has openly admitted this in a radio broadcast... the Lufttwaffe soldiers, thet were forced to parachute, were to be killed in a cowardly fashion. THE GERMAN-SOVIET NON-AGGRESSION PACT In securing the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact with the Soviets and offering Stalin the Eastern half of Poland, Hitler hopes that the Russian presence there will prevent Britain and France from declaring war. This would now allow Hitler to protect the German minorities, and at same time reclaim the teritories lost at Versailles. Although both Germany and Soviets invade Poland, war by the Allies is only declared on Germany. On 17 September 1939, Stalin invades Poland and claims the Eastern teritory as agreed. Meanwhile, Hitler on three separate occasions, offers the opportunity of uncondicional surrender to the Polish commander in Warsaw. Poland refuses all ultimatums und the German assault begins. Warsaw capitulates in just 24 hours at the cost of 40.000 dead or injured. The war with Poland last just 29 days. Hitler didn't want a general war, what he wanted, and I have no doubt about this, he wanted a war to destroy Poland. That he was prepared for. For a moment, he was disconcerted to find that he might be involved in war with Britain and France, because, this had never been his plan. He had always regarded Britain as his natural allien. But, in the end, he accepted. 'Look, I have a Nazi-Soviet pact, which guarantees that this will not develop into a general war. I shall be able to knock Poland out in three weeks, which he more or less did. After that, the West isn't going to start up a war again. PLANS FOR A LONG WAR CHURCHILL IS NEW NAVY CHIEF MAY 1940 In theirs quests to prevent Germany from reclaiminig territory lost under the Treaty of Versailles, Britain and France refuse any offers of peace. In reality, they are worried about Germany's rapid economic growth, and will not suffer futher German advancement. At stake are the British and French empires, with the British alone ruling over 480 million people. French Empire 1919- 1939 British Empire 1919- 1939 10 May 1940 With French troops mobilising and more British troops arriving on the mainland by the day, Germany has no alternative but to go on the offensive. The British Establishment replaced Nevil Chamberlain as Prime Minister, shoosing Winston Churchill instead. The same day Hitler invades France trough Belgium. The armies of Britain and France are no much for this new German war machine. There will be no World War One trench warfare, as the tactic of the Blitzkrieg once again proves devastating. In a matter of weeks the Germans seize vital territory and resources in Europe, and eventually outtlank and trap the Allies on the coast of France. With their backs against the English Channel, both the world's leading colonial armies face total annihilation. Hitler delays the attack for two days, leaving the British time for chaotic evacuation from the Port of Dunkirk. Althout most histrians see this as a gesture of peace, others still insist it was a military blunder. Humiliated, the British Empire now has to rely on civilian sailing vessels and merchant fishing boats to help ferry troops back across the English Channel. With all their heavy artillery, tenks and armoured vehicles left on the shores of France, they are a spent force, but will look for other means of continuing the war. Six weeks of German Blitzkrieg defeats France. Paris is Hitler's. Hitler will have the French authorities surrender at Compiegne using the very same carriage in which the Germans had been compelled to ask for an armistice in World War One. Carriage No. 2149D was rolled out of its protective building to the precise spot it occupied on 11 Nov 1919. 1940 FRANCE France asked Hitler for an armistice. Shortly before 3 o'clock, on the afternoon of June 21st, 1940, he arrived in the forest of Compiegne. Hitler himself took the seat where Marshall Foch had sat. The French delegation led by General Huntziger followed closely behind. When the French delegation entered the carriage, Hitler could fully relish the peak of his career. Long ago on entering politics, he had sworn never to rest until the shame of November 1918 had been wiped out. Now, he had done it. But the dream of his lifetime, he said, had been fulfilled. 1940 BERLIN Berlin greeted him with flowers of jubilation. Hitler's triumphal return to Berlin, sent a flood of respect and adulation. "The church bells rang all day, and the mood of elation really penetrated throughout the country." "My feelings towards Hitler were such as if he were some super human being between man and a God, sent by Providence." This was the man who had obliterated the humiliation of The First World War. The same day in a speech at the Reichstag Hitler presented Britain with yet another offer of peace. LONDON, ENGLAND Secret government documents reveal that a British received over a dozen offers of peace between 1939 and 1941, despite their desperate military straits after the evacuation at Dunkirk. Prime Minister Winston Churchill however would have none of it. Because he is aware Britain cannot defeat Germany alone, he will do his utmost to drag the US into the war. It will however mean the eventual loss of the British Empire. 1940 BRITAIN Germany was absolutely in a position to direct the course of the war. All we had to defeat now, we believed, was Britain. The German fighter ace, Adolf Galland, also thinks the next priority is the Battle of Britain, but when he meets Hitler, he discovers that the Führer's priorities are different. Galland: "I told him that our good time would come, and we could bomb London and the fighters could... the English fighters couldn't take off. He said "No, no, no, no... stop this. I don't like this. I really don't like the fight against England. The English people are so similar people to the Germans, and I have the highest respect for the English building up an empire. So, you must understand, I'm forced to fight this fight against England, but I don't like it." I think that he himself had not got any great wish to engage on an invasion of Britain, because all the time by now we know, he was already beginning to get itchy, and wanting to turn eastwards, after defeating France. But Göring insisted that with the Luftwaffe, with the Air Force alone, he could knock Britain out. So he gave him his head to try. Initially, Hitler had insisted that only military installations were to be bombed. However, on 4 Sept 1940, he explained in a speech to the Reichstag, way after months of British targeting German civilians in nightly bombing raids, he now has no choice but to retaliate in kind. "While the German planes fly over English land day by day no Englishman has managed to so much as cross the North Sea by daylight. That is way they come at night and drop their bombs, you know it well, indiscriminately and on civilian residents, farms and villages. Wherever they see a light, they drop a bomb. I did not answer for three months because I was of an opinion they would stop this nonsense. Mr. Churchill perceived this as a sign of our weakness. You will surely understand that we are now giving our answers night after night, and this at an increasing rate." To be continued Part 7 Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told! Hello America, this is Edward Murrow speaking from London. There were more German planes over the coast of Britain today than at any time since the war begun. Despite the British Empire's vast resources, and vast the millions of men at her disposal, including... 1 million Australians 2 million Indians 1 million Canadians ... Churchill and Roosevelt will push for the US to enter the war. However, polls consistently show that ordinary Americans have no wish to be involved in what to them is yet another Europian civil war. In spite on this, Roosevelt will now force laws through Congress making a mockery of the US's supposed neutrality. in favor of one-sided supply of arms to Germany's enemies. The same year, Roosevelt freezes all assets of defeated European countries, refusing to recognise their recognise their new governments. The "Destroyers for US Bases" agreement is passed, whereby 50 reconditioned US Navy destroyers are transfered to the Royal Navy in exchange for British bases in the Caribbean. Roosevelt will persuade congress to pass the Lend-Lease Act which officially ends his pretense of being neutral. He will also allow American citizens to enter the British Air Force. Roosevelt freezes all German assets in the US, a violation of international law. The US announces an oil embargo against "aggressor" nations. $ 1 billion dollars in Lend-Lease aid is sent to Britain. The US will eventually ship a total of $ 31.4 billion worth of supplies, the equivalent of $ 445 billion in today's money. The loans will take Britain 61 years to repay, with the last installment made in 2006. By an overwhelming majority congress passed Lend-Lease... bill number 1776. I've asked this congress for authority and for funds, sufficient to manufacture additional munitions and war supplies of many kinds, to be turned over to those nations which are now in actual war, with aggressor nations. Our most useful and immediate roll, is to act as an arsenal for them as well as for ourselves. We shall send in ever increasing numbers: ships, planes, tanks, guns. That is our purpose and our pledge. The enormous amount of US funds, along with the covert US operations in the Atlantic help Britain sustain the war against Germany. The quick knockout blow Göring had hoped for now seemed unlikely, and the Battle of Britain will shortly give way to a more important fight. Hitler will now concentrate on the battle he believes will eventually the outcome of World War Two. On 11 December 1941, he gives a speech describing the growing Soviet menace. "Already in 1940 it became increasingly clear from month to month that the plans of the Kremlin were aimed at the domination, and thus the destruction of Europe. Only a blind person could fail to see that a military build-up of unique world-historical proportions was being carried out." Clearly the Soviet Union had been expanding West. 30 November 1939- Finland is atacked. 21 February 1940- Sweden is bombed. 18 June 1940- Estonia, Latvia, Lithuaia are invaded. 27 June 1940- Romania is forced by Stalin to surrender Bessarabia. Hitler feels that not only is Germany in grave danger, but indeed the whole of Europe. He knows the horrors the Bolsheviks will bring. Rather than wait, after meeting with his generals, Hitler will now plan a pre-emptive strike against the Soviet Union, in what will be known as Operation Barbarossa. To understand Hitler's fears for Europe, we must first look at the Bolshevik regime and Stalin, the man President Roosevelt would affectionately call "Uncle Joe". STALIN Stalin came to power on the death of Lenin, and ruled the Soviet Union by fear and torture for nearly the next 30 years. During that time, he was responsible for some 40 million deaths. Stalin spent his first years in power consolidating his position. He managed to sideline Trotsky, whom he perceived as his major rival. In 1929 Stalin implemented a policy known as collectivization. Lenin's experiment in nationalizing the land had remained half finished, and Russian peasants were still working their own land and selling their own produce in the markets. By means of collectivization, Stalin meant to complete Lenin's initiative, and to take away all of the peasants lands and produce in the name of the state. In 1930, peasant's produce began to be collected up. The Red Army one-by-one seized the produce from every single field. Some peasants managed to hide their goods rather than give them up, but communist party officials searched every nook and cranny eventually discovering the hiding places. The officials also seized the peasant's agricultural equipment. The peasants were left with nothing to eat, and nothing to work the soil with. Eventually, that catastrophe that Lenin had described as the most useful for communism raised its head again... famine. In Ukraine alone, 6 million people starved over the next few years. 2 million died in Kazakhstan and 1 million in northern Caucasus. Children reduced to skin and bone died in agony. There was another ghastly result of the famine inspired by Stalin - cannibalism. Peasants maddened by hunger began to eat corpses. Then an even worse horror emerged, some peasants had kidnapped children and eaten them. In front of these two Russian peasants caught eating human flesh, lay the remains of the children they had snatched. Stalin's regime had turned human beings into savage animals just as communism had intended. Everyone who opposed Stalin's collectivization policy paid with his life. Tens of thousands of Kulaks were detained and shot. In actual fact, the regime branded everyone it saw as opposed to its ideology as Kulaks. Large numbers of priests and even members of their congregations, who attended church frequently were arrested as Kulaks. Some were executed. Others were sent to the labor camps, where a slow lingering death awaited them. These camps were set up all over Russia and were simply another of Stalin's killing machines. Millions of people regarded as enemies of the state were worked to death in them under the most terrible conditions. Some were put to work laboring on canals in the blazing heat, others were sent off to break rocks in the freezing cold of Siberia. These people, forced to perform hard labor under the worst possible conditions, soon turned into living skeletons. The great majority never left the camps alive. The Soviet Union, like every communist country, was an economic basket case. It could not produce enough to survive. And so, every communist / socialist state has been dependent upon aid from the capitalist producing states. So, Russia was desperate for our aid, both in terms of direct government aid, but also in terms of opening up the spigots for private capital markets, particularly New York bankers and corpor- ations to move into Russia in a big way. In 1933 the Roosevelt administration invited a Soviet representative to Washington to negotiate terms of diplomatic recognition. Number of Deaths in Ukraine 1941 POLAND Hans Frank is appointed governor-general of Poland and the country disappears from the headlines of the world press. Jews must wear the Star of David on their arm, not carry it in their pocket. In Warsaw there is a streetcar exclusively for Jews. A district a mile and a half square is transformed into a ghetto. There is condemnation from the Allies over the Jewish ghetto, and yet it bears no comparison to the many black ghettos in Amerika, a country where Negroes were still being lynched, and hanged from trees. Britain's record on the "human rights" of the subjects in her many colonies is likewise cruel and racist. Winston Churchill served in the Boer War when thousends of women and children were left to starve in British concentration camps. No one was ever brought to account for the many crimes against humanity in... India Africa Australia ... or for the mass drugging of the population of China in the Opium Wars. MEXICAN REPATRIATION ACT In the US, the years between 1929 and 1939 saw the forced deportation of 2 million Mexicans, as first authorised by Presdent Herbert Hoover. Of those, 1.2 million were born American citizens. The final US Army massacre of the "Indians" occurs, at Wounded Knee, South Dakota. By 1924, they are almost completely wiped out. Children that survive are sent to boarding schools for re-education, where teachers are instructed to... "kill the Indian in them" AMERICAN RACISM Throughout World War Two and up until the 1960's, a majority of American States enforced segregation trough the use of "Jim Crow" laws. States could impose legal punishment on those consorting with members of different race. The most common types of laws forbade intermarriage, and mandated that businesses and public institutions segregate blacks and whites. Here is just a sampling of the various State laws: ARIZONA Intermarriage: The marriage of a person with Caucasian blood with a Negro, Mongolian, Malaysian, or Hindu shall be null and void. FLORIDA Cohabitation: Any Negroes or White person who are not married to each other, and occupy the nighttime in the same room, shell be punished by imprisonment or fine. MISSOURI Intermarriage: All marriages between... White persons and Negroes or Mongolians are prohibited and declared absolutely void. President Franklin D. Roosevelt had time and time again resisted any Republican Party efforts to pass a Federal law prohibiting lynching. In 1922, future President Harry Truman joined the Ku Klux Klan. 1936 BERLIN THE MYTH OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES Anti-Germn propaganda in the US claim that a furious Hitler had ignored four-time Olympic gold medalist Jesse Owens. In his 1970 autobiography Owens wrote: "When I passed the Chancellor he arose, waved his hand at me, and I waved back at him. I think the writers shoved bad taste in criticism the man of the hour in Germany." On his return to the US, Owens will not be invited to the White House. He later said, "Hitler didn't snub me - it was FDR who snubbed me. The President didn't even send me a telegram. The Olympic champion later had to make a living by racing horses. In 1960, almost a quarter of a century later, a young Casius Clay threw his Olympic gold medal into the Ohio river after a waitress in a resturant told him... "We don't serve Niggers here." To be continued Part 8 Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told! Italy, which had allied with Germany in 1940, was now fighting the British in Greece and in the Middle East. War had broken out in the Balkans, where the worst atrocites of World War Two would soon take place. Before Germany could invade the Soviet Union, Hitler would first have to send the Vehrmacht to help secure these regions. Within six weeks, the British would be forced to retreat from both Greece and the Middle East. In Yugoslavia, the British-backed government is quickly overthrown. Croatia is now independent for the first time in 900 years. To this day, many Croats honour Adolf Hitler as a liberator. THE JAPANESE CONFLICT Troughout the 1930's Japan has been at war with China. When Japan allied with Germany and Italy in 1940, the new Vichy French government consented to the Japanese occupation of France's Indochina colonies. The British Empire however, which also had colonies in the region, together with the US froze Japan's assets in July 1941. NEW YORK TIMES, 26 JULY 1941 "The measures, in effect, bring all financial and import and export trade transactions in which Japanese inerests are involved under the kontrol of the US government." On 1 August 1941, Roosevelt - still looking for a way to enter the war - forced an oil embrgo on Japan, an intentional act of hostility. Both these actions were taken before fateful December 7 Pearl Harbour attack. The results: Japan lost access to 75 % of her oversaes trade and 88 % of her imported oil. Soon there be insufficient resources to continue war with China. To try and resolve this the Japanese entered into negotiations with US officias, who demanded that Japan first withdraw from China before the embargoes would end. The Japanese would never permit themselves to be humbled in such a way... ... a fact which Roosevelt must have known. In his book "Icebreaker", Russian historian Victor Suvorov gives compelling proff that Hitler was forced into a reluctant pre-emptive strike against massive Soviet military machine poised to invade whole of Western Europe. Suvorov quotes top secret Soviet documents which make it crystal clear that Soviet military was being built as an offensive force. The collateral damage inflicted on the eleven Europaan countries involved in Hitler's defensive measures against Britain and France had created an unprecedented situation where their armies, governments, and political parties had been destryed. Now with Europe totaly exposed, Stalin is hoping Germany will expand the war by sending troops to Britain. Instead, he is caught completely off guard as 3 million soldiers prepare to invade the atheisti Soviet Union wearing belt buckles engraved with the words... Gott Mit Uns From the Balic to the Black Sea three million German soldiers, are moving into position 22 JUNE 1941 OPERATION BARBAROSSA to launch Operation Barbarossa. It's the most brutal conflict between two nations in recorded history, is about to begin. On the first day of Barbarossa alone, 1.200 Soviet aircraft are destroyed in a single strike. Panzer units sweeping East, are already deep inside Soviet territory. Chaos multiplies the catastrophe. Without orders from the Kremlin, Red Army field Commanders lose control of their units. Dazed, cut off, surrounded, thousands of Soviet soldiers surrender. And at the height of the Wehrmacht's furious onslaught, Stalin disappears completely. He has every reason to hide from his people. Captured German news real footage, shows Soviet frontier troops overwhelmed. A retreat under fire in total confusion. Whole formations surrendering. Hundreds of thousands of men entangled with fleeing civilians in scenes of Biblical disorder. Yet, there are some Soviet citizens who welcome the invader. To many in the Ukraine, the arrival of the Germans is a heaven sent opportunity to throw off Stalin's yoke. Local women bless the Germans as they pass. Their men folk destroy reminders of a man who has terrorized them for years. Stalin is above all stunned by the shear speed of the German advance. Still the Germans drive East. They're at the outskirts of Kiev, Smolensk, and Leningrad. Yet fierce pockets of Red Army resistance fight on behind enemy lines. The fortress city of Brisk. The besieged Red Army garrison fights on and on, for more than a month until they are finally compelled to surrender. Hitler is so impressed by the tenacity of the Russian troops, that he exercises rare clemency. Only one survivor is shot. The Political Officer at the fortress Mikhail Fomin. The Führer sights the defense of Brest as an heroic effort. An example to his own soldiers. And he visits the fortress with Mussolini, to acknowledge a hard earned victory. But for Stalin, the defenders of Brest are not heroes. Years later, after they're released from German capture, he will send survivors to the Gulag. The Wehrmacht's rapid relentless advance seems unstoppable. Traveling at up to 50 miles a day, Panzer divisions are already approaching the heart of Stalin's empire. And in the middle of July, Stalin is forced to consider offering the Germans a negotiated peace. While Stalin contemplates a way out of the war, he is drawing up plans to punish his own troops if they surrender. In a desperate attempt to halt the route, he issues order No. 270. All officers and Political Officials taken prisoner at the front, are to be considered traitors. If ever they return to the Soviet Union, they will be arrested and executed. But the barbarity of order 270 does not stop there. The wives of captured troops also face imprisonment in the Gulag. Hitler now forms the Einsatzgruppen units for the necessry removal of the die-hard Bolshevik leadership and NKVD, from all Soviet towns and cities. However, on hearing of the German invasion, many civilians refuse to wait and take immediate revenge on their Communist oppressors and associated collaborators. Meanwhile, Roosevelt extends the Land-Lease Act, and sends more financial and military aid to the Soviet Union to help keep the Communist regime in the war. Stalin is now rumored to have suffered a breakdown. Now with Moscow in range of the Luftwaffe, Stalin's own citadel of power comes directly under attack. German Armies race for the Capital. Elsewhere, army group North heads for Leningrad. Army group Center makes a pincer movement towards Smolensk. Army group South strikes towards Kiev and the Ukraine. The suburbs of Kiev, the beginning of August. In a fast pincer movement, German army group South, threatens to encircle the city. During August and the first two weeks of September, the Wehrmacht encircles a vast area crammed with Red Army troops. Four Soviet Armies parish. On the 18th of September the city falls. The Führer is now lord of all he surveys. It seems as if he is on course to meet his objective. To crush Stalin's Russia before winter sets in. Leningrad lies ahead of the Wehrmacht, defenseless. As September draws to a close, Leningrad is totally cut off with no land link left to the Soviet Union. At the end of September, the Führer launches Operation Typhoon, the final drive alone the road to Moscow. 14 German tank and 74 infantry divisions, a total of 1.8 million officers and men, take part in the offensive. Stalin has good cause for panic now. Facing a disaster that might sweep away the whole Soviet Union, they have one last hope, that the weather will save them. Sleet is turning to snow. The ground frozen at night is now a quagmire during the day, paralyzing Hitler's overstretched war machine. On the 2nd of December, German units reach Krasnaya Polyana, 17 miles from the center of Moscow. As the weather intensifies and temperatures plummet, the bleak truth is time turns decisively against them. 5 DAYS LATER... AND AFTER 5 MONTHS OF US SANCTIONS... PEARL HARBOUR, HAWAII 7 DECEMBER 1941 Two Army Privates running the Opana radar station, are suddenly startled by blips on the screen. Fifty planes headed for Owahu. Immediately they report the sightings to the Army Operations Center. They're dismissed as US planes coming from the mainland. Aircraft designated for the second wave of the attack take off. Messenger boy Tadao Fuchikami, picks up General Marshall's urgent cable for delivery to General Short. Commander Fuchida's first wave armada is on course. Sleepy-eyed sailors and Marines, their breakfast getting cold, mistake the attack for some crazy kind of air raid drill. They think the planes are American. At 7:55 AM, dive bombers hit Hickam and near airfields. Two minutes later, torpedo planes start their bomb on battleship row. Three minutes later, Zero's strafe other airbases. It's Fuchida's first wave of aircraft that hits the Arizona; she erupts like a volcano. Flames burst 500 feet in the air. Fuchida's deadly first waves sinks the West Virginia. Now, the Oklahoma, a battle wagon moored outboard of the US Maryland shutters with torpedo hits. She begins listing... and capsizes. More torpedo's rip into the battleships California and Nevada. After the last bomb is dropped the United States of America virtually has a Pacific Fleet... no longer. Japan Attacks Pearl Harbor And Then Declares War on U.S. Yesterday, December 7th, 1941, A date which will live in infamy, the United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by Naval and Air Forces of the Empire of Japan. On 8 December 1941, the US declares war on Japan and officially enters World War Two. Britain will declare war the same day. Was the attack really such a suprise? JAPAN MAY STRIKE OVER WEEKEND KURUSU BLUNTLY WARNED NATION READY FOR BATTLE To be continued Part 9 Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told! 1941 THE UKRAINE We knew there was a war on. By that time, what was left of us was herded into the cattle trains and shipped to Siberia. That was literally a matter of hours if not minutes until our turn. And we were already sitting at the railroad station - this was September 1941 when the German Army overran the Ukraine, and stopped the exiling; stopped the trains. They stopped the trains. And it was to us as if the Lord had sent us the angels. Here were people who stopped the terror that had been upon us for 25 years. Who came and opened the churches for us and said: "You can have all the services you want". It was like heaven. My mother, to the day she died, never stopped talking about the wonderful 2 years that she had when the German Army came. They took over the houses - we gave them gladly! It was magnificent! And we were absolutely convinced that the Germans had come to save us from Communism. And never was there any reason for us to change our minds - why should we? The Germans were heroes in our eyes. We absolutely believed in Adolf Hitler, we believed in the, in the nature of his struggle, in the merits of his struggle. We had these magnificent German soldiers protecting us, so the beginning was not at all unpleasant. But then it became grim, then the winter came. On 11 December 1941, four days after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, Hitler spoke to the Reichstag in Berlin and dealt at lenght with President Roosevelt hostile policies toward Germany. He detailed the increasingly belligernt actions of Roosevelt's government, and dramatically announced Germany was now joining Japan in the war against the US. Italy and Croatia would soon follow suit. The Independent State of Croatia, commonly reffered to us the NDH, is created 10 April 1941. Led by Ante Paveliæ, several hundred Ustae militia will travel from training camps in Italy to form the new government. They will govern most of modern day Croatia including Bosnia and Herzegovina, and will seek to clear out ethnic Serbs, Jews and Romany gypsies. However, one third of all ethnic Serbs will be spared death or deportation by converting from Serbian Orthodox to Roman Cathoic. This is not dissimilar to what English Protestants offered the Catholics during the Middle Ages. In Jerusalem, Hitler will ally with the Grand Mufti Muhammad Haj Amin al-Husseini, and together Croat and Muslim in Bosnia form the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar. Few historians have ever asked way so many foreigners supported a supposedly "racist" Hitler. The Arabs and the Japanese would not be the only non-Whites to fight on the side of the Third Reich. Africans, Slavs, Asians, Hindus, Arabs and numerous other nationalities all fought shoulder-to-shoulder with Germans. Hitler's Wehrmacht and Waffen SS were in reality the most culturally, ethnicaly and religiously diverse military forces in Western history. Ustae With uncompromising hatred, fanatical nationalism and die-hard religious beliefs all in play, the horrors about to occur in the Balkans are unparalleled. Yugoslavia will become a war zone of competing political interests and disparate ideologies, including Socialism, Fascism, Commuism, Monarchism, and Serbian and Croatian nationalism. It is well-documented and undeniable that the fiercely nationalistic and fanatical Croatian Ustae persecuted Jews. Communists are perceived enemies of the state, holding them in camps such as those at Jasenovac. The Croats had been victims themselves however, having suffered terriby at the hands of the Serbs and Bolshevik partisans. Indeed, the Ustae's elite unit- the Black Legion - was formed on 3 Sptember 1941 by the Croat and Muslim survivors who had fled Sarajevo after seeing their families butchred by Serbs and Chetniks. They eventually earned a reputation as the most brutal and ruthless of Ustae units with a motto of... "No quarter asked, none given." Their finest hour came in the defence of the town Kupres where, although heavily outnumbered, they and other Ustae units successfully defended the civilian population against four Communist partisan regiments, preventing their certain death. When the war ends, after successfuly escaping the Communists, hundreds of thousands of Croat soldiers throw down their weapons and surrender to the Western Allies at the Austrian border town of Bleiburg. However, the British Army will trick the unarmed POWs and their families into boarding trains supposedly heading West. The trains will instead trasport them East, over the border to Yugoslavia, and towards certain death at the hands of the victorious partisans led by Marshal Josip Tito. On arrival, they are dragged from the tranis and the men shot. The women and children are forced on foot to prison camps where, along the way, many are raped, beaten or murdered. Hidden from the history books, it is the worst massacre of 20th century Europe, and became known in Croatia as: "The Bleiburg Massacre" THE BATTLE OF MOSCOW In the dark days of Autumn 1941, the Summers' defeats have decimated the Red Army, and Hitler's artillery could strike Moscow itself. Soviet Union seems on the brink of total defeat. But Stalin has his back to the wall and he will stop at nothing to protect his power base. Hitler and the Allies, expect the fall of Moscow at any moment. In the capital, an agitated Stalin entrusts the defense to general Zhukov. And it is his suggestion at the end of November, of a counter-attack against the German pincers that triggers hurried planning for a massive Soviet counter-offensive. It is a plan made possible by the seemingly limitless depth of Red Army reserves. His agent in Tokyo, Richard Sorge, has sent word that Japan will not as feared, attack the USSR from Manchuria. And for once, crucially, Stalin trusts the advice of a minion. He authorizes the transfer West of more than half the Soviet strength in the Far East. 17 fresh divisions, trained regulars with full armored and artillery support, that will form the heart of the counter-attack. The first days of December are an agony of anticipation, but on the 5th Zhukov unleashes his armies. Within 48 hours the Soviet thrusts are fully underway. Hitler's furious order to hold advanced positions is meaningless. The Red Army's new T-34 tanks are rugged, powerful fighting machines designed to perform unfailingly in the bitter cold of deepest Winter. And swarms of specialist ski troops are too fast for the ill-clad Wehrmacht. German troops can only fall back in astonished disarray. As army groups enter, the juggernaut that was to crush Moscow, is smashed apart. After 6 months of catastrophic defeats, the Red Army's hard-fought victory is undeniable. And as the year closes, Soviet towns and villages west of the capital are being freed from their brief Nazi occupation. There will be more sweeping Soviet victories, but none will burn more brightly than this first astounding recovery from the brink of defeat. Convinced now that Germany is on the brink of collapse, Stalin demands attack after attack. Every remaining reserve is thrown into the fray as he seeks to drive the invader from Soviet territory. But it is impossible. Their superhuman effort has taken its toll, and the armies are exhausted. Dissipated by Stalin's overreaching ambition, the offensives make only trivial gains and at a dreadful cost. And by the time its attacks peter out in February, the Red Army has lost almost a million troops in the battle for Moscow. That grim statistic will be hidden from the Soviet people for half a century. The majority of Wehrmacht units may have escaped encirclement, but they could not save their equipment. Now it lies abandoned everywhere; a gigantic German scrapyard. It is a fitting sight to show British foreign minister Eden when he arrives to survey the battlefields. For neither Britain nor Stalin's new ally the United States believed that Moscow could survive the German onslaught. But if the Western Allies are amazed, this one victory has revealed to Stalin a mirage of complete triumph and he is totally committed to further attack. But he has miscalculated. The Wehrmacht is not yet beaten and a furious Hitler is planning massive new offensives. His folly will again compel the Red Army to fight in desperate defense. And so the Soviet people must struggle on. It will be a long, painful journey and many will not survive to its conclusion. RUSSIAN COSSACKS IN THE BALKANS After the 1917 Russian Revolution, the Communist Bolshevik regime brought nothing but death and misery to much of the population, especially ethnic minorities. One such oppresed group was to rise up and fight alongside the Germans. With their reputation for toughness, mobility and fearles fighting, they are well-suited for the rugged terrain of the Balkans. Allocated to clear the region of Communist partisans, they are led by charismatic German officer... General Helmuth von Pannwitz During oprations in Serbia and Croatia, there occured a number of atrocities against the civilian popuation, including mass rapes and executions. But an order by General von Panwitz dated 20 October 1943 made it absolutey clear to all under his command that any crimes of such a nature were to be punished by death. On 11 May 1945, General von Pannwitz surrender to the British Army in allied-administred Austria, after the Germans were assured they would remain in the custody of Western powers. By mid-May it was becoming clear that the Cossacks would be sent back to the Soviet Union to face execution of the Gulag prison camps. This action will forever become known as... "The Betrayal of the Cossacks" As a German national under the proection of the Geneva Conventios, General von Pannwitz was not subject to banishmet to the Soviet Union. Knowing full well the consequences, he refused to abandon his Cossacks comrades, stating: "I was with the Cossacks in good times and I will stay with them in bad times." On 26 May, he was relieved of his command and placed under arrest. The British Army then set about Cossacks onto railway trucks by beating them with baseball bats and rifle butts. The fighting lasted for several days. Eventually the British would deliver to the Red Army around 40.000 Cossacks, and with them their women and children. Many are not even Soviet citizens, and those who were not sent to the Gulag are subequently executed. General Helmuth von Pannwitz was executed in Moscow on 16 January 1947. He is to this day known by the Cossacks as... "The Last Knight of Europe" "Betrayal of the Cossacks" To be continued Part 10 Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told! THE SOVIET UNION 1942 As the spring campaigning season opens, the Red Army's victories of late 1941 seem suddenly meaningless. A hasty Soviet attack in the south against Kharkov is swallowed up by a German counteroffensive. For Soviet soldiers, this could so easily be the end. Even Stalin's son has been captured. And his image on propaganda leaflets Yakov Dzhugashvili adds credence to German claims of imminent victory. And on the brink of catastrophe, he resorts as always, to terror. Stalin's secret order number 227, issued under his signature in late July 1942. This notorious document makes any unauthorized retreat punishable by death. Not one step back. Stalin means it literally. And this unique footage shows NKVD troops putting his edict into practice. They're known as blocking units. Deployed just behind the troops, they pass instant sentence on any who disobey order 227. Enforcing the supreme commander's will without hesitation or mercy. Stalin will reject exchanging German prisoners for the return of his son, reportedly stating, "I have no son named Yakov" Yakov died in German captivity, although the circumstances are unclear. One account says he ran into an electric fence surrounding his POW camp. Another, that he was shot whilst trying to ecape. The Führer is confident now, certain that the Wehrmacht can seize the vital oil centers of Grozny and Baku. Two smaller German armies have been advancing slowly east towards the industrial city of Stalingrad. He sees a chance to cut all links between Moscow and the Caucasus. The city on the Volga becomes his new prime target. JAPAN AT WAR After the bombing of Pearl Harbour, the Japanese will now seek to rid from the region the domineering Western powers of Britain and United States. On Christmas Day 1941, they capture Hong Kong from British. The Phiippines, Burma and British Malaya all fall in quick succession. However, their greatest prize will be the taking of the British stronghold of Singpore. Vastly outnumbered, 30.000 Japanese troops force over 100.000 British, Australian and Indian soldiers to surrender. It will be one of the most humiliating defeats ever for the British Empire. Winston Churchill describe the fall of Singapore as... "The worst disaster and largest capitulation in British history." Later, historians will point the finger at Churchill himself and blunder he made in underestimating the Japanese. Hours after surrendering to the Japanese, Austrlian-born Lieutenant General Gordon Bennett and several of his officers deserted their men and absconded to Australia. He was never given a major position of command again. SINGAPORE SURRENDERS Fighting Ceased at 10 P.M. Sunday HONGKONG SURRENDERS! ANEMY ASKS FOR ARMISTICE AT 5:50 P.M. THURSDAY BRITISH ASIA FLEET SMASHED Japanese Land at Guam: Nippon Losses Insignificant In 1942, at the height of its power, the Japanese Empire ruled over an area spanning 2.847.000 squre miles. It was one of the largest maritime empires in history. JULY 1942 The Wehrmacht are at the gates of Stalingrad. An order from Stalin will prevent civilians, even women and children, from leaving the city. His reasoning is that their presence will encourage greater resisance from the city's defenders. Stalingrad seems there for the taking. But this is Stalin's city, the very symbol of his personal prestige. And that is something even women and children are expected to defend. THE BATTLE OF STALINGRAD 23 AUGUST 1942 But when the thunder finally abates, 50.000 lay dead. Now, the Wehrmacht is moving in to claim the rubble for its own. As they inch through the suburbs, German troops surely expect a rapid conquest. Instead, they are entering a savage killing ground, for a duel to the death that will rank among the most terrible in human experience. For at their approach the ruins spring to furious life. Soviet soldiers and citizens do not even contemplate surrender. A thousand desperate battles erupt on the streets. And a wild labyrinth of constantly shifting front lines swamps the city. The front line might be a house, an alley, a tram line or a wall. And every street is a minefield, virtually impassible for tanks or big guns. So that soldiers, denied air and artillery support, must fight eyeball to eyeball, lives hanging on their wits, their battle skills and their cunning. General Chuikov, in command of the 62nd Army, mounts a skillful campaign, but his outnumbered troops cannot hope to stop the Wehrmacht. And by early November it has cut a swath across Stalingrad, splitting the 62nd Army in two. In a last desperate gesture, Chuikov mounts assault after assault on the Mamayev ground, a vital patch of high ground, the very hub of the battle zone. The hill changes hands no less than eight times, as Chuikov throws everything into the fray. And from the USA's Alaskan airfields, fighter aircraft fly into Siberia to aid a Red Army almost ready to launch its counterstrike. And on the 19th of November, a huge artillery barrage by the southwest front pierces the front. And Yeryomenko's southern wing surges forward on the next day. The Wehrmacht, taken utterly by surprise, cannot stop them. And as its allies collapse on the flanks, there are no reserves to stem the resurgent Red tide. Within 3 days the Southwest Front has taken Kalach, some 80 kilometers West of Stalingrad. And on the 23rd of November, a few miles southwest of Kalach, its advanced units meet up with Yeryomenko's forces. Suddenly the German's Sixth Army and the Fourth Panzer Army, perhaps 300.000 of Hitler's finest troops, are surrounded inside Stalingrad. The hunter has been captured by his prey. An astonished Hitler summons Manstein, his troubleshooter, to Stalingrad. Two Soviet armies, the 51st and Second guards, are rushed to meet Manstein's relief force and stop it dead in its tracks. The guards pay a high price for stopping Manstein. Almost two-thirds of the army is killed or wounded. There will be no relief now for German troops in Stalingrad. The Luftwaffe tries, but the Red Army brings up extra AA batteries. And the lumbering German transports are blown out of the sky in their hundreds. Yet, like Soviet troops before them, they entertain no thought of surrender. For ordinary soldiers on both sides, this is the ghastly climax to a long, dark journey. In the heart of the cauldron, Hitler's gladiators know now that they are doomed. They evacuate a few casualties on the last plane out of Stalingrad. And with it go their last words to families, lovers, friends. But though they fight on, the bullets are running out, and the Red Army is still coming at them. Finally, after five long months, a battle that began almost by accident is over. 2 Feb 1943 Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus surrenders to the Soviets. 300.000 German, Croatian, Hungarian, Romanian and Italian soldiers, including 35.000 Soviet volunteers fighting the Communists, had been surrouded. Over 11.000 would refuse to lay down their arms at the official surrender, preferring instead a fight to the death with the Bolsheviks. By early March all pockets of resistance had been wiped out. Of those who remained, many will freeze to death on the forced marches East. Others die from disease or mistreatmet, or are worked to death in the Gulag concenration camps. Later, historians would confirm that of the 11.237 letters sent by soldiers in Stalingrad to their families, almoust all expresed a willingess to fight Communism and die for National Socialism and the Führer Adolf Hitler. Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus was held prisoner in the Soviet Union until 1952, when he settled in Dresden, East Germany. He would spend the remainder of his days defending his actions at Stalingrad. Later he would be quoted as saying... Communism was the best hope for postwar Europe. In 1955, only 6.000 of an estimated 90.000 prisoners or more would return home. Stlingrad would prove to be a turning point in the war. To be continued Part 11 Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told! From early February, Stalin orders new offensives all along the southern fronts. Though they have fought and survived the Battle of Stalingrad, their commanders can permit them no rest. Instead they must struggle on through the late winter blizzards, instruments of their supreme commander's lust for glory. The Red Army drives deep into Nazi held territories fighting exhaustion, cold, mud. Inch by inch the infantry advances. The Führer knows that if his stretched forces are to defeat the Red Army in 1943, they must attack quickly before it can recover from the losses of the winter. Hitler's strategy is simple and optimistic. In a two-pronged attack, he plans to destroy the Soviet position around Kursk. On the map, a great bulge 130 miles long and 100 miles deep at the center of the eastern front. And so now, two gigantic armies are converging. The greatest tank battle of all time is about to begin. THE BATTLE OF KURSK The great barrage of Katyusha rockets and artillery announces counteroffensives by 4 more Soviet armies sweeping around the rear of the battered German divisions. German offensive operations are halted. The Wehrmacht can only retreat. It leaves behind the mangled debris of war. Battle zones littered with charred and broken tanks, and the bodies of hundreds of thousands of men. For survivors of this savage inferno, shattered, shell-shocked, stunned by the horrors they have witnessed, there can be no joy. The Battle of Kursk 5 July 1943- 23 August 1943 Outnumbered by more that two to one, the Germans suffer casualties of around 203.000. whilst Communist losses amount to some 803.000. The Germans however failed to achieve their goal. With the US opening a new front in Italy, after the batle of Kursk, never again will Germany regain the initiative. The Germans will now fight a rearguard action in freezing weather conditions, and at the same time offer much-needed protection to refugees fleeing the rampaging Communists. "1943 the story changed and the Germans were pushed back. And in the pushback they moved us with them, and we went willingly. There was no moving at gunpoint. Had we stayed back the Communists would have taken us and executed us or shipped us to Siberia. So we very willingly retreated with the Germans. Food was getting short. The horses were getting sick. The road was getting narrow. It was extremely cold. When I think of the war, I do not think of hunger so much as of cold. It was always, always cold. And then of course once the winter came, it became harder and harder. We had to often stay overnight in strange houses. The army would confiscate houses, would put the refugees there. The army protected us to the end. The army never, ever let us down. NEVER let us down, to the very end." ¶ And the snow fell, covering the dreams and ideals. ¶ And the snow fell, freezing the blood and the wheels. ¶ And the snow fell, they had to keep warm for survival. ¶ And the snow fell, and defeated the beast's only rival. ¶ They took the old roads that Napoleon had taken before. ¶ They fought as the forces of light against the darkness in a holy war. ¶ One day they were looking around at the sun shining on the cold flowers. ¶ The next day they were freezing to death in the snow and the ice cold showers. ¶ And the snow fell, covering the dreams and ideals. ¶ And the snow fell, freezing the blood and the wheels. ¶ And the snow fell, they had to keep warm for survival. ¶ And the snow fell, and defeated the beast's only rival." PARTISANS - THE RED TEROR This secret partisan report declassified for this program complains that amongst one large partisan division. Drunkenness, robbery, beatings and rape are universal occurrences. The widespread terror wrought by the partisans was not a story the Communists wished to tell after the war. This rare archive shows a woman hanged by the partisans and displayed to the rest of the population as a warning. These film rushes, never shown to the German public during the war, reveal Soviet mutilation of German prisoners. Actions like these only served to escalate the level of the German reprisal. During our retreat we found 20 soldiers... ... murderer in the most bestial manner Their ears were cut off, their eyes gouged out, their genitals cut off Naturaly, we felt enormous rage The partisans became a growing problem for the German occupiers. If the Germans suspected a village had been used as a partisan base, then it was common practice to burn it to the ground. "And we burned the houses. On the one hand I didn't regret it too much because I knew what was is worth a Russian house? They are so primitive anyhow. Not comparable to a German house or an English house or French house, or so on. Not at all. But all in all, there's not much value in it, in such a house. They would survive. That was my feeling." In Britain, they have forged a sword, a gift to the victor of Stalingrad from King George. Earlier, in 1943, at Katyn forest near Smolensk, German occupying authorities had unearthed the mass graves of 20.000 Polish officers. International observers were invited to support Berlin's claim that the murders were carried out by the NKVD. But Stalin had reacted furiously, denying any link with the massacres. But when Allied leaders meet in Teheran, Churchill and Roosevelt back their most important ally in the face of outraged protest from exiled Poles. His sword is presented, and Stalin stands as an undisputed world leader. THE KATYN MASSACRE In March 1940, in a forest near Katyn village, eight huge pits were dug. Heavy trucks brought in people. They were Polish Army Reservists, Doctors, Engineers. The Soviets carried out massacres on a regular basis. Riga, Tartu, Lviv, Minsk. Relatives could not identify many of the corpses. Horrific torture had made them unrecognizable. The Soviet Union meanwhile had become an Allied power. The Soviet officers who pulled out fingernails, cut tongues, and perforated the skulls of their victims with nails... WERE PAID WITH WESTERN AID! The British War Crimes Act gives them immunity from prosecution in Britain, because war crimes by definition were committed only by the Germans. According to the 1991 BRITISH WAR CRIMECAST War crimes by definition were commited ONLY by the Germans. In 2012 the World Press reported their recent findings on the Katun Massacre. According to documets published Sepember 2012 by US National Archives and Records Administration, the US received coded reports in 1943 from two of its officers taken by they German captors to the Katyn Forest. Though the messeges of the US officers reached Washigton, they disappeared soon thereafter. It has long been suspected that President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill knew that Soviet leader Joseph Stalin has ordered the massacre. One thing the World Press forgot to mention... Adolf Hitler is now officially exonerated of Katyn Massacre. To be continued Part 12 Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told! On 25 July 1943, Italien leader Benito Mussolini is overthrown and imprisoned. Over the next few weeks he will be held in several top secret locations on the orders of the new Italien government. A hand-picked SS squadron, along with members of Luftwaffe, are given the task of finding and rescuing him before he can be handed over to the US. Hitler had personally interviewed three men to led squadron. The men he chose was... Captain Otto Skorzeny. With time runing out, Mussolini's whereabouts are finaly discovered at Campo Imperatore high in the Apennine Mountains of Italy. The plan is to land the commando unit there and assault it. German military expert warn Hitler of the high probability of failure and to expect an 80 % casaulty rate. The codename for the mission is Operation Oak. The 12th of September 1943, central Italy. High above Mount Gran Sasso. The most daring and spectacular raid of World War Two was completed in just 12 minutes without a single shot being fired. Captain Skorzeny greeted Mussolini with now immortal words... "Duce, the Furer has sent me to set you free!" To which Mussolini replied... "I knew that my friend would not forsake me!" On his return, Captain Skorzeny was promoted by Hitler to the rank of Major and awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves, the highest order a German military officer could obtain. Mussolini awarded him the Order of 100 Musketeers. The Allies would come to know Skorzeny as the most dangerous man in Europe. At the Nuremberg Trials, Skorzeny was accused of war crimes but acquitted. Whilst awaiting a further trial, he escaped to Spain. He then moved to Argentina but return to establish a successful construction company that would make him a multi-millionaire. Otto Skorzeny finally succumbed to cancer on 5 July 1975, aged 67 in Madrid. His ashes were later flown to Viena, Austria to be interred in the Skorzeny family plot at Döblinger Friedhof. OTTO SKORZENY The most dangerous man in Europe. 1943 OPERATION GOMORRAH On Saturday, July 24th, 792 RAF bombers readied for a night attack on Hamburg. Each loaded with tons of high explosives and incendiary bombs. It was the first of a series of attacks that would continue for an entire week, codenamed Operation Gomorrah. By 1943, the US had finally rearmed the British. Now the countries of Capitalism and Communism and those they dominate, will combine to seek the total annihilation one of most advanced civilisation the world had ever seen. Under National Socialism, Germany in a few short years had arisen from financial ruin and social degradation, to lead Europe in science, technology art and literature. It will now be surrounded. The Germany wil eventually be attacked by over 50 countries led by the Soviet Union, Britain and the US. Over Hamburg, the Americans will strategically bomb industrial plants during the day, whilst the British will purposely target civilians at night, aiming at the tighty-knit houses of the working class communities. In what was a heious and barbaric war crime of epic proportions, insigned by Churchill and RAF Commander Arthur "Bomber" Harris, over 50.000 will be incinerated in the ensuing firestorm that will become known as Germany's "Hiroshima". The Allies exepect the war to be over by Christmas, confident that the firebombing of other cities will force the Germans to turn over Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich. Yet, no matter how many bombs Allies drop on German cities, there will never be a hint of an upraising against Führer. "People were sitting there in the cellar trembling, and we saw the walls shivering. As it was, but trembling, and... those nights we can never forget in our lives. I cannot forget it ever. We asked ourselves, why are they doing this to our Führer? And we were told by everyone, because they hated the Führer. Because the Führer wanted to create a better world. Maybe Churchill and Roosevelt thought they could demoralize the German people with bombing? And make them surrender? But he reached the opposite of it." In the aftermath of the firestorm, almost a million refugees fled Hamburg and took with them stories of the most terrible horror that they'd witnessed. This caused a panic across Germany, which was unlike anything that they'd ever experienced before. In the aftermath of the Hamburg attacks, the American and British commanders remained committed to their sharply divergent strategies. Eaker continued to press precision attacks on industrial targets. Major General Ira C. Eaker Harris championed the bombing of cities. Air Chief Marshal Arthur "Bomber" Harris And the city he was focused on - Berlin. OPERATION "THUNDERCLAP" the total devastation of the center of Berlin THE RED TERROR MOVES WEST Stalin's military troikas come in the wake of the resurgent Red Army. They tour a land scorched by the departing Germans, convening kangaroo courts to purge partisan units of nationalists, anti-Communists. There is no hiding place for Nazi collaborators. The white card of betrayal hangs round their necks as they pay the price of treason. There is no pity for the young boys who flocked in innocence to join the Hitler Youth. His desperate plea for clemency will be in vain. THE FLIGHT FROM COMMUNISM As the Communists begin to recapture territories formerly occupied by the Germans, more and more refugees flee West in a desperate bid to rich safety. However, the exodus bring with it poverly, over-crowding and malnutrition. These conditions are the perfect breedig ground for what has become known over the centuries as the "war disease"... typhus. A typhus epidemic had already broken out during the summer of 1942 at the Auschwitz-Birkenau POW camp, when between 1-19 August, over 4.000 deaths were registered, at an average of 216 prisoers a day. The Germans managed to save thousands during the outbreak using pesticide Zyklon B, but the disease is so deadly that the victim's clothing had to be removed after death and burned to destroy the typhus-bearing lice. In 1943, potentially devastating epidemics in Sicily and throughout Italy were only averted by cocerted American delousing campaign using the recenty-invented compound called DDT. "Germany at that time already was besieged by 51 countries, they were struggling for their lives. And they took us in. We were all put into what looked like a great big bathroom. And what happened eventually is that they rained soap and water on us. And the reason for that was that we had to be deloused. We were so full of lice. So, when I hear about the shower heads in the Holocaust, and all of that, I know exactly what it was. That was soap and water raining down on us to delouse us. To wash us down like dogs. The same for the cutting of hair. I mean we were all shorn bald in order to stop the lice. Everybody had lice in the war, and this was just common knowledge. We considered ourselves lucky if we could ride those cattle cars. And yes, they were crammed full of people, and yes it was very difficult, you know, to travel like that. You couldn't... often you could not sit, you had to stand because they were crammed full. This is how it was in those years. People were hanging on those cattle cars. When you see those pictures, that could have been us. We were like that. The same when you see the bunk beds. My goodness, we were lucky if we had bunk beds where you could sleep at night. It meant we did not have to sleep outside in the snow." To be continued Part 13 Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told! BATTLE FOR SICILY ENDS Order Non-Resident From British Coastal Areas Today ITALY DECLERES WAR ON HITLER ALLIED ARMIES LAND IN FRANCE IN THE HAVRE-CHERBOURG AREA; GREAT INVASION IS UNDER WAY SKY TROOPS POUR INTO FRANCE On June 5th, 1944, as the greatest armada ever assembled left southern England, bound for the coast of France, history remembers it as D-Day. As the ships head towards France, the men, many of whom will die, take care of some last-minute chores. This Hitler impersonator took the men's mind off the task at hand, at least for a few moments. The time for fun ends as the coast of France comes into view. The next day on the morning of June 6th, a tremendous barrage strikes Hitler's fortifications at Normandy softening it up for the men who will soon be in the beaches. The night before, 23.000 airborne troops parachuted behind enemy lines to secure the flanks of the landing. At Gold, Juno, Sword, Utah and Omaha beaches, 130.000 Allied troops would now attack five heavily defended areas of Hitler's Atlantic wall. Both Roosevelt and Churchill, after years of providing the Soviet Union with financial and military aid, finaly send in troops to fight and die for Stalin and murderous Bolshevik regime. The ideologies of Capitalism and Communism will now combine to annihilate not only Germany and her people, but the very notion of Nacional Socialism itself. JUNE 6, 1944 DOG GREEN SECTOR OMAHA BEACH THE BETRAYAL OF POLAND The first overt signal that Stalin comes not as liberator but as conqueror is seen in late July, as General Rokossovsky takes the eastern Polish city of Lublin. Within hours of the red flag's appearance over the city, Stalin has installed a puppet Communist government: The Lublin Committee. Loud denunciations by nationalist Poles in London bring little response from the Allied corridors of power. And the London Polish government is power-less to prevent this theft of its constituency. But its cries will not long go unheeded. "Uncle" Joe Stalin is about to drop his mask and show his true face to the world. On the 29th of July, Soviet Radio issues a general plea to the Polish resistance movement, "The Home Army". The carefully worded broadcast calls for active resistance to the occupying forces. It gives the impression without ever directly saying so that the Red Army is about to storm the city. But the Red Army does not move from its positions just east of the city. And Stalin, oblivious to mounting pressure from Western leaders, grimly rejects Churchill's request for the use of Soviet airfields for RAF planes dropping supplies. Without help, the Poles are doomed. The battle for the city rages all through August and into September. But gradually, inevitably, the Polish resistance movement is decimated. Stalin bows to international criticism only in September, when an increase in Soviet aid comes too late. Last Home Army survivors surrender in early October. British Prime Minister Churchill visits Moscow, and he has come to discuss the fate of Eastern Europe. And he knows that there is little that Britain or even the United States can do to stop a man whose ambitions are backed by Red Army occupation. And so, the two leaders reach a pragmatic agreement. Jotted down on a piece of scrap paper, he concedes Soviet control over Bulgaria, Hungary and Romania, in return for Stalin's guarantee of nonintervention in Greek politics. The future of Yugoslavia is left open. And Stalin refuses even to discuss Poland. THE ENEMY WITHIN Although Allied propaganda would have us believe otherwise, Adolf Hitler was one of the most popular leader the world had ever seen. However, as in the case of Julius Caesar, the danger to the Führer would come from withim. Hitler had always doubted the loyalty of some officers from the aristocracy, and in 1944 he will be proven right. Only assassination could snap the bonds of loyalty which still bound millions to Hitler. The only plotters with access to the Führer were army officers. The officer who came closest to killing Hitler was Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg. Claus von Stauffenberg. He had his opportunity at a briefing on the 20th of July, 1944. "This was the time precisely when we were at a very... precarious military situation. And the only man who could possibly stave off disaster was Adolf Hitler. That opinion was shared by many Germans, Germans who did not belong to the Party." ERICH FELLGIEBEL EXECUTED 4 SEPTEMBER 1944 DR. CARL GOERDELER 2 FEBRUARY 1945 ERWIN VON WITZLEBEN EXECUTED 8 AUGUST 1944 At the Wolfschanze, Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia, Claus von Stauffenberg and fellow conspirators fail in their attempt on Hitler's life and the coup d'etet they wished to effect. On 21 July 1944, at 12:30 A.M., Stauffenberg is executed by firing squad. The other conspirators are rounded up - judged to be traitors - either shot by firing squad or hung. Fearful and deluded, they had tried to negotiate a separate peace treaty with Roosevelt and Churchill, in the futile hope of preventing Stalin from invading Germany.

"MY HONOUR IS MY LOYALITY" The following footage features the translated words of Léon Degrelle, one of the most famous of the Waffen SS. Born in Belgium, he joined as a private and earned all stripes from corporal to general for exceptional bravery in combat and was the recipient of the highest honours. the Ritterkreuz the Oak Leaves the Gold German Cross ... and numerous other decorations for outstanding vaour under enemy fire. One of the last to fight on the Eastern Front, he was engaged in 75 heavy hand-to-hand combat actions and was wounded on several occasions. Léon Degrelle escaped unconditional surrender by flying 1500 miles across Europe, surviving constant fire along the way and managing to crash land on the beach of San Sebastian in Spain, critically wounded. Against all odds, he survived and lived out the rest of his life in Spain where he eventually died at the age of 87. Adolf Hitler once told him, "If I had a son, I would want him to be just like you." General Léon Degrelle Young men who joined the SS were trained like no other army in the world. Military and academic instructions were intensive. But it was the physical training that was most rigorous. They practiced sports with excellence. Each of them could have performed with distinction at the Olympic Games. The extraordinary physical endurance of the SS on the Russian front, which so amazed the world, was due to their intensive training. The most striking feature of the Waffen SS was that it was composed of volunteers from some 30 different countries. What cause gathered them, and why did they volunteer their lives? Was it a German phenomenon? At the beginning, yes. In addition to Germans from Germany, northwestern Europeans, descendants of Germans from all across Europe, enlisted. Then in 1941, during the great clash with the Soviet Union, rose the European Waffen SS. It was on the front lines that the results of the SS physical training could really be noticed. An SS officer had the same rigorous training as the soldiers. A relationship of the equality and mutual respect between soldiers and officers was always present. Half of all division commanders were killed in action - half! There is not an army in the world where this happened. The SS officer always led his troops into battle. To them, Hitler was the most exceptional man ever seen. Hitler understood them, and had the remarkable idea to open the doors to the SS. The response to Hitler's offer was overwhelming. Legions from Norway, Denmark, Holland and Flanders were formed. Hitler welcomed them home. German racialism has been deliberately distorted. It was concerned with making the German race strong and healthy in every way. Hitler was not interested in having millions of degenerates. Today one finds rampant alcohol and drug addiction everywhere. Hitler cared that German families be healthy, cared that they raised healthy children for the renewal of a healthy nation. German racialism meant rediscovering the creative values of their own race, rediscovering their culture. It was a search for excellence, a noble idea. National Socialist racialism was not against the other races. It aimed at defending and improving its race, and wished that all other races did the same for themselves. That was demonstrated when the Waffen SS enlarged its rank to include 60.000 Islamic SS. The Waffen SS respected their way of life, their customs and their religious beliefs. Each Islamic SS battalion had an imam. Each company had a mullah.
