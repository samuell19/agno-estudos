I guess not every girl in the world has to wait in the hot sun for her father to get outta jail. But I didn't care about that. I just wanted us to be together again. I used to be pretty angry at him. Eddie was too. We figured he kind of dumped us, but it wasn't that simple. We've all done a lot of growing up since the bad old days. Ya see, the thing about Jack... I don't know. He kind of grows on ya. Where is he? Are you sure this is the day? I don't think this is the day. He's comin... There he is. Where? Haaa! Come on! Dad! Dad! Look at us, the perfect, happy family, right? Well, trust me. It wasn't always like this. Xm Jyou can run for cover jqyou can run for help 2 jqyou can run to your lover j but you can't ever run from yourself. J no, no, no how many times have I told you about this? I am not gonna tell you again. Shut up! I didn't do it! It wasn't my fault! Jno matter how far you go 2 jno matter how far you go 2 jno matter how long ya stay jyou can run forever 2 2 but, darlin', you will never j You're goin' on a trip. You're kiddin' me. I've got this big deal goin' down, and I'm outta here. Far away. Not alone. Yeah, New Orleans. It ain't no hop, skip and a jump. So I mean, this is real good, right? Well, well... Over all. I mean, please, Celeste, don't be tellin' me no negative stuff. I can't be havin' nothin' drainin' my energy right now. Draw another. Hai just gotta think positive. [ Male I aw, come on. He's got a couple of kids and no wife to look after them. Now don't that mean anything to you? All right, all right, all right! I'll talk to my client. Don't be usin' her for your games. Jack, if you hadn't put your kids in foster care, they would have knocked six months off your sentence. I didn't put 'em nowhere. Linda died, and the state took "em. Now I ain't happy about that, but they're doin' just fine and so am I. Now what's the deal? Well, considering everything, we did pretty well. The d.A. Says we can plea bargain it down to two years. Two years for what? I robbed drug dealers. That's right. Until you robbed an undercover cop posing as a drug dealer. Look, I'm gonna tell you somethin... I ain't goin' to jail. I am this close to doin' a deal where I'm gonna see more money than you can imagine, and I ain't lettin' nothin' mess it up, you got me? Jack, this is so easy. If we do go to trial, I call the kids in, we put them on... Leave the kids out of it, all right? The best thing I ever did for them was keepin' out of their lives and keepin' them outta mine. Okay. We see the judge in two days. Now you think you can stay outta trouble for two days? Of course. » how sweet it is to be loved by you yes, baby ooh-o0oh-0o0h » how sweet it is to be loved by you ooh, baby \ I needed the shelter of someone's arms dd and there you were 2 who is it? Kelly. Kelly who? Very funny. Just open the door. Hl... daddy. Oh, you've changed. Yeah, well, you haven't. And I'm runnin', right? And then the alarm's going off. I'm like, "Kelly, you better get over this fence, man." Do you know what they do to kids who try and get outta that place? Bigelow hall. Well, I tell you what, you oughta look at it a little more positively; Like, uh... a little bit like, um, prep school. It's really sick in there. Kids are getting hit all the time. I mean, hit really hard. You do one thing wrong, and someone's comin' after you with somethin' or slammin' you up against a wall. And lazzaro, the guy who runs the place? He never uses his hands. But he knows what's goin' on and he just lets it happen. You are outta here, little girl, 'cause this is gonna be the first place they look for you. Then get me transferred. I can't do that. Yes, you can. They have to listen to you, Jack, it's the law. Finish your pizza and you're gone. What about Eddie? Remember Eddie? What about Eddie? They're putting him in bigelow tomorrow. No, no, ma'am. He is in humboldt with that foster family. No, he's not. They're putting him in bigelow tomorrow, like a prisoner. He has never done one thing wrong except to have you as a father. God! Little girl, you back off now. Ya know, when they put him in bigelow, they'll put him in handcufes. Just get into that, why don't you? Your own little boy in handcufes. Seven years old. I thought he was five. [ Shower turning off I huh? Oh. Yo, hello? - Hey Jack, is that you? - Hey, Jerry. Did I wake you up? No, man, I been up for hours. What's the deal? Go call him. I'm in. You sure it's a quarter of a million? Just sittin' there waitin' for us. Oh, baby, okay. Well, sit tight, stay cool and I will be in New Orleans before your rice begins to boil. Okay, later. [ Hangs up phone I xm You know, we could go pick up, Eddie. I mean, then it just wouldn't be the two of us, and, I don't know, we could all have a lot of fun. » true love, baby that's what you give to me dd your love, your love \ where are we going? This is the way to bigelow. You can't do this to me, Jack. You're my father. Look, face facts. I was never your father. You understand me? I hate all this family crap. I'm gonna jump outta this car. Be my guest. - Fine! - Get in here! 2 and to me, baby you mean so much you're gonna get me killed! I don't care! Are you crazy? Look, I'm gonna tell you somethin... I am outta here. You got me? Why can't you just get me transferred? I mean, what about, Eddie? Are you even gonna talk to them? You're just gonna let 'em throw him in bigelow? Hell, yes!

You give me somethin', baby I can't forget jqyou give me your love mt stay put and don't touch... oh. Need another day in court like a hole in the head. So since his mother died, I have been very concerned about, you know, their welfare, and that's the reason we gotta do somethin' about it, at least until we can come together again as a family 'cause as far as I'm concerned there ain't nothin' more important than a man's family. You're the boy's father? Well, um, we never did blood tests, but... Mr. Charles, do you know what these are? Uh, I believe those are folders, your honor. No, these are lives, very young lives, and it's my job to make a hundred judgments a day about what would be best for each of these lives. Well, excuse me, your honor, but you know, I know a little bit about young lives, too, alright because, you know, I grew up in these places, and what I know is I can't have them running around, trying to find me all the time, and that's the reason I want them out of this bigelow place and into this... Well, bigelow happens to be one of the finest institutions - of its kind in the country. - Pardon me, your honor, not that I want to get into this here with you right now because, you know, I'm a positive kind of person, but this bigelow place, man, I'm tellin" ya; They're abusin' the kids, they got 'em runnin" away, and I'll tell ya one more thing. Well, I can hardly wait. They're handcuffing these children; I'm tellin' ya, little kids in handcuffs; They're cuffin' these kids. I'm serious. Mr. lazzaro, would you approach the bench, please? Your honor. Mr. lazzaro, would you please tell the court and Mr. Charles, is it the policy of the youth services administration to use handcuffs or any other form of restraint on children? No, of course not, your honor. They're handcuffing these kids. Mr. Charles. Their wrists are scarred. Mr. Charles, may I remind you you're in a courtroom? Yes, ma'am, I'm sorry, but this lasagna dude's lyin'. Just look at him. Your honor, Kelly Charles has been missing from our facility since last night. Mr. Charles, although he has abandoned her, may be giving her safe haven. Is this true? Your honor, all I'm tryin' to ask is this San Diego place any good? If you don't mind... Young Edward Charles, who is right now in our Van... Probably in handcuffs, no doubt. - Mr. Charles. - I am sorry, your honor. Look, can I at least see the kid? As a reward for your exemplary behavior in my courtroom? I said I was sorry. I mean, if this dude could see him, I could see him. I demand to see him now! Please. I say, get down, yeah. [ Banging on window pane I yeah. [ Door opening I Edward? This is your father. Yo, uh, Eddie. What's happenin'? You, uh, doin' all right? Dad! Yo, hey, yo, b-be cool, kid. You come to take me home? Uh, you know, um... Uh, you eatin' enough? Looks like you'd be bigger or somethin... Dad, please. You gotta take me home. I hate it in there. Alright, that's it, you're upsetting the child. Hey, hey, wait. I'm talkin' to the kid. Your honor, I cannot stand idly by while Mr. Charles agitates the child. His visit is detrimental to the child's welfare. Hey, what do you know about it... he's my kid. Correction, Mr. Charles; It's my kid. You gave him to me two years ago. Get your hands off of him, jerk. Please, you asked to see your son. Nobody, nobody messes or takes from Jack Charles, you get me? You get me? I'll seal your fate, baby. [ Footsteps approaching I that boy just messed with the wrong guy. What happened? Why'd you lie to me about the handcuffs? I am not lying. Who are you going to believe, them or me? [ Starting engine I There he is. That son of a... he lied to me. - He lied to me! - See? I told you.

You call yourself a reporter? Let me ask you somethin... Where did you get this rubbish? Did you just make this junk up? Look, do you have anything in the form of information that you'd like to tell me? Yeah, I got somethin' to say. I am tryin' to save my kids. You are not helping. So the blood is gonna be on your hands, sweetheart, but I'd like to ask you one thing; now you got kids? Aw, come off it, Mr. Charles. You abandoned those kids and you didn't visit them once, and now you're facin' 10 to 12 years in jail. And because of you, it's gonna be 50! Look, if you've got something real to say, then say it. Real? Let me ask you somethin... What is real to you? I have been tryin' to bust this foster care racket for over a year now, but it's against the law for a journalist to talk to a minor, so here's somethin' real. Ask your daughter if she's ever taken a field trip to yosemite national park. And then ask her how many times a week she ate meat. W-what are you talkin' about? You tryin' to give me some kind of runaround? Just get me some details, all right? That's how you get a story like this: You follow the money. Jack? Jack? Are you listening to me, Jack? Jack! Go, go, let's get over here, get over here. Hurry up, get over here, fast, fast. - What's goin' on? - Look behind you. Now you guys stay here, don't move. I'll be back. I'm gonna get a car. The sooner we do this, the sooner you people can go, so, please, everybody out. How is he gonna get a car with all those cops there? I don't know. It's your stupid idea to come here in the first place. Leave me alone. We have five units on scene right here. [ Starting engine I Dad! Psst! Yo! - Jack! - Dad! - Shut up! - But you're alive. Come on, let's go. Let's party. Come on. [ Murmuring I those suckers are so stupid. I hate foreign cars. Did you see that sucker? Dra-kaboom! What? What is the crybaby crap? He thought you were dead, okay? Dead? Dead? It was the coolest thing I ever saw in my life. Did you see it? It was like Schwarzenegger. It was like TV. It was amazing. Yeah, it was real great. Now instead of a couple cops after us, there are probably gonna be a hundred. You guys are wet blankets. I can't take this. I gotta be around somethin' more positive. This is Andrew's unit five, we're in pursuit. We'll notify on contact. Unit five out. - Please, just leave me alone. - Shh! Hey, hey, hey. You know, I looked for you last night. Don't you disappoint me again, sweetheart. Macdougall? Mr. macdougall? May I have a word with you? What's up, chief? I got a call from "the L.A. post." Jack Charles phoned in. And? This woman reporter has been trying to smear our facility for a year; She's totally irresponsible. Sometimes I just don't understand what makes people so vindictive. You know, I'd love to say to her, "miss Mercer, "if you think you can do a better job with these children you are welcome to take several of them home with you." Well, in the meantime, Mr. macdougall, uh, just try to keep everything ship-shape around here. Did you love mom? Dad, what are we gonna do past flagstafe? Well, uh, they'll figure Mexico, but we're gonna go east and fool 'em all. So did you? [ Sighs I what are you tryin' to do, make conversation? Forget it. We can take the 180 right into Texas, okay? Yep. So, Kelly, when you were at bigelow, did, um, you ever go to yosemite national park? What are you talking about? I don't know. Steak, what about steak? You ever eat a steak? You'll talk about anything except what I wanna talk about, won't you? - Just answer me. - We never went anywhere. I don't wanna go to yosemite national park anyway. The only time I ever saw a steak was when I had to clean up the custodians' dining room, okay, happy? Now answer my question. Did you love her? She was a good-lookin' woman. We'd walk down the streets of Reno and every head would turn to look at her. She was a tough cookie, though. And legs, girlfriend. She had legs up to her chin. Actually, you look a lot like her. Well, who could tell, though, with those dumb-lookin' high-water pants and army boots. Problem was her legs were a little too long. She sure liked the good life. Good morning, I'm Chad Carter, and here's what's happening. Here's Tony mosdy with news 91. Stop it. The search for L.A. mobster Jack Charles continues. Oh, not again. The search has widened to six states and personnel from over 30 local police forces as well as the e.B.I. On the weather front, morning... The f.B.1.? Cool! The whole world's looking for us. Gangster, mobster, the way these squirrel-peckered, numb nuts use the damn english language makes me wanna puke. I gotta pull in and make a call. Hey, dad, could you grab me somethin' to eat? I'm starving! Girlfriend, you ain't doin" Jack about gettin' 'em off my trail. You're not exactly doin' Jack about doin' anything to help me either. Okay, okay, she ain't never been to no yosemite national park, and she ain't never ate a steak. Well, now, isn't that interesting? I've got reimbursement sheets, and lazzaro's charged the state for two trips to yosemite this past year, and he was given money for steak dinners on Tuesdays and Saturdays for the past three years; That's another $30,000. So now, are you gonna change your stories and get 'em off my butt or what? He's been in there a long time. He probably snuck out the back. Cut it out, Kelly. He's our dad. He took us. He didn't take us. We took him. I don't care. I love him. You don't know what love is. You'd love a dog if it licked your hand. So? So. - Who's that? - A friend in New Orleans. Ooh! Kelly's got a boyfriend. You better not say anything, and you better not tell him I know he's goin' to New Orleans, okay? I told you about the trips and the meat, right? That is the information that you really needed to know! So, you got it, go with it. Jack, was your daughter... Abused in bigelow hall? Oh, yeah. Absolutely. You're her father. You can ask her that. What do you know about bein' a father in today's world? You're a... y-y-you're, you're a scrawny little Irish chick who pushes pencils and lives alone and eats take-out and has a cat named ginger. How'd you know that? Y-y-you live on streets, you pick shit up. One thing: I'm allergic to cats. Hey, I know, I know, when I rescued these little shi... When I rescued my kids, I rescued a girl named Dolores. You talk to her, she'll back up everything I'm saying. Dolores what? How should I know? You're the... Dolores. You're the reporter. Find it!

Now... let's do a little negotiatin'. Here, wrap these around you. Whoa, how much did these cost? Nothing. - He robbed the guy. - No, I didn't! Kelly, just give him a break.

I heard you say it back in L.A., okay? It doesn't make one bit of difference 'cause as soon as we get there you're going back into foster. Look, let's not fight, okay? I'm sorry. Who's fightin'? Who's fightin'? What kind of a way is that to talk? He is a human being. - He is your son. - Oh, shut up! No, you shut up! You're mad at me, not him. Kelly, look out!

[ Car sputtering I Jack, it won't start. Forget it. We're outta here. Let's jam. What is happenin' to my luck? I'm sick of this. Stupid kids. Where is Dolores, Mrs. Carter? It's very important that I speak with her. Did she ever speak to you about bigelow hall? No. They took her. Where? I don't know. You are her aunt, aren't you, Mrs. Carter? I'm not her aunt. She liked to call me that, you know, but... You see, Dolores was my foster child years ago. And then, they took her away from me. How come they did that? Didn't you try to adopt her? Yes, I did. I most certainly did. But it's hard with kids in foster. You know how it is. I mean, they wanna keep them. Once they get their hands on them, they wanna keep them forever. It's all... it's all money to those people. It's all money. Car 7252 to dispatch. We found the car stolen by the kidnapper from California, over. This is, like, the most fun I've ever had. Yeah, yeah. I thought this was Texas, the land of wide open spaces. Oh, lord. I wish I knew where I was. Wow! Cool. Look at that. I ain't got time for this. I got a day and a half, and we ain't stoppin' to breathe. Hurry up. Stay here. One of life's sweet moments: When you're just about to take what you want. In the car. I'm going in that cave. You ain't... get in the car or I'll kill you, kid. The third largest in America. I'm going. Look, look! My life is runnin" away from me before my eyes like a cockroach up the wall and you wanna go in a cave? Get in the... Out of the car. Out of the car now, out of the car now. Go that way. Go, go, go! The more we know about caves, the more we can tell about geological history. And also, the more we see what nature has done and the time involved, the smaller we seem. Awesome, dad. Can we live here? Oh, shut up. Silt mud and shale on the bottom of the sea. The police are here and they want all the people back upstairs. Folks, I'm sorry. We gotta cut it short today. The police want us upstairs. Okay. Come on, folks, let's move it out. Come on out, folks. Leave very carefully and watch your step. Watch your step, folks. Very good, folks. Watch your step.

To the good life. To the good life. Whatever that means. Hey, dad, tug it with me. No way. Somebody made that up. Come on, dad, please? Um-mm. Come on, please, just tug it with me? Oh, I knew it, I knew it. Yes, I won! I can't get a break. Doesn't mean anything. Forget it, keep eatin'. I remember the last time we had Thanksgiving. No, you don't. You were two years old. Yes, I do. You know what? I remember one Thanksgiving... Well, there was a Turkey, it had to be Thanksgiving. Um, Rita and my old man were fightin' again, as usual, this time about the Turkey not bein' ready. Rita couldn't cook anyway 'cause she was drunk on her behind. So my old man slammed her against the wall and he says, "I'm going out to get take-out chicken." And I know. Right then, I knew: He's gone, he ain't never coming back. I decided to play hero. I run out the house, run around the house, jump in the trunk and decide to wait for him 'cause I'm gonna bust him when he tries to split. So, I'm waitin' and nobody comes. Waitin'. I'm waitin" and waitin' and still nobody comes. I wound up havin' to stay in that trunk all night long. I peed all over myself and I had to wait until the cops came and found me the next morning. That's sorta depressing. No, it ain't depressing. Everything that's ever happened to me in my life has taught me something. You just gotta remember to think positive. You could use a little of that. Eddie, go up and check and make sure we're headed east. Okay. Yo-yo-yo-yo, wait, sit down. Now what? Um... You know that bigelow place you were in? Did anybody, you know, ever touch you? Touch me? Why would I ever tell you something like that? Why don't you just stop asking me questions! Okay, just stop pretending you're my father! Yo, yo, yo! I told you somethin... You-you're drunk. I am not drunk. Anyway, I didn't wanna know. It was this reporter that... Look, no one ever touched me, okay? No one touches me! They wouldn't dare. No one. Kathleen Mercer. Yo, it's me. Jack, they caught Dolores and put her back in bigelow. I'm gonna try to get by to see her, but they probably won't let me. Listen, I think they abused my daughter in there, okay? Jack, what would you say if I asked you to come back here, bring yourself, bring your kids and tell your story. - You're crazy. - No, Jack, really. I think I can cut a deal. A deal? Deal? I'll tell you about my last deal somebody tried to make for me. I was lookin' at hard time. Well, this deal is gonna be different, okay? Hey, hey, hey, what was I doin'? I was robbing drug dealers. What's he doing? [ Truck engine starts I he's still talking on the phone. Well, make him hurry up. Make the guy stop. Make him stop. Dad! Dad! Jack? I'm comin'! Hang on! Dad, come on! You can do it, I know you can. Hurry up, come on! Come on! Hurry up! He stopped running. Not even Jack can catch a car, Eddie. Uh, who owns the truck with the antlers on it? I'm telling you, man, this is the greatest watch. Are these diamonds real? Yeah. It's just a great watch, man. Why do you paint yourself like that? It's just to get women. They're good luck symbols. My mother does 'em. All right, when we get up here, I want you to jam on his tail and stay right behind him so he don't see you, okay? I just gotta tell ya, you look real familiar to me. I'm real good with faces. I mean, I know that I don't know you, but I know you, you know what I mean? Do you do television or something? No. You remind me of a guy I know on television. - Well, I don't know him... - There he is, there he is. Go, go, move it! Get up behind him! Don't let him see you, go! I got it! Got it! Get behind him and stay behind him. Okay, closer. Closer. - Okay, I got it I got it. - Easy, easy. What do you got on this boat anyway? My kids are on that boat. Easy, easy. Wait a minute.

Ha-ha! I'm back. Dad! How could you do that to us? You're just blabbin' away on the phone. Are you crazy? I'm gonna tell you something. I lived through a bar full of rednecks. I jump off a truck onto a boat, I risk my life. Let me ask you somethin', are you perfect? You never miss a busted appointment or nothin'? Look at your son, just look at what you're doing to him. What am I doin' to him? I ain't even talked to the kid. I ain't been nice to him. You're making him fall in love with you. It isn't fair, Jack. You're gonna break his heart. Stop it! You're gonna make him go away again! Where are we? Let me see your map. Where are we? We're right there. This is takin' a lot longer than I planned. Well, at least we're on the right road and it feels like my luck is back. You really believe in that luck junk, don't ya, Jack? In my business, you better believe in somethin', sweetheart. I believe in luck. Only because he does. No, I've always believed in luck. Ever since I was a kid. I believe in luck and I believe in mom. You believe in mom? You believe in a dead woman? Yo, back off. That's what believing is. If it's starin' you right in the face, you ain't gonna believe in it. It's about believin' in the stuff you can't see that you gotta believe in. It was a good idea gettin' that map. So, can I ask you somethin'? What? Why ain't you ever called me dad? [ Dishes crashing I what's happening? Son-of-a-bitch just launched us. Give me a hand.

For once in your life why don't you do something for somebody else and come back here - and do something about this? - Something about what? Lazzaro and this whole foster care system. That's your job, girlfriend. Well, I can't do it alone, Jack. I need someone to come forward. Look, get somebody else. If I come back, it's gonna be ten years plus whatever else I've racked up on this little trip. - I need you, Jack. - Yeah, I can see it now. "Stickup man turns self in to expose foster care system." Yeah, something like that. What's in it for me? Tell me this. I don't have a life like you with medical and pension plans. What's in it for me? Please tell me. All right, look, they're offering you a reduced sentence. Two years and you're out. Good behavior, 18 months. Get out of town, girlfriend. Jack, I know you think the system is totally... What do you know about the system? You live in an insulated, middle-class, little dreamworld. You write about the system, I live the system, sweetheart.

Back at the bigs, you were my best friend. You were the best friend I ever had. Yeah. That was pretty weird there, wasn't it? I saw your picture in the paper, you know? You're in a lot of trouble. You know, when my dad told me that he was coming to New Orleans, I made him take me with him. I really wanted to see you. Kelly, look... I was only trying to be nice to you.

Ladies and gentlemen, I wanna assure you that nothing of that sort has ever happened. Kelly Charles was a runaway. Her reason for running away, it's come to our attention, is that she developed an obsession for a young summer intern... Geez, will you come on? This lazzaro has been doing his razzle-dazzle... I got this lazzaro dude's number, okay? - No, no, this is no joke, Jack. - Let me ask you somethin', how many deals have you made for me and how many worked? Aw, don't bring it up. Now we've been working our chops off for this! This is a dumb idea. - This is not a dumb idea. - Jack, you're late! Kathleen Mercer, the world-famous Jack Charles. You're not Irish. So I lied. What else did you lie about? Is this deal going down or what? Absolutely, Jack. As long as you tell the truth, the plain simple truth. I always tell the truth. Let's do it girlfriend. You better tell the truth. Just keep it straight, Jack. [ Lazzaro I you see, this whole thing finds its origins in the fantasies of a disturbed child, the arrogance of a career criminal and a media circus ringmastered by an irresponsible reporter. [ Door thumps open I Jack, she's right. Just tell 'em the truth, huh. Don't worry about it, man. Relax, I got it down. So there I was trying to get my life straight, trying to do the right thing and put my kids someplace decent. You know, but I always was thinkin' of the kids. I never thought about anything else. And then they're ripped from my arms. So, naturally, like any good father, I was upset. And then, like magic, they come back into my life, and we're forced to try to cram years into a few days, but we managed. We got to go to Vegas, we got to go to hoover dam, the desert, some caves, the mighty Mississippi... You've had your difficulties with the law, isn't that right, Mr. Charles? Uh, madam chairman, if I may... You may not. Yo, yo, sit down, man. I got it under control. I'm cool. Uh, your hon... uh, madam, at least one of those convictions was highly questionable. What about them? What did they do wrong? Where's their crime? The man kidnapped his children. Doesn't that mean anything to anyone here? You know, now look, I don't know anything about the other homes for kids around this city, but I do know that in bigelow hall these kids are bein' hurt. [ Lazzaro I madam chairman, bigelow is not on trial here. Mr. lazzaro, please. Maybe bigelow hall should be on trial here. Madam chairman, I've got evidence. [ Lazzaro I what evidence? Gleaned from disturbed children? Look, these kids did not hurt anybody and you had 'em locked up like criminals! Where's the justice in that? I gotta ask you that. I mean, handcuffing 'em, abusing 'em, making money off 'em... There were no handcuffs. There was no abuse. What about Dolores and her baby? What about Eddie? Have you forgotten about your friend Travis? Whatever might have happened with my staff, happened without my consent and knowledge. That is a lie! What about me? You were there. You saw it. You just walked away. You just walked away. May I ask you something, sir? What did she do that was so wrong? Tell me, please. Bein' a kid is not a crime, man. You can't get punished for just bein' little. And she could... She can be sassy. Kids think they know everything, but they don't. And... It's scary because you gotta watch 'em, man. You gotta... You gotta talk to 'em. Y-you gotta raise 'em. You can't just throw 'em away because if you do, this is what you get. Oh, please. The man has no idea how to raise children. Maybe I wasn't worth beans as a father and actually, maybe I probably was the worst father that ever hit the planet. And I didn't know my kids. And I didn't never do nothin' for 'em. And maybe I-don't know, maybe I mean... Maybe I should stop the excuses, huh? It all comes down to this... I didn't know you. I didn't know I had a son. I didn't know I had a daughter. But now I do. Now I do. I just... I just wish that I could be your father. This is outrageous! He is not their father! According to transfer form 33-11, these children still belong to me. - Leave me alone! - Could we have some order here? Get your hands off my children now! Could we please have some order here! You touch my kids again, I'll kill you... sorry. I pray that when they put you away, they put you where I am 'cause we're gonna dance. [ Door closes I I love you, Kelly. I love you too, daddy. Ahh. Be good to yourself, okay? Sure. Come here, little fella. Give me a hug. I love you, dad. I love you too. Hey, hey, hey, think of it this way: I'll get to make the license plates for your first car.
