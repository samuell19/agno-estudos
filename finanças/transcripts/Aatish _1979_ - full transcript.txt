Count it. - You have counted it, right Mr. Malhotra? - Yes, sir. Then what's the need for me to count it? Thank you, sir. Why did you take the trouble to come so far? You should've sent somebody else. This is not the only work I had, I had two more appointments in the city. Income tax case and I had to meet the lawyer too. Forgive me sir, at this age you do more work than needed. That is why I am not old yet, Mr. Khan. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Sir, a jeep is following us. Driver, drive the car faster. Fast! I have given him injections for sleep. Till tomorrow morning he will be alright. The wound isn't very deep. He needs rest for 2-3 days. There is no need to be afraid. Well, thank God. - Okay Mr. Rai, good night. - Good night. Even now, in this world there are people.. Who risk their lives in saving other's lives. You are right, Shobha. Ashu, Raju go to sleep, children. It's very late. Come on. - Good morning, mister.. - Anand. - Thank you, mister... - Rajesh Kumar. People call me as Raju. I am Mr. Rai's son. And this is my sister. This is my sister, Asha. People call her as Ashu. A name is always said lovingly. What do you say, Raju? What do you say, Ashu? - So, Anand. How are you now? - I am alright. - What are you doing, ma'am? - You have saved my husband, son. I can't forget your favour throughout my life. May God make give my long age to you too. Sir has come. There is going to be a problem today as well. - Mother. - Rakesh? Today you have remembered your mother. Whenever I need money, mother, I am reminded of you. Not much. I just need Rs. 5000. Son, more than money I have the wealth of a mother's love. Sometimes come around to take your mother's blessings. The blessings that I get through money, mother.. They are completely unique. Hurry up, mother. I have very less time. Please. Brother, why did you leave home? You don't even come to meet us? Brother, you will have to wait here today. You will have to hear my story and sister's song. I don't have time for such rubbish. Just last week you took Rs. 10000. - Have they been spent fully? - My great mother! I haven't come to give an account. He hasn't come to give an account. He has come to take the account - of your love of a mother and my patience. - Daddy! Until when will you pay this tax for being a mother? You don't need to come between a mother and son. I do! I can't see my hard earned money be wasted anymore. Why? Doesn't your son have a right your hard earned money? You had a right! You have lost it due to your actions. - I have done everything for you. - You have done a father's duty. I did much more than that. It was my mistake. I handed my whole business to you. But there you didn't do anything other than dishonesty and squandering. I thought that you would carry our old age's burden. But it is regretful. Today, all the burden of your loose-handedness and ill-fame.. Has to be carried by me. My name comes with your name. And my neck is bent due to shame. I haven't come here to listen to this nonsense. I want money! I am paying you a liability of being your father Rs. 5000 every month. This Rs. 5000 is like alms to me. And alms can never fill one's stomach. Is that why you are filling your stomach these days by stealing? - Stealing? - Yes, stealing. Yesterday you forged my signatures and had a cheque of Rs. 10000 cashed. If I wanted to, I would have handed you to the police. If a father sits like a snake on wealth that is what a son will have to do! Stupid! Get out of here! I said get out! Rakesh, don't break your daddy's heart and go. - Ask for forgiveness, son. - No mother! Brother, you want money, right? Take this. Why are you missing your shots today, Mr. Rai? A man misses many things in his life, Mr. Mathur. - Greetings, Mr. Rai. - Greetings. Come in. Tell me, what is it? This time you came to the club after a long time. Meet him, my son Javed. And he is one of my specially known men. - Greetings, uncle. - Bless you, son. Tell me, what are you doing? - I am an engineer. - He is an engineer. But for me he has become a military officer. - What do you mean? - Now I have 6 months to be retired. But he has had me retired early. Eat on time, sleep on time, get up on time. You may say that he has made me a useless being. He won't let me do any work. Mr. Khan, you should be proud of your son. May God give such a child to everyone. Take this. A bet of Rs. 200. Rs. 200. Rs. 400. - Rs. 400. - Rs. 800. - Show. - Is that all? - A show so early? - You can play on. You're lucky because your father has just died. And it's my bad luck that my father is still alive. Napoleon Bonaparte was once giving a speech. My brave soldiers! The courage that you showed in the battlefield.. I can't forget it. But at this time.. Anyone of you may come forward and show me some dare.. Which would be awed by this world. I will give him the best award of this world. One of those soldiers, whose one hand was chopped off.. Came forward and cut his second hand too. Tell me, did Napoleon give him a reward or not? - Tell me quickly. - He did. You are wrong. - He didn't. - That is wrong too. He gave it and took it back. This is even more wrong. What is right then? My Raja, if that soldier had already had one hand cut.. How can he cut his second hand? - Mr. Rai. - Daddy has come. Daddy, daddy. Uncle made so many puzzles today! We had a lot of fun. Thank you, Anand. Gopal, set food on the table quickly. Come on, daddy. Son, you people eat. Today I am not hungry. Looks like you're feeling unwell today. You don't even have medicine properly. Take this. It's an old illness, Shobha. It can't be cured by medicine too. I stayed with you people for just two days. But your love will always be in my heart. Alright, I'll leave now. Anand, we can't ever repay you favour. Take this. What is this, Mr. Rai? We poor people only have humanity. If we sell that too, how will we live? Uncle, give us your address. Whenever we are in a good mood.. We will come to your home and listen to puzzles. I don't have an address. I am here today and somewhere else tomorrow. - Why? Don't you have parents or siblings? - I don't have anyone. - I am alone in this world. - Alone? - Then stay here. - Raju is right, Anand. No, Ashu. I need to go. - Tomorrow I have an interview. - Interview? I don't want to miss it under any circumstances. - I have been unemployed for a long time. - How far have you been educated? B. A. Anand, I want to give you good news. - Good news? - Yes. You have passed an interview. - What? - You have got a job. - A job? - Yes. From today, you will work in my office. But Mr. Rai, you... Look Anand, don't think that I am doing you a favour. Our company needs an honest man like you. - What do you say, Shobha? - Yes, Anand. Now we will listen to puzzles every day. Anand, go to the factory and meet Diwan Chotelal. Yes. Thank you so much. Do you know due to whom you get your food? Due to whom you have a job? Ask me. Due to whom? Diwan Chotelal, son of Diwan Khotelal. Son of Diwan Motelal. If I want to, I can fire everyone in a minute. And hire you back in the next minute. Go and do your work! Don't waste my valuable time! Go! - Why are you standing here? Go! - Well... I haven't seen him here before. So, who are you? - Whom do you want to meet? - Mr. Diwan Chotelal. Diwan Chotelal doesn't meet an ordinary person. If you want to meet someone, go and meet Mr. Rai. He has sent me here. - Mr. Rai has sent you? For what? - A job. A job and a girl are received due to luck, boy. Not on Mr. Rai's saying. How would Mr. Rai know what goes on in this company? He just sends anyone. Sometimes for money and sometimes for a job. A leaf can move without breeze. But without my order not even one man can move from here. Now I am going to give Mr. Rai an order that he can't give me any order. - At least I can request you, sir. - Certainly. - Sir you? - Sorry, Mr. Diwan Chotelal. Without your permission, I have given Anand the job of chief supervisor. You gave it to him? You did? Then he must be a useful man. And a useful man must get a job. - So, go and explain the work to Anand. - Very well, sir. Come with me. - There was a very little work... - Please come. "I am a girl in a boy's disguise."

Is this is your father's garden? You thought that no one will see you. You could steal the apples and flee. - I am the supervisor of this place. - Supervisor? Yes. That means inspector. While an inspector is present, no single grain can be stolen. I made a mistake. Forgive me. Take these. Take them? Now you will have to pay. You will have to labour in this hill station's police station. You will be in a bad state. Bad state? Between you and me. Keep this. What is this? Rs. 5? Here, take Rs. 5 more. But let me go, ma'am. Now that's more like it. Between you and me, do you want more stuff? Yes. Come with me. - Where? - Come on. Here. - How much can you give me? - At this time I can give you 2 crates. It's the fruit that has just been taken off the tree. Completely fresh. - You will get it for 100 in the market. - Let's adjust 50 for 100. You are great! - Take cash and have fun. - Come. Take these 2 crates. Hey! What are you doing? That what an honest person does with a dishonest one. Madho! Hariya! Vimla! He was going to pay me a bribe. I have caught a thief. The whole nation is ruined due to these.. Ruffians who pay bribes. - Go quickly and call uncle Diwan. - Alright, Shanno. He stole fruits and then tried to bribe me. - A bribe? You are bribing me? - O God! It's not a bribe. It is a child's dessert, Diwan. Then say so. Mr. Diwan, Shanno has caught a thief. - He was giving her a bribe. - A bribe? - Oh God! - I can forgive a hundred murders.. But not a bribe. Come with me. Dishonest man! Where is that dishonest man who was bribing the inspector? So, dishonest man... I mean, gentleman. Shanno, what have you done? This is our chief-supervisor. Your officer. It isn't written on his head. And I was doing my duty. I too was doing my duty. It's not written on your head that you are honest. So, you were testing me? And you were testing me. I am very happy that you two are honest. - Take your money back. - Keep it with you. - What? - Not as a bribe, as a reward. Forgive me, sir. Shanno doesn't desire a reward but what she desires is honour. Take this. Good day. - This girl has a character. - Character? Mr. Anand, character is found in our company's every director.. Every contractor and even in every tractor. Honesty is our company's trade mark. There are many people who give bribes. But you won't find even one here who takes bribes. Thank you. That's the limit! The train of high prices is going at full speed. I don't know when it will stop. Mother, here are the supplies for the whole month. And here is my salary for the whole month. And here are your medicines. Eat the tablets before eating food and medicine after eating lunch. Did you understand? - Child. - Yes, mother. This is your age to play. You have to carry the burden of the whole house. - I have... - Only one worry. To get you married and send you to your home. Isn't that it? Look, mother. I'll get married as you tell me to. But I will never go to another home. Your son-in-law will have to come to this home.. Through a marriage procession instead of me. Crazy girl, does that ever happen? It doesn't, but that's how it will be. Because I can't leave you and you can't leave me. And that man won't be able to leave us both. Hey! Get me a beer. Move aside... - Hey! Stop the vehicle! - Hey, move! Move your car behind. - You move your car behind. - I won't. Is it so? I'll move it. Hey! I say stop it! What are you doing? I said, you bloody fool stop it! What is this insolence? You injured this man due to negligence. You crushed his sheep. And you are moving away as if nothing has happened. Why are you having a problem? - Who is he for you? - My relative. What relation does he share with you? Relation of humanity. - You don't have any value for it. - Oh hell with it! Here is the price. That is compensation for his loss of goods. Now who will pay the price for his this condition? What do you mean? Sir, you will have to ask forgiveness from this man. Don't you know who I am? I know you very well. But sir, I am helpless. You will have to say sorry. What do you say, sir? Didn't I say the right thing? You tinny servant! Do you dare you raise your head before the inspector? Disrespectful man! You hit my man! I apologize to you for that. - But you have t say sorry to him. - Leave my hand! I don't leave someone's hand after I have caught it. I'll have your hands freed, sir. But you will have to ask for forgiveness. - Sorry. - Not like that. Like this. Leave my hand. Forgive me. Wow! That was fun. Today a man dared to fight with him. Shake hands. Sir, you had just said that.. You don't leave anyone's hands on getting hold of it. Sir, aren't you ashamed to tease a young girl in broad daylight? Girl, aren't you ashamed to tease a young boy in broad daylight? What? Have you ever heard.. That a young girl teases a young man? You are the ones who do such mischief. And this is the proof for it which you used to hit me. - And the one you used to hit me? - Don't try to lie. Your truth has come out. You have thrown a net knowingly. - Because you have fallen in love with me. - Love? This is all wrong, completely false. This is the truth. I am looking at everything. Your way has changed. Your voice has changed. - Your way of looking has changed. - Shanno! Sir, have you come here for work or romance? I can't bear this. I'll go right now and complain to the owner right now. - Don't do that. - I will do so. - I'll lose my job. - What should I do then? You should get punishment for your doing. Look, Shanno. Forgive me. I swear to you.. Whatever you have to say, say it before the owner. - Now he will make your decision. - Anand, Shanno! What is it? What happened? What decision do you want me to take? Sir, Anand has... What has he done? He has done a lot. Did Anand make a mistake? He made a big mistake. Actually... I was telling him that.. Half the goods should go today and the other half tomorrow. But he says that half goods should go tomorrow and the other half today. What? One half of the goods today and the other half tomorrow. Half of the goods tomorrow and the other half today. I have understood it. I understand. Now listen, I have decided.. You two will work together and take care of each other. You're right, sir. Thank you, sir. So, inspector, you were going to get me fired. - Why didn't you complain about me? - I felt pity on you. Why don't you say that you love me? - Love? - Yes. Your truth has come out. I can see everything. Your way has changed. Your voice has changed. Your way of looking has changed. This means that you have fallen in love with me. But I don't love you. I will love a girl who has veil on her head. She should have vermillion on her head. She must have bangles on her hands. She should have shyness in her eyes. She must be blushing and be under control. She should walk slowly.. And it should appear like there is an anklet ringing far away. But you don't have all this. 'I will love a girl...' - '...who has veil on her head.' 'She should have vermillion on her head. She must have bangles on her hands.' 'She should have shyness in her eyes.' 'She must be blushing and be under control. She should walk slowly..' '..and it should appear like there is an anklet ringing far away.' "I was good but incomplete. I got someone who was better than me." "I was good but incomplete. I got someone who was better than me." "I have become his slave." "I have become his slave." "Salutations." "Salutations." "At least tell me when you will come accompanied by a marriage procession?" "When will you make your slave your wife?" "At least tell me when you will come accompanied by a marriage procession?" "When will you make your slave your wife?" "King of my heart, I am very happy to have met you." "King of my heart, I am very happy to have met you." "Come closer and make an agreement." "Come closer and make an agreement." "Salutations." "Salutations." "Very few people in this world are like you." "There are many small personalities like me." "Very few people in this world are like you." "There are many small personalities like me." "Join two cards and break the limits of this age." "Join two cards and break the limits of this age."

"I have become his slave." "I have become his slave." "Salutations." "Salutations." Anand, I just remembered this. - Will 10000 crates be ready till tomorrow for export? - Yes. Good. Alright, I shall leave. Sir! Denu, what happened to you? My goat went to Mr. Girdhari's garden. I went to take that goat, his men beat me and made me into such a state.. And they also took away my goat. - Go take him to a doctor quickly. Go! - Alright, sir. Girdhari's actions have disturbed me greatly. - I don't know what to do. - Who is Girdhari? A rich ruffian! He has illegally captured our gardens. He isn't afraid of the police or court. Since the day I took him to court.. He has made our workers' living miserable. I am frustrated, I am planning to withdraw the complaint. No, not complaint we will teach him a fitting lesson. Come, Mr. Diwan. How did you come by? I haven't come, I have been brought. He has come to meet you. - Oh! - He's our chief supervisor. - Anand. - I am very happy to meet you. My name is Girdhari. Tell me, what can I do for you? I have come in relation to the garden. I request you, in presence of friendship.. If this enmity would be finished, it would be good. That is what I want too. The fights, problems, court, are not for respectful people like us. Take this agreement and sign it then. Oh! Girdhari, this humour isn't good. You will have to sign. On what? On this. Oh! Mr. Girdhari, didn't you hear? This humour isn't good. You will have to sign. Wait! A rat has attacked a tiger. I appreciate your courage. Shake hands. Wait. We are both tired. I have a tablet that ceases tiredness. Have it, I'll have it too. Here. We will both enjoy it. You have one, I'll have another. - Come here! - What are you doing? - Drink water. - I won't drink this water. In my rule, tigers and Denu's goats drink water from the same source. - Drink. - Make some other papers.. I'll make a signature wherever you tell me to. - Go on, I'll wait for you. - 'Waiting' is not in my dictionary. Here! Sign it! Take this pen! Wow! Anand has done a great job. I couldn't do this for many years.. The court couldn't do this, he did it in hours. Did Anand do it? It's my bad fate. It was the spices that did the work, but daughter-in-law got credit for it. Sir, I thought that there is justice in your home.. But today.. I have realised that there is not justice in your home but sheer injustice. - What do you mean? - Chotelal's big mouth never emits lies. It's a secret sir, don't let it out in the open. If I wouldn't be there today, Anand would not have returned alive. When Girdharilal had him cornered from all sides.. I broke the barrier and I screamed loudly, 'Girdhari'.. Girdhari was scared and looked around.. He said, 'who are you?' I told him, 'coward, if you want to see me, look downward..' he looked at me with a bent neck, I saw him with my neck upward.. And then Girdhari used his shaking hands.. And shaking pen to sign on a shaking paper. Sir, tell me what happened to Anand? He was in a bad state. He was scared and hid in a box. - He is still hiding. - Did you see, sir? It's not me, the whole world... Anand, how are you? Are you okay? - Are you hurt? - Until you are here, how can I be hurt? Anand, you rid us from a big problem. For this, you are given a promotion. From today, you are the manager of our firm. - Thank you, sir. Thank you very much. - Bless you. Thank me. I requested for you to be promoted. Sir, it has been so many years since you started working here.. Why haven't you been promoted? Servants get promoted, not owners. Hello? Anand, it's your telephone. - Hello? - A manager from being a supervisor! Wow! On this promotion accept Girdhari's congratulations.. But don't forget that I too have a part in your success. What do you want to say? We will get many opportunities to say and listen. All I know is that Mr. Rai will pay for this. Understand another thing. God, today is Rakesh's birthday. Every mother is happy on her son's birthday.. But I am very sad. My son has lost his way. I pray to you, God.. Show my son the right way, show my son the right way. Sister, keep this tie from me. Ma'am, did you call me? Gopal, do you know that brother Rakesh has his birthday today? Yes, how could I forget that? Take this packet and hand it over only to brother. - Don't give it to anyone else. - Alright. - Gopal, where are you going? - To master. Today he has his birthday the children have given this for him. Show it to me. Wow! That's a good sweater. What's this? 'Happy birthday, brother.' 'We use to celebrate today's day so well together..' '..but today, there isn't anything.' 'I feel so lonely.' 'Brother, you have completely forgotten us..' '..but we didn't forget you.' 'Accept this small gift from your brother and sister.' 'Ashu, Raju.' Raju, Ashu. Don't feel bad. Like every year, Rakesh's birthday will be celebrated here.. And you will give these gifts to your brother. Make preparations, I'll get him. "Happy birthday to you!" - "Happy birthday to you!" - Come, have this. - Cheers! - Let's have some music! Come on! Come on! Let's dance everybody! Come on! Cheers! Happy birthday, Mr. Rakesh. Why did you show your damned face in my house? - I have come to take you. - You have come to take me? On whose order? This request is mine, Mr. Rakesh. Come for a short while.. Your brother and sister are anxiously anticipating your coming. You are daddy's servant.. Who are you to interfere in our personal matter? I am an outsider but you should come for your people. Shut up and get lost! I won't go alone. Pannalal, he won't go alone. Come. Come on! Mother, brother has come. - Rakesh, you came? - I didn't come, I have been brought here. I ask you how did this worthless man dare to enter my home? How did this ruffian picked up from the streets.. Dare to ruin my birthday party? All this has happened due to you people. You have given him support, you have vitiated him! Otherwise how would a man whom we feed.. - Dare to insult me among many people. - Rakesh! Are you satisfied by having me insulted? You removed me from your heart. Removed me from our home.. You are not interested in my happiness.. You don't have any sympathy for my sadness.. Why did you need to celebrate my birthday? It was not needed! I don't want a candle of your name to burn in my home. It was their mistake, their stubbornness.. They were asking for love and happiness from a person like you. I'll have their happiness completed. Congratulations to you people on my birthday! Sir, could you tell me this address? Wait. Sir, you had come for my birthday.. But I couldn't serve you anything and I regret that. Today we will celebrate your birthday.. And I'll give you such a present.. Through which you will remember me on your every birthday! Why are you showing your bravery with the help of your servants? I can give you such a present which will make you.. Remember today's day till the day of your death! The hands that rise against me are always broken. Shanno? Anand! Anand! Anand! Anand! Anand! Anand! Anand, don't spare him today! He must know that someone who can retaliate to his cruelty is born! Teach him such a lesson that.. He shouldn't be able to raise his hand again. He must know what pain is and what a wound is. Don't spare him, kill him. I feel like mortally wounding you but I am helpless. You are that man's son, whom I revere.. You are that mother's son who is like my mother. Get lost! Come. I'll get warm water. Mr. Rai? What brings you here? If there was an important, you should have called me. It was duty to come to you. Anand. - I am here to apologise to you. - What? Rakesh didn't attack you.. - He has hit me. - Mr. Rai! Anand. Due to my son's evil deeds my fate has changed. It looks as if I have a debt from the last life.. I am repaying it in the form of apologies and shame. Forgive me. Even though the owner is so rich, he looked so poor. What did Rakesh give to his parents and siblings? God gave them everything but kept back one. It is called happiness.. And there is no one in this house who can bring happiness. Are you fooling me? - Me. - Yes. Brother! "My dear sister, darling sister." "While I am here, don't be immersed in tears." "I agree to what you say, say it again." "My dear sister, darling sister." "I don't know what good deeds I did." "I received this house which is like a temple." "The day you came into this house." "This house really turned into a temple." - "Do you swear by me? - I do." "I wish to stay only here now." "Say it again." "My dear sister, darling sister." "Give me all work that is incomplete." "See dreams, I'll have them completed." "You must be the dream of every mother and father." "There won't be anyone dear like you." - "Do you swear by me? - I do." "I will forever agree to your saying." "Say it again." - "Sister." - "I am your dear one, your darling sister." "While I am here, don't be immersed in tears." "I agree to what you say. I don't want to stay without you." "My dear sister, darling sister." God, I haven't asked for anything from You for myself till today. Today, I ask for my sister's feet. She has a mountain like life before her. Take my feet but give my sister a new life. If I see her walking.. My life will be a successful. Have mercy on her, God! Have mercy! Have mercy on her! My dear... Shobha... God has listened to us. Today, we have found a son. Well done. You have made such a drama. You have acted so well. Today, we have succeeded in my scheme. - Cheers! - Cheers! You are the one who is responsible for this scheme's success, boss. - Cheers! - But my boy.. The wonder that you have shown, it is remarkable. You have made a net of emotions. Now, Mr. Rai's family cannot escape the trap. Mr. and Mrs. Rai are in my control. I have become their children's real brother. I have fooled them so well that they have all become blind. When I'll clear all the stuff there, they'll see the light. Oh my God! For reaching till here, I had to do a lot of drama. 'Here, make your signature.' - I'm sorry, boss! - Lightly! I'm still in pain. Now there mustn't be a long time to reach the goal. My innocent boss! I have reached till their hearts.. How much more time could it take to reach their treasure? Cheers! Diwan uncle has come, should I... - Hi, uncle! - Hi? Child, are you alright? - Why are you moaning? - Uncle, you are a big bore. Thank you, child. Once more. Do you know what Ashu is calling you? What is she saying? She is praising me, what else? Sir, agree that you don't know English. I don't know English? I have learnt English from the English. But there was a time when the English had to learn English from me. They use to walk miles and come to me.. To get Hindi translated into English and vice versa. - So then, let's have a translation. - Yes. - Make its English form. - I'll make it. 'You and I are shut in a room.' You, I, one room closed. 'And the key should be lost.' And key loses. Wow! Diwan Chotelal, you are great! English is alive in this country only due to you. Thank you, sir. - Anand hasn't come from office yet? - He has gone to the city. He said he has some important task. The poor guy has to do a lot of work. - "There is liquor. - Yes, there is liquor." - "There is youthfulness. - Yes, there is youthfulness." "They are all fantastic." "It is fantastic." "Crazy heart, tell me." "What else do you want?" "What do you want?" "Crazy heart, tell me." "What else do you want?" "What do you want?" - "There is liquor. - Yes, there is liquor." - "There is youthfulness. - Yes, there is youthfulness." "Unkind thing, I have fulfilled all your persistence." "O crazy heart." "Everyone that you loved, I loved her too." "I went everywhere you told me to. I passed through every mission." "I listen only to you, tell me." "What else do you want? What do you want?" "You crazy thing, tell us." "What else do you want? What do you want?" "If the Sheikh touches the grape, I'll reveal it to everyone." "To everyone." "He used to eat sweet tablets, I would drink through the sea." - "This is that liquor. - Yes, it is liquor." - "There is youthfulness. - Yes, there is youthfulness." "They are all fantastic." "It is fantastic." "Crazy heart, tell me." "What else do you want?" "What do you want?" "Crazy heart, tell me." "What else do you want? What do you want?" "Drink the booze that comes out of darling's eyes." "O crazy heart." "The world may think as it wants to, you should live as you want to." "There is no objection, there is no shame, don't hide your condition." "Don't give me excuses." "Tell me, what else do you want? What do you want?" "O crazy heart, tell me." "What else do you want? What do you want?" "The statues of Ajanta are dancing merrily." "In innocent ways are hidden such attractive faces." "Here is a gathering of fairies, there is a meeting of beauties." "Here, I wish to die, there I wish to live." "Tell me where do I live." "What else do you want? What do you want?" "O crazy heart, tell me." "What else do you want? What do you want?" "What do you want? What do you want?" "What do you want?" Anand? Anand. You are very cruel. You woke me and broke connections of hearts. I was seeing such a beautiful dream. My boy, leave those dreams and come into the world of reality. Don't forget that now you are not alone in this world. - You have a mother, father, brother... - Leave that! Say something to make up a mood. - Let's have a drink. Come. - No! You have your whole life for that. Duty is duty. Go, your family is waiting for you. - Go on. - Alright. - Anand, should I set food on the table? - I have had my food. Ashu and Raju are here? They waited for you and fell asleep. They didn't even have their food. - Get the food. Here. - Okay. Raju. Ashu. Ashu get up. What is this? Why didn't you have dinner? Since you came here, brother.. Has it ever happened that we had food without you? Okay. This will never happen again. Okay? I'm sorry. Mother, daddy, brother has come. Come on for eating food. You people are strange. You have acted like these children. Look, Anand. The truth is that I am feeling very hungry. Sit down. I was going to eat.. When I saw that children were on a hunger strike. I talked to these children's mother.. I found that even she has a hunger strike. I was ashamed. The morsel remained in my hands.. And even the father of these children went on a hunger strike. Anand, you know what? Even if I had food without you, it wouldn't have satiated my hunger. Shanno, why are you angry with me? What is it? The thing is that I have found your truth. - Truth? - Yes. You are a cheat! You are a betrayer! A thief! A stealer! - What are you saying? - I am right. You stole my sleep, you stole my heart, of a poor girl.. You trapped me in the net of your love and cheated me. What has happened to you? Why are you talking like this today? I have met you today after so many days. You have become a big man. Staying in palaces, why would you remember people who stay in huts? I understood it. So that's why you are angry? Big people understand unimportant people's words a little late. - Shanno, don't you trust me? - Absolutely not. You shouldn't have any. It's true, Shanno. I am a cheater, I am a betrayer, a thief and a stealer. Tell me. Even after knowing all this would you love me? Yes, I will. I will always do, Anand. However you may be you are mine and forever you will be mine. Chotelal, I want Rs. 10,000 right now. Prepare a cheque quickly and get it signed from daddy. Sir, that department has now been handed by the owner to Anand. Now the owner doesn't sign the cheque, Anand does. What? That scoundrel has turned into the owner? Well, you are the actual owner. Forget about Rs. 10,000, you may take Rs. 20,000. Go and take it from him. 'I want Rs. 10,000 rupees.' Is it your father's money? Come, Mr. Rakesh. Have a seat. I haven't come to sit. I want Rs. 10,000. I have already kept your monthly cheque of Rs. 5000 ready. Take it. - I want Rs. 5000 more. - But in which account? - I don't know that. - Then I can't give it to you. You will have to give it. I am ordering you. - I request you. - Don't forget that you are my servant. I am the company's servant.. And I can't go against the company's rules and laws. I'm sorry. You may leave. I will have to remove this thorn's obstacle. Pannalal, that scoundrel won't see tomorrow's sun in our factory. Hello? Garry. I'm Rakesh speaking. This amount of 2 lakhs has just been given by our contractor, Mr. Khanna. The bank must have been closed. Alright, I'll take it home. It is not right to keep such a big amount at home. There is still some time. I'll go to the city and have it deposited in bank. As you like. Is someone here? There was neither driver in the truck nor cleaner. As soon as I turned, the bag was missing I looked around but I couldn't see anyone. Such a big amount, I don't know... Don't worry, Anand. Do this, report to the police. Anand, when did this incident take place? Around 4. Around 4? I saw you at that time going to Shanno's home. - What? What are you saying? - Strange. I even saluted you.. But I don't know what you were thinking about. - What is this nonsense? - You are lying. Get out of here. - No. The doubt that he has created, I'll clear it. - Come with me. Come! - Come. All of you have come here? What is it? We have to search your home, Shanno. - Our home's search? - Not your search, it's mine. Some people think that I came to your home today.. And I have hidden the company's money at your place. But, you haven't come since many days. Let him have a search. - Go. - Go! - Diwan. - Yes? - Look at this. Sir, we have found the money. But how did this bag come in our home? This is all a lie. It is a conspiracy. - Such a big lie? - Such a big fraud? - Is Anand such a man? - I had doubts earlier. I was certain. One day this would happen. Now you will see what happens ahead. Daddy, have more trust on this cheat, embrace him more. Listen to me. Hand him your property and you both should go to Haridwar. Send Raju and Ashu to an orphanage and I am already an orphan. You scoundrel! How will you hide yourself now? You have been exposed. You have had a lot of fun.. - Now you will suffer in jail! - Save me! - Save me! - I'll thrash you to pulp! - Save me! - You scoundrel! - Save me! - Save me! - Karan, why are you hitting him? Not only me, all of you will hit him together now. He was giving liquor in his den.. And he was throwing these 100's currency. From where have these notes come? Tell me what you were saying in the den. - Tell me, whose name were you taking? - Hail Rakesh. Sir, who pays Rs. 5000 for a task worth Rs. 5? To stop a truck, lift a bag and keep the bag at Shanno's home. Live long, Rakesh! You are a great kind man, sir! This scoundrel is lying while he is drunk. Sir, a man always says the truth when he is drunk. There are Rs. 5000 less in this bag. I couldn't even think that you would do something so cheap! Didn't you have shame while tricking this innocent man? Rakesh, the stone that you lifted against him.. It has become a mark on your head. You shameless fellow! He who thought your siblings to be his.. He was a support to your parents support.. You want to ruin him? We were dying in every moment.. Now there was a reason to live.. You couldn't even see that. You have already taken everything. The gift of love and faith that we had got from God.. You wanted to steal that too and make us beggars? Isn't that so? Dear... Forgive us. Forgive us. We misunderstood you. Garry, what happened? I trusted you and gave you this job.. But you foiled my plan. I'm ruined, I'm doomed. Rakesh, I am myself very disturbed. Till today, none of my plans have failed. That truck driver drank liquor and foiled a well-made plan. I'll bury him alive. But what about me now? Don't worry. Trust my friendship. If I am alive such 1000 opportunities will come. It was good that your enemy.. Came to your guru to have you destroyed.. And guru changed the situation in such a way that he was upturned. You have been positioned forever. But Anand, this doesn't mean that the danger has passed. Now, you'll have to be more careful with Rakesh. I would say that you should complete this task as early as possible. Anand... yesterday's incident has shaken me. I feel broken. God has saved you. Otherwise, we would have lost you. Today you are a big support for us. We are all living supported by each other. No one knows.. When a support will be lost. Before time plays any more games.. I want to hand you all my responsibility. Come with me. Come. Anand... This is our small treasure. No one knows about it other than us. And Rakesh doesn't deserve to be brought here by us. Anand, this jewellery that you see is expensive.. But among them a priceless thing is, this statue. Our emotions are attached towards it. It is our family's respect and a symbol from our ancestors. We love it more than our lives. Anand, this is our asset. From today, you will take care of it. It was my search for many years. Goddess, I have seen you. Now, open the doors to my fate. Nandlal, is there any difference between this one and that? There is a difference. This is a fake, and that one is real. - Oh! - Don't worry Mr. Girdhari. Many years ago.. I had made that statue for Mr. Rai's father and given it to him. Live long! I don't know whether to call you Nandlal, Nand or Nandu. It appears as if you were alive for this day. It must be the same doctor, 100/180. No. You have made more progress, 110/190. And the reward for this is that now.. You will have to rest and forget about going to Delhi. What would you doctors lose by giving orders? For your information, if I don't go to Delhi from today's flight.. - There will be a loss amounting in lakhs! - Let it be! - You won't go. - I'll go to Delhi. No brother, you can't go. - Why? - Tomorrow is Raksha-bandhan. For the first time this sister will tie a Rakhi to her brother. Ashu, my departure is very important. No brother, this is the first happiness of a sister. It's her first desire. No matter what happens, I won't let you go. I won't let you go. Alright, I won't go. Happy? Thank you. Ashu. You are here? Brother, you were cheating your sister and leaving? Didn't you even care about my Rakhi? - Ashu, why don't you understand? - I don't want to listen to anything. - What are you doing?! - I won't let you go! No man can work like this. If these two keep being stubborn like this.. The whole business will be ruined. Ashu, you are elder and intelligent.. Think, my not going has caused such a great loss. This is called childish ignorance, not love. - Hello. - Sir, I'm Chander speaking from the office. - What is it? - There is bad news. - What happened? - The airplane through which Anand.. Was to go to Delhi has crashed. And there are no survivors. Mr. Rai! What happened, Mr. Rai? Why don't you speak? What is it? What has happened? Tell me! The airplane through which Anand.. - Was to go to Delhi has crashed. - What? And there are no survivors. "There would have been a great disaster today." "This Raksha-Bandhan has become a giver of life." "The love that I wished for, I have got it now." "I have got the real right to tie a Rakhi." - "Do you swear by me? - I swear." "Don't make a delay, tie me the Rakhi now." "Say it again." "My dear sister, darling sister." Forgive me, Girdhari. I am ruined. Their love and faith has ruined me. Now that house is mine. I can't loot my home. I can't do it, Girdhari. Forgive me. - What happened to you Anand? - I am reformed now. I was lost. I have found a way, I was homeless, I found a home. I was an orphan, I got parents and siblings. Today, I have a family. I have become that family's son. Now I can't stay in that house as a thief. I can't stay in that house as a thief. I am very happy to see tears in these eyes. All the dirt in your heart has been cleaned. I congratulate you on your rebirth. I am your own. There won't be any shadow of earlier events on you. Go. Live fearlessly. My blessings are always with you. Thank you, Girdhari. Thank you. Thank you so much! 'Now Mr. Rai's family can't come out of this trap.' 'Mr. and Mrs. Rai are in my control.' 'I have become their children's real brother.' 'I have fooled them so well that they have all become blind..' '..when I'll clear all the stuff there, they'll see the light.' - What is this? - A deal. I didn't understand. Nobody can understand Girdhari. This is proof of your good deeds.. - It will be delivered to your family. - Girdhari! Anger always causes a loss to man. This world is of giving and taking. A man has to pay a price to stay alive. What do you want? How did you get this statue? This means that you have seen the real statue. So is this a fake statue? There is no difference between the real and fake.. Now your task is only to get this statue there and that one here. 'This is our asset.' 'From today, you will take care of it.' - No! No, this can't be done. This is not possible! It is my respect, my responsibility. You can never have that statue. - But this tape can be received by them. - Girdhari! No! Don't do such a thing. I have been sunk into the Ganges and found them. The alms of these relations is my life today. Don't steal this light from me, Girdhari. Give me freedom. I can't break their trust. If you wish to, you may kill me! You can cut me into pieces.. But please don't fill my life with this poison. With this poison your soul will be purified.. You will be set free forever. You want freedom and I want the statue. You will have to pay this fee. Boy, this good work should be done today. Tonight there is a birthday party of Mr. Rai. You won't get a better chance than this. So you want to make Anand the owner of your property? Yes. Because I don't trust my son Rakesh at all. Sir, this will is mandatory.. So that my family lives in peace after I die. - Mr. Rai, do you trust Anand? - Absolutely. "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." Many happy returns of the day, daddy. Thank you, darling. - Happy birthday, daddy. - Thank you, my dear. Where is my present? This is the present from us. Boss, first open the present and check what is inside it. I feel scared to unwrap priceless present, child. It might get stolen. Ladies and gentlemen. You all know that on this auspicious day.. You get a bonus of one month every year. But this year.. I am giving you bonus of 3 months. Applause. Manager, where are you lost? Celebrate. - You too got a bonus of 3 months. - No, Shanno. Anand didn't get a bonus of 3 months.. But a bonus of our love and trust for his whole life. Wow! You are very lucky, sir. This is a bonus which will never get depleted.. But it keeps of on increasing. Why are you looking at me now? Come, dance and sing with us today. Come on. "Mister Manager." "You too dance and sing with us for some time." "You too dance and sing with us for some time." "Mister Manager." "Mister Manager." "I had witnessed this day in the past too." "But this happiness has doubled because of you." "This happiness has doubled because of you." "Don't go away making some excuse, now don't get upset with us." "Don't go away making some excuse, now don't get upset with us." "You are now mine." "Don't break this relationship." "You too dance and sing with us for some time." "You too dance and sing with us for some time." "Mister Manager." "Mister Manager." "Who has taught me to laugh and filled my life with colours and fragrance." "Who has taught me to laugh and filled my life with colours and fragrance." "I pray to God." "That my life should be for him." "That my life should be for him." "He is a deity." "Whom I have found." "You too dance and sing with us for some time." "You too dance and sing with us for some time." "Mister Manager." "Mister Manager." Mr. Rai. No! Scoundrel, I will avenge my father's death with you. Thieves plunder at the point of a weapon.. But you have strangled us with your love. Imposter! You acted like a brother and son and broke the trust of my mother and sister. Scoundrel, I don't want to kill you with my own hands. - Ram Singh, phone the police. - There is no need to phone them. Let him go. Ruffian! 'This is the story of this unfortunate man.' 'Shanno, forget me if possible.' No Shanno, nothing can be done now. I can't stay here. I am defamed as thief. - Nobody can erase this disgrace. - You can do it. The time has changed now. The man who made me human I betrayed his trust. That great man died with a burden on his soul. - His funeral procession took place and I felt as if I had died. - Anand. My life is worthless now. You have. You will live for the same house.. Where you came to plunder wealth.. But they made you rich with the wealth of love and trust. Under whose care are you leaving them? Of Rakesh? He was waiting for this day only. Now he will take revenge with everyone. The mother will have to beg for her life. The children will live on his mercy. - Those innocents will have to suffer because of your crime. - No! Now you will have to live here. You will have to protect the belongings of the master. This is your duty and your penance. 'This is your duty and your penance.' I thought that he was the king of destiny.. But he turned out to be as useless as stone. But what will happen now, sir? My one man has been defeated. No problem. I have the other pawn in stock. - I will fit him. - What do you mean? It won't be too difficult.. To make use of Rakesh. Cheers! Sir, you are great. We should learn to live our lives from you. - Life means to live in liveliness. - Great! - Well said. - Stop it! - Raju. Stop this evil act. Our house is like a temple. I won't let this become a den of gratification. Disrespectful! How dare you drink liquor in front of your elder brother? How did I dare? When you can dare to drink liquor in front of helpless mother and sister.. And righteous father.. - Then I too can drink in front of worthless brother. - Shut up! Drink! Drink more! Now this was the only thing left. Stupid! Celebrate. All of you celebrate. You won't offer the water of Ganges to the ashes of your father.. But with drops of liquor. With drops of liquor! Raju, why are you crying? What happened? Tell me what happened, Raju. Rakesh brother has defiled the whole house. Immoral people come to the house. They drink liquor. They sing and dance. Mother cries secretly. She cannot say anything. Brother Rakesh orders mother around. He scolds sister and beats me. No, Raju. Don't cry. I won't go there again. I won't live there. Alright, do stay there. Will you stay with me? Come on. No, no. I will not stay here. I will not stay here. Come on, darling. Cheers! Everybody. Cheers. Cheers! I love you, darling. Come on, you don't kiss me. I love you wholeheartedly. - You won't get some. - Gopal, I am feeling suffocated here. - Take me away from here. - Gopal! - I am coming, sir. Ma'am! When God has not given you leg then why you are interested in roaming around. Can't you sit at one place? I can't tolerate this. I will have to send you to some hermitage very soon. This living corpse won't be in my house anymore. 'This living corpse won't be in my house anymore.' 'This living corpse won't be in my house anymore.' Ashu! Ashu! Ashu, wait! Ashu, what were you going to do? Why did you save me? To keep me alive and watch my helplessness with joy. - No, Ashu, no. - No. - No, Ashu. - We were already living a miserable life. What did you get by making it worse? You are the one who has ruined this bungalow.. Where people are living like a corpse. Don't go avoiding me like this, ma'am. I can't endure it anymore. Your silence is killing me. Curse me, scold me. You can call me a murderer! Say something. I am your culprit. Punish me. Crush me. I will tolerate all the punishment.. But I can't tolerate the pain of your silence. Don't give me so severe punishment, ma'am. I can neither live nor die. You would be the lord of the whole world. You are not my lord. You have always given me suffering. I was like a stone, but you gave me feelings. I was a sinner, you made me human. You filled my heart with emotions and taught me the meaning of love. When my small world was settled.. You ruined it. You made me lonely. You gave me everything and then took it away. So, now take away my feelings. Make me like a stone again.. So that I can neither see.. Nor hear.. Nor feel anything. The statue is in our house? It is not just a statue but a key to change your destiny. Friend, you don't know your worth. You are not millionaire but billionaire. Billionaire? Yes, bring that statue. And then see how I will change your status. Statue? What statue? The same family heirloom that you hid even from your own son till today. - I want that statue. - Why? Mother, you don't know it's worth. We are only called millionaire. That statue will open the doors of wealth for us. I will expand my business. I will start derbies, buildings, 5-star hotels. - I will become a rich man. - By selling the honour of your ancestors. This is the world of business and not sentiments. I won't let the symbol of my ancestors to be auctioned in the market. - It is our faith, worship and God. - Today, money is the biggest God. You can worship even a God made up of mud. - Give me the keys. - You won't get the keys. Why won't I get it? My orders are obeyed here. - You will have to give me the keys. - I won't give you the keys. Mother! Mother, I will take the key. - Give me the keys! - No. - Give me the keys! - No. - No! How dare you raise your hand on mother! I will avenge the injustice that you did on them. You have hurt the feelings of your sad sister. Scoundrel! You have hurt the mother who gave birth to you. You made her cry in sorrow. I won't allow you to live here. Get out of my house. - Your house? - Yes, my house. This is Mr. Rai's Will. All the things of this place are bestowed to me by its rule. I am the owner of this house. I never wanted to make use of this will. Rakesh, the life of your father couldn't make you a good human being.. But I was hopeful that his death will make you a good human.. Good son, and good brother. But you have become more devilish. You made their lives miserable. Your cruelty increased. Therefore, I was forced to make use of this will. Get out of here. I say, get out! But whatever Anand thought didn't happen. Destiny has played a cruel joke on that sad man. Ma'am, he has already been punished. He is trying to repent for his crimes. If possible, forgive him. Sign here. Girdhari, if this wealth and property had been mine.. Then I would have given it to a greedy dog like you. But it belongs to that righteous woman and those innocent children. Scoundrels, you can skin me alive.. But you won't get what you want. Understood? Uncle Diwan has not yet come. - Shanno, I found Anand. - Where is he? - We couldn't find Shanno. - What did you say? Sir, we searched each and every corner. Shut up! No matter how, but find Shanno and bring her here. If we don't find Shanno, I won't spare you alive. On Anand's birthday.. I want to see beauties and suffering of a lover. So, I want Shanno. Whether she's real or look alike. - Look alike? - Yes. Look alike. "Happy birthday to you!" "Happy birthday to you." "Happy birthday to you." Shanno? Leave me! Leave me! Scoundrel, let go of me! Ready? Ready, Raju. Wait! Untie him. "Don't write your name in any case." "On some wrong papers." "I have brought the page of heart." "I will make you write your name on it."

Now he is using that art against me." - Mr. Diwan. - Yes. You were my own men. Then what was the need to come as a stranger? Sir, I have not come, but I have been brought here. Old age has come in your childhood. Dear, you still have your milk teeth. Tie all of them. - Why are you taking this trouble? I will walk myself. - Shut up! Drink it. Bravo! Bravo, he is finished. Bravo, - She is our Shanno. - She is a look alike. Anand! Anand! - Doctor... - He is out of danger. We have removed the bullet. Doctor, I want to take the statement of Mr. Anand. Not now. You can take this statement tomorrow morning. Mother. Mother, please save me. I have shot Anand. Today my life and death is in his hands. Save me before he gives statement to the police. Mother, save me. I know that he respects you very much. He will never go against you. You can only save me. You can only save me, mother. - Only you save me. - Nobody can save Rakesh now. - He should be punished for his crimes. - Good morning, Mr. Anand. Mr. Anand, I have come to take you statement. - Statement? - Yes. The police wants to know that.. In the commotion of Prem Kutir, who shot at you? Inspector, I don't know that in such a huge commotion.. Who shot the bullet and from where. Anand, I didn't think that you would save me. By saving me you have killed the demon that was residing in me. I can never forget your favour. Even a real brother can't be so kind. Please forgive me, my brother. Forgive me. Forgive me, my brother. Forgive me. Don't ask forgiveness from me, but that Goddess. Touch mother's feet. You will get ablution from all your crimes. Please forgive me, mother. Please forgive me. Ma'am.. I am very unfortunate. I can't even ask for your forgiveness.. Because I know that my crime is unpardonable. I am going far away from all of you. But I am not going empty-handed. I am leaving after stealing many things. Mother's love.. And love of brother and sister. Son! "I don't know for which deeds I got this boon." "I received this house which is like a temple." "You must be the dream of every mother and father." "There won't be anyone dear like you."
