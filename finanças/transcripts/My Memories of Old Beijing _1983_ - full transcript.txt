I don't try to remember. But forgetting is hard. More than half a century has gone by. I've been missing the scenes and the people of south side of Peking city. Perhaps things and people are all different now. But as time ripples away, they are becoming clearer to me, a wanderer far away from home. Though I've lived through several significant events, they were all eroded by the time. It's these trifles in my childhood no matter the sweets or the bitters of life that remain in my mind forever and ever. Isn't everyone's childhood unfailing and sublime like this? My memories of old Beijing original story by lin hai-yin adapted by yi ming directed by wu yigong photographer cao weiye Sound recordist xie guojie film editing by Ian weijie Make-up by li pingwang and zhengrong lighting by zhang chuanxia set decorator xia linbao properties by zhang liwu costume by ma hongxiang and chen meilian art design by ye hongxiong sound imitation by qian shouyi producer xu songlin music by Shanghai film orchestra conductor yao di voiceover by lin bin Excuse me. Do me a favor. - Good - good. Slowly. Papa, why do camels wear a bell? To scare the wolves away, of course. No. The treks are too boring. Tying the bells on camels brings pleasant sound and joy. Ah. Perhaps your idea is more appealing. Husband. Tell shu'an-tse to be careful while grazing. Not to play too hard. - Don't worry. Just go back. - Fine. Hsiao kuei-tse. My hsiao kuei-tse. Ying-tse! Come. Go home. Don't you know she's crazy? How dare you talk to her. Sung ma, if there's mandarin fish, - get some back. - Ok. Ma, I'll go to markets with sung ma. Aren't you afraid of the mad woman in hui-an hostel? Every time I see her, she'll smile at me. If you hadn't stopped me, I could have talked with her. Aha, what an audacious girl! Look! How perky they look! Hey, the latter behind. My dear brothers, may I have your applause! Bravo toast to you! What's wrong, niu-er? Sing a bit fen river bend. Yeah, sing a segment. Sing. Go head! Sing or I won't let you go. Who do you think you are? Impressive. Sung ma, I want to chat with niu-er. Fine. - But not be long. - Ok. Niu-er niu-er. Do you live in that hu-t'ung? UN-huh. Which door? One, two, three, four. The forth door. Shall we play there? There is a mad woman in your hu-t'ung. My mom never lets me go there. What are you afraid of? She won't eat you. Forget it. My father asks me to practice singing later. See you tomorrow. Peanuts. Peanuts. Honeycomb briquette. Hsiao kuei-tse. My hsiao kuei-tse. No. My name is ying-tse. Lin ying-tse. Ah... not her... She's not my hsiao kuei-tse. Who is hsiao kuei-tse? Come with me. Look! How chubby is our hsiao kuei-tse! She was only eight months then. Holding a big goldfish and running around the room. She was so naughty! All right. That's enough. - Won't you feel ashamed? - Without eating nor wearing clothes, she ran straight outside, worried to look for her dad. I told her many times. She never listened. I told her to wait until I made more clothes. And she could go out with them on. I've already made the shirt for this year. The vest just needs the buttons sewn on. This padded jacket just needs a neckline. Look! What have I said? It's perfect. What's the hurry! What's on earth the matter? And later? Any news from that student? Dead or alive, who knows. It's said that... she even gave birth to a baby? It's true. When that student was captured, hsiu-chen's parents didn't know she was expecting. Until it became obvious, she was hurriedly sent back to hai-tien to give birth. What about the baby? As soon as it was born, they bundled it up and took it to chi-hua gate before daybreak and left it there. Alas. Anyway, if it wasn't taken by someone, then it was eaten by wild dogs. I see. Did the girl become mad after that? Of course. She's been mad since then. How poor her parents are! She is the only child they have. You're eavesdropping again! I know who you're talking about. Who? Hsiao kuei-tse's ma. Hsiao kuei-tse's ma? Dear. It seams you're crazy as well. Who's hsiao kui-tse's ma? Humph. I just know it. Niu-er. Niu-er. Look! Hey. Stop here. Papa. We don't get home yet. Only a few steps to go. I'll go inside. Why do you go there? Will you call on hsiu-chen as well? Hsiu-chen? Ah. No. I have something to deal with. You can go home first. Let's talk. Let's talk. Hello, Mr. Lin. Hello. You're here, too. As for what we talked about last time, we all hope you can share your opinions. All right. This way. Watch out. Hsiao kuei-tse. Why do you leave your mama? My hsiao kuei-tse. Without me, how could you know the way? It's so far... I like you. I like you, too. You're just like our hsiao kuei-tse. Oh. If you see my hsiao kuei-tse, tell her to hurry back home. I won't spank or scold her. Ok. How about her papa? Hsiao kuei-tse's papa. Quiet. He has gone for several months. Does this coat belong to hsiao kuei-tse's papa? How do you know it's hsiao kuei-tse's papa's? He is the third child of his family. You can call him third uncle. Come. Help me carry it out. It needs sunning. All right? - Ok. - It's not heavy. Is your daughter better these days? Don't mention it, Mr. Lin. It happens again these days. Spells of crying and laughing. - That would be tough. - Yeah. - See you next time. - Fine. See you. I should go. You played around the well, didn't you? You may fall into it. Better ask around which primary school is better at south side. It's time to send her to school. It's said that the primary school of the normal college at ch'ang-tien is quite good. It's still early. What's the hurry? Not going to school, shed'd run around streets. She won't listen to me. Aha. If she doesn't listen, just spank her! Pass me that. The situations these days are kind of tense. But you still frequent hui-an hostel and get involved in those students' affairs. Why so scared? Look at yourself, always minding other's business. Don't you hear that they're capturing people all around. Students are their target. They stand for the extraordinary new generation. And I heard that the lover of the mad woman in hui-an hostel... It was after midnight, here came so many people. I was so deep asleep. They arrested many students all of sudden. Including your uncle szu-k'ang why was he arrested? Who knows. I just learned from my dad that bad rumors were going around. Many people had been taken away from Peking university. They were all brought to trial. What does trial mean? Look. The flames are already high. Ying-tse. Do you keep in mind what I've told you? Think! I just told you. What? You told me many things. The very most important one. Oh. I remember that. When seeing hsiao kuei-tse, I'll take her home. You won't spank or scold her. But how can you recognize hsiao kuei-tse? You've told me there's a blue sesame-sized birthmark on her nape. The blue Mark! Yes, yes, yes. The king of hell got so furious that he used his finger to push her into the word. Enough. Don't keep feeding them, or you will overstaff their stomach. Didn't you live in Peking before? No. My papa said we moved here from an island so far away called Taiwan. We didn't live here, either. We lived near chi-hua gate. Chi-hua gate? I know there. How do you know that? I saw that place in my dream. Is there a city wall? One day, there was a woman, with a bundle in her arms. She was walking stealthily toward the wall on a very early morning. Aren't you telling a story? Hsiao ying-tse, what are you pondering over, eh? Niu-er. Niu-er. Niu-er. Where is hsiu-chen? In the side courtyard. Hsiao ying-tse. Look. How come can you stand her rambling nonsense? It's strange. Children are all afraid of her. - Only you're not. - Ma, who's coming? - It's hsiao ying-tse. - Aunt hsiu-chen. Oh. Hsiao ying-tse comes. Hsiao ying-tse, why haven't you been here for long time? I miss you so much. Come. Let me dye your fingernails. Is that fingernail plant? It's peppermint. Look. These are fingernail plant. Come. Is this for eating? Does it need rock candy? Silly girl, you only think about eating. It's alum. - Not rock candy. - I see. Just watch. When they are dried, your fingernails will be red. Look. Just like mine. Szu-k'ang likes my red fingernails. Who's szu-k'ang? He's your third uncle. Now he's asleep. Yeah? It was just this season that he came. With a roll of bedding and a suitcase. He was in a grey long gown, with a pen clipped onto the lapel. I was cleaning the windowpane in the room. Then I heard my dad say "all the rooms of the main courtyard are occupied, "you may live in this side courtyard." With those words, they came in. My dad asked him in which school he studied. He said in Peking university. Dad said: "It's really faraway. "It's near sha-tan. "But it's a good school." He smiled. What a sweet smile! Standing by the window, I gazed at him. He came over, right stopped by the window. Suddenly he raised his head. It's a indeed fate. Can you understand? The fate. Ying-tse. Ying-tse. Niu-er. Ying-tse, I've been waiting for nearly a day. I come here to tell you that I'll come to see you tomorrow. Where have you been? Did you forget your lunch? Eh, eh. Wash your hands. Whew. Who did this? Little elf. Children shouldn't get nails dyed. I'm asking you who dyed your nails? Third aunt szu-k'ang. You always run around outside only to address others as uncles and aunts. The entrance exams to primary school will be in another month. You never stay at home to learn reading, but play around outside. Does your pa beat you? Yes. But it causes no pain. Like dusting my clothes. See. My pa did it. He beat you for what? He even lashed me. With what? The duster. My pa and my ma, they... They what? Nothing. I'll tell you next time. I know. Your pa forces you to sing opera. No. How can you know what I was going to say? So what on earth is it about? Tell me. You mustn't tell anyone else. I won't. Not even your ma. I won't. Let's talk in a whisper. I wasn't borne by my ma. My pa is not my real father. - Ma, I have a question. - What? Did you give birth to me? What? What makes you ask this? Just tell me yes or no. Silly girl. How could the answer be no? That's it. If you weren't my own child, how could I care for you like this? Then how was I borne by you? Uh... well... You fell out from here of course! You see. Everything is prepared. When you see hsiao kuei-tse, ask her to hurry back. Ok. Szu-k'ang has gone for couple of months. Or it has been six years... He'll be back in a month. Another month... Here comes hsiao kuei-tse! Yeah? Ying-tse, what are you looking at? Where's hsiao kuei-tse? You were just saying that. She's in here, not born yet. Humph! Ying-tse, everyone says I'm crazy. Do you think I'm crazy? Crazy people would pick things up from ground to eat and hit others randomly. How... how could I be a crazy woman? Do you think I'm crazy or not? Ying-tse. Niu-er. It's pouring. Why do you go out? Ying-tse, ying-tse. Why are you standing in the rain? Come. I ran away from home. I... I'm not going back again. I come here only to tell you that I'll look for my real parents. Where could you go in such a pouring rain? Anyway... I'll go to chi-hua gate to look for them. Where is chi-hua gate? All I know is that they took me from chi-hua gate. As soon as it was born, they bundled it up and took it to chi-hua gate before daybreak and left it there. All I know is that they took me from chi-hua gate. Hsiao kuei-tse. Hsiao kuei-tse! What's wrong with you? It's burning hot. Niu-er. No, hsiao kui-tse. Let me check you nape. Your ma said there's a blue Mark on your nape. What's wrong with you? Are you sick? No. Just let me check. It's you, it's you. You are hsiao kui-tse. What hsiao kuei-tse? You are talking nonsense. No. I'm quite sober. I won't talk nonsense. I know where your real ma is. She lives not far. Come. I take you to her. Where? Stop talking such nonsense. You scare me. I'm not talking nonsense. Your real ma made lots of clothes for you. She's been yearning for you all the time. Come. No need to hurry me. I'm going to bed right now. Ying-tse. You're soaking wet. Hsiao kuei-tse. Hsiao kuei-tse. It's my... my poor hsiao kuei-tse. My... it's my... It's my hsiao kuei-tse. Listen. The train. Hurry up. You're all wet. Get changed. Let's set off tonight. There's a train to Tianjin at eight fifty. We can take the ship in Tianjin. Let's look for your father together. Hurry up. Hurry. Hurry. You haven't called me yet. Call me ma. Say it. Call me ma. Hurry. Hurry. Niu-er. Niu-er. Hsiu-chen. Niu-er. Niu-er. Hsiu-chen. Hsiu-chen. Niu-er. Ying-tse. Ying-tse. Ying-tse. News. Hot news. Get a newspaper. A mother and her daughter killed by train. Just get a newspaper to learn more. News. Hot news. Get a newspaper. A mother and her daughter killed by train. Get a newspaper to learn more. Ma, is it still raining outside? There's no rain. It's sunny. Can you recognize me, ying-tse? Sung ma. You've been unconscious for many days. After you recover, we'll move to our new home. New home? Yes. A new home. Our new home is in hsin-lien-tse hu-t'ung remember, when the teacher examines you and asks you where your home is, just say: Hsin-lien-tse hu-t'ung. Well. Then... All right, all right. Stop thinking. Sleep. Just sleep some more. Ying-tse. What are you thinking about? Ah. Our ying-tse is thinking of her future. What does future mean? As for the future, it's about new home, new friends, and new school. Then what about the past? Let it be the past. It will be gradually forgotten. What are you doing? - Hurry. Let's play there. - Fine. Let's go. Fine. Yeah. Here's fine. And the money? - Don't forget to check our daughter. - Fine. Next time, bring shu'an-tse here. I haven't seen him for four or five years. - I miss him so much. - Fine. I'm leaving. Miss. The school is over? Did he take away all your money again? - Pa. Ma. - Yeah. - Is school over? - Yes. How was it today in school? I didn't say a single word in class. All right. Would you like some red jujube and iilium soup? - Yes. - Help yourself. Pa. We learned a new text today. It's quite interesting. May I read it for you? Sure. Let's go and see the sea let's go and see the sea on the vast blue sea are hoisted the white sails; the golden-red sun rises up above from the sea, shining on the sea, shining on the sails. Let's go and see the sea. Let's go and see the sea. - Pa, do you find it great? - Yes. Ma, what about you? I agree. I like this text. It's much more interesting than "man, hand, foot, knife, ruler, dog, cow, sheep" we learned last term. But you haven't seen the sea yet. But yes. We came here from a faraway island. Didn't we need a ship to sail across the sea? You were so little then. How come could you remember the sea? I just know it. I like this text. Reading it, I felt like lying on a boat. And the sea was like... Was like... Like what? I just know it anyway. You are talented. You can be a novelist when you grow up. What's a novelist? One who can write stories. Well. I will write stories about sea in the future. Kick it. Just kick it. - I got it. - That doesn't count. My ma says: No kicking against our door. Kick somewhere else. There's no one inside. We can play here. I heard that it's a haunted house. What to be afraid of during the day? Go. Wow. Great, great! It falls inside. And you can't find it. You go inside. Coward. Shame on you. Dare you? Why not? Lin ying-tse, haven't you found it? - Not yet. - Never mind. - Come out - ok. Madame, the zhang's living at the entrance of hu-t'ung was burglarized. Yes? During the day or night? I don't know. The thief stole a bronze plate, and a little alarm clock. We should also be more cautious. The lock of the front door has been broken for months. The cost of living is too high. The society is getting worse and worse. Getting a lock is helpless. Papa. Why does the thief steal from others? He needs to make a living but he doesn't have money. Why doesn't he have money? Uh, well... You're too young to understand. Papa, what does a thief look like? He has one nose and two eyes. Just like you and me. That's enough. Stop hounding me. Just do your homework. Whew. Look at the mud all over you! Did you get this by kicking ball with those two wild children? I didn't kick the ball. Who are you trying to fool? Look at your hair. Combed tidily in the morning and now it's like a little chicken house. You are such a naughty girl! Bring a look back. There are thieves everywhere these days. Even on the main streets such as hsin-hua street. Hsin-hua street? It's far away from us. Why so worried? - Isn't that right, ying-tse? - Uh-huh. Little girl! Why do you come here? I'm looking for a ball. I see. A ball. This one? - Yes. - Take it. Wait, little girl. How old are you? Are you going to school? Seven years old. I'm in grade one of ch'ang-tien school ch'ang-tien school? My younger brother studies there, too. He's in which grade? He'll graduate this year. What are you doing here? You tell me. I don't know. You come here to poop! - Yes, yes. - You're not sanitary! People like us can't afford to be sanitary. Here. These are for you. - No. - Just take them. Papa told me not to take things from others. Oh, what a child! Does your family know you came here? That's good. Be sure not to tell anyone you saw me. Ok? Ok. Go back home. It's getting dark. - What about you? - I'm going soon. You go first. Sir, madame. Things got serious this time. The zhang's was burglarized again last night. Over thirty garments were stolen. Probably the thief just aimed at the clothes which they took into the yard to sun. Today with the door open widely we could see everything inside. Gosh. The arbor, the pomegranate trees and the goldfish. The yard could be clearly seen. How's it going now? The police are investigating there. The crowds are watching the fun. Whew. Is that your face? How clean! They lost so many things, but you're talking about watching the fun. We lost over thirty garments and a big bronze plate. And a gilded heirloom clock. Ma, the silver hair clasp. Yes, yes. And a silver hair clasp. Hey. Come. - Hurry up. - What's the matter? Thank you for your help. Let's go and see the sea. Let's go and see the sea. On the vast blue sea, are hoisted the white sails; the golden-red sun rises up above from the sea, Oh, it's you. - The school is over? - Uh-huh. Why not go back home? I guessed you were here. Yeah? I forgot last time. What's your name? Ying-tse. Lin ying-tse. Ying-tse. It's a pretty name. However... What about your study? What position do you range in your class? Number twelve. Only twelve. You should be the number one. You played too much, didn't you? So did I when I was young. So I was poor in schooling. But my brother is a good student. He's the first in class every year. He's ambitious. He said he would go abroad to study when he grows up. But with a useless brother like me, a nobody, how could he get the support? Even though we only eat corn bread, we often don't know where to get the next meal. Does your family eat corn bread? Your family won't eat that thing. I bet you've never seen the sort of bread mixed with potherb. I have no choice but to do such things. Can you understand? My ma doesn't know what I'm doing. Neither does my brother, seeing me as a good brother. That's right somehow. I support him in his schooling, always hoping he would be a somebody. Am I not a good man? Ying-tse. You tell me. Am I a good man or a bad man? Not a good man? Not a bad man? You... I don't know. There are too many people. It's hard for me to tell. Can you distinguish the sea from the sky? Have you ever seen the sea? We learned a lesson, called let's go to see the sea. But I haven't seen the sea. I can't tell the difference between the sea and the sky. Neither can I tell that between good man and bad man. Yeah. Sea and sky. Good man and bad man. Little girl, one day in the future, you will be able to tell the difference. Little sparrow, little sparrow, where did your mother go? She went to find food, without her returning, I'm hungry and miserable you are my little friend. I am your good friend. Ma. Haven't pa's guests left? Go to sleep. What were those normal people executed for? What makes you ask this? I saw the execution today. The prisoners were all students. Perhaps they committed crime. What kind of crime? You just can't stop asking. Will you sleep or not? Today, they executed students again. But you still associate with them. It's so scary. What are you afraid of? Well, the neighbors may pay attention, and it's not good for our own children and servants to see them frequently. What do you women know? If you have made your decision, you'd better set off early. Yes. Mr. Lin is right. Take this with you. - It costs you too much. - Not at all. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Just take it. - Fine. Wish you a safe trip. Please help yourselves. Yes. Fine. Anything else to prepare? Please care for the things there. Ok. Feel assured. Oh, sorry to trouble you again. I have many worms in my home. I have many little peas in my home. What do you want to eat... Uh? Hello? Hello? Little girl, what's that thing in your hand? May I have a look? Where do you get it? Is it from your home? No. I picked it up over there. I see. I don't want it. You take it. - Thank you, little girl. - You're welcome. Beyond the pavilion, beside the ancient path, green grass joins the sky. Evening breeze sways willows, flute faintly heard. Sun sets hills behind. To the ends of the earth and corners of the seas half of my friends scattered. A scoop of thick wine to enjoy what joy remains. No more cold dreams tonight. Beyond the pavilion, beside the ancient path, green grass joins the sky. When will I see you again? Please don't tarry to return. To the ends of the earth and corners of the seas half of my friends scattered. To gather happily is rare in life, with so many separations. Ying-tse, did you touch this parcel? I thought it wasn't you. But it would be better if it had been you. Not me. I'm not complaining. I can't stay here anymore. Do you understand? From now on, don't come here to see me again. We can see each other anywhere in the future. Can't we? You seem to be especially upset today. - But yesterday... - Oh, yesterday yesterday... Little girl, I won't forget you. You are smart and kind. Go back home. Don't come here again these days. - Ok? - Ok. - Aunty. - Second uncle. Come here! Sung ma. What's happening? The thief. They captured the thief. - Er-ga-tse. - Where? Where is he? Hurry up! Chain him. Hey, he is bound on. The plainclothes policeman found him. - Which one? - The one in straw hat. Oh. No wonder he's been around here for days. Nothing to watch. Beyond the pavilion, beside the ancient path, green grass joins the sky. Evening breeze sways willows, flute faintly heard. Sun sets hills behind. To the ends of the earth and corners of the seas - See you. - See you. Pooh! Here you come again! Zhu-tse, did you see hsiao shu'an-tse before you left for Peking? .Uh... no... I didn't. I came here from my uncle's at liu village. You came from your uncle's. Ya-t'ou is being nursed by Jin-tse's ma at liu village. Have you heard if she is fine? No, I haven't. She must be all right. Don't worry. Second aunt, maybe you'd better go back to take a look. You haven't been back for three or four years. Uh, if you have nothing else to ask, I should go now. Wait a second. Never mind. You can go now. - Aunt, you don't have to accompany me. - Just go. Take my salutations to your parents. Got it. Little feet, smelly feet. How old is hsiao shu'an-tse? He's four years older than you. Twelve. He'll soon finish primary school. How can a country boy be as lucky as you? He takes care of other's oxen all year around. How about your ya-t'ou-tse? We pay someone to nurse her. Will she belong to you in the future? How can my daughter not belong to me? Do you belong to your ma? Why don't you nurse her by yourself? Why do you nurse us in our home? Why do you give others the money you earn? Why? Because... uh, you won't understand. We country people live a hard life. Hsiao shu'an-tse' pa does well in nothing. I ought to go home this year. I've had s strange feeling since the beginning of the year. Papa. Sir, you come home. Have you eaten dinner? Yes, lhave. - Papa, hug. - Well. - Here you come. - Yeah. Dear, let your papa have a rest. He is not well. Not that bad. Have you been to hospital? Yes. What did the doctor say? He asked me to stay in hospital for some time. Papa. Are you ill? Why don't I know that? Nothing. Go play with yourself. What are you doing, ying-tse? Nothing. Can you write a letter for me? To whom? Is it home-letter to feng ta-ming, feng village, niu-Ian mountain, shun-yi county? - Yes. - Sure. Not here. - Let's go to the kitchen. - Okay. What to you want to say in the letter? Just ask if they are all right. Tell hsiao shu'an-tse to be careful when he grazes in the field. Don't go and play in the stream. As for ya-t'ou-tse, don't forget to pay the nurse and to appreciate her help. He has taken home almost 200 silver dollars during these years. If it's possible, buy back the land we mortgaged. So that we don't have to till for others. Also drink less alcohol. I'm all right here. Except for missing the children so much. When he comes here next month, bring shu'an-tse with him. Seeing him, I could be assured. And... Just listen. Listen to the sound. Comparable to jiangxi porcelain. Where can you find a green bowl like this? Just add some more. Ma, I want a little stool. I want a little stool. Here. Add something, please. Just a bit more. Forget it. Let's go. - Just change! - Let's go. Go. All right, all right. Deal. Deal. What can I do? It's my first deal today. I want that one. Sister, I want a little stool. - Ying-tse, give me. - Here you are. Give us a little stool. Let's play inside. Look at our new stool. When hsiao shu'an-tse comes, - will you let him sit on your stool? - I will! I will, too! When he comes, don't laugh at him, ying-tse. He's a bumpkin from countryside. I won't. He is four years older than you. He must be very tall. Uh, he should be... Like this tall. Egg, egg shell, inside sits a boy. Boy goes to the market. Inside sits a granny. Granny goes to the temple. Inside sits a girl. Girl comes out to light a lamp. Only to burn her nose and eyes. Oh. It's burning hot. I'm afraid he gets measles. Yeah. It seems so. They are not formed yet. It'll be fine, just avoid the wind. Take some rush root soup and sleep all night he will be fine tomorrow. Can you throw the dregs on the streets? UN-huh. Be careful not to break the medicine pot. I'm not that careless. Here. Take it. I don't want to. - It's not bitter. - I don't want medicine. - Here. - I don't take medicine. Well. Look at you. It's not bitter. Take it. All right? You're behaving badly. Take or I let sung ma return home. Go home, sung ma. Take the little stool and new clothes. They are all for hsiao shuan-tse and hsiao ya-t'ou. Go home. I'm going home. - Sung ma. - I'm going home. Go home to see my hsiao shu'an-tse and hsiao ya-t'ou. Go home. I'm going home. - Sung ma, don't go. - Well. She won't go unless you take it. Good. Great. A bit more. I'm not going. - Sung ma - I won't go. I want my dear, not hsiao shu'an-tse, I don't want ya-t'ou-tse, I want you. Sung ma, don't go. I won't go home. I don't want hsiao shu'an-tse. You'd better follow the doctor's instructions to stay in hospital. You cough all the night. Even I feel the pain in my chest. After I drink up this bottle of medicine. - Ma. - Yeah? I saw sung ma cry last night. For what? To coax brother. I saw she cry while saying she didn't want hsiao shu'an-tse. She was missing her own children. She once mentioned that she wanted go home. If sung ma goes back, who will comb my hair in the morning? Who will wipe brother's burn after he poops? Locust tree, locust tree. Under it is built a stage. All the girls have come. All except my girl. Hark, hark, here she comes. Riding a donkey - holding an umbrella. - Look! Someone is coming. Her bottom bare, her hair coiled up... Whew! It's so hot. Where's my son? Uh. He... he went to his aunt's. Miss. These are for you. Under it is built a stage. All the girls... Ma, sung ma is crying. Her hsiao shu'an-tse has died. It's said the baby girl was nursed by someone. In fact, she was given away by him long time ago. But he confessed it until now. No wonder sung ma keeps saying she feels strange these days. The time her nephew came here, his words seemed hide something. - Ying-tse. Tell sung ma to come here. - Okay. Sung ma, pa wants you. I hate you. My baby girl was given away. Shu'an-tse are dead. I lost two children. What am I going home for? I won't go. Not in this life. To whom was your daughter given? Is it possible to find her? What a heartless man! That year, he took the baby away. He gave her away, even before he went out of hah-teh gate. He said he didn't take their money. I can't believe him. Who are those people? If we get a name, we can have some clues. He said it was a carriage driver. There are carriage drivers everywhere in Peking how can I find her? Doctor, where is the room 12? - Ying-tse - papa. Why do you come alone? Mama won't take me here, saying the children would affected by this disease. She is right. Don't come here again. But I miss papa. I miss you, too. What's this? Your report. How were your exams? Check by yourself. Wow. Impressive. You did quite well. Were you ever late for school this term? As it reads on it. Not once. Ever since that rainy day of my first school year, when I refused to get up and tried to escape from school then you spanked me, I've never been late for school. You still remember that. It's too painful to forget. Do you hate papa? Not at all. All right then. You have grown up, haven't you?
