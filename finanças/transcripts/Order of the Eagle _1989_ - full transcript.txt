Race time is-- What the hell's going on out here? [dramatic music] [gunshot] Find him! [birds chirping] Willie, how many times do I have to tell you not to throw your wet towels on my bed. Sorry. I can't believe my mother's going to Hawaii. She promised she'd be here for visiting day. I'd rather go to Hawaii, too. Thanks. Will, have you seen my compass? What, are you blind? It's right in front of you. You know, Greg, if I was you, I wouldn't worry about anything right now. With those three days alone in those mountains you're about to do. Yeah, I guess I kind of have my head up my ass, huh? Willie, is it really that tough? Well, let's just say, I wouldn't want to do it again unless I had to. Yeah, well I'm ready for it. You better be. See you in a few days, Willie. Hope you don't get too lonely. [music playing] [crunching leaves] [bird chirping] [gunshot] [grunting] [music playing] [beeping] [typing] Thank you. [beeping] Shit. Mr. Quill? Something strange is happening to my computer terminal. Lisa, just call somebody and have them look at it for you. LISA: Yes sir, it's just that it seems to be locked onto some kind of priority message. Well, tell me what it says. LISA: Priority level one, missing signal property number N1708A, contact reestablished. Hi, Lisa why don't you take a break? Thank you. [phone ringing] [typing] Son of a bitch. This is Quill, is Jack back yet? Well, then send Leo to meet me in tracking, right away. Dump whatever you're working on. Don't be ridiculous, I've been working on this program all morning. I want property tracking on N1708A, now. Yes sir. [typing] Here's the good part, sir. [buzzing] [beeping] [beeping] [fast beeping] [music playing] Hey, Monica, you need some help? Hi Michael. No thanks, I can manage. How's things? Good, I can't complain. Even if I did, nobody would listen to me. Aren't you up here a little early? You know hunting season doesn't start for another three weeks. Yeah, well I figured I'd get a head start on some cleaning. Besides, I promised Billings and Freddie I'd come up early this season. Do they know you're here? They always know when I'm here. I never could figure that out. Would you like a cup of coffee? I'd love one, thank you. I'll be damned. [music playing] Monica, I think you've got some company. [laughing] [kissing] Freddie! Good to see you again, Mike. Billings! Hello Freddie. Don't you hello Freddie me. OK, what did I do wrong this time? It ain't what you did, it's what you didn't do. What? Signs, mister, that's what. You promised to post those no hunting signs near our property, and you haven't posted one yet. Just take it easy, Freddie, I made you a promise, and I'll keep that promise. Come on inside for a second, Freddie. I've got a surprise for you. You'll have to excuse Freddie, Mike. He hasn't had anyone to yell at all winter but me. Oh, that's all right. If he wouldn't yell at me, I'd think the old kook was coming down with something. Look Billings, Monica just bought old Freddie a new hat. Ain't she sweet? She sure is, Freddie. I've got some fresh coffee on the stove, why don't I cook up some ham and eggs for you fellas? That sounds good to me. Sounds great. How about you, Mike, breakfast? Oh, I'd love to baby, but I've got a million and one things to do. Y'all have a good day. Take care of yourself. I do hope one of those you've got to do today is hanging them signs. [printing] Mr. Quill? Leo. Come with me, please. You're probably wondering by now, Leo, why a company like Defsat would spend such a large amount of money to hire a man with your particular experience to do simple security tasks. It's crossed my mind. Well it's very simple. We've been anticipating an event that seems to have finally transpired. As you already know, Defsat Corporation holds all the contracts for the research and development of the Star Wars defense system. These contracts are due to the efforts of one man, Charles Biggums. Two years ago, somebody attempted to assassinate Biggums, he obviously escaped. Now our problem is that no one has seen him or the designs since. Do you think he's in less than friendly hands? No, but I made the decision to keep his disappearance extremely confidential. So nobody knows he's missing? No one. If his disappearance was made public, it would mean the end of Defsat. And I won't let that happen. What's the situation? We finally located the computer disk containing Biggums' designs. I need you to get them, no matter what the expense. Do you have any idea what I should expect to find? This is all the information you will need. Yes sir, that was a fine breakfast, Monica. I'm glad you enjoyed it, Freddie. Any time. You know it's important for a man of my age to get a proper meal, once in a while. You complaining about my cooking again, Freddie? Well, not exactly. Well, maybe if you ask Monica real nice, she'll come up tomorrow night, cook us some dinner. I'd love to. Tomorrow night it is. Come on, Billings, let's get a move on. I'm going to shoot us a wild turkey for tomorrow night's dinner. [laughing] Tomorrow night. I hope these nights feel as well as they did last year. I'm sure they will, Freddie. [ominous music playing] Senator, it's time we started heading back to our designated security area. Well, the deer don't know that. And I'll be damned if I'm given up a twelve point buck for security. Yes sir, we understand, but we do have certain safety precautions to think about. Then you think about them. I'm gonna get that buck. [arrow shooting] [choking] [typing] [beeping] Hey, where's my artillery? Time you showed me the money. Well, we got a problem about that. Shit happens. Guns are expensive. Firing pins are cheap. [gunshots] [laughing] You tell them that if they want to hit me, they'd better send a professional next time, hm? [grunting] I'll tell 'em myself. [grunting] [explosion] You got the money? Yeah. Good girl. [screaming] Police! I didn't do nothing! Shut up! Not bad. This'll get a pretty good price. What kind of cop are you? A bad cop. [gunshot] Good morning. Morning. It looks like the beginning of a beautiful day, doesn't it? Can I help you. Well, that all depends on how well you know these mountains around here. I'm familiar with certain areas. What area are you looking for? I'm looking for an area called Dark Water Canyon. We were told it's ideal for the type of hunting we do. Are you familiar with it? Yes I am. You cross that mountain over there, points yourself south, and travel six, maybe seven miles. Thank you. Whoever told you about Dark Water Canyon forgot to tell you that hunting season doesn't start for another three weeks. Three weeks, is that right? Well, we, wouldn't want to break any laws, would we? We'll just take in some of the sights, thanks again. Shit Leo, how much further do we have to go? What do you got, a lunch date with somebody? Stop breaking my balls, will you? Edwards, we still going south? Still going south, Leo. You think that bitch lied to us? If she did, I'll cut her throat. Look, she said six or seven miles, we've only walked about, what, five? Well, we're not getting any closer sitting on our asses. Let's go. Leo, over here. Looks like somebody beat us to it, there's footprints all over the place. Now what? You find out where these tracks are leading to, you search the plane. [gunshots] What is it? Snake, big one. Relax! Everything's all right. Just search the fucking plane. Leo! These tracks lead to the top of the crevasse. Nothing, a first aid kit and a blanket. Shit. Edwards! You take Peterson and O'Neil and follow those tracks. Check the bodies, see if there's some ID. I'm not touching that asshole. You work for me, you do as you're told. Now do it. [music playing] Well? I'm looking, all right? Bingo, let's go. Hello? Hello? [gunshots] Don't shoot! You could have killed me. No shit, sit down. You alone? Were those your tracks back at the plane? What's your name? Who are you guys? Answer the questions. What is this? I told you guys to follow the tracks. We did, they belong to him. Careful, Leo, he looks a little dangerous. If you say my name once more, I'm gonna blow your face off. Sorry. Did you find a plane back there? Yes, sir. Now, this next question is very important. And if I think you're lying to me, I'm going to have that man put a bullet in your head. Do you understand? Yes, sir. Good. Did you take anything from that plane? No, sir. The little bastards lying. Boy Scouts don't lie, do they? No, sir. I didn't think so. How much time's left before dark? About four hours. OK. You four stay here, you come with me. What's happening? We're going back to the car and report in, we'll be back in the morning. Morning? We'll freeze to death out here without sleeping bags and shit. He's right. Hey, you've got a Boy Scout. Have him build you a fire. [laughing] What an asshole. Mm-hmm. You're up to your ass in it this time, Billings, and you know it. There's an old Taoist saying, Freddie, that attention centers not on things in their state of being, but upon their movements and change. Horse shit. Check mate. What? You're a back shooter, Billings. That's what you did, I left my back door open, you shot me right in the back. Mmm, you smell great. Oh? Mm-hm. Your cooking smells good, too. Two out of three isn't bad. What's number three? You'll find out later. Now if you don't stop kissing my neck, dinner is never going to be ready. Why don't you go in there and cut up those vegetables for me. That should keep those hands of yours busy for a while. That's a lot of vegetables for three people. Oh I forgot, I'm sorry, John. What? I invited Mike up to dinner, I hope you don't mind. - No, not at all. - Are you sure? I should have asked you and Freddie first, I'm sorry. Don't be silly. Mike's welcome here any time. What time did he say he's going to be here? Well, he said he'd be up after he finished posting his no hunting signs for Freddie. Unless he went over to Dark Water Canyon. What would he go down to Dark Water Canyon for? I called Mike this morning about a group of strange men I talked to that wanted to do some hunting up around Dark Water Canyon. When I told them hunting season hadn't started yet, they went up anyway. What do you mean by strange? I don't know, I guess the way they acted. They had a real city way about them. One of them had a .45 under his jacket. I mean, what do you hunt with a .45? [music playing] Hey Boy Scout, you got food in that pack of yours? Yeah. Well fix us something to eat. You got a problem with that? [unzipping] Hey I'm freezing my ass off over here. Put some more wood in the fire. Man what I can do with a nice porterhouse steak, a baked potato, and a cold beer right now. Hey shut up, will you? Hurry up with that food. You know I remember once eating nothing but rat meat and cold rice for three months straight. Why? I was a POW in Vietnam. [cocks gun] You ever eat a rat, boy? You ever eat a rat, boy? No, sir. Hey Boy Scout. What brings you up in these woods, anyway. I'm working on a badge. What kind of badge? Survival batch. It's called the Order of the Eagle. I was a Cub Scout once. I got kicked out, for eating a brownie. [laughing] Now that's good one, I like that one. Huh? You get it, for eating a brownie. [laughing] MIKE: Hello? Hello out there. Put 'em down, put 'em down! Relax. One word out of you, and I'll blow your fucking brains out, understand? - Good evening. - Good evening. Been up here doing a little hunting? No, no. Just doing a little camping, Ranger. Mm. You know there's no camping up here, and that mean no campfire, so put out your fire. What's your name, son? GREG: Greg, sir. You all right, son? Get lost. What did you say? I said get lost. Turn around when you talk to me. I said, turn around! [gunshots] [music playing] My fucking leg! You stupid son of a bitch. [gunshot] [gunshots] [gunshots] Oh! - You see which way he went? - No. Go to the left, you take the right. Fuck. [thud] [gunshots] Got a hit. Logan! Logan! Hey, what are you, deaf? [punch] [thud] LEO: (ON PHONE) Yes sir, we found the plane. Biggums is dead. We didn't find anything in the plane, but I have reason to believe that the Boy Scout did it. I see. Well, that's not very good is it? Where's the Boy Scout now? LEO: (ON PHONE) He's with the rest of my men. He's not going anywhere. Good, see that he doesn't. Now here are your instructions. You are to be at the pickup location in the morning. I will have a man by the name of Jack LaRouse flown in, you will take him to the wreckage, at which point he will take over the operation. Is that clear? LEO: (ON PHONE) Yes, sir. Oh, by the way Leo, Mr. LaRouse is to have full cooperation from you and your men. Am I understood? LEO: (ON PHONE) Yes sir, everything's under control. Good. I'm starving my ass off, standing out here. Are you sure there was no one left in that trading post? I'm positive. [airplane approaching] Well it's about fucking time. [music playing] Jack, Leo. I-- You'll have to excuse my tracker, he's not much of a conversationalist. I'll say. Are you Jack LaRouse? Why, is someone else getting off the airplane? I'm Leo, this is O'Neil. Pleasure. Excuse me, will you? You won't forget what we discussed about the pickup, will you? Well, let's get on with it, shall we? Jack, you might want to know where we're going. Why? My track seems to know already. Don't look at me. [birds chirping] Well, good morning. Welcome back to the living. Where am I? Never mind where you are right now, let's just take a look at that head of yours. You know, you remind me of a little dog I once found, that had been beaten so much, that when you tried to pet it, it tried to bite your hand off. I think a proper introduction is needed here. I'm Freddie. Greg. Now that wasn't so bad, was it? Let's see what we got here. Ah. Easy does it, now. Old Freddie ain't ate a young boy like you for breakfast in a long time. [laughing] GREG: How bad is it? Well, let's put it this way. It ain't nothing a good old breakfast won't fix. You get some rest, while Freddie sees about rustling up some grub. Freddie? Yeah. Thanks. Shit, save you thanks for Billings, he was the one that got you out of that rash of shit last night. [monica humming] Oh, you're up. Good morning. Morning. So you're the one who spoiled my dinner last night. - Sorry. - It's OK, I'm only teasing. Hi, I'm Monica. I'm-- I'm Greg. Do you know where my clothes are? Well, yeah, your pants and your shoes are right here. I'm afraid your shirt had quite a bit of blood on it, but I can get that out. I can find you an old t-shirt to wear in the meantime. OK. Don't worry, I didn't undress you, Freddie did. Thank you. You're welcome. I'll get you a t-shirt. [laughing] O'NEIL: (VOICEOVER) You alone? You alone? Are those your tracks back there? Just answer that questions. Are those your tracks back there? LEO: (VOICEOVER) Now this next question is very important. And if I think you're lying to me, I'm going to have this man put a bullet in your head. MONICA: I found an old t-shirt of Freddie's for you. Greg? Greg? Freddie, run and get Billings, quick. Hey, I think you better get back in here. He's just been standing there, staring. Let me have some time with him. Here, come on, Freddie, let's go get breakfast. - They killed him. - Who? The Ranger, they killed him. OK, relax. No, you don't understand. If they find me, they're going to kill me too. I should have never taken that stupid briefcase from that plane. We've got to call the police. There's no phones here. What? I got to get out of here. - Take it-- No, I got to go! Let me go! Listen to me! Running around in an area that you don't know isn't the smartest thing to do right now, is it? Is it? No, but if they find me, they're going to kill me. Hey! Who saved your ass last night? You did. Yeah. And I'm not about to let anything happen to you now. OK? Why don't you tell me how you got yourself into all this trouble. Come on. While you're over there, loosen that tourniquet. What do I look like, a nurse? What's so funny? The look on Leo's face when you tell him a Boy Scout took us down. You got a real stupid sense of humor, you know that? Hello Greg, have a seat. I hope you like eggs. How would you like your eggs this morning, John? Oh, I won't be eating this morning, thanks. I'll be back in a while. Would it be too much for me to ask where you're going? Yes, it would. Can I expect you for lunch? You bet. Come on. Excuse me. Billings. Look, Freddie. Look, Freddie, my ass. Where the hell you get off leaving me in the dark when there's trouble? There's no time to explain right now. Bullshit. Either you tell me, or I'm going in and getting my gun and go with you. All right. The men that were after Greg last night may still be out there. I want to know where they are. I need you here. Have a gun ready, just be ready to move out if we have to. You get your ass back here in one piece, do you understand? I plan to. [music playing] [beeping] Come on. Did you hear that? What? It better be Leo. Maybe it's that Boy Scout, come back to get us. Relax, it's him. What the fuck happened to him? Where's the boy? He got away last night. He what? Excuse me. It wasn't our fault, Leo. A ranger showed up to the campsite last night, he had to be dealt with. Bastard tried to kill Johnson, so I shot him. That's when the kid got away. And just like that, you let him get away. We ran after him all right, but there was somebody out there waiting. What the fuck is he talking about? It's no bullshit, Leo. Whoever they were, they tore into us like a shark. Yeah but the kid isn't going to get far on his own, we found blood. It was a definite hit. This is great. Leo, you are certain this is the scientist. Yeah, it's him, all right. I've got his ID in my pocket. Who is this guy, Leo? My name is Jack LaRouse, and I'm taking charge of this operation. From here on, you will be taking your instructions from me. Is that clear? Is that right, Leo? That's what the man said, isn't it? And now, if you'll be so kind as to show me where it was that you lost the boy. You think you can make it back to the cabin? I think so. Well, tell Freddie and Monica to get everything ready, because they're gonna have to move out. All right? - OK. Go. [music playing] What are we gonna do with Johnson? My tracker will see to it that he's made comfortable. We'll pick him up on our way back. Get me out of these fucking mountains. It won't be long. Logan, you lead the way. [grunting] This is where we lost sight of them. So you got a hit? We did. There's more leading in that direction. And where was it that you were attacked last night? About 25 yards over there. Edwards went right, I went left. Track. [music playing] Where's Billings? He's watching those men. I'll get my gun and you show me where he is. No, he told us to pack up and get ready to move. Damn. What's going on? Billings wants us to pack up. That bad, huh? I guess so. Here, I got the blood out and it's almost dry. Thank you. No, that's OK, you keep it. You might need it. Monica, you get the packs, and I'll get my gun from the shed. OK. Greg, you get the shells from the mount. How many do you think there were? Couldn't have been more than three. [music playing] Do you know what those are? Yeah, they're Purple Heart medals. Are they yours? No, they're Billings', they were given to him in Vietnam. How'd he get them? I'll tell you that story another time. Come on, let's get those shotguns loaded. How many? Five men, well what do you expect? I don't think you understand. My tracker indicated five, that included the three of you and the Boy Scout. That leaves one. That's bullshit, Leo, no one guy's gonna take us out. It's quite obvious, Mr. Logan, that you are not qualified to make that affirmation, now are you? Are you sure he's not making a mistake? A mistake has already been made, last night, Leo. All right. I don't want to discuss this anymore. Let's just find the kid, and get this shit over with. I believe it's this way. Freddie? Why do you think Billings come up here to live? To get away from all the bullshit. See Greg, up here you ain't got nobody to answer to but yourself. Down there, you got a whole world of assholes, trying to tell you what to do, how to do it, when to do it. And if you don't do it, you ain't got the rent. Living like that will make you old before you die, and that's a fact. You listen to old Freddie. [music playing] You and Billings been friends a long time, huh? Billings and my boy used to raise hell together when they were teenagers. Where's your boy now? Dead. Died in some rice paddy, that lousy Asian war. Billings is the one that brought my boy's body home. Never forget the day we buried him-- cold, raining, and Billings standing there with his uniform on, three Purple Hearts. He was a hero, huh? Yes he was. Captured three times, escaped three times. Freddie, he's been gone a long time. Don't you worry about Billings. MIKE: Canteen's full and I'm working on a pack. You a good shot? [gunshot] [music playing] Freddie, Billings is back! What's happening? We're getting the hell out of here, is what's happening. Where we going to? You know those big rocks we found last spring? The ones by the lake? I want the three of you to go over there and wait for me. What are you planning to do? I've got to buy a little time. I don't suppose you'd want me to go with you. I do not. I didn't think so. Ya! How much did you pack? Enough for three days. You want me to pack more? No, I don't have time. OK. If we need food, I can catch rabbits with this. Can I stay and help? No, I'll be there soon enough. Well, Greg, let's get a shake on. I'll see you soon? Yeah. Go. That, gentlemen, is your night stalker. Let's see how he does during the day. Excuse me. I was hoping perhaps that you could help us. Depends on what it is. First off, let me introduce myself. I'm Jack LaRouse, you are? John Billings. We've already met. I believe we have. Lower That rifle, mister, or use it. There's no need for that, Mr. Peterson, I think Mr. Billings understands the potential of the situation. Now then, if you'd be so kind as to tell us the whereabouts of the Boy Scout? Sent him in that direction on a horse. That wasn't very good of you, Mr. Billings. Well, it seemed like the thing to do at the time. If you'll excuse me, I've got some work to do. You're gonna let him walk away like that? Relax Mr. Peterson, everything is under control. Mr. Billings! Jack, what the hell is going on? Leo, would you bring Mr. Billings back outside please? O'Neil. [crashing] [music playing] [gunshot] [gunshots] [cocking gun] He's only got a fucking Winchester, let's rush him. [gunshot] Splendid idea, Mr. Edwards, be my guest. We gonna sit around all day and play with this asshole or what? We're going rush this son of a bitch! Now! [gunshots] [crashing] [gunshots] He went out the back window, he's got a briefcase! [gunshots] [grunting] [groaning] [gunshots] [gunshots] [gunshots] [splashing] [gunshots] All right, cut it. Hold your fire, damn it! He's not coming up. Where the hell is he? He's dead, he's got to be dead. Oh, you think so? This guy don't got to be nothing. This is just beautiful, Leo. No Boy Scout, no mountain man, nothing. Not a fucking thing. JACK LAROUSE: We should look elsewhere, gentlemen. I really don't think he'll be coming up here. No shit, Sherlock. Shut up. Which way, Jack? Is your bloodhound still with us? [music playing] Indeed, he is. Indeed my ass. How long do you think we'll have to stay here? Well, that all depends on what Billings finds out about those men. We'll be all right. There's plenty of fresh water, and enough food to last us for at least three days. If we're lucky, maybe Freddie will catch some rabbits, and make us some of his rabbit stew. Right, Freddie? He's taking too long. I don't like it. No sir, not one bit. Freddie, why don't you come over here and keep us company? John will be here soon enough. Yeah, come on, Freddie. He's in trouble, I can feel it. And I'm standing like some old woman watching her laundry dry. I'm going after him. Freddie, John told us to wait here for him. That's right, Freddie. Well he ain't here. And if he does need my help, I'm gonna shoot some son of a bitch. Freddie, don't wander too far. So stubborn sometimes. Make me leave my home, I'll blow that damn fool's brain's out. [gunshot] [gunshot] Show your face, you silly little bastard. Drop the shotgun, or I'll blow your brains all over these woods. Now. Somebody's coming. Where's Freddie? He went looking for you. He what? I told him to stay here. That's what we told them, but he wouldn't listen. You know how he gets. I'll go get him. No, you stay put. Those men will be combing this are in no time. They won't be able to find us here. Don't bet on that. I knew they weren't hunters. Oh, they're hunters, all right. How long's Freddie been gone? 10 minutes. OK, I'm going to try to go and find Freddie before they do. Is there anything I can do? Yeah, hold onto these, be ready to move out. I don't think we're gonna be staying here very long. [music playing] I tell you, man, I'm living up here by myself. That's not what these tracks say, old man. Damn it, Freddie. He's back. Oh no. Where's Freddie? - They've got him. - We've got to save him. We're not gonna do it staying here. Leave everything but the shotguns, we've got to move fast, let's go. Leo, have some of your men circle out about 70 yards or so, just in case. Peterson, you and Edwards. No need, they're not going anywhere without their friend. Mr. Billings! I know you're watching. You won't keep us waiting long, now, will you? How many men do you see down there? - Five. - There were seven before. Where are the other two? That's a good question. How are we going to get Freddie out of there? | don't know, but it's not going to be easy. How fast can you run? Fast. Good, because the Ranger's station is a mile east from here. I want you and Greg to make a run for it while I try to get Freddie out of that cave. So that's what you were trying to do, you were going to have them chase us right to the Ranger. Yeah, well it seemed like a good idea at the time. What are you going to do? I'm gonna see if I can't draw them out of that cave. Knock them off one by one like Rambo? Like who? You know, Rambo. The guy who runs through the jungle and kills the enemy. There were guys in Nam like that, right? Yeah. What are they called? Dead. Well, this ought to be high enough. Yeah, I'll stay here. Why don't you go check some lower ground. Man, I can't wait to get back to the city. Hey, Peterson, you got an extra clip? I'm a little low. There's no such thing as an extra clip. Thanks, asshole. Don't mention it. Mr. Billings! Time is running out! For every 10 minutes that I wait, your friend inside will suffer considerably, starting now! Listen to me, both of you. I'm gonna run in that direction. When those two men open fire at me, you'll know where they are. That's when you run for the Ranger's, understand? Now Greg, I want you to stay a ways back from Monica, that way you can cover her back, OK? Yeah. Good. Give me the disks. Now, Freddie's life depends on this, you ready? [music playing] [gunshots] [gunshots] [gunshot] Drop the weapon. Well, if it's not the trading post lady. Where'd you think you were going? To get some help, huh? Are you OK? I'm fine. Run, Greg. Yeah, well, what about you? There's not enough time, run! You got the guts to pull that trigger? Don't take another step. Shotguns are awfully messy. You pull that trigger, you're gonna splatter me all over this forest. You want to see that? Yeah, I didn't think so. [gunshot] [grunting] [grunting] [gunshots] Hey Tracker, you want to eat? I've never seen him eat, nor sleep. He doesn't speak much either. I think you'd find it difficult talking without a tongue, don't you think, Leo? Leo, what time is it? 3:30, why? Not long before our pickup time. Uh, Jack, 10 minutes is up. I'm sorry to hear that. So what are you going to do with the old nigger? I never cared much for that expression. Neither have I. My mistake. Very nice. Very nice, indeed. Where did you get it? I made it. I commend you on your craftsmanship. I, too, am an admirer of the cutlery weapons. Do you like it, Freddie? No. Seems that your friends don't care that much about you, do they? [groaning] Hang in there, Freddie. [groaning] [grunting] Is the old man dead? Is that a conscience I hear? No, I was just wondering how our ace in the hole was doing, that's all. The pilot's on the walkie talkie, he wants to know the location of the pickup. Thank you. [groaning] [music playing] [groaning] Are you ready for another session, Freddie? LOGAN: This is a bunch of bullshit, Leo. We're wasting time. LEO: Jack. Yes? LEO: We've tried this before. It's not getting us anywhere. Leo's right. We've got 12 minutes before the pickup, Jack. Perhaps you have something more persuasive in mind for getting Mr. Billings to come down. I do. [music playing] Billings! This is your last chance! I want the boy and the briefcase down here now, or I'm going to put a bullet in this old man. You've got three minutes, starting now. Do you hear me, Billings? [gunshot] Give me the gun. Give me it. Leo! O'Neil? Don't shoot, we're coming in. You owe me one, Leo. I stopped him from putting a bullet in your head just now. [smack] What are you doing? - That was for last night. That'll be enough, Mr. Logan. I found Edwards, too. He was hanging upside down in a tree with a bullet in him. [grunting] - You've been busy. Your tracker's dead, too. [grunting] Search him. I'll take those, thank you. We got what we came for, let's get rid of these two, and get the hell out of here. Where's the boy? He's dead, one of your men shot him. Why don't you show me where the body is? Suit yourself. Forget it, Jack. If we're not at that pickup site when the pilot gets there, he's going to leave without us. I suppose you're right, Leo. Why don't you and your men leave for the plane now. I'll be there shortly. Whatever you say Jack, just don't be late. [music playing] This way, please. There it is. I can't wait to get the hell outta these mountains. No shit. That'll be far enough, thank you. Friendly little asshole, isn't he? That thing's kind of small for eight men. You're right. What the f-- [gunshots] Your turn. Got any last words? Who do you really work for, LaRouse? That all depends. I suppose one could call me a custom-approved representative, of shall we say, a country with opposing political views. At the moment, these disks are worth a great deal. On your knees, Mr. Billings. No. Very well, good bye, Mr. Billings. [gunshots] Drop it, mister. [gunshot] Freddie! It's all over, you're going to be all right. Where's Monica? Monica. RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Quill, the FBI is here to see you. I'll be out in a moment. [music playing] [gunshot] [music playing] To get away from all the bullshit. I thought I saw somebody come in here. Monica. I've been wondering when you'd show up. It's been a while. I know. After the hearing, my mother sent me to Europe to live with my sister for a while. Where are they? They went away, higher into the mountains. I feel like it's all my fault. Some things happen for a reason, Greg. You can't change that. You think you'll ever see them again? Yeah. How do you know? They always seem to know when I'm here. I never could figure that one out. Come on, let's go for a walk.
