Tomisaburo WAKAYAMA Never forget your obligations. Always be a support to your boss. Directed by: Kosaku YAMASHITA Never forget your obligations. Always be a support to your boss. Directed by: Kosaku YAMASHITA THE BEGINNING OF THE SHOWA ERA, NAOETSU You sure don't have much guts for someone who says they're Jirocho's boys. What? I was waiting for you. Come on! Get him! Shi-chan... This is a gift from that man... Is he here? Yes, hurry. Go out there to see him. I'll watch that. Can you share that with everyone? For me? I'll treasure this. Do you like the ocean? Yes. I was born in the mountains of Fukushima Prefecture. Did you want to join the theater troupe? I was adopted by the troupe leader when I was little. My family are poor farmers. I'm sorry for asking... How about you? I'm from Tokyo. What do you do? What do I look like I do? Are you a stockbroker? Or a fishmonger? I'm sorry. I guess it doesn't really matter. To Tokyo? There's something I need to take care of. I won't be able to see you again... We're going to Sado tomorrow. When... ...and where will we be able to see each other again... Shizu... I neither work for a stockbroker nor a fishmonger. I'm not that respectable. Can you just remember the name Seijiro Aikawa? No! I don't want just your name. Will you be my wife? But... ...My real life... Don't say anything. I just need your name. Just leave without saying anything. If you tell me where you are and what you're doing, I won't be able to hold myself back. I'm responsible to support the Nakamura Theater Troupe. I can't ever be someone's wife. I just want this one day. If you see our sign in another city again, please stop in to see our play. I can't do that. We're already husband and wife. My life isn't something I can boast about, but would you be willing to wait for a year and believe in me and come back here to Naoetsu this time next year? I'll think about how to take care of the troupe at that time and ask for your hand in marriage. Would that be all right? Are you serious? I promise I'll be back. I'm so happy- I'll be so happy if that happens. I'll come back here. I'll be sure to be back here. Who are you? I'm from the Iwai Group. Are you Amano of the Shinjikai? Could you come with me for a minute? I'm sure you know what today is. The 10th of January is a festive day for the Iwai Group. Are you making a ruckus knowing what day it is? Get out of here immediately and I'll pretend this never happened. We need to survive, too. I came here alone because I didn't want this to become a brawl. You're not going to listen? The defendant will be sentenced to five years. I'm so happy- I'll be sure to be back here. Shizu, I'm sorry. Please forget about me. That would be best for you. This money is the most I can do for you. Please use this to become a good wife and find happiness. I wish you the best. TWO YEARS LATER TOKYO OMORI Shizuka, would you consider dismantling the troupe and taking on a patron? He lost his wife and is willing to marry you as long as you're all right with it. That gift is from that man. He offered to refer you to a good hospital for your father as soon as he heard about his illness. Refer my father to a hospital? Koyan-san... Please don't talk to her about such things. Please leave. Father... Please pay a visit to him when you make a decision. How are you? This is unusual for you to come here. Did something happen? The Iwai group is fine. The other leaders have stepped in for you and we're solid as ever. We're going to be busy soon with the Omori landfill. I see. I'm relieved. I'll be able to request for early parole in six months. I see. Hang in there. The reason why I'm here today... It's a pretty funny story... I found someone and I was wondering if it's all right with you if I marry her. Is that all? That's all up to you. Yes, but I should discuss it with you. Everyone will be happy if there's a lady of the house. You think so? She's a pretty strong woman for her age. What did she do before? She's an actress. She was a part of a travelling troupe. I'm sure you wouldn't know her even if I told you her name, but it's Shizuka Nakamura. I call her Shizue now. Have you heard of her? No... I've never heard of her. We will have a grand ceremony later, but today we just wanted to have a private ceremony with the Sakurada group. Sir, could you say a few words? Congratulations on your marriage. I want you all to support them by bringing life to the group. Iwai, why don't you say a few words, too. She's a novice at this, so please take care of her. Kanji, why don't you say a few words, too. Sir... Ma'am... Congratulations. That's Kanji, one of the leaders. The men here are our immediate subordinates. I hope you can eventually learn everyone else's names. I am pleased to meet you all. It's a little lonely without Seijiro. Seijiro is absent right now because he's serving his time right now, but he's the leader of the younger members. Seijiro? Seijiro Aikawa. He's one of my subordinates. I realize the correct way to do things would be to talk to the Sakurada group, but I was hoping you could talk to them. No problem. I hear the Iwai group is the only reason why the Sakurada group is still around. These are the details of the landfill construction. I hope you can be of support to them. Is that the Omori landfill? No one told me anything. It's a job that came directly to you, so you should take care of it on your own. Sir, I took this job on for the Sakurada Group. I apologize if there were any misunderstandings. Don't worry about me. You exchanged vows with the late boss and Omori was an island that you created. It's none of my business. Please come by and show face at the site. It's been settled as a temporary employment, so could you relay that to everyone? Thanks. Kanji... Tell them there will be absolutely no fighting. Sir, I have good news. I just heard that Brother will be let out on parole soon. Seijiro? I see, he's coming home. I want you to prepare for a welcome-home party. I don't care how much you spend. The Tokuno's are living in his old house, right? I'll let them know right away. It's all right. I'll take a look... See! Come on... I quit. It can't be helped. I have more skills than you. That'll be 4 yen and 50 sen. Put it on my tab. You're such a poor loser. Can you just pay up? You're my wife! What are you talking about, old lady? Gambling and marriage are two different things. You're a gambler and you don't even know that? What are you saying? Who do you think you owe this life to, you old hag. Who was it that begged me to marry him? Why can't you speak in the Tokyo dialect? What? What are you doing? How dare you complain when you can't even pay your debts! I can't pay you because I have no money! That's enough! I'm going out. What are you doing? I said I don't have any money. I'm really going to get mad! Cut it out! Sir... Can you refrain from fighting in someone else's house? I'm sorry. Seijiro will be coming home soon. Brother is? He'll be back after having a rough time. Can you please clean the place up and welcome him home? Did you put all his things away for him? Yes. It's over here. Please come inside. I'm sorry it's a little messy. This is it. SHIZUKA NAKAMURA We're celebrating the upcoming parole for our brother. Drink up. It's my treat tonight. Why don't you have a drink, too? I've already started... We are obligated to Seijiro. I'm so excited, I have to have a drink. I'll have another. If he didn't rescue me when I messed up in Osaka, we would both be dead by now. Me, too. I would be dead or in prison by now if he didn't rescue me from my rebellious days. Young lady, I'll treat you to a drink. I see you here often. You should think about stop working at night. How about some oden? Eat up and get some energy. Thank you. Thank you. Emi... It's all been set up. You'll be staying over. I want to go home tonight. You'll be staying over. Please finish that at least. We're running a business. Why can't you just let her eat? She's my woman. Stay out of this. Hey... Where are you from? I'm with the Shinjikai. You're in the Iwai territory. You should refrain from treating women badly here! Bro, What's going on? The Iwai group is interfering with our business. Trying to act like a hero! Slop! You can't do that! You idiot! Didn't I tell you not to make a ruckus before this important job? What don't you understand? Kanji! That's enough. I'll take full responsibility. I'll be sure to punish him. You fool! Takeshi. You shouldn't cut your finger for your own mess. Stop being foolish. Sir... I'm sorry! Sir! Shinjikai seems to be laying low. Kanji... I want you to come with me to settle this with them. But... I don't think you should have to go there to do that. This is an important time. I don't want any problems. All right. I'll go with you. Good evening. I'm Amano of the Shinjikai. I'm very humbled that you would come out here for something small like this. Could you use this to take care of his wounds? I would like you to forget about what happened tonight. You don't have to do this. I was thinking of going over to apologize to you. I'm glad you understand. Please don't rush. There's something I'd like to discuss with you since you're here. What is it? I was hoping you could help the Shinjikai... Amano, don't get carried away. I'm just saying I want us to get along. We lost one of our boys last year in that incident with Aikawa and I do have boys who will want to seek revenge now that he's being released. Amano... your boys were able to do business here in Omori because I turned a blind eye to you. If you don't get that, I don't mind cleaning this whole place up. Father, he's going to be released soon. What should I do? Shi-chan! Suzume! I was in the area, so I thought I'd visit your father's grave. I'm sure he'll be happy. I'm so jealous. You're the Madam of the Iwai Group. My husband is just a drunk gambler. He uses my earnings all for his gambling. What group is he with? He works alone. Well, that's what he says. I heard there's a man named Seijiro Aikawa in the Iwai Group. How did you know that? I heard from my husband. Is it the same man you met in Naoetsu? It's a totally different person. Suzume, I have a favor... Could you forget about Naoetsu? I don't even want to think about those days. This isn't much, but please use it for something. Thank you. Please promise me about Naoetsu. Your long lost love... We can't ignore how the Iwai group has been acting lately. He hasn't even come to pay his respects to me when his group is doing a job right in front of me. Vendors lately don't have any manners. How dare they go directly to the Iwai group without coming to us first. Not to mention Iwai who just accepts the work without any hesitation. We should be wary of our subordinates doing better than the main group. Sir, I think it's best if you put an end to all of this. Omori is becoming a prime spot for development. We'll be answering to Iwai eventually if we don't do something. I'm not that ignorant. Just wait and see. Is there something you want to talk to me about? Why? Because we're all alone here. Why not? I have to take care of you, too. It's not that I don't have anything to talk to you about. I'm thinking about retiring when Seijiro comes back and have him take over the group. I was 30 and he was 18 when the Iwai group first established in this area. We did it together. He's struggled so much and I haven't done much to help him. The least I could do is hand over the reigns to him and live somewhere quietly with you. Is that all right with you? Yes. Let's do that. Could you hang in there until then? Is Mr. Iwai here? Who's there? Boss! Dear! Shizue... I won't make it. You do what you want to do with your life. Forget about me... Dear! Tell Seijiro to complete the job for me. And... ...that I was a foolish Boss... Thank you very much. Brother is home! Bro! Kanji! Brother... It must have been rough. This is the leader of the Iwai Group, Seijiro Aikawa. Brother... I've just returned. He asked you all to be sure to complete the job for the landfill. He wanted to give you a huge welcome home party. It's become so lonely. I'm sorry for not preventing this. I'll take responsibility for all of this. Kanji, let's not say that anymore. I just want to thank you all for your loyalty. Brother, we're sure it was someone from the Shinjikai. I'm the cause of all of this. Let me take care of this. Me, too. I understand how you feel, but it's as she says... ...We need to finish the work that he started. Don't get into any trouble with the Shinjikai until I'm prepared to do so. Let's drink. Congratulations. Could you come and see me later? Please forgive me. I was a fool. I should have believed in you and waited as many years as I needed to. I found out who you were for the first time after marrying into this family. Please don't say anymore. I'm the one who broke our promise. No one will understand. Please forget it ever happened. Who... Iwai. The boss? What did he say? He said to tell you that he was a foolish boss. I don't want to stay here. I can't stay here. I want to live by myself once this is over. Please let me do that. I don't want you to see me like this. The other members are watching your every move. Could you let me handle this? Will you understand? I do. Seijiro... You do understand? The only issue is the project that Iwai had accepted. I'm sure you're in a bind now. I discussed it with everyone and we decided that the Sakurada Group will take care of everything until Iwai's services are over. Is that all right? Sir... we thank you very much, but we have a very good leader. We won't cause any problems for you with the Omori project. Who's your leader? Aikawa. Seijiro, this job will reflect on the Sakurada group, too. Do you have enough confidence not to screw anything up? Gentlemen... ...I just returned from serving my sentence and I'm still very young within the Sakurada group. But, we have Boss Iwai's wife. We would like to support her and overcome this. Please watch over us. That's great, but she hasn't been in this industry very long. I think it would be in her best interest not to send her out into the world. She's not like that. She's prepared. We won't get anywhere with you answering for her. Madam, how do you feel? You can still go back to being a commoner. It'll be too late once we announce you as the leader to everyone. Nothing good ever came out of a commoner leading the group. Sir... ...Isn't that going too far? What? It seems... ...we've said some unnecessary things. Bro, I'll see them out. I think they're underestimating us a little too much. The late boss wasn't getting along with the new chairman. We just have to make sure they can't criticize anything we do. Shinjikai is the problem. I can help you if you want to get even. It's not just Shinjikai. There may be more dirty rats out there. Kanji, I'm counting on you to help me out. Bro, you should know! would always help you. I'm ready to sacrifice my life for you anytime. She's here again... Takeshi, is that her? You idiot. Are you in love with her? She's in love with me. That's all. It's all right. It's not all right. You're such a hopeless fool. Sir, this is Mr. Aikawa. Please... I've heard a lot about you from Iwai. I'm counting on you. Thank you. Mr. Aikawa, you have a phone call. Hello? The Madam? She asked me to give this to you and left early this morning. Where did she go? I don't know. I realize I'm being selfish, but there's only one option for me to choose. I am prepared. Please forgive me for being inconsiderate. Shizu, you must not die. Shizu... you must not die. Seijiro... Seijiro... Seijiro! I'm so glad. I couldn't die. I just couldn't do it. What should I do? Please come home. No! Ma'am. No! I don't want you to call me that forever. Please listen to me. We don't know when the Sakurada group will go against our group. You're our only hope to protect the Iwai name. I don't want to go home! I'm just a normal woman. Please let me stay that way! Seijiro... Please run away with me. Run away? Somewhere no one can find us. Just the two of us. That's my only option. Please take me. You're the only one for me. I don't care if we are an embarrassment. I don't care if they kill us. That's my only choice. Please... Ma'am... Once this project is over, I'll reconsider your request. Please just come home with me this time. Is the Iwai family that important to you? Ma'am... That's the only family I have. You're not going to listen to my request? You don't want to? Then please die here. You're the only one for me. If that's what you want me to do, then that's what I'll do. I'll become the woman you want me to be. You're making me do this. You fool. Who gave you permission to put this up? The Iwai group gave us the permission. Iwai? There's no one by that name in the Shinjikai. Clean it up immediately. Stop! You're with the Shinjikai, aren't you? Let me hear what you have to say. I don't have anything to say to you. I'll take you on if you want to fight. Did Amano order you to do this? I don't know... Tell Amano to come and pick him up. I'm sorry for the trouble. Thank you very much. Take him away. Kinbara. I paid you big money to take down Aikawa. How dare you come back here when he's still alive and kicking? Stop getting so upset. I went all the way to Naoetsu while I was chasing after him and saw something interesting. What's so interesting? I'm saying you have a better hand with him alive than dead. It took me a while to do some research on that. What did you find? How much are you willing to pay me for it? Don't get carried away! Let me tell you this... I have no intentions of being friendly with you guys. I'm risking my life for the money. My wife is involved in the story in Naoetsu, too. I'm sorry for calling you out. It's fine, but can we make this the last time? Aren't you the Madam of the Iwai group? I'm Amano, of the Shinjikai. What do you want? We heard stories about your days in Naoetsu from her. Suzume! Please forgive me. I didn't plan on any of this, but... I understand the wife of the boss of the Iwai group had a relationship with one of his subordinates. Not just that... I also heard you both went on a getaway to Naoetsu just recently, too. What do you think would happen if this rumor spread? We can forget about it if you're willing to listen to our conditions. I don't know what she told you, but I don't have anything I should be ashamed of. Go ahead and do as you please. I'll be prepared for anything. Are you sure? A friend of mine is still seeking revenge against Aikawa. He's planning to settle things one day, but I can have him forget about that depending on your answer. I'm not trying to pick a fight. I would like to work together with you folks. What do you say? Could you start by letting my boy that you're holding hostage back to me? All right. I'll be waiting. Who told you to do this? I don't know. That's enough. We need to settle things with Shinjikai or it'll ruin our reputation. I'll go and settle this. You don't need to go. Let me do this. It's something I need to settle myself. I want you to gather the young ones and be prepared for the worst. Seijiro... Let that boy go... Ma'am, we want to settle this score with Shinjikai. Could you let me handle this? Just let them be. Stop making a fuss over a bunch of rebellions. Yes, but the men at the site are being inconvenienced. That doesn't mean I'm going to let you start a fight over it. Seijiro... Are you saying you can't listen to me? Not at all... Please tell everyone not to do anything to the Shinjikai in the future. Bro, what should we do? She's a novice at this. Just ignore her. You fool! We have to do as she says. Good evening! Tell me the truth and I'll let you go... What did you talk to Shizue about today? Bro... What is it? I have something I need to talk to you about. What is it? Please don't get upset. I would never get upset with you. I would like the Madam to leave. Why? Don't ask me why. Or else our reputation will be damaged. It's not just that. We won't be able to protect our territory. Kanji... Be honest with me. Is there something you have against her? Bro... Are you going to make me say this? I don't know what it is. Didn't you have a relationship with her when she was still with the troupe? I heard everything. Kanji... Who told you that? An old actress friend of hers. She's being used by the Shinjikai. Shinjikai is using that against her. That explains why she was acting that way yesterday. I... ...believe in you. I want to believe her, too. But... ...We'll be at a disadvantage if you both live under the same roof. We can't go up against Shinjikai unless we ask her to step down. Kanji... I understand how you feel. But, she's not the same person I had a relationship with four years ago. She's the Boss' replacement right now. Supporting her is my only way of giving back to the boss since I wasn't there to see him one last time. Kanji, please believe her. Let me ask you this. How do you explain Madam going to Naoetsu? Someone from the Shinjikai saw the both of you there. What did she want to talk to you about? Was it something she could say at the house? Kanji, please don't talk about that now. Once this job is done, I'll tell you everything. Please just trust her until then and forget about everything. That's not going to go over well with everyone. I'm telling you this because I don't want your name to be brought to shame. I can't risk my life for a group with that kind of reputation. Kanji, so you're telling me you can't listen to me? Yes. I don't understand you at all. How do you really feel about her? Are you in love with her or not? You would be able to tell her to leave if you have no regrets. If you do, then you should leave this life with her no matter how much you're shamed. I can't stand anyone who can't make a decision. You... Kanji... If you just won't listen to me, then... ...go ahead and stab me. Go ahead. All right. Do whatever you want. But, the Iwai group will crumble without me. Kanji... it seems you're not doing too well. Use that. He got drunk and took a fall. He got drunk and died. Hey. Were you drinking again? What do you think of this kimono? Did we have this at the pawn shop? Don't be silly! The Madam made this for me for the New Years. It's so nice to have a Madam around. Mine is quite the masculine one. Well, my man is physically big, but has no authority. He's never even bought me a kimono. I'll make you one. But why don't you get reborn as a pretty woman who matches a kimono. What? Help! What happened? He's going to kill me. I asked if I could rest since I wasn't feeling well, but he refused. What should we do? I thought I would find you here. Give me back my woman. Isn't she for sale? I'll buy her for tonight. You idiot! We don't take yakuza as customers. Get out of here! Don't let him get away! Kill him! Are you running away? I'll kill you! How many did you stab? I only know of one. I'll take any punishment. Brother, me, too. All right. We can't change what happened. We fell right into their trap. We can't go back now. I want you all to be prepared. Hide... Go and get Kanji. Masa... Yasu... I want you to check on Shinjikai. I want the rest of you to get the tools ready. Wait! We'll lose if we wait around. We need to attack now. No, I'll go over there and settle this. Ma'am, we can't let them take advantage of us. We have our limits. Sei... Have you forgotten the boss' last words to finish the landfill project? Sony about this. Don't mention it. They'll be coming from Yokohama, too. Sir, you have a call from Sakurada. Hello, this is Amano. It's me. I heard. I have an idea. Just leave the rest to me. Don't do anything rash. All right? Yes, I'll leave the rest up to you. Ma'am, please just let me go there. Please. Sei, you can't get into a fight. I know about the Shinjikai blackmailing you. Ma'am... We have nothing to be ashamed of. We need to stop Shinjikai in order to prove we have nothing to hide. Sei... That's not all there is. Your life is at risk... Ma'am, the Sakurada group is willing to mediate this matter. Would you let them handle this? Kanji, did you ask them to? Everyone knows about it. This issue has to do with the Iwai Group. This is not an issue for the main group to step in. Seijiro, the Shinjikai are gathering rebels from Tokyo and Yokohama. How are you planning to get through this without any backup? The Madam should decide that. Kanji... Sir... Ma'am, could you make a decision? Kanji... Come with me. Kanji... I don't want to owe the Sakurada group over something like this. Once we make a debt, we can't repay him just with money. It's extremely expensive. We have to settle this amongst ourselves. I thought I told you I would do it my way. Kanji, are you going against me? I just want to protect the Iwai name. Let me ask you this... Do you have any idea how to settle this peacefully? There are rumors about you and the Madam going around. Are you confident you can do it? I'm putting everything out there for you. I want you to break that sake cup if you don't like the way I do things. Is everyone here? Thank you very much. We'll split the compensation 50-50. Is that all right? Yes. I'm not asking you. Kanji, is that all right? Yes. Seijiro, let me be clear. It still hasn't been definitely decided that you'll be the successor. Please stay out of this today. Excuse me, but what do you mean by that? You've got into a fight with Amano before. Sir, that has nothing to do with this. Don't talk back to me! Who is responsible for all of this trouble that we're going through anyway? Isn't it you? How dare you talk back to me like that. We can't have you being a leader after all that's happened. Kanji, I want you to handle things today. Sir... What? You have complaints against that mediator? You are right. Kanji, I'm leaving it up to you. Bro... That's absurd! Go back there. No! Go back! Bro... What was that all about? What are you talking about? Aikawa is the leader of the Iwai Group. How dare you go along with what the chairman said and ignoring Aikawa. And you call yourself a man? I have my own way of doing things. Who cares! Takeshi! Stop! Takeshi, stop! Get out of here. Takeshi... I hope you're prepared... Bro... I feel the same as Takeshi. I want you to kill me, too, if you want to settle this. Me, too! You idiot! Takeshi... This is your sake cup. You're banned as of today! Brother... Brother, please forgive him. You stay out of this! I won't forgive anyone that goes against the boss. Do you understand? Take him home... Let's go... We can't do that... Boss... What do you want? I need to speak to Amano. We've settled everything. Go on home. Amano... I'll repay her debt. Let me clear it. What? It's fine. I should agree to this since we've settled everything, but I can't do it if it's you. You owe me for what you did four years ago. How about you pay that debt first. What do you want me to do? Why don't you get on your hands and knees and apologize? Amano... Forgive me. You fool... I'm not letting you take my business tool away from me. Amano... I just want to hear one answer. I'll take your head with me if I don't hear that answer. Seijiro, are you trying to bring shame to me? Sir, I'll settle this matter with you later. Amano, what's your answer? So you're all right with it? Everything happens for a reason. Don't hold any grudges and turn over a new leaf. That's right, Takeshi. Who is it? Emi... Takeshi... Bro, what are you planning to do with Emi? Takeshi, I settled the debt with Shinjikai just now. Her home is in Nagasaki. I want you to go there and turn over a new leaf. Bro... It's not much, but please accept it. Please turn him into a respectable man. Yes. Bro... I'm so happy !' Yo"- Could you two see them off before they start to come after them? Let's go. Let's go. I don't have any way of thanking you. This was my mother's... Thank you. I'll never forget this. Seijiro... Madam, this is my one and only request. Please allow me to have my sake cup back. Stay out of this. Ma'am... The Sakurada group will come to settle what I did tonight. This is for the sake of the Iwai group. Please... Kanji... Will you understand? It's for her to decide. I can't say anything. Seijiro, I can't accept this. Ma'am, I broke rules of this world. Please understand. This is my apology to Boss Sakurada. Please settle everything with the main house with this. Boss, please forgive me. Ma'am... thank you for everything. Kanji... Take care of everything. I want you all to take care of the Madam and the leader. Seijiro! Are you leaving me? Ma'am... I've made my decision. I finally understand your way of life. I'll plant my roots here in the Iwai family and become the woman you would want me to be. I'll protect the Iwai name. So please don't do anything rash no matter what happens to the Iwai group. Wait... This is it... I appreciate your coming here, but I don't have anything I can give you. We have something for you. This is from the Madam for you for the New Year. The Madam? And, this is a New Years card from Takeshi. He said he started a restaurant in Nagasaki. He said Emi is the best wife in the world. I see... That's great. Once the New Year's festivities are over without incident, we can finally say that the Iwai group is safe. To Manchuria? I'm disgusted with Kinbara. Kinbara? My ex-husband. I thought I would leave everything and live a simple life. I thought I would tell you everything as a way of apologizing to you. I told one of your leaders about you and Seijiro. To Kanji? I couldn't help, he was so upset at the time. But, moreover... It was Kinbara that killed Iwai. The Shinjikai paid him off. Kanji, I have to talk to you about the festivities tomorrow. I want you to handle the festivities with Amano now that we've settled everything with him. Sir, that is an Iwai group tradition and I just can't agree to this. You don't have to worry what others say. This is just within our group. What do you mean? I exchanged sake cups with Amano. Sir... Omori Island belongs to the Iwai Group. Kanji, do you even know the Madam's background? She had a relationship with Seijiro. We can't support such a group. The Sakurada Group will manage Omori Island from now on and Amano will be my assistant. I'll let you continue your group, so just do as I say. Sir... Do you understand? The fireworks? He wants us to give it to Amano tomorrow. The Sakurada Group is after our island. Kanji, Iwai was murdered by a man named Kinbara who was hired by Amano. Is that what happened? So the chairman ordered it. So Aikawa was right after all. I'm such a fool. Ma'am... please forgive me. I suspected the two of you... You knew about us, right? Please listen to what I have to say. What you heard is true. I couldn't forget about him no matter how hard I tried and even went to Naoetsu to die, but I couldn't. Seijiro came to get me, but I asked him to run away with me. But... he never gave in. Kanji... I was able to accept this life because I finally understood Seijiro's way of life. I don't care what people say about me. But, please believe Seijiro. Ma'am... Please let me take care of the fireworks tomorrow. Good evening... Where did you hide Suzume? What are you doing? Kinbara, I won't let you do what you please. Get out of Omori immediately! What? What do you want, Kanji? I brought the answer to you. Who cares about that. I can't have you not care. But I'm looking for a man named Kinbara before I do anything. I'm Kinbara... What's the matter? We're in trouble! Kanji... Kanji? Kanji! Kanji! Bro... Some guy named Kinbara killed the boss. Amano hired him. Bro... Please go home to Iwai for me. Madam told me what happened in Naoetsu. It must have been hard for you. Kanji... hang in there. Forgive me. Please stay with her. She needs you. Kanji! Please forgive me, too. I should have done what you told me to do no matter how much shame it brought to me. This wouldn't have happened if I had just listened. Please forgive me. Ma' am! What is this about? Madam Iwai, I'll take care of tomorrow's festivities. You should know why. We took care of Kanji. All he went there for was to settle the score for Iwai. Let's end it here if you want to say that he was wrong. Do whatever you please with me. Taking your life won't settle anything. I'm sure Seijiro was behind this. Where's Seijiro? I'm in charge of the Iwai Group. I'm right here. Seijiro... Amano, let me thank you on behalf of Iwai and Kanji. Have you gone mad? You're the one that's gone mad! Stop! Seijiro! Ma' am! Shizu, hold on. Shizu, let's get out of here. Get out of this life. THE END
