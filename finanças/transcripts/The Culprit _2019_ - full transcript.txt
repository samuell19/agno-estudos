LITTLEBIG PICTURES presents You can't go in there, sir. Sir! I'm family! Who are you? Hey, you can't be here. Get out! I said get out! - Hey, Park! - Where's Young-Hoon? - Get the hell out! - Young-Hoon... - Go! - Where the hell is he?! Young-Hoon! - Young-Hoon! - You can't be here! Secure the perimeter, you idiots! - Wait, wait... - Get out! Jesus... You can't be here, okay? Take him outside! Come on! It's okay, let him go... Young-Hoon... Go secure the perimeter. I'll keep an eye on him. Young-Hoon... Joon-Sung... SAE-BYEOK SONG SUN YOO HYUK-JIN JANG MIN SUK OH HAE GYUN JUNG Written and Directed by JUNGWOOK KOH 6 months later Joon-Sung's wife Who the hell are you? Help! Please! What the hell! Homicide Case 2018-503 Still not answering? No. This is bad... It's almost time. Nothing happened at my office yesterday, right? Let's just get inside. Actually... I'll go check on him. No, don't do that. Forcing him to testify won't do us any good. No, I better go see him. Please tell my husband not to worry. Young-Hoon You have reached the voicemail box of... Hey! Hey! Relax, it's not your blood. Who are you? Why are you doing this to me? How did you know Yoo-Jung? Who? I don't know who that is! I think there's been a misunderstanding... Listen, you bastard. Either you answer my questions, or you answer my questions after I beat you up, you got that? Why is this case number written in your notebook? Why is that any of your business? Wait! Stop! Wait! You are mistaken... I had nothing to do with it! It's the truth! Then why were you here a few days ago? I was here? Then this is... Why were you here?! I was just curious... Curious? You were curious about a case that was never reported in the media? I heard there was a murder near my home, so... It's been 6 months. And you just got curious? Right after the first hearing?! It's the truth. My wife told me about it a few days ago, that's why. It's the truth! I swear...! People like you never talk. Always playing dumb. Detective Cho Hello? 1 month ago Yes. I see. Got it. We couldn't just throw these out, so... Yoo-Jung Lim Victim's Belonging And I need you to sign this release form. You still haven't been home? You should stop staying at a motel and go home. The trial is over, you know. What's that? It's the case file. What? Sons of bitches! You can't take that! Let go! Hey, let him go. Just let him go. Mr. Young-Hoon Lee! Your landlord keeps calling us. She wants you to vacate the house. She's too scared to call you. It's time for you to go home. How can you let him take that? The case is closed. The prosecution has the real file. That was just a leftover. Young-Hoon! Young-Hoon! How did you find me? I saw you passing by... Young-Hoon. Can we talk...? I'm sorry... Please! I'm begging you. It won't take long, I promise. Have a seat. I came by your house a couple times... I guess you haven't... What's this about? Have you heard about Joon-Sung's appeal? Yes. I was wondering if... you could testify at the appeal. Please go home. I'm really sorry for asking you this, but please help us. The lawyer says we need new evidence or witness. What do you want from me? What you told the police before. That Joon-Sung would never do such a thing. You failed to mention that in your testimony... You're not having a second thought, are you? No, Young-Hoon. You can't do that. You know my husband is not the killer. What do I know? I know nothing. How can you say that? You're his best friend. You only think about your husband. Do you ever think about my wife, Yoo-Jung? She is the reason we have to find the real killer! The killer is still out there because the cops got the wrong person! How can you be so sure? How do you know he didn't do it? Maybe you just wanna believe him. I know! I know my husband would never do such a thing. I just do! You know exactly what I'm talking about! You know him better than I do! No, I don't. Yes, you do. Isn't that why you're in so much pain? You know it in your heart but you can't prove it, that's why! Don't be absurd. Then what about Yoo-Jung? Do you also believe what the cops say about her? That she had an affair with my husband? That she slept with your best friend?! A single strand of hair. The police got the entire case wrong because of it. They haven't done anything else. If you don't help us, we may lose both your wife and my husband. Please stop it. Young-Hoon... I said stop it! Please leave me alone. Go away. Go. Young-Hoon... Please help us. You're the only one we have. - Go! - Young-Hoon! Please! Please help us! - Go! - Young-Hoon! Young-Hoon! You slut. I killed her. What do you think you're doing?! You think we don't know what your husband did? Calm down! Who knows what she'll do to us, too? Like I give a damn! This crazy bitch should know her place! For God's sake... Will you calm down a little? - Bye, Eun-Jin. - Mommy! Hey, kid! Don't come to the kindergarten anymore! Are you alright? You got that? What the hell are you doing?! Don't you raise your voice at me! - Stop it! Stop! - You stupid little... You want some? I'll kill you! Let go of me! Mommy! You crazy bitch! It's okay, honey. This is why I don't deal with those middle class people. How uncivilized. Come here! Who the hell are you?! Sorry, I thought no one was here. Don't you people have anything better to do? I'm sorry, I'm sorry... Freaking bastards... The hair. How did you do it? What hair? What are you talking about? You don't know? No, I really don't. Why are you doing this to me? You think I killed your wife or something? The cops already caught the killer! Why are you doing this to me over a closed case?! If you don't believe me, take me to the cops so they can investigate me. But you want something else from me, don't you? What? Why else would you do this? Why go through all this trouble yourself, when you can just tell the cops about me? What do you want from me? Do you want me to lie and say I killed your wife? You bastard! Do you think this is a joke?! Then why are you doing this? Why are you trying to frame me?! Help! Young-Hoon! 2 weeks after the incident Young-Hoon! Young-Hoon! Young-Hoon! Let go of me! - Are you nuts? - You have a right to... What's going on here?! Let go! Joon-Sung! Joon-Sung! Why are you taking him? It wasn't my husband! We'll tell you everything at the station, okay? Joon-Sung! Joon-Sung! Joon-Sung! Joon-Sung! It's a 99% match. We've visited them so many times. Obviously, you'll find his hair. He came over just a few days before the incident as well. Yes, we're aware of that. The problem is where the hair was found. The victim bled near the mouth, and the hair we found was stuck in that blood. It means, the hair fell on her lips after she started bleeding. And that puts Mr. Joon-Sung Kim at the crime scene when she died. That can't be. That doesn't make any sense! The estimated time of death is around 9 PM. Mr. Kim claims he was home at the time, but he doesn't have anyone to prove that. You told us even you were at your sister's house that day. What about the security cams? You said you'd look into them. Well... There wasn't much we could use. And we couldn't recognize anything because of the heavy rain. You got this all wrong. If you reinvestigate... Mr. Kim was the last person the victim called before she died. We even got the texts between them off his phone. My husband didn't do this! Stop. You two can't be together right now. Ms. Da-Yeon Jeong, you're a suspect in this investigation! What? I have to speak to you alone. - Hey, Lee. - Yes, sir? - Show him to the room. - Young-Hoon... This way, please. Young-Hoon... We're searching your house, so you can't go there for a few days. What'll happen to my husband? We'll hold him until the investigation is over. In the meanwhile, you can still visit him. Tell her about the procedure. This way, ma'am. Detective, please help my husband. He's not someone who could have done this. They all tend to say that. What? What does that mean? What do you mean! Leave us alone. I didn't want to tell you this... But this case... It's a love affair. What? Didn't Mr. Kim borrow money from the victim to start his café? It was quite much. They go way back. They were college friends... We met all of his college friends. They said he used to like her. Who said that? My husband fixed her up with Young-Hoon. Didn't Mr. Kim suggest them to move to your neighborhood? Wasn't he the one to always suggest the four of you hanging out together? Haven't you ever thought it was all because of her? No. They didn't move because of my husband. Young-Hoon only had his grandma as family. So when she passed away last year... What I've heard is quite the opposite. Your parents passed away and you grew up with your sister. So Mr. Kim asked the victim to move, saying you were getting lonely. No way! You and Mr. Kim had a fight on the day the victim died, right? Wasn't it because of her? We never found the victim's phone. Nothing else was missing, but just her phone. That means the killer wanted to hide something. And according to Mr. Young-Hoon Lee, the victim's face was covered with a towel when she was found. That's quite common when the killer knows the victim. But that doesn't mean my husband is the killer! Take a look. These are the texts between Mr. Kim and the victim. - I'll tell her myself, so keep it a secret. - For how long? - If you don't, I'll tell her! - I'll take care of it... To be honest, we are confident it's just a matter of time before we find the murder weapon in your house. What?! Will you calm down and listen?! Why did you go there?! I told you. After we fought, I just wanted some advice. How could you... No, it's nothing like that! It's not what you think! I told you that's not what happened! How is it nothing like that? How could you go there... right after we had a fight? Don't you dare call her! Are you nuts? Why can't I call her? Got something to hide? You think I don't know what you're doing? What am I doing? You met your sister yesterday, didn't you? Didn't I tell you not to see her? I told you it's over if you ever see her again! Why can't I see my own sister? Because So-Yeon is freaking crazy. She got cheated on, so she's putting these crazy thoughts into you as well! Why is this my sister's fault? Is it normal for a married woman to ask out a married man for drinks? How many times has Yoo-Jung asked you out? How is that Yoo-Jung asking me out?! She's asking both of us out for drinks when Young-Hoon is too busy! How is that for both of us? She calls you because she knows I can't leave our daughter alone! Forget it, that's enough. What's enough? I know you sneak out from the café to go see her! Have you lost your mind like your crazy sister? So it's my fault again? She's the crazy one, not me! You and your sister are crazy! You two are freaking insane! I understand you two grew up without your parents. But if you can't trust anyone else, just go live with your sister, okay? What? It's a mental disease, you know. So stop bothering me! I'm sick of this! Why do you bring my family into this? Is it my fault I grew up without my parents? That bitch is the one ruining our family! How come this is my parents' fault? Mommy, mommy! It's okay, it's okay. Why are you telling me this now? Who knew I'd end up here? How could I know I'd be arrested? You have to trust me, Yeon. You're the only one who can help me. All this wouldn't have happened if you just listened to me! I don't know, I just... This can't be real! Joon-Sung. Who else knows about this? No one. You're the first. I just thought you should know. What about Young-Hoon? He doesn't know. But the thing is... There was this guy who saw me at Yoo-Jung's house. What? Who was that? I've never seen him before. Yoo-Jung didn't know him, either. Let's tell this to the police then. This guy could have killed her right after you left the house. What if he didn't? Then this only proves I was at the crime scene! The lawyer said the cops will be looking for my motive. So you just tell the cops Yoo-Jung and I never had an affair. Don't tell anyone about this, okay? What about Young-Hoon? What would he think if he finds out I met her that night? What if he talks to the cops? Then I'm just screwed! Don't ever mention this to anyone, okay? Not Young-Hoon, not even my lawyer. Got it? Young-Hoon! Young-Hoon, it's me! Please open the door! Young-Hoon! Please come with me, there's no time for this. I said I'll be there. What's going on? Please don't do this... I'll be right there, so you go ahead, okay? Young-Hoon, you promised me. You said you'll testify. Did you... Did you tell anyone... ...about you coming here? Is someone in there? Did you tell anyone? Did you tell someone or not?! I didn't tell anyone! What about him? What did he tell you? Nothing. He claims he doesn't know. What else? Did he say anything? No. What do you think you're doing? Let him go! Stop! What if he's not the killer? You'll be in trouble for this! I don't care. Young-Hoon! There's no time for this. Don't you see how important it is that you testify today? The police can only investigate this man when Joon-Sung is free. What if Joon-Sung isn't released? What then? Why would this man confess to you? Even if he did, getting a confession like this wouldn't help us in any way. So what? We just let him go? There's no other way to find out if he's the real killer or not. We can tell the police! What should we tell them? “I think he's the real killer, not my friend.” Do you think they'll believe us? Still, this is not the way. Will you let this man go and get to the court with me? Just give me some time, okay? I'll just find out a few things, then I'll get to the court. Proving Joon-Sung's innocence is first! To me, this is first. Getting Joon-Sung out of jail is all you that matters to you. Not to me. Why do you think I recreated the crime scene? Why do you think I went through all this? Who cancels on the moving day? That was so long ago. We wiped out the footage. I'll kill you! Don't freak out. I made that. What? I recreated the crime scene. Come over here. Don't touch anything. Why did you do all this? You once told me. I know it in my heart, but I can't prove it. That's why I'm in so much pain. You're right. Maybe they did have an affair. Maybe they didn't. It's been driving me crazy. Every day and night. I thought about moving, but it didn't seem like the way. So I decided to figure out what exactly happened. That way, I'll get to live my life, either hating or forgiving them. But the cops closed the case. And nothing was left anymore. So I made this place look exactly like the crime scene to find some answers here. Answers to what happened that night. Did you? No. Then are you saying it's Joon-Sung? No, I don't think it's him. I made this from the police photos. Yoo-Jung must have covered her undies because someone came by. If it was Joon-Sung, she would have moved it. There was this time Joon-Sung came over. Yoo-Jung came home late and got really mad at me. She yelled at me for leaving her undies out. That means it wasn't Joon-Sung who came by that night. Someone just dropped by shortly, or she didn't mind showing them. Have a look. It's the towel the killer covered Yoo-Jung's face with. I didn't think much of it, but when I looked closely... This is the gift we handed out at our first birthday party... I remember Joon-Sung spent days looking for that rainbow design. He must have recognized the towel, and he wouldn't have used it to cover Yoo-Jung's face. It's not enough to tell who the real killer is, but at least it's not Joon-Sung. Thank you so much. I'll talk to the police. I already did, but it's no good. What did they say? It's not enough to be evidence. Those bastards still believe they had an affair, and they just won't listen. I'll testify. Really? Yes. So please help me. Help me find that son of a bitch who killed Yoo-Jung. I don't think I can do it by myself. No matter how hard I try, I can't find anything. So they just keep coming back to me. Maybe Yoo-Jung did have an affair. Maybe Joon-Sung did kill her. So please help me. If you're thinking that, why me? You trust them more than I do. My priority is not about proving Joon-Sung's innocence. It's about finding out who killed Yoo-Jung. And more importantly, why she had to die. Do you understand? But you found him. You said it might not be him. If he's not the real killer, then maybe Joon-Sung is. What? You still think Joon-Sung could have done this? You know that's not true! Then who and why! The cops say it's Joon-Sung. You say it's not. Someone has to be the killer! How can you do this to us? You said Joon-Sung isn't the killer. But now you just change your mind? Even if he's proven innocent, you're not gonna believe it. You never believed it in the first place! Shoot! Do whatever you want! Whether you kill him or not, do whatever you want! I'm sorry, there's nothing I can do. What? It's him. Please untie me. I can explain everything. Hurry! He's the real killer! What? I remembered something while you two were talking. I saw him the last time I came here! Hello? Yes, Young-Hoon. I just got in. Okay, I'll be there soon. Got it. It's Yoo-Jung's. How come you have... I never meant to hide it, but it has so many private pictures of us... so it kind of felt weird showing them to the cops... The phone was locked when I found it. Probably the killer entered the wrong password. Maybe the killer wanted something from her phone... Did you find anything? There is a text Yoo-Jung tried to send to Joon-Sung. Here. Just came by. “Y”... Someone came by the house? Yes, I think so. Just came by. “Y”... “Y”? Probably just a typo. I hope you won't tell the police about the phone. I don't wanna cause any trouble, you know. I didn't touch anything. It's exactly how you left it during your house search. As you made me promise. Thank you, So-Yeon. I'll clean this room later, so please leave everything as it is. There are some important documents here. And please take care of her for a few days. No problem, she's my niece. But what's going on? We're reopening the case. Eun-Jin, come here. Why is the police reopening the case? It's not the police. Then who? Wait. You're not doing this with the victim's husband, are you? Are you nuts? How can you trust him? What if he does something to you? He's not like that. How do you know that? What if you find the proof that Joon-Sung killed her? What else would he be looking for? What should I do then? He's the only one who believes Joon-Sung is innocent! I have to do something! I can't have my daughter grow up without a father! Someone came by the house, so she covered up the laundry. Then she opened the door. I think this is where it happened. There were signs of a struggle. But I just can't get my head around it. What do you mean? Come over here. Think of me as the killer. Then I go... Exactly! She could have picked up anything, but she did not fight back. Maybe she was too scared. Maybe. Can you lie down over here? I think the killer pushed her down here. There are signs of her struggling. Like this. Like this. Exactly! You ran towards the exit, but Yoo-Jung ran straight to the room! Not even fighting back! I'm sorry... Scared of what? Young-Hoon? What about him? Did he do something to you?! No, it's not like that... Joon-Sung... What if it's Young-Hoon? What? Why would anyone kill Yoo-Jung? And since Young-Hoon found her body first... What if it's not him? What will you do then? What if you doubt him and he refuses to testify? Yeon. I know this is hard, I really do. But please just don't... Don't do anything stupid until Young-Hoon testifies, okay? You know you're my only hope. I need you to be strong for just a little longer. Do you understand? Please untie me. How can I trust you? Why do you think he's doing this? He killed his wife and I'm the only witness. That's why he is doing this to me! Were you really here that night? Why were you here? I got into the wrong building. I'll explain everything later. Please... Why would I lie? When he's done with me, it's probably gonna be your turn. If you untie me, I'll tell the police everything. You'll do that? Yes, so please... This is our only chance. What the hell are you doing?! Are you freaking nuts?! Open the door! Call the police, hurry! Open the door! Open it now! Hello? Please hurry! Someone's trying to kill us! This is Sin-hung street... Are you freaking nuts? Hang up the phone! The house of the recent murder! Young-Hoon! No! You bastard! What did you say to her? What did you say?! I said I was here the night your wife got killed. What? I knew it was you... I was right, he's the killer! Why did you call the police?! I told her I saw you. What? You saw me? That's a lie! He's telling a lie, Young-Hoon. Don't believe anything he says! Yes, it's a lie. The one I saw that night was your friend. You bastard! You better not fool around, okay? Is that true? I saw it with my own eyes. Her husband and your wife were together. You can't believe him. He's trying to fool us! And you? You believed him enough to think I killed my own wife. I'm so sorry, I just... I trusted Joon-Sung... Everyone said he is the killer! Who else trusted him like I did?! And you! Why did you lie to her? Would you have believed me if I told you about your friend? Especially when you think I'm the real killer? Do you think she called the police because she believed me? She made the call when I said I'll tell the cops it was you. No, that's not true! That's not true at all! You can't let him fool us. He's just trying to tear us apart! Then why were you here before? Why did you come here with a knife in your hand? See? He can't say anything. He's making everything up! Are you out of your freaking mind?! You're gonna testify for that filthy animal?! 1 day before the final hearing The one who killed my daughter?! Aren't you sorry for Yoo-Jung? Stop it! That's enough! You! Don't you dare testify tomorrow! You got that?! Please stop... You freaking lunatics! Let's go home! Please stop. We did everything we could, so please... No. I haven't found anything yet. Stop it! Tomorrow's the final hearing! What's the point of all this?! You want me to stop? I haven't found anything, and you want me to stop?! Good thing you're here. About the security cams... Yes. My son copied the files to a flash drive, but the cops didn't take it. They must have thought it wasn't anything important... Hold on. Where is it? Oh, here it is. I hope it helps. They don't show my house, but the end here leads to it. So at least we can see the ones who passed by the store. What is it? This guy... You know him? He came here a few days ago. 84-2421 Why were you here with a knife? I wanted to kill him. What? Not your wife. I wanted to kill that bastard. What the hell are you talking about?! I wasn't after your wife! I was after her husband! Joon-Sung? Why? She knows why better than I do. No, I don't. I don't know what he's talking about. What do you mean she knows better than you?! I'll tell you when the cops get here. How do I know you'll believe me? She is gonna keep saying she doesn't know anything. You put me in this mess! There is no way you'll believe me! Even if I tell you the truth, what's the point if you just kill me?! No, don't! He's trying to fool you like he fooled me! No, stop! Young-Hoon! Young-Hoon... Now talk. What do you mean you wanted to kill Joon-Sung? Her husband and my wife... were having an affair. Then what were those texts? Yoo-Jung found out. About what?! Damn! What is it?! I, uh... Mina's mom from the kindergarten... I just met her once... Our daughter's kindergarten? I swear it was just a one-time thing. We just watched a movie, that's all. So all those calls at night. It was with Mina's mom? Not with Yoo-Jung? I swear to God! I swear nothing happened! It's a lie! Don't listen to him! So what does that have to do with you coming here? My wife went out for a drive. I thought she was going out to see him. But I didn't know where she was going. So I went to his place. I thought I'd catch him if I hurried. He came out just when I got there. I thought he was meeting my wife. Then I saw him going into a house. Thinking they rented their own place to have an affair? I just lost it. So I ran into a store. But then... It wasn't my wife. Who are you? What is it? Who the hell are you? Then why did you come back here after the murder? I thought the whole affair was just a misunderstanding. But a few days ago, my wife came home with a black eye. She wouldn't eat and she looked nervous all the time. So I asked her, and she told me everything. The man she had an affair with killed another woman. And she has been afraid it could've been her. Then his wife came along, threatening to kill her. So I looked into the case. - Your wife's case. - Can I get a case number? And I found out that the day I went to your house, February 13 ...was the day your wife got murdered. February 13? I came back here to check if this was the place. No, Young-Hoon. He's making things up! Don't listen to him! How can I believe you? - That's your problem. - What? Think about it. Why did she come here? Are you naive or stupid? You... Do you know what she said as soon as she saw me? She asked you if told you anything. Still don't get it? What did he tell you? She knew everything from the start. And she was worried I might tell you about her husband. Do you get it now? You've been used by her and your friend all along. No, Young-Hoon! It's not like that! Is that why you came here, instead of the court? No, why would I do that? It doesn't matter whether it's you or me. All she cares about is getting her husband out of jail. Stop it, you bastard! When I told her it was you, she saw the chance. She calls the police right away, thinking she can frame you. No, it's not true! You have to tell me! We can't just give away information like that. Then start investigating! We can't investigate someone who is not a suspect! Enough of this nonsense! He bought a knife from the store! You didn't find the murder weapon! Then you should investigate! Okay, fine! We'll take care of it. You should head back home. - Hey, Park! Escort him out! - Yes, sir. This way, sir! Investigate him now! Yes, that's right. There is nothing we can do about him. Maybe if we found him earlier, but tomorrow's the hearing, so... We have nothing on him, and it's not like he confessed. What happens if Joon-Sung is found guilty at the appeal? If we can prove this man is the killer at the Supreme Court appeal, can my husband be free? Well... They only deal with the papers at the Supreme Court. They only review the verdict and decide whether the trial was fair... so there won't be any investigation. If he's found guilty at the appeal... the Supreme Court may dismiss any further appeals. What do we do then? That's why tomorrow's appeal is important. We have to do our best, and I'll request for more investigation before the verdict. So we just sit still? When he can be the real killer? The prosecution firmly believes Mr. Joon-Sung Kim is the killer, so we can't do anything until he is proven innocent. Got a smoke? And a lighter? Why are you so obsessed over this? The court found him guilty. Why can't you just accept that? Because you're all wrong. What if you're wrong? No. You're wrong, I'm certain of it. You're certain of it. Do you know who says that the most? The victims of fraud cases. We put out a warrant for the fraud, and we go talk to the victims. Then they all say the same. “You're wrong. I'm certain of it.” Do you know why they say that? Because they believe the fraud? No. It's because they don't wanna admit that they could be wrong. If what we told them is true, then they're gonna have to admit how stupid they've been for seeing and hearing only what they liked. You should think about it. Whether you actually believe your friend is innocent, or you just wanna prove that you've been right. Mr. Young-Hoon Lee. Here. The registered address of the vehicle 84-2421. You think this is the rock bottom? You got nothing to lose, and it can't get any worse? You may be wrong about that. I hope you won't regret this. 1508 Humanville Apartment, #702 The prosecution firmly believes Mr. Joon-Sung Kim is the killer, so we can't do anything until he is proven innocent. They won't look for another suspect when they think the killer is caught. Let's say we release Mr. Joon-Sung Kim. Do you know what happens if we find out he's the killer? We can't arrest him again. If we lose the appeal, the Supreme Court might dismiss any further appeals. Then there is no reason at all for the prosecution to go after this man. Even if Mr. Joon-Sung Kim confesses to the whole world that he's the killer, there's nothing we can do about it. It's called double jeopardy. Now I see what you want. Once Joon-Sung is released, he can never be arrested for the same charge, so you've been trying to hide the truth until I testify. That's why you came here. No, that's not true. You got this all wrong. You know Joon-Sung didn't do this. Look at all the evidence you found! Screw those junks. I don't need them anymore. It's the police! Help! Help! No! If you open that door right now, they'll be coming for you! If he tells them about the kidnap and the torture, you're gonna be arrested! No, I won't tell them anything! And I'll tell the cops what I saw! That I saw your friend here! No, he's lying! You have to trust me. You think she's on your side? I can get you the real killer, and punish that bastard who had an affair with my wife! Young-Hoon! Please! You don't have to testify. Just don't say anything to the police. Please just wait until today's appeal is over. I'm begging you! It's all over now. Young-Hoon! No! Young-Hoon! What if you're wrong? Then they're gonna have to admit how stupid they've been for seeing and hearing only what they liked. Yoo-Jung must have covered her undies because someone came by. Yoo-Jung ran straight to the room! Not even fighting back! Then are you saying it's Joon-Sung? No, I don't think it's him. It wasn't Joon-Sung who came by that night. So-Yeon - “Y”? - Probably just a typo. So-Yeon Are you naive or stupid? Her husband and my wife were having an affair. I wanted to kill him. She knows why better than I do. I just do! She knew everything from the start. Why are you doing this? Ms. Da-Yeon, you're a suspect! What? Who is it? Hey, Yeon. What brings you down here? Come in. Is it raining a lot? Joon-Sung was here, wasn't he? No, was he supposed to? Joon-Sung: I'll take care of it. Just came by. “Y”... Give it to me! Yeon, it's not what you think! How could you do this to me? You of all people! Yeon, please! How could you?! How could you... Please calm down! Young-Hoon Locked You... You killed Yoo-Jung? It wasn't Joon-Sung. It was you... This is all your fault. All this wouldn't have happened if you didn't move here. Everything would've worked out if you didn't do all these! It's all your fault. It's your freaking fault! Put the hammer down. Put it down. I know you're in there! Open the door! If you open that door, I'll tell them you did all these. That you killed this bastard, and tried to kill me, too! You just have to stay quiet. Just tell the police he's the real killer. And my husband... Help me save my husband... Please, Young-Hoon. I'm begging you... Don't let my daughter grow up without a father! Please! Come on! Break it down! What's it gonna be? What's it gonna be! It turned out Mr. Young-Hoon Lee killed his own wife. He thought she was having an affair with you, so he killed her and placed your hair on the crime scene to make you take the fall. And my wife's case? Right. When Mr. Lee realized there was a witness, he kidnapped and tortured him. But your wife found out about it. So he once again... At least that's what the prosecution believes... What did Young-Hoon say? He's not talking at all. Even his lawyer gave up. Isn't it obvious? It's because he did it. Eun-Jin! Eun-Jin! Daddy! How have you been? She can stay with me for a little longer. No, I should take care of her. This is all of Da-Yeon's stuff. Things have been so crazy, I didn't even see what's inside. Come back if I left something out. Sure. Eun-Jin. Bye, sweetie, Come visit any time. - We'll be off then. - Okay. Daddy! Daddy! Yes, Eun-Jin? Can you pick this up? No more snacks, okay? Look at your face. Clean yourself up. You think this is the rock bottom? You got nothing to lose, and it can't get any worse? You may be wrong about that. I hope you won't regret this. I won't. We only regret when we don't know the truth. THE CULPRIT
