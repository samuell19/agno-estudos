NED: Oh, man! BOOMER: I'm freezin'! WILLIE: (STUTTERING) Say, Rog, you really think this is such a good day to go fishing? Maybe you guys would rather go home and cut valentines out of construction paper and doilies! Well, yeah! Sounds enjoyable, Rog. I'll make hot chocolate! Let's go over this one more time. We're not here for fish, you goons! We're here to bag a couple of losers! Oh, can it. Here they come! 145 hours, 38 minutes. You're not counting down to the Valentine's dance again, are you? No! Yes. Hey! Are you doofuses still hunting for that lake monster? Yes! Except for the part about being doofuses. When Doug and I get our monster picture, Roger, you'll see. Hey, I know where you can find a whole bunch of monster pictures. Huh? Huh? Your family album! Good one! Family album! I don't get it. Go ahead and laugh, Roger. We're gonna find that monster. (LAUGHING) Sooner than you think! (ALL LAUGHING) Hey, what are we all nudging each other for? You're pushing my buttons, Bledsoe. Let's get going. Move it, move it! I wonder if I need some new shoes. Yeah! Something fast in case we get chased by that monster. No. For the dance. Oh. Oops! What the... We better leave the bikes here. I guess I could wear these ones. I don't wanna look too, "Hey, I'm wearing new shoes!" At least not... Shh. (SKEETER GASPS) (GIGGLES ECHOING) You hear that? Yeah. I'll go this way, you go that way. ROGER: Pull that out. Gee, Roger, don't you think this is kind of mean? How many times do I gotta explain that it's unhealthy for me to bottle up my natural childlike spontaneity? You want me to get an ulcer? NED: A dude's gotta keep his chi flowin', man. ROGER: Exactly. You wanna stay healthy, you gotta keep in balance with nature. Now, let's go scare the hoo-ha outta Blue Boy. Hold it, monster. (EXCLAIMS) You're not going anywhere. Yeah? Who's gonna stop us, Funnie? Uh, um... (ROGER LAUGHING) Man! Hmm. Never been here before. What a mess! Ugh! Whoa! Camera. Oh, man! Where is it? It's here somewhere. (GROWLS) Huh? (SCREAMS) Oh! My eyes! (BOYS CLAMORING) Very funny, you guys. Hardy-har! Very believable, too. Did you rent it or did you make it yourself? Well, you had your fun. Now you can go home. (ALL GASPING) Roger? Uh, Roger? There's something bad behind me, isn't there? (STAMMERING) (BOYS SCREAMING) (CREATURE GROWLING) (SCREAMING) (BARKS) Roll it, Porkchop. That's me! Porkchop! Porkchop! (SCREAMING) (GROWLS) DOUG: Dear journal, it's me, Doug Funnie. I've lived at 21 Jumbo Street for the last year and a half, and I've seen a lot of weird things. But what happened last week was probably the weirdest. I guess it all started right before Valentine's Day. That means at school, people have just one thing on their minds. A Valentine's dance! Let's go shopping. Uh... Isn't it romantic? A Valentine's dance. How delightful. A Valentine's... A Valentine's... ...dance? The monster! I finally found it! DOUG: Well, almost everybody was talking about the Valentine's Day dance. It was all I was thinking about. Can anyone tell me how ancient Egypt ultimately became a Roman province? DOUG: Well, and one other thing, too. MR. MAYONNAISE: Miss Mayonnaise? It was Mark Antony's eternal love for Cleopatra that incited the great Battle of Actium. DOUG: There's only been one Valentine for me. One person who I've shared my happiest moments with, and a couple not so happy ones. We've gone through the same hardships, like my sister Judy. Leonardo, Mona, you're supposed to be sixteenth-century lovers. Now, kiss her like you mean it! DOUG: For all those reasons, I knew I had to find a way to make this dance really perfect. BEEBE: This dance is gonna really stink! Huh? How can it stink? The student council's supposed to pick two people to coordinate the dance, but nobody signed up. People are so selfish! Sure, everybody wants to go to the dance. But do they want to lift a finger to help? No. Why don't you help, Beebe? You expect me to put my mouth on balloons, touch streamers? Ugh! No way. We have less than a week left. Whoever we get is gonna have to work day and night to get ready. Day and night? Right. Pay close attention, Miss Mayonnaise. We amass the streamers over here, flank with the punch bowl, maneuver the record player into position, and we hit 'em right in the middle with a big heart-shaped mirror ball. Bang! Oh, Doug, you're so dance plannery. Indeed. Still, it's not quite there. We need something. A theme! How 'bout something simple like "true love"? (GULPS) True love? True love! You know, when two people love each other. Truly. Oh! That true love. I know two people perfect for the job, Beebe. Do you really think I'd be good at organizing a dance? I've never done anything like that. I think you'd be great at whatever you wanted to do, Patti. If you worked on this dance, it would be the best dance ever! Really? Not much competition. Looks like I'm the only one crazy enough to... Okay, people, work, work, work. I'm outta here. Why don't you watch where... Oh! Hey, looking for me? Not exactly... Oh, I think I know! Heart Day just around the corner. Want to talk in "priveto"? Guy, I'm here to sign up to work on the dance. What? That dinky, lower-grade dance? I got a dozen better ideas. Instead of hanging out with a bunch of babies, you can trade candies with me! Scoot the boot with the upper-grade crowd. What do you say? Guy? Can't you see I'm talking to someone? Time to grab your opportunities before they grab someone else. Get me? Ticktock, ticktock. (MIMICS BUZZER) Contestant, your answer please! Thanks anyway, Guy, but I'm going to the dance. I may even be working on it. Whatever sands your wood. Don't say I didn't offer. I'm outta here. Last chance to change your mind. Good-bye, Guy. That... Guy! There! Hey, Patti! Can you help me get this stuff to the car? Sure, Daddy. See you, Doug. DOUG: This was going to be the perfect surprise. I knew Patti and I were just the team to make the coolest dance ever. I don't know about you, but I'm still scared, man. This is terrible. I thought that lake thing was gonna kill me! It must've thought we were trying to attack Valentine. Yeah! It was protecting him. Valentine's got a monster on his side. A monster? On his side? Oh! Valentine, is that a nose or a ski slope? (LAUGHING) (WHISTLES) Rog, you okay? I think his brain vapor locked. Stand back. (COUGHING) What the... His idea. Why, you! I ought to... Oh, ah... Uh, Rog. Shh! I think I'm getting an idea! How can you tell? What does it feel like? Maybe it's gas. Just wait. It's gonna be the biggest thing to ever hit this town! ALL: Again? I can't believe your camera went off when it hit the ground. Yeah! Maybe I got a picture of the monster! Oh, Doug! I wanna thank you. You saved the dance! Where are ya, honeybunch? Whoa! Take these to the car, Daddy. Yes, dear. Oh, Skeeter, I was just doing a little shopping in case someone wants to take me to the dance. (STAMMERING) Meet you at the photo shop, man. Ugh, boys! Is that the boy you like, honeybunch? If you think I'm discussing that with you, Daddy, you're nuts! I already told Patti she's on the committee. She's very excited. Great! Look, Beebe, I'll help Skeet get his pictures, then head to school. What for? Well, to get started. I plan to work day and night to have this dance ready. Doug, you don't have to worry about a thing. Patti and Guy have it under control. Patti and Guy? Yeah! Guy's the other one on the dance committee. Isn't it great? But Guy said he didn't... He isn't even in our grade. I know! Isn't it great to have an upperclassman even think about helping? But how... How... How did we convince him? It was easy. We were sitting in the office after lunch. This dance is gonna be so the opposite of cool! Come on, Beebe. Let's see if somebody signed up during lunch. Hey! What happened to the list? GUY: Looking for this, ladies? Guy! Are you writing a story for the school paper? Writing? Well, here's a real headline! Guy Graham, upperclassman, heads up dinky dance! Bang! ALL: Wow! Now, let's get down to business, shall we? Help me down. I was on that list! Well, Doug, you understand. Guy has real accomplishments! And he's friends with my daddy. But I know your dad! Not like he does. Fine young man. See ya, Doug. Home, Jenkins. Perfect. That's just perfect. Don't worry, man. Guy may have more accomplishments now, but you're gonna blow him out of the water! How do you mean? When we show everybody that monster. Oh. Yeah. Perfect. Hey! Who's the cute baby? Ooh, it's me. Boy, that film must've been in the camera a long time. Skeet, are you really sure you saw something at the lake? What do you mean, man? You've been looking for this monster for months. Right? And last night you really wanted to see it. Maybe you only saw a shadow or swamp gas or something. (GASPING) You do have a pretty active imagination. What's this? Is this from your Halloween party? The monster! (GASPS) I told you there was a monster! I told everybody! Behold! (LAUGHING) Hoo-hoo! Yeah! Oh, oh. Let me see it again. Skeeter, we're gonna be famous! This is the biggest thing ever! Whoo-hoo! NARRATOR: When the biggest thing ever happens... "The biggest thing ever." NARRATOR: Doug imagines himself a superhero. Daring enough to wear his underwear over his pants. Quailman. "A big dance extravaganza." Well, that does sound big. I wonder if it's a trap. "P.S. Not a trap." Well, Quaildog, as I always say, "If it's in print, it must be true." (GROANS) NARRATOR: And so that night, Quailman rendezvouses with a certain young woman. Oh, Quailman, how nice of you to invite me to this big dance extravaganza. Well, dancing with Quaildog, while enjoyable, is not my idea of a perfect evening. Is everyone ready to dance? Who are you? Why are you clogging? I mean... (IN QUAILMAN VOICE) Who are you? I am the Lord of the Polka! Care to dance? Must dance. Curious. Sorry, pal. Full up. Fortunately, patience is the first quality of the quail. (LOUD RUMBLING) (GASPING) What the... (GROWLING) Looks like an uninvited guest is trying to crash the party, Quaildog. No time to lose. Fly away! NARRATOR: When danger calls, there's one superhero who's always there to pick up the phone. Part quail, part man, all hero. Quailman, and his super pal, Quaildog. (GROWLING) NARRATOR: How can the beast be stopped? Surely, Quailman must come to fisticuffs with this fiend from the fathoms. No, Mr. Narrator. Violence is only for those who have run out of good ideas! We simply have to speak reasonably to this fearsome fellow. Excuse me, large lizard-like creature. It's important for you to see... (GASPS) (MUFFLED SHOUTING) I don't like to make snap judgments, but it seems this outsized outlaw just ate me. NARRATOR: Quailman eaten like so many potato chips. (ALL SCREAMING) NARRATOR: Who will stop the amphibious archfiend now? Thinking quickly, Quaildog turns the disco lights into the eyes of the monster, momentarily disorienting the reptilian rowdy. Next, his canine sixth sense, combined with an extensive knowledge of pop culture, tells him the moment is right. He reroutes the signal to intercept the latest episode of a corny teen sitcom playing at that moment. Dylan, how can I love you when I'm really in love with your other personality, Rufus? NARRATOR: Quaildog's queasy quarry is no match for this mindless mushfest. The already reeling reptile can't stomach it. Quailman! Ew! Pee-ew! I try to be broad-minded, but I can't sit idly by and be digested by some scaly scofflaw. NARRATOR: Having learned that the beastly beast is impervious to reason, Quailman has no choice but to unleash the full force of the Quaileye, rendering his amphibious adversary helpless and stupefied. Oh, Quailman, you've saved us! Well, that's over. Wanna dance? Forget it! Defeating a monster is much cooler than decorating for a dance. No matter how bad he smells! Defeating a monster is much cooler than overseeing a dance. No matter how bad we smell. What? Skeet, we can't blow this now. We've gotta find that monster! ELMO: What are we doing here? Roger has gathered the greatest minds of Bluffington in one room. Yes. My brother and I have followed your work in the field of... A.V. (COUGHING) Nerd! Weirdo! Buffoon. (PREPARING TO SNEEZE) You may wonder why I gathered you here. (SNEEZING) Nincompoop! Bless you. As you may know, there is at this moment a monster which threatens our very way of life. (CLEARS THROAT) Lamebrain. There is only one... I'm sorry. I didn't catch that one. (COUGHING) Lamebrain. Thank you. As I was saying, there is only one thing that can save us from certain destruction. I present to you Robocrusher. (COUGHING) Doofus. Note the pincer claws and X-ray eyes. I've drawn myself down here for scale. Money is no object. Gentlemen, you have exactly 24 hours. (ALL COUGHING AND MUTTERING INSULTS) This is gonna make working on the school paper seem like working on the school paper. I don't know if we can actually catch him. After all, it's a monster. Let's just get our bikes before it gets dark. Where are they? They were right here. Bike tracks. Oh, yeah. Right next to the big webbed footprints! BOTH: Oh, man! SKEETER: You think the monster actually ate our bikes, man? Well, I don't think he's riding them around the bottom of the lake. Um, maybe we could use Dale's tricycle for bait. The monster will think it's a snack? I don't know, man. I mean, what if he doesn't stop at metal? What's to keep him from eating us? (PHONE RINGING) Can you get that? I think I got milk up my nose. Hello? PATTI: Oh, Doug. I'm glad you're there. I wanted to thank you. Thank me? I never would've thought of signing up to work with Guy if it weren't for you. Oh, great. Look, Pat... Did you hear the news? Guy got Mr. Bluff to give us money to have the dance at... Huh? Are you ready for this? Funky Town! Funky Town. That's, uh... Patti, can we meet and talk about this later? Something just came up. Sure, Doug. How 'bout Swirly's in an hour? Swirly's. An hour. Great. I was thinking. If that thing ate our bikes, he might like cafeteria food. He didn't eat them. Look! BOTH: Oh, man! I guess somebody must've brought them back. Yeah. Somebody with monster feet! Oh! But... I... I... He's... In the house! Come on. Looks like the coast is clear. Okay, let's go. Let's go. Okay, quiet. SKEETER: Oh! Oh! Oh! (LIGHTBULB SHATTERING) Oh, man! Nope! No monsters here. Shouldn't we go downstairs and check your room? (BOTH GULP) SKEETER: Hello! We're, um, coming downstairs! Here we come! SKEETER: Um, anybody here? Oh, you can open it if you want. Go ahead. (BOTH SCREAMING) Whew! (GASPS) Oh, man! I'll go get another flashlight. I'll get it. Where is it? Oh, that's okay. I know where it is. Yeah, but I'm the guest. The guest always gets the spare flashlight! That's etiquette, man. (WHISTLING NERVOUSLY) (LOW GROWLING) Hmm. (GRUNTS) Oh! Can't get down there. Can't quite... Hey, Doug, check under the bed, would ya? (PURRING) Yeah, now just look under the bed. Monster! (SCREAMING) (CONTINUES SCREAMING) (SIGHING) Oh, my head! Oh! (SCREAMS) Whoa! Oh! (SKEETER WHIMPERING) (MOANING SOFTLY) Huh? Skeeter? Well, he thinks my head fell off. He looks really upset. He's so nice. He's not scary at all. (BOTH SCREAM) (SNIFFING) He must've sniffed out where you live. Wow! He can read! Hey! This is a book! You don't eat books! That is a no. (WHIMPERS) That's nice. Be nice to the book. Wow. I think you scared him, man. I can't believe that. He tried to eat Herman Melville. Hey, he looked. Herman Melville? He thinks it's his name. You like that name? Herman Melville? Mmm! Okay, monster, from now on, your name is... BOTH: Herman Melville! (BOTH LAUGHING) Put it there, Herman. Huh? Oh! He likes you, man! Down, Herman, down! Herman! Whew! Finding Herman sure is a bigger deal than working on some dance. Yeah. Everybody thought I was crazy. Are they ever gonna be surprised! No! Herman, bad! No drinking out of the toilet! So, who do we tell first? Skeet, this is front-page headlines. We're gonna be famous. We have to go right to the top! (TOILET FLUSHING) (SQUEALING) I hope Mayor Tippi's home. Knock again. I just knocked. (LAUGHS) Well, hello, boys. You're just in time to see something absolutely fantastic! But, Mr. Dink, we've got a headline for you to put in the paper. Just a moment, Douglas. Wait'll you get a load of this! Virtual reality! (LAUGHING) Cool! It's like we're standing right in your living room. But we are standing in your living room. Exactly! Everything's right where it is in real life, down to the last detail. It's exactly like being here, only much more expensive. BOTH: Wow! (LAUGHING) Now, what are you boys all excited about? Is it too late to get something in the paper? The monster! Whoa, slow down, boys. I can't understand what you're saying. You're not gonna believe what happened. It all started... That's quite a tale, boys. Don't you believe us? Well, it's just that... People have been telling tall tales about that forever! You need concrete evidence. Should we show him now? Show me what? Mr. Dink, meet Herman Melville. The monster of Lucky Duck Lake. Oh! Hello, Bluffington Gazette? This is Bud Dink. Has tomorrow's edition gone to press yet? I have big news. You mean to tell me he came out of that polluted lake? SKEETER: Yeah! DOUG: You bet! Herman, don't eat that. (WHIMPERS) It's the story of the century, Mayor Tippi. This may be bigger news than we think. Bud, hang up. Dear. If you wanna keep Herman out of danger, hang up that phone now. (GULPS) (GASPING) Mayor Tippi, are we gonna tell people about Herman Melville? If we call the newspaper, owned by Bluffco, and tell them we've got a story that Bill Bluff is a polluter, someone will kill the story. And let's say it won't be good for Herman either. (HERMAN BURPS) (WHIMPERS) DOUG: So you're saying we can't tell anybody? SKEETER: No, Herman. Use this. No, we just have to tell them in a way that Mr. Bluff can't stop. We have to call a citywide press conference, make a big splash! That's a great idea. But until then we can't tell anybody about Herman Melville for his sake. Can you boys keep him absolutely secret till tomorrow? No problem! I'll have the press come here tomorrow. Meanwhile, tonight, we better keep him close by. We can keep him next door at my house. We just have to figure out how to keep people from seeing him. I think I have just the thing! What is going on? Mom! Judy Funnie, I don't care if you want to rehearse your plays at home, but please, muddy flippers off the carpet. Oh, she's... It's not Judy's fault, Mom. It's mine. I'll be down to clean it up. Wow! Sounds like Doug's learning some responsibility. Oh, our little man! Made it! Phew! (GROWLING) (BARKING) Be quiet. Doug, is something the matter up there? Everything's fine, Dad. Shh. (BARKING) SKEETER: It's nothing, Porkchop. See? (SNARLS) (BARKING) The one time in your life you decide to act like a real dog! Sometimes it takes pets a while to get used to monsters. Somebody puked? Judith Funnie, I don't think that's very nice! The least you could do is help him clean up your mess! My mess? My mess? (LAUGHING) My mess. Oh, my mess. What's gotten into her? Oh, you know... Judy. Can I call my parents, Mrs. Funnie? It's gettin' kind of late. Late? What time is... Oh, no! Patti! I was supposed to meet her at Swirly's. Gotta go! Oh, man, oh, man, oh, man! DOUG: I took every shortcut I could think of to get to Swirly's. And even some I shouldn't have. (FABRIC TEARING) Huh? Perfect. Great. DOUG: I was late, looked like mud and smelled like monster. But I knew I'd done the right thing. And I was hoping Patti would understand. Yeah, she was here a long time. She looked kind of upset. Then she left with a guy who kept talking about his big plans for some dance. Ah! Thank you. GUY: I see spotlights, dozens of them. Every color of the rainbow. Huge spinning hearts. It'll be big, big, big! Wow, that is big. We're a great team. Do you know that? DOUG: Hey, guys. How did you get in here? Bought a ticket. Patti, can I talk to you alone? We're a little busy right now, Doug. What is it? I came to apologize for being so late to Swirly's. I had a good reason. Something happened. But I can't explain it now. Oh. Couldn't get permission from your mommy? Come on, Patti. We don't have time for this little kid stuff. We have proof Mr. Bluff's polluting the lake. That's why I... Hold it right there. Shh. Listen, pal, if I were you, I wouldn't go around saying stuff you can't prove. Well, I've got proof! What proof? I can't say. Right! Well, you better watch yourself. Mr. Bluff got us into Funky Town to have a dance. If he hears you've been shootin' your mouth off, we might be stuck dancing in the school parking lot! (LAUGHING) PATTI: What's the matter with that? If Doug's right, isn't the truth more important than having the dance at Funky Town? (STAMMERING) I haven't heard any truth, for one! People have been saying dumb stuff like that for years. You'll see tomorrow. It's gonna be big, big, big, big news! Patti, in the meantime, I just came by to tell you I'm sorry I was late, but you'll see why tomorrow. See ya, Doug. (GASPS) What's that? Oh, nothing. Nothing, babe. I'll be right back. Gotta make a call. So I told Coach Spitz I'm not allowed to sweat. And he looked at me really mean. Then he says to give him five laps. (WHISPERING) Can I sue him, Daddy? This better be important! Yes, Guy? A picture of what? (SHOUTING) Of what? (SNORING) I talked to Mayor Tippi. The news conference is tomorrow night in her front yard. This will be so great. I have to make sure Patti comes. Then she'll understand about Swirly's. I wonder what shoes I should wear. You boys are up awful late. Telling scary stories? (CHUCKLES) Oh, kind of, Mr. Funnie. Holler if you want me to check under the bed for monsters. BOTH: No! (BARKING) (BARKING) My parents are gone all day, Herman. You stay here. We'll be back after school, okay? We gotta do something about Porkchop, man. If he doesn't chill out, the police are gonna come. Yeah, he's going nuts. Whoa! (BARKING) Porkchop, no! I want you to be nice to Herman Melville. I think we've all learned something here. I think I like the barking better. Our people have located monster tracks coming toward town. We have agents in the air, on the ground and one is underwater. Not good enough! We have to find that monster now! It must be crushed! That was my lunch, sir. PATTI: A press conference? Wow! Whatever you found must be important, Doug. Trust me. It's happening on the Dinks' lawn. We've sort of got something in the house we can't show anybody, but will you come? I'm pretty busy with... Please! Sure, Doug, of course. I'm glad you trust me about this after I... You know, Swirly's. Forget it, Doug. Just don't do it again or I'll brain ya! You'll find out everything tonight, Patti. It'll all make sense. Gotta run. See ya. Doug? Yeah? Should I bring Guy? Why do you wanna bring him? Since it's news, and he is head of the school newspaper and all. Sure, bring Guy. Perfect. I hope Herman Melville's okay. Don't worry. He's safe with Porkchop. Besides, nobody knows he's there. Mr. Bluff, they found it! They found the monster. Some kid's house. We surrounded it. Good! Very good! (SIRENS WAILING) Move it! Go! (PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC) (MASHING KEYS) I wonder who's car that is in front of your house? Probably just some reporter. MAN: (ON RADIO) Around the back. I don't see anything. (PLAYING PIANO) Prepare to move in. Check. Ready? All right, freeze! Hey, ready to be on TV? Okay, hand over the monster. Wrong garage, I'm afraid. No monsters here. Yet! (ALL LAUGHING) Sir, I think we have the wrong house. He says he has something inside his house? Huh? Really? Sure, I think I can come. Just have to make a phone call, babe. Look at the bright side, Mr. Bluff. It's not so much like they got the wrong house as much as they eliminated a house. No monster here. Quiet! What time? Perfect. Looks like our monster's comin' to us. Call our guys down at the press, and get a few trucks. I'd like to thank you all for coming this afternoon. Lot of reporters out there. This is gonna be so great! I don't know, man. What's the matter? I got a funny feeling about this. Maybe we should forget about the whole thing. Are you kidding? You wanna stop now? I don't know, I'm asking. Wouldn't it be safer for Herman if we took him to the lake and forgot all this? Take him back? But... You mean... Uh, we had a monster. Swear. But we let him go! Yep! Sure did, no lie. What a pair of liars! BOTH: Huh? I told ya! Now kiss me. No, Skeet. We gotta do this, 'cause it's the right thing to do. You just had a fantasy about Patti, didn't you? No. Well, kind of. You always get that blurry look. But do you really want everyone to think you either were crazy or lying all this time when you said there was a monster? They'll never believe you if you don't show them Herman. I guess you're right. Well, better get out there. See you in a minute, Herman. I'd like to introduce Mosquito Valentine, who'll tell you the story in his own words. (REPORTERS MUMBLING) Thank you, Mayor Tippi. (HONKS) (IMITATES OLD-FASHIONED KLAXON) (POPS LIPS) (HUMMING) Sorry. Always wanted to do that on TV. (CLEARS THROAT) Four months ago, I was fishing at Lucky Duck Lake... This is pointless. We should be working on the dance. Shouldn't you be here anyway? After all, you're head of the school paper. I couldn't get this story in the paper if I tried. What do you mean? We have this dinky, little crank mimeo machine. It takes two weeks to get the news out. It's ancient history by then. If I want a story to come out on time, I have to write it before it happens. That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard of. She made it! Patti made it! See, Herman, that's her. The one with the yellow hair. That's her! That's Patti! I can't wait to take you out there and show you. Hmm, that's funny. The speech is supposed to be going out live, but it's not on any of the channels. Hmm. What are you so fidgety for? Nothing. Nothing. It was here that I first had contact with the monster. And so, let me reveal our discovery, which will prove once and for all that there is a monster. Hey, watch it, buddy! SKEETER: And now, I guess it's time to talk about what happened at my house. My friend, Doug Funnie, with an "I-E," will help me. Hey, Doug! (GULPS) All right! He's comin'. Well, I'd like to say, um... (CAMERAS CLICKING) Something's not right. I think we made a big mistake. Huh? Mr. Funnie, is this your idea of a joke? No, that's not what I... I'm not saying... I'm sorry. I gotta go now. I knew it! Sea monsters! Right. I can't believe it. What a major con artist! (SIGHS) I can't believe you dragged me to this joke! PATTI: I'm really sorry about this, Guy. I had no idea Doug would lie like that. Wait! Stop! There he is! Can I just have a word with you, please? Let me just... Patti! Patti! Well, it's about time. Okay, let's see it. May we present... Robocrusher! You lamebrains! It's dinky. Didn't you look at my plan? It's supposed to be this big compared to me. Exactly. Whoa! You dipsticks! This is wrong! Change me back! Change me back now! Can we do that? BOTH: Mmm-mmm? What happened, Doug? Why didn't you tell 'em about the monster? What's going on? Look. (HERMAN WHIMPERING) He's trying to thank you for saving him, man. Well, tell him to stop it. (GRUNTS) (MUMBLING) Huh? Your head itch, Herman? No, he means Patti. And he's right. She must think I'm a big liar now. You did the right thing, Doug. I'm proud of you. I've been tellin' people all year there was a monster in the lake. They thought I was making it up. Now they'll never believe me. Bill Bluff is going to stop at nothing. We know that now. We have to do what's right. Even if everybody thinks we're big, fat liars? You boys don't want anything to happen to Herman. And I know you wouldn't want to make yourselves look good if it would hurt him. Right, boys? BOTH: Right. You have to do the right thing no matter what people think. Eventually, the truth will come out. What do you say we have some of Bud's famous leftover meat loaf? BUD: Now you're talkin'. Let's go, boys. What kind of loser nerds can't even build a stinkin' robot right? Where did they put that pile of junk? Ah! My room! What happened to my room? You don't expect me to leave that atrocious mess, do you? Now, let's change out of that beastly outfit and into something more presentable. (SCREAMING) It's only a matter of time. They have to leave the house sometime. And when they do, bam! We strike. Daddy, what are you talking about? Oh... (STAMMERING) baseball, princess! Ooh! That game has dirt! Please don't talk about it when I'm eating. Of course, Beebe doll. Whatever you say. ROBOCRUSHER: ♪ Lullaby ROGER: Stop it! ♪ And good night Please, stop it! ♪ Sleep is softly around you Oh, my back! You gotta stop singin'. ♪ Lay you down now ♪ And rest... ♪ It's only 8:30. (HUMMING) No, no. (CONTINUES HUMMING) Oh, there. I'm gonna get those guys! DOUG: The next morning, I left for school early. I wanted to explain things to Patti as soon as I could. But I kind of got this creepy feeling. The ducks are on the pond. The ducks are on the pond. (MEN CHATTERING ON WALKIE-TALKIES) DOUG: I didn't know what it was exactly, but I kind of felt like somebody was watching me. Hmm. Happy Valentine's Day, Beebe. Sorry. Sorry, I don't take valentines from lie-y lieface liars! Oh, man. MAN: (ON WALKIE) We're movin' in. Move. Move! Move it! Move! Up, up. Go! Up! Freeze, sea beast! What the... Well, as mayor, I mean, principal, I am honored to welcome this new exchange student to our illustrious school. Welcome. (WHISPERING) What's her name? Well, Principal White... Principal White? Hmm. Why does that name sound so familiar? No, it's Herman... (MUMBLES) Nooniny. Ah, what a beautiful name. Herman Nanoo-Niny. Welcome to our school, young foreign person. Vote for me. (ROARS) What did she say? Thanks. She said thanks. I want everyone to let their emotions flow onto the canvas. Hermione, no! Bad! That's dirty. (GASPS) Hermione, remarkable work! So primitive! So free! (BELCHES) Hermione, no! Huh? (SCREECHES) PATTI: Look at Doug with that cute girl. Huh? BOY: Ah! Girl in the boys' room! GIRL: Don't you just love her clothes? So retro. What do you call the perfume? "Pollution"? Is that new? You're too cool. GIRL: Can I ask you if that's, like, real, or or mousse in your hair? Hmph! Uh, Patti, I have to talk to you. Thanks for the Valentine, Doug! What Valentine? Oh! I'm sorry. I've been busy... So I see. I wanna tell you something, but you can't tell anybody. Right? We found the Lucky Duck Lake monster. That's why I didn't come to Swirly's the other night. Where are you going? I'm not gonna stand here and be lied to. I'm not blind. I know who you're really spending your time with. What are you talking about? That Hermione girl you've been hangin' around with all day. That's who I'm talking about! Then why don't you act like a grown-up and just say you're hanging out with her now? But I'm not! Well, I am, but I'm not really... Oh, really? I saw you all over her in the cafeteria. Come on, Patti. She's not even a girl. I know you think I must be dumb because I believed that monster stuff. But I hope you don't think I'm that gullible, Doug! Hello, kids. Oh, Doug. I see you're still pestering Patti. Sorry. We have to get to Funky Town. See ya, Doug. But... (SCHOOL BELL RINGS) I thought it over. We can't take him to our houses anymore. It isn't safe. See ya, Hermione. See ya tomorrow! There's only one thing left to do. We have to get him back to the lake before Mr. Bluff gets him. I'll take him there now. Get your camping gear and meet us. Whatever. Okay. Come on, Doug. We gotta do this, man. DOUG: Yeah, I know. Crossing. DOUG: I thought it had been the worst day of my life, but I was wrong. Things hadn't even started to get bad yet. Whew! Sure is cold tonight. Herman, can you hand me some wood? Well, we're back where we started. Only everyone thinks we're liars and Patti hates me. But other than that, yes, we're right back where we started. Well, at least Herman Melville will be free. (TWIG SNAPPING) Did you hear something? DOUG: Yeah. Over there. (GASPS) What is it? I guess those guys were in a hurry the other night. (HERMAN GROWLS) No, Herman! Too big. Little sticks. Tiny, little... Maybe we better get him back in the water. Yeah. This is it, buddy. Time to get in the water. Come on. Come on, back in the water. Come on! What's the matter? (SQUEALING) Maybe he'll go in if we swim with him. Take off your pants. Me? You take off your pants. It's too cold anyway. Just pretend. Here we go. We're gonna go swimming! Swimming! Come on, buddy. Swimming, yeah! Yeah, great idea. Come on. Don't you want to swim with us? (BOTH GASP) Ow! Hey! Herman, what are you doing? You hurt Doug. Hey! Stop it, you big fish! I'm glad we're getting rid of you. You're bad news! You lost me the only person I ever cared about. And now I wish... SKEETER: Look! Wow! No wonder he didn't want us to go in there. I knew it was polluted, but not that bad. Mayor Tippi was right. He can't go back there. What? I think you hurt his feelings, man. I'm sorry. Thanks for saving us, Herman. He can't go back in that lake, man! What are we gonna do with him? I think I can answer that. Run, Herman! MAN: Cut him off! Go, go, go! (SCREECHING) MAN: He's down! BOTH: Herman! Leave him alone! (SQUEALING) This'll knock him out for a while. Get him out of here. You can't do this! Quiet! I don't want to hear anything from you. If I hear one more peep, it's gonna... You're gonna be so... Bob? It won't be pretty for you. Right. You boys decided you were gonna make me look bad. I have friends at your school. You boys could be in middle school for a long time to come. If you know what's good for ya, you'll forget everything that happened here tonight. What do we do now? We gotta stop him. I don't care if I'm in middle school the rest of my life! Me neither! Let's go. I just hope I don't have to keep taking band. What I'm saying is, sure Superman's stronger than Batman, but Batman's got superior technology. Say my donut's kryptonite. Whoa! (SCREAMING) (TIRES SCREECHING) What is it, boys? (PANTING) They've kidnapped our friend! (SIREN WAILING) Take a left. (SIREN WAILING) OFFICER: There must be some mistake. This is Bill Bluff's house. He's the one! He kidnapped our friend! Hey, boys, that's a serious charge. Mmm. We're telling the truth. You have to hurry. They're going to kill him if we don't do something. (DOORBELL RINGING) Sorry to bother you, Mr. Bluff. (YAWNS) What seems to be the problem, Officer? Um, these boys seem to think you know where their friend is. What does this friend of yours look like, boys? You know what he looks like. He's this tall, and he's slimy and scaly. It's the monster from the lake. What? What are you two trying to pull? Now, now, Officer. I was a kid, too. But I assure you, I'm not hidin' any scary monsters in here. Why, Beebe wouldn't allow it. Except for some of the boys she goes out with. (LAUGHING) Yeah. But, Mr. Officer... Maybe you boys better go back to bed. But we... That's enough. Let's get you boys home. Sorry to bother you. Don't mention it. Hmm. One potato, two potato, three potato... (SIGHS) (WHISTLING) Hmm. Oh, sir. What the... Hey! Don't touch that. Okay. Mr. Bluff, they're waiting for your word, and they'll, uh... Dispose of the monster. I don't know. Those kids have got people suspicious. If this gets out, let's just say I don't need any more bad press. It's a fish, right? Whenever we had a fish go belly up... Whoosh. Down the toilet. Nobody's the wiser. Need a big toilet for a fish that size. I know where to get a big toilet. What's a toilet like that gonna cost? Less than you think. Enough! Here's what we're gonna do. Instead of keepin' this quiet, we're gonna tell everybody! You feeling all right? Boys, this is our chance to stop this bad press once and for all. We're not just gonna get rid of him. Bill Bluff is gonna save the town from this monster. DOUG: That night I couldn't sleep. My brain wouldn't shut up. You boys could be in middle school for a long time. I know you think I must be dumb because I believed... I think you hurt his feelings. We might be stuck dancin' in the school parking lot. Seeing a monster is cooler... If you know what's good for you, you'll forget everything that happened here tonight. Guy has real accomplishments, and he's friends with my dad. I know your dad. Not like he does! (LAUGHING) (SCREAMING) No! DOUG: The next morning it dawned on me. I was using Herman to try to impress Patti. I wasn't thinking about what would happen to him until it was too late. Now I had a chance to try to save him. My last chance. There was only one person that could help me get through to Mr. Bluff. It was about time to swallow my pride. Have you seen Guy? Yeah. I think I saw him in the news office. Guy? DOUG: At least he had been there. (GROANS) Huh? DOUG: That's when I saw it. Oh, no! I've been lookin' for ya everywhere, man. What is it, man? On the screen. Next week's Weekly Beebe. SKEETER: "Monster Destroyed. "Bill Bluff a Hero." We're too late. Herman's dead. This stinks. Everything stinks. They killed Herman. This stinks! "Night of fun turns into night of terror "when monster rampages through school Valentine dance." "The horrible monster was blasted into smithereens, thus saving the dance "organized by cool upperclassman Guy Graham." Of course, he had to mention his dance. Wait, that's... The dance isn't until tonight! What was I thinking? Of course. Guy wanted to make sure this was in next week's paper. This isn't what they did. This is what they're going to do! Mayor Tippi! (PHONE RINGING) BUD: Uh, Dink residence. Oh, hello, Douglas. Oh, I'm sorry. Mr. Bluff asked Tippi to fill in for him at a charity function in Boatsburg. Can I connect you to our very expensive voice mail? Let's see. You press two... No, that's okay, Mr. Dink. Thanks. Mr. Bluff even got to Mayor Tippi. She's out of town. (SIGHS) What are we gonna do, man? We've only got a few hours. We're gonna get some real help. The police? Even better. (PHONES RINGING) BOTH: Hello. Sleech residence. DOUG: We only have a few hours left. We have to save a life, so it's important we get everything right. Here's the deal. I've got it! Four, seven, two, nine. And a half. (ALL CHATTERING) DOUG: Well, that's it. We better get going, and hope we get it right. Wait a minute. Oh, no! What is it? Even if we get Herman Melville free, what are we gonna do with him? We can't take him back to the lake. That's right. It's totally polluted. (PORKCHOP YAPPING) What is it, Porkchop? I believe your canine friend is pointing to something on the map. Hmm? Porkchop, you're a genius! What is it? Funky Town is next to Lucky Duck Lake, but the back exit leads to Crystal Lake. That's where we're taking Herman. We know what to do. Let's go. 8:14. Ready? And, mark. What did you just push? This cool light. Ah! Joey cucamonga! Give me a heart attack, why don't ya? I brought you this. That jacket may be fashionable, but it's certainly not warm enough. No! (PEOPLE CHATTERING) ♪ Deep, deep water Firmer I will stand ♪ Deep, deep water And be who I am... ♪ COMMANDER: The area is secured. Is target visible? Are all our men in position? Why aren't you boys dancing? Duh... You mean, with a girl? I'm eatin' snacks. I have to go to the bathroom. Huh? Oh, man! This is good punch, eh, Elmo? Excuse me, Mr. Guard, sir. I'm expecting a truck to come from Bluffco in a few minutes. No, no trucks due tonight. You sure there's not one parked nearby, gonna pull up at 8:30? Kind of big? Smells fishy? No? Maybe I'll just wait and see. I got royally jinxed! I demand you make this thing leave me alone! No problem, Roger. Why didn't you ask? Robocrusher, 46-21. Oh! Oh. Well, it's about time! Hmph! Phase one complete. Roger. What? Uh... Nice jacket? Yeah, right. Hey, lookin' for someone? Guy, you scared me! (LAUGHING) (GROANING) Are you sure nothing's supposed to show up around 8:30? From Bluffco? Nope. They made their delivery hours ago. Oh. (GASPS) Nobody's dancing. Maybe we should go out and break the ice. You took the words right out of my mouth. Only, let's wait a couple of minutes. Why? Because I said so! Uh, I mean, let's just wait. Over here, please. SKEETER: (ON RADIO) Herman's already here. What? They've already got Herman here someplace. Look around quick! 8:30! He must be right in the middle of everything! In the middle? COMMANDER: Stand by. Wait for it. The heart! Oh, Guy. DOUG: I had to make the hardest decision of my life. Going after Patti, or saving Herman. Just in time, sir. We're just about to break the heart. What is he doing? COMMANDER: H-hour is approaching. Hold your fire! Get these kids out of the way! (HERMAN GROWLING) No, Herman! Stay! Stay! Come on, Skeet. Let's get him out of here. Ooh! I'm a monster. It's over there. It's over there! Go, go, go! COMMANDER: Fire! SKEETER: I think we're ready. Get the wig. Okay, okay. DOUG: Come on, Herman. My goodness! A crazed monster! Thank goodness I alerted Mr. Bluff's agents in time to protect the citizens of Bluffington. Coming through. Coming through. COMMANDER: Approach with caution. Approach with caution. What the... Roger? Roger. So, Funnie, take this. Take him! (CROWD SHOUTING) What is it? Looks like clean underwear, sir. (GROANS) (ALL PANTING) Here you go, Herman. It's clean water. Go. Go! This is it. You have to go. Hurry before they get here. This is your new home! Not now, Herman. Not now. Huh? There it is! Freeze! Go! All right! Go, Herman, go! MAN: Watch it! Where is it? The monster's in the lake, Mr. Bluff. Ten miles long and five miles wide. You're welcome to start looking. You! You two must think you're pretty smart! We'll see how smart you are when I get through with you. From now on, I will dedicate every wakin' hour to makin' the rest of your days a livin', writhing, pain-wracked nightmare! BEEBE: Daddy, knock it off! But, sugar pie, I was just tryin'... Doug and Skeeter are my friends, such as they are. If you have something to tell them, please discuss it with me. But, Beebe-kins, honey, I... Bill, I think you should discuss your pollution problems with me. Mayor Dink! Yes, of course. Certainly! Certainly! It's cold out here. Shouldn't you kids be inside dancing? Patti, I've been trying to call you. Looks like you were busy. This? This is what we disguised the monster in. Not that again. But it's true. See, he was... He was like a friend to us. He was so great. I wanted to tell you more than anybody, but I couldn't. I didn't want to put you in danger, or get him into trouble... (GASPS) Are you okay, Patti? (GROWLING) Herman! What are you... Mon... Herman. I'm glad you came back. I forgot. I brought you something. Remember this? Herman Melville's works? It's not only a memento, it's a tasty snack in case you get hungry. No, it's good! I tried it. You were right. Mmm, yummy. Mmm. What is it, Herman? Is something the matter? Did... Did you pick this for me? Is it for Skeeter? Mmm-mmm. DOUG: Patti? Mmm-mmm. Porkchop. (BARKING) (BARKING) I think I've got something in my eye. (GASPS) Who gave you that? Hmph! How could you? Oh, please. All this fuss over a big, stinky lizard? I may throw up. We're outta here. You comin' or what? Guy! What? You're outta here. Good-bye, Herman. (SNIFFLES) I hope you like your new home. And I'll miss you. Wait! Hmm? I'll miss you, too, man. You're my friend. ALL: See ya. I can't believe I let Guy fool me like that. Sorry I didn't trust you, Doug. None of it would have ever happened if I hadn't been trying to impress you. What, Doug? Sounds like the dance started again. (MUSIC PLAYING IN DISTANCE) What were you going to say? Well, I... Hey! Psst! Funnie! Yoo-hoo. Just a second. Every time I get a chance... I just want to thank you and the guys for getting rid of my, uh, robot problem. That's okay. No problem, Roger. Thanks, man. You're a... ROBOCRUSHER: There you are! You forgot your jacket. (SCREAMS) Roger? Roger? Roger. Well, maybe we could... Should check out this dance, huh? Or not. Okay. Cool. We can hear the music from here. Oh. So you just wanna listen? No. Oh. Oh! You mean, you... (STAMMERING) Do you... Would you... Sure. (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) What are you thinkin' about, Skeet Skeet? Fractals. Oh. But look. Doug and Patti are dancing. Doesn't that give you any ideas? Mmm... Um... No? Skeeter Valentine, dance me! DOUG: So, journal, that was Valentine's Day. Up to the last minute, I worried that everyone, especially Patti, would think I was a big loser. But like Mayor Tippi said, it's important to do the right thing, no matter what anyone else thinks. And maybe because we followed her advice, things are a little better in Bluffington. Mr. Bluff volunteered to clean up Lucky Duck Lake. And Patti and I danced on the dock under the moon for quite some time.
