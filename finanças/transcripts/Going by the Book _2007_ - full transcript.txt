Jeong Jae-young Son Byung-ho Investment by Kim Joo-sung Written by Jang Jin, Lee Gyu-bok Directed by La Hee-chan Going by the Book Sam-po City Hall Intersection Obey Signal Excuse me. Oh, yes. You made an illegal left turn. Show me your license, please. Oh, I'm not really familiar with the roads here. And I'm running late. Alright. I'll do this as quickly as I can. Hey, I'm really in a hurry here. Let's talk about this later. These issues should be handled as they come, sir. My name is Lee Seung-woo. I'm the new chief for Sam-po Station. Sir! Sam-po Traffic Department's Jung Do-man reporting! It's an honor to meet you, sir. - Sir. - Yes? I still need to see your license. Salute! Eyes Front! Attention! - Salute! - Greetings, chief! This way, please. This station's pretty quiet. Is it because it's a small city? Sir! Everyone's waiting for you at the assembly hall. Sir, the inaugural ceremony is today. Right... Let's just say we had one, and get to work. Sam-po Police Station Fair Governing, Friendly Service - Sir... - Where should I pay this? Pardon? He happened to make a left turn where it wasn't allowed. And he came straight toward us. So naturally, Do-man caught him with his animalistic instinct. You idiot! That's not animalistic instinct. That's animalistic behavior! How can you issue a ticket... when you should've been giving welcoming bouquet! Do-man Will you please loosen up, man? I thought I could have some peace after you left our department. But aren't you a genius at causing trouble! That's a talent, too. What a remarkable talent. Hey! Do-man. You did nothing wrong. Enough. Hey, you shouldn't be issuing tickets. And blowing whistles. You are too smart for all this crap. Why should you be crying, why? I'm not crying. Shit! You... You are a crime fighter. You are detective Jung Do-man of the police force! That crappy weasel governor... How can he do this to you? How can you put up with this! Do-man! I... I will get you back to work! I'm going to get you back to the investigation department. The pending issues are pretty trivial compared to the size of this city. Public safety during the tourist season Gambling prevention. Recent cases of bank robbery One, two, three, four and five. This is my observation. Based on our history of bank robberies, you can see a general trend from the data we have. With the city as the center, the robberies have been here, here, and here. As you can see, the second, third, fourth and fifth cases. have been getting further away from the center of the city. That means our situation is getting better. And, this is based on my instinct, but when the flowers bloom, in mid-March, the beginning of spring, I believe that our city will be no longer. inside the perimeter that is subject to bank robberies. Thank you. In the past few years, land prices have been soaring. because of rumors of development. With that came population increase, and that created more banks And compared to other districts, the rate of savings is high in Sam-po. Yes, so... that'd mean people have that much more money If you look at past records, this area has been particularly notorious for its robbery problems. And that may be due to the negative karma of this land Is the shift planning for the crime department finished? Oh, yes. And we've increased patrol for vulnerable time slots. There will be no more robberies, sir! I'm at Jin-heung Bank, where a robbery occurred approximately an hour ago. According to the employees and eye witnesses on the spot... Don't know about he robber's age... The robber seems extremely bold. So far, there's been no leads and this is unsettling to the neighborhood residents and banks. Sam-po Police Station A Civil application What the hell are you guys doing? Banks are continuously being robbed! How can we go to any bank? Wake up and do your jobs! Cops! Yes. Oh, hi! A tough first day, huh? Well, we always get criticized That's part of our job. Oh, I was going to call you when I heard you had moved down here. - Did you family move down with you? - Nah. I don't think I'll be here long anyway. It's just what I have go through to work in central office. I'll be here 6 months, at the longest. Blow through here. Mister! Hey, I am an old fart from this neighborhood. It's dangerous. From that corner... I can go on my own. I'll be careful. Wait. Bravo! Cheers! Bravo! One more round! It's very realistic. Poor men are getting their butts frozen. Wow, they're working their butts off. It's just like the 80's. - Sir. - Excuse me. - Thank you for your cooperation. - We're doing training right now. Drive safely. Sir! God speed! God speed! So what if he is a governor? He didn't even look busy. The training sucks. A training should be more realistic. Whew... Your cap's robbered. Simulation training? Yes. As you just heard, we're going to simulate a robbery. And you are doing this due to recent robberies. Was this your idea, Chief? There once was a similar case back in 1929, during the 2nd Oil Shock Crisis. A chain of bank robberies broke out in Kim-po, Gyeonggi. Through a similar training, the police and banks collaborated to come up with measures. and a hotline network was created Later the robber was caught. This training will serve as working ground to ease the anxiety of our residents, to help people feel assured about financial business, and convert the nation's ill opinions about this city. It won't simply be a training to fight bank robbers. What do you mean by not having a set scenario? This training will not have a set play of actions. We'll show you how well, how quickly we respond to matters as they break open. Will there be any awards? Yes. Depending on the results of training and your accomplishment, you may be promoted. I want this to be clear The title of your role isn't important. Please give your best at the position your given. Even if you are the robber. Do-man, what are you? It's a secret. I know that we won't be told when the training happens, but it'll be during the working hours. Our performance will be publicized on TV, radio and newspapers, It's important that you respond calmly and flexibly. This will affect the end of the year employee evaluations. So let's try to get back the trust of our residents, alright? So the training will start without prior notice on that day? We're busy enough Why do we have to do this? Oh, this is going to be fun. Hey, hey, so we might get on TV. What fun are you talking about? I knew something annoying would come up before this year ends. Hey, hey. Let's stop complaining and just do this. We just need to let it happen. What are we supposed to do when a real robber comes? I wasn't here the last time it happened. You just give him all the money. Say, 'Goodbye, come back and see us'. If you try anything different, you'll get killed. We're having this training to change that way of thinking. You have nothing to say! You didn't even show your face. Oh... That time... I had trouble hearing. - Does he have a hearing problem? - That's just the way he is. Ms. Jeon. What are you doing coming to work so late? I had something urgent to take care of. At this early hour? Yes. I had to do something as soon as the bank opened. Hey, you! How come you go to other bank, when you work here! Unbelievable... That's actually a bigger crime than bank robbery. - Mr. Yoon. - Yes. Where did we leave off? - I will... take care of... - Enough, Enough. Put on a mask, will you? Yes, yes. It'll be interesting. The purpose is to make us look better, so give us a good coverage. Yes, thank you for your help. - Yes. - Yes. Come in. Yes. Yes. Yes, I'll talk to you again soon. Alright, bye. You haven't been a traffic cop for long, have you? Forgive me for the other day, if I made you upset. It's just that that's what I do. No, no. I'm not annoyed by things like that. Don't let it bother you. Sit down, won't you? Yes, sir. Let me see what you picked. Excuse me? Show me what position you got. Patrol Team. Robber This slip wasn't in the drawing box in the first place. It's not a role that anyone can take on. You said there wasn't anything set. You're right. Nothing's planned. But we need to look good for the public, so we need a believable robber. Then... why did you pick me? You're one curious guy, aren't you? You just look the part. And I feel that you may have wanted to be a crook for once in your life. No, sir. It's not... I'm just joking. Just joking. Officers from the criminal investigation department, are good at catching crooks, but they aren't very sharp. And I didn't want just anyone to be the robber. - You might regret this. - What? It's just that I'm... not the kind of person you'd want... Jung Do-man I didn't call you here to negotiate. I'm your chief and You'll follow my orders. Yes, sir. Yes. Is there any special details that I should be aware of? What? Things such as... when and how I'll be caught... You're a funny guy. You just focus on robbing the bank. We'll catch you. Just do your best for your given role. This is my earnest request. Our dignity is at stake. Don't take it as a joke Be realistic. Like that time you gave me a ticket. Understood? Kyoung-tae... Oh, hi. - Where's my brother? - Your brother? He's at the station. Freedom! Hey! Wear your helmet! If your brother sees you, you are dead! Hello. Oh, officer Jung, you came right on time. Yes. Everything going well? If we don't have customers like you do, we will. What? We live off of late fees, not rental charges. So people like you who are never late don't really help us much. I see. Best Credit Bank Mr. Jung Do-man. Thank you. Greetings! Freeze! Please remember... you all will be always my loving family. And I'll always be... your loving son as well. Let's eat. Yes. Training Starts Now - I'm heading out. - Huh? Hey. You've got mail. Hey, hurry! Quick! - Mr. Yong-bae! - You have a good life ahead of you. Excuse me. Thank you. What are you? The robber? I am just a customer. I don't think so. I'm only a customer, like you. I'll show you something. Oh, you're part of the arrest team. Lucky you. Hey, but what if the robber goes to a different bank? Yeah... It's not as if there's only one or two banks in this city. Look who's here. It's Han. Hello. Maybe she's the robber. A female robber? Like that one from the movie Tomb Lady or something. - Hello. - Thank you. Hey, the guy with the mask. Isn't that Do-man? Jung Do-man. That is him! What's he doing in the bank when he should be working? Look how he's dressed. That idiot. Wait. Did traffic wardens draw for duties? Hello. How may I help you? Good morning. Don't be alarmed. I didn't have a choice. Please, stay calm. Don't scream. Put $10 bill stacks into this bag. Stop staring! Stuff the money, you bitch! Haven't you seen a robber before? I think we've met before... Which high school did you go to? The bell rang off. Who pushed the bell? What was that? I shot you! You shot me? I only asked you where you went to high school. You shot me for that? I saw your gun sticking out. Don't move! Stuff the money in now! Try your best not to move! I said freeze! Don't move! Don't move! Get your hands up! Hey! Why do you keep yelling at these people? - I have to act like a real robber. - Hey. We can all hear you, so stop yelling. You already look like a robber. So don't go overboard, huh? Everyone come out from the counter with your hands up. Come out now! Go, go, go! Move, move, move! - Come out! - Alright, Alright. - We don't have much time. Move it! - Hey, everyone. Don't be too alarmed. Watch out! He's just... a bit like that. So don't worry. You all got the official notice, right? Well, this is the training. So just come out as he says. I'm sorry, but you'll have to move also. Let's all cooperate. The head office requested for our cooperation. Mr. Yoon and Ms. Da-hae get the money ready, alright? - Alright. - Yes, Thank you. This way, please. Excuse me, Ma'am, but you have to step out as well. Who are you calling a ma'am? - Ms. Lee, hurry up and move please. - Come out. - There's not much time. Move quickly. - Be good with the money. We appreciate your cooperation. Yes, please cooperate with us. Thank you. Thank you for listening. There won't be any more casualties as long as you all cooperate. Raise your hands high! Come on people! Ah, yes. We've started. Yes, please give us good coverage. You know small town folks They love getting on camera. Yes, yes. It won't take long. Please cover us on your 9 o'clock news. Yes, yes. Yes, see you soon. Sorry? Oh, yes. It will be fun. Come out. Alright. - Oh! Who's on the scene? - Yes, there are about 10 hostages. No, I'm talking about our people. There are Cho Sung-wook and Han So-young as customers. And squad leader Woo Jong-dae was there undercover. - But he got killed. - What? Jung Do-man took a gun with him? Yes. Why did he have to complicate things for us. I don't understand. Yeah, really. What kind of cop asks a robber which high school he attended? What are you doing over there? If you're going to do this, do it right. Hey! I'm dead. Thank you for your cooperation. You are the bank manager, right? Yes, I am. You're the only one with your hands down. You might get shot! Woah... Hey, I can leave since I'm dead, right? No. Gain control over hostages Secure the emergency exit. Accomplished in 4 minutes and 20 seconds. He's jotting all this down. Come on, hurry. Those nasty cops may get here soon. Look at the way that freak talks. Don't you think calling us nasty is a bit harsh? Then what are you? A clean cop? Mr. Woo! Shut up. What's going on over there? If there's a crowd in front of a bank. You have two things happening. They are selling apartments, or there's a robbery. Hey. Make a U-turn. Aw... Why are you doing this? Let's go home please! Either you make the turn, or I jump out of the car. Greeting, Sir! Sir! Do-man's inside! What? No. No. - Why is he in there, Huh? - Should I tell him to Come out? He's the robber. - What? - What? - Hello? - Hey, this is me, your chief. - Oh, Yes. - Doing a good job There. Good work. But why did you kill Detective Woo? You might get slandered for that. Don't shoot. Well, I could've gotten caught I thought that wouldn't be good. Anyway, the camera isn't here yet, so keep it up for a bit longer, alright? And when the broadcasting goes out later, don't look fake. You understand me, correct? I thought this was supposed to be for real. Yes. Right. You're right. In about 30 minutes the SWAT guys will arrive. Don't be taken back. Never let them catch you. Yes, I'm doing all of these not to get caught, Sir. If they catch you, we, the police, won't look so cool. Also, we're going to finish this before they get here, but no matter what happens, don't be frightened. Don't get hurt, and be careful. Got it? Ugh. This is so frustrating! There's already a stack of work piled up. Boss! You'd better not say anything about this later. Let us just all cooperate It won't take long anyway. Who said that? Who said this would be short? The situation broke off at 12:32 PM. The first team got here just 7 minutes after. Although a member of our arrest team was shot, The hostages are all fine. By that you mean a cop was killed, correct? Was that arranged? Nothing had been planned in the first place. Take this as a real case. We're also responding to this as if it were real. No one knows when this training will end. See you at the 2nd briefing. What is all this? - Thank you. - He said the training was real. What? Hey! Do-man! I'm asking this because I'm really curious. You are the only robber. And there are these many hostages. How did you tie all of us up? Tied-Up This doesn?t make sense Yes. That's right! Hey! You tell us to do our role well, but what you do doesn't make sense. Your hands and feet have been tied up. You all have been taken in hostage. So are you saying you did everything by yourself? No. You did. Me? You tied everyone up. Then you tied your legs and cuffed your hands with Mr. Woo's handcuffs. Of course, during that whole time, I had a gun on you. In the case, I don't have to do anything to tie you guys up. Clear now? Wow... you tied all these people up, huh? Then you must be worn out now. Maybe that's why, but I am tired. Let me sit back down now. - I have a headache... Sorry - Good... for trying - Have everyone be ready. - Yes. Tell the news camera to follow us. Yes, sir. B team is ready. Broken Uh... Ex... Excuse me. All the security cameras are cut off. With this condition, we won't have a good way of knowing what's going on. I'm in the middle of training. The training. How long will it take for the SWAT team to arrive? They've just passed the downtown checkpoint. Hey! Do-man! Something's been accidentally touched, I think. The security cameras have been cut off and the shutters are down. We're about to go in. - I lowered the shutters. - What? Those things shouldn't be messed with. You might break them. Don't touch the bank's equipments. Well, sometimes robbers do. What? Jung Do-man! And. I'm about to answer no more calls. Hello? Jung Do-man! Jung Do-man! Excuse me... To how far have you talked this out with Do-man? What? What I mean is... Haven't you talked about when and how he's going to be caught? No. I just... told him to do his best. And try to be a robber if he can. Excuse me, but... why are you taking our cell phones and watches away? Since there isn't much cash in our branch, you should steal those things as well, shouldn't you? Mr. Robber. Aren't I right? No. Hostages shouldn't be wondering what time it is, how long it's been. I think it'd be better for you all not to. That's less stressful, and that won't get you thinking about trying something. Excuse me! I'm mentally and emotionally unstable right now So stop with this already. Miss Lee. What's wrong with you He's in the middle of public duty. Even if it is his public duty. This is too much We're not kids here. This is nothing but a training. He should be more considerate of us here. You made us sit on the cold floor and took our phones and watches. You're a real robber! A real crook! Officer Jung... Fainted Now that is quiet, let me summarize the situation for you. You the student and you grandpa can leave. I'll stay here longer I like it here because it's warm. Don't mind me. Just do your thing. Excuse me. Even though he doesn't have an account with us, he's our loyal customer. And you don't need to worry, he lives just right in front of here. Sit. Don't you have school? We have today off. Do you go to Sam-po High? Yes. That's odd. Then why did my son go to school? Ah... He must be goofing off somewhere else then! And one more thing. This is training, but it's not like other ones. I've taking on the role of a robber. And I may be harsh on you to the extent that you think of me as a real robber. So please, understand where I'm coming from. Don't move! Hey! If you move, I'm going to shoot! Hey! On your knees! On your hands and knees, idiot! - You died already. - On your hands and knees! - Hey, Mr. Woo. - The rifle! Give me the rifle! No! You follow my orders and lie down! Hey, I was too bewildered to think about this, but I was wearing a safety vest. - That's right! - Untie those people! - Get him! Get him! - Safety vests are standard for cops! - Hey, Do-man! Everything's over now! - That's right! Good thing I remembered! Excuse me, sirs! Can you wear a safety vest on your head? What, kid? You were shot on your head. - You were shot on your head? - I don't know. That's right. I think I saw that, too. You people! Do you have proof? - Here. - It was your head. See! I told you so! I was right! I have a good eye for these things! Yes! - Give me the gun. - It was the head. Give me the gun. Nice! The SWAT team is here. They're here. They're here? Everyone. Attention! At your service, sir! At ease. I'm the attack commander. What's up with the sudden training? One down already, huh. Those things happen on occasions. Shootings. This is what real training is all about. Responding to unplanned situations. Wow... when did you come up with this? The police headquarters has the right to command. So the SWAT team can wait for further instructions. According to the field manual, this would be the persuasion period. Look at this. There he is. He has just returned to the country. But they say he's an expert on hostage negotiations. He's been to the U.S. for training, and he's known to be pretty good at this. We haven't seen his skills at work yet, but we'll be able to see how he does with this one. Hey! We got enough footage. Let's go home now, or we're gonna get stuck in traffic. Don't just shoot here. Film over there. Zoom in this direction. Hurry! - Are you posting this on your blog? - Oh, and get him! Ah! It's cold! So we can't do anything until they try something? No, not yet. Why did that idiot lower the shutters! What's his deal? Oh! There's a way. Detective Han is in there. Officer Jung. Let me go to the bathroom. She was the winner of the 2003 Wu Shu Competition. Wu Shu! Detective Han is a master at it! These requests are usually not allowed. Follow me. But Officer Jung, he's also a competition winner. Oh, that... That's right. Boxing. Boxing or Wu Shu, which one is stronger? That's easy. The one with the gun. I'm here at the Best Credit Bank, where people have been taken in hostage for an hour and a half now. Another casualty has just been caused. The police force hasn't been able to do much as of this time. We'll have to watch and see how many more casualties happen. And see when the police will get it together and take control. That will be our focus. This is Kim Jee-kyung from Best News. Can't believe we're shooting this. Dead Maybe you all are too comfortable, because you're starting to get ideas. Please come off of the sofa. Onto the floor? He wants us to sit on the floor? Our butts will freeze. Good going, Han. Why did you have to bother him anyway? I have bad knees, so I can't sit on the floor. This is all because of you! Apologize now! How can we stay sitting on the floor? Ah... Shit! Shit? Sir? Can you watch your language? There's a baby in there. Hello. Hello, your son just passed away a few minutes ago. You can say that he died on duty, because he died during training. He... hello? Hello? You crazy bastard! Hey! Do-man! Have you gone mad? You jerk, are you insane? My mom has a weak heart! That crazy bastard! This phone. Hello? Ah, what's up with the battery? Aw, shit! I'm about to go nuts! Ah. Ah. Jung Do-man! I'm from the provincial police headquarters. My name is... I'm Jang Yeun-soo, in charge of liaison. Is he going through a voice change now? Aw. That guy has the cold, too. See! The cold virus going around these days is not a joke. First of all, what you are doing now... is a very serious and reckless crime. I hope you will realize that. Where's the medicine? Your house is in Jung Do-man's name. - That's my son. - I need his seal to issue this. This is for a loan, could you just let me slip by this time? No, ma'am. It's not there? Oh, then check the small drawer by that desk. The small drawer? I looked there already. So why did you put the house in his name anyway? Criminal Psychology Sir. Let's take this route here, and just push the building over. Did you come here to take out a building? Well, we can't just sit here and kill time, right? We will get in somehow! A cash box Physical action will start 60 minutes after persuasion and indirect conciliation. - Chief. - Yes. The security camera inside the safe is still working. Come and see. - Are we ready to send officers in? - Yes. Let's do this. Three, two, one. Let's go. - Manager. - Yes. Alpha, Alpha. State your location. This is Alpha. Moving to target. - Call the reporters. - Yes. Start. Now stationed. Starting mission. - Let's take a peep at the safe. - No... no... wait! Later. Does this building have an air circulatory system? Yes. There's air for people and air for money. Can you turn that off for a few minutes? What's wrong with this? Look at your cell phones. - There's no reception. - What's wrong with them? Boss! Just be prepared and take good footage. This will be the highlight of the day. - Chief, hold on. - Yes. There's a problem. You should come to the briefing room. - My crew... - The crew... Stop the mission immediately! Are you deaf? My men are about to die! Shit! Open. Now! If we opened the door 1 to 2 minutes later, you all might've been dead. Come out. All of you. Seven cops now dead. I'm reporting from the scene of action If this were real, then it'd be the worst case of hostages taken by a single individual. I called the headquarters. Please. Yes. Everything's ready. Just take a look at it. No, it's very interesting. Yes, alright. Thank you. Okay! A simulation? What dimwit thought of this great idea? Hey, a little ago, you said that this is how a real training should be. Aren't any of you hungry? Whatever you do, you should never leave your stomach empty. Oh! Da-hae, we ordered rice cakes for the bank's anniversary. Did they come? The umbrellas have, but not the rice cakes. Ugh! Hey! How long are you going to do this to us! Miss Lee! You scared me. Boss, would you have done this if the robber was real? Excuse me. But you are supposed to be unconscious. Unconscious? Unconscious, my ass! So what if I fainted! What! Huh? Hey! So if I did faint, should I stay unconscious all day long? I woke up, okay? Your punch was too light for me, so I woke up after I fainted! There! Keep on looking at me like that. Doesn't this make sense to you? Hey, you've done everything your way so far, why can't I? Right on! Hey, fool! Fainted people can wake up, you idiot! You are dead! Anyway, I don't care what you do, but do it yourself! Oh... what? You're gonna shoot me? What... You want me to fall over and pretend to die? Hah! Very funny! Raped We were friends from childhood. Even when we were young, he was always polite and pretty strong. People inside must be having a rough time. He should be coming out. Officer Jung used to be a crime investigator. Then he was demoted to a traffic cop. Yes. About 2 years ago, Do-man was after the governor's corruption scandal. This was a serious issue. We had a gut feeling, but we couldn't prove it. We don't know if that went to cash or bonds. We don't know because it was never figured out. Even if we did, it would've been like fighting with a giant with a stone. So what happened? The chief of that time was fired. And we started having robbers. He was demoted then. He went through a lot. Excuse me, but is it okay for me to say all of these? Hello? Oh yes, yes. Hold on, please. Chief, it's from the National Police Agency. This is Lee Seung-woo speaking. What? A national broadcast? This is a simulation training hosted by the Sam-po police station. You must be wondering how this came about. Now we can't end it even if we want to. - Ex... Excuse me. - Watch It. Hello. What station are you with? - Why do you ask? - What do you mean why I ask? What makes you think you can film here? Did you get prior permission? Get your vehicle out of here now. Now, please. Hey! Come over here. Help move this car out of here. Hurry! Should we take out ours as well? No. You can continue. That's not fair. How come one gets to report, and the other doesn't? This is a violation of freedom of speech, isn't it? No, it seems like media repression. This... this lady... is a real pain in the neck! I'm not 'this lady. ' I'm a TV journalist. What, you're just a reporter. The membership fee starts at $1000 dollars. The membership period is one month, up to 36 months. You'd perfectly fit our criteria. It's not good for women to sit on the cold floor. Ugh! - Have some coffee. - Thanks. Five. Save. I got that one. It feels real to be playing with checks. Here... Three! Yes! I won that one! Emergency, Time Out How do you feel right now? Please look this way! Just give us a word! Chief, just tell us one thing... Thank you for letting her go and not putting me in an awkward spot Are you going to resume soon? I should. What's your reason? Why are you going this far? I warned that you might regret this. But I'm a cop so if you tell me to stop right now. I will. So... you want me to end this? Let's see how far you go with this. Do your best until the end. Yes, sir. I'll take that as an order. Anyway, this is a relief. At least we have one fewer hostage. Is it over? When will the hostages come out? What will happen now? Sir... I'm not done. What? Hostage Exchange! Had I been a real thief, I wouldn't have let those hostages go. So to make this fair, I'll need someone to take their place. Fine. I'll go in. No. I'll pick the hostage. Should I just shoot him? Me? Me? But shouldn't he go in without the camera? If this is a fair one-to-one trade off, then he should leave the camera. The camera should be counted as a person since it has its eyes. I let two hostages go. A bit more! Push a bit harder! It's coming! It's coming out! My name is Da-hye. Yes, everything's set. Alright! I'm ready. Okay, relax. Talk as if you would normally. Okay, ready! So you've seen Al Queda and Hamath, It's obvious. Let's go without the gun, please. Alright. I'm currently the person playing the robber for the training. I'm officer Jung Do-man. Contrary to our expectation, this training has been extended, and is far from what you may have expected, but the police officers of Sam-po are willing to ensure. the safety of our residents and the peace in our city, at any cost. Also, I don't know how this training will end, but the purpose of this is to heighten our abilities to tackle the crimes that unexpectedly arise. I want to emphasize this one more time. Also, I would like to thank these hostages for their cooperation. Hey! You crazy fool! You aimed that loaded rifle at me! Um... Why is this in there? The bullet shouldn't be... Well, I didn't... What was that? Call them, huh? Hey! He told us to call them, what are you doing? - Hello, Where would you like to call? - Best Credit Union. - Alright. Which branch? - The Sam-po branch. Yes, in Joong-ang Dong. Joong-ang Dong. I have that for you - 337 - Yes? Yes. We got a call from the provincial police headquarters. I'll transfer the call to you. How are we supposed to fix this? Excuse me! Shouldn't we continue our filming? Yes, sir. Sometimes, even if you don't want to, a case can only be resolved if someone dies. Target obtained. Do I have to do this? I don't want to. Alright. That's fine. I'm not going to. Do I look alright? Okay... are you ready? - I'll give you a count. - Okay. Ready. Our... Best Credit Ba... Bank is... Cut, cut! You know, I think maybe it's better that you don't do this. Jeez, you are sweating. It's because the heater broke I feel chilly already. Wait. He has a fever. Hey, I really need to take my pills. Target Found. Direction Good. - Are you sure that is Do-man. - I'm positive. - Should I fire? - No, when he is completely still. There won't be any mistakes. He's still. Alright, fire! Okay, done. Got him on his head. Okay! Oh, wait. Does he wear glasses? What? With this, the number of casualties is now 8. The mistake of the police has caused another innocent person's death. The situation is continually deteriorating. Aw shoot. Let's do that over. Dead So would I qualify for accident insurance? Of course. That with life insurance and government compensation, You'll get quite a lot, huh? Will my seniority affect government compensation? Don't managers get more? Hey, officer Song! Yes. Eight people were killed so far. One by the police. Anyway, this is driving our chief nuts. Ah. Ah. Alright, let's start. You must speak normally. Okay! My son, Do-man... Do-man. This is your mom. You told me to talk normally. The word 'son' is very important here. My son, Do-man. This is your mom. Why are you doing this? Think of your parents. Why are you doing this? Think of your parents. If you surrender, we'll forgive you. Are you listening, Do-man? They say they're going to forgive you if you stop now. - Do-man. - I told her to say what I say! - I don't think this will really work. - Ah Ah. Do you think that I think this will work? I don't think he can hear me inside. This is going as I planned. If you have something to say to your son, go ahead. Do-man, where did you put your seal? I need it tomorrow But I can't find it. I know that you must be having a difficult time because of my son. But he has a good heart. You shouldn't have asked him to play the robber. I bet playing his part is ripping his heart out. What? What! Look here, ma'am. We never told him to do this. He became the thief by drawing. Drawing out of a box. Everyone here picked a role And your son, he picked his. Oh... I guess that's his luck then. Keep up the good work. What, weird lady. Yes. Yes. We're ready. News Tonight This afternoon, in Sam-po City, a training is becoming a hot issue. SWAT Team dispatched Sam-po Police Chief at a loss Now we only need to arrest him. 8 hours ' confrontation 8 casualties! Yes, at this moment, in Sam-po City, a unique simulation training is taking place. And it has evolved into an unexpected situation. Let's talk to our reporter on the scene. Jung Do-man. Do-man. We tried to persuade a robber through the robber's parent. And we failed miserably. That's because you are not a real robber. I missed that point. But it also means that you didn't do your job perfectly. You have the responsibility to be like a real thief. But if you were really playing the part, then you couldn't have been so apathetic. Why? Because she's your mother. So ultimately, you didn't do your job well. Maybe we'll talk about this after training. Officer Jung is speaking now. How come you call yourself an officer? You're a robber, bastard! You've been a robber all this time! Jung Do-man! Let me talk. My reason is simple. My mother didn't shed a tear. That's because she's a mother of a cop, not a thief. Every parent would have cried if her son were really a thief. This is the flaw of this simulation. I'm a robber but my mom is still a mother of an officer. That's why she didn't cry. That's why she didn't plead. I swear if my mom had really cried, I probably would've given in. J u... j u n... Jung Do-man! And one more thing. Please tell my mom that my seal is in my second drawer. It's now 9:35 PM Prepare a bus exactly by 10:35 PM, in front of the bank. Secure the road to Sam-po Harbor. And prepare a mid-sized boat at the time of arrival. Station all officers on roof of the building, across the street. I was notified of the start of training, but I will be the one to end it. The boat which I will get on, will go north. Near a territorial sea, I will release the hostages with life vests. When I leave the sea, the training will be over. I will not yield. And, if my requests are not accepted, I will kill a hostage every 10 minutes. How should we get the bus... - Are you nuts? - Right. No bus. Cancel that idea. A lot of people are here. Mr. Governor! What do you think about this training? Do you have any information? Did you have any prior knowledge? Ah... Let's do this later. - Was the meeting arranged already? - Why are you meeting him? Mr. Governor! So you know about that guy in there. He's quite a character. You'll suffer some damage. That's already happened. I'm saying this because you know him. But you also know that he has quite a temper, right? You'd better leave now. We don't want anything to happen. Isn't this just a training? My residents are uneasy because of the lack of public security. During a training like this, as a governor, I should make an appearance, - and give warm words of... - Excuse me. This is a very important training, but you're being slightly unhelpful. Darn! Yeah. What? You want more footage? You think we're some sort of troopers? The viewing rate for the 9 o'clock news was over 30%! The commercial aired already, so do a good job! I appreciate your hard work, but can you end it soon? It's time for me to clock out. How did you feel when you first found out you would have to be a thief? Well... It was... similar to how I felt when I first became a cop. I felt excited and exhilarated. Is it weird that I felt the same way both times? I see. As a robber, what do you think about this training? Well, I wish I'd be caught soon. I want to be caught. That may be how you feel, but as you well know, It seems like this training won't end anytime soon. As a robber, how do you feel now? How would a robber feel in this situation? As a robber, I feel anxious, because a lot of time has passed. I also regret taking on this role. I never intended to make people sacrifice this much. I resent myself because things don't seem to work out... I never wanted to kill or hurt as many as I have. Life is precious to anyone. Bang! Dead Officer Jung, why did you shoot me all of a sudden? That's because the police went over that deadline by 10 minutes. And you've been annoying him, pacing back and forth with your camera. I wasn't annoying him. I was only trying to film this... Hey, Do-man! You should've at least used your own gun. Every gun-user should know that is the basic etiquette. It's a jinx. As you know I've never shot anyone. You should listen to your superior... What's wrong with you, really? Are you getting pissed? - Stop, man. - Hey! Do-man... Bend down! Down low! Why do you... It'll be another 10 minutes soon. If there's no bus by then, one more will die. Stop this, please. We've been good so far. Get the troops out and call a bus! Everyone evacuate. Everyone evacuate. Snipers, be ready take your positions to fire. It's going to rain. No... Is that the only bus you could get? Yes, all public buses have stopped running, and there are no bus drivers at this time. Even if we find one, he'll probably be drunk. Even that bus was difficult to get We had to cancel its appointment. Do we really have to get on this? Wow. The whole crowd left. Even if we get on the bus, we won't go anywhere, will we? We'll probably be killed on our way to the bus. Several people died already. One or two more deaths wouldn't be a problem. And you! You've killed too many people You call this a robbery? This is terror. Hey, Do-man. I know you've worked hard I know you were told to. Right? Why don't you give up now? If I were a real robber, would I really get on that bus? If I were real. What if you don't get on? Huh? You think the police will just leave? Out of 13 of us, who is the one they are after, you fool! Huh. Is your brain too fried to think straight? 13 hostages? They don't know that Grandpa and I are in here. We haven't been on TV, either. Our target is on his way out. Who's Jung Do-man? Hold fire! Look for Do-man's pants. All of them have their pants rolled up... And none of them have hair on their legs. Oh, right! Look for a lefty! There are 3 left handed individuals. Uh... no... Wait, that's right. Look for a guy wearing a trench coat! Fire! Just fire! Fire! I said fire! Just shoot! Out! Out! Out of my way! How can I be driving this bus? Damn. It'd be different if I were heading to the police. Hey, no one else knows how to drive a bus. Ah, I can't believe I'm doing this I'm a cop for god's sake! How am I supposed to help out a robber, when I'm a cop! Hey, just let me drive then, I don't care. Oh, grandpa, you know how to drive a bus? Well, no. But you just need to step on it and turn the wheel a couple of times Just drive. Unless you want us all dead! Wait, Wait. - Can you turn on the heater? - Yes! - What a crazy bunch! Ugh! - What about the radio? Report the inside situation. No one's in the bank, sir. We'll evacuate. They're leaving. They left. They left? Yup. Whoa, it's cold. You're observing the traffic signals? That doesn't fit with this whole scenario. We are supposed to be fleeing, you know. I'm just observing the signals. How is that a problem? Traffic gets chaotic because of people like you! You know how hard our traffic cops work to keep order? Oh, Jung Do-man. Now he's a nut case. It's a bit chilly, isn't it? Yes, a little. Hey... when are we leaving? You have the key to the manager's car, right? Oh, no! Aww... What am I supposed to do with this? They're all gonna get stuck together. Aw, shoot... 10 million won Are you okay? I'm still a robber, right? That's my house. A boat is really coming in. Wait... who...? Good work. Do-man that bastard! Give us a smile. Our target has fled. Notify all check points and block all roads leading to other cities! Excuse me. Sorry, we are in the middle of training. Hey! Do-man! Your cap's robbered. See you later. Hey! You better step on it! I'm going to report you! I let you sly by this time, buddy. But why is he going that way? When this is over, you're gonna get yourself in big trouble I've got used to it anyway. I don't have any friends, either. But you did a real good job. You haven't been caught. You fled the scene. Hey, you did an excellent job! You know, it's weird... I did my best when I was a cop. But I was always looked over and ignored. Nothing worked out for me. Uh, we need to go that way for Sam-po harbor. Do we really need to go? We're cops. Now get to it, man. Wow, now this seems real! Hey, do you have a gun? I'm only a guest! Woah... Jung Do-man, it's over. Surrender! Hostage card again, huh? Well, it's over. A successful robber takes money and flees safely without getting caught. You think you can still win here? It was never my goal to win. I was only interested in doing my job. I robbed a bank under your jurisdiction. It didn't go as well as I had planned. Killed eight. Raped one. And I haven't yielded yet. I have a gun. Under this circumstance, there aren't many choices for a robber in this case There's no hope for me now. Bang! Bang! Is the training over? What are you going to do now? Give us a word. I did well, didn't I? You were really believable. Well, I did see 8 die today. - Close your eyes. - Oh. Chief. What's this? Officer Jung came by the first thing in the morning and left it for you. He said he couldn't take care of it since he's a traffic cop. This afternoon, former governor, Jang Choon-sup was convicted of taking bribes. Since 2004, and up to December of this year, he has accepted up to 20 million won from a certain company. and allowed a green belt zone to be developed into a golf course. Greetings, sir! Don't you have school? What are you doing here at this hour? Criminals always return to their place of crime. Oh... You don't have your uniform on today. I got my old position back. I work for the crime investigation department now. But you looked good in your uniform. Why are you paying with your money? This was the manager's car anyway. Freeze! No one move! - Don't move! - Sit still. Go over there. Put your hands up! Now! - Lower your head. - Are you deaf? You all want to die? - Everyone on their knees! - Bend down, now! What's wrong with these people? What the heck... Bend down! - Put your hands up! - Bend down!
