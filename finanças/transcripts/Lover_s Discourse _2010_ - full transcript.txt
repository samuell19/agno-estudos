People say, in order to understand a subject, one should always start with its name… This Chinese hieroglyph means vicissitude and unpredictability. The ancients combine it with the character "heart" to tell us that love is an exceptional, unpredictable state of mind. Some scientists consider what we call love is nothing but neurological reactions and sensual experiences. When we are in love, our brain and body release large amounts of neurotransmitters and hormones. The interaction of these neurotransmitters and hormones creates a storm of chemical reactions inside our brain, and gives us a feeling of joy and ecstasy. The neurological activities and release of chemical substances of people in love are very similar to those using psychoactive drugs such as cocaine and opiates. We can now understand why heartbroken people develop symptoms similar to drug addicts in withdrawal. But science only explains a part of the picture. Because it takes more than a physical reaction for two people to come together. Personality, habits, hobbies, age, family and cultural background, etc. These and numerous other innate and acquired factors are all very important in love. Love is more like an improvised performance. Everyone is unique and it cannot be repeated. The only way to understand love is to read each and every love story, and learn two or three things about it. Hello, where are you? Hello, I'm now outside of Sogo. Sogo? I'm right at the entrance. Me too! Where are you? I'm not facing the road. Not facing the road? Where are you? -At the entrance of Sogo. -Wait… hold on. Hello? I can't hear you. Hello? -Hey! -Hey! "Not facing the road"? Either side, you're facing the road. This side is for pedestrians only and that side is the road. Where do you want to go? Let's just get out of here. So crowded here. Okay. You want to get something to eat? I just had a bite at the office, I'm not hungry. -I can eat with you though. -I'm not hungry either. -Let's have a drink then. -Okay! -Where to? -You decide. How about that place from last time? It's cozy. All right. We have to go back that way then. Wait, I want to get something at the pet shop. -Where is it? -Down the road to the left. Which way? Down the road and turn left? This way! -So… -So… How are you? I'm fine, and you? I'm so busy, it's been crazy for the whole month. Busy? Doing what? Right, you didn't know. I got a new job. -What is it? -Doing window display for Adidas. -How long has it been? -Two, three months. What exactly do you do? Is there a lot of work? Loads. They keep changing the display, and right now it's the new season. That's great. You said your previous job was boring, that it was a waste of your time. And now I don't have any time for myself. That's not true. You're free now, aren't you? Are you that busy? I'm wasting your time asking you out? No. Wasting time is my favorite activity. Where is it? It seems… I think it's over there. Yes, it's right here. -Let me get you a new one. -Thanks. You still haven't decided? Think about… Close your eyes first. Tell me, then I'll close my eyes. Why… -Just close your eyes. -Okay… Is it a game? Okay? -Okay… -Yes! So, where is your hidden spot? What hidden spot? A spot that can't be easily touched by others. Under my balls. What? How about your earlobe? Okay, whatever. Earlobe it is. Now close you eyes. Okay, and think… Okay. Concentrate, and think of… a happy moment in your life. Remember, don't stop until I tell you to. Hello… Now bring that sense of well being to the surface. Stop! -It hurts! Is this a prank or what? -No! It won't work if I don't apply pressure. Or else you won't recall that moment. What is it really? I just made an emotional anchor on your earlobe. Whenever you're down, find a quiet place, pinch your earlobe, and pronto, you'll be happy! It's true. -It's true. Yes! -Really? That's what they taught in class. Why would your boyfriend attend such a class? His company made him, something about building confidence for the staff. I didn't know what he was talking about. I thought he had joined a cult. Then he asked me to try some exercise with him. Turns out to be quite fun. What does your boyfriend do? He works for an IPO company, stuff like prospectus… Really boring. How are things between you and your girlfriend? Same old… What's that look? Same old… Well, it's not very good and it's not so bad. Nothing special, more or less the same. You've been together for a long time, right? Almost four years. Are you going to marry her? No kidding, I can't even take care of myself. Never talked about it? Sort of brushed over the subject. What's up? You too? I won't marry him. Really? More like he doesn't want you. First of all, I'm not marrying a guy who snores. No way! You'll miss it when it's gone. -What else? -What do you mean? You said "first of all," so there must be another reason. Did I say "first of all"? Need to go home? No, it's from the office. I'm going to the washroom. No. Just try. Just like… But not like this. Normally, it's like this. Then slowly… Okay? It's weird! Relax, it will work. -Sure? -Sure. I can do it backwards. No, every part of my body tells me that this is not right. It's weird! Yes. It's kind of hard. How about walking while doing a back arch? Come on! That is really hard. -You are still the same. -What do you mean "the same"? Same idiot. You are pretty much the same as well. I really miss those barbecues. You remember them? Right, you can't find those type of barbeque oysters in Hong Kong. -And spicy sausage. -Spicy sausage, yes. I had them again when I went there for work last month. I'm so jealous! But I didn't eat much. I was on my own. What about Terry and the other guys? Terry. The lazy bastard wouldn't even walk. Did you stay at that so-called 4-star hotel? I sure did. That's not that far of a walk. Right. Yes. It didn't feel far when a crazy drunken woman chased you down. It's your fault. You were supposed to keep a look out for me. I did. You… Cheng Chilui. You kept saying, "Someone's coming, someone's coming." I didn't know if I should hold it or let go. It was torture! Yes. How do girls do it? Holding it… I really can't do it. Is it any easier for guys? Hey! I remember… Bastard! Hey. Don't run. Hey, it hurts. -It hurts. Stop it! -Say sorry! Stop it… Sorry! Okay. Someone is coming! Hey, don't run! Someone is coming. Hey, don't run. Wait. It feels great! I'll race you. Hey, don't pull on me. Come on, try to catch up. So painful. Hey… no! Are you trying to kill me? Come on! It really hurts. It'll be all right. What is it? I miss you so much. Me too. After I saw you last time, I was afraid to call you again. I felt it too. That's why I never called you even though I really missed you. We are a bit pathetic, don't you think? We miss each other so much because we are not together. But if we stay together one day, we may end up just like everyone else. We'll do fine at the beginning, then we'd feel bored, and then in the most mundane way, we'd break up. But it's also possible that we're different. Okay. I'll be waiting for you. No. I'll be waiting for you. Sorry. You are here? All right. I'm coming. Okay, bye. You're leaving? Yes. Let's go. I have to go. I'll call you. Bye. Excuse me. Last name? Lai. Phone number? 92106224. $59. Thanks. Excuse me, the last time I brought my clothes here, did you notice a name tag? What name tag? No… It's all right, thank you. DR K. S. LAI Mr. Wong, open your mouth, please. We are ready, Dr. Lai. How are you, Mr. Wong? How are you? Open your mouth. Wider, please. Right, okay. Let me check your teeth. Good, very good. There's a cavity here. It's okay, we'll take care of it. It's okay. What is it? -Did you change your cologne? -Can you smell it? I like the previous one better. This one's too strong, it doesn't suit you. Really? Spray, please. Okay! Why did you change your cologne? It's a gift from a friend. I just wanted to try it. Friend? -Girlfriend? -I don't have a girlfriend. Really? Doing your laundry, Mr. Lai? Yes. Thank you. Mr. Lai, your phone number? 9210… …6224. -It'll be ready tomorrow. -Thank you. How much? $58. Thank you. Thank you. Shouldn't have played stupid video games. Yes! Must've been fun. THEATRE Taoist vs. Vampire at 9:30 for one. Row F seat 22, please. The way of Tao! Are you okay? I am fine. Be careful! Are you okay? I am fine. Thank you for saving me. Aren't you the girl from the laundry? So it's really you. I thought you wouldn't recognize me. Besides you, who would risk her life to save me? I… I'm just doing what I think is right. I can finally confirm your feelings for me. Mr. Lai, please don't take it the wrong way. I just don't want to lose a good customer. Why are you still denying it? How are you doing? Don't you remember that time I came to your shop with a black and white striped polo shirt that had grease stains on it? I asked if they could be removed and you said yes. Later on, I picked up the shirt and the stains were gone. But I knew you didn't wash it. Instead you bought me a new one. I just knew it. So how dare you say you are not in love with me? Look into my eyes. I… Can I hold you? That would be great. What? Are you closing? Yes, we close at 8:00 p.m. We close at 8:00 p.m. every day. Right. I'm sorry. You want to do your laundry? Yes. Give it to me. Really? Should I pay you now? -How much is it? -It's okay. Pay me when you pick it up. Mr. Lai, right? Thank you so much. Thank you. Excuse me. Got some laundry for us, Mr. Lai? Yes, thank you. It's lighter. Nothing. Phone number? 9210… 6… 224. How much? $42. -Thank you. -You're Welcome. Miss. Excuse me. What is your name? What is it? All this time, I still don't know your name. I am Gi, everyone calls me Gi. Gi… Thank you for doing the laundry for me. I am moving in two days, my friend will pick up the clothes for me. Just tell him to bring the receipt. Cool, thanks. You're welcome. Bye. Bye. Excuse me, I want to get that coin purse. Master, Miss Gi is behind us. Stop. Look at you, you're sweating. I brought you the clothes. Thanks. Well, I got you a present. It's in the bag. Really? What is it? Don't look now. Wait until you get into the car. Why spend the money? -It's your money anyways. -What? Nothing. I don't know when I will be back. Take good care of yourself. I'll miss you. Me too. By the way, where would you do your laundry then? I think… I'll get a washer. You know, not every laundry is as good as yours. There're no special tricks to washing clothes. Just remember to separate the colors. And don't use hot water unless it's necessary. Otherwise your clothes will shrink and colors will fade. It's all explained on the tags. You just have to read them. I got it. Master, we need to go now. Okay. I really have to go now, no need to see me off. Take good care of yourself. You too. Bye, Gi! You are the best! You know? Bye! -Excuse me. -Yes. Could you tell me your rates? $30 for the first one to seven pounds, after that $4 for each extra pound. And this is the price list for dry-cleaning. Hello? Yes! Where are you? I'm by the glassware. Okay! Sure! What do you want? Where? Okay, just tell me where exactly you are. No, I don't see you. Okay, I will go that way! TWELVE YEARS AGO Here! Get him! -Get him! -Get him! Get him! Come on now! Don't pussy out on me! -Get him! -Hey! Shit! Don't move! Where? It's on the ground! My ultimate warrior! Don't step on it. All right. I'll ask him. All right. That's it. It's Manchester United against Arsenal tonight. My dad asked if you want to come over. Sure. What the hell's wrong with Arsenal today? Dad is pissed. You bet a lot on them? -It's just Bergkamp… -If he plays smarter, they won't be bad! Vieira on the bench, what's wrong with Wenger? I can do better than him! Right? What? You don't believe it? Who scored that goal last week? -Yes, you were great. -Of course. It's okay, just give it to me. You have to check the focus for every shot. The silver ring at the back is the aperture. You have to adjust the aperture under different lighting. How far away can I shoot? This is a 200 mm lens. You'd be able to see the green roof over there clearly. Try it. Excuse me. -By the hour or by the day? -Hour. But I'd like room nine. Look at all these dishes. Hey, Dad. Get up. Dinner is ready. Let's eat. Po, you are here, is there a game? No. We are going out with B. -Come home early. -Okay. Let's eat. Great dishes. Let's have the soup first. Uncle, I saw you in Tai Po today. Did you? Tai Po? What for? I went to visit my god-brother at his salon. I haven't been there for a while. I'll go with you next time. Okay. I'm going to sleep. I have an early day tomorrow. Good night. -Good morning, boss. -Morning, Mrs. Lai. -The usual. -Okay. Okay. Thanks! I'm here to get my photos. Damn! Too much power! Mom. You can't beat him. He's too fast. You just won't get away. Let me show you my long shots! Come on, let's have some goal action! I'm destroying you, it's boring! Here I come again. Hey, kick off. Hello? Heem's Records. Hello? Yes. I got it. I got it. Three o'clock. Bye. -What would you like, miss? -Nothing, thanks. Does Sang know about this? What do you want? I think this is something you should know. -My family affairs are not your business. -I don't want you to be cheated. I could be your mom! What the hell do you want? I want you to leave him. Are you out of your mind? Do you know what you are talking about? -Are you happy with him? -That's none of your business! It's none of my business, but if I didn't tell you, he'll still be cheating you. You think I didn't know? Then why are you still with him? Where did you take those pictures? I rented a room across from their building. Are there any others? Yes. Where? In my room. Let's go get them. You bastard! I don't want my son to know about this. Take your time. I have to go. You haven't found your mom, have you? I'm leaving. Bye. Hello? Yes, where are you? I am right by the glassware. Where are you? Sorry… Hey! There you are. -Something's wrong? -No. Okay. Let's go. -Would you like to order something, miss? -No, thanks. So? Didn't you say you have something to ask me? Does your girlfriend have these shoes? I'm not sure. You asked me to come out for this? How long have you been with your girlfriend? Over a year. How do you know my girlfriend is seeing your boyfriend? I saw a picture of my boyfriend on the net. It's taken at a party where I didn't know anyone. He's being very intimate with your girlfriend… So I clicked into your girlfriend's homepage, and found that they had an intimate conversation… About four months ago. And then they stopped. I found that picture two weeks ago, and it was deleted the next day. I don't think they're just friends. Have your noticed your girlfriend acting different lately? What about the picture in your phone? That… was taken on my boyfriend's phone. I wanted to know if it's her… These pictures don't prove anything. Your boyfriend deleted those pictures because he didn't want you to know that he's flirting with other women, and it doesn't mean that my girlfriend's seeing him. All right. Even if it's true that they are really seeing each other, what are you going to do? You should be confronting them instead of coming to me. I'm sorry, I don't think there's anything I can do for you. -Hi. -Hello. Why are you here? I just had a drink with Tim nearby. Where's Tim? He left already. And you? Waiting for you. Dinner? Sure, but I have to finish up. -I'll call you later. -All right. Okay, bye. You're back? Didn't you say you'll be late at work? What? Didn't you say you'll be late at work? What did you say? Forget it. No more noodles? How should I know? I'm going out to eat. Give me a second. I'm getting changed. U STILL DON'T BELIEVE? Hello. Hello. Hello? Yes. Where are you? I am right by the glassware. Where are you? Where? Okay. Just tell me where exactly you are. I'm sorry! Hello? Your boyfriend's gone. What? I lost him. Where are you? I'm on a tram. Going where? Near Victoria Park, I'm getting off. She's heading home. I think so. Are you okay? I'm fine. Why don't you head over first? Okay. Bye. Sorry. Are you all right? No… Are you all right? I'm sorry. Do you hate me? Why would I hate you? If I hadn't told you, you'd still be in the dark, and you wouldn't be upset like now. It was just a matter of time. I'd rather find out earlier. What are you going to do? What can I do? After all this, you're still going to be with her? I don't know. What about you? What are you going to do? I don't know. I just don't want them to be so happy. I've realized… that I don't have the courage to leave him. I'm tired. I feel so tired. I don't want to spend any more time to get used to another person, to accept his good and his bad. And then… to get hurt again. It just keeps on repeating. In the end, you realize that you never knew who truly loved you. Can you pretend that nothing has happened and stay with him? That'll be too easy on him. I can't let him off so easily. Let's go to your place.
