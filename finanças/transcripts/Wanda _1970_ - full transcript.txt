I'll be back in a couple of hours. See ya! Tony! Hello, Wanda. I'm coming! Picking coal again? Yes, picking coal again, Wanda. There ain't much left. Could you loan me a little bit of money? Well I don't have too much money. - Well that's okay. - But if I had more, I would give you more. I just need a little bit. Here it is, Wanda. I hope that you'll get some more money out of somebody else. That's the best that I can do. Gonna pick some coal today? Yes, I pick a little coal. I ain't gonna do much now, all I'm going to do is just pick this one more pail. And then I'm going to take it easy for the day. This afternoon I will go fishing for a few hours. And that will take up my time and I will enjoy myself for a while. Wanda Goronski. Do you know where she is? I dunno, she wouldn't even care enough to come to court. Well go look in the hall. Are those your children, over there? Those are my kids. And who is that young lady? That's Miss Godek. She's been helping to take care of the kids. We kinda wanna get married, cause the kids need a mother. She isn't in the hallway. Christ, that's just like her. She don't care about anything. She's a lousy wife, she's always bumming around, drinking. Never took care of us, never took care of the kids. I used to get up for work, make my own breakfast, change the kids. Come home from work, she's lying around on the couch. Kids are dirty, there's diapers on the floor. Sometimes the kids is outside, running around, nobody watching them. Wanda Goronski? Step up here, please. No smoking. Mrs. Goronski, your husband told me you deserted him and the children. What do you have to say? Nothing. Did you desert them? Listen, judge, if he wants a divorce, just give it to him. Now Mrs. Goronski, you have two young children here. They'd be o... better off with him. - What? - They'd be better off with him. You have no objections to this divorce? No, I don't have any objection to it. Milt, there's someone here to see you. Hey, if you think I can make this lot next week, you're crazy.

And that's all I get? Sorry, that's the score. Um, you said that you might be taking on some more... Some more people this week. Do you think you might be able to use me? Well, we are taking on more people. But you're just too slow in our operations. And we can't use you. Well I could learn... I could... I'm sorry, my dear. That's just the best I can do for you.

"He was just a customer..." "sitting at the bar..." "he waited" "til everybody left." "Although the robber came in alone," "he left..." "according..." "to Mr. Malucchi..." "with a female whom he wasn't able to see..." "because he was lying behind the bar." Go ahead! That's all. Hey, what are you trying to get me into? Get out! I didn't do anything. Read it again. "Police are on the lookout for the couple." That's all it says. Says police are on the lookout for the couple. Go back to your comics. You don't have to do anything... just drive. I'm waiting for my kid to come home. The little bit that I got, I don't wanna lose. If I go with you, maybe... one out of a hundred, we get away. I'm not taking that chance now. - Sure? - That's it.

Now as we go down we will see nidges in the walls. These nidges in the walls are the places where they buried their dead. If you see one that's flat on top that shows a good christian that died and was buried in the catacombs. But if you see one that has a [...] over it, sort of a hat... then that's a place where a martyr was buried. And of course we all know that a martyr is a person who was killed for his or her faith. Here on the side we have Saint Thecla who was a disciple of Saint Paul. - Are you looking for a job? - Yeah... Yeah, pop. Did you find one... Find a job? Not yet, pop. Good boy...

Memorize it, huh? One: Get to the house. Two: gain entrance. Mr. Dennis, I can't do this. Ah, come on! No, Mr. Dennis. I really mean it. I can't do it. What do you mean, you can't do it?

Number one: gain entrance... Wait a minute! Number one: get to the house. Oh yeah. Number one: get to the house. - Number two: get entrance. Right? - Right. Hey, what if they won't let us in? Look, would you stop raising problems. Just get the plan, come on. Number three? Number three... Hey, are you alright? What's the matter? Are you sick or something? No, I'm alright. So I guess it's time to go, isn't it? - Yeah. - I guess we better go then. Oh for Christ's sake! What the hell is wrong with you?! I'm alright, Mr. Dennis, I really am... I'm alright now.

Come on. Watch it. Good morning, Jim, how are you... Would you step back with me, please. And you folks, come down here. I'd like to speak with you for a minute.

Bartender, can we have a couple of fresh beers here? ... at this point, the bomb was inoperable. We then turned around to examine what appeared to be dynamite. And on dismantling the dynamite, it appears that this was strictly a dummy bomb, used to scare these people. This bomb, to the ordinary person... Honey, you waiting for somebody?
