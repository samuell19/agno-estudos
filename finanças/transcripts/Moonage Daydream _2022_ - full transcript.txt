Time. One of the most complex expressions. Memory made manifest. It's something that straddles past and future without ever quite being present. Or rather, it at first seems indifferent to the present. There's a tension of a most unfathomable nature. The word desires to be understood. To have meaning. But you somehow feel that it's not you yourself that the word is addressing. It washes over you, holding a dialogue with something arcane that's maybe not mortal. And you feel intrigued. Captured even. You're aware of a deeper existence. Maybe a temporary reassurance that indeed there is no beginning, no end. And all at once, the outward appearance of meaning is transcended. And you find yourself struggling to comprehend a deep and formidable mystery. All is transient. Does it matter?

What, with reflection? Yeah, that it is really a reflection of what they're like. Mr. Powell, Mr. Jenkins. Businessmen in general... Best watch it. How are you? I'm very well, thank you. How are you? INTERVIEWER I'm fine. Good. How are you? How are you? You, uh, have to get the gear on in order to project yourself. I mean, were you a nobody who suddenly thought, "Jesus, I must get into the scene by some other way"? I never asked Jesus for a think, no. It was always on my own initiative. And... When I was 14, I became a Mod, and it just carried on from there. I've always dressed in what I considered clothes that are exciting for me, um, to prevent me becoming humdrum so that I would receive reaction from people which would encourage me to write. You will have obviously as many men followers - as you have women followers. - Yes. I mean, you haven't been shy about declaring a certain air of bisexuality. Not at all. I know quite a few men. Some people feel you're... By saying you're bisexual. By... by kind of flaunting that in a way... Who's flaunting it? Why do you think that bisexuality in, say '72, '73 has become a common... not a common, but an accepted kind of deal. Why do you think we have moved into that era of liberal behavior? Once upon a time, your father, my father, everybody's father, I presume, wanted a good job, with a good income, or reasonable income. Some chance of promotion to secure their family life. Um, where's the camera? You're probably fine there, and that's where it ended. But now, people want a role in society. They want to feel that they have a position. They want to be an individual, and I think there's a lot of searching to find the individual within oneself. Right, and how about the shoes? Are those men's shoes, or women's shoes, or bisexual shoes? They're shoe shoes, silly. There was a feeling of excitement and titillation about moving in areas which were forbidden to the rest of society. From micro to macro, from yin to yang, from male to female, there is no scissor cut. No absolute. I believe that there was an unconscious move to create a high priest form from the line of the Greek gods who could procreate themselves. Somebody who was at a super level to we regular mortals, because of his androgynous nature, being somebody that incorporated both feminine and masculine attributes. ♪ I'm an alligator ♪ ♪ I'm a mama-papa comin' for you ♪ ♪ I'm the space invader ♪ ♪ I'll be a rock 'n' rollin' bitch for you ♪ ♪ Keep your mouth shut ♪ ♪ You're squawking like a pink monkey bird ♪ ♪ And I'm bustin' up my brains for the words ♪ Know I am. ♪ Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe ♪ ♪ Put your ray gun to my head ♪ ♪ Press your space face close to mine, love ♪ ♪ Freak out in a moon age daydream, oh yeah! ♪ ♪ Don't fake it baby ♪ ♪ Lay the real thing on me ♪ ♪ You know, the church of man, love ♪ ♪ Is such a holy place to be ♪ ♪ Don't fake it, baby ♪ ♪ Make me know you really care ♪ ♪ Make me jump into the air ♪ ♪ If you dare ♪ ♪ Keep your 'lectric eye on me, babe ♪ ♪ Put your ray gun to my head ♪ ♪ Press your space face close to mine, love ♪ ♪ Freak out in a moon age daydream, oh yeah! ♪ It was a pudding, you know?

Do the clothes, you are trying to say, are the clothes expressed now your own personality? Um, no, that I've never been quite clear about. I've never been sure of my own personality. That's very refreshing. That's a very refreshing thing to hear somebody say that. Very. But can you fill us in on the barest outlines? I'm a collector. Um, and I've always just seemed to collect personalities, um, ideas. I have a hodge podge philosophy - which really is very minimal. - Um, what? Do you believe in God? Um, I believe in an energy form. I'm not... I wouldn't put a I wouldn't like to put a name to it. Do you indulge in any form of worship? Um, uh, life. I love life very much indeed. My strivings to have some kind of spiritual base were really, really strong all my life, and I think I tried to amalgamate my own bedrock of spirituality. I mean, I was a Buddhist on Tuesday, and I was into Nietzsche by Friday. Some time flirting with Buddhism, and spending some time in a Buddhist retreat. I mean, I felt at the time that I was, you know, um, Buddha's answer to everything he wanted man to be, but I'm... the one thing that hung over from that time was the feeling of impermanence and transience. That was the one thing that really struck home about everything that I was learning. Nothing's gonna stay around very long. I mean, you know, everything changes different rates. Some seem to me sort of established for a bit, but they're only moving at a slower rate than other things and they're all inevitably sort of a change-over. For me, there's always been a thread of merely, um, a search. Generally, I think the subject matters always come back to this singular question of nearly every artist, which is what's my relationship with the universe? Whatever other form it takes that's basic, I think that's probably the essential question that all of us ask ourselves. A lot of us probably on that last few minutes. What's Ziggy? Ziggy, I wanted... I wanted to define the archetype "Messiah Rock star." That's all I wanted to do, and I used the trappings of Kabuki theater, mime technique, and fringe New York music. ♪ Love, love me do ♪ ♪ You know I love you ♪ ♪ I'll always be true ♪ ♪ So please ♪ ♪ Love me do ♪ ♪ Loves to be loved ♪ Ziggy was for me a very simplistic thing: What it seemed to be, an alien rock star, but other people reread him and contributed more information about Ziggy than I'd put into him. You know, we've set ourselves up as such. We want it all. You know, we want all the adulation, and people to read the lyrics, and read and everything just to play the game. When I was really young, one of the mysteries, the great mystery of rock, was that I hardly understood a word of what they were singing about. Fats Domino, I still don't know one word of one lyric that he ever wrote. I never understood his pronunciation. And that made it even more mysterious, and wonderful, and magic, you know? That he was talking about something that I couldn't even possibly start to understand, and I wanted in. I wanted to be in that place, this alternate universe, you know? And that was so much a part of the magic of music, and the same with art. I never really... I could appreciate the Vermeer, or Tintoretto, or Titian, or something like that, but because it was symbolic and figurative, it didn't... I was never that impressed with virtuosity. I was, you know, I understood that their technique and the way they applied paint, and what they could do, and how they could embrace light and all that, I understood and realized the, and I bowed in humbleness at their... But it wasn't... I mean, that's not what I wanted from it. I wanted to use art. I wanted to use art in a different way in my life. I wanted a sense that all the nooks and crannies that we don't understand about the way that we live through our day to day life, and I wanted that shown to me, you know? Not in great clarity, but some kind of physical manifestation of these are the areas of life that are causing you grief, or euphoria, and you don't really know why. Why is it that you wake up one day, and an oak tree, hit by the light in a certain way, will produce these extraordinary feelings of glee, and absolute enjoyment, exhilaration at actually being alive. Another day, you can wake up and that same tree will seem like some. Caspar David Fried rich symbolic death, you know? And it will be dark and negative and awful, you know? And it's that sense of why those things happen? Why aren't things the same every single day and produce exactly the same feeling? And art always does that to me. What are your hobbies? Well, where would you like to start? Uh, I sculpt, paint, and write films. Um, I make video television. Not programs, but video television. - Of what? - Um, art things that I do. Experimental video, and cinematography. With the art now that you create, the sculpturings... Yeah, I have... you'll see. Is what I play with video, yes. I flirt an awful lot. I've asked again, over the last few years, I've been identifying again with a force. I don't know how I'm going to... How it will end up for me, but, um, I can't pinpoint it, but I do have a very strong belief in in a force, and I don't know how it works. What I mean is, there is something else other than us. That's as near as I can get to it, and it may even just be people on other planets that I'm thinking about. It may be God. It may be... I don't know what it is, but there's a definite force that I feel. Almost like there's something else, - that we're just a part of it. - Yeah. Yeah. That's beyond us. That's my feeling as well. There's always been, um, for me I guess for a lot of people... A certain sense of you that's other-worldly.

Hey, hey, good evening, Buffalo. It's nice to be here. He was living between our family and another family, and the periods that I did see him, it seemed to me that he had more curiosity about the world than anybody I'd met. And the first real, major event for me was when he passed Jack Kerouac's On The Road on to me, which really changed my life. And he would also introduce me to people like John Coltrane, which was way above my head, but I wanted to read what he read, and I wanted to listen to what he listened to, as one does with an older brother. ♪ When you rock 'n' roll with me ♪ ♪ No one else I'd rather be ♪ ♪ Nobody here can do it for me... ♪ I think Terry probably gave me a great...

Is that true? Um, no, I developed a system against it. I think that probably became part of the therapy of art, and I was fortunate enough to be able to express any visions that I had in my head. - Yeah. - Very outwardly. Gradually learning to do without sleep. It's a labyrinthine existence that we live, and so it makes sense for me to put together elements in a song which wouldn't naturally be good bedfellows. I guess I'm trying to articulate those mysterious corners of the mind where there exist grains of truth that we don't often touch on, because we don't have the words to capture them. So, we'll write on three or four different subject matters, and then integrate them together by cutting them up. What I've used it for more than anything else is igniting anything that might be in my imagination. I've tried doing it with diaries and things, and I was finding out amazing things about me and what I'd done and where I was going. A lot of the things I had done, it seemed that it would predict things about the future and tell me a lot about the past. I suppose it's a very Western tarot. I don't know. Obviously, one is trying to always reevaluate one's personality, and understand why one works. I think a lot of artists deal with loneliness and solitude. An artist does tend to examine the world through his relationship to it, and so that produces a very introverted looking lot of work. I don't feel lonely. I apply that to my work. I sense a feeling of loneliness from my work when I look at it, but I don't feel like a solitary person myself, but it seems to show up in my work, and it's like taking a photograph and then developing the negative and seeing another person standing behind you. ♪ Who will love Aladdin Sane ♪ ♪ Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise ♪ ♪ Who will love Aladdin Sane ♪ ♪ Motor sensational ♪ ♪ Paris or maybe hell ♪ ♪ I'm waiting ♪ ♪ Clutches of sad remains ♪ ♪ Waits for Aladdin Sane You'll make it ♪ ♪ Who will love Aladdin Sane ♪ ♪ Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise... ♪ With your background, why were you intrigued by all this?

I mean, if there's nothing to keep it going. It just supplied a need in me. American became a myth-land for me. We're not stopped. Is there anything behind us? Let's go with him now live, by satellite, to beautiful downtown Burbank in Los Angeles. Is it true that you're gonna be teaming up with... Every avenue. It's very calm, and it's a kind of a superficial calmness that they've developed to underplay the fact that it's... There's a lot of high pressure here, as it's a very big entertainment industry area. And you get this feeling of unease with everybody. It's a very big entertainment area. The first time that it really came home to me what a strange... About the churches designed by an architect. Arthur, would you please slow down? We're bouncing backwards and forwards on the satellite at the moment. I mean, our sound is bouncing around. Yes, I can see it. It'll be all right in a minute. Are you there, David? Are you there, David? Bedroom in the sky. Are you there, Mr. David Bowie? I think that I felt often, ever since I was a teenager, um, so adrift, and so not part of everyone I saw. There's so many dark secrets about my family in the cupboard that it kind of made me feel very much on the outside of everything, and because of that, I felt there was no basis to my life, like everybody else seemed to have. Which of course is ridiculous. Probably, I would do things to prove that I had some emotional substance when in fact I didn't. Thematically, I've always dealt with isolation in everything I've written, I think. If you're interested in isolation, is it because you think that a person in an isolated state feel greater emotions than they do when they're surrounded by people and things? I think if he is in isolation, instead of receiving the whole world as his home, he tends to create a micro-world inside himself. Um, and it's that peculiar part of the human mind that fascinates me about the small universes that can be created inside the mind. Some of them fairly schizophrenic and quite off the wall. It feels now that I don't come from anywhere, but I was born in Brixton. When were you born? What year? 1947. January the eighth. Makes me a Capricorn with an Aquarius ascendant and a Leo descendant. How much now is left of the lad from Brixton, do you think? Not very much, I would think. I know, you know. I never got... I never became who I should have been. I've spent an awful lot of my life actually looking for myself, you know? And understanding what it was that I-why-what I existed for. What was it that really made me happy in life? And who exactly, or was... Who are the parts of myself I was trying to hide from? I think a lot of us have huge senses of denial about who we are and where we exist in the world. I really wanted to sort of, you know, be very emotionally involved with people. I didn't know how to do it. You know, my parents were like that, and I guess you kind of, as they say, they pass on a lot of faults. What do your parents do for a living? My father's dead, and my mother has a small flat, and I think she's got a day job. Does she have trouble explaining you to the neighbors who say, "Are you any relation to that". I think she pretends I'm not hers. Nah, she's uh, she doesn't talk much. You know, she doesn't, um, I don't think we really... We were never that close particularly. We have an understanding. Yeah. Was it a happy marriage? Not necessarily terribly loving or anything, in terms of no real physical affection, or even they didn't really articulate any love for each other. There's an awful lot of emotional/spiritual mutilation goes on in my family. Did you like any of the traditional people that you're supposed to like? Like, did you like Winnie the Pooh? No. No. Rupert Bear? No. No I didn't. I didn't like... Did you have a teddy bear? No, I didn't. I don't think. I can't remember having anything like that at all. No, I never liked, um, children's things very much. You know, since you've been away, or quite recently, the newspapers having been having a bit of a bash at your mother? And saying that she's a bit tearful from time to time. And that she's suffered a certain amount of anguish, and that she doesn't hear from you an awful lot. Is that eyewash or is it real? There's some kind of traumatism often goes on in our childhoods I think. I think, that are... Makes us crave some kind of strange affection, you know? It's sort of an... Often you'll find that the person who craves a lot of affection actually isn't terribly good at giving it. Does that mean you have to separate yourself quite a lot from, say, falling in love and getting very involved with a person? Um, oh no, I think, no. I think quite the reverse. But, love, falling in love, is different from then going on to love that person. Yes, it is. Yes. And once you've loved somebody a lot, it means that you've got to share your life with them. - That's what I really... - No, I don't think so. I think you can love somebody from afar. But if you then decided not to love them from afar, you as an artist would have to give up quite a lot of your time to them. Yes, and I can't do that. That's what I was wondering, whether you did... Whether you did that. No, no, no, love can't get quite in my way, because I feel... I shelter myself from it incredibly. Do you feel removed from the body and the feel that you create on the planet?

I got to a point in Los Angeles where I got very tired with my method of writing, and I wanted to invent a new musical language. I knew I had to get to an environment that was totally different to Los Angeles. So I thought of the most arduous city that I could think of, and it was West Berlin. They don't give an FA about who you are in Berlin. The trappings of rock and roll don't mean anything to them. So, I could walk around, buy me own food, and just lease a small apartment, which I did above an automobile spare parts shop. I didn't have the necessary verbal equipment to describe what I was seeing, and that's where I needed assistance. So, I contacted Brian Eno, who is definitely one of the keenest brains of modern music, and I said, "Look, Brian, I need to know some new processes, "and new methods of writing. Please help me, otherwise I'm packing it in." We started working on a series of processes and methods of writing in the studio in Berlin to invent, a different kind of linguistics to work with. Most of the things that I do these days, I go in with very little preparation. There's no governor, no controller. Every track is written with a different process, from spontaneous singing, I didn't know what I was gonna sing, or how I was gonna sing it, and I just stood in front of the mic, right down to fragmented, pre-thought, analyzed and processed writings of Burroughs' school. It probably touches areas of emotion that aren't normally dwelt upon because they're arrived at other than by the regular channels of emotive thought. ♪ Blue, blue, electric blue ♪ ♪ That's the color of my living room ♪ ♪ Where I will live ♪ ♪ Blue, blue ♪ ♪ Pale blinds drawn all day ♪ ♪ Nothing to read and nothing to say ♪ ♪ Blue, blue Pale blinds ♪ ♪ I will dream of other lands ♪ ♪ Waiting for the gift of sound and vision ♪ Most of the things that I do these days are on the occasion of the studio. I go in with very little preparation, just throw ideas out, and you might make little experiments sort of say, look here's 50 seconds. Play 10 notes on that 50 seconds and don't repeat the same note twice. Now, that sounds like an awful easy thing to do. Well, it is. See, you must understand, I mean, it sounds incredibly indulgent, and indeed it is because what I'm trying to do is mold the traditional methods of rock and roll with newer processes. Trying to find a new form of language. Do you think you have influence on their thinking, though? No. And that's what I'm trying to do with the new music, is find a new language which doesn't... it isn't that... Doesn't have that kind of image influence. Do you think people will understand that language? Yes. Because I think people, especially in the city context, think in fragments. The city person will see a milk advert on the street, and be thinking "Milk, what's gonna... "What are we gonna have for dinner? "Boy getting knocked down by a bus, crashed against a wall..." that kind of thing. So, he's thinking in terms of, maybe 1,000 different images at any given time. And the language that Brian and I are sort of producing is a language that can relate to that way of thinking. We live within this manifested idea of what should be form, and what we try and keep out of our existence is chaos, which is a very real part of our lives, and our refusal to accept chaos as being integral to our existence, I think, has been one of the greatest mistakes as a civilization that we've made. My work as an artist has always been to do with transition. The nature and study of change in our particular era is most important because never in our history has there been such a rapid curve of change since the industrial revolution. I'm a fairly good social observer, and I think that I encapsulate areas every, maybe every year or so, I tried to stamp that down somewhere, what that year is all about. Rather than what it was all about, or what it's going to be. It's very much trying to capture the quintessence of that year. I notice that the music now is more... more daring, more adventurous, more fractured. Is there a danger that by following your instinct, your aesthetic instincts, if you like, your artistic instinct, that you will jeopardize that? You know, the money and the good life and all... No shit, Sherlock. Yes, I think I... Yes, I think I rather sort of hit that one in the head at the moment. Um, and it's quite a relief, really. I feel a lot more, um, free than what I do. I just needed, it just needed a positive decision to only do what I want to do, and not do things for the sake of what either David Bowie or whoever I was playing last time, Thin White Duke or something, was expected to do. I went naked in Berlin. I really did try and strip down my life to what I believed to be absolute basic essentials so I could build up again everything that I thought that I'd lost, you know? I guess I was... What I was really doing was doing that on an emotional and spiritual level, but you manifest it physically. The surprising thing is, is that we came up... We thought we were just going to be into a process of discovery and experiment and had some pretty wishy-washy stuff come out of it, but what did come out of it was a pretty good statement of some esoteric nature. It was a bit hard to put one's finger on exactly what the information was, but it was vital, and it was interesting, and I think that's successful music. ♪ I, I will be king ♪ ♪ And you, you will be my queen ♪ ♪ Though nothing can keep us together ♪ ♪ We can beat them, forever and ever ♪ ♪ We could be heroes just for one day ♪ ♪ You, you can be me ♪ ♪ And I, I'll drink all the time ♪ ♪ 'Cause we're lovers, and that is the fact ♪ ♪ Yes we're lovers, and that is that ♪ ♪ Though nothing will keep us together ♪ ♪ We can beat them forever and ever ♪ ♪ And we can be heroes just for one day ♪ ♪ I, well I wish I could swim ♪ ♪ Like dolphins, like dolphins can swim ♪ ♪ Though nothing, can drive them away ♪ ♪ We can beat them forever and ever ♪ ♪ Oh, we can be heroes just for one day ♪ ♪ What you say? ♪ ♪ I, I can remember ♪ ♪ I remember ♪ ♪ Standing by the wall ♪ ♪ By the wall ♪ ♪ And the guns shot above our heads ♪ ♪ Over our heads ♪ ♪ And we kissed as though nothing could fall ♪ ♪ Nothing could fall ♪ ♪ And nothing and no one will help us ♪ ♪ Maybe we're lying ♪ ♪ Then you better not stay ♪ ♪ We can be safer just for one day ♪ ♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh ♪ ♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh ♪ ♪ We can be heroes ♪ ♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh ♪ ♪ Just for one day ♪ ♪ Oh-oh-oh-oh ♪ ♪ Just for one day. ♪ Today, David Bowie is 33 years old. He has recorded 17 rock albums, produced a gallery full of paintings, acted in two feature films, and is the only rock star ever to act in a play on Broadway. Bowie never seems to stand still. When he no longer feels challenged by one art form, he moves on to the next, and the next, and the next. It's as if David Bowie learned to run before he learned to walk. ♪ I'm home ♪ ♪ Lost my job... ♪ You know, I've got a grasshopper sort of mind, and I can't resist bringing things to a conclusion like saying, "Well that's a piece in itself, and now I move on to something else."

I want... I'm a generalist, is really sort of my cliche way describing myself. David Bowie. Rank and file. 33 years old. Generalist. Unlike most rock stars who stick to a successful formula when they get it, Bowie, when he does, deliberately changes direction, and puts on yet another face. ♪ Believing me ♪ I really sort of go in just pure, barbaric impetus. I do get fired up for something and it's not all cerebral at all, by any means. A lot of it is pure instinct, and knowing that I've found something that I haven't found before.

Yes. Quire large, acrylics. I'm doing a lot of sculptures as well. A sort of polythene and essential functional things. Why are you creative, David? I think it has something to do with wanting to find the place where I can kind of set sail and know that I won't really fall off the edge of the world when I get to the end of the sea. I find it an intoxicating parallel to my perceived reality. I'm not sure that I'm manifesting ideas when I do my work. It's just this inexhaustible supply of extracurricular thoughts that I have that don't actually apply to the survival of life, and I'm not quite sure what to do with them. ♪ He used to be my boss and now he is a puppet dancer ♪ ♪ I am the D.J., and I've got believers ♪ ♪ I got believers ♪ ♪ I got believers ♪ ♪ I got believers, believing me... ♪ So rather than be pinned down, my momentum was to hit and run very fast.

Again, what is "most of one's time"? Over the last year, it's been London, New York, South Pacific, Australia, Africa... The nature of my life is one of an old-fashioned beatnik traveler, and more than anything else, I spend very little time in musical circles. I spend more time discovering the social life of rather obscure places.

That is what home is. I had always thought that by this stage I would be settled down somewhere with a house and grounds and everything, but I never got to doing that. Never... I've never bought a house, and I still have no intention to buy because with me, the way I live is very much also part of the what produces my work, so I have to keep examining my life to make sure that I am in constant change, and not getting too bloated with philosophic opulence. Keep sort of throwing bits and pieces away. And by... to change countries is one way of doing that. I'm not quite sure where to go now. Um, the East beckons me. I'm a bit scared of moving over there, you know? Japan? Yes, because I fall in love so much with the lifestyle that I'll get very Zen about it. Please give us your special message to the audience of our program, "Young Oh! Oh!" Look at the camera, please. Uh, don't waste any day. Don't waste a minute. Yes. Mr. David Bowie. Thank you again. I hope that none of us are kind of static throughout our lives. I mean, I guess one has a formed personality from quite an early age, but it is tempered and subject to change. I mean, we all to a certain extent create our lives and create our culture daily, as we live that 24 hours. We'll choose a tie, or a haircut, or a chair, not just because it's functional, but for most of us because it actually says something about us. I still, you know, am sort of getting somewhere that I quite like, but I'm still not. We'll find out eventually, won't we? I might now be cut out for all this, really, at the end. Why did you change so often? I mean, what was the need for it? Was it just a gimmick? Being a Capricorn. I didn't want to expose myself to the public, so I developed a series of characters. So, behind that all the time was a real David Bowie? At times, yes. I lost control a couple of times. So you're not... This is really you. This is not you just still sort of playing the role of... One wonders. I think that it's not at all mystifying why you change your appearance as often as you do, to my view by the way, because I think you've used yourself as a canvas. - Yes, very much so. - Is that right? Yes, very much so. Um, I never wanted to appear as myself onstage ever, at any time, until recently. Were you hiding yourself from us by doing that? Partly, but I was enjoying it very much. - And, you paint now? - Yes. But your paintings, you're not willing to let us see yet? Uh, no. I've been offered two or three showings, but I've turned I've accepted two of them, and then I broke my word and said I wouldn't show them. I haven't yet bucked up the courage. Why not? What do you fear? Well, I know I'm a good writer. I'm not sure about putting my paintings. They're very personal to me, as well. Um, they're all portraits, and they're portraits of people in isolation. Most of the paintings are Germans or Turks who live in Berlin, and they're either from East Berlin, and who are now living in West Berlin, and knowing their families are on the other side of the wall. And so, I tried to capture a lot of that isolation and I put a lot of myself into the paintings as well. They're very much part of me. Well, I think the question is what... You know, what you want to be for yourself and your life. I don't know whether that's important anymore. I mean, what I want to do is just work well. When I'm working well, I like my writing. At the moment, especially. More than at any other time, I think. I mean, I was getting so bored with what I was writing. I just, I felt inadequate, I thought my writing was becoming monotonous. I didn't take the kinds of chances I was taking at one time. I thought if I'm going to end up like, um, a lot of other rock and roll celebrities, inasmuch that I'm going to be trying to retain the safe position, you know? And that's not what I started out wanting to do. But is it important to you to have a mass audience? Do you want a lot of people to... No. No. I want to work well. I want to... I just have to work well. I think it's an heroic act to take, um... to be able to obtain enthusiasm and joy from the actual process of living from day to day. Yes, very much. I try. And it is, it is I think it takes practice to, and concentration, and exercise to enjoy it. This is very easy to fall into the trap of looking for one's dreams and always thinking of a future moment when everything will be better. And if the process is not enjoyed, the dreams will never come to anything. And by enjoying the process, you are creating a dream come true. I think I have an abundantly healthy curiosity about life. About life around me, specifically. And how, how we put ourselves together culturally, and I think it's served me well as an artist, in as much as I'm really inquiring continually into how things are made and why we make them, and the significance or meanings behind things. I'd be really scared of feeling that I'd got somewhere, because for me, art is about searching, and if you come to a place where you think you've made a discovery, I think that really is... God, that would be really demoralizing. I think the search is the thing. ♪ And you want to believe ♪ ♪ And we want to believe ♪ ♪ And we want to live ♪ ♪ Oh, we want to live ♪ ♪ We want to live ♪ ♪ We want to live ♪ ♪ We want to live ♪ ♪ We want to live ♪ ♪ We want to live ♪ ♪ I want to live ♪ ♪ I want to live ♪ ♪ I want to live ♪ ♪ I want to live ♪ ♪ I want to live ♪ ♪ I want to live ♪ ♪ Live ♪ ♪ Live ♪ ♪ Live ♪ ♪ Ain't that just like me. ♪ There's a gradual shift when you reach mid 30s. Uh, I think that there's a period where you have to decide not to try and grasp frantically for the feelings of desperation and anger that you have when you're in your mid 20s. And if you can relax into the idea that being mid 30s is quite a nice place to be with an amount of experience behind you, I think the perspective changes. You said once that there's so many shells around you that you don't know what the p... looks like anymore. Yeah, well I've gone through that. I'm pretty aware of what I'm like. - Really? - Yeah, yeah. I feel pretty-pretty happy about my own relationship to the world, and... We've got to be positive about our days on this planet. I never realized you were such an optimist. Well, I never was particularly. You're more romantic than people give you credit for. I think I'm probably a lot more emotional than people would think that I was. I am emotionally very responsive to life and people. I just wanted to come in touch with a common factor because I feel a need at the moment to be part of a society again, and having traveled an awful lot, feel more and more part of everything. And I wish to express that feeling. I don't want to seem as though I'm detached and cold because I'm not. You seem very sure of yourself, and very, sort of content, and... You seem at ease with yourself. I'm at ease with myself, yeah. You've always been so good at being convincing, you know? - Whatever it was at the time. - Yeah. I see. I mean, is it possible that this - is just another role? - I see what's going on. I believe that there is a thread of meaning running through my life at the moment, that I have no wish at the moment to break, and I feel it's leading somewhere fulfilling and positive. And if I feel that way, then I make every effort to make that part of my music now. It's the ultimate swing of the pendulum. When things reach a point to one extreme, there will be a natural gravitation back to a point, which is the antithesis of that one. So, you've got a musical vocabulary, which is high-tech, and icy. There's gonna be sooner or later a swing back to, well, what is the other side of that coin? Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. David Bowie. I'd like to, um, start off the 80s in a positive, optimistic fashion. I'll be undertaking, a world tour, sometime around the middle of the year, and it'll take me through to the autumn at least. And he's back. David Bowie, launching his first new album in three years, preparing for his first British tour in five years, and telling Newsnight's Robin Denselow about his new and more emotional music style. I'm trying to write in a more obvious and positive manner. I've not gone quite into a corner with experimentation of sound. I'm not quite so concerned with cut-up exercise, or using juxtaposition of lyrics, or whatever. I'd like to do something positive. Something that helps people, to use a cliche. This is probably the simplest music I've ever done. What do you mean simple? It makes very warm, understandable musical statements. It has a warm response. I hope that it's the most emotionally uplifting music I've made in a long time. It's very positive. Is that how you're feeling? Relatively. Oh yeah.

But I think it's just a Bowie acceptance now, which is quite gratifying after all these years. Didn't think I'd ever hear myself saying this, but it's like the audience and myself are just, like, together. It's trying to come back to being a person again in terms... In the eyes of the audience, and it certainly has no pretensions to be a serious, heavy statement-filled show, but I mean, it's exactly what I want it to be. What do you most enjoy doing? In life, at the moment? Waking up and feeling as though I've got a future. I keep remembering that there is a tomorrow, when that never really occurred to me before, that there was a tomorrow. Tomorrow was really, "This is it. "This is now, this is important. "Everything else is crazy, and static, "and it means nothing, or everything's impermanent, therefore I will just live for the second." And one has to start taking very positive stands on things. When you feel comfortable with yourself, you can no longer write. That seems to be the writer's great problem. As I get more comfortable, I obviously have the feeling that it's not so much that is my writing as good, or as potent as it used to be, but do I need to write anymore? His new album seems to be, to me, a step sideways. Why do you describe it that... in that way? Because I think he's not doing anything particularly new, and I suspect that for the first time ever, the fans are up there with him and he's not ahead of the game. He seems to me to have become something rather old fashioned, which is to say a superstar. If you've gone mainstream, there's only one way to do it, and that's sell out three days a year. Really do it. Yeah, yeah. He's done it in one big deal, hasn't he? This is the last stop on what's been a pretty extensive tour for you. Uh, yeah, I'm not actually finishing in Auckland.

They were very hard years to get through to find any sense of purpose. I wasn't allowing myself the service of being who I really am as an artist. I'd given myself dreadful parameters in confining myself to merely what I presumed people wanted. I never wanted to do this. I never wanted to be out there pleasing people. I wanted to be really stubborn and have people like what I like. Not give them what they like. It's very, very easy to become work-obsessed for the reason of not having to look at oneself. I think over the last few years, I'm understanding a very important thing in my life, which is that I really have to come back to what my life is about. That my life is not about the work that I do. My work is not me. I am distinctly one entity that needs looking at. When I first looked, I just didn't understand that person, because I'd never given myself the time, nor the incentive to want to really have a look at myself, deeply. I think the first intrusion into one's own inner conflicts is not the most pleasant of experiences. But working through them can really be one of the greatest adventures of one's life, and it takes a certain amount of bravado, and need, and a realization that you're missing out on your own life. You are probably creating hazards and disturbing experiences for others around you. And the house must be put right. Do you have any room in your life for any kind of real relationship like that? More room than I've ever had before. You've said that being in love, you thought was like a disease. Yeah. Horrible, and it bred jealousy, and. I think I've...

'Cause I look at some of my mates, and some contemporaries, and I know some of them feel, I don't know, tired, or bitter, or you know, a number of things that traditionally are supposed to go with getting older, you know? And I've just been very fortunate that it just hasn't happened to me. I just feel really... I'm pretty keen on everything. I've just landed on my feet. I've done and do everything I've always wanted to do, you know? That's been... That's a great thing. Oh, it's extraordinary. It really is extraordinary. I've an incredible life. It's been amazing. I would love to do it again. I was determined, ever since I was 16, that I would have the greatest adventure that any one person could ever have. And I set my sails in the general direction of uncharted waters. I put myself through everything... Absolutely everything, that came along. It was very important for me to expand my horizons and seeing just how... Just how near to the line I could get. I've been so eclectic all my life. I've been admiring of so many different people and so many different things that they've done, I feel that I owe so many for the way that I think and do things. I guess anybody who's had the integrity to kind of always work outside of the system, has always appealed to me. Whenever I'm teetering on sort of what I know is what I do best, and what I really feel for, and there's an area that I think that, well, an audience I know would like this, I just remember back to how much I hate the center of the social strata, how I hate being drawn into the middle, to the middle of the road of anything, to that which is most popular. And if... The other thing I would say is that if you feel safe in the area that you're working in, you're not working in the right area. Always go a little further into the water than you feel you're capable of being in. Go a little bit out of your depth, and when you don't feel that your feet are quite touching the bottom, you're just about in the right place to do something exciting. Let me tell you one thing. All people, no matter who they are, they all wish they'd appreciated life more. It's what you do in life that's important, not how much time you have, or what you wish you'd done. ♪ Something happened on the day he died ♪ ♪ Spirit rose a meter then stepped aside ♪ ♪ Somebody else took his place and bravely cried ♪ ♪ I'm a black star ♪ ♪ Oooooo... ♪ There is no beginning, no end.
