According to my diaries… - According to your diaries… I decided on the piano, the piano… when I was 18 or 19, around that time. But I had doubts before that… - Why only at 18? Well, I just mean… at some point I imagined what would happen if I did something else, you know? Because I had always been very interested in acting, for example. But you stopped that when you moved to London... Well, I officially stopped when I was 9 or 10, but then I went back to taking acting lessons… But I had doubts from time to time… small doubts, like so… PIANISTS STREET Bosquet St., Brussels In 1982 the Tiempo-Lechner family settled down here, a renowned dynasty of Argentine pianists. Five years later, Martha Argerich moved to the house next door, whose doors would always be open to countless other musicians. Barely fourteen years old, Natasha Binder is the last promise of the street. It starts from this G. - E – C – E – G. From this G going to this E. Play it very slowly once. Wait, Chang. Very slowly. No, don't look at me, look there. - At this speed? Slower, slower. Hello, you have reached Martha Argerich's residence, please leave your message. Thank you. Who's coming there? The little daughter? Someday it will be incredible for you to read all these things. The sheer amount of diaries, from when I was eighteen, from I don't know when… Look, from 1980. Look, I'm barely loved, some people are scared of me… Loneliness, etc. There was a very interesting one here, about the piano. How cute! - Do you understand my handwriting? Let's see. Forrowing… No, no… Following these… instructions No, come on, let me do it! Following these instructions to a T.. the result will be disastrous. Sounds, when fingers… Move pressing keys - …move, pressing keys that are black and white. Oh really? Thank you, I wasn't aware of that! You can press several keys at once in order to obtain combined sounds. As this occurs, you can also use your right or left foot… But where did I get this from? - You were describing a piano! Here are more things, see? Take a look. At last we have reached our goal Since we arrived in Europe: finding a good piano teacher. I had my first lesson with Maestro Sancan. This is very interesting, also, knowing what happened. Because sometimes you ask me about all these things, and I don't remember everything… and here it is, all written down. It's incredible… There’s a lot like… when you are in a music school, yeah? And you see like hundreds, yeah? And you see all of them, even children already… you see the stereotypes do apply in certain cases. I mean, pianists are all like… The craziest, most eccentric ones are pianists. Really? Either you’re with a non-musician who doesn’t understand your lifestyle… maybe might be jealous… or has insecurity problems, or… Ego… - So actually, there is no rule There is always going to be one that is more successful than the other, so it’s like… Yeah, but look, between violinists, look Jeaninne and Julian. Separated, years ago. These are all wrong. Because we must leave our shoulders free and we must be well above the strings so we can move around the whole length of the fingerboard. We must have flexibility in all the joints. We must have freedom of the elbow. Perhaps little Karen, who has had almost no experience in holding the violin might show us what the first reactions are. You think this one is no good? - It is good, but wait. Ok, just a sec. I can play the piano but putting on earrings is not my thing… Ok, done. Did you get them on? Yes, perfect. I got very nervous about your earring, mom. But could it be a bit more introverted? Because I hear your boom boom. - Ok. More introverted. Ok, this was very nice. Very nice. But here I liked it better before, when you sang the notes a bit more. It's not introverted like the beginning. Can we try it? From here? I love it. Don't you like it? I like it a lot more, Natasha. - Ok. Do you want to try number 1? No. Because we won't be playing it. I mean, we can't play two encores from Dolly… No, but… ok, ok. On the other hand, we can play the other Brahms… We should talk about this with Sergio, but… Do you want to try number 6? Let's try number 6… Do you want me to act like you usually do? What do you mean? Oh mom, can't you see I'm tired? - But you are not tired! What? - Just kidding… doesn't matter. Found them. I'm not sure if this is interesting for you, I found these ones from '78, I was thirteen. A year younger than you, and I was much more… Look, Piano, I don't know if this is interesting for you, but it's closer to your age. - A year younger than me. Did you say older? - No, a year younger. I'm turning thirteen. Do you have something about me? But darling, this was way before you came along… Colón Theater. Played there for the first time. My debut. Everything fine. Thrilling experience. Great audience, several autographs, not too many… After dinner, went to bed at 3 A.M. Wow… 22nd May, 1980 Writing just for its own sake may not make much sense, but it makes me feel good. It may seem odd, but writing helps me trust myself more. I listen to everyone that surrounds me, because I still need the advice and opinions of my elders. But one must grow. And in most cases I feel that my way is the best. that's why I've decided to work more, and I want to challenge myself to be a good and serious musician. Which is not easy at all, because you can't make it with talent alone. From now on, I'll feel the sacrifice in this career. Fortunately, music is my main interest. And even though I sometimes feel the need to use my time for other activities - like swimming, writing, going to school, etcetera - I feel capable of sacrifice. Mom was right: life is all about sacrifice. …is the title Schumann gave to this immortal work, which should be conceived as a kind of intimate reverie. Right? It's not just about achieving a beautiful sound or expressive phrasing One should create a sense of dream. The truth is, one should dream this piece, rather than play it. Would you allow me to take your place? Wow. It's a step higher. Or half a step. No, a step. And here, don't connect these two phrases. They are different elements I'm scared of his look… of those eyes! of a same musical condition. And here, like a question of sorts… And here again, tenderly… questioning the future. And from this moment on, the piece reaches - not by music itself, but by a stroke of genius - immortality. Impressive! Great. And have you tried playing it like that? No. But you had to study those things granny Babasha told you. Did you try them upstairs? - Yes, I did. The piano upstairs is useless; it's too soft. You have to go downstairs. We are working there, nowadays… Is your daddy too strict during your piano lessons? No. - No? Is he kind? But sometimes… - But sometimes… But he is kind like my mother. Thank you very much… She is well prepared already; she knows what to say… Everyone in the family is a pianist. - She is already 99 years old. She is a pianist too? - Yes, she was my father's teacher. Oh well… It's a bit like the Tiempos' story. - Like the Tiempos, exactly. It's Karin, right? It's Mendelssohn. - Yes, it's Mendelssohn. So it's Karin. It must be awful to practice when you know every single note is being heard… Oh, yes, it's terrible… Especially with a neighbor like this one... And how about when Martha is home! - Yes. Nobody practices? When you must, you must… Repeat it once again, please. We should call them. Hey! The ones playing Mendelssohn! Please once more! - Encore! Once again, we're trying to figure out what it is. And next time, when you start over, you should play a whole program here. This one takes after Mila quite a bit. - Do you think so? Am I the only one who thinks so? - No, I don't think so. Had you already seen that picture, Natasha? No. Well, just for a second. Is this you? How old were you there? Here, fifteen. Or fourteen. Yes, fourteen, like you. No way! You look older! A lot older! - Babasha… Babasha what? - …fantastic body! You seem impressed. Why did they wear that over their heads? Bathing caps, they were used around that time. This is the photo I remember. From Mozart's Triple Concerto. It's strange how you played side by side… My father was playing all of Mozart's Concerti in Radio El Mundo. So he said he would play the one for two pianos with my mother as usual, and for the Triple Concerto they said they would have me on. In my father's words: Lyl could do the third piano. Really? - Can't you see? Yes, but I didn't know. There's so much you don't know, sweetie… Who is next in line? - Natasha Binder! Pour a few drops here… - Sure. This morning I fixed a fruit salad for myself! She ate all kinds of berries! - I can't believe it. What was the fruit salad like? - Raspberries and bananas. And… sugar. But… it was fruit! - Well done! But wait a moment, there were all kinds of berries and she ate them all. Natasha, are your classmates coming to the concert? Yes. - Oh, are they? Yes, there's Jamie, you know her… also Lily, who's coming with her mom. And what about your teachers? My French teacher asked if she could come. Yes, I said, bring more people! And your math teacher was very eager to come - her last name is Schubert. You know, my History teacher is the best teacher I've ever had, because she loves what she does. She studied millions of things. So we were talking about prehistory and cave paintings, and she asked us: Does anybody here make art, draw, or play music? So then I raised my hand. Just a bit… Natasha, why do you play the piano? That's a great question! - And you never asked yourself that! Then I answer… Well… because I like it! So then she says Oh, ok. and starts asking the others, and they all reply, Because I like it. Finally, she says: well, don't you think it's possible that they painted because they liked doing it? - Also because they liked it, exactly! That's so nice! - Absolutely! Sergio, when you went to school, did you have teachers like the ones Natasha was describing? - Yes, I had some excellent teachers. My teacher was there when Sergio went to school. Which one? - Miss Boucher. Oh, but she never taught me. - When you were in school, did you already know you definitely wanted to be a pianist? No, not at all… not at all. - Not even in the end? Not even! - And when was that? Yes, when did you decide? The thing is, it's very strange, because I was already a pianist, so it was difficult to decide to be a pianist… it's like suddenly deciding to be a human being… that's what I am, so how could I know? - But it is different, anyway… No, deciding on a profession, that's the issue… but when you are already a musician, a pianist, when you've been doing it your whole life… the decision is strange, because it is not a decision at all. Very well, thank you very much, darling. She is very kind and collaborative. We are ready, all of us are ready…! And now... I want the mommy! - You want the mommy? The mommy is not coming now. Because we have to do the drums, so who is coming? You know who it is? That's right! Let's hear those drums, very well prepared. Daddy! - How scary! Wait for it… That's great! Such nice drums! Should we show daddy how we hop on the trains? Can we sing for daddy, cutie pie? The fattest of them all is… The fattest or the biggest? The fattest. - Ok. The fattest of them all is the daddy, then comes the mommy. The tallest one is the brother, who takes the other one by the hand. The little girl comes behind, and they all go for a stroll. All the little fingers will sleep well. Bye bye. Chau chau. Au revoir. - G… C… Prizes, I want the prizes. What color do you want them? - Green and blue. Those are for you, my love. Come here, sweetie. I want the treble clef foot. No, I need the treble clef foot, darling… You see how strange? - It's weird, really… Mine are super sweaty. - They are super sweaty! What's going on? - I don't know… Ok. Try going like this. Let's try… don't turn the page. Actually, I'll try like this. But not fast, not fast. I had this teacher who said that in case of repeated notes, one should raise and lower the wrist. What was that piece I played with tons of repeated notes? Is it better? Mom, could we not talk while we play, and then we can go back? But I didn't talk while we played, or did I? A bit… but it doesn't matter! - Ok. So that we can do the other ones from start to finish, numbers 4 and 5, and then if there is something to say, we can do them again. Agreed. You were saying things like pianissimo and whatnot… While we were playing. - Right. If I don't say it right when it happens, I sometimes forget… I know… but it's very difficult to enjoy it otherwise. You must sing that A a bit more. I'm sorry to talk, but there you… Ok, then let's start again. - Sure, but for example, you see there? When you have to make a note fuller, according to my taste, I have to say it immediately, otherwise… - Ok, understood. Ok, can we go on? How is the fourth movement coming along? Good. And that part is repeated lots of times. Which is the difficult part in that movement? Sing it for me. I know which one… No, no. It doesn't seem that hard to me. Yes, I know. No. Can I speak or not? No, because… you're so annoying. Now I've lost my thread. I can't remember what I wanted to say. Oh, the fugue! Because at one point the hands have to cross a lot, and that's hard. And did you try that part… the legato, as I taught you? - But it's not hard. Right? No, it's not hard, but Schumann asks for a legato with the fingers, not just with the pedal. Did you try that? - I think so. And so? - I don't remember. So you didn't try it. Next question, on bar number 55, bottom of the page, when it goes… I think it should go… The rhythm. - It's a quarter-note on the score. It's not on the score, but I think it's way cooler… So it's like a sixteenth: ba-boom Yes, like that, a sixteenth. And then, comes… I went like this… And you left it at... Do you like it? Yes, yes, without the quarter-note. - Ok. So, little Karin, are you studying? What are you doing? Well, I started looking at a score; I'll tell you about it later, because… I'll show you when you come, I'm liking it quite a bit. Ok. And besides that, taking care of Natasha a bit, things are better with Natasha… so, distracted with several things. Now I'm waiting for Debrus, who's coming with Colette, our manager, to talk about the projects with our trio… I don't know if I want to go away next week. I agree, it's best if you stay. - But I wanna have a week of vacations. And what about Spain? Isn't that vacations? No. - How come? Because I will be studying there. - Well but only two hours per day, the rest will be vacations. - But still, if I'm not in Brussels the other week I should be studying as hard as I can, right? Honestly, mom. - Is that so? Right? If I'm in Brussels I won't skip studying. The second piece should be ready. - I know, but I'm not talking about that. Ok, never mind. - What are you talking about? Nothing, never mind. Where are we? Good question. I knew how to hold up, I kept calm and never lost control. I went through new and uncomfortable situations, and I said to myself that everything would turn out fine, that there was no real reason to get angry or nervous. I learned how to enjoy every good moment, really enjoying it to the fullest. There are very few good moments because life is hard. I realized that I was the only one that didn't constantly complain about everything. I remembered mom's words on greatness and how very few people achieve it. It became absolutely clear: everything was a reason to complain: sleepiness, hunger, fatigue, heat, dressing rooms, people, etc. I couldn't understand them. I thought: Dear music, you help me think better than anyone or anything. I didn't choose this life and now I'm being forced to follow the rules of the game, these horrible rules that I refuse to learn. I can't allow myself to wallow… What's this? Poor little daughter, I understand her perfectly and I take pity on her. I still remember her when she was a child, how much I loved her, how much I still love her - What's that all about? You'll see, just keep on listening. Now she's another person. Or is she the same Karin, who is now an adult? I let her follow her path and I rejoice when she can walk on her own. I suffer silently when she falls, when she hurts herself, when she gets dizzy but I let her go on. Her growing up reminds me inevitably of my old age. I am not the young mother anymore. I don't have many years left. But I'm glad to see her like this: healthy, strong, intelligent, sturdy; I trust her, and she makes me happy and proud. That is why I forgive her; I forgive when she mistreats me, her aggressions, her hatred towards me Because I understand her all too well, so I wait. I wait for it to go away, I wait until she stops walking dizzily and clumsily. Perhaps - hopefully - halfway in that long, lonely walk she might look back and see a face in the distance. And discover that face to be her mother's. She might smile at her mother and thank her with her eyes, as she continues her journey. How beautiful. Well, the… The idea: I wrote it as if it were Grandma Babasha, get it? We're almost there! Let's put everything away. Are you sure? - Yes, this is the stop. There he is! Hello, Martin! Good to see you. How are you? I’m fine, just growing a little bit, yeah? So Shostakovich, do you want to try? Why try, let’s just do it! -OK, let’s do it then. It’s next door? Or is it the first floor? - This is next door. This is Martha. I can’t believe she’s awake. Yeah, this is Martha. I can’t believe she’s awake My god, she's losing her mind. After the Scherzo it gets… - Absolutely. Yes, of course! I don't know if it's very good, but it's good. No, that's for me. - No. What? - You should avoid putting on weight… Half, give me half. Natasha, I need something sweet to go with my coffee! Don't be mean…! Natasha! Don't be stingy. No! - Natasha! Wait. Ok, I'll ask for another one. I had dreams like those but I can't recall. I remember one but I can't seem to remember when or what… I knew perfectly well what I was supposed to play, and I knew how it sounded in my head, I knew what it was, but when I sat down at the piano… You couldn't remember a thing. I can't believe it! I didn't have the slightest clue of what I had to do, I was at the piano, there was a huge audience and I didn't know what to do. That's the worst. - No, the worst one was… When was that? A thousand years ago, maybe last year… The worst one was when I knew perfectly well what to do, but I sat at the piano and no sound came out of it. - Are you serious? I've had that happen with my voice. - In dreams or in real life? No, in dreams. That somebody follows me and I scream but my voice doesn't come out. I don’t remember who I was with, she comes and she says “Go outside, get fresh air,talk about Justin Bieber! She’s obsessed with Justin Bieber. She uses him in class all the time as an example. How boring… What do you want to do when you are older? - I want to be like, a filmmaker. Really? - I want to make scripts and then be the director. Natasha, what about you? Oh, I’m not answering it. - What do you want to be? No comments. I don’t know! I don’t want to say something and then like in thirty years go like “aahhh”. Don’t you want to be like a pianist or something? She said she doesn't know! - I said I don’t know. Let time decide. - I know, OK? I’m just trying to push her to her boundaries. Sergio Daniel… Now that Karin has finished playing her first Scene from Childhood, and that you are both here with me, I know that you would love for me to tell you a story. - No, I want to play the piano… You want to play? Ok, you'll do that. We will do many things: we will play, we will have fun, we will tell things... - Will we play the piano? We'll make music and also sing. You know what? In this tape we're making, I will tell you about the story of our lives, all three of our lives. Well, I should actually start by telling my story. But before telling my story, then Karin's and finally Sergio's… Karin, what would you play now? Scarlatti. - Really? Let's go to the piano, then! How many pianos are there in this house? Martha has two, three… five pianos, I think. Let's see if we can pull it off. The most difficult part is the beginning, actually. But then… And another thing… something about the sound, a bit more… huh? - I got it. A bit more inside the… The leg. - Inside the leg. Ok, I think we should stop. - Really? Yes, because we're in the point of no return. I mean, diminishing returns The more we try, the less we get. Come here, kid, grab a seat, join the adults' conversation, grow up! You don't get nervous before concerts. - For a while I didn't, but then I started getting nervous. - It has already started, then. It's like I've finally become aware of what it meant… Oh, ok, so you're in, right… But you do. - What? You do get nervous. - Always. And when I don't get nervous, I get nervous because I didn't get nervous. You know what I mean? Because I'm super worried… how come? How come I'm not nervous? Then I must be in an awful shape. What happens to me is that my fingers never get warm. Ever. In a concert, my fingers are always cold. - You end up with cold fingers. I start, I finish… I can do a billion scales and Chopin studies in the dressing room and my fingers, still two ice cubes! Frozen. - What an awful sensation! It's as if they didn't move at all! You know what you should do? Wash your hands with cold water. I do it now, every time. - You have to be brave enough… No, it's perfectly fine! You wash yourself with cold water, and the body starts to send blood to that part to balance out the temperature. So when the cold from the water goes away, two or three minutes later your hands get warmer. I do it every time my hands are cold: I wash them with ice-cold water. Clearly, you shouldn't wash them and go on stage right away! All wet and slippery! That must be Martha, don't answer, don't answer! No, everything is fine… we've been practicing here… Exactly: for example, I don't like it when people hear me practicing… Well, you've definitely chosen the wrong street, then! That came out all wrong. - Oh, you mean I picked the wrong spot. Well, you have to get used to it. - Yeah, don't practice! Simply because there are very intimate things about me that transpire… evidently, not everybody can tell right away, but I feel it that way. I feel that I'm so involved that I can't conceal anything. However, I am able to do that at other times. But not there. That's why studying in a place where everybody is listening… it's a bit… do you get that too? - Yes. They say Liszt hated that. Clementi, who was in London or somewhere, asked that the rooms next to his should be empty. There had to be a free room at each side because he didn't like to be heard. This is wrong. But do you think I should do it more…? Can't you ask yourself? - Yes, but I am out of answers, I really need you to tell me. This is the final note from Scenes from Childhood. Well, I could stress this one more. OK, why don't you try that? - No, I shouldn't stress this one, because it's the first and last time it appears. Right? And here… right? It's like the farewell of the farewell. - Exactly. Exactly. You know when you say goodbye to someone and you say bye right before you enter the car or wherever? And then you say goodbye from the car. Is the second farewell more distant? - Well, the second farewell is… The second one? It can't be more emphatic. It comes from farther away. No, precisely! Because it's like the kiss before the departure. Oh… so you feel this one is more emphatic because it's the one marking the pain of separation. - And musically, because it's the first and last time it appears… - That is very interesting. I find it very, very interesting. It would go like… Now I like this ending. - Is that the one you were looking for? Is that the one? I don't know. It's hard for me. 96.7 FM. Classical, public, and Argentine. 22nd march, 2014 Dear Natasha: I would like to share with you this new experience in my life with Mendelssohn's First Concerto. So many things happen from the time you start preparing a piece until you finish it… it actually feels like a pregnancy and a musical birth. When this Concerto was chosen, the first thing I did was look into my old recordings, to see when I had played it before. Because listening to oneself is as difficult as playing. It's a confrontation with the past - a picture from before. And the reactions might be very different according to each case. Fifteen years had gone by. I knew that it would be a different version now. Not better or worse, just another one, with other nuances, and another kind of maturity. I'll go on later. Kisses, Mom. Let's talk a bit about this mother-daughter relationship. Pianist mother… pianist daughter? - Teenage pianist daughter. All of that, yes. - What do you think will happen to her? Let's pretend we're psychic. - No, I don't like wondering what will be of her. I prefer talking in present tense, because what will happen depends on what happens now. And I concentrate a lot on making Natasha's life as balanced as possible: at school, with her social life… actually, her social life first, then piano, school and everything she has… so well, it's a complicated moment and we are handling it the best we can. We'll make things clear for the audience. Natasha is Natasha Binder, also a child prodigy like her mother. Both were taught by Lyl Tiempo, who is Natasha's grandmother and Karin's mother. And Natasha is already a teenager, with everything it means. A sigh from her mother, please… take a deep breath and… we release the air, we liberate… 96.7 FM. Classical, public, and Argentine. 22nd march, 2014. Dear Natasha: I would like to share with you this new experience in my life with Mendelssohn's First Concerto. So many things happen from the time you start preparing a piece until you finish it… it actually feels like a pregnancy and a musical birth. Your writing is great, mom. - Really? So why are you laughing? Mine is good too, because I got an A. - In English? The highest grade? Wow, congratulations, honey. So, did you like the letter? Huh? - Did you like it? I liked it. - Ok, my love, go eat then. No, I'm fine, I'm not…! Mom, I want you back home! Oh, sweetie… - I want you back home… What for? So that we can fight a little bit? No, I want to hug you… - Aw, pumpkin, so do I… I always miss your hugs when you are gone. Really? - I love your hugs. You do? Ok, we'll hug a million times when I get back. Great. - Go eat with the folks, ok? Ok. Kisses! I'm going to hug you a lot when I… she hung up! No, don't eat my shirt! Should we go to the piano? - Oh, the little brooches fell off. No, I took them off on purpose. I'll put them back on. No! - Will you put them on? Go over there; I have to study with auntie Karin. Come on, Mila… Be careful… there you go. Now you can get out. That way. I'm going downstairs. - You're leaving? You're not even saying goodbye? And the last one? Mila, my love… is very beautiful… I know how to do it on my own, Babasha! Really? You know how to do it alone? OK, my love, so I won't go with you. Do you want me to play the chord? is very pretty… Mila my love… Mila my love… Mila my love… is very nice… I can do it on my own! I don't want you to help me with the hand! Ok, tell this hand not to come and help you. Tell it, tell it! You should tell the hand. - I'll tell it. Treble clef hand, right hand: don't help Mila. Alright! Mommy loves… Daddy loves her… But, you helped me! - It disobeyed me! …many, many, many loves. - Ok, question time. When I was in mommy's tummy… - Yes? I knew that I would have a granny like Babasha, and I also knew that she would teach me how to play the piano. But how could you know that from the tummy, Natasha? Because I knew so. - You did? You have to believe it. Darling, if you say so, I believe it. Sure I do. Need any help, sweetie? - No. If you need any help ask Eva, you'll surely treat her better than me. May I see something? In the back it's a bit off. There's a tiny stain there. - Oh, oh. You can take it out with cold water. Mom, you take it out with cold water. No, no… - Mom… Let me see if I can play… - Let's see if you can. But sing it! Sound effects, please. Good. We were talking about possible encores. Do you think we should do this one? Number 15 from Brahms. Yes, it's very nice. I could hear from upstairs. More than number 6. - Because Natasha wants… No, that one doesn't fit. It doesn't go as well as the other one. I feel the same. I told you she would agree with me. And also people know that one… - Exactly! Not only that, but it also evokes children and babies. I told her exactly those two things! - I've heard that all day… How old was I when I did that concert? - Thirteen, exactly. Ok, more or less. - What do you mean more or less? I was also thirteen when… Yes, you turned thirteen before turning fourteen. True. It was a bit hard for me… - And before playing in Washington, you played that same concert in the University of Miami. Do you remember? Yes, I read that in your diaries! - You did? I read that! Good review, whatnot… Don't you remember? How could I recall every little thing I wrote in my diaries? There was a very good review about the concert in Washington. But mom, don't you remember your travel diary, with that table where you wrote down all the travels, dates, people…? So there you saw it. - It was right there. Do you know that masterclass by Cortot? Oh, when he says those extraordinary things about this piece. It's marvelous. - Oh, with that voice… It's marvelous. And when he plays it, wonderful! He plays this piece? - Yes… Allow me to take your place… Remember? It's the little girl who's playing, right? Natasha? Yes. And when did I leave here? The 9th… - October? Yes. I don't know how long it has been since I was here last. It's incredible. - What is? You play more and more every time. - Yes, too much, right? More concerts and a wider repertoire in less time. Yes. When you get to be my age, you won't make it. But I think it's the other way around... I'm leaving. Oh, that sadness… - …has no end. happiness does. Wait a second. Granny Babasha, could you cut it out for a moment? Yes, darling, I'll turn it off. But could you throw a little kiss first? How will I see the conductor? No, the conductor will be up here, with the orchestra on stage. See? They are putting everything together… - The piano goes there. Oh, the vertigo! I'm feeling vertigo. I have vertigo. Aw, my darling! - Great granny! My love, so beautiful! Does history repeat itself, ma'am? Are you running a pianist factory? History does not repeat itself, Boris. Could you repeat the phrase, so I can steal it? History can't repeat itself. Life keeps flowing. According to my diaries… - According to your diaries… I decided on the piano, the piano… when I was 18 or 19, around that time. But I had doubts before that… - Why only at 18? Well, I just mean… at some point I imagined what would happen if I did something else, you know? Because I had always been very interested in acting, for example. But you stopped that when you moved to London.. Well, I officially stopped when I was 9 or 10, but then I went back to taking acting lessons… But I had doubts from time to time… small doubts, like so… In your case, I don't know, right? What do you mean? No, I mean, you don't have to be like me… I know… - You are your own person... I know that very well… and it doesn't matter… you'll see when the time comes. The other day we were saying that we look nothing alike. But I don't look like my dad either… - Oh, we talked with mom about that! Really? - Yes, that we look nothing alike. She thinks so too? - She thinks so too. And what about our playing? - No, it has nothing to do. No, our playing is absolutely different. - Absolutely, right? Take your Scenes from Childhood: nothing to do with mine when I was 12. Because the way you play is related to the way you are. Exactly, it is intimately related. Well, thank god we play differently! And what about our Poet? No, nothing to do. - Where is the difference? I loved the way you played it the other day, Natasha. You did? - You are playing it very convincingly… Thanks, mom! …a family of pianists from Argentina, with an international reputation, they will play this evening mostly in duo. Not only will they play different kinds of classical music, but they will also play tangos, which are reminiscent of their roots. Having played here… I love it… No, no! What's wrong? Come on, you have to go on stage now! Come on, there! - But I liked it… I played it loudly. So do it loudly, then! Come on. No, sweetie, do it right. Come on, let's do it right. Let's erase everything… and now we do it correctly, ok? Again. Should we start this and play The family as it comes down? Yes. - Great, let's do it. PIANISTS STREET
