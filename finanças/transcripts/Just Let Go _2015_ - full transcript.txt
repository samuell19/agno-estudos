Under provision one, we will secede negligent cause if Mr. Williams can identify Mr. Wright. You ever seen Mr. Curtis Wright before this week? Uh, just in the snippets on the news. They didn't really show his face, though. So you didn't see him at the scene of the accident? Uh, yes, well, no, I'm sor... uh... It was dark. But I saw his, uh, silhouette. Did you see anyone else driving that SUV? No. So you never really saw Mr. Wright driving that car. I think it's been well established that Mr. Wright was driving that night. That's what we're here to determine, Mr. Williams. Earlier you stated, after the accident, that you "woke up". - Did you fall asleep at the wheel? - No. It had been a long week, you said. Were you exhausted? I was a little tired, I suppose... Is it possible that you had a seizure that night? - Absolutely not. - Ever had a seizure before? Excuse me, what are you getting at here? I'm not at fault. Then just answer the questions, please. In the police report you stated that your foot was all the way down on that accelerator. Immediately after impact, "revving the engine," you said. When did you push down so hard on the accelerator? Wait, wait, what? Your foot was jammed down on the accelerator. That happened just before the accident, didn't it? I suppose it was it was a result of the accident... the crash. Have you ever thought about suicide, Mr. Williams? - Is that before or accident? - Really, Mark? Your client decimated this man's family. We're done here. My client has rights too. You should be ashamed. - We'll see you in court. - Thank you. - Give me the bills. - What did you do? What are you doing? Chris? What are you doing? Tidying up. I guess you think this is funny. I wish you'd let some lawyers handle this for you. This shouldn't have to cost you any money. What's wrong with you? Look at this, all these lawyers. They sent you letters.

Mm-hmm. - Where are you going with those? - You know what these are, Mom? - You're not going to do this again. - Ambulance chasers. I don't think that's very funny. - Oh... What are you doing? - Hey, Sammy. Who's gonna pay for these bills, Chris? - I don't know. - What's in your mind? - What's the plan? - I don't know, Ma! Oh. I guess you're surprised about this.

Is the defense prepared with its opening statement? Yes, Your Honor. The defense proposes that the defendant, Curtis Wright, be tried in this case as a juvenile. He was 17 at the time the accident occurred, and thus, under law, he is entitled to juvenile status in any court proceedings. Those are the facts. The law is very clear in this matter. He should be remanded to a juvenile detention where he can receive counseling for the trauma sustained from the accident. Admittedly, he may need some treatment for alcohol disease... not incarceration. Thank you, Your Honor. Is that you in that photo? That's me. And there, can you point yourself out in that photo, please? That one's me. Do you know where these photos were taken from? Um, from my cell phone? Is that Mr. Wright next to you? - Yes. - Was Mr. Wright drinking that evening? He may have had a little. Define a little. He had a whole bottle with him at the store. It was in his jacket. A bottle. Of what? It looked like vodka. Vodka. Did you consider stopping him from driving? No. No further questions for this witness, Your Honor. Witness is dismissed. Your Honor, we'd like to present state's evidence items regarding photos taken at the scene of the crash. Items 200A thru 252A. All right, present your evidence. Thank you. The first photo you see is of the Williams vehicle. You'll notice that the right side is completely crushed. The Williams family vehicle was knocked 40 feet backwards, up a ramp, into the support pillars of an overpass. Mr. Wright's vehicle, you'll see there, was overturned, 48 feet from the Williams vehicle. Mr. Wright's injuries... ...were minimal. Right torso. Abrasions to the crown of his head. And his left arm. Samuel Williams survived the impact with critical injuries to his head and face. Photo 222. You'll see the Williams girl, Anna, age nine, autopsied. And the son, Ben, age 11, at the scene. And autopsied. Please note the signific... Please note the significant damage to his right torso, evidence of severe trauma. If you'll go to the next photo, you'll see the mother, Michelle Williams, age 34, autopsied. Note her right arm. I'd also like you to note... This is autopsy filing February 9th, 2007. Note 15. I've highlighted it, I'll read it here. "The artery was detached from the heart due to the force of side impact, certainly due to speeds in excess of 80 miles per hour". The final photos you'll see there are of the infant. Five months. Died instantly... ...in utero. And autopsied. Chris. It's time. Please state your full name for the record. Christopher Darnie Williams. Would you please tell us what happened on the night of February 9th, 2007? Um, it was, uh... Heh... It was like any other night. We had just, uh, had dinner at our favorite Mexican restaurant and we decided to get some ice cream. We traveled down a road we'd done a thousand times. It's a freeway underpass, and as we were going under, Michelle saw... two headlights coming at us in our lane at freeway speeds. I tried to swerve, but I was... I was too late, the car was too fast. And then nothing, uh... Everything just went white. When I came to, my leg was trapped. My foot was pushed up against the gas pedal down to the floor and I thought there might be a fire, so I pulled my leg away. And... And that's when I saw Michelle. She had a... she had a cut on her elbow. And it wasn't bleeding. And I-I knew from my time... ...as a... as a teenager working in a hospital, that, ah... her heart had stopped. She was gone. And then I, I heard, uh... a new sound. A horrible sound. First I didn't know what it was. It wasn't the revving of the car engine. I realized it was me. ...Dad? I immediately knew that Ben and Anna were gone. Then I heard Sam... Sam cry out. He was behind me, and... And I knew he was gonna be okay. Then I saw this... someone get out of the car that hit us. Did it appear as though he were fleeing? Yeah, well, I'm not sure. He just seemed to be... wandering away from his car. Can you confirm that this is the vehicle you saw? Yes. Yes, it is.

We're getting some raw, documentary-style footage of the trip. Okay, look, it just doesn't make any sense to travel all that distance, waste all that gas, when we can get there so much quicker. Well... It doesn't make sense to go at all, then. I mean, why go? We came for the fireflies. It doesn't make any sense, honey. Sometimes life's about doing things that don't make sense.

This is the defendant's vehicle. - You can see from the damage there the impact that caused the car to flip. When a car flips, that means typically the vehicle is traveling in excess of 75 miles an hour. There was 200 feet between you and the other vehicle. And, at that speed, there was absolutely no way you could have avoided a collision. Turn right, left, straight, brakes... None of it would have mattered with that kid's SUV. - And he walked away. - They always do. Their buzz... It makes them more relaxed at the time of impact. - It's ironic. - It's infuriating, you mean. Yeah, well. It's not your fault. Chris... We only get one shot at this. ♪♪ After Mr. Wright failed the breathalyzer, the sheriff certified that he had a blood alcohol level of .1 percent. But this measurement was taken nearly an hour after the crash, suggesting that he may indeed have had an even higher blood alcohol level when he picked up his keys... and got into his SUV. The law makes a distinction between child and adult because children do childish things. But adults are accountable for their actions. The question is whether Mr. Wright was simply juvenile in his behavior or if he should take responsibility for the damages and the tremendous and ongoing pain he inflicted on the Williams family. They died... because of conscious and deliberate decisions made by Mr. Wright. Now, Mr. Wright wanted to be an adult. He certainly drank like an adult. But now he wants to insult the memories of his victims... with his request to be considered, just one more time, just for a moment, a child. Would it that it were that easy. Do overs don't exist in the real world. And they shouldn't exist in the court of law. The state strongly recommends that Mr. Wright stand trial as an adult. This was manslaughter. Just as sure as if he'd picked up a gun; only this time, he got in his car. Thank you. Is the defense ready with its final statement? Yes, Your Honor. One mistake. He was a juvenile who made one mistake. Wrong place, wrong time. Are we going to take away his whole life for this? One accident, one mistake. He had no prior record. He was just a kid in high school who made a stupid decision. The fact is, this young man is a juvenile. The state may not like that fact, but he was 17 when the accident occurred. He must be tried as a juvenile. So the law states. Thank you. Before I render my decision, there is one more opinion I would like to take under careful consideration. I would like to ask you a question, Mr. Williams. In your opinion, should the court try Mr. Wright as a juvenile or an adult? Mr. Williams? You do have an opinion on how Mr. Wright should be tried? I believe the responsibility of that decision... is up to you, Your Honor. But I will say this. He's already been given a life sentence. We both have. No matter what you decide. I just hope... he can... honor the memory of those who died by making something of his life. I don't want retribution, I just... I just want what's best for Curtis. All rise. You may be seated. All right. We've seen and heard a lot of testimony in this case, some of it very difficult. It is the opinion of this court that the defendant, Curtis Wright, shall be tried appropriate to his age as a juvenile. His maximum sentence shall not exceed three years, or until he turns the age of 21. This court is now adjourned. Congratulations, counselor. Well... you really threw us under the bus. Michael? Where have you been? I was taking a walk. At 4:00 in the morning? It helps me think. Get your brother. We're gonna go for a ride. I used to bring your Mom out here a lot when we first married. I'm sorry, Michael. I'm having a really... hard time filling Mom's shoes. I brought you here to... ...to tell you about my accident. Forget it, Dad. Every time I hear it... ...I get freaked out. That's not the accident that I want to tell you about. I want to talk to you about something that happened 30 years ago. I was about your age. I was driving home from my... from my new job at the hospital and uh... I heard a thump. Like, uh, someone threw a rock or a ball or something at the side of the car. And I stopped the car and I looked out the side of the window, and all I could see was this small boy standing there. He didn't seem upset or hurt. He seemed fine. A neighbor had called the police and they... They put me in the back of the police car. The police officer, he asked me a million questions. He wrote down every detail I could recall, I... I hadn't been speeding, I wasn't distracted. And I was confused, I said, "Why are all these people around my car?" And he said, "There's a boy trapped in the wheel well of your car." See, the big brother had chased the little brother out into the street... What happened to him? The little brother. He died a few days later, Sam. You killed the boy? I didn't know what to do or think... I was just weighed down with... with guilt and fear. I took this lady's, this man's son from them. And even though I knew it was an accident, it still didn't help, I felt... I was lost for a long time. His mother, she, uh... She wrote me this. "Dear Chris, I believe that you, Chris, were chosen to bring about the physical change in James that caused him to leave this world through death. Because of the physical damage to our little boy, it made it easier for us to let him go. It was his time. Believe in God, Chris. He loves you. Let this comfort you. Work for Him. He has wonderful things in store for you. And always remember... We have forgiven you." I had no idea, Dad. I'm sorry, Dad. Thank you, son. ♪♪ Mom would be happy right now. All of her men, together like this. Hello? - Is this Mr. Williams? - Yes? Mr. Williams, my name is Mrs. Verdant, over at the County Juvenile Detention Center. Uh... Yes? I've been assigned to work with Curtis Wright, about the accident. We're doing a form of empathy therapy with him. Uh, what's that? Curtis would like to talk to you. We were wondering if you could come down to the facility and meet with him on Friday. Many times, I asked, "Why me? Why did this happen to me?" Then I guess that I came to the conclusion... "Why not me?" Our family was very close. God knew our family bond would survive... ...and we'd be together again in the next life. I've discovered how the story of the Prodigal Son is very like my story. A teenage boy seemingly threw his life away. For what? For nothing, for some alcohol, and crashed into my family, taking them from me. I was the good son, the jealous one. I resented my father for giving the wayward son the fatted calf. He survived, he... he had his family. He could still write his own future. I... wanted to take something from him... Because he took... ...so much from me. I wanted to take his freedom. And then I realized... that wasn't my job. That was in Christ's hands. I nearly got in the way... of a son returning home to his father... finding his way home. I had to let it go. Hi, Mom. Come sit by me. I have something to say. Okay. What did I do now? Chris, I love you for wanting to forgive. I really do. I don't know if I can. I don't even know if I want to. It was such a big loss for me. It's just who I am. I'm gonna see him. He asked me to visit him in juvenile prison and... I hope I can offer him some comfort. Oh! The, uh... the bills got paid. - Really? - There's a... there's a state fund, fines levied against criminal offenders. They... they're gonna cover the costs. You were brilliant today. Brilliant. Uh, Christopher Williams to see Curtis Wr- - Identification below, please. - Uh, my ID... Stand here until the door shuts, please. All right. - Mr. Williams. - Yes. - I'm Mrs. Verdant. - Nice to meet you. Thank you for being here. I really think that this is going to help Curtis. Are you okay? Yeah. Curtis, this is Mr. Williams. You can call me Chris. Curtis has prepared some questions to ask you, Chris. He'd like to try to understand what you've been going through. - Sure. - Okay. Fire away. "What was Michelle like?" "What was Ben like?" "Anna?" "Getting any better for you?" You ask a lot of questions. Reminds me of my son, Michael. "Is there anything that I can do to make it... to make it up to you or to help?" No. Not really. "How did you survive?" Sometimes... it seemed like... there were... angels helping me. Guardian angels. Curtis. Is there anything else you'd like to ask Chris? Why didn't you hate me... ...after everything that I've done to your family? How is it that you're able to forgive me? It wasn't me, Curtis. I'm nothing. You destroyed me. You destroyed my life. And I wanted to destroy you... many times. Someday, when you have a wife and children... you'll really understand what you took from me. And now you're living in a prison of guilt and regret. But you don't need to. I don't want you to. When I saw your car for the first time... and I didn't know who you were or why this was happening to me... And just as... Just as the pain of my broken ribs was starting to kick in, and... the pain of my crushed life... my wife, my kids, sitting dead next to me... Just as it was all crashing in, I heard a voice. And the voice was a command, it wasn't... it wasn't a suggestion. And it was a distinct voice, and I-I could hear it just over my left shoulder. And it said... it said, "Let it go". Whose voice was it? I'm not sure. But it was speaking to both of us, Curtis. You need to do as much as you can... ...to repair the damage you've done. Help other people, somehow. Then pick a date, and after that date... You need to let it go. You need to let it all just go. Thank you. Thank you. ♪♪ P eople say to me all the time, "I couldn't do what you did."
