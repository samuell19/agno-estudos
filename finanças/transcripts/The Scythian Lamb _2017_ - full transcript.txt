"The seed will come to sprout..." "and produce the lamb of the Tatar." "This sheep will be raised into a tree... "with its blood as sweet as honey..." "and its flesh as tender as fish." "But only the wolf will devour it." from the "Eastern Diary" Ministry of Justice Rehabilitation Program Tsukisue. -Yes We have six candidates coming. Could you take care of them? Candidates? Find them a job and a home. And please, pick them up. Yes. Six of them? Welcome to Uobuka Mr. Fukumoto. These two gentlemen are your friends? Where did you come from today? I came with the Shinkansen. From where? Very far. Is it your first time here? It's a good place. Nice people, excellent fish. Fish? I can't eat fish. Sorry. You want a drink? I have to drive but you can drink. Here you are. Miso ramen and bean noodles. Fried rice and fried dumplings. Thank you. Excuse me. It's a good place. Nice people, excellent fish. My clothes smell musty, they were in a locker for so long. You can buy something here, I'm sure. Thanks for waiting. Let's go then. Alright. Uobuka station. (A bright, beautiful and lively city) Welcome to Uobuka, Miss Kurimoto. Shutting. I'm storing the vacuum cleaner there. Goodbye. Is it there? It's a good place. Nice people and excellent fish. Who are you? I am from Uobuka City Office... Mr. Ohno, it's been a while. The boss is waiting for you. I don't have anything to do with you. Don't be disrespectful, I could get mad. Wait. At your age, you think you can take me? You refuse our help... don't come crying later. These guys just came out of jail. Right. You're so casual, you could have told me. I wanted you to offer you an unprejudiced first impression. The eyes of the government are on Uobuka. What do you mean? You've heard of rehabilitation. Sure. Jails are expensive for the tax payers. So they idea is to get quiet criminals back into society. It saves money. But there is a problem. If they don't have any close one to help them back... they can't benefit from this program. So this time the government has decided... to provide housing and employment in the local communities. This also shortens considerably their sentence. And so, we took up that task. Until now criminals were released with a quite short probation period. But this new program compels them to settle here for ten years. So, they will have to become citizens in Uobuka for 10 years. It is a new parole system. And for us it is a means to repopulate. This innovative program is a win-win. Do we disclose that to their employer and their landlord? You can guess. As ex-criminals they have a right of record confidentiality. You mean, only you and me will know? Yes, we are directly assigned by the mayor. What crimes did they commit? Any murderers among them? I understand your curiosity. Don't you think we should think positively and look to the future? It's a nice place. Nice people and excellent fish. Ten years, I don't know if I can bear it. Buy me a pack of smokes, Seven-Stars. Seven-Stars. Please, buy them yourself. If I had to go, I'd buy it for you... but I just went. I don't need to go. You don't need to go? I told you I don't. My bad. It's a nice place. I bet the fish is excellent. It's a nice place. Nice people and excellent fish. What is this? It's filefish I think. Filefish. Delicious. Mr. Miyakoshi? I missed soda. Sure. You enjoyed the sashimi, right? As good as you said it would be. You bet. And the kindness. Yes, people are easygoing. No, I mean you. Me? You've been kind to me knowing who I am. You don't fear me? Well, that is… You and me are humans. Do you know what I was sentenced for? I don't. I killed someone in the street. We quarreled I tried to run, but he was relentless. We had a fight. Well, I hit him just once. But he died as a result. I gave him a lethal blow. I was found guilty involuntary manslaughter. Sorry to bother you with that. Why did you want to tell me? Why… I do not know myself. Where have you been? What? You're not often at your desk lately. Really? You're preparing for the festival? We don't have enough participants. The population is aging. We can't just let it happen... we have to do something. You think so? We should send out notice everywhere. Everywhere? You did well. What's next? None of them have been told about the other five. Keep them away from each other. But how? This is such a small town. Who will take responsibility if they commit a crime? That contradicts what you said before. Anyway, if they associate... it defeats the purpose... it's not good for them and for Uobuka. Did you notify the police? No. For everybody they have to be regular citizens. Hey, Aya. You're visiting us. Not exactly, I moved back. You're registering your residence with your new husband? Who told you about that? I wasn't married. Really? You were working in a hospital in Chiba, right? I left. What happened? I saw you the other day. Where? At the airport with a very sexy woman Your girlfriend? What? You got it all wrong. See you. You're registering your residence? -Yes I need to see an ID, please. Are you still playing the guitar? The guitar? I am a parent representative at my daughter's kindergarten. But my wife says I don't have time for a rock band. Aya is divorced? Apparently, they were not married. She told me. You're still into her? What a waste... You had a good salary there. Not really. You didn't have to quit, you could take a long leave. How's your daughter? How old is she? She's six. If you had to come back you should have brought us a young doctor. Young doctors are really young, nowadays. Then you should have taken that rich geezer. You were going out with an old man? You were cheating? Stop the nonsense. It's fine. So, you were cheating. You've certainly aged. You bet, in the countryside we age two years in a year. Right? I your case rather four years. Alright. Good morning, thank you. Take the tools first. What happened? A murder. Excuse me. Please don't take pictures. Don't take pictures. Good Morning. We haven't had a murder in Uobuka in years. We don't know if it's a murder. It's an unnatural death. We'll see after the autopsy. The victim is a fisherman from Higashimachi. Do you suspect our six candidates? How do you know? How do you know that? Sending you to pick up those six was really odd. I peeked into the boss's computer. You know that's a crime. Compared to those six, I'm an angel. You mean, you know what they were inside for? What? He didn't tell you? For murder. Which one? The six of them. That Fukumoto, the barber... his boss was picking on him... one night he drank and he did him. He cut his throat with a razor. What, he did him? He killed him? Ohno is a yakuza. He strangled a rival boss with a wire. Incredible, just like in the movies. Thank you, goodbye. -Goodbye. Don't tighten like that, we'll have to undo it. Use your brain. And then... -Enough of that. What? How about that one you saw at the pier... His name? Sugiyama. -Right he's the one you're interested in. The body on the pier had marks of violence. So... If anyone witnessed a violent scene here, on October 23, 5:30 pm to 8:30 pm, please report to the police. What's up? I'm just passing by. Just passing by? You know my crime, right? I don't know. Aggravated assault. Have you heard of the Ikebukuro Gold China incident? Involuntary man slaughter, I took 8 years. Do you like taking photos? I was in the photo club in jail. They have clubs there? See you. I didn't do it. Nororo, Nororo... Hey kid, what is Nororo? A monster. A spirit. You can't look him in the eyes. Nororo. Nororo. Nororo. Nororo. Miss Ota, can you help? OK. 'Sunrise' dry cleaner. Hello. Excuse me? Yes. Welcome. -Hello. You should greet the incoming guests. Sorry. What do you want now? Is he new? A request from the City. I had no choice. It's me. What? I bought you nuggets. Did you change the miso? I took the diet one. Yuk. There's a new person at the care center, right? Who? They change all the time. Our office placed her there, Miss Ota. Miss Ota? Maybe she's a bit strange, you'll tell me what you think. Why? If there was anything, report to me first. -Like what? Well, anything. What is it? I heard you as I drove by. You heard us from that far? Are you playing rock? Something like that. Could I watch you guys? How about your job? A friend? Mr. Miyakoshi, recently moved here. Amamori - Hair Salon Ouch. Sorry. I feel fresh. Thank you very much. Where did you learn to shave? Hello. -Welcome It's been a while. -Please. Did you see the game yesterday? Too bad they didn't have more time. 1-1 what a shame. Miss Kurimoto. I appreciate your thoroughness... but you need to speed up a bit. Good evening, Mr. Tsukisue. I suspect he knows about me. Where's Mr. Amamori? He's out, he'll be back soon. Mr. Tsukisue? Welcome, you need a cut? He said he wanted a shave. I'm glad you came, we need to talk. It's great that I can go out a while and keep the shop open. Yes. No, I'm talking to Mr. Tsukisue. Yes. Don't talk either Mr. Tsukisue, he could cut you. I was always alone here. I thought it would never change. Yes. You don't need to talk. And so… This is last week's. I'm not getting any younger. But I'm still a good judge of character. Mr. Tsukisue. Fukumoto passed his barber's license in a jail. Mr. Fukumoto. Mr. Fukumoto. I should have told you. I feared you'd reject him... Mr. Fukumoto would have nowhere to go. I bear the entire resp... It's not like that, Mr. Tsukisue. In fact, I did some time too. What? More than twenty years ago. I also took my license in jail. I know very well how hard rehabilitation is. You just said it, he's afraid he'd have nowhere to go. That's right. That's what matters, he needs a place to be. I'm very grateful that he came here. Don't cry. I shouldn't do this. Why? Dragon Head Ramen Hey. They ceased business? Quite a while ago. I see. You used to like it, Aya. What was it? The 'Hell Hot ramen' the red one. I sure had a lot of that one. That ramen place on the 8th has a good reputation. Bye. Will you come to the festival? Nororo? I don't think I will. There was always something creepy about it. That's an expensive one.. Not that much. You play with us? No, I can't. Electric guitar for beginners. Let's get started. You got it all wrong. This finger comes here. There. Right. Thank you guys. Good evening. So? Well our Nororo is eaten up by mold. Probably the moist wind by the shore. Probably. You didn't mind? What? As kids, we were told not to look at him. Mr. Tsukisue, are you serious? Ah, right, it was a brain stroke. Who? The death on the pier was not a murder. Really? The autopsy revealed it. He had a stroke and fell in the water. The fall caused his bruises and wounds. I see. Are you relieved? Kind of. Why are you so concerned ? I'm not. Here you are again. Well, it's a small town. Put it here. Are you practicing the guitar? Look. Calluses. I am looking forward to tomorrow's festival. It’s better not to look at it. Yes, I heard that. Nororo is a fish, right? Well, it's rather an evil spirit who came from the sea. He's not a patron spirit then? Yes he became a patron after the villagers defeated him. The legend says that he was thrown from this cliff. You heard about the human sacrifices? People were sacrificed to him. Two persons during the festival had to jump. One of them would be saved... but the other one disappeared. Huh? You'll do that tomorrow? Of course not, that was in the old times. Maybe it should be you and me. Hey, I can't swim. Put it over there. Excuse me. Quick, hold it. Catch the bamboo sticks. Nororo Festival Reception You want me to go? OK, call if there's anything new. What happened? The wind blew away some bamboo sticks. They seem OK but I don't like it. And the participants? Sure, I'm taking care of it. Mr. Sugiyama. He asked me for help, hope you don't mind? Sure. Thank you. You can change clothes there. You should have told me. Don't worry. Today they all become real Uobuka residents. All? Hajime. Aunt Taikomo, hello. Thank you. Here. Beer? No thanks. Just one drink for the occasion. But… saké is sacred it purifies your soul. And it's important to blend in. Another one? How about a girlfriend? A civil servants who can't get a girlfriend? This is Miss Kurimoto, she just moved in. Do you want a drink? At least enjoy the food. Please, eat something. What do you want? Ouch. Stop it now. Hey, Fukumoto. Tashiro. What? Let go. Hey. What? It hurts… Miss Kurimoto. Miss Kurimoto. Are you OK? I'm scared. Mr. Fukumoto is usually very nice... I am scared of myself... It's because I am... I am scary. She has bad memories. Her boyfriend was a violent drunk. He was beating her. And one day... in his sleep she bashed his head with a bottle. Come. Lord Nororo will be here soon. It is a tradition to avoid looking directly at him. We ask you to enter your homes. And please do not peek from windows. Lord Nororo is arriving. Nororo. Nororo. Nororo. Nororo. Nororo. Nororo. Nororo. Nororo. Nororo. Nororo. Who are you? Nororo. Nororo. Nororo. Nororo. Nororo. Nororo. Nororo. Nororo. Nororo. Nororo. We're not supposed to look at Nororo. Why? It's an old tradition. That's why everybody has to do it. He'll be here soon, let's get inside. OK. Don't, Nororo is coming. No. Nororo. Nororo. Wait. Stop! It's postponed. Lord Nororo, is he angry? How are you going to rehabilitate your foot? At your age you should give up women. But I love her. Come on, you've been punished enough. Sorry, Auntie. Come here. He says he loves her. -Uh? That woman who just moved here. He's even considering to marry her. It’s ridiculous. What do you think? -What? Considering his health, of course he could use her care. But for you it could be worrisome. Talk it over with that lady. Right. Do you love my father? Yes. And he loves me too. You told him about your past? No. You think I should? I guess. If we plan to get married? What was your crime? I killed... my husband. I strangled him. Why? Was he terminally ill? It's not that. During sex... he was aroused when strangled... suffocation was his source of pleasure. But I was scared. I love him so much, I couldn't refuse. Even that day... I was confused, was I scared or was I enjoying it? I tightened too hard... when I realized... But the judge didn't believe me. I had no intention to kill him. I loved him. Truly. You love someone and you end up killing him... most people won't get that. Please stay away from my father for now. Mr. Tsukisue. You think I shouldn't love anymore? Am I forbidden until I die? Mr. Tsukisue. Look, it's on the national news. Our Nororo Festival makes the news. Ouch. Look at you "The right person in the right place", as they say. Let's do it. What? The only thing we're good at. You're just like me. What? Until I realized I was a fool. But it was too late. I know I'm a fool. Still I'm smarter than a yakuza. You don't have to keep cleaning that spot. The clients aren't coming? Because of you. It's because of you, but you it's not your fault. What was that scene at the festival? You were quiet but... you helped with that drunk and got hurt. But you managed to scare people. They say you have a yakuza scar, that's so rude. People's first impression is often right. Uh? I was a killer for the yakuza. I did 8 years of jail. I came straight here... from jail. You lied to me? In that case... I can't keep you. Thank you for your care. I'll report to Mr. Tsukisue at the city's office... and ask him to help you find a replacement. Please, listen... How about my first impression? I never saw you as a bad person. Excuse me. -Yes, hello. The newspaper said I should ask here. Hello. You are looking for someone? This person. On this photo? May I? Director, the gentleman is looking for this person. You mean this man? Yes. Why are you looking for him? He looks like someone who took care of my son. I had a chance to contact him, I'm only checking. I'm very sorry. You know about the Privacy Protection Law. We can't disclose this information. Damn. Where did you do your time? My jail foreman was nasty. He was shouting at random. If I jumped he'd tell me, "you're a sissy". And he'd punished me Don't they prohibit talking during work there? Then let's have that talk with a drink. A talk? We'll be ten years here, ten years. Let's make the best of it. What do you mean by that? Me, I'm bored to death. Me, I'm not. It's a nice place, here. Goodbye. It's not a goodbye. The tree branches will raise it's soul to heaven. Let's play. We'd better stop the band. Why? Your dad told me how busy you are. But we just started. Look, you're wasting your time. Wasting my time? Aya and Miyakoshi are dating. Just look at them. How do you know? I asked Aya. Try it again. There. 3, 2... One more time. Thank you. Can I walk you home? I'd rather ride my bike. It's OK. Thank you. Have you seen this man? Excuse me, have you seen this man? I don't think so. Excuse me... Have you seen this man, here? Excuse me. Is this where the Nororo Festival is held? Yes. Have you seen this man? This man. Sorry. It's you on the photo here, right? So? Do you know this man? What's your purpose? He took care of my son once. "Took care"? You have to thank him then. Tell me the truth. Don't worry, I know he just came out. Sudo is late. He quit the band. Why? Miyakoshi called, he'll be late because of his work. So he calls you? We're dating. You noticed, right? No, I didn't. OK. Well, it's official, we're dating. That was fast. What? You don't know anything about him. Is that how you talk about a friend? It's not against... What do you know about him? All these years, still you don't get me at all. I don't date someone I know... I date someone I can discover. Miyakoshi was in jail. Why? Because he killed someone It's not his fault... well, he's responsible. He had a fight in the street and unluckily he killed the guy. He payed his debt, right? Please don't tell it around. Then you shouldn't have told me. Hello? You finished the session? Sorry, I had so many deliveries today. Could we talk now? What's up? I'll tell you in person. I want to apologize. About what? I fought with Aya. And on an impulse, I told her about your past I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are you apologizing as a friend? Or as a city clerk? As a friend. Then it's fine. You forgot? Where did I see you? Meguro Takashi. I am his father. Meguro? Sorry, I don't unders... sorry, I couldn't play. Stop. What happened to you? I lost a button. Let's go. Shall I take your laundry? It's done. Miss Ota came? You forbid her, so she's in the lobby. She told me about everything. I haven't changed my mind about her. It's OK, sit down. Well... Yes. After that conversation with you, Hajime... You're using my first name? OK, fine. I made a sincere effort to deny my feelings for him. But the harder I tried, the more pain I felt in my heart. I love him even more now. All I think is, I'm longing to be with him. Your don't care about jail stories, right? Are you interested? In jail, we can't have a bath every day. And we can stay only 15 minutes at a time The toilet is in the corner of the cell. Even when we eat, it smells. These things, we get used to. What is harder to get used to is the crying. They often cry at night... because they miss a child or a husband. One of them starts and we all tune in... even inmates who have grudges against her. I can't stop when I love someone. I want to be with the person I love. So, I will never go back in jail. That's all I wanted to tell you, Hajime. It's ok. You can call me Hajime. I shouldn't have interfered. Since they arrived in town, I grew an interested in these guys. Look, I'm busy. Miyakoshi, for example, is a bit odd. Why? He got only a year and a half. Well if it's self-defense. -Nope. For self-defense he'd get a suspended sentence.... and probation time. What? Well, he's not a first offender. Miyakoshi has a record? -Nope. Then, all is fine. But as a minor it's different... juvenile delinquency doesn't make it into the record. So it would be juvenile detention... since the judge knew it, his sentence wasn't suspended. But that is just your guess. Well, someone was looking for him. I saw you kill that Meguro. Where's the body? In the sea I bet. That's not clever, it will pop up. Poor old dude... waiting for 15 years to avenge his son... he ends up feeding the fish. How many did you kill? How many people so far? I knew guys like you who kill without a blink. Like they kill a roach. Do you want money? If I said yes, you'd kill me? You'd kill me. On a boat I'm sure I can take you. I'm kidding. I told you I want to work with you. Smuggling drugs across the sea. This town doesn't have yakuza. Don't try anything fancy on me. I took my precautions. Yes? Sorry about yesterday. Are you with Miyakoshi now? No? Is it about him? No. We should talk. You finished work? I can go there. No, I'll go at your place. I'm leaving the office now. Alright. Good evening. What happened? Let's play. Let me show you. It's an F chord. Press your fingers tight. You can play too? A little. You like the bass better. Not really... Aya insisted on being the guitar. In high school? Yes. A happy youth... I feel like I was in class with you guys. Sorry, I'm exhausted today. It's OK. I thought you may be in love with Aya. Eh? So, I'm right. I didn't know. Had I known, I'd have refrained. But we broke up. Miyakoshi. Goodness, I'm so exhausted. Were you in jail for the first time? Yes, I was. How about Juvy? About that... Are you asking as a friend? Yes. Yes. What was your crime? Miyakoshi. Miyakoshi? You were asleep, I tried to be quiet. I'm too old to ever get good at it. Of course not, I will teach you. How about a boat trip? Eh? Now? No? He's holding something. It's a button, take pictures. Where did you get that? I bought it. Tsukisue? Tsukisue? You're not picking up? Could be Aya. Hello? We're heading to the cliff, you should join us. To the cliff? It's the best view on the sea. You can't see from there. What are you doing? We should jump together. And see which of us two survives. What do you mean? Since I'm a murderer. But it's in the past, right? I'm sorry. I am still a murderer. Yesterday and the day before... maybe tonight again. I know you can't forgive me. But that's the way I am. One of us has to disappear. What? Let's leave the decision to Lord Nororo. What? I bet you'll win anyway. Emergency call, car number 41 Toyama... Looking for a delivery van, yellow with a blue stripe. Let's go to the police. You can confess and start over. I'll wait for you. You don't get it. It's the death row for me. It's hopeless. What do you mean hopeless? You're angry? We are friends. Why such desperate act? You don't consider me your friend? It was reported by the city office. That's the delivery van. Tsukisue. Tsukisue. Tsukisue. Tsukisue. It's amazing. Come, stand here. Look this way. Look here, smile... are you smiling? Smile. Smile. Only the lower part moves, only your thumb moves. All the way. Ramen. -Uh?
