[Jim] Good morning, Los Angeles. It's 6:30 a.m. on a beautiful Tuesday, and, Becky, you know what that means. [Becky] I sure do, Jim. It's lottery madness! Tonight's lotto jackpot is $82 million. Eighty-two million! I couldn't get into my liquor store because the line... [moaning] [sighing] [meowing] Good morning, Fred. You want some breakfast? Yeah? [meowing] There you go. Okay, hang in there, old-timer. [phone ringing] There. Oh. Hey there, Miss Ashlee. Uh, yeah, I can get you at karate. You want Mexican or sushi? Okay, you got it. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I need to talk to your mom. Okay. Uh, hey, Lisa. I wanted to let you know that I booked the Tiki Room for Friday. I know that it's fancy, but she only turns 13 once. It's my treat. No, I want to do it. No, I am not trying to make you look bad. I... Okay, fine. I don't want to argue with you. I'll see you tonight. Okay? Bye. [exhales] Okay, Fred. [clicks tongue] Come here. I am not going to let her bother me today. Not today. Hey. Can you call them? Sure. Ronnie. Hey, Paul. I thought I was gonna beat you in. Julie, can we have that meeting in about ten minutes? [Julie]Sure. Ay-yi-yi. [sighs] Hey. Hey. How was your weekend? Meet any fabulous, smart and sexy men? Well, I took a spin class and hung out with my cat. That's pretty sexy. Whatever. Oh. And congratulations on being our top earner. Again. Thank you. Hello. I'm here to see Karen Donovan. My name is James Cooper. Hold on a second. James! There you are. [laughs, shrieks] Good to see you, girl! Whoa! Wow, you look fantastic. Where's the other half of you? Ah. Wife has me on some Palm Beach diet. This is stunning. All Judy. I had nothing to do with it. [laughing] Sorry she couldn't come. When we got the phone call that my daughter was in labor, she was on the next plane back to Tucson. I understand that. When my niece was born, you couldn't keep me away. Wow. Well, now that, that is my room. Dad must have loved this. Well, not much impressed your old man, but this sure did. He ever take you shooting? Oh, yeah, sure, when I was a kid. You know, a long, long time ago. Now, see this? This was one of his favorites. Belonged to William F. Cody. Buffalo Bill? You're kidding. Beautiful house. Thanks. And you picked the perfect time to sell. [karate master] Keep those hands up, Ashlee. There you go. In and out. In and out. Move, move. Good. Keep moving. Keep moving. [karate master muttering] [groaning] [karate master] In and out! That's all you got? Let's go. Keep going. In and out. In and out. Hi-yah! [grunting] Good. Nice block. Time! Time! Time! [groaning] Ashlee, time! [giggling] The look on your face. Classic. Bow. I was just messing with you. All right, class dismissed. Hey, Aunt Karen. Hey. What? I think we need to look up the word "fair." Go on. Apologize. I did. All right, missy. He's cute, right? You know, there are better ways to show a boy you like him. Go get dressed. Okay, I got thirty. What number do you want? Seven. Okay. There we go. We'll hand this in after dinner, okay? You? You wanna go have some dinner? Go ahead. So, hmm, what were we talking about? Oh, yes, this. I talked to your mom. Guess you're interested in going to a high school party? Knew this was coming. What's Mom so freaked out about? Mm, you're 12. Need I say more? Things are different now, Aunt Karen. Kids are much more sophisticated. Really? Okay. Yeah. Mm-hmm. Well, this is how I see it going down. Okay, you go to this party with your really good-looking friends, and you're looking good and feeling good, and you're making the moves and doing the dance, and you get to the party, and this guy named Travis or Lucas or... it's always a guy with a really cool name... hands you a beer. This beer is the grossest, cheapest beer in the whole world. Really. It tastes like pee! But you drink it anyway, and you're like, "Mm. Beer." And then you go, "I'm feeling good, so I'm gonna have myself another beer." You have another beer, and now you're feeling smart and deep and you can't shut up, and you're like, "Megan, you're my best friend in the whole wide world. LaToya, let's raise our children together." [chuckles] Definitely a strange one, but that's why I love you. I love you, too. No high school parties. Not until you're 50. Fifty-four. I'll be the old one at the party. We're late. Your mom's gonna kill me. Go! [Karen laughs] ♪♪ [car stereo] Um, Lisa... I'm gonna buy a horse with my winnings. Lisa, I will have her home in 20 minutes. Relax. Goodbye. What are you gonna buy first? What am I going to buy? I'm going to buy a new horse, of course. ♪♪ [car stereo] [giggling] Come on. Come on. Good luck. Hey, Joe. Sorry we're late. Oh, no problem. Just under the wire, honey. Can I have some ice cream? Where do you put it all? I'm a kid. Go. Please have your numbers ready. Only six minutes to go. That's right. You know this store has already sold two winning tickets this year. She's right. This store is lucky. That's all I'm saying. Nobody move! Eyes on the ground! Let's see 'em! Come on! I don't want to see your eyes! Let's go! Open the safe. The key's in the register. I know it's there. Wallets and purses! Look down! Don't do anything stupid! Look at your shoes. I don't want to see your face! Come on! Hurry up! Hey, give me that ring! It's my mother's ring! Give me the damn ring! Hurry up, lady! Look down! Look down! Give me the damn ring! Hurry up! Let's go! Hurry up! Give me the damn ring! I'm trying! Look down! Look down! Watch out, Bobby! [screaming] Ashlee! Ashlee! [screams] No! Get down! Ashlee! [muffled shouting] No! No! Ashlee! Go! Go! Let's go! Just drive, just drive! No, no, no, no! Man, what in the hell! Just drive, just drive! [grunting] Goddamn it! Stop it! Don't look at me! You gotta get rid of her, Bobby! No! Stop it! Stop it! Bobby, we can't stop! Please! [panting] Ashlee! Ashlee! Help me! Ashlee, honey! Help me! [sobbing] Ashlee! [crying] [police radio chatter] [Frank] What you doing? Lock it up out here! You ever been on a crime scene before? Hey, Frank! Over here. Do the three-sixties yet? Yeah, sure. Hey, I wanna talk to everybody here. Any word on the little girl that was kidnapped? Not yet. You check with the office? You check for similars? I wanna see if there's a connection between the perp and the little girl. I'm on it. I need a list of everybody that's ever worked here and delivery services as well. You got it, Frank. Now. I'm so sorry for your loss. If you can, I need to ask you just a few questions. Excuse me just a moment. What do you have? Equipment's old. The tape's badly degraded. It's gonna take a lot of work before we can get anything usable. [sobbing] [sighs] Swear this takes five years off my life every time I do it. I'm Detective Newman. You mind if I ask you a few questions? [sobbing] What was he thinking? Stupid, stupid! Does the name "Bobby" ring a bell? A previous employee? No. Maybe you noticed someone unusual the last few days? Maybe someone in the parking lot that just didn't sit right? No. Nothing. Nothing. [phone ringing] [crying] [phone ringing] [sighs] I'm sorry. Excuse me. Yeah. We're gonna do everything we can. I promise. Thank you. All right, I'll be there as soon as I can. [sighs] I'm gonna head out to the hospital, see if I can catch the woman that chased these guys. Right. [coughing] [coughing] [crying] Don't die! Excuse me! Excuse me! You. No one's telling me anything about my niece. Uh, well... Say something! Karen? Karen, where is she? Is she okay? They're not saying anything. Is she gonna die? How could you let this happen? Lisa! Lisa! Lisa, it's all right. It's all right, baby. Everything's all right. She'll be okay. It's okay. Mrs. Simmons? You the mother? Yeah. Is my daughter all right? She sustained a massive blow to the back of her head. We're running some tests to figure out what we're up against here. She'll be okay? We'll know more in the next 24 hours. Can I see her? She's not conscious. Yes, briefly. Lisa... Go home, Karen. You've done enough. I can't believe this is happening. What happened to you? [Karen] I'm fine. You wanna sit down? No! She's just upset. Don't take this personally. You didn't do anything wrong. This is not your fault. I'm gonna check her in, okay? And then we'll go upstairs. Mrs. Donovan? Hi, I'm Detective Frank Newman. Sorry to hear about your niece. She's gonna be okay? The doctors don't know yet. And how are you doing? I'm fine. Is it possible you can show me where Ashlee was thrown from the car? Yeah, of course. What's happening? This is Detective... Frank Newman, ma'am. He needs me to show him where Ashlee got hurt. Can you just tell Lisa where I am? Of course. This isn't your fault. Go. Appreciate you answering all those questions. No problem. Glad I could be of help. Thank you. Yeah? No abandoned black or navy vehicle so far. All right. Well, keep looking. Anything? No, not yet, but usually they drop the car within a three-mile radius of the crime scene. You sure you didn't get any piece of the license plate? No, I should have, but I was too focused in on Ashlee. I know the customers, though. I could ask around and... No, we'll take care of that. How is Ashlee? She's in surgery. Lisa says she will call me if anything changes. That's her way of telling me that I should go home. I don't know how that's gonna happen. I left my car at the hospital, so... Uh, Jim? Yeah, Frank, go ahead. Uh, never mind. I can take you. Come on. [Frank] Is there anything you can tell me about your sister's friends? I mean, the type of group. People that she hangs out with, what they're like. I'm all thumbs. Maybe there's something from her past that... I have to feed my cat. [meowing] Here, Fred. Uh... Okay. Here you go. My hands won't stop shaking. Here, here, let me... let me do that. You can't let them get away with this. I won't. Is there someone I can call? A Mr. Donovan? I'm divorced. I see. Um... Listen, Mrs. Donovan... Karen. Karen... you're gonna go over this a hundred times in your head, trying to figure out what you could have done differently. I know. I've been through something like this before. In high school, I witnessed a murder. Friend? My brother. I see. And did the cops... No. They never solved the case. That's why my mom... Hates cops. That makes sense. You have to remember that you're not responsible for this, they are. Then why do I feel like I am? You're trying to make sense of it. It's what victims do. The only way to feel safe is to feel in control. That's gonna make you feel better? One pill in his dish. He's got arthritis. I take cases like this very seriously. Do you really? I do. Do you have children? I have a son. If anybody hurt him, I wouldn't stop until I found them. Well, Ashlee's like my daughter. Just keep me informed. Try and get some rest. [Fred meowing] Here you go, Fred. [laughing] That's why I love you. I love you, too. [gunfire] [screaming] [shouting] Watch out, Bobby! Help me! [robbers shouting] Somebody help me! [gasps] [heartbeats] Sorry I missed your game last night. It's okay, Dad. All right. So, your mom will pick you up after school, okay? Okay. What's up? Well, is there still a chance that you and Mom might get back together? Uh, well, uh, it's been six months. Um... You know, it's complicated. [sighs] See ya. Love ya. Hey. Ray Martinez. I knew something got my attention that night, and it wasn't the music. It was something that I saw. I saw the driver of the car. That's him. You're sure? You said I'd go over it a hundred times, and I did. And I just... I saw him so clearly. It's a bit of a coincidence, don't you think? You sure this isn't emotion or memories from, uh... from when your brother... No. I saw him. Excuse me a minute, Karen. Tom. How's it going? The tape's at the lab, but don't count on it. There was a robbery in the Valley last month with a similar M.O. I'm checking it out. Miss Pitt went through all the books? Yeah. She didn't recognize anyone. Thanks. Okay, uh, let's see. Raymond... Uh, well, he's got a couple DUIs and a misdemeanor. No criminal record. It was him! Okay. This is where we'll start, then. Okay. Bit of a long shot, don't you think? We are in the long shot business. Uh, no, we're not. Not usually. How you doing? Looking for a Ray Martinez. He's busy. What do you want? Just say I got a personal interest in him. He's in the back. Ray Martinez? You better be from the state lottery. Why? You need the money? We need to talk. [monitor beeping] [beeping continues] If the cops aren't gonna do anything, I will! Stop it, George. I can't let 'em get away with it! George, what are you going to do, huh? You don't even know for sure who it was. What if you're wrong? What if you're wrong? Somebody needs to pay for this! Don't. [beeping continues] Hey. You're not gonna believe what I did this morning. I went in her bedroom to get her up for school. I'd forgotten she was here. Can I get you anything? Did you get ahold of Eddie? Yeah. He wants us to move back to his hometown. Stay with his parents till he gets back from Afghanistan. Can you imagine me on a farm? You're not going anywhere. I don't know. He has a right to protect his kid. They got the driver of the car. They arrested him. Ashlee's gonna be just fine. I promise. She's gonna walk out of here, and the men that did this to her, they're going to jail. They're not gonna get away with this. And you... Look at me. You're not... gonna milk cows in Wyoming. In Nebraska. Same difference. Oh, God, I haven't been here since... [Frank] Hey, I thought we had a meeting. We got the walk down. Why didn't you file? You've got a woman who hasn't seen this man in 20 years. I've got a boss who said he was working. If you file, I will get this scum to roll over on the others. You're always putting the cart before the horse, Newman. No, I'm not gonna let you screw this up like you did the little Jefferson girl. I gave you enough to put Tibbs away for life, and you know it. Not according to the jury. Are we done? You have a good day. I can't wait for you to read all your cards yourself. People you don't even know are praying for you. Karen? Can we talk a moment? Excuse me, Detective. This is disrespectful. The D.A. won't file charges. We had to let Ray go. What? I don't believe this. They're letting Ray go. He claims that he was at work that night, and his boss confirmed it. I thought you said he was the one. He... Mom, he was. He is. Listen, we found his black car. I have my guys going over every inch of it as we speak. What about Ray? At this point, there's nothing we can do. I can't deal with this. Not again. You know the boss is lying, right? I'm sorry. There's nothing I can do about Ray. This isn't over, Karen. [sighs] [gunshot] [screaming] [shouting] [car horn honking] I'm checking in to see Ashlee Simmons. I'm her aunt. Blue Team, ICU. She's still in ICU 143. Come on! Let's go, let's go! Blue Team to ICU. Get the mask on her. Here, hold her arm down. Damn it. Stat, acetylcholine. What's happening? Ashlee! Ashlee! Help her! Ma'am, I need... I am. You need to step into the hallway now. Hold her arm straight for me. [monitor beeping rapidly] Lisa! Oh, my God, what's going on? What's happening to her? Hold her down. What's happening? It's okay. She's family. I'm here to see Detective Frank Newman. Tell me that you have something. Anything. We showed Ray's picture to every witness, and nobody recognizes him. I'm sorry. We're hoping the video surveillance can help us more. My family is barely hanging on here. What happened? Ashlee had a seizure. Even if she wakes up, she might not be the same, ever. I'm sorry. When you said that you took cases like this personally, was that just a line that you used to get me to back off... to get me to trust you? I can't force a confession. I'm following the procedure, but you have to give me time. I need some time, Karen. I have to go. You just have to give me... [Karen on phone] Hello, James? I need your help. [James on phone] What is it? Can you meet me tonight? [James] I'm just saying it's dangerous. I have to at least try to find something that the police can use. What if you get hurt? It's worth the risk. My dad ever tell you about my brother Danny? Is that what this is about? There was a party, and this guy started getting rough with me. Danny, of course, stepped in, and there was a fight, and... [girls screaming] [screaming] We were leaving the party and... a car drove by and... my brother was shot. [screaming] He died three days later. Everyone knew who did it. They just couldn't prove it. George must have wanted to track them down. He never did a thing, and that haunted him for the rest of his life. Ray needs to be held accountable for what he did. My family has hurt enough. Please. This should make you feel safer. Do you remember how to use it? Of course I do. Be careful. You need anything, call me. Yes, customer service. I am doing a title search. I need an address for a Raymond Martinez. Eagle Rock. [Karen's voice] Testing... testing... [knocking] Hi. I'm from Madison High School Reunion Committee. Madison High School? That's right. I'm looking for graduates. Didn't graduate. Oh. Um... you're... Raymond Martinez, right? Maybe. I'm in a bind. I'm looking for alumni. We're gathering phone numbers together. Do you keep in touch with anyone? You were a skirt, right? A cheerleader. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I remember you. [Karen chuckles] Come on in. Thanks. So, do you still keep in contact with, um, Bobby? Isn't that his name? No. Nah. Nah. I didn't hang with a Bobby. Oh, that's weird. I thought you did. Want a beer? Sure. [both chuckling] So, uh, Ray, you live here alone? Yeah. I got some wine. Yeah, that sounds good. So, uh, what have you been doing all these years, you know, what, what kind of business are you in? You know, you didn't pay much attention to me in high school. Wait. Your brother played ball. Right? The one that got killed. You're Karen, right? Yeah, that's me. Yeah. Drop the phone. Drop the phone! I'm dropping the phone. What do you want? I want you to admit that you were the driver of the car, and I want the names of the other two men that robbed the store. Lady, you're out of your mind. I saw you, Ray, but there must have been someone else, someone I didn't see. I'm telling you... The names! Marvin Nichols. He was the lookout. Come on, Karen. Don't do this. You're an idiot. You're going to jail. When Ashlee wakes up, she's going to I.D. all of you. No, no, no, no, see? You don't know what world you just stepped into. I make one call, Ashlee's dead. What did you say? You're in way over your head. See, if you hurt me, Ashlee's finished. You're not gonna tell nobody nothing. Hmm? [gasps] Now, give me that gun. Now! [screams] [door closing] [Ray's voice] You don't know what world you just stepped into. I make one call... I make one call, Ashlee's dead. You're in way over your head. [police radio chatter] Neighbor head the gunshot, but didn't bother calling it in. Nice neighbors. Now, the girlfriend came home from work and found him like this. But she's pretty sure that nothing's been taken. The shooter was a familiar face. She stood about here. She? She. Did you take a look at the fridge? It's full of beer. Think if you had one of the guys over you'd offer him wine? Huh. What was the girlfriend's name again? I didn't do anything wrong! Screw you! Screw all cops! Boy, she doesn't look happy. She's not. Come on in. What's this about? Ray Martinez. What else can you tell me about Ray Martinez? Just what I've told you. Football player. I think he got kicked off the team. You ever been to his house? No. Why? Ray was shot dead at his home last night. Where were you last night between 7:00 and 10:00? Am I a suspect? It's just procedure. I was with a client. James Cooper. You want his number? [phone ringing] I gotta get that. Tell you what. Why don't you e-mail me your client's number, and I'll keep you posted. Thank you. Detective Newman. Walter. What can I do for you? [woman over P.A.] Dr. Morris, dial 118, please. Dr. Morris, please dial 1-1-8. Oh, damn it! That's all right. It's all right, honey. It's just water. It's okay. Calm down, sweetie. I got it. That's why I always bring a lot of napkins. Mom? Hmm. Mom, I did something really bad, and I'm not sure how to handle... I'll just get rid of this. What is it? What is it, honey? It's nothing. I have to go. Wait a minute. What's... I'm fine. What's wrong? It's okay, Mom. Don't worry. It's fine. I'm handling it. I know you're having a hard time right now because of what happened with your brother. And going through all of this now, it's just... I'm so sorry that I wasn't there for you then. I'm okay. You were so young. And I was having such a hard time with your father and... Losing a child is just... Losing a child is... Nothing's the same afterwards. A piece of you is missing. And I'm so scared that your sister is going to be facing the same thing. Ashlee's gonna be fine. I have to go. Call me if there's any changes. Of course. Of course. Do you want your sandwich? Excuse me. Can I help you? I... I hope so. Um... I'm looking for Marvin Nichols. I... He left this at my house last night. Do you know where I can find him? He left that at your house last night? Yeah. There's a place he goes to a few blocks from here. Gary's, it's called. Oh, Gary's Bar? Yeah. He goes for happy hour about 5:00. Can I get you something? You seem like a martini kind of gal. Maybe you can help me out. I'm looking for a Marvin Nichols. Yo, Gary! Cuba Libre. Heavy on the Libre. Ah. That's too bad. I was gonna buy you a drink. Really? Well, maybe you can buy me my second drink. Sounds like a deal. Haven't seen you around here before. Well, that's funny, because I haven't see you around here before. Hey... Ah, ah, ah. I got this. Will you open a tab, please? I'm not usually this forward, but I had my chart done today, and my chart said that I was gonna meet someone very special. When you walked through that door, I knew that someone special was you. [laughs] Do you, uh... believe in stuff like that? No. Mm-mm? Well, that's funny, because your aura is very, very intense and passionate. Oh, yeah? Mm-hmm. [chuckles] Well, uh, you know, sometimes I get this vibe. I can see things before they happen. Me, too. Do you? Mm-hmm. Yeah? Wanna get out of here? Yeah. [giggles] Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa. What? You know what? I can, uh, get the blanket out of my truck, and then we can do it under the stars. Oh, yeah. Oh, God! [laughs] When I was about 11 years old, I popped my cherry in a van on the other side of that building. [laughs] Whoo! God, she was a homely chick. I was in love. What do you think? How about over here? [gun cocks] What are you doing? I want the names of the other men that were in the car when you robbed that store! Then I'm calling the police. What are you talking about? Such a waste of time, Marvin. How do you think I found you? Ray told me that you were the lookout inside the store! You... Ray? Yeah. You and Ray are going to prison! But first, I want to know those names. [screaming] [screams] [thud] Our body's name is Marvin Nichols. Is the body at the morgue? It's in transit. With all the ground to cover out here, it's gonna be a while before we find any evidence. Give me the tape of the convenience store right away, will ya? Yeah. What time did you get to bed? About 4:30. I'm tired. That is the first time in 20 years I've heard you use that word. What are you saying, Anderson? I'm getting old? Maybe. Here, old man. Take a load off. [laughs] Oh, geez! Well, they put it through noise reduction, cleaned up some of the bad frames. It's a better picture, not great. Hold it there. Please, everybody, have your numbers ready. Only six minutes to go. Keep going. Watch her take off. Will you look at her go? Ashlee! She is a badass! Marvin Nichols was the lookout. Freeze it. Hello, Marvin. [doorbell rings] Where were you Tuesday night? Come in. Tuesday night. Tuesday night. Movies. Movies. What movie? Ta-da! I highly recommend it. Seen it. Do you own a gun? What? I know you heard the question. No, I don't own a gun. My father had a collection, though. Used to bring my sister hunting every summer. I went once. I had nightmares for a week. Are you sure you don't want any wine? I need a refill. I'm good. What are you doing here, Detective? Did Ray tell you about Marvin Nichols? What? Who else did Ray tell you about? You know I never talked to Ray. I heard about Marvin Nichols on the news. That's quite a coincidence that two of our main suspects wound up dead the last couple of days, don't you think? Yeah, I do think. I guess someone's doing your job for you. Well, I certainly hope it wasn't you, Karen. I'll let myself out. [humming] Detective. Hope I'm not disturbing you, Mrs. Shaw. Actually, this is not a good time. I need to talk to you. Is it about Ashlee? It's about Karen. Come in. I, uh, also wanted to talk to you about your son. I read the file. I see they had a suspect, but the case never went to trial. I don't want to talk about that. What does this have to do with Karen? I think Karen's worried that the men that did this to Ashlee are going to get away with it. Poor Karen. I think she still feels guilty for what happened. She got very protective of all of us, especially Ashlee. She because a people-pleaser. She pleased me by getting married. Tried to please her father by becoming a realtor. Karen says your husband had quite the gun collection. I'd love to see it. That's not possible. I donated them all to his lodge after he passed. They're probably all auctioned off by now. So there are no guns in the house? Of course not. I noticed a picture here on the way in. A hunting picture with your husband. Is that Karen or is that Lisa? Oh, no, that's not Lisa. Lisa was terrified of guns. I remember George took her hunting one time, and she had nightmares for weeks, poor kid. No, that is my Karen. So Karen went to high school with a couple of these gentlemen. Quite strange, isn't it? Not really. A lot of the neighborhood kids have stuck around. Is there anything else? I really have to get these flowers into water. No. That's great. Thank you very much. I appreciate it. You have a great day. Thank you. I'm gonna ask you a couple of questions, and I want you to tell me the truth. Do you have a gun? Yes. You do? Mm-hm. Where in the world did you get a gun? Dad's friend gave it to me. He gave it to you? Why? Because I asked him to. What are you doing with a gun? I'm doing something. I went to Ray's... because I wanted the two other names of the men that were in the car. Wait a minute. You went over to his house? I found out where he lived. I went over there. He had a knife. I had the gun. I was just asking him to give me the names. He lunged at me, and I had the gun in my hand, and I... What are you doing? You shot that man? I did. My God. Oh, my God. We've got to get you the best lawyer. No. That's not important right now, Mom. What's important is that Ashlee is safe. Of course she's safe. Why wouldn't she be safe? You don't understand. One phone call. These people only have to make one phone call, and Ashlee is dead. Well, then we should call the detective. We should talk to him. The detective. You more than anyone knows that we can't wait for the justice system because it doesn't work! Honey... you can't do this yourself. I can do this. I can fix this. All the guilt that we've had all these years because of Danny, we didn't do anything. And it killed Dad. I can do something... for you, for Ashlee, for Lisa, for Dad. For Danny. I don't want you to get hurt, honey. I'm okay. It's gonna be okay. I don't think you're okay. Look at it again. How many times do I have to tell you? She doesn't look familiar. Isn't that part of your job, to remember your clients' faces? Clients. I'm not a psychologist. I serve drinks. Don't jerk me around. Look at it. Never seen her. The next words out of your mouth better be the ones I want to hear. Man, I don't know. A lot of women come into the bar. I don't remember every single one of 'em. Well, then we'll just wait here until you do. [knocking] [knocking] Coming. Mrs. Donovan, I'm Detective Jesse Katan. We have a search warrant for your house. Come in. [police radio chatter] Okay, so we're clear upstairs and the rest of the rooms. Everything's clean. They're checking the car in the garage now. Anything down here? We got nothing down here. Hey. You're home. Didn't mean to wake you. It's fine. You know that I'm getting too old for a babysitter. [chuckles] I know. Sorry about tonight. My dad's a cop. He's fighting the bad guys. I get it. Thanks. Now let's get some sleep, all right? All right. Good night. Good night. I love you, buddy. So word on Marvin is he's running with a smalltime crew. Jackin' stores. You know, trivial stuff. Then he hooked up with some hoodlum. A real badass. Bobby? I'm not sure. I need a name. And I need to pay my gas bill. That damn energy crisis. Yeah, it's a crime, right? Lance Cooley. [Frank] Police! Lance, stop! Lance! Hey! Freeze! Hey! Hey! Freeze! It all happened so fast. They were wearing masks. I'm sorry. I just can't tell. Thanks for your time, Lucy. Miss Donovan. [door closes] Now, remember, anything you recognize is helpful. Height, weight, body type. I understand. Number one, step forward. Number two. Number three. Number four. Number five. I don't recognize any of them. Are you sure? Yes. Thanks for coming, Miss Donovan. You're welcome, Detective. [door closes] Take 'em back, Scotty. I think she knows something. I don't know what. She didn't I.D. anyone. I think she did. So the woman you saw at the lineup was the same woman from the store. The same lady that was chasing us. 100 percent? Yeah. Randy said some broad was asking around about Marvin after Ray got clipped. How the hell did she find out they worked at Randy's? I don't know, but if she's the one that did him, then she knows about us. [sirens approaching] Yo, I gotta get out of here, man. I got heat all over me. It's only a matter of time before they link me to Marvin. Take it easy, take it easy, all right? The woman's kid's in the hospital, right? We're gonna go there, wait for her to show up, we gotta tie up this loose end, and then we're gonna get out of town for a while. Okay? Okay, good. Just relax. [monitor beeping] [crying] Please come back! [sobbing] Please! [sniffles] I'm so sorry! It was all my fault! [sobbing] [gasps] Geez. I just thought you might want to go home. All right. There's a parking lot on the other side. Yo, turn around. What? Why? Turn around! Why? Yo, I just saw her. Y-You just saw her? Where? Right there, right there. Pull over. That's her. Karen Donovan. "I will exceed your expectations." That'll make things easier. Hold on. Hey, I'm going to lunch. Need anything? Karen. No. This is the name of your one o'clock. Thanks. I'm going home right after this, so just call me if you need me. Okay. Hi! You must be Mister... Burton. Mr. Burton, that's right. Your picture doesn't do you justice. Ready to see your next house? Great. Here we are. Now, based on your price range, I think that this house is a gem. Yeah, look at the square footage. It's a steal. The floors, as you can see, have all been refinished, and the tile in the fireplace has all been replaced. And as you can hear, it's very quiet. You can't even hear the street noise. Perfect. Wanna start upstairs? Sure. The house is loaded with amenities, plenty of bathrooms and bedrooms, but let's start with the master suite. This house is like a maze. You could get lost in here. The house doesn't have any mold, does it? No, none that's been disclosed. It's a relatively new house. Look at the view. It's beautiful. Shall we look at the other bedrooms? Sure. So the stove and the refrigerator are new, and this house comes with a washer and dryer. Oh, and I forgot to mention the pool. [woman] Yoo-hoo! Is anybody home? Yes! Hi. We saw the "for sale" sign outside. Is there any way we can look around? I'm sorry, but I'm with a client right now. You know, I just realized the time. I forgot I have an appointment. I completely spaced. Mr. Burton, uh... It's okay. I'll let you know. Thank you very much. I appreciate the time. It's a wonderful home. Thank you. Hello. Let me show you the house. [Frank] Let's just focus on Lance right now. Somewhere in here is a connection between Lance, Raymond, and Marvin. We are missing something. Let's run it again. All right. Well, Ray was the wheel man. Marvin's on the inside. Lance is the second gunman and the bagman, and some guy named Bobby is the leader, right? Ray and Marvin work at Randy's Auto, but not Lance. No. Our boy Lance here, he's done some time. Neither Marvin nor Ray have any priors, so how do these guys know each other? Maybe they didn't. Maybe they knew Bobby. Lance was collecting unemployment from the Selmeth Corporation. Yeah, I saw that. You saw this? Yeah. What'd I miss? What's up with the Selmeth Corporation? I don't know. Let's look it up. [typing] All right, there it is. Selmeth Corporation. It's a chemical and additive supplier. Lance was a delivery man. Uh, there it is. "Randy's Auto." Come on! Here we go. Wanna take a sec? Yeah. One, two... Clear in here. [phone rings] Newman. Randy Dennis in custody. What about Karen Donovan? [Anderson] She's just leaving her office. In a hurry. Lisa! She's gonna be okay. [laughs] She came out of it about an hour ago. [monitor beeping] Hey there, sweetie. I miss those beautiful eyes. [sighs] Did we win? What? The lottery. [laughs] Randy got picked up. Yeah, I heard. You didn't tell him about me, did you? Hell no. What do I look like? Good. My cousin's gonna put us up for a while, then we'll figure something out. Cool. Is that all our money? Yeah. That's all of it. Wanna see it? Sure. So it's over now. I don't know if it's over. Just because Ashlee's out of the coma, they could come here. I'm over my head. I think it's time to tell Frank everything and turn myself in. But if you tell the police, they're gonna arrest you for murder. But I still have Ray's confession tape. But that doesn't matter. I did what I had to do. I will face the consequences. Just do me a favor, Mom. Don't tell Lisa. Let her enjoy the moment. Believe me, I'm not telling anyone anything. I trust you. I love you. Be careful. [dialing] [line ringing] This is Detective Frank Newman. Please leave a message at the sound of the tone. [beep] Hi, Frank. I was hoping to talk to you, but... I have great news. Ashlee's awake. We're all very excited. Um... But there is something that I need to talk to you about. I'm gonna make my way over to your office. [line ringing] Frank? Uh, no. This is Robert Burton. Who? Oh! Mr. Burton. Um, yes. Actually, this is a bad time. Listen, I left my cell phone at the house you were showing me. Uh, okay. I'll just have someone from the office go to the house in the morning. It's really an emergency. My daughter, she ran away from home, and... her boyfriend's number is in it. My wife, she's just beside herself. Uh, okay. I'll, um... I'll meet you at the house in 20 minutes? Oh, thank you. You're a life saver. [police radio chatter] It's Lance. His body's still warm. Hey, where you at? More importantly, where's Karen? [Anderson] I'm keeping an eye on our friend. She just pulled up to a house. 229 Kinsey Road. [Frank] Can I place her at a crime scene downtown about three hours ago? No. No way. I've been following her all day. I don't see how. Says she never left her sight. What do we got forensically? Hollow point. It's the same bullet used at the convenience store. So what, now they're killing each other? Looks that way. You gotta check this out. [phone ringing] [ring] [ring] Frank? Hello? Hi. I'm on my way to you. I just have to make a quick stop... Hello? Frank? Karen! [line ringing] Come on, Tom, pick up. This is Detective Anderson. I'm currently unavailable... Who left the light on? [siren blaring] Go, Anderson, pick up! I got a man down. 229 Kinsey Road. I need backup right away. [screams] Wha... Mr. Burton, right? Call me Bobby. Call me Bobby. Did you tell the cops about me? No. Marvin didn't give you my name? No, nothing. How did you find Ray, Sherlock? We went to school together. No. I-I went to high school with Ray. Do I know you? You knew my brother Danny. What are the odds of that? Karen? [yelps] Frank. He's got a gun. Bet that hurts, doesn't it? [groans] You ready to die, my friend? Frank. Frank. You're hurt. I can just, um... I'm... I'm gonna put a little pressure on you. What else is new? So that's Bobby. Yeah. [sirens approaching] No. Frank, what are you doing? Making sure it looks like self-defense. No. Yeah. Listen, Frank, before they get here, I have to tell you what I did. No. It ends tonight, here. [sirens arriving] [chatter, laughter] Oh! [laughs] I'm going to the hospital. Okay, great, go. Have fun. Ah! Keep it up! Lovebirds... Bye-bye, baby. Bye. Thank you. I'll see you later. Bye. Ah! Here we go. Okay, take over, Mama. Honey, honey, honey... thank you so much for your courage. You kept us all safe. And your daddy is so proud of you right now. And your brother, too. Now go... have some fun. [knocking] Come in. Hey. How's the family? Uh, good, they're good. How are you? I'm good. What's that for? Well, I learned that that's what girls do when they like a boy. You saying you like me? Yeah, I'm saying I like you. [Steven] Hey. That's my kid. Steven. Hi, Steven. Hi. I'm Karen. Nice to meet you. You have any kids? I have a niece. And a cat. A cat? Yeah. What's his name? His name is Fred. He's got arthritis. Really? Sorry about that. Do you like animals? Yup. We got a dog named Benny. Oh. Does Benny know any tricks? Well, yeah, he could sit. Well, that's great. Yeah. That's it, though. He's a lab. I love labs. Yeah, he's cool.
