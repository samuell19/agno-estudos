[Thump] Whew. Ohh! You didn't tell me you were gonna kill it. [Crying] - [Wings flapping] - [Eerie moaning] [Menaching laughter] [Ghostly owl hoot] [Hooting] Thanks, old pal. Charge! Never jump into a pile of leaves with a wet sucker. Say, Charlie Brown, I've got a football. How about practicing a few placekicks? I'll hold the ball, and you come running and kick it. Oh, brother. I don't mind your dishonesty half as much as I mind your opinion of me. You must think I'm stupid. Oh, come on, Charlie Brown. No! I'll hold it steady. No. Please? You just want me to come running up to kick that ball so you can pull it away and see me land flat on my back and kill myself. This time you can trust me. See? Here's a signed document testifying that I promise not to pull it away. It is signed. It's a signed document. I guess if you have a signed document in your possession, you can't go wrong. This year I'm really gonna kick that football. Aagh! Peculiar thing about this document... it was never notarized. Who are you writing to, Linus? This is the time of year to write to the Great Pumpkin. On Halloween night, the Great Pumpkin rises out of his pumpkin patch and flies through the air with a bag of toys for all the children. You must be crazy! When are you going to stop believing in something that isn't true? When you stop believing in that fellow with the red suit and the white beard who goes, "ho ho ho." We are obviously separated by denominational differences. [Snickering] [Laughing] Not again? Writing a letter to a stupid pumpkin? You make me the laughingstock of the neighborhood! All they talk about is my little brother who always writes to the Great Pumpkin. You better cut it out right now or I'll pound you! There are three things I have learned never to discuss with people-- religion, politics, and the Great Pumpkin. You're wasting your time! The Great Pumpkin is a fake! What are you doing, Linus? I'd rather not say. You might laugh. Oh, I'd never laugh at you, Linus. You're so intelligent. I'm writing to the Great Pumpkin. You say the cutest things. On Halloween night, the Great Pumpkin rises out of the pumpkin patch then flies through the air to bring toys to all the good little children everywhere. Wouldn't you like to sit with me in the pumpkin patch on Halloween night and wait for the Great Pumpkin? Oh, I'd love to, Linus. What's going on here? What are you trying to do to my little sister? And how do you think you're gonna mail that letter? You can't possibly reach the mailbox. And I'm not gonna help you. Hey! I got an invitation to a Halloween party! Is the invitation to Violet's party, Charlie Brown? Yes. It's the first time I've ever been invited to a party. Charlie Brown, if you got an invitation, it was a mistake. There were two lists, Charlie Brown-- one to invite and one not to invite. You must've been put on the wrong list. Eek! A person should always choose a costume which is in direct contrast to her own personality. Is Linus taking me to the party? LUCY: That stupid blockhead of a brother of mine is out in the pumpkin patch making his yearly fool of himself. Boy, is he strange. But maybe there is a Great Pumpkin. Every year Linus misses tricks or treats and then the Halloween party. He'll never learn. Do I get to go trick-or-treating this year, big brother? Sure, Sally. Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy! How do we do it? LUCY: All you have to do is walk up to a house, ring the doorbell, and say, "tricks or treats." Are you sure it's legal? LUCY: Of course it's legal. I wouldn't want to be accused of taking part in a rumble. LUCY: Oh, good grief. Is that you, Patty? No. SHERMY: Where is Charlie Brown? CHARLIE: Here I am. I had a little trouble with the scissors. PIG-PEN: They'll never guess it's me under here. SALLY: Hello, Pig-Pen. Glad you could make it. How did you know it was me? LUCY: What in the world kind of costume is that? CHARLIE: He's a World War I flying ace. LUCY: Now I've heard everything! LUCY: All right, everybody, we'll go trick-or-treating and then over to Violet's for the big Halloween party. [All cheering] [Military marching drum cadence] Hey, have you come to sing pumpkin carols? LUCY: You blockhead! You're gonna miss all the fun, just like last year. Don't talk like that. The Great Pumpkin knows which kids have been good and which kids have been bad. You'll be sorry. LUCY: Oh, good grief. He'll come here because I have the most sincere pumpkin patch and he respects sincerity. Do you really think he'll come? Tonight the Great Pumpkin rises out of the pumpkin patch, he flies through the air, and brings toys to all the children of the world. That's a good story. You don't believe the story of the Great Pumpkin? I thought little girls always believed everything that was told to them. I thought little girls were innocent and trusting. Welcome to the 20th century. LUCY: All right, once and for all, are you coming or are you staying? LUCY: We can't waste all night. I'm glad you came back, Sally. We'll just sit here in this pumpkin patch, and you'll see the Great Pumpkin with your own eyes. If you try to hold my hand, I'll slug you. Each year the Great Pumpkin rises out of the pumpkin patch that he thinks is the most sincere. He's gotta pick this one! He's got to! I don't see how a pumpkin patch can be more sincere than this one. You can look all around, and there's not a sign of hypocrisy. Nothing but sincerity as far as the eye can see. ALL: Trick or treats, money or eats! LUCY: Can I have an extra piece of candy for my stupid brother? LUCY: He couldn't come with us 'cause he's sitting in a pumpkin patch waiting for the Great Pumpkin. LUCY: It's so embarrassing to have to ask for something extra for that blockhead, Linus. LUCY: I got five pieces of candy. SHERMY: I got a chocolate bar. VIOLET: I got a quarter. CHARLIE: I got a rock. ALL: Trick or treat! VIOLET: Gee, I got a candy bar. SHERMY: Boy, I got three cookies. LUCY: Hey, I got a package of gum. CHARLIE: I got a rock. LUCY: Trick or treat. LUCY: I got a popcorn ball. SHERMY: I got a fudge bar. VIOLET: I got a pack of gum. CHARLIE: I got a rock. SHERMY: By the way, whatever happened to the World War I flying ace? CHARLIE: Oh, he's probably getting ready to take off in his Sopwith Camel on the next dawn patrol. [♪ Trumpet fanfare] CHARLIE: His mission is to find the Red Baron and shoot him down. Here's the World War I flying ace climbing into the cockpit of his Sopwith Camel. CHARLIE: "Contact!" he shouts. [Motor sputtering to life] [Motor revving] [Motor increasing speed] [Buzzing through sky] [Machine gun fire] [Taunting] [Laughing] [Machine gun firing] [Machine gun firing] [Loud bang] - [Engine cutting out] - [Rocketing projectile] [Crashing] CHARLIE: Here's the World War I flying ace imagining he's down behind enemy lines, making his way across the French countryside. LUCY: Come on, let's get going. It's time for the Halloween party. [All shouting] VIOLET [Mockingly]: Has the Great Pumpkin been by? VIOLET: Ah, ha-ha-ha-ha! LUCY: What blockheads, sitting in a pumpkin patch in the middle of the night. VIOLET: You've missed trick-or-treat, and now, you're going to miss the Halloween party. SHERMY: What a way to spend Halloween. [Group laughing] - You think you're so smart. - [Laughing continues] - Just wait until the Great Pumpkin comes. - [Laughing continues] He'll be here! You can bet on that! Linus knows what he's talking about. Linus knows what he's doing. All right, where is he? He'll be here. I hope so. I have my reputation to think of, you know. And just think of all the fun we're missing. Just look. Nothing but sincerity as far as the eye can see. [Party goers shouting] Charlie Brown, you'll have to model for us. Me? You want me to model? Sure, Charlie Brown. You'll be the perfect model. Turn him around. If we shape the eyes like this... and the nose like this... and the mouth like this... Yes, that's the way. Thank you, Charlie Brown. You were a perfect model. [Distant artillery fire] [Train whistle] [Distant artillery fire] [Shouting] All right, all right. Let's bob for apples. This is the way to do it. SCHROEDER: Yeah, Lucy, you should be good at this. You have the perfect mouth for it. Blech! My lips touched dog lips! Blech! Ugh! Poison! Dog lips! Blech! Ugh! [♪ Upbeat inspirational tune] [♪ Slower tune] [Sniffing] [Sobbing] [♪ Upbeat inspirational tune] [♪ Slower dramatic tune] [Sniffing] [Whimpering] [Crying] [Howling] If anyone had told me I'd be waiting in a pumpkin patch on Halloween night, I'd have said they were crazy. Just think, Sally. When the Great Pumpkin rises out of the pumpkin patch, - we'll be here to see him. - [Bushes rustling] What's that...? What's that...? I hear the Great Pumpkin! There he is! There he is! It's the Great Pumpkin! He's rising up out of the pumpkin patch! What happened? Did I faint? What did he leave us? Did he leave us any toys? I was robbed! I spent the whole night waiting for the Great Pumpkin when I could have been out for tricks or treats! Halloween is over, and I missed it! You blockhead! You kept me up all night waiting for the Great Pumpkin! And all that came was a beagle! I didn't get a chance to go out for tricks or treats! And it was your fault! I'll sue! What a fool I was! I could have had candy apples, and gum, and cookies, and money, and all sorts of things! But no! I had to listen to you, you blockhead. What a fool I was. Trick or treats come only once a year and I miss it by sitting in a pumpkin patch with a blockhead. You owe me restitution! You heard about fury and a woman scorned, haven't you? Yes, I guess I have. Well, that's nothing compared to the fury of a woman who has been cheated out of tricks or treats. Hey, aren't you going to wait and greet the Great Pumpkin, huh? It won't be long now. If the Great Pumpkin comes, I'll still put in a good word for you. Good grief. I said "if." I meant, when he comes! I'm doomed. One little slip like that can cause the Great Pumpkin to pass you by. Oh, Great Pumpkin, where are you? [Alarm Ringing] Well, another Halloween has come and gone. Yes, Charlie Brown. I don't understand it. I went trick-or-treating and all I got was a bag full of rocks. I suppose you spent all night in the pumpkin patch. - And the Great Pumpkin never showed up? - Nope. Well, don't take it too hard, Linus. I've done a lot of stupid things in my life, too. Stupid? What do you mean, stupid? Just wait 'til next year, Charlie Brown. You'll see. Next year at this same time I'll find a pumpkin patch that is real sincere, and I'll sit in that pumpkin patch until the Great Pumpkin appears. He'll rise out of that pumpkin patch and he'll fly through the air with his bag of toys. The Great Pumpkin will appear! And I'll be waiting for him! I'll be there! I'll be sitting there in that pumpkin patch, and I'll see the Great Pumpkin! Just wait and see, Charlie Brown! I'll see that Great Pumpkin! I'll see the Great Pumpkin! Just you wait, Charlie Brown! The Great Pumpkin will appear, [Audio fading] and I'll be waiting for...!
