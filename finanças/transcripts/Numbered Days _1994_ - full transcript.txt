Is he coming? Over. - Do you read me? - I read you. We've put up a control at mile 82. I repeat, control at mile 82. Central here, await further orders. I repeat, await further orders. Hi, my name's Clara. Hi, Clara. A blow job's worth 50. Back to the freeway? There he is. What's he doing? - Being a smart ass as usual. - What's he up to? He loves taking chance and fucking us up. I don't believe it. He wouldn't dare. You don't know him. Now what? Take the freeway. The guy's nuts. Good afternoon. - Hello. You just moved in? We're neighbors. - I'm Charo, and you? - Antonio. Can you bust locks? This one's real easy. I know nothing about locks. Call a locksmith. That costs money. Hey, give it a try. In movies, they use a credit card. My hubby always used a wire. Sorry, I don't have one. I'm just a beginner. My hubby opened doors like nothing. He never caused any damage it's worse if you do. It's robbery with violence, otherwise, it's just theft. - Why don't you call him up? - He's doing time up north. He's real cute his name's Alfredo. I can't open it. Sorry, baby. Hey, can I come in? I'm freezing. - I'm on my way out. - I'm wetting my pants. All right, come in. What are you doing? Just so Vanessa knows I'm here. Hey! Hey! Listen to me. Pick up your shit and get the hell out. Hey, man, I ain't no junkie. I was strung out because I got upset. - But I can kick it any time. - Yeah, sure. Come on, get moving. Hi, is Charo in? Yes, in the bathroom. Just tell her I'm back, okay? I'm Vanessa. Glad to meet you. I couldn't help it. You've got some nerve. Like them? Yeah, I've got to admit you have nice tits. My hubby liked them too. Come here, sit down. I like being looked at. After shooting up, I love smoking a joint. It's real relaxing. - Want some? - No, thanks, I don't smoke. Well, I'm a photographer. - For fashion magazines? - No. I work for an agency. I don't get it. Well, I choose a subject, take pictures. If they like it, they pay me for it. I'm working on something in this area. I know loads of people around here. I can give you a hand. Thanks, I'll remember that. How about taking my picture in the tub? Yeah? It would come out nice. - You mean it? - Sure, I do. Come on. What do I do? That's up to you. That's some scar. A souvenir from jail, Vanessa saved my skin. Hold it! Wait wet your lips. That's it. Again. See if you like that. Hold it, don't move. Close your eyes. Stop it! I'm sorry, I really am. - I behaved like an idiot. - Yeah. I know the story, but I don't wanna screw. Because of my husband. Even if the bastard doesn't deserve it. You'd want your wife to screw someone else? I'm not married. - You've never been married? - No. You're putting me on. That's Vanessa. Give me a towel. I'll be right out. Can't you shut up? You never stop talking. Hi. Can you tell Charo. we're going down? Come in, she'll be right out. That's Ugarte. Man, you got a T. V... that's great! Hi. I'm Vanessa's boyfriend. - There he goes blabbing again.. - Antonio's a photographer. Oh? I can't stand having my picture taken. - What camera have you got? - A Nikon. - You like photography? - I wanted to be a photographer. And a mechanic, a doctor, don't pay him any attention. It's true, I wanted to be a photographer. You got no personality. Don't pick on my biker. - How about a beer? - I can't, sorry. - I'm buying. Well, see you later. You're a sweetheart. The cab station in San Bernardo Street. I got into the cab and told the driver: "I'll suck you for five tenners." Here, have one of these, you need it. Cheer up! Anyway, the asshole said yes. When we got back, he talked to two buddies, they were no trouble. The last one started playing with his dick... and I thought: "Go ahead, less work for me." He said 50 was too much for such a fast job. There's Lisardo. But I ain't gonna beg him. Same thing happened to me with Alfredo. I'd see him and get wet all over. That's the problem. Men know it and treat us like shit. Your Alfredo behaved like a bastard. What's up? Come on, baby, gimme a spoon and some water What's going on? Come on over here. It's the last time. - The old man gave me hell. - Don't whine, Maria. You're always whining. Come on, come here. - I got you another party. - Great! We need the dough. But I need more girls. How about asking Rosa? How much? 200 each. Hear that? Fucking great! You gotta take five grams of coke. They'll pay for it. But no junk, these guys ain't into junk. And I want fifty for my work. - No way, twenty each. - Ten each. What the fuck? Twenty each after we get paid. All right. When is it for? I ain't quite sure... but real soon, they're from out of town. We better speak to the Portuguese. Five teaspoons is a lot. There he is. Wait! - What's wrong? - The place is full of cops. What cops? Don't be mental. Ain't no cops. - Have a beer with us. - No thanks, not now Antonio, our neighbor. This is Lisardo. Antonio's a photographer. - He's working the area. - Really? How original! - What's your subject? - People like you. Like me? You ain't never seen a junkie like me, you know. Don't be an ass! You've gone too far. Let's split. Hey, Alfredo's been moved to the Madrid jail. What? Yeah, the bastard gave the Poruguese a message. What did he say? That he'll be out soon. He forgives you and wants to bang you. - Cocky bastard. - I want him to bang me. After all he did to you? You're out of your mind. Hi. Here. - I thought you'd like it. - Come in. - For me? - Yeah, it's for you. Wow, man, I look just like me. The Alhambra, in Granada. Alfredo did that, he's a real handyman. I'm gonna take off my T-shirt. Don't get a hard-on, okay? There's beer in the fridge, we went shopping. Mind putting some on my back? How beautiful, you look like a buttered sweet-roll. Hey, man, how about bringing your TV set? There's a real cool contest on this afternoon. - The antenna? - We used to have a TV too. We did, until Lisardo sold it. He said he'd buy us a new one. - You believe him? - You're gonna bring it? All right. Collagen? What's that? It gets into your skin and leaves it real smooth. The ad said Caroline of Monaco uses it. Caroline? It's got to be good. Who's there? Why are you here? I came to see you. Is that bad? Not bad, dangerous. Really? How about using a whore to pass a control? Listen, we already discussed it. It was foolish, but it worked, so what? You jeopardized the whole operation. Can I stay? No, you can't. Because of her? You better leave. Wait. Give me your key. I mean it... you won't screw us up because of some cunt... get it? Need a hand? Yeah... close the door behind me. Was that your wife? I told you I'm not married. She works for the agency. Why was she pissed? Was she? I hadn't noticed. Hi. I just met the Portuguese, he'll drop by tomorrow. What did he tell you for? He knows you're my girl. Don't start, Ugarte, I'll have a fit. You know the Portuguese? - No. - That guy scares me, man. I heard he fought in Angola. His hands and feet are lethal weapons. The way he works with the slicer! One hand, the other... real quick like. And when you least expect it, in it goes. Ain't nothing like a gun. See? No one's gonna fuck with you. No need to know karate with this. Don't be an ass. Lisardo! Put it away! Ain't nobody gonna get on your back with this. You're always right. Didn't you hear her? This is her house. Let go, man. Come on, let go, man. Be a pal, let go. Let go, Christ! Let go! Fuck. Bang! You're dead! Good evening. According to the police... several members from an ETA commando unit... have come to Madrid. The terrorists, who are known to the police... took advantage of the fact that many Basque citizens... came to Madrid over the weekend to watch... an important football game. According to the police... the Madrid commando unit, in spite of having been... deactivated several times... has a base... I'd hang those bastards by the balls. This unit is one of the most vicious... You want five grams? Okay by me. But five grams are worth 600. Where's the dough? Wait a minute, we've always been straight with you. Don't give us that shit. Hard times. Nobody gives credit. Things have changed. Get it? Where the fuck is the money? - Where did you put the dough? - Don't ask me! Get off my back! I don't feel well. - There was a hundred in here - Go to hell! I swear it. One hundred? That's not enough. I want 250 at least. Tell him to go away! Kick him out! We'll get another dealer! We can make do without you, Portuguese. Very well. Very well. As you wish. Wait, Portuguese! You'll get the money tomorrow. We want five grams. And I want 300. All right, 300. The rest after the party. Just give me 300... and it will be on the level, completely on the level. That's right, on the level, as it should be. Fine. Very good. I wanna sleep! Why don't you just fuck off? Wait! You gonna see Alfredo? Maybe. If you do... tell him that if he wants to bang me... he's gonna have to say he's sorry. If he don't, he can go fuck himself. All right. Let's go over it again. You'll be coming down this street and park here... at the corner. You leave the engine running. One thing, what if someone's parked or a truck's unloading? It's unlikely that early. If something like that came up... just go on. Wait 20 minutes and try again, okay? All right. I'll double park... right here... looking straight at the police station. After I turn the engine on... I'll need ten seconds to reach your car... and get out. I have to cross... about 70 yards. Leave it to me, I'll give you 15 seconds. When will it blow? As soon as the car hits the wall. What if it fails? It doesn't usually. A second device would take over... there's no way to stop that one. It's fail-proof. No matter what, 20 seconds... and it will all blow to hell. What's the load? Heavy. 200 pounds. It's going to be murder, right downtown. Did they approve? You can fix the car, I'll take care of the rest. - Okay? - What about tomorrow? I don't know. That bomb's been sent to us. I hope it's okay. Why's that? Last time, in Barcelona, the material was no good. - Whose fault was it? - Who do you think? That asshole who's made it to the top... and can't tell his right from his left. We risk our necks while he gets the medals. That's questionable. You find it normal to drive the cars over here? Or to have to get information ourselves? We're going through bad times. He's an ass! - That's no way to speak. - Listen... don't fuck with me. - Are we done? - Yes. I'll be in my room. You should be more careful in front of Carlos. Don't you start. You'll sleep here? How will we get the dough? We can work a few cab drivers. Yeah, sure... I do the blowjobs, not you. It turns you on. Like hell it does, some of them make me sick. Now, I wouldn't mind sucking the Portuguese. He really turns me on. He doesn't give a shit about women. He ain't no fairy, that's for sure. He's real cold. He doesn't care about chicks like us. He used to screw Rosa. Jesus, I'm tired! I can't sleep. Got any bennies? It won't do any good after the beers. You'll just get horny. Doesn't shooting up make you less horny? That's silly! We don't do that much either. What are you thinking about? My mother. When we were broke, she'd say she'd be better off whoring. We ain't whores. I ain't a whore, right? Maybe we are. Don't say that, we ain't whores. The door was open. Vanessa's sleeping. Come in. Has my skin improved? - It's for the party. - What party? - The one Lisardo got us. - What do you do there? What do you think? They don't pay just for looking. That's got a name. You're jealous! Why the hell would I be? Antonio, I don't screw just anyone. Nobody lays a hand on me, I just take my clothes off. You like to see me naked, don't you? I know you like me, I can tell. I like you too. I like being with you. But Alfredo's in the cooler. Hi. Well, can't you say hello? Vanessa, cover yourself up. So, the little girls are having a party? Anyone else around? I'm asking you, Charo. Where's the Portuguese, under the bed? No, sir. There's no one else here. They're clean. Clean? The place is a pigsty. What about him? Yeah, you. Who are you? You live here? I live next door. Next door. Yes, next door. What do you want? Nothing special. We came for a chat. - The Portuguese isn't here. - Listen... we heard you got a deal with him. You're gonna buy five grams from him. Right? I'm never wrong. I don't care about you two, I want the Portuguese. May I see your search warrant? Sorry, smart ass, the young ladies let us in. I didn't! Get out! Why don't you shut up like a good girl? No point getting upset. We're real pals, aren't we? You've come in without the tenants' consent. I don't know you. You're new around? I've rented the studio next door. Fine. Give me your ID. I'm under no obligation to, as you should know. Well, well. When I first saw you... I took you for a poor slob they had picked up. All right... I was wrong. You happen to be an asshole. I'm not calling you names. I'm not bothering anyone, am I? Sure, neither am I. We've done nothing. If you were my daughter... I'd beat the hell out of you. Filthy, whoring around and a junkie to top it all. Don't call us names! You've no warrant and you're insulting us. You sure make things hard. I bet this place is full of dope. I know it is. How do you make a living? You don't fucking work. He takes pictures for a magazine. - Shut up! - I'm a press photographer. All right. Why didn't you say so? - You got some kind of card? - Certainly. At my place. Bring it... please. What's the point? Not even a pig would live here. We've got nothing against you. Want a blow job? I won't charge you. I just want to talk, no need to be gross. Why don't you fuck off? You need a beating. Fine. All right. Let's forget it. All right. Those two little sluts are no good, watch out. Charo's husband can be real mean. He's so jealous he killed a guy. Watch out where you're gonna dip. - Thanks for the warning. - Sure. I like helping the press, you guys are okay. Let's go. Antonio! You were great, Vanessa couldn't believe it. Come here. No, don't. Well? You're gonna give me that shit about your husband? It's not him now. I got the hots for you. Well? But... it's got to be different. Listen, that cop knows everything. Someone's blabbed. A squealer? I don't see... There's an informer, just be careful. I don't want to fuck. Can I stay here? As you wish. Sometimes, I think... about myself. About my life. About us. I can't go on. I can't! My world's falling apart. Good night. Hi, put me through to the editing department. Hello. We've just abandoned a Renault 11... with the owner locked in the trunk. The car's on the hill... across from the old Fenosa offices. "Gora Euskadi, gora ETA!" My purse! What? My purse... I've left it inside the car. What? Forget it, they'll be here any minute. How could you? Someone's coming. Come on, go away. It's going to blow. Shit! Come on, let's go. I get out here. But I don't drink. Come on, have a drink. - Hi. - Is Charo around? She just left with Vanessa and Lisardo. - Where to? - Lisardo found them a job. A guy who owns a shop or something. They'll be back later. - How about a drink? - Yeah, a beer. Mind buying me on? I'm broke. - Rosa, two beers! - Coming up. This is Barbara, she's a dancer. - I'm an actress. - Well, what do you think? Stop it, asshole! - How about taking her picture? - I don't have my camera. Antonio's a photographer, I told you about him. He's real famous, we're pals. I want to show my book to the TV people. I'd like to work as a commentator... or maybe in a talk show, you know. - Anything. - Antonio can give you a hand. - He takes great pictures. - You do? Excuse me. They're not even twenty. 130 for the two of them. 130. 120, it's a deal. Okay. You'll take my picture when I get my Yamaha? It's for my Mom, so she can see me on my bike. You'll see... Vanessa will lose her panties. I know she loves me. Come here, you and I gotta talk. Let go, fuck off! Let go! - Come here! - I ain't going nowhere! I said come here! - Goddamn it! - Motherfucker! Hands off! Look! Look! Look what I'm doing! Look! Look! Look at me! Look, Vanessa! Look at me! Give me that knife! Fucking great! Come on. Get in. I want you tonight. Where? Wherever you say, your place, a hotel, choose. Granada. You're serious? You have to fuck me in the Alhambra. Why not? You thought I'd back out? - We want a good room. - All our rooms are good. A very good one, then. - May I have your I.D.? - Of course. Have you got yours? Mine's in the car. Sign here. Sorry, sign here. Your luggage? - Your luggage? - We don't have any. - How long will you stay? - We still don't know. Very well. - Than ks. - The elevator is over there. Welcome. Relax, relax. Wait. Wait. We've slept all day. What's that, hash? I've never tried it. - You're putting me on. - No, I mean it. May I? See? Why did we come here? I made love for the first time here. In this hotel? Jesus, no. I wish I had. In a car. But it was nice. Who with? Alfredo? What was I like in bed? Better or worse than him? Neither, simply different. That's no answer. It's the only one you'll get. Here. I'm getting out. Stay a while. - Come on. - No. Let's do it. I don't feel like it. I want to see the news. When the police arrived, they found a dantesque spectacle. The car had exploded, killing Norberto Sénchez... a tramp who lived by selling scrap iron. The police are now looking... for Lourdes Mendiguren. Apparently, the terrorist left her purse in the car. The police were also able to identify... José Lizabarrengoa... alias, Josebe de Elizondo. He is the second member of the commano unit. He's accused... of murdering a policeman in Madrid. Lizabarrengoa has a very long police record. He used to be part... of the Barcelona commando unit. He took part in the... worse terrorist attempts carried out... in that city. The State security forces are now working... to catch... the commando unit which... apparently, is still in Madrid. The State... Shit! Charo! Charo! - What will you do to me? - I'm taking you home. What about you? I'll take one. Thanks. You're robbing your boss, Rosa? I heard they were letting you out. It's a good deal. They kick me out at 9 a.m., I gotta be back at 10 pm. Great, isn't it? Gimme a beer. I'm waiting for someone. You mean the Portuguese. Why do you ask? - He ain't coming. How come? Him and me are partners. Here, five grams on the heavy side. You got the dough? 300 now. The rest afterwards. After what? The party. Charo's going to the party too? Don't start with that. Let her be. It wasn't easy for her. You 3 Sister of Charity or what? Get going, I got work. Know what I heard? The Portuguese got a dose when he banged you. No wonder Charo fools around. You looked for it. She fools around? Who with? Ask around, everyone knows about it. That Portuguese guy leads a double life. Like, during the day, he acts real hard up... but in the evenings... he's rich. I've seen him... dine in the best restaurants in town. - I bet he's loaded. - That's for sure, sir. He's bringing five grams to the girls tonight. Where is he? Come on, man! Want me to spell it? You sure like games. The check! - Is it what I told you? - No, not at all. According to Carlos... you're to go back after the job's done. You know what that means. Those kinds of threats don't scare me anymore. What will you do? Go back? I worry about what you're thinking. I know you well. After the job's done... I may disappear. It's ready. Twenty seconds once the engine is turned on. Five more than you asked. If you're quitting, do it now. I'll go with you. Don't fool yourself, you can't come. Get him out of your mind. He's a terrorist. Don't you watch TV or what? They even kill kids! Cheer up, you want to look good for the party. It's Antonio! Don't open it! Don't open it! Charo, please, don't! Some welcome. - Hi, there, how are you? - Just fine. You wanted to see me? No problem, but I'll call my lawyer first. Put your hands on the car, scumbag! Hey, hold it, I'm clean. I don't walk around the street loaded, man. You ain't getting out of this one, shithead. End of the road. Rafa! Rafa, wait, there's plenty for us both. - Just name your price. - Walk. I'm in a hurry. All right, kneel. Kneel. Rafa. Rafa. What are you gonna do? Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Please. Another dealer killed while squaring accounts. Just that. A black shit to make it even easier. No one will bother to look into it. You're scared... aren't you? Say it! Yes, I'm scared. Say it louder. I'm... scared. Real scared. Again! Say you're yellow, Portuguese. I'm... yellow. I'm yellow. Rafa, I'm yellow. We all are, Portuguese. Everyone. - Hello. And Vanessa? With Lisardo, having a quickie. She won't be long. - Want a drink? - No, thanks. I got a surprise for you. He's come to say goodbye. - Where is he? - Taking a leak. Hi, Charo. I came to say goodbye. I'm going to see my mom. - How do you feel? - Great. I'll have my bike pretty soon. And in there? - How are you doing? - I'm cured too. I mean it. - Hi, Vanessa. - Hi. Ugarte's going back to Seville. Yeah? You're gonna tell your mom you didn't bang her? Don't be an ass, Lisardo. You shut up, cutie. We all know you're banging a fucking terrorist. Good luck. The same to you. Let's go, Rosa. Wait for me! Do a good job. Gimme a coin to make a call. Bye, Lisardo. Good evening. May I speak to Inspector Rafa? I see. Well, could you... tell him I'll call back later? I'm Lisardo, he knows me. Please tell him... I got something for him. Something real big... about a terrorist. Yeah. Yeah, thanks. Okay. Hey, girls, get in. Get in, damn it! You deaf or something? Why? We haven't done anything. What about her? Get in. Come on, move it. Come on, Charo... you asleep? Move your ass. Come on, Charo.
