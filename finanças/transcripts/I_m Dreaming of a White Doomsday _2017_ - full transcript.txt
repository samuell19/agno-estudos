Ooh, how 'bout this right here? Put that there. Where're we gonna put granny's ornament? - Ooh, how 'bout right there next to the garland? Do you think Santa's gonna like it? - Of course I do. I think he's gonna love it. - Yeah, yeah, I think he's gonna love it. It's got a uh, sort of a, a post-modern look. Yes, I think he's really going to enjoy it. Hey, you can't have those. Those are for santa. - What? Come on. - You know that Santa gets first pick, every single year. - I do. I do know this, and that is why I also know that these ones here are his favorite, so this doesn't really matter. - I heard that Santa's having a really hard time fitting into his suit this year. - 'Cause he's fat? Yeah, we've gotta watch over those cookies. - Yeah. - Hey. - You know what else? I think that it snowed last night. - Can I go out and play in the snow? - Hmm, well, let me see. Let me think about that. Of course. - Yes. - But, I think you should ask daddy to go out and play with you, after he's done chewing this cookie. - I would like to play in the snow with you, but I'm supposed to build a snowman. That's right. - Right, and I don't have anyone to build it with, and I need someone else to build it with. Do you know anyone that can build a snowman? - I can. - You could build a snowman with me? Well, then let's go. Let's do it, put your clothes on. - Okay, well you two have fun, all right? But bundle up, or you'll both turn into snowmen. Riley. Riley, you forgot your hat. Riley! - Mommy, I'm hungry. - Okay, hun. I'll make us some dinner, all right? All right. - Simon, please. Are you crazy? You can't go out there again. I don't have a choice. - You're gonna get yourself killed. - I'll be fine. That's set to channel two, okay? Don't open that door for anyone until you hear from me, all right? - Okay. Wait. What about Riley? He needs you. And I need you. - What we need is supplies. We can't sit around down here, waiting for some magic solution to show up, 'cause it's not comin', and if I don't go out there and get us food and water, we're dead anyway. It's just, I can't, I can't, I can't do this. Why are you crying, mommy? - Honey, it's okay. Here, come. Come here, give me a hug. Oh boy. Look, daddy just, he's gotta go away for a little while. Okay? - Listen. I do, I have to go out for a little bit, but I'll be back real soon, all right? - Where do you have to go? - Well, I gotta go out and get more food, and maybe some clothes. What do you think? - And toys? - Of course. And toys, of course. But, listen, I need you to do me a favor, all right? While I'm gone, I need you to be the man of the house. You know, take care of your mom while I'm away. Think you can do that? - Yes. - Yeah? Promise? I know you can. Come here. I love you, buddy. I really do. All right. I'll be back. I'm comin' back, I promise. You better. I love you. - I love you too. - Be careful. Please be careful. Hey, hun. What you drawing there? - This is our house, you, and me, and daddy. - Oh yeah, but wait a minute. What's wrong with our heads there? - Those are our funny masks. - Oh, I see. Well, it's coming along nicely. - When can I go outside to play? - I'm really sorry, honey, but we can't go outside right now. We have to wait until things get better out there, okay? - How long will that take? - Well, I don't really know, but how 'bout this? In the meantime, you can draw me another picture, of a robot. - Yes. - I know they're you're favorite. Boom, pow, bam. Pow. - I'm here to protect you from the bad guys. - Well, I'm feeling safer already, but I can't help but feel a little underdressed. - Well, here's your armor. - Oh, thank you. And here's your weapon. - Thank you, Sir Riley. - Argh, matey. There be a rough sea ahead. - Ay, but Captain Riley, where be the buried treasure? - Over there. But it's guarded by a pumpkin head and his sidekick. You'll never get pumpkin-head's treasure. - Riley, take that off right now. - I'm sorry, mommy. I was just playing. - No, I'm sorry, honey. I didn't mean to yell. I just really don't like that mask, okay? It's too scary. Will you put it back in the box, please? - What are these for? I want you to hold on to them. In case things get bad. - Take that. Blow, I blowed your house up. Oh, yes, I blew your other house up. What are you doing, mommy? - I just need to go outside to get more food for us. - But I'm scared. - Oh, honey, don't be scared. It'll be all right. - But you're not gonna come home, like daddy. - Yes I am, honey, I promise. I'm coming back. I just, I really need you to be brave right now, okay? It's really important. Can you do that for mommy? Come here. Oh, honey. Oh, honey. I love you more than anything, okay? Oh, god. It'll be okay, I promise, okay? It'll be okay. - Mommy, I'm scared. When are you and daddy coming home? - Oh, no. Oh my god. Oh my god. Okay. Okay. - Please. You have to help me. - Oh my god. What happened to you? - Derek. He just, oh god. My brother Derek and I were looking for a place to camp, and it just came out of nowhere. Derek shot at it, but it just kept coming, and the, I could hear him screaming. Even through his mask I could hear it. I just sat here. I just sat here and listened to my brother get torn apart. - Can you walk? - My leg, it's not good. - I'm sorry. I have a son. - Fuck! You can't leave me here. Come back. No, please. Come back. - Ow. Let's see what we've got. - Can we listen to Santa music, mommy? - You know what? I think we might be able to do that. Let me see. All right, let's see this. All right, and it sounds. Good? All right, fingers crossed. Oh. I'm sorry, hun, there's no batteries. I don't know what to tell you. Okay. Let's see if that works. There we go. - And there. - All right. - And there. And in the middle, there. All right. - And down here. Okay. Take that. Last one, okay. Yeah. Good job. - It's perfect. - Yes it is, but, mister, you better start your letter to Santa, because it's Christmas Eve already. - Yes. Done. But how do we get it to the North Pole without the mailman? - Well, I know a very special way, but you have to write, "To the North Pole" on the outside of the letter, so it doesn't get lost. Okay, well, normally we would need a chimney to do this, but I think this is gonna work out just fine. Okay, can you hold that? And get a match. All right. You ready for this? You know, it is Christmas Eve. How would you like to open one present? - Yes. It's Melvin. You found him. - Well, he is your favorite, right? Yeah, he's the boss of the toxic crusaders. - Oh wow. Merry Christmas, honey. I love you. - I love you too. - You know, I have one more surprise. I hope you saved room for dessert. - Cookies! - Those are all for you, honey. - I'm not gonna stop fighting until you lose and I win. Hah! - Hey, hey honey? It's time for bed, okay? We need to get to sleep or Santa's not gonna come. - Can Melvin come too? - Um, I think we can make some room for a crusader. - He's a toxic crusader. - Well, I think we could make room even for a toxic crusader, okay? Let's get to bed. - Do you think Santa will be able to find us down here? - Of course I do, honey. Santa's magic. He can find us no matter where we are, okay? So don't even worry about that. In the morning, when you wake up, you're gonna have so many toys and so many presents you're not gonna know where to start. - Will daddy be there too? - Yeah, yeah. And daddy'll be there when we wake up, and we'll all be together again. And it'll be just like it used to be, okay? Get some sleep. - I love you, mommy. - I love you too. I love you too honey. Sleep tight. Don't let the bed bugs bite. How did you get this much fuzz all over you? What were you doing, rolling on the floor? No. Can you, can you, like, sit up? What do you think, it's 111, 112? Degrees in here? Oh my god, seriously? - That's normal, right? - Right, can you, can you work with me here? Just, can you sit up straight please? Can't we just get this done? - Come on guys, get it together. - I don't wanna wear this anymore. - Look, granny spent a lot of time making this for you, so you're gonna wear it and your gonna like it, you understand? - But it's itchy. - Look, I know. I know it's itchy. Come on, we gotta get this picture taken for granny, and then we're done and it's over and that's it. - Yeah, and we'll never hear the end of it. - Seriously? - No, no. - I can't. - I didn't say a word. - Ow. - Oh boy, don't you look festive. - Okay. - Wow. - But I still think there's something missing. I know. - Now what is this? Oh, god, come on. - What do you think, mom? Has dad been naughty or nice? - Don't do this. - Oh, sounds naughty to me. What do you think? - Naughty. - Come on, man, no. - Let's see, yeah, definitely, definitely naughty, yeah. - That's fine. That's good. - Yeah, definitely naughty. Okay. This is fine. - Go. - Got some hair there. Perfect. - This is a good time in the day. - Okay, and, move that here, - Put that there. Maybe can you move a little bit for me, please? - Here we go. - Just, yeah. - All right, great. - Thank you. - Grandma's gonna see my shirt, too. Okay. Ready? - Okay, so on the count of three, I want everybody to say, "Merry Christmas," okay? One, two, three. Merry Christmas. And just one more. One, two, three. Merry Christmas. - All right, I think we got some really good ones. Just hang tight. I'm gonna go print one out and we can check on 'em. - See, that's it. We survived. It wasn't so bad. - Oh no, aside from my pride taking a hit, this was wonderful. - All right, ow. And you gotta seat all to yourself now. Man, that's a bony butt. Ow. Ah, all right, well, I think we should get the deluxe package. But is that gonna be enough wallets? - Oh, I don't know. I mean, unless you plan on handing them out at a baseball game, I think a hundred's okay. - Ha, ha. And I really like both of those Christmas borders. I wonder if I can get two different ones for the cards. Where is she? Excuse me. - I have your picture. Here. You have such a lovely family. That's perfect. Hold that pose. - Mommy, mommy, Santa came, Santa came. - Simon? Riley, come over here right now. - Santa? - Riley, now. - Please, please just let me die. No! No. Riley? Riley? No, Riley. No. No! No! No! Oh, my baby. Come on. Wake up. You wake up. No! No, baby! Riley! My baby. Wails No!
