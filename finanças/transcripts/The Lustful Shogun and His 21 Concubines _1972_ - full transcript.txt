Edo Castle also contains the memories of countless human struggles. Ero Shogun to Nijuichi Nin no Aisho THE LUSTFUL SHOGUN AND HIS 21 CONCUBINES Screenplay by SUZUKI Noribumi & KAKEFUDA Masahiro Cast IKE Reiko HAYASHI Shinichiro EMA Ryoko MIURA Natsuko WATANABE Yayoi NAWA Hiroshi ABE Toru SUGIMOTO Miki Directed by SUZUKI Noribumi Year Two of Anei Era (1773), October 5... In the home of Hitotsubashi Haruzumi, the Minister of Justice... his son Toyochiyo was born. According to ancient legends a boy born during a solar eclipse will obtain untold luxury. Around the same time Toyochiyo was born... another child was born in a poor farmer's home in the Echigo region. The boy is Kakusuke, the son of Bakuro Saisuke. Push! He's out. Kakusuke with born holding a kyotai, what we now call a condom. Perhaps for that reason... he showed an extreme interest towards women at a young age. By age eight, he knew everything about the vagina. He worked day and night to investigate the act of sex. No, I won't do it until I get married! Okiku, stop being so stubborn. The more you do it, the better it feels. Okiku, this'll be the last night we spend together. Where are you going? I'm going to Edo. I gonna be a successful man. Oh, rice cake! Yummy! Tastes so good! Okiku, let me taste you too. No, not until you marry me! What kind of son of Bakuro Saisuke are you? How dare you touch my daughter! KAKUSUKE, 15 YEARS OLD Kakusuke, make sure you write me once you arrive in Edo, okay? When you become successful, let me go Edo too, alright? Of course. Kakusuke who is fully interested in sex... Ieft for Edo in order to fulfill his wish to become the master of sex. Meanwhile, Hitotsubashi Toyochiyo became a man with wide knowledge. His intelligence was so high, he was considered a child prodigy. He studied day and night and was never lazy. Even the greatest scholars were stunned by Toyochiyo's intelligence. He was even talked about in Edo Castle. Hitotsubashi Toyochiyo should be the only one to be considered... ...to succeed as the eleventh Shogun. A man who the stand at the top of Tokugawa house... must have a clear head... as well as the guts to get through chaotic political storms. But what about his martial art skills? Matsudaira Sadanobu is more capable in both literary and military arts. Besides, he's the eighth Shogun Yoshimune's grandson. He's related by blood. Tokugawa now needs younger fresher blood! Sir. Tanuma, you're being unreasonable. There must be something else behind your intention. Shut up! With everyone's different opinions, the meeting went on to midnight. As a result... SYMPTOMS OF SENILE DEMENTIA TENTH SHOGUN, TOKUGAWA IEHARU Your Highness, regarding the successor of the Shogunate... Please make your decision as soon as possible. Madam Oyae... You're the closest person to His Highness. You must be able to know how he thinks. Could you please ask for his words? Certainly. Your Highness... I see. Sir Tanuma, His Highness has given me his word. Toyochiyo... I see, Your Highness. Please listen. His Highness has made his decision. The 11th Tokugawa Shogun will be Toyochiyo of the Hitotsubashi Family. Wait a second! Sir Tanuma, we'll know that His Highness is suffering from senile dementia. I doubt his judgement. Quiet! I won't allow your disrespectful words towards His Highness. Oh, Your Highness... Your Highness... The decision has been made, thanks to Lord Tanuma's string pulling. Kamon, where is Toyochiyo? Well... As usual, he's in his room and won't step out. Young lord, you've studied more than enough. You've got to at least know things between men and women. I do know. Young lord, you've only learned from books. If you still have no idea about women... you cannot behave well as the Shogun! I've read all about it from books. Then let me ask you. Where do babies come from? What? You don't even know that? It's common sense. Babies are brought by storks. She's known as Nezumikozo (rat kid) in Edo. She's evetywhere, but no where to be found. Stealing money from the rich and giving to the poor. A lone chivalrous thief who stands out from others thieves. Okichi... What you doing? Keep washing me. Okichi, you always look so good. Okichi, I'll wash your body today, okay? Get lost! It's my turn today. Shut up! Who cares about you! Stop it already. I want to wash you so much that... Get lost! Okichi... Thank you but I'll help myself. Thanks. Okichi... I'm still waiting for your reply from the other day. Oh, that... Sorry but I don't think so. I've decided to stay single forever. Okichi, then how about you let me once... Please! No. I don't like men. Only once, what's the big deal? Okichi, just once... I'm the same age as Toyochiyo. How could we be so different? Good question. The Shogun gets everything he wants. I wish things could be different. If I were allowed in the Ooku... it'll be heaven. If you go there, not even a female cat would fall for you. Why don't you go to a whorehouse? This is a young lord of an important family. You will help him lose his virginity. Yes, please count on me. I'm very good at this. What is this bean-like thing? It's a living bean too. That bean might be small now. But if you "simmer" slowly, it'll get bigger and bigger. So what kind of bean is it? A soybean, a pea, or a green bean? Mine is a "happiness bean." What is that? This is how you make it taste good. You simmer it slowly. When it's well simmered, you put a matsutake mushroom in it. Beans with matsutake mushrooms? What a bad combination. I won't allow that on my table. Stop! What are you doing? Now is the time to eat my bean! Get off me! Stop it! Kamon! Kamon, help! I don't like your happiness bean! You're being too rough! How dare you treat him this way! He's the one who will become the eleventh Shogun! What? Eleventh Shogun? Ouch! Ouch! Food poisoning! Food poisoning! TANUMA Has Toyochiyo been separated yet? Their bodies haven't been separated for three days now. Not yet? That's ridiculous. The Shogun succession ceremony is the day after tomorrow. By then, you must put him into Edo Castle. But I'm not sure... You fool! My plan of concentrating the Shogunate's power to myself must play out. Miyamoto, if you can't follow my instruction... it'll be the end of your path to a better career. You can't even kill a dog with such child's play. Besides, if you killed me... trouble will come to your Lord Tanuma. If Toyochiyo is "sick," someone else will succeed as the 11th Shogun. So I'll make a deal. If you agree, I'll make Toyochiyo succeed as scheduled. Woman. You're Nezumikozo, who stirred up all of Edo, aren't you? Who knows. I can't compare to Sir Kubo. But one thing's for sure. You and Narita are much dirtier than me. Wait. She's made an offer. Let's hear it. KAKUSUKE Hmm, he looks just like Toyochiyo. Let me see. A mirror-image of Toyochiyo. Can't tell the difference. Sir Tanuma, I can talk him out if you wish. Only a temporary thing. Only until Toyochiyo recovers from his wired illness. I'll pay a hundred ryo for this. No, it'll be a thousand ryo. A thousand? Sir Tanuma, you're at the edge of losing the game. Now's not the time to be cheap. Well, Kakusuke, you look like someone from a rich family now. Really, Okichi? You'll really marry me if I do you this favor, right? Of course. You can do whatever to my body as you please. If this is a dream, I don't wanna wake up. Hey listen, Kakusuke! From this day, you are Ienari, the 11th Tokugawa Shogun. You're the master of 300 beautiful women in the Ooku. Thank you so much. I really appreciate it. No need to thank me like that. From now on... You will straighten your back, be more confident, and talk less. Understood? Yes. Okichi, do you think I can really handle this? You'll be fine. You were the most popular actor in your village play, right? When you don't know what to do... just say "Do whatever you think is right." "Insolent! How dare you!" Those two sentences will do. Do whatever you think is right! The Seven Year of Tenmei Era (1787), July... Toyochiyo succeeds as Tokugawa Ienari, the 11th Tokugawa Shogun. Show your respect to the new Shogun! Everyone, raise your heads. I will now succeed as the 11th Tokugawa Shogun. Following Tokugawa Founder Ieyasu's lineage and his wishes... I will build a peaceful country for our people. Good job. You act very well as the Shogun. Relax. You may come closer. Silence! Restrain yourself! I can enter the Ooku tonight, right? I'll handle that well. That's what I'm good at. Fool! You're not allowed in the Ooku yet. You're kidding me. You promised. Don't rush yourself. It's a rule that a new Shogun cannot visit the Ooku within the first 9 days. How frustrating not be able to taste the goodies in front of me. I wonder what kind of person the new Shogun is? How good is he at love making? Otoyo... My mistress... Oh, you should be with a man. Indeed... You're driving me crazy. Nezumikozo! Okichi! What's going on? What is a noble man like you doing here? What you doing dressed like that, Okichi? What if someone mistakens you as Nezumikozo? No, you're not... What? Well, I'm who you think I am. Why is a pretty woman like you Nezumikozo? Behind so called peaceful country... many people are crying. Even in these posts and walls... ...are filled with the blood and hatred of peasants who died. With one drought after another... rice fields dried out and no rice was produced. But they were still taxed. For those peasants, my father became the leader of an uprising. But there was no way to beat the Shogunate. Eventually they were defeated and burned to death. I was only five at the time. I was raised by a peasant. Farmers grow rice but they don't have any rice to eat. I'll live as a thief for the rest of my life. For now, I'll steal all the money in this Edo Castle. I'm also dreaming that... someday this castle will be burned down by the torches that peasants throw. Okichi... I don't understand well, but... I just like you so much. I wish this castle were burned down to ashes! His Highness is here! Hey, how are you doing? You must not have been fed well. I'll give you more than enough "nutrition." Beautiful... Indeed. You've been selected for tonight. Thank you. I cannot be happy enough to... No, not you. Your not like her. I meant the young one next to you. Come here. Hurry up. Yes. What you doing? Hurry up. Your name is Omiyo, right? Yes. I've been waiting for you. Oh, you're such a pretty one. So pretty... So pretty. I'm gonna eat you up. Beautiful. Hey, what's wrong? What? Sleeping already? You haven't been careful enough. What are you doing? Your Highness... Don't look. Oh, you've been using this. Why were you using that in front of me? No, Your Highness... Oh, you look delicious. And I'm still "hungry." I want more. Your Highness, I couldn't be more happy. Oh, that was yummy. Hey, come here. Your Highness, what you trying to do? Relax, relax. Your Highness... Oh, the third one still feels good. Your Highness... I'm so happy. That was good too. Now, for number four... Maybe not. Your Highness, a couple of things that need your attention. This matter hadn't been settled when our last Shogun was alive. Regarding whether the Takahata Clan should... keep receiving their125,000 koku stripend. How should we handle this matter? Do whatever you think is right. You mean they should keep receiving it? Yeah, whatever you think is right. I see. Next. Regarding the repairs needed on our premises. Should we allow it? Well, do whatever you think is right. Well, Your Highness is such a brilliant man. Determination and action are the essence of politics. Your Highness has made great decisions. By the way... Didn't you oppose to the suggestion that I should succeed as Shogun? No, I certainly did not. I have another matter that needs Your Highness' attention. It is presented by Onagu. Hope you'll like it. Your Highness, please taste evetywhere of me, Shunkei. If you do so, this bud will blossom. This little bird will sing. This red peony will be on fire. Even this snake will stick out its red tongue... ...and will keep writhing day and night. Your Highness! Onagu, your gift was wonderful. I enjoyed it. Your Highness, what are you doing? I need a snack after having such a heavy meal. Your Highness, please let go of me. I'm a concubine of our last Shogun. I can't betray him. Relax, relax. See, you're getting wet. Please let me go. It's the rules. Don't worry. I'll make new rules. He'll be glad, too. No, you can't! Your Highness... Please don't stop! I have sinned. I'm going to hell for this. I can hardly breathe. Oman, I want to be promoted to the higher rank of Roju. To accomplish that, I need to take control Shogun's wife and concubines. I'm depending on you, Oman. I want to be better off than Oraku too. People are even betting who will become the next supervisor of the Ooku. Don't worry. I'll give His Highness a good word about you. So, you've got to listen to what I say, okay? I will do whatever you say. But you're a heartless man. What you saying? You're going to marry Sir Tanuma's daughter, aren't you? Fool. She's just a tool for my future success. Oman... But this "tool" only belongs to you. So, why exactly have I been called to Edo Castle? My family was stunned. Don't be. Well, His Highness is an very sympathetic man. He wanted to hear directly from peasants about their sufferings. He said that there should be a girl like you in Echigo Region... and ordered to bring you here. His Highness is here! Here he is. Gather. I want to talk to this peasant woman. Everyone else is excused. Yes, sir. Raise your head. Relax. Raise your head. Your Highness, if I look at your face, aren't my eyes going to be crushed? Hey, Okiku. Hey, I'm Kakusuke. I wanted to do what I promised you. I wanted you to see the inside of this castle for once. I'm kind of scared. Kakusuke, go back home with me. I can't. I have a different status now. What are you talking about? You said you were only a double. You're right, but... I now have the responsibilities to the people. I wish I could stay as the Shogun for a long time. Besides, I'm doing well as the Shogun. No complaints. Idiot. You'll face the consequences someday for getting carried away! Insolent! How dare you! Okiku, after you looked around the castle, go back home. Kakusuke, will you let me stay? What? You? I'm worried about you. So I want to stay here and look after you. Make me a servant and let me stay beside you. Alright, determination and action! I'll make you to an Osei under Oman's supervision. What's an Osei? Fool, a female servant is called that in the castle. I can't believe that he used to be a peasant. He may just be gifted in acting. He is of a low-class family after all. It must be too much to handle for the women. But at least no one could tell he's a fake. How's Toyochiyo doing? He's been recovering with our good care. But he's showing intensive fear towards women's private parts. What trouble. Let's switch them tomorrow. Toyochiyo's future wife Princess Shigeko... Minister of the Right, Fujiwara Tsuneaki's daughter... has left Kyoto and is heading to Edo already. And what's the plan? The customary event of a Noh play and interlude will take place tomorrow. Put Toyochiyo among the Noh actors and get him inside of the castle. I'll tell Kakusuke to get lost. There's another one who knows the secret... That "Nezumi" (rat). Bunch of cowards. Whose pet dogs are you? Go after her! Finally showed your teeth. You're asking for it. We'll see who outsmarts who. What's this money for? Your acting job is over now. What? That's it? That's too soon. Please let me do it a little longer. Stop your jokes. Enough for your outrageous behavior. That's too bad. There's a few more women I didn't do yet. Besides, politics is getting interesting to me as well. I've been improving... Fool! From now on, you're back to being the bath servant you used to be. But what did Okichi say? Don't mention her! Just looking at your face makes me sick! Blend in with the actors and get out of the castle! We've got trouble! What? Toyochiyo has disappeared. No where to be found. What? Are you sure? Well, I'm off. Wait! Wait! What is it? Don't you get sick by just looking at my face? Well, just don't go yet. I need you to stay for now. I'm not happy today! Cancel the Noh and interlude play! Your Highness... Your Highness... What happened? Tanuma, that bastard, upset me! Your Highness, please feel better. Insolent! How dare you! What happened to Kakusuke's brain? He used to be crazy about women. And all of sudden, he's only into books. What the hell is going on? I can't believe that Okichi paid 10 ryo to take care of him. You're stupid, brother. Kakusuke is insane now. What's gonna happen if he goes out on the street? Right? The Seven Year of Tenmei Era, October... Shigeko, Minister of the Right Fujiwara Tsuneaki's daughter... arrived in Edo from Kyoto. Since the third Tokugawa Shogun... it's been a custom to for Tokugawa Shogun... to take wives from the country's capital Kyoto. Tokugawa's wife must be of one of the royal or high-ranking official families. The purpose is to blend royal and noble blood into the Tokugawa's... according to the Tokugawa Chronicles. What are you saying? You're telling us to delay the wedding? That's unacceptable. I understand why you're upset. But we have some serious difficulties... Is Shogun Ienari unsatisfied with the Princess? No, it's nothing like that. Then why is he trying to avoid the Princess? Yukioka, that's enough. I'll follow the Shogun's decision. I'm no longer the daughter of the Minister of the Right. Princess Shigeko... Sir Tanuma, I will follow your word. Please also say hello to Shogun Ienari. I miss our village in Echigo. They must be busy now with the rice harvest. Without your help, my family must've been having a hard time. Don't worry. Okiku, wanna be my concubine? It'll be an easy life for you. No, I don't like concubines. I would rather be a wife of a poor man. You're a woman with no greed. I brought rice cakes for you. Your favorite, right, Kakusuke? You're a sweet girl. Yummy? Yeah. I made them. Really? Make some more. Don't know about that. Kakusuke... Who's the bride who just came from Kyoto? I don't really want to talk about it. She's for the real Shogun. That was easy to find. But I have to think how to get these out of the castle. I'm not the same kind of woman as Oman. What do you want? Leave that aside. If you and I could cooperate, anything is possible. You're thinking about eventually killing Sir Tanuma anyway, aren't you? If so, you're going to leave Kakusuke as the Shogun. If you know how to use that dummy, you'll rise as much as you desire. I want to get into the Ooku. To take care of that bath servant? Why, are you jealous? He's the Shogun right now. Just to whisper my words of wisdom to his ear when needed. I think I'm a better candidate than Oman in assisting you... since I know the entire plot Woman, you're not just a rat after all. No, I'm only a rat. Beautiful... With your beauty, His Highness will fall for you in no time. I never thought you would come here. Well, you've made me wait enough. Wait a second. You promised you wouldn't. Kaku, I heard you still haven't had that princess yet? No. What are you waiting for? Just do her. Noble and low-class women are all the same. Alright! Determination and action. His Highness is here! Oh my, with no prior notice at all... I've decided to sleep here tonight. Your Highness, according to Sir Tanuma... Forget about that. Relax. I'm Shogun Ienari. You must be tired. I love you until your bones melt tonight. All dismissed. What's this? That's... I see. You've been learning everything. I guess you know no less than I do. I'll teach you much more than these drawings. I'm not done preparing myself. Relax. Oh my, you're a strong man. When I was twelve, I could easily carry a straw rice bag on my shoulder. Your Highness, you'll treat me very well, right? Of course. Smells good. One of noble family is different. What? That bastard! I heard he showed up in her bedroom all of sudden and insulted the bride. Unforgivable! In only two months, he's had in total of 17 women already! The pregnancy rate is extremely high too. 14 women are already pregnant. Bastard, getting himself with more and more power. If we let him keep going, he'll be more kids than any other Shogun had. Miyamoto, still no clue about where Toyochiyo is? His family is trying their best to find him, but unfortunately no word yet. We've got to do something now. Or we're over. The next year, the Eighth Year of Tenmei Era (1788), February... An emissary from Qin visited. Relations between China and Japan were on the raise. My name is Mao Taku-san. MAO TAKU-SAN My name is Chin Man-ko. CHIN MAN-KO Chin Man-ko and Mao Taku-san. Both of them are from Qin but also know our language. I learned Japanese in Osamanbe of Hokkaido. I learned Japanese from a guy in Kawachi of Osaka. Anyway, bring the gifts prepared for His Highness. What is that? A kind of animal called Panta. Panta? Both have been well-trained with special techniques. They'll be the best pets for women. They're called Panta. Just say "panta lon" when you want them to come out. Panta's tongue will make women moan and go crazy. It'll be an experience that she'll never forget for the rest of her life... according to this Collection of Sayings. You can find it on Page 56. Give that Panta to whoever. Why do you give our women toys? Your Highness, the more of a sleeping beauty she is, the more she wants it. What? Sleeping beauties? To satisfy both a man and a woman, words are important. You're right. I will simultaneous interpret what this woman says. I see. Now, I'll show a Japanese man's techniques of Determination and Action. Xie-xie. "Come on, darling." What did she say? So wonderful! I want more... More kiss...here... It's so good. It's so good, the best. So good. Oh, great. I'm in heaven. Why did I know such a great thing like this? Wow, great. It's hitting me, hitting me. What's this hitting me? Oh, this's great. Oh, I'm coming... coming... Darling, more... My dear... More... more... Yes... Oh, I'm coming... Hurry... Don't tell me that. His Highness has allowed it. Sir Chin Man-ko! Come on, let's hurry. But actually I... Let's go. Chin Man-ko! No violence! What's wrong with you! I'm not good enough for you? No... Chin Man-ko, what's wrong? I... I... You don't like her? No, not that. I don't have my... thing. You don't have the symbol of manhood? In our country, if you want to work as a Huanguan in the emperor's palace... your thing will be cut off right away. Instead, Huanguan can become extremely powerful. Huanguan? Someone like me who's born of a poor family... has to do whatever is necessary to become successful! It must be inconvenient for you. It is. Without it, I don't feel like a man. It's like I don't have much strength down here. Even when I'm walking, it's hard to balance myself. Whenever I look at this thing, I'm so ashamed of myself. Feel so sorry for myself. What is that? This used to be part of me. I have to show this as identification when I get promoted. By the way, it looks so small. No... That's because it's all dried up. Before this was cut off, it was much bigger. Used to be the best in my village. Chin, what the hell are you doing to my identification? Chin, stop licking! Stop! That's right. The Tokugawa should employ the Huanguan System as well. That's a great idea! Our culture is based on Qin culture. Your Highness, let's implement this system right away. Sugimoto, you're absolutely right. Is that what you really thing? Yes, from all of my heart. Really? Then you'll be the first Huanguan. What? Me? Your Highness, please don't... I've got to discuss with my wife. Quiet! Determination and action! According to the Collection of Sayings... The Huanguan Ceremony. The removed unit will be contained in this box. Sugimoto, I'm very pleased with your loyalty! Now, I have no need to be ashamed even if I meet the Emperor of Qin. Your Highness... Now... Going in. One, two, three... Oh, I've been waiting for you. Relax, come closer. I've just been discussing loyalty with everyone. I have no need to doubt your loyalty, correct? Of course not. For Your Highness... I wouldn't even think twice to giving my own life. Is that so? Will you then let me borrow your wife for one night? Your Highness... I would rather you didn't ask me that. No, I want to hear your answer to my request. Your Highness... If someone as low as my wife.... You know what I really want from you. I want you to show me your loyalty to me. Wow, you're young. Tanuma is a lucky man. Let's begin. Your Highness, please let her go. My mother has just married 6 months ago. She's still too young. You're Tanuma's daughter? Yes. My name is Oino. You're to be married to the Iwamoto Family, right? Yes. Please let my mother go. I've come to accept Tanuma's loyalty. You'd better watch too. Oino, watch! Oino, don't look away! Oino! Watch carefully! Please don't. I'm still a virgin. That's why I've got to teach you. No! But why are you already wet? I can't... I'll get pregnant... Don't worry. I'll make sure you won't. Your Highness, you seem tired. Please take care of your own health. Are you being jealous? No, I'm not. You're my child's most important man. What? Your Highness, please touch here. You're pregnant? Yes. That's great! If it's a boy, he'll be the twelfth Shogun. That's right. I'll name him Kakuchu. Kakusuke, wake up from your dream! Wake up from your bad dream! That would be the end of this act. Please go back to our village with me, okay? Kakusuke, let's go back to our hometown. Kakusuke! Let go of me! How dare you touch me! Behave yourself! Kakusuke! Have you gone mad? Idiot! Idiot! Don't touch me! Arrest her! Let go! Kakusuke, let's go back to our hometown together! Kakusuke! How insolent! I'm the Shogun. The Ooku and Edo Castle are all under my control. Damn it. We need to get rid of him as soon as possible. Please watch our 'new faces' dance! New idea for this year. Enjoy to your fullest. Listen. The first one who falls on the floor will be punished. Let's begin! How do you write "like?" You write "woman" and "child." How do you write "woman?" You write "ku," "no," and "ichi." How do you write "child?" In the middle of "woman," a thick, thick pole goes in. It feels so good. How do you write "like?" You write "woman" and "child." How do you write "woman?" You write "ku," "no," and "ichi." How do you write "child?" What a tough woman. You'll see how quickly I make you moan. How do you write "like?" You write "woman" and "child." How do you write "woman?" You write "ku," "no," and "ichi." How do you write "child?" That's it for you. I'll award you with something extraordinary. Panta. How dare you go against Panta that I borrowed from His Highness! Your Highness... Okiku... Okiku... Who? Who did this to Okiku? Okiku... Sir... Madam Oman abused her at the Shinzanmai. What? Madam Oman? Unforgivable. Have her banished from the Ooku right now! Sir Iwamoto, please. Please talk His Highness out of the banishing me. Since I listened to you, now I'm ruined. I told you to get rid of her without anyone else knowing. I want to help you, but there's nothing I can do. You got me into this trouble, and now you won't help me? Coward. If I'm ruined, you will be too! Have you lose your mind? Someone... Someone please help! Sir Iwamoto, what's the matter all of a sudden? How dare you hurt someone in front of His Highness! Shut up! I only killed somone who's gone insane. Sir Iwamoto, seems like you've come to the end. Your Highness, he's the one who drove Okiku to commit suicide. Please execute your authority. What? He put his hand on Madam Oman... and ordered her to kill Okiku to keep the secret safe. Bastard, I order you to commit Seppuku! What the hell? How dare you attack His Highness! Seppuku! You're going to commit Seppuku! You're a bath servant! You're only an imposter! How dare you order me around! Insolent! You're just a bath servant! That's who you really are! A bath servant! Kill! Kill him! Your Highness! Madman! Kill! Kill! I'm the Shogun. Not a bath servant. I'm not some servant dog! I am the Shogun! I'm the eleventh Tokugawa Shogun! Shogun! How are you feeling? You're sweating so much. I have official affairs to take care of. I have responsibilities as the Shogun! Your health is more important than that! Please calm down. I can't. I have worry about the people. A Shogun should please the people! I'll announce a new law to my people. Your Highness! This is my order to every official. Gather all prisoners to the Edo Castle! Including those who are to be executed! In the name of the Tokugawa, I'm going to implement a new law! Get inside! Sit! Sit down! Quiet! What the hell is this all about? His Highness ordered us to gather all prisoners here. What? His Highness' order? This is a report from the Hitotsubashi Family's doctor's record. Sir Toyochiyo does not have a mole on his face. Your Majesty, the so-called Shogun is an imposter. He's only a bath servant called Kakusuke. What makes you say that? I was the one who staged this whole thing from the beginning. I can hand over the real Toyochiyo as long as you agree to do one thing. What is it? In exchange for the real one, I want the 10 million ryo in the storage. I'm only a wife. You have the wrong person to negotiate. I'm only saying this because you're not officially married yet. You're the only one who can save the Tokugawa now. Considering the Tokugawa's 8 million koku stripend each year... I think it's pretty cheap. All right, I agree to your condition. Good. The money is to be carried out in large chests when you go visit Kanei Temple. I'll then return Toyochiyo to you in one of those chests. Listen, I'm the 11th Shogun, Tokugawa Ienari! I am announcing a new law to you. This new law is to be implemented not only in Edo but all over the country. Anyone can have sex with another without boundaries of social status. No need to worry about anything. Bath servants, farmers and prisoners, no matter what you are... From this moment on, anybody can go into the Ooku! It's a party for everyone today! Go to the Ooku and fuck a woman! Everyone who fucks a woman will be released from prison! No! There are serious offenders among them who organized peasant uprisings! Even many political criminals! So what? What's wrong with peasant uprisings? Everyone, go into the Ooku. Have sex with women! Stop! Stop them! Your Highness. Your Highness... Your Highness, you're the most competent and wise Tokugawa Shogun ever. Help me... Your Highness... Kakusuke stopped breathing while making dazzling love to Okichi. Next day, the line of chests contained 10 million ryo arranged by Shigeko... headed towards Kanei Temple. The shameful secret about the eleventh Tokugawa Shogun... ...whom Shigeko married is forever being buried. Tanuma who used to have enormous power lost his political position. Toyochiyo became the owner of the Ooku with its 3000 beauties. However, Toyochiyo did not have luck of making his own children. No one knows that... Toyochiyo's 54 children were created by Kakusuke's seed... with his 21 loved mistresses. But there was no Okichi on record. It's been said that other mistresses... not mentioned in the Tokugawa Chronicles, totaled more than 50 women. The Twelfth Year of Tenpo Era (1841), on February 27th... the eleventh Tokugawa shogun, Tokugawa Ienari, passed away. He was 69 years old.
