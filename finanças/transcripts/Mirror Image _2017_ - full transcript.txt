[ominous boom] [waves crashing] [ominous orchestral music] [muffled screams] [muffled screams] [muffled screams] [breathes heavily] [screams] [screams] [dramatic orchestral music] - [Jessica] Somebody help me! Help me! Help me! Somebody help me! [ominous orchestral music] [glass shatters] [dramatic orchestral music] [Alex gasps] - My scalpel seems to have dulled. - That's a bit foreboding. You and dad did always have a backup plan. - Yes, actually your father was the one who got me in the habit of purchasing these pricey pens. Forced us into caring if we actually lost one. - It also made something as simple as writing even more stressful to him. - And more pleasurable. He'd be very proud of the progress you've made. - Progress? We've had months of memory regression, therapy. We have no idea why he killed Jayden, and why he let me live. - Now, Jess you... You may never know. Trauma affects the mind. But sometimes the mind protects itself from memories, so we can heal. You're alive. The voices are gone. That's all that matters. - Is that my uncle speaking, or my doctor? - You know, we could droll around that head of yours for years, and never get the answers that you're looking for. It's time to accept, and move on. - So now what? - Well you're not my prisoner, but you've been released into my care, and that's something I take very seriously. Lindsey said something about coming to our beach house, I think that's a good idea. - I wanna go home. - Oh no, no, I don't think that's the healthiest idea, I really don't. - You said you trust me, Uncle Alex. That I'm well enough to go. I do know I'm gonna find awful memories when I get back there. But they're my memories. I just want 'em back. [ominous orchestral music] They also said that... - Sit up straight. Continue. - All I need to do is find a place to live by the 5th of August. That's it. - Do you see, this is why your father and I, Lord rest his soul, pushed you girls so hard. You will make us proud, won't you? - Of course, mother. - That's my good girl. Have you told Jayden? - Not yet. It might be kind of hard on her. They told her no. She hasn't really found a place that's gonna work yet. - Well you have more talent than she does. That's something she's going to accept. - You call me twice a day. [laughs] - Thank you, Uncle Alex. - Noon, and six. - I promise. - Updates on meds. - Letter of the law. Yes. - I don't like this. But... If you're going to do it, and I know you are, remember one thing. Nobody can change the past, not you, not me, not even God. [ominous orchestral music] [speaking inaudibly] [cheering inaudibly] [waves crashing] [gentle orchestral music] [phone rings] - Watts. - Hey, Bill, it's Alex Richie. - Jesus Christ, don't tell me they assigned you to my case. - No, but I heard about your loss. And your suspension. You know Ogden Edwards was a decent man, when he worked for my family. - Yeah, Ogden Edwards is a child killer. And he's a drunk, okay and if I ever catch up to him... What case are you calling me about, Alex? - It's not business. It's personal, it's about my niece. Jessica. - The twin? - Yeah, she just left my office. She wants to spend the weekend at the house on Mays. She thinks that if she can remember what happened she can put this thing to rest. Listen, Bill, my daughter is staying with her, and I just don't want anything to happen to them. - Well what are you asking me to do here, Alex? - [Alex] I want you to keep an eye on them. Just for the weekend, okay? I'll pay you. I just wanna make sure she's okay. - Well... When is she planning on leaving? - They're already on the road. - Well it doesn't leave me a lot of time. - You know how much this means to me, Bill. - [Bill] Alright, doctor, I'll be in touch. - I really wanna thank you. [somber orchestral music] - Hey, Billy. So... Amanda and Tommy really want you to come to their barbecue, on Sunday. Said you probably won't, but they'd like you to come. And Rick and I won't be there. He's hosting a tasting in Carlsbad so it's not like it'll be awkward or anything. I have an open house, in Newport, so... [somber orchestral music] - Where are the fireworks, daddy? - [Billy] You know, she still loves you, you know that Austin? She just doesn't always say it. I love you too. And when you look up at this wall, I think these skies are gonna storm. And I'll always be here. Daddy will always be here. - 533 Mays Road. Yeah, and we really don't care about the groceries, just the booze is a rush. Absolute rush, right... [distorted voices] Don't make matters worse, just bring the booze, and read the list back to me. [ominous orchestral music] This place smells. [ominous orchestral music] - Yes, mother. - We all have our burdens to bear in this life, Jayden. You remember this. [ominous orchestral music] Life's not fair. Things break, men leave. - I understand. - Drink some of your father's wine tonight. Enjoy the balcony. You have my permission. What does a good girl say when she's given a gift? - Thank you. Thank you, mother. - [Mother] See how much nicer that sounds? Mother's going to be late. - [Evil Voice] Jessica. Jessica. - I know you're just a hallucination. - [Evil Voice] Did you miss me? - You're brought on by a combination of trauma... - [Evil Voice] I'm still here. Jessica. [glass shatters] - I couldn't remember your favorite red wine, so I bought them all. Which one do you want? - Someone left a note in the door. I just had it. - What'd it say? - Canto three, line nine. - Canto, what is that, like wine or something? - No... Poetry, Italian long form. - Okay. Canto. Three. Line nine. Canto three, line nine, Dante's Inferno... [speaking in Italian] [speaking in Italian] - "Abandon hope, all ye who enter here." - Oh! Hello? Yeah, we're at the top of the hill, and it dead ends. I know because we're here, moron. No, it's clearly 533. Sounds kind of cute. He'll be fun to torture. Hey, what is wrong? - That's the inscription Dante sees when he enters hell. - Okay, so, maybe some religious nut spread notes all over the neighborhood? Who knows, who cares? - You're right. It's weird, 'cause I had it... - Listen. No one thinks clearly when they're sober, okay? So what we're gonna do is we're gonna unpack the boxes, we're gonna drink, and we are going to toast to the religious nut jobs, and their demise. [gentle jazz music] [phone vibrating] - [Kurt] Oh shoot. Shit. What the fuck is this? - Romeo. Jayden Brown, cold case files? - Hey Fanning doesn't need to know about that. - Jayden Brown. Wasn't that the case in the Hills you guys worked on? - Yeah, twins. One bound and butchered. - Isn't he on suspension? - He is. Fanning will have my ass for this. - Yeah, and such a cute ass too. Why take the risk? You know Watts is a loose cannon. - He could use a break. - Use a break? You could get busted down for this. I know Watts is your partner... How did his son get killed? - Back when Watts was working the Brown case. Carnival came to town. Had their own fireworks display. So Watts was working late, and decided to let the kid watch the show. - [Son] Where's the fireworks, daddy? - Ogden Edwards, the family groundskeeper had been drinking at the local bar. Watts had questioned him lately. Edwards lost control, and crashed his car into Watts' front yard. [car crashes] He pled not guilty. - Not guilty. - [Kurt] It was a mistrial. Edwards gets off scot-free, ups and disappears. Watts loses it, trying to find Edwards. Can't make any money for the Brown murder. They bring me on. That's when Fanning suspends him. Come on. Get dressed. I gotta figure out how to get that file. - And figure out whose these are. - So, everyone we know thinks I'm crazy, don't they? - Hey. I got you something. - Yeah? - When dad told me you were getting out, I got you this. [laughs] - My color! - [Lyndsey] Yeah, yeah. - Thank you. - [Lyndsey] You're welcome. - I'm a little out of practice. - Let me. Yeah. So, did you ever think that you weren't gonna get out? - You know, at first it was really scary, it just... Like with all the doctors, and everything. But, you know, as your dad got involved, and they finally got my medication right, it was just kind of like a summer camp. With more needles. - It's kind of like canoe camp, maybe, ninth grade? [laughs] - Okay. That's one memory I wouldn't mind forgetting. - Oh wait, so you're telling me that if you were to run into that guy, and he were to flirt with you... - He's probably, I don't know, 500 pounds by now, or something, maybe. - He is not 500 pounds. - Alright, okay. Where'd you see him? - Hush, bartender. - And I suppose you think I'm going with you tonight, huh? - I suppose I might let you go with me, stinky, if you take a shower. Or put on something that's not gonna embarrass me for once. - Hey come one, be nice. - Hey! Hey! You're messing up my artwork. That is not gonna happen. I'm so... [Jessica screams] - Don't hurt me, Lyndsey, don't hurt me! - You know, it's just a sponge, I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna hurt you. [gasps] - You know, I think going to Hush is a great idea. - Nice form, Stringer. I didn't know you could hit like that. - I'm full of surprises, captain. - Yeah? I hate fucking surprises. You know, whenever I see a detective here on his day off, I figure, he's either brown nosing, banging a broad in uniform, or being stupid by doing something he isn't supposed to be doing, you know what I mean? You don't strike me as the brown nosing type. - Working on my timing, boss. - Yeah. I'm working overtime on my timing. Timing alike. Your suspended partner hanging around the Brown residence. Yeah, the victim's uncle, the shrink? I asked him to keep an eye on the place. Nice timing, wouldn't you say? Timing like, that shrink was a suspect. Wanna tell me something, champ? - I don't know what you getting at. - Stop fucking around, Stringer. Watts head is shot, came up empty. You might say bad timing. But that case is closed. How's that for bad timing? - Some cases are never closed. - "Some cases are never closed." [laughs] I'm telling you kid. Leave it alone. We all feel bad about what happened to his kid, but, you know, he went off the deep end, that's why he got suspended. So, leave it alone. Or you'll have a lot of time to work on your timing. Comprende, Rocky? Got some high heels, don't you doll? - Got it. [mouse clicks] [phone vibrates] - Yes? - I'm sorry I called, I just... I got scared. Maybe this medication's too strong? - Listen to me, you need to stick with the program. - I'm seeing things. - What sort of things? - Bizarre things. Mirrors cracking, things that aren't even here. - Shadow man. [ominous ambient music] - No. No, he's not here. - You see? The meds are working. Listen, why don't you... Why don't I come pick you up? - No. - Stay with me for a few weeks. - No, no, uncle, I called you to tell you what's going on. Doesn't that prove that I'm better, that I can be trusted? - If you go off those meds, even for a half hour, I will leave no choice but to send you back to the institution. - I won't. - Promise? - I... I'll call you in the morning. - [Alex] Yes, but... Jess? [ominous ambient music] [mouse clicks] - What are the odds of the captain coming to the police gym, on a Sunday? - Well, apparently very high. - Who did she cross in her former life to deserve this? One day she's going off to Julliard, the next day the morgue, to see her sister. Talk about a bad week. - Then she winds up in the funny farm. - Whatever happened to tiger mom? - Dead. Heart attack. Was visiting the daughter, and drove her car out of a cliff. - Oh, god. Talk about hitting the wrong cord. When did you get assigned to the case? - When Watts' kid got killed. I came up empty too. - Is that what set him off? - I was trying to protect him. - From what? - Himself. - Yeah, well too bad you couldn't stop him from tampering with the evidence. - Hey, that guy killed a kid. - Yeah, but now Edwards is walking. - He should be buried so deep... - Hey, hey. Okay, you're starting to sound like Watts. Cool it. Okay... Alright, look, I think I got something. "The patient refuses to play, or practice her music. "Showing signs of deep remorse." - Well, I mean how do you expect her to behave after what happened to her? - I don't know, I would probably feel guilty. - Guilt. Guilt over what? - I don't know, you know. Her sister gets slashed, she's spared. I'd call it survivor's guilt. - Well that's an interesting hypothesis, Dr. Freud. - Okay, "Samples found at the scene match with the shrink." Her uncle? - He was at the opera with the mother, her sister. There were dozens of witnesses. - Well, any chance they got the time wrong? Could he have been at the house earlier? - Yeah, wife's covered that, that's in the file. - Okay, I don't know about the doctor though. I mean, if he really is clean, someone went out of their way to set him up. Real out of their way. - Are we through? - I just think that you should go back, and re-conduct all of those interviews. At least some of 'em. Just don't let Fanning catch you. Or else you're out of here. And I'd miss you. - Looks like I'm going to the funny farm. [shrubs rustle] [bottles clatter] [ominous orchestral music] - You've gotta be kidding me. [dramatic orchestral music] Hey! Damn it! [breathes heavily] [gentle piano music] [water running] - Stop it. Go away! - Obviously Jayden doesn't wanna have fun today. I do though! [gentle piano music] [ominous orchestral music] Jayden! I'm sorry. It should've been both of us, it should've been me. - It was you. [gasps] - Are you looking for me? - Please sign in detective. I'll let the doctor know you're here. - Hey, what about them? - They won't bite. - [Intercom] Dr. Davis, telephone please, Dr. Davis. Telephone, please. - You're one of the cops from the Brown murder, aren't you? Unforgettable bone structure. I saw you on the TV. - Actually my partner was the lead investigator. - The one that went crazy cuz his kid got killed? - Is that nice? - Hey, we've all got our demons. Each of us live in his or her own circle of hell. I've been here a year. I can't believe they let that Brown girl out. - You knew her? - Yeah. Every day. At Dr. Feelgood's sessions. - You mean Dr. Richie, your therapist. - The rapist? Therapist. [laughs] Therapist, rapist. That's funny. No, he wasn't into any rough stuff or weird shit. I guess that's why we played along. - Played along? - Jessica was the best at it. Or was it Jayden? Yes, Uncle Alex, no Uncle Alex. You're right, Uncle Alex. But at night, that girl was batshit crazy. - Crazy? - Those cries in the night... You're still working on that case aren't you? - Like you said, we all have our demons. - Sounds like another circle of hell. - Hey Watts, it's Fanning. I can't reach you on your cell, so I'm leaving you a message. Heard you found Ogden Edwards. Stand down. You are suspended. Don't make this worse. Stay away from him, that's an order. If you're still following orders. Get back to me, ASAP. Son of a bitch. - Jilly's pissed. She's asking why the hell I'm helping you. - What'd you tell her? - That I'm stupid. - You're loyal. - I think she agreed with stupid. - Well she doesn't know about the Aremenian girl. - We still on that? It was a fucking bachelor party, Bill. - Oh, sure. Keep your eyes on the house. - Oh, in their dresses. Looks like we're going out tonight. - Yo. It says here we got a hair sample, male, blood sample, DNA, why didn't they even look at the uncle, the Richie? - Airtight. He was at the opera with the twins' mom. Hundreds of people saw him. - Fuck opera. What does that make you think of? [camera shutter clicks] - A lunatic. Like the file says. - No. There's definitely something else going on here. Look, thanks for this. - Whatever you need, pal. - You know, there is something else. [knock on door] - Sorry to disturb you ma'am, I'm Detective Stringer. - Is everything okay? - We had reports of vagrancy in the area, breaking into homes. Just checking to see if you noticed anyone? - We just arrived this afternoon. - So it's just you two, all by yourself? - No, actually my big, mean, muscular boyfriend is gonna come, any second now, so... - You don't like me very much, do you? - Listen, pussycat, I don't like anyone who tries to download my personal information at the front door. Doesn't help that you're a cop, and neither does your breath. - Sorry to disturb you now, we're here to protect and serve. - Fuck you. [gentle orchestral music] Change that dress. Yes? - Shirt? - Come on, it looks like you're going to church, not a fucking nightclub. - It's sexy. - [Lyndsey] Whatever, we'll have fun anyway. - [Jessica] I'm showing boobs. [laughs] [energetic techno music] - Oh yeah. It's fucking fun. And Persia's working tonight, we are so hooked up. - Hey girl! How are you? - [Lyndsey] Good, how are you? Okay, two martinis. - Coming right up. - It's so good. - Lyndsey Richie? - Annalyse? - Oh my god, baby, come here. [laughs] - She is the reason that I quit ballet. That and my ass was hanging out of my tights. - Hi, I'm Jessica. - Hi, yeah, we met at one of your recitals, I think. Where's your sister? [ominous ambient music] I am the second. You are the ninth. Beat your wings. Gnash your teeth. You'll be sent to hell. [roars] [screams] [glass shatters] [cries] - Her sister was murdered. - What? Hey, are you okay? Hey, you should sit down. Come on, I have a table over here. - They're still inside. Do I wanna know? - No luck, but it's definitely the right place. Careful what you pray for, right? - Jesus Bill, don't do this to yourself. Lets do this the right way. Talk to Fanning, get you back on duty... - You know, Rita read this book. Some uplifting, upbeat bullshit, about death. And afterwards she writes this thing down for me, like I'm supposed to get something out of it, I don't know. We moved. I kept it. "Death must be so beautiful. "To lie in the soft brown earth, with grasses "waving above one's head, and listen to silence. "To have no yesterday, and no tomorrow. "To forget time, forgive life. "Be at peace. "For love is always with you. "Love is stronger than death." - That's nice. Comforting, I think. - [Bill] Think so? Know what I think? I think this world's a graveyard. And we're all just rowing along in our coffins, waiting for our bones to stop rattling. Look. Anything happens, I'm your first call, okay? - Whatever you need, pal. - [Bill] Thank you. [overlapping conversations] - Where are you from again? - Vegas. - Yeah, that's it. - We did, but... - Oh, I bet with a whole bunch of hard bodied dancers. - Yeah. Well, most of them are gay, so. - She's a little young for you. - Maybe I just don't age as well as some of your finer wines. - Yeah, and maybe she's your daughter. - Daughter? Really? Not even like sister, huh? - [Persia] Johnny. - What can I get you brother? - How about like a beer, domestic. - $12. - Everyone's gay. Except maybe that one. Hold down the fort, girls, I'm going in. - Can I ask you something? - Of course. - Does the phrase, "I am the second, "but you are the ninth, in the inner circle," mean anything to you? - No. - I thought I heard you say something like that. I'm not really used to being around a lot of people. I'm kind of on this medication, that's not really helping. - I know, I'm sorry. I know about your loss. Linzi told me before. I have two sisters, myself, and I can't even imagine if someone hurt them... - You know, honestly, the worst part is just... It's not knowing. I was actually there that night, too. But, my mom came home before he could... I'm not telling you all this for sympathy, I'm sorry. I'm just... It's really hard for me to pretend to be normal. These other people. - No one here is normal. What's normal? - Just look at all these girls. They're just... They're laughing, and having fun. - They're just wearing better masks. We don't know what's underneath. - I was right. All three were gay. I swear my gaydar is messed up, I'd probably hit on James Franco. - Well, what about that guy over there? - That's the whole reason we came here, for her. What are you waiting for, go, go, go! - [Jessica] Okay. Alright, okay. [laughs] You're on empty anyways. - What's his name? - Johnny. - Okay, act like you forgot. [laughs] - I was wondering when you were gonna come say hi, Jessica Brown. - I'm sorry, I don't remember your name. - Yeah. And I don't remember that cute little birthmark on your cheek. Right by your waistline, you know, near your hip. I'm sorry, that was totally out of line. - It's okay. It's flattering. - Are you flirting or are you working, Johnny? - Let me buy you a drink, on me, please. - Actually, I was hoping... - [Evil Voice] I never left. [eerie ambient music] - [Johnny] You okay? - Lay off the energy drinks, slut. - [Evil Voice] Jessie. Jessica. Jessie. [evil laugh] [sobs] Every shade move quickly. I see around me. - The medication's supposed to make you go away. - [Evil Voice] New torments. And new tormented souls. - Uncle Alex says you're a coping mechanism. I just utilized... - [Evil Voice] Wherever I move, and wherever I gaze. [eerie ambient music] Forsake all hope, all you that enter here. Kill. [knock on door] - Have you had any weird surgeries you had to do? Oh, hey, this is my gorgeous friend, Jessica. - Hey, this is my friend, Charlie. This is my friend, Charlie. - Charlie. Hold on. - I really, really, wanna go home. - We just got here. - I'm not feeling well, I think we should go. - Oh. Maybe Annalyse can give you a ride. - I wanna go with you. - These guys are surgeons. - Unbelievable. I... - I'll take care of her. - I'm so sorry about that guys. - So where do you need me to take you? - You know, it's okay, I'll just take a cab. - And I'll pay. I was really enjoying your company in there. - Really? - Yeah, really. - I feel like I'm a curse to everyone I meet. - Yeah, well I don't believe in curses, so come on. [Ogden mumbles] - I didn't see, I didn't... It was so dark. And I know I'm cursed, I know that... I... Every place I go, every shelter. It follows me, and everywhere I go destructs like it. [wings flutter] And the face, I can't get the face out of my mind, I can't, I can't get the face out of my mind! God help me please. Yeah, I'm just... I'm just cursed that's all. [somber orchestral music] Oh. - So where'd your friend go? - Don't worry, she'll be back. She's just playing hard to get. Oh. Not my type. But stick around till last call, and you might get lucky. I like the ones with angry eyes. [growls] [laughs] Wooh. - What time is last call? - Depends on the crowd usually, I'd say around midnight or so. - Do me a favor, that brunette that just walked away, make sure she gets a ride home, yeah? - I could suggest it to her, but I don't know... - You make sure she gets home safely. You understand me? - Yes sir. - Good, then get her a fucking cab. - It must be so wonderful to just dance, and see the world, and just be free. - I was actually just thinking the same with you. It must be amazing to be able to play. You're the pianist, right? - I... I haven't played since it happened. - Oh. Is it okay if I... - Yeah, yeah. - Could we talk about it? - Yeah, of course. - What exactly do you wish to accomplish by going back to this place, where all these horrible things happened? - You know, I remember going to bed the night before, but I don't even remember waking up that day. - Have you spoken to your friends about it? Maybe, they'd... You know. - Jayden and I, we didn't really have very many friends. We had our practice time. Our dad, he had a lot of restrictions on us. We weren't really raised like other kids. - Jessica, I know that everything must be really hard for you right now, but have you gone through any of Jayden's stuff? There must be something in there that would help you remember. Something. I don't know. [eerie orchestral music] [light switch clicks] - Here's Jayden's stuff. [dramatic orchestral music] [phone rings] - What is it now, Rita? - Kurt called. He said you're about to do something stupid. - He killed my son. - And how is killing him gonna help our son? - Well, it'll help me. - You already let this destroy our marriage, and now, Billy, it's destroying you. - Yeah, you know what, you wanna start dating again, you wanna play house with that fucking prick, go ahead! But I'm still there, in that moment. And I am trapped, I can't get beyond this. - It was an accident, Billy. - There are no accidents when it comes to my son. Now this bastard's gonna pay. Rita, I'm doing this for all of us. - I'm pregnant. - Congratulations. - I think there's something in here. - Let me see that. - You asked me about the second and ninth circle right? - Yeah, why? - Listen to this. "But to that second circle of sad hell, "where amidst the gust, the whirlwind, "and the flaw, rain, and hailstones, "lovers need not tell their sorrows." There are nine circles in this book, that outline different gates to hell. And where these gates lead, depending on the sin. - Yeah, I... We studied that when we were little. - Well yeah, it looks like your sister took this pretty seriously. I mean she writes about, I suppose it's your mother. And your name is all over these pages. - Let me see that. - Even Lindsey's, next to the section titled third circle, gluttony. Look, sure Lindsey like to drink but she shouldn't be in hell for it. - Do you hear that? - What? - Where is that coming from? [ominous orchestral music] [gasps] I need you to come here, and tell me you see this too. Annalyse... Annalyse? [ominous orchestral music] Annalyse? You okay? [Jessica screams] [dramatic orchestral music] [gasps] [screams] [breathes heavily] Where are you? - [Ogden] Who's there? [screams] I know you. I know it's you! Listen. You're not real. [Jessica screams] [dramatic orchestral music] - Look in the mirror. You're real. - Oh, God. I didn't wanna hurt him. - You didn't wanna hurt anybody. - No. - [Jessica] Maybe you should give me the knife. Everything will be okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. [Jessica screams] - [Evil Voice] Your spirit is attacked by cowardly fear. That often weighs men down. So that it deflects the from honorable action. - Are you God? - [Evil Voice] Before me, nothing was created. And eternal, I endure. Could you possibly understand? I can see every shade, walk with thee. To embrace another shade. Content thee, did not... - You killed Jayden! [Evil Voice laughs] - [Evil Voice] Like a creature seeing phantoms in the dusk. Now let us descend to greater misery. Do you wanna see what happened that night? Jessica? - Help, what happened? [Evil Voice laughs] - [Evil Voice] I'll show you. Jessica. [Jessica screams] - And I thought I would stop by and say thank you, for being such a good father to me, since my dad passed. - You know, I hope you know that, I'm here for you. You can come to me with any of your concerns. I mean, anything. You know, Jessica, she gets all the attention, but I noticed you too. You've turned into quite a beautiful woman. - Thank you, Uncle Alex. May I please go use your restroom? - Yeah, sure. It's all yours, kiddo. [ominous orchestral music] - Says here, we got a hair sample, male. A blood sample, DNA, why didn't they even look at the uncle? That Richie? - Have you told Jayden yet? - Not yet. It might be kind of hard on her right now. They said no to her. She hasn't really found a place that's gonna work yet. - Well you have more talent than she does. That's something she's going to accept. God knows her father pressed that. - I'll tell her tonight. While you're at the opera, with Uncle Alex. - Good girl. I'm so proud of you. Just so proud. [eerie ambient music] [distorted voices] - Wakey, wakey. - What the fuck? Jayden take this off me. - Open wide. [ominous orchestral music] [coughs] That was dad's favorite. I bet you didn't know that though, did you? - What? Is this about the... - Fuck this, this is about everything. This is about mom, and dad. Everything. Why did dad always have to spend more time with you? - He didn't. He always had us both. - He picked you, little perfect you, for the keys. So you could play him all those pieces that he loved. You know I can play too. I can play, and I could've been better than you. - I know you could. I know you can. - Why did mom always... She just would... She'd touch, and she'd squeeze you. - I don't know. - She treated me like I had some kind of plague. Maybe I am a plague. - But I love you. I don't know why any of... We're sisters. I don't... - You just don't wanna die. That's what makes this so tragic. - You're right. - Well. I guess it's like killing myself. That's okay though. Because I'm killing the bad part of us. I'm killing Jayden. - Please. Please don't do anything you can't take back. - Shut up! All I ever wanted was to know what it's like to be you. Just to be loved. To be successful, just once to be the best! - [Jessica] Jayden. - Stupid girl! I am not Jayden. That's you. [Jessica screams] [eerie ambient music] - [Evil Voice] Oh muses. Oh high invention. Aid me now. Oh memory that has engraved what I saw. - [Jayden] Stop! - Here your nobility will be shown. Now let us descend to greater misery. Already every star is declining. That was rising when I set out. [laughs] - You know, I kind of owe you something for giving me a ride home. What do you think of that, pussycat? [laughs] - Woah there, goodnight. - What? You don't like a strong woman? - I just... I really don't like lushes, alright? - Asshole. [laughs] Anyone can just walk in here. [laughs] Jessie! Answer! I think we should take three shots, 'cause I'm not drunk. And you need to make up to my fucking ass. So we're taking shots. [Lindsey shouting in the distance] Jess, you can't be mad fucking forever, it's ridiculous. [phone vibrates] - Hello? - Did I wake you? - No honey, I always wait up like a sick schoolgirl, hoping you will call at one am. - Yeah, well I can't find Jessica. - What? - Well, I just got here, and we were out, and someone else gave her a ride home. - Wait a second, you left your sick cousin with some stranger, and you didn't even check if she got home? - It wasn't a stranger to me. You know, you make me sound so irresponsible. - You are your mother's daughter, that's for sure. - I just found Jayden's journal on her bed. And this really worn copy of Dante's Inferno with this weird ass writing all over it. - Lindsey? - Dad, my name is written all over this journal. - Get out of the house. Just go to a neighbor's, right now. Honey, listen to me. I'm on my way, okay, you stay on the phone with me. - Dad, something's not right. - Get out of the house now, baby. Lindsey! Lindsey, baby! Lindsey! - God! [screams] Dad, there's something wrong! - Kurt, I don't even know where I am. What? Where? [suspenseful orchestral music] - Annalyse? Annalyse? Oh my god. - Fuck. [dramatic orchestral music] [muffled screams] - [Alex] Lindsey! [muffled screams] Lindsey. Oh, I'm sorry baby. Alright. Calm, settle. I know. [sobs] - [Lindsey] Get me out, daddy! - Where is she? [Lindsey screams] [knife slashes] [Lindsey screams] - [Lindsey] Oh god. No! [screams] [shushes] Please, Jessica! Please! - You don't recognize me? I'm not Jessica. - No. [sobs] Please, no. - Oh, oh, poor Lindsey. [laughs] - [Lindsey] Oh, please no. [shushes] [sobs] - Stop. Be careful what you pray for, Linz. [Lindsey chokes] [blood squelches] [Jayden laughs] [eerie orchestral music] [Ogden breathes heavily] [discordant violin notes] [muffled screams] [muffled screams] - Jessica Brown? Put down that knife. - Why would I do that? [violin strings screech] - Because I am a police officer, and I am telling you to do so. [muffled screams] - Are you number seven? You are. Am I number seven? No, you're number seven. - There are no numbers Jessica, only people. - Oh. [laughs] No, there's numbers. Tell you what. I'm gonna count to three, lets see if you can shoot me before I drag this blade across his throat. He's just gonna bleed all over the place, you know that, don't you? - Don't do it. - You ready? One. - Damn it. - Two. [gunshot fires] [dramatic orchestral music] - I know you. I know you, oh God. Protect me, protect me. - Protect you? Who protected my son? - It was an accident. I didn't see him. I didn't see him, it was late. Why was he out in the yard so late that night? Why? - He just wanted to see the fireworks. In his own front yard! God. [somber orchestral music] [sobs] Watts, homicide. I'm at 533 Mays Road. Yeah, multiple homicides. [sobs] No, I don't need an ambulance. There are no survivors. Any last words? - Austin! [sobs] - If I ever see you again... [screams] If you ever speak his name again... I will kill you. [sobs] - No, please. - You want a shot at redemption? - [Ogden] Yeah. No. No! No. - You do it yourself. [breathes heavily] [somber orchestral music] - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, Austin, I'm so sorry. You don't want daddy to be like that man. You don't want daddy to be like that man. I'd just be as guilty. Tell me what to do. Please. Tell me what to do. [somber orchestral music] [eerie orchestral music] [gunshot fires] [gunshot fires] [eerie orchestral music] - I guess I was wrong. I guess neither of us is number seven. I still need to find my number seven. [eerie orchestral music] [police sirens wail] [knock on door] - [Kurt] Watts, if you're in there, open up! Jessica Brown, this is the police, open up. - Please! Somebody help me. [glass shatters] [eerie orchestral music] [dramatic orchestral music]
