(BELLA CLICKS TONGUE) I thought we agreed, no presents. Well, the one from me's not wrapped, so it doesn't count. That's actually great. Thanks, Dad. It goes with this one from your mom. We coordinated. Well, she coordinated me. It's to put your pictures in from senior year. (SIGHS) Senior year. How'd you get so old so fast? I didn't. It's not that old. I don't know. Is that a gray hair? No. No way. (SIGHS) Happy birthday. That's really funny. ANNOUNCER ON RADIO: Another missing hiker brings the total to three presumed dead.

You'll Photoshop this if my nose looks big, right? ERIC: Don't worry, I'm in the picture. No one will be looking at you guys. BELLA: That's good. Oh, good. Cullen's here. (ERIC CHEERS WEAKLY) Well, talk to you later. Happy birthday. Don't remind me. EDWARD: Mmm. Bella, your birth is definitely something to celebrate. Yeah, but my aging's not. Your aging? (CHUCKLES) I think 18 is a little young to start worrying about that. Its one year older than you. No, it isn't. I'm 109. Well, maybe I shouldn't be dating such an old man. Mmm. It's gross. I should be thoroughly repulsed. Uh-huh. (BOTH SIGHING) We have to go to class. Okay. (EDWARD MOANS SOFTLY) Wait a second. Someone wants you. JACOB: Bella! Jacob! What? I'll leave you to talk. Hello, biceps! You know, anabolic steroids are really bad for you. (JACOB LAUGHS) Well, I'm just filling out, Bella. You know, it wouldn't seem so drastic if we hung out more. You should switch schools. You can come hang out with the palefaces. I'm all right. I prefer the rez school's exclusivity. They let any old riffraff into this place. I see. Then why are you slumming it? Mmm-hmm. I was just buying a part for the Rabbit. You should really come take a ride when it's done. Is it fast? Um. It's decent. (BOTH LAUGH) I'm kidding. Okay. Good. Hey, happy birthday. Your dad told my dad, so... Yeah, of course he did. I saw this the other day and thought of you. Catches bad dreams. That's kind of perfect. Thank you. No problem. Good seeing you. Yeah, I'll see you later. Bye. So how come Jacob Black gets to give you a gift and I don't? Because I have nothing to give back to you. Bella, you give me everything just by breathing. (EXHALES) See? Thank you. That's all I want. ALICE: Bella! Happy birthday! Shh, shh! (SCHOOL BELL RINGS) I thought I said no presents. I've already seen you open it, and guess what, you love it. You're gonna wear it tonight. Our place. Come on. Please? It'll be fun. Okay. All right. Great! Okay, I'll see you at 7:00. Jasper, no fair with the mood control thing. (ALICE LAUGHS) Sorry, Bella. Happy... Never mind. You can't trust vampires. Trust me. ROMEO: (ON VIDEO) O my love! My wife! Death, that hath sucked the honey of thy breath hath had no power yet upon thy beauty. Thou art not conquered. Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks. And death's pale flag is not advanced there. BELLA: I hate being celebrated. EDWARD: There are worse tragedies. I mean, look at Romeo. Killed his true love out of sheer stupidity. BELLA: Yeah. Though I do envy him one thing. BELLA: Juliet is, like, perfect. If you like that obviously beautiful sort of thing. (EDWARD LAUGHS) Not the girl, the suicide. It's nearly impossible for... For some people. For humans, a little poison, a dagger to the heart. There's so many different options. Why would you say that? Because I had to consider it once. (BELLA SCREAMING) I didn't know if I'd get to you in time. I had to come up with some kind of plan. What was the plan? That I'd go to Italy and provoke the Volturi. The what? The Volturi. MR. BERTY: Now, who'd like to repeat the last few lines of iambic pentameter just to show they were paying attention? Mr. Cullen? (INHALES DEEPLY) Yes, Mr. Berty. "O here will I set up my everlasting rest" "and shake the yoke of inauspicious stars from this world-wearied flesh." "Eyes, look your last." "Arms, take your last embrace!" "And, lips, O you, the doors of breath," "seal with a righteous kiss a dateless bargain to engrossing death!" Eyes on the screen, people. ROMEO: Thus with a kiss I die. The Volturi are a very old, very powerful family. I guess they're the closest thing to royalty my world has. Is that Carlisle? Yeah. He lived with them for a few decades. Described them as very refined. No respect for human life, of course, but a respect for the arts and the sciences, at least. And the law. Above all, the law. BELLA: Vampires have laws? EDWARD: Not very many. And only one that's regularly enforced. BELLA: What is it? EDWARD: That we keep the existence of our kind a secret. We don't make spectacles of ourselves, and we don't kill conspicuously. Unless, of course, you want to die. (SCREAMS) You gotta stop talking about that. I can't even think about someone hurting you. Bella, the only thing that can hurt me is you. And I don't have anything else to be afraid of. That's not true. Victoria? She'll come for me one day. Alice will see when she decides, and we'll be ready. I could protect you if you change me. Bella, you already do protect me. You're my only reason to stay alive, if that's what I am. But it's my job to protect you. (BELLA SIGHS) From everyone except my sister. It's time! It's time. It's time. It's time!

(CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY) BELLA: I never wanted to have a party. DR. CULLEN: It's not your fault. Jasper hasn't been away from human blood as long as the rest of us. How do you do it? Years and years of practice. Did you ever think of just doing it the easy way? No. I knew who I wanted to be. I wanted to help people. It brings me happiness, even if I am damned regardless. Damned? Like hell? Carlisle, you couldn't be damned. You couldn't. It's impossible. Thank you, Bella. You've always been very gracious about us. So that's it? That's why he won't change me? Imagine the situation in reverse. Hmm. If you believed as Edward does, could you take away his soul? You can't protect me from everything. At some point, something's gonna separate us. It's gonna be an accident or illness or old age, as long as I'm human. And the only solution is to change me. That's not a solution. That's a tragedy. You're not gonna want me when I look like a grandmother. Bella, do you not understand my feelings for you at all? Carlisle told me how you feel about your soul. I don't believe that. So don't worry about mine. You should go inside. It's still my birthday. So can I ask one thing? Kiss me? (BELLA GASPS) (BOTH GASPING) I love you.

'Cause if it's supposed to, like, draw a parallel about leprosy, my cousin had leprosy. It's not funny, you know? And, like, is it supposed to be a metaphor for consumerism? Because don't be so pleased with your own, like, self-referential cleverness, you know? Like, some girls like to shop. Not all girls, apparently. Although I was surprised you even called at all. You know? Like, your depression thing, I get it. I'm totally, totally worried. But after a while it's like, you're still bumming... CHET: You want a ride, girls? And I'm going through stuff, too.

Wow. Scrap metal. You shouldn't have. I saved it from the junkyard. (BELLA CLEARS THROAT) I think they'll probably cost more to fix than they're worth, but then I thought that if I had a mechanic friend to help me out then... Ah! Me being the mechanic-type friend? That's right. Since when are you into motorcycles? Since now. I get it if you think that this is really stupid and reckless. Yeah, I mean, it's completely stupid and reckless. When do we start? Um. Now. Please? (CHUCKLES) All right. Oh, hey, be careful. Those things are actually really heavy, so... Jake, you're, like, buff. How did that happen? You're, like, 16. I don't get it. Mmm-hmm. Age is just a number, baby. What are you, like, 40 now? It feels like that sometimes. (ROMANTIC SONG PLAYING ON STEREO) (TURNS OFF STEREO) That song's good. You don't like it? I don't really like music anymore, kind of. Okay. No more music. So I was thinking, if we're gonna do this every day, and hopefully we will, we have to, like, fit some homework in there somewhere. I don't want Billy thinking that I'm a bad influence on you. You? Influence me? Please. Are you... I'm older than you, so that makes me the influencer and you the influence. (LAUGHS) No, no, no. My size and knowledge base actually makes me older than you because of your general paleness and lack of know-how. I convinced you to build two-wheeled death machines with me. Don't you think that makes you kind of young and naïve? Okay. So where do we stand? I'm 35. And you might be, like, 32. Come on. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) QUIL: Yo, Jake, you in there? It's okay.

What about the part where you're his girlfriend? Uh... We're friends, you know. (LAUGHS) Burn. Actually, remember I said she's a girl and a friend. Embry, do you remember him making that distinction? Nope. So you guys have girlfriends? That's awesome. (JACOB LAUGHING) Yeah, right. Quil's actually taking his cousin to prom. Yeah, that's still a riot. You want funny, Black? I'll give you funny.

Cool. Let me see, we could check out Love Spelled Backwards Is Love. You know, it's a dumb title, but it's a romantic comedy. I mean, it's supposed to be pretty... No. No romance.

So... Okay, well, tell me something. You like me, right? And you think I'm sort of beautiful? (SOFTLY) Jacob, please, don't do this. (BELLA SIGHS) Why? Because you're about to ruin everything. And I need you. (SIGHS) Well, I've got loads of time. I'm not gonna give up. I don't want you to, but it's just 'cause I don't want you to go anywhere. And that's really selfish. You know, I'm not like a car that you can fix up. I'm never gonna run right. So I should be fair to you. It's because of him, right? (JACOB SIGHS DEEPLY) Look, I know what he did to you. But, Bella, I would never ever do that. I won't ever hurt you. I promise. I won't let you down. You can count on me. MIKE: Well, (SNIFFLES) (SIGHS) I need to go home. I was feeling sick before the movie. Okay? (JACOB SCOFFS) What is your problem? Right now? You're my problem. Feeling sick? Maybe you need to go to the hospital.

Look, I don't have to go fishing today. Yes, you do. Yeah, you do. Go. What are you talking about? Just be careful. Always am. Those bears won't get the drop on me, Bella. My kung fu is strong. Jake!

What happened? Did Sam get to you? Is that what's happening? Sam's trying to help me. Don't blame him. But if you want somebody to blame, how about those filthy bloodsuckers you love, the Cullens? (THUNDER RUMBLING) I don't know what you're talking about. No, you know exactly what I'm talking about. You've been lying to everyone. Charlie. But you can't lie to me. Not anymore, Bella. SAM: Jacob! Jacob! Look, Bella, we can't be friends anymore. (CRYING) Look, Jake, I know that I've been hurting you. It's killing me. It kills me. I just need... Maybe give me, like, some time or something. Look, don't. It's not you. It's not you, it's me, right? Really? It's true. It is me. I'm not good. I used to be a good kid. Not anymore. This doesn't even matter. All right? This is over. You can't break up with me. I mean... I mean, you're my best friend. You promised me. I know. I promised I wouldn't hurt you, Bella. And this is me keeping that promise. Go home and don't come back or you're gonna get hurt. BELLA: Alice, things are... Things are bad again. Without Jake, I just... I can't stand it. I don't see Edward anymore. Will it really feel like he never existed? I will find the place where I can see him again. (SOBBING) Bella. Laurent. I didn't expect to find you here. I went to visit the Cullens, but the house is empty. I'm surprised they left you behind. Weren't you sort of a pet of theirs? Yeah. You could say that. Do the Cullens visit often? Lie. (GASPS) Yeah, absolutely, all the time. Lie better. I'll tell them that you stopped by. But I probably shouldn't tell Edward, 'cause he's pretty protective. But he's far away, isn't he? Why are you here? I came as a favor to Victoria. Victoria? She asked me to see if you were still under the protection of the Cullens. Victoria feels it's only fair to kill Edward's mate, given he killed hers. An eye for an eye. Threaten him. Edward would know who did it. And he'd come after you. I don't think he will. After all, how much could you mean to him if he left you here unprotected? (LAURENT SIGHS) Victoria won't be happy about my killing you, but I can't help myself. You are so mouth-watering. Please, don't. I mean, you helped us. No, no, no, no. (SHUSHING) Don't be afraid. I'm doing you a kindness. (SOFTLY) Victoria plans on killing you slowly, painfully, whereas I'll make it quick. I promise. You will feel nothing. Edward, I love you. (TWIGS SNAPPING) I don't believe it. (LOW GROWLING) (ROARS) (GASPS) (WEREWOLVES RUNNING) (YELPING) (GASPS) Dad! I saw them. What's the matter?

Get some of your guys together? Sure, yeah, I'll just... BELLA: By now, those wolves will be dead, and Laurent would have told her I'm unprotected. Victoria. I should go to the station. Yeah, you should. You should go. CHARLIE: Can you just stay in the house? (THUNDER RUMBLING) (CLATTERING) (CLATTERING CONTINUES) JACOB: (WHISPERS) Bella! You scared me. What the hell are you doing? Back up. I'm coming up. (GASPS) Hey. Look, I'm sorry. For what? I wish I could explain. But I literally can't. (SIGHS) Have you ever had a secret you couldn't tell anyone, one that wasn't yours to share? Well, that's what it's like for me. But worse. You have no idea how tight I'm bound. I hate this. I hate what they've done to you. I mean, the killer part is, you already know. Bella, do you remember when we walked on the beach at La Push? The... The story. The story about the cold ones. I guess I understand why that's the only part you remember. There's gotta be something that you can do. No. I'm in it for life. Well, maybe we should just get out of here for a while. Just leave, just you and me. You'd do that? I would do it for you. It's not something I can just run away from, Bella. But I would run away with you if I could. I gotta go. They'll start wondering where I am. Come here. (SOFTLY) Please, try to remember. It'd be so much easier if you knew. I'll try. But, Jake... Jake, what are you doing? Wait, Jake. (GASPS) Jake. (GASPS) Edward, I'm scared. You should be. JACOB: Really, it's just like an old story. I'm not really supposed to say anything about it. Did you know Quileutes are supposedly descended from wolves? (WEREWOLF SNARLS) Bella? I need to see him. He's not in. Okay, I'm sorry, I really need to see him. Bella! What did you do? Okay, what did you do? Hey. What did you do to him? Easy! He didn't want this. What did we do? What did he do? What'd he tell you? Both of you calm down. Nothing. He tells me nothing because he's scared of you. (SNICKERING) Too late now. SAM: Bella, get back! (PAUL GROWLING SOFTLY) SAM: Paul, calm down, now! Bella! Run! Jake, run! (GROWLING) (WHIMPERS) (BOTH SNARLING) SAM: Paul! Hey! Take Bella back to Emily's place. EMBRY: Guess the wolf's out of the bag. BELLA: Alice, is it possible that everything is true? The fairy tales and horror stories? Is it possible that there isn't anything sane or normal at all? (BOTH WHOOP) Hey, I think we should go back and see if Jacob's okay. I hope Paul sinks some teeth in him. Serves him right. No way. Jacob's a natural. You see him phase on the fly? I got five says Paul doesn't touch him. Come on in, Bella. We won't bite. Speak for yourself. (DONE ALL WRONG PLAYING) ♪ I done me wrong ♪ ♪ And done all wrong ♪ ♪ All the wrong I've done I'm sure I'll live quite long ♪ Oh, hey, about Emily, Sam's fiancée? Don't stare. It bugs Sam. Why would I stare? Are you guys hungry? Like I have to ask. (EMILY LAUGHING) Who's this? JARED: Bella Swan. Who else? Hmm. So, you're the vampire girl. So, you're the wolf girl. Guess so. Well, I'm engaged to one. Save some for your brothers. And ladies first. Muffin? Sure. Thanks. Leave it to Jacob to find a way around Sam's gag order. He didn't say anything to me. That's a wolf thing. Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want them to or not. And check it out. We can hear each other's thoughts. Would you shut up? These are trade secrets. Damn it! This chick runs with vampires. You can't really run with vampires. (EMILY GIGGLES) 'Cause they're fast. Yeah? Well, we're faster. Freaked out yet? You're not the first monsters I've met. SAM: Jake's right. You're good with weird. Hey. (EMILY GIGGLING) Sorry. So you're a werewolf? Yeah. Last time I checked. A few lucky members of the tribe have the gene. A bloodsucker moves into town and the fever sets in. Mono. Yeah. I wish. Well, can't you find a way to just stop? I mean, it's wrong. It's not a lifestyle choice, Bella. I was born this way. I can't help it. You're such a hypocrite. What, I'm not the right kind of monster for you? It's not what you are. It's what you do. They never hurt anybody. You've killed people, Jake. Bella, we're not killing anyone. Then who is? What we're trying to protect you people from, the only thing we do kill, vampires. Wait, Jake, you can't. Don't worry. We can't touch your little precious Cullens unless they violate the treaty. That's not what I'm saying. You can't kill vampires. They'll... They'll kill you. Really? We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough. (WEREWOLVES GROWLING) Laurent? And his red-headed girlfriend is next. Victoria's here? Was. We chased her all the way to the Canadian border the other night. She keeps coming back. We don't know what she's after. I do. Me. Don't worry. We've got this place covered. She won't get near you or Charlie. Look, you've got to be careful. She's fast. You don't know how fast she is. You know, your lack of confidence in us is a little insulting. All right, I'd better go. You gotta go? Yeah. Got a vampire to kill. BELLA: Alice, I'm all right. Until I'm alone. And lately, that's all the time. Jacob's gone. He's hunting Victoria. And Charlie's hunting Jacob. And you're gone. And so is Edward. And there's just nothing now. You got something, Harry? Nope. Nothing. But I realize where I have to go, what I have to do to see him again.

Bella, can you hear me? Jake? Come here. What the hell were you thinking? I just wanted to see something. Get her home! I'm gonna go help out over at Harry's place. What happened at Harry's? Harry Clearwater had a heart attack. Charlie and my dad are over at his place with his family. Is he okay? He's gone. Come on. I'll get you something dry and drive you home. (BELLA SHIVERING) 108 degrees over here. God! My hands are freezing. It must be nice, never getting cold. It's a wolf thing. It's not. It's a Jacob thing. You're just warm. You're like your own sun. This is better, now that you know about me. But... You saw what happened to Emily. Sam got angry. Lost it for a split second. Em was standing too close. He'll never be able to take that back. What if I got mad at you? (JACOB SIGHS) Sometimes, I feel like I'm gonna disappear. Okay, not that you need me to tell you something like this, but I always will. You're not gonna lose yourself. I wouldn't let that happen. How? I'll tell you all the time how special you are. (BELLA INHALES SHARPLY) Thank you. For everything. Wait. There's a vampire. How do you know? I can smell it. I'm getting you out of here. That's Carlisle's car. They're here. Bella, it's a trick! Stop! You gotta come with me! (BELLA GRUNTS) They won't hurt me. If a Cullen is back here, this is their territory. Treaty says we can only defend on our own lands. I can't protect you here. Okay. That's okay. You don't have to. You're about to cross a line. Then don't draw one. Please? (BELLA GASPS) Alice? Oh, my God! What are you... Bella! I'm sorry, I just, I can't believe you're here. Is... Would you like to explain to me how you're alive? What? I saw a vision of you. You jumped off a cliff. Why in the hell would you try and kill yourself? I mean, what about Charlie? What about... I didn't try to kill myself. I was cliff jumping. Recreationally. It was fun. (EXHALES) I have never met anyone more prone to life-threatening idiocy. Does... Did you tell him? No. He only calls in once every few months. He said he wants to be alone. Bella, what is that God-awful wet dog smell? Um... That's probably me. Or it's Jacob. Jacob who? Jacob's kind of a werewolf. Bella! Werewolves are not good company to keep. Speak for yourself. I had to see you were safe. I thought you couldn't protect me here. Guess I don't care. Well, I'm not gonna hurt her. No, you're just a harmless Cullen. I'm talking about the other bloodsucker who tried to kill Bella because of you. Victoria? Yeah, Victoria's been around. I didn't see her. I didn't see you get pulled out of the water, either. I can't see past you and your pack of mutts. Don't get me upset... Hey, stop. Stop, stop, stop, stop. Or things are gonna get very ugly. I'll give you a minute. Hey. You're not going anywhere. You're gonna come back, right? As soon as you put the dog out. Is he... Are there others? How many Cullens are here and how long are they staying? No. It's just Alice. And she can stay as long as she'd like. Well, are the rest coming back? No. Not that I know of. (BELLA SCOFFS) Anything else? That's it. Well, if that's all, then you'd better go run back to Sam. I've done it again. I keep breaking my promise. We don't have to do this to each other. Yes, we do. (SOFTLY) Bella... (SPEAKS QUILEUTE) (PHONE RINGING) Swan residence. (SIGHS) He's not here right now. He's arranging a funeral. (CELL PHONE CRACKING) Who was that? What? Always in the way. Who was that? Bella, step back. Jake, who was that? Bella! Bella, it's Edward. He thinks you're dead. Rosalie told him why I came here. Why would you... Why didn't you let me speak to him? He didn't ask for you. Bella. I don't care! Bella. Bella! He's going to the Volturi. He wants to die, too. JACOB: He left you, Bella. He didn't want you anymore. Remember? No, I'm not gonna let him kill himself out of guilt. What about your dad? I'm 18. I'm legally free to go, and I left a note. Please, Bella, just stay here. For Charlie. Or for me. I have to go. I'm begging you. Please. Goodbye, Jacob. Okay. (AIRPLANE WHOOSHING) (CAR ACCELERATING) So you've made up your minds. I'm afraid your particular gifts are too valuable to destroy. But if you're unhappy with your lot, join us. We would be delighted to utilize your skills. Won't you consider staying with us? You know it will happen anyway. Not without cause. Such a waste. I'm guessing you didn't rent this car? I figured you wouldn't be opposed to grand theft auto. Not today. What? What do you see? They refused him. So? He's gonna make a scene. Show himself to the humans. No! When? ALICE: He's gonna wait until noon, when the sun's at its highest. (GRUNTS) God, Alice, you got to hurry up. There's Volterra. (HORN HONKING) (TIRES SQUEALING) (HONKING CONTINUES) (PEOPLE CHATTERING) Why are they all in red? San Marco's Day festival. They're commemorating the expulsion of vampires from the city. It's the perfect setting. The Volturi will never let him get far enough to reveal himself. (PANTING) We have five minutes. I know, Bella, just breathe. (HORN HONKING) Alice! Bella, you're the only one he can't see coming. If I go, he'll read my thoughts. He'll think I'm lying. He'll rush into it. Where do I go? He'll be under the clock tower. Go! (CROWD CHANTING) (BELL TOLLS) Don't! (BELLA PANTING) Heaven. You have to move. Open your eyes. Look at me. I'm alive. You have to move. Bella. You're here. I'm here. You're alive. Yes. I needed to make you see me once. You had to know that I was alive, that you didn't have to feel guilty about anything. I can let you go now. I never acted out of guilt. I just couldn't live in a world where you don't exist. But you said... I lied. I had to lie. But you believed me so easily. Because it doesn't make sense for you to love me. I mean, I'm nothing. I'm human. I'm nothing. Bella, you're everything to me. You're everything. (GATE OPENS) I won't be needing your services after all, gentlemen. Aro wants to speak with you again. No rules were broken. Nonetheless, we should take this conversation to a more appropriate venue. Fine. Bella, why don't you go and enjoy the rest of the festival? The girl comes with us. No. You can go to hell. (LOCK BREAKS) Come on, guys. It's a festival. You wouldn't want to make a scene. We wouldn't. Enough. Jane. Aro sent me to see what was taking so long. Just do as she says. Go ahead. Don't be scared. Are you? No. (JANE SCOFFS) (OPERA PLAYING) (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Is she human? Yes. Does she know? Yes. Then, why would... She wants to be. And so she will be. Or dessert. ALEC: Sister. They send you out to get one and you bring back two. And a half. Such a clever girl. What a happy surprise! Bella is alive after all. Isn't that wonderful? I love a happy ending. ARO: Ah. (GASPS) They are so rare. (GASPS) (SPEAKING ITALIAN) Her blood appeals to you so much it makes me thirsty. How can you stand to be so close to her? It's not without difficulty. Yes, I can see that. (ARO CHUCKLING) Aro can read every thought I've ever had with one touch. And now you know everything. So get on with it. You are quite a soul reader yourself, Edward. Though you can't read Bella's thoughts. Fascinating. I would love to see if you are an exception to my gifts, as well. Would you do me the honor? Interesting. Hmm. I see nothing. I wonder if... Let us see if she's immune to all our powers. Shall we, Jane? No! Pain. (GROANS) BELLA: Stop! Stop! Please! Stop! (GRUNTS) Stop! Just stop hurting him! Please! Please! Jane? Master? (GASPS) Go ahead, my dear. This may hurt just a little. (LAUGHING EXCITEDLY) Remarkable! She confounds us all. So what do we do with you now? You already know what you're going to do, Aro. She knows too much. She's a liability. Hmm. That's true. Felix? EDWARD: No! (GASPS) Please! No! No! Please, please! Kill me! Kill me! Not him. How extraordinary. You would give up your life for someone like us. A vampire. A soulless monster. Just get away from her! You don't know a thing about his soul. (SPEAKING ITALIAN) This is a sadness. If only it were your intention to give her immortality. Wait! Bella will be one of us. I've seen it. I'll change her myself. Mesmerizing. To see what you have seen before it has happened. Your gifts will make for an intriguing immortal, Isabella. Go now. Make your preparations. Let us be done with this. Heidi will arrive any moment. Thank you for your visit. CAIUS: We will return the favor. I would advise that you follow through on your promise soon. We do not offer second chances. ARO: Goodbye, my young friends. (PEOPLE CHATTERING) DEMETRI: Nice fishing, Heidi. Yes, they do look rather juicy. Save some for me. HEIDI: This way, please. Stay together. (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (GASPING) (SCREAMS ECHOING) Stop! Stop! You're here. You can sleep. I'll still be here when you wake up. Bella, the only reason I left was because I thought I was protecting you. I needed you to have a chance at a normal, happy life. It was so easy for you to leave. Leaving you was the hardest thing I've done in 100 years. (SIGHING) And I swear, I will never fail you again. I'm so sorry. Charlie's coming. Hey. You okay? I'm fine. Dad, you don't have to worry. You know, last time you said that, you took off. I didn't see you for three days. I'm really sorry, Dad. Bella, do not ever do that to me again. Ever. And you're grounded for the rest of your life. Okay. I'm not technically breaking any of his rules. He did say I couldn't take a step inside the door. I came in through the window. He's not gonna forgive me easily. I know. Can you? I hope you can, 'cause I honestly don't know how to live without you. Come here. Once Alice changes me, you can't get rid of me. She won't need to change you. There are always ways to keep the Volturi in the dark. No. No. You all know what I want. And I know how much I'm asking for. The only thing that I can think of for it to be fair is to just vote. You don't know what you're talking about. Shut up. Alice? I already consider you my sister. Yes. Thank you. JASPER: I vote "yes." It would be nice to not want to kill you all the time. Hmm. ROSALIE: I'm sorry. I'm really sorry to both of you for how I've acted, and I'm really grateful that you were brave enough to go and save my brother. But this isn't a life I would have chosen for myself. And I wish that there'd been someone to vote "no" for me. So, no. I vote "Hell, yeah." And we can pick a fight with these Volturi some other way. I already consider you a part of the family. Yes. (DR. CULLEN SIGHS) Why are you doing this to me? You know what this means. You've chosen not to live without her, which leaves me no choice. I won't lose my son. BELLA: I'll wait until after graduation to make it easier on Charlie. Edward, I want you to be the one to do it. (TIRES SCREECH) He wants to talk to me. JACOB: So you're still alive for now. EDWARD: He thinks it's me keeping you away. JACOB: You stay the hell out of my head. Jacob, I know you have something to say to me. But I want to say something to you first, if that's all right. Thank you. Thank you for keeping Bella alive when I didn't. No. You didn't. And it wasn't for your benefit, trust me. I'm still grateful. But I'm here now. I'm not gonna leave her side until she orders me away. We'll see. Hey, my turn to talk. I'm here to remind you about a key point in the treaty. I haven't forgotten. What key point? If any of them bites a human, the truce is over. But if I choose it, it has nothing to do with you. No. No, I won't let you. You're not gonna be one of them, Bella. It's not up to you. You know what we'll do to you. I won't have a choice. Bella, please, come. Wait. Is he gonna hurt me? Read his mind. Jake, I love you. (JACOB BREATHES DEEPLY) So, please, don't make me choose, 'cause it'll be him. It's always been him. Bella... Goodbye, Jacob. No, you don't speak for her! (GROWLING) (ROARS) Bella, get out of here. BELLA: Stop! Stop! You can't hurt each other without hurting me. Jake. He's right. You shouldn't become what I am. I can't do this alone. Then, please, just wait. Just give me five years. That's too long. (SIGHS) Then three? You're so stubborn. What are you waiting for? I have one condition if you want me to do it myself. What's the condition? And then forever. That's what I'm asking. Marry me, Bella.
