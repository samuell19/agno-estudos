[SILENCE] [THEME MUSIC] [THEME MUSIC] [MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRDS CHIRPING] [KEYS JANGLING] [KEYS JANGLING] Can you hear what's happening in my mind? No, why do you ask? You're shaking your keys in the same pattern that I'm singing to myself. Really? How do you mean? Ba, ba black sheep, have you any wool? That's funny. Well we just thought of the same thing at the same time. Nobody can read anybody's mind. Maybe fathers can read their sons minds. - Nope. - Can mommy-- Read their daughters minds? No. You just did. Really and truly I just guessed. [BIRDS CHIRPING] I'm thirsty. We'll be home soon. I'm thirsty now. Listen to that bird. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Hey. I fell because I was thirsty. Richie, how old are you? Six. Well, act your age. [BIRDS CHIRPING] What kind of a bird is that? A marvelous bird. But what's its name? Richie, I could tell you its name if I knew it in all the languages in the world. But then you'd just know what people call it in different places. You wouldn't learn anything about it. You've got to look at the bird. You've got to listen to the bird. You gotta try to understand what it's doing. You gotta notice everything. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Hey, Pop. How come when I pull the wagon, the ball rolls back, and when I stop, the ball rolls forward? Why is that? That nobody knows. But the general principle is that things that are moving like to keep moving, and things that are still like to stay still. There's a name for that. It's called inertia. But nobody knows why it's true. Look at it from the side. See, it's really the back of the wagon you're pulling against the ball and the ball stands still. [WAGON CREAKING] From the friction the ball moves forward a little bit compared to the ground. It doesn't move back. [WAGON CREAKING] That makes sense? Watch again. [MUSIC PLAYING] You understand? Yeah? Let's go. [MUSIC PLAYING] RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: Not having experience with many fathers, I didn't realize how remarkable he was. How did he learn the deep principles of science and the love of it, what's behind it, and why it's worth doing. I never really asked him because I just assumed that those were things that fathers knew. [MUSIC PLAYING] The Taube twins on Mounter Street? They look like it, but I don't think they can. [MUSIC PLAYING] RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: He made uniforms for a living. And he was a vegetarian. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [PIANO PLAYING] - What's going on? - Hey Hey. That's Arline. Arline is here. Yeah. Hey Richie, fish face. Arline is here. Who is this queen Arline? You don't know Arline? From Cedarhurst. ARLINE: [SINGING] So you so ugly, you so ugly, you's some ugly child. The clothes that you wear are not in style. You look like in ape every time you smile, babe. Oh how I hate you. You alligator bait, you. The homeliest thing I ever saw or seen. You're knocked kneed, pigeon toed, box ankled too. There's a curse on your family and it fell on you. Your teeth are yella. Who's your fella? You's some ugly child. [PIANO PLAYING] It's a good song. [MUSIC PLAYING] RICHARD: Two times two plus four times five divided by six plus seven times eight plus nine times 10 plus 11, , 12, [MUTTERING],, 14, 15 16 17 18 plus 19 20 plus-- [MUSIC PLAYING] RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: She took art at the Temple Youth Center. So I became a student [MUSIC PLAYING] I didn't know you liked art. Oh well I do very much. You do? Oh sure. What were you doing jumping in circles last Wednesday? Wednesday? Yeah outside your house on the stoop you were-- Oh --jumping. Oh yeah. Well I was, I was trying to figure out you see. If I count hippopotamuses one hippopotamus, two hippopotamus, three hippopotamus and I get to 60, it always takes me the same amount of time. They're seconds. I don't know what they are, but they're the same every time. They're not actually seconds, when I time them, but they're the same every time, which is the point. So I thought, well what is it? Is it my heartbeat? Am I unconsciously listening to my pulse or what? So I tried counting and jumping around in circles which would make my heart beat faster. And it was different, huh? No, it was the same. See ya. I gotta get back to my horse. I'm making a horse. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOORBELL RINGING] RADIO VOICE: Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome again to Take Or Leave It in all American California where everything is going fine. It's Richie Feynman MRS. GREENBAUM: Hello, Richie. RADIO: That's right. I told you. Hello Mr. And Mrs. Greenbaum. MAN'S VOICE: Hello there Richie. Who's that? That's my Uncle Peter. He's a real donkey. RICHARD: Am I supposed to say hello? No. He isn't even a real uncle. That's lucky. He might be part donkey. I thought maybe you could help me with my homework. Well I'll certainly try. Did you do that? Yeah last year. It's good. Is it the circus? Yeah. [CLEARING THROAT] This is a Mobius strip. One surface, one side. Here, try it. Make a line on it. [MUSIC PLAYING] [PENCIL DRAWING] This is wonderful. This is a Mobius strip? Yeah. ARLINE: I'm gonna show them that at school. [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: In 1939, I was in my senior year at MIT. That was the year the war started in Europe. For me, it was my senior year. I took Arline away for a weekend at Atlantic City. What're you doing that for? I want you to look nice. I want to make a nice appearance so people think well of us. What do you care what other people think? [MUSIC PLAYING] ARLINE: Are following me? Are you following me? [MUSIC PLAYING] Ah, look at that. Look at that. [SPEAKING CHINESE] [ABACUS SOUNDS] [SPEAKING CHINESE] [ABACUS SOUNDS] Oh, I think I should have a back scratcher. It has always been my position that everyone should have a back scratcher. [ABACUS SOUNDS] [SPEAKING CHINESE] I bet I could beat you. Huh? Oh. [ABACUS SOUNDS] Listen, I challenge you. Huh? Challenge? Well, yeah. Yeah, I'd like to. I bet I can calculate with my head faster than you can with that abacus. Suppose you write down two lists of identical numbers, and then hand them to us at the same time. OK RICHARD: Wait, wait let me get a pen. [SPEAKING CHINESE] ARLINE: That's your dog? Oh-- [DOG BARK] --no. Begin. [ABACUS SOUNDS] 4,016,732. [SPEAKING CHINESE] Multiplication. Is that your dad? Maybe. Ready RICHARD: Yeah. Go. [ABACUS SOUNDS] TOGETHER: 500,046. Cube root. Eh, It's e-- 12. RICHARD: No no no more digits. More digits. What, what decimal point? Mmm. Decimal places? Decimal places. 12.0. 12.0. 12.002384? Uh, we do again. We do again. ARLINE: Oh no. No thank you. Thank you. I don't think that we can. But thank you very much. No, no. No pay. I want to introduce you to my friend Lee Hua. Hello. And this is Man, Xingsan Man. And Yao. And of course, my son Weitea. RICHARD: Happy to meet you. ARLINE: Happy to meet you. Thank you. Not at all. OK, see you again. [SPEAKING CHINESE] That was nice. Wasn't it? So how'd you do it? Ah, you don't wanna know how I did it. He doesn't know anything about numbers just beads. You want a hamburger? Yes please. [MUSIC PLAYING] With an abacus, you don't have to know anything about arithmetic. You just buzz those beads around. He doesn't know numbers. I don't know beads, but I know arithmetic. So the harder the problem gets, the better off I am, and the worse off he is. Is this your napkin? No, it's not. How is he supposed to understand approximating? Half a bead? Also I got lucky. The number the guy picked was 1,729.03. Was it? Yeah. I happen to know that a cubic foot contains 1,728 cubic inches. So the answer is just a teeny bit more than 12. Well why does 12 come in? Because there's 12 inches in a foot. OK, well I didn't notice that. So the excess, the difference between the guy's number and the number of inches in a cubic foot is 1.03. And that's only one part in nearly 2,000. And I know that in calculus that for small fractions, the cube root's excess is 1/3 of the number's excess. So all I had to do was find the fraction 1/1728, multiply by 4, divide by 3, and multiply by 12. So I was able to pull out a whole bunch of extra digits that way. Cubic roots. I must be his top notch exercise in abacus land. You look very sweet in that coat. Yeah? I got it with Muffy Hers is blue, and the rickrack is here too. Oh, there? She shouldn't. Tsk tsk. Oh Muffy. Anyway it would look different on Muffy. Muffy's bust is not as full as yours. Well that's where you're wrong. She wears two bras and too slips to disguise it. - You're kidding? - I swear it. Anyway, if you're gonna compare Muffy's bust to mine, it sure as hell not going to help you. All right, I'll do it on my own. Muffy's bust is bigger than my bust. Bet you can't say that three times fast. Muffy's bust is bigger than my bust. Muffy's bust is bigger than bust. Muffy's bust is bigger than my bust. Baltic. [MUSIC PLAYING] Ah-- look at this dress. [MUSIC PLAYING] Isn't it a pretty dress? Oh, look at the skirt. I'd like to buy it for you. [MUSIC PLAYING] It's so awfully nice. Yes, it certainly is. C'mon. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOG BARKING] I suppose if you get a room from your friend's brother's cousin, you have to take what you can get. Hey, is that what this is? Not quite. Almost. God, wasn't that a pretty dress? I'll never forget that dress. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DOG BARKING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [DRAWER CREAKING] [TAPPING NOISE] Richie. [TAPPING NOISE] Richie, wake up. Honey. [TAPPING NOISE] Wake up. [TAPPING NOISE] Ha. [MUSIC PLAYING] ARLINE: Well, why should she like fish? Why not? ARLINE: Well, why should she in particular like kipper? MRS. FEYNMAN: Arline, darling, don't encourage Joan. Why does station announcers have small hands? Wee paws for station identification. MR. FEYNMAN: So, it's time for my painting class. MRS. FEYNMAN: You'll be home by 6:30, OK? MR. FEYNMAN: We'll be back before then. Arline has to be home at 6:00. I gotta pack. Write if you get work. Clutz! MRS. FEYNMAN: Come on. You want this one? It's got a big hole in it. Ah, it doesn't matter. MRS. FEYNMAN: Sure it does. It'll get bigger. - Hey, what's that? - Present. Hey, huh, it's gorgeous. Look at that. I'm gorgeous. It's a rain hat. I think it always rains in college. I'm only going to New Jersey. Honey, you want your moccasins? Sure. You ever gonna live with us again? Yeah, summers. Nah you won't. Nobody else does. They all go to work. RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: So there I was with my scholarship to the graduate program at Princeton. My father moved me in. RICHARD: I thought you were listening. MR. FEYNMAN: I was listening. But it's very complicated. Well, if you didn't understand what the guy said, you should ask him to explain it to you instead of just driving. Yeah, yeah yeah. RICHARD: Well? MR. FEYNMAN: I've been trying to get you to explain ever since we left New York. What are you talking about? Spontaneous generation? RICHARD: Pop, just calm down, will you? Just calm down or I can't talk to you. Feynman, please. Oh yes sir. Top of the stairs to the left. This photon. Where does it come from? I don't know what you're talking about, Pop. Well, the atom makes a transition, and a photon comes out. - Yeah? [CLOCK CHIMING] So was the photon in the atom waiting to come out? No, there's no photon beforehand. It just appears when the atom changes its state? [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Ah. Hmm. [TAPPING ON BED] [MUSIC PLAYING] Mathematics is a language. It's very difficult. It's subtle. You couldn't say those things any other way. And I can talk to dead people with it. I talk to Copernicus every day. What do you keep doing that with your hand for? I got a swelling. Can you look at it? I don't see anything. Oh, see? Feel. It's right there. Oh, yeah. If you weren't such a pretty girl, you wouldn't even have noticed it. Yeah? Well being such a pretty girl, I'm gonna go see my uncle doctor. You call that a smooch? [MUSIC PLAYING] RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: Then, sometime later, the bump began to change. It got bigger or maybe it was smaller? And she got a fever. She was told she had typhoid fever. Right away, I went to the library to look it up. I wanted to help her, and the only way I knew was to look it up in medical books. I'd read there was an absolute test for typhoid. The Widal test. We wore these gowns to guard against her infecting us. Doctor, how'd the Widal test come out? Negative. Negative? How can that be? Excuse me. Maybe she doesn't even have typhoid fever. RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: And, of course, it turned out she didn't have typhoid fever. After a while, Arline got better on her own apparently. The swelling went down, and the fever went away. But after some weeks, the swelling started again. And this time she went to another doctor. You can put your clothes behind the curtain. And gown opens in the front. What should I take off? Everything but your shoes. Everything? But it's in my neck? Well, the doctor wants to examine you. OK. [KNOCK ON DOOR] How are you feeling today? OK. You can lie back. RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: This guy feels under her armpits, and in her groin and so on, and notices there's swelling in those places too. He says the problem is in her lymphatic glands, but he doesn't yet know what the specific disease is. He will consult with other doctors. I took another trip to the library. [MUSIC PLAYING] BASEBALL PLAYER: Hey batter, batter batter. All right, here you go. Yeah, go, OK. Comin' around. Up here. Oh! Ah. Hey, ball? Nice throw, DiMaggio. RICHARD: OK, I got it. You don't have to see it. I'll tell you. The only thing is, you know those jokes about medical students getting every disease that they read about. The only thing is I think that we're in serious trouble, maybe. Maybe. It says, for possibilities, one TB of the lymphatic glands. This is very easy to diagnose, blah blah blah. But this can't be what you have, or they would know it. And then there's all kinds of other diagnoses, and they're all serious from what I can understand. You want to see it? One of them is called Hodgkin's disease. ARLINE: What's that like? That's no good. We wouldn't want that to happen to us. It's fatal. BASEBALL PLAYER: I got it. I got it. I got it. We don't have to take this as final. We don't know enough. I don't know how to read medical books. But it doesn't look good. Richie, is this Hodgkin's disease, is it catching? No. No. No, no, no. Excuse me, Miss Greenbaum? Uh, tell me. Do you spit up blood? Have you ever coughed up blood? No. Uh, do you cough? No. Doctor, will you look at her, please. RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: I didn't know what this guy meant. NURSE: That miserable doctor. RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: They kept having meetings that I wasn't supposed to know about. I suppose they wanted me calm. Listen, I'll be right back. I, I I got to find out something. OK. No, I'm sure he'll be fine. We'll just check the chart one more time find release-- Dr. Hellman. Hello, Richard. Richard, this is Dr. Shank. Richard Feynman. Richard is Arline's fiancé. So any news? What do you think? Well, we think the most likely possibility is Hodgkin's disease. It's a very strange disease, Richard. There will be some periods of improvement. And there will be some periods in the hospital. It's fatal after a few years. Well I'm sorry to hear that. I'll tell her what you said. Richie, sit down. Richie, we haven't even told her parents yet. She's very young. We don't want to upset her. We're going to tell her she has glandular fever. Oh no, no, no, no, no. We've already discussed the possibility of Hodgkin's disease. I know that she wants to know. Richie, calm yourself. I am calm. I haven't told her parents yet. You already said that. Richie, I'm trying to help. I would like to cure her, but the world isn't always what I would like. Isn't it, sir? I'm sorry to hear that. Richie, you gotta cooperate. Why? Richie, stop it. What are you going to do, spoil whatever time she has left? What? Her last two years, you're going to spoil that? You want to pile a lie on top of this terrible news? Why? Ah, you're childish. You think we don't love Arline? She's gonna ask me what she's got. You want me to lie to her? Think of her mother. Richie, stop it. Just stop it. She's the most wonderful, wonderful, wonderful girl. She taught me how to ride my bike. You're the most foolish stubborn, foolish brother. [CRYING] [HOSPITAL SOUNDS] Hi. They're telling me that I have glandular fever. And I'm not sure whether I believe them or not. Richie, do I have glandular fever, or do have Hodgkin's disease? You have glandular fever. Oh, fine. So I can go home. Look, Mom. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CRYING] MRS GREENBAUM: [CRYING] I want her to go to college. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. [MUSIC PLAYING] So I heard my mother crying, and I thought, well why is my mother crying so hard if I have glandular fever? On the other hand, Richie wouldn't lie to me. So I couldn't make it out. And then I thought, although I know it seems impossible because you wouldn't-- do I have glandular fever, or do I have Hodgkin's? You have Hodgkin's disease. God. They must have put you through hell. I thought-- they must have given you such a terrible time. You mustn't do that again, ever. We're not like that. That's not the way we are. We're different. I'll think what to do in a minute. Look, I, I even wrote your letter, because I figured that you would find out one day and give me the heave ho. You want to see it? I could look later. OK, OK I have Hodgkin's disease. So what do we do now? If we get married, I lose my scholarship. If we don't get married, when will I see you? You want to get married? I know you do. So I'm in the middle of trying to get my PhD. My father will kill me. He'll kill me. But I could get a job working at the Bell Telephone Laboratories doing research. Have you heard of them? Mmm-hmm. Well, it's a very nice place to work. And we could get a little apartment in Queens that isn't too far from the hospital or Bell Labs. So we can go back and forth. Well, we'll have to. RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: So we got it all figured out that afternoon. But I think I'm so smart, and I'm not so smart. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello? ARLINE: Richie, I got the report from the biopsey. Yeah? Is it good or bad? It's positive. I have TB. I'm a jerk. I'm a jerk. I'm a monkey. I thought T.B was the obvious case, so I thought-- You remember that that little guy who came running down the hall-- do you spit up blood? Well he knew what it probably was. I'm a dope. So I may live as long as seven years. I may even get better. And that's not good news? Well, now we're going to have to wait to get married. You mean you liked our solution? Yeah. Well it was elegant. But Putzie, this is a much better circumstance. And we'll find something just as elegant. And not so different. Huh, and back to me maybe being catching again. Well. Richie, listen. I might get well. But I might not. And if I don't, I don't want to have lived and died my whole life long in this room. Well I can see that. RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: Soon after that, we had to take her to Deborah hospital. Arline began to play a game with the world. She had a lot of time to think. She would read magazines, and send away for this and that. She was always cooking up something. Arline was in her room. But she was in the world. We were doing two different things, but we tried to keep track of each other. Dick. Morning John. Morning. All right, this isn't right, because it varies inversely as the square of the distance of the other electrons, whereas it shouldn't depend on any of these variables at all. It's also dependent inversely on the mass of the other electron. And it'll be proportional to the charge on the other electron. And it'll be delayed. The wave returns late. So all you've described is reflected light. Oh, oy. Oh, no, wait. Now let's just suppose, it returns by advanced waves. Reactions backwards in time. So it comes back at the right time. Here, give me your pencil. It's going to fit very nicely that way. Who's Putzie? [MUSIC PLAYING] RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: I was embarrassed about shaving my name off the pencils, but I did it anyway. Mustard? Yeah, mustard on both. RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: Then World War II started, and it got everybody's attention off themselves. Although not me, not entirely. My attention is usually somewhat on myself. Bill Price was head of the physics department, and one of my teachers at Princeton. That's all right that you told me the secret, because I'm not going to tell anybody about it. But I'm not going to do it. Want a bite? Don't you read the newspapers? Doesn't everybody read the newspapers for God's sake? Matter of fact, I don't. But I can't do anything about it now, you see. I wouldn't know how to handle it. My fiancée is sick. I don't know what's gonna happen next. Can't you get somebody else? I can't get you someplace else. Thanks. Is anybody else trying to separate uranium? Do you think the Germans are? I personally think they are, yes. Well, how do you know? I don't mean to be rude. I don't know. I don't think anyone knows for sure. It's very much of a fright, isn't it? Will I get paid? I don't want him to marry anybody who's sick let alone contagious. What do you think, I'm cruel? He's 23. There's a life to be had. How is he going to be a scientist? He'd be happy as a scientist. What does he got marry her for? Why can't he just be her friend? They used to care if their women had strong teeth, for God's sakes. He's going to get sick. Richie, you listen. We are very, very careful already. You explain how you catch it, and we'll figure it out. You cannot be sure. Tuberculosis is a great masquerader. How will you ever know if you're safe? Richie, darling, I don't want to sound callous. But when you made that promise to Arline, you did not know the situation. Now did you? Every-- everyone knows that. It does not represent a real promise. No one expects you to keep it. Least of all Arlene's parents, or Arline herself. It isn't a question of a promise. I never even thought of that. Well you'd better think of it. At least you better think. Would it be sensible for a husband who learns that his wife has tuberculosis to leave her? What are you talking about? We've been going together for six years. You want me to leave her? Stop it, all ya. There's no problem, really. How are you going to convince me of anything anymore, anyway? I'm working on a project for the government. I'm getting paid. This way I can take care of her at last. OK? Come on, Pop. You may kiss the bride. Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. Thank you. Should have kissed them and tipped you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Stop it. Stop it, you're driving. Isn't it wonderful? Are you listening? What do you even need notes for? [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: In the end, they didn't use the Princeton project for separating uranium. They decided we'd all go to Los Alamos, New Mexico, where we would make the bomb. Arline wasn't feeling too well at the time, and she was scared she'd be left behind. Her parents really didn't want to see her go, but we didn't want it to be left out of the excitement. So we figured she'd come afterwards by herself. I thought you might like this. It's for the train trip. It's going to last three nights and two days. Hah, oh Richie, it's so cute. Oh, Richie. It's so cute. [PLAYING PIANO] RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: It was Oppie who chose the west. Robert Oppenheimer. He knew the west. He'd had a summer home there. He was the head of the whole shebang. Oppie paid attention to everybody's problems. He arranged for Arline to have a roomette on a separate train when she was well enough. He arranged for the hospital in Albuquerque too. He did all that, and he probably wouldn't have recognized me. [MUSIC PLAYING] Looks like injun country. It is. [INSECTS BUZZING] Look, you can see it's black from their smoke from their fires. My God. Arline's got to see this. Who's Arline? My wife. Oh, your wife's with you? Yeah. Well, she will be. She'll be at the hospital in Alberquerque. She's not here now. Well. [MUSIC PLAYING] [CAR ENGINE] Um, sorry. Uh, um, Ernest. That's taken. Sorry. [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Come in. We're gonna get some dinner, Dick. Do you wanna come? Sure. Do you have a woman in here? Wha-- what is all this? Oh, I just want the room to look taken. I don't want to share it with anyone. Listen, I'll meet you guys in the dining room, OK? I think I'll get my mail. Oh my god. I'll have her killed. [TRAIN ENGINE] [MUSIC PLAYING] Thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: But it was a hard thing for us, you know? Albuquerque was 100 miles from Los Alamos. After a while I settled down so I could see it was the most wonderful landscape you could imagine. Like being in the movies not at them. I used to hitch a bus down on a Saturday. See Arline in the afternoon, and maybe stay overnight in a hotel in Albuquerque. Then on Sunday morning, I would see Arline again and go back in the afternoon. I never knew how I'd find her. One time she was dressed up as a shepherdess or something. She'd sent me a picture of a stove. Arline, what is this? Oh, it's a stove. Yeah, I can see that. It's huge. You think so? I thought we should have a stove. But this is a restaurant stove. Well maybe a little cooker, or a charcoal broiler. Arline, dear, they don't let you cook in a hospital room. There's too much smoke. I wanted to have steaks. It's the season for it. I bet everybody's doing it. We could do it on the lawn. No, we can't do that. With the cars driving back and forth, and people walking back and forth on the sidewalk. We can't go out on the lawn and cook steaks. I think it's a lovely place. You don't have to wear the hat, I guess. I got it for you just last week. Arline. What do you care what other people think? I really don't understand what you're saying, and I would like to. Well you don't know the language. No, that's true. I don't. Still you ought to be able to tell me in a way I'd understand. All I want is the flavor of it. Well, that's all you need. Well then why is it any different from when you cook that chop? You must be changing it altogether just by heating it. Well, it's sort of the same. Only bigger. When you cook the chop, you're adding energy to it, but not enough to mess with the nucleus. You're not taking any energy out of the atoms. Well it sure looks like you are. Yeah, but you're not. Look, the nucleus of an atom is where the neutrons and the protons are. Different elements have different numbers of neutrons and protons. That's what makes them different elements. But the neutrons and protons are always the same. OK? OK. All right, now, some nuclei hold together very well. But some nuclei are unstable. So the neutrons fall off of them. When? When what? When do they fall of them? Well it's completely uncertain when they'll do it. But it's completely certain that in the long run they will do. It's called Beta decay. Can I go on? OK, sorry. Now look, sometimes they shoot off an extra neutron. And if that neutron hits another unstable nucleus it'll cause it to split, and emit more neutrons, and then more nuclei. And like that you start a chain reaction. But you have to have a very crowded situation because otherwise they don't hit anything. They just go flying off. What you want, when it's all going right, is for everybody to be hitting everybody else and not too many missing targets. That is nuclide. Do you ever pretend you're a neutron, I mean, to figure out what they do? You're very smart. You're probably smart enough to have a fellow like me. What's the matter? There's a lot of gum under this table. There's a certain kind of uranium. Uranium is an element that has a very heavy nucleus. It's very unstable. And if we can get enough of that together at once, which we haven't done yet. We'll have a bomb. And we have to stop it from going off before we want it to. We don't know how to do that yet either. Well has this happened before what you're doing? I mean in nature? No I don't think it has. I don't think it's ever been strung together to make an explosion before. That's what we're so excited about. How you feeling today? Well, I feel good. You look good. Well that's nice to hear. You always look adorable. Hello! My husband is a physicist! Please don't do that. Don't wave at the car. OK, OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] [ARLINE COUGHING] I gotta go. Yeah, mm you look so handsome. You got a list? Yeah, let me think. Wait. You look real rested. Mmm. I need glycerine, mmm rubber cement, hot dogs. How many? Six. And you have my laundry. So OK. OK. What's the idea trying to get the name of the pencils, huh? Aren't you proud of the fact that I love you? What do you care what other people think? Afternoon sir. See some ID please? You got a light? Sure. RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: Two years went by, and I kept visiting Arline weekends and living at Los Alamos. Can I take a look at your briefcase sir, if I could. RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: Their security was exaggerated, and at the same time, it was absolutely ridiculous. SOLDIER: Good afternoon, sir, could I take a look at some ID please? Billson? Got a cousin named Billson. All right sir, thanks very much. Let me take a look in your briefcase if I could. Torrez, Torrez. What is that-- it's all right. What is that Mexican, Torrez? Mr. Fayman? Feyman. You've been through here before? Yeah. Did you come in this way? No. So how come you keep going out if you didn't come in? Corporal. RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: And, of course, his natural reaction was to call the lieutenant and try to put me in jail for doing this. I explained to the lieutenant that there was a hole, but they were both more interested in how suspicious I was than in the hole in their security. [WHISTLING] RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: The IBM calculators were supposed to help figure out exactly what happened during the bomb's implosion. So we could figure out exactly how much energy was released and so on. Come in. All right, OK. RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: I was in charge of a bunch of kids who were picked right out of high school because they were good at math. People do better if they know what they're doing. But nobody had told them anything, so these guys were kind of slow. So that's what we're doing. We're fighting the war? Yeah. What did you guys think we were doing? I don't know. I-- like supplies, uniforms. Making designs on cards. Examination results. Yeah you know like ordinance. Ordinances is guns, you dummy, not uniforms. But that's great. You mean everybody here is working on the same problem? That's right. One way or another. So how many people are here, I mean living here? About 5,000. Hey I saw Enrico Fermi. I saw Wigner. I saw Niels Bohr. He doesn't live here. He's just visiting. So now it's interesting. It's exciting, right? It's an event. Only you gotta pay attention. Three answers in nine months is no use to us. We're not calculating candy wrappers. You're not listening. I am listening. Listen. [TAPPING] [SINGING]- In my arms, in my arms ain't I never going to get a girl in my arms. In my arms, in my arms. Ain't I never going to get a bundle of charms? All right Let's go to work. Just wanted to show you fellas there's other ways. Wake you fellas up. Shake you fellas alive. We've gotta design a faster system. You mind turning that song off. I can't think. Some kids will play with anything. They don't have any respect for their tools. [LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: One time the bus broke down, and by the time I got to the hospital visiting hours were over. RICHARD: OK, we're going to do an experiment. It says here all about how good bloodhounds are at smelling. But how good are we actually? Those Coke bottles-- you haven't touched any of those for a couple of days, right? That's right. So I'll go out, you pick one of the bottles, handle it for a few minutes, and then put it back in. OK. It's absolutely obvious. The damn thing is warm and dampish. Those books over there-- you haven't looked at them in a while, right? When I go out, take one book off the shelf and just open it. That's all. Then put it back. It's very different. The others have a very dry, uninteresting smell. Take off your shoes and walk around the room and don't tell me where you went. ARLINE: How can you be so happy? What? Why are you so happy sniffing? Your eyes light up and all. Maybe you're not too happy. Well I'm here with you. For now. I'm working with the most wonderful people in my field. I'm married to you. Why aren't you afraid of what you're doing? Of what is going on here? I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm just, I'm alone an awful lot. [PLAYING PIANO] I don't feel so good. I think I stayed up too long last night waiting for you. All right. Too many overnights. C'mon. [MUSIC PLAYING] [DRUMMING SOUNDS] You hear that? Yeah. What's been going on? What the hell is that? You thinking wild Indians? No, I'm thinking Dick Feynman. RICHARD: [CHANTING] help us Rabbi, help us, help us, help us, help us help us, Rabbi. Oh, help us Rabbi bum bum bum. Awumbum bum. Awumbum bum. Big chief wumbum bum, big chief. Richard Feynman. Help us, help us Rabbi, help us Rabbi. Help us. Big chief NURSE: Oh dear, again? I'm sorry. Here. I'm trying to find a way to get you up a bit without it being too uncomfortable. Maybe I can do it in that chair. Can you? Oh dear. I'd better call the doctor. - Why? What is it? NURSE: 102.7. Please don't call the doctor, Kate. It's been there before. It's just a night sweat. Who's on? It's Dr. Robelarti, isn't it? Yes. - Don't call him. - He's the medical intern. He doesn't know anything. I'm not going to listen to anything he says. Is Porter on? No, he's coming in the morning. Sometimes I feel like if I could just die and get it over with. I'd still be around, but I wouldn't have all of this getting sicker and dying. Maybe we should call your husband? No, no. No he's nervous enough already. It's good that I got sweat. I'll feel cooler when it's over. ARLINE: I was thinking about a painting. It's at the Frick. Have you ever been there? On 70th and Manhattan. Your mother used to take me and-- she used to take me and Joanie in sometimes. This painting is maybe two 1/2 by three 1/2. It's this young woman. She's got a tortoise comb in her hair. And these sausage curls like plump, plump, plumb like that. At least change the outline. And she's got a handkerchief, or a fan, and these grey gloves with these lively lines painted on it like it was done yesterday. Listen, I can't take you to the museum to see the picture. But I can take you someplace equally as nice. Where? How? Well I asked Dr. Nebart, and it's OK if you feel up to it. And I got a car. - You do? Yeah? Now? Yeah. If you feel up to it. I hope I do. OK. [MUSIC PLAYING] [BIRD CALL] RICHARD: Ever since we came I've been dying to see this. ARLINE: You haven't seen it before? RICHARD: No. I was wanting so much to bring you here. ARLINE: Are these house foundations? RICHARD: Yeah. The rooms are so small. How did they get water? RICHARD: Uh, there's a river over there. ARLINE: Oh. RICHARD: It's this way. ARLINE: How long do you think it took them think to move out of caves and live in houses? I-- I think actually it went the other way. Did it? Yeah. Oh. Oh, look at the light. Look at the beautiful light. They used to freeze to death in those houses, I think? This whole cliff faces south. So then in the winter, when the sun is low in the sky, they keep warm. And then in the summer I guess they keep cool too. [MUSIC PLAYING] Somebody had to think of it though. Somebody climbed up here, and they said, what are you doing living in a hole? And he said, I don't know. I like it. Maybe he liked living in holes. You could put shelves over there. And I could change my clothes over there. And over here maybe I could build an oven. [LAUGHING] Or a warming place anyway. I thought we would feel less alone here. This, this isn't real mayonnaise. I couldn't get Hellman's. Hey, that couldn't be the same smoke from hundreds of years ago could it? No. Although I think it is. It's never going to stay. [LAUGHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [WIND BLOWING] ARLINE: You could still think they're all here. RICHARD: Yeah. ARLINE: The elders, their families. RICHARD: Dancing around in circles. [COUGHING] What were the people like who live here? What was their religion? What did they believe in? Well, you know that hole back there the round one? Yeah. That's a kiva. That's their kind of church. They worship down. There's another one on top. That's a hole too. What do you mean? I mean they worship down. Don't you think that's strange? I don't know. You don't? What are you sore at? Was it really 800 years ago that they were here? What does it matter? Here, you should be up. Here, it's getting cold. Here. My father used to talk about-- that a leaf with a brown line on it-- that a bug was born where the line began. And it spent its whole life eating its way to the edge. And then it just flies away. He had the wrong bug in mind. He'd say a maggot for a beetle, for instance. But he had the principle of the thing. Whatever, whoever it was that flew away, it just laid an egg on another leaf and the whole thing starts over again. It's terrible isn't it? Is it? How do you know? You're a dope. You are. You are and don't kick the wall. [MUSIC PLAYING] That first night when I came to your house, I couldn't find it it was so dark. I had to feel for the number. I think I'm a very lucky woman to have Richard Feynman for a friend. Want some tea? Yeah. [MUSIC PLAYING] RADIO VOICE: From headquarters, supreme commander, Allied Expeditionary Force: I have the rare privilege of speaking for the victorious army of almost 5 million fighting men. They and the women who have so ably assisted them, constitute the Allied Expeditionary Force that has liberated Western Europe. They have destroyed or captured enemy armies totaling more than their own strength. And swept triumphantly forward over the hundreds of miles separating Schubert from Rubech, Leipzig, and Munich. The complete armed of liberty and freedom is at last free to turn from the elimination of the principal criminal to the punishment of its equally despicable satellite. Japan herself must now realize her fate is sealed. RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: So there finally came VE day, which means, for those of you who are young enough to be told, Victory in Europe Day. Actually Tuesday, May 8th 1945. RICHARD: Whatever victory means. Breaking into concentration camps sure means something. It sure does. But victory? Would you call that a lasting state? Or even a state at all really? RICHARD: My god, look at them. BOY: I can't. Gotta use the phone. Just don't use it up. Ho, ho. Presbyterian Hospital. I swear this is the first paper I've seen since we got here. RICHARD: Hello, uh Richard Feynman. You mean bona fide American newspaper? BOY: I do. Hello doctor. TELEPHONE VOICE: Uh, Mr. Feynman? Yeah, yeah well I figured you might be trying to get me. TELEPHONE VOICE: Yes, I am. RICHARD: What? He says it's a sad day for this to happen. Why? I beg your pardon? TELEPHONE VOICE: Mr. Greenbaum is here. RICHARD: He is? Well, when did he get there? TELEPHONE VOICE: Early this morning. Well you told Mr. Greenbaum to hang on, and I'll be there as quick as I can, OK? I'm on my way. [MUSIC PLAYING] RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: I'd already borrowed a car for just this emergency. It was Klaus Fuchs' car. He was the spy in the Rosenberg case, and it was the car that he used. I didn't know that then, but that's another story. Where you from? Aaron Garricador. That's your name or where you're from? Yes, I believe so. Oh boy. Aaron what? Garricador. Gar-- Garr-- Garr-- Garri-- Gari. Aaron Gari. It's gotta be just so, huh? Aaron Garricador. [MUSIC PLAYING] RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: When I think about that drive now, it seems to me like a nightmare diagram drawn out flat on the desert. There were no roads leading from that car. Where are you going? Albuquerque. Get in. Thanks very much. I thought there'd be more cars. [MUSIC PLAYING] RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: Or they were blind roads. An infinite number of them that you couldn't see along beyond the blink of an eye. [THUDDING] [BRAKES SCREECHING] HITCHHIKER: Oh, c'mon. Jesus, god. You going to complain or you're going to help out? What do you think I pick up hitchhikers for? You late for something? No. Oh. Pardon the intrusion. My wife is in the hospital in Albuquerque. They called me to come. I'm sorry to hear that. [CAR ENGINE HUMMING] [THUDDING] MAN'S VOICE: Hey, hey hey hey hey hey. Don't bring that in here. You can't see. RICHARD: It's OK. It's OK. We'll just wait. Don't worry about it. We'll just wait. [MUSIC PLAYING] NURSE: Mr. Greenbaum. Mr. Greenbaum. I'll come in now. You go and have your breakfast. MR. GREENBAUM: [WHISPERING] Arline. Arline. [HEAVY BREATHING] ARLINE: Yes? MR. GREENBAUM: She doesn't know who I am? NURSE: She's a little vague now. This is all baloney, huh? I should just start again. Should go back to Los Alamos. I can't keep it all in my mind. Maybe it doesn't matter. What? If I can't go, I can't go. I'm stuck. I'm-- I'm just stuck. This gentleman here, his wife is dying in the hospital in Albuquerque. He has not much time. That is the situation. This other tire ain't worth fixing. Piece of crap. Let's find a good one. You blew your cover. [MUSIC PLAYING] She's still with us. She didn't even know me. I have to go home now, Richard. MR. GREENBAUM: I have to go home now. [MUSIC PLAYING] Was that my father? ARLINE: Dad? Richie? It's Richie. Here. I was just wondering. Those particles that go flying around. Can they hit people? Yes, they can. Do they hurt? No. They can't feel them. Oh, that's good. RICHARD: They can make people sick though. A lot? A lot of what? ARLINE: Particles. Neutrons. About 20%. About 20% of the energy that goes off is radiation. We shouldn't talk here. Can people be radioactive? RICHARD: What? Can people-- can people spew out particles? What? This is one thing. If-- if they make you sick, and I have to leave-- I was just wondering-- will you be all right? Yeah. Yeah. I'll be all right. [HEAVY BREATHING] [MUSIC PLAYING] RICHARD: Well can you do that? No, we can't. It's a law. Where is the funeral parlor? Would it be open this late? No it wouldn't. Not until 8:30. Where will you stay? You ought to sleep, Mr. Feynman. We can take care of everything tomorrow morning. Do you know where the Western is? Or the Fairfield? That's only three blocks. The Fairfield? Here. I'll write down the address funeral-- Take care of the photograph albums, will you? Yeah. [THEME MUSIC] RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: In the morning, I ordered a coffin. I took her home to Cedarhurst to her parents. And I went home to mine. WOMAN'S VOICE: Private Jay Donald Meehan. Next line. Three, two, five, six, three, seven, zero, two. Headquarters company. RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: I had tried every way in the world to get to Arline. But I couldn't catch up. She was leaving faster than I was going. WOMAN'S VOICE: Next line. Care of post master. New York, New York. [MUSIC PLAYING] [KNOCKING ON DOOR] - Heya, Pop. - Richie. Hey. Oh darling. Darling. How are ya? How are you? Better take my bag up. Here, let me-- let me-- let me take it. Hey look. Do you mind if I went for a quick walk? No. Of course not. I don't go into town much, but there's such jerks out there. You know what they call their supermarket? The super piggly wiggly. How come you're not there? Because they didn't need me. I remember the day you met her. Remember? That was when we used to fight all the time about how you thought girls were awful. Remember? And I used to object, after all, me being one of them. And I came home from school, and I just had a terrible fight with my best friend Wendy. Do you remember Wendy? Of course. And I came tearing into your room saying, you're right, you're right. Girls are awful. And you were sitting on your bed. You had your arms wrapped around one knee, and you were looking up at the ceiling. And you said, oh no they're not. I just met a wonderful girl. Remember it like yesterday. The only difference for me and Arline was instead of 50 years we had nine years. It was only a quantitative difference. We had a hell of a good time together. You're making me cry. What's the matter with you? Use the old beano. Everybody dies. It doesn't stop the world at all. What do you mean I'm making you cry? [MUSIC PLAYING] Yes, I'll repeat that. New Mexico July 11. The baby is expected on July 16th. Yes, I'll give it to him now. You're welcome. You know somebody who's having a baby? No. You don't expect me to believe that, do you? No, Pop. No. You think I'm crazy. No, no. Sometimes you're a very nervous person. And you're a little nervous now. [THEME MUSIC] RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: How can I tell you now what we felt then? We hadn't seen any pictures of Hiroshima. MAN'S VOICE: I'm giving odds we blow up the state of New Mexico. Any takers? MAN'S VOICE: How could I collect? Five hippopotamus, four hippopotamus, three hippopotamus two hippopotamus, one. [MUSIC PLAYING] [EXPLOSION] Gesundheit. [THEME MUSIC] [RUMBLING] RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: Isidor Rabi said, it did bring home to one how terrible this thing was that treated humans as matter. [RUMBLING] Christ. [MUSIC PLAYING] RICHARD [VOICEOVER]: It was all very top secret. The thousands of people at Los Alamos weren't supposed to know anything about it. I hate secrets. Hi. Hey. Hi, Henry. Hello. RICHARD: [SINGING] I want a dish of virgin sturgeon. Virgin sturgeon's a very fine dish. Virgin surgeon needs no urging. That's why virgin is dish, swish wish wish. I want a dish of virgin Sturgeon. Virgin sturgeon's very fine fish. RICHARD AND BOY: [SINGING] Virgin surgeon needs no urging. That's why surgeon is my dish, fish swish swish. Hey, Henry. Did you know that there are twice as many numbers as numbers? Oh come on Dick. There are. Let me show you. Name a number. One million. Two million. 27. 54. Now you try. Six. 12. Six million. 12 million. Light beginning to dawn? So there are three times as many numbers as there are numbers. Prove it. You know. Three times anything. You say five, I say 15. Or I say 5,000,000,473-- Three times that. So is a biggest number? Well how can there be? So that idea-- the idea that there's no end to how big a number can be-- that's called infinity. Ah rats. You out of cokes? Worse. How do you mean? Beer. Huh. I'll get you some. Want to take a trip with me, Henry? Oh, no. Don't worry about it. I'll get you some. What are you looking for? Keys. Fuchs usually leaves his keys here. It's parked outside my door. It's very quiet here. Mmm. So now we're all sons of bitches. [MUSIC PLAYING]
