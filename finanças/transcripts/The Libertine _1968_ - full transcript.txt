THE LIBERTINE Five-three. It's my serve. Only to think that I was playing tennis when... It's only three days since. What a relief. Mimi... Mother, you never understand anything. With all due respect, Franco. That's how I am. I cannot cry. Perhaps I'm insensitive. Blast. I know what you're feeling, my child. A mother understands these things. And it's not too long since your father... God forgive him... left us. These sandwiches are awful. As a matter of fact, who cares about food on a day like this? I do care. I'm hungry, even on a day like this. This won't satisfy my appetite. My dear, this is Toni. He'll take you home. But sleeping here, it's even better. Such a big empty house is so sad. You told Maria you wouldn't come 'until tomorrow, didn't you? So what? So what, what? I don't mind being alone. Finally alone. Don't be so shocked. I meant without Maria getting on my nerves. Darling, you're so pale. Why don't you have a check-up. - Toni would be glad to... - By all means. My clinic is at your disposal. A little examination won't hurt anyone. And mother would be able to relax. I'll think about it. - Let Toni drive you home, darling. - That's what I'm here for. No, don't bother. I'll call a cab. You frightened me to death. Maria, I thought you'd return tomorrow. - Yes, but... - Never mind, it doesn't matter. Would you mind sleeping in the other room? - In...? - In my bed. I'll sleep here. It's ridiculously big. It's funny being the proprietor, and never coming here. Yes, it's funny. I'm careless. I need a signature. - Where do I sign? - Here. Tell me, surely you're aware of a property called A.Z.? I'm not aware of anything. It's not long ago that I heard talk of it. It's an office on Avenue des Deux Tours, as it seems... Yes, that's it. 37, Avenue des Deux Tours. Good. And what about it? Well, I found no official paper regarding this apartment. We are in a dense fog. No post, no messages at the concierge... Nothing at all. Except the sale contract, which is about... two and a half years old. And no keys. Who knows? Perhaps he wanted to hide his profits, or... - A kind of warehouse. - Yes, that may be it. What if there's somebody there? We'll see. This is an answering machine. You have a minute for leave a message. Please talk. This is Franco's voice. Hello, playboy. Have you died? A week has already gone since you called me. The little saint is monopolizing you? Kisses. Ciao. "Little saint..." I bet she means me. Bitch. But the playboy is dead, and I confess I don't really care. Cheers, cuckold. But... But what are they doing? Seems to be Claudia. Yes, it's Claudia, indeed. My best friend. I understand why they call me "the little saint". However, it's madness. I've been living three years with a sex maniac, and I never realised it. What an idiot... What the hell, he could have told me. I suppose he was respecting me. One ought to respect one's wife. Impossible. Look at him playing the doctor. The blouse, the stethoscope... He didn't forgot anything. What an imagination. Now I understand his scenes when I returned from the doctor. And I thought he was jealous. What an idiot one can be sometimes. Look at that. Claudia again. He's beating her. Very good, let him beat her. Seems she likes it. Quite a lot. When I think that I helped her to choose her underwear. There's probably a serious book about this. Interested? An excellent one. Very serious. If you want to see others too... I have plenty, with pictures very... - No, thanks. How much? - This one? 2.000. If you want others... - With pictures. Yes? No? - I said no. Just that? "Science has torn "the veil of mystery which has so long covered "everything related to sex." "Our time, which pretends to be enlightened, rejects little by little "all the taboos that disturb the sexual life." "In this area, nothing... "In this area, nothing is a priori unnatural. "Nihil mirari,/i> the old saying, fits best here. - Mimi, do you hear me? - Yes, mother, I hear you. - What are you doing? - Studying. - What? Psycho... Latin. - And your check-up? - I've no reason to have one. - Do me a favour. Let's meet one day. "In this chapter we shall examine the case of persons "who are sexually excited using obscene language, "hurting their partner, sometimes even killing them." Killing them... "Binet claims, in "Fetishism in Love", that erotic stimulation is often caused by inanimate objects, "such as a piece of clothing. "But most often, the fetishistic attention will be focused "on a part of the body: an ear, the nose, "the hair, a leg, or even a malformation. "The object may be a piece of underwear, a shoe. "Some people might like to drink from the lover's shoe". - Are you following me? - No. I'm with some clients. - Would you like a drink? - No. I'm going to take a shower. I just had an idea. We could have diner together tonight. You need to have a little fun, to change your ideas. No? You don't think so? I never said anything particularly funny. No. You're right. Don't know what's up with me. Sorry for tonight. I have... to study. By the way, I found the key from the office avenue des Deux Tours. Come take a look. Tomorrow, for instance, what're you doing? I'll come by 16:30. Alright? It takes quiet music... to create ambience. The main gadgets, of the seducer. Mimi, I... Follow me. You've seen nothing yet. Unless you've already been here. I didn't even think about it. I had only business relations with your husband. Good. We'll check it. He made a dossier on every adherent. Do you like it? The visit gives you the right to the gallery of mirrors. And here's the bed refused to legitimate wives. Nice, isn't it? And here, the alphabetical list. Therefore, the class book. "The class book?" "Claudia, Julia, Marjorie, "Mme Thomson and Valérie." - Who's Valérie? - No idea. Gets an excellent grade. Let's see. "Imagination: 28. Experience: 32. Good will: 35." A champion. Don't pay it too much attention. It's natural to... And I'm not in. - In what? - In the adherents' register. I hope so. After all, you were his wife. Of course. The same old refrain: the legitimate wife is sacred. You do everything with all, except your wife. You were bored together? I beg your pardon? You and Franco. I was. Yes, I was bored. Him, I don't know. But I was. And the funniest thing is... I never realised it. Until today. Franco was the only man in my life. And I always thought that between us there was... I mean... Finally, I didn't even guess that there could be... Mimi, you're not a child anymore. What have I done that's so awful? I got eyes. It's natural for me to admire you. Bless you. Coward. - You're all the same. - It's not true. Not true. Arpeggio. - What are you doing? - Taking your clothes off. What are you doing? Caressing you. What are you doing? I'm taking my clothes off. He'll ask me to forgive him. I don't know what got into me. Mimi, forgive me. I'm awfully sorry. I feel guilty. It's true... Please, listen to me. Mimi, you aren't even listening. But what is it? I'm very sorry. Please forgive me. I'm not proud of myself. In fact, Franco was my best friend, Mimi. You speak only banalities. What if we discuss it seriously? What grade would you give me? - I beg your pardon? - You heard me clearly. - Well, you give me the grade? - No. You're joking, aren't you? And no favouritism. So... If we begin with experience? The truth? Insufficient. Let's say 25. Even a schoolgirl can do better. - Imagination? - There too one can improve. You still have some inhibitions. I'll give you 20, but I'm generous. Good will? Extraordinary. Not just on the podium, but right after. And, if you want, the reward won't be just a vulgar diploma... No. Listen to me. I want things to be clear. I wasn't seduced in any way. I didn't, did I? I seduced you. "Ball describes the case of an epileptic with sadistic tendencies "who, at the climax, bit their partner's nose and swallowed it." I'm very sorry, Mimi, but I'll have to hurt you a little. Do you have, by chance, sadistic tendencies? You know, I don't hurt people out of pleasure. I'm a dentist and must force myself to forget the sufferings I inflict on others. Or to change my profession. Open your mouth. It hurts. Don't forget that. Would you mind not talking with your mouth full? That's it. Mimi, enough. I might hurt you, if you go on like this. Open your mouth. Like that. Don't bite. Mimi. Relax. Don't mess with my nerves. Have mercy. - Try to forget, as you say. - I'm talking about physical pain, my client's, not mine. You're suffering too? Mimi, don't push me. Why not? I bet he'll lock the door. Shouldn't you oppose me, or slap me? For what reason? I don't feel like changing my dentist. It's so easy to park one's car in front of your office. No. It's long. But you've made great progress. A few lessons more, and then the classification. And a little more flexibility, though. Let yourself go. Are you tired? - I made you suffer, didn't I? - What? Look at my beautiful muscles. What do you think about it? For the world loves what is beautiful. - But... It's the men's room here. The shower is... - Really? This is the men's show... Prove it to me. No, listen... Oh. I'm in training. I must keep in training. "Morphologically, it's interesting to note "the odd relations there may be, for example, "between the nose and certain erogenous zones. "In fact, it has been seen that sexual arousal "is expressed in some people through nasal irritation, "which often provokes sternutations to the subjects." And to think that for three years I thought I had hay-fever. - I've got spare seat, fancy a lift? - Yes, I was expecting you. Sorry for the delay, but I've been to a wedding. He thinks I walk the streets. He may be a pimp. I forgive you. But next time you'll make amends. Something's not quite right here? Yes. Well, maybe not, but does it matter? No. Not at all. - Thanks. - Well, that's it. I forgot. But... No... I wouldn't like to... What? Are you having a laugh? Cause I must tell you... you were worth it. Avenue des Parmes. How amusing, that hairstyle. In fact, you did it as a posthumous revenge. - Maybe. So what? - You had me on hand, but it could have been another. You don't care about me. Shall I see you again? No. Let's leave it as it is. It doesn't matter to you. With me or with another. The last few days you've become a real house of ill repute just by yourself. I bet you had me followed. Poor Sandro. You just can't take it. You're a whore. I'm giving myself to everybody? I don't want you anymore, and you can't stand it. Do you know those variety shows? Thirty seconds to give the answer, and only the first counts. Do you want to marry me? Mimi, are you drunk, or what? Come on. Answer, Sandro. No hesitation. I'm not the woman to marry. Or not anymore. I didn't say that. But that's what he meant. Franco thinks there are two kind of women: wives and the others. Mimi, how are you? In what category should I place Claudia? For her husband, she's the woman to marry. But for mine? Can I share this good mood? What tough, handsome face. - Bless you. - Thanks. Do we know each other? We were just introduced. Really? I live in Africa. I'm just passing. - Exciting. - If you like it. Dear friend, my father-in-law wants to see you. The reason of my visit. Yes. Later. - Are you enjoying it? - Yes, very much. I drink... to Mimi. - But... - No. For Mimi. - My forever friend. - Thank you. Nice toast. An old family friend, but, alas, your best friend's husband. - Fabrizio... - I'm really serious. I admire you. I admire you. I'm honest, like a father, an uncle, or more like a brother. Yes, but no incest. Don't take him seriously. He'll soon become lyrical. - Did he tell you he loves you like a brother? After that, he usually sends flowers. It's the beginning of the end: after some night calls, he's already has another passion on his mind. Fortunately, I've got many friends. I fear the day when he'll start hunting unknown women. We should see each other more often. After all, we have a widowhood in common. You have a lovely dress. - Yours too, Claudia. - You think so? It's a model from "Chez Denise". Do you know her? I should take you there. Now she's preparing her new Autumn collection. You'll like her style. It's your type. Agreed. I'll come. - What's that? - What's what? It's just my necklace. Wait a minute. Look. It's a very special jewel. A beetle? - Is it a good luck charm? - In a way. - If you like creepy crawlies. - It's wonderful. But it's real. Yes, when it's awake. Upon my word, she's in love with her beetle. When it moves, it's gorgeous on skin. But it's usually asleep. But what are you doing? Want you wear it a while? I'll lend it. Better not. I'm afraid I might crush it. I wouldn't make a fuss. It's only an insect. In fact, there are many others. Same as men. I wonder why we fight for compulsory education more than for optional ignorance? It is equally valid. Here you are again talking nonsense. It's his obsession. When he begins, you just can't stop him. If we resume where we left off? - You've been in Russia, I think? - Yes, that's right. - What do you think of it? - The food is ghastly. - You're already friends? - Yes, almost. We're exchanging our phone numbers. - You live here? - In a manner of speaking. I suppose not. Why are you defending yourself? Why don't you abandon yourself to me? Come on. More than that. You were very rushed or are you always like that? It amuses me. When I was a child, I loved to destroy. - I tore up my school books. - Couldn't have helped your studies. I made a transfer of interest in this area, at the right time. Don't you like it? You don't have to tell me. Pity, you've got everything. But you don't let yourself go. That's right. And I won't change now. I admit I don't like making love. Maybe it's foolish. I hate being hurt and insulted. It's a way, like any other. And I don't like that my expensive dress should be torn. But there are many women who enjoy being tortured. And then, if you loved me, with a little practice, you would find pleasure in it too. But maybe I could try to love you. No, it's useless. I'm going back to Africa. You knew it, didn't you? Why couldn't I go there? No. I would have too many things to do. I won't have time. I'm not your type. What's this? A sample of pop art? A banknote I earned. The only one I deserved. It's a kind of... souvenir. I see. Good bye, Mr. What's-Your-Name. I don't even know his name. That's a shame. And for him, after this... fight, he can't say he doesn't know me. Well, have a nice trip, Mr. Tamer. Poor little insect... I saved you at the right moment, yesterday, from the brute's claws. "A man was attracted to a parrot. "He could hardly embrace it without being pecked. " The poor thing didn't like it. "Sexual excitement due to the presence of animals "is much more widespread than we think.'' Poor little beetle, you're only good for tickling me. I don't even know if you're male or female. Good. - It tickles. - So you like it? It's alive. Well, answer me. Do you like it? Don't be so alarmed. It's only a beetle. - Lower the sheet. It will tickle you. - No, it frightens me. Good. Very good. I suppose you and Aurelio, you do things. You've tried to do new stuff. - What does he do? - He's a plumber. Yes. I know. Come on. Won't you tell me? Please tell me. What exactly does he do to you? He bites you? He bites you, yes or no? He beats you, then. He does beat you. Good. What's wrong with you? Nobody speaks about you, no-one sees you anymore. All your friends keep calling me to ask about you. - And I don't know what to tell them. - Then tell them nothing. What's going on, Mimi? You must come to your senses, come on. What's done is done. You don't have to isolate yourself. Live. You're young and beautiful. Look, you've lost a few pounds. You don't want to end up in a convent. No. I've got other projects. Good. Then, let's begin with... I've finished what I had to do. What're you... what're you doing up there? Welding, as I was told. What impertinence. Go away. Don't you see she's...? Yes, I see her. And without glasses. Mother, what scenes you make. Why do you bother? It's only Aurelio, the plumber. Mimi, you're irresponsible. He's a part of the family. He's Maria's fiancé. I'll phone Toni for this famous check-up. I see it's become urgent. Congratulations for your fiancé. What is it, Maria? Someone just brought these flowers. - I beg your pardon? - Nothing. Poor Fabrizio... If Claudia's right, next are the night calls. What a surprise. Excuse me, but right now I'm alone. Claudia's off to some appointment, didn't you know? You're joking? It's I who arranged her appointment. So don't you want me? I was about to make tea, when you rang. Sunday, it's the maid's day off, and then... - That's why I came on a Sunday. - Would you like a cup of tea? Sorry. You were saying? I said: "Would you like a cup of tea?" But don't blame me if it's not to your taste. Just a minute. He won't forget to tell me about the roses. Did you... Did you get my roses? Yes, but I was expecting the next step: the phone call. If you believe what Claudia says... - It's your seduction technique. - Listen to me, Mimi. Don't make fun of me, please. All this is arranged with taste. Did you draw up the plans by yourself? Almost, yes. But Franco was he aware? For the gadgets, I mean. - The cinema. - You should have asked him. Or perhaps your wife. I'm sorry. I admit I was a little indiscreet. Life is short. We must live every day as if our last. - Don't you think? - Yes. You're right. But it's incredible how few are able to reach the end of their desires. I would like you one day, to meet a little friend I'm sure you would like. She's an extraordinary girl. And... if you agree, I will arrange a meeting. What do you say? Damn Fabrizio. I never doubted it. Can you tomorrow? If she scratches me, I'll scream. Go on, scream. I want to hear you scream. Louder. Come on, shout. No, not that. I order you to leave her alone. Miserable daughter of the jungle. Bloody brute. Drop that dagger. Otherwise, I will spill your blood. Stop it. No, go on. Stop it. Again. Have mercy. How I suffer. Here, on the belly. What a savage. Hit me more. Harder. No, it's too much, it's too much. That's great, that's great. See? She's torturing me. Stop it. I had enough. Mimi, why are you doing this? - I've seen enough. - But the pleasure is in the pain? It's just jam. You want to spoil my pleasure? Fabrizio, I'm sorry, but all this makes me laugh. I hope you thought not to eat before you came. Did you forget, or at least think about it? Yes or no? - No, I haven't eaten. - Is it the truth? It's very important for certain tests. Very good. I'll take you to my team. It's over. That's it. Vampire. Raise your arms. Stay still. A little more to the right. Don't breathe. Breathe. Please excuse me. Stop breathing. Breathe. Would you mind removing your knickers? Bless you. Breathe. Good. You can get down from the table. Didn't you see the step? That stupid question again. It was a suicide attempt. Show me your ankle. - Does that hurt? - A little, yes. Nothing is broken. For your safety, I'll take an X-ray. Can you walk? I don't know. - You don't know how it hurts - Really?. - I'll carry you. - What are you doing? I thought you'd take me in your arms. Didn't you read the Perfect Helper manual? I'll read it after I finish the memoirs of the divine marquis, I promise you. It's important to look where you put your feet, to avoid having two casualties instead of one. Hang on to my neck. - You're so light.... - Yes, so it seems. No, nothing. "Various literary sources describe Phyllis "astride Aristotle. "She refused him the gift of her virginity. "She accepts, however, to fulfil a request: "she rode Aristotle in the garden, and found in it a particular pleasure, "because she was dominating the man." - Madam, the professor is here. - Who? - The doctor. - Ah, Toni? Send him in. Take a seat, Toni. How long am I condemned to live? Probably a hundred years. You're healthy as a horse. Your ankle? What a funny clinic, where you enter in good health and leave an invalid. And yet, they still get out alive. Show me. Does it hurt? No wonder, with the weather outside. Finally, if the trick was good for Aristotle... Yes, it's much too hot. Say, Toni, would be so kind to take me on the terrace, some fresh air? - Be nice. - What are you saying? Want me to take you in my arms? No, one must avoid carrying somebody in one's arms. Didn't you read the Perfect Helper manual? The carrier must see where he's going or there'll be two injured instead of one. Very good. Now what? Well, on your back. On my back? On the terrace? - Ready? Go. - Dear me. - Your mother's not wrong, you'll never grow up. - Mother is never wrong. No, don't stop. Do the tour once more. You're mad, my dear. ''Once more''? All around? But they'll see us. - What Toni, in this weather? - Exactly. We have to go back. - No. - What you're doing? Please, Toni. Don't be mean. Please come back. - Come on, Mimi, call Maria. - It's useless, she won't hear me. Then I'll call her. I think it's useless. Stop laughing. It's raining. That's all we need. Where to hide from the rain? No. Go on playing horsey. - What? - I want to ride on your back. - On the roof? - No, around the terrace. Come on, Aristotle. Aristotle? But what's that got to do with Aristotle? I can heal your ankle, but for the rest you need a good psychiatrist. This I don't understand anymore. - Unless he's blackmailing you. - But what can he do to me? Of course, if it was just a simple plumber. It's Maria's fiancé. Maria always looks good, looking happy. I wanted to know why. Mimi, please be serious. It's about you. To understand what's wrong with you. One would say you're trying to destroy yourself. Mimi, you're... you're sick. Perhaps. Maybe I'm a nymphomaniac. I happen to be treated like a whore, but it's strange, dear Sandro: it is only when I say no, or when I don't want to say yes. Curious reaction, isn't it? There's another one burning in the ashtray. I don't want to interfere. It's really not my responsibility. Yes, that's right. But I don't know in advance whom I might meet. And trust I only you, Sandro. All right. But I don't want to be the confidant of your scandals. Sort it out yourself and be discrete. I hope you'll choose with more discernment. It's a promise. I'll only give myself to CEOs or freelancers. I swear. To examine a topic, you must choose the best angle. For instance, to look... For instance, to look at someone from the front is not the same thing as looking from behind. I knew that even without studying. You've not eaten your soup yet. It will be cold. Did Mr. Maldoni...? Didn't you tell him I was sleeping? - Yes, but... - He didn't believe you. - No, he didn't. - If he calls again, tell him the same. "The thermoelectric tube is connected..." There's a little error, there, under that thing. You mean the ultrasound thermoelectric tube. Shouldn't it be C, if the K level energy is equal to...? You know what I mean? Is this the first time you've attended our practical exercises? What is your name? - "Mimi"? - In fact, Marguerite. Perhaps he recognises my skeleton. - Are you deaf? - Are you in a hurry? Would you do some bibliographic research for me? - Well, in fact, I... - Yes or no? Aren't you hungry? - It's already 2:30. Aren't you hungry? - Well... - Are you interested in research? - Indeed... Why did you interrupt your studies? I got married. And now? I'm a widow. I see. - You already, ma'am? - Take these. Oh, what gorgeous flowers. "Sandro Maldoni. When will it end, "this endless sleep cure?" - Did Mr. Maldoni call me? - Yes, almost daily. I keep telling him you're sleeping, and then he hangs up and restarts. Very good. Keep telling him so. - And what is this, Maria? - It was brought an hour ago. My teacher. Very soon he will fall into temptation. No, it should not be Galilei. Maybe it's too early to talk about it, but... The day after tomorrow is Saturday, and... And...? - I've already mentioned the diggings? - What diggings? Yes, the diggings. We could go by car. We could take some air. Yes. Good idea. It's by the sea. There are important vestiges of Roman art. Doctor and archaeologist... I'll need patience and sprains. You were saying, doctor? We could go there. I'd be delighted. We'll have to spend the night there. We'll find a room, I hope. Very good. Well, it's ruins, what else? Think: they've lasted since the end of the Empire... Impressive. Architecture, archaeology are all right, but finally, it's time to go on... - Are you hurt? - My ankle. How fragile it can be. Show me. It doesn't seem very serious. Try to get up. - Piggy back. - I wanted Aristotle, I got him. I'll carry you. If he speaks again about the Perfect Helper manual, I'll slap him. - Come on, say that I'm light. - Fortunately, you're not heavy. It's at least 2 km from here to the car, but we'll make it. It's the same effect as with Toni. Are you sure we haven't met before? Well, I'm never sure of anything. I only have a double room. I'm sorry. Is there another hotel? There's one 30 km away, but the road is bad. And the only phone is at the post office, which is closed at this hour. It doesn't matter. We'll take the double room. You're tired, as I am. - I can sleep on the pool table. - No. I don't want you to do that. It's pointless. Professor, I'm ready, you can come in. Do you want to read? - May I put out the light? - Yes. Go ahead. May I put out the light? Are you asleep? I don't know why, but I've a strange sensation. Yes? Which one? Didn't you once sprain your ankle... in my office? Yes. And I'm not a university student either. I never have been. I've spent my nights learning your damned formulas. Enough. It's gone on long enough. Will you marry me? You needn't feel obliged. I never said so. - No, but... - But what? We barely know each other. - In the biblical sense, I do. - Don't joke about it. I'm serious. I'm not the woman you think. - Want to hear the story of my life? - Since your childhood? No. Since I being a woman. Are you having an affair? Are you in love with someone? - So? - Is there nothing worse than that? I'm listening. If you're too hot, I can adjust the ventilation. Don't stop. Don't stop, it's useless. May I know what you're up to? I want to make a scandal, so you know what I'm capable of. Remember Lady Godiva? Yes, very well. That lady who walked naked and didn't even make a scandal. But her hair was much longer than yours. What are you thinking? Starting to worry about your reputation? - Can I help you? - No, thanks. I'll handle it. - What are you doing? - Buying some petrol. - Aren't you taking off your knickers too? - You really want to buy petrol? No, I don't want to. I have to. I'm practically on empty. Refuel with Super. You won't take the key? Dino, the wind-shield. If we get out? You want something to drink? Some sugar? Wake up. We're here, Mimi. Wake up and tell me: when will you marry me? I want to sleep at least twelve hours. Yes, but first tell me when we'll get married. If you want an answer, come to 37, Avenue des Deux Tours, tomorrow at 12:30 sharp. There's no concierge, but it's very easy. Turn the handle and the gate will open. No, keep it. You'll catch cold. Keep it. Madam, wake up. It's 10 o'clock. - What? - It's 10 o'clock in the morning. I'm not surprised. Mr. Maldoni is waiting for you. -On the phone? - No, he's here. A whole hour. I said you were sleeping, that today it was true. But he didn't believe me. He said he wants to see you and will never leave the armchair. I'll finish my breakfast and come. What's happened to your dress? I can't find it anywhere. It must have been ironed on the highway. I realise you're offering me a worthwhile affair. Gentleman, good looking, bored of making out with secretaries, marries beautiful, young widow, of good family and dubious reputation, in order to enter into a comfortable and peaceful marriage. Laugh, if you like. The truth is... I'm in love with you. And how much time do I have to answer? - But what is holding you back? The Professor? Ah, you know it all. So you keep spying on me. I'm leaving in less than a fortnight. So? Do I have to decide right now? I don't have much time. I can take care of your visa. But you must get yourself vaccinated: cholera, typhoid, tuberculosis and yellow fever. That takes time. I'll give you three days, nothing more. Three days? - Do you want my passport? - It would be better. - Without obligation? - Not the slightest. Enough. Satisfied? You haven't presented it yet in a festival? It's an appreciated genre, right now. Good. Now I want to hear your answer. When will we marry? What's wrong with you, are you blind, stupid or sick? - You put your glasses on? - I always do when I watch movies. You saw your sweetheart illustrate all the chapters of the Kama-sutra. I saw my sweetheart ready to make love with curious partners and in various positions, which, I agree, demonstrate a certain... imagination. And you hate imagination. Absolutely not. I find it very important in sexuality, especially when it's applied to the bourgeois marriage. Don't you agree? - You're not serious. - I'm as serious as can be. For a woman, the most perfect lover must be the husband. And this diagnosis shows what? If you did it, then you had a reason. It was just because I wanted to. - Well, I want something myself. - What? You'll see. Don't do that. It's a valuable object. - When will we marry? Answer me. - Leave me alone. I swear you'll answer me. Why do you want a wife? To mend your socks? - Why not? - Or iron your shirts? Why not? It's become an obsession. - What you are doing? Stop. - What I should have done ages ago. When will we get married, Mimi? Answer. Stop it. Why do you want such an unfaithful wife? Another answer. - Don't you care if I'm unfaithful? - I'll take the risk. - When? - Never. So? When? Alright. I'll marry you. So, when? There is... This isn't all. You're frightening me, Mimi. Did you kill your husband? Worse. I have a terrible vice. Lovely ceremony, but I can't wait till they all go. It was boring like a funeral. Oh, what I did say? You see? Eventually, all went well. It was a lovely ceremony. Yes, it's true. But I couldn't wait to be alone with you. - Have you read Freud? - Freud? You think this is the moment? Yes. Freud knew very well how to explain certain things. Modern civilisation is based on suppression, on the repression of natural instincts. This makes man unhappy. - And women happy? - No. When I say "man" I mean humanity. I adore you. I adore you, my little horse. Sexuality is a serious, important thing, and must above all make you happy. Don't you think? It takes imagination. And absolute sincerity between partners. We must hide nothing from ourselves. Absolutely nothing. And we must learn to love life, considering it as a game, a game for two, where all is possible when we're love, even on horseback. - Are you tired? -No. Not at all. It's going very well. But I beg you, Mimi, try not to get too fat. Go on a little. I'm fine. And you? This is beautiful, love astride.
