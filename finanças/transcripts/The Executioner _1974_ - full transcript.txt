Bring them right away. Any way you can. Ryuichi Koga. A descendent of the head of Koga Ninja. Lost his parents in infancy. Struggles against his grandfather, Hakuunsai. KOGA, SHIGA PREFECTURE Ryuichi, can you jump that bamboo? Making fun of me? You think I'm just a kid. A FEW MONTHS LATER Think of these bamboo tips as spearheads. If you touch it, you bleed. This is stupid. Ryuichi. Jump. It's the same height as the bamboo you just called stupid. There's no way you can't jump the same height. Coward. You call yourself the legitimate heir of the Koga clan? Jump! Unsightly! Unsightly. More intensely. Ryuichi, what's the matter? TEN YEARS LATER You still can't grasp it- dislocating joints? I can dislocate my feet but not my hands. Idiot. Freeing you hands is more important than your feet. I don't like this, Grandpa. I'm tired of this. Ryuichi. I won't forgive regretful words. I don't like what I don't like. Why must I learn this? It is the duty and responsibility of the legitimate heir of the Koga clan. Secrets of Ninja taught to you by our ancestors isn't for outsiders. And you will transfer this knowledge down the line forever. Science is all-powerful today. Science is not all-powerful. It is a constantly revised hypothesis. So then, is Ninja useful? Ninja is not a hypothesis. It is the forging of superhuman intellect and indomitable spirit through years of discipline. No matter what, I don't like what I don't like. Grandpa, I'm leaving this house. I did it! Fighting me is absurd. For tomorrow, in addition to joint dislocation, we'll work on the technique I just showed you. Understood? To cling to the ceiling? It's Fog Hiding. It cannot be grasped with common discipline. Be ready for it. If I stay in a place like this, my youth will be wasted. Ryuichi. Where are you going? Answer me! To the toilet. Carrying baggage? Training gear. I was going to train alone. Your face doesn't look like you want to urinate or defecate. Is it not the face of one who lost pride as the head of the Koga clan? No. I was planning to train. Fine. Then I will spar with you. On guard, Ryuichi. Damn. Ryuichi. Trying to see with your eyes is futile. Concentrate on the new sounds. Clear your mind and fire becomes cold. Concentrate on new sounds and darkness becomes day. Takeshi Hayabusa. Formerly police narcotics squad section chief. Veteran narcotics and contraband investigator. Currently, a lone wolf assassin in the Yakuza underworld. Boss. Someone's looking. Who's there? Show your face. Who are you? I was hired by Five Dragons. An assassin? How much to kill me? Three million. I've become cheaper. Okay. I'll pay six. Kill the boss of Five Dragons. I only work with an advance. Hey. You're not just taking off with the money. "I always deliver" is my professional reputation. We got a deal. Leave. Yes. I still have Five Dragon business to take care of. I always deliver. I didn't see anything. So please. Don't kill me. I won't tell anyone. Take my body. And you gave the three million you got from me to the girl? I tend to answer sex with fairness. Maybe it was to keep her quiet, but it's too much money. But he made up for it with work before he died. What do you mean? Six million cash to kill you. Hey, hey. That's a lousy joke. I don't joke around. Well, that's money for nothing. You should keep it. Of course, I intend to. Well, job well done. Take it and leave. Yes. But my business is not done. What do you mean? A promise with the dead. Stop teasing. You look serious. Ichiro Sakura. Instructor at a Japanese Aikido Dojo. Lewd, with a violent personality. Expelled from his Dojo, he commits murder in his wanderings. Currently awaiting execution at Miyamori Prison. Wait a second. Taxi. With your ability, his escape is easy. Forget about it. The job's too dangerous for just a million in chump change. You think you're so important. You'd be bankrupt without customers like me. Hey. You dare to insult me? Even when I'm broke, I'm the proprietor of Koga Private Investigators. No management skills, a mountain of debt. Keep it up and you'll go to prison yourself. What did you say? You don't scare me. I've looked into it. No means no. It's now a matter of pride. See you. Okay. I'll respect your pride. I'll add another million. As long as I said no... No. MIYAMORI PRISON Hurry and change. Why are you helping me? I'm an odd guy. Look, don't forget this favor. We're going! Hey. Is spreading pepper some kind of charm? It hides the scent from the dogs. Is that so? You klutz! They're coming. Get that. Shoot. Listen. Put this in your mouth and dive. Got it? Everything okay? Everything seems normal. What? For some reason, my eyes sting. And I smell something too. What? Your senses are dull. What's that? What? That. That there. - Hey. - Sir! The patrolmen aren't here? Not here. What could they be doing? They haven't returned from their shift. I'm going to check the cells. Come on. Sir! Hey. Taro! Taro! Hey. We're going. They're going to catch on. This klutz is really hanging in there. Can't breathe. Shut up. Be quiet. Stay quiet! Hurry! Uncle, he's here. Good. Let him in. Hey. Come here. Yes. I'm always indebted to you for the bereaved families. What are you talking about? To the families of subordinates who died under your orders, the monthly money sent to them anonymously. I also know how you make that money. Commissioner, did you call me for an interrogation? No. Verification. Whether you're willing to reopen that case. Commissioner. Are you serious? It's as you suspected. I checked myself. So we have to have closure for the dead and their families. Commissioner, I want to. I've gathered your soldiers. They're both late. It's ten minutes past the appointment. Well? They should be useful. Yes. Uncle, it's Sakura. Hey. At least take your hat off. Why? Take it off! The sunglasses too. Koga already left the hotel first. He's already here. Hey, how long are you going to stay there in that stupid pose? Hey! I don't know who you are. You're just jealous and ridiculous. Why would anyone be jealous of you? I'm talking about him. What? Hey. Ninja skills mean nothing here. I'll make them mean something. You were clinging up there all this time? Can't you see, klutz? So what do you want us to do? Who needs to talk about this? If only you were a girl. What's this got to do with girls? To screw a girl that clings like an octopus. What would it be like? Uncle, let's start. Yes. In the last three years, our country has seen a rapid increase in drug addicts. We know the cause. No matter how diligently our government watches, we can't prevent drug smuggling by the Yakuza. She is the carrier. She is the daughter of a Latin American ambassador. Diplomatic immunity lets her go through customs without being searched. Moving in on her would cause an international incident. But if we get the goods, we have the upper hand. So I informally gathered a squad of six men. First, we led her to an abandoned area with fake street signs, to get irrefutable evidence. But... Hey. Well done. - Keep this a secret. - Understood. This is a diplomatic car. If you screw up, you'll be investigated. Let's see the diplomatic bag brought from Hong Kong. These aren't a bunch of hoodlums. It's good night for you. Commissioner, I will reconfirm the results of the meeting. One. The six police officers are to be unidentified. Until the case is resolved, the families will keep quiet. Two. Narcotics Section Chief Takeshi Hayabusa, who conducted an unauthorized investigation and got men killed, will resign. Normally, he would be summarily dismissed, but this is to keep it under wraps. That's it. Add one more thing. As Commissioner, this situation is from my lack of worthiness. I resign. - Commissioner! - No, you can't! Gentlemen, The rest is in your hands. The meeting is over. - Commissioner. - Commissioner. What a stupid tune. What? Hayabusa. He's right. But we have to keep singing this tune no matter what. Until we accomplish our mission. A former police commissioner that uses illegal means is no different from the Yakuza. As you say. But Yakuza still has duty and honor. It may be illegal, but we can save people who are on drugs. And the six unidentified cops and their families... Wait a second. That's got nothing to do with me. I won't risk my life for no money. Stop acting like a crook. If you're Japanese, you should have a sliver of honor. Hey, old man, when people act too cool, they only get hurt. Ouch. Damn. That was my once-in-a-lifetime mistake. Next time, it won't be so easy. You boast too much. Damn you! Ouch. It hurts. Hey, ninja, how about you? Show me the promised advance money. How much is that? The two million payment for the prison break. I only got 10,000. Advance me 1,990,000 right away. I can give it to you, but you can't use it in prison. Prison? What are you talking about? You won't get off easy for breaking out a death row inmate. At least five years for sure. You going to sue me? You're a disgrace to the police. Nothing to do with me. I was fired three years ago. Mr. Ninja, not looking too good. Right? Acting like I owe you because you saved my life. You were counting on a two million fee? You're not the type to cry over two million. If we get the narcotics from the Yakuza, it'll be money in the billions. You're going to keep it from the police? It's got nothing to do with the cops. Okay. I'm in. So what are you going to do with this annoying bulldog? Brother Sakura. Now is the time to make up your mind. If you live, you can date a girl like me. Do you want to know what my last boyfriend nicknamed me? Octopus. I'm in. Well, let's start working. Don't screw up. What are you looking at? Never mind. It's not you. Then it's me. What do you mean? Because you're always looking at me and fidgeting. Don't worry about your face. I don't care about the face. If we weren't here, I'd mess you up. Hey, it's no time to be arguing. She's here. The chick. Poor thing. She was born a deaf-mute. That's how the Yakuza is using her. That man is the New York Mafia's made man in Japan. Mario Mizuhara. Making deals using a woman. Yeah, all the time. Being with an ambassador's daughter is camouflage. Like when he went with the Triad's daughter, Chin Ruisho. It's so profitable, you'd faint. I think we should dance and stay close to her. For you, it's a great idea. Damn it. If we weren't here, I'd mess up that man of Koga. Damn. Stop grumbling. You and Emi stand out too much. Like a scene in a movie. Hey, brother, when you say that, I get itchy all over. The title is, The Beauty and the Erotic Beast. The drugs are in the bag. Okay. We're positive. It's dark. How could this... It's completely dark and I can't see anything... Power outage... Got a light? Where's the manager? What's the matter? Be careful. Isn't there anybody here? Turn the lights on! Klutz! Who puts on the lights? My fault. Sorry. Ouch! What's the matter? Brother, problems. The enemy is on to us. I'll take care of it. I beat him. That's impressive. You think so? Ouch! Don't touch me there. Hey! Where's the lights? Hey! Give me back that bag! That guy, he took off with it. Hey, hey! Don't let him get away! Impressive. You're of the Shaolin strain. Not strain, he's the original Shaolin thing. Gundara, Ubanisha school. Ninja wins! You don't play fair. Hey! We don't have time to play. Fool. Look at you sweat. Just a bit more, come on. That damn guy. Next time I see him, I'll kill him. Hey. Hayabusa. He's pretty angry. Hey! What was that last night? I don't know what you're talking about. Play dumb. Run me around. You mean the car? It doesn't run well. No excuses. Don't look sour. You tried to take off with it yourself. Hey, you. That's, uh... Give me my cut. That's not possible. What do you mean? The drugs were exchanged for cash, and the Commissioner took it. You're a ferocious thief. Hey, you think you pull off that kid stuff? Wait. Don't look so scary. You going to break my ribs? Like that guy yesterday? You saw that and made a fool of me. You better be confident in your skills. Ninja brother. My chest isn't soft like the guy from last night. We'll know right away how hard it is. All right. A contest. Come on! Damn. Hey, wait. Stop seething. You're dirty, setting a trap like this. The Koga House you grew up in is full of traps. But your fist from hell is impressive. If it was fair and square, you'd have pulled out five or six ribs. Damn. I thought it was hard. You had it fixed. Hey. Let's make up. Shut up, you cheat! What's with your expression? The next job isn't small like last night. It's genuinely going to be in the billions. Look, that mansion is Mario Mizuhara's hideout. The three conspicuous bodyguards have broken up. That means the drugs are no longer there. The New York bosses won't have them sitting around. Soon, they'll pull off a big job. Their safest carrier, that ambassador's daughter, won't be available. Her father is returning home. Uncle says it's the last chance they can use the blonde, so the Mafia will ship as much as they can gather. They'll gather ten years' worth. Going by my calculations, that'll be 20 billion. That's 20 billion. 20 billion. You can quit, if you want. Or you can take the job. Job? The blonde went to Hong Kong this morning. Before she brings the dope, we have to rub out their killers. That'll make things easier later. This is the list of killers. I'm in! Klutz. Hey, are you all right? Wow! Thank you. Don't hurt the pavement. NEW YORK They are a dreadful enemy. Most of our guys have been defeated. The hideout security is vulnerable. You came to New York to cry and complain? No. It's just that they are an enemy we've never encountered before. And what? What is your demand? The permission to use guns. Fists don't cut it. Shut up! The Japanese police are the best investigators in the world. If we use guns, they'll find our hideout for sure. Got it? If you don't have any confidence, just quit. I have prepared a gift for you. This is your gift. Leone of Sicily and... Lone Wolf, the fighting champion. Real beasts. Hey, brothers. I see your abilities. Let's call it a day. I still need more. Once I see blood, I can't stop. You there, what's so funny? Blazer Nishiyama. Killed five in the ring, and was banished. These two weaklings are no match. Knock it off. If you fight with Nishiyama, you guys will die. This telegram from the Commissioner says tomorrow afternoon at 1:00, the blonde has reservations on a plane to Japan. There's a drug shortage in Hong Kong because they gathered it all. After this job, I'm getting with a cutie, and I'm going to have lots of fun. If there's any girl that odd. What? Never mind. This may be more than 20 billion. Yeah. Look forward to it. Light. You got a big attitude. Hey, you're acting like the boss. You owe me, I don't owe you. Hey, hey, hey. Don't mess the carpet. You dirtied my pants. You klutz. It's hot. Hey, brother. Here's a handkerchief. Thanks a lot. You damn piece of... Knock it off! This is no time to be fighting. We can each earn 3 billion. Who's responsible for that? You bicker, but just 2 million alone is just small. Anybody brooding about 2 million isn't a man. DETOUR Hey. Yes. For you two. - Thank you - Sure. - Knock it off. - Ouch. You make me sick. Stop it. Let me at least hold your hand. Hey, you. Illegal obscene exhibition. Klutz. Out of the way. "Knock it off, you make me sick." We're too busy. Hey. You ever think about what a disgraced man would do? Sure, I understand. Just put away that obscene thing. Your fly. Looks awfully eager. Do your job like that too. Brother. Hey, looks awfully eager. Do your job like that. Hey, I haven't even heard the plan yet. What do you think you're doing? We blocked the on-ramp to the highway up ahead. They have to take this route. We'll force them into this abandoned area. This is where we do our job. Sakura, you concentrate on the dope. There's a truck hidden there. Take the dope and get out. Koga and I will massacre the enemy. Massacre? Why take risks if we have the dope? If the enemy loses the dope, they'll probably kill each other. They'll be desperate. Regardless, that's how it'll turn out. I don't like it. What if he takes off with it? He can't take it out of the country. It's too much for him to sell. If he doesn't show up on time... Uncle will immediately mobilize the police. You'll be arrested in half a day. Are you that stupid? Look at my eyes. I'll believe you. Those sincere eyes. Well, Emi, it's time for you to get out. We'll wait. By 10:00, no matter what. - Want to have a date? - Yes. Idiot. TOKYO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT They're here. Lone Wolf, the fighting champion. It's Blazer Nishiyama. Blazer Nishiyama? Your life's at risk. Go with gusto. The others are also Interpol blacklisted first-class killers. We need every hand we can get and our old man is in Hong Kong. You guys follow them. They're probably going to the hideout. If not, call Emi. If so, stay in the car where we were before. If you have to leave the car, put out a hazard flag, got it? Hey, bossy. Where are you going? A change in plans. I'll come back with some help. See you. So, your life's at risk too. Let's see if you get that date. Everyone. Ready. Please. Next. Please. Next. Please. OFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT Leave! I will not hear of it. No, please listen. To ward drugs off from Japan, I have resigned for the country, and am without a honorable job. And for the six unidentified deceased- Stop wasting your time. Never enter these gates again! - Elder. - Kurayama. It's been a while. I saw the training. You've improved a lot. As the successor to Nippon Shinren Kempokan, no one will be able to push you around. Congratulations. Elder. Give me time to at least change my clothes. I'll show you the results of diligence, in actual fighting. You overheard me talk to the Superintendent? It's excommunication. I can't ignore the Japanese drug problem and the six deceased souls. I see. Then I ask you. Yes. Hey, hey. Hey. What's this? Want to use your head? Hey. That Hayabusa, I don't trust him. If things go well, you think you'll get your cut? Let's split it together. Just thinking about it will make you "eager." I don't think so. This is so risky. That guy you don't trust is getting reinforcements. Do whatever you want, klutz. Is that crazy guy for real? First-class goods. Circumstances say we might not get any more for a while. The price will keep going up. 30 billion. I called you wholesalers because I don't want to split it up. Dispersion will be up to your discretion. But it has to be cash. Payment must be made by noon, in three days. All right? Well then. - We'll handle half... - No, a third... - No, the last time you... - That's not possible... What a waste. I wanted to smoke more. Last smoke? No one has ever put me down. This place has a lot of traps. You didn't have to do that. It's been a while since I had a worthy opponent. You'll have a better opponent coming down the line. Have a drink upstairs. We've gathered some women there. Women drug dealers don't interest me. How did that guy get in? There's a lot of them. Want to have a drink? Let me help you. No thanks. Everyone. Everyone. I will present you with an amusing show. The show I promised isn't this boring. From this point, this is the real entertainment. This guy challenged the Mafia. Just killing him would be too simple. Each person should kick and... strike him. The person that makes him fly the furthest gets 2 million yen. 3.5 meters. 6.12 meters. Okay, I'm next. I have to try a kick. Wait. Messing up a guy who's practically dead isn't my thing. Shut up. You're yellow. Unforgivable. I won't deal with a drunk like you. You got a problem with that? How do you like Japs? Nishiyama, that's enough. You bragged that you've never been brought down. Ryuichi, Ninja is not a hypothesis. It is the forging of superhuman intellect and indomitable spirit through years of discipline. "Blazer"...yeah, right. I'll knock you guys out. You were excellent. I wanted to duel with you. Give it back! Thief, give me back my laundry. I can't see. Elder. Should I drive? - Scared? - No. I'm all right, but... I still have car payments. Creditors won't come to the afterlife. That hurt. Damn. It already started. Hey, hey, hey, hey! Why are you leaving me? Elder. Who's their boss? Not here. I'll leave it to you. You wait! Elder! Please take care of... my car payments! Open it. You bad guy, you! Trying to keep it all to yourself is dirty, damn it. Hey, you. Just wait. You're a ninja, so it's easy. But I'm not. Man, you play dirty. Wait, damn it. Hey. You wait! Damn you. You're not keeping it for yourself. Ouch. Ouch. Ouch! Hey, their boss Mario took off. Wait! Hey, you! Hey, you look happy, but do you think they'll leave without the dope? You mean they switched it? If you don't trust me, I'll show you. Even an amateur can smell the difference between dope and flour. Damn. They're after us. Damn. It's that crazy guy and that cop. A crash victim suffers more damage. Hey. Speed it up. More. Faster! Can't you go faster? Rear-end him! Moron. I'm not gay. It hurts. Almost. Forget it. Watch out! Stay in, stay in, stay in. Don't move an inch. What are you waiting for? Get out the other side. - I can't. I'm trapped. - They're here. Whoa. Damn. Koga, don't hesitate. Get out. Seems like it went into something soft. You're alive. I found God. Even if you kill me, the Mafia continues. Shut up! New York Mafia, made man for Japan, Mario Mizuhara... lost to you guys. But... you don't get the dope. Hmm. What about the money you owe me? You only paid 10,000 yen so far. There will be other chances. Like that guy said, "The Mafia continues." You still want free work from me? Don't make that sour face. Here, brother. THE END Ripped by: SkyFury
