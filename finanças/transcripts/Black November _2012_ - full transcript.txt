What about Europe? Well, just get it done. - Driver, is this the fastest way to the airport? - - Yes, sir. Daddy, you're always so stressed when you head back to Nigeria. Yeah, well, nothing ever works, does it? I've been standing here for an hour, and I've seen nobody. But she's to be hung today. I mean, how do I know they're even in the United States? I think they're here. So, how did you and your men find a way into the US? How did you get visas? We found our way to Mexico. The rest is history. Okay, if "Ebiery" Perema is to be hung today, then why are you-- Ebiere Perema. Why are you not in Nigeria? Why are you not in Nigeria? Tamuno. Here they come. It's a very stressful place. Trying to straighten everything out there. Everybody's got their own agenda. Everybody's fillin' up their own pockets. Get out! Come on! Move, move! Get down! Let's go, let's go! Let's get out of here now, now. Let's go, let's go! Come on, come on. Hurry up. Hurry up! Stop wasting time. Get down. Down! Move it! No! Sir, sir. Hey, hey. I can see him across the street. Hey, you got a lot of people in there! Unit 304, code seven back on now. - You must document this. - You set me up! We are not bad people. We do not want to hurt anybody. How do you explain this? This is Cindy Charles reporting live with Channel 8 News. We're at the corner of 2nd and Figueroa, where we have what appears to be an extreme bomb threat. A group of terrorists have just taken innocent civilians hostage-- men, women and children here at the 2nd Street tunnel in downtown Los Angeles. We have a SWAT team on site as well as the LAPD. We have not yet determined their purpose or who they are. You gotta move it up. Whatever your reason, it doesn't justify this. This is the only language the West understands. That's crazy. This is for your people to know the truth! How are you getting out of this? Have you thought about that? That is our problem, not yours! You ask me why we're here. We are here to save Ebiere. Team Leader, we're in position. It's been several hours since the terrorists took the hostages. We still have no communication inside the tunnel. We have no idea who they are or what they want. It's Washington again, Barb. Workin' every angle, Bob. What can I tell you? Anything new? Nothing yet. Who the hell are these guys? Nothing on the wire. No contact yet. - Nothing. - Ma'am, the team is ready when you are. I'm not going in until I know what I'm dealing with. I got here as soon as I heard. What do you got? This was just posted on their Web site. They're called the United People's Front for the Emancipation... for the Niger Delta People of Nigeria. How in the world did they get in this country without us knowing? None of them were ever on any of our terrorists' list. We should have seen this coming. Here we go. - What do we know about these people? - That's the problem. Nothing. We need answers. - What are their demands? - They're live. My name is Tamuno Alaibe, and I am the leader of the United People's Front... for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta People of Nigeria. We have Tom Hudson, CEO of Western Oil. If Ebiere Perema hangs in Nigeria today, the guilty will go with her. Fifty percent of our oil comes to the United States. One out of every five Americans... uses Nigerian oil. We export crude oil to you people... only to import refined oil. Why? Because Western Oil and our corrupt government... wouldn't allow our refineries to work! The United States government does not negotiate with terrorists. All right, people. Listen up. I want everything on everyone in there. Now. How are they broadcasting this? Kristy Maine is inside. What? - There has to be a better way than this. - My people are dying! Our lands are devastated! Our farmlands, livestock, wildlife. Women and children, go! Not you. Sit down! She has nothing to do with this. You cannot blame me for your government. I am not blaming you for my government. I am blaming you for you. Maintain position near entrance. You will get on the phone and stop the execution. You are in bed with our government. No. I only represent my company in Nigeria. No! You represent most our government's income! They will listen to you! Well, you know your head of state, right? He answers to no one. He needs you and your money. Well, if anything happens to me, I'll just be replaced by another one and another one and another one. - You will try. - Let the hostages go. Maybe the US government will listen to you. - Maybe they'll do something. - It's too late for that. It's not too late. Ebiere is about to die, and the world knows nothing of her. I know of her. And what have you done? Do you want to tell your story? Do you want to tell the world? Ebiere Perema is a true daughter of the Niger Delta. Push now. Hey! It's a girl! ♪ ♪ Cheese! ♪ ♪ Where are my children? Look, listen. I want you to gather as many pails and buckets as you can. Yes, Mama! Because I hear the pipelines are leaking again. Go out behind the yellow bus. Okay, Mama! Hey! Happiness, where are you going to? There's another broken pipeline out there. I told you, I don't want you to go there. What do you want me to do? We need this oil to cook with. God, look at this. Look at this. Ah. Look at this. You are all under arrest. - What is our crime? - Stealing. - Stealing? - This oil is the property of the government of Nigeria. So what would you rather we do, stand by and watch the property of the federal government of Nigeria... spill and spoil our land? It is your duty to report any leakages in the pipeline. But we did last week, and no one came yet to do anything about it! I warn you not to continue. What would you do? Shoot me? Which is worse-- watch oil float past your house... and yet, in three days, you cannot get one gallon of what your federal government cannot make available? Huh? Continue! Take the oil! Take oil! Mama? Mama? Oh, my God! Ebiere's back! Ebiere! Ebiere! How are you? How are you? Where is Mama? She's at the pipelines. There has been another leakage. Tragedy struck today outside of Warri... in Nigeria's Niger Delta. A Western Oil pipeline transporting gasoline exploded, killing over 1,000 women and children... and leaving dozens more seriously injured. This is the fourth such explosion in under a decade, and accusations have already been made on both sides... as to who is responsible for the disaster. How would you expect the people to sit back... and watch gas and oil flow freely without getting some for themselves? The oil companies and federal government must pay for this! Many here are concerned that this may escalate tensions... between Niger Delta residents and the oil companies that operate here... in an oil-rich region already torn apart... by environmental disaster and human suffering. My Bubu die! They are being cheated. They are being marginalized. It is the fault of the people, and that was stealing. They deserve it. Only God knows how the fire came about. Oh, my God. I-It was great stuff. I mean, great stuff. But we need more. It's a gold mine. Get as many interviews as you can. Yeah, the camera right on it, on everything. There's never enough. Their pain, their feelings. Everything about this. We'll get it all. The real deal. More of it, more of it. It's so powerful. Oh, my God. We are outside of the town hall in Warri... in Nigeria's Delta state... to witness a meeting between members of the Niger Delta's oil interests... and its local communities. Nigeria is the fifth-largest producer of oil in the world. It is also home to a population of over 100 million people... living on less than four US dollars a day. My people have visitors in our midst. Our people say... the owl never flies by sunlight... unless it is pursued... by an aggrieved hunter. Are you getting this? In this case, who is the owl, or who is the aggrieved hunter? That is at your understanding... and discretion. We have come here not only to offer you condolence, but to offer you and your community... compensation for your irreplaceable loss. We are now at a situation which requires critical decisions. Do we compensate each family for their loss, or do we compensate the entire community? Let our money be given to us individually. Let it be given to the community! We can use it for infrastructure. No! Move in on her. Is there no man to speak for your family? I wish the fire had kept them alive. Besides, do men feel pain differently from women? This is not a matter for women. Then you will have to regard me as a man. Good show. Good show you put up here. Another wonderful way of pitting family against family. Or would I say man against man? You come here, enriching yourselves from the spoils of our land. In the process, wiping out families and generations. Yet you keep the fire burning. Give the people a rest, and they will rely on you. What they do is give us sickness and then treat us. They make us hungry, and then feed us. They kill our loved ones, and then offer us money for burials. Can you not see their plan? Yes. It is high time you start to think more of the people... other than your selfish, fat pockets... as well as that of your goons and cohorts. That's true. If you do not change your ways, the people will rise. Yeah! Yes! Excuse me. Excuse me. You're a new face in the debate over the Niger Delta. Are you here to ask the people to rise? I'm not a new face. I'm just one of the faces. I must mention, I'm one of the beneficiaries of Western Oil scholarships. As someone with the benefit of a Western education, have you come home to represent your people? No. I'm not trying to represent the people. Excuse me. I'm sorry. I didn't get a chance to introduce myself. My name is Kate Summers. I know who you are. Okay. I've been covering the Delta for almost three years now, and I have never met somebody who sees things as clearly as you have. I think your voice could make a real difference here. Do you think the men will let you speak? I'm not here to speak for the people. All I want is what is right for me and my people. Who is she? One of the beneficiaries of our scholarship program. Oh, well. No good deed ever goes unpunished, huh? It's good PR, sir. I couldn't care about that, okay? We have a corrupt military government breathing down our goddamn necks. The last thing we need is a body count next to our logo. - Take care of it. - Yes, sir. Gideon, these are your people, okay? Talk to me. What are we gonna do here? The villagers-- they're going to be a problem. They're asking for compensation. Individual payments on losses. But we can handle them through the elders. It didn't seem like that yesterday. They're in Abuja right now, and they want to meet. Okay. How much are we talking about? Well, um, if we-- May I suggest 500,000, sir? 500,000? Is that for the individual? Or for compensation for the entire community? Listen, I don't care if you give it to the elders, if you throw it up in the air. - Just make it go away. - Yes, sir. Gideon, find this girl Ebiere. You offer her anything. We need her on our side before this thing blows up and gets out of control. They are suggesting... $500,000. $500,000? $500,000! How do we get this money? We really need it. How much would you be prepared to give to the white man? He wants a cut. Let's give the white man $100,000. Okay. What about yourself? I suggest you keep $50,000. Uh, well, okay. Okay. You'll have to excuse me while I make arrangements for the money. God bless you. Thank you. Thank you. We are expecting $350,000! There are four of us here. I suggest we share $50,000 each-- Yes. And we use the rest for the hospital project. Yes! I really do appreciate this, but I must decline your offer. If I wanted a lucrative job, I would have stayed in the US. My desire to be here is for the people. This is Nigeria, Ebiere. Think like a Nigerian. Am I supposed to collect a bribe to be Nigerian? This is not a bribe. It is just the company's way of saying we appreciate... your efforts. What efforts? Efforts that couldn't keep my family alive. That was nobody's fault. So, have you come here to offer another bribe to the people? Uh, no, no. I didn't come here to debate with you guys. Then don't do it! Come on, man. What happened was nobody's fault. It is always our fault! Man-- Cool out, man. Wait, wait, wait. We love our freedom! We don't love greed! We love our freedom! We don't love greed! We love our freedom! We don't love greed! We love our freedom! We don't love greed! - Hosanna! - Yes? Hosanna! Yes! You are not, by any chance, preparing to go and join that lunacy? Is that what you call it? Lunacy? For once, our people are able to bond in a peaceful way, and you call it lunacy! - Yes! - All because the men are not involved! - Hosanna. - Yes? - You are not leaving this house. - And who will stop me? You and what army? Don't blame me for your inadequacies and weakness. - Eh? - Since the men have decided to take bribe... to enrich themselves, the women will take matters into their hands. Okay. Hosanna. Yes? If you leave, it is over. Eh! And don't expect to come back to this house. In case you forgot, my mother left me this house. It is my house. You may as well do me the favor of moving out before I get back. Hosanna. Useless man. And make sure you leave everything I bought. Which will include what you are wearing. Useless man. Hosanna. How did I get here? We love our free-- Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna! Hosanna! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Into your buses, into your buses, into your buses! Fast! Dede.

I want to make life unbearable for them. What if something happens to you? Suppose you get killed. Well, then at least I died for something I believe in, fighting for my land. Anyway, no one will miss me. Hosanna will miss you. Hmm. I will miss you. Join us this one time. - Now-- - See there? They can protest as much as they want. Protest? I want to fight. We are going to join the women. We can't let the women do this on their own. We will fight for our own land. What are we fighting for? Freedom! Get the weapons. Thank you. No. Thank you. Thank you. You do not need that. For protection. Just in case. Destroy our village. Rape our women. Destroy our families. They must pay. This is not the way. Where are you headed for? Abuja. - Why? - Why? I believe it is our business why we travel. Our intelligence reports... say a group of people are on their way to try to overthrow government. And those people are us, in 10 buses? To overthrow a military government? Wow. We will have to do a body search on everyone. You know, I'm surprised they sent you, Tamuno. You know him? Mm-hmm. He's my cousin. We were supposed to join the force together, but I suppose I wasn't good enough. Now they send him to stop us. They send our own to stop us. Can you not see what they do? I am only doing my job. I am a sworn officer of the Nigerian Police Force. My tribal locality is only secondary to my duty. What is your duty? Huh? What is your duty? Protecting the citizens of Nigeria. We are citizens of Nigeria too. - Uh-huh. - And law-abiding. Then you should have no protest to the search. You are a disgrace to your people. You're a disgrace! Please turn around and go back. My hands are tied, Dede. - You can't be found with any weapons. - No. I want you to arrest me. I want your government to achieve their aim. I want you to arrest me now! These men are here to monitor me. I am being set up. - Then leave the force now! - I cannot do that. My men are on orders to fire. Tamuno. What is this? What are you doing? My job. We are to conduct a search on everyone in all of the buses. - Tamuno! - - You are to come out with your hands in the air. - So you're going to do this. - I warned you. Now it's too late.

Do not fire! It is reported that on the 15th of January this year, you did give instruction to your men... to vandalize the facilities of Western Oil. I did not give any of such orders. Excuse me if I... do not understand you. But you invited them to come along with you to Abuja. I did ask for company. Ah! For what, if I may ask? A mass rally. Aha! A mass rally! Yes? It was meant to be a peaceful protest. - Hmm. - To the government. Mm-hmm. On the degradation of... our land and our people by the oil companies. Seventeen guns were found in the possession of your men. Were you aware that those men were carrying guns? I ask you again. Were you aware that those men were carrying guns? I only discovered when we were about to leave. - And you let them go with them? - I didn't think much of it. You and your men were planning not only to terrorize the oil companies, but also against the government! You were planning to overthrow the federal government! Ha! You are in serious trouble.

Within Warri judicial division, conspired with one another to commit murder, punishable by Section 319, subsection one of the criminal code, part 48, volume two, laws of the defunct Bandele state, 1976, as applicable in Delta states. Peter Gadibia, do you understand the charges read against you? I do, milord. How do you plead? Not guilty. He pleads not guilty, milord. Eloho Akwebasa, do you understand the charges read against you? I do, milord. How do you plead? Not guilty. She pleads not guilty, milord. Ebiere Perema, do you understand the charges read against you? I do, milord. How do you plead? Guilty. Order in this court. Do you understand the charges against you? Yes, milord. I plead guilty. I see where this is going, so I'd rather not waste my time, as well as that of the court. Milord, can this court graciously grant us recess... so as to enable the defense team to have a word with our client? - What are you doing? - They want us dead. They will hang us. Where's the patriot that fought so hard? If there's one thing I learned from reading about you, it's the never-say-die attitude. This is a kangaroo court, and the sitting judge has as much of a noose around his neck as I will. Yes, but there may be hope. You, of all people, should understand that. Understand what? Understand the fact that I'm about to be hanged with these people? No, I will not understand that. I think I'm pregnant, Kate. I think I might be carrying Dede's child. You must not tell anyone. Sweetheart, I'm so sorry. - There's nothing to be sorry about. - No, I-- I pushed you. I-- I saw such a leader in you. I didn't know it would end like this. Oh, sweetheart. I wanna tell you it's all gonna be okay. You be strong. They're ready to negotiate, but they need a scapegoat. They want you free. In return for what? You will have to indict some of your people. You want me to go in there and put the blame on someone else? Why not? Put the blame on the true perpetrators of the crime. But I didn't see whoever did it. But Peter, he had motive. He wanted revenge for his father. Yes. But I didn't see him do it. You need to decide what you saw and what you didn't see. If he had listened to you, this would not have happened. You need to go out there and say exactly that. Tell them the truth. Tell them how you warned them so the guilty are punished and you'll live. I swear to Almighty God-- I swear to Almighty God-- that the evidence I shall give in this case-- that the evidence I shall give in this case-- shall be the truth-- shall be the truth-- the whole truth-- the whole truth-- nothing but the truth-- nothing but the truth-- so help me God. so help me God. Miss Ebiere Perema, can you tell this court what happened on June 4? I killed some men. - Excuse me? - I poured petrol all over the car... and burned them to death. These people, they tried to stop me, but I wouldn't let them. I killed the men, and I did it alone. I killed them because... they caused the circumstance that led to the death... of my Dede. Come on. Come on. Turn around. Turn around. I hereby find you guilty of murder... on all counts. You shall be taken from here... to a place of execution. You shall hang by the neck until you are dead. May God have mercy... on your soul. ♪ ♪ ♪♪ ♪♪ - What is the sex of the baby? - It's a baby boy. A bouncing baby boy. You want to have a feel of your baby? No. No, I don't. Why?

The only way we're gonna get them to stand down is to put out the press release. I don't understand. We release a statement to the press that Ebiere has been freed. There's an American life at stake, a very important life. We'll do everything to keep him alive. - By my last count, there was more than one life involved. - You mean armed terrorists? - They're people. - They're people with AKs and explosives rigged to tankers. If we do this, it could result in a backlash of terrorist acts on America. Then what? Shouldn't we be focused on keeping Ebiere alive? - All we have to do is contact the Nigerian government-- - No. It is inappropriate for us to meddle in a judicial decision of a foreign government. The United States will not condone acts of terrorism on American soil. On your knees. On your knees! Hello? Ebiere is free! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey! They're coming out now.
