You're in a hospital Saint Jude's I'm Doctor Jeremy Newman I've been assigned your case You were admitted last night Don't you remember? That's okay Perfectly normal after that kind of trauma What happened? Paramedics were called just after midnight They found you, right in front of your house You had violent choleric abdominal convulsions I'm afraid we had to evacuate your stomach contents And? It's just, uh ... I apologize... I've never had to tell a patient this before We're a small hospital and painfully short-staffed I'm actually a pediatric doctor by training so any bad news I have to give usually involves a lollipop Would you like one? It's grape Doctor, please You died, Mr. Cable Your heart stopped beating for nearly two minutes No, no, it's alright We resuscitated you We brought you back You're good as new well, practically So, that's why I'm here Now, over the next few days, we'll ... run a series of tests to...

God, I've always been terrible with dates Well, that, that's okay don't worry about it Um, how about the month? What month do you think it is? It's uh, summer, maybe? How about the year? Well, last year was 1999 So, this year is 2000 It's the year 2000, right? Uh, your wife's name?

There's nothing to explain Dr. Newman His Synoptic Cholinesterase is practically non-existent I really don't wanna be discussing this right now What I need is coffee Poisonings have suspicious need you have to come report it to the police that's hospital policy Let's rule everything out first that's all I'm saying Diazepam, five milligrams Take it easy, Mr. Cable You're gonna be fine Just having a nightmare Let it go Mr. Cable Whatever it is you just have to let it go So what we're looking at here is Anterior grade amnesia Basically short term memory loss Nothing to get too worried about Nothing to get too worried about? These episodes usually sort themselves out in a couple of days a couple of weeks You're telling me that I've lost two years of my life? Think of it as if your life's a puzzle that's been jumbled up All the pieces are still there We just have to put them back together Fit them in the right order and place And, honestly, Simon I love a good puzzle And I have a wife? Yeah, these situations are tough on couples But your wife will help us with this She could be the key So, if you're feeling up to it I'll go and get her What do you think, Simon? Would you like me to get your wife? Simon? God! Simon I was so scared I called every hospital I didn't sleep at all Give me a break now The doctor says I'll be just fine Oh, my God What happened to you? You have no idea how scared I was For a moment I actually felt what it would be like if you weren't in my life I just completely lost it You know it was kind of pathetic What's the matter? Are you hurting? Dr. Newman hasn't told you what's happened to me, has he? Now you're freaking me out, Si I've lost my memory I can't remember anything about the past two years I don't even know how I got here last night And I don't know who you are What are you doing, Simon? Telling you the truth I'm sorry I don't know you, at all You're serious? With everything that's happened This is how you're going to tell me? Wait a second I don't think you understand - Are you crazy, Simon? - I don't know what happened I have nothing left Wait! Please! Anna! Anna! Whoa, Mr Cable Whoa, stop Stop her! - Stop who? - My wife! - There's no one here - What Are you talking about? No aerobics for at least a week, Simon Dr. Newman, will you please Stop My wife? Stop her? She's not going anywhere You have to tell her what's happened to me - I have, Simon - No, you haven't! Yes, he has Simon Thank God, you're okay The kids I work with can't get enough of these things I love watching their eyes light up when they finally put it all together It's just amazing Anyway, in order to recover what you've lost, Simon We need to find two points in time and join them So, let's begin with the last memory you can recall two years ago Can you tell us what happened last night? I wasn't with you last night He has no memory of any of it Your role, Anna will be to help him put his life back together Our life - It was our life - Of course Last night I was at home You were up here I don't know what happened Peter - I must have been visiting Peter - Peter? Peter is my brother He lives up here He moved into our parent's estate after my mom died We don't really get along, but.. That's the only reason I'd be up here, right? Simon, honey Peter's dead What? Peter died before we met There's no fucking way I was going to see him just last night You didn't see Peter last night He means his last night The last night he can remember There was rain and this light Then everything 's quiet No rain No light, just... Oh, gosh, he's talking about the car accident Just this empty void And I'm lost in it It happened right before we met, Simon I don't know that much Just that you were up here to see Peter I don't even know why You never used to like to talk about your brother There was a fight over their father's estate maybe you read about it Anyway after the accident This is the hospital you were taken to, I know that much Wait a minute I was here before? I really need a cigarette So, we have our two moments Simon Both were accidents both led you to St Jude's I can't remember It doesn't make sense None of this makes any fucking sense Two days ago you came up here to close up your parents' house It's been sitting here for two years, ever since... Anyway, you finally agreed to let it go You were going to pack up the furniture fix some of the fixtures finish the old staircase and Refinish? Interesting Not really, it's a gorgeous place but it's falling apart No, No, what I mean is well, one or two of Simon's enzyme counts are lower than normal But I thought you said I was okay I said practically, kid But your lower enzymes are an indication that somehow your bloodstream was poisoned Are you saying someone tried to poison him? I'm not trying to say anything But it's highly possible that your condition was caused by fumes from certain cleaning solutions or varnishes trapped in an enclosed space - So now what? - Well, you'll be fine We've got you an atropane We'll reactivate your cholinesterase with one of the doximes The sooner you can eat something, the better I've scheduled an MRI to make sure that everything is A okay So, if you'll excuse me I'm sure you've seen enough of me to last you a lifetime I'll check back in with you in a few... Anna? You can drop the pretense now you smug fuck My God, I knew you were a good liar but this performance is unbelievable! I don't know what the hell you're talking about Then I'd pay closer attention Don't think you're going to win this little game of yours because I'm a much better player than you are This is about her isn't it? Do you think I'm that blind? Is she really worth this? All of it? Who are you talking about? I'm talking about you A rich little daddy's boy in way over his head This would actually be sad if you weren't so pathetic Wait! You said Peter was dead Of course he's dead You killed him Knock knock, Mr. Cable it's time for your MRI What happened? Ask him sleep well, honey You... Hey! Come on, home boy I'm gonna take you on a little trip This isn't happening Man, I didn't think you could get any whiter but you look like you've seen a ghost You have to lie here So? What'd make someone wanna kill a nice all-American dude like you? What? Who said what? Relax, man It's just a rumor Everyone talks about everything around here Especially Nurse Clayton Arms down, please Nobody was trying to kill me It was just chemical I was using on the stairs Right, yeah Fumes must've got to you Keep your head still Anyway, my point is this everybody dies No mystery there But why and how everyone dies? That is a mystery we would solve Probably the biggest mystery there is Man, you're not making any sense I'm not the one who can't remember what year it is Okay - What's your name? - Travis Straps, too tight? Travis, are you going out of your way to make me nervous? Hell no, if I wanted to scare you I'd just tell you about the number of tumors these machines cause You hang tight now I don't wanna be around when this thing starts leaking I mean scanning Dr. Newman will be right along See you later Thanks, Travis Hey! You, in there Fuck Who is it? Doctor Newman? I know this sounds ridiculous but I've got this... terrible itch on my nose Who is there? Hey, I don't suppose you can unstrap me for... Hello? Hello? What are you doing? My name is Simon Cable You want to check the chart or something? I don't think I need that! Get off me Get the fuck off me! Somebody! Somebody help me! Somebody help me! Sweet Jesus What the hell just happened? What are you, some kind of a lunatic or something? Who's that? This is a hospital pal not a nuthouse! Oh, hey Doc! Glad you could make it We got a live one here - How did I just get here? - just get into bed, Mr Cable You shouldn't be up and about, not yet Who are you? Someone just tried to kill me - Yeah, Wacko! - Mr Travitt, enough Giving him some positive reinforcement, Doc This is Saint Jude's hospital Do you know why you're here? I was just in the MRl room I was strapped down mister... No, Mr. Cable, you were admitted into this room last night Now, do you know why you're here? I wasn't in this room last night I was alone... in a private room - No offense taken - Mr. Cable, look at me All I want you to do is to answer my one question Do you know why you are in the Saint Jude's Hospital? Yes, because of the staircase See, I just need to talk to my wife - Your wife? - just find Dr. Newman He'll know where she is We don't have a Dr. Newman on our staff, Mr. Cable Now, please look, if you don't calm down I'm ... What do you mean you don't have a Dr. Newman? - I was with him all last night! - Mr. Cable, please! The doctor who was here today A pediatrician I talked to him for about a half hour Mr. Cable, please Listen to me You have been unconscious since your car accident No, no, it wasn't an accident It was poisoning You must not have been on duty You've been involved in a serious road accident And the trauma has obviously affected your memory - A car accident? - Yeah And you're lucky to be alive, actually - last night? - Yeah That's impossible Swell going, Doc You calmed him right down What are you running away from, Mr. Cable? What were you hoping to find? Your mind's playing tricks on you Mr. Cable, that's all - There was No poison? - No, I'm sorry And there is no Dr. Newman on the staff at this hospital Look, you've been unconscious so the oxygen supply throughout your system - What's the date? - what? the date today? - July 29th, why? - And the year? - the year? - Yeah, What year is it? 2000! So you're telling me that it's the year 2000 and I've been in a car accident That I wasn't poisoned and there is no Doctor Newman Yeah, that's right What about my wife? - Your wife? - Yeah, My wife Actually, your admission papers have you down as being single, Mr. Cable Okay, I've just spent the entire day wandering this hospital talking to a Dr. Newman My wife, a mystery woman Orderly named Travis now, you want me to believe that none of this happened? You want a cup of coffee? I'm not crazy I can't be I don't doubt you believe what you believe, Mr. Cable The mind is a remarkable thing Perhaps your mind is showing you something you need to see So being poisoned and nearly murdered This is what I need to see? It's not for me to say I have been in this hospital before But two years from now This is not my mind playing tricks on me, this happened And this is where you met a Dr. Newman and an orderly named Travis? Yes, will meet You know, it's possible you could be suffering from a preoccupied delusion Mr. Cable - It wasn't a delusion - just consider While you were unconscious you fabricated a story then stored it deep within your memory banks so that now awake when you look back on it it appears as real as any true memory It was as real as these walls, or you Even when you're unconscious your senses are alive You have overheard things and then incorporated them into your delusion You said Travis, the patient in your room is Travitt you met a Dr. Newman I'm Truman It's like in a dream You think you heard a siren and then when you're wake you realize it's only your alarm Hey, wacko, you know what I've been thinking? I swear I know you from somewhere, I mean Were you anybody been in the papers or anything? What about Anna? Is she also just part of the dream? Yes, Mr. Cable, I would venture that she is I just want to remember I have to Sorry to interrupt, doctor I wanted to bring in one of my nursing students to check Mr. Hungout's vitals if that's okay That's fine, Nurse Clayton Go right ahead Okay, what the hell was she doing here? - It's just Nurse Clayton? - But she was in My dream Mine, too, hey what's she wearing in yours? How are you today? That's... but you said ... What? What is it? That's... she's my wife! Anna? Yes? Anna have you been here in the last 24 hours? No, is everything okay, Doctor? Mr. Cable, I need you to get into bed right now How could I know her name, huh? How could I? I know who you are I got it You're the son of that dead rich guy, aren't you? You're all in on this You're all out of your fuckin' minds! I know I was here! I was in this goddamned room! Anna! Tell him you know me! - A dactyl ten - Tell him you know me! Mr. Cable, just come and sit down, will ya? - It wasn't a dream! - I know - That was real, and this isn't - just relax This is bullshit! What are you doing? This is for your own good No! no, please - That's it - I'm telling you You're not real! Who's there? What do you want? What do you want? Get away from me! Doctor! Doctor, doctor, doctor! - Has to be on the door - You're gonna hurt yourself this is around that goddamn door! Keep your head still - Mr. Newton ... - Someone behind that door! - Nurse? Please! He's right there! - Five milligrams Diazefam - No, no! Simon, listen very carefully to what I'm saying You've been prescribed a drug that's known to have mild psychiatric side effects No one in the hospital who's gonna kill you There's no one behind the door Well if you're so sure then look Simon, please Look behind the fucking door! Okay I know Just look behind the door Not to see if there is someone there But to prove to me that there isn't someone there This will relax you C ward I'll join you there in a minute Don't leave! Don't you leave me! Simon, I have other patients who need me But they're not about to die! Neither are you And that's a promise Goddamn you people! Mr. Cable, please have some consideration for others Then get me off this thing The doctor's orders were quite clear Yeah, I know, I know but I'm claustrophobic One hand Yeah, well, it'll keep you quiet for a moment but just a moment Mr. Cable, I am not going to fight you What I will do is call security Mr. Cable, you're meant to stay here until you're ready to... What are you looking for? He was here I know he was It's 2002 Someone just tried to kill me I promise you, kid that is not true - Pralidoxime is known - You're not listening to me Someone tried to kill me before the nightmare just after that orderly left me strapped to that Goddamned machine You've got to believe me someone came into the room ... Take it easy, kid Try and relax take a breath Good, okay Now, I wanna show you something I think may help And that's me waking you up Keep your head still No masked intruders my friend It was so real I, I just... Under the influence of some psychoreactive drugs nightmares can be indistinguishable from reality It couldn't have been a nightmare You saw it for yourself, Simon You were all alone in that room I know I was here two years ago, after my accident See now that's good I told you to start remembering And the quicker that happens the quicker you accept what really happened The quicker you'll finally be able to move on Yeah, but still, I ... it wasn't as if I was remembering the past It was as if I was part of it I could interact with the people there I got it figured out then Maybe whoever it was that came after you was part of your memory too That's why he never showed up on the tape I'll just sit here and look pretty Was there ever a Doctor Truman here? Truman? That vaguely rings a bell Yes, 'cause I remember nurse Clayton and uh, and a patient named Travitt No shit? There's a Travitt on the fifth floor - what? - Yeah Heart transplant patient been waiting here about two years May I help you? I'm just uh ... looking up a friend But it's two o'clock in the morning What the fuck are you looking at? I'm so glad to see you Hey, got a cigarette? No, he hasn't How you doing, Doc? Mr. Cable, I think we should leave Mr. Travitt to sleep Oh, no Plenty of time to sleep when you unplug me from all this shit Don't you recognize me? Grim reaper? We were in this hospital together two years ago They come and they go Come on, Mr. Travitt please - Think back, 2 years - It doesn't matter Yes, it does! I was in this hospital two years ago I know I was And he was here with me! Holy shit, Wacko! Are you sure, Mr. Travitt? Abso-fucking-lutely,yeah this guy almost shouted the place down I see they won't let you escape from this place either It wasn't a delusion then I was here two years ago It was real This is good isn't it, doc? Isn't it? So you think you're feeling up to a few more questions? Simon Cable, born July 4th - My name? - Dr. Newman, Justin? Jeremy, close enough And the date? Is it tomorrow? Then it's the 30th of July, 2002 I'm impressed, kid Who's the President? Don't worry about it Let's get you back down to your room Is uh, Mr Travitt ever going to make it out of here? There's only one inescapable rule in the game of life, kid Sooner or later everybody has to stop playing Whoops, that's me I think it'd be better if you've got some sleep Thank you, Doctor I know I haven't been easy Of course we're not done with you yet We have a puzzle downstairs that still needs to be put together I think I just might be up for that now Okay Simon? Where have you been? I've been looking everywhere for you I know, I'm sorry I shouldn't have run off I just... It just seemed so cruel what you were saying You have to believe me I'm not making this up I'm not trying to hurt you I honestly don't remember who you are The doctor swears my memory will return, but it just might take some time I've got time I'll help you If I did something to hurt you... Claire My name is Claire Going down? Yeah Sorry Freight elevator's broken This never happens This never usually happens You're going back up I assume? Yeah, we must have missed our floor There's one thing I don't understand How, how can you and I - I thought I was.. - You're married Yeah I don't regret it, Simon Any of it It was you Anna knew No, she didn't that's impossible Yes, she did, something she said, she, she knew She was pissed I mean, really pissed You don't love her, Simon What we have is something really amazing Anna doesn't matter I know what we were and what you felt It's just waiting to be remembered Some things just don't get lost I don't know what to believe anymore I'll come back then - We'll just take this slow - Claire, wait! I love you, Claire Finally, he says it Yeah, but don't leave me out here all exposed I love you too, Simon I wish I didn't, but I do I think this is my favorite room in the whole house All these things growing I could live in here Back in a minute Simon, what we just said to each other It's serious I know I really don't need this drama, you know? I don't think we have a choice We always have a choice Simon I remember... What? The sunroom ... You... I remember loving you I told you Some things just don't get lost Sometimes... I can't help but think that we're paying for what happened What do you mean? I'll come back Think of me Clairee? Clairee? Clairee! How about a glass of water?

Of course I loved him Things change You know all this, Simon And us? Why?
