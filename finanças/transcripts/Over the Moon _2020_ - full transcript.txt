Scientists can tell us many things about space. They can tell us how far away the stars are. They can tell us that space starts 100 kilometers above the Earth. But they can't tell us about the space dog! He likes to chase comets and roll in the stardust! As far as the space dog's concerned, the moon is just a big, tempting ball. And almost every night, he takes a bite. And that's the real reason the moon has phases. So, when the moon is big and round, that's when the space dog doesn't take a bite? That's when the Moon Goddess Chang'e makes him spit it out. Blech! All right, does anyone want to hear the scientific explanation? Sorry, Ba Ba, I like the Mommy explanation best!

Hey, we got company tonight, so don't be late. Okay? I'll be back in time. Um... Ba Ba... Careful now! - Sorry. - Whoa! - See you next week, Fei Fei! - Okay, bye! Your scrumptious Mooncakes, fresh for tonight! We'll take four. Four? - Why not 16? - Whoa. Well, you fellas must get pretty hungry building the fastest train in the world! You know about the Maglev? I heard about it in school. It doesn't even bother with wheels. Floats on electromagnetic fields like a cushion of air. Whoosh! Magnetic levitation is the coolest! Huh. Did you know that's how it works? Mm-hmm. Mm-mm. Whoa. Ba Ba, I sold all of the Mooncakes to... Red dates? We never use dates. That's not one of Ma Ma's recipes. Well, I thought we'd try something new in honor of our guest. Fei Fei, this is Mrs. Zhong. Hi, Fei Fei. Hello. - It's nice to meet... - Oh. Oh, no. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. - I'm so sorry. - It's okay. I got it. I got it. Uh... Tour! Fei Fei, how about we give Mrs. Zhong a tour of the shop? That sounds nice. Uh... I'm sorry, I have some homework to do. Oh. Well, we could work on it together later. Uh, it's okay. All right. Can't believe I dropped that. I can't believe you did, either. - Thanks a lot! - I'm kidding! That's where we make the Mooncakes, and this is where we sell them. - Leapfrog! - What? - Come on. Leap over me. - No! What? Don't you know leapfrog? Here, watch Croak. You can't let a frog loose in here! Ah! Who exactly are you? You just met my mom. I'm Chin. I got fourth place, Yanshi City Ping-Pong Club tournament. Should've been third. Oh, oh, oh, and by the way, I have a super power. Can you guess what it is? Super annoying? I have two super powers! Look over there. What do you see? A wall? To you, it's a wall. To me, it's just something to run through. You can run through walls? Wanna see? Why, yes, I'd love to. No barriers! Ahhh! Did you see that? Almost a whole part of me went right through that wall! My molecules opened up. I could feel them separate. It's like the universe was calling me by name. Ba Ba, he ran into a wall! Eight-year-old boys have a lotta energy. Give him a pass this time. "This time"? His mother's very... nice. Yeah? I mean, you should talk to her. - Why? - Don't you ever get a little... well, lonely? No, never! Why? Do you? I have you. We have each other. Um... Of course, sweetheart, we're always gonna have each other. Nothing can ever change that. But, Fei Fei... there is something important I've been wanting to talk to you about. You know how since... Hello! Anybody order 12 big, hairy crabs? Move aside. Good-lookin' is gonna start cookin'. Hi, Aunties. Oh, Fei Fei, you've gotten so big! - Hi, Fei Fei! - It's so good to see you. Make way for the real cook in the family. Take a look! Oh, yeah, my favorite! - I'm hungry! - That sizzle! These dumplings, almost as good as mine. Mmm! That's smelling so good! - Fei Fei, take a bite of this. - Oh. - Thanks, Nai Nai! - Coming through! You're so skinny. Hasn't anybody been feeding you? The hairy crab is a burrowing crab, known for its furry claws. Hi, Ye Ye. Fei Fei, perhaps we can use my red dates for our second batch. Ma Ma preferred melon seeds in the paste. Oh. Well, my family uses dates grown in our garden. If you wanna try one, they're delicious. - I'm probably allergic to dates. - Oh. Besides, we only make them our special way here. Okay. Your right or my left? Seems like this table gets heavier every year, right? Ooh, hot plate! Careful. No rabbits at the table. You remember what Ma Ma said. Besides, that's my chair. The table looks beautiful. Um, where should I sit? Here, sit by me. - Oh, thank you. - Of course. All right. The hairy crab invades local waters, damaging fishing nets and native species. Ah, look how big and bright the moon is! You have a little bit of sauce on the side of your... It's gonna be huge for the Moon festival! Ma Ma's favorite holiday. Uh... So, your father tells me you're fond of Chang'e. Oh, poor lady, that goddess! So lonely up there on the moon. No one but Jade Rabbit to keep her company. Oh, come on! Chang'e loves it up there alone! That's why she took both immortality pills instead of saving one for Houyi! Actually, according to my mother, I might be related to Houyi. Houyi, the Archer! Cho! - Chin! - Ugh! That's not what happened, Auntie. Houyi was off fighting demons. With his bow and arrow and... - When a robber came and tried to st... - Steal the immortality pills? Yeah, yeah, yeah, she only put them both in her mouth as a hiding place. Not buying it. Chang'e floated to the sky while her one true love stayed here. And bit the dust. Now she lives with a rabbit instead of a husband. Good choice. But it wasn't her choice. She didn't try to leave Houyi behind. She misses Houyi and cries for him every day! And how do you know that? They text. - Don't tease Fei Fei. - It's just a silly myth. It's not a silly myth. It's real. Chang'e is real! - Ah... Fei Fei! - Uh-oh! She's on the moon right now, waiting for her one and only true love. Waiting... right, Ba Ba? Uh... Just give her a minute. She's at the top of her class, but she still believes in Chang'e? It's you and me, Bungee. We're the last true believers. Ow! Not really in the mood! Know what I am? A bat! Yeah, a dingbat! I hope you like dingbats because you're gonna see a whole lot more of me. Whoa! Not if I can help it. Haven't you heard? We're gonna be brother and sister! - What? - My mom and your dad are getting mar... Don't say it! Don't! Hi, Fei Fei. Hello. I didn't want you to miss dessert. Oh, um... I saved you a special Mooncake from my hometown... without dates. Uh... Thank you. No barriers! Ugh. Chin can be rambunctious at times. But after a while, you get used to him. Zhong! Get over here before I kick everyone's butt at Mahjong. Oh, yes. We'll see. "Get used to him"? I'll never get used to him! What's so special about your Mooncake? I don't want it, and I don't want you! I just want things back the way they were. He used to believe in Chang'e. He said she was absolutely real. But now he's changed. If Ba Ba could only believe again, he would never marry that woman. He would remember everything. He would remember you. Bungee!

Huh. What butcher cut your hair? I did. Hmm. You have a round face, you need length. And you have a rogue eyebrow right... - there. - Ow. - Improved. - So much better! All right, Unfortunate Hair Girl, consider yourself welcomed. You may now give me the gift. Um, I'm sorry, but I didn't bring you a gift. Of course you brought me the gift. Why else would I have sent my lions to bring you here from Earth? Those were yours? They're so cool, and you sent them for me. Well, of course. You were given the one thing I need to bring Houyi back. Houyi? I knew you've never given up on him. That's what I was telling my dad! You see, I'm in an urgent situation. I came a long way. I built a rocket... She's talking, but it's not about the gift. No, Goddess. What I mean is, you're the one who believes that love never dies. Everybody knows that about you. My dad used to believe that, too, but now I'm afraid he's giving up. If I could just have a photo to prove to my dad that you're real... Pictures! She wants pictures. Everybody wants pictures. Does this look like a photo op to you? Um, yes? Then do it fast. Uh-uh. No gift, no photo. But I don't know what it is. You can have anything of mine you want... I don't want "anything." I want the gift! Chin! Clearly, you've lost my gift. I sense it's on my moon somewhere, and I suggest you go find it! Let's stop playing games. There's only a sliver of moon left. When the last moon dust falls, it will be too late to bring Houyi back. Lunarians, I announce a competition. Anyone who finds and brings me the gift will get their wish granted. If you bring it to me first, you'll get your photo. Good luck and Godspeed! Find it! - Come on! - Out of the way! She'll get me that gift. And, Jade, your potion is the final piece we need to bring Houyi back. And you will be ready, won't you? Let me through, please! Hey, can I get a... ride? The gift... It has to be at the crash site! What could it be? Wait up! We'll help you find it. - I don't want your help. - First, we find the gift, then... I said I don't want your help. - But I just wanted... - I never wanted you on this trip! I never even wanted you in my life!! You can't talk to your brother like that. You're not my brother. But I could become your brother. You will never be my brother! Bungee! I don't have time for this. Will anybody help me? Argh! Whoa! Whoa... Could I get a ride? Biker chicks only. Wait! I know where the gift is. Well, all right. Follow the leader! Okay. I'd be a great brother. Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! I just have to get that photo! Come on, Bungee. Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! You take that one, and I'll take the rest. Easy peasy. Whoa, whoa... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Whoa! What are these things? Ow! Palace Security. - Hut! Hut! Hut! - Whoa. What are you doing here? I want the photo for my sister! Well, I want the gift. Well, I know where it is. Oh, you do? Bring him to the interrogation chamber. Uh, is she taking me in there? Because I won't go. I won't, I won't! I'm in! Whoo! How about a game? Do you like games? You know it. Tell you what. If you win, I'll give you this photo. But if I win, you tell me where the gift is.

Well, at least the potion is working. I'll never see Houyi again, will I? Looks like the Moon Goddess is astronomically upset. When she's mad, this road's a suicide mission. Yeah, let's wait it out. No! We're going! Follow me! Go left! Whoa! Right! Okay, now left! We've gotta get through that canyon! Whoa! We're not gonna make it! Don't be such a chicken. Let's get that gift. No barriers! Ahhh!

What's your name? - Uh, I'm Fei Fei. - I'm Gobi. What's your name? I feel like we're talking in a circle. I actually used to be a nervous talker. I think that's what's great about me is that I'm so self-aware about my nervous talking. So I gotta slow it down, relax, and just breathe. Checking my pulse right now. Ah, serenity achieved. Who are you? What are you? I happen to be Chang'e's most trusted advisor. Very high level member of the court. I mean, not like a court jester, but definitely a member of the court, like, really high up. I'm basically indispensable. Then what are you doing all the way out here? - Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey! - Wait. Is that the lunar rover? With my parachute? I don't know. Oh, you can take my cape, but I'm keeping these sweet moon pants. Dig it! - What's he doing here? - What? I wouldn't be talking to that one if I were you. Yeah, he was kicked out of the palace by the Goddess. - Hey, easy! - Don't listen to them. These Lunarian chickens, they got a little scrambled up, it's... it's fine. It is not fine. They are bad eggs. Uh-uh! Look who's talking! - Yeah, you little green glow worm! - Ow. Hey! Quit wasting time. We have to find the gift for Chang'e. Chang'e! Oh, I wanna help. Can I help? I'd love to help. Did I mention I can help? - Oh! - No, no, no, no, no, no. Who do I look like? Who do I look like? ♪ Whoa-oh-oh-oh Egg-straordinaria! ♪ Argh! My Chang'e doll. Oh, yeah, she's amazing. I can't help but break into song when I see her. A gift my Ma Ma gave me. This must be it! Yeah, must be. - Thank you! - Hey, wait! - Sorry, newbie. - Whoa, whoa! - I'm sorry! - Give it back! Hey! Watch it! That's enough out of you. Ew. No! That's mine! Come back! Whoever gets it to the Goddess first gets their wish granted! You can't leave me here! I'm gonna get that gift. - And bring it to Lunaria! - Lunaria? But you'll need a guide! And guess what? This guy used to both work and live in the palace. As soon as I get that gift back, I'm taking it to Chang'e. Oh, oh, oh, please let me help you bring a gift to the Goddess! - No. - Please? - No. - Please? - No. - Plea... - No! - Let me finish. Okay, okay! Just stop making that noise. Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Hut! Ow. But my whole point is I'm a nervous talker, and I'm starting to work on that. I realized, "Wow. Am I talking fast?" I thought, "You should relax." So I've been working on slowing it down and breathing and... Uh-oh. Sometimes it causes me to get a little tongue-tied. I hate it when this happens. Gobi, what's happening? Please tell me they're not hungry. They're not hungry. I'm lying. They're very hungry! I've never seen them this ravenous! Whoa! Run away! They're going to Lunaria Lake to feed. Hey, I know this game! Sorry about this. Whew! We should catch up to those biker chicks in no time. Whoo! That was a bonding experience. Do you feel close? 'Cause I feel closer to you. I feel like this is amazing. Besties forever. ♪ Uh, forever! Uh, forever! ♪ Uh-uh-uh-uh, chicka-chicka... Huh? Good times, good times. So, why are you living by yourself? That's a personal question. But since you and I are like family now, I can tell you. It happened a long time ago. The Goddess exiled me from Lunaria because of a song I sang to her. She exiled you over a song? She's nothing like Ma Ma said she'd be. Ma Ma said she was kind and gentle, graceful as a swan landing on a quiet lake. She was all those things, until Houyi died. And then she just pushed us all away. Once you lose the person you love the most... It changes you. Yeah. After I sang that song, the Goddess disappeared. All the lights in Lunaria just went out. We call it "The Big Darkness." That song, will you sing it for me? Uh, I don't know. The acoustics aren't good when you're singing on top of a frog. Please?

Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa! Aw. Hey, little guys. Where is it? Argh. Are you nuts? It's mine! Give it back! Get your grubby mitts off it! No! Guess there's no gift now. Fei Fei? You can come out, they're gone now. Come out, Fei Fei. I'll do anything to make you okay, anything! What do I have to do? Look up. Oh, no! I've lost everything now. Not everything. You still have this, and this, and... this! And you're alive. That's a plus. That gift was my only chance to stop my father from getting remarried. "Remarried"? Your mother is... I mean, is she... gone? Now I'm stuck here. The gift is gone, and my dad will marry that awful woman with her horrible boy! What horrible boy? A ridiculously annoying boy. Nobody likes annoying creatures. They are the worst! - He's always making faces. - Ugh! He plays leapfrog all the time. He thinks he can hang upside down like a bat and run through walls. - And he's always interrupting me! - Let me finish. He plays leapfrog? Is that where you got the idea for us to ride on those frogs? No! I mean, not really. And he hangs upside down like a bat, like you did when you almost got scorched? Is that where you got that idea? No! Anyway, I can't stand him. I can't stand him either. - Did you say he can run through walls? - Forget it, all right? I would love to have a brother. You know, but then again, I've been alone for a thousand years. How many years have you been alone? Four. Well, give it time. You might change your mind. I think Ms. Grumpy-Pants is hungry. Hmm? Why don't we eat something? Everything looks better when your tummy's full. Ooh, there's a tasty map right here. Mmm! Delicious. Have some map. - Mmm. - Blech! I can't believe you eat Mooncakes. That's barbaric. These Mooncakes don't have feelings. Ow! What's this? Looks like the broken half of something. Chin probably found it somewhere and thought it would be funny to bake it into a Mooncake. I told you he was annoying. Wait a minute. Why does this look familiar? Nope, never seen it. This half forms a whole with that symbol. This amulet, Gobi! It's the gift! There's still a chance. We've gotta get this to Chang'e! - Come on! - Aah! We need to help Fei Fei. No barriers! Ahhh! I did it! Bungee? Maybe we did it. If she's coming with the gift, it has to be now. Got ya! Chin? Fei Fei! Oh, my gosh, I'm so happy to see you! - You're okay! - It was so crazy! The poles were all moving, and then I was surrounded... Look. We got the gift. Wow! Hi, I'm Gobi. Rad. I'm Chin. Double rad, I just returned from a thousand years in exile. I wonder if I'll run into anyone I know... Gobi! The amulet! Fei Fei, get it! No, no. Leave me be. We're almost out of time! - Oh, thank you. - Hurry, come this way. Goddess, it's here! Fei Fei. I think this is the gift you're looking for. Of course, the other half of the amulet. Our two halves can make us whole again.

It's impenetrable. Only the Goddess has ever gone in there. Let me try. I told you, you can't go in... - How did you do that? - No, no! If you go in there, you may never come out again. You may never go home again. Fei Fei! Chang'e? It's me... Fei Fei? Bad Haircut Girl. I'm here to bring you back. Mom? - Fei Fei. - Ma Ma! Over here! Fei Fei! This way! I was afraid of this. She's stuck now. No! Bungee! Fei Fei! What are you doing here? You don't belong here. But I do belong here. You can't stay here. You'll only end up lonely for all eternity, like me.

Thank you for bringing me the gift, Fei Fei. I wish it had given you everything you wanted. It did. The real gift was you. Bye, Fei Fei! Besties forever! Forever! Forever! Bye-bye! Forever! Chicka-chicka! Forever! Chicka-chicka! Forever! I'm starving. ...way too many cooks in here. Hi, Fei Fei. Out of the way, Space Dog! Eating hairy crabs has been called a life-changing experience. It smells so good! Really? - Zhong Ayi, can I help you with that? - Oh, of course. You know, the Moon festival is my favorite night of the year. My Nai Nai always told me the circle of a Mooncake is the symbol of a family coming together. Hmm? - Fei Fei, sit here. - Come, sit by us. - Chin. - Chin! Get that frog off the chair. Sorry. Be careful. If he does that again, he may end up as your sister's next science experiment. Don't tell him that. It's the Moon festival, and no moon! Chang'e must be so sad, hidden behind those clouds, dreaming of her one true love. Come on, don't start that again! Start what? It's romantic. No playing with your food at the table. Are you gonna eat that? Not now, we're talking about Chang'e! Looks like the moon has decided to come out for us after all. What do you think Jade Rabbit's making tonight? Moonmush! You laugh just like your Ma Ma. I know, Ba Ba. Should we head back? I'll be right there. - Ha-ha-ha! - All right, you dingbat! Mom! Fei Fei's chasing me! No, I'm not! Chin!
