DEEWANA Kashiram! - Yes Madam! Have you packed Prince's bags? Did you pack his warm clothes too? It must be cold there. Don't worry! I've packed everything! Check the things carefully! Alright, Madam! It's time for the Tilak and Ravi hasn't come yet! Munshi! Call the station master and instruct him to hold the train. He's so indisciplined! You cheat! You pretend to love me as you're leaving now! Please apply vermilion on his forehead! His face bears a special radiance! That's the reason he's popular! I'm late, shall we go? - You must... Take care of yourself on reaching there. I don't trust you. Out of sight, out of mind! The whole house wears a deserted look in your absence. In that case I won't go. I'll cancel the show! lf you care for your mother, get married soon! Brides aren't available in the market, Mom! She is a doll as far as this house is concerned! When will you bring her? - During this trip, perhaps. In a wink! - I hope so! But you must promise me not to faint after seeing her. I promise...to faint! You take care of yourself too. - Bye! Uncle has come too! Where are you heading to? To Sundernagar! Bless me, Uncle! God bless you! - Bless me, aunty! I've got to perform at a concert there. I take your leave now. Bless me, sister-in-law! - Bye, son! Narendra! - Yes. Get those files! - Sure! Sister, Ravi is the crown prince! He has to manage this huge Empire, right? But he seems to neglect everything! Music doesn't suit our family, sister-in-law! Ravi is immature yet! He will understand everything gradually. Moreover, music is only his hobby. But our honour is at stake! Calm down, brother! You've got to sign a few documents! I see! - These documents pertain to the Jungle! These are details of the material we've supplied! And these are the new tenders that have been passed recently. I trust you. Where do I have to sign? Please read them atleast once. - You must read them, aunty. Else, Papa may transfer all the property to his name. It will only prove beneficial, even if I do so. Sign here! - I look forward to Ravi's marriage! I'll go on a pilgrimage once Ravi settles down in life. Then see, how he realizes his responsibilities automatically. Wealth is fascinating indeed! One is never content! He craves for more and more! You've involved me too in this sinful deed! If Queen Mother learns of the truth, we'll be doomed! You know that I fear death, don't you? Don't worry, Chintamani! Anxiety is as good as a pyre! But I'm making arrangements for... that old woman and her son's funeral pyre. As it is all the properties are being transferred... to my son's name, gradually. Once the formalities are completed... Mother and son will be finished! I am only her step brother-in-law after all! You don't know how one feels when one is a step-brother. I've tolerated all the injustice! I shall avenge every insult! I shall ruin the entire family! And after that, I'll not be what I'm today... I'll be " Sir Dhirendra Pratap". He was the Queen's faithful servant! He died an unnatural death! I think jovial people like you reside in Sundernagar! Thanks for the compliment! But only an artiste can recognize another artiste! Are you an artiste too? - Yes! I'm Devdas, the all rounder! I write lyrics and compose music for them and sing as well. Hear me folks You have a sweet voice indeed! Shall I sing a song for you? What have you done? Be careful! You were playing so beautifully, I was a bit carried away. Sorry... You're great! If the car had been slightly on this side... So what? The show would've still continued, but of a different type! Come on now; let's go to the guest house. Strange indeed! I've unloaded your luggage! I think I must beware of you! How long will you beware of me, Sir? I've transformed my wife from Paro to Chandramukhi! Are you a magician as well? Maidens living here tend to cast a magical spell on people around! Are you married? - No! - You can't escape their clutches then. What do you mean? - Don't meddle with these things... You mind only your business. You'd better not venture out! lf you move out, a pretty maiden will cast a magical spell on you. Are you explaining to me or scaring me? Are you trying to understand or are you scared? Amitabh Bachchan too said the same thing! I'll come to fetch you at 7:00, sharp! You may relax, I take your leave now! I'll come at 7:00! Seven friends standing in a row Demanding tickets I told you that tickets aren't available! Kajal! You won't gain anything by jingling these anklets! People are quarreling for tickets as though there's an election! May you be cursed! Why do you say so? She's your only niece, right? - I'm her only uncle, right? What's the connection between the 2? - They're connected. You claim to be an influential man, can't you arrange for a few tickets for her sake? Aren't you ashamed? - Why should I be ashamed? Do I have to arrange for tickets to prove my identity? I said that tickets aren't available and I mean it! I can't arrange for the tickets even at the cost of my life. I'll kill you! Hey devil! Have you taken it seriously? Calm down! I shall try my best! I shall arrange for the tickets at the cost of my job! Oh uncle! I won't hesitate even to resign for the sake of your love! I shall form a Drama company instead! But promise me, you will work for me, won't you? Promise me! - I suspect foul play! My name is Chandramukhi, after all! And you're the cause of my miseries as well! *I'm in a dilemma... *whether to accept you or not *Should my heart throb *for your sake? *You're the girl of my dreams *and sweet memories *l shall certainly find you *I'm in a dilemma... *whether to accept you or not *You're a fragrant flower *You're a poet's delight *You bear an innocent face *You resemble the moon *You are worthy of praise *Your looks are bewitching *You're the epitome of beauty *I'm in a dilemma... *whether to accept you or not *The day I catch sight of you *l wonder what it will lead to *l shall hold you in my eyes *And in my arms as well *l shall make you *the queen of my heart *My heart craves for you *I'm in a dilemma... *whether to accept you or not *You're the girl of my dreams *and sweet memories *l shall certainly find you *I'm in a dilemma... *whether to accept you or not Please make way! Please excuse me! What should we do, Kajal? Don't worry! I'll do wonders! I'll kill him! Oh God! I'm dead! Stop! Who are you? What have you come here for? Speak up, else...watchman! - I'll kill you. Will you kill me? - Why did you threaten me then? What have you come here for then? It's a good way to get an autograph! l attended your show as well, but people surrounded you, so... What's your name? Kajal.. Is it the kohl women apply in their eyes... or the one that's used to cast the evil spell away? Both! - Both!? What should I write? - Anything nice! Happy? When you come the next time... What happened? My leg is sprained. Sprain? - It's paining me! How will I get back home? - Home!? I'll take you home! Come on! Take care! Take care! Where do you live? There! - Where? - Near the hillock, next to the big tree. Below Choturam's house and next to Moturam's bungalow! My maternal uncle, Devdas' home is situated there. So, you're Devdas' niece, right? Everyone in Sundernagar is like that, right? Like what? - Foolish! Shut up! - Guide me to your home! I'll get a heart attack. He was so close! Now he's gone so far. - How lucky she is! *One need not look *into the mirror *It reflects one's age Uncle! - What's the matter? What's wrong with my child? - What happened, Kajal? Will you have mercy on me too? Guide me to her room so that I can lighten this burden! I'll kill you. - Don't threaten me! Show me! - What should I show? Her room. - Follow me! Please come! Please put her on this bed. Please put her on this bed! Will you tell me what the matter is? I went on a stroll to the hill-top and slipped... I hope you aren't hurt! - I am hurt! You've done what Vibhishan did to Sudama. Not Vibhishan, Sudama! That's what I meant! - You chat while I serve tea. Hurry up! It's your picture! Kajal is your ardent fan! She sings songs composed by you! You must take good care of yourself for a few days! I'll take care of my reflection. It's very difficult, dear! It costs a fortune! - Is anything left? What's wrong with me? My neighbour answers me... when I question my wife. And now that I ask Kajal, you're answering me instead! Was that a joke? - No! Please have tea. - Did you prepare only one cup? You may... - You have it, it's special. How long do you intend to stay here? My mother says that witches reside in hilly areas. Hence, I plan to leave tomorrow. - Not possible. You may come whenever you please, but you can't leave as you please. Right? - Right! - Absolutely! Only an artiste can recognize another artiste, right? Am I right? Remember, whenever you look at yourself in the mirror,... someone else too is looking at you. `You're my desire!' `l wish to hear my name from your lips!' `l wish to breathe through your fragrant hair' `And I wish to see my picture in your kohl filled eyes' `I've gathered the courage to write to you now. Yours, Ravi' `My dear Kajal, you're the light of my eyes' `You're the fragrance of the night... and the brightness of the eve' When will you see me? When shall we meet? When will you address me? I've booked Ravi's ticket thrice and cancelled them too... Ravi doesn't seem to intend leaving the place. l must say, this place is mesmerizing. I too was trapped by you in a similar manner, right? May you be doomed! - Where are you heading to, Bahadur? Sir! - What's all this? A love letter! - For whom? - For Madam! What nonsense is this? A fragrant love letter!? What are you upto, Chandramukhi? Are you bent on tarnishing my image? What nonsense are you talking? Are you out of your senses? My reward! - You want a reward, don't you? Take this. I'm doomed! My image has been tarnished! I'm doomed! - What are you blabbering? Why don't you read the letter first? Who will write to me? You're right! Hold this! Who will write a letter to you? It's time for you to get a telegram. Am I right? What are you laughing for? Whose letter is it? You won't understand! I'll explain to you. Where are you, my dear? My dear child! Do you love Ravi? Is this true? What's the truth? Who's opened a flower shop here? - Is it true? Answer me! Hey! - Why don't you answer me? I'll answer you, dear! Ravi loves Kajal! Kajal too loves him! But this isn't a suitable pair. They're rich while we're poor. I don't approve of it! - You're so narrow minded. Only one artiste can identify another artiste! Am I right? - Yes. I'll kill you. - I'm dead! Listen! `My songs are incomplete and so is my breath' `My life is meaningless' `l long to see you' `Please have mercy on me' My love! Stop! My eyes are filled with tears of joy. They're drops of nectar and not tears! They're glittering like the dew! You're the apple of my eye. *I expect you and wait for you *I expect you and wait for you *Oh beloved, I only love you *Oh beloved I too sacrifice my life for you *oh beloved, I only love you *Now dreams do not come to the eyes *Now you are settled in my eyelids *You stay with me every moment *You have made a house in the heart's world *l trust your every word *oh beloved, I only love you *You are the same for whom I was searching *You are the breath's fragrance, you are the heart's thirst *I am your love, I am mad about you *I am a stranger to the rest of the world *Dear, I love you a lot *Oh beloved, I only love you *I expect you and wait for you *Oh beloved I too sacrifice my life for you *Oh beloved, I only love you What did you ask for, Ravi? You tell me first. - You say it first. You must say it first. I... asked... Love knows no religion. Nor does it crave for words. I know what you asked for. You're my present and my future as well. I'll follow your footsteps blindly. Your destination will be mine as well. I grant my love to you today. Sonu! - Say it again! You must address me by that name always! lf you address me as Kajal, I'll think that you've disowned me. Where had you been for so long? I was at home as my leg got sprained. Was your leg sprained or your heart? - I'm saying the truth. But your eyes reflect a different story. - What!? You're in love It's not fair on your part to have forgotten us! Whom are you talking about? - Your guest will preside... our Annual Function. And Kajal will dance in his presence! That's right. - I won't dance in his presence. And why should he be the Chief guest? Won't he heed to his dear sisters-in-law? Won't our brother-in-law heed to us? Where were you? - I was waiting for you. Why didn't we meet earlier? - You never thought of me so. My eyes reflect your love. And your face. - That's a lie. How can I reside in your eyes? - Don't you believe me? Look into my eyes then! - Oh God! You're right! I do reside in your eyes. What sort of a magic is this? lnitially, I too was surprised,... but I realized it the moment I got close to you. ln that case, we'll remain close to each other, forever. Close, right!? What are you up to? Stop! Where are you heading to? I won't spare you! I'm trapped! - What's the matter? They're approaching us. - Who? My friends are approaching us. Please don't heed to them. Please refuse to heed to them. She's gone! Our Annual function is scheduled for today... and fortunately, you're here, so we wish... that you grace the occasion. We'll be honoured! - Actually... You know, Kajal will dance tonight.. Kajal will dance tonight? - Yes!! She is very good dancer. Didn't she mention this to you? - No! Haven't you understood yet? - How could l? She dances to your tunes, doesn't she? Your darling is about to arrive. Am I right? How will I dance without my spectacles? I can't see him either! `One doctor and a hundred patients!' We've been eagerly awaiting your arrival. You shouldn't have entered through the back door. l wanted to meet you all, first. I wanted to surprise you all. I heard that you're a good dancer. But I thought you made others dance to your tunes. Then I consoled myself saying that one who makes others dance... will create a sensation by dancing herself. Won't you say something? A restless soul can rest in peace, only when... When you cast a magical spell by your dance! Look, your anklet understands my language. But you fail to understand! *Oh these anklets! *Beloved, you're my life *I want to go with you *Beloved, you're my life *Take my hand in your hands *Beloved, you're my life *I want to go with you *Beloved, you're my life *Take my hand in your hands *Oh these anklets *Your anklets make some noise, steal my sleep, make me lose my senses *They call me near you, oh my god *Oh your anklets *My anklets sing songs with tunes, awaken love *They call for you to come near me, oh my god *Oh your anklets *Your dreams are in my eyes, talks on my lips *My days do pass but my nights don't pass *Your dreams are in my eyes, talks on my lips *My days do pass but my nights don't pass *How can I tell you about my heart's condition *I don't even know what month, day or year it is *The bond of breaths will connect our breaths *Hey fair one, your anklets are my heartbeats *Oh your anklets *My anklets sing songs with tunes, awaken love *They call for you to come near me, oh my god *Your anklets make some noise, steal my sleep *make me lose my senses *They call me near you, oh my god *O crazy one, your name is written on my anklets *Now my morning and evening pass in your arms *O crazy one, your name is written on my anklets *Now my morning and evening pass in your arms *	My heart wants to become your anklets *I want to steal the colour of your fair legs *I'm scared of such words *	The threads of love are weak *Oh your anklets *Your anklets make some noise, steal my sleep, *make me lose my senses *They call me near you, oh my god *My anklets sing songs with tunes, awaken love *They call for you to come near me, oh my god *Oh your anklets *Beloved, you're my life *I want to go with you *Beloved, you're my life Take my hand in your hands *Beloved, you're my life... Serve some steaming hot Rotis. I'm coming. - Hurry up! What's the matter, Kajal? What's the matter, Kajal? Answer me! - Did Ravi say something? He's leaving! You're responsible for everything! You don't have a foresight. Why did he get involved with her if he intended to cheat her? How will she live in peace now? You consider life a stage too! You take life for granted. You don't bother about the consequences. l take your leave, Devdas! I wanted to meet you and thank you for all that you've done... before I could leave I shall be indebted to you forever! I'll leave now! Kajal is not to be seen! I wanted to meet her too. - Mr.Ravi! What more do you have to say? Have you come to inquire... about her after having hurt her? Have you come to see whether she is heartbroken? Why did you make a promise when you didn't intend to fulfill it? I didn't expect you to do this. She has been weeping the whole night! Why are you punishing us for no reason at all? I'll kill you! Uncle! Make arrangements for our marriage. I shall take Sonu along with me! I told you that only an artiste can recognize another artiste. You suspected Ravi unnecessarily. There's lots of work to be done. Let's go! - Let's go! How would I go without you? You seem to be extremely happy today! *Bangles adorn my hand! *You must wait for a while, dear Hello Mom! - Hello Ravi! It's so long since you left home. - I'm fine! I'm bringing home a gift which will take you by surprise! I'm hearing, son! - I've got a surprise gift for you. It's a suspense! The lines are bad, bye! I know what the gift is! I'm your mother after all... no one can understand you better than me! Munshi! Prince is bringing home a surprise gift. Kajal! My dear child! My dream has been fulfilled! Ravi! You must fill my dear Kajal's life with joy! Welcome, daughter-in-law! Madam! Daughter-in-law has arrived! Don't uncover your face! - How will I see then? You may look through my eyes! I'll shut my eyes then! Come! May God bless you! You've filled my life with happiness, son! I wish to shower all the wealth on you?! Invite one and all. Let people witness this sight! Congratulations Sir! What's all this? - Prince is married! You won't succeed in your plan! You scoundrel! You gladly announce a bad news too! What are you doing? Let him go! People are watching! Look dear! I'll immerse this ring in the water and... the two of you must try to recover it. One who wins this game will be a winner all his life. Try you best, son! - I'll win, aunty! Are you ready? - Yes! What's this? This is unfair! Alright! You may play now! Pick it up, daughter-in-law! Bravo! She has won! Congratulations! To you too! Welcome! I'm annoyed with you! - Annoyed!? With me? Of course! You've taken a major decision... without even consulting me. You've alienated me, haven't you? You're annoyance is justified but Ravi is the culprit! Bless me, uncle! - Bless him! - God bless you, child! He is your uncle! Seek his blessings! God bless you, child! May you lead a prosperous life! Sister-in-law! I'm extremely happy! I'm relieved! I wish brother was alive! We've endured joy after a long span! Let's celebrate! Let's have fireworks! *I'm engrossed in your thoughts *I'm lost in your memories *I've entrusted my life to you *I've accepted you *I've accepted you *Love happens only once *l love only you, my dear *l owe my life to you *l love only you, my dear *l love only you, my dear *l love only you, my dear I wonder from where the scoundrel has brought that scum. But you blessed her too, Papa! You blessed her with a prosperous life, didn't you? One must add fuel to the fire to keep it burning! The house can be set aflame with the help of the fire! I too have flicked a spark from that fire! All I'm waiting for, is the right opportunity. All my efforts have been futile! I'd planned to ruin the entire clan. But they're planning to continue with it! Papa! A rotten fruit is always discarded! I too shall tarnish her image! She will be relieved of it only after death! I've to send a few documents to Mumbai,... you must sign them immediately. Thereafter, I'll visit the temple. Do we have to leave at once? - Yes, I've fixed an appointment. But I wanted to take Sonu to the jeweller! You may take her later! I haven't stopped you! I'll take you the moment I return! Hello brother-in-law! Brother-in-law!? Who are you? Where have you come from? With whose permission have you entered this home? Will you reign this palace? Will you bear a child? Will you bear a child? No one will come to your rescue today! You will bear my child and not his! This very moment! Sonu, you! What happened Sonu? Brother-in-law misbehaved with me. What?! Till today, no one dares to see our daughter-in-law... and you tried to touch her with your dirty hands. Ravi, beat him! Virendra Pratap, take him from here. I gave shelter to this venomous snake. He tried to misbehave with our prestige,... I would have killed him, if you have not served for us. Take him from here. I should not see him anymore in this city. Why did you spare this rogue? Why?! Why didn't you kill him? How will I face the world? At whom mercy I was living all my life... what did you gave them in return? Which family do you hail from? Move! Tell me. Which family do you hail from? You scoundrel! Get lost from here. Oh God! How cruelly they had beaten you! Is this the way to beat anyone? It's good that you came on the right time or else... your chapter would have been come to an end. Chapter is now going to begin, Chintamani. Ravi has not raised his hand on my son. But he had provoked my anger. He had sparked the fire which was doused. She was about to kill my son, now I will ruin all her family. Now you can see the real destruction. Please hurry. Now you are married to me... it's enough getting ready. Why are you in so hurry? Your train is not going to leave. Take care of yourself. I will take good care of myself and her too. I will show your daughter-in-law our whole estates... and will be back before evening. Don't worry about us. - Okay. We take your leave. Hello mother! - Ravi! Mother, I am calling from farm-house. Weather is very bad, it's raining very heavily. Ravi speak louder, I can't hear you properly. I am calling from farm house. Here weather is very bad, and it's raining very heavily. We will be returning till tomorrow morning. How is my daughter-in-law? - She is very fine. Ravi, I feel very scared. Thank god, for this weather, so that she will embrace me. I will kill you. - Then, come on kill me. *Beloved, this style of yours, *l fall in love with you *Beloved, this style of yours, *l fall in love with you *When you embraced me *When you embraced me, *Then my heart found some peace *Beloved, this style of yours, *l fall in love with you *This wet weather... *This romantic nights... *Only your name on my lips *There's a fire within and water on the outside *My heartbeats have started to go crazy *Your hair, your fragrance *Everywhere I see, I only see you *On this beautiful body *There has never been so much glow *Beloved, this style of yours, *l fall in love with you *When you embraced me *Then my heart found some peace *Beloved, this style of yours, *l fall in love with you *	Slightly awake and slightly asleep *This atmosphere is slightly lost *l had engraved your *images in my heart *Come, let me untangle your tangled tresses *l will love only you, *and I can't live without you *Beloved, such a beautiful opportunity *Has come for the very first time *Beloved, this style of yours, *l fall in love with you *When you embraced me *When you embraced me *Then my heart found some peace *Beloved, this style of yours, *l fall in love with you *Beloved, this style of yours, *l fall in love with you Tell me one thing, Sonu. Why do girls take so much time to get ready? We men get ready very fast. Wear shirts and pants and ready. And why do you girls take... No! - No...! Come on, chase them. Ravi, are you alright? Sonu, you please go from here. I will stop them. No Ravi, I can't leave you in this condition. Don't be stubborn. - No.- I said go. No.....! No.....! Father! Who?! Who is there? Daughter-in-law, what happened? Where is Ravi? Why don't you speak? Where is Ravi? Speak dear! I am asking you where is Ravi? Killed him. Everyone killed him. Yes. Are you in your senses? Do you know what are you talking? Are you in your senses, dear? No, Ravi. You can't leave me and go. You can't! You can't leave me and go. Oh god, you can't do this to me. Don't you feel pity to snatch a widow's son? You should bring my son alive. You should! See! She is just got married. She hasn't seen her married life. O my dear! You sinner! Do you think that you can escape? I will say the truth to the world. You can only say when you can escape from this palace. I have just seen my son's corpse. This palace has seen many celebrations. Many celebrations! It will face a downfall too. There will be a disaster. I will light your pyre. Take them and lock them. Virendra Pratap, remember one thing one can't escape from God. One day you will pay for your sins. You will pay for all your sins. Pardon me, sister-in-law. Forgive me. Forgive me! Lust of money got me involved in this sins. But, they will kill him... I didn't expect that they will kill the prince. What had happened sister-in-law? Hurry up. Let's escape from this city before any calamity happens. Hurry up. Come on, daughter-in-law. Come on. We will go far away from this city. Search every nook and corner. That three lives shouldn't escape. Sister-in-law, this big tragedy had happened... and you didn't inform me? What to tell Sharmaji, Our ancestors palace has ruined. You trusted Virendra Pratap blindly. What would I have done? Ravi was a child that time. I thought that he will take the responsibility when he grow up? But... Time snatched my son from me? Don't worry, sister-in-law. I will have Virendra Pratap punish for his sins. No, brother. I've to protect whatever I'm left with. Remember one thing, that you are not alone. I am there to help you. l laughed a lot. See, tears have come in my eyes. These are not merely tears, they are tears of joy... that are shining like dew on your cheeks. You are my life. Ravi, I am feeling scared. Thank god, for this weather, for bringing her close to me. l can understand your feelings, yet we have to live. Why mother, why should we live? Because... lf you are there with me, I can live my rest of the life. Tell me mother, what will I do? What should I do? I want to relieve my pain. What will I do, mother? It's enough. Keep faith, my dear. Keep faith. Time will heal your wounds. *I need someone to love me *I need someone to love me *I need someone who can die for me *I'll give my heart and life right then and there *We'll spend our morning and evening together *Morning and evening, o my friend *I need someone to love me *Someone to love me *Someone to love me *I need someone who can die for me *Someone who can die for me *I'll embrace that moon like face *I'll hide that beautiful face in my eyes *I'll embrace that moon like face *I'll hide that beautiful face in my eyes *She won't find a crazy lover like me *All the way from the earth to the sky *I need someone to love me *I need someone who can die for me *Someone who can die for me *I don't have a destination nor a settlement *Friends, I've learnt how to love the thorns *I don't have a destination nor a settlement *Friends, I've learnt how to love the thorns *I'm crazy for love, I'm unaware of the world *The sky is in my arms, the world is at my feet *I need someone to love me *I need someone who can die for me I'll give my heart and life right then and there We'll spend our morning and evening together Morning and evening, o my friend I need someone to love me I need someone who can die for me Someone who can die for me Mother! Are you blind? Can't you see? Aren't we human? What have your parent's taught to you? Kajal! Leave him. Nothing happened to me. Give way. Why this crowd here? Leave him. It's not your job. It's our's. Police can't do anything to Ramakant Sahay's son. He is a spoilt brat of a rich man? He has not seen his mother, how will he know a women's honour? Rich people know to make money but... don't know how to maintain their dignity. Yes, you are right. Today, because of you, I was put to shame... towards that cheap inspector? You are the sole heir of my property... yet you don't do anything only wiling away your time. You may perhaps, forget that you are Ramakant Sahay's son... but this city can't forget. I had never demanded your wealth. Without asking, you have got everything... because of that you are ungrateful and dishonest. Else you would have begged for alms... you would be in the dump. It would be better than this. I wouldn't be under your pressure. What rubbish are you talking? You listen to everything. But you don't understand. This is all destiny. This is all an event. This is all an mishap. That I am your son and you are my father. That's all. Please wait, we'll just come. - Okay, sir! Sir, please buy some flowers. Take it daughter. Okay Panditji. Greetings. Let's go. Take money. Come, dear. Madam, your flowers. - It's not mine. Now, don't worry, sister-in-law. Property is again gone with Kajal's name. Now how hard he try. I will not let a single penny goes to his name. lf he acts smart, law will take care of him. This is my promise to you. But, if he comes to know that we are here... Don't take tensions about that. Come, daughter. Keep here. No, it's enough. Live long. Oh no! Raja, it's your turn. What happened, Raja? Down with Raja. Raja! What happened? What happened to me? That's what I want to know what happened to me. What calamity has come? When I am with you all, I feel to be alone. And when I am alone, I want to be with you all. Raja, you were not like this before? Where is that Raja? - That Raja is dead. I had buried that Raja. I had ruined my life with my own hands. Do you know her face always haunts me? And I always tells her, no don't follow me. Go away from here. But, everytime her face comes before me like a moon from the sky. You are my friends, aren't you? Tell me, what should I do? what should I do? You are in love! Thank to god. Am I in love?! Have I fallen in love?! Raja is in love! I have fallen in love! I have fallen in love! Raja, no! lf you love her so deeply, then we will bring her here? You don't worry. Tomorrow is holi, it will be a good chance. Don't worry. What nonsense is this? - I am craving for you. Leave my way. - I am in love with you. But I don't love you. - But you can't stop anyone from loving. What should I do? So that you will be convinced. Should I lay my life for you? Should I die? I didn't say that. Thanks for sparing me. *Such craziness *I've never seen before.. *That is why l... *Such craziness.. *I've never seen before.. *I've therefore, my beloved *Named you as crazy * Yes, named you as crazy *Named you as crazy *This is my blessing that my lover *Laughingly and with love *Has named me crazy *Yes, has named me crazy *Beloved, at the first sight itself *You stole my heart *Beloved, at the first sight itself *You stole my heart *I became a stranger to the world *And I made you mine *Now I don't find peace without seeing you *Now I wait for you all the time *	I've never seen before such craziness *I've therefore, my beloved *Named you as crazy *Yes, named you as crazy *The moonlight of your love *Has settled in my eyes *The moonlight of your love *Has settled in my eyes *The fragrance of your body *Has settled in my breaths *You're my desire, you're my faithfulness *Now we'll never separate in life *	I've never seen before such craziness *I've therefore, my beloved *Named you as crazy *Yes, named you as crazy *This is my blessing that my lover *Laughingly and with love *Has named me crazy *Yes, has named me crazy *Has named me crazy *I've therefore, my beloved *Named you as crazy... Listen to me. I want to say one thing in this holy place. l swear on this Goddess, I love you very much. And I want to marry you. Leave my hand. l said, leave my hand. What do you want? Why do you follow me? What do you know about me? Will you be able to listen? Do you have courage? Stop thinking about me. I have a past... I am a widow. Kajal, what happened, dear? Why are you weeping? What happened? Why don't you speak? What happened? - I don't want to live. I want to die. Why doesn't death beckon me? No, daughter. Don't say like that. Calm down! Calm down! I wish that Sahay industry to be No.1 in steel industry also. Urgent meeting is going on. Sahay sir is very busy. Why don't you try to understand? Yes, son. - Dad, I want to speak to you. Tell me, what do you wish to say? - I want to get married. Don't you know that a girl is necessary for a marriage? l know that, dad. l have chosen a girl, she is very nice. But, she has been oppressed. In such a young age she became a widow. What?! Are you in your senses? Are you aware what you were saying? Tomorrow the headlines will be that Ramakant's daughter-in-law is a widow. But I love her very much. I am madly in love with her. Okay, okay. She is the same girl for whom you went to jail. But, dad... Don't put our prestige at stake by marrying an indecent girl. Are you aware that you were talking about your... daughter-in-law to be? Listen to me, I will not approve of this marriage. Then you also listen to me. I will marry only that girl. No one in this world can stop me from marrying her. Not even you! Listen! Before this sparks gets into fire, drive that girl away. Kajal! - Mother! Leave me! Mother! Let's escape! Who sent you? - Sahay sir. Everyone knows Ramakant Sahay. He's a big industrialist of this country. He gives lacs of rupees in elections and gets it back with interest! And today, he's done a great job! His thugs attacked a poor woman and her widowed daughter-in-law! Their crime... his son wants to marry that girl. I'm coming! I'm coming to you! You've chosen a nice place. You're insulting me before everyone! We could talk about this at home. Home? Do you know it's meaning? You destroy the homes of people! Don't forget you're insulting your father. If you knew what a father is... you wouldn't destroy your son's happiness! You're crossing your limits! You can behave in this manner. You're like a bubble in water. Your father, Ramakant Sahay makes and destroys lives! So today I end this father and son relation! They are all a witness! l reject your name, fame and wealth! And remember one more thing... after today if anyone even looks at that house... I won't spare that person! I have left everything mother! I've left that world! That name, wealth, property! That father! I've left everything and come to you mother. I'm begging you for Kajal. But son, you know that Kajal is a... I know mother. But what is her fault if she's a widow? lf you want to blame, blame that God. Even after knowing everything? - Mother... But son, she... Mother, give me Kajal. I want to give her the happiness of the world and settle her life. I love her mother! Mother, I can't live without Kajal! Please give me Kajal. I've come to beg you for Kajal! Please give me Kajal. Child, I've lived my life, suffered my share of sorrows. How many days more will I live? Which mother can ask her daughter-in-law to forget her son? Yes Kajal, I'm saying it. You have to live your whole life. Didn't you see in your small life? Here men wander like hyenas. Every man is waiting for a chance to meet a woman who is alone. Raja has come like an angel in this house. He has come here as a son. And he loves you. This world is very bad, it won't let you live. It didn't even spare mother Sita and then you are... Mother, I'll pass my life with the support of his memories. I beg of you please don't separate me from his memories! Else I'll die mother! Enough child! When I see you in this white attire, I realize my son is dead! If I'm suffering each day and living, it's only for you. But I won't be with you forever! Today this boy has come, leaving everything... rebelling the whole world, to settle your life! And you say you won't do this marriage! You'll have to marry! - No mother! For my sake! For the sake of my love! - No! lf you don't do this marriage, you will see your mother's dead face! Stop child! Come forward Raja! Before this world puts any obstacles with it's traditions, marry her! I'm telling you son! Marry her! You are my first and last love. I've never loved anyone before you and will never love anyone after you. Every moment of my life is yours. My every heart beat is in your name. If... I know... I know in you have someone else's memories in your heart. And this... And this wedding night is the union of two souls, not just bodies. And till I don't color your heart with my love... I won't touch you. Move side! Leave me. Don't trouble me. Move aside. Now he's become a decent man. - Don't trouble me. Shut up. Hey bridegroom, how did you like our sister-in-law? You fatso! Why are you all troubling a poor man. Poor man? Look at the face of this poor man. Oh God! Don't touch me. Now I'm a family man. Now I have a wife, a mother. The most wonderful mother in the world. I have to earn something for them. Friends, you know, I don't know any work. I mean... - Leave the meaning. My father has a garage, which is closed since a long time. We all friends can open it. First we used to break cars, now we'll repair them. Take this mother. May my son proper day and night. Isn't it okay? I put 4 spoons of sugar. Yes I can see that. Have you got a lottery? - No. You're my lottery, mother. See, what I've bought for you. How do I look? l don't know to choose a sari, so I bought what I got. And this is my first salary. Your first income, for me? Yes, my first salary for my lovely mother. You have given a mother her son. May God give you prosperity. Mother, you just keep your hands on my head and bless me. You'll see, your son will bring the happiness of the world at your feet. Sharmaji... Dhirendraprakashji. Please come. Have a seat. Thank you. l had come to the city, so I thought I'll meet you. After all, you're the solicitor of our family. Thank you for remembering me. Tell me, what can I do for you? l feel, I'll have to go to the supreme court. Why? What happened? High court has refused to accept Laxmidevi's that will... in which she had given half the property to my son. Now my son is no more and there is no other legal heir. What problem does your government have in giving me the whole property? The thing is, the court takes into account only the proof. And till today... the dead bodies of Laxmidevi, Kajal and Ravi haven't been found. That means you want me to search their dead bodies... and bring them before the court? By now the vultures must have eaten those dead bodies. You're right. But, the court needs the proof. If I don't have a proof that they are dead... what proof does the court have that they are alive? Proof? There is one proof. But a little vague one. You're giving life to dead people. Please don't misunderstand me. Look at this. - What's this? Lakshmidevi had made a new will before her death. ln this, her entire property is in the name of her daughter-in-law... and to be born grandchild. This is just the Xerox, the real papers are in court's custody. And if no proof is found in the next 6 months... the government will seize the entire property. You told me a part of the matter. - And the rest you can find yourself. Three persons have disappeared in the shadow of death. They have a faithful solicitor named Sharma. Your work is to watch Sharma day and night. Where does he go? Who does he meet? To fulfill my demand, you may have to kill many people. In return I'll give you lots of money. A token. The gear was done, check it. Hi Raja. - Hi. What's happening? How are you? - You've come now, I've repaired the car. Give the keys, I'll test drive it. There's a problem is starting. - I checked it properly. Yes, now I'll test it. - While going check the gears. Sister, I'm Danny speaking. - Yes tell me. Raja had taken the jeep, he met with an accident! Where are you going? What happened?! Doctor, don't put this bandage, my mother will get worried. You're acting like a child. Don't worry. I'm young but my mother is like a kid. Carefully. I'm all right. Kajal, I'm fine. Come on. What happened? Where did you go without informing? Why doesn't anyone tell me? Yes, ask her. Now tell her, where you went and what happened? Yes child? Child... How did you get this bandage?! What happened?! Now you are worrying. Nothing happened, it's just a scratch. I was going in the jeep. - Okay. - I was going so I was going. And just like that while driving the brake failed. What! Did you get hurt anywhere?! Mother, nothing happened. I'm standing in one piece before you. Ears, nose, eyes, everything is fine. She too didn't listen to me. That's why she ran that way. I was so worried. She didn't even eat or drink anything. She's fasting today. Fast? - Today is `Karvachauth' fast, don't you know? You... you women are strange. You treat a man like God. You know, today I've got you. Yes Raju. What did you say? Say once more. No one called me by that name till today. Ravi. My Ravi. What are you saying? Ravi is alive?! Yes. - Did you mistake someone else for him? A mother's eyes can never do that mistake. But the sad thing is, I found my son and lost him again. Maybe even he's searching for you. If he finds us, he'll lose what he finds. - Sister-in-law... Ravi will know about Kajal and she'll know about Ravi. What else do we have to see in this time? Everyone is helpless before time, so leave it on time. lf Ravi is in this city, I'll find him. It's been long since Sharmaji shifted his office from here. Do you have his new address? - I don't know. - No? Look where you're walking! You're not in a garden! Put some butter. - Butter? - Yes. Look, our prey is coming. Come... come. Hey! Take out money! What are you looking?! Take out the money! Give that ring! - No this is the gift of my love! I won't give it! I won't give it! No... no! I won't give it! I won't give it! Mother! The wound is deep but no need to worry. He'll be conscious by morning. What's your relation with him? Even I don't know doctor, but there must be something. You? When did you come? After the moon hid in the skies and before the sunrise. My dear, can I ask where you were for so long? Yes, you can ask. I was coming home... when on the way I saw a man surrounded by some thugs. He was alone so I too jumped in. I helped him, there was a small fight. And I've just left him at the hospital and come home. When did you learn to fight for another person? Who knows, there must be someone of our own among them. Now how is he? He was unconscious. The doctor said he'll be conscious in the morning. He's in the hospital and his family is not aware of it. Poor thing. How are you feeling now? I think you are Raja. - Yes. l... I'm grateful to you. - Take it easy. Now tell me about your house or some relative who I can inform. l have a mother, but her address... I'm new to this city. I feel this city isn't lucky for you. Life itself is unlucky for me. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you. No I'm even immune to pain. Can I share your pain? You saved my life, I'm grateful to you. I have no wish now. Death came and passed me by. What does life want from me? There must be some unfinished work, which you will complete. Believe it. Okay, we'll see that also. Uncle, did you see? Mother seems lost these days. Her mind is somewhere else. Isn't it? What happened mother? - Nothing. Are you fine? lf you permit, I'd like to celebrate your birthday in a grand way. And if I don't permit, then too will you celebrate it? Yes, I will. Then why are you asking? - Only to please you. I know. But why do you have to celebrate it in a grand way. We must cherish whatever moments of happiness we get in life. As we don't know in future we may or may not get this moment or happiness. Don't I say good things these days? - It's because of my company. How is your friend now? I never thought a stranger will be such a good friend in just 2 days. You talk about him so much, even I'd like to meet him. Today evening I'll invite him for the party. Can I say something? - Yes. Mother seems restless since yesterday. She gets startled as if her mind is somewhere else. No problem. She'll feel nice today evening. She'll be happy to meet my friend. She'll feel she has one more son. Now can I take your leave? I look forward to this evening. Can I go? - Yes. Are you sure? - Yes. - Very sure? - Please go! - Okay. What are you thinking? I was thinking about the rest of my life. You're fine now. Everything will be all right. What can you expect from me? I'm just a shadow. I have a heart but can't feel the heartbeats. I'm living for the sake of living. You know Ravi, I've never done anything in life. I was useless. But I'm lucky that love has given meaning to my life. Ravi, I want you to meet my love and my mother... who has bestowed me with her precious love. l don't want to refuse you, but... No buts! Today is my wife's birthday and you'll have to come to my house. Today is your wife's birthday too? - Yes. Then I'll definitely come. Come Ravi. You've done us a favor by coming. I'll introduce you to my mother. Mother! Mother, he's my friend Ravi. Ravi this is my mother. My happiness is at her feet. Son, embracing you has given this mother peace. Heaven is at your feet mother, even the wanderer gets his destination. Ravi, come here. I'll introduce you to my love. But be careful, you might be struck by her beauty. So, what do you think? What you said was true, I've lost my senses. I knew it. Just a minute. Come lets cut the cake. Hey! Salim, go down and see what's wrong! Someone check the fuse. Mother! - My son Ravi! - Mother, how did this happen?! I'll tell you everything! Kajal was living the life of a widow. There were problems at every corner. There was no support. Then Raja came as a son... and on my insistence Kajal compromised with circumstances. But where were you my son?! I don't know mother. Fate wiped out many days, months from my life. He is saved! - The flow of time swept me to an unknown place. Some villagers saved me. It was only due to your prayers that I was saved. My life was saved but I wasn't conscious. When I gained consciousness, I remembered you both. When I remembered you, I went to the mansion. The silent mansion was telling the tale of sorrow. Who is that? Kunwarji you! After the news of your death... Dhirendrapratap tortured them a lot. I don't if they are alive or... And now that I've met you.. - I've done such a big mistake! I've done such a big mistake, son! Stop crying son. Come. Come mother. The lights have come. - Yes, the electricity has come. - Yes. It's the occasion, say something about yourself and we'll listen. *My heart remained inhabited with your pain *My heart remained inhabited with your pain *Some memories have faded *and some are alive. *My heart remained inhabited with your pain *Some memories have faded *and some are alive. *What has my destiny done *It has united us in such a weird situation *What has my destiny done *It has united us in such a weird situation *The flowers of our love *couldn't bloom. *I couldn't meet you even after meeting you *How can I bear the pain of my heart *How can I stay far from you *Your sorrow was with me even after you left *Your sorrow was with me even after you left *Some memories have faded *and some are alive. *My faithful beloved, what should I give you *My heart is saying to give you blessings *My faithful beloved, what should I give you *My heart is saying to give you blessings *There is no wish, *the dreams have faded. *I'm dying each moment and living. *l have lost my senses. *I've been seperated with you once again *The world of love remained destroyed *The world of love remained destroyed *Some memories have faded *and some are alive. *My heart remained inhabited with your pain *Some memories have faded *and some are alive. *Some are alive. This one word has separated us. Isn't it? The world has taken the right from me to call you Sonu. Can you tell me whose fault is it? My fault, yours or destiny's fault? I always stood like a silent doll. You came in my life like happiness and went away in death. But I always called you standing between light and darkness. But I'm a woman, how could I take a decision for myself? Look at my destiny, even after dying I couldn't die... and I'm living without living. Death comes and passes me by. Circumstances have brought me at a cross road. Now you make the decision, Ravi. I'm not a God. Maybe now I'm not even a human being. I'm just a shadow. I can't change the past. I wish you well for your present. Come mother, lets go. Yes son, this will be right. Be happy and proper my child. May you get the happiness of the world. Come son. Raja my friend, don't try to change the law of nature. You can't change it, no power in this world can change it. I'm the bygone past, but you're Kajal's present. The past can never change to present. Come on. No! You don't know, Dhirendrapratap... - He has lived his life! I won't spare him now. He has hurt my dear ones. And even I have to do something with my life. Who are you? How did you come in? I've brought a message from Dhirendrapratap. Hey! No need to act smart. - What work... Sister-in-law, I'm so happy to see you alive. Son Ravi, I really feel like embracing you. Where did you go, leaving me alone? You couldn't even die! Why do you make me commit this sin again and again. Where is Kajal and Raja? What's the hurry, child? Have patience. I've waited my whole life for the property. Sister-in-law, you'll have to sign on these papers. This is a small price for the death of my young son. First we want Kajal and Raja! Leave the innocent children! I'm ready to sign! Did you see? My sister-in-law is very understanding. She always listens to me. For the world, dead people can never come alive. Else life itself would be confused. This seems to be the place. Where is Kajal?! - Speak up! Are you saying or else...! - I won't tell! Tell, where is Kajal?! - Tell! I'll die but I won't say! You won't say?! Tell! - No... no! I'll kill her! This girl will again become a widow! You wanted to embrace me, uncle! No! No! The bodies will change but the soul remains the same. I'll come again in some other form.
