(foreboding music) (chattering) [Voiceover] Master, master. What's happening, what's going on around here? Master. 10 kung fu masters, they've arrived here. [Man] Outside. Keep calm, now what is happening outside? The 10 kung fu, they're right outside! They have arrived, already! Go! (anticipatory music) Buddha be praised. It's quite unusual, it is the first time that Shaolin Temple gets a visit from 10 kung fu masters. In what way can we be of assistance to you? I'm the kung fu master of Ho-Mai. Are you the abbot? I am called Abbot Hoi Kong of the Shaolin Temple. I greet you. Why do you all come here. My name is Chang-Sen Feng. Glad to meet you. Oh, and you are the famous fighter, are you? Welcome, I'm very happy to meet you all. We're not here to make any trouble for you, but to make sure about a matter that means a great deal to all of us. Oh, you say a serious matter? Does it concern the Shaolin Temple? (laughs) Why should we come to Shaolin? From so far away, if there is no connection with you? All right, all right. Tell me what it is all about. If it should concern the temple, I shall be fully responsible for it. You have my word. There have been rumors spreading about recently, the Tammo Classic Book has been forcibly taken from the Temple. Is all this true? (laughs) The Tammo Classic Book is a Temple treasure and not easily taken, do not underestimate the strength of the Shaolin Temple, for this is sacred to all of us. The Tammo Classic, is a real treasure, and should you still have it, we will make amends for our intrusion. But if it is stolen, then there will be great trouble, for everyone. How can we take your word for it? So, show us the book. Then we will believe you. Right. We're not just taking your word for it. No, we don't believe anything you tell us. No that's right, we don't believe you. [Voiceover] We don't believe you! So I see now, you do not believe what I say? We 10 kung fu masters are all famous. So don't be afraid to show us. All right, since you put it that way, I will show you the book, as proof that it has not been stolen, so come along with me. Come, come, come. [Voiceover] This way. (anticipatory music) Here it is, see for yourself so you can set your minds at ease. (laughs) There are thousands of books in Shaolin. Who knows if those are the real ones? [All] Yeah, yeah, how can we know, how we do know? If you do not trust me, one of you can come and take a look. Good. Taos Chang will check. To see if they are real, he will represent all of us. Go look! Good, come Taos Chang. Right. Taos Chang look. This is the Shaolin Tammo Classic Book which we rarely show to outsiders. (gong banging) The book is genuine. Here, take it. (smacking, groaning) [Voiceover] Grab the book! Take it! [Voiceover] Got them! [Voiceover] They've got the book! (shouting, bell ringing) - Master, master. - [Hoi Kong] He's an imposter, he's not Chang-Sen, he's not... [All] Master, master. (yelling, cheering) I have the Forsense book. I have the book on Poison! Poison! Yeah, hah! I got the Boxing Classic, Boxing! Mine's on Negative! Mine's the Cave Book! (laughing) Look, the Battle Line Book! Fourth Classic for me! The Strategy Book! Head Technique! Good, each of us has one of the books. Remove our mask! [Group] Right! Now let's go find a place to practice. [Group] Right! (laughing) (ominous music) Huh, hey, look there! OK, come on. It's a pity, the poor girl's been there for three days. It seems her willpower is much stronger than ours huh? Yeah. Hmm, it's a pity, Shaolin accepts no girls. Yeah. Hey! Let's get her to carry the water for us. Huh? What are you talking about? (mumbling) Every day we carry water, why not get someone to do it for us huh? You're right. Huh? Me? Oh! (gasping) Little masters, will your master accept me as a disciple? Please? Hmm, I see you've made up your mind to study kung fu. Perhaps I can show you the way. Oh, really? Thank you young masters. May I know the young masters names, please? I am Ching Feng, and he is Min Yun. Hello! Remember this, to learn kung fu you must start from the bottom, disregard pain and hardship. I'm not afraid of anything! Good, you start to learn by carrying water. What, carry water? Yes, how stupid, don't you know the Shaolin Temple rule? You teach her. Me? Well the first thing, is you have to carry water for one year. Strengthen both your arms and your legs, then you can learn kung fu. Is that clear? Yes, yes quite clear. As long as I can study kung fu there's nothing I won't do. Good, start now to carry water and we'll wait here for you, quickly. Thanks, thank you. (gentle music) Young master. (grunts) [Voiceover] Water, I want some water! Water! Come here, I want some water! Eh, what is it? Here, someone's asking for water. Idiot, stones don't drink water. Hey! [Voiceover] Water, water! Let's get out, let's get outta here! Quickly come on! Hey, wait, wait! [Voiceover] I'm fasting bring me some water! Huh? Come here, I'm thirsty, bring me water. Sure, sure. Come on hurry, hurry, hurry, hurry. (anticipatory music) (laughing) That's good, that's good, that's good. (laughing) (yawns) Oh, now then, my old uncle, I'll bring you some water. Mm. From now on you must pay it to me regularly. Two buckets a month for me to use. Yes sure, sure. Stop! Now tell me. What's a girl like you doing at Shaolin Temple? Oh, all say Shaolin kung fu is the world's best. I'm here because of that. Mm. What you heard about is Shaolin is true. Huh? But the Temple has never accepted girls. Not true, I also thought that Shaolin didn't accept girl disciples, but as for me, I've been admitted as one. Ah, you have been? Who's your teacher? Ching Feng and Min Yun. They told me, new disciples must carry water to strengthen and harden one's body. Well old uncle, I must go and carry water now, or the two young masters will scold me. So bye. Yeah, right. (gentle music) Ching Feng and Min Yun. Ah, those two good-for-nothings are loafing again. Oh Master Ching Feng, Master Min Yun. Why do you carry water for that old devil? Because he's old and crippled. Poor old man, why do you ask me? Huh what? Let me tell you! That old devil is a Shaolin monk who has broken all the rules. You waste your energy carrying his water. Better if you didn't meddle. Oh. Being a Shaolin monk is more reason why we should look after him. Min Yun and I never bother about him. Besides he has a bad temper. And I advise you not to act like a fool, understand? Come on, give me the water. And you do as you're told. Hey, hey wait! (groans) Hey, take the water to the temple gate. Oh, yes! (calming music) Hurry come on. Thank you. Yeah come on hurry! Hurry up! Hey, hey, hey wait! Wait for us! (mumbling) wait! Strange. What's happened Ching Feng and Min Yun? They haven't returned. (laughing) (gasps) Ching Feng, Min Yun! [Both] Master! Master. You have carried water for one year. From today you two can begin practicing kung fu. The beginner's stage only though. Thank you! Thank you master! Oh! I've been tricked! Master, master! Master! Master! Master! Master, master! You tricked me! [Master] Leave us. [Both] Yes master. (groaning) Oh back again are you? What, but I never left! It was me who carried the water. Ching Feng, Min Yun, is this true? Master! Forgive me, forgive me! Same master, same master! How dare you. It was him, he was the one who made me do it. He is the one. She was eager to learn kung fu... Rubbish. How can you do such a thing? Using kung fu as an excuse. [Both] Master forgive us, forgive us master! Please forgive us! For what you have done, you must carry water for another three years. [Both] Huh? This is your fault! Young girl, although you have carried water one year, we cannot make an exception and let you stay here with us. It is better that you leave now. [Lin Chu] Wait! (laughing) (ominous music) Old Uncle, you're here too! [Lin Chu] Yeah. Uncle Lin Chu. Foi Yan, respected 109th abbot. We bid you welcome. (chattering) Huh. Little imp, did they bully you? No, no, only they won't accept me, as a kung fu disciple. Huh? Mmm. Foi Yan is this true? Shaolin rules forbid the admission of girls. Training is for men. Nah, Shaolin has too many rules. Little imp, why choose Shaolin? No, no, no, nothing can make me change my mind. I've decided to study Shaolin. Uncle, please consider carefully before you intervene. Male and female must be separated. I carried water for one year, and yet you still say you won't accept me. Good. They won't accept you, I'll accept you! Ah, you! Thank you master! Oh please accept me! (laughing, gentle music) I want you all to say hello to my new disciple here, here she is, and say hello. [Foi Yan] Buddha be praised. Abbot Foi Yan greets our younger sister. Yeah, and you two rascals! [Both] Ching Feng and Min Yun greet old uncle. - Oh no, please get up. - (laughing) It seems that last becomes first. Yeah, looks that way. Come on let's go into the temple. Uncle hold up, don't do that. No. Stop them! (anticipatory music) [Soldiers] Buddha be praised. Master, look, all of them! What, are you trying to stop me? No, not you. But please we cannot let you take a woman into the temple. Ah? But what if I want to take her into the temple. What then huh? Well if you do that then, I'll do all I can with the help of all my disciples here, to stop you. All right, come on defend yourselves, I want to see if you're able to stop me. So let's see how good you really are. Yes sir. Master, I have no kung fu skills. I dare not enter. Nah don't be frightened, I'm here with you. Now come on. (anticipatory music) (grunting, smacking) Now, don't you run. And you, you rascals. Come back here, young masters. Hey, Master. Hey. (grunting, smacking, laughing) Hey, Master. (grunting, smacking) (groaning) Master, you fought well. You want to try, then? Let me try, OK, Master? All right, I'll teach you, then. Follow me, stick with me, huh? Right, come on. (zapping) Right, up you go. OK, right behind you. (grunting, smacking) Good. (upbeat music) Behind you. You got it. Go on, hit him, go on. Now right. (grunting, smacking) Right on. Buddha be... (grunting, smacking) Master, what is this place? Ah, this is Turnback Lane. Every disciple who tries to leave the Temple here must first pass through this lane. And he has to return, if he should fail. Oh. (gasping) Master! There are some traps around here. (laughs) Don't worry, don't worry, there's nothing I can't overcome. Follow me, but try not to make a wrong move, huh, right? Now listen. First step, you must be careful. Right, second. Sideways, behind you. Avoid the magic dagger. Left, right. Ow, Master. Now be careful. Be careful now. Much. What. White trip. Underneath. (laughs) Master, you're really great. You follow me and you'll be OK. Be careful. (gasping) Head down. (yelling) Good for nothing, there are more obstacles here. Master. Walk on, fear not. Come on. (gasping) Master, this lane way passing is dangerous. Mm. I'm all chaps now. It's worse, but don't you worry yourself. I know how to beat it. So now you watch me, huh? I know we shall succeed, right? Good, good. Come on, move. (dramatic music) Master. Come on. Look there. We are here to greet you, Uncle, and to congratulate you on your skill. Look, Master, they're bowing their heads. That's good. Are you trying to settle this without fighting? You have passed the line. What do you now intend to do? I've come along here for the Tammo Classic Book. What, what's wrong? The Tammo Classic Book was stolen a year ago. By 10 imposters. What? Was stolen? Who was the abbot in charge? Abbot Hoi Kong. He was killed. When he tried to stop them. The Tammo Classic is Shaolin's most valuable treasure. So allowing it to be stolen that easily marks the decline in the Shaolin Temple's prestige. I'm sorry for failing to recover it. Don't worry. (grunts) There are only a few able men left in Shaolin, now isn't that so? I repeat, I regret I was unable to regain it. It has not been possible. Of course. You lack the ability to obtain it. Oh? I'm asking you to try and recover the Tammo Classic Book for us. Mm. This, I think, we should leave to my little disciple here. She'll do it for us. Me? Mm. Three years. Three years. Mm. In that time, I not only get the book back, but also I will regain Shaolin's prestige. Let's go. Right. [All] Farewell, my brothers. Tomorrow I shall teach you the first Tammo skill, huh? Right. (exciting music) Good, good. (smashing) (laughs) Good, good. Master. (upbeat music) Master. Good, now that one. (splashing) It's all your fault, you and your ideas. Now we got to carry water for three more years. Hey. You two, it's been a long time. You still have to carry water? Say no more, we have to carry water for three more years. Huh? Look, look at that, look, will you? What's wrong? (gasping) Let's get out of here. Ching Feng, Ching Feng, Min Yun, wait, wait. (gasping) Come back! Strange. Oh? How come there's a change? A mustache, oh, this is awful. Master, Master. Master. This is awful, Master, Master, Master. Now, what is it? What's all this fuss about? Master, how come I've become a man? Ah. That's because you're practicing positive kung fu. Master, will you tell me, can I change back to the girl I was before? Huh, of course you can. All that's necessary to do is to take up the practice of negative kung fu. Then you'll get back your original form. Master, teach me negative kung fu. I don't like to look like this. Really, I don't. It's too awful, Master, I beg you, teach me quickly. I'll practice at once. Ah. All right, now don't get excited. I'll teach you what you're asking. Oh, you're very kind. The Tammo Classic Book, the last volume teaches you negative kung fu. Negative kung fu... What is negative kung fu? Tell me, quickly. Well, come on now, you must. Negative is... Negative. Kung fu. Negative. Huh? Oh, God, it's awful. I can't remember what it is. You forgot? Oh, no, how could you forget negative kung fu, Master? (crying) Now, now, don't you cry. Don't you cry. Just let me think for a bit. I don't want to look the way I do, I don't want to look the way I do. Please tell me, quickly. OK, OK. Stop it. Just let me think. I can't recall anything at all. Oh, look, Master. I look terrible. Poor child, she won't stop crying until I teach her negative kung fu. I can't remember, what am I going to do? Aha, that's it. I knew I'd have a good idea. (grunting) Master. Master? What's the trouble, tell me what's bothering you. I'm too old. Perhaps my time has come. Master, please don't die, you can't die now. Master, you can't die, you can't, oh, you can't die. It looks like I won't be able to teach you the skill of negative kung fu after all. No, no, no, it doesn't matter about learning negative kung fu, Master, don't die, Master, don't. I want you to send my body back to Shaolin, and I'll try to find the negative kung fu book. So that you can learn the skill by reading what's in it. That's the only way for you to learn it. No, no, I don't want to leave you, my master, never, never, never, never. I can't be, I'm too old. Remember the words, go find. Go. Find the. Master. Master! Master! (dramatic music) [All] Buddha be praised. The body of Uncle Lin Chu is perfect. Shaolin now has one more golden buddha. Bow, you two. Quickly go and lift Uncle Lin Chu into the temple and place his body carefully on the golden seat. Master. Master. (crying) Young sister, how can I help you? You have only to ask it of me. My master's death wish was for me to recover for Shaolin the stolen classic books. I plan to start searching tomorrow. Young sister, you are a layman and a woman. How can you then represent Shaolin? But, but my master left definite instructions for me. Young sister, you have mastered Shaolin's magic kung fu, and it is our hope that you recover the books. Hence, we have no reason to stop you, but we have our rules. Would you, young sister, like to become a member of the Shaolin Temple? Are you asking me to become a monk? Shaolin has both monks and laymen as members. The layman has to pass the trial of the bronze and wooden lane and have a dragon burnt into his flesh before he can leave here. Would you be prepared for that? All right, I'm willing to fight with your bronze and wooden guards. (laughs) You have mastered Tammo magic kung fu. The bronze and wooden guards are not able to stop you. When they meet you, they will be most likely destroyed. By your kung fu. In that case, what must I do to become a Shaolin member? You do not have to pass the two traditional battle lines. All that is required of you is the mark of the dragon burned into your flesh. Good, then I agree to whatever you arrange for me. That's good, that's good. Young sister, since you agree, let us then arrange to perform the ceremony tomorrow. Tomorrow? The dragon test? (gong ringing) (chanting) (dinging) (gonging) (drum beating) The dragon test. (dinging) (sizzling) (dramatic music) [All] Buddha bless you. Buddha bless you. Congratulations, you have succeeded, you are now a Shaolin Temple member. Thank you for helping me. Young sister, when you leave, to search for the classic books tomorrow, I will assign two disciples to accompany you and to attend you. You may choose whom you wish to go. Abbot, it shall be as you wish. I would like Ching Feng and Min Yun to come along with me. [Foi Yan] Ching Feng, Min Yun? [Both] We are here. I want you to go along with Young Uncle tomorrow. And then, when you return, you may being practicing kung fu. [Both] Thank you, Master. Sleeping quarters have been arranged for you, Young Uncle. Come and I will show you the way. Thank you, holy abbot. Tomorrow we will be leaving the temple. Yeah, yeah, we will. Right, hey, I have an idea. (drum beating) (gasping) Buddha help me, Buddha help me, we need money to spend. It's too dry. Student Ching Feng, I bring the abbot's order. I must leave Shaolin tomorrow, with Little Uncle. But the journey is long, and on the way, we shall need money. I know the gold paint is still wet, so I came to beg you to let me scrape some gold for our needs on the way. I beg you, holy master, pity your student's plight. Please, please forgive. Buddha bless you. (tense music) (grunting) It's you. You good for nothing rascal. Old Uncle, how come you're not dead? No, I'm not dead. You had me, too, you rascal. Come here, come here. Master, spare me, Master, spare me. Come here. Please spare my life, Master, don't be angry, Master. Shh. Now then, there's nothing at all to fear. Listen closely to me. Uncle wanted to learn negative kung fu. But I forgot what it is. So you feigned death? Yes, but don't you dare let my young disciple know about it. OK, I won't tell anybody. Here, while I whisper. Go ahead, take some gold. Scrape a bit here. (grunting) Easy, easy. (gong banging) [All] Go now. Master Abbot, goodbye. (gentle music) What's that? (chimes ringing) That girl is real pretty. - Hide somewhere. - [Man] OK. I stole the negative book. Bad luck, woe to me. I am now changed into a woman to be harassed by men. Men are all heartless only. Faithful lovers. I hate all men, I hate all men. (zapping, grunting) Hello, hello, negative. Hey. Hey there. Hey, there. I see no one. We're a little late. Little Uncle, how do you know negative killed them? Master told me, this needle is the fastest kill weapon. The negative book teaches how to use it. Come, we'll search for the killer in town. (gentle music) Come again. This is for you. Thank you. Thank you. Come on. Come again, anytime. Hello, welcome. Nice to see you. Ching Feng, Min Yun, you find out anything? [Both] Not a thing. So it's up to me to recover the Tammo Classic. But, but we looked everywhere and not found anything. Also, we walked all day, and are very tired. - Got it. - [Both] What, where? Woo Don Hills. (banging, grunting) Where did you come from? How dare you intrude like this? (dramatic sting) You're Shaolin men. Correct, we've come for the Tammo Classic. The Tammo Classic Book? What makes you think the book is here? Leave here at once. (grunting) (zapping) (grunting) (smacking, grunting) Let's go, come on. See? (grunting, smacking) (ominous music) (grunting, smacking) Who the devil are you? I'm Chang-Sen Feng. Why have you come here to make trouble for us? We've come to take back the Tammo Classic you gangsters stole from us. Uh huh, did this really happen? You won't admit your guilt? Right, let me look into it. If I find we are involved, I will answer for it. Since you're willing to investigate, I'll be satisfied. (ominous music) I am Chi Fu Chun, Shaolin Temple member. I have come down from the mountains to challenge anyone who has practiced the kung fu of the Tammo True Classic, because their skill is false, whereas mine is real. Shaolin disciple, Chi Fu Chun. Hey, waiter. - Yeah? - [Ching Feng] Come here. Coming. Yeah? Hey, waiter, my shoulder is aching. Go get me a masseur. - Yes, sure, I'll go get one. - [Ching Feng] Hurry. (grunting) Hey, waiter. You needn't go out to look, I can massage. You, you're kidding. (grunts) Hey, how come a woman? A woman. I'm here, who wants a masseur? (chattering) A monks bedroom. You can't come in here. It's not allowed. But I am a masseuse. Oh. Buddha help me, a mix up, a mix up. A male masseur is wanted... [Min Yun] You can't come in here. Your lordship, I happen to be the only masseur in this entire village. Oh, oh, oh. No, no, not me, not me. It's him. Yes, yes, him, he's the way, it's him, not me, it's him. He wants the massage, yes. Buddha bless me. If you insist, all right, all right. (laughs) Careful. Be careful, pay attention, will you? I'm sorry. Which kind of temple do you three lads come from? The Shaolin Temple. [Masseuse] Oh, you've come from Shaolin Temple, that famous temple? [Min Yun] Yeah. (laughter) You three gentlemen are all very young. It's a pity to waste your youth as a monk. Why do you do it? Huh? Buddha please help. Do not punish us if you have heard of what has been said. You will be punished. I'm sorry, so sorry. The time in the temple passes slowly. Everyday life of a monk is not pleasant. Why don't the three of you become laymen again? Huh? Laymen? The world is populated by male and female. If young master does not reject me. What do you want? I like him very much. Him? You like my Little Uncle very much? (laughs) Stop it. How dare you say such things to us, get out at once. You better go. Our Little Uncle seems a little upset. Get out of here. Out, out, out. Out you go. Get out. Yes, out, go on. (gentle music) Our Little Uncle has led us to this place, but how can we recover the Tammo Boxing Classic here? I think we've been cheated by that waiter. I can't guess where the Little Uncle has got to. Let's search the road up ahead. Come on, come on. Hey, you. Wait for me, huh? Now you wait. (liquid spilling) All right, come on, let's go. (laughter) (yelling) He's got us, Little Uncle, help us, help us Little Uncle. Help us. Huh? Who are you? (smacking, grunting) Are you that Shi Pu Chun? Correct. I'm Shi Pu Chun of Shaolin. If you're smart, return the Boxing Classic. No way. (whooshing) Huh? Your hand can shrink. Yes, it can, because I'm not evil. (yelling) (grunting) (smacking) (yelling) (laughter) (grunting, smacking) We got him. (laughter) We got him, we got him. Take him away. (dramatic music) Shi Pu Chun warns one and all not to brag about classic skills and challenges the hidden foot masters to fight a contest at Chi Le Pao. [Both] A contest against you? Very strange. So, the head and foot masters come to fight with me. They look so strange because they're very evil. Who is Shi Pu Chan? Did you hear what he said? He wants to meet Shi Pu Chan. It's clear, he walks upside down, and he speaks that way, also. Who the devil is Shi Pu Chan? I am Shi Pu Chan of Shaolin, and my purpose with you is to get back the Tammo Classic Book. You say you're from Shaolin, well, I don't believe you. Should I prove it? I can easily do that, you know. You win, you get the book. Right. (dramatic sting) You really are from Shaolin. [Both] Give back the Classic. (grunting) (smacking, grunting) Look, Little Uncle. Hmm. (grunting) Please, I beg you, let me return the Classic. Quick, take him away. (dramatic sting) Let me ask her. Yan Cho Yu, tell me, is that fighter Shi Pu Chan here? Yes. But I won't let you harm him, is that clear? Ah, I understand. Is it because you love him? But remember, you're also a man. You mustn't forget that. Rubbish. This is not your affair. So, then, what kind of a person are you? You're helping our opponents. Have you forgotten the path that you, yourself, played in the stealing of the Tammo Classic Book? I didn't. But no matter what you say, I won't let you harm him in any way. Love for Shi Pu Chan has blinded this fella. One solution is kill him. Don't you see that needle bag of his? The needles are real killers. I'd heard that. When hit by one of them, one feels comfortable and then dies, the same feeling as eating candy. To my knowledge, no one can escape from it, once hit, you're dead. Lao, can your skill solve this? No, I'm just not fast enough to beat her. Oh. Well, in that case, we'd better go away quickly. Come on. Mm. You want to try my candy, huh? Now what shall we do, then? We've only one hope, and this is for the poison master, and quick. (dramatic sting) We're in luck. He's here. (gasping) The poison stuck. Sure it does. (laughs) Go quickly to find Shu Pi Chun. And when you return, I'll give you the antidote. We've also been poisoned. (laughs) If you don't believe that, then just try breathing deeply. You'll find out. (groaning) Now just get moving. (laughs) There's no one. Move. He has not returned. Take him away. Up to now, we've already recovered three volumes. When we get all of 10 volumes in our hands, let's take those men back to Shaolin Temple. When that happens, everyone will shower great honors on me. (laughs) I hope we get the negative classic. I hate to look like a man when I'm not. Young Uncle? What's wrong? The masseuse, she's someone else. She could be negative classic. Why think that? Maybe he's right. She seemed abnormal. We've been careless. Let's go back. Sure. Come on, come on, you, come on, move. Quick. Hello, you've returned. Well, well. (gasping) Just look at these fellas. They're our prisoners. Find a place where they can be kept. If they escape, it's your fault. Get it, hurry, hurry. Follow me. This way. Come on, quickly. Waiter. Yes? Where is yesterday's masseuse? Young Master, you want another massage? Yes, all right, then. Right, I'll get her to come right away. All right, all right, come on, inside. Put 'em in here. Come on. (knocking) [Waiter] Young Master, the massage man is here. Enter. (dramatic music) Oh. I didn't ask for a man, where's the other? Huh? Young Master, I thought you wanted a male. Why'd you change your mind? And ask for a female now? Well, go on then, look after him. (laughs) Normally we monks do not ask for female masseurs, but she was very good, so we asked for her again today. We still want her for massage today, understand? [Shi Pu Chan] Yes, that's right. Ah, young masters, please don't fret any more. The woman is this man's disciple. He can do it better. He's very experienced, huh? Let me massage you. No, no, it's for him. Him. He's the one. Oh, no, no, no, no. Let me massage you. Let me massage you. Oh, all right, but make a good job of it. Oh, lightly please. Go on, go. Mr. Masseur, where's the lady today? The child's sick, so she went home early. Tell me. Is she a married woman? Yes. She must be a wicked woman, a no good person. Yeah, she had the nerve to want to marry our. Young Uncle. So, Nan Cun Yu even wanted to marry a monk. The slut. Maybe your disciple is someone we're seeking. Negative classic. Yeah, that's right, could be. What's negative classic? A volume of the Tammo True Classic Book. Ching Feng. Oh. It's a book, is it? [Ching Feng] Yes, you're right, it is a book. Did you see it anywhere? Oh, yes. My disciple keeps a book that may be the one you're after. She keeps it with her always, as if it's a treasure. She is negative classic, let's go find her. It's too late. [Both] Why? 'Cause I'm cape classic. (gasping) (grunting) Bad news, it's not here. (laughter) I've taken them already. Head, boxing, and foot classics are now in my possession. (chattering) (grunting) (dramatic music) (laughter) I'm afraid I'm the eventual winner. Na Cun Yu, bring me the books they have on their persons. (tense music) Na Cun Yu, why do you listen to what that old devil says? (laughs) She has to obey me, with my poison in her blood, only my antidote will save her from a painful death. She must do what I tell her to. (laughs) Devil, your methods are very wicked. (laughs) Give it to me. No. I see you all have Tammo books. Shi Pu Chan has to be dead. In that case, it's hopeless. I don't want the classic. All I want is to neutralize the poison. And then leave for a distant place. Right, I'll help you, but first give me the book. Hand it over. Hey, Sus. Taomi, where your master is? He's not dead? No, he's alive, he is there in his room. That's the best news I've heard so far. Stop. Don't come too near. Come back. Aren't you afraid of what the poison can do? No. I'm determined to go to Shi Pu Chun. He may be still alive. (coughing) Well it seems you really don't want to live. Stand back. You're all mean and petty persons. You plotted to steal the Tammo Classic Book. Heaven punish you. How did you beat the poison? Don't forget, I've learned the classics, all 10 of the volumes. Repent for the serious crime you've committed. Come with me to Shaolin for punishment, or you'll die under the sweep knee. (zapping) Ching Feng, save Na Cun Yu, that's important, quick. Buddha please help us. Do not let these evil intruders rush in. They wish to do us harm. Buddha please help us and protect us from this evil. Hey, what do you want? We want Shi Pu Chun. He's upstairs in the first room. (chattering) Positive classic, what are we gonna do? I don't know. Let's hide. - What do you want? - [Min Yun] Yeah. You, are you the man Shi Pu Chun? No, but I'm fiercer than he is, by far. [Min Yun] Yeah. Tell me, who are you? (laughs) If you don't even know me, how can you claim to be famous? Now, wait and listen to me. If you don't know my name, I'll tell it to ya. My name it is Ho Pi Less. Huh? We have not heard that name before. The name's well known. Once we meet in combat, you will be hopeless, you see? Hmm. You're lying. I want to see Shi Pu Chun. Why don't you ask me? I am his best friend. Hmm. I want to see who will be hopeless. Whether it is you or I. No. Now wait a minute, wait a minute. Let me prepare for battle. (laughs) Right, I will wait. (grunting) What is it? You, go and take a look. See if Uncle's ready yet. (grunting) Uncle, Uncle. We need you, Uncle. Uncle. Hey. He's not ready yet. What are we gonna do? It's all over for us. You tell me what we're gonna do. So, what you're trying to do is to gain time. No. (grunts) (gasps) Chu, call me. [Both] Dragon. Rain. (grunts) (dramatic sting) Ah, you are negative classic. Don't your recognize me? I'm positive classic. Hey. Tell me where the Shi Pu Chun has mistreated you. I'll make him pay. Negative. So, you are Shi Pu Chun. It is you who has injured her like this. Yes. And I want you to know this. It was me who saved negative from the effects of deadly poison. Huh, can that be true? No, I'd rather die. If you die, that's the end for me, too. But... I've lost all hope. Please, once you were a good man, and I a good woman. To change back to our original form, we must unite our efforts. I doubt it, I doubt it. Just trust me. You were foolish, you shouldn't have stolen the classics, it was madness. I've already recovered eight volumes, so return the positive and I will help you get back your original form and your position. Right, I will return it to you. No, don't give back the volumes. Right, nobody's to leave here. He's gone to set a trap. Follow, hurry. Young Uncle, Young Uncle. Wake up, wake up, wake up, come on, come on, quick. He's now invisible. (gasping) (dramatic sting) Where are the lights? I see nothing. (high pitched whistling) They have us trapped, we are surrounded. Don't panic, hey. Who are you? Come and show yourself, if you dare. (laughter) [Voiceover] Now what use are your Tammo skills now? This contraption is my invention. (laughs) One you've never seen before. (smacks, laughs) We cannot fight an invisible enemy. What should we do? I have an idea, let's fight together. (smacks) I've got it, water, water, quickly. Water, water, quickly, water. Water, come on! Water, water. (yelling) Water. Water, come on. - Water? - [Min Yun] Water? We get the water. Come on, quick, quick, we get the water, come on. (yelling) Come on, you. [Shi Pu Chun] Water for drinking, get the water. Get the water. [Shi Pu Chun] Water. (smacking) Come on. We're coming! (grunting) It worked. (gasping) More water, come on, come on. No, no more. Here we are, here we are. More water. (laughs) Here. No, no, no, no. Ah, we see them now. (smacking, grunting) Ching Feng, Min Yun, tie this man up. We got him. We got him. Come on. We've also got all 10 volumes, so let's return to Shaolin. [Voiceover] Shi Pu Chun recovered all the books, caught the robbers and took them to Shaolin. Tammo kung fu proved its strength. Skills in the wrong hands cause a great deal of trouble. Shan Seng summoned all kung fu masters to a meeting at Kung Ming Teng. We admit Shaolin is the leader of all kung fu fighters, but they should not have publicly arrested our followers, we're the masters of 10 different clans, let's go together to Shaolin Temple and demand an explanation. Great, we agree, let's go now. (chattering) (dramatic music) [Both] Buddha bless you. If that's what you masters want, we shall act at once. Hmm. So you really don't know why we've come to Shaolin. Well, masters, explain yourselves so the problem can be resolved. It's the Tammo Books. We want you to release our disciples. All the ones you've got locked up here. Buddha bless you. Your disciples stole the Tammo books. And they happen to be the temple's most important and sacred treasure, hence they have only got what they brought down on themselves. (chattering) You could possibly be right, but you cannot take justice into your own hand. The prisoners are our loyal disciples, and although we disagree with you, we will, of course, return your treasure. Huh? Oh. You got the books, so let our men go. Why are you keeping them? Could it be because you're looking for an excuse to pick a fight with us? No, no. It's true, your disciples are here, in the Shaolin Temple. They committed a crime. And there's evil in them. And what we are doing is to bring them back, to the correct and peaceful way of life. Don't trouble yourselves over bad people. Hand over to me, my disciples, so I can have them under my care. Right. Don't argue, just hand our disciples over. That's all that we are asking of you. (chattering) Hey. Be patient and listen. I have to remind you that Buddha is the savior. Your disciples have caused much trouble. They have committed serious crimes. And their injuries are not too easy to heal. Therefore, I ask you to please be patient. You shall have them, once they are cured. Then I shall return them to you and honor will be served. The abbot's words are sweet talk only. We can't trust him. He refuses to release them, this is an insult to us. He thinks too little of us. Let's get them. Right, let's get him. Buddha bless you. Let us not do anything regrettable, that is, no hatred. We will use force to get our disciples. What is this? Why must you resort to violence? No more talk, action. (yelling) (dramatic music) (grunting) (grunting, smacking) (yelling) (ominous music) (grunting, smacking) (spacey music) (grunting, smacking) You may pass. (tense music) (growling) (grunting, smacking) You passed. (tense music) (howling) (grunting, high pitched whistling) (grunting, smacking) You may pass. Master, Master. (chattering) [Both] Master, Master, they're coming this way, Master. 'Tis bad, a bad omen. This is a terrible disaster to happen to the Shaolin Temple. (laughter) (dramatic music) [Monks] Buddha bless you. Buddha bless you. What is it you masters want? Revenge on the Shaolin Temple? (shouting) We want the disciples. We want our men back. (chattering) If you really wish to cause trouble, you leave us no alternative but to fight you, so choose. Now wait, holy abbot, just listen. Leave those troublemakers to me. I'll soon get rid of them. Hmm, do you want to fight for us? Go ahead. We give you permission. (yells) (grunting, smacking) (yelling) (grunting, smacking) (tense music) Don't worry about formalities. Attack! No, wait. Listen to me. The girl is very skilled in martial arts. She's completed the Tammo Classic training. She's much superior to any of us. So, we'd lose in a battle. We have to maintain our prestige. Therefore, I'd rather die than have to retreat. Look, I have a way, but to ensure our victory, we must unite. We must combine and then fight, as a unit. That way, we'll win. Right, so we'll use the Chin Cun Battle Line. That's the only way to defeat her. Chin Cun Battle Line can beat kung fu. Nevertheless, both sides will be hurt. This concerns all of our reputations. What I say we do is go right ahead, let's attack. Attack! (grunts) (grunting) [Voiceover] The Battle Line strategy will win, but at great cost to both sides. (grunting) [Both] What do we do? What do we do now? Follow me, follow me, quickly. Quick, we need an elder to help us, hurry. Quick, quick. Quick, come on, hurry up. (grunting) They intend to finish you off as soon as they can so you better withdraw now. Right, but the temple may be lost. [Ching Feng] We're bringing out the Uncle out to help you. (dramatic music) We're coming. They're forming a battle line. Idiots, how dare you do this? Don't you know it's sacrilege bringing the elder uncle out here? Yes. We've got to get some help, though. [Both] Elder uncle, please help us, please, please. We're forced to take this action for our good name. Come on. [Lin Chu] Hold it. Chang-Sen Feng, I'm senior master here, how dare you come here without my permission and form battle lines. (crashing, dramatic music) The elder uncle comes to life. (laughter) You all thought I was dead. Master, you... You're not dead. (laughs) My disciple, so we meet again, huh? Yes, elder uncle. Change-Sen Feng, do you know who I am? No, I don't. (laughs) I'm Lin Chu, the last one of the Lin clan of Shaolin Temple. But we all thought you'd been killed. I was hit by your battle formation, and that well finished me. Even one like me. But Uncle. Oh, Master. Quiet. We were wrong, but what of our men? You two. [Both] We're here, Master. Go and bring out the disciples they want. [Both] Yes. (grunting) At one time, we were friends. So let me now try to be mediator in this. Your disciples are reformed. Now I ask for all your help. Shaolin members are always generous with their enemies. [All] Sir. Thank you for all your help. This way. This way, please. This way. Thank you, this way. (laughter) We have saved the day here, and Shaolin is safe. My mission is over. Now I can rest in peace. (laughs) (gasps) Master, Master. Master. [Monks] Master, Master, Master. Master. [Monks] Buddha bless you. (gong banging)
