ONCE UPON A TIME... ...AFTER CHERNOBYL THE CARPATHIAN MUSHROOM Excuse me, Madame, have you seen a short-haired girl? I haven't seen a living soul. Ah, it's a figure of speech. - Which means... - That you haven't seen anyone. - But you are young! - Aren't you cold? I'm wearing four jumpers and this plaid from Scotland. Have you heard of Fort William? It's very draughty there. It's near the Loch Ness. Isn't Loch Ness a monster? No, actually, the monster is in the lake. Is it? I didn't know that. This is my bench. I see the Eiffel Tower, the Champ de Mars is deserted, and I'm feeling good. The vacations are over with all that radiation spreading around. And I'm savouring my remaining days. Don't you feel how clear the air is this morning? It's cold. Goodbye, Madame. - It's OK. - Robert! ...our reporter in Lyon, André Becar. A slight technical disturbance prevents us from hearing our reporter at the moment. An area of 50 square miles in the Rhône Valley, housing a number of settlements, was declared a disaster zone. The estimated material damage is 50 billion francs. The estimated death toll is 117, but the search is delayed... - "Hollywood, "Stucco, Plaster & Co."" - ...number of victims. The Pope sent a telegram to the President of the Republic... And of course not a word about Nevada. - And it's terribly cold too. - ...to visit the Rhône Valley in order to give the victims and the courage of the rescue teams their due. This trip caused heated debates in Rome, the very heart of the Vatican hierarchy. French authorities, on their part, expressed their unwillingness to expose themselves to the additional risk, until the radiation level is established. The safety regulations, adopted on February 1, remain unchanged. The clinics and hospitals throughout France continue to admit the residents of the most affected regions... Ah, the connection is restored. Our reporter... When are we having dinner? Soon. What are you doing? Writing a letter to a ghost. - Have you looked at the "Appointments" section in "Paris Boum Boum"? - No. And what is the name of the ghost this time? Ludovic. - If there is someone who should be dumped... - Well, you see. ...it isn't me. I don't understand what you see in that Ludovic of yours. Exactly. Tomorrow you are going to apply for this job. Yeah, sure. Please, let me finish my letter. Is it you, Dolores? No, it's me. Who is Dolores? Someone who comes here to clean up when she feels like it, to get away from her husband. I'm getting the picture. - Have you been out? - No. Too cold. Why ever did you hang that duck? It's an homage to Tex Avery. Oh, well... I brought you flowers. I can't hear Sophie. She stayed at home. Why didn't you bring her over? Our baby-sitter wouldn't let me. Your baby-sitter wouldn't let you? A baby-sitter? On Sunday? Aren't you hot? I brought you flowers. I'm not touching them. - Sophie was tired and I thought... - Open your eyes! Come and have a look. - Do you see the Sacré-Cœur Basilica? - I do. - Do you see everything around it? - I do. And you don't see anything else? I do. I see the roofs, the pigeons, the television aerials. You can look all you like, but you won't see anything! Radioactive particles are invisible. You flower pot is infested with becquerels. - With what? - Becquerels! Go on, bury your head in the sand! After the Villeurbanne disaster. Yes, but it's not the reason not... Not to accept a pot of irradiated flowers? It is! I might as well take this pot home. By no means! Chuck it in the garbage bin on your way out. I don't want my daughter to become infected. Come now, it's OK. What is OK? Nothing lasts forever. Take that river I so liked: I'll never be able to look at it again. Just because one Friday the eastern wind brought an endless poison with it. Is this the mushroom that lets you speak with the dead? One of them. Then we can talk to mom? Perhaps some other day. This is a very rare mushroom. It appears during cataclysms, exceptional atmospheric disruptions, profound shifts in the natural order. It is born in the cold. But once it's picked it can adapt to any temperature. There is only one things it dislikes: the light. It possesses extraordinary qualities: it can heal wounds, protect from fatal diseases, - prolong life. - You got yourself a rare bird! We didn't freeze it to speak to the dead, did we? It was Marie who found it in the snow! - You only came later. - I'm not talking to you! - No! No. What a dunderhead! Can't even find himself a job! A dunderhead who tells you: "Bugger off!" - Tell your brother to shove off. - No, Ludovic, I won't. Then make your choice: him or me. No! Your brother or me? The mushroom hates being shaken about. Very well. Two... Tonight you'll tell me what you liked about "Madame Bovary". Come on in, Sibylle. - Oh look, "The Traveller's Guide"! - Yes, sure. Intolerable weather! - Good afternoon, Mademoiselle. - No, Madame. Excuse me, Madame. Not at all. Ah, History and Politics... No, History is over here. Sibylle, you can look but don't touch anything. "The Spanish Misdeal"... I'm improving my daughter's literary education. Yes, of course. - 42 plus 9? - 51. - Thank you. No, I mean I'm improving my daughter's literary education. But I'm not forgetting to provide her with a solid civic baggage. Her brother is at the seminary. France needs a reliable younger generation. Women too must participate. - Sure, sure. - Sibylle! - Marie isn't here? - She'll be back soon. What about the job? Everything all right? I have a couple of ideas. It's warm here. I never managed to forbid Sibylle to read comic books. - No, thanks. - One day I enter her room, having knocked beforehand, naturally, and what do you think I see her reading? - Shakespeare? - No. Victor Hugo? God forbid! Tocqueville. Extensive reading is what cements the family. Cements the family? You know, when one's child has a good education, everything else goes smoothly. I'd like Sibylle to own a grand book shop, on the Boulevard des Italiens or the Avenue... - Victor-Hugo? - Yes, why not. Sooner or later children start doing whatever they want. Sibylle has always been very reasonable. Mission accomplished! - Good afternoon, Monsieur! - Good afternoon. - Have you paid for that grog? - Yes, I have. Oh, I can't find the invoices for the "Guide vert". They are not here yet. Look... - I don't have any small change. - That's OK. How do you mean, "that's OK"? Here is the address of the theatre. You'll go there now, Robert. - Bob. How late are they working? - Go on. - Sibylle, what section are you looking at now? - Botany, daddy. - Oh, good. - Off with you! - What am I going to tell them? Tell them you saw the notice on the gate and that you are an electrician. Just let me have a look at this book here. - Listen, Robert! - Bob! Why would they hire me? Do you have "Banana Republic"? By Gaston Miller? We're waiting to restock all of Gaston Miller. Oh, damn! But I'm sure I saw "Banana Republic" yesterday afternoon. Just my luck. I've heard it was getting good reviews. Particularly on TV. - I can't see a thing! - It's a very interesting book, isn't it? Bob, you promised to fix that ceiling light! Sorry, I forgot. You see, Marie, even Jenny calls me Bob. These ladies are fine enough not to apply a political grid to any garment of existence. One of these days I'm going to wall up this depository. - What is this comic book you're reading? - "Grisly and Grismin". - Never heard of it. - It's about a monster who lives on a mountain made of money. - Do you know "Captain King"? - No. - Bob, the theatre. - Yes. - May I? - Dear Monsieur, it's pitch-dark in here. Have you read anything by Gaston Miller? I know his novel "Novel". - I only have Burke's "Traces". - Burke's "Traces"? Look, I'm not fastidious, but, really... - I see nothing that looks like "Banana Republic". - Sibylle! - Was it your daughter? - Of course. - She went away. - You joking? I could order it for you... Monsieur! Monsieur! Couldn't you be more attentive? I can see Bob, but not Sibylle. - She couldn't have gone very far. - Yes, she could. She's gone. When I was a little girl, my father called me Milady. Good afternoon, Madame. The theatre, is it here? - First door to your right. - Thank you. ...where’s Polonius? - At supper. - At supper? Where? Not where he eats, but where he is eaten. A certain convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your worm is your only emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for maggots. Your fat king and your lean beggar is but variable service - two dishes, but to one table. That's the end. Alas, alas! A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a king, and eat of the fish that hath fed of that worm. It's true what he's saying. What dost thou mean by this? Nothing but to show you how a king may go a progress through the guts of a beggar. Are you Hamlet? No, I'm Bob. - And his contact lenses? - What? - "Bob and his contact lenses". - Come now, don't get distracted. You should say that to someone else. Who is always late? Who is never here? That's enough, Rosencrantz. - Today I am the King. The Queen... - The Queen will come tomorrow. Ana María, please read her part. - Shall I read the part of Ophelia? - Stop it, Paul! I'm not forgetting that Madeleine is perishing in the hospital. Ophelia! You see, young man, when you enter the Shakespearean kingdom, you are not... - What is your name? - Bob. Bob... You are not Bob any more, you will never be Bob. You will be Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, Orlando, Iago, King Lear. When I'm playing Polonius I cease to be Jeremy Fairfax. I become a Shakespearean character, a summary of an entire human's life. Ophelia, for instance... Madeleine is dying along with those 300 rescued from the Rhône Valley. Do you think she'll get up from her hospital bed to come and play her part here the next week? She was discharged from the hospital today. What's wrong with her? She suffered severe burns. Because of the accident at the power plant? Don't be silly, the Rhône Valley is the accident at the power plant. Don't get worked up, I'm just asking. She was discharged. They transferred her to a clinic to limit her contact with all that stuff in the air. The doctors are hopeful. She is Ophelia. We'll be waiting for her to get well. What part are you playing? I'm an electrician. I saw a notice outside. - You should have said so! - Yes, but... We've been working without light for three days. Ana María, show him. Done. Nothing to it. Monsieur, my name is Jeremy Fairfax. Will you accept to work for the "Pocket Shakespeare" company under my management? I know nothing about theatre. All the better. And I'm not a professional electrician. Our life is too short for us to be anything but amateurs in it. What kind of electricity have you specialised in? Electrocorrosion. They will plant a garden here. Or so they say. Well, there is room for it. If they stack up those stone slabs here like they did there, where would a garden be? Have you been living in this neighbourhood long? Since I started at the "Pocket Shakespeare": 2 years. I've seen you before, when Madame was passing by. You don't have to be so formal. Where did you live before that? - In Barcelona. - In Spain? - Can't you tell? - I don't know much about accents. How shall we manage when Hamlet is never here? It was Jeremy who told him not to come back. Not a great loss. We might get Germain Brasuch to work with us. He is supposed to come to the audition. Jeremy doesn't want us to play Shakespeare any old way. And the girl from the power plant? She wasn't actually at the power plant. Several miles away from it. They transferred her to Mme Ambrogiano's. I don't know her. It's an ultra-modern clinic. M. Ambrogiano is her husband. He adores the theatre. You know, he is one of the biggest bankers in Italy. He's the one who arranges the Pope's trips. - What's wrong? - Nothing. Just some guy I can't stand. Don't look back. Let's go. OK. I'll walk down further on. I've seen nothing. Enough with these papers in the letter box. I'm looking for M. Fairfax. There is neither M. X nor M. Y here. But... Say, aren't you Mlle Jenny? Yes, but I'm Madame... Could be. It's been so long ago... - But you're not a real estate agent? - No. That's good. I'm keeping an eye on them. They come to intimidate the tenants with their papers. Then a year later a would-be architect comes along and spends less than 5 minutes taking measurements. They sure know how to measure out time. - How many months? - How many months what? Since my father left this house. - Oh, about... - A year and a half? No, much longer. Why? Is he dying? Your door was open, M. Fairfax. Oh, I see, good. What do you want? Joël couldn't come to fix the sink. Joël couldn't come... Oh, the sink. To fix the sink. OK, when shall he be able to fix it? He'll come to the theatre tomorrow. He'll come tomorrow, very well. He's your brother, isn't he? Say hi to him for me. Say that it's OK. We'll be expecting him tomorrow. You play very well, you know. Oh, yes. Yes, very well. You're a great musician. He'll probably believe it. Poor boy. So... World, world, world... The world is a stage of entertainment... Yeah, entertainment, entertainment for those who pay to see the entertainment, not for those who do, make... produce the entertainment. I know something about that. Entertainment, entertainment my ass. He fucked up the whole thing, that boy, with his plumbing, and his brother, and the lavabo... OK. Hey, Marie! - Are you ready? - I forgot all about it. The mushroom. The Water needs to be changed every day, or else it dies. It's silly to shave in the evening. That way I won't prick you with my bristle. You need to learn how do it. Come on, Ludovic. What about that girl from the Rhône Valley they spoke about on TV? Pour in some cold water and rinse the mushroom like you rinse cauliflower. I never rinse cauliflower. There were 48 irradiated victims. - I'm sure there are more now. - Might be. Carefully wash the jar so there's no milk left on the walls, then shake out the water and put the mushroom back in. The wind carries the clouds around. Everyone is irradiated now, only they don't know it. Stop being so pessimistic. Pour in a reasonable amount of milk, tightly close the jar, and put it away in the cupboard. Can you do this at least? Can it really cure everything? Have you seen Pierre-François? He has gained 20 kg in 3 months. He was discharged from the hospital and can work now. They are ready to hire him back at the bank. It wasn't the chemotherapy that cured him, but the mushroom milk. Did they photograph him at the hospital? No, I don't think they did. Who would think of photographing him in his condition? The doctors. Perhaps. Why do you want to know? I have an idea. On the subject of the hopelessly unemployed, - he has found a job. All OK? Here, drink this. There's some left. It's delicious, this mushroom milk. That's the thing! Don't start settling in. - We're going to the cinema. - May I finish this first? Why did you tell me you're from Barcelona when you really come from Bilbao? Paul told me. I don't want to hear about Bilbao any more. Because of the power plant all the waters turned red. - Did they? I didn't know that. - Yes, everybody knows about it. Paul is late. I'm freezing to death here. - Today it's my treat. - You don't have to. - That's why it's my treat. - You still don't have to, so I'll pay. What shall we order? Rabbit? Rabbit is the last thing you'd want. With all the radioactive fallout, the rain, the wind, the dust of empire, the rabbit ears aerials pick up everything. Rabbits even more so. Stuffed quail? And conk out? No, thank you. All the animals are infected. I suggest today's special: ratatouille chicken. Everything is straight from the farm. - Is it? - Two ratatouille chickens. What's wrong? You've never said a word since we came here. I have a terrible headache. - How is it between you and Ludovic? - Fine. He's still lying to you? Sometimes. I can't stand it when people lie to me. It's not without its charms. It's always the same when you are writing a play. Giving me the silent treatment. You can go to the theatre, I'm not holding you. You can't love a man who lies. I never could. My husband never lied to me. - How do you know? - I just do. We loved each other. - Yet you are separated. - Well, yes, we are. I have two seats for "Marius" tonight. We'll lose one if you stay behind. What's wrong, Jenny? "Sale"? - Waiter, come here, please. - Monsieur, would you like to see "Marius" tonight? - My wife has a migraine. - "Marius", "Fanny", "César", labor, family, fatherland. However appropriate it is, I would prefer "The Song of the Nibelungs". At least it's noisy. But thank you all the same, Monsieur. And you? Want to see Pagnol's "Marius"? I have a spare ticket. Screw it. Anxious about going with a stranger? Waiter, cheque, please. I deduce that nobody here likes Pagnol. At once, Madame! When I last went to see "César" I saw Jeremy Fairfax in the auditorium. He probably thought they were playing "Julius Caesar". It's the only explanation. By the way, it was the last time he showed himself in public. A month later he died. - That's the house. I'm leaving you now. - Why? Because this house is sending bad vibrations. But you, Americans, seem to be drawn to it. Thank you all the same. Little shit! - The same thing all over again. Get lost! - Careful! - Are you looking for something? - No, thank you, I've already found it. How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable seem to me all the uses of this world! Oh, that this too, too sullied flesh would melt, thaw, and resolve itself into a dew, or that the Everlasting had not fixed... I'm sick of waiting. It's 5, he's going to be here soon. There he is. - At last! - Let go off me! Let go! - You didn't bring anything the last time. - What are you talking about? First, I did, and then we were supposed to meet at the Monseigneur concert. - But you weren't there. - I was, and even saw you, but you disappeared. I wasn't my fault. - What do you have now? - Nothing. Let him go! Let him go, we'll get him later. "To catch fish." "To fly high above." "To give birth, to give life." "To whisk, to grind up." "To eat." "To deliver, to save." "To cry." "To attack, to accuse." "To plough." "To live." Good afternoon, Madame. I saw your advertisement about the Carpathian mushroom milk. My wife is working. Have a seat. Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you. Thank you. Can I come again in two weeks? No, you have to drink it every week. Really? - See you next week then. - See you next week. I don't like what you are doing. - Don't you want me to earn money? - I do, but not that way. No, Ludovic, please. Not the pillow. Not the pillow! Why don't you stage some other Shakespeare's play? - Or something by Brecht? - No..."Hamlet"... - Is the actor here? - Yes, he's upstairs. "Hamlet" is a beautiful play. I want to prove it. And then, I was paid to put on "Hamlet", not "As You Like It". - And what if Madeleine... - She will be Ophelia! I saw her last week, she's getting better. We'll wait for her and work as best we can as if Ophelia were with us. Does he want anything, the actor? - He came for the audition. - Very well. A great question mark... Laertes is also a beautiful character. Here, take you envelope. The Captain... Guildenstern... Laertes. Let's go and see how it goes. Let's begin. I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us, sir. O, reform it altogether. And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them, for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too, though in the meantime some necessary question of the play be then to be considered. That's villainous and shows a most pitiful ambition in the fool that uses it. Go make you ready. Try to remember and mark the rhythm. You are still very young, but every beat is important. It has to stand out. Excuse me. Well? Did you see Ophelia? It's an excellent clinic and they are taking good care of Madeleine, but... But last week... Today is today. I'm not sure I can go back there. All the characters of the play must visit her. You will be Hamlet. You are Hamlet. As you are now a company member you will go to the clinic and see Ophelia. I too would like to see her. OK, once more from the beginning, please. The tirade for the actors. And... Don't forget, every beat must stand out. Mlle Madeleine Hartmann, please. - Who? - Madeleine Hartmann. - Excuse me. The Ambrogiano Clinic. A moment, please. - Along the hallway and to the right, the 4th floor. - Thank you. Yes, call back later. Mme Ambrogiano is in conference. Thank you. Mlle Hartmann's ward, please. - I don't know. Ask the nurse upstairs. - Thank you. - I came to visit Mlle Hartmann. - She'll be glad to see you. Come with me. She's the only patient on this floor. You have a visitor. Won't you come in? I am Hamlet. I came to tell you the theatre news. She must play. Go alone, I want to walk around. Meet you at the station? I'm not sure. A moment! You? Yes. Come in. What happened to my long lost child? It was you who left without saying a word. Let me have a look at you. The "International Shakespeare Company" is over and done with. Yes... And you're imposing the French language on me. Come on. I'm not imposing anything on you. I'm not a little American girl any more. The girl who used to like cradle songs, unfinished fairy tales, and melancholic and obstinate characters of "As You like It", "A Midsummer Night's Dream", "The Winter's Tale"... I'm married and have a little daughter whose name is Sophie. And I'm selling books. I'm glad to know that, Jenny. I'm not making any reproaches. Never raise your voice. It's so like you. You've always sheltered yourself. What a marvellous coat it is, the silence. You do what you like and tell nothing to anyone. It's you who's been wearing this coat. Since you left the Company. Yes, the Company... I watched it growing weaker, dying bit by bit, and finally disappearing. When mom got ill, you never visited her in the hospital once. Only the huge wreath with your initials on it, that somebody put on her grave. You paid him to do it, so that you wouldn't have to come yourself. Mom wasn't a great actress but she died for the Company. For the glory of Jeremy Fairfax. Fairfax... Not, Jenny, not for Fairfax, - for Shakespeare. It was to rise up to him that I was mounting all those boards, so imperfect, so modest, and now... Modest? You? With you obsession to invite the great names of international theatre. I can just see Olympia and her Italian clique. "Fresh blood, fresh blood"... Always the same refrain. Illness, oblivion and death, - that's what your "fresh blood" is. Nowadays the name of Fairfax is an object of ridicule. I was at a restaurant the other day. Some people there were talking about theatre. And one of them says: "Jeremy Fairfax... Fairfax? But he's been dead for ages." I too thought that you were dead. Not funny. You think that time is punishing me, don't you? Time... doesn't take vengeance on anyone. I've learned to be patient. I came to see you and I don't even know who you are talking to. We'd better meet some other time. Milady. Unpredictable Jenny! My name is Germain Brasuch. - Oh, it's you... - Yes. I'm studying the electric grid. Changing lights is very complicated. If I look at the text at the same time, I get confused. - We're not rehearsing today. - I know. I came to breathe the smell of the theatre. The smell of a place is important. Set the lights to Act I, Scene 4. Was it the first time you saw Ophelia? Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell... You're disturbing me. Leave me alone, will you? Being an actor is a real art. It is. You can't become one just like that. You saw Madeleine back at the clinic. Did you get a look at her face? - I was standing too far away. - Were you? Well, in her eyes there was all of Ophelia. Complete. For several moments that faint light illuminated the character of Hamlet for me. I even managed to see in her eyes Ophelia's death. I saw Madeleine. Not as close as you, but... It was painful to look at her. Painful... She's a great actress. I sorry she's condemned to die, but it won't lead me astray. Now leave me alone. Yes, Monsieur, we'll have it on Monday. Very well, thank you. Goodbye, Madame. Goodbye, Monsieur. - How quiet it is here! - Yes. "Beautiful, Intelligent and Lonely: How to Make a Wise Choice in Love". Who could be interested in such a book? To each his own interest. - What are these? - The books that came on the 15th. What a day! Don't you think we ought to hire a salesman? A salesman or a salesgirl. - You're the boss. - A lot of good it does me! And what about your brother Bob? We never see him lately. He has a job now. Oh, yes. The theatre. Want to swap places? OK. - Right now? - No sooner said than done. - Done... - Yeah. I can't stand this desk any more. Jenny? Don't you think it's time to go to the banks of the Marne? I had a friend once. Every day at 6 p.m. he would go to the cinema to avoid seeing the dusk fall. By the time he was out the night lights would already be on. I don't know what became of him. - He wasn't a book seller, for sure. - No, he was an actor. Ludovic. Ludovic. What are all these jars? What jars? In the meter cupboard. I'm sleeping. I'm not. Why are you smoking? I can't breathe the same air as you. What did I do? You don't even know how to smoke. Have you been selling my books? What books? "The Treatise on the Abnormal Hieratic Script". I've never seen this book. And what about Arsène you mutilated? That ridiculous old doll? You call it that because it's not yours. Go to bed and stop smoking. - Stop smoking! - All these jars... You are lying to me. You are cheating the people who come here. I help them to get well. I do them no harm. I too want to succeed. Marie, please stop smoking. I gave myself five years to become rich. I have four years to go. You'll see. Another of your grand promises. Another one you're not going to keep. Stop it! Your body disgusts me. Your sensuality is all show. You're moving out tomorrow. This is the last night you're going to spend here. And then you can be miserable at last. Listen, Marie, everything is fine. The director is a great guy. He trusts me with the control room. I got paid. I'm taking you to a restaurant. Tomorrow? OK. You know whom I've just seen? The Devil. Well, Ludovic. Hello, Camille. Get me some pastis. Hello, Ludo. - Oh, hello. How are you? - Great. Yes, everything's cool. - Say... - Yes? I didn't quite get that story of yours about the mushroom. - You didn't? - No. - Orange juice, please. - Orange juice coming up. This mushroom is not just any mushroom, - it's a magic mushroom. - Yeah. It's a unique mushroom. It can only be found in the Carpathians. - Where? - In the Carpathians, in Transylvania. - Do you know Hungary? - Yes. Well, it's somewhere there. In the mountains. In the mountains there are forests, and these mushrooms grow at the foot of some of the trees there. You need to know about them to find them. What, the mushrooms? Well, first the trees and then the mushrooms. It's not that easy, actually. It's like a pearl in an oyster: one for a thousand. - I don't like mushrooms. - Nobody's asking you to eat them. It's a super-cure. You mean, like the Superphénix station: everybody rises from the ashes? Stop with your jokes. It's a super-cure, it's better than a financial investment. You can make a fortune with it. - Can you really? - Of course. I don't like that mushroom of yours. What I like is... Look, you drink a cup of milk once a week and live to be a hundred. - You mean you drink the mushroom? - No, you don't drink the mushroom. You let it ferment in the milk, and then drink this milk. - And then again some time later. - But where can we find it? Nowhere. I have this mushroom. 200 francs a glass. Look, I had a fight with Marie yesterday. I can't stay with her any more. We have nothing left to talk about. So, you see, I don't know where I can sleep tonight. At an hotel, all alone... So, here's the deal: I give you a free glass of mushroom, and you let me stay at your place tonight. You can stay if you like... - But I don't care about your mushroom. - Look, let's wait and see. Let's go to your place and talk it over. I need a guy like you. Your Ludovic is up to his old tricks again. He's scheming with somebody again. Who is this? I'm Ludovic's friend. I came to get his stuff. Wait here. Everything is here. It's cold outside, you know? I know. Well, see you soon, maybe. Maybe. Signor Ambrogiano, please. It's Signora Ambrogiano. Hello? Hello, it's you? Yes, it's me. Oh, I didn't sleep well. Got trapped again. Pasta at the Kubricks'. Disgusting! What a night! Well, you know the Kubricks. A contest in bad taste. I'm better off sitting here and getting bored in blessed loneliness. You're coming back tonight? Which flight? Will you have time to pass by the Villa Condotti? Oh, you already did? Why can't I get it into my head that I have an extraordinary husband! Fairfax? Did he manage to get in touch with you? What a talent! Of course. Of course I like her if you think she's adorable. But the poor girl is too weak. She was lucky the patrol found her. One has to be blind not to see that she'll be unable to adjust to normal life. He makes all his actors go to the clinic but has never been here himself. He asked for a delay? Three months? And you can't decide? Well, it really is a drop in the ocean for the Pope's annual budget. Not at all. No, I'm not being mean about the Pope, I just think that if he didn't travel around in his hermetic box so much he would have enough money to buy the equipment for my irradiated patients wing. That's all. Bourguignon is of the same mind as I. What are you doing here? I'd like to know if you have the "Denver" perfume for sale. - We're not an American hospital. - But... Go back to your ward. The 4th floor is off bounds for you. What are you doing there? I came to see Mlle Hartmann. I'm looking for her ward. She is in number 309. You should use the hallway. It's not that difficult. What is this Sacrament? It's a mushroom my sister found. It can cure everything. - Let me see. - No, there's too much light here. - What do you call this thing? - The Carpathian mushroom. Carpathian... - Who told you it can cure everything? - Well, it can. I heard of a cancer patient who was supposed to die within 2 month and made a complete recovery after drinking the mushroom milk. Here's what we'll do: you'll leave it here, and I'll have it analysed. If the test result is positive, I promise I'll give it to Madeleine. If not - into the rubbish bin it goes. - The theatre smells so nice. - It smells of dust, mostly. Dust is part of the theatre. I would prefer it to be otherwise. I would love to live in this theatre. And I... If I could, I would spent all my time at home. Away from all the troubles of the world. Frankly, I'm glad to have switched turns with Germain. I'm not a weakling but... seeing Madeleine in a state like that... She'll get better. The blonde nurse told me so. You wish! Irradiated patient don't live long. Can't you be quiet? Stop daydreaming and help me. I'll be in my dressing room learning my lines. Are you going to stay here? What do you mean when you say "here"? I mean stay here today, now. I'm going to rehearse my part. Even a blind man would know you're Hamlet if he could see you. We'll have a little séance. - A little séance? - Yes. We'll try to talk to the dead. - Does it work? - Of course. Would you like to take part? It works better if there's four of us. I'm open to all and every experience. Sit down. We'll wait for the fourth one. Focus your minds. The plastic gets in the way. E... I... N... S... T... E... I... N... Ein-stein... Eins... Tein... No, it's "Einstein". Einstein? The scientist? What is he saying? The fire... the ashes... have spread... over the earth. No place indeed should murder sanctuarize; revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes, will you do this? Keep close within your chamber. Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home. I will do't! And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword. I bought an unction of a mountebank, so mortal that, but dip a knife in it, where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare, collected from all simples that have virtue under the moon, - can save the thing from death... - You're on, mate. - Yes, OK! - Oh, excuse me. - Where were we? ...and, in a pass of practice, requite him for your father. I will do't! And for that purpose I'll anoint my sword. I bought an unction of a mountebank, so mortal that, but dip a knife in it, where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare, collected from all simples that have virtue under the moon, can save the thing from death that is but scratch'd withal. I'll touch my point with this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly, it may be death. Your electrician told me everything. Shakespeare rendered in French, irradiated Ophelia, a clinic in the suburbs, actors who aren't there half the time. I detest the theatre and you egotism, but I came to tell you that I'm ready. I will take part in your work for the last time and write your story. I have quite a bit of time before me yet. At the moment I'm waiting for Ophelia to get well. I'm confident she will. I have a part for you: the Queen. Blackmail. But OK, I accept. And I'll write your story, my pompous one. Is Marie here? No. She went home. Can I have a look at the books? Of course. Will Marie be back? No. I'm closing up soon. And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepar'd him a chalice for the nonce; whereon but sipping, if he by chance escape your venom'd stuck, our purpose may hold there. - But stay, what noise? How now, sweet queen? One woe doth tread upon another's heel, so fast they follow. Your sister's drown'd, Laertes. Drown'd! O, where? There is a willow grows aslant a brook... There with fantastic garlands did she come of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples, that liberal shepherds give a grosser name... My kingdom for a horse! ...but our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them. No, I've never played Shakespeare since then. I thought there was some project with Strehler? No. Three years ago I acted with the students at the Yale University. Yet do I fear thy nature... And then, I leave Shakespeare to the young. Because they carry a flame inside them. And the old folk upstairs? Do they carry a flame inside them? I took on Jenny again. Have you seen her? She doesn't resemble me in the least. She's old. There is no flame inside her. Only matches. And what about your French Shakespeare? Is it turning out well? If "Hamlet" is a success, I want to do... - Let me guess, let me guess... - "The Tempest". Oh, what a moron! What a moron! I thought you'd do "The Merry Widows of Windsor". And I would play Falstaff. In all languages: Hungarian, Greek, Turkish. What a moron! Do you know this, at least? Alas... Alas or not, I choose my own poison. What about cinema? Cinema? Cinema, cinema, what does it rhyme with? There is a willow grows aslant a brook, that shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream. There with fantastic garlands did she come of crowflowers... ...did she come of crowflowers... Damn! My poison! ...of crowflowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples, that liberal shepherds give a grosser name, but our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them. There on the pendant boughs her coronet weeds clamb'ring to hang, an envious sliver broke... Mme Ambrogiano? - I didn't hear you knock. - I want to change floors. I'm sorry, but it's impossible. You will not change floors. - Are you hot? - I'm handing in my notice. Your service requires a sacred fire. That Carpathian mushroom could save Madeleine. I've never seen irradiated patients cured by infusions, or noble impulses. I know about this mushroom. It comes from Tibet, not the Carpathians. And its virtues still need to be proven. - Have a seat. - No! As you like. I've seen it all: the nuclear test victims from Nevada, the impossible cases of the Three Mile Island Accident, the sufferers of the Minamata disease. Chernobyl. Chernobyl... Along with the whole world, we've been painstakingly kept in the dark. And now what they are referring to as "the Rhône Valley" to avoid naming the actual towns... I don't play around with electricity, I do what I can. With what I have. And it's not much. People don't mix well with other people, and with plants... You can imagine. But can't you at least try? I don't pretend to be a machine for curing people. - Let me use my methods. - But Doctor... - No buts. We have our medical approach. We've spent 25 years developing it, Professor Bourguignon and myself. Our methods are rather uncertain, I admit that. But every month people from Japan write to me to express their gratitude and to ask me to travel over there. So I too could close the shop down and leave. But I like this clinic. Put on your coat. Up to now, you've been helping Madeleine by working here. So... It's on the 4th floor that we need you. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I want to drop by Marie's before we leave. - Today? - Yes. I'll go now. I won't be long. But it was you who wanted to go to the Marne. I told you I wanted to go to the seaside. I didn't say the Marne. Didn't you? And I thought you meant the Marne. If you don't want us to go there... If we go, we'll have to take the train. We'll go there to get some air. Keep your eyes on the shirt when you're ironing it. Keep your eyes on the shirt when you're ironing it. Have you known Marie for long? Her, not really. I know Ludovic. And I don't see why Marie showed him the door. - And you're going there to find it out? - No, I'm going there to get a mushroom. We'll find many more of them on the bank of the Marne. But there are no mushrooms there that cure everything, like Ludovic's. Ludo and I want to have it analysed. It's at her place now. - Ludovic? - No, the mushroom. We could try it on that irradiated girl who acts in your play. Why do you want to analyse it? You're either sure of it or not. Of course I'm sure. By the way, a doctor took interest in it and wants to buy it from us. Either use it to save somebody or drop it. Yeah, sure. See you soon. Today everything lies: safety advice, chicken and rice, nearby high-rise, theatrical guise, amorous ties, weapon supplies, men's alibis... All lousy lies. Even my lover lies. Looks me in the eyes and lies. How nice! Did we pay the fencing master? Of course. He should be informed that we stopped the rehearsals. I cancelled the orders for the costumes. - Oh no! - They cost us a fortune. We worked so hard to get hold of them. Vittorio Ambrogiano... M. Fairfax, my husband asks to excuse him, he got delayed in Rome. What a tragic affair. Cheerful affairs are a rarity here. All the same, I have good news for you: you have time to put on your play. And I'm returning this to you. I don't see how it could be of use. Call at once and have the costumes brought back. - Will you permit us to make a call? - Certainly. Certainly. "Hamlet" will be staged sooner or later. - Do you remember the mushroom, Bob? - What mushroom? The one I found at the foot of the Eiffel Tower. - When it was snowing hard. - Oh, yes. The mushroom began to breed. Ludovic wanted to start selling it to the people in the neighbourhood. I broke up with Ludovic and got rid of all the jars except one. Except one. Ever notice how things sometimes disappear from the flat? A mushroom is not a thing. True. But it's gone. Subtitles by: Weimar
