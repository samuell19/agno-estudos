[dramatic music] [music playing] [singing in french] He said tome, I'll show you a world just made of love for you and me. [french] I found something new-- a shining light into your eyes. And then he came to me like a soft melody. He gives me silently andbrings me through his dream. --distant blues away from me. The heightened experiencewill be familiar with my thesis that the suppression of what I term natural or animalresponses within the sexes will lead to severe, eventraumatic, emotional damage. In order to understand this fully, we must first define what isthe natural emotional response? And in particular, what are its implications in female sexual behavior? In recent weeks, I have initiated a study group, selecting from the many women who have responded to my writings on the subjectas careful a cross-section as possible. Women from every walk of life, but all have one thing in common-- a desire to expand their emotional frontiers beyond boundaries imposed by their peer groups or their circumstances. The central reference point for the experiment is a chain of totally anonymousautomated clinics to which these women will come to seek reassurance and the ideal surroundings toallow their emotional fantasies into the light of day. Closely guarded secretsof repressed sexual desire will be revealed without fear of recrimination, to be savored and enjoyed. I have selected Venice, Italy as the site of the first of these clinics. It's Carnival time now. And many women inanguish, on the threshold of new experiences will seek my help to learn more about themselves. I have called my experimental clinic the ORganization forCHaracter and Independent Development Studies. As you can see it makes a neat acronym-- ORCHIDS. And so I have called my experimental clinic The House of Orchids. MAN [RECORDING]: We need your total relaxation. Experience has taught us that the human body is most at ease while floating. Therefore, we ask you, as thefirst step of the journey we will be taking together,through the realm of your senses to disrobe and enter the water. Punch your code numberinto the panel on the wall. And you will enter yourindividual inner sanctum-- [soft romantic music] [beeping] --to disrobe and enter the water. Everything? MAN [RECORDING]: As you slideinto the constantly controlled body temperature bath, you will feel all tension leave your body. Lie back and enjoy the sense of inner harmony you will experience andspeak about yourself aloud. [soft romantic music] Punch your code numberinto the panel on the wall, and you will enter yourindividual inner sanctum. Hey, I didn't come here totalk to a bunch of machines. MAN [RECORDING]: Punch your code number into the panel on the wall, and you will enter your individual-- All right. I heard you the first time. [beeping] I'm married. But it's going wrong. No children, thank God. I used to be a model-- very successful, fashion mostly. Now I'm in business, my own business. I've built up a chain of giftshops, expensive gift shops-- leatherware, jewelry, glass. That's why I'm here in Venice, to buy glass. I discovered I have a flair for business. It hasn't been easy. While my bank account growsprogressively more healthy, I find myself becomingprogressively more depressed and losing touch with something,something pretty important-- me or, rather, the woman in me. Oh. Ah. Ah. I don't mind that-- I mean, running the bookshop,looking after my father. It's just that I never get out. I never meet anyone. Daddy can't be left alone. He demands attention all the time. So all I have are these dreams. I mean, I could go out. But I wouldn't know where to go. I've missed so much-- things-- things other peopledo, things I only read about. I need someone to help me. Plastic? How can you say it with plastic? Hey! I hope you change the water in here. Ah, OK, you win. My name is Suzy Randall. I'm 30 years old, andhave just had $70 million dumped in my lap. My parents crashed and killed themselves in a light plane over Hawaii-- hit a mountain, missed-- end of sad story. It's out of probate. Well, here I am-- stinking rich and up to my assin lawyers, brokers, bankers, experts of every kind. It's so exciting, which is why I'm here. Your brochure said you couldmake fantasies come true. Well, I have a fantasy I work on all the time. I love to control people. And the girls who come herehave their defenses down, don't they? So I'll make a deal-- sign them over to me. Keep on pushing them on me. And when I find somethingI like, I'll let you know. OK? What I want is lust-- good, old-fashioned, simple, and direct. I don't even want anyone to know who I am. Oh. MAN [RECORDING]: Do notexpect any dramatic changes or developments in your lifestyle. Any experience opportunities presented to you will be so shaped as to fitinto your present way of life. Oh, sure. MAN [RECORDING]: You, for your part, must be ready to take advantageof any such opportunity. Yeah. MAN [RECORDING]: Haveconfidence in us and, above all, in yourself. We will be looking forwardto hearing of your progress. Am I going to show you. [upbeat instrumental music] Do you want something? Yeah, well, anything-- coffee. Excuse me. I have to go. I-- - But your coffee. Forget it. I don't want it. It's-- oh, you win. Prego, Signora. Here. Grazia, signora. [upbeat instrumental music] [distant bells chiming] JEFFREY [ON PHONE]: Yeah? Hello. Who is this? Hello, darling. It's me. JEFFREY [ON PHONE]: Who? Me, your wife, darling. T, I'm busy right now. Can you make it quick. Jeffrey, I'm looking outover the sparkling water of this old city. And it's just perfect. As a matter of fact, it's kind of sexy. Sexy-- know what I mean? JEFFREY [ON PHONE]: T,will you get to the point? I haven't got all day. It's warm. I wonder what it's like at home. Oh, darling, I miss you. Is it raining? What did you do? Call me up to ask for a weather report? No. I'm calling to make one lasttry to make our marriage work. I want you to hop a planeand come here today. It's-- it's different, Jeffrey. We could make it work. We've been all through that. I can't get away right now. I'll be there Saturday, I promise. Jeffery, this is important. So is my business-- to me it is. [ANGRILY] Don't be so-- oh, for god's sake. Look, Jeffrey, there are thingsI'm getting into that, well, if you were here, it wouldmake all the difference. Look, I don't want to just talk about it now. Just relax. Take a vacation. Enjoy yourself. Meet some men. We'll talk about it when I get there. You bastard. [phone clattering] You went out, didn't you? Just for a little while. A little while is all I've got. Where did you go? Here, just shopping. There were things we needed. Everyone delivers. You don't have to go out. You want to go out. You leave me alone. You don't care. You don't care. To think that God took yourmother in exchange for you. [sobbing] It wasn't my fault. [soft romantic music] MAN [RECORDING]: Punch your code number into the panel on the wall, and you will enter your individual inner sanctum. [suspenseful music] Now, speak. I'm a hooker and a good one. But sometimes, I thinkit would be such a luxury to be able to cry and to havea man put his arms around me and comfort me. You see, they all think of me asa machine for giving pleasure. And machines like that aren't permitted to have emotions of their own. You might say I workedmy way through the ranks. When I was 14, my father's bestfriend seduced me with $100. I suppose I-- I blew it on something like ice cream. And since then, I've always demanded money to sleep with a man. Now, I run my own house, live in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and business couldn't be better. But even so, I long to have a relationship with a man who sees me as another human being instead of a convenience. For once, I'd like to do it with a friend instead of play acting or beinghumiliated just to bolster a middle-aged trick's limp ego. At times like that, I think it would be nice to be married, havechildren, live in a small town or on the beach in California. To be called mama every day-- yes, that would be nice. MAN [RECORDING]: Do notexpect any dramatic changes or developments in your lifestyle. Any experience opportunities presented to you will be so shaped as to fitinto your present way of life. [upbeat instrumental music] [non-english speech] [non-english speech] Grazia. Buongiorno. Didn't you know? The Orchid Organization always appoints someone of your own age, you know, to help you through the first experiences. Oh. Anyway, this time they chose me. Hi. My name's Suzy. Don't look so worried. It's supposed to be fun. [soft dramatic music] Please wait for me. Mrs. Ross? Yes? Is Mr. Bardini here today. I think you mean my grandfather. Unfortunately, no. You see, he died last year. Oh. I'm so sorry. I-- do you know who I am? Of course. I found your name on the books. I've been trying to get thembalanced ever since I arrived so I can sell the place. But why are you selling the workshop? Oh, I guess it's an old story. My grandfather loved glass. But unfortunately, heknew nothing about money. The business was losing for years. And with inflation-- You don't sound Italian. Well, I could work on my accent then. But I was brought up in the United States, so it's a bit rusty. This is bad news. Your work sells very well in my boutiques. It might be wise to increase my normal order while you're still in business. Oh, that would be wonderful. I'll just get my order book and be right back. Hmm. It's an improvement. But it's too obvious-- something more subtle, moreenticing would be better. Oh, and we don't need this. Take it off. It ruins your shape. Where are you going? To the changing room-- you said-- Oh, come on, Dena, just take it off. Losing your inhibitions is lesson number two. Well, turn around. Let me see you. Suzy, please don't rush me. I don't have to doanything for you or to you. Just say the word, and I'll walk away, and you won't even know I'm alive. No, Suzy, please. I need you. So turn around. I can't go around like this. It's as if I have nothing on. Oh, that would be even better,except we'd get arrested. Relax. Like this, they can see you're beautiful. Now, let's see how you look in this. [music playing] [singing in french] I found something new-- a shining light. It's time for lesson number three-- how to make use of a man. [SINGING] And then he cameto me like a soft melody. He builds me silently andbrought me through his dream. [singing in french] away from me. [french] He said to me,I'll show you a world just made of love for you and me. [french] I found something new-- a shining light into your eyes. And then he came to me like a soft melody. He builds me silently andbrought me through his dream. [singing in french] away from me. And then he came to me like a soft melody. He builds me silently andbrought me through his dream. [singing in french] away from me. Grazia. Excuse me. Where did you just take that lady? Come on. We're going for a ride. Hey, Dena! [distant bells ringing] DENA: I don't think I should be doing this. What if my father realizes I'm gone? SUZY: [laughs] That's lessonnumber four-- never be a slave to anyone but yourself. [knock at door] Who is it? MAN: The bellboy, Signora. A package for you. For me? Are you sure? Quite sure. Signora. [soft dramatic music] We won't be long. Can you wait for us? Why have we come here? Because I want some information. May I help you? Are these for sale? Everything is for sale, including the factory. This is very interesting. I don't think I've ever seenanything like it before. It's a regular item. Tell me, would it be possible to have a life-size cast made of glass. I mean, an exact reproductionof a living person? Sure it is, but a special order like that would be expensive. You see, first there's the mold. And then-- Oh, expense would be no object. I see. Well, what did you have in mind? SUZY: No head, no arms, just-- Uh-huh. Well, I could make a special order for you. Look, if you come back tomorrow morning, we can start work on it. I want it now. You do realize that to makethe casting you will have to-- SUZY: Oh, it's not a cast of me I want. It's of my friend. [telephone rings] Jeffrey? MAN [ON PHONE]: I see you're holding my gift. You can see me? Where are you? Who are you? MAN [ON PHONE]: It's a beautifulflower, the orchid-- almost as beautiful as you, Mrs. Ross. Wait a minute. How do you know my name? MAN [ON PHONE]: When I sawyou standing on your balcony this morning I had to know whatsuch a beautiful apparition was called. It's a lot more than I know about you. MAN [ON PHONE]: Invite me over. And we'll have our own quiz show. You mean right now? MAN [ON PHONE]: Any time you like. What would my father say if-- if he could see me now? When will it be ready? Oh, we can pour the glassimmediately-- say tonight? Come in. Come in, quick. It's beautiful. Yes, it is. Would you like a drink? Oh, thank you. Would you like to take a seat? OK. Would whiskey be OK? Fine, thank you. That's very kind of you. Not at all. I always find that at times like this, a drink is just what the doctor ordered. I find alcohol very relaxing. On the rocks? I prefer whiskey to abeautiful flower on the rocks. Oh, how silly of me. It's just that I've never donethis type of thing before-- with a stranger, that is. I find it most disconcerting. Well, actually, I've neverdone it with someone so young before. In the bathroom. Hurry. DENA: Why are you doing all this? SUZY: Because it's what you need. You can't be a mouse your whole life. DENA: I know. But that cast-- well, it was humiliating. I felt just awful. And then that silly worker dropped molten glass on my clothes. SUZY: How many girls wouldlove to have their boobs immortalized in glass? It wasn't meant to behumiliating but a tribute to a very desirable body, even though you're hiding it under my coat. You're still a virgin, aren't you? DENA: Yes. SUZY: I think it's time for your next lesson-- getting to know about the wonderful things you can do with your body. Don't forget this now. Whenever you say. [cheering] SUZY: Venice at carnival time is one of the most exciting cities in the world. How many of those people out there are hoping they'll get laid today? DENA: Oh, come on. You only think about sex. SUZY: Because it's whatmakes the world go round. Come on. It's time for lesson number five. [music playing] [SINGING] --for you and me. [french] I found something new-- a shining light into your eyes. And then he came to me like a soft melody. He gives me silently andbrought me through his dream. [singing in french] away from me. [french] He said to me, I'll show you a world just made of love for you and me. [french] I found something new-- a shining light into your eyes. And then he came to me like a soft melody. He gives me silently andbrought me through his dream. [singing in french] away from me. And then he came to me like a soft melody. He gives me silently andbrought me through his dream. [singing in french] away-- Now you know what pleasure hides in all those hills and valleys you have. DENA: I never knew it was like that. Oh, Suzy, I love you. Hello? MAN [ON PHONE]: Hello. Remember me? That was quick. Want a replay already? MAN [ON PHONE]: I don't understand. A replay of what? [ANNOYED] Well, that's a hell of a compliment. MAN [ON PHONE]: We must havemy wires crossed, my treasure. Look, when you want me to come over, flick your lights on and off twice as a signal. Signal? But-- but you were here just now. Didn't we? Hold on just one moment. [READING] You are invitedto an exhibition of glass. Oh my god. It wasn't you just now. It-- It was a delivery boy. [laughs] It's fantastic, really magnificent. Yes, it did come out well. Listen, do you think Icould make another casting? You see, we have a tradefair coming up next month, and well, it would look good on our stand. Oh, it would be amusing to bring Dena along to look at herself. You don't approve? It's not my business. It's just a game. A dangerous game. I didn't buy Dena, you know. Oh, maybe I'm making too much of it. I appreciate your concern. I would like to see Melissa. Prego. Please, just a moment. [soft romantic music] [moaning] Hey, that's wild. Yes? Hi. I'm Suzy Randall of The House of Orchids. You're joking. No way. Anything wrong with that? MELISSA: I wasn't told toexpect a personal visit. Oh, I'm not your counselor. I'm something like a liaison. Oh? What do you want? Some help. There are things you canarrange much easier than us. Such as? Other women's fantasies. You could be very helpful. That's funny. I come to you for help. But you come to me for the same thing. Quid pro quo. You'd be paid, of course. Of course. Hi, Suzy. Dena meet Melissa. Hello. Well, what do you think of it? It's beautiful. It's you. Well, say something. Please, no, not here. Why not? People will see it. That's the point. But they won't know it's you. They'll just admire it. Where are you taking it? I think it'll look really wonderful on show in the front window. Who's going to know it's you? Now, let's see if our attention-getter works. Oh, we might catch a fishsooner than I thought. That's an interesting itemyou have on display there. Is it for sale? No, it's a special order. Sorry. TERESA: Are the orchids significant? Very. If there's something you would like to discuss? Possibly. I'm staying at the Hotel Metropole. The name's Ross, T. Ross. Is she the one you told me about? Yes. Do you think we could arrange something? I guess so. But how do you know she'll come? Simple. I'll send her an orchid and your address. She'll come. You see. I told you it would go over well. Oh, my coat-- look, keep it. And there's nothing wrong withshowing off a good figure. I'm trying to convinceDena that she's beautiful. What do you think? She's sensational. I'd like to give a dinnerparty tomorrow night. Will you come? I don't know. It's difficult. But you must. Melissa will help me with the guest list. It'll be fun. Lesson number six-- don't turnyour back on a new experience. Hmm? Don't worry. You are beautiful. Hi. Come in. I'm glad you decided to visit. I'm not sure why I did. Come on. I'll show you a good reason. [soft dramatic music] You sent me a note. Well, what do you want from me? I was asked to place myfacilities at your disposal. Will you stay? Or will you go? I should like to stay. There's only one condition-- I insist on being paid. MELISSA: That's the name of the game, darling. I can easily arrange appointments for you. But this is not making it withyour husband or boyfriend. This is a purely commercial transaction. He pays-- you put out. And there's no drawing lines either. Whatever he wants, you do. And you make him feelgood while he's doing it. You'll be in there toguarantee total satisfaction. I don't want my house gettinga reputation for bad trips. Profit through pleasure by giving pleasure-- that's the motto of a successful whore. [soft dramatic music] [clock chimes] [whispering] [whispering] [music playing] [humming] I'm going to blindfold you. Then one of the men here presentis going to make love to you. Without this, your educationwon't be complete-- unless you want to call thewhole thing off and go home? Good, because you arefree to leave if you wish. Afterwards, you have to guess which one it was. And to add a littlespice to your initiation, if you point the finger at the wrong man, then he will have the rightto demand a penance from you. Do you understand? But, Suzy, you don't really mean it. If you love me, you'll do it. Clear the table, would you. Gentlemen. Don't worry. I'll be holding your hand the whole time. [soft dramatic music] Melissa has explained to you what I want? Then, begin. Something else. Mm, another one. Another one. Change again. Too young. Turn around. Stop. It's just beautiful. This one's perfect. Oh. [shudders] Just what I want. Oh. [moans softly] Oh, I love it. Oh! MAN: Now, come here. [clock ticking] [soft romantic music] [EXASPERATED] That's all of them. Not quite all, Dena. Remember, I said, all the men in the room? Well, he was in the dining room, darling. And there's no doubt he's a man, is there? She's all yours, gentlemen. [soft romantic music] Well, how did T. Ross react? What did you expect? She just turned around and left. Oh, she loved it. Why are you making a whore out of her? Don't be silly. I'm encouraging her fantasy. Hers? Or yours? Mine? I don't have any. Oh, it's crazy. I start these things. I never expect she'll go through with them. And I-- she always does. Why? You really don't know? Mm-mm. Then it's time you learned. Where are we going? You'll find out. Will I see you again? I mean, here? I thought we agreed-- no questions. I went to see you. I must. Just tell me when. No. I'll find you. Yes, it's more exciting. You'll just have to find me. [chatter] [gong] Melissa, darling! How lovely of you to come. It's so wonderful to see you. Oh my. Who's this with the plunging neckline? Love it. You must introduce us, Melissa. I don't think we've met. Suzy, meet Yolanda. Suzy? Oh, I just love it. Listen, Suzy, why don't you take this card and write your name, OK, cara? Hey, everybody! Look who's here-- Melissa. [chatter] Suzy, I love that name. Hey, just a minute. What's that about? It's a game called Mate Me-- two names drawn out of there go together. If you think that I-- It's one harmless little game. Yeah? Well, I don't press my luck with anybody. You should. It makes a change frommanipulating young girls. It's no fun if I don't call the tune. Hey, where are they going? Let's follow them and find out. [disco music] MAN: I'll be on my way back to the states. [interposing voices] Goodbye, Melissa. Where are you going? I got to move. I don't need all this. [MUSIC - CHEMISE, "SHE CAN'T LOVE YOU"] [SINGING] Oh, yeah, saw you last night. Mm-hmm. I was in the club, yeah. Saw who you were with too. When I saw you last night, I could easily see she was holding you so tight'cause she knows you want me. Oh, no, 'cause she can't love you. She can't love you like I can. She can't love you. She can't love you like I can. I said to myself that must be on your mind. You were there with someone else. But you know you're wasting your time. Oh, no, 'cause she can't love you. Uh-uh, no, no. She can't love you like I can. You know it too. She can't love you. Nobody's ever manhandledme like that before. The dominant male, wow. I loved it. To think I wanted to shock you. And I spoiled it for you. No, you made it perfect. And how do you feel now? Oh, I feel reborn. It's-- are you shocked? No. I told you-- I only like girls who know what they're doing. Did I excite you? You know, I never knew till now what my own reactions would be to having to submit to someone else's will. [laughter] Your-- your father's conditionis becoming very serious. I would advise that he not be left alone again. I couldn't get a ride home. [gasping] It's not like you to neglect your father. Oh, I realize that you have your own life. But your father's is drawing to a close. Perhaps a little less selfishness on your part of the future, hmm? That's not fair. Your father is dying. That isn't fair either. It is a fact. Oh, yes. Will you just put it over there? Now, what's this about notbeing able to afford a divorce? I can afford any damn thing I want. We're residents of California. Community property-- what's yours is mine. That's about as low as any man can get. I call it equal rights. You're all for that, as I recall. Equal rights? Oh, Jeffrey, I'll have to call back. What do you want? I'm freezing. Let's go back to your house. No, Dena's got that number. But I thought she was your friend. Not really. She does everything I tell her to. She's boring. Does that sound terrible? Naughty, naughty Suzy. What's the matter? I don't like all these games you play with Dena and God knows how many others. T. Ross, I wonder what she's up to? You know, come to think of it-- Teresa Ross, she likes to play the whore. I am your whore. Make me your whore. [telephone rings] No. Don't you dare. Yes? Hello? It's your husband. [WHISPERS] Just hang up. No, it wouldn't be right. I think a husband has aright to talk to his wife if he wants to. Pig. Talk or I'll hurt you. [gasps] Hello, Jeffrey. What the hell is going on there? You said you'd call me back. Please, Jeffrey, I-- I can't talk now. My hair's wet. Are you telling me thatyou went and washed your hair instead of calling me back? TERESA [ON PHONE]: Please, Jeffrey. [ANGRY] What the hell is going on there? Please, Jeffrey. JEFFREY [ON PHONE]: Look,what I wanted to say was-- Hello. We have a crossed line. You have to hang up, please. Hang up, please. Look, I'm talking to my wife.Hello. Hello! How could you be so stupid? Did it excite you? It didn't. You'd better go. You want me to go? Yes. OK. [PANICKED] Hey, youcan't leave me like this. Wait a minute. You've got to come and untie me first. Sorry. Can't hear you with the water running. Please. You aren't really angry with me? Bastard, if you don't untie me, I-- But you might attack me. No, much better if I tellroom service to untie you. [ANGRILY] You wouldn't dare. Mm-hmm. You come back. Come back. [knock at door] No! Don't answer the door. Oh, I was expecting to see Mrs. Teresa Ross. Are you a friend of hers? Well, yes. She's right in there. Did you get rid of them? Well, did you? Who are you? My name's Suzy Randall. We have met before. Have we? Outside a bookshop-- you asked me about a glass torso. Listen, would you be a darlingand just get me out of here? Well, yes. But won't it spoil the game? The game's over. Just untie me. [telephone rings] Don't answer that. It'll be my husband again. Hello. Now, who is it this time? May I speak to T? [laughs] I'm afraid she's tied up right now. Oh, the hell with it. Listen, could you leave her a message? This is her husband. Could you tell her I'll be atthe airport tomorrow, instead of the day after, Saturday-- the flight from London, OK? OK. Had your fun? Just get me out of this. Exciting, isn't it? Who was it? Oh, uh, it was the glassworks, soliciting more orders. What do you think? I think It's none of your business. That's where you're wrong. What you don't know is that none of this would have happened if it hadn't been for me. [ANGRILY] It's none of your business. That man that just left,did you meet him at Melissa's? What do you know about Melissa? Everything. It was me who set you up there. Oh, I suppose The OrchidHouse had nothing to do with it. Not as far as I can discover--not a damn thing for any of us. Any of us? I'm in touch with another girl. I set things up for her too. Oh, yes? Well, you can just stay out of my life. Any organizing that needsto be done, I do for myself. OK? I helped you. I changed your life. So? I want you to help me. Could you go toMelissa's tomorrow night? I could. But why should I? Oh, because it will be exciting. For you? For both of us. But she must have come back by now. She doesn't want to talk to me, is that it? [knocking] Oh, please, please, ask her to call me. No, I will not disrobe. No, I will not enter the water. What I am going to do is tell you what you can do with your crummyorganization and your promises for anonymity. My name is T. Ross. You know where I'm staying. I want one of your people-- not a machine, face to face-- within the hour. Got that? Good. Failing that, I'm going tosue this electronic Disneyland right off the face of the earth. Got it? Good. Goodbye. MAN [RECORDING]: Any experience opportunities presented to you will be so shaped as to fit into your present way of life. We will be looking forwardto hearing of your progress. I'm finished with those games. I wish I could believe that. Could you stand to be rich? Hmm, well, it would be a struggle at first. But then again, it's not something that worries me too much. Why not? Simply because my chances ofwinning the national lottery are about 50 million to one. The odds would improveif you had the only ticket. What's this? Another game? Marry me. [telephone rings] Hello? Oh, Suzy, I've been trying to reach you. Oh, great. Well, listen, I've got something to tell you. Raul and I-- Oh, please, I have to see you. I have to tell you something. I have to talk to you. Well, I've got news for you. Raul and I are-- Oh, Suzy, stop it please. I have to see you. I love you. Yeah, well, listen-- oh, you're just too boring. Go to hell! Mrs. Ross? Oh, Professor Paul, please come in. Thank you. Did you hear my tape? I did. But I can't claim to understand it. Just tell me exactly what yourorganization has done for me. Absolutely nothing, Mrs. Ross. Nothing? What about the phone calls? What about Melissa's? Whatever has happened, whatever experiences you have had, wereentirely of your own making. I structured nothing, which is precisely the point of the clinic-- self-realization. So that interfering little bitch was right? I'm sorry? I-- Professor, you obviously don't know it. But someone has been structuringand very effectively. And they've cited The House of Orchids. I'm sorry if there havebeen unfortunate consequences. Please accept my assurancethat it was not my doing. Professor, you're wrong when you say your clinic did nothing. The past few days have beenthe most exciting-- the most revealing-- of my entire life. I found out quite a bit about myself. I take it that the crisisyou spoke of in the clinic is passed? Passed, dead, and forgotten. Professor, I feel like celebrating. I've just found out I'm a hell of a woman. Congratulations. I'm Jeffrey Ross. The car's outside. - You're here to meet me?- Yes, yes. Well, where's-- Prego. --my wife? [muttering] This way. I'm Jeffrey Ross. I was expecting to see my wife. SUZY: Mr. Ross, I'm Suzy Randall. Mm, terrific. Maybe you can tell me what I'm doing here. I thought that guy at the airport had been sent by my wife. What is this place? It's a house of assignation. It's a what? A place where lovers meet. Your wife knows it well. T? [laughs] Miss Iceberg of any year? You've got to be kidding. Oh, no, I'm not kidding. In a few minutes, I will beable to show you what kind of a woman your wife really is. Oh, I'd hoped you wouldn't come tonight. Oh, why is that? One last time, I said. T, as one woman to another-- it's a trap. Suzy Randall's put your husband here. He's behind the mirror. Really? What will you do? I'm not entirely sure. It's an interesting situation. [soft romantic music] Your wife hasdiscovered she enjoys sex. She's been coming to this house for nearly a week, selling her body to other men, doing things she's probably neverthought of doing with you. And nobody's forced her. She's become a whore of her own free will, not the kind of person you wantto be married to, Mr. Ross. [soft romantic music] There isn't enoughmoney in the world to part me from that lady in there. [sobbing] I'd say Raul's a lucky man. Oh, sure, just think of it-- no prospective parents-in-lawto meet, just lawyers, bankers, brokers, and accountants. Just so long as they don't think of me as some kind of gigolo. [laughs] You flatter yourself, darling. On your present performance,they couldn't rate you-- [doorbell rings] --as any kind of gigolo,which is something I think we should discuss, most urgently. Don't go, Melissa. Miss! I have something of yoursthat I wish to return. The coat? Keep it. More than that. [suspenseful music] Melissa, call for an ambulance! [ANGRILY] This is where your stupid games lead. You're mad-- psychotic! Let's get her to the hospital. [music playing] [SINGING] [french] He said to me, I'll show you a world just made of love for you and me. [french] I found something new-- a shining light into your eyes. And then he came to me like a soft melody. He gives me silently andbrings me through his dream. [singing in french] away from me. [french] He said to me, I'll show youa world just made of love--
