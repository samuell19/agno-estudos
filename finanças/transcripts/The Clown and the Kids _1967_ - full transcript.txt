It'll take you a good half-hour and you still have some studying to do. Come on, Flame. Want some company, Mike? Come in, Joe. Well, I see you've been packing. It means you must have told Shawn. I only told him we were quitting. How'd he take it? You know how kids are. Glad to do something new. What's newer than a long trip? Then you didn't tell him why you're quitting? My heart? No, there's plenty of time. I'll miss you and the kid. [groans] The pills... suitcase... pocket. Thanks, Joe. That was nitroglycerin. Works real fast. Just slip it under the tongue. Mike, Mike, you can't make this trip. You're a sick man. You ought to be in the hospital right now. I can't spare the time. Well, suppose you don't make it? I got to get Shawn there. Where's this place you're taking him? Angela's School for Boys in Darwin, Texas. Darwin? Why, that's over a thousand miles. About 1200 miles. I'll make it. You're sure they have room? I've already written them. They'll take him, same as they once took me. They'll do for Shawn what I can't. Oh, it'll be good to see Michael again. We'll nurse him back to health. This trip, Mother... won't it be too strenuous for him? Oh, but I know Michael, he'll manage. Now, the boy... We'll put him with the ten-year-old boys in Ward Four. Very good. And, uh, let's see... Mrs. Logan's ranch, just right for Michael and the horse. The horse? Yes, they're a carnival team. Michael, known as Moko the Clown, and his son, Shawn, rides a horse in a circus act.

You were gonna tell me how bad sick you are? And I will. I'll tell you the truth for the truth is most precious of all blessings. Always remember that, Shawn. When we were playing Daley's Carnival, I had a lot of pain in my chest. You didn't tell me. I couldn't tell you until I knew what it was myself. And you know now? Three different doctors told me the same thing. I have a bad heart. Very bad. Are you gonna... Yes, son... I'm gonna die. [crying] Pop. Now, now. It's all right, Shawn. You mustn't be afraid.

How am I gonna take care of him? Where will we go? Now, now, now... Easy. It's all settled. You'll go to live at the Angela School for Boys in Darwin. That's where I lived when I was a boy like you. You?Sure. I was an orphan too. Remember I told you about that a long time ago when you asked about your Grandma and Grandpa. Will it be your home too? Sure, we'll live together just as we always did for as long as possible. And Flame too? Of course, Flame too. They got a big field for him, a regular Texas ranch. And say, won't those other kids have a time when you and Flame put on your act for 'em? Now, Shawn, you got to promise me you won't cry. I'll try my best. The only reason I'm telling you all this now is so it won't be too much of a shock to you when the time comes. What do you mean? It could happen to me anytime, son. You mean even before we get to Darwin? This is what I want you to do in case it happens, you get on Flame and you ride to the nearest city and you ask the policemen to direct you to the nuns in that town and you tell 'em what happened.

Barker, you've been after Garvin since he broke out of Fort Worth? No, before that.Before? Yeah, I arrested him when he killed his stepfather in Dallas. Sounds like a rough customer. You have much trouble taking him? No, no trouble. I almost think he wanted to get caught. He doesn't sound like the type of guy who'd try to break out of the pen? I think he's exactly the kind that would want to get out. You see Garvin didn't consider himself guilty of anything. He claims he killed his stepfather to keep the old man from killing Garvin's mother. Only once Garvin went to trial, he couldn't prove it. You, uh, think he was guilty? Well, I only get paid to bring them in. [laughs] You know the difference between a trapped rat and a guy like Garvin? A rat can't think or feel very well. Garvin's feeling plenty. Mostly he's hating our guts. He has to. He has to keep thinking every minute how we're going to try and box him in. Barker... you sound like a bad case of conscience.

Has he been sick? Pop's been awful sick... in the heart. Well, what was he doing dragging a kid around the country for? He should have left you with your mother. He should have stayed home too. My mother's dead and he wasn't dragging me around. He was taking me to Darwin so that Mother Superior could raise me like she raised him. Mother Superior?

Could I have some of that food? Like I said before, I haven't eaten in a couple of days. I guess so. Help yourself. Thanks. Say... Shawn, have you got a blanket? We use sleeping bags. But there's an extra blanket in Flame's trailer. I'll get it if you're cold. It's, uh, not for me. Here's the blanket. Yeah. It was awful nice of you. Thanks a lot. Forget it. I guess I'll go eat.

You could get a job someplace. Well, I, uh, I've been hitchhiking to, uh... maybe a job will come up soon. You don't even have any other clothes. I, uh, sold my good clothes to get eating money. Gee... You could wear my Pop's best suit. He won't be needing it anymore. Shawn. Yes, he will... when we-- when you put him in his final resting place. I almost forgot.

Yeah, but when he told you that, there were a couple of things that he didn't count on. Like what? Well, for one thing, he didn't expect it to be in the middle of the night. Another he didn't figure I'd be here. You? Yeah, me-- I can help you. I'm a pretty good driver. I'll drive you all the way to Darwin. Get you there fast too. You shouldn't bother the good sisters. They got a lot to do. They got orphans and people like that to take care of. If you bother the good sisters, that means that somebody else, well, maybe they won't get the same kind of treatment. You understand? I guess so. But what about Pop? What are we gonna do about him? I'll help you with him too. How? I'll figure out something by morning. Hey, speaking of morning, you better get some sleep. I don't think your father'd want you to be up this late even for him. I guess I am a little sleepy. Good night, Pop. Think you'd better hop into bed. Good night, Flame. Good night, Mr. Stanton. Good night, Shawn. Pleasant dreams to both of us. Ah, it would take a whole posse a couple of weeks to flush Garvin out of country like this. Yeah, by the time he was found, he'd be dead of starvation. I don't think he's anywhere near here. What makes you think so? Well, we know he was able to swipe that outfit that he's wearing from a truck driver. Now he might just have been as smart enough to have hitched another ride. Mmm. Well, that warning against hitchhikers has been on the radio steady since yesterday morning. Yeah, but there are a lot of farmers that don't have radios in their trucks. Yeah. Oh, relax. It's a fine morning and it's a cinch we're enjoying it more than Garvin is.

Must we call each other "Mister"? I mean Pete? What's on your mind? Are you sure it's better for Pop to be buried here than in a regular cemetery? I mean, maybe the Mother Superior wouldn't like it. No priest or nothing, just buried in the woods. Your father would like this place, Shawn. He's probably the kind of man who was always close to nature. You talk like you knew him.

Well, I'm not like him. I never was. You understand what I'm trying to tell you? I don't get you. Maybe I don't understand myself. Remember one thing, for everyone there's a day of reckoning. For everyone in the world. I only hope when mine comes, it'll be tougher on me than it is on you. [car approaching] Flame will be getting hungry. Why don't you go feed him? Thanks, Pete. So now you know the truth. That's why I didn't want you to see me without my makeup. Sure, sure, I'm James Garvin. I'm a convicted murderer. The police are looking for me all over the county. Pete! Kid. You didn't hear-- Pete, you couldn't kill anybody. Well, sometimes you can if you have to. I wanted to go to Mexico. Couldn't even do that right. I'm going to give myself up to Barker. First my real Pop, now you. Kid, listen! I'm not gonna listen to you. I'm not gonna listen to any of you. Shawn, wait! I wanted to be gone before he learned the truth. Pete, you better leave him alone! No, I'm gonna go see where he's going. Shawn! Wait-- Wait! Wait! Let go! I'm not staying here! I'm not staying here! Down, Flame-- down! [horse snorting] Kid, you shouldn't have tried it. You can't run away from things, kid. You can't run away from things, believe me. Things would have worked out. They-- Hello, Garvin. You better get a doctor for the kid. I can wait. Hello, Pete. Hello, son. I just talked to the doctor. You got a pretty bad bump. But you're gonna be as good as new in a couple days. Did Flame run away? You think he'd go anywhere without you? Pete, don't go away. Okay. I'll wait as long as I can. Then Garvin's stepfather grabbed the gun and was about to shoot his wife, Garvin's mother. But Garvin grabbed him, they struggled for the gun, it went off and the stepfather was killed. That was Garvin's story but it didn't sound so good to the jury. But it did to you. Well, I guess I was closer to the whole thing than anybody else. You know something, Mother... ... a policeman is just another guy but with a badge, a human being. He's got eyes, a nose, a mouth, feet, hands, and most of the times, he's got a heart. He has his own opinions and feelings about everything just like everybody else. Sometimes he doesn't want to have feelings. Sometimes it's better if he doesn't. Well, you know what I mean. I know. Well, seeing as how I was responsible for Garvin being in jail and seeing as how I didn't think he was guilty of anything, I knew I had to do something about it. It was getting tough to sleep nights. So... I asked my pal in homicide over in Dallas to help me run the case down a little more. Well, while I was chasing Garvin all over Texas, he really ran down the case. He sent me all the information just before I came here. Now I'm willing to bet ten bucks that with this new evidence, the Governor will be convinced that Garvin should have a full pardon. Won't the fact that he escaped from prison count against him? Well, normally it would, but he's still an innocent man and the way he took care of the boy proves that he's a good citizen. No, I wouldn't be afraid to go to bat for him all the way. Thank you. He's asleep. Well, I'm ready. Well, if you want to say goodbye to anybody, it's okay with me. Mother, shall we go ahead? We'll walk forward. That's always the best way to go. I wonder what it would have been like in Mexico? ♪♪ ♪♪
