Mahmoud! Get up now! Uncle's coming soon. Hello, boss. Thank you. Say hello to your dad from me. Summer vacation. Great for ethnic Norwegians, but word, it sucks for us broke foreigners. They've got mountain cabins, seaside cabins, mainland cabins, skerry cabins. They drive two sec from Oslo to park their pink asses on shitholes scary as fuck. Norwegians in Norway sit bare-assed, reading comics and checking the weather. Bro, dad didn't go by train and container to Norway to shit outdoors! - Right. - The thing is: After a holiday in Pakistan you feel like a Marvel hero. I'm not kidding! You survived all that! The dogs here eat better than most humans. They need dentists and get diabetes. But the fucking dogs in Pakistan... Down there, the dogs eat dirt and crap and carcasses. One of the bastard mutts jetted after me. I'd had chili curry, and got the trotters. He was starving. Everything was food. Luckily Pakistani aunts are the best. Like, real family. For life. Not like in Norway, where families last five minutes. After that I ate loads of naan to get constipated. Take care of your tummy. Word, man. The moment we touched down... I blasted that loo like it was World War III. Three weeks of crap - in one go. Poor ethnic Norwegian. Now he's got a hate group on Facebook: "Help! They're taking over our country!" He writes muck about foreigners. While eating kebab?! Mild, no onion, extra corn. Bro, most of us are stuffed with chili, kebab and soft drinks. Are we gonna fart our way to power? Oi! Mahmoud! Finding yourself again? Stop philosophising and get up here! - Move it! - I've tidied up! Have you seen what your room looks like? Come on, move it! Mahmoud! I see everything. Don't even think about it! Tidy up! - Okay, fine! - And show some respect, Mahmoud! - You have to tidy up, Ali. - Can you help me, bro? Dad didn't come to Norway for his youngest son to get hooked on pink horses either. What did I say about rainbow unicorns? The log doesn't lie, Ali. Why do you never do what I say? Mom collects sandals. She smacks us with them when we don't listen to her. It's tradition where she's from. - You expect your mother to tidy up here? - I've tidied up, mom! Look! But someone seems to have dropped a dollar-store bomb on Ali's half. Don't be cheeky! Help your brother! That's life for Paki kids. Think about it, Norwegian kids, when you don't get the latest iPhone the day it's launched. Have you seen my phone? Ali! - What are you doing?! - Sorry! Dammit, Ali. Get a grip, bro. - So what's up? - Nothing. Mahmoud has to tidy the room, or mom will smack him. - Good luck with that. - Good luck with this... kickass thing. See you, Ali. Bye. - You look weird, bro. - Shut up. Go tidy the room. - You look weird, bro. - Shut up. Go tidy the room. Hey, relax. Freaking Kurds. They're all called Goran. My day-one, Arif, has only one eye. - Arif! - His mom went mental, ninja style. Instead of comforting him, she said, "It's okay, Arif. I still have eight children who can see." "In Norway, the welfare office helps the blind." "If you go blind, get disability benefits so your dad and I can afford another kid." But that's not the weirdest thing about Arif. Just wait. Here it comes. I'm pretty sure nothing of this is real. Get it? We don't exist. Nothing exists. Okay, bro. But what's happening? If nothing exists, then nothing's happening, like. - And you? - I walked down the stairs with Arisha. - Or behind her. - Behind's behind. - But hey, applied for a summer job yet? - Think Mahmoud Marof can find work? - Wrong name. - I've applied. But your name isn't Preben, Aksel or Noah. - How many names do you have? 17? - I think it's eight. Arif Abdul Bin Hassan Ul Darrori Husne Kitaaba Khusri. Nine. Nine names. Oi, Mahmoud! Four full milk, three wholemeal bread and kefir. Move it! Two large Pepsi Max and one Sprite. Your uncle only drinks Sprite. Don't forget it! And bullet chili! Your dad shits blood if I use regular. I mix it with yoghurt. So I don't have to wash undies all day. Still got problems, Zubaida? Did you get Mahmoud to rub his butt with mustard oil? I put my husband on a stone I heat in the oven. Then I feed him grass. It's like the UN, bro. But it's not about poverty, hunger and global heating. It's about my dad's bunghole. His ass has cost me every ounce of self-respect I've scraped together through 13 long years. Mahmoud, watch out! Look at those morons! LAST CHEAP BREAD! Dammit. I didn't come here to eat overpriced bread! No, let's eat cheap bread and shit blood. Oh my days... People in Pakistan think everyone in Norway's loaded. But we skimp on everything. It's super-important for dad to serve his brother only the best. Mom has to hang in there 24/7 to avoid a scandal in the old country. They're coming! Hurry! Uncle will be wearing his shalwar kameez and look like the most corrupt Pakistani politician ever. - What did I tell you? - Hello, Zubaida. - Hello, brother. - It's been ages. Did you have a pleasant journey? You have no idea. There's some bad blood and unmentionable caste stuff going on. And I promise it'll screw up my entire summer, man. - Mahmoud! - Greetings. Hello, my boy. And this? Is it really Ali? He certainly has grown! Eat? Samosas, deep-fried so they're super crispy outside and soft on the inside. Delicious chicken karahi. Raita, with proper thick yoghurt. She's even made real saffron rice! - Zubaida, you always make food this good? - Always. - Zubaida makes delicious food. - Wonderful! Wow! Wow! - Wow! - Ali? Ali? If you burp in Pakistan, it means the food is great. - It's a huge compliment. - Hey, Shahbaz? Does driving a taxi here pay well? - We get by. It's only temporary. - Temporary? - I see. - Mom cleans at school. It really helps if the wife also has a job. I was supposed to have summer vacation now, but... Women get summer vacation as well? I must say. - These are from auntie. - Thank you. - Shahbaz! - Sandal. A lota. Aluminium. Whites hoard toilet rolls. Dad uses a lota. It's got the perfect spout! - Just the right size. - Mahmoud, for you. Nice shirt, huh? - "Armani", mom. - No, Ermani is spelled with an E. Number one in Pakistan. Comes from America. - Thanks, Uncle Ji. - Do I get a unicorn pencil box? - What did he say? - He asks if you have anything for him. Of course I do, my boy. Here you go. - Thank you, Uncle Ji! - Here, Shahbaz. Cigarettes. - By the way... - He quit smoking two years ago. Keep your gifts. - It belonged to mother. - She'll come around. It's been ages. You never call. - Mom and dad would have appreciated it. - You're here now. True enough. I brought something else too. Check it out. - Maula Jatt! - Remember? Sultan Rahi. Oh, jeez. He's huge in Pakistan. He was brutal, bro. Only played in gory action movies. He's Pakistan's Chuck Norris, Lars Monsen and Zlatan. Hey, man. Check out Mukkho. God almighty. Poor Mahmoud. You should've had a daughter. It's not too late. What do you think? Ali, what did I tell you about that unicorn stuff? You're too old! Let Ali watch what he likes. Zubaida! Have you got biscuits for the tea? And more mango! - I don't want anything from him. Get it? - Okay, fine! What do I care? Don't take that tone with me. Understood? Paki kids are slaves to their parents. I came to Norway to give you a better life, so you owe me a massage. Thank God that Mahmoud is such a dutiful son, Shahbaz. Mahmoud? I have to work this summer. Mom has to cook. Someone has to take care of Uncle Ji. It'll have to be you. Here we go. My summer, already fucked up by milk, more milk, soft drinks, cheap bread, more fucking milk, just became 1000 % more fucked up. My life is ruined. I'm not Norwegian. Not Pakistani. What the hell am I? What am I doing by this stupid lake? Norwegian values, Mahmoud. Norwegian values... Mahmoud! Get up! I've had it! - Get that idiot out of here! - Mom! Mahmoud! Put this on. Come on, let's go! - Nice T-shirt, Mahmoud. Real Ermani? - Shut up. Ermani! Everything's so beautiful! Is there never war here? No, Uncle Ji. Hardly ever. Uncle Ji thinks he's in heaven. He doesn't know this is the East Side, full of blacks Uncle Ji thinks he's in heaven. He doesn't know this is the East Side, full of blacks and high-rises Norwegians won't live in. Everything's so clean! Do they even wash the tarmac? Sure, every year. Look at that! - Take it easy. - But hey... How can the dead rest in peace with all this going on above them? Hi! - Stop it! - It's okay. Oh my gosh. Two months in Norway is far from enough, Mahmoud! Come on! Freedom! Norway! What's that in your eye? Show me what you have behind your back. Ali, show me! - It's nothing. - It's something. Show it to me. Is that Arisha's? You thieving runt! Did you take anything else? You know you have to give it back? God will be mad at you. At least Arisha will. - But it's so pretty. - Ali, you're a boy! - Hello. - Hi. Arisha? Say hello to your dad from me. Bye. - Hello. - Hi. Come on, Ali. Give it up. - Here. - Wow! There they are. - It's okay. I've got lots of makeup. - Sorry. - You can have it. - Thanks a lot! You're the best! - May I come inside, Arisha? - Yeah, sure thing. Hey, I checked my email yesterday. Five fucking rejections. I handle all mom's digital ID stuff. - So I logged in and changed my name. - To what? - Noah. - Noah? Awesome, man. Rad! - So you're gonna apply again? - Once I've charged. Just need to up my percentage. Go ahead and laugh. I'm a fucking illuminati, man! Who is it? Ali? It's dinnertime. Come on! One moment. What's he wearing? What's going on? Seriously, what's going on? - Fine, Ali. We're going home. Take it off. - I've outgrown it. - It looks nicer on Alia. - "Alia"? - It looks nicer on Alia. - "Alia"? - Ali, listen... - Alia! - Hey, stop hanging with my brother. - It's just a game, Mahmoud. Aren't you going to eat, Ali? It's just a phase, Shahbaz. Hey, what's he doing with Arisha all day? - I don't know. - Why don't you look after him? Look after him? Sure, I can look after Uncle Ji, Ali, Arisha. Let me know if you want me to look after anyone else. Zubaida? Do you have any sweets? Ice cream or something? - Mahmoud? - Yeah? - What are they fighting about? - The old days. What do you mean, "old days"? Uncle Ji and dad's relatives didn't want mom and dad to get married. - Why not? - How should I know, Ali? Luckily they did. Yeah, luckily. Bro? Bro? Are you really sure God loves all people? - Yes, Ali. - Then why did God make me like this? Like what? - Like I don't fit in. - You fit in. You're an East Side Paki just like everyone else. Hey, Mahmoud? What's that? - What do you mean? It's a baby. - But... I explain that in Norway, men push baby carriages and everything. Then I tell him that women here get ten months maternity leave, and men get fifteen weeks paternity leave too. You get paid to have kids?! Uncle Ji, are you okay? I wanna live here, Mahmoud. One, two, three... Why should three Pakis go see Munch paintings? Entrance fee: NOK 160. Easy savings. Wow! One more time! - What do you do for a living, uncle? - He asks where you work. I work in a factory that produces leather goods. Import, export, medical equipment, riding articles like straps and so on. Everything is sent to Europe. This is a horse strap. Bro, that's not riding equipment! Word, Uncle Ji has no idea what he's making. Everyone who's seen the Internet knows whites love to be whipped when they fuck. Why are you laughing? It's my job, chum! After the Second World War, they executed the traitors down here. - The place is haunted at night. - Haunted? God save us! Sometimes I feel like an Oslonian. It should've been a separate nationality. If anyone asked, I'd say, "I'm from Oslo." "I'm Oslonian." Identity crisis? Done, bro. Listen up, boys. I've found some girls for you. Look, Mahmoud. This is Rizwana. Ripe for marriage. - Look at that basket! Isn't it nice? - What do I need a basket for? Come on, Mahmoud. Wake up. Real Pakistani girls beat girls raised in Norway. And here's one for you, Ali. Neelam! And here's one for you, Ali. Neelam! We haven't agreed yet, but with some negotiation... - Show us a picture of your wife, uncle. - Uncle Ji isn't married. Why not? He wants to know why you're not married. It's kinda hard to explain. I guess it's fate. I don't know. You look like the cheapest made in China Disney princess you can get on Ali Baba for only nine kroner, man! - Did Arisha say anything about me? - No. Did she say anything about me she told you not to tell me? You sure? Arisha said I could come back whenever I want. Mahmoud? - What? - Your crazy uncle refuses to get up. Uncle Ji? What's the matter? Hello, Uncle Ji? Can I become a refugee? I'll say I can't return to Pakistan because they'll kill me. They don't let Pakistanis in anymore. We can't integrate. I can integrate. I can be Norwegian. Listen! "Tusen takk. Absolutt." There, I'm Norwegian! Look here. This woman thinks all Norwegians need to have a house, a car, a boat and a second home in Spain before they can help anyone else. Sylvi? She looks nice. Is she married? You won't like it here. It's dark in winter. People stop talking and break their legs. No more nude women. Dammit. You mean... there's nothing we can do? Making friends with mom would be a start. Right. - You're our guest. You don't have to help. - It's okay. No problem. What's going on? - Put it there. - Let me do it. Is he gonna say I don't look after him? - It's okay, I... - Is he going to steal our deposit? - Don't you dare enter my kitchen! - Relax! Chill! - Give me back the bottle! It's ours! - What are you doing? Let me help! You see what I'm going through? I know exactly what other Norwegian kids do all summer. Oi! Mahmoud! Finding yourself again? Go get the groceries! What's up, Noah? Hey, you're smart. What happens at a job interview? - Jack Sparrow landed an interview? - Soon. Tell me. Sell me this pen. You don't want this pen. There's no hole on top. More than a hundred people die every year choking on these things. So the manufacturers have started making a hole in the cap. Buy this one - or die. Buy this one - or die. Wow, bro! You sold me the pen! - Here you go. - Mahmoud? May I have a pink cake? Please? - Hope you like it. - Thank you so much! Are they men?! Wait. Where's Ali? - Freddie Mercury. - What? Ali! What are you doing? Oh! As soon as summer comes, Norwegians start to take off their clothes. May God forgive them. Some remove all of them. May God have mercy on them. My brothers. Do not forget your faith. - Protect it. - Oh gosh. Look the other way. May God forgive me. Uncle Ji? Why are you up so early? - I can't sleep. - Oh? Why not? - Women. - What women? All of them. Don't turn to look, Uncle Ji. - Hello. - Hi there. - Good. - Do you know her? No, you say hi in the woods here. - And don't stare at their asses. - What are we doing here? - What Norwegians do. - Okay, like...? Walk in circles around lakes in the forest? And think about life. And how they can cut down on sugar. Or how they can land a new job. And when they get tired... They treat themselves to a Kvikk Lunsj. - Sylvi too? - Guaranteed. Fucking Sylvi! Hey, Mahmoud. What's with this bike? - It's a rental. - Ok. Let's go. I don't know what these people talk about, but it's not what ethnic Norwegians think. It's very, very nice. But guys... Don't you think we should get around to taking over Norway? No, Somalis want nice blazers and legalized khat. Palestinians want to smoke. Iranians want to sit on benches. Turks want to drink tea and watch Galatasaray vs Fenerbahce in their clubs. How are we gonna take over? All we do is chill. - How much for an ice cream, Shahbaz? - It's 27 kroner. - How much for an ice cream, Shahbaz? - It's 27 kroner. 27?! - Is everything in Oslo this pricey? - Yeah. So eat it slowly. There's no rush. Ten taps for you. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. "The thieves tied up their horses," "took their saddlebags and approached the cliff wall." "Their chieftain stopped and shouted so loudly Ali Baba could hear every word." "'Open sesame!' No sooner had he said..." Alia Baba? Alia is for real, Mahmoud. "As soon as he spoke the words, the cliff wall opened, and they all went inside." Ali. - Bro, I'm a girl. - Huh?! I look like a boy, but I'm a girl. You're not a girl just cause you hang with Arisha. Mahmoud, you're so stupid. You don't get it. You think I'm a gay Paki. But Arisha gets it. I don't get everything, okay? But I've got your back, bro. Always. Do you have to say "bro" all the time? Shoot me with a shotgun in the face, bro. I've had it with my family sometimes. - Ali's freaking me out, man. - Ali's cute. No, bro. Ali's... He says he's a chick, and... - What? - I don't know anymore, man. He keeps giving mom compliments. Loves pink. Uses nail polish. I don't know. - Ali has to be who he likes. - Why do you say that? I've got an eye in my head, bro. But bro? This is between us, okay? Born in the wrong body - I was born in the wrong body. - Woman? - I'm comfortable with trans. - I wasn't born in the wrong body. It's stunningly wonderful! Trans kids I used to be a boy. Now my name is Emma. First Emma got puberty blockers, then female hormones. When she turns 18, she can finally get her operation. It'll be fine. Almost like you're born with a vagina. But you don't get periods. The most important thing is to let kids be themselves. It would've been easier if Ali's name was Kristian Frederik, and we lived on the West Side with white parents. We'd have attended a transgender course, started a podcast, posted on insta... But dad... Shit, I don't know. First he'd go mental for real and get suicidally depressed. I didn't come to Norway for my son to become a daughter! Besides... Right now I'm seriously confused. - Hi there! - Hey, it's Ali. - Mahmoud's younger brother. - What's with the outfit? Why are you wearing a dress? - What's up? - You a girl now? Hi there! - Hi! - Hi. What have you told Ali? - He's a girl? Born in the wrong body? - Nothing. - Where did he get the idea? He's nine! - You know what? You don't get it. You don't know shit, okay? Just back off. Stay away from Ali! - Go radicalise someone else. - I pity Ali who has you as his brother. Yeah, just jog off. Jet the hell outa here. Look at that! She likes you. - You don't have a clue, uncle. - Mahmoud! - Mahmoud! - Leave me alone. Oi, Mahmoud! We met your bro. Nice outfit! He's got some twisted stuff going on. - He says he's a pussy! - You wanna hear about twisted? You wet yourself every evening and wear diapers at night. What did you say? This wannabe gangster bitch can't help wetting himself every night. His mom whops him every damn evening. I can hear you whining. She's sick of doing the laundry. The whole high-rise vibrates cause of your bladder. So instead of pissing on my little brother, stop wetting your bed. Mahmoud! - Motherfuckers! - Let's get outa here. Scram! Get up. Get up. Are you okay? Get it now? Leave! Fuck off! Come on, boys. Come. What's happened? What are you wearing?! What happened? Nothing. He got in a fight. It's okay. Ali? Go upstairs and change. Dad will be home soon. Hold this here. - Ouch. - Just a tiny... Ali says he's a girl. What? I always knew there was something wrong with Ali. There's nothing wrong with him, mom. Why hasn't he said anything to me? He likes my clothes, my jewellery. I thought it was just a phase. That whatever it was, it would pass. - Am I a bad mother, Mahmoud? - No, you're the world's best mom. Okay, not the world's best. But pretty good. - I can't smell anything. - What is it, uncle? What are you doing? Stop that superstitious nonsense! - If it's a djinn, I'll get it out. - There are no evil spirits here! - Calm down, Zubaida! - Get rid of that thing! - What'll they say back home? - This is my house. Stop pushing me around. You just do as you please! I'm spending my vacation as your servant! It's your duty! I'm your brother-in-law! Show some respect! Cut it out, both of you! That's enough! What's going on here? Huh? - Did someone beat you up? - Uh... Mom threw a bag with some cash from the balcony. Goran tried to grab it, and we started fighting. Mahmoud whipped his butt. It was almost over when I arrived. I'm glad you're speaking Urdu to me, Mahmoud. Spending time with family helps. And you two... I spend the whole day driving a cab to make money. For all of us. I need food and massage. Not chaos. - Shahbaz? - Mm? What is it? Why did you choose to marry me? You were... Different. I fought for you. Every evening. I came to you in the garden. Different. Keep that in mind, Shahbaz. Mahmoud? Don't just stand there. I've made paratha with omelette. OMG! So tasty it's sick, man. Paratha is roti with loads of butter, egg and pepper. Paratha is roti with loads of butter, egg and pepper. Word, when the food bloggers discover paratha, they'll go bananas. As long as everyone has their mouth full, there won't be chaos. Do you think I've been working too much lately? Have I been a lousy brother? Father? And husband too? I'll take time off from the cab, and we can go to Verdens Ende. - Where? - End of the World! End of the World? What's that supposed to mean? The real end? Not the actual end, that's just the name. No, why would we want to go there? No thanks. - Tusenfryd? - Do I look like a billionaire? - Sognsvann! - Again? We always go there. - Only white folks go there. - Picnic! By the seaside! Ludicrous. Pakis on a day trip. See whatever you went to see. Picnic on a parking lot or something. Drive back. No shell pants, primus or bird dog here. Come on, dad. Put on something cool. Surprise us! "I'll kiss the ground you walk upon" "if you let me come close to you." "The love song is beautiful..." Wait! Look, the sun's coming out! - I'll head down to the water. - See you down there. - Fantastic! - Uncle loves water. Yes, that's right. - Ali, be careful! - Sure. I thought we were supposed to be together. We are together, Shahbaz. Come with me. Come here. You're mad! You're messing up our kids! I wanna be a girl! - Shahbaz, wait! - I'm a girl! Come down here at once! - I wanna be a girl! - Stop saying that! You're a boy! A boy! Come here, now! You're a boy, you hear me?! I'm a girl! What's happened? Mom told dad about Ali. But Mahmoud... - Ali isn't a girl. - Nah... But I don't know. When the chili refused to burn properly, I knew there was something wrong. - Mahmoud? Is Ali a hijra? - Uh... What's a hijra? Neither man nor woman. Hijras are sacred. They can bless or curse. They are fascinating things. Hijras are sacred. They can bless or curse. They are fascinating things. - Ali isn't a thing. - You're right. - Shahbaz? - That's enough! Some families don't know what pleasant means. - That's enough, I said! - All they know is chaos. Here I am, working myself to death to put food on the table. - This one goes out, this one and this one! - Are you crazy? - What is this? - Why are you doing this? Shahbaz, stop it! - You've let him run wild! - And you've lost your mind! I should've put my foot down ages ago! Are you completely insane? - Ali's our child! - He can't possibly be my kid! Out! Out! I don't want you here! Leave, or I'll take the kids and... Come on, brother. We can't stay here. Yeah, you can leave too. I know you'll squeal to your crazy relatives. I'm not afraid of anyone! I work myself to death to give that boy a good life. - He's just a child. - That's right. Just a child. He doesn't know what's right. Imagine if we'd told people back home we were girls? It would be a disaster. - Don't say a word about this in Pakistan. - I won't. I work all the time. Didn't even notice. But this ends here. Tomorrow morning we'll set Ali straight. This is all Zubaida's fault. We should've married the sisters dad found for us. If I'd listened to him, none of this would have happened. Shahbaz? Are you asleep? Zubaida? I need to speak with you. Zubaida, I... I... Thank you. I bet you're pleased now. - What happened? - The taxi was so cold. - What do you mean? - Well... Zubaida, let me in. Open the door. What are you doing here? Zubaida is right, Shahbaz. Who do you think you are? My son won't be a hijra who dances at weddings and sits begging by the roadside. - But Shahbaz, Ali will stay here with you. - Nonsense! Let me in! Mahmoud? Don't I deserve to use my own toilet? Mahmoud? Don't I deserve to use my own toilet? You're making a fool of yourself. Get a grip. Zubaida? Can you give me my lota too? You want me to give him this? - Take it and leave. - What's this?! Goodbye, Shahbaz. Arif here. I'm real busy. Leave a message. Beep. Put it here. Do you like it? Ali? Aren't you hungry? Okay, bro. Take care. - When will you stop messing with my life? - It's my duty to look after you, Shahbaz. You can't even take care of yourself. How are you supposed to look after me? "Give me this, give me that! Shahbaz, give me some money!" You're just a freeloader. You've got no wife, no kids. - That's enough, Shahbaz. - You'll be alone all your life. Have you lost your mind? Huh?! No, you have to hold my hand! You don't know what you've got, bro. Know what it's like to be alone? Every day I go to the factory. Then I go home, eat, sleep, and return to the factory. That's all. My life is an empty shell. If a child is a boy, how can it suddenly turn into a girl? All day... All day you sit in the cab. You can't catch everything. Go home, Shahbaz. - I'll walk home through the forest. - The forest? In this country people go for walks around lakes. You should try it. In this country people go for walks around lakes. You should try it. It's very relaxing. Daddy's coming! Dad? Ali needs help! - Is it that fucking hard to get? - Firstly: We don't swear, Mahmoud. Daddy! Ali? It's for you, daddy! Ali! Ali! Careful! - Catch! - Ali! Take all of it! - Ali! - I don't want it! Zubaida! Ali! - Ali! - What's happened, Mahmoud? Mahmoud? What's wrong? - I can't find Ali. - What? Ali! Ali? Mahmoud? Ali! What have you done? What's going on? Are you alright, darling? Are you okay? - I want to throw it all away. - Ali's confused. It will pass, with God's help. - You're confused! - You've made him a girl! You're crazy. Talking rubbish. Shut up, Shahbaz! Shut your mouth and keep it shut! All your life you've made shitty plans. None of them have ever come to anything! You've never seen your children. Never given them any of your time. If I ever hear this crap from you again, I'll take the kids to the crisis centre. You can sit there in your goddamn taxi and scratch your balls! If you live your life to please others, dad, you're a pussy. - What?! - You're not man enough to be a dad! Is that how you talk to your father?! I'll go with mom to the crisis centre. - I mean it! Just keep your hands off Ali! - Shahbaz! Are you pleased with yourself now? Tell me, Shahbaz. Are you pleased with yourself? You've never hugged your son, never looked him in the eye, never kissed him. What sort of a father are you?! What sort of a father are you?! Huh? If anything happens to my child because of you, I'll chop you up into tiny pieces, you goddamn dog. Ali is Ali. That's just how it is. Alia. Alia. - Hi. - Hello, brother. Here's some tea. - Zubaida? - Yes? - Please. - I can't accept it. - Zubaida... - Thank you, brother. What's up? Zubaida used it to tell your father she was outside. Like this. Shahbaz would sneak out. But there were many who tried to stop us. I made a mistake. Forgive me. You're a good person, Zubaida. Very good. Shahbaz is very fortunate. Huh? Where did that come from? Your brother brought it for me. - I've looked for it everywhere. - I found it among mom's stuff. She wanted Zubaida to have it. - More milk and soft drinks? - It never ends. I know. Maybe it'll calm down when Uncle Ji leaves. Three less litres of Sprite. Every day. So Alia's a girl? Yeah. - And that's okay? - Yeah, seems to be. - I'm a girl too, by the way. - Yeah. I've noticed. - Uh... I have to get the groceries. - Yeah. See you. Zubaida wasn't from our caste. It was a mess. It doesn't mean anything here, mom says. We all scrub toilets and drive taxis. Zubaida and Shahbaz loved each other very much. But I tried to stop them. By the way, why did you never get married? Dad had found two sisters. One for me and one for Shahbaz.
