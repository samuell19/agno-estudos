Click here Please choose a user name and password Welcome, "R” I work at a host bar It's also my 2nd time I'm an office worker This is my 1st time Nice to meet you. It's my 1st, too I work at a small pet shop downtown (Kyosuke) Surely. everyone here's lying! Yeah, but we have to establish some character for ourselves What about you, Kyosuke? Army It's my 1st time on this “battlefield ” -And An? -It's not my 1st time {Monta} So the veterans are Jack. An, and I (Sekine) You also have someane you want killed? (Kyosuke) Yeah, no shit {Monta} Yes, let's keep the conversation to who we want killed I'm going to kill a cabaret girl (Sekine) I want to kill my boss. I can't help it (Kyosuke) Anyone will do for me I just want to kill everyone I want to kill my manager at the "pet shop.” That good-for-nothing can't house train the "pets.” I want him dead Then let's start the killing It's GOD! He's come This is a murder exchange First, I choose one of you at random as “client.” Then the other 5 of you work together to kill the client's target I'm the Almighty. I hand down a verdict after hearing you discuss your targets The 6 of you will rotate among roles How are these roles chosen? “GOD".. only... knows The client sends me information on their target Then, once you've agreed on how to kill the target I'send that information to only the Killer The Preparer of Weapons gets a weapon and tells only the Killer its location The Killer tells only the Destroyer of Evidence the location of the body You lost me there. (Monta} You'll soon understand In short, the other 5 of us will kill that manager you want dead You'll have the perfect alibi with no need to know any of the dirty details We repeat this process 6 times Seems rather roundabout {Monta} It's a game A game? All of you will share a common fate, taking on risks for one another. I need everyone’s consent (An) Count me in (Kyosuke) Sure thing {Monta} Of course (Sekine) Sounds interesting No. more than that. it's thrilling! 'l do it Then let's begin, starting with Sekine's turn Starting with me? You wanted to kill your boss? Yeah, that promotion-obsessed pig of a boss, who thinks he knows all and does all I know how you feel {Monta} Fuckwits like that are beyond saving He also sexually harasses his workers Guilty Then, please decide how to kill him What? _ Just like that? (Client: Sekine) My boss is into bondage, 50 I'd like him tied up, slowly drowned, and dumped into the sea {Monta} Leave it to me So. "death by drowning” for the boss? Preparer of Weapons:Kyosuke Killer:-Monta Destroyer of Evidence:Jack I'm sending the info on Sekine's target to the Killer, Monta (Client: Sekine) I'm counting on all of you (Preparer of Weapons: Kyosuke) All I have to do is ready the rope? Then tell Monta the drop-off location? (Killer: Monta) Yes, then Il pick up the rope, drown that pig boss and mail Jack the location of the body (Destroyer of Evidence: Jack) Then Il dump the body in the sea I don't believe any of them They can't be killing people for real It's just some kind of “virtual” murder, just some nasty little online game -I'm back! Welcome back -Here you go! -Thanks Ryu-chan Can I stay here tonight? Sorry, tonight's no good Something up? Yeah, the manager asked me to take care of something I'm really fed up with that asshole I understand Well, I'll be heading home I'll work hard to pay off your debts! Um thanks Good night! Oh. good night It's past 1 AM, but GOD and the others are a no-show! Sekine's not yet here. either. They'll be here soon (Sekine) My boss has gone missing Huh? You guys didn't really do something to him did you? (Monta} What? Of course we did I tied him up and drowned him proper You don't seem too pleased though Dumping him in the sea wasn't easy! Are you out of your fucking minds? Bring him back by tomorrow If you don't. I'm going to the cops! What. you're quitting on us? I can't be part of this! You'll regret this He logged off Special Tribunal I hereby call a special tribunal into session A special tribunal? Like any game, this one's got penalties Anyone who runs or fails to do their job faces tribunal and becomes a target Members here can carry out the killing by 6 AM tomorrow After that, 'l have my "Angels” do it “Angels?” Sounds like some group of assassins Scary! Is that so Until 6 AM us members can do the killing How do we want to go about it? Canwe do something real gory with dismemberment? Well, how about running him over? And in other news At 7 AM, a man on his way to work fell off the Sakishima Sta. platform and was killed by an inbound train. As a result Until 6 AM us members can do the killing After that, 'l have my Angels do it trains are delayed by 30 minutes Abaut 20.000 rush-hour commuters have been affected Witnesses say the man was in his 30s [6:00] GOD: I've sent out my Angels [7:15] Angels: Sekine's dead Police are investigating it as a possible suicide or accident And now. the weather. You've become quite the sex kitten lately -Please stop -It's all good -No. stop it please! -Just let me fuck you once Seriously, please stop! Nolll No! No! No! Quiet! The next turn goes to Jack Sekine got run over and killed real good. didn't he Of course My Angels always get the job done What's done is done Can we move on now? We're killing this bitch wheo fucked up my life I don’t know why I forgave her all those times she cheated on me (Kyosuke) What a bitch! Let's teach her a lesson! (Monta} As a woman, what's your take? (An) Whatever, killing her is OK with me Guilty I want a "death by suffocation.” I want her abducted and buried alive Nasty! What's the weapon? -Sleeping pills? -Sleeping pills!? Yeah, the Killer knocks out and abducts the target with the pills The Destroyer of Evidence huries her while she's still out But won't the Destroyer of Evidence effectively become the Killer? Shit like that happens sometimes, no? Let's be flexible in our approach here Preparer of Weapons: R Killer: An Destroyer of Evidence: Monta (Preparer of Weapons: R) Sleeping pills. huh? Please make the proper preparations -An (Role: Killer) Well, my curiosity's been piqued An. Ebisu Sta. Locker 64 by S. Exit Key's on top of the locker. -R Sending Are you An? What are you talking about!? .. Hey! Where's the item from the locker? A stranger asked me to open the locker, that's all’ New Message from An {Killer) Nice work I'm hack Oh, uhh...hmmm Can't you do something about the harassment Haru is getting? Talk to Fuyumi and Chinatsu! They don't listen to me You and the manager don't have to pile on and be mean to her. too I've shown her no ill will You're pushing all the creepy customers onto Haru-chan Since then, she's gotten raped And the guy came inside her -I've also been -Shut up! So. what happened to the hush-up money you got from him? Mind your own fucking business You're just here to suck cock, you got that? What's more, that cabaret girl stole money from my account! Can't you just sue her? That's not going to cut it for me The bitch has to die. I want you all to kill her real savage-like R, you're a bit quiet today. aren't you? No. I'm fine Guilty Iwant you to kill her by cutting up her pretty skin So “death by blood loss™ then? Yeah, cut her to shreds with a knife, then bury her somewhere in the hills Does that plan work for everyone? Preparer of Weapons: An Killer: Kyosuke Destroyer of Evidence: R Body is near gate of Kakeyama Shrine Marked by a red cloth. Went overboard! Anyone who runs or fails to do their job faces tribunal and becomes a target -Here you are -Ah, thanks Have a seat Excuse me Actually it's about your manager, Kojima For various reasons, he's been fired Kojima? Why? Haven't you noticed this branch has had unusually bad sales figures? Kojima was giving himself kickbacks So. Il be taking over as manager. Look forward to working with you Uh. yes You surprised? So the owner fired Kgjima This ain't gonna happen again, got it? But I can't quit the game, not anymore IfI do Monta's turn has been completed successfully Let's proceed to An's turn Um, I have a question How do you check that the destruction of evidence has been properly carried out? The Destroyer of Evidence has failed if word of the crime gets out You catch my meaning? It's not easy. You have to do it such that no one knows, like how my Angels made Sekine's death look like an accident -And if word does get out? -Then you bear all the consequences And how Is that GOD... only... knows Then, An. Who do you want judged? Though it was his own fault something bad happened, he pretended not to see it happen Because of him. my precious baby That's horrible Guilty Fuck him up with an acid attack That's good. Really brutal! I want him melted down to his bones Sounds difficult If we splash him with acid and ditch him in the woods Mother Nature will strip him to his bones Preparer of Weapons: Jack Killer: R Destroyer of Evidence: Kyosuke (Preparer of Weapons: Jack) I'l prepare the acid (Destroyer of Evidence: Kyosuke) There's no way you're a teacher! (Killer: R} And I guess I'm doing the killing R, this is An's target Target: Ryuta lwaki Location: "The Honey Box’ Why..? I'm counting on all of you Why am I An's target??

You've been acting strange lately No. I'm OK Really? Yeah, I'm alright. Don't worry No. it can't be Akina R didn't tell me where the body is! So the destruction of evidence? I couldn't do it. but that's R's fault! R, what is the meaning of this? I... I'killed the target Then why didn't you contact Kyosuke? I cut up the body and dumped it in the backwoods He's food for the crows now -Huh? -Don't worry Nothing will be found So. let's move on to the next triall These are pictures of R -Huh? What's this? Hey That's the bottle of acid I prepared! And he's throwing it away. isn't he? How, how how did you Is this for real? This is cowardice. You lied, didn't you! R's real name is Ryuta lwaki He's the receptionist for the Honey Box, a call-girl service OK, I made a mistake. Tomorrow, I'll This is what we call going AWOL, isn't it? It's shirking one's duties That's what it is This calls for a special tribunal We're going to kill you But, but I can't do the killing! I am the the-- the target was me And your point? The rules are absolute This sort of thing can happen An-chan, was he really the target? No. you can't allow that! It creates a bunch of problems if you choose other members as targets! Does anyone else have a problem? Then I hereby call a special tribunal into session So. how should we kill R? Shooting? Oh, how nice. A shooting Impossible! We can't get a hold of a gun I say we can Well, I can't I can try looking for one So. it's settled Death by shooting for R Shooting...?

Actually, I bought something amazing with the money I pocketed I'l show it to you Seriously? Leave tomorrow open What are you doing? Nothing Kyosuke, your work was sloppy.
