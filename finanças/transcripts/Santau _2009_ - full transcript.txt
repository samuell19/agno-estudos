If you don't believe it, see for yourself, Boss. - They've arrived, please come in. - Everyone, please come and eat. Please don't be shy. Please help yours... You at the back, please have more. Come and eat. - Hussein, peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. - O Allah, my friend. - How are you? I haven't seen you in quite a long time. - Have some porridge. - You shouldn't have troubled... yourself. Nina! Look who's arrived. - It's you, Anna. - Hi, Nina. Thank you. You shouldn't have troubled yourself. - It's nothing. - How are you? I'm fine. Lim, don't you want to do anything about your house? I invited you to have a meal and instead you've brought food. I've been thinking about a new design. - Abang, enough of that. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. - Peace be upon you too. - I'm Man. - Nina! - This is my wife. - Thank you. What have you brought? Please come in. Please eat. Have a seat first. I'll take some food for you, alright? - This looks delicious. - Bean porridge. It's delicious. What's this feast for? Just a small thanksgiving feast. Got a government project to... - build a school. - It's the norm for Halim. - He keeps getting projects. - Praise be to Allah. I asked him to join me but he declined. He didn't want to share. - Well, come on. Please come. - Alright. There are so many things. - A drink, Hussein. - Thank you. Halim, here's some bean porridge. It's your favourite, right? Hussein, you shouldn't have troubled yourself. This bean porridge is special. I'll eat it tonight. I'll have this lepat first. I can't resist eating this lepat. I... Dear, invite your friend to eat. O Allah. Man, do come in. Don't be shy. Come on, Man. Don't be shy. O Allah. Our new neighbour is shy. It's raining heavily, dear. You don't have to go to work. You know I have a fever. It might get worse. If I listen to my heart, I don't want to leave you and... - Asiyah in this house. - Dear, here. But the deadline is so close. If I don't do it, who will? It seems like you're not allowing me to go. Oh, dear. Why did you take my marble? I want it back. Why are your eyes white? Ecah, who are you talking to? In the name of Allah, the most... compassionate, the most merciful. Oh, it's a marble. Why is it sticky, Ecah? Here. - Boss. - I seek forgiveness from Allah,... the most esteemed, Onn. Next time, give a greeting. Where are you from? Boss, what are you doing in the dark by yourself? Working, of course. What else? It's the night of Keliwon Friday, Boss. Ghosts and demons are out looking for victims. Aren't you afraid, Boss? If there really is a ghost, I'd like to meet it, Onn. I want to ask it which project grant will come out. You believe too much in this nonsense. Why would you be afraid of ghosts? There's no need to be afraid of ghosts, Boss. But be afraid of those who'd send ghosts to you, Boss. Some can't stand those who are successful. They are full of envy and treachery. You have to be careful, Boss. There's someone who wants to send a ghost to you. Who wants to cause chaos in your family. Boss, ghosts hear our conversation. Really, Onn. You watch too many ghost stories. It's my wife calling. Hello, darling. What's wrong? I'll come home now. Oh, alright. Onn, my wife... Onn? Onn B. Jamal: On leave: 7th - 14th December. Darling? Ecah? Earlier you said you were unwell. Are you feeling better? Yes, I am. Shall we go see Dr. Prakash tomorrow? You never know, you might be pregnant. Okay. I'm hungry. There's food on the table. Well, Doctor? Is she pregnant? Not powerful enough, Mr. Halim. Not powerful enough. There aren't any serious problems, Mr. Halim. Only stomach pains caused by gastric. I'll prescribe some medication for the gastric. You have to make sure that your wife eats on time, alright? It's only gastric, Doctor? It's only gastric, Mr. Halim. But you can keep trying. Is there anything else, Mr. Halim? There's nothing else, Doctor. Thank you very much. You're welcome. Till we meet again, alright? Alright. Nina? Please take this, Aunty. I'm sincere. I thought Aisyah would be getting a younger sibling. But instead it's gastric. We just held a feast. - Dear? - Yes? Did you know that these past few days... Ecah's been acting weird? She talks to herself. I'm afraid. Ecah is talking to herself? What did she say? She said, I've been going out with my girlfriend? What's wrong with you?! I'm telling the truth! So it's true! You do have another woman! You're not bothered with whatever happens to me at home! If this is how you behave, I regret marrying you! You're not bothered at all with whatever I say! You're really too much! No wonder everyone didn't want me to marry you! So this is how you behave! This is how you treat me! Whether I die or my child dies, you don't care at all! God knows what Man does behind our house... do you bother to find out? I've been vomitting, coughing blood... and yet you don't believe me! You're not bothered at all about me and our child! What's wrong with you? You asked me to switch off the cell phone and I did! I couldn't answer important calls, did you know that?! - Dear, where are you going? - The shop! Dear, enough of that. Aren't you deterred as yet of others being angry with you? As it is, we moved here because others were angry with us. So enough of that. Well, there. - It's the stupid pole. - Enough of that. - On top of that, he puts on airs. - Dear. I don't have the energy to cook tonight. Halim, what's wrong with you? You seem out of sorts to me. I don't feel right. - What's the matter? - It's Nina. What's wrong with Nina? She told me she saw weird things. Things that don't make sense, Hussein! She argued with me just now. She yelled at me! She's never done this before, Hussein. Halim, I think someone's used black magic on you. I don't believe in all that. Well, I'm not knowledgeable about these... things, but I can ask my friend. I'll go this afternoon, alright? Please help me, Hussein. Please keep an eye out for Nina. It worries me. My neighbour seems weird to me. It's alright. I'll go this afternoon. Ecah! Let's go home! Enough. Your father is calling you. Thank you for keeping an eye on Ecah. That's alright. It's just a small matter. - I'll be off now, Hussein. - Dear, please help me. Hey, Khairul. I heard you were in the hospital. - Yes, Abang Halim. - What was wrong? It's because of envy and jealousy, Abang Halim. - Are you going home? - Yes, take good care of yourself. - Peace be upon you, Abang Halim. - Peace be upon you too. What's with you?! You didn't want to die when you were younger! I wanted to eat fried eggs! After your father, you are... causing me problems! Pick it up! I said, pick it up! Pick it up! Hurry! Nina wants chicken, Halim? Obviously, she's pregnant. No, she's not. Here, Halim. That'll be RM 5. No wonder she looks pale. You're too much. Thank you, Halim. Hold on, take your change. - I'm giving at as alms. - Thank you, Halim. I didn't notice you wanted to back up. It's you, Hussein. - Now you're driving a lorry? - My worker is unwell. So I have to drive it. What have you bought? It's for Nina. You know how it is. My friend said he can help with that... what we spoke about this afternoon. - Really? - It's a small matter. - Giving you so much trouble. - Of course not. - Alright, thank you very much. - It's nothing, drive carefully. - Can I go out? - Yes, you can. - Just reverse straight out. - You're too much, Hussein. Just keep going straight. Nina? Nina... Get lost! Where's Ecah? Ecah... Dad, I'm scared. Dear, what did you buy for dinner? I'm sorry. I fell asleep. O Allah, my God. I seek protection from You, O Allah. If this is the trial You have given me... I hope that I'll be able to bear it. Do accept my prayer, O Allah, Lord of the worlds. Are you about to go to work? Please don't go to work. I don't feel right, dear. Please don't go. I have to go to work, darling. I have to finish my work, alright? I promise that I'll be home early. I'll be home before noon. Why are there eggs in the middle of the house? Ecah, I'm late as it is. Dear! - Peace be upon you, Mr. Halim. - Peace be upon you too. - Good morning, Mr. Halim. - Good morning. - Hello. - Good morning, Mr. Halim. - Good morning. - What about the appointment? Onn! You surprised me! - What are you doing there? - Can't you see this? It's glass. Did you have a fight yesterday? - Oh, dear. - Have you cleaned it up? Yes, I have, Boss. Boss, what's with your arm? I had a dream yesterday, someone held my arm. Didn't expect this would happen. - Does it hurt, Boss? - No. Boss, I think... It's up to you whether you believe it or not, but... you should see a religious teacher. I'm feeling weird. Glory be to Allah. Glory be to Allah. Glory be to Allah. Glory be to Allah. Glory be to Allah. Glory be to Allah! Do you think a ghost heard what I said? Boss, what are you saying? Wasn't it last Friday night... you told me that ghosts can hear what we say? Which Friday night, Boss? I was on leave for a week. I just came back this morning. - Boss? - Yes? Don't forget to go and see a religious teacher. Pity your wife and Ecah. Don't forget, Boss. - Hello? - Darling? Dear, come home. I'm afraid, dear. There's a ghost in this house. There's a Yassin surah on the... dressing table. Hold tight to that Yassin surah. Please come home, dear! I'm scared! Yah! Please move your lorry! Dear! Yah... What is it? Thank you. Hello, Hussein. Dear! Dear! Hey, ghosts! I know your origin. In the name of your master... I order you to leave this place! Nina? Nina? Nina! Nina, it's me! Say your creed. Please say your creed. I seek forgiveness from Allah, the most Esteemed. Dear! Oh, dear. In the name of Allah, the most... Compassionate, the most Merciful. I seek forgiveness from Allah, the most Esteemed. Why has this happened? Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest. I seek forgiveness from Allah, the most Esteemed. There is no god except Allah. Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest. Allah is the Greatest. - Halim? - Yes? What's the matter with your wife and child? What is it, Mak Andak? Someone used black magic on your wife and child. I'm not capable of curing them. I'm not capable. Please find someone more experienced to cure Nina. What black magic is this, Mak Andak? Who would want to do this to me? If people want to do bad things, they won't tell us. Here, Mak Andak. Look at this, Mak Andak. Allah is the Greatest. Why didn't you do something about this, Halim? After I go to the hospital, this will be alright. This cannot be cured at the hospital, Halim. I'm feeling fine after Mak Andak massaged me, dear. - Are you okay? - I'm okay, let's go home. Ecah. Thank you, Mak Andak. I'll be going now, alright? Aisyah. In the name of Allah, the most Compassionate, the most Merciful. Allah! There is no God but He, the Living and Selfsubsisting... Eternal. No slumber can seize Him nor sleep. His are all things in the heavens and on earth. Who is there can intercede in His presence except as He permit? He knoweth what appeareth to His creatures as before or after... or behind them. Nor shall they compass aught of His knowledge... except as He willeth. His Throne doth extend over the heavens and... the earth, and He feels no fatigue in guarding and... preserving them for He is the most High... the Supreme. I'll be going now, Mak Andak. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. Lim, don't forget what I told you. - Don't take it lightly, Lim. - Alright. Let's go home. What is it? It's a blackout. Enough of that. I'll go downstairs. Just for a short while. - Dear! - Wait a while. - Where are you going? - Just to check on the fuses. - There's no need. - I have to. We're in the dark. - Dear! - What?! Dear! - O Allah! - I'm afraid, dad. - What's wrong, Ecah? - I'm scared. Come here. Come to me. I'm here. Don't be scared, alright? - I'm scared, dad. - Hug me. Don't be scared, alright? Hug me tightly. Who could it be? Peace be upon you, Halim. I heard someone screaming. I take refuge in Allah from Satan the accursed. - Nina? - Dad, where's mum? Nina? Nina! Halim! That's not your wife. - That's my wife, Man! - Halim! Move aside. - Let me help you. - Mom! Glory be to Allah. Glory be to Allah. Glory be to Allah. Glory be to Allah. I take refuge in Allah from satan the accursed. In the name of Allah, the most Compassionate, the most Merciful. Glory be to Allah. Praise be to Allah. There is no God except Allah. Allah is the Greatest! I seek forgiveness from Allah, the most Esteemed. Glory be to Allah. Praise be to Allah. I bear witness there is no God except Allah. Allah is the Greatest! Halim, hold your wife. Aisyah, stay here, alright? I need to help your mother. Nina? Nina? Nina! In the name of Allah, the most Compassionate, the most Merciful. Seest thou not how thy Lord dealt with the companions of... the elephant? Did He not make their treacherous plan go astray? And he sent against them flights of birds... striking them with stones of baked clay. Then did He make them like an empty field of stalks and straw... of which the corn has been eaten up. In the name of Allah, the most Compassionate, the most Merciful. Glory be to Allah. Praise be to Allah. There is no God except Allah. Allah is the Greatest! - Auntie, I need to pee. - You need to pee? Hold it in for a while. - Where do you want to go? - To my father. Dad, I want to pee. Hold it in for a while. We'll be there soon. - Then you can go, alright? - Enough. Where are we? We're on the way to seek treatment. There's no need to seek treatment. Whatever for? I want to go home. Please turn back. Enough, darling. You're in a bad condition. - Man! - Dear? I said, turn back! Turn back! Dear, hurry up. Turn back! Stupid! In the name of Allah, the most Compassionate, the most Merciful. - Turn back! - I take refuge in Allah from... - Satan the accursed. - Sees thou not how thy Lord... dealt with the companions of the elephant? Did He not make their treacherous plan go astray? Keep reciting. I said, turn back! Stupid! There's a Yassin CD in the front. Play that. - Put it on. - Hurry up. - Hurry up, Man. - Alright. - Hold your wife, Halim. - I am. Hold her, Halim! Hold her, Halim. Don't let her get out. I pulled her back in. - Say your creed, Nina. - Hold her, Halim. I seek forgiveness from Allah, the most Esteemed. Say your creed, Halim! Say your creed! - Halim! - Halim?! Say your creed, Halim!

Cover her legs as well. May you live with a drop of virgin blood. I call out your name. May you come because you have not left. Come here, because you are within her. May you live. May you live, because you have not left! I seek forgiveness from Allah, the most Esteemed. I know your origin! You´re ugly! You are contempt! You are evil! I am noble. Do you want to be more contempt than this? What I am hitting is not your body. What I am hitting is your soul. Serves you right! Do you want to play? Halim, a black magic curse has been cast upon your wife. It's not a stranger. It's your neighbour. - I knew it! - I am Hussein. - Hussein? - I guessed as much, dear. Here's some bean porridge. It's your favourite, right? I'm scared, Auntie! I'm scared! Halim, quickly take this water. Quickly pour it over your wife. Pour it over her, Halim! He's very powerful. Carry your wife.
