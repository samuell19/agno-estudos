And by the way, your smoking can badly influence my health. You should quit this disgusting habit. Okay... Ehmmm... So it was you then, who placed the advertisement, that you need a housekeeper? Honest, with nice character... Here I am! - But we actually invited a nanny. - Ehmm...And who needs a nanny here? Such an agressive dog you have. - I hope, Mrs. Bok, that you like children, right? How to say? I am crazy about them! Well you can go to work. Don?t worry. Ok. - And I bet that soon you won?t even recognize your child. Dank u. - Give me the pastry! First, sweet things harm your shape. Second, go to sleep! Third, make your homework. And what else? What else can you do? What a hard labour to teach somebody. And hey, I forgot! Wash your hands! - And why then to wash them? Anyway there is nothing to eat. - Matilda, you hear me? Baby, watch this beast. Be careful though ? a dog has many germs. Karlson. Karlson!!! - Why are you shouting? You scared all the fish. - Hello, Karlson! - Hello, Baby. Look, why don?t you ask where I have been for such a long time? - And where have you been? - You see! I visited my granny. Yup! What a babushka I have! When she sees me she shouts out loud: "My dear little Karlson!" And after that she embraces me with all her strength! My granny... She is the champion of the world in embracing. - Wow, really? - Don?t you believe me? Of course I do. And finally you flew here. - Yep. But, hey, mind what you say! How can I fly with such a motor? I almost crashed on the road. Listen! You see? True. - I urgently need a refill. Cake with cream would be nice! - Oops? But I guess? there is no cake? - Are you crazy? Your dearest friend flies such a long distance, and you have no cake!!!! - But we had no idea even. - Do you have any ideas in common? You should have hoped, with all your heart, and wait! - Look, maybe you would like this: there are fried sausages in the kitchen. - Fried? - Yep. - Hey, being in your place one learns to eat different kinds of garbage. Well, fine, give it to me. - Oops, the door is locked. - What? Locked, why? - This is because of the housekeeper. But in fact she's just a household maniac. - Don?t cry, don?t cry. Is that you who cries, or me? - I cry. - And I don?t cry. - You better don?t cry. - Look, and who is this house freak? Good evening, my dear friends! We begin our program ?The life of ghosts?.

Nope, you didn?t understand, but I will explain to you. - Go ahead. - Excuse me, and who is this? - This? This is Karlson, who lives on the roof! - Excuse me, but was it you who buzzed in my ears, right? You? Well to be honest, that was me. So was it you who stole my pastry? - Stop! And you have your milk boiled over. - Oh my God! Milk! Hey, wait a moment, what milk? I don?t boil any milk. Again joking, naughty child? Wow, that is so sad that you are not a ghost. But why? - Because right now the TV journalists are heading here. I called them to tell about my ghost. And what will I tell them now? How come you don?t know. And me? What about me?! I am a smart, good looking, and well padded man. And in full bloom of course! - Yes of course, but there are plenty of such guys as you on TV. But I am also talented. Attention!
