Do you Andy? I'm Tina. Did you wait long? There was a big delay at the exit. I'm telling you, the spitz on this island ... I lost track of time. Do not worry. Do you work at a surf school? Gives. I am a surf instructor and a taxi driver, all in one. What to do? Times are tough. Welcome to the wilderness! Good. ... and then somehow warmed up for the surf shop. Sounds wonderful. My time mostly depends on who my students are. How long are you staying at Fuerteventura? I do not know yet. First a surf course. And then ... we'll see. All I know is I don’t have a return plane ticket. And I also wanted to stay a few days. But the days turned into months and then, well, years. And what are you going to do? Are you going back to Germany? I just graduated. I thought I'd see what was going on outside. Office work ... That's not what I want, though. I just need to move on. I hear you. Have you surfed before? I didn't, but I always wanted to. My father surfed. Oh, really? When he was younger. Cool. And today? I have no idea. He lives here on the island. Not possible! He doesn't know I'm coming. I only know him from photos. Sounds like an exciting vacation. Sorry, I was supposed to deliver something here yesterday. I'll be right back! Off land Here we are. Your house for the next few days. And your car. Wonderful. Hello! I brought someone with me. This is Andi. Come on, I'll show you where to live. Folks, this is Andy. He starts the course tomorrow. Well, get ready. That girl is a slave hunter. I'm glad. Do you want something? Cappuccino? Who? Cocktail? The car is fine. Have you been down to the beach? Yes, just now. Do you need a glass? It's great. The waves are a little fast, but ... Wonderful, isn't it? There is no better place in the world to surf than Fuerteventura. No wonder I stayed here. Does everyone here surf? Almost everyone. That’s the reason most people come here. Okay, and ... what else? What do you mean? What about work? Of course, everyone works here. As surf instructors or in a hotel. You can always find a job here. Do you know him? Pedro? Yes, he comes here sometimes. I saw him in the water when I was on the beach. Impressive. He does his thing. What do you mean? He usually keeps to himself. I really don't know him. Did you talk to your father? Not. It's a surprise. In fact, I need to find him first. All I have is a name and a few photos. Oh, really? I wonder if he even remembers me. I understand. I thought Tina was on a course? Oh, she'll be around. Excuse me, folks. I got stuck in traffic. Are you ready to conquer the ocean? Okay - then let's do some stretching. This is my new favorite student! I thought you'd never show it. Do not lose hope. Let's get! Hands aside! small circular movements ... which are slowly spreading. That's right. Really wide ... great. Do your shoulders already hurt? Want to do it one more time? I know you will. All right, take your boards and come with me to shore. Come on! All the boards in line ... nose forward. So. And take your position ... look ahead. Great. Proper position on the board is very important. Okay, I'll show you the correct and safe position for your head. Hitting your head on a board is the most dangerous thing which can happen while surfing, so when you fall into the water cover your face with one hand and your neck with the other. That's right. This should be a relaxation. Try again ... that's right. Then you can fasten your strap to your leg and you come ashore with your board. Am I doing this well? Wait. Cover your face ... your nose ... Hands on top of your head. Great. Hey, Tina! If you continue to work hard, we can enter it in the competition. We have a surfing competition here on the island. North against South. That's why everyone here trains like crazy. Are you for that? I am too old for such things. What, are you afraid of water? Get in! I ... take it easy. If you are taking a surfing course - you're going to have to get in the water at some point . Hello, father. Andreas? Au. What are you doing here? I'm on vacation. I mean, I'm taking a surfing course. How are you? How is your mother? It's fine. She recovered. I graduated. That's wonderful. What did you study? Economics. I wasn't sure if I wanted to do that, so ... Pa, new tebi! I wanted to call, but I didn't have an address or a phone number ... I didn't know if you wanted to ... Well, I really came for a surfing course. The only thing that matters is that you're here. I never thought you'd come. What can I do for you? Don't tell me you need a belt. In fact, I wanted to ... never mind. How did it go? It was nice. His name is Chris. And you've never met him before? He left before I was born. Because of a Spanish girl. Listen, we have a barbecue on the beach tonight. Surf school students and a few friends. Do you want to come? I'm meeting Chris after the shift. Then come back later. Please come Yes, why not. See you there! You yes! Shall we take a walk? Of course. And? All is well? All is well. I had my first surf lesson. Ah! Wonderful. I'm sure you're natural. You got that from me. We should surf together one day. My mother told me. That you surfed, I think. Surfing was the first reason I came here. I can hardly get close to that now. Did she talk about me sometimes? Only when she was drunk. How did you find me? I had to look for you. You are not in the phone book. Oh, right. Shall we. The view is wonderful. So what does your mother say about being here? She doesn't greet you, if that's what you mean. Good good. Is he still with that woman? Mary? Not. But we are still friends. After all, she's from here. Do you know a guy who ... I was born to be a lone wolf Marriage and family, this whole thing, it's not for me. I was lucky, you know? It's wonderful here. What about you, do you have a girlfriend? Currently not. I find it hard to hold on. I was so happy when you suddenly showed up. I always longed for that. I also. Do you want to go surfing with me tomorrow? I'll show you my favorite place. I'll show you what I can do. Why not. Of course. I'm Pedro. Andi. Are you going to catch the waves? They are great today. I went to a beach party. Do you want to come with me? No, I wouldn't. That's not for me. Have a good time! I'm glad to see you. Come on, I'll introduce you. This is Andi. Do you want a drink? Of course. Well, how was it. Strange. He lives in a camp ... He lives in a caravan? I'm not sure. I didn't see his apartment. There are also several houses. I stopped the car suddenly, he was there. So I don't know where he came from. I really have no idea. I anticipate big things. Which one is the line of destiny? This one? That's right. Really? Gives. Are you cold? A little. This is wonderful. So, what are your plans now? What do you mean? Well, here. I'll meet Chris again tomorrow ... And what are you going to do next with him? I do not know. I came here because I wanted to see him. I wanted to know what he was like. So maybe I'm starting to understand who I am. I know who you are. Oh, really? Get up and shine! We'll be on the beach in 5 minutes. Surfing course, remember? Oh no ... Stand up! What is this? It's not important. Come on, what's wrong? I think I'll stay here. Come on, get inside! No... What's happening? I'll stay here. Come on ... Born. I'll come in later, I promise. Oh, stop whining. Tomorrow I will personally push you into the water. That is my mission now. Do you want me to show you some tricks? Are you sure I can learn something from you? Oh, don't pretend to be important. You're good, pro! Come on, now it's your turn. What, are you scared? Come on, I'm here. Word of mouth is my specialty. Show me what you got, tiger! I'll come in once. Sure. In a year probably. How was the blue party? Good. It was okay. I’m really not for stuff like that. Ni ja. My bed is small for two anyway. For memory. Thanks. Are you all right? Oh, that? That. I haven't been well in a while. Long. Last year. Why do you speak German so well? Well, considering the hordes of Germans who invade the island during the year ... Hey you two! Are you busy? I give him some advice. He's so bad. Well, I'm his teacher. I have to go. I need to meet Chris. Have a nice time! Will we see each other tomorrow? I work in a store, but you could stop by ...? Yes, of course, I'll practice tomorrow anyway. Can I join you? If you can get out of bed so early ...? I knew. Oh, come on, Chris ... I'm glad to see you! We had plans for today! What, today? Yes, today. We were supposed to go surfing, remember? Wow, I completely forgot. I was just ... the waves were so great. However it turns out What? You know, life on the island here is at a different pace. I was looking forward to it. Me too, me too. I promise I'll make it up to you. How about I show you the place now? A bar? Do you see anyone here? And. Let's go! It's not important. It's getting dark anyway. How about tomorrow? That! That. Tomorrow. I'll see you then! I was wondering why someone like you is taking a surfing course? What do you mean? You don't seem to have much fun. I have always had respect for the ocean. I see. Waves, depth, cold ... a lot can happen. It's like having the best day of your life. Yes, or to fart in the tub. Sometimes I get scared too. Why? I think that name has something to do with my father. I know what you mean. You know? My father left us before I was born. He never cared about me. Are you sure? He may not have been a family guy. Other priorities, you know. Yes, obviously. Wrong priorities. The father is so preoccupied with his life that it prevents him from noticing anything else. And that destroys everything. I even think he wants to change, but he keeps messing around. He can't do anything against himself, and we all have to suffer. If he loved me, he would show it. I mean, it's about us! But he doesn't understand that. I’m sure he wants the best for all of us. But that’s so frustrating when you never know what are you up to with someone. But maybe it's your fault after all. He never said, "I love you." And you want so little, but even that seems so little. Why are you still here When I'm in the water, I feel good. I need to go now. I think I'll stay here. Will you be here later? Maybe. Is it something you do regularly? What? You risk your job like you did last night. Eh, that's not a big deal. They would never fire me. You know. How is the surfing course progressing? Going well. I met some nice people. Thanks for coming. It took me a while to decide. Things just didn’t go well then. "You didn't get better" ...? You left Mom and me. And we never heard from each other again. Is that what she told you? She never mentioned anything else? No. What else was he supposed to mention? We were so young, your mother and I. And that was not serious between us. She said it was out of the question to keep you. And I ... I trusted her. Under those circumstances, that was closest to the truth. I found out she gave birth to you much later. I was already living here then, and she would hang up every time I called. What? We never made a plan for the future together. "Maybe". However it turns out. I already thought you weren't coming! Sorry, I had something to do. Is everything fine? Did something happen? All is well. Don't worry about me, okay? Stupid fool. Oh shit ... You look pretty beaten up. Did they use you as cannon fodder in a surfing competition? Are you all right? Sorry, I ... Wait! It's okay ... I get it. I need to tell you something. Let's go. We are brothers. My mother was the reason your father came to the island. A little later I was born. I wanted to tell you earlier, but Chris was against it. He wanted me to wait ... for him to tell you himself ... whatever. You saw what he could be ... he could be. I think that was a mistake. What? I just wanted to meet you so much , I was so curious. Hey, Andi. Wait! Just one more word ... I made a complete fool of myself. You are an idiot! Why didn't you ever tell me ?! Hey now ... calm down. Come on. Can you imagine what I looked like in front of Pedro? I'll tell you: like a fucking idiot! I'm sorry. Are you sorry ?! I really thought we could start over ... and then ... Why are you doing this? Why are you lying to me, and why didn't you tell me I had a brother? And why didn't you ever try to connect with me? I'm really sorry. I was waiting for the right moment to tell you about Pedro. And somehow that moment never came. Cowards. You suddenly showed up here and we had such a good relationship. My relationship with Pedro has always been difficult, I just didn't want to take any chances with you. Come on, you just didn't care. You were hoping I would leave soon and that I will never find out about it. So you can continue to live your fucking excuse for life without any obligations and responsibilities! You got away with it, as always. You got away with it, as always. All you care about is you and your stupid waves. I never meant anything to you. You're right. I'm a coward. And an old fool who always chooses the easiest way to get out. But I never wanted to hurt you. But you did. Me ... and mom. And others, too, obviously. I know I made a huge mistake. But your mother didn't want to have anything to do with me. Not a letter, nothing. Not even a phone conversation. I respected that, even though it wasn’t easy. Nonsense! You were glad you got rid of us! Go to hell! You steered the way I imagined you would be. Another thing? Coffee, please. Have you been to the beach? This morning. How was it? Not so nice, too windy. Maybe in the afternoon. Maybe. Come on, I'll get you something to eat. Sorry, Tina. Why didn't you tell me earlier that you didn't like me? That's not true. It was so nice of you to take care of me. I didn't want to spoil it. Cowards. Oh yes. How do you say, "Don't shit where you eat" or something? I guess I should take that advice to heart. You know, this is basic when you're surfing. There's a huge wave coming, and in the beginning you shit. It is out of the question for me to ride it. But it could be the perfect wave. The one you're waiting for. And that's why you have to climb it. You take a risk, even if he blows your face. Who knows when such a wave will reappear, maybe never again. And then you will be angry with yourself for the rest of your life for not taking such a chance. And if you fall ... well, then you just get up after that. Amen. Well fashion I could stick to that a little tighter. But it is true! So who won the competition in the end? We, of course. I mean, just look at the great work I do every day with my beginners ... Can I? Sorry. What you did was wrong. I know. I know. Good. Why don't you stay a little longer? Hey, tiger! Come! Are you ready? For yesterday ... It's OK. Do not worry. You're just as lazy as your father, if you could really train. We will work on your reflexes, my friend! I think time is on my side. Translated by Mita
