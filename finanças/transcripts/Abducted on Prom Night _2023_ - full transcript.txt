♪ (dance music playing) ♪ ♪ (man rapping indistinctly) ♪ You're not thinking of leaving, are you? The party's just getting started. It's not gonna be the same without you. You want a drink? Let me find you a drink. Thanks, but I'm already finishing my first one. I have an early morning tomorrow, so... You know those ride-share apps are pretty dangerous. Who knows where you'll end up. Hell, you might even find yourself in a Prius. Tell you what, stick around, I promise I'll get you home myself. Safe and sound. I'm Luke. Sorry, Luke, I'm sure you're a very good driver, but I'm gonna take my chances. Don't say I didn't warn you. Kimber! If I knew you were going to brush off the hottest guy here, I never would have invited you. Uh, well, you promised I'd have a good time, remember? You're not? We're at a college party, Kimber. No more parents' basements or high school gymnasiums. After all those years in the kiddie pool, finally we get to dive right in. Believe me, he's all yours. I think his name's Luke, by the way. Luke. I like it. Look, my dad cheated on my mom too. It doesn't mean you get to be a total buzzkill forever. Buzzkill? Seriously? It's cruel, but it's true. I mean, my parents split when I was a sophomore. You got an extra two years. It sucks, but it makes you tougher. As long as you remember to never to stop dancing with your friends. (laughing) But first, I'm gonna go show that boy what he's been missing all his life. (speaking inaudibly) Hi. For Kimber? Yeah. (ignition starting) Hey, could you turn up that song? It's my favorite. Oh, sorry, I think there's been a mistake. Can you stop the car? Stop the car! (tires squealing) Stop the car! Let me the hell out of here! Stop the car! Help! Help! Somebody help me! Help! Help! Help! Help! (ignition starting) Man: Hey! (elevator dinging) Hi. Hi. How's my favorite employee? Um, employees get paid, Dad. Even if they're just the coffee runner. (chuckling) Well, there's nothing wrong with gaining some experience, even if it is unpaid, right? (scoffing) All right. Oh, we got to go. I don't want to be late for my test. Excuse me, since when were you ever in a hurry to get back to school? Ever since Mom threatened to extend my lockdown if I don't get straight B's. - Still grounded, huh? - (Kimber scoffing) Complete lockdown's more like it. Try to take it easy on your mother, okay? She's kind of going overboard ever since... You know. Ever since I almost got kidnapped. You can't you even say the words. You're okay, though, right? You're better? That's my girl. Um, do me a favor. Would you please put this in the safe for me? You know, Dad, they invented this thing called a bank to store your money in (keypad beeping) Yeah, well, I will take my chances with a good old-fashioned safe any day. Kimber: Okay. And you're sure you want to trust your delinquent teenage daughter with the password? Hang on, I'm thinking. I'm kidding! Honey, listen, I would trust you with anything. Okay. Well... - Let's go. - Right. (car horns blaring) Paul: Say hi to your mom for me. Sure. Okay. Oh, and, uh... ace that test. Bye. Teacher: Miss McCann. A word with you in the hallway. Kimber: Is there a problem? Can you explain these? Signatures from my friends. It's a worldwide custom. (sighing) Principal's office. Now. (sighing) Hi, Mom. That's Principal McCann when you're sitting in that chair. Look, it was just one test. And I didn't mean to cheat. I wrote down the answers as a joke, and then they wouldn't wash off. You did? Or your friend Everleigh did? I recognize her handwriting. Everleigh had nothing to do with this. This isn't about one test, Kimber. Your grades are dropping across the board. Are you still even expecting to graduate? What happened to all of your plans? Plans change. I'm still gonna graduate. Well, I hope getting into a good college wasn't part of those plans, because you're killing any chance of that. Honey, what is going on with you? Kimber: I don't know. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that you and Dad obliterated our entire family unit last year. (sighing) There will come a time when you can no longer blame every bad decision on your father and I getting divorced. Are you talking to me as my principal right now, or my mom? Shawna: If I was speaking to you as your mom, this conversation would be going very differently. I don't know how much trouble I can get in. I have one working hand, and I'm under your house arrest. Austin. Hi. Are you here to see my mom? Yeah. College applications help. Oh, be careful. I think I set her off. Of course. - I'll see you later. - Okay, bye. - (knocking) - Hi, Principal McCann. Is now a good time? Of course, Austin. Have a seat. Austin: Okay. (Austin clearing throat) So, first, is everything okay with Kimber? Yes. Why wouldn't things be? Well, I might have heard something about a test this morning. (laughing) You're a good kind, Austin. It must be quite the challenge dating a girl who can't leave her house outside of school. Honestly, I completely understand you being a little overprotective, especially after what happened. I know I'm still new around here, but I just hope that I can prove myself to you and to Kimber. Now, let's talk college applications, shall we? Um, well, actually, there was something that I wanted to talk about first. Okay. Everleigh: It's just one test. Big deal. Tell that to Principal Mom. I would, except she hates me. - She doesn't hate you. - Look, I get it. I'm a mom's worst nightmare. Complex morals and a winning smile, and undying loyalty to my besties. Oh, my God. Ew. A prom-posal? I'm gonna puke. Austin: So, what do you say? Austin! Of course I'd love to go with you. But my mom. Well, that's already taken care of. I didn't actually need help with college. I just wanted to ask permission to let me take you. Oh, you went behind my back? What'd she say? She said yes. Austin, you're amazing. Save it for prom night, you two. Okay. - Well, I'll call you later? - Kimber: Yeah. All right. Oh, my God! Ugh! People are staring at us. Hey, just because your boyfriend didn't do anything special for you... College guys don't buy you flowers. They buy you weekend getaways. What? I thought you hadn't... We haven't. Not yet. Believe it or not, I do have a tiny bit of self-control. - Oh. - (laughing) (tires squealing) What is it? Uh, nothing. Just, the SUV. I thought it was... I thought you told me you were over all that. I thought I was. I see you found your prom invitation. So cute. I rest my case. You know, Austin asked me what your favorite flower is so that he could get you the right kind. You remembered? That's what best friends do. (laughing) Let's go. Okay. Look, um... I'll see you later, okay? Could I talk to you for a sec? In private? Just hold these for a sec? Yeah. So... how's French class going? You wanted to talk about French class? Listen, I know that we're not as close as we once were. And that's fine. People grow apart. Whatever. It's just, I miss you. That's all. I miss you too. But, look, I've just been busy with helping my dad at work and college applications. I know. I get it. Well, I should probably be heading home. I'll see you later, okay? Wait. Why don't you just come to prom with us? Prom? I don't even have a date. You could be my plus-two. It'll be a night to remember. (both laughing) (sighing) Shawna: Well, look at you! I haven't seen you smile like that in a long time. I see teeth! (laughing) Thanks. For trusting me. Well, thank Austin. He's the one who convinced me to let you go. He promised to take full responsibility for your safe return. Is he supposed to be my date or my chaperone? The best ones can be both. Now come on, let's go before the stores close. Go where? I thought I'm still on house arrest. To get you a prom dress, of course. Got to find you something to wear. Okay. - (laughing) Yay. - Come on. (Shawna sighing) (phone ringing) (cell phone vibrating) (inhaling sharply) Shawna, everything okay? Shawna: Everything's fine. I wanted to talk to you about Kimber, if you had a second. Uh, yeah. Is she in some sort of trouble? No. No. Well, yes, technically, but that's not why I'm calling. I wanted your input on something. My input? Wow. I can't remember the last time you asked me for that. Shawna: I've decided to let her go to prom. She's upstairs right now trying on a dress. And here I was thinking you were going to keep her under lock and key until she turned 25. Shawna: That was the plan. But I saw how unhappy it was making her. Maybe it's time we let her get back out there. Does she have a date? Shawna: Not just any date. He's a really great kid. He's polite, he's responsible. His name's Austin. Paul: Well, that all seems great to me. So you're on board? I wanted her dad's opinion on this. Don't you usually work these things as a chaperone anyway? Yeah. I'll be checking bags at the door, and making sure everyone's dancing three feet apart. And I might have installed a GPS tracking feature on Kimber's phone, you know, just in case if she loses it, I can help her find it. Shawna! Shawna: Paul, she's our daughter. And we almost lost her two months ago, So safety trumps privacy. Paul: I suppose you're right. Um... How are you doing? You okay? I'm good, Paul. Yup. Doing all right. Listen, I'm going to send you pictures from prom, okay? Keep you posted. Paul: Okay. Um, thank you. Good luck. Okay. (phone beeping off) (sighing) (sighing) Shawna: Kimber, how's it fit? You can come in, Mom. Shawna: Oh! Baby! You look beautiful! - You really think so? - Yeah. I think you're going to have a wonderful night. (laughing) I like it. (Joan coughing and sniffling) (spraying) You okay? Yeah, it's just the hairspray. Ugh. It's like you're fog-bombing a wasp's nest in here, Everleigh. We'll see who's laughing when my hair is still perfect eight hours from now. I intend to get a little bit messy. By the way, I asked Luke to grab us a bottle for tonight. A bottle of what? - Booze? - (scoffing) Well, aren't you the sweetest thing, Flu-liet. What's Flu-liet? Freshman-year English. Everyone had to read a scene from Romeo & Juliet out loud in class. I wasn't feeling well that day, and I begged my mom to let me stay home. (mock retching) To her credit, she did catch most of it in her backpack. She's been calling me that ever since. It's not like I'm the only one. It's a term of endearment. Okay, play nice tonight, guys. Austin went all out getting this limo. Right. Play nice. Got it. And as for the bottle, I told my mom we'd stay out of trouble. And I intend to keep that promise. Lame. ♪ Hotshot coming for the crown I won ♪ ♪ Fix your face with that frown, ironic ♪ Oh, wait, you're just a little bit crooked. - There. - Thank you. Okay, kids. Group photo. All right. One, two, three. - (camera clicking) - Yes! How about one of just Joan and I? Shawna: Sure. Okay. Yes. That's great. Aw. I remember when you two used to dress up as princesses. Now look at the both of you. The real thing. Um, do you have it? Oh, yeah. Thanks. Austin... - You've done so much. - Austin: Aw. Kimber: I just wanted to show my appreciation. Oh, I love it. - (Kimber laughing) - Thank you. Uh, Mom. Okay, okay, okay. Can I just get one more? Just the girls, though. - (laughing) Sorry, boys. - Yeah. Yeah. - Okay, come. - Okay. Okay, just line up right there. Hold on a minute. Going to take me some time. Oh! Hold on. (laughing) Technology. Okay. Okay. Oh... Mommy's going to get it. I'll get it. Okay, perfect. Sorry, excuse me. Uh, ladies and gentlemen, our ride is here. - Joan: That's all just for us? - Austin: Yeah. I wanted tonight to be memorable. The best night of our lives. - Hi. Come on in. - Driver: Hey. Hey, everybody. Uh, my name's Dan. I'll be your driver tonight. - Which one of you is Austin? - That's me. Hello. Great, if you could just sign there. Um, I'll take a moment to explain the ground rules. One: no roughhousing in the limousine. Heads and arms must remain inside at all times. Two, any cleaning costs will be added to the rental fee. And three, no drugs or alcohol. (scoffing) Everyone ready for a great time? I mean, we were. - (laughing) - Austin: So let's do it? - Yeah? - Yeah! All right. Yay! - Bye. - Take good care of her, okay? Yes. You have my word. Ma'am. Shawna, let her have her fun. - (limo door closing) - Let her have her fun. (ignition starting) Whoo! Yeah! Stop. We haven't even popped off yet, and you've already breaking rule number one. Just wait till you see what I do to rule three. (chuckling) All right, where's the bottle? Oh. Yeah. Sorry, babe. I didn't have time to stop. Everleigh: You're kidding me. I'm supposed to get through tonight sober? Ugh! It's not even stocked. Can't we still have a good time without it? - Ugh! - It's prom night. Joan's right. Austin is the most amazing. - (static crackling loudly) - (all groaning) Joan: Sorry. Not a bad idea, Flu-liet. (hip-hop music playing) Much better. Ooh, what's this one do? Can I help you? Yes, it seems there's been a terrible oversight, and someone forgot to stock the minibar. We'll have to make a pit stop at the closest corner store. Apologies for my friend. No need to make a pit stop. Driver: Let me know if there's anything I can do to make your ride more enjoyable. Austin: You know, you don't have to hassle him like that. He's just trying to keep us safe. Don't be such a weenie. He's a chauffeur, not our babysitter. No, it's not that, okay? It's actually this. Yeah. I just don't want him to bust us. Since when were you so cool? You planned this? What about my mom? You promised. It's just a little taste. So we can have at least one toast to celebrate. Are you mad at me? No, of course not. Okay, because, uh, there's actually another thing. I arranged for one more surprise along the way, and we're headed there now. I thought we were stopping for dinner reservations before the school. A little change of plans. You're going to love it. All right, bottoms up, everybody. To a night we'll never forget. Cheers. ♪ (man rapping indistinctly) ♪ So, where exactly are we going? You'll see. I've got it all under control. We're not going to be late, right? My mom's expecting us by eight. Come on, don't worry. She trusts me. You say that like she shouldn't. Just believe me, I've planned for everything. We're almost there. Where are we? Uh, I thought, before we head to the big party, we could have our own little party right here. Where we had our first date. (laughing) You know, to celebrate the beginning of the rest of our lives. Austin. You're amazing. Let's party! Luke: Yes. (laughing) That's what I'm talking about. One sec. Hey. Thanks for inviting me tonight, Kimber. If it wasn't for you, I'd be sitting at home playing backgammon with my grandparents. (laughing) You've always been a really good friend. We were Girl Scouts together. (laughing) I miss you. I feel like we don't even get to see each other anymore. You sure you don't want a sip? Sometimes I wish I could be more like her. (laughing) Maybe I'd see you more. Hey, that's not fair. We have a lot going on, like school and college applications... (laughing) 'Tis a beautiful eve, m'dear. Why dost thou waste it sitting down? - Now dip me. - Okay, okay. See? I did pay attention in English class. (Everleigh chuckling) Uh, may I? Okay. What's up with Flu-liet? Is she feeling sick again? Tell her I have some antacids in my purse. Everleigh, don't call her names like that. It's not nice. Fine. Whatever. I was getting tired of this song anyways. Oh, Lukey! Could you change the music to something we could slow-dance to? That I can do. (mellow music playing) That's better. Now come here, you big lug, and give your boo a squeeze. Whatever you say.

We have to have a picture to commemorate the moment. Stop! No pictures. Not with any alcohol visible. Dude, it's not a big deal. You're not the one who gets busted if your parents find out. You think I don't know you snuck a bottle in? Well, man, I'm 21. And still dating high school girls. You should be proud. Come on, man. She's 18. Okay, everyone back in the car. I'm taking you home. What? No! You can't do that. You knew the rule. Austin: Come on, please. You know, we're sorry, okay? It's all my fault. Is there anything we can do? I'll add it to the tip. Look, I can let you have your fun... But you'll have to give up your phones. You want our phones? I'd rather give up my spleen. That's the deal. No pictures, no phones.

Anyone got any guesses where we're going? Or why? Dying on prom night. What a tragic cliché. Nobody's dying. Nobody's getting hurt. Luke: This guy went through a lot of trouble to kidnap us. Doubt we're getting out of here without a fight. You think we've been kidnapped? Probably for ransom. Maybe worse. Hell, maybe for some big, stupid prank. Whatever it is, we have to find a way out of here before we get to where this guy's going. - (grunting) - What are you doing? Luke: What's it look like, Tina Fey? Getting us the hell out of here. Anyone have a screwdriver? Wait. He could be watching us. Hey, how do you know about this stuff? Took auto shop in high school. The only class I didn't hate. - Oh. - Joan: Think you can open it? Maybe. Worth a shot. - But what if he stops again? - We have to do something. Luke: I found it! I just need something to loosen the screw. Kimber: Oh. What about this? I was... Well, I was going to keep that. I'll buy you a new one. I never should have come out tonight. I never belonged here in the first place. It's going to be okay, Joan. Or maybe we all end up dead. Why do you always have to do that, Everleigh? Take something sweet and make it sour? At least I'm not the one riding fifth wheel for my senior prom. Everleigh! Joan deserves to be here just like everyone else. Really? Because that's not what you told me the other day when your mother made you invite her. Joan: Is that true, Kimber? She may have suggested it. But I was going to ask you anyways. Luke: If you girls are done, I'm stuck. My hand's too big.

Um, look, I'm going to forward you a text, okay? So just check your messages. Shawna: Okay, you're scaring me. Shawna, just check your message. What is this? Why would someone send this to you? I don't know. I just tried calling them back, but the line's dead. She promised me. That tracking app you mentioned, is that working right now? Shawna: No, I was trying to give her some privacy. Hold on. Looks like she's in the middle of nowhere. Paul: What about this boyfriend in shining armor? Isn't he supposed to be with her? Yeah, he's supposed to be. When I get my hands on him, I swear... Shawna, you're the principal. You can't do that. I'm the dad. That's my job. What was I thinking? She had me so convinced I could trust her.

(limo door closing) - Quick, get the panel back on. - I almost have it. Joan: He's here, Kimber. There's no time. What are you doing? My boyfriend dropped his boutonniere. Got tired of you watching us, perv. Yeah, what are we, your prisoners? You two. Out. Austin: No. No, no. No one is going anywhere until you tell us what the hell is going on. I said out. - Hey! - Leave her alone! (electricity crackling) (all screaming) You can cooperate... Or you can be incapacitated. Your choice. That's no choice. Kimber: Okay, I'll just go. Why does Joan have to? - Kimber, no! - Driver: Both of you. Now. Now! Wait. This is my dad's building. What are we doing here? I need you to get something for me. I'm not getting anything for you. Not until you tell me what's going on. You're brave, Kimber, but you're picking the wrong time. I won't do it. Not until... Okay! Okay! Stop! Okay, I'll do it! This will all be over soon. I need you to go inside and open your father's office safe. What safe? Don't play games, Kimber. How do you know I know how to open it? Because your dad trusts you. Just like your mom. Just like your friends. It's locked. No outgoing calls, except to my phone. I want you to call this number right now. (cell phone ringing) You'll keep it on speaker the entire time you're inside. If I hear whispering, I hear anything I don't like, they'll find that limo at the bottom of a lake filled with the corpses of your friends. Are we clear? You have 10 minutes, then I'm gone. But what happens when they find the security footage of me breaking into my dad's safe in a prom dress? You can worry about that when you all wake up alive tomorrow. You have nine minutes.

Yeah, well, Kimber never got that screw. That probably wouldn't have worked anyway. Yeah, well, I think I almost got it. Look, when Ted Bundy comes around and goes to the door... I'm gonna jump him. You know what? Nah, that's too risky, man. And what about Kimber and Joan? We come back with reinforcements. Cops. Parental figures. Damn it! (sighing) I'm not even close on this thing. Okay, we're inside. (keypad beeping) (lock tumbling) You need to look for a bag to put the money in. Driver: Don't bother. If you don't want the money, then what do you want?

I made sure of it. Well, I hate to break it to you, but there is. (breathing heavily) Driver: Two minutes, ladies. (pencil scratching) Kimber: Wait. Hold on. Okay. The GPS says she's still in the same spot she was three hours ago. Paul, do you think she'll hate us if we come looking for her? This night was supposed to be all about her.

This is everybody's phone. Where is our daughter? Hey, we're gonna find her. Where is she? Who's calling me? Who is it? It's the office. Paul McCann. Mr. McCann, it's Jacob at the office. I think you need to get here right away. It's about your daughter. Are you sure you're okay? I'm fine. I'm more worried about her. Everleigh, I'm so sorry. This thumb drive he wanted you to steal, what did it look like? What does it matter? Why is it worth Luke dying over? It was just like any other thumb drive, but different. It had more buttons and a screen. Like a crypto wallet? A what? It's like a physical wallet, only it holds access to cryptocurrency. What? Not all of us have our parents to pay our way through college. I have been researching alternatives. Does that sound like something your dad would be into? Well, I know he didn't trust banks. So if he has the drive, he has your dad's money. He still needs the passcode. Which explains why he's holding all of us hostage. Us? He just needs you, doesn't he? What happens to the rest of us? I just wish you could've gotten that door open while we were all inside. Do you still think you can get that screw out? What do you mean? I got it out. I gave it to... What the hell? Why didn't you tell us? Well, I just had my nervous system jump-started, okay? And I wasn't about to abandon Kimber and Joan. That wasn't your decision to make! I'm just trying to keep everyone safe. Screw that! We could have had a chance to escape. Luke could have had a chance. Joan: Guys... (breathing heavily) I think I'm having... She's having an asthma attack. - (coughing) - Okay. Okay, just take deep breaths. Stay calm. In and out. (labored breathing) I need my... Kimber: Hey! We need that inhaler! No, she can't answer her phone, because I found it abandoned in the middle of the woods. And now there's a hostage note. Just send a detective here right away. Please hurry. Any luck with that limo? No response. - Take a look at this. - (mouse button clicking) I didn't know you had cameras in here. Paul: Oh, no, no. Oh, no. Paul? (keypad beeping) Shawna: What is it? What'd they take? Paul: Oh, my God. They didn't take the cash? They, um... (laughing) They, uh... They took everything. Shawna, they took everything I've ever worked for. (thumping on partition) (breathing heavily) Is she going to be okay? Just try relaxing, Joan. Try lying back. No. Keep her standing up. Please! I am begging you! She's my friend. She'll die without her inhaler! Everleigh: Breathe. Thank you. (inhaler hissing) (sighing) (coughing) Kimber: Everleigh! Everleigh! I've got it! Pull! Pull! Give me the drive or I'll close the partition on her throat! Just give it to him! Everleigh: There! Let her go! (yelling) I can't get her contact list open. I don't know who to call next. Um, Shawna, I, uh... This is not the best time, but there's something I've been meaning to tell you for a while now. Okay. After our divorce was finalized, I got my annual physical, and my lab results came back with some abnormalities. So I saw a couple specialists. It turns out that I have cancer. Prostate cancer. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't want to worry you or Kimber, and my doctor is very optimistic. And with everything we've been doing, so far so good. Paul, you should've told us. We could have helped. Well, look, things have been kind of strained between you and I for a while. Um, the whole family, really. And, uh, I just didn't want to add to that. It took two of us to let things get as bad as they did. - (Paul laughing) - I'm as guilty as you are. Well, I don't think so. But, uh, thank you for saying that. (knocking on window) - Hi. Detective Gosselin. - Paul: Hi. - You're Paul? - Paul: Yes. And Shawna. You called about a missing teen? You okay? We stopped. Because we pissed him off. We saw what he did to Luke. It could be any of us next. When he opens the door, we have to fight. We don't have a choice. Austin: Look, I messed things up, all right? Just let me fix this, okay? (car alarm chirping) Kimber: Austin! Austin! Austin: See? - Austin? - Hold on. I'm gonna get us out of here. Where'd the driver go? Kimber: Stop! Stop it! Austin! Austin! Austin! Austin! Austin! Where's Austin? What did you do to him? He wasn't good enough for you. You'll understand that one day. Anyone else feeling brave? What about you? Leave her alone! (crying) Don't cry. You're too beautiful to cry. Don't touch me! (vehicle approaching) (police sirens blurting) Don't say anything, or you'll end up like the guys. - Evening, officer. - Evening. Everything all right? Oh, yeah. Of course. We're all fine. Just, uh, stopped to stretch my legs. It's been a very busy night. I think I know what's going on here. What do you mean? It's prom tonight, isn't it? No shenanigans going on, I hope? Everyone behaving themselves? The truth is, officer, one of my passengers had a bit too much to drink tonight. - Oh. - I had to pull over just so I didn't get my seats stained. Ugh. We were just heading out. God, I swear, every year the kids get a little bit wilder. May I? Uh, sure. Scare 'em straight. Everybody okay in here? You sure you're okay, young lady? Well, uh... You kids have a good night. Make sure you get these kids home safe, okay? Of course. - (grunting) - (Taser crackling) (grunting) (all gasping) We have to run. Now! No! He'll kill us! (yelling) I told you to cooperate! Blood is on your hands. (police radio squawking) (dog barking distantly) (police sirens blaring) Gosselin: All right, so she was out with four of her friends, headed to prom? Yes. They rented a limo. We tried contacting the company, but got no response. Yeah. Look, Kimber would never leave her phone behind. I don't think any of them would. So obviously, something's happened to them, right? I mean, kids can get a bit wild on a night like tonight. My daughter is in danger. Just asking questions, ma'am. Show him the video. Yeah. Take a look at this. Has your daughter ever been in trouble like this before? Shawna: No. Kimber is a good kid. She wouldn't be doing any of this if someone wasn't forcing her to. Hey, look at the note. Obviously she is being held hostage. All right. Tell me more about this boyfriend she's out with, Austin? Kimber: He killed him. He just killed him. Joan: I'm so sorry, Kimber. Austin was... Kimber: He died trying to save us. Just like Luke. What are you going to do to her? Please get out of the car, Kimber. Now. Sit. Sit! Are you going to kill me now? Austin: No. No one else has to die. Austin? You're alive! (sighing) I don't understand. You're with him? Austin: Well, someone had to keep an eye on you, make sure you all behaved. Make sure my brother here didn't lose his nerve. Brother? Why do you think I started dating you? Earning your trust? It was all leading here. Why? What do you want? Who are you, Austin? What is this? This is the day the truth comes out. The day Paul McCann finally faces the consequences of his actions. My dad? What does my dad have to do with any of this? Everything. Play that from the beginning again, Paul. Yeah. (mouse button clicking) (cell phone ringing) It's a video message from the same number that sent me the last one. (cell phone continues ringing) Who the hell is this? Hello, Principal McCann. Austin? Where are you? Where's Kimber? Is she okay? I promised Kimber a night to remember. And I think I've kept that promise. Austin, what's going on? - Kimber: Mom! Dad! - Driver: Hey! Hey, hey, hey. I swear to God, if you hurt her, I... Save your threats, Paul! You're the reason she's here. So if you do what's right, she lives. What? Who are you? Grace? Grace Adams. You remembered. You're her son? Well... sons, actually. Dad, what's he talking about? - Paul, who's Grace Adams? - (stammering) (crickets chirping) Well, are you going to explain, Paul, or should I? Paul: What is it you want? You want money? This is about... You want my money? Austin: I want exactly two things, Paul. I want the passcode to the crypto wallet I stole, and I want you to finally tell your family the truth. Shawna: Paul? What? Shortly before we divorced... I told you about that affair. Um, well, it was more than an affair. Her name was Grace. No, tell her what happened. Paul: I ended things with Grace, and not long after that, she died. No, she didn't, Paul! My mother didn't die. You killed her! No, no, no, no. She died from an overdose. That was not my fault, okay? She had demons way before I met her, okay? I tried to help her. Help her? You abandoned her. You lied to her about your family, and that betrayal killed her. Paul: No, no, no. I... I told her it was a fling, and she knew that. You told her you loved her. So you want money? Paul doesn't even have that much money. So you've been lying about that too, Paul? All that money. Money that could have paid for therapy. Money that could have paid for medication. Money that could have saved my mom. - What? - Austin: No, go on. Tell her how much you're really worth. Paul: Millions. I'm worth millions. Now, Paul, you'll give me access to those millions. No, no, no, stop. Okay, stop! Okay, okay! I will give you the code. (sobbing softly) I'm ready. 51227924. (beeping) (computer beeping) Pleasure doing business with you, Paul. Paul: No, no, wait! Hey! What about Kimber? I need backup on the scene, ASAP. Shawna. Shawna. When I got my diagnosis, I was so scared that I would leave you guys with nothing. So I got aggressive with my investments, and it paid off. It paid off big-time. Okay? So that money is meant for you and Kimber. If anything happens to her, Paul, I swear I will never forgive you. Do you hear me? I will never forgive you! (computer beeping) What are you doing? Making a deposit. Courtesy of your dad. (laughing) I grieved for you. I thought you were dead. You said you loved me. Austin: I really do like you, Kimber. I think you're a great girl. It's just your bloodline that sucks. - (computer stops beeping) - Let's load up. - Got that? - Yeah. - Okay. - Let's go. Austin: All right. (door opening and closing) (grunting) (car alarm chirping) Kimber. Kimber! Shh! They're just outside. - Everleigh: "They"? - Austin and the driver. They're working together. What? Why? How? No. Just leave me here. You have to make a run for it. - No way. You're coming too. - There's nowhere to go. We're in the middle of nowhere. But he doesn't know you're free yet, okay? So just leave me here and go. Joan: We're not leaving you, Kimber! You have to. Go. He left his phone. He has my dad's number. Send him my location, okay? Hurry! Hide! (door closing) (breathing heavily) - (grunting) - Driver: Kimber? Did you call for me? Do you need anything? Water? Are you hungry? Kimber: You have what you were after. You have to let us go. We have to help her. I can't. I'm sorry. We have to wait. Help is coming. Are you really Austin's brother? He's my brother. But I'm not like him. Obsessed like him. So then why are you doing this? Because he's the only family I have left. I'm sorry. It's not your fault. You're innocent in all this. Tonight was supposed to be your special night. But you never even got the chance to have your first dance. (breathing heavily) (crickets chirping) ♪ May I have this dance? In case we don't make it through this, Joan, I'm sorry for how I treated you. The teasing, the names. I understand why Kimber thinks so highly of you. Why you're her friend. This is nice. Maybe when this is all over, we could all hang out together sometime. Don't push it. Who's "Everleigh"? It's Kimber's location! Maybe she got away! Do not reply. We don't know who sent that. I'm not waiting. Listen, additional units are downstairs. I got to get these guys up to speed. Wait here. All good. On my way. - I'm done waiting. Let's go. - Yeah. They can catch up to us on the road. I can't see them behind us. You think we should slow down? If I wanted your input, Paul, I'd ask for it. Okay. Hold on, baby. I'm coming. Driver: My brother never understood what he had with you. All he cares about is revenge. And what do you care about? I care about you, Kimber. Ever since that first night we met. The party. That was you. After we failed the first time, we started watching you. Getting to know you. Coming up with a better plan. I'm so sorry, Kimber... For hurting you. My real name is Emerson. Emerson. There's still time to let us go. Austin? - You liar! - Hyah! Driver: You shouldn't have done that. (grunting) (groaning) (gasping) Kimber, get in the car! (limo doors closing) You guys okay? Keys. Buckle up. (ignition starts) Austin: Emerson, what's taking so long? This is about to get bumpy. (car alarm chirps) No! No! No! No! No! Everleigh: Get out of the car! Kimber! (all panting) Austin: You know, my mom didn't get to teach me a whole lot, but she did teach me one thing. Always have a spare. Austin, you got what you wanted. Just drive away. Nobody will follow you. Why can't you just let this go? I can't let this go. (all scream) No! - Oh, my God! - Mom! Mom! Shawna: Oh, my God. - (sighs) - Kimber: Dad! Hey. Kimber: I knew you guys would find me. - Oh, there was never any doubt. - You girls okay? Yeah? The police are on their way. Shawna: You poor things. (police sirens wailing) You okay, honey? I think so. Hey, look what I found. - (laughs) - It's a little worse for wear, but it still works, believe it or not. My phone. How'd you find it? That is a story for another day. (laughs) ♪ - Let's go home. - Kimber: Okay. Yeah. ♪ ♪
