- Already leaving? - Yeah, I have to be somewhere. - Still on for tomorrow morning? - Of course. - Give me a call anyway. You never know. - I will. Yes? - Does Vincent Lamar work here? - Yes. But I'm sorry, he just left. Oh well. I'll wait for him. He's not coming back. Not until tomorrow, anyway. He's a friend of yours? You've known him for long? We work together. We've known each other forever. Did you know he's a monster? No. I didn't. Absolutely not. No. Is there something I should tell him? You don't know him that well, do you? I live in Paris now. I'll be back. Miss! - What's that? - What's that? Listen to him! That's for your birthday, my boy. My birthday is in April, Dad. Oh, that's right. I always get it mixed up with your mother's. And you didn't say anything? No, Raoul. You know very well that I mind my own business. Oh, it doesn't matter. It can wait. There's no risk of it going out of style before April. What's wrong? I'll tell you later. - Is she here? - No. - Let me see. - But you don't know her. How would you know? Either she's mad, or it's a prank. - It's not a toy, is it? I mean, her... - Doesn't look like it, no. - So? All clear? - Yeah. - Good. Shall we go? - Yes, maestro. Let's go. - Hello, Marcel. How are you? - Good. I can't find the time to take care of my own. And my answering machine keeps hanging up on people. I must have missed a ton of dubbing gigs. They left at two in the morning. I've got such a headache. And naturally, Patrice's wife came home. Here, look. Take special care of these ones. Patrice is the one with the black fingernails? Why are you so mean? Be a nice girl. Buttons always go missing. That little statue is new, isn't it? Yeah. Christophe brought it back from Mexico. - And who's that? - A friend. A friend-friend? Or a friend-friend-friend...? Both. - The 2CV is his? - Yes. He's a sound engineer. He's pretty good at his job and he irons his own shirts. It takes all sorts. Vincent, I want a divorce. Again? Doesn't this suit us both? You see? It's the only place where you can dance without an ulterior motive. Maybe for you, but what about her? That... is none of my business. Still on for tonight? I can't, but Albert is free. No, no. I told Dominique I'd come home. There you have it, my dear. We can't help you. - Alright. - Two minutes. Take your places, everyone. Shall we go? Shit. - Mr Vincent Lamar? - Yes? He wrecked my sister. Vincent! - Is she gone? - Yes. You're not hurt, are you? What do you mean, not hurt? Look. I'll never play again. Cut the crap! - That's just a scratch. - A scratch? That's right. In which case... No kidding. - What's all this now? - It sounded like gunshots. Did someone catch her? - Who? - Forget it, Albert. Some crazy woman! She shot at us. Man, oh man... What? There's nothing to see. Go on, get out. Get out. Go on, beat it! What's all this about now, Lamar? - Some more of your antics? - Is there no alcohol here? - No! No, Albert, no alcohol. Can't you go and get shot somewhere else, Lamar? She won't be back. I promise. I'll take care of it. I'll tell the others it was just a prank, alright? - Sure, yeah. - Well, "sure, yeah"... - Such bullshit... - Who was that girl? I don't know. I don't know. - What? - Nothing. I was thinking about you. "It's not a toy, is it?" She could have killed you, you know. That sister she mentioned, you don't know her either? How should I know? Here's one. Her face wasn't familiar? Yes, vaguely. Well... I don't know. I'd better take you home. What exactly did she tell you, on that first day? Nothing. That you're a monster. Does it hurt? - Want me to come up? - No, no, no. Funny, I've never come up to your place. - Ah? - I never have. Albert. - Did Janvion throw a fit? - What do you think? - You could have let me know. - That's the thing. I can't anymore. - What? - I'm dead. What are you talking about? Was she in the room tonight? - No. - There you go. As far as she knows, I'm dead. I am dead. And I intend to remain so. Well? Do you like my place? It's not bad. I'm scared. Come on. Search a little harder! It could also be a mistake. You know, "seek and ye shall find". You ought to seek a little, sometimes. But you're the one she shot at! Tomorrow, it could be you. Go figure! A madwoman with a revolver... You're going to see him? - So he's still in hiding? - Yeah. She could come back. Her or somebody else. Somebody else? Come now, Albert... You know him as well as I do. I think you've been the third wheel long enough. I pulled through, you see? But... others did not come out unscathed. He's charming, you know? Yes. But to get killed over that... Not all of them have a sister. Do I have a sister, Albert? - No. - Yes I do. You see? Have you replaced him? No, no yet. The thing is, he's a good player when he's in the mood. It's his hand. It's still in bad shape. Can he play or not? Not yet. Obviously, if this goes on... - You'll replace him? - Well, yeah. I see. It won't be easy. Let's not exaggerate. There's good players who are out of work. Can't disagree with you there. Albert. Come check this out. - What is that? - She's got to be one of them. - Whoa! How far back did you go? - As far as possible. What's for dinner tonight? Roast beef and mashed potatoes. Chantal, Corinne, Monique, Sonya, Mich... - There's so many! - I know. It sickens me. How do you even find the time? Mind you, not all of them mattered or lasted very long. There's some on the back too? My, oh my, oh... I'm not proud of that, you know. All of them have a sister? Er, no. No, certainly not. This is such bullshit. It bums me out. You want a yogurt? Yes. Laurence Panet, Claire Deschamps, Sybilla... Marion Schuster, Gabrielle Voltaire... Danielle, Lucienne, Claude, Dominique... Ève... What are you doing? You're not sleeping? What is that? - The women you've known? - Yes. So many! I don't know a single one. And Dominique? Dominique is not on there? Because I'm the only one that matters. Obviously. Obviously. Do you think your dad is making fun of me? Makes you dream, doesn't it? I've been working with Vincent for twenty years. We grew up together. I don't know one tenth of these. That's friendship for you. - Mr. Palm? - Yes? There was a lady who asked for Mr. Vincent. I told her he is indisposed. - What did she say? - Nothing. She just left. Thanks, Emile. Anyway, if it was her, she knows you're not dead. It's got to be her. I'll have to go out on the field. I'll have to meet her, so we can talk it over, clear up this misunderstanding. She's becoming ridiculous. Ridiculous. I'm suffocating in here! Suffocating! What did you say? Nothing. I'll make another list. - But this time, in order. - Alphabetical? No, no. Chronological. Only the ones with a sister. Only the ones who mattered. An irrefutable list. And then? What will you do? Well... That's where you come in. - Me? - Yes, you. You understand, don't you? I need a friendly perspective... Friendly, objective. You'll trace back my steps. Walk back into my past. Faithfully. With affection. Because I can't see anything but ghosts. You won't get tripped up by the wrinkles, the pounds they've put on, the years gone by... The gray hair... I can't. I just can't. - But I don't know them. - Exactly. - So what am I going to tell them? - Well... You'll have no shortage of options. You can tell them... that I'm dead, or that we lost touch, or that... you're the one who's about to die, and that... you want to see me one last time. You can't be serious. We're looking for one woman, not twenty. But how will you find her if you don't track down the others? My women are like a long chain. Each link is hooked to the next one. It's like a circle. The horror! Where should I start? At the end. - Nathalie? - No. Just before Nathalie. Marion. A lioness. The legs on her. She has huge blue eyes and... massive hair... 124, avenue de Suffren, just a step away from... your place. Yes? - May I please speak to Miss Marion Schuster? Speaking. Ah. Albert Palm. I am a friend of Vincent's. Vincent Lamar? Come in. I'm sorry. I absolutely have to find him. And I thought you might be able to help me. You know... I haven't seen Vincent in a long time. - Sit down, please. - I hope I'm not disturbing. Come in, Eric. What can I tell you about Vincent? I don't know. Come, Eric. You'll be surprised. To me, Vincent mattered both very little and very much. Very little on an affective level. I mean, he didn't fool me. But very much sexually. In that field, I owe him everything. I had huge problems, you know. A kiss for you! I was stuck, I couldn't do it. I was getting worked up inside my head. I couldn't do it. Do what? Get pleasure, as simple as that. Albert Palm... Jean-Philippe, my husband. - Delighted. - Hello. I'm a friend of Vincent's. Here. For example, he made me love my breasts. And I didn't like my breasts. I would hide them. See what I mean? Without Vincent, it's not clear that I would have breast-fed Eric. It's like my thighs: I used to find them short. But he said that's where his lever, his impulsion would spring up from. He would call them a Maillol piece, a king's collar. Now I find them wonderful. Isn't that right, Jean-Philippe? It all stems from there for him as well. May... may I ask you a rather delicate question? Did you know the woman with whom he shared his life before you? Poor old Claude? She'd call him at night, stake him out on the street... She wanted to marry him. I think she went back to Blois. Ah, Vincent... When you see him, tell him to come over for dinner. Will you? You can count on me. Well... - Thank you for... - Don't touch him! Hey, I left you the schedule for Blois on the table. There's the 10:30 and there's the express at noon, but you won't have time for that one. I also wrote down addresses for her parents. Both the shop and the apartment. For the way back, take the 17:30, or you'll miss the curtain. So you told him you wouldn't go? But I will. Why? Deep down, you're enjoying this, aren't you? Yes. It's moving. To see them after so many years. But you don't know them. They're not your women. Exactly. Some of them could have been. Chance, circumstances... - Yeah, and you stumbled upon me. - Fortunately. Because surely not all of them were fun to be with. I've got to help him. He's in danger. He would do the same for me. You think? Excuse me. Could you please tell me if Claude Piette is here? Claude? - There's a Mr... - Palm. Albert. Albert Palm. Yes, he wants to see you. - You way go upstairs. - Thank you. Piette, that's her maiden name. Who the hell is this guy? You're the conductor? Is Vincent sending you over? - Do we know each other? - I know you. Two things: I have nothing to say to Vincent, and I don't want to hear from him. I'm listening. Vincent is dead. - How? - An accident. And you came all this way to tell me that? Just like I'm telling all the women he loved. Loved? Are you joking? He did live here, right? Exactly. Six months with me, and that's being generous. - He spent the rest with Leclerc. - Leclerc? Patricia Leclerc. It didn't bring good luck to that poor girl. - Why? Because she's also dead. - Did she have a sister, this Patri...? - No... a brother, I believe. What are you getting at? - Vincent is dead. - How about that! We won't be seeing the 20,000 francs he stole from you any time soon. He was murdered. Four bullets in the belly. He was in agony for two days. It was some hysterical woman who disappeared. I swore I'd track her down. It will take as long as it needs. And what are we gonna do about the 20,000 francs? What do you think? We forget about them. Did you see the time? So what are we going to do about Vincent? We replace him. I'll go tomorrow morning. Yeah, I... I told Duclos to start. What can I tell you? Vincent disappeared. He's at the Luxa Hotel, Garibaldi boulevard. It's just around the corner. You know what this place needs? A cat. A cat? No thanks! - Did Vincent come here? - Yeah. He even asked for money. I lent him some. I changed rooms because of the noise. Three times. Someone phoned my place last night. Nothing on the other end, but there was someone. I could hear breathing. - A woman, you think? - Of course, a woman. So, what about Blois? Waste of time. One of them hates you, but is happy, and the other, Patricia, is dead. Don't rejoice. No sister. Patricia... Patricia. She had a bad heart, Patricia. Alright. So... Odette. There were four of them. Four sisters. I set a meeting for you tomorrow at Angelina's with Odette. Order a Mont Blanc. It'll make you feel sick, but you won't regret it. My poor Vincent! I might as well tell it like it is: I don't remember you at all. - No, but... - But I'm pleased to see you again. No, I'm a friend of Vincent's. Ah, you certainly had many friends. Guy, Louis, little Jean-Marc... With him, it lasted for two years. Two years. Him, I would recognize. And Albert, the little skinny one. I could've liked him but... It was hopeless. Do you mind? Oh, that's it! Of course. You're the one who played the violin. - No, trumpet. - That's it. Oh, I'm delighted. Did you know I got married? You'll never guess. With a stamp collector! One day I threw him out, with his tweezers, his albums, his canceled stamps, his stamps with missing teeth... What time is it? - Quarter to. - Ooh! My God, I'm late. - And your sisters? - I don't know. They had children. I was glad to see you again. Goodbye, dear! You know what? I wouldn't have recognized her. Neither would she have. You can cross her off the list. Alright. So... Strasbourg. Do you think a day trip is possible? What's in Strasbourg? My father. He might be able to help you. Go there on your day off. You'll have 48 hours. Take your wife along, if you like. What does you father have to do with this? Everything. You'll understand once you're there. What are you thinking of? Vincent. And? I don't know. You really don't want to come along to Strasbourg? No. That's your business. What have I got to do with any of that? Then I'm not going. What's happening with Vincent? A girl shot him at the theater. He's been hiding since then. He says he doesn't know her. It would seem she's the sister of one of his mistresses. Anyway, I'm looking for her. - Here? - Everywhere. We thought Spencer might be able to help us. I don't see why you came here. This is the address Vincent gave me. Aren't you his father's wife? Yes. It's been one year. But we've been together for years. Well... it's a little more complicated than that. And how is Nathalie? Does she still act? Yes. Well... Yes. To me, Irène is the only one who didn't land on her feet. The dancer? She ended up as a dresser at the opera. Yes. Irène and her friends, those sisters... No, please... I'm telling you. The Galetz sisters. You've got to go see them. And the cathedral, of course. You've never been to Strasbourg? Then the cathedral... and the Galetz sisters. Now tell me about my son. Aside from this whole story, he's doing well. - He hasn't changed. - Sadly. Gifted like you wouldn't believe, yet no ambition. Trumpet! There's no such thing as a musician with no ambition. Even if concessions must be made, in the end, what remains is the music, the red curtain, the show. And people who enjoy it. That depends on which side of the curtain you put yourself. When the curtain rises, you really get going, right? But Vincent keeps himself hidden behind his desk. As if behind a wall. No, I was dreaming of something else, Albert. A real entrance. In full view. According to our tradition. But Vincent would rather... hide away in a pit. Like a rat. So he can lead his... How can I put it? His crooked life. Mutedly. A gray curtain, Albert. A black curtain. You were wrong about the color. I'm coming. I aged quite a bit, didn't I? No, not at all. - How about Vincent? - Not really, no. - You would still like him. - Oh, I've always liked him. They all liked him. Impossible to hold a grudge against him. And the stuff he pulled on me! On all his girlfriends. But that's how it was. All in good fun. - Even for Maya? - Oh no. She had a hard time. - Does Maya have a sister? - Of course! Beatrice. A little bitch. And she's dangerous. A mean girl. - Where can we find Maya? - At her house! At this hour, she's still lucid. Say, you're on some kind of pilgrimage. Yes, in a way. I brought you Albert. You're so kind. Listen... I feel like we've turned the clock back twenty years. Look at yourself. She's so beautiful! It's funny. She can't resist alcohol. Alcohol mixed up with all that filthy cold medication she drinks. - Why? Is she ill? - No. You know, at our age, there's always something wrong. My back is always killing me. That's why I quit dancing. But make no mistake. I'm still supple. Shit! What are you doing here? Why did you come? You found her? No. She's not here. It's neither Maya nor Irène. - Shit. - You said it. - And Dad? Did you see him? - Yes. - And his wife? How is she? - Quite well. - She's beautiful. - You can say that again. - Where were you? - With Irène. I would have bet on Maya. You slept with them both? I'm not you, you know! Hurry up. - Huh? - Hurry up. - Who is it? - I don't know. - Yes? - It's Miléna. Er, yes. Your investigation is just a pretext. You know that? Not at all, no. Someone shot at him. I was there. So? Are you a cop? Here. You can have a look. Not a very good photo, right? Not a very good memory either. When is that from? It's been a while. Can't you see that? It was just before Spencer. It was Vincent who introduced us. Did you know that? And Spencer doesn't know? No, but he soon will if this goes on. If what goes on? The photos! Vincent is the one sending you photos? - I don't believe you. - Oh, he doesn't do it too often. Just every once in a while, whenever he feels like it. One day, he'll send one I won't be able to intercept. Tell him to stop, for God's sake! What does he even want? To screw things up between us? Is that it? Spencer is dear to me. I love him. I love him, I'm happy with him, and I make him happy. That's what that jerk realized. That's what he finds unbearable. That's not possible. He adores his father. When he speaks of you, he... Yeah. Here. Since that's all he's interested in, you should give it to him. But he has to stop! Shit. - Shall we kiss? - Yes. And then we'll make love, and your buddy will take photos. Is that it? How moving. Sordid, huh? Stupid, too. - She's the one I'm sending them to. - What for? You can be so touching. Oh, she's right. That photo's no good. So what do you think of the new guy? He's good. He plays a little too early, but it will work out pretty well. Say, I don't know which room to give him. Would it bother you if... No, not at all. He can use my dressing room. Until Vincent comes back, of course. How is he doing? Not too good. Something's up. There's something I don't understand. - Mr. Palm? - Yes? The lady from the other night who was asking for Mr. Vincent. Yes, what about her? She's waiting for you in the hall. Ah. Thank you. My name is Marie-Pierre. I'm one of the women Vincent knew, but you surely don't know about me. No one has ever known what had gone on between Vincent and I. - Who told you I was looking? - Marion did. Marion and Jean-Philippe. They sometimes call me over for the night. You sleep with them? I absolutely had to find you, and quickly. You're not going to hurt Vincent, at least? - How long ago was that? - It was at the same time as Nathalie. It lasted a while? - One time. - What do you mean, one time? I picked him up in a nightclub. He looked so lonely. We danced. Then I kissed him. It was so soft, it hurt. Then we left the club together. He told me I was pretty. That I reminded him of someone. I see. And then? We didn't even make love. He wanted to watch. To watch me. Do you understand? He told me in advance, "I won't touch you." He watched me so gently. With a mature detachment. As if he were observing an animal he loved. But I wasn't important. I was helping him pass the time. You wanted to see me to tell me that? Why are you here? Because he caused me no harm. Because he's innocent. You had better leave his life alone. And what do you know about his life? So what if I enjoy taking a stroll through his life? Is that any of your business? No, you're right. I shouldn't rub my eyes. I've been forbidden to do it. I've got this... Eye disease. I always look like I'm crying. There's no cure. Silly, huh? - Is it far? - What is? - To your place. - Yes. It's in the 15th. Why? My parents had an apartment there. It's was enormous. My room was all the way in the back. Whenever they went out in the evening, I'd turn all the lights on. They'd go out all the time. Dad worked for the ministry of justice in those days. I was so afraid that I'd have a classmate come over. Never the same boy. My parents never noticed a thing. Now, I prefer being alone. Oh yeah? No. That's not true. I get so scared that I whistle so I won't hear the silence. Where is your father now? Do you have a bit of money? On me? No. And at this hour... Do you want me to touch myself for you? Would that please you? No. No. I know. I'll give up. You didn't find anything there? I did. But not what I was looking for. There's too many of them. And it's too complicated. And not everyone is happy with that. Why? Did you get yelled at? Among other things. You know what I think? In a sense... Anyone of them could have shot him. - What did you think? - Not that. You worry me, you know. You're not getting mixed up in all of that, are you? Of course not. What bothers you is the idea of losing Vincent. I'm tired, that's all. Hi. I put my things over there. Sure, sure... Er... actually, you did the right thing. Vincent used to put them there. - Yes? - Mr. Palm, telephone for you. I've left the hotel. I was out of clean shirts, had nothing to eat, and I was cold. I came back home. Are you giving up on me? - How was it tonight? - Oh, the usual. First of all, I wanted to tell you... I've replaced you. Who with? Gérard André. A good one, mind you. I heard you gave him the dressing room. Oh, no, please. - Have dinner with me? - No. No. I told Dominique I was coming home. You don't have the right! What right? To give up on me! You must go further! All the way. It's either too late or too soon. Some of them really loved me. Think about it! Vengeance can only come from someone who still loves me. There she is. Eléonore. Even I really loved her. Does she have a sister at least? Yes, and she's younger. It fits. Sure. Go find her. Alone? So I can get killed? - How would my presence change anything? - Then we'll both get killed. What the hell is she doing here? She's a waitress at the beach snack bar. That's during the season, but right now there's not a soul around. That's true, but... There it is. Hello. - You guys work for the credit union? - Yes. - No. If it's for the Steiner sisters, they're still here. It won't be easy. Bungalow E4, all the way down. Seaside. The most humid spot. I guess they don't give a damn! - Are you going? - What about you? Later, if necessary. Ah, it's quarter to. Time for the 1000 Francs Game. Hello, dear friends. Green peas, beans... - Are you from the credit union? - No, no. Not at all. My name is Albert Palm. Cute name. I suppose you don't get into too much trouble with a name like that. The next credit union guy that shows up, I'll stick this right in his stomach. Please have a seat. Are you Eléonore? I've come about Vincent. No peeping. Especially since I'm not Eléonore. Then you're... her sister Séverine? That's right. What about the handsome Vincent? No, not handsome. Better than that. He's ill. Very ill. And... he asked? He asked to see Eléonore? No... The fact is, he's delirious. He's saying people's names, he's... He's worried. He's going over his past. And I'm doing my best. You're lucky to have found me. Ah? Why is that? Why? You know... She was... She was crazy about him. She was... sick. She believed anything he'd say. In everything he did. And God knows he pulled some stuff on her. But... it was never enough. Never. Poor Eléonore. She humiliated herself for him. Debased herself. Prostituted herself for him. - No? - Yes. Twice. Very important guys. He needed it, and... All of it for a record. His LP on ICA? Oh, but... Make no mistake. It was quite a stack. I'll show you. She would listen to it all day long. He was such a good player. Don't you like it? Clearly, music isn't your thing, is it? Vincent, now he was a good dancer. She could stay like this for hours. In his arms. It was better than making love. And you? You'd watch them? I'm about to say something stupid. Weren't you a bit in love with him? Oh, no. How is this any of our business? We know nothing, but want to make sense of everything. I'm sorry. But... It would be better for her to never see Vincent again, because... Especially if he's ill. She got out of it, you understand? Well... Not on her own, but... With this. And all the rest. Go away. Go away! Oh. I won't tell Eléonore that you came. I won't tell her. Ah, there he is. May I present Séverine, Eléonore's... Sister, I know. You didn't tell Eléonore that he's here, did you? No, no. Don't worry. You see, Séverine thinks it's best if I don't see her. - How is she doing? - Well. Very well. She only spoke of you. She did? Well then, it's done. We saw both of them. She didn't talk about me at all? Not a word. Isn't that enough? No? Yes. You see, when you stir up the past... It's always the bad stuff that come up. Whatever's good stays at the bottom. Why? Because it's heavier? - Isn't that how it goes for you? - No. I want to play again. Janvion signed the new guy on until the end of the show's run. Best case, you can start rehearsals again for the next one. Just tell me right now if I've been sacked. You haven't. You can come back for rehearsals. Say, watch out for those trombones in the second scene. They throw you off every time. Yeah, I've noticed. I'll start earlier. One minute. We're on. - You'll come by tomorrow? - If I can, yeah. Are you OK? Dammit, she'll end up wasting me! She's nuts. I missed, didn't I? Give me that. You're completely mad. That would suit you just fine. Let's go to your place to pick up some things. Come to my house. She's got guts, I must say. He's scared stiff, isn't he? With good reason. And it makes you laugh? Yes, because when I met him, he was already running away from crazy women. He's always attracted the hysterical ones. - What about you? You're not hysterical? - No, I'm not! That's why nothing ever happened between him and I. But it almost did. Almost, yes. But you came into the picture. For once, I came in at the right time. Exactly. "Albert... "I've decided to go underground. "I'll keep you posted. "Kisses, Vincent." Are you awake? Here you are. Well then, shall we go see Janvion? - It won't cause trouble, right? - Are you kidding? OK, so takedown is on Wednesday. I'm giving you a whole week off. Lighting on the 14, dancers rehearse on the 16 and 17... and the orchestra on the 19. - That's a Sunday. - It is. On the 20, then. - Is that good with you? - Yes. I'm keeping Gérard. For the rehearsals. You are? I see. Is that new? Yes. That's new. Are you sure it's not going to cause problems? There is no problem. Nathalie! He didn't come pick up his shirts. Where has he gone? Vanished. Have a seat. I came today because I had dubbing gigs all week. - That's great. - Yeah. And... and Vincent? Vincent, my dear Nathalie, you may have to go without for a while. He has other fish to fry. Listen up. You've got an interesting little job. At your age, you can have more ambition. Ironing shirts... You'll have to put Vincent behind you. Way behind. - But he's the one who won't divorce me. - Oh please! How long has he been gone? - Three, three and a half years. - So? Nowadays, divorce papers write themselves. Even if the other party doesn't want to. Spousal abandonment? Sure, but isn't that a bit mean? Of course not! It will do him a great service. Him more than you. Vincent is in trouble, Nathalie. He needs to be alone so he can start again from scratch. And I'm in the way? No. But you're slowing him down. He will not dare go forward, either in his life, or in his career. And Vincent isn't built to carry too much baggage with him. - Will you still give him the shirts? - I will. I'll also feel better afterward. - I met someone. - Oh! - He's very fond of me. - Keep going straight ahead, Nathalie. Live your life, your real life. And Vincent... I'll always be there to help him bounce back. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight... One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... And one, and two, and three, and four, five, six, seven, eight... And one, and two, and three, and four, five, six, seven, eight... One, two, three, contract! One, two, three, contract! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... OK, two minutes. Two-minute break. Why did you give me the new girl? Hey listen, that's what you asked me. - Impossible. She's awful. - In any case, she's all we have. We'll switch the places up. Wait, we'll switch the places up. Corinne, come and see. We need to rehearse a little more. Let's resume. OK? Start the music. Susie, be a nice girl and pay attention. In the last bar, you're late to turn around. One and two, three and four, shoulders, shoulders... One and two, three and four, shoulders, shoulders... One, two, three, contract. One, two, three, four. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Come on, wiggle those hips! OK. That's good. Mélanie, you're late. Do you want my opinion? I think it'll be even crazier than the last one. One, two, three, contract! I hear the juggler is good. "I found her. Come quick. "Mom will be thrilled to see you again. Vincent." It's from La Ciotat. You see? You'll never get rid of him. It's not complicated. Just don't go! But of course he'll go. Thank you. And here you are, back to square one. It's like you're playing the Game of the Goose. La Ciotat, cradle of your friendship. Don't forget your bathing trunks. Are you about finished? - Admit that it moves you. - It doesn't! I'm curious. And I suppose a lot has changed over there. Surely. Your little gang must've gotten a lot older. Grey or beige? La Ciotat... Be careful with the white one. Alright, Mom, I'm going. - Does Albert like rabbit? - Albert likes everything. Here I am. Is it your first time coming back? Yes, it's my first time. You know, you've hardly changed, Albert. I recognized you right away. I never would have thought such a friendship could exist. Thirty-five years. And you were always arguing. - Thank you. - Which shows... None of it means anything. Thank you, Mom. Is Vincent a good worker, at least? Yes, a very good one. - Do you have children? - No. You don't either? What is it with you two? We've got a meeting at five. - Where? - At Café de I'Univers. Young Bruno is the one managing it now. - Who are we meeting? - You'll see. Mom, your rabbit's really good, you know. Alright, listen. What's all this? Wait. There. Right on time. There she is. - And? - That's her. - Who? - Amalia. Amalia Rondi? - Our little Italian girl? - The brown-haired siren. Look carefully. Isn't that a broken person? She had a sister? Yes, but she's much younger. That's her here... here... and here. There she is, Amalia. My God, was she pretty. Look, there he is. How did it go? - Go for it, Rémi. - No. She asked for Vincent. What about the kid sister? I don't remember her. She was four years old. She wasn't with us often, except on that day. It was there, on the right. - Are you sure? - Certain of it. In any case, what I know is that... It was a beautiful day. You were on the other side with Bruno. I was at the base of the rock. There was also Patrick... Manuel... And, wait... Jean-Marie. Where was the little girl? On the beach, with Josiane looking after her. Come on! We all did it. - Jump! - Come on, jump! Do it! - Come on, over here! - Come on, jump! Quick! Come on! Come on, jump! - The water's good! - Come, Amalia! - Go on, jump! Come on, Amalia! Come on, jump, you wimp! Are you scared? We all did it. Come on over here. - Jump, quick! - Come on, I'm telling you! - Come on! - Are you scared or what? - Jump! - Chicken! - Over here! - Vincent, don't let her! - No! - No! I'm the one she wanted to jump toward. Except I wasn't in the right spot. But we all shouted for her to jump. But she would only listen to me. She only wanted me. The previous night, at the cabin, she told me her dream. It was to marry me. Do you realize? Me? That's not how I wanted her. Not just for me. She didn't want us anymore. I know. At first, I was quite proud of that, but then... Later... I began to find her clingy. I liked it when we shared her among ourselves. - What was the kid's name? - I don't know. It was so long ago. What are you going to do now? Talk to Amalia, if I have the courage to. Why not talk to her sister? - You don't know where she is? - I do, I do. She's in Paris. She's been an usher at the Rex for a year. We all told her to jump. Hey. Did you keep Gérard André on for the new show? Yes. You did the right thing. - See you. - See you. So what's her name? Léa. Did you have trouble finding her? No. I waited at the door. She came out with the others. Excuse me. How does all this stuff you told me change anything? It changes something in that it was an accident. It wasn't Vincent's fault more than anyone else's. Is she pretty? Rather so, yes. - But he's the one she loved. - Yes, but... Come on. For years, she didn't say anything. She was waiting for me to grow up. Then one night, she told me about the accident, just like you did. About how her life ended on that day. Little by little, I realized he needed to be punished. That being said, I hesitated for a long time. You see, she still loves him. So I thought... If he was dead... She'd be better placed to love him. He loved her, too. Vincent loves his women. Poorly, not for long. But he loves them. And you? Did you love him? I've long asked myself why he'd sent me into his past. It wasn't just because of fear. I think deep down, he wanted to know if... for once, he could be loved for who he is. And you can't. - You must meet Vincent. - No. - Let him explain himself. - No! No, no, no. - I'll tell you where he is. - No! I only saw Vincent one more time, by chance, on my day off. We came to get Léa. She's got one hour for lunch. Ah. Ah, there she is. - Dominique and Albert. - Hello. - Hello. - Hello. Alright, then... Shall we go? Are you hungry? - Is that Amalia? - Yes. But how old is she? My age. The new show is a hit. We're embarking on a two-year run. In the end, I don't miss Vincent. Dominique says we can easily live without friends. She must be right. Having said that, I know where he is. He plays at the Calypso every night around eleven. You can drop by. They say he's still a good player. subs: xxuuq/KG
