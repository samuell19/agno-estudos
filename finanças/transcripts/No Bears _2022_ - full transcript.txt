Hello. What would you like? - Tea. - Me, too. - Here you are. - Thanks a lot. I see you. On my way. Where is it? You're so excited, cool it! I've 10 min. The restaurant is crowded. Show it to me. Here you are, Miss Isabelle. Your family name... Lacroix! Happy new identity! I hate this picture of me! You have to look like the real passport holder. Who is this unfortunate Isabelle Lacroix? A guest in one of these hotels. Why "unfortunate"? She's French, she'll get a new one. We only have three days. Then, the passport is no longer valid. - And yours? - Mine? What's your new name? No passport for me, yet. What do you mean? You go first and I join you later. Seriously, Bakhtiar? Zara... It's different this time. No danger, no risk, no death. You fly as a tourist to the heart of Europe. So many people would kill for a passport like this. - What if you can't join me? - I can, I will. It's a gamble. Some get lucky and leave earlier. You better settle your accounts and get ready. I can't! Keep it. Zara! It's a sure thing. Why are you afraid? Don't you get it? If not for you, I wouldn't have put up with this for 10 years. I know, but this is our last chance. Without you it would be worse than hell. Either we go together or we don't. Zara! Cut! How was it? It was... good... I wonder why the camera stays on Zara? You have to move towards Bakhtiar, leaving Zara in the background, walking towards the restaurant. The focus remains on Bakhtiar. You're right. Bakhtiar was supposed to follow Zara. But he didn't. You direct these actors. Careful, Reza, on your end marks. Tell them where to stand. And when Zara can leave. If we stay on Zara, and then pan to Bakhtiar, we have an idle frame in between, which breaks the rhythm. Let's retake the scene! Definitely! We have to. And discreetly tell Zara not to exaggerate her reaction when she gets her passport. Zara! Tell Bakhtiar not to overact. Reza! Did you get what I said? Reza! We're cut off! Hi, dear Sir! Hi! - Mr. Ghanbar. - Yes? - Do you have a ladder or a stool? - Sure, we do! - Lend it to me. - Should I bring it? I'll be right behind you. You do this every time. There is a wedding going on. He came all the way from the city. Who gives a shit! You moron! I'm really sorry. No problem, Sir. Could you put it here? Sure, dear Sir. Allow me. Right here. Sure, dear Sir. - Is this ok? - Yes. Take this for a sec! What? Go up there to search for a signal. It's not proper for you. Whatever you need. Let me do it for you. Why? The neighbors might think you're peeping at them. - I see! - Forgive my language. - Please hurry. - Sure! Permission! Keep it up for a sec! See if it's connected? Doesn't look like it. It's like that all year long. No connection! I could take it to the neighbor's roof. But it wouldn't work there either. The Sheriff of the village told me that the connection was impeccable. In his dreams! Come down, now. Your luck brought you the connection so far. We usually don't have any signal. We don't use our cellphones. We get signals from Turkey. But the bill is so high no one can afford it. Here you are. You are very well dressed! What's up? There is a ceremony! - What kind of ceremony? - The "Feet Washing". - What washing? - An engagement ceremony. They take the bride and the groom to the river to wash their feet. Listen, just a minute. Let me move this! Will you join us? They'll be over the moon. Thanks. I have lots of work to do. As you wish. Listen, I can't come but could you do me a favor? Please record the ceremony for me. I don't have a clue how. Besides, you came all the way from Tehran, why don't you film it yourself? Thanks, next time, God willing. Listen, it's quite easy. I prepared everything. Don't touch anything. Just leave it on. I'll be the fool of the village! Don't worry about it! Start filming from here. Film anyone you want. - It's filming now? - Yes, it's on automatic. I'll do my best. Keep this in your pocket. Easy. Push here to stop and here to resume. I'm going now, my dear Sir. Alright. My shoes... - Keep it in front of you! - Ok, Sir. Bravo, excellent, keep it up! Whenever you want to shoot. - Starting with you. - Why not. - Hi, Cousin Ghanbar. - Hi. - Everything ok? - Thanks and you? Replacing the pick and shovel with this? It's my dear Sir's camera. - You know how to use it? - I'm a professional filmmaker. Kids, come here for a sec. Come, right here. Why not a picture of us? Sure, stay still. Thanks. Come sit here. They shouldn't run on top of our bedroom. Sorry, sure. Don't forget it. Please, give me a minute. My dear Sir! - Sir! - Yes? Come, the meal is ready. On my way. Yummy, smells delicious. Come take your meal. Sorry to trouble you. No trouble. I get bored if I sit still. You didn't go to the ceremony? I'm too old for that. It's for young people. You're a spring chicken. I wanted to go, but these sore feet are killing me. Are you taking those magnesium tablets I gave you? It's thanks to them that I can walk a little. Ghanbar will buy me another pack. But not today. What kind of ceremony is it? Engagement ceremony. An old tradition. God bless her soul, my mother. In her time, when a boy fell in love with a girl, he would hide by the river, and he would grab her veil, then she had to marry him. Willingly or unwillingly. Don't, Sir, don't! Why? No picture of us! Trust me on this one. Ok, sure. Then the girl is engaged. No one else could ask for her hand. Now we have the "Feet Washing"! What's that exactly? That's another tradition of ours. They take the girl and the boy to two rocks by the river. The girl sits on the left and the boy on the right. The women wash the girl's feet, and the men, the boy's feet. Their future will be as bright as their feet. Their life together starts with purity. Good tradition! Even though I don't get the rationale. The girl on the right, the boy on the left. Why not the opposite? Come on! What do I know? They say, girls come from the left side of the man! Let it be! Go eat before it gets cold. I don't understand much of anything! - Thank you so much. - Enjoy! Bye. Anyway, what do I know? Yes? May I? Sir, may I come in? Yes. Forgive me. You were sleeping. I'm really sorry. Now, the groom's family is going to his place, and the bride to hers. I was afraid to leave this in our room. Didn't want anything to happen to it. I'll leave it right here. And I'll take back the tray. Permission! Ghanbar, let me check what you've done. Let me see! OK... Here we are! Bravo, excellent, keep it up! Whenever you want to shoot. - Starting with you. - Why not. Good job! No, I ruined it. Not at all. I ruined it. - Hi, cousin Ghanbar. - Hi. - Everything ok? - Thanks and you? Replacing the pick and shovel, with this? It's my dear Sir's camera. - You know how to use it? - I'm a professional filmmaker. Why did you stop it? We are very close. She could have used a bad word. No way. Didn't I tell you to push this button, on and off? Forgive me. You stopped when you shouldn't have and started when you shouldn't have. - He might be a spy! - Don't scare me, a spy? Shit! - The police might pick me up! - What a dishonor. I have to find a way. I'll keep you posted. Don't be a fool. He might plan to cross the border illegally. Nonsense! He wouldn't risk his own expensive car. You don't come to the border unless you're up to something fishy. He was introduced by the Sheriff of the village. He's on the computer all day long, talking to who knows whom. I'm bringing the tray to my mother. I'm very sorry, I apologize. Please forgive me, sorry. He stayed in the room the whole week. He seems to be trouble. I'm telling you. Bye. - All that trouble for nothing. - Right, it's not worth it. Showing off with the camera. Leave me alone! Let me get this. To Ghanbar! Replacing the pick and the shovel with a camera. Long life, Ghanbar! Wishing for my daughter's happiness. Cheers to Ghanbar. Our great filmmaker. Bless him! Mr. Panahi! It's me, Reza. Reza, why are you here? I brought the rushes. Why is your cell off? May I come in? The cell is not off. There is no signal. Wait for me on the main road. Ok, Sir. Careful that no one sees you. Well hi, Sir! Hi! - How are you doing? - Good. - What about you? - I'm fine. - The cast and crew? - They're all fine. You? The village? I'm fine, the village and the villagers are fine. Did anyone see you? You underestimate me. I sneaked in. The hard disk is in the glove compartment. You came all the way to bring the hard disk? And abandoned the crew? Wasn't only because of that. We all got worried. We decided I should come and check on you. Why worried? A filmmaker banned from leaving the country, sitting on the edge of the border... You could have been recognized and arrested. How to repair the mess then? I came to check on you. And bring you the footage. As you have no internet connection. Did you finally get that shot? Yes, that shot, and the next one too, but... It feels strange. The mood is not the same without you. The crew gossips and worries you'll ask for more takes. What's your job then? I'm following your shooting script exactly. But I share their feelings. Was there any problem on your way? No, I have a valid passport. I show it at each checkpoint. I meant any issue with the hard disk? Everyone has personal hard disks. They don't bother you for that. Did you make your decision, Maestro? What decision? If you decide to come, this is the best timing. Very sensitive moment for the shoot. It's better if you're with us. 4 to 5 days max. We'll finish the shooting and run back home. Let's do as planned and we'll see. Sir! I've worked out all the details. There are two different roads: the contraband smugglers and the people smugglers. The latter is the dangerous one. Do you remember Sinan? The Turkish guy? He's a fixer. He makes working in Turkey possible. He's a movie buff and knows a great deal about Iranian cinema. He introduced a certain Akbar to us. He is a close friend of the smugglers. Hence, the road is paved, all we need is your approval. Shall we? If you didn't want to cross the border, why come here? A place with no internet connection. This makes no sense. You could have stayed in Tehran. We wouldn't have to worry about you. Plus, the connection was good. I often wonder if staying in Tehran was not better. But being close to the location and the crew feels essential. I'll make you feel even more so. Just give me 10 min. I'll show you the location, a much safer village. Wait a sec! Wait a second! Do you see that dirt road? This is the smugglers' path. That's one of their go-fast cars. This is their route. It's only 2 kilometers. Shall we go? Let's go. Let's check it out. You can see the location. Good you decided to finally come over. Over there, there is a town. Here you'd have problems sooner or later, even if you're very cautious. Careful, here comes one of those go-fast cars. Over there you can work much faster. It's much better. For you, for us, and especially for the film. Right here. Stop right here. - Here? - Yes. Wait a second. I saw their signal. Turn off the car. Turn off the car and leave the key. Akbar's men will park it in a safe place until your return. Now what? - Let's go! - Where to? Come with me. Wait... - What is it? - The hard disk. I brought it. - Let me have it. - Here. Where is the one you were signaling to? He saw my signal. He went to check if it's safe now. We have to wait for his signal. Why are you taking this road? I don't. You go with Sinan. I'll cross the legal border. Please come for a second. Just a second. This is the town. See those lights? The lights of our shooting town. The dark area you see is the lake. It's surrounded by lighting. Our location is exactly on the other side of the lake. These are the border villages. See how easy it is! Where is the border line exactly? You are standing on it. Exactly. If it's that easy why is it so complicated to cross? I told you. The problems are related to the people smugglers. Here it's under contraband's control. The border police can't control the area. It's only the smugglers that you see. Right now, ten eyes are watching us. If we didn't know Akbar and Sinan, those eyes would have creamed us. That's the signal. Let's go! What happened? Sir? My dear Sir! - Hi! - Hi! I didn't see your car, I thought that you had left. Sir, I'm Gozal. Gozal? They say you photographed us. People saw you taking my picture with Soldooz. - Is that true? - Me? If they see it, hell will break loose. God knows there will be blood. For God's sake, Sir, please help us. Dear Sir, why are you so late? Why are you still awake? At my age you become sleepless. Drink this. It's good for you. I've been drinking this for the last 30 years. Thank you very much. It's hot! Must be hot to wash away all the tar in your lungs. Take this to clean your blood. Take it! Something wrong? Did you hear voices on the road? Did you see things, anyone? Many people and lots of things... Did you see a jinn? Hell no! You have red eyes! I didn't sleep well. I'll recover with a good night's sleep. Of course. Thank you so much. - My dear Sir! - Yes? - Can I ask you something? - Sure. Did you take a picture of a young couple? A picture? Did you? I don't think so, but I'll check again. - Thank God, you go to sleep. - Thanks again! Just remember, here people look for trouble. - Go to sleep. - Thanks. What's wrong with you? You forgot how to walk? Where are you from? Stupid foreigner. Get lost, go back home. Hi! Come in, Ghanbar. Can I ask you a question? What is it? Just a second... Did you go to the border last night? Why? I cleaned the dust off your car so no one could see it. The village road is full of dust. This dust wasn't from our village. This is from the go-fasters. Nasser goes to his land, there is no such dust on his tractor. How did you go there? I took a few different roads. I don't quite remember. I might have taken a dirt road. You are our guest. Please be careful! Even locals are scared to go there! I wonder how you dared? Be more careful! Sure. Thank you for your advice! - Do you need anything? - No, thanks. - Bye! - Bye. I show you the way. He might be resting. Let me ask first! Sure, go ahead. Yes? You have visitors. - Who are they? - Our neighbors. Let them in. Please come in. May I? Hi. Hi! - With your permission. - Please, come in! Hi! - Welcome. - Wishing you good health. Please, be seated. Welcome to our village, Sir! Thank you very much. I wonder with all the beautiful villages around Tehran, and the nice weather, why would you come to our village, so close to the border? I was looking for a place. A friend of mine mentioned this region. He knew your Sheriff and gave him a call. He kindly asked Ghanbar to rent me a room. Everything was ready quickly and I hit the road. Yes, Mother? I'll bring tea. Sure, go ahead. Did you take pictures of the village? Pictures? Sure. I take pictures sometimes. To tell you the truth we have a problem that only you can solve. We have a tradition in this village. When a girl is born, the umbilical cord is cut in the name of her future husband. When Gozal was born, that was done in the name of Yaghoob. Who's Yaghoob? Yaghoob is family. He's a fine fellow. Now that they're old enough, they're supposed to get married. However... - I'll go help Mother if you allow me? - Sure! - With your permission. - Ok. Only if Soldooz leaves them alone. Sorry, who's Soldooz? Soldooz is also family but more distant. It seems that he's in love with Gozal. And won't give up. We cornered him a few times, but he denied everything. I talked to his father, he said "You're dishonoring my son. Show me the proof." Now if you give me that picture, we'll show it to his father and prove our point. The truth is that I don't know about this specific picture. I take a lot of pictures. But I don't remember taking this one. You didn't take the picture of this couple under the walnut tree? A picture of a boy and a girl? Under the walnut tree... The picture of a boy and a girl? No. I didn't. Are you sure? Yes. I'm sure. Well, dear Sir, we leave with your permission. You didn't have your tea! No, thanks anyway. - Stay for lunch. - Thank you. Thanks a lot. Here we are. Permission! - After you! - Go ahead. I'm leading the way. Permission! - Hi there. - Ghanbar, how are you? Hi. - Well hi. How are you? - Thank you so much. - What a pleasure to meet you. - The pleasure is mine. Please, come in. This way! Permission! Come upstairs. - Most welcome. - Great seeing you. Ghanbar, can you check the dog? He's not feeling well. Sure, Sir! I wanted to come and see you. A turn of events brought you here! Please. Lead the way! - Welcome to my humble home. - Too kind. Dear fellow, why did you stay indoors the whole week? Come visit the village. Get to know the villagers. Have a seat! I was looking forward to seeing you. - Welcome! - Thanks. Is Ghanbar's place comfortable? Very comfortable. Thank God! I don't want our friend to be upset. No reason for that! It's all good. Just too much trouble for the old lady. Good people! I heard that villagers came to see you. I didn't join them on purpose. Villagers have big mouths! I'd be ashamed if they bothered you. They're reasonable people. No problem at all. Thank God! They asked for a picture? What? Did you give them Soldooz's picture? You know I'm the Sheriff here. People respect me, they listen to me. If you give me the picture, I can talk to both sides, and settle the problem. You know Sir, farming is not rewarding anymore. The drought finished off farmers. They make their living by exchanging smuggled goods at the border. When a beautiful pricy car parades around, the news travels and gets where it shouldn't! The next day, the police patrol pops up. Villagers can't make a living anymore. I'm the only one accountable because I invited you here. I asked Ghanbar to rent you a room. Now, please give me the picture. Aha, I got your point. You guys are looking for an excuse to make me leave the village. No excuse needed. Just tell me and I leave. Dear Sir, don't say that! No one wants you to leave unhappy. We need more guests. We want our village to prosper! Then why are you picking on me? I'm sorry to have upset you. It wasn't my intention. It doesn't seem to be a good time. Another day maybe. Yes? Hi! What is it? I'm Soldooz! The one in the picture you took with Gozal. I need a few minutes of your time. This time of the night? It's an emergency. Please allow me just a few words. You didn't ask for permission to come in. Now you ask for permission to talk? Forgive me. I didn't mean to barge in on you. I was raised in this village. But I was accepted into university in Tehran. Then, I was expelled after participating in a demonstration. I thought I could come back and start over. Of course, I had another motivation. My motivation was Gozal. I'm in love with Gozal. Why don't you sit down? Yaghoob has been on my case since I got back. I promised Gozal that I'd take her away from the village. It's ridiculous. They say Gozal's umbilical cord was cut for Yaghoob. The two families were not on good terms. The prospect of a marriage eased things up. We're going to elope in a week. Just don't share the picture for a week. That's no solution. Why not try to talk to them? To say what? You wouldn't be here, if talking could help. What do you mean? Well, you could have solved your problem with words, too. You couldn't. Could you? Mr. Panahi, you landed in hot water, I landed in hot water, too! - Are you threatening me? - What? No! Forget about the picture. In a week I'll be out of your hair! Permission to leave! - Reza. - Yes Sir, give me a moment. Get out of the frame. Come over here. Sir, is the connection ok? It's better now! May we start? Do you see the shot? Everything ready? Yes, everything ready, just waiting for you. Let's begin. We won't be disconnected? No, I'm on the top of the hill. The connection is really good. Guys, Mr. Panahi can see us. Shall we? - Rolling. - Ready? 3, 2, action! You forgot about me And I was crushed But still happy with our memories I gave you my heart And was trapped in your love Now, free of all sorrows I gave you my heart, free of all sorrows Laugh at my bloody tears Still burning from the fire of your eyes My eyes still looking for you Let her be. Would you go without her? Let's have a smoke. Why are you so quiet? It's a birthday party. Play a happy song. Cut, was ok. Amin! Wait. I want to talk to Mr. Panahi. Reza! Can I have your hands-free? Sure. Hi Mr. Panahi. Hi Bakhtiar. What's up? The smuggler called and made an appointment for tomorrow. What for? He might be lying, but he said my "game" is next! What does that mean? It means that they have a passport for me. Then what? I'll be leaving with Zara. Reza! I can hear you. Reza, did you know about this? Not till now. I didn't have a chance to tell him. Can you convince the smuggler to let us document the appointment? Good idea, will do. What are you talking about? You can't do that. - They are smugglers! - No worries. I'll take care of it. Come in! Permission! Hi! A few villagers are here to talk to you. Let them in then. It's better if you come out. Sorry! This way. Quiet! I'll talk to him. Hi. Hi, Sir. Thanks for coming. Sorry to bother you. What is the problem? What did I tell you yesterday? What did you say? I told you to give me the picture. Didn't I? Yes, you did and I told you that I didn't have it! This picture has become a big concern. It's paralyzing all of us. This is an important piece of evidence. If you give it to me I can easily settle the case. Unfortunately, you're not cooperating. I told you and I repeat it to our friends here. I never took a picture of those two youngsters. Liar! I don't believe him! Quiet! I'm talking! You go bring the witness. Come here, dear boy! Tell us whatever you saw! Let's go up there. I'll show you. - Did you get what he said? - Let's go anywhere you want. After you. Go ahead! Sorry! Please! Now tell us what you saw. I was standing over there. - Where? - There! Go stand over there! Were you alone? Hassan was with me. What happened next? He asked me to sit here to photograph me! So, he asked you to sit here. Sit on the same spot! Here. Where was he standing? There! Stand over there! He photographed us from there. Then what? Then he noticed the girl and the boy! - Where was the couple? - There! So, the couple was over there. Then he took a picture with his camera. - He turned his camera to them. - Yes. Then he turned and took another picture of us. - He photographed them and then you? - Right. What do you say to that? You have a witness, right? You don't need the picture to prove you're right. The kid is only nine. His testimony is not accepted by law or by sharia. No one would acknowledge his testimony. You're accusing me with the same testimony that you now say is illegal? Why are you protecting Soldooz? Is he a family member? A cousin perhaps? Give me the picture and end this nonsense. You want a picture? Come with me! Follow me! Just a minute. Where is the Sheriff? - Come here! - Yes. Look at this! These are all the pictures I took in your village. I don't have any other pictures. That's all I have. Look closely! No sign of the couple you mention. See, no picture of them. To ease your mind, you can have the memory card of the camera. - No need for that. - Show it to whomever you want. I don't even want it back! It's yours! - Please don't. - Just leave me in peace! - Don't be upset! - Just leave! Please! You upset our guest over nothing! You dishonored me. Ghanbar! Yes Sir. What's up now? The villagers want you to take an oath! - Do what? - We have a tradition. You'll swear to God in front of the villagers. It's an old tradition... We have a Swear Room. You swear to God you're telling the truth. Sorry to bother you. I said yes to all of your requests. It just takes a few minutes. Swear and wrap the whole thing up! We are good people. Don't go with a heavy heart. I have done this twice and the disputes were settled smoothly. Come and let's get it over with. Come on please. His son doesn't have any priors? He had a few fights but didn't end up in the police station or the court. Fights don't matter. Any demonstrations? No, he just finished school. I didn't know he was here. He disappeared for a week or two. The family was really concerned. He called from here and said he needed money to go to Europe. Poor them, they managed to send $5,000. I introduced you saying you'll help him. Bakhtiar, I can't do anything with 5,000. His cousin went to Germany with less. One can go with less than 1,000. But how? By land? By sea? It's damn risky. It's on the news every day. My way is the safest. Your wife will fly safely and be in the heart of Paris. - How much should they have? - Minimum 12,000. They don't have it, man. They sold all they had, except the family house. They're in dire straits if they sell. No can do! Listen. Go stand over there, and don't look back. Bakhtiar! I'm doing this for Sinan. I'm going to pick up something. Don't you guys look back. The man with the camera should stop. I can't guarantee your safety otherwise. Understood? What should I do now, Bakhtiar? Either Europe or back to Iran. Just not here. He'll get used to it as time passes. How can I? He's not willing to come back. What's his problem with Iran? Why doesn't he want to go back? He feels trapped, with no future, no freedom and no job. Please talk to him. I'll stay for two more days. Convince him. I'll talk to him. Hope it works. Bakhtiar! You're really lucky! I have a passport for you. It belongs to an English tourist. We have to take a picture and photoshop it. You came to help your friend but your problem got solved! Now he can turn around. Tell him you and I are taking that street. He should not look back. He'll stand here for ten minutes and leave after. Let's go. Hi, Sir! - Can I take a moment of your time? - Sure! Tea? Thank you, but I must go. I'm going there, too. We have time. Please! Let's have tea! The path is not safe! There are bears. After a cup of tea we'll go together! - Please! - Thanks! - Hi! - Hi! Most welcome. Take that seat. Please! - Hi, Sir. - Hi. - Respectfully. - It's on me. Where is Ghanbar? He wasn't home. I don't know where he is. I got the Swear Room's address from his mother! You made a wise decision. If not, they'd have assumed you were lying. What should I do once there? Nothing special! We're different from city people. We have special traditions. You just take an oath. That's it! Here, we have all kinds of disputes over water, over land... You just swear to God and it's a done deal! - Thank you. - Thanks. Even lying under oath is acceptable as long as it's for peace making. It doesn't matter if you took the picture or not. You just have to swear you didn't. They all make peace and it's over. Please have your tea! You know very well that villagers are different from city people. Town people have problems with authorities. We have problems with superstition. Doesn't look good if we go there together. It's very simple! Make a left and you're there! No need for me to come. What about the bears? There are no bears. Nonsense! Stories made up to scare us! Our fear empowers others. No bears! Just go left. No bears! Just paper bears. It's quite safe. Go! Hi! Hi! Be seated! Sit over there. - Where? - Over there! - You're most welcome! - Thanks. These are the Elders of our village. These, the youngsters. And those are our children, our future, who will learn and safeguard our traditions. You are present in the oath-taking ceremony. Excuse my indiscretion but you are here as the accused. You have to swear and convince your plaintiff. Bring the Quran! In front of the accused. Thank you. I respect your tradition but allow me to do it in my own way. Instead of taking the oath, I'd like to film the ceremony and give you each a copy. An undeniable proof! Is that ok? Did you understand what he said? He wants to film his own witnessing. He will give us each a copy. No denial after that. What do you say? Ok! We accept! You can do it. Take back the Quran. I was told that your parents speak Azari like us. Please speak Azari. It's a bit difficult for me, especially in front of so many people. Sometimes, I can't find the right words. Even at home, I can only speak Azari to my mom! Even with my brothers, I talk in Farsi. Allow me to speak in Farsi. I can express myself more fluently. No problem. Go ahead. I'll start filming with your permission. With your permission! Today, in front of Jooban's inhabitants... Jaban. I testify that I never took the picture you mention and have no other pictures from this village in my possession. All the pictures I took are in the memory card that I gave to your Sheriff. Today, I only came here to respect your traditions, but sometimes I don't understand them. I don't know how to deal with your traditions... like... cutting the umbilical cord of someone in the name of someone else... What the hell is he talking about? Who the hell are you? Who asked for your opinion? Who are you to disrespect our traditions? Stop this charade. We were talking, Yaghoob! Nonsense! My life has been ruined. And no one cares. You see an important person from the city and you believe whatever he says. What's got into you? Bears got your tongues now? You let him disrespect our traditions. I'm talking to each and every one of you. I was there when you were in trouble. Now you're leaving me alone? You! Didn't I go to jail for you? Because you had a wife and kids? The bears got your tongue, too? You were all enjoying our cord-cutting ceremony, eating and laughing. Why this attitude now? Express your opinion proudly. Five years ago, I went to ask another girl's hand. You said she belonged to someone else. "There will be blood." Why aren't you supporting me? I'm 30 now! No one would give me another girl. No one! The bastard is after my honor, my future wife. My honor is our honor. What's the difference? Aren't we all from the same family? You are abandoning me, not backing me up. I'm done with you! I'll deal with the bastard myself! You can all bugger off with your stupid traditions. Yaghoob, stop! Where the hell are you going? Goodbye. Bye. Goodbye. Take care. Take care. - See you. - Hope you'll be alright. Bye. To a bright future. See you soon. Take care. - I'll miss you. - Me, too. - Bye. - Take good care. God willing, your problem will be solved, too. - Bye. - Bye. Mr. Panahi! Yes? Mr. Panahi, sorry but... What is it, Zara? Didn't you tell us that you'll make a movie based on our lives? I did. That everything will be based on reality? Correct. What is this charade, then? None of this is real. What's not real? You mean you don't know? What is it that I'm supposed to know that I don't? - Give me your passport. - What's wrong? Give it to me. - Give it to me. - What do you want it for? Don't you know this is fake? - Calm down. I'll explain to you. - Wait a sec. You do not know this is fake? I don't get it. You got the passport from the same smuggler. Didn't you? I didn't know it was fake. Now you know! I just saw the cover page. I thought his was as good as yours. You just want me to leave? - I wasn't aware... - Enough, Mr. Panahi! Here everything is fake. We all became fake here. I endured jail and torture to stay true to myself. By stealing a woman's identity, I betrayed both her and myself. You're all in this mess just so you can create your happy ending, showing light at the end of the tunnel. Some people might make it out of here. Did you ask yourself, what will happen to me? Why should I leave no matter what? Why should anyone leave? It's been 10 years. We tried everything, risked drowning in the ocean. Then tried again and again... At each return, we got stuck at the border, trying again. Did you ask yourself, what will happen to this man without me? What will happen next? He can't even inject his insulin without me. Or worse, he can't even brush his teeth. I don't want this life anymore. Enough is enough! Reza! What have you guys done? We haven't done anything wrong. At the birthday party, you told us to document the next day's encounter. I told Sinan to talk to the smuggler and convince him. He got paid and agreed to be filmed if his face was not shown. And at a certain point, he didn't let us follow him. So, we didn't go and we don't know what happened next between them. Stop it, Yaghoob! What the hell are you doing? Take him to the other side. Get lost! You should be ashamed of yourselves. Yaghoob! Leave it! What did I tell you? Get lost. If it wasn't for you I would tear him into pieces. Get lost, idiot! Look at me. Wherever I go he comes and beats me up. - Next time I know what to do. - Shut the hell up! If he tears me into pieces, you're accountable. Get lost. Stupid, idiot! I won't allow any hooligans in this village. That period is over! You better go inside! Why make such a mess? Come talk to me, instead. There is a Sheriff in the village. I won't allow any bullying or fighting in this village! Up to my last breath. I won't allow it. You're educated. You went to school. These poor guys work hard to send you to school. Educated people talk, resolving the problem by talking, not by fighting and not by bullying. Hi, Reza? Hi, do you hear me? Reza? Do you hear me? Hi, Sir! Sorry, there was an incident. What is it? Zara and Bakhtiar vanished this morning. They are nowhere to be found! What do you mean? I asked everybody, no one knows. It's a first! They used to keep me posted on their whereabouts. That was the deal. We're going to look for them in town with Sinan. Did you check their place? The door was open, everything seemed normal. What shall we do if we don't find them? I don't know. Keep looking and keep me posted. Sure. Bye. Bye. We found Bakhtiar. The bar owner at Zara's work called Sinan to help his friend. He's in really bad shape, crying all the time. I told Amin and he took the camera to capture the whole scene. Sinan tried to convince her to let us bring the camera in. She finally agreed to let Sinan in. Sinan went in with the camera on record. I'll keep you posted on the outcome. Sinan, take your friend out of here. He has been sitting here for four hours, bothering our customers. Bakhtiar, what are you up to? Be a bit patient. Everything will be fine. You endured so much! What are a few more days? We'll find her. Sinan, turn it off. Everything's going to be fine? Now that I lied to her, nothing will be fine again. I shouldn't have lied to her. Why do you think that she always wears a bracelet? Twice, she attempted suicide... by cutting her wrist. Jail, torture and exile weren't as hard on her as my lie. My lie destroyed her. It hurt her more than all the abuses she endured. - Yes? - Hi, Sir! Hi. Sorry to bother you. But I have no other choice. I have to come in. Come! Permission! Remember seeing me with the policeman? A guard came to bring me to the station. He wouldn't answer my questions. Once there, he took me to the Revolutionary Guard Amiri. First, he mentioned my old case. I was kind of relieved. But then he said: "You have a guest. He has a car. His car is registered under Miss Tahereh..." Tahereh Saeedee Balssini. Yes, that's it. He asked if you were my guest. I said no, that you were my tenant. Then he asked how long you've been here. I said 9 days. He asked for a contract. I said I usually don't do a contract. He asked when you are leaving. I said I don't know. He got really angry. He said your car was seen on the road to the border. I said you were probably lost, not knowing the area. He said, how come you came back alive and unhurt? He found this unlikely and suspicious. He wants a contract, with full ID information. I have to take that to him. Then he asked if you had a camera, if you were taking pictures. I confessed I myself filmed a ceremony for you and ruined your film. He stared at me and said: "First thing in the morning! You bring me your ID and the documents for this stranger you call 'my dear Sir'. Bring all this and we will see." I now have to disturb you with this. Here is my ID card. Please, write the contract yourself. And give me a copy of your ID. Tomorrow, I can bring him everything. Sorry to bother you. Need anything else? No, thanks. - Good night. - Good night. - Ghanbar? - Yes, Sir? What was your old case about? Nothing important. Leave the contract behind the door. I'll pick it up tomorrow morning, without waking you up. Good night. Amin, what if it's Zara? Bakhtiar, control yourself. Be strong. Bad news! We're going to a village by the sea. The police were told a young Iranian woman went into the sea and never came back. Hopefully, it's fake news. Sinan is there already. The police and ambulance are there. Be patient. Let's get there and see for ourselves. There might be a mistake. Maybe it's not Zara. - Maestro, we're here. - Might be someone else. Oh my God, Zara! Bakhtiar got out of the car. Should I follow him? No, don't. I can see everything. Let's see what Sinan does. Let me go. Just be calm. God, it's her. Cut. Amin, cut... Permission! Come in, Ghanbar. Bad news! Sorry! I went to the station this morning, with all the documents. The guard Amiri wasn't there. Someone else took the documents. He said we have to wait for Mr. Amiri. The guard who brought me there yesterday, a guy from Isphahan, was there too. He was listening to us. Sir, are you listening? He said: "We have to wait for Amiri to return this afternoon! Or wait for him outside." So, I decided to come back home. The Isphahani guy stopped me and said: "Listen Ghanbar, you're in hot water, tell your guest to hit the road and leave this place. It's becoming dangerous!" We are honorable people. We have always lived honorably in this village. I've lived an irreproachable life! I rented the room to make extra money. But I can't afford having policemen and Revolutionary Guards in my house. This is not my problem. I'm a good person. I'm no backstabber. You have to do something! It's your decision! To stay or not to stay! I apologize again. Time to go! - Your cooking was awesome. - Glad you enjoyed it. Thank you for all your kindness. Don't forget to take your pills. When you come to Tehran... Ghanbar, let me know when she does. I know a great doctor. God bless you, Sir. These are for you. Boil it and drink it every two days. - You are another son to me. - Thank you. - Don't smoke. - I won't until I get to the car. You forgot this on the table. No, this is for Mother. Leave it there. Thank you so much. - Let me help you. - Thanks. Sorry my dear Sir, I have to rush. Bye. Safe trip. Trying to cross the border, Soldooz and Gozal both got shot. They dragged themselves back. Where to? Don't stay here. You have to go. Go! You have to leave. Take that road. Leave! Just leave.
