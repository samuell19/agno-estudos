Next, please. - How you doing? - Good, thanks. How are you? Where are you travelling this morning? Just going back to town. Purpose of your visit? I'm going home. - Have a nice day. - Thanks, you too. Hello? At the house. Mmm-hmm. Okay, Dad. Yes! Very nice. What, no uniform today? Not today. Good to see you, man. Good to see ya. It's a shame 'cause I was looking forward to seeing the new you. Well, you should stop by sometime. - See me in action. - Yeah, I tried. You never returned my call. What? They don't give you any breaks or what? Hey, man. The boxes don't pack themselves. - Could see anyone on the way in? - No, no. It's dead. I couldn't believe it when the phone rang. I said, "Boy, you must be desperate..." I guess I just missed you. - Shit! - Come on, come on... You just needed the money, didn't you? It's good to see you. You too. Okay. Here. I'll ride back with you. - All right. - Throw those in my car. Oh... Got it. That was Dad. - What? - Yeah, apparently, he left a few things at the house and he wants me to go and... pick them up. He didn't sound good. - Yeah, well... - He sounds... shaken. - Uh-huh. He's adjusting. - He's miserable, Stephen. Well, it's only been a week. He just finds things to complain about. It's the best home in the city. I don't know what to tell you. This makes me feel like shit. I know and that's what he wants you to feel. You know? His house isn't safe now. I know. What if we gave him Chris's room? - You can't be serious. - No, come on. It's got its own little bathroom, it's tucked away... It's not even being used. - Stephen, it's not even being used. - I wonder why it's not? I'm gonna... We'll talk about this later. - Stephen... - I'm gonna... grab a few things. Shouldn't be long. You had a fucking laugh. What? You know what I'd like to know? - What? - What would this be for you? Like would this be, like, nine months' salary? Oh, fuck off, man. Fuck off. Tell me it's not more than 10. - Why do you do it? Honestly? - You know why. Wow. How's it going with you? How's Lori? Oh, you know... Complaining her fucking life away. So it's the same then? Pretty much. Whoa, what's that? What's that? - I thought you said it was dead. - It was! - Go around! - I can't! There's nowhere to fucking go! I'll grab the bike. You grab the guy. No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait! What's going on? Hey, what're you doing? - Hey, buddy, you okay? - Don't talk to him. - I said don't talk to him! - On the ground! You, on the ground! On the fucking ground! Now! Right now! - Get the fuck down! - Okay, okay! - You, over here! Bring the keys! - Everything's cool. Keys! Shut the fuck up! Keys. On the ground. You too. Back up. Stay down! Okay. Okay, let's go! Let's go! - Babe, let's go. Come on! - Let's go then. How did he know we were here? Who gives a fuck? I don't know. Come on, man! - What are you doing, Adams? - Let's get the fuck out of here! - How did you know we were here? - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - How did you know? - Wait a second. - Get the fuck off, man. - No, no! Wait, wait! Chris! Chris! Hey, hey, hey. Okay, just... - Just wait a second, all right? - Just wait, man. This was you? This's bullshit, man. That's fucking bullshit. Just listen, okay? Both of you? It's not what you think. - This isn't... - Jesus Christ, man! Okay. What were you gonna do? Split it? - Was that the plan? - Jesus, man... For 200 fucking grand? Are you serious? Throw it away. - Oh, fuck. What... you're gonna shoot me now? - Throw it the fuck away! - You're gonna shoot me and rob me? - Fuck you! Fuck you! You're such a piece of shit! Let's just talk about this, okay? Lori, put the gun down. What the fuck are you doing? You really think he's just going to forgive us? - Jesus Christ! Just put the gun down. - Listen. I'm sorry. Okay? - Just put the gun down! - What are you sorry for? I'm sorry for... I'm sorry for everything! I'm sorry for being a fucking asshole! Oh, for being an asshole... Babe, look. You don't wanna do this. You don't wanna do this. This is not you. Oh, fuck! What the fuck? Go, go, go! Get the fucking bags! Get the fucking bags! Fuck! You fucking bitch! Lori, get the fucking bags! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! - Chris. - He could have killed us. He just shot me. - He just shot me. - Just hang on! Just hang on! Hi. I hate it when you walk away like that. Chris is just fine. - I know. - He doesn't even want to live with us. He knows we love him and he has his own place... What was that? I'm gonna call you back. Jeremy? - Have you been talking to your brother lately? - Mom... He knows that you love him. Honestly. He's probably just really busy. Well, how's his job going? - It's good. - So, and? What do you mean, "and?" He goes to work and he comes home. - What else do you need to know? - I want you to talk to me. - About what, Mom? - Everything. This... whole situation. We never talk about it. Come on. What do you think? Well, I think if you treat somebody like an outsider, then they become an outsider. And if you don't, then they don't. I mean, I don't know. Mom. You see, this is... I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. No, it's okay. It's fine. It's just... It's just menopause. - Don't get it on me. - No, you can't catch it. When did you become so wise, huh? - Come here. What's your rush? - Mom... Oh, fuck. What are you doing? - Nothing. - I just saw you. - Whose bike is that? - No one... Just a friend's. - A friend? - Yeah. - What are you doing here? - I was gonna borrow Pop's car. - You're gonna borrow the car? - Yeah. - What is that blood on you? - Huh? - What's wrong? - I was just... - I'm gonna explain later. - Are you okay? - I'm gonna see you later... - Hey! Wait! Wait, wait, wait... Chris... - Oh fuck. - Chris. Chris, tell me. Tell me. Answer me. What happened? - Are you okay? - It's bad. It's bad. It's really bad. Yeah, you don't understand. - I'll understand. Just tell me. - There was a... There was a girl. She was on my bike. - Right. - And she fell off and I tried to turn back to get her, but I couldn't. - You left her? - I had to. I couldn't carry her or the bags. Why didn't you call an ambulance? - Just... - What? - Just... - What? She was shot, Dad. They would've asked questions. So I hid her... I hid her away in one of the old fields behind... by the Myers Farm, so... There was no one around. I gotta go back there before someone finds her. Is she still alive? I don't think so. - Okay. You know what're you gonna do? - I don't know. Do you even have a plan? It's a human being. Chris. - It's a human being. - I know that. I didn't have a choice. - Get in the car. - What? What're we gonna do? Hey! Did you get my message? Yeah, just bleeding to death over here. Yeah. I don't know. 'Cause he's a greedy cunt. Yeah. Yeah. Look, uh... I'm gonna need your help finding him. I don't know! That's why I'm fucking calling you! What do you usually charge? Like, 10? No, I'm at his place now. Yeah. No, I don't know. All right. All right! Just fucking... Just let me know. Okay. Where do you want these? Mom? Mom, where do you want these? - Why are you yelling? - Where do you want them? I want them in the shed. Hey. - Where's Chris? - What? Where's Chris? Where the fuck is Chris? I don't know. He doesn't live here anymore. Look. Where would he go to hide? - If he didn't wanna be found, where the fuck would he go? - His apartment. - Try harder. - I don't know. - I don't know. - Want me to ask Mom and Dad? Okay. Okay, stop! Fuck! Okay. I know a spot. I don't know if he's gonna be there, but we can try. Good. Okay. Show me. You show me. And why would he rob you? - I don't know. - Yes, you do. - He must've been jealous. - Jealous of what? I thought you just said that he was your friend. We were. It's complicated. You just bring it across and you hand it over. Is that... Is that what happens? It's the exact same thing... that you got caught for before. That's what we're talking about here. The thing that's almost torn this family apart. - That's what we're talking about, right? - Yeah. - There it is. - Just keep driving. Keep driving. Okay, pull over. Pull over. - You didn't leave a marker? - What? - You didn't leave a marker? - No, I didn't have any time. Oh, Jesus. It all looks the same. Yeah, I know. I could've sworn she was... Fuck! Fucking, fucking she was... What the hell? Shit! Fuck! - Shit. - Wait. Where did you... Fuck. I'm okay. You don't even know which side she's on? I do. Just... Well, maybe somebody found her. No. If they did, there'd be cops everywhere, Dad. Fuck. - Well maybe she is not dead. - Do you really think I would leave her if she wasn't dead? Just help me. Look in there. Princess! Come on, girl! Look, man. He must've been desperate. Nah, he's just a fucking prick. Wait. Were you talking to him? No. No, I wasn't. - I thought he was done... - Oh, fuck you, you little shit. You think I don't know about you? Huh? I know you used to sell dime bags for him. I know all about you. So don't try to cover for him. I know that your mom had a fucking breakdown when he got caught and that didn't even stop him, did it? Does she know about you too, huh? Look, I'm just saying... - I know he liked you. - Oh, fuck you! He hasn't called me in two years. He had to make a clean break. That' what he told me. He had to cut everything off. All right. Get out. Get the fuck out. - Hello. - Hey. - How's it going? - Good. Good. Yeah. I'm Chris. - Wayne. - Hey, nice to meet you, Wayne. - Yeah. - What's, uh... What's going on? Uh, she's got herself into something down there. - Something dead probably. - Yeah. - You know what they're like. - Yeah. - They love getting the stick, don't they? - Yeah, yeah, I know. - I love dogs. - Yeah. Here, girl. Come here, girl. - Come here. - Don't worry about her. She's fine. Seriously. Poor thing has Parkinson's. - Really? - Her motor skills are shot, but I swear it's affecting her brain. She's half mental. - Is everything okay? Where are you? - I'm with Adams. We're at Pop's. Are you okay? Look. Don't say anything. - Where are you? - I'm gonna come with the bags right now. Just don't hurt him, okay? I'll be over there in just a bit. - Fuck you! - I swear to God, I didn't wanna do this. I didn't have a choice, man. - I owe money... A lot of money. - To who? Who do you owe money to? Tell me. It doesn't matter... Fuck you, it matters! You shot me! No, she shot you. Yeah, well, you know what? I'll fucking get her back, don't worry about that. You already did. She's dead, man. What? You shot her. Fuck you. You're lying to me. I'm not, I'm not. She didn't make it. You used her against me. You knew how she felt and you used her against me. - No, it wasn't like that... - Yes, it is! - Listen, buddy, it wasn't... - And now she's dead! You know what? You better get the fuck over here with those bags right now, or I'll shoot your whole fucking family. Do you understand me? Don't you even think about calling the cops, 'cause I'm not going to jail again. We gotta go. We... gotta go back. - Why? - He got Jeremy. - What? - Jeremy's with him. What are you talking about? Look, where? I don't know, but I know a guy who can find them and he can take care of Adams. We can go there right now. In 30 minutes, this'll all be over. We'll never see Adams again. We just gotta pay him. Adams knows him and he knows not to fuck with him, okay? - Let's go there right now! - What are you talking about? Are you talking about calling some sort of hitman? No, no. He's not a hitman. He's... He's protection. This is why I didn't want you to come along. - I'm gonna call the police. - No! No, no, no! Dad, Dad, Dad! You can't call the police! If they police get involved, he'll kill him. He will. He'll kill him. He just said that. He won't hurt him. I know you don't believe me, but it's true. He just wants the bags. Which we don't have. He doesn't know that. So as long as he thinks that we do, then we have time. And if we act now, then we can... We can... I don't know we can get the upper hand, but if the police show up, I don't know what he's gonna do. So it's up to you. What about this girl? This girl in the field? We're just gonna leave her here to die? She's already dead. And even if we find her, he's not gonna stop. We're gonna have to face him. God! Guess I don't have a choice, do I? Once we get Jeremy back, we'll come back for her. I just gotta stop by a bank machine. - What? - I gotta pay him. We'll pay him later. No! It doesn't work like that. There's one in the strip mall. It's on the way, I'll be five minutes. You know, I met your mom. Couple of years ago, Lori and I were helping Chris move. She stopped on by. There was this funny moment that I'll never forget. I caught her staring at us from across the room. You know. I smiled to her, you know. She just kept staring at us with this blank expression, like. "Oh, she did not approve of us." You know. We were not good enough for her. Or for her son. I was pretty impressed honestly, because most people would have looked away. But... She just... she just held it there. You know, your brother always painted a picture of her like she was half a wreck. Didn't seem that way to me. Seemed like she had more guts than the rest of you. You haven't changed, you haven't changed. You haven't changed one bit. And you wonder why you don't have any friends. 'Cause you screwed them all over and you fought half of 'em like you - your friend in soccer. - He wasn't my friend. - He wasn't your friend? - He wasn't my friend. Oh, well then who was your friend? Was the kid in band your friend? Or half the kids on the goddamn street? Were they your friends? I would have given you money. If you needed it that bad, I would have mortgaged the house. - All you had to do is ask. - Oh, Right! Right! You haven't talked to me in over a year. Well, neither of you have. You treat me like I don't even exist. And that's fine. I fucked up, I get it, but don't go on like I can just call you up. Because that's bullshit. Jesus Christ, Dad. You gave up on me. I had nowhere to turn, and you closed the door on my face So, don't act like I can just turn to you when I need help. Because I can't. And I didn't fight all my friends. That kid in soccer, you told me to hit him. He was picking on me, and you told me to hit him. I know I was doing good until today. I work hard. You have no idea. Hurry up. - Hey love. - Hey! What's going on, I thought you'd be back by now. Well, there's just been a little accident with the car. How's it going? - Good. - Good! Just looking to sell an earring of mine. I've got a watch too. I was actually in a few weeks ago. You offered me six grand for the earring. Six grand, eh? Yeah. Offer my wife, too? No, it's fine. Honestly. Okay, well, let me know if you need anything. I just... I'll let you know. Hey, listen, you haven't talked to Jeremy, have you? Um, no. Why? That's weird. I asked him to put a couple of things in the shed and I haven't seen him since. I tried calling, but he's not picking up. He just... he said that he had some things to do. Yeah. I get it. I think I better get going, or else... Dad called again. I'll give you four grand. Come on, man. Two weeks ago it was six. - Two weeks ago I had cash. - Jim? Jimmy Martin. Hazelwood elementary? No, sorry. My gosh, you're the spitting image - of one of my students. - Just give me a second. What? I taught there 15 years before I hurt my shoulder. You know what, screw it man, let's do it. Let's do four. Four is good. Are you sure you're not related to the Martins? No, I don't know them, I'm sorry. Excuse me, we'll do four. Four is fine. You know what? It's a nice stone, but uh... I got a lot of nice stones. Oh, come on, man. Come on, what's the problem? Let's do it. Let's do four. Sorry, man. Yeah, I do know that. So what? What are we gonna do? So, maybe we acted too quickly. Oh, for God's sakes. It's not working. I wanna talk about Chris's room again. Yeah, they're calling me over right now, you know. I really got to go. No, don't do that. I really, really think that this can work. Listen, I've got people coming at me from this side, I've got you coming at me from this side. You always do this. Every single time. I got to go now. I don't wanna give up on him, Stephen. No, just our son. - I don't understand the problem. - I was just being polite. I came in here. I came in here two weeks ago. With the exact same stone and you offered me $6000 and now you won't do four man? I didn't even think you'd say yes. - You offered me six grand... - I didn't think you'd say yes. - Then you offer me and four's no good. - It's not a good week. - Gotcha. Come back. - Jesus! Come back. It's not the same one. - Excuse me? - Did you switch it? - Did you switch it? - Hey, hey. Did you fucking switch it? Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no, I'm sorry. - Just take the stone and go. - I don't want that piece of shit. - I'm calling the police. - I want my diamond earring, please. Call 'em. - Tell them you're trying to fucking rob me. - Hello? I need car down here... - Hey! Hey! Hey! - Let me go. Get the fuck off me, man. I've got to go. I really got to go. I'm gonna call you right back. Okay. - Hey, hey, hey! Chris! - He tried to rob me. The police are coming. They're on their way. Four thousand for my earring. - I never said that! - Yes, you did! Chris, what the hell are you doing? - He puts in a fake and he switches it. - What are you doing here? Your son is a liar. Your son's a liar. Look, I know, I know if I told you about the earring then you wouldn't come. - Earring? - I didn't have the money. But I swear to God, he ripped me off. As soon as he turned around, he fucking switched it. And now he won't give us the money. I don't have anything to pay Samson with. He fucked us okay. Dad, dad, dad. I promise you. I fucking promise you. I know how much hurt I've caused everyone. I know that, and there's nothing I can do about it. But I'm telling you the truth. - Did you tell my son that you're gonna give him four grand. - No I did not. The police are coming, they are on the way - Bullshit. - Is that what you do, you... You wait till people's backs are turned and then you rob them? - Did you rob my son? - He's a liar. - We're not leaving without that money. - Chris. Well I guess you're not leaving then. 'Cause this is my shop, pal. And we can wait as long as you can wait here. And you don't come in here dictating to me and my wife. Well, I'm not trying to dictate. I just want you to give him what's his. - Who the hell are you anyway? - Who am I? I... - His father. - And who you think they're gonna believe? Where did he even get the stone? Did you ask him that? - It's not your fucking business. - Exactly. Because he probably stole it. I mean what kind of kid walks around with a $5000 diamond. Oh, now it's 5000? You fucking piece of shit. You must be real proud of this one. Good job with the parenting, man. Congratulations. Dad! Dad! The money in the safe. Dad, the safe, the money. - Okay! - Do it. $4000. Okay. We're just gonna get what's ours... - Chris? - Yeah? - Let him go. - I got him. Let him go. We're just gonna take what's ours. - I got him, Dad. - We're gonna go. We're gonna go, let's go. Keep the stone. Did I really tell you to hit him? That kid from soccer, the kid with the... Jesus! I don't remember that. I remember him though, I remember that he had buck teeth and that he looked like a little beaver. Why didn't he get his teeth fixed? Seriously! Didn't he have parents? I saw him not long ago. What was he doing? He was cutting wood. With... a skill saw. He's a carpenter. Well, good for him. Good for him. Hold up, hold up. Wait a minute. Is that? It's fine, it's not like he's gonna call the cops. I'll just give him the money and he'll take care of it. Okay? And then we'll get Jeremy back. It's okay. - I'll be in and out. - Yeah, that's what you said last time. Wait. Chris. Okay. - Jesus! - Fuck! I thought you were the neighbor. Come put a lock on the gate. Only way the mutt can get in and out of the house. Yeah, I know. He's scared of the stairs. You know. How you been? Haven't seen you forever. - I'm all right, man. - Fuck. - Yeah. - He misses you, too. How's your old man, huh? Is he still teaching? Uh, no, he just retired. - Shit. - Yeah. Mr. Davis. Love that guy. Always gave us smokes, you know. Yeah. Listen, uh... I'm in a little trouble here, man. Oh, fuck. Yeah. No, fuck, come in, come in. All right, let's go inside. Yeah, come on. Get in there, go down the hall, go! Fuck. So, what's going on? Listen, so you, uh... You know, Adams, right? You remember him? - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Well, he, uh... He tried to rob me this morning, man. - What? I thought you guys were buds. - Yeah, down the alley. Yeah, I thought so, too, till he fucking shot his girlfriend. He tried to shoot my little brother. - Fuck. Fuck. - Yeah, he just went off, man. Shot her in the stomach. And me and my little brother we're lucky to get out alive. I don't know what to fucking do. All right, so I'm just thinking... Thinking maybe you could help me out? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - Yeah? Come on, come here, man. Come on. You met Deb, right? Uh, we met a bunch of times, yeah. That's our little girl, Madison. Huh? Jesus Christ! Oh, no, don't worry about that. Have a seat, man. We'll hammer it out. Just give me a sec. Hey, you ever meet Maddie, Chris? Uh... I didn't, no. She's our little miracle. - Yeah. - Aren't ya? Just a little miracle She looks good on you. Okay. Yep. Hey, man. - You got the money? - Yes, what's up? Yeah. Well, he's here. What? What do you mean? I mean, he's in my living room. He just showed up. Yeah. Probably, yeah. You remember, I hired you first okay. But it's gotta cost you 20 now. You fucking told me 10! Well, he said that it's your fault. So, how do I know? Maybe you're lying. They fucking shot me, man! What do you expect? You tried to shoot his little brother! What? No, I never... When? I don't know, this morning? The fucking brother wasn't there this morning. That's not what he said. He said that after you shot your girl in the back, you tried to shoot him and his little brother. So, I don't know. I mean, it's your word against his. And this is an old friend of mine, not some asshole off the street. So... I'm... I'm half conflicted here. Okay, okay, okay. Fine, fuck, it's 20, fine. Just make sure he doesn't fucking leave, you hear me? I'm on my way. And I'm not far. Just hurry up before I change my mind. You were there... on the bike. Just wait a minute. Just, just... You were fucking there! Okay, okay, okay! I was, I was! Look I owe a hundred grand. Okay? And I didn't know where to turn. They gave me a fucking week! All right? And I had a friend with a boat. We did the same thing you guys did. We were stupid. We thought we could avoid the border. But we got robbed and I couldn't cover it. - You piece of shit... - No, no, no, please, please. Look, it was... it was my idea. Chris was just trying to help me. He didn't even want me to come this morning. But I told him that I wouldn't let him do it without me. They would've killed me, all right? He felt like it was his fault. He was just trying to save me. Ah! God and she could cry, Chris, let me tell you, from the moment she woke up, till the moment we put her to bed. And Lizzie wasn't like that. See? Lizzie... Lizzie was a dream. Anyway, this one night... And we hadn't slept in days at this point... Fuckface in there says, "Screw it. I'm getting out of here." And goes over to his buddy's place. Anyway, eventually, he comes back and he goes over to the crib, 'cause we had the crib in there at this point, and he goes over there to give her a kiss. And she's not there. She's sound asleep at this point. Yeah. No, no, I am passed out on the couch. I am gone. So he comes over and shakes me, like, "Where the hell is Maddie?" And, I... I don't know. I thought she was in her crib. Right, so... Well, we started tearing up the house. And we're looking under the beds and in the bathtub. - In the cupboards. - Yeah, we did. We did, actually. - We looked in the cupboards. - What... We looked everywhere. And so finally, he... he looks at me, like, "Well, where the fuck is she? "She didn't just walk out the fucking front door." And I'm like, "Well, she was right here "with me on the couch!" And sure enough, we both turn, and I ran over there, and I reached my hand in and I can feel her little arm. - Jesus. - God! And I haul her out of there. And right away, I start doing CPR. And at this point, I'm crying my eyes out. And he's crying his eyes out, and we're both wrecks. But I just keep blowing. And blowing and blowing. And then all of a sudden, I hear a little cough. God! And I lean back, and that... that is when I hear it, Chris. She starts crying. And to this day, I swear to God, that is the sweetest sound I ever heard. Mommy's little angel. Ain't that nuts? Yeah, that was crazy. You don't want kids, Chris? Uh, no. I don't think so. Hey, man. Can I nab one of those? Didn't know you smoked. Yeah, I don't. Thanks. All right, I'm gonna go change this one. - Nice to see you, Chris. - Yeah, you too. - Can I get... Can I get a light? - Yeah. Oh! This ain't personal. All right? You should've called me first is all. Hey! What are you doing? Where's Jeremy? What did you do with him? Where is he? What about the bag? - Hey! - The bag? Ah... Oh, thank God. - Joe... - Mr. Davis? I need your help. What's happening doesn't matter. Just need your help. Okay, son? I need your help. - Wait! Wait! - Ah! Whoa! Whoa! Relax! Just relax! I told you to that we have the bags. We have them. And we can take you to them right now. What did you do with Lori? She's by a farm. Believe me. She fell off the bike. I... I... I couldn't get her or the bags. So you fucking left her there? - Yeah. - Fucking... If you are lying to me, so help me God, We're gonna take you to the bags. We'll take you there right now. See? See? Hey! Hey! Everything is cool. Okay, okay. You take me to the fucking bags. All right? Let's go. I didn't wanna do this. Okay. I will bring the money back here. You understand me? Okay. Go. Ah... Okay. Fuck. Answer it. Answer it! - Hey. - Where are you? I, uh... I'm with him now. We're going to get the bags. Are you okay? He beat me. My face, man. It's all fucked up. Everything's gonna be all right. I told him.
