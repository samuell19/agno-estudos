SUBTITLES BY TITLES MEDIA Colored by novabros (CAR ENGINE SOUND) (BRAKES SCREECHING) (CAR ENGINE RATTLING) Damn! I'm in trouble. (DIALLING) (PHONE RINGING) Listen. My car broke down on the way. Are you out of your mind? You've got a London flight to catch tomorrow. And you're visiting temples offering prayers. Where are you right now? (TRAIN ENGINE SOUND) I think there's a railway station close by. (BIRS CHIRPING) I see a boy coming. Let me find out. Okay, Lakshmi. Come back home safely. All right. Bye then. Excuse me... Is there a railway station nearby? Yeah, aunty. Can you drop me there? Sure. Hop on. This is a shortcut, aunty. I see. Where do you live, boy? Where are you coming from? I live in a village nearby. I come here for tuition. Oh... What do your parents do? My parents passed away in an accident. Oh... Sorry, dear. Mention not, aunty. My aunt and uncle take good care of me. You're so lucky. All my uncles, aunts and cousins love me dearly. That's great. Hey, man! Look how hot she is. Wow, man! Dear, turn around. Let's leave. Let's get her. Hey! Hey, stop! Pedal faster, boy. Go fast. Stop the cycle, kid! I said stop! Pedal faster. Stop the cycle. You leave, kiddo. Leave me! Let go! Hey, come on! Hey! Let go of her! (GROANING) Help! Help! Being arrogant, huh? (SCREAMS) Aunty, you run. Aunty, escape from here. Don't do that. Stop! Aunty, leave! Aunty, I said run! Run away from here! Run! Run! (PANTING) (TRAIN HORN) (GASPING) 'Tej has killed a man!' (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC) What the hell are you saying? You've got a flight to London tomorrow. And you want to reach out to that kid. What's going on, Lakshmi? I'll have sinned if I don't go. He has saved my life. He'll be imprisoned if I don't confess in court. Lakshmi! We can't ruin our careers by appearing in court. We've worked for a year to find a job in London. You'll have to go to London. I can be anywhere in the world but never find peace. Please listen to me. Let's do something for the kid. All right. As you say. You'll be returning from London in a week. Find the boy's family and give them this cheque. Yes, you're right. You don't worry about it. I'll take care of everything. (FLIGHT TAKES OFF) (POURING HEAVILY) JUDGE: Order! Order! Despite mentioning the reason behind the kid's crime... Due to the absence of justified witness... Tej, a 10 year old native of Jagner... Under Section 321, is sentenced to 7 years in jail. He is hereby ordered to be shifted to a juvenile. Sumitha! Sister! Aunty...! (WEEPING) Tej! Aunty! You don't have to cry, son. You've made no mistake. We are all here for you. Just stay strong. (PLAYING GUITAR) Hmm... Sir! What are you staring at? That kid hasn't got parents. He's my brother's son but I consider him my own. I'm trying my best to bail him out. But the odds are against us. I request you to please look after him. Why are you worked up about this? He's no criminal. He's still a kid. There's nothing to be worried about. I'll take good care of him. Good to hear that. You can leave now. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (BASHING SOUNDS) (UPBEAT MUSIC) (CHEERING) Tej! Tej! Tej! (WHISTLING) What's up, man? You danced so good. Thanks, man. Impressed with your performance, the HOD is here to meet you. Hi, Tej! Congratulations! Thank you so much, sir. These are my friends from Hyderabad. They sing in my uncle's band. I also join them sometimes. They were specially invited for our college event. Hi, guys! Tomorrow is our 'Hostel Day'. You should all be there. Actually, sir... I was leaving to my hometown this evening. But why? It's my brother's birthday tomorrow. Oh... Happy birthday in advance. Thank you so much, sir. And they are... My elder sister, younger sister and cousins... Hi! Oh... It's not just his birthday tomorrow. Our summer vacation also starts tomorrow. No matter where our family is throughout the year... We meet on this particular day. Our uncle makes sure we do. (GIGGLES) Hey! Don't move! UNCLE: Stand still, will you? You're still as naughty. (BRAKES SCREECHING) Welcome, love. How are you, dad? How's my son-in-law? Come. How are you, dear? I'm fine, mom. (GIGGLES) Greetings, uncle.

Don't leave without blessing the couple. Sure. Will do. Greetings... Greetings, sir... (LAUGHS) Wake up, everyone! The auspicious time is here. Wake up! (WEDDING BELLS) Listen! Huh? You forgot the vermillion. (DOOR KNOCK) Brother! Brother! Just wait. Brother! We've been betrayed. My daughter has eloped with someone. What is he saying? Have you gone mad? What the hell are you saying? She must be somewhere around. Look properly. Three men entered our house at midnight. She ran away with them. Tej! Tej! Oh, Lord! He's done all of this, brother. (INTENSE MUSIC) The guy I know nothing about... Tej got her married to that guy only. (BIKE ENGINE SOUND) (FOOTSTEPS RECEDE) Uncle, they were both in love with each other. So what? Doesn't mean you get them married. No, uncle. This alliance was fixed when she was a kid. When she was foolish to fall in love with someone... You were supposed to get some sense into her. But you helped her elope and get married. Damn it! You embarrassed us by going to jail as a kid. Brother! Hey! You've embarrassed us yet again by ruining the wedding. How can we lead a respectful life now? How do I answer the in-laws? Tell me! Why are you questioning him? Your elder brother compelled him to do so. He's pretending to be innocent now. (GROANING) Hey! Hey! Hey! What the hell are you doing? Let him go! Hey! (INDISTINCT NOISES) How dare you abuse my in-law in my presence? Brother! I understand everything now. I get that I have zero respect in this house. Uncle, forgive me, please. Listen to me. Stop it! I see your real side now. Brother, you're responsible for his behaviour. I'm done with all of you. Listen to me at least. I want nothing to do with this family. Let's get out of here. You haven't shown any respect to the man's age. You've shattered the family into pieces. You'll never set foot in this house again. Get out! Get out! (SINGING RANDOMLY) Hey! Morning, seniors! Come on, get going! Hey, man! I'd spend hours at college until now. We're done with our diploma now. What do I do now? You've still got your backlogs, sir. Here's your ticket, sir. Where's mine? What do you need it for, sir? Your village is quite nearby. Hey, man... Didn't you know this? His uncle kicked him out of the house before a year. He's been living with his other uncle in Hyderabad since then. Seriously, sir? Ask him. Sorry, sir. I'll go get you a ticket to Hyderabad right now. Please do that. Sure, sir. A guy proposed to me yesterday. Wow! That's great. I slapped him with my slipper. Is it? Oh, my! I've got a doubt, bro. What is it, huh? Why do girls respond to guys' proposals with their slippers? That's because a guy's love equals God. What do you mean? It's just like removing slippers before entering a temple. You're of another level, man. You think so? Give me a minute. (DIALLING) He's calling someone. (TRAIN HORN) What's up? Did you leave? Yeah, I did. I've been trying real hard to impress a girl. But it's not working out. Give me an idea, bro. Idea? It's quite easy to impress girls. Do something. Roam around a girl for about three days. Give her as much attention as possible. Follow her on the fourth day as well. But when she notices you, look away. You can't expect how disturbed she's going to be. When she notices me... Hello? Say something, man. I'm talking to you. Hello! Hello? Are you there? (UPBEAT MUSIC) Hey, uncle! Why don't you sit down? (INHALES DEEPLY) Damn! She's staring at me. (TRAIN HORN) (WHISTLING) Hey! Stop staring. Everyone's looking. Grandpa... Tell me, dear. Huh! Will you complain on me? Go ahead. She's blind?! Grandpa... Let's go. (TRAIN HORN) 'My first love story is a blind love story!' (SINGING RANDOMLY) Who are you, dear? Why'd you do that? Grandpa! Guys assume it's easy to impress girls. That is why I've taught him a lesson for life. (TRAFFIC NOISES) How does my coffee taste? How many times have I asked you to put some coffee powder in it? I've learnt from YouTube to make coffee without coffee powder. That is why it tastes like this. I've posted the same on Facebook and received 500 likes. One can't taste the coffee on Facebook. Got it? (SCOFFS) (PHONE RINGING) Hello! Crazy Boyz Music Troupe... Hello, uncle. Is Tej there? (PHONE RINGING) Hello, uncle. Is Tej there? (PHONES RINGNG OFF THE HOOK) What's happening? I'm the most famous singer in the city. But I seldom receive any calls. He reached the city last night. And he's already got 60 people calling. I wonder what he's upto. One needs to have fans to receive phone calls. Come on! It's 9'o clock already. How many times have I told you early risers are successful? Really? If that was the case, newspaper deliver boys would be rich. Well said, son! He's right, dear. If drinking milk made one powerful, even a cat would've been wild. Wow! That was your punch line? I can do better. If practice helped one's music, I would've been a music director by now. (GIGGLES) Uncle, you just took a dig at yourself. I was out of flow. You've come home after so long. Shall I make sour chicken rice for you? What? Sour chicken rice? It tastes so good. How do you make it, aunty? First, we need to pluck the feathers off a hen. We should chop it off into pieces... Uh-huh? Let it soak in a vessel of tamarind water. Wow! My mouth is watering. I know, right? Cook it right now and serve it to uncle. Order food from a hotel for me, please. Hey! Uncle! (LAUGHS) You two are making fun of me, huh? (PHONE RINGING) Who is it, man? It's me! Brother! How are you doing? I'm good. How are Sudha and Ishu? They're both fine, brother. Did you reserve the tickets? It's done, brother. We're leaving in a week. All right. Brother, actually... Tell me. Tej finished his studies and came to Hyderabad. Do we bring him along? What happened, dear? He hung up. Uh-oh! He hangs up whenever we mention Tej. Is it wrong to get a couple married? He was in jail for 7 years as a kid. He's stayed in a hostel for 2 years later. Is he going to stay away forever now? Let's take him along this time. Convince your brother somehow. Let's try. (SIGHS) (WHISTLING) What's wrong? Don't you girls have college to attend? One of our seniors rags us. She forces us to smoke cigarettes. (LAUGHS) She's ragging you, huh? How could you laugh at your sister being ragged? Eh? What do you expect me to do? What makes you think seniors would be nice to you? Brother! (UPBEAT MUSIC) Hmm! Who is she? Tell me. Give me her details. Listen! I don't know what you're going to do. But I won't be the one smoking. She'll smoke and I'll watch. We need to teach her what torture feels like. Just wait and watch how badly I'll torture her. This is just the advance. Get the balance amount ready. Stop talking and get to work. Go! Ah! Okay. Hey! Huh? I'll send you the girl's picture. Sure, do that. What says, guys? My attire will scare her, right? Whoa! Sure! Hello, sir. Hello. Tej! They think I'm a real cop. My dad's uniform has been useful. We look like cops but you haven't told us what the plan is. We'll make the girl smoke and make that video go viral. Hey! Are you all set? Hmm... All set. Have you got her details? Platform no. 8, Godavari Express, Coach S4, dressed in blue... (UPBEAT MUSIC) Whoa! This means she isn't blind. She's fooled me badly. Hey! Show me the girl's picture. (CAMERA FLASH) She fooled me the other day. She fooled around with my sister recently. I'm not going to let you go today. (INHALES SHARPLY) Hey! Police! Listen. He's really dangerous. We are scared as hell looking at him. Please do as he says. I'll scream, huh. I'll stab you, eh. I've got no cash on me. I don't want your money. What do you want then, sir? Please! Give me that. Smoke this. No, sir. I don't smoke. Hey! Just do it! Please, sir. I'll stab you. Just do it! What are you making me do, sir? (LAUGHS) (UPBEAT MUSIC) If we don't stop her, she'll go overboard with it. Done, sir. It's over. It's over, sir. Are you done, sir? Wasn't that too much? Hey! Get lost! I'll now play the video of your senor that rags you. Share this video with your friends and it'll go viral. And your senior will be insulted. Thanks, bro! Great job! (EVIL LAUGH) I asked him to rag my senior. But he ragged some random girl for my money. Sister, your senior was a common person in both our lives. Hey! How dare you rag my sister? I'll kill you! And the balance amount... I'm not going to pay you. Huh? Why? Why won't you give me the money? No way! But why? She's not my senior. Hey! Blue dress, Coach S4... You sent us all these details. Dressing in blue doesn't make her my senior. Hey, look! This is cheating. What do you think of yourself, huh? You better give my money. Hey! Hey! Why are you being so loud? Do you know how much I spent on making that video? Hmm... That doesn't make it useful to me. I'm not paying. Will you stop already? Tell me what you guys are fighting about. Look, dad. I paid him to rag my senior and he ragged some other girl. Who's that girl? Take a look for yourself. Huh?! She's the girl you ragged? Huh! She is the Police Commissioner's daughter. Huh? Commissioner's daughter? Yeah, dad. He's also an encounter specialist. Yeah, love. He's an encounter specialist. Some guy ragged her this one time and her dad shot him. That's right. Yeah. Didn't you know? Why'd you make the Commissioner's daughter smoke? You think I'm scared of the Commissioner's daughter? Why are your hands shivering then? Hey! Hey! Yes! Hey! He did this for you, right? Why are you pulling his leg now? Your lovely son had me pay for this. Huh? Huh! (PHONE RINGING) When's the party, bro? You fool! I asked you for the girl's picture. Whose picture did you show me? You asked me to click her picture and I did. How am I mistaken? You think you're some photographer, huh? She's the Commissioner's daughter. All the lines to this route are busy. Please try after some time. Hey! Hey! Hey! You're going to be smacked, you idiot! (LAUGHS) Yes! Hey! You get inside. Listen, dear. I'm really scared. What if the Commissioner found him? Don't worry. She's not the Commissioner's daughter. Really? Huh... You only wanted to take Tej along with us. Maybe this will scare him to join us on the trip. You smart fella! Who's that girl by the way? Who knows? Nandini... Nandini! Nandini! Come on! Sir! Sir! Sir! Judge wants to see you. Hello, sir. Sir, this girl ran over me and my dog Tommy with her bike. Your Honour, my client has done it accidentally. She hasn't planned it. So I request you to relieve my client, Your Honour. You tell me, dear. I was driving my bike. This dog found a biscuit on the road. It came running and under my bike. This old man was chasing after the dog. I hit them as I lost control. Why, dear? Your bike hasn't got brakes? It does and that is why the old man is alive. This old man would've been dead otherwise. Rest in peace. What the hell! Why do you keep referring to him as old man? 'Oh! He's also an old man. I totally forgot.' This girl named Chalasani Nandini… …has accepted being guilty of hitting Mr. Ramaswamy with her bike. So, for the purpose of hospital feel for him and his dog… She should pay 2000 rupees. It is my verdict. And for making fun of old people. She should spend 15 days at an old age home. And 15 days at animal center for hurting the dog. My verdict is that she should serve those poor animals. (VOICE ECHOING) Come on. Give me money. Hey! Auto man is better than you. Is it? Get an injection for Snoopy and come home tomorrow. Hey… I will give you the waiting charges. Please come inside. Okay. You may go inside. I will come. Snoopy! Is it a hospital or a five star hotel? What is this? Why are you taking so long? You should give bath to 10 dogs. You have to groom 6 cats. You have to do brushing for 3 horses. Make it fast. O' my God! There are 10 more dogs? Hmm. I will give you money whatever you ask. Set me free from this service. No! The lady constable here is very strict. She makes sure that people who received the punishment are here. She takes updates on your their progress. But, I can help you. How? Bring someone in your place. I will manage the rest of it. Who will agree to do this? Are you that innocent? You look so beautiful. Can't you find a fool? That's fine. But, where will I find such a fool all of a sudden? 'The guy in the train.' Brother! That is Commissioner's daughter. I guess the commissioner must have come. I will leave. Why are you scared? What's your mistake? I will go and talk to her. Wait. Hi. Hi. Do you remember him? He made you smoke at the station yesterday. Yeah. But, how do you know? I am his sister. He's the same guy. 'I couldn't recognize him.' Actually, you might be so angry that you feel like killing him. Hmm. 'Idiot.' You must be angry just for 2 days. But, I've been angry for almost 15 years. He has a habit of taking bribes for everything since childhood. That's me. I told him that you are commissioner's daughter. Is it? You should tell him the same. I request you. Please. 'She is pleading her to save me.' 'I would've demanded for more commission if I knew that she loves me so much.' Please… Please! Get up… Please get up. Don't leave him. Okay. Don't worry about it. I will take care of your brother. 'Why are coming to me like a good?' 'Didn't my sister's sentiment work?' What happened? Why are you so scared? Yeah. I know that she is commissioner's daughter. Aren't you scared of commissioner's daughter? Will she kill me if she is commissioner's daughter? 'I will kill.' Yes, dad. I will kill him. Dad! He is here. Come fast. He will leave if you delay. You should encounter him. Please come fast. Excuse me. What is it? Sorry, madam. Are you saying sorry? How dare you? You made me smoke. It is impossible for you to escape. Is it wrong take revenge for my sister? Huh? That's me! Moreover, you took money from your sister. Didn't you? Yes! 'I will teach you a lesson.' Just wait. Let me call my dad. Madam… Madam. Let us compromise. I will do whatever you ask me to. Will you do it? Hmm. Well, you look good. Do you have a girlfriend? Really? O' my goodness! 'Idiot.' Then, will you become my boyfriend 15 days and listen to me? What is this? Does it happen that way? What is like being a boyfriend for 15 days? Huh? Girls might get used to a spa. If they like it after feeling the essence of it… Then, they will come again and again to get a massage. Otherwise, they will never visit that spa again. It is simple as that. Is it? That's true, buddy. Last time, a girl asked me to come to her hostel in Ameerpet. She asked me apply dye for her. Hey! Old ladies apply dye. Not girls. See how he talks about it. Don't be silly, buddy. You've got a golden chance to let her feel the essence of it. Don't lose this opportunity. Buddy! You are so lucky. I got the oil too. It belongs to my grandpa. I requested my mom and brought it. You are so lucky, man. Hi. Hi. Are they your friends? Hi. Think that way. You forgot, right? It is getting late. Come. Hey. Did you tell them about us? Okay. (PRAISING GOD) Why did we come here? I will tell you. Get down. Do you know what that biggest crime in this world is? Tej! What is the biggest crime in this world? People get rid of their parents when they become old. I am habituated to serve such people since childhood. Wow… You are so great. You are not ordinary. You shall be protected! I just said that to feel good. Nandini! Nandini. What happened, Rahul? Is he Rahul? Sit… I had leg pain all night. Is it? I am unable to bear it. It is okay. Applying oil and giving massage will be smoothening. Tej! Give me the bottle. Which bottle? The one that your friend gave you. You hid it at the back. That bottle. 'How does she know about it?' Hey! Why are giving it to me? Sit here. Grandpa is hurt. Come on. Give him a massage. Come on. Come on… Come on…come on… Come on! What, man? Call me when the bottles get over. I will bring a can. End the call. Hey, boys and girls. By boyfriend will come to work instead of me from tomorrow. Gosh! Hey! We came here yesterday, right? Why now? Tej! Won't you have lunch if you have the breakfast in the morning? What happened? Tej! What happened? That means I should go there in the morning and come here in the evening. Yeah. Yeah. Hey! Did you give bath to all the dogs? Yeah. 'I asked you to brush the horse's teeth. Get up.' 'My leg hurts. Give me a massage, dear.' No… I will not do it. No! Save me. Tej! I will never make chicken curry again. Hey! I am unable to bear that commissioner daughter's torture. Hey! She is not commissioner's daughter. This is your uncle and Yashu's drama. Drama? Three! Maria! Stop it. Who is it? Hey! Why are you letting down such a good song? No one appreciates good songs these days. What? What did you say? Did you sing it well? You! This is just an act, right? Do you know that I am a famous guitarist? Hmm? Play C minor. I am not a minor. I am a major. Silly fellow! Play it. 'That means this is going on depending this guy alone.' What is the name of your troupe? Crazy boys music troupe of India! Yeah. We will soon create an album representing India. What is this? We are practicing for merchant daughter's event, right? Uncle said the same thing. I understood… Tell me this. Should I keep on searching for you? What are you doing here without going to the old age home? Why should I go? Why won't you go? What is it? You talk too much. Your body language has changed. Did you forget who I am? Did you forget? Did you forget? Who are you? Commissioner's daughter. I'll give you one. Don't say that you are commissioner's daughter. I will smack you. Go away. 'He's dead!' Oh! Did you found out everything? Okay, dear. Recall whatever happened that day. 'What happened?' Will you become my boyfriend 15 days and listen to me? Will you come out for a coffee? Not just a coffee shop. I will go to Kanyakumari as well. Yeah. We went to the coffee shop. Try to recall what happened after that. 'What happened after that?' 'Where did this girl go?' Where did you go? I will tell you. You are very handsome. You'd ignore me if you find a girl more beautiful than me. So, what? You have to sign this agreement to keep the trust. Just 15 days. For the sake of trust? Silly girl. You've signed this, right? Take it and read it. Read it. No. Not me. Can you read? You read it. Come on. I, Mr. Tej! With my whole senses… With my hands… I write this note to Miss Nandini. For playing casino in Goa… For cricket betting… For playing cards with friends… Going out with girls to the pub… Going out with aunts to the club… I bought a sports bike and an iPhone. For all those expenses… I took 25 lakhs from Miss Nandini for 1 rupee interest. Nandini can use me in any manner until I fulfill the debts. She has that right on me. All the rights belong to Miss Nandini. I am writing in here. Yours loving, Tej! Hey you! Don't you watch movies? The original document is in the locker. The fake copy can also be uploaded in Facebook. Superb idea! I will post that right away. Hey! If she files at the court… According to section 423 and 232, you might go to the prison. Tell me. What should I do? Listen! I just used free time until now. But, if you talk too much… You should be available 24 x 7 whenever I call you and come to me. You should do whatever I ask you to. One more condition! I will kill you if I see you playing music with a music troupe ever again. Particularly, if I see that fatso holding a guitar… Then, I'll finish you. Let's go. Proposal pen… (VENDING) Just one left! Pen… Hey, boy! Come here. What do you want, sis? This pen looks different. This is a proposal pen, sis. It is for guys. It is not for you. What do you mean that it is for guys? Girls will threaten them whenever a boy proposes a girl. So… It will start recording once you press the button. You can listen to it when you press it again. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you. I love you… I love you… Hey… Stop it. How long will you show the demo? It's awesome. Give me one. I might like someone and feel like proposing them. It will be useful then. Why do you need one, sis? You already have a boyfriend. Hey! No one will give it to him. I will give it to someone whom I like. Hey!

Murthy went to UK for the cricket league. He'd be busy with players there. You cannot get him. Didn't I give you his number last time? He is not picking my calls, sir. I have the same number. Please, sir. Try to do something. Do one thing. He'll come for the Vizag cricket league on the 20th of this month. You can go there and meet him. Thank you so much, sir. Don't worry, dear. We are finding him, right? Mr. Murthy will solve your problem. Today is 1st. It is just 20 days. Let's wait. Meanwhile, I will send my people and try to find something. Thank you so much, sir. I am giving you trouble. So sorry, sir. What for? I know you as a child. Take care. Dear. Yes, sir. Did we get the call? No. Not now. Hey! Someone of you go by the other gate. We shouldn't miss Nandini this time. We should be ready to do anything for it. Hello. Where are you? What weren't picking up my call? How many times should I call you? Where are you? What don't you say something? Tell me. Yeah! I am here. I am coming. I asked you to come here, right? When did I say? I will go to the court if you don't come here in 5 minutes. Are you coming or not? 'I should show him my power.' 'Idiot!' Nandini madam. 'He will not stay away from me.' Wait, madam. Madam. Hey, Nandini. Hey! Follow her. Go… Go! Hop on. Go fast. Make it fast. Yeah! I am going. Okay. Hey! Drive fast. Please. Why should I drive fast? I will tell you later. Just go. Okay. Hey! Drive fast. Why did you bring me here? I will tell you. Get down. Who were they? Why are they following us? Who? I don't know. Is it? Let's relax here for 5 minutes. Hey. Hey! They came here. Please go. Please… Please. They came here. Please. Please let us go from here. Hey! Nandini will not come to us if we ask her nicely. We should tense her up. Who are they? Please. They are from my village. They are forcing me for the wedding. That is why… That is why they are after me. Hmm? Hmm. Hey! Take her away. Please… Please. Let's go away from here. Please…Please. Please save me. I will do whatever you ask me to. Will you do whatever I ask you to? Yes. I will do it. Will you sign my documents? 'He's smart.' But, there are no documents, right? They're ready. 'He came with them.' I've been waiting for this situation from many days. Hmm. But, this is blank. Won't you sign then? Let's relax then. I am signing it. Do it. Hey! Go, grab her and come. I did it, boss. Did you sign all the papers? Hmm. Start being my girlfriend, baby. Give it… 'Pass the ball. What are you doing?' 'What energy!' 'Buddy! What are you doing?' Goal! Come on. What have you done? Hey! Pass me the ball. What's the use in passing you the ball? The girl is here. Go and start working. Good morning, boss. Hey! Why are you late? Should I wait for you every day? There's a traffic jam, boss. Is it? Get me the ball. Where is the ball? Go and find it. Brother! Where is the ball? Brother! Where is the ball? Hey! Tell me where the ball is. Hey. Brother! Where is the ball? Is it there? Thanks, brother. Ball, boss. I asked you to come at 7 am, right? Go and get Tea for everyone. Go… Okay, boss. Money! What? Do you need money? You! Hello. Buddy. Tell me. Buddy. Tell me. My girlfriend broke up with me and is going to Singapore. Her company promised to give 5 lakhs hike on salary. That is why she is going away from me. Good thing happened. I told you to marry her to be happy. You didn't listen to me. What did you say? Living together… Face it now. She tied Rakhi to you that day. She will listen to you. I don't know what you will do. You have to stop her from going to Singapore. That's it. Hey! How can I come in the last moment? I have an exam at 2 pm. How will you pass that paper? Hey! I didn't pass for the first attempt. That is why I am writing again. Buddy! I will give up my life if you do not stop her. Hey! Stop crying. Let's do something. Both of you meet me at the continental hospital in one hour. Okay, buddy. Did you give it to everyone? Hmm. Sit. Where, boss? Should I read out the document? Sit. Accept it. Please. It is just for 30 minutes. Hey! Is it a hospital or a drama company? Listen! There is a small issue. I have to solve it. Please. Who is the patient, by the way? She is the one. Me? Oh! Doctor! Give them the ICU for one hour. Okay, sir. Hey! What's going on here? Sssh! Listen! You shouldn't talk for 5 minutes. Hey! Are they coming? I am so happy to see her like this. Hey. Are you giving her a shock treatment? Haven't you tied her hands? Sorry. Why do you do it all the time? Why didn't he tie her hands? What must have happened, Madhu? I don't know anything. Let's see. Brother! What happened? My wife tried to commit suicide. Wife? When did you marry? Listen! They're living together just like us. Don't stop the flow. You say, buddy. She works for Google. She was offered 1 lakh salary hike to go Australia. I forced her to go. Do you know what Nandu said? How can I leave you for 1 lakh? I am not that cheap. I belong to a decent family. 1 lakh is not needed. 5000 rupees is enough. I will kill him and go to Australia. I didn't listen to her. I did her signature and mailed the letter to her company. She attempted suicide when she got to know that. He is lying a lot. Listen! Don't send my sister if she gets an offer like that. She might get ready to die if she had to leave you. I cannot withstand that. No, brother. I am also from a decent family. It is not my character to be greedy for money. I will not go to Singapore. Sheila. I will not go even if you ask me to. You've made me realize, brother. I will meet sister-in-law. I will tell her. I will tell her. She is sleeping. You got emotional. Take her. Take my sister and go. You come. Go… Hey! Have you cancelled the plan to go to Singapore? What are you saying, buddy? How does he know? No… His girlfriend ran away with someone. Let's go. What did you do? How dare you! Hey! Don't take an advantage of it and make plans to marry me. I will kill you. Do you get it? What do you think of yourself? I have used you to my work. So, will you let me do all this? I am silent because I signed the agreement. Otherwise… What will you do otherwise? Otherwise… What will you do otherwise? Did you see my friend who came now? He loved that girl very badly. He will die if she leaves him. I did this drama to save their love. I didn't mean to hurt you. I would've written whatever I want if I really plan to use you. But, my heart didn't let me do that. Do you know why? I love you a lot. I felt it when I saw you for the first time. You asked me to act like your boyfriend. I became your boyfriend in real. I did whatever you asked with love. I did it for my love. I love you, Nandu. Come to me tell tomorrow if you like me.

'Why did you deceive me? Why?' Lakshmi! Why did you come out? You have breathing problem, right? Why did you deceive me? Please, sir. Lakshmi! Everyone is watching us. Can we talk later? What is there to talk now? A kid saved my life 15 years ago. I asked you to help him. But, what have you done? Lakshmi! Try to understand. I asked you many times and you said that you helped him. I trusted you. But, you didn't do anything. That kid was imprisoned for 7 years. Lakshmi! Leave it. He just did a small favor. Should you spend a lot of him for that? I haven't done anything for my sake. Everything is under our daughter's name. How can you be so selfish? To save my life, he… Hey! Lakshmi! Lakshmi! Lakshmi! Yeah, dad. We did all kind of tests. I don't know what the problem is. Mom. Mom. Nandini. Your father deceived me. ( Go to India. Try somehow to meet him. My mom didn't forget you. She thought about until her last breathe. Say this to him. Tell him that I asked him for an apology. Will you fulfill my wish? I am going to India. I will find him and fulfill my mom's last wish. You've bought property on my name, right? I will give that to him. What do you mean? How can you give it to him? You must've bought it for me. But, it belongs to him according to me. Your mom is crazy. Have you gone crazy? I gave that site to someone else. I took the advance. Mom told me before dying that she couldn't help him because of you. She remembered him all the time. She should be relieved from that grief. For her soul to rest in peace… I should go and meet him. Not just that. I enjoyed mom's love because of him. So, he has that right. You will not go to India. Get it? 'I want to go to India.' 'I will go for sure.' Hello. Sir! I am calling to discuss about that land in Vizag. Yes. That is why I came to India. You already took 10 crores in advance. There is no response. No… That site belongs to you. You can confirm. Okay. Sure, sir. Hello, bike. What is your boss writing inside? Excuse me, sir. Please. Hello! Yes. Sir! There is a guy named Tej inside. Can you call him out? Should I call him? This is an exam that's going on here. 'Tej! I fell in love with you.' 'How can I hold it in my heart this long?' 'I cannot hide it like how you did.' 'So, I came to express it now.' 'Write your exam later. Come out first.' 'I love you… I love you!' 'I will fail even this time.' 'I don't understand why the questions that I prepare don't appear here.' Sir. What happened now? Sir. This is a letter. How dare you! I thought that only guys cheat in the exam. Even girls are into cheating now. That too, you're giving it to a professor. 'You fool!' Tej! Tej! Tej! (HONKING) Tej! Tej! Tej. Hey! What happened to Nandini? What happened to Nandini? Hey! Tell me what happened to Nandini. Karthik! You tell me what happened to Nandini. Hey! Why doesn't anyone say something? Hey. They frightened me. I was worried. Do you love her? Yeah. Why? I don't know why you guys are bothering me. I can't recall why I came to India. Please don't ask me the same question again and again. Now, just leave me alone. I need to see my mom. Doctor! Please. I need to talk to my dad. Doctor! At least you tell them. Doctor? Of course, he is a doctor. Sir! Can you please give me your phone? I need to speak to my dad. What happened to her? She forgot that she came to India. 'We tried a lot.' 'She talks about her dad who is in London.' 'But, she doesn't say anything about you.' 'She completely forgot you.' Nandini. Dad. Dad! Where is mom? Come with me. I'll tell you. Nandini. It is lacunar amnesia. She had a head injury. So, her memory storage tissues are damaged. That is why her memory is lost permanently. She can remember everything. But, she cannot recall something that happened for a particular period. It varies in patients. Some people lose 5 years of memory. Some people lose 2 years of memory. Let's talk about your daughter Nandini. She lost 3 months and 12 days of her memory. That includes the death of her mother and her comeback to India. Everything that happened before the accident is erased from her memory. Her brain is 100 percent perfect. Her health condition is also good. Sir! Your daughter forgot whatever is needed to be forgotten. Shut up. Find out where she kept the documents. We have to sell the site, right? She might get suspicious if we ask her now. Let's take her to London first. Let's go. But, sir! Listen to me. Let's talk about it later. Nandini! Let us go. Dad. What happened, dear? I came here to fulfill my mom's wish, right? Of course! Is there any doubt? Should I call the person that you met in India? Let it be, dad. You said it. So, it must be true. I don't want to meet anyone. Let's go to London directly. (PHONE RINGING) Hello. Tej! Sister wants to talk to you. Tej! Aunt! What happened to you? Nothing happened to me, aunt. Don't I know about my son? You are very sad. No, aunt. I am fine. I feel like seeing you. Come here once, dear. Not now, aunt. It might be an issue if uncle finds out. I will come some other time. 'Come just for once.' Hmm. Bye. Calm down, sister. He will come. What happened? Why didn't you all go to the ground? How can we go to the ground when you're like this? Hmm? How can we go to the ground when you're like this? Hey! Just chill, buddy. How can I just chill? We know that you did a lot for her. Let's do something. Let's go to Nandini and tell her everything that has happened. You've seen her at the hospital. Didn't you? She couldn't recognize me. Then, how will she recognize my love? Moreover, doctor said she cannot recall everything again. What shall we do now? Will you be able to forget her? It is tough, buddy. God has given her a memory loss. It would be good if there's a way to erase feelings from heart as well. Yeah…I am coming. Sorry…Sorry. Are you blind? Can't you see? Sorry, sir. You are…? Why did you try to abduct Nandini that day? Her father sent me to bring Nandini. Hey! Why will her father do such thing? I don't know. He asked me to injure her and take her to him. Why so? I don't know all that. But, he was tensed because he might lose the property if she's not found. What property? Whose property? I don't know anything other than this, sir. We are not goons. We work for his friend's company in India. I can you show you my Aadhar card if you want. Sir! I've got kids. Hey! Get lost. Thank you, sir. Get lost. 'That means Nandini's issue is her dad.' 'That is why she came back to India.' Hello. Buddy! Nandini's father is taking her to London. What shall we do now? 'Hello?' 'Hello?' Come on, dear. Make it fast. We're getting late to catch our flight. I have no idea when will I come to India again. Just give me 5 minutes. Hmm. Okay. Okay. This is okay. Hey! Come fast. That girl is coming. Listen, dear. We don't have much time. The airport is very far. Yeah. I know that, dad. I will take just one bag. Please. Hey! That is Nandini. Alright! Go. Madam…You are Nandini, right? Yeah. Ma'am! Please give me your autograph. Nandini ma'am. Who are all of you? Madam…Please madam. Give me your autograph. Madam! You're the singer of 'Crazy Boys' troupe, right? We love your song, madam. We die for your song, madam. Madam! Your voice is similar to Shreya Goshal in the movie. Please madam. Give me your autograph. Who are you? Go away from here. Sir…Cool down. We are from ABT College. Vizag, sir. Sir! Do you know? Nandini madam is famous in our college. She sang for our college's event as well. Please, sir. Let me take one selfie. Please, sir. Dad! They're asking for my autograph. Did I really…? They are your acquaintances I believe. They are trying to take an advantage. Come with me, dear. I took a selfie with Tej sir. I want to take one with you as well. Tej? Who is Tej? Tej, madam. He is the owner of 'Crazy Boys' troupe. See! He's the one. 'Who is Tej?' Go! It's time for your entry. Hey! Come…Come back. What are you doing? Make a way. Go away. Madam… Good news to our audience! We got to know that the famous singer Nandini is here. Go away. Madam…Please madam. Give us just one bite. Do it for your fans. Madam. Give a bite for our channel, madam. Please go away. Go away. Madam! I am from Maya TV. No… Madam, one bite. Please madam. Madam! Please. Go. I am from Maya TV. Take us to the airport fast. No, dad. I want to meet 'Crazy Boys' music troupe. Okay, ma'am. I want to meet Tej. Tej. Tej! Tej. Won't you talk with me? Talk with you? Why will he talk with you? Hey! What have you done? We practice music like a family. But, you failed to recognize him when he came to see you at the hospital. It's a medical miracle. You know? I lost my memory because of an accident. Did you forget to have food? Did you forget to sleep? How can you forget Tej like that? How? Do you know how hurt we are? I can't believe this. God! This must be crazy. Stop it, man. What is your problem? Actually! I don't know what to say. But, I somehow feel like joining your troupe. Listen! Don't do that. Why? The entire programme is a flop because of you. I fired you. Listen! Remove her picture from the hoarding. Yes. We shall remove it. It's done… Please don't disturb again. Hey mister! Mind your words. I will teach him a lesson. You would understand my feelings if you're in my shoes, sir. I became a state singer from a street singer. Many companies wanted me to do an album. Nandini joined the troupe by requesting us. She was the main singer and she practiced too. There's a tour in Vizag after 15 days. What can we do if she suddenly doesn't remember anything? Why are you talking to her, buddy? Go away from here. Do you think that we cannot find another singer? Leave now. Idiots! Let's go, dear. Come. Let's go. Didn't I do the right thing? I tell you. Let's go with plan B. Nandini! Good that you're here. I am from Maya TV. Give us one bite, madam. Hey! Why are you following us everywhere? Go away from here. Why are you saying that, sir? Your daughter is the lead singer for the next music album. Madam…Please. You! Dad. Madam! Please give us one bite. Madam. Please madam. Just one bite. What should I say? Nandini! Let's go. I understood everything, dad. I loved music since my childhood. I must've fulfilled my wish before meeting this guy. I must've joined their group and became famous. Whatever you think hasn't happened. Look at his face. He looks like he hasn't eaten anything for months. Particularly, look at that fatso. Does he look like a musician? Listen to me. This is just a waste of time. Let's go. Please, dad. It is just for 15 days. I will come after finishing the show. No, dear. I will not agree. Let's go now. Don't force her too much. She will remember everything if she gets any doubt. Okay, dear. You can go. Tej. I will sing in your group. I will come for the practice for 15 days. You will come? You won't come. You will meet with an accident again. What will happen to us if you lose your memory? Say, madam. I will sign the agreement if you want. She didn't change at all even after losing her memory. Show me the agreement. I will come for the practice from tomorrow. Hmm. Okay? Bye. Hmm. Stop it. What happened, buddy? Listen! She agreed to stay with us for 15 days. Find out why she came to India and what her problem is in these 15 days. Does it mean that there isn't any love story? What's the problem when you try for a little but you receive a lot? Then, allow us to make a plan. You just follow it. Understand? Okay. Hi. I am telling you. Obey my order. Come on, guys. Come out. I will smack you. Come out of it. Who composed this? Oh! What's the scale that I should follow? Small or big scale. Pick whatever you want. Where should I get the scales from? Go out. Please, buddy. Get out. Now! Okay, guys. I'll be back. Photo… Just a small break, ma'am. Please. Okay. Yes. Harsh! Yeah. What happened, Nandini? This picture? This is one of those sweet memories of your story. Tej saw you in a train for the first time. He tried to talk to you. But, you didn't give him a chance. That poor guy tried a lot. He made a plan to attract you. Plan is made. Hey! Excuse me. How do I look? Ah? You might look like anything. How does it matter to me? Nothing, madam. I want to propose to a girl. Do it if you want. Why are you telling me? That is because a beautiful girl like you will have an amazing taste. Give me few tips and I will flatter her easily. Remove this floral shirt and wear something classy. Remove your bottom and wear jeans. Okay, madam. What's that? You hair looks like a nest. Go for a haircut. And that beauty spot. Remove it. You have to change your body language. Listen to romantic songs. You will look good after that. Any girl will easily get impressed. Okay, madam.

Did you lock the room? No, buddy! I forgot. Buddy! You know, right? Tej doesn't like it when someone enters the room. That is because there are many lovely memories in that room. Hey! End the call. Hey…I forgot. Oh no! I will end it. No! Hey. No. No. No. No! Harsh! Please. Please listen to me. Tell me something about this picture. Please, Harsh. Please tell me. Hey! I will kill you if you do not say it. I will tell you… We were doing music programmes and something happened one day. That day… Who wants this 2000 rupees note? 'Me…I want it.' 'I want it…' Who wants this 2000 rupees note? 'Me…' Thanks, sister. 'Oh!' 'Oh, no!' Did you see that? Everyone raised their hands when I asked. But, Bunty took it away from me. Why haven't you all taken it from me? We thought that you were kidding. I thought about it and that kid came before me. Life is similar to it. Someone might take the things you like before you do. That is why you shouldn't hold anything to your heart. You have to express it. Take whatever you like. Be it money or love. Sister! Tej asked me to take that note from you. Hey… Tej! I love you. Why didn't you tell me that day about this? It would be embarrassing to make you remember everything after you forgot. That is why… Tej refused to say it. ♪ You!

This is wrong. Why did you lie? Hey! It is true that you proposed Nandini before the accident. There's a chance that she might accept your proposal. Just think if it happens in real. Listen, bro. True love never fails. Nandini may not remember anything. But, love remains in her heart. Our plan is to make her recall that love. Tej! Nandini will not come back if she leaves. Whatever we do, we should do it within these 15 days. Otherwise, you will have to repent all your life. No, buddy. Listen to me. It won't be good if we do not do something like this. Moreover, everything is fair in love and war. Yes, buddy. Hmm? Hmm. Hmm? Hmm. Yeah! Buddy! I guess she's coming to express her love. Hey! I'm not a magician to handle all the musicians. There is a limit for everything, guys. Excuse me. Hey! Don't disturb. Oh! Nandini. Is that you? What a surprise! Come… I want to talk to Tej personally. Can you all please go out? Oh! Sure. Why not? Let's go, guys. Come. All the best, buddy. All the best. I've been trying to meet you since morning. It is true that we were in love? That is… We… Say it. Did I love you? Did I wear a ring on you? Yeah! We loved each other. What is this, then? There's a misunderstanding. He is not my boyfriend. He is my assistant. I got to know the truth about you. You forgot your phone when you came to drop me. You've cheated me. You and your friends deceived me. Following you and taking an advantage of you… Singing in your troupe… Falling in love with you… Everything is a lie. Aren't you ashamed? How can you deceive someone like that to make them love you? I might consider everything to be true and love you. But, what will you gain with that kind of love? No. I… Damn! Nandu! Listen to me once. Don't tell me anything. Goodbye. It was my mistake, buddy. It might be anyone's mistake but is still a mistake. You are sad, buddy. I am sad. But, my love is incomplete. Buddy! Give me your phone. Why, buddy? She doesn't have your number, right? No. Okay. But… 'Nandini! Come to Meherbaba Ashram immediately.' 'Gangadhar.' Who is it in the picture, mom? He is orphan school's principal Mr. Gangadhar. I studied in their school during my childhood. Driver. Do you know where Meherbaba Ashram is? Take me there. Buddy! What kind of message was that? I dropped Nandu at the ashram when she was with me. 'There must be a connection. She came to India and went there twice.' That is why I sent her this message. We might find a clue over there. What is it, buddy? A lot has happened. Is it really required now? Why should we care about where she goes? Leave it, buddy. Hey! Nandu doesn't love me. Should I let her go just because of that reason? Her father is her enemy. Who will help her, then? Let's go. Yeah. I am astonished. Did all of it just in a week? Sir. Why did I come to India? Why did I come to meet you? I will tell you, dear. ( Your mom called me one day before her death. She asked me to help you when you come here. She asked me to find that guy and give these documents. After that, I got to hear about her death. I felt very sad. You came to me after that. We went to the Boston school in Vizag to find the address of that guy. Madam! The document that you're talking about… It got burnt in a fire accident. But, we can do something. There's a PT teacher named Murthy. He was very close to the kids. You can get some information if you meet him. Where will I find him? Murthy sir is a famous coach now. He's the coach for the international cricket league who sponsors. His office is in Hyderabad. Go there and inquire. You went to their office and did the inquiry after that. You came to me and said that Mr. Murthy is coming to Vizag on 20th of this month. After that, you came here to meet me again. That means… I came to India to fulfill my mom's last wish. Yes, dear. Dad is very selfish. He hid everything from me for the sake of money. Forget whatever has happened. By the God's grace, you found out everything. Now, you have to think about fulfilling your mom's wish. Yes, sir. You said that coach Murthy will come to Vizag in 20 days. 15 days are gone already. You can meet Mr. Murthy if you wait for 5 more days. You can find something about that guy. Yeah. Come. Hey. Wait. Here. Take the documents. I'll leave, sir. Okay, dear. Let's go… Nandini! If you father finds out that you came here… Then, he will take you back to London. It won't happen that way, sir. I will manage my dad these 5 days. I will go to Vizag without going to London. What is this? Why does she want to go to Vizag now? Why is she planning to go to Vizag to stay away from her dad? Nandini's dad is here. Ah? What ah? Nandini's dad is here. 'Dad is at music band office.' Sir! What are you doing here? Where is my daughter? That is…Actually! She should either be with me or come here for the rehearsal. Where is she? She is not picking my call. You've got us sign the documents. If something happens to her… Don't you feel responsible? He whistled but hasn't she come? She will come. Dad! When did you come here? What is it, dear? Where were you? Do you know? I was so tensed. Tej! Haven't you told my dad? We went for the practice, right? Yeah…That's right. Dad! Tej is a very good composer. He'll become like A.R. Rahman one day. Do you know? He planned the music programme very well. We have to go to Vizag immediately. Oh! Vizag? Why should you go to Vizag? You have to practice here, right? The plan has changed, dad. Isn't it, Tej? Yeah…Indeed! Yeah. She shouted at you earlier. She is talking sweetly now. What's the matter? She should go to Vizag secretly without letting her dad know. That is why she made up a story now. O' God! See what I will do. Sir! Our programme is cancelled. You can take back your daughter to London. Hey! Hey! Be silent. Let me talk. Madam. Go. Why are you still sitting? What happened? He has no mood. He failed in love. His heart is broken. He will not do the programme. Sir! You may go if you want to. Is it good? Let's go, dear. We shall go away from here. One minute, dad. What happened, Tej? Did you break-up? Why haven't you told me? Tell me who that girl is. I will talk to her and convince her. That won't happen. She is very stubborn. She is very selfish. She can do anything to gain what she wants. She is a liar. You cannot convince her. 'What is it? He is talking too much.' 'It is a lie if it is us and is charity if you do it?' Can you tell a lie? What are you saying? Meherbaba Ashram! Did you hear? Yeah. We know everything and the reason why you're going to Vizag. Please. I will give money whatever you ask. Take me there. Please. Please? Money? Will you give money? Do you think we are that cheap? Sir! Your daughter is going to Vizag. Please…Please. Sorry. I said that in haste. Please take me there. Please. What happened, dear? What's that discussion going on there? Is your Vizag programme on or off? Dad is coming. Please. Will you take me? I'm losing it. Say yes. Okay, sir. The programme is confirmed. We will take your daughter to Vizag. Tej will pick her. Get her ready. Dad! Come to Vizag on 20th. We shall go back to London that day. Hello. This isn't a Taxi for you to sit at the back. Come and sit in the front seat. So, Nandu! Did you eat something? Hello! Don't talk rubbish. There is no relation between is. It is just the agreement. After reaching Vizag… Our ways will get departed. Do you get it? Yeah. Let's go. I understood. (RADIO PLAYING) Are you crazy? What did you say? Our ways will get departed after reaching Vizag? This is just a sample. I will give you a heart attack before reaching Vizag. I will kill you. Sorry. Fill the tank. Yes, sister. Listen, Tej! Mom's health is getting worse. What? Come fast from wherever you are. You'll come, right? Yeah! I am coming. Hey. Hey! O' Man! Where are you going? I have an important work. Wait for half an hour. I will come back. I will go with you. Where will you come? I will come. What's that immediate work for you to go leaving me all alone here? I am hungry. I am going to eat something. What should I do all alone here? This Goddess is very powerful. Pray for whatever you want. I will come back in a while. Hey, Goddess! I cannot bear this torture. So, please send me away from me as soon as possible. Please. 'I have no idea where he's going.' He is going inside like a thief. Will he go to anyone's house if he is hungry? Sister… Tej! Happy birthday, Tej. Is that why you said that aunt's health is ill? Yeah. You won't come if I do not say it. That is why I said that. You! Crazy. What if uncle finds out? Nothing will happen. I am leaving. Hey, Tej. Listen to me. No. I am leaving. Listen. Wait. Listen to me. Hey, Tej. (RINGING DOORBELL) Who is it? There is a thief in your house. Did he come? I knew it. It is his birthday. Who is it, sister-in-law? The thief is here. Superb! Did you come along with him? Are they crazy? Who is it, sister? This girl? This is the girl that I told you about. I told you that day. She is the one. Oh! Come in, Nandini. How do they know my name? Mummy! Brother! Ssh…Uncle might get up. Yes. Mom's sister! Mom's younger sister! She is my aunt. And she is my sister. Hi. It is our wedding next month. Naughty girl! She is my sister as well. (GIGGLES) Lakshmi! What's that noise? What to do now? Won't you let me sleep in peace? What's happening there? Did you forget? Today is Tej's birthday. Why are you worried about his birthday when he is not here? Go and sleep. Who is that, aunty? Why is he shouting like that? Who is this girl? Uncle! She is my friend. She came here for the summer holidays. Oh! Okay. Go and sleep now. Yeah. Let's go, dear. Hey. Wait… What is it? Why did you tell him that I'm your friend? We'll be dead if you say that you are a friend of Tej. Why? It was my sister's wedding last year. Tej bro went away that day and came back now. This is Tej's flashback. Yashu! I am coming, mom. 'Oh! So, this is Tej's flashback.' 'There are four more days for the coach to come to Vizag.' 'Tej will leave me and go if I go away from here.' 'So, it is safe for me to stay here for 4 days.' 'I have to do something and stay here.' You made up a story and brought me here to do this, right? Shut up and eat. You'd be good if you hadn't lied. ♪ Happy birthday to you… ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Happy birthday, dear. ♪ Happy birthday dear Tej ♪ ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ Enough… Eat… (COUGHS) Hey! Come here. Come. Hold this. Mom! She is crazy. Wait for 5 minutes. I am coming. My leg hurts. Let's go after 2 days. Hey! Do you think that this is a resort? Not 2 days. I will come in 2 minutes and we shall leave. What? Will you leave now? Mom! It will be a problem if uncle finds out. So, will you go even if I am really sick? Shut up. How long will you stay away like this, dear? He would stay with you if he really loves you, aunty. Hey! Did she ask you? Hey. Stay back, brother. Stay back. Stop it. Why are making it noisy? Crazy boys! Music troupe. Listen! Our neighbors turned on their lights. There might be a problem if someone sees you. Uncle! I am leaving. Hey! Go in the morning. Go and sleep now. All of you! Go to sleep. Hey. Get ready fast. We have to go. We have to leave before uncle gets up. The bathroom isn't here. It is upstairs. Go. 'I have to do something and plan to stay here.' 'But, how?' 'Yes! How can he go if he doesn't find the car keys?' 'Oh, no! He came.' 'Shit…' 'Oh, no! The door is locked.' 'What should I do now?' 'He is coming.' Everyone is coming. You say so but you will not come. Uncle! Get out. Uncle is coming. That's not my problem. Then, the Vizag programme will be cancelled. No! No. No. No. My purse is in the cupboard. Get it. Hmm. Hello. Listen, carpenter. My room's door has an issue. Come and check it once. Relatives are coming. Okay? What happened, dear? How did you come here? Oh! Tej will you take you away. That is why you are hiding here, right? No problem. I will convince him. Are you also here? Hey! Are you talking to the cupboard? Nothing. I am unable to find it. You go. I will search for it and get it. Okay. I will wait downstairs. Hey! Come out. Aunt… How can you do it? Aunt. Shut up. You should do everything after marriage. Okay, aunt. Hey! What's happening? I will say that after the wedding. Give me your hand. It is not needed. Uncle. It is hot. That's your friend, right? Why is she climbing the wall? I will go and see, uncle. Nandini. Yeah. What are you doing here? Hey! Come fast. Hey! Uncle saw you. You go. She will come later. Yeah. Okay… Send her to the temple. Okay… Nothing, uncle. She got scared to see you. Scared of me? Why, dear? Mr. Vishwanath! Yeah. I am coming. I parked the car here. Where is it? How did it reach there? Hey, you! Your uncle abandoned you from the house that day. That is why we remained silent. You come back here and roam around happily. How long have you been doing this? Nothing like that, Ajay. Hey! Call his uncle. Ajay! Listen to me. Let it be. I am going. Don't call my uncle. I will do whatever you ask me to. Please. What will you do? Tej. Nandini. Go away from here. Tej! Hey. I don't have any connection with that girl. Please. Don't harm her. I can understand your relation with her by the way your emotion comes out. Anyway! I loved your sister since my childhood. You took her away and got her married to someone else. You didn't care about my feelings. Ajay! I plead you do not harm her. Hey! Bring her here. Hey! No! Let him go. Please… Please leave him. Nandini! You go away from here. We let him go that day because we gave respect to your words. But, see what has happened. Today, he came to your house without obeying your words. Also, he hit my son. What will you do now? Uncle isn't responsible for what has happened. He doesn't know that I came home. Don't punish him for my mistake. Stop it. Why does he try to kill me while I am still alive? Anyway! Why am I talking to you about it? In fact, all of you together deceived me. Listen! It is my mistake. Tell me. Whose feet should I hold? There is no need for you to hold anyone's feet, uncle. I am sorry. Dad. Stop right there. You dishonest person! Why did you come here again? Both of you are the reason for this fight. I will… Listen! You can say anything to me. But, don't say anything to brother. Damn! Shut your mouth. Swetha! Sorry, brother. Don't stop me. Uncle! Do you know what actually happened that night? I fell in love with a guy named Aditya. That day, all of you fell asleep. 'I went away with Aditya who was waiting for me, uncle.' Go fast. Please go fast. Hey! That's your brother. Brother. Brother. Sir…Please. How dare you to run away with my sister! Listen! I asked him to come, brother. Hey! Shut up. How can you make such decision? Are you that old enough? Huh? I love him more than my life, brother. You should say that earlier if that is the case. They will not agree. So? Will you dare to do this? Haven't you thought about mom, dad, uncle and aunt? They will die. What should we say to Ajay who loved you since childhood? How can you be so selfish? Swetha! Let us go away from here. Hey! Where will you go? Brother…Stop. How can you leave after seeing me? I love her. Brother…Stop it. Will you take her away? Huh? You should convince her family if you really love her. How you run away with her. I love her. Try to understand. Swetha. Swetha! Stop. Swetha! Stop. Swetha! What are you doing? Swetha. What are you doing? How will uncle feel if he knows about it? What happened? What's the matter? What happened that made you do so? Tell me at least now, Swetha. I am pregnant, brother. (CHANTING MARITAL RITES) Hey. Get up. Be happy always. 'I was the one who did a mistake.' But, Tej bro put him at fault to hide my mistake, uncle. A lot has happened today. But, he will not say that it is my mistake. That is how my brother is. Why didn't you tell me about it? Not an issue, aunt. What is all this? Uncle. What happened? Listen. What happened to you? Sorry, dear. What for? Forget it, uncle. Dad. Brother! Forgive me, brother. Hey!

Come, dear. We are waiting for you. What happened, uncle? Hey! You came here to find the guy who saved your mother, right? Yes, uncle. How do you know? I just came to know that. Mr. Murthy! Nandini is here. I heard that Mr. Murthy came early from UK. So, I went and met him in Vizag. Dear! I got to know that this is the house of that boy. Later, I got to know that you are here. I know everything, dear. The one who saved your mom and went to the prison is none other than… Tej! What are you saying, sir? Yes, dear. My son saved your mom. Tej. My mom said about you… Mr. Gangadhar told you everything, right? Your mom thought about me before she died. Your mom is very great, Nandini. I hurt you a lot knowingly or unknowingly. I am sorry. Tej! Come with me. What happened, uncle? Just come. Hey. Tej! Did Nandini come? Oh! Hey…Sssh… Why did you bring him alone? Why didn't you ask him? Yeah. I should've asked. Uncle! What is happening? Nothing, dear. Everyone told me. That you are in love with that girl. I will talk to Nandini. Okay? No, uncle. What happened? Why do you refuse? It is true that I love Nandu. But, that is my bad luck. She met with an accident before knowing her feeling. She forgot everything. But, I still tried to gain her love. In that process, I turned out to be a fraud. It is not right to force her to love me. No, uncle. Let it be. Listen, Tej. Everything is good. Why are you talking like that? Yeah. Nandini will accept you if you ask her now. Yeah! She might agree. She might get ready to risk her life for me. But, that won't be love. It would be more like a favor, uncle. Let it be. It is not like that, dear. You used to say this during my childhood. We should expect them to be happy when we help someone. But, never expect a favor. You might tell her about my love and she might agree. It would be selfishness. Love should come out from heart. It shouldn't be the reaction of helping someone. 'I fell in love with you before knowing this.' Brother! What are you saying? What if she fell in love before knowing this? It is not like that. She prayed when we came here. That we should depart. It is better to do that. Please, brother. Please give it a try… Please. I will not accept even if Nandu says so. Tej. Tej. Good that everyone is here. Tej! I have a flight this evening. Dad would wait for me at the airport. I will leave. Greetings, aunty. Wait for a minute, dear. He will drop you to the airport. Go. You've got flight in the evening. Wait for a while. Have food and then you can leave. Come. Let's go, dear. Tej! Think about it just once. Listen to me. Tej! Let's go. Bye. Bye. Bye. Come, dear. Did your programme go well? Hmm. Take this, dad. What is this, dear? You came to India for this, right? Tej who came with me is the one who saved mom. But, he denied taking the property. (FLIGHT ANNOUNCEMENT) Hi, Nandini. Did you propose Tej? No, sir. But, who are you? What is this? You came to my college to meet him. Did you forget? Yes, sir. I forgot everything. The reason for coming here… Everything that happened after that… I forgot everything. Oh! Is it? Don't worry, dear. I will tell you what happened that day. You came to propose Tej while he was writing his exam. You asked me to give a letter to Tej. I thought that it was a chit and tore it. You became sad and left. Who are you? Dad! Just one minute. The final boarding announcement is made. We have to go. Sorry, sir. My luck is bad. Tej will not accept even if I say it now. Thank you so much, sir. Wait, dear. You came back again that day. Yes. You came back again that day. Sir. What is it now? Sir! Will you give this pen to Tej? But, he brought a pen. This isn't a pen to write. Then, what? One minute. Hey! Write your exam later. Come out first. I love you. Love you. Give this to Tej. He will understand. Tej. Who is Tej? Tej. Tej! Who is Tej? Tej? Tej wasn't in the class. You left. I tried to find either of you to give this pen. Take it. This is your pen. Thank you, sir. Nandini dear. Sir. Wait… Tej! This pen? Professor gave it to me. You were writing your exam and I came there. Did you come? Hmm. Hey. Write your exam later. Come out first. I love you. Love you. Love you. I loved you back then, Tej. I didn't have anything other than this to say that to you. I love you. I love you, Tej. SUBTITLES BY TITLES MEDIA Colored by novabros
