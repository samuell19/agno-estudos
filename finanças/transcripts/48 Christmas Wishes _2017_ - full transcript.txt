- These are the three finalists for this year's official Christmas cookie, Santa. This is fabulous! Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho! Oh, Patty. Can you please run this down to mail room 42? You got it Santa. Now, where was I? Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho! Hey guys! Sorry I'm late. Hi Mom. You made it. Are you kidding? I would not miss this for the world. Oh, Blake, honey, it looks incredible in here. Thanks Mom. Emma even helped. - No I didn't. - Really? Well maybe she's saving all her energy for the big stocking hanging ceremony. This is already way too much. You guys have gone crazy. Crazy good? Nope. Mom, I put up Dad's picture if that's okay? Of course honey. That's a great spot for it. That was a really magical Christmas, wasn't it Em? - Honey, where are you going? - Upstairs. Hey, we're just getting started. I brought home some marshmallows. So what do you say we put on some music and we put the hot cocoa on the stove? Christmas isn't magical. It's just cheap plastic decorations. Look, because your father loved Christmas, okay, it's important that we keep these traditions going to keep his memory alive. Well, it's not working. Emma. We do this every year. We put up these decorations and pretend like everything is okay, like Dad's still here. But he's not. And putting up some stupid decorations isn't going to bring him back. Hey, I love decorating. It's because you don't remember. Hey, hey, that's enough. Look I am trying very... Emma Mary, get back here right now. Mom? Can I write my letter to Santa now? Of course you can honey. That's a great idea. - Emma's starting to forget. And Blake, he never even had the chance. I just wish the kids could have known you better. I wish we had a little more time. Will it ever be magical again? - I love the smell of wishes in the morning. Mindy, you're holding us up. We've already catalogued that request. Do we really need to check it twice? These aren't requests, they're wishes. Each one of these letters comes from a human. Do you realize that? This is a human and this is a human, and this is a human. Humans and their wishes are of the greatest importance to us Elves. It's their happiness in our hands. You're stepping on that human's happiness. Thomas in Carlton wants a toy fire truck. Fire truck for Thomas in Carlton. Check. I can make amazing toy fire trucks. I should have been placed in... In the Builders' Workshop. - We know. - We know. Well both of my... Both of your parents are toy builders. And I got... The best grades in this year's toy building exams. We get it. You don't like the Mailroom. I know you'd rather be building right now, But it's just as important that we open these letters and get these wishes right. All of these humans are depending on us. I guess you're right. Looks like Brandon Little wants a turtleneck. Okay. It's not that I don't like the Mailroom. It's, it's, it's just that... It's that you hate it. Sorry Sammy. I know you love the Mailroom. It's the best place ever. A special letter. We don't see many of those these days. What is it? I though you didn't care for the mail. Of course I care for the mail. If we didn't have mail then us builders wouldn't know what to build. It's a letter to Santa from an adult. An adult? What's so special about that? Don't they send letters every year? Nope. Humans stop writing letters to Santa once they hit their teen years. Why? Don't know. Humans can be funny in that way, I guess. That's so silly. Why wouldn't you want gifts? I know a lot about humans and yes they can be pretty silly. I've heard that only some of them have dogs as pets. If you were a human, wouldn't you have like a hundred dogs? Totally. Wouldn't you want a hundred dogs Mindy? What? What do we have next Sammy? Ah, letters to Santa from... Minnedoza. Hi everybody, just checking in. We're getting through the mail in record time. Hi George. Why was I assigned to the Mailroom? I'm not sure. Santa's got a lot on his mind right now. Pre-Christmas jitters perhaps. You can apply for Builder again next year. Next year? I have to sort letters for a whole... Tomorrow is Christmas Eve, Mindy. So there's lots to be done. So for now, you all must get to work in your placements. With pleasure. Hey, who likes impressions? Check this out. Ho Ho Ho. You're Santa Claus. Check it out, Mindy. He's Santa Claus. Hey Sammy, heads up. Delivery for Miss Mindy. Come on Mindy, it's your turn. Noooooo! Merry day-of-the-eve before Christmas Eve, George. Uh. Yes, same to you. Please remember that Vixen's carrots should be steamed not boiled, and Comet's carrot cake should be gluten free. Way ahead of you, sir. Thank you, Richard. Good morning Benny. Seems like Christmas is getting close to Full Cheer. George, just the man I've been waiting for. Now you hold on just a second. Here we are. It's the recipe to Santa's Secret Christmas cake. How did you know I was going to ask you for that? Ah yes, you're the Elf with all the answers. This is a picture of a dog wearing sunglasses. I do misplace the answers sometimes. No need to rush, Benny. I'll swing by later to pick up that recipe. Did you maybe want the recipe to twice cooked chestnuts instead? So what do you say we all go for a little drive after this? I have a few wreaths to deliver, but then I thought maybe the three of us could go skating after at City Hall. Yeah, sure. Pass... Or we could watch a movie together. Em, are you feeling okay? I thought painting was your favorite. May I be excused? I have homework. Well, actually, no. Not yet. I have a little something to give you both. It's a present. It arrived today, but it's not for Christmas. It's just a little something that your Dad and I thought you would both really like. Can we get it now? Yes, you can get it now. But first I need both of you to close your eyes. I'm not closing my eyes. Just for a second, close 'em. Can we open them? Okay, open up. It's so cute. Is that for real? Yes it's for real. Can we keep him? Of course, he's part of the family now. Em, what do you think we should we name him? This is so lame. You can't replace Dad with a dog. Don't worry, Mom. I'll still take care of him forever and be his best friend. Great honey, well... I have to get going before it's too late, okay? Well, can the dog and I come? We could show him around town. I'm sure he'd love to see the Christmas lights. I think that's a great idea. Go get your boots on. Sir, are you working on the Heknows machine again? Not to worry. I'm just trying to make some improvements to this old thing. Could you please hand me the hammer? This old thing has been showing us who's been naughty or nice for the past few hundred years. With all due respect, if it ain't broke, don't tinker with it. Christmas as we know it is changing. We must adapt, dear George. Don't you see it? We're getting more letters, giving more toys. It's busy, but I guarantee with the help of the Junior Elf Interns this afternoon, all orders will be fulfilled and ready to fly by tomorrow night. Wishes. They are someone's wishes, not orders. Oh yes yes, of course. As long as our Wishers get what they want. Yes, but are they getting what they actually need? Happiness levels are way down. Getting what you want doesn't make you happy if you don't have what you need. Toys aren't the only answer. If only there were a way for us to really know what humans need. Mighty mistletoe. What do we do? We are in so much trouble. So much. Okay guys, we are three smart Elves, we can figure this out. Has this ever happened before? Never. Maybe we should just tell Santa. He'll know what to do, right? Yeah, we should tell Santa. No, wait. We need to try to figure this out by ourselves. Mindy, I know you're a great builder and all, but there are even things you can't fix. Just let me think. We should tell someone. Maybe George, he's Santa's right hand Elf. I got it. Coast is clear. Guys. Focus. Um, excuse me. Benny? Wha... Yes? You have a... Oh, yes. I know. Christmas cake. Benny. I need to talk to you. Right. I've been expecting you. You have? I know what you want to ask me. You do? You want to know why Santa put you in the Mailroom rather than the Builders' Workshop. Well, obviously Santa made a mistake. A mistake, you say? Santa's Mistake Book! Just as I thought. It's empty. But? Mistakes don't happen at the North Pole. I don't know why we even have the book. How'd you know she was put in the Mailroom? Wait. Are you the Elf with all the answers? Yes. Who are you? Classic. Can I ask you a question? Those who ask the right questions will find the right answers. Do you know where the puppies are at? I really wanted to meet one. Cam, not now. Mindy? George. Christmas cake. Thank you Benny. Mindy, what are you three doing here? Everything alright in the Mailroom? Of course everything's alright in the Mailroom. Why do you ask? Because you're here, and not there. We're just taking a break, and hanging out with our old friend, Remmy. Benny. Benny. Maybe I should just take a quick peek. Nooo! Ah, everything's alright in there, promise. We were just stretching our legs. Very well then. Carry on. Still lots of work for us to do. We Elves don't rest until this Wish-O-Meter is at 100 percent. That's strange. The Wish-O-Meter seems to have moved backwards. Moved backwards? Odd. That can't be. George did you forget your glasses again? You're probably right Mindy. Very well then, carry on. Oh, and Mindy. About the Mailroom. I know you wanted to be placed in the Builders' Workshop, but I think you will excel in mail. We're Time Elves and there's no time. Santa has to leave early now and were still not at full cheer. No time. Not a full cheer? Christmas is ruined. We should have been Mail Elves. I think I'm gonna have an Elf attack. Andy, do your Elf dance. That always calms you down. Okay. I'm an Elf and this is my Elf dance. That's what I'm talking about. Will you two stop dancing? We don't have time for dancing. As I was saying, mistakes don't happen at the North Pole. Yeah, but what if they did? But, we are just curious. Because we have all of those letters in that Mailroom, every last one. And everything is going great. Let me see. Okay. Here we go. "If wishes are not heard, they cannot be fulfilled." "Those humans whose wishes are unfulfilled would stop believing..." Ah, here's the good stuff. "If humans stop believing in the magic of Christmas it will inevitably lead to the end of Christmas itself." Oh, boy. Good thing that's not happening. Cookie? I can't believe that just happened. Christmas is not ruined yet. Not even close. This is bad. So bad. Don't worry, we can fix this. Did you see the Wish-O-Meter? It went backwards. Backwards. And when those letters landed in the fireplace They must've vanished. Vanished. And if we can't find all of them, It could be the end of Christmas altogether. Lose Christmas. I know. Let's try to calm down. Calm down? We just lost an entire town's wishes. No, no need to do that. We need to think of the positive here. We've just misplaced a few letters. We were expecting 48 letters. That's 48 wishes gone. But compared to a few million others that we didn't lose, that's not so bad, right? Right. Not right. Those poor people from Minnedoza. We'll never find out what their wishes were. Wait. Sammy, that name, Minnedoza. That's where the wishes came from, right? Right. And all of Minnedoza's Christmas letters came from that tube. Yeah. And we don't necessarily need their letters, we just need their wishes. Wait. I think I know what you're thinking and I don't think I like it. What is she thinking? We need to get the wishes straight from the source. The humans? Exactly. We just go to Minnedoza, we ask the humans what they want for Christmas, and then we report them back here. Problem solved. Problem solved. Are you kidding me? Oh, Elves can't just leave the North Pole without permission. And they certainly can't interact with humans. That's gotta be breaking at least five Elf codes. It's better than doing nothing and causing the end of Christmas. Is anyone else starting to see sugar plums dancing around their heads? Maybe it's best if you stay here. You can keep things running smoothly in the Mailroom. We'll pretend to be humans. Yes, but you have to blend in. If anyone finds out you're Elves and you've lost the town's wishes, it could cause Christmas chaos. Hey you're talking to the Human Expert here. I bet I can find some stuff like this in the Clothing Createatorium. This may actually work. You totally look like humans. Minn-e-doza, here we come. Let's roll. Just let me build this first. Jingle walkie-talkies. Okay so all I need to do is reverse the direction of the delivery mechanism. There. Oh, and one more thing. Here, Sammy. Jingle walkie-talkies. We can use them to relay the wishes back to you, So you can give them to the Builders. Testing, testing, one, two, three. Did you hear that? Yes. Cool. They work. This is going to be a long trip. Looks like we made it. Mighty mistletoe. Look at all those humans. Ow, you're stepping on my foot. What's your foot doing under my foot? What do we say? What should we say? Oh, hi little girl. Give us your wishes. A hug. I've read about those in human-studies. A hug is one of human's most treasured greetings. Huh, that's interesting. I hope that we get some hugs. We gotta get out there, Sammy. We can't just sit in here and wait for humans to come to us. Rolling snowballs! It's a dog, it's a real dog. Okay, enough. Focus. End of Christmas, remember? Right. But that kid, with the dog. That's our first wish. Excuse us, normal human beings coming through. Why is everybody looking at us? I don't know. Let me check my human textbook. Awkward book pose. I saw something about this on the news. Some new trend... time travel challenge? Sorry. Hello? A greeting. That was a success. This is ridiculous. That textbook of yours must be out of date. Girl, that's whack. Stick to the plan. Let's get this kid's wish. Do you like the snow? I love the snow. Uh, hello fellow tiny human. How'd you do that? Do what? That was awesome. You've never seen a handshake before? No, you moved in super speed. Super speed? I don't think so. That's impossible. Hello. Is that a dog? I always wanted to meet a dog. Who are you guys? Why are you dressed like Elves? We're not dressed like Elves. We're dressed like human kids. Okay, no human kid talks like that. Or moves that fast. I don't know what you think you saw, But we're going to need you to forget that you saw what you think you saw. No I can't. I saw that. North Pole to Mindy. North Pole to Mindy. Did you make it? Please let me know. North Pole? What, are you actual Elves? What are you doing here? We can't tell you. If anyone found out that we've lost the whole town's Christmas wishes, - there could be Christmas chaos. - Cam, shhh! No way. You lost all our wishes? Well we didn't necessarily lose them, we just don't know where they are. So you need to go around town and get everybody's wishes? Ha. That's so cool. Well, it's not exactly an ideal situation for us. So, if you could just tell us your Christmas wish, We'll be on our way. Let me help you. Oh no. I can help you. It's a pretty small town and I know everyone in it. At least the kids anyhow. We could probably use the help. And he probably knows a lot about humans cuz, well... I'm Blake Williams, and I asked Santa for a new bike. There. That's one wish off your list. Sammy, we've got our first wish. - And we've got some human help. - Yes. I'll go tell my Mom that I'm going to walk the dog home. And, we need to get you some new clothes. C'mon. Sammy. Working up a sweat, processing those letters I see. Oh, yes sir. Where are the others? Others? The other... letters are right here. These last bags of wishes that we have here in the Mailroom at this present moment. I meant Mindy and Cam. Where are they? Mindy and Cam? Where are they? They... are... where? Is it hot in here? Yes, I suppose it is a little stuffy. It is hot in here. So, therefore, Mindy and Cam they just slid out, stepped out, to get some air to breathe that is cold. Okay. Very well. Breaks are certainly permitted. You look like you could use one yourself, Sammy. Just be sure that the three of you Work at a good pace when they return. You know we will. Realy? Well, my mom and I decorated this whole place. We went kind of Christmas crazy this year. C'mon. This is a Christmas tree. Did your sister help you decorate it? Nah. She's a bit of a Scrooge. What's a Scrooge? It's someone who doesn't like Christmas. There are humans who don't like Christmas? You must like Christmas, right? Are you kidding? I love Christmas. That's what Christmas looks like. And check this out. Smell that? That's what Christmas smells like. Christmas smells like those candles we make back in the North Pole. Follow me. Is that a Christmas tree? Hello? Christmas tree. That one isn't decorated because it's for the winter fair tomorrow. My Mom and I decorate the whole Community Centre with all this stuff. You decorate with socks? Father Christmas. Look at this tool box. What does this have in here? That was my Dad's. We don't really use it anymore. My Mom doesn't want to go through his stuff anymore cuz he passed away. Passed away? Oh, ah. He died. Six years ago. That's so sad. Yeah. I don't really remember him because I was pretty young but I still miss him. He was a great Dad. At least, that's what people always tell me. Here, you'd like this. What have you done to Santa? No, it's not the real Santa suit. Humans have this tradition at Christmas where they sometimes dress up as Santa. That's pretty weird. My Dad used to wear this suit every Christmas Eve At the Winter Wonderland and perform "The Night Before Christmas" for the whole town. See? "The Night Before Christmas". That's his handwriting. Cool. I don't remember him ever performing it, but it must have been pretty special. Oh no, we weren't supposed to be in here. My Mom's home. Ah, clean. We're on it. Ah, that way. Blake? Hi Mom. That was close. You guys okay? We can organize this for you if you like. It'll take seven seconds. No, that's okay. Here. Just take these. It will help you blend in. Are you sure? Well, let's go collect some wishes. We can't go out now, it's getting late. Kids will be going to bed soon. Then we'll sneak into their rooms and wake them up. That's not a very good idea. You guys don't know much about humans, do you? Come to school with me tomorrow and we can get all the wishes at once. But tomorrow night is Christmas Eve. That's not going to leave us much time. I've seen how fast you guys move. We'll be fine. Mom! Time to go. Moo Cow. Look what I found, Mindy. Moo Cow. You know Moo Cow? Of course, we make them in the North Pole. Wanna play? I already know all of the cards off by heart. I'll win too quickly. It's not about winning. It's about being silly and having fun. I don't get it. It's all about making the other person laugh. So, I pick a card. Here we go. Are you okay? I'll give you another clue. You're a monkey. That's it. And I get two points and the next person goes. I wanna go next. Um... A fish? Benny? An angry fish? A Santa Claus? I'm an elephant, guys. That's the craziest Elephant I've ever seen. Blake, what's going on in there? That's my sister. Hide! What? Open the door. No, just duck down. No, I don't mean be a duck, just... Never mind. Hey, Em. What's up? What's going on in there? I'm not leaving until you tell me. We were just playing Moo Cow, I was... I was just playing Moo Cow. You can't play that game by yourself. You totally can. I heard people laughing. I was laughing at myself. I did something hilarious. You wanna see the face I discovered in the mirror? A cramp. I'm getting a cramp. I can't be a duck back here any more. There's too much clutter. You're so weird. Okay, what's going on? That was just the dog. Oh hey, how'd you get out here? No way. Now I definitely know something's going on. Do you have a girl in here? No, why would I have a girl in here? Thanks for stopping by... Tell me the truth or I'll tell Mom. Fine. I have two Elves in here from the North Pole And they lost all the letters from Minnedoza and now they need my help. - Oh, come on. - That's the truth. Grow up. Hey, what in the world is going on in here? Blake you cleaned? He's been acting so weird. So what, is a person not allowed to laugh and have fun? Remember when you used to do that? Okay, okay that's enough. It's dinner time. I like this game. Okay. So you're my friends visiting from up North for Christmas. Got it? I'm nervous. It's okay, you'll be fine. Just try to act natural. No hugging. Right. Humans need so many Christmas hugs that I won't be able to do it alone. We'll have to form a team of huggers. Just say hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Stop hugging everyone. But he had his earmuffs on, he couldn't hear my Hi. Cam focus. We need to get these wishes. Okay, hands in, on three... One, two three... - Wishes! - Candy Canes! That's a pretty cool microscope. Yeah, it's alright I guess. You probably want one for yourself right? No, not really. Maybe you asked Santa for one? I don't really like science that much. Bunsen burner? No. Beakers? No. A funnel? No. A petri dish? Not really. A periodic table poster? No. Test tubes? I really just want a new guitar. Ahhh, that was my next guess. And last year I asked for a goldfish, Which seemed like a pretty good idea at the time. - Yes but... - But it was nowhere near as bad as the train set incident of 2012. So you can probably understand why I have some hesitation to... Oh, Dasher! I've got to go. But I'd really love to quickly hear Exactly what you asked Santa for before I go... Well I... Hey! Oops! Sorry. I was just so wrapped up in writing my last minute letter to Santa. Do you want in on this? I can jot your wish down on here with mine if you like. Well, I already wrote my letter to Santa. Well, it can't hurt to tell him twice. Well I guess so. Okay. And that's why we should be giving reindeer leafy greens instead of carrots. Any questions? Where'd you get this bogus information? What do you want for Christmas? My stomach! It aches! I think I ate too many of those pizza pies. That looks like it hurts. Yeah. And can you believe it? I just asked for a new hockey stick for Christmas. That's great. I mean... bummer. Yeah, thanks man. Umm, excuse me. Hello. Why, why aren't you looking at me? I'm talking to you. What device is that? Um... Okay... hello. It's fine I got this. Anyone who tells me what they want for Christmas will get a candy cane! And... send. What? That's five easy wishes. I hope you have a lot of candy canes. Oh boy. I already told you I didn't ask Santa for any stupid presents. Now could you please get your weird friends to stop following me around? It's mortifying. What? Who's following you? Is that my sweater? Do you think she's on to us? No way. Hey Sammy, yeah it's me. So Clara, she wants a doll. And Jim, he wants a train set. Over. Can you believe it? We have almost all of our wishes. Don't get too excited. We've still got a few to go. Hey! Wait! Tell me... Sugar plums! We haven't gotten his wish yet. Don't worry, he'll be at the Winter Wonderland tonight. The whole town will be. Can we come too? That's kinda what I was thinking. C'mon. Okay guys. I've done all I can do up here. You have nine left. Very well, then. Carry on. Everything alright in the Mailroom? Oh no! What am I going to do now? Father Christmas! Mindy? Yes? Mindy? Is that you? Yes, it's me. Hi George. Hey George. Hi. Hello everyone. May I come in? Oh, is it locked? We'd love to let you in, but we're just working so hard in here. Our hands are full. I'm just doing my rounds, you know, checking in. We're close to departure time. Everything is going great. Oh look. This person wants a hamster. I wish I was building a hamster. Will you two stop horsing around? It's Christmas Eve. And poor George has better things to do than to check in on us. Hey Sammy. We're headed to the Winter Wonderland to get the final few wishes. Over. You... You're going where now? Hey Mom. Sorry I'm late. Oh, not to worry. Hello. These are my new friends, Cam and Mindy. - Hi. - Hi Mom. They're really good at helping. I was wondering if they could help us set up? Many hands make light work. Why don't the three of you help me decorate the Christmas tree, okay? Oh... Look. This is one of my favorites. Your Dad gave this to me on one of our very first Christmases together. Wow, it's beautiful. What would you like for Christmas this year? All I want is for Christmas to feel like Christmas. So, how did the three of you meet? Uh... school? Yes, school. You are good helpers. Thank you. We know. It looks beautiful. But just remember, take your time, guys. One of the best things about Christmas decorations is putting them up. Okay I think we are all ready to go here. Great, I'm just going to do a quick sound check And then we'll open the doors. Okay, is everybody ready? It's almost time to open the doors. Ready. Blake, I think you should do the honours this year. Cue the lights! This is what Christmas feels like. Places people, places! Oh, here we go. Have fun guys. Thanks Mom! Okay, eight more wishes then we're done. Save Christmas, let's go. - That's what I asked Santa for too. - I totally get it. Moo Cow is the best game I've ever played. Mine's delicious. It is delicious. Careful, it's hot. Rolling snowballs, that is hot. Anyone for seconds? I could really use a new camera. Well, that's a great gift. Well, it was nice meeting you but I should be... Wait, I haven't even taken your picture yet. Mind just taking your hat off? Thanks. Perfect. Merry Christmas, Mindy. And we've got a new camera for Nicole. Katie and Sarah both want Moo Cow, Bret wants a puzzle, Chris wants new boots, Everyone's having a great time, have you tried the hot chocolate? It's really good, and Christmas is fun. Hey Sammy, did you hear all that? Snowstorm moving in. Listen. Santa's sleigh needs to depart much earlier So he can deliver the gifts Safely. I need to know... We need those last few wishes. Fast. Okay, new plan. What in the world are you two Elves doing out here? And why aren't you in full costume yet? - It's nearly show time. - We're not... No time for excuses. You are on in five. Now take off those sweaters and I'll put them with the others. And please be careful with those plastic ears. Daniel has somehow managed to go through two pairs already. We're not even part of the show. Try to follow along. Um, got him, got her, yes, yes, yes... Hi, I don't think we've met. I'm Mindy. Excuse me. I'm prancing here! I'm a snowflake. What would you like for Christmas? I can't tell you. Why not? Because I only tell Santa. Because I only tell Santa. Here comes Santa Claus. No, that's the next song. Oh, sorry. Keep on jingle bell-ing. C'mon. Blake, we need your Dad's Santa suit so you can dress up as Santa tonight. Humans can't resist telling Santa their wishes. But it's too big. Don't worry, I can fix it. And it's at home, in the basement. Not a problem. It's only a few blocks. I'll be back in a jiffy. Hey. You gonna eat that? Santa suit. Ah tool box, handy. Handy full of letters. Safety pins. Clothes pins. More stuffing. I'm gonna burst. Don't worry, you look very jolly. Just with a few Ho Ho Ho's, you'll be good to go. How are you holding up Laura? I know Christmas is always tough for you guys. We're doing okay. Thank you, thank you both. The kids are doing alright? I haven't seen Emma here anywhere. Oh no, she's here somewhere. Well you know she's thirteen so... I remember being thirteen. It must be so hard without John. Do want any more casseroles or anything? You know what? No, I don't. Thank you. It's been six years. And you're absolutely right, it's been really hard. And I miss John more than I ever thought possible. And Emma says she hates Christmas. But I think she's just really hurting inside because she misses him too, you know and, Blake, my little one, he loves Christmas, he loves everything about it just like his Dad. I question myself every single day, because I wonder how I'm going to give those kids a joyous, happy Christmas when I'm sad? You know, so, I cry most nights because I realize that these kids didn't just lose a father, they lost their Christmas too. Laura... So no, no, but not any more. Not for anymore Christmases to come. And you know why? You know why, because love prevails. Right? Love conquers all, and even though John is no longer with us, his love is still very much with us. It is. I feel it every single day, I do. So we are going to be fine, we're gonna be more than fine. And I hope you are too. So have a Merry Christmas Brent and Sandra. I guess she doesn't need any more casseroles. I think you put too much cheese on them. People don't like that much cheese. And that's what I want for Christmas. Okay, Merry Christmas. We did it! We did it! And it's Merry Christmas everyone! - Why are we jumping up and down? - We saved Christmas. Yeah, hey Sammy. We did it. Megan wants skates. Guys there's still one wish left. One left? That should be it. How? We got everybody in town. Sammy, could you help us track down whoever's wish that was? No. But I think I might know who might know. Mindy, I think I need to change. Mindy. Are you there? I shouldn't have been wearing this in the first place. I think I need to put it back. Guys, are you listening? Mhm, what was that? I need help with the suit. But it's just a costume. What's the rush? Sammy to Mindy. This is urgent. You guys will never be able to save Christmas. You still don't even understand it. Hey Blake. Was that anger? We gotta talk to him. There's still one more wish. You go get it. I'll talk to Blake. Mindy! What? You are not going to believe this. Two letters were sent from 326 Carroll Street. 326 Carroll Street? Blake's house. That can't be possible. Blake only asked for a new bike and his sister said she didn't send any letters this year. Mindy, you have to hurry. Santa is leaving any minute. Okay, I'll try my best. But you have to stall Santa. Buy us some time. Rolling snowballs. Emma, I need to talk to you for a quick sec. Emma, please. I'm sorry I lost your wish. I really am. Don't take it personally. I don't really care about any of those letters. But I was wrong. Holly jolly I was wrong. But I can still fix this. I want to make things right. Please, I just know the letter came from your house. I just need you to... I didn't write a letter to Santa this year. I haven't written one since my Dad died. Don't you get it? I don't have any wishes. But you must. Every human being has at least one wish. We take wishes very seriously up at the North Pole. Blake was telling the truth, wasn't he? You're a real Elf. Emma, please. But yes, yes I am. And if I don't fulfill this last wish, then you'll completely stop believing. And if one human stops believing in the magic of Christmas then it doesn't get carried on. And before you know it there will be no believers and it's the end of Christmas. And I still don't totally understand Christmas. But I know neither of us want it to end. I'm sorry. I didn't write a letter to Santa this year. But I think I know who did. - You? - No. - Blake? - No. - You? - No. - Your dog! - No, my Mom. She's been talking about how all she wants is for us to be a family again, to be happy. Whatever that means. I can't build that in a Workshop. Santa, wait. Hi, Mr. Claus. Uh, you look jolly this evening. Your sleigh awaits, sir. Santa, wait. Mindy, Cam and I, we lost a whole bag of letters. A town called Minnedoza, poof! And Mindy and Cam they travelled backwards through the mail system, and they've disguised themselves as human kids. And they've gone around talking to humans kids And finding out about their wishes and then relaying the message back so we can make it come true. I know. Isn't it wonderful? You knew? I see you are not freaking out about this as much as I am. There's still one wish left. Santa, I must insist you leave now. Or you jeopardize Christmas for the entire world. All right, George. Time to fly. Santa, wait. What should we do? What's that supposed to mean? Blake's Mom! Hey Mindy. Em, I'm so glad you made it. So, are you guys having fun? Yeah, yeah, uh... Mom, did you write a letter to Santa this year? How'd you know that? What present did you wish for? No, no, I didn't ask for a present. It was just more of a... silly wish. I just wanted my family to be happy for Christmas. Mindy, I'm sorry. I tried everything. I couldn't stop him. We're too late. Sammy, it's okay. I found the last wish. It's Blake's Mom. She just wants her family to be happy again for Christmas. We can't make that here. Then I'll have to make it here. I just need to figure out a way. Are you sure she just doesn't want a pair of socks? Everyone loves socks. Blake? Just go away. I can't get him to come out. I've tried every trick in the Human Studies book. Blake, open up. I did not try that. I can't remember. Can't remember what? Dad. I can't remember Dad. What was it like when he was up on stage reading the poem in front of the whole town? It was amazing. Blake, the last wish, it was your Mom's. Mom wrote a letter? Yeah, but Santa's already left the North Pole. We're too late for the Workshop. What do we do? We need to show Mom that we're still a family. T'was the night before Christmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. The stockings were hung by the chimney with care, in hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there. The children were nestled all snug in their beds, while visions of sugarplums danced in their heads. And Momma in her kerchief, and I in my cap... I... in my cap... Come on Blake. You can do it. Something's not right. - Oh no. What is she doing? - I don't know. What are you doing? Just hanging out with my brother on Christmas Eve. Okay. Where does the next verse start? When out on the lawn... When out on the lawn there rose such a clatter... I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. Away to the window, I flew like a flash, tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. It's working. It's working. But Cam, look. Why is she crying? Why is she crying? It didn't work? Sammy, it didn't work. I guess I was wrong about her wish. So that's it? We're too late? Really? We're too late? We ruined Christmas. Another Mindy mistake. Well, I guess we should head back to the North Pole. We've done enough damage here. Sorry, Blake. But I heard him explain, as he drove out of sight. Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night. - Well, that's a first. - A hippo! A hippo! - Yeah, you got it. 'Kay, kay, pause for two seconds. Who wants another hot cup of cocoa? - Me! - Dibs on marshmallows! Hey guys, were you guys in the basement today? No. My Love, If you are reading this, I guess that was the last trip to the hospital. We always said I could win this fight and... even though I didn't, I don't think I lost. I had you, Emma and Blake, and that makes me the luckiest man in the world. Life isn't easy by yourself, so remember you're never alone. And the four of us will always be a family. Hang up the mistletoe, I'll always be under it waiting for you. Mom, what's wrong? I found another present in the basement. Dad's toolbox? Looks like your father left us a surprise. How? This one says Blake. "Dear Blake. Today, you turned three. I told your Mom that I was going to make your cake, and it turned out to be a total disaster. You didn't seem to mind. You stuck your hand into the cake right before we could even light the candles. I can already tell quite the handful that you are going to be. Love, Dad." He was right. Mom, a postcard. From Paris? When was Dad in Paris? He went there for work when you were just a little baby. Dear Blake, Be sure to study up on your French, because when you are old enough to travel, we have to adventure through these cobblestone streets, in the most magical city in the world. And you'll love the crepes. Love, Dad. Oh no, homework. 365 things I love most about Emma. One for every day of the year. I love the way you laugh when we play Silly-Face-Em. What's Silly-Face-Em? A game Dad and I used to play. Like this - Graagh! Mom. Look. Merry Christmas everyone. Now this year, just like last year, I'd like to dedicate this poem to my family. Laura, Emma and Blake. I love you. T'was the night before Christmas and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse. Dad was funny. Oh yes, he was. Merry Christmas, Mom. Merry Christmas, honey. Merry Christmas, Jingle. Thank you, Santa. Santa. How was your flight, sir? Delightful George, thank you. Ah! Just the Elves I've been looking for. Santa, it's my fault. I thought there must have been a mistake About me being placed in the Mailroom, so I was so careless about all the humans' wishes that I made a mistake. Mindy, I thought Benny assured you earlier, There are no mistakes in the North Pole. But it's just that... Every job in the North Pole is as important as another. Just as each Elf has their own important role to play. I placed you in the Mailroom because although you are an excellent Builder, you have a great many other talents too. There was a wish this year that provided us with an opportunity to learn how to bring joy in an important new way. And I knew only the three of you would be able to fulfill it. But we didn't fulfill the last wish. Woah guys, hey that's Blake. Hi Blake. He can't hear you. I can't believe we actually did it. Wait, I don't get it. She's still crying. Did we ruin Christmas or save it? Oh Cam, look at how happy they are. Happy tears? Who'd have thought? Regardless, it's quite clear we definitely saved Christmas. Well, technically we did ruin it first. Yes, but then we saved it. I never doubted we would. Me neither. You brought more joy to the Williams family than we ever could have manufactured Here in the North Pole. And so, I'm launching a new initiative. Effective immediately, undercover Elves are going to live amongst humans, to hear those wishes that often go unheard and facilitate the act of fulfilling those wishes, 365 days of the year. Happiness levels will go through the roof. Now Mindy, would you still like to be transferred To the Builders' Workshop? Or... might I be able to convince the three of you to join our exciting new initiative? Yes. Oh my. I can still build part-time though, right? Perhaps we should adopt a human tradition and make the North Pole a little more festive. Human Expert. Leave it to me. Oh, and one more thing. Will someone please show me what this Moo Cow game is all about? Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho Ho... Are you two still dancing? Must... dance... my sadness... away. Everything's okay. Christmas wasn't ruined after all. That's another on time. Well sort of on time Christmas for the Time Elves. Oh... good... Cut! Cut! Big smiles, guys. Big smiles. We could probably use the help. It is delicious. Careful it's hot. I know-wha! It's her face! I need to stop looking at her face! Are you going to eat that? Are you going to eat that? Are you going to eat that? Are you going to eat that? Mail. Mail. Has this ever happened before? Sorry! I was... I got it! Letters! Sorry. Totally messed that up. Letters! Sorry, that was really bad. Yeah, but Slanta's already left on his slaigh. And we're too late for the workshop. Slanta? Oh no. What am I going to do now? Father Christmas. That was really bad. Hi. Hi! I forgot to try to hug him! - Three! - Wishes! Merry Christmas! Just a few Ho Ho Ho's, you'll be good to go. Who's following you? Is that my sweater?
