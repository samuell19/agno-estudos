What has happened to this city? Where there are ashes somewhere.. ..there's also smoke all around. Why does no one say anything? Why are people inhaling this smoke? That's enough now. Smoking is harmful for your health. Smoking in public areas is strictly prohibited. Those who break the law will be punished. Don't smoke nor let anyone smoke. Smoking will cost you dearly. Who doesn't want to be happy? But what is the cost of that happiness? Smoking can prove to be very harmful. Smoking in injurious to health. Smoking is injurious to people close to you too. Smoking will cost you dearly. "The problems are constant." "They are always going be around." "The pain is always going to be there." "It's known that the pain is going to be there." "Always and forever." "I am with you, forget all your worries." "I am with you, forget all your worries." "Come on, we'll handle it." "Come on, we'll handle it." "You only live once." "You only live once." "Come on, we'll handle it." "Come on, we'll handle it." "I became famous in the college campus." "I bunked my lectures and was chilling in the canteen." "I was busy sipping tea and chatting on Whatsapp." "I was so busy impressing my girlfriend.. ..that I forgot about my practical." "Come on, we'll handle it." "You only live once." "You only live once." "Come on, we'll handle it." Hey guys. Did you see a girl passing by? Uncle, why do you think we are standing here? Just to see girls passing by. Was this the girl? Uncle, we didn't see her face. But I definitely saw the tattoo on her leg. Uncle, I only saw the tattoo on her back. Uncle, I didn't even see her face. If you also wanted to see, you should've come here before us. Uncle, look at your age. You are over 50 years of age and you still haven't given up. You are still looking around for a girl at this age? Aren't you ashamed? You should feel embarrassed. You fool. I am her father. We got saved. Uncle, would have beaten us up black and blue. But how would we know.. ..that a girl's father must be looking.. ..for her around everywhere? I don't understand, what might the girl have possibly done? That's true. Forget all that, her father was really dangerous. We got saved by a fluke. "Phone's ring tone." "Phone's ring tone." How was it? What? Yes, okay. What about Amber? How about Tanki? Oh. I will call you back. Hang up the phone. Hang up now. Hang up. What happened? What's up? 50 rupees. This Maths is betraying me like a girlfriend. I just don't seem to get it. -Why? The ATKT(Allowed to keep terms) results have come for Maths. I failed. Don't feel so proud. Dear, I have been trying my luck.. ..at Maths for the past 4 years. You both are really lucky. You passed in Maths. Oh, so the grapes are sour. We worked hard for it. You guys act stupid when it comes to Maths. Maths needs understanding. What do you think? Lucks also needs hard work. Do you get it? I had written everything in the exam. My dear friends. It does as it pleases. You can't hold it responsible. Tanki, don't worry. We will succeed in the Maths paper this time. We'll handle it. We are good at Maths, brother. No problem. We'll handle it. Jigga, come in. You are here. Are you all alone in the room? Hey. Where is charger? Charger is taking a shower. He will be out in his own time. He will finish the water. Is this a time to take a shower? This is the limit. Jignesh, you came in early. I was thinking about you only. Why would you think of me in the bathroom? Is this the time to take a shower? You guys don't take a bath until 10am. It's the "Time-Machine's" lecture today. If we are late even by a minute, he won't let us in. Jigga, we'll reach on time. "Phone's ring tone." -You stress a lot. Calm down. "Phone's ring tone.". -The problem is always going to be there. It will be Google's phone. Where are you? Where do we start? Hi Baby. Where are you? Baby, I just reached the hostel. Now I am leaving for college. Don't be late. We are just leaving. See you at our regular place. At the college campus. Outside the lobby. Bye. Okay, bye baby. See you. Love you. Love you. Put on some music. We'll get in the mood. What's with you? He wants to listen to songs apparently. Who is taking our first lecture? Komal ma'am is taking our first lecture. So you are going to sleep in class. Jignesh, I just recollected. Please halt at a medical store. -Why? I'll have to take medicine for my headache. It matters if you pay attention to the lecture. You are so lost in Simran's dreams. Do something. -You don't need medicines for headache.. ..you need it to forget her. -That's true. Please halt at the medical store. Hey, please get it quickly. Jignesh. -Yes. Simran belongs to Raj. Don't forget that. When will he understand? Give me 5 of that medicine. Here. What's this? Protection? Young men like you ask for protection.. ..under the pretext of medicines. Give me what I asked for. Talking aimlessly. You should have given it to your father. Would have spared us your horror. Listen, give me the toothpaste and brush too. Yes. Here you go. Should I take it in my pocket? Give me a carry bag. We don't give out carry bags. It's banned. What? -It's banned. What exactly? It's banned. Oh, is that so? -Yes. That's great. You follow all the rules, is it? -Yes. Give me a bill for all this. Here you go. How much do I have to pay? 80 rupees. Here you go. Thanks. It took you so long. Keep quiet. I couldn't find a diaper for your size. What's that? Rules are meant to followed and not broken. Keep this in mind. Hey. I can see her entire back from here. These days.. ..girls might not show you face but you can see their backs. "Baby." This is our Shilpi. How did she find a new guy? Hey. She is ours. Go and ask for her clothes. You can wear it then. It will even fit you. You should have taken admission in Computer classes. You at least wouldn't have to stand outside the class. If you had taken admission in Computer classes.. ..you would have got the chance to see Simran everyday. That is true. Let's do something. Girls don't take admission in mechanical engineering. For us, we only see men around everywhere. What did you ever do for our class? With great difficulty, we are getting through each semester. Don't worry. As it is, we are doing a Fresher's.. ..party for the mechanical stream. You can introduce yourself to a few girls. Okay. You are really concerned about the Fresher's party, right? I know everything. To get introduced to girl from Computer classes.. ..you are putting up a Fresher's Party. While they are at it, we will try to woo Riya. They seem to have a problem with it. She is not just anyone. Address her as sister-n-law Riya. Hey, sister-in-law Riya is here. Charger, you girl is right behind. Hello. Hello. -How are you? I am fine. Look here, it's Raj. He waits here for you every single day. He has been after you for the past three years. I see it everyday. I am not a doctor to cure him of his love sickness. I am getting late. I will see you during the break. Bye. -Bye. Come on, let's begin our preparation. Let's go. I will pee and then go to class. You always have to pee. Do it quickly. We are getting late. Hey. This seems like her bottle. She must be in the washroom. Do you have the medicine to clears bowel movement? I always keep it with me. What do we have to do? I am not deaf. Speak softly. She likes to keep sipping water. We will add that to this bottle of water. The lecture will be fun today. If we get caught, we will be in trouble. How can that be? -You keep drinking water, don't you? Do a thing, pour that medicine. I am here. Don't worry. Do it quickly. Do it quickly. Come on, let's go now. It's going to be fun now. Hey, look your Shilpi. Shilpi, do you have red thing with you today? What did you say? Adi wants it. Do you have a red pen? -No. She is acting pricey. Come on, let's go. Good morning ma'am. Good morning. Sit down. "Children chattering." Silence. Today, we will be learning about.. ..the advantages of Java Script and its needs. Look at my hand. Rahul, can you stand up? So, tell me. What did we learn yesterday? Ma'am, can I answer in Gujarati? In which ever language you are comfortable in.. ..answer in that language. Ma'am, yesterday.. Ah.. Ah.. I knew it. I recollected it just a minute ago. Shut up. Adi, stand up. Tell me, What did we learn yesterday? What? Keep quiet. What did we learn yesterday? Yesterday? Yesterday! Say it. Yesterday? Yesterday! Yesterday? Say it. I know the answer but I can't frame it. Shut up. Sit down. Silence. Why were you all laughing? Do you understand what discipline means? You all are final year students. You will have your campus interviews in a few days. Which company will hire you? Oh. I hope I don't have to.. ..give a memo out. Maintain discipline in the class. Shut up. Jignesh, is this your phone or a treasury box? There are so many locks to this. Dad, you won't get it. For get it. Here son, eat it. Mom, I am done. Eat properly. You won't eat anything in college then. -We have a canteen. You have two friends in the college right? Ask them, how difficult it is to manage without parents. Mom, you made me remember something. I have to go to the hostel and wake them up. You have to wake them up? Are you going to kidnap them? Dad, you don't know what I am talking about. Once I go to the hostel and wake them up.. ..it takes an hour for us to make it to college. Come on now, I will take your leave. Bye. Take your bag along. Okay. Bye mom, bye dad. -God bless you. What are you doing? Keep that down. You are yet to take the diabetes medicine. I will get it. There are two types on engines. One is called petro engine and the other.. May I come in, sir? -May I come in, sir? Come on in. Move. You are late by a minute, today. Get up. I said, stand up. Answer my questions. What is the difference between a petrol Engine.. ..and a diesel engine? You have moved on from a scooter to a car so quickly. Congratulations. Sir, the diesel engine is nice. What are you talking about? Take the CNG. It's 40 rupees per kilo. So if your wife is coming along, it won't be a problem. Out. Sir, listen. The diesel engine.. Get out. Sir, the CNG works very smoothly. I am telling you. If you like petrol, get the petrol one. Why are you troubling poor boys like us? I said, get out. Let's go. Hey. Please sit. -Sir. Come on, get out. You make him sit in a vehicle without engine. Let's go. Popat. -They are here. Why did you call me that? How does that matter? No matter the size, a name is a name. The smaller Popat serves only water. The bigger Popat serves tea. Remember this. So, Big Popat, get us four half teas. Hey. -Yes. I am the big Popat and He is the small Popat. The big Popat will only get tea. Do you get it? Okay, please get us four half teas. Okay. Do you get it? Hey, you. You! Hooligan! Popat, give him a lollipop. Go away. Go away. Finish it quickly. Then we have to go to watch a Sunny Leone movie. It's going to be crowded. Riya's mom dad aren't home today. So, we have a different program today. It will get crowded. Let's leave. Litti, do you want to join us? Hooligan. Let's go. You want to eat this? Come on, in. -Yes. Hello. Jigs, these are my cousins. Gitesh. -Hello. Ajay. -Hello. Jimmy. -Hi. Jiya. -Hi. All of them know you very well. -They know me? -Yes. Riya always talk about you. Really? -Right. Please sit down. I will get juice for you. I like the couple. -Riya, baby. -Yes. You had told me that your parents aren't home. -Yes. My parents aren't home. Where did they come from? My parents have gone out with my uncle and aunt. But the kids are around. Please sit, I will get you juice. Oh God. "I came here for something else.. ..and now I will have to adjust." One Cheese Garlic Bread and.. ..a Margarita Pizza. Yes sir. Thank God we came alone. We came to see Sunny Leone. What's your problem? We had to get out within 15 minutes. He had to pee again. Remove your bag. Yes. Charger. Someone's here to light up your life. Hey, keep it to yourself. I only belong to Simran. Remember this. Oh wow. She is classy. How did this one find such a nice girl? Boys like us are so unlucky. Yes, that' true. When you are unlucky.. If we dream about Sunny Leone, that's enough for us. God blesses people with such women.. ..who are not worthy of it. Fools, that's enough. You have scanned her through and through. Stop it now. You just let it be. What's your problem if we are looking at her? Eat the Pizza. There's so much space and there's so much pizza here. It's okay if you don't want to eat. -At least let me concentrate. You concentrate on eating. We will concentrate on ogling at her. Hey Tanki. When will we get so lucky? That's true. Oh God. Are you done? Let's go now. Good morning sir. Good morning sir. Hey, you! Come here. How many did you trap today? -What? Tanki means how many people have you.. ..buttered up with 'Good morning sir'? We mean how many have you trapped? In terms of business. How many 'Good morning' did you sell today? Grow up, guys. You are in the last year of college. Gujarati boys like you will end of nowhere. You will just be here. Hey, how dare you talk about Gujaratis? You have no idea where great Gujarati.. ..men have done for themselves. What do you think of Gujaratis? The Prime Minister of India.. ..Narendra Modi is Gujarati. The one, who threw the Britishers out.. ..and gave India independence.. ..that great man, Mahatma Gandhi is Gujarati. 70% of the rich men in India.. ..are Gujarati. Half of our population has reached Canada and America. If you ever go to America.. ..you will get to see an entire society of Gujaratis. The Stock Market thrives on Gujarati. If Gujaratis stop doing business.. ..the stock market will fall. Go and find out the role of.. ..Gujaratis in the development of the country. The world has accepted Gujarat's development model. Have you heard of Surat? The amount of money people in Surat.. ..spend on eating and traveling.. ..you can't do it in a year. If you ever get a place in a restaurant on a.. ..weekend in Surat, it seems like a victory. Surti locho recipe (Gujarati food).. ..is famous around the world. Do you know what a Locho is? A fool like you will know nothing. Forget all that. Let's talk business. The diamond market in Surat.. ..is famous all over the world. The tourism of the entire country.. ..thrives on Gujaratis. Get out to travel.. ..and you will definitely find one person who is a Gujarati. Gujaratis have.. ..a big heart. Even if we get a holiday for two days.. ..Gujaratis step out to travel. Take any multinational company. The turnover that it has over a year.. ..a Gujaratis spends more than that in the.. ..three months before and during Diwali. Forget all that. After passing out of engineering, you dream of having a job. All the companies like Reliance.. ..Adani, Wipro have Gujaratis as their owner. The Amul milk that made you who you are.. ..the owner of that company is also a Gujarati. How about that? "Indian drinks Amul Milk." Useless. Useless. These non-Gujaratis think too much of themselves. He thinks he knows everything. But he doesn't know that.. ..be it business or studies.. ..or wooing girls.. ..a Gujarati tops it all. Forget all this. -We have our Viva now. We have a lot to study. He just keeps harping about how much we have to study. We will handle the Viva. We have submissions. Hope you remember. Come on now. Time machine is in. Come on. Let's go. I haven't made an index. You are talking about writing the index? My book is still incomplete. But Adi, the stationary is out the college premise. How do we go to buy it? That's true. I had so much trouble filling this file. Hey Adi, listen. We will take someone's index and certificate. Then we'll see what happens. What are you talking about? Make him understand. If she gets to know, you are dead. Then sit with your armor. Tanki, it's Komal ma'am. She will fail you in your internal exams. That's true. All the best. -Thank you. Where is your certificate? Where is the certificate in this? The cow ate it. The cow ate it? What have you been reading? Newspaper. I didn't read the newspaper. I read our textbooks only. Adi sits with the newspaper early in the morning. He doesn't give it back at all. Ma'am, he's lying. He looks at pictures of women in the newspaper. You are lying. -I am not lying and.. -Shut up. People like you will complete their engineering.. ..and sell newspapers only. Next question. What is Java Script? Java? Java. Java. Java script? Java. Java. Java. Let us go. Get out. Thank you ma'am. Ma'am, don't forget to give us marks. I said get out. Send the next two students in. "Student mumbles." Jignesh and Charger are not yet here. They must have utilized the entire.. ..time of the Viva & the submission. I think so too. They must have had it from the professor. Let's enjoy this movie. Adi, your dad doesn't know, right? That the laptop he gave you to study.. ..is being used for other purposes. That's not so. 500 GB data is filled with movies. There's no space to add software. Jignesh, you didn't submit? No, I did the submissions. But ma'am has given me further corrections. I will have to re-submit post exams. What happened to charger? Charger, why do you look sad? What happened? I am going to talk openly today. What do the professor think of themselves? She said to bring forth a novel idea in the project. Novel? This.. Since the past 6 months.. ..we have been working so hard on this project. But this professor doesn't find.. ..anything novel in this project. My life is hell since I have joined engineering. As a sudden surprise.. ..you get to know that you have to.. ..study Maths for two more years. Wasn't it enough that we were studying.. ..Maths until the 12th grade? Why did they add it to every semester? It seems like a war. He got crazy trying to understand Maths. The best thing is when the exam time table is out. Knowingly, they make the time-table in such a way.. ..that all of our vacations get spoiled with endless studying. When our entire family is traveling.. ..we are busy trying to figure out the syllabus. Our professors give us a list of ten book to refer from. Books that are so big. -When we sit to refer.. ..we don't find anything related to our syllabus. Then, finally we resort to reading photocopies. Wow, that's great. Even more worse is the day of the submission. Our professors.. ..scare us saying that they will detain us. They use it as a weapon against us. We have the first test, then the mid-test.. ..then the internals and then the.. ..submissions and external test. They have made engineering a crazy affair. We stay awake all night like night-owls. Then struggle and work hard during the entire day. Even worse is the exams. The topics that we have relentlessly studied.. ..they won't ask that. They will ask us everything that we left as an option. Even more interesting.. ..is the day of the result. The subject we are confident about, we fail in them. And the subject we know we will fail in, we pass in them. All that we have confidently studied for 6 months.. ..is destroyed by one result. No one can understand what we go through. Adi, you had a lot to ask, right? Did you hear it all? This is the state of every engineering student. We are so confident when we take up science as a subject. The four years of engineering takes a toll. Forget that. Let's go out. We need to freshen our mind. Come on. Tanki, it's your turn. Why should I? My father isn't a millionaire. It was my turn yesterday. It is your turn today. Come on. Go on. Why are you keeping a count? We don't keep count on who gives and takes in friendship. Jignesh, make him understand. There's no count that we keep in friendship. I will get four half teas for all of us. Tea? -No. Nobody refuses now. All of you will have tea. It's on me. Nobody refuses. Hey, listen up. Come here. Hey. What tea? It's your turn so you are getting us tea. What about when it is my turn? Cold Coffee. Grilled Sandwich. Sizzling Brownie with Ice-cream. Aren't you ashamed? Get Cappuccino for Jignesh and me. Okay bro. Get me that first one. Tell me the name? That first one. Which one? The one that I drink everyday. You drink my blood everyday. Not that. I don't remember it now. Do a thing, get me a cold coke. Cold coke it seems. And listen. -Tell me. With Ice-cream. With Ice-cream. Adi. Now, you tell me. Two Appachino for you, right? It's Cappuccino. Yes, yes. -Go on. Go away. Brothers. Sit here. I knew it. Here you go. Appachino. -Hey. So the thing is.. If you need tea, we'll order that. You have sent a very nice video in the group. All his videos are good. Your collection is really good. Where do you get so many videos from? You have to experience it and not talk about it. Do you get it? Let's finish the coffee and go home. I have already got so many missed calls from Riya. I have to talk to her for two hours and then I can sleep. It's your doing. It's the campus interview tomorrow. Hope you remember. Be there on time. Clean up well. Don't think I am your dad. As it is, I am going to fly off. You will go to America. That's nice. How sweet. Can't you hold a conversation without touching? It's his habit. It's his character. Anyway, you were supposed to go to America, right? Why are you giving the interview then? Interviews are important for confidence building. There's a standard that you need to keep. When do you have to go? Leave now. What is your name? Gujarat, Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh. What? Raju. -What Raju? Get out. Next please. Okay. What is your name? Jigga, I mean Jignesh. Full name please. Jignesh Bhai Govardhan Bhai Patel. So tell me, why did you select mechanical engineering? I chose engineering because my dad chose it. I didn't chose engineering. Tell me, your strength and weaknesses. My friends are my strength. And my weakness.. I don't have any weaknesses. Good. Who is your role model? Right now, it's Katrina. Who Katrina? Our Katrina. Katrina Kaif. Okay, tell me. Have you ever got first class in any exams? Since the first semester, till now.. ..if you add up all the results, then I get a first class. Very good progress. -Thank you. Give me two reasons of why we should.. ..select you in our company? Sir, if you hire me in your company.. ..I will take your company to.. ..I will take your company to great heights. Get down now. You are not selected for this job. Get out. I am not here to work in your stupid company. I will make my own company. That too in America. Please. -Your English is nice. I will call you to work in my company. Please get out. What? -Hmm. What? -My files. Thank you. Next please. Introduce yourself. Raj, Jiger's friend. Who Jiger? That Jigga. That boy who just rejected your company. That's what Jigga thinks. I don't mind even if the company is small. I just need the salary to come on time. Tell me. How do you see yourself after ten years? Ten years? After ten years, sir. Yes. I will be father. Good. How do you deal with pressure in critical condition? Pressure? The Public toilet. That relieves pressure. All it takes is two rupees. Please get out. Please leave. Sure? -Get out. Next please. Hello sir. What is your name? Liti. What Liti? Do you have a pen and pad? Give it to me. This is how you spell 'Liti. Is this Liti? Get out. Hooligan. The exams are round the corner. This engineering is hell. That's true. It's taking away our life. Hey, listen up boys. It's my sister Priya's marriage. All of you must be there. But we have exams then. Jigga, have fun. These days, before the priest sets up the wedding time.. ..he ask if there's an engineering student in the house. Then he fixers up the auspicious time. Adi, if you have a function at your place.. ..we'll definitely be there. All of us will be there. When is the wedding? The next month. Oh, is it so? Liti, why are you running? Let me go. I have my period now. So you are running off to get sanitary pads? Just shut up. If you trouble me, you will be a goat in the next birth. That too a female one. Liti, goats are female only. He says anything. You know it, right? Hooligan. Hey, hey. It's your period, run. Oh God. The exams are right around the corner. We will have to stop wasting time and start studying. Jigga, I recollected.. ..we have to change and go for the tax class. -Surely. "Check it out." Wow. Yes. Jigga. Ready! -Oh God. -Oh God. -Go away. What are you reading? Here, you read. Oh God. It's not meant for you, dear. Hey Raj. Please give it to me. Hey, what do you want? Pen. Pant? -Not Pant as in trousers. I meant pen. Go to him. He will give it to you. Oh. Hey. Come on. "In just sometime, the exams will begin." "If you have worked hard, the results will be good." "Be awake for a few nights." "Fulfill all your dreams." "I am giving my exams, but I know nothing." "Whatever I have studied, hasn't come in the paper." "What do I do? Where do I go? " "What do I do? Where do I go? " "The problems are always going to be around." "The pain will also be there." "Even people say the problem will always be there." "Always and forever." "I am with you. Forget all your worries." "I am with you. Forget all your worries." "Come on, we'll handle it. " "Come on, we'll handle it. " "I will be the topper of the university." "I will fulfill my dad's dream." "Come on, we'll handle it. Come on, we'll handle it. " "Come on, we'll handle it. Come on, we'll handle it. " The exams are over. Now, we will have peace for five months. I am thinking of starting Maths right from the beginning. In the end, it gets very difficult. After every semester, you say the same thing. Did you ever start studying from the start? Baby, I am going out tonight. Even I am going to my uncle's place in Junagadh. Really? -After a few days, we are planning to go to Diu. You can also join us. Okay. I will try. Oh God. Hey, is this Simran's father? How are you? -I am fine. Riya, where does Simran stay? She stays near Junagadh. She is going to be there for her vacations. But Simran is in Ahmadabad.. -Yes, in Ahmadabad. But she said that she will go to her village for vacations. Oh. Oh. Simran is going to be close to me during her vacations. I am late. Mom & dad must be waiting for me. I will call you later. Okay? Bye. Bye. -Bye. -Bye. Bye. Tanki & Charger. Have you spoken at home? About what? -Oh yes, I spoke to my mother. She was sad that I wouldn't be around even during my vacation. I told my mother that it's Adi's sister wedding. I have to go. Even my mom called me and asked me a zillion questions. Mom gets more tensed than dad. -Of course. She will be stressed. You don't go home for months, she will definitely be stressed. Should we leave? We need to go tomorrow morning. Jigga, be there on time. I will be there. You get up on time. Let's get going tomorrow morning. Race? Greetings. Yes, let me see. All the decoration is done, isn't it? -Mom. You are here, son. Come on. Greetings. -Come on. My dear son. Aunty, how are you? -I am good. -How are you, uncle? All good. Don't they feed you in the hostel? You have become so thin. Sister-in-law, all they eat is junk food from outside. That's the reason they become thin. It's nice that Adi came a day early. And even you guys could join him. How could I not come for your wedding, Priya? This is my friend, Kavita. He is my brother, Adi. Hello Kavita. All good. This is his friend, Raj. Hi. -Hi. This is Jignesh. Hello. -Hi. This is Rahul. How are you? Will you keep standing here? Go and freshen up. I will get you all something to eat. Yes, stuff them up nicely. Her dear son is here. I will have to do it. Come on in. -Go on. Tanki will have to pee now. How were your exams? Mine was good. I don't know about them. Charger, ours was better compared to you. Calm down. It was a breeze for Tanki. Engineering is very difficult, isn't it? -That is true. We will take your leave. You guys have your snacks. -Yes, sure. Let's go. -Bye. Adi. Kavita is a beauty. What I am trying to say is.. ..why don't you ask Priya to set me up? Have your snacks. He wants to set himself up. Charger, what's your problem.. ..if I am getting into a relationship? Wait dear. First, I will set myself up and then you. Boys, did you eat? -Yes aunty. Aunty, your snacks were great. Yes. We are going to roam. Go if you want, but don't be late. -Yes. Adi, if I need to pee? Go there. You leave, I will be back. Let's go. I spoke to the flower guy. I spoke to the cook too. Dolly will be here. I need to get the necklace. Son, are you going to the market? -Yes. Ask Lala. That Somabhai Jhaveri. We need to get Priya's necklace from there. Her father spoke to him. You get it from there. Okay, aunty. We will get it. That's done. What else is left? I need to call Bor Baba. Are you done? Let's go. Take so much time. What a nice place. I wish Riya was here. Hey. Everything is romantic for you. "I wish Riya was here." What would you do then? Would you bathe in the river? People like him can't have fun with girlfriend. The sit up close and tight while watching a film. Yes. The theater is dark. So many couple sit so close in the garden. No shame at all. There are families sitting out there. Kids playing around. They aren't bothered at all. They will start wherever they find the place. Charger, you are correct. Our Jigga is well under control. -Exactly. He tries once or twice, but always gets trapped. You are saying this because you don't have a girlfriend. Once you have a girlfriend, you will be the same. That's fine. I am feeling really thirsty. Hey, don't start again. Sit there quietly. Tanki is talking about drinking water for the first time. It's usually him wanting to pee. Uncle, water. Oh dear. That was nice. Why are you laughing? Dear, this water was meant for washing. You drank it all. I will have to fill it again. We had given a necklace on order for a wedding. We are here to collect it. Yes, I had spoken to sir and he had told me.. ..that four boys will be here to collect it. Are you those four boys? -Yes. Call and confirm once. Yes, that's a nice idea. Sir, greetings. Like you said, four people are here. To take that necklace. Shall I give it? Okay. I am giving it to them. Give them that necklace. Here's your necklace. -Greetings. -Greetings. That's so nice. Come on. -Mom. Look at this. -You are here. We knew that you were going to forget.. ..so he went ahead and got it himself. Son. Go and sit at one place. You must not watch videos all day. Go. Go now. Topa. Topa. Hey. Which necklace did we get then? I think there has been a big misunderstanding. I think, aunty spoke about Somabhai Jhaveri. You think? Are you sure? Topa. This is a big misunderstanding. Uncle, please keep this bag. Okay. -We are going out. Okay. -Uncle, we are going out. -Okay. Today, we will have to settle this. Get the bag out. The necklace isn't here. What are you saying? It must be inside. Check. -Here you go. See. Topa. Topa. Topa. We are in a soup. Don't put it on me now. Boys. Uncle. -Your parents. Uncle, there's a problem. -What happened? We had kept a necklace in this bag. We can't find it now. Necklace? Which necklace? Priya wore that, right? Uncle, not that one. We are talking about a different one. Another one? -Did someone open this bag? No, no one opened this bag. But which necklace are you talking about? Because of this Tanki.. ..we got a necklace from another jeweler too. That necklace was in this bag. What are you saying? -Yes, uncle. We can't find that necklace. What will we do now? Uncle, we'll handle it. Let's all hit Tanki. Who is the owner of the house? I am the owner. What happened? Your boys took away his necklace. No, that's not possible. I will call my son. Hey, come downstairs. Sit down. Calm yourself. Talk politely. Who are you? -I am DK. My name is DK. Charger. Your father-in-law came in looking for you. Topa. How will I know? What's my father-in-law doing here? Come on. You took the necklace. I am here to take my necklace back. Which necklace. -DK's necklace. No. We got the necklace that we ordered for. They are here. Ask them. Yes, these were the boys.. ..who took your necklace. Oh, is that so? When my daughter was young.. ..I made these necklace out of the ornaments she had. It was my mom's wish that.. ..whenever Simran gets married.. ..her husband should tie it to her neck. And this what you did? Sir, my parents know nothing of it. Mistakenly, we.. ..got that necklace. More than that necklace.. ..the sentiments are more important to me. And so, give me my necklace. Sir, there's problem. The necklace got stolen from the bag. Don't make me angry. Or you will have to bear its consequences. Sir, we are speaking the truth. The necklace is stolen. You won't give it so easily. I don't want to go to the cops. Until I get my necklace.. ..one of you will be with me. Tell me, who will accompany me? -Charger. Charger, get ready. You won't get time later. Until then we can look for the necklace. I give you five days. If I don't get my necklace in five days.. Until you get the necklace.. ..don't even come close to my house. Charger. Let's go. Come on. We will have to send Charger to his in-laws place. This is your doing. You. -Hey. Why did you give my name? Charger, listen to me. Simran is about to get married. You have five days. Try and evoke feeling in Simran for you. You always said that Simran belongs to Raj. Go, go live your life. I pity Charger, nothing happened in three years. And then today.. You go if you want to. I don't know where he will take me. I don't know here he will take you. But I am confidant.. ..you will handle him. Pack my bag. Go on. -Charger will handle everything. Hey. Where is Mukesh? Where is he? Who will help with the marriage preparation now? He is sick. So, he can't make it. -What? Who will help with the marriage preparation now? Bannerilal, don't worry. Everything will be arranged. Do one thing. Take him to our out house. Keep an eye on him. Don't let him go until I tell you so. Sir, listen to me. Keep me here. I will handle the marriage preparations. I used to do all this in college too. That's nice. We found our man of the hour. Okay. Entrust him with the work. You understand all that needs to be done. Listen, keep an eye on him. Yes. -He shouldn't run away. -Yes sir. Get to know everything properly. Come on. Everything will be good. "Father-in-law, I won't just work.. ..I will elope with her." Hey, come on. Yes. -Yes, let's go. Let me tell you everything. -What? My name is Bhagu Bhai. What sort of name is that? My aunt kept this name. What's your name? -Raj. Raj? Who is Raj? I am Raj. So, your name is Raj. Okay. So Raju Bhai! Bhagu Bhai, just Raj. Then who is Raju Bhai? I don't know. Raju Bhai! Yes. Bhagu Bhai! -Yes. -Who is getting married? My Chakudy. Who Chakudy? -My niece. Oh, so her name is Chakudy? Okay. What does your niece do? -Her real name is Simran. But I gleefully address her as Chakudy. Oh. -She is in the city.. ..to learn to fix computers. -Okay. -Yes. This lad in my village.. ..learnt to fix the computer without a degree. He know to repair the television. He repairs almost everything. -Wow. But my Chakudy has been in the city for three years. She still hasn't learnt to repair a computer. She still hasn't succeeded. This is what it is. Bhagu Bhai. You get the girl married off so soon? Yes, her father wasn't keeping too well.. ..so we thought of getting her married as soon as possible. After this, there is no auspicious time until next 6 months. Everything will be good. Oh. Which is this family? -That same one. Okay. Who is she getting married to? To the village Sarpanch's (village head) son. Is that so? What does the boy do? He does a lot of work. But we believe that.. .. he will score well in his final term. But.. Bhagu Bhai. Chakudy, right? She is still studying. So she is still agreed for this alliance? Are you a teacher? You are asking so many questions. That's your room. Is that okay? I will finish off my work. Go now. Go to your room. Go. I haven't seen Simran since long. So I am not getting the vibe. I will have to see Simran. Then I’ll be all charged. Simran, I am coming. Chakudy. Raj. What brings you here? Just.. I came looking for you. -Just shut up, okay. How did you get to my house? In your dad's car. Your dad got me here. To organize your wedding. Don't tell your dad that you know me. Or he will throw me out. But how did you meet dad? It's a long story. By the way, it's commendable. A software engineer and.. That's a nice couple. Don't act smart. My dad isn't keeping well.. ..so I have to get married. Oh. So you have to. So that means you don't want to. My family's choice is my choice. I won't speak about you at home.. ..you don't mention about my wedding in the college. I will see. You have a nice house. You can see everything far of. -Mom, this.. Aunty, how are you? I am fine. -Raju Bhai. Raju Bhai, what are you doing here? It's not "Raju Bhai", it's Raj. Whatever it is. I have to manage everything, so I am taking a look. Sister, Bannerilal has sent him over. For the marriage preparations. -Raju! Do everything properly. Aunty, that's the reason I am here. Don't worry.. I will put my heart and soul.. ..into not getting Chakudy married. I mean to get her married. What did you think? Nothing as such. Raju Bhai, we don't have work in just one room. We have a lot of pending work. Come on. Let's go. Yes, let's go. Alright Aunty. Bye. -Bye. Bye Chakudy. -Bye Raju Bhai. Come on, let's go. Enough of goodbyes. That's too many goodbyes for one time. He is a very nice boy. -Yes. Adi. -Yes. Stop smoking. Before us, you will die. Jigga, I have almost quit it. I am stressed so I am smoking. Last day today. I am listening to this since the past three years.. ..Adi. -Uncle. Chiku, you? -Lala uncle. Uncle, give me a chocolate. He has never had one. How will he give it to you? That's okay if you don't give me a chocolate. I will show this video to mom. -Show it to me. Let me see. Check if there is some other video too. Hey, Priya's friend Kavita took the necklace. See. Hey. -That's Kavita. We will have to call Charger. -Call him quickly. Charger. I am sending across a video. Show it to your father-in-law. Hey. If I show him your kind of video, he will throw me out. Charger, this is the video of the.. ..person who stole the necklace. Don't waste anymore time and show it to him. What are you saying? Send me the video. My father-in-law is just leaving. Send it quickly. -Yes. Sir, sir! Sir, just a second. This phone has the video of the person who stole the necklace. Please see it once. You may know her. Please. Just one time. Can you see the necklace here? Can you see the necklace here? Is that all you do? Do you even work? Stop all this. Concentrate on your work. Go away. What a man. He won't let me get married. Let me find it and then we'll talk. Even my phone's switched off. Me? One second. Did you call me? What were you showing my father? Your father? Nothing as such. We did this couple dance at the Fresher's party, right? Yes. -A video of that. Don't joke. Tell me the story. Do you want to hear about it? -Yes. Okay. It's a long story. Years and years ago, there was a King.. Raj. Not Raj. It's the king. Are you done? Can you tell me the real story now? Sorry. Listen. What are they doing together? There's something definitely happening. Something great is going to happen. So, this is the story. Now I know why dad is so stressed. Don't worry. Dad will let you go if I speak with him. No, don't say anything now. -Let the boys look for the necklace. They are lazy, they won't do anything. That's a memento of your childhood. Raj, they are engineers, not detectives. If they don't find it.. ..you can then call your father and save us. Alright. As you say. By the way, there's pink teddy bear in your room. It has a sign which says 'Someone special.' Is it for me? It's getting very late. Go now. Someone will see you. One day, I will be your 'Someone special.' Did Charger show the video? His phone is switched off. Let's do one thing. Instead of waiting for him here.. ..what if we go to his father-in-law's house? Yes, we must go. I hope he is not in trouble. Come on, let's go. That DK is sitting there. I hope you remember. He will kill us. He told us to not go there. We'll handle all that. We'll handle it. -Let's go. Jigga. Adi. Look here. Kavita is here. I want to meet DK sir. Okay. Charger's phone is still switched off. Let's call Simran. Let ask her to connect us to Charger. There should be no mistake this time. Let's do one thing. We will go in and catch Kavita red handed. Come on. -Let's go. Hey. Hello. Just a minute. Have you forgotten your way? That.. Everything will be good. No.. Are you here to put up the lights? Yes. -Yes. The lights need to go up in the lawn, not here. Where are your things? It's here. -On it's way. Let's go in. -It took you so long. Oh. We have to light up this entire space, okay? You see the corner there, the lights need to go up there too. There's lot of work left. A lot of work. But everything is going to be great. Oh. Hey, guys. We are here to look for Kavita. Let's find her. Come on! Hey. Hey! Hey you! -Is this your garden? How did you come in? -We came to save you. Switch on your phone. Did you show your father-in-law that video? Tell us that. Who sent me that video? Tanki sent that video. What was in that video? Hey, what was in that video? What do you mean? Kavita's video. What else? Was it Kavita or your naked model? Hey. -Tanki, you are dead. What's happening? Hey. You tarnished my image in front of my father-in-law. Hey, Charger. -No, Charger. -Hey. Don't do it. -Hey. Hey, run away. This is my father-in-law. Run. -Run, come on. Oh God. Charger, the thief is here only. -What are you saying? Where? -What are you doing here since so long? People are waiting for you out there with things. All you do is eat lollipop all day. Don't we have to light up this place? We are here to check. You don't have to light it up here. You have to put the lights there. Raju Bhai, all the things need to be at the farm house. You get the car, I will go to the office and be right back. Hey, you. Shall I accompany you? You don't need to go there. Hey, stay quiet. He calls the washroom the 'Office'. Do you want to go there? Listen to me. Forget everything else. Before Bhagu Bhai comes, hide in the car. In the car? So that he doesn't see you. We have to go out, don't we? -Come on, quickly. There's so much work left. I don't know when her wedding will get over. Thank God, Raju Bhai is here. I am relaxed because of him. Everything is going to be good. Let me finish the other work. Come on. Bhagu Bhai! Bhagu Bhai! Bhagu Bhai will take care of everything. Take a left. Yes. Raju Bhai, I have to give out invites to everyone here. So I am going. Everything is going to be great. Yes. Go on. Come on quickly. Finally. Hey, this is Kavita. She is dead. What happened? Charger, Kavita's dead body is in the car. What do we do? It's the dead body. Jigs! Jigs! Hi. -There's no network in Mumbai.. ..and still she has found you here. Baby, what are you doing here? We spoke on the phone. I am supposed to go out with my cousins. There was no network, so I couldn't hear. But where are you guys going? We are.. We are going to the same place. -Okay. Who is she? Tanki's girlfriend. Kavita. -Yes. You got a girlfriend already? Charger helped me. But why is she sleeping? The thing is.. Say it. Say it. She had some hard drinks unknowingly. Is that so? I am getting late. See you around. Bye. -Bye. Bye. Love you. All done. Bye. Bye. Can't you see? Listen. Come here. I will have to go back or DK will think I ran away. You guys are going to Diu? -Yes. Dump the body there. Get the car back in the evening. Come on, quickly. Hey. Hey, what are you doing? Oh. Oh God, save me. Ghost. Ghost. Ghost. Ghost. Ghost. Ghost. Ghost. Ghost. Ghost. Ghost! Ghost. Ghost. -Ghost. There is a Ghost.. Keep quiet. Why are you guys so scared? No. -Not at all. -No. What's in the car? That.. That he wants to.. -What? Yes sir. He wants to pee. What's in the car? There's nothing in the car, sir. What? Jigga, I will pee right here. I am so scared. I don't even have a girlfriend. If the cops arrest us, no one will wed me to their daughter. That's true. What is it? He is here. There is nothing in the car. But you can't halt your car mid-way. Go on. Yes. Yes sir. -Yes. Go on. Where did she go? Hey. The dead body is not to be found here. The dead body is missing? -Thank God. Thank God, we are out of trouble. Topa, because of you we will have to drive until Diu. You won't get rid of your habits, Topa. Come on, now. Sit in the car. Simran. Bhagu Bhai wanted a party in the evening. What do you want? Actually, it's Vikram's birthday today. -He is going to be here. So please arrange for a cake and the DJ. Oh. So we have to welcome the groom today, right? We will have to welcome him. Simran. -Yes. Shall I ask you something? -Yes please. Are you happy? -Yes. I am happy. Thanks. I got my answer. See you at the party. Guys. Let's dance. I will be back. Come on guys. You are looking beautiful. -Thanks. Are you going to marry this guy? I have no other choice. What about me? Charger, I am going to get married. Stop trying to woo me. Come on Simran. That's our moral right as men. It's our moral right to reject you too. Your marriage? God knows. It will happen. But it hasn't yet. Cheers. -Simran! Simran! Simran, let's dance. Come on. "Bhagu Bhai singing." Bhagu Bhai. -Yes. You dear niece is.. You like her, don't you? Everything is going to be great. Simran, dance with me. Nice. Hi. Greetings aunty. -Greetings. Wow. Come on guys. Acting too smart, eh? Are you new here? Is it so? Yes, I am. I came four days ago. Do you have a problem? You are talking way too much. A servant like you is hitting the owner's friend. Sir, the friends that you have.. ..tell them to not act like ruffians. You! -Vikram, please. Simran, go away. Simran is my fiancée. When I don't have a problem, who are you to interfere? Who am I? I am beyond your imagination. Do you get it? If anyone touches Simran without her consent.. .. I will break their hands. You won't know.. ..what to do with those broken hands. Aunty, take care. Son, bye. Tell your friends to not create a scene like that. Or you won't get married. If you behave well, everything will be fine. "Our dear heart." "Take away my heart. It's yours." "Our dear heart." "Take away my heart. It's yours." "It's my wish, something only you can fulfill." "It's my wish, something only you can fulfill." "Oh baby, you drive me crazy." "Oh baby, you drive me crazy." "My heart has gone crazy after you." "My heart has gone crazy after you." "All it longs for is to see you, meet you and love you." "All it longs for is to see you, meet you and love you." "It's my wish, something only you can fulfill." "It's my wish, something only you can fulfill." "Oh baby, you drive me crazy." "Oh baby, you drive me crazy." "To tell you the truth.. ..you were love at first sight for me." "To tell you the truth.. ..you were love at first sight for me." "I want you to be my.. ..heartbeat." "All I long for is to be in your arms.. ..in your dreams and your nights." "All I long for is to be in your arms.. ..in your dreams and your nights." "It's my wish, something only you can fulfill." "It's my wish, something only you can fulfill." "Oh baby, you drive me crazy." "Oh baby, you drive me crazy." Raju Bhai. -Yes. Are you counting stars? -Yes. 1,2,3.. Everything is going to be great. Yes. "Boys mumbling." We will remember this. They are at it again. They start wherever they go. They will keep at it. We will have to be strong. That's true. Adi, look there. Even a ghost bathes now? This is scary. Jigga, can you see the ghost there? Ghost. Baby. -Yes. Can you see someone standing there? You.. Please check if you can see a girl. There's no girl here. Ghost. Ghost. Ghost. Baby. Hi Kavita. -Hi. Hey, don't worry. I am alive. Check. -Yes. Jigga, she is alive. -Yes. What happened to you? The thing is that when I went to DK's house.. I don't want this. Keep that in mind. -Sir. Hello sir. You got the money, didn't you? No sir. I came to tell you that.. ..I will give it to you in a few days. Please sir. Please. Alright. I give you a week. I need my money in a week, is that okay? Okay sir. Thank you sir. Let me know of the developments. I think this girl fainted. Take her to the hospital immediately. That's how I reached here. If I get hurt even a little on my head.. ..I faint. Why did you steal the necklace? When I was in college, I met with an accident. And for the operation.. ..my father had taken 5 lakh rupees from DK. After dad passed away, DK's man Kallu Bhai.. ..used to threaten me everyday. So I stole the necklace. Where is the necklace? The necklace is in my pink purse. But when I went to DK's house.. ..the purse was with me. Now I don't know where the purse is. We will have to talk to Charger. I will call him. Go and work there. Keep the pots there. Did you dump the dead body? When will you return the car? Forget all that. Kavita is alive and the necklace is in Simran's house only. Inside DK's house.. ..around DK's room, the necklace is in a pink purse. What are you saying? Thank God Kavita is alive. Listen, come over quickly. -Yes. I am checking on the purse. Come quickly. Yes, we will be there. -Okay bye. Where is it? Where is it? Raju Bhai. Raju Bhai, what are you looking for here? Ah.. -Ah.. Whatever it might be, it will all be great. Popat, put up the canopy quickly. "Phone's ring tone." "Phone's ring tone." Jigga, I looked in the house. I couldn't find the purse. You guys get the car first, then we'll plan something. Charger, no matter what, propose to Simran today. Or you will regret it all your life. I am trying to woo her but I am scared. Will you muster courage once she is married? How do I do it? Get Simran out for dinner at night. Okay, I will do something. Where will you meet me? We will take the car and come near the.. ..village Dhaba (Local restaurant). You get Simran there. We'll handle the rest. Bye. -Bye. I will have to do something. Simran. -Raj. Simran, I want to tell you something. Tell me. Why do you look so sad? Simran, all my friends are planning a meet this evening. Actually, they are partying today so.. ..they have invited you too. But Raj, in the evening.. It isn't possible to get out of the house in the evening. Dad is also home. Please Simran, don't refuse. After tomorrow, I won't get to meet you. Please Simran. But Raj, try and understand. I am getting married tomorrow. How do I get out of home? That too in the evening? It isn't possible. -Simran please. I am asking a little time from you busy life. Please don't refuse. Okay, fine. I will try. Thanks. I will wait for you at the Dhaba near the highway. I have faith that you will definitely turn up. Charger, I don't think Simran will arrive. Even I think so. You fools, Simran will definitely be here. Yes. -You see. Simran. I won't promise you stars and moon. But I will never let darkness seep into your life. Simran, I won't say that I will do anything for you. But if it makes you happy.. ..I will try to do all that is possible. Simran, I won't say that I can't live without you. But if I can't see you in my life ahead.. ..I will keep remembering you. Simran. I won't say that you are the.. ..most beautiful woman in the world. But when I see you.. ..I feel.. ..that no one is more beautiful than you. Simran, I can't promise to love you more than your parents. But I promise, you won't miss them. Simran, maybe our story ends here. But I will pray to God.. ..to make me fall in love with you in every birth. You are the only one. Simran, I love you. I love you so much. And I want to spend my whole life with you. I love you. I love you, Simran. Raj, you have been after me for three years. You follow me and you love me. I never thought about you. Raj, I can't live with you. I love you. Raj, I love you. "That love needed to be expressed in that moment." "And now, I believe." "You are the special one for me." "And now, I believe." "You are the special one for me." I am getting married tomorrow. What do we do? Simran, don't worry. See, what these average engineers do. I am going to get a few women for the.. ..cooking with Bhagu Bhai tomorrow. The plan is.. Stop at the side. Slowly. Raju Bhai, you stay here. I will be right back. Come back quickly. -Yes. I will be right back. Don't leave me and go. -Yes. Bhagu Bhai, you will have to run. Listen, meet me at the turning. Nothing. Making some protein shake for Bhagu Bhai. Yes. Come on now. Three of you sit behind. Come on. Sit properly. Alright, let's go. Bhagu Bhai, drink some water. It's so hot. The water is so calming. That's nice. Stop here. Raju Bhai, halt here. I feel uneasy in my stomach. What? Do you have a tissue paper? I have sand paper. -Sand paper? Hey! Hey! Bhagu Bhai, where are you taking the water? I need water. I will be right back. Be careful of snakes around. Bhagu Bhai. Listen. Listen, your work ends here. But one last thing, do you see the house there? You have to go there. Is that okay? Come on quickly. Go now. Oh God, I feel relaxed. Come on. -Let's go. Come on. Are you done? -Yes. Everything is great in my stomach now. Where are those cooks? They are there. They must have gone to pee. -What? Why are two of them sitting and two standing? How will I know? Okay. They must be guarding. Oh dear. I would have done it in the standing position by now. I loved it in the sitting position too. You had to forget your boxers today only? If that's the case, do it the same way in the hostel too. So even after this, I will have to wear it? What are you doing? If it dampens my clothes, I will beat you up. Beat him up. Raj has to do what not. Exactly. Hey, forget about it. We have gone crazy. Come on, let's go quickly. Yes, let's go. Slowly. We are here. I am driving slow. So, we are here. Raju, you made us reach on time. We will have to freshen up. -What? What did you say? -They meant fresh. They meant brushing. -You know everything, right? Hey. I mean, we need to pee. -Hey. He has a sore throat it seems. Raju Bhai, do one thing. Get them inside and show them the work. About the cooking. There is a lot of pending work. Everything is going to be great. Oh God. A lot of work is left. -Yes. I will have to do everything. Come here. What have you made me wear? I can't even breathe. Are you out of your mind? Listen. Do you see that? Go there. Put on the veil. Please wear this sari. -Yes. Put on the veil. Go on, now. Mansukh Bhai, do this properly. Do it properly. Why is it so less? Oh dear. Where are you heading? -We are going to light up the house. We don't need lights there. Who will light up the stage? Go and do it. Listen, don't put up red and yellow lights. Do you get it? Do it. Wait a second. Show it to me. Whose purse is this? Is it not yours? Where did you find it? It's my purse. It's mine. Come on, get on with your work. Listen. Show that. Thank you. Go on. What is this? What are we even wearing? I got a pink purse. This is my purse. Check if it has the necklace. Wow, we found the necklace. Go and give this to DK right away. So we are out of this mess. -Yes. What are you saying? If I give it to him, he will throw me out right away. -Right. We'll see what needs to be done. Listen. Look here. We will see about the necklace later. What's.. ..more important is stopping Simran's wedding. Anyhow. -Yes. Raju Bhai. Raju Bhai, all of you are chatting here? We have called you here to work. I was telling them the same thing. -Why are they standing? Sister. Who is this? Shameless fellow. How dare you! Will you sit on our heads? -Hey. No, we are just saying. Don't you have a woman in your life? -I do. You are such a moron! You fool! Please don't insult me like that! Raju Bhai, tell them what they ought to do. The temperature is rising. Leave. -Yes, I am leaving. Stupid. Fool. Ruffian. -Hey. Are you out of your mind? Look at him. He will get me in trouble. You got wafers here? Do you want to eat it? -No, I don't. You have to work, you remember right? Some more work now? We have already worn sari for you. We have turned into women. And you want us to work too? You are talking as if I have asked you all to have children. Can't happen. -You will have to do it, lazy boy. You have got powder, haven't you? Charger, don't worry. We have arranged for everything. You all know the plan, right? You hide yourself here. I have to give the necklace, get ready. I have a lot of work. Hide yourself. I will.. Oh dear. Do you want to eat it? No, I don't. Simran, I can't find your waist-chain. I will get it. Raj, do you know? My grandmother had said before she passed away.. ..that my husband will make me wear this necklace. As grandma said.. ..I am your husband now. Raj, Jaan will be here in some time. Raj, please do something. I can't live without you. Raj, please do something. I am there with you. Don't worry. Raj and Simran will always be together. Always and forever. No matter what happens, you won't get married today. Simran, what is all this? Mom, I don't want to get married. Dear, what are you saying? If your dad gets to know.. ..he will kill you. I will die but won't get married to Vikram. Greetings. I am not here to run away with Simran. I will not to anything.. ..that will tarnish your family's image. But I won't let your dear daughter get married. To tell you the truth. Even I don't like Vikram. I am with both of you.
