Bella, how many people do you owe money to? Three. How much? Fuck. What are we gonna do now? What happened to your arm? Just a sec. Maricar, we got into a fight. I killed someone. What? Who? Ray. I stabbed him. Are you sure he's dead? Yeah. Because I stabbed him in the chest. What's your plan? They might follow you here. No, only Bogs knows about this place.

Just don't tell anyone I'm here. Okay, what else? Let me stay here... Maybe three days. You have food? Yeah. What else can I do for you? Oh right, you're hurt. It's nothing. Does this mean I can get a motor... What? When you get your territory back, because that's where you lift motorcycles, right? I don't know, I'm just trying to lie low for now. You wanna take a bath first? You go first. Sure? Yeah. Okay. 50 thousand if you tell us where Pepe is. Why would I do that? He pays for my rent. How much? 15 thousand a month plus he gives me an allowance. You tell us where he is and we'll give you 500 thousand, and cover your rent. And I want a motorcycle. You can have mine. We're going to find him anyway, and then you'll get nothing. 242 Ashcroft Ln, Apartment 2B. Hurry, he's almost done bathing. Your turn to wash up. We're near. Where is he? I don't know!

Thank you. Yes, sir? Ray got killed earlier in a gang war. Find out who is responsible. Yes, right away sir. Head to the scene now. Okay, thank you sir. They were childhood friends. One went into crime and one went into law enforcement. Something like that. Jojo, were you here when it happened? We won't have trouble with the evidence. You really won't help us? You know, it's simple. If you don't tell me what you know now, I could bring in your whole gang for questioning. Doesn't matter to me how much Lito pays my boss. We're looking for the same guy. Pepe. There's a huge bounty on him. He has no escape. Last night, our undercover officer Mark Serrano, known as Ray, was killed. He was stabbed by Pepe Camacho, and we've already issued a warrant of arrest against him. That's why I want you to setup barrages and check points all over the city, including all highway tolls. Ma'am, do you know him, or have you seen him? No, sorry. Have you seen Pepe Camacho? Oh, no sorry. There is a 500 thousand cash reward to anyone who provides information leading to his capture. 500 thousand reward? Yes, half a million pesos. When you see him, please call our office. Please let the authorities know if you see him. You better get moving fast so we can find out where he's hiding. Clear? - Yes sir! - Now get out of here. Excuse me. Hi miss. Hello. Can we talk to you for a sec? We just wanna ask you something. Oh sure, what is it? We're looking for someone. You might know him. Hmm, yes, that's Pepe. I know him, but he hasn't been here in a bit. Someone told us he's often here. If you find out anything about this guy... Just call me. Anytime you want. Sure. Thank you. You're new, huh? Yes, why? You also work at Diamonds, right? Yeah, you can find me in a few other places. You know him? Oh, that's Pepe. I always see him around. When was the last time you saw him? A few weeks ago. Haven't seen him since? Or heard anything from the girls about him? No. Why? You have a problem? Where can I find him? Oh, you should ask his girlfriend. Oh, you're back to working. Yeah, well, I can't quit now, can I? There might be a way. You're still a troublemaker. And you... And you're still beautiful. Thanks. So, three days? Three days. Might be longer. Here. I got your favorite biscuits. My favorite? You're so cute. Bella, hold on... I have one rule... No cellphones, I'm keeping this later. Then what are we gonna do to stay busy? Get on. Hold on tight, okay? Let's go... Bella... - where are we going? - Just follow me. This is it? Be careful. Let me. Bella, your phone? Here. Is there another one? I only have one. Let me check, okay. Clean? I'm not sure. Who bandaged your arm? It's like they rushed through it. They did a terrible job. Where are you going? Bella... How have things been? Allie's almost due. That was fast. How's TJ? He's good. He wants to be a firefighter. He's always playing. He goes around the apartment all day putting out fake fires. Such a cute kid. Just like his father. How's work? Are you still working for that networking company? Not anymore. Why? Remember that investment scheme I told you about? The one I told you not to do? Fuck, it was a scam. I'm in a huge debt because of that. I need to pay them back or else, the lenders are gonna come after me. How much do you owe? A lot. To serious people. This is all good, thank you. So, how much? Give me their numbers. I'll settle it. They're not going to be intimidated. They're all well connected. I'll talk to them. I'll find a way. How? You have the cash? No, I'll talk to them. Let's make a list of their names. Can you get some paper? And list their contacts and how much you owe them. Let me handle this, don't worry about it anymore. Okay? Can I depend on you? Can I trust you? Of course. I really missed you. Babe. Babe. Babe. - What? - What is it? It's late. I'm still waiting for a call. From who? Why? Come here... I need to catch Pepe so that I can get a promotion and a salary raise... Then we can buy our dream house and car. I know that, babe... I just worry about what it's gonna take. I don't want you to get too angry that you make a mistake and go overboard. Because you and Ray were close as kids. It's not just that. What? I was the one who convinced him to go undercover for this operation. I know that, babe, but you're good at what you do. You'll find the guy. You know what, don't worry, okay? Just relax. Babe... Just take your anger out on me. Do you think he's with any of his family? Could be, but they're all in Zamboanga now. Any other friends I don't know about? Bogs would know better than me, he's his best friend. Any ex-girlfriends? I deleted all the ex's numbers on his phone. Does he have any mistresses? No, but there was one name that would keep popping up when I check his phone. Who's that? B something. Bia... Bea... Bella? Do you know where she stays? No, but he would get very protective of her. And he'd always send her money. Hello? Do you know a Bella? Yeah, Pepe's ex from years ago. Where does she live? She lived with her sister, somewhere in Barangay Dela Paz Sur. Okay. Miss, miss, do you know a girl named Bella around here? No, sorry. Miss, miss, do you know a Bella who lives around here? Nope. Can I ask if you know a Bella who lives near here? Bella? No. Who is she anyway? Try looking in that alley over there. Bella... Careful. Bella... Are you Bella? She's my sister, my half sister. Do you know where she is? Why? Are you her friend? Where is she? She left yesterday and hasn't answered my texts since. Then call her. Is that her only phone number? Yeah, you can check my phone if you want. Congratulations on the new baby. Your sister is hiding a guy with a huge bounty on his head. If you give him up, you can get rich. How much is the reward? 500 thousand from me, same from the police. So if your sister's smart, she'll tell us where he is and collect double. What's your number? I'm Jojo. Tell her to text me the address. I can't believe you still do puzzles. I love them. Plus, we have so much time to kill here. You still haven't changed. You're exactly the same as when we first met. It's a shame... it didn't work out. We were too young. I think we're a better fit now. You know I don't dance. But you're so cute when you do. You're more mature now. Yes, very. But still getting yourself in trouble. That's not gonna change. No matter what, are you going to have my back? Yes of course, you can stay here as long as you want. With Allie and TJ. About your debts don't even worry about it anymore. Promise I'll take care of it. I love you. I love you too. Pepe is wanted by the police and rival gang. You're in danger, sis. I'm outside. Meet me. Can we meet? Babe, I need to go. I'll be a little while. Alright, take care. You'll be okay here? Alright. I won't take long. Lito... Pepe... What the fuck happened? I said no weapons. Yeah, I didn't have any! Ray was the one who took out the blade. Lito, you know me. You didn't kill just anyone, Pepe. That was Jojo's second in command. You have to pay up or you have to go. In the old days, we used to respect each other. That's how we started. Now we just put our hands in each other's pocket. Those were the old days, Pepe. That's in the past. Put that in your little brain. Give me another chance to form a truce. It's not going to change anything, Pepe. They're out for blood and I can't let this pass. So that's it? Fine. Jojo put out a bounty. You're worth 500 thousand. If they find you, they won't turn you in alive. Fine... This guy Jojo came to our place. He said his gang and the police are after Pepe. He said if we give him up, he'll give us 500 thousand, and the police will do the same. We can't do that, Allie. He was so scary, Bella. He didn't even hesitate to take his gun out in front of TJ. Did TJ see the gun? Yeah. Bella, they know who we are and where we live. You have to decide if we're gonna give Pepe up, or if TJ and I also have to go into hiding. But they're still gonna find us, Bella. I saw it on the news too, the entire police force is after him. I don't wanna lose his trust, I promised I'd keep him safe. They're gonna catch him soon. Either we take this opportunity now, or we get nothing. At least this way, we can pay off your debt and our lives won't be in danger. - Are you Pepe? - Yeah. - You're Jake? - Yes. Bella owes you money? Yeah, a lot. What's this? Take it. Is this original? Go find out at the pawnshop. What's this? It's not enough. Not enough? Yeah, she owes me much more than this. You can have my motorcycle outside. Are we good? Okay. We're even. Tell the others they'll get theirs soon. Okay, will do. My boy... Papa... I just want you to know that I love you so, so much. Okay? Yes, pa. Come here, I love you my boy. Yes, pa. I love you. You talked to Bella? Yeah. That was fast. This is how it's going to work. You give me the money up front, right now, and I'll tell you where he is. If you fuck it up, that's on you, but you're paying for the information. I'll kill you if you don't tell me where he is. Remember my sister, Bella? Yeah. She's at a police station right now. I told her that if you didn't pay me within 15 minutes, she'll tell the police you murdered me. I sent her a photo of you and everything. It's just five minutes away from here. Surround the house, he'll arrive anytime now. Hurry! Sorry you are late, TJ. - Take care. - Yes, ma. Good luck, baby. Bye, ma. Go and play. Are you gonna tell him? Tell him what? That I'm the reason his father's dead? Here's our payment. They just left. Here. Our payment, thanks.
