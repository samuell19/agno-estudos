Late '70s, we're talking '78, '79, I'm seeing a news report about the blossoming computer hobby market. And they said something like 500 people in the UK that year would build their own home computer. And by that, I mean a Nascom, a Compukit. MK-14s was another one. For British people, the advent of the early home computers was perfect. And why we were so dominant in the world is because the British have got this crazy creativity going on. And home computers at that time were perfect. It was all about invention. It was all about creating things that would never have existed before. And also, the British interest in Heath Robinson solutions. I think there's something that the Brits love about trying to get something working, even if it's not particularly elegant. Just the fact that you've got it working. You've cobbled something together, "It works, that'll do. "Thank you very much. What's the next problem to solve?" I think we're very good at doing that kind of stuff. Home computing was a hobby within itself. And a lot of the people who came into it came into it from amateur radio. So they were connecting it for teletypes and all that sort of stuff. And they were more interested in putting a relay board on than playing a game. MIKE AUSTIN: These early computers had lots of separate components. Integrated circuits, resistors, capacitors, everything. All of that had to be assembled by hand and separately soldered in. Thousands of joints, big ribbon cables, all this kind of stuff. It was a very complicated task, and quite hard to make sure that you actually ended up with a working computer at the end of it. The first home computer in Britain was something called the Nascom 1. And when the Nascom 1 was announced, they did a road show around Britain, and they were all talking about, you know, how you would solder this kit together with 1,200 joints. And then, almost as an afterthought, they said, "Well, what can you do with it?" And somebody did a little presentation, not long, saying, "Well, you can actually play games with computers." It was the development that was going on in the computers that were starting to be offered to the public. That the ZX80 was a serious assault for the consumers. EVERISS: It was the invention of the microprocessor that did it. You know, Intel made the 4040 and then the 8080, then Zilog made the Z80 and then the 6502 came along. And, you know, it was impossible until those devices existed. Once those devices existed, once those microprocessors, once that silicon was available cheaply, then that allowed it all to happen. For the UK, it was the ZX80, and it's almost like a proof of concept. Here's a technology that works. We can make a small, cheap computer that people can get a kit for, put it together, and they can do proper computing at home. The idea of having your own machine at home was so fantastic to me. I would have done anything to get a hold of a ZX80. I saved up, I worked cleaning bogs in offices for months to save up the money to get the ZX80 and I ordered it. Clive Sinclair mail order always took a long time. My ZX80 arrived on the same day as my A Level results. It was fantastic. But it was a little bit flaky in places. It was almost impossible to get a moving picture on the screen 'cause every time your program ran, the screen kind of went to a grey. EYLES: I remember the display kind of blinking off and on the whole time. It was great for hobbyists, but not for, kind of, everyone to use particularly. Unless you enjoyed that, kind of, getting right down to the metal. The ZX81 comes out at £70, which was amazing. It sold in much larger quantities than the ZX80. It was a bit more robust, a bit more nicely finished. And that was really the key machine which created the whole, kind of, bedroom coder. And I think the ZX81 actually sparked it all off. ZX81 was actually quite magical. For the first time, you had this case with, yes, its rubbish keyboard that you just needed to keep trying to push to make anything happen. Every time you pushed it, the RAM pack would wobble and you'd crash and everything. But being able to take that very simple bit of electronic kit and use it to create something on the TV, that was completely mind-blowing. 'Cause you, actually as a kid, that's all you had as an entertainment medium, pretty much, growing up, was the TV, and being able to control that box and do something yourself, create something that threw images up there, that was really special. And that was, I think, what engaged me so much as well. You wanted to do something, you wanted to see what else it could do. And I think that's where the whole nebulous of the British industry comes from. It was about kids that were playing and wanting to change something, experiment, do something. That led into everything else. STEVE TURNER: Homemade games really started with the ZX81. Suddenly people could write moving games on a cheap computer. JON RITMAN: The Sinclair book that came with the ZX81 was excellent and superbly written. I doubt if I'd have ever got where I did get to without that. It was so informative and so simply put together. I supposed the book told you so much and then you could extrapolate and do a little bit more. And, you know, you start doing nested loops and things like that, and first thing you do is the submarine game. And you soon move on from the "Hello Mum" printing, and it just seems to be full of possibilities. It was like magic just taking over the screen. Because you could control what was gonna be on the TV screen, rather than watch it. You could put commands in and make it do whatever you wanted. I'd play around with it. You couldn't do much, 1K RAM. I remember typing a maze because it had alphanumeric on the keys. So there was two-by-two, black and white, picture on each key. And so I remember typing a maze into the command line, you could just go across. Top line, second line, third line, typing a maze, making it up as I go along. And then I've pretty much filled the screen and then it said, "Out of memory." The ZX81 came with the BASIC programming language, which was very rudimentary. There was no memory on it. There was 1K of memory, which, to put it into perspective, the Twitter icon on your mobile phone is probably about 8K. So that gives you an idea of how much memory was in there. But, you know, I managed to get a few very simple things working, like, you know, getting the letter "A" to fly across the screen and things like that, which, for me, was a great achievement. No one else understood what I was doing or why I was doing it, but it was a lot of fun. We managed to persuade the head teacher to lend us the keys to the school. She was gobsmacked that kids were wanting to come into school and work more. (CHUCKLING) But, you know, we didn't see it as work. So we'd come in at 8:00, half past 7:00, just to get time on the computers. And then during lunch breaks, and then after school as well, stay late. I didn't even know what programming was. When you start and you realise, "I can take control of this." Or, "I could make it do whatever you wanted." And around me I see all these people playing games. And the games were incredibly basic. I mean, games back in those days, you were the letter "A" or you're a star or something like that. Like, you had to have an imagination to play games back then, let's put it that way. But you could see how captivating it was. And if you look back at some of those very early games, like 3D Monster Maze for example. You know, which is extraordinary. It was the first first-person game where you run away from a tyrannosaurus which chases you around a ZX81 maze. It was just to learn how to program. So the first thing I did was to work out an algorithm for creating a maze. And then I thought, "I wonder what this would look like in 3D." And, "Could I get the graphics on the ZX81 to look like a 3D maze?" And that's what I did do. Good evening. I'd like to welcome you all to The Hobby Computer Club. I notice there are a number of faces here that we haven't seen before. It was a hobbyist thing in those days. There was CB radios and computers, all these sort of basic electronics and stuff, and very much a hobby. I mean, people weren't in the business for making money. It was just to become a better programmer, really. MACLEAN: And there was a computer club 'cause I joined it. It was called the ACC, the Amateur Computer Club. And I was like member 200 or something. And, yeah, it was full of middle-aged, weirdy-beardy types. And another chap whose name escapes me... It was a solicitor with one hand, I remember that. And he had a TI-99. And I went around to his house many times, and we would sit there writing bizarre, simple games on this TI-99, which had colour graphics. Wow (LAUGHING) It was just out of general interest. I had obviously... I enjoyed playing video games. I thought it would be nice to maybe create some very simple games, just for myself. And I understood that I would have to learn how to program. So that was also very interesting. The only way to really learn how to program back then was to type programs into the computer. I got the bug straight away. I was just constantly looking for programs to type in, and tinkering with things, and just wanted to make games. Just loved it. We used to get these magazines, kind of hobbyist magazines basically with a few basic listings in and things like that. You saw these listings and you got an idea, "God, I could write one of those listings. "I've got to get one of these home computers. "I've got to start typing in and programming." The type-in listings were the main selling point of the magazine, initially. You got a full program that you could type in. And you'd have a working game for the cost of the magazine. I don't know. We probably had about 10, 15 games a month in the magazine. So, I mean, a good sort of... Probably 60%, 70% of the magazine was code. Pages and pages of code that people would type in. You have to remember that in those days, you couldn't go into a high street or go online and just buy a game. You had to send off for it. So typing it in was a good way to go. Your Computer. We used to call it "Your Hex Dump." I remember some of the listings in there, once we started to do Assembler, were massive. CECCO: Huge blocks of hexadecimal numbers, which you assumed would just work. And you would just sit there and type them in. My own outlet was to look at listings in magazines, and I didn't even have a tape recorder to be really honest with you. So we just had to hope the power never went and just started typing. And we probably finished about 4:00 in the morning. And it'd be riddled, you'd be going back checking line by line. It'd become almost obsessive compulsive behaviour, I think, to actually make it work. You just saw pages and pages of data. You looked at it, it was Double Dutch, but you thought, "I've got to have a go at this." It was compelling. The anticipation of the thing at the end of it was something really quite special. You're taking the words, the numbers, these magic symbols, you're creating a spell, an incantation, and whoa, this thing happens. Something would come up on the screen and it all made sense. "Oh, this part is making the characters move on the screen, "this part is bringing the colour in and flashing it." And so that then fed the thirst to learn even more. Often, there were bugs in the listings as they were printed out, and you couldn't necessarily slavishly go through and make sure you got every character right, and then have a working game. So you'd have to debug somebody else's listing. Trying to get them to work, and working out how they were working. Not just doing it blindly, "Oh, yes, that's what it does." But, "Oh, yeah, if you do that and then that, this is what happens." I could see it at the end. There was a result at the end, I could see it. And it was fascinating. I was captured. We would modify the listings, you'd modify them and do things with them. You'd start just by maybe changing a few sprites or... You start messing with the rules and then you start adding to the rules. And that in itself is a fantastic, liberating craft to suddenly pursue. I'd type that listing in. "Hey, that's a bit of fun. Let's see if we can improve it. "Let's see if we can write Pac-Man." That was a bit tough. (LAUGHING) It was, with 1K memory. I wouldn't have become a programmer had it not been for magazine listings and illustrations and techniques. They really were the Internet of the day. And that was our cycle, you know. Hopefully, someone cool would send something into a magazine, hopefully it'd get printed the next month, then we'd see it, then we'd interact. You know, reader's letters into the editors. So our feedback loop was like two or three months. Now a blog goes up same day, comment same day. Next day you're onto something new. Which is why we've had so much progress lately. But that was our Internet. It's amazing the number of people that I still meet of my generation who aren't programmers at all, they've, you know, gone on and done completely different things. But they still remember typing in basic listings when they were 14. And they still have an understanding of the code goes, things like, "If this, then that, then..." It's an understanding. "Oh, yeah, 10 print Ben is great. 20 go to 10. Oh, yeah!" And that very basic understanding of, kind of, how the thing works, and that it was just a simple box that you'd type things into, and it did what you wanted. That attitude, I think that's what spawned the originality. Because it was lots and lots of different people all doing different things. One of the most exciting things you could do was type, poke a number into the screen memory and actually see dots appear. To us, the idea of being able to actually control the television was just unbelievably exciting. I can remember getting The Acorn Atom and getting a pixel to move off screen and, you know. Yeah. It was as close to sexual satisfaction as you can possibly get. The interesting thing about that time was that you couldn't get very many games. So if you wanted to play a particular game, the best way was to write it yourself. We didn't have enough money to go and buy games. There weren't very good games and stuff, so you'd just do it yourself. And we'd sort of please ourselves that we were doing it. You would be sitting there thinking, you know, "I know it looks like the letter 'V' but it's not really. "It's like an asteroid ship or..." And you would basically look at what you've got available to you and try to imagine what that could become. You'd write a routine. You'd write a particularly nice routine to do some scrolling or some parallax stuff or whatever it was. And then, I don't know, look around for a plot, grab a science fiction book or something and just plug in as many things as you could find and that you could just think of. And then you would start developing around that. And the games, to be honest, started out very simple. I remember making games like Zombies, where wherever you stand zombies approach you and you just try to get them to fall in holes, right? When you're trying to learn how to program, it's the kind of thing that's actually very good. What was nice is at that stage you didn't need advanced graphics, you didn't need artwork, you didn't need very much marketing. It was enough to produce a spacecraft out of ASCII symbols, which meant you could concentrate on gameplay and you didn't have to worry too much about the peripherals. It was heady. It was at the crazy world of super high-power processors and masses of K of memory. You know, in the early days there was absolutely no thought that I can make a single cent of money out of what I was doing. In fact, it was insanely destructive for my life. You know, I didn't have a girlfriend, I didn't really have any friends. All my spare time I spent sitting in front of my home computer, smoking cigarettes, drinking cans of Coke and eating pizzas. So, you know, I think at work I got the nickname of "Thunder Thighs" because, you know, I had put on so much weight from inactivity of a type. But I didn't think I could make any money out of this. I mean, you don't make money out of things that are fun to do, the things that you enjoy doing. That's not what making money is all about. That's what I thought back then. There was no thought at that point that it would ever be a business. It was just part of the stuff which we did as nerds. We thought this was a little nerdy hobby that nobody else in the world would ever really be interested in. And it was only when ZX80 came out, you started to get an idea that maybe more people would get into this. And then the ZX81 came out and it started to really take off. We used to do it at school in libraries. Sort of sneak off lessons and go and play on the library machines, they had BBCs and MZ8Ks. And the library teachers realised that people kept going in often. So they thought, "Well, we can start producing software to sell to other schools." So, actually, I was in the business really early. So, we were actually producing games, not games, but educational software at the time. And then they were sold to the other schools, and then every so often they'd treat us by taking us out for lunch. So it was brilliant. I suppose it felt, and probably was, extremely amateurish, but in a good way. People were making games, but principally, the games that got everyone's attention were the games in the arcades. The big thing was the arrival of the different various Pac-Man machines and Space Invaders in the arcade. They changed everything. You know, you could kind of buy the cheap £20 equivalence of that. It was just a lot of flashing LED lights. And you know, you believed in it. You know, you just wanted to make it real. So when real cabinets came along, it was the game changer, I think. Well, the arcades were very popular. Pretty much, you'd go hang out with your friends at the arcade in the late '70s. And playing games were a part of that. But it was really just a place to get together as well. Once the arcades started popping up, it was to go, to compete, to follow the crowds. That's where everyone seemed to be going. You'd find kids in there, whether they should be or otherwise, playing these things. And I think the beginnings of the business in the UK, or in fact Europe, was arcade driven. And this was the first time you had a new reality being projected onto a screen that you had some kind of control over. And that for me was very, very moving. JULIAN RIGNALL: Space Invaders. I remember seeing that for the first time. I was a little bit far back from the machine and I was looking at this screen with these space invaders on it. I could see this guy playing it, and my first thought was like, "How the hell is he controlling all of those things with just those buttons?" And then I looked in and saw that that thing at the bottom of the screen was firing and it really was like, "Holy crap! That is just so awesome." The arcades had to be a grand experience. You were paying money for it, every play. It had to be the best possible hardware and the best possible software. These arcade machines were something that had never been seen before. And they were colourful, they had thumping soundtracks, thumping sound effects. So when home computers came out, because I had seen and played on these arcade machines and I was fascinated by them, I think it was probably just natural that I wanted to have one of these things and actually try and duplicate what these arcade machines were doing. Now, it was an impossible task to do it well, of course, because arcade hardware was so much more advanced than home hardware. But, you know, it was a challenge. Many of the games were either blatant copies of things in the arcade. I mean really blatant. It was hard to tell them apart, sound effects and everything. To games that were clearly very closely following them. The number of Frogger clones that you could see for any format, Hopper, Froggie, all this kind of stuff. There was all clones and iterations of every type of Space Invader, particularly, and every type of little scrolling character with the same bleeps and the same whistles. There were a few of us who realised that they were just games. You couldn't get a good version of Defender so maybe we could do a better version. We were doing it for our own amusement. I remember a version of Centipede that was in the arcades. We'd gone into an arcade, seen a version of the centipede which was coming down, avoiding mushrooms and stuff and we spent the next week trying to recreate it on Dragon, and did a fairly good job of it. KENWRIGHT: So it allowed you to create these early copycat games and play with them, expand them, develop them and take them to the next level. The arcades were there and were attracting an audience. But the game changer was the Sinclair Spectrum computer. That was the first computer that really created a mass platform in the UK. And despite that funny little rubber keyboard, people started writing games and making money and there was a whole market that quickly opened up. I think the Spectrum was probably the most important thing that happened to video games in this country. I think it's probably the most important thing that happened to programming in this country. I'm not going to underplay the significance of the Commodore 64. It was very relevant. But we had Sir Clive. KENWRIGHT: You've got to thank Clive Sinclair for what he did for the games industry. You've got to appreciate, we've never seen the likes of it before. It was Sir Clive Sinclair. I don't think he got knighted because of that little electric car thing that he came up with. This was because of the Spectrum. A lot of things came together with the Spectrum. Sinclair did a great job with the distribution. You could get it everywhere, everyone had one. If it wasn't for Sir Clive Sinclair looking at what computers could be and understanding that they had to be affordable, we would not have the industry we all grew up to because for £100 or whatever you could have a computer in your home. The release of the Sinclair Spectrum was the major event of the British games industry at the time. It was the first computer, I think, that was both accessible in terms of price to people like me, and could actually be a platform for relatively sophisticated games because you actually had a huge amount of memory on the 48K model. 40K you could use for your program and data. This was amazing. It was cheap and it was powerful and you could do a lot with it. When I saw the ads for the Spectrum I thought, "Right, I'm gonna get one of the first Spectrums. "I'm gonna disassemble that, find out how it works "and be one of the first to do it." So I was determined to be one of the pioneers. When the Spectrum came out, all of a sudden you had colour, you had sound. I mean, it wasn't brilliant sound, but you still had sound and you had high resolution pixels. So you could actually get a sprite to look like what it should do rather than the big massive pixels. And most importantly, it had the reliable tape load in. That opened up some huge avenues for me, so I could now write programs and save them. It was an interesting time because before that, people like me, who were really lame artists could totally stay undercover. I just had to do simple little blobs and things so I was good to go. But the Spectrum is where it started to go... Where you could plot every dot and I could see, "Wow, your graphics are just terrible, David." It was a moment where I realised, "I'm gonna need help here. "I'm not gonna be able to get away with this much longer. "I need to get some art help." That was the moment, I think, when teams formed. Like suddenly there was the concept of, "We have to have a team here." 48K to write a game? These days a program could use up 48K in 10 minutes. Just one line of code. So you had to write the whole thing and you had to get up to all sorts of tricks. And that's where the Spectrum games, particularly I think, got better and better, more and more sophisticated, as the programmers learnt more and more tricks to do it. AHMAD: There are still so many programmers from that era who benefited from the lack of restraints in that original Spectrum 48K design in my opinion. I think, the thing about the American hardware was that it was designed around constraints. You had a number of sprites, you had a number of colours. You had display list interrupts. You had all this hardware stuff, right? But the Spectrum was just RAM, processor, screen, off you go. And to begin with there was not really any sound. And that for me just completely lifted the lid off the creativity of British programmers. I remember when they first announced it. We thought, "48K, that's beyond the dreams of avarice. "How are you ever gonna fill that memory?" But people did. And that high memory bar allowed the likes of Ultimate Play the Game, Imagine, many, many other publishers and developers to create some of the most creative games the world has ever seen. What Clive Sinclair said is that every home was going to have a computer. That entertainment on computers, with the computer games, would be a huge, major entertainment force. Now, he was laughed at, almost. But that stuck with me, because I thought, already you could see the, kind of, Moore's Law of doubling of speed and halving of price starting to come in now. And my imagination was saying, "One day this thing is going to be pretty powerful." So it was a real feeling of this was the start of something that was going to be big. It just captured the imagination of every kid in the country, I think. And it was really a UK phenomenon. I think someone said at one stage there was probably 100,000 developers, teenage bedroom developers, that were working on the ZX. And I think that was the one, that was the catalyst that opened the doors. And I think firmly set the precedence for what was to arrive in the next few years. The Spectrum definitely had a major impact on Britain, which was then boosted by the BBC machines, and of the endorsement by the BBC, as a corporation, with their TV programmes... What happens next? Well, we have to load the program into the machine. So you type, "Load." L-O-A-D? ...to learn about computers and buy one. The amazing BBC Micro. I mean, it was an incredible machine. REPORTER: The government hopes to have a computer in every secondary school by the end of the year. And last month a further £9 million was allocated to extend the scheme to the primary schools. And judging by the pupils' response, computers are in school for good. INTERVIEWER: How would you describe the children's reaction to computers? Well, in the main, they're very, very enthusiastic about computers. As you've seen for yourselves, the computer club is usually swamped by the very young children. Our school only got BBC Micros just after I left, which was really annoying. (LAUGHING) But, having said that, they got them and they were really popular. Because one of the beauties of the BBC Micro is you could deploy a piece of software to every machine in the classroom with a single command. That is really, really powerful. Just script-driven, very, very simple. I think it was extremely empowering, because previous computers were actually very difficult to program. They were almost impenetrable. And the BBC, with its very advanced BASIC and the ability to mix Assembler and BASIC in the same program, literally, your code could be written in BASIC first and then you could take bits of it and write Assembler to speed it up and make it run better. And then more and more of it would be in Assembler until, eventually, everything was in Assembler. So it was a fantastic way to learn programming and to write really good code. And we were so enthusiastic about programming and computers and stuff, we just had to get our hands on a BBC Model B. It seemed like the best one. I quite fancied having a good one rather than starting a bit lower down at a cheaper level. I wanted to have something that I could do something with. GEOFF CRAMMOND: Everything about it just seemed to me to be better. So that was quite easy to start creating programs for that. But it also had built-in graphics, which meant you could very easily produce images and then move them around. Then I started moving things on the screen really quickly. And that, in itself, was quite an addictive process. When you have success, it spurs you on. So I was quite happy then to get stuck in and try and produce something a bit more challenging. The BBC B was a very nice, elegant platform. The way they designed it was very straightforward, very logical. It has a very, kind of, almost philosophical cleanliness to it. Very well thought out, by people that, obviously, loved programming and wanted to support programming. And that's kind of what the BBC B was about. It was about, um... It was made by programmers. Plus, it had the best games. (LAUGHING) The VIC-20 was a very credible platform. But it was just about to be overtaken by Commodore 64. And that was such a better piece of kit. # Are you keeping up with the Commodore? # 'Cause the Commodore is keeping up with you # In a world of fun and fantasy and ever changing views # And computer terminology # Commodore is news # ROB HUBBARD: Commodore had just come out and that was advertised as having a lot of memory, it had a sound chip and I thought, "Well, that looks a bit more interesting than these other machines." So that's what I decided to get. MINTER: The Commodore 64 was just so much more tempting because it had that wonderful sound chip in it, it had hardware sprites, and all the stuff that made your life as a game programmer much easier. It had dedicated graphics, dedicated sound, great processor, sensible interrupt structure, loved it. MARK JONES: The scrolling, the way everything moved around the screen was a lot more smoother. And also, you could have more than two colours per character square. But you did have these little bit blocky graphics that made it look a bit rubbish. HEALEY: The Spectrum owners, obviously, always used to mock how the Commodore 64's graphics were much chunkier because in multi-colour mode the pixels were twice as wide as they were high. But then programmers started doing tricks by using the hardware sprites. You could put hi-res mono-coloured sprites on top of other ones to get multi-colour ones and all... I could go into that. Yes. Oh, God. I'm going all nostalgic and dreamy-eyed now. There was a very booming Commodore 64 tech thing where people would somehow put sprites in the border. Sprites in the border was done by utilising a timing bug, basically, in the graphics chip. The people that built the Commodore weren't aware of the fact that it was possible to do this, that you could stretch the whole screen to the width of the TV. So that's the kind of thing that was found by hacking, rather than nicely programming the thing, or, as you say, following the manual. It's exploring and hacking it, and seeing how we could... I don't want to say the word, but mess it up, you know. It wasn't just a case of writing another game. It's how much could you squeeze out of this processor. We're looking at an 8-bit machine at 0.7 Megahertz and 64K of RAM. And we made that thing sing and it would dance, doing stuff that even Commodore, the manufacturers, just couldn't believe. The SID chip, as we all know, is the heart of the Commodore 64. Who cares about the other stuff? I think the SID chip allowed the Commodore 64 to become an instrument in its own right. And so now, the sound wasn't just primitive beeps. There were proper soundtracks that were really... You wanted to listen to them. You'd want to find out who had written the music to the latest game, and that would be a reason to buy it. The Commodore 64 came along with three voices synthesised and it was, it was completely... It was a cheap synthesiser, as far as I was concerned. And I could compose for it, it was marvellous. It had pulse-width and ring modulation. Things you'd expect on an actual commercial synthesiser, like a Moog or something. And it gave you so much power, it was unbelievable. And it took me a while to get used to all the features on the SID chips 'cause it's a very sophisticated piece of hardware. Well, there were certain things on the SID chip that you could do like the hard sync and the ring modulation, which is something that I knew about because I had worked with synths. There were a few other things that you could do that weren't documented and you would just set a couple of bits and get a strange new wave form coming from it. And then I expanded it to try to use it musically, which... That was quite a challenge because with it being a non-maskable interrupt there was only certain, you know... A short range you could do with it to change the actual pitch of what you were getting out of it. I had, sort of, developed this technique for making it sound like the Commodore was playing more than three notes at once, by taking one of the oscillators and going around the notes I wanted to play in a cycle, very quickly, like very fast arpeggio. Because I was into Jean Michel Jarre and all these other synthesiser acts. And one of the tricks I used was arpeggios or arpeggiators all the time to play all these cycles of notes and that sounded really cool to me. So I made the Commodore do it really quickly. And when you go really quickly, it sounded like all of the notes were being played at once. Except there was kind of a wibbly-wobbly crazy weirdness to the sound. Everybody had their own little driver routines that would do... Have various ways of doing interesting effects and things. And yes, that's when it became really fun, was pushing the chip further than it would go, as it were. We were about make a very simple machine look fabulous, sound fabulous, suck people in. And I think, going back to what you said about, "Why are people so in love with Commodore 64 music?" It's because they were sucked in and that's what we did. We sucked people into a world that was really little square blocks and very crude sound, really. I remember the mood in the UK in those days vividly because, to me, the computer games industry and the feel, they were the ripples that started, I suppose, with the punk era. And this feeling of youth and the possibility of youth had carried on, the ripples just kept on moving out. By the early '80s, there did seem to be an opportunity that if you had an idea, you could actually do something about it. We were in a position in the UK where we were ready for something to happen. We had the creative mentality. We had the keenness in electronics. We had the home computers, some of which were being made and created here. So we very much had all the ingredients of belief. So you had this feeling that we were gonna go out and we were gonna make things happen. And there was thousands of kids all over the country who were using these new devices. It was enthusiasm, it was enjoyment. And I needed a direction and that's what it gave me. It gave me a goal. I wanted to do the work because I enjoyed it so much. And I would've done it anyway, I think, but suddenly, I could make money at it as well, and I could make a living. And I could afford to do things that I couldn't do before. And that was even more motivation. And then you're making the sort of money that makes you think, "Seriously, we need to consider whether this is a proper business." And at that point then your options gradually start falling off the table, just because you're focusing on that. I remember certainly concentrating a lot more on developing games than I was on school work. I remember that certainly towards the end of the A levels. Video games business back in the early '80s didn't really exist. So everyone who was getting into that field was making it up. There was no precedent, there was no, "This is how to do it." There was no rule book. So, essentially, there was no experience. FERGUS MCGOVERN: Those early years when the games industry was starting off, I just felt that there was this movement that you could start your own business. You didn't have to have a lot of money as long as you worked hard. The barriers to entry were virtually nil. You just had to get yourself a computer which you could program and some sort of duplicating device to make the cassettes and you were up and running. It was very chaotic, and there were a lot of people who were just selling anything they could, because you could sell anything back then. There was a new market that was desperate for software, and people were selling any old crap, to be honest. And there was a Bug-Byte Asteroid advertised, I thought, "Yeah. I quite like Bug-Byte. This should be quite good." So I bought this Asteroid. It cost seven quid. Seven quid! And I loaded it up and it was dreadful. It was like character mode asteroids. And you didn't have single shots that came out of the front of the ship. You had a line a full stops that came out. And you pressed the fire button, these full stops came out and it made a noise like a Hoover. It was just terrible game design and really badly made. This is the game that pushed me over the edge and made me think, "Well, we could do better than this. Let's do our own software house." '82 was really when the market started to explode and all these little British companies started coming to life. And fuelled, really, off the back of the ZX81. And people selling games mail order that they were writing in their bedrooms and mailing things out from them in little brown paper bags. It was very, very exciting. But one could really see that something was beginning to happen there. ROGER KEAN: None of these games were in shops. Smiths didn't have them, Boots didn't have them, Minis, as they were at the time, you just couldn't buy the games. And yet there seemed to be a demand for them. It was obvious from magazines like Computer and Video Games that there was a demand. So that's why we formulated the mail order. And we tried it, we put our feet in the water and just tried it, just a toe. And the response was very good. There was no computer game retailing in Britain when Imagine first started. So it was all done by mail order. So what we did is we made the first game, which was called Arcadia, and then we advertised Arcadia, and then the money just came piling in in envelopes, the £5.50s. And we, all of us, were wrapping them up, addressing them and putting them in sacks, and they were going out. Companies like Hewson Consultants were taking out their own advertisements, and they were duplicating cassettes for the Spectrum largely and sending those out. Bug-Byte was doing exactly the same thing. They were literally running their own cassettes and sending them out. Rod Cousens' Quicksilva was already up and running. We used to take out a tiny classified ad in the Popular Computing Weekly and we'd be selling games at 2.99, 3.99, 4.99, and occasionally you'd sell a RAM pack on the back of it. Christmas '83 was just ridiculous mail order, where we had sacks and sacks of mail coming in and going out every day. It was just absolutely absurd. And it was all hands on deck because we were just trying to keep up with the orders. The way that we sold, apart from mail order, was Microfairs in the UK. And Microfairs seemed to be loads and loads of little stall holders, and sometimes it was no more than a table and a couple of posters at the back and selling things for fivers over the counter. And the catalyst for bringing people together was a guy called Mike Johnston, and during his Microfair days a core of enthusiasts had changed to a core of movers and shakers. If the UK industry really has precipitated going from bedrooms to billions, it was because of the people that met for the first time during Mike Johnston's Microfairs. And the ZX Microfairs were organised in London, where you could hire a table, lay out whatever you've got to sell, and people come. And I tell you, literally, I've stood behind my table with people thrusting £20 notes at you. £20 note, £20 note. And you're going, "Yes, okay, I'll take your £20 note. What do you want?" And thinking, "Hmm, this is more £20 notes than I have ever seen in my life." So there were ZX Microfairs held every few months, and it was a way that just the general public could get hold of what they wanted. ROD COUSENS: And we'd go to these, set up a couple of trestles with a plank across it with some black cloth over it, pile the tapes high, we'd sell them for a fiver. And that gave us the cash to go on and build the business. And we went up to Manchester, to the Northern Computer Fair, and it just absolutely exploded and we ended up with about half a million in cash. We were standing in the Hotel Piccadilly jumping up and down on the bed throwing it up in the air because we'd arrived. They were where everybody saw the new stuff that was in development and you'd go along and... It was a point of contact between the people developing the software and the people consuming it. And I always really liked that because rather than just selling games to people that you don't... Faceless people you don't know, to actually meet these people face-to-face at a computer show and play doubles with them and talk about the games and just get on with them as friends. I mean, a lot of these people became my friends, it was really good. It became a social thing, as much as a sales thing, to go these things for us. The Microfairs was, I guess, one of the first times that we actually came face-to-face with our public. We're actually selling direct to people rather than through mail order. And the other thing that happened was the first game shop opened up, which was Buffer Micro Shop in London. And that was the first one. Before that, there weren't any shops selling computer games. I mean, we supplied them with games and sold games through there, which was very good for us. It wasn't enormous numbers, but I think it was a key indicator of what was to come. We were hearing stories and we were figuring out that there was a market beginning. It was quite mail-order oriented at that point. But the start of games on the shelves in certain small shops and so on was happening, and you could go down to little, tiny stores and buy from a small selection of games. Thousands of independent retailers popped up all over the country, and they'd be like shops which would be above Indian restaurants and there'd be a shop around the corner of the newsagents. There's just, like, little shops everywhere. I ended up starting an independent retail outlet, much like other people did at that time, out of the most unlikely premises you can imagine, but nonetheless we did it. We specialised in selling Sinclair Spectrums and Sinclair Spectrum software. I was buying a chunk of the software that I was selling from guys who were selling it out the back of a car. And then we were selling from a hole in the wall, and that was the sort of nature of the business. There were no real distributors of games. I mean, we used to sell Llamasoft games. Jeff Minter's mum used to come in and bring a box of games for us to sell. PETER STONE: It was all very cottage industry because I remember, for example, I was forever having to argue with the mums and the dads of the programmers about how to work out VAT. Because the invoices would always be wrong. We had our comic shops, we had our record shops, we had our video stores, so obviously we had our game shops. And they were usually, invariably full to the gunwales of enthusiastic young boys, mostly. If they had not existed, we more than likely wouldn't have the industry that we have. You go into your local store and it's a hub because you've got this kind of nerdy culture that's evolving. I used to go the computer shop. We'd hang around all afternoon in the computer shop, from 12:00 till 5:00, just talking about games. The computer shops had a very much sort of hacker type community about them. You'd go in and there'd be somebody who knew some stuff and you'd talk to them. It inspired a whole generation of young boys to go into shops and type, "10 print 'something rude' 20, go to 10." It was de rigueur for a whole set of youth. They were an early gathering point for people who played games and people who wrote games. So, we used to have kids coming into the store. They'd bought a computer and now they'd taken it home and they were making games themselves on the machines, and coming in on Saturday afternoons. It was a bit like a youth club. And they would swap their games on cassette that they'd made. And that's where I think we started to get involved with the kids who were making the games. I actually sold my house, downgraded and raised some money to open my own computer shop. It was a computer shop mainly selling software, and that was called Just Micro in Sheffield. I was exposed to a lot of the young kids and students around Sheffield who used to come into the shop, and they'd put their demos on the machines, 'cause you would let people use the machines. And we started chatting to various kids and talking about what their aspirations were, etc. And we identified a few individuals that we could possibly look to employ and start developing our own product. And one of those individuals was Peter Harrap who was the original designer of the Wanted: Monty Mole. PETER HARRAP: Ian Stewart, the owner and founder of Gremlin, he asked me to work on a game based on a mole. And I thought, "Well, moles dig, they mine." I didn't like the games where you'd dig into the ground, but I did like Manic Miner. I thought, "Yeah, okay, I'll do that kind of game. I enjoy it. "I enjoy that style of game. I'll enjoy creating it." And so the commercial aspect came into it then because they were wanting to be a publisher. And everything really started from that point. Once we got a few employees going, Tony Crowther came on board, and the company built and built and built over the years then. Businesses in those days had grown up out of a mail order background. And for the market to go mainstream, we needed to access the retail community. We needed to get the games on the high street. The hardware in essence was sold through the high street. So, the first time it became clear to us that the video game business was actually starting to become a business, when you had retail chains like WHSmith starting to carry games. And WHSmith in particular had one of the most progressive buyers, who'd come out of another field and he'd got into this, and he'd also sensed the new world order. Right? And his name was John Rowland. And he made contact with software publishers which were essentially hobbyist companies. We were all bedroom guys, you know, doing it in our spare time. And half of the questions we couldn't answer when he demanded things like discounts and retail pricing and structure, etc. I mean, we were bluffing it. You know, we were just doing it off of the seat of our pants. We didn't know. Now we were at university at this time. And we didn't want to come across as amateurs. And in those days, the telephone boxes, you'd make a telephone call, it'd go beep, and you'd have to put 10p in, which felt to us desperately, desperately like we were very amateurish. And so we had to scour the whole of Manchester to find phone boxes which you could preload. And we'd phone up the main buyer at WHSmith, and we'd pretend to be very business-like and we'd wait until all the cars had gone by. And I'd say, "Hello, John. It's Charles Cecil from Artic Computing. "We've got this new adventure game." And he'd say, "Great, is it like the other ones?" "Yeah." "Send us 5,000." And the manufacturing cost to make that many, 'cause these games were on cassette tape, so it probably cost 35, 40 pence a unit to make that, and he was giving you a wholesale price of £3.50, £4.00. And an order for 5,000 straight off. You're already in profit from your first Smith's order. It's only years later that I realised how the micro shops had sort of grown the business to begin with, but only very locally. And then they were completely subsumed the minute that WHSmith and Boots, the two key players, realised the potential and went into the games business big time. In a sense, that made mail order redundant. I think that happened rapidly between 1983 and 1984. I mean, suddenly all the major retailers were stocking up on games and people no longer had to buy them mail order through the fanzines. They actually just walked into the stores. And people like Microdeal had started and CentreSoft had started. It was getting directly supplied to the stores, so it did change. It was just CentreSoft distribution, and that was really growing like crazy, but using many publishers from America. I'd never been there at that time. What I was doing was I was using Compute! magazine and other magazines to look at adverts that American companies were placing. They were all small at that time, there was nobody big. And they'd all got sort of individual games. And then I'd buy those. So I was expanding my catalogue of products. American development at the time for Cosmi was one guy. Just one. And he wrote Forbidden Forest on his own. Beach Head was one guy, Bruce Carver, who owned the company, and David Ashby was his salesman, and that was it. So they were just a cottage industry themselves. So what was odd, and this is an odd recollection, I'd say, "I want to buy the licence for England." And they go, "Well, why not? "I mean, England? I mean, do they have a games industry?" So for me to get a contract... I didn't even know what a contract was. I said, "Yeah, okay, well, I'll pay you, I don't know, $1 a game. "And I'll guarantee you I'll sell 10,000." I just plucked these numbers out of the air. You know, who cares? They were just numbers and they said, "That sounds good. We'll do that." Because they had no way of selling their products in England without me going and knocking on their door and saying, "I'll sell them for you." Nobody had been before me to say, "I've got a distribution company and I want to sell your products." And that's when I decided that, "Okay, I want to bring this brand together." So although it's Access Software and Cosmi and whatever the other brands are, I want it to be known as US Gold. And US Gold sort of... It just had a ring about it. You know, we must be good, it's US Gold. (CHUCKLING) So that was when those games came out. Beach Head and Forbidden Forest, more or less the same time. They were branded US Gold and that was the start of the US Gold brand. The market quickly transitioned from people, you know, programmers realising, "Oh, my God, I got to call up the magazine. I got to send it out. I got to pay for it. "I got to get artwork together and all of that." You know, the full thing, right? "I'm my own company. I make the game and I distribute it "and sell it and all the rest of it." And, you know, you had business people coming and going, "We'll rep you." "We can market your product, we can do your art, we'll manufacture. "All you need to do is just give us the game. "And a big cheque will roll into you at some point in the not too distant future." So people were like, "Sure, that sounds good." And, you know, very quickly I think the industry began to coalesce around those very early publishers. So, I saw the ad, "Send out your game. We will evaluate it." I thought, "Hmm, maybe I can put all this together and actually earn some money." It was clearly at first people who'd just had the idea themselves. And very much innocent, business innocents, didn't really know what they were doing, but working it out as they went along. And had good games, good ideas. Lots of creativity, but as it went on it definitely became more corporate and more business focused. And people were thinking more in units, rather than, "I've got this great idea." So it did change over time. And any industry that matures will. By 1984, certainly '85, the parasites had moved in. The managers, the agents, the celebrity agents, the accountants, the bankers, the lawyers, the publicity agents. The parasites had invaded because they could see that the body was ripe for blood sucking. We wrote a few more games and we commissioned games. And we fell into some pretty bad company, I have to say, with some really dodgy lawyers and solicitors. Because everybody saw us and saw how innocent we were, how naive we were, and we got pretty badly ripped off. In a way, I kind of felt quite sad about that feeling of it all becoming a proper industry. Because a lot of the playfulness and sort of friendly competition had kind of gone away. It was a lot more serious to a lot more people, a lot more money was being made. And I kind of almost felt like it was leaving me behind. Because I just wanted to carry on making Llamasoft games. I didn't want to become a big software house or go and work for a big software house. And so for a while I felt quite sad about all that. But somehow I managed to soldier on and find my own way to survive. But obviously I never made it big and I never made a lot of money, but I'm still enjoying what I like doing. The entrepreneurs, the Hewsons, Jon Woods, David Ward, a little bit later, Steve Wilcox at Elite, Ian Stewart at Gremlin, these were people who saw the potential and managed to sort of gradually bring in the skilled coders that they could guide to make product that would sell. So Imagine was really one of the first development houses. To begin with, it was just like four or five people in a basement in Liverpool. But then it grew very, very quickly. Some of the guys at Bug-Byte, basically Mark Butler, who had worked for me at Micro Digital and David Henry Lawson, they said, "We're going to set up our own company. Do you want to come and join us?" So they set up Imagine Software and I joined. And when I joined, it was straight away, so that we didn't even have furniture. We were sitting on the carpets. Bruce had done a lot of innovations over the years. He had gotten involved with Bug-Byte, and had helped them to actually polish their marketing, had made some connections with packaging companies. And their product went from almost photocopied tape covers with very basic artwork, to full four-colour artwork, nicely printed, very professional. And a lot of that was Bruce driving that, saying, "You've got to make it more presentable." As the market grows and people move from... They were still hobbyists, but moved from people who were gonna be very tolerant of what was pretty cheap-looking product, to looking for something a little more. When you look back at some of those early ads, you know, you'd have like a little dude, maybe a crude drawing, and then literally three paragraphs of text explaining to you what the game is. And then Imagine came along with a very colourful airbrushed piece of art with just something very minimal underneath it and, you know, you'd look at that and go, "Wow, that must be really cool and exciting." And they cottoned on to the aesthetic and very effective branding and, you know, marketing in a very sort of alluring sense. They knew how to write copy on their ads that would really get the attention of gamers. And I used to go around to shops with cassettes, trying to sell the cassettes in the shops and they did, they sold them. I don't know, they made hundreds of thousands of pounds in the space of a couple of weeks. And eventually we set up our own distribution setup. And then we rented a warehouse and we staffed the warehouse up and then we stopped doing mail order. So we had the transition. But we created the retail in computer games in Britain from nothing. And then obviously all our competitors took advantage of that. Because they came along and there was a ready-made retail network out there that we had created for them. We were doubling in size every month and we were creating entertainment. But if you go and look in your newspapers, people don't want to know about events or things. They want to know about other people. So having Eugene there, who was still so young, who was writing games for us, I recognised obviously was a story. And so I promoted Eugene as being so young and earning so much money. EVANS: And they came up with the salary. I wasn't making that money at the time. There was the potential to make that money, but that didn't seem to bother us. We were determined and dogged about making the company a success. Bruce came up with this and we wrote a press release and it went out. I don't think any of us could have ever anticipated how big that story around me became. The phone the following day just started ringing off the hook. And by the end of that day, I think just about every national newspaper had sent over a journalist. We had television crews crossing over on the stairs. So we'd have one crew coming in, one going out. It was astonishing and it put Imagine on the map. And that's what we had set out to do. It was incredible, those early days. I mean, the money that was coming in, you know, it was just incredible. It seemed like everybody had a fancy car. I think even the cleaners had a Porsche, you know, it was just... (CHUCKLING) So it was just crazy, but the downside to that was there was no real, um... There was nobody at the other end watching the money. And it was just coming in and going out the next day. So I think that was a major problem, but again, you know, those guys, I think they were a big help to starting the whole industry. Bandersnatch and Psyclapse were going to be the things that saved Imagine. So it was needed, but I think that the work that we had, the work that we were doing and the end result was so far away from each other and we had no experience of how to get there because the thing was so big. Plus, it was going to be an add on to the Spectrum, but I don't think anybody really truly grasped the amount of work it would take to finish it. GIBSON: I was busy working on Bandersnatch and the BBC were filming a programme about a successful software company. The next minute the bailiffs were coming in and taking all the equipment away. You get your foot off the door, please. Thank you. After Imagine went down, we grabbed the computers and went to Dave Lawson's house in Coldy. And all the cars went there with us. All the Ferraris, Porsches. And they were parked in a public car park opposite his house. One day a transit van turns up and 10 guys with baseball bats jumped out of this transit van and came into the house and said, "We've come for the cars." And I said, "Here's the keys." (LAUGHING) BROWN: The Stampers were really interesting. To me they were the Gilbert and George of the art world. You know, nobody really knew them. They kept themselves to themselves. They only released, in their whole catalogue, maybe 10 products at the most, not many. The day that we got our hands on the first Ultimate Play the Game game, and it was a real leap forward in terms of the quality of the games that we'd seen on Spectrum. We could see in Jetpac, you know, the real Stamper brothers' heritage from the arcade games industry. We were seeing for the first time a game that really looked arcade-y, looked like something we would play in the arcades. It created such a storm in our office and elsewhere. It rippled throughout the industry. Ultimate did a couple of things really well. First of all they had over-the-top adverts and the games weren't shit. So with the first round of games they were really, really polished and competent. They were simple, but they were polished and competent, and they clearly had their roots in arcade style gameplay. And the graphics were just beautiful. They didn't care too much about attribute clash. As long as the graphics were really expressive, the animations were cute. And really, that the characters that they were creating were appealing. The Ultimate games caught my eye because they got great graphics, great animation, great humour. They've got some frightening aspects too. Scary stuff, scary monsters combined with comedy monsters and all that kind of stuff. The first thing that struck me was that they're incredibly intelligent. They seem like they've got 400 IQs, both of them. Chris was the programmer and Tim was the graphic artist. And you know, they were very concise and very kind of efficient in terms of everything that was onscreen, every key press, every function and every feature of the game was only what was enough to be done to make the game a big hit and a big success. And I remember Atic Atac was actually one of the first things of Spectrum that really blew me away. 'Cause it seemed... It seemed much more than you could see in the arcades and it was at home and it had a... It was more than just a kind of "get a high score" game. It felt like you were doing something and it had this goal that you were aiming for. GALWAY: The first round of games, Jetpac was still in normal cassette sizes, but when they came out with Knight Lore, that's when they expanded to this larger size and they actually drove up the price point of games at that point. But they were like proud enough and friendly enough for the other businesses to send them complimentary copies of their games. Working at Ocean one day, and in the mail comes this box, about so big and it's got 10 copies of Knight Lore in it. And, you know, we all marvelled at it, how cool it is, and it was kind of like being shown how it really should be done. That's how I felt. When they sent these games, like, "Wow, these guys are so confident their game is so awesome, "they're sending it to their rivals." AHMAD: If you look at the animation for Saberman even today, you watch him change into the werewolf. It's just so appealing. It's so... It is almost cartoon-like. I think it's fair to say, even for a Spectrum game. So their graphics were spot on, they had arcade sensibilities, they had really nice, simple, straightforward gameplay, there were no bugs. And there was an air of mystique about them as well. You didn't really know who they were. And they kept getting bigger and better. Tim and Chris Stamper and his sister, I remember there was an awards dinner many, many years ago at Mortons. And the guest celebrity of the day, it was actually for Ant Attack 'cause it got an award there, so that's how long ago it was, so it was probably about '83, '84. And the celebrity that came in was Tony Blackburn. And we all turned up there and he was presenting the awards and big things, but the big, the entrance and the presence that we all paid attention to was made by Ultimate Play the Game, when they got an award for Jetpac. Because the Stampers pulled up in a white limo, got out, walked into the Mortons to collect their award and then promptly walked out, got in the limo and drove off. Both the Stampers had this sort of... They were always forward looking. It's quite obvious. That's why their games were considered, even by Ocean, they said, "Well, there was nobody like Ultimate Play the Game." Their stuff was just the best around and everybody had to try and be as good. During that period of experimentation there were a lot of people casting a beady eye on what was going on and waiting in the wings to step in with that business knowledge and kind of marketing. And I think that's when there was sort of a jump up from those sort of early very nascent, kind of computer game publishers, to the real first major publishing companies. REPORTER: David Ward started Ocean Software a year ago in Manchester. It acts as a software publisher, attracting games from programmers across the country. Jon Woods and David Ward had sort of been, I think, schoolboy friends. You know, they had known each other in Liverpool for some time. But years later David was in America. It was David's initial idea because of his experience with the arcade machines, that is the ones where you entertain rather than win money, from when he was in the States running a roller disco. I know it sounds a bit fancy but it is true, and it became the main income generator. So he knew all about the arcades. Came back here in about '82, or maybe '81, and we were back in business together doing something else. And so it's that... That was the key to it. And then we became aware of all these Spectrums and Commodore Spectrums primarily being sold in WHSmith and people like that. And, you know, so there was a knowledge of what was needed to feed that market. But they knew nothing about programming, coding or anything. So they started advertising in Manchester, not Liverpool because Bug-Byte, Software Projects, Imagine were filling Liverpool up, so they moved to Manchester. And just advertised for programmers and people came in with their games and game ideas. They would advertise to find out what machine people were using, what was the popular machine and what do they want. And, you know, it would be a Frogger, Missile Command, and they thought that they could knock these out very quickly. And they managed to. Jon was the sort of engineer and David was the entrepreneur with the ideas. But Jon would make it happen. And it was Jon I think, who'd come up with all the ideas about all the licensing stuff in those early days, like Rambo and Miami Vice. That was an important sort of stage, I think, in the industry where we felt licensed products... Obviously, there's thousands of these games on the shelf. You need something that people are gonna recognise. And it was worth paying the licence fee for that. From a business perspective licensing meant marketing. And basically what we were buying were brands, we were buying awareness. Because, of course, you can spend tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands, and these days millions, on marketing and promoting an unknown product, but when you take something like Robocop or a coin-op, you have a ready-made brand and an awareness, an established awareness of a title that saves you a lot of money on the back end. Yeah, well, this business was arcade driven as far as we could see. So we could get the arcade licences. Why would we need to have a marketing spend if in fact it's a movie and everybody's totally aware of it, or a TV series? And so that's how it began. You started to look around trying to licence anything you could get your hands on that you could reasonably make into some sort of game. I think the first one was Hunchback, that was a local coin-op manufactured in Manchester. They discovered that, it was quite serendipitous. "Oh, got a coin-op maker here." So they licensed Hunchback for Spectrum or VIC-20. And it was a big hit. Of course, Daley Thompson, coincided with winning the gold medal in '84, which was probably one of our biggest games then, as it were today, but it certainly made our name. Yeah, prior to the Daley Thompson Decathlon game, the artwork we were doing was fairly cartoonish and a lot simpler. And I realised the bar had to be raised with the Daley Thompson game. It was sophisticated in comparison to what was going on at the time, but then compared to what was going on later, it wasn't. It's still quite a simple piece of art. But I can't remember being told to make it more sophisticated. I just kind of thought it needs to be. You know, it's Daley Thompson. It's a big thing, really. Daley Thompson was a licence for Ocean, which was very successful, but, of course, Daley Thompson was just British. Nobody else knew who Daley Thompson was. They wanted something bigger. Ocean would speculatively get scripts sent to them from movie companies. There was one significant one I got. Read through, was blown away, thought this would make a great video game. And Jon Woods actually kept the script until the very last days of Ocean. It had my little Post-it note on the front page saying, "Get this. I think it could be a winner." And it was a movie called Robocop, which became the first million selling game, computer game in the UK. HOLLYWOOD: We had to devise certain areas from the film, what would be good, and replicate that in the game. And something, on my behalf, what would be a little bit different as well? Robocop was a stunningly huge hit and it was a massive game. And it transformed Ocean's fortunes because they'd bought the licences for everything. All the rights were relative to what we did and more. Arcade games, pinball machines, handhelds, everything. Either invented or not as yet. Everything. We were able then to create the games and then sell them back, either as a storyboard or as a piece of code to Japan and the States and so on. So we sort of reversed the process. So, for the first time, a British software house was in a position to sell the licence to Capcom or Taito or whoever would pick it up. I mean, that was revolutionary and Ocean was definitely then heading to become the world's biggest software house. I think by the time they did the deal with Infogrames, it was arguably the world's first or second largest software house. In terms of turnover, numbers of people working for it, numbers of product and SKUs being produced. It was quite colossal. RIGNALL: It was interesting watching the evolution of journalism, certainly as a consumer in the early days. Reading Computer and Video Games, and reading these very dry kind of things and realising that they... Consuming them obsessively, but also getting the impression that this was written by somebody that might not necessarily know all about it. You've got publishing giants like EMAP and VNU who were doing these magazines with a game section, but the games were being reviewed by some dusty old fart who'd done a dot matrix printer a couple of pages earlier. There was no joy in it. The initial drive to create a magazine actually came from WHSmith via a distributor who'd seen a catalogue, one of their mail order catalogues. The name Crash for the magazine came naturally out of the mail order company, which we called Crash Micro Games Action. We looked at what was out there and even despite its name, Computer and Video Games only devoted a fairly small number of pages to games reviews. And if there were going to be, and they were already getting on for 25 to 30 new releases every month, ranging from absolutely incredibly awful to sheer genius. We thought, our mission statement was that we would review every one. We already built up over six months of mail order. Something like, 15, 20 kids who'd come in regularly to buy. And they were always pretty vociferous in their opinions of what they'd just spent their hard earned pennies on. And it just seemed a match made in heaven. Was that, right, we'll have a few of them. Too many would be unwieldy, three seemed about right. And I just thought that was a unique selling point. No other magazine had anything like it. Neither the numbers which gave a reasonable balance of view, or the target market actually saying what they thought. And that seemed to catch on really quickly. So quickly, that in fact by about issue five of Crash, WHSmith adopted it as its official buying guide. It was almost like your school friends were reviewing the games that you hadn't seen yet, that weren't released yet, and were telling you which ones were good and which ones were bad, which ones you could save your money up for. And you trusted them as well. And everybody used to look forward to... When Crash came out, it was a big day. We were supposed to be just about entertainment. And the cover had to reflect that. It had to attract the readership that we wanted. And the only way to do that was to be as dramatic and, in a sense, realistic as possible to attract them. What can you say? (CHUCKLING) No, their covers were... Yeah, they were stunning. The only rival in terms of quality of covers was Chris Anderson's Personal Computer Games magazine for VNU. PCG was a good mag. It was multi-format, but it was dedicated to games. I always thought it was our nearest rival. On Personal Computer Games, we went from really thinking of it as content that should be written by "journalists" to increasingly seeing it as content that had to be written by gamers themselves. And at the end of that year I ran a competition in the magazine to try and find the best video game players in Britain. And that was the public purpose of the competition. The secret purpose of it was to find amazing people to bring in as writers, who are really the best of the best and who knew what they were talking about. So, you know, the two winners of this video game playing competition we had were Julian Rignall and Gary Penn. I think they were both 18 or 19 at the time. And so when I started Zzap!, they were the two key reviewers who I hired, along with Bob Wade, who was also a young game player, who came over from Personal Computer Games. And, yes, they had a very different approach to everything. For me the reason Zzap! above Crash worked was that cult of personalities. So we weren't doing it for any... We had no agenda other than... We were absolutely enthusiastic, which is part of Chris' genius. It's no wonder he went on to do so well with Future. The guy was a visionary. And he wanted players of games 'cause he thought that would connect better with the readership. He kind of took a leap of faith with slightly older guys that are hard-core gamers. And quite a handful in the early days. I mean, I was a nightmare, so was Gary. Throwing chairs around the office and punching walls and swearing. We barely knew we were in a professional environment, but what we did know is we knew how to play games, and we had opinions and big egos and we would write these reviews. So you got that "honest gamer." You wanted that passion of authentic, "I am in love with this as an activity" to come through in reviews. That's why in Zzap!64, and also in Crash magazine from Newsfield and some of the magazines that started to come through, they had a much higher level of engagement, I think. The magazines were massively influential in those days, as were the computer fairs. Because without the magazines, no one would have heard of your game. It's not like you could have been tweeting about it or seeing one of your mates who's playing it on Facebook. A lot of kids at the time, who were the main market for games, did look to Zzap! and Crash for their opinions about games. And in the absence of YouTube or just being able to download something and try it, how did you know about new games? Mostly it was through review magazines, so they were quite important. Particularly looking back on C&VG, it was a difficult timing issue for us to spot which platform was becoming stronger in terms of the user base and which ones were fading away. So it was a careful juggling act each month to make sure you had the right balance of C64 game reviews as opposed to Spectrum reviews. And then, yeah, the older computers, the VIC-20 would, you know, start to fade out a little, but some games would still be coming out and there'd still be an enthusiastic audience for those. With Zzap!64, we came up with this idea of, as well as all kinds of ratings numbers, actually showing in the expression on the faces of the reviewers portrayed as these little cartoon images, their level of excitement about the game. So a five-star game, you'd have the reviewer going, "Whoa!" And for a one-star game, they'd be sort of scrunched up in agony. And it had a lot of... At the time, people seemed to like that. Everything you did had an effect. So every review we ever wrote, every cover, every piece of coverage had some effect. You know, from the way the publishers would react, and the way the readers would react, that you had something, there was something going on there. You know, we'd get a bad game and we'd just kick it to death. Absolutely kick it to death. And it was horrible for the person reading it, but great for the readers. And I don't think we ever said anything that... We over-exaggerated things maybe, but there was always a point on the bottom line, at least I like to think so. We weren't just vicious for the sake of it. In those days it was one or two people, and they were a lot closer to the smaller amount of press as well. In the Spectrum days you had Your Sinclair. Boo. And you had Crash. Yay! And you used to have wars between the magazines about which game you liked in the same ways there were wars about the Commodore 64 and the Spectrum. So I was a Crash boy. I could have named and probably still could name all the writers on Crash. And they would be going in and having one-on-one conversations with the guys who were working on these games, whose name you saw at the beginning on the credits, on the loading screen. And you would go out and buy the new Jeff Minter game. You would go out and buy the new Jon Ritman game. We were definitely aware of the idea of promoting programmers as celebrities to really say these are the experts in the industry, and these are the guys behind the creative works. If you really enjoy Manic Miner or you really enjoy this particular game, then these are the people who are actually making it. We decided to do our PR, and one of them worked out really well. It was of course the shot with the helicopter, Maxwell's helicopter. We got permission to actually do this on the top of the Mirror Group, so we only had 15 minutes, once it had landed, to actually take the pictures and then we had to get off the roof. But it also meant we had to wait there all day for him to turn up. We were there from 9:00 until sunset. And then we get the best pictures ever because he turned up just before sunset. I mean, we couldn't plan that, but it was fantastic. And you know what, we sent that round to the magazines and I think every single magazine printed it. They created stars back in those days because the only way that the magazines were gonna sell would be if they had interviews with those people in. It was kind of a self-perpetuating motion. We wanted to learn about the games that were coming out from the magazine. We wanted to learn about the people who were making the games. Well, the first person who might already have been regarded as famous by early 1984 was Matthew Smith, who was by then not at Bug-Byte, but working for Software Projects. By the time of Zzap!, Gary Penn and Julian Rignall were just out everywhere interviewing people. Andrew Braybrook, Paradroid, with Hewson, he got a big look in. Sensibles, Jon Hare. Archer MacLean, Mike Singleton. I interviewed Mike Singleton myself. That was one of my rare interviews. He was Doomdark's Revenge and Lords of Midnight, of course. At the time, they were definitely state-of-the-art action adventures. And yet he was very modest about it. "Let's talk about..." "Well, I just sit there doing this and that and it all comes together." It's quite natural to want to feature the stars and the stars to us were the kids who were programming the games. MINTER: It felt weird actually. But it was nice that people liked the games enough to want to come up and shake your hand for having made them. You know, well, it made you feel chuffed. It still does to this day. When I get people come up here and say, "I really like playing the games." And say thanks or offer to buy you a pint, it's really, really nice. I used to go to the shows a lot 'cause I used to love those times. People always used to come up and say, "Are you Tony Crowther?" and things. I remember after a couple of shows of this, I thought, "I'm getting T-shirts." And I got T-shirts saying, "Yes, I am Tony Crowther." You go to a computer game show and people would recognise you and stuff and it was all stunning. This kid, he comes up and he goes, "Oh, I know Simon Nicol." "Do you really?" "Yup, yup, he's a friend of mine." "Okay, I don't think I know you." "You're not him." "Yes." "No, you're not." "Yes, I really am, you know." (CHUCKLING) It was like this. People pretending to know you and stuff. I remember going to a show down in London, the whole of Denton went there. And I remember somebody coming up to me and asking me for my autograph. And I was absolutely gobsmacked. I think it was because on Zoom, the cassette inlay had a picture of me on it, so somebody recognised me. They wouldn't recognise me today though. I had lots of hair then. (LAUGHING) It was kind of nice in some ways, a bit embarrassing, but I did get recognised in the street every now and again. You know, gamers would come up to me and so on. It was fun. It was a nice time and it's a nice memory. HUBBARD: Strange things did happen because my phone number got out to a few people. I used to get phone calls during the night from Japan and the States and stuff, who don't realise that there's a time difference. NICOL: Just this kid, he phones up and he goes, "Hello? Is that Rob Hubbard?" "Yeah." "Is that really Rob Hubbard?" "Yeah." "Bloody hell!" (LAUGHING) And he slams the phone down. It was a fame and stardom that none of us were prepared for. And it hurt a lot of people. I think some programmers that became famous quickly, people like Matthew Smith, I think it was hard to handle 'cause they were just teenagers. It wasn't just this sudden attention. It was this huge amount of money they suddenly got, or huge amount of money that was being created, they didn't always get it. And there was a huge amount of pressure on them to deliver the next hit. And someone like Matthew Smith, after his success with Jet Set Willy, I think he was just burnt out. There's a group of people for whom the 1980s was a magical time full of happiness and light. But it was... For me, it was a grim trudge. With... I had my hopes got up by a spurt of success. But I was ground down by the machine, same as most of my peers. So, really, at the back end of the '80s, we had absolutely everything. Thriving ecosystem, based on creators making money, publishers making money, making games that the world wanted to play. We had a fantastic, thriving magazine industry. We had PR companies, we had design companies, legal companies, we had accountancies. We had all of the other things that made up this wonderful thing called the games industry. And we were set for incredible growth. So there was a very big change towards the end of the '80s, particularly with the new Amiga, Atari ST coming in. There was a hint of Nintendo from Japan, but it still very much in Japan. It started to come over, but not really. Sega was just about to kick-off in the UK, of course, and in Europe. It had already been reasonably successful in Japan with the Master System, which was the first one. But we concentrated initially on the 16-bit, the Amiga and the Atari ST. And suddenly it kind of kicked everything up a gear, because the quality of the games that you could create was far higher. I think by the time it got to the Amiga, the flavour was very different because now these games also had to be artistically impressive. So something like Shadow of the Beast couldn't be done by just a programmer. You now had to have a team create it. Shadow of the Beast was a very technically difficult game to do at the time. You know, and it really pushed the hardware pretty hard. I mean, I have to say, the hardware on the Amiga was pretty incredible stuff and very flexible. The guys that designed that machine, you know, amazing. So from that point of view, all the tools were laid out for us. It was just a way of, how do we use these tools in an imaginative way or a different way to get the best results out of it and make it really look like an arcade game? But it also invited a lot of experimentation. The question really comes down to, how much in the way of art and sound and those kinds of assets do you need to create? If you can create something that is very light on the artwork, or very geometrical, then that's something that a programmer can create in their bedroom by themselves. When you have, though, the art and all of that coming in, now you need a team, it's a longer process, it's a more formalised process, and it gets on a certain level a little bit harder to just create. So you needed to build a bigger team, and to coordinate them and to manage them properly. And I think that... So really, the death knell at that point of the one man band, the bedroom coder, was sounding. The new equipment, as it was coming in, it was starting to come in at an amazing speed. If you didn't keep up with it, you got very quickly left behind. And obviously people were buying the games for the new kit as it came in. They wanted games straight away. They wanted them in advance. So you had to be there and be producing the stuff before the demand arrived. So, what I was doing was, I was going to this job during the day and then I was travelling across London to Bromley in the evening, where these people had this other office and I was finishing my freelance work. So I go there, work at night, and then I just sleep on their floor, wake up in the morning and then go back to... And I think I managed that for about two weeks and it was really doing my health in. And the place I was sleeping, there was rats running around at night. It was really horrible. And I remember getting so stressed actually, that I went to the toilet and I did a poo that was white. And I thought, "No, this is not good, man. This is doing my health in." You knew things were changing, things were getting bigger, so you had to put more time in, you needed more development time. 'Cause all of a sudden going from 48K, you got 512K or a meg. With every game that we did, we found the cost of producing the game was going up exponentially. So we were more and more reliant on the publishers in actually assisting us with financing the next game. But at the same time, at the end of the day, after they published it, we only got the small share back in a royalty to have to pay this money back. So it was kind of like we were cap in hand to the publishers, and we kind of lost our freedom. There was a popular sort of feeling that publishers were like a necessary evil for quite a long time, for developers, because the deals weren't great, and they were tight and they were under tremendous pressure. And it was a difficult thing. Once it became all about the commerce, it became very difficult. And publishers were becoming, at this stage, aware that there was a real business to be had here. And business works best when you have a model you can repeat, and you can bring in cost efficiencies, and you can do the same thing year in, year out. You don't have to keep reinventing. You don't have to keep doing new R&D. There's a market for your widget and you just put it out, put a mark up on it, it gets cheaper, and our publishers were beginning to get that mentality, "This is just like any other business." They were wrong. Because what publishers in the US realised was that this isn't just a business. This is about being ahead of the technological wave, and if you're not, you're dead. And the Americans were getting that, and the Japanese were getting that, and we weren't. They were understanding this was turning into not just commodity entertainment but that it was reliant on keeping ahead of technology. And I don't think our publishers did that. I think our developers were keen on doing it, but we needed more and more money to make this stuff happen. So fewer and fewer of us were able to do this, whereas, I think, American publishers, the likes of Epyx, are a good example, EA are a good example, were willing to make the investment. We took round Fusion and a very early Populous round to the publishers, and I think Firebird said, "No." And then we went around to quite a few other publishers, and eventually Electronic Arts said, "Yes." American publishers were prepared to invest in the leading edge and it required larger teams to do that. Smaller developers weren't able to continue that on their own. They really needed to team up. And the ones, the developers who turned into teams went on to succeed. And the developers who didn't started to fall away. KENWRIGHT: The 16-bit was really now in full swing, it was massive. But they were starting to creak under the load of the expectation. The PC was becoming a format in its own right now. The PC gave us the opportunity to really take it to the next level. And so we developed for the PC as a target platform. Then we'd scale down and strip out and simplify the game for the ST and the Amiga market. So big decisions being made in how games were being made then. The problem was, as the 16-bit machines went away and then the PC came in, that the PC was too expensive at the beginning. You were going from something like a Commodore 64, which might be £300, to a PC, which would be £1,500 or £2,000. And it was just too expensive as a games machine. If you look ahead about five years, then sure, it took over. But there was this big gap between the death of the ST and the Amiga and the coming of the PC and the later Macintoshes, in which, really, the only viable games machines were the consoles. Basically around '87, '88, companies began to make bets. Maybe the Amiga and the Atari ST were going to be the new successors, people would upgrade their old 8-bit machines to these 16-bit machines. There were so many people betting the farm on the transition to these new 16-bit micros, and it didn't really happen in the kind of... Nowhere, certainly not in the numbers of the previous generation, and most gamers transitioned to consoles and the market changed. People just weren't ready for it, didn't anticipate it, and the industry just tanked. So, in the early '90s you had to make a decision, if you were a publisher in the video games industry. Were you going to go with Sega or Nintendo? You couldn't do both. We planned to go with Sega. And people like Ocean planned to go with Nintendo. So we sort of diverged, really, as an industry, into almost two camps. It was at that point that we realised that there was a step change. A lot of publishers were going or had gone out of business, partly because they couldn't compete in getting a licence for Sega or Nintendo. They just were frozen out. I mean, it was pretty brutal. If you didn't have the smarts, you didn't have the reputation, you couldn't put up the ante, the money to buy the cartridges, you were frozen out. So that's really what killed off a lot of publishers in the UK video games industry. Bear in mind, there was no investment money available to us in the way that there was already in America for the American publishers. And that's when the industry, literally in the UK, started to fade, and a few people, Ocean, US Gold, Domark, Elite, for a while, rose to the top of the pack, because we just had the money to be able to compete and the others just fell away. We put our camp with Sega, which was the Sega Master System at the time. And, um... They told you how many games you could release a year. They had to approve the games, the quality of the game, not just the idea of the game, the concept. Then they had to approve the quality, then they tested it, and they manufactured it and we shipped it. Well, if you look at that, that's taking several, a lot of stages out of publishers' hands, number one, and number two is it's increasing your overhead phenomenally. I mean, only large publishers at the time, like an Ocean or a US Gold, could afford to manufacture cartridges. If you were a small publisher, you just couldn't do it. It changed the business. We were very good at the "just in time" type of attitude. You couldn't do that with the consoles though. It was all ordered and money up front and you have to know how many. How do you know how many you're going to sell? If you make a mistake, you've blown it, you've lost the lot. You don't want 50,000 of something you can't sell, that's a tenner each, do you? And just administering the whole process was complicated because we were dealing with things like letters of credit, which, for small-medium size businesses of that time, with the sort of skill sets that we'd got, were not things that we were accustomed to using. And waiting 60 days from the time that you put your cash down for the goods to come in before you could sell them on. So there were an enormous amount of changes to the business, that accompanied the arrival of the consoles. And so that really was the beginning of the end for a lot of small, creative, clever publishers, and a big commitment. If you're going to spend several million pounds on manufacturing your games, you're not going to do one on a whim. The UK games industry was completely blindsided by the consoles. It was just pre-Internet, so people weren't... Were certainly not as aware of what was going on around the rest of the world. I think we'd had, probably, almost 10 years of very cosy, "Britain is very healthy. It's got this really healthy market. "A lot of games are still selling. "These new computers are coming along. Everything's gonna be okay." And you just had an entire industry that was geared towards making cassettes or disks, having a distribution system, having full control over their marketing, how many cassettes they actually want to make and so on. And then suddenly you had these new machines coming on that already had huge pre-existing libraries that were developed in Japan and America that were very, very good. And the UK industry was really behind the curve, with a few exceptions. The Stampers, Ultimate Play the Game, Rare, whatever you want to call them. I think they are some of the smartest people out there. They saw what was happening in Japan and realised that the same thing was going to happen in America, and if they were going to be successful, they needed to be making console games because that was going to be the next big thing. They were very, very influential. Possibly one of the most influential British developers, I think, in terms of having an effect on gaming outside of the UK, actually in Japan and America. MERRETT: Codemasters were very canny. I always felt that Codemasters were really, really clever on Mega Drive because they did extra ports, for example, in the Pete Sampras cartridge, so you could play four-player without an expensive add-on. I always felt they looked at the market and went, "Okay, this is tough. "What can we do? How can we turn this to our advantage?" For us, I wasn't relying on a single Sterling invoice. We had all yen and all dollars coming into our company because those were our leading clients, we didn't work with the UK publishers. And when we did, in the case of Mirrorsoft, they went bankrupt, so that left a bit of a sour taste in our mouth. And I remember, someone saying to me, "Fergus, how are you able to do it? "How is Probe just flying through?" I think it's just because we were choosy about the product we took, we knew what hits, we were going with licenses, we had our ear to the ground, and we got lucky. Basically, the wheat was separated from the chaff. Those that weren't willing to evolve died out. It was harsh, it was horrible to see because there were a lot of friends. But you could just see that people didn't have the money to do it. So they just... They were caught on the hop, and unfortunately, they paid the ultimate price. BROWN: It just got very hard to bring original products to market. You had to rely on a publisher that saw and believed in your work, but if you didn't have a track record, it was very expensive and very risky. And they had... I think allied to that at the same time, particularly in the console market, publishers only had so many slots to fill in their year, so they had to choose those wisely. And pretty much, most of the time, it became "the less risky, the better," really. Everyone was under pressure commercially, even the publishers and their banks and everything else. All that floated down the hill and landed on the poor developer. We often had a so-called "games producer" put over you and they're in charge of your game. And we were going to produce a tank combat game, and they came to us and they said, "Oh, we've worked out what your new game's gonna be. "It's going to be a tank racing game." I said, "But that won't work." "Well, why?" "Well, as soon as the leader races away, "all the others are gonna shoot him because he's gonna be in front of their guns." And that is sort of an example of how something seems a good idea but if you just think about it for five minutes with a game designer's hat on, it doesn't work as a game. We were the game designers, we were the game experts, not these people who had never written a game in their life, or been through the process of putting a game in pieces together. That takes a special type of skill, and not everyone could do it. "No, no, we can't do that. That's not the kind of game that sells." "We won't get that off the shelves. "No one will like that, no one will understand that." So it was utterly, utterly soul destroying. The marketing people took over the games industry to a large extent and changed a lot of things. One of the horrors of that vast scale creation process is the trepidation of those counting the money, the bean counters, of doing anything original. "Hey, Quake sold well last year. Let's make something like Quake." "No, I've got this great idea. Let's do something fantastically different." "No, that's a bit scary. I don't want to spend £2 million on that. "It might not work." And that's horrendous. That's when the publishers started saying, "No, I want this game." "I want exactly this game to fit this demographic. "And if your idea doesn't match exactly what we think will sell in advance, "then it's not going to get made." So the idea of only making what you think will sell in advance becomes only making what's already been made before. And at that point, that's when I said, "Well, this is not what I got into it for. I got into it to enjoy what I'm doing. "I got into it to be creative, and what I've got here are people "who don't know what they're doing telling me what to do." By the time I was running a team, and we'd had our first few publishers either sell up or go out of business. So not just one program, but a series of them, one after another, had failed to get published properly. We were really in serious trouble. We weren't in debt, but we didn't have any money, so I was living almost on a month-to-month basis. But I used to get an increasing sense of, "What happens if this cheque doesn't come in?" It was getting worse and worse. So I was in a trap really. And it was a shame, even so, people still wanted to work at the end. I had to tell them, "Go home, I'm shutting the company down. "Legally the company is insolvent. "If I haven't got the money in, I can't pay your wages." People expected me to bubble up from that, just start another company off. But the years had drained on me. And by then, that was it. I really didn't want any more of the feeling that, "I can't pay their wage." There were very, very talented people falling by the wayside when you had what was suddenly becoming like a factory or a battery service for video games, where it was one size fits all, and I think that was the real shame. By the time that we'd finished Z and we were going on to other things, we were virtually shut out of the console market. It was virtually impossible. I mean, here's the cost of development rising so greatly at the time that consoles had come out because you were looking... You know, we made 25 grand. We got 25 grand advance from Xenon and we made a profit on that. Where did that go in those days? Probably, half a day's development. And as an independent developer, we didn't have these millions. And that's when you saw the brain drain, from the early '90s to the mid '90s of a lot of the best developers, they came out here. They found places at companies that did have those distribution deals and licensing deals for Nintendo and for Sega. And they were in need of great talent and Britain had the talent because you had all these guys that had kind of grown up hacking and making the best out of these limited systems that, when given new consoles, could really make them sing. There was more money, more opportunities. And, you know, a lot of these guys were young. They weren't married, they were looking for excitement. A lot of my programmer friends from the UK went to the United States to work and I think that's quite telling. There was definitely a downturn in the UK. And there was a bit of an exodus of a lot of talent from the UK, which was quite a sad thing, but in the UK we're very good at doing that, I've noticed. So, there you go. I remember attending the Tokyo Game Show, and I can't remember the exact year. It was obviously the early, mid '90s where Sony were privately demonstrating this new console technology which became the PlayStation, obviously. And we were all blown away by this 3D dinosaur that was being shown, which by today's standards probably looks awfully clunky. But in those days it was terribly impressive. You have to realise that the 8-bit and 16-bit machines didn't really lend themselves to 3D. PlayStation was really the first machine in 1993, '94, that had taken workstation-quality graphics in real time and put that into the hands of the developers. Not always successfully, frankly. Some developers really understood the transition to 3D, some didn't, and some developers were able to make the change and others clearly couldn't. You'd need so many more development staff to do a really good CD game, and I think some of the first efforts they put on CD was just people thinking, "Well, just port over a 16-bit cartridge game, "put it on CD, put a CD soundtrack on it and we're done." But it very quickly became, that you... Players, they wanted more than that now. We had so much more memory to work with, so much more storage capacity on the CD. What Sony did and others had done before, but Sony was the first, really, to get this right, was to use CD manufacturing and a just-in-time model. Meaning, "We'll manufacture exactly what you need to supply the market demand today "at a very low cost, "and then, if you need more, "you can have them in a matter of days, not weeks or months." So the cash that the publisher tied up in inventory in the cartridge console world was huge, it was hundreds of millions of pounds of cash that sat in warehouses or in the distribution centre. And what the PlayStation CD model did, and others that came later, was free up that cash flow. And it meant that you didn't have to have that cash commitment, and it meant you could invest the money in development, it meant you could invest the money in marketing and you could make bigger games on CD. You could make better games, and the industry just exploded. And then suddenly they've got these big, big teams. And suddenly this American mentality starts pushing its way through. Everything's got to be bigger, the teams are bigger, the concepts are bigger, everything is in three dimensions, which is, like, 10 times the work of producing something in 2D. It was a one and two-year dev cycles which, programmers were sitting there going, "Wow." But they had to take that long because that's how long it was taking to generate the art. The teams got bigger until they got to like 100 people and then it starts getting a bit scary then. 'Cause it's like... In some ways it restricts your creativity because you can't really afford to take any risks, because you're much better off doing Colin McRae 2 rather than thinking, "Should we put 100 people on doing a game "about doing tadpole fishing in Mexico or something?" Like some completely off-the-wall game. You'd think, "Well, actually we can't..." "We can't spend £10 million doing that because it's too risky to do that. "So we're going to have to do a sequel. "And it'll be fun, it'll be great fun, but it won't be as innovative." At that stage it was getting very serious. Sony was selling the development, the development kits were quite expensive. And actually to get the original kits right at the very beginning, we were quite lucky that we had a good relationship with Psygnosis and therefore Sony. So we had the kits. We didn't have to pay out of our own back pockets for these kits, so you had... Because the cost of entry was high, you had to make really sure that what you were producing was a very high quality game with much higher production standards than we were used to back in the old 16-bit and certainly 8-bit days. So there was a desire to produce a better game, but there was also a need to produce it because of the investment that had gone into that. When you've got longer dev cycles, when you're spending more time doing graphics, when you're licensing music in because you're playing off CD and DVD, costs do go up. And the publishers, probably rightly, saw that as, um... Saw that as a way to control more. They were the ones that were taking the financial risk, the banks weren't. You couldn't get money from the banks. It was a combination of ignorance and arrogance, I think, on the part of the financial community, on the part of business in general. Did the UK create great games? Yes. Was it supported? No. The UK having an investment community that didn't understand the video games market, very unlikely to back it, was going to mean the demise of many of the UK publishers over time. Because right in front of you, the Americans, they were strong and they had lots of cash, and their investment community understood where it was all going. I knew we were at a huge disadvantage. And I think after the mid '90s, when my time had come, when I needed to do something else, it had changed more than I. It had become far more corporate. All who's reporting in through who and all that. Well, that's not me. We made decisions like that. And that's how we succeeded. You didn't have to go back and ask, "Can we pay a bit more for this?" We just did it. And I think that made a big difference in the early days. Having then created your company and your market and your reputation, the next one just falls on your lap. The consoles made games more expensive. And they actually grew the market, let's not run that down. But a lot of British companies either were acquired by foreign companies, Americans, Japanese, French, German, or went out of business. So you saw those British publishers of the early '90s get picked up and either be acquired or die. And there were a couple of exceptions where companies did float themselves on the stock market and one of them was Eidos. And it was troublesome, it was never really easy for the Eidos team to handle the British stock market, London Stock Exchange, because they weren't used to dealing with being public. You know, where you have to tell your people what you're doing, deliver against it, in a world where nothing is certain. So what we saw in the... We saw the pinnacle of British publishing in the early '90s, and by the end of the '90s, the British publishers pretty much had fallen away. So, as time's gone on I've kind of just watched this whole thing evolve from what seemed like a bit of a fad or something that was just this interesting little side hobby into a real, full industry. The market these days is huge. I mean, it seems to have polarised in so much as certain games tend to make millions. You know, you look at your Call of Duties, your FIFAs, your Metal Gear Solids, these are games that are now events. You're talking about games as brands these days. You're talking about titles that, within three weeks of being released, can accumulate sales of over 20 million globally. So it's just massive. I think we've seen production budgets go up, marketing budgets go up by a factor of 100 or so, since the early PlayStation days. If you go back to 1994 or so, you could make a game for $500,000. And it could be a pretty good game. I remember making Crash and Spyro and... We must have spent $2 or $3 million on those titles, and that was the high end for the industry. But if you look at it today, it's easy to spend $60, $80, even $100 million making one of these games. And that's before you go out there and market it. But you got to think about the return of investment. I mean, day one launch revenues can now exceed, you know, the Titanics and Star Wars of the world. I think it's people have learnt to place bigger bets, or place them a lot more wisely. It's really big business, you know. To make a computer game these days, a AAA title, you know, like a big production, it's very similar to what you'd expect to see on a film. Making a AAA game is no easy task. It takes sometimes 200 people two to three years. Here you have teams of computer scientists, artists, animators, script writers, cinematographers speech, AI programmers, modellers. It's just mind-boggling, in many respects. All that held together by the producer who's trying to run this massive team, to budget, to schedule, to satisfy the publisher, the investors, the market, working with advertisers and PR to launch this big thing. But if you get it right, it's a huge return. The last Call of Duty, it sold four-and-a-half million copies in about 24 hours in the UK and the USA alone. So the rate of return can be monumental, but at the same time, it can be a disaster if you don't get it right. MERRETT: As consoles have got more and more advanced, people are demanding more realism of their games these days. So consequently, whereas a football game years back would be a number of identically running sprites, now people want Ronaldo to look like Ronaldo. They want him to have facial animation, they want him to... They want his shirt to get dirty, they want, you know, different kicks. They want all this sort of thing. And this all takes manpower. So as we strive more for realism, so we find ourselves getting bigger and bigger teams that are needed to make it happen. I mean, the days where one artist with a piece of graph paper, long gone. Specialisation is what I think a lot of other people have found. You know, you look at Activision, they're specialising in CoD or Skylanders. You look at EA and it's very... You know, they've got their sports and their Sims and... Everyone now knows you can be a specialist. You can't be a production house that has a bit of everything. And that's really important for keeping going because, you know, you're gonna have pretenders coming to throne. But I don't think anyone could take on what the studios here at Codemasters do in terms of off-road, of street or Formula 1 racing. I don't think anyone can touch us. It's incredible how the industry has changed from that guy sitting there and kind of creating something very simple, but putting a lot of time, to what now is the biggest entertainment industry that exists. You know, it's bigger than the movie industry. You know, it's bigger than the music industry. And, you know, those industries now are seeing that. Well, they have done for a while, and they want part of it. Every movie studio wants part of the games industry. We're swapping talent, swapping technology to use for both. So it's really impressive how it's evolved. But the thing which is vital to our long-term growth is the new talent and new blood coming into the industry and creating games and new ideas, new forms of creativity. We have some fantastic development talent in this country. Not all of it is on Unity. There are actually fantastic developers working on a number of hardware platforms, including the consoles. As other platforms are emerging where you can be nimbler as a developer, I'm talking about things like the iPhone, Facebook, Steam, you know, all these other little devices that are being made now. And as the languages, the programming languages, that are involved in making games for them become more, sort of unified across the platforms. People on the creative side who either in terms of their employment or financially or creatively feel squeezed out by what's happening in the old games industry are able to emerge and start again, and do what they really want, which is make artistic things. Yeah, I think we've got a lot of individual creative geniuses that have been successful in the '80s and '90s. And we're seeing that come back. You know, there's some really great small teams in the UK that are being very successful and doing really creative things. I've found it very exciting to see lots of new people coming into the industry via the indie side of things. iOS opening things up, downloadable games opening things up. There's a lot of possibility there. Suddenly you can make games on your own. It'd be entirely feasible for a single person to go and make a game. We've now got to the stage where we're gonna be downloading our games digitally, through the pipe. Where, I as a computer games maker can have a fan base, can have people that think Rebellion games are brilliant, and can give us their contact details and we can say, "There's a new game coming out. Do you want to buy it?" And they can say, "Yes, please." There are programmes across every platform that allow you as a developer to sell your games worldwide, wherever you want. But the most important thing is, you've got the choice and you are in control. That is back to how it used to be when we all started in the early '80s. And that's a really good thing. And I think the pleasing thing has been to get computer science back on the national curriculum, which was led by the Livingstone-Hope report. When we started off the Next Gen research, the Ipsos MORI, we started out looking at universities. And we found that, for example, universities in Cambridge, there'd been a 10% year-and-year drop off of people applying to do computer science. People weren't applying because they had no motivation, 'cause they weren't learning anything about computational thinking or problem solving in a computer science environment at schools. It was ICT, teaching children office skills like Word, PowerPoint and Excel. Though useful in themselves, they're never ever going to give you a career in the games industry. Prior to the introduction of ICT, or the mandating of ICT, computer science had a GCSE, it had an A Level and was studied in school, and that was just killed dead. And against all odds, we've managed to put children off for life from wanting to create technology. We're effectively teaching them to read but not to write. The young children of this country will now be set free to be able to create. Which I think is a really, really important thing in the 21st century, a century of the creative, digital industrial revolution. I think that our young people need to get those skills doubly quick because all around the world they're learning it. And whereas we used to be pretty good, we've slipped behind. Computer studies going back on the curriculum is great, but it's not just about coding. It's also about great graphic design, it's also about great sound. You can code a brilliant game, but you also need to code the graphics for it. You need to be able to have that visual element. You need to be able to sell it, you need to understand game play. And it's the whole remit. The computing bonus or the positive from the computing is that computational thinking. And it's getting the children to have that and the logical thinking and reasoning that goes behind it. People never talk about the positive of games, the fact that you're solving problems, puzzles, you're learning about choice and consequence, intuitive learning. One of the main benefits of using video games to help learning is the fact that it's known for the child. So for the child they don't see it as learning, they see it as playing a game. And children throughout centuries have played games. They love playing games. And from an early years' point of view, they learn from playing games. From counting games, from repeating nursery rhymes and it draws children in. So from one point of view, it can give them imagination for their writing. But it also teaches hand-eye coordination, control, counting, maths, decision making, right from wrong. "What if I made that decision? Why? Can I go back and change it?" And also practise. Video games enables you to fail, and fail in an environment that's very safe. It's not failing that you didn't get your GCSE results or you haven't scored on the SATs results. Children are used to failing in video games because if they don't fail in a video game, they don't get better. For me, it's seeing the children, the enthusiasm and engagement, which, yes, comes. But also the confidence to write more, to want to go and improve their maths. And it comes from that building up their resilience. But it's making sure that that continues. That that interest in computational thinking and that love goes through with them, and they can see it as a potential career and something they would want to go on to do at university. I've been working with Westminster University. I'm teaching professional practise, which is basically teaching people how teams work. So the different disciplines of game development, which is programming, art, sound, design production and QA. They're the six different areas. If you're gonna get a job in a development company, you're guaranteed to get it in one or more of those six areas. But to enter industry, you need to learn the process. So people will learn how to document clearly so people can work from it, how to work with teams. If I'm a programmer, I learn to... I learn more the role of an artist, how he works, how a designer works, how a producer works, the compromises that happen. And I think the business side has often being neglected in the UK. So I'd like to see any games course with a specialisation of one of the key components, design, programming or arts, but underpinning that with an understanding of the business of games. And if a crazy person doesn't want to be bothered at all with the business side, and many people aren't. I mean, I know a lot of crazy people who can't even run a bath. It's not a problem as long as they partner with somebody who does and let them do what they're good at, not what they're bad at. And together, they can build a great business. It's like, you can do your own thing, but be smart, be realistic, it's hard work. If three of you are gonna start up a company, you're not gonna get any money for six months. So make a good game. You know, don't think there's gonna be anyone supporting you. No one's gonna care about you. You've got to make it happen yourself. And it's kind of... That's another part of the education is making them have their attitude to the way they're doing stuff to be realistic. So whilst we're doing good in games and making great content, we could do so much more. And, you know, retake our position as a global leader in games production. The digital world is very, very exciting. It's a little scary because it's not that difficult, which is wonderful, it means we can have new pioneers coming through. There are people probably watching this now who will become pioneers and be really interesting and important people in making computer games in the next decade. And that's really exciting because, as pioneers of a sort ourselves, we pass the baton on to other people and look forward to seeing what they do. As for the future, obviously there's gonna be richer experiences on the larger consoles, but I'm not sure that applies to everybody that wants to play games any more. You know, I think it's all about interaction and enjoyment at the end of the day. And I think, when people are so passionate about their memories of playing retro games, for example, that proves it was about the experience and not necessarily about the dressing. I think that the UK stands today from a history lesson as one of the most fantastic creative industries that sprung out of nowhere from bedrooms. We were actually using the most cutting edge technology that had ever existed on the planet and kids were making stuff work with it. We were the avant-garde. It sounds pompous and pretentious, but it isn't though. There were no forerunners. There was nobody we could turn to for advice. It was truly revolutionary. You know, how the Victorians felt with blooming steam engines or Edwardians with aeroplanes. You know, that's what it was like. And even though the media then started talking of anoraks and geeks, then tried to categorise or pigeon-hole them as being somehow, you know, odd. They were brilliant, and they helped build an industry which has now become the largest entertainment industry in the world. We had such creative talent, a pool of the best programmers, the best artists, amazing musicians. And they were coming up with these very, very creative, innovative, ground-breaking products. We were setting trends for decades to come. We were pioneers. We didn't know that at the time, but we did know that we were getting into something very unique and very different. UK game developers, especially those trained in the '80s, are all over the world, particularly in the States, particularly in the US and Canada, often the leads or the technical leads, or the heads of development teams. Loads of the big, what you consider American games from American publishers and American developers have got a British lead programmer, a British lead artist, a British technical director. So the British development talent has succeeded incredibly. The UK definitely was pivotal in creating this thing called the games industry. Without any shadow of a doubt. We were pioneers, we were innovators and we still are. So there is no question that we weren't pivotal in the creation of this wonderful, forward thinking, amazing industry that we're now in. That's it. It was very new. It was an industry that was making it up as it went along, in many respects. There was that new frontier, there was a sense of a new medium, there was a sense of this cultural thing occurring. There was a sense that anyone could do anything or make anything happen. There were no real standards, it was anything goes. In that sense, it was the Wild West. So, you really felt like you were, you know, doing something new. Everything you did, nobody had done before. It was absolutely wild. We referred to it as the Wild West and we knew we were trailblazing. This was a pioneering industry of a new form of entertainment, a new medium and we didn't give a damn. And there were no rules, we made the rules. 'Cause we were doing cool stuff that no one else had done before. You were getting out of bed making it up as you went along. It was just so exciting. Thinking back, we didn't realise how amazing it really was. You know, you were imagineering every day. Doing things no one had ever done or imagined or dreamt before on hardware that was, you know, new, fresh and exciting. Video games were things that were just made by some manufacturer somewhere and they might as well have been made by God. You know, I didn't connect them with any kind of human activity that I might get involved in. It was that sort of guilty pleasure of a hobby. Nothing like it had existed before. Things that we could draw maybe that had similarities, but it was unique and new. The hours were insane, they were absolutely insane. A day coder, a night coder, no. I was everything, day and night, I passed out at the keyboard once. I hit my head on a radiator and knocked myself out for a few hours. I came around and... "Ooh, ooh!" We're in this tiny, horrible office and we're all going to the toilet in the sink 'cause there was no toilet. And we were eating disgusting, cheap food. We didn't even have a phone, let alone a mobile phone in those days. We didn't have a house phone. And there was a public payphone on the ground floor, and it was always ringing and it was always a mail order for Games Workshop. And our landlord, of Irish descent, was living on the ground floor. And on a Friday, he'd often had a few too many drinks, and the phone would ring, we'd dash down the stairs, always too late, he got there first, he'd answer the phone, "Hello, you all want Games Workshop, do you? "Well, you can go to hell." Hang up. And you look back on it and you think, "How did you do it?" You know, the energy that was involved from packing parcels ourselves and staying up all night, some nights. And drinking Beaujolais. We'd do the Beaujolais run and we brought a case of Beaujolais back and drank it all like we were drinking coffee at night 'cause we thought it was fun. Automata, it was great. Frank Zappa on the turntable, that was before CDs, folks. Frank Zappa on the turntable. Yeah. Coffee going. Yelling and screaming, it was wonderful. Wonderful. Yeah, just... There was no rules. We made it up as we went along. Didn't know what we were doing. We made it up as we went along. We didn't know what we were doing. It was wonderful. It was a fun time. And it was great to work on products that later in life, people have said to me they loved and grew up with. And I have great pleasure in that. I met one of my business partners in the past because he was a fan of Nodes of Yesod. And it's just... I run into people all the time who talk about retro gaming, and it's just fantastic to have given pleasure to people and worked on great products. Things like that. The personal impact you had on people. It's entertainment, it's supposed to be fun. And it's great to be able to create something that is like that, that really had a good impact on people. That's the best part. Well, when you're in a high pressure situation and you're making games, and you're trying to get them out for Christmas, the programming team decided that they were gonna have a bit of a laugh and draw this famous thing called the Fergus head. And what is was, was a very talented artist called Paul Docherty, he drew a Commodore 64 pixelated head of me and the programmers then decided to actually have it as an Easter egg, where if you did certain things within the game, on a certain level by pressing the buttons, then a secret little Fergus would come up and then you could do lots of horrible things to me, like bash me on the head or kick me around in FI... I'm in FIFA as the football, for Christ's sake. No. So, this is the famous Fergus head. INTERVIEWER: Brilliant! That is brilliant! (LAUGHING)
