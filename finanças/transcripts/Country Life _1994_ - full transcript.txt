Ah, just a minute, Doctor. The men have taken the hataround, and we think we've gotjust about enough to pay you. No, no, you keep it. You'll need something - for the funeral. - It weren't your fault. There is, um, one thing you could do for me though. [ Man #1 ] What's that, Doctor ? You wouldn't have a bottle lying around, would you ? I could do with a drink. In your saddle bag. It's three-quarters full. What do you think ? What was wrong with the other one ? Uh, this one's English, from Bond Street. They're both nice. Uncle Jack,there's a feed bill herethat goes back eight months ! We-We haveto get things sorted outbefore Father arrives ! Sally, Alex won't give a damn about feed bills. Perhaps you should wearthe other tie, Uncle Jack. I-I knowthis one's Bond Streetand all that, but-- - It's a bit worn. - And the jacket--What ? Let's get Violetto give it a press. Anyone seen Vi ? Oh, Sally dear, you haven't seen the latest copy of Throne and Country anywhere, have you ? Didn't you lend it to Wally ? - Yes, but I gave itback, Mrs. Dickens. - I'm sure as eggs, certain. You see, there's a most importantquestion I want to put toAlexander as soon as he arrives. It's about Princess Mary Louise,but I've forgotten what it is. Holy Moses, Mother. Alex is a writer, an esteemed London critic, not a society gossip. - He won't know about bloody Princess Mary Louise ! - Don't swear, Jack. Alexander won't like it any more than I do. Ah ! Thank you, dear. Can you imagine ! A man on first-name terms with George Bernard Shaw, and coming home - to live under our roof ! - Vi ! At last, someone in the district with civilized values ! -- But what about Dr. Askey ? - He's very civilized. - Well, yes, there's Max. Of course, a medical man,mind you. Not quitethe same thing as Alex. - But a true, true friend. - I mean, who's going to meetthe train on his one day off ? The train's due in 15 minutes ! Oh, God. Hmm. You sure that works ? It works for onions. It ought to work for whiskey. Just keep eating it. Come on. I'm so nervous. What if I don't recognize Father ?'Course you will. But I've never seen him ! Not since I was a tiny baby. - What about his new wife ? - Do you think she'll like me ? Getting more to the point, let's hope you like her. -♪Auntie Joyce ! Auntie Joyce ! - Hello, Mum. Hi ! - How are you ? - Harry. - There he is ! - Hello, son. John. Johnny ! Peter ? Peter, over here. David ! Good to have you back. How are you, man ? G'day, Doctor. - Not too bad. Thanks. - Good. This way, son. Someone should tell themthe war's over. ♪ Go on. Mother ? - Father ? - Sally. Can it be ? - Yes, of course it is. - How are you, my child ? - I say, do be carefulof that little brown bag. - There's a good fellow. The contents are extremely fragile ! Now, where have you put it ? Poor Alexander. We stupidly left his medicinecase in the luggage van, and he's been in suchdesperate need of his drops. - You must be Deborah. - Sally. I've been so looking forwardto meeting you. Dr. Askey ? Oh, dear, dear, dear. This is our good friend, Dr. Askey. He's come to help with the luggage. - How do you do ? - Mrs. Voysey. How do you do ? Say, I think-- Your-- - My husband ? - Yes. Your husband. It looks as if, maybe, we should lend a hand. Nine, ten, eleven bags. Hatbox, three trunks... and my medicine case. Just coming for the weekend,are we ? Father, this is Dr. Askey. He's come to help with the luggage. Oh, how kind. How do you do ? Oh, so many things. We poor nomads must travelwith all our goods on our back,so to speak. Is this it then ? - Ah, my books ! - But where's the other crate ? Sally, I thinkwe're going to needa little extra transport. I'll scout around town,see what I can find. Oh. They're coming. They're coming ! They're coming ! - They're coming, Mother. - I know. I know, dear. And that question wasn't about Princess Mary Louise at all. It was about-- -- Later. - Later, Mother, later. - Where's Hannah ? Violet ! - Yes, sir ? - Where's my jacket ? Get that out of sight ! Violet ! Ah, Hannah. Afternoon tea, please. They'll be parched. - My lovely lunch has goneto waste, you know. - Stone cold. They're here, Jack. - Ah, late for lunch. - Scamps ! My dear, Maud, I'm afraid I can't - answer you. - Oh. You must put that question to someone... What pretty flowers. Thank you. of a more elevated stationthan a mere scribe. Oh. He's coming. Alex. How are you ? -Welcome home to Canterbury. - A pilgrim's return. And nothing has changed it would seem. Except us, of course, eh, Jack ? I used to be in perfect health, and you were once so dapper. - But I haven't introduced you. - My wife, Deborah. Yes, my dear, we used to call young Jack the dandy of the district. - How do you do ? - How do you do ? - And, uh, th-this is Wally Wells,who lives with us. - How do you do ? Please, come inside. Wally the lodger,that's me. Where's your tie ? You've all missed lunch, I'm afraid, but Hannah will provide a substantial afternoon tea. - Ah. - How very kind, Jack. But if you don't mind-- Wh-Where's he gone ? - I've no idea. - Sit down, everybody. Thank you, Hannah. Oh, Hannah, I'm sure you remember my famous son-in-law, don't you ? Indeed I do. What, 25 years is it, Hannah ? You've gone gray. - And this is Mrs. Voysey. - How do you do ? You've missed lunch, you two, but I'm not going to waste it. You'll be having itfor supper. Ah, Hannah's broughtin the tea, I see. I'm afraid, Jack, I shall haveto forgo what indeed appearsto be a substantial repast. But my sinus trouble has beenplaying up on the journey, and there's nothing for it but my drops and to lie down... - with the curtains drawn. - Oh, dear, I'm sorry. - No, no, no, no, no. - An irritating affliction,as much to others, I'm sure, - as to myself. - Vi, show Father his room. Is there anything - we can get you ? - Not a thing. Well, perhaps, Sally,just a cup of tea in my room... in ten minutes time, if it's not too much trouble. - Uh, no milk. - Sugar, two lumps. Uh, oh, so sorry. Father, I'm sure you didn't leave it on the platform. I distinctly remember you had itwith you outside the station. Well, where is it then ? I'm absolutely done for without those drops. How can I possibly replace them out here in the bush ? If they are lost, I'm sure Dr. Askey could replace them. - Dr. Askey ? - Uh, where do you want these ? Father-- Sorry, miss. Those drops were prescribedby Billington, one of the top ear, nose,and throat men in Harley Street. Merry Christmas. Come on, Cockie. Merry Christmas. -Merry Christmas. - It's no good, ol' chap. He's just not in the mood. Still, he was a lovely Christmas present, Wally. I kept him hidden in the woolshed for months. Taught himto say "Merry Christmas" myself. Jack, pass the rock cakes. Hmm ? - Rock cake ? - Delicious, but onewas more than enough. Come on, Max, someone's got to eat these things. Hannah's in a bad enough mood as it is. Oh. Got a mallet ? They're like coconuts,lovely once you get inside. - Can be said of a lot of things. - Jack ! Oh. Uh, please, sir, Mr. Voyseywants to know if anyone's seenhis medicine case ? He's real upset. Hmm ? Isn't this it ? Hmm ? Hmm ? Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Violet,you clever, clever girl ! I'm indebtedto you forever. Oh, Father, what a relief ! We'll get these blinds down, Hannah. Do you remember this room, Father ? Uncle Jack tells me that it was yours and Mother's when you were first married. It was indeed,though memory playssuch odd tricks. I was certainthat it was larger, airier. It's the best bedroomin the house. My dear, it's a delightful room. It will make an ideal study. - Now, uh, where will Deborah sleep ? - Well... we thought-- There's this big, double bedhere. Ah, yes, but you see, my work. This will do very nicely for me,but I frequently writelate into the night. And I'm not so selfish as to expect Deborah to stay awake with me until dawn. I see. Tell you what, my bedroomis right across the corridor. I'll clear my things outbefore dinner-- You'll do what ? - You'll do nothing of the sort ! - You've had that roomsince you were a baby. -A tiny baby ! - Shh, Hannah. - When you went off to London and left her ! - Hannah ! After her - poor mother died ! - Hannah ! There are ten bedrooms in this house ! - Most of them are empty ! - Uncle Jack moved outof his room. - I can perfectly wellmove out of mine ! - And you and Violet can help me. It might help, you know ? It always does with my headaches. - Maybe not this afternoon, Jack. - Well, Deborah said he's fondof music, very fond of music. Oh, - extremely fond. - See ? - He won't hear it up there,will he ? - Well, it'll be distant, but that's all to the good, soothing. Just six drops. No more, no less. Six drops in one nostril. Six drops in the other. - One. - Hmm. ♪ They're not eye drops, - my dear ! - You moved. It's no wonder. What in God's name is that racket ? It's Uncle Jack'sGramophone. He has the finest collectionof recordings of good musicin the district. - And is this an example ? - It's historic. Well, surely,you recognize it. ♪ Alex'll recognize this. A poor recording, of course, by today's standards, but what an occasion ! Melba's Massenet concert inthe Royal Albert Hall in 1903, recorded on the very night ! ♪ Sir ? Mr. Voysey ! Mr. Voysey, sir ! What ? Mr. Voysey ! ♪ What's this about Mr. Voysey ? Sir, Mr. Voysey askedif Mrs. Voysey could goand give him his nose drops ? - Miss Sally isn't doing it right. - People often ask me if we're related to the novelist Charles Dickens, and I have to say, "Oh, dear me, no. No connection whatever." We're theGloucestershire Dickens. Hmm. Good lord, Mother, I shouldthink you'd be proud to includea great writer in the family. - Though, hopefully,a less sentimental one. - I so agree, Alexander. Alex ? Oh, heavens, no. I had more than enough before dinner. I'm sure our friends down the table won't decline a shot. - I wouldn't say no, Jack. - You're right. Friends, I have an announcement to make. Your new arrivals, Deborahand myself, would like to makea gift to the household. - What would you say to someFrench wine from Sydney ? - Oh. Alex, that's very decent of you ! Well, I seem to rememberin your father's day, this house had the best cellarin the district. The best of everything before the crash. Uh, to begin with, I would suggest at least a dozen cases of good claret. Chateau Margaux happens to bemy favorite, but some of youmay prefer a Pauillac. - And a dozen casesof white burgundy. - I'll order it tomorrow. - Oh. Do you hear that, - Sally ? French wine. You'll find Canterbury has a lotto offer you, Alex. Peace and quiet for your work,a good library, Wally brings usthe London magazines. Oh, and, uh, don't forgetmy mouth organ, Jack. ♪ ♪ Give me your answer do ♪ - Thanks, Wal. - There's just one, small request... I'd like to ask in return. - Tonight we dined at 7:00. - Five to, to be precise. Could I put in a plea to havedinner served at the morecivilized hour of 8:00 ? Or even 8:30 ? We have dinner at 7:00, Father,because we have to get up earlyto run the property. Ah. Uh, no, Sally. - Alex is right. Let's not be set in our ways.- Hannah won't like it. Oh, good God ! Hannah will doas she's told. We don't runthe house for the servants ! Four, five, six, uh-- Now the other one. Ah. Come in. I just want to say good night, and make sure thatDeborah's room is all right. - Violet and I have moved someof the furniture around. - I hope you don't mind. - Oh, no, no, no, of course not. - It's your room now. I've left Mother's picturebehind. -Do you mind if I get it ? - Oh, please. You can have it if you like, but it's hopelessly out of date. -- When I was little, - I was just like them. - I never missed a killing. Now I hate it. Go on, you kids ! Miss Sally ? - We slaughter once a week,so I hope you like meat. - Oh, I love lamb. - No, mutton. Miss Sally ? Miss Sally, Mr. Dickens wants to see you. Says it's real urgent ! What about ? Don't know. It's real urgent he says. - Hello, Vi. - Hello, Billy. Oh, sorry, missus. Max is a nice enough cove, buteverywhere he goes, he leavesa trail of bloody abos ! The natives get sick just like everyone else, Uncle Jack. Yes, but what are Alexand Deborah gonna think ? Thisplace isn't a bloody mission ! Oh, they'll be gone soon enough. Look, you amuse Father. I'll do what I can with Deborah. Yes, Wally is giving me a ride into town. - Who-Who is this Mr. Wells ? - Is he a member of the family ? No, no, no, just a friend. A couple of years ago, his wife ran off with the local dentist. Well, Jack was worried he'd do himself some mischief, so he took him - under his wing. - Oh. Wait for me ! Good grief ! It's nothing shortof a tragedy. Well, the famous rose arbor needed a lot of attention. And, first the crash, then the war; we didn't have the men. - The finest English gardenin the district. - Now look at it ! A wasteland. Do you rememberthe tree house, Alex ? - When we were kids, - Ann and I used to sit up there,pretending we were sailing... all the way - to England. - And the hollyhocks-- I distinctly remembera riot of color over there. You're the one who got there, Alex. Twenty-two years as drama critic on the London Sentinel. What a wonderful life - you've had. - Huh. -- G'day, Fred. - Good news about Billy. - Yeah. I reckon his new leg'llbe ready by Friday. You met Billy, Fred's youngest. Lost a leg in the war. Fred, we ought to do somethingabout organizing thatbirthday party of yours. Do right. I reckon I'm about due for a party. Fred's forgotten how old he is. I used to know. I had a birthday regular 'til I was 14. Then I started knockin'about the country, drivin' fenceand shearing and all that. Well, I forgot all about it. Well, I'd start with your 15th birthday, and then I'd have a partyevery month until you catch up. Good-bye, all. Sally, I'll see you at the wildlife lecture... -on Wednesday, a week. - Mmm, you know I'll be there. And if it's of any interest to her, perhaps... Mrs. Voysey might like to come. Mmm. And Father ? Oh, yes, of course. M-Mrs. Voysey and... Mr. Voysey. Giddyap there. - Delphiniums. - I seem to remember delphiniums. This book you're working on at the moment, Alex- - How could I have forgottenthis heat ? - Oh, yes ! I'm sorry. Sit-Sit down. This book you're writing though, Alex, what's it about ? What ? Oh, a specialist affair, Jack. I doubt if you'd find itin the least to your taste. But those years in London, Alex. The people you've met. The intellectuals and the, the pretty, young actresses too. Eh, old chap ? - Well, yes, - I must admit, there'vebeen one or two of those. Morning tea ? - Lunch. - At noon ? - Grilled mutton chops. - Three each. With mashed swedeand boiled potatoes. Braised mutton chops. Make sure you eat 'em up. - Cold mutton with Indian chutney. - Perfect for this weather. Don't let those flies settle. Boiled fowl. With carrots, fresh from the garden. - It's the truth. - Fred dug 'em up this morning. This is what happens when you cut down all the trees and overstock. And it's not onlythe small properties. I noticed that Mr. Pettinger, the manager of Legaland Imperial Pastoral Holdings,is with us tonight. It's good to see you, Mr. Pettinger. You might be interestedto see what's happening overon the northeast boundary... of your 30,000 acres. Now some of you already know that I have a thousand acres just west of Legal and Imperial. And on that propertyI've tried to recreate the landas it used to be 50 years ago. There are 11 sorts of eucalyptus on this slope, and under those gums there's grazing for kangaroos and wallabies. In my opinion, Dr. Askey, a sadwaste of good grazing land. Legal and Imperial are always prepared to offer you a very fair price for your holding... anytime you come to your senses. And if the aborigines-- the few that are left-- want to camp on my property,they are free to do so. Oh, why ? So they can climbmy fences and eat my sheep ? Exactly ! It gives me no pleasure to say this, but aborigines are pests ! No less than the rabbits and the foxes ! Weren't the rabbitsand the foxes brought overfrom Britain, Mr. Pettinger ? Ah, you'll find no sympathyfor your anti-British, antiwar sentiments here, Dr. Askey. That's right. - The war's over, Mr. Pettinger.- Yes ! And we won it ! Go on there, Ken ! Heigh-ho ! Well said ! Well, I wonder if we did. I wonder if we did, Mr. Pettinger. We're saddled with a war debtthat, ten years from now, isgoing to bankrupt this country. Bolshevik ! [ Man #2 ] Fuck, yeah, Bolshevik ! I lost my son in the war, Doctor. I know you did, Mr. Wilson, and no one was sorrier than I was. I sat with Dick for four nights,getting him through meningitis. - Do you remember that ? - And are you saying his death was pointless ? Nothing is pointless, if we can learn from it. And what exactly have we learned from it, Dr. Askey ? Well, I hope that we've learned... never to send the finest of our young men... 12,000 miles to fight a war that isn't about politics, but is about British trade ! But we're all British ! That's right ! Yeah ! And I'd like an explanation why wh-when... - British troops had casualties of 40 percent, Australian---♪ God save our gracious queen - You have to stand. - It's the law. ♪ ...under a British high command had-had... casualties of over 60 percent ! Bolshevik ! ♪ Bolshevik ! Bolshevik ! Bolshevik ! Bolshevik ! Bolshevik ! Bolshevik ! Well, I'm glad to see you gotthe use of your arm back, David. Too right. I'll have to ask you to go now, Dr. Askey. We can't run the risk of more trouble. Quite understand, Vicar. Thanks for the use of the hall. Well, Mrs. Voysey, not quite what you expected, eh ? - No. - Me neither. My apologies. Lucky Father's sinuses were playing up. - But those awful men ! - What are you going to do ? Well, Mrs. Voysey,one of the few advantages... of being the only doctorin the district is that,eventually, if you wait long enough,all the people that saythat they hate you, turn up on your doorstepwith kidney stonesor an anal abscess... or something that's giving themterrible bother. They never seem to wantto talk about Bolshevism then. -- Come on, girl. Good girl. - Step on it. - Come around there, Bluey. - Come around ! Come on ! - You know that doctorfella's got me thinking. - What's that, Fred ? - Well, look at it this way. If I haven't had a birthday since I was a kiddie, and let's say I'm 65 now, that's close on 50 birthdays I've got coming to me. Now the boss gives himself a day off on his birthday. So I reckon I'm owed about seven weeks holiday. - It's only justice. - Oh, I don't think Uncle Jackcould do without you... - for seven weeks, Fred. - No ? No. Why not tell himyou got a 21st coming up,and settle for a week. Oh ! Come on. Oh ! Hey, Miss Sally, don't get them woolies wet. They'll shrink ! That looks unpleasant work, Jack. Should you be doing that ? - Well, someone's got to do it. - We don't want the entire mobfly-blown. Ah, Jack, how I envy you. - I never hada practical side. - Yeah, well-- Uh, there's somethingI-I've been meaningto discuss with you, Jack. - Is this a good moment ? - It's as good as any. This, uh, this Wally fellow--He's been livingat Canterbury how long ? - Two years this winter. - And he has this jobin town ? At the post office, - two days a week. - Ah. And does he,uh, pay rent ? - No. - Well, it's just that,as you know better than I, though the familyis quite comfortably off, we can't really afford,you know, to carry passengers. Twice a week, Wally brings us mail and provisions from town. Every month he gives me a haircut because he knows... I can't stand tripping off to that bloody barbershop ! Wally's not only a good friend, but he's a useful one ! - All right, Jack. - Don't get excited. You've explained it,and I understand, perfectly. - Good heavens ! - Hannah will never forgive me. Afternoon tea. Fetch my manuscript, will you ? You're nearer. Fetch it yourself. You know very well I'm trying to rest my leg. -Try exercising it. - Oh, dear. Stupid of me to forget... that the young haven't the least comprehension of what it's like to be old. - You're not old. - Hardly the bloom of youth I would have thought. -And I'm not young. - Sixty-two. What's inside-- Oh, all right ! You're as old as the hills ! Don't worry. In a few year's time, I'll be old myself. Frankly, I can't wait ! I'll fetch your manuscript. No, leave it. - Leave it ! - Don't trouble yourself. And in a few year's time, I'll be dead. Then we'll both be happy. Shh. Good lord, Sally ! What have you been doing ? You look positively filthy. Any tea left ? Cold. Violet ? -- I'm parched. - Sit down. - You must be exhausted. Oh, I'll sit over here, thanks. I'm sopping. - Oh, what have you two been doing ? - Nothing. - Absolutely nothing. - We're bored to death. Do something then. Find something to do. Here ? Good heavens, what ? I have my work, of course. There's the garden. If you really want to make yourself useful, there's the station hand's children to teach. Half of them can't even read or write. - I'd be no good at that. - Sometimes I think... I'm the only person in thishouse who actually enjoys life. You'd learn. Look at me. I only started workingon the property when the menwent off to war. Now I love it. You really expect meto just drop everything... and become schoolteacherto some dirty children ? - You said you were bored. - I'm not as bored as that. All right. -Uh, not having any tea, miss ? - I think I'll have a bath. Right. Uh, is-is that, uh, fresh tea, Violet ? Just made, yes, sir. No milk, two lumps. Exactement.

Three hundredand twenty-one pages... in which there isn'ta single sentence worth reading. -- Just listen to this.I'll give you an example. - No, it's all right. - Ah-- -- I'll put it back. - He won't even notice. - Listen to this. "Miss Gwendolyn Ashley, she of the twinkling toes, "has lost none of her vivacious charm since she won all hearts... as Odette in Parisienne, andI was but one of the multitudeto salute her return." It isn't even a book ! It's just a collection of hisrotten, old press cuttings ! He never pretended to be anything other than a critic. Is this what our work'sbeen about all these years ? During the war when you and Ihad to run the propertypractically on our own ? Is this why, on the fifthof the month every monthfor 25 years, I've sent that checkto England ? So that this humbugof a man could writeabout "Miss Gwendolyn Ashley, she of the twinkling toes" ? I've wasted my entire life ! He'll hear you, Uncle Jack. - And you, Sally. - What about you ? He didn't think twice about youwhen your mother died. No ! The gifted member of the family;he had to run off to Londonto pursue his important career ! Worse things have happened, Uncle Jack. - What about poor Billy ? - Come in ! I'll be attending to your midnight needs from now on. Holy smoke, Jack. Three bull's-eyes in a row ! Always said you were the best shot in the district. Hey, Max, take a look at this. The best shot - in the district. - What are you killing now ? - Parrots. - Why ? They eat the apples on the apple trees. - I don't see any apples, Jack. - Well, there will be. They may as well learn now. God. - How's the patient ? - Well, they wouldn'tlet me see him. I come all this way,now I'm told he's havinga little lie down after lunch... and is not to be disturbed. Him and his wife. Separate rooms, if it's any consolation. That so ? How did he get her in the first place, Max ? Beautiful, vibrant, young woman like that. Is she faithful to him,do you think ? Unfortunately, yes. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Now then, you coves. You shouldn't go talking about women like that. Immorality is no joke. As I know better than most. - When I think of the successthat man's had with women, - I tell you, I'm astounded. First my sister. And what a lovely girl she was. What a lovely person. And now this latest one. The most beautiful of the lot ! How about these birds for beauty, Jack ? They'll be more beautiful when there's less of 'em ! Gout ? - Gout. But good heavens, man, I drinkport once in a blue moon. Wine ? Well, yes, wine. Of course. -I don't consider a meal civilized without it. - How much do you drink ? Well, at dinner we'd open a bottle of chablis. And then, it goes without saying, red wine with the meat. Two bottles a day ? What ? You drink two bottles a day ? Well, yes. Well, it's gout, I'm afraid. If you want that pain in your leg to get better, you'll have to cut down... to two glasses a day, in a month's time maybe three. Uh, Dr. Askey, uh,there's one small matterI'd like to discuss with you. But, first, be so kindas to close the door. Yes, thank you. Uh, this is a ratherdelicate matter. I'm not sure quitehow best to put it. - Um... as you know, - I have a young wife, uh, to whom I owecertain duties. Do you follow me ? To whom I have certainmarital obligations. -- Ah. - Yes. - Well, lately-- well, some months now,actually-- I've been havingdifficulty fulfillingthose obligations, and, uh, I was wonderingif there was somethingyou could suggest. Hmm. Well, physiologically, I doubt there's much wrong, for a man of your age - that is. - Hmm. I'm sure when you cut down on the drinks, things will... pick up. Well, I was thinkingmore along the linesof some sort of medicine, some sort of a pill ? There's nothing that springs to mind. Dr. Askey,uh, that side of life, it really isquite important to me. Uh, you must understandthat at one time I was c-- This is reallytoo embarrassing. Yes, well, I'm afraid it's rather a case of the Lord giveth... and the Lord taketh away. But I'm sure when you cut down on the drink-- Good God ! You're supposed to be a medical man ! There must be something you can suggest ! Well, you could try dried kangaroo dung. Aborigines swear by it. - He's a cranky old goat,your father, isn't he ? - Then it's nothing serious ? -- The pain in his leg is gout. - He drinks too much. - He's not the only one. Uncle Jack hasn't done a day's work in weeks. - Well, 20 miles here,20 miles back. - Another day gone. - I must be off. - You said you were staying to dinner. - Too much to do. - Hannah has cookeda fowl especially-- Max, I'm so sorry. Have I delayed you ? No, not really. Only it's this heat. I simply can't keep goingwithout a lie down after lunch. I'd love a lie downafter lunch. So, are you staying to dinner ? - No, Dr. Askeyhas to get back to town. - He's got patients to attend to. Well, then you can leave first thing in the morning and be in town by 9:00. You haven't asked about your husband. Alexander ? Oh, he drinks too much. All his doctors have told him,but he never listens. Now, are you staying ? All right. I suppose it's pointless rushing away now. There's a man arrived at the door, Miss Sally. He says it's important. - That's nice perfumeyou've got on. - It's French. I smell of carbolic. That's nice too. Dr. Askey, you're required at once ! A man's been seriously injuredat the railway station. Oh, dear. And I want to see moreof your silly, old gum treesand the kangaroo. "Hopping about." Yes, "hopping about." So when shall we see you again ? Well, as soon as your husband contracts his next fatal illness, I suppose. Then in no time at all. - Didn't you getmy message ? - I did indeed, Wal. But I got more than one patient, and some of them are actually sick. - Yeah, but Mrs. Voysey saysit's real bad this time. - Look, she sent you this note. Like the smell, Wal ? My wife had a soap oncesmelled like this. No soap ever - smelled like that. - Can you come ? All right, Wal, you win. - Two more patients first though. - I'll meet you outsidethe post office in an hour. - Yeah, well, don't be too long ! - We'll miss dinner ! - No, no, no ! - I will not see your Dr. Askey ! The man has the sensibilitiesof a vet ! Let him minister to the barnyard animals, not to me ! But you haven't slept a wink. None of us have. At least take some medicine for the pain. It won't do any good. Oh, very well. - I'm doing it ! - Here, take two of these it says. -- Oh, not these. - The drops, the drops ! - But what are these ? -- Horse pills. - Horse pills from the vet. - Useless. - Here. - Medicine for the doctor. Medicinal purposes. You're not the only onehe won't see, old chap. - Barely spoken a word to mein a fortnight. - Huh ? - Ha ! - Well, that suits me ! Ah, the waste of it, Max. A ravishing, delectablecreature like that. Jack. Dr. Askey, Father says he's sorry, but he'll see you in the morning. Are you sure he said he's sorry ? - Hmph ! - Would you help me with these bottles, Doctor ? I get the nose drops and the ear drops confused, and Father gets so angry. All right. Confounded vet ! Please, Alexander. Sit down, try to rest and just be quiet."Just be quiet" ? It's funny, you know. There used to be a time when people actually found my conversation amusing. Now it's, "Be quiet, Alexander.""Go to sleep, Alexander." -Even that retched little Violet avoids me. - No one's avoiding you. To be so completelymisunderstood. It's hilarious, really. Stop it, Alexander ! You've worn me out ! Just stop it ! I might as well be in Zululand. - Worn out ? - I'm the one who's worn out. Old and ill and worn out. -- And disgusting to my wife. - Isn't that so ? - Don't I disgust you ? Please, please, Alexander. - When was the last timeyou called me "Boo-Boo," eh ? - When ? When ? Really, Father. - Throwing awaythose pills like that. - It's a childish thing to do. - Disgusting. - You see ?"Disgusting." - First my wife,now my daughter. - Anyone else ? Where's the doctor ? In the kitchen drying off. I have to apologize. Good evening. What are you laughing at ? I think I'm goingout of my mind ! What is it ?"What is it ?"This household ! What's the matterwith us all ? - It's up to you, you know. - You, you're half drunkall the time. What's up to me ? To change your life ! To escape ! It's all over for me, but you-- You're young. Men love you. -- Oh, don't talk rubbish, - Jack. - I love you. - There, I've said it. - You're the loveliest womanI've ever known. You're drunk ! Let go of me ! The thought of youis the only thingthat keeps me going. God ! Is there nowhere in this house I can go ? Caught with your pants down, eh, Max ? Not the first time, I reckon. Button up, Wally,and put some wood on the fire. Ah ! ♪ - You just missed her. - Who's that ? - Well, who do you think ? - That "ravishing, delectablecreature," of course. That was confidential ! - What's going on ? - That's what I want to know. Heard any tiptoeingaround the house late at night ? - Have you, Wally ? - Any creaking bed springs ? That's a bloody offensive remark, and I'll ask you to take that back ! - Oh, no luck yet, eh ? - Well, don't give up, Jack. - Persistenceis what counts with women. - My oath. That bloody dentist here was never out of the house. And it was my house ! Yeah, - and it was your wife. - Too right. Oh, come on, Jack. Cheer up.

Look,drink as much as you like, but please don't encourageUncle Jack. He gets depressed,and I can't get himout of bed in the mornings. No, you're right. I'm sorry. Well, I better - turn in myself. - No, no, no. - Finish your whiskey. - Here, look, havesomething to eat. Hannah's laid outbread and cheese especially. I bet you haven'teaten all day. You're quite right. I haven't. I forget. Jove, I am hungry. ♪ Hmm. I love midnight feasts. When I can't sleep, I creep downstairs and raid Hannah's larder. ♪ Why do you drink ? Why ? Hmm. That's a big question. To improve things, I suppose. Well, for a few hours - at least. - How do you mean ? Oh, well, how long have I been in the district now ? Eleven years ? I go on talking my head off, the country's still rotting away. Aborigines -are still dying off. - Oh ! And imagine how much worseit would be if you didn'ttalk your head off. "Crank." "Ratbag." That's what they call me. And maybe that's the truth. Maybe I go on rocking the boat just to... just to prove to myself that I'm different. That's not true. Uh, you're sincere. You really care. Do I ? Sometimes I wonder if I give a damn about any of it. What you needis someone to look after you. - Please don't, Dr. Askey. - Give me one good reason why not. Because you're not that sort of man. Everyone else drinks and gamblesand fritters away their life, but you really are different. Please don't do it, Dr. Askey. All right, that's it. It's settled. Find me a bible. I will take the pledge. - Do you mean it ? - Cross my heart and hope to die. Dr. Askey, can I ask you something ? Anything. Suppose I knew of someone-- a girlfriend or someone's sister-- who, well, I knew she was very fond of you. In love with you even. How would you respond ? - Matchmaking, are we ? - No. Tell me. Hannah says I'm losing my looks. Don't joke. Tell me. I'd tell hershe could do better. Well, early to bed,early to rise, Makes a man healthy, wealthy... and wise. Rain has stopped.

What ? - It's so silly being enemies. - Can't we call it off ? I've wanted to. I-- I didn't know how. Well, then let's. Oh ! What a relief ! I was wondering if we'd evertalk to each other again. - What's all this ? - Oh, I made the doctor eat something. - Why don't we drink it ? - To our friendship. Yes, let's ! From the same glass. - So... friends ? - Friends, Debbie. Isn't it horrible ? Why do men drink it ? -- What is it ? - What's the matter ? - Why are you crying ? Oh, Sally. Oh, oh, there, there. You silly- Now you've got me crying too. Can I ask you something ? And will you tell me honestly, as a friend ? - What ? - Are you happy ? ♪ No. I didn't think so. Can I ask yousomething else ? Anything. Don't you ever wish you weremarried to someone younger ? Good heavens, of course I do. And, you know, I once was. When ? Remember that hat ? The one with the flowers ? I wore that during the summer I became engaged. War broke out in August, and by the end of November he was killed. -My husband. - Oh, Debbie, how terrible. Oh, it was worse later on, I think, when all his friends started getting killed. After the Somme, it was as ifthe whole world was dying. I became so... scared. - And then I met Alexander, and--Oh, he was charming then. - He really was. And he knew all these interesting people, and... he was safe. Yes, that above all, I suppose. Oh, I wish you'd told me all this before. We've never really talked, have we ? Then you'd agreewith Dr. Askey about the war ? Oh, yes ! Of course, I do. He's a remarkable man. That sort of vision. It takes great courage, great persistence. Tell me, it's my turn now, do you like the doctor ? Yes. Yes, I do, very much. I thought you did. Is it that obvious ? Oh, it's no good. I can't hide it. He's just gone to bed,but I can still hear his voice. I can still see him. Am I being silly ? But I'm so happy. And I'm so unhappy. We make a good pair. Here you are, you old rascal. A lovely cup of cocoahelp you get to sleep. To sleep ? With that racket going on ? Dawn and dusk, like an alarm clock. - There, there, now. - You stop your frettin'. When I was young, Hannah, I used to lie in bed... and listen to the magpies and swear I'd get away. Well, I got away. Now I'm back ! How did it happen ? I think of Ireland sometimes. But it's God's willwe're here. Don't be too sure, Hannah. Don't be too sure. Come on. What's - going on ? - I told you ! Alexander wants us to meetunder the tree house at 12:00. - Why, for God sake ? - Ask him ! You can't make lemon barley water at a moment's notice. We'll all help, Hannah. Just do your best. There, you young scamp. Never here when you're needed. - Garden. - What can I do ? -- Nothing. - Sit down and read a book. - Go back to bed. - Oh, all right. - Take this into the garden. - Wonderful ! - Your husband says, "Jump," and the entire household'sin turmoil. Is this howyou're going to spendthe rest of your life ? - Running around, lookingfor an old man's slippers ? - Oh, shh ! For God sake, get out nowwhile you can. Be cruel if you like,but don't be mediocre ! Oh ! Sorry ! Oh, it's so hot. February is going to be worse. How will we ever get through the summer ? - I thought he'd gone. - Oh, I let him sleep in. Thensome sick aborigines turned up. - Where is he now ? - At the stables. Look, I made him sandwichesfor the journey into town. I always do. He never notices. I'm sure he does. If I was beautiful, he'd notice. Oh, but you are. You have beautiful hair. That's what people always saywhen you're plain. "She has such beautiful hair"... or "She has such beautiful eyes." Oh, Debbie, I love him so much. I just want to talk about him all the time, like now,to anybody who'll listen ! I'm hopeless. I have no pride. Even Violet and Hannah gossip about it. How long have you felt this way about the doctor ? Almost six years. Oh, but that's ridiculous ! You can't spend your life just hoping. Look, I have an idea. Why don't I talk to him ? Don't be embarrassed. Nothing direct. Just a hint or two to see how he feels. Hmm ? Yes ? - Debbie ? - Yes ? Wouldn't it be better if I didn't know ? The truth is always best. That's what the doctor says. Dr. Askey ? - Dr. Askey ? - Looking for someone ? Oh ! You gave me such a shock. What can I do for you ? You just off ? - Yes, in a minute. - I'm just, uh, feeding the horse. - Dr. Askey-- - I used to be Max. Max, I was wonderingif we could have a little talk ? Of course. Fire away. I-It's a rather private matter. Hmm. Well, um... it would be private in here. I couldn't possibly climb over there. Of course you could. This is madness. Everyone has to take a risk once in a while. So people keep telling me. I feel quite frightened. Well, nothing to be frightened of here. Look. Aren't they adorable ? Sit down. Oh, dear. I don't know how to begin. I'm going to ask you some questions, and when I've asked them, will you forget I ever brought the subject up ? Mm-hmm. I'll get straight to the point. It's about a certain young woman you know very well. - You ? - Don't be silly. My stepdaughter, Sally. Do you like her ? - Yes, I do. - She's a marvelous girl. Do you like her... as a woman ? -- Am I attracted to her ? - Is that what you mean ? - Yes. - No. - Not in the least ? - No. - Oh, dear. Have you noticed that she likes you a great deal ? I doubt that very much. Oh, I assure you, she does ! Oh, heavens. What an embarrassing conversation. Just one more thing. How can I-- How can I put it ? I think that, in the circumstances, it would be kinder if, for the time being, you stopped coming here to visit her. To visit her ? Yes. Well, lately, you seem to have been here almost every other day. - And you know very well whyI come here every other day. - It's not to visit Sally. Do you know what you are ? A fox. A beautiful, sleek English fox. And we're the poor, bloody native wildlife. What on earth are you talking about ? Look at my practice; gone completely to hell. - And Jack-- Poor, old Jack. - He wouldn't know if the sheepwere grazing in the dining room. -You've gobbled us all up. - You obviously think I'm contemptible. I'll go. - Oh, no. - I think you're beautiful. The thought about youshimmers and glows for me. What lovely wrists. Oh, please, let me go. - I will, I will. - I'll do as you say. I'll leave today. I'll never come back. - Oh. - But listen to me. Listen. This may be the only timeyou and I ever get to spendsome time alone together. - Nobody knows we're here. - No one can find us. Never. Oh, God, your smell. These little hairson the back of your neck. Max, you mustn't. Don't be afraid. Don't be frightened. Don't run away. You'll onlyregret it later. Don't be frightened. Sit now. - We can't ! - Yes, we can. Yes, we can. We can. It's so easy. Yes. Mrs. Voysey ! Mrs. Voysey, Miss Sally saysMr. Voysey says you're wantedunder the tree house... in the garden ! - Deborah. - Shh. Stay just for - a few minutes. - No. How could it make any difference ? No. It's a hot drink they'll be gettin', and it's more than they deserve. Me with a whole lunch still to get ready. Go on. Oh, Mrs. Voysey, Miss Sally said Mr. Voysey says you're wanted-- - Yes, thank you, Vi. - I heard you. Uh, Miss Voysey, you've got hay on the back of your dress. Allow me. I-I-I brought you thesefor your bedroom. Isn't your husband waiting for us in the garden ? Under the tree house. Is no one punctualin the country ? - Dear, oh, dear. - Here they come, Father. - Good heavens, at last. - Three cheers. It's bad news, isn't it ? - I can tell from your face. - Let's talk later. No. The truth is best, you said. He won't be coming here any more, will he ? All right, everyone, find yourselves a seat. Make yourselves comfortable. Sit down, my dear. Sally ! Oh, dear, she's not listening. Sal ? And Wally. Well, now, strictly speaking,this meeting is meantto be just family. You're not actually needed, but since you're here, stay, stay. I'm not actually needed, am I ? My dear Jack, you're the one person we quite emphatically... -cannot do without. - Since when ? Do as Alexander says. Sit down, Jack ! My dear family, look about you. Remember the well-tended lawn ? Remember the famous rose arbor ? Remember the garden in which one could almost believe one's self to be... in some tranquil corner of Sussex or Kent ? "There is some corner of a foreign field--" "That is forever England." Exactly, Maud. Though no longer, alas, in this particular case. Now, I'm not a practical person. My world has been the worldof the theater and the mind ! But even I can see, and no one regrets it more, that Canterbury... is not the place it used to be. For heaven's sake, Hannah, couldn't you serve drinks... either before or after I've spoken ? The sooner it's poured, the sooner it'll cool down. Merry Christmas. To resume...something has occurred to me. A little plan, if you like, which may just be... in the very best interests of the entire family. Now, at the moment, this property gives a return of a miserable... two percent of its capital value, as opposed to the six or evenseven percent that a prudentinvestment might yield. Now, I have been talking--quite informally, of course-- to our neighbors and friends, Legal and Imperial Pastoral Holdings. Indeed, I suggested to their Mr. Pettinger that he pay us a visit later this morning. And I am the bearer of some quite remarkable tidings. Legal and Imperial are prepared,should we ever wish to sell, to offer us a very fair price, not only for our better grazing land, but for the whole caboodle, lock, stock and barrel ! - Ha ! - Including, would you believe it,this dilapidated old house. Well, just imagine ! We would then be in a position to acquire... a pleasant villa in, say, one of the better parts of Melbourne... and be considerably better off. Hold on, hold on. What was--What was that again ? With what was left over,we'd be considerably better off. No, no, just before that. What-- What were you saying about Legal and Imperial ? They'd be preparedto offer us a very fair price. That's it ! The whole caboodle ! Lock, stock and barrel ! Does that include me and my old mother ? Do we go at a knockdown pricewith the furniture ? For heaven's sake, Jack, I never suggested any such thing. For 25 years I've run this property ! Nobody could have worked harder ! And for 25 years you've hadmy sister's share out of it,regular as clockwork, while the rest of usscraped by on a pittance ! I don't really see the point of any of this. - Oh, don't you ? - Well, allow me to explain. In my humble opinion, you are a shallow, parasitic,totally self-centered humbug... with about as much talentas that cockatoo ! -And you've made fools of the lot of us ! - Keep quiet, Jack ! - I absolutely insist you hold your tongue. - I will not hold my tongue ! That man is my worst enemy ! That man has robbed me of my life ! I could have been the oneto go to London ! I could have beenthe one to write booksand sleep with beautiful women ! Oh, God ! I'm talking balls. Jack, please ! Alexander knows best. Hello, everyone. Does he ? Well, we'll see about that ! We'll see about that ! The man's mad. Obviously dotty. Ha ! I feel - sorry for him. - Oh, poor Uncle Jack. The least we can offer you, my dear Pettinger, after coming all this way. We can't just stand out here in the open indefinitely, Alex. For God's sake, go in - and try and calm him down. - Yes, Father. Yes, Father, go and speak to him. Try to see it from his point of view. Oh, very well, very well ! If Mr. Pettinger will excuse me, very well. - Have a littledrink first. - Is my tie straight ? [ Screams, Shudders ] Mr. Voysey ! Mr. Voysey, you all right ? Damn ! Oh, my God, Alexander ! Jack ! Jack ! Don't shoot again ! - Don't be such a fool !- Don't, Jack ! Don't, Jack ! - Missed ! - Two chances and bloody missed ! Uncle Jack ! Uncle Jack ! Where has the silly buggergot to ? - Jack mustn't blame himself. - It was that old rifle of his. It needs a good clean. Well, he's stillthe best shot in the district. Please, please, Uncle Jack ! - He must be hiding. - Anyone looked under the house ? No, he wouldn't be there. He's scared of spiders. All right, Jack. I want it back. At once, please. I mean it. What's he got ? Pinched a bottle of morphia out of my bags. Now, look, if you're really so keen on doing away with yourself, old man, stop taking pot shots at other people... and go up to the wool shed and bloody well blow your own brains out, but give me back my morphia ! Come on. Hand it over. Give it back, Uncle Jack. We all have to keep going. That's the stuff. Now I can be on my way. Yes. My best suit, ruined. Oh, nonsense, Boo-Boo. Violet gave it - a thorough sponge. - That's what's ruined it. What time's the motorcarpicking us up, did you say ? In about an hour. -Oh. - We'll go straight to the station... -and catch the 9:00 sleeper for Sydney. - But my things, all my books. They can follow usto Perth later. My nephew has quite a large house, I believe. Western Australia's most up-and-coming barrister. Everythingwill be safe herein the meantime. I suppose we'll have to leave the wine behind. Of course. It's just the thought thatthey won't have the least ideawhat they're drinking. And, Boo-Boo,we mustn't leave without firstmaking it up with Jack. - It's quite important,isn't it ? - Yes, yes, yes. Of course it is. I'm not stupid. Now, ring for Violet,and let's start packing. Perth. Ah, that'll be them wantin' their packin' done. You better go up to them. Good riddance, if you ask me. Now we can go back to proper hours and decent food. But, Mr. Wells, are you sure that's the best thing to do ? - Safe as houses, - Mrs. Dickens. It will prove to Jackwe still have faith in him. - He loves that old rifle. - You're quite sure you've hidden all the bullets ? All right, everybody, clear off. Sally and I have got work to do. Right backwhere she was, Jack. -Ready for action. - Hmm. Uncle Jack wants to catch up on all the back paperwork. The motorcar has arrived. We're just leaving. Let's go together, Uncle Jack, and say good-bye. We mustn't part on bad terms. Come on. Come and be friends. We're just leaving. Good-bye. This is rather sudden. Are you really that scared ? Yes, I am. I wish I wasn't, but I am. Don't be. Change your mind and stay. What's to be afraid of ? See, sooner or later, your feelings will get the better of you. - So why not here ? - At least it's beautiful country. You won't even noticethe sunsets where you're going. - Sydney, is it ? - Perth. -Three thousand miles away. - Can we just shake handsand part friends ? - You must be scared. - You do respect mea little ? We probably won't meet again,so I can say it. I do like you. I think I've liked youfrom the moment that we met, and... I wish I wasn't scared. Oh, probablythis way is best. Isn't life odd though ? We've been close and suddenly,for no very good reason, we'll probably never see each other again. One final kisson the cheek here ? Come on in here before Jack shoots us. First W.C. in the districtaccording to Jack. These tiles were importedfrom Naples. Oh ! Oh, dear. A souvenir. No, no, no, no, Jack. - What's past is past. Over. - Let's just get on with life. Each to his respective labors. All aboard ! Good-bye, everyone. Good-bye, good-bye. And you'll be getting the usualon the fifth of every month,the same as always. My dear, fellow,let's not even mention it. Good-bye, Maud, my dear. Dear Alexander,we shall all miss you so much. - And Wally. - Think of us all sometimes,out here in the bush. Ah, Hannah, Violet. Ah, goodness me, yes. Uh... Good-bye. Perth, is it ? Sorry if I've been a nuisance or anything. Jack. Good-bye. Come along, my dear. Coming. Bye-bye, dear ! Good-bye, sonny ! Good-bye ! Good-bye ! Good-bye, Debbie ! - You're not waving good-bye ? - Go to hell ! - Besides, - I've got work to do. They've gone. I hope they're going to be all right. What about these accounts, Uncle Jack ? - Let's get down to it. - Yes, yes,let's get down to it. It's ages since we sat at this desk together. The ink's dried up. They've gone. Dinner tonight will be at 7:00 sharp. You'll be staying, Doctor. No, no. - I must be off. - It's mutton fricassee. A great temptation, Hannah, but, no. I'm late as it is. - Oh, well, come out here then. - I've got something for you. Well, my friends. Be winter there now. Can you imagine that ? Log fires and real snow. I don't think I'd care for it. When will we see you again ? Well, probably not for some timewhat with the flu epidemicreaching town and so forth. Not for some months. Thanks for everything. I've been practically living here, haven't I ? Like Wally. So-- You've got your sandwiches. - Hannah will have packed them. - She never forgets. Here. Don't let them know. I've topped it up from the decanter on the sideboard. - You're a sly one. - Come on, give us a kiss. You keep your hanky-panky for others. ♪ - That's it, Wal. - Give us a song. Uh, can't think just what though. Somethingto match that sunset. - - He's gone. Eight-- Eight nines. What-What-What are eight nines ? What ? ♪ Oh, yes. Yes, he's gone. This bloody country ! Alex was right. Look at this garden. It's a bloody wasteland. We could always plant another garden, Uncle Jack. This rose arbor took Father years and years. And a lot of good it did him. We don't need to have roses. - What about native flowers ? - Look, Kangaroo Paw. That's a weed. No, it's not. Not when you look at it. It's beautiful. Listen, Uncle Jack. The magpies ! Isn't that the most beautifulsound in the world ?
