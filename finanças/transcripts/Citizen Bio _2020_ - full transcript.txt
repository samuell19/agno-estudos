Dissonant music He was a very controversial figure, in a lot of ways. I remember he told me that he didn't like aging, that the saddest day of his life would be to see his father die. And so he's going to do everything in his power to help extend human life. Every single major figure in the biohacking world was working with Aaron, because he paid them some money. This was a bad actor within the community who performed bad science in a terrible way. He wanted to help people. He was very, very smart. I think he was trying to change the world. He was a snake oil salesman. He clearly had many of the features of psychopathy. I never actually saw Aaron do anything that was legitimately unethical or dangerous. There's all these conspiracy theories. The more digging you do, the more you realize that a lot of people had motive behind it. I'm not sad that Aaron is no longer with us. It was a matter of time that he was going to kill somebody. Aaron Traywick, the CEO of the biohacking company Ascendance Biomedical, was found dead Sunday floating in a sensory deprivation tank in a meditation spa in Washington, D.C. He was what is a called a biohacker, and a controversial one. He claimed his drugs could cure HIV, AIDS, and Herpes. He was 28 years old. Aaron, his number one fault was he used the C-word really often, and the-C word is, he called things cures. "This is a cure. That's a cure." If he never would have said those words, nobody probably would have ever had problems with him. We're live, so... Oh we're live right now? Yes. Oh my God. Ok so yeah, I'm good, man. Uh, I'm not gonna be staring off into space anymore. So, I'm Aaron Traywick, I'm the CEO of Ascendance Biomedical. We have three, open access gene therapy platforms that are open to researchers, independent and commercial, around the world. These technologies, these platforms, are capable of bringing the cost of delivering disease management strategies, cures, um, and vaccinations to members of the general public at less than $100 a dose, per patient, for what is intended on every therapy that we develop to be a one-time use, one-time cure. If somebody in their home can manufacture and produce everything that their own family would need need in terms of their healthcare, I mean, that would be beautiful. I mean, that's the idea, the science fiction idea, of a maker applied to the area of human life, healthcare. Dissonant, pulsing music So, Aaron Traywick, it's always an attention getter when you take your pants off and stab yourself. Not everybody is going to have the bandwidth to be able to sit down and understand what you're doing on a really deep level. And if you do something a little showy- Oh, you want me to put my pants... are you sure? You can catch the attention of people who should be interested and, and would be, but otherwise might miss it. So yeah, good guns to him. He publicly stated that the healthcare systems were failing us. He suggested and really believed that the situation that we were in as humans today was so dire that we needed immediate, radical improvements to our lifestyles. In terms of longevity, and disease treatment, he saw that the things were possible, and that they needed to happen as quickly as possible. I think he looked at his self as being a motivator. He knew that he was like this Batman-type character that folks would hate him, or love him. But he needed to, uh, have this burden to... to change the world. I remember he told me that he didn't like aging, that the saddest day of his life would be to see his father die. And so he's going to do everything in his power to help extend human life. So, it was very family-based, his motives and reasons. Dissonant music I am from a firmly-rooted middle class family in Alabama. I was adopted at 7 days old. My parents raised me in a very, very small town, one of the smallest in Alabama, right where they filmed Big Fish, if you've ever seen that movie. My father was a welder in the National Guard, and my momma was a, a nurse at a rehab clinic, and later worked for the State, still does. Growing up, my grandparents they died pretty slowly of diabetes and our family, we took care of 'em. And you know, day in, day out, almost every weekend, a lot of my childhood was spent, you know, caring for my, my grandparents. One day, my grandma was in the hospital and she was in the ventilator. And the doctors come in and they tell you there's nothing they can do for her. And if you give 'em this much money every day, they can keep her alive as long as you want. I was disgusted at the idea that if I ever was in that position, then I would have to be making financial decisions based on my own self-preservation, at the cost of my loved one's life. His Christmas list, yeah, was always comic books, and then what other books he wanted. He had, like, t... was it, how many boxes did he have, two or three? Three. They were like big white boxes and they were filled up with comics. And he would never let us touch 'em. That's one thing you did not mess with when you went in his room. Yeah, if you did, he had special ones, and they were all in a cover, and you could only look at those. He saw one set of his grandparents struggle with medical care and getting medications. And, um, I think he, he just wanted to help people all round. Then his, his daddy's got, um, emphysema, and that was gonna be one of his things too, to try and find something for, you know, lung diseases. He wanted to take care of me and his daddy, and he always wanted to take care of these girls. It didn't matter, they... he wanted to, he wanted to be able to take care of them, and that was part of his goal. If you've got a problem, he wants to try to figure it out, help try to solve it, and try to make everybody okay. I went to a public liberal arts university in Alabama. I just followed my passions. In the process, I gained an education out of it. Just tell me your name again and your organization. Aaron Traywick, Coalition of Alabama Students for the Environment. Then wrote a thesis for my degree. And moved on from there into the world to continue what is essentially, and always will be, self-directed research. After doing a lot of community organizing work and establishing a decent career for myself around public health and the environment in Alabama, I traveled very frequently through South America, trying to understand a little bit more about where the psychological development and evolution of humanity was headed. Life extension, it seemed to me, was the real barrier that if this one was surmounted in some way, we could be creating a world where individuals could feel safer, and not so shocked, and cajoled, and tossed around by the pressures that come with living an existence that is perpetually required to deny the inevitability of its own demise. Suspenseful music Aaron Traywick was my first cousin. This was where he lived when he was in Washington. He learned that lobbyist world that he had access to through me. I did a lot of work internationally, uh, lobbying for foreign governments, and also for companies. I got a phone call. Aaron told me that he was in Colombia, South America, working on a microbrewery. But that gig had ended, and he needed to find a new job. First impressions were interesting, because we picked him up at the airport and he was like a little ragamuffin. I mean he was sort of like a hobo incarnate. He had the tattered T-shirt, he had the long straggly hair, and all of his worldly possessions in this knapsack, and dirty tennis shoes. So, our very first thought with him was to get him a haircut and then go get clothes for him. I had three personal assistants at that time. One of them really wasn't working out, and I could replace one personal assistant with him so that he could come to Washington and get a job, and, and have a career. We just integrated him into everything for the three foundations that I run. He spent most of his time working on projects for Global Healthspan Policy Institute. But he also helped me start a foundation for wealthy gentlemen in Tucson, Arizona that's all about, uh, stem research. She trundled him through the Senate and the House and introduced him to members of Congress, and got him involved in the business, and got him oriented, just exactly as you would expect in trying to mentor somebody into a new kind of business and industry that he was completely unfamiliar with. I got started here on Capitol Hill, D.C. Wanted to find a way to, uh, really contribute, you know, to the field, to aging research, and particularly the underlying causes of aging-related disease. Dissonant music I would consider myself a biohacker only in the sense that Jonas Salk was a biohacker. In 1954, a vaccine to prevent paralytic polio, developed by Dr. Jonas Salk. Who owns the patent on this vaccine? Well, the people, I would say. There is no patent. This is, could you patent the sun? He self-tested the polio vaccine on himself and his family, saving millions of lives in the process, and creating open source information that was then able to spread freely around the world and eradicate the disease in a timeframe that could never have occurred, had he not made all those decisions, on behalf of himself and humanity. It's about not waiting around for other companies, other people, other researchers to come up with the cures to help my family, my loved ones, my friends, my community, the world. It's about taking it into your own hands, doing it yourself, getting the work done, and not letting any delays get in the way. Suspenseful music Aaron came out very secretive. "I have a ton of money. I'm gonna be a biohacker. I'm gonna make cures for people. And we're gonna upend the system." And had this persona that I felt was very, very different than what biohackers, who were self-identified biohackers, had previously displayed themselves as. A big part of hacking and hacking culture is working outside of establishment, science, academia, research. Okay, we're gonna make an agarose gel for separating our DNA. Garage or kitchen culture is a part of what people associate with hacking, and whether that in reality means a community lab, or a shared maker space. Just the idea that it's not part of an institution is part of hacking. So how did we get here? We have always been biohackers. For thousands of years, humans have been engaged in the pursuit of knowledge. We made medical discoveries by testing on ourselves. Self-experimentation and citizen science were popular during the Victorian Era. That's when the Naturalist Movement emerged, and standardized the Scientific Method. Major discoveries were made in all branches of science in the late 1800s: physics, astronomy, natural history, and medicine. And then when science and technology merged with the consumer market, it gave birth to the modern healthcare economy. In the early 20th century, mass production met chemical engineering, just in time for World War I and the rise of the pharmaceutical industry. Regulatory bodies, like the FDA, are then created to control them. World War II ushers in the atomic age, and cements in place a military industrial complex that sees science as something to be controlled. Corporations and the government then end up monopolizing the pursuit of science, and while great leaps are made, they're made behind closed doors. Big Pharma privatizes advances in medicine, and independent self-experimentation is seen as more of a primitive approach. Leaps in computing power and the internet bring the promise of shared knowledge and open source connectivity. But as this space is also corporatized, the hacker is born. Electronic music The internet is fertile ground for the modern citizen scientist because all that computing power unlocked the human genome. And now, players in Big Pharma even want to patent human DNA. A breakthrough new technology with limitless capabilities, called CRISPR, is discovered. It's a revolutionary gene-editing tool that can permanently edit any organism's DNA. CRISPR technology is disseminated throughout the biohacking community and made accessible to the masses. It's happening at a rate that the powers that be can't control. And now, the age of biohacking is upon us. I feel that hacking is an ethical concern. It's a good, and I argue that it's the greatest good. What it does is it takes what's available and it leverages that in order to do more than what's allowed. The medical community has not figured this out. The chemical community has not figured this out. The biological community is starting to figure this out, which is why we have coined the term biohacking and so many people are doing it, and it's a great blessing. We are trying to get medicine and medical technologies to people who otherwise wouldn't have it, however we can. EpiPens started failing left and right. As if it weren't insulting enough that they were overcharging, and they failed, and they weren't safe, and you weren't supposed to make your own, it's still $609 for a pair of EpiPens. I'm just gonna show you, this is the set up. It's the auto injector. You take the needle from one syringe, you plop it on the other syringe, you load it, and you're good to go. Is there anybody here who suffers from anaphylactic shock? Who wants this one? When I think of biohacking, I think of people who work with the living organism as a medium. That's the bio part. And then the hacking part is utilizing the... hmm.. The hacker ethic of saying, "We can make a better world with technology. We can utilize things in ways for which they were not designed." And we don't wait for permission to do so. If you put a magnet under your finger, you could sense these electromagnetic fields and it was like somebody hit me in the side of the head. It was like the revolution started without me. "Ah shit. I mean I gotta catch up." And so I heard about that in April, and by May, there was a magnet in my finger. I just was not waiting anymore. There is no fucking way that I would ever pass up an opportunity to prove the efficacy of, of this movement. A microchip implanted beneath the skin gives people the same capabilities as dozens of cards and devices. What's going to happen is, uh, I'm going to receive an incision, my skin will be lifted, and separated away from its fatty tissues. And the device will be inserted. We are not going to be using any anesthetic. It's really, really gonna hurt. You don't have to listen to them. You don't have to fucking do it their way. If you build an alternate institution, at the end of the day they will have to conform to our standard, if we push hard enough, because it's better. And we can do that, 'cause our proposition is there, and our talent is there, and our skill is there. And we got just the right amount of fuck you! That's it. There's no movement in the history of the planet that ever had such high aspirations. If we can say we don't like the structure of the jungle, that the strongest survive, then we can shift that. You see people who are not supported by money or infrastructure, or materials, and so they make do with what they have. There we go. But they are less afraid to do so. And so yeah, so when we're done, you just stand here in the corner by the sink. And if we are like "Oh shit, run and get, like, a fuckin', you know, butter knife quick.", that would be your role. You want it to sit there and get it closed even before you suture. That's perfect placement. Thank you. No problem. So, there you go. You rock my world, dude. Electronic music Almost more delicate than a surgery. There's an RFID chip in my hand, and we were just trying to get the reader working again. This is the reader here. My RFID transponder I use to activate my motorcycle. And I use it to access my safes at home for security. We're the ones that are putting in the experimentation, and putting these things into our own bodies. We are gonna be the people that develop these technologies and get them noticed before they're taken to the next step. I often harken back to the era of the early alchemists, because they were trying to pursue science during a time where doing so was punishable by death. And they did it anyway. And that's a pretty heavy risk to take. Um, a number of people in this community will do things that are on the margins of legality or are entirely extra-legal. That sounds about right. The Science for Masses team has created eyedrops that allow people to see in detail when they are in the dark. The solution is made of something known as CE6. They wanted to test this out by using the liquid on Gabriel Licina. He's a biochemistry researcher. I'm going to eat your soul. Within an hour, Licina said he could identify shapes the size of a hand about 30 feet away in the dark. I was answering 100 emails a day, people who were like, "My 9 year daughter has retinos pigmentosa. RP you know, and she can't see in the dark." I'm like, "I am not sending weird science molecules for you to test on your children." Suspenseful music My name's Gabriel Licina. Right now you're in Sci House which is a 501 C3 nonprofit research and educational outreach laboratory. I graduated from high school in 1999. And I went straight into college, into the Computer Science program, and started rapidly failing all my classes. And then kind of got smitten with science. I just got really excited about how powerful and foreign biology is. I was like, "Oh, this is beautiful." I was really passionate about changing the world. I saw this very powerful technology that was capable of doing something positive. I was like, "All right, so I have a background in biology, I work in a laboratory." I'm like, "Let's talk about biohacking." I ended up having a lot of text conversations with this guy named Aaron. Sometimes I had phone calls, and things escalated really rapidly. He was talking with everybody else that I knew from the biohacking community. This would be Mac Davies, this would be David Ishee. And turns out that all these people were also kind of pulled into this because it was the magical money faucet. So we are on this conference call with Ascendance. Aaron's like, "Okay what do you need to do X, Y, Z?" I'm like, "Okay, we need a place for the lab equipment." He's like, "All right find a place." So I find a place. I'm like, "Somebody needs to sign the lease on the place." And he's like, "Okay one time power of attorney, go." I'm like, "Okay we need this, this, this, and this." He's like, "Find all the links on Amazon, find it on eBay, find it on gov deals." We'd send him a link, boom. $20,000 worth of hardware would just show up. I was raised around dogs. My family's been dog breeders for a long time. My great grandfather bred dogs, my grandfather, my father. My name's David Ishee. I'm a biohacker in Mississippi. Were in my lab. There's a lot of genetics that goes into it. Dogs have more genetic diseases than any other species on the planet, over 600 different unique genetic diseases. And for some context, wolves have seven. So that's hundreds and hundreds of genetic diseases that we made. And we don't have the tools to fix them. And so I say that we do have the tools to fix them, we're just not using them. I originally had the idea to do genetic engineering on dogs, and to make genetic engineering accessible to dog breeders, and so was looking to get a product developed. Dissonant music Aaron presented Ascendance as being a biotech company. Basically he would fund the development, which I had been struggling with, and in the end he would have the thing, right. So I would get to use it, which is all I really wanted. I stepped through what would be required. It's like, "Okay, well, Im gonna need DNA. Well how do you get DNA? Okay well I need bacteria. How do you get bacteria?" I needed ampicillin to grow bacteria because I needed bacteria to grow plasmid DNA. And so I was searching all over the Internet and I stumbled onto this website, The Odin, that had ampicillin for like $3 for a gram. And so I was convinced at first that it was a scam. Then I learned more about Josiah. So I eventually called Josiah and I was like, "Hey, can I get a little help here?" So, uh, how's the pregnancy going right now? How long does it actually take? Sixty-three days. Sixty-three days. Exactly? Yeah. So I have a couple of kanamycin-based plasmids. I was having trouble getting them to grow. Send over a list of all the stuff you need, and I'm sure we can get it out. Aaron... I'm really close friends with all the people who worked with him, and I helped him out. That's one of the things he didn't know. Behind the scenes, I was helping out everybody at his company. You know, I was trying to push them in the correct direction, so that they didn't do anything stupid or crazy or nobody got hurt. My name is Josiah Zayner and I am founder and CEO of The Odin. Biohacker-in-Chief, I guess. That's really lame. I'm also the first person in the world to genetically modify myself with CRISPR. I received my PhD in Biophysics from the University of Chicago, where I did lots of protein engineering and genetic engineering. Okay I want to show you what NASA's like. It is 2:00 p.m. After that, I received a job to work at NASA. Nobody in that lab. No one. No one. In all the labs, nobody. [NASA, the hardest-working people in the government. I was like, "Enough of this shit." I couldn't really get a job because obviously I don't work well with others. Okay so this is my apartment/lab. So I decided to start my own company. I ran a crowd-funding campaign for these CRISPR kits. I thought it would be an amazing idea if people could do CRISPR at home. This is where we package and ship out all of our kits. We send out a shit ton. This is where we keep all of our DNA. This is basically all the important shit that we have. What I'm trying to do is I'm trying to push the field forward, by doing cutting edge experiments that are well-thought-out, well-planned. Safety is well-understood and the experiments are well-proposed. When you look at your DNA, that's the ultimate introspection. Like, what can we change there? What does that mean for me to change my DNA? What does that mean for me as a human being? When scientists first discovered CRISPR, it was used in bacteria to cut DNA. But now, what you can imagine is if you want to engineer any piece of DNA inside humans, all you have to do is you have to know the RNA that matches the DNA and then you could go in there and cut it. We're gonna change one base of DNA. And that one single base of DNA that we change, that's all it takes to change the function of a whole organism. One single base of DNA. Three, two, one. Cheese. Thank you. A couple of the events that have transpired since I started reporting on biohackers, the first major one was Josiah on Facebook using CRISPR on himself. And I was just like, "Whoa." This will modify my muscle genes to give me bigger muscles. Josiah is a committed bio punk. He injected himself with a plasmid containing a CRISPR'd myostatin knockout just to see what would happen. Ooh. Hurts a lot more going in. All right, there we go. This is what people were really afraid of, was like, "What if, because CRISPR is so easy to use, people just start using it on themselves?" And then it was like, "Well, there it is. People are gonna use it on themselves." The question isn't about safety necessarily. The question I think is more about human lives. There are so many people who are suffering and dying right now because they can't get the medical treatments that they need, because regulation, the FDA. It's already possible to contract out genes to be made for you, and you can put them in your body. It's just the way it is. And, uh, it's gonna take some time for people to understand that. In the same way that man found the power within an atom, he will start to change himself. He will start to rid himself of the sad situations we have all been accustomed to within this life. Disease, sickness, feebleness, and old age. These are all things that are biological issues. The fairy tale of becoming a better person, that's the biohacking thing. You're better, faster, stronger. Right? We want it. We want that thing. It doesn't mean that we're opportunistic for trying to not be miserable. Desperate animals do desperate shit. I think we really can't wait for the established players who are making huge amounts of money from treating HIV to develop an actual cure for HIV. I'm Tristan Roberts. I was a junior in college when I tested positive for HIV. Conventional medication for HIV will run you around $20,000 per year in the United States, which just pretty much means that you're beholden to someone to pay for your stuff, whether it be having to stick with your employer, being terrified of leaving. They've got you by the balls. It breeds compliance with those systems. And it further perpetuates the problem. The end goal is to make this stuff affordable, where you can buy this for a few dollars rather than thousands of dollars, and have it be treated once, and be good for six months, rather than a few days. What's up, man? Nice to meet you in person. Hey. - Hey, Aaron. - How are you? Traffic was terrible. The person who connected me with Aaron knew that he was working on some sort of HIV gene therapy. He knew that I had HIV, and that I wasn't on medication, and that my risk tolerance is a bit higher than most of the population. He spoke of the success he had had with the fertility treatment, Inovium. Women are constantly being told that they're running out of time to give birth with their own eggs. But realistically and scientifically, that's just not the case. Why look to donor embryos when we can use your own genetic material to help you give birth with your own children? What really blew my mind was that some of them were even post-menopausal, and they were able to conceive of children. And I was just fascinated by people who were, like, not stuck to the status quo. Aaron didn't ask why, he asked why not. So I was like, "Yeah, this guy is like actually onto, like, something." Do you have a car? I do Uber. We had a really good walk and talk. And I agreed that, you know, if they were able to develop a gene therapy, I would probably be down to test it out. I met Tristan. We really connected on our sense of spirituality, our relationship with activism. I had been trying to figure out solutions for society, knowing that it was possible for more people to receive an adequate standard of care. Um, He told me, "I've got a group of people who also had that idea. Why don't you join our weekly discussion?" And that was the Ascendance group. A lot of our team branched off to form this company, Ascendance Biomedical, so that we could tackle breakthrough treatments that we felt we could bring to market, and to the individual who wanted them, in a much more expeditious way than the standard FDA clinical trial processes. More than anything, I think I wanted to see the HIV therapy happen. I talked to Aaron on the phone about what the plan was, and he sounded very committed, very motivated, very visionary in terms of where he saw the project going. If I have HIV, and I go and I get tested on a weekly basis for HIV, and I'm taking HAART, antiretrovirals, the common treatment for HIV, the insurance provider can look at my blood test data and they can say, "Okay, the HIV level, the HIV's still there, but it's at a manageable level." And we can see that if the person gets off the antiretrovirals, it'll go back up. So the government will keep paying the company, the insurance providers will keep paying the company, to keep the patient sick. And there is no incentivization structure set up for cures. If we start out with something, I'm just going to show you, just a small, and this is just a small vial of the N6, um, you know, sample. There's an antibody called N6, which has been studied by the National Institute of Health. It destroys most HIV. Like 98.5 % of all strains of HIV are destroyed. It was November of 2016 that the NIH published the discovery of finding a human that had the most effective, broadly neutralizing antibody, or naturally-derived immunity to HIV. And not only did they find this person, but they actually identified exactly what gene he had that allowed him to do that. Because of that, what we can do is we can take that gene, or that information that's necessary for defeating HIV, and put it into another person. In the circulatory system, you have the little guard cells. They kill baddies, like foreign invaders, and these are called white blood cells. Now, the virus HIV attacks these white blood cells. And so eventually over time, this causes the thing called AIDS. Well, if we inject a minicircle with the special transfection agent, a magical thing starts to happen. The DNA begins to produce N6. And N6 will bind to 97 % to 98 % of the HIV viruses. The hope is to kill off the viral load, and thereby eventually allowing normal function to return, as the white blood cells now are able to go without getting killed off. Tristan sends me this paper. He's like, "Hey, does this research seem legit? I need a science person to look at this." And I was, "What's up?" He's like, "Oh, top-secret project." It's like, "Cool, top-secret project, that's fine." And I was like, "Yeah, this is pretty legit." What we did as a team was developed a delivery mechanism for adding that gene to a persons body. N6 was built on my system. I developed a vector and a protocol for follistatin. And I developed it in such a way that it could be applied to different things. So if you wanted to pull out follistatin and put in the N6 antibody, you can do that. I forced Ascendance to do a lot of careful testing. Luckily, Aaron would listen to me. So it was produced in a petri dish. N6 was produced by the vector, uh, and then tested that it binds HIV. I got just a picture of some test tubes from David Ishee. No, no caption, it's just, just test tubes. And that was his way of letting me know that, you know, it's ready. You excited? Um, it's been, I've been waiting for this for like six months. So yeah, I'm pretty ready. Live from Washington, D.C., the world's first patient zero testing of an HIV cure, using gene therapy technology. Fill this sucker. There we go. I tested everything and I prepped everything that he used. We had a long conversation and I tried to make it clear what the potential risks were. So you insert the needle from the side. Okay, where it's nice and floofy. Mm-hmm. And then once you're, once you're in there, you can let go of the skin. Right? So you got to pull. Pinch and pull. Kinda right there. Yeah anywhere in there We do not advise that anyone watching this video do what is about to be done here. Um, these compounds are not for human consumption. They are for research purposes only. Tristan Roberts is completely within his rights, according to the FDA, and the rule of law in this nation, to self-experiment in any way that he deems medically appropriate. So I want to dedicate this to all the people who have died while not being able to access treatment, even though those treatments were available. How are you feeling? Pretty jazzed. We're just gonna have to show the world what radical gene therapy technology can do to help people take the health of their lives into their own hands. The N6 will be the frontline treatment for curing AIDS, and for ending AIDS. Suspenseful music I put him on a pedestal. I was like, "Oh my God, this is amazing, here's a guy who's, like, using their bodies as a laboratory." Tristan's name would come up in conversations all the time. We watched Dallas Buyers Club. You know, there were allusions to the HIV positive community that were seeking alternative treatments to find a cure, change their lives. Yes, it, yeah, it was just an hour ago. Um, I feel a good sense of relief. Like, there was a lot of build-up. This has been, like, in planning for, like, uh, six, six months, when I first heard that this was even a possibility. And it's sometimes hard to believe that it's real. Everybody I've met that this has been explained to told me, "That was really courageous." And Tristan is a little bit of a hero in their eyes. He was taking responsibility for his illness, not just letting a doctor handle it, or the government, or a pharmaceutical company. Him injecting himself I see as a statement of patient empowerment, and of human empowerment. There was a wide range of reactions to that initial injection. There was definitely a fair amount of criticism, and I don't think most of it was warranted. But at the same time, people who are established in the existing biomedical paradigm are, of course, going to support the system that butters their bread. So, nothing too surprising. The question that I think has been on a lot of people's minds which connects to the New York Times article, the quote from you in the article was, if they're willing to inject themselves with hormones to make them, their muscles bigger, you can imagine they'd be willing to test more powerful things. Anyone who does synthetic biology should be under surveillance, and anyone who does it without a license should be suspect. Yeah. Again, I wasn't trying to win a popularity contest. That was aimed at academia. I think the academics are the most dangerous part of our society. Yay. Yes. Disgruntled post-docs. You can't really protect yourself by pushing down the knowledge. You can't hide the knowledge. We have this little problem called intellectual property law. What you need to do is to have as large a fraction of the population as possible watching out for people that are talking or doing something that they think is questionable. If you see something, say something. We need to create that culture of surveillance. It is technically illegal to experiment on anybody, including yourself. In practice, it's rarely enforced unless you're selling the drug and labeling it, This will add years to your life. I think there's risks at all levels, whether it's an individual, whether it's a small team, whether it's in a garage, or whether it's in a government facility that's super secure. That whole spectrum could produce a bio-weapon. And partly, it's more dangerous than nuclear weapons because it's so much easier and cheaper. The Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate came into fruition after the 9/11 attacks. A month after that horrible event, we were actually hit with then the Anthrax mailings. And our primary mission is one of prevention. So, how do we prevent not only another 9/11 from happening again, but in particular, how do you stop an adversary or someone acquiring, developing, or actually using a weapon of mass destruction? I oversee programs looking at biosecurity, and really trying to ensure and prevent the misuse or exploitation of biology. Ed, come here for a second. Cross your arms, look serious. All right What do you think? Yes? Yes. So why the FBI? Why are we here today? WMD Coordinators are special agents. These are men and women that are trained in chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear, and explosive matters. There's at least one of these individuals stationed in each of our 56 field offices across the U.S. From the FBI's standpoint, we look at biology, and even the biohacker community, as very important areas of innovation, of new applications. And with that, we want to make sure that we protect that. We are meeting our mission and helping the biohacker community do their part in protecting science and safeguarding it. I want you all to think about this for a second. So what happens if you're a professor or you're a student working in a laboratory, and you observe and see something that just isn't right? Now you have somebody within the FBI. You're not calling big FBI, but you're calling, "Hey Josh. Not for nothing, but I saw this. What do you, what's your take?" So, it absolutely is a two-way street. What we've actually helped foster is a neighborhood watch mentality. Because if you think about how the community is growing, who's best-positioned to identify what's going on in their own community, but the, the members of the community themselves. Suspenseful music suspenseful music Hey. Hi. Hey. In general, FDA's authority and institutional interests lie in addressing public health risks. One question I had when I read about his self-injection is "What's the relationship between Tristan and Ascendance Bio?" When I read more about what Tristan had done, I wondered, "Is this someone who is engaging in true self-experimentation, "I've made this thing for myself and I want to see what it does to my body." Or is there some tie to commercialization or distribution? The FDA made an announcement about the self-administration of gene therapies. Any use of gene therapies in humans are subject to FDA jurisdiction, and the sale of such products for editing the genes of humans is prohibited without FDA approval. Tristan seems to have strongly-held beliefs that are driving his decisions. This is my data, this is my identity. I'm saying that this worked for me personally. And my concerns about people taking ownership over their health- One thing that worries me is just because something's dressed up in the terms of patient empowerment or consumer empowerment, and self-experimentation, does not mean that's not what it is, and does not mean there's not a commercial interest behind it. We're not concerned about the FDA. What we're concerned about is the FDA not moving in on the areas where it should have moved in decades ago. Because it's such an easy win for them, and, and such an easy win for Americans. - How are you doing? - Doing all right. We just want people to have the opportunity to have access to research compounds that they can use for self-guided and self-directed research. Deep breath. That's it. What we saw initially with Tristan was a very strong immune response for his CD4 and CD8 levels. A stronger response indicative of positive immune health than he had ever before seen in the course of his experience with HIV. As an activist, it's like I'm pushing the envelope. Why aren't we doing this, you know? If, if it does end up working, then to some degree like, it would validate this entire notion that we should have been doing this for the last two decades. There's, it's inexcusable that we've let people suffer from so many different diseases. The vaccine itself is the first application of an open access platform for gene therapy delivery that we have created. Each of our platforms can be characterized, if not open source, open access. We have our infectious disease platform, of which HIV is the first application. And we have our genetically-programmed nanorobotic platform, of which the herpes vaccine is the first application. So, the plan is for us to test out the herpes vaccine and to confirm that it is safe and effective for use as a vaccination against herpes. Electronic music So, every person that was working for Ascendance had, like, a different thing that they were passionate about. And then it got kind of sucked under the Ascendance magic money fountain. And so Andreas was very passionate about creating a vaccine against herpes. I read a lot about herpes, how it causes side effects that most people don't know. Like 90 % of the age-related blindness, spine disease, it even is involved in Alzheimer's. It just seems like a very scary virus. My goal was basically just stopping myself from getting it. We're debating whether we want to do this Yeah I know, right? - Ugh. - Uh, door. Door. So, right now, we're about this far down on our flow, flow chart of working on the, the herpes, uh, prophylactic. I talked to lots of people, and that guy was referring me to Ascendance, he said, "You know, you have this project, they have the resources, they have the money, so they could fund you. So between all these things, then you feel confident to then move to, like, a stage one clinical study with us. First you have to test it out, and then you modify the protocol, you see if it works better, test it. Yeah, do it, see how it fucks up. One step at a time, dude. Biology is really small. So if you say I totally have a thing and then you hold up a vial nobody can really look at that unless somebody else tests it. I've always been very supportive in giving people access to stuff. But it has to be very honest. This is a very experimental thing, and not safe or anything. All right. Electronic music It was so not ready. We were in the beginning of second party verification. So a month before the BDYHAX conference, I said, "Look Aaron, we might have something worth testing, but don't make a thing out of it. We could test it maybe in the hotel room with a couple of friends." And what does he do? He fucking throws a huge chunk of cash and gets his name on the banner and sponsors part of the conference. Tune in on Sunday for the first, uh, testing of the, uh, herpes live vaccine, 3:30 p.m., don't miss it. If you have herpes, you should be watching this, 'cause this vaccine is just as applicable as a cure as it is for a vaccine. He's talking about how he's going to do a live test of this thing on stage. And I'm "Dude, Andreas doesn't want to do this thing." Yeah it was really a big surprise for us. He said I've got it fixed, don't worry about it. And you know, like he's the boss. Thank you. Thank you so much for joining us today. So, we are Ascendance Biomedical. Uh, my name is Aaron Traywick, CEO, Andreas Stuermer, lead researcher, Machiavelli Davis, production specialist, uh, Walter Patterson, production specialist and Gabriel Licina, laboratory manager. This will be, uh, you know, one of the few live testings in the world of gene therapy technologies. The most important thing to know about this is that this is just the first application of an open access gene therapy delivery system. Our genetically-programmed nanorobotic technology allows the gene-thetic immunity to bind- He started talking about nano bots and then the next step is curing cancer. Again, pave the way for our work in cancer, which will be the massive breakthroughs that we really wanna see. So, without further ado, I'll be taking off my pants. Intramuscular injection is how this has to be performed. I should have just walked away. But nobody else knew how to handle the materials, and it was happening one way or another. Luckily I have herpes. I didn't get this from my momma. At that point, I'm trying to mitigate stupid. But the alternative was somebody not knowing how to handle the materials, also potentially making it more stupid. Good to go? So, there's only, like 20 micrograms in there. So, it's like really, really freaking small. So don't, like, bump it. Yeah don't worry. I'm a pro. Tense music I think it's all the way down here. Tense music Yeah, yeah. It's down. Yeah, that was it. It's just such a small amount Huh. 20 micrograms. 20 micrograms, dude. It's like nothing. Aaron's performance kind of exemplified a lot of things that we as a community agreed not to do. It's very clear to people who have worked in science for a long time that even if a project seems like it's almost done, sometimes it takes another couple years. Wow, science! Very exciting, people. When Aaron injected himself on stage at BDYHAX, I was like "This is not good." This was all of a sudden a bad actor within the community who performed bad science, in a terrible way, that was sensationalist and irresponsible. And I think all of a sudden, a bunch of heads turned. It was all showmanship. In fact, he sent a text to Andreas after the injection, going "What did I just inject myself with?" It was pretty clear that he didn't know what he was putting into his body. Informed consent wasn't there. And I think that's a crucial part of self-experimentation, is like, at the very least you need to know what, what you're putting into your body. Literally, as far as I know, the injection either didn't have anything in it, it was basically just water, or the amount of DNA that he injected was just so minute and small that there wouldn't have been any effect or anything happen anyway. There's a little drop. See the drop? Yeah, you never get everything out of it. You ask any one of those guys who were involved, all the ones on-stage with him- All right, well you already clapped, so. And we're done here, everybody go home. You ask 'em, every single one of them will give a different answer. Like, how is this gonna contribute to science in any way when you guys don't even know what he injected himself with? Next week, tune in Saturday. We'll be filming live the, uh, phase two injection of the HIV therapy phase two. This will be a 250 to 500 times higher potency than the initial safety test. Um, and following this, we will be headed to Venezuela, where we will be able to deliver this treatment to individuals who are dying currently of AIDS and HIV. This is Aaron Traywick. Disturbingly, he told us he plans to bring his drugs to AIDS patients in Venezuela. All we can do is we can say to these people we know that you don't have access to these medications. You know these people are desperate. You know these people are poor. And so you say, "Okay, these are the ideal people for us to try our untested, unregulated, potentially unsafe drug." There is no reason to believe that it isn't safe. Obviously that- There's no reason to believe that it is. Just because they're ill, just because they're dying, doesn't make them guinea pigs for your- We're not talking about them as guinea pigs. You can't even test. There's not even reagents in that country to be able to test whether or not the treatment works. All we know is if it works, they don't die. Aaron had set a deadline of producing the second version of the HIV gene therapy for February in 2018. And the idea was that we would come together, do another injection, produce it for a video. So he had invited all these different documentary crews there, at the same time with the hope that we would be testing out the next version. So not only was it not ready, but we were also dealing with this organizational meltdown at the same time. So it was definitely a media trash fire. Pulsing music One of the main things I wanted to discuss face to face when we had most of the team together in Jacksonville was to nail down some policies about open source and transparency. Gabriel was also really concerned about Aaron's use of the word "cure". We need to be very careful about, like, what we're calling these things. We set the deadline of: If you don't talk to us by the time when the second injection is supposed to happen, then we're going to have a livestream and gonna discuss our dirty laundry. The night before Tristan Roberts was supposed to inject himself with the second round of HIV therapy, we met up with the Ascendance Biomedical crew for dinner. It's like you want to make the thing so that everyone owns it and you want to own the thing. No, I want to make the thing so that everybody can benefit from it. Whatever gets it to the most people as quickly as possible and actually alleviate... Well you know the best way to get it to a lot of people? Give it away for free. And I don't think we've ever seen that open source has been able to do that over traditional marketing- Oh wow, really? Do you want to talk about Linux or- If you give everyone in the entire world access to everything that you're doing, then you leave the door wide open for unsavory and potentially negative players to take that technology and do things that can hurt themselves, and that can hurt other people, but ultimately that can hurt the field. I personally was, like, really concerned about, uh, Aaron's commitment to being open source. I was working on the website and I said, "All right, well, we need to say at what point does it become open source?" And he told me, and I quote, Open source appears to be an effective marketing strategy. And that was when I was just like, "Oh god, like, what? This guy is just, just, just making shit up." Let's say that you, let's say that your treatment works, right, for you. Mm-hmm Who then has control over that? Well, ultimately, it depends on the clinical development and how were able to partner with nonprofits, NGOs, and hospital networks around the world. He's trying to say he does. The only thing that Im saying here is that, um, it requires a lot of different partnerships outside of our group. And so... Are you going to be able to distribute it? Are you going to be the one who negotiates with the governments and the embassies and makes sure that they can actually go into the countries? I've done that before. I, I've done that. But you are assuming executive control. I've not heard any offers to get involved in those processes by anyone else. Just fun story. Um, I'll just not do lab work. We're working through it. He's like, "We're working things out." He stands up and he looks at his phone and then he just walks away from the table. Aaron did not really realize that we're anarchists and we don't really take kindly to that sort of, like, action. So the next day, I have to go to work. And I suddenly get, like, 16 text messages from Justin at the lab. They're like, "I'm outside, I'm stuck outside." Because Aaron was the signer of the lease, he showed up, and then he had someone come with a power drill, and change the locks on all the doors. Gabriel, who served as our lab manager, and Justin, who served as the laboratory technician, have been effectively, um, kicked out of the lab space, and the locks have been changed. Yesterday, when we're supposed to have the livestream, he locks us out of the lab. And this is like a microcosm of the bigger picture, right, where, like, the people who are funding it have the control over the locks, you know. They can just, like, push the researchers physically out. A big part of the mission of Ascendance Biomedical is showing that this kind of research science can happen outside of the conventional institutional structures. I have to be honest, what we've seen so far this week doesn't inspire a ton of confidence. Well, the only way that I ever want the world to see us is as a never-ending fight against these diseases. That night, I asked him, like, "Hey, do you need help?" And I'm, like, helping him, like, dump all of their personal stuff outside of the lab. And he can tell that I'm trying to be too nice to them, that I was taking their side. And that's when we had this sort of like, "And you Brutus?" Moment, where he felt hurt. And he's like, "Oh, it's because you've been friends with Gabriel longer. That's why you're taking his side." And that was just infuriating, for him to not recognize that, "No, I, I'm mad because you're not listening. You're not working through these problems. You're just ignoring them." I remember him telling me something that he had a company starting, but I couldn't understand what it was, 'cause, uh, it was just way over my head what he was, what he was saying. He asked me one time, he said, Well if you could live longer, would you, would you want to do that?" I said, "Well I don't know, it all depended on what kind of health I was in. Guess if I was in good health and could do things, yeah." He always knew that he was adopted. I mean he always heard the word adoption, so he, he, we always told him. I went to the hospital to get him, it seemed like there was a nursery full of newborn babies, and he was kind of in the middle by himself, I guess because they knew we were going to be picking him up. And he had this jet-black hair at the time, so he looked like a little orangutan. My mama always said he looked like a little old man. Then the older he got, the younger looking he got, I guess. Yeah. But he was very, very smart, very smart. He was in the gifted class. He just liked to learn. That's what set him apart, that he was so smart that other kids would pick on that. If you're smarter than everybody else, they don't like it. He was bullied at school. I would go up to the school and say, "Hey, you know. Oh no, it's just a stage he's going through, everything's okay, everything's okay." But looking back, he definitely was bullied. And I think that was one of the things that made him a little bit different from everybody else. He would come home from school and go in his room, and read his books, read his comic books. And you know, I'm sure he was depressed, too. And it just kind of scared me that he, that he wasn't going to make it. I mean I just, I don't know, I felt like something was gonna happen to him. Dissonant music Edwina, I want to hear from you. Okay. Well, I don't know where the U.S. Government's gonna get 150 billion dollars for, and I don't know, he's... Edwina Rogers, a woman with over 25 years of great experience as a professional lobbyist. Through our connections, we set about finding the chief luminaries in the field of aging research and its underlying causes and conditions. Aaron did a good job of trying to keep people separate. He didn't want us to all to be in a room talking to each other. Because I think he knew if anybody talked to me, I would warn them, I would tell them the truth. Aaron and I reached out to all the scientists we could find that were working on anything that extended the health span, or extended life. He was going around asking that they pay him on the side, and that he could, you know, get them special access. He had access to all my emails, he had access to all the websites for the three foundations. He started taking airline tickets and invitations that I would receive to give speeches. He would say things like, "Oh, no, she's not available, but she asked that I go in her place." Suspenseful music This was Aaron's bedroom. He really liked the Vishnu here because he thought that it was, uh, spiritual. As we found out later, he was using drugs. He had drugs in the house, uh, mainly cocaine. People started to complain about how aggressive he was. If we were meeting with a Congressional staffer that said, "No, we're not interested in this project, you know, we don't have any funds available for that," Uh, he would double down and start, you know, pressing them. This is the email explaining to him that because of all these problems, that we have to demote him, and that we can no longer have him in the position as a Chief Operating Officer. And then immediately a week later, we decided that we had to terminate him. Because after he got demoted, then he called the chairman and said that the problem is actually Edwina, it's not him. And he needs to be able to, uh, for people to see how brilliant he is, and he needs to report directly to the board. I'm coming home and Edwina is sitting in the car in the cul-de-sac for hours because she doesn't want to come into the house, because she doesn't want to be ambushed by Aaron, and be here in the house alone with him. Well at that point, it's like no, no, no, this dog does not hunt. We had to move him out of our house, get him out of our lives. It was unfortunate. He clearly had many of the features of psychopathy, a psychopath. People were a mark, they were to be used. He had the, the, the capacity for charisma He could turn it on and be very, uh, disarming and, uh, and winning, very apparently capable and genuine. But beneath it was predation. So, so, I do have uh, I did have serious concerns about his, his mental health. Yeah I heard there was, uh, some issues. We start shaking the tree and seeing what was there. And that's when we started talking to the early investors. And we found out that they had been promised equity. And Aaron was sort of running a shell game, where he was giving them equity in something worthless. Dissonant music He totally offered me a consulting contract, which is the same contract that he offered David Ishee, which is the same contract that he offered Mac, which is the same contract that he offered Andreas And every single one of them said 30 % of the gross profits from anything that you consult on. And that's already four people, and there were more people involved, but 30 % times four is more than 100 %. After we severed our ties, he was still going to everybody that I had introduced him to, and he wasn't telling them what had happened. For example, there was a scientist in Greece that had come up with some therapy to rejuvenate women's ovaries, so that they could possibly have a child, if they had already gone into menopause. And so he went back to that scientist and said, "Let me do your marketing and, you know, we can do some clinical trials, and we'll charge $5000." But he was keeping the $5000, you know, himself, and he was using that, uh, to live on. It was a very clear pattern. I had seen Aaron do this so many times to different people, including, you know, back to my girlfriend who had breast cancer, who was wealthy. Give me money and I'll, I'll try to get you, you know, this treatment. I mean, it's one thing to, like, take investor money uh, and run off with it. But what was really saddening was taking people who have illnesses, their money, you know. That is... To some degree, it's like, yeah, he would try to, like, fund something, but he didn't have the bandwidth, the lab didn't have the bandwidth to actually be able to, like, deliver anything in a lot of these cases. So, I think that was scamming, you know, there's no way around it. The question of false hope? Well, that's just another way of saying the experiment isn't complete yet. And we don't know if it worked or not. And of course we don't, 'cause that's why we do experiments. I said that nobody at his company was, like, a professional scientist that he was working with. He said that was a lie, and all this stuff. And I'm like, "Look man, I know everybody you work with. I've talked to them all. I know everybody who did everything, like..." Aaron was trying to sue me. I was the only individual named in the suit, me and Gizmodo Media Corporation, for $250 Million for libel. And it says stuff like, "Mr. Zayner, obviously jealous, said these things about me in an interview with The Atlantic and on Facebook." That his company wasn't working with legitimate scientists or medical doctors, which they should. It was eventually dismissed because he filed in federal court, and there was a bunch of legal things that he didn't under... understand when he filed, that the judge just threw it out because of. I saw what was happening. And I figured Aaron's a strong guy, and he is super committed to making it through anything. He had pushed away most of his friends, uh, for the sake of being completely dedicated to this business venture. And he didn't talk to his family very much. And the media portrayal of him, uh, although he was a very proud person naturally, uh, and very confident, it really destroyed him on the inside. Dissonant music Aaron Traywick, the CEO of the biohacking company Ascendance Biomedical, was found dead Sunday floating in a sensory deprivation tank in a meditation spa in Washington, D.C. Traywick and his company developed experimental gene therapies that people tested on themselves, without approval from the FDA. They actually came to my house, the police did. I just remember just feeling so panicky inside, like, oh my gosh, but I never dreamed it was gonna be that. That he was dead. Just I'm like, "What?" You know, like.. I just was... wasn't expecting that at all, just you know. It was just really bad. I was walking my dogs out behind my family's house when I heard of Aaron's death. I got a text message from someone asking, "Why is Andreas saying that Aaron is dead?" And I hadn't heard anything at that point. A lot of us were just shocked, you know. I mean he's, like, the same age as me. So that rattles your own mortality on some degree. At the same time, I think there was like a confluence of factors I think he definitely was depressed. As a mutual friend put it, "We've all been watching Aaron drown for the past few months." And I was like, "Uh, yeah, it's kind of, kind of true." The news spread, you know. Most biohackers are a decentralized community on social media. And you know, Facebook, there's all the, and internet, there's all these conspiracy theories, some people linking it to his injection, which is not possible at all. He did the injection, like, three months ago. If he was gonna have an immune reaction, it would have happened days or weeks after, not three months later. He had been cut off, or cut himself off from contact with everybody for the last four weeks. And if it was just that what he was trying to do didn't work, and he was so depressed, that killed him, that's, that's horrific. On the other far side of the spectrum, some people think it was a hit. That's similarly scary and depressing. He was a very controversial figure, in a lot of ways. So the fact that he wound up dead, especially after the collapse of Ascendance Biomedical under really unfortunate circumstances, seemed strangely timed. Part of me didn't believe it. Part of me wondered if he had been murdered. Part of me wondered if he had faked his death and escaped. There was definitely a lot of media attention following Aaron's death. I mean it was pretty much, like, straight out of a Law & Order episode. This notable figure dies under mysterious circumstances. And the more digging you do, the more you realize that a lot of people had motive behind it, not just big pharma, but also, like, all the biohackers that he had, like, misused their, like, reputations in order for his own personal gain. And then, but ultimately, it's... it's the mystery. Soft music Melanie and I went to D.C. and we went in this place. I think it was just an accident. I mean we really don't know. And it's out there that he had used ketamine but they said that there wasn't enough in his system for him to have overdosed on it. Somebody had said that he had a bruise on his forehead. And, uh, we kinda think maybe he slipped and fell back into the floatation spa. Uh, I don't know. We saw him April, April 14th. Emotional music He had his suitcase with him. He was going to the airport when he was leaving from Memphis, and he told his daddy, he said. "Everything I own is in this suitcase." He would just pick up that suitcase and go. He was my uncle, but growing up, we were really like brother and sister. Um, like, that's most of my childhood, is, um, like, me and him playing outside and, um, just me and him doing stuff. I just can't believe he's gone, really. I didn't know when he died that at the time I was Aaron's best friend. Over time, I ended up being the person that he talked to the most. And going to his funeral, meeting his family, giving his eulogy, and being inducted into the family was a really, uh, precious experience that I was not expecting. A day after Aaron violated the lease, I came up to the landlord, I'm like, "Hey man, hear you have a unit that needs to be filled." So we just, like, stepped right back into that same building. And we picked up the pieces. Ascendance didn't have intellectual property on anything. So all the people who did stuff got together and they were like, "Well, that was dumb. Let's, uh, keep doing our stuff now." We're working on plastic-eating fungus, and using directed evolution to make it so that the fungus can live in the ocean, so that it can eat ocean plastic, like the Pacific Garbage Patch. So this is the ocean water that we inoculated with Styrofoam, and the fungus. It's, like, cloudy, it's totally growing, and it's aggressive, which is good. Uh, we want it aggressive. We have aggressive problems to deal with. We're also working on a project for accelerating tree growth, so that trees, and actually anything with a cell wall, can grow twice as big, twice as fast. It's like being punk rock. Staggering around with needles and taking your pants off on stage. Like you can only get away with that shit when you're a kid. At some point, everybody's gonna have to grow up. It doesn't mean that we all need to become, like, hardcore adherents of late stage capitalism, uh, but, you know, there is something to be said for not being ridiculous all the fucking time, and, you know, trying to do something that matters. We are in sunny Los Angeles. Because after a year of going back to the drawing board, the next version of the therapy is ready. I'm pretty excited. I'm definitely ready, but at the same time, I feel a little bit more jaded and wizened since last time. How do we pivot? How do we not just have this be a sad little note in biohacking history? After Aaron's departure, there was some issue of like, "How do we raise the funds for this?" But, we've been able to secure what we need to move forward. These two get combined. This is the PI in 30 microliters. This is the DNA at one microgram at 20 microliters. There you go. Ooh, yeah perfect. Now I'm testing out this cocktail of these different substances. And once we have that, then I think we're pretty set. And we'll have to pursue clinical testing. That's 144, um, microliters. Yeah. Right. The last one. Oh, there we go. I really wish Aaron was here to see how far we've come, because I know that's what he would want to see more than anything. If we can produce the cocktail, and if it shows the results that we would expect, then we would know that the work we were doing ultimately mattered and paid off. And it would be a functional vaccine for HIV. Did it all get in there? Yes. Awesome. All in all, I don't think I'm gonna die from it, so I'm all right. I'm gonna, I'm gonna make it. Sweet. Pulsing music Throughout human history, people have been either the victims or the beneficiaries of their genes. Those genes express and they create what you are. So to be able to alter which genes you're expressing, whether that be by removing some or adding to that, totally changes the game. It allows you to become something else that be it more than what your... the lottery of life handed you. Pulsing electronic music I don't plan to be a biohacker forever and just be, like, poor, injecting myself with shit. China is really interesting because the market is huge. Maybe we'll have business here in ten years, five years. Start slowly, move into the culture, help develop biohacking as a thing in China. If anything, Aaron challenged everybody. Then people like me and other people starting to think about, like, "How can we do this safer and more effective?" It's easy to look at Aaron and choose him as a scapegoat and be like, "Oh man, he's, he's like the worst of the biohacking community." But in reality, his only fault was that he called things a cure. Otherwise, the stuff he was doing was no different than most of the other people are doing, and even probably far less harmful, and some of these people are making millions of dollars. I have a tattoo on my arm. It says, Create something beautiful. And we were gonna do all this stuff because we just wanted to do beautiful things, we just wanted to make beautiful things, and we were gonna do it just for the discovery, for our, our passion. I think biohackers are way ahead of their time, and I think they're pushing things almost to a pace that's just crazy. I'm sure we'll see a lot more people eventually in the future injecting themselves, and it actually being really, really successful. At its foundation, to me, it appears as simply freedom, morphological freedom, the freedom to be able to invent the technologies that can enhance your life, regardless of the circumstances you may have been born in, or the genetics you are predisposed to. Um, I mean ultimately that's, that's what it is, is self-guided evolution, self-directed evolution. And that is something that every individual should have the right to have. And if every individual has that right, then the collective, like humanity as a whole, benefits. And our, our culture, our world, our species is all the better for it. Well thank you again for taking the time to speak with me. Aaron, stay safe and best of luck. Absolutely. I couldn't agree more, and, uh, I was glad to do it. Thank you so very much for having me here.
