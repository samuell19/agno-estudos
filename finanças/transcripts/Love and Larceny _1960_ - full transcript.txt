Love and Larceny Sir! Thanks, very kind... - How is Madam ? - Fine, thank you. Come watch TV, this evening... Thanks... My respects to Madam. Annalisa... Happy Birthday ! Here's two apples. Hurry up, it's ready : I made truffle rice. We're making unreasonable expenses ! In reality, I only put one mushroom ! By the way, I saw a beautiful clip at the jeweller. That would be quite appropriate for the little girl of M. Oliviero. But way too expensive ! Even had some fake spangles ? Idiot ! We can't spend 15000 liras. And what if we sent him a telegram, with all our wishes for prosperity ? Ugly, old and twisted, she find herself an husband ! We're out of luck ! But you must give him a gift, It's the daughter of your boss. So he'll fire me ! It's miserable wage anyway ! But your job is secure. I know only one secure job. I put a clean tablecloth and you drop wine ! Oh well, this is good fortune. It amuse me to drop wine ! Never happy, my little darling... Your little darling was living at the Excelsior, in the apartment of Soraya ! Let's talk about this apartment ! If you don't mind ? Why does the uncle walk ? Who knows ! Today, we hesitate to spend 15000 liras. Before, I'd give them as tips ! To the lift attendant, I know. I'm saying this for you, for us... In little time, we'd be rich. All you'd only have to say is : Yes ! And all I'll tell you is : No ! Gerardo, if you love me, you have to forgive all that ! I won't live at the Excelsior neither at Soraya, neither elsewhere ! Good grace, what did I do to deserve such a woman ! It's ringing. Let it ring ! I would like to show you a piece of art. Wait ! I have my sickly mother. To go see her, I sell this candelabrum. How beautiful ! Quite beautiful. No, really. Excuse me. - Who was it ? - No one... Show me. Solid silver ! I'm in need, if not... Just look at it. What do you say ? What for ? I'm thinking for this gift. We have no idea where it's from ! Rest assured : It's the priest who gave it to me at my wedding. Yes, I'm married. I have three kids and a sick mother. Really depend of the price. We can get to an agreement. See. It's quite splendid ! It still have the original stamp. This mean nothing. Are you an expert ? Much better ! It's worth thirty thousand liras. I'll let it go for 15 and that's it ! Fifteen ? That's it : Insanity ! But it is solid silver ! OK, give me ten thousands and I let it go. Alright. You like it, we buy it and we stop arguing about it. You're getting a good deal ! Oh well, it hurt me so, but I'm in need. Oh, I regret, how awkward of me, Virgin Mary ! Excuse-me ! Excuse-me I Very good, so I'll leave. Are you in a hurry? Yes, a little... And... this candelabrum ? Which ? The gift from your priest ? It's right there. You hear... Madam is satisfied of just a package. I'm a little wary and suspicious. I want to see the candelabrum ! It's in the package. - Watch what it is ! - What's that ? Crook ! Calm down. Take out this candelabrum and put it in it's place. I must have slipped it in my pocket by mistake. Ah, there it is ! Don't take it the wrong way ! Of course not. Here's the model. This little game, we'd done it to me 50 years ago ! Now please ! The sickly mother, the substitution. Then, from 30000, you drop it to 10 ! You think I'm a kid ? Don't accuse me ! Here's your 10000 liras. And even the candelabrum ! I'm a family man. This too is a lie ! But you won't go to prison. God bless you ! No record ! Did you go to the U.S.A. ? There you may have no record, but here you do ! You don't have a trade, my friend ! Believe me... By chance, would you be from the police ? Annalisa ! He take me for a policeman ! However I know you. You're not a cop and you know all those tricks. Did we meet in jail ? Annalisa, coffee for two ! In what year were you in ? I got out in 1948... in 1952... and just now. In 1953, were you in? Me too ! - Regina Coeli ? - 3rd block. Like me. There also was Gloriapatri. If I remember ! Chinotto, you know him ! Oh yeah, he knew him. I got it : You are Gerardo, the actor ! Took you long enough ! Why don't we hear about you anymore? You made frontpage on all the newspapers ! Ask my wife ! Marriage = Prison. Just my luck, I drop at Gerardo the actor ! At another place, it would have been the same. Two sugars ? Cause you ignore your trade : As soon as you move, they catch you ! They caught you too ! Never. Me, the police, I smell them coming. They exhale the same smell of moist a cell have. You sniff it at once. And in 1953, you didn't smell it coming? In 1953, I didn't have this sense yet. I was still playing comedy. I was in search of my true artistic nature. Tourmented, hardheaded. Modestly, I wasn't missing the success. Nothing doing ! Italy have contempt for it's childrens ! Infront Gene Kelly... everyone would have applauded. To satisfy public's tastes. I came to comedy. "Darling, you please me..." Let me finish ! "I will gather for you a bouquet of stars "I'll offer it to you !" They are all friends. Say boss, give us something to drink ! Give me credit or... go to hell ! Who doesn't drink with me is against me ! Go ahead, maestro. Thanks for your kind reception. At the general demand of a friend, who stayed home. He made the right choice, this friend ! Here's another excellent imitation of my repertoire. Mime us the fish ! Coming back right away. What a success ! I warmed up the place. They whistle rather well ! Com'on, laugh, smile, encourage them ! Good luck, Annalisa... I'll have my revenge, after. You won't play anymore ! What ? And my Hitler parody ? It still works. You see... "Well, always a great success with this interpretation..." You're done for tonight. You don't appreciate it ? Let's find something else : My repertoire is quite vast. The train from Bologna, the station master. Bravo : Station master ! Change work, believe me. Tonight, you're done. And Sunday ? Difficult public : You risk having troubles. What are you saying, it's a misunderstanding They whistle, cordially ! To settle the atmosphere, they would swear... It was me ! I was quickly done ! I'm still half naked ! He still throw me out the door ! I saw... It's regretful. Tonight, they were whistling a lot ! More than usual. So, he paid for it... Yes, since forever He've been an embarassement. He's just jealous... Just envying me ! He fears my strong personality. Let's go eat pizza. You sprinkle it with salt and pepper and in 5 minutes you bring it to me. Pardon ? Well yes, with salt and pepper, it's the same. But bring it right away, I'm hungry. Don't laugh : He'll understand. Always the same joker ! M. Gerardo, Rene was looking for you. He'll come back. I'm not missing work : It's missing me ! Not recommandable, this Rene ! Why ? He's a friend. He like me, he already gave me two or three roles. I'm not hungry, I ate a toast, it filled me up. Take something anyway. To keep me company. To keep you company. Ceasar, a pizza. - A small pizza. - Me too. Two small pizzas... Two beautiful pizzas ! Let say, two normal pizzas. Yes, the dramatic repertoire gives the greatest satisfactions. That is my way. I was perfect in Shakespeare : Hamlet, Macbeth, King Lear. I must get back to it. The classics, modernized if it must. There ! I'll imitate Wanda Osiris. - You're crazy. - Why ? Cordero had such a success in Spanish! But he was, Spanish ! I have to talk to you. Hello, Rene. Pardon, one moment. - What is it ? - Do you know bolognese slang ? Just like a Bolognese ! I have a role for you. A comedy in dialect ? Almost.You say two slang words and you get 30000 liras. - You accept ? - Wait a little... Is it clean ? It's easy money : 30000 in 10 minutes ! No risk ? What risk ? You don't know nothing : Innocent ! Talk and you cash it in. Here for a start. Sorbole ! So what will you say ? "Sorbole ! Tortellini !" etc. I speak it even better than Italian ! See you tomorrow ! What did he want ? I lent him 10000 liras. He gave them back. - What is it ? - Your pizza... With the kind of hunger I have ? Bolognese Tortellini ! Did you understand ok ? Here's the pigeon. Go ahead ! Our Chief Engineer ! How you doing ? Had a good trip ? Not bad. And you, my dear Cortina ? My compliments ! A decoration without real merits. Always modest, the son of Commander Borelli ! M. Pizzolato. Very honored. Excuse me. Papa often praised you. He knows me ? I've spoken about you to his father. Let's go to the bar have a drink, Coca-Cola, beer or coffee. Coffee's life flowers, you can never refuse them. Here we can speak freely. So, this stock of fabrics, your father did agreee ? "Sorbole !" What do you think Of course he agree ! I have the papers signed here. Everything is in order.Here's the estimate. The assessment... The budget from last year. Everything is in order. Never controled. A beer ? A beer ? Three beers ! I have full confidance, but I am meddlesome. There is none more meddlesome than my father. Imagine this brave man : Each morning, at sunrise, he measure the order of the files on his desk. And not only the files ! I'll tell you an anecdote. We were with... You in a hurry... Of course, I'm in a hurry ! I went this morning to the Ministry, the Prefecture, to the Police. I mean at the Alighting Express. I take the plane for Palmi. There is no airport ! Private... He's always flying ! Here, no money. No ! Everything in due time, please. Your secretary ! She ask that you call as soon as you get to your office. Oh, yes ! Janina. - A telephone... - It's over there. Over there. Are you hurt ? I'm so sorry ! Wait, I'll clean this up. And the stamped papers ? To establish the receipts in lawful order ! No need ! Yes. The Borelli, father and son want everything to be legal, on stamped papers! Where do they sell them ? Oh, over there. I'll go, I'll leave everything here. I'll wait for you. 16 o'clock 23... You asked me ? 16 o'clock 23... Mister Bianchi ? Figure it out for yourself. From Bologna, just like me ? Yes, not far. You're nice. Here ! Where is Lallo ? M. Cortina is gone ? He went to buy the stamped paper. He insisted. Watch those samples. At this moment, I start hearing a strange music, increasing, A sort of coucou, like when you realize you've been swindled. How much was there ? 3 millions. I've learned in court. If I ever find this Cortina... 3 millions, he usurped me ! You'll find him : The Ways of the Lord are limitless. You're new here ? It's the first time. Gerardo Latini, actor, since childhood... What is it ? - Sardine oil. - On your head ? It tonic. You'll stain the bed. It's yours. You were saying ? I began with my father : Following in his footsteps. Same as me. I came here on Thursday to see the old man. Family tradition ! And why are you here ? Always the same thing, they talked, they call it a swindle. - Calumny ? - No, it's the truth ! Understood. And the atmosphere is good ? You can rest easy. Pardon, a misplaced hair. You're a nice guy ! There's only good people. Also, some personalities. I'll do it. Here's our friends. Catania, Gloriapatri, I present you my friend, an artist from the scene. Gloriapatri, the ace of the clergy swingle. A fine trade. Back then ! Now there's too many. - You're an artist ? - Modestly. - Comedy or tragedy ? - Everything... Give us a sample. Friends, an artist is among us encourage him! Come on here ! It was a difficult public, but they couldn't leave. I attacked with the finest of my repertoire : The tirade of Antony, in Shakespeare. "Friends, Romans, Countrymen !" Me, born in Zagarolo. Miseducated ! "I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. "The noble Brutus, Hath told you Caesar was ambitious... "If it were so, it was a grievous fault, "And grievously hath Caesar. "Answer'd it "Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest,- For Brutus is an honourable man; "So are they all, all honorable men,- "Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral. Who's dead ? One of his friends. "Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill. Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? "But Brutus says he was ambitious; And Brutus is an honourable man. "He hath brought many captives home to Rome, "Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill: Did this in Caesar seem ambitious? "When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:" Your wife is in the visiting room . I'm not here ! "And none so poor to do him reverence. "O masters, if I were disposed to stir Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage, You sure look funny, you ! "I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts: I am no orator, as Brutus is; "For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth, "Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech, You're ruining the effect ! "I tell you that which you yourselves do know; "Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, "poor dumb mouths, "And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, "there were an Antony Would ruffle up your spirits, "and put a tongue In every wound of Caesar, "that should move "The stones of Rome "to rise and mutiny." I'm done. This Brutus was a real bastard. I improvised. I even restrained myself. But I know how to be more agressive. Good technique. What will you do, after ? I'd love to join together a few good elements. Do you want us three ? Are you a comedian ? You should see him interpreting a priest. It's a different style To each his own. No, listen to me : Prison gives you ideas. In a month, it's amnesty. Let's keep in touch Pleasure, Stabat Mater. No. Gloriapatri. Hello. Don't let anyone come out. Hello, artist ! Send us a postcard ! Come back, will keep your place warm ! At the theatre, I was looking for Annalisa : She was on tour, in the south of Italy, in Bari. To join her, I would have to find the money to travel. 10000 liras. At the artist's restaurant, I had friends. Some owed me money : Could they refuse me ? Indeed”. How you doing ? Gerardo ! Been a year we haven't seen you. I was on tour in Switzerland. In Switzerland ? How was it ? Hospitable country, higher civilization, strong currency. And the women... The Women! They love the Italian man, they run after him ! Different mindset ! Nordic manners. No prejudice. Do they eat cream salad ? Ignorant ! We eat a la carte : International cuisine ! You can't understand ! Tell me. I'm flat broke ! You're all deadbeats! Deadbeats! - Where did he go ? - In jail ! Lend me 10000 liras. Where will I take them ? Don't scream ! Give me credit tonight. - It's not a good time ! - Don't you trust me ? I have 34 credit accounts and the boss deduce them from my salary. I am not Don Bosco ! You're a skinflint, a niggard ! True friends, we only find them in prison. Chinotto told me : Remember that my house is always open. Won't need more to eat for six than we do for seven. De Rosa is here ? Chinotto ? Pappa won't be here, not today, not tomorrow. - What you want of him ? - Nothing, nothing... Passing by, I was telling myself... No matter. There's no one. Go see grandma, you annoy me ! Without the uniform you're unrecognizable ! What's in your head : Sardine oil ? No, it's French hair wax! Better than sardine ! My friend Gerardo. I meet him... Where could you have meet him ? At Capri ? My wife... The grandma doesn't say anything : She's deaf-mute ! Come in, let's talk business. - You eat with us ! - I don't want to bother... - An aperitif ? - Can't refuse it. - Come to the living room. - There is another room ? No, it's right here. Sit, get confortable. Did you think about my proposition ? I'm thinking... Listen : You, with your physique, me, with my intelligence. We could make a fortune ! You will be able to afford a home like this one : Antique furtinute, of great value. M. Gerardo, will you excuse me, I took you for a policeman ! You heard ? They won't arrest you no more ! Cheers ! Cheers, madam. She's deaf as a post. To your future ! Better yet, to our association. And so I became allied with Chinotto. In fact, it was like playing comedy. Interpreting a new character at each turns: It was an art ! Those shoes are elegant double bottom, hand sewed. - 14000 Iiras. - It's cheap ! Let's look in the mirror. They suit you to charm.

How much does this cost ? 20 liras. I wouldn't want to be in his place when he catch him! Me either. We're not only making a living out of shoes. And the tomatoes were too much of a reminder of my actor's career. At Christmas, we moved to a more profitable activity... and absolutely legal. Chinotto was an authentic son of a convict. I wasn't, but was it my fault ? In there. Thank you, children. No panic. Thank you for the prisoners. A little latecomer 50 Iiras only. Ask a little more to your mamma ! Let's leave, Chinotto ! We never rest. We even worked at breakfast hour. Desert ? Saint-honoré cake ? No, bring me a coffee and the bill. Attilio, help me. Bring him. Music, music ! It's nothing, just feeble, it will pass. Those awful mushrooms ! No ! Milk give me nausea. Bring me to the hospital ! I want to see mamma ! Jean, Joseph, Pascal, my children. It's your fault ! But I controled the mushrooms. Controled. Dear God, he's dying ! I want a priest. A priest ! Who's calling a doctor ? I, doctor ! Show patient. Quickly ! No lose head. Me, examine. Unhook: First precaution ! These mushrooms are poisonous ?

Explain to me by gesticulations, language Latin. Precision : You offer money, yes... A lot. A lot, no. A fair amount. Autority will décide fair. I love the Polish. Don't talk with your hands. A poison, your damned pills ! Who gave them to you ? The veterinarian ! The pharmacist, really ! Suffer quietly : I'm counting. I want the priest and mamma And my childrens... I want the priest ! Chinotto was sick for 8 days. Not to feel idle, I interpreted my first great role. I would like some cakes. - How many ? - I would need... thirty-six. An assortment ? Yes. With a dozen on the side. 12 on one side, 24 on the other. There : 36 for 30, fair and square, I have the exact sum. Can you keep everything I'm coming right back. Pardon, how much for this ring, in the glass window ? Which one ? The one with the brilliances. The price only, cause if it's too expensive. It's a deal : 40000 Iiras. Are you looking for something cheaper ? - This one cost 27000 liras. - Still too much ! A beautiful gem ! It's worth twice as much at the jeweller. I know. Is it for your bride ? You'll be quite successful. Really, I can't, I'm a working man. It's a beauty ! For 24000, you let it go ? But I can't... So, twenty-four, twenty-five ? Alright, because it is you. OK. Do you know the bakers there ? Madam Turchini ? She owe me 36000 liras for a repair. She'll pay me tomorrow, she didn't have the change. OK, see you tomorrow. No, the ring, I must offer it today. It's her birthday. Tell me, what is your name ? M. Augusta, how very pretty ! Remind me of pappa. So, the baker will refund you. Come with me. 24 out of the 36, You'll give them to M. Augusta. I'll take the rest late. I'll bring them right away. No need to hurry ! Fine. You see ? It's in order. Wait, don't you want a box ? No, I'm in a hurry, it's perfect. Thanks and see you. Young man, you can't park here. I've seen. I stayed just a minute. Are you from the country ? Of course ! Catania. I swear, just a minute ? You have my word As a Sicilian ! So leave quickly my friend. Say hello to the people ! It was my first romantic exploit. Annalisa returned, I offered her the ring of 18 cakes. Pardon, of 18 carats. Splendid ! That's outrageous. Nah, it's nothing ! With a gem that big ? Seems almost real. It's a fake : 3000 liras. And you offer me a fake ? You are never happy : It's either too much or not enought ! Give it back and let's leave it at that. Listen... I like honesty. What have you done during all this time ? I worked. Renew my reportoire ! I play all the roles : I have a good company. What is this "good" company ? You know Maestro De Rosa. Maestro ? He's named Chinotto : Condemned for swindling. I'm informed. My God, what loudmouth in this surrounding, so careless ! Gerardo, what if you were working... as a salesman ? Working, in what sense ? Do you want to marry me, yes or no ? Watch Pulcinella... Cute ! Adorable ! If you don't want to marry me, say it ! Of course I want ! Not right now. Watch Pulcinella. They're stunning the devil. We'll have children. Surely. So what ? I don't want to tell my son : Your father is in prison. Stop being an idiot, or else... Why explain everything to the children? They are little. No need to say anything. Do you think I can find work so easily? I have the friend of my father who owns a market. He'll help us. You see, one of these days... Not one of these days : Tomorrow. - Tomorrow ? - Yes, of course, you don't laugh anymore ? Watch, The devil stun Pulcinella ! Annalisa forced me to this friend of her father. I had the impression of going to the dentist with my mother. So many young people are sad when they are told : "We're not hiring. Come again at another time". I was sad at the opposite. You'll start tomorrow. Thank you. I'm really lucky ! Naturelly, you will be hired on a trial basis. You will earn... 30000 liras. Per month ? You hear, Annalisa : Per month ! Oh sorry, can we glue it back ? I dropped it. Because you are introduced by the daughter of a friend, your wage could increase : Forty, fifty. Always per month ? Annalisa, It's unhoped for! A benefactor. What did I do ? This do break, if you make it drop ! I am a little nervous... It's a delicate work. It require a lot of attention ! The raise depend on your output. Do you have a tic ? No, why ? Would I have a tic ? No, not that I know ! Well, as we say in Naples : No one is born a scientist. Considering how I value your father... No ! With you, I will go bankrupt in 3 days ! Is it my fault ?

Pay 20000 liras, all included. I will see your commander and I'll have you revoked Then, I will charge. And I will make a report. If you knew who I was, you'd give up. Et toi, Si Tu savais qui je suis... With the fines, I offered myself a car. I was working in Milan. Great city, Milan ! "Who disavows Milan, refuses it's bread !" Chinotto, watch. Lallo Cortina ! The one that swindle you ! Lallo seemed idle and, in our trade, It's a sign that we're working hard. The chewing-gum, the girl taking cover : A jeweler not far away. - Wait here. - Where you going ? I'll try to possess him. Hold the girl, by all means. No doubt : Lallo was playing a game known to all, except the jewellers ! Those are high quality jewels, but I can show you even better. Do you like this necklace ? - How much ? - 8 millions. No, that's excessive. It's difficult these days to find a woman that is worth 8 millions. Everything depend on the lady... A gem is missing ! A gem worth 2 millions. And you tell this to me ? You and me, we're alone, understand me. So you suspect me ? No ! No ! You suspect me ! Go call the police ! I want to get at the bottom of this ! Search me... Undress me ! See me naked ! So I undress here ? Where, then ? Miss, call the police ! We'll see me naked ! Are you one-eyed ? I am confused. Watch what you've done ! Now, we must remove the stain. I will do it. Let me do it ! It's just a little coffee. - Don't leave like, my pretty one ! - I'll get it cleaned. Milk ! - No milk ! - I will pay. I must go. Listen, wait ! It's stained ! Let me go or I'll bite ! One moment ! Don't go out with this stain ! It's mostly on the back ! You desire something ? A bracelet for a watch. - Did we help you ? - Yes, someone's helped already. Excuse-me. I was the victim of a theft. Important ? Yes. A gem of 2 millions. Thanks a lot. - This one, how much ? - 800 liras. Here. A serious house would not allow itself... Be indulgent : The evidence. The evidence is that I do not have this gem ! Learn how to distinguish a client from a thief ! I swear I won't ever set foot again in this place ! Is that understood ? Let me go ! Will you leave me alone ? Mamma Mia ! He is crazy ! Leave me be... Go away ! Finally you're here ! She hit pretty hard. So you did your trick ? What trick ? I earned 2 millions. You like it ? So we share. What ? It's a gift ! It wasn't there ? Poor thing, I'm not a sap ! Maybe. I searched everywhere, I'd have found it ! It was there. Only an idiot like you couldn't see it. The idiot is you. Where did you stick it? On the right side, under the counter : I told you so. - You deserve to be slapped ! - Try if you dare ! Don't hold it against me. But we don't treat a pretty woman that way. What do you want ? The Miss is right The gem was not there ! What gem ? Pardon, who are you ? Come on, remember: the son of the bolognese industrialist... The meeting at the station, the 3 millions briefcase. You remember? The station... The friend of René ? Bravo ! The friend René, exactly ! Excuse me, let me introduce myself, Gerardo Latini. But simply call me Gerardo. But this gem ? I told you it wasn't where you left it. Why ? Because it's the son of the bolognese industrialist who took it, the friend of Rene, or better yet, the undersigned. How did you do it ? Remember our pact : Never to ask questions ! So, do not ask any questions. The gem, I have it, I keep it. It's theft ! Not, a weak compensation for my 4 months in prison... 4 months that I done because of you ! Alright ? If not, we go to the police make a report. No police. No report. With types like you, I don't even want to soil my hands! Not even ! Helena, allons... You're coming ? A lot of things ! My respects... You were talking of prison. Futilities! In life, we need experiences. Do you know what prison is ? In reality, not yet. But my father knew. Clean slate ! See you this evening? The friends of my enemies are my friends. Gerardo Latini. In life, to each his destiny. I've only known crooks. I saw the first one at birth. He was there, smiling. Who was it ? My father. And as girls resemble their father, I lived from swindles. And you mother ? It was worst. But still, I would love to meet a fine man, even a stranger that would offer me a different life. Well, you've found him ! I am not a stranger... But honest, in all modesty ! By the way, darling, how much does Cortina owe you ? 45 % of the benefits. With me, you'll have to contend with... 30% my love. Let say 40 %, precious ? Alright, babe... 35 %. I wasn't easy to get rid of a friend whom, beyond this, consider himself your maestro. Even with diplomacy, it was like saying : I don't need you no more. Henceforth, I will work with Helena. good-bye ! Are you leaving ? My best wishes be with you ! But you could have been honest, instead of taking French leave. Are you making a scene ? Would you think ! We're not married. All my wishes.. What should I say to Annalisa ? That I'm doing well.. Turn off the light and pay your due ! Helena had the merits of a woman we do not love... Pretty, without prejudice, no a worry with wedding. And my work was finally bring me success ! They were starting to applaud ! Did you read the paper : "Daring scam at a Milanese furrier. "A stranger calling him Bazzoni the industrialist "paid by cheque 2 furs of 6 millions." That skinflint, to buy 6 millions in furs ! Ain't that funny, and if the cheque had been paid ! The guy is very good. 6 millions, it's a lot ! To swindle your next of kin, you need : Precision, cold blood and psychology ! He's a genius... an artist ! In out line of work, he was one of a kind !

Businessman ? Yes. Rebuschini : Wines, oils, pastas. Allow me, here's my card. Thank you. Here's mine. We'll see one another again. I travel a lot, so we'll become old friends. See you soon, my friend. I will send you the project. And rest easy, I tell you... The deal is for you, ok You're quite sympathetic to me. Gerardo ! I got your word from jail. Here I am. What a lovely overcoat ! - What are you doing ? Are you insane ! - Insane ? Didn't you write me ! And you come here ! I was studying an affair : You wreck everything ! Ours is of great importance. I spotted the corner... - You've found the church ? - Yes. No familiarity Here, my good man. Peace be with you ! By the way, I must buy... the stole... ...move the bicycle from my aunt, ...get myself shaved and order some flowers. All this misery ! Life's hard ! And I got to eat... For the bride ? I took the measurement on one of her rings. So here's for the two rings. Splendid, my compliments ! A connoisseur choice, it's quite beautiful ! Quite expensive, too. Still, one must hold his promises. Maybe you don't believe in happiness ? Before, I too was sceptical. But when Anne, my bride, was close to... A lethargic encephalitis... But let's change subject ! I promised the Madonna a great gesture once she heal. You can't understand. I understand you, sir. I too had a dear friend who was greatly afflicted. What's the day ? Saturday 28. Here's for you : 2 millions 750 thousands. What should I engrave ? Our two first names, Anna and Stephano. And the wedding date. Will you deliver on time, tomorrow morning ? It's important ! I will go myself to the church of the Capucines... quite out of sight, that church ! Well, I hate publicity. I forgot. After the ceremony, we will receive at the Excelsior. Intimate reunion, between friends. Do you want to join us ? Too kind. I'm flattered. Wedding in full dress tails ? No ! I had to argue against my inlaws, but I won. Too bad, I never wear tails. Just come in tails then ! Good bye. See you tomorrow. And thanks for chosing us ! Stephano Loy, do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife? Anna Romani, according to the rite of our Holy... Shut up ! ...the Catholic Church ? Anna Romani, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband... - Your name ? - ...Stephano Loy, according to the rite of the Catholic Church ? "Ego conjungo vos in matrimonio, in nomine..." My God, are you ugly! - My best wishes. - Thank you. Thanks, friends. Come, M. Wurstel... Here, Father, my modest offering to the Madonna. Very well, my son. What a splendor ! In my church, so very poor, a jewel so precious ! It's the intention that count... Exact ! "Et pauperi porrige manum tuam ut perficiatur..." My dear, let's leave ! Common, dear. Our will is accomplished. Excuse me. This jewel was paid by cheque. I will cash it tomorrow. I'm not worried, especially with M. Loy. But it's our job, we never know. I understand, don't fear, my son. The jewel stays here, and will be guarded by the Madonna. If ever you have any troubles, you come back. Give Caesar What Belongs to Caesar. Anna. My daughter. Don't cry ! Go away ! Ah, those mothers... Beautiful wedding, was it not ? Are you motorized ? Yes. May I bring back anyone ? No, thanks. We shall meet at the Excelsior. Father, hurry! Father. Hurry up! Isn't this church unused? Naturally, only the jeweler went to the Excelsior. We went to Rome. I wanted to see my ex-professor and friend again... Pappa's here ? Pappa won't be here, not today, not tomorrow. It really was true. He was waiting for amnesty. However frequent they are here. So I decided to help his wife; who refused, to my surprise. Discrete, I couldn't tell him that my money, like his, came from the Bank of Vices ! I left the sum to the son of the previous amnesty. He was 6 years old : The age of his first college fund. I search for a man, I look for an husband... I dream of a man, of a lover too. I want him virile, gorgeous, strong and bold ! I search for a man, I look for a beautiful love. I want a man, yes, yes ! Who understand me and who's more rich than Ali ! I'm looking for a young man but... No matter the age. If he offer me happiness ! You leaving ? If I displease you, see the dancers In my opinion, It's the operator he likes! I want a man, yes, yes ! Who understand me and who's more rich than Ali ! I'm looking for a young man but... No matter the age. If he offer me happiness ! Oh the beautiful car ! You see this, Annalisa ? Who it belong to ? To the Shah of Persia ? Please. - Hello, Isoline. - Ah, you're back. I was traveling away. I wouldn't want to disturb you. But to eat alone makes me uneasy. Better alone than badly accompanied. That's right. But this boy's here, we can't throw him out. Show yourself a little. A beautiful specimen. Stay put. Who's this? You know him? By sight. He's going. But careful with your golden watch, darling. Ah, little kisses... You're spending for this microbe. Stay calm ! He's nervous and fidgets ! Calm down. Drink a little. So, tell me, are we getting married ? We will get married. And you love him, this washout ? He offer me what I want : A home, kids... He even knows how to make kids ? Complete, perfect ! Let see... Stomach acidity, light myopia : Accountant ! All dressed up. Your elbow ? Leave ! We wish to be alone ! Too bad! I had brought a small present. Lower your paws, accountant ! Look, we're asking for you. Spiritual! Take it as a wedding gift! - No, give it to another ! - Alright. My hat. Of course, I'll give it to another! That's not too difficult. Gemma, do you want it, this little fur ? Here. Wait a second. That's your last word ? A pizza ! Bon Appetitto ! Here. Tell Gemma I'll take back the fur tomorrow. I can't wait to take you away from this milieu ! And so do I! Don't worry about it : 3 or 4 years from now... 3 or 4 years ? You told me come spring ! Yes, but by both keeping on working for some times, we will have our house. Here. I made the maths. You made them without me ! Yes, I did it all alone. You, give me back this coat ! It's mine ! Show how little you know him, cutie Not the slightest. As expected, between the fur and the accountant with the face of a cretin, Annalisa chose the fur. Certain that she'd return to me, I started working again. Egg pastas ? Again '3 Is it here ? No! You are calling the General Mesci. You swear that your friend, the general Mesci, have saved me the merchandise ? Not at all ! Ge-Ge, I mean the general, Told me that this offer is beneficial for aviation... It is ! And your general is fully aware that Mr Galvani, who own the market until now, had the pastas sold 1234 liras the case, only that ! As for myself, the same case, I sell it, 1225 liras. With the difference that instead of soft wheat pastas, I give egg pastes ! No one is honest ! And the army would save millions ! And you would make one hell of a deal. You are keen ! But I do not fool around. By the way, tell me. Tell. The general Mesci, is he in love with you ? How dare you ? What do you take me for ? Our love, sadly, is without hope. Ge-Ge is married. Please Miss, be honest Is it to say ? It's a great business opportunity... I do not understand. You understand me quite well I think! A man in love refuse nothing ! I have the experience. So many concessions I made for Doris, my ex-girlfriend. This bracelet, do you remember ? If the general Mesci let me have the market, it is yours. Not bad. Not bad ? I paid it 2 millions, cash ! Doris had great fortune, when she worn it. And now ? The idiot prefered an operetta general ! But, I took back everything... even her clothes ! Too bad for her. So, Miss, will we "collaborate". General, a worker from the telephone company. Good. Call Madam. Pardon, my general. The head office indicate that your number is having problems. - That's right - May I have a look ? Please. I was going to call you. Since this morning, they ask us for egg pastas ! Must be the selector. Allow me to check your phone. It always worked well. How many do you have ? One in the bedroom. Four total. It's too many. We'll have to change the relay, the line is overloaded. Of course! Your son even asked for one close to his bed. It's your son too. I'll call the head office. Here, Rebuschini Adolpho. I am at General Mesci. What ? The line is failing at an egg pastas salesman too ? OK, call me back. I'm hanging up. Here's our slave labourer, who got a phone connected close to his bed ! Not even able to rise up anymore ! He must save his energy. - What time is it ? - 16 h 25. Ge-Ge must have finished his siesta. Call him. I don't know him... Can't be me. There's his wife... Ask to talk to him, I'll do the rest. Wait a moment. General Mesci. Speaking ? Here, Rebuschini. Excuse, my general. One of our common friend. Miss Lattanzi talk to you about me, for the merchandise. Yes, egg pastas. Mr. Frassinelli, the director. OK. Tomorrow, 9 o'clock, I'm at the office and I'll prepare the proposal for the merchandise. In the name of Rebuschini, for the general Mesci. Please, Ge-Ge, try and help him. You'd do me a personal favor. Thank you, Excellence. Yes, tomorrow, 9:00, at the Ministry. See you tomorrow, my general. You see ? It's done. So, I'll take care of everything. Also yes, it's the Administration. For a relay, you need official papers. I'll have you sign them tomorrow. OK, be as quick as possible. If I want, tomorrow morning. But do not worry, Rebuschini's will take care of it. And you... tell me... - You... - What do you want ? You know me ? No, I'm saying... This costume, you bought it ? It look good ! Do you think they give them to us ? Could we have some ? Of course. The day you decide to work, you'll have one. Ain't it so, my general ? Bravo, Rebuschini ! What should I give to the general ? Nothing, never ! Make a donation to Father Gerardo instead... Who is it ? He's in charge of the assistance to needy families of aviators. Ge-Ge hold him in high regard. I'll give whatever you say. How much ? A supplier once gave 5 millions. Greedy, this Gerardo ! Rubber-cheque ! Mines are always good. Undoubtedly. But considering the precedent, take my tip. Tomorrow, bring cash... You will be welcome. For me, it's all the same. But I want a signed paper. I am wary even of generals. That's fair, but Ge-Ge is not a general like any others. Goodbye and thanks again. I got her good ! Where are you going ? I'll go steal the plans for the atom bomb. Common, don't you see. I'm here for a repair. Hello aviator ! Half turn, right ! - Where's the WC ? - There. - Where you going ? - General Mesci is waiting. - Your name ? - Rebuschini, Adolpho. One moment. Mr. Rebuschini, for general Mesci. I'll ask. A man named Rebuschini ask for you. That must be for my cursed phone. Let him in. Let him in. Stay here. In my office, I have a cabinet counsil. You know the lady Lattanzi ? I meet her in the train. She was with... 7th squadron ? El Alamein ? Excuse-me. It is your intention to... I told you yesterday on the phone: The merchandise. I know. But I ask, if you are willing to make your fortune out of the army's funds. Don't believe that ! I only want to make myself useful, do my part. Help the Nation, the Fatherland. No blasphemy ! The Fatherland, we trade it away like plankton in front of a can of gasoline. But we must keep this can, not steal it ! Is that clear ? Did you inquire on Rebuschini ? Nothing to signal ? That ease my mind ! Eh... pardon me ? Don't act so surprised ! Inquire, move ! I am careful. I always inquire. I'm not worried the slightest. I'm less expensive than Galvani and I add eggs ! Don't tell me about this Galvini ! If it only depended on me... he'd be in front the firing squad. I even suggested it. I ignored the general was here. And Rebuschini, where did he go ? We didn't see him Helly, where is Rebuschini ? OK, go look for him. General Mesci wait for Mr. Rebuschini. Where is he ? - I've no clue. - Go find him, quick ! Here's your paper, giving you access to the supply. Will that be sufficient ? My word would be sufficient ! Everything is in order : Signature, headed notepapers. Only the seal from the Administration is missing. Don't move, I'll take care of it. Dear Frustaci, give me the seal. Well, but of course, my general. Thank you, dear Frustaci and goodbye ! - Here. - Already done ! Italian bureaucracy isn't as slow as it's said to be. Thank you, my general. Don't thank me, do your duty. My duty, without a doubt, my general... Miss Lattanzi have suggested... That I bring a small donation for Father Gerardo. Perfect! The benefactors of Father Gerardo are our own! 5 millions... I do not wish to know. It's the gesture that count. You do not wish to check. I've full confidence in you ! Wait for me, I'll get a receipt for you. That won't be necessary. Shush ! I know what's needed. Don't move. Douglas B 29... The very best ! Haven't they been removed ! I restored their unit, you fool! - Mr. Rebuschini ! - It's me. - What are you doing ? - I'm waiting for general Mesci... - He's waiting for you in his office. - He told me to wait for him. Counter-order, come with me. We install the phone here ? Yes. Why ? My general, Mr. Rebuschini... Come on in. That's not you. What ? I must speak with general Mesci. Where is he ? The general, that's me. You ? Who was I talking to earlier ? I ask you ! I was waiting for a simple worker from the phone company. I want to get at the bottom of this ! I even have the authorization for the egg pastas. Again with those egg pastas ! And I gave 5 millions, a bundle ! For Father Gerardo. Father Gerardo ? Who is this ? Special Edition ! A daring swindle at the Ministry of Defense. A general under suspicion. Special Edition. The scandal of the Generals. The crisis of the Government. Good evening doctor. Have you read ? What kind of world we live in ! The article on the crook lacked humour and psychology. Worst yet, I was described as a vulgar little grifter ! The journalist didn't have any talent ! But I reconciled myself quickly with the Press. In our trade, any event can suggest a great idea. Stupid jerk ! Follow that car... Here we are. Fortunately, I couldn't take it anymore. Let's stay here. Where's out Greta Garbo ? She's here. Lying ! If she see you, we're finished. I know... - From here, we can't get a good angle. - She only need to be recognizable. How tall is she ! And that interest people, Greta Garbo ? Don't you worry, just take your pictures ! What, she's crazy ! She's not bad at all... Yes, we could mistake her for a man ! I'm talking about the secretary ! She didn't come cheap... 2 millions, she took us ! But if Greta knew her secretary sold her, she would destroy her ! I do think... italian sea is extremely maritime ! Who is it ? What's she doing ? But who is it ? I'll give you back your fur, it may prove useful to you. Wait, Annalisa ! Let follow them ! Slowly, I have heels, damn ! You made everything fail ! I regret not bringing the police with me ! Calm down ! You can talk after. Stop ! Divine, stop ! Greta my dear, don't go ! The Divine got annoyed and... good-bye ! Nando, let's go photograph the whale. My God, what a race! I'm still shaking all over. I even broke my heel on the rocks when we were fleeing. I was so scared ! And the reporters with their eyes wide open. But who sent her here ? Who is she ? Miss Annalisa... Helena... I do not wish to know. And me either ! Please, be good ! A cigarrette. Don't play dumb ! And you dress as a woman ? I was coming to tell you it was over with my accountant. Now I changed my mind. I'll marry him. And I'll scratch you ! Accountants, they give me nausea ! The crooks amuse you ? Listen, there is nothing between me and Helena, just a working relationship. She can say it ! We are associates, for 35 %. - That's it. - Yes, I know you ! Common, drive. Annalisa, you know I love you and that I've always did ! Annalisa, I... I love you with all my heart ! Bastard ! Shut up ! Where are you going ? I feel like walking a little. I'll take the bus... And the 2 millions in advance from the Agency ? Didn't see them ! They didn't give me a penny. They told me, after the report. So, the downpayment, after ? You owe me ! I owe you nothing, I don't have a penny. How else can I tell you ? Let it go... Good-bye money ! And now, salutations ! Stop ! Sit please. I must go to the bank before it close. Certainly. Pappa won't be here, not today, not tomorrow. Chinotto's still in prison ? Yes... For you, business as usual. And you, prettier each times I see you. I brought you... - May I come in ? - Yes, come. - Coming in ? - Go right ahead, I'll be over right away. I was helping the family of Chinotto this way... who, despite the amnesties, was still rotting in jail ! Finally, I realised he was only rotting away in a closet. You came once again. How to thank you? For a year now, we live thanks to you. Today, I was only bringing news. I'm going through a difficult patch. And Chinotto... Still in prison. For how long ? Maybe 2 or 3 months. How does he hold on locked up ? I wonder too. He told me to pass his salutations and to thank you. It's me who thank him ! Too bad ! I had a good proposition. I'll look for someone else, Gloriapatri... You were talking of a proposition. What is it about ? I'll explain to you, sit confortably, Bring two glasses. So you were locked up ? I was resting. Enough sleeping. We have work to do ! We get back together ! But I'll deduce what you stole from me. You can laugh, you'll see ! You speak English ? You will make progress. I understood, you practice. The first deal is with Gloriapatri. Will you support us? Why were you in the closet ? I like it in there... Let's bury the past ! To our association ! To our future... I reserved the usual table. My friend, how you doing ? - Who's that? - An industrialist. I got myself all the way up the social scale. I attended the night clubs. Exotic rhythms captivated me 10000 liras to bring us here ! Did you saw what you gave him only to find us a seat? - Money is meant to be spent. - Yes, other people's money ! What a delicious pair of legs. Always so fine ! Friends in prison ? Error. A deputy, the general director of a large company. And they say hello ? Relations... Granted services. Will you still continue this life you have for long ? I want to rest easy, if I get married ! Come dance. Why do you change the subject? Trust me, darling, give me some time. Two and three things and I'll fall in line. For you, I gave up Helena : I'm missing a partner now. And Chinotto ? It's a marriage : You see me wed Chinotto ? Oh, do we know each others ! I seen you before... but where ? I wouldn't know... Biarritz, Monte-Carlo... Businessman ? In a way. Me too. Rebuschini : Wines, oils and egg pastas. Here's my card. One of these days, we never know. You were saying you needed a partner. Yes. You know someone ? Maybe I have an idea... Her idea was to become, herself, my partner... It was a reversal, a conversion! You're pretty... Very pretty ! No, I can't take it no more. I'll tell him everything ! Are you kidding! No childishness. You had to think of this beforehand. You convince me to cheat my only friend and now you're remorseful ! You are crazy ! Here he come. - Laura, keep her calm. - Don't worry. When he knows that the wedding is real, what will he do ? What all husbands do : He will resign himself. - Gloriapatri's not here ? - He's in prison. He wanted to bless a home where a priest already been. They caught him ! - And us then ? - I have one you'd swear is real ! - Sure ? - Very sure ! - Where you've known him ? - At church, evidently ! You're laughing, that's idiotic. You put makeup on... That ain't new ! Annalisa, your husband... I'd almost take his hand! Let's go. I have the diadem here... Splendid... Yes, after the ceremony. Odd looking face ! Where'd you get him ? Hope he's quick so they can arrest him ! Nervous? Early on, it's normal. Then we get used to it. He's worthless ! He drop everything ! He's too tall ! Gloriapatri was more dynamic. This one is just too fake ! That sounds bad, nobody believes it ! Gerardo Latini, Do You Take This Woman Anna Rauseo... To Be Your Lawfully Wedded Wife according to the rite of the Holy Church ? Anna Rauseo, Do You Take This Man... Our real names ? Who cares. It's all fake ! What is he doing ? "Ego conjungo vos in matrimonio, in nomine Patris, "Filii et Spiritus Sancti, amen..." What is he doing ? My dear children, you have claimed here, in front of this church... Your love and allegiance... Cut it short, please... Father, I brought you a modest present. How beautiful ! But make it so this donation is not in vain. Vivify it with prayers. Why you laughing ? What matter, Father, you know, Is the intention we offer it with. Anna, your will is done. What he's leaving ? And he give us the necklace ? He have confidance. Confidance ? What's going on, Annalisa ? Gerardo, the wedding is real. I am your wife. How come ? Everything is real ! Here's pappa and mamma. And also our friends. Only the necklace is fake.. We got an agreement with the jeweler. Best wishes. Wait, I want to understand... Are you real or not ? You are saying, my son ? Here ! In life, you shouldn't ever trust anyone ! We think we meet an angel and one day, the angel say : "I am your master..." Oh yeah ! And we think we meet a friend and he tell you : "I am the police chief !" That also could happen... but not to me ! The police, I smell them coming So you must have a cold ! Police Chief Santini. You've been caught like a beginner ! Why ? What did I say ? It was all lies ! Isn't it, Annalisa ? Nothing's for real ! What's going on ? It's Police Chief Santini... From the district. Pleased. Would be wise to stay calm, to avoid shackles. The shackles ? It's an error on the person, tell him, Annalisa ! I'm an office clerk. My husband is honest now I had him change life. I watch over him "We" will watch over him better. Say goodbye to your wife. - Let me get dressed. - Yes, but make it quick. This had to end that way. Are you happy now ! Why did you have to brag so much ? What is it ? I believed you fled... You're pushing it! It's 4 floors down... Don't cry ! Pretend I'm traveling. OK? That I'm off to work in Milan. - And when I'm back... - When will you be back ? At the next amnesty, you prepare dinner for two. No, have no tears ! Tell me goodbye like you do each days. Yes, crooks too have a heart. Be strong, Annalisa ! Your wife moved me. I was about to give up and leave you home. But you've been brave ! I even believed you were really arresting me ! Go ahead, Chinotto, to the station ! New program, for one month. Life is beautiful. A stop in Florence, A visit in Bologna. We get together a little money, then to Milan... in flight to a great adventure ! We'll make Europe cry !
