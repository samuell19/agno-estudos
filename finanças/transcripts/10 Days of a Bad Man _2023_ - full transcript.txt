[wind howling] [exhales] [truck approaching] [vehicle door opening] [door closes] [loud rumbling] [spaghetti Western-style music playing] 10 DAYS OF A BAD MAN [soft clicking] [music continues] [man] Dude, you should take this more seriously. Because if anything happens to this guy, Sir will have our asses. [man moans] - He's alive. - [man 2] Cool. Why is Sir looking out for this guy? - No clue. What did he tell you? - "Go to Tomba, bring him back here." You know, this guy might not make it alive to Izmit, let alone Istanbul. It's Tosya, it's Tosya. - Where are we? - Karaağaç or something. [man 3] I gotta piss! - Ah! - [brakes squeal] - Huh? - [music stops] Hüso, what the hell you doing? You're banging up the half-dead guy! Dude, he scared me! I thought he resurrected when he yelled out like that! How could he resurrect if he's alive? You fucking meathead. [engine stops] - Zombie man, you okay? - [grunts] - [groaning] - [man 1] Hey. Come on, get up. Come on. Out. Come on. Shut it. Stand up. - [groans] - [grunts] - What's the matter with this guy? - [liquid dripping] Ah... - Sweet. - What? [urinating] Oh, son of a bitch! Didn't I tell you drinking all that water was gonna make you piss? Hüso, go get those sweatpants of yours. And some clean underwear too. - We'll just have to change him. - Hold on. Why's he getting mine then? Give him yours! - Just quit your whining and do it. - Fucking pain in the ass. - [Hüso] So, uh... - Yeah? - What about these? - Just toss 'em. Meds! [man 1] Check the pockets, he must have his meds in there. [Hüso] Christ... Yeah. - [bottle rattling] - Here. Here, we got your meds for you. All right? Hamlet. - What the hell? - He must mean his book. - [sighs] - It's in the car. O, that this too too solid flesh would melt, and... resolve itself... into a dew. DAY 1 [blues-rock music playing] [sniffs, huffs] Well, well. Nice of you to honor us with your presence, Master Sadık. [blows] By the way, I changed my name. It's Adil now. [Sir sniffs] That's a stupid name. [music continues] Whatever. Two weeks ago, I got a call from Tosya saying that one of my cars was in a wreck. And that Sadık Demir was the driver. What were you doing in Tosya? We thought you were in Eskisehir. Well, I had to take someone there. [sniffs] You can sit. Uh, no I can't sit down. I hurt my tailbone in the wreck. Painful. We settled our score with you nearly two full years ago. But now we have to unsettle it. First, the car you wrecked. Second, all of your hospital bills. The damages paid to her father and brother-in-law, unpaid debts, and a television to the police. [sighs] So, as you see, you've been quite costly for us, Sadık-Adil. Did I get it all, Hayati? Mostly. If that's what you say. But I have an idea how you can pay off these debts. You get to work. In your area of expertise, of course. Which is what? [groans] You're gonna find a playboy roaming around the rich crowd. Just like you found Tevfik. His name is Ferhat Gönen. Don't look at them! They've been making asses of themselves trying to blend into those circles. Hayati has the file on Ferhat. You have a phone? Of course you don't. The black one is for business calls. Same code for each. "Istanbul conquest." That should help you remember. My number, Hayati, Zeynel, and Hüso's are all saved. Personal? White one. I get it, I get it. Black for life, white for death. Black's for you, white's for me. Zeynel. Get him some money and cards from Hayati, and some decent clothes. - Sure, yeah, no problem. - And your chick. Chi... You mean my girlfriend? - Yeah, what's her name? - Ah. Maria. Maria! Have her pick the clothes. She's a whore, but a whore with taste. - [case clicks] - [loud whoosh] Take it. Go on. It won't bite. For this job you're gonna need it. Get a grip on it. [grunting softly] - [groans] - Okay, never mind. You'll have it when you're healed. As for now, just find Ferhat, that shit. And report back. On one condition. Are you insane? I'm hurting everywhere. My head, my arm, my ass... They all hurt. I need something really strong for all of it. Not the over-the-counter. Oh, you're a pill-popper? Hmm? How many do you take? He's only taken one today, Sir. The rest are in his pocket. One in the morning and one in the evening. - Mm. - And no more. Mm-mm. Two won't do. Tough shit! Two is all you get until you find that bastard Ferhat. And you keep a close eye on him. You'll report back to Hayati every night. Where can we stash him? At the flat. [tense music playing] [Sir sniffs] Take good care of it, we just had the place cleaned. Sadık, Adil, or whoever the fuck you are, find this bastard. Find him and let me know. Hm? [tense music continues] You got that file? How'd your accident happen? The road was clear, no weather or anything. You fall asleep? A tire blew, I guess. [Adil sighs deeply] I saw the car and I don't know how you didn't get killed. You must still have some unfinished business in life. Hey, man, let me ask you. My girl, Maria, I told her I was back and we could get together later tonight. Can she come here? You know, since we're going shopping tomorrow and everything Sure, sure. But maybe in return... one more painkiller? No. Hey, you told Sir I've had one today. So what difference does it make if the second one is tonight or now? - Come on, he'll kill me. - It's just a precaution. You don't want me barging into your room while you're in bed with Maria, screaming bloody murder and begging for pills, now do ya? Go on, get the pill. [Zeynel] You're gonna wanna plug your ears tonight too. It's going to be non-stop hot action all night. [Adil] I don't mind. I've got a guest coming too. A ghost. - Here. - Thank you. Tell me, Hayati, what's his story? He came to Sir six months ago, right away his right-hand man. Outta the blue. Hüso said that he used to be with the police force. Intelligence. He claims he's a man of faith, But I have a bad feeling about him. - I don't like him. - Hmm. Thanks. [mysterious music playing] [dog barking in distance] - [woman gasp] - [both scream] - [Zeynel] What the hell? - [gun cocks] Maria, right? I'm Adil. Just getting a drink. Go. Well, have a good evening. You do the same. - [playful music playing] - [door closes] - [Maria giggles] - [pill bottle rattles] [seagulls calling faintly] [sighs, grunts in pain] [exhales, groans] [ship horn blows] [groans] - Ah... - [seagulls calling] [sighs] [tranquil string music playing] [Adil] My ghost. [wind whistling] [Adil] Come back. [wind whistling] [classical music continues] And tell me what to do now. [classical music rises with anticipatory strings] [Adil] Tell me and let me be done with all of this waiting, and all of this meaninglessness. Come alive, my imagination. Come alive dreams that show me places I've never been. Bring the ghost with you. And settle upon my eyes. [steady deep breathing] [music fades] DAY 2 [woman] Oh, the good guy is back! And obviously you still have my number. [kisses] - So how was Eskişehir? - It was all right. [woman] Hmm. What happened to your arm? You get run over by a bus? I had an accident. Aren't you dressed cool. Smart-casual sure looks good on you. And you're still skipping school. School is out. [exhales] Fine! But it's good I skipped or I wouldn't have got your message. - When are you graduating? - Eight weeks. I'll be a graduate, and I'll have my money. [chuckles] Only after you turn 18. Actually, I turned 18 last year! Yeter messed up filing my birth certificate. And now I have 300,000 lira rotting in the bank, depreciating with each passing day, and all I can do is drool over it every time I walk by. You're a real big jerk. You know that, Sadık? Adil. It's Adil. I mean, for the time being. How is your mom? She quit waiting for Tevfik and moved back to her home village. She finally accepted that he had skipped town. I live with my aunt. You convinced her to leave you here by yourself? I told her I'd kill myself if she took me there, and she'd lose me just like she lost Tevfik. [chortles] Latte. And a variety of whatever you've got that's chocolatey. Well? Tell me what you've been doing for the last two years, Pops. Some tourist business. I have a little hotel I'm involved with now. Wow, you own a hotel? Great! So, Good Guy Sadık... Pardon, I mean Adil. So, Good Guy Adil is now in the tourism business. - What else? - [chuckling] You should cover those legs of yours. [laughs] Let the sucker think he can get it. Come to think of it, you're the only guy who's never given me a hot glance. But that's because you're a good guy, isn't that right? I'm not so sure about that. Maybe I should get a taste of being bad. Wow, so you're finally making a play for me, eh? It's probably too late for you with me though, 'cause there's this super young handsome guy I'm interested in. We're starting a business together, if I ever get my money, that is. Be careful. Don't talk about that money with people you barely know. Oof. Do you have to be such a bore? - [server] Here you go, miss. - Thanks. - [Adil chuckling] - All right, let's hear it. What did you want to meet me for? Well, the thing is, I'm... I'm hoping you can help me find someone, like you did two years ago. Who would hire you thinking you could actually find someone? You're hopeless at this. All those clues I gave you and you couldn't find Tevfik! Perhaps we'll be luckier this time. So what am I supposed to do that would help you? The guy supposedly hangs around places like this, fancy places. Trendy nightclubs, hip restaurants. Any idea where to look? Gimme your phone. Whoa! Look at you walking around with two phones! - What's the passcode? - 29-14-53 - Hey, Pops, you have like no apps. - Hmm? Never mind, I'm downloading some. Sorry we're late. Ah. My niece Pınar. this is my partner, Zeynel. [Zeynel] I know you don't have any cash, so here, take this. [Adil] Thanks. That is one very generous partner. All right, I've set you up. You have a profile, your name's CoolDaddy, also your passcode. And you and I are friends now. Say cheese! - [camera clicks] - Okay, that'll be your profile photo. I'm the only friend you've got, so I'm the only one who's seen it. Yup, and I "liked" it. Now tell me the first and last name of the guy you are looking for. Um, his name's Ferhat. Uh, damn - Don't remember his last name. - What are we supposed to do? There must be a million Ferhats on social media. [action music playing] [gasps, laughs] [ship horn blowing in distance] I guess the tourism Industry's not bad! [grunts] [Pınar] Wow, Good Guy, this is crazy. Is this really your place? Everything about Ferhat is in there. I'm taking a shower. [knocking] What? Do you have to wear that thing on your head at home? Look. What the hell? I had an accident! Find anything? Ferhat's in the wind. But I think I know how you can find him. So, it looks like Ferhat's account is legit, although it's been inactive for a month. Like, the guy's just vanished. - Yeah, we already know this. - That's not all, Pops. I checked his past posts and I saw that he liked every single post of two people, Güneşkurt and Bahar95. So I decided to go after the girl. Ferhat's liked every single photo of Bahar95 and also made tons of comments. Basically, he was hitting on her. But then, all of a sudden, everything stopped. And roughly around the same time, someone named SerhatF1 comes into the picture. He starts to send likes to Bahar95, and Bahar liked him back. So, F1Ferhat and SerhatF1 are the same person. Here's the interesting part, Serhat's face isn't visible in any pictures, you can only see his car, so finding him is going to be impossible. In order to find him you'll have to find Bahar95 first. I bet these two are seeing each other. Here's what I learned, she lives near here, loves Pilates, and goes for a run in the park every morning. Check out Pilates studios around here, I bet you'll run into her. How about you could check them out. You'll be compensated, of course. A thousand a day. And that's final, Pops. [chuckles] I'll make menemen for dinner if we're staying in tonight. Oh, menemen is awesome! But no onions, please, and use a lot of eggs. Cover your legs. [exhales] [cellphone ringing] [Pınar] Hello? Yes, ma'am. Okay. Maide. She wants to talk to you. Maide? [Maide] Hello, Sadık? If it's not Maide! I can hardly believe my eyes! You're on Instagram now, huh? I'm just as surprised as you are. This is a ' "speak of the devil" kinda thing. Guess who I'm with. It's not Rezzan, is it? No! Of course not. Doctor Buket Köseoğlu. She's a board member of KS Health Group, and she, uh, needs some help. I'm listening. When she explained her situation, I immediately knew this was a job for Sadık, and then Şule said you were in Istanbul. She saw you with Pınar on Instagram. Maide, sorry but... First off, I changed my name to Adil. Second, I'm already busy on another job. Come on, Sadık. Adil. Buket is my friend, and my psychiatrist. Hmm. Psychiatrist. Maide, you know I was in an accident? A doctor might be good for me to talk to. You see? That's great. How about tomorrow? Tomorrow morning's good. Great! Şule will let you know where you guys can meet tomorrow. Here. And tomorrow's cash too? No, no advances. That's just your cab fare. I'll call you tomorrow after school, so be ready. Hmm? First, check out all those gyms. You can tell 'em you're Bahar's friend and there on her recommendation. See if anybody knows her. Oh, and also, tomorrow night we'll go to Kuruçeşme, to a bar, or club, you know? - So clear your schedule. - Whatever you say Pops. [kisses] [cell phone ringing] - [Sir] Sadık Adil. - Hello. - What the hell are you guys doing? - We're fine. You fucking idiot! I don't care how you are. I said what are you doing? Ah. Well, we found a girl on social media who led us to Ferhat, she's one of those gym types. Uh, and I hired another girl who can get into those kinds of places, and knows her way around them, you know? Because I really don't know anything about Pilates. Uh, I'm gonna need a little backup. Like... Like someone with a car. 'Cause we have to stake out two spots tomorrow. And I'll need some more money too. For some gym memberships and for getting into those clubs. Hm? All right, I'll tell Hüso to drop by tomorrow. But remember, your debt is huge, and your time is short. I'm on it, boss. [Zeynel] We were both working on a contract job and became good buddies. But a few years ago we got discharged because of this idiot here. Insubordination. Here, Zeynel, put some on this side too. Hüso, shut the hell up, huh? Get that money Hüso brought over. Leave half of it here and we'll take the rest. Hüso, stay here and wait for my call. You'll have to take Pınar a few places. We'll meet up later tonight. [Hüso clears throat] Pınar is on the crew. She's Sadık's niece. Ah. - You done? - Almost. Ooh, watch out. Don't put too much pressure on it. - Easy does it. - [sighs] Ninety minutes tops. You'll have to move the meeting up. That works for me. DAY 3 [Buket] My uncle was Haşmet Köseoğlu. He was attacked and killed at his home a month ago. My Aunt Jale, was badly injured. My aunt identified the attackers, but they were never caught. Uncle was not just the manager, he was the owner of the company. [sniffles] So... it was a double loss because he was both breadwinner and part of the family. Uh... I hope you're not planning on asking me to go after your uncle's killers now. [chuckles] My mother's a sucker for crime shows and all the old detective stories. She doesn't think the case is solved. In essence, well... all we need from you here is that you verify the findings of the police department, to give my mother some peace of mind. How about if you, uh, tell me what you know. What happened that night? Didn't you read about it in the paper? It was all quite a sensation. Nah. No. All I've read for a month is Hamlet. Hamlet, huh? - Mm-hmm. - [inhales] Okay... There was a Moldovian couple working at the mansion, İanna and Ranat. They had been stealing from the family the whole time. Silverware, jewelry, money. Eventually, they were caught and immediately fired. Only, before going back to Moldovia, they decided to rob the mansion one more time. That night, the woman kept watch outside while her husband snuck into the house. - Unfortunately for everyone... - [dogs barking] ...my aunt and uncle had decided not to go into town for the weekend. Ranat killed my uncle. After forcing my Aunt Jale to open the safe he hit her over the head with the same bat. And they just walked away. So what do you think? Are you willing to help me out with this? I am. But first I need you to help me with something. Help how? I'm in a lot of pain. And I need a prescription. A real one. I see, a Level 2. If you can win over my mother then... then we can make an appointment. Just one session. I don't have much time. I don't either. [suspenseful music playing] Hey, Şule, this is Sadık. You've heard of KS Incorporated, right? Yeah. Can you do some research on them? Send me anything you can find on this Haşmet Köseoğlu, Buket Köseoğlu, and the wife and kids too. Okay? All right. Thanks. [dogs barking, whining] Why are you so restless today sweet girl? - Why? - [dog barks] Your coffee, ma'am. Momma? This is Adil. Hello, it's nice to meet you. - Some tea or something? - No, thank you. Come inside with me. Please, have a seat. Um, I'll stand, if you'll excuse me. I've been sitting all day. Very well. Oh, and I have to say, I love your name. [chuckles] Do you like crime novels? Sherlock Holmes, Agatha Christie? Well, Hammett's my favorite. I often find that authors like Christie, and Doyle who wrote the Holmes stories, wrote about cases that we almost never see in real life. Uh, so, for me, they don't feel realistic. For instance, the killers in real life are usually close to the victims. But in those stories, the killer is someone you'd never have thought of. Those cases can only be cracked by their authors. Let's say you have a case which is solved in the most logical way possible. That is, it seems like the case is closed. And yet your gut feeling is still saying, "No, this doesn't make sense." So the real suspects are still out there. What would you do? What I would do? Focus on proving that my suspects are the killers. Well? Exactly what Columbo would do! Adil, you're the man I've been looking for. I knew as soon as I saw you dressed like this. [dog barking] Buket, go play with Ates, would you? She's so restless today. All right then. I know who did it, Columbo. The one who killed my brother. I don't understand why no one believes me. What's going on? What's going on, huh? Come here, come here! If I hadn't threatened to take this to the papers, they would've never let me hire you. [dog barking playfully] This is İanna and Ranat. Jale convinced everyone that they did it so no one will look into this further. But the real killer is Jale. But she's your sister-in-law. As you said when you came in, the killer's always someone close. But the way I heard it she was also hurt badly. Then she injured herself? She must have an accomplice. - You need to find them too. - [Adil] Hmm. She has always been a wolf in sheep's clothing. [dog barking] Originally, things seemed to be all right. But she turned out to be so manipulative that only four months later she had gotten Haşmet to marry her. [thunder rumbling] Magnificent, no? My daughter's amazing, both determined and intelligent. - And also... - Gorgeous, right? But I can't take credit for that. She was two days old when Haşmet brought her to me. Her mother died in childbirth. We never kept Buket's history a secret. Jale had given birth as well. Haşmet was worried that I would be jealous. So this murder was a domestic affair. Uh... about Jale's child? - Or maybe children? - Two, actually. Gülhan, the apple of her father's eye. A doctor, as well. Vice-president of their company. Canberk, mmm, a handful of a kid. Haşmet had to buy his high school so he could graduate. [sighs] I guess this is where you live for now? - Ever since that night, it's true. - Hmm. Upstairs is Buket's room. The night he was murdered, I was asleep over there. In my dream, Haşmet was being strangled. I woke up with a scream. Şaziye came running from downstairs. [Adil] Um, can I keep those? Of course. And also, it'd be helpful if I could interview anyone who knows this couple well. Kenan. He was our head butler for 30 years. He doesn't believe Ianna and Ranat are capable of murder either. Jale fired him as soon as she got released from the hospital. Maybe if we find Ianna and Ranat, we could get answers for all this. Where do you think they are right now? In the wind. They lost them. In the wind? Who's "they"? Jale and her accomplice. [mysterious Western-style music playing] Aren't you gonna give me your number, Columbo? Ah, yes, of course. [Buket] That was impressive. 'Cause, damn, I didn't think you could win over my mother that easily, you know? I guess you probably know, your mother thinks your aunt is responsible for her brother's death. Although she, um, couldn't give me any motive other than robbery. [Buket] Mmm. But she, uh, gave a name. Kenan. Uh, you think he might know something? Kenan was let go because they found out that he was having an affair with İanna. When the cops searched through her room, they found all kinds of dirty pictures of them together. My mother was able to control the mansion for years through Kenan. In return, she was paying him a lot in extra salary. We're here. [Buket] Let's start with why you're here, Adil. [gentle music playing] [Adil] Two years ago, we moved to Eskisehir. Uh, me, Fatoş, my fiancée who was 20 years younger than me, and my old friend Meral, who jokingly adopted me as her son. Fatoş had recently retired from prostitution. She didn't want to live together unless we were married. She was traditional. So we got married. My new mother had a house in Eskişehir which was left to her by an ex-lover. And we had a good sum of money with us. We decided to turn that house into a hotel. Fatoş wanted to be in some kind of managing position once we got the hotel running. So she decided to take her high school exams. And to support her in this, I enrolled in an open undergraduate program. Philosophy, to be exact. I made some promises to Fatoş, I quit a lot of things. I quit being cold. I was always trying to guess the time without looking at my watch. I quit that, too. I quit drinking, I quit smoking. I had new habits. I was reading literature and philosophy like a madman. And we were happy, we really were. Then, the thing that every happy couple should experience happened, Fatoş got pregnant. They said it would be a girl. [chuckles softly] I've always known that happiness wasn't for me. Something always goes wrong. It always does. And it did. [music continues] DONATED BY HAJI YUSUF EROL We're close now We'll be there soon. [Adil] During childbirth, something went wrong inside. I don't know, maybe it was God's intervention. We were going to name our daughter Yağmur. It means ' "rain". Fatoş used to talk a lot about her mother, she was very fond of her, she missed her very much. They had stopped talking because of Fatoş' job, And then she suddenly passed away. She was buried in a village in Tosya, and it was my spur-of-the-moment decision to bury them there next to her mother. [music ends] [panting] But then, out of the blue, Fatoş' father shows up. She hadn't talked to him in years, and this is my first time meeting my father-in-law. He runs up with some other guy, and he's yelling about, "Don't you bury that whore next to my wife!" I tried to talk some sense to him, said It was his daughter and he should respect her wishes. The guy wouldn't listen, just kept yelling. At some point, I got really pissed at him. I finally just lost it. Damn you! First I broke one of his legs, then I broke the other. I was gonna rip out his tongue for calling my wife a whore, But then someone hit me from behind. Her brother-in-law, Fatoş's. [exhales sharply] The one who raped her when she was 16. The guy who gave her pimp of a father, whose legs I'd broken, two lots of land to cover it all up in exchange. Bastard. [father groaning in pain] - [man moans] - Crushed his nuts. - I burst them. - [imam] Stop! Stop! [Adil] I was gonna kill him, but the Imam stopped me. Afterward, I buried Fatoş and our daughter, hugging each other, next to Fatoş' mother. I got back in the car and hit the road. At some point, a tire blew and the car flipped. And what you see is what I've become. And so? Have I earned a prescription? [sighs deeply] [clears throat] [chuckles] [Buket] Adil... No, actually it's Sadık Demir. Sadık Demir. I have to tell you in advance that these drugs are addictive and should never be taken with alcohol. My assistant will give you half of them now and the rest I can give to you personally. Shall we say next Sunday sometime? And then you can give me any updates. - What do you say? - Okay. Okay. Is that it? One last thing. It's... it's just routine. Where were you that night? I was home. Gülhan and I were. And Canberk was in Antalya. [mysterious music playing] For you. The first half of what we owe you. [woman] Here you go. Ah. Thanks so much. Yes, hello, is this Mister Adil? How are you? This is Kenan, former head butler at the Köseoğlu mansion. - Lady İsmet uh, gave me your phone number. - I see. She said you're looking for İanna and her husband. I want you to know they're not thieves. They were set up to take the fall by Jale. Set up how? Jale planted the jewelry in İanna's room. And Jale herself is the killer. Did you tell that to the police? No, I never did. Because Jale threatened me and then fired me. So you weren't let go because you were having an affair with İanna? [horse neighing] Uh... Now, Adil, wait. Listen. Um... İanna and her husband weren't fired. They found a job with much higher pay and they left to go take it. Uh, Timurlenk arranged it. He's the only one who knows where they are. Who's Timurlenk? Timur's the guy who takes care of the dogs at the mansion. I have no idea if he's still there or not, but I have an old address for him. I can at least give you that. - It's a dog farm in Gebze. - Okay, text it to me. [upbeat funky music playing] - Hello, big daddy! - [Adil] Hello. Your Hüso is a good guy, but he's cheap. I'll show you how you can look rich on only 3,000 lira. What did you find out? The good news is that I found Bahar95. In fact, I even had a session with her PT, her personal trainer. The bad news is no one has seen this girl for about ten days, and when I asked for her phone number, the PT got suspicious. He said, "I thought you were her friend." That's it for now, I gotta go and unpack. - Bye! - Bye. [music continues] Tomorrow I need you to go to this address. There's a guy named Timur there. I want you to check him out. See what his deal is. This is for the other job. I'll tell you about it later. Se? It's good. [Pınar] I just sent a picture of myself to Ferhat. Now he'll have to decide, Bahar95 or Pınar2001. And I'll stay here tonight. It'll be too late to go all the way home. Got it. [engine revs] [camera shutter clicking] Hüso and I are gonna hang back. We haven't had luck blending in here. Oh, really? Fine. Sir, sir! Would you like to buy some roses for the pretty ladies? Yeah, sure, give me one. [cameras continuing clicking] [shutter click echos] - [upbeat rock music playing] - [indistinct chatter] We're gonna dance. [music continues] - Do you know this guy? - [man] Nope, sorry. - A glass of milk, please. - Yes sir. Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa! CoolDaddy, this is so much fun, we're really great for each other! Why are you being such a downer? There are at least ten guys here who'd give their right arm to trade places with you. And I deserve a bonus too, 'cause SerhatF1 has just started hitting on me. The likes are pouring in, and I asked if that car was his. Let's see what he says! [music continues] Sorry to disturb you, but I have news. I thought it would help to show the picture of Ferhat to the guys at the door. And bingo. Turns out four days ago, management here handed them the exact same picture. And they told them to call a certain phone number if they see the guy. So someone else is looking for him too. No. I checked the phone number and it's yours. What do you mean? Just what I said. They told them to call Sadık Demir if they see him. Isn't that you? Hayati needs to know about this right now. No, no, don't call him. Uh... Let's only tell Hayati about the Pilates. Not a word about this place. What're you playing at, Sir? What are you really after? Hayati, jeez! [suspenseful music playing] - Thank you. - Sure yeah. [car door closes] - He's not coming in? - Oh, he never does. Five years ago, we were raided up in the mountains. Since then he won't sleep in any of the houses. - [peaceful classical music playing] - [grunts softly] Come back. And tell me what I should do. [Adil] Tell me, and let me be done with this waiting And all the meaninglessness. Come alive, my imagination. Come alive, dreams that show me places I've never been. Bring the ghost with you and settle upon my eyes. [Pınar] It's me. - [gasps] - [music ends] [seagulls calling loudly] Do you hear that outside? It's a flock of seagulls. They're freaking me out. So, can I sleep in here with you? [seagulls continue noisily] All right [Adil groans in pain] You called me Fatoş just now. That's your wife's name, right? Is she young? Or... older than you? [seagulls continue] She was 24. You got a divorce? What happened? [exhales] You lied then. I thought you said you took her to her mother. That's the truth. I buried her next to her mother. [emotional music playing] DAY 4 [Adil] How're you doing, Şule? [Şule] Hello, Sadık. I'm fine, thanks. Has Hüseyin delivered the package to you? [Adil] Yes, he has. I'm checking it out as we speak. Do you have anything more to add? Some, yes. Here's what I know. Haşmet Köseoğlu was a very ambitious physician. He came from humble beginnings and then became a health tycoon. Married twice. Rumor has it he divorced his first wife because she was unable to conceive, and met his second wife, Jale, while she was working at his hospital. His son, Canberk, is apparently a terrible person. [laughs] He couldn't get a job as a shoeshiner if it wasn't for his family name. But his daughter Gül and niece Buket are extraordinary women. Some call them the Scarlet Twins. They grew up together, went to the same schools. Both are also pioneers in social projects. Buket is notorious for her controversial ideas in the health industry. The interesting part is they're always together. I couldn't find any pictures where they're alone. And there also never seem to be any men around them. I emailed you a few links. Şule, you're the best. Thank you. [ship horn blowing] [Western-style music playing] [Adil] Hey Zeynel, are you in Gebze? Yeah, I'm just leaving the dog farm. I threw the guy who runs the place 500 lira and he talked a bunch. He says your guy Timur is a sleazy scumbag. He had a wife, but she died ten or 15 years ago. [dogs barking on phone] She was a caretaker for people in the neighborhood. When she died, her daughter fell on hard times. Her name is Filiz. She cut all ties with Timur, said he was a lunatic. I told the dog guy this was a legal matter concerning a will, gave him cash, your number, and told him to call you. I think he'll probably call. I showed him a photo of İanna and Ranat, but he's never seen them. Okay. All right, I'll text you a location. Bye. So now what am I gonna do? Timur's in the wind since the murder. And what've we got? His daughter, Filiz. [cell phone ringing] Yes, Pınar? Pops, guess what? ThatSerhatF1 has just sent me a photo of the car's registration! [laughing] And the name on the registration is Ferhat! He says he wants to meet up once he's done with a few things. I told him I'd think about it while I'm down on my knees. - [laughs] - We got the sucker! Awesome, kid. But wait, how come you're not in school? We're on break. You just worry about me getting that bonus. All right, all right, bye. Finally, you honor us. What's that? You're walking around with a toilet seat, huh? - Where's Hüso at? - Looking for Ferhat at the Pilates club. [Sir yelling] And you? Slacking off during the day and then at night... fucking whores? Hm? I guess so. And in the meantime, feeding me lies. [tense music playing] Why didn't you include in your report to Hayati that you were at a bar in Kuruçeşme last night? [Zeynel groans] - [Zeynel] Oh! - [yelps] What're you up to? Huh? - [grunts] - [Maria gasps] No! And what the hell were you doing this morning? Why were you in Gebze? Ow! I asked him to go there! I did! - I asked him! - Why? [Maria sobs] [Zeynel wheezing] I sent him. And I told him not to tell you about the bar. Because I don't trust him! He's up to something. [tense music continues] - Get the hell up! - [Zeynel groans] [grunting] You're off this job. You're useless. Haluk will replace you. Zeynel goes, I go. Listen... if there's a brain inside that skull of yours, you'll shit bricks when you see me. I could kill you with a touch. I already died. In Tosya. I'm in purgatory just waiting for my time. I have no more regard for my life than I have for a needle. What? Are you high on those painkillers? What are you saying? Huh? Zeynel is nothing. What the hell is he to you? He's my friend! My friend. I knew his father. Back in the day. He used to give us kids free candy at the holidays. Zeynel's my friend. Hayati. Give him two hundred dollars. Haluk and Recep, you go fuck this whore. Make sure Zeynel sees you, too. [Maria whimpering] - [Sir] Shut up! - No, wait, please! - Shut up. Now you listen. - [Zeynel groans] You find that fucking kid by Tuesday and call me and say, "I found him, boss." Or we'll come back and fuck everyone. [Maria] Stop it! Hüso, as well as that whore you hired. - [whimpering] - [Zeynel panting] Don't. [Maria] Somebody help me! Don't. [Maria pleading indistinctly] Get your hands off of me. Ah! [Maria screaming] - [music intensifies] - [Zeynel breathing shakily] [Maria screaming] - [water running] - [Zeynel breathing heavily] [Zeynel groans] My dad... was a shuttle driver. He never gave out candy. But he was a very good man. I'm gonna kill those two. Hayati goes too. Just the three of them? [suspenseful music playing] Are you serious? I'm in. From now on, I'll do whatever you say to. I swear. You stood up to those assholes. I'm grateful. All right But we need to be extremely careful. They know everything about us. I'll bet there are trackers in all the cars. The cellphones came from them too. Hayati is a sneaky little shit. I have to get Maria back home now. Go. [melancholy music playing] [door closes] Great news! No menemen tonight! Pizzas are on me. [sighing] Hüso strong-armed the PT and we got Bahar's address. But the broad's not home, the superintendent said she was on a trip. Tomorrow, Hüso and I are gonna stakeout her place. Hey. You know that 300,000 lira I've got? Could we withdraw it now instead of later? My boyfriend has this great business opportunity. And he wants to do it together. I like somebody for once and he likes me back, So come on, Pops, just this one time, don't say no! Does this boyfriend have a name? Mert. So call Mert and tell him your mother confiscated the money because you're too young. Tell him you get it in a year. And what would I do that for? You really want that money? You go ahead and call him, then. [sighs] [exhales tersely] This is more than we can put up with. [Adil] We won't put up with it, We'll make them pay, but in due time. For right now we're going to have to wait. Yeah, all right. From now on, we answer to you. We report to you and no one else, chief. So it seems. Zeynel's started to call me "boss." And you just said "chief". [chuckles] Hmm. I'll, uh, get this place cleaned up and wait for Zeynel downstairs in the car. [Pınar] What do you mean you can't wait a year? [Pınar] What do you mean you can't wait a year? - Screw you! - [glass shatters] - [door opens] - [footsteps approaching] - [bed creaks] - [Adil groans] [Adil sighs deeply] Don't beat yourself up. It happens. Youth is a time of disappointments. Is that supposed to help me? [seagulls calling] No one's ever loved me. It's my fate. Can you do something for me, Pops? Would you just hold me? Yeah. - I'll tell you what. - Hm? Say you love me and I'll love you just the same. Think that's how it works? Hmm? Love's not a transaction kid. When you love, you don't expect anything in return. Well, I'm Gen Z, Pops. For us everything is a deal. Mmm. That so? Well, then I'll ask a favor of you too. What? Make love with me? Huh? Yeah... You have to find this Ferhat soon. Like, tomorrow soon. [swinging music playing] [Pınar] Then we're going to have to take a shortcut to lure him in. Let's see how good you are at photography. [camera clicking] [clicking continues] [clicking continues] Good news. Your Ferhat replied to the pics immediately. He's got a guest but they're leaving soon. [chuckling] Look! The moron even texted his address. Good for you. Well done. [Adil grunts in pain] [seagulls calling] You need tender hands, someone to look after you. Have you been smoking? Do you hear the seagulls? They're back again! Forget about them. Fine, you can sleep here. Keep your arms and legs to yourself. But you do kinda like me, don't you? And before long it'll turn to love. [sensual music playing] [Adil sniffing deeply] I sure do miss smoking. Why don't you go and have a cigarette then? 'Cause I promised someone. - [Adil groans] - [music fades] We need a clean car, so check it carefully. We'll take Pınar's phone and forward all of our numbers to it. And take any calls on that. Uh, we'll all leave our phones here. Who do you think you are? Super spies? There's no way in hell I'm giving you my phone. [exhales] Okay, but only if I get to come with you. [cell phone chimes] Bingo! Ferhat wants to meet up tonight. [laughs] Now he's scared that I'll get away from him, the stupid idiot. Didn't I tell you, Daddy? I'll have him on his knees tonight. You'll see. DAY 5 [action music playing] [Adil] Which floor is it? If something goes wrong inside, you get behind me, okay? [giggles] Sadık's in love with Pınar! Stop that. This is serious. [clatters] [intercom beeps] - [Ferhat] Hello there! - Are you ready, Ferrari? [door buzzes, unlocks] [elevator dings] Whoa, what the hell? What the hell is this? Stay down! - I haven't done anything. What is this? - [laughing] Heads up. I told you I'd have him on his knees, didn't I? - [continues laughing] - [Adil] Shh. Inside. Get inside. - [Ferhat] Take it easy. Don't hurt me. - [Adil] Move. Shut the door. [music continues] [flaps lips] Come on man. [music fades] [Adil] All right, Ferhat. We're gonna take that thing off you. Do not scream. Or my friend here will shoot you right where you sit. Got it? Oh man! - Mister, look, it's not my fault. - Shh. [sobbing] I swear! Mister Sadık, that woman was mad, I'm telling you, she was a crazy woman! How do you know my name? You know who I am? - Tell me how you know! - [Zeynel] Spill it! Uh... from all those texts you sent! Check it out, they're all in my messages! You texted me a lot, mister! [Ferhat sobs] "You killed my Yasemin and I'm gonna kill you." Who's Yasemin? Ah! Yasemin was Sir's niece. A few months ago he said she died in an accident. Turns out she had a boyfriend though, and she actually killed herself because of him. It happened in one of Sir's clubs. [sniffling] [Adil] Did this girl kill herself because of you? - For this fuckin' loser? - What's it got to do with me? You said she was your ex-fiancée. And then you started texting me, you said "You killed Yasemin and now I'm gonna kill you", over and over again! [sobbing] I didn't do anything. - I swear I didn't, please believe me! - All right, all right, stop. What do you do? Yeah, I get it, you live off your dad. - So what does your dad do? - [Ferhat sobs] He's a congressman. And former law enforcement. Hell, boy, why didn't you tell him? Because this is the second time it's happened and he won't help me anymore. [sobs] [Adil] All right, all right. Take a picture of him like this here. Whose place is this? It's a rental. Still ten more days on the lease. Ferhat, I'm not the one who wants to kill you. It's Yasemin's uncle. We're not fans of him, either. So we're letting you off the hook here. You need to get out of town right now, disappear. Stop sharing anything online, okay? I'm gonna keep your phone, anyway. Get his passcode. Tell me this, Serhat-Ferhat. Is that Ferrari yours at least? - [Ferhat] Well... - [Pınar] Fucking liar. - [Hüso laughs] - [music continues] [Adil] Sir holds Ferhat responsible for his niece's suicide. So he decides to kill him. But there is one huge obstacle, the jackass' daddy is a congressman. So, it's too big a risk. Right around that time I get into that accident, leading the cops onto Sir because of his name on the registration. Sir can't have that. So he and Hayati come up with a solution. They start texting Ferhat like they're me, saying "I'll kill you, cut you into pieces", etcetera, etcetera. Giving him the false impression that I'm a jealous avenging fiancé. Then you guys come into play. You come to Tosya, pick me up from the hospital, and take me back to Sir. Sir gives me the phone he's been using to text Ferhat. Obviously, he's deleted the texts so that I don't see them. And then they hand me a gun and make sure it's got my fingerprints on it. What did Sir tell me that day? Just find him and report back. Why? Now you lost me. Because he doesn't want me to talk to Ferhat. 'Cause if I do, I'll figure everything out! Remember what happened the other night when we went to the club? They had already given my number to the guys there, in case they saw Ferhat. All the evidence is set. Let's say I found Ferhat and called Sir up. You know what would happen next? A bullet to Ferhat's head, sure as shit, from the gun with my fingerprints on it. Then another bullet to my head. The next day's headlines practically write themselves. "Jealous former lover shoots the guy responsible for his fiancée's suicide, and then kills himself using the same gun." Well done there, chief. Seriously. You figured out everything in nothing flat. It's a God-given gift! It won't be long though before they realize we know what they're doing. You're right. Yeah, that's true. But really... this is all my problem. You two really oughta wash your hands of the whole thing. Seriously? Boss, do you think we're the type of guys who'd let their chief down like that? Just tell us what the plan is and we'll do it. We take down Hayati and Sir. Well, he has eight guys. Not great odds. Yeah, I know it But I have an idea. - Amazing brain. - Genius. [sighs] Do you still have Tevfik's videos? What for? To try and save our asses. It sounds serious. On Monday you go back to school, okay? You should keep your distance from us. [sensual music playing] You're in love with me, you just don't know yet. And it's totally real. It'll happen. [chuckles] Maide, I need you to get me in the same room with the president of Kaan Incorporated. As soon as you can get it to happen. It's urgent. I have information about the killer of his twins. DAY 6 - Good morning. - Good morning, Adil. Right on time. It's exactly eleven o'clock. Your mom's not here? She stays up all night watching her TV shows. She's never up until noon. I get it. You mean you wanted to talk to me alone. - [chuckles] - All right then, I'll go first. Uh, all quiet on the murder front. So... I've earned my remaining meds, no? [laughs] I do want to ask you something. Have you ever wondered who your biological parents were, or, you know, have you looked for them? Why are you so curious about my history? It's very puzzling Adil. Family history is crucial in a murder case. [boat engine revving] Hoppa! Oh, and your, uh, "Scarlet Doctor" nickname, isn't it a bit contradictory to live like this when you're a leftist? Well, better to be left wing and not match your home than to be right wing. Well, I guess this "Once A Week" project was your idea. It's something Gül and I developed together. It's going really well. We're actually planning on making it twice a week. - Good morning. - Good morning. [kissing] What's up? My cousins, Gül and Can. This is Adil, he's an attorney. He's my consultant. A pleasure. We have an army of attorneys and you hire this guy. - Is he special? - [İsmet] Good morning, all. - Welcome, Adil. - Good morning. - Thank you. How are you? - Good, thanks. Please. [Can]The surgery was so easy! I lost 80 pounds. And they have this skin operation, takes another three! Hey, why not? [laughs] Your mom isn't coming? Uh, she's still not well. She's in pain. It must be depressing for her. This Bosporus air would've been good for her. Ah, don't worry Lady İsmet, I'll bring her next time. But first you have to convince Thelma and Louise here to help me out! [laughs] Hey, don't give me that dirty look! I didn't give you that name, you know. It was in your yearbook. Oh, also, I just hired the perfect company to promote our new center, the Cevizli Agency. [İsmet] What? - You tell that woman she's fired today. - But I... Don't you remember how she tortured these girls? She even tried to have them expelled! But, Auntie, the point is the woman knows what she's doing! She's good! It's why we chose her! Come on, I mean are you guys really still angry with Şükran? You fire that woman and that's final. [tense music playing] [İsmet] Gathering everyone here today was my idea but it didn't work. I wanted you to meet Jale, but... The witch read the wind and didn't show. What have you found? Nothing yet. But don't worry, I expect something soon. [İsmet] Hold on. Columbo, catch them soon. I'm counting on you. Please know I trust you. The remaining 2,500. I'm not done investigating. Need ten full days. So you're saying we'll see each other again. - Maybe. Hey, Can. - Yo! - You're going across? - Yeah, yeah. - May I join you? - Hop in, come on. Take care. [intriguing music playing] Drop by when we open the new center. Okay? [cell phone ringing] [Can] Hey, Miss Şükran! [laughing] Hello. You know, I was just about to call you. Well, I need to leave town for a few days to settle some other things. Yeah, we'll get the contract signed real soon, you know? Ah. [laughs] No, this has nothing to do with Thelma and Louise! Thank you. All right, thank you. See you, thanks. I have no idea who Şükran is, but just her name seemed to make your aunt furious. [Can] Don't get me started, it's all Buket and Gül's nonsense. When they were back in middle school, they got into some kind of an argument with her. - They've hated each other ever since then. - I see. Still? Oh yeah. Speed her up? Huh? - Ha-ha! - [engine accelerating] [Can] Awesome, huh? NATURAL HEALTH CENTER [Pınar] Hello! How are you? Same old same old. Not great. You should cheer up a little. This is our first date, so we should enjoy it. [lighter clicking] Hey. Talk to me. What kind of a person was your wife? I want to know. What things attracted you to her, why you fell in love with her, what things you liked best about her. Her eyebrows or her eyes? Her body? Whatever. We can talk about it over lunch. Should we go have lunch somewhere around here? We can talk, get to know each other. Share deep dark secrets, huh? Pınar. [emotional music playing] Tevfik is dead. You're kidding me. And I delivered him to his killer. I'm trying to make you fall in love with me, but you... [cell phone ringing] - [Maide] Sadık? - It's Adil. Damn it, Maide! The meeting's on. Kaan is expecting you at eight o'clock. But these are dangerous people, Sadık... Adil. You know they're mixed up with the Chechen mob, right? All right, I'll text you the address. He was a very bad person. Even worse than you, but still... I know. We need to do this another time. Someplace I have to be. [seagulls calling] So Ranat and İanna become friends with Timur, the guy who looks after the dogs there at the mansion. And the three of them decide to rob the place. So it was second degree murder. I don't think they knew the victim was going to be home. This is my second case. We have no secrets now. Understood. One more thing. Pınar's not my niece. I knew her brother. That's all I'll say about that. [melancholy music playing] KAAN HOLDING [car door closes] [music continues] Should I bring them up? They're clean. - Which one is Sadık? - Me. [music continues] Sadık Demir. Talk, I'm listening. Well, I'll need my phone again. What I'm about to show you is on it. [uneasy sounds echoing] [Adil] That's a ritual killing. The two in masks are your twins. Maybe you recognize the place? The location of the video is your mansion, the one that burned down. There's another video. Check that out, too. That young man that you see? Tevfik. He used to supply your twins with boys and girls to serve as their torture victims in these rituals. The other guy, a mobster, he goes by the name of Sir. He's the more jealous and troublesome of the two. He killed the twins, then Tevfik, and burned it all down. Why have you kept this all secret? Suddenly you felt the urge to talk? What do you want? Money? How much? The guy who murdered your twins is after me now. He wants me dead too. My men and I need to kill him before he kills us. But there's a problem. We're only three, and he has at least eight. And why do you think I'd be willing to assist you? [restless music playing] I met your twins at that house that they were living in. They were very keen on the act of the hunt itself. If that's an inherited trait, well, I bet you'd like an opportunity to take revenge. And these videos of yours? They'll be buried in silence. [tense music playing] Don't trust anyone who's not on your payroll. That has always been the motto I've lived by. And I don't trust people who try to own me. That is my own motto. We have a common goal. Take revenge. [suspenseful guitar chords playing] [Kaan] Order a team. Six men. With a private jet. You never saw me. We never had this conversation. The day after tomorrow, the men you need will show up. You can sort out the details with Selami. [funky Western-style music playing] [Buket] Adil, hello. I've just received a call from the police. They found İanna and Ranat's bodies on a mountain path in the Strandzhas. The cops think they were trying to cross into Bulgaria but got lost on the way and froze to death. They've ruled it an accident and closed the case. And so your case is closed too I think. We should meet up for a coffee and talk about the details. Yeah, we should. [dramatic music playing] DAY 7 [Buket] Here's what I thought we'd do. I'll Give you your 2,500 dollars now, And after we have coffee, we can go over to my mother's. You can break the news to her, tell her your investigation is finished. [Adil chuckles] - No good? - It isn't finished. I'm not done investigating. I'm going to see this thing through. Just like Columbo. Indulge me for two more days. Why Columbo? What does that mean? It just means I have to find a new suspect. We've been over this, I know Jale is not the one who killed my uncle, it's just impossible. Jale's not who I'm thinking. Who? It's you. [laughs] - Me? - Yeah, you. Because this wellbeing project which is so important to you was facing an obstacle in your uncle. A threat. And anytime he felt like it, he could've shut down the whole program. Am I right? You're forgetting that I told you I was with Gül at that time. Three people, including my mom, can vouch for that. Though I'd like to know... why you suspect me instead of Can or Gül or anybody else? Because it's gonna be more dramatic. You know I read Hamlet. Don't underestimate me. Besides, I made a promise to your mother, the Columbo thing. And you can be sure that, just as soon as we leave this place, I'll be coming for you. Hm! You are full of surprises. This is the rest of your fee. Our arrangement is over. And the meds? I don't prescribe meds without a session, you know that. - And this wasn't one? - I don't want to see you again. See that you stay away from me, and from my mother, Columbo. [Adil chuckles] Oh... So that accident that you had, it certainly wasn't because your tire blew. You knew what you were trying to do that day, don't you? I think you'll try it again. I'll see you soon, Miss Buket. Very soon now. [cellphone ringing] SELAMİ MOBILE [Selami] Your order is being prepared. The package will arrive in Istanbul at 7:00 p.m. tomorrow. We can start the job at nine o'clock. Wow. Just Imagine living here, yeah? [Adil] Hello. - Welcome. - Thank you. The dog's been tied to her kennel. Take a walk around the yard, kiddo. Columbo, I have a bad feeling about this Ranat story. Maybe I'm wrong and it wasn't Jale, but there's something wrong here. I still don't believe those two are the murderers. [birds chirping] - You know what we should do? - What's that? Find a new suspect. [footsteps approaching] You're home early. Why's that? - I'm having a migraine. So I came home. - [cell phone ringing] All right, go get some sleep. Hmm. Yes, your mother's right. - Migraines are a terrible affliction. - [ringing stops] Take a strong painkiller and get some rest. Leave this house, right now. Buket. no. I called him! This man who introduced himself to us as Adil is actually Sadık. He's using you to make me prescribe meds to him. Well, only the name part is true. Still, I'll go. Uh, just give me a couple of days. All right? - I'll have the real killer very soon now. - You're sure? - Are you serious? - I told you to go to your room. Mom, this man is just a con artist! You were disbarred as a lawyer, you served time in prison, and you're also a drug addict. Isn't all that true, Adil? Or should I say Sadık? It's all true. - I'll see you. - Not a chance. [Adil scoffs] Let's go. - How do you like my new perfume? - [sniffs] From the yard there was a staircase that led upstairs. Three rooms, all with great views. So nice! The perfume? I found it in the largest room. I think it's that angry girl's. Buket, was it? I could smell it when we were in the living room. What would you have done if she came upstairs? The acoustics in the staircase were perfect, I heard everything. Besides, I came back down as soon as the yelling stopped. - Wanna go shopping? - Can't. We have work to do. Hello, Canberk, I have a favor to ask of you. [intriguing music playing] - [Adil] Hello there. - [Şükran] Şükran Cevizli. - Adil. - My pleasure. Any friend of Canberk is a friend of mine. I hope we can be of help to you, Adil. So, you and Canberk go way back, I suppose? Unfortunately, my connection was to his sister. School days. [Adil] Hmm. Please. I'm back. You ghost me whenever I mention shopping. So what's the deal with this Şükran? I've just learned some amazing things, kiddo. Would you stop calling me "kiddo"! Let's hear it. This Şükran Cevizli, she was friends with Buket and Gülhan back in school. But one day, for some reason they got into a fight... And the next day someone pushed the girl down a staircase and left her crippled. Gülhan and Buket pushed her? Well, obviously that was never proven, but Şükran says she's sure it was them. Why would they do that? [Adil] Back when Buket and Gülhan were in school, there was a rumor floating around about them being lovers. They suspected that the rumor was spread by Şükran. And I wouldn't doubt that, because she does seem the type. Anyway, Şükran started running her mouth to Buket. calling her a "rich bitch" and stuff like that. Next night, down the staircase. [whooshing sound] [intense music playing] [Adil] She was left handicapped. So our sweet-smelling woman can be vengeful and dangerous when she's pissed off, huh? Well, actually, Şükran thinks Gülhan pushed her. [cell phone chimes] "Hello there, Mr. Zeynel." - Zeynel? What about him? - Just keep reading. "Hi, this is Filiz, Timurlenk's daughter." "You've been trying to call me about a will concerning my father." "I've called you twice. Please text me what this is about." - Who's this? - Someone we're looking for. Okay. Let's go. [creepy music playing] [music fades] Hey boss. Couldn't sleep? Why are you up? Something's bothering me, Zeynel. I just can't put my finger on it. It's like there's a string waiting to be pulled before it all unravels. You'll figure it out. I bet you've got the whole picture in your mind. Yeah, right. A picture. [chuckles] - Photograph. - Hmm? Photograph. [mysterious music playing] Uh... K&S HOSPITAL SHOCKING NEWS! VP BUKET KÖSEOĞLU RESIGNS - [Zeynel] You thought of something? - I've got you now. Good job, Zeynel! Now I'm gonna write a script for a murder. One half-truth, the other half made up. It's all coming together. Go inside, you're gonna freeze. It's gonna snow, go. Okay. Good luck. [music continues] NEWLY RECRUITED DOCTOR FROM THE U.S. FALLS VICTIM TO DRUNK DRIVING [cell phone ringing] - Miss Buket. - [Buket] Good morning, Mr. Adil. I think we need to talk. Oh dear. And not even 24 hours since you said you'd never speak to me again. It's that text you sent me late last night. What are you... I just don't want you to forget that I'm still Columbo here. [sighs] - Let's talk. - Gladly. Three o'clock. At the mansion. Where your uncle was killed. Bring Gülhan too. All right then. [intriguing music playing] [bird cawing] DAY 8 [Adil] Today, here at the scene of the crime, I'm going to put an end to your game. Besides a photograph, what evidence do you have? The story of two beautiful ladies. Why don't we start with Buket. Jale was pregnant with Gülhan. İsmet was furious when she learned this news. Now Jale would inherit everything. İsmet had no children of her own. That's where your uncle comes into the story. He buys you from a nurse who had just given birth to twins. Your no-good father was in prison. Your mother was desperate, she was all alone. So that day you were separated from your twin, but you found your lifelong partner. Gülhan. Years passed, everything was great. Until your real father, Timur, shows up out of nowhere. He shows up and starts blackmailing you and your dad. That's when you learned you had a twin. You looked for her and found her. Your mother was long dead. The poor girl was all alone. You took her in, you helped her out, you even helped your dad. Since these dogs in your yard came from his farm, you must still be in touch. Haşmet Köseoğlu turned making money into an art. He was opening new hospitals one right after the other. And his daughter was just like him. What his son lacked in intelligence, sophistication and good looks, she had in abundance. Soon the company would be hers. But then came Canberk's idea for a genetics' center, right? A center for genealogical testing. In fact, at the grand opening of the center you were the first ones to give blood samples. And according to the results, Gülhan was not Haşmet's daughter. To think the most important person in your life, who you'd been in love with since you were six, wouldn't share the wealth of the Köseoğlu's family was devastating. The charity projects you created would never come to life. It dawned on you Gülhan might even be kicked out of the mansion. All of this. And there you have your motive. So you figured a way out. Your dad, Timur, goes to İanna and Ranat with a job offer they can't refuse. And soon after, they leave the mansion. After their departure, you go into their room and plant the jewelry. Subsequently, they're charged with larceny and the plan is in motion. Even before the murder was committed, the killer was created. That night, İsmet, while asleep in her room, had a nightmare. She woke up screaming. Everyone at home came and gathered around her. But you two? You didn't come down at all. And don't tell me you didn't hear anything from your rooms. Because the other day when I was there, I had an associate with me, a young woman. While she was waiting for me to finish talking with you and İsmet, she walked around upstairs, including in your room, Buket. And she could hear everything we said downstairs. Every single word. That night, Lady İsmet was up late watching her shows when you two snuck out and came here, to the mansion. You already knew the dogs. It was easy for you to shush them, right? And then, quietly, you broke into the house. I wonder what Haşmet thought in that brief second when he saw you two? [dramatic music rising] [loud thud echoes] Haşmet's death didn't quite solve everything. There was someone else who knew about you. Doctor Çetin. [dog barking] [dramatic music rising] [Adil] So convenient, wasn't it? That he died in a freak car accident. Then there's İanna and Ranat. Your father took them to the mountains to cross the border, and then he killed them there. [wind whistling] Now it's my turn, because you haven't got it quite right. This story actually starts when Jale comes to work at the hospital. Haşmet Köseoğlu is obsessing over a certain pretty young nurse, and decides to pursue her. He even threatens to fire her if she refuses his advances. Interestingly he's not after her physical beauty. His interest is just to have a young healthy wench who will give him a son. Gül! You don't owe him this. I want to tell him. After a long time though, Haşmet Köseoğlu has still not been given the son he so desires, and he begins to make life a living hell for my mother. When it moves from divorce threats all the way into physical abuse, young Jale finds a solution... her ex-fiancé. True, the trouble began when I learned that I wasn't a Köseoğlu. Çetin, that bastard doctor, came to me first, blackmailing me for a million dollars, and another proposal even more disgusting. I reminded him that ethically he couldn't reveal those results and kicked him out of my office. But I was naive. He went to Haşmet and told him everything. That night, in a fury, Haşmet called my mother a whore, and me a bastard child. How could it be that his favorite daughter he'd been so proud of his whole life was something he could just crumple up and throw away? If you could see what he did to us, especially to my mother that night. [Buket] Also, no one murdered İanna and Ranat. They had a change of heart, all right. They didn't want to go back to Moldova. So when they were close to the end, they took the money from Timur and ran away. Then they got lost in the Strandzhas and froze to death. Even if that's true, so what? So what happens here is important! All of this wealth and the control of all those hospitals, who do you think ought to be in charge of all of this? Huh? What would Canberk do with all of this? He's gonna waste it all, getting fat again and then slimmer. He'll abuse our family name just to sleep around with women and party endlessly. He'd utterly destroy every single social responsibility project we started hoping to try and treat the less fortunate. He'll squander it all. So I ask you now, is the act... or the reason for it what matters? Righteousness? Good? Evil? They're all debatable. So, what are you gonna do? I will negotiate. I want Buket to write me out another prescription. Hmph. No chance. Hey, what kind of a killer are you? - Buket! Just give him what he wants! - No. [intriguing notes playing] [Gül] All right, fine! I'll find you a doctor to give you the prescription you want. And some money? [suspenseful music playing] What's wrong? Just like Columbo does it... One last question. Why did you hit Jale? It was an accident. My mother, being naive, tried to protect Haşmet and she got hit instead. [loud whoosh] [suspenseful music continues] [laughs heartily] [Adil sighs] I've been as half-witted as Hamlet. [exhales] That stunned Buket. She had no idea how to answer that because she wasn't there. Gülhan is the killer. [music continues] [footsteps recede] Maide told me that as a detective you were incompetent. [chuckles] [woman sniffles] [woman sobs softly] [dramatic music playing] This child is ours. [music continues] Most creative. This is... not a plan for a murder. This... [chuckles] ...is a work of art. Your egg, Gülhan? Mm-hmm. Gülhan's egg inside your twin's womb. Is it a girl? It is. [exhales] I wanted that too. But I didn't get it. The fall of some has resulted in the gift of a baby girl, huh? I won't say anything to İsmet. The legacy of the Köseoğlus will be passed onto a new lineage. Hamlet... has graced wealth with innocence. The rest is silence. [Buket laughs] [exhales shakily] DAY 9 [footsteps approaching] What's with the sudden show of affection? Get your things. We're taking you back to your aunt. You can't stay here. What's happening? We have some serious business we need to take care of. - Is it dangerous business? - Sort of. Until you hear from one of us, I don't want you to call us or text us at all. You be careful. Promise me? Promise you. Here. You keep that. [tense music playing] [bags unzipping] We're waiting for you. Are you ready? We're set to head out. [line ringing] [Sir] Wow, Mister Sadık. I'm honored. Spit it out! We'll corner Ferhat tonight. He wants to meet with the girl we set up for him. - They're gonna have dinner, then... - He'll take the girl home. Is that it? The girl will open the door to let Zeynel and Hüso in to grab him, then we'll call you. [Sir] All right, you leave that motherfucker to my guys. They'll deal with him. He'll send his dogs after us now. They're probably already on the way. Even better, they'll be divided. [cell phone chimes] He just texted me. Says "Call me. But not with Sadık around." Stay quiet. - Hello? - Am I on speakerphone? Yes, Sir. Hüso's here with me. Listen to me. Once you know where Ferhat's place is immediately grab Sadık-Adil. Make sure the phones are safe. - Then come directly back here. Got it? - Understood. All right, now we'll call Selami. This is it. [tense Western-style music playing] Move out. [weapons clattering] [engines starting] [music continues] [Zeynel] Haluk and Recep are on our tail. Selami, some of their guys are tailing us. Let's meet at that alley we talked about. All right? [suspenseful music playing] [tires squealing] [Haluk] Hey, what the hell? Who are they? Go back, go back! [glass shattering] [Haluk] What the fuck? [grunting] [grunting continues] Oh-ho! [Haluk groaning] Get their phones and passcodes. Where's your phone? Keep quiet. Yeah, hello. Uh, we're at Ferhat's place. The girl just opened up the door, Zeynel and Hüso are in. I'm in the car outside. [Sir] Good job Sadık-Adil. Don't go anywhere. All right. [cell phone chimes] Boss, this one is Haluk's phone. Just got a text. Passcode is 1234. Hayati is texting. He's asking him if you two are in. Response? He'd probably say... "Affirmative. They're in." "Affirmative. They're in." Should I send that photo of Ferhat to Sir now? Yeah. That little shit. - [cell phone rings] - It's him. Mm. Answer it. Hello. All good here, Sir. Hüso's dealing with Adil now. Yeah, all done here. All right. Huh? Haluk is here too? [Zeynel] Got it, Sir. [cell phone ringing] Evening, Hayati, sir. That's right, sir. Yes, correct, Adil's in the trunk. We took their phones and we'll be on our way soon. Yes got it, sir. My friend. Haluk, Recep? Leave them to me. [pill bottle shaking] - Hello. - [Adil] Selami. Zeynel is coming out and I want you to let him pass. He has a score to settle with those two, and after that we can leave. Yeah, the garage. Done, thanks. [Western-style music playing] - [Haluk] Zeynel, bro! - Bro, don't! - Bro, I'm begging you, man! - [Haluk] Zeynel! No! Don't do it, brother! [men screaming] [continue screaming] [muffled screaming] [two gunshots] [screaming stops] [music continues] [Zeynel grunts] I cut both of their dicks off. Then I stuffed them in their mouths. And I shot 'em both in the head. Let's go. [engines rev] [tires screeching] Are you ready, buddy? [dramatic Western-style music playing] - [shotgun blasts] - [glass shattering] - [gun cocking] - [gunshot] [guns firing] [tires screeching] [gunfire continues] [gunfire] [bullets ricocheting] - [intense tone plays] - [heart beating steadily] - [shotgun blast] - [gunfire continues] [canister rattles] [gas hissing] [man coughing] [gunfire] [thud echoes] [intense tone plays] [tense music playing] We were never here. You didn't see us, you don't know what happened. [Hüso] Chief. How about we don't burn all the cars? Let's take a few of them to the next street, so we can sell them off. [Adil] Whatever you want. GARAGE [tense music continues] [intense tone plays] [music continues] [music continues] DANGER ZONE KEEP OUT [music intensifies] [whooshing] [intense swirling music continues] [Adil] You told me I could have it when my arm had healed. [Sir] Sadık... - [intense tone plays] - [Sir groans] Help. Help me... [coughs] [gasps weakly] Help. [coughs] Call for help. Call them to come get me. [coughs] Call. Please save me. [groaning] In the safe. [coughs] There's money. The code is "Istanbul." [panting weakly] Adil. You're not the ghost I was expecting. - [gunshot] - [thuds] [uneasy music tinkling] [Adil] I'm not Hamlet anymore. NEW HEAD STREET Raskolnikov... Why did he hack Alyona Ivanovna in the head with an axe? Had he found true evil? [music continues] [inhales deeply] [inhales shakily] [Zeynel] Hey, boss? [Adil] In the safe. Ca... cash. Istanbul's the code. [music continues] Did I kill him? Yeah, you did. Come on man, we gotta get outta here. Time to go. [Adil groans] [Zeynel grunting] The chaos. The chaos, the mayhem. The chaos... [loud whoosh] [fire crackling] [Adil] "Or God..." [music continues] [laughing] [groans softly] Whoa, Chief! Come on! Let's get him out of here, Zeynel! [Hüso laughing] We made a clean sweep tonight. Everyone inside is on the dark side now. - Eight guys in total. - [laughs] [Adil] Ah, but which glory comes without a price? Eight people died in The Tragedy of Hamlet as well. [classical string music playing] [sighs] Oof. [Hüso] Ah jeez, he's lost it again. [classical music continues] [Zeynel] Ah, he's thrown up again too. He's poisoned himself, drinking whiskey on top of those pills. [Hüso] He's calling for someone. Who's he calling for, Zeynel? You have any idea? [music continues] [Buket] So that accident that you had, it certainly wasn't because your tire blew. [tranquil classical music playing] [loud rumbling] [music continues] [music ends dramatically] [seagulls calling] [Adil groans] What time is it? It's seven in the morning, still dark. - What happened? - What do you think? You poisoned yourself and almost died! Thank God you threw up, but I think you left your stomach in the toilet. Are you all right? [grunts] No more pills. We took them. - Where are the boys? - They're in the other room. You scared the hell out of us! Hüso even slept inside 'cause of you. Huh? Hey, look who's up! - No way! [laughs] - Yo, chief! Oh, it's good to see you back on your feet, you really had us worried! [chuckles] Thank goodness! Thank goodness. - You okay? - [Adil grunts] - Yeah. - We should get going then. We're gonna take all those cars to a friend of ours' garage. He's gonna sell 'em for us. Let's go. I thank God you're all right. [laughs] [seagulls calling] [sighs] Just remember... I'm not as young as you think I am so... And I'm not Sadık. Or Adil either. I'm Öcal or Hıncal. I'll let you pick a name for this new bad guy. [sensual electric blues playing] [music continues] DAY 10 Whoa! How much is it? [Zeynel] This is 325,000 dollars, 250,000 Euros, and 75,000 Turkish lira. Hmm. Give $25,000 to Maria. Okay? Split up the rest. You don't think I'm entitled to some too? - One third is yours. - [Zeynel] And cut you out, boss? No way! Four-way split. If it weren't for you, we wouldn't be dividing anything up. Right now more painkillers are all I need. - So you're forfeiting your share? - Don't need money where I'm going. Wait a minute, wait a minute, chief. You're not going anywhere without us! What am I gonna do with this money, shove It up my ass? Sorry about that. I've got a better idea anyway. Let's go into business. For Adil's... or Öcal's hotel venture! - Oh Hüso, come on! - [laughing] That's just disgusting! Maybe you should've left a few meatballs for the rest of the people in the country! I apologize. But, chief, come on! You know that we're not used to having a lady around, she's making us self-conscious about things we're used to doing - and it's damaging my ego. - [all laughing] [Pınar] You guys're the best buddies ever. [Zeynel] Sing us a folk song, Hüso. [Hüso] Oh, for God's sake. - [Pınar] Go ahead, Hüso! Sing it! - [Zeynel] Come on. Sing us a song. [Pınar] Sing it, sing it. - [voices fades] - [classical string music playing] [music ends] [spaghetti Western-style music playing] [car horn honks] My son! Welcome back! Oh, my dear! Welcome home! So good to see you, dear! - You all right? - Yes. Now that you're home! - So nice to meet you, Mama! - What Mama? What the hell? Are you out of your mind? - Stop kissing my hand! - [Adil laughs] Who're these idiots? - My brothers in arms. - That we are. Then who's the girl? Or have they started recruiting women as well? Not yet. Pınar. She wants to be our receptionist. - Pınar, welcome! - Thank you. [music continues] [music stops] [Adil sighs] [inhales] [exhales] How's this work? I'm curious... Reception's a good start. What's after that though? [laughs] I have to tell you, Mr. Öcal... In my whole life there's never been a time as intense as these last ten days have been. I guess this is what they call happiness. And I might just love you. You should know that. [birds chirping] I think I love you too, you vixen. [laughs] You sentenced me to live.
