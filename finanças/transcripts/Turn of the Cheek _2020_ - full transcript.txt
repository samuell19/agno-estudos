Come on everybody. Come on everybody. - How much is that? - It's $250. Had to spend $50 on food. - What's that supposed to do? That's not enough to catch us up on the rent. We owe $1,200. We're three months behind, the old dude said if we don't have the money by 5:00 PM tomorrow he's having the cops come over here and put us out. - Look Lee, you think I don't know that? There ain't no food in that fridge. You gone let my sin starve? Look at him! - Look at him? Look at me Cain. I didn't sign up for this. When I got with you, you was balling. Now look at you, done fell all the way off. Got me up in here taking care of your kid, in this filthy house. - Look Lia, I'm doing the best I can! You know the hook looking after us, right? Right. So you want me to go out and start robbing people, huh? - I want you to be a man and do what you gotta do to handle yours. I got somewhere to go. I can't keep living like this. What you gon' do if five o'clock come around and you don't got the money for the rent? What then? That's what I thought. - Daddy, I'm not hungry. You can take the food back to have more money. - Listen to me son, don't worry about none of that, okay? I just want you to grab yourself some food, all right? - Thank you so much for coming, I really appreciate it. Thank you so much for coming, I appreciate it. - Pastor, I really enjoyed that message today. I needed that. - Thank you, sister Green. It's always good to know not everyone was sleeping while I was teaching. - I'm sorry, pastor, I guess I stayed up a little later than I should have last night trying to get everything ready for this afternoon. - No need for apologies man. Just make sure you set me aside some of them world-famous ribs that I've been hearing about. - Yes sir, you got it. Yup. Hey sweetheart, I'ma go pull the car up for you, okay? - No, it's okay sweetie, I'm right behind you. - You sure? - Pastor, we'll see you around 4:30, right?

After all the work I did for Devon's open house, oh, we will have peace today. - Hey ma. - I swear, I don't know what to do with you sometimes. - Ma, now I can hear you fussing all the way outside. - Don't you start with me Daniel. People will start arriving here in about an hour and nothing's ready. - Everything is fine ma. - No, it's not. The balloons still needs to be placed and the food set out and then I need... Oh my God, I forgot the ice? Out of all the things in the world I could have forgotten, how did I forget the ice? Now the drinks are gonna be warm. Where are my keys? - Mom, stop. - Daniel, stop it. I got to go to the store and grab some ice before... - I'll run to the store and grab some ice. Calm down. Jesus. - I swear, I don't know what I'm gonna do when you leave. - Oh, here we go. - Stop it. Don't do make fun of me. This was hard. You will see when you have kids of your own. - Kids? - Well, one day.

You're gonna continue to, you gon' take up that boy and put his whole life. He gon' have to do something. Jesus. - Excuse me, could you point us in the direction of Mr and Mrs. Green. - Yes sir, how can I help you? - Mr Green, is it possible that you could step aside and talk to you and your wife privately. - Sure, you can follow me inside. - Thank you. - Debbie, hey. These guys need to talk to us. Yeah, I mean I don't know. - Detectives? - That's what he said baby, I don't know. - What's wrong? Where's Daniel? - Mr and Mrs Green, I'm detective Ferguson, this is my partner detective Dawson. I'm sorry to tell you that there was an attempted robbery up the street at the party store. Daniel Green is your son? Seems that he attempted to stop the robber who was trying to rob a woman. - No. - Baby. What's he saying baby. - Seems to be a scuffle ensued and a gun went off and he was shot in the stomach. I'm sorry, he didn't make it. - what are you... - What are you saying man, what are you saying man. - Hey, what's wrong? - We need to put everything in this bag, we gotta go. Where's Jacob at? - He's sleep. What do you mean get packed? What did you do? - Come on son, we gotta go. - Cain, what's going on? - Look Lia, I think I killed somebody. The cops could be here any second. I don't know how many people seen me. - What? - Look, I ain't got time to explain nothing to you. Do what I tell you, get in the car. - Who did you kill? How could you be so stupid. - Look Lia, you said we needed money, right? So that's what I did. You wanted me to handle my stuff like a man, right? And now we gotta go. Stop talking and do what I tell you! - You know what? I'll get my stuff. - Yeah. - But you're crazy if you think I'ma be on the run with you and your kid! - Get out of here then! - I'm out! - Get down! - Be still. - It was a beautiful service. What now? - Oh Daniel. Oh Daniel. I just don't know. Oh I just don't know. What do you do when you've just the body of your only child. Oh Daniel it's just not fair. Oh God, it's just not right. Oh Daniel. - Next up on the docket, it's the people versus Cain Vasquez in the case of Daniel Green. Mr. Vasquez, you had been found guilty of murder in the second degree, a second charge of armed robbery and today you will be sentenced. Now the family has waived their right to speak at these proceedings therefore we will move right into your sentence. Looking at your record, I see that you've been in and out of jail for drugs, gang activity and weapons charges. I for one would like to say that it is a very sad day when such a fine young man with such a bright future is sacrificed at the hands of the likes of you. Someone who has nothing of value to offer a society. Do you have anything to say for yourself, Mr. Vasquez? - What's gon' happen to my son? - Now you're worried about your son? Why weren't you worried about what would happen to your son before you decided to go out and rob and then kill someone. Talk about priorities. What will happen to your son is none of your concern, Mr. Vasquez. That is now at the pleasure of the state. I just hope and pray they will be able to find them a home with someone who can counteract all the damage that you've done. Now, on the first count of murder in the second degree, this court hereby sentences you to 40 years of imprisonment in a Michigan state correctional facility. On the second count of armed robbery, this court hereby sentences you to 15 years in a Michigan state correctional facility. Both of these sentences are to be served consecutively and will begin immediately. Mr and Mrs. Green, I truly wish there was more I could do. I'm sorry. This court's adjourned. Bailiff, get this prisoner out of my sight. - Jacob, listen to me Jacob. Listen to me, come here. Come here. Stop crying. What'd I tell you about that? You're a man. Real men do what they gotta do, they don't cry about it. Tears don't change nothing. They're never gonna change anything. You remember that. Daddy has to go away for a while. There's nothing that neither one of us could do about it so I need you to stop crying. You hear me? So I need you to start lying how you gon' live your life outside of this. Daddy can't help you now. You're a man. - But I love you, daddy. - I love you too. Now let me do what I gotta do. - I think this belongs to you. - It's not mine. The lady gave it to me to play with but I don't feel like playing right now. - Well, I'll just sit it right here next to you so that if you change your mind, you know where it is. - Thank you, Ms Lady. My daddy said I'm not supposed to cry but he's going away and I can't stop my eyes from crying. - Excuse me, excuse me. - Oh baby, excuse me, excuse me. - Come on sweetheart. It's time to go. - I don't think I've ever felt hatred the way I felt it today when I saw that man. - I wanted to kill him. Lord forgive me, but I wanted to. - I know. I can't stop thinking about that little boy. I mean, it's not his fault his father is a criminal. And now he has to go into a system that'll probably take away all of his innocence. - Yeah. Well, we better get some rest. You have a long day ahead of you tomorrow. - Goodnight honey, I love you. - Love you too. - Come in Deborah. - Hello, pastor. - Hey, how are you doing? Have a sit. - Thank you for seeing me on such short notice. - There's no need for that, that's what I'm here for. How are you and Thomas doing? It's been a few months and we're gonna miss you guys. - We're doing. - Well, just to let you know, if you guys are ready to come back, we'll be waiting here with open arMs - Thank you pastor. The reason for my visit today is I wanted to get your opinion on something. - Of course, anything I could do to help, I'm here. - Well, ever since the sentencing for Daniel's killer, I've been having some very conflicting feelings. - What kind of feelings. - On one hand, extreme anger and hatred towards Cain Vasquez. All I can think about is how I want him to suffer. And on the other hand, I can't stop thinking about his little boy. - I see. - I know I should have just kept this to myself, I'm sorry to have bothered you. - No, Deborah, Deborah, no. Please have a seat. Please. Listen. Deborah, you just experienced the loss of your only son. So the hatred you feel towards his killer is only natural. It's not what God wants, but it's natural. So what we have to do is help you find a way to get past the hatred so we can find forgiveness for the one that wronged you. - I'm not sure I can do that. - No, you can't. In your own strength, you can't find it in your heart to forgive something of that magnitude. With our Lord and savior Jesus Christ, all things are possible. - I know pastor, but I have to get past being angry with God before I can move on to forgiving the man he allowed to kill my son. - I do appreciate your honesty. So with that, I motion we come back to that. But you mentioned this boy. Tell me about it. - I can't stop thinking about him. For the past few weeks, every time I think about him going into the system, my heart aches. It's like I feel like I got to do something. - Did you talk to Thomas about this? - No. - Did you pray about it? - No. - Those are two things right there that I would have at the top of my to-do list. Deborah listen, I know that you're still in pain but if you put your trust in the Lord, He will do things far beyond what you can imagine. - Thank you pastor for taking out the time to speak with me. - Of course. May we pray before you leave? - I don't think I'm ready yet. Maybe next time. - Okay, but Deborah, just know that I'll be praying for you, okay? And yes, He allowed your only son to be taken from you, but understand that he gave his only son for you. - What you're doing here Lia? - I wanted to come a while ago, but I was scared. I feel so bad about how everything turned out. And I wanted to say, I'm sorry. I know that doesn't change anything. - What's done is done. It is what it is. You said, you're sorry. I don't want to see you back up here. - Cain, why you gotta be like that? - Be like what? You let my son get put in the system, right? After everything I did for you, you couldn't even take care of my son, man? - What? Take care of a kid? I barely have a place to lay my head Cain, how I'm supposed to take care of a kid? - Yeah, you're right. There ain't nothing else to talk about then. - Please don't be like that Cain. I know you don't have anybody else. Let me do something for you. Let me put some money on your books. - Yeah? You wanna do something for me? Find out where my son is. Other than that I want nothing from you. Guards, take me back to my cell. - Hey, how was your visit? - What you in my business for? - Bro, no disrespect. Just trying to make conversation. - Hey every time I pass by this cell you got your nose buried in that book, man. You know it ain't nothing but some white man's BS anyway. - Really? - Yeah, really. - How you know? You ever read it? - No, and I don't need to. I'm too busy living real life. - Oh really, it's too bad bro. You don't know what you're missing. - Whatever. - I dig, you ever want to know more about it, you're more than welcome. I'm right here. - Yeah? Whatever man. - Detective Ferguson, detective Ferguson? - Hey. - Hi. I stopped by because I wanted to talk to you about a private matter. Do you have a moment? - Yeah, come on, sure. Come on into my office. So what can I do for you? - I wanted to see if you could help me find someone. - I can drop, is it someone missing? - No, I'd like to find a little boy from the trial. The son of Cain Vasquez. - I'm a little lost. Why would you wanna do that? - Well, seeing him in his reaction to losing his dad, I mean he was so little and I just felt really bad for him. I'd like to meet him if I could. I don't know, something about him really touched my heart. I can't explain it, but I'd like to do something. - Like what, Mrs Green? - I don't know. - Are you sure that's a good idea? I mean, does your husband know you're here? - No, he doesn't. So will you help me? - Is everything all right babe? - What? Yeah, yeah. Well, there was something I wanted to talk to you about. - What's wrong? - I went to see detective Ferguson today. - About what? - I wanted to find out about the boy. - Boy? What boy? - From the trial? Vasquez's son. - Why would you wanna go and do that? - I don't know. Ever since we saw him in the hallway, I can't stop thinking about him. I mean, it just hurts my heart that the innocent little boy is gonna have to go into the system over something he had no control over. - That's not our problem, Debbie. You need to let it go. - I know... - I said let go! Look,. - Ma'am, I just wanna see my caseworker so I can set up my next appointment. - Could you mail me? Look, I've told you a million times already that you need to fill out a request form in order to see your case worker. - And I've already been here a million times before and you never made me do that. - Well today is a brand new day, baby girl. If you'd like to see your case worker, you're gonna fill out this request form and bring it back to me because we do not have time to cater to your needs. So here you go boo. Okay. Debra Green. - I'm Deborah Green. - Hi, Mrs Green, Ms White will see you now. If you go down that hallway, her office is a second door on the right. Come in. Hi Mrs. Green, have a seat. Hi Ms White, thank you so much for seeing me. - Oh, no problem at all. So what brings you in today? - I wanted to find out if it could be possible for me to meet Cain Vasquez's son. I know it seems like a really strange request, but ever since we saw him in the hallway that day after the trial, he's been heavily on my mind. Does he have any family? - No. I mean, that's why he's here with us, but Mrs. Green, this is a highly irregular request. I mean... - Ms White, I know it seems really strange for me to come in here, asking to see the son of the man who murdered my son. - Yes. - But as much as I've tried for the past few months to forget about him, I keep seeing his face and the tears running down his cheek. And it breaks my heart. It's killing me to think of that little boy getting lost in this messed up system, all because of the sins of his father. So I thought maybe if I could spend some time with him, I don't know what I thought, but I thought I'd try. - Okay. Okay, Mrs Green, I'll let you see him. But only for 30 minutes only, okay? Now listen, if you upset him in any way, I'll have to make you leave. - Thank you. I understand. Thank you so much. - Okay. Well, follow me and I'll get you situated and I'll get Jacob. Jacob, this is Mrs Green, remember her from the courtroom? She wanted to come see how you were doing. - Hello Jacob, it's nice to officially make your acquaintance. - Go ahead baby, it's okay. Go ahead, have a seat. - How have you been Jacob? - Good. - Have you made any new friends here? - No, the other kids don't really talk to me that much. - Oh well, I'm sure they'll come around. I brought you something. I remember you had one like it but you said it wasn't yours. But now you have one that's your very own. - Just for me? - Yes sweetie, just for you. - Jacob, what do you say? - Thank you Ms Lady. - You're very welcome. Hey, do you want to play a game? - I don't really know how to play games that much. - That's okay, I'll teach you. Thank you again for letting me see him. - Oh, no problem at all. He seemed to really enjoy the visit. - I did too. Would it be okay if I came back? I'd like to see him again. - Sure. No problem. You know what? I'll go ahead and make the arrangement to get you on his approved list. That's gonna take about a week, but I'll give you a call and once it's approved. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Take care. - Come on. I know you see me standing here. - What y'all want man? - What I want. It ain't even about what I want, it's about what it is. See it's my understanding you were affiliated with the West Side squad, correct? - Who's that? - This guy's funny, he don't know nothing. Don't play dumb, we know who you rocking with. And ain't none of your boys up in here. I personally make sure of that. - East side, homie. - Snitch. Hey, sleeping beauty, welcome back. - How long I been up here? - Over 24 hours. Stitch you up real good. Gave you something so you could sleep. They got you pretty good, huh? - Yeah, but it's all right. I'll get on my feet, I got so for them. - I bet you do. But then, they gon' have something else for you. And the vicious cycle continues. Go back and forth till one of you is dead. Sound about right? - No man. Not my version. My version, all three of them dead. - Oh yeah? And their crew gon' come looking for you. And you crew gon' come looking for them and so on and so forth. Vicious cycle I was talking about. When does it end? The Bible says "Vengeance is mine, "I will repay." - You came over here to preach to me? Listen, I need no move from no preacher, man. Don't you got some piss to clean up? - Yeah, I do. Let me ask you something. Don't you find it odd that you got stabbed in the same place you shot that kid? I do too. Anyway, if you can tell me book, chapter and verse I just quoted from the Bible, I'll give you $5 from my commissary. - All right. - So, what's the next step? - Next step for what? - Jacob. He's been here for more than six months. How does the process go for a child his age? - Well, it's our goal to place our children with good families who will love them and provide a stable environment for them to grow up in. But unfortunately it just doesn't always happen for kids Jacob's age. - Why aren't the other kids playing with him? - I don't know. He's really a sweet kid. He is shy, he keeps to himself. He really enjoys the interaction of the other kids but sometimes he's content with just being by himself. Now the kids, they don't bother him or anything, they seem to know when he doesn't want to play. Seems to get lost in his thoughts. - What about his dad? - What about him? - Does he ever get to see his dad? - No, but he does ask about him a whole lot. He's so far away so he doesn't get a chance to see him or anything like that. But I do try to help him write a letter to him at least once a month, you know? And he hasn't written them back yet, which really sucks. But I try to do what I can. - That's all you can do. - Yeah. - Well, well, if it ain't the little homie Cain. How you feeling bruh? - I'm all right. Surprised not to see you nose buried in that book. - Yeah, yeah, got some great sermons from this program I've been gonna on this little audio player. - Yeah? - Yeah. You can have my pillow, until you get a little better. Wouldn't want you tearing your lady parts. - Thank you. - What was that? - Man I said, thank you. - You're welcome bruh. - Hey, how much you got? I saw a letter waiting for you to come. - Where's it? - Hey babe. - Hey. Where have you been? - Oh you know, just running my usual Saturday errands. Nothing unusual. - I noticed a few strange charges on the account. A few from Toys "R" Us. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Debbie, you've been gonna see that boy again, haven't you? - Yes. Yes I have, so what? - I thought I told you to let it go. - I can't. I tried to come and talk to you about it but you wouldn't listen. I've been spending time with him and... - And what? What? - And I want to bring him home. To be with us. - You mean to tell me that you want to bring the son of the man who killed our son into this house? - Yes. His name is Jacob and he's an innocent little boy who got caught in the middle of something that had nothing to do with him. He's an innocent bystander in this, just like us. His case worker, Ms White, at the Family Services Center has been allowing me to see him several times a week and I just feel in my heart of hearts that he's supposed to be here, with us. I can't explain it. It's just something I can't let go of. I have an appointment to see him again this week. Maybe if you just came and you met him... - No! I would never betray the memory of my son, our son! How can you see the son of the man who murdered him? How could you do that Debbie? What is wrong with you? - Tommy... - No! Listen, I don't wanna hear anything else about it. You entertain that boy then that's on you. I don't wanna hear anything else about it. You just don't get it, do you? You wanna do something, think about my son, my son, Daniel. - The Bible is filled with examples of people in situations that God uses to fulfill his purposes. Welcome. - Well, well, look what the cat dragged in. Welcome brother. - They said it's this or cleanup bathrooMs I'm not gonna clean up no bathrooMs - I bet. - Listen, God is no respect of persons. Moses and King David were both greatly used by God and yet they were both murderers. God used Moses to write the first five books of the Bible, David was a man after God's own heart. Jacob was a liar and yet he was a child of promise and God used him to establish the 12 tribes of Israel and the list goes on. - And that makes sense to you, huh? - Do you care to elaborate on that, Mr... - Cain. My name is Cain. Yes, I'd like to elaborate pastor. So you mean to tell me that this God y'all talking about using liars, murderers, thieves to accomplish all His plans? I don't buy none of that. - But before I try to help you understand, do you believe that the Bible is the word of God? - I never read no Bible, man. - So how can I make you understand if you don't know anything about it. - From what you up here telling me, and what I'm hearing from all of y'all, God's supposed to be this big, all-seeing Holy entity and He looking down on all of us, judging us for everything that we do wrong? That don't make no sense. Why he used the liars and murderers? - What if I told you that liars and murderers and sinners were the only people that existed in this world and God sent his only son, Jesus Christ. He did die for you and I. - No, that sounds stupid to me. I'm a father, pastor. I ain't about to send my son to die for nobody. We're supposed to protect our kids. - That's very true. And that's the amazing thing about God. And as a Holy God, he cannot and will not tolerate sin. So for sinful people like you and I, it was the perfect sacrifice. So He can take all that sin away. - How's that supposed to help me, pastor? I'm sitting in here for the rest of my life. - Because of Jesus Christ, now you know that your sins can be forgiven. All you have to do is believe that Jesus Christ is the son of God. Repent your sins and let God into your heart to save you. - Hey, I ain't listening to this BS. I'm gon' go clean me a bathroom. Catch you later pastor. - Mr. Cain. - You're getting pretty good at this game. Jacob, can I ask you a question? - Yes. - Do you know what happened to your mommy? - Yes. - What happened to her? - She died when I was born. - Oh, I see. - Excuse me, Deborah, can I see you outside for a moment please? - Sure. Honey, I'll be right back, okay? Is everything okay? - Yes. There's someone who would like to speak with you for a moment. I'm gonna leave you to some privacy. But Deborah, when you're ready, just come back in. I'll keep Jacob some company till you're back, okay? - Hi. - Hi. - What are you doing here? - I got to thinking about what you said and I overreacted. The truth is, I haven't been sleeping very well. - Me neither. - So I thought that maybe I should look past all the pain and try to see the whole picture. So for the first time in a long time, I got on my knees and I prayed. Then I prayed some more and Debbie I... - Thank you so much. I know this was hard for you. It was hard for me too at first. I was so angry but something kept pulling me back. And now? Now it's like I can't stay away. Would you like to meet him? - Sure. - Do you have a four? - Jacob sweetie, I have someone I want you to meet. - Who? - My husband. His name is Thomas Green. - Nice to meet you Thomas Green. Would you like to play a little with me? - Sure. - So, what did you think? - I like him. I like him a lot, more than I wanted to. - I felt the exact same way. The first day I went there, I didn't wanna like him. I wanted him to this little gremlin kid so I'd have a reason to walk away and felt like I had done my part by gonna see him but it was the exact opposite. - So what now? - Well, if it's okay with you, I'd like to bring them home for a weekend visit. Ms White already gave me the clearance, but I didn't want to do it without your permission. So I never got back to her about it. Honey, you don't have to do it. I'm so thankful for the fact that you came down there to meet him. That was a huge step for you. So I won't pressure you. I'll just keep gonna see him at the center. - You know what? Let's do it. I'd be lying If I said I didn't enjoy spending time with him today. - Really? - Really. - Thank you. - Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give unto wrath, for it is written, vengeance is mine. "I will repay," says the Lord, Romans 12:19 I want my $5 of that commissary CJ. - Tell me a good joke Jacob. - Knock, knock. Who's there? Glasses. Glasses who? I don't really know. - What? I didn't get that one Jacob. - Yeah, I know. - We are here. - Whoa, you live here? - Yes, we live here. - Wow, is this a mansion? - No sweetie, it's not a mansion. Come on. Come on. Let's sit your bag down here. We are gonna have so much fun. We're gonna go to the movies and swimming and then we're gonna play laser tag. How does that sound? - I've never done that stuff before. - Oh, well that's okay. - Okay Ms Lady. - Jacob, I told you you don't have to call me that. You can call me Deb, Ms Debbie. - Okay, Ms Lady. - Well guys, we have a busy day ahead of us so we better get going. What do you say about that, Jake? Is it okay if I call you that? - Yeah. - All right, let's go. That boy was knocked out. He didn't wake up once. We had a good time though. - I'm exhausted myself. I forgot how much energy little kids have. He wore me out. - Gotta tell you though, reminds me when Daniel was young. Don't know how to feel about all this babe. - I know, I know. - Well, I'ma head over to bed, all right? - All right babe. - You have a good night. - You too. - Don't stay up too late. Seriously, don't stay up too late. - I won't. Good morning Jacob. Are you hungry? I made some bacon and eggs. - Yes please. - Morning babe. - Good morning. - Morning Jake. - Morning. - You sleep all right? - Yes. - Good. Looking good sweetheart, looking good. Thank you. Pretty good huh? There's more to go. - Jacob, today I thought maybe you'd like to go to the science center. How does that sound? - Good. May I be excused? - Sure. Go ahead and get dressed. We'll be leaving soon. - Kids. - Yo CJ, what you in here for anyway man? - Cain, we been here almost a year, you're just not asking me what I'm in here for? - Well, guess I didn't care before. - Oh, you care now? - All right listen, I ain't saying all that but I gotta wonder what a Bible-thumbing cat like you did to get up in here. - Well, I wasn't always a Bible thumber Cain. Used to be chief head thumper, - Head thumper? That still ain't answer my question, man. - Yeah? That's really all you need to know. I was young, dumb, did a lot of stupid stuff, man. I'm here for the rest of my life. End of story. - What made you turn to that Bible over there? - God's gracious for showing me the Bible. That's the only thing give me hope in a place like this. I know I can never do anything to make up for all the wrong I did, but with Jesus, feel like I got a second chance you know? So whether I'm in here on the outside, I'll spread the gospel. - Yeah, that's real dawg. What if nobody in here wants to hear the gospel? - Not my problem. It's my job to plant the seed, God's job to grant the increase. Everybody got choices, bro. Even in here. So you can choose to learn from your mistakes or choose to be damned. - Man, you sound crazy. - You can call it what you want, bro. Cain. - What's up? - When are you gonna get the courage to write your son? - Man, what? Hey man, don't worry about my son. - Come on man. I got two kids out there, bro. Wish I knew where they was so I could write them a letter. You know what I would do? I would kill to get a letter from my kids, man. - What I'ma say? I've got nothing to say to him, man. Listen, I failed my son, end of story. What he need to do is forget about me and start learning how he's gonna live his life out there. - If you say so bro. But you and I both know you don't mean that. - Whatever dawg. I'm going back to sleep. - Is this your son? - Yes sweetie. This is our son Daniel. But he's gone now. - 'Cause my daddy killed him? - Yes. - Guess it's all my fault that my daddy killed your son. I was hungry and he didn't have enough money. So he went to go buy more and then when he got back he was really yelling and then the cops came and it's all my fault. It really is. - Hey, hey, it's not your fault. Look at me, it's not your fault your daddy did what he did. So you don't ever have to say that again. Okay? - Okay. - Hey. We said no tears, okay? Let's go downstairs and brush your teeth and get ready for bed and I'll read you a story. How does that sound? - Good. - Okay. - Hi, how can I help you? - I was thinking if I could speak with the caseworker for Jacob Vasquez. - Who are you? - A friend of the family. - Do you have an appointment? - No. - I'm sorry, but without an appointment you can't see one of our case workers. - You don't understand. I need to see that he's doing okay for his dad. - I totally understand but what you're not understanding is our caseworkers are very busy so without an appointment, you can't see one. But if you'd like to fill out this form, bring it back to me and I'll make an appointment for you. Or you can call the number at the bottom of the form and someone will call you within 48 hours. - Thought I told you not to come back up here Lia. - I know but... - What? - I did what you asked me to do. I went to check up on Jacob. - What? You saw Jacob? - Yes. A couple of days ago, I went to family services to see if I could speak with the case worker to get some information for you and they wouldn't let me see her without an appointment. Then as I'm getting ready to go, he pulls up with some lady that's taking him back in the building. - Some lady? What you mean some lady? What she look like? - I don't know, mid to late thirties, pretty. And by the way she dressed, it look like she has some money. - Well how was Jacob though? - He looked happy. He was smiling. He looked healthy. Cain, I said he looked happy. - Guard, it's time for me to go, my business over. - What? I do what you ask me and then drive four hours all the way up here and that's all I get? - What do you want from me Lia? I don't to have anything else to give you. Thanks for checking on my son. - Hey. - Hey yourself. - Man, there's something I haven't seen in a while. - What's that? - That beautiful smile of yours that I fell in love with. I've missed it. - I've missed having it. Feels good. - That little boy is something isn't he? - Yes he is. - It's been really nice to have him here these past few weeks. His energy, his youth. I have to admit he wears me out. - Yeah, me too. And here I was still thinking I was in pretty good shape. - It feels right having him here with us. - What are you saying? - I'm saying honey, it's been a really hard decision to come to but it feels right. - Really Tommy? - I prayed about it and I believe it's in God's plans for our lives. Have you prayed about it? - No. I can't say that I have. I want to. I know you're struggling baby but we have to be on accord in this. - I know. I'm trynna find my way back Tommy. Really I am. - So what now? - I don't know. I'll call Ms White in the morning. Let's figure out what the next step is. What do you mean you have to consider Cain Vasquez's parental rights? He's a murderer. He was sentenced to life in prison. He doesn't have any rights. - Unfortunately, Ms Green, Jacob's father does have certain rights. - He hasn't even had any contact with him in over a year. This is ridiculous. - Calm down, Debbie. - So you mean to tell me this man who murdered our son in cold blood gets to make the decision as to whether his child becomes a permanent ward of the state, instead of going to a good home where he'd be loved and cared for? - Look, Ms Green, I understand how frustrating this is, I do, but you have to understand we have some rules that we have to follow. And sitting here complaining about them is not gonna change anything. How about we focus on starting the process? - Sorry. So what happens now? - Well, you all have been having a successful weekend visits with Jacob for the few months now. I'm pretty sure I can get you approved to be foster parents. I have a great relationship with the powers that be so I'm pretty confident I can get them home with you on a more permanent basis. - So what does that mean? - It means that Jacob will be able to stay with you while we go through the adoption process. Now I will have to do some followup visits on a weekly basis for a month or so, but then it will switch to once a month, as long as things are going well. - So how long will that take to happen? - Well, normally it takes anywhere from 60 to 90 days, but like I said, I'm pretty confident I can get it done in two weeks or less. Listen, it's our goal to place children in good homes. And I have taken a special interest in Jacob. I have watched him. He is so happy when he see you walk through the door. He's so sad when we have to come back after the weekends. That baby has been through a lot. I really want to see this happen for him. - Can we tell him? - No. Why don't we wait to make sure that the foster care is approved first, okay? I'm afraid if we tell them now, it'll only confuse him when you bring him back after the weekend. Give me about two weeks to get everything done and then I'll jumped on the adoption papers. Now listen, it's gonna be a lot of things you're gonna have to sign. There's gonna be an extensive background check then we have to wait to see if his father sign off on his parental rights. This adoption process, it's not gonna be easy nor will it be quick, but I will do what I can for you. - Thank you Ms White. - Thank you for everything you've done. - Don't thank me yet. Are you praying people? - Why do you ask? - Because I just believe that you should get God about in every major decision you have in your life. - Thank you again. - You're welcome. - We look forward to hear from you soon. - All right. - Well, well, well, if it isn't Mr West side connection himself. Good thing for you this time, I'm gonna finish what we started. You really shouldn't have did that, I was just gonna have a little fun with you. I was just gonna cut you a little bit, put our brand on you, have some fun, but now, now you got to die. - I wouldn't do that if I was you. Get off him! - This ain't got nothing to do with you, it's between me and him. - Well I just made it about me. So not what? - Like I said, it's between me and him. We cool. - Thought that'd be the route you take. What's you still doing here? Let's go! Cain, you good? - Yeah, I'm straight. Go back to the rock. T Money gonna finish your mopping. Yeah, that's right. But you ain't know, let's go! - You know I owe you right? - Yeah, you do. - What you need from me? - Lockdown. - I'll let you know when the time come. - Hey man, how you about to be all gangster one second and be reading the Bible the next door though? - That's a gift. - It's a gift, huh? - That's right. - What happened to all that Vengeance is mine. - It do say that but King David was a gangster, bro. He was a Holy gangster for God. I mean... - Stop lying dawg. - Well I'm serious bro say it right here in Samuel II. - All right man, whatever. But look, - What's up? - Got me a letter man. - Word? - Yeah, they trying to take away my parental rights. My son. You know, I ain't done much right in my life man. My son though, he's the only thing I did get right. Now they trying to take it away from me. - Did you write him back? - No, man. What I'ma say? Hey son, food is horrible, it stink, everybody keep trying to kill me up in here. But yeah, keep your head up. No. Even if I do decide to go through, give up my rights, that's it, there ain't no coming back from that. So if there is some chance that I do get up out this hell hole, I might not never see Jacob again. But hey, maybe you can holla at your God about that for me. - Thomas! Thomas! Thomas! Thomas! Thomas! - What? - They approved us. - What? - We got approved. - Calm down, what are you talking about? - They approved us for foster care, he can stay. - Oh my God, yes! Oh yes! - Where's Jacob, let's tell him. Jacob? Sweetie? Come here for a second? - Jake, Jake, come here man. - Yeah? - There is something we wanted to talk to you about. We've been waiting for a couple of weeks to talk to you about something because we wanted to make sure that everything was okay. - And we just got the confirmation we needed in the mail. - And not that we know for sure we wanted to ask if you wanted to come and live with us. - Forever? - Well, Jake we're working on that part but you'll be here us for now. And that means you'll be here with this every day instead of just on the weekends. Would you like that? - Yes sir. I always wanted a mommy. Now I get to have a new dad since my daddy's gone. - Oh yes. - Honey, why is all of this in your drawer? - So I'll never be hungry. - Jacob, it's okay. Sweetie, I'm not mad. I just wanna know why you have all that food in your drawer. - So I'll never be hungry. - Are you hungry, sweetie? Aren't you getting enough to eat? - Yes, but there'll be one day there won't be enough food in the house, that's why I got it so you won't have to spend more money. - Oh baby, you don't ever have to worry about that, okay? You can eat what ever we have in this house and as much as you want. And if we run out of food, we'll go to the store and buy more. So you don't have to hide food anymore, okay? Hey, it's okay. I love you and I forgive you. Hey, why you hiding your face? I'm not mad, we're just talking. - My daddy said I'm not supposed to cry and he's gone away and I can't stop my eyes from crying. - Hey, can I tell you something? It's okay for real men to cry sometimes. Crying is what cleanses all of the bad stuff out of our souls. If you hold it in too much, it might make you sick. - Does Mr Thomas cry? - Sometimes, if he's really sad. - Like when your son died? - First thing in the morning when you wake up I want you to put all this stuff back in the kitchen. Okay? - Okay Ms Lady. - I am so glad to hear that Jacob is doing so well in his new school. - Yes, he is so smart. Tommy wants to put them in basketball this summer. - Okay. - Have you heard anything back from his father? - Well, actually I have. And that's why I called you in today. Cain Vasquez still refuses to sign off on his parental rights. - Why? - Listen Ms Green, I totally understand why you feel the way you feel about him. But we have to look at the bigger picture. If it were you, would you want to sign off on your parental rights of your child? - It shouldn't matter what he wants. It's his own fault he's locked up in there. Is there anything else we can do? Well, we can petition the courts and they'll set up a hearing and that could take up to months, even years. - I don't care what it takes. - If he wants a fight then we'll give him a fight. - Okay, I'll get the ball rolling. - I'll have our attorney call you tomorrow. - Yeah. - What's all that noise about? - Well, thought it was time that I get back into the weekly Bible study and I thought Jake might like the children's chapel and he did. Then we went to get ice cream. - I see. - All right, Jake get on up, brush your teeth and get ready for bed, okay? - Can I have a story? - You can have a story. Is everything all right? - He won't sign off on his parental rights. - I see. Listen sweetheart, I truly believe that everything is gonna be all right. Besides, God put this in your heart to pursue this thing so we just gonna have the trust and He'll see us through. - I know, I just feel so helpless. I mean, anything can happen. - You're absolutely right, anything can happen. But if there's one thing I do know this for sure. Anything that is supposed to happen will happen. Are you ready to pray about it with me? - I'm still not ready yet. I'm sorry. - Hello? Hi Ms White. How are you doing? - Hi Ms Green, I'm well, thanks for asking. Listen, I'm calling because we got a court date. The preliminary hearing is set for 90 days from now. - Okay, thank you. - Cain, it's good to see you. What brings you over this fine day? - You know cleaning bathrooms wasn't working out. - Well, I'm glad to have you. So let's get started. We were talking about turning the cheek as mentioned in Matthew five, as it relates with forgiveness and learning how to deal with the wrongs that people do to us. So the question I want to start off with today is what is the one thing that you're holding onto? Okay, if you can let go, I know you guys are dealing with a lot. If you can let go of one of those things, what would it be? Who would like to go first? - I'm holding on to something pastor. - Go ahead CJ. - Been holding on to a lot of anger, a lot of hatred. See my mother was a crack head and my father? Never knew my father. I hated them both. I hang with some cats in the neighborhood, before you knew it I was in a gang with a natural talent for violence in numbers so it's right that I ran my own gang. Money started coming in from running girls and drugs. I decided to start a family of my own. Three boys, by three different women too. I loved them all, do believe that bro. Real love. I loved being a father, always said I would be for my kids what my parents weren't for me. I know, wouldn't be the kind of life I was living. Family had something to get used to. One day, I was playing ball at the park with my boys and out of nowhere shots rained down. So as I hurry up grabbed the two boys that was closes to me and got them down. On the other side of the court, my baby boy was playing with his little ball. It was too late. I killed my baby boy. They killed my son. They got him. So you know how we do, strapped up and we went hunting. And don't get me wrong, all the dirt I done done in my life pastor it's always been business, never personal. But this had become personal. Caught up with the people responsible for killing my son. Only 16, 17 years old themselves. They was kids they still. I didn't care. I had my crew tie them up, strip them down, I made them leave. I killed those kids one by one and I didn't feel a thing. Nothing at all. That's how they caught me, got sloppy when I killed those kids. It didn't matter to me 'cause I got my revenge. Funny thing about it, it made me feel no better. Didn't bring back my son. I ain't never said none of that out loud. - How'd you get past that hatred? - I started coming here. And the first time I came you said something about God's forgiveness and the love of Jesus Christ. It's like someone was pulling in my heart, couldn't sleep. I wanted to know more about it. And you shared the gospel with me, pastor. I was able to give my life to Christ, gave it all away. All the pain, all the hurt, all the anger, hatred, gave it all to him. Like a huge weight been lifted off my shoulders. Don't get me wrong, bro, prison is a nasty, disgusting, filthy place to be, man. And sometimes we gotta do things in here to survive that ain't very Christlike. But if this is the only way I can get to him, I take my lows up with no complaints. Look forward to seeing my baby boy again in paradise Until then, just hope He you use me to help others. That's all pastor. - Well, thank you for sharing that with us CJ. Would any of you guys like to go next? - Man, I can't believe this. - What? - Man the boy I shot, man his parents are trying to get rights to my son, man. - What? Let me see that. - Here. Oh man. They trying to get back at my son what I did to their son. I know they are. - Yo chill out, man. What if they're looking at this as a chance to give a kid with no family a home? - What? Man, no. I'd rather have my son get put in the system than deal with them. - Oh you know how great the system is for minority men. In and out of jail till you're locked up for the rest of your life? That sounded like you don't it? - Man shut up man. I know I got rights. I'm gonna get rights from my son. - Hey man, your rights don't got nothing to do with this and you know it. You just scared your son go grow up hating you 'cause of what you did to their son. - What? Man shut up. I'm warning you. - Or what? You gon' hit me 'cause I'm telling you the truth? I told you man, I'm trying to curve this violent thing but I'm real good at it Cain, you hear me? You're son's gon' always be your son but you can't do nothing for him in here, you understand that? - Get off me man. - You're taking away a chance at a better life for your son 'cause you scared he gon' grow up hating you is selfish. And if you do that, it's gonna haunt you the rest of your life. You got to let it go, Cain. Let it go, man. Let it go and forgive yourself bro. Look man, I'm sure you did all you could for your son when you was out there and I'm sure he always gonna remember that Cain. What you gotta do is keep doing it for him. You gotta give him a chance at a life that you didn't have. Come on bro. And don't swing on me again. God's still working on me but that's the only warning you get. - Okay Jake, it's time for bed. - Can I have a story? - Only if you're in bed with teeth brushed by the time I come down there. - Okay. - Goodnight dude. Are you ready for tomorrow? - As ready as I'll ever be, I guess. - You'll have him on video feed, are you ready for that? - I guess I have no choice but to be, right? - You'll be fine. - Once upon a time, there was a lonely kid and he had no friends... What's wrong? - Do you think Jerry will ever forgive the boys that are being mean to him? - I think so. He seems like a nice kid and I'm sure his friend Alana will be there to encourage him. - Ms Lady... - Jacob, when are you gonna stop calling me that? Please call me Ms Deb, auntie Deb. Anything but that. - Okay Ms Lady. Can I ask you a question? - Always. - The lady at church today said that Jesus forgives other people who beat him and killed him on the cross, is that true? - It sure is. That's what the Bible says. And the Bible is God's word. I believe what it says is true. - Ms Lady, do you think you'll ever forgive my daddy for, you know. - I don't really know sweetie. I'm not really sure how to go about it. I'd like to try. - Can I stay with you forever? - I don't know sweetie, we're working on it. - Ms Lady, can I call you mommy? - I'd love that, I'd be honored. - Goodnight Ms Lady, love you. - Goodnight sweetie, I love you too. - Hey, is everything okay? Honey, talk to me. What's wrong baby? - I need you to pray with me. - Oh baby, it's gonna be all right, I got you. You don't have to cry sweetheart, I got you. Let it go baby, let it go. Father God, we need you right now Lord. - Hurry up guys, we gotta get going. Ms White? What are you doing here? We're due in court in less than two hours. - May I come in? - Sure Is everything okay? - Everything is perfect. Listen, last night this showed up on my desk. I could not give you this news over the phone, I had to come tell you in person. Do you know what this is? This is a letter from Cain Vasquez signing off on his parental rights. - He did it. - Yes, he did. You guys are free to adopt Jacob. - Oh my God. Tommy! Tommy come down here! - What? What's wrong? What's wrong? Ms White, what are you doing here? - He did it, He worked it out. God made it happen. He signed off on his rights. We can adopt Jacob now. - What? Are you serious? - Jake, Jake come here. - Jake hurry up, hurry up. - Come here bud. We can adapt you now. God made everything happen and now you can come live with us forever. - Forever? - Or until you decide to leave us and get married or something. - No way, girls are yucky. - Thank you for everything. - Oh no, don't thank me. We all know who get the thanks for this one. Now listen, we still have to appear today so I'm gonna head on all the while you stay here to get things wrapped up, okay? - Thank you so much. - That chapter, right? - This one. - Right. I don't know how much I understand all this man. - That's why you got to start coming to Bible study Cain. You hear me? You can't understand this overnight. So take your time, bro. Did you start in John like I told you? - Yeah. - Okay, look. Let's go over the first chapter. We're gonna discuss it in the group Thursday night. All right, I got you bro, don't trip. - Vasquez! You got a visitor. - Who is it? - I ain't your secretary, let's go! I ain't got all day, I got child, come on. - Daddy! - How are the Greens treating you, you all right? - Yeah. I live there with mommy and daddy. - Yeah? Good. Then let's go thank them for letting you go see me son. Come on. Boy come here. Thank y'all for bringing my son up here. Thank you. - He talks about you all the time. It's been almost two years. - You talk about me son? Let me finish talking to the greens, all right? Why don't you go play with the toys over there. They'll get you when we're done. Look, I know there's nothing that I'm gonna be able to say that's gonna be able to take any pain away from doing what I did. I'd like to tell you guys that I am sorry. I'm very sorry. I wasn't supposed to hurt anybody. Nobody was supposed to get hurt. All I was trying to do was get some money so I can take care of my son. Nothing like that was supposed to happen, it was an accident. - An accident? It was an accident that you took a loaded gun to go and rob someone? Was it an accident that you didn't feel the need to get up, get a job to earn a decent living like us regular people? You took our son from us! - I know I did that. Every single night, past two years all I've been seeing is Daniel's face. And I expect for that to be my fate for the rest of my life as I rot behind these bars. And I accept that. I pray that by giving y'all the only thing that I have left in this world and the best part of me, my son, that y'all please dig into your heart to forgive me. All I'm asking is forgiveness. Please forgive me. - For long, I hated you. I hated you so much that at one point I couldn't even clear my conscious enough to pray because I felt so dirty from all of the hatred I had in my heart for you. But the day I saw your son in court, something happened to me that I just couldn't explain. I had to deal with my hate for you, in the midst of loving the child that you left behind. And then he asked me if I'll ever be able to forgive his daddy. All I could say was that I'd like to try. And today, as I sit here forgiving myself and washed in the blood of my Lord and savior Jesus Christ, I say I can. - Thank you. - I forgive you. - Thank you. Thank you, thank you. - I forgive you. I forgive you. - Mommy, are you okay? - Yes baby, I'm fine. - Time! - It's time for me to go little man. You think I can get one last hug before I go? - It's okay for a man to cry sometimes. - Daddy was wrong about a lot of things son, it's okay to cry sometimes. Please Jacob, hope you can forgive me for that one day. - I forgive you daddy, I forgive you 'cause I love you. - I love you more son. I gotta go. - Let's go home.
