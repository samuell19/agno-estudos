BEN: Yeah, it is cool, right? THOMAS: Hey, don't go too far. Stay where we can see you. LUCY: Okay. MARGARET: So what do you think this place was used for? Yeah, there's actually a lot of these old ruins around the countryside out here. Could be anything, decommissioned military fort, fur trading company, abandoned miner camp. I really just asked 'cause I knew he wanted to tell us. ELLIE: Oh. (ELLIE AND MARGARET LAUGHING) Where did the kids go? (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) Kids? (LUCY SCREAMS IN DISTANCE) Oh, my God.

BEN: Oh, yeah, thanks, babe. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) (MUSIC FADES) THOMAS: Cabrón, technically, the actual term is, uh, "Macho cabrío," like the male goat. MARGARET: (LAUGHING) Really? (LAUGHS) Yeah. Oh, no. (LAUGHS) THOMAS: That, um, that... (LAUGHS) THOMAS: That doesn't translate literally. The kids are zonked. That hike really took it out of them. ELLIE: They're sleeping like the dead in there. (CHUCKLES) Did you give Spencer that gift you brought him? Oh, no, I was gonna do it after dinner. Hmm. I got him devil sticks. Hmm. I saw them at a shop on our last trip, and I... I had some when I was a kid. I loved them. I thought he'd like them. They're harmless hippie toys. Uh, yeah. (LAUGHS) They kind of are. Harmless as that souvenir slingshot he almost took my eye out with last summer? Mm-hmm. That was maybe not the best gift. Thought that counts. (CHUCKLES) Babe, can you pass me a beer? Yeah. (BEERS CLATTERING) You guys should look into, like, the Badlands. BEN: Dude. How'd you do that? It's easy. You want to try? Yeah, I do. Just, uh, just put the cap against the table. Cap goes there. Firm grip on the neck. BEN: Yeah. Mm-hmm. So, you guys going on any other trips? THOMAS: Hold it really tight. MARGARET: Yeah. Going to Florida. You got to hold it really tight. And then slam on it. BEN: Ow. (GROANS) Damn it. All right. Try again. MARGARET: Next year, maybe you can join us for that. Oh, nice. THOMAS: Try again. The kids could stay with your parents. BEN: I'm gonna get this. You almost got it. BEN: Jesus Christ. It's all right. I can do it. No, I can open my own beer. THOMAS: I'm just... I'm just saying. THOMAS: Try again. BEN: Super tight. Very tight. Ow! But I did it. THOMAS: There you go. You did it. MARGARET: (LAUGHING) Oh, wow. You did it in, uh, in your own way. That's fantastic. (BEN AND MARGARET LAUGHING) Yay? (LAUGHS) BEN: I guess you just got to do it harder. THOMAS: You got to do it harder. There you go, man. Oh, cheers. ELLIE: College. ELLIE: Babe, come on. Do you really have to keep doing that on someone else's furniture? (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) No, yeah, you're right. Uh, that would be... so inappropriate. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (MOUTHING) (SMACKS LIPS) Hey, you want to go, um, toss some horseshoes? Yep. (THOMAS SIGHS) Uh, wh... okay. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (BIRDS CHIRPING) Ellie, would you like to help me make a salad? Sure. (MUSIC FADES) (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING IN BACKGROUND) MARGARET: Okay, I chop, you spill. It's... honestly, it's nothing. He's been acting so weird since we got here. (REFRIGERATOR CLOSES) You, too. So out with it. I really, really shouldn't. "Oh, I really shouldn't." You want to tell me so bad. Look at you. Plus, you know, it might... might make you feel better. (GRUNTS PLAYFULLY) Okay, we're gonna need some drinks. (LAUGHS) (GROANS SOFTLY) Wine. Yeah. THOMAS: Hey, about this morning, can't thank you enough. Ah, dude, it was nothing. Um, so Spencer... he's a little crazy. Oh, he's a lunatic. Absolutely. But you're great with him. Uncle Ben. Eh. So? When are you, uh, when are you guys gonna have your own? Uh, I... you know. I don't know that we're really quite ready for that yet, so... Bro, nobody's ever ready. Like, I think of our parents, and I'm surprised we even made it to adulthood. (CHUCKLES) No, you just got to, you got to jump in. Headfirst. De cabeza. So, Kyle... Mm-hmm. And Katie? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Mm-hmm. How exactly did that work? (CLICKS TONGUE) A lot of alcohol. And the kids were at my parents'. I can't believe Katie. Kyle maybe. Oh, Kyle definitely. But, I mean, you know, they got married after college just like Thomas and me. W... Was it just, like, all of you in one big, like... blob or... (BOTH LAUGHING) I want details. (GULPS) I need another sip. (BOTH LAUGHING) So you and Kyle are on the bed. And where are Thomas and Katie during all this? Uh, on the chair in the corner. Mm-hmm. That little blue one? Okay. And so, she's, like, sitting in Thomas's lap... Mm-hmm. Her back to me clothes still on, mind you. Mm-hmm. And Thomas, you know, starts kissing her neck, and then looks over her shoulder at me, and it just felt like, "This is it. Let's... let's go." (BOTH LAUGHING) BEN: I'm not opposed to it in theory. It's more... in practice I'm not so sure about. THOMAS: Uh-huh. You do know you still have fun when you have kids, right? (SCOFFS) It's just slightly different fun. I like kids. We both like kids. It's just... It's kind of like the high-end Airbnb, you know? It's great for the weekend, just... not so sure it's really our lifestyle. Yeah, you'd be surprised how your lifestyle can change. Is it hard? Sometimes, sure, but it's the best thing, man. Mm. Sometimes it feels like it's the only thing. So things... progress between Kyle and me. Okay, like, you took your clothes off or... Mm-hmm. Ellie. Did you guys actually... Oh, we fucked. (SQUEALS) (LAUGHING) (INHALES) And? (CUP THUDS ON TABLE) And it was great. Until I look over at Thomas and Katie, and they're just watching us, sort of... I don't know, like, half-heartedly canoodling. Canoodling? Mm-hmm. Yeah, it was weird, Margo. But did you finish? So, I told Thomas that I faked it. Off the fucking charts. (LAUGHS) Okay, Kyle. Yes. (BOTH LAUGHING) (INHALES) And so it's been weird ever since. Mm-hmm. I mean, you saw. I just... I don't know. I... I feel like I cheated on him or something. He'll get over it. Mm. Like, he hasn't touched me since. To be fair, you know, it's just been busy with work... Hmm. And the kids and my parents. We haven't really had any time to ourselves. Well, why don't the kids just stay here tonight? Could they? I mean, I don't see why not. Ben actually seems to kind of like having them around. (POURING DRINK) Yes, he does, doesn't he? (GLASSES CLATTER) Don't get any ideas. We're still not having any of our own. (POURING DRINK) Mm. (THUD ON TABLE) You know, we're focusing on our careers right now, and we're not kid people at the end of the day. We like to go out on a whim and travel and, you know, all the stuff you and I used to do before you... Before I had kids. (SIGHS) You know what I mean. Well, maybe it's for the best, you know? (INTRIGUING MUSIC PLAYING) (ELECTRICITY ZAPPING) MARGARET: A double Cancer? ELLIE: Yep, the other one's a Cancer, too. MARGARET: It's just... it's not common when you're, like, a triple of one sign. THOMAS: Is it a bad sign? Yes. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) BEN: Uh, focus. Oh! Hey. All right. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Careful, dude. You're gonna whack yourself in the head, okay? Look, took me a while to figure it out, but you'll get the hang of it. (CHUCKLES) Just practice. You're doing great. Um, just... (CLEARS THROAT) (MUSIC FADES) BEN: Ah, you... I know. It's just frustrating. Great. No. Ooh, watch your face. Ooh, sh... (CLICKS TONGUE) BEN: All right, go get them. I was thinking maybe the kids could stay with us tonight. Say what? (GULPS, CLICKS TONGUE) That's a great idea. Yeah. Sure. That should be fun. Won't that be fun, guys? A little sleepover? You guys can stay... (SPEAKING SPANISH) Okay? Can I get some verbal confirmation? (SPEAKS SPANISH) No, that's all right. You don't have to turn around. Uh, yeah, I think we've already been replaced. ELLIE: Mm-hmm. BEN: That's it. Okay. Okay, okay. Okay. Hand them over. Hold my beer. Devil sticks. See? Just finesse, finesse. You just got to feel them sticks. Give it a flippity flip. Okay? You want to see the helicopter? (MAKING WHOOSHING SOUNDS) How about them hot moves? Yeah? Yeah? See how easy? Remember the balance? (SLURPS, GULPS) BEN: Just keep practicing, and you will get the hang of it. Promise. (SIGHS) Well, I'm about ready to go. Right now? Mm-hmm. THOMAS: Okay? Yeah? Yeah. ELLIE: All right, kids, we're gonna go, so be good. BEN: So, this is the simple stuff. It's for babies, okay? (MOUTHING) BEN: Once you get good, you start doing the flips, okay? BEN: Oh! MARGARET: Ooh. LUCY: Nice. Demon Sword. BEN: Wait, I have a Demon Sword. MARGARET: Uh, wait, so can I play now... (GLASS THUD ON TABLE) that he's put his card down or do we have to wait... You can't do that. MARGARET: You had two Demon Swords? BEN: I'm gonna referee. You can't do that. There's no order. This isn't Uno. LUCY: Guys, it's... it's not that complicated. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Unless you get the Rabid Queen. That changes everything. Ooh, what happens if you get the Rabid Queen? Yeah, what happens? You don't want to know. We just asked. Here. Moving on. I'm playing this one. Normally, you put the thing there. MARGARET: Here? LUCY: No. Let me... (SIGHS) Quiero volver. (LUCY AND MARGARET CHATTERING) What's up? Quiero volver. I don't know. What's that mean? He wants to go back. (THUD ON TABLE) Back where? LUCY: The bright place. The place that shines. In the woods. Oh, that old fort? Nah, dude, I don't think we're gonna go back there. Ah, we got lots of fun things we can do here, like teach you some new tricks with your sticks. See if you can pick those up. (LUCY AND MARGARET CHATTERING) I got a lot of cool stuff... (HISSES) (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (CHATTERING STOPS) Sounds great, Ben. MARGARET: I'm gonna pull. I feel like... Okay. MARGARET: Oh, shit! Good. I got the Serpentine Lord. BEN: Mm. MARGARET: That's bad, right? You swore. Um... if I give you 20 bucks, will you not tell your mom? You're bribing children now? (BOTH LAUGHING) Guys, let's just play this game. Yeah, sorry. I win. MARGARET: We'll be right out here if you need anything, okay? Do you want the door open or closed? LUCY AND SPENCER: Closed. Okay. Good night. (LIGHT SWITCH CLICKS) They're out like a light. That wasn't so bad. (BEN SCOFFS) Kids are fine. It's what it does to the parents that I don't like. You talking about Thomas? No, I'm talking about both of them. They were at each other's throats all day. Well, that is not the kids' fault. Wait, wait, wait. What do you know? What aren't you telling me? Why don't we enjoy the night air? Okay. (DOOR OPENING) (SIGHS) BEN: Wow. Just wow. (LAUGHING) I know. Kyle I can see, but... Right? (BEN CHUCKLES SOFTLY) (LAUGHING) Makes me wonder about all those date nights my parents had when I was a kid. (GROANS) (CHUCKLES) (GENTLE MUSIC PLAYING) What? Do you want kids? (LAUGHS SOFTLY) What? (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) I... I mean... well, you kind of decided this for us. See, that. That there. I made the decision, not us. You know, I see how great you are with Lucy and Spencer, and I just... I wonder if it's something I'm keeping you from. You know? Like, I just... I want to make sure that we're still on the same page. Look, we don't have to decide tonight, all right? We've got time. I mean, you got time. I have an expiration date. Fair enough. Okay. (SIGHS) Okay. You want to talk about it? Let's talk about it. I mean, yes. I don't... I don't know. I... I just don't want to feel like I'm the only person that has to figure it out. What do you mean by that? Never mind. Okay. (SIGHS) Oh, I just feel so real right now. What do you mean? Like... connected. That's the word. I feel connected. Connected to what? This. This... fire. These trees, these bugs. (CRICKETS CHIRPING) Um, I want to feel this way all the time. I just feel like I'm a part of everything, like everything is connected and it's bigger than me, you know? And you think about the city and how disjointed it is, and... I don't know. When I think about it sometimes, it just makes me... (MAKES GAGGING NOISE) (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Love... you are very high. (LAUGHS) No. Oh, no, I... I promise. You got to trust me on this one. I'm a little high. (LAUGHING) You're high as hell. Come here. (LAUGHS) Okay. (GRUNTS) Let's feel connected. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) I'll take that. I'm a one-hit wonder. You took like six hits.

(PILLS RATTLE) (BEN EXHALES) (PLATES CLATTER) (PHONE CHIMES) (CUTLERY CLATTERS) (PHONE CHIMES) Yes. Get it, girl. (PHONE CHIMES) MARGARET: The kids awake? No, they're, uh, still sleeping, I think. Lucky they sleep so late. (CHUCKLES) Rise and shine, sleepyheads. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING) Lucy? Spencer? I think I can convince Ben to make us some pancakes. Luce? Spencer? I'm gonna open the door, okay? (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) They're not in there. Did you check the bathroom? Mm-hmm. Yeah. Uh, maybe they're just playing outside or something. (GROANS SOFTLY) I don't see them out there. Really? Maybe they're, um... Go check and see if they're playing over by the pond. (SIGHS) (DOOR OPENING) (POURING) (THUD ON TABLE) (BEATING EGGS) (DOOR CLOSING) BEN: You don't see them? Huh. (DOOR OPENING) (DOOR CLOSING) Okay, I'm freaking out. No, no. You know what? Remember they were playing hide-and-seek yesterday? Probably just hiding and want us to... Right, well... Lucy, we're not playing right now! find them. Spencer? Hey, guys? Hey. Breakfast. (SIGHS) Lucy? They're not in any of the closets. Okay, wait. Look, hey, they probably just went back over to Thomas and Ellie's place. She just texted me. There's no way they're over there. The kids' shoes are gone. What? They took their shoes. No, they wouldn't have. They wouldn't have what, Ben? Ben, where you gonna go? They wouldn't have what? I'm just gonna check the path. They can't have gone far. Okay, well, I'll go with you. No, no, no, stay at the house in case they come back. (DOOR CLOSING) Were they even in the cabin when we came back in last night? They didn't sneak out, all right? The sun came up, they thought they'd go for a walk. They probably just went back down this path. They can't have gone far. They're fine. Everything's gonna be fine. (MUSIC FADES) We're gonna find them. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (PANTS) Lucy. BEN: (IN DISTANCE) Lucy! Spencer! (GROANS SOFTLY, PANTS) (GRUNTS) Guys? Jesus Christ, there you are. What are you guys doing in here? Hey! You know you can't be here without an adult. Guys. Es brilliante. Okay, I need you to come down here right now. No, I'm... I'm serious. Right now. No, no, no. Stop! No! (MUSIC INTENSIFIES) (WHISPERS) Oh, God. (STIFLED RETCHING) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING) (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) (PANTS) (CELL PHONE CONTINUES VIBRATING) Why aren't you answering your phone? (SIGHS) Fuck. (CELL PHONE VIBRATING) Margaret. MARGARET: Where are you? Have you found them? Please tell me you found them. (SNIFFLES) I went up to the lookout, and... Ben? I followed the flowers. No, Ben, you're breaking up. I followed... I followed the flowers. Ben? I'm alm... I'm almost home. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) Hey. Hey. MARGARET: (SIGHS) Thank God. (KIDS SHOUTING PLAYFULLY) Thank God. No, Ben, they're here. They're here. I was so sure I was gonna see their little bodies floating in the lake. Could you even imagine? (SIGHS) I... I see you. (MUSIC FADES) No, I can't. I can't imagine. (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC FADES) MARGARET: You know how much he loves to hike... (KIDS LAUGHING) so he had to fit one in. ELLIE: Damn, Ben, you look like hell. I was just telling Ellie how quickly the kids petered out this morning. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING) Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. And how you took them out for a hike, brought them back and then went out on your own. BEN: Right. (KIDS CHATTERING PLAYFULLY) (DOOR SLAMS LOUDLY) You good, man? Uh, yeah. Th... They're... they're okay? Yeah, except they're bouncing off the freaking walls. What'd you guys give them for breakfast, pure sugar? (KIDS SCREAMING PLAYFULLY) LUCY: Wait for me. ELLIE: No... (THOMAS SPEAKING SPANISH) I'm busy. I'm... Stop. No. Okay. (LAUGHS) I'm coming to get you! MARGARET: Well, it looks like you two enjoyed your night off. (LUCY SCREAMS PLAYFULLY) (THOMAS AND ELLIE TALKING QUIETLY, LAUGHING) MARGARET: Okay. We're still standing here. Mom, why is Ben staring at me? (MUSIC FADES) I saw them. (GROANS SOFTLY) I know I saw them. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (MARGARET LAUGHING) BEN: Hey, guys. Did, uh... you sleep all right last night? Of course we did, silly. Dead bugs. Those aren't dead. (LUCY CHUCKLES) Like I said. Uh... L... let me ask you something. Did you two go for a little walk this morning? (HUSHED CHITTERING) What was that all about? It's our secret language. You want to know what he said to me? Stop messing around. I need to know where you went this morning. Hold this under your chin. If your chin glows yellow... Okay, did you go back to the fort, all right? If you did, it's okay. I just need to know. Do the thing first, then I'll tell you. Promise. Está brillando. Means you have a secret, too. Okay, well? LUCY: Yes, we went there. But you won't tell on us, will you? Wait, what did you do there? Careful, Ben. Or we'll run off and join the circus. (CHUCKLES) Hey. Little man. Careful with those, all right? They're heavy. If you hit yourself in the head, it'll hurt. Hey, just don't go so high. Stop. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (LUCY SPEAKS SPANISH) Is it glowing? (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (LAUGHS) (THOMAS AND ELLIE CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY) I'm starving. THOMAS: Mm-hmm. ELLIE: Yeah, you think that I'd leave this? THOMAS: No. ELLIE: That's not how it works. But this is why, like, I live in a house. (THOMAS SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY) Oh. I'm full. (THOMAS AND ELLIE CONTINUE INDISTINCTLY) (THOMAS AND ELLIE LAUGHING) (MUSIC FADES) You all right? Ben? Ben. Um... what... what were they doing? The kids when you found them. Oh, I didn't. Ellie said that they came into the cabin right before they saw us. She thought we sent them over to get them up in the morning. They must have been in the backwoods behind the cabin or something and we just missed them. They... they went... they went back there. Where? T... To that old fort, the pit. "The place that shines." They told me that. That's a really strenuous hike for two little kids to make. They're probably just putting you on. Wait, you haven't noticed? What? The way they look at you now? The... the... the nosebleeds? And... and Spencer with the sticks. He couldn't fucking keep those things in the air for two seconds yesterday, and now he's a goddamn majorette. That's not possible. I was really scared this morning, too, but they're here now and they're safe and it's fine. No. I... I need you to just listen to me 'cause what I'm gonna tell you is gonna sound impossible. Just please hear me. I saw them jump into that pit. (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING) I saw them just tip right into it like they were in some sort of a trance. (BREATHES DEEPLY) I don't think that's them out there anymore. Margo. What? How you been feeling lately? Are you serious right now? I'm just asking. Look, you've seen that. That is not this. This is not that. I don't know what this is. Yeah, but you don't believe me. I think you were in an agitated state, and you maybe saw something that you can't quite explain or process in some rational way just yet. "Rationally." Yeah, no. Uh, way to parse words, Margo. Look, we're both really... a little overtired right now. You know, why don't you lie down? Have a nap. (SIGHS) Yeah. No, you're right. I should probably just get some rest. Okay. (SIGHS) (DOOR CLOSES) (SIGHS) (MUSIC FADES) Jesus Christ. You shouldn't swear. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) What are you doing in here? Just wanted to see what you were up to. Okay, well, I'm not in the mood, so just get out. But we want to play a game with you. What game? (SHARP THUD) (GASPS) (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) (MUSIC FADES) MARGARET: Did you ever play, like, powder-puff? Why'd they call it "Powder-puff?" I don't know. 'Cause they have to call it, like, a little bitchy name 'cause you're a girl. (ELLIE LAUGHING) (LAUGHS) I don't know. That's what I was thinking. Like, why isn't it just "Girls football?" It's called "girlie girl girl football." (LAUGHING) "Do you play football or do you play powder-puff?" (MARGARET AND ELLIE LAUGHING) I don't even remember what was on the back of my jersey, like... (ELLIE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY) MARGARET: Hey. I thought you were gonna lie down. Uh, I didn't want to miss all the fun. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (SMACKS LIPS) So, I think that would be good. Hey. They ever, uh... (BOX CLOSING) They ever scare you? Those two? Yeah. Absolutely. All the time. No, not them. Kids. Your... your kids. (BEER UNCAPS) What, you mean like... I don't know, just, like... Oh, geez! THOMAS: (LAUGHING) Okay. (CHUCKLES) Good timing, Spence. I'm hungry. THOMAS: All right, just... Just have some chips, but don't overdo it. Dinner's almost ready. LUCY: Hey, Ben! (MARGARET AND ELLIE LAUGHING) Just like a super, like, tiny... Look at me. Whoa, hey! Hey! What? Um... Do you want a beer? Uh, no, we're drinking wine. Cool. You want some? They're my favorite. Jesus Christ. No. But aren't you hungry, Ben? Hey. Not everybody wants to spoil their dinner, bud. You feeling all right? Yeah, no. I'm... (MUSIC FADES) just tired. Excuse me, young lady. What do you think you're doing? Oh, my God. What... Lucy. That was inappropriate. And amazing. (LAUGHS) Thank you. That's a really good pour. Too good. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (SPENCER TAPPING) For you, Daddy. No, no, no. Oh, my God. What the hell, dude? Whoa. THOMAS: The hell's your problem? Uh, hey, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Just show, um, show them. Show them! Hey, don't yell at my son. Ben, what are you doing? Give me the bottle. Give me the goddamn... Hey, Ben! Hey! Hands off him! BEN: Give me the goddamn bottle. Ow! All right, hey, look. MARGARET: Hey, Ben! What? You're on mood stabilizers. So what? (PILLS RATTLE) Wait, th... these... these were empty. He... You showed me... She was gonna put the, um... them into... SPENCER: (CRYING) My hand. He hurt my hand. Jesus Christ, Ben. What's wrong with you? Are you okay? I thought they were candy. No, they're fucking with me. Ben, he's nine. No. Wh... Whatever he is, he's fucking with me. He showed me this bottle. It was empty, all right? And she was gonna put them in... into your drink, and somehow he got the pills... you got the pills back in here. Somehow he put them back in here to make me look like... To what? To make me overdose? Is that what you're saying, that my kids were gonna make me overdose? I... I don't, I don't, I don't... Just breathe. Okay? Take a breath. They went out on their own this morning. MARGARET: Ben. What? BEN: Yeah, they... they went out. What are you talking about? BEN: No, no, they... they snuck out, and... and I went after them to the... to the ruins. And you know what I saw? No. Yes. I saw them jump into the pit. And then I saw your broken little bodies at the bottom of that fucking pit! ELLIE: Ben, shut the fuck up! That's what... Shut up. Shut up. (QUIETLY) Okay. Uh... Kids, go... go play. But I want to listen. THOMAS: Lucy. (SPEAKING SPANISH STERNLY) Vamos. You let them go out alone? No. We didn't let them go out. They just went. They just... What do you mean they just went? Well, when we woke up, they were gone. Hold... hold on a s... I'm... I'm missing something. When I texted you this morning, why didn't you mention that? Well, I didn't know then, and we just didn't tell you afterward. We just didn't want to worry you if there was nothing to worry about. Margaret, what the fuck? I'm still trying to understand how you let them out of your sight like that. They were sleeping. What, are we supposed to tie them in a tree to protect them from bears? No, Ben, we wanted you to be responsible adults, but clearly we made a bad judgment call on you and your goddamn mental health. Okay, Thomas, that's enough. Those are our children, Margaret. Okay, maybe you don't know what that feels like, but it would be really fucking nice if you'd try. Okay, so because I haven't experienced the miracle of childbirth, I don't know what it takes to babysit your kids? You don't understand the responsibility. What? You say that you guys aren't kid people because your jet-setting life is so full, you're so focused on your career. Give me a fucking break, okay? You're not fooling anyone. Are you serious? Like you two are the paragons of responsibility? Okay, you need to stop right now. Oh, oh, Mr. Moral Authority speaks. I'm not fucking around, Ben. BEN: Oh, great. I'm glad you're serious. Then we can all talk about the fact that we're only in this situation because the two of you pawned your creepy-ass kids off on the two of us... What? To save your shitty-ass marriage. MARGARET: Okay, Ben. Oh, wait, right. You guys live, like, a mile away from your parents, right? That's super convenient. So then you can just pawn your creepy kids off on them, too, whenever you guys want to go have a foursome. (MUSIC FADES) Ben. Yeah, I'm sorry. I know. It was more of a... two-and-a-half-some, right? MARGARET: Ben! (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) Are you fucking kidding me? ELLIE: No. (SIGHS) I... THOMAS: You... ELLIE: Babe, I'm sorry. This is fucked. I'm sorry. You're all fucked. THOMAS: You're all fucked! Mm. Ellie, I'm sorry. (CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Well, I see everything's all out on the table. What? Come on, Ben. You think we don't tell each other everything? About your little manic episodes? Ellie, shut up. How you went off the deep end and lost another job? MARGARET: Ellie. ELLIE: You know, maybe it's not that Margaret doesn't want to have kids. (MUSIC FADES) Maybe she just doesn't want to have them with you. (GROANS SOFTLY) Fucking nice. MARGARET: Ben. (BEN SIGHS) (HINGES CREAKING) (SIGHS) (OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING) LUCY: What's wrong? (GASPS) Stop doing that. I didn't mean to scare you. SPENCER: Fuck. Shit, fuck, shit, fuck. S... Stop. Okay? Get out of here. Guys, look. Hey, I'm... I'm done. All right, go play with your parents. I don't care anymore. But don't you want to know what happened this morning? I'll tell you. If you can keep it a secret. Yeah. No, no, no, I won't tell anyone. What happened? SPENCER: Insectos muertos. BEN: What did he just say? Dead bugs. BEN: Hey, Lucy, I was responsible for the two of you, so I need to know that you're both okay. I need to know that I'm okay. Do you understand that? Of course I do. And I promise... we're better than ever. (GROANS) Jesus Christ. (MOCKINGLY) "Jesus Christ." All right, give me the shovel. Make me. Make you? Just give it to me. BEN: (GRUNTING) Come on, give it to me. (LAUGHS) Spencer! (CHOKES) (LUCY LAUGHING) Spencer? (CONTINUES LAUGHING) Hey. Wh... Spence, hey, hey. All right, just cough. Try and cough it up. (CHOKING) (LUCY CONTINUES LAUGHING) Spence. Spencer. Spence, hey, hey, hey. Come on. Breathe. You got to breathe, buddy. Come on. Come on. (SLAPPING LIGHTLY) (GRUNTS) Come on! Come on! (BEN SLAPPING) Come on, Spencer. Spencer, come on. Just breathe. Breathe. Please. Come on. Wake up. Come on, don't... don't do this. Don't do this. You're messing with me. Come on. Come on! Wake up. Ben? Oh, my God. BEN: He's not breathing. I... I can't find a pulse. Margo, I can't find a pulse! Ellie! Ellie! Move, move, move. (STAMMERS) What do we do? What do we do? I don't know. (GRUNTING) BEN: I don't know. He's not... he's not, um... Ellie! I don't know what we're supposed to do. ELLIE: (STAMMERING) What... what? BEN: He's... What? No, no, no, no! No, Spencer. (PANTS) BEN: Is he going to be okay? ELLIE: (GRUNTS) Come on. No, Spencer. Come on. Come on, Spencer. MARGARET: Thomas! (CRYING) Come on, Spencer. MARGARET: Thomas! What happened? ELLIE: Come on. No. No. Come on. Daddy. Oh, no. Oh, my God. No. No. No. No. THOMAS: Lucy, look at me. (ELLIE CRYING) THOMAS: It's gonna be fine. It's okay. (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) (SOBBING) (ELLIE SOBBING LOUDLY) No. No. (ELLIE CONTINUES SOBBING) What happened? What did you do? (DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING) No, no, no. I... I didn't, I didn't do anything. This wasn't me. This... this isn't... this isn't my fault. What are you talking about? BEN: They did this. This is... this is their fault! This is your fault! ELLIE: Get out! BEN: No, I... I... ELLIE: Get out! Shut up and get the fuck out of here! I told you, ever since they went out... I just need you to listen. No, get the fuck out! Okay, okay. Get the fuck out of here! Get out! Just listen to me for one second. ELLIE: Get the fuck out! Get the fuck out! (SOBBING) (MUSIC FADES) (SOBBING LOUDLY) Oh, my God, no! (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING) MARGARET: I need to report a... Oh, God. I need to report... I... I need to report a death. Hello? This is Thomas Huerta. (INHALES) Ben Winslow has just murdered my son. End of Churchill Road. The Far Syde Cabins. A few hours? Yeah, we can wait. We'll be here.

Hey. No, no. It's not me. Hey. Hey. Hey. You got to believe me. I don't know what to say to you. This all started when we... when we went to the ruins. Th... Think about it. The kids have been obsessed with going back there. "The place that shines." They jumped in, and something down there took their place. Their bodies must still be there. MARGARET: Oh, Ben. No, no, I'm not crazy. I'm not. You know, if you come with me, you'll see. Come on, come on. Ben, let go of me. No, you just need to see. Let go of my arm. No, come on. Ben! You're just making things worse. What will this prove? I need you to believe me. I need you to be on my side. Fine. Fine, let's go. And when there's nothing there, what then? What do we do then? (MUSIC FADES) (MYSTERIOUS MUSIC PLAYING) (CRICKETS CHIRPING) (GRUNTS) (GRUNTING) BEN: They were there. Margaret, they were just right there. Margaret, please. Do not look at me like that. There's nothing there, Ben. No, I know what I saw. They were right there, okay? (STAMMERS) Just right... just right fucking there! All right, all right, okay. I'll j... I'll... I can climb down and I... (SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING) What the fuck? Okay. Okay, okay. I bet an animal dragged them away or something. Some... Something happened! Some... Th... There's something I just don't understand yet... Ben. Ben. But I will. Okay, no, no, no! I'm gonna understand, and then you'll see it. Ben! Just stop! Even with all of the evidence just staring right at you, you can't admit, you can't even acknowledge just for one moment that you might be wrong! Everything that's happening... it's just in your head! I know what I saw. You need to listen to me. Ben, Spencer is dead. He is dead. And it's not because of some old building or a hole in the ground. It's because your actions, they have consequences. Your ac... You. You did this. Just you. That's how it is? Yeah, that's how it is. (SCOFFS) Ben. We have to go back and... sort it out. But... when we're there... we can keep talking. Ben, for me, please. Let's just go back together.

Honey... I want to show you what's in the woods. Lucy. I want to show you what's in the woods. Please? (SNIFFLING) (CRYING) Oh, honey. THOMAS: Are you okay for a minute? I'll...

I didn't understand why the kids were so drawn to it before, but now... now I do. I know why they followed it down. Hey, I...
