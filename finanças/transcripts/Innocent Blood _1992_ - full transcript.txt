I'd become very selective, and it was getting harder for me to find food, even living in the city. My choosiness about food cost me my lover, and without him, there is no sex. For six nights, I have found nothing to eat. But then came good news. I was sad. I was starved. It was time to treat myself, and I thought, "what about Italian?" Don't worry about the car. Leave the keys in case we have to move it. Hey, Lenny. How you doing, huh? All right. What took you? I had to dress right. I had to shave. He wants you in on this. Hey, ton, what's this all about, huh? Watch this. Aah! Aah! I love that. Place is bugged. We do business downstairs. Come on. See? We come so far down, we're in China. Sal, how you doing? I was honored by your call... A little surprised. I didn't think... have a seat. So, uh, Sal, what's happening here, huh? What's this? It's a... It's a toaster. It's a toaster oven. Whoa, hey. It's a nice one. A lot of buttons. Hit this button... Pops open. You could put anything in here... slice of pizza, pastry. You Pop it in. Comes out, the crust is crisp. Microwave don't do that. You ever tried cooking calzone in a microwave? It comes out like a limp dick. Yeah. Korean. They're getting a big chunk of the electronics action. Do you know why? Because they fucking steal. Any fucking idea that ain't nailed down. You think some korean asshole came up with the toaster oven? Well, here they are, knocking them out. Where'd it come from? What, Sal? The toaster? Honestly, I don't know. You was with Leguto. When Leguto fell off the face of the earth, you became mine. Then you got this idea because I just took over, maybe I'm confused, maybe I'm letting things slip through the cracks. No, Sal, I would never think... where did it come from? Sal, tell me what the answer is. What should I say? It came from a warehouse. It came off a truck from the airport! A truck you hit Tuesday! Where's my end, Gilly? I had to take inventory, make sure you got a complete cross section of the merchandise. I thought this was just a sit-down. Yeah, but somebody ain't getting up. I got a message for your warehouse guys. Please, god. Sallie, no. The message is... Don't fuck with me! Sal! We got eyes on us! Maybe somebody saw this guy come in here. What are you saying? You telling me something? Get rid of him discreet. You want discreet? You fucking shoot him. Ray! Do it! Please, Sal, no. You don't understand. It's a terrible mistake. I want to live. I'll do anything for you. Please! Please help me! Please, Sal. You don't understand. Gilly, that's fucking disgusting. No, please! Don't do it to me! You don't understand! Don't do it to me. Don't! You don't understand! Fucking die. Next time I tell you to pull the trigger, you fucking pull the trigger! Sal, come on, relax. Joe's one of us. Yeah. Ha ha! This shit's starting to get to me. Ha ha ha! Yeah. He does what he's got to do. He loves it. He's fucking sick. You can't talk like that. This is war. We're soldiers. We kill to protect what's ours. Here. Take this. It's clean. I'm good at stealing. I'm not a shooter. If you're not a shooter, you're shot. Bang! You just can't sit around and watch anymore. Sal will tell you to whack somebody, and you got no choice. Come on. Fucking cops! Hey! Jesus, Joey! Aah! Ow! Hey, back off! You think we're fucking entertainment? Fucking asshole! Oh, shit. You think we're fucking MTV? Get out of here! Back off! Yay! Yay! Come on! What's wrong with him? Whoa! Fuck, Joey! You don't do that! What the fuck am I supposed to do? You don't do those things! Take it easy, man! Go home and get your head straight. Go ahead. I'm sorry, Tony. Oh! Jeez, I'm sorry. I ruined you. Let me help you. Give me your bag. Put your hand up here. I'm really, uh... I'm sorry about that. I didn't see you there. He looked promising. Can I give you a ride somewhere? Maybe I could buy you a drink... coffee, hot tea. You could do with some warming up. He felt promising. But his eyes were... Sad, so very sad. My first rule... never play with the food. Are you sure? Do not touch the car. Do not touch the fucking car! This guy was perfect. Gee, I'm sorry. Don't hurt me, O.K.? I... I just got scared. I could have got run over. Thank god you've got good reflexes. You can really move for someone so... Big. Look, we're getting soaked. I'll give you a lift. Where you going? Gee, Tony, this is just so great of you. I know it's a little out of your way. Across the fucking river. All Sinatra? Hey, don't start on Sinatra. There's this park... got a great view of the city. You want to see a great view, Tony? Very nice. Hey. Hey, yourself. I can tell you're excited. Yes. Not shy, are you? Come on, baby. Let's get in the back. Give Tony a little room to get into some motion. Come on. Aah! What are you, some kind of a freak? Grrr! Aah! Aah! Grrr! My second rule... always finish the food. That means eliminating the feed marks and a central nervous system disconnect. Oh, that's O.K. This one has everyone a little spooked. Standard shotgun hit, right? Nah. This guy's lost a lot of blood. Yeah, well, he had his head blown off. This guy's really lost a lot of blood. It's not here. Decent amount of splatter, but hardly what you'd expect. Blood should have settled in his ankles, turning them purple. I'd say this guy's about five quarts low. What in hell are you doing out here? I was with Tony last night. I heard he got hit. Any of these cops could be in the mob's pocket. The damn press is here! He was a friend. A friend? He stood up for me. Without Tony, I'd be in a lot of trouble. You're not in trouble, Gennaro. You're gone. It's over. What? I'm putting you into protection. Morales! You're kidding me. Mm-mm. You've been under too long. Look, Sinclair... no. No. Save it, Gennaro, because I'm not listening to you this time. You are a danger to this investigation and to yourself. I'm in total control. Oh? Coming here? That cowboy stunt last night with the Van? This asshole was too damn close. That's bullshit! I was doing my job! Just get him out of here! You cannot pull me out now. It's absolutely the wrong fucking time. Macelli will ask me to make a hit. I'm going to tape it and nail the fucker. I've lived with them for three years... eating, drinking, stealing. You've been sitting behind a desk. You come here and say, "that's it. It's over." It's all I fucking got. All right. We got your testimony, your tapes. You'll get us Macelli, huh? Come on. Miss Sinclair! Hi, guys. This was the first time my food made the front page. Hey. Thank you. That fucking pig. I knew he wasn't right. Sallie, our problem is... the problem is, find Joey Gennaro. Put two behind his fucking ear. Don't say that in front of your attorney. Sinclair will come down on you with the Rico act and freeze your assets. You're afraid you won't get paid? That's the least of my worries. I'm saying make arrangements. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. What if I go right here? Make arrangements, that's what I'm saying! Make arrangements! You putz. Who's this? Little girl got lost. I figured I'd take her home. I got my ass on the grill, and you can't get your mind off pussy. Jacko, ain't that the prick from the papers? Yeah. Punch his fucking lights out. Ha ha ha! You dress like a pimp and talk like a goon. What makes you news? Excuse me? She's from out of town. Must be from Mars to talk like that. Nobody calls me pimp. Nobody calls me goon. Since I'm 16, what people call me is Sallie the shark, and I pick my teeth with girls like you. Sal. You're the dumbest bitch I ever met, but you got balls. Want a ride? You got one. I should have walked away, but he annoyed me. Thanks, carmine. You're wonderful. Maybe I got to apologize. My world's going to shit at the speed of light. Puts me in a mood. Call me Sal. What do I call you? Marie. Oui, Marie... Let's make up over a little late supper. I'd love a little late supper, but it looks like we're not exactly alone. Tell me about it. My guys, the feds, reporters. Probably some bastards want to put lead in my head. Lenny, lose them. The hideaway. Losing them, Sal. OK, stay on your toes. Take me about an hour. Right, Sal. Where's the bag? Right here. Oh. Hey, come on. All right. Come on. What do you think? It's you. I could do without the bars on the windows, but what are you going to do? The city... it's a fucking zoo, right? I was going to eat this with a colleague from squirrel hill. Boy, is he going to be pissed. Prepare yourself for a little bit of heaven. None for me, thanks. Hey, Mangia, Mangia. You're a good-looking broad, but a little meat on the bones never goes out of style. Mussels and garlic from Munafo's, for Christ's sake. Come on. I... I do not eat fish. You're a vegetarian? Ha ha! Well, this is mussels. They're vegetables... More or less. Ha ha ha! Uh! I've got to... Hey, the bathroom is over there. This was a mistake. Uh! Oh... Eh... Baby... Anything I can do? Come on, baby. Relax, hmm? You want to lay down? Uh... Garlic... Garlic is hard for me. You ain't Italian, that's for sure. Heh heh! This light... My eyes are sensitive. Sensitive. Is everything on you sensitive? Hey! Don't play Mary virgin with me. I look in your eyes. You've been down some dark alleys. Yeah. Heh heh. Come on, bitch! Take a ride, huh? Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Mmm. Oh, yeah, baby. Oh, yeah, come on. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Give it. Oh, yeah, give it. Grrr! Aah! Grrr! Ah! Sal! Oh, god! I know I'm a freak to you guys... half a crook, half a cop. My wife thought that, too. She left you, didn't she? You'd leave me, too, if you could. Shh! Aah! Shh! Uh! Ah! Pizza man. Yeah. ...myself. I stand at attention! Name, Dan Quayle. Rank... o.K. Thanks. Look, when things cool down, you can start all over. This shit won't cool down. These guys will want my head forever. Who died? Macelli. He took a hit on the north side. Shit. You made him look so bad, his people took him out. It's justice. No, this is impossible. You still got plenty of cases against his crew. Big cases. Shit! Excuse me. I had you nailed, you son of a bitch. Where's the blood? Pardon? The carotid artery was cut, right? There should be blood from wall to wall. Well, what do you think? My thinking is the less I say, the safer my pension. You found something under his nails, right? Hair? Flesh? Traces of makeup? Perp was a female. Hmm. What? His temperature should be dropping. Yeah? It's going up. Poor Sallie. He wasn't such a bad guy. Who was she, Lenny? Who was she? Your mother! Come on. Let's go. Come on! You're dead. You're already dead! You're a fucking whore! Break it up! Jesus! Sorry you lost a client, Bergman. There's plenty more scum. Compared to you, my clients are paragons of honor! Get off me. Get off of me! Tape it over to the west wall. Watch your back! Watch your back, please. Coming through here. Let us through. Shit! Grrr! Aah! Uh! Grrr! Grrr! Grrr! Hey! That's my dog. Oh. Thanks. Aah! Aah! Ah! Ah! You are under arrest. Stay away from me or I'll kill you! God... Just when I thought I understood some shit. This him? The big guy himself? Yup. He don't look so big now, though. Just another hefty bag enchilada, like the rest. O.K. You can take him up. See ya. Pardon you. No, that wasn't me. It was... it was him. It's just gas, fella. Come on. 1... 2... 3. Some nights there's so much belching in here, it's like being in a ball park. I'll see you later. Uh! What the hell hospital is this? This isn't a hospital. Ugh! Yeeaah! Yaah! Grrr! Yaaah! Ugh! Well, stop him! You stop him. Uh! Uh! Oh! I want a line out. I want my lawyer! Hey, look. Why don't you just lie down... yaah! Come on, folks. Step aside, please. Step aside. Coming through. All the way back. Right there. That's good. Ladies and gentlemen... You cannot rush an autopsy. As soon as we know, you'll know. Macelli? Macelli's alive! Oh. Damn it! Oh! Aah! Aah! That's my car. Petrelli with you? Will you get this car out of the way? Fuck! Move it! What's the rush? Macelli's car smashed into a gas station in Shadyside. What was the meat wagon doing up there? Macelli was driving. Oh! Uh! Aah! Ugh! Stop! I said... Ooh! Stop the fucking car! Aah! Ah! How the hell do I get to Shadyside? Manny... Turn off the fucking lights! ...find something that appeals, god damn it. Son of a bitch! I'm fucking dying here. Sallie, maybe you ought to sit down. No, no. I'm not sitting down. I ain't lying down. Last time I laid down, a fucker tells me I'm dead! Some prick stuck a thermometer in my kidney. It must have healed. It's OK, Sal. It's OK. Let me get you that drink. Hey... you smell. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You smell good. Sallie! We got to talk. Everybody thinks you're dead... the cops, the press. That's right. It's a fucking plot. Yeah! Somebody tried to whack me... the gambinos, the feds. They laid me out in the morgue. They tried to saw me in half. You got to call a press conference! You got to sue those cocksuckers. Huh... Sallie? I was warming this for you. Sallie! Sallie, what the hell happened? Crazy bitch. She fucking bit me. We got to get you a doctor. Mmm! No, I'm fine. I just got this appetite. Mmm. I'll call a couple of the boys. Grrr! Grrr! You are in deep shit, lady, really deep shit. You're the one that blew Tony Silva's head off and took Macelli out. I'd appreciate it if you would drive. Who do you work for? Self-employed. You do this for fun? For sport? You do this for the blood? You're a cop. Where's your cop radio? This isn't my cop car. I wish you hadn't jumped on it. Sorry. Macelli's not dead, is he? Why are you after him? To kill him? Why didn't you make sure he was dead the first time you killed him? I fucked up, O.K.? Don't tell me it never happened to you. What in hell are you? I'll find out where Macelli is. Jesus, Joe! Macelli's here? He's alive? Should I cuff him? Cuff her, for Christ's sakes, but be careful. She's fast, and she's strong. She's the one who got Macelli. She's a goddamn freak. She chomped Macelli in the neck and drained his blood. She blew Tony's head off to make sure he stayed dead. Look, guys, I'm aware of how this sounds. Flinton, be careful. Get out! Where'd you find her? At the church outside Macelli's. She can climb... Joe, shut up and listen to yourself. You got such a hard-on for Macelli, you figure whoever iced him had to be some blood- sucking superbitch. I know this whole thing is crazy. How did Macelli drive the car? As far as I'm concerned, the medical examiner's a moron, and Macelli is one dead son of a bitch. What happened to your car? She, uh... She jumped on it. Ha ha! God. Put him in the car, Dave. Oh, man. You'll help me now? Yeah, yeah. She's got him eating out of her claw. You stay put, or the cuffs go on. I mean it. Calling me a killer? The whole time, he's driving like a maniac! I mean, look at this car! This is unit 5-3. I need a home address in Shadyside for a Mr. Emmanuel Bergman. He's an attorney. This guy is a cop? Well, he's been suffering from job-related stress lately. It's about 7 blocks up. Thanks. Sir, could you let me powder my nose? Oh, yeah. Sure! Absolutely. Go ahead. I am Dracula. Oh... It's really good to see you. I don't know what happened to the driver and my luggage and... Well... And with all this, I... I thought I was in the wrong place. I bid you welcome. Listen to them. Children of the night. What music they make! I swear on my mother, he was dead, and this ain't no improvement. A spider spinning his web for the unwary fly. Blood is the light, Mr. Renfield. Gennaro. What about Gennaro, Sal? He's here. What do you mean, Sal? They probably stashed that prick in an underground bunker somewhere. You'll like it. Aren't you drinking? I never drink... Wine. Hey, Sal, wait a minute. No, Sallie! Don't, Sallie! No, Sallie! No, Sallie, don't! The boys will check it out! Jesus Christ! Everything all right? Stevie, uh... Gennaro split. Fuck! I don't need this. Mmm. Sal! Sal! Sal! Oh, my god! Don't, Sal! Don't kill him here! Boys, boys, help! Help! Sal, listen to me. You're losing it. Don't murder a cop on my lawn! Sal! Forgive me, Sal. You've got to get ahold of yourself. Come on. Come inside. Please. Can you believe this cocksucker? Show up here, huh? Where's the gun? Oh, he's got cuffs! Let's cuff him. You see, Sal? Now that you're inside, you're in an excellent situation. No blood. Even if the cops came with a search warrant to talk to Macelli, I'd tell them to get a Ouija board because he's dead. There's nothing in the fucking constitution clearer than freedom from unreasonable searches, and this isn't unreasonable, it's demented. The government can't pronounce a man dead then invade his home looking for him. You really whacked me, but there ain't no blood. What a guy, Manny. Hey, Sallie! Manny, I... I need you. Sal, come on! You always do for me. Do for me, Manny. It's O.K. It'll be O.K. Do this! Aah! Aah... The walls around are bare, echoing to our laughter, as though the dead were there. Ha ha! Nice little sentiment! But there's more, even nicer. Quaff a cup to the dead already. Ah-choo! Oh, never mind the rest, dear! That son of a bitch is heavy! To die, be really dead... That must be glorious. Why, count Dracula! There are far worse things... Awaiting man... Than death. Manny? Manny? Aah! Out light! You killed him. Nah! Ha! Resting. He's dead. They said I was dead. I ask you... am I dead? I got this tingle. There's something you can do for me. Aah! This shirt is disgusting. This fat bastard. Come on! What's he got, lead in his ass? 1... 2... 3! Ugh! Please! Help me! God! God, please help me! My Manny! Manny, Manny, Manny! Lenny! Lenny, look! Please help me! Please! Help me! Help me! Help me! Oh, here's Sal! Sal! Come on! Hurry the fuck up. Oh, god, somebody help me! Why don't you help me? Help me! Stop! Please stop! Oh! Please stop the car! Help me! He killed my Manny. He ate my Manny! He wha... he... he... He killed my Manny! He ate Manny! Steve, what's happening? You find Joe? For Christ's sake, will you talk to me? Come on! Ugh! I'm going to grind you down to blood... And screams. Hey, Joey, we're going to take this nice and slow... So why don't you take your shoes off, get comfortable? Whoa! Hey, come on! No, stop! Hey, come on! Sal, this is going to get all over my coat. I want him alive! Hey! Hey! Stop, for Christ's sake! Son of a bitch. Would you please help me in the car? He shot my fucking foot! Oh, shit! If you had just left him to me, I would have stopped him before he fed. Now he's 100 times more dangerous. Who did Macelli eat? Some guy named Manny. An innocent person dead because you screwed up! Manny Bergman? He wasn't innocent. He's a lawyer. Maybe he's not dead. Maybe I have to finish him, too. Or what? He becomes like Macelli or becomes like you? Macelli's nothing like me. He's a cold-blooded killer. And what are you? Yeah. Hey! Jesus Christ! Heh heh heh heh! What the hell you doing? We're on his ass! It's over for now. You two want a room? Yes. No! You know what Macelli was. I know what he's become. If we stick together, we can find him. I could find him right now. Just help me get out of these cuffs. Try that little key there. Macelli's got to get inside. We should do the same. You look beat. You look a little drained yourself. I'm fine. You lost a lot of blood. Are you sure you don't need more? Don't worry. You're not my type. Aah! What is this shit? What the fuck? Gee, Mr. Macelli. I never seen you here so early. Is there something wrong? Mr. Macelli, you want I should, uh, call somebody? This is good. Leave me alone. Shut the door. But you're in the freezer... get out! Hit the fucking lights! Yeah, OK. Yeah, in my cold storage! He's got a rump roast for a pillow! Thank you. We have a deal? We'll be staying till sundown... 7:17 P.M. She insists it was Macelli and that Joe Gennaro was loaded into the back of Macelli's limo. Then find them... Macelli and Gennaro... and you better hope Gennaro's still alive. Oh, fellas. Try not to lose your car this time. Yes, ma'am. Yes, ma'am. Dr. Kivowitz says you'll be fine, Manny. You just need a transfusion. Mr. Bergman, we know Macelli did this. He also tried to assault your wife. Can I count on you to press charges? Bergman? Bergman? You're OK. You're going to be fine. You've been in there a long time. You having trouble with that deep-down clean? I thought you'd be asleep by now. Dream on. I'm trusting you to see I don't get any sun. Can I trust you? It's kind of a one-way street, this trust thing. You can trust me. Right. My eyes are sensitive. I know you're good, Joe. A good man. I see that. I feel that. Yeah, well, see this, and feel this... get the fuck away from me. I won't hurt you. Just get over there on the bed. Chicken shit. Sleep tight. Hiya, bill. G'day, Haynes. You better win at Southampton tomorrow. Park these in a lucky spot for a few hours. Aah! Aah! Aah! Aah! My god! Fuck! Aah! We have to go. I can't. Now's the time to get Macelli. He's sleeping. He will sleep if he's not disturbed, but his senses are razor-sharp. He can wake like that and move like this. Aah! You need me, Joe. You really do. I can't do this. What happens when you get excited? Pretty much as usual, Joe. Yeah, but maybe you bite. Right now, I need this more than blood. Face it... You trust me. At least, partially. Still a little worried here. How can we stop this worry? Think I can have your name now? Marie. Marie. Where is everybody? Close the door! Lenny, what's the fucking emergency? What happened to you? Someone shot me in the foot. Why? What's going on, Lenny? He had me call you, said it was something important. Frank, ray, listen to the guy. Look at the guy! Tell me if it's not time to pass the torch. You got Macelli in there? I'm just saying, look at the man. Hiya, boys! Sa... Sallie. How you feeling, boss? Oh, I feel fucking fantastic! I can hear an angel fart. I heard you, Lenny. Sal. Come over here. Come here. Come on. Yeah. Lenny... I loved you... Like a brother. You son of a bitch. Aah! Stop! No! Aah! Grrr! Don't you fucking move! Put Lenny in the trunk and get me some clean clothes. Yeah. Yeah. You must help me find Macelli, and when we find him, we kill him. Understand? Let's go. Voila. Hey, guys, want to party? Open the trunk. We're in the middle of the street. Open the trunk. Think what you're doing. Open the fucking trunk. Jesus. Lenny. Lenny. Huh? Yeah. Come on, Lenny. Easy. Come on. Hey, easy, Lenny, easy. I'm not going to hurt you. You're family now. Can you help me? Grrr! Come on, Lenny. Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Hey! Hey! Hey! You look good enough to eat. Awoo! Whoa! Can I help you gents? Sallie? I heard you was... So listen, Sallie, I hope you like Remy Martin, 'cause horse just sent us over 50 cases from a truck they jacked on 95. Take a dozen... Two dozen! Would you tell Tommy to get over here? Yeah. You got it. Frankie, is Sal O.K.? Oh, yeah. He's a fucking peach. Come on. Yeah. Boys... You don't know how big this is going to be, but it's going to be fucking amazing. You're going to be made men. But when you're made by me, nobody can touch you. So fuck the gambinos. They think there's a war, but it's over. And fuck the Colombians and the Jamaicans, too. The Macelli family... We're going to take this town. Grrr! Aah! Aah! Aah! Frankie... Welcome to the family. Aah! Aah! He's not here. Those guys swell up like roosters when he's around. I brought Vinnie. Boys... I want you to meet Frank and ray. But, uh... We know Frank and ray. You don't know them... Like this. Grrr! Grrr! He's not in Bloomfield. Let's try the melody lounge downtown. OK. Let's go. Let's go. He's here. He's upstairs. Excuse me, honey. Hey, come on, man. Hey, shut up. Shut up. Freeze! On the floor now! They're on something. Where's Macelli? Anywhere I want to be. Aah! Oh, shit. Closed. Hey. Hey! Hey! Closed! Where's Macelli, Gus? You... The scumball cop. I don't know where Sal is. You leave your address, and I'll make sure he looks you up. I ain't even breaking a law if I break your head. I'll swing on you. I'm a girl. Some girl. Uh! Whoa! I'm going to eat your face like a chicken. Grrr! Grrr! Aah! Grrr! You broke my fucking teeth! Don't! Shoot her, Joe! Shoot her! Shoot her! Shoot her! Shoot her, Joe! Will you fucking shoot her, Joe? She's OK. She's a fucking monster! She's one of them! She's with me. Yeah? Joe... Joe, you all right? Yeah. Where's Macelli? He's here somewhere. He took the other guys out of here. We got to get out here. Call backup. Tell them what we're up against. I'll try, man. I will try. We got the muscle. We got the hunger. We'll crack this town like a lobster. Let's call it a night. Ha ha ha ha ha! Yeah. Hey... Little girl... I got a question for you. You gave me something, and I like it. Why did you give me this thing and then try to shoot me? Well, Sallie... I'm pretty fucked up about men. Uh! You know, I might actually miss you. Uh! I'm OK. Get him. Heh heh heh heh yeah! Get him! Ah ha ha! Jesus! Grrr! Grrr! No! Fuck! Hey, man! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Where the fuck did you learn to drive? Come on. Heh heh heh heh heh! Yeah. Hey, you fuck! You think you can kill me? Ah ha ha! What you killed here is my fucking suit! I am the power! You fucking cockroach! I... Am the light! I... Am... Macelli! Marie. No! Where are you going? To watch a sunrise. You don't want to die. I died a long time ago. Joe! Don't make me hurt you. I love you. Come on. I take lives. Yeah, well... If you were perfect... You wouldn't still be single. He made me feel... Alive. And I thought... Why not? Captioning made possible by Warner Bros.
