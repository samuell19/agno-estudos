DARK DRUMS I, Lieutenant Richard Tufts, of the US Navy, I will relate my dangerous trip to the territory of Florida, in the year 1840. I didn't know anything about Florida, except this map that told me very little of the risky mission he was on. This was the scene of the fiercest war in our history. The war against savage and bloodthirsty enemies . The Seminole Indians. For 7 years we were being defeated by the Redskins. They hit upon the strategy of our Chief General, Zachary Taylor. I was ordered to serve under their command, so I'm sailing. My ship skirted the unknown Atlantic coast of Florida, until you reach a bay. They left me on a little boat that would play a big role in the expedition that awaited me. Lieutenant Tufts of the Nortfolk frigate. Introduce yourself to Captain Quincy. This explorer will escort you to a kid. My special mission had begun. Just as planned my boat crawled to the beach to move it to an inland lake called Okeechobee, where I expected, and hardly counted on it, to see him again. With my strange guide I went inside in search of the man she knew only as Captain Quincy Wyatt. We rode north through almost impenetrable territory which did not seem to offer obstacles to my silent companion. Tie them up, sailor. - Are you sure Captain Wyatt is here? - Your little one is very close. What is a chiqui? - Have you been to Florida before? - No. I imagined it when I saw the ornamental saber that he carries. A chiqui, is a thatched roof hut built on dry land. It's a house. Does the captain live here, and why not in the garrison? Because we are in Florida. Don't do that, he's a Georgia Basin Creek , he's a Quincy servant. Hi, Joy. Shaking hands with an Indian is like drawing water from a well. Get in the canoe, Lieutenant. These Indians are kind of smelly. They rub skunk fat on their bodies to scare off mosquitoes. We move slowly down a strange and wonderful stream, winding through bright green territory. This was the land for which we fought so fiercely. A jungle. Hermosa. Mysterious. Mortal. Feel like chewing some corn? We have a long way to go. No thanks. Don't believe those who say that Seminole Indians can't shoot. Since they got rifles they have learned to shoot very well. Why does the captain live so isolated? After what happened, he does not like being around soldiers. He doesn't deal with anyone except his own men. I know you want to ask me what happened, but I won't be the one to tell you. And I wouldn't ask Quincy in his place either . Despite myself, my curiosity was piqued. What officer was he who was fleeing the army in which he served? But the blazing sun above my head tore the question out of my head. Then where the stream widened into a pond, situated between sky and water, there was an island. Shimmering like a jewel in the face of the jungle. And, in it, Captain Wyatt's little boy. Hi, Hang. Do you see what I was saying? Will come. He wants to know what it is for. It is the first time you have seen a saber and someone like you. He is a lovely boy. Does it belong to one of those Creeks Indians? He is the son of Captain Wyatt. I'm sorry. What do you feel? Nothing, just ... Where is your squaw? I want to meet her. The captain's wife was no squaw, Lieutenant. She was a Creek princess, daughter of her great chief and she was beautiful, but he will not meet her. She's dead. For the first time, I saw the man with whom I was going to share the most extraordinary adventure of my life. Quincy Wyatt. Military. Inhabitant of the swamps. Caballero. Wild. Look at those two eagles. Do you see them? Quincy never comes back from hunting or fishing without bringing them something. Hi, Quincy. I brought you a sailor who wants to see you. Lieutenant Tufts, US Navy Delighted, any problem when disembarking? No, sir, we go unnoticed. How long do you think it will take to transport your boat overland to the lake? Before answering that, sir, I would like to say that I feel sorry for you. Why? My boat only has room for 40 men. It's okay. Those are all the men left from my company. 40 men to cross Florida and take a fortress? That is suicide. Maybe, but someone has to cut off the weapons supply to the Seminoles. As long as that fort is still there, the Indians will continue to receive them. A small-scale attack will fail. The fort Infanta was made by General García, a great Spanish architect. It is impossible to take it with less than one brigade. What you say is alarming, did you say that to General Taylor? No, the Admiral did, and the General was pretty tough on him. The Admiral thinks the General drinks too much. Maybe he's right, he sure was drunk when he came up with this plan. I'm sorry you think the plan is stupid because I'm the one who came up with it. As for my 40 men, in the swamp they behave like a brigade. If you'll excuse me, I'll change my clothes and we'll go to headquarters. Wow, I screwed up all the way. There are worse places around here where you can screw up. Look at the other shore of the lagoon. It's the beginning of the Everglades. Or the end, it depends on which way you walk. Do you know what's in there? Swamps so deep that they can swallow an entire army. I assure you that it is more dangerous to screw up there. My son liked his saber very much , he would like to have one. I understand, I also have a son of the same age in Boston. Do you know what your soul would give for? Because of the tomahawk on his belt. Is the mother of your child still alive? Yeah right. He's a lucky boy very lucky. She loves that child deliriously. If something happened to you, you would go into a swamp and you would never see it. We made our way quickly to headquarters. I was looking forward to meet the man who was trying to end the war once and for all. El general Zachary Taylor. - All ready, Quincy? - All ready. You can still back out if you want to. Nothing will stop me except the Seminoles. If you don't, you're going to make me a very important general. That is something I plan to do anyway. Destroy that fort, Quincy, and I'll be on my way. We may finally see peace in this territory. Attention! To form! In a row of two! - Ready for inspection, captain. - And the replacements? - The best in the army. - They will have to be. Peachtree, the stripes suit you very well. I hope to handle them as well as Corporal Mallory, sir. - He is worthy of them. - Thank you Captain. Glad to see you alive, Tibbett. I hardly get it, but it's hard to separate myself from my scalp. - As it is called? - James Tasher, sir. - Did you fight the Indians before? - Yes, in the Black Hole territory. I won't ask him how he got out of there because he's here. - And by what name do you answer? - Private Jessup, sir. How long have you been in the military? I enlisted in the Massachusetts Riflemen. 3 years, 8 months and 26 days ago. I'll see to it that your enlistment period ends . Lieutenant, what do you think of them? I would say they are soldiers. But they don't look like soldiers. Maybe not, but Oscala would give a handful of pearls for one of their heads. And a whole basket for Quincy's. And your coming with us makes yours valuable too. What's up, Mohair? Any complaints? - As it happens, yes. - The food is terrible, the uncomfortable mattress, the huge mosquitoes and the sergeant treats him badly. How the hell do you know that, Captain? Glad to hear all is well, Mohair. - They look very good, sergeant. - Thank my Lord. - Let's get going. - Yes sir. Over the shoulder! Weapons! Right! Head on! What do you think of the expedition now? I'd rather keep my opinion until we get there and come back. For that we have your boat, if it floats. Forward, explorers! In the company of that strange troop, we marched towards the lake to meet my little boat. There is. Lake Okeechobee, that's what the Indians call it. The big water. It's 50 miles to the other shore, and there are the Seminoles. Wow, it looks like it floats. - We set sail, Bosun. - Yes sir. Unfold the mainsail! A black candle, right? So the Indians will not see it in the moonlight. As we go along, this plan seems less and less stupid to me. If there are problems and we have to part , try to come back here. The boat will pick us up tomorrow at sunset, underway. On going. Do you smell it? The gulf. The bay is there, the fort would have to be there. I've been doing calculations. I think we've drifted about eight miles north. Let's take a look. I'd better do my math again. From the looks of those walls, I'd better redo mine. At dusk, I will take some men and go to the door. The rest will wait until you can open it. Arms dealers. Hopefully tonight we'll ruin their business. Get out the horses and mules. Shane! - Take the squad and find the arsenal. - Yes sir. - Lieutenant, disable all cannons. - Well. ¡Peachtree! Set up the dynamite charges and let's get out of here right away. - Yes sir! - Successful expedition. There have been no problems. We haven't left here yet. Sullivan! Search all rooms. - Mohair. - Yes sir. - How many casualties have there been? - I'm counting them right now. Give it a hand. Captain! We found the arsenal. With all this , the 100-year war could be won . Made in Europe. These self-sacrificers have brought weapons from everywhere. Set it on fire. Captain, we have found these prisoners. - There's no more? - Yes sir, there's more out there. - Take them there. We can not wait. - Yes sir. Who is that gentleman who seems to be annoying? It's Captain Wyatt, ma'am. Amelia, bring my coat. Captain Wyatt says we can go. Thank God he's come. We have been captive for two months, my poor wife - and these hostages. - Yes, they are safe now. Cannons disabled. The charges are set. The highlights are ready. Wait for my signal. - Shane, get them out of here. - Yes sir. When this fort explodes, the Seminoles will know where we are. Quicken your pace, there is not much left to go. We're going very fast. It is impossible. My wife is ill, she cannot continue. We cannot stop. ¡Hiff! Carry it on your back. ¡Wyatt! Put the guard on the flanks and the scouts in the rear. They can eat, but no fire. And don't smoke. If you want tobacco, more than that. How is the lady? You will not be able to resist it. Where they are? He and Mrs. Duprez owned a plantation. The others worked for them. These renegades set fire to the plantation and then kidnapped them. And what about her? Nobody knows much about her. I'd say she's a classy lady. Why, because he has a maid? About dangerous swamps, right there is the Everglades. It's a swamp that I would never want to get into because if I did I would never come out again. Ah from the shore! What happen? Something is wrong, everything is very quiet. I do not like. We are all a little nervous. Indian warriors, come this way quickly. Down! Peachtree, send in the rear. ¡Tibbett, vamos! Spin! Spin! Spin! Come back! Come back, you idiots! They will kill you! Come back here, you idiots! They will kill you! Behind! We cannot contain them, they are too many. Well over there. To the swamps? - Yes, to the swamps, go. - Let's go! Come on! ¡Wyatt! Now you will die! ¿Me oyes, Wyatt? You will die! They are sending a letter. They have received the mail. Signed by Chief Oscala. And all the Indians in the Everglades are reading it. Listen to me all. I guess they know we 're in a pretty tight spot. We are cut off from our ship. There is only one way home and it is through 150 miles of swamp. So our only alternative is to walk. So let's get going. I do not agree with you. I admit that you are in command and that I am only a naval observer. But in this situation, I think my opinion should be taken into account. What is your opinion, Lieutenant? My boat is in that lake. And if I know Bosun, he will search the lake for us. I consider that there is not as much danger as it implies. I suggest we spend the night here and then get back on board. Keep talking, Lieutenant. I am not insubordinate, I only give my opinion on the strategy ... Let's go! You are a lucky man. Do you know what kind of snake it was? A swamp viper. How does a lady like you know such things? I've dealt with a lot of snakes, Lieutenant. Walk, walk. Alligators! Alligators! Tell these Creeks when you last saw the captain's group. They entered the swamps 200 yards from the landing point. They were heading south. Do you know the place? They know him well. That's why they say Wyatt has a one in a thousand chance of getting out alive. If anyone can help them, it is them, but only heaven knows where they will be now. We go deeper and deeper into the great swamp. It seemed that when fleeing death at the hands of the Seminoles, .. we were heading to certain death in that damned jungle. We will rest here for a moment. Are you thinking the same as me? They cannot walk anymore. A couple of trees would be fine, right? It would take too long to build canoes for everyone. He wasn't thinking about the whole group, only half of it. We can't stay here. Those Indians are stepping on our backs. They cannot keep walking, but we have to carry on. Continue to where, Quincy? Do you remember the mounds of the Indian cemetery? The ones we ran into looking for Major Dale? It is in the center of the Seminole territory. We won't be there forever. Whoever builds the canoes won't be able to stay long. You and Monk will go overland with your platoon. I'll stay with the Peachtree group. You can't do that, Captain, I 'm not going to have you killed. I'll stay, and you two will go. When this started, I was giving the orders and this is how it will end. Sullivan, if I don't come back, there's a jug of liquor in my trunk for you. On these occasions I would like to be my cousin, he is in the cavalry. Rejoice, Mohair, if you are killed, you may be reincarnated on a horse. If I do, don't walk after me because I'd kick you on the head. There is a tough road ahead, but they have to achieve it in 4 days. With a little luck, we will catch up with them. Get going, Shane, good luck. Forward, soldiers! On going! Don't be late, Quincy. He has been very kind sharing his ration with me. It's not important. When those canoes are finished it won't be long before to be able to eat well. The first thing I want to eat is some colbert mushrooms like Paul made them at the Griffin Club in Savannah. Savannah said? I know her well, I was stationed there for a year. Then surely he would dine at the club. Sorry to disappoint you, Navy Lieutenants, We rarely visit Griffin clubs. If you ever go back to Savannah, you will eat there, I promise you. Well, you see, I have visited the Dolphin Society several times. No doubt it will have been there. Sure, the poetry readings on Tuesdays were splendid. Yes. I found it one of the best activities in society. What are your favorite poets? I have a predilection for Shelley. I also. The last poem I read was a wonderful ode to a bird. But I assure you, I cannot remember what bird it was. Yes, wasn't it the robin? No, I don't think it was. Well, I'll remember. A most refined and very interesting conversation . Excuse me, I have to take care of something. Do you mind if I accompany you, Captain? Well, this is not the Griffin club, but you can have a seat. - Have you been to Savannah too? - No. Tell me. Don't you blush talking like you're a fine girl - a peasant like you? - A peasant? Only a peasant can recognize another. What part of Georgia is he from? From Okefenokee, I grew up on squirrel meat and walnuts, just like you. - How did you discover me? - Because of the way he walks. We tied the legs of 16-year-old girls to put them the first pair of shoes. It's what happened to you. I still have the string marks on my shins. That pompous way of speaking was not learned in Okefenokee. Where have you wandered? Charleston, Savannah, New Orleans, where the gold coins ring. There is not much money around here. What are you doing here? I was leaving New Orleans for Savannah when my ship was robbed For those renegades he killed And the rest of the passengers? The renegade leader may not have found them ... ... as interesting as me. How did you get on with him? You found me in that dungeon. He locked me there to consider. And he did? The rats were getting bigger every day. You arrived just in time. You have not come here just to talk to me, what worries you? Since you ask, I'm curious if I'll get out of here alive. Why should you know more than others? Because I have a lot to do. I've been making plans for a long time for them to end up in the swamp. The only thing I can tell you, To reassure her a bit, I am not going to commit suicide. It was a pleasure eating with you. I hope you liked the colbert mushrooms . What happened to your face, Lieutenant? I hit myself with a branch. The branches are terrible, especially if you don't have soap. Good. Let the advance guard come and charge to march. We'll do it right away, sir. Let Evans and Smith come. The rest load the equipment. Did you like the bathroom? It seems I didn't go far enough downstream. I saw some Seminoles up in the trees. They couldn't be Seminoles, he still has his hair. Do you mean the soldiers were spying on her? Why didn't you call me? Are you sure he wasn't there, Lieutenant? Please! To the canoes! Captain Wyatt! Captain Wyatt! We will camp here for a few hours. We stay here, you can eat. Thanks, Corporal. We can eat. I have eaten so much corn that I look like a chicken. Search something? I'm just thinking. Thinking about? How much material would it take to make suede pants ... ... that feel good. A shiny pair of boots. An elegant jacket ... ... in a fine shirt and silk tie. He would look imposing going down Drayton Street in Savannah. Maybe I had him walking down that street But here he would look like a fucking madman. Would you like to go to Savannah? No. What a pity. I was having an idea ... ... in which he was involved. But he likes this kind of life better. Not especially where we are now, but ... ... the place where I live is wonderful. What's so wonderful about it? I should know it. I wake up in the morning and I can't wait to go fishing - or hunt a deer. - Always be running and sweating. Brambles and thorns crawl up your neck ... ... and then you end up getting bitten by mosquitoes and eating a squirrel. Perhaps. But at night you sleep like a king. Yes. Cold and lonely. I guess you wouldn't want to go back to that kind of life. Truth? Good evening, Your Majesty. Have. This will serve to quiet their guts. Fish and turtle, just fish and turtle. I'm starting to get guts. If you want to go hunting, you better shoot your shots far from here. I wouldn't mind shooting right now and getting this over with. We will never get out of here. I don't like hearing them talk like that. Listen to me all. Sergeant Shane and his platoon await us in the Indian cemeteries. Do you know where we will be then? One step away from my island, and we will be safe there. We'll send someone to the barracks from there and get out of it alive. Now eat your fish and get moving. Guys, you have heard the captain, to eat fish without question. Dreaming of Savannah? How did you know? Is that the most important thing to you? It's very important. Is it the only thing that matters to you? Leave me, get away from me. You sure like the fine people of Savannah. I don't like them, I hate them. So he's got that thorn in. He wants revenge on the whole city. Not from the whole city, just from one man. The one who tied her legs? I tied them myself. He was the one who put my shoes on. Luxury shoes? It did not start that way. But that's how it ended. Had nothing to object? He was too young to object to something. My father did have some. But he was a peasant, and the rich know how to handle the poor. One morning I found him dead in the field. They said he had been hit by a car. But I've never seen a car that leaves whip marks. Do you have any way to do justice? Of course. I have been preparing for this for many years. When I return they will know that the rich are not the only ones in handling a leather whip. When you were chatting with me yesterday taking measurements for that suit, Where did i fit in? Maybe you thought it would help you handle that whip? It's possible. I'll see her in the canoe. Day after day We continue sailing to meet the sergeant and his men. One day at sunset, rounding a bend in the stream, everything became silent. You couldn't even hear the singing of the birds. It became difficult to breathe. The air seemed charged with death. They didn't need to tell us that finally ... ... we were approaching the mounds. The legendary cemetery of the Seminoles. They're not here. - They should be here. -Yes. I do not like this. I do not like. We will wait. Do you know how the Seminoles bury their brave warriors? They sit them with their war paintings. They put a bowl of food next to him, his favorite weapon in his hands and ... ... then they cover them completely. If he's a big boss like that over there, the first newborn is thrown into his grave after his death. Why do they do a thing like that? Because they believe that when they die their spirit leaves their body and passes to the first newborn. And since they respect the memory of their boss, they don't want you to be reincarnated as someone who doesn't have your authority. I can talk to you? It's not that men are afraid But they think we should get out of here That's impossible, we are waiting for the sergeant. Yeah, yeah, but ... ... how the sergeant was supposed to get there before us ... Well, it may not come. We will wait. Tell others. Do you also think we should get out of here? - Do you ask or assure? - Both. You have affection for the sergeant and that old trapper, right? I also have affection for those who are here. That complicates things. And you still want to go back to Savannah? What do you want me to say? That I never want to go back to Savannah? Also, why are you asking me? You have already decided. I know it will stay. ¡Capitán Wyatt! Someone is coming. Take cover. They hide. It's Monk! Where's Shane? What happened? I stepped forward to lead the group. When I realized it, the Seminoles had surrounded them. I was able to escape, but they opened fire on the platoon. I've never seen anything like it. Did anyone else escape? Shane? I don't know, it was like a slaughterhouse. - Seminoles, captain, they are coming here. - Let's get out of here, come on, quick. - Can you walk, Monk? - I've practiced a lot. Forget the canoes, they will look for us in the river. Quick, move on. Come on, everyone in the water, hurry. Faster. Someone is coming. He's wearing Shane's uniform! I'll get you talking, captain. That won't do. I know how to treat these vermin. Monk. Athens. Here's Quincy, she's gorgeous. Be careful. Watch out. He says there is a town. Ours are there. - They may still be alive. - There may be a hundred Seminoles. They are looking for us. - There will be a few watching. - Can we believe him? We will soon know. Peachtree, stay with the women. The others, come with me. What's up, Mohair? I have found them. I wish I hadn't. - If I see another Seminole I won't kill him ... - Stop it! ¡Capitán Wyatt! ¡Capitán Wyatt! ¡Seminolas! Take cover! We will hold on. Take the women away. Move! Fire at will! Let's go! Don't stop there, keep moving forward. I'll take you, captain. It's useless, he's dead. Go now. Monk, take them to my island, it's very close to here, they'll be safe there. - I'll keep them at bay. - Captain. Go with them. I will take them away from here. ¡Tibbett! Come on, red devils, follow me! ¡Tibbett! We are here, come get us! Come on, red bulldogs! Sniff around here! What about Captain Wyatt? No sign of him, sir. Let's abandon the search. Cross Wyatt and his men off the list. Did you manage to reach the island and rescue your son? No, there was a wall of Indians between us and the island. The swamp Seminoles are on the warpath. We will start the attack there and try to save your son. We owe it to them. Colonel, gather the brigade, we 'll leave as soon as they're assembled. Come on, don't slow down now, we're reaching my island. There is! We did it! What are you waiting for? Come on, let's go! We have a long way to go. ¡Alto! We will not run anymore. We will stay here and fight. We'll die anyway, let's kill a few first. We will make trenches and fight right here. Yes very good. Take cover! Stop the fire! It seems we have made it difficult for him. It is getting dark. They still don't like fighting at night. But they will come back screaming at dawn. I like the moonlight more than ever. Spread the word. Have beware of traps. Mohair! Yes? Mohair, I heard something. Shut up for once. Well, it seems that my saber will end up in very strange hands. Men often come up with excellent plans ... ... that never come to fruition. He was going to give it to Captain Wyatt's son. Your son? That's. Didn't you know you had a son? Yes. He was a beautiful 6 year old boy. He had black hair and brown eyes. Wyatt married a Creek princess. She was a beautiful woman. Now they are both dead. He may not be dead. Perhaps he has escaped. I also thought the same about his mother. Until I found her murdered. That is why he fights against them. - That's why he hates the Seminoles so much. - The Seminoles didn't kill her. It was the soldiers. Soldiers? Did they kill her? So how can ... Wondering how it could happen? How can I be with them? ¿No? He wonders how I can go on living without taking revenge. You see ... ...they were young, they were drunk, they were new to this territory ... ... and all Indians looked the same to them. Clearly, he could have killed anyone in uniform. But depending on what type of person you are, you feel something inside you ... ... and you hold back. You can't spend your life trying to get revenge. You cannot hold a grudge all your life. - You got ahead of me. - I'm sure more will come. Watch the shore well. Pay attention. Soon it will dawn and they will come for us. I estimate that we will liquidate about 100. No one may have to liquidate anyone. Except... ...only one. Go back to the women. If something goes wrong, you know what to do. And don't be a chicken at the last minute. Don't do it, Quincy, don't even try. Now you're not okay. Do what I say. Let's go. ¡Oscala! Oscala! Do you hear me? ¡Oscala! Are you a slut who treacherously dispatches your warriors? Are you so afraid of Wyatt that you surround yourself with your tribe so as not to confront me? Why are you challenging him? If Quincy kills him, maybe the rest of the Seminoles will cower and leave. Don't hide and fight with me where the crocodiles have to be, in water. Meet me with your own weapon. The knife. This could have been a great day, Quincy. Yes. Yes. It is! Of course it is! Quincy. I want to make sure it's you. I left you for dead a hundred times. And I thought I would never see my son again. We found him about 10 miles from here, hidden in the jungle. That proves once again that it is impossible to kill a Wyatt. It won't be because they haven't tried. With what you've done, even a general will be safe in the swamps. If I haven't been out in a month, come in and get me out. Have. I'd love for him to have it, if he still wants it. Is for you. I think you could take this to him too ... ... your little one. Thank you very much, I will tell you how valuable it is. Okay, I hope everything goes the way you want it in Savannah. I do not think it is like that, because I'm not going. You cannot hold a grudge all your life.
