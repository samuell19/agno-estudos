Help! ♪ (Truck horn blowing) Why are we stopping here? We are a few blocks away from the White House. I don't think we need to get any closer. Remember what we got in this thing. What's wrong with fireworks? Danny, the fireworks are illegal in most states. That's why they stopped me back there. I had to prove to them I was going to a legal state. So that's why you don't want to drive up to the president's place? Not a good idea. Pennsylvania Avenue's closed. The road's closed? Mm-hmm. For security reasons, public transportation's not allowed. The only way you can get to the house is by foot. Now Danny, when you get through dropping Teddy off, you can ride over to Jersey with me to drop the explosives off and ride back to California with me. Really? Really. (Laughing) That's my boy. (Truck door opening) Here we go, son. You all right? Thanks. This is it. You're a brave kid, Danny. And you're a good person too. You're a good boy, Teddy. Yes, you are. It's been an honour meeting the first dog. Now I've got to find a place, to park this big old monster. Here's my cell phone number. Don't lose it. Call me when your mission's complete, and we'll hook back up. Now you can see it from here, the big needle in the sky. What is that? That's the Washington Monument. The White House is close to it. Just follow the needle. Thanks. ♪ I guess it's time to say goodbye. I have to give you back now. It's the right thing to do, right? You have a home, you have a family. You belong there.

No! ♪ Big Mike's number. They've taken the president's dog away. MAN, OVER INTERCOM: Who has? The dog catcher. If the dog catcher's got your dog, there's nothing I can do about it. Look, can't you tell the president? He's the only one who can save him now. The president doesn't have time to save your dog. I told you it's not my dog. Run along, kid. ♪ PRESIDENT: So remember, do the right thing. ♪ (Siren whooping) Hey there, young man. Where are you going? I have to see the president. Aren't you a little young to be worried about political issues? They've taken Teddy. Well, the president can't help you with that. Why don't you come with me, and maybe I can help. You're going to help me find Teddy? Well, first I need to know who you are. I'm Danny. You got a last name, Danny? Milbright. All right, Danny Milbright. Let's see if my computer can find you. So, what you in for? Trying to return the president's dog, running away from a foster home and stealing a hot dog. What are you in for? Armed robbery. Why would they send him to Asia? Not Asia, stupid. Euthanasia. That means they put him down. Put him to sleep? Forever. Usually hold him a few days, and if no one claims him... Food fight! No! No! I have to save Teddy! No! No!

Danny, tell me more about what caused this explosion in you. They're going to kill Teddy. Who? The men in black? Danny you've got to understand there are no men in black, this dog doesn't exist and he doesn't belong to the President of the United States. You've created them in your mind, probably since your parents' accident. Excuse me. Sorry. Sir, the boy has visitors. It's okay. They work for the government.

Nice to meet you, Mr. Woodroffe President. Or that too. Have a seat. I want to thank you for bringing Teddy back to Washington, and tell you what a brave thing you did. I kind of messed up. Kind of messed up? No. No, you didn't. The main thing is Teddy's back and he's safe, and it's because of you. Danny, you did the right thing. STUART: Excuse me, Mr. President. Yes, Stuart? Mr. Kesser, the official White House photographer would like to take some photos with you and Danny. That's a good idea. Would you like that, Danny? Okay. STUART: Sir? You okay? ♪ So, what happens to him now? PRESIDENT: I believe they're sending a social worker to fly with him back to the foster home in California. Danny, how would you like to have dinner with us and the Prime Minister of Canada? But Mr. Brentwood said it's time to leave now. Well the president and I have some authority over Mr. Brentwood, and we would like you to stay. Okay. Okay? Yeah? Mr. Brentwood? Great. (Phone ringing) Yeah? This is Robert Woodroffe calling from the White House. Is June Angell there? Who is this? It's the President of the United States. Give me... (Giggling) Sit down. Oh, oh, oh. Hello? PRESIDENT: Mrs. Angell? Yup, that's me. This is Robert Woodroffe. The President. This is Robert Woodroffe, the President of the United States? Sure you are. You... You... Mr. Woodroffe... I mean, you're... You are the president. You are the President. You are the President of the United States. Oh, Mr. Woodroffe. I mean... I mean, Mister... I'm sorry, sir. Mr. President. We've made arrangements for a social worker to bring Danny back to California to your foster home. I... I don't... I was informed that he was in juvenile hall. It's all been worked out. I... I... I don't understand, sir. How did you come across Danny? He's a very brave and noble lad, Mrs. Angell. He went through quite a bit to return my dog to me. Your... Your dog? You mean Teddy really is your dog? He sure is. I'm indebted to Danny for bringing him back to Washington safely. I didn't have any idea. I mean, I thought that he was... I mean, he's really your dog? DANNY: Thanks again for inviting me, Mr. and Mrs. President, and for the new clothes, too. It's our pleasure, Danny. You know, Danny, the first lady tells us that you're quite the hero. She did? Here you go, Danny. Thanks. So why did you name your dog Teddy? PRESIDENT: That's a good question, Danny. I named him after a great American president named Theodore Roosevelt. Teddy's name isn't Theodore though. (Laughing) "Teddy" is a playful nickname for Theodore. And did you know that teddy bears were named after Roosevelt? Stuffed toy bears got the nickname from a famous incident that happened to Roosevelt during his presidency. What happened? Well, President Roosevelt loved to go hunting. He and his pals were out in the woods. They all had their rifles. And they see a great big bear. They take aim. They're ready to take it down. Then suddenly Roosevelt goes, "Stop!" Because there was a baby cub. It was a mother and her baby. So since he saved that baby cub, all stuffed bears in America were then called teddy bears. They have sold more teddy bears than any other stuffed animal or doll in America. DANNY: Is that President Lincoln? That is President Lincoln. The 16th President of the United States. And he was a great man. What did he do that was so great? Well, he was known for his honesty, and his compassion and his integrity. He was so respected that a national holiday was reserved in his honour. What is that? Presidents' Day. Good night, sweetheart. Good night. Sleep tight. Let me know if you need anything. Okay. Okay? Good night, you guys. Can you leave it open a crack, please? Of course. DANNY: Thanks. (Knocking) Can I come in? Um, sure. We're still awake. I just wanted to tell you how honoured Rebecca and I are to have you as a guest here at the White House. Really? You are? You sound so surprised. Well, it's just I'm Danny. Just some kid. You're not just Danny. You're not just a kid. You are a very special somebody. Back at the foster home, I'm not that special. Why do you say that? I've been there a while. Nobody really likes me. I'm never the chosen one. Well, maybe you should look at who's doing the choosing. Maybe they're not worthy of you. I've got a new motto for you. You do? Yup. We progress through strength, not weakness. Strength is what brought you to Washington. Not weakness. Think about that. Thanks. Good night. Have sweet dreams, Danny. You too, Teddy.
