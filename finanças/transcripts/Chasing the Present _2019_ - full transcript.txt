>> I didn't know what was going on in my life when I was younger. I was kind of lost, so I just drank as much as I could bottle after bottle and smoked as much weed as I could and then started taking acid. And at 16 years old, I lost my girlfriend. She overdosed on acid and committed suicide. And then I kept going to the point I was 21, and I was alone in my apartment for three days just doing coke like crazy, and I flatlined. I ate a whole bag because I thought that the cops were coming and started hallucinating and literally, I flatlined, and from that point on, I was like, I don't know what's happening in my life. I don't understand. So I quit stuff, and I became a vegetarian. And I'm not saying that everybody should be a vegetarian, but for me, that was the turning point in my life because I feel like it's the first time in my life where I started to be aware, just being more aware of what I put in my body. It didn't make sense to do a juice cleanse and then the next day, to go to the bar and get hammered. And I opened a lot of vegetarian and vegan restaurants and vegan hotel. And I'm having these healthy businesses, and I'm trying to help people. And I don't do drugs anymore. I don't do this. I don't do that. And I did all this other stuff. And I felt like I kind of got addicted to work. I mean, we can do everything that way, probably little drama still because he's friends with some of the staff. So that's stuff that we'll always deal with probably, no matter what. What happens after she signs it? Because she told me-- I haven't written her back. So I stopped those other things, and I started working like crazy amounts and became successful. And I was still waking up in the middle of the night and going to the emergency room because my heart was skipping beats, and I was having full-blown anxiety and panic attacks. Anxiety. My face is tingling. And I didn't understand what was happening. I would wake up in the middle of the night sometimes and feel this fear taking over me to the point where my heart was skipping beats, and I couldn't even speak because my face was getting so tingly and numb, and my whole body was kind of tightening up. And I don't know, I felt like I was dying. And then that's how this journey started. I was super confused because I had all this fear in me, but on the other hand, I was totally secure in terms of what the world kind of taught me. I was secure. I had a house and good job and was making money. So it didn't make sense. I didn't really understand what the hell was going on to feel these things and to have everything that I thought that I was supposed to have. So we've been traveling around the world for the last two years with the effort of me really understanding who I am better. But for me, it was a very challenging thing, and it still is. It takes focus, and it takes dedication, and it takes a really strong will to do it. >> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. >> I'm glad you made it back all right. All those places. >> Yeah. >> A long way, man. It's a long trip. >> You wouldn't go? >> I don't think so. I don't think there's anything I want to see to be on a plane for that long. >> What about baby pandas? >> Yeah, I go to Busch Gardens and see them nice and easy. >> What if we go tomorrow to China to see the baby pandas? >> I don't think so. >> When I was working, I felt like something was not right with me. I didn't really understand what it was or whatever, so going on this trip kind of helped me understand that stuff better. By doing yoga in India and doing meditation and doing all this stuff, I started to kind of figure out what was going on. Why do you hit me like that? >> Oh, I think you're cracking up on me, but it's all right. >> What do you mean? >> You're cracking up. >> Why is it cracking up? >> So you found yourself in India? Is that what you're saying? >> It's not about finding myself or something. It's about realizing-- >> Does it all feel right now? Now that you went on to India and Nepal, does it feel right now? feels good? >> It's not so hard to go to India for a month and practice yoga and feel good and being yourself and hang out with those people. And you don't have much worries. You're not working. You're away from everything. Everything's nice, and it's much easier. But it's more challenging when you go home, and you talk to your dad, you talk to your mom, you talk to friends. You try to explain the stuff that you're going through and the stuff that you learned in the East, and it's challenging. >> As I say pretty much every week, we are a social species and that our biggest core drive in life from the beginning is to connect with others. We survive simply because in infancy, we can bond with other adults who will nurture us until we reach an age where we can survive without constant care and support. So the core neural components of the brain from birth are simply, again, to establish these bonds. And these bonds are established by looking into the eye of someone-- your parents, your caregivers, the other adults-- having them see you and then express whatever state you're in through your emotions. So you're tired, you're frustrated, you're sad, you're lonely, you're vulnerable, you express that physiologically. Those times where we feel disconnected from care, from love, support, are the greatest traumas of childhood. Those negative emotions we believe are some kind of really horrible part of ourselves that we don't want to experience, and the key to soothing us which means regulating us back to a state of calmness is that experience of being seen in the eye of someone who will be empathetic and will meet these needs. >> I reckon fear, anger, anxiety, these are on a basic biochemical level, signals. Signal is communication. Communication is an attempt to create community, connection, togetherness. I suppose people feel fearful and angry because they're not being heard, and I don't necessarily mean on an individual level. But my sense is there's an aspect of spirit that's being neglected. If you ignore it, fear will happen. >> Hello, James. This is Zelda here. I have time for a session with you at 2:00 PM. I hope that suits you. Just let me know. Bye. >> Yeah, I realized actually like, well, anxiety is a big thing for me. I don't feel like I ever gave it the attention that it kind of needed. I've been looking into it and also through work with you, I feel like a lot of it comes from my childhood. But I don't know, I still have it, and I'm a little bit confused because on the trip, I've heard different things from different people. Do I have to go back to the root of every single thing in my life that could have caused anxiety, for example, when I was a kid? Or is it good enough to just sit with the anxiety when it comes up and just feel it? >> People often ask that in therapy, do I need to go into every single thing that happened in my childhood in order to really change this thing that I'm having trouble with? No, you don't. But you do need to go into it as it comes up. When you stay with things for a while, if you allow yourself to be present with them, then you start noticing something that wants to be addressed. And yes, then it's useful to deal with that. That's a useful thing to do with somebody else like have somebody guiding you in it to give enough safety in the situation. Maybe you'd like to try it out a little bit now? >> Yeah, we can. >> Yeah? Yeah, let's just take a couple of deep breaths there. Just check in with yourself if that is actually what you want to do at the moment, just so we're really sure that's the right thing to be doing now, here, now, this situation. OK, are you sure you want to try this out now? >> Yeah. >> OK. >> Boy, this is beautiful. >> This swimming pool is their swimming pool. It's in the backyard of their house, and it's very, very nice. >> Well, now we're going to go inside. >> If we were to take a survey out in the world of all 7 billion people, and we were to ask everyone, what is it that you really want in life, there would be a variety of answers from more money, better health, an intimate relationship, a family, a nicer home, but then if we were to ask everyone, but why do you want more money or a better home or an intimate relationship, they would say because I think it will make me happy. In other words, everybody seeks happiness above all else. There's nothing greater than happiness. And nearly everybody seeks happiness through the acquisition of some kind of objective experience-- an object, a substance, a state of mind, an activity, an intimate relationship, a family, et cetera. Many people at some stage in their lives begin to suspect that happiness for which they seek can never be delivered via an objective experience. And it's the madness from which the vast majority of humanity are suffering. >> I actually feel like somehow anxiety is starting to come up, and my face like a little bit tingly and-- >> Everybody really wants to be happy not just in a superficial sense. We want a sense of belonging, each of us, to this body, to this mind, to this Earth, somewhere. We want a sense of being a part of something greater than our limited sense of who we are, but what are we taught? It's not easy to figure out. You have to separate from a lot of conditioning and be able to look at it to say, Oh this is where happiness lies. >> We live in a rigidly controlled society, rigidly structured, which seeks to press us down and turn us only into vehicles for production and consumption. That's all we are supposed to be in the present set up. >> Fear and desire provoke action. They cause you to get out of the present. If you're continually being frightened, turn on your TV set, look at your own terror, death, cancer, war, famine, and then desire da da dada dum that comes inundated with beautiful imagery of whatever sex you're into. And it's very hard. It's hard. I feel like culture's got jump leads on my consciousness. It keeps sending signals that are not helpful. It's not a coincidence, is it? consumerism and capitalism? That's where we've all got to. That's what we've all generated through our consciousness. That's what we are all participating in, and enough of us seem to find it hard to go, I'm just going to participate. I'm coming off Facebook. I'm coming off Google. I'm not even going to own this phone no more. I'm not going to try and earn money. I'm just going to sit quietly by the river and breathe. I'll sit there quietly for a while and breathe. And that's the thing, I'll see if anyone's called while I've been breathing. >> I feel like all the things I do and just doing things compulsively in general, are all so that I don't have to feel like-- >> Yeah, that's it. It's OK. Try not to explain it too much. Just allow yourself to feel, James. It's OK. The more you can allow yourself to have that feeling, the easier it'll get. >> There is just one area where every one of us human beings is powerful, and that is over the choices and decisions we make about our own lives. You have enough time. You have 70, 80, 90 years if you're lucky, maybe more on this planet, maybe less-- there's a random element to life-- but you have time to make changes to your life. Even at the level of the single individual operating in society, if we choose right rather than wrong, if we choose light rather than darkness, if we choose love rather than fear, then this is going to affect everybody else. And if enough of us change ourselves, then we will change the world. >> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] >> Which tools have helped you in your life, say, maybe 20 years ago or 25 years ago? What were the things that you used in your life to heal things within yourself? >> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] >> I started to spend more time in silence and more time questioning myself. I feel that a lot of the problems that I was having were definitely related to fear, fear that I wasn't good enough, for example. Do all these different things I could see myself doing, creating lots of businesses, trying to get acknowledgment that I was good enough for myself, and I didn't really realize that until recently that I don't actually need acknowledgment from anything outside of myself. That maybe there's a way that I could feel good enough inside myself to the point where I don't need to do things for other people to feel that, or I could just feel that in myself. I could be whole in myself. >> So your anxiety's OK now? What's happening? >> No, it's better for sure because I feel like growing up with wanting to be good in school, wanting to be good at sports, wanting to do all this kind of stuff-- you know, the American dream-- you have to grow up. You have to make a certain amount of money. You have to have a certain amount of cars. You have to get the shoes that the neighbor has. You know what I mean? You know exactly what I mean. >> Well, some of it's valid. I mean, if you don't go to school, and you don't get As, you don't get a good job. There's a lot in common. >> But whatever it is, it puts a lot of pressure on us. Once you get older, you don't need that stuff. You realize you don't need that same kind of pressure from society anymore. We make our own choices. So I went on this trip to-- that stuff did create anxiety in my life. And when I was younger, I would get drunk with my friends. I'd smoke weed. I don't know how many times I did it. You didn't see anxiety. I didn't even know that that's why I was doing it, but now, I can figure out-- >> So how did you figure out that you had anxiety? When did this anxiety thing pop up? >> Just I had it. I had panic attacks when I lived in Europe. In Bali, had it a couple of times where I went to the emergency room because my heart was beating at a different rate, and I couldn't feel my face. I used to call mom sometimes and pull over on the side of the highway when I was like 20, 21, couldn't even talk. >> I'll be straight. I could tell you that I never had anxiety ever. I could fix your anxiety, a little 10% you got left, it's either a right hand or a left hook. Which would you prefer? >> You think what will fix it? >> That's the end of your anxiety. You wake up, you'll be healed. You are going to say, I don't want that shit again, so my anxiety is gone. It's all good, bro. >> Well, it wasn't all good, and now it's getting better. That's one thing that's happening. >> It should get better. I mean, 10 million miles later, and you know? >> Yeah. >> Instead of seeing it just as craziness out there, begin to see it as suffering, because we see it on ourselves. We see the suffering that a lot of these mindsets of greed and desire, wanting, and hatred and fear that are playing out in the world. We've seen that in our own minds and see the suffering, understand the suffering of it. Of course, a lot of good work, great work, can be done at alleviating and addressing the symptoms of the suffering. But what's the cause? What's the underlying cause of these problems? >> Well, I think as a species, we have to realize that there is a solution to the problem. I mean, there is a way to stop our suffering. We have to find out what the root of this suffering is, and if we look carefully, we can see that this egoic, I, belief set that we have. It comes from some software that we generated for ourselves 35,000 years ago that was very useful at the time. Now, it's not working. People from chimpanzees 6 million years ago. We went through 6 million years minus 75,000 years, and we were just like-- there were four other species like us running around, very, very competitive. And so we said, what we got to do? Somehow, we developed this way of saying, OK, symbolic logic. I can represent this by drawing that. I can point to this, and you'll know, Oh, that's this thing. That may sound simple, but that's a big deal because then there's a you, a subject, and an object out here that you can refer to, and we can begin talking about other things in complicated ways. And so what happened 75,000 years ago, we developed this subject-doing-object relationship with this symbolic language. Once we did, then we had this I The I's in there, planted. The I is right there, and the I's involved in everything that goes on, common across our species. Once we learned how to do that, we kicked ass. I mean, the other four species, gone. And we shouldn't have won. There were bigger, stronger, bigger-brained species. They should have beat us. They didn't. We wiped them off the surface-- But at the same time, we eventually came out of that. And we said, we really are going to control the package and we did. With that knowledge, that symbolic logic, and the structures, the I structure, this piece of software-- that's all it, a piece of software-- we wiped up the planet, for good or bad. And that now is our problem. We've got this egoic structure, and you can see it everywhere you look. There's a big ego sitting there. And this ego is what's running the process and screwing everything up. >> We've lost ourselves in objective experience. We have allowed ourselves to become immersed in and therefore, apparently limited by our objective experience to the extent that that's what we think we are. We think I am this bundle of thoughts, images, feelings, memories, activities, relationships. Now, most people are so involved in their experience that they don't notice. They overlook or forget their essential self, and this overlooking of ourselves, this is the ignoring of the essential element of our experience. What is there for him to do to stop trying to put an end to his suffering by seeking to change his activities, relationships, et cetera, but to investigate who he truly is. And to begin with, that will require some exploration. [CHANTING] >> The root causes of suffering can be described in many ways. And different spiritual traditions may describe it differently, but certainly, the sense of the ego self is definitely-- you could call that basic ignorance where we've created this notion, this sense of self, this sense of I, very deeply conditioned, really deeply habituated. But it's really a construct. [CHANTING] And of course, the meditative process is to see that this very notion is illusory, that there's a conventional meaning to the sense of self and I, and it has a use, but it also has a danger because as long as there's that view, then what is it that we do around this sense of self? We try to gratify it. We defend it. We aggrandize it. We judge it. We do all kinds of things. But meditation takes us to a deeper level where we say, OK, what is it that we're actually calling self? And when we look deeper, we see the constituent elements that go in. And this is just helpful because then we're not so attached to this idea, to this concept, of self. The more we can let go of the self-centeredness which is just what ego means-- there is a self-center that we gravitate around-- when we see through that, then the natural expression of that insight is compassion, is connection, is love. >> I had a dad who is very strong. Nothing's good enough. You have to keep going. You have to score more goals, hit more home runs, better, better, better. Somehow, it was a beautiful thing because I became successful financially and materially and accomplished these things, but I feel like somehow, where I'm being drawn to is the complete opposite. >> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. >> This ego part of myself is so strong and so powerful. It's been just fed for the last 34 years of my life. It's being fed and fed and fed and fed, just getting stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger, telling me that I need this. I need that. I need this. I need that. And it was really overwhelming to see like, shit, this is causing so much stress in my life because I'm allowing myself to get caught up in this race of how can I get more stuff. What I would really like to hear for myself and understand is like the suffering part. I suffer, to be honest. I do-- I don't know if it's daily or weekly. It just varies. It's not on a schedule or something, but I do have anxiety. I do feel fear. I do feel like sometimes, my mind is just controlling my life. >> Out of control, totally. >> What can I do really to be free from that? >> We say we can look at self-inquiry. Mata Maharshi, probably the sage of the 20th century, said, just look for the I just to ask, who am I, over and over and over and over again. Western philosophy, only one or two people ever even looked at the possibility of questioning the I. Eastern folks did it. Where am I? >> During like-- meditate and just on that "make that my mantra" kind of thing? Who am I? >> No, not a mantra though, not a mantra. What we're trying to do is get really curious. >> Is it simple enough to say like, if we don't want to feel suffering, to just don't do things that make us suffer. >> But even more fundamental than that is saying, OK, let's just deconstruct the sufferer. If we don't have the sufferer, there is no suffering. There are an infinite number of pleasures and possibilities and desires and thoughts, but there's only one I, because it's there in every thought, every desire. Every lack, there's an I there. And if you just keep going after that I, don't get sucked into stories. Just keep coming back into, what is this I? Where is this I? When I ask, where is James? Oh, James is sitting here. No, well, really where is James though? Well, James is someplace in here. No, he's not though. And you keep watching, keep asking, now, where is James? And you find out that in fact, James isn't a real thing. Every time, James will meet somebody, a different person-- you talk to Mark, or if you talk to Anna, there's a different James who shows up for those two situations. You watch carefully, you can see there are two different Jameses there. And if you watch yourself in the course of day, you can see lots of Jameses. What's the deal here? How important can James be if he's got whole pack of them? Which one do we believe is real? If you put yourself in the scanner, you can look at your brain. You can say, hold it, we can't find James anyplace. We can find lots of Jameses, but James is just an ad hoc entity created as waves of energy sweep across the cortex. Scientifically, we can show you there is no James there. >> So according to all that stuff, who is James? Who am I? >> Well, that's the question. You're only now, now, now. You aren't becoming now. You're only now. There is no past. There's only this very moment. Not I will be present now. No, you are only there. Only beingness. There's no one being. There's just beingness. [TRANQUIL MUSIC] >> It's difficult not to evaluate the experience almost aesthetically, if you know what I mean. Not to think of-- even having the idea of a good meditation here. They're always telling you, oh, there's no such thing as good meditation. Ah, maybe. So I know what I want. I want cessation of self. I want, ah, bliss. There was nothingness for a while because on some level, we know I've put this thing together. It's not really who I am. You stare too long in a mirror, you freak yourself out whether you're on acid or not. It gets to a point where you think, who's looking back at me now? Who is that? Where is the distinction? >> This is the process of self-inquiry. I would start by asking, tell me about yourself and chances are the person would start with something like, I'm a schoolteacher, and straightaway, I would say, no, you haven't always been a school teacher, and you probably won't always be a school teacher. So I want to know about yourself. Can you tell me about yourself? So then the person might say, well, I'm 34 years old. Again, I would comment, but you haven't always been 34 years. You were still yourself when you were 13 years old. So yourself cannot have any particular age. So I'm presuming, of course, that, that person understands. It's very easy to understand. Nothing extraordinary, nothing mystical, nothing spiritual. Just inviting the person to go deeper and deeper into their sense of themselves, a sense of their being what they've called, I, all their life. The person may then refer to some bodily sensation. Again, I would point out that our bodily sensations change innumerable times throughout the day, let alone throughout our lives. So no actual experience of the body is inherent to begin with. They would describe thoughts, feelings, and activities, but as the conversation went on, there would be longer and longer periods of silence as they tried to find something in their own experience which they could say, this is with me when I'm dreaming. It's with me when I'm deeply asleep. It's with me whatever I'm feeling. It's with me at whatever age I've been, in whatever circumstance I find myself. So they would begin to struggle to put a name to that. What is it in our experience that qualifies as I? Obviously, no thought, no feeling, no bodily sensation, no activity, no relationship, qualifies as I because these are continually leaving us and reappearing and leaving us. So the self-inquiry begins with this tracing back of the attention. I'm not my thoughts. I am that which is aware of my thoughts. I'm not my feelings. I am that which is aware of my feelings. We trace our way back until we get simply to that which I am. The only element that remains with us all the time is our essential being or our essential self-aware being, and at some point, there is this recognition, I am pure awareness. That's just the recognition of our true nature. And we've lost touch in most cases with our essential self which is not a thought or a feeling, an activity, or relationship, and is above all, inherently peaceful and unconditionally fulfilled. In other words, it is the place in us of peace and happiness. But most of us have overlooked that or forgotten it in favor of the objective content of our experience. >> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. >> So is suffering kind of an illusion? >> Yes. Very good, very good, very good. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. It's not real. >> But it feels so real. It feels real. It's a tricky-- >> Yes, yes. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. >> So by cultivating silence and self-investigation, those are the ways to disconnect from the mind? Are those the ways to bypass the mind, to disidentify with the mind? >> Yes. [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. [CHANTING] >> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. >> I was just in India not too long ago, and I was studying with an amazing kind of guru, spiritual teacher, and we were having an incredible chat. And at one point during the talk, I realized with suffering and this I, or the ego, and separation, it kind of was understood by me that it's an illusion. But I understood it on one level, but when I'm having an anxiety attack or I'm-- >> Not enough. >> It's like, this doesn't feel like an illusion to me. I can't breathe. If this is fake-- So I feel still a little bit confused about it. >> If James has bad thoughts, problematic anxiety, fear, traumatic thoughts, then that's one kind of a thought. You can feel the difference. You can feel that one, and you can feel, I think we should shoot this afternoon or this morning or tomorrow. That's a different thought from, oh my god, this is a horrible fiasco. This is a terrible thing. My business is failing. Those feel differently. >> So are those thoughts the suffering? The ones that cause the problems? Is that-- >> That's it. >> --maybe your definition of suffering? >> That's it. If these kind of thoughts are quiet, and most people, 99% of their thoughts are these kind of thoughts, the bad thoughts, and so if you can quiet those down, you gain a huge amount of bandwidth. The whole thing is-- now, this thing is quiet in here. There's just nothing going on. It's just quiet. >> And do you feel like you still suffer from those things at all-- anxiety, fear, separation, all the things that you're talking about? >> No. >> So you don't feel like you suffer at all in life? Do you know how you did it or--? >> I went into self-inquiry, inquiring who you are and what you are, and it worked. You watch your thoughts. You could watch your thoughts. You could see all that taking place. They all had an I in them. Part of this stuff that I do, this practice, is getting rid of your attachments because the attachments really generate the I. They work together. I want this green tea. I have to have the green tea. If I don't, oh my gosh, it got terrible. So you just deconstruct all those attachments. And so that drives you forward because as you start to take apart James, you find a lot of resistance. So a lot of James' stories about this and that, a lot of old memories, a lot of old traumas, and there's ways to push through those, to look at them and say, where's the James in this one? You look at your attachments and what's attachment to that. There's a James there attached to the car or the reputation or the story or whatever, and you say, well, those are all parts of James. You can break all those down, but you've got to decide, hey, this is serious. I can't just buy another car, get another girlfriend, get more drugs, rock and roll. I've got to somehow fix this thing. I'm responsible for this mess. Everyone has to feel that. And change. If they don't change, the ship sinks. Titanic goes down. >> How do we fix it? >> If you first begin to recognize, look, I don't need to suffer. I said, fuck it. Pardon my French, fuck it. I don't want to suffer anymore. I'm done suffering. This has to stop. Do you need to suffer? >> No. >> OK. Because that's an important part. When you get to that point, then you'll do anything to get free. But it needs to get there. >> I think I'm at that point. >> How much are you willing to surrender? Accept, let go, are words we use, but we don't like to use the word, surrender. But to me, it came down to when I totally surrendered. I was totally held, totally, completely. I have no sense of doing anything. >> You don't have to understand it right now. That will come later. It's OK. >> I feel it a lot right now, and my face, it's like really tingling. >> Yeah. Yeah. It may not be the ideal situation to do this in. Don't do it if it's not right for you, but see if you can allow yourself to make some sound. >> [BREATHES OUT]. >> Yeah, that's it. It's difficult but try not to control it. Yeah, try and let the sound out as much as you can. And then tell me a little bit. >> It's something new for me. We didn't learn about this stuff growing up. They don't teach this stuff at school. This isn't what they taught us at church and all that. Its a different thing. I met a couple of people on this trip in India, a teacher, a guy in New York, and they said, by learning these things, learning how to be more present and stuff like that, they actually don't get angry, ever. They're not making bad decisions. >> That's a process. You're not born that way. >> No, definitely. Well, maybe we are born that way, and then stuff happens in our life which changes us. I don't think we're born as little assholes. >> Well, it's learned behavior. You learn how to be an asshole and then you learn, you unlearn, whatever. >> Yeah, it was definitely interesting, that's for sure. I went to Peru also. You want to know what I did in Peru? >> No, tell me. There's monks and everything else, right? >> No, in Peru, there's no monks. Those are shamans. We drank-- we went one month in the jungle in Peru, and there's this stuff called ayahuasca. Have you ever heard of that? >> No. >> They take this vine that grows above ground like a vine, and they take a leaf from another plant, and there's priests. Then at night, you sit in a room with 12 people-- >> And you drink it? >> And you drink it. >> It was you. They watch you. >> No, 12-- everybody drinks it. >> Yeah, yeah, they're experimenting on you. >> No, no, they weren't experimenting on me. It was crazy, but I started to have that panic attack before I drank it. I was like crying and shaking. I didn't even drink this stuff yet. And I drank it. >> I wouldn't have drank it. I would have faked it. I would have been like, yeah-- I wouldn't have drank it at all. >> Yeah, but I felt like I was fighting this thing, and then the fourth time I did it-- we were there for like a month, and I did it 5 times-- >> You drank the juice five times? >> Yeah. But the fourth time, I figured out that I was like fighting this thing-- they call it a medicine-- they're like doctors actually, and this is like a natural medicine that God told them about. That's what they say. But some people leave with no depression or anxiety, or some people are suicidal, and they go, and it helps them. It fixes-- it can help people fix their problems, and for me, I felt it really helped because I felt like a lot of the anxiety I had because I feel I try to control stuff to always be in control of everything in my life, and with that kind of stuff, you can't be in control. So it's hard because you start freaking out at the beginning because your body and your mind and all that stuff, you just can't do anything. You're totally out of control. >> You're lucky you didn't piss yourself in front of all those people. >> I was hearing all this stuff from these teachers and these gurus and people that I saw about how suffering is an illusion and that it doesn't really exist, but I was still feeling suffering. So I really wanted to take ayahuasca and work with that medicine to see if I could access that place in myself where the suffering didn't exist anymore. >> When you start to analyze your life, you start to question what is the nature of reality, what is the nature of truth, and it seems that there is more than one answer to that question. This isn't all reality, then who is it behind the eyes? When I think to myself, who's I and who's myself? How can I have a simultaneous subjective objective experience in my own consciousness? Who's talking in there and who's listening? There's at least two people in every single human mind. >> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. >> Coming to the surface of all the shadows and all the lies and getting back to a sense of what is the truth and how can we know it, maybe there's something more than the game show reality. I'm being sold, and they discover it. And when they do, then they're sort of perplexed because they're not seeing it on the cover of the New York Times, but it's the most important thing that's ever happened to them. >> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. >> Ayahuasca is an amazing medicine that been known about for centuries and brewed in the Amazon by the combining of two elements. What it is, is you have the vine and then you have the leaf, so the combination of the vine and the leaf in a tea allows the DMT to become orally active. DMT is one of the most powerful psychoactive agents ever discovered, and it happens to be a naturally-occurring neurotransmitter in everyone. >> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. >> It's helpful to understand that this is a pathway. This is not just a medicine that we can drink or ingest that's just going to fix our problems. In so many ways, we have become dismembered, disconnected, dislocated, dislodged, as a result of trauma, so now, we see in the West that our medical system is not able to address the root causes of the chronic issues that we face typically on the physchoemotional level. So the epidemic of depression, anxiety, stress that we see in the modern world is not being addressed by our medical system. Ayahuasca and the tradition that surrounds ayahuasca does offer us an opportunity to really address the root causes of stress, depression, and anxiety fundamentally by clearing the barriers, the blockages, the difficulties, the traumas that we've been through and accumulated over our life to purge them out, to cleanse them. When we cleanse them, we then find ourselves being able to live in a much more authentic way, feeling a sense of presence, feeling a sense of coherence, of flow, and connection in our life. So ayahuasca, in a nutshell, is really helping us to remember who we are. We forget who we are because we get too trapped in the conditions and patterns and programs that have been laid in, often in our childhood, that take us away from presence and authenticity. >> Nobody should be going into this sacred experience with a view to recreation. This is not what it's about. It's not about that at all. It's about deep, often very troubling, personal work. If you're prepared to do that work, it can be transformatory. What ayahuasca is going to show you is the plain, unvarnished truth about yourself and the impact, either positive or negative or a bit of both, that you have in the world. You're going to get that message loud and clear, sooner or later, maybe not your first session, maybe not your 10th, but sooner or later, it is going to hit you like a rocket. >> When you have a really powerful ayahuasca experience, it's like the rapids that you're going down in your imagination. One dimension after another is coming at you, and it's just overwhelming. There's no way that you can control it. And so the best is to surrender to it and to orient toward your most deep center of your soul. >> When you open that door to the realm beyond the material realm, you're opening it to everything that's in there. >> Whatever comes up, just let it come. It's OK. That's it. I'm going to go out on a limb here. I'm guessing there's a little bit of control going on there. Does not make any sense? >> Yeah, I can feel it. >> Sorry, what? >> Yeah. >> Yes. OK. What happens when I say that, James? >> I feel more emotions come up. >> OK, just let them be there. Just allow them space. It's safe to feel your heart. See, I may not be right, but I have a slight feeling that there's something that wants to put that screen to sleep, shut it up, not be so noisy. Does that make sense? >> Yeah. I also feel like this physical-- >> Yeah, a lot of-- >> --this shaky-- like I can shake away this. That it actually feels good to shake away the-- like let it out. >> Yeah, do a bit more of that and see if you can make some sound with it. Argh. Aargh. >> [GRUNTS]. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] >> [GRUNTS LOUDLY]. >> Yeah, that's great. [NON-ENGLISH SINGING]. >> [CRIES]. >> Yeah. [DRAMATIC MUSIC] >> Get out of the way. There's something there. There's something there. And if you get out of the way, you feel like it just comes through in a variety of colors and flavors and all manner of permutations. You have to be completely, completely, and absolutely present. You have to fall into it. You have to surrender. I sense that there is just a oneness continually communicating with itself. The infinite is expressing itself through the temporal that between our consciousness, your consciousness and my consciousness, we are one. I don't know, mate. I don't know what we're going to do. Luckily, you don't live that long. And it's good, innit, to just take the piss because none of it's real. This is a little curtain, and you come behind the curtain, you see that it's all silly, go back behind the curtain and worry about death again for a bit. How long is there now? Maximum 50, 60 years, then it's the old boneyard. >> Yes, I was in Peru not too long ago and stayed there for a month in Amazon, deep, and we worked with the Shipibo people. And we did some very intense ayahuasca ceremonies. It was the first time in my life that I ever tried ayahuasca, and yeah, it was a pretty intense place to go for the first round. And the first night, I was kind of mellow, and I didn't really have much of an experience, so the second night, I drank much more. And before I even drank the medicine, I was having crazy anxiety attacks before I even drank it, just pure panic. And then I realized something. I realized I was trying to control something. I was trying to control the medicine, and I wasn't really willing to let go. And I had this thought of like, what the fuck am I doing? I'm here in Peru in the jungle drinking ayahuasca, and I'm trying to control something that can't really be controlled. And then I completely let go. >> Yeah, great insight. >> Everything. And everything changed. I feel like I even let go of life. I remember having a thought of, well, if this is death or I'm dying right now, I'm OK with it, which is something that was huge for me because I always had this fear of dying and felt like I actually did die on some level. >> Wow. >> But it was OK. And I was just like [EXHALES]. >> But you had reached that point of surrendering even your life in that limited form to the great flow, and that is beyond your control, letting die the controller and getting in touch with the great controller. >> But I still do suffer in my life from anxiety. And I feel it coming, and then I do the same kind of thing where I start to control, try to control. Oh, what's happening? What's that feeling? What's coming up in me? And I guess, what you just said makes a lot of sense. I have to maybe treat it like I did with the ayahuasca and somehow completely surrender to the feelings that I have instead of trying to control them, maybe. >> Exactly. You were still there after you surrendered, right? You were still there and identifying with that witness that's still there always, no matter what happens on the outside. >> I think first and foremost, we have to concede that we are dealing with a gigantic mystery. What we're here to do, as best as we possibly can in one lifetime or in multiple lifetimes, is to explore that mystery and understand, try to understand, what all this magic is about because surely, it's a magical thing, an enchanted thing to live in this universe, to live on this beautiful planet. Where I see the light is an awakening of consciousness, that people all around the world are waking up to this fundamental fact that we are not our knees, we are not our shoulders, we are not our skulls, we are our consciousness. >> The most transforming effect of this recognition is that it puts us in touch with the place of happiness in ourselves, and it brings an end to the impossible and unfulfillable search for happiness in objective experience. It doesn't even mean to say that we necessarily stopped desiring activities and relationships but we desire them not in order to find happiness in them, we desire them in order to express or celebrate or share the happiness or the peace that we have already felt. >> I've never done psychedelics. I'm still a psychedelic virgin. >> We're going to change that right now. We actually have some LSD in there. >> Everybody I work with has done everything. So I'm the only virgin, but yeah, I just was trying to find some way through. >> So through meditation, through practicing yoga-- I'm just interested to know the different methods that you used to end the suffering. >> But the core of it is just this, how do we deconstruct this I? When you completely surrender, it happens. Like that. >> God, how many people I think are even aware-- >> It is possible. >> --of what this thing is that they could actually have access to. >> That's right. That's right. And everybody's felt it. There's something in our life, everybody's at someplace had a-- oh, wow. It goes away there. It wasn't caused by an orgasm or something that-- just had a little window into some other space. It was like, what is that? And quickly, the brain, conditioned very heavily, plasters it over. Oh, pay no attention to the man behind the screen. I mean, just get it out of the way. But if you recognize, you can have that, that little window that you had, that little, oh wow, what is that? That's real. You can be in this blissful, transcendent, OMG state all the time. You can just be there. Life still goes on. These bodies still have behaviors that they do. But in fact, what's inside is vast stillness. You still pick up coffee and tea, and move it around the table and everything else. But in fact, what's happening inside isn't anything to do with that. The body still does what bodies do. But in fact, you've moved far beyond that. You can see that all of this is a dream. None of this is real. You're in a whole different place. You're not there anymore. I mean, if you're in now, now, now, to really just be there. There is no past, literally. There's no recollection of what took place 10 seconds ago. There's just now and now and now and now. It's a whole different world. >> [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH]. You feel bliss because the bliss pass through you. >> The path, in the sense that I'm on, is trying to figure out how to quiet my mind and not be controlled by thoughts, not let my emotions control me, be who I really am, and not pretend to be somebody else. When we're kids, we have to be a certain way so that our teachers like us, so that our parents are happy with us, so that the society works, you know what I mean? >> Mm-Hmm. >> We can't actually be ourselves. So we pretend to be something else that we think everybody else wants us to be. And just that idea in itself causes us to suffer, and we don't even realize it. It causes us from reaching our full potential, you know what I mean? And from what I learned traveling around the world talking to all these amazing people, smart people, scientists, people every different religion, the way to kind of fix all this stuff is to really just be in the moment, to be present. >> Well, that's the bottom line, I guess. I'm a bottom line type of guy. >> If you'll try it, I'll give you some CDs. You can listen to and see. If you say you're present all the time anyway, it'll be easy for you. Just kick it on-- >> Oh, I'm present when it's important. When it's important, I'm present. >> What's not important? >> Well, I'm here. I'm here visiting with you. That's important for me to be in the moment, right? >> I think, also, I didn't realize how important life is. >> Yeah, yeah. It goes by quick. Yeah, goes by quick, real quick. >> But you said like, being present when things are important. What I'm saying is, what's not important? >> Oh, some things are not important. >> Everything is important. Every minute is like a gift. >> Yeah. You figure it out, carve your little circle out, and do you. What you can never change what other people think or act or feel, that's for sure. >> I don't want to do that. >> I stopped watching the news and reading the newspaper a long time ago because you can't change the news, but the news can change you. Nothing you can do about what's happening on the 8 o'clock news, but I'd better get out of here. They're going to-- >> You want to go to the jazz place later? >> Yeah, yeah, for sure. >> They got some jazz-- >> Jazz out. >> --ginger ale. >> Yeah. Cranberry, bro. >> Cranberry juice. >> I live it up. At night, cranberry and pineapple something. It looks like a drink so you could perpetrate with the pineapple juice. Sometimes, I'd say, give me a umbrella. Yeah. You got to eat, bro. You need a big steak. Stop messing around, eat a big steak, get it over with. >> I'm not going eat a steak. >> I get the vegan thing for a month. >> No, I've been doing it for like eight years. >> Get down with a steak. Big Texas cattleman. >> You tried the vegetarian thing too-- >> Yeah, I know. I know. I was hungry. >> --for a year. You did like a year, right? >> Yeah, year and a half. I'm about to go back though. I got to just get off, just eat chicken for a few weeks, and then get off the chicken. >> Or fish.
