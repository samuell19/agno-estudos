Seriously, Lara Jean? Now is not the time to be fantasizing about living in an '80s movie. Except for today, it's different because it's not a fantasy. This is my real life. Don't I look different to you? Um... No. Yeah, I don't see it. How? Like someone that has a boyfriend would look. You look like he's gonna be here soon and you haven't started getting ready. Have you even showered? Get out. I'm gonna take a shower. People say fairy tales aren't real. But sometimes... ...happily ever after is for real. I've been thinking about this moment since I started reading romance novels. My very first date. How do I look? Perfect. You look fantastic, honey. Okay. Hi. Hey. What's up? - Nothing much. - No?

Wow, they have big menus here. The bigger the menu, the fancier the restaurant. Everybody knows that. It's actually a two-fork restaurant.

That's so embarrassing. - Oh, my God. What's happening? Peter. It's a good thing I have my backup. Uh-huh. This is my first date. I've never been a girlfriend before.

Just... Well, tell that thought to get out of your head! You can't think about us breaking up on our first date. I just don't want us to break each other's hearts. I promise I am not going to break your heart. I promise not to break your heart. Ooh. - Do you love it? - I do. - Look at that! That's awesome. - You have really great handwriting.

Yeah, we do, too. - I'm gonna send you a gazillion pictures. - It's almost time! We gotta go! My girls. Oh, no. Here it comes. Like two beautiful little roses. Is that Margot? Honey, I wish you were here. I do, too. - I love you guys. - Bye. I did it. Yeah, I didn't think you could. Good morning. You guys look great. - Thanks! - Here you go, Doc. Thanks, Jasmine. Wow. Now, don't you feel left out you didn't wear your hanbok? Yes, Mom. Beyond devastated. Thank you. - Want a beer, Dan? - Yeah, why not? So, Dan, are you dating anyone? - Carrie! - It's just a question! That doesn't mean you have to stay single forever. My dad says it's important for us to keep our Korean heritage alive. But I know the real reason we make such a big effort on the holidays is because being around her family makes him feel closer to my mom. So you have a boyfriend? No offense or anything, but I always thought you were a "no dating till college" type girl. His name is Peter, and he wouldn't be dating Lara Jean if it wasn't for me, 'cause he didn't even know she existed, but I mailed a secret love letter that she wrote for him... Well, technically, she wrote five. Anyway, they started fake dating to make his ex-girlfriend jealous, and to cover up her real crush, but everything got weird and they started real dating, and now they're real boyfriend and real girlfriend and they are adorable. Cute story. A little PG-13, but cute. Show Haven a picture of him. Shut up. This is your boyfriend? Yeah, why? Dude, I hate to be the one to tell you this, but I saw a video of him and some girl doing it in a hot tub. Yeah, um... that was me. But it's not what you think. We were just making out. That's... cool, actually. I want some ice cream. You want some? - Sure. - Sure. That's for you. Thanks. When Kitty mailed my love letters, I thought my life was over. For weeks, I prayed John Ambrose's letter had gotten lost in the mail. And when I never heard anything back, I thought the nightmare was over. But, I guess it wasn't. Dear Lara Jean, I couldn't believe when I opened that letter and it was from you. Wow. It's been, what, five years since we've seen each other? Not that I'm mad or anything. I was so happy to get it. I can't believe how mature you were at 11. God, when I was 11, my mom was still putting out snacks for me after school, but here you were with all these complex thoughts and emotions. It's crazy. Reading it reminded me of that time that we both got locked out after school. Remember that? We went to the Robertson's treehouse and read Harry Potter until it got dark. If I'd written you a love letter back then, I'm pretty sure it would've just said something like, um, "I liked reading with you. You're really pretty." But your letter was so much more than that. I just have one question: Why send it now? Whatever the reason, I'm really glad I got to read it. Yours, John Ambrose. Oh, my God. John Ambrose McClaren just wrote me a letter. Wait, does this mean he liked me in sixth grade, too? Does he like me now? Okay. Calm down. It's not a spontaneous love letter or anything. It's more like a thank-you card. There's no need to respond. But... wouldn't it be rude not to respond? It would definitely be inconsiderate, so I respond. But, in a friendly way. Just be, like, polite. Thank him for his letter and move on. Dear John Ambrose, I hope this letter finds you well. Have you continued your interest in politics and diplomacy? I'm sure you're even more smart, considerate, and adorable... What am I saying? I can't say that. Dear John Ambrose, What lovely penmanship you have. When I saw your name on the envelope, my heart skipped a beat, and then I... I am so lame. Dear John Ambrose, First of all, thank you for writing me back. It's nice to be in touch after so long. I do remember that day in the treehouse reading until it was dark. You said you were House Hufflepuff, and that was my house, too, and I thought maybe that was a sign that we were meant to be. Oh, my God. I cannot do this. Do I have to tell Peter about this? ♪ Clovers in my eyes ♪ ♪ The way the light falls On the bus on the way home ♪ All juniors, please report to the cafeteria to choose your spring service commitments.

Do you remember when Kitty sent out my love letters? Is that a serious question? No, of course you remember. But... remember when you asked me who got the other ones, and I said the last one went to someone from Model UN? Mm-hmm. - It was John Ambrose McClaren. - No shit. McClaren? That was my boy. Well, he wrote me back. He wrote you... Like, an actual... Like, an actual letter? Or an email? Or... Yeah, like a real letter in the mail. Huh. He say anything about me? - Like what? - I dunno. Like, "Um, how's Kavinsky? How's he doing?" Nope. Did you write him back? Not yet. Oh, so you're, like... you're, like, going to, planning on it?

Margot volunteered at Belleview. And, besides, Belleview looks better on college applications. I dunno, it was just the guys... We kind of decided that we were gonna do Oakwood when training started. But, um... You should go. I'm gonna sign up for Belleview. - Are you sure - Mm-hmm. Go sign up. Seriously. Okay, well, let me make it up to you. Let's meet after practice for coffee. Five o'clock.

When Peter and I got together, I didn't expect to feel so insecure about his past relationship with Gen. But for every first I was having with him, he'd already had his with her. Sorry, are you using this chair? Yeah. It's for my boyfriend. I'm sorry. You don't need this chair, do you, Lara Jean? I do. Peter's on his way. - He's just running a little behind. - Is he? - Is anybody using this chair? - Yes. My boyfriend, he's coming. Okay, I am so sorry, Covey. I... Coach made us run the bleachers until everyone practically puked. Well, you could've let me know. I would've, but he has that rule. No texting during practice or else you don't start. I need to play every single game, so it's kind of... I'm really sorry. I should've came up with a better plan that didn't leave you hanging. Yeah, you should've. Let's get out of here. What? - Call your dad. - What? Tell him you're gonna be home late. What? Where are we going? I'm taking you out. - Okay. Ah! - Yup. Let's go. - Right now. - Okay, okay, I'm going.

Outdoorsy, morning person, - consistently has good shoe choices. - What are you talking about? Mrs. Rothschild. I think they should date. She's divorced, you know. Happened last year. Right. Because Dad, who hasn't dated in years, is suddenly gonna start dating our neighbor. Sounds a bit delusional, Kitty. You also thought I was delusional when I suggested you date Peter. And, um, how did that one work out? They just need a little shove. Kitty. Leave Dad and Mrs. Rothschild alone. Okay? I mean it. She cut down her hedges, Lara Jean. That is a metaphor! Are you sure? I can just keep Henry outside. Can I get him anything? A rack of ribs? Yes. - I'll get that number. - Good boy. Hi. - Oh, hi. - Hi. Nice to see you, Mrs. Rothschild. Okay. I got Bobby's contact info. Can I text it? Yeah, know what? Why don't I just put my number in your phone? - Oh, okay. - Okay. This guy has got a master green thumb. - He, uh, gave me some tips on hollyhocks. - Hollyhocks are my favorite. - Really? - Yeah. I find them more rewarding than boring azaleas. Exactly. All right. I should probably go. It's nice to see you, Mrs. Rothschild. Oh, Trina. Please. Trina. - Come on. Come on! - Well, I'll walk you out. Ah... okay. Ah! They're gonna be in love by Valentine's Day!

Margot loved Belleview because of the people, but there was one person she talked about way more than any of the others. Hard to beat that! For most people. Ooh! Why that's a Song-Covey if I've ever seen one. You must be Stormy. And you must be Lara Jean. Did your sister send you over here to check up on me? I'm volunteering. Do you know where to find Dorothy? How is Margot enjoying Scotland? I think she really likes St. Andrews. Well, I hope she's not just studying over there. I never had a bad time in Scotland. That was one of my routes for Pan Am. Were you a flight attendant? A flight attendant? That is some PC nonsense. I was a Pan Am stewardess.

This used to be the breakfast room until Hilda over there decided she had a gift. We can hear you, you know? But, didn't you know what we were going to say anyway? Ah, here's Dorothy. This is my very dear friend Lara Jean. She's one of our high school volunteers. - Hello. - Hi. Now, Dorothy, this one is very special. So, I want you to apply the same care to her as you do to your excellent Bloody Mary mix. You make me laugh. Knock 'em dead, honey. Thank you. - Getting a refill. - Make sure you eat your celery! - Oh, yes. - Yeah. She needs her fiber. Oh, no, I don't need that. I have you right here. - Lara Jean Covey. - Yeah. - That's me. - Welcome. - We're just waiting for one more. - Oh. I thought that I was the only one who signed up. From Adler, yes, but we have a young man from Port Smith. His name is... John Ambrose McClaren. Oh! Hi, Lara Jean. Hi... Oh, jeez! Lara Jean! I'll get the first aid kit. Are you okay? Yeah. Follow my finger. - Oh. - Yeah. What are you doing? I'm making sure you're not concussed. How can you tell? I'm gonna ask you some questions. Okay. You know who I am? Someone I sent a love letter to. Yeah, that's the one. And, I'm gonna need that letter back. Why? Oh, you know, I just... I wrote it a long time ago, and I don't necessarily remember what I said, so, I guess I just wanna know how mortified I should be. Okay, okay. I will... I'll bring you the letter on one condition. Okay, you have to return it after you read it. I just, I need proof that someone actually liked me in middle school. Are you kidding? Everyone liked you in middle school. Uh, I don't... I don't really think that's true. You know? But even if it was, I... I didn't really care about everyone. Okay. How's the patient? Uh, she's... she's good. She's embarrassed, but okay. Good. Don't want to get sued again. You ready to get started? Come on. We got it. Nice and easy. Good. Nice and slow. Okay. I bring it to you, you bring it back to me. Those are my terms. Take 'em or leave 'em. - Deal. - Okay. - Ready. - Ready. I thought having a boyfriend meant the mere idea of other boys left your mind completely. And yet, here I was, totally crazy about Peter, but... I couldn't stop replaying my conversation with John Ambrose in my head. I didn't care about everyone. I didn't want to be thinking about what might have been if he'd gotten that letter in middle school instead of now. But I was. So, I have a question. When you wrote those letters... who'd you like the most? You had to have had a favorite. You couldn't have liked us all the same. One of the letters had to have been a little more intense than the others. If I was really being honest, there was one letter that I remember being a little more intense than the others. It was mine. Right? It was me. Right? ♪ Won't you please let me go ♪ ♪ These words lie inside And they hurt me so ♪ ♪ And I'm not the kind That likes to tell you ♪ ♪ Just what you want me to ♪ ♪ And you're not the kind That needs to tell me ♪ ♪ About the birds and the bees ♪ Are you sure you don't wanna add some glitter?

Well, good thing this one only has to make it across the street. Aw. You're giving Trina a valentine? Well, not from me. From Dad. Did you already forget our conversation about meddling? Besides, Dad's not a glitter type of guy. Nor were you a Peter Kavinsky kinda girl till I sprinkled some glitter on it. Oh, uh-huh, mmm, walk away. Go get your turnovers!

And stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes of beautiful Lara Jean." Do you like it? Oh, my God. No one has ever written me a poem before. Like, seriously, this is the most romantic thing ever. I... Hey, Chris? Why are we in woodshop for our Valentine's Subway tradition? Woodshop is the only place on campus I can stomach today. - Mmm. - I get ear bleeds from a cappella. Did Kavinsky sic them on you? Ah, no, he got me something better. Nice! Boy's got game. And, I got you a little V-Day gift of my own. - Oh, Chris, that's so sweet... - It's advice. Okay. Before you go too far with Kavinsky, make sure you are 100 percent... - No, 1000 percent sure... - That it's something that I want. I know. - Trust me, I'm not... - Actually, I was gonna say something else. I am trying to make sure you know how to rev your own engine before you let anyone under the hood. Chris, we all know you can't wink. It's okay. I'm just saying! Make sure you know how to look after you! Yeah, okay, I get it. I get it, thank you. Hey. Mm-hmm. Are you sure there's no other reason why you wanted to eat in the woodshop today? We both like the smell of sawdust and that is not a crime. I'm gonna go. I think this is yours. Thanks. Oh, my God. Shut up. - Oh! John Ambrose, good to see you again! - Hi, Mrs. Glick. Oh, hi, John. Today's gonna be a fun day. I have an exciting project for you two. Our annual Belleview garden party is coming up. Last year we got rained out, so we decided to move it indoors. So we're gonna do the garden party in here? Yup! Put out some potted ferns, cheese platter. I dunno, some twinkle lights? It'll be fine. But, I need you two to clear out this space. - It's become a bit of a junk room. - Wow. What is this? Mr. Sawoski's failed green thumb attempt and belongings of residents who passed. Alone. With no family members to claim them. Make two piles, okay? Trash and donations. When I heard "garden party," I imagined art deco elegance. Not a couple potted plants and a cheese plate. Yeah. Yeah, it's kind of depressing. Yeah. Look at this. Oh. Old love letters from someone stationed in Italy. He sent her his photo with a note on the back. "My darling Linda..." Oh, this seems personal. I feel a little funny reading this. Wanna read this instead? Remember, it's only a loan. That it is. Mm. Okay... "Dear John Ambrose, do you remember the Halloween party at Matt Kaplan's barn? I planned my costume for weeks. I was so excited. I didn't tell anyone what I was gonna be. And then, I got there. It's like everyone except me got the cool kid memo that no one really dresses up for Halloween anymore. I felt so lame. Like I didn't fit in. And then, you walked in as a deviled egg. And I realized... maybe I'm lame in a cool way. And that's when I knew. I knew it all the way down to my candy red sneakers. I love you, John Ambrose. I really love you. Why, oh, why do you have to move away? Maybe someday we'll meet again, and you'll never know I felt any of this. But, I'll know. I'll always know that once upon a time, my heart was yours." I cannot believe I wrote that. I cannot believe he read that. I cannot believe he's downstairs knowing I just read what he read that I wrote. Lara Jean, are you okay? I don't know. Come into my room. No woman should be out in public with that look on her face. "Maybe one day, we'll meet again. I'll always know that once upon a time, my heart was yours. Love, Lara Jean." Why? Why did I write these stupid love letters? I think it's exciting. You predicted that you'd meet again. And here you are. I have a boyfriend. So? Almost every one of my love affairs overlapped with another one. Well, this is different. Peter and I promised not to break each other's hearts. Oh, honey, you're always breaking someone's heart, or they're breaking yours. Well, isn't there a way to both get out unscathed? Not if you're doing it right. I think it's time we both had a drink. Stormy. I'm 16. Suit yourself. More for me. I'll just get you some soda. When I was young, the drinking age was 18, and you're not far from that. That's about when I met my first husband. How did you meet? Oh, he was our neighbor. And he was a songwriter. And I can remember sitting around our living room, listening to him sing. And then one day, I discovered that the song was about me. If a man ever writes you a song, then you know for sure that he's got it bad. What about a poem? Well, yeah. Sure. Same thing. A poem is just a song without the music part. For Valentine's Day, Peter wrote me the most beautiful poem. I bet you know it, too. "The moon never beams without bringing me dreams of beautiful Lara Jean. And the stars never rise..." "But I feel the bright eyes of beautiful Annabel Lee." Uh, how did you... Your young man has very good taste. I'll give him that. But I'm sorry to tell you that the author of that particular poem is Edgar Allen Poe. You want to rethink that drink option? Go! Ah! Oh, wait, come on. What was that? - Let's go, I ain't stopping! - Let's take one for Insta. Hi, Mom. Now one for the real Insta. Whipped wonderworld. The secret ingredient is... - Whipped cream? - That's why it's the... Yeah, I think you should... - What? - Yeah. Okay... Anywho, last ice cream sandwich. You wanna split it? Thanks. Dude! Every time! - Not into flip cup, huh? - Like, ever. Don't hate the player. Hate the game. I just said I hate the game. Okay. Spill it. I just need a break. From the contortions of being someone's girlfriend. Oh, no, what is he doing to you? No, it's not like that. It's, like, mentally. - All right. Go on. - It's like this. We're here and we're sharing an ice cream sandwich. And it's great. But if Peter was here and we were sharing an ice cream sandwich, I don't know, I'd be thinking about... has Peter shared an ice cream sandwich with someone before? And if he has, was it with Gen? Does he think that I'm a prude if I just wanna share an ice cream sandwich? Maybe it's me. Maybe I'm the one who wants to do more than just share an ice cream sandwich. So the answer to all of those questions... is... is I don't know. Is this what happens in a girl's mind? - That's what goes on in this girl's mind. - Well, I am glad I am not you. And not your ice cream. So, back up. - Hey, Lucas? - Mm-hmm. - Do you remember John Ambrose McClaren? - Yeah. Of course. I was like obsessed with him in the fifth grade. Well, him and Michael B. Jordan in Creed. I was obsessed with him in sixth grade. He's volunteering at Belleview with me. Not that it means anything. I'm perfectly happy in my relationship with Peter. It's just like the stuff that I was telling you about, like the overthinking, that doesn't happen when I'm with John Ambrose. It's, like, easy. But that's probably because we're just friends, right? You're lucky, LJ. - Lucky how? - You have options. There's like, what, two gay dudes at our school? I'm sorry. I've been thinking about my own problems and not even... thinking about what you're going through. Ah, come on! Listen, sooner than we think, we're gonna be out of high school and we're gonna be in the real world, and guys are gonna be lining up for you. And what makes you so sure? 'Cause before I knew you were gay, I was first in line. Well, that was one hell of a speech just to get another bite. Wait, hold up. Are you guys texting each other when he's just 20 feet away? Hey. Wanna go? Okay. Bye, Lucas. Mm-hmm. Good night, you two. Yes, yes! - I didn't know you were friends. - No. - Nothing to see here. - Mm-mm. - Leave. - Bye, LJ. Hey. You okay? Just, you were a little quiet tonight. Can I ask you something? Yeah. Of course. It's about the... the poem you wrote me. I never said that I... wrote... wrote it. I'm sorry. Look, you were so happy when I read it to you, that I... I mean, I wished that I had written it, and that I could actually write something like that for you. I... But you're the writer. Are you mad? No. I love it. That's good because even if I didn't write it, it's still how I feel about you. Beautiful Lara Jean. Wow. He's really good at this. How is he so good at this? And how does he know how to do that so easily? How do you think? You know what else he's really good at? Uh, I don't wanna have sex with you right now. Oh. That's all right. I... I wasn't... I wasn't trying to have sex with you right now. - I just... I want to put it out there. - Okay. Just in case... Give me some credit, Covey. I don't want to rush you. Especially not in a parked car in front of your house. Did you feel like I'm rushing you? No. Uh... it's just... Remember that story about me and Peter upstairs at last year's graduation party? No, it's just... You and Gen used to do it a lot, right? Can we... can we not... talk about Gen? Oh, it's not about Gen, it's, um... Do you miss sex? Is there a void in your life? Is there a void? No. No. No, not... not at all. Okay, think of it like this. Um... You've been base jumping before. And I've never, I've never been base jumping, so obviously, I would ask you about it in case it's something that I would ever want to... do. I promise if you ever decide to go base jumping that I would love to go with you. It's just a... It's a big decision... to jump off a cliff, so... remember that. Yes. Okay. I'm gonna walk you to your door. - Okay. - Okay. Okay, are we all comfortable? Everyone good? - Yup, - All right. We have a very big prize this week. It is a wheel of aged gouda donated by Mrs. Glick's son. Thank you so much. Draw already! Okay. All right. First number is... B-4. Don't think I've forgotten you haven't returned my letter. O-62. John Ambrose, you're not getting that back. Too embarrassing. B-11. You want embarrassing? Try navigating sixth grade Shakespeare with a stutter. I don't remember that. N-32. G-48. Fine. But even with a mild stutter, you were still a hot commodity. At sleepovers, girls used to say, "Are you Team Peter or Team John?" G-60! Yeah, that's just the thing. Girls pretended to like me because I was friends with Peter. I-24. You remember the sixth grade graduation dance? I couldn't believe when Sabrina Fox asked me to go with her. Couldn't believe it. But then she tried to dance with Peter the whole night. Even during the slow songs, when I couldn't pretend like we were just dancing in a group. Hey! Cut the chitchat. Call the numbers. I-25. I can't wait to be at an age where I'm not expected to think that flip cup is fun. Yeah, I mean, why do you think we're both volunteering and hanging out with the senior citizens on a Saturday? N-40. Are we lame? We might be a little bit. I-30. But, lame in a cool way. Totally lame in a cool way. - Yeah. - Are you kidding? B-2? Whoo! I got BINGO. Suck it. Oh, my God. So, um, speaking of Peter Kavinsky, he told me to tell you he says hi. Oh, cool. You guys still hang out. We do, actually. Is he... is he still like he was in middle school? What does that mean? I mean like, okay, at parties and stuff, he would always take the last slice of pizza. And then whenever you tried to call him out on it, he'd be like, "I'm an athlete." And that one time, it was my birthday and you made me those amazing peanut butter chocolate cupcakes, remember those? - Mm-hmm. - So good. And he took the last one of those, too. But we never even got mad at him, 'cause he's so... Peter Kavinsky, you know? Yeah. I do know. Um... - And... - Are he and Gen still together? - Huh? - I mean, they must be, since you all still hang out. No, actually Gen and I aren't really friends anymore and she and Peter broke up. Huh. That makes sense. No one really stays together in high school, anyway. Right. And on that note, - I think I should tell you... - Oh! What a wonderful team you make. But this is wrong. All of the bingo stuff goes in the basement. This needs to be cleared out for the garden party. I have to go make some prune daiquiris. - Hey, Dorothy! - Dorothy? Did you know there's a basement? Whoa. Oh, my gosh. Oh, there's a bust of Mozart over here. I love his new album. Hey. Look. Forget the stupid garden party and the potted ferns. Like... I think we should give the people what they want. An excuse to dress up and dance like they used to. Yeah? I think we should bring back the Star Ball. I think it's crazy that people think all old people wanna do is play bingo. Yeah, totally. I think it's a great idea. - Cool. - Although... to be fair, I do think that old people just really love bingo for some reason. Yeah. - Do you know what all this reminds me of? - Hmm? Uh, the time capsule. Do you remember when we buried it? Uh, yeah, it was during one of our pizza parties at the treehouse. The pizza parties... Man, we had such good times at that treehouse. Just hanging, you know? Reading. There's something I need to tell you. What's up? Um... they are tearing the treehouse down. Why? The Robertsons are moving out and the new couple, they don't have kids, so... The time capsule. We should dig it up. And rob future generations of the discovery? Future generations are gonna have their hands full with deforestation. Urban overcrowding. And we'll probably be living underwater at that point, right? But it could be fun for us. What do you think? Yeah, um, that's a great idea. And we can invite the other people that were there when we buried it. Yeah. Yeah, totally. We'll... We can invite everybody. It'd be great. I'll bring the pizza. Maybe you can make those peanut butter chocolate cupcakes? What makes the octopus's pulmonary system unique is it has not one, but three hearts. Make an incision underneath the ocellus and you will see the branchial heart. The octopus is a mollusk and we will get to see one of those during next week's visit to the Portland Aquarium. - Mm-mmm. - Okay, here. I got this. So what are you doing this Friday? Are you free? Uh, I'm not sure. Um, why? Do you remember the time capsule that we buried in middle school? - Mm-hmm. - We should dig it up. Just us? Uh, no, the other people that... that we buried it with. - So, Gen? - No. I'm not inviting Gen. She posted that video of us. Well, we don't know for sure that she did that anyway, right? Well, I don't even think she'd come even if we invited her, so... It would be me, you, Chris, Trevor, and John Ambrose. So you... you, um. wrote him back. Funny story, um... we're actually volunteering at Belleview together. - No way. - Yeah. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Did you ask him to volunteer with you? - No, I didn't even write him back. - Huh. Jeez, Covey, for a girl who's never had a boyfriend, you sure know how to mess with a guy. Excuse me? Time capsule. Yeah, let's do it, what the hell? We don't know what we'll find, right? Cool. Watch. - No, no. - Watch it. - Please, I... - Watch it. Jesus... Chocolate peanut butter cupcakes? Peter prefers salted caramel. Lara Jean. Hey. Two pepperoni pizzas! That's probably enough, right? Well, well, well, if it isn't Johnny McClaren! Peter Kavinsky. Hey, man. - Good to see you. - Good to see you. - How you doing? - Good, you get pizzas? - What kind? - Yeah, pepperoni, just two pepperoni. It's the safest. I didn't realize until I saw them standing next to one another what a spectacularly bad idea this was. Yo! You guys ordered 'za? God, I am so hungry! - John! - Yeah. - You made it. - Yeah. Dude, I can't believe you made it, man. It's been so long! Yeah, well, I mean, LJ and I planned the thing, so... - Glad you could come. - Now we're just waiting for Chris. So I guess my invitation got lost in the mail? Oh, my God. It's Gen and Peter! Just like old times. We doin' this or... or what? Why are you, uh, comin' from the river? I just buried a dead body. Yeah, you're next! Whoa, okay, calm down, Chris. - Let me take this. You got it. - Oh, thank you. My shovel. I don't trust you with this thing. - Remember where we buried this thing? - Um, you need some help? No, we're good, dude. Thank you. It's about here, yeah? That's not how you eat a cupcake. No, look at that! She ate it from the bottom up. You know what? She's saving the best for last! That's the way to do it. It just felt right. Hey. Why didn't you ask me to bring the pizza? All right, let's bust this bad boy open! Starting with yours truly. La, la, la... Oh. - Who put this in? - I did. It's just a bracelet. It's not just a bracelet, I mean, that piece of string was the most valuable thing in your life. I guess. Baseball. - I am guessing you put that in. - Yeah, that was me. This is when I hit a home run at Claremont Park. Wait, I remember that! You came running off the field and then you kissed me in front of your mom. Remember that? Uh, no. No, I don't remember that. All right. Yep, that's mine. Ah, yes, the Linkin Park concert at the Crystal Ballroom. - Linkin Park? Nerd. - What? Linkin Park slaps. Oof. Hey, McClaren, remember this? This is when you hopped on the bandwagon, - and wore this hat every single day. - Oh, my God. Wait, Lara Jean, didn't you get a Seahawks T-shirt 'cause you were trying to impress John? Uh, no. If that's true, that's really cute. Hey, uh, McClaren, remember when you had that stutter? No... I just, I noticed you don't have it anymore. Yeah, well, dude, thank you. Appreciate it. I'm sure that my speech therapist would love to know that her methods were successful. It's all good. This is to future Chris. Well, that's me. Whoa. Ha! Genius then... genius now. Uh... I don't know about that. I think a genius would know the time value of money. You know how like a 20 dollar bill now is actually worth less than it was six years ago. - You really got me. - I know. Mm-hmm. You're the last one left. What's inside? Um, well, it's empty. Impossible. You put something in there. We all did. Well, I don't really know what to tell you because there's nothing in there. Uh, does anyone want the last slice? Too slow. - What? - It's getting too crowded in here. - Same. - Yeah, I'm out. I can stick around and help you clean up if you want. - I got it. - Oh, dude, it's cool. I mean, I kinda helped make the mess. But it's fine, I don't mind... No, man. I think I can handle helping my girlfriend clean up. Thank you, though. I'll go down. You wanna hand me stuff? Okay. I'll see you tomorrow. Sure. Why didn't you tell McClaren that you and I are together? Well, I wanted to. I tried to. There just was never a good time. Yeah, there's usually not, when you're flirting. Well, we weren't flirting. So... Well, next time you need pizza, just ask me. I'll get it for you. What is it with you and pizza? It's not about pizza. If he brings the pizza then it looks like you two threw the party. It sort of was. You can't do that, Lara Jean. Not when you have a boyfriend. Doesn't look right. Oh, right. So, like, inviting your ex-girlfriend to your current girlfriend's party. I did not invite her! Like, officially. I... - I might've mentioned it. - Oh, yeah? When? I don't know. Why does it matter? You're the one who arranged the pizza. - Okay, we're going around in circles. - Well, it's not supposed to be like this. - Then, how's it supposed to be? - I don't know. Not like this though. Does that mean you wanna break up? Wait, what? No! Why would you say that? I don't know. Is that why you didn't tell John about us? So you'd keep your options open? No! That's not the reason at all. Okay, fine! Ever since we started dating for real, I don't know how to act. I didn't read the girlfriend's handbook. Girlfriend's handbook? Uh... what does that mean? Like, little stuff. Like I remember Gen used to dress up for your games. - Am I supposed to do that? - It's not just Gen. Okay, all the girlfriends do that. Okay, so, do you want me to? I mean, no, not if you don't want to. It would be nice, it would show that you care. Oh, like sending a serenade to someone on Valentine's Day, maybe? I... I didn't think that was your style. I mean... Well, it's not my style. Okay, so... Let's never fight again, okay? Okay. I got this. This way. You have quite the ability to remain sneakily silent. I know I should've told you about me and Peter. It's okay. Lara Jean, I... I was just embarrassed. 'Cause I... I read it all wrong. No. It's totally my fault. I'm sorry. Since we're, um... Since we're coming clean about stuff... You know how you call me John Ambrose? Everyone calls you that. I know. It's because of you. What? Before sixth grade, pretty much everybody called me John. And then I met you, and you called me John Ambrose and said how it was cool that we both went by our first and middle names. I didn't wanna correct you, I liked how we had something in common. So I started telling people to call me John Ambrose. Wow. I don't know what to say. Are we good, John... Ambrose? We've always been good. Lara... Jean. Are we doing Brussels sprouts this year? Ah, nobody really ate them last year. Kitty says Fakesgiving's all about the potatoes anyway. Okay. Then, I think we're good. On second thought, I'll get us some Brussels. - Hi. - What you doing? You know, just... making a soup. What you got there? - Ah, these are good. - Yes, yeah, those are... those... I'd never seen my dad with a crush. But, there he was, laughing nervously with his hands in his pockets. He looks a little... hopeless. - Hi. - Hi. I was supposed to get some Brussels sprouts but I got distracted... - uh... for our... - Ah. I see. - Fakesgiving. - Fakesgiving. It's like regular Thanksgiving, but it's in March, it's a family tradition. Oh, my God, that's so fun. You should come. Yeah. Oh, well, I-I don't wanna... You don't wanna wait till November for turkey. Right? You wanna come? - Yeah, count me in. - Okay. I'll, uh, I'll text ya the deets. Okay. - No one says that. - That's some nice lingo. - I'm glad you're coming. - Me too. But there's something that I should tell you. You know that valentine that Dad sent you? Kitty made that. Wait, so you're telling me that the valentine that was addressed to Mrs. Rothschild in glitter glue... ...wasn't from your Dad? Well, that is a plot twist. Wait, did Dad get Brussels sprouts? He did not get the Brussels sprouts. Dad. What? - Get more. - Okay. - That's not enough. - Okay. Mm-hmm. All right. Is something wrong with the green beans? Uh, they're just a little un-Covey. No? I mean everything else on the table looks like it could be in one of my mom's food and wine magazines. - He noticed. - He's got a good eye. It's silly, we do a little thing where I get a can of green beans. No, it's symbolic. I mean, it's kind of, um, for Mom. Okay, it sounds like there's a story there. Is there a story? Oh, when I was in college, I got invited to a Thanksgiving party in a dorm room. But the weird thing is, it was the middle of March, and the girl hosting it was the coolest girl I ever saw. Evie, their mom. And she thought it was unfair that the two best holidays of the year were at the end of the year, right on top of each other and we should just spread the love a little bit and have a potluck for good ol' March. Right, and at that potluck, when everyone made homemade goods, Dad brought - canned green beans. - Canned green beans. Right. And she made fun of him the entire night. She made so much fun of me, I thought she was really mad at me. But after, her roommate told you that that's just how she flirts, right? See, she teases you. - Is that... - Nope. Uh... All right, well that is a really sweet tradition. - Thanks for sharing that story. - Yeah, thanks. Oh, there's one other tradition. Yes. Newcomers have to eat the beans. - Oh, I don't think that's necessary. - Oh, it is very necessary. Mom made you eat them, and Margot made Josh, so... Oh, well then, yeah. That sounds pretty set in stone. Okay. Bottoms up. I don't mind. I like canned goods. That makes so much sense. To Eve. Evie. Huh? Nice? You know what? It's not terrible. - Right? - There you have it. - That's what that is. - Can you pass the cranberry sauce? I'll cut some turkey. Will you take this, hon? - Yeah, of course. - Okay.

Listen, she was upset because there's some things happening with her mom and her dad and she just wanted to talk to someone who understands. - That's it. - That's it? Kavinsky! Let's go! Peter, that is everything. She is trying to prove that no matter what is going on in your life, when she calls, you come running. And when push comes to shove, you pick her, you pick her every single time. That's bullshit. Okay? I pick you. Lara Jean, when there was an actual choice, I picked you. An actual choice? Like, what does that even mean? She took that video, I told her that if she ever hurt you again then we were done. - So you knew? - Yeah, Lara Jean... You denied it. Because you guys already have so much bad blood between you two. I didn't... Look, I was just trying to... To protect her. Like always. No. To protect you. - Peter. - Covey. Seriously. Let's go. Sorry, LJ, but, yeah. Can we please talk about this later? How did she know? - What? - That night. I said I was going to bed. And Gen knew exactly where you were. How did she know? You were waiting at the hot tub for her, weren't you? Peter! You and I weren't, like, really together yet. And that's why she took the video. And if I hadn't come down to find you, you and Gen would be together, and you and I would've never happened. Maybe that's how it should be. Don't say that. You don't mean that. You should go. - D-Don't do this, Covey. - Go. No, we promised that we were not going to break each other's hearts. Yeah, well, I think that we both made promises we couldn't keep. Right.
