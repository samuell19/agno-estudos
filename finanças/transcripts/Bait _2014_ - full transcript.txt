WOMAN: Hey Bex! - Morning, Barbara, love. Just put on a bit o' lipstick, put your hair in pigtails and let me take you full tour. I understand the request. It won't be asking the world to show me a bit o' stocking and top as well. I tell you, it'll be the end of your world if you don't fucking shut up! Well, that's not very nice. Look, I'm not asking you to nosh me up. Oh, you've just as much chance. Really? Ugh! [snicker] Hey, Bex, did you hear about Pete Hardware? - Was he hammered again? - No, not like you think. He got jumped on the other night. Who by? I don't know, but, uh, somebody who really meant it. Knocked seven bells out of him, he's in intensive care, and Ron Tupperware reckons he could be blind for life. What? And you only think to tell me this now? I'm tellin' you now. But you've just been asking me for a blow job! No, I asked you for some pictures for a wank. The blow job was your idea. - Oh, you're a lovely man. - Oh, I am a lovely man. I'm very sensitive, I am, and I'll tell you this... I did a speech at Big C's funeral. - Who? - Big Clive, you know, big barrel of shite. Oh, creepy bastard. Yeah. You know what I said when I heard he were dead. He was gonna fuck all the kids? Cor! Have you heard what's comin' out of her mouth? I'm more concerned with puttin' somethin' into it actually. [sighs] Ugh, Jesus! That'll be a night your mum's out, is it? We could have the house to ourselves. You know, just... just go. Make it 50 times wittier and come back to me, will you? Love to your mum, which I'm sure you give her nightly after druggin' her. Go on! Away to fuck! Oh! Ethan didn't want those. Grandma-ma dropped them off this morning. Well, you can tell him from me, his grandma rocks! Yeah, I will. [sighs] it'll make all the difference. Oh, oh... I nipped back home. What? You skiving git! I barely coped! Oh. Yeah. Is it? [sighs] [chuckles] [♪♪♪] Sorry... Sorry. [gasps and groans] [screaming] Tomorrow! Oh, you didn't need to go through all this trouble. Two teas and a packet of biscuits. I'll have bigger trouble today. [chuckles] Yeah, I'll bet they keep you busy. They'd keep a team of zookeepers busy. [chuckles] - Not that I'd change it. - No. Well, apart from... [sighs] Am I gonna regret this? Hope not. I value me job. [chuckles] It's just... well, you hear things. Yeah, so do I. About the companies you're thinking of. And you're not one... of them. We've got a complaints book, this thick. Do you know what it says in there? - Go on. - Nothing. Nothing. The rule is, one complaint, and you're out. Can't afford to get a reputation, not in this game. There's too many tyrants about, too many bastards, pardon my language, but that's what they are. [sighs] I've not told a soul. I was the same. The same? Same as you... when I did it. I'd lost my job. I was an estate agent. A lot of people made a lot of money that they shouldn't have. I worked for somebody else. I did all right until I didn't. Tried to hide it, and then they came to repossess the house, and that was the first my wife had heard of it. I'm lucky she loves me... and she sees that I'm happy now. Doing a job that matters actually makes a difference. [sighs] Look, see these? I'm going to leave them. Hang onto them for a bit just in case you get the collywobbles or your lottery numbers come up. But if you're sure it's for you, well, you've got my number. You just give me a call. [footsteps] It was a pleasure to meet you, Miss Lawler. It's Caroline. Sit down and pass me a pen. [glass breaking] Tomorrow, right? [yelling] Right? [sirens] Have you read it? Don't give much away, does it? Gives away the fact the meeting is tomorrow. Yeah. Sorry about the state of it. East End's had it. Yeah, they won't be happy. Who? Well, it's not like we're gonna tell them, is it? It would be a bit weird. "Hello. Me son read your letter. He's autistic, and he likes to draw circles on everything." And we're ready? Of course we are! I'll do me sad face and you can wear that, that dress with your tits hanging out. How much more ready do we need to be? Well, I'd like to know what we're gonna say. You seem nice. Give us money. You're not really all that bothered, are you? No, no, Dawn. I want to spend the rest of my life on this market freezing me ass off, fending off borderline sex cases who drop stock on the floor in the hopes that I will bend down and they can rest their greasy fucking ball bags on my head. Who does that? Whore! [giggles] Jesus! You know, I gave up a job for this. No, no, no, no. You gave up a job and then you did this. Some of us have already spent our lives freezing our asses off in this market while others, good luck to you, have enough to make a fortune. - I sold cars. - Posh cars. And I hated it. - No, no, but... - No, no, but what? If you feel that I've dragged you back to do something that you don't really want to do because of a sense of guilt for leaving me in the shit the first time around? I don't! Then, then, I get it. But I want this, and I need it, and we've got a chance. So if you want out and you've got cold feet again, and I understand. I really do, but I'm seeing him tomorrow. Ever since that dickhead left me... stop laughing. [laugh] I'm laughing because you're ace when you're mad. - I'm upset. - Well, don't be. We will go and see them, you and me. So stop giving me all this me shit! And don't we have the plan? Well, you've certainly got a comprehensive set of figures here. Yeah. We've worked really hard on it. But of course, these are projections. The real work is turning it into reality. Oh, we're perfectly placed, are we? Pardon? We work on the market. Hmmm. Have you done the market research for your... uh... organic tea, coffee, and specialist cake shop? Yeah. And what did you find? Everyone we've spoken to has been dead positive. Well, how many people was that? Everyone we meet. I mean, there's a cup of tea and an ear-bending when you come through us. [giggles] Yeah, and um, a lot of people already go to these places. Oh, competition? Oh, no. Not near us. There's no one. No, no. Not since the last one shut down. [child giggling] Oh-h-h, what're you having for your tea? - Cocos. - Oh-h-h, good idea. Bad idea? What do you think? I think I should have a shower and eat. - No! - Oh, but Daddy's hungry. Bollocks hungry! Our daughter says that now. Since when? Since Gracie taught it to her apparently. Gracie, who says she's rubbish at PE and her ballet skirt smells? The latest one is she has small teeth. She's six. What's she meant to have? Then she slapped her, didn't she? Right. And what's the school doing while this is going on? Oh, it's just kids, isn't it? Evenin'. I was going to drop this off tomorrow. I trust you. See you soon. [birds chirping] - We'll do it. - We won't. It's just gonna take a bit more time, that's all. We've not got any more time. - Oh, here he is. - Just leave it. Oh, will you be off cracking one egg gettin' off pissin' on people's dreams. - Can we just go! - Oh, come on. [yelling] You bug wanker! [giggling] [dog barks] [baby cries] Mommy! Mommy! [gasps and groans] [gasping for air] - Where's the fucking money? - I... I'll get it! I'll get it! Oh, you'll fucking get it all right. [yelling] I'll get it! [grunts] [blows landing] [crying out] [baby cries] Hi, [speaking foreign language]. Hiya, Mama. [speaking foreign language] [sighs] Put some bloody clothes on. Felt like someone walked over me grave, that's all. [speaking foreign language] [giggles] Mama! [speaking foreign language] Nothin's the matter. Hey, come on. I know. Ya-di, ya-di, ya-di, ya-di, ya-di, ya-di, ya-di, ya-di, ya-di, ya-di, ya-da! [bird squaking] Cover, sweetie. I'm going to change. I wish I'd been smart like you. What do you mean? Well, I brought my best stuff, didn't I? The banker gonna wonder what we need the money for. I brought me best stuff. - [gasp] I'm sorry! - Sh-h-h-h! Sh-h-h-h! Sh-h-h-h! Bex, Bex, you do the talking this time. I'll just nod and agree. [breathless] Okay. Oh, for God's sake! Jesus Christ! Get away! Come on, get away! Get away! Go on, then. Say something smart. For any right-angle triangle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the other two sides. - Practice that, do you? - All the time. Pick-up line. Yeah. Well, it's better than "Nice tits. Let's do it." - [chuckles] - Go on, make yourself handy. Hold that. Keep the hairy hand gang from getting a look at me. Do you want me to go and have a word? [snicker] Oh, you being a hard man? They don't seem that dangerous. Well, you won't say that when they've tazered you. Well, yeah. That's how he kills his chickens. Poor sods. So, worked here long? God, you do need new lines. [chuckles] I'm only trying to be friendly. Are you new? Not... no. I did go away for a few years, mind you. Yeah? Doing what? [sighs] Selling, um, selling condoms. Outside your mother's house. What's it got to do with you? Aren't you a bit overdressed for the part? What? I work in a market. I can't look nice? You'd look gorgeous wherever you worked. Going to the bank actually. Oh, yeah? You got your gun and your balaclava? Something much more scary, my wit and personality. No. We're looking for a loan actually, and not a prison sentence. Oh, you star! Hello. I'm just going. Left, right, left, right. Pardon? It's how walking works. Give it a go. Nice meeting you. And good luck with the uh... [clicks tongue] Cheers! - Wish us luck. - Good luck. You'll get it. Gracie, now! [sighs] I have spin class in exactly 20 minutes, and if you make me late again because you're funnying around... - Excuse me. - In fact, I'm not going to be late. You can sit in the car while I'm in the gym, and you can be late for school. Um, I was hoping I could have a word. I'm late. I'm Chloe's dad from school. Does that somehow make me not late? Are you the new driver? [phone rings] No. No. Our daughters are at school together. [sighs] I'm standing on my driveway, and guess what I'm not looking at. Well, nearly's no good to me. [sighs] Well, I can't do any more than I already have. Speed bumps outside the school. I fast-tracked it, but I can't just give it the okay. Well, I could, but uh, how does that look? Besides, some of the little bastards need running over. [phone rings] Hello. Uh, yeah. I don't know about all of that. I... I just wanted to have a word with you about your daughter Gracie. Um, I mean, it's nothing really. It's just a bit of name calling, and I'm sure they're all at it, but Gracie's name seems to come up a lot. And now, there's been a slap. Which hospital is your daughter in? - Oh, she's not. - Well, what did the paramedics say when you called them? It's just a kid's slap, I suppose. Exactly. Now I suggest you go and tell that to your daughter. Okay. Well, cheers for all your help with that. Well, that's the end of it then. [whistles] Do us a favor, Nev. Consider pissing off. I'd have to think long and hard about that. How much of your stuff do you sell a day, Nev? I'll tell you how much. Close to fuck all. There you are moaning every night about all the stock you have to give away. You know what that is? Look, look, watch watch watch! You're not even there, and they're avoiding you. It just comes naturally to people to give you a wide berth. Your store is like a fucking exclusion zone, and that's why you sell nothing and that's why you make nothing and that's why you look like a fucking tramp and that's why no woman living, dead, nor not even yet born, would ever consider you anything more than a frothy, rancid, wobbling piece of shite! You snotty bad mouth! - Feel better after that. - Yeah. That was great. I tell you the real genius of that... the fact that he's on the allocation committee. So, when my contract's up in a month, he'll be well placed to tell us to piss off. He's not gonna do that with all the empty stalls, Dawn. He'll stick us in death corner then which is just as bad. So cheers, Bex, you just added another five years to me working in this shithole! Well, I think we would have been out sooner if you'd kept your mouth shut. Me? "Oh, no, not since the last one closed down." So now you're saying it's my fault. Well, no. I think that's exactly what he wanted to hear. Well, maybe it's as well he did hear it. Saves me mum wasting her five grand. Hello! My five grand! What do you think you're doing? Looks like you were starting a fight, so I was gonna YouTube it. Oh, yeah? I think you'll struggle with that stuck up your arse! [birds chirping] [car engine starts] This is not gonna do it. It's all I've got. Do better. I can't. Well, more incentive needed then. No, no! [yelling] No! [dog whines] Well, [sighs] I'm not sure it'll all look better with a few dirty butties inside you, but at least you'll be fat and greasy so you'll have other stuff to worry about. There you go. Comforting. So, what was the plan then? Get off this pitch. Open up a proper café. That's exactly what's needed around here. That's what we told the bank... sort of. So, you'll give us the cash now that you know what a great idea it is. [chuckles] Sorry. Might have contributed to a holiday though if it meant seeing you in a bikini. You hittin' on my mate? Oh, mates again, are you? Good. I was paying her a compliment. [sighs] It's wasted on me. Been so long since I had one, I wouldn't be able to recognize it. That is an outrage and a tragedy. Tell me where your husband is. I'll go and have a word. Southampton, last I heard, but that was seven years ago, and he was getting on a boat. So, good luck. Man's an idiot. [phone beeps] Excuse me. Sorry. Don't let them get cold. Hope to see you again. [giggles] Fucking pulled. [screams] ♪ We get one arm in And the other one through... ♪ ♪ And we have a look And what have we got? ♪ ♪ We've got two [speaking foreign language] - Mom! - What? Hi! What are you afraid of? That he will copy me? Ho-ho. I wish! I wish he would say anything. [speaking foreign language] Nyet, Mama! I'm only trying to help the boy. Hey, what's this? Your money back. I told you when I want the money back... When you are earning and you can afford it. Well, it's not going to be happening, is it? [speaking foreign language] One problem. There was only one plan. I don't know how you're living as it is. Oh, we go making shoplifting. How else do you think we spend our days, huh? We go and do the burglary, and we lift from the shops, [speaking foreign language]. We are rolling in it. [speaking foreign language] Just take it. Watch. Check... no check. I'll just write you another. Well, I will just do it again. I trust in you. You must learn to trust in yourself. [speaking foreign language] [chuckles] [speaking foreign language] Oh, get a room, the pair of you. Mind you, you'll have to fight for space with the man from the market. - Oh? - Shut up! Hey, have you got a new boyfriend? No! Tell Mama. Has she? No, no, no. I mean, he just gave her his number and he wants to see her half naked, but no, definitely not. Hmmm. Is he blind or mad or both? Oh, thanks, Mom. [speaking foreign language] I'm joking. - Come on! - Dawn-ka, listen to me. If you think Ethan is a problem now, you wait until I kick that bucket, and then you will really have your work cut out. You are young. [speaking foreign language] - Same again? - Yeah. No, no, I'm fine. Yeah, go. You sure? You want to phone a friend? I want to phone a dickhead. You wanna use my phone? Oh. Oh. Am I the dickhead? - Oh, I'm sorry. - No. Don't be. It's my fault. I'm sorry I'm late. Might be normal, for all I know. An hour after we said. I only go out about once a decade, so I don't really know the um... rules. Rule number one is, don't keep a beautiful woman waiting. It was a work thing. Still, no excuse. So, um, what do you do? - I'm a spy. - No, you're not. - I'm an ice cream man. - Oh, right. [chuckles] Well, I can see you in the little vans, that's all... Listen, I'm not buying you a drink until you're nice. Don't need one now. So. You thought you were being stood up, but you were staying anyway. Well, don't let me stop you if you've seen someone better. I'm staying because I've got a babysitter, so I thought might as well. So, you've got kids then, eh? Be mad if I hadn't, wouldn't it? No, one boy, 18. He's autistic. - Oh. That must be nice for you. - What? All the little pictures he must draw. Sorry. That was a terrible joke. I'll let you off. So, um, what about you? No, I'm rubbish at art. - Kids! - Oh! No. Vodka and tonic. Cheers, mate. You look even better at night than you do during the day. That's because it's dark. Because you're gorgeous. [♪♪♪] I love you. I love you. Sorry. Sorry. I overslept. - I bet you did, you dirty tart. - No. Is he a shouter? I bet he is. You know, "Take it, take it, take the lot!" He was extremely polite. Well, he didn't even wipe it on your curtains, no? Well, he might have done it in his own house because that's where he slept, I presume, while I slept in mine. I'm so disappointed in you. I did get drunk though. First time since the new year before last. What? And he didn't take advantage? Gay! He's nice. And you'll think so too, when I tell you me news. He fancied me all along, didn't he? He's gonna be our backer. Backer as in...? The shop. Okay. That is nice, after one date. No, no, no. It's what he does. What, just give money to random strangers? No, no, no. He's um, he's an investor bloke... a venture capitalist or whatever. Although he said no when I said that. Well, only small time. So not a twat then, no? Unless it's twatty to come up with the 10 grand we need. - Well, just like that? - No, no. He wants to meet us, see the place and that. Well, when? Whenever! Why are you not excited? I don't know. I mean, I should be. I... I... oh, I am. But, we don't know anything about him. Well, we didn't know anything about bank wanker. No. Look, he bought me a meal. He put me in a taxi. He didn't so much as try it once. His name is Jeremy. And he's a nice man. [car door closes] [birds chirping] Excuse me, can I help you? Who are you? What the hell is going on here? That man just punched me in the fucking face! I'm going to get the police! [grunt] Okay. Go easy with this, right? You care more about your bike than you do about me? Yeah. Exactly. So be careful. Wait. No, I don't. Good. It means I'm not wasting my time. Yeah, you are. See you later, smiley. [laughs] God, there's loads of room up there, for you and your design room. More space than last time? Or the time before that? Uh, um, can I ask you something? What? Are you always such a complete snatch? Maybe you'd like to wait outside. I wouldn't. Still... I bet he's amazing. Dead spiteful. I'm just on High Street. Don't know, some tire kickers. I reckon a big glass cake cabinet here. The drinks chiller's going there. Yeah, as well as I mean. Do you know what I'm thinking now? I'm thinking a little raised stage area here. We can hold little music nights and poetry readings. Oh, yeah, yeah, because we're massive, pretentious wankers. It'd cost though, wouldn't it? Well, you've got to speculate. Hey, what do you think, Jezbob? For the culture? You don't mind if I call you Jezbob, do you? I've heard worse. - Yeah? How bad? - Bex! What? Johnny breath, kitten dick? - Don't! - I'm sorry. You'll let me know about that last one, won't you? You'll have to excuse my friend Rebecca. She has an unfortunate way. Woo, totally passed me by. So, uh, um, Jezarino. This... this... this money, it's on the straight, right? No. I'm just one of those weirdos that likes standing around in empty shops getting insulted. So how does it work? You know, the um, the arrangements? You pay me back on the dot every week or I break [yelling] your fucking legs and then I start on your faces! Ahhh... - I think I need a lady nappy. - No, no! She doesn't, she doesn't! She's tight as an gnat. Stop it! Don't tell people you're wide, girl! Never! How long you going to be? Uh, are we inconveniencing you? Yeah. You are. Ages then. Right. Ten grand from me. You'll put five grand each in. If you need 20,000,'s enough to get you started. Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down now. I mean, [sighs] what's the catch? What? [laughs] I want it back. Wh... when? How? Well, how long do you think before you get it up and running, do you reckon? Um... uh, a month. Six weeks, tops. Start paying then. A grand a month. [sighs] A grand's a bit steep. Uh, can I... Can I have a minute? Yeah. Of course you can. Take your time. It just might not leave us loads for ourselves, to start. Oh, I mean, I guess it was always going to be difficult, to begin with. But a year down the line, we'll be keeping what we make. Um... I'm assuming we'll be paying you for a year. Not quite. Well, we would pay you interest though. There's no way we're not. - How many payments is that? - Forty. - Forty grand? - Forty months? Both correct. I should award some little trophies. You want four times what your lending us? Your math is amazing. You're going to do so well. We can't pay you that. [snicker] He's setting us up. It's Jezzball, the joker. I mean, 40 fucking grand! You know, I, uh... Well, is this what you do? Is it? You make promises to lonely women, is that it? I'm not lonely. Just so you can get a shag, be the big I am, and then when she doesn't, you're gonna pull a stroke like this on her? God, you're a dick! It's over! Not yet. Look, you don't want to do it, that's up to you. I'm not going to force you. Well, that's very nice of you. Maybe you'll have better luck next time with another bank. What do you care? But, there is this small matter of the funds I've secured. - What funds? - The £10,000. Which last night you specifically said you wanted me to lend you. - No, I didn't. - Yeah, you did. [snickers] "We've got ten. We just need the other half." "I can get that for you." "Oh, my God! Yes, please. That would be amazing." I've kept up my end. I'd had a drink. Look, I'm not going to force the money on you, but there are costs to me securing it. Hey, listen, I mean, once you've paid the finder's fee and the cancellation policy... It's been set there for 90 seconds, you fucking tit! You've incurred a few months' interest. You might as well take it. It's there. You can touch it. Start your business. When work is a pleasure, life is joy. When work is duty, life is slavery. I'll waive my charges, by the way. Well, fair enough. You're very good. Now I've got something for you, yeah. Yeah, right here. Here. Keep the change, all right? Oh, one more thing. [kisses] Ah! Enjoy that, ya penis. You don't think it's because I called him names, do you? No. He's just... [clicks tongue] a ball-bag. Seemed dead up front. "When work is a pleasure..." I mean, what a prick! What was he on about, we owe him money? He's just trying it on, isn't he? Like I've got money to be throwing away on him. Forget about it. I mean, [sighs] what's he gonna do? Jesus! Left, right, left, right, Liam. [♪♪♪] Hey, I didn't think I'd see you today. I told you, didn't I? You did, Lena, you did. Come on. Sit down. I'm fine. You don't look fine, Mishka. Hey, I've been telling this one off because he doesn't take you out. But I have a bone to pick with you. Why didn't you tell your Mama you have new boyfriend? Just happened to be here, did you? You know me. Don't work if I don't have to. I saw Ethan. Recognized him from pictures. I don't remember showing you any pictures. Oh. Well, must be a good guesser then. - I'll go and get him. - No! I could shout, but it's a bit hit and miss. - [speaking foreign language] - But you know it is. Leave him. I'll get him. We need to go. [speaking foreign language] He's cold. [speaking foreign language] Well, I'll be off. See you soon, Dawn. Really lovely meeting you, Lena. The pleasure is mine. [shouting] Looking forward to meeting you properly, Ethan. Ciao. Bye-bye. [phone rings] Uh, yeah, Dawn. Look, can I, um... uh, can I call you a bit later? Okay. Thanks, love. Said he thought they were waiting for him. Oh, it might not have been a "they." It might have just been one. You know what blokes are like. Fucking ten men. Took them all on. You know, he just went to go and get the bike to pick us up. They put a bag on his head... a plastic one. He could be dead right now, Dawn. All right then. Don't be shy if anything comes back to you. You didn't tell them much. There's not much to tell. You told me more. There's no point, is there? I'm sick of this place. Let's go. I think we better ask the doctor first. Well, ask, please. This town is a shithole. It's our shithole. We live here. We don't have to. We can live anywhere. We belong here. That's why I came back, you know. I don't want this to sound... harsh... but we've only been together for five months, and I've... I've known Dawn for a lot longer. I cannot, I cannot leave her in this shit again. They'll kill me next time. What? They knew things. He knew things. He? [sobs] The guy from the market. He knew my name. Where I lived. He knows you. Where you live. [sobs] All sorts of things. I-I thought you said he never spoke. Well, he did! [sobs] He spoke plenty... About what would happen if I go to the police. You don't believe him? Don't do it. Don't you fucking dare! Right? Okay, love, okay. [sputters] Oh God! It's okay. [sobs] [muffled groans] [groaning, crying] Your payment's due. [yelling] I don't owe you any money! - I say you do. - [grunting] Let's have more of a can-do attitude, shall we? [sobs] I could have come asking for the cash first, but I find my business works better when the warnings come unannounced. [groans] [sobs] I knew it was you! You could have killed him. You're right, I could. I could have done anything. I told him not to tell anyone. Might need to have another word. Yeah, well, good luck. He is gone. He is gone! I'm sorry to hear that. I'm glad you stayed. Three now. Grand. - You didn't lend me anything. - Yes, I did. Albeit briefly. Like I said, there's charges to consider. Plus... I gave you my goodwill. And right now, I'd say that was priceless. [crying] Oh God! I... I don't have that kind... that kind of money. Yeah, you do. You've got five grand. There is another way. [sobs] Let's do that, then. Let's do that. It would take you a while though. It's okay. What is it? Fuck off! [groans] It's okay. But now it's five. Hang on a minute. Five enough. Face it. Come on. [whistles] [sobs] [birds chirping] [♪♪♪] [no audible dialogue] Where have you been? Work. [sighs] Need more details? Will you tell our daughter to get ready for bed? Get ready for bed, darling. Is that top new? - Yeah. - Do they have it in navy? Check. - Bex! - [sobs] Lock it. I've been trying to ring you for ages. [Bex sobs] It's all right. It's all right. It's over. It's finished. [groans] Does it look finished? Does it? He's a fucking psycho! No. No. I've solved it. He's gone. He's never... he's never gonna bother us again. I've paid him me five grand, and... And he said he'd accept it as full and final payment. I can't have anything happen to me mom or Ethan. They've not done anything. So, that's the end of it. I can save it up again. It... it might take a while, but I will. We could open up a café next year, or the year after. I've done it. I've done it for us, Bex. It's over. [church bells toll] Where is it? [whispers] Where is it? Where's what? [heavy breathing] Where is it? [heavy breathing] I don't... I don't know what you mean. Where's my money? I paid you! I left it in the box where you said the box was, where you left your number. I hid it where you said. [heavy breathing] At the market, in the stall. The deadline was this morning. [heavy breathing] I left it. You bastard! You know it was there. £6000. [yelling] I've got nothing left! You'll find a way. [screams] [snickers] Amazing! [evil laugh] [on phone] Hiya. Hiya, Bex. Um, can you do tomorrow? I've got a sore throat. What we like... Anyway, um, I hope you've had a good rest, and I'll... [soft sobbing] [humming] [knock on door] [pounding on door] Hi, how you feeling? I'm all right. I'll come back tomorrow. - Oooh! - Just need a day, you know. [sighs] Yeah. Uh, do you have any whiskey? I'll make you one of my famous toddies. No. Do... do you want to nip out and get some? No, no, no. We'll make do. Hey, how's Ethan? - He's in his bed. - He's not with grandma? No. Not today. [footsteps] [heavy breathing] You have a sore throat, do you? Try taking his fucking cock out of it. She has now, thanks to you. You got my 5-1/2? You! - [smack] - Oh! [groans] Now why did you do... [bash] [groans] Argh! [snickers] Whew! A little bit inconvenient, this. Thanks for trying. But the debt still stands. But y-you said... [yelling] I'm saying the debt still st-a-a-a-a-nds! Cash only. Love to your mom. [sighs] Don't. He tried that on me, too, you know. And you didn't go for it. Well, well done, you. You said it was over, Dawn. Look at me. I'd rather not. I'm sorting it. [laughs] What do you mean? I wasn't fucking him for fun. You think a ride's going to fix this? Oh, no. No, I don't. I need to do it again and again and ag... And again, and I would. Do you know why? He knows where she works. He knows where she lives. You know he's not pretending, Bex. This is what he does, and he's just gonna go on and on and on. I can't stand it. I'd go to the police, but... I'm too scared. I want it all to just go away, and [sobs] I want it all to be dull and shit again. Do you not think I want to give me son the life he deserves? So yeah, yeah, I'd do it, as much as it took, but now you've gone and fucked it up. I was doin' it my way. Yes, Dawn. It's your way, Dawn, that got us in this state. [sobs] I thought he was all right. Yeah. That's 'cause you're a stupid fucking bitch! Well, so are you [sobs] for getting involved. I'm getting uninvolved right now. You know what, I should never have come back here. Liam is right. [yelling] This place is a fucking shithole! So are you. Oh, I'm done with you! Well, fuck off! Aw, fuck you! [door slams] [sobs] [crying] I'll make you that hot toddy. [sobs] I'm sorry. Someone will be with you as soon as they can. [sighs] [screams] Help me! Ten minutes, girls. [phone rings] Open it. It can only help us. [gasps] Bastard! I don't care. [sighs] [phone rings] It's pathetic. Just ignore it. I mean, who's going to see it anyway? You know, half his mates and a farmer in Venezuela. You know, I mean, it's not ideal, but it's not gonna make the news. It's not that. It's her. Dickhead's mum. Ethan's nan. I thought she was out of the picture. She's only out of the picture because she's got nothing on me. But he lost the case, Dawn. [sobs] I can't go through with all that again. Every year, every year, I still get a Ch-Christmas card saying, "I'll get you, you bitch. You'll know what it's like to lose a son." I might be combining a few there, but you get me drift. [sobs] Oh, she was always very stable. It'll kill me mum if she found out. [sighs] [whispers] Go! Of course, you can meet me. Yeah. I'm a bit busy now though. Yeah. I'll be in touch. Stop. What are you worried about? It's not even Friday yet. Sit down. Five grand. It doesn't even cover what you owe. Never mind her. It was a joint agreement. Joint agreement? What am I, a building society? I've probably got more morals than them. Anyway, I don't remember you doing much agreeing. Well, we are doing now. If you'll take that, please. It's five grand for nothing. Nothing... nothing? You're forgetting all the work I've put in. Mental and physical, including jumping your rancid bones. Nobody forced you. You did kind of beg. Just leave her alone, will you? Aw-w-w-w, touching. [sighs] Well, who am I to deny some little spastic a day at the roller coasters. Right? That's it? Am I leaving? Good job. [panting] [moans] Well, I wouldn't have thought you could fit another person there. Tell you what though, this woman lives at the Humbley. Pretty ways down the back end so you can hammer the bends. You moving in there permanently or are you coming out? [sobs] [screams] I don't do deals. I don't do favors. You don't ask to meet me and tell me how much you're gonna pay. [yelling] Who do you think you are? You entered into an agreement! [sobs] No! Stop! Please! £10,000. [screaming] You got an easy five. You just need the same again. Sell the bike. Remortgage the house. Steal. Suck off dogs. I don't care what you do. [sobs] [gasping] I can't, I can't, I can't. I think you can! [sobs] I can't do it! No? [sobs] [moans] Oh shit! There's nothing more you can do to me. [snickers] Of course there is. There's loads. [sighs] [coughing] Like what? What do you think I should do? [coughing] Change your career. [snickers] I did... to this. What did you do before? I did this before. Sort of. Worked for a finance company. Arranged loans, other stuff. Decent rates of interest, all very fair. Boring. Hardly paid. I don't like using these. Too loud and I can never work them properly. Always a last resort for me. [sobs] Why? Why do you have to do this? Because I never want to be poor... ever again. But mainly... [cocks gun] Because I'm really good at it. [gunshot] [whistles] [♪♪♪] [sirens] [heavy breathing] [sobs] [pounding on door] [♪♪♪] [high pitched ringing] What are we gonna do? [dog barks] [knock on door] Keeping you up? No. How's your ear? Pardon? [snickers] You are in good spirits. Am I about to be? Nearly there. How far short is "nearly?" Hundreds, not thousands. What's this? Hundreds. [snickers] Bedroom it is, then. Where's my money? Safe. It'll be safe once I've got it. Do you think I brought you here... To piss you off? That'd be a mistake. Hundreds, yeah? Yeah. That's a lot. We're gonna do a lot. Hey! I don't like a tease. I don't like a minute man. [bash] [groans] [tazer sizzles] - [slap] - [bash] [scream] [grunts] [grunts] [tazer sizzles] [grunts] [groaning] Dawn. [tazer sizzles] [groaning] Dawn? Dawn? [glass breaks] Fucker! [screams] [screams] Argh! [heavy breathing] [groans and grunts] [screams] Argh! [panting] [grunts] [screams] [jiggles door handle] [floor creaks] [knocks lightly on door] Well... [sighs] I'm getting the feeling I'm not really wanted around here, so... I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll go. I'm gonna go-o-o-o-o-o-o-o. Go for a little stroll. Hospital maybe. First though, [snickers] First I'm gonna make a little stop at your mum's. Say hello. Say hello to Ethan because that's where he is, isn't he? [snickers] Say hello and then maybe... take him for a little stroll. Somewhere nice and quiet. [door latch clicks] Aw. [snickers] [sobs] [laughs] [groans] [sobs] [groaning] No! No! Argh! [screams] [groans] [grunts] [shrieks] [crash] [sobbing] [screaming] [grunting] [engine humming] [sighs] Bex... grab his book. [retching] Dawn... [retching and panting] Thanks, love. See you again, yeah. Twenty P's she left us. [giggles] New girls, are you? I'm Mark. That's nice. This your new place, is it? Well-spotted. You two, have you done this before? Why? Is it hard? [chuckles] Wants to know if it's hard. Do you want something? I might. How far would you go? - Pretty far. - Yeah?
