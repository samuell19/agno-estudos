Let me go! Let me go! Let me go! Leave me… Release me! Let go of me! It's confirmed, boss. He's our target. No… Don't kill me. Hey! Ask him to text me after transferring the money. Okay. Where is that guy? What's he doing inside? He may land us in trouble. What, boss? - Boss, my foot! - Okay, boss. Breaking news for our viewers! The news I'm about to share has never happened earlier in this area. It's a rampage all around. A hyena has been spotted here. Saffron TV will give you live updates by the minute. People from nearby villages have gathered here. We have no idea what the hyena is going to do. Tell me, Joshy. Sathya, I'm trying to reach Parthiban. His phone is not reachable. Where is he? He must have gone to drop Siddhu at school. Try calling Siddhu. His phone will be in the car. If he gets in touch, please ask him to call me. Handle this properly! Place a barricade there. Hurry up! - Kumar. - Sir? - What's happening? - Sir, nothing's right here. Everything… Sir, nothing is right here. - If it continues, many will be injured. - Whom have they sent? Two experts have come from Wild Life SOS team. They've handled only cheetahs, but this is a hyena. Nobody knows how to handle this, sir. Parthiban, we have a situation. It's an emergency. Can you come here? All right, first, see the photo that I've sent you. Footprints are large. Maybe it's a spotted hyena. If so, it will be extremely ferocious. Okay. How soon can you get here? Promise me, you won't tell your mom that you were late for school today. You promise me that you won't tell mom that I took my phone to school just for today. Please, Dad! The situation is not under control, Parthiban. Hyenas are social animals, Joshy. They live in packs. If a hyena is alone here, either it has lost its way or the rest of its clan is dead. People will fear it and try to kill it. But we have to think how we can capture it alive. If you think like your men, it will feast on us happily. What to do now? What are you suggesting? Walkie-Talkie. - Hey, Channel 3. We are on Channel 3. - Got it. Dad, I'll come along. I'll be helpful. Stay in the car, my dear son. That will be the biggest help. I don't want to get chided by your mom. Okay? Put it! Put up the barricades. Push it here, quickly. Hurry up. Come on. - Why did you place the barricades? - DFO's orders, sir. Watch out. What are you looking at? Do it now. Sir, why did you place the barricades here? The animal will barge into the school. It's very risky. Please remove it. Ranger, listen to me. I'll give you my uniform. Do my job as well. Hey! What are you all looking at? - Place the barricade properly. - Come in, Parthiban. - Yeah, Joshy. - They think it's a joke. Such a mess! I don't know what to do. The situation is out of control. Get a tranquilizer from the sanctuary. I'll tell you when to fire and from where. Yes, okay. Catch it… It's scared and is looking for a place to hide. They are trying to kill it without understanding that. If this continues, the hyena will enter the school. Bring the tranquilizer to the west end of the school. Help! Help… All the kids should go in! All the kids should go in! Kids, get inside! Students, go to your classrooms immediately. It's an emergency! Teachers and staff! Please take all the children safely into the classroom. There is no time. Hurry up! Get in… Go. Get in! I got permission for a tranquilizer gun. I'm taking it, okay? Okay, sir. Parthiban. I'm in position. Joshy, wait! Don't aim at its neck like our usual procedure. Its striking force will be as heavy as its pitch of laughter. Aim for the lungs! Shoot. Darn. - Hang on. - This is the perfect time. Shoot, Joshy. The gun is jammed, Parthiban. A gun can't adapt to the situation and operate. It's a machine. You need to service it every month. - Siddhu? - Dad. Get your spear. - Give your shoe lace to Joshy. - Okay, Dad. - Don't go… - Run away. You heard your dad, right? Give me your shoe laces. - Uncle, give the javelin to me. - What? Get inside! Let's go! Parthiban, the spear you asked for is on its way. - Tell my dad that I'm throwing it. - Parthiban, here it comes! Hey, come on, move. Who is that man? His name is Parthiban. He's from Tamil Nadu. Animal rescuer. He runs a coffee shop nearby. Hey! - Get inside. - Please, sir. Come on, start. Wait a minute. Ask the questions in an order. The DFO will answer you. Look. This issue is not something out of the ordinary. It is our daily job. Animals migrate in search of food and water… We've got exclusive news. Why are you here instead of covering it? There's nothing to cover here. These forest officers didn't do anything. A middle-aged man in a white shirt that was tucked in. Find him and get the real information from him. That is exclusive. - White shirt. Middle-aged man? - Yes. Where do I find him in this crowd? Thalapathy His entry spells power Who is our brother? Thalapathy! You wanted a shirt urgently. - What happened, sir? - Stitch it and bring it. - What's this? It's blood-stained. - Stitch it. My life is in this town And I ain't going down You think that I'm crazy But I don't want the crown My life is in this town And I ain't going down You think that I'm crazy But I don't want the crown I'm just an ordinary person Yeah! I'm just a peace-loving soul I'm just an ordinary person Yeah! I'm just a peace-loving soul - Hi, chief. - Hi. - Morning. - Morning, sir. In this town… Hi, Thalapathy! My life is in this town And I ain't going down… Why isn't the temperature increasing? Some problem with the thermostat, sir. I've called them the service team. They will visit today. - The cakes are ready for delivery. - Okay. Can we dispatch them, sir? - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Just an ordinary person Yeah I'm just a peace-loving soul I'm just an ordinary person Yeah, I'm just a… Sir, this shirt is ripped badly. It can't be stitched. Do you know which shop my wife bought this from? - I don't know. - I'm in trouble. Hey, what's going on? How did the police get our photos? They are checking at the borders and checkpoints. The men who told us to kill the collector betrayed us and double-crossed us. Not only that, they leaked our photos. Don't go out for a week. Hide yourself. Please don't get caught. Meanwhile, I'll do something. Stay hidden. What do you mean? Where can we go right away? The four of us have no clue where we are and what is happening. We trusted you and came here, you got us into trouble. Do you think I'm mad? We can't go anywhere with our pockets empty. We can't hide anywhere. Arrange for us to come there. Please understand the situation. All those against the collector are being targeted. It will take more than a week to get support from the center. Don't call up till I call you. - Bye! - Hey… Hey! Why are you looking at me? Eyes on the road! What, boss? In the early hours of yesterday morning, some unknown men broke into the collector's guesthouse have throat-slit and brutally murdered… You didn't get ready yet? Oh, my shirt? I spilt chocolate on it, so I put it to wash and changed… I bought you that shirt for our anniversary with so much love. You've ruined it in every way possible. I have nothing to say now, let it be. My mood won't change today no matter what excuse you give. Do whatever you want. There's no change in my plan. I'm leaving in an angry mood. Half of my soul is yours for infinity Half of yours is mine for eternity Only love as weapon is the counterpart In a brave warrior's heart Though my hair has streaks of gray… Shall we pick up the kids from school? You are the love of my life… - Excuse me. - Excuse me. - Yes. - Hi. Yes, tell me. Chintu… M-Mathi's mother is unwell. Siddharth's father isn't well. I want to take her home. - Who are you? - His mom. Her dad. If pure dew unites with a storm volatile Love's warmth will protect all the while Only love… - A small peg? - No, I don't drink. - It's healthy and good for the weather. - Really? - How do you drink this, sir? - True that! Dad. We will be adopting this hyena. What name would you suggest for it? Elsa. Ghost. Hachiku. I'll suggest a name, but you guys shouldn't laugh. Actually, Subramani sounds good, right? Wrinkles, as we grow old together… Look ahead! I want you with me forever Only love as weapon Your heartbeats year after year… - Chintu, come here. - No, no. - Come on, it's okay. - Okay, go. Slowly. Come. You'll hug me, with your chest as my divine headrest… Do you like him? Weapon of love is yours to favor Always the brave warrior forever and ever Open it. Chintu. Sir.. No, you're not supposed to help. Please wait. Go! Hurry! Sir, no. - Is the shop on the left or right? - Over there, sir. Give me the bill. Sir, your shop seems empty. When do you have regular consumers? They will come after 6:00 p.m. - Good day, sir. - Bye. Staying here is risky. There's nobody to loot. Shall we go elsewhere? We'll wait till nightfall. Six o'clock. He and his useless thugs will be the death of me. Everyone on the road is panic-stricken and running around. At that time, the serial killer stands in the middle of the road and shoots blindly. There's already a pile of corpses on the road. He is notorious. He shoots whomever he sees. At that time, a brave and bold police officer arrives and fires at the serial killer. The serial killer runs and hides. The police officer reloads the gun and in that gap, the serial killer fires. Hey… So the wounded police officer falls at your feet. He falls at the place where you were safely hiding behind the car. Now the police officer's gun is in your hand and you have a clean shot. The serial killer doesn't know that you are there but you can easily shoot him from your position. We got only Rs. 300. And just this phone. Hey! Get rid of this and look for a bigger car. And you have an easy way out. You can even escape without being seen by anyone. What will you do? Picture yourself. I'll just sleep. Oh! Will you just sleep? - Yes. - Siddhu, it's getting late. Go to bed. Wait, Mom. Just a couple of minutes. I'll take the easy way out and bring in more police officers. No, by then, the serial killer will kill more innocent people. When the moon sails by In the night blue sky She showers love and makes me yearn… I'll give the gun to the police officer. And say, 'Look, here's a clear shot, fire.' He's bleeding, dude. How can he shoot? Picture yourself. P-Please help… - What is the number? - Please! She's a nuisance… - Hello? Wait. - Where are you, dear? Here. Ask him for the ATM PIN. Tell him I'll kill him otherwise. - We can't move due to the police. - Tell me. - Please do... - Hey! Don't raise your voice at me! I would've been better off marrying a tree instead. Help me! - PIN? - Please don't hurt me. - What's the PIN? - Don't hurt me. - What's the PIN? - Please. - No. - What's the PIN? Please don't. Then I'll shoot him myself. If you shoot him, you'll also become a murderer. It is against the law. Think of something else. Picture yourself. Hey! Why did you shoot him? How did you get this gun? - PIN? - What? PIN? I don't know what else to say, Dad. Whichever way you see it, my hands will be blood stained. How does it matter if it's the blood of a saint or a sinner? Siddhu, go. Go upstairs and sleep, It's getting late. Chintu, come. Dad! Dad! The only option is to shoot him. Whom do you intend to shoot? The killer in the picture-yourself story. Picture yourself? I already told you. Then you'll also be a murderer. You'll end up in jail. You can't even sleep peacefully. Is that okay? I won't be sent to jail. I'll be sent to a juvenile home. And if I'm lucky, I'll get a sewing machine. I Googled it. Go! - What were you busy chatting? - Nothing. What time is the wedding? We'll drop her at the school and reach on time. He knows everything, right up to getting a sewing machine! Both of you, please sign. - Congrats. - Thank you. Are you guys witnesses? Please come and sign. - Congratulations. - Thank you so much. I'll see you guys. - Bye. - Yeah, see you, sir. You can touch her only after I say so. Take good care of her. - Bye. - Bye. What about you, madam? I've some work in the record room. I'll go home by myself after that. Do you wish to say anything? Stop telling Siddhu such nonsense picture-yourself stories. - Why? What happened? - Show me your phone. Browser history. Browser history? Mine or his? - His, of course. - Oh! "How to hunt? How to kill a deer?" "How to kill a hyena?" "How to get successful in life..." - Is it a joke? No, I'm just reading it. Who taught him all this? How does he know? Okay, I'll ensure this doesn't happen again. - I'll keep an eye too! - Okay. Great horned owl, Joshy. It's already in the protected species' list. Where did you get this? Sir, this owl is from Australia. We caught it. We know about it. - He's lying, sir. - I'll slap you! Is it necessary to do this at this age? How many more owls did you catch? Just this one, sir. I hit it with my slingshot. It fell down unconscious with a thud. Joshy, inform Blue Cross. It needs immediate treatment. Send for our veterinary doctor too. He's no more. - What do you mean? - Yeah, I forgot to tell you. He died on the spot in a car accident last night. I think he lost control and fell headlong into the valley. Yeah. What? Okay, I'll come. Yeah. It's not a car accident. It was a planned murder of the veterinary doctor. Murder? How come? He was shot dead. I just got the information. Did they use a gun in our town? Last week, when the collector died I thought it's a hit and run case, but now the veterinary doctor… Looks like a killing spree. I don't get it, Joshy. I've lived in this town for the past 20 years. I've never heard of anything like this. How did anyone get a gun in this town, Joshy? Parthiban, why are you anxious? We'll take care of it. I'll go now and check. Shall I come along? Last week, when the collector died, I thought it's a hit and run case but now the veterinary doctor has been killed. Looks like a killing spree. Dad, it is your turn. Dad! - Your turn. - Okay. My sweet honey, dark as ebony Why did you become my fair lady? I won't touch you, my princess But if I do, I can't stop my caress My sweet honey, dark as ebony Why did you become my fair lady? I won't touch you, my princess But if I do, I can't stop my caress My king is so handsome With a smile so winsome Love-goosebumps you give me I won't let you go scot-free Without you caressing me Shall we share our desire Like the warmth of blazing fire? Soft as cotton am I and ready Shall we ignite in rhapsody? Shall we share our desire Like the warmth of blazing fire? Soft as cotton am I and ready Shall we ignite in rhapsody? My sweet honey, dark as ebony… Sir, I've finished work. May I leave now? Sir, don't tease me. I'm going back to the hostel. Go. My song is much better than yours. Wait for the next special item. Shall I play it? First look there. The shop is closed, sir. Thirupaachi… I want chocolate coffee. It's closed, sir. Didn't you see the sign outside? Chocolate coffee. - The shop is closed, brother. - Chocolate coffee. Sir! I've cleared up everything inside, sir. Can I come an hour late tomorrow? I'm going to visit the temple. The shop is closed, sir. Shruthi, leave now. Hurry up. I'm talking to you. Can you hear me or not? - The shop is closed... - Shruthi. Go, I'll talk to him. Hey! Let go of my hand! Sir! Sir! Brother. Shall we share our desire Like the warmth of blazing fire? Soft as cotton am I and ready Shall we ignite in rhapsody? Shall we… Hey! The gun is missing. Check if he has taken it. Let me go! - Brother. - Yes? I've brought all the cash I've got here. Let me know if you want more. I'll withdraw it and give you. Let her go, please. This is wrong, brother. Let her go. Please, I'm begging you. Chocolate coffee. Let me go. Stay right here. Don't come out till I tell you, okay? Sir! - I went crazy… - Let me go! On a spell so dizzy… Boss, he is inside. This is my job daily, to think of you gaily My job is to think of you Night and day all through… - Hey! Shut the gate! - Let us think this happened, indeed Let us transform our thoughts to deed - Sir! - When… - Spread a mat and then… - Sir! - Sir, do something. - Hey! What did I tell you and what are you doing? Like the warmth of blazing fire Soft as cotton… Sir! Sir! Hey, our job is done. Let's go. Hey! Come with me or just die! The guy, this girl, the child and the CCTV here are all aware of our identities. If we leave like this, we will be nabbed by tomorrow. What do we do? Do you want chocolate coffee? Like the warmth of blazing fire Shall we share our desire… - Sir. - Bring it. Sir! Hey! Clear the CCTV footage. Sir, help! The lotus and its water Never fight with each other No one is around, Hug me in a tight embrace Like salt in pearl millet adds to treat My porridge of life turns into a feast Hey! I won't spare you! Your face is embedded in my heart With my tongue, I can touch my nose You touched my soul with your glance You're trying to kill me! Kill him! No one is around, embrace me Hey! The way IR8 rice boils well and blends You bonded well with me You irrigated so well My drought-ridden heart swell Like a mother cat with her kittens You swirled at my feet smitten Feeling sorry, I petted you softly You snarled to bite at me - Dad! - I own your soul, heart and body Dad! Shruthi! Chintu! Your hands caressing my cheeks gently Chocolate coffee? Dad! Dad! Will a bud blooming into a flower now Without feeling shy, express love? Is it fight or honey-duet To the flower and bee in pursuit? The lotus and its water Never fight with each other I want to hug my dearest beloved Even though he isn't yet my husband Let's go to the riverside with a tree It is a solitary love-spot When the tide ebbs aside Let us return gratified I can teach you to swim happily Come with me, my one and only Let me tell you right now, hush! Here and there my hands brush! Even spots on the Moon can be wiped clear But you can never be reformed, dear Even if overturned and hit A turtle's shell won't break a bit Hey! Sir… Hey! Let him go! Or I'll stab her! Sir! Sir! Kill him now. Where are you off to? Hey! Dad! Dad! Chintu! Dad! Dad! Parthiban! Parthiban. Lal, drive to the hospital first. It doesn't look like a clot. No physical injuries. But she is showing signs of PTSD. This child is in shock. She is bound to feel anxious. But there's nothing to worry. I'll give her some medicine. Take good care of her, okay? Parthiban. Parthiban, stop thinking about it and getting upset. Anyone in your place would've done the same. We will face the consequences. I'll be there for you. I'll take care of the children till you get released. - But don't regret... - Sathya, I don't know what happened. He went towards Chintu. I saw him. I was… After that… - Sir, I can't wait any longer. - May I go in? Parthiban, the police officers are waiting outside. They say they can't wait any longer to start the remand procedures. - Joshy, without this remand... - Sathya, are you kidding? Do you know the seriousness of this? Five of them have been killed. What do you want me to do? He's a murderer now. He has to be remanded for 15 days. We have to follow procedures. We can handle everything after he's produced in the court. Don't panic, okay? Parthiban, let's go. - Come on… - Thanks. According to the ballistic reports, five bullets fired from the gun penetrated the victims' foreheads at point-blank range. Not a single bullet misfired. A person who has never handled a gun before was able to fire five bullets in a split second. How? Sometimes, even trained police officers struggle to shoot below the knee. But without being least perturbed how could he shoot five times at point blank range? Inspector Bhawar Jetha. Compare Mr. Parthiban's shooting skill with that of a few ordinary men. This court orders proper proof backed with adequate explanation. Nazrat! Go and stand over there. - Hey! Stop! - Shahid. Note down everything. Sashikanth. - What are you doing? - First lower the gun. Parthiban! Parthiban! Step forward. - Kumar. - Sir? Give him the 9 mm. The man who killed my husband and my younger brother… Only after I send him with his family to their graves will I allow the funeral rites of my husband to be performed. I take this vow! I promise! I swear by both of them! It's okay. Parthiban, here… Your action was only a general exception. Don't worry. Parthiban! The ones you killed weren't good people. They are all gangsters. It will come under self-defense. Okay? Nothing to worry. We'll take care. Okay? Your Honor, a few days ago, when a spotted hyena strayed into our town, everyone wanted to kill it but my client risked his life and saved the hyena from the people's cruel assault. This is my question, Your Honor. How can a man who loves even a beast to this extent kill those five men? He killed those ruthless men in an act of self-defense with the sole intention of saving his employee, his daughter and himself. Your Honor, the mighty penal code may insulate this gentleman's act of self-defense. Bearing in mind the interrogation, arguments and statements debated here, having scrutinized this case thoroughly, Mr. Parthiban, the accused, remanded for the crime as per IPC Section 103 and 106, has been proven innocent. The court pronounces its verdict. Also, I recommend to our government to award Mr. Parthiban with the National Bravery Award for this year. Parthiban, walk free with your head held high. Move! - Move them out of the way. - Move aside. Move out of the way. Ask them to move out of the way. - Is the decision to acquit you right? - Move. What's the reason you had to shoot five people? Come. Give me that. Get in. Sir… Move! Move. Move out of the way. - Sir… - Sir! You okay? Dad. - Yes? - You were right, Dad. Even if we're holding a gun, we shouldn't shoot. That isn't easy. I can picture myself. I feel sorry for you, Dad. I can't bear to see you like this. The dead men have many cases against them. They aren't ordinary criminals. This is a loss to their acquaintances. Do you think they will keep quiet? To be on the safer side, be careful, Sathya. D'Souza, here you go! I can't forget everything and go back to normal at the coffee shop, Sathya. I'm unable to focus. I'm scared of the voices Of the click, of the beat Of the music I've been hearing all night Pause, play, repeat! I'm scared of the mountain Of the river, of the fire Of the sound of lightening in the sky Those sounds make me wanna cry -This light above me -I'm shit scared of that -Those colors -I'm shit scared of that -These speakers -I'm shit scared of that -Those woofers -I'm shit scared of that -Bad trip -I'm shit scared of that -Those chills -I'm shit scared of that Shit scared of A, shit scared of B Okay, I'm gonna pee! I'm scared of the night I'm scared of the day I'm scared of my shadow Get it out of my way I'm scared of my past I'm scared of my future I'm scared of the present Can't take this torture… - Dad! - I'm feeling cold, I'm feeling hot Just living in fear of getting caught I'm scared of the creepy I'm scared of the crawly And I swear, I'm not on molly This light above me -I'm shit scared of that -Those colors -I'm shit scared of that -These speakers -I'm shit scared of that -Those woofers -I'm shit scared of that -Bad trip -I'm shit scared of that -Those chills I'm shit scared of that Shit scared of A, Shit scared of B… I kept it somewhere here. Where is it? What are you looking for? You won't find anything there. You need to buy something to claim that it's missing. How much longer will you hide at home, Parthiban? The cafe has been closed since ten days. You aren't even sending your daughter to school. Just look at their faces. Not only have you confined yourself to the home you've kept your family locked up within these four walls. How long will you shut your ears when you hear a slight noise? Go get some fresh air. I'll take care of the house. Take your family out first. Go! I feel like drinking coffee. I'm stepping out to buy a packet of milk. Do any of you want anything? - Greetings, sir. - Hello, sir. - Hi, sir. - Greetings. He is a brave man. Parthiban, I need to buy something in that shop. You guys come with me. Buy whatever you wanted. Come, Siddhu. - Take care. - Okay, Dad. Mom, I want bread omelet. Okay, I'll buy it for you. - One bread omelet, please. - Okay, ma'am. - You give it, I'll be back. - Okay, Mom. - Hello? - We've got an SOS alert from CR, sir. - It's a pitch deck information. - Yeah. There's some suspicious activity in town. Parthiban's family is in danger. We got this information from an undercover agent two weeks ago. But the inspector hid it. So inform his family not to go out without protection, sir. Yeah, okay, I'll call you back. Parthiban, where are you? - I'm at the market. - Does anyone seem suspicious around? Parthiban? - No. Why? - The department got information that some unwanted elements are here. Do me a favor, just drop whatever you're doing and get back into the car. Right now, please… Hey! Only after I kill you and your family and take your head with me, will I bury my brother-in-law. Behead him! Parthiban! Hey! Sathya, move back! Why do you lay your dirty hands on my family? Parthiban, don't! Listen to me. Parthiban! Parthiban! Parthiban, don't! Listen to me! - Let me go! - No! Parthiban! Parthiban! What are you doing? Leave them alone. If I let them go, they will kill us! Parthi, I'm scared to see you sitting here like this. We could've come when the inspector called, right? Let's go home now. I'm not going anywhere. - Kumar! - Sir! Why is it so crowded outside? Is it a fish market? - Parthi, let's go. - Go and see. What are our men doing outside? What is it? I'd asked you to register a complaint and leave, right? Why do you insist on waiting for the inspector? Don't we have any other damn work? Go to the writer's table and he'll write what you say. Either sign or stamp your thumbprint and leave, understand? I'll see to it. Hey! Send my tea inside. Where are you going? What will you see? Will you see us die? Do we have to live in fear and wonder who will attack us every time we step out? Why are you getting worked up? Two weeks ago, one of the corpses from the shoot-out went missing from the mortuary. The department asked you to alert us. Why didn't you caution us, sir? Who told you all this? The ranger? Look here. Do we have to think of you 24×7 and serve only you? In all fairness... - Wait, dear. Wait. - Please, let's go, Parthi. In all fairness, I did what you should've done. I had no choice but to shoot those who tried to kill my daughter. They died! That's all. Please. No need. Let's go home, please. - Please. - I want an armed guard posted at my house 24×7. I won't leave until then. Hey! Get up, man! I'm telling you to get up! Get up! Get up from here! Please. Let's go. Do you think you are a politician with clout? Get out! Out! He wants an armed policeman, it seems. You can't just order and get an armed cop at your disposal. The law and the government must pass the order. - Let's go, please... - You are neither the law… - Please. Let's go. - …nor the government. You are a common man who sells bun and butter, Parthiban. - Let's go, Parthi! - Come in. We were waiting for you. - He can't tolerate noise. - Let's go, Parthi. We should stand outside his house holding a gun for his safety, it seems. And he'll sit inside the house, hugging his wife... Hey! You're a police officer! Mind your words! What did you say! - Hey! - Parthiban! - Let go! - Parthiban, let him go! Parthiban, don't! He's a police officer, leave him. Let go! Parthiban! Listen. Let go of him. Hold him back, guys. Come on. Parthiban, you've already been arrested once. - This will become a huge issue. - Parthiban, let go! - Parthiban! - Parthiban, don't! He's choking, Parthiban! Parthiban, he'll die! Parthiban, let him go! Sir, are you alright? Is your neck okay? Parthiban. Why did you do it, Parthiban? I told you to let him go. They won't give you police protection at your behest as you think, Parthiban. There's no proof of assault against you. You haven't sustained any injuries. Who said that I'm not injured? Parthiban, are you really sure? Joshy, I may go overboard if I do it myself. You do the needful. You asked for it! - SP. - Yes, sir? - Can you come to my residence? - Okay, sir. - Now. Yes, it's urgent. - I'm coming, sir. Sir, one small request. Please give me a police officer from Tamil Nadu. Napoleon reporting to duty, sir! Where is my position, sir! Hush! Who is this man? Parthiban, you requested for a high-ranking Tamil police officer. He is that high-ranking police officer. You must've heard of a drug bust in Trichy. I heard he was responsible for finishing off 50-60 of those men. - Move these tables over there at once. - Okay, sir. Go. Hey! Put your phone down. Listen! What do you want? Wait! Are you a Tamilian?

There's a girl who has been looking at you for a long time. Don't turn around immediately. Could she be from the press? - She left. - Similarly, a man at the back has been here for a long time. He isn't saying anything. Go and have a word with him. - Where? Behind? - In the backyard. - Okay. Go, I'll handle him. - Okay. "Pleasure is mine." Hi, sir. What would you like to eat? Coffee. - Sugar? - You know very well whether I take sugar or not. How would I know whether you prefer sugar or not? - With sugar. - Okay. I'm sorry, sir. - One sugar cube or two... - You know that too. Sir, I don't know that. You've mistaken me for someone else. I was thrilled to hear you speak Tamil. I'm just humoring you, that's all. Your coffee, your sugar. Leo? Leo! Parthiban. I don't know anyone named Leo, sir. There's already a lot of confusion here. Please don't add to it. Please drink your coffee and leave. Do you mind? Can you make it a little stronger? Sure, sir. Do you know this brand, Leo? No, sir. I don't have the habit of smoking. - I can't even stand the smell. - D Slash. You used to call it Honey Badger, but it is Black Devil. Twenty-five puffs. The flavor that you created. You really like nocturnal animals, right? Once a Honey Badger entered our tobacco field. Do you remember? It didn't get caught in your trap. It didn't get killed by Harold's spear either. In the end, it died by the bullet that I fired. I think you've forgotten it. Do you want anything other than coffee or shall I get the bill? Have you convinced yourself that your old identity doesn't exist, Leo? Wait, what? Listen. I've many problems on my mind. I've a splitting headache. I'll tell you in a way you'll understand, one last time. You've mistaken me for someone else. I have very less patience, dear. So don't waste my time. Mount View Lodge. Come of your own accord and admit that you're Leo. Sir, alcohol is not allowed. No alcohol! No alcohol. A friend of my friend is in Kadapa. I sent him a photo of the D Slash cigarette box and got some details. Going by what he says, the chap who came here is Antony Das. Once upon a time in Andhra Pradesh, he ran a huge tobacco company. - After a big fire accident... - Hold on. Why should I know the life history of the guy who barged into my cafe and blew cigarette smoke in my face? No, but this is important. - No, I... - Let him complete. Go on, Joshy. Antony Das has a son named Leo. Okay. Leo Das. I couldn't find any details other than his name. One group says that he did something big and died. Another group believes he is still alive. He can fool this town. He can fool the world. But he can never fool me. In some odd way, you have a striking resemblance to him. I saw his eyes. I know his eyes. It is him. Parthiban, you grew up in an orphanage, right? - Do you remember anything from before? - What is this? This is bullshit! We are the victims here. Do you understand you are treating the victim like an accused? - Let's leave, Parthi. - Wait, dear. Sathya, one moment. Joshy. I get that you are asking this out of concern. But since my childhood until I was 20, I grew up in Sathyamangalam Orphanage. And I met her there… What was that, dear? That… Munnar trekking. There's where we met. I saw her. I got to know her. Within two days, I asked her if she'd marry me. That's all. After marrying her, we settled here because of her job. This has been my town since then. This is my story. They have also come from the south, Parthiban. If they've crossed so many miles and come by road to our place in search of you, something is amiss. Whatever came to a grinding halt because of him needs to be completed using him. I know how to bring him back into our fold. My world is very small, Joshy. It's like a snow globe that fits in the palm of my hand. A small independent house, surrounded by trees, snow, cool breeze. Why is this happening to me? Do you understand what I'm saying? I'm sorry. It's alright. I understand. If they come back to cause further trouble, we'll inform the police. Keep an eye on his family and friends. I'll take care of it. I feel like someone is watching our home, Sathya. I don't know, Sathya. The eerie silence makes me restless. I feel very disturbed. Look here. Understand this. You should feel this way only if I suspect you. Have I ever questioned you? Stop thinking about these things and sleep peacefully, come. Won't you come? Okay, shall we stand like this and sleep? Don't touch the engine, just fix the heater. I want my vehicle. Get it ready by evening, okay? What do you want? I saw you, right? That's enough for me. I'm so mad at you, if I slap you now your mouth will be injured badly and it will seem like a weird smile is plastered. I'm sorry. - Get out! - I'll leave! I'll leave. - Tell me, dear. - I bought the tablet you wanted, Parthi. Do you want anything else? I've given the jeep for service. Didn't I tell you that we can go later to the pharmacy? - Why did you leave the kid alone at home? - I brought Mathi with me. Priya is also with me. Okay. We could've waited for a day. What was the hurry? Some things can't be delayed, right? It's not a problem. I'll take an auto home. - You take care. - Okay. Go home and call me. Let's go. Come, dear. No! There's nothing to panic about. It is the same blood. Do you know who she is? My granddaughter. My blood. Yesterday you were the one who… You better leave or I may have to call the police. Police? I haven't come to trouble you, dear. You've been living with a guy who you believe is Parthiban for the past 20 years when you realise he was a ruthless killer who committed many murders, come and meet me. I'll show you the true colors of your husband. - Hello? - Why didn't you answer the call, Parthi? - He was here. - What happened, Sathya? Who? Who was there? The same guy! You said he visited the cafe yesterday! He came to the medical shop looking for me. Okay. Where are you now? I am at home. They followed me in their car. It is parked outside our home. Sathya, close the doors. Give the phone to the police officer. He is missing. No one is here. I'm scared, Parthi. Lock yourself in our bedroom safely. Siddhu is coming. I'm also on my way! Answer the call! - Dad, what is it? - Siddharth! Go home immediately - and pick your spear and go in. - What are you saying, Dad? If anyone tries to enter the house, throw your spear without hesitation. Okay, Dad. Will our lives be like this now, Parthi? We have to be on the run. Then we have to hide. We should live in fear wondering what might happen to our kids. Right? Tell me. Who is he? He claims that our daughter is his granddaughter. I feel terrified when I look at him. We don't usually pay attention to how our heart beats but today, I could feel every beat as I made my way home. Chintu, come here. Don't call her! She's already terrified. - Listen… - I forced the police department, I fought with the law, and went to great lengths to bring you to my doorstep. I asked you to protect my family. Do you possess any integrity or job ethics? Don't say that. There's no use talking about compassion or concern to those who work for money. Instead of doing your duty like this by just eating and sleeping uselessly, pick up your belongings and go away! - Don't say that, sir. - What? - Don't act on impulse. - Under the pretext of making excuses don't provoke me to swear at you. - I went to recharge... - Don't talk. Don't talk! - I went to recharge... - Don't talk! I'm letting you go out of respect for your age, or… You've misunderstood me. - Dear… - Go. Just go. I'm sorry, Dad. - I didn't know that it was you… - It's okay, Son. Good throw. - You knew it was me and threw it, right? - No, Dad. When you realize that the man sharing your bed is a ruthless killer with no mercy, come and meet me. Was it a dream? It must have been a nightmare. I think some major conflict occurred between the family members. It seems this is also a reason for their tobacco industry to get destroyed. I have sent the certificates and photos to you. I want to know if they are forged or not. Okay? Okay, bye. It's a myth that stands still, Joshy. But I believe a man who knows the full story is alive in Shimla prison. His name is Hridayaraj D'Souza in the records. If the intel is right, he must be very close to Leo Das. So if you want to see him, you have only two days. Practically, I don't know when you can reach. - Can I try to connect him in a call? - No… I-I'm on my way, make the arrangements, please. I'll reach by tonight, okay? - Sure, Joshy. - Thank you. Who is the villain here? It's late. Your mom isn't back yet. Recently, she has been returning late everyday. - Isn't it? - Yes. That's her. - Tell me. - Parthi, I'm not coming home tonight. Don't wait for me. Have your dinner and sleep. - Why? What happened? - I've taken many days off, right? So there's a lot of pending work. I thought I'll finish it and come home in the morning. I yelled at Siddhu this morning, so he isn't answering my call. Is he back home? Where is he? Poor boy, I was quite harsh. Check on him, Parthi. Ladies and gentlemen, may I have your kind attention, please? Okay, where are you now? - At the head office. - Is that so? - Chintu. - Yes? You don't suspect your dad, right? - No. - Why? Because you are my dearest dad. Your dearest dad. Hey! It's your dad. Siddharth, get into the car! - I'm calling you, get into... - Let go of my hand! Sir, leave him alone if he doesn't want to come. Don't force him. What? Will you kill him too? Okay, don't come. Who is the villain here? Who is the friend, dear and near? Who is the villain in the end? Who is the friend and godsend? If I see any of you following my family hereafter… Hey! Go with your dad. Who is the villain here? - Sir. - Why are you sitting here in the cold at this hour? No intruder will barge in now. I don't care anymore who shoots and who dies, go to sleep. It's okay. It's okay, sir. A courier was delivered in the noon in your wife's name. Sir, one moment. I wanted to tell you something. I understand all your worries and fears. I see how well you take care of the people who depend on you. You are anxious and upset that something might happen to them. I'll retire in 60 days. If anyone troubles your family in any way during this time, I'll take him down with me! Even if there is any emergency needing my attention back home I won't leave this place. I swear this Napoleon doesn't work just to eat like a glutton, sir. I don't work just to fill my stomach. Trust me, sir. Did you really lift such a big gun at the commissioner's office and shoot all of them? All I did was read the manual and instruct as to which button to press. Dilli took care of the rest. Don't tell anyone. This is my means of livelihood. Okay. - Chintu. - Dad. Why don't you sit? - How is he doing? - He is fine. It's been nearly three weeks since he called me up. All okay, right? Why take the trouble to visit me at this hour? Had you told me, I'd have couriered it. The government registration is pending without proper certificates. We came here on some other job. - So we decided to collect it. - Oh. It's in the attic. Let me get it. Sir, this is Hridayaraj D'Souza. Counting of heads will take place in 20 minutes. I'll wait over there. Finish your conversation soon. You asked for this brand, right? Hridayaraj D'Souza. I'll come straight to the point because of time constraint. Das & Co Tobacco Factory. The duo associated with it, Antony and Harold. We have identity records on both of them, but we have no details about Leo. You are the only one who is alive among Leo's associates who were present during his death. I have only one request for you. If you can tell me whether this is Leo or not, four lives will be saved. I understand. I can see the fear of death in your eyes. I heard you are due for a death sentence in three days. If you can narrate what actually happened, I can send a petition now and appeal for a review of your death sentence. If you could tell me the actual sequence of events… Hridayaraj, don't test my patience. If you're here for a fair and just cause, why this back door entry and sitting near the toilet? I've said what I had to, in the court. No one can stop my death sentence. What else? What happened at Das & Co Tobacco Factory? Is Leo alive or dead? Or how did Leo die? I'm not saying this for you or your damn bribe of a booze. Anyway I'll die in three days. After that, I can't talk about him. That's why I'll tell you now. In the year 1999, Das & Co was the most flourishing tobacco factory in Andhra Pradesh. The one who built and ruled that empire was Antony. Antony Das. Das & Co Tobacco Factory was just a front to conduct many illegal businesses. He developed the business to local, national and international levels. Antony was never the kind to forget or forgive those who opposed him. He would kill them mercilessly. Gradually that became a habit in their family. Before starting any business, he'd always sacrifice an animal. He believed the growth of his empire was only due to this sacrificial ritual. It started with goats and cows and he went to the extent of performing human sacrifices too. He was very superstitious. Harold Das was his younger brother. Harold was the only man whom Antony trusted. Harold. Harold! He went to Canada to study but got acquainted with international drug cartels over there and he expanded their business on foreign soil. His dream was to make Das & Co the number one drug cartel in the world. So he created a drug called Datura. It was a drug unseen, unheard of and untried in the market. They grew Datura amidst their tobacco plants. They began to manufacture it within their factory. Datura was more lethal than cocaine. Gradually its demand increased in the market. At the same time, this news was leaked to the Narcotics Control Bureau by some of his men. He threw Datura on the faces of those whom he suspected without even questioning them and killed in wild fury ruthlessly and piled them in heaps remorselessly. Even if Antony and Harold took care of managing the business at the top level they still needed someone trustworthy working at grass-root level, right? Antony's son… I raised him from the time he was a toddler. Das. Leo Das. All this hassle is because one of your men leaked the information to NCB. Have you faced any issue of this magnitude all these years? Think about my position. Can I dismiss your action as trivial? I can't show a wrong count for namesake the way you think. If you want me to release the seized Datura, one among the three of you needs to surrender. That's why I want Leo to surrender. Only if he is behind bars for a week I can remove the stash safely by silencing my higher-ups. If it gets out of hand, I can't help you, remember that. How do we trust that you'll release him in a week? If you want your stash, you've to trust me, Das. - Antony? - Is Leo there? Leo isn't here. He said he'd cross the border with the drugs. He must be at the check-post. I think he's outwitting them. Hey, who is smoking over there? Give him two tight slaps and bring him here! Tell me, sir. Yes, sir. I'm at the spot. Who is he? Move. Rest in peace! - Gabby! Start the vehicle! - Hey! Go! Load it! Hurry up. L-E-O Das is a badass He's gonna kick your sad ass L-E-O Das is a badass He's gonna kick your sad ass L-E-O Das is a badass He's gonna kick your sad ass Rest in peace! Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass Go… Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass L-E-O Das is a badass He's gonna kick your sad ass Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass He's gonna kick your sad ass Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass He's gonna kick your sad ass Hey! I worked for you risking my job but you're outwitting me and getting me in trouble? I'll see how you take the stash out without my help. Leo! Hey! Don't! Leo! Rest in peace! Leo found out who gave information to the NCB from within our camp. - Gabby! - Tell me. I don't care what bloody issue it was. Why halt and discuss en-route? You're gathering allies and mediating with so many tons of drugs at stake! Who is mediating? Go ask Daniel. Every time I instructed him, he said, "Call Leo. This load won't move an inch till he comes here and settles my share." That smart-ass threatened me. You place him on a pedestal claiming he's your friend! Where is he? What is your problem? What issue do you have to work with him? He is my problem! He has taken my place. I can't work under this mongrel. If that's what you'll do, I will hold back the drugs. I'll show you I'm important too. What do you want me to do? I don't want him butting in, that's all. If he does, we can't dispose the drugs. He asked for it. Right? I care two hoots for friendship or whatever crap other than this stash. I'll do as you say. Hey! - Remove the damn knife. - Hey! I know in which direction you'll point that gun. Put the gun down and step back. Have you watched the movie, Jeans? Hero Prashanth plays dual roles, right? A small change. Both are two men in that movie. Here, it's a man and a woman. Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass Badass, Mr. Leo Das is a badass Rest in peace Leo. It isn't easy to cross all the check-posts with 2,000 kilos of Datura overnight. Like shooting mongrels, they target our men with vengeance. It's too risky to transfer it overnight. Tell me what to do. Even though it was an almost impossible task Leo dismissed the risk of transfer overnight. Leo took it as a challenge to transfer 2,000 kilos of Datura by crossing two inter-state borders. Imagine! 2,000 kilos of Datura. It was worth millions at that time. He kept his word and finished it without any hitch. He took matters in his own hands for his dad's sake without a second thought. Amidst all this, Antony's quest for human sacrifices didn't stop. For two years, he was searching for a unique horoscope. He believed that if such a person was found and sacrificed, his tobacco factory and business would flourish. We were least bothered about this. We were happy that the drugs reached safely and celebrated with booze and dance. Bro, come here. Bro! Come on! Please. For the sake of these boys. Come on! I'm ready. Shall I make an entry? I'm your dear bro. Shall I come now? Don't taunt this lion With the sting of a scorpion No matter who tries to obstruct my route It will be the same forever I'm ready. Shall I make an entry? Your favorite bro, shall I come solo? Till the Earth quakes, beat the drum I will dance in tune to your rhythm I'll light the torch in a flick Between my fingers double quick Pick the best goat and slaughter So I can appease my hunger If God is granting total bliss in one go, caution is advisable. Because no one can predict what will happen next. I have good news and bad news for you. Only these two horoscopes will suit our purpose out of all the horoscopes I searched for, till date. Please take a look and decide. I'm ready to harvest And weed out my opponent It is our fate at stake To get rid of this headache. If he acts like Smart Alec, We will tie him in a sack Dump him in a lorry To get dissected in the factory! Hey! We know all the blueprints Our mission will be a success If you interfere, you'll also be akin To a lamb offered to our family deity Lamb for offering booze, cigarette, beedi Every buddy in our gang is trustworthy As a team we work and think Sharing a worldwide link Our rules hold good in every city Don't flick our tools to play dirty We move and groove in unity Our sync is our identity I fight world wars not just a battle Tired of winning every match I wrestle Just one drum beat quick Sure-shot power kick Power kick! I shouldn't have shown Elisa's and Leo's horoscopes to you but I had no option. I'm not sure if we can find a similar horoscope with the same star and date of birth, Das. Hey! Is there no other way? Can't you come up with any other option? I feel really sad to say this. If you ask for my opinion, I'll choose Leo. No. The decision… the decision is all yours. Garnished with spice and pepper Oh, look! It boils with a special flavor Those limbs so amazing and super Fist fight that strikes like lightning Flashes into our kitchen and dining Inviting and awakening Many a knife waiting to stab me That's their account to tally This knife is different altogether Don't you dare plan to close my chapter - Do you get it, mister? - Oh! Yes, master. I'm known by another name too You'll tremble in fear Upon hearing it, dude Print out the poster All-ready is your brother Celebrate and how! Set it ablaze now Here I am… Hey! Make way for our bro! Here I am, your dear bro. Shall I come now? Don't taunt this lion With the sting of a scorpion No matter who tries to obstruct my route It will be the same forever I'm ready. Shall I make an entry? Your favorite bro, shall I come solo? Till the Earth quakes, beat the drum I will dance in tune to your rhythm I'll light the torch in a flick Between my fingers double quick Pick the best goat and slaughter So I can appease my hunger I had to do this, Leo. Even now, between you and your sister many chose you, they opted to sacrifice you. My brother also chose you. I was the one who saved you! You need not thank me for that. Just pardon me. From my childhood till date, I've killed countless people for your sake. I took your word as gospel and killed my friend too. That was for our business. But this is mere superstition! Let go of Elisa! Leo! This is also for our business. - Understand that! - Hey! She isn't just my sister. She is my twin. A part of me, my other half! If anything untoward happens to her, no matter how many births you take the day I see you will be your last day! The day I meet you will be your last day on Earth! Are you begging him? Didn't I tell you the day our mother passed away? That he has something to do with her death. If he has decided to sacrifice his children, I don't consider him my dad anymore, none of them here are my kith and kin! Will you do me a favor, Leo? Don't spare any of them alive. Hey! Don't even think about it. Hey! Hey! Don't you dare! Let her go! Dad! Dad! Hey! Release her! Let her go! Elisa, try to understand! Understand my plight! Leo! Hey! Leo, burn down the entire factory. Harold, don't let them escape. Harold! Don't let them escape! Leo! - Come on. - Come! - Come on. - Catch… Hey! Don't spare anyone. Don't leave anything out! Burn everything down! Everything! Hey! Hey! You wanted to sacrifice your children for this, right? Hey, Leo! This shouldn't exist anymore! Hereafter this… Hey! …shouldn't exist! Leo, stop it! Hey! Throw me a knife. Elisa! Elisa… - Elisa… - Leo. Don't be with them, Leo. Elisa! Go somewhere far away. My dearest Elisa! Elisa! Elisa! I raised him. The day he collapsed and burned to his death in front of my eyes is embedded in my heart. Tell me if it's Leo in this photo. No need. If you just identify him, all the problems will be solved. Even if he stands amidst 1,000 people, I can identify Leo from his eyes. This isn't him. Don't play unnecessarily with an innocent man's life. Warden! Take me away. He is shell-shocked upon hearing one day's happenings. If he hears the entire story, he's likely to lose his life! Give it. We clicked this during third grade. This is in fourth grade. And this is in fifth grade. This is the letter he wrote to me during his college days. May I ask you something? I consider you my brother and I'm asking you this. I know what's on your mind. I won't tell him about your visit. Make sure that he doesn't find out. If he finds out, he'll be devastated. - Hello? - Sir, is this Parthiban? - Yes. - Sir, come to the coffee shop at once. It's an emergency. He was drinking with us, sir. I don't know why he kept saying that he saw his friend. He was happily drinking. He even bought booze for all the passers-by, sir. Then he left in an inebriated state. He stood on the road and spoke to someone over the phone for a long time. Then some people arrived in a car and took him away. - Was it a black car? - Yes, sir. Hey! He claimed to be your friend and came to your cafe. He sat there and chatted with you. He has even taken your photo. How do you know him? Can't you hear me? Sir! If he was a regular customer at my cafe, I should've at least been slightly upset, right? Look into my eyes. Are there tears? I don't know him, sir. How can I be responsible for him dying in front of my cafe? I'll come to the station when you call me. You can interrogate me there. I've left my little girl alone at home. I'm scared for her. I need to go. - Okay, go. - Thank you, sir. I don't know whether to feel sorry or be suspicious of Parthiban. Listen. Every human being has a limit to lie and pretend. He can do it only up to a breaking point. He can't continue to put on an act beyond that point. Because no one is mentally strong to that extent. I feel Parthiban isn't acting. He is Parthiban indeed. Beyond this, if truth has to be told, Leo, who is allegedly dead has to come in person and say it. Parthi, are you back? I heard you left in a hurry because you got a call. Where did you go? Do you know how hectic the past two days have been at work for me? Why is your dinner untouched? Parthi, what happened? Why are you sitting here quietly? Beyond this, I have nothing left to lose, dear. I'm a loser. From my fingerprints to the black pupils of my eyes, you are suspecting every part of me. - It's not like that, please... - Don't touch me! Don't touch me. This whole world can suspect me. But how could you doubt me? How did you see me as a stranger? Sathya? Oh, no! No matter what explanation you give to appease me, the fact that you suspected me will haunt me forever. Is our bond so fragile? The life that we led so far has lost its meaning. That's it, right? I am not him! Parthiban isn't that kind of a person. Despite repeating myself over and over again, just because some random chap resembles me… - What happened, Dad? - It's nothing, sweetie. I wasn't feeling well. Go to sleep. Dance for me. Oh… I've never seen anybody do the things you do before They say, move for me And when you're done, I'll make you do it all again Hey, you. Some random fellow… If they torture me claiming I resemble some random riff-raff, what can I do? You've forsaken your trust in me. My son asked me if I'm his dad. You ask me if I'm your husband! Who am I? Tell me. That's correct. I don't know who my parents are or what my place of birth is. I'm an orphan. Maybe if they were alive, they wouldn't have suspected me. I'm an orphan, after all. - Don't say that. - Just an orphan. Parthi, you're not an orphan. Look at me. I'm telling you to look into my eyes. I didn't do this due to lack of trust in you. When other people ask me, I need to tell them with certainty, right? "He is not that man." I should be able to confidently assert this is my husband, Parthiban, right? Why can't you understand? My dear. I need to ask just one question. After you suspected that I was someone else, how could you touch me with familiarity? Wouldn't you feel disgusted? The way actress Revathi says in Mouna Ragam, "I feel a hairy caterpillar is crawling all over..." Trust me. Sathya. Please trust me. I'm your Parthi, dear. Leo, the time I gave you is over. You didn't come. So I am here to see you. Look outside. Hey! Who the hell are you all? What are you doing here? You better leave! I'll shoot you all down! You won't leave this place alive! This need not have gone so far. If you had come of your own accord and admitted to me that you are Leo I wouldn't have come here now. Sir! Don't come downstairs for any reason whatsoever. I'll deal with them! I came to meet you but a mongrel is barking over here! Okay. Amidst all this, give some thought to where your son is. Sathya? Where is Siddharth? - What happened? - Where is Siddhu? - Check on Siddhu. - You won't be able to find him. - He would've reached his destination. - He isn't here! Siddharth! Bring our daughter. But your son is so damn cute. He came out to smoke, got trapped and made it easy for us. Can you hear me? Parthiban, what is happening here? Where is Siddhu? Whom are you talking to? If anyone except me enters the house, you must stab them. Why? You will do it. Hold it! Come on! Go in. Lock the door from inside, Sathya. You don't have to be Leo. But think about it. Why should I kidnap your son? Twenty-two years ago, your sister died on this very day. I'm taking your son today and you know the reason behind it. Don't you understand? I don't have a sister or any damn sibling. Let go of my son, rascal! - Sir? - You'll come on your own, Leo! - What is it? - Sir, open the door! - Sir, they have kidnapped Siddhu. - I didn't know they took him. Hey! Load your gun, sir. Sir, hold tight! Watch out! Where is my son! Answer me! Where is my son! Hey! Siddhu? Siddhu? Siddhu! My son! I failed to kill you, Leo. But I won't fail to kill your son! I'm not the man you're looking for! You're presuming I'm your son and ruining my life! Where is my son? Come on, tell me. Speak up! Where is my son? Tell me! Accept that you're my son. And I'll let your son go. Oh, God! I'm not your son! No. I'm not your son! Tell me. You're my son, right? Harold, Antony is no more. I'm bringing the boy. Napoleon needs bed-rest. I'm there, I'll take care of him. But they won't stop at this. They will come looking for you. Your son will be safe for now. We will send a task force and find him. But you shouldn't stay here. If you stay here, your life will be in grave danger. Please listen to me. I've arranged a car. It's parked at your doorstep. Collect your essentials and leave. Now! Who is this? Leo, no matter where you go and hide you know very well that I'll come and get you. All I want is your life. Don't step on my ego and lose your family. If you want your son back hand over my elder brother to me. Bring him here and take your son. Parthiban, take it. Go soon and bring back your son. Das, I've sent boss' body. We have boarded him on the train. We will reach in an hour. Sir, as per your request, I've given your brother's body. Please give my son back, I'll leave. I know, you won't believe me no matter what I say. - That's why I... - Hey! Don't be scared. This is just my son's school bag. Sir, this is my birth certificate and these are my 10th and 12th mark sheets. This is my ration card, Aadhar card and wedding photos. This was clicked during my daughter's ear piercing ceremony. This was clicked on my son's first birthday, sir. Look at this, sir. When I was in 10th grade, I took part in an oratorical contest and bagged the first prize with my speech on Kappalottiya Thamizhan. This was taken there. My name is in bold letters in the certificate. Look here. This is you and your sister on your 10th birthday. A Honey Badger had entered our tobacco field. This photo was taken after it was killed. Look how smart you look with that blood-stained face. I understand, sir. It's not wrong that you mistook me for Leo, sir. He bears a striking resemblance to me. Hey! Do I look like a fool? - Sir… - Do I seem like an imbecile? Leo. You know what I did to your twin sister. I think you haven't forgotten that. You better accept that you are Leo. Or your son will share the same fate as your twin. Sir, I don't have a sister. How do I make you understand? Siddhu? Sir. In all these years, he is scrutinizing someone for the first time. Human beings can lie. Certificates can be fake. But birds and beasts never lie. I've never seen an eagle at such close quarters in my life, sir. Ask it to step back. I'm scared, sir. Hey. This performance is just to protect your family, right? You committed a blunder even there. You came here to save your son but left your wife and your daughter all alone at home, my dear boy. Shall I ask my men to slit their throats? Hey! Okay, sir. Sir, don't harm them. Sir, please. Hey! Instruct your guys not to harm them, sir. Poor souls, sir. - Shut up! - Hush! Let's run for our lives! What's this? They have planted bombs here! - What is it, Mom? - Nothing, dear, go back to sleep. Sir, tell them not to go in. - Hey, what happened... - Sir. - Will you walk in the front? - Shut up! No, don't! Hey! He's gone. My eyes are burning! It's burning! Come with me. Hey! You climb up. What? Can you open it or not? Hey! - Sir… - Hey! Sir, at least you tell him, please. Tell them not to do anything, sir. Please, sir. Instruct them not to enter my house, please, sir. You're leaving me alone to face this! - You climb up. - Let's come back in the morning. Hey! Just climb! My side is all clear. Check those who are entering through the main door. Watch it, there could be more booby traps. Who is this? Looks like Chhota Bheem. Hey! Stupid guy, come! Hey! Sir. I killed all those who barged in except for one guy. He climbed in from the side and entered upstairs, sir. He will go to hell soon. You be safe. Hey! Hey! Are you playing the fool with me? I'll chop you into pieces! - Sir, please… - Hey! - Sir. - Why are you hanging up on me? - Sir. - What is going on there? He's no ordinary fellow, sir. He has set traps all around the house. All our men are dead. I know him like the back of my hand. I confirm, he is Leo. Who is in front of you? His wife and daughter. Shall I slit their throats open? No need. Put the phone on speaker. Give the phone to his wife. You better listen to me. - Accept that you are Leo. - Sir. I'll let them go. Parthi! Sathya, don't panic. Accept it. Subramani. Hey! I'm talking seriously here and you're laughing! Me? I think it's some rabid dog. Go away! I told you to instruct your men to not go in, sir. Poor fellows. Right, sir? Now the Leo we know will emerge. Chittu, he has to accept that he's Leo. - Don't let go of him! - Hold him tight! - Chop him! - Don't let go of him. Chop him into pieces! Chop him! Hey! Stay with his son. Hey! I used this to kill your sister… Now I realise you are not Leo. You are Parthiban. Now I believe you. You are not the one whom I was looking for. Let's call it quits. What do you say? Drop your gun. Hey! Lower your gun. Lower it. Hey! Either shoot it or drop it, scoundrel! Let go! Leo… Leo! Leo! - If I'm sweet, you're bloody sweet, Uncle. - Hey! I should've killed you on that fateful day, right? The mistake was mine. Now go to hell! Leo… Was this necessary for you? "I want to see Leo. I want to find Leo." Didn't you ask? See me now. Leo… Drop your gun. Check if there are any vehicles outside. If a person's past has to be quoted often he should've done something good. I have done no good deed. In my past, knowingly or unknowingly, I have committed many crimes. The last chance I got to reform myself is this family of mine. I will go to any extent to protect this family. The man called Leo is dead. If I have to convince this town and the people around of his demise first I have to believe it myself. Leo is dead. I believe it. How are you? No matter how many people come and ask me if I'm Leo, I'll convince them too. Despite that, if someone insists on knowing my story, he should either die the next minute or already be dead. Of course I'm Leo. Leo Das! My life is in this town And I ain't going down You think that I'm crazy But I don't want the crown My life is in this town And I ain't going down You think that I'm crazy But I don't want the crown Just an ordinary person Yeah I'm just a peace-loving soul I'm just an ordinary person, yeah! I'm just a peace-loving soul Peace loving soul My life is in this town I came here and said that I'm not Leo. No one believed me. They hit me. Finally they accepted that I'm not Leo. Other than this, nothing happened. Promise me that you won't tell your mom what happened here. You promise me you won't tell mom that I smoke. I'm just an ordinary person! Yeah I'm just a peace-loving soul I'm just an ordinary person! Yeah! I'm just a peace-loving soul Peace loving soul - Who scratched your face, Dad? - Keep quiet. Siddhu, switch on the TV. I'm a wicked man, so ruthless I never lie, I confess I'm a wicked man I think the main door isn't locked. I'll go and lock it. I never harbor any grudge in my heart Hello? Just because you destroyed a single Datura factory do you think all your problems got solved, Parthiban? Oh! I'm sorry. Leo. If you want to make this society drug-free, there are lots more left throughout India to be burnt down, Leo. Do you recognize my voice? He is a badass, deadly!
