Maybe I imagined it all Maybe no one will believe me But... this is how it all happened... My husband died last year I know he came back to see me but I haven't seen him since Why won't he come back? Spirits linger for many reasons In your case... his spirit had unfinished business He came to see you one last time before he could let go Then he left Madame Qi I really miss him I have a lot to talk to him Can I see him once more? Please help me, Madame Qi To begin with... hanging wind chimes near the bed... whistling at midnight or standing in a corner... will attract wandering spirits There might be one beside you now To beckon the spirit of your beloved There are two ways One... act as if he never left you Eat with him, talk to him as before Do the things you enjoyed together Soon your love will reach him on the other side and guide him back to you The second way is more extreme Make him angry with you Do what he hated most when he was alive Make him so mad that he has to return Make him feel needed Honey Midnight snack time... Our favorite, instant noodles Don't worry about getting fat I like you fat Eat with me? I overcooked them No wonder you're not eating You always cook them perfectly Let's have some wine? I bought this bottle for our anniversary I can't even open a wine bottle without you Honey Come help me open this? Honey I can't open this without you I'm useless You like the house neat and tidy? It'll stay a mess if you don't come back! Come back or I'll trash everything! You hate it when I smoke? Look, I found cigarettes! Honey Honey! Please come back to me? Honey Did I skip dinner last night? I'm starving! Honey Can you come help me? I feel dizzy Do I have the flu? Rest a little, you'll be fine It's cute! You bought this? You bought it You bought it with Mu-mu Mu-mu? Mu-mu is our son Our son Mu-mu... Is he in school? You found your way here I'm impressed Madame Qi? I think I know why you're here My wife's spirit has returned But she has forgotten many things Spirits are souls without life All spirits have consciousness and form When a spirit lingers for too long it fades away as its consciousness and form dissipate But don't worry, her memory will slowly return But remember You need to be aware of a few things One... only those who love her can see her So never let her go outside Two... some spirits don't know that they're a spirit Don't let her know Otherwise, she'll fade more quickly What should I do now? Help fulfill her last wishes This way, both of you... will have no regrets What will you do to my son? Son... he's locking at me suspiciously Papa is going to let him try his first... lemon - No, no, no... - Be brave - Be brave... - Don't... Don't cry, my baby... I know, Papa is bad Papa is a bad man Papa is bad... All right... It's okay... What's today? Wish Mama a Happy Mother's Day! Happy Mother...s Day... I love you, Mommy!

We play "Hello Stranger" once a year You don't remember? So do you want to know... what "Hello Stranger" is? Just promise... not to interrupt and trust me Okay? Okay Kai-fang! But first, I need to tell you a story In my first year of university there was a girl... homely and short She followed me... every day Look, your "girlfriend" is here! Take her... No, thanks... During piano practice... she'd spy on me from outside That's cute Cute? It was creepy She was there even when I took a leak What the hell? - Someone's out there! - Who? I expected it to last maybe one semester But she stalked me for 3 years Mr. Ling... Kai-feng! She was like a ghost... haunting me... She followed me everywhere Killing all my chances with other girls Then I should thank her Why? For keeping you single But seriously... 3 years It's scary to even think about You think she's scary? That girl was you! Impossible! Wait, did you say... llhomelyll? Let me finish... Who did you say was homely? After three years of this nightmare... suddenly there was a change During my senior year spring break I stopped seeing you around When I was playing piano... Jogging... or in the toilet... you weren't there You simply vanished I began to change I soon realized... I missed you One day a classmate asked me to check out a pretty girl When I looked... I saw it was you! How dare he to date my girl? What's going on? I asked her out first! Get lost! She's mine! You need to know... you were an ugly duckling no one noticed Suddenly you had the attention of all the boys As more and more guys... tried to woo you I decided... to confess to you There's something... I wanted to ask you Why don't we... But before I could finish... - No! I wouldn't do that! - Don't deny it - You're like that - No! I'm reserved You're the type that says "yes" to whatever I ask... then regret it later At our wedding you made me vow before the minister... to say "I love you" once a day and play "Hello Stranger" once a year What exactly is "Hello Stranger"? "Hello Stranger" is a game A game In this game, you and I... we don't know each other so I get to chase you all over again To make up for... not chasing you earlier That sounds nice It's a fun game - Let's play it now - Sure Get changed What for?
