(triumphant orchestral music) [Narrator] Alcana, a thin town on the dotted line between Mexico and Israel. A rustic place where miners named Al mine natural tin cans from the bottom of placid Lake Rust. Alcana, the kind of town where a kid can grow up dragging around dead fish at the end of a string, and carrying a pointed stick over his shoulder. Yes, it seemed like just another thin normal day in Alcana when little Al heard something out of the ordinary. (sexual moaning and grunting) [Man] Oh gosh, that was wonderful. [Woman] I'll go wash up, Big Al. You write a check. [Man] Shall I make that in pesos or shekels, Alice? [Woman] Suit yourself. [Man] Oh, you've got the big melons. [Narrator] Alcana, a thin town on the dotted line between, wait a minute, I already said that. Alcana, where the Mounties are brave and the braves are mounted and on display in the Dead Indian Museum just off Tin Can Alley, home of the Mexican mounted policia. Help, help, Sergeant Al, Sergeant Al! What is it, Little Al? It's Big Al, Sergeant Al. Calm down, you little turd. Part of him was all shriveled up, and he looked like he spilled something on his pants. And Miss Alice was putting on her dress and sipping vinegar and water. - Big Al? - He's not big now. Okay, little fart, we better do something about this. You know, they may have become tick-infested. Gosh, ticks? Uh, yucky. See now, how do you start this thing? Oh yeah, okay, here we go. Hi-ho, horsepower, away! [Narrator] It was too late for Big Al, the ticks got him, but Sergeant Al got his hands on Alice just in time. [Sergeant] Ticks were hiding in holes all over your body, Alice, some as big as marbles. (burping) Are we eating, man, or playing cards? Don't talk to me into deal me a deck of salami. Hello, Alice, how's your finger? Fine. And I know how your hands, still doing your hair with that waffle iron, I see. Want a room? Actually, we're trying to get Alice here out of the woods. We had to sluice those ticks off of her with a high pressure hose. We never have ticks, only termites. That's why I run a house. Have you got a room for one more girl, huh? Well, we just don't take anybody off the streets. You call that ditch a street? I suppose to your kind it's no more than a dotted line. She needs a job. We only got one room open right now. It's the all electric one. And I don't think you're qualified, it's not easy. You have to work with rubber sheets. You must be kidding, Kate. I got a better gimmick than that and I got it in my purse. I know it isn't much of a purse. But at least it isn't filled with ticks, except for that one. I killed it, okay? And here's your thing. Hm. Hey Al, look at this. Chinese sex coin. It's been used recently, There's a nice hole in it. Memento Katie, let me see. I once used a coin like this a long time ago in a whorehouse across the street in Mexico. I don't much remember what happened that night, but I'm sure I had a real good time. Will you give her a bed and a room, she could bring it a shitload of business. [Piano Al] Yeah Katie, sign her up. Hit me with an eighth of spam Jose. [Katie] Well, I guess I'll take a chance. But this whole looks too small for Israelis or Mexicans. Okay Alfredo, turn on el switcho out and we'll test her out, contact. There, it's all set now. Now see, you're gonna be the girl and I'll be the guy, see. [Alfredo] Okay Mister Herpes. Everything is set now. Here, give me your thing. Now see, you walk up all excited. I do, and I kiss you. And then you just push open the door like this. And the frets are flying, the pinwheels are going, and you think you're in love. Boy, I think I'm gonna use this room tonight myself with Alice. Oh, she'll think she's in Wonderland. Go on, turn it off. Save some for me. This'll be the biggest money maker in the house. [Narrator] The next day the Mounties discuss the mountings of the night before. No, I've dipped the wick lots of times. That's how I got these stripes on my arm. I'd give anything for some stripes. Instead, they just sewed my hand into my pocket like this, and I'm afraid to pull it out. Otherwise, I wouldn't hesitate to jump on Alice myself. Al, I thought you liked having your hand in your pants. No, I'd rather have it in your pants. Oh, hello Doctor Al. Sergeant Al, I have something here you should know about. What is it Al? It's about Miss Alice. We did an analysis of the ticks on her tits, and guess what? I give up? Well, here's what we found. According to our analysis, some of these ticks are suffering from Mexican-Israeli herpes. Signed A for Al friend. A friend? I've heard of him, but I've never heard of this guy Herpes before. Why, he's the first John I balled in the all-electric room. But I don't understand, what's the problem? Is this guy Herpes, sick? Worse than that. I'll go over and talk to the geek. I'll try to keep them from spreading the infection to other ticks in the neighborhood. Back for more, Sergeant Allie? Not today, Kate. Andale, I got a bologna flush. I got a full house, a pair of pastrami's, and three slices of a Turkey. Holy cajones. I eat it. Hi Herpes. Bye bye. A nervous tick told me you got a vetinarial disease. I don't speak the lingo, Mexicano. Besides, I always wear these gloves, playing rough or playing with myself. So he likes to play rough, huh? Well, I'm Greek you know, I've got a hot head. Yeah, that's probably why you get ticked off so easily. And why you're wearing that hat? What hat? The hat you're wearing to hide those little suckers in your hair, ticks so sick they could infect us all. Ha ha ha smart boy, real observant. Only you forgot one thing. I ain't the only one around here wearing a hat. (Laughing) Out of the way, smoky burrito. Hey! Are you saying that Alice tricked me into ticks, too? Hey, what's the knife for? Hey, cut out that shit, boys. If you want to get rid of herpes, you gotta cut 'em out. Let me have your knife. Hey, I'm an Israeli Mexican. (confused yelling) (grunting) Till the dog grabbed the rights on the side of the street. Herpes! (slugging) (speaking in foreign language) Mexico, Mister Herpes. You can't do this to me, my ticks have rights. They're Israeli ticks, and if I bathe in Mexican water, it'll kill 'em. Take him away. [Herpes] Hell, it'll kill me. Come on Alice, let's go see how many horses it'll take the school to screw in an electric (muffled). [Narrator] Herpes and his ticks were incarcerated in the Alcana can for the rest of their unnatural lives. That incredible romantic, Sergeant Al, married Alice and moved to America, where the story of herpes spread far and wide, leading us to wonder if we can ever expect to see the end to this story, and this dramatic award-winning narration. Oh, here she is, gents. Take off your hats and show her you've got hair. Dudes, I'd like you to mate, meet, Miss Carriage. Fine group of boys, Dad. Show me their stuff. You can count on it, baby. These guys have got a sperm count that won't stop. As you know this process is not yet recognized by the other dorks in the profession. Nevertheless, when someone like Miss Carriage, comes to me, complaining that she can't have any children in the so-called normal way, that's when I turn my medical certificate to the wall, and go to a hands-on method I've developed working long and hard into the night. We know you're a quack, Doctor Herr Palmer, but a brilliant quack. Ah yes, and as a quack, I've had to duck a lot of what's coming down, but you paid your money Miss Carriage, now make your choice. [Miss} The thing that erected itself there, is that where they place their donating services? No ma'am, it's a shape reminiscent of the classic female figure, and is known as the sperm exciter. Now keep your eyes on that flask, boys. [Man] I recognize that doc, took me a whole weekend at Club Med to come up with that sample. (Laughing) [Doctor] Now this device will measure the level of seed excitation, or as we say in the business, sperm dancing. [Miss] Oh my. Look at those numbers, Miss Carriage. We're talking Saturday Night Fever, here. [Man] Hey doc, look at those little buggers boogie. That's my throttle in the bottle, baby. I can shake it and I can break it. (confused yelling) [Man] Bring security back. Some of those wigglies are in the Wrigley building next door. [Man] That's the seed that does the deed, huh doc? Well, doc, it looks like I got the stuff that's tough enough. Do I get the job? Yes, you can make a partial deposit at my sperm bank tomorrow morning. Great, I'll be up before the cock crows. I'm next, I'll give it the office. Call me, doc. Thank you studly, thank you Bates. Thank you, Doctor Herr Palmer. Miss Carriage. [Miss] Give it your best shot, Mister Bates. There's more where that came from, baby. This sperm bank hoax is really nowheresville. Wrong again, Inspector Dolly. Look who just made a deposit at the don't tell her window at First Semen Sperm Bank. It's Richard Nixon. I'd know those jowls anywhere. And see, he's got his hand in his pocket. He looks a little overdrawn, sir. Hmm Hmm. And those others too, look, Kissinger, Andropov, Arafat, Ronald McReagan. This is serious. Every power hungry bigwig in the world wants to replicate himself. We gotta stop 'em. We're the OSS, the Office of Sperm Stoppers. And it's our duty to act now, or in 20 years, the kid next door will be Richard Nixon. I want you to get on it right away. I'd rather get on Dolly. All right, move along. You can dial me in now, no AT and T, I come direct. Here I come, whoa. What the hell, this stinks. Okay now, look at your boobies. Ha, now look at the chief boobie. (Laughing) Hey, you're looking swell through that pelt Drag Lady. Welcome Evilness. What's the weather like on Mars? Dust storms, dust storms, always the same. I didn't fly all the way from Mars to get hounded about the weather. Look, I'm a little guy with a big problem and your sexy little pointers can help me. Parts of your limpness have reached us. Darling, I've devised a plan to populate this planet with wicked little snots like you. Collect the seed of a jerk like me. Then mix his sperm with mine to propagate the Earth. That's bad. So long, dull bee. I just lean back for the big crib. I put my hand over the family jewels, and away we go. Smoking again, I just had an oil change on this feshtugana machine. Well, this is typical. She would want this wig, the one I was gonna wear tonight to the glory hole ball. Oh, well. Your mask and your wig, Drag Lady. Thank you handsome darling. [Man Voiceover] That hairdo. It looks like something you'd buy at a German bakery. Well, I'll just go get a tan at the club, sit on a stick, and I'll go to the ball as a fudgesicle. [Lady Voiceover] I am going to try and look like this Valley Girl picture. Let's see, well maybe a nice, smooth rubber complexion will make me an All-American. Good, for sure. No, I'm totally perfect client for Doctor Herr Palmer's like clinic. Really, for sure, awesome. Come on in Miss Sharper. Howdy Doody? Welcome to the wonderful world of wigglies. For sure, but 30,000 bucks to get knocked up. Like, I mean gag me with a spoon. Yeah, it's grody to the max. But business is business. We have a special today on rock singers and geniuses. You can have Robert Plant or Albert Einstein, David Bowie or Linus Pauling, Ozzy Osborne or Robert Oppenheimer, Mick Jagger or Jonas Salk. Or maybe are in the market for something a little more adventurous, like a mixture of Clint Eastwood and Larry Flynt. Would you like to have a little Clint Flynt? Get your sticky fingers out of this sperm safe, Doctor Herr Palmer. Moon, this is awesome. Go shit in your hat, Doc. Move the smock. Let's see. John Travolta. [Doctor] You're wasting my wigglies. [Miss] Sylvester Stallone. Steve Martin. Tricky Dicky. [Man Outside] Come on Doc, open up, or I'll have to give through the keyhole. Ah, that'll do it. Come here, Uncle Wiggly. (dramatic orchestral music) - [Drag Lady Voiceover] - Here, I'm all set. His Evilness will be so pleased. I've transferred Tricky Dicky's little (muffled) into this high ball. I inject it into the boner of a good looking donor, and then he'll inject it in me. Now all I have to do is stick the needle up his little vazo and then just. (screaming) Give me the needle. Give me that spike, Florence Nightmare Gale. I didn't know you were into needles. That's not my scene Doc. This babe was trying to inseminate me. I don't know what inseminate means. Return this stuff to the ex-president. Gosh, that's gonna be painful. He screwed us for six years, now it's our turn. Take her away. [Drag Lady] When His Evilness (muffled) you'll be walking a beat on Mars. Since you're halfway into your jammies, how about booking a room? Look what you do in intensive care. This could be intense. Hello honey? I'll be working late at the office. Something big has come up. (dramatic orchestral music) I just love whipping big guys like you. Like that? Lower. Lower? How's that? Lower, kraut. How's that? It's all good. Now I'm going to get you a little bit lower. How about that? And one more! No, no, this is getting us nowhere fast. Look I tell you, there's only one way to treat these non-smokers. Just blowing a little pipe smoke right in this face. Here, take some of this. No. What's the matter? Don't you like my special mix, almond trail bars. Sit down here. Do you admit you filter information to the non-smoking resistance? No way, Call Corporal Galwas. (speaking in foreign language) And carry your whip in the other hand. Sorry sir. Good sadists are hard to find. Ah, Galwas. Touch your hat and wave hello! Now Galwas, look carefully at his mouth. What do you see? There are no stains on his pretty teeth. This man is Butt Buster. What? Can you say Butt Buster? Butt Buster? Guess you can't. This is a smoking state and these prigs who won't smoke cigs burn me up. You're right. If I had my way I'd blow the whole pack away with a smoking pistol. Okay, we'll start off the day with a bang, and shoot him at dawn. Tell him you'll teach him a lesson. I'll teach you a lesson. Now here's a tricky one. Herr Simon says click your heels, touch your head, and bugger off. (mumbling) (speaking in foreign language) Idiots. Look at these warning papers he was trying to smuggle in. There's a riddle printed on here. What's pink on the inside, and black on the outside, and black on the inside, and pink on the outside. A smoker's lungs. This isn't funny and I don't get it so it must be dangerous. You're am imbecile. With that uniform you ought to go back to jockeying elevators and let me handle this myself. Herr Buster, want to wear (muffled) with this hanky? I guess you don't want a cigarette, huh? - A cigar? - No. - Hookah? - No. Do you chew? Uh oh, guess I'd better get out of the way. Smokers, and, fire! (Guns firing) (grunting) (farting) See, non-smoking can be hazardous to your health. Easy boys, he's precious to me. Oo la la, all right, open your eyes and smile. Now show me your butt, buster. Those buns are good enough to eat. The bullets bounced off you. You have lungs of steel. Comes from not smoking, and I don't play with myself either. We're going to transport you to California, in non-smoking zone where you'll be completely safe. Hot dog. Except for the smog. Did you notice how sweet my breath smells? Yes, and you have the gums of a six year old. Kiss me you fool. (train whistle blowing) (dramatic orchestral music) (humming) Excuse me Amos, but is it legal to smoke my pipe in here? We're in a drug state Mister Benny, controlled substances is okay. Mm-hmm. (muffled singing) Have you got any hash? Oh yes, for sure. Butt Buster! Shit! (grunting) Are you on meth, angel dust? (yelling and grunting) You idiot, get away from me. I'm going to whip your ass with this. (Laughing) (confused yelling) There you go. You mean I have to stick fingers in your lungs, but you have fingers all over your body! Mind if I cut in? Time for you to cut out. Hey buddy, you look a little hung over. Must've been that punch, huh? Come inside, this way, through the door. Herr Fatso couldn't handle his smoke. And I handle myself. You're talking to Captain Smoke Stopper. Really? You're putting me on. I'll prove it. This is the ring I got for not smoking in the bathroom at Saint Nicotine's, just like yours. That's right, Butt. Captain Galwas told us all about you. And I read all about you in the straight people's weekly, didn't I? I wrote the story, and I took the picture in one of those booths for a quarter. And I named myself Captain Smoke Stopper, so I'd never forget to remember my name. What? I'm leading the war against smokers in the United States. Well, I don't know if you've noticed it, but you could be my twin brother. Yeah, you keep your good looks when you don't smoke. So what do we do now? That's up to you. Would you like to help us? I don't know. I kind of like riding around in trains like this by myself, getting stoned. Wouldn't you like to help us bust up the smoke-easies? Well sure if I could get a cape and goggles like yours. So you like my drag? Really, they're bitching threads. Bet you have to beat off the girls. Nah, I handle myself. So the real problem is breaking up those secret smoke-easies all over the country. Yeah, and you could start by breaking up the Acme Cafe. Okay Buster, this ain't a library. Order up or get out. I'll have the unsmoked turkey and the decaf coffee. Got it. Dead gobbler and sissy java for the wimp at table three. Well am I glad I'm a union thug, I get a smoke break. (mumbling) Oh, I can hardly wait. Hey, hi ya low tar. Hi, kidney foot. You have a licorice stick of anise? Yes, yes I do sir. Here you go but keep it on the QT. Hey, who you calling a cutie, you king size bag. I'll crush your butt. It means you have to smoke in the back. That's all right. I'll do anything to smoke one of these cigars. The cough clears out my lungs, but best of all I get to litter. - [Buster Voiceover] - Buying a cigar with intent to smoke it in a phone booth. He'll get the death penalty for that. Gonna go bust him right now. I'll just act real casual. Prepare to be busted mister cigar sucker. Hey, he's gone. Oh, just like Ma Bell. Rest her dear sweet soul. This is a great cigar. I'd like to take a case of these home with me. I've got a smoking bunker in the backyard. Coming up. One case of Comrade Castro's Coronas to go. This is heavy leaf. Oh boy, this is as exciting as getting under that sweater back in high school. My first bust, I'll call the ciggy SWAT team. Hope that's my mistress. I haven't had a hot one in weeks. Hello, snookums speaking. (heavy breathing) Oh, Butt Buster. Chief, I'm at the Acme Cafe. It's a smoke-easy, 774 477. - East Street. - West Street. The smoke screeners are on the way. Now I'm gonna bust his ash. (coughing) I can smell that cigar smoke through the paneling. Yeah, this is just like the movies. Holy smokes. The feds must've sniffed us out. Thank God, I've got this cute little smoking hat. Don't want to get nicotine in my hair. Okay everybody, shake your butts, you're under arrest. Drop that tray, kidney foot. Here's your food to go, G man. Better tell the boys. Check the phone for a dime. Here we go, low tar. Hey, time to give up the habit. Hey, it's a raid. I'm going back to my wife. I'm going back to her, too. Hey, watch the goggles in my hair. Put those shoulder pads into it boys, break it down! Another smoke easy extinguished. (dramatic orchestral music) Sir, two geeks in rented clothes to see you, sir. Hm, you with the greasy hair, touch your head. Surgeon General, what we have to say is private. Go suck your gun in the hall. Sir, preparing to suck, sir. My name is Corporal Galwas. We're with the smoking underground and we've come a long, long way. Hm hm hm hm. Him, too? Him? He's the famous Butt Buster who raided the Acme Cafe. [Buster] Frenchy look, he's sucking a stogy. (yelling) Oh gosh, the Surgeon General is dangerous to our health. Now we can get smoking ads back on the tube and flood the country with just what it needs, a good $5 Cuban cigar. I'll light this one up on this handy ransom that Fidel sent me. [Narrator] And so the war between the smokers and the non-smokers goes on. And the final outcome is still hidden from us, shrouded in the clouds. Hey, who's smoking in here? Hey, you're under arrest. (dark jazz music) [Woman] Good morning ladies, and welcome to your first day at the concentration beauty camp of Beverly Hills. You give us your concentration, and we'll give you a beautiful bill. Now that you're all sufficiently warmed up, let's shake the hair spray out of our wigs. Uh huh. Now, we're ready to begin our autoerotic aerobics.

Where this boss? We must have come out the back door. This looks like the Malibu ghetto. No trendy restaurants, no fast cars, let's go. - Come on Queenie. - All right. Wow, smell that smell. Somebody frying pigs on there, see? That's my number one restaurant. Just run over that cliff, eh? Smells good, brother. I could go for a real Nouvelle cuisine meal, you know. Those big prices and little portions, I love that. That's the diet for me. I know a quiche stand, where they won't even let you in unless you're wearing a thousand dollars worth of jewelry. We'll send brother for reservations. Do you know, you're my kind of guy. You two suck face for appetizers. I'm gonna get me a dead pig and a mystery drink with a tiny umbrella. Da kine. And I get to keep the monkey mug. I can hardly wait. (Screaming) [Narrator] Table for two! (dramatic orchestral music) [Narrator] A secret toy factory, somewhere in Grenada. Doc, working for this pirate toy company is a bitch. Even worse than that fat bastard, Santa Claus, Except for all that great reindeer meat. Blitzen was really horny. Look busy, I think I hear the boss. [Man Outside] They're all afraid of the pirate toy king. Hi, Captain Kitty. Sleepy and I are as busy as little elves working on your latest rip off. I've gone to great expense and danger to steal these plans from the world's biggest toy companies. What have you got to show me? You're probably gonna pretend to hit me when I tell you. See, you're is predictable as my new invention here. And what do you call that over there? Is that a real plane? Boy, are you an idiot. It's too small to be a real plane. [Sleepy] It's a model. It's a model, and the kids are gonna love it. Sleepy, get the radium battery pack, which by the way is not included. Yeah, and it's not rechargeable either. Once the kids use it up, their folks will have to buy another. Just plug in and easily breakable cable, which is also extra. And here she goes. [Sleepy] Here she goes. [Pirate] Nothing's happening. Yes, because pie for brains here forgot to turn the controller around. And captain, the swivel stand's extra too. What do you think, huh? Clever, huh? I like it. And so with the little recorded pilot's voice we've added. Listen to it speak. Come on, come on, speak. Come on boy, Sleepy. Pilot to kid, pilot to kid, do you read me? Cleared for take off. You're my co-pilot, cadet. I'm counting on you to keep me flying. [Pirate] How does the radium make it fly? Radium? You just fall off the cabbage truck? It's the little wires attached to the wings that keep it in the air. And those are extra too. You're doing great, little lieutenant. You could become a cruise missile pilot. [Sleepy] Just as the kid gets really hooked, the battery runs out. [Plane Pilot] Mayday mayday, oh you killed me you little shithead. The kids will have to buy a new plane, a new pilot, and a new battery pack. What will the radium do to the kids? Who knows, it could turn them into old men overnight, or they could stay young forever. What do you want, I'm not a liar. I'll write a disclaimer at once in Japanese. (Laughing) The toy company gave us this toy detector. How does it work? Karl Marx, the president of Marxist toys, explained it to me. It's a radium sensitive toy detector Barbie, but you're a girl and it's probably too complicated for you. So it'd be a waste of my time to try to explain what these two arrows mean. It's a toy detector, - it's only a toy. - Wrong. That's what you told me, Ken. Give me a break, Barbie. You told me it's a toy detector, and we got it from the toy company. So it's gotta be just a toy. Barbie, stick to looking pretty, and let me handle this. What did you say? (ominous music) [Barbie] How does your tiny little toy act now, Ken? It indicates there's a little tin drum around here, somewhere and a hole on it's side. Yeah, it's the entrance to a cave. You think it's just a toy cave? Very funny, Barbie. I don't know why the detective agency assigned you to this job with me. It's not even technical (muffled speaking). (beeping) Our stolen toy should be right about here. Very good children, ha ha ha ha ha. I knew those dupes at Marxist Toys would send a couple of windup stooges after me. Want to play a game? You try to shoot me before I close the window. (gun firing) Ha ha, release the silly putty from the storage vat. (laughing) Uh oh, let's roll. There's nothing silly about that putty. (screaming) Ken, look at those ugly shoes. Oh drop it will ya? [Barbie] If that silly putty hits us, it'll bounce our brains out. That shouldn't bother you any. [Barbie] Another hole in its side. (gasping) Good Ken, you kept your hat on. [Ken] It's the hatpin through my brain. Oh, it's a pirate's life for me. With those toy ticks out of the way I can try out the prototype I just stole from the Japanese, a toy electric toy-toy. This is the flusher here. Oh whoa whoa whoa. I'll be the Steven Spielberg of the bathroom. (Laughing) Oh ho, boom boom. I lock the children in the room. One, two, three, four. Let's follow the key that can open the door. I'm having so much fun. Okay, Sailor Bill, drop the gun. It's only a toy. I was only playing. [Ken] But this is no game, Popeye's. I'm here for the children of the world. [Old Man] They're in the other room, watching commercials. Take me to Captain Kitty or I'll blow your nuts off. Surprise, I'm here. (confused yelling) Get him Bill. Get your hands off my tie. Oh my hat. Now let's see if I can get his head off with this letter opener. Wait, I've got a much more commercial idea in mind for this bozo. He's wearing the perfect costume. We'll take him in the back, stuff his suit with cotton, and put lead in his shoes. You mean you're gonna take him out and dump him in the ocean? No, we'll market him as a punching doll, the kind kids can kick around all day. Ah, you're a genius boss. He'll never lose his hat. He'll be out for Christmas time. Pick him up. Oh he's a heavy bozo. How does he keep his hat on anyway? Same way I do, never washed his hair. (Laughing) Break out the rum. (dramatic orchestral music) Ken's wet footprints lead right to this door. Oh dear, I wonder if he's going back into the closet. (muffled singing) What's this? (gun firing) Take that, toy man. Barbie, you did it. [Barbie] Is that real blood? You killed the pirate with his own tight gun. So you've killed Captain Kitty. Good work Barbie, you'll save the company the expense of a hanging. Let's tell Ken. This is for you and Sleepy. I, Karl Marx, sole owner of Marxist Toys, hereby assign Doc and Sleepy the job of making Ken and Barbie America's most popular new dolls. Thank you, Mister Marx, sir. These two will be sleeping in every kid's bed before next Christmas. Just think of our wardrobes, Ken. Great Barbie, I can get out of this 40's drag at last. Well, get the lead out of your feet and put your hat on. You're the next Cabbage Patch Kid. (dramatic orchestral music) Here I am on the back lot, directing my first film for Paranoid Pictures. And they didn't even give me a limousine. Oh, look a Jackal. I thought they all lived in Beverly Hills. Didn't I see him eating with his agent at MGM? Or was he eating his agent? Well, here's where I get off, high above the most famous intersection in Tinseltown, the corner of Hollywood and, where's the vine? That king's landing was really rough. I took a fall, but I landed on my chest and the padding saved me. That was lucky. Too bad she didn't land on her head. Can the wise cracks. I would like to get in your can. That's funny, there's nobody here. But his manager promised he'd be on time. Set the camera here. Hello hello hello, I'm sorry I'm late, but I went to the pot this morning, huh? He stinks. What's the matter, did I say something dirty? Hope I'm not getting myself in hot water. Hey, look, I love you people. Hey, come on back. Who were you expecting, Richard Pryor? What are you getting so steamed up about? But seriously, I'm hoping to get a big part in this picture. My contract has two claws in it. Claws, get it? Come on lady, laugh it up. I may have a thick shell, but I'm thin-skinned. All right, here's one for you. What's black and white and red all over? A lobster in an old movie. Hey where is everybody? This guy's dynamite, I've got to tell the producer. George, Mister Lupus, I found him. What a business. You gotta do everything for yourself. I'll just get the film out of this camera, get it down to the lab and get it developed. I'm gonna be a star or eat myself. (crowd murmuring) Get the lights, would you Judy? Director person's work is never done. Ready Mister Paranoid. You're gonna love this. I'd better George, or you're through in the business. We just tested this boy this morning. Talk about a body, what a hunk. Sorry I'm late, but I went to the pot this morning, huh? (laughing) Are we doing the Julia Child show? This is hot. [Judy] He cracks me up. (laughing) That's it boss, what do you think? What a skilled actor. You've pulled us out of the frying pan, sweeties. He's awesome. He's boffo box office. He'll be bigger than Burt Reynolds. Or Redford. Does he have a toupee? Can he ride a horse? It doesn't matter. It's his first picture, and we can get them for peanuts, or old fish heads. What do you think? What about your star, Lance Thrust. Dump him. Kick him off the lot. We'll write them out of the script. That standup lobster is gonna save this turkey. I'll go talk to the lawyers. Hey Maury, look at this big wheels car. Common Jeeper. You'll have five of them when this picture hits, You'll be a star and get to keep the hat. Keep the hat? Oh boy. Come on in. Hello Lance. I'm George Lupus. Don't shake, Lance. Not until I sign. Hold on just a second there boys. I got some news for you. We got some news for you too, Mister Hollywood Hot Shot. Well Lance, before we go any further with this meeting, we got a little problem. If you're talking about the script, that nude orgy scene with Lance and the monkeys has got to go. It's bad for my monkey's image. Now, just a minute. The monkey's are staying, Maury. And it's your client lover boy here, who's gonna take a little walk, see. Is that so? That's all she wrote. Well, I got 10% of this boy and I say he stays. Oh yeah? Well, I say he's through, and I want that hat back. Hand it over. This could be a deal breaker. And here's a jawbreaker. (slugging) (grunting) Now, take that hat back to wardrobe, and get that out. Not your hat anymore. Judy, bring the crew over here. Coming, coming Mister Lupus. Come on boys. What's up George? These two bozos are off the picture. Stencil new names on their chairs and parking places, you get me? We'll give them to Robbie and his manager, and we could use their trailer too. We'll have to fill it with saltwater for the lobster. Lobster? You mean you're replacing my gorilla with a lobster. That Robbie be our main man. You heard the chief, grip. We're going with a lobster and that's all there is to it. So smell your fingers and get outta here. [Narrator] Interior writer's bungalow, and there's a knock on the door. A brilliant, misunderstood writer, F Stock Fitzgerald, rises, picks up his, hides his whiskey and says, come in. Come in. [Narrator] The director and producer enter. The director, she looks at him longingly, and the producer says, Fitzgerald, I was just writing this scene, you came in right on cue. I'm afraid I've got some big news for you. I'm going with a lobster. It's the most important decision in my life. So you're going with a lobster. Well, your dating habits are no concern of mine, but if you want another rewrite on this piece of jungle rot, because of some piece of tail you picked up at dinner, you're sadly mistaken Mister Big Shot producer. Sure, I could take a shot at it, but I'd rather I'd take a powder. Rewrite, rewrite, I'm sick and tired of rewrites. (grunting and slugging) You didn't even read my beautiful monkey orgy scene. I'll tell you it's a knockout. Fade in, two monkeys writhing on the table, and pull Leslie to the floor. It was a scene with punch! Here, take a seat, Mister Lupus and I'll read it to you. On second thought, maybe I can sell this to Paramount. It's in turnaround. [Judy] This writer's on a bad trip. Judy, look out you broke his glass of vodka. That stuff's deadly. Another minute in here and we'll both be alcoholics. Ooh, what is that stuff? Old generic brand aged on the shelf? Maybe in shock, the tragic genius fades out. - That was a bad scene. - Yeah. Well here's the location, George, but where's Robbie? Oh, these stars are all the same. Maybe he's camera shy. He could be afraid to come out of his shell. Yeah, just what we need, a yellow lobster. Well maybe he's just got a case of cold feelers. Help me, help me, help. Oh, hi fellas. Hey, help me out of here, this is the pits. I mean, I don't want to make an underground film. You know what I mean? How the mighty have fallen, and how, huh? Hey, let me out of here and I'll tell you the one about the rabbi and the lobster going to the whorehouse. You know Lance, I'm getting kind of hungry. What do you say to a New Jersey lobster bake. [Robbie] Hey, my makeup's gonna start running. Good idea. Wish we had had some giant clams. [Robbie] Hey, this is not my good side. Hey, dishing the dirt. Big ears of corn and seaweed. [Robbie] Hey, what's going on up here? Getting covered isn't covered in my contract. I have heard about getting buried in this business, but this is ridiculous. Come on, we're not making Dune here, fellas. This is lobster minute. Come on. What's going on up there? Lunch is over. (gun firing) [Robbie] Oh, have we started shooting already? Get it? Shooting. Hey, this is worse than the UFO tour with Bob Hope. Remember the gang? Ra Ra memories. (guns firing) That reminds me of the very funny story. Bob and I were flying to the Philippines. And he turns to this girl who's got nothing on, but a couple of coconut shells, and he says, darling you know, I can pour more juice. Oh, hi fellas. Just in time, things are looking up. They almost cooked our goose. Our lobster, you mean George? We're running late. This picture's way behind schedule. Go get the camera crew. Read. [Crewman] We be ready, Miss Judy. Where shall we set up? [Judy] First scene's over there chief. Hubba hubba, look at those gams. I'm a leg man, myself. Be my main squeeze, baby? George, the star's putting the moves on me. Hold on Judy, I'm coming. Okay Robbie, get your claws off, you over-sexed shrimp. [Robbie] Hey, what kind of part is this? I don't get the girl? I'm a horny Crustacean, get it, horny crustacean. You don't get it. Ah, I quit. Come on Judy. Without a star, how can we end the picture? It's the movies Judy, we just freeze the frame, and it says The End. [Narrator] Hello sports devotees. We're in the Picayune Picture Postcard principality of Oxnard, where Prince Pophead himself will judge these nerds, to see which ox will go to the Olympic. Wrestle. [Narrator] Hence the terrible shower cap triplets versus the handsome hunk, a furious fight to the final finish. I'm really pumped up for this. And I hope the balloon in my crown doesn't pop. [Narrator] Uh oh, the triplets a tearing into each other. You can handle 'em handsome. Give 'em the horrible horrific hunk hug. [Narrator] And the hunk's got 'em in his catatonic cartwheel. Oh, he's spinning out. Remember what I told you hunky, come on. Hey ugly, take a leap. Look out Hunk. [Narrator] That's two down in one spare to go. But the Hunk's in trouble now. The Terrible Triplet is spitting in his hair. Can the Hunk get that little monkey off his back. He's over and out. Whoopee. [Narrator] Hunk is the champ. We're going to LA Hunk, we're going all the way. Men, bring the whoopee cushion. I am going to the bathroom. We're not gonna get to watch the foxy mud wrestlers. I wonder why the Prince sent me to see the East German sports doc. There he is, Doctor Pill Popper, Doctor Pill Popper. Hey, rooster head, where'd you get that helmet? The Prince gave it to me. I'm gonna wrestle in the Olympics, and he said you had a special diet for me. You bet your cock's column. I'm gonna give you a gold medal body. The thrill of agony, the smell of defeat. What do you got? Mega vitamins? Mega vitamins? That's sissy stuff, kiddo. I'm going to pump your puny little muscles full of steroids. Are these the steroids, huh? Yeah. Hey, I don't need this crap. What are you doing? Give me that stuff. No no no. It's in our laboratory. Someone tried your drugs. Doctor, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. I'm giving you to the commission. There's the nerd. Open the door, come on. Must be Berlin Wall. (confused yelling) You guys weren't invited to the party. Come on Doc, let's get out of here. And watch out. Your punks are junk. Hey, listen. Back off, before I lower the iron curtain on you. Oh yeah? You and what red army? [Doc Voiceover] I wonder if I should leave? Hey, you're rubbing off my deodorant. It's expensive. I think I'll put a wrench on this monkey. The referee says round one is over. (speaking in foreign language) (clanging) (humming) Hey, Doctor Pill Popper? Hey, I need another shot. No, I gave you my best shot yesterday. That's just it. Since you gave me those steroids yesterday, I'm growing so fast, I can't get out of my helmet. Go away. I've got an appointment with the Russian secret weapon. The Man of Steel. ♪ Give me shot, Doc ♪ Let the Man of Steel rust with the rest of those Iron Curtain cretins. You're gonna give me some more steroids, or I'm gonna squeeze the crease right out of your lapel. Claws of my connection, chicken head. (muffled) with puny peasant girl. An injection. And two years later, I am pewter samovar, now in the five-year plan, I am good for Stalingrad, man of iron. Hey, what's happening? Just like you kept to his peaks, while he's trying to raise the price of steel. I wipe you out. Wait until the great crack. Let me have it, Doc. No, not like that. Why don't you just take five, huh? Now, I'll take that black bag, and we'll go to LA. What do you say? Gummy sack, Coach. They're flying like this? Who? The Hunk from Oxford escape with doctor. Doctor Pill Popper? Yes, the pop piller. Yes. Yes. Oh, there they are. We must stop them. Oh boy, first class to LA. If we let them escape, Parky will take away our funny hats. Launch the missiles. Yes, Comrade Gummy Sack Coach, prepare to launch peace-loving weapons. (muffled speaking) Time for launch. Nonexistent peace-loving systems launch first. We're going to do another double-O seven. I think we're being followed. Look. Pull over, pull over. What is it? It's the LA police. Get down. This is a rent-a-wreck, and my license is expired. This is peace-loving LA secret police. Pull over to side of sky, and prepare to spread them. We'd better pull out a bridge. Where are they? (explosion) (laughing) Now we can go pump the girls. (crashing) Turn on the TV. And watch it on the eyewitness news report. You okay, Hunk? I told you we should have bribed that cop. My drugger's wallet was stuck in my helmet. Let's pop the Doc out of the cockpit, and make sure he's still got the steroids. Yeah. Come on, Doc. Oh yeah, yeah they're here. Keep it under your hat, Doc. (laughing) Gee, lucky that rent-a-car place was still open, eh Hunk? Yeah, ask 'em for four horsepower Mustang convertible, look what they give us. Look out Olympic city, here come the nerds, yahoo. This is gnarly, whatever that means. That's LA, fellas. (dramatic orchestral music) [Man Voiceover] Let's see now, if I just twist these little nuts here, he should be up and at 'em, huh? Easy, big fella. Easy. Are you still working on that defective Russian, doctor? He's not defective. He's a defector. One night on the fabulous sunset strip, and he's become a Russian red star on Hollywood Boulevard. I know just how he feels doctor. And I'm turning pro, myself. What's that? I'm his publicist. And we're gonna make some big bucks. Splendid, you finally caught on. Only idiots wrestle for free in the Olympics. We'll call you The Sadistic Sailor, and I'll jam so many steroids into your jeans, you'll be the biggest thing on Mexican television. Here's your first opponent. Hey, Don't hit him. Save it for the ring. But that ton of tin will crush him. Ha ha, don't worry, it's all fixed. See? Your manager's in on it. And I get 50%. Sure, then you can afford a decent haircut. (dramatic orchestral music) Yes sir, I'll see to it personally. That was a call from Big Brother. Awesome. Domestic Control reports that a private citizen still has a pistol. Really? The last one's in J Hunker Bunk security condo, that para-military paranoid in Pasadena. I'll go get it myself. Help me zip up the fly on this flying suit, will ya. Hey, these government issue Gucci commuter suits are never the right size. Blow his brains out with this commander. Sure, it's for his own good. You know, Commander Adenoid, that leather coat sets off your blue eyes like beautifully. How can you tell? It's a black and white film. Let's see, I wonder how you get this thing started. Hey, running doesn't work. Oh, I gotta figure this out. Oh yeah, it's this little thing here. Whoa! Oh, this is fast. Hey, if I'm lucky I should get to the President Glenn Rocket Base before I get airsick. Commander, this is the studio police. Your miniature is cleared for takeoff. Is everybody insured? Like this is a union ship, man. Okay, ignite the special effects. All right sir, okay guys, light the sparklers. (firing) Groovy. Start pulling the miniature. Miniature being pulled, sir. Hey, Hey, not so fast fellas. Now everybody lean back and pretend that you're flying. [Kid] Like, do we get stunt pay for this man? Keep leading. [Kid] Hey like, is this stunt over? And when are we gonna get a whiz break? [Woman] My butt's asleep. Yeah, we'll take the moon exit from the Pasadena freeway. Oh, is that when we're gonna have lunch there. [Woman] Got any gum, my ears are popping. We're passing over Los Angeles. That nuclear power plant disorder sure cleared up the smog. No traffic jams. [Woman] Yeah, Commander, no traffic either. [Commander] This is exciting, isn't it? Isn't it? There's Bunker's compound ahead. It's a model. His house is as big as Big Brother's. Hey, watch those ad libs. Oh, don't you like women's lib? It's a sin against the state to have anything bigger than Big Brother's, and worst of all, Bunker's got a gun. He won't have it for long. (Laughing) Prepare cardboard rocket for landing. Going into overtime, sir. It's double or this turkey won't land. [Commander] Prepare for landing sound effects. [Kid] The sound effects unions on strike, man. I'll have to do it myself. Roll 'em. You asked for it. (buzzing) [Commander] If you hit those rubber rocks we'll bounce right off the table. (yelling) Oh boy, it sure is a bright day for night. That nuclear power plant just keeps pumping it out. Up and away! ♪ I'm flying ♪ Superman III has nothing on me. Hey, that rhymes, good writers. This is model living if I've ever seen it. How do you stop this thing? Oh, I guess that's how you stop it. It looks just like the top of the studio. Well, this must be the master bedroom ventilator, just what I'm looking for. Now for a whiff of this Big Brother brand hippy happy incense. Ought to make old Bunker as peaceful as a puppy on acid. Whatever that means. ♪ Eight miles high ♪ Have a little whiff on me, Buster. Dear Big Brother, my house is bigger than yours and I've got a gun. Yada, yada, yada, yada. Ooh. Ready or not Bunker, here I come. Punch my chest, and I'm off. I can't even remember how to spell yada yada yada yada. What a bummer! Jeeves, this place smells like a love in. Get the air freshener. Go get it yourself. What's happening? I'm gonna talk like a hippie. I'd better get myself a big whiff of that Joe Namath brutal perfume spray and air freshener. Oh, I'm gonna crash. And I don't even know what that means. Open prop door. Okay Bunker, put 'em up. I'm so tired, I haven't slept. Well, that gas really works. I should use it on my kids. I'd probably use it already. Ah, there's the handgun. He's got it attractively mounted on the stand with a look of real (muffled). Big whiff here. [Commander] Where's the prop department? Props? It'll drive me nuts. Don't want to monkey around with this thing for too long, could wrench my back. Gotta have big hands for this gun, but then you've gotta have big hands for a lot of things. It's one of those mothers from Big Brother. Big women. No time for joking, just reach up here. Say, this is sort of like a big one. Geez, geez, put some Namath in your nose, there boy. He's gonna take our gun away. Come on, jump 'em. (confused yelling) One for you. (confused yelling) Right to the kisser. (laughing) Now to get out of here. Right to the funny hat, right to the funny hat. Right to the funny hat, this fight is over. I be bad, I be beautiful. Grab this gat and get. Open prop door. I be history. How do you fall out of this fallout shelter? Hey, where are the set builders? Oh yeah, I know. Open other prop door. Oh boy, is Big Brother is gonna be proud of me? Oh my aching skullcap. Guards, guards, a geek in a helmet has escaped with my handgun. Go after him in the funny car. Funny car on the way, sir. Uh oh, gotta get some new shocks for this thing. Working for Bunker's no picnic. Yeah, but the gals really go for these uniforms. You said it! This mother's a monster. To think people used to sleep with these things under their pillows. Bullet head, bullet head, I'm over here. Oh hi toots. Wow, you got it. Yeah, here it is. The last handgun on earth. Listen, I'll help you lug it in the direction of the ship, then I'll moon the guards, and divert them with some flashy flying effects. What's the matter? Never handle a big gun before? Oh, this is murder on my kidneys. I gotta take a wicked leak. Careful, you'll drown in that space suit. Are you bozos following me home? It's working. All I gotta do is set the suit down in one piece. One piece suit, get it? Whoa. I got the gun. But when I left Jay Bunker Hunt, he sent a couple of goons after me, in what looked like a hopped up Edsel. Boscoe car, but the shocks will ruin your kidneys. Bypass the pollution device. We can't do that Commander, it's against the law. But you're the star, let's smog 'em out. Hey guys, stop rocking the set. Can't see 'em in the smog. Ah shoot! [Kid] This quick-cutting is making me dizzy man. Missed 'em, aim for the wires. Wow, they hit a prop wire. We're doomed and I was guaranteed two weeks, wow. Shoot the director. Like we made it. Yes, We made it. And the last gat on Earth became the final exhibit in Big Brother's Handgun Museum. And what of me? I was given a position on the Ministry of Truth. Or is it the Ministry of Lies? Who cares? It's all over now. (light orchestral music) [Narrator] Our story begins with the opening of the graffiti-proof gates on another perfect day in heaven. The Archangel Gabe had requested a top level meeting in the oval office. Do you really think it's wise to allow Californians to enter into heaven? We had no choice, God. There's too many of them. Everyone's dying to move to the Sunbelt. If we don't let them in, heaven will be overrun with New Yorkers, and you can see how they've trashed the place already. Californians, living in paradise? It still doesn't seem quite right to me. Do you think they'll all need their own separate hot tubs? Look, we gotta modernize, and that's why we made a pinup like you, God. Right Jerry? Right. I was God when old men were happening. And though that scam lasted for 5,000 years, these Californicates are youth oriented. And that's why we went with you, sweet cakes. You are a real hard body. And you've got great feet. And I've got plans for this dump, and no ditzy deity's gonna stop me. I don't trust that bozo's interior monologues. Let's see, we can melt down the golden streets, make ankle chains and razorblade necklaces out of them, sell them as souvenirs. Say, how do you blow your nose. I don't. By the way, the two LA real estate men are waiting. Come on, how do you blow your nose? Shove it up your nose. Hey, rubber wings. Where are you going? I'm talking to you. I don't get no respect. Oh wow, what a dump. [Man] Bet you can't get a good sprout and champagne brunch around here. [Man] Just look at those poor suckers. Circling for parking places. [Man] No place to surf, and they've had rent control for 5,000 years. When we get through with this joint, it's gonna look just like LA. We're gonna have trouble with the New Yorkers. What do you mean? When we get the contract and tell these Brooklyn bums they're gonna have to scarf avocados on boogie boards, there's gonna be a riot. Can we trust this guy, Gabe? Oh, sure. (trumpets blowing) The angel Gabe wants you to know the fix is in. Follow me. Wow, dig these fly boys. Think they have anything under their skirts? If they do, it's rubber. Louie, did you dig what those guys have over their heads? It looks like they were wearing a full chamber pot upside down. Yeah, but at least they could blow their noses. Don't rub it in. This sure am some long way from Oakland. But looky here, dinner on the wing. Those turkeys be easy pickings excepting, I ain't got me no hunting license, and I ain't about to get in no more trouble. No, sirree. One minute, I be busy looking at the sporting goods store, next thing I know there's the big bang and I'm up here in the high rent district. Hello? Hey, anybody home? I guess not. They're probably all out in the back, splashing in the pool. [Woman] Attention new residents. Your prayers have been answered and you've made it to heaven. But remember, no pets, no children, and no discharging of firearms within the heavenly halls. Report to the admissions desk, where you'll be issued rubber wings, a miniskirt, and a snot-proof helmet. Have a nice eternity. This is heaven. I wonder if there's any (muffled) around here. You know, folks I can eat some goat with. Uh oh, here comes the police. Feet, do your stuff. [Guard] Maybe if I carry a kleenex on the end of my spear. Now this is your typical sweat shop in heaven. And I think you guys could turn it into maybe like a jacuzzi, or a steam bath. I mean, look at this dump. This is a New Yorker's idea of paradise. Can you believe it? Uh oh, the Gothamites, the California mites are here. Show them your aerobics. Touch your toes. You're making real progress, turning these Manhattan sophisticates into West coast airheads. We got them in designer cutoffs, and look at those tans. It sucks sir. These developers in Los Angeles are turning this pit into a racquetball club. Sign up or go to hell. Whatever. Now you hotshots better not screw up on this deal. For sure. I got enough trouble with Goldilocks upstairs. So you better watch your step. That barfs me out, like totally. I'm first, I won. I get to take off my helmet and sneeze. Keep your nose on. There were two new arrivals from California in the loading dock, let's go. Hey, watch where you put that spear. Is this heaven or hell, Buck? I don't know. Well, I mean, where's God? I think they heard them. God, are you dead? God? I'd know that California accent anywhere. I heard something over this way, uh oh. Hold it right there, San Francisco basket toys. Hey sleazy, will you look at this? We're picking up two real Californians. I'm not into fruit. The little one looks like an overripe avocado. The big one looks like a bad impression of weirdo Earhart. Cool it, we get the point. In the name of her most hard-bodies holiness, we welcome you two wimps to what used to be the heavenly city. How can you guys breathe in those things? Take these two airheads to the deli. It's lunchtime. [Woman] Attention. The New York deli has been closed for remodeling. All citizens will report to the juice bar for beet squash and sushi. (crowd yelling) Okay, lunch everybody. Hey! (crowd yelling) Jesus, it's a riot. What's God's extension? Gabe, your Angeles is gonna be a hell of a food fight. Let's eat. Holy cow. I never thought there'd be such a beef over the health food. I'd better lockup my pastrami in the freezer. I want to cut some bologna with this. Uh oh, I told you bean spouts was a bummer. We should have started with tofu. [Crowd] We're hungry! They're my children and they'll eat what I tell them to eat, and they'll like it. Come on, don't be chicken. Just don't look directly at her. Don't call her by her real name. What is the meaning of this? No metaphysics, okay? Us New Yorkers was here, first, and frankly, we're real meat people. This is a great time for an interior monologue, which I had something to say. We're gonna blow up health food mountain. (crowd yelling) Big deal, I can create an all over again, by the next day. (explosion) Lunchtime Leo, where are the Christians? This is awesome. These earthquakes are making me homesick for LA. Whoa. Bumper stickers! Run for your life. What do you mean run? Aren't we supposed to be jogging? This is worse than lunch hour. Over here Parno. Stuff your hip pockets with these free health nuts. I want some of this trail mix. Don't forget the vitamin C, and the starch waters. All this dust, my aching allergies. This pollution is killing me. I heard the Californians like hard rock but this is too much. This way. There's a much better view of the smog up here. This is almost as exciting as Halloween in San Francisco. Sure is boss, reminds me of the day after the day after. See what's happened, this place has gone to hell. You know, I'd rather remake paradise on Earth. Paradise on Earth? Honey, we got that already. (light orchestral music) [Man] Frozen burritos will be ready in a Jiffy guys. I know you'll find this hard to believe, God honey, but HUD and I converted this garage into an apartment for about five bucks. Gee, I love Los Angeles. Oh no! I burned the burritos. We'll send out. Okay? There's a great little Thai place just around the corner. Yeah, remember Pud, you and I met there over the monkey cups. And remember what you thought I gave you? Yeah, lice. That's right, and now that we found you, God sweetie, no more bar hopping. This'll be our little blue heaven. [God] A blue movie in black and white. (laughing) (dramatic orchestral music)
