(triumphant music) (eerie tense music) - [Helen] We call it the Plague, but no one really believes it. Everybody knows we did this to ourselves. HIV, BSE, SARS, avian flu, viruses have been taking a massive toll on human life for decades, but then brand-new viruses began appearing, so many and so fast that we stopped naming them. The Plague was going to wipe us out. Desperate scientists combined rapidly mutating viruses with DNA, attempting to create the perfect vaccine. The first tests on dogs were incredibly promising. Thousands of people lined up for vaccinations and paid the price. Within months, they became horribly mutated and insane. We had created something new, a manmade bloodborne virus. The Scavenger virus. Thousands became mindless killers, ravaging the last pockets of human existence, spreading the deadly Scav virus that coursed through their veins. Now we can only survive below the surface in sealed bunkers. We did it to ourselves. (heavy ventilated breathing) (leaves rustling) (intense dramatic music) (water splashing) (dogs snarling) (Kelly screaming) (Kelly gasping) (Kelly breathing heavily) (Kelly groaning) (knocking) - Yeah, yeah, come in. - [Sal] Rough night, Sarge? - Rough day, Corporal? - [Sal] Level 18, briefing room. Asking for you specifically. - Sounds like a surface trip. See you in rack room. - Right. - [Kelly] Here we go. (tense music) - [Announcer] Attention. As part of the ongoing efforts to conserve energy, the atomic generator will be shut down between 2300 hours tonight and 800 hours tomorrow. All critical systems will be switched to battery power. Residents are urged to restrict electrical usage to essential needs only. In addition, water rationing for United Bunker sections 108 through 115 will begin at 1600 hours. - What's going on? - We have visitors. (electricity crackling) (alarm beeping) - [Kelly] Power strikes from the reactors are getting worse. (elevators whirring) - [Announcer] Attention. As of 1900 hours United Bunker is on red alert in response to the emergency situation. - You look tired. - I feel tired. - [Announcer] Reduce the risk of contamination. - You're still having the dreams, aren't you? - [Announcer] In Section L. (man grunting) - [Man] Oh God. - Okay. - Helen, Sergeant Kelly. - [Both] Sir. - Okay, since yesterday HB-1428 lost all power in the north section of the surface facility. There was a big spike and it went down everywhere. - We got these before the spike hit. - What, uh, what is that right there? (computer beeping) - Someone who was flying a helicopter. - [Kelly] Well, how did they make it 600 miles through all the storms? - Genius, a miracle, I don't know. - You're telling me this now. - It happens. Look, comms are getting less reliable by the day. Anyway. (keyboard keys clacking) I managed to get into SatNet. I don't know how long I can hold it, but for now anyway we've got these. It's the Hudson, or what's left of it. - [Kelly] It's a big hole. Nuclear? - Radiation levels are normal, but the bunker's definitely breached. - What caused it? - My best guess? A meteor strike. It's the only thing that could've caused such damage. - Survivors? - Not sure, but there is some smoke from the helicopter crash that's drawing attention, perimeter's been breached in several places, and the automatic defense system is inoperable. - Scavs hit the site yet? - Not yet, but they will soon. - We need a squad to sweep for survivors and retrieve the data storage from the helicopter. - Hang on, just one squad? - We can handle it. - Good, then get moving. (computer beeping) (keyboard keys clacking) (computer beeping) (door thudding) - All right, let's go, ladies! What, you're not ready yet, Sal? Come on. (tense determined music) - It is true that Sarge is the reason we have the serum? - All I know is he's the best damn squad leader I ever saw. Stick close to him and you might make it back alive. - You remember all those animals they experimented on before they screwed up and created the Scav virus? - Yeah. - Well, there's a lot of them still up there. - Bullshit, gringo, the only thing up there is the filthy Scavs and the Plague. (Kadowski chuckling) - Yeah, so we thought, 'til the sarge went out on recon and was attacked by wild dogs mutated by the virus. He was infected, almost killed. It's his antibodies they're using to create the serum. Yeah, so thanks to the sarge, if you keep taking that serum then the Plague can't touch you. The thing is, though, Sarge is still infected, he's still got some of that mutant dog coursing through his veins. - Sending mission specs on overlay. Pick up the pace, team. - And you know what the really terrifying thing about all this is? - [Kadowski] Huh? (Charley barking) (Kadowski screaming) - Now you heard the lady, let's turn and burn! Let's turn and burn. (man coughing) (man groaning) (alarm beeping) - Time. - Better than the hazard suits. Got a tear in my suit once, (speaking foreign language) put me in the quarantine for three fucking weeks! You know, then they got me with really big needles with this blood sample. - Why doesn't this stuff work on Scavs? - 'Cause the Scav virus was created from human DNA, it's too complex for any vaccine, nothing cures it. They tried it on some of them, it killed them instantly. All right, let's gear up and move out! Come on! (machinery whirring) (alarm wailing) (air hissing) (keyboard keys clacking) (alarm wailing) (machinery whirring) (machinery thudding) (fire whooshing) (fires crackling) - Sergeant Kelly, give me a squawk from the OV, I'll triangulate. - [Kelly] Roger that. (computer beeping) - There! There's our survivor. (suspenseful music) (rocks clattering) (water pattering) (zip line whirring) - [Charley] Game on. (gunshot booming) (body thudding) - Scavs moving fast, seven o'clock from target. (blow thudding) (blows thudding) (blows thudding) (Scav grunting) Scav, six o'clock and moving in, guys. (gunshot booming) (blows thudding) (Scav yelping) (blows thudding) (Scavs grunting) (Kadowski exhaling) - My last cigar. (intense suspenseful music) (gunshot booming) (Scav grunting) (Scav grunting) (Kelly yelping) (Scav yelling) (gunshot booming) - [Kelly] Are you getting this? - No, I don't see you. (Scav grunting) (blows thudding) (Scav yelping) (gunshot booming) (blows thudding) (Scav yelping) Kochi, Scav, five o'clock! (wall crashing) (Scav screaming) - [Sal] Target is acquired. (computer beeping) - He checks out. Dr. Gene Reinold, Hudson Bunker. - [Kelly] Roger that. (footstep crunching) (door thudding) (stick thudding) (Scav grunting) (Scav yelping) (blow thudding) (Scav grunting) (gunshot booming) Sal, Kadowski, escort the target back to base. - Okay, proceed with caution. (suspenseful music) - [Kelly] Charley, 20 seconds to the second dome. - [Charley] Copy that, I'm right behind you, and right behind me, a load of trouble! (alarm wailing) (explosion booming) (Scavs screaming) (explosion booming) (Scavs screaming) (explosion booming) (explosion booming) (Scav screaming) (serum whirring) (explosion booming) (Scavs screaming) (explosion booming) (Scav screaming) (explosion booming) (explosion booming) (Scavs screaming) (explosion booming) (Scavs screaming) (explosions booming) (Scavs screaming) (machinery whirring) (explosion booming) (Scavs screaming) (explosions booming) (Scav screaming) (explosions booming) (glass shattering) (air whooshing) (crystal warbling) (tense pensive music) - We've recovered most of Dr. Reinold's research from the crash. - What research? (hologram beeping) - After the meteor strike, Dr. Reinolds discovered something in the crater. (hologram beeping) A crystal. - What is this crystal? - The salvation on mankind. When I went to the crater I discovered a crystal unlike anything on Earth. When I brought it into my lab to study it all my infected patients, who had any good DNA left, started to get better. - What are you saying? - The crystal was putting out a strange harmonic resonance. Anyone in close proximity to the vibration was cured. Let me make this clear, it wasn't just slowing the virus down, it was stopping it completely, destroying it at a genetic level and repairing the damaged cells. - Well, even if that were true, what good is one small crystal gonna do? - I didn't have a chance to study the components of the crystal, but I believe if I can analyze it and synthesize enough of them then we can stop this virus, we could, we could potentially take our planet back. (Reinold sighing) Our communications were down, before we could get them back up we were attacked. - Scavs? - Yes. The bunker was unsecured. They came in, they, they killed everybody, including my family, and they took the crystal. There was nothing any of us could do. I just hid until they left and then I, I started to make my way back here. - We're so sorry for your loss. - Thank you. - So this crystal, it didn't cure the Scavs? - The Scavs have no healthy cells remaining, the infection has progressed too far to be reversed. Anybody who is infected with the Scav virus has to be exposed to the crystal as soon as possible. - Then why did they take it? - I don't know. It wasn't curing them but it was, it was affecting them. - Affecting them how? - I don't know, Sergeant, I didn't have time to ask them, I was too busy trying to stay alive. (councilman speaking foreign language) - You would like to retrieve the crystal? - This is ridiculous, it could take our teams years to find this crystal. - No, using my data I can take one of your scanning devices and I can set it to the specific frequency of the crystal, but we have to act now. These Scavs are on the move all the time, if we lose this signal we may never get it back. - Kelly, how long will it take the prep the squad? - We can be ready in 15. Helen, call Red, get the Winnie ready. - I'm going with you, Sarge. - Absolutely not, you're a scientist, not a soldier. - I'm the only one who has any experience with this crystal, Colonel. This is too important to jeopardize to a bunch of-- - Grunts? Appreciate your vote of confidence, Doctor. Sir? Fine. I hope you can take care of yourself. (vehicle engine rumbling) - Ready to kill some Scavs? - No, I'm really not. Are you? - [Red] Ready's my middle name. - Well, my mine's Cornelius, and if you ever tell anyone, I'll gut you like a fish. - Ha, Charley Cornelius Wagner, that's a butler's name! - (chuckling) Yeah, shut up. (Red laughing) - [Kelly] How's it going, Alvarez? - Everything tiptop, Sarge. - Good, good. - I just wanna say that it's an honor that, um, I'm part of the squad and that you're leading us. - Thanks, man, that means a lot. - She's my life, she's my everything. I just want her to live on a safe planet and I'm not so good with words. - Yeah, no, you are, Alvarez. And she's a beautiful little girl, she'll be very proud of you. Let's TCB, all right? - [Alvarez] Yeah, take care of some business. - There you go. (vehicle engine rumbling) (tense music) - May I, uh, have your glasses? My eyes are bothering me. - You know I already miss my baby back at the bunker. - You have a child? - No, that's my girlfriend. Sweetest 18-year-old you ever seen. Big lips, rubbery skin. You know what really drives me crazy, Doc? - (sighing) No, no, I don't. - Those white cotton panties. Nothing but white cotton panties dancing around our quarters. - Yeah, well, that sounds like love to me. - No, it's got nothing to do with love, Doc. You believe in heaven? - Yes, yes, I do. - Heaven's all right for some stuff, but in hell they got everything. (thunder crashing) (vehicle whirring) (computer beeping) - Reading a strong signal. ETA approximately eight minutes. (vehicle engine rumbling) - You could've done all this from the bunker. - You heard Reinold, this is far too risky for something to go wrong. - Now if something goes wrong I've gotta worry about protecting you. - Hey, I can take care of myself. Not like I've had much choice recently. - This isn't about us, Helen. - You know what, you're right. 'Cause since your accident there's been no us. - Accident? You make it sound like I sprained my ankle! I mean, I'm not sure what I am anymore. I have been infected, all right? I could've died out there! - But you didn't, Daniel. You're alive and so am I. - The signal's getting weaker. Helen, what have we got? - ETA, white zone, three minutes. (grim suspenseful music) (vehicle engine rumbling) (fire crackling) (vehicle engine rumbling) - We had plans, remember? A family? - How can, how can you even? You know what, you don't know what it's like, you don't know! (sticks thudding) Hey, excuse me, fellas, I'm trying to have a constructive argument with my wife here! (sticks thudding) Stop! (blows thudding) Why, is that why you volunteered to do this job, so you can just bust my balls? - I'm here for the mission, the crystal. - Yeah, well I-- - Daniel! - Am here... (eerie warbling) - Daniel? (serum whirring) (Kelly yelping) (tense music) - Ah, beautiful, isn't it? - Yeah, it is. It doesn't look like much now, but I'd give anything to get out of that damn bunker for good! - What the fuck? - Sal, what the hell is wrong with you? It looks like you swallowed a lemon (laughing). - Man, I got a pit in my stomach and when I get a pit in my stomach, something bad usually happens. - Put your hand down your skirt, grab your balls, and remind yourself that you're a badass bitch. (vehicle engine rumbling) (tense music) - This is it, end of the road. - Oh shit. Okay, this is far as we go on wheels, it's time to go for a walk. - Now the hard part. (birds chirping) (backpack thudding) - Looks like we got a couple of peckerheads scoping us, boys. - Ah, Humpty Dumpties! Ain't gonna be a fight. (gun clicking) Make sure you load up, girls, looks like we got a couple guests. (tense suspenseful music) - No guilt, no remorse, no love. Sounds easier to be a soulless creature than a (speaking foreign language) human. - Hey, whose side are you on anyhow? - Think about it, same old tears, no fears! - No sex, no music, no Mary Jane. - Yeah, well, good thinking, humans win hands down. - Damn right I'm right. - Now this is gonna be a fight! - That's impossible, they're just a bunch of stupid Scavs! - Stay inside! - What? - Just do what I say. - Now I got a pit in my stomach. - Shit! They almost look organized. (gunshots popping) (bullets whizzing) (gunshots thundering) (Scavs yelping) (gunshots booming) (gunshots thundering) (Scavs yelping) (air whooshing) (gunshots thundering) (Scav screaming) (gunshots thundering) (explosion booming) (Scavs screaming) (gunshots booming) (Scav grunting) (Scav screaming) (gunshot booming) - Ah! (Kelly grunting) (blows thudding) (Scavs grunting) (blows thudding) (gunshots thundering) (blows thudding) (Scavs grunting) (Sal grunting) (blows thudding) (Scav grunting) (explosion booming) (Scavs screaming) (gunshots thundering) (blows thudding) (Scav grunting) (Kelly grunting) (gunshots thundering) (blows thudding) (Sal grunting) (Scav grunting) - Go back where you belong, you filthy monkeybugs! (gunshot popping) - [Charley] Cody! (somber music) - Scavs aren't supposed to be smart enough for this. - They've been exposed to the crystal, some of the mutation is gone. - You said it didn't cure them. - It's not curing them, it's evolving them. - What does that mean? - The crystal isn't killing the Scav virus, it's, it's speeding up the virus' evolution, it's, it's making them less barbaric, it's making them smarter. - So that's good, right? They're turning back into humans. - No, no, they're not. - Then what are they turning into? - I don't know, something new, something different. - Perfect! (scanner beeping) - They're on the move. - All right, grab your gear, let's go. (grim suspenseful music) (tense music) (birds chirping) (Charley sighing) - [Kadowski] Oh, you fart again, Red! - [Red] Wasn't me, I think it was Charley. (Red and Kadowski laughing) - You pair of fuckwits. I'm talking about the smell of trees, grass, fresh air. - Yeah, it feels good, Charley. - I prefer the smell of piss from our bunker, the smell of safety. Cut the crap! - Chill out, you redneck! (dramatic suspenseful music) - Scavs? - Now that looks dangerous! What is it? - It's a Caniglus lagomorpha. A very scary bunny rabbit. - They all don't look like that in them kiddie books. - You scared our dinner, you hillbilly. (gunshot booming) - I didn't. (pensive music) (eerie whooshing) (birds chirping) (alarm beeping) - Time! (serums whirring) Dr. Reinold? - Yes? - Do you need help administering your dose? - No, I'm also keeping time, I already did it, thank you. They're on the move. - Well, then so are we. Let's go. (tense music) (fire crackling) (crickets chirping) - Man, now this is some protein! - Aren't you worried about the Plague? - He'll be okay as long as the serum doesn't wear off before his body assimilates the protein. - What? - As long as your lungs don't swell up and explode within 12 hours, you're fine. - Just needs a shot of something. (serum whirring) - I still don't get why all these viruses popped up at once. - It seems obvious to me, it's Mother Nature's revenge for raping the planet. - In a manner of speaking, you're right. When the Plague virus first hit, N4H2 exploded in a matter of days. 7.4 million people died in a week. The planet was so overpopulated there was no place to hide. Every densely populated region of this planet was wiped out. - My father would go on for hours about how we did this to ourselves. - Well, your father was right. The virus was completely manmade. When the mutating cells were combined with a million DNA, the vaccine became stable, but human DNA is so complex it allowed the mutation to be ongoing and we still don't know why. - So if the serum kills Scavs and this crystal thing doesn't work on them, what're we supposed to do with them? - Well, when we take the planet back, well, we started the Scav virus, Sergeant, we'll find a way to treat it. - No! I say we keep doing what we've always done, and eventually we'll kill them all. (dramatic music) - What the hell's the point of saving humankind if we're only gonna screw it up again? - Well, we screwed it up once, we won't do it again. - I hope you're right, Sergeant. I hope you're right. (tense somber music) (computer humming) - Who's out there? (fire crackling) - I'm sorry, didn't mean to scare you. I was having seconds thoughts about paying you a visit. Whiskey? - Some things never change, do they? I guess one drink won't hurt. - Now you're talking. - Our whole lives we hear about how the Earth used to be. Seems like some distant fairytale, yet here I am, outside breathing air, (both chuckling) camping out and getting drunk with my estranged husband. - Drunk? - I'm tipsy. - Better have a little more. (Helen chuckling) I'd be lying if I said I didn't miss you. - Then why did you push me away? - When it happened, the only thing that gave me the strength to make it back to the bunker was thinking about you but then afterwards when they developed the serum from my blood everyone was treating me different like, like a hero or like a freak (chuckling), but they were treating me different, and I just couldn't bear the thought of you treating me that way so it was easier just not to face you at all. - It's always about you, isn't it? - What? - Do you think it was easy for me to see the man I love being treated like, like an experiment? Did you ever stop to think that I just loved you no matter what? You know, we did talk about having children-- - Well, how can you even bring that up, how? - Because this crystal, it might change-- - No, I will not risk having children that could turn out to be a freak like me! All right, so just drop it! (suspenseful music) (zipper humming) (leaves rustling) (leaves rustling) - [Red] I'm paranoid. (air whooshing) (tense dramatic music) (dogs snarling) (crickets chirping) (calm pensive music) (Kochi panting) (Kadowski panting) - [Kadowski] Kochi? Kochi? - Hey! - Hey. - Were you worried about me? You big, bad Boris! - No, I was just-- - Yeah, sure. - Yeah. - I'll race you to camp. - You don't have chance! (tent rustling) - If it's not regarding this mission, I don't wanna hear it. - About what I said last night, I over-- - There's nothing to say. - For a communications commander, you sure are a lousy communicator. - Scavs are stationary. If we hurry, we can make up some distance. - All right. All right, let's pack it up, move it out! (tense pensive music) - [Kochi] Oh my God, no, no, no! (Kochi sobbing) (grim music) - Jesus, Red! (Kochi sobbing) - Scavs. - Oh, Red, you stupid... No, this wasn't the work of Scavs. - Let's give him a proper burial. (Kochi sobbing) (somber music) (liquid splashing) - Rest in peace, brother. (tense music) - Let's go, Doc, keep up with the class. (Reinold coughing) Get up. Come on. - I'm coming, I'm fine. - It's not a field trip, move. - With all the shit we give each other, I really miss that big damn cowboy. He set me up to meet this girl, it was a double date and Red said these girls were a couple of good-lookers. - And you believed him? I've only ever seen that guy with zombies. - Yeah, yeah, they were ugly! - (chuckling) That's my point, they all look like they stepped straight out of a car crash. - [Kadowski] Mm. - 100% pure ugliness. - The cute thing is that he thought that they were beautiful. - Best marksman I know, he was still blind as a bat. (grim suspenseful music) You okay, Kadowski? - What do you think? - [Kochi] Come on, big guy, you can do it, you can make it all the way up this mountain. - [Kadowski] You've got to be kidding me! - [Sal] Quit whining, Kadowski. - Said you could handle it, Doc, then handle it! - You're wearing on my nerves, Sergeant. - [Helen] Pain in the ass. (tense music) - [Reinold] We're getting close, eight kilometers to go. - [Kochi] Did everyone hear that? (air whooshing) (suspenseful music) - I feel them sizing us up. - Then let's just keep moving, yeah? - How're you holding up? - Would be lying if I said I wasn't scared, you? - Nothing I haven't handled before. (birds chirping) - Oh, this is beautiful. Look it it, out here everything is flourishing, it's alive. Listen to the birds singing and we're dying. - Maybe we're not as intelligent as we think. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, I already take twice as much as everybody else. No, I can't afford to waste it! Just stay close to me. (grim suspenseful music) (water splashing) (birds chirping) - Sushi? (water splashing) - Over here! It's a Scav. Looks pretty messed up. - He's still alive! (tense music) - [Scav] Help me. - Did he just talk? (Scav moaning) - Is that the crystal? Doctor? - The crystal's speeding up the virus' evolution. I still have time. - You still have time for what? - We, we still have time to get the crystal. (alarm beeping) - Time! Come on, everybody, we can't afford to miss a dose. - All right, let's push on. (suspenseful music) - [Kochi] Whoops! (Kochi chuckling) (Kochi and Kadowski chuckling) - Hey! - Hey what? - Are you a queer, Kadowski? - What? - No, if you are you can tell me, it's no big deal, my mind's wide open! - Fuck you, Charley, I'm not a fag. - Are you still a virgin, is that what it is? - Hey, man, I was with lots of womens, you know? - I've never seen you with one. - Are you calling me a liar or what? - Yes, I am. - Okay. - What are you waiting for? She's crazy about you! - Yeah? Who, who, Kochi? - Of course Kochi, you big Russian fruitcake! - Oh man. - What, you think no one notices? She only has to look at you and you turn into a grinning idiot! - Ah, I'm an idiot all the time. - Look, we don't know how this is gonna turn out, right? - Right. - This could all go down shit creek really fast. Make your move, you've got nothing to lose, stud. - Oh, man, yeah. (tense music) (air whooshing) (Charley yelping) (gunshots thundering) - Hold fire! (Charley panting) - The bloody thing bit me! - Sit down, we gotta stop the bleeding. Anybody got anything-- - Oh, Jesus! - We can use for a tourniquet? Sit down. Wrap that around there. Tie it tight, tight! - [Kadowski] Did you see it? - [Helen] It was like a ghost it was so damn fast! - [Sal] Where is it? - All right, everybody, you keep on your toes. Give Charley a hand here and keep moving. - That much will have to do for now, get up. (Charley grunting) (suspenseful music) - All right, we're gonna call it a day and we camp here. - Yes, because the last night we spent in the woods was so enjoyable. - What, you think tracking Scavs at night is better? - No, I just think if we carry on walking we-- - No one will leave camp tonight. - I think if we carry on walking-- - Well, I think we camp here and that is it. - Fine. ♪ Love is in the air ♪ - Not now, Charley, not now. (fire crackling) (crickets chirping) The Scav we saw today and the others that attacked us before, if the crystal's doing that to them, something tells me they're not gonna run away easily. - [Helen] What choice do we have? - Yeah, I know, I just wish I could get something out of the doctor. - Where is Reinold?

(Reinold breathing heavily) - Reinold, you creepy little bastard, where are you? I can't see shit! (Sal yelling) Help, help! (tense dramatic music) Doctor! Reinold, pull me up. Pull me up, you bastard! Oh shit! (Sal yelling) (eerie tense music) (Sal groaning) (dog barking) (dog snarling) (Sal screaming) (dog snarling) (Sal grunting) (Sal screaming) (tense music) - Sal? Sal? - Daniel, what's going on? - I told Sal to keep an eye on Reinold, now she's missing. (Charley groaning) Charley, have you seen Sal? - No, why? - She's missing. - Daniel, his serum vials are full, he hasn't been injecting his doses. - Damn it. All right, Sal's in danger and we need to go find her. Helen, Kochi, you break camp, Charley, Kad, grab a weapon, let's go! (grim tense music) Sal! - [Kadowski] Sal! - Sal! Sal! - Sal! Here. - I think you found something. - What is it? - Tracks. This way. (water splashing) - Why wasn't Reinold taking the serum? - I don't know, Kochi, I just hope Sal's okay. - Sal! Looks like we got a trail, boys. - Sal! Ah, shit. She's here! (grim somber music) (all grunting) - You all right? - Yeah. - [Kelly] Good? Hang on, buddy, hang on. (Charley grunting) You all right? - Yeah. - [Kelly] Good? Oh Jesus. - Where is Reinold? - Yeah, that's a great question. At least I got his scanner. - [Charley] We gotta do something. - All right. Helen! Oh, Helen. Come on, up, guys, come on, come on! (tense music) (eerie music) - Wait. This is for all of us. Yes, yes, this can save us. The humans are your enemies. The humans are close. I am Reinold, I'm a scientist. I can show you how to defeat the humans. I can show you how to defeat our enemies. - Sal? - Dead. - The dogs? - Reinold? - Missing. Scanner's working but I can't get a signal. Charley picked up some tracks so we at least have a start. - He was insane, maybe Reinold made the whole thing up. - Yeah, and what if he didn't? You've seen those new Scavs. We keep going until we retrieve the crystal. (dramatic music) Let's go! (tense dramatic music) (grim suspenseful music) (dogs snarling) - Kelly! (intense dramatic music) - Run! Run! Run! (Charley yelling) Get up, Charley, get up! - Get up! - Come on! Come on! Run! (Charley grunting) (dogs snarling) Come on, come on! (Kochi yelling) - Kochi! (dogs howling) - Hold. (dogs barking) (dogs howling) Hold. (dogs barking) Fire! (gunshots thundering) (dogs yelping) (gunshots thundering) (dogs barking) Now! (Kochi screaming) (Kadowski screaming) (dogs snarling) (Helen yelling) - No, no, no, no, no! Come on, come on, get up, it's too late! Go! Go, go, go, go, go! Get your ass up, Charley, Go! (dogs snarling) (dogs barking) (dogs howling) (suspenseful music) (Kelly screaming) (eerie whooshing) (Kelly screaming) (Kelly grunting) (tense somber music) (Kelly gasping) - How's the head? You've been out for a couple of hours. - Where the hell are we? - We had to find somewhere to hide from the dogs. - The crystal? - We're still getting a weak signal, though I don't know how long before I lose it. - I need to move. - Yeah. Damn it, the bleeding hasn't stopped. - How are you holding up, man? - Oh, that son of a bitch sank his teeth right in there. I've lost a lotta blood. I don't feel so good. - You'll be fine. - Fine? The blood's pissing out of me, look at it! - We have to stop it. - [Charley] No, no, no, wait! - Charley, you'll die of the loss of blood if I don't cauterize this wound. - Oh shit, okay. No, no, wait, wait, wait, wait. (sighing) Wait. - Suck it up, soldier. We don't need these bags anymore. (backpack thudding) (Charley groaning) - No, no, one more, one more, one more, wait. Oh God. Fuck! Fuck! (grim suspenseful music) - The signal's weak, but it hasn't moved in a while. - That's gonna be one hell of a scar. - At least you'll be around to show it off, Private. - Okay, what's the plan, boss? (scanner beeping) - Seems to be getting stronger moving further into the tunnel. (eerie suspenseful music) (tense suspenseful music) (guns clicking) - Oh my God. What are they doing? - It looks like they're praying. - So they are developing intelligence? Hey, hey! - No, no, no, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait. No, the crystal. - How do you feel? - Never better. (Charley grunting) (slow suspenseful music) (guns rattling) (air whooshing) - Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh! (grim tense music) (blows thudding) (Scav grunting) - What? (gunshots thundering) (blows thudding) (Scavs grunting) (Kelly grunting) (Scav yelling) - [Kelly] Whoa! (Scavs grunting rhythmically) (sticks thudding rhythmically) - Well, Sergeant Kelly. Are you the last two remaining? - Man, you look like shit! - [Helen] Why are you doing this? - As you can see, I was too late to be cured, but now I know the truth. - The truth is you lost your mind. We need this crystal. - You know what it means to us, all of us! - Don't count me in, you feeble human sheep. - Listen to yourself, Reinold, you sound insane. - No, I see clearly for the first time. (Scavs grunting rhythmically) Look at them, look at what the crystal has created. They are no longer the animals that you love to kill, Sergeant. - Look about the same to me, Doc. - No, they have become so much more. - What about everybody in the bunkers? - What about them? Humans created this virus and humans must pay the price. The crystal has come to set us free, Sergeant. The surface is ours now. My army will grow bigger and stronger and we will take our place as God's chosen children! (Scavs grunting rhythmically) (gunshots thundering) (Scavs grunting) (Scav screaming) (gunshots thundering) (Scav screaming) - Helen! (gunshots thundering) - [Charley] Go on! (gunshots thundering) (dramatic music) (guns clicking) (explosion booming) (explosion booming) (Scav screaming) (explosions booming) (Scav screaming) (grim suspenseful music) (Kelly yelling) (Reinold grunting) - Where you think you're going, Doc, huh? Huh? Let her go or I swear I'll smash it. - And risk the salvation of your pathetic race? I don't think so, Sergeant. Can you live with the death of your wife? (suspenseful music) Give me the crystal, Sergeant. - Don't do it, Daniel. (Kelly grunting) (crystal warbling) (blows thudding) (both grunting) (blow thudding) (Kelly yelling) (blow thudding) (Kelly grunting) (crystal warbling) (blows thudding) (Kelly grunting) (gunshot booming) (air reverberating) (Kelly breathing heavily) (Kelly groaning) (somber music) - Pain is a part of life and yours is almost over, Sergeant, but not before I kill your wife. Who's falling behind now? (gun clicking) (serum whirring) - Time for your shot, Doc. (Reinold wheezing) - Daniel! (skin crackling) God, are we ever gonna just have a normal life? - We can and we will. - [Announcer] Attention, attention. As of 1100 hours, all community personnel must evacuate the United Bunker. The last elevator to the surface is currently boarding. The bunker will be closed permanently. (pensive music) (eerie whooshing) - So if it's a girl, it has to be Crystal, right? (Kelly chuckling) - If it's a boy? - Daniel. - Daniel. Daniel's a good name. Strong, noble, tough! - Tough! (Kelly grunting) - Hey, what about, what about Cornelius, Cornelius Kelly? It's got a nice ring to it, don't you think? Well, suit yourself. - Well, whatever we call it, let's hope this generation learned from our mistakes. - Yeah, if we don't screw it up again first. - Oh, we will, we can't help ourselves. I'm afraid it's the nature of the beast. - Always a cynic, Charley. (eerie suspenseful music) (grim suspenseful music) (intense dramatic music) (intense energetic music)
