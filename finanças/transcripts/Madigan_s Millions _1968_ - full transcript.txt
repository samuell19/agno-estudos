[MUSIC PLAYING] [CHURCH BELLS RINGING] Hey! [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [DOOR CLOSES] You have a hell of a nerve coming in here demanding information about some of the garbage the United States of America chose to dump in Italy. Mike Madigan, American gangster. When you make these kind of people, keep them. Let them die in your own cities. He came here about 10 years ago. It's your responsibility to keep your own thugs alive, Lieutenant. He was an insurance salesman here. Do you think one of his clients killed him? I don't know. Then what do you want from me? I was sent here by the embassy. We're pretty sure we know why he was killed. Perhaps we can work together? Go ahead and talk. Mike Madigan was deported after being convicted of income tax evasion, a sum a little shorter than a million dollars. Yeah, we know that. The Treasury Department was never able to find the money. But we know he somehow got it to Italy with him. Uh. Look at his card. For eight years, he has been running a small time insurance agency in a third class office building. He lived in a cheap apartment. He ate in second class restaurants. We kept an eye on him. This man's a millionaire? We have information he got the money here shortly after he arrived. He had a drab girlfriend who also lived in a drab apartment. This man had money? Will you permit some of our treasury men to work on the case with you? You mean policemen with guns, slick Washington G-men, all suave and heroic? No, if I catch one of your people interfering for five minutes in this case, I'll lock him up. We could make a request through the embassy you know? You do that, Mr. Burke and you'll be sorry you did. MARK: Morning, Mama. Good morning. Are we going to get up now? Well, I don't think we have any other choice. What is this? I don't know. Are your hurt. No, I'm not hurt. Where does it come from? I don't know. You have a bad tooth? No, I don't have any bad tooth. Did you see someone here last night? No, honest. [BUZZER] What's wrong, Mama? Nothing's wrong. Then why are you crying? I'm not crying. Have you fed Rex? Yes, sir. From Rome. There's not much chance of getting investigators in there. However, we've got to get a man there. Undercover, I guess. I anticipated this. We haven't an agent in the department who doesn't look like a cop or isn't known to everybody as one of our men. This is budget time. Congress would murder us. [KNOCKING] J.P. OGILVIE: Come in. [BARKING] Am I interrupting anything, sir? Of course not. We like to have people come in like that when we have a serious problem. Sir, I've got the goods, sir, on the United Carbon case. Dead to rights. You must tell me about it some time. Right now, I feel a little ill. Is it anything serious, sir? No, nothing. Just a little indigestion. Psychosomatic. It's psychosomatic, sir. If you will permit me. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Sound body, sound mind. I do this every day to keep in shape, sir. My office is not a gymnasium. Stop that! I thought you said you were sick, sir. I did not! Did I? I think you did. [CHUCKLES] If you don't get out of my office. I can see that you're busy, sir. We can talk about the United Carbon case later, sir. Get out of my office, Foster. Fister. Fister. Yes, sir. Get out now! Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. [DOG GROWLING] [GROWLS] Thank you. Oh that, man. That man. I'll fall dead right at my desk and he'll be the cause of it. Why don't you send him to Rome? He's a screwball, but he's got a real nose for money. Don't you think he could find it? That's crazy. Could he find-- hmm. Might take him a month, but it sure would be quieter around here for a while. JASON FISTER: [MUFFLED SHOUTING] Let me out of here! In here. How'd you let him get in there just before landing? He's been in there since we left New York. Can't keep the passengers out of there, can I? JASON FISTER: You got to let me out of here! What he say? He said he's anxious to get out. I forgot to open the latch. Are you Fister? That's right, Jason Fister. How was the flight? All right. They get pretty confused in there though. Yeah? Yeah, something about the washrooms. They don't, uh, they don't know how to stick to the rules. You fly a lot? No, first time. The Treasury Department send me over to find Madigan's million. Was a tough trip. You know something? If there is a million dollars, I think I can find it. I think I'm the guy that can do it. I just have that hunch. This is your car. Sturdy. American? You want to drive? Of course. Of course. Sure. [YELLING IN ITALIAN] Just a minute, Fister. Would you mind showing me your identification? There you are. Passport, department ID. I even have an international driving license in my bag. Mr. Ogilvie gave it to me. Satisfied? I guess so. Wait a minute. How about your identification? I guess that checks out. We can't be too careful, can we? JASON FISTER: This is very nice. This is terrific. This is molto-- oh, no. Molto terrific. But, uh, a hotel would have been just as good, Mr. Burke, because I'm not going to be here very long. Fister, now let's get down to business. Here are the reports of the field men who worked on the case for the first time 10 years ago. Read him if you have time. There's where they found his body, under a billboard on a vacant lot. This is a list of the contents of his pockets and some photostats. Well, there's no million dollars here, huh? Will you look at the stuff and maybe come up with something? You'll be pretty much on your own though. The police here don't want any part of you. If you get into a real jam, we'll try and help you through the embassy. Oh, I hope you get your coordination working a little better after a night's sleep. Who claimed Madigan's body. I don't know. A couple of strangers showed up at an undertaker's parlor and paid cash for the funeral. The works. The big works. It's tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock at St. Augustine's church. I wouldn't go if I were you. Why not? Because there's a guy here called Arco who might not like it. Play it cool here, at least for a couple of days. I get you. Undercover. That's right. Undercover. Way under. [CHURCH BELLS RINGING] I'd like to have a word with you, lady. I said I want to talk to you. Leave me alone. You better come along, lady. Leave me alone. I said come now. Don't touch me! Take your hands off the lady, mister. What have you done now? Arrested some poor tourist for chewing gum in the Foro Romano? Ha ha. Follow me. In here. This fellow claims he knows you. Boy, am I glad to see you. This guy is a cop. Did you know this guy was a cop? They wouldn't even give me a glass of water, but I wouldn't tell them a thing except that you were a friend of mine. I'm sorry to admit that. This man is an employee of the United States Treasury Department. Washington cleared his working here with your foreign office. If that's so then why is he carrying a gun? He's looking for Madigan's million dollars. Oh, we're back to that again, huh? Whether you believe it or not, we're going to find it. Yeah, by pulling guns on policemen in the street? Oh, I can explain that. I thought you were a gangster trying to kidnap that girl. I just couldn't stand there and let you do that, could I? Yes. Well, what do you suggest I do with this madman? Turn him lose? Guess you'll have to. (SIGHS) Domenici. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Now, if you'll be good enough to give me my belongings, I'll be about my business and on my way. Grazie. Prego. No identification. Undercover. Hey, where's my gun? That I won't give him. Fister, let's go. I want my gun. Before he changes his mind. I'm innocent your hear. You're acting like a maniac. Oh well, out here, you gotta admit he does look a little like a gangster. Hey, that girl he tried to kidnap. That's the girl in the photo that Madigan had in his wallet. I remember her from the stuff that you gave me. Relax, Fister. Her name's Vicki Shaw. She was Mike Madigan's girlfriend. -Oh. -She's a widow. An American Air Force man who was killed in an accident about three years ago. She has a small pension. Madigan gave her a few bucks. Her address is among those papers I gave you. But she probably knows nothing about the money. She may have gone to Italy to live because she thought it was cheaper than living in the States. Have you ever been over to the office of that insurance agency that Mike Madigan ran? No. You want to go there with me now? Oh no. Will you take you over there? Just relax, Fister. Well, let's go someplace so I can get another gun. You must be out your mind. Why? I beg your pardon, sir. I wonder if you could tell me where 35 Via Verona Street could be. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] What are you mad at me for? I no parlo Inglese. Wait a minute. I don't speak Italian. I'm an American. Si, [SPEAKING ITALIAN]. -American. -Lei? -Me. -[SPEAKING ITALIAN] No, well. Si, [SPEAKING ITALIAN]. Via Verona. Scusi. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] The police station? [SPEAKING ITALIAN] But tell me. Can I walk there? Is it close? [SPEAKING ITALIAN]. Hey, mister. I speak English very good. Oh, good. Can you tell me where-- Listen. Could you tell me how to get to 35 Via Verona Street? For 100 lira I'd tell you. OK. Here you are. Well, where is it? In Rome. Yeah, I know it's in Rome. But where? How do you get there? That will cost another 100 lira. That's crooked. Well, where is it? It's near Via Carrolle and Via Frascati. Yeah, but how do you get to Via Car-- Carato? And Via? That'll cost another 200 lira. You've got a pretty good racket going here. OK, how do you get there. Take a taxi. Gimme my money back. Where? Where did you get that gun. Huh? Give me the gun for a minute. Wait a minute. I need it. I need it. [SPEAKING GIBBERISH] Taxi. Taxi! [SPEAKING GIBBERISH] Sorry kid, but you can buy another one with my 400 lira. Oh, I'm sorry if I got you up. You don't speak English, do you? I speak perfect English. What do you want at this hour? Well I-- I have an early dinner and when I am full and it's dark, I do what any intelligent man would do. I go to bed. Is there anything wrong with that? Oh no, no. I was just wondering, is this the office where the Palermo Insurance Agency is located? Listen, you should be aware of the facts, young man. The Palermo Insurance Service Agency is dead. Assassinated in the street. A murderer has been murdered. Is the office closed now? Of course not. One doesn't kill an insurance agency like one kills a man with a bullet. It will die slowly from lack of leadership. Very interesting. Could I get up to see one of the officers? No, it's impossible. Well, isn't there any way I could just-- I told you the facts. It is your wish to keep me from my bed for the rest of the night? -Oh no, no. As a matter of fact-- Then you will be good enough to permit me to retire and in the future please do not come here at the late hour. One must have a regard for even a portiere. Good night, sir. Buongiorno. [DOOR CLOSES] [GRUNTS] All right, the rest of you guys, I have a gun and I know how to use it. Line up against the wall, all of you. [DOOR CLOSES] Who the devil are you? Obviously, I'm the man with the gun. Put that thing down, you idiot, before you hurt somebody. If I hurt anybody it's not going to be me, is it? Now, I would like very much for you to turn around please, sir. Very good. Now, raise your hands over your head, please. Good. Now, I would like you to take the brim of your hat in both your hands. What for? Just do as I tell you. Remember, I'm the man with the gun. Very good. Now, pull hard. Harder. Harder. But I can't. It's cutting off my circulation. I won't be able to see. That's the idea. Pull! Very good. Now, just stand still and don't move. Now, raise your elbows up just a little bit, please. [SIGHS] John Locascio, attorney at law, Lake Shore Drive, Chicago. Attorney? Well, the law business must be in pretty bad shape if you've got to pull a caper like this. Do you think I'm a burglar? You're the burglar! I'm a burglar? Who came in sneaking around? This office happens to belong to a man who is now dead, you know. I am well aware of that. I'm his attorney. But who the devil are you? Never mind who I am. Did you say that who were Madigan's lawyer? You have my identification. Uh. You can put your hands down, Mr. Locascio. But if you put them down now just take it easy now. And if you're going to move, move slowly like it's a bad dream, OK? And you can take your hat off. But I can't! It's really stuck. I can't get it off. Wait, wait, wait a minute. I'll help you. [CLICK] [CLUNK] What's that? I didn't hear anything. Ow! Oh. Wait a minute. I'll have to get something and cut a hole in it. But I don't want a hole in it. I want it off. All right. I want a good look at you, so I can identify you to the police. Oh a stoolie, huh? A fink, huh? Ow! All right, all right. I'll just have to call one of my boys in here, and I'm keeping an eye on you while I go down and talk to the other boys, uh, uh, Red, Red, Red, Red, you want to come in here for a minute please? [FOOTSTEPS] Yeah boss, what do you want? Red, do you want to keep an eye on this stoolie while I go down and find out what the boys want to do with him. Right boss. And Red, make sure he stands right where he his. Don't let him move an inch. Right boss, I got you. And Red, don't talk to him. Don't talk to him. He's got a very tricky tongue and if he gives you any trouble, Red, just plug him. (LAUGHS) I got it boss. Just plug him. Now listen. Now, Mr. Locascio? Yeah. I don't want you to move, understand? Not one move. And don't think you can sweet talk Red. He's too smart for you. And besides that, he's a little crazy. [LAUGHING] A little crazy. Boss, you're a cod. [TELEPHONE RINGING] [SNORING] Hello? Uh, who, who is it? Hello? Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Fister. Fister, Fister, Fister, Fister, Fister speaking. Sleeping kind of late, aren't you? It's after 11 o'clock. It must have been the time change. What'd you do last night? I, uh, I went to bed early. BURKE (ON PHONE): You didn't go by the insurance office like I said, did you? Who said that? BURKE (ON PHONE): If you did, I suggest you drop by there again, see Lt. Arco. I'm sure he'd like to talk to you. Oh that. Well, I was just kidding around. Can't blame a guy for something like that. He can't? Not unless he doesn't have a sense of humor. Fister, you're something. All right. All right. I'll go right over there. My gosh, if a guy can't have a little fun in a town like this. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Say do any, do any of you fellows speak English? Yes, sir. I do. I'm looking for a Lt. Arco. I'm afraid he's too busy right now. OK, well, I'll see him later then. Wait listen. If you see him, tell him it was me that did that silly business up stairs last night in the insurance agency. That was just a gag. You know something about this? Yeah, it was just a bit of fun. It's the kind of thing that we do at home all the time. I'll see him around later. Wait a minute. I think he might like to speak with you. Me? Yes. Si, and-- You. Fister. Jason Fister. [SPEAKING ITALIAN]. [ITALIAN]. He says you want to confess. Oh sure. If you want to call it a confession, but we were just having a bit of fun. You should've seen his face. He was madder than hell. Who's that? That's the guy who was madder than hell. Is he sick? Ferme. Pretty sick. You want to see how sick? That's the superintendent. That was the superintendent. Avanti. What happened between you? Nothing. He didn't even want to let me in. So you killed him? No, I did not. He said he was tired. He said he didn't, he didn't get enough sleep. So you helped him out. That's right. No! He went back to bed and I just went upstairs to have a look around and then there was a burglar here last night. He knocked me down trying to get away. Then this lawyer came pussyfooting in there. So I didn't know what to do, so I drew a gun on him. Where did you get a gun? That's what's so funny. It wasn't even a real gun, it was a toy. I got it from a kid. And then this lawyer, uh, Locascio. John Locascio was his name, his pulled his hat down over his eyes, so he couldn't see. I don't know why he did that. We'll get all this down at the police station. First, I want you to see something. [ITALIAN]. Pulled his hat down. Pulled it right down over his eyes. Couldn't see. Pulled it. Was this the way you left it? No. No. There was a photograph on the desk. You better come with me. No wait a minute. I can explain. I'm sure you can. You know what I think? You're a lunatic! Come on, let's go. I didn't do, I didn't do this! Come on, let's go. Why won't you people listen to me! I think we've been listening pretty good, don't you? Now, you come quietly along with us and we'll listen some more. Why don't I meet you at the police station? See, that's my car there. If I leave it there, I'll get a ticket. Comisario. Who is this man? That's him! That's the guy, the lawyer, the guy I pulled a gun out at. You did a pretty good job. Is there something wrong with him? Yeah, the same thing that's wrong with the portiere. He's just a little bit dead. Gee, never did get his hat off, did he? You lost something? [EXHALES] Say, I know you. Where have I seen you before? Yes, and I know you too. And you are responsible for my being here. You held up that policeman yesterday. I still don't know why. That's right! I knew I knew you from somewhere. Hey, how are you? Hey, do you want to hear something funny? You know who that guy was that I pulled the gun out at? You know who? [SIGHS EXASPERATE LY] Isn't that funny? I thought he was a gangster trying to kidnap you. You have to admit it. He does look a little bit like a gangster, doesn't he? I thought he did. I still do. What did they charge you with? Murder. Two of them. I think. Well, the first one was said to be a joke. But it wasn't exactly a joke. I'm not going to tell them, but I'll tell you. Please don't tell me anything, huh? You don't think I could kill somebody do you? In cold blood? Listen. I only saw you once and you had a gun and you scared a whole crowd. But that was a mistake. Listen, I want to make you understand. Can I explain it to you? Please. Don't speak to me, all right? He'll see you now. Say, I know where I've seen you before. She's the girl in the picture, the picture that's missing from the desk. What are you talking about? The girl! The girl in the picture. She probably knows more about this than I do. Come with me. We will speak English, Mr. Foster. Fister. Yes. It is the same. You appear to be implicated in some serious crimes. Yes, that's very interesting because I haven't done a thing. In fact, Mr. Arco knows me and I'm sure he'll vouch for me. [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Grazie. Prego. What exactly are you doing in Rome, Mr. Foster? Well, now. That's supposed to be a secret. When we find you implicated in two crimes before you're in Italy 48 hours, nothing is a secret. He's an employee of the United States Treasury Department supposedly here to find a million dollars this Mike Madigan had hidden. And I'll tell you something too, I'm going to find it. Fortunately, or possibly unfortunately for you, we have recovered the weapon with which the portiere was bludgeoned to death. And we found the gun used to kill the lawyer in the seat of your car. These objects are now being inspected in our laboratory. Any information you may give us prior to the laboratory report will make things easier for you in the long run. Now, that's pretty fair. No honestly, I think that's pretty fair. In fact, that's pretty darn fair. Will you shut up and pay attention. I'm not going to say another word until I see an American lawyer from an American embassy. [KNOCKING] [DOOR OPENS] Signore Burke e arrivato. LT. ARCO: [SPEAKING ITALIAN]. You called me again, Lieutenant? My secretary said-- What do you have him in for this time? Two murders. Two? Two. Oh, did you bring a lawyer? Now, look at this. Isn't this ridiculous? This is un-American. It's the kind of thing that only happens in a foreign country. You know that to avoid problems later, I want you to verify that these are fingerprints taken from the prisoner before he was brought in here. Will you verify these please? Are these your fingerprints. Sure, that's me. That's my thumbprint there. And that's my signature right there. I have nothing to hide. Nothing at all. Our report shows that fingerprints found on the weapon are not those of the prisoner. I'm not at all surprised. Under the circumstances, Mr. Burke, we shall release the prisoner in your custody. We may require some further explanations. Fister, let's go. Grazie. Prego. Can I have my, uh? No, you cannot have your gun back! Maybe later. No. Maybe tomorrow? Never. Maybe never. Fister, let's get the heck out of here. Buongiorno. Mr. Burke, that girl. The one in the photo on his desk and in Madigan's wallet. I'll bet she knows where the money is. You've got her address, go and see her. Well, it's not that easy. You have to weasel information out of a witness. Well, go ahead and weasel her. Really? See you later, Mr. B. VICKI SHAW: What are you doing here? How did you get in here? Don't excited now. I, uh, I rang the bell. Nobody answered, so I just came in. I got your address from a friend of mine and, uh, look. Do you mind if I ask you a couple of questions? Listen, I don't know anything about anything. I don't want to know anything. Please just go away. It'll just take one minute of your time. Just two or three questions. Please? May I? One. One minute. OK. One minute. Thank you. Grazie. Lumps in the upholstery. Well, first of all, I'm not what I appear to be. Huh. That's yes. I'm, uh, you see, I'm a federal man. Federal what? Federal what? Federal man. US government, Washington. Here's my identification. That's the one. Huh. Kind of a GI, huh? G? Oh you mean G-man? No, not exactly. Well, not in the comic book sense of the word. I mean, I don't, I don't go around shooting people. I thought you were in jail for murdering someone. Two. Remember? But I'm out now, and I'd like to ask you a couple questions if that's all right. I see. I suppose you would like to know something about Mr. Madigan? Yes, as a matter of fact, that's exactly right. Why don't you start off by telling me where Mr. Madigan kept his money. Where do you keep your money? Me? In my pocket. Well, I suppose that he kept his money in his pocket. Oh, but he had a million dollars in cash. Really? Yes, we know that. That's a fact. That's not guesswork, ma'am. That's right. And we know all about you too, Mrs. Shaw. We know about you and Mr. Madigan. I see. We know that relationship. And what do you know about me and Mr. Madigan? We know that, uh, you and he, that you were his girlfriend, that he kept you. I see. We know that. That's, that's a fact. Boy, it's, uh, it's badly stuffed. You ought to have it fixed. Badly stuffed? This place is a dump! And you suppose that a man with a million dollars would keep his gun in a place like this? Yes, well, that may be. But we know for a fact that Mr. Madigan had a million dollars in cash. Listen. I don't know if he had a million dollars or not, but even if he had a penny, I wouldn't touch it. Now get out! Out! Out? Yes, out. Out? Yes. What's this? What is this? I don't know. I mean, I don't know. I found this in Mark's bed. But I didn't know about this. Did you find this the morning after your friend died? Yes, -Then he was here. -How? He was not here that night. -He had to here! -I swear. He was not. He was here but you just didn't know he was here. Listen, isn't it possible he might have left you something? Maybe. Do know anything that this key might fit? Does anybody? This is Mark. This is Mr. Fister. How do you do, Mark? Hi, Mr. Felster. Fister. Fister, Jason Fister. Mr. Fister! [GUN SHOTS] Oh boy. Am I glad to see you. The cops are after me again. I've been hiding all day. LT. ARCO: Buongiorno. No! You must like our police station. Let's go. What for? I haven't done anything. There hasn't been a machine gun fired in Rome since 1945. Until today! And you were there. You were driving a car this man got for you. I wasn't driving anything. I was just walking down the street. Then some guy took a shot at me. I thought it was you. Yeah, right outside Vicki Shaw's apartment. Vicki who? That's just what she said. Fister who? Well, I'm going to lock you up. If only for your own protection. You attract too much action for us simple Romans. Can he do that to me? I don't know. But I think I'm on his side. OK. OK, if that's what you guys want to play. That's where we'll play. But first thing tomorrow morning, I'm going to get in touch with Washington and we'll see who can do what to who. A lot of help you turned out to be. That way. Can I brush my teeth? I'd like to get my toothbrush. I mean, if you're going to put me in jail for nothing, I'd like to have a pair of pajamas and brush my teeth. All right, hurry up. Thanks. I can't find my toothbrush! I can't find anything! Ah! Are you sure you checked on this guy? Fister! [POLICE SIRENS] Hey, move fast, Mr. Foster. Come on, get in! Hurry! Don't you worry, Mr Foster. I'll get you out of here. You just relax. Fister. Say, how do you know my name? I know a lot of things. I've been keeping an eye on you for a friend of mine. If they get too close, you start shooting? That thing should stop them. Then that was you this morning? Yeah. I missed you, didn't I, buddy? You must think this hick town stuff is pretty tame for a tough G-man, hey buddy? Yeah. Where you going? Thanks for the ride. But no. I know a quiet little place right around the corner. You'll see some real beauties there. We could have a little talk and we could have a nice quiet drink together, hey? Who did you say you were keeping an eye on me for? My friend Mike. Mike who? You know there's only one Mike. Mike Madigan. Nice, huh? JASON FISTER: Yeah. Quiet. Buongiorno. CONDON: I've been watching you all day. I like you, Mr. Foster. I like you very much. JASON FISTER: Grazie. Signori. [ITALIAN]. I hope I didn't hurt you when I bumped into you last night. No, you didn't hurt me. When did you bump into me last night? Yeah, over at Mike's. You know, I couldn't be seen there. I just went over there to get the photograph of Vicki and a couple of other things. Oh, I see. Then I stopped you and you didn't get them. No. I didn't get a chance to. Then you killed the portiere! No, that was somebody else. Some fellow named Red. He works for Cirini. Red! Shh, yes. There is no Red! Yeah, sure there's a Red. I was keeping my eye on the place. After I saw you leaving, when Cirini and three other guys went in. The portiere went in next, but in a minute, Cirini and his boys came out with Locascio. He was mad. He had his hat pulled down over his eyes and he said, but why did you cheat me, Red? Why did you cheat me? And then Cirini hit him in the mouth. And the boys shoved him in the car. Oh my gosh! It's all fault. No, no, no. You don't understand. You were already gone for 10 minutes. We got to get the police! No! Don't forget about Cirini. You don't want to get him mad at you too. You already got the cops mad at you. Hey, Cirini. I heard that you were in town. CIRINI: Beat it. This is Mr. Foster. -Fister. -I beg your pardon. Fister. Mr. Cirini. I said beat it, Condon. OK, OK. Don't forget what I said. I like you. You like me too, Mr., uh, Cirini. I'm thinking about that. Look, you don't know about me. Oh, yes I do. Mattio Cirini. CIRINI: Matteo. Matteo. I know all about you and you have very interesting income tax returns. As I said, you don't know about me. Not really. I'm a business man. A nice fellow like a stock broker. I want to do some business with you. Well, I don't need any stocks. If you don't already know where that money is I think you might find out soon. What money, I? That money never belonged to Mike Madigan. It belonged to the boys and me who worked for it. Mike just took it back. For 10 years, we asked him for our share. But Mike was stubborn. He isn't going to be stubborn any more, is he? Poor Mike. The boys and I bought him a great sendoff. We're like that. We do the same for anybody. Even for you, Mr. Fister. Are you threatening me, Mr. Cirini? No, Mr. Fister. Years ago when I was in business, I learned one thing. You never tell a man when you're going to hit him. You try to talk sense with him, do business with him, but never tell him you're going to hit him. Well, I don't want to be hit, Mr. Cirini. But I don't think I could do business with you even if I wanted to. You see, if I don't like the looks of a man's income tax returns, I don't want to do any because with him. CIRINI: [LAUGHING]. You're funny, Mr. Fister. Anyway, I think that you and the girl know where the money is. Yes., well, it's important. Yes, please. Miss Shaw, I have to come and see you now. You have to let me see you. I know, I know you had nothing to do with that man who shot me outside your apartment. I know that now. Please? Thank you. Yes, yes, I'll be right over. Thank you. [CLICK] So now this guy Arco wants to talk to me. I guess he got the wrong impression of me at the beginning. And Mr. Cirini is sure that we know where the money is, so I have to find a place to hide. And to top it off, Condon, your bodyguard, is probably going to mow me down for coming up here to see you. My bodyguard? I told you I never had a bodyguard. Well, anyway. Where do you think you can sleep? I don't know. You can't sleep here. I know that. Mr. Fister? Mr. Fister? You're lying on my baseball bat. What? You're lying on my baseball bat. So that's what it is. Does my mother know you're here? Good morning. Good morning. Go and get dressed, Mark. I'm going to prepared some breakfast. The bathroom is there. You can use my toothbrush. Thanks. How did you sleep? I slept on his baseball bat. That was pretty silly, wasn't it? Are you going to move in here? Mark! OK, OK. Can I try it? Yes, sure. It's terrific toast. You know you shouldn't have gone to all this trouble. Nothing really. Do you have any children? No. I like kids, but I've never been married. I was married once and I mean, Mark's father died a few years ago. You know, this is the first time a girl ever fixed breakfast for me. No kidding. No kidding. Well, I guess I'd better be going. Well, good-bye. Thanks for everything. Hey, your hands are wet. Are you nervous? Little bit. Look, you better stay in the house and keep your door locked until I find that money. I don't think Cirini was kidding. OK? OK. Can you protect yourself? I mean, you have a gun? Well, I did have. The police took it. Listen, he left it here a long time ago. I hate to have it around. Thank you. You know, if there's one thing I know something about, it's guns. I once took a class where they had a moving target. They drew a gun on you. They said that I could outdraw-- Billie the Kid. Now it's Matt Dillon. When will you be going back? I hope soon. CONDON: You sure walked into the right spot, Mr. Fister. Condon, what are you doing here? You know what I told you. You weren't supposed to go see Vicki. No, I had to. It was important. Hey, get that thing out of the way, will you please? I waited and waited and you stayed there all night. You know he wouldn't have liked that. I mean Mike. No, I've been trying to find out about the guys that killed Mike. You see those things? Those are, those are, those are blood stains. Listen Condon, that print over there, right here, that's Mike's handprint. I gotta to kill you now, Mr. Fister. No, wait a minute. No, wait a minute now. You like me, don't you? Don't you like me? Now you said that you like me? Yeah, I like you. But I have to do my duty. Of course, you do. No, you don't. No, your duty is to avenge Mike. That's your duty now. Get it out of the way. I wish you'd have listened to me. Why didn't you listen to me? You're a nice young fellow. -Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Condon. Don't be crazy. Now wait a minute. Wait a minute. Sorry. [GASPS] [GUNFIRE] You're a lousy shot, G-man. Are you kidding? I could have put your eye out if I wanted to. I don't want to hurt you. Thanks. And I don't want to hurt you. [POLICE SIRENS] Get out of here! You better get out of here before the cops get here, Mr. Foster. Fister. Yes, I did. I sent him there. Mr. Fister is one of the best men in my department. He did? He did! My gosh. Miss Martin, put me on the earliest transatlantic flight to Rome. He's legitimate, all right. His boss says find him and lock him up until he gets back to us. I'll have every policeman in Rome looking for him until we find him. He's a one man crime wave. [PHONE RINGING] Hello Arco. This is Burke. My secretary phoned me and said she had just heard on the radio that Fister Madigan's money, had stolen it, and was hiding from the police. Is that true? (LAUGHS) Of course it's not true. There is no money. We know that. That is the details are not true. But it's true that it was on the radio. As a matter of fact, it will be in the papers tomorrow. Excuse me. Sure. You're excused. It was an accident. I heard about you on the radio. We figured you'd be coming here. You heard about what on the radio? We heard about you on the radio. Oh. Son of a gun. I have a better place to take you. Well, I guess if you just want to talk, my other business can wait. Upstairs. What'd you do that for? Are you crazy? Hey, what do you think, you're a wise guy? Let me at him. Hey, all right, break it up. Break it up. All right, Pastori, Easy now. Good boy. Easy. Good boy. [SMACKING SOUND] Look, he's getting away! [SHOUTING IN ITALIAN] [DOOR CLOSING] [SMACKING SOUND] I don't know why you make everything so difficult. All that nonsense downstairs. I just wanted to have a little talk with you. We just want to talk business. I am delighted you have the money. Now, all we have to talk about is your commission. Say 25%? But I haven't got the money. --[LAUGHS] Now, that kind of talk we don't like. We don't like lies, do we boys? These boys are very nice fellas. They are all dedicated to my happiness. Aren't you boys? They're nice, but they'd kill you in a minute if you made me unhappy. Me? I'm a family man. I couldn't kill a fly. Show him how you love me, boys. That should be enough for now. [GASPING AND COUGHING] CIRINI: I could kill a man if it was a matter of business. But it would have to be business. Like with Madigan and that lawyer the boys put in your car. They were crooks. You missed a little just below your lip. Now, we'll talk business again. All right, all right. You win. No. We all win. You still get your commission, you and the girl. But I have to take you to it. I have it hidden. Brady, go down and see if the lobby is clear. Pastori, you go get the car. Basilio, see if everything is OK. Yes, sir. You think it's OK I leave you here alone? Sure. We are partners, aren't we? Besides, nobody would want to see this thing go off, would they? Not me. I, uh, want to tell you something, baby. You better not be playing with me or I'll put this thing in your mouth and blow a new part in your hair. Hey, that's my tooth! Where? [SMACKING SOUNDS] You make one move, family man, and I'll clean out your nasal passages. Now, you do what I tell you to do when I tell you. OK, one wrong move by any of you, and this guy's head is going to be a wind tunnel. Do what he says, you hear. Now, I'm going to get some transportation. Now, I'm going to stop a car and when I get in it, you take off like the wind, because I'm going to start shooting at your boss. -Do it. He's crazy! If they get too close, you spray them with this. We can't let him get away. Not after 10 years of waiting. [GUN SHOTS] What's he doing here? He didn't want to come along and help, so I had to bring him. What are you doing here? Oh boy, oh boy. What are you and this mad man trying to? Get us all killed? I'll explain it to you later. [PHONE RINGS] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Now, now, Lt. Arco, it can't get any worse. They're having a machine gun battle on Via Veneto. This thing's no good! Put that thing away. [GUN SHOTS] Don't shoot any more. I don't have to. I just knocked out one of their tires. Hey, that's good. We disappear. We'll break up. Pastori, you get to the girl's flat and watch it. [INAUDIBLE] and Basilio, you keep an eye on Fister's apartment. If anything happens, call me at the apartment immediately. I'll be waiting. Now scram. You sure tied him up tight enough. Eh. Pretty good, eh? I used to sneak into Boy Scouts meetings when I was a kid. What do we do now, boss? Boss? Yeah, he could have killed me. Could have put my eye out. But he didn't. I like him. We got to get over to Vicki's, and make sure she's safe, and then we got to get her out of there. What about the police? Well, I think they got us into this in the first place. Well, that was a pretty rough thing to do, putting out the news that you had the money. Well, we've got to get over there. Are you going to come with us or not? Well, she is an American citizen. I guess I should tag along to see that she's all right. But that's all I'm going to do. Tag along. OK, come on. When you swipe a guy's cab, the least you can do is return it to him. Yes sir, Burke just walked up, and now he's going in the apartment. What? He'll come out with her in a few minutes and take her to see Fister. You get back there and follow them. Yes, call me again. All right. Good bye. Here they come. Now, see if you can fix it so I can have a minute alone with her. I'm sorry I had to make you come here, but I can't go near your apartment. I only came because I heard on the radio that you are supposed to have lots of money. I was very scared. I had to leave my boy with some friends of mine. I'll explain. Do you know Condon? I've heard of him. I've been looking after you, honey. I have to go wash my hands. Want to go with me? Not really. Unless you insist. Yes, I insist. Come on. You want to sit down? I just wanted us to be alone for a minute. There's a few things I want to tell you. I want you to know that I didn't do it on purpose. I wouldn't do that to you. I believe you. So I guess I'll be leaving Rome tomorrow. So now you're convinced the money's not here. No, I don't. But I guess I'm just not the guy that's going to find it. I haven't known you for very long, but I'm very fond of you. And I, Mark, he's a nice boy. I just wish that we had met on different circumstances, that you hadn't. You wish that I'd never been Madigan's girl, don't you? Why don't you say so? No, no, no, that's not what I meant. I meant that, that, that you hadn't, well, that I hadn't been such a boob, and gotten into so much trouble around here. So that, so then maybe you could like me. That's what I meant. I don't even know what your relationship with Madigan is. Well, I was Madigan's girl. I was his girl for years. Madigan was my father. I hate what he did. I loved him in spite of everything. See, you know he came to see us because he was afraid that some of his enemies would hurt us. Then when Mark's father died, he asked us to live with him. That's it. See? I have nothing to be ashamed of. BURKE: We have to go, Fister. We were just saying good-bye. I guess I'll have to leave Rome in the morning, huh? That's right. Then you'll have to find the money yourself. Here's where it was. I guess that's a key to Madigan's filing cabinet and that's a card with a message telling Vicki how to find the money. BURKE: You know you're right. It's in the filing cabinet. Let's go get it! Not there anymore. I just came from there. It's gone. But it must be there. Let's give it another try, right? Right. There. You see, it's empty. You didn't expect to find a million dollars in there, did you? Well, I expect to find something. Well, we tried. Wait a minute! Vicki! Vicki! V! V! V! V, V, V. Vicki, it's in a box under the sign. It's yours only, Dad. We go to the lot. Taxi! Hurry, get in! -No really. I'd rather not. Don't be silly. It's worth it! All right, come on. We'll drop you off. -No, no, no. Really, I want to go home. Condon, you go with her. All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right, listen. Be careful though. I'll met you at the flat later. Come on, you guys. Get in the cab. See you later, OK? OK. FISTER: Mr. Burke. Mr. Burke, ask him to phone Lt. Arco and tell him that we're here. BURKE: Are you kidding? He's looking for you. FISTER: In five minutes I hope he finds me. BURKE: [SPEAKING ITALIAN] Well, here we are. What do we do now? We get the money. Look! On the scaffold there, underneath the billboard. Do you see it? I think so. Come on Burke. This is it. This has got to be it. That's it! That's it! We found it! We found it. Now, I got to ask you like a good pal to throw it down here. Cut out the foolishness, Condon. I haven't got the time. No, you read Mike's message. I ain't fooling Fister. That money belongs to, belongs to Vicki. We'll talk it over later, OK? No, Mr. Fister. If you don't give me the money without no trouble, I gotta kill you fellas and take it away from you. Maybe I have to kill you anyway. You better drop your guns Condon. Cirini and his boys are right behind you. Look, you don't think I'm that stupid, do you? To fall for that old joke? [GUN SHOT] That was just to show you we mean business, Fister. Now, throw the box down and lie down on the platform. Either throw it down Fister or we'll come up there and kill you and get it ourselves. OK, OK, take it easy. Here it comes. OK, who's going to shoot first, huh? Are you nuts? Throw that gun down and throw the box down. No, I'm not nuts. For two days now, I've been shot at, chased, arrested, beat up, threatened, and I'm tired of it. OK? Who's going to shoot first? This money's going back to Washington, Cirini. OK. If that's the way you want it. Let him have it. Burke, down. [GUN SHOTS] CIRINI: Take cover. You're better than Matt Dillon. CIRINI: Can you see him? BASILIO: Not too good. CIRINI: Let him have it. He's just a lucky shot. [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] [GUN SHOT] Ah! What happened? I think I got another gun. Ow. OK. OK, wise guy. I don't like to use a woman. Now, throw it down and be done with it. Don't be silly! Geromano, bring her here. Get down. That's just what he wants you do to. CIRINI: Now, throw your guns down. We only had one. Throw it down! Now the money. Please do it. I don't care about the money. Please do it! If she opens her mouth again, slap it shut. Now the money. Give me the money! He wants the money. Now what's all this stuff about there not being any money? [POLICE SIRENS] [SPEAKING ITALIAN] You are under arrest! The safety of Italy demands that he be restricted by any means possible. He saved my life. I was there. Yeah, well I'm going to try and save my sanity. Come on. Wait a minute, wait a minute! I demand the right to talk to my girl. Your what? My girl. Oh, well, we Italians are not savages about such matters. In private. I'm sorry I had to say that you were my girl, but I wanted to make sure I could, that you let me say good-bye to you. It's all right. I don't mind. You don't? No. So maybe when I get out of jail, we can talk about it? Maybe. I got a pretty good job you know. And I'm Vicki, I'm single. Maybe you can come with Mark to Washington, visit for a while. They've got a terrific museum there. I like you. I don't know how to say I like you. You're very nice. We'll get you out of these things just as soon as we get down town. Your boss, a man named Ogilvie just arrived at the airport. Oglivie? I'll be delighted to see him. I'm on my way, Mrs. Fister. [GIGGLES] Wait for me Jason! [MUSIC PLAYING]
