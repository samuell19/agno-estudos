I don't like looking at him. Why's that, Senpai? Enough with "Senpai", just call me "Yoko" Then, why doesn't Yoko like looking at him? I don't really know... Sure. Absolutely don't serve that guy. Understood. Thank you. Yoko! What is it? Isn't something strange? In this town I mean... Is that so? You'll get weird people anywhere, won't you? This town isn't strange at all. Here you are, one hamburger. Please enjoy. There wasn't anything wrong with the man with no face, I tried to tell myself... Surely, that guy's just a person too. and yet... Welcome Have you decided on your order? Please ask me if you want anything. When I looked back, he wasn't there any more. But... Good work today, everyone. Then, he came... He had begun to follow me. Thanks so much! Do you want to come in? Oh, sure. My girl's name was Yoko. We were in the same faculty at university, she was older by a year. Go ahead, please come in. In my opinion...she was a beautiful woman. Is coffee alright? That is to say....without compare. Please, go ahead. Thanks. Seiji, is something hurting you? A little. I...can see it. All those things. A little. I...can see it. All those things. See what? What? Don't you understand? No no, I got it. Um, uh... That is to say... Like a spiritual thing? No not like that, as if you understand such things! I'm sorry...why don't you sit back down? Shut up you shithead! Every day....various stresses built up between us. Since that day, every day... that guy's been standing there. Because of him, I couldn't leave the house. Because...I was afraid of what he might do. Brother...I'm scared... It's alright, it's alright. So dark... Is that Ryuuta? What happened? It's a blackout. Oh, I thought I fixed the breaker. Didn't I tell you to fix the breaker? It's a blackout. Oh, I thought I fixed the breaker. Didn't I tell you to fix the breaker? Ah, so it's my fault? Whoa, look! Everywhere's dark! As I thought, it is a blackout! Maybe Mum can go get a flashlight? Of course, there was one around here somewhere... Hyperlight! Engage! Ryuuta, can you not shine that in our eyes? A bit lower please. It's blinding! A bit lower please. It's blinding! Hey, this is fun! No-one can see! It's like a club, everyone dance! Hey, this is fun! No-one can see! It's like a club, everyone dance! That's enough, Ryuuta, quit it! Stop it, Ryuuta. Come on...Ryuuta, stop it. Stop it! Well, alright then... What happened? Someone was there! What happened? Someone was there! Someone, you say... There's no one there... Wait, where's mummy? You're right, mum's not there.... Where's she gone? What is it?! Mum! Mummy! Mum! What is it? Mum! What is it? Mum, where are you? Mum? Mum, where are you? Mum? Mum! Where are you... What the hell?! Mum! Mum! Where are you? Mu- Who are you?! Dad! Ryuuta! Run! Hurry! Dad! Dad...? Mum? Run! Quickly! Hurry up and run! Hurry up and run, Yoko! Brother... What happened then? They found my father's corpse... My mum and brother's were never found. Since that day, I started to see various things. For example... A man who will soon die. A man who will soon die? It was you, Seiji. Stop it! Don't joke around! It's not a joke. I'm quite serious. Serious, you say... You don't have much longer, Seiji. Impossible... Not there.... A hand? No way! It's a fake, of course it is! I'll make certain... Ah, sure, I knew it! Something's touching my hand... Give it back! You shithead! Give it back! You shithead! You shithead... What's this? Some kid's thing? No way! Did that just happen? For real... Yoko? What's all this? It's your neighbour, she's... A heart attack, they say. There was nothing they could do for her... It's that emblem's fault... What emblem? I found it on my room's door. I thought it was probably some kid's thing. It landed on my neighbour's door. What kind of thing is it? It's a little thing. It looks like someone's face, I think. I see... Wait, where are you going? Work. It's me. It's ok now. Miss Yoko... Just Yoko's fine. Why are you here? I was on my way from work, I was worried about you! And... I was starting to miss you. Are you alright? Please rest for a little longer... I could get you an ambulance? This town is too strange! This town's coming for me! That's just not true. There's no need to be afraid. This town is.... If that's the case maybe you should just leave here! The town seems to be saying "die die die!" anyway. Miss Yoko... Die you idiot! I needed to escape from this city.. I couldn't do as Yoko said... Because... She went quietly past those two. No way! That's impossible. What is it? Suicide by hanging. What? That emblem.. Leave that evil thing alone. Wherever the emblem is stuck, it'll certainly...bring their end. In my house, there's dad and mum and me too. Also, sometimes...there's Ochanan. He comes out when everyone's gone. I'm the only one who can see him. Ochanan has a face like this... Have you seen this? Hmm. It's like this. That emblem.. Wasn't stuck there. Phew. ...it's....it's coming....it's...it's....coming... Takami! Hurry, run, please! Now! You've got to hurry! What? Not there... You haven't much longer... I will live! Absolutely going to live! Now! Hurry! Hurry up and run! Miss Yoko... Yoko's fine! You're not escaping? I... I'm not escaping... Why? I can't... get out from this town. Yoko... Farewell. What's that? What a weird emblem... See you... Farewell. I can escape from here, I can... Nice! I did it! Got out of there! I did it! But.. I lived... There were no more strange things in my life... I graduated university with Yoko. I married Yoko. We had a son. However... For a second time, grief would strike... Well then, well then, let's have a look... You know Ochanan, dad? Yes, ever since I was a child. This takes me back... So you've seen him then? You saw him too when you were young Seiji. So you've seen him then? You saw him too when you were young Seiji. So I shouldn't be scared? No, you've got no reason to be afraid. However.... This guy.... Be careful of him. This one's a bad guy? Exactly. This one's a bad guy? Exactly. If you see this one in the house be careful. This is the bad Ochanan. Well, I think you'll be just fine Daiki! I'll go check the breaker. How bothersome... Daikin, there's a torch in the kitchen. Go get it. Ok, I'm going now. Please wait a minute. Take care. I can't see anything in the dark... I'll come back now. Here. Thanks. It's probably the breaker, right? I'll go sort it. Is the battery dead? It's on! Ah thank goodness! It's on! Ah thank goodness! Alrighty... Ah thank goodness! Alrighty... What's up with this? Dad? Yoko? Daiki? Daiki... Where's daddy? It's alright. I'm sure it'll all be ok. Brother? Daiki! This terrible subtitle was brought to you by Chris Lloyd.
