IN CO-PRODUCTION WITH WITH FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM PRESENT A FILM BY It's broken. SILENT LAND When's he coming? Arrivederci! A problem with water. What water? He said they were having "a problem with water". Like everywhere. I wonder if I was too harsh with him. Do you reckon he thinks badly of me? No? I really like it when you're like that. You do? Besides, it's his job. We wouldn't make it in this heat without the pool. What was that? I don't know. Listen, maybe we could change them for ceramic ones? The door handles? Throughout the flat. Alright. - Sure? - Yeah. Hold on. I'll call Oleg. What? It's so late! I'll check if he's working. Call him tomorrow. You think? I keep thinking about that sink we picked out. Maybe we need to look for a smaller one. Why's that? - Because the one we chose is too big. - I want it. Unless we can find one just like it, except smaller. Exactly. So why do you insist on that one? Excuse me... Excuse me, madam... I need a hose... for the pool. I need a hose. For water. Water? I just need water... ...by the pool. I'll go and look for it myself. Just don't yell at me like I'm stealing things. Don't scare me like that. And why not? Because. - You don't want to try? - Nope. Maybe in the pool. In the pool. - You think he'll be done today? - Hope so. What is it? Nothing. Don't worry. Get dressed. Do you think he has a family here? Who? Him. I don't know. I'm sure he's got lots of horny brothers. You're dirty. Do we have any sugar? Ciao Riccardo, ciao Marco! - Ciao Fabio! - Ciao Fabio! Where is Giuseppe? On vacation, luckily. Marco, you just got promoted! Temporarily. So, what's for lunch? Kebab, sergeant. At least he managed to finish the pool. Does he have a family here? Who? Him? I don't know. Then maybe find out. We don't have time for cases like this now. Good. So, upon examination, I exclude any third party involvement. An unfortunate accident. Yes, yes, yes. OK, we're done here. You can dive in. They need to be taken to the station to sign their statements. Alright. Do they speak Italian? No, English. English? How do you talk to them then? Nothing? Coming, sergeant. Where have you been? - Hello. - Hello. Translate. I am Sergeant Marco Almani. I'd like to ask you some questions. Where were they when the accident happened? She was in the living room and he was taking a shower. Here? She was here, in the room. He was upstairs taking a shower. Did you hear anything? No. Only later on she saw him in the pool. And then she called her husband. I got it. It's all OK. Tell them to come with us. Now? Shall I tell them now? OK. They are at our disposal. Ok, we have to check the CCTV cameras. It won't take long. Riccardo, take them. Yes, I understand. Thank you so much. Bye. You were in shock. What? Say it again. You have to say you were in shock. She doesn't remember, she was in shock. Of course. Continue. Yes. He called Fabio, to get help. Marco, we've got a problem. The military took all the space. I'm just finishing. I have to go there. Tell them we have no more questions for today. And tell them not to be such tight asses. How do you say "rent a boat"? Quit selling them your boat trip. Ricca, where are you? I'm coming back, sergeant. Go to the town, old Carmello climbed up on the water tanker again. He doesnâ€™t want to come down. Just go there quickly. Roger that, sergeant. On my way. - Want anything? - No. I'll manage. I'm going to take a bath. - Is everything alright? - Mhmm. Drive. What is it? It's on the main road by the beach. - You must've driven past it already. - Ah, yes. - What are you doing? - Making plans for tomorrow. - What plans? - Ciao! You decided to come. That's great! You won't regret it. Adam, my husband, doesn't speak French. Sit down... He's clearly hooked you. Will you leave them alone? It's clearly pissing them off. - Everything is alright, yes? - Yes. Do you want anything? I want to go back right now. Why did you lie to them? I don't know. What time is it? We slept through breakfast. What now? I don't know. We'll have to plan lunch. What are you doing? Nothing. I don't know. Doesn't make sense. They're a strange couple, aren't they? Why? Dunno, I think they have some kind of problem. Why did you lie to them back then? There was no reason to do that. - I don't know. - What? I don't know. You're right. Doesn't make sense. But if you want, next time, I'll tell them what really happened. And what really happened, according to you? Why do you make me out to be a hero? Have you got a problem with me? We did nothing because there was nothing we could do. Nothing happened. What if they come back for us? For not helping him? Isn't there a law against that? Calm down. I've gone through it all. They can't do anything to us. It was an accident. He slipped, fell in and died on the spot. I called Fabio and he called the ambulance. We did everything we could, right? There's nothing they can do to us. Calm down. Besides, it's absurd. He wasn't even legal here. Remember, you were in shock. And you don't know how to perform CPR. Wait here, I'll go get him. The man at the police station said that you could have saved him. Did he also mention that you could have moved your skinny, pale ass and done something while I was trying to get help? He did not. Imagine that. - He didn't? - No. - Strange. - He didn't say that. Fuck! Want to say something? - No. - Then why are you laughing? Come on, tell us. I'm sorry, Adam has a hiccup. He'll gladly tell you. Maybe you want to say something? You crazy? It's like an internal hiccup. He gets it every time he fails at something. - Do you want some? - Yes. Here. Wanna go for a run? What are you doing? Going for a swim. - Maybe we could eat something? - Not before swimming. So maybe let's fucking talk instead. - Can we not do this right now? - So when? When I'm back. Good evening! How are you? Everything is ok? Hi guys! Do you want something? Give them two beers. - All good? Did it go well? - Super! You could've tried it at least. Take it! I'm going back home. - I'll stay with Claire. - As you wish. Let's leave this place. In any case, it should be a smooth, dark gray surface. - Adam... can you hear me? - Yes, I can. So what could've gone wrong? They might've used cheaper cement at the bottom and covered it up with a thin layer of the better stuff. It's easy to check. That cheap stuff is white. Just check it with a hammer. In every room. I see. - Adam? - What? The neighbors are complaining about the noise and the mess in the hall. Can you hear me? I can't reach Oleg on the phone. They're all going back to Ukraine. I saw the lines at the border on TV. We'll be back in two days, so I'll take care of it. Went by pretty fast, didn't it? Yes. I have to go. OK. Give Anna a kiss from me. Sure, thanks, bye. - "Give Anna a kiss". - What? Well, give Anna a kiss. What do you want from me? Do something. What do you want me to do? Do whatever. You could hit me, for example. You're weak, huh? So weak and scared. Scared of everything. - You're scared. - Drop it. "Drop it." Drop it, drop it, drop it. Adam? Is everything OK? Why so much food? Are we expecting guests? No, I'm making us dinner. Where were you? On the beach. Where are your shoes? Why does it matter? The best thing is, all I could think about was myself. When? This whole time. I don't understand. Ever since the accident, all I could think about was me. Isn't that normal, though? Me too. I guess everyone in that situation would think only about themselves. Adam, we didn't hurt anybody. Do you understand that? We're not bad people. We witnessed an accident. It was slippery. He hit his head. He died. We did everything we could. It's not our fault. It's not our fault. It wasn't an accident. It wasn't an accident? No. So what was it, according to you? You have no right to say that. What do you mean "It wasn't an accident"? What do you want to do now? What are you doing? You want to save the world, all of a sudden? Do we have to repent now? What can we do? What? You have no right to leave me. And why is that? What do you mean? Why not? Here. Call the police now and confess we knowingly denied him first aid. Do it. Let's drop it. I want to go home. You're right. Let's drop it.
