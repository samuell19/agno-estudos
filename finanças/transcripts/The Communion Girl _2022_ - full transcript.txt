Stop... My doll is lost. Her skin will be rotten by now. Stop. Stop. Stop. She's all alone. She's all alone and... and she's cold. Stop! How are you? Your mum said you got some sleep. That chicken looks good. I'm not hungry. How about we share it? It's just the lights, Sonia. Sonia. She's coming. Nobody's coming. You're safe here. Sonia. She was here. -Behind you! -There's nobody here. -It's in your head. -No! The girl is real. She's everywhere. She takes me to horrible places. -Put the fork down. -I don't want to! I don't want to. -I can't take it any more. -Sonia, calm down. I can't... I can't take it any more. No, Sonia. No! Sonia. Sonia! No, love. No, love! Help! Fuck! Somebody help! Help! Help! Help... THE LITTLE COMMUNION GIRL 4 YEARS LATER In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. -Amen. -Amen. -The Lord be with you. -And with your spirit. It needed a few more frills around the neck. No Mum, it's great. -It doesn't look old-fashioned? -No. No way... Excuse me. Excuse me. -Excuse me. -Look what she's wearing. -Excuse me. -She needs to sit down! Hi, how are you? ...subject to the commandments of God. Where the hell have you been? I've been working on the taxi all morning. ...and it should be celebrated. -Is someone taking us? -Tano. No, not Tano! Look. Salva's full up and Juanlu's wheels got slashed. Can't he fix them for tonight? He's flat broke, with what? Fuck... -I'm not sitting in the front. -That's the one condition. -Damn it, Rebe. -You're fresh meat, girl. The others are old news. If he touches me... We're meeting at 10 p.m. in the bar for a drink. Don't be late, your cousin will be looking for a ride too. -I'll do my best. -You'd better. Wear something sexy, it's not the seminary. What's your problem? Do you have a puncture? Miss Durán, you can't talk during the Holy Office. Come with me, please. See you there. Do you wish to participate in the Holy Eucharist by receiving your communion with your family members and friends here today? -We do. -We do. So you're happy in the town? Your job's not too hard? The company looks after us. I'm delighted, I hope it stays that way. Slaughterhouses aren't for everyone. But it's hardly a time for turning down work! Antonio and I are very grateful. Laura. Laura, come here. Come here. Come here right now. How many times have I told you not to go near the ruins? My friends are allowed... Well you're not. Play with the dolls, that's what they're for. And you, look after your sister. Or do I have to do everything myself? Come on. Come on! -Go on. -Let's go, Laura. What's she like? If she runs around like that -she'll lose the medal we got her. -She showed it to me, it's lovely. It's one of the best, 18 carats. Juan wanted a silver-plated one, I said no way... If it were up to them, the kids would do communion in tracksuits! By the way, your little girl's dress is beautiful. You can hardly tell it's from Zara. Judith loves it. She even wears it to bed. What did you give her? Sara! -Sorry. -Don't touch me! You'll make it worse. Holy mother of God, it's ruined! Don't worry, Aunt Teresa. That cheap polyester is easy to clean. -It'll be good as new. -Water. I don't want water. -Who wants a photo? -Me! And smile. Great. Next? Where's your doll, princess? Here. Put it between your hands as if you were praying. You'll look so pretty. Let's see you smile. Smile. Perfect. Next? So pretty. How about that? -Sara, leave her alone. -Mum! Was that fun or what? -Stop it! -That's enough, Sara. Have you seen my daughter? -I don't know. What's her name? -Marisol... Marisol Beltrán. She should be here. I don't think we've seen her... -You haven't seen my Marisol? -Marisol? She should be in the square. -I don't think so... -She's dressed like... like her, for her communion. -Do you think someone... -Come on, what are you doing? Don't worry. I'll let him know. Bye. Rosales has given us two more hours. -Damn. -From Tuesday I'm on nights all week. -I'll be on nights too then. -I know, I told him... it's no good. -We should talk to the union. -Yeah, right... Your sister will fire both of us, just what we need. Where are you going? -To the bar with Rebe. -Who's Rebe? Her school friend. The punky one? With all the normal girls in town you had to befriend that one. -Leave her alone. -What about her cousins? -Did you agree to this? -Dad, I told you days ago. It's fine. -But I want you back by 1 a.m. -No, not 1 a.m. Mum, it's not long enough. -How about 3 a.m.? -I want you home by 1 a.m. Or would you rather stay? Fine. Take the rubbish out on your way. -What's this doing in the rubbish? -I don't know. -This cost Dad a fortune. -I didn't want a rosary. I wanted a doll... like everyone else. Tough luck, Judith, this is what you got. Don't let me find it in the bin again or those will end up there too. Is that clear? -Don't take my things! -You're a shitty sister. Oh, boo hoo. Sara. What? I don't like this town. The people are weird. No, Judith. We're the weird ones. Fucking hell... Well, well! -What time did I say? -Sorry, trouble at home. -Go on. -Where's Tano? He's gone to get his car. Move it, or he'll go without us! Rebe, I can't keep up. Shit! Shit... Hey! -Get out! What are you doing? -Hey! Let go of the door, you'll break it. I'll break you if you don't get lost. Hey, stop it. All four of you can stay behind. -You promised. -You were late. -We'll find someone else. -No. Sorry, but you know... in love and war... -Take that. -You bitch! Love and war is one thing, taxi and disco another. Come on, Tano. Let's get going! -Drink? -Mixed drinks. We're going to the bathroom. -See you here? -Yes. Watch it, watch it. How's our strategy going? What time is it? -It's 11 p.m. -Right, 11 p.m. Number one: meet boys. From where? -From the city. -So they can get us out of this town. -Not Horta or Gandesa... -None of that. Valencia or Barcelona, at least. And quickly, in an hour or two they'll be messed up. Number two... Number two? Keep an eye on Tano so he takes us home. Pay him a visit every half an hour -and get rid of any girls... -No fucking way. That's the way it is, Sara. Number three? -Have a fucking great time. -Have a fucking great time. -Isn't that too much? -It's only half. Come on. Open. A 5,000 note? -Do I look like a bank? -Trust me, I'll pay later. -I don't trust anyone here. -Fuck, let's go. If you want... -You can pay me in flesh... -Stuff your pills up your ass. Rebe! Rebe. I love you so much, girl. You're the best friend I've ever had. I love you too! Sara, where's Tano? That fucking Tano. Run, Sara! Tano. Fucking hell! No, wait! No! Bitches! What the fuck do we do now? Please, please, please... Stop, stop, stop... Stop, you bastard! Fuck! Bastard. Couldn't your hookup have taken us. No, that asshole's still partying. We could go to the petrol station, there was a phone box. -To call who? -My dad. I'd rather get a telling-off than do a 30-kilometre hike. Really? And be grounded for a year? Rebe, they'll find out anyway... No, you can't call your parents. -Why? -Mine will find out and kill me. -So will mine. -No. You don't know what he's capable of, please. Thank you. Look, this is the one, I swear. We'll be home in no time. Stop, stop, stop. Please stop... Stop! -Yes, fuck! -Thank goodness... You just saved our lives... Let's wait for the next one. What if there isn't one? We can't get in there. -It'll be fine. You'll see. -Sara, wait. -Where are you going? -Wherever you want. Are you coming? You'll see... Let's chat a little. Otherwise I might fall asleep at the wheel. Nothing to say? Not even thank you? Nun school doesn't teach you manners? Thank you. That's right. Rebe has a tongue! She probably knows how to use it. How about a demonstration? And your friend? New girl at the office? What's your name? Sara. Her name's Sara and she's divine... How about we get to know each other better? End the night on a high. -Chivo, what are you doing? -Let's party some more. -Rebe, I want to get out. -Stop and we'll get out here, okay? Don't be silly. Leave you in the forest? We're gentlemen... Stop the car! Calm down, you'll have a great time. Touch a hair on our heads and I'll rip off your balls and feed them to you. -Chivo, get back on the road. -What's up, Pedrito? -Not in the mood for some fun? -It was a good joke. I was just kidding. I've better things to do than mess around with two kids. -You're a real bastard, you know? -Watch your mouth. -Watch my mouth? -As if I'd do that... Fucking hell, Chivo! Stop the car! -Fuck. -What was that? You scared me to death! -Didn't you see? -What? -Something crossed the path. -There's nothing there! We almost hit it! -It was probably a boar... -Dressed as a bride? No. It was a person, dressed in white. Why are you laughing? You're messing with me. What? I swear, it was there, it looked like a little girl... Who told her? Was it you? Why would I say anything? -What's he on about now? -Nothing. Please, tell me you saw her. -I didn't see anything. -Come on, then. Let's go. -What are you doing? -I'm not leaving a lost girl alone. -There's no girl! -Don't get out. -Sara! -Don't go! She'll get sick of it soon. Sara? Look on the bright side, some alone time. Seriously, Chivo. For fuck's sake. Damn it. Sara! There! Some village folk do that to dogs who can't hunt any more. Well, there's no girl here, right? Let's go. Come on. Wait. Damn it, Sara... It must be the girl's, she must have lost it. What? No, that doll's old. Just look at it. Let's see. -This shit's been here for years. -Who would leave that here? Don't know, don't care. -Take it away. -What's wrong? It's gross. Gross? You're shit scared... -Pedrito... -Stop it, Chivito, seriously. Stop! -Stop! -Can we get out of here, please? -And the girl? -What girl? -What if she's hurt? -No way, we're leaving. -Come on, mate... -You can hang around if you want but I'm leaving. Me too. -Hey, think it's the same... -Don't talk nonsense. Sara, are you coming? Why are you awake? Why are you wearing your dress? Why are you home at 6 a.m.? -Is that for me? -No. -Another girl needs it back. -Why? Because I say so! End of story. Back to bed. If you tell Mum and Dad, I'll kill you. If I tell them... they'll kill you. What do you want? -Is that your sister's? -She let me. Not at breakfast. -Morning. -Morning. Looks like you had a good night. -It was fine. -I see... What time did you get back? I'm sure it was after 1 a.m. She got back at 1:30 a.m. She woke me up, as always. I see. Don't let it happen again. If we say a time, be back by that time. Sorry. -Eggs, Mum? -Yes, eggs. Finish them up, you're skin and bones. Don't lend your sister magazines, they're full of half-naked boys with earrings and funny coloured hair. Gross! Sweetie? Come on! Another one, damn it! -Yes! -Fuck! -Five hundred. -No, rematch. -When you're having a better day. -I just need to get into it. No, five hundred. -Doubles then, it's cooler. -What a pain... -Sara, play with her. -Did she beat you again? It's like taking candy from a baby. How are you doing? I have a hell of a hangover... Have you slept? Not at all. -What's that there? -Nothing, I bumped it this morning. -Let's see. -No, it's nothing. Come on, let's play a game. Have you got five bucks? -No, I'm going to see Father Manuel. -The priest? Why? To show him this. Maybe he knows whose it is. Hey, Sara... we need to talk. You just got here, but that story has been told for years. It changes in each town, some say it's a bride, others say it's a girl dressed for her communion around this time. It's always the same shit. If you cross her path, you're cursed. -Cursed? -It's just to scare the kids. Rebe, something crossed the path. We were high, I'm amazed you didn't see a fucking unicorn. Why did Pedro come looking with me then? He wanted to get you alone. -What? -Yes... He likes you, girl. Don't be ridiculous. Ridiculous is you saying that you saw a ghost. Want people to make fun of you? Come on, then. Forget the fucking doll -and let's play a game. -Okay. You never hooked up with Juanlu? -No. We've known each other forever. -You liar! -You don't like him a tiny bit? -No way... Look who's here. You made it back? -Enjoy the excursion? -Yes, we did. Do that to me again, I'll break that cocksucking face of yours. Me? You're talking about yourself, that's how you pay your dealer. -Like her mum. -Take that back. Why? That's what your dad says... she went to Valencia because she'd already fucked everybody here. -You bitch! -You asshole! -I'll break your face! -Rebe! Listen to the outsider, you'll only lose. -You bitch! -Let's go. And you watch out. One word to my mum and your family's on the streets. -Rebe, wait. -I'm going home. My daughter's so happy. I don't know how to thank you, yesterday's mass was beautiful. How can I thank you? Yes, it was very special. It was a nice day and the kids had a great time. They love their first communion and the parents... -Hello. -Hello. What are you doing here, Sara? Hi, Aunt Teresa. -Thank you, Father. Really. -No. Bye. Can I talk to you? Yes, of course. Help me with this. When you can, tell your parents we haven't received the 700 pesetas for your sister's communion photos. -They must have forgotten. -Make sure you tell them. It would be a shame not to have a souvenir. Leave it here. Well, go ahead. I wanted to know if everything went okay at the communion. Did all the girls get home okay? Of course. Why do you ask? We saw a lost little girl yesterday on a path outside town. -She was dressed in white... -Those are tales they tell in town... Father, I know how it sounds but I swear we saw her. What's more, we found this in the middle of the countryside. Look. It must be hers. Do you recognise it? No. It doesn't belong to our girls, it's an old doll. But it's a communion doll. Maybe there was a communion there and... No. Ours was the only ceremony in the region. Anything else? No. Thank you. Go on, or you won't be in the mood. I only smoke dark tobacco! Where were you? With Sara. -Who? -I'm going to make dinner. Another beer first. -I'm not in the mood! -I haven't started yet. Where are you taking me, Miss? -Juan, the pill! -They're leading you astray! -The pill's in my jacket. -I can't! -What are you doing? -None of your business. -Can I have another magazine? -No. -I've read this one twice. -Third time lucky, then. Sara! Mum! Sara! Sara, what's wrong? Mum! No! Can you hear me? Sara! Sara, sweetie! Sara! Sara! Sara, sweetie! What's wrong? Sweetie. What happened? Sara, are you okay? The doctor will check you over tomorrow. There's no need, Mum. I'm fine. We need to find out why this happened to you. My blood sugar's probably low. -I just fainted. -Do you think we're idiots? I wasn't born yesterday. I didn't mention it earlier, I thought you had one drink too many, which is unacceptable but we've all been teenagers... But this? What was it? Ecstasy? Amphetamines? I didn't take anything. I've seen what that shit does to kids your age! Antonio, if she says she didn't, she didn't. End of story. I'll ask you one more time and you'd better tell the truth. -What did you take? -Nothing, I swear. Fine... you're grounded for one month. -Come on, Dad! -Shall we make it two? Off you go! If I tell my parents what I saw, they'll lock me up. Could it be the pills? The come down can make you paranoid... but only if you take a lot and we only took half, so no. Nothing's happened to you? No, nothing at all. Your wires just got crossed, that's all. -It's nothing. -That's not all, Rebe. Look. I have some strange marks. They won't go. What the fuck is it? This isn't normal. No. Ecstasy doesn't do that. Could it have been cut with something bad? Maybe we're reacting to it. Who sold them to you? Fucking kids, get out of here. Away with you, now! Off with you! I'll rip your heads off. Have you no respect? You two again? Can you fix it? They put it on the tracks to make it look like this. Bastards! They snuck in the other day too, I'll catch them. -I don't sell dodgy shit. -What's this, then? How should I know? Nothing to do with me. -Maybe you didn't notice. -Impossible! -How can you be so sure? -I try before I sell and I'm fine. Maybe it affected us differently, we're not used to it like you... Calling me a junkie? -I didn't say that. -Look... It could have been an allergic reaction, a bad trip, something like that. Anything... but it's not my fault. Did you mix it? Only with drinks. Well, and the joint. -What joint? -The guy you hooked up with. I don't remember a joint. Could that be it? Of course. What was in it? Check out you nuns... addicted left, right and centre. And I'm the junkie? Drug lesson one: they're like sex and friends, not to be mixed. -If you can't do that, don't do them. -Let's go, girl. -Hey. -What? Forgotten something? Maybe "I'm sorry"? Fuck off, Chivo. What should we do? -Go to the doctor? -No. If it's what we took, when we've pissed it all out we should feel better. I don't know, Rebe. You've got more important things to do. -Leaving already? -Yes. You haven't had a game? I don't know much about these machines... and I have loads of homework. -Come when you're done. We can have a drink. I can't. I'm grounded. If you change your mind, I finish at 10 p.m. Hey, Sara. Did you find out anything? -About what? -About that doll. No. Okay. Bye. It smells so clean and the clothes are so soft... Fuck! It's cold in the middle. I've told you not to put the flame so high! Can't even fry croquettes! -You were rushing me... -So it's my fault you're useless? Your mum and I are both working nights from tomorrow. You'll have to make Judith's dinner. Dad... Sara's cooking sucks. -Watch your mouth. -You'll eat what she makes you, okay? It's time for bed. Come to bed. Make sure she goes to bed on time and make breakfast for her. We'll be exhausted. A beer please, Juanlu. -Will they be long? -They just got here. Damn it... Gross. Excuse me. What do you want? Paper? Asshole! What the fuck's wrong with you? Are you taking the piss? -Hello? -Sara, you were right. Something bad's happening to us. I don't know what it is but it's like you said. What happened, Rebe? I was in the bathroom at the bar and I swear someone was there. And suddenly, it closed... It closed and she wanted to hurt me. She really wanted to hurt me. My doll is lost... Sara? She's all alone and she's cold. -What then? -Sara! What then? Rebe! Her skin will be rotten by now. -Where are you going? -Something's wrong with Rebe. She'll be fine by herself. -Dad, please! -You're grounded! Want another Super Pop? If Mum and Dad ask, tell them I'm studying. -Not to bother me, okay? -Okay. Rebe! Rebe! Please, wake up! Rebe! Rebe! Stop, stop, stop... Stop, it's me. It's me. Please stop, Rebe. It's over, it's okay... What happened? -She attacked me. -What? What? The girl followed me. What? She was choking me. Suffocating me. What if it's true? What if what they say is true? What if all of this is real? Rebe, we have to warn the guys. Can you walk? Quickly. Quickly. -Everything turned off? -Yes. Coming to the bar? -What about the new girl? -She's not into me. Hey... can I crash here tonight? Had another fight with your parents? I'll have to start charging you rent! -Come on... -It's a joke, mate. Chill out. You can always count on Chivo, okay? Thanks, mate. Take a look at the million machines, a couple are wobbly. See you, mate. Turned everything off, my ass. Fucking hell. Who's there? I told you I'd get you! Whoever's doing this, it's not fucking funny! Fuck! Calm down. It's all in your head. It's in your head. Fucking hell! Call an ambulance! Chivo. Chivo. Chivo... I don't know what to do. What? What? The girl. He just started to swerve and lost control. I see. The neighbours say he took all sorts. -Is that true? -No. I don't know... -Didn't you say you know him? -But not much. Chivo! Chivo! What the fuck happened? I was with him an hour ago! Fucking hell... No. He can't be dead. Fuck. That girl you saw. I thought it was something else, that it couldn't be true. But it's happening again. What do you mean? A few years ago, some girls found her too. Two sisters, the Muñoz sisters. Ring a bell? I'd heard something at school, but... -I thought it was made up. -Yes, we've all joked about it... -But that was different. -Why? They started saying the girl showed up everywhere and wanted to take them and hurt them. And not just that. They had strange marks on their bodies. Look. Rebe has them too. Are they still here? -We could talk to them. -Sara. The Muñoz sisters are dead. Dead? They committed suicide. We could ask around. Maybe Aunt Teresa knows something. -Sara... -Or your dad... Your parents think you're on drugs. If I tell my dad all this... No. No way. -What do we do then? -One of the sisters had a boyfriend. -I'll go see him tomorrow. -We'll come. Don't you have class? Fuck it. Dad. Off to bed. Off to bed, Dad. Come on, Judith! Move your ass! It's almost 9 a.m. Ready. And your backpack? Come on. Let's go. Sara, do you have a minute? We're late for class... I heard you were there when that boy had his accident, the arcade game one. -Yes, I was nearby. -Did you know him? -No, why? -You were with him and Rebeca... I didn't know him. Sara, when you arrive in a new place, you should choose your friends wisely. Do you understand? Yes, perfectly. Hope your classes go well. -Why did Aunt Teresa say that to you? -Because she's an asshole. Come on, Judith. Damn it! Off you go. Well I never! Look who's here! -Why bring all this up now? -Tano, it's the truth. Bad things have been happening to us. -Like your girlfriend and her sister. -This isn't funny. -Listen to us... -Get out of here! Hang on. Look. Why do you have that? You recognise it? It belonged to Sonia when it happened. What happened? They went crazy, that's what. The girl's real! They suddenly said the girl followed them, that they had visions and other shit. Doctors said it was psychotic episodes from drugs. They took medicine but nothing helped. No! Sonia, no! The next day, her sister hung herself. The doll disappeared, no-one knows how. They say it belonged to a girl who went missing -during her communion. -Yes. They looked for her, but... What was her name? I don't know. Ask the priest, he knows what happened. That bastard priest lied to me. -Why would he lie? -I don't know. You wouldn't forget that, it was less than five years ago... Father Manuel? Hello? Father Manuel? -Sara, can we go? -Hang on. When is this from? 1982. Why's Father Manuel watching things from 1982? I don't know. Hang on. That's it. It's the doll, right? Let me see it. Look at the marks. COMMUNION CARD, 1981-82 She was called Marisol. Marisol Beltrán. Let's see. We have to go. Please, let's go. The girl's here... No! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! Pedro! -Rebe! -Sara! Sara, are you okay? Come in. Let's go. -Pedro! -Pedro! -Pedro! Open up. -Pedro! -Pedro! -Pedro! Pedro! Pedro, wake up! Pedro! -Pedro! -Pedro! Pedro... Pedro. Father Manuel had them too. He was looking for the girl too. What was she called? Marisol Beltrán. At my sister's communion a woman asked about her. And Father Manuel knew her. -Remedios? -She didn't say her name. She goes to all of the communions looking for her daughter every year. We need to talk to her. Where does she live? A farm on the outskirts, but... -it's not a good idea. -Why? Everyone says the dad killed the girl. -Her dad? -Yes. Fucking hell. Rebe? -Why the fuck aren't you at school? -I'm going to the clinic, I'm sick. -You think I'm an idiot? -Rebe's telling the truth. Am I talking to you? No. Shut your fucking mouth. -Home with you. -I'm going to school... You sure are, you won't miss another day. -Watch it, sir. -You stay out of it. If I see you with her again, I'll break your face. Leave it, Pedro. I'm coming! -Will you tell me the truth now? -I swear... -So you're skipping class now? -I'm not, I swear! Is that why I break my back working? Is that why I pay for nuns' school? For you to waste it all? And all to meet up with that junkie's friend. -Are you fucking him? -He's a friend... -Don't lie to me! -I'm not! I didn't raise you a liar. A whore who lets anybody fuck her like your mother! Mum didn't let anyone fuck her. She left to get away from you. I wish I'd done the same! -Where are you going? -Let go! You're going nowhere until you tell the truth! Open the door! -Stop, Dad. -Open up, fuck! Rebe! Rebe, open the fucking door! Open up! Open up! Please, stop! Rebe! -Stop! -Open the door or else! Open up! Get out of my life! Open the door, Rebe! Fuck, Rebe! Rebe! Rebeca! Rebe... Rebe! Rebeca! This might not be a good idea. Wait, don't get out. Shut the fuck up! Let's go. Sara, if he catches us... Come on. No, no... Sara. Sara! -Pedro, look. -What? She hasn't got the marks here. Why are you here? -Who are you? -Sorry, the door was open... -You can't just come in... -Our car broke down. -You can't be here. -Can we use your phone to... -...to call someone. -No, you can't. -Please... -Where's the car? Just outside. Please. Fine. Come on. The phone's here. Come on. Thank you. Hi, it's me. The car's broken down again. That's right... I don't know. I guess it's the engine. It's been playing up for days and... it's packed in. She's so pretty. -Your daughter? -Marisol. I have a sister her age. It was her communion last week. Weren't you there? Where? -My sister's communion. -It wasn't me. Okay. Yes, you were. -You asked after your daughter. -You're wrong. -No, I'm sure... -I said, you're wrong. Your friend's taking a long time. Santiago! -No, Remedios. -Santiago! -Remedios! -Let me past! -Santiago, please! -No, please, Remedios... Marisol! What's this? -Yes... -You must be suffering too. Did your daughter suffer a lot? My poor child. They all laughed at her. -Who laughed at her? -All of the other children. -Their parents too. -Because of the marks? Because of the marks. They can be cruel in this town if you're not like them, right? They said she was a monster when they were the real monsters. You can't do that to a child. -What did they do? -Made fun of her. Called her names. Spat at her. They didn't want to touch her. Not even touch her. You loved her, didn't you? She was an angel. She was an angel. An angel that God gave us. And her dad? -What? -Did he love her as much as you? -In the town, they say... -It's nothing but lies. Santiago adored her. -But... -He never hurt her! -He loved her. -So what happened? -Someone took her. -Who? I don't know, someone saw her alone and took her away from us. My poor child. What did they do to you, Marisol? Remedios. What was she doing when you last saw her? What? -What was she doing? -Shit... Playing with her doll in the square. We took our eyes off her and never saw her again. -We have to go. -No. -Was she with anyone? -No, she was alone. -Where? -In the square! -Where exactly? -In the ruins. Sara, let's go. Come on. Remedios, listen to me. We'll find her, I promise. What's going on? Hey! What are you doing in my house? Come here! -Run, run, run... -Hey, you! Hey! Get in. Quickly! Hey, you! Where are you going? Hey! Stop! Hey! Stop! Santiago didn't touch her. Someone took her. How? The whole town was there. I don't know. Maybe it was one of them. -Someone from the town hurt her? -We won't know until we find her. -Can I make a call? -Of course. This way. -Mummy, isn't Nancy my best friend? -Well, sweetie... Nancy has so many lovely things and so many beautiful dresses... -Hello? -Judith, put Mum on please. They're not here. They went to work angry. -Where are you? -At a friend's house. If they call, say I'm fine. -Something urgent's come up. Are you with a boyfriend? -I'll tell them everything tomorrow. -Okay. -You'll still get told off. -That's my problem. Go to bed, it's late. Hey, Judith? -What? -I love you, okay? Okay. Is your sister okay? -Rebe? -Rebe? -What happened? -Whose blood is that? Look at you... -Rebe. -It's okay. I almost killed him... What happened? I almost killed my dad. Here. I can't take it. I can't take any more, I can't see her again... -I just can't. -Rebe. Rebe, listen to me. Listen to me. Calm down. Remedios said the girl went missing in the ruins. The answer's there... somewhere. When we find it, we're done. This will all be over. You'll see. Hear that? Water. My doll is lost. She's all alone and she's cold. Her skin will be rotten by now. Sara. Come on. It's here. The girl hid here. Here. I've been here. -She must be here. -Sara, wait! Shit. No! Fuck. Sara! Get me out of here! Hang on. Rebe, get me out of here! No, no, no... No, no, no... Nobody wanted to touch her. Nobody wanted to touch her. Sara! Sara. Sara, are you okay? Sara. Good night. Good night, Rebe. See you tomorrow? Hey... sure you don't mind me staying here tonight? Of course not, as many nights as you need. Let's go. In the city where the events took place there's a monastery famous for its catacombs, built by the Greeks. Where have you been? What are you doing awake? You're filthy. Off to bed, go on. I can't sleep. Do you want a hot ColaCao? Okay. I'll bring it to you in bed. Go on, then. We were already the weird ones, but look at us now... Don't worry. They'll go in time. You'll see. No, it's not that. Something doesn't make sense. Why would the little girl leave the party in the square to hide down there? Maybe she was playing hide and seek, Sara. -I don't know. -No. She wasn't hiding. It looked like she was following someone. Someone was enticing her. But who? I don't know. Don't touch that doll! -Why? -It's not yours, I've told you. Sara... What? Her arm. Come on, quickly. Shit! Why is this happening again? I don't know. I don't know. -We didn't free ourselves of Marisol. -What? We freed her. From whom? My doll is lost. She's all alone and she's cold. Her skin will be rotten by now. What have you found? Drop it, Gris. -Give that here. -Dad! -Dad! -Hello. Look what Gris found. Can I keep her? I don't see why not. -See you later. -Bye. -Bye. -Let's see. It's really old. Bye! Let's go.
