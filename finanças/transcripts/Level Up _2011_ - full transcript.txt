[beeping] **** [dance] ** And when I'm at work, they think I'm a jerk ** * But I'm down to get it done Say What? ** Don't need to talk back or overreact ** ** Homie, hold your tongue ** I got it under control ** I got it under control [Electronic Voice] Launch procedure. [gasps] Five, four... three, two... one... Launch. [school bell ringing] [grunts] Ahh-- Oh, sorry, Angie. Sorry. - Sorry. Sorry. - Nice one, Wyatt. - Making a movie? - Yeah. Sociology project. I have to make a short film on a unique and interesting aspect of high school life, if I can just figure out how to work that thing or settle on a subject matter. - You know? - White balance was maxed out. Oh. Thanks. I don't know if you knew, but I'm captain of the three-peat State Champ Quiz Bowl team. You should, um, do it on us. Like a tribute film. You know, I would, but four people in my class have already asked for that topic. - Really? - No. It doesn't really meet the interesting requirement. Sorry. Wha-hoo! [whoops] How do you like me now? [whooping] Yeah-- Ohh! [grunting] - [students chattering] - Whoo! Yeah! You see that? Dark emotions. You get that shot? [Boy] Yeah. Dante, you want some attention? - [whistling] - No, I'm good. - My office, now. - You got it, V.P. Trust me, the Quizinators are way more interesting than they look. ** I'm the one, the ace, the only ** ** I'm the king * ** I'm the one, the ace, the only ** ** I'm the king, ooh, yeah ** Yo, Lyle, what'd you think of that game last night? Aw, man, it was sweet. I slayed, like, three gargantuan-- You slayed? [scoffs] You're not still playing that lame video game, Nerd Quest, or whatever? What? N-- No. I meant I watched Manning slay the Jets' gargantuan secondary. - Right? - Yeah. Confident? Please. The only real threat is Council Rock Tech, and they're, like, a clan of level 6 Newbs trying to raid an Elite Orc Camp in desperate search for the Pouting Rod, okay? Everybody knows you gotta be level 45 to do that. Hold on. - [grunts] - [scoffs] Zoe, uh, we still on for that thing later tonight? If by "that thing," you mean you tutoring me while my dad pays you, then yes. Sweet. Um, I was thinking maybe... Yeah, she said no. - Why, actually-- - Uh, no means no, dweeb. So you should quit with the stalking and get. - Hey, freak. - Mannequin. - Knob. - Chafe. Good one, Dante. Die, quiz clown. All righty. He jests. When I get into high school, I'm gonna cheat. Not if you wanna go to MIT. You don't have to spell it. Besides, I'm going to a party school. How come you're such a drag? I have plenty of fun, okay? Not with humans. Here's an idea. Shelly Nolan. She's a human. A little splotchy but gettable. It's a start. Yeah. Unfortunately, girls treat me like I'm a Maniacal Banshee of Death, which would be great if I wanted to date a White-maned Wolveress, but not so great if I was dating an actual person. Look, can you just go to sleep and let me get my game on so I can be appreciated somewhere for an hour? Shelly Nolan, dude. Don't mind the back brace. Blast-a-ton. [typing] What's up, ladies? That's right. Black Death is back. There he is. How's the world's best half-time speech writer doing? He's, uh-- He's doing. Good. Glad to hear it. You're not playing that game again, are you? Lyle, let me tell you something. Nobody ever made it to the end of their life and said, "I wish I were a bigger nerd." Just trying to help. Oh, and don't forget. I need you at the rally next week down at the dealership. I'm trying out the new slogan. "Hugginson for mayor, a family man you can wrap your arms around." That means the family represents, okay? Good talk. [door closes] [typing] Thunder Pole. What's up, Black Death? Where's Bickle at? [sighs] I thought we had a contract. That you forced me into, Barbara, after I shaved the class bunny in third grade. It's "Mom," and don't deflect. This is about your impulse issues. - And the contract-- - Is over seven years old. I signed it in crayon. Look, I know you think everything is a big joke, but I am juggling brochures from five different boarding schools right now. All of them would be more than happy to help you - ...with your self-control problems... - And take your money. if you hit three strikes. Now, how's the homework? - Is it done? - What homework? Oh, my God. Computer off. Get to work. Game on. Skull Cracker. Yeah! [Lyle] You're late, Bickle. [Dante] Yeah, my bad. My bad. - I was just-- - [Wyatt] Whoa. Whoa. Zip it, okay? No sharing of personal details ever. Ruin the whole dynamic of the game. I was just gonna say I was busy making out with your mom. - [laughs] - [Wyatt] Rule number 4: If you're gonna slam another player, at least be funny and not use a joke my dad used in the '80s. ** Raise your goblets high Hey, Bart. Can we lose the entourage, Death? ** The hero has returned Seriously, turn your Bieber off. He's my bard. It gives him pleasure to sing about my exploits. And I can't help it if the ladies love me. I'm a straight pimp. What? ** He stands beside his friends ** ** With honor and with might - ** He fills my lute with tingles ** - Dude. ** All the day and all the night ** Oh, wrong. Very wrong. Fine. Sorry, man. This is gonna hurt me way more than it hurts you. [whirring] Whoa. Is that a new quest poster? [Wyatt] I think we have ourselves a cheat code. - [Dante] Pop it in. - I'm way ahead of you, bud. - Wow. - Cool. Just give me a second while I can check the boards to see what-- Leroy Jenkins! And he jumped in. Awesome. Why does he always do that? Trolls! [Trolls growling] - Tulta Munille. - Tulta Munille! [screaming] Watch this. Haley's vomit! That's what I'm talking about, Wizza! Where are we anyway? I could've told you if you waited for me to look it up. Waiting sucks. NeverFail's one of the most elite clans ever, because we don't think, we act. [grunts] Nice. Cha-ching. And done. What? You guys see this? It must be a beta test level. [Dante] Dude, let's check it out. Maybe it's where we find the weapon we need to fight Maldark. Okay. I'm pretty sure the location of the all-powerful weapon to defeat the final boss of the game wouldn't be all glitchy like this. Yeah, but it might have a big old dragon. - [Dante] Let's go get it. - [Lyle] Whoa. Hold on. [all] Tulta Munille! Wizza, help me lay down some suppressive fire. Sir, beat him down on the inside. Okay, on my mark. And now! [computer voice] Kilauea! Kilauea! - That's nice. - We pull back? [Wyatt] No retreat. Oh! [laughing] - Yeah! - Huzzah! Oh, gee. That deserves something so much cooler than a "huzzah." - That was sweet. - Treasure time. [Dante] Give me that. Come on. Come on. Stupid beta. I'm clicking the rod, but it's not giving me my lollipop. - Weird. - Maybe if we try it together? [Wyatt] Control, alt, push, guys. [Dante] Click harder. Click harder! [electricity arcing] - Huh? - [arcing continues] Come on. Give up the loot. [computer voice] Ah, the loot. You desire a petty trinket, do you? Well, on this day, - the treasure is greater than you could ever imagine. - What? Uh, the game just respond to me? Must be why the cave's so janky. Programmers were concentrating on the interactive AI. Cool. Who is this AI of whom you speak? - Maldark? - Can't be. We're ten levels from the final battle, and we don't even have the weapon. - Who cares? Let's get him. - Wait! Fools! [Dante] Come on. You dare to challenge me? Stand aside. I must sound the horns of war and prepare the assault on the world you have just opened up for me. - Oh, expansion pack! - [both] Expansion pack! So this is some sort of viral marketing campaign. I see. Place the cheat code and lure us into the cave. Very clever, guys. Prepare for your doom. The conqueror of all worlds is upon you! [sinister laughter] - [electricity arcing] - Wait. What? [Dante] Ah! Barbara? **** [romantic] What's that? Cops. - Sorry, Officer. We... - [Troll growling] [both screaming] [Boy] Did you see the news? - What are you talking about? - When bears attack, man. [Anchorman] Homework turned to horror for two students. They drove here to study for a biology project when their studying was suddenly interrupted by a terrifying bear attack. [Boy] It wasn't a bear, okay? It was some type of monster with a club and claws, and it came out of this portal thingy. Why would a bear wanna steal my cell phone? It's nothing more than two kids who banged up their car, and they're looking for an excuse to cover it up. There are no bears in Daventry Hills. [Anchorman] Police released a sketch of the rogue bear and ask if anyone sees it, to please call animal control. Sweet mother of pearl. That's no bear. That's a fricking troll! What? Troll? [chuckles] We should fricking roll. [Dante] This is crazy. [Wyatt] What happened here? [Lyle] Seriously, what is going on? [Wyatt] Word is Maldark and his army rolled in and destroyed everything. Are we sure they're not just launching a new game or an add-on maybe? By enslaving and burning and pillaging and killing off people's characters. Who would wanna play that? Yeah, when you can sit at home on your couch and watch trolls on the local news. What'd you just say? Uh, nothing. No. No, you definitely said something. Okay. No, it's-- It-- This is-- Last night, we had a power outage. Okay? I mean-- It was nothing. May-- Maybe there was a-- Freak troll assault? Oh, Lordy. Where do you guys live? America. North. Daventry Hills. You gotta be kidding me. Me, too. Wonderful. We're neighbors. That's-- That's fabulous. So should we start preparing for our doom now? Because I think we just released a monster from a video game. - You're crazy. - What? No way. We need to meet. I.R.L. Tulta Munille. Tulta Munille? [chuckling] Oh... - Oh, come on! - Wow! - No, no, no! No way! - This is unbelievable! - Oh, man! - Wait. This criminal and you? Black Death...in the flesh. Big pimp, huh? Which makes the QB Wizza. You're the honorable knight, Sir Bickle? I guess that's just in the game. Awesome. We're all super-secret computer buddies. Let's buy a van and solve mysteries. [imitates Scooby-Doo laugh] What are the odds? Yeah. I don't know, geek, but I'm sure you just love to figure them out. I'm the geek? You're a level 68 sorcerer who still says "huzzah." I mean, what if your O line knew about that? They're never going to know. You know what? This-- This is a waste of my time. Yeah. I don't think you wanna do that. If something's going on here, it could get traced back to us. Yeah, that doesn't work for me. Okay, look, chances are, it's nothing. But you gotta admit, it might be kind of cool if it is, right? What are we looking for anyway? I don't know. I never got my troll tracking merit badge. - Oh, no? - No. How about footprints? A trail? [squelch] Or that. - Ohh. - That's a lot of scat. - Gross. - It's this way. - [creature growling] - [animal squealing] And it's a troll. [belches] [groans] Maybe we should call the cops or the zoo or Peter Jackson. You know, let him digest his pig. That was a pig, right? Wouldn't it be cool if it was real? Okay. It's a level 2 swamp troll from the Alpha Clan with an apprentice war club. Let's just bum-rush this turd and take him out, all right? Whoa. Hold up, Hitler. Why are you calling the shots now? - Because I'm the leader. - What? No, you're not. Okay, I started the clan. I organize missions. I solve the puzzles. Besides, I got a bard, four wives, and mansions in three provinces. So I'm pretty sure that puts me in charge. Okay, so what's your plan, almighty leader? Bum-rush the turd on three? - Whatever. - Great. All right. One, two-- Leroy Jenkins! [all yelling] [screaming] Retreat! Oh! [groaning] Run! [yelling] Down! Down! I think I literally have a stick up my butt. Hey, man, we need a different game plan. Yeah, well, switching plays ain't gonna cut it, champ. - All right? Maybe if we had a weapon - [thudding footsteps] from the game, we could dispatch that fool, but... Your mom's 3-wood? We're gonna need a bigger boat. So let's get them. - What? The weapons? - Yeah, I admit, okay, it might be impossible, but think about it. That guy got out, right? And he's just programming code. Same as our weapons. Hey, the portal. You think there's a way that we can reopen that? Worth a shot. [troll belches] What if he can smell us, man? What are you doing? Man, are you hacking the game? Okay, I'm simply doing some packet editing which will allow me to scan and reconfigure certain variables within the program. - What the what? - He's hacking the game. Why didn't you say that? One small step for gamer, one giant leap for gamer-kind. Ooh! Ooh! Okay. So, that's worth a "huzzah." Huzzah. What do you want me to bring out? You kidding me? Everything, dude. Yeah. Whoa. [typing] Aah. [whoosh] [metallic clattering] Yeah. Maybe we should just stick with our primary weapons. Yeah. [whirring] Man, I don't know how to work this thing. How do you do it in the game, Lyle? Uh, I hit a function key on my computer like the rest of you. Doesn't your character say some crazy stuff before you fire? - Like some sort of incantation? - No. No way. Man, that's totally lame. - [troll growling] - Yeah. Come on, tough guy. Embrace your inner geek and cast away. [flatulence] Haley's vomit. [whirring] - [growling] - Oh! That was a bad idea! Why don't you say it like you mean it next time, huh? Work the blades and go, "Chops a lotta!" Hey, man, I would if I could! - Okay? - [roars] It's on like Donkey Kong, big guy! [yells] - I can't feel my hands! - I can't shoot him! This thing has, like, a hundred types of ammo! I don't know what's gonna come out! - I don't care! Just do it! - [whirring] What? Come on! - Hurry! Hurry! - [yelling] - [applause, cheering] - What? We didn't even win anything! No! [whirring] - [barks] - Ohh! - Oh. - A dog? [whines] - [panting] - Ahh. - [ferocious barking] - [gasps] [roaring] - Yeah! Get him! - Kill him, boy! Haley's vomit! [whines] [Boys yelling] No! His collar! - My bad! - [roaring] [Boys screaming] - [roars] - [Wyatt screaming] Save the geek, save the world. Save the geek, save the world! Oh, you hurt it! That's what I do, baby. [laughing] [yells] [groaning] My arm. [groaning continues] Wyatt, do something, please! - I don't wanna die, Wyatt! - [weapon whirring] [screaming] Yeah, eat it, troll-holio! Hey, is it dead? Please be dead. Please be dead. - [groans] - Ew. Gross. What are you doing? Looting the Jolly Green Giant, my friends. You see? A leather glove. I can flip this. - To who? - I don't know. The local armor? We're not trying to level up our characters here. [roars] [Boys yelling] - Kill it! - [yells] Oh! Ohhh! Whoa. Double whoa. I think we just sent this back to the computer world. Yeah. [laughing] - Oh. - Ohhhh! My old friends, Wizza, Black Death, and Sir Bickle. [chuckles] What have you done with my scout? We sent him packing. Mm-hmm. We sent his big fat avatar butt right back to the computer world. Buh-buh-bye. Arrogant fools! You have no right to stand in the way of my destiny. Prophecies written foretold of my legend. [breaking up] Your powers are no match for mine. Soon I shall have harnessed all the energy I need - ...to deploy my armies- - Sorry? What-- And I'll crush your world comp-- Blasted place is killing me here! S-Sorry, "Maldork." Looks like a glitch now. - Time for a reboot. - Wait. And the crowd goes wild! It might've been helpful to ask him a few questions before you bashed him away, don't you think? Sounded to me like he was planning something. Yeah, well, it's done. Finito. Kaput. Here you go. Jeeves, bring the car around. That works for me, man. I gotta bounce. - Peace. - Wait. So, that's it? We're just supposed to go back to our normal lives? [Dante] Let me tell you something, Wyatt. Unless you can pull a Ferrari and Megan Fox out of that portal, then, yeah, it's over. [school bell ringing] [Man] Click me to take a survey and enter to win a brand-new MP3 player.

Yep. That's right. I got a bard. If any of you realized how redonkulously awesome I was, you would be singing my praises, too. Yep. **** [romantic] [mouths words] Hey, Zoe, uh, sorry. Sorry about last night. We should probably have a make-out-- make-up-- make-up-- redo session. You know, you, me, and a math book. Oh-- Oh, he's not-- He's not gonna be there. You're not-- You're not coming. Sorry. Fine. But blow me off again, and I'll ruin you more than he just did. Could you stop doing that? - How did you even do that? - [bells jingling] Not a really-- Not a really good time. [mutters] Yeah! [electricity arcing] [car alarms blaring] [Man] Click me to refinance-- No, I don't wanna refinance my home. - Click me to refinance-- - Get away. - [Man] To refinance, click me-- - Ohh! - [alarms continue blaring] - [groans] Beautiful things are afoot, Dante. I heard some seniors even got chased in the woods by Grim Reapers or something. - Crazy. - [click] It's crazy time out there, Wyatt, and not just game stuff. I swear I saw some pop-up ads jacking some old lady in town. That weird "click me" guy? And the chick in the bikini. There's a chick in a bikini asking people to click her? - Double click. - Okay, okay. It's gotta all be connected somehow. It's like-- It's like when we pushed the rod in, we let Maldark loose in our grid. Now he's just toying with us. No. No, he's testing his powers. - Hey, look. The jock talks. - Bite me, Wyatt. You know, it's totally acceptable for you to not insult me in school. You know what? If I didn't insult you, then people would actually suspect something's up. Like what, you're semi-human? What happened to you? We used to be friends. I know it was in elementary school, but we had friendship bracelets. Yeah. Whatever. Man, I'm missing practice. [phone beeping] - Oh. Not good. - What's up with that? It's an app that detects leaks from the computer world. Wrote it myself. I got two pop-up ads, a bard, and three mystery creatures. What are we looking for anyway? Eyeliner Trent said Grim Reapers. Ghouls. Nasty. Lyle, don't you have a "find undead" spell? Hey, jackhammer. He's talking to you. Gratefully Undeadicus. [whirring] Oh... **** [bard whistling] You've gotta ditch that dude. I would, but it's kind of nice having someone around here who knows that I crush it. - Yo, Wizza. - Lyle. [whispering] Lyle, I'm thinking something fire or air-based. Ghouls are highly susceptible to elemental-- Dude, I got a curfew. Right. Perimeter positions. Tulta Munille, guys. Tulta Munille. ** When minions at the show-- [muffled singing] Guys. [clatter] [growls] - [grunting] - **** [suspenseful] [grunting continues] Whoa! Stay back! - [growls] - [Blast-a-ton whirring] Hi-yah! [groaning] Sorry. There's no auto-aim. [whirring stops] [groaning] Do something! [yells] Agh! [yelling] - [ghoul groaning] - [screaming] Nice one, Lyle. Fujita bonita! [sinister laughter] [grunting] Ow! Owww! Whoo! [grunts] Man! [chuckling] [grunts] [Wyatt] Stop him! Yes! [laughs] Why do you peasants insist on tormenting my minions? Why do you insist on sending them? I conquer all worlds. 'Tis what I do. Resistance is futile, for soon I will be able to harness all the energy necessary to leave this pathetic realm and unleash my armies in full. [yells] [Lyle crying out] [Wyatt] Drop it! Drop it! - [panting] - Cool? - Uh, yeah. - Okay. - Oh, man. - [rattle] And cut! All right. That's a keeper. Hey, sorry about that, little guy. We're just, uh, making a hidden camera short for the Inter-Webs. Uh, great job, by the way. Talk about Drama Club. - Yeah. - A.P. Yeah. Are you cool to be in it? Great, man. I love the team spirit. You are a star, okay? I'll see you in the halls. You little A-lister. - Good thinking. - Yeah. Okay. ** Once again we see * ** How evil, it hath fled ** Shut him up, get rid of him before I break his head ** I'm serious, Wyatt. Drop the hippie. He could've gotten us killed. Okay. I'll get rid of him as soon as you stop acting like a madman. You gotta think before you act. There's no re-spawn in real life. Come on. Man up. Honestly, man, this-- this is gonna hurt. Dude, I feareth. - [whirring] - Look, a vampire bat. [blast] [Dante laughing] He turns into cards. Wow. We're doing better, but they're getting stronger. So how do we get off this ride? Just log on and take down Maldark there. Not an option. We don't have the weapon to take him out. We need Max Ross. - You're nuts. - He created the game. We all know he lives in orbit on his own space station. That's an urban legend. He's in cryogenic freeze under Bill Gates' house. Okay, guys. His company has a server farm right near here. - Okay? We can find him. - [beeps] In the meantime, we just need to destroy whatever leaks. As long as my mom doesn't destroy me first. I gotta go. I'm sorry. I really gotta go. Really? It's after curfew. You didn't call. You didn't answer your cell. Hey, I looked into your homework file. You haven't even started the essay that's due tomorrow. Strike two. Dude-- Barbara-- Mom-- You want strike three? Who's Max Ross? Just-- Just a guy that I'm doing a report on. - You're acting suspicious. - Hmm. I suspect you. [beeping] ** Whoa * [Anchorman] Residents of Daventry Hils are once again on pins and needles after a recent series of bizarre events rocked this normally tranquil town. Whatever it was tore the satellite dish off my RV, tried to eat my tool shed, and left a crop circle in my pachysandra. The mayor's office continues to receive reports of other odd incidents, including sporadic power outages. The power company and local police insist none of the events appear to be related. - Do we have to? - We have to. ** A-one for the money and a-two for the show * ** A-three to be a leged even if I'm poor ** ** I ain't chasin' nothi', you gonna have to catch me * [explosion] It's okay. She probably had a virus anyway. * I'm the bomb and about to blow up * * I'm the bomb and about to blow up, whoa * [Anchorman] Late last night, members of a local scout troop filmed strange explosios in the Daventry Hills Campground. It's an alien invasion. Lock up your women. [phone beeping] Oh, boy. ** I'm the bomb and about to blow up ** ** I'm the bomb and about to blow up ** ** I'm the bomb and about to blow up ** [roars] [all yelling] ** The devil's been in downtown for too long * ** I feel the sun rising all up in my bones * [phone beeping] There seems to be no end in sight to the strange occurrences in Daventry Hills. Reporting live outside Xander's Computer World, Te-- This campaign speech is killing me. Why don't you just write it from your heart? Remember when we used to play that card game, Ani-Warriors, at recess? And that one time, those fifth graders came up and said that Ani-Warriors was for babies. You stood up to them. You gave them that awesome speech about how cool the game was, and if they ever had a chance to take down an armored Zebra Tank with a Rolling Wombat, they'd know better. Seconds later, they were playing, too. You can still do that. [sighs] No, I can't. Why not? Because I'm not a child, Wyatt. There's expectations, implications. There's gonna be a lot of people watching. Maybe you should just write down whatever you think they wanna hear. You're really great with that. [typing] What? What? I think I just found Max Ross, and he's practically in our backyard. You think this guy's gonna be cool with us just rolling up on his McCastle? Absolutely not. But it's not like we really have a choice, right? Right. [Man] No solicitors! You have two seconds to vacate the premises before I unleash the hounds. [scoffs] Hounds. We're not selling anything. We need to speak to Mr. Ross about Maldark. Max Ross doesn't do autograph, he doesn't give free hints, - ...and he won't do interviews for any lame geek-boy fansite. - Lame? That's it. - I'm done with this guy. - [yells] - [grunts] - [yells] How did you do that? You with DARPA, huh? You with the feds? I know you've been after me for years, man. You've been scanning my brain. I have heard the helicopters, and I have seen the chem trails! - Yeah, that's-- that's not us. - [whirring] Then how? Level 65 door-be-gone spell. Using a...Thunder Pole? - Such a-- - Yeah. Don't touch me. Thank you. Huge fan. Not touching. No, no. You don't understand. I mean, whatever caused these anomalies didn't come from within my game, it came from without. - Don't touch that! - But Maldark seems to be controlling everything. Probably is. - He's a brilliantly programmed evil genius, - [crash] thank you very much, seizing a golden opportunity to act on his core objective-- conquer all worlds. And guess which world is next. Ours? Rhetorical, idiot. Of course ours. You mean that dragon we slayed was some sort of in-game visualization of the firewall? So that means when we pushed the rod in-- You opened up a gateway for Maldark's computer world to our world. Hard to believe, but he might be an even better programmer than I am. Wait. He thinks he's a programmer? Have you even played the game? - Yeah. Of course. - Yeah. Rhetorical. No, lightweight. He thinks he's a wizard manipulating magic. From the sounds of it, I'd say you only have a few days before he finds a computing power source juiced up enough for him and his army to come out and join the fun. - [cow lows] - [Wyatt] This orb must be some sort of sensor that guides him to the portal's hot spots. Figured you were the smart one since you didn't get the looks. Thanks? So then that's what the ghouls were looking for at the school. Ghouls? They didn't suck anyone's soul out, did they? - [cow passes gas, lows] - No. Good. Don't ever let them suck anyone's soul. - What? - Do you realize that your game is trying to destroy our world? You know, you say that like it's a bad thing. What? Look, in my world, people are forced into action and become heroes, and they are properly rewarded for their hard work. Out here, life is boring, life isn't fair, and life blows hot chunks. Besides, while I'd agree that Maldark is a cruel and blood-thirsty leader, he's also incredibly efficient. I mean, sure, those of us he doesn't kill will be enslaved. - [laughs] - Can't you just shut the server farm down and end this? And interrupt the gameplay of tens of thousands of subscribers? A pox on you for suggesting such a thing. Not that it would have any effect. He's no longer confined to the game. Haven't seen any sign of him for a few days now. He's kind of just... floating out there. [Boys gasp] Do you think he'll wanna meet me? [shells clattering] Ten. Okay. Stop the car. Stop. Stop it! [tires screech] [growls] Wait. Wait! [yelling, faint] Here you go. - [troll growling] - [Dante yells] Come on! Take that one! Take this one! - [electricity arcing] - How do you like that, fat boy? What are you doing? Come on. Let's just go. Selling the idea of family values is tough when the whole family doesn't show for the event. Dad, I'm so sorry. - I mean, if I could-- - Stop. No more foul-ups. Now, this is a close race, and the outcome affects your future as much as it does mine. So I need you to step it up, especially on that half-time speech. - Got it? - Yeah. Yeah, nice play there, Carter, man. [Players chattering] - I'm out. - What? Lee's car was strike three. - I leave in a week. - Wait. Okay, you can't quit. We still have-- My mom is crying, Wyatt. All right? I'm not a hero. [scoffs] I'm a disaster. Even when I try to do what's right, I still screw it up. - Yeah, I'm out, too. - Are you kidding me? - Because I know we can still do this. - Do what? Have our lives completely ruined? If that's what it takes. Truth is, in a couple days, we might not even have lives left to ruin. Maldark's coming. Oh, fine. I just think if we were in the game, we wouldn't give up. We'd put our heads together and start acting like a clan-- Man, but this isn't the game, geek. And there is no clan. Don't you get it? It's over. Let someone else figure it out. - [electricity arcing] - [thud] [heavy breathing] [gasping] [growling] Sprague? [roars] Don't touch me. [creature growling] What are you weirdoes up to now? [beeps] Oh, my God. [whip cracks] Oh, my God. Yo, there's a splotch-free cupcake at the door for you. - There's a who's-a-what's-it? - A chiquita. I know. I'm as surprised as you are, but if you don't jump on this, I'm breaking out my birthday money and making it rain. [stammers] Tell me I'm hallucinating. Tell me that I didn't just film a bunch of... I don't even know what to call them. Running off with that guy from your report. Because you know what? That is exactly what it looks like, and it is really freaking me out. You're hallucinating. I am not. You're involved, aren't you? I knew it. - What's going on, Wyatt? - [stammering] - [imitates stammering] - Oh-- Fine. Sprague and his Imperial Council of level 75 Dread Orcs just kidnapped Max Ross, the creator of Conqueror of All Worlds, which means that Maldark's not far behind. Which is why they probably need Max. To open the final portal. I'm gonna need a nerd translation for that, please. Where were they headed? Uh, uh, towards that giant warehouse near my neighborhood. - You know... - The server farm on Dover Road. Of course. - Thanks for the tip. - Uh-uh. Ow! That's a pressure point. - Don't even go there, 'cause I will own you. - [cracking] - Ah. - Who's Sprague? Who's Maldark? And don't tell me they're exchange students. I'll explain on the way. Forget the town, all right? He can have it. This ain't my home anymore. At least according to my mom. I can't do this without you. You know that. You can't do it with me either. - That's a terrible attitude. - Who brought the N.P.C.? "N.P.C." What-- Is that, like, what, an insult? Insulted. Look, I did my part, and it didn't work out. Just go. You know, you're not just a knight in the game. I know I said that, but everything you've done since then has been selfless. I mean, think about it. You always put yourself right in the face of danger. You risked your own life to save mine with the troll, right? You even sacrificed yourself to save a guy you hate, then took the fall for it even though you knew it was gonna happen. You're not a screw-up, Dante. You're a bona fide knight. That being said, if I get hit with a Rectal Firecracker spell, I take it all back. You had me at "rectal firecracker." All right. I want to see 11 guarded jerseys on top of the ball carrier on this kickoff. I want you to knock the tar out of those guys and set the tone. - Lyle. - Show them what we're-- What the hell you doing in here? Just wanna show the guys support before the big game. - Right, Dante? - Yeah! Go, Spartans! - It's Trojans. - [Player] Yeah. Get out. We any good? Uh, they're with me, Coach. Uh, group project. All right. Listen up. I want you hustling back... What are you guys thinking? Max has been kidnapped by Sprague. Maldark's about to come out. Mass hysteria and mayhem are imminent. Too bad. I told you guys, man, I'm done. - I can't do this anymore. - And we can? Dude, this is much bigger than us. Like "end of the world" bigger. Like "frogs are raining from the sky" bigger, except these frogs are six feet tall, carry spears, and eat human hearts like candy, okay? [Coach] Hugginson, hustle up! Look, I can't help you. How many times do I have to say it? I'm done. You're not just a mage in the game. I know. And you probably think that... And it's the... - Rectal Firecracker? - Forget it. [sighs] I guess it's just the two of us. Wait. What? Oh, no. I'm in. Uh, hello. You're one body short. And I can handle myself. I've got three brothers and a black belt in Krav Maga. What? It's gonna take more than Jewish karate to put a hurt on these guys. Besides, you need a weapon from the game if you wanna come close to beating them. I'm sorry. - Maybe, uh, if she wore this. - Come on. Great idea. Why doesn't she just slap them to death? - What? It might work. - It's not gonna do it. How's that thing ever-- [Dante laughs] That's hot. - That'll work. - [clangs] - Aw! Damn! - Sorry. Hah. [quiet whistles] [beeps] [Wyatt] He's forcing Max to draw power from the server farm and build a mega portal for Maldark. Okay. Sneak in and rescue Max before he can finish building the portal. If Maldark gets out, things are gonna get ugly. - Yeah. - Let's do this. - [whistle blows] - [Players] Break! [Players shouting] 3, 7, hike! - [Players grunting] - [crowd cheering] [both] Tulta Munille! Battle cry? Really? [growling] Tall and ugly. - [yelling] - [clangs] - Ow! - Huh? [growling] [Cheerleaders] Trojans, fight, fight, fight! [whistle blows] - [growling continues] - [screams] Ow! [yells] [laughs] I killed it! [laughing] Or something. Nice. Nice. - Let's move. - All right. - **** [marching band] - [Cheerleaders whooping] Get your head in the game. Hey, don't sweat it. You're a closer, just like your dad. It's not that. - It's nothing. - [crowd cheering] Thank you all for coming out and supporting the team. Being that the second half looks like it's going to be a nail-biter, I don't wanna keep my son out here any longer than necessary. But he did wanna say a few things to you before he headed in. Lyle. - Yeah, I, uh... - [microphone feedback] I just wanted to let everyone know how much Daventry Hills means to me and the family. - And, um... - [whooshing] [electricity arcing] And that-- that's why... I gotta go. I mean, I'm sorry about the fumbles and the interception, but my head's just not in it today, and... You know what? Sometimes there's more important things in life than just football and popularity and campaign speeches-- Whoa. This isn't a campaign speech, son. - That would be unfair. - Like sticking by your friends, doing what's right, and being true to who you really are. And that means me telling all of you that I love geeking out to video games. - [laughter] - I always have. And even though it may not help me get ahead in life or make me cool, I'm proud of the fact that I have a level 68 Sorcerer in Conqueror of All Worls named Wizza, who casts some pretty awesome spells out of his Thunder Pole. [crickets chirping] [quiet murmuring] Okay, I just said that. I should probably go. So...thanks, and vote for my dad. - **** [marching band] - [murmuring] - [beeping] - [creature growls] Yeah, yeah. Got it. - [growls louder] - Okay. Zzzt. Agh! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Completely unnecessary, thank you. [roaring] [growling] [growls] This isn't good. [growling continues] Ow! - He replicated. - Let her go! Yeah. What he said, jerk. - [screams] - No! You don't know if you can get out. Angie's in trouble. [yells] Ohh! What-- What-- Oh, no. Oh, this is not good. Uh, I'm pixilated. Awesome. Wyatt, get me outta here! Angie? Oh, no! No! Wyatt, look out! - Yo! - Can't stop it! - [roars] - A level 65 Craven Snowman of the North. So not good. - [Angie] Oh, no! No! Duck! - [roars] [grunting] Whoa! What's up, el gordo? You ready to throw down or what? [laughs] Come on! Give me that horn! [yelling] Yeah! [grunts] [Angie] Wyatt! Please, please get me outta here! - [roaring] - Get me outta here! Do something! Wyatt! Wait! Look out! No retreat! Aah! - You did it! - Yeah! [sighs] Huzzah. Please, wait, wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Potty-breakus! [beeping] - [growls] - Agh! Hurry! Get me outta here before that-- that thing closes! Come on! Come on, Angie! - Go! Go! Go! Come on! - [grunting] - It's not working! - Go! Yeah. What happened to your team? Man, this is my team. Hey, where's Wyatt? Forget me. Just save yourself. - I'm not leaving without you. - I can't believe I'm in a video game. I don't even play video games. [yelling] [chuckles] You did it. - [clears throat] - Hey. It's nice to have you back. Hey, uh, nice to have you back. Let's level up and beat this final boss. - [beeps] - [growling] - Agh! - Max, shut it down! It's too late. I'm sorry. - [sinister laughter] - Don't touch me. [laughter continues] Ohhh! [roaring] [all yelling] [whimpering] Ah. A welcoming party? Splendid! But I bear no gifts. Oh. Yes, I do! [all yelling] - [beeping] - Are you nuts? It's due on Tuesday, okay? No. Wait. You're real? Touch me not! But I created you. [mocking with gibberish] I allowed you to create me, and what a disappointment you've shown yourself to be. To think I was going to make you my number one slave. Now you'll be lucky if I grant you the honor of being my number two footstool. Okay, you don't talk to me like that, all right? You're out of the sequel. - Silence! - [yelling] Ooh! If we can take down Maldark and put him back in the game, will you be able to rebuild the firewall? [scoffs] [laughs] - Maybe. - Make it happen. We need to trap him for good before he builds a portal for his army. - [Maldark laughing] - Max, let us know when the firewall's ready. - [laughing continues] - Tulta Munille. [Lyle, Dante] Tulta Munille. Liza Minnelli. Whatever. No. We got this. Just-- Just make sure to keep us in focus, all right? Okay. Careful. Now let's send this psycho wizard back to his game. On three, we throw everything we got at him. One, two, three. - Kilauea! - Wait! Wait, wait, wait. - What? - Back to the game. The game. In the game, we can only kill him with the ultimate weapon. - Max, how do we get it? - I told you, no free hints. - Max! - Dude! Fine! But if you tell anyone, I will sue you. Every player has a weapon in the game when they first join the game-- the weapon that becomes more powerful as their character does. Thunder Pole. - Blast-a-ton. - Skull Cracker. The clan needs to forge them in the fire of a mighty sorcerer to create an all-powerful weapon. Once they do, they get one shot and one shot only to destroy Maldark. - And if we miss? - [chuckles] Don't. Just a little side note, though. If you do succeed in hitting him, the concussion of the blast will most likely kill you. And when I say "most likely," I mean most definitely. - What? - That's how the game ends. You become rogue martyrs. It's poetic. No, that's not poetic. That's dark and weird, okay? Guys, there must be, like, another way. You don't have to do that, right? [Maldark continues laughing] - [whispering in foreign language] - [whirring] It was fun playing with you guys. Yeah. - NeverFail-- - [Lyle, Dante] NeverFail. [yells] Epic, right? You're welcome. How do we drive this thing? I don't think we do. [motor starts] [mechanical hum] [Maldark continues laughing] Yeah! - [typing] - Ready, Max? Just hold on a sec. Almost there. That's the stuff. [laughing] Subjugation is at hand! [laughing] - Uh, anytime now, Max. - Not yet. - We can't wait! - It's not ready! [Wyatt] We have to fire now! - [grunts] - [whirring] [laughing] **** [disco] What? - **** [continues] - Yeah. I like that. **** [speeding up] Really? Oh, no! - It's got him! - Yeah! [singsong voice] It's almost there. Noooo! [yelling] [all yelling] [beeps] Guys? Come on, guys. Guys, don't die. Wyatt. Wyatt! Don't you die, Wyatt! Don't you die! Ow! - Did you keep me in focus? - [chuckling] [groaning] You did it. You really did it. [groaning continues] You were supposed to die. You can't program people, Max. Yet. - Is he gone? - [Max] He's gone. And the firewall's back up. Epic win. [all laughing] Look, truth is, your son was helping me with some motion capture work on my latest project. I mean, in hindsight, perhaps destroying someone's car without their permission-- not the brightest of ideas. But once I explain everything to the vice principal and show him a bunch of shiny car catalogs, I'm sure he'll be a bit more understanding. You have to realize your son is one of the noblest knights-- - Kids. - Kids that I have ever seen. This town's lucky to have him looking after it. - I mean, living here. - I always felt he just needed to take ownership of his skill sets and channel his impulsivity. We all have our coping mechanisms. Well, uh, if you promise to stay out of trouble, and Mr. Ross can vouch for you, you can go back to strike two. Right. Well, uh, I should get going before the NSA triangulates my position. Uh, I would hug you all, but you know where I stand on that. So, uh, memory card, little lady. - What? - Yeah. No. No, no, no. No, no. I risked my life for this. Okay, I got trapped in a video game. That stuff gets out, and you know whose lives get ruined, right? [Wyatt, Lyle] It's rhetorical. Thank you, guys. Is the Quiz Bowl team still available? Yeah. If they let me back on. Mm... **** [rap] ** I hear the what * ** Talkin' like a rap star ** Drivin' in a fast car Look at that. - Oh, my... - What? ** Take a little heat * [Woman chuckling] Think we'll ever play the game again? You know, after living it? - Absolutely. - I'm in. Well, Tulta Munille, boys. Tulta Munille. Wow. [chuckles] So, uh, uh, text me about something sometime. O-Okay. - Oooh! - Oooh! What is going on over there? So you guys wanna go grab a bite at Deckard's? You mean, like, all of us together? Might ruin your rep. My rep's already ruined, guys. Welcome to my life. - Come on. - Shotgun! Things have returned to normal here in Daventry Hills as the strange disturbances of the past few weeks have subsided almost as quickly and mysteriously as they arrived. Local authorities continue to deny any correlation between the recent blackout and the odd events. The cause of the unexplained phenomena that wracked this town remains just that-- unexplained. Reporting from a peaceful Main Street, I'm Tex Thatcher. [sinister laughter] [sinister laughter continues] Closed-Captioned By J.R. Media Services, Inc. Burbank, CA
