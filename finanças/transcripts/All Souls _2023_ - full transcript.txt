- Mama. - What, what is it, baby? - There are monsters. - It's okay, baby, shh, shh. - Drop the bag! On your knees right now! Don't fucking move. - We got you on attempt to distribute. You know what that means, Carcillo? It means little Jade and her mommy aren't gonna see each other for a long time. Get us to Silas. - You know, we were trying to do you a favor. It's easy enough. File the charges and we'll let you figure out bail, lawyer, Child Protective Services. - I don't know him! - Yeah, okay. How many times we gotta do this? Do you wanna keep your daughter? - Vroom. Mama, come play with me. - Who do I get to be? - I'm this car. - Okay. - That's my person. This is the one that's messy. - Yeah, what up, bro? Yo, I like your face. - I like your face. - I mean, just my face? - Leave her the fuck alone, Stevie. - Yo, watch your language. There's a fucking kid here, man. - It's okay, I know fuck word. - Yeah, that's my fault, right? - Yep, we're gonna go down. Are there real good people at the parade? - Yep, come on. - Damn, you look just like the Bony Lady. You laugh, but it's true. She protects us, and she'd do the same for you. - We're doing all right for real. - Bye, Jade. - Bye. - Ay, yo, come hang tonight. I'll take care of you. Anything of you need, you know what I'm saying? - Yeah, but she's the only one who can handle me. - But she's expensive, though. - Damn right, I am, bye, honey. - Bye. - What's that? - Some moss. - Ew. - I want to see them. - Me too. - You can't catch me! Hi! - Hi. What you got there? - Nana. - Oh, I know Nana. - No, you don't, she's dead. - But that's why we're here, right? - Oh, what's good girl? - Hey, yo! - Hey, we're gonna be right back. You ready, ready, ready? Let's go. - Are you doing okay? - Fine. - Your mom, she was- - Thanks for taking Jade tonight. - Yeah, I love hanging out with her. Do I need to worry about you? - Shut up, you know I'm good. I always am, fucking cockroach. Gotta go to work, boo. I love you. - I love too. - Have fun, okay? Hey Jade, stay dangerous. - Stay dangerous, mama. - Pack of rettes. - You old enough? - Yeah. - $11,62. They say those things will kill you, but you look dead already. - Can I get the bathroom key? - Don't make a mess. - Take your fucking time. You're late. - Yeah, and you're fucking ugly. What are we gonna do about it? - 1508 south. - Of all the nights, the fuck's wrong with you? - Hey, can you two cool it? Try to keep your head on straight, this is really serious. - Yeah, I know. I'm the one going out there. - Gimme your backpack. - Yes, sir. - 10Gs. - Nothing suss about that at all. - No more fucking around with the small stuff. - So big. - Yeah, you're gonna be all right, okay? We're gonna be with you the whole time. - Well, actually, not at all because I'm walking out there alone. Can I have my fucking backpack please? - You know what I mean, we're gonna be able to hear everything. - '83 Toyota, 193 red on 95th Street. - This is it, right? You wanted me to get you Silas? I got you Silas. - Not yet, you didn't. - I'm about to, so. - So when you get him, you're done. - All right, what's the code? - I know the fucking code. - Just say it. - Pleasure doing business, Silas. - Perfect. - Can I get some cash? - For what? - I bought cigs and a drink. - Oh yeah, you got a receipt? - Fuck you. - Yeah, get out of the car. - Yeah, fuck you two! - Okay, goodnight. - Fucking pig! - Always with the singing. - Whatever works. - Get in. - Where's Silas? - Who the fuck is Silas? - Frankie. - Change of plans, Riv, get in. - Come on man, you know I gotta get home to my kid. - You stay at the Oasis, right, right? - Yeah. - Get in the car. Hold up, arms out. - Really? - Yo, hey, yo, let's go. She's golden, come on. - I'm golden. - Let's go. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Did she just get in the fucking car? - Go, go! - Is she there, is she there? She's not fucking there. - Gimme your phone. - I'm sorry, the person you were trying- - Fuck! - to reach has a voicemail box that has not been set up yet. - How the fuck do we find them now? - I don't know! - How much longer until we get there, man. Gotta get back home. - Sit back and shut up. - Frankie, a dirt road? Where are we going, man? - Jesus Christ, relax. What's up, Jack? - Gentlemen. - Come on. - Fuck! - What are you doing? Come on, let's go, get out. Go ahead, go. - Hey, I gotta piss. Fuck! If you guys, can still hear me, I'm at a ranch up a dirt road, off of Sierra, 11-7-55 Spade. Just fucking hurry up and get here! - How long are we gonna wait here? - I gotta think, man. - What we gotta do is call this in now. - So you wanna tell our boss we lost a CI? Then what? - Then they send back up and we find River before something fucked up happens. - We are this close to nailing Silas Butler. - Are we? Where is he, huh? Where's the 10Gs? Where's our fucking CI? - Do I need to remind you what this would mean for us, do I? And you wanna blow it over some throwaway that's not even in the system. - We gotta fucking find her, okay? - Yo, why the water been running so long? - Maybe she's nervous. - You got a piss fetish or something? - What? Nah, man, I was, come on, go. - Have a seat, darling. Look at you, a lot different than last time I saw you. Your hair, your clothes. Now you got this whole, is it a chick, is it a dude kind of vibe going on. I dig it. - Thanks. - I'm not sure if what happened back then, will happen today if... But, who knows? - Yeah, yeah, I'm not sure what happened last time would've happened, if I wasn't drunk as fuck and 16, but yeah, it did, so. - You could always talk shit, that's why I liked you, River. You still like candy? Come on, help yourself. - Okay, so I got 10Gs. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, pump the brakes. What's the rush? I haven't seen you in years. Relax. - Yeah, yeah, right. I'd love to stay and party. I gotta get back home. - Yes, ah, right, our daughter, of course. How is she by the way? - My daughter's fine. - Gosh, she's gotta be what like, what, three by now? - She's five. - Yikes. - Yeah, I mean, I didn't really come here to talk about her. - No, I think you did. You got to my man. You made sure he knew who you were. I mean, River, do you really think you'd be sitting here otherwise? Come on,. Excuse me, oh, fuck. What? - Just that I gotta get home. - Come on, we get to spend some time and catch up. We can do some magnificent cocaine in my big ass house. - Yeah, yeah and that coke is legit. - I know, here, it's on me. Take one for the road. - Always a gentleman, Silas. - I would like to think so. So tell me, what the fuck are you doing here? - I mean, I- - Uh-uh, they told me everything. I need to hear it from you. - I take classes at Valley, and I mean, those dudes are always looking to score, so I figure I might as well be the one selling to 'em. - So let me get this straight. You saved up 10 bands slinging shit to those chuckle heads over there at Valley? - Yeah, I'm fucking good. - So what do you need me for? - Do you know how long it took me to do that? Just selling like loose pills and a gram here and there? And then I figured you owed me one, so. - I owed you one? - Well, how much has my kid cost you? How many birthday parties have you thrown? Yeah, well, wait, what about diapers? - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Did you buy any? - No, no, no, that's what you wanted, that's what you got. - No, I did, but- - Yeah. - But don't tell me you didn't appreciate it. - Oh, you're tripping. You are a hustler. - No, I'm just trying to keep my head down and take care of my girl. - I respect that. Fuck it, let's get you laced up. - All right. - You ever slay Molly? - No. - Those kids at Valley will eat it up. It's a lot though. You think you can handle that? - Yeah, I'm sure, I'm sure. - Because you see, if you give me that money, you understand from that point forward, you and I are bonded. And if you don't bring me back my cut, it won't matter who the fuck you are. You understand what I'm saying? - Yeah, I know, I know. I got it. My drink must've spilled. - What the fuck? Shit right there, It'll kill you, baby. - My bad. - Frankie, come here. Come dry this off before it fucks up something else. - Pleasure doing business, Silas. - Yeah. - Wait. - Yeah? - Stay a while. Come on. Come on. - Yo, what the fuck? Ay, Si, there's some motherfucking wire in this bag. - Fuck, go! - I got her, fucking bitch! Open the door! - Hey, she's in the courtyard! - Get her, get her! Get her! - Fucking jump I... - I got the car! - Get her, fuck! Fuck! Goddam, you fucked up, Frankie! - Get in. - Si's gonna fucking kill us, man! - Get in, we gotta handle this. - She's golden, huh? - Shut the fuck up. - Open the door, bro, come on. - Fucking A. - Fuck, man! - What's up, Switch? - Guys, what are you doing here? - Oh, shut up! - You're trying to get me killed. What do you mean shut up in my home? - I just wanna talk to you. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, y'all are on some shit tonight? - Where's Silas' spot? - Fuck if I know. - You better figure it out in the next 30 seconds. - How am I supposed to figure out something I don't know? - We've been pretty fair to you over the years, haven't we Switch? - Oh, come the fuck on, man. Y'all taking advantage of me ever since the moment you busted me. - And how many of those days have you spent locked up? - Look, that's not the point. The point is y'all can't just be coming up in here, treat me like some fucking ATM machine every time y'all want. - That's exactly where you are until we say different. - Okay, Carcillo, what you gonna do? You gonna arrest me, for what? Who put y'all on River in the first place, huh? - Y'all wouldn't have without me. Hey, hey, whoa, whoa. - Start talking. - Okay, all right, look, I don't know where he is, but I got a guy in mind. - I swear to God, if you're bullshitting us, let's go. - Well, hey, whoa, my laundry gonna get wrinkled, goddammit. Man, I had a girl come over tonight too. - Stacy, I need help. - Hey, what's going on? - Meet me out back? I need help, meet me out back, okay? Please. - Yeah, okay. - Where is he, Switch? - He works up in there. - Where? - At the house, with the beanie. - That him? - Yeah, there he is right there. - What the fuck? - Yo, where does Silas live? - Shit! - No, no, no. - Don't move, don't move, hey, hey! Step the fuck back! - Where does Silas live? - Fuck you! - Fuck me, yeah? Where does Silas live? - I need your phone, your car, and I need you to not ask me any questions. - Why? - No questions please. I'll owe you big time. I'll cover your shifts. Anything you want. - It's always something with you. - Come on, just gimme your phone. - I can't, how am I supposed to get home? - Just let me borrow it. - Fine! - What's the matter Freddie Cat? This is only a tiny little bird. - You mean a poor little, pinky, winky, intsy-wintsy, itsy-bitsy... - I'm a bad pussycat. - Hello? - Thank God. - River? - Is Jade okay? - Yeah, of course. She's passed out next to me. What's up? - Okay, don't open the door for anyone. I'll be there soon. - River, what's going on? - Just don't open the door. I'm on my way. - Valley PD. - I need to speak to Detective Carcillo or Hernandez, please. - One moment. - You've reached the desk of Carcillo. - Fuck! - Leave a message, I'll get back to you. - Carcillo, it's River. I escaped from Silas'. It's a compound up a dirt road off of Sierra. The address is 11-7-5-5 Spade. I'm headed back to my apartment, so meet me there if you get this. I need help. What? Gimme the keys. Come on! - Seriously, don't fuck up my car, okay? - It's a fucking piece of shit, Stacy. It'll be fine. - White, possibly 16 to 21 years, wearing dark clothing. Weapon used was a five to six inch. - Get out. - Not even near my house. - You didn't give us shit. Get the fuck out. - In a Chevrolet. - Get the fuck out! - Y'all out of your fucking minds! Fuck you! Fuck! - Jade, Mads? Jade, baby? - Oh my God, Mads! Are you okay? Can you hear me? Where's Jade? - River, who were those guys? Hello? - Put River on the phone. - Where's my daughter? - You fucking snitch! - Where is she? - You wanna see her again? Then you're gonna do exactly what I say. Be at Silas' in 30 minutes or it's nap time for Jade. - Don't fucking touch her. - It's up to you. - What the fuck, River? Hey, who are these guys? Who are these guys? Are you doing drug deals with Silas now? What's wrong with you? - It's not like that. I got set up. - Hi there, I'm Silas. What's your name? - Jade. - Nice to meet you, Jade. - I got a plan. - I dunno. - You gotta think she can't use her phone, otherwise she would've called. - Yeah. - I want my mom. - How about your dad? - He's an asshole. - Yeah, I heard that too. - You can't go back there, Alone, you can't. - I have to. - What's gonna happen? You and Jade are coming home. That's it, okay. I love you. - I love you too. - What about the station? She can call there, right? - How about a soda, yeah? - Thank you. - You have very nice manners, Jade. - Carcillo, it's River. I escaped from Silas'. It's a compound up a dirt road off of Sierra. The address is 11-7-5-5 Spade. I'm headed back to my apartment, so meet me there. - Her apartment, go! - I need help! Hey, I need to talk to Stevie. - Okay, come in. - Look who it is. Oh, you came back. Yeah, man, enough with that. - Yeah, I thought I couldn't handle you. - Stevie, I'm serious. I need some help. - What you need, Riv? - I need a piece. - A piece? - Yeah man, I need a weapon. - Yo, you got a piece? - I don't think she'd want mine. - Yo, you think I just got those laying around, ready to hand out? - I don't know, I just thought. - Yo Riv, what kind of trouble are you in? - Can you help me or not? - I'm sorry, River I'm high as fuck right now. - Listen, it's clean. - Thank you. - Thank her... Santa Muerte, the patron saint for those of us living on the outside like me, like you. She brought you here, and whatever you're facing, she'll protect you from it. Come here. My dearest and most Holy Santa Muerte, my beloved Black lady, I invoke that aid and protection for our sister. My queen, my mother, I pray that you grant her protection day and night without fail. Holy mother of shadows, protect her from all her hidden enemies and reveal to her those that are false and have only bad intentions for her. And break down every obstacle that stands in the path of her happiness. Uplift her spirit and refill her with thy love, for you are our mother, amen. - I hope I see you soon. - Fuck! - You fucked up my man. - Yeah, well, he did step in front of a moving car, so. - Don't get cute. - Facts is facts, man. - What's up with that doll? - It's for my girl. She's attached to it. - Spread your arms. Spread your legs. - Most action you've got in a while? - You're not funny, bitch. - Can I go in? - Yeah. Downstairs, snitch. - Mama! - It's okay, baby. It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, okay. - Have a seat, River. I was just spending some quality time with Jade. Cute little thing. I think I'm gonna start seeing her. - Yeah, we can schedule hangouts and visits whenever you want, man. - How do you like that? Yeah, yeah? Get her outta here. - No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait, just let her have this. - No. - Mama! - Riv, sit down. - What the fuck is wrong with you? - Come on, sit down. - Mom, no! - Sit the fuck down. River, sit down. - Stay, stay. - Fuck you. - Lemme out, mama, mama! - What, are you just gonna let her fucking cry? - Shut the fuck up! So you wanna talk? - Yeah, let's fucking talk. - Don't be a cunt. I heard the mother of my child needed help. And yeah, I liked that you didn't come to me with your hands out. I respected that you wanted to work. So I said fuck it. You never asked me for nothing besides to leave you and the kid alone. And did I do that? Did I do that? - Yeah, you did. - That's right, because I respect you. And what do I get in return for that respect? You wore a wire into my fucking home. - Si, I did. - Shut the fuck up! - You know, your fucking drink's probably the only reason we're not in jail right now. - I'm sorry. I got mad. I'm really sorry, man. They targeted me, and I didn't have another choice. - You always have a choice. You shut the fuck up and you take the medicine. - Think about what's in that room 'cause it's not just about me. And then those cops, they jammed me apart. And you were the only thing they wanted. It was my little girl or work for them. And what was I supposed to do? - Yeah, it's a pretty tough spot to be in. What do y'all think? What should she have done? - Shut the fuck up. - Take her medicine. - Si, come on. They don't know that a deal happened. - What do they know about me? - Nothing, not where you live. They don't know who your dealers are. They don't know shit. And the wire's dead because otherwise they would've been here a few hours ago. We can make this right. We can all go home. No one in jail, and no one dead. - Wouldn't that be nice? - Yeah, just let us go home. It's been a long night. We're all gassed, man. - You tried to fuck me River. And I get it, I once fucked you too. So what, you're trying to get me back now? - No, no, it's not like that. I swear, I swear on Jade's life. - The fuck is that supposed to mean to me? - You gotta believe me, man. - I believe you, I do. It just doesn't fucking matter because I can't let a snitch go. It's bad for business. I'm sorry, Riv. - No, step the fuck back. Stay there, no closing and drop your fucking gun! - Take it easy. - Put it on the floor. Stay there, kick it, kick it. - Hey, calm down! - Let my fucking daughter go! - I can't do that, Riv. - Let her go. Si, I'm not fucking around! - Riv, Riv, put the gun- Whoa, no! - Open the door and let us go Si! - Vic. Take it easy. - Mama, no! Let her go! Let her go! - Come here, come here. - Let her go! - Everybody just take a breath. Jesus Christ! - Let her go! - Calm down, calm down! - Don't you worry about her, she'll be fine. - Fuck you, you fucking piece of shit! Let me the fuck go! - You know what, Vic, hold up. - Fuck you! - Shut the fuck up! - She's fucking struggling. - Take her to the back stairs. - Fuck it, man. - Hold it tight. - Yo, yo, yo, where are you going? - Gotta go check the door. - My leg, man. I'm gonna fucking bleed out. - It's a flesh wound, man. You'll be fine. - Yo, watch her. - Valley PD, you're gonna wanna put that down slowly. - Hey, time to wake up. Come on. Stay still. Things could have been a lot different, River. - Hands on your fucking head. - Hey, hey, sit down! - Open your eyes. Open 'em up. That's it, baby, that's it. - What the fuck did you do? - Fuck! Come on, come on, come on. Let's get out of here, come on. Drop her, drop her, drop her, man. Leave this bitch. Let's get the fuck out of here. - Hey, hey, hey, sit down. - Enough. I think it's time we call this in. - Vic! - Shit! Yo, where's everybody? - We heard shots, and they went upstairs. - Where's the girl? - She bounced, man! - You couldn't stop a little girl from leaving? - Just look at my fucking leg. - You let a rat in here and you can't do your fucking job. - This is Detective Carcillo requesting backup on 11-7-5-5 Spade Road. Shots have been fired, and an officer's been hit. - Si? Vic? - Don't say a fucking word! - Mama! - Go, go! - What about Frankie? - Fuck Frankie! - No, I gotta go get him. - Fuck! - Ah, ah, shh, daddy's got you. - Come on, okay. Come on, get the door, get the door. - Here, take the girl. - Si, we ain't got time, man. We gotta go. We gotta fucking go man, come on! - River! - Thank you for her. - Mom! - Drop my daughter, Vic! Put her down now! I said, put her fucking down! - River, put the gun down! - Stay the fuck outta this, Carcillo! Now! He's dead! - Riv, come on, don't do anything fucking stupid. - They took my fucking daughter! - I know, you got her back. It's over, let us handle this. - I'm done being your fucking pawn. - That's fine, just put the gun down. - Say it. - You're done, River. - Turn around, get on your knees! Turn around, hands on your head now! Down, don't you fucking move! - Oh, baby. - Chill! - You fucking chill. - Don't you fucking move. - River! - My fucking leg, man. - Shut up! - I don't give a shit about your fucking leg. - Yo, fucking chill! - Fuck, man! - We stayed dangerous. - Yeah, you're fucking right we did. Drink some more, baby. - Is that all you got?
