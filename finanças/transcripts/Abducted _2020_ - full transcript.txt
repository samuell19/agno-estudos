(gentle music) (soldier speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) I got something to tell you, Smith, something I never thought I'd hear myself say to you. - Just spill it. Save these two privates the headache. (both laughing) - I want you to be her godfather. - Oh, damn. - Congratulations, sir. - Thank you. - That's some news. Congrats to you too, sir. - Hey, Uncle Smith. (laughing) - Uncle Smitty, fits you, man. - I didn't see this coming. - I know, I got you. - [Smith] Congratulations, my brother, mwah. - All right, all right, all right. (Smith laughing) - She's beautiful. Looks just like her mother. We're going viral on the web with this one. - Ah, bullshit. - Don't underestimate Uncle Smith. Yeah. Mwah. - [Private] Ready? Here we go, all right, one, two. (explosion rumbling) (dramatic music) (guns firing) (men shouting) (speech drowned out by music) (private screaming) - Go! (soldier shouting in foreign language) (speech drowned out by music) (explosion hissing) Get down! Get down! (somber music) - You gonna learn, you gonna make money, you gonna make a living, but the problem is, you're gonna be away, so you have to deal with it. I've been on the road New Year's Eve seven years in a row. Sometimes I didn't remember what the hell was going on on the first. (laughing) - Oh, was it? - Okay. Go ahead and hit the button. - Hey, sweetie, how's it going? - Hi, Dad. Uncle Todd and I are here with Mom. - Another year, sis. Eden's seven years old now. - We were in the garden today, Dad. Still feels weird without Mom here. - Yeah, I know baby. But she's looking over us every day, okay? Remember what I told you, right? You can call me here anytime. It doesn't matter what time it is. - When are you coming back? - Soon, yeah, really soon. Just gotta finish some work here and I'll be back before you know it. And when I get back, we're getting a big place. - Can we get a dog? (Dane chuckling) (Todd laughing) - Sure, why not? - Promise? - I promise. - Uncle Ross is here. Going to go say hi. - Let me talk to your dad. - Love you. - Love you too, Dad. - Go. She's cute. - And growing up way too fast. Just wish Zoe was here to see it all. I appreciate you, Todd. After this contract gig, I'll be in a much better place. - There's really no reason for you to do this trucking. - But I really think this is a good thing for me. I'll soon be in a place where I can support her, pay you and Ross back for everything you guys have done. Catching up. - We're just helping our family. - Well, looks like I gotta go hit the road, so tell Ross I said hi. Have fun at the party tonight. - Thank you. Be careful out there. (jazzy music) (women laughing) (people chattering) - [All] One! (all cheering) - Happy new year. - Eden, come on. Put this away, it's New Year's. - Happy new year. - Yeah! It's New Year's. - How often do you get to stay up this late, huh? - [Ross] I know, we're the coolest uncles ever. - [Todd and Ross] Mwah. - [Todd] Happy new year. - [Ross] Happy new-- - Aren't you guys supposed to be kissing? - [Both] Oh. - All right. - Smart kid, that one. - Yes, she is. - [Todd and Ross] Mwah. - There you go. Go play with real people. - I'm gonna hold on to this, okay? (chuckling) (suspenseful music) - Hi. - Happy new year. - Happy new year. - I didn't know you were here. - I Just got here. You're almost as tall as me. - No, I'm not. - You like snails, don't you? (gasps) There you go. See, we got the matching ones. Shh, let's keep this between you and I. Shh, okay? - Hey, hey. Hey, Eden, would you do me a huge favor here? Hey, wait, hold on. Will you do me a favor and go into the kitchen there and play with those kids? I need to talk to Smith for a second. - Yeah. - Yeah? Is that okay? - See you later. - You don't have to get gifts like that for her every time you see her. I mean, have you looked at yourself lately, Smith? - What's that supposed to mean? - You're not leaving anytime soon, right? - I was just talking to my goddaughter. The hell you're coming up to me like that? - Yeah, but she's my niece and this is my house, so I suggest you leave. - Hey, hey, hey, what the heck is going on here, guys? - Nothing, nothing. Smith was just leaving. Ain't that right? - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - No, no, no, no, don't stop him. I mean, have you smelled the alcohol on him? - Wait, wait. What happened in there? - Nothing. - Don't go. - Your husband doesn't want this guy in his house, so I'm out. - [Todd] Wait, please. - Thanks for hospitality. Happy fucking new year. (Todd sighing) - Hello, can I come in? - Yes. - [Todd] What are you doing? (Eden mumbling) - You can make him like a big giant. - [Todd] Oh, my goodness. That's a lot of candy. (dramatic music) (knocking on door) - Oh, my god. - Gross, candy and candy? (Eden chuckling) (Todd laughing) - What kind of candy? - I don't know. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. (Eden screaming) (thunder rumbling) - [Shirley] Here's your check, Detective. - Thanks. See you tomorrow, Shirley. - [Dispatcher] We have a 10-7-1 at 11905 Vista. Additional units. - Unit 0619 here. - Go ahead, Fini. Take that one. - Block off all streets in a one-mile radius. No cars in or out. I'm in route. (siren wailing) (dramatic music) - [Walter] Did you speak to the captain? - Yeah. - Masked man, beatings, blood. It's a fucking mess, come on. - [Fini] Get off of there. (camera shutter clicking) - This is Detective Fini. - Tanke. Okay, follow me up the stairs here. Watch your step. Owners' names are Todd and Ross Meisner, gay couple. Both were here during the invasion, including their niece, Eden. She's missing. It's looking like the invader came in through her bedroom downstairs. Then they came in here. - They've taken the couple over to Saint Joseph's around 15 minutes ago. One of them is in critical condition. That's all we know for now. - Do we have any units over there? - Uh, two. - We should get their statements ASAP. - I think Officer Enriquez is getting the statements from the neighbors. I'll have him go over right after. - Detective, you should come see this. (thunder rumbling) We were lucky to catch this before the rain started. We traced the blood from the house out here. It goes all the way down there. (thunder rumbling) (dispatcher chattering) - We've a possible suspect fleeing on foot. He's been on the run for about 30 minutes. I need a hard target search started immediately. That means all residences, rest stops, gas stations. Don't leave anything out. Suspect might have also abducted a seven-year-old girl, brunette, approach with caution. - What'd you find out? - We need to get that girl's photo out there. Checkpoints up to 20 miles. We need to contact her parents. - [Scott] Hey, you done in here? - Yeah, just a few more things and we'll be good for the night. How you doing? - Oh, truck's empty. Ready to go, man. - Dane. Your boss man's been trying to get a hold of you, man. Some kind of emergency with your brother-in-law, says you need to head home right now. Call him on the way. What's up, Scott? I can take you to the airport right now if you want. - I got this, go. - Okay. - Go. (monitor beeping) - [Fini] No one comes in or out of this room except for staff. And keep that 24-hour watch on him. He's conscious, I need to be the first to know. - Stay put. - Feeling better, Mr. Meisner? - Todd, please. Can you tell the nurse to come unplug me from this? I need to see Ross. - I don't think that's a good idea. He's safe in the other room. You should rest right now. I also have a few questions for you while all of this is still fresh to you. - I gave my statement to the other officer. (clears throat) So is someone looking for my niece? - We are. Did the invader make any sort of demands? - We didn't exactly have a conversation. It was very quick. He held us at gunpoint. He grabbed her. - Mr. Meisner, is there anyone that you could think of that would want to do harm to your family? - No. No, I mean, no one that I know of. - Any enemies, recent confrontations with anyone? - Most the people we know are family or friends from Ross's work. We don't know the kind of monster that-- - Sir, sir, you can't go in there, sir. - [Walter] It's fine. - What happened? Where's Eden? - Detective Fini. I'm leading the investigation. - Investigation? Ross is in a coma down the hall. What the hell happened? - Someone came in the house. - Mr. Hunte, there was a home invasion. Your brother-in-law was attacked, and your daughter, she's currently missing. - Who, do you know? - No, I don't know. - Did you check the house? She's a smart girl. She's probably hiding somewhere, maybe at the neighbors'. - She's not in the house or at the neighbors'. - You sure? You're telling me no one saw her? I'll go check the house myself. - We think the perpetrator might have taken her. - This happened last night. And you believe she was kidnapped? My daughter is missing, Detective. What is it you're doing exactly to bring her back home? - We have a few leads, and we have a search party out there looking for your daughter, sir. We released an AMBER alert, and we have plenty of checkpoints out in that area. We're doing everything that we can. Please let me do my job. Thank you for your cooperation, Mr. Meisner. I'll be in touch. (suspenseful music) (Smith groaning) - They said I could get back in later tonight but I don't see how I could ever stay there again. - Hey, brother. I'm so sorry about what happened. You too, Todd. - Thanks - You guys remember Harry? - Hey, sorry to hear about everything. - We got about 19 guys. Some of them even saw your posts on social media this morning and they wanted to help. You heard from Smith yet? - No. - This is the latest photograph of her. - [Fred] Hand these out. Make sure everyone gets one. - Got it. - All right, we have the east and west sides covered. If you guys want to join us and do the north and south sides, that would be best. Let me know if you need any help getting word out to the press. - Yeah, I've already contacted a few outlets. - Thanks for making this happen. - Oh, don't mention it. It's no different than if it was my own daughter. It's gonna be a long night, bro, but if she's out here, we'll find her. You gotta have some hope and take it one step at a time. - I'll take the south. (dramatic music) - So you were home last night? Take any medication? - Yeah, some, yeah. I've done some pretty fucked up things before, but messing with kids? No, I mean, that's something I would never do. - Who said anything about kids? - I, uh, (clears throat) I watch the news and your mug is all over it, all right. Now, if you'll excuse me, I really need to finish. Pretty sure you need a warrant for that. - Two years as a narc and already a detective. The department must have ran out of pussy. - What the fuck is this, Casper? - My new hobby. - So what do you know about the home invasion last night? Didn't hear anything from your road dogs? - I'm clean. I don't fuck around no more. And if I knew anything, I'd tell you. So don't come to my job, okay? That's it. - Can I help you? - I have a few questions about an associate that works here. Perhaps I can speak to Mr. Lewis, Mr. Ives? - Mr. Lewis doesn't operate out of this office. - Where does he operate out of then? - I'm afraid I don't know. They don't tell me that kind of information. - What about Mr. Ives? Is he available? - [Receptionist] No, he passed away years ago. - Who do you suggest helps me then? - One moment, please. Understood, thank you. I'm sorry, there's no one that can help you right now. - Maybe you can help me. Ross Meisner, he's an associate that works here. You heard or seen anything out of the ordinary lately with him? Any strange visitors or anything? - Other than you? No. Is there anything else I can help you with? - No, that'll be it. Have a good day. Fucking lawyers. (Todd sighing) (Dane sighing) - You sure you wanna stay in here? - Yeah. - All right. I'll be at the hospital if you need anything. Try and get some rest. (gentle music) (Dane screaming) (phone ringing) - Yeah. - Came across him about 20 minutes ago. One of them had a confrontation with one of the customers in the bar last night. - [Prostitute] Welcome back, handsome. - Need you to tell her what you told me. - There ain't much to tell, baby. That little girl that went missing, we know who did it. - Mm-hmm. - And who would that be? - A pervert that was sitting at the bar tried to rub up on me in the alley, and then asked me if I knew any youngins that he could fuck with. - I saw that sick fuck going down the street up to those rich folks' houses. I mean, we ain't no detective, but that's-- - What happened to your hand? - Listen, he's a cradle robbing pervert, okay? Y'all need to find him and lock his ass in the cooler. - Do you have a description? - Yeah, African American male, possibly 30s, black jacket. - (sighs) See if anyone else around here can verify their story. You the owner? - Yeah, 22 years. You gonna get those bimbos outta here? All that bustle is hurting my business. - Apparently, they got into a confrontation last night with one of your customers, young, black, male. See what happened? - I would hardly call that a confrontation. All the guy did was give them his drinks. Truth of which by the way he didn't even pay for. - So you know him? - Yeah, I know him, but I ain't no snitch. Look, I don't wanna get the guy jammed up with the law. - Withholding information-- - Take it easy. The guy's name is Smith. The poor bastard's deaf. He's been in here every night drinking himself to death and running up quite a tab. That's why he's banned from here forever. - So you didn't see anything that happened in the alleyway? - No, that I did not. - Thank you. (somber music) - (scoffs) That ain't gonna work, honey. No one pays the bills around here. He owes me six months' rent. I had to give him an eviction notice even though I hated to do that to someone who served this country. We got three more open units out back. I would hate to throw all of his stuff out, but we did start cleaning up a bit. He's gonna be shocked when he gets back, if he gets back. - Have you even seen anyone come around? Any relatives, any friends? - No. I never really thought that he had any family or friends. He's a real loner. (dramatic music) - Stop! (upbeat music) Move, move, move! (gun firing) (people screaming) I know you can't hear me. (dramatic music) - I, I. - Can you read my lips? - I didn't do it. - Keep your hands up, don't move. (Fini grunting) Hey! (Fini panting) How's the arm? - My arm is better than my legs. How's your face? - Don't let me interrupt. - Go on. - So, I left the bar. - Hey, get off me, cradle-robbing pervert. Shit! - [Smith] But these bitches followed me outside. - There he is, that sick fuck. - Hey, retard. Where you going, huh? You wanna explain what the hell you were doing with my girl, huh? (Pimp grunting) - [Prostitute] You okay? (Prostitute yelping) (Smith screaming) (Prostitute groaning) - [Smith] I had no choice. I was just defending myself. - Is that when you went to the Meisners' residence? - I didn't know where else to go for help. Other than Dane, Todd has always been someone I could trust. - (sighing) What the hell are you doing here? - Is Todd here? - [Ross] He is. - Can I speak to him, please? I could use his help. - Are you joking? - Look, (clears throat) I don't want any trouble. - I'll go get him. - I'm not buying it. - Running was not a wise decision. - I've had my fair share of trouble with the law, but didn't need to stick around and get that third strike. Now, if that motherfucker didn't call the cop, I wouldn't-- - Well, he didn't. He's in a coma right now. What do you know about the home invasion? Did you take the girl? - So what you're telling us is that you weren't aware of the home invasion and kidnapping when it was in progress at the Meisners'? - We matched your blood to the blood at the house. We have a search party at your apartment. You might as well start coming clean. - What'd you say? - Your friend's daughter, she's missing. You wouldn't happen to know where she is, would you? - Oh, I get it. I see what's happening here. Good cop and bad cop bullshit. How dare you? How fucking dare you asking me that? Get a lawyer in here! - On the night of the crime, did you happen to see or speak to Mr. Whitaker? - Why would that matter? - Because the blood we found at your place is the same type as Mr. Whitaker's. We're still testing to see if it's an exact match, but I think it will be. Mr. Hunte, please have a seat. - I'm good. You got someone? - Mr. Smith Whitaker was brought in for questioning. I understand he's a friend of yours. - Yeah, he's my daughter's godfather. - I'm aware of that. That's why I wanted to tell you personally before the news breaks out. - Did you talk to Smith? Does he know anything about Eden's whereabouts? - We're still trying to figure that out. Unfortunately, at this moment, I cannot give you any more information. - Mr. Meisner, are there any recent events that you can think of that would cause Smith to harm you or your family? - Smith and Ross had a minor argument on New Year's Eve. He was drunk. It was nothing. Smith is family. - I read somewhere that half the kids gone missing like this aren't found alive. Is that true? - There's certainly lots of statistics out there that would indicate so, but-- - And if the kidnapper isn't found by day one, chances of solving go down to about 10%. - I assure you that Detective Fini here and our team is working around the clock to find your daughter. - Doing what? Investigating my innocent best friend while my while my daughter's still out there waiting for her father to bring her back home? - We're gonna find Eden. - 36 hours and counting. (door slams shut) (dramatic music) - Oorah, brother. Damn, it's good to see you. - Yeah, same to you. - Hanging on? - Yeah. - Everything you asked for right here. It's all clean too. What do you plan to do with all these? - You can never be too careful. - Hey, I have my guys put word on the street about your daughter. If I hear anything, I'll keep you posted, all right? - Thanks for looking out, Jay. (keyboard clicking) (laptop beeping) - Oh, fuck. Are you fucking kidding me? (sighing) Bullshit. (dramatic music) Fuck. Don't you come any closer. You hear me? I'll fucking shank you. Stay back. The fuck are you? Come here, come here! Oh, fuck, fuck! What do you want, man, what do you want? - Where is she? - I don't know who she is, man. I don't mess with any kids. I already told you guys. - Told who? - What, you ain't a cop? Those aren't mine, man. I don't know where those came from. - What is this for? - I don't fucking know. - Tell me where she is. - I don't know. - Then you'll fucking die tonight, you worthless junkie! - I don't know what else to tell you, if I did, I don't know shit. Please, man, please - That's unfortunate. - No, ah, fuck! (crying) - Hey, you see this? Huh? - Okay, okay, okay, okay! I'll tell you. I'll tell you, put the knife down. Put the knife down. Please, god, just stop, stop, stop! I'll tell you where she is! I'll tell you where she is, please! - [Dane] The next one won't be your finger. - I'll tell you, man. Please, please, put it down. - The girl. - I'll tell you. I'll tell you, put the knife down. Okay, stop, stop, stop! Please, I'll tell you! I'll fucking take you right now! I'll fucking take you, bro, I'll take you, please! Where's your daughter, huh? Where is she? - How much further? - [Jim] I don't even know what your girl looks like, all right? Just keep going down a little more. I think it's about 1/4 mile up the road. - You better be right. Is that the one there? - Yeah, that's the one. Just let me go, please? I told you everything. - She's in there? Are you sure? - Yeah, man. Please untie me, please? - Who else is in there? - I don't know man. Look, I only drop off some speed here, all right? I got nothing to do with the girl, man. I swear. I fucking, I never touched her man, I never touched her. Just let me go, please? What are you doing, man? - Sit tight. - What are you doing? - [Dane] You're not going anywhere. - Please don't. (crying) Come on, man. Come on, man. I told you everything I know, man, come on. Let me go, let me go. Let me go. (crow cawing) (speaking in foreign language) - [Man] Over here! - [Eden] Daddy? Daddy? I still love you, Daddy. (dramatic music) (gun firing) - Come out. Come out, man! Come on in. Come on, show yourself. (laughing) Come on, show. (gun firing) (Willy laughing) (gun firing) (Willy groaning) I've been shot. - Is she here? (Willy laughing) (Willy groaning) - She screamed real hard. Oh, you're too late, man. She's fucking dead. You're too late! (Willy screaming) (gun firing) (Willy gasping) (woman screaming) - [Woman] Hello? (knocking on walls) (gun firing) - Are you alone? Don't be afraid. I'ma get you out of here. Take my hand. I'll take you out. Oh shit, get down, get down. Stay here and stay down. (dramatic music) - [Willy] What, what? - He's behind us. - Ah! - Look, man, look. Fucking car's right behind us. - All right. - How did he fucking get here so fast? (Willy grunting) Come on, come on, he's getting closer. (Willy grunting) He's getting closer, man, come on. He's getting closer. Get out, get your ass out there. Shoot him, Willy. - I got him. - Shoot him. - I got him. (gun firing) - Yeah. Hit him again, hit him again. Hit him again, Willy. - I'm working on it. (guns firing) He's still coming! - Come on, we're running out of real estate, Willy. - Hurry up, hurry up! - Go for the front tires. - Fuck you! - Go for the front tires. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! - What? - We lost him, we lost him, we lost him! Get back in. You all right, yeah? (Willy groaning) Get some Band-Aids for that. - Band-Aids. - Fucking asshole, let's get the fuck out of here. Yeah. - Ah, fuck! (speech drowned out by music) (somber music) - Where's my daughter? Where is she? (dramatic music) (baby Eden crying) (Zoe gasping) (gentle music) (monitor beeping) - The mystery man survived a violent shootout. The kidnappers of Viola Anderson, an innocent 14-year-old who was kidnapped in the neighborhood of Mammoth Park last November while walking her dog. The confrontation ended a few miles away from this home down the street in a car wreck. Two suspects were killed in the crash. As Rosemead investigators continue their search for this mystery man, the locals and the girl's family are now starting to call him a true hero. - One of the suspects in this case was Jim Tomanak. I just wanted you to know. - At least that girl's home tonight. (Fini sighing) (solemn music) - Can I please go home? (crying) - Fini, Fini. She changed her tune. Her friend admitted to stabbing Smith. Just thought you'd wanna know. Get some rest. - Hey. Hey, good morning, sunshine. Oh, oh yeah. Oh, it's so good to see those eyes. Hi, hello, nurse! Hello, oh. (Fini grunting) (somber music) (phone ringing) - [Todd] You're inside. - It's okay Mr. Meisner. It's okay. Just try to relax. Okay, squeeze my fingers, okay? Just keep squeezing, good. You're doing good, good job. - Todd. - Yeah. Hey. - Thanks for calling me. I need to ask him some questions right away. How long until I'm able to? - It'll take him some time to recover. From what we're seeing so far this morning, he's been showing signs of rapid progress. - [Todd] Right here, I'm right here. - Where are they? Where are they? Eden? Eden? They came in, they were inside. They were inside. - They're trying to pin some shit on me, bro. Not a big deal. I've dealt with worse. - Hey, that's not gonna happen. Ross is out of a coma. He's recovering. He'll vouch for you. - That was never supposed to be like this, bro. Ever since we got back, things haven't been the same. I know I have gone overboard with the drinking and haven't been myself, but people around here, treating me like I'm a fucking retard. - I'm sorry. I know I haven't been around for you as much as I wanted to be. - Nah, bro. You've been supporting your family. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I wasn't there to protect her when you couldn't. I failed you. I failed Eden. I've been trying, though. I really have. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - Civilian life has no meaning to me anymore. I'm better off in here. - Listen to me. Listen to me. I'm going to find Eden and then we're gonna get you out of here. You have my word. - It's all good, bro. (Smith sniffling) (people chattering) - You okay, Detective? Careful, it's hot. - Oh, I only ordered one. - It's my lunch time too. - Oh. (chuckling) - And you look like you could use some company. - Thank you. - Plus, I'd also like to get to know my best tipper. - (laughing) That's a cute kid. - Do you have any kids, Detective? - Um, Fini, please. No, I do not. - Neither do I. But if I did, I sure as hell wouldn't let them be glued to crap like that. I mean, when I was kid we used to go play outside with friends, no such electronics to get glued to. Didn't you? (dramatic music) It's crazy. - Oh, shit. - What? - Thank you so much for the soup. Mr. Hunte. - What's this? - Your daughter had a tablet she used. Do you have access to that? - Yeah, we'd watch cartoons on it together. I gave it to her for her birthday. - Do you happen to know the login information? - Yeah, I think so. - [Tanke] You got something? - Yeah, email and password to the cloud connected to Eden's tablet. - [Tanke] What tablet? We never got a tablet from the house. - Exactly. - What does that mean? - It was connected to a WiFi internet signal there. Gray dot means the device went offline at that location. - Looks like that's right at Meisners'. - Yeah. I'm pretty sure while it's in lock mode, the device can still keep track of itself for at least 24 hours or so. But in order for us to locate it, it needs to be on and connected to a WiFi signal again. - Oh, shit. Green dot. - It's on and connected. - Who could that be though? - 1805 Coldwater Canyon Road. Hands up. Keep your hands up. Sit. - It's clear. Relax, kid. Put your hands down. - Have you seen a tablet around here? - Bottom drawer. This is my dad's place. I'm just kinda hanging out right now. - Where did you get that? - I found it. I didn't steal it, I swear. It just came off of our B84 truck a few days ago. My buddy's gonna fix the screen for me. - B84 truck? - Yeah, the trash truck. - It's very important you tell us where you got that. Can you give us the exact route of the B84? - Sure, yeah. - [Officer] Clear! - [Officer] Clear. - [Officer] Clear. - [Officer] Clear. - [Tanke] All clear, sir. - [Captain] Okay, secure the entire perimeter. - [Tanke] Yeah. - So, what do you think? - We're late. - Yeah. Forensics on their way. - We're fucking late. Tanke. Grab that, grab that. Open it. (Fini grunting) Hey. (siren wailing) - [Eden] Daddy! - Babe. - Well, I'm a nice guy, right? - Yeah, yeah, you are. - Plus, if I didn't do anything you'd give me shit, so. - That's very true. - Hey. (sighing) Welcome home, buddy. - Thanks. - Okay, that's a long enough hug. - You look good. - Thank you. So, is Eden here? - Yeah, upstairs napping. Food's ready, though. - Okay, can I wake her? - [Dane] Go for it. - All right, thanks. Thank you. - Yeah. (phone chiming) Ross? Ross? Whose phone is that? - Guys, food's about to get soggy. - Hey, whose phone is this? What? What are these threats? - What the hell am I reading? - The firm, they gave me anything that I wanted. The house, the cars, for free. - Yeah, bonuses. - No, they weren't bonuses. I thought that that's what they were, but that's not what they were. They had me bill clients outrageous fees until I paid them back. But it wasn't enough. I uncovered dirt about the firm, money laundering and fraud. I threatened to talk, and that's when the harassment began. (suspenseful music) I'll go get him. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. (Eden screaming) - Get out of my house! (Ross groaning) Oh, my god! - [Kidnapper] Mr. Lewis would like you to get back to him. Make your payments and keep your motherfucking mouth shut. (Eden screaming) Fuck! Just bring her, come on. (Eden screaming) - Shh! I've got her! (Eden screaming) (phone ringing) - Hey, hey, we got a problem. - You were supposed to only shake him down. You know he's in a fucking coma right now. - Well, he shot at us. Look, things got wild. I had to do what I had to do. Plus, I'm sorry boss, but we had a witness. - What witness? - [Kidnapper] Their little girl. - (scoffs) What are you saying, you fucking idiot? They don't have a little girl. - Fuck. - [Lewis] Where is she now? - We have her here. What do you want me to do with her, sir? - I don't know. That wasn't part of the plan. - Well, we could just seal her off in here. - Yeah. Yeah, do that for now. Let me figure out a way to get rid of her. And don't call me anymore. - I'm sorry. I had no idea that they were gonna take it this far. Eden, she's my... - What were you thinking? - I promise that I will do whatever it takes to fix this. - My daughter was kidnapped and held in a fucking warehouse for days. My innocent, seven-year-old daughter, from your house. You've done enough. I'll take it from here. (dramatic music) - [Bodyguard] We got two bikes here. - Hey, Raz, keep an eye on those two bikes in the back. - [Driver] The fuck? - [Bodyguard] Hey, why didn't you make the turn, huh? Hey! Hey! I'm sorry, Mr. Lewis. (Lewis sighing) - I got a couple of maggots rolling up on us. - All right, here we go. Here we go. - Lock and load. Take care of it. - Got it. There's one on your left. There's another one coming around! - We got two more back there. - What do I pay you guys for? What the fuck is going on here, man? - [Driver] Coming from behind! - Come on, way to go. I'm out. I'm out. - Son of a bitch. - [Driver] Hey, man, I'm gonna speed up. - [Kidnapper] Hang on. Fuck! - Yeah, they got us! - [Kidnapper] Joe, get the wheel! Get the wheel! (Lewis scoffs) (Lewis sighing) - [Dane] Fred, roll the window down. I'm walking over now. (gun firing) - Ah! Ah, fuck. (Lewis panting) - You're part of Roselli's guys, huh? - [Dane] I did this, all of this. - Go ahead, kill me. Then what? - [Dane] Part of me aches for vengeance for what you've done, but this isn't that. This is a warning. If you ever come near my family again, I will finish what I started tonight. - [Harry] We're good? - [Dane] I'm good, Harry. (Lewis sighing) (phone beeping) (gentle music) (Princess barking) - Come on. Come on, Princess. Good girl. Come on. Do you wanna race? - [Dane] Sure. - Ready? - Ready. - Set. - Set. - Go. - Go. Miss you always, babe. - [Eden] Hurry up, little cheater. I'm winning.
