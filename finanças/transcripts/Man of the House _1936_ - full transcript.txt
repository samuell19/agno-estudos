I heard so. I want to see him. Yes, I do, too. Shut up! You cannot sing in public with your voice. Tôchuken, he took his name from a restaurant in Shizuoka. They say he couldn't stay in Tokyo, because of his scandals with a woman. Don't go back to Tokyo! You will get in trouble, again! When he left Yokohama with his wife, it seems they were sad. It's their destiny. No, it's his ability! We will arrive in three hours. In three hours, we'll be in Tokyo? Fool, have you forgotten that we stop at Kôzu today? Oh yes! We stay at Kôzu to see his son and we go to Tokyo tomorrow. Shizuoka! Shizuoka! Yes, it's Shizuoka. Shizuoka. Yes, we left the train at Shizuoka. Why? I don't know. No, Master changed his mind and suddenly got off the train here... .. and he hasn't come back yet. If we don't catch it, the next train will be at 7:00. Even Uncle Shôichi hasn't come back. Where did he go? Genta! Can't you see him? No. I don't know... We don't know where he is now. He must just be taking a walk around. He seems different since yesterday. I don't know what he is thinking. Tomorrow is a very important day for him. Seihei... how can you read a book now?! Why? Why? Can't you see that we've got a problem? But, he's not here. What can we do? When we noticed, he had already left. He sent a telegram to Hamamatsu, didn't he? Yes. - Where to? - To Kôzu, to Sezaki Sentarô. Do you know who he is? He is the Master's son. I've just heard about it. Do you know what he wrote in it? He had changed his mind and he wouldn't get off at Kôzu, but at Shizuoka. What? Why didn't you tell us that? Because he asked me not to tell you. What were you thinking?! It's strange if he asked you not to tell us! Please calm down. I can't talk on the phone. What? So, I asked his wife, but she doesn't know where he is. What? He is here! Is it him? Ah, it's Mr. Honda... How was it? I couldn't find him. - But the way he looks is... - Nobody saw him. I don't know what to do. I've called Tokyo and they say they've sold many tickets to his show. What is he doing? As it's the biggest stage in his life, he must be afraid of it. Did you tell him something? No. After Nagoya, he seemed depressed. Maybe, he doesn't want to go to Tokyo. Do you know me? Yes. No, you don't know me. If you'd really know me, I'd give you this ring. I've seen you in a newspaper. Not that one! You really don't know me? - Tôchuken is... in Japan... - Fool! No, not that one. I'm talking about my past. Your past... Well... it was in a small theater ... the name was... Eiheitei... Do you know it? And the name of place was... Kogichô? Yes, it is. It's more than 10 years ago. You haven't changed since. You came to the waiting room of Eiheitei and talked a lot. I'm so surprised! You are the son of that shopowner near the theater, right? I'm really surprised. Don't you remember me? I recognized you when you came in. Are you all right? We saw him in the waiting room... Yes, you are... I wasn't well known at that time. It's not true. Yes, it was me. At that time, I was just an assistant at the theater. I separated with my dead brother there. It's been a long time ago, but I remember it very well. Master, where're you going? Excuse me, are you Tôchuken? And you? I'm an officer of this city, Tomioka. I'm your fan. I'm promoting you. We have a party here... ...and there are many officers from this city. I'll introduce you to them. I don't care about that. Don't you have real geisha here? Because they don't know about you... ...Anyway, let's drink later. Where are you going? Bring me sake. Did you change rooms again? Ah! It's Shôichi! Yes, it's me. Where is he? We were looking for you. He won't come back. Where is he? Well... .. he's in a... bar with a... big pond. Pond? Ah, it's Fugetsu... Yes, it's Fugetsu. It's the best bar in Shizuoka. Don't kid us! Is he drinking? Yes, he's called for a lot of geisha and is having a big party. Why did you come back here alone? Because we don't have money to pay them. Tomorrow is a very important day for him. Yes, that's why. He goes to play in Tokyo. I'm proud of him. If you knew that, why didn't you bring him with you? Had he been the kind of man who listens to me, he wouldn't have got famous. I don't know what he is thinking. He has a son who has been waiting for him for a long time. There are many people who are waiting for him in Tokyo, too. He says he doesn't want to see his son, right now. No kidding! Recently, he was looking forward... .. to seeing his son, and wanted his photo! Did he say that he didn't want to get off at Kôzu? Hello, Madam. Did he say anything else? No... Anything else... Give me a bag, please. Let's go and get him. If we leave now, we can catch the 7:00 train. - Can you prepare our departure? - Yes! Why did you get off here? Ah, good timing. We got trouble. I'll talk with him. He is not here. He is drinking in a bar. Madam... .. what happened? As one of his old friend since the Osaka days, I had decided to celebrate his coming, even putting aside my business for now. I managed to take a day off, and came to Numazu. When the express train arrived in the station, I jumped into the car with champagne in my hands crying "Hail to Kumoemon!". You know who I saw there? Nobody! I'm sorry. It happened so suddenly. Otsuma-san, I want to talk with you. Uncle, wait a minute, I'll go with you. But, I'm a bearer. He will be angry with me, if I'm late. You must know the reason why it happened. Please, tell me. Yes. He must be afraid of the big stage in Tokyo, right? He was not afraid, but he didn't want to stop at Kôzu. Why? He has a son whom he had with his ex-wife in Kôzu, and he left him with his mother there 8 years ago. Why doesn't he want to see his son? It's Sentarô and I take care of him. He looks forward to seeing him. When he was in Kyûshû, yes, he wanted to see him. But, I don't know why, he has changed his mind. No... Everyone has one's own door in mind. Even a wife cannot see inside it. You are so timid. Why don't you try to fight with him? You are a coward, really. Mr. Kurata... Alright... I'll put it bluntly. Only I can tell it to you and you can only accept it from me. It's not because of Sentarô that you don't want to go to Tokyo, but because you have had a big scandal there. You go back to Tokyo to see what you did 8 years ago. There are people who are waiting for you to criticize what you did. Wait, please! Let me go, please! You cannot behave like this. You have to be brave. Even if he is a performer, they won't forget what he did. You talk too much. No, it's not too much. Because of it, he could develop his act. I don't know. Let me go, please! He can't live without his act! Let me go, please! It's our problem. I don't listen to what people tell us. It's not only a problem between you and him. Yes, it is. It's only between us. I don't ask anyone. It's only me who can console him. Otsuma-san... Don't come here. It's between us. Don't finish your story before the climax. So, what did you do? No, you won't understand. We are serious. Hello. What are you talking about? I began my old story again. It's good. So, what's it about? He used to be an itinerant musician. Yes, when he was young. It was a hard period for him. Shôhei... I don't want to go to Tokyo. But... If it's possible, I want to stay like before. I'll work for other performers... You're kidding. I'm serious. My life has changed suddenly. Who is Tôchuken? Who is Kumoemon? My life was better when I was poor. Please, wait! I'll ask him! It's alright. I've already talked to him. Well, uncle... Tôchu... Your wife, she took care of me... Hey! Tôchuken! And you helped her a lot. Hey, Tôchuken... She always had a toothache. But you were always drunk and didn't take care of her. Tôchuken, open this door! I was not kind to her. I didn't have enough money to call a doctor... Tôchuken, why didn't you answer me? But, even you didn't care of her, she really loved you. Don't tell me that. They are waiting for you. Let me introduce you to them. Who are you? I'm your admirer. They want to hear your voice. Please come with me. Please go away. I'm talking to my Master. Isn't it so, old man? Tôchuken, you won't sing for officers? I promised them! I'm a customer here. Please go away. You are just a performer. You are too impertinent! You have to sing for them! Come! Wait, wait! I'm the famous Kumoemon. I'm no cheap entertainer. What! Wait, wait! He isn't a bad man. It is just because it's you. Damn it! I won't forgive you if you don't sing. I'll take you there. Wait! Stop! Anyway, Kumoemon, why don't you drink with us? So we don't regret this later. No thanks. You cannot afford my performance. It's much too expensive. We welcome you, not as a performer, but as a gentleman. Then, you can ask the Kumoemon whom you imagine. It's not me! You have to behave as a performer. What?! You can perform your act thanks to us. You should think about that. It's none of your business. Now, I forget about Kumoemon and Tôchuken. Why do you disturb me? We are sorry, really sorry. Anyway, you will play in a big theater. My masters will be surprised, if they find out. I'm happy to see you, and I appreciate that I'm still alive. Uncle, let's go. Master, you are drunk. Why don't you have a seat? No, thanks. It's better for me like this. Tôchuken! What will you do? What will you do tomorrow? Tell me! Are you such a cowardly person? What? Are you afraid of Tokyo? What? I'm not afraid of Tokyo. Then, why did you get off the train? You'll never know how I feel. You say I'll never know? I'm Kumaemon. I don't want to work for you. I decided to go there anyway. Then, you are going to Tokyo, tomorrow? I'm saved. That's good. - And I want you to meet someone. - Sentarô? Yes. He came from Kôzu because he wass worried about you. Will you see him? Why did you change your mind? I didn't want to see him like this. Will you see him or not? Sentarô is there. Sentarô! It's your father. Salute him. Sentarô. Do you remember me? Yes. Do you? Yes. I remember you. Kurata. I want to drink. Let's drink until morning. Sentarô. I'll introduce her to you, but not today, later. Yes. Otsuma. I want to sing for him. Could you play? Yes. I haven't heard your song in such a long time. I don't know whether I can sing well, as something is blocked here. I'd have gone to see her, if we had had time. Yes, they would have been glad to see me. No way, if women see you, they'll run away. Sentarô... .. your father's body is full of scars, as his life was full of problems. You cannot think me higher only by my reputation. Sentarô... .. my father was a performer, Yoshikawa Hidekichi. I'm his son. Listen to my song. Even if Kumoemon's body is full of scars, he will fight for his performance. Did you hear about Kumoemon? He is so popular! His performance was not suitable at all for a big theater before. It means he must have improved his performance a lot. Admission fee is 1,000 yen? I've never seen such an expensive performance of Naniwabushi. So, it must be a good show. You can take as much as you pick up with chopsticks. Good evening. Good evening. It's all set, Master. Let's go home, then. Go home? Yes. Let's go home. What's your name? Chidori. Chidori? Chidori... Your wife hasn't been feeling well recently. You shouldn't trouble her. When I see Chidori, my performance is better. But, she stays there and as you are a famous person... I'll ask her to come to Shinbashi. Master, there are birds over there! Good! I'll get them. Master, don't' get too close. As he can't hit any, he gets close like that! I think I got one. It's broken into pieces. I need Chidori for my performance. I can take her youth and innocence into my performance. I use everything for my performance. Master, look at this. I'm home. Welcome home. How are you? Not as good as usually, but I'm all right. I see. Sentarô. How's your school? Do you have any friends? Yes. If you need money to buy things for school, you can tell me anything. Your father doesn't care about it. Mother? Yes? I don't like his life. You can't say that. You will understand it someday. But you are... If it's for his performance, we have to accept everything. Look at this. They talk about him, again. Where? "A scandal of Rôkyoku's master. " - What is it? - Nothing. So, let me see. Why do you get excited with this? No,... - As his pupils, you are impudent! - Even a pupil reads a newspaper. What?! You really are impudent! Stop! Stop it! What are you doing? Mother! What's wrong? What is it? - In that newspaper? - No, it's not for you! No! Chidori. What do you think about me? What? Do you like me or not? Why do you ask me that? I've always told you that I like both you, and your acting. You are in a good mood. Madam, recently, my performances have been very good. Because you are with a young beautiful, woman. You have to be cherished by him. I want to talk to you. Chidori, could you leave us alone? Her debut as a geisha seems to be quite expensive. I don't care about money. Then I'll start preparing it. Mr. Kurata has come to see you. Kurata? Let him come in. Welcome. I came here to tell you something you won't like. What is it? Why don't you think about Otsuma? If you leave her now, can you imagine how lonely she'll be? She doesn't care about my lovers. But, she is a woman. She is a performer, too. She will understand it. Tôchuken, you're trying to evade her. What? You don't want to see your past, do you? Fool! I'm not such a coward. It's not so. Never. Otsuma. You missed twice today. Was anything wrong with my acting? I couldn't cry as I was playing. Bring your shamisen here. I won't. You can ask that woman. Otsuma? Yes? What do you think about my last performance? I think I can't play like before, anymore. Even though I try hard, as I'm sick, I can't play as I'd want to. I don't think so. Are you really a Master of Tôchuken? Even though you can't complain to your wife? I can't help crying, seeing you like that. Even if you're my wife, you can't just say anything about my performance! You used to hit me when my shamisen wasn't good enough. You loved me not as a woman, but as a performer. You made use of everything for your performance. You used to be a strong man who could forget everything for his acting. Have you forgotten the times we walked together in small towns, in Kyûshû? Even though we were a couple, we were always rivals on the stage. We improved our performance by competing with each other. I know what you mean. When we had to leave Tokyo, our lives were much more dynamic. Now, by coming back here, we lost that dynamism. I miss it so much. If your performance is getting worse because of that, your performance is not the real thing. No. The worse it becomes, the more people like it. How old are you? Are you old enough to say that? I won't live long. Why do you say that? I know it very well, because it's about myself. But, if you are like now, I can't die. You made use of everything, even your women, even your wife. Finally, you began to worry about your wife's shamisen. It's enough! Otsuma! "A Scandal Of A Rokyoku Master." Otsuma won't come back? You can't do your performance without her shamisen, can you? I'll ask Uncle. As she is sick, I have no choice. Yes, she is sick, but she also worries about your relation with Chidori. I read about it in newspapers. She will never come back, if she reads this. What do you think about my acting, lately? What? I don't know... If you have something to say, please tell me. Well... Please, tell me in all honesty! Well, as you don't know how my Kyûshû act was... What does Kurata say? Master? What are you thinking at? Otsuma left home and hasn't come back for 3 days. So, did you go there to ask about your mother's sickness? Yes. What did her doctor say? It's not so serious, but she has a little problem with her bronchi. I see. Didn't you go to school today? No, I didn't feel well today. Your father is worrying about you as you look a little depressed. As you are young, you have to be more active. Yes. Also, you are the son of Kumoemon. You have to be strong. When he was your age, he was so dynamic... Yes. I can't be like him. Don't say that. You are too timid when you are with your father. Father cares about the others, but never about his family. You have to tell him whatever you think. He will be happy about that. It's hot! Hot! The Master wants to send someone to India. India? For what? He says there's a big wooden gong we can't buy here. He wants to have it. But he shouldn't send someone to India just to buy it, even though he collects them! He decided to collect 1,000 wooden gongs so as to not to... .. forget the difficult life he lived when he was poor. But why a wooden gong? Because he couldn't buy a shamisen when poor, he played with a wooden gong. Please. I will pay even if it's very expensive. Really? Did you know about this? This is from Mr. Okazono in Chiba. What is it? Did you buy land in Shibakôen for 50,000 yen? Yes, yes. When I was drunk, I talked about that with him. Please tell me when you do things like that. When I get drunk, I always do something. I don't want to do it, though. You shouldn't talk a lot. When you are drunk, you talk too much. It always gives me a problem. A politician came to see you. About Gifu company? There is no more space in your schedule. It's a contribution. Just for 3 days. Couldn't you manage it anyhow? Thanks to you, we got a good contributor. I'm very close to him. Even Mr. Ôkuma was so impressed by his performance. His recent performance is excellent. His performance is something instigative. He is famous everywhere. He would be a good politician. Hello. Is your father in? I don't know. Really? You didn't go to school today? No. Don't you like your school? Yes I do, but I couldn't sleep well last night. Really? Even though you are still young? Did father came home late last night? It was in the morning. I don't know how he can continue like that! Doesn't he ask about Mother? Mr. Isoda, why doesn't he come to see her? Did you think about that? I thought about that last night. You shouldn't think about that. Your father and mother have a lot of problems. Don't think about that. Where is Father? He is in the bathroom. What is it? Do you want to tell me something? You can tell me anything. Sentarô... do you want to go to Fukuoka? I know a good person who can take care of you. Weakness is the worst thing about a man. I could survive until now because of my toughness and patience. If I didn't have them, I don't know where I'd be now. You are too weak to be a Master. Your hands are too soft. What's wrong with you? You have to tell me frankly, like a man should do! You cry too easily. I don't like a weak man. It's about Mother. What? Father, please don't see Chidori. What? It's for Mother. Please don't call Chidori here. It's none of your business. Don't tell me that! She is here now. Please ask her to leave. Chidori! Father! Stop it! At Shizuoka, I told you that I was full of faults, don't ask me to be perfect. Master! What happened? You have to leave! Leave! Fool! Don't you understand? Sentarô! You dare disturb me?! Please, tell her go, please. Master, please stop it! Master! Don't disturb me. Don't! It's he who disturbs my performance! Stop, stop it! If you want, you can hit me. What?! I don't care who he is! I have to protect my art! Anyway, it's enough! They want to see me as a perfect person, because of my success. I want to be just a performer. I have nothing and I'm full of faults. I've built up my art on my faults. However... .. even Sentarô tries to see me as a perfect person, he tries to see me separate from my art. Yes, yes. I'll take care of him. He goes to school and he can study there. I don't need anything. I just want to be a performer. If I'm a performer, it's enough for me. You are fine, having a house, and living with Master, but, please, think about Otsuma. I really don't know. As she is sick, she must think ill of him. I don't know what to do... .. as he doesn't tell me anything about that. She is Master's wife, still she sleeps on a futon smeared with blood. So, I sent a new one to her. Do you know what they say in newspapers? "They can say what they want. " What? It's not I, but the Master who says so. Don't you care what they say? They say that he is cold and cruel... .. as he doesn't care about his sick wife. I always ask him to let me go to the hospital. But he says he can't enter the hospital because he is sorry for her. Has he come? No. You have never loved me. You have only loved my shamisen for your shows. No, no, I didn't... Master. Where're you going? Just around there. Isoda... .. Otsuma won't get well... I know. I know you go to see her so often. Thanks. It's all right. Welcome home. Master, a doctor called you yesterday. And this morning, he was waiting for you. I know. Why don't you go to hospital? They think it's because of me. Otuma must hate me now. I went to see her two weeks ago. Even at that time, I couldn't look at her face. I thought of her as a real artist, but now, at the end of her life, I don't want to think that she is just a woman. Even though she calls me hundreds of times a day, I don't answer. Because I don't want to think that she is just a woman. I want to remember her as a woman who lived only for art. I don't care what they call me. I just don't want to be more sad than I am now. She curses me! She tries to kill me! Chidori. You made a big mistake. She became crazy. What did I do? Whenever she sees that futon, she becomes crazy. Why? Doesn't she like it? It wasn't a good one. I didn't think about that. What was wrong with it? Its design. It's with a cherry blossom, and a strip paper with a poem written on it. When she reads that poem, she says: "She curses me!" What poem is it? You know the scene in "47 Ronin" where the Daimyo who commits Harakiri delivers... .. a poem sent by his wife to his enemy, don't you? That's exactly the poem on the mattress! The one in which a woman curses her lover's wife. Though, they say that it is a popular Yûzen deseign. But, I... Don't tell the Master. But, I don't know what to do. Don't tell him. Don't give him any more troubles. It isn't only Otsuma who suffers by it. - I do so also. Please, tell her that. - Yes. It's not her fault. It's our fault. It'll be so for the rest of my life. Please ask her to keep it, and sleep quietly. Osada! Hasn't uncle come back? Uncle, the Master is waiting for you! I got a problem. What? Sentarô fought with his friends... - and he won't be able to stay in school. - Fight? They said that he swung around a dagger. Really? He was so timid...! I can't tell him that, because I'm sorry for him. I am tired of this, father and son, Master and pupil. I think we should live separately. It's a good idea, if we can. I'm serious. Me, too. You can go home today. - He is waiting for you! - Really? - Are you leaving? - Bye. Uncle, are you there? Is it true? Where's he? Has he come home? What happened? His principal scolded him, and told him to go... .. apologize to all of the students he fought with. Did he? The principal forced him to. Why didn't you take him here? He wanted to apologize, too. Damn! I'll kill him! But, his principal... Anyway, I'll kill him! I'll kill him! Kamata! It's good timing! Where is he? - Where is Sentarô? - I came home with him. You can't stay here! It's all right, I want to talk with him. No, he says that he will kill you. You cant's go. - I, I'll kill my son! - Wait, wait! If you hit Sentarô, I won't forgive you! It's not because he fought with his friends, but because he didn't fight with his hands, because he was mean. Have you any idea how he felt when he read about your scandal in newspapers? Because he is weak! You cannot say that! It happened because his friends insulted you. He wanted to protect your fame by his dagger. I'm not his father, he is too weak. I won't forgive you. Hello? Yes, it is. Yes, Tôchuken. Hospital? Yes. So, you told her what he said? "To sleep quietly?" Did you tell her? She was glad to hear it? She said: "I found my way at last. " "Otsuma won't die as a woman, but as a performer. I'll die quietly. Did she say so? Master! Master! Please hang up. Hang up, please. Please, please hang up! Otsuma. Otsuma. I'm sorry. And thank you for everything. Please, leave me alone. I want to stay with her. Tôchuken, please cry for her as much as you can. Otsuma. Please listen my song again. Are you ready? I'll begin. THE END
