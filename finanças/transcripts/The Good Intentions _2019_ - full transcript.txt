To my dad and to my mom. Hey, Manu! Manu, hey! Come on you lazy ass! Are you coming to the record store with me or not? I'm leaving in 15 minutes. Goal! Goal! -Great game. -Great game. What happened? Why are you all soaked? What time did the dinner end? Why didn't you tell me? They should have stayed with you! What dinner? There was a change of plans, River was playing at home! I had free tickets! This girl has a fever. Lala has a fever, didn't you notice? Amanda, where's her coat? Did you guys loose it? She didn't have it when we left school. And no one noticed! Now she's sick, she'll miss school tomorrow and I'll have to stay home. Come on, Ceci! She was fine a minute ago. Sure. So she got sick when she got here. The health insurance cards? I'll have to take her to the doctor tomorrow. Tomorrow I'll pay, promise. -Bye kids! -Bye Dad. Bye Aman, bye Manu. Everyone in! You're soaked, you'll get sick too. Manu, inside. Shut the door, Amanda, please. What's up, king of punctuality! Nestor! -Legend! -Nestor's here! -Watch the camera. -Nestor's here! Hi, my kiddos! Who are my little ones? One, two, ultraviolent. One, two, ultraviolent. One, two, ultraviolent. They want to transform us! They will not succeed! They will not succeed! One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, ultraviolent! -Dad... -Uh, uh... No, it's: "uh, uh..." - No! - Yes. I told you no. Dad! You're singing it wrong; it's "uh-uh" and you go: "aw-aw". Enough. Dad, how's it called? Try to sing it better and I tell you. It should be called "Uh-uh!" Are you sure this is the way? Look in the glove compartment, there's a map drawn on a napkin. Some directions you gave me, fuckface! Tiger. Park it over there. Careful with my car. It still has your souvenirs from last week. How are you? It's Mr. Samuel! King of the weekly logistics, master of interpersonal relationships, I have to talk to you. Please, come with me. What's with Sami's car? Did you crash it? Mind your own business, small fry. Put your swimsuit on. I'm throwing you into the pool ready or not. No! Amanda, put your swimsuit on he'll throw us in! He'll throw you in! Don't even think about it, Dad! Diving hurts my ears, you know. Come on, "Little Ceci", put Lala's suit on. I'll see you in the water. Hi! Gustavo, son of a bitch! -The boss. -Back off! Come on, let yourself be loved. Back off! Piece of shit. -What's up? -Doc. How's it going? You are wet! Shoot this, Chebu! Move a little bit... Another piano... ...so until March there's no piano at home. What a pity... Let's get out for a bit, La. Come on, your lips are purple and your eyes are red. Besides, I'm cold. Come on. But Dad hasn't said anything! He never does. Let's go! Very good meat, dude. Where did you buy it? Finally! That mosquito coil was killing me! Careful, Dad! You're going to burn her! - Aman... - Sorry. ...so you'll be flag bearer again? Dad, I'm one of the escorts! Flag bearers are from 7th grade! Flag escort, flag bearer... there's no difference. Either of both is perfect by me. There's no boyfriend, right? -Remember you're my girl! -Of course! So I don't have a boyfriend anymore? Yes, you do! Besides, Sami can have lots of girlfriends like my dad! Really? Is that so? Tell me more about it! Now press again. No, that one. I'm really a monster that climbs through your window and steps into your bed and doesn't let you sleep. I'm a gladiator, I'm Persian. I am the friend of the tacky. I'm a toilet, I'm Mexican and I'm a rifle. Cute! I'm Palestinian and I'm a refugee I'm the enemy of the sacred I am Lebanese, I am Paraguayan and like sheep they've killed us. And those treaties and those truces those bombs, those markets There you go! and those abandoned kids. And those women... ...also abandoned. A bar on the beach? But did he start it from scratch? He's huge... It would be great if it works. Spectacular. Much better than having money is having friends with money. You wanna come with me to drop off the kids and then watch the game at home? Yes, sure. But don't you have a date? Mariana? Almost a date. It's kind of fading. We'll see. You can always leave... Oh, no. OK. You can stay and watch. No, asshole, the cops. Random checks. Hide the weed in Manu's jacket. It's OK. We're off the hook. Good evening. Your license, please. Do you have some money? Gustavo. It's me, Ceci. Pick up. I need to talk to you on Thursday no matter what. It's important. Call me. -Hi. -Hi. If this is about what you found in Manu's jacket... No, Gustavo... ...it's got nothing to do with that. Although, honestly... ...I can't believe the amount of neglect, apathy and lack of responsibility in your life. I just don't understand. It's none of my business when you're alone, but when you're with the kids... ...I've asked you a thousand times to be more careful with them. But you don't care, I don't know what the fuck you are thinking... Ceci, give me a break! What I found in the jacket, believe it or not, is not a priority anymore, I need to talk about something else. Guille's family is offering him a great job, is a very good opportunity in Paraguay, where they live. So... ...we're moving to Asuncion. Who's moving? What do you mean "who"? Guille, me, the kids... The kids? All of them? Couldn't you tell me? I'm telling you now. Right. How long have you known this? Do the kids know? I don't get a say? Of course you do, that's why I'm telling you. Telling! You should be checking with me, not just telling! Please don't make me say it again. I hate it, I don't want to say it anymore! Guille and I can give the kids a better life. And have a better one ourselves. Besides, life here is impossible to afford and... ...I can hardly count on you. I don't want to fight. I swear. I don't. I'm just saying things as they are. I hope you can understand. Next year the kids would start school there. We can talk again next week if you want. Now you know. Think about it. Think what? You've made your decision! The kids don't know it yet. -Hi, Guille. -Hi, Gustavo Have you got all your stuff? Hi, Dad. Hi, Aman. This is Maria cooking. What is this crap? You didn't wash a single glass. I'm going to wash right now! I'm not washing anything anymore. -Anything else to declare? -Nothing else. A Perfect Day for Bananafish Hi. Amanda. She's Laura, but we call her Lala. - Hi, Lala! - Hi. -I'm Ale. -Dad had to leave. I made tea. It's linden tea, there's no other. We got used to it and now we find normal tea gross. Yeah! Thanks. I overslept. I have to leave anyway. Who likes Pink Floyd? Dad. Of course. But this isn't Pink Floyd. Lala, you left a bunch of cookies at the bottom of your cup! If you're leaving we'll watch a movie in Daddy's room. Yes, go ahead. I'll just get dressed and I'll leave. Lala! Can't you wait a sec? -She's leaving in a moment. -But she said it's OK. I'll prepare the movie, you go get dressed. Take off that t-shirt and put on the one that mom sent, it's in the bag. Wake up if you are alive. Inside you there's a great explosion. You can feel it if you're alive. if you are alive, if you are alive. Make your own life and don't complicate yourself so much. In the end everything is ending anyway. Don't be afraid and don't waste your time. Live your dreams, always your dreams. It's time to change there is no time to wait Life doesn't wait, enjoy the moment. Help me wake up your sisters, Manu! Girls, we've arrived! Dad, can you help me with the guitar? Yes. Come on, Lala. -Do I look like Sid Vicious? -Sure, if that was a bass. Bye, Jimmy! We'll stay with you again today, right Dad? Yes, your mom's got a thing. You all leave early today, right? I have to be at the record store at five. No, my rehearsal is at six. Can't you skip it just this time? Do me a solid, come on! Can I be the cashier? You can do whatever you like. But I have to be there at five! It's up to you, Dad. We'll be out at 4:15. I know that... Bye, Lala baby! Hurry, you're late. Don't bother me! Alfajores "Terrabusi". The bravest player on the field! I'm going to hit you. He never cries. Stop it! Still, they'll go where their mom goes. I'm not going to be a stick in the mud. You're already a stick... And when would that be exactly? End of this year, beginning of the next one. I guess they'll stay with me until the last moment. It'll be weird without the kids. Yes. What does Aman say? I think she doesn't know it yet. But I'm not sure. Anyway, this is just starting. Yes, I can tell because you're clueless as fuck. Look at that critter. Aman. What does it say here? I already told you: "Dick Tracy: records, cassettes and CDs." And who is this? It's Dick Tracy. Who is Dick Tracy? He's a dark detective from Dad's time. What do you mean "dark"? Did you finish, Aman? Once they pick that up, we're gone. Yes, but some of these songs aren't by The Ramones. Isn't this one by the Stones? None are by Ramones. It's a cover album. Shouldn't I write each performer? Does it fit? I'd have used a smaller font if I knew. Don't worry. Dad, what's "dark"? Your cousin Gonzalo is dark. Like Dick Tracy? Like this guy. I've come to get my recording tape. -Your name? -Gustavo. How much is it? That'll be $3, plus the tape, so it's $4. I have a $20. Dad, there's no change. Okay if I owe you 50 cents? Bye. Here, Manu. You won a prize for being two hours next to the speaker. Really? Thanks! I can't believe it! Look, Dad! Cool! Does it fit you? Isn't it too big? It doesn't matter, it will last longer! Thank you. Can I take something too? Choose whatever you want! It's my treat! Me too! -Lala, what do you want? -Los Violadores! You have all their albums! B-52 is better for a pretty girl like you. Yes, "Beastie two"! I'll choose one for you. Do you like this one? Is "Please, please me", the very first Beatles album? That's super right. Are you taking that one? Or do you prefer the White Album? It's a double... I don't know what to do. Take both. This is for you and the double is for all three of you. Thanks, you're the best! Manu, look! Go on, give them everything. All our profit comes from copying tapes anyway. You'll soon become aware. I can't believe they're leaving. Come on, fag. I'm the one who's their dad! Let's close. You guys go home. I have to wait for my lift. Are you going to the game? -Maybe. -I'm not. I'll have to watch it on TV. Come on, kids, grab your stuff. Yes. Bye, kiddos. Take care of the albums. Not a scratch or I won't give you anymore, okay? -Okay. -See you next week! Or in two weeks. Next week we are with mom. -Bye, Nestor! -Bye, sweetie! Wait fuckhead, I don't know if it's working! -Come on! -Okay. Go! Oh, what a burden this baby! Who's next? Come on, Nestor! Jump in! -I want to see it again! -No, Manu! Let's watch the whole thing, then you can put it on again! Are you alive? Let's see, what's going on here? You can't borrow my jacket, take it off. No, I'll check all the pockets. Let's see. Come on, take it off... -Dad! -What? What's in Gustavo García's jacket? Narcotics! Are you recording this? Let's see... -10:15. -What's that? Oh... It's soccer time! Hello? No! I lost track of time. Who scored? There's the replay. What a fantastic goal! OK, bye. Pass me another cigarette. You see? I told you that kid was doing well. You said he was crap and look: he scored 3 in 2! It's just luck, Cuqui is not good. You listen to your dad. You are still very young. Look at this one, I swapped it for 20 doubles I had. Tell me those you are missing, maybe I can get them. From River only Berti. -I have to write down the rest. -OK. Dad we're suffocating down here! Yes, Dad, we're suffocating! OK, parrot! Quite a hairstyle today! Come, I'll make you a ponytail. Don't pull my hair, okay? I won't. Stay still. Dad. Is Mariana your girlfriend? Well... girlfriend... Yes, she's your girlfriend! Girlfriend my balls. She's not his girlfriend, Vero is! Hey! Mind your own business! Is she or not? No. There we go, Lala. Don't touch it. It doesn't have any bumps, La! It's perfect! - It's perfect. - Yeah, "perfect". It's not perfect! It's perfect. Don't you know he's joking? Look at his hair: he looks like Woody Woodpecker. Woody Woodpecker! Aren't you supposed to get a ticket for the train? Yes, unless you know where to get on. The point is finding the pig. The what? The guard. He's in grey. Look for him. There! Come on! Come on, Lala. I hope you never fix the car! It's 5 past, Dad, we've got to run! It's the same, Amanda: 5 past, 10 past. You are already late. You can't be later than late. How are you? Sorry, I just left them. Late, right? Perfectly on time! Ok, so what are we doing? Can we grab a coffee around here? Let's talk while I pick up the car from the mechanic. It's nearby. Well, I don't know. It'll just be a second. So I can get it out of the way. Can't they go to another school? It's not only about the school. It's the school, it's the health insurance, the house... ...there we will have all of that taken care without struggling. They will come often. Can I tell them? Yes. They'll be with me this weekend. But... I'll pick them up on Friday at school and I'll take them to you on Saturday morning. But early. Please. Here. Amanda brought it from your place to read. Okay, I'll take it. It's yours. My dedication is right there, look. Shall I drop you off on Cabildo Street? Okay. -Sorry. -It's ok. A woman looking herself in the mirror or something. It's okay. But not her mother waking her up. No, not that. Who is "partner"? Amanda? Now I'm recording color to the minimum. She walks, walks down the street. She goes to bars, dressed like a woman... ...that might be good. I'd use...close-ups. And dreams, my partner they leave and never return. So many years went by and there's no lesson like that. Nice. Beautiful. Okay. Wonderful. Lala! Lali! I'm double parked! Tell your siblings to hurry. Dad! Dad's here! No, Dad always comes later. He's here! He came! He's "over parked"! There you are! Come, Manu. Dad's here! -Hi! -What happened? Nothing! I just came to pick you up. What happened, Dad? Were you running early? Come in, butthead! Are you tired, La? Why don't you take a nap? Hey... ...kiddos... Ceci and I were talking about something that... ...we think would be great, especially for you guys. What's up? You know how everything is here, right? In this country, there is no money. Well... ...your mom and Guille are not doing great with the pizza place and... ...here we hardly sell anything. You can't pay for our school? No. Well... Not this one, another one maybe. I want to go to one without German class. You can't switch to another school now! You have to finish this year first. No, this year you'll stay where you are. But next year if everything goes well... ...you'll start in another school in Asuncion. -All right! -What? Are we going to move to Paraguay with Mom? Yes, apparently there you'll live in a much better place. Did she ask you? Of course, kid! We decided it together. You're not going anywhere if I don't want you to go. It's going to be fine! Hey. Hey! You'll come often. And you guys love Paraguay. You went many times with your mom. But... are you coming too? Sure... ...I'll go visit you now and then. When are we leaving? In February. It's already decided? It almost is. Do you want us to go, Dad? What I want...actually... I'm not going. Come on, Amanda! -Stop it, everyone's going. -I'm not. I'm staying with you. With me? Are you nuts? No. -Why? -Just picture it! What? I'll stay here and I'll go visit them from time to time. Me too! OK. Stop it! We'll discuss it. Help me with Lala, I'll close. What? No! Come on! Kick it slowly! Good job! I don't see what's the problem, dude. She's setting up camp! I have a 2-room apartment, and I need 1 extra room, a room for me, basically. Why don't you go to your parents' country house? You have like 2000 acres there just for you. What the fuck are you doing? Can't you stretch well? You're the funniest guy I know, chief! I know. I'm doing it for you. Hey! Come on! Come back! Go, Dad! ...that day Dad scored 3 goals! Sure. Just on the day I didn't come. Yeah, sure! I think I was here! No you weren't. But I was here another time! Yes, you were here another time. Oh, it flies away. Here I go! Damn it, man! What? What the fuck is wrong with you? What did you say? Is Daddy going to fight? No. They always pretend they will but never actually do. If the kids weren't here you'd be dead, asshole! Wanna fight? Come now! Stop it! Are you crazy? The kids are here! Besides he'd kill you, asshole. Easy, boys! Amanda. Do you want tea or hot chocolate? Amanda. Hey! Tea or hot chocolate? Tea. Leave that and come to the table, please. Be careful. It's hot. -Mom. -Yes? When are we going to move to Asuncion? After the summer, I guess. When school starts. And what school will we go to? A beautiful one, the one Ani's kids go to. -Who is Ani? -Aunt Ani, Guille's sister. His cousin. Do you want some toast? Dad told me that if I really wanted, I could stay with him. Amanda... ...don't you know your dad? You're talking nonsense! Imagine what school you'll end up if you stay with him. Come on! He told me that I could stay in the same school. Sure. You're not listening to me. Don't you know your dad? Because I do know him. I've known him for a very long time and no matter what he promises, he ends up doing something else... He told me I don't have to leave unless I want to. OK? Eat! You too. Mom... ...are we leaving for sure? Yes. Unless I win the lottery or... ...even less likely, Gustavo starts helping in the maintenance of you three, yes we are leaving for sure. I don't want to go. And whom are you going to stay with? With Dad, who else? And where are you going to sleep? In a living room? What are you going to eat every day? Pizza? Did you think about that? Help me with the dishes. Dad could move. Your dad moves when someone lends him a place. Do you think many people is willing to offer a 3-room apartment for free? We just need two bedrooms. Two bedrooms are enough. It's called 3-room because of the living room. Would you let me stay if I had my own room? Room, school and health insurance payments up to date... ...it's a little bit complicated. If I had all those things would you let me stay? Amanda... ...do whatever you want. I'm not going to force you. Do whatever you want. But think hard! Really think what you want to do. Okay. Are you really staying with this one? He won't help you with your hair or your homework, he's a lousy cook... Dude- she already knows that... You do your hair yourself, right? I know how things are, OK? I don't need help with my homework either. I'm looking into getting a scholarship for school. Because it's expensive, you know? Don't worry, I've got it all figured out. She is going all the way, dude. Are you ready for this? I guess. It's quite crazy. It´s not going to happen. Hey, calm down! Are you crazy? Where is Aman? Here. You just have to sign here and fill out this part. -Here, the one you needed. -Great! "Father's occupation". Why didn't you fill that? I didn't know what to write. Moron! Employee? Whose? Yours, jerk, what's the difference? The less they know the better. How about "unemployed"? Do I look unemployed? No, but it'd help get the scholarship. Leave "employee", they'll still give it to you. If not, you'll have to leave with your mommy. Dad. I think those guys took the Marley double album... Fuck! this is what I get for dicking around with you! Move your fat ass and catch them! I do not want to write a blues song I do not want to see the light I just want to be with you every morning and your awakening to be better in these tough times the sun can still rise among the clouds. Fuck... It isn't easy... I'm short money. How much did you take from the store? 2, 3, 4... What a good neighbor. I'd kill you if I had to live with you. Yeah, I'd also kill me. Unbelievable. Why am I missing money? It must be here... -Weird... -What's up? - That lucky little bitch... - New girlfriend? Amanda. Her school's giving her a full scholarship. How so? Aren't they going to Paraguay? Looks like she's not. Great! Are you happy? How the fuck did she manage that? Dude! -The little lady is staying. -It's spectacular! But my apartment is too small. -Where will you go? -No idea. I need a bigger place. What about money? A higher rent, someone to feed every day... Are you going to cook? A bit of reality will be good for Amanda. More? I think she has enough to spare. Then why the worry? We're going to be fine. Do you have the keys? You just opened. I just need a bigger place. Do you know if Sami's bachelor's pad is available? It'll be free next month. -How many rooms? -No, but he wants to rent it out... -Exactly! -To someone who can pay for it. Exactly! Mattress! Genius. You could of stripped the bed before you moved. Sorry, no one helped me. I forgot about the sheets. You won't regret it, man! If these walls could talk, uh? Try not to say that in front of Paula, asshole... ...or I'll be needing this apartment again. I see there is some damage here. I just want to say you should have been present during the riot. Let's show... The house is great, man! It seems like a proper family house. It just has an extra room for Amanda... ...and for the kids when they come. So they don't have to keep sleeping in the living room. And here: a little pool. The pool should already be here! I do not know why it is not. Yes. I'm feeling good about Amanda staying. She can adapt to anything. You're looking much better already. Let's go with the ladies, it's a sort of stag night, isn't it? Something big is coming. I have a brother who plays the trumpet, he used to play the clarinet, my mother had a jazz band, and she was a piano teacher, she was a biochemist, but she was also a piano teacher... Then she created a jazz band and started to play the banjo. And my brother played the clarinet. Then he left for like 20 years... Manu, tell Mom he is here and we'll call her later. Go with him, La, I want to see if he's awake. But I really need to pee! It's just one second, La! Nestor. Nestor. Nestor. What happened? Hi. Nestor. Do you know if Dad's here? Hi, Aman! Hi. He's probably sleeping in his room. Did he know you're coming? Yes, I'm with the kids. They're outside. They're waiting for me. You see... ...there was a little party yesterday. Exactly. Is he alone? Who knows? I'll check. I'll knock on the door... No, no, no. I'll wake him up. He went to bed really late, poor thing. He was probably tidying up. Tidying up? Yes. This place is a disaster. Yes. Go wake him up. Lala needs to pee. Come on. Come on, Nestor! Get up, Nestor! Come in! Make yourselves at home! -Come on, she's about to pee! -Yes! Wait! Dad's still asleep. Then come back to the living room. What did Mom say? That you didn't say goodbye. Hi, Manolo. Nestor. What are you doing here? What am I doing here, asshole?! Who do you think was your doorman all night? You left the party right in the middle! - Has she gone? - No, she's here. Well, so are your three offspring. Oh, that's right, man! - What time is it? - Four. I need to ask you a favor... ...a huge favor, please. Take them to the park or something give me an hour, so I can clean this shithole. That will take more than an hour! No. I'm coming back in exactly one hour. Then I'll have to go to work at your store. - OK. Perfect. - Perfect...fuck you. Luli! Stay back. Yes, but he needs the guitar. When is Cecilia leaving? Next weekend. The kids will stay with her until Saturday and on New Year's Day we'll all go to the beach. Where to? Uruguay. Shorty rented a big house, so we'll all go there. Where is Dad? I need the guitar, Aman. Maybe I'll drop by some weekend and visit that dork. I'll stay the whole month unless I ran out of money. There might be a little job for me too, so... The whole month? When were you planning on telling me? Fortunately I stay at the store, taking care of your business, man! I don't know how you always manage to land on your feet. Me neither. Bye. I've got to be at a school event. Bye. The camera, Nestor? It's in the backseat. Bye, legend! Bye, champ. ...on this important day let's receive our national flag with love and respect. Carrying the sovereign badge... -Hi. -Hi. And Vero? Who? Vero! I saved a seat for her. Great! Would you take all this? The camera is super heavy. Ah! And take the crafts with you. I'm going to film Manu! You already missed Lala. -I'll film her alone, later. -OK. Ceci. Great, kiddo! All right, Manu! Well done, Aman! Good job! Way to go! Can I keep the Sebastian the Crab mug? Yes, it's yours! But you gave it to me! She needs a mug to have breakfast every day, La, you've got loads. Fine. You keep it. But take care of it, OK? Yes. Make sure you use the lotion I put in the bag for the kids. If you don't, then you'll burn. Use it when you leave the beach, so your skin won't peel. -Remember that, Aman. Your dad won't. -I will, Mom. Don't worry. Did you hear, Manu? When Amanda says so, you'll put on the lotion. Otherwise it'll burn, you won't be able to sleep. -You too, little one, huh? -Yes! I love putting on lotion! Call Granny if you need anything. As soon as we get there I'll give you our number so you can call us. OK. You're going to be fine. You know you can always come. Whenever you want, come with us. Don't worry, Mom. All right, little ones. Be good on your trip. I love you very much, Amanda. Me too. Bye Mom! Bye, baby. I'll call you tonight. -Phone me tonight! -Yes. -Don't cry. -No, I don't. You. Are you going to give me a hug? Go ahead. Come here. Do as Amanda says, OK? Always. Ok? Don't worry. Good luck there! Listen. Amanda has the three travel permits. Try not to lose any. Let me know if there's any problem, I'll come for her. -In that case I'll send her, relax. -OK. Gustavo. Take care. Our passports? Let's watch a movie! Yeah, The Little Mermaid! Bye, Mom! See you in Paraguay! Bye! Did it have to be the last one, dad? We are closer now. I don't want to I don't want to be with you ever again because I know, everything's alright everything's alright everything's alright. I don't want to I don't want to go to work ever again because I know, everything's alright everything's alright everything's alright. I skipped the appointment I skipped the appointment and the doctor will be mad because I know, everything's alright everything's alright everything's not alright. I don't want to January sun, stay a little longer because now everything's alright everything's alright everything's alright... That was beautiful, man. Beautiful. How did you add the music? With a new gadget. You connect the camera to the VCR and when you're transferring you can add any music you want reducing the original sound or just leaving it. Great. Would you roll a joint? Yes. Go to your room for a bit, kids. Nestor and I need to talk about a couple of things. We want to watch TV! OK, it'll be just 10. Don't you kids need to finish packing? -Have you done any of it? -Aman has to help us. I did mine already! Very good, Laluchita. You're the best. Putting your doll in a bag isn't packing, you know? You see? Go get everything ready and then come back. What time should we be at the airport? They have to be there at 3. So we'll be leaving at 2:40. We should be earlier. We'll have to take them ...to the one who'll put them on the plane. Do you have the tickets? I have them! Wait. Wait a second. Here. It's better if I keep them. Come on, guys. Come on, Manu. Hold on, we forgot these. Dad gave them to me. Did he say you could have them? Sure! Ask him! Are you going to visit us? Yes, or you'll come here... When? Before you realize. I always realize... I am truly a monster that climbs through your window Did you gather your dirty clothes, Lala? There they are. I am a murderous Latino... Now there's much more space. Hi, Mom. It's me. Aman. Yes, everything's OK. OK dudes, I'm off! -Shall I pop by tomorrow at 1? -1:30! -Bye, Aman. -Bye, Nestor. See you tomorrow? Bye, kiddo, I love you. I love you too. I believe that's not yours! Come on, a little roach for the uncle... Bye, bye, asshole. So? Do the little ones have their things all ready? Yes. What's the matter? I think we should get to the airport earlier! Oh, Amanda. We'll get there fine! Don't be a pain in the ass. -Dad... -What? What are we having for dinner? I'll make some noodles. Anything else "little Cecilia"? We'll get there OK, Aman. We can leave 15 minutes earlier if you want. It's fine. Did you give Manu the songbooks? No, but let him have them. And Lala's taking your dolls from the living room. I gave them to her. But then you tell me off when your things go missing! When did I do that? If all goes well, we can go visit them in May. By car, or maybe even by plane! I don't know if I'll be able. Of course you will! In winter holidays or a long weekend. You don't need to have perfect attendance! I don't know if I can handle it. It's great here, but without the kids... ...I hadn't thought about it. Yes, me neither, it'll be weird... But you'll see you'll visit them really soon... ...and they'll come here. You think without your mom this will be chaos, right? No, no. I have my room and I'd make it nice really quickly! The thing is... ...I'm worried about the kids without me... ...me without them... ...I don't know. It's going to be weird. I know I'm killing you, Dad. I spoke to Mom just now. I needed her opinion. She told me to stay with you as I had decided. Don't think she said anything to me. She's upset too. The thought of leaving makes me really sad too. I don't know what to do. -I think you should go, Aman. -Really? Totally. I was wrong... Staying would be crazy... ...not crazy, but... ...I didn't think this through. When you took charge of the whole scholarship process, I got on board. But I should have told you otherwise from the start. Maybe in the future, when you start high school. Your room will still be here when you visit or when you come back. But, Dad... ...you're going to be alone. How will you manage? I've always been alone... ...there's always a friend around. Actually I'm going to start a pretty intense job. I'll be working all day. And when you guys come I'll actually have money! What about the record store? We'll see. Maybe I'll close it and keep the records for myself. I'll finish primary school and then I'll come. High school's not that good there. OK. I'll start the paperwork when you are in 7th. -We'll see how it goes, OK? -OK. OK. Go pack your bag. -I'll order food. What do you want? -Whatever you guys are having. Dad... ...I'm leaving you the piano. Take care of it. It used to be mine before being yours. I do not want to make a blues I do not want to see the light I just want to be with you every morning and your awakening to be better in these tough times the sun can still rise among the clouds. To live a passion was not going to be easy in an instant everything turns different. But there is no pain that makes me forget what we both did in so many years. But no pain is strong enough to make me forget what we both did over so many years. No, let's see... But no pain is strong enough to make me forget what we both did over so many years.
