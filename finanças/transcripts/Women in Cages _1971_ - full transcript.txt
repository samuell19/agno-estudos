(smooth jazz music) (bar patrons conversing quietly) (uptempo jazz music) (boat engine revving) (spectators cheering and applauding) - Do you know, I still don't know what you do? - You might say I'm a player. (roosters squawking) - Come on, come on, don't give up! Keep fighting, come on, come on! - Hey, what's that for? - I don't know. Playing always excites me. Come on, come on! What are you doing? - You want to be a player? Hold this for me and don't tell anyone where you got it. I'll explain later. - Rudy! - You looking for your laundry, Acosta? - The girl. The girl has it. (dramatic uptempo music) (spectators cheering) (roosters squawking) - Rudy! Rudy! - Now, easy baby, easy. - I've been so scared, I don't know what's going on! - It's okay, it's okay. - And those men, they say-- - Shh. Let's sit down. Now listen. You've been great. - But they said they found heroin in my purse? Over 100,000-- - It was all a mistake. They're trying to frame me. Just remember, don't tell them anything. There's a reason. - All right, but I'm scared. - I know, I know. But trust me. Keep quiet and my lawyers will get you out. - Does the defendant have anything to say before the court delivers sentence? - No, your honor. - This court sentences you to 10 years hard labor. To be served at Carcel Del Infierno. (dramatic music) - Let's go. - Inside, quick. - Next. Your name? - Carol Jeffries. - [Alabama] Where you from? - California. - "California, matron." Whenever you pigs speak to the staff, you say matron. Understand? - Answer her back. - Say it! - Yes, matron. - Good. - Sign here. - This is going to be just like back home. Only different! Inside! - No weapons or drugs, Alabama. - [Alabama] All right. Let's get the lights off of 'em. - Okay, move! (prisoners screaming) (hose spraying) (dramatic music) (prisoners coughing) - You, in here. Hurry up. - My name is Theresa. - You're an American, aren't you? Call me Sandy. - I'm Jeff. - I'm Janelle Stokowski. - Call the pig Stoke. Drives her wild. - No one is using that bed. - What are you in for, Jeff? - I, uh... I don't... (Jeff sobbing) - [Sandy] Here honey, you'll make it. - What about the guard, the one in charge? Is she, is she American? - You mean Alabama, the chief matron? Yeah. She's American. - She hates just Americans? - No, but they're a special target. You want to watch out for the playpen. - Playpen? - [Alabama] Theresa. (Stoke shuddering) - Are you all right? - Don't touch me! Don't anybody touch me! (dramatic music) (Alabama laughing) - An appeal would be useless. There's too much attention on this case. - There must be someone we can reach. - Not now. Acosta's putting on too much heat. - The only way we can get out is to tell Acosta where she got the parcel. - That's too bad. She excited me. Jorge, I'll leave it to you. Find someone in the prison to kill her. - I know just the woman. - Stokowski. Visitor. - The sooner you kill her-- - [Stoke] I need a fix! - Listen to me, you-- - You started me on this garbage! I need it now! - Am I getting through to you? - Yeah, yeah. You want me to kill the Jeffries girl. - Do it right. And our lawyers will have you out in three months. - Sure. But what about my fix? (Stoke breathing heavily) - For her. For you. - Would you care for a sandwich? Go ahead and take it, I have another. - Thanks. - Mmhmm. (dramatic music) (Stoke shuddering) (birds chirping) (gasping) - [Jeff] Did he eat my sandwich? - Must be awfully hard to keep your hair neat with that big bitch running her fingers through it all the time. - Get off my back, Sandy. - Or do you take such a position that, uh, Alabama can't reach your head? (dramatic music) Come on, you little dyke. - I'm gonna cut your eyes out. - You wanna love me too? - Hey come on, stop it! - Come cut my face up. - Don't! - Come and get me. (Sandy laughing) Alabama digs me, not you. - I hate you! (Jeff screaming) - [Sandy] Jeff! Oh, Jeff! - [Stoke] Are you okay, Jeff? - What's going on here? - She said something. - What? - About... You and me. - Oh? Take her to the playpen. (dramatic music) Put her in the boots. - No! No! (guillotine clanging) - Strip her. (dramatic music) (rope creaking) There now, comfy? - What kind of game are you playing? - A real nice game. You will like it. - You can't scare me. - Can't I? (fire crackling) (breathing heavily) This is our version of the hot foot. (Sandy screaming) - [Guard] Hurry up. Hurry up! Come on. Get moving, hurry up. - Don't it make you pine for those cane fields in the south? Hit it, slut! Get moving! (dramatic music) Leave her there! Get back to work, everybody! (Sandy breathing heavily) - Are you feeling better? - [Sandy] Yeah, Alabama can't hurt me. - How can she get away with it? Why don't you report her? - Alabama has all the power. The warden doesn't care about anything except the money she can steal from here. - What about escape? - There's gonna be jungle for miles around here. - Besides, they hire trackers to hunt you down. - Trackers? - Bandits who know the jungle. - [Sandy] They don't care how they get you back. They get $50 whether you're dead or alive. - Hasn't anybody ever made it? - I never heard of anyone. (dramatic music) - [Guard] Here she is. - What are we celebrating? - It's five years since I left the States. - Oh. What do you know about the new American in my cell? - Nothing. Except she's typical of the racist bitches I knew back in the States. - I love you, Alabama. - Then massage my back, it aches. (dramatic music) - [Sandy] I've been good to you, haven't I? - You're good. So are others. Ow! So you want to play rough, huh? (whip snapping) (Sandy screaming) (Theresa screaming) (barrel clattering) (breathing shakily) - Are you feeling all right? - Yeah. That's a bitch if I ever saw one. Right? She and that big dyke sure must have gotten it on this time. - Leave me alone, you! - All right, ladies! The field hands eating well today? I asked a question, Theresa. - It's good. - "It's good, matron." - It's good, matron. - I like my friends to be happy. Isn't her hair beautiful, Theresa? Theresa? - Yes, matron. - Yes it is. She'll be a relief after your hysterics. - Why you! (prisoners screaming and shouting) (laughing) (Jeff screaming) (Theresa groaning) - Get up and go to work. Everybody! - [Guard] All right, move out! Hurry up! - I'll be all right. - Stick with it, kid. You've got eight years, five months, and 17 days to go. - How long have you been here? - Two years. - What did you do? - I killed a rotten son of a bitch. My husband. (breathing shakily) - Stokowski. You're not going to the fields today. - Sit down. - Why? - Since we're both Americans, I thought we should be friends. - Jeff and, uh, Sandy are Americans too. - Then maybe one day their time will come. - Theresa was your friend. - Theresa became too sure of our friendship. - Suppose I became too sure? - You'd wind up like Theresa. - Then I see no value in your friendship. (dramatic music) - It could postpone certain hazards. - Go to hell! - I'll send you ahead of me. Juana! We were just discussing hell. Perhaps we can show her a bit of home. (Alabama chuckling) Stop. (Stoke breathing heavily) I don't know why you're not enjoying yourself. I'm having fun. (spitting) (Stoke screaming) (Jeff gasping) (dramatic music) (gun firing) - Stop! (guns firing) - An escape in the fields! - [Guard] Hands up everybody, hurry up. All right, move. Hurry up. - You think they made it? - I hope so. - Oh, they will be caught. - Oh, God... - Celeste and Amelia, huh? - That's right, Superintendent. The two of them. The matron fired one round before they killed her. Shall we arrange for the trackers? (dramatic music) - [Sandy] Well, well, well. Did you have a good time? - Leave me alone, damn you! - I didn't know. (Stoke shuddering) - What'd they do to you? - That big dyke... She... She's got it out for me. I gotta get outta here. I gotta get outta here. - Look, maybe a good lawyer can help you. I mean, my friend Rudy, I mean, he knows a lot of smart ones and-- - If they're so smart, what are you doing in here? - They're working on an appeal now to get me out. - The only way out of here is the way those girls went. Through the jungle. - Oh sure, to be killed by animals or bandits. You have to really know the jungle to survive, Theresa. - I know the jungle. I was raised in a village 50 miles from here. - Would they help? - I don't know. Not to escape. But once I'm there... They might. (breathing shakily) - [Sandy] Who are you writing? - Well, it's not my mother. - And you think he'll write you back? - Yes. 'Cause he loves me. - Do you really think he's going to get you out? - Yes, if he can. - Well, has he written you? - Well... Not yet. - [Jerry] Hi, Sandy. - It's been a long time, Jerry. - Sorry, I'm on a hot case. - And my case has lost its heat, is that it? - I've been working that too. - Sure. You've uncovered new evidence, I suppose? - But I have. It turns out you could have killed your husband in self-defense. If we work it right, you'll get a new trial. - So all I have to do is write the judge I told you so? - There's a quicker way, if you're agreeable. You're in the same cell with the Jeffries girl, right? - What, do you want me to tuck her into bed? - Nothing that dramatic. Just make friends with her, gain her confidence, get her to testify against the syndicate. - [Sandy] Then what? - I can guarantee your pardon in three months. - Three months? (snake hissing) (dramatic music) (snake hissing) (Jeff screaming) - [Sandy] What happened? - [Jeff] There's a snake, it's crawling all over me! - There it is! (metal banging) - Oh! - What happened? - Oh, nothing. We just, uh, had a little visitor. - Here. You want it? (chuckling) - I could kill you for that! - Those dumb snakes. They're all over this place. - I don't know, but I'm beginning to feel a little paranoid. I mean at first, the rat and now, and now this? - Have you heard from Rudy? - Not a word. - Men are all bastards. - He's probably in bed with some slut right now. - No he's not. Or maybe they arrested him too. - For what, jaywalking? - So what are you gonna do now? - Wait, I guess. (somber organ music) - Theresa, gonna confess your sins today? - Yes, matron. - You better be careful now. God's punishment could be worse than mine. (priest speaking foreign language) - Lord Jesus Christ. Son of the living God-- - You, uh, you don't believe those lies Sandy said about me? Do you? - I don't think anything about it. - Well, she's lying. See, there was this boy when he was on tour here and-- - You don't have to explain to me. - But I want to. I want us to be friends. - This is the lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world. Happy are those who are called to His supper. - Anyway, he was arrested for armed robbery. And they called me an accomplice. - How could they do that? - I was a foreigner. No friends, no money. They used me as a scapegoat. - Something like that happened to me. (dramatic music) Theresa, I need your help. I'm going to escape. - What? - I mean, I think I, I mean, I know I'm sure that something has happened to Rudy. So when we yell snake, the matron will come over to kill it. - And I... (imitating knife slicing) - You know, the matrons are jumpy as cats now. You could get killed. - Maybe so. But you're welcome to come along if you'd like. - I don't like it. - [Guard] All right, that's enough, everybody. Get inside. - Well, think about it, because we're going to leave tomorrow. - [Juana] Out. Everybody out. - You're determined? What about Rudy? - I'm afraid I'm on my own. - [Juana] Hurry up. - Jeff. I'm with you. - [Juana] Break it up! (whistle blowing) - Attention everybody! I know this will be a disappointment to all of you, but you're not going to the fields today. Some dignitaries will be visiting us, and they want to take a look at you. Take them to the showers. (hose spraying) - Two showers in one week, what luxury. - [Stoke] This changes your plans a little, doesn't it? - Just today, that's all. We'll go tomorrow. - I hope there's some men among the visitors. - Good morning, warden. - Good morning. (Superintendent speaking foreign language) - They look human. - What do you expect, three heads? - Commandante? You are an American, aren't you? - Yes I am. - I thought so. - I spent many years in your country. I regret we meet under these circumstances. Is everything all right here? - The food? - Do you want an honest answer? - Why, certainly. - Well, the food is rotten. The women here are treated like animals. - Put her in the hole! - And there's a nightly torture by the head matron, who is nothing but a sadistic-- - Yes, yes, yes, yes. - So nice. - [Superintendent] Now, for the buildings. - Garcia. Put her in the hole. (Jeff gasping) (dramatic music) (Jeff screaming) - Let me out of here! Let me out of here! (coughing) (groaning) (Jeff sobbing) Little Miss Muffet sat on her tuffet, eating her curds and whey... Along came a spider and sat down beside her and frightened Miss Muffet away. Who's there? (sighing) Jack Sprat could eat no fat. His wife could eat no lean. Between them both... They wiped the platter clean. - How on earth could that girl be so stupid? - She'd believe anything anybody tells her. - And that could get her killed. - After yard break, maybe they'll let her out. - Yard break! Everybody up! (Jeff screaming) (dramatic music) (screaming) (sobbing) - Out! Looks like you don't like our little hole. - [Jeff] You tried to kill me with acid! - Somebody doesn't like you. But I like to watch my little games, as you'll soon find out. (Jeff screaming) (electronic warbling) (dramatic music) Well, acid-head, you were a tattletale, huh? - What kind of hell did you crawl out of? - It was called Harlem, baby. I learned to survive. Never have pity. This game is called survival. Let's see how well you can play it. (electricity crackling) (Jeff gasping) I was strung out behind smack at 10. And worked in the streets when I was 12. You've got a long way to go. - Is this how you get your kicks? (electricity crackling) (Jeff screaming) - She has stopped screaming. - She was too stupid to last long in this hellhole anyway. - That's a terrible thing to say. We were worried. What, uh, what happened? - I just want to sleep. - Well, I guess the escape is off. - No. I'm gonna go through with it. - Eyes front! (somber music) - No one escapes from my prison. No one! (horse neighing) - [Guard] Put them down. - These fine gentlemen... Have never let a prisoner elude them. Study them and think about it. Come with me and I'll give you your money. - Are you okay? - Celeste and Amelia are dead. - I-I saw. - I hope that takes care of any plans you had to escape. - Theresa? - Those are bad men. - I thought of something. The hole out in the yard, it connects to the sewage pipe outside the wall. - So what? - So, if we can get into the hole, we can make our escape from there. - Oh, beautiful. Suppose you go to the playpen instead? - Well, suppose we get into the hole without anybody knowing it. - And how do you propose to do that, Miss Know-it-all? - Just wait, just give me a second. I think I know how. (dramatic music) - Hey, Stoke. - Jeff! - This is it, baby. - [Jeff] Matron? - What do you want? - [Theresa] Matron, we would like to light a candle for Celeste and Amelia. - Do it on Sunday. - But their souls might be suffering in purgatory right now. - It'll only take five minutes. - All right, I'll light one with you. (Juana groaning) (dramatic music) - [Jeff] Give it! Wait for a signal. - What about her? - Just leave her there. Come on, let's go. - Theresa, give me a hand. (suspenseful music) - Juana! (soft clattering) Peekaboo. Come on outta there! - [Jeff] No, wait, no! We can use her as a hostage. (Alabama groaning) - How is it? - It's open. - Well, let's go. - [Theresa] I'll go first. Give me that. - I'm keeping the gun. - Okay, let's go. - [Sandy] Now you crawl, pig. (dramatic music) (water sloshing) (frogs croaking) (suspenseful music) (water sloshing) (siren blaring) (gun firing) (Alabama groaning) - [Stoke] Get up! - [Alabama] You'll have to carry me. - [Jeff] Don't! - [Sandy] Give it to her, Stoke. - Why not? A white man raped me, a white bitch can kill me! - All right, get up. (dramatic music) - [Sandy] Get up! Oh, she's not hurt, she's just faking it. Now get up! What is it, Theresa? - It's so dark. I can't find my way around. - [Jeff] Then why don't we stop here for the night? I mean, we must have had a good head start. - You going to shoot me? - [Stoke] We're leaving her here. Let's go. - No, wait a minute, she might come in handy. - Look, she'll die if we leave her here. - We'll all die if those trackers catch us. - [Jeff] Then maybe why don't we just let her go? - What? To tell them which way we went? Uh-uh. We should kill her. - I'll do it. - No you don't. I've got one killing on me and I don't want another one. - Look, she tried to kill me too. But I don't have to be like her. - All right. It's decided. We'll leave her here. But tie her up good. (dramatic music) (women breathing heavily) We can't stop now! - [Jeff] Which way, Theresa? - Beyond those twin peaks is a river, Puenta Verde. - [Stoke] Let's go! - They definitely came through here, sir. - What about the Tommy Gun? - No sign of it. - Then they're on their way to Sunwest Town. - Or the village of Puenta Verde. - Puenta Verde. That Tapek fellow, I think Stokowski used to be his mistress. - But the syndicate cut him off. - They still got one more man there. - Romero? - Let's go. (dramatic music) - You come back to free me or kill me? - [Theresa] To kill you, yes. But slowly. (Alabama groaning) - You tired already? - You are a devil. - We all have our devils, my dear. Now cut me loose. - [Tracker] Get her! (trackers laughing and shouting) (cloth ripping) (Theresa screaming) - Where's Theresa? Theresa! Theresa! - [Stoke] We haven't got time, come on! Sandy, come on! - [Tracker] Let's go for the other one. - Wait a minute. (coughing) - We don't know where the village is. - I do. And I know a fisherman there. They can get us aboard the Zulu Queen. - The Zulu Queen? - Rudy's ship? - Yeah. Let's go. (trackers laughing and shouting) (Alabama screaming) - [Sandy] Stoke, wait a second! Let's rest a while. Say, Stoke, how come you knew about this, uh, this fisherman? - My, my old man, we both worked for Diaz. - You never tod me you knew Rudy! - I worked for him. - You... Why didn't you ever tell me? - Nevermind. I'm helping you both get away aren't I? - Are you? - Let's keep moving. (animals calling) - Stoke, wait a minute. Let's wait for Theresa. - No we won't, move on. - I'm with her, you're out-voted. - Well this is with me, and it says we go now. I said move! (dramatic music) (waves crashing) - We made it. - [Sandy] Not quite. Where to now, big shot? Huh? - [Stoke] You two hide somewhere and wait. - [Sandy] Come on over here. Come on, Jeff. (dramatic music) - Who are you? - I... I was uh... I was Tapek's girl. You remember? - Yes, I do remember. I was very sorry when he was killed. - Forget it. Listen... I need a fix. - A fix? You mean-- - Yes. I... I've got, uh, two girls waiting outside. And I want $500 a piece for them. - That can easily be done. - One of them is Diaz's own girl, so he can do what he likes with her. - That Jeffries girl? - Yes. (breathing shakily) Now my fix. Give it to me. - I never had it. - But Jorge promised! He said he'd give it to me-- - I know, I know. He'll be waiting at the boat. - I don't like this. I've heard things about the Zulu Queen. - [Jeff] You keep saying that, what have you heard? - Shh. - [Man] Stokowski's waiting for you. Follow me, it's safe now. Hurry up. (dramatic music) I told you to stay down. You, stay there. - What's the score? - He's contacted one ship by radio. Jorge was-- - What about Rudy? - I don't know. (boat engine revving) - [Jorge] Get in everybody, hurry up. - [Stoke] Jorge, where is it? - [Jorge] You'll get it on the ship. Keep on moving. - [Jeff] Jorge, where's Rudy? - [Jorge] He has business in the city, but he'll meet you on the ship. Come on! - [Man] That one with long legs, she has a special relation to Rudy. I should get at least $1,000 for her, hmm? - [Jorge] You'll get something else if you don't shut up! - [Man] You won't dare. I'm the guy who delivers dolls to that floating whorehouse of yours, remember, hmm? - [Jorge] Give it to him, Rico. (Jorge laughing) (man groaning) - [Jorge] Get her, hurry up! (dramatic music) (water sloshing) (gun firing) (boat engine revving) (guns firing) - [Sandy] And that's when I ran into you. - [Man] Thank you, Miss Granger. I'm sure we'll be able to have your case reopened. - Here, put this on. - Thank you. I hope it's not too late for me. - What about Jeffries? Do you think she will testify now? - Jeff? I... I don't know. (upbeat jazz music) (bar patrons laughing and conversing) - [Jeff] Rudy! - Baby. - You made it! - You know what I came here for. - Jorge, give her all the trips she needs. - She'll get it. - Rudy, can we get outta here? - We'll take your ship that comes by so we can get aboard. - You are not getting aboard on a ship, my dear, but this one. - What are you talking about? But you can't do that. We made a deal! (gasping) - Our deal was to kill her, but you didn't. (Stoke breathing heavily) - You bastard! You mean I trusted you and you've been using me? Rudy! Rudy! - And you can trust that we can use you again. - Rudy? - Take her to the back and give her a lesson. - Rudy! - [Jorge] Get in. Give her a shot. Take it off. This is called on the job training. - If Jeffries comes ashore and testifies, that will be legal, wouldn't it? - What do you think, Luca? - That's right, Major. - And if we go aboard unofficially? That would be legal too, wouldn't it? - I guess so. - So if we just happened to escort the cooperative Miss Jeffries ashore, there can be no complaints, can there? - No, sir. - Good, you just volunteered for a night out. (boat engine revving) (uptempo rock music) - There she is. - [Man] We have a visitor. - You don't remember me. - Of course I do. We had a great time, you were very good. - I'm Captain Acosta. Try to remember. I'm Captain Acosta. I want you to testify against Diaz. - Oh! - Look, I want to help you. I want to get you off the ship. - You can't, they watch us too closely. - We can at least try, come on! Come on! - Acosta, this way! (suspenseful music) - Where is Jeff? - Number three, senor. - [Quinn] Sir, let's get moving. (guns firing) - Take her with you. When you get on deck above, my men will get you. Now, go! (guns firing) (bar patrons conversing excitedly) (suspenseful music) (guns firing) (boat engine revving) - Jump! Come on! (water splashing) - It's all over. Get the girls back to work. (dramatic music)
