(singing in foreign language) (dog barking) (guns firing) (splashing) (squawking) - It's bad luck to kill a bat. - No, not this one. It's a vampire. The kind that sucks cow's blood. Eh. Run. (tense music) (bird squawking) (boat motor revving) - [Man] In reply to your letter, you must know that I have dedicated my whole life to the study of Nosferatu. From his earliest origins in Transylvania 10 centuries ago to his mysterious disappearance in Venice during the carnival of 1786 when the plague decimated the city's inhabitants. (man chanting in foreign language) (bell ringing) (women sobbing) Nosferatu is a supreme lord of evil second only to the devil himself. To my knowledge, his supernatural powers have defeated all attempts to kill him. In fact in the language of his roots, his very name means "he who is undead". And yet I am convinced that death is what he most desires. Whatever you have in mind concerning this maleficent being, I urge you to await my arrival. Your house has indeed been the site of terrible events now mercifully buried by the dust of time. (door creaking) - Good morning, sir. (light music) - We have a guest. Do you know him? - No. I know who he is and why he is here. He has come to destroy the precarious peace that reigns this house. - I'll tell the princess you are here, sir. The princess apologizes for not coming down. She will receive you in her room, sir. - I am grateful to you for accepting my invitation so promptly. - It was the least I could do. - What did you think of my letter? - I'm afraid it was too vague for me to form an opinion. - If that were true, you wouldn't be here. - I expect to die quite soon. - Hematophagusology is the scientific study of a psychological affliction also known as thirst for blood. - The study of vampirism. Professor Catalano is the world's leading authority on the subject. - Vampirism? Sounds like something you call the vet for. - The study of the phenomenon merely requires the entire span of man's knowledge. - Graces. - [Princess] Good evening, Gran. - What is the Church's attitude towards vampires? - Well vampirism is one of the thousand ways in which evil manifests itself. It was Pope Benedict XIV who decreed that. - Did your search for vampires bring you to Venice? - Vampires are everywhere. - Wonderful dinner. - Good night. - Thank you for coming, good night. - Good night! - Why did you say you expect to die soon? - Because it's true. And I have little time for social pleasantries. - Come with me. There's something you must see. Dr. Barnabo and his wife are old friends of the family. I'm sure he didn't mean to be rude. He's so damnedable. He can't accept what he doesn't understand. - Yes, very common attitude, I'm afraid. (tense music) - We're 30 feet below the level of the Grand Canal. This crypt dates back to the 16th century when the Canins family settled in this. Originally we're from Transylvania. (hooves rumbling) Many of my ancestors are buried down here. Why does this one have these iron bands? Have you ever seen a tomb like this? (tense music) (booming) (eerie groaning) - Simply eaten away by rust, that's all. The others, all in very good condition. - According to an old family legend a vampire was buried alive in this tomb. I'm convinced it was Nosferatu. - No. He left Venice 200 years ago. - During the plague. Yes I know that legend too. But as far as I'm concerned, he never left at all. I want to open this tomb and free my house of the nightmare. - Princess, I would advise against that. - That's why I invited you. What consequences can be expected to set him free? - A reaction so monstrous that it would be beyond all imagination. Be assured, it is not he that's in there. The truth is he was shipwrecked on the bay of Biscayne. It's quite safe to assume that it's the seabed where he found his final resting place. - I'm sure you don't believe that. Since you advise against opening the tomb, I will prove my theory in another way. I know someone who can look back through the darkness of time and contact the spirits of the dead. (light suspenseful music) (whacking) (giggling) - Put me down! - [Crowd] Good morning, Graces. - Aren't you Gianmarco Trozatti? - Yes, Princess. - You are Laviere's friend, I believe. - Me, no! - You little shit! (laughing) - So you don't have a girlfriend. Traitor. (laughing) - What are you looking for? - That portrait. Why did you have it taken down before I arrived? - Terrible events happened in this house 200 years ago. - Yes, I know. And the woman in the portrait was desperately involved. - Involved in what? I'm afraid I don't follow you. - Princess, if there's something you're hiding you must tell me at once, I haven't much time. - Help me up. (birds cawing in distance) My cane please. I vowed never to reveal the curse that weighs on this family. But you give me no choice. We left Transylvania to escape a terrible destiny but in vain. - Utarefson? What does it mean? I don't know of such a word. - [Paris] Nosferatu. (ominous music) (growling) (woman moaning) (speaking in foreign language) - Latin is the holy language. It should not be used by the enemies of God. (speaking in foreign language) - The abomination appeared 1786. And that year of our Lord, an unprecedented tragedy took place in this house between these very walls. (chanting in foreign language) - Vile being! I uphold upon you the will of Almighty God! Creature of evil! In the name of the crucified Christ, I order you to submit to the absolute authority of God and leave this house! In the name of the father, the son and the holy ghost! I annihilate you! (banging) Incarnation of inequity! May you plunge into the bottomless abyss for all eternity! (wind howling) (screaming) (crashing) (choking) - It was then that Nosferatu left Venice and no trace of him has ever been found. The fate of the princess in the painting is also unknown. - The Church gives no weight to legend or local superstition. - If you ask me, the book was the fruit of someone's imagination and inspired the painting. That's no proof. - If the story's true then Leticia was a vampire. - The doors of this house have always been open to him. If he hasn't already returned he no doubt will. (tense music) - We should not commit this blasphemy. - [Gran] Devil has laid his hands on this house. - I feel I must warn you that a seance like this can provoke reactions of quite terrifying proportions. - Oh come on professor. This is just harmless home entertainment. Nobody's forcing you to take part. - I've always wondered how people can become vampires. I mean are they born that way? - How do you become a vampire? By being the illegitimate sons of illegitimate parents, the son of witchers and warlocks, a man who takes his own life, those who die by hanging, those who die of the plague, those who die with blasphemy on their lips, murderers who die unpunished. And... The descendants of vampires. - Take your places. The priest must leave. - The Church forbids spiritualistic seances. - Form the circle. - The Church forbids spiritualistic seances! - The priest must leave. I must have absolute concentration. Whatever happens, do not break the circle. Nosferatu. Reveal yourself to us. Champion of evil! Manifestation of inequity. Shunned by death itself. (praying in foreign language) I am evoking you. (tense music) - What's happening? (exhaling) (heartbeat pulsing) - Nosferatu, reveal yourself to us! Foul spawn. Depravity personified. High priest of putridity. Enemy of Christ. Adversary of life. Abomination of abominations. (intense music) (tense music) - Come. My prince. Come, my lord. I am calling you. I am calling you. Come to me. Come, come to me. Come to me. Come to me. Come. Come, my lord. I am calling you. Come to me. (hissing) (squishing) (gasping) - Helietta! (groaning) Don't shock her. Helietta. - Open the curtains. Now doctor, she'll be all right. You come with me, I'm gonna need your help. - What do you expect to find down there? Nothing. I'm going back upstairs. - [Woman] Come. My prince. Come my lord. (tense music) My prince. Come home. I am calling. Come to me. (waves crashing) (clapping in distance) (upbeat guitar music) (singing in foreign language) (tense music) - [Woman] Come, do not be afraid, child. This is the man who will make you immortal. - I am ready my Lord. - My liege. - Who summoned me? - Someone who lives far away has summoned you. - You're mistaken, that's a scene from the past. (chanting in foreign language) (clapping) (dramatic music) (Spanish guitar music) - Oh my lord, my people are nothing without you. - Your people are free, I'm leaving. - No, after 200 years, you cannot leave. - Time has no meaning in a life that never ends. (women wailing) (light music) (birds squawking) (booming and whistling) (crowd chattering) (booming) (gong sounding) (ominous music) - What if he be made of something that was there? - [Woman] Why didn't you take me with you, my prince? You left me here. And so condemned me to the most horrible death. Life without you. - Helietta! Helietta! - [Woman] I beg you. I beseech you. (tense music) (whimpering) (praying in foreign language) (screaming) (ominous music) (groaning) (man speaking in foreign language) - It was Nosferatu, wasn't it? - Yes. We summoned him, he answered and he will kill again. - What can we do? - Love is the only antidote for evil. Only love can kill him now. - Love? - Yes. The love of a consenting virgin. The love of an innocent. The very moment he possesses her, nigh, something he has sought for a thousand years. - Who could love a creature like that? Please don't let it be her. - Princess. Princess. The time has come. We must find out who is buried in that tomb. (light music) - [Woman] All the Canins women were destined to meet a violent death or be carried off by Nosferatu. (buzzing) - Let's all lift together. (speaking in foreign language) (chains clinking) It's all right my love. Everything can be explained. The total absence of air prevented the body from decomposing. After we opened the tomb, she should turn to dust. It's a known phenomenon. - Mercury. The soul of all metal. The only natural element capable of killing a vampire. The victim must have been forced to drink it before she was pierced through the heart. (birds squawking) (light music) (festive music) - You're right, I haven't been with strangers. But tonight I'm not gonna let it bother me. I promise. - Are you happy? When are we getting rid of that Englishman? - When are you getting rid of your wife? (tense music) - What is it? Don't you feel well? - Suddenly, I feel ice cold. - Come on, I'll take you home. (crowd laughing and giggling) - [Helietta] Excuse me, I... - Helietta! Helietta! Helietta! (Spanish guitar music) (festive music) (tense dramatic music) (Spanish guitar music) (tense music) (light music) (speaking in foreign language) - Are you talking to me? I don't understand what you're saying but it sounds wonderful. - It's a old language which doesn't exist anymore. It's the word of the dead. - The words sound so beautiful. What do they mean? - It means I feel my love. I crossed rivers. I climbed mountains. I traversed the skies to be with you. Because you called me. - It wasn't me. But I was expecting you. Oh my prince. - Your place is not here. Let me take you away. (woman moaning) (intense music) - He was here. He came for me. - 120/90, that's normal. The wounds are superficial. - You're making a great mistake in your diagnosis, using a measure of normal behavior. - Look, I'm a doctor. It's the only measure I know. - All he's done so far is to stimulate her senses. No. He's preparing the ground. His next move. He intends to take her with him. A macabre journey that's destined never to end. (horns tooting in distance) That's something I will not allow. (barking) (growling) (intense music) (hooves rumbling) (tense music) (horn sounding) - Oh my god. Help, help! (growling) Help! (screaming) (squeaking) (dog barking in distance) (eerie music) - The dog has stopped barking. - The magazine holds five 45 caliber shells. It can stop a charging rhinoceros. The muzzle velocity is incredible. What's the matter? - Shh. (tense music) He's out there. Listen. (wind howling) (clinking) (door clacking) Here he comes. (gate creaking) (dinging) (crashing) (gun clacking) (gun firing) (gun firing) (ominous music) - Back! Back! Bestial creature. You've known ever since Satan belched you forth those many hundred years ago, that you've been excluded from nature's scheme. Life has refused you. Death has refused you. The just reject you. Even the unjust. There's no place for you here on earth or elsewhere that will welcome you. The very essence of life rejects you. Now in the name of all God's angels I order you, stand back! In the name of Jesus Christ, begone! Vile abomination. By the power of the cross will crush you. (chanting in foreign language) - Here I am, my lord. (ominous music) - Back! Back. (hissing) (screaming) (light music) - [Maria] Don't go with him, Helietta! (dogs barking) (dog howling) (bell tolling) - [Paris] Love is the antidote for evil. Only love can kill him now. The love of a consenting virgin. The love of an innocent. The very moment he possesses her, he will die. Something he has sought for a thousand years. (wings flapping) - If you don't need your life, others can use it. Now you belong to me. I am your master. (inspiring music) (dogs barking in distance) (light music) (birds cawing) - You are leaving, I take it. - Yes. I failed. I've been defeated. And rightfully so. - That filthy devil. - The demon of death is opposed to anything which isn't light. - Where did he take her? Doesn't he ever have to sleep, for God's sake? - He sleeps 24 hours every 24 days. Every clod of earth which his coffin lies has known nothing but human suffering, sickness, misfortune. - Must be a dozen places like that here. - He travels always with his own patch of cursed land. He's lulled to sleep by the cries of the dead. - Man and woman were carried away to that island. It's where they endured a thousand tortures of the flesh and the spirit. Their screams could be heard as far away as Chioggia and Pellestrina. Then in the course of time the living turned to corpses. The corpses turned to dust. And that place became the Lazaretto. The city's haven for its plague victim. - Of course, the plague cemetery. It's out on the dog island. That's a perfect place for him. There is nothing but death out there. They turned part of it to a crematorium for cholera victims. - How ironic. What a waste. To think that the end of one's life's work to discover the arrogance of opposing evil in one's own way. It's perhaps contrary to the universal scheme of God. And what's to become of you, Father? - Oh. My place is here in this house. I am the guardian of wandering souls. I am the defender of suffering spirits. The great dragon, that ageless serpent called Satan seeks to corrupt every corner of the civilized world. Humanity must fight to save itself. Every man knows the temptation of his own lust! Only God almighty is not a temptor. Nor tempted. I'm the guardian of wandering souls. I am the soldier of the truth. You set yourself on a level with God? And he has punished you! You know nothing! You know nothing! You're proud! And you live in the front! You think you have knowledge! And you don't! You know nothing! You know nothing! (splashing) (light piano music) (light airy music) - Have you saved my life because you want to take it with your own hands? - I saved your life so you can help me die. - That's what you want most, isn't it? - I want to die if you wish. - That's what I want most. To give you death. (motor revving) (light music) Doesn't the daylight frighten you? - It's the night that frightens me. (intense music) (dogs barking in distance) (moaning) - This'll stop the bastard. (tense music) - [Man] What's this place? - The plague cemetery. They used to throw them in here alive. (eerie music) Take them. If Catalan was right, this must be the cursed land he sleeps on. Let's open them. The gypsy girl at the costume ball. This one. Helietta. Helietta. What has he done to you, my darling? Breathe. She is breathing. (gasping) This is our chance. The bastard's asleep. We drive a stake through him. Pin his heart to the floor. Hold it steady. (screaming) (speaking in foreign language) That user! He made me kill her! - [Man] Let's get out of here. - Quick, find him. Try to kill him, where is he? (moaning) (intense dramatic music) (Maria moaning loudly) - And now my life may be yours. - Wait, please wait. Keep your life a little longer. Don't leave me now. - I have waited so long and now I'm afraid to die. (gun booming) (snarling) - Run, for Christ's sake! (tense music) Run! (dogs barking in distance) Helietta! (light music) Helietta! Helietta, wait! Helietta, I've come to take you home. You look so pale. What's he done to you? - I'm happy now that you're here. Come. Kiss me. (screaming) (growling) (dogs barking in distance) (somber music) - Please. Don't let me die. - I don't have the power. - Yes you do. You could take me with you. - That's worse than death. - It's what I want. - No. - I want to stay with you for all eternity. If you can't die, I won't either. Live any way you want. (haunting organ music) - [Woman] It's bad luck to kill a bat. - [Man] Nah, not this one. It's a vampire. (choir music in foreign language)
