A mother is a town that only a child knows. A mother is a window that only a child can open. A mother is blank verse that only a child can make rhyme. A mother is a mystery that only a child can solve. A mother is water that only a child drinks. A mother is a lie that can only deceive a child. A mother is a song that only a child sings. A mother is a bed where only a child sleeps. A mother is a voice that only a child hears. A mother is a journey on which only a child can be sent. A mother is a question a child is the answer. But if the question is too long, the mother must answer it herself. A mother is a wall that only protects a child. A mother is a town that only a child knows. A mother is darkness through which only a child can pass. A mother is a tear that only a child can wipe away. "Mama." No matter how young she is, a mother must answer questions. My child is finally beginning to open its new eyes to the world, and to its endless "why". "Why do pigeons fly on Sundays too?" "Why do you put jam on bread?" "Why does the man have bad luck?" "Why is the hair floating in the soup?" "Why won't the Pope meet with France anymore?" "Why does the river flow into the sea?" "Why don't buses have a chimney?" "Why do people... kill people?" A mother thinks... about the day when her child will no longer ask "why". "Life has its course." "The day my child leaves..." "That day on the table in front of me" "a slice of bread will be left behind." "Like the beginning of a long, long Sunday." "The Monday of my life." "The Tuesday of my life." "The Wednesday of my life." "The Thursday of my life." "The Friday of my life." "The Saturday of my life." "The Sunday of my life." "In a corner of my heart there was always a cradle." "Since I was a virgin, in a dark hammock," "I have made preparations for my child who will someday be born." "But then... I think..." "A hand that has never killed a market pigeon" "probably won't be able to raise one either." "Eyes that have never stared death in the face," "how could they watch over a life?" A mother is a tear that only a child can wipe away. A mother is a town that only a child knows. People have used the lark in the wheat field as a lullaby. People have used the sound of the waves as a lullaby. People have used the roar of the subway on Sunday as a lullaby. People have used old piano music as a lullaby. But here people have used the sound of bombing as a lullaby. A child asks its mother, "What's heavier, me or the bomb?" The mother replies, "The bomb is heavier now," "but when you get bigger, you will get heavier." In a sunny wheat field, the mother thinks of her child getting gradually heavier. Eventually, the child will ask, "What's heavier, me or the Earth?" A mother is a grave that only a child visits. A mother is a song that only a child can remember. A mother is blank verse that only a child can make rhyme. A mother is a demon that only chases after a child. A mother is a wall that only protects a child. A prayer to the Sun in endless repetition. A prayer to the Sun in endless repetition. In Africa there are several languages. The word for "freedom" is "rusununguko" in Shona, "tokoloho" in Sotho, and "efu" in Igbo. But there is only one word for "mother": "Mama". A palm tree makes the stars in the sky its gods. It makes the swell of the sea its lullaby. It makes the entire countryside its mother. Dear Son, You can see your place in the world. "Mama." A mother had a mother. That mother had a mother. That mother had a mother. And that mother had a mother as well. And before that, there was her mother. A mother is a book that only a child can read. A mother is blank verse that only a child can make rhyme. A mother is a window that only a child can open. A mother is water that only a child drinks. A mother is a mystery that only a child can solve. A mother is a town that only a child knows. Every wonderful life ends in death. But even if a mother dies, and her child dies, and the child of that child dies, the sea won't die. A child asks its mother, "Is there anything beyond the horizon?" The mother laughs and doesn't answer. Then the child gets frustrated. And beyond the horizon it will probably imagine the promised land. The night that I thought about love. A mother is a sea in which only a child is allowed to swim. A mother is a tear that only a child can wipe away. And a mother is a country. A promised land not just for a child, but for all.
