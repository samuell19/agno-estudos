Once upon a time, not so long ago, there was a little village called Kromer. ln the woods nearby lived Gabriel. This is Seth. He's just arrived in the area. What do you think you're doing? -What? You've got to be careful. You're a wolf. l've just seen the priest. Oh. ls it time, Mrs Drax? He was cooking sausages. Oh, Mrs Drax we know that's not true. He'll be safely tucked up in bed. What happened? Nightmares. lt won't be long now. -Tonight? Yes, l gave her all of it. -l hope it was enough. lt must be. Her breathing's going, you can always tell by the breathing. l'm going to call the family. -Oh, then l can call Father David. No you won't. That's my duty. l'll call him (phone ringing) Hello?... lt's for you. lt's Fanny. -What time is it?... Hello Mum! Who is it? -Sh! lt's Fanny Alright Fanny. No, you did the right thing. We're on our way now. We'll be there as soon as we can. Good evening Doreen -Good evening Father. lt's good of you to be keeping Fanny company -Oh, l always come here on Saturday Father. She's looking ever so poorly. She's through there. Thank you Doreen, l'll show Father David where to go. We moved her downstairs. Makes it easier. Oaught you! Did you see him? He could hardly take his eyes off me. Only 'cos you remind him of his grandmother. -Do not. You do. He told me so himself. Took me aside ever so gently, squeezing my shoulder with his fingers as he did and all. 'Took you aside,' my foot. The only time your wizened old frame gets any touching up from him is when you stick it under his nose at Oommunion. Ooh, he makes me tremble when he puts that wafer in me mouth l bit his fingers one time. -You never -l did. Overcome by excitement. His young flesh. -There's a man. Father David. Did l tell you l saw a wolf earlier. -Ooh, you never. Snarled at me, he did. -You want to watch out Mrs Peach has been ever so poorly. Reckon one of them nipped her in her sleep. Nasty diseases. Where are we going? Almost there. Voila. What? -Home sweet home. Seth, here. -Thanks. Oheers. crash here if you want till you find your feet. There's a spare sleeping bag. -Great. Oh, you have come quick. -How is she, Fanny? l don't know, to be honest. Father David's been in with her for quite a while now. l wonder if l should take the children in. -Oh, l don't think so, they'd be far too upset. She's a remarkable woman. The Lord has given her great inner strength. She's sitting up in bed. -Sitting up and dead? Dear me, no. She's alive. Who's for hot chocolate? Father? l'm so sorry for phoning you so late Mr Drax, but Doreen heard her calling all your names. No, no. lt's fine. You did the right thing. She wanted her family round her. lt is so good to see a family gathering round at a time like this. With your love and support l can see her living to a hundred. Do you want something to eat? l've got some sandwiches. Are you sure that sandwich is big enough? l get hungry. You don't think l'm fat do you? Well... no, Did you nick it? l got it from the fridge. Whose fridge? -Mum's You should call them, let them know you're still alive. l left them a letter? -What did it say? Don't bother looking for me. l'm not coming back. Nice to leave on a positive note. l thought l'd never get a smile out of you. They were bastards. Do you get on well with your mum and dad? l never knew them. l'm sorry. What happened with yours anyway? -They found out. Surely they knew. Parents can always tell when their kids're going to turn out to be wolves They'd always suspected. Mum used to tell me to tuck my tail into my jeans, Dad used to make jokes about boys like me. But it was like they just hoped it would go away What happened? -lt was a full moon. -Ar-rooo. l just couldn't help myself, l'd locked the door but they burst in and found me in my glory; fur, tails, claws, the lot. l was holding a copy of 'Wolf Weekly.' What did they say? -Dad laughed. Mum just sat down and cried. And then? Here l am. Yeah, here we are. Well, l must say good night. And don't hesitate to call me if you need me before then. Time for bed young man. Goodnight Fanny goodnight Doreen. Doreen-goodnight Mrs Drax. And thank you Fanny. Hussey! That's what she is. Swanning around, handing out my cocoa like it's her own. And you, you're no better. You've bungled it. And now the family is here and all. Well you were the one that called them. You were the one who was so sure. Don't worry. Me and Miss Puss will think of something. You'll have to be careful 'cause that nice Mrs Drax'll be looking after her from now on. lf you hadn't been so stingy we wouldn't need no more. Now l need one more dose and l want it tomorrow. l can't keep this up much longer Fanny. l'm beginning to feel ever so peculiar. Go home. And don't come back without it. Sending my old bones out into the cold night. lf you moan as much as this when it's over, you know who'll be next for the chop? Yes l do Fanny. And you know Fanny, l can see Ms Puss and myself, just the two of us, getting on rather well in your cottage. Night night, Mind the pond. Wouldn't want to find you face down, bloated and white tomorrow morning, would we? What are you doing in my place? l'm not dead yet. l've told you, you shouldn't be out of bed. Darling Kester. -Morning Gran. Jeepers Oreepers... Now, go and get my handbag. l have to give you your Saturday money. But it's Sunday... thanks Gran. Now will someone pour me some coffee? And where's that pretty Polly. She isn't up yet. The pot's cold. l'll go and make some fresh coffee. You should put it back on the hot plate Mary lt keeps it warm. That's what l told her, Mrs Drax. Mother, you needn't think you're coming to church in your condition. You fuss too much. Now, where are my kippers? when Jesus said ''And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off and cast it from thee'' He doesn't mean really cut it off. He just means that you should avoid doing bad things with it in the first place. He was merely using violent imagery to emphasies the wickedness of sin. May l just add that today, to help us celebrate this beautiful Sunday morning, Fanny and Doreen have kindly provided us with coffee and cakes and since it is such a lovely day, l thought we might have them outside. So now if we all stand to sing hymn 31 1 . Good morning Fanny, you're looking bright after last night. -Oh thank you Father. it's the walks that do it. Good mile a day. Stops you from getting clogged up ls what my mother used to say. Oan l have a quite word. -Yes of course. Why don't you start serving coffee and l'll be with you in a moment. Good morning Bob, -Sure is preacher. Darn fine day for churching. Ah, Mrs Biffen. Now l told you before that Parsnip isn't allowed into church on Sundays. And why not? -Well he's a dog. Dogs have souls. Parsnip can go to heaven, can't you Parsnip? Yes. Yes, Mrs Biffen, but dogs go to dog heaven and they worship in dog churches. l've never heard such nonsense. Ah Mrs Drax. l didn't expect to see you. And why not? l've never felt better. Except for this bloody wheelchair. Gabs... Gabs... Gabriel. Dad. Have you heard what those people are saying about the wolves? l don't think they come this far inland, Kester. They're coming to get us. Prowling in from the coast. My wife saw them and all. Howling all night they were. Wolves? -Aye!. What? --Wolves? Here? --No! Doreen says she saw one. Howling and whining at night. l once shot a wolf in lndia, you know. lt didn't used to be like this. Mrs Drax: We're being left behind. Father, can l have that word now? Yes of course, what is it? -lts about lunch. You haven't forgotten have you? -Er... no, of course not. l'm doing the pudding Father. -Oh, don't tell me what it is, keep it as a surprise. lt's rhubarb crumble. Oome on, let's get breakfast. What's this? -Watership Down. You're not going to eat a rabbit? -l'll cook it first. l like muesli for breakfast. -Ouch! ... Sod it. Oome on Let's go. -Which way? That way. -But why can't we go to the lake? We can. -ls that a short cut? People'll see us -So what? So we take the long cut. -But l'm proud to be a wolf. Oh, that's just great, Seth. Fanny. Fanny. -What is it? She looks better than ever. lsn't it lucky Miss Puss and l've worked out something else then? Olever cat. What? -We'll blame it on the wolves. -Eh...? God it's cold. 10 green bottles. Duck! They're not shooting at us. They're probably just practising to shoot rabbits. Like that woman yesterday thought you were a rabbit. Oome on. You see, you don't pull the trigger, you squeeze it, real gentle, like a woman's titty. Here -What? Guess what's in my paw. -l don't know. Yours lt feels strange. -What? l don't know... l mean l'm not really sure. -What? l don't know. -Of course you know, you were just about to say it. l'm not completely sure if l'm really a wolf -lt's obvious to me lt's not you we're talking about, is it? -Oh, take a look in the mirror, Seth. You don't know anything about me. -You said you'd done it before. Fuck off! Look l'm sorry. Oome on, let's go to the lake. l'm glad you're here, Master Mark. And you Father. lt's your mother. That's what l wanted to have a word with you about. We've got to protect her. Protect her? Ooh it's awful, it's terrible and each she does it all by herself. And every time we find her further and further from the house. What does she do all by herself? She's taken to going for walks in her wheelchair. But l thought she'd been virtually bed-ridden recently. Yes, well she has, but then l found her one morning with just the thinnest little nightie to keep her from the elements. Just the flimsiest little piece of cotton, blowing in the morning breeze. She could've caught her death. We got to her in the nick of time, fortunately. Doreen made her something to warm her up. Yes l did. Just something to keep the chill out. Well, she is very lucky to have two such caring people to keep an eye on her. But what if it happens again? And what with all this talk about wolves. l've tried telling her about it the next morning, but she doesn't remember anything. She must be sleep walking. But l'm not sure that wolves have a taste for mature ladies, Fanny. You needn't worry. As she's been so bad Mary will stay on for a couple of days to help you look after her. l've got to go back this afternoon. What do you mean, ''Mary will stay on for a couple of days.''? l know, l know. But l did tell you. What about my work? l've have commitments too you know. You can be nurse down here instead. Why don't you bring your work here? You've a telephone and a laptop. l have to be on the spot. lt's unprofessional otherwise. You'll have the children to keep you company. Polly loathes it here. And me at the moment. lt'll be good for her revision. She's is getting no work done at home. And Kester won't mind missing a couple of days school. l'll get lonely. lt's so creepy here. - You'll be fine. Okay, but don't expect sex the moment you get back. Gabriel: Ouch! Damn it! Seth: Yeah. lt's cool. Andre. Andre! ...Andre? Or is it Gabriel now? -What do you want Michael? lt's good to see you. You've changed your hair. lt's nice. Who's this? Seth, this is Michael. Michael, Seth. -Hi Seth. Haven't seen around before. So are you two like... together? -Michael You know back in the old days he used to be known as Nelson. Nelson? -You know, the column Michael, it's good to see old friends and everything but we've got to make a move You should be careful though. lt's dangerous wandering away from the lake. Stick with the pack. Don't want you cuties peppered with shots now. -Mike, if you don't Not at all. Listen, there's a beach party tomorrow. A barbecue by the lake. Bring some beer and lover boy here. -Yeah, whatever. Why did he call you Andre? lt was just a stage name. He seemed to know you quite well. -Yup. And why was he so scared? lt's like you're ashamed. l'm not ashamed. Sunday afternoon by the lake and that's as far as it gets. (Ohurch bells ringing) Father. Why did our Lord ever create creatures such as wolves? There were no wolves in the Garden of Eden, Fanny. But l just hope... That's okay, thank you Mr Siegfried. Siegfried: Just two more minutes, Father. Hope what, Father? Well, l just hope they don't try and settle. They only bring disease and spread trouble wherever they go. They're unpleasant creatures. We should all keep an eye out. Just in case. -But there's no need to worry, Fanny. lsn't there? lt's not the first time l've had to deal with these sort of creatures. Excuse me. Are there games here? You know, arcade games. You see. He was fine. -Yeah, but you need money for games. Ok, now get ready. -What do you mean? l'm not doing this on my own. What if she puts up a fight? She'll expect me to bite her. Just have to growl man, show your teeth. -She might show hers. l'm not doing this. Nah, it's fine. You're a wolf. She'll be petrified. Grab the bag while she's getting the baby out of the way. -You do it. You're better at it than me. Just shut it or you'll get us caught. Don't touch my baby. l'll give you anything you want ... here, take my wedding ring. -Thank you. They must be close. Oan l take the gun, Father? -Not yet, Kester. But you said l'd get some target practice You will, young man, you will. Now we can play games. lnfected fuckers. So did you sleep with Michael? Look man, when two people get close, they sometimes allow themselves to have sex. So you were close? -Twice Damn! -Oh come on, it was just a 2 night stand. And l haven't seen him since then. ok? -So it was just sex? --Yeah So what am l then? -What do you want to be Seth? We've just witnessed a robbery, a woman and a child, and someone stole her handbag. You didn't see anyone did you? Oi! Oome on! ...Oome On! More cartridges Kester. l've got some in my pocket. Pussy loves you. Pussy wants her mummy to stroke her. Meow. meow. Oome on Pussy. l think we've done enough for tonight. Where are we going to go, eh? l don't see why l have to stay here if Dad doesn't have to. He's working very hard Polly. -l'm not eating this filth. lt even makes your cooking seem acceptable. -Oh, thank you. l've left a plate of food covered in the Aga for Master Kester. You've had enough. And you haven't? -Pas Devant... l think Fanny's quite capable of realising you've had too much to drink without me pointing it out. There's a nice helping of syrup sponge. That used to be your favourite Miss Polly. Yeah, well that was in the days when you could see what you were making. Polly, apologise to Fanny immediately. Good night Fanny. Sorry, Fanny. Sleep well, Fanny. -Good night, Miss. Oh, l am sorry Fanny. That's all right Mrs Drax. You can see which side of the family she gets it from. l'm frightened. Thanks for supper, Father. -Thank you for helping, Kester. l hope it wasn't too frightening. -No, it was great. Bye. Mum! ...Mum! Meeow. Hurry along Fanny, and let me in. lt's cold outside and l want my food... Meeow, you're keeping me waiting. l shall let your mistress hear of this. ... Oh no. She'd be ever so angry. ... You must let me help you Fanny. l've seen the way she's treated you through the years. ... You must take what is rightfully yours. Miss Puss, you are naughty. ... Oh, all right, l'm coming. Aaargh. ... What are you doing creeping up on me like that? Well you told me to come didn't you? All that noise. What you trying to do? Wake her up, or what? Did you bring the insulin? l brought the insulin. What about the scar, won't they notice? Not where l put it, beneath the finger nail. Through the dirt which is sometimes trapped there into the soft layer of skin, tearing it from its delicate join with the nail. Now Get in. Mum! ...Mum! Wake up. Oh, darling. Go to sleep. lt's Fanny and Doreen. l had such a strange dream. She's too heavy. l can't go any further. l'm sure she's going to wake. l've seen to that now get a move on! Sh! l can hear something? lt's you talking. -No, it's an engine. l can't hear nothing -You rarely can, dear. Just a little bit further. -l don't like this, l'm going back. Here we are. This is far enough. -Don't hang around or they'll get us too. Wait. l can hear something. l'm going back. Oome on! l know you're out there, wherever you are. Oome out! Oome out! Do your wickedness. See what a tasty morsel l have brought you. Good night, Madam. Sleep tight, Madam. Gabs: What's that? -Nothing. No, l heard something. -lt was nothing. There was -Gabs, come back. l wonder what it is? -Gabs... Gabs! Monsieur, dinner is served. lt's Dad. Mary, are you all right? l'm sorry, l'm so sorry How did it happen? -l don't know. Fanny came down and the front door was open. She then asked Olive and the men from the farm to search the grounds. Then they found her. She had teeth marks in her leg. -Now, you don't worry. Mum, are you okay? Don't be frightened. Oome in -No way. lt's spooky. Oan l go off to hunt wolves with Father David? Okay, but be careful. -l will. Seth: Just unbelievably muscular. l mean incredible to touch, run your fingers over, really taut... -Gabs: And what? Seth: Well... Gabs: Personality? -His inner thighs just drive me wild. Uh huh. -The fur's so soft and... -And what? Powerful. -Woh! You just want sex on tap. Look we need to talk. -What about? ls it the sex? No. l don't think so... -What do you mean, you don't think so. Look, l've been with someone else. l don't understand. l thought everything was going so... -Seth please let me... You bastard. Saying thatjust now. Where are you off to? -going for a walk. -Right. So? What happened? -What do you mean? Are you going to see him again? -No. ...No, l'm not going to see him. What do you say to him? What did he say to you? At the end. He just burst into tears and said he'd enjoyed it. -And then? He said he had to get back to his wife and pups Do you ever think about cubs? Yeah, all the time. l think l'd make a good dad... Look, l love you Seth. -l don't know, Gabs. l don't think you do. l really hate you for this. -Seth!... Seth!... Fuck it. Excuse me. Hello. Hi. My name's Polly. What are you doing? l'm kind of lost. Where are you going? l don't know. Are you in a rush? -Not really. Here So how come you're lost if you don't know where you want to end up? l don't know. Where do you think most people want to end up? Being happy, l suppose. Yeah, well that's it. l want to be happy. Are you very unhappy? Very -Me too. Look. Here's her prayer book. -lts mine. But l want to be seen walking into church clutching its ivory covers. She was my mistress and if anyone's going to pinch it. lt's me. Ooh, feel these camisoles. Real silk. -You'd better mind. l wore Madam's fur yesterday. l felt this itching, can't be nothing. Probably such good quality it's keeping me too warm. Scratching away all over, l was, and when l took it off, it had the moth. Oovered with them Larvae l was. All them little maggots wriggling about the folds of my skin. All along my arms and neck. Terrible it was. Still finding them and all. Now give me my gin. ... Quick! Someone's coming. Woh! Who lives here? -lt used to be my grandmother's room This is lush. This is great. l can't believe it, it's so comfortable and warm Wait. Oan't you see what big ears l have -All the better for me to nibble But my eyes. My eyes are enormous. -All the better to see me with. My, What big, hairy arms. -All the better to hold me. And what a big mouth l have. All the better for you to kiss me. Nice day out? -Hello Fanny, hello Doreen. Deaf as a bat, she is. -Don't you mean post fanny? Deaf as a post. No, no, bat. -Ouch! What are you doing? ls it turn up yet dear? -Ow! Have you seen the kids? Master Kester's out hunting the wolves. Ever so brave he is. And Miss Polly ... Are you in there Polly? Ye-es The door's locked are you okay? Yee-es. She's much more upset than she lets on. You saw them. They're completely drunk. Well grief comes out in different ways. Oh, l don't know. l wonder how upset Fanny actually was. Polly. l'm worried about you. -Mmmm? Andre doesn't look too perky this evening. -Yes, hasn't he aged since London. You know what they saying though? -No, what's that. He's totally in love -No! That boy was made for the one night stand. -Blatantly off the market. Who is it then? -Some fresh kid. Mike's spied him. Ask him -Mike! This lot's asking about Andre. -lt's not Andre. lt's Gabriel now. Whatever. -What can l say. lt's love. So why is this kid not here then? -He's non-pack. l don't believe it. Andre's not like that. He's never off the market. l'll say he is. l've seen the boy. -All right let's see. Oane him. Do you want a sausage? As long as you're not on the end of it. Did anyone ever tell you you've got lovely thighs. Sorry. l'm not in the mood. -Me neither, let's go. lt's Jason isn't it. -Yeah. But you can call me what you want. Get out of my face, Jase. There were no wolves in the Garden of Eden. Once they've made that choice there can be nothing but wickedness. Maybe she was dead already. Don't be so ridiculous. They like their victims to be alive, that's half the thrill to them. Permit me to know what we're up against, Kester. They're killers. And now we're trying to kill them. To tell you the truth, Father, l don't understand why we can'tjust leave them alone. Just think it's rather peculiar thats all. Only the doctor said that himself. Look, we are all tired and upset, that's the last thing l need. lt says in the certificate that it was shock and exposure. -Yes ... -and what about the teeth marks. Ok sure ... but what about the insulin. -She was ill, she was on all sort of drugs. You're late Kester. Oatch anything? -No. Night Kester. Polly is fast asleep. -l expect you're tired too. Mum, does wolves go to heaven? -l suppose some of them do. l think l might watch a bit TV. Good night mum. Alright darling, good night but don't stay awake too late. Mark, do you think... what would you do if Kester turned out to be a wolf? Don't be ridiculous. Yes, no, Yes, no... Hi. -l've been looking for you everywhere. Look l'm sorry about what happened. You Ok? -Yuh, fine. ... Do you notice something different about me? Well, you're wearing a crap outfit and you've got B.O. Are those my clues? Fuck you. You know damned well what l mean. Oan you smell her on me? -What d'ya mean? Your little Seth's gone out and fucked a girl, that's all. Your little Seth's realised what he's been missing. Are you surprised? l guess it's not exactly what l expected after we... So, how does it feel to be left behind? -What d'ya mean? Look at you. Oovered in hair. lt's hard to believe l ever let you near me. Really. -lt feels good. Really good. l mean this is what being a man's about, isn't it? What? -A man, Gabriel. Are you jealous? Look at me. Don't tell me you don't fancy me anymore, because l know you do. You'll want me all the more now. Real men, ones who fuck girls, have always been quite a turn on, haven't they? Masculine, strong in every way, but with just one weakness; women. So she really satisfies you does she? -Totally. lt's so brave? -Brave. Well, girls, you know. -Girls? You gotta be so careful. -What do you mean? Well, you know most of the time with your tadger... well, it's cool. But then other times you've just gotta be so careful. ... l mean, the teeth. Really tiny and really sharp. And sometimes... it's just like... Bitten off, right down to the root . -Shit! Like Russian Roulette. Every time. -How do you know? l've meet several guys. -What with no... Not a thing. You see it's hard being a real men Seth. lf that's your way, then that's cool and l hope you'll find happiness with her. l really mean that. Maybe it's my fault. Realising you're a wolf, coming to terms with being a wolf is not easy. Perhaps l pushed things too fast. l'm sorry. ... l guess you know there's a hunt on. Your lot took a pop at me yesterday. l'll be in the ruined church... lf you change your mind... -That's not very likely. Whatever. -Goodbye Seth. Goodbye. There are many wolves out there, secret wolves, and their silence serves only to fuel my act. Well, you're not acting for me. Let them get on with it. Kester, l'm not hearing you. -Yes you are Father and you're being really uncool about this. l mean where in the bible does it say, 'Thou shalt not be a wolf' They are sent to us by the Prince of Darkness, -Yes, but... No Kester, they seek to destroy that union which is sacred to the church. Marriage. Marriage is the reflection of our relationship to God. And Satan has sent them to try to undermine that mystical union. Look, l'm frozen. l'm going home. Well, l'll have to accompany you. -l'll be fine. l know the way. Don't be ridiculous. l couldn't possibly -l'll be fine. See you at service tomorrow. lf l see the wolves l'll send them in your direction. ... That's if they don't eat me first. -Kester! Damn. Why did you do this, God? You humiliated me in front of him. lf he'd seen me kill just one, he'd respect me. Not some old fuddy duddy. A real man who can control the lives of others. l am that sort of man, God. l can kill wolves. l hate them. l'm not afraid of blood. l'll tear their flesh apart with my bare hands, just you see. You should've waited around Kester. Seen the innards pouring out with me. Look, here's the heart. lt's still beating. l don't see why we have to go through all this. People like a chance to show their respect. lt effects them too you know. Well you wouldn't catch me trekking off to stare at someone else's dead grandmother. Dad is okay isn't he? -Well, he's been very quiet about it. but he was like that when your Grandfather died. He just likes to sort it out by himself. lt's a bit dank here isn't it? No, it's fine. You try lifting her upstairs. l'm so worried l'm keeping my Parsnip locked up all the time. My John's doing the same with the kids. -l'm setting all kind of traps. You should have said. Did l ever tell you that l was a green beret? Thank you for coming... The only will we find in the house was the one made before you were born. leaving everything to your father and to Fanny. She's not like that, she'd never do something like that. Doreen doesn't eat puddings. -Because she's a diabetic. Well don't you see? They could have poisoned her with the insulin. Look, l don't have all the answers. -Just accusations. l've seen a wolf. -Where my son? By the river. -Let's get him. Oome on, everyone, there're wolves about! You lead us Mark. Let's do it. Have you seen it, Father? -He was huge, teeth, really fierce. You're not prepared for this. Go to your homes, get your weapons and meet me at the ruined church. Alright lets go. Mary: The other day l saw Doreen wearing one of Granny's earrings. lt doesn't surprise me, the pair of them give me the creeps. ... Mum, l'm going out to get some fresh air. -Okay, but be careful. Don't go too far. The wolf is in the church. -Know he no shame? What are you doing here? -l had to see you. lt's not safe for you here. -l know. l... l had to see you. To explain. You don't need to explain a thing. -No l do. l've come to a decision. Spread out. You two, go down to the river. John, you and Bob go to the other side of the church. He's inside. l'll go and try to flush him out. You others get ready to catch him when he tries to bolt. Here father, you'd better take this. Thank you, Bob. -Blow his bloody brains out. You're going back to him? -l love him. l'm sorry. So am l. l feel like l've treated you both so badly. l just love him. l love you. -l love you too. l love you two times two. -That's not enough. You'd better go. They've spotted a wolf and the whole village is out to get him. -Gabs! Oome out! Oome out! Hi, l'm Gabriel. How dare you enter this sacred place. .. Move... Out! Go on! Don't hurt me. There's no need to be afraid l'm not going to do anything to you. You are the devil's work. l've done nothing wrong. l'm not that different from you. How dare you? l am nothing like you. (gun shot) Go back to your families and don't forget to lock your doors. Oan we have a look, Father? -l think we've all had enough excitement for tonight. l hope to see you all at the service tomorrow. Gabs. lt's only me. l've been thinking about what you said. You were right. Here l am. l left the girl. Things weren't bad between us, but well, l guess l just prefer wolves. You know you're the closest l've ever been to anyone. l wouldn't blame you if you tell me to fuck off. But l'm not going to. Do you remember the first day we met? l was quite scared of you then. l thought you were so sorted and confident and sexy, yuh very sexy and... shit! l don't know why l'm telling you this. l guess l was so surprised that someone like you would take an interest in me. Anyway, l've been thinking what you said and l love you. And l guess it was anger that made me go with Polly. Everytime l touched her, kissed her it gave me such a thrill to think of you watching me and how much it would hurt you. l've treated both of you so badly. But l love you Gabriel. l just hope you meant what you said because l'd like to give things another try. ... You haven't heard a word of what l've been saying, have you? Gabriel? ... Oome on wake up! ... Gabs! Blood! Gabs ... Gabs ... Who are you? They're onto us. What are you talking about? -ln the pub she was asking about my insulin. She's got no evidence. Anyway, who'd believe a hussey like that. Did you get rid of those vials and packaging -Yes. l want to make sure they don't smell a rat. The stench is pretty foul already, Fanny. (police siren) Today we are going to talk about the wickedness of wolves. The evil wolves who took the life of Madeleine Gladys Drax. ''And did those feet in ancient times ...'' ''Walk upon England's mountains green?'' ''And was the holy lamb of God... On England's pleasant pastures seen?'' ''And did the countenance divine.'' ''Shine forth upon our clouded hills?'' ''And was Jerusalem builded here... Among those dark satanic mills? This is heaven, isn't it? Gabs. You look different.
