Daddy has to go away for a while. -Can I come too? -No. -Aunt Elsa will be here soon. -I understand. -Do you want to play a little game? -No Come on. It's just between you and me. -It will be our game. -Maybe… This book is a gift from me to you. Our secret book. You must not show it to anybody. Not even to aunt Elsa. -Nobody. -What kind of book is this? Gabriella. When you're a priest you have to… -You know why we are here? -I know. Good. -Gunnar? Time to go. -I'm coming. I said I'm coming. Goodbye, sweetie. -What about her? -No, not her. Ericsson, come on. Let's go! PRESENT DAY GOTHENBURG Sorry to keep you waiting. -How are you? -Fine. How can you go on working after what just happened? Hi, welcome. Let me know when you're ready to order. -How's Sebastian? -What do you think? Did you and Björn find time to talk? -I regret being such an asshole. -You have to move on now. I don't care what you should've done. All I ask is for you to take on the responsibility for Sebastian. Now. During our marriage… I know I was acting strange. I know you were mad at me, but we could always… I cannot stand this again! I can change. Yes? -Is it the same? -Yes. The victim has the same symbol carved into her body as the previous victim. But we still can't determine what type of tool the perpetrator used when he nailed her hands to the floor. But it seems to be the same type of titanium nails. Dino will explain the details of the injuries later. So… You want to claim your inheritance already? I'm not dead yet. They say you'll be alright. -Sebastian sends his regards. -Sebastian… Göran… You're better than me. Promise me to keep it that way. Promise me that. Sure. I promise. -How are you? Are you okay? -Yes… Why here? And why now? What does he want? -"He"? -The brutality suggests it's a man. Perps are more sadistic when there's no relation… Here we go again. The motive is not always sexual. -So what is it then? -Power. -Any indications of sexual abuse? -No. -These days you have to read… -Solving violence with books? The kid's got a point. We can rule out the close relative… Okay! Enough! The autopsy report observes damage to the scalp and punctual hemorrhage on both eyelids. And… …bruises on the back of her neck… …indicate that the perpetrator held her with his right hand. -And the murder weapon? -Knife. The cut indicates a curved blade. The inscription is done with his left hand. The symbol is identical to the one found on the first victim. I've been trying to find a match to the symbol in our records, but… …couldn't find any. -Hi. Göran. -Siri. Hi, Yvonne. First and foremost, don't worry about Sebastian. He's fine. I just wanted to talk to you before you can see him. -Okay, but what happened? -You see… Sebastian frequently mentions your domestic situation in his diary. He seems worried and troubled, even though he might not let it show. -He has never… -He lost his granddad recently. -Could that explain his reaction? -Maybe. Sorry for your loss. Maybe he should stay home a couple of days from school? We discussed that, but he'd rather be with his friends in school… Really? Did he say that? Good. But I still want you to see the school's welfare officer. How about the day after tomorrow? Three o'clock? Four? -Three is fine. -Four. Four o'clock, then. GÖRAN LIDMAN AND ANDERS NORDSTRÖM The police still won't give away any details regarding the investigation of the two women who were recently found brutally murdered. The chief commissioner commented on the case earlier today. Any description of the killer? We believe the killer is a man. Between 20-40 years of age. In other words, you have no leads whatsoever? We sure do. Our experts are working on a more specific profile. Any comments on the fact that both victims are female? No, not at the moment. This highly unusual solar eclipse is expected during the next few days. Astronomers encourage people to witness this miracle of nature. The eclipse is estimated to culminate at 1.05 pm, Wednesday… …next week… next… next… WHEN THE SIXTH CANDLE IS LIT, MAN IS FOREVER LOST IN THE DARK. -Even more coordinates? -Yes. Each one pointing out different locations in Gothenburg. -And I can't find any pattern either. -I've got a bad feeling about this. The coordinates lead to new coordinates… And when I've found them all, I can find it. -I don't want to do this anymore. -What do you mean?! -I need to drop out while I can. -God's hand is here in Gothenburg! We can find it! Don't drop out now! We're so close to finding it! -If it exists. -It exists! Sons of God are murderers! This is a police matter. I've risked enough already by proving connections to the Finnish murders. This is so much bigger than that! The hand of God… can stop them! This is not the last we've seen. We must stop them! -Okay, but this is my last effort. -Yes… -What is it? -If you need help. Thanks. -Hey. Don't worry. Trust me. -This won't change anything… I know! See you soon. Okay? I've been waiting quite a while to see Nordström and Lidman. -I heard you the first time. -And what is it that's taking so long? -They're busy! -What do you not understand? -Calm down, please. Sit down. -I'll stand and calm down. While you're having coffee, another ritual murder will occur. Wait a second. What did you just say? -She calls herself The Pastor. -Her real name is Gabriella Berggren. She claims she has information. There's no address or phone number in her name. No rap sheet. -What has she said so far? -Not much. She mentioned an occult group called "Sons of God." So you've been a priest for 13 years? -I want to help you investigate this. -Why? Because you have no idea who you're dealing with. How would you be able to help us investigate this case? What do you know about invocation? -Invocation of spirits. -Alright. That's what Sons of God are doing. Invoking evil spirits. -Is it a satanic cult? -It has nothing to do with Satanism. -That's just how the media labels it. -Sons of God? Their goal is to invoke evil, beyond every nightmare. -Thanks. Gabriella. -I don't expect you to understand. Three weeks ago, I received this. WHEN THE SIXTH CANDLE IS LIT… I know who wrote it. His name is Peter Eriksson. Where can we find him? -Well? -I don't know what to believe. She might as well be the perp. Sometimes they want to help just to find out what the police knows. -We can't arrest her for that. -Leave nothing to chance. -This guy Peter Eriksson… -That name is a bit too common. What do you think? -Check it. -Sure. Peter Eriksson, Erik Petterson and Börje Eriksson. -Is it the same person? -Yes. -Did you steal these? -No. -Why do you have all those IDs? -They were given to me. If they have found Peter Eriksson it won't be long until they find me! Nothing's gonna happen to you. Peter had been dead a few days when we found him. His injuries were different from the others. What could that mean? Probably that he is not a part of the ritual. He glances towards the sky. He betrayed Sons of God and is now being held accountable before God. But these victims are facing the ground. Facing… hell? I met Peter Eriksson once. -When? -1975. Gabriella? What are you doing? Daddy has to go away for a while. They took him away. I haven't seen Dad since then. It's not the first time these kind of murders occur. Dad spent a major part of his life trying to track down Sons of God. He went to Finland where six people had been killed within a week. All six of them had the same message carved into their backs… "Sanguinis, ut rursus emergant…" What does it mean? "Of my blood, thou shall rise again." Sons of God control and manipulate. And they stop at nothing to fulfil their prophecy. What prophecy? "When the sixth candle is lit, man is forever lost in the dark." We have to contact the Finnish police. -Sons of God, what is their goal? -No idea. -How many are there? -We only know of one person. He is called "The Collector" by some… -Can you get in touch with him? -I'll see what I can do. Sons of God? They're commonly known as angels. But in former times they were called Sons of God. -They loved and worshipped Her. -"Her"? -Did I say "Her"? -Yes. I meant Him, of course. However, it all changed when God created mankind. I guess the angels felt a bit forgotten and became jealous. So one of them wanted to manipulate God's new creation. He disguised himself as a snake and made Eve eat the forbidden fruit. I understand. After such a deceit he and his followers got locked out of heaven. I have to go. Thanks, you've been very helpful. Thanks. Hi. Where's the welfare officer and where's Yvonne? -They've gone home. -What do you mean? The meeting was at 4 p.m. You're an hour late. Damn it. My mistake. Let's keep in touch. You can talk to me instead. Now that you're here. -Have you talked to Sebastian yet? -Not really… -Because… -Why not? The reason is… that I… that I became the person I didn't want to be. -Which means? -Like my dad. -What was he like? -He was also a police officer. He kept telling me not to repeat his mistakes. -But… -It's never too late. -But why are you doing it then? -I did what I had to. You have to work to support a family. If you won't change, how do you expect the situation to change… Don't tell me how to raise my son! Sorry. I didn't mean to… I think you should talk to Sebastian. I believe he needs to get in touch with his dad. -Thanks for taking the time. -Thanks. Bye. -Are you gonna sleep all day? -So you're here? -I'm hungry. -I'll be right up. -I don't want pancakes! -Come on, they're your favorite! When I was six. -I guess you want coffee then? -Very funny. Big, strong boys always have pancakes for breakfast. I wanna talk to you. Don't touch anything. What are you doing? -She might see what we're missing. -There's a body here! -You can't bring her here! -Let her have a look! Bullshit! Isn't it a bit risky to kill him here? They live, breathe and bleed for their faith. The perp left no trace whatsoever. We have nothing. You can't trace him. We're gonna do this my way. Today we'll visit The Collector. As you wish. -Yes? -Hello. Detectives Lidman and Nordström. This is Gabriella. -I'm a bit busy at the moment… -Markus Cederström? I'm not Markus. I'm Erik Larsson, his personal assistant. Markus is asleep right now. What's it all about? -We have some questions… -Don't disturb him now. -What's it about? -Sons of God. -Erik?! -It's the police. -We're not buying anything! -It's the police! I see. Ask them to come in. What's it about? Gabriella is convinced that you can help us. That's nonsense! We've heard that you're familiar with Sons of God. That boys' choir? Erik? Do you know the choir in the neighboring village? Have you seen this symbol before? Is that a moose? -Or a deer? -He's wasting our time. You're the one we should talk to. -I don't know what you're talking… -It's okay, Markus. How did you know? You can't be too careful. Markus helps me to keep nosy people away. Have you seen this symbol before? Yes, but not like this. It's a tree. Why didn't we think of that? The tree of knowledge. -Why the tree of knowledge? -That's where it all began. What do you know about Sons of God? It's a cult. They left Christianity in the early 16th century. The Bible is still their holy writ, but they interpret it differently. The Bible describes our Lord, our Father, as the only God. Sons of God believe that if there's a Father, there's also a Mother. A female counterpart. The Mother is allegedly condemned to hell due to disobedience… They claim that the pages about her have been removed from The Bible. There are many religious views that worship a female god. But none are as extremist as Sons of God. So you mean that God had a woman by his side? I don't mean anything. But Sons of God are convinced. So this "Mother" was a bad girl? If women are mentioned in The Bible, they're described as temptresses. Unreliable creatures, in general. This liberation of The Mother, how will it be done? According to the prophecy, she will find her way back guided by the six candles. Sons of God won't create a stir for no reason. -I think they may have found the gate. -The gate? The gate that will enable The Mother to return. Excuse me, I have to… What's gonna happen when this Mother is let through the gate? They believe Paradise will arise on earth. That's their belief. What's yours? -What does this mean? -It's a list of the six candles. You mean six people, don't you? The first candle signifies "The complete believer." The second: "The abandoned lover." The third: "The first gift from God." Fourth: "The weak flower from above." Fifth: "The unexpected." Sixth: "The one of free will." Why not light them all at the same time? Nothing is ever that simple. But why Gothenburg? Why here? What's so special about this place? Only a member of Sons of God can answer that. "Nisi credideritis non intelligentis." "The one who does not believe, cannot understand." Be careful. Sons of God have infiltrators everywhere. Even if you do not believe, they do. You knew it already! You wrote the letters! You wrote the letters and left them at my place! Admit it! -Answer me! -Leave me alone! What are you doing?! How can you be so sure? Angels, demons, God, the Devil, heaven and hell… Or leprechauns, damn it. Anders, please. -Evil, for instance… -It's human nature! It has always existed, and always will. Stop it! I just wanted to see that you were okay! Stop it! I just wanted to see that you were okay. -Beat it! Get lost! -I will! Calm down. Sebastian? Are you still awake? Damn it! It's bedtime! Why can't you ever do as you're told?! -Is that so strange? -What did you just say? -Give me that phone! Go to bed! -Get out of my room! -Be careful with Granddad now, he’s tired. -No. Granddad can handle it, you’ll see. Shall we arm wrestle? Yes. -Gabriella? I see you. -No, you don't. Come here. -What is that? -It's the… hand of God. -What's it for? -Something very important. Why is it so important? Because Vexi says it's very important! Elsa Bengtsson was here for her mother's funeral. Three days later, she was murdered in her hotel room. Johansson. You and Robin interrogated Högberg's neighbors. -What did they tell you? -That she studied political science. She dropped out two months ago when her boyfriend passed away. They lived together in the apartment. She changed drastically when the boyfriend passed away. We went there and took pictures. Hoffa, did you find out anything more about the man in the garage? -His name was Mattias… -Was that all? It's pitch black here, I can't see a thing. He lived alone, worked as an economist. According to the neighbor, he recently lost his father… All three victims recently lost a family member. Could it be the same undertaker? Or the same cemetery? No, Mattias's dad passed away in Växjö. The neighbor said Mattias was completely devastated. Another neighbor claims that Mattias and his dad weren't that close. They had their quarrels before he passed away. Why would someone visit a medium after losing a relative? To communicate. Go back. -Robin. Locate a Lea Pålsson. -Who? Lea Pålsson. There's two of them: Lea Lilja Pålsson at Anders Persgatan 13 and Lea Christina Pålsson at Mariagatan… -We'll go to Anders Persgatan. -Yes. Police! Call an ambulance. We need an ambulance to Anders Persgatan 13. It's urgent! An ambulance is on its way. Calm down, calm down. They'll be here any minute. They're coming. Police! Keep your hands where I can see them! Lie down! I said down! Did you hear that? -Anybody there? -No. Okay. Let's try again. Where is it? Where is it? Where's the dagger?! Where's the hand of God? I don't know! If the police don't know where she is, it could be anywhere… I know! I know. Here. No time to waste. No! I'm pregnant! Please! I don't want to die! I don't want to die! Please… I can't… No! No, no, no… You can hide her instead. -Understood? -Yes. I understand. Gabriella… I should've stopped him… Like with your father. Do you remember me? I used to visit you from time to time. I often wondered when you would figure out what really happened… When did little Gabriella understand that her father wouldn't come home? Do you know where he's buried? Any clue why they never found him? In the backyard where you two used to play together… That's where we buried him. Your father… -No! -Do it. Do it! Do it. Do it… He knew… Your father understood where this was going… I couldn't understand how he could doubt the message of the Mother? You look like him… You look so much like your father… Please. Kill me. I want you to kill me. Please… -What's going on? -Nothing! Yes, I know. We need to hurry up. Did you get the car? We need to get the body out of here. Come on. -Can you stop poking me? -Whine, whine. -Come on, it hurts. -I like your bruises. They get rid of that cute boy band-look. Whatever you say. So you mean like this? Where have you been? You've been gone for days! And now you're back looking like that? -Help me. -I don't like this. -We must report this. -Absolutely not. Come. Are you a doctor? She needs a hospital, damn it! No, no, they'll find me. I don't know who to turn to. You need somewhere to hide. -Are you awake? -Yes. How are you? Sebastian. We need to talk about Grandpa. What's there to talk about? I miss him. The unpredictable and the one of free will. It could be anyone? Then someone who does it willingly. Yes. Unfortunately… So there's no challenge? That makes him unpredictable. He wants to terrify. And so he does. What do we do? One more biscuit and I'll shoot you. Hi, been running a long time? Sorry? No, I'm just about to start. -I just did a 50-minute run. -And you're not even sweaty. You wanna run with me too? 50 minutes, hard core interval. -Hard core? -Just press the button. - How long were you together? - 13 years. -Any kids other than Sebastian? -No. We tried, but it just didn't work. We had a miscarriage about two years ago. That's when our problems began… Yes? Good. Ask Jari to go to Skogsvägen. Go ahead with 93-10. At her, yes. Good. Bye. Sorry, work. So, where were we? Your job kept interfering and she grew tired of that. Right? Göran… -What are your thoughts about this? -About what? You and me. What do you want? Us sitting here is no coincidence. You came to the gym 'cause you wanted to see me, right? Listen. Some people think I'm a bit too pushy. But I don't like that side of me. Not at all. But when I'm with you I feel like… -I'm so damn pathetic. -Not at all. Or… just a little. It's just that… I guess I wasn't prepared for… …everything at once. I hope you don't expect too much from me. Maybe I'm not who you think I am. Come on. More wine? No, sorry… I meant coffee. Come on, then. Here's your bedroom. It's not much, but… Just try to make yourself at home. -Hello! -Hi… -How about a shower? -Sure! Damn it… -You took your time, didn't you? -Well, it's early. -What are you doing in there? -Yvonne… I need Sebastian's school bag, he left it here. Here it is. -Anybody there? -No. -Is Nordström here? -Yes. -Hi. -Hi. What the hell are you doing?! Are you out of your mind? It's Sebastian's teacher! You're insane! Isn't this what you wanted? Me moving on. Anything else? -Sorry about that. -You don't have to explain. Get the gun! Top shelf in the closet! Do it now! Come on! Let's go! Listen. Don't worry. Another car will take you to a safe house. -Yes. You'll get witness protection. -Are you leaving me? -It doesn't matter… -Sorry. I wish I could tell you more. I need to get hold of a… I need to call a substitute teacher. Siri?! Heard anything from the Finnish police yet? They might have a sketch of the perpetrator. They will send the investigation report. -When? -As soon as possible. Lidman? It's Erik Larson. The Collector. I need your help. Marcus… I think there's someone in the house. Hello? Hello? -We have to go to the Collector… -No. You're staying here. -End of discussion! -Take a look at this. New riots occurred this morning in Gothenburg. While police are trying to restore order, reports of assault and battery are coming in. Gothenburg is paralyzed by several simultaneous power cuts. 200,000 people have no electricity and Gothenburg's rescue service is completely overpowered by worried citizens. It's still unclear… -What the hell? -People are scared of the dark. And when people are scared, they do strange things. We can't just stay here and wait for electricity. -Power's back? -It's the backup generator. Imagine the chaos out there, looters seizing the opportunity. Hoffa and Klintan, come with me. Lidman, stay right here. -Thanks. -Okay, bye. -What is she doing here? -She needs protection. Please… Hello. I'm Siri. The Finnish police are just about to send us the report. -Come on! Is it disconnected? -Robin. Call the Finnish police. Tell them that we're only interested in the sketch. Nordström? Have you seen Hoffa? -7731. Nothing to report. -Copy that. Get back in touch in an hour. Over and out. Excuse me. -I guess you exercise a lot? -Whenever this job gives me a chance. Are you trained to defend yourself in any situation? Yes, absolutely. What would you do if somebody came this close? Like I am now? I want you to see this. Let me see. I have no idea. You know, sometimes life is just full of surprises. Nordström? Put down your gun, or… If you want to say anything to Klintan, do it now! Jari! Get the pastor out of the safe house! He's already dead. Göran? Darling? -Darling? -Yes? Come to Esperantoplatsen alone. Or bring all your staff. It doesn't matter. You decide. Come with me. The spikes that nailed Jesus, the son of God to the cross. The blood of God is on these spikes. Many have died by the hand of God. The hand of God is lethal to us. But it brings life to the Mother. And that's just what we need. -Where are they? -Damn it! We can't go in there! -Well, we need to do something! -Sure. Let's walk into the trap. -This was a bad idea. -Yes. But do you have a better one? Yes. More than one. You could say that Sons of God gave me a new perspective. We are born into this world to commit gruesome actions. Man is evil. So what can we do? Man must agree to change, or cease to exist… -Why?! -Eternal life, Nordström. Eternal life. You're grinning? I'll give you something to laugh about. Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. -Thy kingdom come… -…Thy will be done. On earth as it is in heaven. -Give us this day our daily bread… -And forgive us our trespasses… …as we forgive those who trespass against us… And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. For Thine is the kingdom, the power and the glory, forever. Amen. Take her to the ritual room when she's lost enough blood. …the power and the glory, forever. Amen. Wait! Lidman! Help! Robin! Take care of Johansson! Lidman! Police! Down on the ground! Welcome, the one of free will. Where is she?! Where is Gabriella? -Where is she?! -Bring him here. Who are you? Does it matter? I really wish I could tell you more. Please. Don't… It's too late. We have pledged our allegiance to her through our flesh and blood. Everything shall be consumed by light. Amen. One for the fulfilled believer. One for the abandoned mistress. One for the first gift from God. One for the feeble flower from above. One for the unpredicted. And one for the Mother to keep. The one who came of free will. When the Mother has arrived, and your life is extinguished, the sixth candle will be lit and mankind will forever fumble, lost in the dark. It's time! Time for you to come forward and claim what is yours! She is so strong. She is so strong. Brother… -We must release him. -Pull. -Pull! -It's too tight! -What is that? -The hand of God. It's for something very important. For a greater cause. Come on! Come on! Wake up! Gabriella! Wake up! Wake up! -It hurts here. -Stop it. -And it hurts a lot right here. -Stop it! Ouch! But, hey… Damn it… We are gathered here to bid farewell to Björn Lidman. He will pass over into the good and strong hands of God. Björn was full of life. He had a big heart, with room for many people. As you told me, Göran. He was always there for you and Sebastian. A prouder granddad is hard to find. -Why are we lighting candles? -It's for those who passed away. Let's go.
