"Spanish Autumn" by Hans Haider CLEAVER THUDS This lamb isn't from the valley, it smells different. Nobody can tell better than you, my dear. Grandmother bought only lamb from the valley but times were different then. If the old convent could have known it was suddenly going to be filled every day with half-naked tourists, the walls would have fallen down. Because the museum was opened. We never served so many meals! Nor has the house been so full before. I'm not interested in making more money if we have to have the Devil live in our midst. Aren't we supposed to call that girl? Last night she didn't ask for a call. It's ten o'clock. - Let her sleep. Nobody's expecting her. She came alone. Well, at least if she's sleeping she's not prancing about showing off parts of her body that should be covered up. - This one is really good! Oi! Why not take off everything? What's that? I have no idea. - MAN CONTINUES SHOUTING Something happening on the terrace. MAN OUTSIDE LAUGHS Wahey! Oh, she's very beautiful! Oh, isn't she lovely? Oh, come on little baby! Come on, little blonde beauty! Wahey! Oi, sweetheart, what's your name? Ho, ho, ho, what a doll! She must be English. Eh, why not stand up so we can see you better? Hey, why not sunbathe at my place, eh? Shameless hussy in my house! What's wrong? You have the cheek to ask? Get up! Give me that! SHE GROANS - Get out of here. This isn't a whorehouse. I was just sunbathing, I don't think that's fair. Just the way God brought you into the world, eh? And scandalising the whole village! What the hell are you talking about? Are you crazy? Listen! If you think I'm going to let you... - Shut your mouth! ...like this you're very wrong! - You harlot! If you were my daughter, I'd teach you some decency! Let me go, don't touch me! Stop pushing me! I don't want you a minute longer in my house. SHE SCREAMS GLASS SHATTERS Marta! - I didn't do it. She's dead. It was providence. A divine punishment. Don't say that. It was an accident. Look. "Prelude and Fugue in G minor, BWV 542 by J.S. Bach But that's sacrilege! GLASS CLATTERS She killed herself. She has been punished by God. We were his hand of justice. I'll go call the police. No! Why not? - Because it wasn't an accident. I'm sure of it. KNOCK ON DOOR - MUSIC STOPS Open the door. I'll hide the body. No one must find out what happened. I don't understand you. Go down! And don't say a thing to anybody about this. INDISTINCT STREET CHATTER Good morning. Oh, I'm sorry. The door was open. Good morning. I'm Laura Barkley, I've come to join my sister. May Barkley, she's staying here. Yes. I mean, she was staying here but... she left this morning. Well, did she leave any message? You see, we arranged to meet here. Are you sure she didn't leave any message? No, she didn't. Oh well, she'll probably be back tonight. Oh, no. I don't think she's coming back. She paid her bill and took away her things. She must have had to go and pick up some extra shots. I'll wait for her here. You have a room for me? No. Let her in, Veronica. We'll do everything we can so that you and your sister can stay together. My name is Marta, my sister is Veronica. Thank you. Veronica, why don't you show the young lady to her room? I've just finished tidying it. Tidiness is the motto in our house. Will you come this way, please? Thank you. CHICKENS CLUCK We couldn't let her go away. She might have become suspicious. What are we going to do? Where's her sister? She said she was going to look around. She's coming down now. I'm just going out for a while if May should come back, will you tell her I'm here? Yes, of course. DOOR CLOSES Close the doors. Was a girl called May Barkley on your bus this morning? Just a moment, I'll look through the lists. If she was on it, it will be here. Barkley, Barkley, Barkley, Barkley, Barkley... No, her name is not here. Are there any other buses? Oh, but she may have taken a taxi, there are two in the village. INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE DOG BARKS SHE MOANS SHE GASPS SHE RETCHES SHE COUGHS Veronica? Anything wrong? No, Marta. It's nothing. You're still awake. It's very late, go to sleep. Don't you think we should have called the police? It was her own fault, she slipped. It was an accident. Marta? Marta! Be quiet! Years ago that shameless girl would have been burned alive... in the public square. "Prelude and Fugue in G minor, BWV 542 by J.S. Bach You see? You see? QUIET INDISTINCT CHATTER I'm her sister. Are you sure you don't remember seeing her? I think I know who you mean. She came nearly every day. I'm sorry, there are so many photographers. Perhaps ask the attendant in the cloister. The other attendant told me you might have seen her. I know her. Her name's May and she's taking photographs of these paintings for an English company. Is that right? Yes, you know her? Yes, we were going to have lunch together. She said she was bringing along her sister. You? Yes, that's right. When did you last see her? A couple of days ago. Well, when I arrived, I was told that May had just left but no one seems to know where she's gone. Did she say anything to you? - No, she didn't. I expected to meet her here. Is anything wrong? No. No, it's nothing. She'll probably turn up later. But thanks anyway. - That's OK. "Prelude and Fugue in G minor, BWV 542 by J.S. Bach MUSIC FADES - INDISTINCT CHATTER INDISTINCT CHATTER IN SPANISH Enjoy your lunch, Beatriz? Oh, beautiful, Marta. Really delicious, wasn't it, Pablo? Marta, you haven't told us anything about your latest guests. What can I tell you, Beatriz? You know all about it. I don't know how I put up with it. One must earn a living. Serve more wine. Marta, what were you talking about? The girl... - Everything is going perfectly. Is she coming down for lunch? - No. Luis... Luis. Yes? - Take this up to the young lady. Straight away. KNOCK ON DOOR - Come in. Your lunch. Oh, I'm sorry. Thank you, but I'm not hungry. Did you know my sister, May? The girl who left yesterday? I didn't really know her but I saw her several times. She's very pretty. Did she mention anything to you about where she was going before she left? I wasn't here. She was sunbathing on the terrace yesterday. Some friends of mine told me but I didn't see her. She was sunbathing? Then she packed her things and left? That must have been just before I arrived. I've got work to do. Excuse me, se√±orita DOOR CLOSES Watch out! Why were you so long with her? It's just that she kept on talking. I don't want you ever to enter her room. Now don't pick up from the grocer. I'll go myself. That way I can get out of the house. Wait for me. What are you doing here? Take that back to the kitchen.

I'll just leave my things and my passport here. I'm going to the swimming pool. It's at the Parador\x22 isn't it? See you. Wait! Wait a minute, please, uh... We've got nothing vacant. Wait! Please, wait a minute! What else can you do? You can't always say no. After all, you're running a guest house. What are you looking for? - SHE GASPS Some more table napkins. - You know they're not kept in there. The cash box is. There were 200 pesetas missing yesterday. I never touched that cash box. Then who did it? That boy? We'll have to call the police. He wouldn't do it. - Why do you always defend him? He doesn't even know where you keep the money. You are very certain of what he knows and what he doesn't know. Hello. You've taken a long time getting here. Wait. But don't look. I won't look. Turn your back. I want to look. It's not right. But I like to look at you. I like you as you are. Take everything off. That's an even greater sin. Why? - I don't know. Even married couples don't do it. Then I will take it off. Wait, Luis... What's wrong? Luis... I'm afraid. My sister found out the money was missing. The money I gave you. I told you I didn't want the money. Every time I come here I'm afraid I might be followed. If she found out about us... I think she'd kill me. Veronica? Veronica? Luis? Hey, come on, get your clothes off! Do it naked! MEN CHATTER Bah! You're crazy! WATER SLOSHES - PEOPLE CHATTER Quickly! Don't push me! How can I go in the water without my trunks? INDISTINCT CHATTER I can't go in the water naked. Hey, get off me. Don't push me! Leave me alone. Don't annoy me! Go away!

BELL CHIMES You will have to give me some money, Marta. I have to go to the market tomorrow. Why are you doing that? Why not? I wore it for the first time at Beatriz's wedding. That is the dress that man gave to you and you shouldn't wear it. - Why? I don't know. I just don't think it's right. It's not right, is it? But it's alright when you get all excited at seeing Luis in the courtyard? Twenty years younger than you! And it's alright to steal money from your sister why do you do it, Veronica? Do not speak so loud. You'll wake up that girl. I don't care. I've nothing to hide. CLOCK TICKS STEADILY KNOCK ON DOOR Hi! I finally got here. Miss... I must tell you something. Well! That's quite a change. I didn't notice. You look much prettier. - Don't touch me. Have you got a lover, hm? I was decent when young as I am decent now. My house is a respectable house. I don't like young ladies coming in at late hours. And what about you? Alright, alright, don't get upset. Really, you look 40 years younger. Goodnight. SHE HUMS A TUNE You hear me, Veronica? Look the door at 11 o'clock tomorrow night. Veronica, look. Scandalising the whole village. "Big Beat" by Klaus Wuesthoff INAUDIBLE Is it possible to have a ride on your donkey? INDISTINCT CHATTER Doesn't it seem strange to you, Veronica that a woman like that has taken a room in our house? What are you thinking about, Marta? About what happened to that shameless hussy. You know, it wasn't an accident. She deserved it. That girl's the same? Or worse. Marta, you shouldn't speak as if you knew the will of our Lord. God has mercy for all his creatures. Not for all of them, Veronica not for all of them. - PIPE PLAYS The knife sharpener. Take the knives to him and these as well. INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE I'm very worried about not hearing anything from my sister. Are you sure that you haven't received a... a telegram or a telephone call? Uh, no, not a thing. Well, don't you remember if she mentioned where she was going before she left? She said nothing. She left and that's all there is to it and furthermore I'm glad she's no longer here. I know she's your sister, but you are different. What do you mean by that? I mean nothing. Have you seen how that Helen Miller dresses, so provocative and indecent? Yes, I've seen her. They think it's the modern style but it's pure indecency. You are also a foreigner but your dress is normal. It's elegant. Sometimes people wear other clothes to be more comfortable. Comfort's no excuse. I would never dream to walk about the house in my underwear to be more comfortable. Will you have breakfast? No, thank you. Ah, any news from your sister? No, not yet. What do you think of this? I bought it from an old woman in the village. You'd have to travel a long way before you'd find anything half as good as this. Oh, it's beautiful. Who is she? - Her name's Helen. She's staying at the same mansi√≥n. She'll be back in a minute. Do you want to meet her? Of course. She looks the kind that is looking for sun and adventures to last them the rest of the year. Don't you approve of that? - Who, me? Naturally, they don't do anybody any harm. Why don't you explain that to the owners of the mansi√≥n? According to them, unless you're dressed from head to foot you should be burning in hell, and the sooner the better. DOOR CLOSES Oh! - THEY LAUGH INDISTINCT CHATTER No, not so soft. Harder! - Shh! Don't you feel grown up tonight? Go to bed now. - SHE COOS SHE GIGGLES They caught us! I'll see you. Buenas noches, se√±ora. "To bed", he says and walks away. Leaving me alone. Leaving me! Be quiet, there are people sleeping. What's the matter? What are you staring at? You are drunk. Go to bed. Tomorrow, pack up your things and leave. You'll stay no more in this house. I'll leave... but first I'd like to know what you've got under all those clothes that makes you so different from me from other women. Let's see! - What are you doing? Shh! You'll wake up all your guests. What have you got hidden under there, eh? Come on, tell me. I won't tell anybody. You are mad. You must have the same thing as everyone else or don't you? Are you crazy? Even bigger than mine! Now, let's see what you've got down... MARTA YELLS Let me see it. Let me see it. I won't tell anybody. I promise. SHE YELLS SHE SCREAMS SHE GRUNTS The other girl. She's sleeping. She didn't hear anything. She's only pretending. She heard everything. Veronica, we must. Marta! Don't do it! No, no! She's only pretending, Veronica. Pretending, don't you see? Marta... "Prelude and Fugue in G minor, BWV 542 by J.S. Bach We'll do the same with her as with the other one. Don't be afraid. Nobody will ever find out. You defended me, Veronica. You defended your sister. - VERONICA WHIMPERS That was good. That was good. Help me. VERONICA SOBS CHILDREN SING IN SPANISH Good morning, do you have a vacant room? Of course, my dear. Why do you carry the baby like that? Is it safe? Oh, yes, I assure you, it's quite safe. Come in, come in. Ah... What a beautiful baby. Her mother's very pretty. Don't you think she looks a bit uh... a little sad? Her husband wasn't able to come with her. I can't see how he can let them travel alone... and with an eight-month-old baby and the way she carries him. I hope she stays with us for a while. It must be wonderful to have a baby like that Yes, it's more work, but I don't mind. But seems to be a nice girl. You only have to look at her face. Helen? Oh, I was looking for Helen. She went early this morning. - Did she say when she was coming back? You misunderstood. The young lady who occupied this room left the village this morning. But that's impossible. Well, that's what happened. She got up almost as early as we did and paid her bill. Did anyone call her? We don't keep a check on all the phone calls our guests may make or receive and her departure is no great loss to us. Friendship of that girl would never be good for you. I think you're being very unfair and I don't like the way you're always criticising people. The truth always hurts. Prepare my bill, I'm leaving. Did I offend her? You shouldn't have spoken to her like that. Laura's a good girl. I told her for her own good but that's up to her. Make up her bill, let her go. BABY COOS Excuse me, are you staying here? Yes, I arrived this morning. You staying here too? Yes, I was. A lovely baby, bye-bye. Bye. Will you be staying here for a while? I don't really know. I think so. - If you need anything... anything at all, will you call me? My name's Laura, you can find me any time at the museum or at the inn. What? Oh, I see. Do you mean because of the baby? Don't worry, I can manage myself but thank you very much anyway. Your room is ready. You can go up whenever you wish. I'll take it. Follow me, please. Hello there, coming to stay here? - Hello. Yes, but only for a couple of days. By the way, how is Helen this morning? - What do you mean? I had to see her home last night. She had one too many. - You took her home? What did the sisters say? - Nothing. They told me that Helen had left the village this morning. Doesn't that seem strange to you? No. She was a little lonely and bored. She hadn't found that adventure to last her the rest of the year. Eduardo, are there any police in this village? Police? What on Earth do you want a policeman for? I don't know, but are there? In a tiny village like this, I don't think so but I suppose the nearest to the police would be the mayor, but why? BIRDSONG You say she has disappeared? And the other girl as well? But those girls travel around a lot, nobody can control them. Where do we put the new gate? - I'll be with you in a minute. We've no way of knowing whether they just left, or... Do you know the sisters well? If you mean I'm one of their regular customers, no. They belong to another generation. There's something about them. I'm worried. Well, several years ago Do√±a Marta was about to marry but her fianc√© disappeared on her wedding day. He had eloped with a younger more modern girl. Do√±a Marta was ill for some time. In town they say she is crazy. Now there's another foreign girl staying there. What do you want me to do? Do you want me to speak to Do√±a Marta? No. That would be useless. I'm very happy today. You are not on other days? Don't you like our new guest? I like you more. SHE CHUCKLES - The baby is so nice, never cries. I do hope they stay for a while. Why don't you sit down here? I haven't seen my sister so good-tempered for a long time. She doesn't spy on me, she doesn't even watch the money. Stay. - No, Luis. Don't you understand? The baby might need something. Sometimes his mother leaves him alone. I must get back to him right away. Going for a walk? Yes, I want to do some shopping. We've bought something for you. A present for both of you. Are you going to stay here long? A few days, see you later. A beautiful baby. Boy or girl? - A boy. Isn't he uncomfortable like that? - On the contrary. The Incas used this method, so it's been tried out a long time ago. Very comfortable. Oh, yes, the Incas. How much is it? - Twenty pesetas. His father will be very pleased to receive such nice postcards. His father? Who knows where he might be. If you can find one for me, let me know. "Cantate pour Deux Coeurs" by J. Nilovic, L. Auguste and J. Delacour Good afternoon, Marta. Hello, Veronica. Good afternoon, Beatriz. - You want something, Beatriz? No, nothing at all. I was just passing by. Listen, we have been friends all our lives, haven't we? Why do you say that? I want you to know that I am telling you for your own good. It is about that girl who just arrived, the one with the baby. What about her? Oh, nothing really... Ah, after all business is business. You can't refuse to rent her a room just because of that. And maybe you don't even know. Know what? Speak up, Beatriz, what are you talking about? She's not married and she's got a baby. But she told us that... And don't believe that it's just gossip she had the effrontery to say in the tobacconist that she didn't know who the father was. Poor little baby. Girls nowadays are just tramps. You know who I was thinking of. That shameless wench that fooled your fianc√© and ran away with him. Just like her. Remember we heard she had had a baby. CAMERA CLICKS Excuse me? Yes, se√±orita? Can you take a message for me, please? She deceived us, Veronica. She's not married. And the poor little baby. She deceived us. I got your message. What did you want to talk to me about? - I don't really know how to begin. Until a few days ago my sister was staying at the mansi√≥n. We'd arranged to meet there but when I arrived the owners told me that she'd left without saying where she was going. I don't understand. I just can't find her. Well, then a Dutch girl arrived she was staying at the same mansi√≥n. This morning she disappeared as well. Disappeared? You mean she left? No, she didn't leave by bus, I checked that. She might have... - Taken a taxi? No. Don't you think you're worrying too much? Maybe I am... but I'm afraid. Of what? I don't know. Perhaps it's all just my imagination. When are you thinking of leaving? I haven't made up my mind yet, within a few days or so. Will you promise me something? When you do leave, will you let me know? I want to be certain nothing happens to you. BABY CRIES He must be upset, that's why he's crying. Bring me the basin, it's necessary to change him. Poor baby, if it weren't for us, a lot of attention his mother pays to him! How could I have been so wrong about her? So clear to see that she's a sinner. Give me one of those new towels over there and see if his mother has any talcum powder. There's absolutely nothing here. Do you think she cares if he cries or gets sick? Or if the baby needs something? All she thinks about and wants is what she looks for every night, a man, any man. He is a pretty child, isn't he? He should never grow up. Like that, they are so innocent, so pure. If only he were ours. - Veronica, we're both unmarried and if we suddenly appeared with a baby... Of course, there are places where he could grow up and see good examples around and be a man. No, not there. Later we could take him away and then nobody would think badly of us. No. It's better than not having a father and a mother who walks the streets alone at night like a whore. BABY CRIES Why have you put my suitcase outside? We want you to leave. He was crying. Well, that's nothing to worry about. It wasn't difficult to have this child, was it? No, of course it wasn't. Any bitch can do it. The important thing comes afterwards when you have to make sacrifices for the child. What do you know about it, to talk like that? I know enough, that you are not married and that you have deceived us all. If you abandon him now to walk the streets at night what will you do when he's a little older? Listen... Don't try to tell me what I should or shouldn't be doing and get out of my way. What do you think you're doing? Give me my child! Don't touch him! Your child! If he were ours we could give him a good home. Security is what he needs. What on Earth are you talking about? You heard her. A child needs good examples to follow and you couldn't even give him a father. You're both mad. Get out of the way! Give me my child! SHE GRUNTS SHE SHOUTS BABY CRIES SHE GRUNTS BABY CONTINUES CRYING Veronica, where are you? What are you doing? - This was in her bag. "Darling, I received your letter I cannot believe you want to go to London to get a divorce. I admit I've left you very much on your own for several months and that there is nothing sadder than loneliness but I love you both too much... you and the baby. She was married. She told the truth. Married... One of those marriages which isn't really a marriage at all. She wanted a divorce. Marta... That's not marriage! Everything we do has a reason, Veronica. I'm certain. There has to be a reason. Put more wood on the fire. BELL CHIMES "Lady in Space" by Klaus Wuesthoff Mansi√≥n Dos Hermanas, please. Hello? - Hello, may I speak to Norma, please? She doesn't live here anymore, she left this morning. What? Are you certain? - Of course. She left this morning. Who's calling, please? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? KNOCK ON DOOR Yes? - It's Laura. May I come in? Yes, of course. What's the matter? Norma's gone. I just phoned the hotel and they told me she left. Laura, who is Norma? She's the other girl at the hotel. She promised to tell me when she was leaving. Eduardo, I know something's wrong. Just a minute, what do you think is wrong? Don't you understand? First May, then Helen and now Norma! What are you thinking? We must report them to the police. Hold on, hold on. Go to the bar and wait. I'll be with you in a minute and we'll talk it over. You can't go to the police without proof. I'll find proof. I'll find something. DOG BARKS POLE CLATTERS Marta. What's wrong, Marta? DOG BARKS What are you doing? Somebody was in the kitchen. - Who? I don't know, I didn't see him. A thief? I heard footsteps, I'm sure. Give me this. Come on, let's go inside. LOCK CLICKS Did you leave the key in the lock? Answer me. Try to remember. I told you the key was always to be kept in the bedroom. What is it doing here? I don't know, Marta. Perhaps I forgot and left it in the kitchen. I don't know. But this... I don't know Marta. What's that jug doing there? Did you leave it there? You did leave it there. I told you never to take the wine from this jar. We've always taken wine from the others. This is the wine we always use to make the roast. Have you forgotten? - Maybe I made a mistake. I could make a mistake once but I don't think it's possible... - You made a mistake? Or did you do it on purpose? Did you also make a mistake when you forgot the key of the cellar door? Did you make a mistake, Veronica, or did you have another reason? No. No. I'm afraid, Marta. They'll find out about us. What we've done. It's horrible. It's the worst sin against God! SLAP THUDS - Never say that again! I'll leave you! You can leave right now if you like. I don't need you. But... we're murderers. We've killed them. We killed. My conscience was never more clear. Oh... Keep calm, Veronica. Your sister has always known what is best for you. Always remember that. Let's go up. They'll find out! If it was an act of evil, they'll find out. If it was an act for God's justice, we'll never be discovered. He will know what He must do. So what are you worried about? BIRDSONG Hello. It's been so long since you've come here. Look what I bought you. Put them on. They'll suit you. Luis... - Yes? I've come to bring you this. I don't want it. You are very pretty. This money is for you so that you can leave the village. A place far away... to Madrid. - Why? I don't want you to be here when... when everything happens. What is going to happen? You will promise? Will you go away? I want to go on seeing you. I want you to go! I don't want to see you again! Leave the village! Go away! INDISTINCT CHATTER INAUDIBLE CHATTER Beatriz, what's the matter? High blood pressure, must be high blood pressure. INDISTINCT CHATTER Quiet. Laura, sister of that harlot. Who can that man be? Her husband? I think I've seen him somewhere before... but I'm not sure. They're coming here. Surely she doesn't want a room again? Marta, maybe it was she who was in the house the other night? We're running a boarding house and we admit guests, don't we? Yes. - KNOCK ON DOOR Don't open it. Hello. My husband's just arrived and we'd like to stay here for a few days. Of course, come in. Did you hear from your sister? No, but she's probably back in London by now. Hello. I hope you'll be comfortable. If you need anything, please, call us. No. We won't need anything, thanks. Goodbye. Goodbye. - DOOR CLOSES That man, I think I've seen him before. But he's just arrived in the village. - So it would seem... but I never forget a face. Don't you think it's strange that girl has come back here? INDISTINCT CHATTER There's nothing to worry about, a simple infection which we've caught in time. There's always some danger with her heart which is not strong. But everything will be alright. I know she's alright, Doctor but I'm worried about the other thing. The one I found on the plate. What shall we do with that? I'll examine it carefully. I want to be certain. Should be about time now. They're bound to be all asleep. I'll be back. Don't you leave this room. I'll be back as soon as I can. BLOW THUDS - HE YELLS HE GRUNTS BODY THUDS SHE GASPS Is it true? - Yes. When my wife fainted, I picked it up from the plate without anyone seeing me. It has been saturated in alcohol for some time. By the colour of it, red wine. The eye of a woman. HER BREATH SHUDDERS LAURA GRUNTS That man was not your husband, was he? My sister doesn't want to hurt you, Laura. But who was this man? - Are you going to tell us? I'm afraid it's useless, Veronica.
