BEFORE I GO ANY FURTHER, I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THANK THE MAN WHO JUST INTRODUCED ME, A VERY SPECIAL INDIVIDUAL WHOSE RESEARCH AND TALENT WILL PROPEL MEDICAL SCIENCE OUT OF THE DARK AGES OF THE 20th CENTURY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DR. ARNOLD TARBUS. THANK YOU. CRUEL AS IT MAY SEEM IN TODAY'S WORLD, UNCONTRIVED GENEROSITY IS A WONDERFUL AND A RARE THING. WE ALL UNDERSTAND THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND. IT'S AN UNCOMPROMISING LAW, BUT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, SICKNESS AND DISEASE DO NOT RECOGNIZE A TAX BRACKET. THE WORLD WE LIVE IN SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD TO LOSE MEN'S VISION-- MEN THAT WILL LEAD US FORWARD. THE FUTURE OF OUR PLANET DEPENDS ON THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO WILL BE ABLE TO SHAPE IT. IN ORDER TO GIVE THOSE INDIVIDUALS POWER, SACRIFICES MUST BE MADE. BUT THESE ARE TOUGH TIMES WE'RE LIVING IN. DR. TARBUS? DR. TARBUS. [ mumbling ] OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. DR. TARBUS. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. DR. TARBUS. OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD. HOW YOU DOING, DOCTOR? YOU FEELING BETTER? [ slowly ] MUCH, THANK YOU. TIME TO GO BACK TO WORK. OH, NO. YOU TAKE TODAY OFF. NO, REALLY. THERE'S MUCH TO BE DONE... INDEED THERE IS, DOCTOR. THERE'S A LOT TO BE DONE. YOU RUN ALONG NOW. COME ON. I'M SORRY ABOUT ALL THIS, DARLIN'. THE DOCTOR FINDS IT DIFFICULT TO COPE AT TIMES. CAN'T YOU SEE HE'S KILLING HIMSELF? WELL, NOW, LET'S NOT BE CRITICAL OF OTHER PEOPLE'S IDIOSYNCRASIES. THE DOCTOR HAS HIS OWN WAY OF DEALING WITH THINGS, AND FOR THE MOST PART, IT SUFFICES. I'M GOING TO DRIVE HIM HOME. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. AND, SUGAR... WHEN YOU HAVE FINISHED TUCKING THE DOCTOR IN, I'D APPRECIATE IT IF YOU'D COME ON BACK HERE. OH, YOU NEED TO BE TUCKED IN, TOO? I WOULDN'T MIND. DR. TARBUS. DR. TARBUS. DR. TARBUS... [ chuckles ] Answering machine: HI, LOREN, IT'S US AGAIN. I JUST WANT TO ASK HOW YOU'RE DOING. YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND US IF YOU WANT TO TALK.

YEAH, I KNOW WHAT THEY ARE. MY FATHER-IN-LAW WAS A PROFESSOR. DON'T YOU MEAN CHAIRMAN OF THE HISTORY DEPARTMENT AT THE TAMALAN INSTITUTE? DID YOU STUDY WITH VICTOR? I TOOK HIS SEMINAR ON CONSTRUCTION TECHNIQUES AT CHICHEN ITZA. DID HE GIVE YOU A SEMINAR ON SMUGGLING THIS SHIT? [ sighs ] HE WAS A BRILLIANT MAN. BRILLIANT? WELL, HONEY, NOT THAT FUCKIN' BRILLIANT. HE GOT BUSTED ON SOME... BUM S&L LOAN JUST TO FINANCE SOME BULLSHIT POTTERY IN MEXICO. RYDER, THAT BULLSHIT POTTERY... WAS FOURTH-CENTURY MAYAN. PRESERVING ANTIQUITIES... IS OUR ONLY LINK TO THE SPIRITUAL PAST. HORSESHIT. GREAT ART HAS TO BE PROTECTED. WHAT IN THE HELL ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?! YOU KNOW WHAT IN THE HELL YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT? YOU DIDN'T KNOW HIM. AH, PROFESSOR CARRILLO. AW, SHUT UP! I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT HIM. I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT MY GODDAMN FATHER-IN-LAW. I WANT TO TALK ABOUT YOU. WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING WITH ME? WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU DOING AT MY PLACE? WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME? OKAY, THE SHOW'S OVER. THE HELL IT IS! OKAY, OKAY. JUST MAKE YOURSELF COMFORTABLE. WHOOPS.

MAYBE I'LL WORK OUT OF A MEAN MAR. HE'S A FAT SLOB NAMED JOE STOCKTON, WORKS WITH IMMIGRATION. I THINK, I HATE TO SAY IT, GUILLERMO WAS RUNNING ILLEGALS, AND THIS FAT-ASS STOCKTON WAS BLACKMAILING HIM OR SOMETHING OR PAYING HIM OFF. CAN YOU PUT A TAIL ON HIM? I CAN'T DO THAT. WHY THE HELL NOT? HE KNOWS ME. I CAN'T GO SNOOPING AROUND THE I.N.S., FOR FUCK'S SAKE. DID YOU LOVE HER, JACK? DID YOU REALLY LOVE HER, OR WAS IT JUST A GOOD IDEA? WE'LL TALK. KEN, I NEED THAT. WHAT? THAT. THIS? YEAH.

I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR MY POOR FLUFFY ALL DAY. SHE NEEDED TO TAKE HER MEDICINE. ARE YOU LOOKING FOR FLUFFY? OH, SHUT UP ABOUT THAT DAMN CAT. THERE IS NO CAT. WE GOT HER FOR MY SEVENTH BIRTHDAY. BUT YOU LEFT THE DOOR OPEN, AND SHE RAN AWAY. Man: THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, WHITE HOUSE, WASHINGTON, D.C... LET GO OF MY HAND. [ man laughing ] Woman: I SEE YOU.

WHERE'S YOUR HOME? HOME. NEAR THERE. WHERE'S YOUR HOME? ALL RIGHT. HOME IS JUST WHERE YOU GO... WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER PLACE TO GO. HOME IS WHERE YOU GO WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER PLACE TO GO. YEAH. WE'RE ON VACATION. WELL, THIS MIGHT BE A VACATION, BUT... SOMETHING YOU JUST SAID MADE IT MONDAY MORNING. HOME IS WHERE YOU GO WHEN YOU GOT NO PLACE ELSE TO GO? HOME IS WHERE YOU GO WHEN YOU GOT NO PLACE ELSE TO GO. I'M SORRY. NO, YOU'RE NOT. GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT. I GOT YOUR CALL. WHAT'S THE DEAL? THERE'S A KID IN THERE WHO CAN FINGER THE TWO GUYS WHO KILLED MY WIFE. SORRY. I'D LIKE TO HELP, BUT, UH, IT'S NOT MY PROBLEM. OH, YEAH? WHAT ABOUT JOE STOCKTON? HE'S SELLING THE ILLEGALS. THE SAME TWO GUYS THAT KILLED MY WIFE. HMM... WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THESE? OH, GOD. OH, GOD. I SAW A KID IN THE MORGUE THE OTHER DAY. HE WAS SLICED UP. THEY MADE IT LOOK LIKE A STABBING. SO? WHY'D THEY CUT OPEN A KID AND THEN TOSS HIM AWAY? I DON'T--I DON'T FOLLOW. HE HAD AN ALCOHOLIC LIVER. WHAT'S GOING ON? GET IN THE LINE. NICE OF YOU TO COME ON SUCH SHORT NOTICE. I NEEDED TO TALK TO YOU ANYWAY. ABOUT WHAT? THERE'S GOING TO BE TROUBLE AT THE CLINIC. WE'RE FALLING BEHIND. THE TURNAROUND'S TOO QUICK. IT'S GETTING CONFUSING. THERE'S GOING TO BE A SCREW-UP, I CAN FEEL IT. I THINK WE BETTER CLOSE DOWN BEFORE IT BACKFIRES. WAIT A MINUTE, DOCTOR, JUST HOLD ON. BE SPECIFIC. HOW CAN I POSSIBLY HELP YOU IF YOU'RE GONNA BABBLE OBSCURITIES? THERE WAS A VISITOR AT THE CLINIC. SO? HE WAS ONLY THERE FOR A MOMENT, BUT NURSE BAUER THOUGHT HE WAS STRANGE. STRANGE? A MAN WALKS INTO THE LOBBY OF A CLINIC, NURSE BAUER SEES HIM, THINKS HE'S STRANGE, AND YOU WANNA BAIL OUT? WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU, DOCTOR? ARE YOU NEGLECTING YOUR MEDICATION? ONE THING I'VE LEARNED IN MY LIFE ON THIS PLANET IS TO WATCH MY INSTINCTS, AND MY INSTINCTS TELL ME THINGS ARE WAY OUT OF LINE. WAIT A MINUTE, YOU LISTEN TO ME. THERE ARE MUCH LARGER ISSUES AT STAKE THAN YOUR INSTINCTS, DOCTOR. YOU ARE A PROFESSIONAL MAN. YOU'RE BEING HIGHLY COMPENSATED FOR YOUR SERVICES. YOU WOULDN'T WANT ME TO THINK YOU WERE UNGRATEFUL, WOULD YOU? NO. GOOD, GOOD. THEN LET'S JUST FORGET ABOUT ALL THIS. LET'S GET BACK TO WORK. MATTER OF FACT, WE GOT A LITTLE RUSH ORDER FOR YOU. WHAT? PACKAGE MUST BE AT THE EMBASSY NO LATER THAN 8:00 TOMORROW MORNING. IMPOSSIBLE. YOU NEVER SAY THAT WORD IN MY PRESENCE, DOCTOR. WE DO NOT KNOW THE MEANING OF THAT WORD. NOW, YOU GET YOUR ASS BACK TO THE CLINIC, AND YOU CALL ME WHEN EVERYTHING'S READY, YOU HEAR? YEAH. RICARDO? RICARDO? SEÑOR HART. ¿ESTáS BIEN? SORRY, PAL. TOO LATE. HA HA HA. THE KID COMES WITH ME. NO, HE DOESN'T. DROP THE PIECE! I DON'T THINK SO. WELL, WELL, WELL... IF IT ISN'T TWO OF MY FAVORITE PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE WORLD. HA. WHAT WE'VE GOT OURSELVES HERE IS A-- PARDON THE EXPRESSION-- HA, MEXICAN STAND-OFF. SWEETHEART, IF YOU DON'T PUT THAT GUN DOWN AND MOVE AROUND THAT COUNTER, FOUR PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DIE, AND I AM NOT GONNA BE ONE OF THEM. ALL RIGHT. I'LL TAKE THE SPIC. YOU DO THEM. CHRISTIAN SAID OTHERWISE. HE DID? WHAT EXACTLY DID THE ARYAN ASSHOLE HAVE TO SAY? HE SAID FOR ME TO DELIVER THE KID. FIRST I DO... EVERYBODY. [ gunshot ] SHE'S DEAD! RICARDO, FIND JEFF. GO. TELL HIM TO MEET ME AT THE CLINIC, AL CLíNICA. ¿ENTIENDES? AFUERA, AFUERA! YOU LISTEN TO ME. WHO KILLED MY WIFE? FUCK YOU! YOU ARE GUT-SHOT, BUDDY, AND YOU'RE GONNA DIE ANYWAY, BUT NOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE BLIND. WHO KILLED HER?! I WAS HERE... WITH CHRISTIAN. HUHH! UHH! Doctor: [ echoing ] THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE. I WILL NOT DO THIS! HIS LIVER IS PROBABLY ALREADY DAMAGED. HIS BLOOD ALCOHOL LEVEL IS OUTRAGEOUS! IT DOESN'T MATTER. WE NEED HIS HEART AND LIVER NOW. HIS BLOOD ISN'T EVEN COMPATIBLE WITH THE RECIPIENT'S. THE ORGANS WILL BE REJECTED. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE ORIGINAL DONOR? LOOK, THESE ORGANS ARE BOUGHT AND PAID FOR. NOW, TAKE HIS CLOTHES OFF, OPEN HIM UP, AND CUT THEM OUT. [ monitor beeping ] Woman: HE STILL ISN'T UNDER, DOCTOR. ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET HIS CLOTHES OFF. GIVE HIM 10 MILLIGRAMS OF DIAZEPAM. I.V. PUSH, WIDE OPEN. HE'S ALREADY SO SATURATED WITH TOXINS. OH, SHUT UP! WATCH HIS BREATHING! YOU REALIZE THIS IS PROBABLY GONNA KILL HIM TOO SOON. DO IT! [ doctor screaming ] [ doctor whimpering ] [ gunshot ] [ rustling ] [ door opens ] [ sizzling ] AAH! RYDER HART. SUCH A PLEASURE TO FINALLY GET A FORMAL INTRODUCTION. AFTER ALL, WE HAVE SO MANY MUTUAL FRIENDS. I'M TOLD YOU'RE TERRIBLE WITH THOSE THINGS. I'M SURE YOU HAD NO IDEA YOU WERE DOING ANYTHING WRONG. AND THAT WAS A MISTAKE. BIG MISTAKE. SEE, I KNEW ALL ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH MR. HART. CHRISTIAN TOLD ME EVERYTHING. DARLING, YOU JUST DIDN'T THINK. YOU DID NOT THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT HE IS ENDANGERING EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND EXTREMELY HUMANE WORK. NOW...[ sighs ] I KNOW THAT YOU NEED CERTAIN THINGS IN YOUR LIFE, AND I WANT YOU TO HAVE THEM, I WANT YOU TO ENJOY THEM... BUT NOT AT THE EXPENSE OF EVERYTHING WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. I KNOW IT MAY SEEM UNFAIR, BUT EVERYTHING IN THIS WORLD HAS A PRICE, SUGAR, AND EVENTUALLY WE ALL HAVE TO PAY. YOU GOT WHAT YOU WANTED, DIDN'T YOU? HMM? Shelgrove: WE HAVE A HELICOPTER WAITING, I ASSURE YOU... THE DOCTOR PROMISED TO CALL ME AS SOON AS THEY APPRAISED HIM. YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW AND I SHARED A COMMON PASSION, MR. HART. THE AZTECS. YOU KNOW, THE AZTECS WERE A SUPERIOR PEOPLE, BUT IT WAS THE MAYANS-- OH, YES, THE MAYANS-- THEY WERE THE ONES WHO WERE PURE GENIUS. SO INCREDIBLY ADVANCED IN ASTRONOMY AND MATHEMATICS. AND YET, YOU KNOW, THE STRANGE THING IS, FROM WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THEIR ENGINEERING, THEY DIDN'T HAVE ANY IDEA ABOUT THE WHEEL. TOTALLY ELUDED THEM. WASN'T EVEN IN THEIR VOCABULARY. ISN'T THAT AMAZING? A CIVILIZATION LIKE THAT WITHOUT A WHEEL? THAT'S TOTALLY UNFATHOMABLE. VICTOR WAS BRINGING YOU ALL THIS STUFF ALL THESE YEARS, WASN'T HE? ONLY THING THEY LEFT BEHIND WAS THEIR HOUSES, A FEW PYRAMIDS, AND SOME ODDS AND ENDS. BUT, YOU KNOW, ONE INTERESTING THEORY ABOUT THE MAYANS IS THAT THEY JUST COULDN'T SUPPORT THEIR OWN EXPANSION. THEY GOT TOO BIG. IT'S LIKE A BUILDING THAT BECOMES TOO TALL FOR ITS OWN FOUNDATION AND COLLAPSES IN ON ITSELF. YOU KNOW, WE'VE SEEN THAT HAPPEN WITH CERTAIN CIVILIZATIONS, AND I CAN TELL YOU THIS... UNLESS WE DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT, IT COULD HAPPEN TO CONTEMPORARY WESTERN SOCIETY AS WELL. INCIDENTALLY, YOUR FATHER-IN-LAW SHARED THAT NOTION. I DON'T THINK HE QUITE SHARED YOUR NOTION OF THE PRACTICAL APPLICATION, SHELGROVE. WELL, YOU KNOW, VICTOR HAD A NOSE FOR HIDDEN TREASURE, BUT HE JUST DIDN'T HAVE THE STOMACH FOR ITS LEGACY. HE REALLY THOUGHT YOU WERE FINDING THEM JOBS, DIDN'T HE? AND HE REALLY BELIEVED YOU WERE GETTING THEM WORK. VICTOR, HA HA. HE HAD A MAGNANIMOUS BUT FUTILE WAY OF DEALING WITH THE FATE OF HIS RACE. WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO IS PREVENT THAT FATE FROM DESTROYING THIS CIVILIZATION. YOU'RE INSANE. HISTORY IS DETERMINED BY INDIVIDUALS, MR. HART. WE'VE ALL HEARD THAT ONE, SHELGROVE, LIKE POL POT IS HISTORY AND TWO MILLION CAMBODIANS AIN'T. SOME PEOPLE ARE BORN WITH THEIR DESTINY. SOME PEOPLE LEARN ABOUT THEIR DESTINY... AND SOME PSYCHO HAS GOT IT THRUST UPON HIM. YEAH, I READ THAT PLAY. THE FUNCTION OF SOCIETY, MR. HART, IS TO SUBORDINATE THE WORKER TO THE ELITE. WHEN THE ELITE BECOME SUBORDINATE TO THE WORKER, THE PYRAMID BECOMES TOP-HEAVY, AND EVERYTHING JUST CRASHES DOWN. YOU CUT OUT THEIR HEARTS ALIVE, SHELGROVE! WELL, NOW, THE AZTECS RIPPED OUT A THOUSAND HEARTS IN ONE DAY IN A CELEBRATION OF LIFE. OH, GOD. AND THE ONCE-MIGHTY MAYANS OF THE YUCATAN-- LOOK AT 'EM NOW. I MEAN, JUST LOOK AT 'EM. THEY'RE SNEAKIN' ACROSS THE BORDER DESPERATELY SEARCHIN' FOR PEANUTS. JESUS CHRIST! AM I GOIN' NUTS HERE?! I THOUGHT I'D HEARD ALL THE "GREATER GOOD" BULLSHIT, BUT, BROTHER, YOU ARE THE LIVIN' END. MY WIFE IS DEAD, SHELGROVE. I NEVER KNEW YOUR WIFE. EXACTLY. YOU'RE ABOUT AS USEFUL TO SOCIETY... AS A HOLE IN A RIVERBOAT. AND I THINK I'M GONNA PUT THAT HOLE WHERE IT'S GONNA DO EVERYBODY A WHOLE LOT OF GOOD. WELL... THERE, YOU SEE, MR. HART? THIS WHOLE THING IS CLEARLY BEYOND YOUR LIMITED SCOPE. BUT I SUPPOSE THAT'S A MOOT POINT BY NOW. ADIOS, AMIGO. IT'S BEEN A TRIVIAL PLEASURE KNOWING YOU. DO THE RIGHT THING, SUGAR. AAH! GODDAMN. GODDAMN. HOW LONG DID YOU WORK FOR HIM? I DIDN'T WORK FOR SHELGROVE. I WAS INDENTURED TO HIM. THAT LADDER GOES SO FAR OVER HIS HEAD... CAN'T EVEN SEE THE TOP. DID YOU KNOW HE WAS KILLING THESE PEOPLE? DID YA? DID YA TAKE YOUR JOB THAT SERIOUSLY? IF I TOOK MY JOB SERIOUSLY, RYDER... DO YOU THINK YOU'D EVEN BE HERE TO ASK ME THAT QUESTION? A GIFT. LIKE YOU SAID, VACATION'S OVER. [ engine revs ] Loren: POR FAVOR, MOVE THE TRUCK, PLEASE. [ engine revs ] POR FAVOR,THE TRUCK! MOVE THE TRUCK, PLEASE! POR FAVOR! [ horn beeping ] [ engine revving ] [ sustained beep ] [ revving and beeping stop ] BUENOS DíAS. IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY TO BE ALIVE. YES. GOD SEND THE WIND IN TO CLEAN UP THE AIR. BLESSED SANTA ANA. DID YOU KNOW HE'D HAVE TO KILL HIMSELF? WHAT? I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE HELL YOU'RE TALKIN' ABOUT. YOU DON'T, HUH? THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER BEEN TO MEXICO, JEFF. THE S&L LOAN AIN'T WHY HE KILLED HIMSELF, JEFF! I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ILLEGALS! BULLSHIT. VICTOR WAS ALWAYS TRYING TO HELP THE ILLEGALS GET WORK. GUILLERMO WOULD FIND THEM, AND VICTOR WOULD PLACE THEM. YOU KNEW THAT! YEAH, I KNEW IT. ALL I ASKED WAS FOR HIM TO KEEP ME OUT OF IT. HE COULD HAVE GONE TO THE POLICE AND KEPT ME OUT OF IT! YOU WERE THE POLICE, JEFF! YOU WERE THE POLICE! YOU WERE HIS FAMILY, AND YOU WERE THE POLICE, FELLA, BUT YOU SURE AS HELL COULD HAVE FOOLED ME, MAN! ALWAYS FASHIONABLY LATE! YOU BLOW A SIMPLE FUCKIN' SURVEILLANCE! YOU MUST HAVE REALLY PISSED IN YOUR PANTS WHEN YOU THREW ME THOSE BAR CODES BEFORE I THREW 'EM IN THE TRASH. WHAT THE HELL WERE YOU HOPIN' FOR, THAT I'D GET EVEN WITH HER AND GET MY ASS CARVED IN THE PROCESS? I MEAN, YOU COULD HAVE LET EVERYBODY OFF THE HOOK HERE, BROTHER, INCLUDING ME, 'CAUSE I'VE BEEN CARRYING THIS FUCKING AGONY AROUND WITH ME LIKE A GODDAMN WET MATTRESS! SAVED HER?! GODDAMN, YOU KILLED HER, MAN! I KNOW. I KNOW. WHERE WERE YOU, RYDER? WHERE THE FUCK WERE YOU? THAT'S RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT. I WAS DRUNK. I'LL BE DOWNSTAIRS. SHIT, YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT. YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT! YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT! GIVE ME THAT! YOU ARE NOT GONNA LEAVE ME WITH THAT. [ man speaking Spanish ] MUCHAS GRACIAS. MARIA, POR ALLá.
