Put your phones aside and listen to me. Smoking leads to cancer and can be fatal. Consumption of alcohol is injurious to health. Hey you in seat number 7! Did you listen to that? Savithri! Are you playing games with death? No, Yamadharma Raja! To save my husband's life... I'm going to test my morale... No morale can withstand fate... Sorry to differ, Yamadharma Raja! If we think so... There's no scope for human effort. Not just that... Someday death is inevitable. Don't you know that? Despite knowing the fact, didn't you grow up and live life? All the efforts... Did you accept the fate of death to do all these? Or to delay it for a while... [Hindu prayers] [Hindu prayer continues] [Chirstian prayers] [Chirstian prayer continues] [Hindu prayers] [baby crying] -Wake up, you lazy people! -Who threw water on us? Can't you hear the baby crying her heart out? Wake Up! [calming the baby] From now on... If your parents don't wake up... Piss on their face... That's the best wake-up call for them! There's your mom. Calm down son, sleep my baby. [traditional chants] Let's go, fast! Field's gonna dry up.. The prayers are done in the temple too. [folk song] [folk song continues] Happy Marriage Day, Mom & Dad! We didn't remember our marriage day! How did you people do it? In search of our old books in the wooden box... we found your marriage card. Mom! GrandFather's stuff was also there in that box. Never touch his box again! Hey! I'm gonna count to 3... Okay! If you are coming out from there... Or else, I'm gonna lash you all! No one's gonna ask me anything for hitting you... Go, Jamma! Who's gonna fear you? How dare you! [kids humming folk song] [kids humming folk song] [devotional song playing in temple] [music playing on loud speakers] Yes! Great music! It summed up to 1000/- The shopkeeper wants you to clear the debt... To lend more money further... Nonsense! Tell him that I'll pay it by Shivaratri! Half of it was borrowed to feed you right? If we sell one of your goat right now.. We can clear off our total debt! It's a Show! You lost again, give me my money! [temple bell rings] Hey! Looks like she came. -What about my money? -I'll give it later, let's go now! -Who's the priest here? -It's me. -You! -Yeah. Why are you not ready for the daily ritual? No one visits here, except on Mondays. -So... -Ok. I'll go perform the ritual. You go brush your teeth. Who's that? Oh... It's her. Hello, that's mine. It's you who distributed holy food until today. But for the first time you are on the receiving end. You filled the absence of a monkey, Shankar. Idiot! [boy giggling] Who's she? I never saw her around. She's the daughter of the new priest to Lord Rama's temple. Wow! Is it? Everyone is saying that the new priest is really great at this work. Lord Rama is getting a lot of following these days. Who will visit Lord Shiva, who's already on a hill? If this continues our Lord's situation is difficult. I don't know how will you pay me back, or the merchant from the village? She's beautiful, right Shankar? Hope she visits everyday. May that wish come true. Don't act as if you own the field or something? Bloody... Why did you break the barrier? Because I simply don't care. No! -What happened? -How dare he mess with me? -Bloody! -Don't mess with me again. God! Rascal! I'll prescribe a tablet... Everything will be ok by evening. -Will he be ok? -Better to show him in Vizag hospital. Mom... Sister... She... She... Pushpa hit puberty, sister. You are late! Hey, get inside. Move. -Get in. -What happened? -It's your own brother's family, right? -Don't you know what happened? Shanti, put her the bindi. Lakshmi, the bangles. Sir, that girl is here again. "How can I take my eyes off you..." "in any direction?" "How can I hold back my steps..." "even for a moment?" "You come here along with me to give myself back to me" "As soon as you leave I am not myself anymore I become you" [humming] [humming] [humming] [humming] "What can I say if you ask me why I was born?" "I am scared you might get mad at me if I say I was born for you" "What can I say if you ask me whom do I like?" "I am scared you might hit me if I say it's you" "Not able to... Not able to say it to you..." "I remained as a love letter" "You come here along with me to give myself back to me" "I might become like you" Will you complete the ritual or should I break the phone? -Please don't. -Complete the ritual first! -Tastes good? -Yeah... By the way... Why are you always here? Won't you come into the village? I used to be in the village when my father was alive. We were the only priests in this village. I in my childhood... I used to roam, watch movies, play cards, drink, smoke & do more with the villagers. My father used to scold me everytime... Questioning my ethnicity! After my father passed away... I had to work as a priest in this Temple... It's so nice here! Do you know? No one stays back here! We can be according to our wish! This hill... That Forest... The cool breezes all the time... The plain green fields around... Those villages... These lakes... Shankar and his goats... You see, that graveyard... Everything's visible from here. Time flies yet it never feels bored here. Yeah, it never feels bored here... "How can I take my eyes off you..." "in any direction?" "How can I hold back my steps..." "even for a moment?" "You come here along with me to give myself back to me" "As soon as you leave I am not myself anymore I become you" [humming] [continues to hum] You lost again kid! Hey, give me that! Are you giving it or not? -Mom! -Hey... Hands up! Both hands! Sprinkle the water on your head... Stop Crying! If you come here ever again.. I'll cut your bell off... Get Out! Pushpa... Be Careful. House is filled with objects! If band people, folk singers, cooks and others, give them advance... Tell them we'll close it once the function is wrapped up! If they ask anything else.. Tell them to talk to me. Okay, Mom! Shall we start? Hey! I won't play with you if you don't play fair now! Excuse me, Mister! Where is Surya Rao's home? Is it Sillangi (black magic) Surya Rao? Go Straight... Take Right... The building beside the school. Look, how's he gawking. Shillangi (black magic) fellow! He ogled at all the village kids in the same way! Idiot... The hell with him. [on radio] He's the lion of Rayalaseema... Samara Simha Reddy! -Brother how are you? -How the function happened well? It happened well sister-in-law. Take this gift! You didn't come to my daughter's wedding but you want me to take the money? I won't take the money... Hey, it wasn't intentional... The same day, menarche happened to your daughter-in-law! That's the only reason. Oh! That's good news then.. My brother-in-law is going to feed us all with meat curries... Oh yes, you can feast on it... First, take this gift money... -Santhi... -Yes, Dad! Bring that diary to note down the gift amount... It's 3000/- Note down, it's 3000/- You're very kind, brother! Even our own relatives didn't help us out! What's so kind in this sister-in-law... It's just like mutual savings. I will help out for an occasion in your home. And vice versa. This tradition won't favor just one person right? Our ancestors started this tradition with a lot of foresee... Or else, without everyone's help... Can we celebrate such occasions by spending lakhs of rupees! One flower from each hand can make a garland for the diety! Well said, Jayamma! We shall leave brother! Get down. We're not going into town. How can you ask 50/- change for a 5/-bill? We only have that with us... You agreed to drop us at the Bus Stand. I'll miss my serial, sister. Sister! Sister! Sister! Sorry Sister, I agree my mistake. The key! I'll drop u at the bus stand, please! Pull your Auto till the bus stand... Agreed my mistake sister, come sit.. I'll take you to the bus stand. If you repeat it again.. I'll throw you and your Auto in the lake... [crowd sloganeering] Did it happened ever, before? One time he had a burning sensation in his chest. Local doctor medicines used to give him temporary relief. Look here... This is our heart... Look at this valve inside... They call it Mitral valve... This isn't working well for your husband... That's the reason for the pain in his heart. We have to perform surgery and change it immediately... Okay Sir! How much would the surgery cost? It would cost 4 lakhs. We don't have any other alternative. In how many days? You still think there's time left? It shouldn't be delayed even for one more day! With such a weak heart, he's still alive... That's your pure luck! It's already too late... 4 lakhs is a big amount, Jayamma! What do you have to lend for surety? Your house is already in finance right? You don't even have a land or property too... Can't help. Please help me out this one time, brother. Somehow, I'll pay you back. No, Jayamma. I can't hand that kind of money, just like that. You haven't paid your last loan. And the interest too. -Ok, brother. I'll leave. -Have some tea. -Bring some tea. -It's ok. I'll pay you the old loan soon! Look if he's around. No, he isn't. Rotate it! I'm rotating it faster than you. It's just like a cycle tyre. He's here. -Where's Vijay? -No idea! How can we get 4 lakhs right now? Leave it, let the fate decide. Sister, I have to attend another function, I cannot attend this. Register my gift money. Sure brother. Where is your mom? Mother, Janaki aunt is here. Why all these now? It is nothing before what you gifted us. Jayamma! Do my brother needs a heart surgery? Did you get an estimation from doctors? It might cost us up to 4 lakhs. 4 lakhs? We got all the problems at once. Girl's function on one side and... On the other side, her father is on bed, It is very difficult Jayamma. Why don't you go with a simple function? Nothing like that, I think we are in a problem, but there is a way out too. I will use the gift money from girl's function for my husband's surgery. All of this seems like God's plan. Jayamma! Jayamma! I will return it by evening. What's the hurry? Return after the event. -Did you bless the child? -No, I wanted to meet you. Seems everyone is here. We have a lot of things to do. Let's go. -Hey, Jamma. -Jamma? My name is Indu Kumar. Peel the skin. Peel it, brother is asking. President, see this... He is eating more than what he is peeling. [traditional chants] Sister! Priest is good at performing rituals, right? He is giving all the prasadam to us. Our Shiva temple's priest is not doing a good job. He doesn't even know any mantras. What is this? He is eating all the prasadam even before completing the ritual. Hello, tell me Anitha. I'm in the middle of a ritual. I'm performing archana. Babu, please complete the ritual first You can talk on the phone later. Be on hold. [traditional chants] Put this flower on the idol. Hail Lord Shiva! Keep your fingers on nose. Done. Put some money and leave. What's wrong? He completed the ritual without even reading the... mantras properly and went on talking on the phone. [voice muted] Are these the songs to be played in fornt of God? Only lord Shiva can save Babu from this girl. Take medicine dear. Why are you looking like that? You are quite beautiful Jaya! I do know that. Take this. Don't strain yourself Settle down once you bless the girl. Ask Shravanthi if you need anything. [band playing] "You and me both are wings" "Let's become one and fly away" "The star lit sky is ours" "Music will play where ever we are" "Isn't this feeling great?" "Time stood still" "This world belongs to us from here on" "Let's enjoy and have a great time" "You and me both are wings" "Let's become one and fly away" "The star lit sky is ours" "Music will play where ever we are" "Isn't this feeling great?" "Time stood still" "This world belongs to us from here on" "Let's enjoy and have a great time" Yesu! We didn't talk till now right? Yes Pushpa, Even though we are in the same street... I could not connect with you. But during last year Shivaratri, Jagadi said you are the most beautiful girl in the village. I saw you for the first time then. I don't know why Yesu, This never happened earlier, All the boys in my class are looking at me recently. Am I really that beautiful? Beautiful? You will be 1st, 2nd, and 3rd if there is a beauty competition in our school. Do you like Jesus Christ? Oh! Is it about my name? I was born when my mom's watching Jesus Christ's screen show. So, they named me Yesu Babu. Yesu, will you teach me cycle? It's just a cycle you are asking as if it is an aeroplane, Pushpa Most of us will get injured while learning cycle. I will make sure, you won't get hurt. -Really? -Yes! Don't worry Pushpa, I and this Goddess will make sure you won't get hurt. "No need to be scared..." -Let's go. -"No need to worry" "Don't worry, you don't have a school bag on you too" "Don't get nervous, there is no scarcity of what so ever" "Don't you worry about your studies" "There are no boundaries to play" Aren't they Jayamma's daughter and Jaggarao's son? I will see their end Yesu Your father is coming in search of you. Yesu, Jammadu will say so, don't leave me. Hey! I was kidding. Why will your father come here now? He might have got drunk by now. Hey Jamma Next time I'll get you. I will make a dent in your head. Who is Jamma? I'm Indu Kumar. [metal clanks] Sorry, Pushpa. I wanted to teach you cycle without getting you injured. This is all because of Jammadu. It's okay Yesu, it's a small injury, leave it. Yesu, See that lotus... They are beautiful right? "Time stood still" [water splashed] "This world belongs to us from here on" "Let's enjoy and have a great time" Hey Jamma... Why are you eating everything? That is for people who drink. Is it written on the chicken uncle? You won't change. Shiva! Check how much did Jayamma gifted us? Do they taste good? -Eat without any shyness, ok? -Here... Write the names properly. Count the gift money carefully. How's the food uncle? - Didn't your wife come? - She ate and took some food as well! If there's any event in the village, these old people don't even light the stove for a week. Ignore Jammada, food is delicious dear. Did you take my Ladoo Jamma? -You would have ate it. -Swamy, come here! Put 2 ladoos for grandpa. Pala Apparao, will you come on a bike for sambar as well? Write fast... Keep up with them. -Faster. -Gopi... [commotion] See how this bugger is looking at my child. God! Black Magic Suri is here. Give it here. Shiva, I am gifting 500. Who's son are you? Why are you standing here? Go have lunch Take it. Give me 2 more. How many will you eat old man? Gopi, write my name. Jagga Rao 3000. Gopi, He didn't pay the money. Jagga Rao uncle... Money? -I'm giving the gift money to Gopi. -Ok, sister. -Me too. -Bye! Why all of you are leaving at once? Drink some tea and leave. My daughter is alone at home I have to leave before it's late. Okay. Visit again when you are free. I will send some sweets. -Bye. -Okay sister. Aunty.. Total collection 77,296 rupees. -How much? -77,296 rupees... -70? -7,296 rupees. What's gotten into them? We distributed 500 cards. Fed 1000 people. Not even 200 people gave the gift money. How could they do this? Ate stomach full yet no one showed the courtesy of giving gift money. How much gift money was collected Gopi? 77,296 rupees... Oh my... Such an idiots they are... Sum of my gift money to only 10-15 people would be around 1 lakh rupees. Such deeds of yours brought us to this stage today... You consider whole villagers as your relatives. No one's gonna return the favor in gratitude. How much gift money did you give to Singapuram Appalanaidu's function? 2000. He didn't even attend our function. How much did you gift your Aunt daughter function? Check how much did they give us... 1,116 Aunty! That's how it is... You gave 30 grams of gold to your brother's daughter's marriage. He gave nothing! You try to be so kind... what did you gain now? You have a disease on a side and daughters on the other side... Because of you, we can't even get the needs of the Kids now... How would I guess these Idiots actions? What can we do now? They'll suffer the fate.. Leave them... You want me to let them go? I don't believe in fate and karma I know what to do! Everyone, whom we didn't miss to give has to give us the gift money. Here it is sister, my gift money... You didn't come for the feast Dama? I did sister but forgot the gift money at home. Write down his father's name... How much gift money was received sister? What can I say Dama... Didn't even get 1 lakh. What? Not even 1 lakh? The whole village thinks that Jayamma will get 5-6 lakhs of gift money. Yeah, it ended in thought level... Such an ungrateful people they're. Oh God.. Okay Sister... I didn't even give tea to my husband will come again later. Let's go... Whoever hasn't given the gift money write down their names in the evening. Okay Aunty! Who would have given this? It's for the first time... I'm seeing someone who's reading at the temple People keep offering coconuts to god to get them passed in return. They keep on praying for the same... And offer rituals to god but won't give any efforts in personal. It's so peaceful here. Reading 1 hour here equals 10 hours at home. What are you studying now? I'm preparing for bank exams. Do you like a bank job so much? No, but I love counting money. Ohh.. Is it? Wait a minute... What happened? I just said it casually... Just wait a minute, I'll be back. -Here... Hold it! -What's this? Look into it once... Count them now... 5 paise... 10 paise... They aren't worth anymore, right? That's why our villagers offered them to God. Yesu! I asked the photographer to click you too now, even you will be in my pics Oh, that's the reason he kept on capturing me often. I feared it, imagining something else Pushpa. Pushpa! Here, take my gift. Wow, Silver anklets? They're pretty good, Yesu! Thank God, You liked it luckily! I was in a doubt about the same... By the way, how did you have money for these? Need to give more 60 rupees. I only have those sir, adjust with them for now. What did you say? I should adjust with them? [mobile ringing] Hello! Hello! Brother... Jayamma speaking... Yeah, tell me Jayamma! How are you brother? I'm fine now.. Why didn't you attend my daughter's function? I thought of starting early in the morning... But I couldn't! How did the function go? By god's grace... everything went good brother. Brother... Gift Money? What did you ask? Like.. You didn't send the gift money, right? I told you I couldn't make it right? What's bothering you so much now? You have the younger daughter right? To her function... I'll give the gift money combinedly. Good god... You didn't say you would do it on her marriage We can discuss about the future later... Send this gift money first.. Did you lose your mind Jayamma? What nonsense are you talking? Is this some kind of debt or what? People will give it according to heir will and wish. Does anyone call and demand gift money like this? Cut the call, and never call me again. I won't cut your debt until you pay me 20 rupees. How many times will you call? Do you think I don't have any work? Don't shout like a dog, even I can shout. In your daughters function I took all the... responsibilities And gifted a good amount of money... did you forget? You neither attended my daughter's function... nor gifted the money. Up on that you are abusing me! If it was you, will you let it go? Will you leave even an interest of 25 paise on debts? What will you do now? If you don't send it by tomorrow I will come and collect the gift money If you lose your fame, don't blame it on me! I warn you. Nothing like that Jayamma, please listen to me! What is this nonsense? This isn't working Nobody is paying while asking politely. Where did you go? I went to Vishalamma's home, mother. Is it? Why didn't Vishalamma gave the gift money yet? Alright! Go and change the dress. You have to wear this to story night too. Okay mother. We are thankful to Gowra Naidu and Jayamma for the opportunity. Our troop is thanking them once again. Brother-in-law... -Let's start? -Yeah. We should start the story in a new way. How bro? Look that little girl in the crowd is crying. -Yeah. -Little girl... We should pamper that kid How? [singing a ryhme] Kumari Chanchu Lakshmi story telling group... Indu Kumar, Jammadu in bracket, is blessing us... With Rs. 300... Who mentioned Jammadu beside my name? Ralla Appana Naidu 200 rupees.

Challa Tirupathi Rao 300 rupees. Greetings, everyone... As every one of us is here, I want to say this. You all attended the feast and had food, it is good. But only some of you gifted us, Those who didn't gift the money Please give it within 2 days. I have an important work at home. Why Jayamma is asking for gifts like this? Do you have to get onto the stage just for that? Will anyone demand the gifts like this? Jamma! You have money to bless Chanchu Lakshmi... But you ate like a pig and have no money to gift us, right? She destroyed my dignity. -I will give it by tomorrow! -Will see. I know how to get my gift money from you. Get it started. [singing] [Hindu prayers] [Christian prayers] What are these people doing here? God! Look, don't perform prayers in our village. Except for one or 2 families all are Hindus here. We are feeling uncomfortable due to your Christian prayers You can build a church here but don't do prayers on the streets. We will not go against your will. Even we are looking for a place, We are not finding one. Build one when you find one, But stop prayers on the streets. -Mind you! -Okay! Keep Riding... Yeah, That's it... That's it! Hurray! Satya! Yeah! -I need to tell you something... -Yes, Tell me! [temple bell] I think somebody's here... I'll come back again... It's okay, tell me.. It's okay, I'll come back again. Who the hell has come at this time? Hello, Jayamma! I'm calling from the hospital... Your medicine and checkup rates have summed up to 20,000rs, The doctor has insisted you to arrange them too... Tell the doctor, I'll arrange the money in 2 days... Jaya..! Jaya..! Why did you sell the bull? Bring that money! -Try to understand... -No more discussions... Bring that money.. Give it to him and send him away... Don't you dare sell the bulls again! Bloody life... I don't care even if I lose it... You don't care even if you lose life? If you die? Should I clean & wash in others homes to get our daughters married? Dying is easy... Leading life with responsibilities is tough Move. Tell me whose name is on the list from this street? -Did they give? -No, they haven't... -Did they give? -No, they haven't... Aunty... Look. Jayammaa...! How did your daughter's function go? Yeah, it went well brother. Why didn't you attend the function? Went to city to attend my relatives function... Seems like very close relatives... Okay, whatever... Why didn't you gift the money brother? -Gift money? -Yeah. Will give in the morning... You seem exhausted, go inside and rest well... I don't have much work to do... I'll sit right here till the morning... God! How much did she gift us? 2000rs. 2000rs?! Dad, what are you doing? They were saved for a purpose... We can deal with it later... "She is a bit arrogant..." "She is a true village woman at heart" "She shines above all any where" "We are just flies compared to her arrogance" "She is Jayamma... Jayamma... Jayamma..." "She looks like adamant Suryakanthamma" "What has happened is a different story" "But she is good at heart" Jayamma... Here, take your gift money... Give back my money box. -You said you didn't have the money? -"She is furious but she is like a child" You should have that conscience earlier... Got it! "Only God should know why she is like this" "She fires up like a cracker she speaks straight" "If she starts talking the world get's muted" "She'll get angry just like that" "And she cools down just like that" Stop there... Call your brother in hyderabad... Hello, what happened Jayamma? You didn't attend my daughter's function? You should've sent the gift money, at least! So, what now? Your tractor won't move till you send the gift money. Huh? What nonsense is this? Hey, Appalraju... This is what you're doing here? Went to your home for gift money... Okay, give me the gift money. We earn and save a little... Do you want to spend it on gambling? Go to your homes. Hey, Apparao... Take this... Take this money for milk you've given for my daughter's function. Aunty, that guy stays nearby here.. Pandit... Where's the gift money? He'll give it by Shivaratri, Jayamma! Oh! So, you are the leader here? Hey, Gopi! Jayammaa! Jayammaa... I don't even know if he's gonna give the gift money or not... Why are you taking away my goat? My people will bash me if they know this... I'll definitely give it in 2 days... If he doesn't give the money in 2 days consider your goat is gone... Give it back Gopi. [Telugu song playing on radio] Hey, you old man! Do you have any shame, dignity, or self-respect? Is this gift money or some donation to a beggar? Since last 20 years... How much my husband gave gift money to the functions in your home? Go check in the book... We gave thousands of rupees... You gave just 5rs? Even that 5rs note is not acceptable with a big hole on it. Hey, you just stop your bloody calculations! Jayamma, you don't know! I received just 25ps and 50ps as gift money for my marriage. Feel happy that I'm giving you 5rs. Thinking your death is the only function left in your home... You aren't giving gift money to anyone right? You changing your colors once your necessity is over? Aunty! This old man is eating laddoos of our function right now. He'll eat.. He'll.. If he doesn't give gift money I'll squeeze everything out of him. Let's go! Oh God! I've never seen or heard a fight like this in my 80 years of life... Pushpa, let's play a bet... I'll teach cycling to your sister without getting injured. Okay... Keep Pedalling.. Keep Pedalling.. Look at her! She learned it. Oh my god, Yesu! Where's the money? I kept it right here... I strongly remember that I hid them right here. Hey Jagga... Why haven't you given the gift money? Will give it by evening sister. Where? In the liquor shop? I thought you were innocent but you turned out pretty smart... No Sister! Will give it by any means sister... I know how to collect gift money from you! Let's go Gopi.. I feel this pain in my heart sometimes... No matter how hard I try to bear it... I'm not able to take it. Stay strong! We'll get the money in just 2 days... Even if that money isn't enough... We'll do something or the other to get the operation done... Even I tried to borrow from a few people... But, couldn't find any possibility. Somehow, they'll be arranged. Don't think too much... Eat well... Is everyone here? Brother-in-law... Shivarathri is very close.. What about the celebrations? We'll discuss that too... Lakshmi! Tell us, what's your problem? Brother! You have to do justice to me... They possessed black magic on our kid... I'm so worried in fear of its circumstances. He's not even eating since 3 days. Paarinaayudu... Who possessed your kid? Who else would it be? There he comes... Tell me, If you can't do anything... I'll kill him right now... Hey Soori! Did you start it again? Won't you change at all? You keep possessing black magic on all the kids in the village... It is our bloody fate... Where did you learn this black magic? Where else could it be? Won't he continuously roam in forests... That's where these things are taught. Maybe... See how he's standing... like he doesn't know anything at all Look here... If you didn't lift the possession on kids right away! You're going to lose alot... One more time... If you do any such dark activities... We'll tie you to the trunk and break your teeth. Mind it! Go Away! Bloody Rascal.. If he didn't lift it in 2 days... I'll kill him for sure... Go man.. You can kill him later... Uncle.. Uncle.. Jayamma Aunty is coming Why's Jayamma coming to council now? What happened Jayamma? What brings you to the council? Why will I come? It was you, who made me come here. Very well... Very well of you to say that? How did we make you come to the council? Like some proverb... My situation seems very funny to you Isn't it? Okay Jayamma, Tell us your problem? Respectable Village Heads! You know everyting... There's nothing new to introduce about me and my family... There it is. My grandfather's portrait over there is the evidence... You all know how my man was 15 years ago and how he's now... Thinking that all the villagers are our own... He kept on giving gift money beyond his capacity for everyone's functions. Don't know how this gift money became a habit to him, but... Even I got habituated to it... This is also the reason for not holding any properties and own belongings. She started it here too. What exactly happened Jayamma? What else... The first function commenced in our home recently, after 20 years... Thinking that the gift money and gold we gave would sum up to 4-5 lakhs, I thought of getting surgery for my husband and clear debts with the same... But the sum of all the gift money didn't even get close to 1 lakh... -How is that possible? -That's how it is! I started collecting from each home.. Some of them gave it and some didn't... Few of them didn't even match the gift money we gave... What kind of a conflict is this brother? I've been observing her deeds for 2 days, She's demanding gift money from each home... Does anyone demand gift money? Gift money should be volunteered. People will laugh hilariously, if they know it. Hey, Ramineedu! Don't talk nonsense... Last month, when I forgot to give gift money to your son's marriage... You publicized that President didn't give gift money... Why is that so? You could've stayed silent thinking I would give according to my wish? Everyone thinks the same... It's just that, they don't say it out... Look, Jayamma! As per my knowledge and reach... No one in the nearby villages would have had a conflict like this... For every conflict there should be justice... Your conflict... Deserves justice... I believe that... Whoever hasn't given the gift money yet... Tell me... I'll ask them publicly... Is it okay? Hey, Gopi! Read out the names... Manku Naranna Naidu... Your name is first on the list... I know! Not just me, you won't give to anyone else in the village too... And you keep preaching to the people like a village head... Who said I didn't give? I gave it to my son to do it... Hey, Ramakrishna! Haven't you given the gift money to Jayamma? I gave you the money to give it to her You son of a... Uncle! Haven't you heard of the horse race nearby? He gambled the money there... What the hell... You don't even have the brains of a sheep... Son of a ***... You wanna bet on horse racing? Come play with me... [commotion] Jayamma! -Don't mind my gift money has been delayed -Write down, take it! Read the next name Gopi! Satyam Naidu! I'm telling you all at once, Our both families don't relate in any way. Don't bring me into this conflict... Wouldn't be respectable If you call me again for the same. Hey, Satyam Naidu! Listen to what I'm saying. This conflict is about your own brother... No more brother sentiments... You didn't resolve our land conflict for a long time... But, you wanna take up this one? Do whatever you want! Don't you ever call me for these conflicts. -Satyam, Satyam -Let him go. We can talk about Satyam later... Read out the next name Gopi! Mingedu Mutyala Naidu! See, that old man! He gave 5rs Gift money! Even that 5rs note has a big hole to it. Is it Uncle? Who's giving gift money at that level of possibility? At my age, I can bearly walk... How much money would I have? Oh you stingy old man! You don't have money? Like seriously? Do you think we don't know how many deposits you have in the bank? Your son earns 30,000 in Hyderabad And you say, you don't have money? That was a good lie though! You wait Brother, I'll take care of that old man. Read out the next name... Reading names... Stop... stop... stop... Seems there are a lot. It seems there are a lot of people. Shall we give them a chance? I'm telling all of you... People! Whoever didn't gift money to Jayamma Shall gift within 2 days. If you fail, you shall pay a fine of Rs. 200. Let's meet at this council after 2 days. Is it ok Jayamma? I'm agreeing because all the village heads promised me justice. If that doesn't happen... Jayamma trust us, we will take care, go home. Please make me get the gift money. I don't have a lot of time... Come Gopi. Jayamma! Jaya! You went out for this? We should bear even if it is hard... Why do you go to the council and make fun of us? It's not about helping, we should know how to ask for help. I'm not going to listen to you in this one matter dear. I cannot convince you! Spare the rod and spoil the child! Keep working. How many ladoos did he get from function? He is still eating the same ladoos. Shameless. -You eat the grass. -Hello... Hello Venkatesh uncle, In front of your house, Jayamma.. This old man won't listen my words. Why don't you return their money? My fate! You can do whatever you want, I will not gift more than Rs. 5. We will be better off if you don't. Our animal shed isn't good We use your house as one till you return our gift. Jayamma aunt, Venkatesh uncle wants to talk to you. -Hello. -You know about my dad right? I will transfer the money, please don't make it an issue at the house. It would be good if your dad had a bit of your intelligence. Gopi, lets take these oxen and go. Look how he is eating the ladoo. Shameless man! Hey, remove that dung. We can make some dung cakes atleast. He is dead, you can take the body. Take care about the formalities. Mam, did you pay the money completely? Not yet doctor. Don't pay, he will cure on his own. You can reach us immediately during emergency if you are from this city. You are in a rural area You might not reach on time. His position is too bad, he should be in observation for 24 hours. We have some money doctor. Can we pay? Do you want us to operate on him in installments? What kind of people are you? It's been a while since you said that you will resolve the issue in 2 days, I left him at hospital, then what? Okay Jayamma, we will resolve this issue and go home tonight. Do you understand? Gopi read those names... Jagga rao. What happened to that money? I can't sleep or stay at peace because of this Jayamma. Its been a while since I saw Yesu babu. He is not with us since Pushpa is menarche. Are you really our village youth? How can you meet him, while he is busy teaching cycle to all the girls. After all, do you know? He gifted silver anklets to Pushpa the other day. Not just that, he is buying a lot of things for her. No one knows, how is he getting all this money. What happened to the money in the box? [folk song playing in background] [song continues] Bloody... I'll get you... And I'll kill you. Nethala Pernaidu. Pay for tests. Take it, there is 200 less, my boy is on the way, will pay once he is here. Okay, we have a test for 200, we can do that after payment. You always keep asking for money. If it is not for your innocence... How much money will you spend? What can doctor do for black magic? People from my home town admitted a boy who is affected by black magic here, They just spent huge money but the boy didn't get better. Poor soul! He died on the same bed that your child is allotted. All this is because of you. You don't escort him from school. He went straight to that black magic suri. What else he will do? If anything happens to my child, I will kill you and Surya Rao. Pandit Satya Babu. Babu... Babu... Merchant wants to speak with you. I told him that I will pay by Shiva ratri. -Hello. -Hello priest... With all due respect towards your job I'm not abusing you. If you don't clear the dues by Shiva Ratri, You might have to meet me at council. You sell adultrated products... And you are threatening me. I will not give money, Go and tell whomever you want. How dare he? Seems like you got a variety. You seem very different today. I have an exam next week. We have to do a ritual for hall ticket. With the sacred words I know, I never performed any ritual. I will do it today! By that, God himsefl will write your exams. Satya is caste feeling prevalent in your village? It is not even a question, after knowing all my flaws they gave this temple, Because I'm a Brahmin. And you? I don't have these caste feelings. Satya, do you like me? Can anyone dislike you? Why do you like me? I used to eat only on Mondays. Now, I'm eating everyday properly. Satya, will you marry me? If you agree... I will marry you today itself. Will you marry me, even if I'm not a Brahmin? Why won't I? We are not Brahmin Satya. My dad loves lord Rama. He learned all the Vedas, to serve him. But no one let him do the service when he said the truth. That's why we had to hide the truth. Some day people will know the truth. Will you stand on our side then? I told you the truth because I like you, Satya. Decision is yours. Majji Satyam Naidu. [machines beeping] Did your mother call? Call your mother dear. You didn't even pay checkup fee, how will you pay up for surgery? They are not here right? Tell us who are here and didn't pay. Mean while, call those people. [thunder rumbling] Jayamma, Lets have the village council tomorrow. [mobile ringing] JAYAMMA PANCHAYATHI [prayers] DID YOU LIKE THE SWEETS? THANKS FOR THE IDEA PUSHPA. [chantings] [continues to chant] Ma'am, can you please ask Sir to come out? Need to check for an auspicious day. Wait, he'll come... We shouldn't get inside the home.. It's okay, please come inside! No Ma'am! If people come to know, they might feel disrespected... I'm hungry... Give me some holy food. Don't be sad. -Hey, Yesu... Stop right there, Stop! -Move away Jamma... Move! If I catch you now... I'll bash you like anything... Give it here... Here it is, your Hallticket... Offered good prayers for you... Your exam will go really well. I've come to a conclusion... No matter what happens... I'll back you up! It's an Ace... Why's babu here, at this time? Do whatever you want but get me my money today! Okay Jayamma! Gopi! Readout all the names... More 5 members Sir... Who are they? Satyam Naidu... Jagga Rao... Paari Nayudu.. Satya Babu.. Jammadu. Finally! Just 5 members right? Hey Jamma, what about you? When are you going to give the gift money? Jayamma indeed gave gift money for my marriage! But you know the fact Uncle! My wife eloped with someone the night of my marriage, taking Gift money and Gold. I brought that guy's first wife in anger! Right in this temple itself, we got married in a simple way! Don't you have responsibility to return the favor, even if your wife eloped? I tried checking the amount Jayamma gave as gift money, but... Accidentally, my kid has thrown the data book in the fireplace... Now, from where can I bring the lost data from? With no other option left... Even though I felt it was too much? I gave 30 rupees... Oh.. is it? Bloody Liar! He might have burn it intentionally... What did you say? You felt 30 rupees was too much? I'm aware of over smart people like you. Each and every gift money we gave... Is noted in our book... If you want, check it! It's 2000 here... Hey Jamma! Place your hand on your heart and say... How much did we give? -Uncle... -Shut up! Speaking nonsense! Being oversmart! 30 rupees was too much? Acting innocence! Go now! Bring back Jayamma's money right away... -Did you hear what I said? -Okay.. ok! Who's next? Why is this conflict for the sick person still being addressed daily? What did you say? Sick person? My husband is sick & sleeping in my home. Didn't sleep like you at other's place with someone else... Should I tell everything in front of this council now? Such an Idiot... Why did you blabber unnecessarily now? Heard it? Hey Jagga! What about you? When are you giving the gift money? I should definitely mention the proof of his intelligence now? He didn't give money but made us write down his name and amount! Why is that so? Why did you give your name and didn't hand over the money? Heard it? I thought of giving the money and so gave my name too! But, my son... He stole the money and gifted anklets to her daughter with them... What did you say? He bought anklets for her? If he really gifted her... I'll throw them right on your face! How much would anklets cost? May be 3000. Do you know how much gift money you should give? My husband gave 2000 rupees of gold to his wife and 1000 rupees to him. He even gave 1000 rupees as gift money for his daughters marriage. If you sum all of them... They'll reach 20,000 rupees! How is it possible Jayamma? You gave gold worth 2000 & 1000 rupees, Totals to 3000. He gave you anklets worth 3000... Isn't that enough? Your thinking way too far Jayamma! Hello, Mr. Head of the council... Do you have any brain? You bought our land 10 years back from us for 30,000 rupees... Will u return it for the same price? You won't right? Because it costs 2 lakhs rupees now! Likewise, our 2000 rupees gold and 1000 rupees now become 20,000. Bank would have given more sum if deposited earlier... Thought I would get justice here... But you seem to backoff irrationally. Conflicts like these can't be solved in Police stations and courts also. Why not? Tell me if you village heads can't solve this conflict... I will get the justice for the same in court... Not just the gift money matter... I've sold many properties to most of the villagers with just trust on their word... I'll also deal with them in court... What are you talking? Why did u say that? Conflicts like these shouldn't be taken to courts... Did any of our village's rivalries reach to court for justice? If we can't solve the conflicts in our village... What is the use of us being the village heads and the existence of this council? Heard it? Jayamma! You just ignore his words... We shall solve your conflict somehow! Hey Satyam Naidu! You left in the midway earlier too... Have some minimum courtesy... This time, you shouldn't leave the place till the conflict is solved... Heard me? What do you say Jayamma? How much gift money is pending on Satyam Naidu's name? 10 years back on his daughter's function.. Thinking they're our own family, We gave 30+ grams of gold... Brother-in-law, 10 years back, we were all same family. Everyone in the village knows the disputes between us... Don't you know it too? Our families no more share any relation or deals at all... But one thing.. When my daughter had the menarche... They indeed gave 30+ grams of gold... But when did that happen? Back in times when we all lived together. So what? Then you should definitely help now... Do you think 30+ grams is a small amount? No one from my family went to the function Why will we give gift money? Stop joking... When I went their home to invite them for the function... They neither let us in nor let us talk... It's not my mistake if they didn't attend the function or gave us the gift money? Oh.. you think you're a smart lady? You're asking for the gift money you gave 10 years ago.. great! Did you give me any gift money for my daughter's marriage? Huh? Why don't you ask her? You didn't invite us to marriage and so we didn't come... Why will I attend a function without a proper invitation? Why are you all making her cry? Just collect her gift money and give it to her. Stop it grandpa.. The council assembled for the same reason. Hey.. move away everyone... -Move. -Seems like naxals. [naxals traditional wishing] Comrades! This is the land we were born in... These are our lands since our ancestors... We own the rights on these lands... In our fight to save the mountain lands that feed us... Everyone of you should join us... "This history is being scripted for sake of our lands" "This fight is happening for our lands" "This happened in Srikakulam" "Cultivable lands to the East and South..." "Fertile lands to the south and barren lands to the east" [group sings along] "Our brothers are irrigate those lands for a living" [group sings along] "They sweat it out for the lands" [group sings along] "We will break anyone who oppose this" Naxalites at Pedda Kotipalli... Brothers came just last night.. Right, Jamma? How did the print media know it? Someone from our village might have leaked it... [vehicle honks] Aren't they police, right there? -How many of them were here? -7 or 8 people sir... What did they do? They sang and danced a little, that's it... -Are you the President? -Yes Sir! You and two other people have to come to the station... Okay Sir.. Okay Did she wakeup? No, she didn't Mom! Did that Yesu gift you Anklets? Why did you take them? You idiot! He said it was a gift Mom! Give it to me! Living in misery, she wants luxury! Have you lost your mind or what? Sravanthi! Sravanthi! Go, throw it on the face of Jagga Rao... Tell that Yesu, I'll break his legs if he roams nearby! You haven't seen Shivarathri in our Village, have you? People from 30 villages around temple come here for celebration. Everyone will take my blessings on that day. I'll be like a VIP on that day... Is it? Then, will I get to see this VIP on that day? -Why not? -Tie it tightly... Come brother-in-law. Let's go see our village's council meet... It's more interesting than the parliament and assembly... Hey Jaggarao! What else can we do? Your income seems to be low too... 20,000 rupees is too much for me to arrange brother... You already have debts... You might get around 1 lakh if you sell your house, won't you? His wife hanged herself in that home... Who else will buy that home uncle? Someone might.. Why do you care? Don't know why.. He gets involved in every matter... Always speaking negatively... Okay Ok! We shall discuss the Jagga Rao issue later. What about you Priest? When are you giving the gift money? You know the funds of our Temple... They aren't enough for even the daily pooja offerings... Babu needs to pay 2000 to me too, When asked about the same... He's threatening me... Please get me my money from him! 2000? What was the purpose? Ask Babu itself! Even Tirupathi funds aren't enough for Babu's lavishness... Jayamma! How much is Preist's gift money? When his father was alive... He came to our home, He said he didn't have money to do daughter's wedding And asked for debt to avoid the marriage break... My husband hesitated to give it as debt... and gave 10,000 gift money with 20.50 grams gold. Now, Tell me! How much should I get? Summing up everything... It could reach 30,000... Doesn't it? What to do now? Priests don't even earn well... Brother-in-law! Before his father died... He deposited 50,000 rupees in bank... It might have reached 70,000 now... He saved it to benefit his daughter-in-law after my marriage... It's because of your father's trust in you. Paarinayudu! What about you? When are you giving your gift money? My son is fighting for his life and you want me to involve in this conflict? Should I think about my son or Jayamma's husband who's at the edge of his life? Jayamma is not a random person.. She's one of us... She gave me grand gift money on my marriage, But how can I return it all of a sudden? I'll give when I have and when I wish. You couldn't even lift the possession on my son but you want me to follow orders? Oh... That Soori didn't lift the possession on your kid yet? This guy... A big misfortune for our village... Even after deafening him and chopping his tongue, he isn't leaving his black magic. So what Paarineedu? Every one of us has situations... Doesn't Jayamma husband's life counts... We don't know what you will do... You should pay her off in 2 days with a fine... heard me? I won't pay any money.. If you don't get the possession lifted in 2 days... I'll kill all you village heads too. Yeah, kill everybody! As if we're waiting... Go away! Didn't Satyam arrive? Satyam is sick... They took him to Vizag hospital it seems... My bloody fate... All the issues in the village are circling around my husband's disease... When will this priest get married? Who would give debt to this drunkard Jaggarao? When will the kid revive? When will that Satyam Naidu get some brains? I don't care about all these things... Just get me my money from them... It's already late for my husband's operation. If anything happens to him... You and your Council won't exist... Mind it! Jayamma, have some patience, just 4 people right? We'll solve it in 2 days. Brother-in-law... To get this priest issue solved... Why don't we just get him married? Huh! Where can we find a match for him right now? No Uncle! He's already set his match... She's a daughter of priest too! Maybe? Is it priest? -Not exactly... -That's it... That's enough Go and call that Ram Temple Priest... All these issues don't seem to solve so easily and early... Let's all of us the villagers donate, For that operation expenses. What did you say? Donations? Do I look like a beggar to you? Eating all my money... Do you want to treat me like a beggar when I'm nill? Shut up Man.. Who among us has that much money? It's not even the yield time yet... Jayamma gave alot to all of us.. But none of us have that much money now. Okay, we'll do something... -Greetings Sir! -Namasthe! We called you to talk about something important... It's about your Daughter's marriage... Your daughter and priest are known to like each other... We have a conflict in our village now... Its solution is interlinked with Priest's marriage Expecting you to decide regarding the same, we called you up here... What are you thinking about? They both like each other and will get married someday right? Let's get it done, rightaway! What happened? Do you want to say something to me? Please tell me, no problem! No... no... we have a small issue here. I need to talk to Satya babu about them. Anitha told me about your issues and queries... I'll talk to her once and... Stop it. You both can talk leisurely after the marriage... Heard me? Fix an auspicious day and we'll get the marriage done soon... Your Villagers are very great... If it was our village.. There would be a riot about caste... What's so great in this? Can't you see it? A Brahmin boy is being engaged to an SC girl here... What? She's from SC? -What are you talking? -It's the truth man! Our Aunt's daughter is married in their village. When he tried to work in the Rama temple of his village... No one accepted it... Is it? Yes! Hey Uncle! Have you heard of these guys' talks? Why do you care about their talks? Babu... Start working on the marriage activities. No, wait Uncle! That Ganapathi Babu isn't brahmin it seems... Then, what? Tell them guys... Whatever you've been discussing till now. Yes sir, he's right! We belong to scheduled caste... What's this? The priest isn't a brahmin? I'm so confused too... I'm a devotee of Lord Ram and I wanted to pray and serve him all my life... I even got a degree in it. But no one is helping me, knowing the truth. That is why I hid the truth here. Please forgive me for what I did. Please! You want us to forgive you even after doing all this? Enough of your sin.. Leave the village before we hit you badly... Wait Man! Do you think it's some joke Ganapathi? Enough of what you did till now... Our village will lose all the fame if this matter leaks out... You've to leave our village before morning did you hear me? -Sir, please sir! -Just get lost! -I need to ask you something... -I won't hear anything about Ganapathi What's all this? As if it's a big issue... You left my issue and debating on this? First solve my conflict... Jayamma, You wait! It's our village's issue! You can't interfere in this... Ganapathi... You should leave the village before sunrise Did you hear me? Sir! Hear everyone... The council meet is over... Everyone goes home. Whose conflict is solved? My conflict isn't solved yet and you insist everyone leave? You said two days and dragged till today... The conflict isn't resolved yet... Hey Simminaidu... Polinaidu! Dama! The council meeting isn't over yet... Stop here. President Sir! -We're leaving sir! -Go away! You've already done enough... Even after doing a stupid sin he acts to be nice while leaving... [chatter] I can't believe that he's not a Brahmin. He is really good at his job. -No on can beat him at it. -True. [traditional chants] [devotional song playing in background] [chanting slokas] Even Babu was cheated by that girl. [news on TV] [devotional song playing in background] [devotional song playing] [duet starts to play] [crowd erupts in joy] Do you doubt anyone for this? He can't talk sir! Simhachalam! Give him a pen and paper to write about what he wants to say... He can't read or write sir... No one from our village understands what he says, Sir... President and Big heads of this village, come forward... It's us Sir! Your village is getting famous everyday... Daily, the first page of the newspaper covers some story about your village. Everyone in the district knows Peddakotipalli now... Because of the activities of your villagers we're getting criticized... The government may issue a police station in your village soon... You've become very popular.. Giving hospitality to naxalites... Burning houses on some blind beliefs. Sir! We didn't give any welcome to naxalites Sir. They came, sang, grooved and went. We had no links with their activities. We aren't aware of the house being burnt Sir! What about the recording dances? We aren't aware of that too... Check these recording dances... You've challenged police... I'll agree... Your villagers are gutsy! But from today, I'll see all your guts in the station... Come sit in the jeep... Sir... we'll come in the auto behind you sir We'll lose our respect if the neighbour villagers see us in the police jeep Sir Sit once.. You'll get used to it... -Come, sit.. -Sir.. Sir Sanyasi Naidu seems to be left out? We'll get him in on the way! -What fate is this? -Uncle... It was never like this. Please take this money for now... I told the doctor that I will pay the rest within 2 days Okay, madam please wait I will call you. [mobile ringing] Jayamma, doesn't have any work. Why did they call us? I don't know why or how did you get it. Sir... Sir... Sir, I'm not a head of the village. I just said so out of pride. So now you want to be a head, right? Srinu, make him a head right away! Just, shut up and sit. If we have to sit quietly we can do that in our village as well, right? Why did we come here for that? You can go now, SI wants to meet you tomorrow. -My back got stiff. -Mine too. Ask them to arrange chicken biryani tomorrow. Just biryani? I will arrange alcohol also! That is our President's home. Be ready from tomorrow, they are coming early in the morning. [mobile ringing] Jayamma is haunting us like a ghost. [Jayamma clears throat] As you are not paying heed to my request I will complain here, Let's meet in the court. Jayamma, don't make this a big issue, let's discuss this in our council. I could not see any council in the village. Please listen to me, Jayamma. Don't take this dispute to the police station. Already SI is abusing us badly, please understand. I will resolve your issue today at any cost I swear on this guy. Heard me? Hello, Who is this? As Lord Rama helped you long ago, How can we survive just by believing in him? It is not a small help! Did you forget? When we are crossing the river with our newborn baby. We went to the Temple of Rama as the river flooded suddenly. Though it was flooding heavily not a single stream made into the inner temple. That is Lord Ram's glory! We all would have been dead the same day. I have decided at that moment, that I will serve lord Ram for the rest of my life. Let's take the kid to the doctor in Vizag dear. Doctor's cannot do anything for black magic. The main reason for this is that Suri Rao and the elders of the village We should kill them first. Sit here all of you. You are coming before us Who are you? Your name is Jammadu right? -Yes. - I stay in neighbouring village. Seems he is Jammadu of thier village. Dear... Come here... Turn around. Did you bring cards? Why did you get cards now? I'm getting bored sitting idly, I got them for timepass. SI will kill us all if he sees this. I don't think they will care for us. [mobile rings] Show. Jokers love me! Though you have all these cases, you should be crazy to play cards here. Sir, you want us to come to the station daily and sit idly. You don't even assign any task. How can you know the difficulty of sitting idly sir? Simhachalam! Charge them under playing cards as well. They should reborn thrice to clear these cases. Jamma, aren't you satisfied with the existing cases? Every village will have someone like you, right? We cannot do anything other than carrying your load. -[chatter] -Sister-in-law... As your brother is ill, I might not attend the wedding. I came here to give gift money. You can gift later Jayamma! Brother's surgery needs alot of money, right? This money will be helpful for at least one injection. Keep it with you. I will take care of everything here. Hello! Am I speaking to Pedkotipalli president? -Yes. -My name is john... I'm the president of Ambedkar youth association Srikakulam Dist. Tell me. Did you throw our people out of your village? Apologize and get them back to village, or else... I will make them file an atrocity case. Attrocity case? Everyone in the village will be in Jail. Mind it! Please don't do that. We will discuss and let you know. There's nothing to discuss, Whether you want to stay in the village or jail. Choice is yours. What happened dear? Only you can help us, MLA sir. I can help with cases like recording dance and small disputes. Naxalites and black magic are way out of my league. It is already in press. If I get involved now, the press will damage my image as well. [metal clanks] [metal clanks] [commotion] Doctor please check the saline. Nurse, where are the reports? Please take care of my husband, doctor. -Nurse... -Dear Madam, come with me. Please relax. Doctor! How is he doing? I told you, he needs an operation immediately, right? If you don't keep any efforts, what can god do? There's nothing more to say. If we do surgery immediately, your husband has very less chances of surviving. Don't take him home. Let him be in hospital till he is got surgery. And they blame us for their deaths! Dammit! [man coughing] [mobile ringing] Have some water. She is haunting me. Who is on the call Uncle? Who would be other than Jayamma? I would have been at peace if there is no Jayamma and police disputes. You are right. We'll be at peace if we can sell one piece of land per week. That merchant would not buy that land without our help. That's why he gave us this party. What? Why are you including yourself? As if you dealt it all? Stupid! Always keeps blaberring. Jamma! Get that rope. Stop here. Do you know Surya Rao's house? There is a school at the end of the street. The house before the school is his house. -Who are you? -Minister's PA. Go! What does Minister want from Surya Rao? How can I know? I need some money. I'm trying to put out a huge fire right now. Please arrange it for me. I will return it with the gift money. Does any one give debt against gift money? "You just watch us by sitting somewhere" "But you write our fates" "You are playing a strange game" "Are you sitting back and enjoying the show?" "God! You just watch us by sitting somewhere" Jayamma, please spare me some food, I'm hungry. "You give us false hopes" "You play with us like we are puppets" "You make us think everything is ours" "You make us think everything is ours" "But suddenly you change our fates" God! Pushpa! "You just watch us by sitting somewhere" "But you write our fates" "You are playing a strange game" "Just watching the game?" You just hit puberty... -And you want love. -Mom! You are not even worried about your dad's health Mother! God! Both the brothers are suffering from the same illness. "What happened to the days we lived together?" -No answer. -"Having bad dreams in the day" How many days will you suffer dear? Satya likes you so much. He will come here, if you call. Satya likes that hill and temple as much as he likes me. He might come, but he will not be happy. "Mistakes happen..." "Out of arrogance" "When would the issues get resolved?" "What happened to the days we lived together?" "Having bad dreams in the day" "I got barred me from offering prayers" "It's time to offer prayers" "Love has just become a memory now" "Doors of love closed on us" Sir... Greetings! Is Anitha here? I can understand your suffering. Due to this the dispute only gets bigger. And it is good for neither of us. [mobile ringing] If you abandon the patient here... Who will pay the fees? Do you take it as a government hospital? I will pay in 2 days madam. Tell me if you see Yesu anywhere. I have no idea, uncle. Tell him I won't thrash him even if he comes home. Sure, uncle Kalyanamma... Did you see Pushpa? No, Jayamma! Did you see Yesu? I didn't see him. Did Pushpa come here? No, Jayamma! "The dark which has never seen the light" "Lives have turned miserable" [thunder rumbling] "In search of... In search of hope..." "Don't know what lies ahead?" Manjula! -Did Pushpa come here? -No. -Is Pushpa here? -No, Jayamma. Did you see Pushpa? No Jayamma! Jayamma! God! What happened to you? What happened? Wake up! Get up! God! Get up. Did you all gift us money? I will repay in a month, sir. Your colleagues said you are drinking with all the money. I cannot give to a drunkard. Go, go away! Not for drinking, sir. It is an emergency. I will not give, Go! Everyone in this village knows that my grandfather used to talk to lord Shiva. The next generations will talk about Ganapati Babu in the same way. I don't behave like a Brahmin, but I'm the priest. But Ganapathibabu is more Brahmin than me, and you threw him out. Babu, you know everything. Will anyone accept a Dalit as a priest? What about our village's prestiege? There are a lot of Dalit priests in many of the temples in the nation. You are not the ones to decide who must be and mustn't be in the temple. The God has the ultimate authority on that. Don't get up. Mr. Jagga Rao... We'll buy this house if you want to sell. You don't feel uncomfortable, please. You can continue staying in the same house. We'll pray here every Sunday, that's it. We won't give you any problem. It'll be ok. Ok? Ok? Ok. In the name of the father, son, and the holy spirit. Amen! Children, let's recite a sentence in the name of Lord today. You follow after me as I say it. No evil will harm your house. [in unison] No evil will harm your house. [in unison] No evil will harm your house. No evil will harm your house. Lord gave us everything we want. We just need to search for them. In the name of the father, son, and the holy spirit. Amen! Jagga Uncle! I'm looking for you... Heard that naxals have abducted Yesu Babu and Pushpa. Come let's go... How much time should we wait for you? Get in the jeep quickly. -Uncle, give me the phone once... -Tell me why? Just give it to me now... This fellow doesn't reveal anything! -Hello! -Jayamma Aunty! -Jammadu speaking! -Yeah, tell me! Naxals have abducted our Pushpa it seems! Now, this one too? Don't know what this Jayamma will do now? -Who's it? -The villager of Kotipalli, Comrade! He may leak our secrets if we leave him now... No Sir! I've come here for my son! He's just an innocent boy, sir! He doesn't know anything... Please let him go Sir! -I plead you Sir! -Don't believe him Comrade! It seems like a plan by the police together with the villagers... I'm telling the truth Sir! It's my son with you... Yesu babu! I came for him... He doesn't have mother... Please let him go Sir! -Yesu... -Hey! Please let him go. [commotion] Dad! Dad! Please listen to me sir! Let him go, sir! Kill him... [shot fired] [shot fired] Mother! It's Jayamma, Comrade! It's her who raised the conflict on Gift Money... We're sparing none who've come here Jayamma... How did you find out about our hideout? Do you know, whose gun was that? It belongs to Taallada Venkanna! Once your leader and my father! Yes Comrade... It belongs to Taallada Venkanna... I've roamed in these forests wielding gun along with my father... I know each and every corner you hide in this forest. I'll leave if you let my daughter go! [naxal traditional greeting] I can see the guts of our leader in your voice, Jayamma! Leave the girl... What are you looking at? Come, let's go! Mom! Don't leave them... Tie them up! Why are you panicking brothers? If he's an informer to police... Why will he come alone for his son? He came here believing that you're one of ours... If you don't value our beliefs why should we protect you brother? Courage isn't just being fearless but winning over the fear itself... ...Said my father! You wanna give courage and leave them or make people fear for you. Is upto you.. -Comrade! -Leave them! [naxals traditional greeting] [naxals traditional greeting] Taallada Venkanna, Lives On! Taallada Venkanna, Lives On! [naxals sloganeering] Lakshmi... How's your son's health? It's been a week Grandpa... He is neither eating nor waking up! Okay... Take Care! The possession won't be lifted so easily... No! Sooridu! Hey, Sooridu! Open the door. Sooridu! Don't do any harm to him... What happened? Why are you crying? That Sillangi... Sillangi Suryarao went inside and locked the door! Hey... Sooridu! You Scoundral! Open the door! Open the bloody door man! I burnt your house... I smashed your head... You still didn't change? Open the bloody door! Move.. you move... Open this bloody door... Open it! You idiot, open this goddamn door! You're going to die in my hands today, Sooridu! This isn't enough for you at all... Where the hell are you? You.. Scoundral! -Do you want to kill my son? -Chinna! Dad! You go home! You call yourself village heads? Understood that you aren't even gutsy men. If the village got to know that Jayamma hanged you all to the tree... Think, what would happen to your honor? Jayamma! You know how many conflicts we have in the village now... Before we even take the action Police are taking us away... They're releasing us whenever they want... To be frank... It's been 5 days since 5 of us had any food... Whom should we complain to? I don't need all of that... I'm only concerned about my problem.. This is the last time... If you don't solve my conflict by sunrise... I'll grave all the village heads in their house itself... It's very much true brother.. Jaayamma will do as she says... If she does... We can never raise our heads with honor till death... By the way... Do you think, Jayamma alone has tied us upside down to the tree? -I don't think so. -Someone else is also involved... If I catch that rascal... We should break his legs... Don't think bad sister! It's already too late... It's okay Jagga! This is his house Sir! -What happened to it? -Burt down due to short circuit sir! Oh god! -Get the renovations done soon! -Okay sir! He's the one sir... Surya Rao! Greetings! You did a big favor to me! I got my mom diagnosed in many hospitals, It didn't help... Your Ayurvedic medicine cured her... How can I show my gratitude to you? I'll do whatever help you want... Just tell me... Don't deny it... Ask what you want... [sinalling something] We can't understand his words, sir! Our villagers are locked in Police Station... He wants you to free them... Get the job done soon... Sir! I always feel the ache in my heart... do you have any medicine for that? He says your problem needs advanced solutions not ayurvedic... -Thankyou Sir! -Greetings! We'll leave now. I misunderstood you... Harassed you a lot... Don't pin this to your heart. Forgive me and... Here, take this money and renovate your home. He is saying that Jayamma has saved him in the forest... He got the medicine because of Jayamma... He's asking to give the money to her. You called us sister? Gopi told me... Despite being younger than us I know how much you both did for us. Out of his ego... Your brother-in-law pushed his wellwishers away. All the money has been spent for the hospital bills... Although I wanna help you... I don't have anything left except this... Take this Jayamma. No sister, It's okay... I'll get it somewhere else. Don't resist Jayamma... Another life mustn't be lost in this house... Don't delay... Take this! [mobile ringing] Go idiot, sit there! We're already fed up with a lot of cases... Now this attrocity case... In Attrocity case Jail is confirmed. Brother-in-law! Let's call back Ganapathi It's the only solution now... Look at the position of Lord Rama in his absence at the village... When he was in the village.. Our Ram used to look divine and lively... If not him at that revenueless temple... No one else would have agreed... We're at this stage right from the moment Ganapathi left the village... We had to keep roaming to this Police station and all... True that! I feel the same now after listening to what you said... By the way, if the Bhadrachalam Temple itself has taught him the Epics & Mantras -We are nothing before them... -Yeah... That's it. Let's call Ganapathi! Heard me? Even Jayamma's conflict will be solved, right? I went to your house searching for you aunty, you weren't there... I came here few moments ago... My husband feels guilty to face you and sent me... He apologized and asked to forgive for what has happened. He's ready to sell the field if uncle needs money... No, it's okay... Most of the money is cleared... How's your son's health? He's fine Aunty! He started playing around... Revenue Minister himself called and insisted to cancel all cases on you... Truly, your villagers are gutsy... Okay, stay in terms at least from now... Don't you ever try to meet Naxals or arrange recording dances ever again! If you do... You'll be sent to jail undoubtedly. Understood? -Okay, Sir! -Leave now! Uncle! The sickness of the minister's mom since ages... Has been cured because of Soori's medicine... He asked Minister to release you people as a return favor... It's true brother-in-law... I know about Soori's medicine... He never took a rupee from anyone who's been cured with his medicine. When that Parineedu's son turned seriously sick... He just used herbs to cure it completely... We thought he has possessed the kid and kept harassing him... -Did you read the paper today? -What paper? -Give it. -Here, read it once... Pedda Kotipalli's medicine is eternal... Give me the paper uncle. We're all fools... We are disgracing the village's honor... He's reviving it alone... Whenever the kids in village turn sick, we blamed him as the reason... I told you, why I love you so much... But, you didn't tell me why you love me? Who else can be as good as the persons living happily, away from the world? Shameless fellow! How could you eat so many sweets on the shelf alone? The entire village cannot finish them eating for a week... Made so many sweets for daughter's function... You ate such big laddoos not even leaving a piece of them. Your father is a drunkard You're a gourmand. Even your daughter ate half of them. Shutup! Besides that you need love? If you're seen around my house or talk to my daughter, I'll break your legs idiot. [Samarasimha Reddy dialogue on radio] I'll come to your home I'll talk to your daughter in front of your eyes. Do whatever you can... Did I just speak my mind voice? -You wanna come home... you idiot. -Brother, stop the auto... Hey... She would've killed me if I stayed in that auto for some more while. Hi Rekha! Should I teach you cycling without being hurt? No need, I know how you teach it! Here it is... the remaining money... -AFTER TWO YEARS.-Impressive Savithri! Impressive! With your consistency and bravery you earned back your husband's life. May you stay forever with husband. I'm blessed Lord Yamadharma! Dad! Here's your Carriage... Keep it there and go... Brother, how are you? Won't you attend our functions, Jayamma? No, nothing like that brother... I couldn't come as the Kids have exams running... I sent the gift money with Gopi. Yeah he gave! How's brother-in-law's health now? By god's grace, he's completely saved and recovered. Everything seems fine, so far! Okay okay... Mom.. Mom! Dad fell unconscious on the field. It's 20 days trip Uncle! Kasi to Kanyakumari will be covered... You didn't join last time too. I'll give you a discount, try to join somehow. I can't roam all the places now... You won't get discount trips like these again... Think about it! Because of the delay in operation or... Because of the hereditary reasons... There's a blockage in heart. We need to do another surgery soon... It needs to be done urgently. If it gets delayed like last time... I won't be able to do anything. How much would it cost doctor Sir? Let's go! Hello Pushpa... Tell me! What happened Jamma? Why are you like that? Nothing uncle... Jayamma's husband is sick.. He needs another heart surgery it seems.. This time it would cost 6 lakhs, it seems. Is it? So sad! Don't know from where she'll get so much money now? That's the issue... Hey, whose home are you taking that to? Jayamma's younger daughter had the menarche. Heard it? Hey, you! Book that Kasi trip for me... It's better if I leave the village for a month. Count us in. We'll travel in peace. We'll rest for a whole month. What will I do in the village if all of you go on a trip... Let's go then... She'll do the function now, won't she? I'll not even give that 5 rupees now!
