(Radio announcer) 'The city is again under attack by the masked vigilante.' (Radio announcer) 'This time four criminals have been attacked at the Khidirpur Dock.' (Radio announcer) 'This is the fifth attack by this Hoodie-boy, in which,' (Radio announcer) 'opposition MLA, Bablu Singh's brother, Bappa is injured.' (Radio announcer) The Crime Branch has been asked to work on this case. (Song)"Alas! Would you forget about the old days?" (Song) "Could anybody forget about these meetings or those intimate talks? (Song) "Come back once more, my friend. Come and be a part of my life" (Song) “We will talk of smiles and tears. And will feel very good about it” (Arjun whistles) Lumbi... Kishmish... Hello... Hello... Good girl... Good girl... Come here... (Excited Puppies Squealing) Hey! Watch how you drive! She could have gotten hurt. You okay, buddy? You’re alright... Baby! What did you just say? I said, watch how you drive, she could have been injured. What did you just say? I said, there was a baby on the road... So watch how you drive... Firstly, it’s not a baby, it’s a puppy. And puppies are meant to be killed on the road. Hey, I am talking to you... Look... I don’t want to fight. (Mocks him)... You don't want any trouble but we want to trouble you. You have messed with the wrong person, kiddo. Now, you will die, and so will this puppy! Baapi... Coming... Wait you... Check here. Hey... Hey... Did you notice a boy running with a dog? No? Oh, man... Check in there... You check there, and you all with me. (Goons panting) Nobody is here... Guys, forget it. We have lost him. Let's go. What a waste! Let's go and play a game of cards. (Puppy whines) Shutter down. Do it now! He is here. Switch on the light. Don't be scared, Kishmish. You made us run a lot! Brother, I don't want to fight, please. This puppy... I have told you before, and I'm saying it again... I don't want to fight. Kishmish... (Arjun whistles) (Arjun whistles) (Arjun whistles) What's going on? Will you take the entire day for this? Who's in? Quick... take him quick. Quick, take him to the hospital. And what is this one saying? Madam. He is saying there was just one person. The description and other details are matching with the other case. Hey? There was just one boy, right? Tell madam. Riyaaz... Manik... Peter... and... Baapi. Not your nickname, tell me your full name. Shubhonkar. Actually madam, initially, I thought it was some gang war. Because looking at them, it doesn't seem like one human being could do this. It was just one guy, madam. In a hoodie. For one puppy, he beat us so much. Just shut up! Did I ask you to talk? Talking nonsense! It’s him. I’ll handle this. Madam, look. We had orders from the high command that next time something similar happens, to involve the crime branch. And so we did. Or else a simple case like this, we manage daily. We will handle it, ma'am. You don't need to stress over it. We’ll handle it together, Mukherjee. Now, call a sketch artist. Yes, madam. Hey, why is he still sitting? Pick him up and throw him in the jeep. Sir! Sir, I think it’s the same vigilante, who was at Khidirpur Dock. But I am still on it. Yeah, see you, sir. Madam. Here is the sketch. What is this? Sketch, madam. Mukherjee, this is too general. If you take this outside and look, half of Kolkata's youth will come under your radar. We need something more specific. Madam... Madam, please listen to me. It’s possible they could be lying, or they could be intoxicated. I mean think of it, madam. One boy versus so many of them? Have you seen the size of these goons? Do you remember the size of the goons at Khidirpur Dock? Their state was worse than this, right? I know it's the same guy. Madam, at Khidirpur Dock, those goons, were supplying drugs inside the body of dead animals. Now, whoever it may be, is making our jobs easier. What? Mukherjee, when you joined the Police Force and I, the Crime Branch, did we take this job so that any random person wearing a jacket, could do our work? Take the law in his hands? The other day he beat up the smugglers at the dockyard. And now he has beaten the biker gang to a pulp... I mean, no one values law and order! You and I don't have any value! I'm sorry, madam. Sir! Any updates? Any link? Any progress? Sir, we are on it. Akshara, we need results. You know why I have assigned you on this case! Right? This is no ordinary case. Vigilante in our city...! Hollywood films are influencing and spoiling our kids in Kolkata. They are thinking of themselves as superheroes. Bloody nonsense! Sir, I know exactly... I know exactly why Crime Branch has been involved in this case. So, let’s not sugarcoat this! Ohh c'mon, Akshara! No, I am serious sir. At Khidirpur Dock, if the vigilante hadn't broken the bones, of the local politician's younger brother, this case would be sitting at some local police station. It wouldn't have ever come to the Crime Branch. Can we please first concentrate on solving the crime? Yes. That is what I want to do! And the only reason I have accepted this case, is because nobody is above law and order for me. And now this case has become a joke... There are fan pages of him on Facebook. Yes Sir. In fact, a few days ago, two of his fan clubs had terrible problems between them. Sir, there is news that the superstar Jeet is also making a film about him. The title is also quite interesting, Adventures of Hoodibaba! Shut up, Mukherjee. Sorry sir. We need results Akshara. This is the 5th time he has attacked. Before he does anything more serious, or kills someone, we need to stop him! Understand? Sir. Whoever this is, he’s not a killer. Just notice the pattern of his victims. Everyone’s right jaw has a fracture. His left hook is very strong. He knows the human body like a surgeon. He has no intention to kill anyone, he is just... He is just trying to make us notice something, that’s all he wants, and he cannot hide from me for a long time. May I come in? Hey, how did you come inside? What do you want? Courier boy. Legal documents for Akshara D'souza. - Madam... - Yeah, that’s me! Legal paper sent by Mr. Amrit. Who sends a consolation prize with divorce papers? Please wait. Yeah, sure. I am so sorry, madam. Why sorry? No I mean, you are getting a divorce, so... Getting a divorce is not a bad thing... To live in a marriage that suffocates you for a lifetime, is more tragic. You should be sorry for that instead. People suffer from heart attacks, you should be sorry for that instead. This is not something to be sorry about. Can we get back on the case? Excuse me, can you please take this back? Can you please deliver this back to the same address you brought it from? Usually, we don't deliver back. But, if it's urgent then... It's urgent. Thank you. It will be rupees two hundred and... Park Street. Rs. 238. - Rs. 238. - Keep the change. Why? Five hundred minus two thirty-eight means... Two forty-two. No, two sixty-two, I have two fifty at the moment... I will return twelve rupees later. Here... Thank you. Thank you. Shut down these Hoodie-boy fan pages! Yes, madam. Come on... All in a queue. Sonamoni Rest. Attention. Bow. Good, now kick with right! 1... 2... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10... 4... 5... Hands will come down straight. Left kick, left hand. Okay? And 6... 7... 8... Four times... Right kick, left kick. Punch, punch. I will come later and check again. Colonel. Good boy. Don't be mischievous, okay? Alright. 1... Take care of the house, Colonel. Okay? Good morning, Dutta Kaku. Good morning, son. Yes, tell me, Mr. Govind. Wow! Dutta Babu... Using ten rupees note as a bookmark? Very rich! Isn't it better to use 10 rupee note as a bookmark, than buying a bookmark worth 10 rupees? So whenever I need, I can use it like 10 rupee currency. You are a clever man. Say, what are you sending today? Mughal's pride - biryani masala, for my brother-in-law in Canada. Gobind Babu. The problem with you guys is that you do not do your research. Where did biryani come into India from? Mughal rulers brought it, right? Gobind Babu, this is the problem; the history you have read is all messed up! Sugar, halwa, biryani, if these are Mughal inventions so did they attack India to set up a sweet shop here? Big brother, you please focus on my courier! Vancouver... It will be Rs.1338. Hey, courier it. Handle it. Dutta uncle... If you will keep giving history lessons to every customer like this... They will then know their history in a few hundred years. Also, biryani? What is there in biryani? It's just an overrated item. Why do people eat it? Uncle, good morning. Oh yes. Your morning quota. But you are a vegetarian, right? Vegan, uncle. Nonsense, how can a Bengali be vegan? Uncle, where is Shonku? His food has been lying out here since last night. Seen him? Watch out, maybe he has been used in the biryani. - Hey, stop talking rubbish. - Why? Does it not happen? He is talking nonsense. It happens... But all that is only during the festivals. It's demand and supply. When they run out of mutton, they cheat with dog meat. Uncle, I will go look for Shonku. - Yes, go. Shonku? Shonku? Batul? Batul, let's not wander around now. Where is Shonku? Now no more roaming around, Batul. No more roaming around. Okay? Okay? 'Lotis Blue' The world's rarest butterfly. They only live for 10 days. Which means the day... She evolved into a butterfly from a caterpillar... On that day at the dockyard, our men were attacked. Money lost... that's fine. The loss suffered due to the goods captured... I can forget all of that. I can re-earn all that. But commitment and reputation. We have to meet our delivery commitment. Sir... Commitment should not be missed. So what are we doing next? We will make the delivery, Sir. You heard the man. Delivery will happen on the committed day itself. Quickly put the packets into the bodies of the animals... and put the shipment on its way. (Phone buzzing) Yes, Mr. Gandhi. Good, and you? Of course, Mr. Gandhi. Any moment now, any moment. It's arriving from Corbett to Kolkata, and from Kolkata, straight to your Dubai mansion. Patience, Mr. Gandhi, it's a beautiful male. It will be worth your wait. I just hope you remember your committment. Khidirpur Dock's license, yes. Sure, you too, Mr. Gandhi. Naughty dog. Look how much you hurt yourself! Nothing comes out of a fight, Batul. Good boy. Now, go and play. And listen, if you see Shonku, then tell him, Arjun won't be angry and to come back soon. Okay? Uncle? Say what? I need to send a courier to Yale University. Have you even heard the name? Yale University, was constructed using the dirty money from the Indian slave trade. Nothing to boast about. Listen, mister... I don't want history lessons. I will courier from somewhere else. As you wish. Go on. Uncle, this way we will lose all our customers. It's better not to have such customers. What did you say? Forget it. Hey, you didn't find Shonku till now? No uncle, it's been two days. Haven't found him yet! I am going to look for him again at Haritaki Bagan with my friends. Where did this dog Shonku disappear? Shonku... Shonku... Shonku... Shonku... Shonku... You look there. Shonku... Come quick. Shonku... Shonku... Shonku... Shonku... Shonku... What's the delay, Mukherjee? - Yes madam. - Where is the informer? Shonku... Yes. Pick up the phone. Shonku... Shonku... This is that courier boy? Yes, madam. Hey, courier boy! - Hi. - Hi. What happened? Looking for someone? Yes...Shonku. Friend? Dog friend. Hold on. Here, your 10 rupees from that day, here 10 rupees and... What? And 2 rupees, 12 rupees balance. Thanks and... Ahhh Shonku, as in Professor Shonku. Which breed is Shonku? Jonangi... Indian breed, but very rare now. Do you mean stray? What do you mean by stray? Dogs are dogs. In fact, so many Indian breeds have become rare now. Like Rajapalayam, Mudhol hound, Junangi is very very rare. Ok! Mr. Wikipedia of dogs. Arjun. Huh? My name is Arjun. Of course. Akshara. D'Souza. Sorry? No, that day I brought the courier, so I remember it from the envelope. Right. Listen, if you don't find your dog, then please lodge a complaint with the police. If this breed is so rare, then we will try to help you find it. Are you seriously going to register a report for my friend? Of course. You were right ma'am. Absolutely right. Check it out, the van used at the Khidirpur Dock attack, I mean the one in which, they were carrying drug packets stuffed inside dogs. That van actually is from Taltala. Which means... Our vigilante is operating between China Town and Khidirpur Dock. He knows that area very well. Exactly, madam. And it can be anyone who knows the area that well. Like newspaper boy, courier guy, cleaner... May I come in? Hey, Arjun. I got your message. Tell me. How can we help you? You had mentioned that if I can't find Shonku then, I can come to the police station. Please register my missing report. Shonku is missing. Shonku? - Arjun’s pet dog. - Friend! Friend! You know? Dog friend! Wow! Here we are going through another level of stress, and you are worried about your dog! Seriously, people have too much free time! There's no free time, we need to prioritise. If there's someone important to you, you prioritise them. You take time out for them. Right? Absolutely, we need to take time out, we have to! Shonku is important to me. Please register a missing report. Mukherjee, please take his report. Hey Goshal. Register his missing dog report. Your dog... I mean your Shonku is of what breed? Jonangi. Jonangi. Indian breed, very rare. I don't think you know about them, but... Arjun, actually we are working on a big case. We will make time for Shonku, I promise. Thank you. Yes, of course, we will have to make time! Stop it! Birthday gift, courier. Mishti, a gift has come. Be careful. Hey, courier boy. Come up. Quickly! What is this? It's not my mistake. This is a packing error, because of which the fish has died. This goldfish... I know it's a goldfish, why is this fish dead? Nemo! Brother, this goldfish died in the packet. So should we keep a funeral for it? What? It's a fish, it died. There is no insurance for it. Throw it, and get out of here. But she died because of your careless packaging, and... - Are there more dogs in there? - Why? Do you want to buy? Brother. These dogs need air conditioning, they get stressed in the heat. Hey, Mother Teresa's father, get out of here. Brother, one out of these is a winter breed. You can't keep him like this. It's wrong! - Hey! Where are you going? - They are getting stressed. - The heat is troubling these dogs. - Shomo! What if I keep you like this? - Brother listen to me... - What's your problem? These dogs should not be in the heat. It's bad for them. - Listen to me. - Get out of here. - But please listen... - Get out... out! Get lost! What's going on, Arjun? Pick him up. How dare you push me! Listen, Mr. Bakshi. I know that this poor kid teased Arjun a little bit. But... Look at this. This is too violent. Is this a boxing ring or what? We think Arjun needs some help. I am very sorry but you are going to - have to... - No sister, I am very sorry. I don’t want Arjun to study in a school where the principal justifies the act of bullying, and questions the person standing up against it. I have made my decision. But I never said anything about rusticating your child. Mr. Tarun. Mr. Tarun. Eat. Always remember two things. They laugh at you because you are different. But while laughing at you they forget that they all are the same. So who's special now? The different one or the ones who are the same? The one who's different from all. Exactly! And secondly... Fight for what you feel is right. Otherwise, it gives more courage to the oppressor. One more Mishti Doi (sweet curd). After training. Stance is the most important thing in Martial Arts. It will give you the balance and the stability. Watch my feet. 1. Shoulder width apart. 2. Foot back... and... Lock. Can you feel centred, you feel stable? Never attack first, no matter what happens. Leave the dog! What did you say? Give your attacker one chance, at least one warning. So that he waits and realises that he is doing wrong. I don't want to fight. But if he still doesn’t understand... Then with strength in your feet, and force in your hands... Attack! Take position. Force in your feet. Strength in your hands. Attack! Attack! Attack! Always fight for what’s right, Arjun. Especially for those who don't have their own voice. He didn't even hear you. Shomo. Let's go brother. Bikki brother, c'mon, let's have a drink together. Since the lockdown has ended, the demand for these dogs have increased. If the demand for the dogs has increased, when will my demand increase, brother? Hey Shomo, forget about the demand. You know what it is today. We have to load the big shipment. It’s such a headache to smuggle these type of animals. Who keeps such a dangerous pet? Shomo... before putting him into the van you gave him the tranquilizer properly right? I did give it, buddy. A little bit here and there may have happened. Must be asleep! Okay. You guys deliver him to the dockyard, I am heading to the dog storage. The lift is not working there. Let’s go. - We should ask Bikki to join us. - Yes, call him. C'mon Bikki Brother at least have a drink together, come! Bikki brother, at least have one drink. Bikki brother. At least these people should understand the value of such books. So what’s new, Arjun dear? Why does your mood seem off? Uncle, I have trained Shonku and registered him for a dog show. But he is missing. Dog show? Stupid, Indian dog breeds are not allowed in Indian dog shows. During British Rule, they used to write 'Indians and dogs not allowed'. And now 'Indian dogs' are not allowed. But this is wrong uncle, that NGO's has a slogan... 'Adopt, Don’t Shop' And they run huge campaigns on this slogan. I have seen their hoardings. And the funds for that campaign come from this show only, think. This is so wrong, uncle, so wrong! By the way, looking at you, I don't think you will sit easy until you go to that dog show. I am going to try at least once, uncle. If I don't try, how will such wrong rules ever change? Okay, that is also true. If you don’t fight for the right, then how will you change the wrong rules? Do one thing... I still feel you should take Colonel for the dog show. He is a bag of energy. What say Batul, should we take Colonel for the dog show? Sir, we were going to take the Hyena to the port but, a boy in a hoodie came and created a ruckus. The hyena ran away. Sir... Sorry. Sorry Sir! You know what I hate the most in this world? Brinjal. And of course inefficient employees. But my blood boils when an inefficient employee says 'Sorry'! Moral of the story- I want my striped hyena back. I want my striped hyena back. I want my striped hyena back. Understood? We will find it, sir. You will find it? How? We will look for it, sir. Yes. Phone? Phone? I had installed a tracker on his neck. Look for it, find it and bring it to me. Or else... Aryan Sir... This striped hyena is... The Corbett National Park consignment, correct? Come. No, actually... These striped hyenas are actually smarter than monkeys. They can count! Aslam, the notes of currency you receive are also worth counting. By that logic, even you are a hyena. Aryan Sir... For the hyena's consignment, you will be charged extra. They are an endangered species! Mr. Aslam, do you know what’s an even more endangered species in India? People with professional ethics! Look, you are expanding your business, right? I have to look out for my own expansion too. The thing is, Aslam Bhai, the responsibility of taking care of the street dogs of Kolkata, is the responsibility of your muncipality. But it is done by my men! And you get your money for that without any tax deductions. Aryan Sir, due to this social service of yours, I am not able to take my family out for dinner. No one can be sure of the ingredients in the biryani, which one eats these days! Forget about the biryani, Aslam. Take your wives to my restaurant in Chinatown instead! Everything's safe there. Thank you, thank You. Colonel, this... This is Shonku's bow tie. We will wear this and go to the dog show... And win! Okay? No, it is not possible. - But. - Go please! But the show is Indian. So what? This dog cannot participate. Indian breeds are not allowed. Can't you see the rules? Go from here! Next. Next please. - Hi guys. - Hello ma'am. - How's it going? Please sit. - It’s going great, ma'am. - Oh, not bad. - Yes. The registration is almost full. Yeah. Hey. Hi. Hi. Is that Shonku? No, no. This is my dog Colonel. Instead of Shonku, I trained him and brought him here, to participate in the dog show. Nice! But he wasn't allowed to participate. But he doesn't care, he is chilling. That's true. He won't- By the way, why was he denied an entry? They say, Indian dog breeds are not allowed. Rules are rules. But this is an Indian dog show. How can they not allow Indian breeds in an Indian dog shows? I said the same thing. I'll have to fight with the organizers over this. Oh no, let it go. These organizers are just like that. Hypocrites! I completely agree with you, but I have to do this. Just wait. I'll be back... - Ma'am, let it be. Please. - I'll be back, wait! Yes? You were saying something about the organizers, tell me. He is the organizer. Ok, I was saying that if the Cricket World Cup is in India... and Indian cricketers are not allowed to participate, would that be fair? Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn about cricket. But I love football. Okay, what if Brazil was not allowed to participate in the football world cup? - Would that be fair? - No, never. Then how can you disqualify Indian breeds from an Indian dog show? This is wrong. Your NGO's motto is 'Adopt, Don’t shop'. And then you aren't allowing Indian dogs to participate. Indian breeds should be allowed! Interesting. What's your name? Arjun! Arjun! Life is not always fair, my friend. Also, there's a difference between human sports and animal sports. Look at this creature, he doesn't even care. Because he doesn't care about winning or losing. Maybe because he doesn't have soul. Excuse me? The Bible says, God breathed soul only into Adam. Then, by that logic, women also do not have a soul either, since Bible does not say that God breathed the soul into Eve. Right? Interesting thought! - Excuse me. - What do you do for a living, Arjun? I train kids in martial arts, and my day job is courier service. Really? Then we are definitely connected. I love martial arts. It’s one of my biggest passions. In fact, Akshara and I, are trained in different forms of martial arts since childhood. So, can we talk about Colonel's participation in your dog show? I am sorry guys, I will have to take your leave. But, to be continued. Why don’t you come over for dinner one day, Arjun? We will peacefully discuss about dogs, their souls and everything. And I will make you some amazing meat balls. I am a vegan. Some cheese balls? I am a vegan! Oh, he is one of those pure kinds. So some plant-based food. Over dinner, can we discuss about Colonel's participation in your dog show? Aryan, stop messing with him. Arjun, that's Aryan. He is the organiser of this dog show, as well as my brother. Actually, this dog show is our parent's NGO initiative. That’s why Akshara took a break from her duty. I always do. But we are meeting for dinner, okay? By the way, is everyone in your family like your brother or...? Excuse me! No. I am nothing like him. Aryan has been very different since childhood. He has always been a loner. He likes everything and anything oriental. He is crazy about Korean films, Korean food. - (Colonel peeing) Sorry. - Thats okay. I am actually surprised... that just after meeting you once, he has invited you over for dinner. Its very unlike him. Very odd. Odd, but interesting. If for nothing else... At least for the sake of participation of Indian dogs in his Indian show, I would like to have dinner with him. Okay, you would like to have dinner with 'him' but what about 'me'? The person who is responsible for introducing you to him? If you are feeling left out, before dining with him, I can dine with you as a thank you gesture. - No, I was just joking. - I wasn't joking. I would love to have dinner... With you. Just dinner. Just dinner! Okay. Pick me up from my gym tomorrow at 8 pm. And don’t be late! I don’t like latecomers. Okay. 8 o’ clock! Tomorrow. I shall message you the address. Bye. Tell me something... If boss had a tracker installed, he could've mentioned it before scolding us. Hey, hey, hey, take a right here. That's where the signal is coming from. It's our area. The hyena has returned back to our area on its own? I can't see anything. The hyena took off the belt? Shit. If boss gets to know about this, he will get us killed. Let's rush. And keep looking! Suit delivery for brother Arjun. Uncle. Hey! It is Tarun's suit, woah. Is it a special day today? Tarun, your father. He was a perfect gentleman. He was a lot like you, but unlike you, he used to respect me. Oh really? Indeed. I've been telling you for a long time to get health insurance. You are young now... Just think about what would've happened if Tarun did not have Insurance. Uncle, father's insurance money would've been finished a long time ago, if you hadn't further invested it correctly. That's why I insist, just sometimes, listen to me as well. I will Dutta uncle, I will soon. I am getting late, and she doesn’t like boys who make her wait. Hey! What did you say? She? The boy has grown up, is it? These days you seem to be forgetting things, son. What? Two? One for she! Thank you, uncle. 'Life is colourful if you want it to be'. Hey, Inspector Lahiri. What's on the agenda today? Which service? Courier or mobile recharge? Or lottery ticket? No, no, Dutta. Dutta Babu, a dangerous man has been lurking around this area. Really? There is pressure from Crime Branch. That’s why Senior Inspector Mukherjee has sent me to investigate. Ohh, ok. I have heard that, a boy... Beat up lots of goons all by himself. Really? Inspector Mukherjee has a gut that it can be anyone with local knowledge. So what you are insinuating is that, at this age I have such good fitness, that I can do action and beat goons up? Oh no, no. Not you sir! I was talking about Tarun Bakshi's son. Courier boy. Working here. Who? Arjun? Punctual! Yes, you said 8pm sharp! I love edamame. - Hmm. - I like it a lot. Arjun Bakshi, 27, loves edamame, trains kids in martial arts... works as a delivery boy at Dutta library. And you have your headphones on all the time. Wow! So much research. Well, it's my job. If I don't do homework, who will? But tell me... What do you keep listening to, on your headphones all the time? I want to know. Usually its the same song. But sometimes... Even when I'm not listening to anything, I still keep them on. What? Why? Because I don’t like talking to people. Now see... No matter how much homework I did, this I could have never found out! Thank you. You didn't do any homework? If I chose to do homework on you, ma'am, - I would have had to go to the police station... - Woah, wait hold on, ma'am? If you call me ma'am, I will call you Sir! - Then what should I call you? - I have a perfectly good name! Okay. Okay. Akshara. Thank you. Tell me one such thing about yourself, which no matter how much homework I did, I could never find out. I mean... What's your headphone? Work! And why do you wear that headphone? I mean... We all wear headphones to escape from something. To forget something. What are you trying to forget? If you don't mind me asking? No, I will tell you. Arjun, my father was a forest officer. Just like you he really loved animals. My mom was a documentary filmmaker. They both met at Kaziranga. One lapse of judgement... From my dad's side at his work... And he lost his job. He lost his reputation, and... As a result, he lost his life. I'm sorry. And... Mom couldn't handle that. She passed away soon after. Aryan became a loner post that. I remember I used to love playing cop and thief as a child. Aryan and I played, and I always wanted to be the police inspector. I think I wanted to emulate my dad. I wanted to be like him. But today... I'm searching for that respect which my father lost. I don't know, I think I have spoken too much. I'm so sorry. Thank you. Headphones. You know, Arjun, I have to say this... Thank you. You're welcome. No, seriously, thank you. I think, post my divorce... This must be the first time when I am actually smiling on a date. Are you okay? Arjun? Is this a date? You have never been on a date before? To tell you the truth, no. Raise a toast to yourself. Cheers. Mr. Arjun Bakshi, you are on a date! By the way, there was no need for splitting the bill on the date. Ohh, no. What happened? We had Arjun with us. But I think he is still stuck at the billing counter. Should we like get him back? Okay, jokes apart, let's do this. Next time you treat me to a cup of coffee. Then our account will be settled. Actually, I do not drink coffee from outside. I only trust the coffee that I make. Okay, so then you treat me to some of your trusted homemade coffee. - Okay. - Okay. (Phone rings) One Second. It’s Mukherjee. I'll have to rush to work. So... I'm going to give you a surprise visit at your home, and you will treat me to some surprisingly good home made coffee. - Okay. - I have to go. Bye. - Bye. - Thank you. (Smiles) Bye, Akshara. Akshara! Dessert. How sweet. Thanks. Hey Shomo, where did boss find that Thai assasin? She is hot. Not hot, she is dangerous. You have no idea what she did to Abdul Sattar. Then what happened to Abdul Sattar? Abdul Sattar's torn pieces of clothing were found in the jungle 3 years later. Body is still missing. Was he turned into biryani as well? That's why I never eat biryani. Let's take this. Hold it tight. Let's move. Eat, eat. All of you enjoy. Listen mister, isn’t this mutton meat tasting a little weird? (Aslam throwing up) Hey, get up everyone. We aren't going to eat this rubbish. Get up everyone, now! Get up! Am I a moron? Let's go. Sir, your bill? Shut the fuck up. Arsehole is asking for payment. Ask Aryan, to pay the bill! Selling dog meat instead of mutton and asking for a bill? College Street, Dutta Uncle's Order No.12567. Chicken Chilly Manchurian, fast. (Dramatic music plays) Dog meat must be used in different dishes, right? This one is barking a lot. He is pissing a lot too. - Keep them down. - The municipal officer had called. We need to pick up puppies from Park Street area tomorrow. Chandu? This is that hyena thief. First, we will break his bones, then we will take information about the whereabouts of the hyena. That day when I was drunk, he took advantage. Thinks he is a hero! Let's take out all his machismo tonight. Where are you taking these puppies? Tell me who are you working for? Where is my Shonku? Who is that hyena for? Where is Shonku? Where were you last night? At least say something. What happened, uncle? Why are you feigning innocence? What happened to that order? It was my special delivery. For my brother-in-law who wanted chicken from Chinatown. Uncle, that restaurant is selling dog meat instead of mutton. So what? That’s none of your business, Arjun. What is this? I am so sorry, Arjun. Listen Arjun, what's with the police? The other day inspector Mukherjee had sent sub-inspector Lahiri! and today someone named Akshara came from the Crime Branch. She took your address a while back. Oh my god! What happened? It's paining a lot dude. Please ask how long will it take? Are you the only one in pain? See this, whole nose is broken. I have informed boss. He is sending a solution. Hey look. Boss was supposed to send a solution. Why has he sent this chick instead? - Hi! - Hi. Your door is not locked? - Yes. - I knocked. But why no lock? Either you are careless or overtly confident. Even if there was a lock, who can stop the Crime Branch from entering? Sarcasm! I like it. I hope your coffee is as strong as your sarcasm. Colonel, good boy. - This is Colonel, Colonel come on. - You know I have met... Colonel, good boy. Good boy! He is actually the security in charge of my house and therefore I don't lock it. - I am sure. - Coffee? Yes, coffee. You like it this way? Being alone? Don't you think it's weird? Don't you feel lonely? Thank you. Loneliness is a kind of negative term. I prefer to call it solitude because loneliness is forced whereas solitude is out of choice. Wow! Mr. Philosopher. - That's interesting but... - Nice coffee, no? Very nice coffee! You know what this reminds me of, my dad. He used to drink this type of coffee. You know what? You will actually get along with Aryan. He was asking for dinner. This weekend good for you? Right. - Colonel. - Can you please ask him to. - Can he not? - Sit down. What is he? You know it's not easy. Generally... Can he not be here? Can you ask him to go there please? No, but Colonel usually doesn’t like anyone except me so he never even enters anyone’s space. But I think he likes you. It’s very rare. - Colonel. - No! Please, Arjun... Please. Please, no... Arjun! I am really scared. Please, Colonel, please. - Colonel is retired, he doesn’t bite. I am scared. You know that he doesn't bite. I may or may not know that. But Colonel surely doesn't know that. Please. - He knows. Don't worry! - Please call him on other side. No, Arjun, Please call him that side. - Colonel back. - Please! Colonel stay, stay! - Stay! Good boy. - Yes, please stay colonel. - Good boy, colonel. - please... - Good boy! - I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm very surprised that you are afraid of dogs. No, on duty I am not scared because... - they are always on leash. - Yeah! But, like, personally I can't handle them without leash. Because... Actually, there was an incident in my childhood. Aryan had a pet dog, Rocky! He bit me very badly. Since then I have been a little nervous around dogs. Which breed was it that bit you? I don't remember. I think it was a... - A Pitbull. - Yes, they can get a bit aggressive. I forgot, I got this for you. Thank you! One second. Yes, Mukherjee? What? Time of death? Okay. Sorry Arjun, I’m in a bit of a rush. I will see you again soon. Thank you for the coffee. Thank you! Bye. By coming here, you are not going to achieve anything. You are just adding to the confusion. I... would like to request you all. Please let the Crime Branch get to the root of this matter. If you keep showing random news on your channel, it's not going to help anyone. We will give you the information that you need and you can share it. But till then, please cooperate with us. Sorry, excuse me! Where is Mukherjee? He should be handling these people. Ma'am? Is this the Hoodie-man? - Sir. - Akshara, you were on top of this right? Then how did this happen? We need to make some arrests. Catch anyone. We need to show the people that crime branch is doing its job. Okay? Good job, Vik. We need more blood. Any details of the people who died? Yes. Bikki and Shomo. Both are Taltola goons. Small criminal records, nothing major as such. But madam, two things seems very odd. Firstly, what were they doing in this area so early in the morning? And secondly, those tyre marks? It's a super bike, madam. Mukherjee, he has never used a bike before. No. It's not him. There is a missing link which we are not able to find. We have to find it. I know we like blood. I know the joy you get out of a killing. But for now, no more killing! We need the hyena. Dogs only bark when the hyena isn't around. You send him a message, to go for the dog. Hello. This way. Please. Thank you! Welcome home, Momo. Oh my god, that's a lot of food. Aryan, don't tell me you made all of this? No, I won't tell you. For vegan Arjun, a brinjal dish, and for us... One, Two, Three. Honestly, after what I have seen in the last few days... I think, I will also prefer vegetarian. Look according to me, there is no such thing as vegetarian and non-vegetarian. Either you are a meat eater or a non-meat eater. Or you are Arjun! I don't drink, thank you! So keep this aside. - Momo. - Yeah? So, Your Hoodie-boy vigilante, I must say he is kicking some real ass. Can you please pass me that? What did you just say? I just said you police officers, your hands are tied by law. And these criminals take advantage of that. This guy is polishing them off, with some style. I am impressed. You know, he is like Kolkata's Punisher. Aryan, you know. What do you think, Arjun? According to me, any person is a vigilante as long as he works within the parameters of the law. Killing someone makes him a murderer, right? Wrong. Vigilante or murderer, they are both criminals. Seriously, did you just say that? I mean, how can you put a murderer and a vigilantee in the same bracket just because someone breaks one of your stupid laws? Because of these laws, so many lives get ruined and so many families get destroyed, who knows that better than me? Well, if there is no law, there will be an anarchy, and who knows that better than us, Aryan? To be honest, a successful anarchist is a vigilante, and a failed vigilante is an anarchist. Do you always converse in such quotable quotes? This is very good. Thank you. If it's okay... Can we talk about the participation of Indian breeds in the dog show? Yes, please do, that's really important to him. Give me one strong reason why should I entertain your dogs? Okay. If we talk about strength, stamina, agility, and obedience, then Indian breeds are at par, if not better than all your foreign breeds. My Colonel, for six years, he is my... He is my pet. On a given day, he can beat any of your dogs. Comfortably. He is amazing. If he gets that platform. And he deserves that platform. All dogs deserve that platform. After all, dogs are dogs, right? Fair point. No, I buy that point. But unfortunately Arjun it's not a fair world. You see this man behind me? He is wearing a suit... breathing the same air, probably more talented than all of us together. Do you think he belongs here? You know, he is blind, but he is not deaf. He can hear you. Do you like butterflies? Aryan is a Lepidoptrist. Lepidopterist, means I collect butterflies. Yes! I have a collection from all over the world, including the rarest of them all, my latest - Lotis Blue. How is my collection? To be honest. I don't see a collection here. All I can see is a graveyard of dead butterflies. It's quite sad! Sentimental, huh? Cute. Why do you have to be so sentimental about death? It’s just course of nature. It’s course of nature when its natural. Hmmmm, it’s course of nature when its natural. The thing is that, Arjun, for a butterfly, to become a butterfly, caterpillar has to die. What do we call a caterpillar in Hindi? Kamla. Whatever! To reach our true potential, we have to kill our weaker selves. If nature started saving every life form then evolution would have never happened. Neither you would have existed, nor me. The neanderthals would have still been ruling. Cigarette? No, I don't smoke. Of course, you don't smoke. This? Mom and Dad. Kaziranga, I think 1989. It's my Dad. 25 years of spotless career. One tiny mistake, and they took everything from him. They snatched his life, his career, reputation, family, every damn thing. For what? One dead fucking rhino. - Ah! Mukherjee! - 'Can you give me a minute? You are a dog lover, right? My sister isn't. In fact she is scared of the dogs. Yes, she told me. What did she tell you? That you had a pet Pitbull... Rocky. Not Balboa! So after that incident, Momo thinks we sent Rocky back to the kennel or whatever. But I will tell you what really happened. I took my dad's service revolver and shot all the bullets right on his face. After all animals lack soul. My sister doesn't. You guys are here. So what did I miss? Nothing much, It's time. Let’s go. Yeah, Let’s go. Basha, will you drop me to the gym? Gym after dinner? Yeah, it’s been a while since we had dinner. And honestly, it relaxes me. This vigilante case is getting too much. I just need to workout. You want to come? Come. Can I sit here? So, Mr. Martial Arts Trainer... What do you have to say? Should I be honest? Okay. Honestly, pivot is missing. Because of which you are lacking balance and there is is no force in your left kick. There are high chances of injuries too. And if i was at your place... Where is the balance now? Look, I don't want to fight. We are not fighting, it's just a friendly sparring session. Come on! Okay. A failed vigilante is an anarchist? Explain. 5 marks. When brave Shivaji held his head high and stood in front of Aurangzeb, was he a hero or an anarchist? Hero. Datta uncle giving you history lessons? But according to Aurangzeb's document, he was an anarchist. Right? Perspective. Those were Aurangzeb's documents. Just like now, as per the law set by the rulers, the Hoodie-boy is a vigilante. But if he or she is not a killer, history will remember him as a hero, right? So what you are saying is that in this vigilante's story, we police officers are the villain? Until the lion doesn’t tell his story, everyone will think the hunter is the real hero. So in our story, who is the lion and who is the hunter? I don't know, but I guessß all will be revealed in good time. Arjun. You are bleeding. I'm so sorry. I have to tell you a secret. What? If you don't like anything that I say, ever, then you can tell me without breaking my nose. Oh, really? Where else did you get hurt? I have lost count. I was just thinking about that - Jaw, ribs. God, I am so sorry. Let me see. No. Let me see where. Yeah, just... I will never criticise your kicks ever again. Balance is also perfect. Good, don't. I understand. No, of course. Mr. Gandhi, you know how I operate. No, I never fail to meet a single commitment. Sure, You will get your hyena back, this week itself. Also, I just wanted to remind you about my dock license. Mr. Gandhi? Sheru. Kaju? Sheru? Kaju? Kaju? Sheru? Colonel? Colonel? Colonel? Arjun, I told you- criminal or vigilante, it's all about the law for me. Akshara, I can explain everything. - You have to come to the police station. - We don't have much time. - You have to come to the police station. - A lot has already gone wrong. A lot of lives have been lost. I will not let any more animals die. You are not above the law. Akshara, they have Colonel. We will get Colonel for you. You said same thing about Shonku. File a report. We will find him. - Yes. - Found him? You are not above the law. If your law was good enough, people would not have to become vigilantes. Your law can't protect everyone. Don't do this. I have lost Shonku. I will not lose Colonel! Arjun, just come to the police station. Akshara, your law is not bigger than lives. Especially for the beings who don't have a voice of their own. Arjun. Arjun, please. Arjun. You must be tired, my boy. You should get some rest, feel at home. You have something that belongs to me. And I have a small part of something that belongs to you. Exchange? Where is Colonel? This is what I like about him, you know. No small talk, comes straight to the point. You are just like me! Here is your Colonel's first instalment. Quite a ballsy dog, I must say. I manually castrated him. He is at ease now. Whether you return my hyena to me or not, I will. In instalments. If you want the rest of your dog Colonel in one piece, it will be best if you return me my hyena. Basha! The dog can fight, huh? Give him a fight. Look's like my hyena has survived. But you won't. What a pity, Arjun. Fancy. Would you like a biscuit? Get up puppy. I don't have all day! Hey, Arjun. I really liked you, man. Thought we could have been best of friends. What are you doing, bro? What are you doing? You know, talking about your favourite word, fairness... Everything is fair in love and war, Arjun. You know how much I love you! Now, moving towards today's breaking news. Kolkata's "Claws and Fangs pet shop" chain owner, Aryan D'Souza pet shop stores get raided by the Crime Branch cell. All kinds of rare and exotic animals and birds have been recovered from his stores. It is being said that the stores were used as a facade for drug smuggling, and for illegal animal meat supply business by him. Rumour has it that Aryan D'Souza case is being overlooked by Akshara D'Souza, who happens to be Aryan D'Souza sister.
