For what it was battery who at the time played Billy ... It was, you know, tuned down, very simple ... ... But in a way was crude ... ... And that somehow sounded to blues, but it was something else.

I have a head ... A head with wings ... I was going to record a while, and Mark recording all ... ... And was always ideas ... Dana was actually a friend was a "roadie" during a tour ... ... And he used to play sax with us Occasionally (with Treat Her Right). I was a big fan of Dana, and always wanted ... ... Have a band only with him ... ... So we did ...

Who is the god of sleep ... ... And that we liked ... We know you play low two strings slide ... - Was it your idea? - Yes. Writing songs ... ... With that low, you know, that way ... ... Was something quite unique ... ... That distinguished him ... There are many instruments with one or two strings in the world ... And it's interesting because each string has all the notes ... ... And is not a limitation at all ... ... When you get used. I met Mark in December ... Mid-December ... 1993 ... ... In the west of France ... It was the first time I made music out of the country ... ... The first time he touched in Europe ... I remember well, I was attending the press ... ... I was out, it made a terrible cold ... ... I was giving interviews and interviews ... ... And suddenly I heard a sound ... ... Was THE sound ... ... And I said, "What the fuck ..." "... Is that?" The Blues Traveler called and said: "I love that album ..." "How did you do? What happened?" We received calls in the middle Recording saying: "How do they get that sound?" And he'd say, "It's a low two strings played with slide ... " And they replied: "Ah, well ... I can not do that ... " It is much easier with only two strings ... ... Because with more than two strings ... ... It is complicated to make a whole note ... This is a type thing Mark ... It is very interesting what he had done with low ... I have to admit, when the band first came out ... ... Cost me understand ... I tried to relate what I did when I played ... Because, generally ... ... From the old days ... ... All under rock n 'roll ... ... One puts the calibration ... ... Some friend delayed ... ... You can not touch anything ... I started with a rope ... ... Because it was easier, and after I graduated ... ... I ascended two strings ... ... And now it feels pretty Full ... Okay, but bears recognized may well say: "I need my four strings ..." No, not really ... one reaches ... - A single? - Yes ... This is simply a extravagance of me ... What I do with guitar and what he did to the low ... ... Was ... is connected ... ... It is ... Requires a lot of participation Billy and Dana ... ... Make this format work ... ... Because we can not support in traditional roles ... ... Of a band due to instruments ... Mark arming the song list the concerts, and there were nights ... ... When I looked titles and said, "What is that?" And he said: "Remember that riff we played two weeks ago?

We tried to capture that of jamming with friends in a garage ... ... Or in a fire ... ... Have that freedom and energy are not trying ... ... To force something to happen outside what happens in that moment ... ... And to capture it on tape ... ... Trying to demystify the idea of ??recording ... You play this instrument, but the type of sax using ... ... It is quite unusual for contemporary music ... You hear it in the rock over what you think ... Prince used quite baritone sax ... Los Lobos use it, Little Richard used two baritone saxophones ... I think it's the most "rock" all saxophones ... Give a dark and very deep sound ... Dark, rich and very warm Dana hands Colley ... He was very intelligent on his part to keep the trio ... ... So the bass could be so prevalent ... They were in front of40,000 people, how do they feel? It felt good, had good people there, I could see it ... We were in Europe, Japan ... ... Throughout the US, Canada ... What site were better received? He was very good in everywhere ...

A FEW YEARS BEFORE "It was ill in Brazil, why he came home ... " At the end of his ... ... Weather in Brazil and then in Alaska ... ... Far away, he returned ... Boston ... ... He had an intestinal disease which will affect the kidneys ... ... Was very serious ... Wanted all we were agreed to return to Boston ... I do not know if returned because their parents They asked him to ... ... Or what, but it did. I was looking our approval ... ... And died searching, so it happened ... Both his father and I were boys at the time of depression ... ... Stability is terribly important to me ... ... And I saw no stability what Mark was doing. He wandered ... and played music ... ... With their small groups ... I never saw coming what was going to his brother Roger ... "... A call from our doctor ..." "... We thought we had some parasite ..." "It is seriously ill ..." "He suffered severe attacks and gangrene in the fingers and toes ... " "We need to disconnect the respirator ..." "Roger died on November18,1978 ..." At that point, he and his brother Jon had become very close ... What was Mark doing? "Jon was an accident ..." "I was traveling to New York (...) with all expenses paid ... " "I was at a party and apparently fell from a window ... " "It appeared lifeless, unanswered ... " "... No movement in his big brown eyes ... " "No smile, no movement of any kind ... " "The machines went out Wednesday March5,1980, He was23, " "It had been only16 months since the death of Roger ... " When Jonny died, Mark was terribly destroyed ... He could not stand as it had made with the death of Roger ... It was really sad and really snapped ... ... Very much ... I suffered for it ... "I feel sad sad life we could have had ... " "Growing old together, being uncles, I wonder the 'whys' ... " "... The reasons that even I want to know ... " Everything was worse than many ways at home ... ... Especially since the death Jon, because he had ... ... A great sense of humor and always making jokes ... ... When everything was tense and everything became brighter ... It was great to have him here ... ... Family ... When he died he left a great void ... After Jon died ... ... Mark decided he had to do something with your life ... ... I had to do something special, it had to be someone special ... ... And that it turned cold ... He questioned us I guess rightly ... ... Never heard his music ... ... Or no music, said: "Music for you is something that plays in the background ... " "When I make music, I want people to listen to my music ... " "... And my words, what I do". The things that happened ... ... The death of his brothers, the relationship with the family ... He could have an extra push, an extra commitment ... It was very difficult to process the death of his brothers ... ... And once it did, was on fire ... ... There was no way to stop it, did what he wanted all along. Mark was a very private man, always on guard ... Some say it was ... ... Cutting, it has been said ... ... Also a bit ... Shy people tend to be reserved ... Mark Sandman was a type booked ... ... And there were things that were forbidden and who spoke ... ... When press did. Mark Sandman ... ... It was a slow person and laconic ... He did not like to explain things too ... ... Liked to talk very slowly ... ... As transgressing all an interview process ... - What was it like being in Australia? - Great ... - It was very good ... - They are very friendly people, seem very happy ... - Even homicidal maniacs, they are also happy for what I know ... - There was a "crazy ax" loose Sydney when we were there ... - A murderer with an ax? - Yes, I used an ax ... - I was in our hotel ... - Really? - Yes. - They never found ... - Really? - So after all are not so happy there ... - Well, it was one guy with an ax, I was not happy ... - The victim was not very happy ... I think Mark and I started to be closest ... ... As brothers substitutes once Jonny had died and Roger ... ... They were about the age Billy and mine ... Jonny played the saxophone, I played the sax ... ... So I think I had a special relationship there ... ... Of which I was not aware, until I came across the story of his brothers I'm not sure he transgressed an interview process ... ... Just not wanting to answer things you do not want to answer ... He never opened, you had to get to know its history over time. - Tell us how you feel about music, Mark. - The music? The first time did everything he could to keep record a single word ... He talked and walked back to me, using that tone ... ... Under, underground, it seemed that he was swallowing the words. So after that first long interview we had ... ... Were only a handful questions of mine and nothing more ... ... Recorded on the tape. It was not until I spoke with some friends of Mark ... ... Who were older than me ... ... I knew what stories I had spent with Roger and Jonny ... One day he gave me the saxophone his brother ... ... Wanted me to have it, to touch him ... I preferred mine, and I said "Thank you very much ..." "... But I feel more comfortable with my own instrument ... " That was the first time I heard he had a brother ... ... And no longer lived ... - You do that a lot ... - What? - That to hide in your songs ... Thank you very much to everyone here ... You, you, you and you ... Now is the moment of poetry ... It says ... One ... In April of '92 and was able to play again ... But, for some reason, was not the same ... ... Had developed a voltage in all this ... ... While I was gone. First of all, Billy Conway It is our full time drummer ... ... And I think there is much more unit and is reflected in the record ... I felt like ... ... You know, the issue was never discussed ... Sharks patrol these waters ... Sharks patrol these waters ... Hey, do not let your fingers rub the water ... No sense discuss anything ... ... So I felt, and I think Mark so he felt so ... He might seem cruel and hard ... ... But digging a little saw that it was not like that at all ... People thought their image and his music ... ... Was a mysterious type, he cultivated that ... ... Somehow in the media ... Your name, was almost unbelievable I had that name ... ... Which was really "Sandman" (Man-sand). Do not worry about the life orange day ... Do not save, not save you ... Nothing to coast as fast as you can ... Nothing like a motherfucker ... You could get tense, could be difficult ... ... Wanted things They were easy ... ... Or whether things done your way ... When you suffer many losses in your family ... ... Feel the urge to autocompadecerte, or mystify you ... ... Pain somehow ... ... Or just give your worth ... He had the opposite reaction ... ... Found some relief in being alive ... ... And do so. Nothing ... Nothing, nothing ... Mark could be the idiot The world's largest ... ... And I had thousands of fights with him ... ... And many differences ... And for a while ... ... I felt a grudge against him ... Now I do not feel well, but I felt then ... ... I thought he "do not want to search places to play ... " "How does this type for get recitals? " "I'm going to hang out with this guy, to see what happens ... " He felt that he had risen to me to get to where I had come ... Mark was a talented guy, very funny ... ... But could be a complete asshole ... There were a couple of occasions ... ... While working with him ... ... Where he was being so stupid, I said: "I have to take a break". Quick as those ships to the now ... ... always glorious, the ever present now ... Served with flowers, fried and cooled with paper towels, then devoured ... Do you know? I spent fifteen years of my life a raft ... Fifteen years ... Now I have something to say ... Stay in those boats life, people ... Stay on boats ... ... no death out there, no death out there ... Sharks patrol these waters ... Sharks patrol these waters ... Do not worry about the life orange day ... Do not save, will not save you ... Nothing to shore as fast as you can ... Nothing ... Come on, anything ... When you're in a band with someone there is much tension ... It is easy to see ... Everything you see ... ... A person who only bothers you ... And he also felt the same about me ... ... Came to say: "How can you be so I stupid? This is a great idea ... " ... And vice versa ... They went to Detroit for an event organized by a radio ... ... A recital for a lot of people ... Then he returned with aires rock-star ... ... So I insulted, I said is off to hell ... The point is that many people I saw a cruel, cold ... ... Inaccessible ... ... But he just it was quiet ... ... Always waiting for something that catch your interest ... His relationship with Billy and Dana ... ... It was beautiful, because There were three ... ... And he had something called "Men intertwined" ... ... It was a cartoon drawn by him ... ... Which dealt with the difficulties in relationships ... ... Being in a band ... ... And how the three became a unit ... ... And they were fantastic comic ... ... And then came the whole concept ... ... The concept of how Mark saw his band ... ... How they were in a "ball" and sometimes something happened and disarmed ... ... But no matter what happened, were once again a single skein ... ... And so was actually their relationship Billy and Dana ... I think his musicians were their "blood brothers" ... ... They were his family, and the community of musicians ... ... It was his family ... ... And it was home who always came back ... ... A family of musicians, artists, creators ... ... And he healed them, loved ... And now comes a song called "Cure for pain". Well, we are beginning to say goodbye, ladies and gentlemen ... ... The encores begin now, thank you very much ... We are very grateful, this has been fantastic ... Thank you ... For you ... You know? I do not know ... A song called "Cure for pain" It reads ... Where ...? ... is the ritual? Tell me where ... ... where is the taste ... Where ...? ... is the sacrifice? Tell me where ... ... where is the faith ... Someday ... ... will a cure for pain ... That will be the day ... ... you pull my drugs ... ... when they find a cure for pain ... Goodnight, thank you very much ... Thank you ... Good night ... He told us the acclaimed it was as a musician ... ... Wanted us to see him, I listened and invited us to go ... He invited us to his concerts ... We never went, we felt it was not for us ... ... And then it turned out it was true. Good Morning ... We went out last night ... ... Leave until very late ... - We realize. We never gave credit by being a musician ... ... And in that sense not feel anything about it ... His father was a businessman and Mark was lousy for business ... Could be creative, in fact it was ... ... But it was lousy, and I think his father ... ... You could not relate to him at that level ... When we were doing ... ... More intimate and committed ... ... I knew his family idea ... ... Became more important to him ... ... Especially her biological family, did much to be more at home ... ... With his mother and father ... He lived a little more conventionally me, somehow ... ... To relate somewhat more with his mother ... ... Invited them to eat and she ... ... Was moved because the house was arranged and had a good meal ... It meant a lot to her, It was important ... After reading memories of his mother, I think ... ... Understand a little better what happened ... ... As parents to lose two children ... I can not imagine how to continue after that ... Last night I told a stranger everything about you ... He smiled patiently, skeptical ... I always knew I'd hit no matter what you did ... ... and I know you did everything ... ... despite me ... Despite being unaware of Mark what he did ... ... Maybe Mark was not very predisposed to detall?rselos ... I'm still proud to have met the short time I met you ... ... grateful to have been a step in your way ... ... proud to have been part your illustrious career ...

Just what I knew, I already felt very comfortable with it ... I was moved by the enthusiasm of these people ... ... For the love of music, that seduced ... He began to speak Italian right away ... ... And throughout the trip Airport to Palestrina ... ... Was "How do you say this? And how do you say that? " "What is this place? How is the festival? " "Tell me, tell me ..." He wanted to know how he lived people here ... He wanted her we counted about this life ... We told him all about this life ...

Took me a while to absorb the details and know what had happened ... When he was on the news, daily ... ... Information was taken from people outside our circle ... ... And so people thought it was a Drug-related death ... But anyone who knew ... ... Knew that was something what he did not think at all ... He had survived and his brothers did not, so I had no interest in drugs ... ... At that level, between us there was no doubt ... ... That he was dead for some heart problem ... And what happened next was very important to us ... Dana Colley ... ... Crying and screaming ... ... To the moon up there ... ... At five o'clock ... You know ... ... Try to be near him ...

But they knew what had happened while coming from the airport ... ... And when they arrived at the hotel they asked for us ... Somehow, immediately they knew what to say ... I approached Dana and said, "What you need to do?" "You want us to play or prefer not? " "Do you need help with something? ?Company? Whatever you want ... " We said: "They have to play, it should be ... " "The show must go on" more cheesy that sounds ... ... It was the best way to honor him, Mark wanted to touch like ... And they ... I did not go on stage ... ... Because they could not stand being there ... ... But I remember being in my room, listening play ... ... And it sounded as if he had come the cavalry, the Red Cross ... It was a breath of air very exciting ... I think I never had to strain both to play ... ... Trying to seek the return to see how to play better than ever ... ... How to do ... Do not think we needed say between us ... ... Just remember ... ... Thinking: "How I can do this better? " And I remember thinking, "This is the best fucking music heard in my life. " "This is like getting on a Camaro and step on the throttle ... " "... As much as possible ..." "This is what I need right now ". I just ... you know ... ...

He forced some people ... ... At us with us and celebrate that we had about ... ... We had a family, a community to overcome ... ... The fact that you lost ... Ten years ago we came ... ... Palestrina with Morphine ... Instead of separate, we became closer ... People depending on each other more ... ... Helping to pass what It was a bad time for all ... ... Everywhere ... "Mark is gone ..." Why? Why so much tragedy ...? ?... In a family? It is inconceivable ... I always thought that one of the things most striking of his music was ... ... Sorry ... We knew this was a special place ... ... But did not know how special sacred and would end up being ... Were we surprised by its success? Yes ... Were we happy? Yes ... We were very soprendidos after he died ... ... See how many magazines and newspapers talking about him ... ... Praising his career ... ... On which we knew very little ... His parents did not understand emotional connections ... ... They were quite disconnected ... And part of me felt how Billy and Dana ... ... They approached them had so much love ... ... With such deference ... ... With such open hearts, and I thought ... "These are two guys They were like brothers to Mark ... " "It's an opportunity to think a beautiful bond with these two men ... " "... Who loved his son ..." Especially having lost just three children ... But it was a ridiculously thought How romantic ... it occurred to me ...? ?... That something so beautiful could happen? It is interesting how, over the years, the different things that people say ... ... And the things one is remembering in your mind ... ... I think I could never stop thinking as Joe Strummer once said: "If you're a musician ..." "... And you love what you do ..." "... And your time comes ..." "... While you're doing what you love, in a beautiful location, on a beautiful night ... " "... What better obituary, right?" When we lost Mark, you hugged us ... ...
