That's enough, Ma. Ah Chung, what will be your major? I am planning to study Medicine. Good, how about maternity? This subject will allow you to touch a lot of girls. You dirty old man. I think Law is better. I can beat the guy I don't like. If he charges me, you can help me. You all are stupid, I think Maths is the best. If he makes clear the possibility, we can win in every kind of gambling. Don't listen your brother's words, be good. I think it's not a matter what I study. If I do it Well, I can wear the gown. Take a blonde girl home. Our parents will lose face if you do. Don't worry, I will return after I finish studying. And the first thing is to cure Ma's kidney. - What a cleaver boy. - Brother, you are jealous. Why? How about father's pimple. Go to eat. Honey, you clothes is broken. Because Uncle and I went to catch Shing. I broke it carelessly, they were so dare. They fought with us. Luckily, Uncle is smart. One against nine, no one can fight with him. Right, uncle? It's okay, eat, eat. Master, take a piece of chicken. It's the rump. I change it. Sister, bring Master a cup of tea. What's up? Where's the sample? - In the drawer. - Thank you. Little beautiful girl. Please don't, boss. He always does. You don't know because you're new. He is a dirty old man. What's matter? This guy... Brother, Allan's afraid becomes worse. I think he has to hide away. This matter hurts me. But if he didn't do, who would do? Old Mark requested me to take care of Allan. But I can't protect him this time. How can face our brother again? I will retire next year and open a small restaurant. You will retire too. Yes, I am too old. I am old now. I've seen your beginning of being a cap. And promotion. Now you are retired. - Good bye. - Pa. Ah Hua, some guys charge against your factory of Tai Fu Building. They are very fierce, you better go to see. If not, I don't know how to do. - I know. - Good bye. ICAC is watching them, uncle Fung's income is out. They won't be safe even without ICAC. Uncle Fung is very friendly. You help him to find a place for his retirement. I know. - Ah Mo, start! - Good! Let us research now. How to put our business on road. It's not necessary, take them away. We're used to the old way. Legal business, we've to bear the rude manner of employee. Also the customer. Then, what do you think? Dam it, I've followed their order to make clothes. They all reject because the buttons are wrong. They returned all goods, damn it. If you don't come, I will kill them. You're too rude, we are doing the legal business. Be gentle, and if something wrong, you should tackle the problem by law. You can't fight like the past. Why do I let Ai Chung to study in England. I want to let other people know. We're not just to use our hands to fight and kill, but also to help other people. We can't be cruel in this society now. That's why I want you be a good man. Brother-in-law, you mean we've to start again. Right, I will spend two years, to plan for the future. How's the matter of Golden Teeth Shing? Drugs runner, I've destroyed him. I didn't ask you, Ai Hua, you say... Golden Teeth Shing is dead. And Big brother has destroyed all his places. And also burnt all drugs, I think he is finished. Good work, so do you. Ai Yip. How's about the strike of wharf workers? - Not yet. - Of course not. You spend all day on gambling. I tell you, if you fail again. This matter will be passed to your Uncle. And the business of Lung family is not yours. Nothing else. Go out. I am out. Ai Hua, how's Allan? Brother has already arranged, he'll leave tonight. Ai Sik, police is watching on him, be careful. Don't worry, I will take him by boat. No problem. I've prepared the documents and cash. I know. And, tell them. Next time when Ai Yip has debt. We are not responsible. Pa. Don't say anymore, we've to be serious, to save the guy. Money and documents are inside, when you reach Taiwan, he will send you more. Father is good to me. This time you leave, we all miss you. Fool, Taiwan is very near to Hong Kong. After I leave, take care of father. Father is coming. Pa, Uncle. Pa. Brother Sik. This is from Ma and me. Thank you, you two are so good to me. Allan, even though you're not belonged to Lung. I treat you as my son. This time you go to Taiwan, do the work you think fit. Try to stay there... Don't worry, I know how to do. I will extend our force on there. Try to be strong Lung's family there. Allan, Life in triad is bad, you see. You've got involved for few decades, just hope for quiet moment. I can't been with you now. Just hide in Taiwan. This living is not good for you. The matter of Golden Teeth Shing is a final. - But, Pa... - Allan. Don't worry, we will take care of everything. Young man, go. Go. The matter of Golden Teeth Shing, I've warned him. He didn't listen, so I executed the regulations without meeting. Bro. Ying, we'll absolutely obey you. Golden Teeth Shing this guy, has already neglected us. His brother White Wolf has spoiled him. Their fellows are fierce. They even occupy my places. How dare they are. - Brother. - Hi. Brother. Brother... Ho E, sit. Brother, you should teach your fellows. My fellows. They are disciplined. How many fellows are in trouble? I've been in Philippines for two weeks. Let them under the control of Golden Teeth Shing, If anything wrong, they will inform me. This is Golden Teeth Shing's matter. What's matter? He sells drugs. Damn it, Ai Ko, send him back. Brother, I've cleaned up our family. What did you say? You think all your fellows is obeyed to you? Even if not, it's not your business. This is my business. It is also belonged to the four big families. We've sworn not to run drugs. If any one does, we'll execute our family law. I am the head, let me handle this case. Even if you want to kill him, give me face. Wait till I return. I've found you everywhere. The guy is dead, there's no evidence. How if you two are partners. Brother, beware of your words. Be careful? It's obvious you two are partners. I've to check it out. If it's true, we will wait and see the result. Don't be angry. We've said you are drugs-trafficker. That's what you think in your minds. Brother, don't be unreasonable. How do I? Let's parted away. Ai Ko, hand the account of the 'Four Big Families'. We're parted now, let's go. Brother, brother... Lung Ying this bastard, he wants to swallow me. Don't think I am a kind person. Something wrong, Ai Ko. Call Ai Keung back by long distance call. Brother. What did you do? Nothing, nothing. Help me to call Ai Keung back. Check Golden Teeth, see it's true or not. Yes, brother, I want to take off here. Ai Bill, stop, let me take off here. - Brother Sik. - Why do you come back? I want to talk with Big Brother. Looking for Big Brother, wait. Brother-in-law, Ai Ko wants to see you. Let him in. Ai Ko, hurry up. - Brother. - What's matter? I am wrong, Brother, please help me. I am not capable of doing the account well. Five million dollar has been lost. Brother White asks me to hand the account out. But I can't. You blame me, blame me. This is the matter of the "Four Big Families". We will discuss how to treat you. Brother, I don't want to die, I am afraid. But it's not my fault. How can you be sure? If I did, I won't get back and see you. My mother is 70 year old, she is sick. If I die, no one will take care of her. Ai Ko, I've known you since you were child. I know quite well, no matter who stole the money. I don't want you die, no one is perfect. The important thing is to correct. Okay, I give you two weeks, to check it out. Remember, you should be fair. Yes brother,I will check it out as soon as possible. - Go out. - Yes. Thanks a lot. Brother Keung, something wrong. Don't tell me till we are home. Ah Chuen. Brother Ko, Keung is back. Take care of his luggage. Ai Wan, take me two bottles of bear. Also see if the kitchen has something to eat. Brother Keung, we've to hand out 5 million dollar next week. And the drugs of Golden Teeth are destroyed. The old man said if we can't hand out next week, he will punish us. Not me, only you. What, you've spent the money. Don't be so loudly. At least, White Wolf and the Head will know. So we've to assassinate the two old men. How can we do? Use your brain, stupid! Right, do you have any idea? Any Cigarette? Close the door. Mr. Chan, do you go ahead? Seventy thousand, go. A-9. Sorry, three two. Boss, Bor. Keung wants to see you. Damn, I've won for a long time. - Tips. - Thank you. Change to cash. Excuse me, everybody. Ai Keung, what are you doing? It's very hard for me to win a little tonight. And you have stopped me. Congratulations, we've opened for a long time. You've won at least, how much did you win? Just forty thousand only. $400,000, that's good, after deducting. You still have owed me 3 million and sixty thousand. When will you refund to me? Ai Ko, you don't believe on me. Not me, it's your father. He isn't responsible for the debts you owe. And White Wolf is against your father. This is his area, he said, you have to refund the money soon. Don't worry, I will be responsible. Nonsense, how much money you earn a month? About thirty thousand dollar. It's not even enough for you to drink. Ai Yip, are we still brother? Right. Do you want me to speak out the truth? Speak out. Sons of Lung's family are very smart, and you are the worst, no one believe you. You know why? The reasons is that you don't have position in Lung's family. You just in charge of the rotten container wharf. You are useless, I have a way to be rich. There will have stuffs after two days, I want to borrow your wharf, it's good to you. And you can refund all your debts. What stuffs? Of course not the good things, it's heroin. Drugs, I don't do this business. - How can I help you? - You repay all your debts tomorrow. Don't treat me like that. If my father find it, he will kill me. Ai Yip think about if White Wolf asks your Dad to refund you debts. You are surely dead, then why don't you try. Only three of us know this matter. No one will know. You words are very beautiful. Don't hesitate, If we success, you will have a lot of money. You will have reputation outside. Ai K0. - Give him forty thousand he won. - 0.K. That's the deal. Okay, only this time. One is enough, go to drink. Bless our success. Ma, Ai Chung is studying, don't worry. Come, take a picture. Stand there, good, one more. Look at here. Move all out. Don't drink too much soft drinks there. Don't eat too much fried food. - Ma, I know. - Go to sleep early. Don't worry, everything is okay. Be good. Ma, let us take a picture. Take a picture. Good, come. Boss, are they? Right, put them on the car. Ai Chung, where do you go? Any one hurts you in China town, mention my name. Good. Ai Chung, don't listen your brother's words.

I will be there punctually. Ai Po, find the guys out. Yes, master. I have said that we retreat from the triad. No more triad activities, they don't listen. We the "Four Big Families" have sworn not to run drugs. However, Ai Yip is running drugs, our reputation is hurt by him. Pa, you know our characters well. Even though elder brother enjoys gambling. He won't be a drugs-trafficker. Right, Pa, I know him well. He's very frank, and if he run drugs, he won't owed a lot of debts. He won't borrow one or two thousand from me. Will White Wolf trick him? Pa, maybe it relate to the matter of Golden Teeth. - They forced him to do so. - Right. Pa, I go to get them out immediately. Don't go, they've appointment with me at midnight. In the farm of the Peak. That's good, we all go to there. Require them to hand Ai Yip out. This is their trick, don't go. I go with your uncle and Uncle Po. Stay at home, don't go away. Pa. Ai Sik, stay here, don't go. With Ai Po is enough. Take care. Brother, Hung Chi Tai is coming. Brother... Ho San, Ho Sze. See our Big Brother. Brother Lung. How are you? I am fine. It's not fair.

Right, I nearly forget you boss is powerful. Respectable, Brother, I am sorry. Am I come here to see your acting? Of course not. Actually, you should act to me. - Take him out. - Yes. Pa, Pa. My men ran drugs, you executed the law alone. Now your son is a drugs-trafficker, so what? Execute the regulations yourself. Pa. Master. Pa... Pa, don't. - Master. - Brother. Master. I am alright. Since I, Lung Ying, have joined the triad. Everybody knows our family do not run drugs. My son is useless, but, I know he is no courage to run drugs. I am sure he is cheated. I hope you give two days, let me make clear this matter. I will find the head, and my son to execute the regulations. Two days is enough for him to escape to the U.S.A. How can you guarantee? My dragon head. Don't think you can protect your son. Did you give time to Golden Teeth? Hurt you intentionally. What did you say? Get out. How dare you say to get out? My brother lost his face. You're not qualified to be the head of the "Four Big Families". My brother is qualified. Lung Ying, be polite. You are too much. You bastard. You remember what you said when you knelt before me? What did you say? I Knelt before you? Ka Wai. Where is father? He's inside. Let him inside alone, how if it is dangerous. Ka Wai, you father lets us get inside. If I do cover the truth, you can't stay alive till now. You bastard. What do you want? Swallow me up? Be careful, master. You bastard, you want to hurt father. Ka Wai. - Pa. - Be careful. How are you? Is it alright? Nothing. - I kill you. - Young master. - Young master. - Ai Po. - Young master. - Release me. Don't let him free. Don't move, don't be so close. Ai Ko, what are you doing? Don't move or I kill him. Damn, release my father. Or I kill you. Ai Ko, clam down. Release me first or no one will protect you. Brother, tell him to release the head. Or we all have trouble. Ai Ko, don't threat old people. If something happens, I can't protect you. Ai Ko, don't be angry, release the head. Release him, let us forget the past. Okay, take off all your pants. Damn you! Young master, don't be silly. Be quick, take off the pants. I revenge on you bastard. Be quick, take off the pants. Take it, take it. Also the underwear, take it off. Ai Sik, take it off.

Ai Ko have helped you to have a merit. What merit? Brother, you think of the head of the "Four Big Families" for a long time. The date is coming soon. Shatchow gangs and Shanghai gangs are not willing to help me. Even if they are willing, the son of Lung Ying will not agree. Ai Ko and I have already thought about it. H OW? Extinguish him. Brother, let us destroy all his men. H OW? With Shatchow and Shanghai gangs, they're finished. And no one is able to compete with you. The world is belonged to you. Brother, cheers. It's too large for me to drink. You can. It's difficult to be a brother of triad. Not everyone can drink this wine. Only if he's qualified. Guests ready. Relatives send their regards. First bow.
