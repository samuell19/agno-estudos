"This is the Reload House." "Make your 10 second video on the Reload app," "tweet the hashtag Reload, and you gonna win some sick Beats headphones!" Yo, how we feeling? Put your hands together if you were born in the 90's! Hey baby, yeah. Danimals, I'll grab 'em. "I know what you are thinking: What's this old piece of shit" "doing at a party full of promising millennials?" "Look at all these young people." "Prime of their life with their vape pens and their drones," "taking selfies, doing things better than I ever did." "I mean, I can't even figure out snapchat." "I have no Idea how it works." "Six months ago, I got in on an App called Reload" "in hopes of internet fame" "and so I can quit my crappy job." "I mean look at me! Look at that line on my face." "Right there, on the left side of my face. You see it?" "It looks like a bunch of scrotum skin." "That's what these young people think when they look at me." "Hey, there's the old guy with balls on his face." Hey! Shut it off! Hey! Turn it off! Look at all you dipshits! Staring into your phone, like a bunch of lemmings. We are headed down the road of technological suicide! Shut up. But good news. It's not too late, because I still see the beauty in all of us! It's time now for the Reload's twerk contest! Alright! Hey. The winner gets to be on the front page of Reload. Hey, get out of the way. Hey, you're alright? Stop filming! Yo, shout out if you're high as fuck right now! Heads up, we got angels. - You saved my life. - The next contestant for comedian on Reload, and he's ancient as shit. Sam Douglas! I gotta go, I'm in this twerk contest. What? I came to beat this girl's ass. "Anyway, things have changed." "I used to perform standups to ten people per night." "Now I chase followers and humiliate myself." "God! I should've taken that job with my father-in-law's" "dry wall business. He makes good money." Sure you want to do this? My kid needs those headphones, Todd. You ain't a lady, bitch! Faggot! "All I ever wanted was to be good at something." "But that's life, cruel as hell." "You wait around in your 20's and 30's for something good to happen," "and then one day, you wake up" "and piss keeps coming out of your dick, even after you zipped up your pants." Let's be honest, this is exactly what we thought would happen. "As I laid on the ground, one thing was for sure," "the future was here, and I never saw it coming." "This is my social media story." "FML." "Fuck my life." Hey. - Hi. - Hey daddy. Daddy, are you gonna be here for my birthday party? I wouldn't miss it for the world. - I love you. - I love you too. I'll see you soon, okay? Hey. You working? Good. "The best way to get more followers, is to collab with other people." "You get on their page, they get on yours," "and everybody goes up." "His name is Henry Fillmore, and he is a genius at the internet," Oh my god, you smoke? Don't you know that those can kill you? Yeah, that's kinda the point. Tryna speed this shit up. "He's also an arrogant dick." That's not good. Yo, yo! What's up my brother? How's it going? Sorry so early. That's a great post we had last week, huh? Well, you know. I don't mind coming down here. Yeah. I can't believe you have a million followers, but you don't drive. I can't believe you are 50, and still hanging out with a teenager. Yeah, that's a good one. No, but seriously. Just... I thought before we get started this week, we could just get to know each other a little bit, you know? Okay, let me start. Um... You are married in a midlife crisis, so you couldn't cut it in standups. So now you are shitting your pants, hoping this whole internet fame thing works out, before your wife and kids lose respect for you completely. - Is that about right? Did I get that? - Yeah. Slow down! You're gonna hit somebody! Dad, we haven't even started the car yet, so... Watch out! There is someone coming this way! "Slow down, you're gonna hit somebody." Oh my god, were number one. Yup. That right there is what the kids call: Heat. Nice. Yeah. So when I see you next time, I'll gonna be like... - Yo, Henry. Got any heat? - Jesus Christ. Did you see what was number one on the comedy page yesterday? It was a video of a fifteen year old girl farting on her newborn baby sister. This App is just wall to wall garbage now. Why do people degrade themselves on the internet? - What are you doing? What is that? - Nothing, we'll do that later. And do you know what's weird? All these people care about is followers and money. Like I had this Asian guy call me yesterday, he wanted me to eat Pizza on Reload for four grand. You said yes, right? No, I'm not a sellout. I think about deleting my account every single day. Well, If you hate it so much, then why do you do it? So I can afford getting into film school, and... - This is all I really got right now. - Henry. - Did you take the trash out yet? - I did, Mitch. Did you get your check form Game Buddies yet? Not yet, Mitch. What's your deal? You tryna fuck him? Oh, me? No. - I'm a father. - Yeah. He's a father. Like a real father. - Not a step-father. - Hey, shit stain. While you live in this house, you'll do what I say. And you, I got my eye on you. I would love for you to have your eye on me. - You should follow me. - Follow you where? Back to your van? Never mind. Yeah, don't worry about it. Fucking losers. Henry! Henry, yes! Henry! My bad. - Baby. - Hi. - Hey. - Hey. - Guess what? - I don't know, what? - I got heat. - Wow. Okay, don't know what that means exactly. But it sounds exciting, - and I'm proud of you. - Yeah, it's really good. - How are you? - I'm okay. I'm tired. Will you put those cupcakes out for me? And you can't eat one. - Don't eat one. - Sure. - Don't eat one. No! - Just... - What? Are we gonna wrestle? Are we... - No. Sam. Sam! - No, you're not eating it. - Come to me. I think one of the kids will be gluten free. There's always a gluten-free kid. But I... We can't afford it. We can't afford this house. We can't afford... - No, no. - Okay, so this is what I wanted to talk to you about. I think we should think about leaving LA No, no. That's... That's insane. - We have a great life here. - No, I know. We have a great life here, but we can a great, less expensive life somewhere else. I'm just... I'm sick of working double shifts. And you know what? I wanna to be somewhere quiet. Okay? Triage at 3 in the morning is not very chill. Okay, listen. I've been thinking, alright? And I want to go head first into this social media thing. It's gonna be big. - I mean, it's already big. But... - Check it out. If I can get a million followers... - Just a million? - Yeah, that's not that much. We could do that. You can help. If I can get a million followers, I can get brand deals. Okay? I know a guy, he made 500 thousand dollars last year. - And he's a moron. - So you're qualified for this job? Yeah, exactly. I mean, when you went to Burning man to sell jewelry, I supported you. I know, that was so stupid too. Because we didn't know people don't bring money to burning man, - They just wanna barter and... - And now we know, you know? I just feel like we're getting too old to be doing this kind of thing. No, we're not too old. We're never too old. You look great, I go to spin. We're good, really. OK, I just need a little bit of time, okay? Just a little bit of time. - We're a team, right? - Of course we're a team. - We've always been a team. - I'm the team captain. That's right, and I'm the coach. - Hello. - Hi. What are you talking my sister into now? Where do you come from? Is there a bulkhead I don't know about? Or... Sam thinks he can get a million followers on that App he's obsessed with. Then you gotta stop it with the Hollywood career stuff. You have to take your dreams, and you gotta put'em in a sack - and drown them in a well. - That's very graphic. Well, I did it, and it worked for me. - I have a very nice life. - You quit. - Just stop. - You just gave up and live with Brad... Brad is very nice. He's stable. We have a time share. I really think Sam can do it. I do, I believe in him. We're a team, and that's what team members do. - They support their team. - You are just enabling him. Do not middle finger me! Why don't you try getting a real job? I have a real job, thank you very much. Yup, I go in four days a week. Half day on Wednesday. Hey. You're in a good mood for someone who just had their nose ripped off. Oh my god! Is that Sam Douglas from Reaload? Can I meet him? Oh my god! Sam, this patient would like to meet you. She knows you from Reload. She is very excited to meet you. Hey, I'm Sam. - Hi, nice to meet you. - I love your Reloads. Thank you so much for saying that, It makes my day. But I gotta go, it was so nice to meet you. - Can I speak with you? - Yeah, it's not a big deal. It is kinda of a big deal, okay? We talked about these videos. I don't like you making these videos. Because it feels like it kinda undermines what I'm doing. Don't you feel like you're sort of outshining me? I don't feel like it really affects your thing at all. You know I'm pitching a reality show to the Skin network? I know, I heard about... How's it coming? It's coming good. I'm waiting for the producer's son to get out of college. Get out of rehab, and then get out of college. - And he's gonna make a sizzle reel... - Oh, Ben is in rehab? Yeah, but it's fine. It's not a big deal. Just coke and stuff, you know? - He's gonna be fine. - I don't think I wanna be... In a reality show about... - Plastic surgery. - What does that mean? I think people are sort of beautiful as they are. - So, that's how... Yeah, I mean. - Really? - People are beautiful as they are? - Yeah. Let me disabuse you of that notion, okay? Did you see this girl's nose when she came in here? It was disgusting. That nose was truly horrific to look at. - I thought she looked fine. - She looked horrible. Oh my god! You thought I looked okay? Oh no. I look like my dad, which is why he paid for this one. For a father to look at his daughters face and see his own hideous nose on it? That's why he paid for the surgery. And once the healing is done, you're gonna look so good... She's gonna be beating them off with a stick. Stop. Stop that. I will not stop, 'cause it's true. You're fired. Oh no, Todd. Come one man. You know... You know Amanda and I... We really need the money. I'm sorry, but you just told me to my face that you don't really respect what I do. - So I need to let you go. - Okay. Yeah. I was gonna make you a co-star of my reality show, and you blew it. Alright, let's take care of those lips, they're awful. Hey, what's up baby bro? Guess who just got back from prison? Why don't you check out this sweet anklet? Get off me! Man, you look like a gazelle right now. Thanks. Hey, can you run to the store for me? Yo! I'll cruise with. I need some scratchers and a pack of cancer sticks. You can't leave the house Jeff. Damn this sweet anklet. I keep forgetting. Henry, you got your check from Game Buddies yet? No, I didn't get the check. Okay? Listen, Henry. I'm so grateful for that Game Buddy salary, because lord knows it has kept this family afloat, right. But you're gonna have to pick up some more hours now that you are supporting Jeff. Plus, big news. Mitch and I are saving for some sweet windsurfers. It's the fusion of surf and wind. What is this? Film school pamphlet? Throw this away. Okay, why am I the only person in this house with a job? - I so want out of this family. - Okay, well then you go. You go. You get out of here like your daddy did! Jesus! Ungrateful. Nice one. Jeff forgot about his anklet again. What? Is he like a dog? How did we not see him leave? Henry, you need to go follow him before the police finds him. Jesus! Do we have any gin? "Hey, Henry. What's up?" "If you're ever in New York, you know you gotta hit me up. Right?" "Hey Henry, what's up?" "If you're ever in New York, you know you gotta hit me up. Right?" - I fucking hate you, Mitch. - And I fuckin love my new closet. Number one again, gramps. I reposted it for you. I said, number one again gramps. Did you hear me? That's great, Henry. - What's up? - Nothing. Hey! You don't get to be depressed. That's what I do. If we're both depressed, we'll wind up hanging in our garages somewhere or something. Things are bad, Henry. Got fired. My family's got no money. And I'm wasting my time on an App full of handsome tweens. Yeah, I hear ya. Bunch of talentless hacks. And they're everywhere. In every city and every state. Just a ton of these fucking kids. One minute they're working the fry basket and the next minute, they're ziplining with Justin Beiber. It's like... Hey, what... What if I collab with them? - They don't live here. - I know, but what If I went to them? - What if we went to them? - No. - Yes. Look, - No, I'm not doing that. Every time we make a video together, we get more followers. If we went to all of them, we clean up. And you just need me because you don't have enough followers, right? No. Okay, yes. Fine. But we're a great team. It will be a road trip. Like Thelma and Louise. Thelma and Louise commit suicide at the end of that movie. - What? - Yeah. - No. - Did you not know that? I never saw the end. That is so dark. Yeah, it's a really dark movie. Henry, come on. You gotta get out of this town. We gonna stay here and be with Mitch and Pam? You didn't even know what Hummus was! I had to tell you. Okay, a lot of people don't know what a Hummus is. Henry, look. I'm a 40-year old with no job prospects, okay? Every day I wonder why my wife hasn't left me. Think about my kids. - So we go to New York? - Yeah, why? What's in New York? - Henry. - What? - Where is you Game Buddy check? - I don't know. You tell me, you're the one holding the mail. - Hey. - What? - The check here? - I don't know. Ask Mitch. - Henry! Where's the check? - What? - I don't know! - Mitch! - Where is the check? - It's not here. Well, check. Maybe it's in there. It's not though. It's just a bunch of bills on our Wind Boarder subscription. Okay. If you get me out of here, - I will do whatever you want. - Really? - Yeah, but we have to leave now though. - Let's go. - Yeah, let's go. - It's great. Hey Mitch. I wouldn't expect a Game Buddy's check in the mail any time soon. So have fine signing up for unemployment, you fucking turd. Shit!. I mean, it's summer time. So, you should be able to make a really good dent. - All the kids are out of school, right? - Yeah. You are incredible. I cannot thank you enough. I know, you're right. You're the best, I love you so much. Oh god! I love you too. And I know I'm the best, you're right. - I am. I am the best. - Henry! Okay. Henry seems like he is a little bit of a project. Henry, they just wanted to play. - I don't like kids. - Well, they don't like you either. Never mind, I like her. She's cool. So, Henry, um... Sam told me that you really want to be a filmmaker, So I dug out our super 8 camera. And I though you could take it on the trip and like, make little movies. - This is really old. - Yes. Yeah. My phone has a way better camera than this. Check this out. Got us a couple of T-shirts. - Huh? Like the movie. - It's cute. How much did you spend on these? - These were... These were a lot. - Oh, a lot? It was a rush shop. I spelled it wrong over the phone. - We'll get it fixed. - Are you excited about the trip? I mean... Yeah, it's whatever. I mean, It'll be nice to get out of Game Buddies. And what do you think about Sam getting a million followers? Oh no, it's not... That's not gonna happen. - It's cute though. - Why don't you just get in the car? Okay, I'll get in the car. It was nice meeting you. - Nice to meet you. - Yeah. - I love you. Oh my god! - I love you so much. Oh god! Okay, bye. Bye kids, I love you. Okay. I'll call you. What? Why is the bag there? It was the closest thing to me. I didn't want to throw... - How am I supposed to sit when... - Can you put it in the back? - Drive safe honey. - You ready? - Sure. - Say bye, daddy. It's gonna be... pretty great. - Bye you guys, see you later. - See you the fuck later. - Shit, fuck! - I mean, really? It's too late, it's like already happened. Damage is done. Man! Out on the road, huh? Is this great? Are you feeling it? Alright. I've set up collabs across the country. Once I hit a million, you go home. Quit Game Buddies, and enroll in film school. I save my family from poverty, and tell my sister-in-law, Glenn, to fuck off. - What's that? - This? This is a CB. You can have your fancy GPS, but you're only gonna get the truth about the roads on this little bad boy. "Breaker 1-9, this Hound dog." "Looking to get my dick sucked and my balls cradled." - Maybe shut that off. - We're good on that, thanks. - Not gonna need that. - I don't wanna talk to that guy again. - That's for sure. - Yeah, we better watch out. Rest stop safety for sure. 'Cause if youre in a rest stop and you hear this... In the stall, they're not looking for toilet paper. I was on a trip with my family. We saw Grand Canyon. And sure enough, I'm in there taking a leak, and then all of a sudden... a one-eyed, one-horse flying purple people eater just looking at me. - You know what I'm saying? - And.... Big trucker cock. You saw a glory hole? That's what they're called. I don't know, there was nothing glorious about it. Just a hole with a dick in it. Alright, first collab. Man! - Nice place. - Yeah. It's gonna be us one day, dude. After our trip. "Too many titties in this club." "Too many titties in this club." - Jesus Christ. Who is this? Macklemore? - Oh shit! Oh my god! Swag got visitors dude. - That's what's up! - Come back to bed, Swaggy. Maybe we should come back another time? No bitch! They part of the Swag army dude. 3 million strong. "And rising every day." Damn! That was freaking fresh. That deserves a selfie. Selfie Swag! Bam! And I nailed it. That shit, Oh my god. Put that shit on the cloud. Oh damn. - Oh shit. - She has a broken leg. Don't mind her, she fell of a rood. I pushed her. She cool. Ay yo, what do you think of my girls? They twins. One's 17, and one's 18. - That's not possible. - You got me.

A new Saturn with rings around that shit? Swag! It's all Swag dude. Multiple phones, multiple uploads. - That's a lot of phones. - Make that cash, get that ass. You know what I'm saying dude? - How did you get so many followers? - Oh my god, sit down dude. - How do you not know that shit? - This is nice. My roommate created Reload, man.

Are you fucking kidding me? - Look at your face. - Stupid white face. - Hey. - "The kids and I have been" "watching every single day." "You are doing so great, the plan is working." I know. At this rate, I'll be home in a week. - "What's going on there?" - Not much, everything is pretty good. Oh god! I'm just a little stressed and my eczema is acting up. I have to not scratch it. My god! So Jake talked Enzel into jumping off our roof into the pool so he can film it. Then he like, set the whole thing to trap music, and uploaded it to Youtube. I mean... - Oh yeah?

The fact that you said that, make me not want to go in there. - Why would you say that? - Forget I said that. Just slipped out? It felt like you took time with that. Scar hasn't texted me back in like 3 days. There's a lot of girls right here, okay? See those two girls right there? You go over there. Tell them I'm married with kids, and that you want to party. Yeah, it's a real panty dropper. - Hi. - Hi. Me and my friend were wondering what you guys are up to. I mean, I personally don't give a shit. But he cares, so. Is that your dad? No, it's not. No. Oh wait, are you guys looking at colleges? No, he can't set foot on a collage legally. Ladies. Dem outfits looking on fleech. - Jesus. - Yeah, no? Hey, stop texting. It's rude. Fuck you. Why don't you go and fuck off? - I'm gonna text, if I want to text. - You fuck off. - No you fuck off. - Fuck off. I'm fucking sick of you. I'm sick of you. I will fucking end you. I'll let you end me so I can end you. How's that? Did you just say you will let me end you? What the fuck man? I don't... Come here. Excuse us for one second. - You are the worst wingman. - It's been a while, okay? Now stand back so I can save your ass. What are you gonna do? I'm starting a dance party. It's not the 70's anymore, Sam. You can't just press a button on a jukebox and every one goes insane. Doesn't work like that anymore. Oh shit! - Feeling this? - No. - Because I am. - I'm not feeling it all. I'm feeling less things now. He's going through a mid-life crisis I came in second in a twerk contest. Your dad is so cute. Oh gosh! - Wait, what are you... - Are we gonna kiss or what? Wait, I have a girlfriend. I mean, kinda. We haven't... Slow down, speed racer. What are you doing? That was the best thing I ever experienced. What's up? Oh yeah? How old are you? Nineteen? What? Stay out. I'm just on... Hey dude. You made out. I'm sorry. "Did you know wrestling is fake?" "Did you know Santa Clause doesn't exist?" "Hey, come on. Don't ever say that." "That one's hard." - Hello? - "Sam." Bobby Fellows here from Digibrand. I've been following the tour. You guys are killing it. You guys hungry? Let me send you some soup? Let me send you some soup. - We're in the car right now. - I'll mail it out, what's the address? - Hey, write down the address. - "What?" - It's changing every second. - Sam, I want to rep you. I want to bring you into the Digibrand fold. - I can start getting you deals, today. - Oh my god. - No, no. please don't. - This is happening, this is it. - Don't cry. No. - Oh my god. - Oh god! - "Social media, Sam." "It's the gold rush." I just got a kid 8000 dollars for a car deal. He's five. I had to explain to him what money is. Hey, Henry! You thinking more about that burger ad? You thinking more about that dick I told you to eat? Loved that! Loved that. Listen, I got you guys 4000 a piece for an energy drink. You heard of Satan's D? - Wait, I thought that was illegal. - "Oh no, it's back." Turns out those kids were on meth. So it was the meth causing that was causing the cluttered IV's, and not Satan's D. Listen, "I got you a collab with this girl. She got 2.9 million followers." And a great set of tits. I mean, these things... You've seen them. Oh man, they're... "These things are really superb." - I don't do brands. - I'll do it. I'll take it, if he doesn't. It's gotta be both of you. They love the young guy slash really old guy thing you guys got going on. Hey Bobby, I'm gonna mute you for a second. - What are you doing? - Okay, I know this guy - is a total piece of shit. - Yeah. - Dregs of society. - Yeah. - Big time ball of dick and balls. - Lower than shit. But this is two-months salary of Game Buddies. "Didn't mute it, still hear." But I love it. Love the humor, love the way you guys riff. Do you want to lose your virginity with an Instagram model, or not? Wait, how did you know I was a virgin? - Yeah, no secret bud. - Yeah, see? Alright, I'll do it. We'll do it buddy. We're on our way. I'll send paper work. - Last chance on that soup. - We don't want your fuckin soup, Bobby. What is wrong with this guy? What is wrong with him? I don't know. I'll take some soup. Well, I suppose we should try it. - I guess. Let's give it a shot. - Yeah? - Here we go. Ready? - Yup, ready. And here we go. - Oh god! - That's awful. Tastes like Christiano Ronaldo's taint. Tastes like, Bill Cosby made you a drink and you knew it was bad right away. And then he raped you. Tastes like Donald Trump's neck fat. Tastes like the time I was... In summer camp, and then this kid pissed in my mouth. - And I never told anyone about it. - Oh my god! - Hey guys - Hey. Oh my god. I love you guys, you're my favorite. - Yeah. - Such a fan, I love you guys. - Yeah. - Seriously, like you're so funny. I know you always talk about your girlfriend, but deep down, you're so lonely. It's funny, because I've seen your videos. And I know that deep down - I know you're not funny. - I don't get it. He's joking. - Why are we in a hospital? - Cuz there is like a cancer kid here. I've been bummed, I've been telling my publicist that. - Bublisistant. - I'm her publisistant. It's like publicist, but assistant combined. And I just feel like, I just really want to give back. You know what I mean? Like, I've been thinking too much about myself, so... Be a better person, you know what I mean? - Smile. - And like, yeah. So. And it's not... You know, it's not always about me. Like, laying down tracks of Pharrell. Or like, creating my own line of hangover medicine. It's really about me just wanting to separate from... - Be a better person. -Be a better person. - It's like a puppet. - Cuz I'm an example. - You know? It's like... - Yeah. Just... People are watching. Millions are watching. - Millions! - Plus, sick-kid crazy likes Yeah. I got a matzo ball soup for Sam Henry. Hi Dominic. We're here from Reload. Don't fucking talk to me like that. I got the big C, and this is the best you can do? A bunch of people who downloaded an App? Wow, you're being really mean for being so tiny. You're pretty pasty for being an internet star. - Dominic is doing quite well actually. - Fuck you, Sandra. - I love you too. - Don't fucking touch me. You said you're going to bring me porn. And also another thing, don't bring your fucking annoying ass nephew here next time. You can't expect me to play with him. - Well, I... Okay. - I'm the sick one. - He's the healthy one, fuck him. - Okay. I have some porn, if you want... - We could probably get you some. - That's not appropriate. - You shouldn't get him porn. - No, no. okay, never mind. Dominic, we want to put you in a video. Would you like that? Me? Hey kids! Time for your Satan's D! Thanks dad. Suck that D. - I got a raise. - I joined the liquesce team. I killed a drifter, and ate his soul. - My god, that's hilarious. - Yeah, that's good. - Oh my god, I'm dying right now. - Yeah. - It's really good. Dying. - It's amazing. Yeah. Oh shit. All we can do now is just, pray for the best. - Yeah, yeah. Pray for the best. - Yeah. - And we defiantly can't upload that. - Oh no. - Can't do it, no. No. - No. Not uploading that - It's not about that anymore. - No. It's not about that video. - I just hope he is okay. - You can post it if he lives though. - Yeah, yeah. We can do that. - Yeah, yeah. - Absolutely, yeah. - Yeah. No. If he lives, definitely. Cuz it's like, you know... - Good videos. - Yeah. - Hard to come by. - Exactly. But if he dies, I mean, we can make like a tribute video. - Oh, there's an idea. - I like that. Put like, "In Memoriam". And put like, put Enya underneath I like that, that's really good. Yeah. - Dominc is gonna be okay. - Upload that shit! Already posted it. Hey! You're breaking up, I can't... I can't hear you so well. 14 more days. We're almost there, we're half way there. I'm counting them down. - I really miss you guys. - Really? Because, I feel like we haven't been really hearing from you very much. I know, it's been just so hard. With the time change and being on the road. Yeah, bad. I mean... - It kinda looks like you're having fun. - Fun? No. - I wouldn't call this fun. - "Well." I mean, it's probably better than being stuck in a house with two kids home for the summer that have nothing to do. Well, it's all gonna be worth it babe. You'll see. I'm telling you, everything is gonna work out. And by the way, what was the deal with that 1800 dollars on a mechanic in Vegas? Because this trip can't cost us money, you know. You know, babe? I'm finally having a little bit of success and you're making me feel bad about it. What are you talking about? Seriously, I'm just telling you what's going on here. That's all I'm doing. Is it like, I'm not cheering you on enough? It's not like, Ra Ra enough for you? Because I have news for you, I'm not actually one of your followers. - I'm your wife, it's different. - "You always do this." The minute I have something going on, you think I don't care about you anymore. But I do care, I care a lot. It's not... I don't think that, I just... Sam, I feel really disconnected from you right now. I... I cannot hear you. "I have to go, alright?" Okay. "Goodbye." Mom, it's very simple, okay? You just take the trash bag out, and you put another one in. I'm alone here! Your father keeps sending me to freaking Seven Eleven every 5 minutes. This trip is ridiculous! You belong here at home with me, working at Game Buddies. - Sam says I don't need Game Buddies. - "You know what is Sam though?" He's a middle aged loser. What's wrong with losers? I mean, you married a loser. Hey, where are the goddamn food stamps? What I am doing, is hanging up the phone. No, you are not. Do not hang up that phone Henry! - Henry! Henry! - Bye. - Was that Henry? - Yeah. - What's up? - How long have you been here? If it makes you feel any better, Amanda is not thrilled at me either. - Are you guys doing okay? - Oh, yes. This is great, this is exactly what she signed up for. Yeah. Well, I mean... You're a good husband, Sam. That's... Thank you. That's nice. - Thanks for saying that. - Yeah. Why are things suck so much? I don't know. But hey, you know what? Where's the big fake smile? I got it. Hey Henry, How's it going? I'm great! Yeah. My mom and dad, they're pieces of shit who don't care about me. And the girl I like? She doesn't respond to my texts because she realized what a loser I am. I'm in a jizz covered hotel room with a teenager who went to prom last year. Oh, I didn't go to prom. - I didn't go. Yeah. - Oh man. - The hits keep coming for you. - Yeah, I know. Well, I went but they kicked me out. - Cuz you were bringing everybody down? - Yeah, cuz I didn't go with anybody. Good for you. Good for you for going. Defiantly would have stayed home and Netflixed or something. Yeah. I don't think they had Netflix back in the 20's. Well, which bed would you like sir? There's only one bed, Sam. Are you okay with this? I hope this is not weird on the same bed, you know. Honestly, I didn't think it was weird until you said anything. But right now, I kinda think it might be weird. - Shouldn't have called attention to it. - Shouldn't have called any attention. You're absolutely right. You know, I got the Apnea. I don't want to scare you. I can wake up in the middle of the night choking and thinking I'm dying. Shit, it's Bobby. - Bobby? Hey! - Yeah, I don't want to talk... Bobby, yo yo! It's the Sam man. Sammy! Where is boy wonder? Put him on. Hey Bobby, I just wanted to know if there are any more brand deals - in the pipeline. - Not gonna happen, bud. - So no more ads? - "Look." I'll put this nicely. You're old. You're not like 30 old, "you're like 40 old." Which in App years is 60. You're like 80, Sam. You know when Madonna posts an Instagram photo and everyone is like... Oh god! No! Why? That's you. Get a million dude, then we can talk. I can't get a million in two weeks. No one said anything about it being two weeks. Stay on the road for a couple more years, dude. "Your kids don't need you. They got Ipads, right? - Where is the virgin? - I'm right here you piece of shit. - I hope you die. - Henry! Got you a gig at Teen Con. Six K. All you got to do is say hi to a bunch of teens covered in proactive. Hey, that's a lot of money, Henry. I'm not going to some stupid heart throb convention. Hey, give me this. Give me this. Hey Bobby! I'm not going to your stupid corporate tiger bead bullshit convention, okay? So you can take that offer of yours, and you can shove it up your fat... "Hey guys, I'm headed to Teen Con in Charlotte" "and I hope to see you there." "Hey guys, I'm headed to Teen Con in Charlotte" "and I hope to see you there." Alright, I'll go. Hey Bobby, so looks like Batman and Robin are in. Hello? "So Henry and I headed to Teen Con." "The biggest social media convention on the planet." "Basically an excuse for teens to pay a lot of money" "to take pictures with other teens who don't really do anything." "And to take pictures with dogs who wear glasses." Oh my god! I'm so exited. Oh my god!. Yeah! Okay, okay. Stop. You guys realize that no one is gonna respect you if you keep doing that, - Right? - Can we still have a selfie? - No. - I told you he was gonna be a dick. - What are you doing? - I don't like these things, okay? - These are your fans. - Don't They pay to see you, why are you being mean to them? - I feel like a monkey right now. - Why? Because of this! This is what's feeding me. Yo, yo, yo! It's Taylor and Hunter, and we hunting for some pussy. - Shit. - Who are they? - Taylor Wilson and Taylor Mackee. - What do they do? They're just two kids who take their shirts off and... Fuck the ground. Let's go make a video. - We're not doing that, okay? - Come on, you heard what Bobby said. I got to get to a million. Sam, don't.... Don't leave me here by myself. Oh fuck! One of them go loose. One of them got loose. Guess who? - Scarlette? - Yes, hi. - Hi. - My god. No idea you were such a stud.

I should have done that collab with you. You know, we should've done some Reloads in Vegas and shit. But I was kinda thinking: Man, this dude is dog shit, and his hair is stupid as fuck. So maybe we do that collab, maybe. But yo! Your man will figure it out. I saved your friend, by the way. I'm fucked up right now, I'm high as fuck. - I saved him though. - You were right about those kids. They took... kicked me. - I lost 20,000 followers. - Jesus. - That's a lot. - Of course it is. Sam?

Are you gonna come on vacation with us next week? "I don't think so bud. Um..." I got to stay on the trip a couple more weeks. What? What do you mean no? What do you mean a few more weeks? No, what? You're like away from my parents in like a two days. Well, I'm in... I'm in Charlotte. - And I still have to go to New York. - "Wait, what?" You're in North Carolina? No! You're supposed to be on your way home already. I have a new friend who is helping me. Swag, Swag, Swag, Swag. Yeah, Swag. We've seen, He is horrible. Look, I'm just trying to make money here. I'm doing this for us. "It doesn't feel like you're doing this for us." Feels like you're doing this for you. Okay... Look, I got to go, alright? I'll call you soon. Fine, go. Do whatever you want to do.. Cuz that's obviously what you are going to do anyway. Pacific rim job? I didn't order that. Schindler's fist? Is that a movie? - Sam. - Hey, what's up? Scarlette is gonna ride with us, so... - Come on, dude. Really? - What? Ridiculous. She is using you. - How do I know you are not using her? - Listen, if I was gonna use somebody I'd use someone who's a lot more low maintenance. That's not... That's a low blow. I just wanted to say that I think we got off on the wrong foot, and I'm sorry. Well, little work of advice Scarlette. When you come in to apologies to someone, Usually say the word, sorry. Well, I thought I just said that. Well, I didn't hear it. I got a lot going on. Like people buying porn on my account. Wait up guys. Hashtag Swag coming through with the bags. That's what's up. Hashtag, take my bags. Hashtag, check my abs. Yo, Imma roll with you. - I thought you were taking the bus. - Oh, man. The bus is whack, dude. Nobody recognized me, you believe that shit? - Nobody knew who you were, really? - Hell no, man. You look like R Kelly got a part in Star Wars. R Kelly pisses on girls, dude. That's dope. Is it? Okay, what're we doing? Hey, check it. I got a quick collab for us. Every once in a while, I like to give back, you know? Do some collabs with the handy crippled. You know what I'm saying. - Handy cripple? - I though that was the PC term. - No, it's not. You got it wrong. - No. Oh my god! I missed this shit. What is this? Welcome to my dojo. Did we get that? Was that good? - Do we need to do that again? - Dude, no bitch. That shit was dope. So you brought me some fresh meat, huh? So which one of you two am I gonna be fighting? I'm not fighting a guy in a wheelchair. That's it, I am weak? Or maybe I'm not at your level. Is that right? How about you fresh beat bam? I don't know if I'm allowed to be angry at you. So I'm gonna leave. And so are you. Sam, we're leaving. Come on. - He's coming back. He's desperate. - You think so? He needs followers. He's probably gonna suck dick for followers. - Really? - Hey. Hey man, look. I was supposed to be home yesterday. And I'm nowhere near my goal. I can't go home with faliure. Sam, you're better than this. Yeah, Sam. This will be the most degrading thing you do in your life. And I can see in your eyes, you've done some degrading things. And this will top all of those. So... Alright. Go to the car, I'll handle it. - I'll tell him. - Alright. Okay, hey! What's up? Let's do it. But I'm warning you. - Imma teach you just like... - Take that old man. Oh shit! Wait till I say go. Did you get this shit, man? Hey, hey. I need Wheelchair Tommy to take down that video. What are you talking about? That shit is number one. - We're not taking it down. - It's not right. I don't want it up. Dude, you know what we got to do though. Got to get rid of Henry, man. I'm not gonna ditch Henry. What Are you talking about? Dude, he's like the Gerald Folgol of fucking Reload. Hey! Where are you going? I'm gonna stay at Scarlette's, okay? - I'll find my way to California. - No, no. We still have time, come on. Sam. I wanted nothing to do with this trip. I didn't want to come. You made me come here. Okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I did all these videos. I just got caught up, okay? - In you. - No! In you. you think this is about you, because whenever I look at him, I just get reminded that this whole trip is because you wanted me for my followers. That's it. - That's not true. - That's exactly true. Not true. I did this so you can get some money and get out of your situation. That's why I did it. - This is about my situation? - Yeah. This has nothing to do with you? Yeah... Both. I was trying to help two people at once. I was trying to help you and me. I didn't ask for your help. And I... honestly don't do me any fucking favors. I don't want your favors. You know, Henry. You are 19, you have no idea what's good for you. Well, apparently what's good for me is good for you. And it's always how it's been. - That's not... - So. - My fucking nose hurts. - Let him go, man. Let him go film those stupid ass shoe videos, man. - What was that? What did you say? - I said: Go and film your stupid as shoe videos. You got a lot of fucking nerve, you know that? She might not have talent, but she got titties right. - Oh my god! - Oh shit! - Sam, sam. - Oh my god! It's fucking twice in one day. Leave me alone, stop following me. You can't do that to people. - You get that shit, man? - Yeah, I got it. - That dude wanted to fucking eat me. - This is really mean. Hey kids, I want to introduce you to my protégé. - Cracker Jack Jerry. - This is really wrong. - You can't sell this to kids. - What're you talking about, man? This is made for kids. - See that old lady over there, man? - Yeah. Let's go scare the shot out of her, man. - But she looks so nice. - Scare cam. Swag! It's just a scare cam... Yo, I think she died dude. It was his idea. Where are we? Are we still in Manhattan? This is more like.... Deep, deep Brooklyn. - Okay. - And this is me. Are you gonna invite me in, or... Okay. I mean, it photographs much bigger. So that's... It's a plus. Okay. Online Scarlette is not who I am. I'm just a normal girl trying to get some money to go to school. Okay. You know, sometime I really don't know what to say when I'm around you. But I'm gonna try and say something right now, okay? Scarlette. You're the only good thing in my life right now. I wake up every morning, and I just go... What's the point? I hate... My job. I hate my parents. I even kinda hate myself. But then I think about you, and that's enough to make it all just wash away. And the only reason that I made Reloads back in Orange county is because I knew you were watching them. And you were laughing. What you are doing now. That's the only... - That's the only thing I care about. - Yeah. Can you just... Can you stay with me please? - Yeah? - I can stay with you. Hans! I want that fish to look me in the eye, man. I want to have an out of body experience with that fish, dude. - Look at me. - Look at him. Yeah, do that. What are we doing here? Dude, you don't know Lawrence Fishburn? Not the dude from the Matrix with the acne scars. It's obvious that's... Yeah. Lawrence Fishburn is the hottest thing on the internet right now. - 4.2 million followers. - No! - In one month. - What? - Why? - What does it do? It doesn't do shit. It stares into your face with its big ass eyes. - Okay. - People feel like they relate to it. Look, man. I've been doing a lot of thinking, and... I just think we should really try to put some more thought - into what we are doing. - You know, that's funny cuz I've been thinking too. We puttin' way too much though into this shit. What we need to do, is just jack other people's jokes. I want to do something that has meaning. You know? And makes a statement and says something. Makes a statement? Bitch, who is you, Morgan Stanley? Homey, the internet is a cesspool that we create. I know exactly what I'm doing. Don't fuck with my shit. Hans! You and that fish need to get your shot together right now! Yes, sir. Right away, sir. Lawrence Fishburn. You're blowing this. Actually, look at me. I'm the star of this shit. My man! Princess Aubrey is having her sweet 16 party over at Sosh Con. She wants you to go and say some nice words. Pays 2K. The girl that's always offended by everything? She got that catch phrase, I'm offended? She did that Star Wars vlog about how Star Wars jokes - are offensive to Chewbacca. - Who cares, Sam? You and Swag are killing the game right now. And this could get you to a million. And then it's soup baby. Soup all around. I got a guy who makes a great corn chowder down in Albuquerque. You tell me, free shipping. Just got to that sweet 16. Wait a second. What are those? No, no, no. I think I stumbled upon something here. These are your paintings. Scarlette, you painted these? You painted these? Honestly, if you don't want to like, sell these I'll just buy them off you. - Okay, alright. I'll make you a deal. - Yeah. Okay, you buy the painting off of me. And then we can hang them anywhere we want in our house. I want you to stay. "Let's wish her the happiest 16th birthday," "Princess Aubrey!" Oh my god you guys, it's princess Aubrey. - I'm offended. - I'm offended. Well, thank you for coming, and thank you for tuning in. Now listen in. Old people need to just die already. We need thorough cleansing. The racism. The misogyny. I'm talking going door to door. Saying hello, and shooting anyone over 45 in the head, gestapo style. But today, I'm keeping around the one grandpa I do want to keep alive. He is here to talk about how amazing I am. Come on down, Sam Douglas. It smells like prunes, but it's okay. Our princess Aubrey's ideas are so innovative, and... Anti-gender normative. Yeah, you know. I... I'm sorry. You know what? I can't do this Aubrey. I know you payed me to come here, but... I don't like your videos, and I don't like you. Like, all you do is say you're offended. - I'm offended. - Yeah, I know. I though you would say that. You know, this whole thing... Everybody, all of us on this App... You know, it's wall to wall garbage. You steal what's real. We recycle the same jokes over and over again. And I'm guilty of it too. You know, the problem, the problem is not this. This is the most amazing thing that I've... That I have ever seen in my life. It allows us to... Connect, and... Create with the people we love. I'm just saying... With great privilege comes great responsibility. Are you doing a slow clap for yourself? I was just trying to get it started. Look man, I've been going through a lot, okay? - Oh, you've been going through a lot? - Yeah, I've been going back and forth cross country meeting up with a bunch of dipshits. - And it sucks. - Oh, I know it sucks. - Yeah. - That's my job, - dealing with those dipshits. - Well, I feel for you. They're awful. I'm tired of it man. I don't like what I became. Yeah, I don't like it either. Ypu're causing a lot of problems for me right now. Lot of problems. Yeah, all I did was tell the truth. - You told the truth? - Yeah. That's the problem. You know this generation, kids are 15. You got to be positive, colorful, bright. We lie to them till they're 22, and then Bam! Real world. Responsibilities. Shitty job at Starbucks. I'm dropping you. No Bobby. Come on man. I don't know what to tell you, Sam. I'm sorry. Okay. "Hey, it's Amanda. Leave a message." "Hey Amanda, it's me." "I'm really sorry, and I know this... "This is not like a normal life, but..." Can you please just call me back. I'm a faliure. I didn't follow what's in here. You know what I mean? You got to follow... Hang on a second. "Hey, how's vacation?" Is Amanda there? Cuz she is not picking up her phone. "She doesn't want to talk to you." I know. I know she doesn't want to talk to me, okay? "Can you please just put her on?" "You're embarrassing her." "You're embarrassing her in front of her family and the whole world." "I always knew this is who you were." "What does that supposed to mean?" "You're a selfish actor who wants to be famous." Sam. Sam, you in there? - Hey. - Hey. Sup Henry? It's funny. I just say that speech you gave. - It's fucking amazing. - Yeah. It's like you said exactly what I wanted to say to them. - Well, that was for you. - Thank you. You're welcome. I'm going back to California today, so. Okay. I'm sorry I've been a dick. I've been a dick this whole... This whole trip. I was a huge asshole. No I have. No, I was the dick. I left you, and I... Oh man, I collaborated with Swag. - Yeah. - And I did some... I did something real dumb last night, Henry. Okay. I deleted my account. What? You did what? - Why would you do that, Sam? - Because, I... It made me a horrible person, Henry. I mean, I just... I wanted to make it so badly, and I just got in my own way again. Fucked it up. Okay, you're not a horrible person. You made a mistake. People make mistakes, man. There got to be a way to get it back. There has to be a way. There's got to be a way to get it back, right? There is no way to get it back. You delete it, it's gone. You got to be kidding me. Wait a sec. I know what to do. I know how to get your account back. Put the mayonnaise on your ass. Now put the bread on your lips like a dick. Open your mouth wide. Wider. Hey, what's up man. Listen, we got to know where the creator is. I thought I told you not to bring this chump around no more. I deleted my account last night. What? You stupid... You just blew my mind. You're so stupid, man. I'm a DMT addicted alcoholic, and not even I would do that shit. We need the creators address, okay? Dude, I am not giving you the creators contact info, alright? That's why Swag number one. That's interesting, but here is the thing, Swag. You know that video that you showed us a little while back? Your sex tape, right? That what it was? Yeah, my sex tape. I jack off to that shit every day. What if your teenage followers saw this video, huh? What do you think they'll do? What do you think the brand would do if they saw that video? What you intimating? I'm intimating that you give us the address, or this video goes viral. And your career goes the way of Do-Do bird. - Way of Do-Do bird, huh? - Yeah. - Swoops away. - Swoops away. Like that silky swoop in your hair, huh? - Yeah. - I got it bitch! I got the phone! Now what you going to do? Swag, Swag, Swag it up. Swag it up. Swag, Swag, Swag it up. Swag it up. - Swag Jesus. - Now you've got the video. I gave you this phone, I thought I could trust you, man. And you tried to fucking blackmail my ass? Swag, I don't know if you know this but it's very easy for me to just copy it on my phone and upload it to the cloud already. Which is what I did. That must be a Hoo Boy! After all that. You live by the cloud, you die by the cloud, you know. Just the way it is. Alright, man. Fuck. You gon do me like this, huh? Alright, I see how it is, man. After all I've done for you. - I thought we were friends, man. - We are. - Are we really friends? - Yeah. I'm sorry. Shit just wasn't Swaging. He ain't gonna answer the door, man. He don't like people, dude. Oh man, this is really nice. - Toufer, open up. - Who's there? Who gave you this address? My friend deleted his account. We need your help getting it back. What do you think I back up everyone's shit? I'm not your mom. Once you delete an account, it's gone. Okay? Forever! Now get out, before it gets physical. Hey, I just wanted to say I know you are not too pleased with the direction your App... Get the fuck out of here! Wait a minute, Sam Douglas? - I'm sorry, I don't know who you are. - It's me, Toufer. Maybe this will jog your memory. Oh, hey man! So you're probably thinking: why would this guy take down his own App? That's worth millions of dollars. - Yeah, certainly crossed my mind. - Definitely. You see Reload was meant for art and finding love. But obviously, it became a wasteland. So, when I screwed over my investors by taking down the App for three days. I found myself surrounded by a S.W.A.T team in the botanicals section of a Sedona Whole Foods. And now I got to go back and work on my shitty new App which keeps track of how often you trim your pubic hair? - You made Carpet Calendar? - Yeah. Shit, I'm a big fan. Wait, why would you do that? That sounds like a... Going against everything you stand for. Everyone's got to buy Pinto beans, kid. - Sam? - Yeah? Still want your account back? I thought you said I can't get it back. No, I mean of course I can get it back, dude. I'm God. Phone. There you go. Put in your new password: You were never there for me dad. You were never there for me dad? - Okay, okay. - Capital Y. - O.U. - all caps? - No, Capital Y. - no, yeah. I got it. Dad. A of dad is an at symbol. - Okay. - You were never there for me dad. Yeah, we got it. You're just saying... Wait, that's a long password. It's the first thing that popped into my head. It's all there. It's all there. Thank you so much. - Thank you. - Sam, you saved my life. How about this, guys? How about I sponsor you on a tour on your way back. And we'll call it: - The friendship tour. - Is that name... - Like set in stone? - Sam, this will give you a boost. So you can make some money for your family. Yeah, that would be amazing. Yes, we would love to. Thank you. Sam, I need to tell you something. I... I... I'm staying with Scarlette in New York. - Yeah. - Yeah. I didn't tell you, because we've been... No, you should totally do that. I'm happy for you. Well, I'm sure you only... - They want the both of us, right? - Sam, You're my favorite. I mean, 40 years old out there just going for it? No matter what the haters say, Sam, do you want it? Do you want to be featured? Yeah, okay. I'll do it. - Jeez man. - I'm so thrilled. - Yeah. - Thank you, thank you so much. Look, I just want to say... I really like Scarlette. - Yeah, she is great. - She is smart. - Yeah, she's smart. - And, you know - Way out of my league. - Way out of your league. - Is she blind? - Deaf too I think. Thanks for... Thanks for bringing me out here. And just let me... You know, if I didn't... If it weren't for you, I would never... Met her, so I mean. You got to go. And I got to go. I got to go. - Got to go, yeah. - Alright. I'll text you and say goodbye for real. - Good luck with your life. - Okay. Cuz I'm not gonna see you. You will never call me and you won't text back, cuz you're a young millennial. So fuck off. Wait, wait, wait. I watched the end of Thelma and Louise the other night. Dude, they go over the cliff? But, I think they made it. - What? - I think they went over the cliff and there is another cliff right there. And bam, they are on the road again. They landed in the Grand Canyon. So like, they are both absolutely Unequivocally 100 percent Both Thelma and Louise They're both dead. No dude, they made it. "A lot of people like to complain about technology, but not me." "I'm so glad I got to be a part of it." It's me. Just please call me back. "But after a while, you realize how silly it all is." "That there is no age, or generations." "That we are all just here, trying to figure it out." "But this time, it's gonna be different." "This time, I was gonna be me." Hey, there he is! Sam! - Yeah! - Yes. - Oh boy! - Action. "Because life may be cruel," "But eventually, you get there." Oh God! Leave me alone. I think I like being on this side of the camera. "Some of us just take a bit longer than anyone else." "Sammy boy! They want you back, buddy. Pay's 3K." Yeah, you know what? I'm good on that one, Bobby. That's a pass. My man Dominic needs an operation. Check out his crowd funding campaign in the link below. Hello? Hi, I missed you. I missed you too. That's really dorky. - When did we turn into these people? - We're these people.

I know what will make you feel better, man - What's that? - Imma room service - some pussy up here. - No, not. not in here. Don't call it to this room. Ay yo, it's Swag. Can I get some pussy up here ASAP. Can I get some common sense too for my dumbass fucking dad roommate in this hotel, who's got kids and shit. Know what I'm saying? Know what I'm saying? Subtitled by: Captivate Arabia Amman - Jordan - Oh, that's awful. - Yeah. That tastes like Morgan Freeman's balls Tastes like Mad Max's dick. Yeah, tastes like Rosie O'Donnell's ass crack.
