[telephone ringing] Hello? Yes, it is. -Who? -[children clamoring] Certainly. Put her on. Aunt Tess? What? Wait one second. [children clamoring] Aunt Tess? I had to close the window. I couldn'’t hear a thing. How are you? Oh, no. Are you taking your medicine? Uh-huh. Uh-huh. You'’re coming when? Oh. No, no, it'’s not a problem. Of course, Charles would love to see you. It is so true. Aunt Tess-- You-- Aunt Tess, you'’re talking nonsense. Yes, I'’m sure. The 15th of this month? No, no, it'’s not a problem. A-All right, we'’ll see you then. I will. I will. Love you, too. Bye. -[Charles] Caroline! -In here! -Caroline, I got it. -Got what? -My vacation with full pay. -Oh, that'’s wonderful! Oh, I couldn'’t believe it. I got four weeks with pay. I mean, I expected two weeks, but four! Oh, you deserve it. You did a good job for them. -When does the vacation start? -In two weeks, on the 15th. -Fifteenth? -Yeah. Is something wrong? No, no, nothing'’s wrong. -Are you sure? -Of course. I'’m just surprised. Well, me too. Yeah. I wish the children were out of school. We could take a trip. It'’ll still be nice just to sit around this place and relax for a month in peace and quiet. Oh, it'’ll be wonderful. Hey, I wanna celebrate. I wanna take you to dinner tonight. -Oh, Charles, we don'’t-- -And don'’t tell me we can't afford it, '’cause we can. Uh, did you get my suit out of the cleaner'’s? -I was going to pick it up-- -Don'’t worry about it. I'’ll get it. You start gettin'’ ready. I want my best girl to look beautiful tonight. -[Caroline] Charles... -Yeah, darlin'’? [sighs] I love you. Oh, I love you, too. I'’ll be right back. [door opens, closes] [chattering] Oh, here we are. -Oh, it looks good. -Mm-hmm. Ah. Thank you very much. I can'’t believe you ordered that appetizer. Why not? You have to try new things. [scoffs] But snails? Yeah, sounds a little bit better when they call them escargots. [chuckles] Well, here it goes. Out of the yard and into my mouth. -Hmph. -Well? Mm, it'’s all right. I don'’t know what all the fuss is about, though. It kinda tastes like a, um, a rubber ball with garlic on it. -Sounds wonderful. -How'’s yours? It'’s fine. Somethin'’ botherin' you tonight? I'’m fine. And that is the third time you'’ve asked me. Well, because after I'’ve lived with you all these years, I know when something'’s bothering you. Well, come on, what is it? Aunt Tess is coming for a visit. That'’s wonderful. When is she coming? On the 15th. Of this month? Caroline, how could you do this? -I mean, how could you do it? -Charles, please. She'’s an old woman. I couldn'’t say no. What do you mean you couldn'’t say no? I--I have my first vacation in two years, and I have to spend it with your Aunt Tess? I can'’t stand your Aunt Tess. Charles, please, people are staring. Well, let '’em stare, they don'’t know what your Aunt Tess is like. You know, it'’s gonna be just like it was the last time. She'’s gonna take over, you know, rearrange the furniture, go in the kitchen and-- and then cook that, tha-- that he-- health food stuff she makes. Charles, I won'’t let her in the kitchen. You can'’t keep her out of the kitchen, you know it. Remember the last time, she-- she cooked stuff that tasted like weeds and shrubbery. Do you mind? We'’re trying to enjoy our supper. Well, do you mind? I'’m trying to have an argument with my wife. Charles... How would you like to step outside? Yeah, that'’s fine with me. -Charles-- -Don'’t worry. This is just gonna take a minute. [chattering] [door thuds] -Here. -Oh, thanks. Charles, I wish you'’d wait until tomorrow to call Aunt Tess, when you'’re in a better mood. I'’m in a perfectly fine mood. It'’s ringing. [Caroline] Charles, it'’s late. She'’s probably asleep. [chuckles] What, your Aunt Tess? Asleep? She never sleeps. If she slept, she'’d have to stop talking. Hello? Oh. Aunt Tess? Yeah. Yeah, this is Charles. Charles Ingalls. Caroline'’s husband. Yeah, yeah, uh, yeah, well, here'’s-- here'’s why I called. I-- I-- No, I-- I, I had no idea it was that bad. Uh-- Uh, Aunt-- Aunt Tess, you'’re not gonna die. I-- Yeah, but-- You-- Uh-- Yeah, I-- I can'’t wait. Bye. [sighs] I thought you were going to tell her not to come. You can'’t tell somebody something if they don'’t stop talkin'’ long enough for you to tell them what you wanna tell them. I'’ll call her back. No. No. I can'’t tell her not to come. She'’s talkin' about dying, it'’s her last chance to see us. She doesn'’t have anybody else. It'’s silly to waste this. I'’m starvin'. I'’ll put it in a pan for you. [chuckles] Thanks. You know, it just makes me so mad when somebody makes you feel so bad you can'’t tell 'em how you really feel about them. I wish she could'’ve heard her on the phone. [chuckles] -What'’s so funny? -Mm. I was just thinking about what you said tonight before you went outside. Well, what'’d I say? "Caroline, this'’ll only take a minute." Oh. Well, I was right, wasn'’t I? [both laughing] It'’s amazing how short he looked when he was sittin'’ down. [laughing] Oh, it won'’t be so bad, really. The children love Aunt Tess, and she is very good with them. It'’ll give us more time to spend alone together. Oh, it'’s true, I suppose. They had a wonderful time at her place last summer. Oh, I know that. It'’s just that... It'’s just what? -Caroline. Caroline, that'’s it. -What'’s it? Well, we-- we can'’t take the children anywhere because they'’ve got school. They had a wonderful time last summer with Aunt Tess. She took good care of them, didn'’t she? Of course she did. Well, let'’s let her take care of them again. -What? -You just think about it? You and I alone for a whole month, I mean, we haven'’t had that in, in, what, 20 years? Oh, Charles... No. We couldn'’t! What do you mean we couldn'’t? Why not? You can'’t think of a good reason, can you? -Well, no. -All right then. All we have to decide now is where we'’re gonna go. Oh, Charles, there'’s only one place in the world I'’d wanna go. Is it settled then? Oh, yes! Yes! Oh... Hey, Jeb, a bunch of us are goin'’ swimmin' at the quarry. You wanna come? Oh, I'’d like to, but I gotta help my brother with the rabbits. Oh, come on, we got a new swing rope up. -It'’s really good. -I don'’t know. Ah, let Jason take care of it today. You'’re bigger than him, what'’s he gonna do? All right, I guess it couldn'’t hurt this once. You go on, I'’ll tell him and catch up. Right. Jason, I got somethin'’ I gotta do. Do you mind cleanin'’ the cages without me? Yeah, I mind. This rabbit business was your idea to begin with. Well, come Easter you'’re gettin' half the money. -Aren'’t you? -Yeah. Well, then, just do me this one favor. I wouldn'’t ask you if it wasn'’t important. Well, where are you goin'’? Jason, it'’s so important, I can'’t even tell you. [sighs] All right, but just this once. -Thanks. -[Arnie] Come on, Jeb. You'’re goin' swimmin'’ or not? -Comin'’! -Swimmin'’? Jeb! That'’s not fair! You said it was important! Jeb! Jeb! I hope you get water in your ears. I hope you get sick and throw up. Jason! Jason, could you do me a favor? This letter came in on the late stage for Laura. Could you drop it by her place for me? It'’s from her pa. Oh, sure. It'’s on my way. Thank you, Jason. And you have a nice day. Yeah, it'’s too late to have a nice day. [sighs] ♪ When that I was and a tiny little lad... ♪ -Hi, Mr. Montague. -Good day, Jason! -Hi, Ms. Wilder. -Hi, Jason. I got a letter for you. Ms. Foster gave it to me. Oh, thank you. It'’s from my father. You'’re still buying a rabbit from me, aren'’t you? Of course I am, but don'’t you say anything to Jenny. I want it to be a surprise for her on Easter. I won'’t. My lips are like the envelope, sealed. -Thanks. -See ya. See ya. Almanzo! -Almanzo! -[Almanzo] What is it? -[Laura] They'’re coming! -[Almanzo] Who'’s coming? [Laura] Ma and Pa. They'’re coming for a visit! [Almanzo] Oh, Beth. Good news. -Come on. -All right. [laughs] My brother had somethin'’ more important to do. He went swimmin'’. Uh, you guys sure go a lot. Ah! There you go, Rabbie, all clean. I'’m gonna get you some water. There you go. Four more weeks till Easter, then I won'’t have to take care of you guys anymore and I'’ll have enough money to buy whatever I want. And I'’ll have my barn back. Oh, hi, Pa. Jason, where'’s your brother? Swimmin'’. I thought you two shared all the chores in this business venture of yours. Yeah, so did I. Well, you shouldn'’t let him get away with it. I can'’t do nothin'. He'’s bigger than me. I wish you guys had me first. Just poor planning on our part, I guess. -You want me to talk to him? -Heck, no. Then he'’d just get mad and do somethin'’ to me. Oh, come on now, your brother'’s not so bad to you. How would you know? -[John] Because you would tell me. -The heck I would. When older brothers do somethin'’ bad to you, the first thing they tell you is they'’ll do somethin' worse if you tell. Well, I'’ll put a stop to that. Well, that'’s all right. I'’ll handle it. -You'’re sure? -[Jason] Yes, sir. All right. Well, I gotta get back to work. -[Jason] Pa? -Yeah? -There is somethin'’ you can do. -You name it. Well, I'’d sure like it if you and Ma could make a younger child. Then it wouldn'’t be so bad if I had someone to pick on. Well, son, I'’m gonna have to talk to your ma about that. -Ah, thanks, Pa. -You'’re very welcome. [chuckles] You hear that, Herbie? Ma and Pa might make a younger child. So then I can do what Jeb does to me. You know, hard pinchin'’ and pickin'’ my nose and make him eat it. Oh, yeah, lots of fun. [yawns] -Didn'’t you sleep at all? -Hm... I tried to, but I couldn'’t. [sighs] Just too excited, I guess. A little anxious to see Rose, huh, Grandma? [chuckles] Yes, I am, Grandpa. -How about some breakfast? -Hm... I'’m not hungry, but some coffee sounds good. All right. I'’ll find the butcher boy. Are you sure you don'’t want something else? An apple if they look nice. One apple and a cup of coffee comin'’ up. The Sioux reservations were cut in half in '’58. Now, most of that land went to the trading-post owners. Of course, they couldn'’t do anything with it until Sibley defeated Little Crow in '’62. At that point the land was safe, but it was of very little value. Now all of that changed. Iron ore changed all of that. As you know, the Vermilion Range has been highly successful. But there'’s been an even bigger discovery at Mesabi. And that, gentlemen, is why we'’re here. That discovery has made all the land around Mesabi very, very valuable. Oh, excuse me. Yes, can I help you? Uh, yeah, I-- I was just lookin'’ for the butcher boy. I'’m sorry, I didn't know this was a private car. Oh, well, he must be up front. Thank you very much. Again, I'’m-- I'm sorry. Well, now that we'’ve found the butcher boy, where were we? Ah, yes, the new discovery at Mesabi has made all of this land very valuable. Naturally, Lassiter and Company saw it coming. We'’ve made deals with most of the trading-post owners. Uh, let me show you on this map. Uh, Drew. We now own all of the shaded areas. That'’s a lot of property. Yes, and we got it for a song. Some of these shaded areas have towns in them. That'’s right, Drew. And I want you men to check them all out. The towns we want to own, we'’ll own. Drew, I want you to start right there... Walnut Grove. Oh, Charles, look, there'’s that old oak tree you fell out of. -Remember? -[Charles] How can I forget? Climbing up after that silly kite. That was our first year here. Our first year. So many memories. Hey, come on, don'’t start cryin' yet. I won'’t. I take it you two used to live around here. [Charles] Yeah. Yeah, my wife hasn'’t been back for about three years. We'’re going to visit our daughter and our granddaughter. -Where are you headed? -Walnut Grove. [Charles] Oh, really? Is this your first time? -Yes. -You'’re gonna like it. It'’s a nice town, nice people. I can'’t wait. Charles, what time do you have? Yes, let'’s see. A little after 1:00. We'’re going to be early. At least an hour. Maybe I could get the driver to stop at their place. I bet they haven'’t left for town. -Oh, Charles, let'’s try. -And surprise them. -All right. Hey, driver! Driver! -Yeah? [Charles] Wonder if you could do me a favor. My-- my daughter'’s place is about two miles up the road. If you could drop us off there, it'’d save a trip into town. It'’s the first road on the right. You mean the Wilder place? -[Charles] That'’s right. -Sure, I'’ll be glad to. I appreciate it. -Hey, we'’re all set. -Oh, Charles. [Caroline] Only two more miles! Whoa! Ah. There you go, darlin'’. Oh. [chuckles] Here'’s your bag, mister. Oh, thank you, driver. -Nice travelin'’ with you. -Well, same here. -Hope you enjoy our town. -So do I. Well, we'’ll see you around, I'’m sure. [driver grunts] Oh, Charles... The house. It'’s so big. I told you. I know, but... Oh, I never dreamed it was so... It looks like a mansion. Yeah, it'’s a might bigger than the little house, I guess. Come on. [Caroline] Almanzo! Oh! Caroline! [laughing] You look wonderful! Well, so do you. What a surprise! We weren'’t expecting you this early. Uh, it was kind of a miracle, first time in history the stage was early. -How you doin'’? -Well, just fine, sir. Where'’s Laura? Well, she'’s still upstairs gettin'’ ready. She didn'’t sleep all night. Uh, that makes two of '’em. Well, go on, go on, go ahead. [chuckling] My hat. Just a few more minutes and I'’ll be ready. My hat. You'’re gonna see your grandma today. That'’s why we're all dressed up in our Sunday best. We have to look special for the most special grandma in the world. Oh, Rose, you'’re gonna love her. She'’s the most... -Ma... -Oh! My baby... Oh... I'’ve missed you so. Me, too. [Caroline] Rose. Oh... Oh! It'’s so good to be home. [laughing] Hyah! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! -Here'’s your bag, mister. -Thank you, sir. [driver grunts] Anybody here? [Nels] I'’ll be right with you. Yes, I do understand that, doctor, yeah-- [sighs] But the fact is-- -Excuse me. -Uh, uh, just a moment. Yes? I just wanted to check. Do you have any available rooms? Yes, we do. Uh, I'’ll be, uh, be just a moment, please. Oh, there'’s no hurry, I just wanted to make sure you had a room. Right. I'’m sorry, doctor. Uh, what I was saying is that... [sighs] ...it'’s been over six months since Harriet went into the clinic, and it seems to me that we don'’t-- we don'’t know anything more about her problem now than we did then. Yes, I, I-- I-- Yes, I understand that, doctor. Right. Yeah. All right. Will you please tell my wife that I'’ll-- I'’ll call her tonight? Yes, I will. Thank you. Goodbye. [sighs] -Sorry to keep you waiting. -That'’s perfectly all right. I was just looking at the menu. How'’s the food? Best restaurant in Walnut Grove. Of course, it'’s the only one. -It'’s good food, though. -And the beds are firm, I hope? Well, see for yourself, Mr.. uh... -Coleson. Drew Coleson. -Nels Oleson. I'’ll get the key. My wife and I own this place. She'’s been ill, that'’s why I was on the phone just now. She'’s in the hospital in Minneapolis. I'’m sorry. Yeah, we really miss her around here. This is my first trip to your town. -It'’s a nice place. -How'’s business? Very good, especially since they started mining over at Mesabi. Oh, I'’m glad to hear that. You, uh, thinking of doing some business here? Yes, as a matter of fact, I am. What business are you in? You might say just about everything. [violin music] [music continues] Thank you, thank you. Pa, I missed hearing you play. Well, I'’m glad I thought to bring my fiddle along. I wish I could play like that. Don'’t you, Mr. Montague? I did play like that once. -Really? -Yes, when I was a small child. Really? Perhaps you'’d like to honor us with a little tune. Ooh, no, no, no, really. It'’s been years. -Well, I didn'’t think so. -[Montague] But if you insist... [playing "Flight of the Bumblebee"] [music continues] Oh, dear, I was quite rusty, wasn'’t I? N-- no. I-- I didn'’t think you were rusty at all. I-- I can'’t believe you haven'’t played in years. Yes. [clears throat] But the violin is a bit easier for me to pick up as opposed to, say, the, uh, French horn. A-- are you telling me you play the French horn, too? I play all the instruments, including such ancient ones as the sitar and the lyre. [chuckles] Well, that'’s, that's amazing! Isn'’t it? It certainly came in handy when I was conducting the London Philharmonic. Oh-ho! Uh, well, [clears throat] Mr. Edwards, perhaps you and I should adjourn for a game of checkers and allow our hosts some time with their family. [chuckles] Yeah, Mr. Montague is teachin'’ me how to lose gracefully. I'’ll see you in the mornin'. Sure was a dumb song you were playin'’. -Really? -Yeah, sure was. -Nobody can dance a lick to it. -Mm... I told you he could do everything. Well, now I believe you. -I better get to the dishes. -I'’ll help you. Nope. When I come to your place, I'’m not gonna help you. [knocking on door] I'’ll get it. John, come on in. I'’m not disturbing anything, am I? No, not at all. Pa'’s here. -Charles, good to see you. -[Charles] Hey, John. Oh, it'’s good to see you. How you'’ve been? You remember my wife, Caroline, don'’t you? Yes. Ma'’am, it'’s been a while. Yes, it has. Well, I won'’t take up any of your visiting time. I-- I just dropped by to see if Isaiah could watch the place for a week. I'’ve got a shipment to take up to Mesabi, and Sarah'’s gonna go along and do a story on the new field. I'’m sure he'd be glad to. I'’ll go up and get him. Almanzo, wait a minute. Caroline, what do you say we watch the house for the week? -Us? -Well, sure. Don'’t you think it'’d be kind of fun livin' in the old place again? Charles, I'’m not gonna take the boys, so I'’m not sure it'’s gonna be as quiet as you might like. Oh, don'’t worry about that, they'’re full grown. They'’d be no trouble. Come on, it'’d be like old times. For the week, huh? What do you say? Well... I'’d love to. [chuckles] [Nancy] Father! Father! [Nels] Yes, Nancy. -[Nancy] Father! -[Nels] What? Jason'’s selling Easter bunnies, and I want one. They'’re 25 cents. Well, you can'’t have one. Why not? You know perfectly well why not. You got a bunny last year, and what happened to it? I don'’t remember. Well, let me refresh your memory. You played with it for two days, and then you forget about it. You didn'’t give it any water or food, and it died. Do you remember now? Vaguely. It was only a rabbit. It was a pet. And pets are a responsibility. I'’m sorry, Jason. I hope you understand. I sure do, sir. If I'’d known that, I wouldn'’t have offered to sell her one. You'’re just like him. You hate me, too. I hate to say this, Mr. Oleson, but your daughter is awful strange. I know, Jason, I know. See ya. [carriage rattling] -Mr. Oleson. [Nels] Good morning, Mr. Coleson. -How ya doin'’ today? -Oh, I'’m fine, thank you. Say, I wondered if I might, uh, use your telephone. Certainly. I'’ll get the operator for you. I'’m familiar with switchboards. I can get the number. The call is rather private. Suit yourself. You know where it is. Yes, thank you. [telephone rings] Hello? Yes, he is. Who? Just a minute. It'’s for you, a Drew Coleson. I'’ll take it. Drew. No, no, no, no, fine. Go ahead. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. How many? Really. All right. Reserve me a room at the hotel for Saturday. They'’ll all be in church on Sunday. That'’s as good a time as any to tell them. Right. Good news? Excellent news. Mr. Ingalls? -Mr. Ingalls? -[Charles] Huh? Charles, what is it? Nothing. I'’m sorry, Caroline. -Oh. -Jeb, what is it? Jason'’s not in his bed. Well, he'’s probably in the outhouse. He'’s been gone too long for that. I'’m gettin' worried. All right. I'’ll go look for him. You go on back to bed. [sighs] -Romantic, isn'’t it? -Mm. Be right back. [Jason] So you don'’t have to worry. Nancy won'’t be gettin' one of you. And neither will anybody else who doesn'’t promise to take good care of you. I know you'’re gonna miss me, and I'’ll miss you, too. But you'’ve got to understand. I need a way to make some money to buy stuff for my ma and pa, so they'’ll see that I'’m grown up. Jason, you'’re not gonna grow up at all if you don'’t get some sleep. What are you doin'’ here, Mr. Ingalls? Your brother woke me up. He was worried about you. He wasn'’t worried. He just wanted to get me in trouble. Oh, come on now, Jason, you don'’t mean that. I sure do. Don'’t take this wrong, Mr. Ingalls, but I know my brother better than you do. [chuckles] Well, I'’m sure you do, Jason, but I still think he was worried about you. [scoffs] I guess you'’ve never had an older brother. Oh, no, hold on. That'’s where you're wrong. I did, too. And he treated you nice? You know, sometimes. But most of the time he told me what to do '’cause I was too little to do anything about it. You see, older brothers are all alike. A bunch of bullies. Well, you know, I think sometimes they do it '’cause they're scared. Scared of what? Oh, scared that maybe their Ma and Pa might love their little brother more than they do them. That'’s dumb. Well, I don'’t think so. Now just think about it for a minute. I mean, here-- here was your brother. He had the whole family all to himself, and along came you. Now, you know how moms and pops are about little babies. I mean, they'’re pickin' '’em up all the time, tell '’em how cute they are, give '’em all that lovin'. That'’s enough to make a body get a little bit jealous, I think. I suppose. I never really thought of it that way. You really think he was worried about me? I'’m sure of it. -You know what I think? -Mm. I think you and I better get some sleep. -You'’re right. -Good boy. -Mr. Ingalls. -Mm-hmm? I'’m glad we had this talk. So am I, Jason. Now, come on, let'’s get to bed. [laughs] Jeb, Jeb, wake up. Jason, I'’m sleepin'. What do you want? I just wanna tell you not to be jealous. What are you talkin'’ about? You know, bein'’ jealous because Ma and Pa love me more than they do you. I'’m sure they don't, but thanks for worrying about me. [chuckles] I don'’t know what you'’re talkin' about. And I wasn'’t worried about you. Oh, come on, sure you were. Why else would you wake up Mr. Ingalls and have him come look for me? '’Cause I thought he'’d give it to you good, that'’s why. Now go to sleep. [sighs] Why do kids listen to grown-ups? [Alden] Arvin Tidwell will be celebrating his 95th birthday on Wednesday. Now, I think he'’d like it if some of his neighbors would stop by that day. Oh, Madge Thorn had a baby girl yesterday-- little Lisa Jean. Now, if any of you have any old baby clothes, I'’m sure Madge and her husband would appreciate your droppin'’ them by. And don'’t forget the picnic after church. And any of you here who want to go, but didn'’t bring any food, don'’t worry, there'’ll be plenty. Oh, before our closing prayer, I would like you to meet a stranger to our town, Mr. Lassiter, and he'’s asked if he could make an announcement that he says will be important to our town. Mr. Lassiter. Thank you, Reverend. And thank you for allowing me this moment. Well, I'’d like to introduce myself. My name is Nathan Lassiter, and I'’m President of Lassiter and Company. We'’re what you might call a land development company. One of my men, Drew Coleson, has been among you for some time now and has brought me back glowing reports about you all. Now, this may come as somewhat of a shock to you, but please hear me out. As you know, the land that this town was built upon was originally reservation land, but when the treaty with the Sioux collapsed, this land and, indeed, much of the land surrounding Hero Township was divided up. It was not homesteading land as many of you believed. [indistinct murmur] What I'’m saying is that it really boils down to the fact that Lassiter and Company owns the property upon which this town has been built. [indistinct murmur] [Isaiah] What is this, some kind of joke? No, sir, it is not. I have the deeds to back it up. Me and my family have been here for years. You'’re tellin' me after all that work, you own it? Please, sir, please, please listen to me. I understand your feelings, but we have no intention, of course, of forcing you all to move. We understand what you'’ve built here, how hard you'’ve worked for it. And there'’s no reason for you not to go right on building. Now, wait a minute, what is all this talk about? You want somethin'’, what is it? There'’s no reason for you not to go on working just as you'’ve always worked, sir. The only difference is that you'’ll be working for me as salaried employees. What, as salaried employees? What is he talking about? [Nels] Quiet! Quiet, please! Mr. Lassiter, as president of the Town Council, I think I speak for all our members when I say that we didn'’t build our lives here to have it run by some outsider. You may think we'’re just a bunch of hicks, but hicks stick together. We will fight this in the court until the bitter end! [chattering] As you wish, sir. I shall leave copies of the maps and the deeds for you. Please take them to the Council. You'’ll find that they'’re genuine. I shall return at the end of the week and make individual working arrangements with each and every one of you. Drew. [indistinct murmur] [instrumental music] [children clamoring] I just don'’t know. The deeds look legal, but I can'’t believe the law would uphold something like this. Well, there'’s only one answer. We need an attorney. Anyone have a suggestion? Well, there'’s Burton and Davis. That'’s the firm my son-in-law used to work for. They'’ve got a good reputation. -All in favor. -[All] Aye. All right, Burton and Davis it is. I'’ll leave for Sleepy Eye in the morning. Charles, you know them. Would you come with me? I'’d be glad to. What if these lawyers say he'’s right? Well, what are we gonna do then? Possession is 90% of the law. Now, if they want to get tough, we'’ll show 'em how tough we can get. Now, hold on. We just came from church, and you'’re all set to start fightin'’. What do you want us to do, Reverend? Just, uh, say, "Come on in and take everything we'’ve worked for?" Well, of course not. But what I do say is go through the proper channels. You know, there are laws in this country, laws to protect the people. And what if they don'’t? They will. Let'’s all bow our heads and silently pray for guidance and for forgiveness for our anger. [sighs] Well, gentlemen, I wish I had better news for you, but I'’m afraid Mr. Lassiter and Company has done quite a job in setting this up. You mean he has a legal right to this town? He can just come in and take it over? Legally, he has every right. Morally, he doesn'’t. However, the court will only concern itself, I'’m afraid, with the legal aspects of the case. I can'’t believe it. I can'’t believe the law would be that unfair. Neither could the Indians, who were originally given this land. Then there'’s nothing we can do? Not legally. I don'’t know what to tell you. I only wish I could'’ve been of more help. Walnut Grove is not going to give in without a fight, that I can tell you. Thank you for your time. Charles, I know there'’s gonna be trouble, and I know Lassiter. He can be rough, very rough. I know. I finished the dishes. Are you coming up? In a few minutes. Why are you cleaning that rifle? Beth, we'’ve been all through this. You'’ve been through it! I asked you not to buy it, and you went right ahead and did it anyway. Beth, I'’m not gonna let someone come in here and just take away my property. [sighs] He'’s not gonna take it away. He said you could work on it same as always. It'’s mine, it's not his. I'’m not gonna be a slave on my own property. And you'’d use that gun to stop him? -Answer me! -Yes! Yes, I would if I had to! [Jason] I don'’t know what we'’re gonna do. We haven'’t sold a single rabbit since this all started. [Jeb] Folks ain'’t thinkin' much about Easter right now. [Jason] Yeah. What do you think is gonna happen? -I don'’t know, but I'’m scared. -Yeah, me, too. Hey, look. That'’s Lassiter, all right. He said he'’d be back today. He'’s headin' for the Wilders. We gotta warn '’em in town. Come on. [Jeb] Reverend Aldin! -What'’s wrong? -Lassiter and his men. We saw '’em ridin' over to the Wilders. It'’s started. All right, spread the word in town. Tell '’em to go out to Almanzo'’s place. I'’ll head out there now. And remember, "no guns." [horse neighs] [gun cocks] Is that necessary? We'’ll find out. [horse snorts] -Mr. Almanzo Wilder? -That'’s me. A pleasure. Well, you have quite a place here. That'’s right. And I intend to keep it. Let'’s stop the threats, Mr. Wilder. I came here on business. Now, I'’ve calculated a salary-- I don'’t think you heard me. I said this is my place, and I want you off of my land. You are being rather foolish. Of course I am. I'’m nothin' but a dumb farmer. Now, get off my land! I'’m afraid you give Mr. Lassiter no choice. This is a court order for you to quit the premises in 48 hours. Or what? Or I'’m afraid you will be removed bodily. It'’s legal. Yes, sir, quite a place. Forty-eight hours, Mr. Wilder. [grunting] Hey, get him, get him off me! Get him off me, get him off me... Don'’t take my land! Just-- just hold him. Just hold him. [groaning] Leave him alone! Stay out of it! [groans] [bawling] [men grunting] [Montague] Let him go! [men grunting] [chattering] [Rose bawling] [gunshot] [Rose bawling] Get off this property now. I mean it. Let'’s go. We'’ll be back here on Friday. You tell them all that. I came here to be fair, but you wouldn'’t listen to me. Now you'’re gonna do as I say and get out. You tell them all that. [horses galloping] [groaning] Montague? [indistinct conversation] I'’ve heard these things so many times. He who lives by the sword will die by the sword. Well, somebody gotta have a sword, don'’t they? [indistinct conversation] -Doc, how is he? -A couple of broken ribs. He'’ll be all right. What'’s going on? They'’re making plans for Friday. A show of force when Lassiter comes into town. Guns? Yeah, I'’m afraid so. The reverend tried to talk them out of it, but it'’s no use. You can'’t bluff a man like Lassiter, you know that. You gotta try, doc. I'’m with you. I don'’t understand any of you. No piece of land is worth losing your life over. You'’re right. You don'’t understand. [sighs] Don'’t go to town Friday. I have to. Why? Because it'’s my fight, too. Walnut Grove is still our home. We watched our family grow up here. I just can'’t be turnin' my back on it now. You can'’t win. I know. But if folks don'’t stand up to people like Lassiter, it'’s just-- it'’s just like sayin' "Go ahead, take what you want." And sometimes you have to fight for what you believe is right. Our country was founded on that belief. You know what I'’m saying, don'’t you? Yes, I do. I do. [machine whirring] [whirring] [ticking] [Jason] Ms. Plum? Yes, Jason? I have to use the outhouse. I don'’t want anyone going outside. But, Ms. Plum, I have to. I can'’t wait! All right, but I want you to come right back inside. Yes, ma'’am. [Etta] Jason! Use the other door. Yes, ma'’am. Class, go on with your reading. [machine whirring] You'’re not welcome here, Lassiter. I want no trouble. I'’ve got legal papers for all of you here. I said you'’re not welcome here. That'’s strong talk considering the fact that you'’re standing in the middle of my street, in my town. I'’m surprised to see you involved in this, Reverend. I'’ve done my best to stop this, Mr. Lassiter, but I couldn'’t. Now, I ask you all to sit down peacefully and discuss this matter. There'’s nothing to discuss. This is my property. I want you off it. And how do you propose to get us off? Getting you off isn'’t my job. [horse neighing] Good morning, gentlemen. I'’m Colonel Forbes. The town have a spokesman or mayor? I'’m Nels Oleson, head of the Town Council. Mr. Oleson, I'’ve been sent here to ensure the peaceable takeover of this property. Colonel... we have spent our lives building this place up. We are not going to stand aside and let it be stolen from us. I understand how you feel, sir, and please believe me when I say that I don'’t like it any better than you do. But that doesn'’t alter the fact that I still have a job to do. You better understand we ain'’t gonna give up without a fight. Isaiah. Colonel, I'’m Reverend Aldin. There'’s a lot of anger here today. If we could just sit down and talk... Mr. Lassiter, lives could be lost today if you don'’t listen to reason. Law is reason, Reverend. Colonel, get on with it. I'’ve been instructed... to have all residents of Walnut Grove be removed from their business establishments by sundown today. By God, you'’ve got a fight on your hands. Column, dismount! Ready positions! Gentlemen, in the name of the United States Army, I demand you give up your weapons. You can see, I have a lot of young men in my command, and their lives are my responsibility. Now, don'’t force me to give an order that'’ll create bloodshed. Needless bloodshed. You would only delay the inevitable. He'’s right. Look, I know how you all feel, but he'’s right. We can'’t fire against the Army. It makes no sense to die for a lost cause. Sergeant, form a detail to collect the weapons. They'’ll be kept until you'’re ready to leave. We'’ve made no preparations to leave. We'’ve got to have some time. They'’re to be out of here today. Give us till Sunday. It'’s Easter. Let us worship together one more time before we have to say goodbye. Colonel, I want them out of here now! We'’ll give you till Sunday afternoon. Thank you. Please understand, I'’m only doin' as I'’m ordered. Mount up! Oh! Oh! Thank heaven you'’re all right. I saw Lassiter go by the house with soldiers. What happened? It'’s over. Everybody has to be out by Sunday afternoon. Oh, no. It'’s just so hard to believe. I know. I talked to Almanzo, he'’d like to go back with us until he can get another homestead together. The poor boy, he cried like a baby. [sighs] He isn'’t the first one to have to leave and start all over. They'’ll make it. We did. That'’s right, we did. I'’ve got some coffee on. That sounds good. We'’re gonna have a meeting after services tonight. The trouble'’s over though, isn'’t it? Oh, yeah, uh, it'’s just a gathering to see if anybody needs help moving. Lot to do in a short time. I'’ll go over and give Laura a hand. [carriage rattling] I hate to tell the Carters. They love it here. Sorry to be gone so long, Charles, but I got another shipment. I had to swing around through Dawson to pick it up. Dynamite for the iron mine. They'’re payin' double to haul it. Were the children good? Yeah, they were fine. Something'’s wrong, Charles. What is it? Are the children all right? Ah, your boys are all right. Look, why don'’t you come on in the house, and I'’ll tell you all about it? I'’m afraid he'll be here in about an hour to pick up the furniture. [plates shatter] [sobbing] I'’m sorry. I just have to let it out. I know. I know. I'’ve already had my turn. We'’ve been through worse, you know? -And we'’ve been just fine. -I know that. It'’s-- I don't know why... I'’m just so angry. Manly, I'’m really angry. I know how you and Pa feel about this land. It'’s ours and they'’re stealing it, and I'’m really angry! That Lassiter'’s gonna come in and use our house. Our house! I'’ve never been so angry in my whole life! Then let it out! Just let it out! [sobbing] [glass shattering] All right, then, the Turners will load Ms. Foster'’s things on their wagon. [Turner] I don'’t know if I have enough room for all her things. Well, there'’s plenty of room in my wagon if you need it. Thank you, Isaiah. I'’d like to take a moment to talk to you. Times like these test our faith. Why does God allow a man like Lassiter to exist? Why doesn'’t the Lord intercede on our behalf? Now, we'’re good Christians. Why are we the ones to suffer at the hands of a man like this? They'’re not easy questions to answer. But the fact is... evil does exist in this world, and it always will. But I believe... with God on our side... we will survive... and we'’ll prosper... for faith and love are the strongest weapons in the world. We must hold those weapons high in times like these just as we have in the past. We'’ve felt the power of love in this town many times. When adversity struck, we pulled together. We have felt the caring friends. We have felt something... that a man like Lassiter will never feel. And we thank God for that. Well, I'’m feeling something a little different, Reverend. And I'’ll tell you what I'’m feeling. Anger! Do you think I don'’t? Do you think that just because I am a minister, I don'’t feel those things? Of course, I do. But he owns the land. What good is it to worry about something that is past... when we have the future to look to? [Isaiah] No, Lassiter'’s got the future. He moves in here and runs the businesses that we'’ve sweated over for years. Well, why let him? There'’s something we can do. I got mad today, really mad. And you know what I did? I busted some windows. Yeah. It may sound silly, well, maybe it is. But they were our windows and he'’s not gonna get them. He owns the land. Well, let him have it. But he'’s gonna have an awful lot of fixin'’ up to do before he starts runnin'’ our boarding house. [John] Listen here. You wanna do more than bust a couple of windows? I got a wagon at my place loaded to the gills with dynamite for the mine. All right, by God. Lassiter wants to kill our town. The least we can do is bury it! Well, what do you say? [all] Yes! That'’s right. Sunday. Yes. Well, I think it would be wise for you to be there. Of course. Oh, good. Good. All right. We'’ll see you there then. Buh-bye. Mayor Stovale will be there. Good. That'’s all of them, then. I think it'’s smart for all of them to see what'’s happening in Walnut Grove. That'’ll make the takeover of their towns a whole lot easier. They'’ll find out for themselves. Either work for Lassiter and Company or they get out. I propose a toast. To the king of Hero Township. I like that, Drew. I like that a lot. -That'’s the last of 'em. -Thanks. I was so proud of you tonight. You should have been. I kind of reminded myself of you. Me? Yeah, you. Yeah, I remember when things got hard for us for a while... like, when we had to leave our home in Kansas... you never let it break you. [chuckles] You'’d sure get mad, but you'’d never give up. We had your pa there. Oh, I know. I also know he never could have done it without you. You are his strength. All my life I wanted to be like you. So you see, I'’m the one who should be proud... '’cause if I didn't have a ma like you... I wouldn'’t be me. You'’re right, you know? They couldn'’t have done it without us. [both laugh] [bell tolling] Jeb, Jason, get in the wagon. I'’ll never forget this little house. Nor will I. [creaking] We'’re all set here. I'’ll go see how father'’s doin'. Okay. Yes, right after church. We should be home by Thursday. I will. I will. We love you. [Caroline] I know. I'’ll tell him. Give Aunt Tess a hug for me. Me, too. Goodbye. Children all right? They'’re fine. They said to tell you how sorry they are... about the town. Well, we better go. Dear Lord... we bury a friend today. This town has been our friend. It'’s made us a family. It'’s kept us together. Wherever we go in this world... we will always remember Walnut Grove. It will always be home to us. [sobbing] [sniffles] [sniffles] [detonator creaks] [detonator creaks] [wind gusting] [detonator creaks] [detonator creaks] [tolling] [Lassiter] Stop the coach. What the hell? Get up there. Sergeant, keep the troops here. I promise you, you'’ll not get away with this! Get away with what? Colonel! [Lassiter] I want every person here arrested! On what charge? Charge? They'’ve destroyed my town! [Isaiah] Excuse me. Our town. Now, you might own all of this land, but what was on it is ours, to do with what we saw fit. [mayor 1] Is that right, Colonel? That'’s right. No law'’s been broken here. [mayor 1] Lassiter... I don'’t know how these other men feel, but as mayor of Hinton, I want you to know that this is what you'’re gonna get if you try to take over our town. And that goes for Tillman. [mayor 2] That goes for all of us! Thank God. Did you hear? Walnut Grove did not die in vain!
