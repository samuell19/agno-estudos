My sand brown belt. - With Lurk sir. - Off. - Sir. - Yes, you guessed it, I'm the under footman. And you can't get much lower than that. (laughs) did you know I have to do all the cobbling as well? It's not fair, because there's a load of cobblers up stairs and they're all a bit slack. Oh here it is. His masters voice. - His lordship wants his boots. Chip like. - And Lady Twithampton's feet are bare. - Captain Nigel wants his boots, quick for the use of and a belt, quick. - Alright, alright. There's your quick belt for Ni and there's his boots.

Well he's always after her, the butler Groping. What, that's not only his name, that's his hobby, groping. Look at this, come here. Ah, there's the fanny I worship from afar. She has a soft spot for me as well you know. Though she doesn't show it very often. - Ha, Fanny, here's me over 40's covered. (swallows) Now I'm ready for anything. - Here comes old Groping. Why Lord Twithanpton took him on I shall never know. They're a very particular family, the Twithamptons. Oh yes, oh yes, you have to be vetted you know. (girl screams) I must say they didn't do a good job on old Groping. - Mr. Groping what are you doing? - What never can be undone by the look of it. - Ah Fanny. - Oh unhand me Mr Groping. This instant. - Don't fight it Fanny, it's bigger than both of us. - Yes, that's why she's fighting it. (rips) - Oh, Mr Groping, you're not going to rape me, are you? - (mumbles) Heads or tails. - Tails. (laughs) - She's lost. And she's pleased. (laughs) (growls and giggles) what a strange thing to use braces for, that's stretching it a bit. (laughs) - You can't do this Mr Groping, what about his Lordship? - I don't fancy his Lordship. - Oh. - I must save her. For meself. I say Groping is that you in there, I have to inform you that her Ladyship is expecting. - Pardon? - To go for a drive after luncheon will you kindly tell the chauffer to get the motor car prepared? - [Groping] Yes sir. - Oh and by the way Groping, give that chap Lurk the rest of the day off. Splendid fellow that. - What were you doing down there? - Oh how can I answer that with this dreadful thing hanging over me. (grunts) Don't worry Fanny, I've fooled his fondling. - Yes, thanks, for nothing. - Hmm, nothing she calls it. Well she doesn't know any better poor soul. Still, I love her dearly even if she is only just a common little trollop. 'Course round here she's known as Fanny by gaslight, or my moonlight, or by sunlight, or by candlelight, I mean it's all the same to her. She always closes her eyes anyway. - Come here you. Ha ha, I'll teach you to interfere in me private life. - Oh Mr, your life is no concern of mine. Especially your private parts. - Uh? - Ah there you are Groping, I've been looking all over for you. - Yes milord. Your cravat, it's drooping a little. - That's no surprise is it, he is 75. - Ah thank you Groping. One must look smart in one's countryside apparel what? - Silly old fool, he's convinced there's gonna be a war. - Indeed milord. The hun is knocking at the gate again. - What rubbish, who would dare to start a war with us? - Morning governor. - [Lord] Ah Nigel. - Looks like the boom might go up at any moment.

My name is Colonel Von Gutz, German intelligence. - Colonel Von Gutz, Colonel Von Gutz. Sorry, force of habit. - We are facing a great crisis. We must consider it very carefully. Snuff, gentlemen? What do you say? (goat bleats) What was that? - Baaa, Herr Colonel. - Very funny Hamburger. Gentlemen, a master plan of our armies in the field has been stolen. (men gasp) There has been an enemy amongst us. We believe itself to be the work of British intelligence a certain Captain Nigel Phipps Fortescue. - [Men] Fortescue? - That's me. - Your pardon Herr Colonel, but where was the master plan at the time of the theft? - In your safe Captain. - No, that isn't possible. That safe is heavily guarded day and night. - Silence. Question is, how was the plan stolen? Well Captain, I'm waiting for your explanation. (sneezes) (men shout) - It's Fortescue!

Wait a minute. - [Colonel] You remember the search light, leave it on all the time I want to see every building lit up all the way. - Come in, shh, and wipe your feet. (bleats) - [Soldier] There's nothing in there sir. - [Colonel] Alright we search the left, heil, heil, heil, schnell, come on schnell. (speaks foreign language) over there, over there, move yourself, move yourself. - Lurk listen, this is it, now Von Gutz knows that I've got the German master plan. - Yes? - And he'll stop at nothing to prevent me from getting it to General Burke. - So? - Someone's got to volunteer. - Well there's only me and the goat. - It's got to be you. - Me? - Think of your army career. You'll go up higher. - Yes, angel first class. - No, no, no, I mean, they'll promote you. - Promote me? - Yes, you'll be an officer and a gentlemen. - An officer and a gentlemen, you're right that's my destiny, I'll do it. - Bravo Lurk. - You're welcome. - Now remember the password. - Yes. - Boiled beef and carrots. - Boiled beef and carrots. - Now we have them, there are only three shops in there. (bomb explodes) Man the guns, hurry, those are British shells. - What's that. It's not the kettle boiling. (shouts) - Lurk? Lurk? What can I do with the plan? Oh god, oh god, how can I smuggle it out? (bleats) Why not? I hope you don't mind Lurk. (groans) (bombs explode) - So naughty not now. - (speaks foreign language) (moans) - Hurry up you fools - There's only one shop left Herr Colonel. - Give me that thing. - Now to get rid of the plan. Oh my god where are my lucifers? - We know where you are so come out with your hands up, English swine. - [Vincento] You must save England. (rips) (bombs drop) - Save England. (shouts) - We've done it, we've done it, we're gonna be alright. (explodes) - I must save England. - Oh dear Mr Lurk, you've been blown up by a shell. - Have I? - Oh, and you've got two enormous swellings here. - Yes I must help them. - Have you any conception what will happen if we do not retrieve our master plan? - Yeah, Herr Colonel there is repercussions. - Serious. Serious. The entire German army's on the march, the master plan is in operation now, it cannot be stopped. - I shall stop the British from taking to their headquarters Herr General. - You shall. - I shall get into their hospital, Herr General. - Poor Captain Nigel's in a bad way, he's been knocked silly. - Typical of all the officers here. - Oh look is this absolutely necessary? - Absolutely, now stop your nonsense. - Oh dear, oh you might have taken your ring off. - It's a little gem. - Thank you. Oh, - Mr Lurk will you kindly look on me as a trained nurse. - Yes but I am not a trained invalid am I? Ack! - Turn over. - I thought you'd never ask, we almost reached the point of no return. - Over! What's this? - Well if you don't know dear, something basic was left out of your training. - No I mean this. - Well I mean that. - There's something written on it. - What is it, made in Hong Kong? - No, it says by order of the high command of the German army, this smart plan is restricted. - That's it. - Oh. - The master plan. That's what Nigel was doing behind my back, tattoo. What a low down trick. - It says top secret. - Yeah well it could have been better put, nevermind. - What are you going to do? - Do this is my chance, my big chance, my chance to save England. Now, where's the headquarter, I must get to headquarters. I'm behind with my mission, get the uniform will you. Now which is the way out? Oh, let's see what's through here. (shouts) Groping. I don't believe it. Where's my uniform. - Lurk! There's special uniforms where you're going. MP. - Sir. - You are going to the Glass House. - The Glass House, I'm not a tomato. I'm the savior of England. - Please don't take him with you Mr Groping. - Sergeant Major Groping to you. He's arrested for desertion. You're for the high jump. - What is going on here? - He's the one you want, he's a German spy. - I beg your pardon sir. Now that will add insulting an officer to your list of targets. - But officer? Her my Auntie Joyce. Meant to give the game away then. - Can I have a private word with you please doctor? - Yes. - Please don't let them take Private Lurk doctor. - Oh why? - He's got some battle information on him. - Has he. - Mmm, and he must get it to General Burke at headquarters. - Don't worry my dear, leave it to me. - Thank you doctor. - My pleasure. Sergeant Major you're to leave this man in my care. - Don't leave me with him. He's a spy. - How would you like a crack across the head with my Billy cock. - What are you an acrobat? - Help me get him to a private ward. - No. - With pleasure sir. - I need to interro- give him the help he needs. (laughs) Come on nurse, come with us. - Oh dear, gallant young soldier cut down in his prime. I haven't had it yet. - Oh hello boys. - Look meals on wheels. - Come along boys what about a couple of choruses for Cora? - Yes come on, let's raise a chorus for Cora. (cheers) * Up the front, up the front * The boys are going up the front * While others sit at home learning to knit * Little Tommy Atkins is doing his bit * Up the front, up the front * That's where the boys are going * When they get there, won't stand a chance * They'll give jerry a hell of a dance * For just three and four pence we're bound to advance * Up the front, up the front - Sing doctor. * Up the front, up the front * The boys are going up the front * So give them all a kiss something like this * So they - Thank you Resa, very nice. * Up the front, up the front * That's where the boys are going * They'll fight harder the tougher the need - Now I must get to headquarters. - I've got it. - Still, you're lucky all these soldiers around. - No, look. - You mean, get plastered? - Sir? - Farewell dear lady, you are truly an angel of mercy. - Oh it's the least a body can do for our gallant Tommys. - Where you taking this one? - He's going in the ambulance to headquarters. - Just a minute. Who've you got on there. - Just a poor young trooper, who's given his all for his country. - Poor, brave little chap. One kiss, one last kiss. - Oh god blimey, pickled onions. - Lurk? - Yes Mr Groping? (screams) (dramatic music) - After them. - Quick, army headquarters. Before I crack. - Right. (shouts) - Colonel Von Gutz, how would you describe your behavior? - Herr General. I have failed. - And you know the penalty for failure? - Yeah Herr General, I will be shot. - I am bound to offer you the usual alternative. - Oh thank you Herr General. - You know what to do. - You mean. (shoots) What did you see? - [Men] Nothing. - Neither did I. The time has now come for me to play my trump card. General Burke is moving his headquarters forward of Amentieres and the stupid British head of intelligence has become infatuated with a certain lady called Mata Hari? - Mata Hari? - She is our top spy. - You're not supposed to know that. General Burke is giving a party in his HQ tonight. As usual Mata Hari will be by his side. Gentlemen we are leaving at once for Armentieres. (party music) (chatter) - Here we are mate HQ. - HQ? Here? You've been driving me for 10 hours and we're back where we started from. - It's not my fault if they keep moving the HQ. - Well I wish they'd settle down somewhere, this is so confusing. Oh leader. - I'll have me coat too. - Alright, alright, thank you. - Toodle-oo. - Toddle-oo. There now, the thing is how to get into there somehow, meet General Burke, and give him the master plan, and thus save England. The thing is how? How to get in. Oh dear, oh dear. (horse neighs) - Just a moment sir. - Yes. - Can I see your invitation card sir? - My invitation card. - Ain't nobody can come in here without an special invitation card from Mata Hari sir. - Oh Mata, dear old Mata, one of my greatest friends. I knew him when we were at school. - Him? Mata Hari's a lovely woman. - I didn't tell you why he was expelled did I? - Just a minute sir. What's all this. - This is a fancy dress, it's fancy dress isn't it? - Fancy dress. - Yes, the Hunchback of Notre Dame surely. - It's that deserter. - Oh look a zeppelin. (men shouting) (waltz music) (applause) - [Announcer] General and Madame Du Bibier. - You mean to say you'd never met her? - I'm afraid General Burke alas, I've not had the pleasure. - Neither have I dammit. Still she's kindly consented to act as my hostess tonight, so perhaps one thing might lead to - The other? (laughs) - I hadn't thought of it, yes. Where is the lovely Mata eh? - I understand she's in her boudoir, finishing off some mail sir. - Oh, some male eh? Lucky devil. I wonder who he is huh? (soft music) - Ya, this information's going to be very interesting to the fatherland, very interesting. But not as interesting as my work tonight. Copy and seal it. - Yes madam. - Tonight I must steal back the German master plan. Mata, men I worship you. They tell you that your eyes are fabulously beautiful. That your mouth is warm and inviting. They tell you that your skin is heavenly, that your hair is spun gold, they tell you that your figure is desirable on sight. And why not? I even intoxicate myself. (chatter) - [Announcer] General and Lady Collins. - And where do you think you're taking that lot? - I must go in and exhibit my onions to madam. - She don't want no onions, buzz off. - But she always gives me the business. (men shout) (applause) (waltz music) (splashes) - Ah, trust me to get this room. (man hums "Allouette") - Not bad for a penny, now trousers. (sings "Allouette") - [Man] (shouts foreign language) - I know that I'm only a silly woman, but I heard that the Germans have lost their master plan. - Oh I know nothing about that my dear. - If it's true it must be in the hands of the most important man in the whole army. I wonder who that is. - Oh me of course, me. - But you just said that you don't know nothing about it. - I know all about it. - Why didn't they come to you, if you're such an important man? (chuckles) Are you sure you don't have it? - I'm afraid not my dear, but talking of having it I'd rather. - I'll see you later. - [Announcer] Sir Grungle Du Grut. (trumpets sound) - [Vincento] Save England. - I must, for King and Country. - Pardon? - Oh I'd love a glass of pardon, thank you garcon. - [Announcer] The minister of weapons. (tango music) - I did not think that a foolish English man has a master plan yet. - What? My God. - What is it Colonel? - You see that man who is lurking over there? - The one in the French uniform? - Yes, he's an imposter, he is British. He has the master plan, I want you to find out where he's hiding it. - Don't worry, a few drops of my truth serum and he's going to tell all. - Thank you Miss Mata Hari. - Au wederscheon lebschein. - Sir, steak and kidney pie. Hot eels and mash. Uh, uh. Sir sorry, boiled beef and carrots. - That's the stuff for your darby girl. - Here, Captain Phipps Fortescue he. - Shhh, not so loud, not so loud. - He sent me. - Good man, good, good, good, man. Now have you got it. - Yes I've got it. - Right well let me have it. - Could we go upstairs? - No, no, no, we can't go upstairs we cannot. - Private you see. - I can't no, we must have it now. Now look here. I'll covertly turn my back and then you can discreetly slip it into my hand. (scoffs) - You've got no hopes of that sir. - Look here, look here, look here. I want to see it and I want to see it now. That is an order. - Now? - Yes now. - (mumbles) now? - Yes indeed now. - Here. - This very moment here. - Alright, alright alright. - Come on, come on, come along, come along, hurry up. What the hell are you doing? Don't do that, don't do that. - You said now. - No, no, no, look. - You said now. - Yes of course I want to see it now. - No, no, no I don't want to see it here. Someone stop him. - You heard him, stop that man, and take those hats off. - [Men] Ja wohl. - Someone help me, help me someone, you maniac. This man's a maniac. (shouts) - (speaks foreign language) - Oh my god the place is crawling with them. Good god get them all out of here. We don't want any of your filthy French tricks here. - [Guard] And stay there English pig dog. - Well, what am I gonna do here? - [Mata] Come over here. - What a remarkable echo. Oh. It's hardly worthwhile putting this back on again. Hmm. - I've been waiting for you darling. - Have you. - [Mata] Mm-hmm. - No, I'll play hard to get. (sweeping music) - I've been watching you the whole evening. - Have you? - Every time I see you I get lumps in my throat. - I should swallow hard dear, I can see another couple on their way up. (laughs) Ah youth, drinkies? - Would you like to have a drink with me? - Yes, drinkies. - Yes. Wouldn't you like to kiss me? - Mm-hmm, fool, you mad fool, you're flirting with death, don't you realize I haven't seen a woman for nearly 20 minutes? - Oh. (laughs) (coughs) - So that's her game. (laughs) - To a just peace in our times. - To juicy peace anytime. (laughs) (mms and kisses) One for the road. - Okay. (kisses and laughs) - Yes but first another kiss. (laughs) - Oh darling please. - Of course. Surely she won't pull that old gag. - Of course I will. - In that case so will I. Oh, oh I'm so sorry. (laughs) oh do it again. Oh, you're better than me. Ah, of course you've had more practice. (laughs) ah. (kisses) - Oh stop it your kisses are like fire. - Let's put another log on and stock up. More kisses. - More kisses? - Why not, you're as deserving as any woman. (laughs) (kisses) Drinkies? (laughs) - Drinkies. (laughs) - Cheers. - Cheers. (gulps) - Did you get the drug? - Yes. - Thank god for that. What sort of drug was it? - Truth drug. - Truth drug. - It's against my religion, I will have to tell the truth for once in my life. - This could be very interesting. Now, what vital question shall I ask? - 36, 22, 36. - Tell me, are you a German spy? - Ja wohl mein herr. - I knew it. What other vital question can I ask? Tell me, before you do drop off, do you think we have time to? We don't. Pity. - One more question. - Well, she's made a come back. - Call me tomorrow darling. (kisses) - Game, set and match to England. (dramatic music) - Donner and Blitzen. - [Men] Ja wohl. - Hmm. (knocks) Anything the matter Mata? - No, come in darling. (door shuts) (Colonel shouts) - Listen, after him. (dramatic music) - Links links. (laughs) - [Lurk] Groping not again. - Lurk! - Hey. (dramatic music) (girls chatter) - Ah. - Hey you, listen what do you think you're doing? - (mumbles) (women chatter) - Dirty old man. (women chatter) - Good evening. - Evening. - What are you doing in there? - The Sergeant said, buy the right dress, now you cannot buy the right dress in France today. So I saw this lot, oh he'll love that. - I better go and call the police. - Oh please don't, don't call. - I shall scream for help. - No don't scream. I've got a splitting headache. Besides I'm British. You're all British aren't you? - [Women] Yes, of course we are! - We're doing the cabaret for Mata Hari. - We're the famous Buttercup Girls. - Buttercup, I'll be pushing up the daisies if I don't get some help, the thing is I'm on a vital mission. - Mission? - Mission for the British government. British government, you've heard of the British government? - Yes. - I must complete it by November the 11th, 1918. - Why? - The war ends then doesn't it? - Oh, here who was that Scottish officer that came in? - He's not a Scottish officer, he's a spy, a German spy. - Oh, is he chasing you? - He's after my hide, in more sense of the word than one? - What do you mean? - Oh it doesn't matter, look please, I must disguise myself. - Disguise. - Quickly can you help me? - Yes, yes, I've got the very thing. Look, now look that should cover it. - Oh, no it won't not by a long shot. - Oh, oh, well how bout this one? - Ah now that's better. - That belongs to the assistant. - What assistant. - A very courageous person. - In that case it is bound to fit.

Yes it's true, it's me. - [Vincento] Relax, you are England's savior. (trumpets blast) - Summer 1939 and looking not a day older. - [Radio] Had no such undertaking had been received and that consequently this country is at war with Germany. - Ah nonsense. The young people today would never allow it. (bells chime) - Now then, did you hear that? - What? - These jerrys are at it again. - Are they?
