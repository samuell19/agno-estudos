It's like she done sunk her acrylic nails into every other man at this church. And you keep letting her think she has a chance. And until you stop that, she's gonna keep trying it. - I have never, never given in to any of her advances. The whole church knows who she is.

It's cool, I don't mind answering his questions. I mean, if it was my only daughter bringing me some guy I never met before, I'd probably be the same way.

You would've heard me if you were listening to me and instead of Haven. - Don't start with that. You know when my daughter is concerned, it's about her. - (scoffs) Yeah. - All right. - Yeah, you right. - But what about when this baby gets here? Hm? Is this baby gonna get that same treatment? Hm? And does, does Haven even know? - When this baby gets here, I'm going to treat her the same way. - Mm-hmm, you better. 'Cause one thing I won't have is my baby feeling inferior to Haven. You don't have to worry about that. - Uh-huh, okay. It's not the right time. No, no, when you're gonna tell her? You gonna wait 'til I'm pushing or something? - I got it, baby, okay?

Charges remain unseen. - It's gonna be all right. Just calm down. It's just a misunderstanding, it's okay. It's all right, calm down. - [Chad] Mr Reynolds do you have any quotes? - [Hosea] No comment. - But Mr Reynolds. - [Hosea] No comment. (Haven crying) No I do not. - He, he. He. He. I can't. He's been an dope dealing liar this whole time. - Just relax. - You listen to me. Your daddy, he might be a lot of things, but something tells me if nothing, he does love you. Unlike that no good bastard that killed my daughter. Not that man. That man is Satan himself. You see, my gift of discernment is sharper. I can read anybody. From the moment I laid my eyes on that negro, I knew he wasn't no good. I begged and I begged and I begged her to cut him loose, but he had a hold on her so tight. It almost suffocated me. And then she told me for my family, but baby, the night you showed up on my porch, I promise you, girl was like, like granna had seen my angel straight from heaven. - Thank you, granna. - Your mother is proud of the woman that you are becoming baby. - I can't believe your father wanted to kill me. Why? I had nothing to do with anything. - That nigga ain't my daddy. Just some nigga that nutted in my mama. That's it. Haven, the day that Chop showed me that picture of you I literally was tripping. I just met you. And he talking 'bout, get close to you. Get you to trust me. I was supposed to bring you into him. - Were you gonna kill me? - Honestly, I was just, I was just gonna listen to his orders, but Haven something changed. Everything changed, Haven. Look, it's not just because we had sex. It's that conversation we had in your closet. I knew you were a real deal and I understand why you were sent to me. I get it, now. Look, it may have started out, by some plan the enemy started, but God turned it around for us. - Hey, hallelujah! Okay. Yes, grand baby. - Grandma. - Oh, baby, I'm sorry. You know how I get what God shows himself approved. I'ma hush. - Is that what you' trying to tell me that night. - Yeah. - I meant everything I said Haven. I meant it. I just hope that you can forgive me. - Okay, what about Chop? - [Asa] Look. - What if he tries to kill me? - You ain't gonna have to worry about him no more. Okay? My three girls are protected. All right? - What? What are you talking about three girls. - Granna. You. And my little princess baking in there. (Haven chuckles) - And here you go. How do you know it's a girl? - I don't, but granna said it, so it must be law. - [Haven] Not granna. (all laughing) - We just gonna run with it. We just gonna go with it but look, we gonna start a new life. Us three. Our love, honesty, respect, all that other stuff you were telling me. It's over now. Okay? All right? Don't worry. I got you. Okay? (police sirens) - [Guard] Reynolds. - [Kidnapped girl] Get off me! What is going on? Please get off of me! No! - [Kidnapper] Ah, shut the fuck up. (gunshots) (bible thuds) (Hosea exclaims) - Love you. - I love you too. (intense music) (inmates speaking indistinctly) (dramatic music) - You good? (sighs) I'm so disgusted by these charges. I won't even beat around the bush. You're going down. And if I have anything to do with it, it's gonna be for a long time. - Whatever, man - I've seen people get arrested for almost everything under the sun. So the drugs and the murders don't really surprise me. But what doesn't surprise me is that you have the audacity to play with God by claiming to be a servant of his. You give good pastors who are really about this life, a bad name. - I don't know what you're talking about. Those things that you found, don't belong to me. And I don't know how it got there. All right? As a man of God, as a man of the cloth I would never, never, never do anything to disrespect God. - Wow! Unbelievable. I stand in front of my congregation every Sunday and Wednesday doing my best to lead God's people back to him and pray that I don't do anything to make them fall while under my leadership. I'm responsible for those souls that I'm teaching. Do you not understand that their blood is on my hands if I were to lead them astray? (deep breath) - Those people are grown and they're gonna do what they wanna do, no matter what I say. And if they were really so holy, they would realize that I picked out the scriptures that hyped them up to make them fork off for money. - They may be grown. But what about your daughter? - Baby? What are we doing here? - Get out. (thunder roaring) (trap music) ♪ I don't trust ya ♪ I don't love you bitch ♪ I'm cold as ice ♪ I thought you was the one ♪ Now I'm thinking twice ♪ Bitches fuck me, I'm a thug, I don't feel a thing ♪ ♪ I gave you all had ♪ Ain't no more than that ♪ Look me in my eye and tell boldest lie ♪ - [Chop] Move! ♪ Bitch you know I'm gangster ♪ Know the ball on fire - What is he doing? - Sit down. Sit your ass down! ♪ The nerve of this little pussy ♪ ♪ It's an evil eye - You think I'm some kind of fool, baby? - No, baby, no. No, no, no. You know I don't think that. - I don't know that shit. But what I do know is just that you still haven't told me that you was pregnant. Fuck is up with that. - I was, I was going to, I swear I was, baby. Just listen. I was just trying to find the right time to tell you. I thought, I thought that maybe if I told you the right way, he would accept it. (Chop scoffs) - Believe this broad? (both chuckle) - I, I'm telling the truth, baby. Listen, I just, I know you weren't there for Trouble when he was born and maybe this is our chance. Maybe now we can be a family. Maybe God is giving you another chance. - (laughing) You said, God? You talking about the same God that you and that bitch ass nigga Keys is using to pimp the saints whenever the door to the church is open? (thunder roaring) You talking about that God? You talking about that God? You funny as shit. She funny as shit, ain't she? (laughing) You is a funny mother fucker. (Chinirika laughing) - You know the only thing funny is trying to reason with a man like you. Shit, I should have been left your ass. (tense music) None of this shit is worth it. And Keys, would've been a way better daddy to this baby than you could ever be. Shit, he was a way better boss. That nigga stole your dope. Started from nothing and still leveled up on your ass. (scoffs) I see why you mad. (gun clicks) (repeated gunshots) (Shea shouting) - Put that on God! Put that on God! - Damn. I ain't see that coming. (cocks gun) Just like you didn't see this. Yeah. Yeah. See you and Keys are alike in many ways. Y'all both about money. Get rid of any nigga that get in y'all way. But the difference between y'all two is; unlike him, you let your feelings guide you. And you don't always know who on your team. Big ass mistake. - Nigga, I always know who I got in my squad. - Really? So tell me, you knew Kenya's brother was on your team? (thunder roars) - What the fuck you talking about? (gunshot) (Chop screams) Ah shit! - Bitch ass nigga. - You bitch ass nigga! (gun clicks) - Probably shouldn't have used all your bullets on your little boo right here. (chuckles) Imagine. Just imagine your mother gettin' the car the night before Christmas, and the police telling her her only daughter being shot. Nigga, you know how it feel to hear the woman that birthed you struggle to breathe after hearing that shit? But oh, what a God we serve, right? What a God we serve. 'Cause right when we rushed in, the doctors told us they was able to bring Kenya back. (cocks gun) - Kenya alive? (gunshot) (Chop yelling) - Did I fuckin' say talk? - You bitch. - Did I say talk? - Bitch ass nigga. - I made my sister a promise sitting next to her hospital bed. I told her my niece will be taken care of. (chuckles) Before I take my last breath you and keys will already taken yours. (Chop wincing) - Nigga, you must have forgot you talking about, ah shit. Nigga, you was saying all that shit about who all on everybody team you early. You must've forgot who had on my fuckin' team, nigga. (Chop winces) If I don't show up as planned later on Trouble and all them niggas gonna be on your head. 'Cause they knew I was coming to meet your bitch ass. (wincing) Oh shit. - [Man On phone] Is it done yet? - Almost. Your boy here seems to think that y'all gonna be on my head when he don't meet up with y'all later. You know, considering the fact everybody knew he was me. - [Man] I thought you was calling to tell me his body was stinking by now. - What the? - [Man] After all the shit that he done caused us. - [Chop] Fuck. - Indeed. - Man, fuck that nigga. - Indeed. I'll pull up when it's done. - [Chop] (whispering) Fuck. - My mama's favorite scripture for as long as I can remember was Galatians six and seven. Do not be deceived. God will not be mocked. A man reaps what he sows. Good or bad. You reap the benefits of what you plant. - Nigga, shut that shit up! Don't nobody wanna hear no god damn sermon. Nigga wanna commit a sin and it all holier than thou. Nigga, you might as well go ahead kill me now, nigga, so. - As you please. (gunshot) - [Guard] Reynolds, you got a visitor. (inmates shouting indistinctly) Open cell five. (cell buzzes) - Baby girl. You alive. God knows I was worried about you. - You was worried about me? Were you worried about me when you lied to me my whole life? (intense music) - Haven, listen to me. I don't know what you heard about me, but I did what was best for you at the time? - (scoffs) No. What was best for me? What was best for me would've been for you to tell me the truth. What was best for me was be, be for you to open your eyes! For you to have not have lied and preached things that you didn't even believe your damn self. That's what would've been what's best for me. But instead you knew how hurt I was that I didn't have a mother and instead, instead of you, instead of you spending as much time with me as you could. What was best for me would you for you to live a life of honesty, but you lied to an entire congregation. I already lost my mother to cancer, but here you are sacrificing your life and mine every day and you have to audacity to try to tell me what's best for me. (deep exhale) You're right, baby girl. I was selfish and consumed with being the biggest kingpin to ever do it. But your mama, she really was the love of my life. And I put her in harm's way too. - What? What do you mean, you put her in harms way? (slams table) Dad, what do you mean you put her in harms way? Stop lying to me. What? What happened? - She didn't die of cancer, baby. (Haven crying) Baby. Baby, what's wrong? Haven? Baby. Yo, guard, guard, get my daughter! Get my daughter. - What's wrong with her? - She's breathing heavy, man. We was just talking right there. I don't even know what happened! - Get back. Medic, we need a medic in here. We need a medic in here. Have a seat! Sit down! (suspenseful music) (Haven hyperventilating) - What's her name? - Haven Reynolds. - Haven, can you hear me? - [Hosea] Baby. - She's hyperventilating. (Haven breathing heavy) - Check her pulse. - How far along are you? - [Hosea] Pregnant? - Ma'am, how far along are you? Yeah, she's pregnant, we have to take her to the E.R. Let's go. - I guess you're not the only one with secret. (heavily breathing) - [Medic] Come on, let's go. Let's go, let's go. (Haven breathing heavily) (intense electronic music) - (gasp) Ooh, Mi's here. - [Asa] Hey babe, babe, what you doing? - Hmm, here come little miss fastness. - Uh-uh, granna. Don't do my bestie like that. - I got it, baby. Just rest, okay. Gonna go and get Mi. - Mm. - Hey, bro! - What's good, sis! - How you doing? - I'm good, I'm good. - I see you still your Omarion's in. Okay! (Asa humming) Touch! (both laughing) Granna, darling! - Hey little miss fastness. - Oh. (Asa chuckling) - Come on over and gimme my hug. - Hi. (Haven laughing) (Haven and Mila screaming) - Look at, Ti Ti baby. - Stop that, you psycho. You know, every time you do that, it takes her hours to settle back down. - Man. - Well hurry up and spit her out then so I can spoils her. (Haven laughing) Oo, before I forget. Ba-yow! - Wow. What? - One for you and one for you, sir. Yeah, mm-hmm. - Uh huh. - What's that? - Ah! Is this what I? Ah! Yes! (Haven squealing) - Well what is it? - It's my degree! With honors! - Praise god! (Granna laughing) - Yes, I'm so proud of you. - Oh, my goodness, I actually did it. I am so sorry that I couldn't walk with you like we always planned, Mi. - Oh, I know. That's why I didn't walk. - What? - Calm down. You know, I wasn't about to walk that stage without my sister. - Oh. - So this just means when we get our masters, you better not be full of another baby 'cause we gone twerk across the stage. (Haven exclaiming) Ah, ah! - Aye, ah, ah! (both celebrating) - Aye, oh, baby mama! Ah, ah. Ah! - Hey, what's wrong, babe? Hmm? - You open. - What is is? Baby you went and got your GED? - Yeah. - What, why didn't you tell me? - I ain't wanna disappoint you just in case I failed. - Maybe you can never disappoint me. The fact that you stepped out on faith and took the test, I am so proud of you. (Asa sighs) - All right now, what does it say? - Oh, okay. (Asa deep takes deep breath) Okay. - If you don't spit out that tea. - Um. Uh. It says, (mellow guitar music) it says, that my baby passed all four sections with honors! - (clapping) Hallelujah. Praise god! - I passed? Yes, look, babe! - [Mila] Yes! - Ah! (both laughing) - Oh, my God. - Yes. - [Granna] Amen. - I'm so proud of you. - Thank you for not making me feel dumb. Talking down on me. Granna you too. That really helped me. - I will always believe in you because I know for a fact that God has higher plans for you. Congratulations. - Thank you. - Mm. - Look, I know, God got something better for me. - Oh? - 'Cause instead of going to just, you know, regular college. - Mm-hmm? - I'ma go to seminary school. - Oh, hallelujah! Won't he do it? - No he didn't! - Go head, grand baby! Yes, Jesus. - [Haven] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ah! Okay, so what's going on? Oh, what's going on? - I think I met someone. - Child, you think or you know? - You know what I mean? - No, I don't know what you mean because you definitely pick the crunchiest men I've ever found, - Uh. - in your entire life. So tell me which creature from the Bikini Bottom have you chosen this time? (laughing) - If you weren't pregnant I would push you off this bed. They are not that bad. - They are horrible. Like horrid. - Mm-hmm. - So. - Yeah, you right. - Okay. - Justin did look like he was related to Squidward. - The way that he sounded! - (nasally) Squidward. - (nasally) He was like, Mila, I love you. (both laughing) - Oh, I was so bad. - Oh! Oh. Ow. - You okay? - I think my water just broke. - What? Oh my. - No, no. Ow. - Grandma! Asa! Breathe, are you okay? - (heavily breathing) Yeah. - [Both] What's wrong?! - I think her water just broke. We gotta go. - [Asa] Uh. - We gotta go. - Boy, if you don't get your shoes and get that damn car! - Okay, I'll get it, all right. Do, granna, do I need to the um. - Boy that day dropped you on your head is coming back to haunt me, move! - He is something, is he? (laughing) Oo, ooh, oo, okay, okay, okay. (gentle music) (monitor beeping) - [Doctor] You did great, Haven. - Thank you. - You too, dad. - Thank you. - My babies done had a baby. (soft chuckles) - Oh my gosh. I can't believe, I'm a mom. - Oh, well believe it, honey. And it's about to get real, real. Wait 'til that child start waking up every two hours to eat. - [Haven] Oh. - And don't come looking for granna 'cause I'm going to be down Mr. Rufus' house. (laughing) Oh, what? - [Asa] Granna. - This old lady ain't dead yet. Besides Mr. Rufus as fine as he wanna be. Look like a young Billy Dee. - I know that's right. (both laughing) - You know, I'ma have to, I'ma have to go down and see about this, Mr. Rufus. And see what he talking about. 'Cause granna you can't. - You don't be out here hating on granna. - Mm-hmm. (Haven laughing) - I ain't hatin'. (granna laughing) - Mm, you wanna hold her? - Yeah - Yeah. - Yeah. - All right, now. - Come on, you got her. - Easy, grandson. - Hold on. Hold on. - Hold her head. - Okay, okay. (monitor beeping) - Just like that. - [Haven] Daddy. (Mila chuckling) - What's wrong with you, baby girl? - (sighs) Nothing, it's. I'm so, I'm so appreciative of you guys all thank you with me, it's just, I'm just realizing that neither of my parents are here to experience this with me. - Look, I understand baby, but I, I'm just grateful you got an opportunity to talk to your daddy and forgive him. Forgiveness is everything, baby. - [Haven] Yes. Yeah. - Now, have you all decided what you gonna name this child? I mean, we can continue to call her gorgeous because that's exactly what she is. - (laughing) Yeah, we did. That's unfortunate that Haven's parents aren't here to experience this with us but we still wanted to honor them so we decided to name her Kenya Hosanna Thomas. - Amen. - Did someone say my name? (granna gasps) - Mom? - Oh, that's the God I serve. - Mom? - Yes, baby, yes. (both crying) (indistinctly speaking through tears) - Oh, my good. Oh, let me see my baby. - Oh, you gotta meet her. - Oh, my god. - Oh, look at. (Asa chuckling) - Oh, you're a grandma. - You sweet beautiful baby. (whispering indistinctly) - [Kenya] Granny's here now. (laughing) - We did it. - We did it. - Oh, look at. - I'm so proud of you. - Hey. - Asa! If you had to taken any longer to open that door, you was gonna have to change my diaper. (Kenya laughing) - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - How you doing baby? - I'm good. - You ain't keeping up no trouble, are you? - No. - Okay, good. Now, get out my way. I'm here to see my granddaughter. - Yeah. - Where is Gigi's baby? - She's right here. - [Kenya] Gigi's baby, come here to grandma. - Here she is. - Bring her to me. Let me see here. - Hi there, little Kenya benya. - Hey. - Hi, stinker. (Haven sighs) - Hey, Meech. Let me holler at you for a minute. - [Kenya] How are you doing baby? - All right. - [Kenya] Oh my goodness. Did you know that your name was... (Asa sighs) - Man, they say whoever killed O'Shea, put two bullets in his body. - It was three. - Man, look. I know you was O'Shea's right hand man for years, but I need you to understand, I need to make sure I can trust you. - Look, man. My business was with O'Shea. Long as you take care of Haven and that baby, we good. - (chuckling) All right. (hip hop music begins) - Damn, fool. How is he? - Well, he's finally resting. I'm surprised he's still alive after all the blood he's lost. You sure you don't wanna take him to the hospital? - Look, no hospitals, no visitors. Nobody can know he's here.
