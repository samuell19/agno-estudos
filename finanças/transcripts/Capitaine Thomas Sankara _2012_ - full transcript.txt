"Revolutions that occur around the world are never identical. Each revolution has its own originality. And so has our August revolution." Comrade president... You Know… Every day, each of you should remember one thing: When the people rises, imperialism shakes. That's why I'll show you that I'm ready against imperialism. CAPTAIN THOMAS SANKARA And believe me, this is not a toy. Those bullets are real bullets. And when we shoot those bullets, it will be against imperialism. What remains to be done is Revolution. Down with Imperialism! Down with neo-colonialism! Down with racism! Down with puppet politics! Glory to the people! Dignity to the people! Power to the people! - Homeland or Death, - We shall overcome! Thank you comrades. On 4 August 1983, Thomas Sankara burst into the daily routine of a generation lost for orientation. At the time in Africa, thinking was risky, dreaming, almost forbidden. He often used a marxist vocabulary, for lack of better options. He was mostly trying "to clean out the dead wood", according to Benin scholar Stanislas. "4 YEARS OF CLEANING OUT DEAD WOOD" "One cannot bring deep changes without a touch of madness. Something that verges on non-conformism, the courage to turn one's back on ready made formulas, the courage to invent the future." Upper Volta has hit the headlines with a new coup led by Captain Sankara, former prime minister, who has toppled the regime of President Ouédraogo. This is the President who was toppled today. Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo was a moderate man who favored close cooperation with France. - What is to become of him? - "He will be dealt with humanely", says his former prime minister who toppled him, Captain Sankara. He announced last night on national radio that a National Council of the Revolution (CNR) had overthrown the puppet regime of Commander Ouédraogo. People of Upper Volta, On this day, 4th August 1983 the soldiers and officers of all armed forces and all units, have decided in a patriotic surge to sweep away the unpopular regime, the regime of submission and subjection set-up by doctor commander Jean-Baptiste Ouédraogo. People of Upper Volta, all forward with the CNR. This is the great patriotic fight for the bright future of our country. Homeland or Death, we shall overcome! "UPPER VOLTA: A 33 YEARS OLD ANTI- IMPERIALIST CAPTAIN SEIZES POWER" - Where does he come from? - He's the son of a Fulani and a Mossi woman. A brilliant pupil, he is noticed by the catholic priests who hope to send him to the seminar. He himself wants to become a medical doctor but as he doesn't get a grant, he reluctantly chooses a military carreer. - So it's not a calling? - Not at all! His destiny is shaped in Madagascar, where he attends the military Academy Indeed, he witnesses first hand the great Madagascar shift towards socialism. - And he's thrilled? - Yes. Let's add that this exceptional military man is also interested in economics, in political science, in journalism... - A curious mind, then? - Very eclectic, yes. In Madagascar, he also perfects his French. He would become a great orator in our language. After Madagascar, he spends some time in France with the para troopers and later in Morocco, where he befriends his comrade, Blaise Compaoré. - You mean, the current president of Burkina Faso? - Yes. He succeeded Sankara in circumstances we'll come back to. After Morocco, Sankara gets back home and distinguishes himself in a little war opposing Upper Volta and Mali about a few acres of land. - What do you mean by "distinguishes himself" ? - This young officer displays real qualities as a fighter, as a leader... That gets him to lead a military school training commando troops. His friend Compaoré becomes his right arm. By then, Sankara is the most famous military man in Burkina Faso. Soon the Captain leads a small group of leftist or far leftist officers, all resolutly anti-colonialist. But the real personal motivation of Sankara is the corruption of the Voltaic elite, which revolts them and guides their action. And also the certainty that the country has to manage by itself. - Meaning, without depending on France? - You get it! We find France's African politics very French. - How do you mean? Before, France was present in an African country either to maintain a chief or a leader or to fly in another one that they brought in their luggage. Today, France still does the same. - What's France's position in your alliances? To us, France is the country that colonized our land. It is responsible for the colonial and post-colonial system in our country. France must understand that we will always fight colonialism and neo-colonialism. What's wrong? - She seems a little worried... - Yes, a bit! - Still, I find you a little bit too enthusiastic… - Well, this young leader was blowing a fresh wind over a continent plighted by misery and corruption. Finally, here was a man prepared to tackle the destiny of his country hands-on. Remember that Sankara aroused considerable sympathy. He represented a new kind of third world leadership. Many made the trip to Ouagadougou to meet this nice president, who took part in cycling races and grabbed his guitar at any opportunity. - His friend Compaoré, was he part of this Council? - Of course. Compaoré became Sankara's right hand, his advisor, his confidant. A true twin brother. Thomas Sankara, 35 years old Captain, President of Upper Volta. He rose to power through a coup on 4th August 1983. He is most ardently supported by the poor. Comrades! - Imperialism, - Down with it! - Colonialism, - Down! - Neo-colonialism, - Down! Comrades, We must bury every enemy of the people. We must bury every flaw that stops the people from freeing itself, from being the architect of its own happiness. We cannot develop without mobilizing. We cannot develop if the people itself doesn't take its destiny in its own hands It's up to the people to build the country. No one else. Today, it's 20 villas… Tomorrow it will be 20 schools, 20 health stations, 20 maternity wards and it will go on like that every year. - Comrades! The bad husbands, - Down with them! - The lazy bums, - Down! - The thieves, - Down! - The reactionary husbands - Down with them! - The small bosses, - Down! - The big bosses, - Down! - The embezzlers, - Down! - The thieves, - Down! - Homeland or Death, - We shall overcome! - Homeland or Death, - We shall overcome! - Long live the revolution, - Long live Captain Sankara. - I'd like to ask President Sankara a question: As the leader of a country that is small, landlocked and poor, no offense intended, what do you get from this, beyond intellectual satisfaction? When one speaks loud, what does one gain from it? Our circumstances are very difficult, you described them fairly, thank you. To these difficult circumstances, you have to add the fact that our people is lagging far behind, that it is very largely illiterate. So if, despite these natural, physical, sociological circumstances, we still believe in development, it is our duty to explain. Explain and convince requires to talk a lot, to speak loudly, and as clearly as possible, We don't speak for rhetorical effect. We speak to lead men and women to work concretely, to do the work that will close the gap and make up for nature's harshness. What matters is not that others listen to me. What matters is that the people of Burkina listen and understand that we must work. And that if we don't work, we will carry on falling behind. Mr. President, I didn't need much time to realize that President Sankara has to be taken very seriously. Our objectives are limited to very simple goals: firstly, to feed every Burkinabé, to educate him, give him health care and clothing, and also to allow him to grow and blossom culturally. To achieve all this, we need economic, cultural and political programs, and even a security program. For I'm sure you know very well that not everyone approves of Burkina Faso and its revolutionary ways, that is, a change from what was prevailing before, which everyone knows. - Homeland or Death, - We shall overcome! "LONG LIVE THE CNR" (National Council of the Revolution) Do not trust appearances. This martial demonstration in Ouagadougou hasn't been put up to honor some dictator. It is celebrating production: the decision of Burkina Faso to overcome hunger and to achieve food self-sufficiency. Our country produces enough to feed ourselves. We can even increase our production. Unfortunately, because of our lack of organization, we are still reaching out and begging for food aid. Food aid traps us. It inscribes in our brains the habit of assistance, the reflexes of a beggar. With our great production, we must make food aid obsolete. We must produce more, because it's normal that he who feeds you also runs your life. Let's only consume only what we control! Some are asking: "but where is imperialism?" Look in your plates when you eat: the imported rice, corn, millet... That is imperialism! Let's look no further. Let's look no further. - Is it important to you? - Yes it's very important. We need to be self-sufficient food wise. To eat, we must produce our own food. In some countries, just 4% of the population can feed a whole population of 200 million people. They even export food. They turn agriculture into an economic power. Here 90% of our people are farmers, but still, we are not self-sufficient. The 8th poorest country of the world, Burkina Faso refuses "colonial" international aid. "We refused 500 tons of rice offered by Moscow. That aid is pathetic and humiliating. Such a small quantity cannot save us from starvation" When I was in Moscow, in the Soviet Union We visited many historical sites, museums, but also "Star City". "Star City" is where the soviets train their astronauts. We saw the rockets. It's impressive, I have to agree. Soyuz, Saliut, Mir, etc. They know lots of things. They don't talk to the earth any more they already talk to the moon… Then, as always, I was asked to sign the guest book. I signed, of course. I was asked to congratulate the astronauts, I did, of course. We were asked to admire this and that. We admired, of course. To bow in front of… Gagarin's statue. We bowed, of course. Then, we were going to depart. But I said: "No, comrades! this isn't over, wait". It's all fine. We are happy. Congratulations, this is progress, and when all this will get back to the people, it will really be good. But I want to ask you one thing: "Two seats!" You have to train two Burkina astronauts as well. We too want to go to the Moon. So let's start our collaboration. And we mean it. We want to send people to the Moon. So there will be Americans, Soviets, a few other countries, and there will be Burkina Faso too… Mir space station October 1987 You have said that 1% of space research funding should be invested in the fight against deforestation. Where do you get this figure from? How did you calculate that? Beyond the figure, we want to raise awareness about the serious problem of desertification. - Let's see a few images of your country. The responsibility for the drought doesn't only lie with the Burkina people. but also with all those who, far from us, provoke climate and ecological changes. Who can be sure that those vessels we send into space don't disturb the balance of nature? - You said that the struggle against desertification is anti-imperialist? Yes. Because we know that for imperialism, exploitation of humans is perfectly normal. That's even more true for exploitation of forests, be it directly or indirectly. "TO SAVE OUR ENVIRONMENT LET'S PLANT TREES" "ANY ECONOMIC ACTION MUST INCLUDE AN ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECT" "Reforestation campaign 10 million trees planted" One essential question remains for this african country: It needs cultural development to reach its goals. But for now only 6% of the children are educated, and they represent 50% of the population. The struggle for development also requires to fight against illiteracy. "Even 100% of our budget wouldn't be enough to send all the country's children to school. Soon there will be a campaign: whoever can read will have the duty to teach a few people otherwise we will prevent him to further educate himself." Comrades, - Reactionary pupils, - Down with them! - Lazy pupils, - Down! - Incompetent teachers, - Down! Comrades, - The slimy eyed owls, - Down with them! - The puffed up guinea fowls, - Down! Down with them! Down! Thank you, comrades. "In 4 years, the percentage of children going to school jumps from 6% to 22%" Let's build Upper Volta. Let's not betray it. Let's work our fields, in our factories, Let's raise our cattle. That is our dignity… In schools, how do we recognize the girls' emancipation? At schools, if a girl gets pregnant, she gets expelled, right? She gets excluded. But we never try to find out if the partner who got her pregnant is maybe right there, in the same classroom. And even if he's found there, he's left alone, the boy. So a boy can have as many babies as he feels like, from 5th grade through to high school, He'll never get expelled. But the girl, even if she's only one day away from her exams, There you go - Expelled! - Imperialism, - Down with it! - Husbands who beat their wives, - Down with them! - Husbands who torture their wives, - Down! - Homeland or Death, - We shall overcome! Without women's education, there's no salvation. At least that's what Sankara's regime believes, as it multiplies actions to change mentalities on subjects such as salary and excision. Women from Upper Volta present us with a great challenge because their liberation isn't easy. They are dominated by men who are themselves dominated. So they are doubly dominated. Imperialism dominates the Upper Volta man who then dominates the Upper Volta woman. We want the Upper Volta woman to become in charge, and this starts with her liberation. To free her from the feudal domination of the Upper Volta man… That is not easy. The whole mindset has to be questioned. You have to be brave enough to challenge some aspects of our culture which alienate women. So we believe that we must challenge particular mutilations, sexual mutilations. We see these sexual mutilations as a way to belittle women, to brand women with their permanent inferiority. Because you are a woman, you must be branded with this sign of defect forever. Daily 14 hours of work, a life expectation of 32 years. The african woman performs 80% of the field work and half of the activity needed to meet food needs. These women take care of: children, housework, gathering wood, fetching water miles away, feeding the family, cultivating their husband's field as well as their own. A far cry from an idyllic life in the bush… We have taken steps to show how important women are to us. The fulfilment of the couple leads to the fulfilment of the family, which leads to national development. So we have declared the market to be closed to women. Only sellers would be allowed in. And the men who wanted the meals to be ready, they had to go to the market themselves. Men here don't go to the market, that would be humiliating. It's not easy to challenge such prejudice and preconceptions Each of us here has been raised to think that just because he is a man he is automatically superior to anything female, whatever her age, her physical strength, her intelligence. In our government we have 3 women ministers: Family development & National solidarity, Sports and culture, Finance… So women start to think: "The National Revolution Council does really take women's liberation seriously." They are now the ones suggesting to us the women they consider capable. Little money in Burkina, but plenty of ideas. After Woman's week, compulsory market day for men, family charter, the local TV launches "the Doves of the Revolution". Let's hope the government doesn't let them down. Which means that we must give each woman a job. We must give each woman the means to earn a living honestly and decently. It can't wait. Now, we have to think about the roofing. They need to have the materials here. Don't forget to put a lot of green spaces along the road, Flowers, little concrete benches, public benches... - Mister President, do you think this fervour will last? In the beginning there were only words, and euphoria. Today it is clear that through this building... This building, constructed with support of the population, is the proof that the revolution brings something real. - Thank you - Thank you too, In order to encourage the workers' spirits, Capt. Sankara regularly visits the building sites and mucks in himself. "1 year free rent, and home construction program" "All-out mobilization to build dams" Launch of a "Railway Battle" "100 km of railways built bare hands" "HEALTH FOR PEOPLE = VACCINES TO THE PEOPLE" "2,5 million children vaccined in 15 days" Launch of the "Revolution Defence Committee" New "People's Revolution Tribunal" Saye Zerbo, our court condemns you to 15 years of prison, including 7 years suspended. It condemns you to pay back to the Voltaic state the sum of 61 million 838 thousand 101 francs. When the people becomes the supreme magistrate… then corruption is restricted. "FOR A JUSTICE SYSTEM SERVING THE PEOPLE" The fight against corruption began in Ghana with Captain Rawlings. In Burkina Faso, the People's Revolution Tribunals are now in session. Former heads of State are confronted, hundreds of corrupt civil servants unmasked. "I spent 10 millions..." That's the problem! Everyone helps himself and then says: "General Lamizana told me to draw the money". Corruption does play a certain role in our country. But we have fought it not so much because of it's negative economic impact, but because of it shaping a negative kind of man, and a mind that leads to bribing, to nepotism, to mess, to incompetence. "My net monthly salary amounts to 138'736 CFA francs. I also own three guitars. I mention them because they are worth a lot to me." One of the Captain's decisions met with surprise: the closure of the night clubs which were blossoming in the two main cities. I made this decision against my own will as I'm a musician myself. But we wanted to confront our petty bourgeois class head-on. We wanted to demonstrate that there are sacrifices that have to be made for the Revolution. Sacrifice on privileges, tastes etc. We have chosen the night-clubs because they are meeting points for the bourgeoisie, who practices discrimination by upping prices. A bottle of coke there can cost the monthly salary of a farmer, if not even half a year's salary of some farmers of Upper Volta. A single bottle of coke. So People's Ballrooms have replaced the night clubs. A people's ballroom is a large dancefloor, an orchestra, very reasonably priced drinks 50 CFA for a coke, when in a night club it could be 1000 or 2000 CFA. And in those ballrooms, you meet workers, peasants, ministers, everybody - the boss... All together. - Do you go there yourself? - I do! But as a musician, not as a customer. Opening of "People's Ballrooms" "Man is a total being. Culture is an expression that liberates him." "10th Panafrican Film and Television Festival of Ouagadougou" Unveiling the "monument to Film makers" "NYAMANTON, A lesson from garbage" by Cheick Oumar Sissoko Building "Ouagadougou People's Theater" Lauching a "National Culture Week" - As I visited a "Revolution Defence Committee" office yesterday, I notice a poster saying something like: "Secret Ballot is the greatest swindle" Is that your opinion? Yes it is our opinion. Because, in our case... What does a secret ballot mean? Firstly, the ballot, this piece of paper, what does it mean for 98% of Burkina's population? They don't know how to read or write. They never held a paper in their hands. Over 98% of our population is illiterate. How could we... Well, it's not good for us. And then, there are all those manipulation, even when people can read. The computers, you know, sometimes they can be made to say all sorts of things, right? So, taking all those very valid fears into account, we have preferred, for the elections... You climb onto a table or anything that can raise you a bit, and your followers just line up behind you. Then they get counted: they are 1200. The other one has only 800, so he's beaten. Plus this has the advantage to show who has voted for you... With the secret ballot, how many… In short, the merits of that method are so numerous that we can export that progress. We can export our progress... No. In truth, with a very illiterate population it would be very difficult to talk about a secret ballot. That would make no sense. It doesn't mean much, really. And note that wherever people can read, there is a lot of abstentionism. So where they don't know how to read, almost 100% do vote. And where they can read, they abstend. Which means that paper is no good. But others don't know that. "- What is democracy for you?" "Democracy cannot be imagined unless all forms of power are put in the hands of the people. Economic, military, political, social and cultural power." He came to Vittel in fatigues, with cap, revolver, and his sharp tongue. Capt. Sankara was one of the stars of the 10th Vittel summit. He is seen as a young lion of Africa a troublesome character, but who also wants to build a different future with France. France doesn't understand Africa, it's high time it did. Stop seeing Africa as a mere commodity which has to follow instructions. Accept a grown-up Africa which understand its own interests, and legitimately defends them, who claims the right to be different. And there already has been a hiccup in this summit. President Sankara, a military man who has links with the Libyans, refused to attend last night's dinner offered by the President MItterrand. Capt. Sankara is a Marxist, but also an admirer of Libya's No 1 I remind you that Capt. Sankara is a Pro Libyan. - Mr. President, could you specify what relations you intend to have to Libya? Those relations with Col. Gaddafi been much talked about, but I think there's nothing to worry about when you deal with responsible people. And that's our case. Ambassador of Libya, Stand up! I'll tell him you want water wells. Let him tell Gaddafi. Shall I tell him? The people demand wells! Let Gaddafi know! If there are no wells, the people will judge you. If there are no wells, the people will judge you. "I think people are trying to find an pretext against us by presenting us as helpers of Libyan politics." Sankara tended to help himself with other countries. For example one day, he told us how after giving an interview to Libyan TV, he asked the cameraman to take the tape out of the machine, then he seized the camera, stating: "Since Libya has promised to help us, I'll take the equipment right now." Col. Gaddafi said: "No, we'll send it to you properly." But as Sankara had got sick of waiting, he decided to help himself. He also stole a car from Col. Gaddafi, who had come to Ouagadougou in his armoured Alfa Romeo, crammed with gadgets. While Sankara and Gaddafi were conferring, Sankara's chauffeur was asking Gaddafi's driver: "how does your car work, how does this and that work?" and he ended up nicking his car... Then a few weeks later the most incredible thing happened: Sankara tried to steal a Boeing 727 from Libya by stopping the pilot of Libyan Airways to fly back to Tripoli. For a whole week, Sankara blocked the Boeing to Ouagadougou airport, trying to find pilots in Burkina who could fly that plane. But his pilots had been trained to fly the few Fokker prop planes that Burkina owned, and finally, for lack of pilots, Sankara had to give the Boeing back to Libya. Plus, Gaddafi had declared the plane stolen, and no airport would have given it landing authorization. I would like to salute the people of Cuba, the Cuban Revolution, and our great Comrade Fidel Castro, for his sharp understanding, and the internationalist sense of Cuba's engagement. That's why in Cuba, like here, we say: "Patria o muerte, venceremos." - What's Burkina Faso's position on the fight against apartheid? - Apartheid is a form of modern nazism. Apartheid is an active element of the imperialism of our time. We must fight apartheid not because we are black, but simply because we are men and not beasts. And also because within class struggle, we have chosen the class of the future: the class of the workers. Although in prison, Nelson Mandela is a thousand times freer and happier than those outside who serve the interests of the peoples' enemies, and of the arrogant imperialism of our time. For French-Burkina friendship! Forward! Down with Pieter Botha! Mr. François Mitterrand, gangsters like Jonas Savimbi, killers like Pieter Botha have had the right to visit beautiful and clean France. They have stained it with their blood drenched hands and feet. And all those who have allowed them to do so will bear the entire responsibility, here and elsewhere, today and forever. President Thomas Sankara is trouble! He always stirs things up, he asks questions… With him you cannot rest in peace, you can't have a clear conscience. Some of his judgements show the sharpness of his youth, and his total dedication to his people as a state leader. I praise these great qualities, but he is too inflexible. I think he is going too far. If I may talk to him from experience. Our country never had good ties with Sankara. - Why? Did he scare us? - Let's say he worried us, because he was out to challenge the very basis of the relationships between France and African countries. - In short, neo-colonialism? - Or "Françafrique", as it's been called... A complex network of lobbies and vested interests which has kept French speaking Africa in a state of dependence and turned it into a money pit. Moreover, Sankara didn't worry our leaders only, the old leaders of other African countries didn't welcome him either. - Risk of contagion? - Of course… Our revolution can only triumph, succeed and bear a meaning if the other peoples, in their own countries, struggle to get rid of the same evils we fight against. Who are Africa's enemies & allies? What ideology for Africa? Africa needs revolution and Africa will get it. Above all Africa needs unity, and African unity will be reached by force, because the peoples demand it. "25th summit of the countries of the Organisation of African Unity" Addis Abeba, Ethiopia, 29 July 1987 The President of Burkina Faso is now talking about the issue of African countries' debt. "AFRICA JUDGED BY THE IMF AND THE WORLD BANK" The debt cannot be paid back. The debt cannot be paid back, firstly because, if we don't pay, our debitors won't starve to death. Be sure of that. But if we pay, we will starve to death. Be sure of that as well. Mr President, My proposal is not aiming at provocation or showing off. I want to say here what all of us think and wish. Who doesn't wish the public debt cancelled? He who doesn't, may go out, board his plane, and go straight to the World Bank, and pay. If only Burkina Faso refuses to pay, I won't be here next time. But with support from all of us, which I need, with support from all of us, we can avoid to pay. When we say the debt cannot be paid it is not that we are opposed to morality, dignity, respect for the given word. It is that we don't abide by the same morality. For the rich and the poor, morality means different things. The Bible, the Coran, cannot serve in the same way he who exploits the people and he who is exploited. We should print two editions of the Bible and two editions of the Coran. Mr. President, Let's start, right now, a United Front against the debt. Let's decide here in Addis Abeba to limit the arms race between poor and weak countries. The sticks and knives that we buy are useless. I'm a soldier and I carry a gun. But Mr. President, I want us to disarm. Because I wear the only weapon that I own. While others hide the weapons they possess. So with everybody's support, we will manage to make peace amongst us. And let's also ensure that the African market becomes the market of the Africans. Produce in Africa, transform and consume in Africa. Let's produce what we need, and consume what we produce, rather than importing it. Burkina has come to display its cottonware, produced, woven and sewn in Burkina Faso to dress Burkina people. My delegation and myself are dressed by Burkina weavers. There's not one thread that comes from Europe or America. I'm not doing a fashion show, but I just want to say that we have to live as Africans. That's the only way to live free and in dignity. Thank you Mr. President. Homeland or Death, we shall overcome! Ouagadougou, near the city center, opposite the Republic's presidency. This man in yellow is Thomas Sankara, 38 years old, president of Burkina Faso. As every Friday between 5 and 6 pm, he plays handball with the civil servants. - When did you decide to take over in Burkina, in Upper Volta? - Actually, I never decided... to step forward as a leader. Because I think it is the people which steps forward, not an individual in this or that position. But unfortunately, or fortunately, I'm not sure, events have led me to serve and become president. - So you didn't feel a calling to become a politician? - Militant, yes. But to be in charge, at any level... No. I never identified with that. And even today, I am ready to occupy any position, as long as I can remain in the revolutionary struggle. "UN General Assembly, 39th session" New York, United States, 4 October 1984 Mr. President, Mr. Secretary General, Representatives of the international community. Allow me to say this: I am not only talking in the name of beloved Burkina Faso, but also for all those who are in pain. I speak in the name of the millions who live in ghettos because their skin is black, or they have a different culture. I suffer for the Indians, massacred, humiliated, stuck in reservations for centuries. I speak in the name of the women of the world who suffer under an exploitative system engineered by the males. I speak in the name of our poor countrie's mothers, who see their children die of malaria or diarrhaea, unaware that there are simple means to save them. I also speak in the name of the poor man's child, who hungers and hiddenly peeks at the riches piled up in shops for the rich. My thoughts go to all those affected by the destruction of nature, the 30 million people who will die each year, killed by the scary weapon of hunger. I speak in the name of the artists, poets, painters, musicians, actors, etc. Good people who see their art being prostituted in the tricks of show-business. I protest in the name of the world's sports people, whose muscles are exploited by politicians or merchants of modern slavery. I scream in the name of journalists, condemned to silence or to lying to avoid losing their work. I shout in the name of the jobless, who can glimpse life only through the reflection of the richer. I naturally tremble in the name of the ill, who anxiously scan the limits of a science dominated by weapon dealers. As a Military man, I cannot forget the one who obeys orders, finger on the trigger, knowing that the bullet he shoots only carries the message of death. Finally, I express outrage about the Palestinians, whom an inhumane humanity decided to swap for another people, itself tortured in the past. "I want to speak in name of all the Outcasts, because I am Man, and nothing which is human is foreign to me." Down with international reaction. Down with colonialism and neo-colonialism. Down with puppet regimes. Glory to the people who fight for their freedom. Glory to the people who choose to decide for themselves in dignity. Victory to the struggling people of Africa, Latin America and Asia. Homeland or Death, we shall overcome! Thank you. - According to you, what are the main changes since the "Popular Democratic Republic" took power? - I don't really like that question, because I'm involved, so I don't know. Here we say: "a dancer cannot know whether he dances well or not" Only others can say: "you dance well, or you dance badly". But I think that the main achievement is the transformation of the minds. Now the Burkina people are self-confident. They know that they can change their reality and their environment. Of course it's not automatic, but still, I think that's the most important bit. Forget the schools, health centres, dams, roads, buildings… But don't forget one thing: Burkinabé people are now aware, self-confident. That's the first and main victory. "We declare that from now on, nothing in Burkina Faso will happen without the involvement of Burkinabé people. Nothing that won't previously have been decided and developed by us. No longer will our decency and our dignity be assaulted" "BURKINA FASO: GRAVEYARD OF IMPERIALISM" - What does it mean for you to be a head of state? - A lot of reponsibilities. You have to be responsible for everything. You have to steer and sustain your people's joy, make sure that every day, minute and second no one is ever sad. Very difficult. We have a saying, I knew it, but now I see how true it is: "to lead his herd, a shepherd just needs a single stick," he can lead a herd of 100, 1000, 10'000 oxen. but to lead people, you need a different stick for each one. Some want a long stick, some a short one. To each one, you have to talk the talk he wants. My objective should be 8 million different talks, for each person. Not easy. - Were there also failures, and have you made personal mistakes? - Oh yes! We have had many, many failures and so many mistakes. But the difference is that before, we would make 100 mistakes, and we had zero victories. But now, we may make 10'000 mistakes, but we have maybe 2, 3 or 4 little victories. We go forward! Our mistakes are so numerous that I can't be specific. All these mistakes make me sad. "SEVEN CONSPIRATORS EXECUTED YESTERDAY" I take the responsibility because I'm the president. All the mistakes, they're mine, so that make me sad, often. - Those seven men shot for the Burkina Revolution, do you regret their execution? I think about it and I regret. - Some people talk about political prisoners in Burkina Faso, what do you answer them? I answer, yes, we had some, but we don't any more. - What is, for you, the main political quality? To believe in the people. In a way, I'm a bit like a cyclist, climbing a steep slope, who has a precipice both on his right and on his left, he has to pedal, to keep on pedaling, otherwise he falls. So, to remain myself and to feel myself, I too have to forge ahead. - Do you feel isolated within Africa? - Misunderstood, in any case. - Misunderstood? Misjudged? - Misjudged, yes. - Does Sankara realise he must react, and correct the excesses? - Yes, from mid 1987 onwards, he publically acknowledges the mistakes that were made. He declares that some citizens suffered injustice. "We must rectify", he says. - Is it a form of self-criticism? - Certainly. But it is too late... - Why? His assassination has already been decided? - For sure. And forgive the pun, but it is Sankara himself who is to be rectified. Don't take everything! - No, President, We'll just take what's right. - It's symbolic! See? he's fatter than me. Comrades, it's going to burst, that's too much. Blood Donor. - Homeland or Death, - We shall overcome! The red sun of the rainy season is slowly setting behind the palm trees of the "Entente" compound in Ouagadougou. The breeze is soft on this late afternoon, It's October 15, 1987, 4:30 PM A column of small cars - black Renault 5 - leaves the main road, gets onto a red mud street, and enters the compound. An extraordinary session of Burkina's National Revolution's Committee is about to begin. Killers are hidden in the first houses, next to the entry barrier and in the bushes nearby the path. A hand grenade tears the front vehicle apart. Paulin Bamouni, the Presidency's press officer and Frederic Ziembé, law advisor, are killed. Sankara and 9 guards manage to hide in a nearby pavillion. Crouched in the corridor, they shoot back. But the pavillion is surrounded. An offensive grenade is thrown inside. Wounded, Sankara says: "It's useless. It is me they are after". "It's useless. It is me they are after". He stands up, walks towards the door. A Kalashnikov flurry tears his body apart. The killers enter the shelter, shooting on all that's alive. After : "La victoire des vaincus" by Jean Ziegler, January 1988 When you have a weapon that can kill, and you can receive orders while standing attention under a flag, without knowing who benefits from these orders, who benefits from this gun, you become a potential criminal only waiting for the trigger to spread terror around you. A soldier without a political education is a potential criminal. "A SOLDIER WITHOUT A POLITICAL EDUCATION IS A POTENTIAL CRIMINEL" Thomas Sankara among the 100 dead of the coup. Burkina's ex-leader is already buried. It is his former friend, Blaise Compaoré, who has seized power. He promises democracy and continuation of the revolution. Africa is shaken once more by a coup d'Etat, Thomas Sankara, president of Burkina Faso, former Upper Volta, was killed yesterday during the assault of the presidential palace. The coup was led by the regime's number 2, personal friend of Sankara's, captain Compaoré. Blaise Compaoré, new leader of Burkina Faso, former Upper Volta, speaks on TV for the first time since the coup that lead him to power last week. Martine Laroche-Joubert talks with him about Burkina's future, and also about the motion after the assassination of his former friend, Thomas Sankara… - Do you feel regrets? Of loosing a friend, of course... And also, I regret that at one point in his life, he thought of eliminating us. That's a pity. Yeah, it's a pity. Blaise Compaoré, president of Burkina Faso, since 15 October 1987 "COMPAORE DENIES HAVING HIS FRIEND KILLED" Sankara was a soft hearted president, an idealist, an amazing character, probably the most surprising head of state in the world. So let's listen to some music by Ray Lema because Sankara was also a president who danced. Last Saturday he was dancing with us at an anti-apartheid forum in Ouagadougou and with him danced his best friend Blaise Compaoré. "5 days before being killed, Sankara was dancing with his best friend Blaise Compaoré." The most incredible is that Sankara's best friend, Blaise Compaoré, was the one who stirred up the coup. By the way in sunday's "Le Monde", there is an interview with Sankara that goes back a few months in which Sankara said the following about Compaoré. "One day, some men came to see me, in a panic." They said: "We've heard Blaise is preparing a coup against you." "They were seriously panicked." This is what I answered... The day you hear about a coup being prepared by Blaise against me... Don't even try to stop it, or even to let me know. It will be too late, there will be no way out. He knows so much about me… Nobody can protect me from him, if he wanted to attack me. Against me, he has weapons you know nothing about. If he prepares a coup, you have to accept fate. You have to let go, nothing can be done. - But you cannot imagine that he could do that? - No. No! It's so good to have a man you can tell everything, or nearly. And he guesses what you haven't dared tell him. It's good! - And rare? - Very rare. And it's also painful. Because it implies, for him, such effort to play a role be receptive. When I call Blaise at 4:00 AM, he has to accept to spend the whole night with me, to relax me, make me laugh, so I can carry on working. We spend night after night, after night... Which means, he can never have a problem. He has to live to look after an ill man, or… I don't know… It's unique. When I think about it… Because he too needs somebody to lean on. Who will bring him a balance. It makes me happy. I have at least that to make me feel better. He finished that interview saying: "I know that noone will ever say about me: This is the former Burkina Faso president. They will say: This is the former Burkina Faso president's grave." Dagnoen graveyard Ouagadougou, October 1987 Thomas Sankara's shadow weighs upon Ouagadougou today. Around his grave, the grief is tainted by a growing suspicion. Amongst the population, the suspicion of a premeditated assassination is spreading. Mistrust is growing in regard to the new power. "SANKARA, YOU WERE BETRAYED BY YOUR BEST FRIEND, WHOM YOU GAVE ALL YOUR TRUST. YOUR DEATH IS A TERRIBLE SHOCK FOR US…" "HE ENTERED THE CONTINENT'S LEGEND" Thomas Sankara, President of Burkina Faso, former Upper Volta 4 August 1983 - 15 October 1987 Thomas Sankara, a simple captain who unbaptised his country, Upper Volta, calling it Burkina Faso, i.e. Land of Upright People. "The Land of Upright People" still lives within the memory of this mythic figure. Why was this young revolutionary eliminated? Who decided to make him disappear? The proceedings, still in progress, haven't provided answers to these questions. But it is obvious that the fiery captain bothered many people in the world, and not only in his country. - Captain Thomas Sankara: why Burkina Faso? Why change the name of Upper Volta? Because "Upper Volta" didn't mean anything to anyone especially to us, Burkina people. It's a name that only refers back to a colonialist past. Whereas Burkina Faso is a local name which has a meaning in our language. - Which is? - Land of honest men. Thank you, President. English version: Philippe Ciompi, Sylvie Bringas, Katia Berger
