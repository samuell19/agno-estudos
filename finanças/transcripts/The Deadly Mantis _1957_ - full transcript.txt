For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. Radar. Designed to defend us against attack. Radar stations on mountaintops, in deserts, deep in untracked forests. In a thousand secret and isolated places. Over both oceans, there are radar equipped picket planes. In both oceans, manmade radar islands to guard our flanks. There are the inshore pickets and several hundred miles beyond them are the offshore pickets. Another radar fence stretches across the long, unfortified border between the United States and Canada. The Pine Tree Radar Fence. And beyond that, still another network of electronic eyes. The Mid-Canada Radar Fence. Even farther north in the very shadow of the North Pole, this fence, the distant early warning system known as the Dew Line, ready to transmit the first warning signal of a sneak attack across the polar regions. To build the Dew Line, an armada of ships was assembled in the largest and most secretly planned operation since the Normandy invasion. Grinding through treacherous polar ice fields in a desperate gamble against time and weather to land a mountain of supplies, machines, tractors, and men upon the ice. First things first. Level landing strips for heavy cargo planes. Then shelters for the men, for the planes, and for operations. And while some hands are busy laying long pipelines to transport fuel, others build tanks to store it. The work continues day and night around the clock, seven clays a week. At long last, the ships are gone. The summer is gone but the job is finished. Red Eagle One, sentinel of the arctic, nerve center of the Dew Line is operational. - Colonel Parkman arriving, dispatch jeep. Colonel Parkman. Glad to have you with us. - Across the roof of the continent, still father north, an outpost of the Dew Line. Hey Mike. Hey Mike, get a look at this. I don't see anything. Hey, wait a minute. Listen. It's almost on top of us! - This is Kane, Picket 7327, calling Red Eagle One. Come in, Red Eagle One. This is Kane, Picket 7327, calling Red Eagle One. Come in, Red Eagle One. - Hello, Picket 7327, ready, go when I read you, over. - Put the old man on the horn, will you, Pete? Roger. I've got Lieutenant Kane, sir. Colonel Parkman, Walter. What's UP? We're over Weather Four, sir. The building's been damaged. Looks like the roof's caved in. If there's anyone inside, they could be hurt or worse. I tried to contact them but there was no answer, over. We'll get right on it. Over and out. When did Weather Four report in last? At 0800, sir, right on the button. See if you can contact them again. Alright. Red Eagle One calling Weather Four. Red Eagle One calling Weather Four, come in, Weather Four. No answer, sir. Keep trying. Red Eagle One calling Weather Four, Red Eagle One calling Weather Four. Come in, Weather Four. Operations. Colonel Parkman here. Get my plane ready. Oh, and alert Lieutenant Pizar. Red Eagle One calling Weather Four, Red Eagle One calling Weather Four. Come in, Weather Four. Two men don't just vanish. These did. I don't get it. Everything was under control when they checked in 0800. - Nothing unusual has been reported since then. No storms. - It wasn't a gale that wrecked this shack. Besides, they're caved out as though something crashed into the roof. Well, if it was a plane that hit it Maybe there's a very ordinary explanation for what happened. Maybe the men are on their way back to the base right now. On foot? There would be footprints in the snow. Did you see any? Take a look here. What do you got? I don't know. Plane? No plane ever made that short a run. Helicopter? - No, a helicopter couldn't make a furl like that. I think there is an ordinary explanation to what happened but I wouldn't take any bets. So the only recent contact you had with the weather shack was when the helicopter dropped supplies there five days ago? Yes sir. You checked Weather One? Yes sir. - Weather Four made contact with them at 0813. Everything was jake. I'm picking up something, colonel, but it doesn't make sense. I never saw a blip like that before. It's there, then it's gone. Hey, there it is again. What do you make of it? I'm not taking any chances. Sound the red alert. - Vector 360, climb to angel's three, bogey 90 miles. Red Leader to control. Nothing here. Give us a new vector. Bogey has disappeared. Return to home plate. Charlie. Sugar Pine to Red Eagle One. Come in, Red Eagle One. Sugar Pine to Red Eagle One. Come in, Red Eagle One. Hello Sugar Pine. This is Red Eagle One, go ahead. - Red Eagle One, we're over the wreckage of the C47. They found it, colonel. Get his position. Yes sir. Alert Lieutenant Pizar. Yes sir. Colonel! Looks just like the weather shack. Yeah. Where are they? Where are the bodies? Easy. Look out! What in the world? What is it? I don't know. Looks like it had been broken off of something. That point's as sharp as a needle. I give up, you got me. Well where do we go from here? - We'll have to let CONAD worry about that. This is CONAD. The Continental Air Defense Command at Colorado Springs. The focal point of the supersonic shield that guards the North American continent. A shield that could mean the difference between life and death for millions of Americans. These are hot phones. Using them, it takes only 15 seconds to talk to Alaska. 10 Seconds to alert Newfoundland. Five seconds to contact. Three seconds to reach the Pentagon Command Post. General Ford speaking. . " >. Iii?,. Li?. X I see. Good, I'll take a plane right out. The Arctic Command has delivered the package. Good afternoon, gentlemen. I'm General Ford. Oh no, no, please sit down. Gentlemen, I realize that the air force hasn't given you much time in which to make your tests and that a definitive job may have been out of the question of the short time you've had but the department of defense hopes that during these two clays of concentrated efforts, you've come to some conclusion about this. Professor Gunther, I believe you're in charge. - All of us are agreed to except one thing. This appendage comes from some living creature but as to what creature it was once a part of, we are completely in the dark. Our anatomist, Dr. Arnold Burton, has been unable to identify this object. Professor Harvey Pierce is certain from his exploration that the hook cannot belong to the neurological system. - Well you seem to know more about what it isn't than what it is. That is correct, sir. Gentlemen, let's be logical. Now you tell me that this hook comes from something that's alive, alright, but it wasn't part of the cargo and it wasn't in the plane when it took off so it must have come aboard after the crash, right? That sounds logical. Now what was it that came aboard? It shouldn't be so difficult. You know the animal life of the arctic. We have asked ourselves that, general. You're not suggesting that it comes from some creature at present unknown? - It's a possibility we suggest you investigate, sir. Haw? - We recommend that you ask Dr. Nedrick Jackson of the Museum of Natural History here in Washington to look into this. He is their chief paleontologist and the country's leading authority on the carnivory. You lost me, professor. - He deals with life of past geological periods as shown by the fossil remains of plants and animals. He has been able to reconstruct prehistoric creatures with no more to start with than a handful of bones. Hi Marge. Hi. What have you got there? - A kid in my junior science group made it. Even added an extra vertebra as though it doesn't have enough already. Here, you wanna count 'em? - Listen, if I'm ever to get next month's issue of the magazine out, we'd better start working. I've done a feature. Life Parades Through The Ages. Showing the progression of prehistoric creatures from the jellyfish to the dinosaur to primitive man. Sounds alright. - And I'm going to include the pictures we took on your last field trip. That's even better. Oh, excuse me. Jackson talking. The Pentagon? Sure, I'll wait. What do you know, maybe they wanna call me back into service. This is Dr. Jackson. General Ford. . " >. Iii?,. Li?. X . " >. iii?,. Li?. X I see, general. Of course, sir, I'll be right over. Everything alright? Of course. - Well it isn't every day the Pentagon calls you. You're very nosy. Okay, be mysterious. - Well if I tell you, you'll keep it a secret? Hope to die. - They found an old bone up at the North Pole. The Pentagon wants to know to whom it belongs. It doesn't look like bone. More like gristle or cartilage. A structure as large as this would have to serve a very specialized purpose in order to be cartilaginous. Have you any idea what it comes from? Not the slightest. If it were bone, we could start from that. What it does tell me, however, is that it can't be from an animal because every known species of animal has a bony skeleton. Matter of fact, the reptile structure is bony. Gentlemen, even birds have bony skeletons. Looks like we're getting nowhere fast. - On the contrary, we're making considerable progress. At least we know what it can't be which is bound to lead us to what it is. Well then is there anything that doesn't have a bony skeleton? Lots of things. Worms, snails, insects, shellfish. Some invertebrates wore their skeletons on the outside. Well, it's an outer shell called an exoskeleton which is hard and rigid enough to protect the internal organs. Insects have thin, flexible places between their heads and bodies which allows them freedom of movement. And they have folds where the muscles are attached. It's a possibility. An insect? Yeah, that's where the process of elimination seems to lead us. Of course, if it is an insect, it certainly doesn't tell us what kind it is. We find that out partly from what we know but mostly from what we deduce. - Doc, you're beginning to sound like Sherlock Holmes. Sort of. Professor Gunther, the fluid from the end of the hook, you had it analyzed? We did what we could in the time we had. Of course you didn't know exactly what you were looking for. Precisely. Well I'm not too much of an entomologist but I do seem to remember that with very few exceptions, the blood of insects contains no red corpuscles. Now that we suspect this hook may have come from an insect, would you test the fluid for me and let me know what you get? Be glad to. Thanks. Well general, that's about it. Professor Gunther will make his tests and we'll see what we can dream up. Do you think we'll get somewhere? We'll do our best. - So that's what they wanted to see you about. Don't you play games with me, Ned Jackson. I'm sorry. There's an old saying that you can't keep anything from the press and even if I'm only running a museum mag, I haven't lost my nose for news. That is what it's about. Maybe. I know it is. Maybe not. - Why, it's as plain as the nose on your face. Look, the Pentagon has never consulted you before. The papers say they have a mystery on their hands. One and one still make two so it follows that they must need information in your field. Oh Ned, give me a break. You don't know what it would mean if I could run a story about something that took place in this century. Well I They didn't say it was restricted. You see? Alright, it's like the paper says. There have been crashes and disappearances but the real story is what they found at the last crash. Well it's about five feet long. It's model green in color. Probably broken off a body some place. What are you talking about? It's part of something alive. Something that must be incredibly, unbelievably huge. I think it's from an insect. An insect? Here. Doesn't look very fearsome reduced in size like that, does it? No. No it doesn't. It looks like the spur on the leg of a grasshopper or a cricket. - Grasshoppers and crickets aren't meat eaters and at least five men have disappeared. If that is part of an insect, it's from the biggest creature that ever lived. Are you sure you're feeling alright? There were long skid marks in the snow as if the thing flew in for a landing. Jackson talking. Oh, hello Professor Gunther. You have? I see, sir. Thank you. Well, they just finished the blood tests. There were no red corpuscles. It's from an insect. The ant inside this amber is at least 90 million years old. Now we've been able to learn from pieces of amber like this that certain ancient insect forms have continued without variation until today but others have changed to meet changing conditions and certain species have vanished completely. I just can't believe that an insect as large as you suggest ever existed. Look behind you on the wall, professor. That prehistoric dragonfly measures two feet from wing tip to wing tip and like the modern dragonfly, it too was a flesh eater. - Alright, it's big, but it's only two feet. Is that the best you can do? - I never suggested I was looking for a dragonfly. Then what are you looking for? - To be honest with you, I'm not exactly sure. You're a pathologist, Professor Gunther. The field of pathology is limited but the paleontologist field isn't narrowed to what we understand. On the contrary, we stretch our understanding to try and take in the universe. - Alright, suppose just for the sake of argument that we admit such an insect once existed. How could it be alive today? Exactly. Even the recently discovered prehistoric Siberian mammoths were dead. The natives ate the flesh, used the skin for clothing, made tools from the ivory tusks, but the mammoths were dead. Are you sure they were dead? What? Everyone knows they were. Everyone says they were. Suppose the Siberians hadn't been in such a hurry to slice 'em up for steaks. Suppose they were still alive when found in the ice. Does your learned young friend always go on like this? Alright, professor. You know as well as I do that if living organism is frozen quickly enough, it is theoretically possible to stop the living protoplasm from changing their geometrical patterns which always happens when death occurs. Theoretically, yes. Is it unreasonable then to ask yourself whether the mammoths might have remained alive all those years and it was the Siberians who killed them before they had a chance to thaw out and breathe again? You believe this? Well I don't disbelieve it and I'll go along with it til someone comes up with a better theory. Look, five men have vanished. To die is one thing. To disappear without a trace suggests complete destruction. A flesh eating creature. But there are scores of insects that live on other insects. Where do you start? By thinking of the hook as though it were infinitely smaller. As though it were part of an insect no larger than those we know today. Like, oh, the grasshopper, the beetle, or the cricket. Then ask yourself what flesh eating insect of normal size has such a hook. Ned, you're making a lot of assumptions. Well every paleontologist does. Look, you start with a jaw bone, a couple of teeth, you figure whether they come from a flesh or a grass eater and you go from there. A normal insect that is a flesh eater. I've narrowed the field to one. The diet consists mostly of small insects such as leafhoppers, grasshoppers, caterpillars and others. A substantial part of the diet may also include small frogs and lizards. The female is larger than the male and invariably destroys her mate when he's fulfilled his function in life. Now the hook they found on the plane may very well be a spur from one of its forelegs. If this is it, as large as the monstrous creature we're looking for, I doubt whether anything that ever lived could be as deadly. It's strong beyond anything its size suggests. It walks, leaps, and flies. Its appetite is insatiable. You mean this cute little bug? Yeah, that cute little bug. In all the kingdom of the living, there is no more deadly or voracious creature than the praying mantis. Anything new on the disasters, general? Nothing else, gentlemen. Say, you're Dr. Jackson in the Museum of Natural History, aren't you? That's right. Well what have you been called in for? Dr. Jackson is an old friend of mine. - That's not answering his question, general. You're a paleontologist. Isn't this out of your line? - Have you any theories, Dr. Jackson? Gentlemen, if you were in my position and what you had was a theory, not facts, just a theory, I'm sure you'd withhold it to avoid any speculation that might prove disastrous. I'm sure you realize this and that you'll cooperate with us to avoid panic or hysteria. I know I can count on all of you. Well, good luck to you Ned. Thanks, I'll do my best. Hi. Almost ready? Just let me close this. - I'm told the air force doesn't like to be kept waiting. Here, make yourself useful. Nice of you to see me off. I think so. - You know, the arctic's about the only place where I haven't worked in. Are those mine too? No, doctor, they're mine. Oh. Yours? - Well you couldn't go along without your photographer, could you? ' MY What? Well I phoned General Ford's office and requested permission for you to take your photographer along. I guess he forgot to tell you. Boy, this is really going to be a story. - You'd do almost anything for a story, wouldn't you? Almost. Well come on. Colonel, colonel sir. Dr. Jackson is here from Washington. He's got a, I mean there's a, we- Well speak up. He's with a woman. A female woman. I thought they'd stopped making 'em. Show them in. Yes sir. I'm Ned Jackson, colonel. I'm sure that Washington Excuse me, this is Miss Margery Blaine. Colonel Joe Parkman. General Ford sent me up. I'm magazine editor for the Museum of Natural History. How do you do? That'll be all, men. - It looks like you don't have too many women up here, colonel. - Hey, well, we have a little joke up here. The boys say there's a girl behind every tree. Only try and find a tree. Well when do we see what we came for? I'll have a plane any time you're ready. I'm ready. Fine. These are the skid marks. At least what's left of them. We found the same marks at the weather shack and the Eskimo village. Here colonel. Got it? Eight and a half feet. Let's get back to the plane. At ease. Gentlemen, this is Miss Margery Blaine. I thought you wouldn't mind too much if she had a look around your recreation room. - Oh, she's like a butterfly gliding across a lily pond. Yes, corporal? - With your permission, sir, would it be alright if, would it be alright if I asked Miss Blaine to dance, sir? - Corporal, that decision is entirely up to Miss Blaine. Yes sir. Miss Blaine, would you care to, well, what I mean is, well, I'm not- Yes corporal, I'd love to. Oh hi. Hi. Hi Ned. Thought you were going to join us. I've been busy. You two run along, have fun. What are you up to? - I'm trying to figure out how big this thing is. You know, people used to think that carnivorous plants were defunct. Actually, there are about 450 species of them. Some are almost six feet tall. I'm convinced that we're dealing with a mantis in whose geological world, the smallest insects were as large as man and that failing to find those insects for his food, it's, well, it's doing the best it can. - If there is such a thing, why hasn't anybody seen it? Well those who have are dead. Well who can be sure? It may have been locked in a prison of ice millions of years ago. - What could have released it after all that time? Oh, any sort of unusual vibration. You know how mountain climbers are afraid of thunder? Well, it's because the sound vibration might start an avalanche. Hit the alert button! Yes sir. Operations, Colonel Parkman speaking. Condition red, scramble all air traffic immediately. Condition red! Coffee, colonel? Nine hours and not a whisper. Which is alright with me. - Red Eagle One, this is Hunter Four. Hello Hunter Four, this is Red Eagle One, go ahead. We have nothing here. Request permission to return to base, over. Request denied. Continue search procedure. Over and out. - The only thing to do is to keep the patrols out straight around the clock until we're sure. And remember, I want a report on anything, from Mid-Canada or Pine Tree, anything, you understand? Yes sir. - Got the Mid-Canada radar line on the fence, sir. This is Colonel Parkman. Colonel. Group Captain Hawkins here. This is just a stab in the dark but you chaps asked us to report anything unusual and- ' Yes? As I said, it may not mean a thing but we caught an unidentified object in our scopes. Could have been a storm or a weather balloon. It was a fade signal that came and went but it might be that oversized bug of yours, eh? What time was it? Early. 0400 I should say. Thanks Hawkins. Thanks very much. 0400, that's almost six hours after he left here. Now it's 1500 miles to the Mid-Canada Line. Well, that's no good, he'd have to be doing better than 200 miles an hour. Why not, Joe? We're dealing with an insect. The deer fly does 600 an hour. That's almost as fast as a jet. - The Mid-Canada Line is 1500 miles south of here, right? Right. And where was that Weather Shack Four? - Right there, straight on the 80th meridian. And the C47 crash was here. - That's right, due south of the weather shack. What are you getting at, Ned? And the Eskimo village? - Right there between us and the C47. Hey, wait a minute. He's been going straight south. - And he'll keep going south til he reaches the tropics where he'll find the same kind of climate and jungle vegetation from which he came originally. Now let's see, he'll probably pass over Labrador, Nova Scotia, then he'll hit the gulf stream and I'm sure the warm air above the gulf stream will attract him and he'll follow it all the way down to South America. I've got CONAD on the hotline, colonel. They say it's important. Thanks. This is Colonel Parkman. Are you sure? Thanks. Pine Tree got it too. It went through Newfoundland. Well it looks like we're on our way to Washington. Come on, Marge, grab your toothbrush. All over the United States this morning, some 400,000 members of the civilian ground observer corps are gathered to learn more about this fantastic creature. This program is being presented by the Continental Air Defense Command. Our first speaker is Major General Mark Ford. General Ford. Thank you. I wanna say at the outset that contrary to rumor and certain newspaper headlines, the so-called deadly mantis is no imaginary scare. It's a very real and present danger. With me this morning is Colonel Parkman, commanding officer of an advanced radar interceptor base deep in the arctic circle. Colonel Parkman. Thank you, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, I saw this creature attack our base. I visited a weather shack and I also inspected the wreckage of the aircraft that this thing destroyed. Now we have every reason to believe that the mantis is flying south along the gulf stream and we believe that it will be one of you devoted men and women with the civilian ground observer corps who will spot it next time it appears. I have with me today Dr. Nedrick Jackson, curator of the department of paleontology of the Museum of Natural History. Dr. Jackson has something important to show you. Doctor? Thank you. This object is a spur broken off the foreleg of the mantis when it destroyed the C47. Now the spur of a normal sized mantis is so small, it's difficult to measure. This spur, as you can see, is nearly five feet long which will give you some ideas to the creature's size. Thank you doctor. Now you ground observers are well-trained in the identification of aircraft. Here, to scale, is the deadly mantis and here is the C47 which is destroyed. One other thing. You spotters should listen for a loud droning sound much like that of a squadron of heavy bombers flying in formation. Now the coast guard and the navy have been alerted and they're standing by on the eastern seaboard. If the mantis is sighted, the procedure will be the same as though an enemy aircraft had been spotted. Take no chances. Report any unusual flying object. Thank you. Target is down, target is down. Cannot confirm kill due to low overcast. Returning to carrier, out. Well, here comes another one. Granary fire in Minneapolis. Minneapolis, Minnesota. - There's some power lines down there in Richmond. Richmond, Virginia? Yeah. slide in Fresno. Fresno, Fresno. Oh, I'm so tired. Where is Fresno? California. Fresno, California. Hi. Hi Marge. Hello. - Ned. - Hey, what are you up to? Well it's kind of a private deal. We call it Operation Marge because she dreamed it up. On? - We're charting every unusual occurrence in the country. Some may have been caused by the mantis. It might give us a clue. " Any luck? - Well they're too scattered to mean anything yet. - You kids know what time it is? It's after midnight. Now you're dismissed, both of you. But general, I haven't- No buts about it. You heard what the general said. You're going straight home, young lady. And I'm the guy who's taking you. Night Ned. Goodnight Marge. - We interrupt this program to bring you a news flash. A train wreck has been reported north of Laurel, Maryland on US Highway One. The engine and five cars were overturned in what appears to have been a freak accident. We will bring you further details as they come in. It's only a few miles from here. We'll have a look. - Sorry colonel, there's been a train wreck. You'll have to go back to Warrington Road. Take the detour to your left through Laurel. Is it pretty bad? Could have been a lot worse. How'd it happen? - Probably couldn't see the warning in the fog. Can't tell for sure. The engineer's still unconscious. Joe, do you think it might? No, just an accident. Come on, let's go. Thanks. The light just turned green. - It's too dangerous to drive in fog like this. Remember what happened to that train back there. This is more dangerous. We'd better get going. ' Oh, you forgot your package, lady. Thank you, driver. You know, it's good to get home safely with all the strange things going on around here. - Oh, there's nothing to worry about, ma'am. You just be careful out in that fog. Thank you. - Here is the very latest report. An bus was demolished at the intersection of Morton Avenue and Arlington Road. The cause of the accident which occurred only five minutes ago is still to be explained since there was no other vehicle involved. This accident, in addition to the train wreck which was reported a very short time before, makes a total of seven accidents in this area within the last 24 hours. Take it easy. How about a couple of blankets up here? - What happened? - Whose got any idea, colonel? Something must have lifted the bus and smashed it. The front end's okay so we know it didn't run into anything. You boys might just as well go back. There aren't any bodies. Oh say, take care of this lady for me, will you please? Attention, all military and civil defense personnel. Attention, all police and fire department personnel. The mantis has been sighted over Washington. I repeat, the mantis has been sighted over Washington. Let's go. Excuse me, pardon me. This is a general alert. - Archer, this is Beagle One Seven. Air born with four chickens heading 035, over. It's Colonel Parkman, sir. Eagle One Seven, Archer control. Continue your present heading. Bogey at 12 o'clock, 100 miles. Maintain present air speed, altitude of 5000, over. Bogey tracking 150. I've got Baltimore, general. Go ahead, Baltimore. Second plot 340, range 150. Unidentified object. Speed, 250. Altitude 2000, dropping fast. - Dixie 35 bravo, range 150, speed 250. Altitude now 2000, dropping fast. It's still moving northeast. - You think you'll be able to drive it out to sea? I hope so. Air defense warning red. Stand by to lock on. Baltimore, warning red. Philadelphia, warning red, I repeat, red. Attention Mitchell Field, warning red. Pass to all gun sites. Guns free, fire at any object not identified as friendly. I repeat, pass to all gun sites. Guns free, fire at any object not identified as friendly. Dixie 35 bravo, 342 range, 110. Vector 25, vector 352, range 110. Vector 25, vector, contact lost. Dixie 35 bravo, contact lost. What happened? It dropped below the radar net. Well does that mean you've lost it? - One of the ground observers will pick it up. , this is 19 hotel. Thank you. Mitchell track, bravo gone. 0339, at 25, going northeast. Eagle One Seven, Archer control, vector one niner zero. Bogey at 12 o'clock. Steady on course, 20 miles, over. - That'll put it over Newark in a few minutes. Archer, this is Beagle One Seven. When steady on vector, bogey will be 12 o'clock. Archer control, this is Beagle One Seven. We have splashed mantis. Give me pigeons to home plate. Hey bud, it said on television that the flyer who shot him down is going in the tunnel after him. Did you see it crawl into the tunnel? Hey bud, hey, hey bud. Bud. He'! ' Hey bud, is it still in the tunnel? It ain't out here, mac. Anybody killed? I only know what I read in the papers. Hey smart guy, I thought I told you to stay out of that road block. Now come on, get back there. I'm going home to watch it on TV! Well go ahead home and watch it on TV! Alright, don't push! I can't see anything here! - That's all the smoke we need, shut it off. How much longer do you think it'll take? Oh, we got about a 90% saturation of smoke in the tunnel now. I don't think we can do any better, general. We'll be lucky if we can hold what we've got. - Those wet tarpaulins will hold the smoke alright. Just keep pumping- - Everything's under control on the Jersey side, sir. What about the smoke? It's packed in solid. The tarp's holding it fine. Did you go inside? Yes sir, but we didn't get too close. - How far in do you estimate it to be? - Oh, I'd say about a quarter of a mile from this end. - That puts the mantis below the water line. - I don't think we ought to wait much longer, sir. What do you think, Ned? - No question in my mind that he's mortally wounded. If we can keep him in that tunnel, he'll die. - Is there anything between us and the mantis in this end? - 17 cars according to the automatic counters. Breaks through those tunnel walls, we'll have a flood on our hands. What do you say, general? Go ahead, Joe. Good luck, Joe. Alright men. You've all been told what to do. Now the purpose of that smoke in there is to give us cover. Use it. Now which of you men are carrying the chemical mines? Stay up front with me. And remember, those 3RG mines are effective only in a limited area so watch for my signal before you throw them. Alright men, check masks. Let's go. - There's your cover for next month's magazine, Marge. Go on, take your picture. - Would you mind telling me what's so funny, colonel? Who, me? Nothing at all. Can I help you with the camera? No thanks. - Exactly where did you crash into him, Joe? - Well just about center of the right hand side. If you'll follow me, I'll show you. There, I think you can see right there, sir. The base of the neck. Look out, Marge! I thought you said you killed it. Don't blame Joe. That was an auto-reflex mechanism. It's dead alright. Here, put me down. I said put me down. What's the matter? Don't you like it up here? I've got pictures to take. Well that can wait. - This is no place for romance, Joe Parkman. What about my pictures? Let Ned do it.
