Hot Presents You're already filming. Good. Give me a microphone. I have this one, too, which I want to... Oh, it might get in the way. And here we'll put... We still have to put up screens. Maybe we can hide that ugly thing with a screen. So it looks nice.. So it will look aesthetic. How many people do you think will come? Look, it's on Facebook, "Walla" website had a huge article about me on Friday. And it mentioned it there. -I see. God knows how many people will come. And all the neighbours who remember Arik. He was the sheriff of Basel Street. He'd go out on the balcony in the morning and call out to them. Let's get this over with. I'm exhausted. I'm 80 years old. An old model in... decent condition. Noni? I once told my husband that when I turn 70 I won't be able to climb anymore. I'm 80 now. Bravo. -What do you think? Excellent. -Do you like that key? -Do you like it better? -Yes. I'm not crazy about it. -Neither am I. Then sing it however you like. Don't ask me. I'm very busy now. Shoshik and I... Shoshik, hold the string. -Hold it. They can't hear you Mayor Ron. Oh, I'm supposed to hold it. -You're on this side, Ron. They can't hear me? People always tell me "stop shouting" and now you can't hear me? Will you help us now? One, two, three! There we go. Here's Grandpa Arik's plaque. Kastina Communications and Channel 8 present: A film by Yael Lavie Maybe we should walk in the water? "Why Didn't You Say So" Great! Original Score: Yossi Sidi Editor: Oded Toury Additional Editing: Hila Izhaki Arik, if we had to write a script about Arik Lavie, where would we begin? Isn't there a standard way to begin? We should start with the fact that I was born very very young. At what age were you born? You know, Mom, I was thinking, as open as you and dad were at home, you told Noni and me everything, Still dad never wanted to speak about his childhood. Look, your father had an awful childhood, I call it a deprived childhood. His childhood was taken from him by force. I was born in Erfurt, Germany. When I was two I moved with my family, only my mother, rather, to Morocco since she then married an officer from the Foreign Legion. Do you find this interesting? -Definitely. I remember, as a child, I was very curious about his past which always sounded like a movie to me, and I'd rummage through your letters or photographs... -Yes. And Dad wouldn't cooperate. Let's say I found a letter from his mother, you know what he called her? -He hated her. She gave birth to him when she was 19 and she didn't want him. Why didn't he try to find out who his father was? Did he even know what... -He tried. What did he find out? He knew his father was from Riga and that his last name was Kivmann. He didn't even know his first name. Look... -I don't remember the name Kivmann. Maybe he didn't tell you. Then when I was about 4 we moved to Marseille. It was a very rough year financially, so much so that my mother had to put me in a monastery school. And when my family, which was still in Germany, heard about this, they immediately sent a ticket to send the boy... What a beautiful boy. How could they abandon him? For God's sake. Then I made my first fantastic trip, I remember it very well, I was shipped like a package. What do you mean? They tied a string around my neck with a piece of cardboard attached to it that said: "This is Leo Alexander Inselsbacher," that was my German name. And I that is how I reached Germany, where I began my life with my aunts and uncles. This is Aunt Mina. He called her... He called her Aunt Pee-na. But she did bring him to Israel. Yes, because they pressured her into bringing him. She wanted to put him in an orphanage. Hitler was already in power. And his uncle Robert saved his life by giving her an ultimatum, he said: "If you don't bring him along I'm not coming." -You don't say. "I'm staying here." Here. -This is already in Israel. He's already in Israel here. But she didn't keep him. -No. She got rid of him immidiately. She didn't want him around, he made trouble. So I was sent from youth village to youth village. I was sent from Kfar Baruch to Kfar Yehoshua, from Kfar Yehoshua I was sent to Haifa, from Haifa I was sent to Eilon, from Eilon I was sent to Beit Zera, from Beit Zera I was sent to Yehiam and from Yehiam I ran away to Nahariya. -And that's how you got to know Israel. Where are we driving now? -To Naomi's. I can't wait! My little sweetheart! Funny lady. Arik would be exactly your age. 90. -Exactly, same as me. -This month, in March. We were born in '27. -Exactly. -Right. Naomi, we'll sit... -We're professionals. We'll be... -Facing each other. -Just you and me. -Yes. Just you and me talking about the "Palmach" days. I'm lending you my daughter. Mom, take a walk around the porch. We'll make it quick. Naomi. -Aiwa (Yes). -Great, "aiwa." There's a photo of my dad and you from the '50s, you were in charge of the youth troupe performances. Yes, it was a pleasure to be with him, it was a fantastic group and Arik added so much joy and humour. My dad always said that the Palmach was the first place he felt wanted. In the Palmach, even those who had parents, when they were together they were like brothers and sisters. You felt at home. I totally understand that desire of his since... besides the locals, everyone else threw him out. Nobody wanted him until he joined the Palmach. My dad was illegitimate, you know. -Right. Yes, brilliant. I knew a little bit about it, maybe a side comment by Arik about his mother, maybe he happened to say "that woman," but he never spoke about her. Is the soup burning? It smells like it. -Shoshanna, it's a little spicy. It was missing something so I added pepper, a little too much. That's fine, it helps me breathe. -No, no. It'll help me breathe. -Too bad. It was so delicious. About a month ago I got an email from a fellow named Assi Luria saying that he started an organisation to search for the relatives of Jews from Riga and he read somewhere, on Wikipedia, that Arik Lavie's father was from Riga. I wrote back: "Yes, I don't know his first name "but his last name was Kivmann." A day later he wrote back to me saying that he found him, his name was Zalman Kivmann from Riga. He also sent photos and Dad's grandfather, looks like him. You know, when it comes to certainty We'll never know for sure. Look, I have a feeling it really is him I'd like to think its him and I want to go to Berlin and meet the relatives. I'd be very happy if it turned out to be true. I'd be happy too... -You're a skeptic. Your sister and I are believers. When I was young I wanted to be an actor. I was accepted to the Carmel Troupe and after the Carmel Troupe I had the honor of being accepted to the Cameri Theater's school. I too always wanted to be an actress and when I was 16, I competed in a talent contest and won a prize and a scholarship to the Cameri Theater's school. And there I met the guy I just pushed into the water. How old were you when you met Dad? -17. I was in the "Our Stage" Youth Theater. One day I came looking for Alex Ansky's father, he was the director, At the Cameri Theater which was in Mugrabi Str. then, there were big iron gates and I knocked on the big iron gate and this wild guy with blond curls opened and said: "What are you looking for, little girl?" I said: "I'm looking for Ansky." He said: "There's no Ansky here," pushed me out and shut the gate. That was Dad. -That was Dad. She looked like a doll. She was a perfect doll, well-proportioned with a tiny ponytail, a tiny ponytail, everything was tip-top. But her behavior behind the scenes, she tried hard to toe the line with Arik because Arik was the very symbol of the native Israeli. He was a little crazy and a big hedonist. Always laughing, telling jokes, having fun, full of energy, the perfect Israeli, as much as she was actually the one born in Israel. What are your plans? To invite you to dinner. Arik was wild and she laughed at everything he... Like that, because she really... Yes. -She was madly in love. He went out with other women at the same time, at first. That's right. -Yes. When I came to the Cameri Theater school he had a girlfriend named Chava'le and he flirted with me at the same time. One day he says to me: "I can't decide who to be with." I waited up for him all night and he came back the next morning and said: "It's over between me and her." So I guess I won. Mom, are you excited about meeting the Kivmanns? Very, very excited. -I'm still not convinced we are related... Yaeli still isn't sure they're our relatives. We're convinced. The reason I doubt it... -Yes? is because I'm not sure Dad's father was named Kivmann. It's just a rumour. -No, it isn't. Dad told me so. What's your problem? -A million times. He said "I'm looking for Kivmann." He looked for Kivmann at Beit Hatefutsot, I remember. -Okay. Ok, why is it so important for us to find them? First of all, we're Ashkenazi Jews without relatives. I want more family! I... -No, really. Before I leave this world I'd like to... achieve closure for Dad. He was so miserable... -Dad told me before he died: "I have a hole in my heart, I had no mother." That was his mother's fault. -But I know we found... I'm telling you, this Zalman Kivmann was his father. I remember him telling me: "I wonder where I got my musicality. It can't be from Aunt Mina." Really. I feel like he's with us. -He's with us. I just spoke to him. I said: "Look what I'm doing, "dragging suitcases, all for your sake." -An 82-year-old woman... To joy and love. -Joy and love. -Joy and love. Like it or not, when you take a train in Germany you always wonder what Jews saw from... Always. -When they were sent to Poland. When Dad looked for Kivmanns in Yad VaShem he didn't think they survived. You know Dad, he never did a proper search for him. If it didn't happen right away... Right. He went to Yad VaShem, didn't find them, and that was that. Dad was ambivalent, he said: "I want to know but I don't want to know." And I irrationally feel in my heart that they are our family and rationally choose to believe that they are. Look, I believe there's a possibility... -Yes. And I have to make that hard decision because it's unlike me to take that leap of faith. So don't be a journalist, be a human being. Why not? Why not? Adopt them. "From the Four Corners of the Earth", "Ariye Lavie played a lovable half-wit" (critic review) "Tartuffe", 1950 "Ariye Lavie must improve his accent to meet theater demands" (critic review) When I came to the Cameri Theater they told me: "Look, you're very talented "but your diction is awful. "Why don't you work on it?" In 1950 I ran around... That's how I met him, in the halls of the Cameri Theater. "To be or not to be." "The Mischiefs of Nasser a-Din", 1953 "Queen Sheba", 1951 "Ariye Lavie learns the secret to silence enfolding the novice actor" (critic review) "The Castle", 1955 "As You Like It", 1955 "Ariye Lavie has certainly improved both his acting and his accent" (critic review) He didn't like theater. For the first 20 performances it's still exciting, after that it's grueling work. Because even as a singer, he liked to improvise. 20 years ago I had the honour of performing with a trio called The Three Strings. "The Three Strings" reunion, 1977 The three bass voices singing together, it was an incredible band. They were revolutionary. When he sang: "Wake up, cowboy, go in, go in, go in, cattle..." it was like a new prophecy. "He Walked Through the Fields", 1958 They performed in the play "He Walked Through the Fields." A promoter saw them and she decided to take them to Paris. We didn't know what would become of me... Weren't you worried he'd leave you? -After three years... Yes, I was worried but I didn't say anything. I figured, "Okay, he's going. What can I do?" Three weeks before he left there was a party until 3 a.m. and he walked me home from the party. I was living with my mother. He drank that night, too. -Yes, he was tipsy, jolly, and he was getting loud so my mother opened the second-floor window and said: "Instead of screaming down there "come upstairs, you're waking the neighbours." -Right. We went upstairs and he said to my mother: "You know I'm going away and maybe we should get married "but your daughter shouldn't marry me, I'm not normal, I'm a little crazy." And my mother went along with him and said: "Okay, then don't get married." The next morning he woke up, my mother made us breakfast, he said to me: "Let's go to the rabbinate," and that was our wedding. I went to visit him in France and we spent about a year and a half in France. "The Arava Trio at the Olympia buffet pre performing with Charles Aznavour, 1957" I'm joining you in line. -Go ahead. What's going on here? -Go back to your place. You can't cut into line. Don't push me like that. Don't go here. -It doesn't... Yeah, yeah. Unpleasant man. -Mom, you can't cut in line, they saw us here without you. Here, take my hardboiled egg, okay? Forget about him, take my egg. Did you see the push he gave me? Yes. -What a push! I've never seen such a thing. Now I understand. I froze. He really hit me. Say: "Excuse me, ma'am, there's a line here." What the...? There you are. -This place has the flare of a death camp. Doesn't it? What would Dad say? "Deutschland, Deutschland uber alles." -He'd beat up the guy who hit Mom. He'd beat him up. You were his mother in many ways. Could be. I guess there was something motherly about me although I had children late in life, but maybe he was like a child to me which is why I didn't get pregnant for ten years. I'd come back from France and I didn't want to go back to the Cameri Theater. Then I heard of the "Theatre Club". The Theatre Club was considered... All the Bohemians, all the elite... There was nothing like it at the time. That's where the Dudaim started out, and Rika Zarai, and I remember Arik standing by the piano, singing. Alexander Penn used to come to the Theater Club and have a shot of good cognac with us, and once he said to me: "I have a song that I think you can sing." And then we did "Did It Ever Happen." You'd always see Shoshik and Arik at Kassit. You'd meet them every night on Dizengoff Street. They'd go to the California Bar. and Arik would get tipsy and Shoshik would yell at him. They were funny. They fought a lot. But somehow she always won. He was a wild man, a child. True, he was older than me, but he was even more childish than me and I'm pretty childish. At first you didn't have children because you didn't want to. That's right. -Why not? -I was terrified of labour. It was actually the fear of pain, of pregnancy and giving birth. It may have also been a certain instability in our marriage. There were all sorts of temptations that Dad couldn't resist and Yes, we were also busy building our careers. - "He and She", 1963 - Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Israel! Shoshanna Lavie and Arik Lavie in "He and She"! Written and directed by Ephraim Kishon. Dad said we forced Kishon to write. For nine months we created, kneaded and made "He and She." It was a tremendous success. Insane. "He and She" 100 performances of "He and She" at the Intimate Theater. It took the country by storm. I now call it big cabaret, two people performing on a big stage and they fill the stage. There'd been nothing like it. I remember sitting in the theater and getting knocked out every time. "This week they celebrated their 6-year anniversary" I want to tell you, dear, I saw a girl at the supermarket, a pretty little thing. If you're willing, we could take her home and the three of us could live in harmony like two doves. "He and She", 1963 Dad fell in love with another woman... -How did you find out? Someone told me. I remember as if it were yesterday. I was at home one Friday afternoon.xk She phones me and tells me. "Shoshik, I have something to tell you?" She says: "Arik is cheating on you." Just like that. I was devastated. I followed him and one night I knocked on the door... in the middle of the night and shouted his name and no one came out, but the woman's neughbour yelled at me: "Go away, you nut! "We'll call the police!" -And he was there? What did he say afterwards? He denied everything. "It's our fault!" And everything... fell to pieces. "It's our fault! We betrayed!" "He and She broke up" "We're sorry to hear about the marriage crisis of our beloved singer Arik Lavie, "and his wife Shoshanna Shani, the young, talented comedic actress." It was an atomic bomb. Everyone talked about it. Everyone. Not only that, we knew... -The other woman. She was nothing like Shoshik. -How was she different from my mother? She was a bit distant, the stardust didn't impress her, and I guess that's what attracted him. I didn't tell you when Dad decided to leave home. That's important. -Go ahead. My father had passed away. At the Shivah of my father He told me he was moving out. I remember Shoshik was crushed, but I remember... that she fought to go on living anyway. To go out, it was a sort of revenge. She drank and partied. -She drank and partied? -Yes. Oh my God! -Josie, sweetheart! -Hello, hello! Josie lived here with Shmulik for years. -Right. And we came over all the time. Arik and Shoshik were... a safe place, and Shoshik was like a mother to me, a sister. I'd come crying to her and... she helped me, my first telephone was to Shoshik. At a certain point Mom and Dad broke up. -I remember it very well. Because then she came crying to me. I came over every night. -Yes. Every night, it was like my family home, I'd show up every night. We'd go out to Frederica's... -That's right, to party... To Frederica's. -Until the morning light. Or to Rafi's. -Right. "Rumpelstiltskin", 1965 For me it was my most successful year. -As an actress. I acted in "Hamlet" and "Rumpelstiltskin" and I was in the film "Aliza Mizrahi" and another production. Hold on, you must mean only the men among us. Why is that, Miss Tsipora? Some women are strong enough to stab a man to death. I hope nobody suspects me... How do you work with someone you're about to divorce? Believe me... -Wasn't it terribly hard? The whole thing was a haze. I weighed maybe 75 lbs., I was emaciated. You eventually decided to run away. Why? Because he asked me for a divorce and I refused him. Somewhere in the back of my mind I always believed I could win him back. So I decided to run away to London. I had lots of friends in London, The High Windows, Josie, the love of my life, Arik Einstein, Shmulik. They had a major recording contract. How long were you in London? -Eight months. What did Dad do? Where was he? I don't know, I was there and he was here. With the other woman? -Yes. He was on fire, he was always burning with this fire. He had this constant inner flame... and he never slowed down! "Singing in Tzavta", 1977 Every performance felt like a premiere. He loved to perform, he needed it. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that's what getting old is like. Its hard to plug along.. It ain't like it used to be. Generations come and go and the young get hitched up and pull... Then some strong diesel says to the engine: Listen... So move, move, move... Oy vey... Oy vey... So Berman closed the spigot The fire went out and the steam ran out And Berman told the manager: "There he is, take him away, take him away "He's all used up..." "Arik Lavie: Heart attack due to trombosis" One day I get a telegram: "Come home, Arik is in the hospital, he had a heart attack. "He wants you to be in Israel." Because he said, in these very words: "If this happened to you, Shoshik, "even if I were in Kamchatka I would come." All my friends, the High Windows, said I was crazy. I had no reason to go back. He was still with the other woman. I remember it as if it were yesterday. -Why? Because she was confused. She didn't know what to do. -Whether to go back. To go back or not. The other woman stayed with him in the hospital the whole time so Shoshik thought: I'll go, she'll be on one side, I'll be on the other? Not that I hadn't been in that situation... But I went back. I spoke to her on the phone. -To the other woman. To the other woman, and we decided when I'd be there and when she'd be there so we wouldn't meet there and make the patient angry or whatever, make him upset. I have to say, I'd never do such a thing. I don't know many people who could. I don't know where I found the strength. I took care of him and made him a program and he had a special diet... walks along the beach and so on, and one day he found that he missed the other woman so he started to go to her every night and I went to my friends. When he was with her. -Yes. He started saying he might want to go back to her. Then she told him: "I don't know, "you're sick, and after all, she was your wife for ten years, "she should take care of you." -After that, and times were different then... -Yaeli, there's only one explanation. That we had, or I did, a love, a huge love. There was no love like it. It was my destiny. When he was told he had a baby daughter, he went out and shouted to high heaven. He shouted for joy. Yes or no, yes or no A thousand and one songs, Noa... He didn't believe he would be a father and he didn't believe he'd love fatherhood so much. We spoke about it a few times, he was enraptured with the fact that you exist and that you were his. It was the first time he had something of his own, you were his first family. He even said: "I don't need them to get married, "I don't want grandchildren, I want them near me forever." And the fact is, you had no serious relationships as long as he was alive and he never got to see any of his four grandchildren. Look, all sorts of cocktails. I have to check them out. Let's have a cocktail. -Yes, let's. What's in it? No carbs. You know the story, Yaeli, when they were breaking up they were both in "Rumpelstiltskin" and Mom didn't wake up for the children's matinee because she got drunk every night and he came... -You're making me out to be... No, I'm not saying you're an alcoholic, this was then. Then, yes, I drowned my sorrows in wine. -In the bitter drop. Yaeli, would you tell your kids: "Dad and I broke up, Dad cheated on me"? I remember it from when I was 6, it's unreal. It's a bad, wrong thing to do. -Think of your children. I'm very sorry, in retrospect. -Yes. That explains why you romanticised it, you were raised on... It's no fairytale, we shouldn't have heard it at that age. It was a mistake. -Yes, it was a mistake... To let you in on such an awful thing at that age. -For real. It was totally inappropriate. -Totally. We were actors and extroverts. -Right. -We were your audience, too. Exactly! -Not only that, we asked to hear the story so they tried to please us. -Right. Extroverts, and we made a joke and an act of it. -Right. And listen to this, just before he died he was in my kitchen, you know he liked to sit in the rocking chair, and he said: "Shoshik, I want to tell you something." I said: "What?" He was really sick by then. -Right. He said: "I want to apologize..." -Right. "For everything I did to you throughout our life together," and I said: "Look, Arik, I'm not totally innocent either, "I also apologize if I wasn't..." It was a mutual apology and it was important. -When he was in the hospital in a wheelchair, we sat outside in the sun and he didn't say a thing, then he looked at me and said: "I made your mother's life hell." -Yes. Erfurt Train Station, Erfurt HBF... Hold on. Why do you think we didn't marry until Dad died? I'm sure if we were sitting on a psychologist's couch he would tell us that neither of us had a serious relationship until Dad died because he was the man in our lives. -Yeah. But it's a very banal thing to say. Maybe you were looking for something like Mom and Dad had, a great, romantic relationship, but... I wasn't really interested, I didn't feel like I needed it. Don't make a face. -You know what Dad once said about you? That I'm dying to get married. -Yes. But it's so not true. -Then why did he say that? I don't know, maybe that's what he thought, but not everything he thought was etched in stone. -Right. Oh, here's "go to payment." But I can tell you as a mother that it would never occur to me to tell 4 and 6-year-old children about Dad's affairs before I was born because it's very upsetting, and maybe we weren't in relationships for many years because we were afraid of marriage, maybe we were afraid of marriage. Maybe we thought we'd get hurt. "Oh, Juliet", 1977 Is your crazy daughter asleep? -I think so. She came crawling home drunk at 3 a.m. Was she alone? No way of knowing. She's underneath the bed, the hussy. Ten years after "He and She" we created "Oh, Juliet" with Ephraim Kishon. "Kishon weds Romeo and Juliet" "Oh, oh, 250 shows!" Then they performed "Oh, Juliet" in Germany. It's a comedy, Romeo and Juliet never died, Romeo and Juliet are still alive. The hall was full of Germans and we decided I'd watch from the stage. Arik said: "Don't sit with those Nazis." That's how he talked. I'm sitting on stage throughout the performance and every time, just before Arik went on stage, he said: "Fuck the Nazis," then went on stage and played old Romeo. But every time he finished a scene he said: "The Nazis laughed, didn't they? We screwed the Nazis!" Arik Lavie and Shoshanna, Shoshi. -Shoshanna. Two actors from Israel. You've been here for three years, that's a long time. And they want them in Austria and in Switzerland, it's a massive hit, and Arik says: "I want to go home" and Shoshik says: "No, we have an offer to tour Germany, "in Berlin and Hamburg..." And Germany never ends, you can easily perform for 5 or 6 years... -7. That's how we made a living. Our whole lives we were supported by "He and She" and "Oh, Juliet." That's what put food on the table. I can't believe it! Shoshik! -Ladies first. Sweetheart. -I love you. We haven't seen each other in 23 years. We'll talk later, I have something to tell you, Arik always said he didn't have a father and he was an illegitimate child. -Yes, yes. But he did have a father, his name was Kivmann. In Berlin we're going to meet Arik's cousin's wife, he died in the meantime, it's incredible. Incredible. In my memory you're still wearing costumes. For ten years we came to Germany every year. -Yes, yes. Arik, when is Hanukah? In December. December, December. But Arik loved you. Yes, Arik fascinated me from the first day we met. It was like symbiosis, like two brothers. You had endless conversations. -Yes, always. I remember you walking with your dog, Korbus, philosophizing. Korbus! Korvos! Korvos! Korbus! My voice is coming back gradually. I have to sing tomorrow, I have a gig, a crappy little gig, but I have to make money. Why? Because. Shoshik and I made a movie. We were paid $10.000. The movie was lousy, the producer was lousy, the script was lousy, but the money was good and in the papers they wrote: "How could Shoshanna Shani and Arik Lavie do such a thing?" It's no good, but it's my job, I make movies. I'm an actor. Sometimes they're good, sometimes they're bad. The problem is, I have to make a living and support the family and that creates stress. Taken from "The Engine", 2003 Director: Assaf Chemetz Dad didn't do anything. All the paperwork, all the things that men do at home, no! Dad liked three things: sleeping, drinking coffee and singing. I rack my brains, I don't know what to do... Until Shoshik stepped in getting paid as a musician was a mess, he wouldn't pay for 5, 6, 10 shows and then Arik would pull out a wad of cash and go: "Here," totally out of proportion to my work. Then Shoshik put things in order. When he went out in the morning he'd say: "Give me ten shekels, "I'm going out for coffee." He didn't carry money on him. -I know. -He didn't get it. That's why we went broke after the first Gulf War and we had to sell our apartment. "The wine festival in Rishon LeZion, 1989" There was a point when he started getting little gigs. Shows all over Israel, 20 to 40 shows a month, that's hard work. He'd tell me: "Wherever they want me, Tiberias, Lake Kinneret, take it." Congratulations on your new settlement, I wish you success. I already have the shirt, now I just need land and a house. He'd perform anywhere, even on a toilet seat, he just wanted to perform. All the rivers go to the sea... People would phone and say: "We want you for this and this..." "You got it!" He didn't know where, why, when, how much they'd pay... "You got it." There were times when I felt like I was playing with a painter or a photographer, we were playing... - Yossi Sidi - "Rest comes to the weary." When I closed my eyes I felt like I was in the valley and I could see the horses, it's hard to explain. He was the jazziest musician I ever met. He liked to change keys, tempos... Ballads, you know, one, two... he'd signal us behind him and go... He wanted to play it fast, one, two, one, two, three, four... and we'd play and improvise and go wild. It wasn't a bad show, it was definitely professional. You know they handed out food in the middle? I once saw him drunk, he forced the taxi to drive, this was in Haifa, to the home of his adoptive parents who didn't live there anymore, and he shouted. And pissed on the house. We're driving back from Haifa Bay and he tells the driver: "Go up this way. Drive this way." He stops him and says: "See? "This is the house I lived in when I first got to Israel, "now everybody spit on it." We laughed, we said, "What...?" He said: "Spit!" I was shocked. He said: "You have no idea how bad it was." Why is she running? Mom, Mom, Mom! Get over here. How long will the train stop for? -Long enough. Most of the times it came up I was called an orphan because I didn't bother telling I had a mother somewhere in Morocco. By the way, my mother did not see me for 24 years. She put a 7-year-old boy on a train, alone, with a sign saying: "I am Leo Alexander Inselsbacher..." Across from him a boy sat eating a roll and he wanted some... She didn't give him food for the road. -No. It's heartbreaking, even now. It's as if you will put Shahar or you put Lia on a train, alone, it's unthinkable. And he travelled from one country to another. It was either stupidity or cruelty on her part. He said she'd undress him when she went out to work as a waitress because he'd try to go out to play with the neighbourhood kids so she'd lock him in the house naked and he said she hit him with... the blunt side of the knife, over the head. Apparently she couldn't control herself. Poor little guy. In '54 I shot a movie called "Hill 24 Doesn't Answer" and suddenly I had 2.000 liras so my uncle suggested: "Go to Marseille and meet your mother." I could just hear the music like in the movies and picture myself meeting my mother and all the years apart would just vanish and we'd be together again, mother and son. I spent two weeks in a hotel with her and I had nothing to say to her and... everything I'd imagined, that it would burst out, this thing that had died and was stifled within me because of my childhood apart from her... Far from it. She was a stranger to me. I always felt like he hated his mother. He had a score to settle with women. It was hard for him to deal with. He wasn't faithful to women. C'mon, you're exaggerating. In a sense... -He didn't trust women. He abandoned women. -You know what I mean? As much as you loved him, he didn't trust you. Remember, at the hospital he said: "As soon as I die she'll find someone else." And you said: "Arik, are you crazy?" He had constant separation anxiety. -Right. That's why he was always looking for more women. The separation anxiety never left him. It never left him. "Taken from 'Live with Dan Shilon', 1998" What does pouring out the coffee do? I don't know about the future, but the coffee's excellent. As far as your health, you have a lot of internal stress, you're very agitated. And... His heart was in very bad shape when he died. But he was a cardiac patient from an early age, he had his first heart attack when he was 42. Lavie, get a grip. All my life, until his death, I'd wake up in the middle of the night and listen to make sure he was breathing. All I remember from our childhood is... that Dad was sick, he was sick several times, but he was more afraid of people finding out than he was of the heart attacks. -He was a macho man. He didn't want people to know. It bothered me that he kept singing after open heart surgery. I kept asking him to stop but he refused. Because he loved singing. It was the love that was denied of him as a child. That he was wanted, and I couldn't take that from him. The voice of Israel, the greatest singer of all time, Leo Alexander Anzelzatlsbacher, otherwise known as Arik Lavie! I remembered the name, Anzaltz... You say it. Inselsbacher! He was very, very sick. All the rivers flow to the sea And I have nowhere left to go... He sat in front of the TV and watched himself perform and said: "Everything comes to an end." The next morning he felt very ill. He didn't want an ambulance. He refused to call an ambulance. It was pouring outside, and I called a cab and the driver said: "Oh, Arik Lavie, "I saw you on TV just last night. "Why are you going to the hospital?" And that was that. He never left the hospital. You know what I dreamt last night? I just remembered. We weren't with him when he died because we went home to shower and they phoned us and said: "It's happening." For a whole week we knew he was at death's door. I was ironing the garment I'd wear to the funeral and they phoned and said: "Come back, this is it." What I dreamt last night has to do with something that I haven't dealt with... That we weren't there? -Yes, because Dad told me... A month before he died he had heart failure in the hospital one night and we came to Intensive Care at 2 a.m. and he was so sweet, he said: "I asked them to call you because if I'm dying I want you with me." And my dream last night had to do with that, that we had to get there. To be with him when he... -And I kept saying, "Okay, "it'll happen in 15 minutes, it'll happen in 10 minutes, "but I'll get there." And then I woke up. It's well known that the dying person knows he's dying and he doesn't want to hurt his dear ones. He couldn't die if we were with him. It would've dragged it out and we did him a kindness, letting him leave the world. That day Mom sat next to him and whispered: "I'm letting you go." I didn't, I said: "Daddy, please stay." Dad was born here, for God's sake. Imagine Edith driving here, going to give birth to Dad. -Right. My late husband was born here in 1927. As if he cares. But where was the entrance? I read on the internet that they preserved the hospital entrance. Here, this was the entrance. And here's Edith going up the stairs carrying Dad. I'm going to give birth to Dad. For God's sake... She went in. No, listen, this is weird for me. Unbelievable. March 9th, 1927. I'm not moved. -I am. It's a building, it's where he was born, but my memory of him doesn't connect. When I think that 90 years ago Edith went in and gave birth to Dad and we're standing here now, I think that's wonderful. -Definitely. But I don't feel anything toward this building, toward these stones. It's not the building, it's the fact that Dad was born here. -Fine. It's weird to visit people you don't even know. We won't hug and kiss them, we don't know them. I'm sure Yevgenia will hug us. We'll start easy, no big shows of emotion, maybe when we leave we'll hug. I'm easy. -Who's Yevgenia again? Yevgenia is Dmitri's wife, he was Aaron's son and Aaron was Dad's uncle. -Zalman was Aaron's brother. And Aaron was the father of Yevgenia's husband. Here, Kivmann. Hi! Wow, this is exciting! -She has blue eyes like the rest of them. Welcome, with all my heart. Thank you, I'm so happy. -I'm even happier. I'm already tearing. I saw the movie "My Way," I found it on the internet. It had a picture of your husband as a boy. -Yes. And he looks just like my husband. -Yes. I prepared all the photos, I'll show you. Oh, this is for the soup. Nice. He looks like Dad. -Just like him. -Yeah. Do you realize this is your family, Yaeli? Are you less skeptical now? The color of his eyes... -Yes, it's the same as yours. Dad's, mine, that's what I'm looking at. I also have... -You have the same eye colour, so did my husband. My father's eyes were the same color. It's incredible. -Yes. Aaron was your father's father? -Yes, but we only found out a few years ago that there was another brother, Zalman, because he died young. Aaron, my grandfather, also died very young. They all died of heart disease? -Yes, my father, too. Aaron was a jazz musician, right? My husband loved jazz more than anything. My father loved music but he had no talent as a singer. Oh, he couldn't sing. This is Aaron. -Wow. -Aaron was handsome. Yes, he loved the women. Their father was also a womaniser. You know what it means? But one question still remains, was Zalman your father's father? We know we're related to Zalman, but we don't know if he was related to your father. What are they saying? -Exactly what I'm saying. We can find out. -I don't understand. We can find out. -You mean a DNA test? DNA. -DNA. I have a strong feeling you're related. -I feel it in my heart. He looks like the Kivmanns here. Look, this is their father, his cousin. There's a resemblance. He kind of looks like my Shahar. -Right. Look at the eyes, Yaeli. They're all musicians. Look, this is like Dad at a gig. Too bad they never met. He had such a hard life. It's a real shame. If only they knew. But now we've reestablished contact. At least our children have met, that's nice. -Yes, it's a great joy. Yes, it's a great joy. That was very wonderful. And see how many hours we spent there. -Lots. -Since 13:00. Since 13:00. -Wow, 6 hours. We took up their entire day. We pulled an "ich bin du" on them. You know what an "ich bin du" is? -Yes. Its guest who stays over 5 hours. It's a bad guest. For the first two years it wasn't easy, let's put it that way, I cried and so on, then I realized that was no way to live if I'm to keep going, because when we leave this world, isn't up to us and I don't want to get sick or fall or be a burden on anyone. I don't like other people's help, as you know. Morning. Do you have butter croissants? Yes. -Where? I'll have two. Good morning, Arik. I dream of him a lot. -What do you dream about? Our break up, that he didn't die and he knocks at my door and says "I'm back." "I'm back"? -He comes back in your dream? Yes. -And you take him back? Of course. -Like you always did. I loved him madly, truly madly. He was my whole life. Subtitles: Trans Titles Ltd.
