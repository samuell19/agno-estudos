It's minus 10 degrees. It's freezing. What's that woman up to? How did she climb up? I have no idea. Darkness will return, and the Hell King will break out. This is a secret base. Outsiders are barred from entering. Get someone to bring her down right away. Kill her if necessary! The Hell King will break out, and darkness will return. The Hell King will break out, and darkness will return. Run... Ashura, the Hell Virgin! Give me the gun! Man has destroyed nature. The devil holes that dominate the darkness and lead to hell will open one after another. Ashura, we're the true masters of mankind. Remember these two! They're the sons of Yang. We must get rid of them!

Peacock, where have you been catching demons lately? You'll be impressed when I tell you. There were vampires in Xi'an, and I wiped them out. I heard those were not vampires but thieves who were eyeing the terracotta sculptures. You were catching thieves, not demons. Master, I noticed there's been a spate of natural disasters lately. A forest fire broke out in China, and there were floods in Bangladesh. These are signs that evil is stirring. This is why I've asked you to come back. It's heavy. This probably weighs a catty. Darkness will augur ill for mankind. This is the golden figurine of the body possessed by the Hell Virgin, Ashura. Go and find her. Sure, leave this honorable mission to me. How can I find her? Based on my prediction, the second devil hole is in Tokyo. You've been my disciple since you were young. So do you know what your mission is? Chanting and reading sutras is only good during peaceful days. But if evil wreaks havoc, we must step up and wipe it out for the good of mankind. I read the stars and study the calendars and have come to realize that doomsday has arrived. So I'm sending you to get rid of evil. Since ancient times, good and evil, Yin and Yang, have coexisted between heaven and earth. The gods and the devils kept fighting each other. Finally, the God of Justice defeated and imprisoned the Hell King, the governor of pain and darkness. Unfortunately, man's depravity has undermined the forces of justice, and the Hell King is now ready to resurrect and return to the world. Can't we stop him? Once the four devil holes leading to the Gates of Hell open, man will be ruled by darkness. The one who opens the devil holes for the Hell King is Witch Raga. You must stop her. Master, what should I do? Go to Tokyo. Is that where the devil hole is? Yes. Since it's my duty to rid the world of devils, I'll do my best. Your first contact point in Tokyo is the Odakyu Department Store. -We still need a spotlight. -Okay. Tomorrow's the opening. Be careful. Don't break the dinosaur model. I heard a celebrity will attend the ribbon-cutting ceremony. Did they invite Jackie Chan? Really? That would be great. He's my idol. Everyone, thanks for your help. -I'll buy you guys supper after work. -Thank you... This model is scary. We should barbecue it. Let's go for barbecued dinosaur chops. Anything will do. -Tie the rope tighter! -Okay. What's going on? It's a power failure. -What's going on? -What's happening? Get someone to check it out. -The fuse may have blown. -It can't be. -Why is there a power outage? -Right... Let's check it out. How is it? Has the fuse blown? It's so dark. I can't see anything. Be careful not to break this. What's going on? How is it, Danny? There's no problem with the power supply. That's strange. All right, the lights are back. It's fine now. The breaker tripped. Let's get back to work. Yu Mo-Lin, why do you look so scared? The dinosaur... The dinosaur has a human head in its mouth! -The dinosaur is having supper too? -I'm not joking. Look at that big mouth! It looks like it wants to swallow me whole. You must be too tired. Danny, please take her to get some rest. A hamburger? Master says you're very powerful, but you're just little imps acting up. Fine. I'll get the dog to play with you. Does it taste good? "DINOSAUR EXHIBITION" Look. A monk. Yes, but he's not bald. -What's he doing here? -Buying a comb. "MARKETING DIRECTOR'S ROOM" -Another feng shui master? -He's an exorcist. Master, money's not an issue. Last time, I paid more than HKD 100,000 to select an auspicious opening date. Now, I just want to get rid of everything evil. I'm not here for money. My master ordered me to come. Good, I'll save the money, then! Master Lucky Fruit, why is your name so old-fashioned? At least it's better than Buddhist Fruit. My master gave me the name. That's nonsense. I've come across enough liars. Ms. Okada! He's doing it for free. Show some respect. There are things even science can't explain. I'm sorry. Excuse us. She's an ignorant girl. Please don't take it to heart. People don't usually believe in the supernatural. Has there been a mysterious death in your company lately? Mysterious death? Even if there had been, we'd keep it secret. Any rumors that are unfavorable to our business will be covered up. Enough of your business. What we're facing now is a crucial fight between the gods and the devils. We have to strike first... in this duel between good and evil. Such nonsense! Manager, I can't understand what he's saying. I've had enough. So excuse me. -Ms. Okada-- -Do you think he's Mr. Vampire? Or One-Eyebrow Priest? You can tell that to Sammo Hung and Jackie Chan. I'm busy. I have no time for you. You'll be in trouble if you don't listen. Yes, I'm aware. I'll be in serious trouble if I don't finish my work. What are you staring at? Stand there and don't move. This is a lecher ghost. It loves women and the perfume on them. If you can see it with your naked eyes, it means it has grown to a very dangerous level. From what I see, something's going to happen tonight. I won't be taken in by those tricks of yours. I've got no time to fool around with you guys. Ms. Okada. Tomorrow's the opening day. Now is not the time for rituals. Unless the demons are subdued, the dinosaur exhibition can't proceed tomorrow. How much longer will this take? Until dawn at the earliest. Mr. Lucky Fruit, you can stay here and chant until dawn. You cannot leave. You'll be in danger. It's hot and stuffy here. Staying with you overnight is the real danger. Okada, don't you need to stay behind to perform the rites? Unless it's for mah-jongg, I'm not staying. What about Manager? He's probably dozing off. You found something? Is the dressing room over there? Yes. Evil is in the north-east. It's the devil hole. Oh, no! What now? Hurry up. You lecherous monk! -Get out. -Okada, don't open the wardrobe. Why? ls there a demon in there? Crazy! Rid! Run! Save me! I believe you now... Get off me. I can't do the rites. Who are you? I'm Peacock, a busybody. Oh, no! What about my exhibition? What about my dinosaur? If I'm not mistaken, this exhibition venue must be where the devil hole in Tokyo is. It seems we're on the same trail. Right. So you're from the same sect. We have the common goal of eradicating evil, but we have nothing to do with each other. Okay, I'll charge a nominal fee. Don't listen to this Chinese's babbling. Now that the second devil hole has opened... the Hell Agent will be here soon. If you can settle this, I'll pay any sum you want. Fine. In that case, you must answer my questions honestly. Sure. Go ahead and ask. This department store was formerly a funeral home. You got it cheap through illegal means. No wonder the staff kept seeing ghosts. I'm an expert at catching ghosts. Don't brag. These ghosts are very vicious. I'm the only one who can handle them. What's that noise? Wow, there's stereo sound. Stop joking. Without the dinosaur, they will show their original forms soon. Things are going to get exciting. Don't worry. Let's get to a safe place first. Hell?"... Manager! -Leave him. Just go and hide. -Manager... How ugly! What ghost is it? It's a stray ghost from the old funeral home. Do something. Fighting warriors, show your power... Rid! What? That's it? I haven't even made a move. How uneventful. Actually, we destroyed their souls to help them reincarnate. Good... Too bad we couldn't save this manager. Do you have to chant for this as well? You're so troublesome. Don't you have any sympathy? How dare you lecture me? I'm a Mikkyo monk too. I know how to perform rites as well. Wait till you see my moves. You're not Japanese. How can you be a disciple of Mikkyo? Mikkyo originates from Tibet in China. Fine! I'll show you my kung fu. I hate cocky men. Come on. Stop it, you two! Aren't both of you monks? MY finger... Peacock, now that the exhibition has been called off, let's drink to my unemployment! Cheers. You too, Lucky Fruit. Cheers! I lost my job, but I kept my life. I'm a believer now. Now I know why so many people learn Chinese astrology and believe in divination. Since we're friends, I'll tell you the truth. My master sent me here from Tibet not just to exorcise ghosts. Were you given an important mission? Okay. I'll tell you. This golden doll is linked to my mission. Have you seen it? An Oscar? Of course not. Where did you steal this from? You take me for a thief? Her name is Ashura. She has infinite power. She's actually the Hell King's daughter. The Hell King's daughter? The relationship between the Hell King, the Hell Agent, and the Hell Virgin is like that of the Holy Trinity. So what does that mean? It means the end of the world! So I must stop it. Have you got the power? Forget it... With your limited IQ, you can help by just staying away. Lucky Fruit, dance with me. Sorry, a monk can't dance. Don't worry. Nobody knows you're a monk. A country bumpkin wouldn't go to a disco to dance. Let me dance with you instead. Ashura. That's the two of them. I didn't expect you to dance so well. -You must be the most dissolute monk. -Really? -Cheers. -Cheers. Peacock, look at her! Ashura? She doesn't look like a demon. Where? Who? You found her? Raga“. -Where is she? -She's here. I can feel that she's around. She got away. Forget it. What now? Don't you have a move which predicts more accurately than the observatory? The position is Shen. She's heading towards the east to the Pacific Ocean at 500 knots and will land on a mysterious island. Are you sure? What island is that? Hainan Island or "Nonsense Island"? This island is full of splendor. I see. It must be Hong Kong. -Hong Kong? So I can see Jackie Chan? -Right... That seems to be where the third devil hole is. I know Hong Kong best. Goodbye. I'll go there first. I better go home and pack too. What about me? Peacock. Lucky Fruit. How can you leave me behind? Ashura, I know you're here. Why is this so slow? I want it to be faster! This is not fast enough. I want it faster! This is fun. -Help! -Someone is up there. Stop. Help me... Excuse me... Hell?"... Make way! Hell?"... Hell?"... Hell?"... Hell?"... Save me! Help! Help! Help! Give me your hands. -Help her. -Lift her up. Please make way. I know you did it. I didn't mean it. You're the Virgin. They're mere mortals. How can they play with you? But I have no friends. Fine. In that case, I'll play with you, then. I've won again. She's just an innocent girl. I'll let her play a while longer and then bring her to Master. Look. They're selling ice cream. Be good and sit here. I'll buy you ice cream. Okay- Ashura! Have you played enough? I must punish you for being playful. I'm back. Where is she? After 20 years of investigating, we've finally tracked down the traitor. MKu... Even in a monk's robe, he can't hide his true identity. His disciple Lucky Fruit is one of the kids who escaped then. Kill him! And kill the other young man named Peacock as well. Kubka, this concerns the fate of our chief, the Hell King. I want you to set off immediately. Traitor Ji Ku, cooperate and we'll let you go. Otherwise, we'll chop your head off. Don't be rude. Take it if you have the nerve. Senior, since you're sitting here, you must have known that we'd come. It wouldn't be nice if we ganged up to fight an old man like you. We just want to find Lucky Fruit. Don't blame us if you won't tell us his whereabouts. Luckily, you found me only after more than 20 years. Lucky Fruit got to learn all my skills during this time. Senior. For the sake of our chief, we must find Lucky Fruit and that young man Peacock. You won't find them... because they're now in Hong Kong. Hong Kong? Where's Lucky Fruit? Ms. Okada, where is Peacock? He told me to come pick you up. He went looking for the third devil hole. He's a real busybody. Isn't it the same for you? Of course not. I'm under my master's orders to save mankind. I'm prepared to make sacrifices. Don't be biased against him just because he's not Japanese. Peacock may be garrulous, but he's actually as kind as you. I may not have any powers, but I've decided to tag along with you two. Who'll enter hell if I don't? You're a girl. You'll only get in the way. Good conquers evil. I'm sure you guys can win the fight. I can't stand you. I'll take you to the hotel. I'm not used to traveling with girls. Don't be wish y-washy. Let's grab a cab. Where are you going? Nikko Hotel, please. Okay- Isn't this where the hotels are? This is my chance to fleece you. It's right across. You can take the ferry. Aren't you taking us to the hotel? You have to pay HKD 800 first. What? You're trying to cheat us? You've picked the wrong victim. Picked the wrong victim? No... The meter's there. Read it yourself. "FARE" See? I'm not cheating. Stop... Stop! - Run! He didn't pay me. Catch him! Grab him! Stop! Look. All of the deceased are male, and they all died the same way. Their blood was sucked dry. -The photos are ready. -Thank you. -Don't mention it. -Master. It's Raga, all right. Who is she? This woman offers an important clue. Hello, News Room. What? Another dried corpse? Where is it? In the squatter area in the east? Okay, I'll be right there. How horrible! -Make way... -Out of the way! Peacock is on TV. Go away... Ashura? Sorry, no comment. When the autopsy report is out, we'll investigate further. That's all for now. Where is the crime scene? It's in the squatter area in the east. Dismissed... Get in. -Let's go. -Looks like the TV crews were filming here. Peacock was standing there. It's eerie here. Be on guard. Lucky Fruit! There are corpses here! -It's so disgusting. -Here. Lucky Fruit. It's me. Why are you so late? Peacock, you told us to wait at the hotel. I hate people patting my shoulder. I'm not trying to borrow money from you. So relax. Stop arguing. You guys are so childish. So what have you discovered? Ashura? Don't be rash. Ashura is being manipulated. She's innocent. Don't forget she's the Hell Virgin. Letting her go is tantamount to helping the Hell King. It's the entrance to the devil hole. Right. The third devil hole is right under there. Do you dare go in? And you? All right... Now you know the dangers of entering hell. I'm not afraid of ghosts. I'm only afraid of rats. I guess you aren't afraid of this lizard, right? I can smell blood. Something will show soon. Peacock! Wait. Peacock, Lucky Fruit, wait for me! Ashura, I'll get to you soon. Rid! Ashura started having emotions and feelings. This is her punishment! Ashura, wake up. Watch out, Peacock! Kill him! Ashura, get back your sense of kindness. -Fighting warriors, -Lucky Fruit, -show your power... Rid! -don't! Ashura! Rid! Are you all right? Run! We have to get out of here. I must save Ashura! Lucky Fruit! Rid! Fighting warriors, show your power... Rid! This place is going to collapse. Let's get out. Watch out! Is she dead? She's the daughter of the Hell King. Only she can open the Gates of Hell. Now that she's dead... the Hell King won't be resurrected so easily. You're wrong. Fate destined that she be the Hell King's daughter. But she's kind and innocent by nature. All this is beyond her control. I must bring her back to Tibet. I'm sure... Master can save her. Is that you, Peacock? Yes, Master. I've brought Ashura back. And who are you? I'm the student of the Koyasan monk Ji Ku, Lucky Fruit. Lucky Fruit. I know who you are. Master Ku Fong, please save her. She's the daughter of the Hell King. I didn't ask you to bring her back. Master, she has internal injuries. Please save her. You can't discern between good and evil. Don't you remember we're on opposite sides? Please save her, Master. I was also ordered by my master to kill her to stop the Hell King from resurrecting. But... But now I agree with Peacock. Actually... she's just... an innocent girl. She's of no fault. Fate made her the daughter of the Hell King. If she had a choice... I'm sure she wouldn't harm mankind. She's being manipulated by Witch Raga. Everyone has compassion. Saving a life is better than building a seven-story pagoda. Master. Do you know the consequences of saving her? We'll bear full responsibility. Killing her may not stop the Hell King from resurrecting. And when he does, we're prepared to give up our lives and go all out to fight him. Maybe she's fated to live. I'll try saving her, but whether she lives or not depends on her own destiny. I'll now use the supreme power of Mikkyo to gather the righteous power to revive her. What a miracle! Lucky Fruit, you must be curious about why I recognize you. I'll tell you the truth now. You and Peacock are actually twin brothers. You're both sons of Yang, born during the Yang hour, day, month, and year. Only the two of you have the power to fight the Hell King. Your father was a disciple of the Devil Sect. The Devil Sect forbade its followers from having children. He did not agree to it. He decided to rebel and had the two of you. That's why he was being chased. Since only the two of you are powerful enough to fight the Hell King, they wanted to weed out the root. At that time, I was touched by the grace of Mikkyo and got back my conscience. I couldn't bear to see the killing of little lives, so I took one of you and fled. That was Peacock. I decided to bring him up because I believed that justice would prevail. He'd become the nemesis of the Hell King. The other child, who fled into the jungle, was later rescued by Ji Ku. And that's you, Lucky Fruit. So you two are related by blood. Master-- Your master's wish is the same as mine. We taught you martial arts and spells to stop the resurrection of the Hell King. Both the names Lucky Fruit and Peacock have meaning to them. What do they mean? They're the two holy objects held in the hands of the Peacock King. Ji Ku and I wish you can also stand for justice. Stand for justice? Yes. Use your Yang power to stop the Hell King from ruling the world. But the fourth devil hole leading to darkness is not yet open. Although you've beaten Raga and saved Ashura, you can't stop the Hell King. He's definitely coming back. Two thousand years ago, he was beaten by the gods and confined to the Gates of Hell. But he has not given up. He's still waiting for the arrival of darkness. The fourth devil hole will soon open in Tibet. Only you guys can fight him. We'll do our best. Good. The life and death of mankind depends on you two. If the Hell King wins, the world will plunge into darkness. Do not back down. Show your power. Lucky Fruit! Peacock! You must win this battle. Ku Fong, you traitor! Hand them over at once. Kubka, after so many years with the Devil Sect... -you still refuse to repent. -Nonsense! You betrayed the Sect. You should have died long ago. I'm just acting under orders. Take this! Kubira... | Pity you. You can only be saved by renouncing evil. Peacock is mankind's only hope. Let him go. Master! Master. Master! You cold-blooded beasts. You can't even tell good from evil. Peacock, listen up. Don't force me to fight you. I must avenge Master. Stop. So you're both here. Kubira. Do you know why Master Ku Fong didn't fight back? Why? He was trying to sacrifice himself to enlighten you and make you repent. Nonsense! It's true. I only know... that my mission is to kill you both. Fighting... warriors-- Don't waste your breath talking to that baldy. Then can you beat them? Master? You guys have gone too far. Senior, please stay out of this. Shut up! Do you really have to kill them? I'm different from you. I can't betray Chief. I've killed your master. Now I have the Devil Wand in my hand. You guys must listen to my commands. Peacock. Peacock, Ashura's awake. Ashura! It's the Hell Virgin! Stop her. Lucky Fruit. Stay here. The fourth devil hole has opened. Ashura's not dead. That's why the Gates of Hell can be opened. Thanks for your help. It's too late. My master has resurrected. The world will perish. Ashura. Remember you're kind by nature. Ashura! Ashura. I'm sorry. I can't play with you again. Ashura... Our real enemy is up there. So we finally meet. He's the Hell King? Remember, good and evil can't coexist. I'm willing to stand by justice. Kubira! Buddha of Mercy, please bestow upon us faith and strength. Rid! Don't! Peacock! Lucky Fruit. Don't just stand there. Now's your turn to eradicate evil. But Peacock... Stupid! Someone's bound to make a sacrifice in this fight. Only the two of you can take him on. Don't you remember? Lucky Fruit, come on! We can join forces from the inside and outside. Lucky Fruit! Sorry, I'd rather give up my Hell Virgin identity. Ashura, don't. Ashura... Ashura, you'll destroy your own soul. Don't... Ashura... Ashura, how do you feel? Ashura... Hurry UP- Now's the time to use your Yang power. Fighting warriors, show your power. Peacock King? Peacock spreads its feathers. Rid! Where's Ashura? Where's Peacock? Lucky Fruit, where are you? Peacock. Lucky Fruit. Where are they? How are they now? Did they die as well? Are they both dead?
