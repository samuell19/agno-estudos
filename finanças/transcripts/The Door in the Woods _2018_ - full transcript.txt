(dark dramatic music) (squishing) (growling) - [Matt] Brute, Brute, come out of your hole, and beat the living black as coal. - [Ben] Carrie, we've been walking for like an hour. Are you sure this is the way? - She knows where she's going, Ben. - Brute, Brute, go back in your hole, and spare the living one more soul - Stop it, Matt! Should we really being doing this? There's a reason the story tells us to stay away from it, right? - Carrie's dad is in the high order, Ben, I think she would know. - Carrie? - It's probably just a story, Ben, don't pee your pants again. (chuckles) - Whoa. (dramatic music) - Who's going to open it? - Okay. (suspenseful music) (crows cawing) - I knew he wouldn't do it. - Hey, Ben, Carrie said she'd give you a kiss if you do it. - Ew, shut up, Max! No, I didn't! (dramatic music) (thudding) (rumbling) (heavy breathing) - At last he tried. Maybe if you're nice enough it'll just open by itself. (dramatic music) - Yeah, Ben, did you try asking it? (thudding) - Yeah, please, Brute Brute, come out of your hole, and beat the living black as coal. (chain rattling) (door creaking) Whoa. - Are you going to open it? (door creaking) (dark dramatic music) - What the? - How? (screaming) (dramatic music) (flesh squishing) - Ben? (roaring) (eerie music) (growling) (heavy breathing) (dramatic music) (panting) (screaming) (squishing) (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (panting) (vomiting) - Michael! - Michael, where have you been? What's on your face? (woman screaming) - What was that? (man screaming) (groaning) - Come on! (dramatic music) (girl screaming) (church bells ringing) (suspenseful music) - Stay here. (gunshots banging) (eerie music) (shattering) - Okay, come on! (thudding) (floorboards squeaking) - Matthew? (screaming) (roaring) (flesh squishing) (growling) (crunching) (suspenseful music) (roaring) (screaming) (light dramatic music) (squishing) (roaring) - Do you know what you've done? (crying) - No! - I'm sorry, Dad. - Stop, Marcus. We need to be quiet. (girl screaming) - Oh shit. - What are we gonna do? - But the Brute cannot be killed. Our only chance is to run for the woods! - We won't make it, Marcus. It gets everyone that runs. (heavy breathing) - We'll have to. (door creaking) (suspenseful music) - Oh God. (flies buzzing) - Don't look, honey. (eerie music) (growling) (screaming) - Mom! (squishing) - Come on! (dramatic music) (heavy breathing) - Dad, what about mom? We left her! - Quiet, quiet! Come on, this way. (Carrie crying) Be quiet! (hushes) Okay, okay, this is good. Listen, you stay here, you keep watch. I'll be right back. - Dad, no! (crying) Dad. (growling) (light dramatic music) (dark dramatic music) Dad? (heavy breathing) - I told you to keep watch, Carrie. - What are you doing, Dad? - This is not something you understand, Carrie. But we in the colony have a job to do. - What are you doing, Dad? - We are the only ones that can protect the world from the door. You betrayed your people, but you could still make this right. (dramatic music) - Dad, Dad, no! - I'm sorry, Carrie. This has to be done, Carrie. - Dad, no, wait! - This has to be done. - Stop! (screaming) - I'm sorry. (roaring) Brute, Brute, get back in your hole. The spirit-- (screaming) (dramatic music) (screaming) (squishing) (eerie music) (crying) (suspenseful music) (thudding) - Brute, Brute, go back in your hole. And spare the living one more soul.
