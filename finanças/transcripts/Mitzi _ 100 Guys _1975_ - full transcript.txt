(audience applauding) (lively music) (audience laughing) (audience applauding) (audience applauding) Hi, listen, I know you're probably asking the question, why 100 guys? Right? Why not five guys or maybe 500 guys? Well, there's a very simple answer. 100 happens to be a really terrific number. I mean, it's round, it's easy to remember, and besides I have exactly 100 of these. Okay, guys. (men cheering) Now, for your second question, how come Mitzi gets to do a show all by herself surrounded by 100 really great-looking guys? Am I right? Well, for one thing, I've been a very good girl this year. (audience laughing) And another reason is, I felt with so many different men we could explore the contrasts in interrelationships and well, what I mean is, it would give us the opportunity to make a strong social comment on the... (audience laughing) Oh, what the heck, I just thought it would be fun. (audience laughing) And, you know, being surrounded by so many guys, you start to realize that they're all different. I mean some guys are (growling) really gorgeous and some guys are terribly amusing and some guys are big and strong or small and smart or medium and rare. (audience laughing) Hey, wait a minute, I'm saving this for somebody. (lively jazz music) (audience applauding) - Hi. - Hello. - For me? - Uh-huh. - Hey, number 100. - Yup. - Just got in under the wire, didn't I? - Well, I would've stretched the wire for you, kid. - Oh, that's sweet. (Mitzi laughing) (audience laughing) - Oh, so that's how the West was won, huh? Michael, I cannot tell you how thrilled I am that you are one of my 100 guys. - So am I. Well, I just want you to know I'm a little hurt that I didn't get to do first number with you. - I don't understand.
