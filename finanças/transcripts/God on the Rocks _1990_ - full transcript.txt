[singing] [seagulls] [crows] [music playing] WOMAN: Everybody inside now. [birds chirping] CHILD: (SINGING) Baby, baby falling down. Down and dead. Dead and down. Down upon his baby head. Down and dead. Down and dead. [music playing] WOMAN: [laughing] Go on. Get the [inaudible]. Wait. [inaudible] [banjo music] [laughing] [buoyant music] Hey Margaret, do you want? Yes, please. Two large ones. I would say. Sandwiches or cornets? Cornets. [baby crying] [baby wailing] [bike bell] Hey, hey. Hey, hey. Why don't you blow your nose and give [inaudible] a treat. [band playing] Fancy a laugh? [laughing] We used to do it in Bishop Park [inaudible] processions. Watch this. [playing sour note] [laughing] I'm sorry, but you'll have to leave. It's a disturbance you're creating here. We'd paid our tuppence. There's no law against eating oranges, is there? But there is against litter. [sucking loudly] You'd better get up now. I'm resting me feet. Let's go, Lydia. I want to see the woods. Kiddie, OK. Help us up, then. Bye bye, beautiful. [laughing] [sighing] Come on then. Here you are. Come on. What you looking at? It's huge. Oh, ain't it funny? Can't I climb up? Don't get your dress mucky. I'll take it off. No fears. Why not? Because it's not allowed. What about you? I am my own boss. That's not fair. [sighs] I'll just tuck it in my knickers, then. Aye. Tuck it thy knickers. Come on. You do it front. It's that way. There. Come here. [laughing] [birds chirping] (SINGING) Baby, baby falling down. Down and dead, dead and down. Down upon his baby head. Baby head, baby dead. Down and dead. Down and dead. [music playing] [birds chirping] [murmuring] [sneezing] Achoo! (SINGING) Baby, baby falling down. Down and dead, dead and down. Maggie singing to Terence. Isn't that lovely? [laughing] Terence. Terence. Do you like that name, dear? No. Did you have a lovely treat day with Lydia today, darling? What was it like? Was it fun-- [glass crashing] [baby crying] There, there Terence. And Margaret, never mind now. It was just an accident. It was just a little accident. He's like a pig. He's going to love you so much. No, he won't. If I wasn't here, he wouldn't know anything about me. Yes, but you are here. I'm not here for him. Nobody was here for me when I was born, and I was all right. It would be better without people. If I'm being God, I'd have left it the dinosaurs. Now, Margaret, I don't think we ought to mention dinosaurs. Now you know what Father thinks. But they found the bones. Even Father has to admit. Bones are bones. Of course Father knows. We believe in Genesis here. All the primal saints do. We believe that God made us all complete to share with garden with Him. God made us in His own image. [baby farting] Oh, dear. His own image? If God looks like this, what's the point? You must speak to your father. [plates clattering] How's the brawn? Adequate. Lydia made it. I wondered about too much salt. Mm. [plates clanking] Mm. Perhaps a little too sweet, Eleanor. Indulgence. We must always be on guard against indulgence. And how was the bank today? As ever, it was all right. And how is the manager of the bank? As ever, he has [inaudible] I have been considering the subject for our prayer meeting. Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth a stinking savor, so doth a little folly, him that has a reputation for wisdom and honor. Margaret? Ecclesiastes, Chapter 10, Verse 1. Good. Yes, a little folly. A smidgen of sin. Last Sunday, I noticed one of the brother saints had brought a cushion with him to sit upon. Have he got [inaudible] I think not, Lydia. It was the beginning of an indulgence. When I spoke to the brother, he fell on his knees in shame. We prayed together to ask the Lord's forgive us. Are you done? Pass that plate, Margaret. [plates clanking] We the primal saints have set our faces against the temptation of the evil against the [inaudible], But pride itself can lead to sin. And what is sin? Sin is in the tiniest thing, the merest touch of worldly pleasure, the smallest trembling quiver of the flesh, slithering on the skin like a snake. We are the faithful. We are the elect. But we ourselves have sinned in prospect unless we guard the door, defend the lock, hold fast to the key of God. Hallelujah, praise the Lord. Hallelujah, praise the lord. MR. MARSH: Now let us pray, brothers and sisters. Let us pray for all sinners, for all those who one day will join hands with the Lord. For Lydia, our sister in God, let us pray. [inaudible] Bishop [inaudible] sent me. Hello. You looking for a maid who's a good scrubber? Yes. Well, I'm it. ELEANOR: You'd better come in. Me trunks will follow. I'm gagging for a [inaudible]. Uh, I think-- Shall I make tea? ELEANOR: I think-- I'm afraid you'll have to reduce the lipstick. Oh. Okey-dokey. ELEANOR: We don't allow lipstick here. Okey-dokey. No, no smoking. Okey-dokey. Margaret will show you your room. She has been sent. We are to work His will. (SINGING) Holiness, I've none to plead. Sinfulness in all I see. I can only bring my need, God be merciful to me. [birds chirping] Lydia, I'm bleeding. You can't stay in here. Why not? Can't you read? Private property. Mrs. Frayling. Get on. I'm bleeding. LYDIA: It's bonny here. She your sister? I'm the maid. Take her out. That's cushy, eh? It's their holidays. You know? Look. I'm still bleeding. LYDIA: So, what's your job? Head gardener. Whittle about your roses, do you? When I get the chance. Look. Come here. I'll kiss it better. You didn't have to do that. You can't go that way. It's private. Lydia, can I go? It's that your name? Lydia? Lydia [inaudible]. I'm going. [laughing] I'm going. GARDENER: Here. I know a song about a kettle. LYDIA: Well, keep it to yourself. GARDENER: I've got good voice. Sing in the church choir. LYDIA: Oh, I'll bet. [giggling] [music playing] MAN: Causes certain death. Your mother seems much better today. Much better. WOMAN: Do you really think so? MAN: All of us are so grateful to her for the gift of the house, and to you and your brother as well. My brother and I had nothing to do with the gift of the house. Now, if you'll excuse me, Mr. Morgan, I have a train to catch. [birds chirping] [gasping] Lydia. Lydia. Lydia, where are you? Lydia? Lydia? [moaning, grunting] [birds chirping] They're not back yet, Kenneth. They're not. They're not back. Margaret and Lydia. Where did they go? East Kirk for the treat. Why East Kirk? The seaside. The same sea stands at this front door. Yes, but the train ride. Train? It could be walked in 20 minutes. Kenneth, listen. They are not back. They know to be back at 5:00 to start tea. It is precisely 12 minutes past 6:00, and you are in this state. I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Margaret. Who is this Lydia? We know nothing about her. She could be anything. Should could be a kidnapper. Think what you say, please. I do think what I say. I think about Margaret. And you think about her, Lydia. Nonsense. No, you just pray and pray and pray for her. I have been shown. I am not in my own hands. I must further Lydia salvation. Lydia is a whore. You can see it sticking out of her. I mean, she's from nowhere. She is not from nowhere. She is from Bishop [inaudible] Oh, God. Oh. [crying] Eleanor, I think we ought to be quiet for a moment. Do you really think that God would allow Margaret to be harmed in some way by Lydia. LYDIA: Ugh, now we'll late for the bleeding tea. You hear? You hear? I hear the work that is in front of me. I hear nothing that suggests God's abandonment of Margaret. She is safe home. She is home. When is she safe? Oh, oh. Hello, Margaret. How was the seaside? Good afternoon, Lydia. We missed the train back, so we had to take [inaudible] pony. I'll do your tea before I get me things off, so don't fret. I've been to the woods today. [seagulls] Oh, god. The milk. Oh, god. [giggling] You scared the living daylights out of me. What were you thinking, then? Come on. Let's have it. Nothing. Didn't you like it? Going exploring? You didn't care where'd I'd gone, soon as you saw that horrible man. He weren't horrible. He were the head gardener. Rolling. What? - Rolling. - Shut up, talking like that. You were. I saw you, legs all horrible and wide. Lots of white legs, all beastly, big white hams, dense in them, dense in [inaudible]. Shut up! [glass crashing] [shouting] Shut up! Shut up! See? See? I hate it. How punitive. How punitive and strong. [music playing] Beautiful day, Mrs. Frayling. [chattering] [bike bells] Hello, saucy. And um, what do you usually do now? MARGARET: Oh, could I? Could I? The pier? The pianos? Dancing? Yes, please. MR. MARSH: It the voice of them that sing do I hear, said Moses. And he saw the calf and the dancing, and Moses' anger waxed hot. Exodus 32 somewhere. I hate Moses. What? I hate Moses. What about David? How dare you. MARGARET: David danced before the Lord with all my mates. Second Samuel, Chapter 6, Verse 14. [chattering] [clattering] We may go to the pianos. You cannot tell vanity if you have never seen it. Off you go. Yeah, you mean she's to go by herself? She'll be quite safe. Among all them lot? The [inaudible] Daytrippers [inaudible] from Middlesbrough. They are all God's children. Margaret is in God's power. I don't bank on that too. That is where you must be set right. You and I will go somewhere quiet and talk. Perhaps the woods. The woods? Wouldn't go in any woods with you. I'd leave me place rather than go in any woods with you. Very well, then. We shall just walk on the sands. [music playing] Lydia, may I ask you something? Have you observed the baby? 'Course I have. Have you observed how it cries? Of course it cries. Quite so. Of course, it cries. It is natural for it to cry. Well, that's all right then, isn't it? It is all right that we understand each other, but not all right in any other sense. I don't what the heck you talk about. Lydia, stop. Lydia, please. I am talking of original sin. The baby crying. Lydia, please. I'm trying to tell you about sin. [inaudible]. PERFORMERS: (SINGING) If you were the only girl in the world and I were the only boy, nothing else would matter in the world today. We would go on loving in the same old way. The Garden of Eden just made for two, with nothing to mar our joy. I would say such wonderful things to you. There would be such wonderful things to do, if you were the only girl in the world, and I were the only boy. MR. MARSH: It invades every corner of our being. When you hear the baby cry, you hear the cry of anger, concupiscence, jealous. Wind, more likely, I'd say. [crying] I will batter you. You all right, [inaudible]? You see? See what? The power of sin. Shut your face. You can talk to your missus all you like, but you do not talk about my kids like that. My friend, I was telling the young lady that she was-- [splashing] [laughing] Get up. You're doing it again. [laughing] [laughing] Now, you go over by the gents somehwere, and I'll go get Margaret. [laughing] The power sin. Lord, what will we do with you? You turn your watch in, Colonel. What are you blaming it on the baby for? Babies don't know any better. Don't bother with him. He's batty. My child, I blame no one, but we are all born in sin. Why's that? That girlfriend of his was born in sin all right. Because we inherit the sin of Adam. We inherit the sin of those who crucified our Lord, Jesus. But that were does that were the Bible people. Yeah, Romans. Philistines, surely. Romans, Philistines, Jews. He's bloody black shirt. MR. MARSH: It was humankind that nailed him to the cross. And are we not all humankind? Now wait up. Look into the eyes, brother. Look into the eyes of Jesus, and there, you will find the strength to withstand all temptation. Come and join us here as we learn today, for the first time in many of your lives, the real truth of the love of the Lord. [chattering] Look at your father, will you? He's found hisself a new drum to bang. Nice show, was it? Yes. Here. What do you say you and I go off down the woods? Go on. Get across. Get across. Keep going. Keep going. [laughing] Go on, then. Where? Wherever it is you go. Oh, you mean in case he comes. - Who? - That man. Don't pretend. Grand. You'll be lonely if he doesn't come. I'm just gonna ease me feet. [birds chirping] [murmuring] Everybody inside now. [chattering] [music playing] Poor old Lydia. No rolypoly today. [birds chirping] Drinkwater. Margaret. Ah. Margaret Marsh. Seen you about. Lurking around in the fronds. Fronds? Then off to the gardens. Not much joy there. No. Not much joy. Tell me, did you find that? What? Name's Drinkwater. I'm Margaret. Ah. [pouring] Who are those people dancing about? Loonies. Mad as hatters. They've given the house over to them, to the mad. Do they have any baby loonies? 'Fraid not. Madness generally comes with age. I've got a brother who's a baby. He's all slobbery and wobbly. All he does is suck, and cry, and sleep, and smell. They're calling him Terence. I don't like that. Do you? I think Terence is an awful name. I like Scummy. Scummy, Scummy, Scummy. DRINKWATER: Don't think I care much for that name. They even want me to pray for him. Do loonies have prayers? No real prayers here. There's a chaplain around somewhere, Welsh, very low. Ever so holy. Is he a primal saint? Maybe. We are at home. We are God's elect. I wouldn't think the chaplain's god elect. Perhaps he's not a primal saint then. He's a fucking fool. [gasping] Name's Drinkwater. Who are you? I think you're awful. ELEANOR: Margaret, how nice. Somehow or other, your father missed you, dear. Got a little wet on the beach. He came home on his own. He gathered quite a crowd. He's so pleased. [inaudible] going to preach every Wednesday afternoon. A treat for a good girl. Dainty, dainty. Margaret, what are you doing? They're all mad. Mad, mad, mad. Mad, mad, mad. I'm looking at Lake Maggiore. Magnificent. One of my best. It's not one of yours. It's William Leighton Leitch. I've lost Mount Parnassus, Rosalie. Behind the washstand. Mount Parnassus, on the road between [inaudible] and Delphi. I was there, you know. You're not even looking at it. That's William Collins, "Trees in Windsor Park." Certainly not. I've never been in Windsor Park in my life. Worse than the Lake District. Edwin, do you need to wear all that today? You never know in the Lake District. Will you paint today? No. Too many butterflies about. That nurse from Ward B has them out in droves. One day, I think I'll lead the all to the edge of the cliff. Not all that far, is it? Then, pop, pop, pop. Over they go. Pop, pop. [laughing] Pop, pop. Edwin. We had a child visit, you know, a while ago. Bonny little thing. Terribly serious. Are you sure? Our coast is clear. Come back for lunch. Lunch is over. You're losing your grip, Rosalie. Lunch is over. I thought you were a ghost. [jazz music] This is much nicer than East Kirk, isn't it? I thought now's the chance for you to meet someone different. Different? Yes, the Fraylings. They've been away. Now they're back. Do we have to go? Can't we g home. You don't want to go home when you're out with Lydia. Oh, for heaven's sake. What do you do with Lydia that's so nice. Nothing. Margaret. Margaret. Stop. Is this it? Ghastly. Shh, darling. You mustn't. [bell] - You must. She's quite right. Absolutely ghastly. Hello, Ellie. Miss Marsh. Hello, Charles. Hello, Eleanor. You're early. Is this yours? Hello, Binkie. This is Margaret. I didn't mean to be early. Good. I like little girls. I hear the baby's a boy. Come on. Come with me. Dear old Binkie, she'll never change. No. Times have changed, but not Binkie. MR. MARSH: We, we of the primal saints denounce the pleasures of the flesh, the trappings of Babylon, cinema, theatre, music, alcohol, cigarettes, painting the face which God gave us till it becomes a graven image. We renounce all excesses and all delight, lest it lead us from the path. ALL: Hallelujah. For what says the prophet Isaiah? All we like sheep are gone astray. Let us return to the path, brothers and sisters. Let us return to the path that leads to the house of God. And now, let us join our voices in praise, "Bringing in the Sheaths." One, two, three, four. ALL: (SINGING) Sowing in the morning. Sowing seeds of kindness. Sowing in the noontide and the dewy eves. Waiting for the harvest. In the time of reaping, we saw come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaths. Bringing in the sheaths. Bringing in the sheaths. We should come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaths. Bringing in the sheaths, bringing in the sheaths. We shall come rejoicing, bringing in the sheaths. [muffled speech] Useful girl. A little break for a butterfly cake. Come one break cakes? Oh, yes. Doesn't breaking imply noise? Not necessarily. What breaks silently, Eleanor? Dawn. Metaphor. Not allowed. Does your Mommy play this ever? It's called the Grand Great Word Game. No, it's the great grand word game. Yes. Sorry. Great, grand. Try it, Margaret. What breaks without noise? What breaks silently? Hearts. Rubbish. I don't believe in them. No, you know it's not allowed. Your mommy thinks hearts don't break. Oh, yes, they do. Father said it happened to Jesus on the cross, the meaning of the watcher and blood, John, Chapter 19, Verse 34, when the centurion put his sword in, blood and water issued forth. That's because Jesus died of a broken heart. And compare, Luke, Chapter 6, Verse 45. And anyway, Father doesn't like her to be called Mommy. And until then, may the blessing of the Lord Jesus Christ follow you on the path. Hallelujah. ALL: Hallelujah. MR. MARSH: Praise the Lord. [chattering] Well, Lydia? At least you didn't get wet this time. Wet or dry, I am in God's hands. Time to go. Hocus and pocus. That's all it is. When a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple of the city of Thyatira, which worshipped God heard this, whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken of Paul. He was so understanding, that man. Charles? He was my best friend. Actually, you're very understanding too. Thank you, darling. No, I mean, I just wish you weren't sometimes. I mean, always. I'll never be good enough. And I didn't like him saying Mommy. Yes, you made that quite clear, dear. But I wasn't rude, only telling about Jesus' heart. Father would of. Have. Wouldn't he? He doesn't approve of people like the Fraylings, so I don't think we ought to mention our little visit. Okey-dokey. Father [inaudible]. Father [inaudible]. Father [inaudible]. Ah, Mr. [inaudible] I've been on the sands. Oh, good. Good. And are we going to see you on Sunday? I'm afraid Mr. [inaudible] goes to all denominations. [shushing] Well, how was it dear? They sang from the heart. [crying] I trust you had a nice tea party, Eleanor? Yes, it was very nice. Good. I am considering asking some of the saints from to Easington to join on the sands next week. [crying] [seagulls] Come on, sleepy head. [clapping] Breakfast up. [groaning] You're-- what's that? Oh, oh. What's the matter? Oh, nothing. How do you feel? I do you feel? I'm not surprised. - Darling. Mumps. Mumps. Oh, what if Terence catches-- Oh, no. Breast fed, he'll not. If he does, it'd not do harm. He should get it over with before his balls is down. Lydia, leave the room. Can somebody shut the curtains, please? Don't worry, darling. We'll get the doctor. Who's ball's going down? Never mind. - Have I got them? - No. That's not fair. Shall I sing thee a song. (SINGING) There is a happy land far, far away, where they have bread and jam three times a day. Oh, how the angels yell when they hear the dinner bell. There is a happy land far, far away. [piano playing] MAN: (SINGING) If you were the only girl in the world, and I were the only boy. Nothing else would matter in the world today. We could go on loving in the same old way. The Garden of Eden just made for two, with nothing to mar our joy. I would say such wonderful things to you. There would be such wonderful things to do if you were the only girl in the world, and I were the only boy. Shall we say a prayer? It's all right. A prayer never goes amiss. Job 33:26. Yes, but his was boils. Boi Mumps is nothing unless your balls haven't dropped. Perhaps it was boils. Job's boils hadn't dropped. Yawning's terrible. [water dripping] - Hello. - Hello. What are you thinking of? Nothing. Hm. Dreaming over a water-sprout, a sprite, like a thoughtful dryad. Dryad's a sort of water fairy. [inaudible] thing to do with water being dry, but it's a good way to remember it. Are you a school teacher? I've just had mumps. - Really? Yes. This is my second day out only. You've been very quick. Yes, mother was a bit fearful, because I was terribly infectious when I came to tea. I thought there was something. No, that wasn't anything to do with the mumps, my being rude. You weren't. Mother said I was. They don't always know best, mothers. Oh, what an awful thing to do. Yes, that's right. [inaudible] [laughing] That's better. I didn't know you could make that noise. Come to tea. [shouting] - Oh, dear. - I slipped. Why don't you laugh? It's comic. Don't you read the comic cuts? Go away. I think I'll go home now. No, wait. It'll be all right. Ah, good. Lemonade. Apparently not. Margaret has just had mumps. [banging] Can we have some dropped scones, please? Why did she fall over? Weak knees. Runs in the family. So, mumps. What about the baby? He's breastfed. I hope no one else at home gets it. Well, Ellie won't. She had them when she was four, when you did. Had your balls dropped? CHARLES: Did she? BINKIE: Oh, of course. Don't you remember? With Miss Panel. We all did. What's a Miss Panel? Ah, Now, Miss Panel was a private tutor Charles and I shared. With Ellie. Just for three? Yes. What a tiny little school. No, it was immense. [inaudible] slipping all over the place. BINKIE: Oh, and we used to have lessons in the porch in big basket chairs. With holes in the arms you could drop sweets through. Oh, yes. [laughing] It must have been lovely for you to have my mother visiting, really lovely. [singing] You're very late. Been to tea to the brother and sister. The saints? No, Mommy's friends. - Mother. - Mother. To the brother and sister. Did you know this, Eleanor? Who are these? They're just where Margaret and I went the other day. I thought you went to the Prendergast twins. ELLIE: No MR. MARSH: Then who is this brother and sister? The Fraylings. Binkie and-- they've come back. [crying] I had a better time growing up than Margaret will ever have. MR. MARSH: You were in sin. - Rubbish. They were my friends. They are not serious people. I forbid you to see them. You can't forbid me, Kenneth. Ephesians 5:22. Wives, submit yourselves to your own husbands as unto the Lord. Thank you, Margaret. Oh, for goodness sake. It is goodness I am talking about. Well, I'm sick of it. I'm sick of goodness, and I'm sick of you. [door slamming] And what about Lydia? MR. MARSH: Lydia was sent to me. ELLIE: Why weren't the Fraylings sent to me? MR. MARSH: They were sent. They were sent for you to withstand. ELLIE: Why don't you realize it's all such an excuse? Excuse? ELLIE: All this hellfire nonsense. Mm. I heard about Miss Panel. Yes. And the basket chairs with holes woven in the arms. You put sweets in them, the holes. Charles put caterpillars in as well and worms. I was very naughty. Did you love him? Mrs. Frayling used to come in sometimes, her hair, so beautiful. It was a wonderful place. Where did it go? Nowhere. It's still there. I'm not, that's all. Mrs. Frayling changed towards me and Charles and Binkie went away. They're all right, Charles and Binkie. They're all right, but they're a bit boring, aren't they? Yes, they are a bit. I think we won't bother with the silly Fraylings anymore. Let's get rid of this nasty thing. What's this then? What's all this, eh? I want you. [seagulls] [glass rattling] [moaning] [screaming] [moaning] [inaudible]. [waves crashing] [seagulls] [bike bells] Hey, hey. Where's saucy? Hey, your dad's a loony. I heard him singing. Where you going, then? All right. You got a bit of a way to go yet. [jazz music] [doorbell] I've left him. Oh, Charles. My husband, Kenneth? I've left him. Oh, I must lie down. No. No, no, no.

If you would ever know what passion is. Madness. Be very good for you. But you never will. Madness never comes to you. [crying] Oh, hello. Ellie, Binkie's here. ELLIE: I don't want to talk to her. CHARLES: Yes, but she's got Mr. Beezer and [inaudible] and a man of God with her. Christ. No, Father Carter. I'm not laughing, Charles. [laughing] BINKIE: Charles?

Lots more, top of the stairs. - Hold on. I'll show you. Oh. Oh. [grunting] Oh, I just thought you might have the, uh, wrong room. No, I don't think so. Are you managing? CHARLES: Yes. I'm sending up Bezir. CHARLES: No, no. We're on our way. [muffled conversation] That awful man, [inaudible] He came in and took away my clothes. CHARLES: Ellie, please don't. Why?

He'd been wounded, you see, and I loved him so much. Then one day, his wife came and took him away from me. My lovely captain. She took him away. That's when I began to hate Ellie and anyone else who had a prospect of happiness. I've ruined all their lives with my hate. Dreadful, what one does in the name of love. [baby crying] [music playing] [shouting] My daughter. My daughter's on the rocks. Let's write for Ellie. Ellie who? Ellie who visited. It's for the Renoir. That damn thing. That'd be worth a lot. Don't Give it to me. I've got bags of money. [thunder] The ghost child. She's there. Huh? The child in the garden. She's there. But there were Ghost. She isn't there. Go see. She must come in. Hellish night. She must. No one would be running around in this, unless they were mad. [wind blowing] Margaret. Margaret, where are you? Margaret? [waves crashing] Margaret. Margaret. [waves crashing] [music playing] I'm no good. I'm mad That's what they say. Dare say they're right. You'll have to get a witness. [crying] [dramatic music] [waves crashing] [crying out] [jazzy music] [birds chirping] [sacred music playing] It was that bit over there our Margaret climbed up. Crikey. And Father must have drowned just down there. Right in that water. [groaning] Come and eat boys, before the rolls blow away. There you are. Fish paste. What's the matter, Terence? it's just with Father, drowning and all that. You shouldn't have told him it were fish. Oh, shut up, Alfred. Was he very brave? What do you know about our father? They say he was a nutter. Go away and play. Go on. [birds chirping] Hi-ya, Margaret. I've got you two. BINKIE: You missed the proceedings. Yes. Sorry. Lost track. Wasn't much of an unveiling in any case. It's a pity your mother couldn't get here. She's far too busy at the mission. Always is these days. How's the famous Renoir? It looks ridiculous over the fireplace. Ha. Hey, Margaret. Margaret. Hi-ya. Mind if I do you? Please do. Hey, you're not that different at all, old Margaret. Would you like a fish paste sandwich? No, thanks. You're taller. That's all. What did you do all the war, Lydia? Munitions. Making bombs and that. - Did you ever marry? No, never. I was not that daft. Oh, ain't it bonny. You haven't changed either, Lydia. Not a bit. Oh, but I have, Old Margaret. But I have. I were bloody daft in them days. [music playing]
