Shut down Tonglian! Go to hell! Save Baogang village! Come face the local fishermen! Tonglian goes away! - Polluting factory! - Baogang wants you out! Shut down Tonglian! I'm here reporting from - Baogang Village. - Save Baogang village! It's a village relying on fish farming. They've been fighting the pollution from Tonglian Petrochemical for 15 years. We can see that the protest led by newly elected mayor Chen yi-ta, reignite their anger accumulated for 15 years. But until now, there's been no response from Tonglian Petrochemical. The outrage of the fishermen has reached its flashing point. What's the point to shoot from the same angle as the others? Listen. If protesting worked, Tonglian would have been shut down ages ago! Shut down Tonglian! Save Baogang village! All you people from Baogang village. People from Baogang village. This sea was the livelihood granted to us from the divinity. But for the past 15 years, Tonglian has stolen, cheated and conspired to seize this sea from us. The water is seriously polluted, but Tonglian still refuses to admit that it is the cause of the pollution! My friends and neighbors, today I, Chen yi-ta, vow that if they still refuse to face us and continue polluting, we'll fight to the end! - Fight to the end! - Fight to the end! Fight to the end! Shut down Tonglian! Save Baogang village! Shut down Tonglian! Save Baogang village! Tonglian goes away! Baogang wants you out! Tonglian goes away! Baogang wants you out! Shut down Tonglian! Save Baogang village! Shut down Tonglian! Save Baogang village! Tonglian goes away! Baogang wants you out! Chief! Chief! Look! Save Baogang village! Over there! There! Tonglian goes away! Baogang wants you out! Stay away! 911 control center! A boat is ablaze off the shore at Tonglian Docks. Send backup! Hurry! Hurry up! FIGHT KANG WEN-HAI TO DEATH Hey! Stop! Stop! What happened? Get the camera! Hurry up! Get the camera! Hurry up! Someone's in the boat! Judging from the tire marks on page 2, the footage of the dash cam on page 7, and on page 10, 13, the report of the microfiber analysis, this case seems to be a straightforward car accident. Can you see anything suspicious? Page 3. Notice the blood spatter pattern on his body and in the car, despite the fatal head wound, there's hardly any blood on his shirt or car interior. Page 8. Wounds don't bleed after death. This photo shows that the scratches on his thigh didn't bleed. So I believe that the scratches were fabricated after he was dead. Here comes the questions. Who put him in the car? How could the car accelerate forward? We have to think about all these questions. Apart from determining the cause of death, what's more important is to find out the manner of death. After all, death is a process, not just a particular moment in time. Prof. Chou. But all the forensic evidence supports it's a straightforward car accident. If we overthrow the original verdict just for a few wounds that didn't bleed, are we being too assertive? Determining the cause of death isn't a democratic process that the majority wins. There are reasons behind each piece of evidence. We cannot in favor the evidences in quantity to rule out the critical few. In addition... Prejudice is part of human nature and prejudice is dangerous to a medical examiner. As a medical examiner, I only believe in science. Come in. Sir, you wanted to see me? - Have you eaten? - Not yet. My lecture overran again. The students don't dare scold me. That's so you! A burnt corpse was found in Baogang. Kaoyun Prosecutors Office requests a medical examiner. This happens to be your shift. The corpse is at Kaoyun Mortuary. Okay, I'll do the paperwork. Sir, something you want to tell me? The prosecutor in charge is Jin min-zhao. How coincidental! You know the protocol. It's not deliberately. I know. I'll go. - Mr. Wang! - Mr. Wang ching-hsiang! Mr. Wang ching-hsiang! What do you think of Kang's self-immolation? Care to comment on Kang's self-immolation? Mr. Wang! Mr. Wang, they're protesting! What do you think? Mr. Wang! Understood. Don't worry. I'll take care it. Good day, Mayor. They say every new mayor starts his term with some fireworks. Though we belong to different political parties, I can't help but congratulate you on that great firework... Counselor Chang, do you even know what you're saying? Mayor, don't be so serious. I am cheering for you! Maybe... we can go fishing together sometime? A life is lost. And you're in the mood for fishing? The mayor is here! Mayor! What do you think of the self-immolation incident this morning? Please, let us pass! Please move aside! Thank you! Thank you all! - Please let us pass! - Mayor! Thank you all. - Please move aside. - Mayor! - Thank you all. - Mayor! Here I'd like to express my deepest condolence to Mr. Kang's family. He sacrificed himself, so that the voice of Baogang could be heard. Here... I urge Tonglian Petrochemical to examine their operation thoroughly and hand in a plan for improvement. They need to take this matter seriously. I promise that within my term, I'll draft policies to stop exploiters from bringing harm to our environment! - Mayor! Mayor! - Mayor, how are you feeling now? Sorry! No more questions! We must leave! Mayor, this way please. Excuse me, please move aside! Please move aside! Please let us pass! BAOGANG VILLAGE Dr. Chou, this way please. Prosecutor Jin, Dr. Chou is here! It's been a while. Thanks. - We're ready for you inside. - Okay. The deceased's background? Kang wen-hai, 43-year-old male. No criminal records. A local fisherman. - Okay. What caused the fire? - The fire investigators are working on it. But the initial exam shows it was gasoline. That's his wife and child. Mrs. Kang, please sign here. What a martyr! The kid is still little. How will they live on? By law, you may attend the autopsy. Would you like to? Mr. Kang wen-hai. I'm Dr. Chou chien-sheng. I am going to anatomize your body. I know you've suffered a lot. Please communicate to me and show me the answers. I'll do my best to listen. The body smells of gasoline. No obvious traumatic wounds over the head and the anterior trunk. 9% forth-degree burn injuries over the body. Subcutaneous tissue is involved. But both hands do not have clench in fists. Uneven distribution over the anterior and posterior trunk. The burns spread unevenly on the front and the back. 18% of injuries are on the back. Especially the head is most severe. Suggestive of the gasoline was poured down from the head. Soot particles are found in the nose and the throat. But no inhalation injury in the bronchi and the lung parenchyma. No typical signs of burning to death in the lungs. Take blood sample from the heart for carbon monoxide test. The deceased had jaundice and varicose veins. And biliary cirrhosis. The liver shows micro-nodular cirrhotic changes. Stage IV liver cancer. He had no more than three months to live. As for the kidneys... Tubular necrosis is seen. But... What about the kidneys? Turn the lights off. Switch on the UV light. Yes. Look! What are those fluorescent spots? - You... - I'm fine. Dr. Chou, did Kang die from self-immolation? What's that blue florescence? I've never examined such a perplexing body. What do you mean? How many times can a man die? Can you tell me your conclusions now? It'll take a few days to compile the autopsy report. Keep me posted if there is any new development. Wait! It's a highly sensitive case. Even the slightest hearsay will trigger... I know how serious this case is. But you know me well. I won't jump to conclusions. You'll be the first to know when the report is done. Dr. Chou! Prosecutor Jin asks me to give you this. Thank her for me. It's three hours' drive to back to your office. You must be exhausted. We've book a hotel for you. You should take a rest first. Good, thank you! Mom! Dad always walked like this. Stinky monster, come out now! Dr. Chou, thank you for teaching me so much. This is my first case. So I've prepared this. It's not money, it's Chinese mugwort. It keeps evil spirits away. No need, I'm not superstitious. - You must take it! - Hey! There's no need! - Hey! - You're welcome! The police refuse to disclose information about the self-immolation happened in Baogang yesterday. But we've learned that the deceased is 43-year-oldKang wen-hai. Judging from the sprayed paint left at the scene, Kang was determined to kill himself in protest against Tonglian Petrochemical. Known as "A-hai", Kang Wen-hai has become the national hero after the self-immolation incidence. Respond quickly within 12 hours, the authorities order Tonglian Petrochemical to suspend all operation until it passes environmental inspections. It's estimated that this injunction will cost the corporation 30 million dollars a day. Mayor Chen, who led the protest yesterday, gained an immediate boost to his approval rating. The deceased had the rare hereditary Wilson's Disease. Disorder of copper metabolism. Chronic intoxication from his blood examination. Copper sulfate and large amounts of heavy metal were proved. Copper sulfate? No wonder we could observe blue fluorescence. But copper sulfate doesn't like the cause of death. The liver and renal tissue sections present signs of shock. From the autopsy bone by you yesterday, only a tiny amount of carbon soot is found in the terminal bronchi. That means that he was shock before the fire started. Rather than inhalation of a large amount of smoke caused shock. Right. I felt unusual during the post- mortem examination yesterday. How could someone pour gasoline over his own head in shock status? Obviously, it's not self-burning. Someone staged it. But sir, what's kind of shock? I can't determine it yet at present. The strange thing is... From the histopathological changes in the hippocampus tissue sections, it took more than four hours from shock to die. Four hours? I've never seen such a case. If one isn't resuscitated, he'll die within ten minutes. You say it took four hours? Too many contradictions for this case. I always think that we should find the cause of death to conclude chain of death so we can determine the cause of death. Wait. You said Kang borrowed money from you? Yes. He owed me money for a long while. His fish farm is abandoned. He kept borrowing money from the villagers. Everyone was avoiding him. And, his fishing boat was broken a long time ago. Not sure how long it was... Can it still run? Did he have a job? Come on! Who dared to hire someone like him! He lived off his wife! She does odd jobs like shucking oysters or mending fishing nets. You're talking nonsense! A-hai worked in the ice factory. He's a hero of Baogang. How can you talk about him like that? I'm telling the truth! What nonsense? What truth? You're full of crap! - What are you gonna do? - What? Tell me! Who is telling lies? Enough! This is a police station! I've questioned her for 3 hours. She knows nothing. Just insists that he'd never set himself on fire. JIN Hello? Hello, Dr. Chou. This is Jin min-zhao. Have you got the test results? I'm still discussing it with Dr. Kao. No initial conclusion? We have many suspicions. But I can tell you one thing, he didn't set himself on fire. That's what his wife said too. A dead body doesn't lie. And the fluorescence on his kidneys? Anything to do with the cause of death? We found a large amount of heavy metal residual in his body that caused chronic poisoning. The blue fluorescence comes from copper sulfate. But I'm not sure if it's related to the cause of death. Copper sulfate... I'll contact you after we finish investigating. Dr. Chou, I'm Sung is a journalist. May I ask you a few questions? I'm sorry. I can't tell you anything. You often say, the cause of death is not the manner of death. What's the cause of Kang's death? And what's his manner of death? Sorry, I need to go. Excuse me! I heard Kang's wife refuses to accept his self-immolation. - Please leave, miss. - The police haven't disclosed anything. What caused Kang's death? Did you find anything from the autopsy? Sir, I'm going to Baogang again. What for? You've got everything you need. You can ask forensics for anything else. This case is not simple at all. She needs my help. She just won't ask for it. Investigation is the prosecutor's job. Medical examiners shouldn't get involved. You know the protocol. I'll fill in my absence form later. Why do you come to the District Prosecutors Office? To help your investigation. There is no need. Kang's cause of death is very complicated. You need medical expertise. Let me help you. After all, I know it better than you and Captain Yang. You told me Kang didn't set himself on fire. And we've ruled out accidental death. So now it's a murder investigation. If there's any developments, Captain Yang will let you know. Do you have a suspect? Not yet. Kang bought an accident insurance policy. So we can rule out his wife for now. If she wants to get the payout, she wouldn't stage a self-immolation. No payout if you burn yourself to death. The heroic martyr is now a murder victim. How are you going to explain this to the public? The journalists would love this sensational headline. Before I clarify the contradictions in the autoptic findings, you shouldn't rule out any possibilities. We can work together. Just like before. Just like before? Dr. Chou, this pressure is nothing. I'm not the novice I was before. I just want to help. Why do you have to speak to me like this? Then why do you have to speak to me in that arrogant tone of yours? Chou chien-sheng, whenever you try to help or be sympathetic, you always sound so condescending. Have you ever considered how people feel being looked down by you? You know how people looked at me before? I won't be a prosecutor relying on her medical examiner fiance. Is that the reason you left me without a word? We're not going into this now. If you really want to help, speed up the autopsy report. Anything else? Hello. Has the defendant arrived? I've gathered all the evidence. Will the witness come forward? We'll see what the lawyer says. Okay, I got it. I'm on my way. I need to be in court. Please leave. And, don't tell anyone about the copper sulfate. I don't want others to know about it. BAOGANG HERO A-HAI LIVES ON! JAUNDICE I'm a little doctor, holding a stethoscope Pressed to the chest, listening to the heartbeat I'm a little doctor, holding a stethoscope Pressed to the chest, listening to the heartbeat I'm a little doctor, holding a tongue depressor Boy, what are you playing with? Toys my dad gave me. Just like you, I'm a doctor too. Little doc, does your head hurt? Yes. Present for you. Wei-wei, come take your medicine! Did Mr. Kang mention any health issue before he died? I've told them everything I know. A-hai worked flat out to pay off the debts. He had no time for protesting. No way he would set himself on fire. Is it possible that someone paid him to do that? What are you talking about? It was caught on CCTV. What did he say to you? Can't you stop asking such strange questions? Aren't you a doctor? Can't you tell me why my husband died? You knew he had stage IV liver cancer. I talked to the insurance agent. She told me that you spoke to her, asking about the payout after your husband died. Since you haven't got the death certificate, she can't start the process. Mom! My head is hurting! Mom... Your head? My head hurts so much. Let me rub it for you. I have many doctor friends. This is my number and address. If you need any help, come to me. Sorry for bothering you. Anyone out there? Anyone out there? It's very dangerous in here! Be careful! The door is broken. You texted me about copper sulfate yesterday. I checked the 35 fish farms we're monitoring, and found certain amount of copper sulfate in 12 of them. The amounts are all below the regulatory limit. But we find something they have in common. The cement used in these 12 fish farms came from a company called Chenyu Environmental Corporation. Chenyu Environmental Corporation? Yes. This is the cement used to construct fish farms here. It contains heavy metal residues, including copper sulfate. Thirteen years ago, on the Southwest Coast, heavy metal residues were found in some buildings. The health of their residents was impacted to a certain degree. Later, we did find traces of petrochemical industrial waste in the building material. It's the so-called toxic lime. Fifteen years ago, when Tonglian expanded its plant, a large amount of toxic lime was dumped into the sea. Tons of fish were poisoned to death. Amongst the dead fish, they had one thing in common. Blue fluorescence was seen in their bodies. Tonglian was fined millions of dollars and asked to improve. There have been no incidents since. Unfortunately, no photos were kept back then. Only written records. Cement from Chenyu, Tonglian Petrochemical, toxic lime and Kang's body... Are they connected? Indeed, Kang's fluorescent kidney connects all these dots. If they are truly connected... Kang's body is the key link of all these connections. With it, we can prove that Tonglian illegally dumps heavy metal waste pollutes the sea and the village, causes chronic poisoning and cancer in the villagers. Since there is something wrong with the cement, I should start with Chenyu. Maybe we'll make a breakthrough. Prosecutor Jin. Why are we staking out such an insignificant factory? Does this relate to Kang's death? Even if there's only a small chance, I have to be sure. Okay, but you don't have to do it yourself. I've seen many young passionate prosecutors like you. But you can't live on passion. Take Kang's case for example, the bosses demanded we close it quickly. I really can't hold the line much longer. Did you find out who owns the factory? Yeah, it's Counselor Chang hung-chen. Counselor Chang? Why are you so surprised? These factories are run by either gangsters or politicians! Anyway, we shouldn't waste our energy. Other things need investigating. Kun, what brings you here? Wei-wei, why didn't you tell me uncle is here? Here's $50,000 for you. Our family owes you too much. I still can't pay back the $30,000. Keep it! You need it. These are for A-hai's funeral? Yes. It's fate. He's better dead than suffering. Not only A-hai. Everyone in the village is in pain. You believed A-hai set himself on fire? Of course I do! I don't! Hsiu-yun. A-hai and I grew up together. It hurts me to see you struggle like this. But now A-hai is not yours only. He represents the entire village! Tonglian has destroyed our lives. Finally, with A-hai's sacrifice, we can force them to stop. We can fight back! This is what the village wanted for years. Think about Wei-wei. His father is a hero now. You should be proud of his sacrifice! If you say he didn't set himself on fire, you're letting down the whole village! Please, talk to the police again. Don't let his sacrifice be for nothing. Thank you for accepting Councilor Chang's invitation. Welcome to my yacht! Screaming Eagle, 1992. Try it! Mr. Wang, I don't know anything about wine. Just say what you want to say. I still have work to do. You're so forthright. No wonder the villagers love you. I envy you having work to do. I'm out of work for the moment. I had such good luck! Two big fish! Mayor, have some fun! Stay longer! More food for tonight! I've said all I need to say. As long as I hold the mayor's office, I won't allow Tonglian pollute the village any more. Is that clear? Mayor, let's make something work. We can discuss any terms you like! Right, Mr. Wang? Of course. Don't be so stubborn! A compromise is good for everyone. Isn't it? Are two enough? Two? A-hai died for the village. How can I explain to the villagers? Do you really think his sacrifice could be exchanged for something? Prosecutor Jin! You have no rights to start your own investigation. They let you see the body assuming I'd authorized it. Get out! Please get out! Then please tell me. How are you going to deal with this slogan? And... Why did it take him so long to die from the moment he went into shock? What was the cause of shock? If you have the evidence to explain the paradox, I'll leave right away. It doesn't mean you could touch Kang's body. I heard that you also talked to Mrs. Kang. In her current mental state, you shouldn't have disturbed her. Your job is to find out the cause of death, - not to interfere in my investigation. - Why have you become so passive in investigating? You were different... Are you alright? - Are you not feeling well? - None of your business! Why do you still keep the sonogram? You still can't stand the smell in the autopsy room. Yes. So you can't stand me because I can never get rid of that smell. Don't ask things about the past. I don't want our relationship to complicate the case even more. It's not helping. The reason I'm here isn't to intervene in your investigation. I know I shouldn't overstep your authority. I'll leave as soon as I deal with the clues. I suspect Tonglian sells toxic lime that contains heavy metal residues to Chenyu. Counselor Chang Hung-chen owns Chenyu. Chang has always supported Tonglian. I checked both companies' records. There is no transaction history between them. The two are completely clean. So? So clean as to arise suspicion. Let me show you a place. Did you back up the data? Yes, I did. - Then bring it over. - Okay. - Prosecutor Jin. - Prosecutor Jin. This is Dr. Chou. They're my comrades at Greenhe. We've been here collecting data for two years. If you can testify that Kang was poisoned by copper sulfate, even if it didn't cause his death, I can prosecute Tonglian. Dr. Chou. We've gathered tons of evidence of Tonglian's pollution. All we need is the testament from a medical professional. So that's why you brought me here? You're more interested in prosecuting Tonglian than solving Kang's death? Yes. I'll find out why Kang died, and the plot behind it. Copper sulfate can have many origins. It's also added to animal feed. It doesn't guarantee any link to Tonglian. Kang can't represent the whole village. Unless you take samples from all the villagers. As to medical testament... You should know better. To prove it medically, there must be direct evidence. If we don't have that, I won't testify. I'm sorry. I can't help you. I have my principles. Besides I think your association with Greenhe might work against you in court. A prosecutor should be completely neutral. What are you doing? Everyone has desire and weakness. So do you. Sometimes one just can't stick to one's principles. Is the logic in your head more important than the feeling your heart? I only know you're very important to me. It was just a test. Just a test... We both put truth before everything else. Come in! Come in! ZHENGYU ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION Something is going on. Captain Yang! I've got it. The transaction record. The engine in Kang's boat was new. Captain Yang! Someone is here to see you. - Captain Yang. - Prosecutor Jin. Mrs. Kang changed her statement. She says her husband hatedTonglian so much, that he wanted to set himself on fire in protest. What should we do now? The case is difficult enough. That's not possible. - She's lying. - I think she... Captain Yang, I'll call you back. Sir. Your application for a search warrant of Tonglian is rejected due to lack of evidence. It's obviously a self-immolation case. His wife has confirmed it. Why do you want to search Tonglian? - No, we have some leads... - Besides, the Minister of Economic Affairs asked about the case. He hopes it can be closed soon to prevent further social disturbance. Just close it as a suicide case as soon as possible. Send the file to the High Prosecutors Office. Stop making trouble. You've got many cases waiting. I am so close to uncovering the truth. How can I close it? You young people are egotistical and reckless! Stop causing me more trouble! Mrs. Kang! Mrs. Kang! Mrs. Kang! I don't think she is here. She disappeared after she changed her statement. Excuse me! You must be Prosecutor Jin? I'm a journalist. The thing is... I'm writing an article about Kang wen-hai. I'd like to ask you some questions. Sorry. No comment. Kang's wife changed her statement. Would you like to respond to that? Don't you understand Chinese? I heard you're investigating Chenyu. What's the connection with Kang? Who told you that? It's still under investigation. I can't tell you. Wait. Then I'll just write the prosecutor has "no comment". I'm not sure how the readers would interprte it... If you're so desperate to learn the development, come to the prosecutors office tomorrow. Prosecutor Jin, what are you thinking? There is no way I would hand over this case. I need to be proactive. The death of Kang is still being investigated. Jin min-zhao, the prosecutor in charge, takes everyone by surprise as she breaks the rule of sub judice this morning. She'll hold a press conference in five minutes to brief the public on the development. What she is about to disclose attracts everyone's attention. We will continue to report. The evidence points towards Kang being incapacitated before his death. There are also several other leads that still need pursuing. What kind of leads? Kang bought an accident insurance policy. His body had an unusual level of copper sulfate. The cause of death has yet to be established. The police have ruled out self-immolation, so the investigation continues. Are you treating it as a murder case? Have you identified any suspects? The show is becoming more interesting. This prosecutor has caused us so much trouble. I had to pull some strings to stop her a few times. Mr. Wang, will the copper sulfate implicate us? As to the finding of copper sulfate, my office has targeted specific factories and has started our investigation. Our results will be published soon. Chou, you've lost your mind! - Go get the canned oxygen! - Yes. Low temperature prolongs brain death. Do you know what you're doing? I found traces of icicle in Kang's tissue. He fell into shock in a low temperature environment. That's how he got chilblains on his fingers. You used liquid nitrogen. You'd have died if you inhaled too much. Come on. Jin held a press conference this morning. She announced Kang's death wasn't from self-immolation. Why? What on earth is she doing? You've got the answer! Turn in the report at once! And then close the case! You hear me? You know something smells bad about this case. Yet you still ask me to look away? There is a limit to your investigation! Don't break the protocol! Give me all the data. Everyone condemns me after the press conference. Are you in danger? So I need to be prepared! It's not the first time I face such threats. - I'm used to it. - Professor. Find somewhere safe to lie low. So our effort of the past two years won't be wasted. Prosecutor Jin. All the data is here. Okay. A-HAI IS STILL ALIVE MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE IDIOTIC LADY UNSCRUPULOUS PROSECUTOR How did you know where I live? Graffiti slandering you is all over the place. It's not that difficult to find it. Anyway, it's not the first time. How can you laugh at it? What was with the press conference? And the copper sulfate? The source is still unclear. Why did you tell the press? It's very urgent. I needed to buy some time. Do you have any solid evidence? No? So the press conference is a smoke screen? I've my own way in investigating. Jin min-zhao, stop messing around! You're asking for trouble. Desperate times call for desperate measures. If I didn't take action, the case would be closed. I'm sorry. It's late. I want to rest. Don't avoid me! Just stop! Don't push yourself so hard! I'm doing my job. I'm not pushing myself. Why should I stop? I'm worried about your safety. You know the biggest difference between us? You're always so cautious and meticulous. In fact, you fear losing the sense of security. I'm different from you. I'm disappointed at the system. But I always believe in the law. I just want to march forwards. I can sacrifice everything for justice and truth. Am I one of the sacrifices you made? Yes. And our child too. I had an abortion. What do you mean? Every day we face countless misfortunes and crimes. How could I imagine bringing up our child in such chaos? - You said you had a miscarriage... - How could I imagine... - ...due to an accident. - ...that we could have a happy family? - You didn't want to talk about it. - The thought was getting stronger. - I know you thought... - In the end, I decided to - have an abortion... - You left without saying a word. You let me live in questions and pain for so many years. I didn't know how to explain it to you. So this is your justice? Your truth? Every word you heard just now is true. It's the truth. Thanks. Thank you for telling me the truth after all these years. You've made me start to hate you. Mrs. Chou. At this stage, the development and the heartbeat of the fetus are both stable. Though it's only 5.9 cm long, it's very energetic. It's a very healthy baby. The results of the blood and urine tests show that you and the baby are in good conditions. We'll schedule your next prenatal visit. Next comes the breaking news. Despite Prosecutor Jin disclosing information pertaining to the Kang wen-hai case yesterday, the Ministry of Economic Affairs has announced... - Hi. - Check out. Let me get the bill. Dr. Chou! Please save Wei-wei! He has a high fever. He's not seeing clearly. Let's get him to the hospital! During the week of the mandatory shutdown, the Ministry of Economic Affairs' own experts carried out exhaustive inspections of Tonglian's wastemanagement process. -All the experts agreed that -Yes... as the waste treatment system has been improved, Tonglian meets all necessary criteria. - Yes, Chairman, I understand. - Meanwhile... Prosecutor Jin made it clear that... Yes. - Kang didn't die of self-immolation. - Yes, I'll fix it. To clear Tonglian's implication in the case and to stabilize civial unrest, we announce that Tonglian is permitted to resume its operation within a week. What do you want? Let go! Understood. Please... Okay, don't worry. We'll do our best. Thank you. The brain tumor has spread. The neurosurgeon will see him soon. They'll make every effort to save him. He is in the best hands. Thank you. Don't worry about the following procedure. We'll be here for you. It'll be fine. Mrs. Kang. I've been wanting to ask you. Why did you change your statement? If you say Kang killed himself, there will be no payout. What are you and Wei-wei going to do? It didn't go as the plan. If it did, A-hai's death will be determined as accidental. Then you could get the payout. Who else knew the plan? Wei lin-kun came to me. He said A-hai is Baogang's hero. They asked me not to say the wrong things. I worried they might harm Wei-wei. So I changed my statement. Nothing could survive in our fish farm for years. Both A-hai and Wei-wei were ill. Life was very hard. A-hai had talked about making false insurance claims many times. I was against it. That day, he told me... I've made the arrangement. You don't have to do anything. Just wait at home. You must trust me. Once you've got the insurance, Wei-wei will have the chance to get better. I'm a dying man. Even if you disagree, I'm dying anyway. I can't be a burden to you anymore. He kept everything from me. I didn't know where he went. Low temperatures put him in shock. The only place that is cold enough and close to the docks is the ice factory. His body was inert in the boat. But we found carbon particles in his lungs. It can only mean that, when he was dragged from the ice factory, he was still breathing. He must have felt very cold. I'm so useless. I couldn't save my husband. Now I can't save my child. Your call will be directed to voicemail. Please leave a message after the beep. Hello, Dr. Chou. Captain Yang, is Prosecutor Jin with you? No. I thought she's with you. I've been looking for her all day. They told me she didn't go to work. Hey, Dr. Chou. We found a transaction record. Wei Lin-kun bought and installed the engine in Kang's boat before the incident. Wei hasn't showed up at work in two days. I got it. Your call will be directed to voicemail. Jin! Jin! Your call will be directed to voicemail. Hello, Captain Yang. Something has happened to Jin. This is the Office of Baogang Village Those attending Kang's memorial service, please gather before the temple. Dr. Chou, we've triangulated Jin's phone via satellite positioning. She's at Mazu Temple by the port. You're heading in the opposite direction. U turn! Those attending Kang's memorial service, please follow the signs and gather in front of the temple. Captain Yang, I'm approaching the temple. Now? Turn left! Jin is about 50 meters away from you. This road is closed. I can't drive past. Too many people. I'm getting out of my car. Those attending Kang's memorial service, please follow the signs and gather in front of the temple. I'm in the crowd. I can't see her. Is she still in front of me? Hey, wait, wait. Turn right into the alley. She's 20 meters to your northeast. Dr. Chou! Dr. Chou! Jin has stopped moving. She's in the square in front of the temple. The square? Got it! Jin! CHOU CHIEN-SHEN Hello? Jin! Where are you? Are you okay? Are you in the square? Jin! Say something! Jin! Jin! I can hear you. Where are you? Jin! Where on earth are you? Jin! Jin! Jin! Jin! Jin! A-HAI REST IN PEACE Jin! The number you dialed cannot be reached. Your call will be directed to voicemail. Please leave a message after the beep. Here! Look at this! The deceased is Jin min-zhao. 30-year-old female. No criminal record. A prosecutor at Kaoyun Prosecutors Office. The fire investigators estimate that the deceased had been burned for three hours before she died. I could never comprehend the pain of death. But now I finally understand. With each incision that I made, I felt I was cutting into my own body. Damn it! I will bring the bastard to justice! What have you found out? We search through everything at her home but we can't find her laptop nor the files related to the case. They should be backed up online. But nobody knows her password. PASSWORD INCORRECT. PLEASE TRY AGAIN. PASSWORD INCORRECT. PLEASE TRY AGAIN. PASSWORD INCORRECT. PLEASE TRY AGAIN. Mayor, where are we going? I got in! It worked. That silly girl... She collected so much evidence on her own. We had no idea the pressure she'd put herself under. You damn idiot! Come here! Mr. Wang. It's all him. It was this bastard's idea. I didn't know he'd find a dead body, and burn it. He went too far! I'm sorry, Mr. Wang. That's about Kang's self-immolation. What about the 800 million you extorted? Get out! Are you deaf? Mr. Wang. I'll absolutely follow your every order. I promise that, during my term, nothing will happen to Tonglian. The incident... Can we pretend that it never happened? Do you know why I love to groom my horse? To make it surrender to me, so it'll be obedient to me. Then I can control it. Give it orders. You're different from other horses. No! No! I'm the same! Mr. Wang, I'm too greedy. I'm too greedy. Mr. Wang, it's all my fault. Please give me another chance. I did you wrong. In fact, I should thank you. The self-immolation you staged forced the plant to shut down. The stock price fell sharply. I was able to buy them back low. When we resumed operating, the price shot up. The money I made from it is enough to buy a few yachts and horses. By the way, don't say I didn't tell you. You'll make the headlines again. Thanks to evidence provided by conscientious citizens, Mayor Chen's naked greed and hypocrisy has been exposed. He was behind not only the protest, but also the self-immolation, in order to blackmail Tonglian. Here is the recording. A-hai died for the village. How can I explain to the villagers? Do you really think his sacrifice could be exchanged for something? Nevertheless... If you do want to resolve the issue, we can have a proper conversation 1992... I prefer 1998... You mean... 800 million? I didn't say that. But Mr. Wang... There're many years ahead. If I can bail you out this time, your business can go back to normal. I can convince the villagers that Kang's death wasn't in vain. What do you think? What's your plan? You just pretend that you've improved the waste treatment system. Pledge some charity work in the village. At the same time, I'll calm the villagers anger for you. Hand out some compensation. After some time, everything will be back to normal. We can then co-exist peacefully. Doesn't it sound nice? But I really can't afford to pay you 800 million. I am giving you the ocean. Can't you afford me a few fish? If you honestly can't, then I'm sorry to say, Tonglian will be shut down. If it wasn't for this recording, like every one of you, I thought Mayor Chen was an honest politician. He lies to all of us. God is watching us. A hypocrite like him is bound to be despised. Shameless! He deserves to go to hell! Chen takes advantage of us all. He deceived everyone. Captain Yang. Can you get the CCTV footage from the square, around the time Jin was killed? Miss Sung, aren't you always chasing an exclusive? Before Jin was killed, we located her phone's position at the temple. But there were so many people. The villagers also put joss paper in iron cages. It's so hard to see anything! Look for me. You? Our phones connected briefly. I kept calling her, she didn't answer. But one call at 4:13pm got through. Just one call. Find all the images at that point. We might get something. Okay. Stop! Here it is! - Any images from the square? - Yes. Stop! That one! Stop it! Enlarge it. It must be him. He looks so familiar! He was there when Jin and I were scouting Chenyu! Check her files! That's him. He and the truck were seen at Chenyu. The truck is registered under Tonglian. Yes. So Tonglian is involved in Jin's death! This morning, Counselor Chang accused Mayor Chen of extorting 800 million from Tonglian. Chen had threatened Tonglian with Kang's death. But Tonglian has resumed its operation. Now they are getting back to Chen. Tonglian is really something. Damn! No wonder Jin could never persecute them! Tonglian must have known she had evidence against them, so they killed her. Not enough. These aren't enough. They're only against one individual. We can't prove the relationship between this man and Tonglian. Captain Yang! Wei lin-kun has turned himself in. You say you killed Kang wen-hai? I'm guilty of his death. He fully trusted me. He asked me to help him one last time. He had been planning this for a long while. Daddy, take your medicine! He asked me to pretend to find him dead in the ice factory. So his wife could get the insurance payout. But I didn't do what he asked. When no one was watching, I dragged his body out of the ice factory and put him in the boat. I staged the self-immolation. I'm so stupid! I believed in Mayor Chen! I thought we could bring Tonglian down. In the end, A-hai's last hope was shattered. I let him down. I let A-hai down. Okay! Calm down! Calm down! One more loyal voter used by a politician. So this case is solved. What about Jin's death? What should we do? I won't let her die for nothing. I have an idea, but I need you to pull it off. If you help me, you may get into trouble. Will you do it? I'd like to thank the Ministry of Economic Affairs and the public, for giving Tonglian another chance. I took Tonglian Petrochemical over from my father 15 years ago. We've always believed in giving back to society, for what we gained from it. For years, we've created 32,000 jobs and contributed in 6.5 billion tax revenue. I'm here to announce that we will launch an environmental protection fund of 200 million. By setting high standards, we'll achieve sustainability we will accept public scrutiny and supervision. Thank you. What pains me the most is that, since Mayor Chen took office, he opposed Tonglian under the cover of environmentalism while extorting money from me. If Mayor Chen was capable of killing Kang, he was capable of killing Prosecutor Jin. It's time to ask the first question! Excuse me! Sorry, no questions today. You just said you'd accept public scrutiny. Why can't you answer questions? It's fine. Go ahead. You mentioned sustainable business. I wonder what's the secret of running such a huge corporation like Tonglian? We always remind ourselves of finding a balance between profit and environmental protection. Fifteen years ago, when you became managing director, poisonous waste was dumped into the sea and a large amount of fish died as a result. Do you still remember that? It was an accident. We've improved the waste treatment procedure and met all the requirements since. Have you heard of Greenhe? According to their investigation, waste from Tonglian is the major cause of cancer among the villagers of Baogang. - I don't know what you mean... - I mean... Does Tonglian sell toxic lime to Chenyu, to turn into cement? About this question... As I mentioned earlier, we always meet the waste treatment requirements. Tonglian has never done business with Chenyu. But I have evidence showing that trucks registered under Tonglian went in and out of Chenyu. Under the cover of Chenyu's business, you not only save the cost of treating toxic lime but also make money out of it with Chenyu. I deny all your accusations! If we had all these problems, why are we allowed to resume operation? - What evidence do you have? - You want evidence? Everyone, please check your phones. Based on the evidence in hand, Tonglian has never properly treated its toxic waste for all these years. It has even bribed government officials! Don't listen to her lies! In the past years, Prosecutor Jin kept collecting evidence against Tonglian. Did you kill her because she held the key evidence? Mr. Wang, did you kill her... Did you bribe the Minister to resume operations? - Mr. Wang! - Please answer our questions! Mr. Wang, did you burn Prosecutor Jin to death? Please answer our questions! Mr. Wang, please explain. Mr. Wang... Excuse me. Mr. Wang ching-hsiang. I'm Captain Yang of Kaoyun Police. Please come with me! Mr. Wang please answer the question! Please answer the question precisely.
