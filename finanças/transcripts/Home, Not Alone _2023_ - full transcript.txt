Please! Please, stop! No! Come on, Jordyn, come join me. You could've pulled up further, Mom. I know. I guess I find it hard to believe it's really ours, you know? I bet there's dead bodies in the basement. Oh, Jordyn. Or the previous owner died under mysterious circumstances. No, he just fell behind on payments and the bank foreclosed. I heard it was your big day. Yeah. Oh, Kendall Jones. We met briefly at the bank. I'm a local realtor. Oh, hi, yeah. Uh, this is my daughter, Jordyn. Oh, hi, Jordyn. I wanted to bring something for you. Welcome to the neighborhood. Thank you. If you need help with anything, just let me know. We should have lunch sometime. Sure. How about you get settled in and then give me a call? Wonderful, thanks. All right, take care. See ya. Oh, looks even bigger than I remember it. Uh, Mom, why is there furniture here? Because the previous owner sold it with the house. If the guy couldn't make the mortgage payments, why didn't he sell some of it? I don't know. But aren't we lucky? It's beautiful. Oh. That must be the movers. Be right back. Huh, weird. What? Huh? I said, "What?" As in, what are you looking at? Oh, is this some sort of movie reference? You want me to guess? Um... Oh, please go. Oh, wait. I... How about we start again? I'm Noah. Noah Ryan. Jordyn Wilson. Lovely to meet you, Jordyn Wilson. Did you just move here? Yup. You going to Memorial High? How'd you ever guess? You don't seem too happy about it. Why wouldn't I be happy? Isn't it every girl's dream to be dropped into a new high school in the middle of her senior year knowing no one? That's not true. What's not? You know me. Terrific. So I'll see you tomorrow. On the bus? Bus? Nobody takes the bus. How do you get to school? I drive. I'll be by at 8:00 to pick you up. I know you like to give me a hard time about rarely cooking, but even you have to admit this is way better than anything I could make. Come on, Jordyn. It's our first night here. So? New house, new start? I just don't understand why we had to leave. I didn't want to. No, I'd say we both needed a change. Well, I didn't ask them to suspend me. You didn't have to. Vaping on school property, after they had already given you a warning... It was just one hit, barely one. Okay. A suspension isn't exactly a badge of honor on a college transcript. Who says I even wanna go to college? Okay. Can we not have this conversation? Not tonight. I'm not the one who brought it up. Look, your dad and I always said that you could pick any career you want as long as you go to college first. Well, at least you guys agreed on one thing. Have you talked to him recently? Who, Frank? Yes, your dad. Nope. So, are you excited for tomorrow? First day of school. Were you planning on taking my picture and walking me to the bus stop? I was gonna offer you a ride. Actually, I already have one. What do you mean? A ride for tomorrow. I make friends quickly, Mom. That's what you wanted, isn't it? Save the rest of my pizza so I can eat it for breakfast, please? Uh-hmm. Jordyn? What? Couldn't you wear something a little less black on your first day? It's not my first day. It's the middle of my last year. Can I make you something to eat? Toast you something? No, I'll have my pizza cold. Did you hear anything last night? Mom, where's my pizza? It's in tin foil. A creaking in the middle of the night, did you hear that? No idea what you're talking about. And... and the pizza's not here. It's on the bottom shelf. Huh. I wonder who that is. I told you. I have a ride. Oh, I thought you were joking. Can I meet whoever it is? I don't wanna be late on my first day, Mom. But, Jordyn, I... - Hey. - Hi. But, Jordyn, I just... - Uh, shouldn't I say hello? - No. - Oh. - Let's go. Have a great day, you guys. Hmm. Hey. Let's see about that. Oh, I'm sorry. I... I'm slammed. I will get to the numbers by the end of the day. Oh my gosh, to hell with the numbers, tell me about the house. Well, there's not much to tell. I mean, you saw it. Came with some furniture. And now we're just unpacking, you know, trying to make it feel like ours. But you like it, right? I love it. I mean, Lucy, I have an indoor pool. I know. Which I can't wait to swim in it's a big step up from that hovel the two of you used to live in. Our house was quaint. It was a disaster. And Ms. Jordyn, what does she have to say about it? You know Jordyn. I mean, we could moving into the Taj Mahal and she would feel put out. Well, you deserve a medal. Why? You threw your hat into the ring and worked hard for a promotion. All while shopping for a house so you two could have a new start. I'm just doing what any mother would do. - Uh-hmm. - Just trying to give us - a better life. - Hmm, with no help from Frank. Not like he'd know how to. Oh. I am just happy that I don't have to listen to his abusive criticism, you know, or wonder what his ulterior motives are. Oh, my gosh, he was exhausting. Have you heard from him? Not a word, surprisingly. Well, enjoy it, the job, the house, all of it. - Uh-hmm. - You deserve it. Hey, Sara, here's those numbers that you asked for. Thank you. Okay. I better get back to this report. I took a half-day so I could be home for Jordyn today. - Oh, that's sweet. Okay. - Okay. Bye. No. Okay. Wow. Oh. What'd you do with your key? I'm sorry. You were expecting someone else. Yeah, my daughter. Oh, uh, well, I won't keep you long. I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm Colin Murray. Hey. Sara. Uh, Sara Wilson. Um, can I help you? Yeah, you live in my house. I mean, I've lived in your house. I mean, you bought my old house. Oh, yeah, you're the guy? Yeah, yeah, I was in between jobs and I put all my savings into maintenance, so... Well, you kept the place in great shape. I mean, I can't believe it's a hundred years old. Those wood doors off the living room, they're gorgeous. Wow. I'm so happy you appreciate the place. Yeah, right. Well, uh, I just... yeah, I just wanted to introduce myself like I said and I'm a contractor, so if you have any questions or need anything, please, uh, feel free to call. That's my number. Look, I'm sorry, I, uh... I didn't just live in the house, I grew up in it. My grandfather built it. Oh. Yeah, the, uh, wooden doors are from Barcelona. He built the house during Prohibition and there even used to be a Speakeasy in the basement. It's not still down there, is it? Um, no. No, the... the swimming pool area consumed it. Oh. But when I was little, there were cubbies and secret doors hiding where they kept the alcohol. How interesting. I have a lot of good memories in this place. I just wanna make sure it's, uh, taken care of. Yeah, of course. Oh! I... I did have one question for you. Um, I just heard something in the walls. You didn't have a pest problem, did you? It sounded pretty big. Uh, no, I didn't. Okay. Well, we sure do love the place, my daughter and I. We'll do our best to take good care of it. Well, I won't keep you any longer. You have my number. Please feel free to use it. Thank you. Thanks. No problem. You're right on my way home. I mean for everything. You made my first day a lot easier. And also for the pizza. Oh, well, that was just me doing my duty as a citizen. You can't move here and not eat at Angelo's. I better get going. My mom is probably glued to the front door waiting. Yeah. Yeah, okay. Uh-hmm. Listen, like I said, I appreciate all this, but I don't want you to think the new girl is just some easy... Uh, Jordyn, no, I... I swear. Not for one second. I'll see you tomorrow. What are you doing? There was this guy standing by the side of your house. He took off around the back. What did he look like? I don't know. It happened so fast. Maybe someone from the electric company or gas. No. No uniform. And why would he run? I don't know. My mom, she's in the house. Hey! Why don't you let me go first, okay? He had plenty of time to get away. Get away where? I don't know. Into the woods over there, or he could have gone back around the house on the other side. Either way, he's not here now. Let's just make sure, okay? I mean, we looked everywhere. But if I were you, I'd still tell your mom. I will, but I don't know what she's gonna do about it. You didn't get a good look at him. He moved too quickly. God, Mom! I'm sorry. I just heard you guys talking. Mom, this is Noah. Uh, hello, Mrs. Wilson. I just live down the road. Oh, it's nice to meet you, Noah. Why don't you guys come inside? Uh, he can't. He has to get going. Yes, I... I... I have to get going. Hmm. Could I ask a favor before you go? Yes, ma'am. Super! Little bit left, and then take it back just another inch, and then down. And just straight. Oh, thank you, you guys. Why are we moving it? It looked fine before. Oh, I just wanna make the space feel new. Yeah, it looks good. Thank you, Noah. So I'll pick you up tomorrow morning? Sure. Okay. Nice to meet you, Ms. Wilson. Oh, you as well. - See you tomorrow, Jordyn. - Bye. He seems nice. I guess. Oh, don't give me that "I guess." I saw the way you were looking at him. Mom, he's the only person I know here, so I let him give me a ride. - That's it. - Uh-huh. So how was school? Um, Mom, how long have you been here? What do you mean? Here at the house? Maybe an hour and a half. Why? Did you... hear anything? Yeah, I heard your voices. That's why I opened the front door. No, no, no. Before that. Did you hear anything else? I think I might've heard some rodents in the walls. But don't worry, I'm calling the exterminator. Why? Well, when Noah pulled up, he saw some guy lurking around the side of the house. Okay. Well, the previous owner came by just to introduce himself, but he was hardly lurking. Well, Noah saw a guy run around the side of the house. So we tried to catch him. What? What happened? He got away. Okay. You don't believe me. No, I didn't say that. I'm just wondering if Noah saw something else and maybe thought it was a person. He's on varsity tennis, Mom. I'd say his vision is pretty good. It just seems odd that some guy would be snooping around. Okay. Thanks so much for coming back over. No problem. Now they can't get in. - So that's it? - That's it. I, uh, laid the traps and filled any holes they might use to enter the house. So, you should be fine. Oh. I was about to call an exterminator. But then I thought, you know, what if the noises I heard wasn't animals and it was just pipes clanking? Yeah, well, I'm glad you didn't. It doesn't look like you have a pest problem to me. But, uh, better safe than sorry, right? Well, thank you for dealing with it. You saved me some money, anyway. No, it was my pleasure, really. And Like I said, I know this house. Yeah. Great. Well, hey, looks like you're really... getting settled in. Yeah, we're trying. Are you sure you don't want some coffee? I was just about to make some. Oh, well, I wish I could, but I really need to get going. Okay. Maybe some other time. Yeah, I'd like that. Okay. Thanks. So how'd you sleep? - Fine. You? - Good. Jordyn, I need to talk to you about something. Mom, we had this talk in middle school. Plus, they bring it up every year in health class. No, not that. Um, did you move the couch last night? - What? - I want the truth. Mom, you asked Noah and I to move the couch for you yesterday. Okay, but now it's back. So I thought maybe, you know, because you were irritated with me for questioning whether or not you saw someone outside the house. Um, I was irritated. So you moved the couch? Why would I do that? I don't know. Maybe to make a statement? Here's a statement. You're crazy. Give the kid a break. She's had to deal with a lot in the last year. Count yourself lucky she's still in school. I know. But I just don't understand why she would do it. Maybe she's trying to assert herself, make her presence felt in the new house. Possibly. Just ignore it. It'll stop eventually. Lucy, you should be a therapist. Hmm. Hardly. Well, I don't know what I would do without you. Oh. Hey, oh, sweetie, can you hand me that one? - Uh, yeah. - Just wanna make this place feel a little bit more like ours, you know? - What is this? - It's a shadow box. You know, with memorabilia from the house. Huh. How do you feel about Thai food tonight? Um, I'm going over to Noah's. Oh. Will his parents be there? Of course. Well, you do need to eat, sweetie. They're gonna feed me. We just have a big history test tomorrow. Oh. Are you guys... you're dating now? God, Mom. He's just a nice guy. All right. Just wake me up when you get home. Okay. Oh. Oh. Hey, sweetie! Oh, God, Mom. You scared me. I thought you'd be asleep. No, I got a little preoccupied unpacking boxes. So how was studying? It's good. Great. All right. Well, goodnight. Love you. Sleep good. You, too. - Oh! - Come on, you guys! You really scared me! Uh, I'm sorry, Mrs. Wilson. I was just, um... Uh, I... I took his history book by mistake. - Oh. - Uh, here. Thank you! I should get going. Noah. Uh, let's just use the front door. Always, please. - Of course. - Please. Sorry. We didn't wanna wake you up. I'm sure you didn't. Don't give me that look, Mom. Jordyn, I'm not naive. Let's keep the windows closed and Noah out of the bedroom from now on, okay? - Fine. - Great. Goodnight. I don't want you to panic, but it sounds like you have a poltergeist. Stop it. No, a ghost might be moving things around in your house. Okay, well, Lucy, you know that I don't believe in that sort of thing. So there must be some other explanation. Well, have you asked Jordyn about it? I didn't want her to feel like I was accusing her again. And I guess I didn't wanna scare her. Yeah. Oh. I have a 10 o'clock meeting. - We'll talk later, okay? - Yeah. Okay. Hey, Colin. Fine. Yeah, do you have any free time today? So, do you think I'm crazy? Oh, yes. Certifiably so. I'm serious! No, I don't think you're crazy. And I'm... I'm really glad you called. I just hoped, I don't know, maybe you might have some sort of explanation for what's going on. I don't. And I'm finding it a little hard to believe what you're telling me. So nothing like that ever happened - when you lived there? - No. Oh. Do you... think it could be your daughter? I did at first when the couch was moved back. Hmm. She did have a history of lying before we moved here, but she was with a friend last night. Well, maybe she and her friend. I have reason to believe that they didn't. Did you ask her what she thought might've happened? I didn't wanna scare her unnecessarily. Look, I would suggest going to the police. But in this case, I'm not sure how much they can really do. I know what they'd do. They'd think I was crazy. Why don't I take a look around? And see if anything strikes me as suspicious. I'd appreciate that. Why don't you come over for dinner tomorrow? Sure. Oh. - Ooh. - Thank you. Looks good. Can I get you guys anything else? No, thank you. - Okay. - All right. Yeah. Sorry. Every time I call, I'm either talking about me or the house. Not at all. I gave you my number for a reason. Okay, Colin Murray, tell me more about, I don't know, the construction that you do. Oh, it's mostly residential renovations. Are you renovating your place at all? A little. But I'm just renting right now. You know, until I'm ready to buy again. Hmm. So are you married? No. I haven't met the right woman and... Oh, come on, tell me. Uh, I... I just... I always thought that I'd get married and we'd live in the house. Raise a family there. Oh. Well, what about your parents? They're both deceased. I'm so sorry. No, uh, they had me when they were older and lived long and happy lives. Yeah, we had some good times at that house. Well, I know Jordyn and I will, too. It's a special place. Yeah, it really is. Lucy was right. - This place is pretty good. - Uh-hmm. No phones at the table, please. Sorry. It's your dad calling you. I know. Have you talked to him recently? No. Well, he's called you three times tonight. I mean, if he's trying to get in touch, we should just talk about it. Mom, I haven't picked up. Don't worry. Okay. Well, I'm... Um, I have an English paper to finish, so... Okay. Sure. Ugh. Not again. Noah? Noah? Frank? Hey, Sara. What are you doing here? I was hoping to see our daughter. In the middle of the night? I keep calling her, but... that girl, she, uh... she sure knows how to hold a grudge. Wonder where she gets that from. If you wanna talk to our daughter, you have to contact me per our court order. And if I had, you'd let me see her? If you do this again, I'm gonna call the police. No need. I'm going. You're looking good, though. Oh. Who's Noah? Frank, get out of here. Okay. When I asked for something to drink, I thought you'd bring me, like, seltzer or something. Oh! You deserve better than bubbly water. - Uh-huh. - Plus, your mom was, like, "No alcohol." Except for this whiskey I found in the back of a cupboard. Yeah, she's not much of a drinker. Anyways, let's toast? - To having an indoor pool. - Yeah. - Oh! - You don't like it? Um, not really, uh, but I need something - to help me get through tonight. - What's tonight? My mom is having the guy who used to live here over for dinner. Should be good and boring. I'm sorry I'm late, Lucy. Oh, my God. So, tell me everything. Did Frank really show up last night? Tapping on Jordyn's window, to wake her up in the middle of the night, to talk to her. I mean, if he just wants a relationship with Jordyn though, maybe that's a good thing. Hmm, maybe. I just can't tell if that's the only thing. Wait, do you think he's been breaking in and doing those things? It's entirely possible. Maybe he's desperate. Maybe. Oh, before I forget, I got an extra house key made for you. Just in case I lock myself out. Or need me to swim in your pool. - Or that. - Yeah. Anytime. I just need to make sure I'm back in time for that dinner. Just a few more hours of studying at my place, I promise. Yeah. Dad? Hey, kiddo. - Who's this? - Uh, Noah Ryan, sir. You're not supposed to be here. Look, you're my daughter. I have to see you. Well, you should have thought of that before you left. Come on, sweetheart. I know you. Let's cut the angry teenager routine. I have nothing to say to you. Let's go. Jordyn? Come on. Jordyn! I told you last night - to stay away. - Yeah, I know. I just thought I'd give it one last shot. - Are you stalking our house? - What? No, I just... I just wanted an opportunity to talk to Jordyn. Clearly, she doesn't want to. Okay, so you're not sneaking in and moving things around on us? I'm trying to make contact. Not scare her. Why? Is something going on? Is someone bothering you? No, no, we're fine. Never mind. Are you sure? You two are safe? - We're fine. - I could help. The best way you can help right now, Frank, is by staying away. Fair enough. You know, it takes time to earn trust back. So just give her some space. Fine. I'll keep my distance. Until she is ready. So, what, is this guy like your boyfriend now? Boyfriend? Please. He's just a nice guy. You know, like Noah. Oh! - Hi. - Hi. I hope I'm not late. Not at all. Come on in. I know you said not to bring anything, but I couldn't come empty-handed. God forbid. Thank you. Colin, this is my daughter, Jordyn. Hi, Jordyn. And pleased to meet you. I've heard a lot about you. Oh, great. Come on. Have a seat. Well, she's looking good. Oh, yeah, the house. Oh, yes, the house. Anyway, so, uh, Jordyn, how do you like your new school? Um, same as my last one. I don't. Can I get you some wine? Please. Jordyn, what do you make of the latest occurrence in the house? What occurrence? I haven't had a chance to talk to her about that yet. Oh, gosh, I'm so sorry. Oh, it's just that some things we moved again. And you think I did it? Did you... do it? - Oh! - Oh, I'm sorry. I overstepped. It's just that your mother and I, we were... We were just looking for a rational explanation. For what? Uh, the fact that the shadow box is hanging up again after I took it down a few nights ago. Oh, well, well, busted! You got me! Yeah, yeah, yeah, I really just don't like seeing shadow boxes mistreated. Ridiculous. Wow, I apologize. I didn't mean to... She's just an angry teenager who's been through a lot. You know, my husband... my ex-husband, he was pretty rough. I mean, not, uh, physically, but just not the nicest of guys. He used to put us both down a lot. And then, one day, he just left. That's terrible. I'm sorry. You know, he came by this morning, so I know that's why she's upset. Makes sense. You would think that this whole situation would bring us closer together, but... - Have you ever thought... - A therapy? Uh, yeah, we've had therapy. No. No. Have you ever thought that... well, you know, maybe it's your ex-husband doing these things? Yeah, I did, but not anymore. Mom, where are the paper towels? What happened? Something spill? Um, yeah, just my entire plate of pasta. Okay. Let me grab a towel. Hang tight. Hey. Jordyn, uh, why don't you sit for a sec? Why? Oh, just hoping maybe we could have a moment together to connect. Okay. Um, let me guess, you're gonna tell me how much my mom means to you, and how you understand that it's hard for me to see her with another man. Oh, wait! No, no, no, no. It's totally that you know how much I mean to my mom, and how I now mean a lot to you. Am I getting close? Actually, I was gonna tell you to stop being so ungrateful that you get to live in this house. Okay, well, your, uh, comforter is in the wash. Just make yourself another plate, okay? I'm good. Uh-hmm. Oh, sorry about that. Where were we? You want some salad? Sure. Looks good. Thank you for such a lovely dinner tonight. Oh, thank you for checking out the house for me. Yeah, the doors and locks are secure. No one's getting in here. Thank you. Oh, hang on! Hey! - What's this? - It's just a small thank you. This is the, uh, Prohibition Amendment, written on the side there. I saw it at this little shop, and it just made me think of you, because of the house's history. Wow. Thank you. It's my pleasure. And I'm so sorry about Jordyn's behavior tonight. Oh, well, we were all teenagers once, right? Yes. That, we were. It's not just that he's on her side, Noah. I am telling you there is something really off about this guy. How so? I feel like he's using her to get his house back or something. Or maybe he just likes her. Oh, my God. Ugh! I'm watching them talk outside right now. I bet she wants him to kiss her. It's pathetic. - Ew. - Oh. Uh, my mom's calling. I got to go, okay? Okay. See you tomorrow. We should do this again. Yeah. I mean, I would love to have you over at my place, but, uh, not really nice enough for entertaining. Oh, that's okay. I mean, really, I just wanted to say thank you for the advice and... But I would love to take you out to a restaurant sometime. I mean, if you'd like. Yeah, I'd like that very much. Okay. Well, good night. Good night. - Bye. - Bye. Good morning. I said good morning. Do you wanna at least talk about last night? - No. - Jordyn, please. Mom, your creepy new boyfriend called me ungrateful because I am not thrilled about living in this house. Well, I... I'm sure he didn't call you ungrateful. He was probably just urging you to appreciate living here. No. Mom, he did, and he was weird and mean about it. Can you not do this? I mean, I really want us to have a new start. A new start would be you starting to trust me. Okay, you lied to me about drinking and vaping. Oh, my God, that was just a phase. And I'm over it. Well, it takes a minute to earn trust back, okay? Even the people you love the most. Oh, and take Noah's camera back to him. That's not Noah's. - Whose is it? - I don't know. Colin's? Uh, that's not Colin's. He didn't bring that over last night. God! I hate this house. So, it doesn't actually work? Uh, no. These cables, they weren't even plugged in, so I don't think that camera can record anything. You know, I remember admiring this tree when I bought the house. I feel like I would've noticed that. And you didn't install anything when you lived here? Uh, no. I didn't install any security cameras around here. I never felt like I needed them, so. What do you think it's doing up there? Well, maybe the bank thought they should have one, when they were showing the place, and then, you know, just forgot to remove it. Okay. So no one's watching me? Watching you? Uh, no. That camera looks pretty inactive. Oh. I... I'm sorry. You must think I'm out of my mind. Not at all. I think you're just getting used to a new house and all its quirks. I hope I didn't mess up your morning by calling you here, for basically nothing. It's no problem. Really. I'm happy to help. And, I was close by, so... Okay. So are you becoming a thing? Yeah, I like him. Like him, like him? What are we, in junior high? To be honest, it's just nice to have someone. Of course it is. And not just for companionship, because of the house. It's still freaking you out? I feel like someone is inside the house watching me. I found a camera this morning that neither Jordyn nor I have ever seen. It doesn't make any sense. I need to come over and burn some sage. - That's not necessary, Lucy. - No, it wouldn't hurt. Jordyn told me this morning that she hates the house. She wished we'd never moved there. She's just angry. Maybe. Oh. - Oh! - What you need is proof. Of what? That there's something messed up about this house? Sure. It's just, now that she's dating Colin, ugh, and he's, like, in love with this place, so she feels like she needs to be too. I just... I wanted to see how twisted he is. Yeah. Hey, we should find out where he lives and follow him. - Why? - Because I bet he does something creepy and we can use it against him. Come on. Isn't your mom gonna be home soon? Nope. We have time. There's nothing on this guy. There's a racecar driver with the same name. Hey, click on that site. No, you have to pay for that one. I'll pay for it. Okay. Here's my card. And we don't have a lot of homework, so we can go check out his place later. Yeah, good idea. Great. Okay. Here we go. Just type in his name and... check this out. That's my address. Maybe it's just not the right house for us. I mean, it's so lovely and it has everything we could want but... Yeah, houses are like people. You click with some and not with others, and sometimes for no discernable reason. I gotta be honest, there's been some strange things happening. What kind of strange things? Things being moved like furniture and I've heard noises. I... Like you think the house is haunted? I usually don't believe in things like that. But I don't know what to think. I mean, there's no good explanation. Well, your house should be a place where you can relax and... and you're able to be yourself. Exactly. I feel like that's what we're missing. Yeah. I know. I've sold enough houses to enough people to know that a home is a place you need to feel safe. You and Jordyn, you deserve a place that you can feel comfortable. Yeah. You know, if you're interested in selling, I could find plenty of buyers. Really? Oh, for sure. It's a historic home with an indoor pool. Now, you will lose equity but you should get your money back. It could be worth it. Okay. Okay. Great. Well, I'll go ahead and send you some links to some properties in the area you might be interested in. Thank you, Kendall. Gosh, I really appreciate that. It's my pleasure. Hey, Mom? Yeah. Uh, Noah is picking me up. We're going to the varsity basketball game. Great. Is your homework done? Uh, I won't be late. Okay. Mom, um, how much do you know about that Colin guy? I mean, plenty, you know, for getting to know someone at this stage. But you've never been to his place? Yeah. I... I think he's embarrassed by it. Um, well, I looked him up online today and this address was listed for where he lives. You can't totally trust an internet search. Yeah, but I went to, like, a legit fancy site that you have to pay for. Well, he used to live here, so maybe they haven't updated the records yet. No, because we were listed as living here and we just moved in. Hmm, that's a little strange. What if he lives in his car? And the reason why he's always here is because... he doesn't have a place to live? I don't get that impression but you're right, I am still getting to know him. Just be careful. I know you're being protective for me, sweetie. And I really appreciate it. Okay, but I also know that he's the first guy that I've seen since your dad. - Probably... - Never mind. Listen, go have fun tonight, okay? Enjoy the game. I'm gonna go to bed soon anyway. Do you have your key? Yeah. Okay. Have fun. Love you. There was a loose wire to the breaker box. It happens. The whole thing is really disconcerting. I think maybe I should call the cops. I agree, the picture is weird and disturbing but it's not really a crime. I'm still shaking. Jordyn's gonna be home soon. I don't want her to see me like this. Let me go see if I can find something to calm your nerves. You're still up? Uh-huh. Yeah. Well, the pantry cabinet definitely needs some WD40. Oh. Hi, Jordyn. Hi. Thank you. Mom, is everything okay? Yeah. I just had a little scare. Well, what was it? Um, there was a painting left at the front door. Oh, my God! That is so messed up! Jordyn, I don't want us to overreact. Overreact? You're drinking whiskey which you never do because you know something is wrong, Mom. Jordyn, I think what your mother is trying to say is that there has to be a rational explanation for this. Why are you always here? You know, it's not your house anymore. Jordyn. Stop it. Of course. Take his side. I should let you two work this out. I'm so sorry she spoke to you like that. It's okay. And thank you for coming over tonight. I'll check on you tomorrow. Okay. Hey. I couldn't sleep. Mind if I join you? I know that painting is really disturbing and I'm gonna get to the bottom of it. And sweetie, I wasn't taking his side. I just... I don't want you to be rude. Can we agree that his obsession with the house is a little strange? Well, he really loves it. And I think it's because his parents have died and doesn't have any family, so in some ways, this house is all he has left. But it's like he has no life. He's just always available to stop by. You know, he's been very helpful. I just don't trust him. Okay. Well, I do. He's been a really good friend to me. I tell you how I feel and it's... you just... it feels like you don't care. Of course I care. I'm just saying that I don't feel the same. You're just so quick to dismiss my opinions, Mom. It's like you've stopped believing in anything I've said. That is just not true. We can't catch a break. Wow. This is... disturbing. Who would've done it? I have no idea. And Jordyn's right. There's something wrong about this house. I just had such high hopes. Of course you did. I mean, we have to be comfortable in our own home. Exactly. I just wish there was a way we could resolve whatever it is going on without having to leave. You're dreading what Colin would say if you told him you're thinking of selling, aren't you? I'm just afraid he'd be disappointed. I mean, I know that's crazy for me to say but... No, no, you... you like the guy. Yeah. I guess I do. Don't worry. Everything's gonna be all right. You're the best, Lucy. Thank you. Goodnight. Yeah. Goodnight. Hmm. I love the windows in this room. Oh, it's a great room, isn't it? Yeah. Oh, thanks. Be careful. They're hot. Oh. So, an out-of-town buyer has made an offer. Huh. Twenty percent more than what you paid for this place. Wow. Wow. Why so much? Um, I don't know. I think he needs the indoor pool for physical therapy or something. But who cares? He made the offer. Sara, this is a no-brainer. Why aren't you jumping up and down? I just didn't expect something to happen so fast I guess. That's the way the real estate market works. It's feast or famine. I think you need to jump on this. Yeah. I know. It's a great offer. Just give me a day or two to think about it. Of course. No problem. Hmm. Hi. You've reached Sara Wilson's cell phone. Please leave a message and I'll call you back as soon as I can. Hey, Sara. Look, I just decided to come into the office to finish that report and I started doing research on your house just to see if there was any way to solve its mystery and well I uncovered something really interesting. Look, I'm gonna come over to tell you in person. Um, I don't know if you're out but if you are, I'll just wait. I've got the key. Okay. Sara? Hello? Who are you? I was just, uh, fixing the cabinet door. Oh. So you're Colin? I'm Sara's friend Lucy. I've heard so much about you. Um, okay. Well, I'll let you get back to what you're doing. Um, I've been dying to look around and I'm sure Sara will be back soon. Hey, Luce, I'm home. Are you here? Lucy? Hi. You've reached Lucy. I'm away from my phone, so just leave me a... There's no evidence of forced entry. She probably went out for a walk. No. She wouldn't have left me that message and then turn off her phone. And she wouldn't have asked me to wait here. And now her car is here and she's not? You're sure no one else has the house key? Besides Jordyn and I, no. Just Lucy. And you have no idea what she had to tell you about this house? None at all. She told me to wait here. And now her car... Why don't I go get you a drink, huh? Yeah, that's exactly what she needs. - Jordyn. - Let's get you a water. Okay. Thank you. Mom, are you gonna tell him? About the strange things that have been happening in this house? Come on. Weird things have been happening ever since we moved in. A couch got moved, a shadow box that was taken off of the wall. - Here you go. - Thank you. And put back on the wall. There was this disturbing painting of us that was at our front doorstep. You think someone broke in and did all that? No, it all happened at different times over the last couple of weeks. It's like someone else is living in the house with us and just doing messed up things. Okay. Start from the beginning. I'm gonna walk the periphery of the house. I mean, do you think that she could've just wandered off? No, I think someone might be getting inside the house. I'm gonna see him out. Detective. I was hoping we could have a moment in private. Okay. I'm not sure if you picked up on it but, uh, Jordyn, well, she really doesn't care much for me. Or I should say she doesn't approve of me dating her mother. And this is relevant because? Sara. She's just been under a tremendous amount of stress lately, that combined with a daughter who's, well, you know, let's just say she might not be remembering things correctly. Mr. Murray, are you telling me what I just heard was all lies? No. No, no, not lies but maybe, um, you know, unintentional exaggerations. It could be that Sara moved those things back and she just doesn't remember. You think she's delusional? No, but she has a new job and, you know, difficult teenager, a challenging ex. She's just been under a lot of strain and I just wanted you to know. Hmm. Tell me, Mr. Murray, how long have you been seeing Ms. Wilson? Oh, uh, a few weeks. A few weeks? And you feel you gained a good perspective in that small amount of time? Yes. Well, we've gotten very close. Okay. Thanks for filling me in. Now, if you'll excuse me. I'm going to check the grounds. Sure. Would you like me to stick around? I could order in food for dinner. Yeah, I don't want Jordyn and I to be alone here tonight. I just hope Lucy's okay. What if something happened to her here? This damn house. It's not the house's fault. My friend is missing. I'm just wondering when the bad things are gonna stop? I'm sorry to interrupt. But I found something. - What is it? - A small room next to the pool area. Someone's been living in there. A small room? A mattress, some clothes. Oh, and a glass that has... get this, the Prohibition Amendment written on it. What? I'm gonna need back-up at the Wilson residence. Looks like the cops are leaving. Oh, I don't wanna stay in this house tonight. I get it. - Can I stay at your place? - I wish, but my mom will definitely say no to us being together overnight. Please? My parents just won't allow it. Even if you tell them everything that happened here? But you don't wanna leave your mom here all alone. I will call first thing in the morning. Don't be mad. You and your mom will be safe tonight. Don't worry. I have patrol cars driving around the area. - We'll keep looking. - You know, before today, the two people I would've called in this situation would have been Lucy or Colin. Here's my personal cell. You hear anything, see anything, you call me. Thank you. Thank you, Detective. Come in. Noah just left. Are you okay? No. I mean, do we have to stay here tonight, Mom? Can't we go to a motel? There's some sort of conference happening in town. I checked and everything's booked up. Detective Bryant says there's officers patrolling the area. I mean, he says there's no way Colin would come back tonight. But he's obsessed with the house. Yeah. I know. But if he came back he'd be caught. Ugh. Can I sleep in here with you tonight? Of course, sweetie. Why don't you get changed? And I'll make us some tea. Okay. Thanks. What is that? Oh, my God, Lucy? Lucy! Lucy! Oh, my God, Lucy. Lucy. Oh, my God, Lucy. Okay. Hurry, before he comes back. Hurry. Hurry. That's him! He's back! Okay, go, go. Go, go, go. You run. All I wanted was to share this house with you, Sara. That's why you need to put that down, so nobody gets hurt. Okay, Colin. Colin, please. We don't wanna hurt this house, do we? I won't let them take me out of here! Please. Please, stop! No! Don't go in there! No! No! No! - Please, please. - Let go! Let go! Stop! Hey! I never meant to hurt you, Sara. I didn't leave you that painting. We could've been so happy here. Get your disgusting hands off of my mom. The police are on their way. Get out! - Mom! - Jordyn! Mommy. It's normal for criminals to deny things. He wasn't in his right mind. - Oh, thank you, sweetie. - I think what you mean to say is that my mom was not in her right mind. She could've gotten killed going after him. The important thing is you're both safe. Officers picked him up before he even made it to your front gate. And my boys did a sweep of the whole house and there's no cameras, just a lot of clever peepholes. - We'll be taking care of those. - Yeah. Well, you ladies stay put. And I'll let myself out. Well, we're gonna play hooky tomorrow. - I'll make pancakes. - Hmm. Oh, good. Lucy says the doctor doesn't think she has a concussion. - Oh. - Well, then, - we'll invite her to join us. - Uh-hmm. Hey. - Hi. - Hi. I wanted to see how you're doing. Oh, we had a really rough night actually last night, kind of unbelievable. Yeah. I know. That's why I'm here. Really? How did you hear? I have a contact down at the police department. I need to know the goings on around town, - you know, so that I can... - Oh, yeah, yeah. Well, we were fine, rattled but fine. I'm so glad you guys are okay. I was so worried. Thank you. Do you wanna come inside? Have you had the chance to consider the offer on the house? It's funny you should ask. Jordyn and I talked about it this morning. Be careful. Sorry, it is scalding hot. Oh, it's okay. After everything that's happened, I can imagine that you'd wanna leave. Yeah. You'd think, right? That's why it's so unexpected, you know, that Jordyn and I, we decided we're gonna stay. - What? - Yeah. I think this whole experience, you know, has brought us close together, and... we're gonna make our new start here. You know, like we planned, instead of running. Plus, I think it'd be really hard to find another house with the indoor pool, right? I don't know, Sara. I, uh... I think you should reconsider. My client, I mean, he just really wants this house. Oh, well, I'm sorry, Kendall, but we really wanna stay. Um... Are you okay? No, Sara, I'm not okay. I needed you to sell this house to my buyer. Don't you get it? I'm the buyer. Okay. Just put the knife down. - We can talk about this. - It's too late for that. - Hey, Mom, have you seen... - No, no, no. Jordyn! Oh! Jordyn! Oh, my God. Are you okay? She made me do it! Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Look... This is just a house, okay? Why? Why are you doing this? Mary Weather Industries, they're one of the largest conglomerates in the world. They're going to invest two billion dollars just to revitalize this area. And at the heart of their endeavor, where they plan to put their corporate campus... you guessed it. It's right here in your lovely home. So you're planning on selling our land to Mary Weather Industries? Oh. It's going to make me very rich. When you told me about all the real scary things that were going on in this house, I figured it out way before you did. I knew it was the former owner. I mean, clearly, this Colin guy couldn't let go of his home. And he even became obsessed with you in it. And, you know, I was actually worried that you would get in the way of my plan. He helped me. So the only thing I had left to do is find a way to scare you to make you finally leave. Why didn't you just explain to me that Mary Weather Industries wanted our property? I mean, the commission alone would've made you rich. The commission alone... would have given me peanuts. - Jordyn. - Mom. No! No! Mom! Mom! Jordyn. Are you okay? - Are you okay? - I'm fine, Mom. I'm so sorry that I... I stopped listening to you, and trusting you and... No. It's okay. I'm sorry for being such a brat. I love you, honey, so much. I love you, too. Are you okay? Yeah. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Okay. Let me just find a couple more of these - and I can start a fire. - Thank you, Noah. This is beautiful. I was thinking I'd collect a bunch of these, and put them in a vase at the front entrance. I love that idea. What do you guys want for dinner? Um, souffle... or coq au vin. How about some pizza? Come on, Mom.
