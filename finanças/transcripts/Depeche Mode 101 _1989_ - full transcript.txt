Erm, we're just a bit worried that the place doesn't look too empty. Is it gonna be possible to move the stage forward in the arena? HE LAUGHS Miss Beal? (Fuck off!) The band are worried that it doesn't look empty. 10,000 is still a pretty good crowd, I think. Erm, but... '..by Depeche Mode. 'Also on the bill, OMD and other bands...'

It's to remember the people who were killed in the war, isn't it? Which war? Any war. People who have... I hope it's not to celebrate the War of Independence. Come on! All the wars.

HE LAUGHS You fucked up! Oh, shit! Washington Street. OK. SYNTHESISER MUSIC PLAYS You want some history now? Yes. Well, er, it's a long story. The reason we don't have a drummer is because in the early days, it was... Well, they couldn't find a drummer. I wasn't in the band. They couldn't find a drummer. The only way that they could rehearse quietly in somebody's house at a very cheap cost was to use keyboards with headphones. We used to use a four-track tape recorder. We used to sit it in the middle of the stage like a drummer. We didn't want people thinking we were trying to hide the fact. For now, the tape machine has moved to the side of the stage. It's basically the same way we first started. The keyboard has a total of 36 different banks. Each song has its own set of sounds. On Black Celebration I've got several sounds allocated to specific parts of the keyboard. The first sound is... DESCENDING BASS EFFECT PLAYS The next sound I have to play is further up on the keyboard... JANGLY ECHO EFFECT PLAYS ...which is just that. So then I can put the two together HE PLAYS TWO KEYBOARD EFFECTS Later on, I have to play a melodic harp. MELODIC HARP EFFECT PLAYS And so on. You're only limited by what you can manage with your hands. As far as the sound goes... You've got to remember where you put them. That comes after a while. It gets to be automatic. Your hands just go there. Do you ever forget? Of course. These are linked to this keyboard. All you have to do is imagine that these two pads here are extra keys on the keyboard. When I hit that pad, it's the same process as if I was playing a key on the keyboard. CLANGING INDUSTRIAL EFFECT He said if I let my hair go black, he wouldn't go out with me any more. Not true. Yes, true! If you let it... If I let it go back. to a different colour, he wouldn't go out with me any more. Now, my hair's falling out cos I bleach it all the time just to make him happy. HAIRDRYER WHIRS Hello? So you're gonna have a bald wife. He'll love me bald. Always. SHE LAUGHS Are you going to get married? I hope not. We're gonna have ten kids. Whether she likes it or not. Very funny! They're going to grow up totally normal. Doesn't it look neat? It's short on this side and then it goes whoo! She looks pretty. That looks nice. Thank you. It's... It's there. Do you want any more? Darling, I love you. Let's go now. Forget it. Yes, darling, dearest, love of my life! I hate him. I really do. Things You Said first.

The bus is going like this and there's a horrible smell. There was a smell? I've never thrown up like that before. Never! Don't look at me like that! Jay was over here. He was over here, too. Oh, Jay was over here, too. Much exaggeration on this. Where are we going today, do you know? Oh, Graceland, probably, right? Oh, that's right. What's Graceland? What? What's Graceland? What's Graceland? Yeah. Graceland is where Elvis lived. Oh, really? (Boring!) Elvis. What did you say? I said boring. Boring? I said Elvis, I said boring. Hello there. How's everything? I'd like to express my great thanks to you for peeing all over the toilet seat. Really, thank you. You know why I did that? Really, though, thank you. Very much. We can't explain that on camera either. I can explain that. He was standing five feet away in order to go to the bathroom. Why? Challenge. It was a challenge. Yeah. Did you meet the challenge, Oliver? Not really. Not really. I sort of missed. I bent it and it was like... You bend it. It didn't bend a lot. "Billy Bob was here!" Really, look at this! Billy Bob! It's in French! You know French! I know how to say I'm bored in French. Can you read that? Wow! I arrived on... I arrived from Quebec. Non-stop... ...on American Airlines. On American Airlines, it was a bumpy flight and I'm sorry I came because this place sucks. Pretty mean to write in French. Terrible! We're in detention, would I pay 12 bucks to see that house more than I'd pay 12 to see this house? I would. INAUDIBLE QUESTION No, I have no idea. I know they live in east London, right? That's about it. That's all I know. No idea. When they die, we'll get to see! OK, wait a minute. OK, ready? Figured I'd look it up in the French dictionary and Depeche Mode means "We play butt naked." LAUGHTER No clothes on. What sort of dictionary are you looking at? That sounds good, though, we'll have that one. Depeche Mode. No, somebody called the other day and said Depeche Mode means "fast fashion". Is that right? Yeah. That's us. That's us! Do you mind taking some calls and see what's on everybody's mind here? Let's start on our toll-free number here. Hello, go ahead. Hello! Yes. Go ahead. 'Do you like to sweat onstage?' Do you like to sweat onstage? There's a question. Last night, Dave reckons, was the hottest concert we've ever played. It was open air. But I still didn't get a bead of sweat. Didn't you? I don't move, it's all right for us. We're keyboard players, we don't move! He's had implants. 'Can I ask another question?' Yeah, go ahead, real quick. 'I will sing for tickets.' You'll sing what? 'I will sing People Are People.' Get out! You've got to sing a harder song than that! 'Can I sing?' Go ahead. 'I can sing?' Yeah, go ahead. ♪ People are people so why does it seem... ♪ What? ♪ ..You and I can get along so awfully? ♪ Not bad, not bad. You got three of the words right! LAUGHTER So we're on the right phone? OK. OK, don't go away this time, Mark. OK, one more time, here's Andy. Mark? Hi. Very good. I finally can contact you. What? The Alternative Dance Party From Hell. Right. I'll have to get this. Hi, this is Andy Fletcher of Depeche Mode and you're listening to Mark Hill on The Alternative Dance Party From Hell. Not much, really. I'm just... My job is to keep everyone together, really. Martin's the songwriter, Alan's the good musician, Dave's the vocalist. And I bum around. DJs. We're not big fans of DJs, generally, like radio DJs and things. But I shouldn't really say that, you know. I'm supposed to be doing promotion here! No, but, it's not... There's definitely certain areas where we suffer through lack of radio support. We've just been to places like Nashville, for instance. Most places in the country, we were playing to 10-15,000 people. In Nashville, we get about 2,000 people along. Which we were pleased with in the end because ticket sales weren't very good until the last day. And in that area, it seems that nobody at all is playing our music. I mean, because of their background, it doesn't surprise us that much, but... I think we know there is an audience there. It seems that wherever we get radio play, we immediately do well. That's nice sounding, that. That one's 450, but it's not as nice sounding. HE PLAYS BLUES RIFF They're early, though, aren't they? A couple of Roy Orbison ones. Roy Orbison. Roy Orbison? Where's Roy Orbison? 20 Early Classics. I do want Roy Orbison. 20 Early Classics. You like country music? A little bit. I'm finally getting into it so I thought I might come and buy some today. Do you like bluegrass? Which one do you like better? Don't know enough about it. Don't know much about it? I'm just getting into it. I'm just going to give you a good old country sticker here. This is our card. When you get back home, if you'd like to order through the mail from us, write to us. All right, thank you. Good crowd later. Wow. We'll see tonight. Yeah. I don't think so.

Standby to blackout. Out! Would the band have a collective identity where it could be... Like Depeche Mode talking as opposed to... An individual? Yeah. Umm... Well, you know, we're all very individual, actually. Right. When was the last time you had a fistfight? Let's say I asked you that. I haven't actually been... Oh, I don't know. Andre will probably tell you that. In Austria with that cabbie! Oh, yeah, cab driver, yeah. Yeah. That was a real intense situation as well. It was he and you? Just the two of you? Yeah. I assume he... I was actually beating him up in the car when he was driving. Yeah. Really? You couldn't have won, could you? No, it was actually... I can't even remember why it happened. Oh, I know why! Because he was... This guy was just crazy. He was driving at about 90mph, screeching around every corner. He peeled out when we sort of first drove away from the club, he ran through red lights and we were like... And then I just started saying to him, "Slow down, what's going..." You know. He was really weird. He just sort of said things like, "Look, I'm driving the car." And he was a cabbie! He was supposed to be, like, driving us around. So I just started, you know, beating him and stuff, yeah. And I ended up actually hanging on to the door like this when he was still sitting in the car. I opened the door and I was kicking him like this. Hanging on the car and kicking him! And then afterwards... And then the guy got out of the car. And he was like this big. At least, right? And he was like this. And I went, "Oh." And then he just... His trousers fell down! He started getting really... He was so big and fat and his trousers fell down, he didn't have a belt on. And then he couldn't run or anything, he couldn't do anything. So Andre just pushed him over he just fell over. It does get to the point sometimes where you feel you could actually kill someone. I mean, I don't think you would... I certainly wouldn't do it, I don't think, I'm not sure, I'm not sure, actually. But there's certainly been times within the band, when we've been arguing, that I've felt possibly I could kill someone. What, the tech? Yeah, possibly. You know. But then afterwards, you calm down and you've let all that energy out it's OK. It's letting off some of that built-up energy and tension that you just... It's not even enough for you to let out on stage. Even when you're doing that, that's not enough. You've still got more. And that's sometimes like a release. And that was definitely a release, you know. I'd been looking for a fight for a good few days. Turn it down, turn it down, please. Up yours! HE TURNS VOLUME DOWN Don't ever talk to a member of the band like that again, Harold, otherwise you're finished. I thought we'd just get a few things...

I had real problems with the sound at first, it was so hard, my vocal was so hard. I think when it's like that, you tend to, I don't know why, you sing out more because there's no actual beef. If it's loud, you can't hear because it's so... I didn't realise how loud it was on the stage. Yeah. It was really loud tonight, yeah. Yeah, onstage. But also we had a couple of days off, you know, I'm feeling really tired at the moment, so that's probably a lot to do with it as well. But it's nowhere near as bad as what it was in San Francisco. I couldn't even speak then. But tonight I have to do my steroids and stuff, puffer, I'm going to do that tonight again. The stuff that the doctor gave me in San Francisco. It's like a puffer. You know like what somebody who has asthma attacks uses? It's steroids. So it straight away hits your vocal chords and... Peps them up? Peps them up, yeah.

It was more fun in the supermarket? Yeah. A lot less pressure as well. It doesn't make a difference, you make more money, but the pressure gets big as well. So at the end of the day they're the same.

Art is a feeling, it's gut feeling. Yeah! Well, fashion illustration is a gut feeling too. What you get when you draw a woman's body and you add colour and shape. I can understand drawing a woman's body. Or a man's body. Putting trendy clothes on her is not my idea of... But you don't necessarily have to do trendy things. No? No. I don't consider that art. You don't consider the human body art? No, the body, yes, absolutely, the exaggeration of form is definitely art. But the fashion end of it is a different story altogether. That's the whole point of it. What's fashion to what...? So it's a trend, it's people trying to look like something they're not, they're just like. I mean... No, no! It's an art, in a way it is. It's an art form. Let me see you draw an outfit, OK. Design an outfit, cut it and sew it and make it look just like the picture you drew. That's not from within yourself, copying something. You consider art something that cannot be copied over and over again. That's not true, look at Lichtenstein. The way you're talking it sounds like something that's original. When you design a jacket you have to make copies of it so you can sell it. Fashion design is an art form and a business. When you like what you do, it's great. But if you're not making money how are you going to pay for everything, how will you get things in life? That's whoring yourself. But I'm saying going within yourself and taking out something that is so beautiful, like a rose, like dew on a rose in the morning. That's something that you've got to capture. Excuse me? What if it's not beautiful? What's not beautiful? What's inside yourself! It doesn't matter, if you're expressing yourself, that's beauty within itself. But it is within yourself cos you're using your creativity. You're using it to make money, money's not important. What are you going to live on? Love? It can't make you happy. You can live on love, there's no doubt about it. You're going to be a bum! No, you're not going to be a bum, you just marry rich! You just went against everything you just said! I didn't, that has nothing to do with art, marrying a rich girl. That's just a pleasant thing, you have to live somehow!

I mean, I'm sorry, Oliver. No, the reason I say hat is because it makes the ends break off the more she does it. Oh, so you're standing behind my back telling her what to say, aren't you? Little... Don't wear the hat cos you look ridiculous, it will be too much, it will be too overpowering for the outfit. I'd personally do something with your hair, that's fine.

You're going to see my routine that I've gone through now 100 times on this tour. Who was it? Alan Plankerton. Bit tense tonight. A lot of problems on stage. All the keyboards... We're working with no back-up. Usually we have back-up and now there's nothing because the main ones, the main ones have gone out with the heat. If anything else fails we can tell the audience to be quiet and get the two acoustics out, right?! And someone is stuck with nothing to play, you've just got to whip one out. All right. Get out of here. Get out of here, move back, right now! Where are we? Lost. THEY LAUGH We'll get there for the last song. We're going to die, we are! In Arizona! Watch that pedestrian, Dave!

After everything else, we've had nothing but grief in this whole place with the roof and everything has been late. Everything that we've tried to do has been late. We've had problems with everything. We've had keyboards blowing up, the lot. And now as the final straw, we've been told we've got to finish everything an hour early. It's a great problem and we're doing everything that we can. We will limit our sound check, do everything that's within our grasp to finish it and keep the noise to a minimum, but that's all I can do at the moment, I'm afraid. Hello. You're doing fine! SCREAMING AND CHEERING Two black or white? I'd like two white shirts. These? 23 each, OK? How much? 23. OK, 26. Thank you. Can help you? Just two posters. Two posters? 20. Thank you. OK, who's next? Ironic, isn't it? Tell me this, what made you decide to do this? I mean, when I first heard it, I mean, a lot of people I'm sure went, "God that is a real risk for this band, "I mean, can they draw 70,000 people?" You go through phases of like, being really, really tired and really fed up and wanting to go home and then you feel good for a month or so. You're up and down, but we're feeling good at the moment, even though it's the end and also a bit sad, you know. Usually with people we like we can work with them closely. And without being dictated to by a higher, you know, officials. So... You've got to have a seat. I do have a seat. You've got to go before the show starts. OK. Hello, Pasadena. No, I don't think I should say Pasadena. I've been thinking about this. It's been playing on my mind. I think I should say... Dave, I wouldn't let it play on your mind! I think I should say, "Good evening, everybody." No, that sounds terrible, everybody. Hello. Try it Newark, New Jersey, see what that. Hello, people. Why not say, good evening, welcome to a concert for the masses. Who do you think I am, fucking Wordsworth? I'll write it down for you. What was it again? Concert, everyone, you evening masses. Good evening, concert, masses, everybody, people, Pasadena! Fucked that right up, didn't I? Write it on your shirt. I'll get Darren. Get Paul down there. Get Paul. We'll put on the back of Andre's shirt, OK, so he can come on and do it like that, you can have it, good evening, everybody. Hello! TALK OVER EACH OTHER And what shall I say? I'm serious.

I haven't even started counting. I want to tell him the T-shirts sold out. In two seconds! This is ridiculous. 85,000 and 75. This is hysterical. Ridiculous. Imagine how much money they raked in tonight. That's the question. How much money they made. You figure 23 shirts and 28... No, 32 sweatshirts, something like that. 32? And how much were the programmes? I don't know. 5, 10 bucks or so? Phew! I'd love to be their accountant. 1,000 for T-shirts. Do you have any idea what that is? Does anyone know, besides me looking at the invoice? I have no idea. No. I don't know. We should ask Jose. We can ask him what it's for. Add it to their wardrobe tonight. I don't know. Here it is. What is it? 1,000. Jose enterprises! LAUGHTER It's for 96 pass t-shirts, silver T-shirts. Who's wearing silver T-shirts? No idea. I didn't get one. Let's ask, can we ask Jose Productions?

I want to put something in. Yeah. For field. OK? I mean, because in the contract, we're responsible for re-sodding the field if there are any damages to it. I want to put something in. What do you want to put in for damage? I'd put in 5,000. Let's put half in. No, I think we need to have it in. This is one of the few places where you really get hit with this. Jonathan, let's remember one thing. This building was not our choice. This was Wayne's and the band's choice. This was the band's choice cos they told Wayne... They wanted an event. ...they want to play where nobody's played and I said, "Wayne, nobody's played the Rose Bowl since 1982 "when Peace Sunday was here for Steve Wonder and Jackson Brown." You know? We have a lot more costs. It's the most expensive building in town. Buildings that we want to bill, the band said "We want to play there." Five grand for damage?! Look at... Read that contract. We're responsible. I read it, I was just looking at it. Five grand.

Everything else was horrendous. Did they sound... What did they sound like out front? They were... How can you describe them? I hope you puts lots of reverb on. Yeah, you do, but the thing is, in that sort of place, the vocals always come over extra dry. You can wet them and wet them, they still sound clear. Did you notice that, at all?
