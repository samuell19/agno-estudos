The Malay Peninsula, late in the 15th century. A time when loyalty, honor, and sovereignty prevailed. Malacca, renowned for her power and her glory, was known throughout the world. At this moment, the story begins. Two lovers, separated by distance and worldly position, sealing a promise to be together. Across the oceans and over the mountains, a legendary tale of the greatest love. When the time comes, we will be together. I'll take that as a promise. My dream? To live on Mount Ledang. Should you not return, I'll come to you. When the time comes, we will be together. I will take that as a promise. I seek love. I will come to you. I love lush greenery. My dream is to live on Mount Ledang. I swear… Should you not return, I will come to you. It is a sign. I must go to him. MAJAPAHIT TERRITORY I want to be part of his dreams. Someday soon, we will surely be together. He will come to me. Have you really thought this through? I have made up my mind, Mbok. Tomorrow I shall take you to Malacca, to Mount Ledang. MALACCA Hurry! He who is swift achieves. He who is slow despairs! Now hear this! Denied his heart's desire, he lives like a buffalo. So hurry! The swift achieve. The slow despair. Hey! You! Come with me. Father? Your daughter will marry our leader. Just give your blessing now! Father? Forgive me. I cannot do this. Don't take my child. Take your money back. Old fool! Help me. You gave your word! Stop! I'll come. Hurry up! Father! No one should have to do anything against their will. Who said that? Who said that? It is my duty to take this girl to my leader. This is not your concern, sir. Everything that happens in Malacca is my concern. Let her go. Love cannot be forced. Those are my orders! What if they were yours, lord admiral? To follow, be sensible. To obey, be wise. MALACCA BEACH Look again. Don't leave anything behind. If the winds of Malacca blow strong, news of your arrival will surely reach his ears. I'm doing what's right. I'm doing what's right. MAJAPAHIT TERRITORY Prime minister. It's like balancing an urn full of oil. MALACCA PALACE Everything is in order. MOUNT LEDANG, MALACCA Mbok… Your blessings and dedication will be my strength. Everyone, get ready to depart! Allow me to stay with the princess. There's no need. The princess isn't alone. Come, let us return to Java. His Royal Highness Regent Crown Prince Ahmad. At the pleasure of His Majesty the Sultan, the coronation of Prince Ahmad, His Majesty's son, first in line to inherit the Kingdom of Malacca, will now commence. As fragrant and pure as rose water and jasmine, so shall be the rule of the crown prince over Malacca. With this royal kris of the regent, thus is bestowed the title of crown prince, the rightful heir to the Sultanate of Malacca. The five-petaled emblem that adorns the young prince's headdress symbolizes the coronation as blessed with the sultan's consent. It was worth your sacrifices, Your Majesty. Your son is now the crown prince. Crown prince, first in line… MAJAPAHIT TERRITORY His Highness Gusti Adipati is ready to receive Prince Benowo of Demak. In the name of Allah, the benevolent and the merciful, the sultan of Demak extends to you, Gusti Adipati, ruler of Majapahit Territory, his offer of protection. Demak guarantees peace and security of your people and your kingdom. The sultan of Demak… guarantees my security? My security. From what threat? It is Demak who needs protection! Run! Demak's army is attacking! Run! We will fight Demak to the bloody end! He who threatens the sanctity of this land will taste the wrath of the sword! It is obvious Demak's followers are increasing by the day. To go into battle now is to set a date with death. We may be of a different faith from them, but if you, Gusti Adipati, would so allow, our princess… can be offered in marriage to bridge our two kingdoms. Only then… Only at that moment will we have peace. My younger sister? The foundation Of matrimony Is not about material Or physical Love from the heart Is… The… Principal I'm about to lose it! What kind of disrespect is this? A lowly servant, to whom I have given shelter dares stab me in the back? Tell me, prime minister. I am merely… Should I kill her? Is beheading punishment enough? What should be the right punishment for lowly servants who commit treason? Damnation! What evil has possessed her? It seems to me, prime minister, this woman is courting death! Your Divine Highness. My only duty and purpose in life is to serve. That is all I have done, Your Highness. Ask her, prime minister. Ask her… why she influenced the princess to leave Majapahit? Ask her! Forgive me, Your Majesty Gusti Adipati. In the name of the Lord of Creation, I only sought to aid Gusti Puteri to find happiness. That is the oath I made to Her Royal Highness. I accept whatever the consequences are for helping the princess follow her heart and her dreams. Your Royal Highness… I will personally kill those dreams! MALACCA His Highness Gusti Adipati of Majapahit is at the palace gates! Lord admiral. Lord Mayor. His Highness Gusti Adipati and I await an audience with His Majesty. Matters concerning his sister, Gusti Puteri. I wonder what it is about. Gusti Adipati. The peace of my kingdom is under threat because of you! My sister's love for you will bring nothing but trouble. If it were not for the sultan of Malacca, I would have slaughtered you! If it were not for the sultan of Malacca… Lord admiral! Gusti Adipati… His Royal Highness the Sultan awaits the pleasure of your company. This way, please. I think it would be wiser, Lord admiral, if you do not join us. Your Majesty… After carefully considering the proposal, our renowned and beloved sultan graciously consents to fulfill the hopes of the people of Majapahit to take the princess, Gusti Putri Retno Dumilah, sister of Gusti Adipati Handaya Ningrat, as his queen. -Long live the sultan! -Long live the sultan! An excellent suggestion, don't you think, my lord admiral? Your Majesty. Anything that Your Majesty wishes gives me the greatest pleasure. Your Majesty. Prime minister, begin the preparations. Your wish is my command, Your Majesty. Pray that with this marriage, the Kingdom of Malacca can put an end to Demak's attack, Your Highness. First, resolve the matter of Tuah. His presence only inflames the situation. See to it. I am doing this as my duty. That's not your real intention. I know you too well. Isn't our marriage a duty too? My beloved brother, Gusti Adipati, why have you forsaken me? Why have you gone straight to the sultan? Would you have welcomed me? What kind of a woman are you? In your position, to debase your dignity and chase a man so beneath your station? Have you lost your mind? What wrong have I committed? I have decided to follow my heart, before I lose everything else. Is this wrong? Follow your heart? Since when did the Royal Princess of Java have the right to follow her heart? That is treason! Your blood courses through my veins too, my darling sister. Our blood belongs to our land. But as fate has dictated, you found your way here. We all have our dreams, sister, but the reality is we have our responsibilities too. Do not fight the destiny we are born to fulfill. Why shouldn't I? Why can't I fight against the life I never wanted and never chose? Enough! Stop dreaming of love. Marry the sultan of Malacca, sister. Help bring peace to our people. Or have you forsaken them and your own country? But if I marry the sultan of Malacca, then every day I will have to face the man I truly love, Tuah. I couldn't bear it. I would rather give myself to Prince Demak for the sake of my people. If Malacca allows the princess, Gusti Puteri, to marry Prince Demak… it'd be like smearing coal on our faces. If Your Majesty would allow, I would like to humbly offer this suggestion. Forgive me, Your Majesty. The Lord Admiral, Your Majesty, is our only hope. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. At His Majesty's command, on behalf of His Royal Highness the Sultan of Malacca, I bring an invitation to Prince Benowo of Demak to the royal wedding of the sultan to Gusti Putri Retno Dumilah, Princess of Majapahit. Forgive me, but from what I hear, that's not the case. This Taming Sari kris is a witness to the invitation I brought, prince. I accept the invitation because the messenger is the honorable lord admiral of Malacca. But if what we have heard is proven true, in God's truth… Demak will attack Majapahit! Can a woman such as me pose any danger to the honorable lord admiral of Malacca? Or do you fear my touch will stir your soul? My actions have not been made in haste. Everything has been arranged to prevent unwanted problems. My lord, I will try my very best. It's my job to see Malaccan hearts soothed. Is everything in order, Lord Setia? Yes, sir. Seven trays in all. When is the proposal delegation departing, prime minister? After dawn prayers tomorrow, Your Majesty. Tun Mamat will head the delegation. It would please me greatly if Lord Admiral Tuah led the delegation. Forgive me, Your Majesty. Perhaps it would be best at a time like this, Your Majesty, if the lord admiral stayed with me. My marriage to the princess cannot be delayed any longer. I have promised Java. If you so wish, Your Majesty. Lord admiral? I am at your service, Your Majesty. Lord admiral, your loyalty to Malacca… is truly unquestionable. His Royal Highness the Sultan gives leave for the departure of this regal delegation conveying with them the royal ensign. Tuah wouldn't want me to marry his sultan. Or would he? What is it, my lord admiral? Grandmother. Who are you? And… what are you doing alone in this forest? I live here, my child. My name is Tun Mamat. Have you seen the princess? Oh, yes. When? Where? By the waterfall, in the east. The princess is always there… when I go by. We're actually on our way to see her on the mountain, with a marriage proposal. And my name is Lord Setia. Marriage proposal from whom? The sultan of Malacca, Sultan Mahmud. Be very careful when you cross the ocean, lest the waters change to fiery flames. We're at His Majesty's service. Well, good for you, my child. Your loyalty is infinite… Endless. My love. How I long to see you, my love. Do you not wish to meet me too? Feel the wrath of the flying machete. I think we should move to a safer place. You're right. Listen, everyone! Let's move now. Gather your things and be quick about it. We are now bound together by this foot-cleansing ritual. Every step away from you brings my heart two steps closer to you. I solemnly vow… should you not return, I will come to you. To walk on the land you walk on. To breathe the air you breathe. Set sail on a winding trail. Cast an anchor in the heart of calm. Heavy is the heart that stays. Sad is the soul that strays. But when the time does come, we will be as one. Are we ready, Lord Setia? Yes. Ready, lord admiral. Very well. Shall we… Just a moment, lord admiral. The prime minister instructed me to meet with the princess alone. But why? My orders come from the sultan. The prime minister requested I convey this message. It is all for the good of His Majesty… and the lord admiral. But His Majesty the Sultan has asked me to go instead, and I intend to obey his orders. Have you waited long? Yes, my love. Here you are, walking on the land I walk on. The phoenix's broken wings brought you here? For love, no mountain is too high. So here we are together on the mountain. It feels like a dream to hear you speak these words of love. Your voice frees the yearning in my heart. I feel a gust of wind piercing my chest. Why is my love being put to such a terrible test? I had forgotten how majestic your love is. And your love, is it as boundless? Tiny in comparison to yours, my dearest. And yet, here you are. A wretch driven mad by thirst, waiting at the edge of a well. You have kept your promise. Love… I have come bearing high hopes, of which you may be aware. Oh, please… tell me please you're not here only on the sultan's orders. My love… There is no other love for me apart from you, my dearest. My love is higher than this mountain. It is bigger than my very being. Bigger than your very being? High above in the sky? But alas… My hands are tied to the sky… My feet, bound to the earth. Reality does not measure up to dreams. I am content just to live in hope. Oh, my love, please forget these orders. It is your love I long for… and nothing else. Do you know how happy I am now just to be reunited with you? It seems time has numbed your heart. You come to me with hurtful intentions. Excuse me, Your Highness. Your humble servant Tun Mamat and the lord admiral sincerely hope Gusti Puteri will accept the sultan's proposal of marriage. It will break our hearts to return to our beloved sultan without you, Gusti Puteri, as his queen. Is that true, lord admiral? Does your silence mean it's true? Are you unaware that I have already accepted Prince Demak's proposal? Gusti Puteri… Demak's proposal has no relevance now. Lord Admiral Hang Tuah himself traveled to Java to inform Prince Demak of the sultan's intention to propose. No matter what happens, Tuah will never change. Very well. If that is your wish… I accept. I accept the proposal… as long as these conditions are met. What do these Javanese words mean? There's still no news from Malacca, Your Highness. Do you think, prime minister, there will still be obstacles? Do you mean Tuah? Just as the sun rises… and illuminates everything with its rays… have faith in the almighty, Your Highness. Like a river that leads to the sea… you have influenced my sister. You have manipulated her. You have destroyed all my hopes and dreams, you worthless, disgraceful creature. Your words are sharp and uncouth and they detract from your nobility. They're not as sharp as my sword, Tuah! You've brought danger and unrest to my country. You've trampled on the dignity of my people. Damn you, Tuah! We shall see who is more powerful! I am not intimidated by a… mere Malay! Stay out of this, all of you. Prepare to meet your end! No… Your death will not bring me solace. Inform His Majesty the Sultan… I have failed in executing his orders… And that I am deeply ashamed to appear before him. This I vow… As long as the Taming Sari rests in the bed of this river, I shall not return. You fight for yourself… I fight for my people and my country. Forgive me, my lord prime minister. I realize this has resulted from my failure to stop the lord admiral… Thank you. I'm sure you are feeling very tired. Perhaps it is best that you go home. Just because of this… Tuah feels he has failed me? Oh, Tuah. His loyalty knows no bounds. His departure proves it. Prime minister… Your Majesty. Go and find Tuah, and persuade him to return to Malacca. Your wish is my command… Your Majesty. Begin the engagement ceremony. Gather all the wise men of Malacca. The proposal conditions have been received. There are seven in all. You will never change, Tuah. First, the tears of a young girl. Seven urns full. The answer is… seven urns of tears from a virgin. Second… The betel nut. It marries not because it is unripe, red is its blood. Seven urns in all. The answer is seven urns of young betel nut juices. Third… Crawling freely on the fields, blood is its desire. In its nature. Seven trays full. The answer is seven trays filled with hearts of mites. Which land am I standing on? Here I kneel, a man who failed in love. What kind of sand is in my grasp? My arms are getting weak. Flowers bloom, the land is vast… Yet I am… alone… Fourth, it flies freely in the air. Blood, too, is its desire. The essence… Seven trays in all. The answer is seven trays of mosquito hearts. Fifth… The white blood of the people to link the royal blood from the foot to the crown. The answer is a silver bridge from Malacca to the peak of Mount Ledang. Sixth… The red blood of the people to link the royal blood from the foot to the crown. The answer is… a golden bridge from Malacca to the peak of Mount Ledang. Seventh… A case of blood flowing still. The body waits its turn. A bowlful. The answer is… The blood of my son. Forgive me, Your Majesty. The proposal demands are easily fulfilled and inconsequential compared to your eminence, Your Highness. The renown and magnitude of your royal stature are greater than these demands. How do you measure the value of the crown prince's life… against that of the Javanese people? Then again, what value can be placed on the lives of the Javanese when they are not under Malacca's rule? When it's only to fulfill a condition for your marriage, Your Highness. Forgive me, Your Majesty. Forgive me. Let it be known to all… my task is not just to give orders. My son? Or… Java? This is all too painful. Like swallowing bile. Like poison seeping into my soul. Yet, it will not stop me! Your Majesty. To sacrifice for love is divine. To sacrifice for one's country is indeed noble. But where is the honor in sacrifice if one's hands are tainted with the blood of an innocent? Is Your Majesty prepared to do so? Perhaps you don't understand that these conditions are in fact… a refusal? Is this some kind of game? I'm prepared to sacrifice for your people and you belittle my efforts? How dare you… make a fool of me, when I am willing to protect the sovereignty of your kingdom. Your intention is noble, Your Majesty. But does it come from the heart? I have already made a decision to return to Java to marry Prince Demak. Why is Your Highness stopping me? Do you realize who you are talking to? I am not one of your lowly subjects whom you can treat in any way you wish. My lowly subjects? The same lowly people for whom you were prepared to sacrifice your son, the crown prince? Are there any among you who have wondered why I have come to this country? I followed my heart. That is my right. The right of every human being. The right to choose. I don't want to wither away in the palace. I want to be free. Free to love… and be loved. Not to belittle Malacca. If Malacca's greatness lies in your hands, why do you need this marriage to save my country? You speak without reasoning. You forget the land of Malacca is sacred. The slightest wound, the smallest disrespect I suffer, is felt by all of Malacca. I am grieved by your harsh words. I only wish… to live on the peak of Mount Ledang… to avoid causing hurt to anyone. Grant me this, Your Majesty. I grant your wish. However… your actions are still treasonous. And as surely as the land of Malacca is sacred, you will remain alone atop Mount Ledang, never to be seen by anyone after dawn. For whoever lays eyes on you, a curse be upon him. He will vomit blood and die a painful death! The sovereignty of Malacca is truly great. But what a shame Your Majesty has chosen to misuse it. Long live Your Majesty! May Your Highness reign until the end of time. How sweet is love's sacrifice? And when dawn breaks, whoever lays his eyes on her will vomit blood and die a bloody death. Lord admiral, I trust you understand and appreciate how hard I've tried to prevent all this. It only serves to remind us all that we can make plans for our lives, but our fate lies… not in our hands. What is all this sacrifice for, Tuah? A love so beautiful… had to be sacrificed. Go. Go now… before it is too late. Come. Let us return to the palace. Show yourself, my love! Show yourself! I'd suffer the curse and die rather than live without you. For all that you have sacrificed, for all that you have suffered, and for all the things I should have done, please forgive me, my love. I was blind, love! I beg you, my love. I beg you. Forgive me, my love. If you allow me to walk on this land and breathe the same air with every beat of your heart… give me a sign. Please give me a sign. Truly… I love you. I have gone to great lengths and lost so much to find true love. Your love, like the rays of the sun warming my face, fleeting though it may be, will live on forever in my heart and soul. I love you too, Tuah. A love supreme yet unrealized forever becomes immortalized. Like a yearning moon that circles the Earth, in her glow, she illuminates the darkness. Since then, there has been no word. Of the lovers, nothing is heard. But Mount Ledang remains through time, a symbol of a love so fine. The sacrifice of love divine.
