What are you guys doing here? Where did, Mina, Rina and Tina go? They have all gone to hell. You have made us sweat in winter. You make our lives miserable! Lives in the real world friend and stop dreaming! You nerds just spoilt my day. It was such a beautiful dream... ...it was about to make my day. Do you only keep thinking about girls the whole day? Of course or should i think about you? Girls are a gift from heaven. I like someane's cheeks or her hair. I like someone's gait, her eyes or her figure. By the way where's our friends Arjun and Azgar? They have been beaten up; and now are in the hospital. Where did this trouble come from? Who did this? That girl is like a like a butcher number 1. Look, she has bitten aff his nose, broken his arms... ... and almost castrated this guyll!! She has bashed me every where. How did you become Kamala from Kamal? She kicked me so hard, every thing was lost. I was a man. My gender has been changed. Who is this girl? Who dared to do this? I am the one; speak with me. Yes! There is something about you that i like! You look delicious. Shut up! I won't toletate any nonsense from you. Maybe i will eat you up raw! Even the air dare not touch me; what are you? Wow! I have seen many, but none like you!... ... You are so full of pride and ego... Without your wish, even the wind can't touch you. But tomorrow i will kiss you in front of everyone. " The heart says go fall in love..." "... Let your eyes meet a beautiful girl's eyes." " The heart says go fall in love..." "... Let your eyes meet a beautiful girl's eyes." " Your open locks and your anklets..." " Your eyes have wounded my heart..." " Some are Romeo and some Juliet..." " Some are Romeo and some Juliet, some smart, some smarter." " This young feeling is the first such..." " Some are Romeo and some Juliet..." " Some are Romeo and some Juliet, some smart, some smarter." " This young feeling is the first such..." " Some will come close to you; some will steal your heart." " Some will capture you in her eyes; some will just smile." " Make yourself restless in love..." " Let your eyes meet a beautiful girl's eyes." " Your open locks and your beautiful eyes have wounded my heart." " Come on everybody!" " The heart says go fall in love..." " Let your eyes meet a beautiful girl's eyes." " The heart says go fall in love..." " Let your eyes meet a beautiful girl's eyes." " Your open locks and your ringing anklets..." " Your eyes have wounded my heart..." " Your open locks and your ringing anklets..." " Your eyes have wounded my heart..." No! My son can't do something like this. He has done it in front of the entire college. He's here, ask him. Mom! - Okay, you go. Mom! Mom! Mom! Mom. I have sung a super duper song and i am sure to win the trophy. I am sure you will, but right now you have brought home a medal. What kind of medal Mom? A medal of shame and disgrace. What's up between you both... ... that you kissed her in front of the entire college? Tell me ! It was nothing Mom. Shut up and listen to me, from now on you will stay away from girls. But why Mom? Because i am ordering you to do so, and i dare you to disobey me. Come on, i have grown up and can fall in love with anyone. Then it will be the last day of my life; and you will see my dead face. Don't say that, Mom. Mom, i'll do whatever you wish, Mom. You are all i have. Please don't talk about separating from me ever. I swear by you Mom, i will never again look up at any girl. Dear brother sister- in - law, i have brought up your son like my own. I have compelled him to be disciplined... ... so that i can live up to my promise. I've waited 20 years to fulfill that promise, so that i can pay back... ... with the same coin; and seek justice for the reason of your death. I wouldn't have been so strict with Kishen, if Raju had been here. You all wait here, while. I drink some water. " Who is he... Who is he " " Who is he, who comes in my dreams, and steals my sleep... " " ... and increases my heart beat, who is he? " " Who is he... Who is he " " I am your quest, sweetheart, i am your love. Come embrace me... " " ... for i am the one you seek. " " I am your quest, sweetheart, i am your love." " Who is he, who casts a spell on my mind, embraces me in his heart... " " ... and makes me crazy, who is he? " Who is he... " " Like a petal of flower, lost in time, " " Somebody tell me how does he look? " " I am your color; you are my mirror... " " Without you i am nothing. " " Without you.... " " Who is he, who beckons me, " " Embraces me in his body and soul... " " ... and creates magic for me, who is he? " " Who is he... " Were you hiding and watching me? Yes! No! No! I will show you, just wait! You loafer! You loafer, take this you peeping tom! Wait aunty, please don't! You scoundrel ! I won't spare you, scoundrel ! Hey aunty, listen, she was having a... ... bath in the falls and i went to see her. Waren't you having a bath in the falls? I thought she was drying her hair, which i pulled and you came out. And in all this, i turned into this. I see, you both are involved, and you look a lovely pair. Aunty we are not involved, i have seen her for the first time today. I don't even know her. When you don't even know me, then why were you searching for me? To see if this was a dream or for real. Now you know i am for real and not a dream. Brother Raju, there's trouble. What happened? All your cattle have entered the land lord's field. What will happen now? You will have to give an explanation to the local council. Sit down. Why are you sitting, you are the culprit. My child come sit. Raju, your cattle have spoiled all my harvest, give an ecplanation. Now did your cattle enter our field? Sir, first she came, then she came, then where she went i don't know. Where she went, i went after her, but she was not there. She was there. Then she came after me. Had she not come this wouldn't have happened. Sir, first she came, then she came, then where she went i don't know. Sir, if she hadn't come first then she wouldn't have come. Then all this wouldn't have happened. And our animals wouldn't have entered your farm... But sir, what happened was that first she came... ... and then she came. And then... Shut up! What nonsense are you talking? First she came then she came... - No sir. She didn't come first. She had come first. Then i don't know from where, she came. Oh shut up. First she had come, then she came. She had come first. That's what i am sayinf, she hadn't come first. She... - Oh shut up ! Raju, your cattle spoiled my harvest. So i will keep them for three days... ... and sell milk and make up for the loss... ... this is the verdiet of the council. You idiot, i have not married because of you. When will you learn... ... to take care of a cow and a buffalo? Dad, there are 20 cown, 16 buffalos and 18 calf's. Shut up, just shut up! The landlord has taken away our liveli hood for 3 days... ... along with the milk and butter. You must be punished. You will have to sleep for 3 days in the cowshed. Makes no difference, to sleep with you or in the cowshed. What did you say? Nothing. Hey where are you going? Please let me take my cow for sometime. After she meets... ... her calves i will bring her back. The land lords order is for them to stay here for 3 days. The calves are crying for their mother. If i bash you up, you will also start to cry. Now go away! My father never saised his hands on me, and you dog dared to do it. I swear i am going to bash you all up. You will die rascal! Where did he go? Don't let me get away. Come with me. I know i have done wrong, but i also know where to seek justice. Don't you dare try to stop me. Answer me Raju? Why are you silent? Come on, answer to the landlord. Sir, when i sent my cattle to you. I thought they were just cattle. In the night when the calves cried out for their mother, i realized... ... i had not sent just cattle but... ... i had separated them from their mother. God has also given them the strengh to call out to their mother... ... and my heart cried out. I don't have a Mom; ... ... therefore i can feel their pain. That's why i couldn't bear the distance between... ... the mother and children. I felt i had separated them and brought their mother back to them. I have finally found the man. I have been searching for. I will never let him separate from me. I will keep in my heart beats. Look Raju, i can feel that in your emotions lies humanity. You're right. Dad don't get emotional and forgive him. He should be punished. Yes he should be punished, but what should be his punishment? Keep him as a servant in our house for 30 days. Without pay. I agree with you, but you also have to... ... agree that there has been my loss. What ! You mean there has been no loss for me ? Of course it has. Then listen, you will work at my home for 30 days without pay. What! You are not wiling to accept your punishment? No! No! No! I am ready. No! No! No! - Why are you shouting? - What are you doing? Raju! How dare you refuse the verdict of the council? Sir, banish me on an empty island or send me to the gallows... ... but please don't ask me to work at your home or i will surely die. Nothing doing, you will work for 30 days at my home, and that's final. You are shouting again! Dad she has come again. I will hang you from a branch of a tree if i ever hear that again. Mom, i have been seeing you over the years, go to the village. What is there in that village? I will soon tell you everything. Greetings! God bless you. Sister Shalini there is no point in remembering the past. I just can't erase the pain from my heart... ... tell me, has the landlord found... ... a groom for his daughter? You keep asking me the same question each year, and i say no. Why do you keep asking the same question? Because landlord Gajendra's daughter will only wed my son. Have you forgotten his tyranny? If i had forgotten, then i wouldn't be... ... coming here over the last 20 years... ... to enquire about his welfare. He has probably forgotten the crime he had committed. The time has come to remind him of... ... his crime, Priest! The time has come to pay the price of his mistake. He has not kissed me but kissed the fangs of a venomous cobra. I will teach him such a lesson that he... ... will pray to die but will live to suffer. Hi sweetie, your wish is about to come true. What are you doing here, you are his friend? I was, but now i'm your friend. Give some cash and i will give you news. Take this! Wow! 10 grand! Kishen's mother has made him promise that he will never look at... ... a girl or tease her. He will never dare touch another girl. Consider that Kishan has been locked out. Good news. There is more news. No. The news is that his mother has... ... gone to the village and Kishen is alone. This is a golden opportunity for you. Got it sister? Then don't tell me. Understood! Now he will not escape me. " Hey, what do i say? " " Hey, what do i say? " " Listen. " " Tell me. " " Will you come with me to Khandala? " " What will i do in Khandala? " " We will roam about, sing a song, and just have fun. " " Run, run! " Run upstairs! Let's switch off the lights and run. Let the trouble be gone! Let's switch off the lights and here place ok. " I am madly in love with you, sweetheart." " I am madly in love with you, sweetheart." " I can feel my robe slipping off, sweetheart. " " You are very cruel, what kind of a man are you? " " My breath is getting warmer, see this weather is cold. " " See this weather is cold... " " You are very cruel, what kind of a man are you? " " My breath is getting warmer, in this cold weather. " " See this weather is cold... " " My mascara is getting untidy, sweetheart. " " I am madly in love with you, sweetheart. " " I can feel my robe slipping off, sweetheart. " " I am madly in love with you, sweetheart. " I am madly in love with you. Where's the girl?

I don't want to hear anything. Where are you going? - "Dhobi- ghat". "Dhobi-ghat? What has happened to this boy? God, what is happening to me? What disease have you given me? I see her in a buffalo and a buffalo in her. I won't spare her, whether it's her or a buffalo... ... i will scrub her properly. Raju. What kind of a current is this? I can't get up. Raju. Oh God. Hey! What happened to you? Sir, i got a shock. Shock? What shock? A very powerful shock. But how did it happened? I was washing her, then she kicked me, i went and crashed into her... ... and got stuck with a electric pole and... ... i couldn't get up and that has left... ... me shivering. Shevering. Tell me clearly what happened. Sir, due to Meena ma'am i got this electric shock; good you called me... ... or else i would have been a dead man. What did you do with him my child? That he's got such a stock? If he plays with electricity, he is likely to get an electric shock. Now, what happened? Sir, she had come. Again? She come again? - Yes. Oh God! Get this man out of here right away1 No! This man has got me crazy! For the time in my life, i got such a shock. What was that shock? What has never happened has happened now. Aunty! Aunty might know. What kind of electric shock is this? Aunty. Aunty. Listen, listen. Yes. What are you doing? Aunty i am checking your current. Seems you have nothing left... ... your fuse has blown off. CITY GIRLS HOSTEL. The way i stayed back at his house made him look real dumb. He, too, got you packed up. He cheated me on it, or else i would have shown him. I made him a useless fellow. Preeti, like a dog he is looking out everywhere; to bite you. But his mother has... Has his Mom let him loose? He is now free to tease and touch any girl. You are gone dear sister! What! Yes, he is free from his lock- out and will make your life black- out. No. - Yes. I suggest you lock your windows and doors, tonight. This night is going to be very dangerous. I am going or else i might be dragged in the danger. " Hey, what do say? " " Hey, what do i say! " " Listen." " Tell me." " Will you come with me to Khandala? " " What will i do in Khandala? " " We will roam about, sing a song, and just have fun. " Which song did you sing that night... .... i am madly in love with you. Sing it now. Help me Tina! Look inside; it will blow your mind off. Your gang of friends is unconscious. Right now it's just the two of us... .... c'mon give me a hug. Where are you going silly girl? Stupid, girl. Where are you going baby, i will drink up your blood. Don't run away Preeti baby. I will get tired. Wait, Preeti. Why are you running like an athlete? Preeti where are you? Help! Leave me! Where are you hiding? I am restless her. Madam Preeti. I am tired madam Preeti. No. Preeti. Preeti. Oh! Preeti. I was only joking. Leave me. Leave me. - Preeti! Snake! - Snake! Run, there is a snake! What happened? Raju. Go and see there is a snake in the house. There is a snake in the house. Save us. There is a snake in the house. There is a snake in there. Go kill it Raju. I would never kill a snake. Why? That day you bashed up ten goons and today you can't kill a snake. It's different to bash up a goon, but to kill a snake! No i can't! Now go inside. Oh God! Dear Mr. Snake, we are not enemies... ... it's a matter of my prestige, please go. I will close my eyes. Go away, snake. Go away. See it has gone away. Did you see? He got scared of me and fled. Stupid. Help me, please! Well done Raju, you saved my niece, here take this as your reward. Sir, life is precious, if something had happened to her... ... i couldn't have forgiven myself. Raju, do you know why you saved my life, risking yours? Yes. It's just the duty of the servant towards his master. If you had only fulfilled that day... ... then you would have accepted that reward. You did fulfill the duty of master and servant. But it was your duty for love. Raju. Stop it Ma'am. Even the sea knows it limits and breaks at the shore. Please stop your feet from going any further. I may stop my feet but how to stop this heart, which has accepted you. Please try to understand; i am a small and poor person. Your innocence and righte ousness, is priceless for me. A woman wants a husbant who is a good human being, who can love her... ... understand her and support her. I have found you among this crowd, Raju. Love has made you blind, you don't know what is right or wrong... ... remove this from your mind and heart and forget me. I knew this would be your answer. Now listen to my answer; I can't forget you. I can finish myself; do you want to see it? How lovers sacrifice their lives for love? Don't separate me from you Raju; or i will surely die. I will surely die. " I die for your love and my give my heart to you. " " I die for your love and my give my heart to you. " " Please don't forget me darling and don't go far away from me. " Promise; that you will keep your promise. " " Please don't forget me darling. " " I die for your love and my give my heart to you. " " I die for your love and my give my heart to you. " " Please don't forget me darling and don't go far away from me. " " Promise; that you will keep your promise. " " Please don't forget me darling." " I am fortunate to have a lover like you, picturesque like a dream." " You are my dream, my quest, never leave me alone and go away." " I die for your love and my give my heart to you." " Please don't forget me darling and don't go far away from me." Promise; that you will keep your promise." " Please don't forget me darling. Don't forget me. " " I will be your bride and you my groom... ... i pray this wish is granted soon." " I can't bear this separation, come soon my darling, and let's be one." " I die for your love and my heart cries out your name." " Please don't forget me darling and don't go far away from me." " Now that you have made the promise you should fulfill it." " Please don't forget me darling. Don't forget me." Finally you broke your promise. Which promise Mom, you only said that i was free from it! You didn't listen properly. Now listen carefully, you can never marry that girl. But why Mom? Can't i love someone? Yes you can, but not with someone you love... ... but with the one i tell you. You will love her only and wed her only... ... the girl who is born for you only. What are you saying Mom? I can't understand anything. Do you want to know? C'mon i will tell you. This is your father and this is your mother. Mama... Son, i am not your mother, i am your aunt. What are you saying? I will tell you the facts which i have buried in my heart. I will tell you your purpose and... ... your responsibility in life. Responsibility. - Yes. We used to stay in village Chandanpur... ... Landlord Gajendra Singh was a tyrant. He was fond of confiscating the land of the poor farmers. Now you have realized your weakness. C'mon put your finger print on this legal paper. Look, Surjit. Today his arrogance has been broken. Tomorrow your arrogance will be shattered too. Today he has handed his land to me tomorrow you will do the same. I can sacrifice my life. But i won't hand over my ancestor's land to you. Surjit, it has been my old dream to make a factory on this land. I will acquire your piece of land at any cost. Even if you cut my body in thousand pieces... ... i won't give you that piece of land, Thakur. Look Surjit, a day will come when... ... i'll break your pride and your stubbornness. I was in love with Gajendra's younger brother Manjeet. Neither my brother nor the landlord knew of our affair. When Gajendra Singh came to know, he fixed Manjeet's marriage else where. My brother took me to the landlord's house to ask for my right. Sister, look. I brought you here as you insisted it. Now you both stay here, don't come inside. If you do, you will see my dead face. Sister-in-law. Come, Mr. Surjeet. Come. It's my fortune to have you as my guest. Sir, your brother Manjeet and my sister love each other... ... and i have come to seek her rights. So you have come to be my relative. Come sit here, Thakur... Sir, today if you allow him to sit here... ... tomorrow he will sit on your head. Yes, you are right. Get up. Get up. - What? Go and sit there on the floor. That's the place for you. Don't go inside. He has bounded you by his swear. I won't. I will watch from outside. Come, take this drink. No. I don't liquor. Sir, i don't drink. C'mon drink it up. You want to be related to rich people like us... ... so drink it up. Drink it. Drink it. Drink it. Drink it. Drink it. Drink it. Drink it. Now you have acted like my relative. It's not that easy to become rich. Here take this. Sir, i am a vegetarian. Look, he's a vegetarian. No brother... You fool, to become rich one has to... ... drink the blood of the poor, eat this! Not will you eat... After all it's the matter of your sister's life. Eat... Now he is capable to be my relative. Sir, he will only give his sister in marriage, but not his land. What are you talking sir. Why not? He is about to be my relative. He won't give you that land. - Really? What are you saying? Okay, i will remove your apprehensions, dear friends. I will make him sign on the paper to remove all you doubts. C'mon and sign this paper. No, please don't let him do this. What are you thinking; sign this? After all what's yours is mine... ... and what's mine is yours. And what is your is mine instead of being yours. So why are you worried about it? Sign it. No! What are you doing? Please don't sign this paper. We don't want this marriage. We don't want this marriage. This belongs to our forefathers and this land is our mother. Sharda what to do? When children are in trouble... ... it's the mother who cares. Today i am sacrificing my mother for the happiness of my sister. Today you have become my relative. Give me a hug, friend. Go prepare for the marriage. I will bring the marriage party. Go. Yes Thakur... Brother, thank you for accepting Shalini. Here have a sweet. What's this brother? You will marry yomorrow; not Surjeet's sister... ... but the girl i have chosen. I will make Surjeet's wife a window tomorrow. The landlord has come. Surjit babu Thakur sir has come... Thakur sir has come... Greetings everyone. Greeting Thakur sir... Come let's embrace to prove our friendship. Go catch that kid! No No... No... Catch that boy. What are you looking at ? Go. Sister-in-law, brother. Sister-in-law what has happened? Brother... Brother what has happened? How did all this happen, brother? Landlord Gajendra Singh betrayed us. He cheated us. Promise me that my song will marry the landlord's daughter. The kid is hiding inside; burn the place. Swear to me, that you will bring a day when... ... the landlord would be forced to marry his girl with our boys. He will kneel and beg for marriage proposal of our boys. No, brother... Such an atrovity! Such a grave injustice! We will give a befitting reply to them. I will gorget i love someone. Preeti, we cannot meet in this life. My life is not you, but someone. You are not my destination, but someone else is. Please forget me forever, Kishan. Who is the girl for whom Kishan left me forever? Who is the girl whose is my Kishan's life? What happen Reena. You are so upset. The reason is upset. Now we not meet next one week. Why? Because of i am going to Chandanpur. What happened, Raju? Chandanpur. May i have some relationship with this place! Even if you don't have you will now be related to it. Because i am also Chandanpur. Tell me Raju. You will come to Chandanpur, wont you? That's his daughter, who you must wed. Oh! This boy... Get inside quickly. Drive, brother. Move fast. Let's go from here. Greetings! When did you return from Kashi? Just now. Tell me, why all this security arrangement? There was an assassination attempt. I went to Kashi and attacks started. What? I must chek their horoscopes once again. Manjeet, carefully look at this plant. It has been my dream. Now this dream will prove to be costly for you Sir. What nonsense are you talking? Not nonsense Sir, but your stars foretell that Saturn will bring harm. You will be in trouble because of the position of this planets. And even the planet Jupiter's position is dangerous for you. Be careful with this new venture. Both Saturn and Jupiter have entered your house. To be more accurate the causes of your bad luck... ... have entered your horoscope. If you spend some money, i can drive them away, with my prayers. Give me. How much? One million. Half a million. Thirty grand. Twenty grand. Ten grand. Five grand. What? Only 500 bucks? Never mind i will manage. Daddy i am sleepy, good night. Like i was telling you Manjeet, this project is worth 300 million. I have mortgaged everything for this. And with the help of minister Khorana of Delhi... ... i will sanction loan of 200 crore from banks in Delhi. You have mortgaged everything? Don't worry; soon i will be the richest man in Asia. Already you have enough enemies; why do you invite more? No one can harm me. I want you to help me in this project. No brother, i am happy with my agriculture business. Once again congratulations. I will be leaving tomorrow. Good night. You will never understand the power of money. I know what i am doing is wrong, but when you know the truth... ... you will surely accept this marriage. O God, hope Kishen has not taken any wrong step? Preeti? So this is your real self? I thought you were Landlord Gajendra Singh's daughter? I am not daughter of Gajendra Singh. I am Landlord Manjeet Singh's daughter. Gajendra Singh is my uncle and Meena is his daughter. Just shut up. When you had to love Meena why did you cheat me, you liar. I hate you. Preeti, Preeti... Just get lost. Preeti please listen to me. Please stop Preeti. My son let's go from here. The landlord's men will kill you. Mummy listen to me. My swear. I don't want to listen anything. My aunty? What! Preeti is Manjeet Singh's daughter? Yes, Mom, i was about to wed her, when some fool came between us. He is the one. Who are you? I am that helpless child who saw his parents being murdered. I am that helpless child. I saw the breaking Mangalsutra of my Mother neck. I am that helpless child. I am that helpless child who saw those atrocities on my aunt. I am that helpless child. O Raju! I am so happy to see you alive. God has given me two warriors to fight this war. Recognize him Raju? Who is this? My brother's soul will rest in peace. God has united a lost family. Aunty, Gajendra Singh will have to pay with his life... ... for each drop of tear and blood he has shed of ours. No, my son, don't take anyone's life. There won't be bloodshep. You mean we won't take our revenge? We will, but according to the last wishes of your father. Last wishes? According to your fathers last wishes. Promise me sister, you will make Gajendra Singh kneel... ... and beg of you to marry his daughter with my son. Swear upon me. Thakur Gajendra's daughters will be or daughters- in- law. Promise your brother. I swear on you brother. Thakur Gajendra's daughters will be our daughters- in- law. Brother. This will make his soul rest in peace. This will be our revenge. Give me your blessing. We promise that we will marry their daughters. Many years ago i found you, and today you are to part from me. The thought saddens me, but i'm happy that you have found your family. I am just going for a few days, and i will always be in your heart... And it is a matter of few days. After that i will live with you forever. We are indebted to you for looking after our child. Or else God knows how my child would have been. And in what condition?

But our father is a minister. Stop this drama. They're children of your old enemy and have come to avenge them selves. What kind of revenge, sir? Yes, they tore our clothes saying we will avenge our selves. I will disgrace the honour of your family. My hands have been itching to bash up somebody. I could find anyone in prison. But today... What are you doing? - Get aside. No, Sir, don't shoot. It's been a tradition at your place to sacrifice. Two goats before an auspicious occasion. The day we get married, you may sacrifice these two.

What should i do with these cartoons? Lock them up in the cellar and release them on the wedding day. What are you saying? Here write on this. Thakur, Raju and Kishen are inpostors. Their servants are the real groom and sons of minister Khurana. This Raju and Kishan are Surjeets sons. They want to marry your daughters and take revenge from you.

Everyone is asleep at night and you can take me in your arms. See the love letter he has written. Beat him up. From the time you have come, my house is full of happiness... ... don't leave me and go away. How can we leave you father in law? Father in law your shadow may leave you but not us. May i suggest something brother in law. - Yes, sure. You have a big factory. Give me a small partner ship. Arjun Singh, stay in your limits. Why? He has millions; a few thousands wouldn't matter to him. Do you know how much debt he is in? He has mortgaget everything. Yes, and you haven't returned my money. What have you done for me? On your saying i killed four people... ... and spent two and a half years in jail. So you want me to pay you for your term in jail. You should be ashamed of yourself, say sorry to your brother in law. I am sorry. I made a mistake. You are not sorry; you have spoken what was in your heart. Get out! Get out of here. - Get lost. I am sorry Sir. Sorry my foot, does this road belong to your father... ... your idiot. You blind fool. It was not my mistake. Please forgive me. He is like your father, aren't you ashamed to do this? This scoundrel is good for nothing. I will break this mans head. Hey Raju, why are you worried for this beggar? Take this money and get yourself treated. Father, had i not be sworn. I would have cut his hands off. Its okay my son; it was just a few drops of blood. The time has come to settle the score for each drop of blood. I know you both will feel bad. No aunty, he reaps just as he sows. Yes, aunt. As you sow so shall you reap! Tomorrow is the anauguration of the factory. We must blow it up. You two have conspired against my brother; i will shoot both of you. Shalini? You too, will do the same thing what your brother did years ago?

" A thousand lovers die at my smile." " A thousand lovers die at your smile." " There isn't any one like me in Hindustan." " There isn't any one like you in Hindustan." " My bangles jingle and there's music in my anklets." " My drape rustles like the wind and there's music in my ankles." " Sway your hips and strut yourself." " Prop yourself and show your magic." " A thousand lovers die at my smile." " A thousand lovers die at your smile." " There isn't any one like me in Hindustan." " There isn't any one like you in Hindustan."

" A thousand lovers die at your smile." " There isn't any one like me in Hindustan." " There isn't any one like you in Hindustan." Who is my enemy? You? Yes, it's me! Father in law it's him. You spit on the plate in which you eat. Why what happened? Just because he slapped you, instead of making you a partner... ... you blew up his factory. No, i did not. Small indifferences take place in every household. No, i haven't done this. Then what were you doing in there? It was the drink i had and had to use the toilet a couple of times. He's lying! Kishen search him. What happened? Remote. How did this come in my pocket? What do you think he placed it? Yes. - No. You used this to blow it up. Eve the rest has been blown up now. You scoundrel it wasn't even insured. You have destroyed me. Why are you bothering, he will take care of him. No, no. He will beat me badly. Please ask him to stop, he will kill him. Had you not been my relative, i would have shot you. Get lost from here. And don't show me your inauspicious face again. Get lost. Your brother has destroyed me. Creditors will line up and skin my flesh. Now only way is there to compensate for this loss. The only way out, is to get the minister's sons marry my daughters. After that the minister's money will be in my control. Gajendra, don't be under this illusion. This relationship will never happen now. Who are you? I am minister Khuranas wife. Welcome, please come it. Stop right there. Now there is a big difference between us. What kind of difference? The difference between rich and poor. Hello mummy. Come on boys let's go from here. I have nothing more to listen. Please listen to him. He is pleading. Daddy is requesting you, aunt. Please listen to him. Aunt, you will do us a big favor. Okay come here. Wait! Sit on the floor. Sit on the floor in my own house. It is better to sit on the floor than to beg on the street... ... for the rest of the life. Sit down. Sit down. How can i allow my husband to sit on the floor in my house? Tell her to stop there or else i am leaving. You stop right there! Or i'll break your legs. Now tell me. What do you want to say? Everyone in the village has seen your boys with my girls. If this marriage doesn't take place, we will be disgraced. Mom we must help him. He is surrounded by misfortune. Seems he is a big sinner. He must have committed some big sin. He needs some soul cleansing before this marriage takes place. Go and fetch some cow's urine. - I will bring it now. No i won't drink cow's urine. Then this marriage won't take place. Here take this. Drink it up like hot milk. Both are manufactured in the same place. Really. - Yes, from the same company. - You can eat mouth freshener later. Drink it up. Now you are capable to be my relative. But there is... What's next? Son, explain the diet to him. He's a non vegetarian and eats meat and fish. He will eat that. - He will eat that. What item is this? No i won't eat that! I can't have dog's meat. Then this marriage is over. Let's go. Eat it. Think of it as a hot dog. If you don't eat this, proverty will eat you up. Creditors will eat you up like a dog. Before they eat you, eat this hot dog. Okay i'll eat it, be quiet. All this was okay, but what about the dowry? He's a pauper now. He's not a pauper, he still has the factory land... ... and now he's our relative. But how can i? Don't worry we have the legal papers with us. Give him the pen. No, i won't sign this paper. Why, can't you read or write? It's okay, your finger print will do. I won't sign. What is yours is ours and what is ours is yours. Then why are you getting worried about what is yours and what is ours? We will return this land after marriage. Are you speaking the truth? Yes, or else we will see your dead face. Sign it please. No, i won't let you sign this. Shut up! First your brother destroyed me and now you have come. Get out! Mr. Khurana is returning day after tomorrow... ... and will never allow this marriage. It must take place tomorrow. Everything all right? It's okay. Call for the brides. Aren't they looking lovely? Yes they are. I am in awe, in spite of being a pauper... ... how did you manage? I have used my brains. What have you eaten, you smell like a dog. How did he know about this? Stand up for the nuptial rounds. Brother distribute these flowers... ... for the guests to sprinkle on the newly weds. During the nuptial rounds. - Alright. Alright. Take this. Mr. Khurana! Why do you look surprised? I will obviously come for my son's marriage. Aren't you happy to see me here? Of course i am. See your wife is also here. And i have come on the right time... ... or else this auspicious time would have passed. My handsome boys, you are looking great in this attire. My darling sons. My sweet children. The flowers of my garden. You look great in wedding dress. You both are looking so sweet. God save you from evil eyes. What a great couple! Have also brought along you friends. My dear wife, how did you imagine, i would stop this marriage. I have always obeyed you. I accept that i am the minister or the state but... ... you are my home minister. What is this? In my house everything is done with your wish, wife. Why did you do this, tell me? If you don't i will be highly disappointed. I will be ruined and destroyed. Tell me. My dad always speak sweetly when he is worried by the opposition. If he praises a party then that party surely gets ruined. You won't tell me. He needs to be shut up or else this marriage won't take place. I have understood you. Mother of the grooms. My wife. Tell me dear, why are you silent? What's that? Shut him up too. Continue the marriage ceremont. Listen, brother in law. The bride comes to the left and the groom on the right. Wait! I will tell you everything. I have regained my voice. I know the truth. Listen to me. Whatever you wish to say, speak over the microphone. - Thank you. Exchange the garlands. Now the marriage is solemnized. The wedding has been performed... Father in law, open their tapes. Do it. Have some sweets. To hell with your sweets and these two are not my sons. They are your sons. No, no, no. She isn't your wife? She is an unwed wife. And she is acting like their mother without giving them birth. They have taken revenge with you. Do you know who they are? She is Surjeets sister Shalini. These two are his sons; Raju and Kishen. These two are my sons. Yes. - You have ruined everything. But you put tape on your lips. And you have ruined your destiny. I didn't blow up your factory, they did. Both of them did it. Look, know they are congratulating each other? I have fulfilled my brother's last wishes. Today your pride is destroyed. The injustice you did with my aunt today has been resolved. My dead father's soul will now rest in peace. I had told you, true love will always be victorious. Never come between it. Because in the end it become victorious. You have given us much agony. Yet i am willing to forget the past. Children please seek his blessings. Watch out Raju, Kishen. Brother once again they put forward their hands of friendship... ... and you wanted to stab them. Today destiny had something else in store for you.
