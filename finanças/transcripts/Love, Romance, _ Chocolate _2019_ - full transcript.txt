♪ ♪ ♪ Woman [recording]: Welcome to part four of our traveler's guide to Belgium. Do you speak English? Spreekt u Engels? Spreekt u Engels? Do you speak English? Spreekt u Engels? Spreekt u Engels... Spreekt u Engels. Goedemorgen. Good morning, Emma. Woman [recording]: Ik ben een toerist. Ik ben een toerist... Ik ben een toerist. Woman [recording] I am a tourist. Ik ben een toerist. Where is the ATM? Waar is een bancontact? Waar is een bancontact? Waar is een bancontact? Waar is een bancontact? [sighing]Okay... Tina, actually, would you hand me those flowers, please? Sure. Dank u wel. I... sorry. I mean, thank you.[giggling] There we go. All right. Mm... Just... there. Okay, thank you. Is this raspberry frosting? Yeah, with lavender. And a skosh of mint. What's a skosh? It's more than a pinch, but less than a smidge. I was feeling bold. You're a wild one, Emma Colvin. This might be your best creation yet. Aw, thank you! I mean, I know it's a little early for Valentine's cupcakes but I just had to try out the recipe. Are you excited for your trip? Oh, I am so excited. I mean, this time next week, I will be in Bruges. When do you leave? Todd and I leave Thursday. Get there Friday morning. Wow.[phone buzzing] Oh, you know what, this is Todd now. Oh, I was supposed to meet him for lunch 10 minutes ago. I'll be back.Bye. It's looking great! ♪ Excuse me. Hi. I'm so sorry I'm late. It's fine, Emma. Thanks for waiting. You're not gonna believe this. My mother sent this when she heard about our trip. It belonged to my grandmother. She met my grandfather in Bruges! He was studying abroad, she was a diplomat's daughter... But I've already told you all that, right? Yes, you did. Look at this. These are the letters they wrote to each other while they were there! And there's even a picture! This was taken at the Royal Palace! Their first date... First date was was the night of the St. Valentine's gala. Wait, and that's not even the best part. I mean, I know we're not gonna actually be there on Valentine's Day, but our chocolate tasting tour includes a trip to the Royal Ballroom. Right there! Where that picture was taken! Isn't that exciting? It's so exciting! [sighing]Okay. You don't seem excited. I can't go. What do you mean you can't go? We've... we've been planning this for weeks. The timing is really lousy. But I have been offered a promotion. My firm is opening up new offices in Albany. Wait, that... that's three hours away. I'm sorry. I just wanted... I want you to know that these last six months have really been special. I'm sorry, are... are you breaking up with me? Yeah. Wow... ahem. You're not even... you're not even going to ask me if I want to go with you? I already know the answer. Emma... You're not the type of person who... Who... who what? Takes risks. You like things to be comfortable, predictable. I... I'm spontaneous. I'm... I'm totally spontaneous. You planned out every single meal on this trip. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. I made reservations. Yeah, you made reservations. Yeah, because some of these restaurants... I mean, they're... they're very popular. You cannot just walk in off the street for brunch. Todd: So you're saying I've got this whole thing wrong? Okay. Emma, would you want to move with me to Albany? ♪ I don't know... Maybe it wasn't meant to be. I mean... My grandmother moved across an entire ocean to be with my grandfather. I couldn't even move across the state to be with Todd. I was really looking forward to the trip. Who says you can't still go? But... it's a romantic getaway for two. So? So... one. Yeah, but it's all paid for, right? So pack your bags and get on that plane, and just have yourself an honest to goodness unscripted adventure. [sighing]Oh, come on! ♪ Goedemorgen! Oh, hi! Hello, I am Marie. You must be Emma. Yes, hello. Welcome to Chateau Astrid. Can I take your bag? Oh, no, no, I'll take it. Are you sure? Absolutely. It's just this way. Oh, this is... this is just... I mean, wow. I would love to take credit, but I inherited it from my family, so... Yeah, but the decor, it's stunning. I mean, that has to be you. Thank you. Some of it is me! Well... actually, it's all me. Shh. Now for you, I have the Valentine's Day couples' package. It is very romantic. Yeah... it's just me. Actually. Oh, perfect. Okay. Well, you've picked a wonderful time to come to Bruges. We are preparing for a wedding. A wedding? Mm-hm, that's Prince Frederic and his bride to be, Annabelle. Oh, lovely! You can keep that, there is a list of events going on, and some of them are open to the public. Great, thank you! Uh, bedankt! You're welcome. Now let me take you to your room. Someone will bring your luggage for you, okay? It's just this way. ♪ Wow... this is absolutely beautiful. Thank you. There is going to be a small cocktail reception this evening in the lobby. If you'd like to come, you can meet all the other people on the chocolate tour. Is it a fancy thing? I mean, do I need to dress up? No, no, it's just a small cocktail party. You can dress up if you like or just come casual. As you can see, there is always plenty of chocolate. And I serve breakfast every morning on the terrace. Okay. This is for you. Thank you. And I will see you around seven. Okay, great. [sighing] [bell tolling] Wow... all right, Bruges. Show me what you got. ♪ Oh, so pretty! It's beautiful. Sorry, excuse me. Hi, could you just move a couple of inches to the left, please? Um... hi, sorry. I'm a tourist. I was just trying to take a quick picture. I'm, uh... Ik hou van je. Ik hou van je. No? I thought I was further along in that tutorial. Figures. You're the first cute guy I meet in Belgium and you have no idea what I'm saying. Never mind. De ballen. De ballen. Welcome, everyone, and thank you so much for coming this evening. We are in for a very special treat. The chocolatiers of Bruges are vying for the title of Royal Chocolatier. Prince Frederic and Annabelle are hosting a competition to crown the most romantic Belgian chocolate. One that symbolizes their love. So enjoy, get your rest, Tomorrow... Chocolate! [laughing] I just hid a bottle of champagne in a castle for you to find. Oh! Thank you, Liam. Champagne? Emma! I'm so glad that you made it. Cheers! Um, is this a couples' thing? Oh, uh, no. No, no, no. Yes, it is, but everyone is very nice. Trust me. Barbara! And this is her husband Jake. This is Emma. Hi.Hello. Nice to meet you, Emma. Pleasure to meet you. Oh, excuse me, I just... sorry. I have to... It's okay. [laughing] I can't stop saying it... this place is just so beautiful. Oh, thank you. This house has been in my family for generations. I just do what I can to keep their traditions alive. That's why I do the chocolate tour. Which I am so excited about. Me too. You know what? Who needs love when you have chocolate? I agree. Cheers to that. Cheers. ♪ So we're just going to head down this way if you want to follow me, okay? Oh... Mm! It's absolutely magical. Do I have everyone? Perfect. Okay, keep coming. Now, we've all been sampling plenty of chocolate. Would anyone like to make some? Ooh! Yeah! Perfect. This is Chocolatier Simon. It is one of the oldest chocolate shops in Bruges, and my personal favourite. Step right this way. Okay. Come on in, everyone. Please gather around. So in just a moment, we're going to be joined by the owner, Luc Simon, and he's going to walk us through one of his praline recipes. [chattering]And here he is now. Hello, everyone. Welcome to Chocolatier Simon. We're thrilled to have you here today. If you would like to make your way through to the back, there are stations set up for each and every one of you. My assistant Petra here has some aprons for you. The chocolate, when hot, can get a little temperamental. All right, guys, you can follow me in the back. Marie: Thanks, Petra. You speak English? I do. So you understood everything. That's... that's great. Why wouldn't you say anything? Oh, where's the fun in that? Ik ben een toerist. I... hm? What you were trying to say yesterday. I am a tourist. Ik ben een toerist. Oh, wait. W-what did I say? Are you coming? Marie, sorry, what does "ik hou van je" mean? It means "I love you." Oh... Come on. Yeah, that's slightly different. Great. Okay, so next we are going to fill the chocolate moulds with the orange blossom ganache, which is in the piping bags in front of you. We're going to be making the classic orange blossom praline. [chattering] Good, good. Yes. Oh, oh, not too much. Okay... uh-huh. Oh, oh, hang on. That's the, uh, vanilla caramel. Oh, I know. See, we're trying to make the orange blossom praline. Oh, right, but I actually put both. Why? 'Cause I thought it sounded delicious. It does sound good. I think I'd like to try that myself. I highly recommend that you just stick exactly to the recipe. You know, I find some of the best combinations are born out of experimentation. Of course! These... these chocolates and this recipe has been in my family for generations. There's no need for experimentation. Right. Okay. They certainly look like they're having fun. Yes... uh. It's okay. Just breathe. She's not ruining your chocolate. Well... you say that, but. Bye-bye, take care. Thank you. Oh. Hi. So what are these? I made extras. Enjoy. Mm! It's not bad. Marie: I hope you all enjoyed making chocolates this afternoon. If anyone has any questions, let me know. And I hope you enjoy exploring Bruges this afternoon. And if anyone needs anything, you all have my number, so please call. Otherwise I'll see all of you back at the inn later. Enjoy! Bye! Uh, Marie, I thought the tour included the Royal Palace. Oh, I'm so sorry, Emma. Unfortunately because of the preparations for the royal wedding, the palace is closed to the general public, and all of the tours have been canceled. Oh... really? All of them? I'm afraid so. Oh... well, thank you. Of course. See you. ♪ Petra: Luc? Just one second. Sorry... I wanna get this just right. Yes? I just settled the cash drawer. It was a slow day again. I mean, you know, the tour groups are keeping the lights on, but if things stay this way, the shop won't last much longer. Petra, I've told you. I don't want you to worry. I'll handle it. How, Luc? Business will be booming when we are crowned Royal Chocolatier. Luc, half the chocolate shops in the country are competing for that. How could you possibly win? Because we're going to show them something rather special. Come on. Try it. Hmm? Mm-hm. It's good. Good's not good enough. Okay. ♪ ♪ Oh... Wow. Luc: I'll be right with you. Okay. Ah... what is that? Hi. Goedemorgen. I'm sure that means "good morning." It does. Great. Sorry, I'm a bit short-staffed. That was Fin, Petra's husband, just telling me she was going to be a bit late, so... Oh, so Petra's... I-I kind of thought you guys were... Oh, no. She's my assistant. Of course. Right. So, are you interested in more pralines? Honestly, more of everything. Yesterday's were some of the best chocolates I have ever had. Truly. You know, I wondered, what kind are these? With the pink stripes? Ah, that's my grandfather's recipe. Framboise. Thank you. Raspberry.Raspberry. Yeah. Of course. Good? It's incredible. Oh, thank you. Ever thought about adding a little lavender to it? Lavender? Uh, no. No. Don't knock it til you try it. This is incredible. Wow. I guess I'll just take... I'll take an assortment box. A box. Okay. Any particular flavours? You know, I'm gonna leave it... I'll defer to the expert. Hm, okay. Um... You know, I can't think of anything better for Valentine's than a box of chocolates. Huh. Well, your Valentine is a very lucky man. They're for my mom. ♪ Thanks. Sorry, I'm here. Is everything all right? Fine, fine. She's been having contractions. Well, light contractions. Nothing to worry about. But you're not due for another month. The doctor said it was completely normal. I should just, you know, take it easy for a while. Yeah, sounds to me like you should be at home. I tried to tell her. Petra: Luc, it's almost Valentine's Day. You can't work on the Royal Chocolatier submission and run the shop at the same time. Luc: I'll get Chloe to do the register. She's part time, Luc! Luc: I'll think of something. I could take some of her shifts. Sweetheart, the bakery keeps you busy as it is. I could help. I mean, if you need an extra set of hands. I could help. You? Yeah, I'm a food stylist. I work with desserts every single day. I think she could do it. Fin, you don't even know her name. Emma. It's Emma. Her technique on the praline wasn't half bad. Thank you. Oh, please. She mixed a vanilla caramel and an orange ganache. To rave reviews, I might add. I mean, I know my way around a flavour profile. Petra: Luc, you need the help. Either she stays, or I do. Look, let's be honest, Emma. You're here on vacation. Do you really want to spend it here? The participants are invited to the events hosted at the Royal Palace, right? Yes, that's right. Okay, so I help you here... If... you'll take me to the palace. ♪ When can you start? Great. Oh! Well! If it isn't Belgium's newest chocolatier! Emma: Oh, you heard about that. Marie: Well, Luc and I are very good friends. Emma: Has he always been so uncompromising? That's a very polite way of putting it, but, uh, yes. [chuckling]Good to know. You know, I wanted to ask if I could extend my stay, by a week. I know it's short notice. Oh, of course. Emma: So how does the actual competition work? Luc: Oh, Prince Frederic and Annabelle will visit each shop in the city, and then the chocolatiers will bring their entry to the palace, and the winner will be announced the next night, at the St. Valentine's Ball. And what do you get for winning? Prestige. Well, it's an honour to be named the Royal Chocolatier. And you get a plaque. Okay, now we're talking. So that gives us just over a week to come up with a new chocolate that embodies all the qualities of Valentine's Day, and of true love itself. Ah, so it's not just a chocolate, it's a metaphor. I suppose. So what do you have so far? Not much. I've been keeping a notebook of ideas, but... Hm, it's empty. I've been tearing the pages out with the bad ones. Okay... Right, okay, well let's start at the beginning, shall we? This is our base chocolate. And what is that? These are the pellets that they get after they roast and grind the beans and add some ingredients. So you don't grind the cocoa beans yourself? No. There are strict standards for what qualifies as a Belgian chocolate, so most chocolatiers take their base from a central source. However, everyone's is different. Ours is a special blend created by my grandfather and then tweaked by my father over the years. ♪ Mm... Still not right. Okay, we're in Bruges. It's almost Valentine's Day. There's love all around us. We should head outside and find some inspiration. We need to be in here to make chocolate. It's either out there with the happy couples or in here, with your empty notebook. What will it be? Let's start in the park. Chloe? Yes? Can you watch the register? Okay. ♪ Emma: Well, I think we have a really good assortment of chocolates. Luc: Absolutely, this is great. [laughing] Ah... I do kind of feel like a kid in a candy store. Where should we try them? Well, it's such a beautiful day. How about a picnic? Okay. Over there? Yeah. ♪ Every shop has their own way of doing things to make them unique. Therefore, no two chocolates taste the same. Now let it melt in your mouth. Let it sit on your tongue, just for a moment. Taste the texture? Mm-hm, it's... it's actually softer than dark chocolate usually is. That's right, that's because it's dark milk chocolate, which uses more cocoa butter. Now the trick is to savour it, let the flavour come through. So what do you taste? Mm... vanilla. Yes, and? And it's... you know, it's almost fruity, maybe. Like... Blueberries, or... no. No, no, no... blackberry. Very good! Really? Yes. See, each chocolatier uses essences of different flavours to create their signature taste. Mm, it's amazing. Luc: You okay? Yeah, I'm just feeling a little envious. They make it look so easy. Never mind. I'm sorry. I'm nursing a bit of a broken heart. Oh, I'm sorry. Oh, it's okay. It led me here, to this new adventure. I don't normally take risks like this. Really? Yeah, I like to play things safe, I always have. I just kind of thought it was time for a change. You know? Time to take a bigger leap and see where I land. And, well, I landed here in Bruges. So that's why you came to the city? To find love? Oh, no, no. I came to find chocolate. Well. But if love finds me... who am I to say no? I should probably start saying no to chocolate, though. That's a good one. [laughing] Okay, so I guess the big question is, what would get Frederic and Annabelle's attention? What says love and romance to them? How about a fruit infusion? Well, sure, I mean, fruit can totally be romantic. Strawberries, raspberries... sure. But I mean, watermelon, not so much. But what about something more unexpected? Such as? I don't know, but think about it. A passionate love can be hot and spicy. You know, things like wasabi or curry, or chili. They put stuff like that in chocolate, right? I don't. Besides, you ever tried to kiss someone after eating wasabi? Okay, fine. Fair enough. Why do you need to put anything extra in it? I mean, the beauty of chocolate is its simplicity. But sometimes an unexpected combination can lead to something even better. I once styled a magazine cover on unique combos. Unfortunately, this isn't one of your magazine covers. So you and Luc couldn't come up with anything for the competition? No, I feel like he kinda came up with a reason to not like every single thing I suggested. Hm... well did he have any ideas? He did, but they were all just, kind of, you know, things he already does. I threw a few things out there that were a little, you know, unexpected, outside of the box, and he kinda shot them down. Well, I mean, maybe if you can't convince him that your combinations would work, you could show him? Marie, could I borrow your kitchen? Yes, you can. ♪ What's all this? Well, Emma thought it would be a good idea if you tried some of her cupcakes. You didn't have to do all this. Well, you're trying to make the most romantic chocolate ever. I figured it required a... A mood. Okay. Here we go. Sit. Okay. Okay... No... no, my grandmother always said it was very bad luck to choose your own Valentine. You have to choose one for each other. Thank you. Perfect. Enjoy. [giggling] All right, here we go. This is incredible. Thank you. See, I told you I knew what I was doing in the kitchen. I can't quite identify exactly what the flavour is. Mm, that's because it's a secret. Oh, a secret? A top, top secret ingredient I will never divulge. I can taste cherries. Okay, so it's not so top secret. It's cherry cola. I know, I know. Go ahead. Lay it on me. What? You're about to say you can't mix cherry cola with a chocolate cupcake. No, I like the taste of cherries. And you know what? The cola gives it an unexpected zing. Oh! Mm... Oh. So let me guess. This is your nice way of telling me that I need to be a little more adventurous when it comes to the competition? I just think we need to consider all ideas. You know? And see where inspiration takes us. Okay. Okay? You've convinced me. Really? Yes. Okay. Now can I have another cupcake? Yes, you may have them all. Thank you. ♪ [sighing] ♪ Sorry, we're closed. Max: Slow night. Can I help you with something, Max? Well, I was hoping you had reconsidered my offer. My shop's not for sale. You're very stubborn. Has anyone ever told you that? Once or twice. Is it you won't sell, or you won't sell it to me? It's my shop, and I'm not selling to anyone. I respect what you're tying to do here, Luc. Carry on a family legacy. Nice. But come on, this shop is a relic from the past. So why don't you come and work for me? [laughing] I don't think so. Luc, nothing can save this shop. It's a lost cause. Yeah? Really? Well, there will be a line around the corner when I'm the Royal Chocolatier. [chuckling] You cannot be serious. Oh, I am. Very serious. So you think you've come up with a winner? Best thing I've ever made. Well, we'll see then. I guess we will. Goodnight, Max. I think I have an idea of how we can find true love. So my grandparents met in Bruges. They fell in love right here in this city. Maybe their story is the inspiration we need. Look. This is it. "My love, the sound of the water "gently lapping beneath us. "The scent of lavender carried on the soft breeze. "The feeling of your lips as we shared our first kiss. "Light as a feather, but filled with the weight of promise for a future yet to come. Kisses, H." My grandfather always said, in that moment, that's when he knew he'd spend the rest of his life with her. Just like that? You sound surprised. You don't think you can fall in love in an instant? I guess I'm just a little bit more reserved when it comes to matters of the heart. I prefer to take things slowly. Deliberately. Hmm. Kinda like following a recipe. [chuckling]Yes, something like that. I suppose you like things a little bit more unscripted? I do like to think that... for the right person, I'd be brave enough to take that leap. So, we have to manually temper the chocolate, because there are four fatty acids in the cocoa, and they all melt at different temperatures, so... this process helps them to cooperate. Is there a tool for people like this in your life? I wish. You wanna take the scraper and the pallete and have a go? Sure. Yeah.Right. That's it. That's it! One, two, one, two. There's no need for choreography. What do you mean, I'm such a good dancer. Yes, yes, I can see that, but... Here, this arm has to keep in, this keeps still. And it's all like... This one. It's important to get... the same motion at the same time. Good, that's right. Keep at it. That's it. Keep going. And go back the other way. That's it, that's it. Trick of the trade. Here. On your lip. Feel the temperature change. Consistency. Mm. Mm-hm. Good. Carry on. Emma: So how old were you when your father taught you to do all of this? Oh, pretty much as soon as I could reach the table top. Really? And that's what you just always wanted to do? Yes, it was pretty much settled from a very early age that I would be in here. My father used to joke that we have chocolate in our veins. It's so nice to do what you love. You don't love what you do? I like it. I mean, it was a sensible career path. I was offered the job right out of college, and... It's good, it's given me a lot of... stability. Hm. We spend so much time on our careers, we should at least do something that moves us. What did you dream of? What did I dream of? Yeah, when you were growing up. I wanted to own a cupcake shop. You should! You're very talented. Oh, thank you, but it's just a hobby. It's not a career. But you love it. I do. I do, but starting a business, and pouring all of my time and money into something that might fail is just... it's a risk. Well, maybe your time in Bruges is the beginning of many new adventures. ♪ It's amazing. I was a little distracted, but... You ready? Here we go! Mm, no. It's not bad. But it's not sublime. It's just chocolate. Oh... You know what I mean. No... I won't accept anything short of perfection. Okay. Then we try again. Again. ♪ Hello! I was hoping to get some restaurant recommendations. Of course. Modern? Traditional? Romantic? Uh... it's just me, so maybe something with takeout. Emma, you are here on an adventure, in the city of love. Yeah, I'm pretty sure that's Paris. Says who? Either way, you shouldn't be eating alone. I think Luc is closing up soon. Perhaps he could meet you somewhere? No, we were together all day. I'm sure he's happy to have the break. Hm... but he is handsome. Uh... yeah... Yes. Yes, he's... yes, he's handsome. But I'm not interested in dating anyone right now. Not even a little? Besides, I'm holding out for a prince. Oh, me too. Unfortunately, we only have the one. Well, there are other countries. I might have to move. Might take the place with me. Maybe I'll go to Paris. "So lovely." Anyways, um, food. What are you thinking? Do you need some help? You look a little lost. Oh, no, I'm not lost. I know exactly where I am. I'm right here. Well, in that case, I hope you can swim, 'cause you're in the middle of the canal. That's... oh, I thought that was a road. [laughing] Where are you trying to go? Um, I really don't have any place in mind. I'm just kind of searching for adventure. Well, if I can't help you, with your destination, maybe I can give you a hand with your starting point. Okay. So you are exactly here. Oh, okay. I'm there. I was really far off. All right, well, thank you so much for the help. My pleasure. ♪ Letters from home? These belonged to my grandmother. My grandfather wrote her a letter every day they were apart. Wow. And I can't even get a guy to text me back. [laughing] What about Liam? Oh, no, he's not... We're not. No, he just, um... He supplies the champagne for me and for the palace. His family owns the domain. Oh, yeah. He seemed pretty excited to see you the other night. No, he's, um... He's just friendly. Enjoy. ♪ Did you find what you were looking for? [laughing]Hi. Hi, Max. Emma. Hello. Well. Well... yeah, it seems like I'm getting closer. Have you been waiting long? About 20 minutes. This place sure is popular. Come on. What? Oh, no, no, no, we can't cut in line. I'm pretty sure that's poor etiquette in any country. Just follow me. What? Wait... what are you... Okay. Sorry. So sorry. What's happening? It's gonna take us forever to even be noticed. I wouldn't be too sure of that. You know the owner. Uh, no, I actually don't. Yeah. Oh... you... you? Guilty as charged? Wait... is this a cactus with chocolate? The attention to detail is incredible. You know, we showcased a chocolate shop in our magazine last month that used a similar technique. Ah, so you work for a magazine? Well, I'm a food stylist. So you definitely know your chocolate. Here. You should try this one. All right. Mm... mm! You know, it's sweeter than most chocolate. Sweet potato, believe it or not. Really? Yeah. Well, I've always thought that the best combinations were born out of experimentation. Me too. Yeah... Me too. Let me show you one more thing. ♪ What do you think? I mean, this is incredible. Wow. Come, I'll give you a tour. ♪ So are you just visiting Bruges? I was, but now I'm actually working. Do you know Chocolatier Simon? Yeah, uh, it's funny, 'cause I know Luc quite well. Actually we grew up together. Oh, wow, and now you're both chocolatiers. Uh, well, yeah, we were always quite competitive. When we were young, I was made captain of the football team, or as you Americans say, "soccer." So Luc wasn't pleased at all about it, and, um, he started to show up early at the practice, before I got there. I started to put my alarm earlier. And then the next day, he was waiting when I arrived. Really? Yeah. So, it went on like that for weeks, and soon, we were both hours early, waiting all by ourselves. That's so funny. Now, you're both vying for royal chocolatier. Yeah. I'm not worried. Oh, really? Well, you should be, because we have something... I don't know. It's pretty special. Is that so? Yeah. It's so. Well, if you're helping Luc with the competition, you'll be staying awhile? Um, I'm actually heading back to New York just after Valentine's Day. Great. Perhaps we can do this again. Sure. Thank you. Have a good day. You as well. [banging] Th... this is a disaster. What did I do wrong? It's because you didn't temper the chocolate properly. That's why you're not getting a clean separation from the mould. Alright. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. But this is my fifth try. I'm normally very good in the kitchen. Well, this is a little harder then baking cupcakes. Um, cupcakes aren't easy. When was the last time you baked? A long time ago.Uh-huh. And I bet you would have just as much trouble as I am doing this. Oh, I very much doubt it. Really? Okay. Challenge accepted. Oh. Mm-hmm. Uh, vanilla extract. Sorry. That looks, um... It's... it's getting there. It's getting there. I think it should be stirred a little. Yeah, okay, okay. Just a touch. Um, how much salt exactly do I need to put in? Just a smidge. What's a smidge? It's a a very small amount. How small? It's slightly more than a skosh but less than a tad. Okay, now, you're just having a little fun at my expense to prove your point. [laughing] Um, no. I'm pretty sure this proves my point. [laughing sarcastically] [laughing] How did you learn to bake like this? Oh, I owe it all to my mother. Did she know what a smidge is? [laughing] No. My mother is a recipe follower. Yes. Everything is carefully measured, and everything is planned, down to the smallest detail. There was no room for experimenting in my mother's kitchen. So all this is... Baking sort of just became my way of... letting loose. [chuckling] Funny. I always wanted to do exactly as my father did. Oh, well, I've tasted your chocolates. You were smart to do so. I still don't know what a smidge is, though. Come here. [whispering] Come here. [aloud] That is a smidge. ♪ [Emma laughing] Okay.

It's... good. You're just saying that to spare my feelings. Yes. Mm-hmm. [laughing] I'm sorry. But you know what? I do think we found some really good flavour combinations.

Almost as nice as baking cupcakes with you. [laughing] [chuckling] [inhaling deeply, exhaling] Cheers. Cheers. You know, being out here with all this and you reminds me one of your grandfather's letters. It was incredibly inspiring. He wrote, "To my dearest Alinda, "my travels always leave me missing you "in the most surprising places "and at the most surprising times. "Today, it was at dinner, "where all I could think about "was how I would have preferred "to have been sitting across from you "as we dined. All my love, Harry." I can't believe you memorized that.

[laughing] That's a bit of an exaggeration. Max: When you get the chance, stop by Van Dender again. I got something new I'd like to show you. Okay. Again? Hmm? You visited Van Dender? Yeah.

[chuckling] Well, we're very happy you did. Thank you. [laughing] Um, I... I just have to tell you, that is a beautiful necklace. Oh. [both laughing] Thank you. Are... are those lilies? Um, cherry blossoms. It was a gift from Frederic on our second date. Aw. The first day we met, she wore a sweet perfume. It smelled like cherries. And when I saw that necklace in the window shop, my mind drifted to her. Aw. Do you mind if I ask how you met? Interestingly, it's related to why we are holding this event. Yes. We... we actually met because of chocolate. Really? Oh. So, you see, I was in this charming chocolaterie in Brussels. I was in town for a conference. Yes. And the short version is that Frederic and I reached for the same truffle at the same time. [laughing] Wow. So chocolate literally brought the two of you together. You could say that. Yeah. Do you mind if I ask exactly what kind of chocolate that was? And more importantly, who got it? [laughing] Um, it was dark chocolate, and we shared it. Aw. And it's been a fairy tale ever since.

Also, you've helped me so much, and you're only in the city for a limited amount of time. I would hate for you to look back and regret it. Why would I regret it? [chuckling] Well, surely, there are other places you'd rather be, other people you'd rather be with? Luc, I'm here because I want to be here. Okay? Okay. Good. Alright, let's get to work. ♪ Good evening, sir. Good evening. Which is this one? Uh, cinnamon/pear, sir. It's no good. You didn't even taste it. I can tell by looking at it.

Are you telling me it's my fault? No, sir. You know, I have less than a week to get this right. So, what do you suggest I do? ♪ Emma: Are those your parents? Yes. They worked here together for 35 years. They passed a few years ago. I'm sorry. You know, my father proposed to my mother in the shop. Really? He hid the engagement ring in the display case. Wow.

Just work? [laughing] I mean, it kind of has to be, doesn't it? We don't even live on the same continent. That is a challenge, yes. But love is worth it, no? Wait. Love? I'm not in love. Oh.
