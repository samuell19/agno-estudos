You scared me. Hi, Priyanka. Hi, Ajay. You got scared by me? You appeared on my phone like a poltergeist of some viral. Great! I've scared you. Whereas all the way here I was thinking of how I would impress you. I think you have succeeded partially I guess else I wouldn't be sitting here. Ma'am, what can I get you? I'll have a red wine. Sangria. Okay, ma'am. Sir. Make that two. Sure, sir. Hey, congratulations! - For your victory on such a big case. - Thank you. Thank you. You only fight women's cases. You don't fight for men. You feel men are so wrong. Those men who are wrong I find them wrong. So, according to you all the men in the world are wrong. No. Not all men are wrong. Just as you don't appear to be wrong. That is true. - Thank you. - Thank you. You know, while chatting with you on the dating app for the past few weeks I wondered why everyone think like you. Incidentally, where do you stay? I mean, which part of the city? I'll tell you. I shall show you my house when I drop you off home. How come you were so sure I wouldn't refuse you? Because nobody has said no to me before today. Really? How many girls have you dropped home prior to this? - Before you? - Yes. Um.. sixteen. - What? - Yeah. Sixteen. Come on. How is that possible? Don't you have anything better to do? Is this what you do all the time? This is my occupation. I drop girls. By the way, my house is close by. Are you in a hurry to go home? Aren't you enjoying my company? I am. Obviously but one has to go home. It's pretty late. Don't tell me you haven't said bye to your family for the last time. I cannot guarantee that. I can't take you back home so you may bid them goodbye. What? You're kidding. I am not kidding. I don't do jokes. I hate jokes. People who laugh at jokes are very sadistic people. They derive pleasure from seeing others in pain. It's pathetic! I can tell you one thing though. Nobody will laugh when you die. Promise. Look, I'm not liking it. Stop the car. I want to get off. Just stop the car. Here? Yes-Yes. Stop-Stop the car. I just need to get down. Look, you will regret it if I stop the car here. Stop the car! Stop the car! Please stop the car! Stop the car! Stop the car! Will you please stop the car! I told you. Yes, mom. Yes, I am a little late. I will be there in a half hour. No, no. Go ahead and eat your dinner. Leave my dinner out. I will eat when I get home. Okay. My name is Priyanka. I am a lawyer. I my client get a divorce. I sent her husband to jail because he used to torture her mentally and physically. ?? ?? And he is going to kill me because ?? Please. What is going on here? Are you going to take some kind of action or are we going to sit here watching a video like this every week? - We are doing our working on it, sir. - 'Working.' This person, whoever it is, is very clever, sir. He posts videos from the victim's phone. The crime scene has either malfunctioning CCTV cameras or it turns out the footage is corrupt when we retrieve it. Moreover, if we find footage of his car from the traffic signal cameras it is not of much use to us. We never find the car. This man has committed several such murders in various states of India before Kolkata. Even the local State Police have no information on him. This is very strange! This man doesn't molest or rape anyone. He brutally kills these women, then he takes a video of them using their phones and makes them viral. What is he trying to tell? What happened? You fell off the bed again? I think I was dreaming and.. The same James Bond dream? Tell me. How come you have these lofty dreams, Durga? Don't you ever have any normal housewife dreams? Wherein your husband is promoted or your son stands first in class. I am buying a new car. I wish you would have such dreams at times. But you are busy emulating James Bond. You are not an undercover agent, Durga. You are a simple housewife. Please go back to sleep and let me sleep too. "My breath is connected with you." "You are a part of my dreams." "You are the light in my heart." "My breath is connected with you." "You are a part of my dreams." "You are the light in my heart." "Life becomes bright at the break of dawn." "I am swaying." "New avenues opening up." "Spreading joy everywhere." ?? "I hope my story is not left unsaid." ?? Durga! Durga! Oh! Oh! Let go, I say! What are you doing? Look, Durga. This old man walked into our house and he is trying to molest me. Scoundrel! Look. She forgot again. I am not a scoundrel! I am your husband. Husband. "My breath is connected with you." "You are a part of my dreams." "You are the light in my heart." - Durga. - Yes. "You are a part of my dreams." "You are the light in my heart." "My breath is connected with you." "You are a part of my dreams." "You are the light in my heart." - ?? ?? - ?? - "My breath is connected with you." - ?? - "You are a part of my dreams." "You are the light in my heart." I am leaving, Durga. - Wait. Wait. Wait. Wait. - ???Bengali Mama. Mama. I want to go to the carnival. All my friends are going. Ridaan. - You want to go to the carnival? - Hmm. Where do you think you are? This is a carnival. What other carnival do you want to go to? You have to go to school, not the carnival. Why do you always.. ?? "Dreaming day and night." "I dream with open eyes." "All my wishes have been fulfilled." "My follows." "My heart leads." ?? ?? ?? ?? "My breath is connected with you." "You are a part of my dreams." "You are the light in my heart." So frustrating! You know that? That's why I made these videos and sent them to you. You could not catch a common man. You call yourself Special forces? I am making a special appearance in this video. Okay? Come and get me. But how will you nab me? Your last agent is lying dead here. Wait a minute. ?? Raghav was our last agent, sir. And he was one of our best. This common man only made videos of girls till date but this is a first. He made a video of himself killing our last field agent. He's mocking us. He is making fun of us. Also, sir, this man only targets strong and independent women. That is the ideology of his organization. According to them we have tsunamis and earthquakes because women were jeans and drive cars. Also, the world order is changing because woman work. People of that school of thought have built an organization called the common man organization. Can you believe it? And their mission is to eliminate every strong woman on earth. And this man is the Indian representative of this organization. This common man is certainly not common by any measure but like any common man he blends into a crowd, does his job and disappears in the same crowd. For the past few months he has made Kolkata his home. If we fail to nab him then the Chief will close down the Special Force. How is this even possible? Not one field agent is available in the entire agency. If that wasn't enough you confidently lied to Chief Gill. Now where will we find this special agent who will go undercover to nab the common man. Sir, this is one of our handlers. Ravinder Sharma. Originally he was based in Mumbai but he was posted in Kolkata in 2005. What's so strange about that? His agent hasn't been mentioned anywhere in his records, sir. What? How is that possible? Contact him. Not possible, sir. He died two years after his posting in Kolkata. - How? - Natural death. Dhawal, I want you to go to the record room - and find this handler's posting file. - Yes, sir. Kajal, I want you to check the system. How many of our agents were sent on the field in 2005? - Come on. - Yes, sir. Eighteen agents, sir. And all these agents are dead. In fact even those who were posted before and after them - they're also no more. - Strange. How? Some died by natural death, some during their mission and the rest were killed by the common man. And if we count Ravinder Sharma, then 19 agents were posted that year. That means there is one agent on whom there is no record. I don't understand how that is possible but I think there is 100 percent chance of him being alive. I want you to do something. I want you to go on the network that runs solely on the Special force used exclusively for the cell phones we've given to our agents to send signals to them and send a signal. Verify every phone with the agent. - Come on! - Yes, sir. Whose phone is this? Sir, this phone is in the house of someone called Devdas. And that's in Kolkata. ???Bengali ???Bengali ???Bengali ???Bengali ???Bengali ???Bengali ???Bengali ???Bengali Brother Varun. ???Bengali What do you mean? I mean to say what kind of material are you looking for? I am looking for a special kind of material. I mean a material which requires a lot of force to make. Special force material. Special force material? Excuse me. - Yes. What is it? - Hello, sir. - Jeet? - Hello? Hello? Actually I am looking for is a special type of material. Special type of material that contains various codes. - Codes? - Yes. I want code 091 material. 0-9-1. Give me the file or I will shoot you! Give it another thought, Jeet. The time to think has passed. Pass it to me quickly. Give me. Sorry, buddy. Are you okay? I have never heard of any such material. Excuse me. What is it? Talk! Sir, we have found both, the agent and the double agent. What? We had to kill Jeet. However, sir, Dev is not our agent. Agent 091 is his wife. - Durga. - Durga? Durga? Hail, Goddess Durga! Hail, Goddess Durga! That reminds me. I am in the wrong shop. Actually the special force material is available in Durga cloth store. Durga cloth store. Sorry to have bothered you. Don't mind me. Don't mind. ???Bengali ???Bengali Sir, how can a lady who can't handle herself handle a mission? It's a suicide mission, sir. We would be compromising both, the agent and the mission. Not at all. Even field agents are human beings. Super heroes exist only in films. Do you comprehend? Also, the reason only this agent has survived out of all our agents is because her cover is simple. She's a housewife. Who will suspect her? Besides, we will only assign her to tracking and reporting. That's all. Everything said and done, she will be our James Bond. Rangeela! Rangeela! Rangeela! Why are you making those lurid signs, you big fat priest! I had to make those signs to ask you to come close. The nerve of you. You are standing in a temple and making dirty signs. You aren't afraid of God. Shall I call the Police? You think you can make a complaint against a Special force agent to the Police? Silly! Agent 091. Special force? I have come here to assign you to the mission which you've been eagerly awaiting for years. Hari Om. Hey! What? I am not going to take on any mission. My son's unit tests are coming up in seven days. Hey, Durga. ???Bengali ???Bengali ???Bengali Unit test? Durga! This happens because you don't take your medicines on time. Then I am called for in the middle of the night on an emergency. Please give her the medicines on time, Ajay. I won't be available for a few days tomorrow onwards. If she falls in this manner.. Are you going on a holiday, my dear? No, aunty. I am going to a village nearby to teach the underprivileged girls over there. The intelligent girls who wish to study further.. ?? God! Ajay. You scared me. Why does everyone get scared when they see me? I am a common man. What can I do? I felt I should escort you to your car. I need to talk to you. Yes. What is it? I have a condition. Any time I come across a lady who I hear talking about woman empowerment, educating girls, helping them progress, finding them jobs and enabling them to get a scholarship I hear music playing in my head. It increases my heartrate. It causes arteries to go tense. It increases my cortisol levels. Testosterone decreases. The left hemisphere in my brain is stimulated. Meaning? Meaning that I become angry. It hurts me a lot internally. I need to kill that woman who says those things to relieve myself of this stress. You know what I am saying? Give me your phone. I want to make a video. I'm sure you've seen it on the news. I make videos of the women who I.. You haven't seen it? You've seen them, haven't you? Give me your phone. Give me. Give. Mr. Ganguly's house has been vacant for a long time. I used to tell him to rent it out. It would be nice to see someone in the window across. Well, what do you do? I am a Professor at Kolkata girl's college. - I see. - That's why I found a house close to it. I shall bring my family here when I'm done setting up the house. Are your things still in the tempo? Yes, actually I.. Oh! Joy! Oh God! - What happened? - What were you doing? I've told you a number of times not to get up to mischief. It was such fun, mama! ???Bengali ???Bengali My child would have died of shock and you would be busy talking! Where was your mind, Durga? This is Ayesha. She has come to live in Mr. Ganguly's house. - Hello. - Hi. ?? Are you okay, Joy? Excuse me. Joy. Son. Joy! Can't you take care of him, Durga? Useless! Your kid.. is he alright? Yes, he is just fine now. Thank you so much for your concern. By the way, I'm Ayesha. Oh! Hello. It's Dev. I mean to say, my name is Dev. - Hi. - Hi. Would it be possible for you to help me? My things.. Yes, yes. Of course. My pleasure. For sure. Let's go. Where is it? Let's go. I'll do it. - So sweet of you! - Thank you. Let's go. - Shall we? - Let's go. Bye, mama! Bye. It's no use no matter how many times you tell them. Did Tulika give you the news? - What? - Yesterday she told me the Math teacher hasn't been coming for the past 4-5 days. - What? - Yes. - Why? - I don't know why. - Look at the things that are going on here. - O God! I have to go. I have some shopping to do. We will discuss it at leisure tomorrow. Okay? Sure. - See you. - Bye. Rickshaw! Will you take me to the vegetable market? Rangeela. Hey. Hello. Hello. If the unit tests are over, can we discuss business? What do you want to discuss? I am a housewife. I don't work. We need you desperately. - The common man organization is.. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know. I watched it on the news but I cannot do anything about it. Hey! How can you say that? You are an agent. You have to go undercover to investigate it. What do you mean, go undercover? What do you think I've been doing all these years? How much deeper must I go? Hey. Hey. Hold on. Listen to me. Did you agency contact me once during the past 10 years? They trained me and then got me married. Then they said this is your cover. I suspected my husband and mother-in-law all these years wondering why the agency got me married to him. I postponed conception for four years. Do you have any how difficult that is? I got tired of sending mails on the email ID you people gave me after my handler passed away. Its status was the same as me. Waiting. Hey, buddy. - What? - Sorry. Durga. Let me explain. Look, some hard drives and the data they contained were destroyed in a fire that took place in the Special forces office the very same year that you were posted. Besides, your name was deleted from the records. The staff changed and a data entry of your name wasn't made from the papers to the computer. I only learned this two days ago. Hold it. What do you mean, the data entry wasn't made? Are you making fun of me? You turned someone's life completely upside down and forgot about it? Don't you show me your face again! Rangeela. Hello. Hi, sir. This is Akshay. Do you require a home loan? What is the update? Any progress? The common man has instructed us not to do this alone. Listen. Pick up a parcel from Victoria Memorial 2 days from now. And notify our Special force informer about this drop. Message me. No phone calls. Okay? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Sure, sir. Ticket. Ticket. You're back? Didn't I tell you not to show me your face again? I've come here to show you something else, not my face. Look. Look, Durga. This common man killed all our agents. You are our last hope. I am not your hope, I am hopeless. I will get out on the first ball. You won't be able to win any match if you rely on me. ?? You are capable of completing this mission. You can catch that common man. Give me a ticket. The ride is free, bro. Go. Go. Have you lost your mind?! Do you honestly believe a housewife can nab that common man just by looking at a black birthmark? Yes! Oh! My stop! My butter. ?? Stop! Stop! Stop! Rangeela. Roy. Look at this. There's a message from Jeet. they will be picking up a parcel from Victoria Memorial at 8:30 tomorrow night. I shall trace this number. You call Jeet. Get up Yes. The one sitting in front of the TV is your husband. He can't hear, mom. He.. Mom.. If you put the hearing aid in his ear.. Mom.. Yes.. Mom.. I'll call you back in five minutes. Take that off. Why are you doing this to me? Please try to understand that I am no longer that girl who was trained by the Special force 12 years ago. Do you understand? Sir, I was 18 years old back then. I had left the orphanage and I wanted to do something with my life. A senior agent entered my life back then. I thought I was getting a chance to serve my country. It was his suggestion I marry so it could have a cover. I did not want to marry him. I had to. Well, I did not get what I wanted but then, sir, I got something I never had. A family. And now that I have convinced myself that my family is my life you have brought me a mission?! I don't want to do this anymore. I am a middle class housewife, just as the Special force wanted and now I have to seek my husband's permission to do anything. Permission. ?? ?? We come out for dinner after such a long time. It won't hurt you to put down the phone for a bit. Hmm. Rangeela. Okay, I've put it down. Talk. No, no. Go ahead and chat. It must be very important. You just said that.. Good evening, sir. - Good evening. - I'm Rangeela. I am going to be your waiter today. Sir, are you ready to order? No, we haven't decided as yet, so.. Rangeela. Hold on. I have seen you before. You took the words right out of my mouth. I too have seen you somewhere. Do you work in Bada bazaar? Yes. Exactly. I have a warehouse over there. - I'm a businessman. - Right! No wonder! And what does ma'am do? She doesn't do anything. She's just a housewife. Just a housewife. A housewife can never be just anything, sir. A housewife is always special, sir. She looks after her husband, child and her in-laws all at the same time. She does all the household chores. She endures everybody's tantrums. And when nobody appreciates all of that she placates herself with a smile and falls asleep so that she may do all those chores the next morning that will please her family. If the housewife takes an off for even one day, sir, everything will be put on hold. Not just on hold, everything will fall apart. She is a woman but she has ten hands. A housewife is akin to Goddess Durga, sir. Durga. Sir, are you ready to order? We have received news from our sources just now that the Police have found a woman's corpse from Phool ghat in Kolkata. Her name is Sharmila Chatterjee. She was a teacher MA school in. Sharmila Chatterjee had been missing for the past six days. The Police have clearly stated this is the doing of that common man - who has spread terror through Kolkata. - Durga? ?? It is so late. Why are you watching TV so late at night? Mom, there was a teacher in Joy's school who went missing a few days ago. Today they learned that the common man murdered her. How can I send Joy to school? It is so scary. Don't be afraid. Joy will be fine. However, one woman or another will fall prey to the common man. What can one do? I feel if I were a Policewoman or a Special agent instead of a housewife I would nab him in two days, shove him in jail and stop this bloodshed. But what can I do? ???Bengali I'm just a housewife. ???Bengali Get some sleep. Glory to Durga! I came here to see you, sir. Rangeela. You mean to say you knew I would be here? You follow me everywhere I go, sir. I am bound to find you anywhere I go. Hey. Very smart! Well, I'm glad you came to see me. That is progress. Now take on the mission as well. I am tired of changing all these getups. Tell me when you're going to come round. - Right now, sir. - Huh? Seriously? You need to put me on a training refresher course because it has been many years, sir. No. No. No. No. If you are put on the training refresher, then everyone will know. And your identity could be compromised. No. No. No. No. No. No. This common man hasn't spared the lives of any of our agents. I cannot allow this. Listen. You must have a special phone given to you by the Special force. I do. Great! Leave it exactly where it is. Forget about it. This contains a new phone. This will be your phone. Okay? Flowers. Flowers. They will fall. They are blessed. Easy, easy I shall call you on this number when I need to get in touch with you. Okay? And if you need to call me, just dial 9-9-9. Okay? Pay attention to me now. We have received information from Intelligence That a parcel will be picked up at 8:30 tonight from Victoria Memorial. Just trace it and report to me. 8:30? It is dark outside, sir. I am terrified of the dark, sir. Didn't I tell you In any case, sir, 8:30 is impossible. I have got to serve dinner to my father-in-law at 8:30 else he gets acidity, sir. - Acidity? - Yes, sir. I am assigning you to a mission and you are playing house with me? No. 8:30.. ?? Durga! It is 8:30. Give me my dinner. Yes, dad. I'm bringing it. Durga. ???Bengali Look at how much weight you've put on. You eat and rush to work. You will look like an uncle soon. Come with me. Let's go for a walk. Come on. Come on. Come on. - Let's go for a walk. Come. Come. - Are you out of your mind? ?? Snack. Let me get a snack. Did you come here to get a snack or for a walk. Just two minutes. I'll buy the snack and we'll go. Listen. Make it sour. - Make it nicely. - No snacks. No snacks. Walk. Walk. Let's go for a walk. Hey! This is not a good place for a walk. In front of Victoria Memorial. You are insane! What is this place we've come to from Victoria Memorial? Shh. You shouldn't talk so much when you're walking. Look at how silently that man is walking. You won't lose weight if you walk in this manner. Where are you taking me? ?? It is nice and windy, isn't it? That's right. Let's go home now. - Yes, let's go. Let's go home. - Yes, let's go. Come. What's the matter? Shall we go round once? Let's go round once again. ?? ?? ?? Hey. Stop. Stop. I've had enough. I can't take another step. This is not the right kind of place to walk. I am going to book a taxi. Come with me if you want. Yes. Okay. Let's book a taxi. Yes. Let's go. We have to get to the main street first. - Come. Come. Come. - Please let's go. Taxi! Stop. Durga! Why did you take your husband with you on the mission? I told you I am afraid of the dark. But you have a gun, don't you? I cannot operate a mixer correctly. How do you expect me to use a gun? I don't want any excuses! Now listen to me! Meet me outside video shop number 5 outside Sonagachi at 5 pm tomorrow. - Where? - And please don't bring your husband, your in-laws, maid, your child or the milkman with you. I'm hanging up now! Hello? Oh.. ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? ?? What do you charge for one hour? What?! You think I am bootie? I am an agent. Get that? - But you are a lady. - So what if I am a lady? Why are you discriminating? Everything is possible these days. Do you get that or not? Yeah. - I get it. - Okay. Show me a good piece then. I only supply males. Boys only. What? Are you interested or not? Or you may get lost! It's business time. Don't ruin it. Go! - It's like this. - What? I am a modern customer. I see. I don't discriminate between men and women. - I see. - Either is good for me. Do you understand? So, where is the bootie? - Boys. - Boys. What? Rangeela. My mate is here. Do you know what the time is? How can you make the customer wait? Do you think you are Hrithik Roshan? - Custom.. - Silence! Do not open your mouth in the presence of the customer. Here's the bootie. He will take 5000 for one hour. Hotel charges extra. What? Okay. He is older but let me take a look. Turn around. - Will do. - Scram! Do I look like bootie to you? I look like bootie to you? Get lost! Come on inside! ?? "The smart cookie!" - ?? You're laughing? What if the biker had taken me with him? I would have stopped the bike from leaving - and taken the money in advance. - Perfect! Anyways, Durga, finally meet the team. Oh.. Okay. Let it be. Let it be. - Kajal. - Hi. Roy has gone to bring tea. - No, I don't want tea. - I do. I drink tea. He's gone to get it for me. Okay. So, team, as Durga said, she saw the man enter Kolkata girls college. I suspect the common man will use Kolkata girls college as his base To do something big. I have learned that a women empowerment program is held for one month every year at Kolkata girls college. Mostly housewives enroll in it. I have enrolled your name in it. And you will be joining next Monday. - Jo.. Jo-Jo.. - Joining. Me? Dev will never allow me, sir. What made you think I would allow you? Did you ask me before applying? I just thought I could learn something new and earn a little money at the same time. How the hell are you playing! Huh? What? Money? You want to earn money? Really? One has to work to earn money. Work. Have you ever worked in your life? All you know is household chores, which you are doing now. There is no need to learn something new. And if you have spare time on your hands then we can have one more child. Shot! ?? ?? ?? ???Bengali ???Bengali ???Bengali ???Bengali What are you doing over here, mom? What does that mean? Can't I visit my son's shop? I don't mean that. It's your will. You can come anytime you wish. But.. Hold on. How did you remember that you left home to come here? It takes one hour to reach here from home. But it took me two hours. After getting into the car I forgot where I was going. I even had an argument on the way with the driver but your dad gave him the address of this warehouse and also how to remind me if I forget. When I arrived here and saw you my 40 year old memory was refreshed. But why did you bother to come this far? Explain that to me. What would I do if you had a problem on the way, m.. Tea. Okay. - Here. Drink it. - Thank you. And how could dad let you come here with the taxi driver? Hold on. What do you mean, how can he let me come here? Is your father my master? He is my husband. He is not my owner. I came here of my own free will. How can he decide what I can or cannot do? In fact, as a husband he should support my decision. He should stand by me. And that's exactly what he did. He called a taxi for me. He helped me into the taxi and gave instructions to the driver. He did not prevent me. I wanted to leave and he helped me. What else could a wife ask for? Tell me. Although there are women who don't have such husbands. Their husbands prevent them from doing everything. They underestimate them. Also, there are some rascals who think women are simply baby making machines. ???Bengali They have no idea what a woman is capable of doing. ???Bengali But I am pleased there is no such man in my house. Your father is so nice. You extend so much support to Durga. Not just Durga. You have employed so many women in your warehouse. I'm so proud of you, my son. That reminds me. Durga told me she is going to join a women's empowerment program. I liked the idea. I told her to do it. Do what you want, my dear. I know my son. He will support you in all your decisions. He will never let me down. ???Bengali Tomorrow is the first day of the program. You must call a taxi for Durga. Don't forget that, son. Taxi! Are you free? Where? Kolkata girls college? How did you know? Just get in. Don't worry. Get in. Let's go. I am from the special forces too. Very nice to meet you. Listen up. I have some fresh briefing for you. I am checking the profile of every person of Kolkata's girls college. I will inform you if I get suspicious about anyone. Okay. For now, I have something for you. Here. Wear it. It will record whatever you see hereafter. ???Bengali And here's a gun. Yours must be an old one. - Yes. - It is loaded. Thank you. Look. We are here. All the best, madam. Jai Hind. Jai Hind. I don't think it's her. Sir, to the right of the screen. Durga, what brings you here? It's her neighbour. Ayesha, I have joined the women empowerment program going on here. Move on. Move on. All the best. - Thank you. - See ya. Where are you from? - Hello. - Hello. ???Bengali ???Bengali Okay. Hello. Hello, ladies. Welcome to our women empowerment program at the Kolkata girl's college? Sir, we have their profiles. My name's Aditya. And the girls call me Adi fondly. Today it is my honour and privilege to introduce to you Ajay sir. Ajay sir is a very senior and experienced social worker who has conducted women empowerment programs like this, rather bigger than these all over the country. And we are really fortunate he has agreed to come here as a visiting faculty. And conduct this one with me. Ajay sir. It gladdens me when I meet women like you. Who want to do something in life. Want to create an identity for themselves. And I will try my best in achieving your goals. This was our introduction. Now you introduce yourselves one by one. Let's start with you. Please. Myself Hamida. And I was 17 when my father fixed my marriage. I wanted to study. What did you want to study? Something related to business. There is this small village in Dhaka Bangladesh. I come from there. Women like me do great embroidery work there. So I had imagined I would sell dresses and sari made from those clothes with them. But... Hamida, you are still alive. So keep your dream alive. Right? Your business will start for sure. We will help you. Thank you. Introduce yourself. I am Kavita. I am a grandma. A grandmother. I am 67. But I want to sell 'Mishti.' - Introduce yourself. - I like beauty parlour. I am really fond of jewellery designing. I want to start a business. You please. I am Durga. Mrs. Durga Das. I am a housewife. Why are you sitting back? Did you want to do something before becoming a housewife? I am not sure. I mean I haven't given it a thought. One plate 'Puchka' please. Sweet or spicy? Do you guys always land up out of the blue? Now we can't have a meeting with you at the office, right? Who knows how many double agents might be hiding. And if we inform you about the meeting beforehand you'd most definitely bring someone from your family along. So I am going to land up out of the blue hereafter. You have always landed up out of the blue. Fine. It's never too late to do something. Tell me. What info do you have from the college? Well, I found everything to be normal. But Adi is a little weird. We need to gather more info on him. I guess everyone is waiting for you to find out. Right? You want me to do everything in one day. But you won't give me a refresher. How do I do it by myself? You will have to do it by yourself. I can't give you the refresher now. And if you want a refresher do it yourself. Love you, mamma. Hey... "Life is a fair. Burst all the balloons. " "Why are you surprised at yourself? Missy." "You do as you please. You don't look back. " "She is one amazing lady. The clever missy."

I am off to Durgapur. My grandma has taken ill suddenly. - So... - Oh. Okay. See you. - Have a safe journey. - Yes. I can't talk now. I'll call you later. Yes? What is it? I can't talk loudly. Speak a little louder. Arihant. Shop number 34. Kumartully. What time? At 6. In the middle of the market. Are you crazy? How is this possible? Okay. Got it. Bye. Sir, you do not understand. I can't go to Kumartully to keep watch on them. My mother-in-law is alone at home. Durga, we are this close. Instead of discussing your in-laws, go follow him. I'll get the back-up team ready. Hello. Hello. Listen. Come outside the college. Do you know Adi? - Adi who? - Adi. I'll send you his photo via whatsapp. - Okay. - Wait. He is here. He is off to Kumartully. Take him there. Sir, sign here. Hello. Madam. What happened? - Thank you. - Why did you go silent? - Do you see him? - Yes, I have spotted him. I see him. I am coming. Want to go somewhere? Will you? Of course. I run this taxi to ferry people. Let's go. Where to? Kumartully? How do you know? No. I was going there. So I thought you might too. Mother... ???Bengali ???Bengali Mother, come on. I want a cigarette? Cigarette? Since when? Come on. What's the harm in smoking a cigarette? Your son will kill me if I let you smoke. Come on. I said no. Brother, watch her. I'll be back in five minutes. Do not give her the cigarette. Okay? - Do not smoke? - No, I won't. - I'll be right back. - Okay. ???Bengali Manali. Manali. Manali. Manali. Manali. Manali. Do you sell holiday packages on the streets these days? What's the cost of your package? Do you want the entire package? What? I want to go on the trip and come back as well, right? So why would I want half the package? I mean isn't the entire package a bit too much for you alone. Why would I buy for me alone? I want it for the entire family. Hey, I have a 6 year old grandson. He should enjoy. Suggest some package on those lines. - Can I get a 100 rupee parcel? - Sure. How can you jump in? We are talking. Get back. Get back. Now tell me. For how many nights and days is your package? It depends on your capacity. - Capacity? - Yes. Here you go. Show it. What is it? Show me. - What... - Good Lord. I see. So you are selling this package. You are selling this package in the middle of the street. Listen. What are you doing? You are spoiling the kids here. I'm sorry. You are getting me all wrong. Listen. People... - Durga, you. - Police. - Arrest him. - Leave me. Who are you? Why have kidnapped me? We know that you are the 'common man.' Common man? Are you nuts? I don't understand. Don't waste my time. I have left my mother-in-law at the temple. I have 20 minutes. Cooperate or else... But you... - Darn you. - No, he'll talk. I am not the 'common man.' And I have come here to find out who the common man is. I am a cop. You may call the Lal Bazaar police. How is this possible? We have verified your background. You'll obviously find my cover if you verify. Look, I had intel that the owner of a big women's rights NGO was supposed to come at Arihant shop no. 34. Who is the target. So you went there alone to save her like a super cop? No. There were cops inside that shop. Sir, please call the commissioner. He'll tell you everything. Hello. We have arrested Aditya from Kumartully. Yes. Yes. Kolkata girl's college. Okay. Wow. She is doing it so well. This will do. I really love colours. Ladies, may I have your attention please? I am really happy to say that the CM has accepted the invitation to be the chief guest at the final day's function. We need to prepare for it in full swing. The function should be awesome. Okay? Sir, what else could be the reason for Kolkata girl's college to be on the radar? I am sure he is targeting the CM. Tell her that she can't come here. What are you saying, chief? I get these threats on a daily basis. I can't sit at home scared. I will have to continue my work. In fact, we can look at this invitation as an opportunity. Look, if I go there the 'common man' will come there. We have cops. Z-security. Special forces. You can catch him very easily. Hello. Durga, you and Adi come and see me at 8 am tomorrow. Not at 8. At 8... Hello. Hello. Sir. Now I should leave my work and go drop him to school. No. Just for today. I have to go to college early today. That's why. Or I would have taken him. I told you. Instead of fulfilling your responsibilities the women empowerment movement you have taken up is useless. This is your life, Durga. Try to understand. Go early if you have to. But I don't have time to do your housewife chores. Please. No problem. If you and papa don't have the time to drop me to school then I'll not go to school today. This is the smallest favour I can do you. I see. Such a big favour. No. We will not be able to repay it. You please go to school. Come on. Ready. Papa, give me the phone. - No. - Once. Just one game. - Only one. - No. Hey... Joy. Joy. - What is he doing? - I'll see. Joy. Joy, come here. Joy. Mama, let me play a game please. Please. Joy. - Joy, return my phone. I am warning you. - Papa, one game. Mamma, please. One game. Go inside. Durga is just not picking up. - Good morning, sir. - Good morning. Good morning. Where is Durga? Durga. No idea. She has been absent since a few days. Okay. Are you sure Deb is dangerous? From what you are saying, he seems like... An idiot. I know. He is. But I wonder where he went that night at 3 with the headlights of his car off. When I asked him indirectly he reacted as if he knows nothing. It could be his wife. I cross checked it too. Deb said his wife can't drive. In fact, his wife can't do anything. That is why she comes to you in the college to be empowered. Anyway, I know nothing about his plan as of now. So... I don't want to take any risk before the main mission. Kill him if you want to. Make it look like an accident. The common man's terror is still looming large. He has kind of turned Kolkata into his playground. Be it night or day, he is targeting every woman who... Who is this crazy man killing woman randomly? Why are they not able to nab him? Do you actually want him caught? Yes. He should be caught and punished. Do house chores and don't step out. What will you do if you find him? I'll give him a tight slap first. And then get him arrested. People who do not let their girls and women step out of the house. People who stop them taking up jobs or even expressing their views. Sir, what are you doing here? Out. Go out. What are you doing here? I have come to sell fish. I am thinking of leaving the force and start selling fish. It is quite profitable. Do I look crazy to you? Strange. You report that there is a threat to the CM and then you disappear. Why aren't you taking our calls? - I can't do it. - You can't do it? - I can't do it. - What do you mean? I got talked into this by you and started But I had no idea of things that were happening in my house since then. But what is happening? Tell me. There is something. Tell me. - There is a problem. - What problem? My husband is having an affair. I want to fix it. Leave. - Fix it? - Yes. And the mission? Are you nuts? You are selling stale fish and you are calling me nuts? Return the money and take back your stale fish. - It is fresh fish. Have a look. - It is fresh. It is alive. No, it's stale. Listen, if your husband is an ass... a cheater, then so be it. He is not your husband anyways. He is a cover. Right. Everything is a cover. I am a human being. Is that a cover too? It is my household. My family. Relax, madam. Relax. We can't take the fish back. You will have to. ?? Look, you are not that weak. If you think your cheater husband is above yourself, this country and this mission then I have nothing to say. How can you let yourself become so weak? You are fire. Fire. - Will you help me? - Sure. Durga, did you hear? Ajay sir will not be becoming to college for two days. Well, her mother just passed away. What? How? She slipped in the bathroom and her head hit the wall. - Oh God. - She died on the spot. Show it. - Yes. It's really nice. - Yes, it's really good. Tell me something. What happened at the last minute? ?? Look, I have to go. I have to. Listen. You can't do this to me. I... I'll come tomorrow. Come on. Come here, baby. - Bye. - Just a minute. Go. Go. Hey. How rash are you driving? Get in. Get in. How are you driving a car? Get in. What's going on? Unlock it. My luggage is in the room. I mean what is going on? I don't get it. Go faster. What's going on? Who is he? And why does he want to kill us? Not us. He wants to kill you. Me? Like really? Your actions are such. Do you know who sent them after you? Your girlfriend Ayesha. What nonsense. I should say that to you. You like doing shady things, right? Now save your life if you can. But there is nothing like that. I mean nothing. You are not just a cheat but shameless too. You are still lying. I know everything. And if you are telling the truth get off the car. And the guy in the black car will take care of you once and for all. Oh no. Go. Go. You lied to me that you can't drive. So what is this? Leave alone driving. You are making the car fly. If I don't they will bump you off. And there is a huge difference between your lie and my lie. Come on. So what? Yes, I lied to you. I ended up having an affair with Ayesha. It happens. I am a man. ?? I am a man. Did I tell you to join college? Did I? Why did you stop the car? What are you doing? What... They are coming for us. - Come out. - Just a minute. - Come out. - What are you doing? Listen to me. You scum. Stop. Durga. ?? Easy. Easy. It hurts. Hey. Call your boss. Tell her that you have killed Deb. Job is done. Call her or do you want some? I'm calling. Call her. Hello. Boss, job is done. - I have... - I know. But you will never see me again. No, sir. No one's going to fire. Why not? Your cover is blown. We have to eliminate him. Just a minute. What's going on, Durga? Four men have their guns pointing at your husband. - What the hell have you done? - Shut up. Quiet. You are so shameless. What have I done? What have I done? Did I have an affair? What would you have done if I had ended up having an affair? You are responsible for whatever that is happening, Deb. What did you say to me in the car? I got busy. So you ended up having an affair? I am a man. It happened. I couldn't tell you that I am special force agent. So does that justify you having an affair? I took you off the street. Saved your life and got you here. If not for me, you would have been dead. You should thank me. But you are blaming me instead. Four men have their guns pointing at you. No one's firing only because of me. Got it? A man would rather die than let go of his male ego. Should I shoot? Should I shoot? Tell me. Should I shoot? Talk. We have gagged him. How is he going to talk? It is the fault of us ladies. You should not dedicate yourself to this extent. Because no matter how much we do all we get to hear is we are mere housewives. Today you saw what a housewife can do. Sir, take him. Finish him. Quiet. Idiot. If she had to kill you she would not have saved you from certain death. Stay here quietly till the mission is complete. Take him. Come on. Come on. Come on quietly. - Come on. - Come on. - Durga. - Yeah, sir. I am sorry. But I don't understand something. Why does Ayesha want to kill Deb? Sir, I feel the common man too had the same misunderstand as you that Deb s the agent. Because for him women are ass... Nothing. I guess common man didn't want to take any chance. So he must have told Ayesha to watch Deb. This has worked in our favour. We can get to the common man through Ayesha. Trident. 2...3...4. and 2...3 and small. Wide. Stretch. Hold. Yeah. Stay. - Hello. Hi. Hi, everyone. - Hello. Hello, sir. How is the practice going? - Really well. - All set? - Yes. - It looks really nice. I just saw. - Thank you. - Thank you, sir. Okay. Bring it. You'll be given a trident each during the show. Okay. - You have to fit these tridents in these blocks. - Okay. Okay, sir. The moment you fit it; the confetti will blast. Oh, I see. - You can do it, right? - Sure. - Hope you won't get nervous? - No, sir. Okay. Good. Good. Continue. - It is looking good. - Thank you, sir. During the show these blocks should be in the centre of the stage. Do you understand or are you just nodding? ?? and small wide. Stretch. Hold. Yeah stay. Durga. Ayesha. What are you doing here? Well, I... I came to check the costumes for the final. Sir told us they should be here. Are you leaving? Okay. Okay. Where could the costumes be according to you? They won't be in it. It's really small. I should check the other room. Right? You fooled everyone brilliantly. And your stupid husband paid the price. You work for the common man being a woman. You are smart. You are capable. Ayesha. It's still not too late. Become our witness. Whatever he is doing is correct. I haven't even told him about you yet. I'll take your dead body to him now. To give him a surprise. - Kajal. - Yes, sir? Did you find anything on Ayesha's phone? Nothing, sir. As if she was not connected to anyone except Durga's husband and a few others from the college. Anyways, look, I am worried about just one thing now. Ayesha must have told the common man about you. She hasn't. The problem is when the common man gets to know of Ayesha's death he'll suspect me. He won't. We will make it look like an accident. ???Bengali ???Bengali ???Bengali ???Bengali Ladies and gentlemen, today is the final day of the women empowerment program at Kolkata girl's college.

There has been a massive confusion. I am not... What are you talking about? What evidence do you have that I am a terrorist or the common man? That scar on your arm. And you fussing over the confetti. Walking out on our performance. What's happening? Are you kidding me? Scar. Confetti. Is this proof? What an amazing investigation. What a smart investigation. Who the heck are you? I am a special force agent. You are a special force agent. ?? So you should know that a scar and confetti is not proof enough to prove that I am an internationally wanted criminal. Or a psycho killer. These are all circumstantial evidences. Okay. Arrest me. Take me. We'll have some snacks together once I am out on bail in four hours. Wait. Wait. Leave me. He is right. We will never be able to prove that he is the common man. We are not fighting against this man. But against the mentality of men like him. We have to kill that mentally. We will beat him too. In the exact way he beat up every woman before killing them. Don't worry. Everyone's going to leave. Ma'am. Let's go, everyone. But how is this possible? An Indian housewife is more than enough to punish him. Come on. Let's go. - Give me your phone. - Huh?
