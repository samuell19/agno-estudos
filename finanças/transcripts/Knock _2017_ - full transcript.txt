It is quieter here than the mass. What has he done to you? - Nothing. It has not yet seen. He is expected. - Ah ! It's with that? - With Cuq. - Very good ! She will watch the quick. - 3 000 francs ? This is the price of two fat pigs and two calves! - Yes. - It is a desolation. - Yes. That's what we'll do. I'll put you under observation. It will cost you nothing. In a few days, you'll see how it goes and you decide. - Yes. That's good, that's fine. - Bye Madam. - Thank you. - Shit. - Next. - Thank you, Julius. - Oh well no!

Soft music ... - Expirez. Well, same thing. Well, stand up. Cough. Here. We'll better. We did well to treatment. - You are right. It can not be treated fairly. It is too hard leads. - Excellent reasoning. - Of course I reason. If I told you that one day, the Prefect in person was at the town hall in the marriage hall. And... - He saw right away who it was.

And me. - It was boring to be married, it is even more to be a widow. As I am very rich, men are interested in my money. This is hardly flattering. I'm bored, I'm bored. So I play. - What? - I put. On the right, the middle, rarely left. - Our friend comes along to place 500,000 francs in shares of coal. - 500,000 francs? It is enormous. - Yes. - For you and me. But for our widow, that's ... The tenth of his fortune? The twentieth ? - Mrs. Pons is especially the good fairy of Saint-Maurice. It opens quietly for charitable causes.
