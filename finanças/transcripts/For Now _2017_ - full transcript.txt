So I'm like worried. So I think I should just like not eat for like a week and then I'll be fine. - No. (bubbling) (coughing) (groaning) - We're starting in L.A., right and then we're going to reserve.

Can you stop him really quick? Why didn't you stop him? Guy! Guy? - Babe. Babe. - Yeah? - Why would you bring me home to somebody, you're selling your house. - Let's not talk about it, let's not talk about it. No I don't want to talk about it. I don't know what you're talking about. Let's just like, - I don't wanna talk about it either 'cause I never wanna talk about it because you're done. - Yeah, we're never gonna talk about it. - So I'm gonna go home. - Okay so I'm gonna, can we like, can I go back? Can we please? Agh, please don't do that. I fucking hate when people fucking walk away from me when I'm talking to them! Ugh!

(splashing) - I don't wanna fucking hear that shit. She's been in and out of shit for like a month. - Kane. She has just had a car accident. She's homeless. - And then she gets fucked up and then she tells me, like, - Just for this weekend. - [Kane] I don't wanna hear anymore. - Just for this weekend. - [Katherine] Hannah, can you bring me some water, please? - Yeah yeah yeah. Hold on, where's your water bottle? - Don't give her that one. That's mine, dude. - I am so nervous. I don't know why, I don't know why. - [Kane] You haven't seen him in so. (squealing) Hold on, hold on, hold on. - So I smell like dick, where's the spliff? No, I'm kidding. (chuckling) (growling) - [Hannah] Okay, see how much you can take it. - [Conner] All right. - Okay. - That's what she said. Katherine, why are you sitting back there? Took you that long to-- - 'Cause Bruv is sitting in the chair. - [Hannah] So oblivious. - [Conner] Bruv! (screeching) - Yeah, dude! - [Conner] That made so much more sense, right, cause, yeah because. - [Katherine] Conner, you didn't even see he was sitting there? - [Hannah] The whole time. - [Conner] I was so excited about you. - [Kane] So dude, San Francisco. Ready for your audition? - We'll see, I mean. I'm gonna go and we'll have a look at it and then um, - [Hannah] No, and then we'll audition, get in. - Of course audition. Of course get in. - [Hannah] Of course. - Of course. - [Kane] That part's a given. - [Hannah] No, that's a given. - Very hard to get in. So I don't know about that. - [Hannah] What, what do you mean? - [Kane] Is it really? - Yeah it is. San Francisco is Royal Ballet, English National Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, Australia Ballet, Boston Ballet. - Yeah, but you're brilliant. You're brilliant so that's not gonna be a problem. - But I wouldn't get your hopes up too much. - Oh, by the way. I actually, I had started already looking for apartments and stuff but this is the schedule. This is the schedule because you've gotta move over once you get in quite quickly. So I've got a whole package in my bag but this is just for the trip. And then, yeah, yeah. - [Conner] Thanks, sis. - You're welcome. - [Conner] Thanks. - [Kane] She's very organized. - She's super, super pumped. - [Kane] Super pumped. - Super pumped. - [Hannah] Duh. - Duh? - [Hannah] We might be living in the same state. ♪ Surely everything can wait ♪ ♪ Just look cold and of money ♪ - Okay, okay. I know I keep bothering you about this but I just like, I don't understand because like he, okay so we're really sorry about last night and then he was like, it's okay, shit happens. And then he's like asking me for his jacket and asking us to like leave it out. And so then I'm telling him that we can't leave it out for him because we're like on the road. And I was like I'll just give it to you when we're back in, when I get back in town. I mean we could go to the movies or something. He's like, oh can one of your friends drop it off? Like, can one of your friends leave it outside? I'm like no, we're on the road. - Katherine, I don't know, I don't know. Why are you asking me? - No, but I don't get it because then he sent me like a real cute emoji. - [Hannah] I'm so hungry. - [Katherine] Me too. Let's get in already. - [Kane] Yes, I'm getting us in, I'm getting us in. - [Hannah] Go to the cafe for pizza. - Just, get out. Just, oh Jesus. - Oh my god, it's so pink. (laughing) This is cool. (laughing) Okay. Hey guess what. I'm testing for a role next week for a big TV show. - [Conner] No fucking way! - Yes, yes, I think I've got the role 'cause it's just a model. - [Katherine] What's in the box? - [Hannah] What? - Um, oh, just um some stuff for a little shoot we're gonna do. Woo! So I need to take some photos for a film pitch and you guys are gonna help me, all right? - And oh, just a question. There's only one bed. - Yeah, well this was kind of the best room for what I'm trying to do, so. I just figured we would. - Where are they gonna sleep? - Well, see I thought ahead, I brought us the, - The heavy mattress I was carrying. - Brought us the air mattress, that's what that was. - So are they gonna sleep in the same bed? - Oh I could sleep on the couch. - We could share one, I don't care. I mean, whatever. - All right, all right. - Okay, whatever works is fine. - Okay, okay cool, okay. (light music) (giggling) - Like, oh no, my film's gonna fall apart if we don't get this test footage that I never told you about.

Congratulations. Wrap on set. Well done. - Hannah, stop. - Katherine, just ignore her. She does this when she drinks too much. Can you just sit down? - Kane, I never drink. - But when you do you fucking hammer in. For some reason it's like some coping mechanism. - I wonder why. 'Cause my boyfriend calls me fat all the time. - I don't call you fat all the time. - Okay come on, let's just take the picture-- - Hannah can you please come over here? - Hannah, be careful. - Yeah I'm done. I'm done, I'm done. I'm done. - Are you serious? - [Hannah] Yeah, I'm good. - Are you being serious right now? - [Conner] She's done with the bottle. - [Katherine] Hannah, come on. (Conner laughing) - [Kane] I thought you'd wanna be on this thing. - How many of these do we have? - You don't even care if I fail this. - You pick on me all the time. - Do you know if I don't get these photos off do you know, do you know? - Katherine, where's the wine? - I don't know, just you have to-- - God! Do I have to find it myself? - We'll just let you guys settle it. Just chill out. - Where is it? I need it. - [Kane] Calm down, calm down. - [Hannah] No, you calm down! You've been picking on me-- - [Kane] Don't point that corkscrew at me. - Oh, oh my god I'm gonna stab you in the heart with a corkscrew. (waves crashing) - So, um, I was thinking that like I probably won't see you dance before you go, right? - No, you won't. - What if you were to dance for me now? - Where? - Here. - Where? - Here. - Where? On the concrete? You want me to fucking break my shins on the concrete here? - Oh, come on. You don't have to like do like the fanciest shit you know. - [Conner] Dude, look at all the pigeons. - Oh my god, it's daa-- - Do you want me to dance with the pigeons? - No, please don't dance with the pigeons. - You don't wanna dance with the pigeons? - Don't dance with the pigeons. - There they go. - I'm like legit scared of birds. Dude, look, this looks like a stage. Okay, this is too perfect. Come on, I feel like we literally just walked on to a stage. - All right, fine. Want me to dance? - Yes, I want you to dance. Oh shit. (birds flapping) - [Conner] But I'm gonna have to get naked for the pigeons. 'cause I can't dance in these. - Come on. - All right, fine. But I'm gonna have to get naked. - Okay. No, you're really gonna do, (giggling) No way. No way. - For the people. - No way. - It's all right, I got like long johns under. - Oh okay then dance for me, monkey. Dance, dance. - All right, if I do this, you gotta run through pigeons. - Okay but I have, I'm gonna do it after you dance. - All right, but if you don't you have to give me a blowjob. Yeah, that's the deal. - Okay, I'll run through the pigeons, Jesus. Okay, dance. Oh my god, you're such a performer. (clapping) Bravo, that was awesome. - There they go. Run through the pigeons. - They're not there. (laughing) - Give me a blowjob! - No! If I fell, would you catch me? - No. - Dude, you're so chill, like. You and Hannah seem like totally different. I guess like me and my sister are totally different too. - Does Hannah still get angry all the time? - I see like her and Kane argue a lot but like I don't know if it's just 'cause I'm there a lot lately. You know what I mean, like, stuff you're not supposed to see? Is that something she always did? - No it kind of started after the accident, I mean. - [Katherine] Your parents? - It didn't affect me so much 'cause I wasn't here you know when the coroner said everything that happened. She tells people it was a car accident but it wasn't. It was a bit more than that. It was, (sighing) so they went on a hiking trip and they got lost, they got caught off and they didn't have a beacon or anything like that to signal anybody. No cellphone reception, they got stranded, like a river came in between and cut them off. And they were there for a long time. And um, well they starved to death. - You're fucking lying. (laughing) You're lying. - I'm not, I'm not. - I thought you meant to say they were stranded on an island. (laughing) - No, but really they got cut off. They were skiing. And they got cut off on a mountain. That's how they died, they starved to death. - Are you serious? - It's not a joke. It's like, that's actually how they died. - Wait, why does Hannah say it's a car accident? - Because when she went to view the body, she was speaking to the coroner and the coroner had cut her up, my dad up and found everything inside. And apparently there was like bits of human flesh of my mom. - What?! - Yeah, they found little bits of my mom in dad and I understand why, I get it. Because of course he wants to stay alive for me and Hannah, right? Like if you're starving to death and you know you have two kids and you're gonna be the sole provider now, you would try and stay alive. But, yeah he died anyway. And a human thing that's still fucking with my sister is that I mean she can't really, I don't think she can come to terms with that and she feels like it was her fault in a way 'cause she was the one that received the news. (laughing) I'm fucking with you. It was a car accident, it's fine. I was fucking (laughing) - Oh my god, what the fuck is wrong with you? - It's too easy to do this to you. - Dude, seriously, that's fucked up. Are you fucking scared of me? - I am fucking scared of you now. - Ahaha, I'm crazy! - Gullible as well. - [Katherine] Shut up. (light music) (Kane and Hannah mumbling) - What the fuck?

Stop, stop, stop fighting, stop. - We're not fighting. - [Katherine] I don't like it. - [Conner] It's just Bruv. - [Hannah] Just Bruv. Right? - Oh my god, stop. - [Conner] Get her, Bruv, get her. Fucking get her Bruv, get her. - [Hannah] Bruv compels you, Bruv compels you, Bruv compels you! - Why are you all into that stuffed animal so much, that's so like, I don't know. I think that's childish. I've never been into stuffed animals. Why are you guys so into it? - [Hannah] It's Bruv. - It's Bruv, not a stuffed animal. - [Katherine] What's that mean? - It's a Bruv, it's a brother. - Yeah I know you guys have had him forever but like why, you know why that's, like what is the big deal? - Well. The paramedic um, so essentially, apparently when, when I was like rolling in the air like flipping in the air in the car with mom and dad, Bruv, I was holding him and apparently he must have slipped out of my arms and created a barrier between me and the glass. Because if he hadn't I would have been brain dead like my mum. And I think if he, I wasn't holding him, feeling like my family was still with me I'm not sure that I would have actually made it. He's really been there for us, he really, you know, he was on mom's stomach, right? - Right at the end. Right at the end, still there. - Because he saved her baby's life. And well you know, we pulled her off life support and she wasn't alone. (laughing) Oh my god. - [Conner] You fucking nailed that one! - You did not, you didn't even budge. I've never seen you, Katherine, come on. Hey you weren't the one who actually had to go through it. - [Katherine] Assholes. - It's all right, she'll be over it. (mumbling) - We'll get her again later. - Good job, Bruv. - Yeah man. (birds chirping) (bird squawking) - Doesn't it like feel so good when, - Dude, what are you doing? - Someone touches your head? But it feels different when someone else does it. - Where's Hannah? - I don't know. - Is she coming here? How far behind you, Katherine, how far behind you is she? - I don't know. - I need you to focus for a second ,okay? How far behind you was she? - I don't know. You should wear your hair down all the time. - I do wear my hair down. I do wear my hair down a lot. Should I do it right here? I thought right here is a nice little spot.

Because I understand. - This is my jam. - Just go dance. - [Kane] Cut. - Okay, cool. - [Kane] Katherine, that was really good. - Okay, come on. We got it. - Dude we could shoot your self tape. - Guys, come on. (energetic music) ♪ Save our souls ♪ - Hey Hannah, do you have any signal on your phone? - Yeah. - You do? - Yeah. - [Kane] Hannah? - [Hannah] Yes? - [Kane] Should I do the sauce in a separate pan? Or should I just pack it? - No. - No? - [Hannah] Kane, figure it out. My person is exhausted. - It's one and up. One on two. - [Hannah] Figure it out, go cook and get him. Katherine, what are you? Just use my phone. - I can't use your phone 'cause I'm trying to see if I got a text message so I have to check my phone. - [Hannah] Can you just text the person from my phone? - Dude, where's the light? - No, 'cause I want to see if they wrote back. - [Hannah] Okay. - I don't think you understand I need cellphone signal. I got no wifi. I just like, it's my iMessage. - I'll manage, thank you. - That person doesn't have an iphone so he'll send me regular text message. Does no one care? Honestly I keep searching for signal, thanks guys. - Oh. (roaring) Honey bear! Here you go, honey bear. Ah, yum. What honey bear. Bye. (laughing) Whoah dude, look at how many of these you've done. Is this the schedule that I created? - No, no. No, Hannah no! - No, hey, give me a sec. - Whoah, don't spoil the weed, don't spoil the weed. - This is not meant to be used for cutting up weed. - I don't care. I have it. I was looking at it while I rolled the weed. - Put this in your bag where it belongs. I don't wanna see this anywhere but here, okay? - Ugh! Fucking awesome, great. - What, are you okay? - Hayaaah. - [Hannah] Hey, what's up? - Um, so the place that I was gonna get just fell through. - [Hannah] What? - They like made it seem like the landlord like wouldn't run a credit check and she did and 'cause of all my student loans I didn't get approved, so now I have to find another place. - [Hannah] Dude, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. - The Kane Hannah Katherine show continues. - Yeah. You know you can stay with us, right? - [Katherine] No. Let me get by though. - No go. No, it's cool. - Katherine, of course you can keep staying with us. It's more than fine. - No, I've been there too long and I've gotta find somewhere. I can probably crash with Christina for a while or something. - [Kane] Has she got a one bedroom too? - [Katherine] No, she lives with two other roommates. - Well, maybe it's more room, I dunno. But you're welcome to stay with us, I'm just, - [Katherine] Cheers. - Cheers! - [Conner] Yeah, cheers. - So what are we cheering to? Wait, wait wait. Whoah, eyes, eyeballs, eye balls. What are we cheesing to. - Uh, Conner moving to America! - Conner going to San Francisco Ballet Company! - Katherine finding an apartment. - That's more prescient. Cheers, cheers, cheers, cheers, cheers, cheers. - So is that why you were looking for the reception? - [Katherine] Yes and no. - [Hannah] What do you mean? - I was trying to see if Guy had rang back. - [Hanna] Rang back to what? - To a text I sent. - [Hannah] Oh. - It was a one night thing, right? - Can we not? Like can we not? - [Kane] Then we drop to the theater and it's like she's sitting in the row behind him and I've seen the guy before, I know what he looks like. - [Conner] Did you prebook the tickets? - [Hannah] Yes! - [Kane] So I like sit down. - [Hannah] Yes, she prebooked our tickets. She bought them for us. She convinced us to go with her. - I feel like the dick. I felt like a dick for saying this but like maybe he's just not that into you. It's like, - [Hannah] Kane, don't. - They made a movie about it. And it's, maybe he's just not that into you. But, in Katherine's defense. - Are you gonna keep going? - So difficult, Kane. That's just what you do. - What do you mean? Dude, I'm trying to, I'm being, I'm trying to be a friend. - [Katherine] You're trying to what, Kane? - I'm trying to be a friend. - You're trying to make fun of me in front of other people, that's what you're doing right now. - No, I mean, these are our people. Am I, in front of Hannah? Conner, all right. I know you don't know, but-- - You have such a fucking smirk on your face right now, don't even, 'cause you know exactly what you're doing. - I'm just like trying to be, like no one else will say this to you but I'm trying to help you as a, I promise you. I promise you, okay look, I promise you. I promise you, I promise you. Look, Katherine, I'm serious. - No one else will tell you this, Katherine. But I'm such a good friend that I'm gonna tell you 'cause I'm so great. I'm such a great fucking person. - Okay that sounded like a dick. - And I'm so fucking great. Oh my god, Kane! Oh my god, you're the best friend I've ever had! Nobody's ever been so honest with me. Thank you so much, Kane. Thank you so much. I'm so, I'm like beaming with happiness because I cannot believe I have such a great fucking friend in my life. - What are you laughing about, you agree with me. - Because it's fucking hilarious, it was funny, okay? It was funny, like what I just did right now was fucking funny. - I don't want any, I'm not trying to fight. Why are you turning this into a fight? - No one has ever said this to me before. - When can we talk normally? - And then I'm like, - When are you gonna listen to me? - Wait, he had said this to me a thousand times and why do I keep-- - Fucking hell, Katherine, listen to me. All right, I'm your fucking friend. - Okay, and you've said it to me a thousand times. Why do you have to fucking repeat it all the time in front of everyone? If you were a real friend, you'd have a conversation with me when there's not a fucking audience around. - This is not an audience, it's our family! - [Hannah] Calm down. - What, Conner's here, her brother. It's your best friend's brother. I didn't, what. Like what are you trying, you trying to impress him too? - Kane. - Are you trying to win him over and make him fall in love with you? - Oh, man, you're just like grabbing the, you're just fucking making the hole so much bigger right now. - You're clearly not self-aware enough to talk. You're clearly not self-aware enough to talk about this. - [Katherine] Keep going, let's see how deep this fucking hole can get. - What are you gonna do, stab me with a fork? - No. I'm just like. - [Kane] Why don't you just, why don't you just? - [Announcer] Now unfortunately when these also exploded, you should be looking at a small clearing in the bush right on the edge of the lake. That is where the channel used to run through. - [Katherine] You seriously have, like hello, join the party. Another one? Oh. - [Conner] Yeah, scorpions have six legs. - [Katherine] Yeah they have six legs. You're putting in eight. (Conner speaking in foreign language) - [Conner] Harry Potter. - [Katherine] Wait, do you really like Harry Potter? - [Conner] Yeah I really love, yeah, yeah. Number four, I fucking love number four. (mumbling) - [Katherine] Oh dude, Goblet of Fire? - [Conner] Yeah, Goblet of fire. - [Katherine] Oh my god, okay. So I read, I read the first three books as they came out when I was like 11, 12. And then, on the fourth one I stopped. Like, hey. - Hey, want some? - No, no, no. No. - Okay. - What was I talking about, oh. (bubbling) - Okay, no. - [Both] No. - What are you doing? Hannah, stop. - Wait. What? - I think your brother's really cute. - I know. - How do you know? - 'Cause I think he's cute. - Yeah he's, he's like duh he's cute. - Yeah. Yeah. - And so I'm gonna wake up one day and I'm gonna be 70 years old and I'm gonna roll over and no one's gonna be there because when I have these romances, these relationships that never went anywhere because I took my career over them. And you know, you turn around, you're like well at least I've dedicated to an art. Like okay, say I make 10 movies. What if no one sees them? - My artform is dead for me when I'm 34. It's gone. Like that's it, over. You're, there is a point when you get into your, above your 30s where you're like any moment this could stop. Any moment, I'm kind of looking for a job and I have no other source of employment other than my ballet career. So like, you can make films till you're 80s. I can make ballet till I'm 34. Stop being a whiny little bitch. - Did I mess up? - No, no, no, no. - Okay let's just move on. - Okay. Just forget I said it. - Okay. - It wasn't meant to be a whole discussion. - No, no, no. - Okay. - Um. - Are you gonna take more? Okay I definitely cannot keep up with you. (Kane groaning) Oh this fire is like really hot. - Guys this weed is seriously kicking in. Ooh! South Africa. - I think we're going to win the World Cup. And the husband who's upstairs and she's cheating on you, he comes downstairs and he takes the breakfast, he doesn't say his thank you and he fucks off to the pub. All different kinds of Scottish. So I don't know which blends I'm doing right now but it's somewhere, somewhere in the country. - [Katherine] It's so good. - Thank you. (giggling) Oh my god! - Shut up. - No, shut your fucking face up. - No you shut your fucking face. - You need to close your legs for like just like a second. - Just like talk for a second like can I just tell you? - I know you're sleeping with Justin next door and you just need to like close your legs and stop. Like just stop. - When somebody dies, their voice is the first thing that you forget. We're all on Facebook and there are photos of us there forever. And yet if I wanted to look up your voice, I might not be able to find it unless you posted videos on Facebook. But not everyone does audio recordings and so it's like. - Not people from like our parents' generationn. - [Kane] Yeah. - But it's crazy because if your parents died and then you never use Facebook that much then you wouldn't remember their voice. - It's not even like a, - Hey, do we have any voice recordings of mom and dad? - [Conner] I can't remember any. - I don't think I have. So I'm gonna forget what they sound like. - Do you still remember what they sound like? - Did you ever put up, 'cause I they never put my grandmother on tape and I always had these long discussions with her. - Me neither, oh my god, you're so right. - I don't remember what mom and dad sound like. Do you? - [Conner] I honest, I remember dad, to be honest. I remember dad. - This weed is seriously kicking in. It's starting to do that womp womp thing. - What? - Where it's like I'm zooming in but the ring around the circle that I'm seeing is zooming out. And it's, - What? (exhaling) - No, no, no, no, no. - I can't even swallow this. - Guys, he's not, he's actually gonna be. - Fuck, I'm gonna vomit again. I know I'm gonna vomit again. - No, no ,no, no, Kane. Do you need to go to the bathroom? - No, I'm good. (retching) - No, you're gonna make him go, I can just go back and do my part. - Conner, stop. (dramatic music) - Um, I feel like you've been flirting with me. - I feel like you've been flirting with me. - What? - Yeah. - What do you mean? - You know what I mean. - No. - Yeah. - I don't. - So we haven't been flirting for parts. - I don't know, I don't know if we have or not. - I think we have. I have been. But have you been? I think so. - Are we trying to be that subtle that we don't even know if the other is flirting? - Yeah, pretty much. - That's how subtle we've been for like, no, that's it. (laughing) - So? - Huh? - So? - So what? - Exactly, what do we do about it? (moaning) - [Conner] (groaning) oh shit, oh shit. Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit. The condoms. I don't have the condoms on. - [Katherine] What, what? - [Conner] Just wait, I don't have the fucking condoms on. - [Katherine] What? - [Conner] That's about yeah, just wait. - [Katherine] No, no, no, no. - [Conner] Just let me get it. Just wait, wait, wait. One sec. - [Katherine] Ay, no, no, no I just wanna be-- - [Conner] Oh that's got it, wait, wait, wait. - Oh god. - Shit, there. I think I got it on a bit. Good, there. - What the fuck? - I'm sorry. - What the fuck? - I'm sorry. - What the fuck? - No, I'm sorry. No, don't get angry. - Did you not know? - Don't get angry, don't get angry. - Did you not know? - No, it's fine, it's fine. - How did you not feel that happening? Oh, fuck, fuck. - It's fine, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine. Hey come on, come on, come on. Why are you panicking, why are you panicking? - Because now, oh my god. Now we have to get, no, oh fuck. - We just go in there. - I am not on the pill and now I have to go get Plan B and we're in the middle of fucking nowhere. - Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine. Fine. (thudding) Ah, fuck, fuck. Oh, it fucking burns. Oh, it fucking burns. (Hannah sobbing) - Babe? Shh, shh. Hey, it's just a dream, it's just a dream. Come here. It's just a dream, just a dream.

Everybody I'd just like to make a service announcement. - Dude, it's nice, I'm dry. I'm not complaining about it. - I'd like to let you know that one of our passengers, Kane Dennis has lost his balls. - Fuck off. - He dropped them somewhere here in the woods. - Whatever. - They're very salty. They're very pubey. - [Katherine] Yeah, just make sure that it's covered, okay? Put your jeans over your boot or whatever, just she cannot find out. Like, oh fuck. - [Hannah] Let's just forget our hopes and dreams and live in the woods. Wouldn't that be good? Ah, love it here. - Hey, um. Can you stay right here? - Yes. - Right here. - Yeah. - I'm gonna get back and get the 5d and come back and get a video of you. - Okay. - Don't like wander off and start taking photos.

Otherwise we would have woke you up to come. - Yeah. - [Hannah] What? - Yeah. - [Hannah] So while I was taking care of Kane throwing up in the bathroom, you were watching the sun rise? - [Conner] You know, we didn't really just want to like crowd around you while he was-- - Yeah we asked you if you need, we thought it was fine. - No, dude, that's fine, that's fine.

That was the Polaroid camera. - She fucking pissed me off last night. - I know, she pissed me off too. - And you hadn't put her in her place or said anything about it. - But Kane, she's emotionally irrational. I don't know what to say. This is fantastic, this is amazing. - Really annoying because it gets me like it's this burning feeling in here and it feels like I've just swallowed hot water. - Kane, go and see a therapist. - I'm sitting there like this. - I am not your therapist. - And it's like I just wanna - I am not your therapist! - Fucking lash out at them. - Go talk to someone else, this is my-- - I wanna like grab her head while she's driving and just bang it against the back of the seat and the window. - Stop it. - And then I get arrested because that's like female abuse.

What is wrong with you? - What, why do you have your ankle bandaged up? - Because it's cold. - What happened? - I tripped over the fucking bathroom. It's not a problem, leave me alone. - What? - Would you, fuck, why do you always do this? - We need to go to the doctor. - No we don't need to go to the doctor. - Yes we do.

He was stoned and he fell in the shower. Oh, I don't think it's funny. I just, I'm sorry. I just feel really uncomfortable right now. - [Hannah] This is my life. - It's my life too, okay? - No, Katherine, this is my life. You are in my life. You're in my house, you're in my relationship, and now Conner's been in you, right? That's what's happened. This is my holiday with my brother. You and Kane came along and you've been making it about you the entire time and now he is not going to the San Francisco Ballet company. - Pipe the fuck down for a sec. You brought me here for San Francisco Ballet. It's your dream, not mine. You want me here. I'm good where I am. I have friends, I have a life. I have a job, I get paid. I work my fucking ass off. I do everything to keep myself afloat. And what are you here doing, dicking around making fucking movies. - Hey. - Huh? And then I'm the irresponsible one when I need somebody that I wanna maybe try something with? - Conner, can you put your stuff aside for a second, understand that I miss you and I want you to be around and I need you. I need you here. - [Conner] You need me but I don't need you. - Why not? I'm really struggling. I'm really really struggling. I'm not okay. And I wanted you to be here. I want to know that you're safe. You're traveling around the world, you're going to all these countries with bombings in Paris last month. Like I need to know that you're safe because I can't lose anybody else, I can't. And for one weekend we two can be together now everything's fucked! - [Conner] Well maybe that's a good thing. Maybe I shouldn't move to San Francisco. - Great, well. This doesn't matter anymore. This doesn't matter. And he certainly doesn't fucking matter, so. - What, what are you gonna do, huh?
