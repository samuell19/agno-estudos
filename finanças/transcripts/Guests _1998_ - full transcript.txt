GUESTS Do you know when the next train is? - 6.20, 6.30 at the latest. - Thanks. Been waiting long? A while, fifteen minutes... You got a boyfriend? Yeah, so has she. Why? Just asking. Two girls like you... Don't mind a question, do you? I wasn't trying anything. Okay. Okay what? Nothing... We've been waiting half an hour. We're in a hurry, we have to go to work. Could we go into Rome together? Come with us. We're late. Good morning. Very late. You can't put these on the tablecloth. I know, I asked for a plate. They stain, fruit doesn't wash out. I got some more fruit. Use this. This is ready. Use the same color plates or we'll have to change them later. You picked a busy time. I wanted to suggest holding an exhibition here. I made some enlargements, 100 by 150 cm. They'd look good here, there's plenty of room. And lots of my friends always come to my exhibitions. When can I bring them? We'll hold it after the summer. I want you to see them first. Come when you like. Listen, you know everybody here... These boys who work for me they're living with an uncle in one small room. Do you know anybody who can rent them a place? Dirt cheap? - I can ask around. - There's two of them. For a short time even, somewhere near here. I have a small room I store stuff in. If I clear it out, they could have it. Not for long though, I'm going away. Just a few days, so they can get organized. Four or five days, okay? I won't charge them anything. Not done yet? Giacomo needs some plates, they're busy. Look how many there are. Do a few of them fast. You don't say. Don't just stand there. Look what a mess you made here. I'll give you a hand. You want to wash them? Go ahead! No, I said we'd do them together. I quit, sucker. Okay, suit yourself. Come back here! Gherti! Come on, let's have a smile. Smile like somebody's taking your picture. You are! I'll take one with the Polaroid. Both of us together? Yes, I want to see how the light is. I can't see a thing. Hold it... You look like Nureyev. It's ready. You can have it right now. - There's nothing on it. - Wait for it. - What is this? - He cut your head off. Is this an X-ray? You can see my skeleton. Is that an X-ray Polaroid? I don't know what happened. - Abstract art... it's good. - Looks like there's four of us. I guess you have split personalities! It's really good. - Yes, I'll blow it up. - You're an artist! I never took a picture like that. You've got a good camera, I use the disposable ones. It's nothing to do with the camera. You mean it's something you did yourself? No, that was the camera. I meant in general. - The camera does that? - I don't know why it's blurred. I guess you moved. Your hand's shaking. You're nervous, look what you did! Hello, I'm the boys' uncle. They told me to come here for the accommodation. Oh, the room. To stay for a couple of days. I'm just finishing something. If you'd like to wait here a minute... Or do you want to come in? I'm sweating. They went in there. Who are they? This is the room you can have. The bathroom's there. It's a bit cluttered, I'll clear it out later. Wait here five minutes, I'll be right back. Looks good for two people. It's not bad. There's a bed, a bathroom... What do you think? - I'm going, I don't like it. - How about you? It's nice, the bed's big enough for two. - Gherti's right. - I'm staying. Good, you have to stay too. It's perfect for two people. There's nothing wrong with it. Okay? Don't worry! It's all police movies now, social interest... action films. There's a good chance they'll take you. If you say so. When you have the photos you can take them to dozens of places. They look at them and give them back. You can use them alot. I wonder what this guy's after? Why has he taken usin? What do you think? Search me. What do you think? - About what? Staying here? - Dowe stay ordowe go? I think we stay. What could be better than this? I'm staying. You suit yourself. Go or stay. I'm staying. Where else canl go? We have a bed, we can share it. Here's sheets and pillows. Put them on the bed. Make the bed up. You can share it, it's big enough. Where do we put these? Just drop them in the corner. I saw a guitar. Can I play it sometime? I play with my uncle in Albania. Sure, you can play some Albanian songs for me. Everything's okay then. I'm going to take a shower. What's your name? Corrado. I'm Gherti and this is Ghini. Where did you meet them? Where I'm going to hold the exhibition. Where's that? It's a snack- bar and music club. Pass me a teaspoon? They're nice, but they can't stay here forever. I'm not the Caritas. Maria! Come on! Hurry up! You live near Corrado's place? - Yes, how do you know? - I've seen you there. - What's wrong? - How do you know? I live there too, I've seen you around. I was calling my wife. I'm sorry. I've seen her too. Why won't she come? What's she doing there? - She's not well. - Call her. - She's scared of the cars. - Call her. Maria, come on! How come you have so much free time? Don't you work? No, I haven't got a job. What have you done? I worked in a restaurant, but I quit. What would you like to do? I don't know, I'll have to look for a job I like. How old are you? You look young. I'm 20. At your age I used to ride horses. The races we had, me and my friends! Do you work now? I've lost my job too. I don't want to go back to my village. With my wife in this condition... It would be a problem for my relatives. You don't have to think about working now. You're not young. I like working, I've done it all my life. Since I was a boy, work is everything fo me. You always have to do what you like in life. What time's the bus? It won't be long. I've been waiting a while. Does it go to Parioli? Yes, it should. Murderer! Cuckold! Would you believe it? She calls me names and I've never hurt a fly. She calls me names... What a woman! - Do you know her? - Yes, she's my wife. What are you staring at? Did you hear what I said? Turn it down. I already did, what more do you want? Turn it down, I'm tired. It's midnight. Where have you been to get so tired? What the hell is it to you? You checking up on me? No, if I checked up on you, I wouldn't ask where you were. Turn it down, I'm tired. Turn it down. You watch too, the movie's starting. Why should I watch? You have your life, I have mine. If you won't turn it down... Cut it out. I can't heart! What have I done to you? - You're a kid. - Yeah, like you! Turn it down, you asshole! - Don't you understand words? - Who's an asshole? Turn it down because we're cousins. Are you a human being or an animal? What's that supposed to mean, we're cousins? - We're related. - So what? If we weren't, I know what I'd do to you. Turn it down! - No! - Turn it down! Not that too? Leave me alone, pal! Be thankful we're cousins and you're my uncle's son. I respect your father, my mother's brother, or I know what I'd do fo you! Some respect, the way you treated me the other time! I know what I'd do to you! - You'd do what? - I know. - Goon! - You were like this as a kid. Yeah, just like this. - You always were an asshole! - Sure, like you! Just like you! At least you've learned two words - "like you™! The only word you can say is "asshole™! I'll never be a jerk like you! You just work and sleep. And you smell like a dog! What else should I do? Isn't that why I came here? I'm not like you, loafing all the time. Enjoy yourself, pal! Why? I didn't come here to enjoy myself. - Okay, jerk. - Don't call me a jerk. - Wash yourself, you smell! - You first! We're all well, as you can see. Mom's well, Agnese is well. Times are hard because of the war and all the killing. Agnese is well too, I keep her under control. Say something to your brother, you're a big girl now. We're all well... and we hope you are foo. Very good. Send your sister a belt, she's too shy to ask. Give us a hand. - What kind of belt? - Nice and thin. - What else do you want? - Nothing else! If your brother doesn't help you, who will? We're tired of being out of work. I's chaos here, nobody knows what's going on. Thank God you're there. It's lucky you're in Italy. If you were here, it would be harder for me too. What else? Gherti! Hi, Lino. - Have you seen my wife? - No, why? Darn it I We were on the bus and I didn't see her get off. Maybe you could look around for her. Whereabouts were you? Down there, on the bus, I didnt notice her get off. In Piazza Euclide? I didn't notice. Let me know if you see her. - See this? - The bike? Great! - Isit new? Yours? - I just bought it. It's a beauty, it must have cost a barrel. Shock-absorbers too... Very professional. - 300,000 lire. - Not much. It was a bargain. There's a beautiful place in Rome to go cycling. We'll go sometime, me on blades, you on wheels. You can bike or skate there. It's a long cycle track that goes right out of Rome through the countryside and the sheep. I's great! You know the way? I'll fake you. No, I'll take you. I have to go, see you later. Mr. Pedri, good morning! May I have a word? The other tenants are asking about those two boys. - Are they legal immigrants? - They're good kids. Friends of mine, they're staying with me for a few days. If anybody asks, say they're friends of mine and they're staying five or six days at most. - Hello, Vincenzo. - Good afternoon, Mr. Gandini. Hi, Corrado, everything okay? - You were talking about... - Yes, the two boys. It's not them so much, they're probably nice kids. They look all right, but maybe their friends, who knows? You'd better register them, it's no joke these days. They've tightened up on immigrants now. We've already had problems. You'd better get them legalized. We have enough trouble here in the building. Thank God we have a new doorman. I keep my eyes open, they behave themselves. They won't stay long. They're nice boys... but you could get into trouble. - The other tenants... - People complain... Let's go? Goodbye. Don't worry. I'll let you know if there's any problem. You broke your new bike already? No, I took it apart. I like dismantling and reassembling. Tinkering, putting it right... I want to be a mechanic. You like messing with engines? You know I'm getting a sail boat? How is it? Okay? I like it now. When are you getting the boat? Should be next week. You can come and get it with me, if you like, then you can learn about boats, it's great. - Something always needs fixing. - Taking things apart... Something always gets broken in a boat, unfortunately. I'm looking for my wife. She's wearing a scarf and a coat. What's she look like? She's not right in the head. We were on the bus, she got off the stop before ours and I don't know where she went. Maybe she's here. - Do you know which ward? - No, I'm looking for her. You haven't seen her? Have you tried that ward? She could be there. No, I just got here. Maybe she's there, she's done this two or three times before and I found her in the hospital because she's not well. Try in there. Ask the nurse down there. - You work here, don't you? - I'm just strolling. With all the nice places in Rome? Our streetcar's on this side. That one goes the other way. Nobody there has seen her, I asked the doctors too. What do we do, go home? It's no good, I've looked for her everywhere. Maybe you'll find her later. I'll find her, I'll look everywhere. I can't just leave her. - Does she love you? - Sure. - What if you don't find her? - I've got to find her at all costs. It's dangerous here, there are rocks. Don't dive in, clear? You can look, but don't dive. Don't go too far out! The sea's choppy. Don't worry. I'm leaving! I'm going to swim back to Albania! See how they stand? If you upset them, they go. Paola, I came here to see you. All right, I know, but I'm working. - I have to finish this. - Okay, finish it. Give me those, I'll hold them. I have to stick them on, you don't know how. I'll carry them, it's something fo do. Don't mess around, huh? Corrado! For Christ's sake! I'm working, I can't play games! If you make me screw up... You're always criticizing, telling me off. You're never happy, you go on and on. I waited for you till 11 last night. Once! It only happened once. I never know where you are, where you go. You can change plans every day, but I'm always here, it's different for me. If I say I'll be home at 8... - That's true. - Cut it out then. You're right. You're young, you're right. Have you had a lot of girls? You made it with them? Who knows? You worked more or you made it more? Alot... I worked a lot. You know what? I'll find you an Albanian woman. - Okay? - I like Italian women. If you find your wife... will you take her where they put crazy people? If I find her, I'll fry to help her get better. But it's a chronic problem with her head... Stop it! When did you come to Italy, Ghini? Two years ago. Cut it out! I'm soaked! So? It's hot. Let me have a drink. Cut it out! So you came here a couple of years ago? Do you like it? - You like Italy? - Yes, and you? Well, it's okay. I was born here, so it's no big deal, but for you it's a new country, everything you do is nice because it's a novelty. It's all so different. It's different in my head. When I came, I had no idea what Italy was like. I got on the boat and said, I'll go wherever it takes me. You came by boat? You had no idea what it was like? No, I'd been to Greece, overland though. I'd never crossed the sea. You came to a place where you didn't know anyone. Yes, it's new, but it's hard too. I guess you're bored at times. Lots of times. Dowego? I wanted to know if there's any work. I'm sorry, I'd like to help but there's four of us already. What are you going to do now? - Where are you offto? - I'm going home. - I have to go home. - How about tomorrow? We'll see... You know the song? What will be will be... How about you? I'm always short of time, even though I'm out of work. I do things, see friends... You hang around. Do you like that kind of life? You should do it too. I'd get bored living like that. It's only until I get another job. Work's easy to find if you really want to. Will you help me get a job? These days employers can tell by your face if you're a good worker. Do you look like a good worker? - Me?Dol? - Yesorno? I don't know, what do you think? I say you don't much. You're still a boy, I don't want fo preach. Your whole life's ahead of you, but it's time you thought about it, you're 20. Hello, Police? Yes, it's me again. I called a few hours ago about that woman who went missing on the bus. You'll call me? I lost her on the bus and I can't find her. Let me know something as soon as possible. I'll give you my number. Oh, you have it! Yes, I gave it to you. Thank you, goodbye. It's Paola. I was looking for you. I'm going to bed now, don't call me tomorrow, I won't be here. About the boat trip, we'd better call it off. I made my bed here tonight. That's okay, no problem. Just don't get it dirty. Everything okay? Well... Every time I finish work... when I try to make a few plans, some problem always comes up. How do you mean? I thought I'd work here for a couple of years, then go back and be a mechanic, I like that. Then somebody calls me from home and says they need money. That makes me depressed and I can't work. Where did you go? I went dancing at the Upside Down. I danced with a beautiful girl all night. You know, in a clinch... It was great. Then I went back to her place. Yes, her place. She was one of those... You know, all wild. As soon as you touch her, she takes off. It was great. Except I was so turned on I came right away. You know those erotic dreams... Ever had one of those dreams? You're with a girl and you're going to have sex, but you come just before you start screwing? It was just like that. Terrible! We laid there for a while, then we started again... We were just going to make it... but she has a really ugly dog. The Chinese kind, with a squashed face like they've smashed into a wall, they slobber too. Forget the dog. Anyway, while we're screwing, the dog arrives. It jumps on to the bed and starts licking my foot. Just when we were... It licked my foot. Very gently... - You have to watch out... - For dogs! Yeah, pets. It was just terrible! It knocked me cold. Right, I'm going to bed. Take care, huh? Cheer up! Get some sleep and I'll see you tomorrow. We'll go out in the boat, okay? Yeah, what the hell! The police called me from Sabaudia... It's on the sea. They say they found a woman's body. From their description it's not my wife, this body they found. This woman's wearing slacks, whereas my wife had a heavy coat on. But I'll go and see just to make sure. I don't know how to get there. What goes there? You can take the bus. Where from? I don't know how to get there. We're going to the sea, maybe we can take you. That's very kind of you. Where's the police station in Sabaudia? It must be 50 kilometers from here. I've got to get there, the police called me. They found a woman's body on the beach... You know my girlfriend takes care of cows? She's a vet at a place near Rome. They have 150 cows. A few bulls too, they always have bulls. To mount the cows? Sure. When bulls get mad they're mean. Once, when I was a boy... we were standing there, looking and suddenly a huge bull appeared. It wasn't funny. I started running and I saw this high wall. I said to myself, I've got to jump over that. Let's hope he stops. So I jumped over it fast, I was a boy then. I was kind of scared too. Not terrified... I didn't want to risk. When I got to the wall, the bull was right behind me. It was neck and neck, me climbing over and him arriving, with his tongue hanging out. - Are you a relative? - No, I'm a friend of his. I drove him here. He's the husband. - The boys? - They're friends of mine. Is it rue what the Sergeant said... that this woman's wearing slacks? We'll ask Mr. Pasculli. You'll have to identify the body. - Has she got a watch? - I dont know, we'll find out. - Go on, lino. - I can't face it. The trouble is, we don't have refrigeration here. - We'll do the identification... - Who's coming? Mr. Mura? What's the problem? I can't face it. - He says he cantdo it. - I heard. I've been like this since I was a boy. I can't look at dead bodies. It's a feeling of... Can he go? He knows his wife. I never go to funerals. Even if I go to the cemetery, I stop at the gate. I can't stand the sight of bodies. You must identify her. Someone else can do it, if he's not up to it. All right, Mr. Mura, who can identify her? - Corrado can go. - l can do it, so can he. He knows her. I'd rather not. - I'll go. - Whois he? A friend, he knows her well. We live in the same building, he knows her well. You live in the same building? You know her well? Who'll warrant for him? I'll warrant for the boy. He knows her well. An identification is a serious matter! He knows her personally. I see. What's your name? - What? - Gherti. He's not even Italian! - Pasculli, come here! - Don't get angry. If she's wearing slacks and a watch, it's not her. Wait here. Come with me. Trying to break your foot? Rule number one: no shoes on beard. Take your shoes off. Rule number one: no shoes on beard. Was it really... Salvatore's wife? How about a swim? When we're out, huh?
