THOMAS: You know, the one thing about the show that I found to be true over the years, you know, whether we're doing the show for 50 people ten years ago or whether we're doing the show now, which is that the way that you all listen to each other and engage with each other up there is the real magic trick. Everyone thinks it's the other stuff and the rhyming, but that's actually what it is.

He was one of my co‐conspirators in making things. THOMAS: I was this kid who used to play sports, and Anthony was someone who also played sports, who had this performing instinct. And Anthony was someone who, my junior year of college, really pulled me into the theater. ANTHONY: And in college, I did an improv show. And this was the first time that Tommy really became a part of the theater community at Wesleyan. Prior to that, he was very into American history, and he was, like, a sports dude. And he loved hip‐hop, so we were always, like, at every house party rapping together. ‐ I think it was that next year, '99, Anthony and I drove to go help a friend out with his senior film in Iowa, and it was supposed to be, like, a 10‐ or 12‐hour drive. We were gonna drive from Brooklyn. Then we ran into a hail storm. And the only way we could stay awake was to put on the B‐side of Daft Punk's "Around the World." ANTHONY: That beat is so pulsing that you can't take time to think. ‐ And Anthony and I freestyled for four straight hours. That, in some way, was a seed for Freestyle Love Supreme. [Daft Punk's "Around the World"] ♪ ♪ When we got to New York and started this little theater company and decided to work on In the Heights, Anthony would grab Lin at every break and just start freestyling. And I'd be sort of wrangling them back. I was like, "Okay, let's go. We gotta get back into the thing." And this is 2002, 2003, and they kept on doing it and they kept on doing it. And they had an idea to maybe make a show out of it. ‐ Some people decided that we seemed like we knew what we were doing, and so they gave us the keys to the Drama Book Shop. Allen Hubby, who was the owner of the Drama Book Shop at the time, said, "Hey, would you create theater here?" We were so young and dumb. We were like, "Of course. We know how to create theater." ‐ We spent a lot of time in that basement, and Anthony was kind of running the Arthur Seelen Theater. That was sort of the job. ‐ We just started making stuff in... a small room, much like this, that was painted black where nobody was paying attention to us. And that was our lab. We did know, though, that we could, like, paint walls and buy curtains and I did some electrical work down in the basement of the Drama Book Shop, which was totally illegal. BILL: It was, like, a disaster in the early days. It was, like, I played the saxophone during it, and, like, that was kind of a disaster. I didn't really know how to play the piano. I still don't really know how to play the piano, and so, like, I don't know. Just seemed like a bunch of friends who have been really lucky and really talented and really motivated. ‐ We have all had our little bumps and bruises along the way, but those things are not anything that would even threaten the course of the group. ‐ It's the joy of falling on your face, the power of being unres‐‐unfettered with your friends and with people you care about. ‐ None of us know what's happening, so it's‐‐we're experiencing it with the audience. It's a different kind of communion than you normally get in theater. ‐ I feel like if I'm creating a moment, I want to be able to pull from stuff I felt when I was 16, from when I was five, from when I was ten. You gotta be able to pull from all of it and stay in touch with all of it. Now, what I need from you all tonight is a verb, an action word. To cry, to scream, to laugh, to love. Give me verbs, as many as you can shout. ANTHONY: We were doing shows in New York, and this producer came and saw us. And he said, "This would be fantastic at the Fringe Festival." ‐ Yes.

"Oh, you wrote In the Heights? "It's great. Listen, I really think "the third number in your show should go first 'cause it really sets up the world." Barely met him, and he's already got ideas for how to do it, and so I was very taken aback the first time I met Tommy Kail. But then I realized that it's not coming from any kind of bad place.

I'd moved away, you know, I was living in San Francisco. ‐ You know, Anthony and I have, in some way, you know, the furthest reach back and then the most divergent path 'cause when he left, he was the person that I was with all the time and then I was with not at all. ANTHONY: I didn't have a regular interaction with him. And then something had kind of... just ceased to exist between us anymore. ‐ In a way, it's like the furthest I felt from Anthony. You know, I just‐‐I‐‐ it had been the most time I spent away from him. I'd really been spending so much time working this other thing with a couple people he's enormously close to also with Lin and Chris. And I just felt a lot of that distance. ANTHONY: So, I saw Hamilton at the Public. And I sent Tommy an email the next day, and I mentioned one or two thoughts that I had. ‐ He gave me his thoughts on my show the day before the show was freezing. It doesn't mean I don't value his opinion, but if I want his opinion, I'll just say, "Hey, can you tell me what you think about this?" That's not what I needed then. I needed him to say, "This is fantastic. I'm so proud of you guys." ANTHONY: Tommy and I had a pretty big falling out. We had a major difference around how we wanted each other to‐‐to be inside of a friendship. And we couldn't‐‐we couldn't find the common ground. ‐ And I remember talking to him after that and acknowledging that our relationship changed.

I needed to be equals to. And when‐‐you know, the way you identify a relationship is often how it can stay, and our relationship had evolved. Nothing would ever erase the things that are true about who he is to me, who he will be, who he was, what his impact was in the trajectory of my life. And my love for him has never diminished and would never diminish and I wanted to tell him that, but I also need to say, "But this is who I am now." ANTHONY: There's been a major change. Whether it's on his end or my end, I'm not sure, but my heart center is my family. And all the choices that I've made were to support them. LIN‐MANUEL: Are we in the Rose Garden right now? OBAMA: We are. Yeah, it must be a little nerve‐wracking. I hope I don't drop these cards. You ready? We're getting the cue? ‐ During that very heated 2015, 2016, when Hamilton went from the thing that everyone was whispering about to the thing that everyone was shouting about. BOTH: [vocalizing] ‐ But Hamilton is a unicorn, and it just‐‐just‐‐ there's no way to quantify or qualify the effect that it's still having. LIN‐MANUEL: I was sort of cocooned from it 'cause I'm still doing seven shows a week, and so I can't go out to the parties I'm being invited to. I got two shows tomorrow.
