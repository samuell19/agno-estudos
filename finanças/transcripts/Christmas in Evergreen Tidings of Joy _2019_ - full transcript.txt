(Katie) Excuse me, I can take it from here, if that's okay. (Male Narrator) Oh, ho ho ho. By all means. Be my guest. (Female Narrator) And so there's Evergreen, Vermont. The place that knows how to shake a snow globe, send a letter to Santa, and where Christmas trees are often delivered in a big red truck. My story started on the train. Come to think of it, that's where it ended, too. Let's not get ahead of ourselves. [shutter snaps] Oh. Hmm. [rumbling sound] Oh, wow, I am so sorry! You okay? Yes, I was just, uh, looking for a plug. Right. Okay. [laughs] Sit. Uh, well, good luck with that. This train's been running long before the... anyone needed to plug anything in. Well, that makes sense. Yeah, this train is like The Polar Express combined with the Hogwarts Express and ended up... The Evergreen Express. Yeah, we do a pretty good job of promoting Christmas cheer. We? Are you from Evergreen? Born and raised. [gasps] Wow. I've been reading a lot about it. It's getting a lot of press! Mmmhmm. Yes, yes, yes, look. "With its world-renowned Christmas festival, "Evergreen, Vermont has become a must-see destination "for anyone seeking the magic of the Christmas season." All true. Okay, so what, does this town just magically disappear after Christmas, and then magically reappear at the first snowfall? Like Brigadoon? Yes! No. They're the next town over, but they're our competition because we do fewer musical numbers than them. But our football team is better. [laughs] I'm Ben Baxter. Hi. Katie Connell. -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you. You too. [laughs] What brings you to Evergreen? Some time off, actually. I published a novel a few years ago, and since then I've been working as a freelance writer. I've been doing a lot of reading and I read about your town, thought I should come check it out. Are you also going to be writing about this place? No, you know, I plan on experiencing Evergreen. See, at some point, I have to work on my second novel, and I think it might be good for me to take a break. Clear my head. Change of scenery. Well, you're in luck, because scenery we do have.

Well, I guess, Merry Christmas. [crowd chants] Merry Christmas! Oh my goodness, wow. Welcome to Evergreen. [phone rings] Oh. Hey Mom. Katie, hi. You made it okay? I did. Smells like pine, there's light snow falling. Not going to lie, already feel pretty relaxed. How are you? Well, I wouldn't say it's been my best day. I need to find a writer to help fill the cover story for our next issue. Wait, I thought you had that sports reporter doing the story about inventing a new sport. I did. He broke both of his hands. Yikes. Okay, so you're?... I'm wondering if you wanted to throw your hat in. To write a cover story? But I just started a vacation. I know, but it possibly could lead to something bigger. We're going to be hiring some new staff in the new year, and this would help move you to the front of the line. But Mom, I really, really love freelancing, and I am so excited to write my second novel. I know, but you're really good at this. And it would be nice to get you something, you know, stable. Mom.

I told you I'd like to keep calling it the Turner Tinker Shop. That's really sweet of you, but it's an art Centre too. I mean, the Turner Tinker Shop used to be my parents store where people went to go get things repaired. And I still like fixing things, plus there's so much history in the name. You should stop by and see. I just set up a new area for crafts and a glass blowing studio. Plus the rumor around town is that the place has something to do with a secret Christmas time capsule.

I don't want to be late, and I hear there's pie. It's the Kringle Kitchen. Oh hey! Hi. How's it going? 24 hours in Evergreen and I'm already joining societies.

Uh, I'm not entirely sure just yet what I'm... -Sit here. -Thank you. Uh, writing about. But I'm taking a few notes. Thank you. I keep hearing about this time capsule. Oh ho, we haven't talked about that for a while. But maybe some fresh eyes can help us figure it out. And now we have two journalists for the price of one. Ben has a journalism degree. Wrote for a paper in Chicago before coming back here and work... Okay, okay. Okay, well. My parents used to run this diner when it was just a bakery, and they were best friends with... My parents, who of course ran the town tinker shop. Which is also the town art Centre. Yes. (Hannah) When we were kids, we'd always hear this talk about a Christmas time capsule. But then every time we'd ask our parents about it, they'd just kind of smile and say "oh, you know, one day." [laughing] And then a few years ago, we found this archive of newspapers and found this article. Yes. The Christmas blizzard. 50 years ago, a blizzard kept everyone in town for almost the entire month of December. If you read right there. Right. (David) "Some residents of Evergreen also passed the time "by making a surprise time capsule "to be opened in 50 years." Meaning this year. Mm-hmm. Yes, but the problem is, there hasn't been any other articles written. And our parents have passed. There's nobody really that remembers anything. Wow, nobody? Well, Nan said there might be another box to look through at the library. Keep at it, buddy. Is there anything else that you'd like to discuss? Yes, well let's start the meeting and talk about our plans for... Oh, that's Allie, that's our daughter. Michelle is driving her to the... [tears up] We can be brave about this. Probably. Allie!

[engine starts] I guess the truck says we're a go! [cheering] Joyeaux Noel! Merry Christmas! Ooh. It's freezing. Bye. So, did you learn everything you needed about Evergreen? If I'm being totally honest, feels a little too good to be true. Okay, which part? I'm just curious. Well first off, you have a guy who looks exactly like Santa on vacation. Yeah, Nick. He splits his time between Evergreen and... The North Pole? Burlington. He comes for December. Look, I... I get it. Even alleyways are decorated for Christmas. It makes sense, I'm for it. You have to put on a good show. Nah, it's... It's for the tourists. It's not that, it's... People love to get out of the city and enjoy a real Christmas. Wait, wait, wait. Are you saying that city Christmases aren't real? I mean, we're just not cynical here. Who says we are? [glass shatters] (Hannah) Ahhhh!!! Oh, no! I was just trying to make a wish. I'm partially to blame myself. I... I bumped into Hannah, and... No, no, I should've had a better grip on it. I'm so sorry, guys. Accidents happen. No. This globe has been an Evergreen tradition, and now? Now we'll just focus on getting it fixed. Yeah. Do you think Elliot might be able to do something about it? It's worth a shot. I should probably get back to the library and check on Nan. So you're masquerading as a mild-mannered librarian when underneath it all, you're actually a mild-mannered reporter? Yes, I used to be a journalist but it's not what I do now. Why not? What, too nosy? Yes. But it also means you're good at your job. I used to be a journalist and I was actually pretty good at it. Then I came back here to help out for a little bit and... And? The library is sort of like my family. After my parents died, Nan raised me. Oh, sorry. Just... follow-up questions. Hey, so if I wanted know about town history, who would I ask? That would be David. Oh! That kid's the eyes and ears of this place. I will keep that in mind. He's usually in the library though, so I'll probably see you around. [chuckles] So, what were you wishing for? Oh, I've had a complicated relationship with this globe. Mmm. It hasn't granted your wishes? I mean, sometimes I think I'm not being specific enough, sometimes I'm being too specific. Honestly, I don't know. Yeah. So, remember. A good Christmas ornament has colour. It evokes a feeling of nostalgia. And it's made with care. What are you making? Oh, this? It's a key ornament for my Aunt Hannah. I really want her to know how much fun I think she is. She definitely is that. Elliot! Oh, hi David. Hi. I was just leading a workshop on ornament making. You can join if... Woah! Yeah. Oh no.

You know, my Mom works for a business magazine, but honestly, I would rather write about the Christmas time capsule. Don't give up hope on being able to. That time capsule was intended to be a surprise, and this town... I thought nobody remembered anything about the Christmas time capsule. [nervously] Well... I guess... Ho, ho, ho!

Everybody worked here in high school. Wow. My jobs in high school involved a lot more filing. Ah. I'm sure yours was more fun. That's right. (Katie) That smells amazing. Terpenes. Well, each year, someone asks me why Christmas trees smell so nice. So I went to the library, and guess what? Terpenes. The... the tree gives off this scent to protect themselves from bugs and some people believe that the scent floats up and seeds the clouds. It brings snowfall. Wait, is that true? Well, leave the science to the scientists. But all of it working together in a circle like that, just imagine. It's amazing. Christmas trees. Who knew? Henry knew. Ah. Ben, would you mind?

All these years looking at the sleigh in the snow globe, I always wondered if it was based on this one. You should see if there's a key under it, like the one in the snow globe. What key? I can look.

Welcome to story hour. Please have a seat. Hi, hi. Hi Ben. Get settled in and I promise to do my most hilarious voices. Ben, I... I should um, I should get in there.

Well, good morning everyone, and thank you for coming out to see what is in our second box. She's doing an excellent job of mayoring. Don't you think? Like she was born for it. Now I know it's going to be hard to choose who's going to open these boxes every day, but I have a plan for that. Voting system. That's what I'd do. Nan has been so kind to lend us this beautiful snowman's hat. It is from the original Evergreen hat factory. So if you're interested in participating, write your name down on a piece of paper and drop it in the hat. So, each day, I will draw a different name from it. But I think we can all agree that for the second box, it should be opened by the two people who kept the secret the longest, Nick and Nan. [applause] Ah! Number 2. There you go. Yes, thank you. Oh, I remember this. We know there won't be enough for everyone, but may you all enjoy the skating. Inside this box are some Evergreen scarves to keep you all warm. Love Mike and Masha Stahl.

Or... or that I would own my own store, or better yet, that I'd be hanging out with these two little dogs that I am probably most definitely keeping, -Do not tell anybody that. -Oh, yeah. All I'm saying is it's just been one big surprise after the next. And that doesn't get exhausting? Surprises? Yeah. No, no. Surprises are great. I mean, think about it. That's why we wrap gifts, right? We don't just hand them to people. Surprises are, you know, they're exciting. I don't know, I think they add a little bit of magic. Oh!
