AND ME, I HAVE BEEN HERE AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER. IT'S GOOD BUILDING. NO PROBLEM, NO MICE, NO RATS, NO FUSS. OH, THAT'S WEIRD. WHAT? I JUST COULD'VE SWORN I SAW SOMETHING IN THE CORNER. GOOD WATER PRESSURE. WHEN THEY BUILT THIS, THEY KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING, NOT JUST LIKE NOW. YOU NEXT OF KIN? YEAH, I WAS HER GRANDSON. CAN YOU IDENTIFY THE DECEASED? YEAH, IT'S MY GRANDMOTHER... LILY WAINWRIGHT. WELL, YOUR GRANDMOTHER DIED OF A MASSIVE CARDIAC INFARCTION... HEART ATTACK. I'M OKAY CERTIFYING THAT SHE DIED OF NATURAL CAUSES. OKAY? YEAH. JOE WILL HELP YOU. OH, DANIEL, LOOK AT THIS PLACE. LIVING ROOM, DINING ROOM, THREE BEDROOM, THREE BATHROOM. YOU GOT MAID ROOM, EAT-IN KITCHEN, LAUNDRY ROOM... BIG PLACE. 3,500 SQUARE FEET. COME SIT. YOU WILL NEED LAWYER. A LAWYER? WHY AM I GONNA NEED A LAWYER? WELL, THIS PLACE IS RENT-CONTROLLED. YOUR GRANDMOTHER PAID VERY LOW RENT. AND YOU, YOUR FAMILY, YOU'RE ENTITLED TO THE PLACE, BUT YOU WILL NEED HELP OF LAWYER. BUT I NEVER LIVED HERE. I MEAN, DON'T I NEED TO HAVE LIVED WITH A RELATIVE BEFORE THEY DIED IN ORDER... DANNY, DANNY, DANNY... WHY YOU DO THIS? WHY YOU MAKE TROUBLE FOR YOURSELF? YOU LIVE HERE WITH YOUR GRANDMOTHER. BUT WHY WOULD THE LANDLORD TAKE MY WORD FOR THAT? HE WOULD TAKE MY WORD FOR IT.

IN YOUR CASE, YOU HAVE A DIRECT FAMILY MEMBER WHO PASSED ON. I'M SO SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS. YOU MOVED IN WITH HER BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO BE WITH HER DURING THE FINAL STAGES OF HER ILLNESS, WHICH ENTITLES YOU TO TAKE OVER THE LEASE UNDER THE SAME TERMS THAT SHE ENJOYED. LOOK, SHE DIED UNEXPECTEDLY OF A HEART ATTACK. NO, YOU MOVED IN WITH HER BECAUSE SHE COULDN'T COPE FOR HERSELF... AND THEN SHE HAD THE HEART ATTACK. I NEVER LIVED WITH HER. OKAY, ALL RIGHT, LISTEN, YOU MOVE INTO THE APARTMENT TONIGHT, ALL RIGHT? YOU CHANGE ALL THE LOCKS FIRST THING IN THE MORNING. DOUBLE... TRIPLE LOCKS. HE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. OH, UH... TRIPLE LOCKS? WHY? THE LANDLORD PROBABLY HAS COPIES OF THE EXISTING KEYS. BUT IF I TAKE OVER THE TENANCY, LEGITIMATELY, WHAT COULD THE LANDLORD DO TO ME? DANNY, YOU'VE ENTERED THE WORLD OF LANDLORD AND TENANT. THE LANDLORD IS THE MONSTER, THE GREAT BEELZEBUB, YOUR WORST NIGHTMARE. HE WILL DO ANYTHING TO KEEP YOU FROM TAKING OVER A RENT-CONTROLLED LEASE. NOW, ON THE OPEN MARKET, YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S APARTMENT WOULD FETCH $10,000 A MONTH, EASY. HE'S GONNA LET YOU HAVE IT FOR A LOUSY $675? YEAH, BUT I DON'T WANT TO LIVE UNDER THAT KIND OF STRESS EVERY DAY. NO ONE'S EVEN ASKING YOU TO. I MEAN, FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF WEEKS, YEAH, YOU GOTTA BE ON YOUR GUARD. BUT THAT'S AS LONG AS IT'LL TAKE ME TO GET A COURT ORDER. NO, TODAY'S MONDAY. AH, THANK YOU. UH, LET'S SEE, I COULD GET ONE FOR A WEEK FROM FRIDAY. THAT'S 12 DAYS. A COURT ORDER? A COURT ORDER OF PROTECTION, GRANTING YOU A NEW LEASE UNDER THE SAME TERMS AS YOUR GRANDMOTHER'S. HOW MUCH WOULD THIS COURT ORDER COST? IT'S 750, YOU KNOW. WELL, I KNOW YOU'RE GRIEVING, SO 500. 500? HALF NOW, HALF WHEN WE GET THE COURT ORDER. NOW REMEMBER, DON'T LEAVE THE APARTMENT UNTIL THE COURT ORDER COMES THROUGH. THIS IS ALL YOUR STUFF? I LIVE AN UNCOMPLICATED LIFE. I GOT GUY COMING IN THE MORNING TO CHANGE LOCKS LIKE LAWYER SAID. YOU ALWAYS DO WHAT LAWYER SAY. MANAGING AGENT COME BY TODAY. I TOLD HIM YOU LIVE WITH YOUR GRANDMOTHER FOR ONE MONTH. HE WAS COOL WITH THAT? WHY WOULD HE NOT BE COOL WITH THAT? ( glass breaks ) ( muffled yell ) DON'T WORRY ABOUT 1004. GOOD PEOPLE, NO PROBLEM. THANKS. YOU NEED ANYTHING, YOU CALL JOE.

AND THAT'S MY GRANDMOTHER, BUT I NEVER GOT TO KNOW HER. HOW COME? SHE SPLIT WITH MY GRANDFATHER WHEN MY MOM WAS IN 6th GRADE, AND HE TOOK MY MOM TO NEBRASKA, WHERE HIS FAMILY'S FROM. OH.
