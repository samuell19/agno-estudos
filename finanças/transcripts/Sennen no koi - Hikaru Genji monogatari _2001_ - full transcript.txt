Kyoto, Japan Life is but a dream... The world transient... Everything unreal. We are sinners now. You want me to die? It's terrible! Don't write the story. Why not? Genji's committing adultery. Yes. With the Empress. You'll be killed. Your story will destroy yourself, Father and me. Why did I start writing a story that terrified my brother? I'll explain. Well... I was born as the daughter of a scholar named Fujiwara Tametoki. You look happy. It's just ignorance. Echizen is uncivilized. You can't read books. Really? You can read books. My father was suddenly assigned as governor of Echizen Province. As his children, we accompanied him. My mother died long ago. A Chinese ship wrecked. Many books drifted ashore. The books interest you? Bookworm! Echizen is the home of beautiful paper. How charming! I got married to Nobutaka, one of the Fujiwara aristocrats. I wrote stories and sent them to Kyoto. He took an interest in me. He offered to take care of me. My father was glad, for I was past marrying age. Besides, he worked under Nobutaka. Will she accept his love? Or refuse it? Are you glad to see your father? Nobutaka was a courtier. I returned to Kyoto with him and lived near his mansion. He already had a main wife. He returned to her at night. It was customary for an aristocrat to keep several mistresses. My servant? Here, master. I'll see you again. I say... Yes? I'm pregnant. What?! I'm with child now. Oh, really? That's nice. I hope it's a boy. You still go back? It was a girl. Nobutaka named her Kataiko, but stopped coming to see me. So I went back to my father in Echizen. I'll take you home. Understand? Your mother isn't entertaining as a woman, but she is bright. I'm getting a promotion at court. Understand? I'll be a very important official. Then... I'll send you to serve the Emperor. If he makes love to you and fortunately you have a boy, your son will be the next emperor. I'll reign supreme as the Emperor's grandfather. Kataiko? Lovely child! You're pretty. But... To captivate the Emperor you must make poems and tell him enchanting stories. Your mother has such talent. So I came for you. Kataiko! Run! Kataiko! Where's Nobutaka? Nobutaka? Nobutaka? Nobutaka? Where is Nobutaka? I don't know. Are you safe? Your father? My dear! Don't touch him. He's dead. My dear! Don't Report it to his main wife in Kyoto. But he's bleeding. Only his main wife can hold his funeral. So don't touch him. I understand. GENJI - A THOUSAND YEAR LOVE Five years later... I was suddenly invited by Regent Fujiwara Michinaga. I returned to Kyoto. Look! She's Lady Murasaki. Her father is a mere local official. Lady Murasaki. Welcome to my house. Come in. I'm Michinaga. As you wished, my lord, I, Murasaki Shikibu, have now presented myself. No court manners. Come closer. Do as he says. Why the stare? Do I look strange? You look like my late husband. I'm surprised. You mean Nobutaka? He was my cousin. That's why. He died when he was promoted. That must have galled him. Excuse yourselves. This is Shoshi, my daughter. Please educate her. She'll marry the Emperor someday. Refine her so he'll be enchanted by her. Understand? The task is too much for me. You're a genius writer. I read the story you're writing. It's interesting. I didn't know you read it. What's the title? Tale of Echizen? No. "Tale of GENJI," That's right. That's what my cousin saw in you. I admire him. My brother lives south of Kyoto. You know that? Fujiwara Michitaka. He has a daughter named Teishi. He expects the Emperor to marry her in the future. Outrun her! Her tutor, Sei Shonagon, is another good writer. She's educating her. Sei Shonagon. Outrun her! In spring, it is the dawn. As the light creeps over the hills, wisps of pale purple clouds waver over them. In spring... the most beautiful thing is the dawn just before the sun rises. In summer... Isn't the most beautiful thing only one? The Emperor has many ladies to make love to. If you want him to stay with you, enchant him with your brilliance. At moonrise, the Emperor visits his harem. His women are waiting for him to knock at their doors. They use tactics. Like what? He hates boring women. Boring? Like the kind who always yawn? The kind who make the Emperor yawn. They can't carry out their task. What task? To invite the Emperor to your chamber every night and have his child as soon as possible. That's your task. Lady Murasaki is here. I have a book. It will help you grow into a wonderful young lady. Beautiful! What do you think the ideal man is like, Shoshi? Ideal man? What is he like? The ideal man all women dream of is like this prince... Hikaru GENJI. As his name hints, his radiant countenance is attractive. Hikaru! Prince GENJI! Hikaru GENJI was born a prince. The Emperor's son. A prince! His father was Emperor Kiritsubo, but his mother had no family backing. The women in the palace were mean to her. She died young. A motherless child has no power. When his brother became Emperor, he left the Imperial Household. He became one of the subjects. Life is but a dream... The world transient... And everything unreal. He's good at everything. As he passes by, his fragrance intoxicates nearby ladies. Is there a man like that? Of course. This is a true story. Shoshi. I'll describe the dream man for you in brief. Hikaru Genji's mother, Lady Kiritsubo, was beautiful. After she died, the Emperor married a lady who looked like her. That was Empress Fujitsubo. Hikaru, meet your new mother. Please! Your gaze will make me vanish. You're beautiful. Hikaru saw the image of his mother on Fujitsubo. After he grew up, he was separated from her. The farther they were apart, the stronger his love grew. He was helplessly infatuated with her. He waited for her return from the harem. I can't stop... No! You can't... You must know how I feel. How dare you do this to me! You're crying. Please shed your tears for someone else. You mean you don't love me? Was your affection false? I can't tell you. I can't. Close your eyes. No! It's our destiny. It's written. Now we're both sinners. I became one long ago. Each time I saw you, I sinned in my mind. So did I. Whenever I saw you, I sought a chance to kiss you. I thought of nothing else. After a long while, you laughed. Sinners often laugh. I vowed to moon: Should I fail to have you tonight, I would die. I'm so happy I can die now. When can I see you again? This is the last time. No! Never again. Even if in-laws, they were mother and son. Men are brought to life by their mothers. Mothers are their home. That's why men want to go home. They always travel homeward. Home... Empress! It hurts! I'm haunted! Evil spirits? I deserve torture. Because I sinned. Empress... It can be... It can be... What?! Congratulations! Is his stepmother pregnant with his child? Possibly. She got pregnant while she was at home. Terrible! But no one can tell when a woman really gets pregnant. It could be Hikaru's child, if she says so. Likewise, it could be the Emperor's child. It's a boy. He looks like you. Look. Well done. Guess what incense. I can beat you. What's this incense? I don't know who's wearing it. It's new to me. It's her smell! What's wrong? He made love to his stepmother only once. But it fanned his desire and drove him mad. The thought that he got her pregnant tortured him. I was prettier when young. His love for his mother turned him to older man. He wooed Lady Rokujo who was eight years older. I wish I'd have met you earlier. She was heavy. Forgive the lady's not seeing you off. You're beautiful. Your name? Chujo. Chujo? Maybe I look capricious, but you're exceptional. You'll be welcome next time. I don't understand how men feel. They want all that's beautiful. Hikaru GENJI should have a wife. He's already married. He has a wife? At age twelve, he married a princess from a noble family. GENJI, take care of Aoi, my sister To-no-Chujo was Genji's best friend. His father and grandfather were ministers. My sister. Prince GENJI. How do you do. Lady Aoi was reared to marry the Emperor in the future. She was beautiful and of high social rank. But like a Korean vase, she lacked sentiment, despite her elegant appearance. Please wait, master! Lady Aoi is... Why not come to see your husband? My dear, I'm with a child now. Really? I only touched you softly. But you got pregnant. It's rather strange. I agree. No, it's not. Forgive me. Like a fairytale, it flew from the sky and got into my belly. That's right. It's an angel. No, not an angel. No? Your child by another woman got into me. My child? By whom? Lady Rokujo's jealousy is deep and strong. It could torture Genji's wife to death. To death? Remember. Fear women's jealousy. No other women shall have him! Help her! Pray! Chant! She's pregnant with my child. Save her life! My dear! Move! Aoi! Pull yourself together! What do you want? What is it? Take the child from me. Take it out. The voice... not Aoi's. It's me. No! That woman! I want to be a priest. I want to serve Buddha. Wait! No! Ageha! I'm not your plaything! Kyoto streets are filled with the spirits of desperate women. Every night... I'm asking you. To cast a spell on me. Spirits and phantoms! Take me away Where we can be free. Let me see you. Teishi got the Emperor's summons ahead of Shoshi to be his consort. Why the delay? Shoshi is only twelve. She's old enough. Send her to the palace so she can be the Emperor's wife. Don't walk behind Teishi! Don't be hasty. Be ready! Shoshi hadn't grown enough as a woman. Teach her how to accept a man's love? I felt sorry for the innocent girl. Tell me more about GENJI. One day GENJI saw a girl who looked like Empress Fujitsubo whom he loved. Wanting to become a monk, GENJI went to a village, north of Kyoto. Playing with a sparrow? A lovely child! Come. Come. Come. She was playing here. Murasakinoue! My daughter's gone! Find her! Who took her away? Murasakinoue! How lovely! GENJI took the girl to his mansion to rear her. He spent days and nights together with her. He wanted her to be his wife in the future. It was a great fortune for her. GENJI must have thought so. But... Most men of high court positions think so. Don't be afraid. Leave everything to me. Imagine you're on a cloud. I'm the wind. The summer breeze. GENJI had intended to make an ideal woman of Murasakinoue. What type of woman is that? Men like woman who suit their needs. Suit their needs? But only when a man and woman suit one another can they have a child. Can what suits a man and what suits a woman ever agree? They say you made love to that lady. Is it true? She's gazing at you. The little prince might be your... The Emperor knows it. Maybe he's testing you, with the three gathered here. What's wrong? The carriage... That woman! She never gives up. As a means to end her love for GENJI, Lady Rokujo went far away. Free from Lady Rokujo's jealousy, GENJI enjoyed love. Love for a night like this flower. He picked up girls anywhere. His thirst for love had no end. GENJI... Unless you take me, you can't say you enjoyed making love. Shall I call you Old Lady? Young girls know nothing. I'm fully matured. The mellow ripeness. Let me show you. Are you awake? Oh, it's daybreak! See me only in the dark. I'm a flower to pick last. Recognize me by this scent. Please go home. I won't see you again. Remember you had such a woman too. Utsusemi... He was born to hunt women. But a terrible fate awaited him. Terrible fate? He sowed his seed. It was once Takamagahara. It was once Asuka. It is now this Kyoto. I am an Emperor now. I am Emperor Jujo. Emperor Kiritsubo, Genji's father, gave the throne to his eldest son. The new Emperor, Jujo, was Genji's half-brother. Congratulations! I'm not healthy. I should name my successor. I hope you will have a wife and children soon. I pray for it. I won't be able to have a child. You mustn't give up. This is Prince Kazuki. My youngest brother. Please have your own child. Your own child! Is the prince really my child? I must ask the Empress and make sure of it. Where's the Empress? Fujitsubo! Who are you? Oborozukiyo, a lady-in-waiting. Lady Oborozukiyo! Beautiful, like your name! Come over here. Empress Fujitsubo is over there. I was looking for you. I have a favor to ask you. A favor? Will you accept my love? How passionate! You looked very beautiful beside the Emperor. You want to see Empress Fujitsubo, don't you? No! I sneaked in the palace looking for you. I want the moon to be hazier. Can it happen? Lady Oborozukiyo was the Emperor's love. Yes. I'm afraid of men. Don't be afraid, Shoshi. Women are stronger than men. Are they? Because women bear children. No babies come from men's bodies. But men use their brain. What if Oborozukiyo bears a son? He thinks it's his child to make as crown prince. I don't understand. Maybe be preferred betraying his brother to betraying his father. It's light. I hope this room will be filled with fans. Yes. I'll be back. Calm down, Minister. Why so upset? Dowager. Please listen! It's about my niece. I went to Oborozukiyo's chamber this morning. Oborozukiyo? The lady the Emperor loves? I rushed in, to find out if the rumor is true. Uncle... Minister. I hear you had a fever, so I came. Still feverish? That sash is for a man. Let me see it. I'll examine it. That's mine. So it's you! You're the Emperor's mother. The Emperor loves Oborozukiyo. But GENJI molested her. It's unforgivable! That's right. I'll never forgive him. I'll expel GENJI from the capital. A memorial service for the last Emperor. A nun?! She'll become a nun. Is it the Dowager's idea? She wants to weaken my power! When a woman cuts her hair, She bids goodbye to her life, The life of a woman. Murasakinoue! Murasakinoue! Help! It was a dream. What a relief! What's the matter? The little girl has grown into a beautiful lady. Her breasts standing, her skin glowing like silk... She coos like a dove in Genji's embrace. Above all, she has grown into the type of woman GENJI likes. Murasakinoue. Listen carefully. I'm leaving town. Leaving town? Maybe you don't understand. The Emperor's mother hates me. Dowager Empress? She thinks she can make fools of the Emperor and me! As I recall, his late mother thought little of me. The courtiers plan to exile me. Exile? To avoid it, I'll leave town before they can. I understand. Shall I go with you? I'll go alone. That's how to avoid reproach. No matter how desolate the place, I'll go with you. Please don't leave me. Try to understand. Please. Father... I'm going to leave town. When will we return to see the town lights? Farewell. You promised you wouldn't leave me alone. I'll be waiting for your return. What can I do? Are you all right? Nail shut the doors! There! Koremitsu! It's Heaven's wrath! Off with GENJI! He betrayed his father and brother! He did me wrong! Is he all right by the sea? Good news! Go to the palace! Congratulations! You're summoned by the Emperor. Teishi is the Emperor's favorite. In summer, nights. Especially the moonrise. Even in dark nights, many fireflies flick about. Very good, very good. And in autumn? Attract him to Shoshi's chamber. Outrun Teishi! All night long I cry and cry outside your door. Louder than the rapping of the moorhen. It's him. This is unusual. The moorhen rapped as if it were an urgent matter. But had I opened the door, I would have regretted it come morning. There he is! Over there! It's hardly believable. I heard in my dream. Heard what? A great storm is coming. Set sail. After the storm passes, go to the shore of Suma. A noble person will be waiting. Shall we follow him? He's the richest man around here. And... he has a beautiful daughter. You saw her? No chance to. I only heard the rumor. Now, get aboard. Beautiful! Thank you. Do you like her? What a beauty! Your daughter? That's right. I don't understand. Why so capricious? GENJI has an ideal woman for his wife. Why bother with another? I don't understand. How true! May I come in? Your Majesty! I heard your merry voices, so I came. We were talking about a story. So you're the one who wrote it. Tale of GENJI. It's interesting. Thank you. Tell me the story. It's hard to explain. Love and fascination look alike but are quite different. The story depicts it. Love and fascination look alike but are quite different. Interesting. As different as man and woman. As man and woman. Interesting. You know someone like that? My birth is so humble I cannot marry you. How sad! You will return to town sooner or later. I'll take you with me. Stay with me. GENJI! Prince Hikaru! Welcome! Kyoto is a dull town without you. Is my Murasakinoue fine? She heard it. Heard what? About Lady Akashi. Who told her? Dowager Empress. She sent someone to spy on you. Dowager Empress! She already let your wife know. So she wrote to me. There were strange incidents in the palace. Father! Father! Why the agony? Hikaru GENJI... He said Hikaru GENJI. Because you had him. No! No! You slept with my brother! Phantoms! What sign is this? His Majesty's eyes! You caused it! Emperor! Mother! Open your eyes! I can't see! It hurts! Someone is haunting him. Hikaru GENJI! From Kyoto! Return to Kyoto. Good! The Emperor's sick. He wants me back. Will you be the next emperor? Not so loud. I left the Imperial Household. The next emperor will be... Prince Kazuki, Empress Fujitsubo's son. That's right. And who will be his adviser? Only me. Is the prince your son? You shall never say that again! Look whom I have brought! Hikaru GENJI! I'll return to Kyoto. I'll build a house for you and your child. I'll take you there. Really? Yes. I'll take you there, that's for sure. I'm glad. That's good! Very good! Indeed! Indeed! But will Lady Murasakinoue agree? Hikaru GENJI returned to Kyoto. I'm back! I'm back! I'm back! I missed you. Forgive me. I won't leave you again. Really? If so, I shall be very happy. It's true. Come! Look! This town's beauty is unrivaled. I shall be a man indispensable to the town. Murasakinoue. This town will be ours. Why tremble? Aren't you happy? Can I have a child by you? GENJI. Yes, Your Majesty? Don't call me that. Call me Brother. Thank you. I have a request to make. I'm not well. I want to give the throne to my youngest brother. Bring him. When grown up, he looks like you. Silence! Succeed me to the throne. Call yourself Emperor Reiro. GENJI, support the young Emperor. Thank you. Indian envoy! I'm going to ascend to higher ranks. My daughter will become Empress in the future. It's a girl. Well done! Good for you! Send a messenger! To the capital! My new mansion has four pavilions named after the four seasons. Four seasons? What for? I'll gather flowers of each season. Flowers? You mean ladies? My flowers. You amaze me. You're making a harem of your own. In the Spring Pavilion over there will live my wife, Murasakinoue. Lady Hanachirusato! Lady Tamakazura! Lady Umetsubo! How would Lady Murasakinoue feel, with those mistresses around her? If I were her, I would hate it. In this world, you can't monopolize a man's love. Even if you want to, you shouldn't. Between a man and a woman, jealousy destroys oneself. So a woman must be patient. No one in this Winter Pavilion. No flowers in winter? I want Lady Akashi here. Lady Akashi? Try to understand. She bore me a girl. A girl? They say she's pretty. My daughter. Congratulations! Are you glad? When you're so happy, why should I be sad? Really? Good! May I bring her here? Yes. Will you rear her? Does Lady Murasakinoue comply with Genji's request? Must she do it? What would you do? I... I'd refuse. That's a problem. Lady Murasaki, what will she do? I don't know the answer yet. A lovely child! Good lady! Lady Murasakinoue might be barren. Poor woman! A barren woman might be pitiable. But to rear a child is a woman's task as great as to bear one. No, rearing is even greater than bearing. Rearing is greater than bearing. I wish I could send my milk to Kyoto. Why didn't you accompany him there? I fear Kyoto. I can't live with those beautiful, wise ladies. I think I educated you better than the ladies in town. I'm afraid. Remember. You threw your child into a pack of tigers. Tigers?! Yes. Your daughter will surely be killed. Why must I...? Good, good! I stayed too long. Your Majesty. She'd like to tell you bedside stories too. Well, I'll come to hear the Tale of GENJI at night. On a full moon night, Princess Kaguya is shining. She came from the moon, The pretty, innocent girl! But she will return someday. How sad will we be? She's pregnant! My daughter is pregnant... By the Emperor! Along this road... If I keep walking, Will I find you? I am alone. I want to see you. You are going ahead. Will there be light on your way? Or a flower garden? It's moving. You're right. Shoshi, you are beautiful. You have educated Shoshi so well. I'm most thankful. Now she's the Emperor's favorite. Congratulations! She needs more education. Instruct her and refine her. No more. I'll resign today. I'll write a sequel to the story. I love you. Stay by me! Don't! Why not? Look at the moon. I'm the full moon. I'm perfect. The moon waxes and wanes. I'm afraid of myself as I'm beginning to fall for him. How beautiful! Thank you for rearing her. Good news for you. The Emperor wants you. I'm glad to hear that. It's my honor. Invite Lady Akashi, her mother, to Kyoto. Let her see her daughter. What a woman! How nice! Stop it, Lady Tamakazura! You praised Lady Tamakazura's skin. So Ukon told you? You aren't jealous of her, are you? I'm not jealous. I'm trying to endure. To endure? Living in a mansion like this, you have nothing to endure. Welcome home. I understand well. About what? The love that men want. What's that? I don't want to say. Tell me! What is it? The love that men want? The Love that men want is... only caressing. Caressing? No! You're wrong! Wait, Murasakinoue! Murasakinoue! After that day... She never had peace of heart. The former Emperor asked me to marry Princess Sannomiya. I'm indebted to him. I couldn't refuse his request. She will be my main wife. Main wife? You're my real wife. That's certain. The princess is still very young. Will you educate her? Young Akashi has grown up. Next, Little Princess? I see no red carp. There are a few left. Did you eat the rest? Why should I eat them? I freed them. You freed them? You were proud of them. Why? I pitied them. Why? The water in the pond is fresh. Their food is good. Everybody praises them. Why pity them? I'm to blame. Tell me why! The women in the Pavilions of Four Seasons are... like the carp in the pond. Like the carp? They look beautiful, and eat good food, but they aren't as happy as those in the village ponds. So I let them go. GENJI. After Young Akashi marries the Emperor, let me leave this pavilion. You leave me? No, you can't. I want to be a nun. No, no, no! You're my ideal wife. How beautiful! I tried my best, for it's a present for the Emperor. Let's take it to the Emperor. You'll be a good wife. Women who resist are driven out. Women who resist drift away. Living in a beautiful town, Wearing colorful silk garments, Making poems under cherry trees, Smiling, smiling... Women suffer and feel sad. My boat is laden with sorrow. Where will it flow down? Why not accept my love? I love your talent. Your Shoshi married the Emperor, Let me return to my home in Echizen. Why the country? In town, you can enjoy life. Let me go. No one else rejected me. Why? Tell me. Someday... we shall meet again. There she is! Mother! Welcome home! I'm back. Welcome back. Why not ride? I prefer walking. The same old sister! Kataiko, we'll be able to live together. Here? Forever? Yes. I'll settle down. Welcome back! Welcome back! Regent Michinaga. As I recall, life in town seems like a vision. Its beauty is like a rainbow supported by countryside. Those crickets will stop chirping soon. Mother... Hold me... Like that. I'm glad. Hikaru! Hikaru GENJI! Murasakinoue! It's me, Koremitsu. This is the Spring Pavilion Murasakinoue lives here. Murasakinoue! You see? She's there. What are you saying? They're dogs. Lady Murasakinoue died last autumn. Is that so? She wanted to become a nun, but he didn't permit it. She couldn't run away. But after she fell ill, Young Akashi whom she reared nursed her devotedly. Their affection was touching. Murasakinoue was so beautiful... Since she died, Hikaru has been absent-minded. Your love letters. I think this is all. Hikaru, let's play kemari again. You need some exercise. You were good. I couldn't beat you. Burning love letters. I wished I would enjoy a thousand year love with you. But I am left alone with nothing but memories of you. I'm afraid. Where am I going? Tell me. Where to, after I die? Don't worry, Your Excellency. This is the benevolent Buddha. Where will I go? Maybe hell, because I killed people. Grasp this cord, Your Excellency. Look. It leads to Buddha's hand. I can't see him. Where am I? My dear, this cord ties your hands to Buddha's. Take another to make sure. All I do is grab it? Yes. Buddha will personally guide you to heaven. No! I don't want to go! Souls travel in the sky, but I cannot see them even in a dream. Should you see their vision, Ask them where they want to go. Sister. Is your story revenge against your husband? Or against Regent Michinaga who resembled him? I have no idea. People will understand someday that It's only women who gnash their teeth. Gnash their teeth? Kataiko. In your generation let women choose their men. Men they love. Why? It's so abrupt... Let's help the fishermen. Help them? Mother! The Tale of GENJI, the world's first novel, was written 1000 years ago.
