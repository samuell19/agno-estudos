ANNOUNCER: Attention, please. Flight number 10 has arrived at gate number three. [MUSIC PLAYING] [HORN HONKING] -Hey! You kids get out of there! [MUSIC PLAYING] -Oh, no. Mmm. Finish up. -I don't got no more room. -You sure your stomach ain't hurting? -No, I'm just a little full. How come we have to eat so early? -'Cause I've gotta go to work, and Dad's got to go to work. If he don't get home sooner, we're both gonna be late. -I bet he's hanging around that old house again. -Or scavenging? -What's scavenging? -Never mind. Hey, you stay around here, you hear? -OK. -Got your chicken? -Yeah. And if you get to feeling feverish, you come right on back in here. You hear? -OK. -That hurt? -[INAUDIBLE]. -Oh. I've had enough of those growing pains. You're gonna be just like my brothers. Start off little and skinny, then you grow up in a spurt. You'll see. -I'm not skinny. I'm wiry. -Wiry. [DOOR SLAMS] -Mom? -What? -Something I forgot. -What? -They having a last stretch picnic tomorrow. Can I go? It only costs $5. -Well, ask your daddy. -No, you ask him. -Why can't you? -He always says no to me. -That's not so. -It seems like ever since he got that idea of that old house. -Vandy, that's your daddy's dream. -Dreams are for sleeping. -Yo. Blue. -Yeah, how you doing, Tempo? -Hey, man, how's it going? -Everything's fine. -Listen, you got my teeth? -No. Thank you. -Hey, Blue. I've got an idea, man. -Yeah. -I'd like to sit down and rap on you, man, when you've got some time. -But I don't have time right now, thank you. -Listen, man, I can put you [INAUDIBLE]. -No thank you. -What'd you say, Blue? -No thank you. -OK, man. -Ha! I'm here. -Hey. Dinner's ready. I think it's a little dried out. Sorry. -Sorry I was late, too late coming in. -You better learn to phone. -It cost $0.35. People tip a quarter. -What was it this time, cinder block or brick? -I found a rubber tire on the side of the road. -Come on, the least you could do is [INAUDIBLE]. -Where's Vandy? -Outside. -I thought told you not to let him go running around with that gang outside. -Well, yes, you told me-- -Well, then-- -If you want to keep him home, one of us has got to stay home nights. Otherwise you can put the locks on the outside and keep him in, Blue. How long's it gonna be like this? -Till we get something of our own. And this is one day's tip closer [INAUDIBLE]. And we're getting there. -Yeah, but Vandy needs likes now. He needs his winter clothes, and-- -Vandy's gonna get his. -I think we better be going before we both lose our jobs. I think one thing, Blue. You keep putting every crumb you make into that house envelope, leaving us nothing for right now, I just as soon quit at the hospital where I make no money anyhow and go back to working for my ladies. -No, you ain't either. No. If you're gonna clean a house, you clean your own house. You get that nursing degree just like you always wanted. You ain't gonna be Serena the cleaning lady, cleaning up white ladies' houses. You gonna be Mrs. Blue in your own home. Now you understand that? Huh? Mrs. Blue in her own home. -One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10. -Hey! Come on out, Vandy. Vandy, come on. Come on out. -Let me go! Let me go! -How you doing? -You made me lose. -Come on, do something else now. Go on in the house so you can read. -I want to stay out. -I said go on in the house and read. -Why don't you stay? How come you got to go all the time? -I've got to go all the time so we don't have to live in a place like this. -I want to stay out. -And I said go in the house, now you want one upside the head or what? -One half hour, OK? -OK. -You be in that house in a half hour! -Honey, I had to, Blue. -You had to tell him to stay when I told him to go? Serena, we've got to pull together. -I know when you're getting so tight on the boy he's pulling away from you. -Says who? -You can't see your own son coming close to hating you? -The boy don't hate me. -You know, Blue, ever since you got this house bug, you're different. And you're pinching, and scrounging, and working, and-- You think that's made you an easier daddy to your son? -I did it all for him. And it's all for you. -You think it's made you an easier man for me? -Eh, then, what would rather have me do? Do you want me out there on a hustle with Tempo so you won't know if I'm coming home or if I be in jail all night? You want me to be some kind of rum dumb drunk so you can go out and do all the work and pay all the bills? That make it easier on you? -I'm not saying you're not a good man, Blue. -What you saying and what you afraid of? -You, letting the young years of Vandy's life slip away without you being in any part of them. And me, losing the man I want to a rotten old house I'll never get. Now that's what I'm afraid. And if you can't see it, you're blind. And you expect me to teach him [INAUDIBLE]? -I'm going to work. The sooner I start, the sooner I finish. I don't know what you talking about. -[INAUDIBLE]. -Hm? -Go on. -You want to go to work with me? -Where? -We're gonna unload Esmeralda, then I'm going out on the side of the road and see what I can pick up. You could be my helper, help me whatever I miss. You see it, I'll give you a half. I mean like you get a cement brick or something like, you know, maybe five $0.05 or something like, I give you half of it. Or you could work according to time. How do you want to do it? -No thanks. I'd rather [INAUDIBLE]. -What was that for? See, you asked me to do things with him, and then that. -He wants to be your son, Blue. You ain't hiring no helper. He's your child. -Say, Vandy. Now listen, sometimes a man says one thing and he means something else. Now, I'm gonna have a lonely time in that car by myself. And, what I'm trying to say is that I need some company and help. -That's all right. I can help you too. -All right, good. Then we get Esmeralda emptied out and get her rolling. -What's scavengers? -Scavengers? Why you ask that? -Momma says you're the world's greatest scavenger. -Oh yeah. Well, a scavenger is when you find value in things that other people throw away. Scavenging is like-- like looking for a used transmission to buy, you see, instead of brand new one that's gonna cost us $18 zillion and that just maybe the difference that's gonna get us ahead, you see? You, me, and your momma-- scavenging. -Thank you, son. Man, you got enough stuff here to fix up 10 houses. -I've gotta get the first one first. -Hey, you go to the bank like I said? -No, sir. -Why not? They've always been nice to me. -Oh, yeah, sure, 'cause you got a collateral. You got this place. All I got for collateral is these, hands, and they don't give money at the bank for hands. -Look, how much would it cost you to fix it up? -About $500, $600, but that's one step forward and two steps back, man. -Yeah, but, I think you're going about it the wrong way, man. -Well, that's the only way I know, working. -And if I was you, I'd see the numbers man. I tell you, he's a runner. -I ain't looking for no numbers man. -Look, man, you're at the airport every day. You're at the station at night, and all the cruising that you do around here. I think you're perfect. -I'm not looking for no hustling. -It pays a yard and a half to $200 a week, man, to have right in the palm of your hand, plus a bite every time somebody's got hit. You want me to talk to him for you? -No, sir. All I want you to do is see if you can find a transmission that'll fit Esmeralda. You got anything else you want me to pick up or deliver anywhere? -No, not today. Hey, speaking of picking up, Tempo might want to run down to New York. -No, I don't want to have nothing to do with Tempo. I don't want to pick up nothing. I don't want to deliver nothing. You see, I don't want to spend time in that grey [INAUDIBLE] college up there with no hustler. Vandy! Vandy, come on! Hey, come on. Hurry up. [MUSIC PLAYING] That's a nickel you missed. -Never gonna get that crazy house. -Now why you say that? -Just think it's impossible. How come you got that whole envelope of money? We can't have things. -Things like what? -Color on the TV. -So you can watch all the things that you can't have in color instead of black and white? And what else? -You got two jobs. Momma's got a job. Saturdays and Sundays, you do hauling, and we still got nothing but Esmeralda. Tuti's daddy, he just got one job, but he's got a Cadillac. -Tuti's daddy's got to hustle. -What's a hustle? Hustle is like when the big boys took the little boys lunch money on the way to school. That's the hustle. Hustle is like when, uh, you want to do something, and you want some money, and you don't care how much money you get or what you do or how you get it. I mean, that's a hustle. There ain't no reason for it. -You really want this old house? -Vandy, this ain't no rattle old house. See, this is one step forward and no steps backwards for you, me, and your mom. Now today, it may look like some ratting old house. But you see, I look ahead, see. No looking now. See I say that this place one day will be ours to live here, place you can grow up in, quiet, peaceful, like people, sure, like people. Now what do you say to that, Vandy? -Don't know. -All right, Vandy, what is it that you want besides Cadillacs and color TV, which I'm not handing out today? -Well, there's a study trip coming up for school, five days in Washington. Get to ride a n train and everything. -All right, now what-- what's that cost? -$75. -Vandy, $75. $75, son, that's-- that's a whole lot of money. $75 is the new wallpaper for your momma. Vandy, $75 is, uh, a new john and toilets. $75 could give you your own room with a little hiding hole for you to read in. $75 is a lot of money, Vandy. -There's a picnic this afternoon at the church. That's only $5. Can I go in that at least? -Well, we'll see how today goes. -We'll see. I know what that means. -It's mostly for you, because I'm used to it. My daddy used to say, even the best seed have trouble growing up in poor soil. The projects are, you know, and that's the poor soil. You're trying to grow up and live right. That's all there is to it, Vandy. So don't get mad with me. Cadillacs and color TV ain't never got nobody up and out of no place, just keeping there forever, paying the bill. But this house will. All right, I'm gonna sell these two tires, see if I can get some hauling work. You want to help? -Only if I have to. -Well, how you gonna pay for my window? -It's not your window. It's not your house. -Well, it will be one day, dime by dime and dollar by dollar. No, neither one of them grow on trees. You have to dig. That was a lucky hunch, got me a run to Hartford. -Can I come? -Nope. All right, you helped me good today. Now, you earned this $5. Go on the picnic. And don't overdo! -All filled up. You're supposed to sign up ahead anyway. -Vandy, I gotta drop you off at hope. -That's OK. I know where I live. -[INAUDIBLE]. They for the church. You can lick the spoon afterwards. Where's your daddy? -Had to run to Hartford. -You been fighting? -No. -He say anything about coming home on time for the church supper? -No. -Stop scratching all the time. First scratch you get [INAUDIBLE]. You keep picking at them and they'll never heal. Come on in here. -You're picking on me just like Daddy now. -No, well, don't you go bad mouthing your daddy. Lift up. You could have lots worse. -You don't like Daddy any more than me, Daddy working all the time. That's hard for us. -Now listen, what I say to your daddy when we get to fussing and you've got to right to say is two different things. Working full time, taking home full pay since he wasn't much older than you. If you come up to half the man he is, then you're on your way. Stop picking and scratching! -I can't help it. It just don't heal. -See that's what your daddy wants to get away from-- dirty garbage, you getting sick all the time. As fast as you clean up, it's dirty again. Where's that form you brought home from school about the physical? -Up there or somewhere else. What you gonna do? -See if I can get one of the doctors at the hospital to look you over. Want the lickee spoon? -No. -Want to walk over to the church with me, help the ladies set up for the supper? -I want to help no ladies. -I'll be back. -When you think Dad will be back? -I don't know. I suppose it depends on whether he picks up a lot of run or not. -We never do know for sure, do we? -No. But it's all for better things some day. -How come everything has to be some day? How come there's never anything good right now? [MUSIC PLAYING] -You all right? -Mm? -Is your daddy home? -No. -Get dressed. We're going to the supper. -Maybe he's messing around at that old house. -I said get dressed. -Will we go look and see if he's at that house? -No. Yes. Do that. -Morning. -Morning. -Morning. -Good morning. -Vandy, go change out of your church clothes. What happened last night? -I [INAUDIBLE]. To Hartford and then wait for them to reload, take something up to Boston, and then I found three high rows on [INAUDIBLE]. We're getting lucky. -We are? -Now, I figure. I was looking at our property again. See, we could make a garden right here that grows from green beans, cabbage, and turnips. Now [INAUDIBLE] of the year we're growing all this. What we don't eat, we can sell on the side of the road here. And what we don't sell, then we can can. [DOOR BUZZING] -Hey. -Hi, Vandy, how you doing? -Pretty good. -Hi, I'm Tim. -Hi. -Hi, Serene. -Hi, Daniel. -Hi, Blue. Nice to see you. Uh, we're sending the kids to playland, so we stopped by and thought maybe we could take Vandy out. -Can I? -Ask your daddy? -It'll be no bother, Blue. Be glad to have him. -Going in the Cadillac? -Sure, man, all the way and back again. What do you say, Blue? -I've got some work to do around the house. -Aw, listen, you can't be working all the time. Matter of fact, why don't you come and go along? And we can set down and rap. -Ah, I've got some work to do around the house, and I was including Vandy in it. -Sure, man. Sure. Well, Vandy, catch you around the next time, kid. OK, let's go, fellas. -I hate you. -Now stop that! Go on. Catch them. -What did you do that for? You know it's just a waste of money going on that trip when that boy gets sick every time. -Fun for a kid is no waste. You know, there's something you left out of your system of living out of envelopes, Blue. You and your whole life, all wrapped up inside of an envelope. -Yeah, I've got all my dreams in an envelope. -And no room in it for Vandy and me. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Turn off all that noise! You all right? -[INAUDIBLE]. -I'm still [INAUDIBLE]. -It was nothing but $7.50 in pop and all that other junk he ate. He's hurting, and groaning, [INAUDIBLE]. -Don't you think you should be staying at home? -Yes, I think I ought to stay home today. But I just shifted from the night hours to day hours so that I could be home nights, and now this had to happen. -I just hate to see him with all aches and pains and have to miss school again. -I know. I'm gonna [INAUDIBLE]. [INAUDIBLE] doctor's giving him a good physical. -Well, that's good. Now you're talking, because I think it's appendicitis, and you tell him that. I said all of them hot dogs and junk. -Now Blue, if you want to say I told you so, why don't you say it? -Because if I did, then you just said it never would have happened if I had been with him. I'm sorry. -I just got [INAUDIBLE]. -I'll call the people at the taxi cab place and tell them I ain't working on them. -No, don't ever do what you don't want to do. -Well, sis, I got pictures in my mind of how to live. I just have trouble telling them. -They're dreams. -Yeah. But they're better dreams than what's at the bottom of a bottle. They're better than playing the numbers, and better then taking any amount of dope. And they get us further than any Cadillac. And I know I'm gonna get where them dreams is going. Because I where we at is-- I mean it's like-- you ever see them like mice in a cage, and all they do is just running their little legs, just keep going round and round on that wheel, just keep running, running, running, don't ever go no place. Well, I'm running, but I'm running to get off of that wheel. And it's like living right with some kind of show. And all we get to do is watch. [HORN HONKING] Well, I'm raising the price so I can get in on it. [HORN HONKING] Take care, baby. -Mhm. [HORN HONKING] [PROTESTERS CHANTING] -Who's striking? -The engineers. -Planes still coming in? -I don't know. I guess we got deaf people doing their jobs. -As long as the planes coming in, you've got something to clean up, and I've got luggage to hall. -You gonna cross the line? and I've got luggage to hall. -You gonna cross the line? -Ain't my strike, and it ain't my fight. -Ain't my strike, and it ain't my fight. and I don't get nothing from those pensions. -I don't know. -Hey, man, look, if we struck for $3.50 an hour, you think they'd be out here standing with us? And besides, I don't see no blood catcher out here. -Wait, a minute, Blue. -No, man, [INAUDIBLE] finding out. I need all the [INAUDIBLE] I can carry home. -They can put the book on you, Blue. You cross, and they pass the word. -Is that a fact? -My cousin, it happened to him in Newark. The first thing after the [INAUDIBLE] settled, he was let out. Face it, they've got the power. And you know it. -You a foreman? -Yeah. -I need some work. -I can get you some work. How's your back? -It's fine. -Good. $3 an hour, go over and see John. Hey, John! -Blue? -Vandy! Vandy! Got home early. -Oh, yeah. I was thinking this garden ain't gonna make any money. I think we could turn it into some kind of nursery school or something, you know, for kids, for working ladies' kids. -No, honey. -Now look, I was thinking we take that barn and split it in half and half of it be for my shop, and the other half will be for the kids in the wintertime, you know, like on [INAUDIBLE]. -Blue. -And then you get that degree from that practical nursing school so mothers will be blocking to bring their kids in here. Because I figure like 25 kids, $0.25 each kid for every hour, that's $6 and-- -One half. You get laid off? -No, no, there was a strike out at the airport. -How long? -Oh, I guess for a day or so, but that don't make no difference. I got a construction work coming through the week, maybe longer. -I'm going back to day work, Blue. -No, you ain't. -Yes, I am. I mean, we both be better off. Look, Blue, you don't realize how the world is going. You're always looking ahead somewhere. You don't look around you. There's a depression going on. I heard it at the hospital, people saying things don't get worse before they get better. Money's tight, Blue, everybody knows it. -Well, see, maybe that'll make things work better for us. They may even lower the price, so we can get started sooner. We may-- they may even take $1,000 down. -Blue, you've got your choice. Now it's either me and Vandy or it's that crazy, rotten, never be nothing shack. -Mrs. Blue, it's Vandy. -What's the matter with Vandy? -He passed out, clutching on his stomach. He's kind of like fighting for breath. -Where is he? -A guy ran him over to the hospital and told him where I'd probably find you. -It's not the first time, Mr. Blue. Vandy's always fighting for breath, it seems like. -Feeling better? -Mhm. -Does that still hurt? -Just a little. -That's good. Now look. We're gonna let you go home. The first thing I want you to do is rest. -What you gonna do with all that blood you took? -We drink it. OK, Serena, you can dress him up. I could check him in tonight, but I don't want to move without a thorough hematological work up, less blood testing analysis of a lot of different factors. -You think it's his heart? -Well, I'm reserving diagnosis right now. Look, he's just as well off at home tonight if you keep him quiet. -Hm. -I'll call you the minute I can arrange a consultation with a specialist. Ah. Does it hurt here sometimes? -Sort of. -He's scrawny, ain't he? -Vandy, will you, uh, wait outside for a moment please? -You gonna take [INAUDIBLE]. -That's right, now scoot. -It don't hurt much. -[LAUGHS] -[INAUDIBLE] -Yeah. [PHONE RINGING] -It's Blue residents. Yes, doctor. Oh, just-- just one-- one second. Get a pencil and paper. My wife's getting a pencil and paper. Yes, sir. St. Vincent Hospital. Dr. Folkman. Uh, pediatrics. -Got it. -Yeah. 8:45 AM. Thank you. He wants us to take Vandy over there 8:45 in the morning, says he's got an idea about what may be wrong with him. And this man will look at him. Don't you [INAUDIBLE] ever talk about what maybe wrong with Vandy? -I don't tell, Blue. -Well, he took some blood from my son. There must be something wrong with us or something we did. -I don't know it. I just give back rubs and make beds. Whatever it is, it sure ain't growing pains. -They'll find out. -Well, he wants me to get some clothes for him. He says he's gonna stay a little while. Now don't worry. 'Cause what Vandy needs, he's gonna get. -Blue. -Huh? -What he needs is you. -All right. -You. [MUSIC PLAYING] -You feeling all right? -I guess so they don't take no more blood. -Well, whatever they do, as long as they get you straightened out so you can make that Washington trip. -Even if you're not working? -Even if. 'Cause the strike can't last forever. Man can always find work with his hands, 'cause he a man. -Hey, look at that. Look. -I was supposed to have a-- -Take a number. -We're supposed to have an appoint-- -No, take a number. The clinic don't open till 9:00. -We're supposed to have an appointment with a doctor Folkman at 8:45. The name is Vander Blue, Jr. -Well, it's the first I heard about it. Now take a number. -I'm Dr. Folkman. -Blue. -Let's go. We'll be just fine. [MUSIC PLAYING] Mr. Blue? Mr. Blue, I want to talk to you about Vandy. -What you doing home? -I heard, so I wanted to be here. Dr. Folkman, the consultant-- -Yeah. -He called to tell Dr. Price that he was right and-- they're gonna keep Vandy for a while. I've got some coffee on. -No. What else did he tell you? That he had sickle cell anemia. -Yeah. He had a whole lot of doctor talk about sickle cell anemia. Says that, uh, says that you carry it and I carry it. And that's called a trait. And Vandy's got it, and that's called congenital. Says it's red blood cells is what's-- what's going it. They're fit moon shaped, and that they carry oxygen to the veins and that Vandy's ain't moon shaped, all these shaped like a sickle, you know, the would cut the weeds with. And they jammed up the oxygen supply in the veins, so he's got it in the joints, and in the lungs, and in the heart. -How come only black kids get it? -Just because. -Why? -Don't ask me why. Why don't you ask the preacher why-- why there's tall, why there's short, why there's smart, why there's dumb, why there's black, why there's white. And why is the sun? It ain't our fault. We ain't done nothing. -Did they say what they're gonna do? -They say he's gonna give us some medicine and keep him quiet. Give him some blood, make him stronger so he can hold out longer. Now what all did they tell you? -Oh, mostly what you said. How, um, you get born with it and how a bad infection can set it off like the sores on Vandy's feet, how he always seems to keep a cold, how only black children just [INAUDIBLE]. -He's gonna die. Didn't he tell you that, Serena? We're gonna lose him, Serena. And [INAUDIBLE] to the sickness, and Vandy's sickness is that he was born black and poor. -[CRIES] [MUSIC PLAYING] [PHONE RINGING] -Hello? Oh, yes, doctor. Yes. Thank you very much. -What? -We can bring him home tomorrow. -Well, I'm gonna go take a walk. -Don't, Blue, stay here. -No, I got to-- I got to take a walk. I've got to figure out how to tell him about dying. Honey, it just wouldn't be fair for him to hear it from somebody else or for it to slip out from one of us. And you know how his ears are around this house. So I'm gonna take a walk. -Do you want me to? -Naw. It's my job. -He's our child, Blue. -Yeah, but he's my son. [MUSIC PLAYING] It's all signed out and paid for. Here's Vandy's discharge paper. Why don't you go ahead and bail him out. -Why don't you go get him, Mrs. Blue. Any questions about home care, just call me, anytime. -Can he, uh, should he go to school? -Sure, for a while, as long as his strength is up to it. -Thank you. -Mr. Blue? The sickle cell research programs have all they can handle. -Is that so? -But there's a new program starting up in San Francisco. I'd like to try to get Vandy in. -Why's they got a cure? -No. -Well, what does it do? -Research. -Research? Research. If they a got no cure, it's kind of, you know, I just work. And all the work I do is around here, so-- I couldn't send Vandy out there. I mean, things ain't going that well here. -We'll keep in touch. -Yeah. -Any questions? -Questions, um, I'm just thinking about rich folks when they-- when they find out their son [INAUDIBLE] kids. Well, they just drop everything, and they take them to Disneyland all around the world, something like that. And I just-- well, you know-- poor folks want to do-- you know what they want to give their kid something. You know the furthest Vandy's every been? -Uh uh. -Right here. Listen, thank you. [MUSIC PLAYING] Now, just between you and I, your ma's got a coming home things going, so we'll give her some time, all right? -Mhm. -Vandy, I want to talk to you about people. You see there's-- there's three kinds of people. There's yesterday people. There's tomorrow people. And there's today people. My father, he's yesterday people. Everything's yesterday. Hell, well, I'm telling you right now. You could talk about all the cars you want to, but there ain't nothing like riding in the back of that wooden wagon when I was a kid, coming home from work. That was the way my daddy talked, always say everything was yesterday. And when we moved up east and started working, Dad would still say, yeah, well, you really don't know the value of a dollar until you chop some cotton when the sun is down on you. That's your granddaddy, my father, yesterday. Now your daddy. -That's you? -Yeah, that's me. You know what kind of people your daddy is? -I don't know. -Tomorrow. See, I'm a tomorrow people. Everything is tomorrow, some day my whole life in that envelope, and all my dreams in that house-- chickens, a garden was even gonna build a little nursery. Dreaming and scheming. Saving and craving. But no more, Vandy, no more. -No more what, Daddy? -Ain't gonna be no more front porch, no batty hens, no living in the spirit of fear of today. No more being afraid. Living for today. Me, and you, and your mom, we're gonna do today people. -Why? -Because everything that's important is what you can put your hands on today. -So all this talking, 'cause I got sick? -Especially coming back to us. -Daddy? -Yeah. Close it 'cause I'm gonna die? -Why you say that? -Am I gonna die? -Yeah. You-- [INAUDIBLE]. When is not important. Everybody's got to die sooner or later. It's like traveling, see, some people make a short trip. Some people make a long trip. What's important is how-- how you make the trip. Daddy and child make into as much together as can be. -Not putting it off tomorrow today. -Got it. Got it. All right, son, now you know. Now I want to know what you want to do. Even if I had enough money in my pockets so I could buy you all the things in the world and you couldn't even see for looking, I mean, things ain't gonna change things. Now I want to give you whatever you want today, if I can. Now what about that trip to Washington for five days? I mean, is that what you want? -What do you want? -Now, I want to know what you want. -I ain't gonna [INAUDIBLE]. -Well, now don't worry about the money, because I can scrape it up. -It's not the money. -Well, what is it? -Well, if I was to go away and get sick, I would just want you now. -Yeah, but it's important to get the Washington. You'd get to sight-seeing, having a ball. Now, wouldn't you want that? -No, I'd only just want you. Everything still feels the same, Daddy. I can't see nothing different but you and me. -Go on and wash your hands. -They're clean. -Go on wash your hands. -Can I go out to play? -[LAUGHS] -No, you can't go out to play. -Why? -Because your momma baked a special cake for you. And later on when we get finished, I got some place special to take you, me, and your momma. We're gonna make a little trip. -Where we going? -Now don't you worry about. You remember what I told you and a trip and making it together, Daddy and son? Well, this is it, just like that song that you always listening to. You with the one. You went and loved the one you're with. -I'm sorry, Dad, you're not too hip. -Yeah, you don't get it. Vandy, get in the boat. -You're kidding? -I'm not kidding. Get in the boat. All right, come on, Serena. -You can't go messing with other people's boats. -This ain't other people's boats. I put $50 down, $200 at the garage, give me $150 for that stuff in the back of my car, now come on. -No, you all go on. He's your I -No, he's our child. Now, come on. Say, come on. Help your momma get in the boat. Come on, now. Easy. Momma in the boat. All right now. Vandy, here you go. You're the captain. Put it on and say when. -Let's go. -Let's go. All right. You know what I was thinking about this boat? It works so fine, we can rent this out for fishing parties. And then we can smoke the fish and sell it. You know how [INAUDIBLE]. -Don't get started! -Cast off there, captain! Make a hard right, anchor, starboard. All right, Vandy, say goodbye to all your friends on shore. [MUSIC PLAYING]
