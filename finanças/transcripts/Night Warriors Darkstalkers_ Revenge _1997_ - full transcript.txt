The Dark shall be with us always. I would crush even the Moon herself so that it is preserved. Oh-ho, you would challenge me then, is that it? What can be your reason? Is it merely to see who is greatest? If you will stake your life on the outcome, I shall consent, but be warned: Your curiosity may prove your greatest mistake. I must admit, a game to see who lives or dies is magnificent. I am a Vampire Hunter... ...and I make it my vow that I will rid this world of The Dark! NIGHT WARRIORS Return of the Darkstalkers Uncivilized brutes they are, these humans. On this, the glorious occasion of my Lord Demitri going into battle... ...one might have hoped they'd make a better effort. You do realize how shabby an affair the party below is? And here I had been thinking the humans were clever creatures. Is not a lifetime of faithful servitude to me... ...the greatest happiness their kind can attain? The machinations of the Others confuse them, my lord. The humans begrudge your hiding of the sun... ...while the Others resent your descent to Earth, this century past. No doubt they comfort themselves in plotting my downfall. The human is a friend to be loved indeed. At last, the time has come. One hundred years later... ...at last I am able to avenge my defeat back in the Demon World. Your so-called "defeat" was but a minor setback, My Lord. After your time here on Earth, the strength you've gained... ...will make certain your new role as ruler of the Demon World. Spare me your comforts. That I was defeated in the Demon World and exiled to Earth is only fact. However, the humans have restored me... ...and now I hold custody of the greatest power of all. With your help, I can finally take revenge against the demon world. Tonight is the night I must give thanks to you all! The sounds of your agony and suffering... ...are the greatest gift you can bestow upon me. Take it away! What're you trying to do... ...rob an old demon of his sleep for the next four hundred years!? Demitri Maximoff... Now there's a name I never expected t' hear again in these parts. I thought he'd given up tryin' t' take over the Demon World. Now this is a fine mess... Hadn't we best inform the Mistress before acting? What, and interrupt her big matchmaking shindig? Where in the blazes is she, anyway? She, uh, said she was bored, Sir, and left the castle. Why, I'll be... Then we've been sitting around with our thumbs up our asses for nothing!? She's young yet, is the Mistress. Give 'er time. With this, we got it made in the shade! Boss Demitri best be thankin' us. It ain't every day ya score one o' dese. Who's there!? You've no need of that. While I, on the other hand... Morrigan Aeslaed! Dat succubus broad! How is it you serve your Master so willingly? Have you no desire to rise against this Demitri and take his throne? Those who have lost their pride lose also their right to live. Demitri Maximoff... ...sounds like an intriguing man. Come one, come all! Something wonderful this way comes! Come have a purr-fect time at the latest show from Lady Felicia... ...the up-and-coming star of the musical world! Okay, I've got the public performance license for Darkstalkers. Guess all I need now is a license for the human world. Say, do either of you know where the human world City Hall is? They won't hold long, but the spirit-wards are in place. Good job. All of you, don't let your guards down. I don't want a single Darkstalker to get through! No sir! Gentlemen, I want you to look at these very carefully. I'm sure it's nothing you haven't seen before. Hell, these are the kinda crops we eat every day! What I wanna know is: When the hell did we start acceptin' these... ...runty little bastards as normal!? The problem is the sun... or should I say, the absence of it. How long... How long since the Dwellers of the Dark came... ...and robbed humanity of its nourishing and essential light!? The sun was once a source of life and prosperity for all mankind. But now the Darkstalkers have come and stolen it from us... ...hidden it away, our very own sun! In order for man to prosper, we need its warming light! At this rate, we, too, will go the way... ...of our stunted and deformed crops. This is a dark time, and dark times demand desperate measures. Damn the cost; we must stand and fight! Perhaps if we timed our attack to Demitri Maximoff's return... ...to the Demon World, we could... As you see, the supplies have been readied... ...and our allies contacted for the coming assault. We await your signal. Good man! Even if this Demitri should survive his trip... ...to the Demon World, he'll be in no shape to fight. At that moment, we'll move against him, and take back what he's stolen from us! No price is too high to win back our light! Wha... What's that smell? This town, it smells all wrong. How's it goin', mates? If ya wanna see a real show, show me the freakin' money an' c'mon in. Hm? Whatsa matter, pussycat? I don't do autographs till after the show. 'Course, that's assumin' you'll still be able t' walk after my performance. You're one of the Dark Ones, aren't you? I can tell... from the smell. We don't say "Dark Ones" anymore. The politic'lly correct term's Darkstalkers. This town smells all wrong. My senses are a mess. Somethin' bad's about t' happen. I can smell it in the air. "Smell"? I don't smell a damn thing. I just think you should be careful. Something's gonna happen; I know. You're damn right something's gonna happen. I'm playin' tonight, ain't I? I put out for them with my music... ...then they put out a bit o' their souls for me. A fair an' equitable business arrangement. Are you ready to rock!? Bloody hell. This crowd's so dead, it's startin' t' attract flies. It's a bad smell, all right. Garlic. Silver bullets. That crap don't affect me none. Flamethrowers, on the other hand... That's fine with me. Looks like it's time t' roast-or-be-roasted. Not bad for a bunch of holy rollers. - There's another of 'em! - Burn it! You okay over there!? No mercy for women nor furry animals? For a bunch of monks, you've sure got some nasty habits an' dark hearts. I like it! When it comes t' feastin' on souls, I always did prefer the dark meat. Here I come, baby! The show ain't over yet! Don't ya wanna buy a T-shirt!? Whaddya say, kitty-cat? You want I should save ya a couple of souls? Thanks for the offer, but I'm not much for organized religion. I'm kinda nondenominational, myself. Do it. Stand aside. I need no guide to the Demon World. I would not forget the way to Demon King Belial in a mere century. I've seen many men come and go. Will you be weak and pathetic like the others? And what are you? I've grown so weary of the Demon World, you see. Won't you amuse me? Milady... ...I would love to. Chivalry lives. I see the Demon World yet holds true. The hundred years I spent on Earth building this power... ...have not been wasted. I almost regret that the outcome of our little match has been decided. There can be but one victor today. And that is me. You fight well enough. It's been a while since I've had such an enjoyable battle. But I do wish you wouldn't talk quite so much. Powerful life-signs detected. Powerful life-signs detected. Exterminating target immediately. Protect Lord Demitri! Soul Fist! That act barely warrants my thanks. Your castle is burning, or hadn't you noticed? Go down and fight. If not for your own sake, then for the Demon World. Mistress! Beelzebub's bollocks! Where'd those things come from!? What power could have summoned them? How can Demitri have built such a large battalion!? If they're his, why are they attacking his castle!? Lady Morrigan, please! We're gonna get in trouble! Just as soon as I finish here... Help! Help! Somebody help! You are unworthy of being my enemy. The targets possess extreme power. It may prove necessary to alter attack parameters... Where are they from? What unknown opponent... ...would use them against me to attack my life? Soul Fist! That was close. If you've had enough, can we go back now, please!? Oh, very well. Fifteen killed in one night. At this rate, not a one of us will be left standing. In other words, this village is dead. There's no hope for we old folk, but, perhaps if you younger folk... ...were to run away, you could escape the curse... ...an' live on for the rest of us. And where're we supposed to run? With so many Dark Ones, one place is as bad as another. O Brave Youths... Know that, where you are about to go there is no darkness. Surely the Lord will comfort you always... ...with the warmth of His heavenly light. Know also that, in the light of the Lord, all your sins shall be forgiven. May you rest in peace. The Lord is with them. Knowing full well their battle... ...with the Dark Ones could never be won. Still they fought bravely with no regret. "Never be won"? Are you suggestin' we just lay down and let them kill us!? You don't really think we have a chance of surviving this, do you? Ask the dead who they think will be the winner. Their eyes are answer enough. Then I s'ppose you agree with the old man... ...that we should abandon the village. Don't you realize we've no place to run to? Besides, the Dark Ones are already on their way... The Dark Ones are coming here, you say!? But that doesn't make any sense! What could they possibly want!? So. The girl's name is Anita, you say. Her eyes... They're just so... strange. We're just a group of traveling performers. Nothing special. When we got to the last town, though... ...everyone had been killed by the Dark Ones. That li'I girl were the only one who weren't half-eaten. What were we supposed t' do, just leave her there? So we took her with us. But then, right after that, the Dark Ones started appearin'... ...everywhere we went. Are you telling me the Dark Ones are after the girl? She ain't bad. She's just diff'rent. It's 'cause of her power, even though it's only a little one... "Only a little one"!? Surely her power cannot be as "little" as you'd have me believe. That child survived an attack that wiped out an entire town. There must be something more to her than we're seeing... ...something for which the Dark Ones would go to great lengths to possess. To keep the girl a secret will cause more trouble... ...for those who've seen too much death already. Please, Father! We want to do what's right for everyone. Tell us what we should do! Hey, look what I found. A stupid lion costume! Whadda they think we are, a buncha kids!? Like we'd really believe they're lion tamers! Hey! Take a look at this! Now this is what I'd call the real thing. Whaddya y' think? Should we steal it? I dunno. We'll be in big trouble if the priests catch us... So we won't get caught. Hey! Oh, no! She saw us! Hey! You! What're you doing!? That's dangerous... If anybody asks, you didn't see nothin', d'ya got it!? W-Why, you! You think I'm jokin'? Say bye-bye to your doll! C'mon, cut it out! Enough, already. Shut up! I know what I'm doin'. I'm gonna show 'er what'll happen if she talks, that's all... It's a monster! Run for it! You're absolutely sure. She's one of that travelin' bunch? You're not lyin' to us now, is ya? You're sure that's what you saw. Uh-huh. She was usin' black magic an' spells an' everythin'! I swear t' God! I did a little checking myself, and it seems that wherever... ...that troupe goes, the Dark Ones are sure t' follow. They're just like a magnet for them bastards. And now they're claiming sanctuary at the church? While we're sittin' around talkin', good men are gettin' killed! We got no time t' waste! If we don't do somethin', those Dark Ones are gonna kill us all! He's right, it's kill or be killed! Let's do them before they do us! Not yet! We need to talk to the Priest first. I know you're all angry, but let's not forget who's our real enemy! You've got to calm down... Screw you. I'm sick of waitin' t' die... Yeah! Let's all go to the church! Let's kill them 'fore they kill us! Please, you've gotta listen to me! We're fighting Dark Ones, not humans... Do they fight because they cannot coexist? One unable to tolerate the existence of the other? Both sides fighting until the other is destroyed. That is the Way of Man. However, it is also the Way of the Demon. This world yearns for death. C'mon! Get a move on! Light 'er up! That's the way! Do it! Burn it! Burn! Let's do it! If only so as we can live in peace... Why does this world walk the path of madness so willingly? There she is! She's the one! She's the one who's caused all of it! Fire! What th... Your souls are enveloped in darkness. If you value your lives, you will depart this place. Fire! Fire! Hear me now: I despise the Dark. H-He's one of the Dark Ones. Once again, the Dark Power has come forth from me. My poor child. No doubt at your age you cannot understand... ...what could cause a man to turn on his fellow man. I have no choice, you see. My duty is to calm these people, to save as many lives as I can. Their needs outweigh the few. F-Forgive me. The deed is not in me. I cannot take the life of one who does not understand. Priest, this one understands everything. Only the emotion is missing from her eyes. That is true; her eyes are those of a corpse... Do not think she lacks understanding of death. Rather, she has forsaken those emotions... ...which might cause her to react in its presence. Her powers bring her naught but tragedy. Would not you, too, cast aside emotion? My poor child... "Poor child"...is it. Do you not think she is being selfish? She chooses to live as though she has no right of existence. W-What're you doing!? Look! In her eyes, she shows anger... So the child can become angry. It would seem you have some will to live after all. If so, stop running, and choose to live. You have the Eye of a Dark One. True, half the blood in my body is the cursed blood of the Dark. The half that is Dark tries to bury this world in madness. But the half that is Pure will yet triumph... ...over the power of the Dark. But that cannot be! Humans are weak. Nevertheless... ...I tell you I will triumph over the Dark. You cannot. How can you do... ...what cannot be done? Say what you will, but I am a Vampire Hunter. And I say to you now that I will rid this world of the Dark! I-It's no use. The Dark Ones are here... The village is gone! We gotta get outta he... W-Wha...? Extermination target located. Requesting support units. Repeating: Extermination target located. Requesting support units.
