CLEAR YOUR HEAD, CHANGE OF AIR IN THE ALPS! …because of an accident on highway east to the airport. A traffic jam of 15 minutes from Porte de Bercy. As a result, delays throughout the areas between Italy and… FOR SUZANNE, AGNES, RENE, GABRIEL Hi Mom, it's Sandrine. I'm calling because I'll be late. I am in a traffic jam. It is not moving at all. Porte de Bercy, I will be there in half an hour. Do you want to become a farmer? Yes. I passed my interviews. And they accepted me for an agriculture training center. I must begin in September. Beginning of September. I thought I had seen it all with you. But now, you have outdone yourself. Mom… You wouldn't have left Gérard if not for this delusion? It's not a delusion. But anyway, farmer! Who put this idea in your head? No one, Mom. I have always thought about it. But you never told me about it. You see yourself raising pigs, driving a tractor? You will be 30, my poor girl. So put away the farmer's dream and come back to Earth. Exactly, it is time for me to finally do what I want to do! -What does that mean? -You know very well. Mom. I thought IT was best for you. You were a IT trainer. It was meaningful, anyway. You would travel a lot. You would see many people. You have a very nice apartment. You make a great living. You didn't get it, Mom. I can't take it anymore. I am suffocating. I need air, space. Space… -My little girl. -Don't cry. What are you going to do? Don't worry about it. Don't worry about me. I know what I am doing. I don't understand a thing. And what is this now? Come on. …in progress in the northernmost regions, In the afternoon the temperature will reach 60 degrees in Paris. The temperature will continue to rise, like today, reaching 68 degrees. I have a right to be happy, in my old age, in God's name! And everyone laughing at me behind my back, don't you think they would have a Volvo if they had the means? Yes, but what annoys them is not that you have one. It's that you bought it now. When you've always been rich, it doesn't make people jealous. And when you get rich, it makes everyone else feel bad. Ah, so it goes. Some in the valley say that you sold the cheese factory over 200 million old francs. Are you expecting someone? It's the ministry delegate coming for the inventory. For the inventory? I decided to sell. Do you need money? No, that's not it. I'm sick and tired of it. -I can introduce you. -Ah, I'll pass. With these guys, the less I see them, the better off I am. Are you afraid it's going to rain? Listen, earlier, there was a storm in the valley, it took me 15 minutes to turn them on. So now I just leave them like this, if it rains, then, I'll be set. I now understand why they laugh behind your back. I'll come back, and we'll talk some more about it all. -Bye Adrien. -Bye, Jean. Until next time. You have decided to become a farmer in Rhône-Alpes, very good. But I warn you, this is no place for dreamers. Those of you who want to make goat cheese with a guitar slung around you can go home. It's not an option when there are big loans due when you realize you are not cut out for the work. You will be studying for two years learning the methods of farming. Here you will learn theory, and on the field practical training. But then… People there won't be kind to you. Hold the paw, Laurent. Pull it higher. Lift the paw, there. Come quick! Come closer. Come with the whisk. Come. Go ahead, turn it. Get down on your knees. Turn. Turn. It's nothing. Don't stop, go on. Well done, keep moving. Stop! Yeah, that's good. Continue. He's dead, it's over. -It's good, thanks. -There, it's done. It'll be okay. See, you could do it. There. You okay? What did you set up? Finisher one, cleaner six, hopper six. And the Taarup? On the left zero, on the right minus two. Right. You're afraid you're won't be able. -What? -To leave it to me. There's no reason. Let's go. I'll drive the tractor. Okay… I would have liked to see the farm this winter. I know, but the winter has been so rough this year, it was a bit complicated to go up there, so… That said, I'd rather you meet Mr. Rochas in the moment in the Spring. He's not fit for visits in winter? It's not that, just… He lost his wife about ten years ago, so in winter he sees no one. He lives like a bear. That said, if you can handle it, it's no problem. Mr. Rochas? Watch your step here. Hello, sir. I introduce to you Miss Sandrine Dumez who is very interested in your farm. Hello. I hope we're not bothering you. I have to fix a milker by tonight, don't have much time. Listen, if you don't mind, we'll take a tour of the farm. I believe there are seventy-six goats, three bucks of Alpine and white breed. What is the location level of the herd? Seven hundred and ten kilos. For a TP of…? Twenty-eight per one thousand. How? Twenty-eight per one thousand. May I see the rest of the farm? Yes, go ahead, I'll come with. I need a word with Mr. Rochas. Miss. Dumez is the best candidate in the class. A hard-working girl, with lots of energy, never runs out of ideas. I really believe in her. It's been two years since the farm is for sale? I go through all this trouble bringing candidates up here. Young people say: "It's too far away from everything." When I show them the photos of the buildings, well… It does not catch much interest. I'm just asking you, simply, to show a little more goodwill towards these young people. Because the last guy you sprayed, he never got over it. Excuse me, but… Do you know who you bring about? The guy comes to my house and tells me that he wants to be head of operations, not a peasant. Of course I kicked him out. Head of operations. Everyone wants to be in charge now. They will be in charge of nothing at all. They'll do like the ones before them, and that's it. Are you married? No husband, no kids. -Single? -For the moment. If you settle down without a man, you won't last long. And coming here single, you will remain single. There are not many local guys. And they aren't chasing after women who get up at 5:00 in the morning to milk goats. Contrary to what you think, I'm not a city kid trying out farming on a whim. I'm trying to settle down, and live as I see fit, with or without a man. If we work together, let this be clear. I plan on staying in this house for a year and a half. For Miss Dumez, not being able to live on the farm would be an inconvenience. That's all very nice, but where do suggest I go? I'm supposed to get a family house in Grenoble. But it's not vacant for another year, my nephew lives there. I'm not going to kick the kid out. I'll figure something out. In summary, Mr. Rochas… You are selling the whole farm including the buildings. Including all animals and farming equipment, for the amount of 450,000 Francs. Including rental of the orchard and mountain pasture. In addition, you ask to remain in the house for 18 more months. Do we agree on this? There is a pear tree and a cherry tree in the orchard, which I want to continue to use. And I have eight rabbits I want to continue to breed. -Come on… -It's important. If I settle down here, will you help me? Oh, you know… I won't be very helpful to you. To you holding a professional farming certificate. There is no such thing as a farming diploma. And if I sell… It's to rest. Good. I need to think about it. Come on! Let's go! Come on, girls, let's go home! Come on! Come! Come on! Come on, Mouchette. We start with a territory. Clue: Park. Top. British territory with an area of six square kilometers. -Britain conquers it… -Yes? -Gibraltar? -Very good. She seizes the opportunity, right? Come on, let's go. What the hell is she doing? Come on! Fuck this… Over there, come on. If you don't know have time to watch the clouds float by, take a moment at Heaven Balconies and get back to the basics. THE COTTAGE BEFORE - AFTER A quaint farm in Vercors on a preserved site, you can relax in a welcoming and comfortable country house. And if love walking in sublime places like me, I will show you the best routes to take. -Are you coming kids? -Yeah! Are there several cheeses? There are plenty of goat cheeses. Many different types. How many liters does she make a day? -Two of three liters. -Ah, okay. -How old is she? -One month. -How long can she live? -Fifteen years. What are these two… things for? Just for looks, I don't know. Come on, Pharaon! Come on! You coming? You coming or not? So stubborn… What's wrong with Pharaon? Is he okay? Since I got the Volvo, he won't leave the car. He's very stubborn, that's all. Why is there a bus parked in your yard? A school, about thirty kids showed up. They have turned my farm into a tourist attraction. I was this close to get my picture taken. I can tell you it's been going on for a while, the kids. Foreigners, ecologists… She let them stay in the lodge. She is profiting off of the panoramic views and what's more… she lets them eat the cheese. And everything from the orchard. You must admit it's not a bad idea. In any case, at this rate, she will end up earning a living better than you. Yeah. One swallow does not make a summer. When it gets cold, the lodge won't look as tempting. Plus… Sooner or later, she will have to rough it out on the farm. And then, we will see how the Parisian manages. You should see how she takes care of the raspberries. I just took look earlier. Everything's ripe, but… You have to bend down to pick up. -For the apples? -Apple tree! -For the cherries? -Cherry tree! -For the salad? -The bowl! Come on, kids! We are going to pick raspberries. But don't eat them right away, we'll save them for later. Lazy ass. Don't wreck everything. Goodbye, Sandrine! Goodbye! Goodbye kids! HEAVEN BALCONIES CERTIFIES LODGING Good day, Miss. Jean Farjon, Sandrine Dumez. -Hello, sir. -Hello. So, you are in the hotel business? It seems to be working fine. Can't complain, for the moment. You seem brave, no reason it should stop. Thanks. And how is that a beautiful girl like yourself isn't married? You must not run out of suitors. What matters is filling the lodge, the rest can come later. Well, I don't agree. A woman isn't meant to sleep alone. And a man that can be of service when needed. I am speaking of hard land work. I wouldn't dare to mention something else. You'll have to find someone. Don't stay like this. Okay, alright. I promise to think about it. -Goodbye, sir. -Goodbye. Charming. And good-looking, on top of that. I begin to understand why you chose her. Well… Heaven Balconies, good evening. Yes, of course. Hello? Hello? Hello? What the hell is happening? Oh, crap! -Good evening. -Evening. Sorry to bother you, but my telephone went out. May I use yours to report the outage? Go ahead. Thanks. Over here. Hello? Yes, I'm calling because my phone has gone out. No dial tone, exactly. Of course. It's 04 76… 94 08 21. Sandrine Dumez, yes. MAY 2000 How long? Okay. Thank you, goodbye. Is that your wife? Yes. What did they say? They will do what they can, they don't know how long. Pre-made administrative sentences. Smells good, what is it? Lamb stew. It looks very, very good. I know my stuff. So? It's good. I'm gonna go back. I was about to open some canned food. Excuse me. It'll last for eight days… Okay, I'm going. Enjoy your meal. Welcome to Heaven Balconies. I am not here to answer. But if you want to come enjoy the nature here, In a beautiful location leave your contact information. After the beep, go ahead. Sandrine? It's Mom. I just wanted to hear from you. Okay, call me back. I'd like that. Bye now. Tuesday, 4:28 p.m. It must be that. Sir? Hello, sir. I am looking for a young woman, Sandrine Dumez. You are? A friend. Gérard Chauvin. What do you want from Ms. Dumez? To visit her. Magnificent. This suits you very well. -Do we kiss? -If you want. The old man on the farm showed me the way. He didn't talk much. I didn't dare ask him who he was. You did well. How did you manage to find me? Well, your mother liked me. She gave me the information a while ago. I just organized an internship in Grenoble. So I thought on my way back to Paris, why not stop by and say hi. It's been a while. -I'm not bothering you, I hope? -No. You look great. I can't tell if you've lost or gained weight, but you look good. Mouchette, come here! What are you doing! Sorry. Alright, I'll bring the herd back. Yes. Would it bother you if I came with you to the farm? Maybe you can come back with me? -No, no, no. -They can… I'll stay with my animals, you never know. Okay… -I can come? -If you want. Come, let's go! Go ahead. Pass it out. -Like this, right? -Yes. I believe this one likes me. Oh, really? Actually, one is being attacked by the rest. -Oh, that's okay. -No? Go on, give it to them. See, it's her. Look, she's back. The others are mean to her. Sincerely, you left everything… went back to school, bought a farm with goats in the mountain… I never thought you'd do that. I had been thinking about it for years. But given what was said when we were last together, you were unlikely to notice. Yes… Well now, I notice. How are you living? How? Very well. I mean, do you live alone? Yes, alone. Since you left Paris… it's been… -You've had no… -What? And you? Nothing. I'm so happy to see you again. You are very beautiful. Thank you. You have not changed. Really? Right… What should we do now? Your coffee is as good as always. There… I'm gonna have to get going. I have an appointment in Paris at noon. What are you doing today? I have a group of horseback riders stopping by the lodge. I have to prepare their rooms. And I'm behind making the jams. I understand. You did well to come say hello. I had a great evening. Really. And a great night. I didn't sleep much, but I feel great. Get home safe. So… Let's not abuse good things. I think you are wrong. If you're ever in Paris… What did this guy look like? Nothing. Self-confident. With a wicked smile. Apparently, it works. He left early this morning. Yes, that's normal. Such a beautiful young woman… If I was 30 years younger… Me, I don't blame him. It looks like it's bothering you. Who, me? I don't give a rat's ass. VERCORS, LAND OF TRADITIONS She gave me this the other day. By the way, how is it going with the Parisian? It's going well. Hey, Adrien. Some say you're having a good time with her. Don't push me, guys. In your place, Adrien, I wouldn't be so proud. It's not pretty what you did. He's right, Adrien. You could have left your farm to the local peasants. Think of your friends, though, you never do. Friends? Yes. Did you say "friends"? When I had my hard time, up there with my stables… where were those friends? Uh? "Friends", you call yourselves. No one. I saw no one. You treated me like a leper. Don't mix everything up, Adrien. We didn't have anything to do with that. Now, with the Parisian on your pastures don't rely too much on the profession if you're in trouble, eh? Ah, yes, the profession. Apart from attacking prefectures and fast-food chains to make the evening news… what does the profession offer? The Parisian, as you say, don't worry about her… You won't see her on the evening news. While you are gesticulating with a silly tierce in hand… The Parisian is selling her goat cheese. On the Internet, in Germany. -You want some? -Yes, I'm hungry. I'll make an exception. -Slept well? -Yes, very well. So, have you thought about it? Why? Are you not better? No. My ass is so sore. Seriously, it's true. This is my first time horseback riding and I'm not used to it. So today, I will stay here. I'm going to read a book, just relax. If you want, take my horse. I don't know your horse. He's very kind. Also, you know your way around. It will be nice. -Yes, that's a good idea. -Alright, okay. Excuse me. Can you pass the jam please? Sorry to bother you, but I have a train for Grenoble this afternoon, I'm going to visit my grand-nephew. I will be back Friday in the morning. Okay. Want some coffee? Ah, no. They are forecasting a storm, I need to… to tidy the garden before I leave. Here you go. I had so much left over, and I don't like to throw any away… And since I don't have a dog… Okay, see you later. Excuse me. Was that your father? No, my father has a business in Montreuil. It was the farm worker. No, it's the previous owner. He still occupies the house, but won't be there soon. Really? But once he is gone, you will be on the farm alone? Yes, it was planned like that. I bought this as my own, not the old man with it… Direct, at happy hour. Well, listen, I tried to get more info… Have you been for a while? Fifteen minutes, no more. And what did you do for fifteen minutes? I slept, like you. It makes you sleepy watching someone else sleep. Did you come by yesterday? No. I went and fed your rabbits. And then I ran into Sandrine. We chatted and then, finally… She invited me to lunch, so… She's very busy right now, it's the heat season with the herd. She's waiting for you to come home to visit you. The owner of the car registered 733 NFC 38 is requested to move his vehicle which is in front of the ER. You couldn't help but blocking the ER with your car again? They will end up not allowing you in the building. For five days I've been stuck here, she could have… She could have taken two hours to come see me. Don't you think? I told her it wasn't right. She said she wasn't alone in not being right. Come on. My God, I know that I don't come often. To be completely honest, it bored me going to church. But now, inevitably, at my age with what has just happened I feel less proud. I'm afraid, my Lord. I am scared to death. Also, while on this subject, I wanted to ask for a favor. And so, I … I am in no particular hurry to join you. So, with your consent I would like a little delay. Because I would like to organize everything at the farm, especially with the kid. She doubts nothing, thinks she knows everything. She won't go very far, you understand. So I don't want to leave this way. My God… I'm not asking for twenty more years. But, you know… See what you can do, Lord. A high mountain chain separates the northern… Come in. This is where the tropical forest extends… There is no electrical current in the house, no heating, nothing. I don't understand, I checked everything. You still have electricity, can I connect to your meter? At least to heat my room. Well… The main issue is my meter is from 1967. He won't like it if you try and hack him. You'll have to call the power company. They will fix it. In the meantime, you can warm up here. I don't have the time. I have to turn off the water and drain, otherwise the pipes will blow. Thanks. With a quiet step, this spider moves slowly. Certain to take in his net with the prey it covets. Yes. -I'm not disturbing you? -No. May I come in? Yes. I still have no power and I can't reach the power company. I am not surprised. According to the radio, it's a heavy winter storm. They say all routes are blocked. Nobody can get up here because of the wind and snow drifts. It won't be fixed anytime soon. Don't you have a kerosene heater? Ah, well… Yes. I hadn't thought about that. Here, there's one up there. But I have no more oil. That's for sure. How am I going to make it through the night? Oh, listen… You can stay here. Tomorrow is another day. -In the house? -Do you have a better idea? You don't seem to know what a winter here is like yet. But where am I going to sleep? There's the old parents' room. Come see. I will show you. There, make yourself comfortable. Give me a hand. Are you sure that… What? Right. I'll grab some things in the lodge. I rarely eat something so good! -Ah yes. -What's in the sauce? You don't doubt a thing, do you? Do you think I'll give away my secrets so easily? When my mother passed away she left behind her cooking recipes… When you were with your wife, who was cooking? It was all me. She was not lacking in goodwill, but she couldn't cook very well. She had other skills. Very gentle. Which balanced out my personality. So you know it? I know very well that I'm hard to get along with. I never said otherwise. But she never complained. Thirty-five years of marriage. It's something, isn't it? Ten years ago, One morning, I found a cow, lying in the stable. Drooling badly. I called Meinard, the vet. That same evening, three military units… surrounded my farm. Worse than if I was a gangster. The prefect showed up here, in the kitchen. The prefect in person, can you imagine? He told us that… That it was the mad cow disease. Mad cow… We hear it all the time on the radio, but back then, I barely knew what it meant. Yeah. So they sprayed the whole barn. With a large fire in the yard to burn… ropes, straw, necklaces… Anything the cows could have touched. And then they took them all away. They took all of them in trucks. I even had to fight to stay with them. For 36 years, we got up every morning… to milk the cows. And then overnight, nothing. All in all, that was the hardest part. Émilie, she… She didn't say anything. She began… to let herself go. One morning, she couldn't get up. She never left her bed again. It's not even human how she suffered. Eat! It'll get cold. Okay, I'm going to bed. -Good night. -Good night. The barometer keeps falling. It's not going to get better. Do snow plows ever come through here? Oh, you know… It must be a huge mess down there. So, just the two of us here, it's not really a priority. Do you want a toast? Just one, because I need to tend to the goats. Yes, of course. May I come with you? I get really bored, you know. -Okay. -Good. I ended up getting through to the company about the electric failure. Really? And do you know what they found? No? Nothing. They said that the equipment here must be faulty. They have some nerve, haven't they? My equipment is new! Yep, that's the company for you. A nest of bureaucrats. As soon as there is a serious problem, it's a catastrophe. So, they prefer to tell you that they have nothing to do with it. But what am I going to do? Ah, well… we'll figure it out. I'm lucky you're here. Thank you. It's normal. Here… Help me. Slowly. Make more shallow peelings. You didn't do the war. What does it mean? I know what I'm saying. Tomorrow I will make us roast veal. -With a small green salad. -No, no. Surely not. It's not the right season. What do you mean it's not the right season? Salad is summer, not winter. We don't just eat anything whenever. Seasons aren't just for show. So if in farming, we don't even respect that, we might as well… Alright, what do we eat in winter? The endives. OK, then the endives. I don't have any. They don't last in the freezer very well. A roast veal without the greens, already it seems like the calf… What about the calf? What do you have against the calf? When I was little, my mother, every Wednesday, cooked me a slice of veal liver. "It's full of vitamins," she would say. It was torture. I hated it. She would make it marinated in margarine. In margarine? Never utter this word in front of a peasant who makes milk, it's terrible. You know what we used to call it back home, the margarine? Bull butter. Margarine… And since your health incident, have you changed your diet? Not at all. You think that the diet has an effect? It's the spirit. No annoyances, in a positive mood, then… it'll make up for itself. -If you say so. -Yes. Of course, I say so. Look what you did. I will be forced to peel your peels now. Huh? From France and Navarre But tell her either way That I love her Tell her if you may That I said hello and that's it Did I wake you up? I hope it wasn't too loud. It's Émilie's favorite song. A gift from Jean for one of our wedding anniversaries. A little too touchy for me. I liked it when she played the other side. I don't how to dance the waltz. You'll see, it's not too complicated. Just count to three and follow me. Huh? One, two, three. On an old carousel rotates the parade On a mournful melody On the one organ that trails The same wheezy tune Today the party Shines on the whole country In every household Happiness sings and love radiates The bird on the tree Hops in the branches In the blue sky The rooster of the church Spins around In the cheerful wind Under the tent The dance is starting already A couple jumps ahead... I shouldn't strain myself. You dance very well. Tell me, don't you we should fix the fence for the goats? Good idea, come with me. Yes, but I… I didn't take my nap! I'm going. See you later. Fucking power company. I brought you the album from the farm. There are pictures from my parents' time. It does not look the same. I will show you. You see? That was in 1941, for example. It looks nothing like it does today. In 1944, the Germans burned all the isolated farms… who could hide fighters. We were able to save some animals and some furniture. But not much. Why didn't you rebuild it closer to the village? For what reason? We have always been here. And here, that's you? You were better off without the beard. Émilie liked a smooth face. I was clean shaven at the time. Here, want to see the lodging when there were still cows? See? This is when my father planted the pear tree, the day I was born. In the orchard. And this is the cherry tree we planted for my wedding. If you have kids, plant fruit trees. They will think of you when eating the fruits. Here, it's Émilie. She looks like she was pregnant, no? Yes… He did not live. I'll have to take one of you pictured on the bench. Later I… I'll give you the album. And you will continue it, and adding the photos you want. And you, no pictures of your parents? We didn't take many pictures at home. My parents divorced when I was little. My mother never remarried and my father… I stayed with my mother, and we never took any photos. Are you an only child? So you must be so precious to your mother. She might even suffer not seeing you enough. At least you check in with her? A little. Not often enough. Here already? What's wrong? This is the time we agreed on. That weather vane is creaky, should I oil it? Don't, or we won't know what the weather will be like. When it squeaks like that, it means it's going to rain, or snow every time. Shall we taste my pear brandy? Go slowly with the pear. I don't want to get too drunk. Jean takes me to town. I have to go back to the hospital for my record. Blood test, stress test, or so they say… And a bunch of other stuff. Not even good enough to tell me how long I have. I told him to use the time wisely with his grand-nephew. It would be time for you to get used to your new home. By September… Take care of yourself, I'll tend to the rabbits. Well, now, we have to go. No! Come here, you. Come on, Mouchette. We can't spend all night. Come on, Mouchette. Come on, push. Come on, push! Come on! Go on. Come on, go ahead. Fuck, you're kidding me… Come on, Mouchette. Give me your second one, come on. Come on, push! Come on, keep going. Come on. Oh fuck! Piece of shit… Fucking… No… Fucking hell! Fucking hell! You know, the one that makes you cry You were always going too far Like these old Italian movie stars Do that old melodrama again With your disarming gaze These mountains for nothing much Turns out I liked them as such Just a big well... I am happy to see you. Come in. How did it go at the hospital? Well… They treated me as if I were a kid. And then they forbid from eating most foods. I don't even have the right to drink coffee anymore. I brought the tractor back. I parked it under the shed. I was looking for the power station. And then… The power station! No, but do you realize? You could have been trapped there, for God's sakes! Yes, I shouldn't have. I did something stupid. Yes, you did something stupid. I have to pack my suitcase now and put a bunch of stuff away. See you later. See you later. Sugar? Yes. He hardly ever leaves his home anymore, I don't know what's wrong. It's not like what it used to be. He is depressed. You have to understand. At the hospital, they said he wouldn't make it this year, if he didn't take care of himself. I was there when the doctor yelled at him. And then they said he needed to eat margarine, he was furious. I shouldn't have taken this farm, it's too far away from everything. Winter, all alone here, I will go mad. I even have days where I feel I am not made for this job. Well then… I thought you would be more cheerful. I guess not… You've hit a rough spot, that's all. It happens to everyone. I will call Stéphane back from the ministry. Maybe I can go and find a farm more… A farm that what? Being a peasant is hard everywhere. What did you think? Or you have 400 hectares of wheat in Beauce, but it's still harder farming. Go on vacation and clear your head. That's what I did when things got out of hand. Holidays. Don't you think about it? And then, what about the animals? I called Stéphane, from the ministry. There is a young person in training who will take care of the goats. It won't change anything for you. If you go back to Paris, you won't come back. -Are you not gonna let me go? -I did not say that! I just need to take a breather. Do you want me to tell you? I am not surprised. As soon as I saw you, I knew you wouldn't hold out. No matter how much we teach you in schools, it's not a woman's job. Working the land… It takes courage, muscle strength. Consistency. You women, you change mood like you change your clothes. All these theories, modernism, feminism… all that is talk. If nature made women different… it's that they're different. You really are bitter and narrow-minded. You didn't deserve my farm. Well fine, then keep it. I'm out of here. You know what? You really are an old jerk. -Hello, Miss. -Hello, sir. Come on, let's go. -Hello, Mom. -Hello, my darling. Let me. There were changes here. Yes, I had closets put it, it's more convenient. How are you? The same. Good. I let a young student take my place at the farm. You know, milking in the morning, milking in the evening. It's not complicated. And he has my cellphone just in case. You're on top of it. Your laundry is not really dry. Yes, I know. We'll put near the boiler and it will quickly be dry. Yet they had announced sunny weather for the afternoon. Say, do you have any photos of your cottage? I don't even know what your house looks like. No, not here. Are you happy at least? Sometimes, yes. -Do you remember Rosine? -Yes, why? I invited her to dinner tomorrow night. I will make calf's liver. It won't hurt. If it wasn't for Rosine and the calf liver, you wouldn't have called. You're exaggerating. I would have called you anyway. I wanted to have dinner with you. Between friends. And your lodging, your farm, everything, how is it going? It's okay. It's not always easy. But hey, overall, it's good. I'm disappointed, your mother didn't tell me that you were coming back to Paris. I'm not coming back to Paris. I'm on vacation for a few days, that's all. It's not like it used to be here. It's not like when we used to come. -Do you remember? -Yes. So what do we do now? I'm going home, I'm exhausted. I'll come with you. Okay. You're asleep? You know, when I came this summer… There wasn't really an internship in Grenoble. I came just for you. Don't worry. Don't worry, it'll be fine. You know your deal, you won't get screwed by beginners. They are all very beginners. I present to you Sandrine Dumez, who will be your trainer for the last two days of the internship. Mr. Lecoz, had to take time off for personal reasons. Listen, I suggest you start without further delay. -See you tonight. -See you tonight. If I'm going on the main page… Let's take an example, if I enter "John and Smith". The computer will search the two keywords within ten adjacent words. That is, if they are distant eight words or less. Excuse me, I'm sorry. Hello? This is her. How many goats are there on the ground? Fuck. It's a tympanite. Tympanite! Didn't they teach you that at school? No, don't call the vet, it will cost more than the animals. You gave them too much alfalfa at once, they will die from asphyxiation! Alright, go in the cheese factory. You will take a bottle where I wrote "tympanite-proof". And you are going to give them some two tablespoons in the mouth. And hurry, it is seriously urgent. Call me back to keep me posted. Thanks. Idiot. Excuse me. Good. Where was I? Adrien? I'm at my end, Lord. I don't want to see anyone anymore. I feel empty. I lost her, damn it. I screwed up by not leaving my door open for her. I should have talked to her more and listened more. Instead of that… I found a reason to yell at her, and so… I really have been a jerk, all the way to the end. Now, it's no longer useful. Her… She could have kept it on in my place. But it was too good to be true. I didn't deserve that kid.. And then that's all. Spring will be late, but for me, it will be winter every day now… I think the best thing… would be for you to come get me in my bed. Quietly, smoothly, in my sleep. If you could spare me what Émilie suffered. I don't have her courage. I know very well that there is no way to choose how we go… I'm waiting for you. Well, it'll take a while. Two interns came to see me. -This afternoon, during a break. -And? They wanted to know if it was you who taught the level two internship. Wait, Gérard. Let it be clear, I helped you out two days, no more. Okay? That's what I said. My sister gave me some keys to her villa in Normandy. To watch the horses. Fancy a walk on the beach? What will the weather be like? Very good. Excuse me. Hello? Ah, it's you. How are the goats? When did that happen? Come on, Mouchette! On an old carousel rotates the parade On a mournful melody On the one organ that trails The same wheezy tune Today the party Shines on the whole country In every household Happiness sings and love radiates The bird on the tree Hops in the branches In the blue sky The rooster of the church Spins around the cheerful wind Under the tent The dance is starting already A couple jumps ahead speaking softly Another approaches quietly And I feel your arm on mine gently Come, come, sing, sing Turn, turn, swing, swing Dreams of pleasure at the ball of desire Sway, sway, tipsy, tipsy, Sway, sway, clear and airy, Sighs and kisses Of captivated hearts The bird on the tree Hops in the branches In the blue sky The rooster of the church Spins around the cheerful wind Under the tent The dance is starting already A couple jumps ahead speaking softly Another approaches quietly And I feel your arm on mine gently Come, come, sing, sing Turn, turn, swing, swing Dreams of pleasure at the ball of desire Sway, sway, tipsy, tipsy, Sway, sway, clear and airy, Sighs and kisses Of captivated hearts On a lovely Sunday that white dress Twirls beautifully The arm brushing past Rests upon the shoulder With a beating heart In that euphoria Of a slightly mad dream In the humble party Decorated simply Let's keep that image forever Memories too short Of a day filled with love A day filled with love Subtitle translation by: Matthew Saucier, Coline Gentilleau
