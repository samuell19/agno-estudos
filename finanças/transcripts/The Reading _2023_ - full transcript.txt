Start from the beginning for us. Okay. Mommy, Mommy, Mommy! Hey, my baby! Hi, my sweet sugar. I'm gonna get you. Oh, them kisses so good. Them kisses! What you gonna do about it? Who's Mommy's favorite Kyren in the world? Me! Who's my favorite Kyren? Okay, go back upstairs and Mommy's gonna come up and run your bath water, okay? Okay. Go ahead. Well listen, now. What am I supposed to do with all this love? Huh? All this love. Oh! How my baby doing? Which one of us do you love the most? Oh, now Kendall. You know which one I love the most? Come close, cause I gotta tell you. I love the one the most... who's room is clean right now. Mom! Yes. Yes! Pinky bear swear. You ready for dinner? Yeah. Okay. Where's Daddy? Hers or yours? Ew! Gross! Well, hello there. Hers now. Mine later. How you doing? Never better than getting home to you. Okay, sweet talker. Okay. You have a lot more work to do. Well, I have a few things I need to finish up, but... I shouldn't be long. Well get finished... So you'll be there and ready for dinner. I got a little something for you later. Go get it done. Uh huh. I see you've been working out. I like it! Yeah. Dunk! Dunk dunk. Alexa, turn down. Alexa, turn up. Aaaah! I woke up some time later... to nothing. And I think about that moment almost every day. Emma, what you've been through is unimaginable. You being able to speak and to write about it... is incredible. I don't want people... to see me as a victim. I just don't want the death of my family... to fade away. Emma, thank you so much for coming today. I wish I had more time to dive in deep with you. We'll have you back soon. The brave Emma Leeden, ladies and gentlemen. And get her book, The Invasion. She feels peaceful. She used to worry about you a lot, didn't she? Yeah. She always wanted me to do more in college than just, you know, party. Actually get an education. She's very proud of you. She is? Yes. I have to close the door now. Bye, mom. Johnny. Yeah? Your mom has a question and a request, but... I think the door is closing. Wait, please find out what it is. I'm trying. She asked if you can wire money out of your trust fund to the Kids for Kids Organization. I mean, yeah, I thought she didn't want me to touch it until after college. She says, Don't ask any- She says, Don't ask any- Mom? Mom, you there? She is. She says, Don't question her. Yeah, of course. Anything you want. Anything else? Oh no. Thank you. We're good. You want something? No. What are you thinking? You know what I'm thinking. I told you. I don't want to do this anymore. So what are you going to do, quit? Okay. Think about it. How you gonna pay for school next year, if we stop now? You gonna get a job? You know your school schedule wouldn't allow it. And what about Randy and Jess? What about your mom? Don't bring my mother into this. How can I not, Sky? Y'all are literally waiting for the landlord to come down when they feel like it to put you out. Look. I get it. Fuck us. Okay? But what about her? It's not fuck y'all? It's just... Nothing. What is it you're not telling me? Hm? You can just say it. I don't read minds. What's really up? You remember that guy, Johnny? Yeah, the white boy from the last reading. What about him? His mom came so close to touching me. And I tried my hardest to push her back. And I tried my hardest to push her back. But she was so angry. And so strong. I'm sorry. I mean, everything was just flowing so smoothly I... I mean you didn't say anything, so I... But what were you scared for? I mean, you don't even know what happens when they touch you. They never touched you, right? Fuck... Sky! When I was a kid. What happens when they touch you? They possess you. Mama! I'm in my room. Ah! Martha's Vineyards! Dumb asses. Hey, Mama. Hey, baby. How was class? You know. Same old. Still teaching you shit you already know. Pretty much. You just a head smarter than the bunch. That's all. I was like that. You know you got that brain of yours from me, right? Yeah, I know. Kazakhstan! Untapped jewel. 18 million population. Hey, did you get that money I left you? Yeah. Speaking of that, where'd you get that money from? Now I don't want you doing nothing you don't need to be doing to get in trouble now, Skeeter. No, ma'am. I got these bills. They're not yours, you hear me? Now, I need you to concentrate on your schooling. Mama, no. It's just a little part time work I'm doing. Well, keep your money! I got these bills. Now. I need you to just finish school. Become that doctor, and come back and get your old mama. Until then, don't worry about these bills. I got them. I got a friend come over tonight. Bring me some money. A friend? Are they um... coming over to just drop off money and leave? What you just say? Now I need you to finish your schooling. And I will take care of these bills. You hear me? Cats! Knew that shit. Sky-Ry! Hey. Hey, Jessie. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Randy's not with you? Oh, yeah. He's outside parking. I saw Greg parking too. You and Greg didn't ride together? No. I took the Zip. The Zip? You and Greg okay? Yeah, we're fine. Okay. So what's up? Well, I wanted to talk to you first before we all came together as a group. Okay? What's up? Something wrong? No. Nothing's wrong. I feel like I owe you a heads up. Oh, well. You're a little too late for that. Greg already spilled it. He did? Yeah. Why you acting like it's a bad thing? I just didn't know how you react. What do you mean, how I'd react? How do I always react to new marks? What did you just say? Our new mark, Emma Leeden. She's an author. Her sister-in-law, Ashley, is wanting to do a reading for her. The great thing is they think Sky's a fraud, so they don't really care. What's the catch? There isn't one. See, Ashley is also her PR and they think that this will help sell her book. Easy Money. Now Emma will be wanting to talk to her family. Her husband and two children were killed in a home invasion about two years ago. Oh, my God. Yeah. The husband, Matthew, Leeden. He sells diamonds or some shit. They came in to get the diamonds at the house that he lives in. They killed him and the kids. Emma, the wife, barely survived. Barely? Like, how barely? I mean, they beat her, stabbed her, and cut off one of her fingers, barely barely. Holy shit. Yo! Now this is a whole new level. Like, we've dealt with people that have lost loved ones to, like, diabetes and cancer or old age or some shit. But this shit? Murder? She probably unstable her damn self, let alone some fucking ghost. Yeah, I figured that. They're paying 20 grand. - 20 what? - Whoa! Yeah. That's five K each. And if the pay is 20, we can get a hundred K if we play it right. Ooh, hundred K! Yeah, she's loaded. Plus, after this, we can put this online and everybody would be paying as much. Well. I'm in. Yeah. Hell, yeah. Me too. But as y'all know, it's not on us. It's on you, Sky. Sky. Sky! Sky! Sky-Ry. What you do? Sky, hold up a sec. Sky, hold up. Could you just listen to me for a sec? Listen to you? I did. I just did. I listened to you set me up to be the let down. The bad guy in front of our friends. I listened to you talk, but obviously you didn't hear shit I had to say this morning. Sky, it was not even like that. Then how is it? I told you I was scared, and you go find another gig? Hey, listen, it wasn't- Then you push us going public after I told you I didn't want my mother finding out. So explain to me how it is then. If you just listen to me, I'm trying to explain to you that that's why I called the meeting. Okay? So we can talk about your feelings and... and figure it out. But... I mean, I got this call about this Emma lady, and they they started talking about 20 grand. That's 20 K, Sky. And that bought you off? 20 grand is how much my fear is worth to you? Cause that's what it is. Fear. I'm scared. Sky... I know. But we talking about a hundred K. They think it's fake anyway! But it's not! It's real. It... is real. That ain't it. That ain't it. That ain't it. I know why wolves don't get caught. It's cause they dressed like sheep. Hey, what's up? I'll do it. Okay. I'll set it up. Hand me that. Thank you. Hey, Sky. Can I talk to you for a second? Look, Sky, I... I know that I didn't set this up the way that I should've, but, I mean, this shit just seemed so perfect. I mean, it practically fell in our laps. I get it. And I do understand what you were trying to do, but you failed... terribly. You forgive me? Yes. But look, everybody got to find their own way after this. This is it. Okay. Okay? I get it. I'm serious. Okay. Yoo hoo. Look. She may forgive you, but I don't. So... you better hope... this goes as smooth as you think it's going to go. Because if it doesn't, We're... gonna have a problem. Okay, buddy? Yeah. Good talk. Hello. Hello. Welcome. Come in. How you doing? Hey. Uh, Ms. Ashley? Um, Gregory? Yeah. Nice to meet you. This is Randy. They'll be the ones assisting today. And... this is Sky. Nice to meet you all. Ashley Leeden. Emma! Honey! Yeah? Your guests are here, honey. Okay, I'm coming. Randy, what's wrong? This is, like, the only place that I get any service, if I move even a little bit, I get nothing. I don't think we're going to be able to upload while we're here. Yeah, this house is probably in a dead zone. What, you mean like a supernatural dead zone? No. I mean, like the Internet is dead in this house. Yeah, right. Emma. This is Gregory. This is the young man we spoke to on the phone. Hello. And this is his team. Hi. Emma, this is Sky. Sky's the one doing your reading today. Sky. I've heard some amazing yet hard to believe things about you. So I'm I'm pleased to meet you, Sky. Thank you. And I hope I can help you in some way today. Well, um... What do you need from me? Just a room for them to set up, and... maybe a little look around, if that's okay? Sure, sure. You guys can use the dining room and feel free to move things around if you need to. And Ash, if you wouldn't mind if you could go and finish the refreshments... refreshments for me. Okay? Sure. Okay. Jessie, is it? Yes, ma'am. Can you assist me, hun? Sure. Come on. Sky, I'm gonna took you on a tour. Hey. Are you good with this? Yeah. It'll help. Whose room was this? This was Kendall's room. Kyren's room is down there. He was five. May I? Yeah. Yeah. Most things in the house, I really didn't touch. And... I... try not to come up here too much. I know you've heard this before, but I'm truly sorry. I don't know what I would do if I lost my family like that. Me either. My kids. You know? I'm so sorry. My babies. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Are you okay? You would think it would get easier having these conversations. Okay. Okay. I got cameras in and out, all around. I got hammer glass for the windows with metal inner panels and locks. Steel reenforced oak front door. I even got a damn gun that I don't know how to use. That sounds silly. Cause anything can still happen. But I need as much fake protection around me just so I can function every day. Wi-Fi connection still isn't working. We're going to have to record straight to hard drive. This house kills the Wi-Fi. I'll get you a copy of the recording before we go. Just as long as we get it recorded. I want what I paid for. I want what I paid for. Ashley! What? Don't be rude. Okay. You ready? Yeah. You sure, Sky? Because we really ain't got to do this. Jesse. I'm sure. Okay. We're all set then. I need you to just relax. I need you to clear your mind of anything not in this moment, of anything that takes you away from this room. I need you to just be here. Take deep breaths with me. You ready? In. Out. In. Out. In. Out. Emma. Say their names and repeat. Okay. Matthew. Kyren. Kendall Again. Matthew. Kyren. Kendall. Kendall. Wait! Oh shit. That's interesting. I heard footsteps. How did you do that? Your favorite color is teal. Not green. Not blue, but specifically teal. You're a Scorpio. You loved to cook for your family. Seafood. Crawfish. You would season them so well. That when you ate them, your fingers burned. That's every Black person in America. Tell us something we don't know. Hey. Ok. Come on now. I'm sorry. Go on. This feels different. What does? Kyren loved dressing himself. He had so much energy. He used to argue with you about wearing his rain boots on sunny days. You're right. How do you How do you- Kendall was different. She was to herself. She was more like her dad, but really girly. She loved her mommy. She knew mommy gave her and Kyren anything to make them happy. She would wear dresses she hated just for you. She used to imitate you perming your hair because you forbid her to do hers. She loved Kyren, but she hated she had to babysit him all the time. You would always reward her for being a great big sister, And you would promise her things if she did what you asked. And you sealed it with... a pinky bear swear. Could... could you excuse me for a second? This is... this is too much. Em. You're good. Really good. Let me get her back. How you... How you feeling? I'm Okay. What did you mean by it feels different? It just felt weird. Weird, how? It felt like something was suffocating already around the door. We talk an angry, suffocating? Yes. Aye, this shit don't feel right, yo. That, I can agree on. I think we need to wrap this up. Agreed. Let's cut this short. Come on. No. Sky. Babe, come on. No! We do this for money all the time. but Did you hear what happened to her? Did you see her? If it had happened to one of y'all? Wouldn't you want to hear from them? To know if they're okay? I would be the lowest piece of shit human to let her keep that last memory when I know I could bring her some type of peace. Sky... You said it yourself. You felt something. What was that? I don't know what that was. But we will face it, finish it, and be done with this shit. It'll be okay. Emma, you okay? What's going on? Huh? Okay. So I may have told them just a few things about your family, just to make it look a little more real on camera. Ashley, are you serious? How was I supposed to know she would do the knee jerk, creepy shit? Well, you should've let me know. That dug up a lot for me. I'm sorry. What else do I need to be prepared for? Honestly, that's it. I don't even remember telling her half that shit. But it was probably obvious by the tour you gave her. Are you sure? Yeah. I'm actually really curious to see what she comes up with. She's out of material. Well, I'm not. Are you okay? I am. Are you ready to continue? I'd like to fully connect now. You didn't fully connect the last time? What was that? Your intro? May I? You may. Repeat their names... slowly. Matthew. Kyren. Kendall. Again. Matthew. Kyren. Kendall. Jessie! No, it's... it's hiked. It's never been this high. - It's never been this high. - Sky baby, it's okay. It's never been this high. Sky. She's burning up. She's burning up! Get the ice. Come on. She's burning up! I got it. Get the ice. Sky? Greg? Look. What do we do? The fuck. Is she gonna... Is she gonna... Hey! Shh! Hey, turn down the monitor. What is that? That sounds like typing coming from Matthew's office. That's creepy. How did you do- Paul! I need this? You hear me? You said it would be six months before we see a return. It's been two years. This is killing me, Paul. If something doesn't happen soon, I won't make it out of this quarter. Else? What do you mean else? This is it. This is everything. Why would I have anything else prepared for something my friend said was a for sure thing? I don't need that unicorn shit, Paul. I need results. Yes, I hear you. But I heard this from you before. A shell of a woman Living but not alive. A shell of a woman What is this? What is this? without a heart I can't survive. I never spoke about this song. How does she know this song, Ashley? I didn't know anything about this song. What song is this? Hey, are you up? What are you doing? LOL My mom's making me go to the fundraiser at school tomorrow. Let's just stop this, Ashley. Why would you do this? How? How could you do this? I didn't know anything about this. Hey! Can you stop? Hey! Hey, this is not how this works. Do not touch her. Well, then make her stop. Sad face emoji. Stop her! We can't. This has never happened before. Ashley, I want you to stop her. Stop her! Can you stop, please!? Thank you! I done came down. I done came far. I'ma be driving in my candy painted car. Hey, Mommy. What you doing? Kyren? N... no. No. This is too much. We need to cut this. - This is too much. - This is too much. We need to cut this. Y'all will get what I promised I'd pay you. Let's just wrap it. Let's just wrap it. Let's just wrap it. Sky's still connected. Sky. Sky, baby. What's happening to her? Sky, baby. I got it. She's so hot. 180 I got it. Temp. You ok? Temp. We gotta snap her out of it. - No, no, Greg! No. - Hey! Come out of it. We gotta snap her out of it. Don't shake her. We gotta snap her out of it. I don't know what I would do to her. Okay, so what do we do? I don't know! I don't know. It just... It can't take this. Hey, baby. Her body can't take this. You know what? You know what, Greg? This is your fault. My fault? Yes. Sky had that meeting to talk about quitting. But you didn't do that, did you? Jessie, this isn't the time or the place. You're right. This is a fucked up time and a fucked up place that we're in because of you! Me!? - Guys. - Yes, you! Me!? I didn't even know this was going to happen! Well, maybe she did! Maybe she knew, and that's why she was scared. But no! You wanted to get a hundred K out of this lady, And you didn't care what any of us said in order to get it. Now did you? Oh, come on now. In order to get it. Now did you? This isn't just on me! You didn't give us a chance to say anything, Greg! You didn't give us a chance! She told me on the way here that she was scared. Exactly! Okay? You had a chance to back out, and you didn't! Get out of my face! Hey, it doesn't matter anymore. What matters is Sky. Now what the fuck do we do!? Sky, baby baby, you ok? - Hey! Hey hey hey-hey. - W-wait! Hey. Hey, baby. - Look at me. - Hey, you ok? Let me get your pulse. What happened? Whaty. W-whappened? What's wrong? aby. - Look at me. - Hey, you ok? What does she see? She locked us in. No, that's not what she's doing. Aye, lady! You need to open the doors. Calm down. That is not what she's doing. You calm down. Don't raise your voice at me little girl! You need to calm down! You're making the situation worse. I'm making the situation worse? You need to address the lady that just locked the fucking door! Jesse. What!? Be cool. Miss Leeden. Look, we apologize. You need to unlock these doors so we can be on our way. Now, we haven't taken any money, so there's no harm done here. Look, lady, I said as nicely as I possibly can. Emma! They're just kids! The money isn't worth it. Okay. Miss Leeden... We didn't take any money. And we're not going to say anything. Can you just please open the doors... so we can get him some help. Miss Leeden. Open the doors, please. Boogieman! That's funny as shit to me. Huh? Okay. Go on tell your friends why they can't leave. Because... she killed... her family. You did it? Ah! Aah. Shit! Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on, stay strong. Stay strong. I did. They're bulletproof, y'all. They're what? I need you to do me a favor. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. I need you to tell the family that I said hello. Everybody hide. Now. God damn it. Any luck? No, they're locked. Shit. I think we're trapped in here. Wait. - What? - Hide. Hide. Where? Here. In here. Come here, come here. Squeeze in here. Come on. Come on. Just stay right there. Randy, what are you gonna do? Just stay in here. Come on, get in there. Come on. Randy, just get in here. You know, I can't fit in there! Randy! Just stay here! I'll be right back, okay? Just stay there. Children... Didn't your mommy tell you not to play in the kitchen? There's so many things that can hurt you in here. Jessie? You ok? Yeah Where is she? I don't know. I'll check it out. Randy? Did you look yet? I'm working on it. Ok, ok. I think she went upstairs. I know. Oh, shit. Oh, baby. Oh. You know what? I'm not gonna shoot you. I am not gonna shoot you, baby. Because you don't deserve to die like that. You don't deserve to die like that. And I don't wanna run out of my bullets. How is it? I don't know. It's not bleeding a lot. Here. Keep pressure on it. Ok. Do I need to- Shh! Sky. What you see? Nothing yet. Do you see her? No. Shit. That shot we heard. Sky, come on. That shot... Do you think it was Jess? Or Randy? Sky. What if they're dead or hurt somewhere? What if they're dead? Listen. Listen. They're okay. They're probably just... trying to figure a way out, just like we are. This is my fault. Okay? I'm going to get us out of here. I promise. Okay? Okay. Shit! Sky. Sky, come on! Sky. Sky, come on. Let's go! Sky. Sky, come on. Let's go! Please, please. Please, please. Come on, come on. Fuck! Fuck! This is, like, the only place that I get any service? If I move even a little bit. I get nothing. Shit! Ok. Alright. Okay. I swear, it's like this bitch is everywhere. Why would she kill her children? Look, Sky. Sky. This bitch is crazy. Okay? She been limping since we got here. Did you see her bolt up on them stairs? Her speech changed. Okay? So what we need to do is put all of our energy... into getting the fuck out of here. Ok? Ok. Ok. You're right. Um... Maybe we can get a signal closer to the front door. Or somewhere else in this house. I mean, she has to get calls at some point, right? The only problem is... is finding it. And before she finds us. One, two Emma's coming for you. Three four Emma locked all the doors. Five, six, Emma's gonna stay rich. Seven, eight, Emma sealed your fate. Nine, ten, Emma's gonna kill you and your... friends. Yes! Yes. Sky, come here. Come here. What is it? That? You see? Yeah. Okay. Ok, look. This the plan. I'm gonna distract her, okay? And I want you to run as cranked as you can, and get his attention, okay? Just come with me. That's not going to work. Okay? Okay. It's the only thing that I can think of. But we have to do it now. Okay? Okay. Hey. It's gonna work. Okay. Okay? Okay. Okay. And when I run out that door, wait 5 seconds. When you see an opening, go. Okay. Okay? Mmhmm. Ready? Yes. One. Two. Three. Aah! Bitch, I'm here! What's up? I'm here! Sky! Sky. Oh, I thought you were- I know. I know. I thought I was too. I'm okay. And you're okay. Okay? Okay. Where's Randy? She killed him? Nooo. Nooo. I know. Hey. Hey now, listen to me. Don't worry about that right now. Okay? Okay. We have to go. Okay. Ok, Sky, let's go. We have to go. What are we waiting for? That. Come on. Heeeelp! Help us out! Help us!

Greg, run! Come on, please. Come on! Go! I got to give it to you God damn kids. Cause y'all gon make old Emma work for the kill. And I don't mind a fucking challenge. I can't stand you young bitches now, always crying over some shit. It's too hard! I don't know. Oh bitch! Stop complaining all the motherfucking time! And you know what? Let me be honest. Let me be fucking honest. I would've probably let you go, and just paid you off had one of you came. Cause it would've been your word against old Emma. Against old E-E-E-E-Emma. Who do you think they gonna believe? Who do you think they gonna understand more? You little young motherfuckers gon come up, trying to run up on Emma. And made me get shit all over my God damn dress! This one of my favorite motherfucking dresses! Then y'all gon come up in here talking about we a team. We a team! Fuck some team, because team means loyalty. And when the team come together, the team got to die together! I know... y'all got questions. Because I would too. If I came with five motherfuckers... and two is no longer with us, I would want to know some things, too. And I want you to ask... your questions. When, where, why, what? Ain't that the shit they taught us? When, where, why, what? And I know y'all saying... how? That's where you fucked up, right now. You're not in the W's. Y'all want to know how... can we... break out this house? Answer. You can not... break out the house. You can't... get out of here. Bitch, you fucking crazy! No, no, no, no, no... no, no, no! Not at all. I am very sane and calculated. How else would I have been able to plan my husband's death so well? You think I'd be able to keep up this facade for so long? Yes! Yes, bitch, that's awful. You know what? I feel sorry for you. Huh? Because you've been hurt and it broke you. Whatever happened to you? I'm sorry, but you've done a horrible thing. Yeah. I don't know who hurt you. Maybe it was your mother. Your father? Maybe it was even your husband. But I know... I know it wasn't your children! Do you know how scared they were? How confused they were? As you looked them in the eyes and you let them see the one person they loved the most suck the life out of them. Kendall was so hurt. So confused. Kyren actually accepted it. He thought he got in trouble... for cursing. He died loving you! It wasn't his fault, Emma. It wasn't their pain to bare! Oh, my Kendall. Oh my beautiful Kendall. Shit. Kyren. My little man. What did I do? It wasn't my baby's price to pay. Girl, fuck them kids and fuck you too. Cause I didn't want the kids in the first fucking place. He wanted them God damn kids. I gave his ass my life, my dreams, my youth. I gave that motherfucker everything! For the promise of this luxurious lifestyle. And aren't you supposed to keep a fucking promise! You keep your word! You know? He didn't keep his promise. And we were going broke! And I'm not talking about the kind of broke when you can't go to the Bahamas for the summertime vacation. I'm talking about the fucking kind of broke where my goddamn address gotta change. I go from living in the neighborhood... back to the fucking hood! Emma was not going back to the fucking hood! All this for money? Well when you say it like that... you make it sound like I'm a monster, like it's so horrible. Plus, the kids was not in the plan. Shit! But who? Who, I ask you? Who wants to be a single mother? I know I damn sure don't. Money isn't everything. I'd rather be poor with the ones I love, than rich... and alone! That's some silly shit I knew you would say. Young and dumb. Love and loyalty. But one day you will realize... One day your young ass gonna realize... Wait. I never leave that door open like that. Get off my dress. You ain't so tough now, are you? Smart ass. Shit! Shit! I know. Hey. It's okay. It's okay. Hey okay. Hey. Hey. Okay. We go to move, Sky. Okay? You okay? Alright. Let's go. Okay? Shh. Come on now. Come on. Okay? We gonna get out of here. It's okay. I know, I know. Hey hey! Hey. What are you doing? She's going to kill us. She's really going to kill us. No no no. We got too much to do. We are not dying here. You hear me? We are not dying here. Okay? Know what, Sky? Fuck that! There's two of us and one of her. And all she got is a knife now. A fucking knife! We done fought bitches in the hood with razor blades and shit. We may get cut a little bit but... it's cool. No. This is her territory. She know this house too well. Exactly. And if we don't do this, she is going to bump us off one by one. She's been doing-Hey hey. So let's go out there and break it to this bitch. What about the code? Then we beat the code out her ass. Or the mail gotta come around again, or whatever. Okay. Okay? Yeah. Hey. Let's go beat this bitch ass. Find some long sleave stuff. So we can take some cuts. Yeah, this'll work. Ok. Alright. Okay. Ready? What? What!? I love you, girl. Sky-ry, come here. Hey. Hey. If I die, bitch, you better come visit me. No. We are not dying. Like you said, we gonna beat this bitch ass, right? Right. So let's go beat this bitch ass, okay? Okay. Okay. Alright. I love you. Are you waiting on something? Yeah. Well, actually, no. Because this is the only place in the house... that gets service. So I decided that instead of playing... this whole cat and mouse game, with you two cent half hoes... I was just gona wait... for y'all to come to me. You think this is a game? You think killing my friends is playful? Bitch, is that my sweater? You really think you have this all figured out, don't you? See, even if you kill us and get away with it, you'll still have to pay for what you've done... in this life or the next. That is good, bitch. That is good. That is good! And if Emma believed in that Christian shit, I'd be sca-ooo-oo-hoo. The next life. But we fucking with this life. Mm-hmm. And see, you talking about am I playing a game. Yes! I like it. This fucking game is so fucking fun. You're not having fun? I can't stand a bitch who come over my house and don't have fun. See that's why I'm fucking irritated, cause the game is weak. See I know the tricks you and this little bitch trying to pull. You get her attention on you, bitch, and then... I can try to get away. Not quite. You smart bitch. Let go and let God. Let go... Let go... and let God. Let go! And let God! Yeah. Yeah. Mmm. Let Go! Let God! Let God! Let God! Now... it's just me and you. Shit! Bitch go? The fuck is wrong with you? You want to know something funny? You'll probably get away with this. You think? Yeah. You'll probably go on and live a very very lonely life. Take great vacations. See some wonderful places. And you'll have nobody to share it with. Aw. You'll be so alone. I'm good... with a rich... and lonely life. Oh! It's empty bitch. Boom! I told you. But... how did you get out? It took a while, but um... I was finally able to figure out the security codes to... unlock the door and get help. Wow. Wow, that's crazy. Just two years ago, Emma Leeden was sitting right there lying to all of our faces about what happened in that house. It is crazy. Ain't it?
