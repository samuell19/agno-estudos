[instrumental music] - Yeah, she's a moron, she's an angry, entitled, A-list moron so just tread lightly, okay? Flutter. Flutter around her. Don't touch the ground. No, don't worry about that though. You've got Banks, Bates, and Meyers. It's enough eye candy to gain 10 pounds. Right, I understand. I know that you're worried about that. Trust me, okay? Yes, three weeks, that's it. Three weeks. Three weeks of your life, make me happy. Make me happy, it's three weeks of your life, Jason, come on. Hold on. Honey, if there's a little red squiggly line under a word it means there's a problem, okay? No, you want her on the pills, Jason, on the pills she is manageable. Off the pills she is Regan. The Exorcist. Yes, okay but what else is there to think about? Yes, I know. I know they are. Okay, but look you've been attached to this thing for three years okay? This is great. It is finally getting made, we have put a kickass package together and--yes, even with her. Yep, okay, fantastic. - So can we finish this thing or what? - No, not yet. - I'm pretty sure you were told to zip this up. - Do you still collect naval lint? - Hey man, I'm just saying. - What are you saying, Ryan? - I'm saying that a lot of us have worked pretty hard on this. We're all kind of waiting to get paid. - There are always going to be people like you waiting for people like me to finish things that they've started so that you can dot, dot, dot, okay? - You're a panoramic prick, Max. - Thank you shut the door on your way out. - Yeah, you got it man. [sniffles] - You. . . I'm Max Roth. As a kid I was obsessed with movies. Almost to the point of freakish cinematic mutation. Obviously I thought I would become an actor, but that was weird and emotional. Then I thought I would just become a movie star, [marker sounds] which is way harder than you'd think. [screaming crowd/fans sounds] What I really wanted was to be a writer [typewriter sounds] But. . . [cricket sounds] - Hey sexy. - Hey, where's the Belvedere? - I think we finished it. - Oh, you mean you finished it? - Okay. - So, why don't you go out and get me some more? - But I'm-- - I'll see you when you get back Holy shit! Who sent all these? - Sterling. - What's wrong with PDFs? - He thinks you might actually read hard copies. - Well, waste of trees? - I'm taking your car. - Okay, hurry up. - Fucking asshole. [snorting sounds] Fuck. - Ha! Yeah, no. Day's over. [guitar music plays] - You don't want me to do this, Olive. - Oh, what are you gonna do, dumbass? - Constable Dundas. - Yeah. - This orchard's gone, Olive. May wrote her will a long time ago and you aren't in it. You can't chain yourself to a peach tree and hope that changes. - I don't want to own the property cum, bubble, I want to protect it. - Well, there's not much you can do about that. - Bullshit! Arrest me. Go ahead. Yeah, come on, pull out the cuffs, arrest me ociffer! I've been a bad girl. Look, I've got 20 people who will witness and record it. I will scream bloody murder. You'll be up shit creek without a boat. - Paddle. - Both. Where are my people! Buck, buck, buck, I'm giving the signal, where are my people? [imitates wolf howl] - Ah, Jesus Christ, Olive. Get that thing out of my face, Stefan. - It's Stilts, Mr. Pancetta. - This isn't your property, Olive. - It isn't yours either, Dumbass! And if I'm not mistaken, legally speaking you need the owner's consent to remove me. So take a hike, loser! - You want to spend the rest of the weekend out here chained to a tree pissing where you stand be my guest! - I don't know, is that what it's gonna take? Is it gonna take all weekend for you people to smarten up? - Don't eat any beans. - Oh, bite me! -What?. . . -Hey, Dad. - Ah, Max, how are you? - How are you doing? - How's things? - DOD has traditional marketing DOA so everyone is freaking out a bit, but. - Well, there's always something. - Yes, there is. How's Loretta? - She's good. She's learning to speak Italian. - She's--okay, all right, language for the romantics. What are you gonna get? - I think I'm gonna have the halibut. - Oh, no Dad, you don't want to get the fish. - Fish is fine. - Yeah, if you live in Chernobyl, get something else. - I'm having the halibut. - Dad, it is toxic okay? How can you willingly, happily put that into your body? - With a double martini. - I'm not giving birth in a supermarket. That's different. It's a different story that's why there's not-- - You fucking shit! - Ah, yes, that's how it's done. If only I had hands. - I'm gonna strangle you. I smell like rotten peaches you fucking monkey bitch! Bad! - Come on, bring him over here. - Eat the peach! Eat the peach la chien! [grunts] [Olive jeering] - So this is what I want to ask you about. - What is it? - That's a good question. So I've inherited property. - Looks that way, yes. - In Canada. - Central B.C. Okanagan actually. It's beautiful up there. - Yeah, I barely remember it. - Poor May, she was an interesting woman. Unbridled. She loved Canada, was nuts about the people up there. You spent some time with her up there, you know? When you were very young. - Yeah, I remember it. The. . . fruit orchard or whatever. - Peaches, but yes. Thank you. - There you are gentlemen, have a good day. - Okay so why in the world is she leaving it to me? - I think it's best you talk to your mom. - Okay, obviously I want to sell it. - What? You don't want to run a fruit stand up in Canada? - There are so many retorts to that question I don't know where to begin. - Wow. How do you feel about this? - How do you feel about this? - Well, we hadn't spoken in years. I was notified when she died but I wasn't informed of a funeral of any kind so. . . - Okay, so why did she pick me? - Honestly, I don't know, Max, she was my sister but we were never close. I think it was easier for strangers to know her then the rest of us. We spent some summers there in the Okanagan when you were younger, and you loved it, but you loved everything then. - I'm selling it. - Okay. - You don't think I should sell it? - You just said you were. - Oh, my God, Mom, I don't have time for this. - Why is talking to me such a chore? - Nope, I got to go. I'll let you know what happens. - Love you. - Yep. - Don, we're all here. I have Mr. Chan and Mr. Tsang with me and we're all very excited to see this. They want me to let you know that they're very excited about this and money is no problem, and they're very excited. - Okay, hold on, Tarek, I'll put you on camera here. Okay, now this one's not on the market yet. It's a sneak peek okay, sneak peek. Not on the market yet but it will be soon. - They're very curious about the surroundings. - It's 20 acres, not the biggest orchard in the area but definitely has the best peaches. - No fruit, they don't want to see fruit. They don't care. They want to see the highway, Don, highway. - Okay, okay, highway, highway. - Highway. - Here we go, see that okay? Hey! - Don? Don? - Come back here you little shit! - There we go. Hi, guys! Everyone's naked in Canada. - Wait! AYAYAYAYA!! - Are you having fun? - Fly, monkey, fly! Don't let Monsieur Cherry catch you. [General Chaos] - Hey! Give me the damn phone. - Monsieur? Le pomme? - Give it to me! Hello? Hello, Tarek? [Imitates monkey screams] Are you enjoying yourself? - There's a spa in Switzerland charges a fortune for a good tree bark enema. Get it! - Put your clothes back on, Olive. Who's got the key? Who's got the key, Olive? - God. - You know, you guys don't own this property, and it's none of your goddamn business. - May didn't want this place sold for development, Don, you know that! It must've come up when she had her legs wrapped around your waist. [Laughing] - Excuse me? What'd you just say? - I'm pretty sure you heard me, Don. - Now you listen to me, you little whore. - Oh, I'm the whore? - You ever repeat this to anybody and you're gonna regret it; you understand what I'm saying? Don't. Jesus Christ. - You get that Stilts? - Oh, yeah. - Shitty time to bolt, man. - Yeah, I'll be able to do all the heavy lifting remotely. All I need you to do is take Jason and his cronies to lunch, sign that deal, and then go out for a celebratory double scotch, hm? - Don't do that. - What? No sense of humor? And you have no ass. Who hired you? Hey, honey, I can't go to lunch. - I knew you'd say that so I brought food for you. - I do not eat fish, people. - Cucumber and avocado? - Fine, but we have to head to my house so I can pack up and hit the road. - Wait, what do you mean hit the road? - Max hates flying. - I do not hate flying, okay? Driving will be good for me. It'll give me some time to sort some ideas. - Yeah, but that'll just add an extra day on both ends. - I'll fly up with you, but I am not driving all the way up there. - Don't need you to. I don't want you to okay? I'm driving, leaving today, end of story. - End of story? - Justine kissed Juliet tenderly, and began moving down her breasts. She knew her mother had just gone to bed, so it was the right time for the sleepover to commence. Juliet licked the outside of Justine's beautiful peach vaginy. As she arched her back the door opened revealing her brother, Stefan ready to consummate the night. - Just all right, don't, just stop. - Mm-mm, we don't need to stop. - Just stop it, okay? - No. - Just stop, okay? - No, I don't want to stop. - Lana, stop. - Don't want to stop. - For fuck sake, Lana, stop! Jesus Christ. What? - Nothing. - I fucking hate cocaine. This happens every single time I do cocaine. - Yeah, it happens every single time you don't do coke, too. - Seriously? I am really stressed okay? And on top of everything else I have to drive to fucking Canada to deal with this shit so can you please cut me some slack? - Sure. - I should be back in less than a week. - Okay. Don't you want me to leave? Uhh... - Nope. You can stay for a few hours, just set the alarm before you go.

She's getting worse, Jake. She almost blew a deal for me, you know? Yeah, I don't know why you can't just go up there and arrest her. - There's nothing we can do about it until we get the new owner's consent. - And when's that gonna be? - Here's a question for you, Don, why are you showing a property when it isn't even on the market yet? - My client's are from out of town. They don't know when they're gonna be back again, all right? - Out of town? - So? - So until we meet the new owner as far as I'm concerned you're all trespassing.

I'm sorry, did I interrupt like a pagan sacrifice or something? - Sure. - Okay, umm... so you're like, very, very naked aren't you? - Yep. - And she's wearing wings. Is that like a thing around here? - Definitely. - Good, okay I'm looking for May sugar's house. Do you know where it is? - Yes. - Can you tell me? Or am I gonna get tied up too? - Only if you want to. - I'm good. For now. The house? - Just open your eyes, Max. Maxwell. Maximillian? Maximus? - Just Max. Oh, okay. So I should probably get going so I'm just gonna. I'm gonna assume you don't want any help out of those. - That's a big question. - Right, yep. - Sugar wasn't her real name, you know that. - Yeah, I know. She was my aunt. - Hm, she was my friend. - Sorry for your loss. - Hey. - Yeah? - You gonna keep it? - No, I don't think so. - Hey! - Yes? - Go fuck yourself! - What? - Oh yeah, good luck selling the place, asshole. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Lovely meeting you. Fuck. [music plays] Dear mother of something fierce. [Distant giggling sound] Jesus. Oh, my God. Harold, Maude's been living in Canada. [Laughing sound through wall] [Phone buzzes] Oh, thank God. Hello? - Max? Max? - Dad? Hello, can you hear me? Fuck. Hello? - Max, are you there? - Oh yeah I'm somewhere. - Okay. - Question, what am I supposed to do with all of this crap? - I don't know, sell it? Maybe give it to a church? - I could open a museum in here. Oh, by the way there is a naked girl chained to a peach tree outside the house. - Yeah, that's one of the reasons why I'm calling. - You know that there's a naked woman chained to a peach tree outside my door? Did I somehow create my own reality series? - Brian tells me there's some pretty radical protestors around those parts and they're a real pain in the ass but they can't do much. - Good to know. - But. - Oh, no but. - Someone is contesting the will. An Olivia Cunningham. - Really? - British Columbia has special laws that allow for variation of wills. - Okay, does this variation by any chance require she protest? - No, I imagine that's just a perk. - Oh, goodie. Okay, well look I'd love to get this taken care of as soon as possible so I can get the hell out of here. - I've got Brian on it. We'll get recommendation for some council up there, okay? - All right thanks, Dad. - Good luck. - Yep, I'm gonna need it. [Distant laughing sounds] And the wet ball bounces down the stairs. Bounce, bounce, bounce. Hm. - Don't get your shoes too dirty honey, it's mucky around here. - Okay, come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on. You son of a bitch, come on. computer loses signal] Of course not. - You're kidding, right? - What? - I'm naked and chained to a peach tree, you really think I'm gonna drink from a plastic bottle? - It's French. Okay, is there a well around here, or a puddle? You want me to go out to the lake? - You could jump in it. - Hm. You know that I can legally have you forcibly removed, right? - To each his own. - Is your name Olivia by any chance? - Olive. - Hm, get a little tree confused did you? I was just wondering because I just found out that an Olivia Cunningham is contesting the will. I thought maybe that was you and we could talk, but. - Do you know how she died? - Heart failure, wasn't it? - Her heart didn't fail. It stopped. And not 'cause it was weak. It was crazy strong. It pounded so hard it was like punches. Do you remember her at all? - No, not really. - You will. - Would you like me to find a blanket to cover you up? - No. I need to be naked in the moonlight in order to draw power. [guitar music plays] - Hello? - Oh. - Morning. - Morning. - Constable Jake Dundas. - Max Roth. - Just came by to see if you wanted us to remove your new house guest. - Fuckers! - Well, she can't be comfortable. - No. - And I imagine that's not very safe. - Probably not. - Suck my hairy bum hole! - Okay, come on in. She do this often? - Well, she's a good kid. - Right. - Good heart. - Good. - So you want me to get her out of your hair or? - Yeah, are you gonna arrest her? I don't want you to press charges or anything. - No, no, she's got an older brother that usually wrangles her in. - Oh, good. - Hey. Morning. - Hey. - Jake. - Don. Nice to meet you, Max. - Thank you. Hey, you must be my new neighbor. - Oh, I don't know about that. Max Roth. - Don Cherry. - Really? - Yeah, man. - Any uhh- - Nah, nah, nah, I get a lot of that. - Okay. - Nice piece of property you inherited. - It is, yeah. - Yeah, must be quite a shock for you. - Oh yeah. - You American? - Yeah, that's right. - Right on. Listen, I'm here, I got a group of people, they want to buy your property if you're interested in selling. - Yeah, no I absolutely am but there's a couple things I got to figure out first. - Oh, don't worry about it. We'll get over the agriculture thing no problem. - The agriculture what? - Ah, it's some pesticides and-- - She's gone. - What? She was tied up 15 seconds ago. - She must've headed to her brother's. - What? Naked? - She's done stranger things. Do you mind if I check inside first? - No, please be my guest. Watch the weird stuff. Radio: We've got an 1126 in the course of a 288 call on Lakeside drive near the fire hall. - Copy that, 15 away. - 10-4. - Olive? - My people have prepared a very generous offer; I just want to let you know. And you're not gonna make any money off this orchard, that's for sure. - What? - It's probably gonna cost you. - Mm-hmm. - Leave the fruit to the farmers I've always said. - Fruit to the farmers, yes. - I don't see anything. - Nothing, huh? - Listen, here's my card. Give me a call if you run into any trouble. I'm gonna see if she's headed over to Andy's. - All right, thank you. - Alright, see you later, Jake. Nice to meet you, Max. - Yeah, - Listen, if you have any questions at all don't hesitate to call. - All right. - All right? I left my card on your windshield wiper. - Okay. - Okay, I'll talk to you soon, all right? - Take care. - Okay. - Yep. [bottles and cans clatter] - I hope you don't mind. Was feeling a little peckish. - Well, you are a strange bird. - Definitely. You gonna turn me in, Clyde? - Couldn't if I wanted to. I don't have any reception. [Phone buzzes] Holy shit! No, no, no, shit, shit, shit. Ryan? Ryan? Ryan! Can you hear me? Yes, thank--yes, how did the lunch go? What? What do you mean not good? No a fuck! Ow, fuck! Dude a fucking teletubby could've done that lunch! No, just leave it. Just leave it. Just--I'll call him, okay? Leave it. I'll call him. I'll call him. I'll call him! Fuck, fuck, fuck. Beth! Beth! Hold on! Yeah, yeah, Beth? Yes, hi, hi, Max Roth. It's Max Roth. Max, Max, yes, Max Roth. Can you put Jason on the line please? Put Jason on the phone right now. No, no, no, I'm not yelling at you. I'm not yelling at you, I'm yelling at Canada. Yes, just put him--I know, I know, I know I'm cutting out. Just put Jason on the fucking line! Hello? Oh! Fuck! Oh I hate this fucking place. Good. Just fucking good. [music plays] - [singing] Je suis. - What are you doing? - Silly question. - Okay, you're not very fond of clothes, are you? Okay. - So what do you remember about May? - I told you, nothing. I was very young. - I don't believe you. - Okay, I remember she had a very loud laugh. It was funny, unless you weren't ready for it, in which case it was just plain scary. She also laughed at all her own jokes. - Yeah, yeah. - Hm? - Oh, no I'm good. I'm still good, thanks. - Oh for Pete's sake. - What? I don't eat gluten. Okay. Mm. - I think on paper she would've read as an over-aged delinquent. But in the flesh it felt immediately necessary. For life, you know? To keep on living. - So you are related to her how? - I'm not. - You're not? - Mm-mm. - You're contesting the will. You can't contest the will if you're not related. - Oh, I'll figure it out, I know. I just wanted to buy some time, let them divide and scatter while I come up with a new plan. - And have you got one? - I think so. - What is it? - Seduction. - Of who? Of me? Oh, wow. Okay, you're very sure of yourself, aren't you? - Mm-hmm. - Hm, good okay. Well here's the interesting thing. That's never gonna happen because I'm not remotely attracted to you. - No? - No. - So if I pressed my hand to your crotch right now? - Nothing. - Nothing? - No. - Hm. - Okay, I'm gonna go. This has been super fun but I got a lot of work to do and amongst other deficiencies around here there is no internet connection or cell service. So stellar, thanks for breakfast. One more thing, Olive, I'm not gonna turn you in but the Sheriff, he mentioned something about an older brother, maybe it's a good idea to go see him? Look, I appreciate that you lost a friend, and that you miss her. I do. And I'm sorry about that okay? I really, truly am but here's the thing, I'm gonna sell this property as soon as I can and return back to my normal life. So please excuse me while I go return to the 21st Century. - Shouldn't you shower first?

[Phone buzzes] - Hey, Dad, what's up? - It seems you have a little agricultural issue. - Sounds terrifying, what does it mean? - Well I made some calls. It looks like the orchard is protected by the Agricultural Land Reserve which requires certain property to be maintained as agricultural. - Okay, well that doesn't sound good. - Well, selling it could be an issue if the buyer wants to develop it. I contacted a friend who put me in touch with a lawyer up there who is going to put the paperwork through to request it be removed. - Hold on. Oh yeah, go.

Andy and I were in and out of the system, we were bounced around a lot. I was always in trouble. - Really? - And Andy was always fixing everything, bringing in strays. That's how he has the farm now. All those animals are rescues, and May helped him with that. - Hemingway. [Imitates pig sounds] What did she do for a living? - She lived. - Okay, but how did she make money? - She didn't need money. - Don't be ridiculous, everybody needs money. - She made things out of... Well, I guess she gave people pleasure. - So what? This place was a bordello? [laughs] - No. Well, sort of. - What? - Maybe it was. - What? Explain. - Describing it is hard. - Try. - I stink. I'm gonna take a bath. Wanna come? - Okay, I'm sorry, so, wait a minute, what? How can you just say that so casually? I'm supposed to just, like, follow you and take a bath with you? - Only if you want to. Hey, hold on. Hold on. Hold on. Hey, easy tiger, hold on. - I thought you wanted this. - I do want this, but not like this. - What? - You're fucking me. - Yeah, you took your shirt off and you practically, like-- - No, I know that. But you're fucking me. - Okay, well if you didn't want that then maybe you should reconsider acting like a whore. - Whoa. - I'm sorry, I do not understand how anybody could act like that if you don't-- - Just slow down. It's like you're doing something that needs to be over. - Okay, I am sorry to have disappointed you. - Do you want to dance? - No. - Will you dance? - No. - If I ask nice? - I'm sure I would just do it all wrong. - Oh, God, you're such a baby! Will you please dance with me? - Okay, if I dance with you are you going to give me instructions? - Probably. Come on. [dance music] [Soft music] - Yeah. Yeah - Oh really? [laughs] - Get cracking, Mister, we have to meet in a trial of law. - I almost forgot, Olivia Cunningham contesting the will, 10 am. - Bum, bum, bum, you're going down! - What? I'm American. - Eat your breakfast. - You like your food. - And you like your movies. - You eat a lot. - You fart in your sleep. - What? No I don't. - Yeah, you do. - No I don't. - Yeah, you do. [court music] - All rise. Third matter before the Superior Court of British Columbia Peachland on this third day of August, 2015 Olivia Cunningham--Rise, rise! And the estate of the May Elizabeth Sprag respondent, and Maxwell Roth respondent. - Everybody here? - Peter Cosky on behalf of the respondent Maxwell Roth, my client is present as is the applicant, Ms. Cunningham but no one is here on behalf of the estate. - Ms. Cunningham, do you have a lawyer? - No I do not, Your honor, sir! - You claim to be the daughter of the late Ms. Sprag. In order to bring this application at all you must be a spouse or child of the deceased. Are you a blood relative at all of Ms. Sprag's? - There's no evidence whatsoever, M'Lord, that the applicant is a child of the deceased. We have an affidavit by a Mr. Donald Cherry Mr. Cherry, who is a long-time friend of-- [sarcastic laugh] Mr. Cherry was a close friend of the deceased for over 20 years and says he was there when the applicant first met Ms. Sprag. When they were introduced as complete strangers by Shirley Cornwall. If the applicant can't produce real, and credible evidence that she is a child of the deceased then her application simply cannot stand and this court has no jurisdiction to vary the will of Ms. Sprag. In that case I request that the application be denied in its totality. - I tend to agree, Council, do you have any evidence whatsoever that you are a true and legal daughter of the deceased? - No, I do not. - I'm sorry, Olive, you got your request Council, application is denied. We're concluded. - All rise. - Well, put up a good fight, Olivia Cunningham. - Ain't over yet, Maxie Pooh. - Now I shall go drink to my victory. - And I to my defeat. Well played, Councilor. - Thanks, Max, I'm gonna need your signature to submit your application. - Application for what? - To remove May's property from agricultural reserve. - What? - May's property is on an agricultural reserve and Max wants it removed. - Well, I haven't decided yet. - May's property is protected. - Max is the property's owner now, so. - You knew this? - Not entirely, I-- - You didn't tell me? - I came here to sell the land, Olive, I live in Los Angeles. I have a life in Los Angeles. It's where I work. If I still even have a job. - You're an asshole. - This doesn't mean anything, okay? This is just so I have options. - Better go explore your options. - Olive. - Everything okay here? - Fuck off, Don. - How many times do I got to tell you to watch your mouth? - You watch my mouth, Don, fuck you, you sleazy, demented, monarch from Hell. - I am so sick of you. We're all sick of you, Olive. - Is that right everybody? Well all right, later traitor! - Olive. [clutter] - What is wrong with you? You're drinking out of plastic. Plastic! - Here we go. There's nothing you can do. You just got to let it run its course. She's either got to stay on her meds, or somebody's got to lock her up in a cage. - Oh, my God. - Again. - Olive, stop, stop! Let's just go home, okay? - Don't worry, good people of Peachland, my cavalry has arrived on his high and mighty steed to take me away, make me disappear so you can all go on living your merry lives with your heads shoved up your assholes. Yeah. Carry on, please! - I'll take it from here. Sorry. - Don't! Don't! - Just give her some space and respect, please. I can handle it, I--come on! - No, no, don't touch me! - Olive. Don't. Don't. I said don't. - I just want to talk to her. - No! - You can't talk to her. - No! - Get your hands off of me. - You need to leave her the fuck alone! - There it is. Hold for awkward silence! Why don't you all just dance and play with me! [Echoing voices, laughter] Open your eyes 'cause I'm the crazy one! Who are you! Get a brain! You're all so goddamned sad! Just too afraid to show it. . . [cries] I just want to die... [clock ticks] [sniffle] I'm sorry. - It's okay, pal.

[laughs] I mean that's how I feel about myself. [laughter] [voices, laughter echoes] - Hey. - Hey yourself, what's that? - Well I packed up May's things. - What? Wow. - Yeah, I don't know. I just threw in a couple things I thought you and Olive might like. - Thank you. - Yeah.

She could totally part with it. - You won. - Yeah, I won. - You know that Aunt May gave me this ring? She said that she got it when she was my age, when she was trying to figure out who she was which is exactly what I'm trying to do. Carpe diem, it means seize the day. - I know that. - Oh right, I didn't. Yeah. She said I'd understand when I was older, but that at a certain point it just becomes silly holding onto things, especially when it means something to someone new. - Then why wouldn't she give me this? [both laugh] Come here. [upbeat music plays] - Oh, no, don't don't - What do you want for dinner? - I'm not really hungry. I'm trying to work. - I'm not stopping you. - Okay. - So you're writing again? - Trying to. - Well I'm glad that you're getting back into it. - I'm not getting back into it. I'm just trying a few things. - You know what? - What? - I don't want to do this anymore. - No? - No. - I don't either. - Okay. - Okay. - I'm gonna go get my stuff. - Do you need any help? - No, I'll manage. [phone rings] - Hey, Max, Don Cherry here. - Ah, Don, I will never get used to that. - So, good news, council lifted the agricultural reserve on your property without a problem. - Oh, okay. - And that buyer is still really interested. So you're ready to make a deal. - Yes, look I don't know. I'm not quite sure I'm gonna sell right away so. - Well I don't think you're gonna come down and run it yourself now are you?

That is the worst part. - That doesn't matter. - It does matter. It matters to me. - You'll be tagged. You won't be able to cross the border, or any border until I get this expunged. So you just sit tight for a while. - What am I supposed to do about the property? - Sell it. Contact the realtor. You said you had some decent prospects. Let him sell it, Max, move on. Go back to work. - No! No, I am not going back to work, Dad! - Well how the hell do you expect to make a living? - I don't know, okay? But I don't want to chase my life. I want to be in it. - I have no idea what that means. - I have no idea how you don't understand this. I hope to God that one day you do. - Max? Max!

Wow, look at all these old photos, wow. - Yep. - These are amazing. These of you? - Oh, no, not all of them.
