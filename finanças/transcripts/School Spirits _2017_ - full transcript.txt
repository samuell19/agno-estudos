What was that? Probably just some animal. That's what everybody says before they get attacked by some psycho. What? I'm cold. This is a town time passed by. what are you doing to me? I conspire to ruin your life at every turn. Apparently, I'm succeeding. Hashtag, truth. Hashtag. Dad, don't do that. We have to go. This is it, munchkin. What do you think? Isn't it great? What horror movie did you move us into? Aah, it's not so bad. - Okay. - Whoa. Creepy neighbors. What? Nothing. Hey, um, why don't you take Carl and pick out a room? My bedroom. It's back in Chicago. Nice. The realtor said the keys are underneath the doormat. Oh, we don't lock doors here, in Heathsville, Missouri. Bad things only happen in big cities. Well, Carl, we're here. You would have liked this house, Mom. September, 16th. Carl moves to Newberry, Missouri. No outward physical indicators of negative response to move yet, but we'll keep close eye on him. At least you don't have to start school tomorrow. We got this. Goodnight, Carl. Goodnight, Mom. Good morning, students, of Bob Cat High. Reminder that carnival is this weekend. Support your school by purchasing tickets from the pet van. What is this? Excuse you, what are you doing with my stuff? What? You must have made a mistake. I'm sorry. I thought that they said this was my locker. - It's my first ti... - Oh, no, see, that's your mistake. I don't care what that says. This is my locker. And the one next to it is my other locker. And the one next to that, and the one next to that, both mine. I'm sorry. I didn't know. Ladies, ladies, she didn't know. Which is why we're at school, right, to learn. So, what do you think the best way to teach her a lesson, is? Hey, Jessie. What do you want, weirdo? Billy had his phone on. I think he was filming you. Billy, give me that phone. What are you, some sort of school paparazzi? Don't worry about Billy. He spread a rumor about Ryan, last week. my name's Billy. I can just secretly record people. Losing his phone is just karma. - Hope you have apple care. - Tara. - Zoey. - Where are you from? - Chicago. - Chicago. Nice. The city. How's the deep dish? "Go Bears." What's her deal? Try and Snapchat me now! Hey. Some women just want to watch the world burn. Who's your home room? Rathman. The Rath. We've been sentenced to the same fate. - Follow me. - Thanks. Hey, Tara. Those dance videos you sent me were fire. Awesome. Glad you liked it. Hey, new girl. Make sure you shut my locker. Tara, see you in the Rath. - You're going the wrong way. - What was that, Tar? Boys. Come on. Rath's this way. If this is on Snapchat, I will end you. Purse boy! Here we are. Uh, just don't pull out your phone. Good luck. Mr. Anderson. Here. Mr. Berkley. Sorry, Mr. Rathman. Everyday, Mr. Cooper. - Well, see I... - Stop, I already know. Everything is more important than school. Take a seat. And turn of your theme music. Miss Dunnmore. All right, you little monsters. Let's get going. Hey! Who are you? And why are you not in appropriate gym attire? Oh, I'm new here. I didn't... Ohhh. I cannot legally let you participate in physical education without approved gym clothing. Pearson. Lead 'em in warm-ups. All right. I'm in charge. Stretch your left arm. As you cannot participate, I'm forced to give you a zero. Because without a doctor's note, each student is expected to take every measure to ensure participation. Zero for the day. Sideline. It's my first day here... It hurts me as much as it hurts you. Trust me. Sideline. Kirby! You call that a jumping jack? Keep going. Move it. Move it. I wanna see some sweat. Let's go. Come on. You're not a bunch of girls. Ow. Ow. What? What? Kirby. Are you hurt or are you injured? Come on. Let's go. I wonder where he is. Are you sure we should be doing this? Ned said to always bring salt. Ned also hasn't left his room in 50 years. That's true. Do you think table salt would work? Enough about salt, okay? Did you bring the ball? Yeah. Are you sure we don't need salts, just in case? Are you gonna slow down a little boy? It was just an idea. We're a little past flinching, wouldn't you say? No. No, I would not say that. Someone else is here. Hi, there. Wanna play ball? Hey, wanna go for a swim? Oohh. Hey! New girl! Enough already! Sorry. Interesting. There wasn't a splash. - Something wrong? - That can't be. - What are you doing home? - This isn't my home. What happened, Zoe? Zoe. Yeah. This is him. Oh, hi. Yeah, she's here. She left the gym class? Yeah, this won't happen again. All right. I appreciate that. Thank you. Brain storm with me, Carl. Something rational. Something rational. A projector? Maybe? Zoey? Should I be concerned? No. It was just... What if you don't believe something you saw? Hmm. Well, that's an interesting dilemma. Hmm. Maybe ask a better question. I believe systems don't really matter, unless something can be repeated. You're right. Ah. I need more than that. What happened, Zoey? This house is haunted. I love that our school's haunted. Of course you would be happy. Why do you think he's still there? The little boy? I don't know. That's where he died. You think Ned knows him? No. Ned would have told us. Hi, Otto. See? Aww. You know where we should go next? Oh, absolutely not. Oh, come on. Don't you wanna visit widow Wellesley? Grandma Mae's gonna lose it when she sees her refrigerator door standing over like that. All right. I need to see the book. Oh, the twins have parent-teacher conferences tonight. So, I'm in charge of you ladies. We'll see about that. True. 'Cause I was about to go hoop with Ryan. Oh, and Tara, you're more than welcome to come. Shirts versus skins, and Ryan's skin, so, you know. Okay, will you get out of here? - We have work to do. - Sorry. Okay, cool. All right. Dinner's in the oven. Uh, Tara, your invite stays. Fine. Go away, Wayne. Focus, woman. All right. Look, here's the most famous story of them all. The neighbors said that they heard trains and wailing. - We have to go. - How about not? Why don't you wanna go? Because the little boy today was adorable. She sounds scary. Oh, come on, please. Pretty please, with a Ryan on top? Zoey, dinner's ready. Where are you? In the attic, proving this house is haunted. I'm definitely not stealing wi-fi. Hmm, just borrowing, yeah. Internet. Yes. Look who's battered now. Look who's battered now. Well, that's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen. Wooaahhh. What? Retro. If it can be repeated, it can be recorded. Get over here, the fisherman's started. Right now. New recipe. Whoo-hoo. So all after-school activities will be canceled until the key to the teacher's bathroom is returned. The faculty will not negotiate with troublemakers. The upstairs bathrooms are still closed pending repairs. Today's lunch will be chili surprise. Good luck. Mr. Anderson. She isn't really bad. I know. She... Mr. Berkley. Mr. Cooper. - Sorry, Mr. Rathman. - I'm sure you are. And I'm sure it will happen again, tomorrow. Take a seat. Music, Mr. Cooper. Miss Dunnmeyer. Hey, Tara. - Hey, Zoey. - Do you have a sec? I have lots of secs. No, I don't. I have... I do have seconds. Not... Not that it's a bad... Um... How are you? How's, uh, your first few days been? Well, I've been trying... I mean, I didn't have the right... It's always hard. This is a renewal. It's always hard the first couple of days. It's a school project. Uh, what's up? I was wondering what class you have fourth period. Uh, fourth period, I don't have class. Uh, why? Why do you ask? I have a few questions. I'm late. I have to go. But, maybe, we can talk about this later. Maybe. Ryan. I'm not here. - Wait. Who is it? - Ryan Winburn. Is he looking? Don't look. Is he looking? Don't look. - Stop looking at him. - Sorry. Can I see him? Shh. How can you not see him? Look, I saw something yesterday and I'm not gonna be able to let this go. I knew, I knew someone else was there. Okay, I'm gonna need Morgan for this. She's not gonna be happy. Oops. No, no. He's still there. Winning is an all the time thing. It's not a some time thing. It's a habit. Unfortunately, so is losing. Especially with you boys. Their loss is actually your fault. Because you're running when you should be passing, and you're passing when you should be running and you're not attacking at your perceived weakest. Morgan. Frankly, you should be punished with them. You gotta go back to being a girl now? Girl the whole time. All right, guys, I said around the building. How long is it gonna take? Zoey, Morgan. Morgan, Zoey. Morgan, Zoey has questions. Please let the record show that Tara has refrained from saying, "I told you so." What happened at the pool, yesterday? I told you someone else was there. I told you so. Tara doesn't know how to swim. - I was teaching her. - In a dark, scary pool, that clearly hasn't been used? - She gets shy in public places. - There. - She had body issues. - What, just, I don't. Okay, what's going on? - There was a boy there. - Okay, you're talking gibberish. - We don't have time for this. - Morgan, she was there. She hasn't told anyone. - How do you... - I think we should take her to go see Ned. No one, no how. That's what we said, remember? Who's Ned? Fine. Let's go. The music room? My favorite place in the whole school. There's nobody here. Hey, Ned. Ned? Very funny. Hey, Zoey. Meet Ned. Boo. Sorry, I couldn't help myself. Good to know you, Zoey. How goes it, Sarge? What! Down low. Too slow. And you? My little shamalama ding dong. We met Ned last year. And since then, we've been looking for more... Ghosts. - Ghosts. - Now girls, don't tease. You know I prefer "spiritually liberated". No. No, no, no, no. Nuh-uh. Nope. Yeah. What! Was it my breath? I... I can change. Oh, my gosh. What the heck was that? Answers. What am I, your mark? I'm your mark, aren't I? Make the new girl your mark. Okay, will you quit saying "mark"? We don't have time for this. You don't have time? You don't have time? Time is an indefinite continued progress of existence. It's not something one has. I don't know what you just said, - but you better watch yourself. - Okay, enough. Okay, Zoey, we didn't know you followed us down to the pool, yesterday. We brought you here because I thought Ned could give you some answers. He's a spirit of a teacher that worked here in the 60s. At the pool was the spirit of a boy who drowned a couple of years back. Wait, what are you doing? Uh, don't give that to her! Since you can't not know now. No. No. No. There's no way. She's an unknown risk. I think she'll come around quickly. What'd you tackle me for? You ran, I reacted. Oh yes, that's a completely normal reaction. I didn't know if you were actually there. Right. Also completely normal thing to think. Now I know. Right. Hi. Who are you? Why aren't you in school? And why are you watching me? I'm Link. I'm your next door neighbor. I don't go to school. I won the cystic fibrosis lottery, so... And I don't watch you. I mean I... My window's right there, so you'll be in your... I might be in my room, and... Enjoying the day, looking out the window and then, there you are, it's not... You're the one without curtains. That's not permission. That went so great. Dad, I'm seeing things. And I need curtains. Dad? Dad. Dad? Dad. Dad. Yeah. Agreed. - Dad, I need curtains and I need you to... - Zoey. Munchkin, I'm on the phone. I need you to figure it out. Can you hang on a second? Zoe? Are you okay? Uh, how was school? It was fine. - Really? 'Cause it looks like you've seen a ghost. - Nope! Don't even say it. What did I say? All good, pops, just gonna go figure it out. Hi, yeah, I'm sorry. I've got a teenage daughter. I don't... Yeah. Are you still with me, Mom? One question at a time. And they say that I'm always late. Best make-out spot, ever. What? What is it? Nothing. I just, I felt something. Come on. So, what do you think of Zoey? I don't. Now let's go over the plan for the widow's house. You're gonna go and distract her, and I'm gonna make sure all the rooms are clean. So, I'm gonna be the bait, again. I hate being the bait. But you're so good at it. - That's true. - And I always swoop in, that's my role. Sure, but this isn't the playground. No, this is the spirit of an angry woman who pushed her husband in front of a train. This is a bad idea. What are you so worried about? We brought the salt this time. Oh, now you're a fan of salt. I'm just following Ned's advice. Using consecrated salt and burning sage to stop a ghost. What could go wrong? Aren't you just the life of the party. Oops! Right, I'm gonna start upstairs. You get her attention. She knows we're here. No. See, I didn't need to know that. You need to start turning your Spidey senses off. Hey, if I have to know, you have to know. Mrs. Wellesley. I'm Tara. Upstairs is Morgan. We come in peace. We know you killed your husband, Gusto. Subtle, Tara. But we're not here to judge. Uh, we'd just like to help you move on. Get out! Morgan! The sage isn't working. You don't say! - What now? - Read the other thing. Uh, okay. "By the light of this moon, I will rise free, - out of your shackles..." - No visitors. It isn't working. "Unseen as me, protected as me." - Morgan, we have to go. - Get out. Morgan! Go, go, go. Hi, neighbor. It's Link. Remember? Remember earlier? It's me. Hey! Hey! Okay, bye. Run time. I want to assure you that we can understand your frustration with the bathroom situation. However, toilet paper in the faculty vehicles will not be tolerated. And finally, today's lunch has been changed. Mexican corn carne. Hey. Um... Look, I'm sorry if Morgan came of a little intense, yesterday. She can be a little uptight when it comes to most things, actually. But she's cool, really. We've been friends since forever. Uh, she's cuddly. Like deep, deep, deep, deep deep underneath all the, uh, the layers. Okay. She's not really cuddly, she doesn't like hugs. Um... Are you doing okay? Mr. Anderson. Mr. Berkeley. Mr. Cooper. Miss Dunnmeyer. Morgan, have you heard anything? I told you so. You owe me five bucks. I don't owe you no five bucks. Hey, guys. I have gym upstairs, fourth period. Mrs. S must be stinged you're not in uniform. What you got there? Basically, it's an EMF reader. But I altered the plan so it transduces electromagnetic waves to sound waves. Instead of measuring electromagnetic fields, it listens to them. And then, my tape deck lets me record them. It's a step towards testable predictions. You can't prove anything by listening to EMF waves. Everything puts out EMF waves. Your phone, the microwave. But if you could hear the difference between the waves... - You're a nerd, aren't you? - How is that helpful? Look, sorry, but while we're out here finding ghosts we're trying to prove they exist by using a cassette. They're real, sweetheart. What more proof do you need? I'm not trying to prove anything... Where's the salt? You could be part of my planning. Run, run, run. Was that the widow? No. Who's the widow? Where were you standing? How are you not wet? What was that? We've never seen that. How many spirits have you seen? Like three. Yeah. Three. Ned, the pool boy and widow Wellesley. And that wasn't the widow? Oh, no. Here comes trouble. He's coming, he's coming, he's coming this way. Do I look okay? I look great. Psst. Black smoke reaching from the other side, she's cool but, a cute boy, she freaks out. Hey, Tara. Wayne's sister. It's Morgan. And new girl. I'm Zoey. What happened, you guys showered together or something? Why are you both wet? I'm, I... I'm sorry. Hey, listen, have you heard from Mickey at all? No, not today. No one has. He kind of went missing after last night. Um, if you hear from him, can you let me know? Sure. Great. Hey, are you going to the carnival? - Are you going to the carnival? - I'll be there. - You should come. - That's cool. We should both go. That'd be so cool. That's be the coolest. All right, hopefully I'll see you there. I'll see you maybe, in... Sometimes I see you and you don't... It's, you don't, but, see me, but... I see you all the time, and it's... - I'll see you later. - All right, then. Save Mickey. - See you later, Zoe. - I'll see you, bye. - Smooth! - Ow. I can't help it. Ryan's a unicorn. Even those that are lucky enough to get close to can't hold onto it. He belongs to the wind. What is she saying? Don't even pay attention to her. Okay, will you keep it together? We have very important supernatural problems that we need to deal with. His smile can brighten the darkest of places. I'm going back to the pool. Hey, new girl! Let's go! Let's go! God! I was trying to do a thing, you guys. I'm sorry, I'm still stuck on this towering, black cloud of smoke. Uh, you said, here? In the school? Shouldn't we be running? Isn't it just another spirit? I don't think I've ever met a spirit quite like that. Wait, guys, containment. The hypothesis makes sense. My Walkman measures electromagnetic fields, and that's energy. There's got to be a way to harness it. Contain it. Okay, you just went full nerd now. Big couple days for you, huh? I dig the ingenuity, Doctor. Okay, but how? That I don't know yet. - Helpful. - Well, it could be. After all, we didn't do so great with the widow, and - whatever was in the pool... - It's purely hypothetical. I have no idea what to use for the materials. I could work on it over the weekend, though. - Perfect. - Really? Ned, is this even possible? - What is the matter? - Do you have a better idea? Good. Great. Then I say, why not? We don't know what was in the pool, but it seems serious. Thank you, Zoey. Just let us know how we can help. Hey, Zoe, dinner's almost ready. We got lasagna. Okay. Is that my equipment? Yeah, I borrowed it. Zoe, these aren't toys. These are things I need for work. I know they aren't toys. I'm not playing. I'm working. - Is it for school? - No. - What is it? - Dad, look, it's nothing. Can I just have some privacy? Okay, okay, if that's what you want. - Yeah. - Just, just be careful. I mean it. I heard you. All right. Dinner soon. Someone else is here. He's mine. That's the most disturbing thing I've ever seen. Interesting. - That thing... - She sounds scary. - What are you doing? - She knows we're here. Oh, no. Today... Hey, Mr. Don. Working on a Saturday? It's the only day the project supervisor can meet. You mind taking out the trash? I'm running late. - Hey, Dad. - Yeah. Do you think that... Never mind, I can see you're busy. What is it? Well, I've been trying to build a capacitor to store energy and I put the wiring into a loop, but, I'm stuck on the housing. Is this what you've been working on? What's it for? Um, a hypothesis. That spiritual energy can be trapped and contained. You trying to find Casper? Well, let me know when you catch him. You think it's a joke? People can stick around. Is it so crazy to think that maybe she's watching? Uh, I believe what I see, Zoey. Never mind, just go to work. Okay, hey, hey, you know, I don't know what I did here, but I'm getting a little tired of this dismissive behavior. Sounds like a "you" problem. Just go to work. Hey, neighbor. I'm about to uh, go for a run. Okay. No, I meant, remember the last time I did that, you, uh, tackled me, or as you put it, "reacted". - Uh-huh, yep. - Remember that? Late nights, uh, night, night, late night? I meant, I aid that because you look tired, not because... You don't look tired. I haven't been looking through your window. Uh, how about the weekend? Not the band, I meant, like, the event. Um, how... Are you doing anything? I'm not doing anything. There's this carnival, I was thinking - you wanna... - Listen, Link, is it? Link. I'm busy trying to deduce what housing to use to encase tangible electricity emitted for another plane of existence. I don't have time for a carnival. Okay. Hey, excuse me. Eyes up here. Yeah! Uh, no, no no, sorry. Um... Your crystal, your necklace, your necklace crystal... - What about it? - Crystals have refractory angles that can capture electromagnetic energy. Just bounces around in there, unable to escape. It's semi permeable so energy can go into a crystal but it can't get out once it's in there. Impressive. Thank you. I'm the town sick kid, so you know, I basically sit in my room reading all day. I mean, comics, but - they're based in truth. - Thanks. Thanks. Caterpillar. - Hey Zoey. - Yeah. Can we talk to you? - Sure. - Sure. No, her. Of course. - Thanks, again. - Yeah. I think that went well. Me, too. All right, let's go. And you don't think it was a nightmare? It felt like a warning. That something's here, and it scares me. Take her word for it. She knows this kind of stuff. - She's always known this kind of stuff. - I've noticed. What's with that? My aunt, Asmae, is sensitive, and she thinks I am, too. - She thinks she a shaman. - I don't know about that. But, uh, sometimes I just feel things. So, anyway, how's that thing? Almost there. It's just about finding something to withstand the heat generated by the circuitry. But I have an idea. Well, we need to make sure it works before we try it out on whatever that thing was. How much longer do you think you'll need? Not much longer. - I don't know. - Hey, you can do it. Well, a bad plan now, is better than a good plan too late, so why don't you go in there and get it done, Tara and I will get the supplies and then later, I say we re-visit good old widow Wellesley. Yeah, sounds good. Yeah, all right, on three, break. Let's go. She's late. I'm sure she'll be here soon. No way. This is widow Wellesley's house? Yeah. Wait till you see inside. And if they're there, it's actually a very beautifully crafted home. Well, yeah. That's cool. What's wrong with you both? What? Nothing. Just running on little sleep. Oh, I finished. Now just get me close enough to make contact. Okay, so what's the plan? That's a good one. You're not going to like it. Come on, there's nothing to be scared of. Guys, guys, wait. Wait for me. Mrs. Wellesley. Here, widow, widow. Sorry to bother you again. Why are you so angry? This is my house. Get out! She's coming. She's really mad. Zoey, where are you? Zoey! Zoey! My head... Just so free. Get out! My head is just so big. It hurts. Zoey, hand over the device. I need more salt. Zoey, now! - Zoey, sweetheart, are you there? - Mom? Now, get out! Get out! You think that weakened her? Did you hear that? That woman's voice. Children, distracted so easily. Good show, ladies. It's here. Well, you heard the woman. Get out! Go, go, go! Hey, hey I wasn't following you. - Quick, run! - What? Holy... Zoey... - Link! - Aah! - No! - Zoey! Run! Aah! - Go, go, go. Let go. - Link! Zoey, run! - Link! - Go, go, keep running Zoey, don't stop. That thing was waiting for us. She's with Zoey. We still don't know if that dumb contraption even works. What's your deal, Zoey? I was trying to help Link. I'm talking about what was happening in the house. With the widow. I heard my mom's voice. She died when I was nine. - Great. - Morgan! We don't have time for your mommy issues. Zoey, wait, wait. We still need you. No, we don't! Who put you in charge? Really, Tara? You can't manage a team. You can barely tie your own shoes, if it's not for me. Get this through your head. I'm not your sidekick. We're partners. And like it or not, Zoey is too. Why are you being such a control freak? I'll talk to her, just meet us at Ned's in an hour. Dad, are you home? Dad? What happened to you? What's up, Morgan? I have a weak team. I don't know how I'm supposed to help them, I mean I told them exactly what to do, how to win, and they just... God says you can't tell a man how to do something. Tell them what to do and let them surprise you. Wayne, you guys have lost every single game. I know, but we use what we got. We use who we've got. Our weaknesses are just strengths in other areas. Just so happens that our strengths aren't exactly on the field. Zoey, hand us the device. I need more salt. Put me down! Zoey, sweetheart, are you there? Do you ever think about Mom and Dad? Yeah. Always. Why, do you? I don't really remember them. Yeah, you were pretty young when they died. And that sucks. Yeah, it does. Ned? Ned? How did it go, Doctor? Have you unlocked the secrets of harnessing the afterlife? Are you here to trap me? No. I don't know. I screwed it up. Then that thing showed up and my friend, I just left him. - He could be... - Hey, hey, hey, it's all right, munchkin. Where are Tara and Morgan? They're coming. Ned, you said that you knew other ghosts. That you hadn't met ones like the black cloud. How did you find them? What are you asking, Zoey? I heard my mom's voice when I went to test the device on widow Wellesley. I'm sure it was her. Could it have been her? Just because ghosts are real, doesn't mean your mom is one. Everyone sort of goes along their own path, in the after life. Doesn't mean she isn't one, either. But, uh, what's important is who is here. All right, angels, what's the plan? Mickey. Tara, you said that you saw Mickey in your dream. Why does it matter? Feeling things, knowing things. - It's gotta amount to something. - I think she's right, Tara. You should listen. Where were you? It was dark, but it smelled like burned popcorn. Listen to me, where did you see Mickey? He was sitting in a chair. Uh... There were lights and he was scared. - Kill her. - He's trying to tell me something. There's someone else there. It's the same thing that's stalking us. - It's a woman's spirit. - Oh, lady ghost. It's terrifying, actually. She's old and powerful. She wants something from Mickey. So, she's feeding off his energy. Tell us where you are. I'm standing on grass. The walls were striped. It as a tent. The carnival. - The carnival's here in town. - Oh, fun. Wait. Half the school's at the carnival, tonight. I bet that's where we can find her. Ryan's at the carnival. But, how are we supposed to defeat the smoke lady? - Whaddup, stud? - Hey, there, Jessie. I was looking for you. Oh, really, what's up? Just thought, you know, we could enjoy the carnival together. Aha, and why is that? Because I'm Jessie Pearson, and you're Ryan Limburm. But what are we supposed to do? We'll need this. I think I just need to maintain contact. Looks like we're going to the carnival. Are we ready for this, guys? Of course we are. She's got Link, and Mickey. Let's do this. Okay. - Do we need anymore salt? - Always with the salt. Wait, explain the salt to me. - Don't worry about it, nerd girl. - Hey! See, I can be normal. I like someone else. So what? Hold my hand. I like someone else. Ryan! Tara, what's wrong? Is Ryan in trouble? Are they nearby? Tara, can you feel where he's at? I don't know. Just try! Come on. This way. - There! - Shh. Sorry. That's her. Ryan's awake. Hello, little ones! Where did that thing just go? We didn't think, we should've called grown-ups or something. Just stop. - We'll think of something. - Like what? That's the best you came up with and we don't even know if it works. And now, you're relying on me. I'm just the bait. You're the brains. Hey, you guys are the ghost chasers here. - I'm just the new girl. - You're both wrong, you idiots. Zoey, you're the nerd brains. Tara, you've got some sort of magic mojo, okay? Our friends are in danger and the bad girl already knows we're here. Now, listen up. I have a plan. I'll be the bait. Zoe? Zoey. What is this? Zoey, clever girl. Zoey, give us the device. I need more salt. Zoey, down here. Zoey, sweetheart, are you there? Zoey! So, you know that we know that you know that we're here. We're done with the fun and games. We just want to make a deal and get our friends back. You can even keep the blond. - Hello? - You came. Yeah. Look, we get that you're all powerful and stuff. She's not listening to me. Come out to play? Actually, I think this has been one big misunderstanding. Anytime now, Zoey. Help me! Morgan! You don't wanna be special. Don't wanna accept what radiates of you. I'll take what you're wasting. I gotta get closer. Morgan! We need a new plan. Get up. Get up. Zoey, sweetheart, are you there? Zoey, don't go. Zoey. Zoey. My darling. How I've missed you so. You've got this, girl. I know you do. Don't let them take her. Don't you leave me. Zoey. I never left. I've always been there. You're stronger than her. Use your powers. Now, Zoey. Goodbye. Holy smokes, girl. That was crazy. Thank you. Are you okay? Yeah, I feel, maybe I should stay seated. Oh, my God. Thank you so much. - Did you see that? That was so scar... - Who is hugging me? No, no, no, no, no. That is the last time I'm saving anybody. My ladies! I had to save everyone. Look at my purse. You saved us. You did, didn't you? I thought that was pretty cool. Morgan! Morgan. I just kissed my unicorn. Whoa. Okay, there you go guys. There you go. Hey, hey. That was crazy. That was like so... I see your device worked. Yeah. And, hey, your necklace. It's my idea. - Thanks. - Yeah. Another caterpillar? No. Zoey! Dad. Are you okay? You sure? I'm just glad I'm a nerd to a nerd dad. I just really wanna go home. Yeah. Okay. Hey, neighbor kid, you coming? You need a ride? Yeah, yes. Yeah. This place is - super spooky. Yeah. - Okay. - Come over here. - Oh, ow. Okay. Did anyone notice how quickly it became day again?
