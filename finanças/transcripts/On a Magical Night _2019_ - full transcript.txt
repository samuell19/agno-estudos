Days pass by and weeks pass by Neither past time Nor past loves return Under the Mirabeau bridge flows the Seine The night falls and the hours ring The days pass, I remain Kiss my breasts. Like that? The other one too. Now my tummy. No. Out, hussy! No, Asdrubal, not hussy. Not to a French girl you like to kiss. You should say slut, little bitch, not hussy. Got it. Now... My cute little Pinochet. Sorry, guys, it's unbearable. It's too much. The mistress in the closet can be fun. I love a good farce. I was ready to wait, telling myself, ''Look where dating students gets you. You'll never learn.'' She's your teacher? Miss, your obscene simpering and cheap cooing is too much to bear. You understand, as a woman and a historian, I had to react. What teacher? History of Justice and Legal Proceedings. Don't blame him. I went after him on my own. He didn't charm me, I charmed myself. Because of his name. Asdrubal Electorat. The most erotic name I ever heard. My anthroponymic fantasies ruin me. Thanks, Asdrubal, I had two nice months. Two months? Barely. But three times a week. ON A MAGICAL NIGHT A shower before dinner? I was sweaty, I cycled back. Don't bring flu home. I'll wash your things. Thanks. She left me, thanks a lot Fucking you all winter was awesome I'll bang you in spring too. - Seen my phone, hon? - No. It's a horrible case. She dug up her husband to stop him haunting her dreams. She told the judge they weren't dreams, that he came and hit her every night. He'd been in his grave two years by then. Psycho-genealogy, more or less. Her dead husband wasn't a ghost for her. More a living trace. A secret she told herself. Hear a vibration? Not at all. Want a coffee? I'm sure I read about a corpse murder in a Henry James story. In The Ghostly Rental, maybe. Any idea? Where's Henry James? At ''J'', why do I find Maupassant and Mauvignier? Shit, Richard, alphabetical order isn't tough to understand. James is here now. The guy who fucked you all winter and is eager for spring, is he ''A'' for Antoine, or for Alex, or Asshole? Must we do this? You seem to want to clean up. It's irrelevant, believe me. Do I know him? ''A'' for Asdrubal, surname Electorat. Can we move on? You have a lover called Asbrabol something and you want to move on? It's nothing to get dramatic about. It was a bit of sexual fun, which ended today. Nothing that requires a long explanation. Your sex life is an extra-marital activity? We've been like siblings for years, my love. So, at times, like you I suppose, I have an insignificant fling. I never imagined such a thing. Don't touch me. You saw him earlier? Honey, we've been together over 20 years. No couple lasts that long without a bit of sex on the side. It's logical. It's how a marriage lasts. It's unavoidable. 2 and 2 make 4, the rest is nothing. I've never cheated on you in 25 years. Liar. I don't want to know. We're not competing for marital merit. A man never marries the right woman. No, that's not right. Sure, it's not right. But maybe I shouldn't have. Were we lining up to marry you? I forget. - That tone won't help. - My tone? Who's the woman you should have married? I don't know... Irène Haffner, say. It's ages since Ms. Irène Haffner got a mention. Yes... But she loved me, while you... What? Finish that accusation! Nothing, it's just... I've wasted my best years on someone totally dishonest. Those were your best years? Richard... Richard! Leave me alone. You and I need to think. Maria! Do you know what you really want? I want to be alone. Alone? Without me? Alone, that's all. Richard? I find your attitude unacceptable. It's sick doing this to me. Richard, how can you be so young? We can all be young at one point. But not stay it. Why not? I was 25 once and you loved me madly. This is absurd. What's going on? You should tell me that. When did you say you'd be so nasty when you got old? Look at the state I'm in. I'm sorry, really. I thought we agreed. I never knew fidelity mattered so much to you. I need to weigh things up. You told me to think. I can't think with you in the room. I'm mad with worry. Maybe you've left with Assdoobal for good. I'm imagining the worst. Well, you're mistaken. I'm not in someone's arms. I'm across the street, near you, to think it over. Are you leaving me? You threw me out. Let me come to you. Let's sort this out with fine promises. Wave to me, dammit. Certainly not. A night apart to think could do us both good. Your sonata? Yeah. After we wed, you stopped playing. Other priorities, I guess. When you played, I melted like sugar in tea. That's misplaced nostalgia. I loved your worried kitten look when you began playing. You loved other parts of me too, but you tire of everything with the years. I don't see why you stopped. I had my reasons. Meaning it was my fault? Don't discuss it with me. If my feelings worry you, a man across the street can answer. Go back to your room. I'll sleep here instead. - By you. - Crazy old woman. Stop calling me ''old woman''. It's cruel, seeing you young and feeling so disgusting. You're not disgusting. Well, your face is. Really disgusting now. But the rest is ok. Thanks a lot. I said the rest was fine. Try listening. I'll go back to my room. No, Maria... Look what you've become. You were sweet and passionate, now you're greedy and organized. What? It's pathetic, banging guys half your age. You're not free and merry, you're sad, cynical and coldly selfish. Life is utilitarian. Everything has its explanation to serve your well-being. ''2 and 2 make 4, the rest is nothing.'' See how your mind works now? Before, you'd have forced 2 and 2 to make 5. If they had, you've have found it... true and charming. How did you convince yourself only you matter? What an indictment. No, this isn't a trial, it's a heartbreak. How could I play for you? You don't play for a profiteer. What can music bring a woman like that? But it's none of my business. I didn't know I'd been such a let-down. Now you know. All right... Let's say no more. No, you're talking for once. This conversation won't go anywhere. It'll just hurt. Spare me that look! Let's sit here five minutes without speaking, ok? I did my best. Maybe. I don't think so. Quiet now. If you kissed me now, I'd let you. Not a good idea. Anything but a good idea. You had bad ideas before. You married me. I did that reluctantly, got it? All right. I've got it. We'll say I forced you. I hate how you're turning this around. I understand. You're allowed to hate it. I'm Richard's piano teacher. Hello. He never told you about his teacher at the conservatoire? Maybe... How do you do. Where's Richard? I wanted a look at you. It's sly, but I was intrigued. What could Maria Mortemart be? Why are you here? I'm Irène Haffner. His friend, Irène? He said I was a friend? No, not at all. He refers to you as ''the love of his youth''. But I imagined you different. Younger than him. A teacher younger than a student? I didn't know his piano teacher was Irène Haffner. Hold on... How old was he when you met? Yes... You may go, thank you. See you next week. Goodbye. Miss Haffner? I'd like to know... if being in love with you could expel me from your class or can I attend it all the same? I gave Richard classes at home, not at the conservatoire. A ritual fell into place. He'd go straight to the bathroom to take a shower. It was tea-time. I'd buy him an eclair. Then he'd play. We celebrated him turning fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, twenty-one, twenty-two... Then he told me you'd proposed. I already knew about you. Richard... That's our last kiss. Why? Because. You're marrying this young woman, Maria, and I wish you every happiness. You're worlds apart. You can't keep coming here. You're not that type. I can be that type too. I can act like a bastard. We'll carry on playing, kissing and fucking a bit. You must live your life. You're part of it. No, my boy, I'm an amusing part of your adolescence. All boys dream of having a piano teacher. - Should I go? - Yes, it's time. If I go, I'll never come back. It's for the best. Maybe you dreamt of having a student. Maybe. You're right. Richard was a rich brat with bad skin. I washed him clean of it all: the rancid stinginess of his world, his bourgeois filth, his genetic ugliness... I made him into a new man. Gentle, a book-lover, handsome, tender. I made the ideal husband. Before I could enjoy that, you ousted me. When he followed you, despite preparing for it, my life fell apart. A total collapse. No more joy, no more anything. I didn't expect such a massacre. You can be blind, unable to understand or even see, that our life revolves around one person. When you married, I swore never to see him again. Six months after we split up, I vanished. I moved to the north-west coast. This morning, I began living again. Why awaken the past? Because of you or thanks to you, everything seems possible again. What if it were my turn? What if you gave back what you took? Will I get a second chance? What is all this? Richard? Irène, I spoiled our love for a woman not worth it. I should've stayed with you. My best years are gone, but you can have the others. Richard has invited me back into his life. May I cross the street to go to him? You want that? You'll leave me. You know I can't live alone unlike you. Was marrying me a mistake? Tell me. You say nothing? - Answer! - I'm thinking. It doesn't take that much thought. What? You smoked a lot. I quit? Good job too. I have to smoke at the window now. You mean to tell Irène I'm a killjoy now? Let me have one. Me too. You don't smoke now. Your pals are ''mister''. ''How's tricks, mister?'' You make corny jokes. You sleep in your briefs. You have a passion for everything German. I'll take good care of him. Will that Richard still want you? He tends to forget his past. Let me decide for once. I'm ready to risk it. We can mend our mistakes. I wasn't the right man for you. I don't agree at all. You're my perfect husband. And Assdoobal? Don't make such a fuss about Asdrubal Electorat. I lapse once... Maria! We have a long list. A list? A list of what? Who listed all my lapses? Mum? I keep the list. Reluctantly too, dear. Why're you here? Your mother isn't welcome? Mum, you're dead. So what? That won't shut me up. Shall we stick to the lovers after you married? Sorry, Richard. Perhaps you'd rather go? A few names won't change things. If only it were a few. So... From the most recent... Asdrubal Electorat, Karsten Schubert, Gurvan Le Bellec, Samir Barich, Amin Boué, Léonor Cambremer, Issakha Kanté, Albert Himes, Pierre Mortemart... What? Her cousin? Yes, poor Richard, summer 2001 in Brittany. That's enough! Spare me this. I screw who I want. Ok, I often want to strip strangers naked, but I'm not the Devil. I never abused anyone. Anton Granadas... - Léon Jones. - He refused. Alexander Leach. What adult bangs a cousin? Everyone does. - Hannibal... - Shut up! Why? We can talk about it. Apparently, there's no shame in it. Do I ask how many men you had? How many makes you a saint and me a slut? That's irrelevant. You wicked girl! You slept with more men than all the women in our family together in over five generations. Mum... Let me handle this my way. How can you say Richard was the man you needed when you needed so many more? Go ahead. Console my husband for his adulterous wife. You're in for a surprise. Don't be discourteous. Let her go. We'll see how you react. However I find you, I'll take time to mend you. I hope I won't disappoint you. I need the code. The entry code? 4372B. What is this shit? What is this trap? - Don't open it! - Shut up! Cut it out. What a pain. - Put me down. - Enough. How did I fall for you? You're such a shit. Hello. Hello, Richard. Shit, Irène. Why didn't I recognize you? You haven't changed. Don't flatter me. I know I'm not like before. You're exactly like before. How can you be so young? You find me that young? Ok, I admit it. I had some work done. Here. And here. It's not too obvious? Not at all. It's like I saw you yesterday. Believe me, we didn't see each other yesterday. How old are you now? 60? - May I come in? - Of course. I was sorting stuff. Lived here long? Twelve years. I bought it when my parents died. I didn't know. They died in a car crash. 160 years combined. A happy end, I guess. Yes. We all hope for that. What? A happy end. Come with me. I'm sorry. It's a mess. Irène, how did you find me? Totally by chance. I'm in Paris for the weekend in the hotel opposite. Crazy, isn't it? I saw you over here. I recognized you. It was silly not to come and say hello. The hotel opposite? I thought you'd be pleased. I am. You were right. It's so unexpected. You're here now, no different... Still got a piano? Yes, but I don't play. It's still in tune. No child's bedroom? We have no children. You wanted four. Maria didn't agree, so no children. Maria... Maria. She isn't here? She'll be back soon. Are you happy together? There've been a few glitches in the contract but we're ok. Caused by you? It's never just one person. None of my business, sorry. Got anything to drink? Richard? Yes? I was at the hotel, but that's not how I found you. Really? No. I lied. Actually, I met your wife on the street and she told me about you two, you poor dear. What did she say? You've split up. Why did she say that? We haven't. Maria seemed sure. She can be very deadpan. You misunderstood. She seemed convinced, but maybe I'm wrong. How did you recognize her? You've never met. So you think. What do you mean? When she proposed to you, I got in touch with her. Whatever for? I couldn't abandon you to a stranger. Maria understood that. We've stayed in touch since. She gives me news of you both. A New Year's card, stuff like that. She recommended the hotel. You met behind my back? She was in the hotel lobby to tell me what had happened. She'd just left? Yes, with her travel bag. She said she was leaving home and that you'd probably be happy to see me. She gave me the entry code. 4372B. There. That's why I dared to come. Are you ok? I don't feel good. I'm kind of lost. You're very pale. I'm totally lost. But why? What's going on with Maria? Let's forget about her. Come on. Sit at the piano with me. Remember our stool? I can't play anymore. I can. I want to play you Scarlatti. It'll wash you clean. A brief sonata to make a 25-year silence in your mind. Sit next to me. Bring me one of Maria's cigarettes. I want to smoke. One of Maria's? Maria, your ex-wife, she smokes. - Mind if I open the window? - Not at all. Open the window. Open it wide. Let Scarlatti fill Paris. Wasn't that due to happen? It was, but it makes me uneasy. It's a bit late now. That slob touching her makes me sick. That slob is you. I know, thanks. It's hard to accept, even for me. No reason to panic as yet. You're hanging back. Don't worry, she won't. I won't resist long. Isn't that what you wanted? I don't know now. You don't know? After I offer you your teenage love? I think you should go back. It could end badly. It's getting unhealthy. I'm not going back over. What do you mean? I'm fine over here now. She has you old, me young. Everyone's happy. We'll live happily that way? Think about it. Want to go back to the 90s? You're crazy, old woman. It's true. Think I'm going mad? No, I'm here. Who's he? Your will, the one that guides you. My will looks like Charles Aznavour? He looks like Aznavour? Just yesterday, I was 20 caressing time and playing with life See? May I come in? This is pretty. What's this thing? Bravo. I'll sit here. Thanks, but I may not need you. Let me sum things up. You land your old husband with his teenage love and first mistress while you sleep with that husband, but at the age he was when you met, a youngster. Still handsome. If you like, yes. Why should anyone care? He's your husband and you prefer him at 25 to 50. Exactly. Surely you can cheat with your husband? - You're lecturing me? - Not at all. No, I'm not Pinocchio's cricket. Someone else handles your conscience. My role is to strengthen your resolve. In short, to say ''Go, girl''. I see things that way. ''He looks nice, I'll talk to him.'' Yes, I rarely prevent such things. I turn the light green. Especially if he's pretty with a tight butt. Was Aznavour gay? Irrelevant. I live alone with Mother... Couldn't we hope for better from you? - Really? - He wants to trap you. Wouldn't less desire and more principles be fairer? Do we know what's fair, my boy? Don't call me that. You seem to have the petty mind of a boy. I'll slap your mind, honey. Don't start, boys. I need clarity. Let me think. What's that? Our baby. We have a baby now? Quiet, you'll make him cry. Come on. Come on. He has your eyes. He's our child? Yes. The second one will be here soon. And the third. And the fourth. I'll give you everything, everything I should have given you. I shouldn't have let you go. Forgive me for being so foolish. I was proud. How did I think we'd be happier apart? I've brought your return ticket. I've come to take my place where I left it. - But I'm married. - No. Maria has left. It's just us and a bright future. The future told me I needed to come back. That I had to. That your pretty smile was for me. Why keep smiling for someone who no longer loves you? I feel I can't think. Having me outside your head can't help. So what do I do? Ask him directly. - There's something I can ask? - Always. Left or right, stop or more... Today or tomorrow, Diet Coke or normal... - Why don't you love me now? - Not the best question. If I were you, I wouldn't ask something like that. But I can convince you to ask him. Why don't I love you now? Right. - You're running off? - I'll leave you together. I won't be far, don't worry. Maybe my body has changed and your desire too. Right? Cos of my ageing organs. My eyes see less. My ears hear you less well. My hair vanishes, my teeth rot, my skin wrinkles. My soul too. No reason it shouldn't age as well. If you no longer love me, maybe I took too many blows and you hate seeing me down and helpless. I probably didn't complain enough about all those blows. You thought I didn't care. That I liked myself like this. That my battered body would do for us. It's not true. I don't like myself. You can't say Maria and I don't love each other. It's simply not true. If our skin touches for a second or two, we'll be saved. Nothing will matter... Our wounds, our rages, the depth of our loneliness, a single touch, however light, however fleeting, revives us, everything breathes again. Her hand on my neck, my head on her shoulder, and the chemical reaction immediately occurs. You're talking of a memory of love, not of love, Richard. Not of love in the present. Love in the present has no meaning. Love is always built on memory. Love is always a place chosen together. A past. The past of the first moments and palpitations. The first day we knew we were in love. You keep the memory alive. It's not the present. The past arouses the confidence of love. Maria, stop it. What used to happen spontaneously requires more stimulus now. You know what I mean. We only make love exceptionally, after a drink or two, after an arousing scene in a movie, or for rituals we respect like birthdays or New Year. Along with sex, we hid a ton of things from each other. We grew apart saying we knew each other by heart. That led to disaster. It happened in two ways: gradually and suddenly. The distance between us can seem insurmountable. Too far to reach across. It happens here some nights. After the lights go out, we barely say ''good night''. Darkness reigns. I stare at the ceiling. In the silence, I tell myself if I open my hand and touch her, her whole heart will open. And it kills me because I can't. It drives me mad, I swear. But at that moment of madness, when I imagined the worst, the miracle occurred every time. I'd always feel Maria turn over and edge across the mattress towards me. She presses her behind to my belly, I extend an arm... My fingers seek her hand on the pillow and we lie there like two tiny spoons in a drawer. We can fall asleep, afraid of nothing. Neither of death, nor of our love dying. Are you sure of that? Asdrubal, what is it? Maria. Finally! You can't stay here. No, I need to talk to you. Capital thing to say. Call me. I left 200 messages already. What's your room figure? No. I can't do this now. You have to go. Room 212. It's ok. He won't stay long, I promise. Yes, we promise. So who is who? Amin? Hello. Pierre, the cousin. It's been ages. Gurvan Le Bellec and Karsten Schubert, from 2004. Quite a leap between them. Anton. Anton, of course! The bakery in Aix. July 29, 2007, the day Michel Serrault died. Room 212. That doesn't ring a bell? And madam teaches law. Article 212 of the civil code: ''Spouses owe each other respect, fidelity and assistance.'' No, not you. You can't lecture me on fidelity. You're all gross. How come? If I'd known you were married... How dare you bring this guy here? He needs to talk, maybe about his studies. I'm his teacher after all. His future is at stake, so calm down. Richard, trust me. The elevator... Stay with her. Don't waver. Relax... All in the other room. Pierre? Come here. Your cousin, idiot! - Sorry. - Move. Hi, I'm Leon Jones. I wanted to say nothing happened. I wanted to, but I get lost in a threesome. Not now. Let me handle it. Maria? Come in, Asdrubal. - Who's the man with you? - Don't start. He's a close friend. He's like family. He'll make sure we do nothing stupid. - Can I speak in front of him? - That's why he's here. I need you, Maria. I won't leave you. Let's make a fresh start. Certainly not! Hold on, let him plead his case. You're the woman of my life. I keep crying. I can't live without you. - Come to Valparaiso. - No! I need to feel you, touch you... If I don't kiss you, I'll die. You're in perfect health. You really must go. I desire you! I want a life with you! I'll write your name in the sand, show you the whales! No. Sorry, but no. Stop, he's my husband! Your husband? Your husband or a lover? Answer me! Want to break my nose too? How many are we? A lot. There's a lot of you. I'm a countless number of men. Let me tend to my husband. I'll be in touch. See you at your exam. No means no, Mr Electorat. We'll see the whales. Just look at you... What a fighter. Don't make fun, ok. I won't. Sorry, I didn't think he'd punch you. He caught me off-guard. What would you consider the cardinal virtues of a successful marriage? I see your game. I'd choose loyalty, humour, desire, sharing. Then again, I'm not like you. I've stayed single. Maybe time changes things. You never married? No, Richard, I couldn't. Being together so long is a profession. It requires demands, skills... The opposite of blindness. What happens between us now? I'm so happy to see you again. We could see each other. And have dinner now and then. Richard... You have to be frank. Do you feel the same thing as me? Is it yes or is it no? You say nothing. It's no. I'm such a stupid cow. I thought... it would be possible. That we get a second chance. What an idiot. You fell in love with her 30 years ago and forgot me, that's all. Why did I come? Now I'm hit with the truth you no longer desire me. You love another woman, is that it? No, only Maria. Maria, all over again. Do I look terrible? Never mind. Fetch the child. You can leave him. You didn't say his name. Make your mind up. I'm sorry. No name needed now. Come on, Irène. You forgot me. It's that simple. You forgot me while I was hoping for you to return. What's this child? What's that? Asdrubal? Yes, look after him. Wait for me! Irène! Wait here. Maria, come back! Don't mind me. Come back! Come on then. I'll wait for them. Say again? I'll wait for them. Coming or not? No. If you change your mind, ring the bell. Maria? You know, Asdrubal, you and I need to have this out. What happened? Irène. Talk to me. I'm sorry about this. Keep him, he doesn't want me! Let me go back! No, I can't abandon you, Irène. Whose is it? This child... You had Richard's child? No! Hello. It's all right... Can I come in? The door's open. It must hurt. Did Maria do that? No. I'm not really ready to talk to my wife's lover. I'm not her lover. Sorry? I don't get it. You don't sleep with her? I do, but I'm not her lover. Try to speak a bit more clearly or this won't work. I'm not her lover. You're not her lover? No. But you sleep with her. Yes. - With Maria. - Ok. It's nice being made fun of. I know it's the cuckold's fate, but I may not take it calmly. Thank you. I'm sorry. No, don't be. It's my life, not yours. It's over for me, your turn now. I'll head back to the coast and live while waiting to die. I don't think you can vanish so easily. I do, I know full well what awaits me. Are you sure? My future isn't bright. You've no idea how dull it is. Nice and clean. Yes. As a new pin. There. It's open here. It's funny, the right side of your lip, your nose and your right brow got hit, as if the blow first swerved, then straightened. Very surprising. So, do you recognize me? Never seen you. Cut it out. Try harder. What? I've never seen you before. Give me a clue. - Don't you recognize me? - No. Forget it. It's amazing. It's incredible. You're totally crazy, I adore you. This isn't a good idea. - It is. - No! Let's see your fate. I know what my fate is, ok. Cute. Sure it's your place? Yes, I still know where I live! Come on, run. Why are you here at my house? No idea who I am? It's me in front of me. Who are you? The wife of Richard, your old student. I was very pretty, wasn't I? What's that? The baby Richard and I didn't have. Maybe we weren't supposed to have him. You have no regrets? No. I never felt my life was wasted without this child. I've lived without children. I didn't miss that. I spoiled it by letting Richard go. Rubbish! We thought that for a few months, a year maybe, but then we lived differently, another way. But look what we've become. What do you mean? Life's good here. The sea's so beautiful. I'm so lucky to have this house in this wonderful place. It's beautiful, full of love and friendship. We lost a man we loved, but life continued, thank God. I swear I can't live this life. Sand everywhere, the loneliness... Trust me. We were right. It was best to leave Paris and start anew. You'll be a woman you don't know. For that, you need to take the child back. Can we live without loving? Love will be here. It'll come from the sea. Its form will surprise you. Stop weeping over our fate. You think we deserved better? You're wrong. Nothing else was written. We took control and made a great life. I don't believe you. - Really? - No. Which of us looks unhappier? All right. Well? The man of my dreams? Who said it was a man? What are you implying? I'm happy to meet you, Maria, finally. Staying for dinner? Sorry, my husband's waiting. You're still married to Richard Warrimer? How is the lucky devil? Do you still love her? Sorry, that's a bit... It's ok. Asdruc, that Maria should be as adorable as I guessed at 22, that's a miracle because... when I fell for her, I knew nothing of love. I was just smitten. Will you accept a lover now and then? Yes. You're sure? Yes. As long as it's you and no one else. You darling. That's my beautiful life? Lesbian by the sea. We never know what can make us happy. And your beautiful life? Do you still love him? - None of my business... - It's ok. Richard says you still love each other. He's so romantically complacent. - He is, isn't he? - I realize now. How can your husband know you so badly? Maybe women live too long. How do you mean? With such a life expectancy, we're bound to be disillusioned. So when should we die? 30? 40? That's not long. What did you want to call the child? I never thought. - Shit, what are they doing? - Let's hide. Drop the cigarette! There they are! Where? There. Wait. - Why hide? - I don't know. It's decision time. Why must we decide? Police, open up! Final warning before we smash the counter! Ladies... Very cosy. I came here with Asdrubal to... Asdrubal? It was simpler. I'll explain. - What? - Nothing, kitten. We wanted to tell you we love you both and want to marry you. You're already married. You're right to point that out. We're married, that's right. But the two of us want to marry you. - Three of you? - No, four. What do you think? - Or five? - Or six? - Seven? - Eight? - Nine? - Ten? - Eleven? - Twelve? Is that reasonable? No, let me. Gentlemen, respect this solemn moment. It's serious, not just sex, we're talking marriage. Scram! All right. Carry on, Richard, pal. So, what do you think? What? They need to talk. Yes. Nothing to say? Is this little gent ours? He could have been, but no. I need to see to something. I want to smell his sweet skin... Don't do that, Richard. He has to go back to the nothingness before birth. Can't I keep him a bit? Maria... No. Stay here. Stay here. I behaved horribly with you. With me? I doubt it. My grandmother was right, I'm wicked. I won't have you thinking that. No way. What can I bring you apart from grief? Grief? Since when do you bring people grief? Stop listening to old ladies. Let's have a drink. Let's have a drink. How can we talk about anything else now? You gave us quite a night. I did what I could. May I ask you something? How long have you been living on tiptoe with me? I forget now... Never mind. I love you. Kiss her. Go on, kiss her. Maria! I'm getting croissants. Got time for breakfast? Or we can go to a café. Sorry, I have a class. I spent the night at this hotel. We slept near each other. Yes. Will you be home tonight? If you want. I'm free tonight. Subtitles by Ian Burley Subtitling: HIVENTY
