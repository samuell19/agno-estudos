He suddenly appeared on the race track, and signed up for the 100m hurdles race. Hey I know about this too. His speed is extremely fast. That university student is so hot. Please I beg all of you. Let me have him? I'll be the first in line. Yeah if you're counting from the back. Hey keep it down. Or else Sensei will come. You're sick. Hey do you hear a knocking sound? What's that? Scary! Someone's coming! Akiba-san. Where are you? Akiba-san. Please answer me. Yes? Pack up your things, you're going home. Yes I understand. Hanai-sensei will go with her to Tokyo immediately. Taxi's here! Akiba-san. Listen to me carefully. In Tokyo, your family had an accident. You should go right away to the hospital. Let me carry that Sensei. Tokyo Ansai Hospital right? Yes please. That... accident. Is it a traffic accident? I'm not too sure of the specifics myself. All I know is that everybody in your family was hurt. I think the field trip will have to be changed because of your emergency. No. I'm spending the summer vacation with my family. Maybe I should invite the whole class to my home? Do you need to make a rest stop? Let's go together. Yes please. What the hell you looking at? You've got to be shitting me. Excuse me. It's not Ansai Hospital anymore. It's been changed to the University Hospital Do you know where it's at? Yes. Do you have a map? Drink some. Here you go. I heard that your aunt is waiting for you at the hospital. OK. From here take this street. This street? Yes, and then straight to the hospital. I wonder if there's a faster route? What? Hold on for a second? It's not a traffic accident is it? Just what happened? Are they all dead? Who's still alive? Please don't ask me. I don't know anything. All I know is that your family had an accident. Is it my dad? My mom? Or is it one of my brothers? You're worried about me so you're not telling me. Changing hospitals... Is it because they couldn't be saved? I want to know now please tell me. Forgive me Akiba-san. Can I... close my eyes for a while? That's right. Getting some sleep would be good. Why are we taking this street? I told you to go on the other one. It's OK. Why didn't you follow my instructions? I told them to you exactly. I'm just following the map. My responsibility is to take her there as fast as possible. I have my own responsibilities too. How can you act on your own like this? Sensei. There's no hurry. Because... it's already too late right? So there's no hurry. Miss. We're here. Including road tolls... 68 820 yen in total please. OK. Kako-chan! Listen to me. Something scary has happened. Your dad... Your mom... Tomo-kun and Nao-kun... They're all... Don't look. Please don't look Kako-chan. Soon the Supreme Court will render its decision. You... It would be good if back then... I was able to kill. About that... Leave! Kako! Here are your photos. Thank you. When did you take them? Where were you yesterday? I was working. Working. What are you a cop now? You could've at least given me a call. You're worry too much. I dread the day that I won't get to see you again. Yeah you'd lose all your appetite. Damn you're annoying! Damn puppet hag. What's wrong with you!? Let's have lunch together. Yeah sure. Kako. Remember what we talked about before? He said if it was you then he'd meet up right away. Mama said, if the Literature Department has any pretty girls then bring them. Don't the other departments have any? What're you two talking about? We're talking about the cinema branch. We need a suitable candidate to defeat Sensei. That's right you can go. No you can't. Sounds like your mother here won't let you. Yeah. Hold on. Even if I weren't your mom I wouldn't let you. Akiba! My notebook. I forgot it. Wow you're really something. Sorry. Give it back tommorow. The girl sure has a lot of influence. That's so true. Let's go. I'll wait for you at the door. OK! You've grown so much! I hardly recognize you. Thank you for your concern. I shouldn't have dragged a 13-year-old you into the Tsuzuki report. I regret doing it. No. I read it. It's well written. I knew you'd read it right away. Next week the Supreme Court will render its decision. I predict Tsuki will get the death penalty. You wanted him to, so you wrote this didn't you? Yes. I have a request. I want to meet his daughter. For what reason? To get to know her. Why? To see what's different between us And what if she's living a better life than you? You won't be able to handle it. I just want to meet her. Why did she say it would be better if she was able to kill? If I see her I wouldn't use the information I have to harm her. I don't know where she lives. You're lying. You've reminded me of something, something I've forgotten. "As Tsuzuki was sitting in a pool of blood," "with tears from his eyes he cried his daughter's name." "What kind of life will you have now? "Your dad has made you the daughter of a murderer." "Sorry. Sorry." "I went to Tsuzuki's daughter's home afterwards," "and would ask a lot about her father," "and she would always answer my questions." If the Supreme Court is rendering its decision next week, you would go see her again. In the end she said this to you... "It would be good if I was able to kill." Why? Between the two of you, your hair is different, your faces are different. And yet, The energy and feeling coming from you two, are identical. What is it? Excuse me. Does Tsuzuki Miho live here? She moved. Moved to...? Does it matter? Wherever she goes she's still trash. Let me help you. Sorry. Ice Storm. Ice cubes. Hey high school student. Do I look it? Let's have a drink. Can we? Come on! What're you playing at? You're just a high school student! Sensei's getting mad. See, you're pretty cute when you're mad. Hey, go over there to drink. Come on, she hasn't even said anything yet. I said leave! I'm so sorry. Miho. Sorry about that. He's just a little twirp. Do you live nearby? Yes. University student? Yeah. From the film school? Oh...yeah. I just visited there last month, pretty interesting over there. Have you done this job a long time? Not at all. Not even 2 years. We're about the same age aren't we? I'll be 20 soon. Same here. You look like you're younger. Yeah? Are you from Tokyo? Yeah. Wow this is strong. This drink has fast results Hello. It's the death penalty. Oh Aunt. Just now the Supreme Court notified me that it is the death penalty. Really... Are you alright? Yeah, I am. After reading that magazine's report, I wonder what's going to happen next. When the debate starts, I'm afraid there's going to be more trouble. Thank you. Come visit us sometime. Sure, say hi to Uncle for me. Thank you very much. Excuse me I'm from a Tokyo film company. May I ask you about your thoughts and opinions on the film just now? Sorry. Hey please. Can you come home tonight? What's wrong? You look horrible. Did something happen? OK OK. I'll try to come back early today. Hey hey. Have you ever thought about being a model? This looks good. Not bad. Come on let's talk. Following the restructuring, administration fees have increased, leading to an increase in revenues. But top management points out, that even though revenues have increased, after deductions and costs total income would be a net loss. Moving on, the man convicted of the Wasamaya family murder 8 years ago has been sentenced to death. The supreme court rejected the 49 year old Tsuzuki Norio Hikoku appeal. When Tsuzuki Hikoku was first sentenced he had already asked for an appeal. The murder occurred in May of 1996 in Tokyo. 4 people in total were killed, including 2 young children. The oldest daughter was on a school trip at the time fortunately and was not at home. At 1:30 this afternoon the hearing began. The Supreme Court upheld the ruling that Tsuzuki Hikoku be executed, and rejected his appeal. The judge pointed out that while he considered the extenuating circumstances that lead to the murder, multiple weapons were used during the crime and, in the shortest amount of time, the cruelest methods were used to kill the 4 victims. This severely affects the community and constitutes a horrific crime where only a death sentence... When I heard the children's sharp cries I felt intense pain. Like hitting my head on a nail. The pool of blood at my feet got larger. Facing the two boys, I made myself lift the hammer. Tomo-kun. Nao-kun. You must've been terrified. I'm so sorry. I'm the only one left. I'm so sorry. I'm the only one left. Welcome. Were you working late tonight? It is a little late tonight isn't it? Can I still hang around a bit? Please. What do you do? I take surveys at the movie theater. And collect the audience's reactions and opinions. Oh I see. Here is the new design for the bar. Hmm but our budget isn't that big. I didn't think of that. Go ahead and change it if you want. OK then I'm leaving first. See ya. What happened here? Oh when I was doing this I got hurt. You play golf? Yeah. What'll you have? Oh yeah. To compliment such an honoured guest, I'll make it for you myself. Well then up to you then. Please go ahead. Ice Storm. It's sweet and delicious. Humans... After we're born the first memory we have is taste So, when the day is over you should drink something sweet. To go back to your childhood. Then maybe you can start all over again tommorow. Start again... tommorow. What's your name? Can you tell me? Yeah. Do you have a pen? Yu... Kako Tsuzuki, Miho. How do you read this character? Yuko? It's "kako". Kako-chan. It's a birthmark. Oh is that what it is? Your body comes from your parents right? Parents eh? Sure is lonely. What? Tonight you're alone. What's so special about tonight? Because today's Friday Then it's the weekend right? Right. You're so lucky to watch movies for free. I'll take you next time. Yeah! I'll come. I'll call you then. Can you tell me your number? Oh I forgot. I've never went on a date with a girl before. Kako. Miho. I'll take the taxi home then. OK. Akira! My husband. You're married? I'll wait for your call. Goodnight. Tsumaki please. Tsuzuki Miho. Wasamaya family murderer Tsuzuki Hikoku gives up appeal, sentenced to death. It's not a bad movie but... The motive for the crime is a little... Too complicated. The motive for real murders are simple. Right? Probably. He looks pretty hot in a suit. Does he work out? This... Boxing? He's a scout for a company. You're lucky Kako. You can work in the movie industry. You're the one who's lucky. You're the owner of a bar living pretty well. No I'm not that good. I've been unlucky ever since I was a kid. What do you mean? I'm a scary person. Everytime I meet new friends, I would first tell them, if the find me scary then they better get out of my sight. I'm the daughter of a death-row inmate. That's me. I'm the daughter of a death-row inmate. That's me. He's already been sentenced, my dad. Murder. He killed 4 people. It started around 4 or 5 years ago. It could also be because I inherited something from my dad. Anyways... It seems like I've inherited his crime. Inherited? Think about it. It's like your blood type. Crime and punishment. They're passed along to the next generation. Police. Is your mom home? No. Everything in this house will be confiscated. Do you understand? Do you have any family nearby? My grandma. That's... - My dad's. - You better call your grandma to come. I heard that in the family that got killed there's a girl that's about my age. It just so happens that she was on a field trip and was lucky to be away. I heard about that too. Ever since I transferred schools I would tell everybody my dad is a murderer. Everybody would always say it's not my fault. Then after a while they would always disappear. You want to leave too probably. Yeah. I need to go to the toilet. It doesn't bother me anymore. Does he know too? Of course he does. Not long after I met him I told him. The only one who wasn't scared off is probably Akira. I've wanted to ask you before. What? Don't blame me if I'm wrong. Sure. The wounds on your face and arm. They came from a beating didn't they? Who did it? Thank you. Ow! "It would be good if I was able to kill." Well, let me help you realize your dreams. Akiba-san. Where are you? Pack up your things, you're going home. Akiba-san. Please answer me. Your family. It seems everybody in your family was injured. The field trip may have to be changed. It's not Ansai Hospital anymore. It's been changed to the University Hospital. Are they all dead? Who's still alive? It's not a traffic accident is it? Changing hospitals... It's already too late. So there's no hurry. Miss, we're here. Kako-chan! Listen to me. Something scary has happened. Don't look Kako-chan. (4 Hours Later) What's up with you? Kako. What? Your phone. Hello. Is this Miho? Help me What is it? Help me. It hurts. What happened? Who is it? It hurts. So much. Where are you? I'm coming. Who's looking for you this late? My friend is hurt. I'm going to check up on her. Miho? Who's that? I'll be back soon Want me to come too? It's OK. Kako. I wanted to tell you before You... When you sleep, you always cry. Dad's spirit hasn't left yet. People who are murdered are always like this Does this thinking work? When I was hallucinating Dad was able to come visit me. I felt so lucky. I liked it. And I want to keep living. Kako-chan You no longer need to come here. After today, anything may trigger your hallucinations. The hallucinations of your experience of those 4 hours that night. Regardless, you can still live a normal life. Your therapy is over. Miho. Are you OK? Can you hear me? How'd you get here? You called me. Have you forgotten? You need to go to the hospital It's OK. It's just my face. But, how did you know I live here? You told me just now. Aw crap... You look good this time. Oh manager you're horny. Come on! Keep it down. Hey there's blood. Oh I got hit by my woman. Remember? The one who's dad got the death sentence. Just because her dad got sentenced it now she wants to sentence me to death too. Yeah? Scary. Hey I know a good place. - Yeah? - Come on let's go He's probably with a girl right now. If it was me, I'd have confronted him a long time ago. It's too late now. We're already married. I just need to put up with it. How can you put up with this? It's still abuse. What's the big deal? Compared with my dad. That family suffered 100 times more than me. [8 Years Ago Family Murder Tragedy] Tsuzuki. How is it? It's delicious. Akira said even when I get beat up I can always laugh afterwards. Still can laugh. You're not afraid? He said I deserved it. Help me help me. It hurts. Stop it. I sound like a kid crying. Weird eh. I heard there were kids. What? In the family that got murdered. They probably cried too. Yeah. Probably. Your husband is a goddamn bastard. Inhuman. He should die. Sentence him to death. Sorry. Confession statement. Cell 1-351. Tokyo Holding Facility, Tsuzuki Norio. This writing will not change my death sentence, and I don't intend to beg for my life. I just want to describe my motive, And the murder weapons that I used. I'll try my best to write down that day's events. In addition, I want to describe my state of mind right now. My wife did not have any dreams in particular. Now, this child has stopped crying. She lost her mother on her own birthday. When I think, about how she'll never have a happy birthday again I... From now on, for this child, I'll try my best to take care of her. Please everybody. Like you always have before, Take good care of her. Thank you. This man, crying for my wife, touched me. Thank you for coming. Please. Does it feel a little better now? Yes. My daughter's better. She wants to go to school. I can finally let out a sigh of relief. I came today to discuss business. But you just lost your wife. I hope you don't blame me for being insensitive. No no. I'll feel better if I have work to do. Then I'd like to ask Mr. Tsuzuki to do me a favour. There's no downside for you. He's a director of a preparatory school in Kansai, and he's looking for a guaranteer for his wife's loan. "If we both become guaranteers," "after his school develops into Tokyo," "we can get our share of the dividends." That's what Akiba told me. Mamasan. Thank you. They just started today. Have a look. Nice to meet you. - My name's Hana - Hana-chan Yeah. Thank you. That's nice. Why? I'm the only guaranteer of the loan. And it's a 50 million yen liability. That director doesn't even need to pay a cent. I only understood it when I read the contract. That's because my company has other liabilities. So I lost the eligibility to be the guaranteer. I can't sign for the loan. What should I do? It's OK. Just use your wife's life insurance. After that leave it to me. Don't you have a mansion somewhere? I don't need to use my wife's insurance if you mortgage your house. No. That house is my life. It's decided. We'll need to request the high-risk loaner to raise the interest rate by 1% to 5%. I think the president of your company, who doesn't want to lose me as a client, will agree. This additional 1% will go into your bank's accounts. That's illegal. That's a joke. It's just to help another person get a loan so we're borrowing your wife's insurance. I want to see this director. Impossible. He's recovering from an illness. What's so bad about this? I admire your loyalty towards your company, and feel ashamed that I don't have your honesty. Tsuzuki-kun here is going to use his late wife's life insurance to help another in need. How admirable. He is a charitable person. That's incredible. He truly is a good person. Hana-chan should learn from him. I'll try my best. I can't forgive this bastard. I must set things straight. I started my detailed planning to exact my revenge on Akiba. Turn your head. Thank you. I want to find a job, but it doesn't look like I will. In this commercial world, earning money sure isn't easy. What do you think? Probably. Yeah. Why are you here? I thought you would probably be around here. Oh good. Sorry for not visiting your bar for so long. Are you free? Yeah. Let's go over there. Kako! What about the discussion group later today? You go! I wanted you to spend the day with me. I just turned 20. - It's your birthday? - Yeah. Congratulations. For my birthday my mother wanted to cook something nice for me. She asked the hospital for a leave, and shopped like crazy at the grocery store. She slipped on the stairs after and hit her head. She had a disease where her blood didn't clot. Even a small wound was fatal. My birthday became the day my mom died. So every year today I have no mood for celebrating. Hey what happened? I went to the hospital. You got hit again? Get up. My baby. It's gone. Take this! Please stop kicking me. What about it? It hurts. You deserve it. Call the police. No. My dad... Your dad is your dad. If you explain it to them. Enough. I want to sentence him myself. Sentence? He killed my baby. By my own hand. How will you sentence him? You want to hurt him? He's a bastard. - I know. - Inhuman. - I know. - But you still love him. You said it yourself. No matter how he hits you, you'll still love him. You can't stop. - I... - Still thinking about killing him. What a strange way of thinking. People who kill sure are strange. Only strange people kill. Don't you think? It feels like saying goodbye. Like you saying goodbye to your dad. I finally understand. Understand what? If you do it. Then do it exactly. Before I really didn't know how to combine hate with guilt together But now I understand. Kill him. But, you can't let the police catch you. Kill him. That bastard. Take your mind off things. Try to be happy today. OK. What is it? I have something to tell you. Something that I've kept from you. It's you again! I have to leave early you guys. What's that supposed to mean? Hello? Where are you? Shinjuku. I'm heading for work. Take your time. I've thought about it. If I kill him, I'll need an alibi so that I won't be a suspect. That day I thought you were acting strange so I was just put it out there. If I get caught by the police. I won't tell them you were involved. What are you talking about? You said it yourself. This kind of person deserves to die. Sorry I have to go now. Why don't you come to my bar anymore? You seem to have time to play with them. Where are you? Over here. What a coincidence. A female customer wanders in drunk just as we're closing, and asks me for a drink while I'm cleaning up. It's no good. I've been to your bar too many times The police will know that just by asking around a bit. No they won't. Why? Kako will be an illusion. Illusion? She won't actually exist. I'll need to testify. Yes. You'll prove that I was at the store at the time of death. - So I'll need to testify to the police - No it won't be you. Then who? Goro-kun from the bar. With your help, there won't be any problems. I have something to ask you. What? Back when they were investigating your dad, he confessed immediately. He said he knew he would face the death penalty. That's right. But in the end he appealed. Why? Even though my dad killed the little kids, it's still was very painful for him. He couldn't remember anything back then. But, he knew he would face the death penalty. But he still appealed and requested a new trial. The court did a psycological evaluation on him, and concluded he was fit to stand trial. My dad was driven to madness by that couple. He couldn't handle it anymore. That couple? The Akiba's. They were the ones who caused my dad to go to jail. They died because of vengeance. Dad would say, because of this, it would be nice if I was able to kill. You heard me. I've inherited Dad's vengeance. And started to hate that couple myself. What? You also think that they deserved to die? How will we prove you weren't there? It all depends on that illusionary woman. Is this Akiba-san? Are you free now? Please don't hang up. I'm very busy right now, I'm in a meeting. But about that matter, can you reconsider? That matter? Mr. Akiba you need to join as a partner. At least, guarantee half of the 50 million yen. Tsuzuki. Are you stupid? Why are you forcing me to do this? Didn't I tell you before? The 5% in your company... I'm not just some employee at your company! All you can do is tough it out. I believe in you. Hang in there. Let's begin. OK. 1:30 AM. I'll let Goro-kun go and practice his drums. And on the way tell him to ask about the bar renovation. After he meets with the band members, he will phone back to report. After he leaves, I'll enter the bar. And I'll be the one who receives his call. Then tell him that you went out to buy some smokes for me. This'll work. I can't take it anymore. Can't take it anymore. Not anymore. When I started, I had no intent to kill. I would've been satisfied if I could just take from Akiba-san what he took from my late wife. I'll wait for you at the office then. You bring her there. What are you doing right now? I want to see you. Can't. Why? I miss you. You can't see me. What do you mean by that? Kako. Tsuzuki Miho is that murderer's daughter! I'm going. I'll be there by 1:30. 4 hours from now. OK. Kako. Are you OK? That time. I beg you. Kako. It's OK. I'll wake up in 4 hours. Just let me rest. I won't be late. Hey! What's wrong with you? Kako. Kako, Kako hey! That... Accident. Is it a traffic accident? I'm not too sure of the specifics myself. You're lying. Kako. Are you OK? Do you need an ambulance? Do you need to make a rest stop? What? Are you really OK? Kako. Can you hear me? It looks like you can. Yes I can, but you can't hear me. Kako. I'm going to go ahead then. I'll make him wait for me outside. Are you listening? Sorry but I have something to tell you. I slept with him again last night. To let somebody I will kill tommorow hold me, isn't that crazy? I must be despicable to sleep with him even after my miscarriage. Can you hear me? I can. If I'm pregant again from last night, how can I face my child? A child who killed his dad. It's him who made me do this. I've inherited my dad's hate and punishment. I'll pass it along to my child too. I hate Akira. Which I have passed along to my child. Don't cry. But, I've turned into a monster. A monster who even my child would hate. I've finally got the punishment I deserve. Nobody's wants to punish you. Lethal injection. It takes a few minutes before your heart stops beating. And then you lose conciousness. And your body would hurt for a while. Therefore, I want to put my ear up against my dad's chest. To listen to my dad's pain. If it's very painful, then everybody would be satisfied. And I wouldn't feel so guilty. No. There's no such thing. Only like this will I be able to start over. To keep living. I want to be able to hear my family too. Even if it's just their heartbeats. I just want to listen to one of theirs. From now on I have to keep living. I'm still living. Sorry. I just wish everybody will forgive me. I just wish there's somebody to encourage me. "Even if you're alone," "you still have to keep living." I... I wanted to make a killer's daughter kill. To have you commit my revenge for me. So I told you to kill Akira. I should go. Don't go, Miho. Come to the bar at 1:30. Don't go Miho. Don't. If I don't see you, I'll do it alone. Are you sure you're OK? I'm leaving then. Sorry sorry. Damn you're fussy. Sorry let's go. From now on I have to keep living. I'm sorry everybody. Can you forgive me? Miho. Where are you? Miho! Hello. I've brought her near the apartment but she's scared. Can you come down for a bit? Wait for me. I'll be right there. Goodbye. Miho. Ice Storm bar please. Who is it? My name is Tsuzuki, I have some business with your husband. My husband's not home yet. I have something that I have to give to him today. I see. Please wait for a moment. Kako. Is he dead? It's going to be a while so take a rest over here. There's supposed to be 5 people in the family. Let's begin then. This house means everything to your husband! I'm going to tear it down for him. I'll tear everything down! Do you have $50 million? Your husband is a bastard. He stole my late wife's insurance money, to help his friend get a loan. If only I lent money to you, then I can use the company's funds. Isn't that a little overboard? Director? He's still alive. Miho! That's enough. I have to kill him! Please. Stop! This endless loop of revenge and killing will never end! Nobody wants to punish you! End this. When you hit him did he see your face? I hit him from behind. Let's go. Who is this old man? He's... my father. Father!? It's all your fault! When I was passing by, I heard somebody calling for help. And when I got to the apartment I saw somebody's been hurt. I couldn't see too clearly... I'm back! Mom! He stole my things again. - It's mine! - It's mine! - Gimme! - Gimme! I just told your mom, that your dad did something very bad to me. When people do bad things, they must be punished. Understand? You're mother was a part of it too. Therefore she was punished too. Mommy. I have no recollection of the next 30 seconds. When I came back to my senses, The 2 boys were lying next to their mother. Hello. It's Goro. Sorry for calling so late. I... The owner went to buy some smokes for me. It's there's anything important I can tell her for you. Yep. I'll tell her. OK. I'm back. Hey! What happened? What are you doing? Why are you dressed like that? What have you done!? And like this, he died too. What are you looking at? What? Those eyes. After spending so much time with the family, My whole body became numb. Please believe me. After I was arrested, and was being interrogated, I told them numerous times. I am sane. Miho. Forgive me. You're back. I sent the divorce papers yesterday. How is he? I heard that he'll be out of the hospital in 2 weeks. The police came many times. In the end they figured it was a rival agency's doing. Actually I really want to do more with you sometime. The next time you come and see me I'll treat you. Kako. What? Please don't blame me. The thing I want to do with you. What do you want to do? Don't laugh at me. If you do I'll get mad. (Do you want to delete Akiba Kako?) (This contact has been deleted.) Goodbye. Kako. (Do you want to delete Tsuzuki Miho?) - (This contact has been deleted) - Goodbye Miho. Subs by brainz@FSC
