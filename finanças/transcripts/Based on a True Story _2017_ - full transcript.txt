Hello. It's for Myl?ne, my cousin. She's crazy about you, I love you too. Your novel moved me. What it says is so true. Thank you for everything you do. Thank you. - Hello. - Hello. I'm so happy to meet you. I loved your book. It's for my daughter. - What's her name? - Justine. It is for her 37th birthday. I'm sure she will like it very much. It's beautiful. Thank you. - Hi, Delphine. - For whom? It's for my mother. It's her birthday and she's a huge fan of yours. - What's her name? - Nathalie. She talks about you continuously. It's absurd. - Thank you so much. Good day. - Thank you. Goodbye. For Jeanne. For Jeanne. I have been in the hospital for a long time and your book gave me an incredible hope... that despite the disease, despite... all we have been through, my children perhaps could love me one day. - Thanks. - Thank you. - That's enough. That's enough. That's enough. - Enough? But there are other people. Gentlemen, I'm sorry, but for today it's all. She's here since this morning at 8.00am. Just one more. For your most fierce fan. They will get back in line. If you do it discreetly, nobody will notice. If I do another, I'll collapse. I swear I'll sign it. I took a long trip to get here. - Do I have to come? - Just show your face and then you can go. - I'm exhausted. - Just a few minutes. - I only do it to make you happy. - They came for you. - Who? - Dealers, foreign publishers ... - Karina. - Just a few minutes. - Delphine. - Thanks, Oriane. Cheers. Leonello Brandolini what a pleasure! What a nice evening! Hello, how are you? Mrs. Dayrieux, what a pleasure to see you. - You do not remember me, do you? - No. I'm Leonello Brandolini, your Italian publisher. And thank you for your book. And what a book! Is gorgeous. You made me cry. But sales do not, those do not make us cry. Tell me something... I'm sorry, for earlier. It does not matter. This is a difficult book for me. - I'm happy to have met you. I admire your work. Sometimes it seems to me ... that you write only for me, that you read my thoughts. - Do you have the book with you? - Of course. - And this is to...? - To Elle. - Elle (her)? - Yes, diminutive of ?lisabeth. Thank you. A glass of Vodka? Why not? I'd like to know how you work. Do you take notes or use a recorder? I take notes. In the notebooks. - I always carry them with me. - Always? Yes, they give me security. - Can I see them? - See them? Quiet down, I do not want to open them. I have four. One for the book I'm working on. Two for titles or ideas. And this is for personal things. It must be hard now. The success, the comments, the reactions of the family ... The sudden limelight. I guess it's on the verge of collapse. Of the collapse? It seems a little exaggerated. And yet, despite everything, sometimes you will feel alone. - Yes? - Are you ready? - Not at all, I'm destroyed. - I'll take you to rest. How was the party? You did not miss anything. Yours? I was stuck with Amos Oz and Sollers. Then there was a reception ... I left early. I met an interesting woman. Do you like women now? Stop that. We talked all evening. It was nice. She's a good listener, she's very careful. Good listeners are rare. - What's her name? - Elle. - Yes, what's her name? - I told you. Elle. - She's called Elle? - Yes. Diminutive of ?lisabeth. - May I? - Of course, Raymond. - I saw the car. - Do you want a coffee? No thanks. I brought you a cider. Oh, thank you, you did not have to. Very nice. So cute. I have Delphine's book. I'd like it if you signed it for me. Sorry, I should have thought about it. Here. My wife also spent a difficult time years ago. She was also hospitalized. It seems like your story. - She did not commit suicide. - Thank God, no. No, now it's fine. Thank you. Good... See you then. - Don't you want to stay? - No thanks. - Good day. - Thank you. The boys are suffering. - I miss them. - It's normal that you miss them. But you are more free. - To come here? - Also. I meant to write. Research for months. - You should start. - Research is a large part of the job. I know you... It takes time, of course. But you are hesitating. It's a big step, a new adventure. I will spend two years with these characters, it's normal. - What's normal? - Reflect, ask questions. Do I really want to do it? Are they really so interesting? What if I was wrong? Things like that. - Do you think you're wrong? - No. Not at all. I'm ready. I'm happy to start. "It's easy to turn your life into storytelling changing some names. Do you think you can go back to your usual good life? It's too late. Your mother's slaughter made you break through. Pay the family saga well, eh? You're making big money. So send the check, thank you." - Hello? - Hello. It's Elle. It's crazy to call like this. I did not know if I could use your number so soon. I gave it to you. Yes, but people do it so as not to be rude. Are you free... for a coffee? Yes, why not? - Sorry if I bothered you. - No, I'm glad to see you. - Hello. - Hello. - A Tariquet, as usual? - Yes thanks. I talked a lot about myself, but I know nothing about you. - I'm not an interesting person. - In my opinion, yes. But you are not obliged. Thank you. I write for others. That is, they pay me to write the lives of others. Actors, politicians ... You write and they sign. An invisible literary species. The ghosts of celebrities. So you choose your customers? You mean "my patients". And now who is your patient? A TV presenter. Last summer we did 30 hours of interviews. Now I'm trying to turn them into a book. And do not you want to write something about yourself? - On me? - On your life. Oh! My life is a mortal bore. My husband died many years ago, I live alone. No children. By choice? However, it is not a regret. We make separate lives. It works like this, between us. I am afraid of habit, of compromise. How life can be after a few years together. People envy you a lot. Did you search me on Google? Not need to Google you, everyone knows it. Everybody knows? Yes, you're with a TV presenter. He was criticized for inviting you. Should I be banned from your program? - People are envious, it's normal. - Normal? Many writers would like to be invited. Me included. Heck, I had forgotten. I have to run. I have to see myself with my publisher. - The bill, please. - Yes. - Where is it? - At the sixth. I'm going that way, I'll take you there. - Your children are gone? - Yes. They left me. Paul is in an art school in Belgium. And my daughter wants to get into civil aviation. She is studying in Lyon. Your daughter wants to be a pilot? Do you imagine? It's my stop. Hello. Shit, my notebooks! Hello? Of course I am at home. You see me? Really? Where are you? I do not see you. Incredible. When? Saturday? I'll let you know if I'm free. Thanks anyway. - Hello. - Hello. You look beautiful. Am I the first? I thought I was late. Not at all. Congratulations. I had said no gifts or flowers. Forgive me, I'm sorry. I forgive you. I will open it with the others. Wow, I'm impressed! Do you cook for two days? Unbelievable. Someone from the family? I think so, but maybe it is not. - You'll have some ideas. - Actually, no. Your next book: After. After what? After your last book. The consequences, what it caused, what it revealed. I have been working for months on a novel of realistic fiction. Oh, Delphine ... Realistic fiction, really? You are far beyond this. Take a reason. They will not come. It'll be just the two of us. - We'll still wait a little bit. - No. - Call, so we'll be sure. - No, it's a waste of time. - But, you talked to them, right? - I sent a group email ... as I do every year and they did not come. At least, open your gift. I'm glad you came. You can not understand how much it means to me. After my husband's death, his friends stopped answering me. I keep inviting them, but they never come. Do you know why? I can not talk about it, I'm not ready. One day, I'll tell you. It is the synopsis of the book I would like to write. Take a look. I would very much like to have your opinion. It's very crowded. Mrs. Dayrieux, I am very happy that you could come. - The pleasure is mine. - Good evening. I have a surprise for you, come. Come. We know the reduced version from the cover of your book, but I thought it deserved to be seen life-size, in its entirety. I must apologize, I have to go to say hello. I will be right back. Good evening. Seriously, let's go. - Do not you want to wait for Karina? - No, I have to go. All right? Hello? It's me. Did I wake you up? Yes, more or less. I'm sorry to call you so soon, but I have a big problem. - Do you have a recorder? - Yes sure. Would you mind lending me right away? It's really urgent. Here it is. I'll show you how it works? No, I have one like that. I do not know how you can be impeccable in the early morning. - I would never be able to. - Of course yes, all women can. I do not believe. How you see yourself and how others see you... Are two different things. So, what do you need this morning? - A coffee with cream and a buttered baguette. - Very well. Thank you for trusting me. I read it very carefully. - The characters are still sketchy. - Yes, yes. But I believe that the narrative arc and the structure are solid. - I think there is some material ... - I liked it a lot. - Yes? - Seriously. Ah, thank you very much, it helps me. I needed feedback before ... - I think it works. - Before I get to work. - Here you go. - Thank you. Last night, I made love with a man in a hotel room. At 05:00 or 06:00 I dressed and took a taxi to go home and... - I had forgotten the keys. - Do you have a duplicate? Yes, but the maid arrives at 11:00. And first I have an appointment with a politician in the National Assembly. - I started working for her. - It's interesting? Fascinating. No, I'm joking. Come, I want to smoke. You know, Delphine... I want to be honest with you. At the cost of looking a little... A bit brutal. I lied to you first. I find your synopsis without interest. I do not mean it sucks, it's just not interesting. It has nothing to do with you. It would be a big mistake to waste time, just because ... you are afraid to write what you should write. Of course, if you talk to your publisher, it will tell you it's a great idea. They're not crazy, they have to put some money back into their coffers. Let's not delude ourselves, they do not care about anything else. Even if your book is bad, however, they will succeed in trimming it back to a few thousand readers. It annoys me to leave tomorrow morning. Leave yourself alone. - Are you sure it's okay? - No, my pleasure. - Elle helps me a lot. - She? - What do you mean? - I can talk to her about my work, of essential questions, of very intimate things. Sometimes I have the impression that she destabilizes you. Not at all. Well... her opinions may be a bit too radical, but ... even if I do not always agree, it's still stimulating. It forces me to clarify my convictions. Look. She bought me some new notebooks. It worries me. You're writing? Not exactly. Not yet, but it will happen. When will you return? I'll be in Texas first to meet Cormac McCarthy, then in Los Angeles for Bret Easton Ellis and Joan Didion. You have the chance to meet her, I love her works. Then I will have a few free days before meeting Don DeLillo in New York. In all... I'll be away for three weeks. And then you will have finished? After there will be Ian McEwan, but it's in London, it's easier. They offered me a third season. But I refused. I do not want to be away from you for so long. "It's a burden ... be in your family, share your name. Now it's a real burden. The name you appropriated and dragged into shit. I'm part of the author's family and it pisses me off. I heard you got rid of your children. Well done. Now the field is free, isn't it? I know you're a bad mother. " - Hello? - I received another one. - Another what? - Anonymous letter. Another one? Poor! - But I meant Facebook. - Facebook? - Your Facebook page. - But there isn't. I do not know how it works. The matter is very serious. Do not move, I'll be right away. Ok, I'll wait for you. What is this Facebook story? There will be a page of mine, but I have nothing to do with it. There is a page in your name, even if you did not create it. And anyone can post something. - Your password? - louisepaul222, all lowercase. - Why "222"? - I do not know, I did not set it up. Someone in your family has posted abominable things about you. Listen. "She's a disease who destroys everything around her, she is dangerous. If you had a person like that in your family, you would commit them like her mother." - Turn off that thing. You're wrong, it's very serious. Anonymous letters are one thing, but an attack on social networks is serious. Really? People believe more in slander than in truth. Then it is useless to answer. Your readers do it for you, they defend you. - Not everyone, I guess. - Not everybody. And then they get angry with each other. Listen. "Why all this hatred? Read something else." And the other replies: "It's shit, people love shit. She's a media whore. She would do anything to be in the spotlight. Look at her partner. She only cares about money. She would sell her family for money. And they call that literature ... " - Turn off that thing, I beg you, stop. I'm sorry, but it's really too much. I am destroyed. I understand you. Do not worry. I'll take care of everything. This will help you relax. What is that? An anxiolytic, Xanax. Only half a milligram. Thank you. I'll give you another one tonight. - How are you? - I'm torn. How was the night? Bad, like yesterday. I woke up at 4:00 am in anguish. I could not get back to sleep. Did you take another Xanax as I told you? I took two. I was able to sleep between 8.30am and 9.00am. - louisepaul222, right? - Yes. How long have you not checked your inbox? Good. We will start by replying to your emails. Then... To all the proposals, for the editorials... ...to the readings, I will reply that you are busy with the new book, that you are flattered that they have chosen you, but that you need to concentrate now. Is that OK? And... I will add a closure like that... "Do not hesitate to contact me for a next time, I would be delighted." What is it, a high school in Tours? Have you made a commitment for the next week? There are three classes that work on my book. - And? I promised that I would give a talk on the writting craft. How is the speech proceeding? I have some notes, well... some notes. Some notes... There are three messages from the high school librarian. It seems rather unpleasant. She says: "Students are happy to meet you. Could you send me your train times? As I told you in the previous email, I need to know them to organize students and book a room." Then she begins to be impatient. She says: "In the absence of a response from you I would like to remind you that 200 students await you next Thursday 9 for a meeting on the theme 'The Writing Craft' to which you have agreed to participate. Thank you. They are studying your books. " It's really annoying. I do not know. What are we doing, Delphine? - We have to answer. - I will go there. - Are you sure? - I have no other choice. The coffee. I found some notes for the speech at high school Tours. - Actually, you had them trashed. - Really? They were nothing short of mediocre. I started again. Do you want to take a look? Are you well? Everything's fine with me. Save my life. I'm happy to help. If it allows you to focus on important things. I have concerns too. In reality... I rented my apartment. The owner worked abroad but had to return urgently. I have to go. Can you host me for a week or two until I find something else? Since the boys' room is free ... - Of course. Do you need all these things? No, but I do not know where to put them. Basically it's all I have. And then, there are my documents. No, those are too heavy. An elevator would have been convenient. We tried, but the condominium has not approved it. You can use the shelves, I also freed the wardrobe. I fix everything later. France Culture, for the interview. Fourth floor. - Who is it? - A journalist from France Culture. You did not tell me anything. I do not tell you everything. What do you have to talk about? Of my first book. On job anxiety. Haven't you talked about it enough yet? - Hi, thanks for the invitation. - Imagine yourself. - Damien, the sound engineer. - Hello. - Take a seat. - Thank you. Thank you. Do you mind if I open the window? For the noise of the city. - Go ahead. - It seems more lively. Do you know how it works? Let's talk about a new novel and insert it into today's society. Do you remember how it started? I remember perfectly. I was on the train. It was raining. I was going to work. It was all very lugubrious. Was it easy to tackle the theme of work in a novel? Actually, at first I did not want to talk about the world of work, but of urban solitude. I wanted to describe the characters in everyday life. Lives destroyed, solitary ... Nothing very romantic. What was gloomy about your work? I was in charge of social relations in a company. It consisted of understanding social relationships ... find the solution in conflict situations. I do not think you want to know more. Thanks again for inviting us. The program will air on 21. I will send you a message for confirmation. - All right. Thank you, goodbye. - Thank you, goodbye. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Then? Have you made a new friend? All this staging to see you reduced like this. "Back to fiction"? What do they care? Who is she to be able to give judgments? Are you serious? Are you having a jealousy crisis? Forgive me, but to see you waste time makes me angry. That woman is dragging you towards the bottom. Only I know who you are and what you are able to write. Only you? Can't you see I'm terrified? And are at a standstill? You piss me off with the story of the hidden book. There is no hidden book. There is nothing behind the curtain. No taboos, no treasure, no secrets! There is nothing! Look at me, I'm transparent! "This answering machine knows how to make you talk." Paul, honey, what's up? Do not you love your mother anymore? Call me once in a while, I miss you so much. If you see your sister, tell her I'd like to hear from her. A kiss. Take care of yourself. - Mom? - Yes, it's mom. - I wanted to remind you that I exist. - Stop that. - Before you called me every day. - Work, mom. I'm so happy, I did my first solo. - What does that mean? - That the instructor makes you fly alone. - Under his control? - No, he's not in the plane. I was alone. It was the most incredible thing I did. You can not imagine it. I will tell you. Yes, you will tell it to me. We'll talk. Kisses. - You're back. - You're going out? Yes, I'm late. But I'm making progress. You left a mess! "It's been a long time since you've written any more? - I do not know. It happened gradually. Do not worry, we will find a solution. But you have many requests. Come translated everywhere. It's incredible. I told everyone that you're not in Paris. Could not you say I was not in the mood? Nobody needs to know what kind of mood you are. "Begin by selling your mother and then go out with a TV presenter to do promotion. Congratulations, you had to do it. When he leaves you, I guess you'll write us a book full of crap. You have caused so much pain and so much damage. And do you know why? Because people believe what is written." It's someone who has hated you for a long time. It is your book that has enabled all this It's the last one? Yes. "Because people believe what is written." And they are right! Why would they be right? And who are these people? People can go wrong and say bullshit. Look around. All writers use current events. And why, do you think? Because it is the only valid source. You want to go back to fiction for one reason: you refuse to write your hidden book. Stop that, with my "hidden book"! Sorry if I insist. But I reread the interview. Read it on the Internet. Maybe I'll write it one day, but not now. My work took me elsewhere. Where? Where did it bring you? For me, it did not get you anywhere. What are you doing here? - I heard you get up. - So? So? If my presence is a burden, tell me and I'll leave. I'm sorry. I did not mean that. Are you okay, Delphine? - Yes I'm fine. Then go to sleep, because tomorrow you leave early for Tours. No, I'm not fine. I know it will be a drama, but I can not go there. I do not have the strength. - Do you want me to go in your place? - Are you kidding? Not at all. - Would you pretend to be me? - Why not? Despite all my photos on Google? There are many, with many different expressions. - Are you serious? - I'm serious. Wait up. > Keep. Try this. I was on the train. It was raining. I was going to work. It was all very lugubrious. I was in charge of social relations in a company. It consisted of understanding social relationships ... find the solution in conflict situations. I do not think you want to know more. - Is not it too early for you? - No do not worry. - I was awake. I have good news. - Which? James Ellroy accepted a meeting. His French agent confirmed this. I am happy for you. How are you? I was worried. I did not hear from you. I left you some messages. I'm fine. And nothing else? I'm fine. I understand that you need to be alone, to protect your work and that you can not talk to me about certain things. But that's too much. It's dangerous. - Let me help you. - Come back, then. You know I can not. It is impossible to communicate. You are locked. We're not at war, I'm not your enemy. Sometimes, I wonder if someone has taken possession of you. Delphine! - Oriane. - How are you? - Sorry, I had my head in the clouds. - Yes I know. You are immersed in writing. - Do you live in the area? - No, in Montreuil. We went to the pediatrician and promised her a ride on the carousel. - Mom, can I go? - Yes honey. Go, now I'm coming. Do not go alone. Watch only. I followed your instructions. No interview, no autograph, no trip, I blocked everything. - Thanks, but ... - I was impeccable. After your email, you have not heard from me. - I can not wait to read your book. - Which e-mail? You had written to tell us to leave you alone as you finished the book. It's true, I'm sorry. I'm really focused right now, I have to stay a little alone. But I will see again soon. - I have to go. Good luck. - Thank you. Then? A total disaster. They unmasked me. The cops arrived and they accused me of identity theft. And now, I'm on probation. Come on, stop joking. It went very well. They did not suspect anything. Think about it, we're interchangeable. I can do it again when you want. I'm sure it works with your friends too. I'm ready to prove it to you. - Is it your old diary? - Have you peeked in my things? No, it was there. You were lucky to have written it. I started at 12 and I quit when I had my children. - 15 years of memories, stories and portraits ... - And teenage rants. - They are your memories. - Not of my best years. Why do you look for something else when you already have this? - I'm not looking for anything. - You must face reality. That's enough! I can not stand it anymore. Stop bothering me. Nobody cares about this. - To your readers, yes. - It only matters to me. There is no perspective. At best, it's boring, at worst, distressing. Building a perspective is a form of fiction. So why wait? - To do what? - What you're talking about! I'm sorry for yesterday. I had received bad news. I had to write Depardieu's autobiography. Do you want some? I've never been comfortable with men, but Depardieu intrigued me. Yes, it's in another dimension. Just before signing, I knew he had met someone else. A man, obviously. And the book was taken from under my nose. I felt betrayed. On the other hand, I understand, male solidarity and the rest. - Who is it? - Fran?ois. He will not be coming back for now. He had to accept the third season. Maybe you need it. - About what? - A little bit of distance. You are fragile. He's certainly your companion, but it always hosts and rewards other writers. I am not jealous. Not that way, anyway. One that crosses the Atlantic to meet writers whom he considers more interesting than the French ones. Or am I wrong? No. It's partly true, but I do not think ... It will not help you find your safety again I am honored that you make an exception. What you mean? - Your email. Did you see Oriane? - I do not remember writing it. I did not invent it. "Dear everyone, as you know, I have writer's block. This failure leaves me disoriented. Please do not contact me and do not send me invitations. I won't be giving any news while writing the book. Thanks for understanding." You wrote it, right? My mind is in turmoil right now. Thank you. I was starting to worry. I made tea. I got you some Bourge Rouge from Mariage Fr?res and some macarons. - I have to tell you something. - No, I have to tell you something! You wrote to my friends asking them not to contact me. Of course. I did it to help you focus. You will not be exaggerating? You should have asked me. I'm here. Is that not sufficient? - I can not believe. - You need peace and solitude for the book. Which book? The hidden story that you owe to your readers. Listen to me. I never wrote to please anyone and I will not start now. You are responsible for the love you have aroused. And what the hell do you care? Stay out of it. Do not tell me what to write! Who do you think you are? I found a hotel. They will come and get my bags later. - No. - I see that my presence is a burden. I was hoping to help you regain security. I'm sorry, I was wrong. - Are you alright? - I hurt myself. Do not move. Stay still. I'll be right back, do not move. Delphine! "Fracture spino-tub?rositaire" (tibial spine fracture) Congratulations. It could have been worse. When I saw you... I was scared. Four weeks like this ... who can make it? Why do not you move in Fran?ois'? It would be easier. He's abroad, I can not go alone. I need to rest. I'm exhausted. - If you want, I'll come with you. - Are you sure? Yes, I have to write too. It's perfect. I will need a few things. Clothes, bath products ... I'll take them. Give me the keys. - I'm happy to see you up and about. - In a manner of speaking. - I have your shopping. - Do not worry. Thank you. The strawberries have gone bad. - If you need me ... - No, I'm fine. Thanks for your help. - Nothing. Come on! - Thank you. What a shitty weather. Like when I met my husband. I was stuck in traffic. Someone knocked on my window. A handsome guy in a leather jacket. I unlocked the door and he went upstairs. What did he look like? Tall, robust, with a beard. Very virile. I liked his smell. A mixture of wet skin and tobacco. I would have felt uncomfortable. I wanted Jean as soon as he entered. I approached an alley and went to a shabby hotel and we spent a night of passion. How old were you? 19 and him 28. He was a mountain guide, then. He had even climbed K2, but... he had an accident and was forced to stop. Later he worked as a courier, barman... He also wanted to be an antique dealer. He would have done everything. It's all clear now. The way we met and how she came into my life. It is obvious. It's about Elle I have to write. But you talked to her about it. God, no. If I do, she will not talk to me anymore. I will let her come to me. Be careful. You told me she was dangerous. Of course, I will be cautious. I want to write about real life. Hers looks like a novel, not mine. But you need her to open up, you said she's very private. Yes, she will come with me. I'll be smart. I call you. - Will you bring me a coffee, please? - Ok. - And an M&M's. - Are you Delphine Dayrieux? - Yes. I am the librarian of the Balzac high school in Tours. Yes sure. - We felt bad for your visit. - Yes, I recognize you. No, I don't think I've ever had the pleasure of meeting you, Mrs. Dayrieux. But when I came to school... You have some nerve! - Do you not remember? - No, I do not remember, Mrs. Dayrieux. Because you never came to visit us. I'll allow myself to refresh your memory, who did not even have the courtesy to warn us or apologize to us. We will no longer encourage our students to take an interest in your writings. I wish you a good evening. - What did she want? - Nothing. Only an admirer. We had to spend a month in an alpine shelter. Then he changed his mind. It was my fault. - Your fault? - He was taking care of me, but I insisted. It's my fault. - We are not responsible for others. - No? I'm not so sure. One day, a storm broke out. - Were you alone at the shelter? - Alone, yes. Bored to death. We read a lot, we stopped having sex. The wind that blows incessantly for days makes you crazy. Finally it subsided and I went out to get some air. Alone? He did not want to come. I was walking in the woods when ... I heard a shot behind me. I went back to the shelter and there ... I found his body. His head had exploded. There was blood everywhere. It's terrible. It's been a long time. I was alone after my mother's death. - Then there was the fire. - Really? The whole house went up in smoke. Fortunately, I had a friend. My best friend, Kiki. Kiki? You never talked about her. - No? - You said you did not have any friends. In reality... Kiki does not exist. I had an imaginary friend. Kiki was a pretty girl with red hair. I dreamed of running away with her. Where nobody could have bothered us. - Yes? Already standing? - I did not hear you. - I've been awake for a long time. - All right? - Yes. Good. I let you work. We are here. It's going as I hoped. - She's biting it. - She is? She thinks I'm focused on myself, she confides in me. It does not follow a temporal order. They are fragmented episodes. I have to connect them together. I would like to register it, but it is too risky. - I have to hang up. - What do you want for lunch? - What you want. It's a little too early to say, but... I'm taking notes for a new book. - Really? - A very personal thing. A risky, very private thing. - Do you mean an autobiography? - Yes. I can not say anything else, it's not sure yet. A kind of confession. I can not even use the computer or take notes on paper, but ... the recorder is ideal. - Is it your hidden book? - Yes. It will be difficult. But you were right. It's time to face it. I never told you, but ... my mother also committed suicide. I found her on the floor in the corridor. With her yellow flower dress thay I liked. I was 4 years old. I curled up next to her and stayed there like that... For hours. It's February 7th. I'm starting to write again. Openly, if necessary. She opened up yesterday. She told me some of her memories. It's a start. I have to win her trust. I know how to do it. She had an imaginary friend. Kiki. She wanted to run away with her. Kiki told her that they would have a new life. The whole house burned, went up in smoke. Tall, robust, with a beard, virile. They were alone in the shelter. She found him with his head exploded. Can not you stay still for two minutes? Now, however, you're good. Or I'll break your other knee too. ELLE (her) Tell me who you are writing about. No. The secrecy clause is longer than the contract. - I will not tell anyone. - You'll let it escape. Who is it? An actress? A politician? At least tell me if I'm close. A singer? An athlete? Catherine Deneuve? Kim Kardashian? Rocco Siffredi. Imaginary friend Kiki We close them, no? Mice! - A mouse. There are mice here! - I get it. Did you see a mouse? I saw two running towards the basement. Calm down, it's nothing serious. Come on. Sit down. Take it easy. We will get rid of it, we will buy traps. It's nothing. Can you close the basement hatch? I left it open. Pass me the crutches, please. I had to go to the city to the market. Traps, rat poison. I took everything. We will exterminate them. The shop assistant was very kind, it's just... Just, what? You will have to do it. I will not go down there. Sorry for everything... it's a real phobia. - I did not come back empty-handed. - I can't see that! Usually, I like lemon, but your sauce is delicious. It's nothing like that, it's a simple American sauce. - I could not prepare it. - Do you want more? No, thank you, I'm full. I've already eaten a second serving. - I'll open another one. - At this point ... My father... he was draining three a day. When my mother died, I stayed alone with him. It scared me, he was violent. He... He... All my flaws come from him. He locked me up, literally. When he died in the fire, I finally felt free. - What happened? It seems it was an arson. - Who set him up? - They never took the manager. - Do you have any ideas? In my opinion, it was Kiki. I'm preparing fish soup for dinner. Soup? Great. You said you like it so much. You're burning, we have to bring down the fever. Hello? No, it's not Delphine, I'm a friend of hers, Elle. We do not know each other. Where is it, excuse me? I'm hearing you very badly. In Wyoming? No, she's in bed. She has food poisoning. Nothing serious, she will call you back. "I'm starting to write again, openly, if necessary. She opened up yesterday. She told me some of her memories. It's a start ... I have to win her trust. I know how to do it. She told me about a fire ... but she does not want to tell me anything else. I'll get it out of her. She said that the mother also... " - I made you a broth. - I'm not hungry. - My stomach hurts. - You will not heal, if you do not eat something. I can't. Try again. - Please... - Try it. Please, please... That's enough. Leave it there. I'll eat it later. I'm sorry for making you a broth. I made you some hot chocolate. I can not call Fran?ois back. If it's important, he'll call him back. - I want to inform my children. - It's done. You must drink. You did not eat anything. Be reasonable. Force yourself. Enough with the whims, drink. Come on, drink! Delphine! - Delphine! - Yes. - It's Raymond! - Yes. - Delphine! - I'm here. Yes. Guys! Guys... Come and see. Hey! You frightened me. Explain to me. Does anything have to do with me? Is it my fault? Is it because of all my travels? I took the first flight. You were lucky. They found you in time. Why did you want to kill yourself? I did not want to do it. The analyzes show a cocktail of sleeping pills and thallium sulfate. Basically, rat poison. Does this mean anything to you? But do you remember talking to her on the phone? Did not it seem strange to you that she answered? Delphine, you must believe me. I've never talked to Elle, do you understand? - I understand. - Never, it never happened. Ok. I kept calling, but the phone was off. Off, get it? - So I called Raymond. - Raymond? Raymond, the neighbor. He knocked on all the doors and windows. - Was it Raymond? - Why didn't you answer? - Because she had poisoned me! - All right. All right, don't believe me. I believe you. Sorry if I made you wait. Come. Come in and take a seat. I am enthusiastic! It is provocative, captivating. Your best job ever! Karina, I haven't written for three years. I did not send you any manuscript. - But I received the manuscript. - Someone else wrote it. Elle! "A work of fiction that will make you dizzy ..." Based on a True Story (after a true story) I'm so happy to meet you. I'm really impressed. You're a part of my life. I love your work and this last book is... - Who is it for? - For me, Delphine. We have the same name. I can not wait to read the next one. Hello, Mrs. Dayrieux ... To Elle.
