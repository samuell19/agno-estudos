Lonely White Sail Production Studio "Soyuzdetfilm" Moscow 1937 It was 1905. The first year of the Russian Revolution. A wave of strikes and stoppages rolled out across the whole country. The events took over the army and navy. On June 14 the Battleship Potemkin revolted, surrounded on all sides, the rebellious ship broke through to the sea and headed for Romania, but was disarmed by the Romanian authorities at the port of Constanta. The Potemkin crew illegally returned to Russia to continue their fight against the autocracy. Slip the cable! Slow astern! Dead slow astern! Stop! Bring it back! Stop! Gently forward! Please do not worry. First and second class passengers, I suggest you go to your cabins. Others don't leave your seats. Come on! A search. They're looking for someone. Disgraceful! Children! Let's go. Ugh! What a stinker! Who are they looking for? Someone set fire to the landlord's estate. They say it was a sailor from the Potemkin. The people are rebelling. They're looking for that runaway sailor high and low. - Dad, I want to go on deck. - It's not allowed. Sit up properly. - Pavlik, where's the piggy bank? - It's here. I'm bored! A fellow has exams coming up and he's bored! - Learn your poetry. - I've already learned it. - Learnt it specially, ask me. - Come on, tell me! - Recite it? - Recite it then. "Lone White Sail" a poem by M Lermontov. A lone white sail through haze on a pale blue sea! What does it seek... What does it seek on a far-off shore? What’s left at the harbour quay? Not bad for a melon. Eh, Pavlik? Good melon. Wind shrills, waves in a reel, The masthead creeks and sways… Eat, Pavlusha. - Well? Huh? - Very tasty! Alas, no course for happiness, Nor flight from that, alas! - Dad, some melon! - Carry on. Below, a stream of sapphire light, With sun’s gold light on the helm… Unruly, though... Who are you? Vacationers. It's not enough that you're vacationers. Who are these "vacationers"? Show your passport. How dare you talk to me in that tone? I am a secondary school, collegiate adviser Borscheev. These are my children! Piotr and... Pavel? You are rude and ignorant, get out of here! I'm terribly sorry, Your Excellency, I mistook you for someone else... Right... It can depart. We're moving! We're moving! Well, thank God! Let's go. The gendarmes have stayed ashore... Pavlik! And there's uncle. Look, Pavlik! Look at that beautiful bird. Where's the bird? Oh, my God, how stupid you are! There it is, there. No birds. Dark. Daddy! Be as quiet as a mouse and don't let the cat out of the bag. Where's the bird? Show me the bird. The ship was approaching Odessa. Gavrik! Here, here it's us! Hey! Turgenev! Didn't you see us? Your ticket! Don't mention it. Sorry. Sorry. Squadron on the horizon. Daddy! - Potemkin is in front. - Where? May I borrow your binoculars. Which one is Potemkin? There, in the middle. With the three funnels. The tugboat leading, is from Romania. Enough! - Why are they rebelling, darling? - It's very simple. Treasury money has been stolen. - One hundred and twenty thousand! - What were you doing there? Bastard! Have you eaten borscht with worms? - And have officers hit you in the face? - Zhukov! What Zhukov? Well, what do you say, Rodion Zhukov? Here we are! - From Potemkin. - Don't touch me! - Stop! - Don't touch me. you swine! There he is! Hey! There he is! There he is! He's getting away! There! There! Stop! Man overboard! Hey, don't play the fool! Stop messing around. Get off! Mister! Are you drowning? Oh, to hell with it! Don't show me to anyone. I'm a sailor. Hide me somewhere, or I'll be hanged! Honest to God, it's true! Well I never! The following morning. Flounder, plaice, flounder! Flounder, plaice, flounder! Fried fish! Fried fish! Crayfish! Fried fish! Live fish! Who wants fresh fish? Flounder, plaice, flounder! Well! Show me. Bullheads. Well! Where are the bullheads? You know very well, auntie. It's in your hand. What do you see? Show me where? I don't see. Maybe it's this I'm holding? These aren't bullheads, they're lice! Is there anything to fry? There isn't even anything to fry. Eh! For good measure... Two hundred. OK! Well... 30 kopecks a hundred... 60 kopecks. You still owe me one rouble 40. So, even with that, it's 80. That's what you tell grandpa. Take the basket. Goodbye. Madame Storozhenko... Bullheads! Fried fish! Live fish! Live fish! Live fish! Gavrik! Hi, Gavrik! I saw you first. Hi, Petya! Oh, Gavrik! Guess what happened to us on the boat? You can't imagine. You know... Come here. And this one hits him with an umbrella in the face. Word of honour! And he shouted to the whole boat: "Stop! Stop!" You can spit in my eye, if I'm lying. Okay, okay. Just don't be so noisy. Then this one jumps up on the railing, and throws himself into the water. Ba-boom! And then there was the splash. High! Right up to the fourth floor. I'll be damned! What was he like? With an anchor on his hand or something? Right there! Yeah, right! But how did you know? Well... I haven't seen any sailors! I'll throw! - I'm closest! - No, me! - Me! - Me! - They're playing lugs. Let's go? - What's lugs? Come on, I'll teach you! I'm closer. Again! Me. Again! Me. Again! Me. All mine. Well, put up more! Again! Me. Again! Me. - Again! Me. Put up some more! - I don't have any more. Well! Who else wants to? Come on! Let me try. Hit it! Oh, you! You don't know how to hit it. Again! Again! Gavrik! Don't be so mean. Give me a dozen to make a profit. Don't paw! You can't buy them. Lugs cost money. Okay, Gavrik. You wait for me here. I'll run home for the money. Go on! So, nothing like that happened yesterday? Nothing at all. And I heard that yesterday, on the opposite shore a man fell off the steamer. - Do you know anything? - That's the first I've heard of it. Strange, isn't it? Nobody knows anything. Boy, are you from round here? I'm local. - Fisherman? - Fisherman. Come here. Don't be afraid. So, fishing! What's your name? - Gavrik. - So, Gavryukha. Uh-huh. Gavryukha. That's it! Gavryukha. Want to shoot? Mister, are you making fun of me? Don't you trust me? Here! Shoot. Which one, young man? A pistol or a rifle? The "Monte Cristo". Well, what is it? Shoot! You know what? I'd rather not shoot. I've already aimed anyway. I'd rather you bought me a drink, seltzer with syrup. - It would also be cheaper. - I've nothing against it. Daddy! - Dad! - Well, Petya? - What is it darling? - Dad, give me five kopecks. And for what? I really need it. Well, tell me anyway! I need to know what you're going to spend it on... this amount? I'll buy myself a chocolate bar. Chocolate? Fine! It's hard to argue over that. Take your pick. Thank you, Daddy. A frog was going down a path Hopping on its funny little legs Kwa-Kwa, Kwa-Kwa-Kwa! Hopping on its legs There was a frog on the path Kwa-Kwa, Kwa-Kwa-Kwa! - Well, Gavryukha like it? - Thank you, mister. - I've never tasted anything so delicious. - Well, I guess so! Listen. I want to ask you something. - Yesterday you were fishing? - You bet. - And you saw the steamer Turgenev? - And how! It nearly wrecked our anchor rope. Did anyone jump off the steamer? No-o! Oh, yes, they did. What a jump, spray flying in all directions. He was swimming like this. Wait, wait, wait. You're lying! Honest to God. On the true holy cross. And where did he go then? Then? And then a boat picked him up. The local one? No-oo! From Dorf! All painted blue and half red. - Under sail. - Did you notice the name of the boat? You bet. Sonya. Sonya? Great! You're not lying? Holy true cross. Or may I drop down dead. Well, look! The turrets, fire! Where is the Odessa Committee? Let me go to the Committee. Don't shoot! Well, to hell with you! You'll shoot all the boots. Mister! Mister! Don't worry, it's me! Hey, wasn't it you who jumped from the steamer Turgenev yesterday? Someone was asking about you. With a moustache. Probably a detective. Where are you going? You're sick! - Let me go! Come on. - Don't you worry. I fooled him. I sent him, uh-oh... where was it, all the way to Lustdorf. Lie down, mister. Grandpa, what's up? Did she give you the money? Money? Phooey! Say thank you to that fool, the Miracle Worker. Pray for him... the old codger, let him burst! Catching large bullheads, he's on the spot. But getting a decent price at market... he's nowhere to be found! For the bullheads... 30 kopecks a hundred! Have you seen the like? On the holy true cross. Whoever you want, ask. The whole market saw me spit in that Storozhenka's damned eye! Don't touch him, grandpa. Let him rest. Sleeps... and doesn't smell a thing. Hey, sailor, sailor. you're in a tight spot. Listen, Grandpa, the sailor was on about a committee of some kind. I'll go to Terenti! In cases like this, he'll know better than us. Go, grandson, go. Gavrik, I was waiting for you. I'm going to grammar school tomorrow. Don't slack! - Will that be you? - Sure! - Looks great. - You bet! Look at all those lugs! Here! It's a lot of lugs! Let's play! No time. I have to go - Where to? - To Near Mills. - To my brother. - Why? Because I do. Let's go together? I have an exam tomorrow. Suit yourself. Hey, Petya! The moustache, did he have sandals and glasses? Yes, pince-nez. How do you know? Swear, never tell to anyone? Golly! On the holy true cross. - Or else! - May I drop down dead. May my eyes pop out! Petya! Eat the earth, never to tell anyone. Eat! - Come, Come! - Here, take the book. The strikers are being led away. Well! "Well" what? Well, tell me what you were going to say. You'll get nothing from me! I ate the ground. Okay, Gavrik, I'll remember. Tsifrochka doesn't recognise you! It's alright, Terenti. It's your brother. - And who is this? - Petya from Kanatnaya. A schoolmaster's kid. He's alright. And where are the shoes I got you for Easter? - You still walk around like a tramp. - Uh... where are the shoes? Oh, you vagabond. Well, let's go! - On strike? - Uh-huh. Well, well! What's up? Look who came! Gavrik came. Say to Uncle Gavrik: "Dear Uncle Gavrik." - Here! - Come on, Zhenochka! Take a pen! This is Petya from Kanatnaya, he goes to the Gymnasium. Go play if you want. Give Zhenochka to me. Don't be afraid, he won't bite. Want me to show you some Russian-Japanese pictures? Will you? See boy, Jappies. Not Jappies, it's Japs. Ah! Serves you right. - Don't poke your nose. - Don't pry! Hey, Petya! What's that sailor called? - What sailor? - That jumped from the Turgenev. Ah! Zhukov. Rodion Zhukov. Go away, we're playing. Motya, invite your gentleman friend to come and eat. He's probably hungry. - Do you want to eat kulesh with us? - Merci. Teriosha! - Where are you going? - Business. Evening. It's alright, mister. Our Terenti has come. Hello! Here's the sail, as promised. Oh, my God! I met Gavrik, so I thought I'd visit my folks. Uh, yes, I see you've got someone in residence. Hello. Our drowned man. So I heard. Rodion Zhukov. Suppose I am Zhukov. And who are you? Terenti. Go on! You can take me for the committee. You can trust me. Prove it? Ilya Borisovich. Come here for a minute. I remember this fellow. He stood guard over Vakulinchuk's body. You were there, comrade? Fact! You see! I wasn't mistaken. Waste no time and change. And it seems to me, this home is under surveillance. Gavrik! Go see! - Let me go! - Shut up! - Let me go... - Shut up, or I'll kill you! Run... run! Run! Shut up! Ilya Borisovich, shoot. If they get away, I'll tear your heads off! They climbed the cliff. Terenti led them to the catacombs. If they don't get shot, they're sure to get away. Don't stand there like idiots. Search the whole shore, take them alive! Stand up, in the presence of an officer, you scoundrel. Well... So you're hiding outlaws. Not at all. - Speak up now, who was just here? - I don't know, sir. Oh, so you don't know... Silence! Who was here? I don't know. Don't hit him, he's an old man! Take this scoundrel into custody. Grandpa! Grandpa! 15 October 1905 Home! Home! Home! Home!

Where were you, Grandpa? The Alexandrovsky Prospect has been crushed. Hey, Gavryukha. Go with Grandpa to Malaya Arnautskaya number 15, ask for Joseph Karlovich. Tell him: "Sofia Petrovna sent to ask if you've a letter from Nikolayev." - Do you hear? - Yes. He will answer: "I haven't had a letter in two months." Then you say to him: "Terenti sent for some nuts." - Get more of these nuts from him. - Nuts? Nuts. Then with these nuts go round the corner here to the dentist. We'll be waiting. Do you hear? Sure. Let Joseph have our old man, take him to his place. OK? Just don't forget the nuts. Take your buttons. Sew them on or your father will scold you. And pay it back later. It's alright. Run along! Grandpa. Grandpa, are you in pain? Really, they knocked the guts clean out of me. Where are you going, Grandpa? - The Near Mills. - You can't go there. Huh? Let's go to another place. - Who's there? - Does Joseph Karlovich live here? - What do you want? - Open up. Well, I'm Joseph Karlovich. What is it? Hello, Joseph Karlovich. Sophia Petrovna sent me to ask you if a letter came from Nikolayev. There hasn't been a letter for two months. As unpunctual a lady as ever lived. I humbly beg you, to enter, young man. You seem to have visited my establishment on occasion. What a pleasant coincidence. Please, come in. Grandpa! Take them to Terenti. Just be careful, the city is surrounded by troops. Well! - Where are you going? - Mister, let me through. I'm going to the pharmacy. Go on! Mr. Officer, let me go to the other side. I live in the grey house. My mum is probably worried. OK, run off to your mother. Shoo! Here's what I owe you. There's not enough, it's 17 kopecks short. Come on, Gavrik, don't be mean. Give me the lugs for the last time. I'll make it up to you and give it back. No, that's enough! - I'm not listening! - Here, word of honour. Tomorrow for sure. - One last time. - No, I won't wait any longer. Now you must do what I want. Until you've paid off your debt. Fetch your satchel. Why my satchel? Because... And put on your overcoat. And the cap with the emblem. Show me your satchel! Nothing, plenty of space. Put it on! - Have you won so many lugs? - It's not that. Now you will work for me. You carry my lugs. Come on, follow me. Just don't fall behind. Your Honour, may we go to the other side. Me and my pal live in that big grey house. His mother is probably worried. See how scared he is. He can't even say a word. Go ahead, just be careful! Coming. Let's hurry! Thanks. Just in time. We didn't have a damn thing left. Well! Has Joseph Karlovich send some more. Bring what there is! At last. - Who's this young man? - This is Petya from Kanatnaya. He's alright. - Put them in the knapsack. - Well, let's go! Hey, Petya! Don't go any further. There's that scoundrel who twisted my ear. Look! - Moustache? - The snake! He knows me inside out. He wouldn't miss me for anything. The gun's been taken away. Hey, Petya! You see, they're sitting there, waiting in vain. They'll all get shot. - Do you hear what I'm telling you? - Yes. Can you go alone? Not chicken out? - Do you hear? - Yes. Go on! Stop! Where are you going? Can't you see? Mister, please let me pass. We live not far from here, in the grey house. Dad is very worried: he probably thinks I've been killed. Run along! Hmm! Students! The workers' self-defence units resisted stubbornly. What are you shouting for? Brought it? - Come up here! - That way? - Well, brought them? - Yes. Come on! Well! That all? - No, in the satchel. - Come on! Good for you. Thank you. And still a gymnasium boy! - Uncle Zhukov! - What Zhukov? Yes, I know you, on the steamer running away from moustache. Comrades, cartridges. Uncle Zhukov! Where's Gavryukha? Alive? He is. - Any ammo left? - There's some in the satchel. Comrades! Come On! Surrounded, the swines! That's blown it! Well, a schoolboy! Come on, chop-chop! Don't fall behind! Come on, comrades, one at a time. Wounded men first! Come on! Take that for the Potemkin, dear guests. And here's to the Tsar's manifesto. Come on, if you believe in God! Well, caught at last, old chap! Petya didn't get home until evening. Young man! Where on earth have you been? Today is our Pavlik's birthday. There's shooting in town, and your dad is worried. Cherry pie, cherry pie So-very-very tall, So-very-very short, So-very-very small, So-very-very broad. Cherry pie, cutie-pie Pick a person whom you like. Cherry pie, cutie-pie Pick a person whom you like. Peter, where have you been hanging around all day? Why don't you speak? What's wrong with you, son. Ah-ah-ah, moping. Well, it's nothing, it'll soon be alright. You'll go to school, get poor grades. That'll make your heart feel better. Oh, Dad, you don't understand anything at all. Here we go! Kids, look, I'm opening the piggy bank. What does it mean? - Where's the money? - There's no money! Dad, there's no money! What does it mean? Daddy! Word of honour... Daddy, there's no money! Daddy, Petya's taken the money from my piggy bank. Wretched boy. Rascal! I know everything! You're gambling. Where are they? Lugs, bugs... what is it? - Lugs. - Lugs! Fine. Where are they? Where's that street filth? Where are those germs! Yes! Here they are! Onto the fire! In the stove! - I want no trace of them. - Daddy! - Get off! - Dad! Daddy! Daddy! - Let me through. - Dad, just not on the stove! Not on the stove! - Daddy! - Leave me alone, I say. Get out! Petya was sick all winter. When he recovered, he went to visit his friend. Tsifrochka, you didn't recognise me. Gavrik! Gavrik! Motya, I've recovered. And our grandpa has died. Here, Zhenya! Where's Gavrik? He's there, by the scow. - Do you want to go there? - Of course. Then help me. Leave me alone, Motka! Hi, Petya! Hi, tramp! Fooled the fool with our four fists Grandpa Oh, you! OK, writer. Listen, Petya! Want to come with us on the scow? - When? - Right now. Motka and you. - With sails! - Sailing? Sailing. - Do you want to? - Sure! Well, come on! We're off! Just after nine. We'll get there in time. - Let me see. - Hands off, it's not for sale! - Is it yours? - It's from the Committee. Listen! Our sailor is breaking out of prison today. - We're going to meet him. - No kidding? How will he get over the wall? - It's so high. - No! Terenti will blow it up. Today, just when our sailor's having his exercise, Terence on the other side will light a fuse and be waiting. Dymanite, boom! - What'll go boom? - Dymanite. Not dymanite, it's dynamite! Dynamite, if you want, as long as it blows the wall down, you listen to me. When we get there, you and Motya will go ashore. When you see the sailor wave your handkerchief. - Got it? - Sure. Sure. And I'll wait in the scow. There was an explosion in the prison at the appointed time. The boys were waiting at the agreed place. Wave your handkerchief. Wave it! Wave it! Wave it! Wave! Wave! Wave! - Where's the boat? - There! Uncle Zhukov! Hello, Gavryukha. Stop! I'll shoot! Stop! Stop! I'll shoot! A single sail, a blaze of white through haze on a pale blue sea!
