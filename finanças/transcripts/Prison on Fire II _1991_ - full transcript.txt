Get up! Put the tools back in the truck! One followed by the other! Hurry up! Over there! Hurry up! What's wrong? Move! Hurry up! People are waiting to be fed! Hey, watch it! Sorry. Get down! -Move! -Hurry up! Get down! Get out here. Get down. Get down. Get down! Hurry up! Get down! They must have noticed Kwun's disappearance. Someone escaped. Let's bet. Anyone interested in betting cigarettes? -Yes. -What are the odds? -What's the bet? -How? Let's bet on the days until he's caught. The reward system is one for one for one day. One for two for two days. Our bet is for seven days. What if it's longer than that? One for ten. It's a deal! Come on, make your bets. Get him! Stop! Get down! Trying to escape? Still trying? How dare you? Stop hitting me! Stop! -Two packs for three days. -Okay. -Two packs for two days. -Let's bet. They got him. Damn! He's caught! He's a Mainlander! From which section? Constructions. Don't worry, we can still bet -if they broke his arms or legs. -Yes! Forget it, they broke his leg! Damn! You've ruined the game! Watch your mouth, Bill! Chiu Chow, we can still bet if it's his left or right leg. -Two packs, left leg. -Two packs, right leg. -Two packs, right leg. -Three packs, left leg. Three packs, left leg! Hey, have a heart, pal! He's suffering! Why are you so happy? What did you say? He asked for it! Shut your mouth! -What are you staring at? -Don't start anything! -What are you doing? -You don't scare me! -What? -Get down! Don't pull a stunt! Get down! Go to hell! Move! What are you doing? Get back down! I told you to get down! Get down. Is he dead? If you dare to escape again, I'll break the other leg as well. You hear me? Get down! Get down! I've lost my freedom I cry for my sorrow I've made a mistake... Are you crazy? Yes, I'm mentally disabled. The cell is as cold as ice Coming through. I'm here. Hey, who told you to take him away? Stay here and enjoy the rain. Boys, let's take shelter. Let's have a smoke. Lighter, sir. You should've picked a sunny day, pal! Look at us now! Play dead, pal. Play dead and we can all go. Play dead. Sir, he passed out! -What should we do? -No signs of breathing! Dead? Take him to the hospital! It's your lucky day. You better look the part. Come on! Let's go! I twisted my ankle. Sir, it's not my fault! He faked it! Tell him to get over here. 41671, get over here! Sorry pal, you're on your own. Hurry up! Hurry up! I twisted my ankle! I heard about you. You got rid of my predecessor. Don't give me any cause to fix you for good. Hospital shifts are too comfortable. Send him to Construction tomorrow. You stay. The others can go. Everyone back to the cell, except him! Fall in! Two by two. Stand in line. -Hi! -Hi. Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Hi! Say hi to yourself, Hongkie! We're not your friends! Sorry, my bad. There's no return on a good deed. I was just trying to help, but Killer Zau gave me a hard time instead. My mom would scold me for good. -Cut the crap! -Skull! Thanks for helping my comrade. Don't mention it. We're in the same boat. What's your name? Chung Tin Ching. Just call me Ching. -Lung, want a joint? -No, thanks. What is this? Taking a break? If it's destiny, don't be sad... Shut up, Ching. Your Mandarin stinks. You sound like a howling ghost. I wasn't educated in the Mainland. Your Mandarin is just as lousy. -Yes. If it's destiny -Hey! Don't be sad The flag of the Republic Is stained with our blood Stained With our blood Eat some. Fireball, have mine. Sure! It's not fair. We're all prisoners but we're stuck with the shit work. The Hongkies get the easy jobs. Are they more superior than us? We're elite from the Mainland. Now, we live like dogs. Lung, why don't you start a gang so we can live an easier life here? It's not that bad. We have three meals a day, no worse than in the Mainland. Fireball, you can't put it that way. The Hongkies bullied us. The cops treated us like dirt because we have no power here. There's no one to protect us. Why didn't you speak up? Haven't you heard? Lung, is that true? -Eat your food. -Okay. Lung, you used to be a captain. The comrades will follow you. It will be better if you lead us. Damn! Hongkies are not in charge here! Go to hell! Watch out for my plate! Sit down, you hear me? Sit down! -Get in! -They're coming this way! -They're going after innocent folks too. -It's a civil war. Go to hell! Mainlanders are getting hit! -Damn it! -Calm down! -The Hongkie is beating up the Mainlander. -Go to hell! Snake! Don't move! Squat down! Stay out of this. Stop! Get down! Get down! Get down! Get down! Fighting? He's here. Be patient, wait for the arrangement. -Are you starting a riot? -Shut up! Get down. Get down! Do as you're told. What? Hurry up! Take the instigators to the Security Room. I don't care if you're a Hongkie or a Mainlander. I'm in charge here! We came from the same ancestors, but can't even have a peaceful meal. Hey! What's taking you so long? You'll wash your skin off! Lung. I've checked your record. Lung, you have two more years. Don't start any trouble. What trouble, sir? Triads are not allowed here, so don't get any ideas. What about Snake, Bill, and Chiu Chow? Aren't they triad leaders? I don't know! What are you trying to do? If you start any trouble on my turf, I'll fix you for good! Killer! I'd like to see you try! What's so funny? Aren't you tired? Get up and talk! You know your mother has passed. Yes. I want to apply for leave to attend her funeral. I think you should. I'm new here and I need information. There's an incident in the cell. What have you heard? I don't know, sir. You don't? You're an old-timer and you hung out with the leaders often. You chose not to tell, right? I really don't know, sir. Get out! I only have my mother. Please let me go. -Get out! -Hey, get out! Reapply when you're ready to talk. Get out! Take him back to his cell! Son of a bitch! He's in there. Miss Wong. Mr. Chung. Take a seat. Leung, say hi to your dad. It's getting cold, put on more clothes. Don't catch a cold, okay? Don't worry, we'll take care of him. How's my mom's funeral? She has been cremated at Cape Collinson Cemetery. Everything is settled. Thank you. Don't mention it. It's my duty as a social worker. Your application to the orphanage is approved. Here is the agreement. Sign here and Leung can move in anytime. I've cleared it with the Security. I don't want the orphanage! Dad. Leung, give Dad a kiss. Come here, Leung. Let's see if you stink today. Let Mom smell your smelly feet. Give Mom a kiss. Is Mom pretty? I hate you! Leung. -Hey, stop running around. Sit down. -Leung. Sorry, sir. Leung, I'll be out and care for you. Miss Wong, please look after him. I will. -Thanks. -You're welcome. Don't be too upset. I'm fine, thanks. One as a spare, one for when I'm in the toilet. Watch the fire, mama's boy! He's praying for his mother! What if he burnt the cell? Skull! Go to sleep! Go to hell! Asshole! Bill, don't mind him. Mom. Ching, how can you put Leung in the orphanage? I'll take care of him when I get out. You can't. I will. Where's Ah Yee? She's embarrassed to meet you. Tell her I was wrong. Tell her I miss her. She cries every time we talked about this. Mom! Ching, come here. Why don't you settle this at home? Come on, come here. Let's go. You bitch! You made my wife a hooker! I'm going to kill you, you bitch! Ching, stop! Let go, Ching! Mom! Let go! Ching, don't! Get lost! I'll kill you... Mom... HAPPY NEW YEAR BEST OF LUCK Night lights Of a glamorous city I bury myself In illusions every day Forget my ambitions Ching, who's that for? My wife. She loves music. Was she a heavy smoker? Three at a time? She never smoked. What? A ghost in broad daylight? I'm in the cell -Excellent, Boss! -I moan in deep sorrow Sing! Behold the night Please take good care of yourself Excellent! They're messing with us. My tears cannot wash away my sorrow Watch out. They will start any minute. How bitter is the result -Louder! -I have missed my chance I moan in deep sorrow In the cell Who will pity me My heart bleeds I long for your pretty face -Why are you singing so loud? -In my dreams -I wish I could see you again -Lower your voice! No more sorrow Good! Encore! Now, a word from the superintendent. -Nice one! -Good show! Happy New Year! I wish you a timely release! Same old bullshit. Don't you want to leave? Yes! Then show me a round of applause! Idiot. Clapping for so long. What an ass kisser. You have any complaints? Any requests on New Year's Day? I'll take them as usual. It is important to be happy today. Why don't you sing for us, sir? It will make us happy. Yes! Sing! Quiet! Singing is not my forte. Perhaps Officer Zau can sing for us. Him? Quiet! We'll be upset if you don't sing. Sing! Sing! All right, if you insist, I'll sing for you. Yes! Let's sing together! Yes! How many friends can we have in life Can friendship ever last -We shake and say our goodbyes -Have a smoke, sir. We'll always be friends We part today And we'll meet again Even if we don't see each other... Skull did it. -We'll be friends nevertheless -Son of a bitch! Though we are miles apart... Stop! What should we do? Stay calm, did our boys get hit? I don't think so. Let's watch, then. -How are our boys? -Fine. They hit me! How dare you! Get him! -Go to hell! -Stop! Even Chiu Chow took action! Really? Move it or we'll be a laughing stock! Charge! Go! Separate them! -Stop it! -Sir, you should leave. Evacuate the guests. Lead the way. Ching, over here! Fuk, take cover! Go! Stay out of it! Civil war has started. Your boss is out there but you're hiding. Mind your own business! I'll decorate you for the New Year! Asshole! Happy New Year. Best wishes. Stop! Stop it! Take them down! Stop! Stop fighting! Stop! Stop hitting. I told you, I'll fix you for good. HAPPY NEW YEAR BEST OF LUCK Mr. Chung, Leung had a fever last night. He was sent to the emergency room. Don't worry, his fever has subsided. He's in the hospital for further observation. -Here. -Come. -Pass me the ball. -Here. Sir, my son is sick. I want to apply for a leave to visit him. Your track record is so bad. How can I approve it? Just this once, please. I'll be like a dog from now on. Really? My shoes are dirty... Understood. -Come. -Here. -Give it to me. -Here. Don't slack off. Pass the ball. Pass it. It's clean now, sir! Not bad. Now get lost. What about my leave? He never promised you anything. What a bootlicker! Get back to work and stop bothering us! I want to see the superintendent. This is my leave application form! Stop using the Superintendent against me! Even if he sees you and approves your application, you still need my consent! From now on, all his mail and visits need to go through me! Get lost! Let's go. Two days ago, Leung ran away. We've reported it to the police as a missing person. Don't worry, Mr. Chung. How can I not worry? It took you two days to tell me my son is missing. I'm sorry. That's not good enough! I trusted you with my son! You told me the orphanage will take good care of him. Then you tell me he was in the hospital and now he's missing! Maybe you'll tell me he's dead next time! 41671! I want to see the cop who handles this case. I want to know how he's going to find my son! Or do I have to go find him myself-- Lower your voice! Damn you! This is about as low as it gets! You have me by the neck here! How can I possibly not raise my voice? It can't be louder than you ordering me around! Your visit has ended! Take him away! Sir, he's just emotional. Please forgive him. Get out! Move! Even if my son ignores me, I'm still his father. Move! Open up! Sir, I will visit him again tomorrow. Sure, as you wish. Stand right there! What? You want to hit me? Go on! Go on! Scared? Useless shit! Lower your fist! Now! I'm standing right here and you don't dare to take a shot. I want you to stand right here. If you dare to get down, I'll take away your mail and visiting rights. If you play dead and got to the hospital, I'll inject you with drugs that will give you brain damage. Is that clear? Keep an eye on him. Stand by the wall! Stand properly! Trying to be a hero? Instead of a hero, you look more like a dog. Ching, eat up, return to the cell and get some rest. -Tony Chow. -Here! Nothing from my wife? No mail for you? Sorry, I forgot you're the last of your breed. So what? You can't read anyway. Let me see that. At least I can smell it. At least someone still cares. You'll just use it to wipe your ass. Smell it in the toilet. Mr. Chung, I have good news. The police found Leung. He's back in the orphanage now. What are you reading? You look horny! No worse than you! This loving family bullshit is too much. Yung, let me see that! Boss, this is personal. Who wants to read it? I just want to smell it. Come on! "Do you love me?" This is sick, man! Give me a break, Boss. Leung hasn't been eating much. I wanted him to visit you, but he refused. I know you are estranged from each other. I want to help, but there's nothing much I can do. You need to bridge that gap yourself. We are having a Parents' Day next month. It's a reception for their guardians. I know it's hard for you to apply for leaves, but please give it a try. -Sir! -What's wrong? A prisoner has escaped. Which section? Kitchen, 41671. Ready? Okay. One more. Do you like it? Stand up. Let me fix your shirt. It's tidier now. I'll buy you a new one tomorrow. -Mr. Chung, you made it. -Yes. Are they Leung's guardians? Yes. Mr. Chung, why are there no officers with you? I escaped. Escaped? I'll surrender afterward. Will you get in trouble? No, just an additional sentence. I'll get Leung for you. Thank you. Leung, look who's here? Let's go. Come on. Okay, ready. Move over a bit. Smile. Say cheese. Smile a bit. Don't stand so far away. Come closer. Math, 20, English dictation, 20, Science, zero, 37th out of a class of 40. Have you been studying? You know I can't be at your side. Help me out and be good, okay? I don't like it here! I want to leave! Where else can you go? Out on the streets? You know I'm in jail! I'll take care of you after I get out in 14 months! It's hard for me to come and see you. Don't do this to me, okay? Here, have a drink. Thank you. -Say thank you. -Leung! Let's take a picture. No, I don't feel like it. Just one, please? Take a good one. Mr. Chung, what do you do? Should I tell him? Up to you. -Don't tell anyone. -Of course. I'm with the Special Duty Unit. No wonder you're strong and tanned. Yes, tough training. What about you, Mr. Chan? I'm the superintendent at Stanley Prison. Are you all right? Yes, just a bit queasy. Ready? Smile, kids. Leung, smile. Come on, smile. Leung, look over there. You have a nice smile. Big smile, yes. Ready? Look that way. Can you stand closer? -Sure. -Thank you. It's an honor to take a picture with a VIP like you. The pleasure is all mine. You flatter me. Leung is a nice boy. Tau-tau, Yee, let's take a picture. Leung, look over there. Let's take a picture together. Mr. Chan, please excuse me. I'll be right back. Okay. Leung, look over there. Smile. Turn around, kid. Ready? Are you Leung? What's the matter? His father escaped prison. We're here for some information. What's wrong? Superintendent, I'm 41671. I'm here to surrender. What are you doing? Look, I have no bruises. Get down! Look, no wounds. You're my witness. Send him back! Pull up your pants! You're smart for asking the superintendent to be your witness. You think I would have mercy on you? Bastard! Do you need your injuries examined? No. Don't be smug. I'll fix you for good. Sorry, sir. Please give me another chance. You're cocky. Give him the usual! You think this is funny? Look pitiful or I'll really break your legs. -Hey, come and see for yourself! -What the hell? Raise your arm. Get going. CONSEQUENCES OF ESCAPING What happened? Hey, don't stand so close. Just a chat, sir. How are you feeling? Will you ever walk again? You knew Killer would break your leg. Why did you escape? Boss Leung wanted to see me. Damn! Who's he? Does he run Mongkok, Wanchai or TST East? No, he's all over Hong Kong now. Bullshit! I've never heard of him! You've been here too long, that's why. I've heard of him. He is famous now. Really? What does he want with a small potato like you? I can't tell you, it's strictly confidential. Did you cross him? A little. What is it? Bill, you must help me. Let me find out what's going on. -Yung! -Yes, Boss? Go find out about Leung. Ching, take care! -Thanks. -Take care! -They're wasting money fixing you up. -I'm fine. -Take care. -Thanks. Well? Is this good enough? Ching is lonely In the cold cell Sorrow troubles me But there's no one who can help me -Why don't you answer me... -Lower down your voice, Ching. People are trying to sleep. My leg is painful Do you have some... Get some sleep after smoking. I took a lot of pictures with Leung today. Thanks. Looking for me, sir? About the job I asked about. What's taking you so long? I'm waiting for the right time. Do it in the toilet, I'll arrange the rest. Very well. No way, you've fully recovered? Yes, as good as new. How is that possible? Boss Leung cured me. Leung? He was here? No! He's much better than that. -Wait! -Yes, Boss? You are really fine. How did he fix you up? -Have you heard of superpowers? -Yes. He cured me remotely. I've heard of that. He swallowed old currencies and spit out new ones. He knows more than you do. Really? You'll become invincible then. He just needs to move a finger. Yes, that will work. Keung, I need to pee. I'll introduce him to you someday. I must meet him. Boss, don't believe him. He's nuts. You think I'm stupid? Go check it out! Why did you hit me? Let's go! What's the matter? You owe me cigarettes, asshole! -When? -Do you think we're pushovers? Bastard! Go to hell! What's going on? It's none of your damn business! Get back here! Go to hell! How dare you look down on us! Damn you! How dare you hit me? Go to hell! How dare you? Squid, Boss is in a fight in the toilet. What? Go to hell! Where are you going? We're going for a walk. -Yes. -Shut up! I need to go to the toilet! Stop it! Stop fighting! Stop! Snake! -Snake! -Don't move! -Snake! -Don't move! Snake! Everyone, get down! Get down! Move! Did you hear me? Don't do anything stupid! Get down! Drop your weapon! Why are you hiding? Get out here! Hurry up! Get down! What have you done? I don't know. I ambushed Ching in the toilet. Snake came to his rescue. You know, those Hongkies kept bullying us. We broke into a gang fight. Did Lung stab Snake? Sign this statement. You'll testify that he did it. I'll be dead if I do that. Lung? I'll put him in isolation. This affidavit is for internal use. No one will know you did it. You need to find a fall guy. I know. What's the matter? Sit down two by two, we're doing the count. What are you doing? Filming a fight scene? Mainlanders, pack up! We're moving you! Ching, get up! Ching! Get up! Keung, not so loud. Sign this. Where? Here! You're making too much noise. Sorry, Keung. Keep it down! Lung? What's the matter? Sorry if I woke you. I'm still awake. Then let's chat. Sure! Damn! Looking good. No problem at all. Lung, scrub harder! It's for the benefit of the next fellow. "Patience brings peace, endurance widens the horizon." I wrote that. What do you think? Naive! Naive? It's profound. What's your advice? Let me give you some advice. Great! There! You got it? Thank you very much. Lung, don't slack off! I'm pushing like a dog back here! I'm not slacking off! I'm doing my best! Come on! Let's take a break! That's heavy. I'm dying. Thanks. This has become a habit for you. Just say thank you and shut up. Thanks, Keung. Here, take it. Ching, how did you escape last time? -See that wired fence? -Yes. Beyond that is a cliff. I jumped into the sea from the cliff. How high is it? Just ten feet or so. Look! I'm still alive! You risked your life to see your boss, Leung? Yes, he has great influence. You're smart like him, but he has more influence. Really? Is there really a man like him? Yes. I must meet him. I'll introduce you one day. Here you go. -Thanks. -Don't mention it. The injured prisoner died this morning. You're charged for murder. We'll send you to Lai Chi Kok Detention Center. -Zau, take him away. -Yes, sir. I didn't kill him. We have enough evidence to charge you. Take him away. Superintendent, I... Save your statement for the judge. You have something to say? I know who killed Snake. I'll tell only you. Both of you, step outside. Open up! Get me some coffee. Get out, all of you! Hurry up! Hurry up! Get down! What are you doing? Stop the truck! Stop! Stop! Stop running! Damn! This is more than ten feet! I would say it's more than a hundred feet! Ching, what have you done to me? Come on, don't jump! Don't jump! You won't make it! Don't come near, or I'll jump! Don't! Come back up! If he can do it, I can do it. Don't jump! What? He jumped? Yes. How high is it? A few hundred feet. Actually less than a hundred. Damn! You flattered me, Lung! How can you believe this bullshit? We've barely known each other. Please don't haunt me. What's with you? He's not dead. You scared me. Is he all right? He's hiding up in the hills, but we'll catch him. Keung. He didn't have to run. He didn't kill Snake. You don't know. Skull said he did. What? Skull testified against him? Why would I lie? Here, this is for Snake. Snake, we weren't that close. Please don't haunt me. I had to beg for these. Please don't waste it. I hope you won't mind the smell. I smell smoke. Are you trying to set fire to the cell? I've had nothing but cigarettes lately. Of course, my shit smells like cigarettes. You can go now. So soon? You don't want to leave? Get your food. Close the gate. Fireball, the snitch is here. Tim, are you done? Watch your back, pal. Fook. Didn't you recognize me? Why are you making faces? Let's keep our distance. Is there something wrong with your eyes? Hey! Shut up and sit down! Stop! You're making a mistake! Let go! Don't try anything! Stop! Damn you! Stop it! Get down! Get down! What are you doing? Ching, are you all right? I'm fine. Back to your seats! -Get back! -Hurry up! -Get back! -Hurry up! -Get back! -Hurry up! Sit down! -Quickly! -What you think you're doing? You're in deep shit. They want you dead. Why? Skull said you testified against Lung. Hurry up! Bastard! Blackie, one more tonight. Okay, get in. Bed Number 8. This is the Mainlander cell. Do as I tell you. I request for a transfer, sir! Shut up and get in! You son of a bitch! -What are you saying? -Get in now! -I want a transfer! I want to report you! -Get in! Help! I want to see the superintendent! Help! I want to see the superintendent! -Go ahead! -Damn you! Stop! I will file a complaint, but I'll wait until tomorrow. Back off! Get in! You want a beating before you go in? Fine! Get in! Go to hell! Don't move! Don't come near me! -Calm down! -Stand back! Shut up! This is none of your business! You think you can nail me, you asshole? -Ching, don't! -Get out of my way! Stop! Get back! Get back! -Stay right there! -Damn you! Stay right there! Stop! Come back! Stop! Open it! Hurry up! Come back! Cut him off! Come back! Don't! Don't come near me! Ching! Don't come near me! Ching, don't jump! You're here just in time! It's over a hundred feet here! Lung jumped from here? Don't push your luck! Shut up! I can do it if he can! Ching, come back! Don't! You'll get yourself killed! Shit! A taste of my own medicine. Ching! Three packs for two days. Lower down your voice! I'll take any bets. You're not betting, Bill? I can't decide if I want him to get caught. Then I'll make my own bets. Yung, come here! Bet 50 packs for me. -I thought you weren't betting. -I bet he'll get caught in a day. You don't have confidence in Ching? Where can he go in the wilderness? You're right! I was going to give him a few days. Of course, I'm smart. Make the bet under your name. I don't want him to know I think so little of him. -You're so smart, Boss! -Sure, go. Don't go! Stop! Stop! Search the area! Stop! Stop! Sir, the superintendent is on the phone. Sir? What's wrong with you? You lost two prisoners in two days! You're in trouble if you don't get them back! Search carefully! Move! Hurry up! Over there! -Search over there. -Anything? Two prisoners have escaped. Chung Tin Ching. Height, 1.88 meters. Pong Fei Lung. Height, 1.62 meters. Officers from Correctional Services are searching the area. At the moment, there are still no signs of them. Anyone with information, please call the number 3981281. Tai Hang Tung... Zau, listen. Either you take care of them outside or you let me go deal with them. I don't take orders from you. Whatever you say, but if Lung found out I testified against him, I'm dead and I'll take you down with me. After all, you told me to ambush Ching or we would not be in this mess. What are you saying? I'm just thinking for both of us. I know what to do. Keep your mouth shut! Stand right there! Stand right there! Don't move! It'll kill you! Lung, up here! Quick! Over there! Attack! Don't run! Stop running! Lung, hurry up! Stop! Lung, this way! Stop! Damn you! Ching! Hurry up! Stop! Stop! It's very high! What now, Lung? Jump! Fine! You first! I can't! I'm afraid of heights. The cliff was higher than this! I jumped because I thought you did. Me, too! You never jumped? No! That was all bullshit! You lied to me? What should we do now? To hell with it! Sir, did you catch him already? You've been asking me every day! -Did you catch him already? -No! Not yet, pay up! All right. Ching is so unpredictable. It was only a day last time. Now he's gone like the wind. I'm buried in debts because of him. Place your bet, Bill. Ten packs. -Boss. -I'll take it! Two packs, actually. We've got no more, Boss. Go get me more. You're going to need a lot more, kid! Lung, have some water. Thanks. -Does it hurt? -I'm fine. Sorry, Ching. My men forced you out. They've been fooled by Skull. That traitor. I'll make things right for you. This place is swarming with cops. We better leave as soon as possible. Ching, are you all right? Great! There's food! Don't! It may be poisonous! No thanks. Have one. It's not poisonous. When I was in the army, we had nothing to eat. We even ate tree bark. Come on. -Eat it. -Really? It won't kill you. Come on. Not bad. I told you so. There're more over there. Don't trip. I told you they're not edible. Look what you've done! I've been shitting so much, my ass hurts. It's good for flushing out the toxins. Now you can walk faster. The grass is making me itch. Now that you've escaped, Ching, why don't you come to the Mainland with me? I've thought about it, but my son is waiting for me. Think over it. Even if my men let you go, you still have to deal with Zau. You escaped twice. You think you can walk out of jail alive? I don't want to abandon Leung. He's my only hope! You think your shit doesn't stink? Likewise. Four, three, two, one, zero! Let's celebrate! It's a new record! New record! New record! Ching set a new record! -Awesome! -Great! Boss, why are you so happy? Because he's my buddy. I felt so honored. You lost a lot! That's right. I lost them all. -Why am I so happy? -I don't know. -Bill! -Yung! I'm quitting. Don't let me bet again. You have no choice. You've become the beggars' gang. What can you bet? Your fingers? Don't be so cocky. Just wait and see. I'm just beating the dog while it's down. Come to me if you need cigarettes. Shut up. -Boss. -No need. This is the last one. Is that so? Lung, I found a bottle of wine. Can we drink it? If it doesn't kill us, we'll just shit some more. Drink up. -Not bad. -Sure. I've been on the run my whole life. I was born during World War II. I followed my parents running from the south to the north. My parents died during the civil war. As a child, I went down south again. When I was in my 20s, I joined the army because of food. My wife and I wanted a new life, so we smuggled into Hong Kong. Ironically, over the years, the most stable period was in jail. Now, here I am, running again. What happened to your wife? She drowned in the sea when we were smuggling into Hong Kong. You know what the saddest thing is, Ching? Not having a place to live in when you're alive, and not having a place to be buried in when you're dead. My wife was good to me. Mine, too. When I was unemployed, she tried to earn a living as a hooker behind my back. I misunderstood and I never thanked her. The sky is the lid, the ground is the coffin. All emotions end up there. So be it. Go with a smile. Night lights of a glamorous city I bury myself in illusions every day The night breeze kisses me Under the stars -Forget my ambitions -Forget my ambitions -No place to call home -No place to call home -I've wasted my time -I've wasted my time -I've wasted my time -I've wasted my time The stars are wishing you well Lung! Here I come! No! Don't jump! Do I have a pretty ass? Don't jump! It's too dangerous! Don't! I'm scared! I'll whip your ass. Leung, wake up. Get up. -Dad! -Leung! I missed you, Dad! Mr. Chung, hurry up and say what you have to say. Leung, I'm leaving Hong Kong tonight. -Do you want to come with me? -Yes! Miss Wong, thank you for taking care of him. Mr. Chung, you said you would leave after you see him. I'm sorry, I lied. Don't make me call the police. It's my duty to watch over him. Miss, please let me go with my dad! Miss Wong, I promised him. I'll take him out of the orphanage. You can't do that! Give me my son. No! Ching, the cops are here! -Please give me my son. -I can't. -Give him back to me! -No! -I want him back! -You can't! Hurry up. Stop! Police! Run, Dad! Dad, hurry up! Run, Dad! Run! Come on, Dad! Stop! Freeze! Don't arrest my dad! Go away! Don't arrest my dad! Please, let him go! Go away! Don't arrest him! Go to hell! I'm still alive! The cops at the station can testify! You wouldn't dare to kill me! How are you going to write your report? You think I won't? Plenty of people are waiting for you! Don't you worry about that. Damn you! Get in! Add one more to your cell! Let's go! Hold on! Let's talk. Fireball, I saw Lung out there! Liar! Beat him up! You fucking traitor! -Beat him! -Fucking traitor! Help! Stop! Hit him! Stop! I saw Lung! Kill him! -Move! -Kill him! The sky is the lid, the ground is the coffin. Hold on! Hear him out! You really saw Lung? Move! Step aside! Stop! Let him talk! You really saw Lung? How is he? How is he now? Talk! All emotions end up... Go to hell! Skull! If you come at him again, don't blame me! Don't listen to him! He ratted Lung out! I have to kill him! I'm questioning him now! ...end up there. Does Lung have a message? Get lost! He wants us to break out of prison? He misses all of you and wants you to meet him out there. How? This is a prison! By air or by sea? You're lying! Fire! Start a fire! How? Be specific! He wants you to burn down the cell. The guards will open the gate. It will be chaotic. When you get out, climb over the wired fence and jump off the cliff. He'll come for you in a boat. When? Tonight. Tonight? Quiet! Why would he bring us the message? He has my son. Fireball, he wants you to start a fire as a signal. What do you think? We'll break out if there's a chance. I have only two more weeks here. You stay then! Don't listen to him. He's obviously lying. Even if I survived tonight, I'll be dead tomorrow. Why would I lie? Let's burn it down! Quick! Quick! Move it all here. Quick! Fire! Get up! Fire! Put it out. Hurry up! Open the door! Open up! You come with me, understand? Let's go! Move! -Fire! -Let us out! -Quick! -There's fire! -Is Zau back? -Not yet! Open up! Open up! Open up! Hurry up! Come on! -Run! -Quick, line up! -Fire! -Give me the water hose! -Fire! -Quick! Stay in line! There really is a fire. Get down! Get down! What are you doing? Let's take a seat. There are too many guards, we can't break out! Don't mind that! Move it! Move it! Help! -What is it? -He wants to kill me! What are you trying to do? Ching, are you all right? -Turn him over! -Damn you! Damn you! Go to hell. Go, help him out! Ching, hang in there! Stop! Stop fighting! Die! Go to hell! What are you doing? What have I done to you? You set me up, you son of a bitch! Asshole, I'm not to be trifled with! Go to hell, asshole! Go to hell! It wasn't my idea! No, please don't hit me! Ching, please! Don't! Let him be! Go to hell! You think I'm chicken shit? Zau, you're here just in time! We've been at it for a while! Wait, don't close the door! Zau, please open up! This is not funny! I can't handle this! Serve you right. How can you say that? Open up! Zau! Don't come near me, asshole! Zau, open up! He'll kill me! Please! He's coming for me! Stay away! -I'll stab you! -Come on! No! I was just kidding! It's him! He played us! He played us against each other! Why else would I frame you? Think about it, Ching! Sir, someone will get killed. I know what I'm doing. I really have nothing to do with it! He made me do it! Stand still! Put down the toothbrush! I already did. Kneel down! Sure! Like this? Useless piece of shit. You're trash. Yes, I'm a pig. I'm useless. Ching, please forgive me. You're not worthy to be Lung's follower. I'm not worthy. You're right! Die! You just never learn, you asshole! It's all a mistake! Help! I'm truly sorry, Ching! Please spare me! Come and get me. Your dog stopped barking! Damn! Can't you let me be for just 14 more months? Open up. I've been waiting for this. Let's see who will help you tonight. Sir, please don't. Sir, don't! What are you doing? -Ching! -Shut up! Step aside! You're working for the government, not him! I'm suppressing a riot. What's wrong with that? Get out! This is an order, out! You get out! Sir. Sir, I'm your top aide. You crazy bastard! Don't come near me! Don't make me! Don't make me! Sir, calm down! Sir Zau! Calm down, sir! Are you okay, sir? Ching. Your son has nice handwriting. Of course. "Dad, behave yourself. Don't make me worry about you. Remember this, patience brings peace, endurance widens the horizon." Naive! Where did he learn that from? Your son told you to behave? -Quit gabbing! -I just did. Stop fooling around, get some sleep. Don't be so cocky about your son. Boss Leung, you're a good boy. Hi, Keung! You pulled it off again, Ching! My mom is watching over me. You're lucky someone testified on your behalf, or you'll be in big trouble. There are decent officers around. Don't flatter me! Ching! That's an additional 12 months. Stop being upset. Why did Lung come back for you? What did he do? He sorted it out with his men. How would you still be alive then? How's he doing now? An additional sentence, just like you. He is a true friend indeed. Ching. Don't call each other brothers over some small favors. It will do you no good. Be wise. Get in! Keung, pass me a joint? Do you ever learn, you asshole? New brand? This is what friends are for. The new superintendent is here! Give it back! Later! He's coming! Keep them for me! Attention! I'm such a lucky guy. Everyone is so nice to me. Do I know you? What a coincidence, sir. I'm the new superintendent. Do you have any requests or complaints? Sir, if you visit the orphanage, please visit my son on my behalf. That sounds reasonable, I'll consider it. You look smart. You're smarter. I'm honored. This is my copy. I can make one for you if you like. -Hey, no more breakouts. -Yes, sir! Great. Good days ahead. Lung! Lung, are you transferring to another prison? Ching, I've sorted it out with my men! They won't bother you anymore! Thanks, Lung! Take care! You too! I'll see you out there! Goodbye! Ching, remember your son is your hope! Mine, too! Don't worry! I'll get him back! I'll kill you if you tell anyone I'm afraid of heights! Otherwise, I can't be a boss anymore! You rotten scoundrel! Ching, get back to work. Did you sew that on yourself? Mind your own business. Get down! Long time no see. Shit, not again.
