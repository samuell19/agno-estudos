Well, I'm not a girl like you are. Hey, nice ink! Thanks. When did you get that one? This one? My Dad and his buddy put it on me when I was fourteen. Fourteen? You were just a kid. Yeah I guess, but it felt normal. I mean everyone I knew had tattoos. Then I moved to another school and I was the only girl in ninth grade with a tattoo and they all used to make fun of me like I was this little freak. Kids suck. I mean god when I was fourteen must have moved about sixteen times. I never fit in. Kids would always tease me. Why does life still have to feel like ninth grade? Why does it? You know that's bad luck? Fast Eddie? I know. I know it now. God, I've done some crazy shit with that guy. But he can lick pussy like nobodys buisness! Very important you gotta love a man that can lick a good pussy. Well, I don't know if I love him. I mean it's so hard for me to trust him and he always leaves. I think I left Charlie before he could leave me. How do people do it? I mean, how do they just have a relationship? I don't know. I mean I think you gotta have some kind of dream. Something to look forward to, you know. If you want to have any kind of normal life. Look I tried to have a normal life with Fast Eddie. I don't think any normal guy would have me you know as soon as they find out about my past they'd leave me. That's not true. Your past is who you are. There's nothing wrong with that. [Coughing] [Spits] Attractive. [Coughing] [Spits] Hey, what's wrong with you? Nothing I don't know. I mean they tell me I got some kind of like liver shit or ulcer shit.

It's better than growing pot. Yeah, I don't know. I sold my pottery wheel when you and your mom moved out. What ever happened to you and mom anyway? Oh now, your mom and I made a promise to each other that we would'nt talk bad about each other in front of the kids. She said you left us. I didn't leave you, I left your Mother. You know that, don't you? Oh, you know the problem is you just take life way too seriously. Yes you do. Now, you got to stop it. Stop it. Alright. They wouldn't always be together. Nobody ever was. But this time it was different. Will had given her something. Something nobody could take away from her.
