* (growling) (camera shutter clicking) (camera shutter clicking) (lion snarling) (growling) - (camera shutter clicking) - (growling) (growling) (camera shutter clicking) (beeping) (sighing) Woman on radio: Megan, return to base. Incoming greet in one hour. Copy, traveling. (engine revving) (chuckling) Man: Can you believe this? That's a giraffe. That's a real giraffe right there. (camera shutter clicking) Wow. This one here. - You good with everything? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Yeah. Hello, Tim! - Yes. - Yes! Welcome to Ukubuyela Endle. And... yes, we do offer traditional handshaking classes. - (chuckling) - I'll have to work on that. Nozizwe, it's great to finally meet you in person. Everybody calls me Mom Nozi. Okay, Mom Nozi. Well, this is Darius Pacheco - the videographer and my right hand man. Hi, Mom. Ahh. Now, that's how you do it. Where are you from? Cape Town, but I've been in the US the past few years, working with Tim. - Welcome home. - Thank you. Now, let's get you inside out of this heat. I'm gonna finish up here. All right. Cool. I'll take you to your reception. Yeah. Oh? - Hi. - Both: Hi. Mr. and Mrs. Foster. Yes. I'm Megan Henry. I'll be your ranger tomorrow. - Mrs. Foster: Oh. - Mr. Foster: Thank you. Why don't we meet back here tomorrow morning? Is 6:30 too early? No, that'll be great. Okay, great. Have a wonderful rest. Thank you. Nice to meet you. Oh, wow. This is beautiful. Thank you. We're very proud of it. Ukubuyela Endle means "A return to the wild." Well, I can't thank you enough for letting us use your reserve for our little project. Little? I've seen the presentation on your theme park ride. It'll be like people are on actual safari. And they'll find out that it was sponsored by Ukubuyela Endle and want to come and experience the real thing. I believe they call that synergy. Yes, they do. I've organized a ranger for tomorrow, so you can get started straight away. You know what? I think I'm going to stick around here, just get the lay of the land, relax a little bit, take some photos. I'll see if your room's ready. All right. Thank you. (exhaling sharply) (chuckling) Oh! Oh, can I help you with something? I'm good, thank you. - Hi. - Hey. I'm just checking out these photos. They're incredible. How do lions stay so relaxed up in a tree like this? It's a good place for a nap and a great place for a lookout. How about this one, too? This cheetah is beautiful. Yeah, that's one of my favorites. I took it last week. - You took this? - Yeah. You're a talented photographer. Thank you. Is there any way that I can buy these? They're not really for sale, but I could leave a few copies of them at the front desk for you, if you want. That would be great. Thank you. Who should I say they're for? Yeah, Tim Erickson. Megan Henry. - Nice to meet you, Megan. - Yeah, you too. And you're sure I can't help you with anything? - I got it. Thanks. - Okay. Hey, Kamara. Hi. Wait. Did you take that apart and then fix it again? Yeah, just needed a little tweak. Wow. I have to give it to you, you are pretty resourceful. Yeah, if I could just figure out how to turn three weeks into six months, I would be golden. I don't know how you do it - working part-time and finishing your PhD; it must all be so hard. Yeah, sometimes. But I am in South Africa, living my dream, so... Oh, and when is your thesis defense due again? (sighing) It's due too soon. Okay. And then, what happens if you don't finish it on time? I'm going to feed myself to the lions. Wow! (both laughing) (sighing) Hey, do you want to get dressed up and go to the Boma for dinner? What's the occasion? I don't feel like doing my thesis. - Yeah. - Yeah. (both laughing) (drumming) * Amazing. (drumming) * (Megan laughing) Megan: He might be. I don't know. Oh, good evening ladies. Both: Hi. Perfect timing for an introduction. Tim, this is Dr. Henry. Nice to see you again. - You too. - Doctor? She's working on it. This is my friend, Kamara. She's one of the rangers here. Not yet. I'm working on it. I'm a trainee. And I'm Darius. I work with Tim. - Oh. - Darius: Hi. Hi. So, how long will you be staying? We'll be here for three weeks. So, we'll definitely be seeing each other again. Absolutely. Well, we will let you enjoy your dinner. Have a good night. You, as well. - (chuckling) - I'll leave you to it. Enjoy. Thank you. Wow. Two very handsome guys. And here we are, completely available. Oh, speak for yourself. I'm available for one thing and that is work. Wow. Well, after knowing you for three years, I think I have that figured out. Are you calling me boring? No, never. I will have you know I think about things other than work all the time... sometimes. Okay, fine, every once in a while. Maybe I do spend a little too much time studying dung beetles. Yeah. Oh, morning, Shandor. Tim: Morning. Oh, hey. Wow, that's, um... That's a lot of great equipment for a safari. Yeah, you can never have too much. I agree. Besides, if you're going out in the wild, you want to get as many good photos as you can. As long as we get some great video, we're good. Oh, are you filmmakers? - No, theme park designers. - Oh. We're here getting some ideas for our new attraction. Cool, like a roller coaster or...? No, but I've done those. This is-- it's a little more impressive. It's an immersive attraction, virtual reality, special effects, robotic animals. So, all of this equipment just to make a fake savanna and fake lions that jump out and go "roar". Do lions go "roar"? (chuckling) So, how long you been a photographer? Well, my grandpa got me my first camera when I was about four. I fancied myself pretty good at taking pictures of people's noses, and then, you know, every once in a while, I'd catch an ear. Well, by the looks of it, from those pictures inside, you've improved just a little bit. Thank you. It's just a hobby. Oh, so, you're a ranger now? Yeah, but, um, in real life, I'm actually a research scientist. Really? So, I guess you'd know if a lion goes "rah"! Mmm. I would. Oh, morning. You can get on in. I should get back to work, but be careful out there. It looks pretty safe to me. Oh, yeah, I mean it looks innocent enough. But you see that field over there? Yesterday, I was driving by and I spotted a pride of 18 lions sleeping, completely hidden in the grass. - Eighteen lions? - Yeah. Are they here at the lodge, too? Oh, yeah, they're free to roam wherever they want. No fences? No fences, no nothing. Have fun. (engine revving) Yeah, there's 18 lions over there... Or there was. - There's fences, right? - No, there's no fences. (animals grunting) (elephants trumpeting) Megan: The babies are trying to cool themselves off with mud. Get some pictures. Beautiful, aren't they? Absolutely beautiful. (trumpeting) (buzzing) - Mr. Foster: What's that noise? - What? (buzzing) (trumpeting) Kamara. Come in, Kamara. Over. Kamara: What's up? Hey, so, I just spotted a drone flying low over the park. Can you check it out? Kamara: 10-4. I'm on it. Thank you. I think we're pretty good here for now. Oh, it's absolutely fabulous. Megan: It never gets old. (buzzing) What's that? (buzzing) See, this is what I'm getting. Oh, yeah, check out that. - What's that? - Hey, what are you doing? - Oh, hey. - Hey. We're just checking to see what's lurking in the bushes before we venture out. This drone is fantastic. I'm sure it is, but you can't use it here. - Really? - Really. What's the problem? Well, for starters, it's illegal to use a drone in a legislated protected area. So, if the authorities catch you, they'll take your drone, and you'll be banned from using the reserve. You're kidding, right? No. Well, how am I supposed to get my job done? I need to use a drone. The old-fashioned way, like everybody else. You get a ranger, you drive around, see if you can spot something. That doesn't sound terribly efficient. Well, neither's your drone, seeing as you're gonna have to stop using it. You just-- you have something against technology, right? No, but I do have something against disturbing the animals in the natural world. Personally, I don't think a little drone is disturbing anything. It's a flying camera. Think of it as a bird. You can think of it however you want, but you're going to have to stop using it. I don't think you're right about that. Would you prefer I write you a ticket and give you a fine right now? You don't have the authority to do that. As a park ranger, I do have the authority, and I'm afraid you're going to have to deal with me. - You? - Yeah, me. Darius, can you please bring the drone in... now? - Tim? - Bring the drone in. Darius: All right. Thank you. Welcome. (buzzing) Okay, I'll see you later. Morning, Megan. I was looking for you. I need a little favor. Anything for you. I was hoping you'd say that. I've changed your guests for today. I put the Fosters with Bandile. Okay, no problem. - Thank you. - Yeah, I'll see you later. Okay. Tim: Let's go see some wildlife. Darius: Oh, yeah. Tim! Megan! You know what? I think there might have been a mistake. I'm just gonna go check with Mom Nozi really quick. Uh, no, I spoke to Nozizwe and she told us to take the vehicle that's in the driveway at 7 a.m. It's 7 a.m. and... I don't see any other vehicles. You don't have your drone with you, do you? No, but I can go get it, if you want me to. If you're all ready, we can head out. Oh, and today, we need to see some giraffes. Oh, okay, yeah. Giraffes. I'll just give them a call. How difficult can it be to spot a giraffe? All ready to go? - Both: Yeah. - To the giraffes. They're expecting us. (engine revving) Yeah, good luck with that, man. There's like zero signal out here. (sighing) Well, this is great. I guess my safari attraction's going to be a bunch of people looking out over an empty Savannah, listening to weird sounds. Shh. Shh. (rustling) Darius! Darius! Crazy! Oh, wow. Look at that. Look at this. (chuckling) Wow. How did you know it was there? I know what to listen and look for. You know, the crazy thing is, you can be right beside them and not even realize it. How? They're so big... and beautiful. Do you want to follow her? - Yeah. - Can we? Please? - Yeah, let's do that. - Okay. (engine revving) Hey, Darius, just give me a minute. - I'll catch up with you. - Okay, cool. - Um... - Yeah? I owe you a huge apology. I shouldn't have had my drone out yesterday, and I did not take being set straight very well. It's okay. I'm sorry, too. I, uh-- I get a little passionate when it comes to the wildlife. Well, I appreciate passion. You don't have to be sorry. It was all on me. Can we just... (sighing) ...put this behind us and start fresh? Sure. I would like that. Do you want to grab a cold drink or something? I have a ton of work I've got to get done. Everybody needs a break. Okay. Yeah, sure. I just need to go get changed. I can meet you on the veranda in 20 minutes. Okay. (grunting) Hey. - Hey. - Tim: Look at this. I know. They come almost every day. Here you go. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Got you an iced tea. - Oh. Thank you. Tim: Oh, man. You could be a professional. It's just part of my job. Which one? Research scientist? Ranger? Photographer? Research. I'm working on my thesis, so I need a ton of photos to do my defense. Master's? PhD? PhD in Ethology. Ethology... Yeah, it's the study of animal behavior. Like... Jane Goodall? Yeah, exactly. Yeah, she's one of the greatest in our field. So, where did you study? Braxton University in Pennsylvania. What made you come out here? The dream was always to come here to do research for my PhD. So, you're an underachiever. - (chuckling) - It's an expensive dream. Yeah, and it was one I couldn't really afford, to be honest. But then, I heard about this rangers program and it would allow me to work part-time to pay for my expenses. So, four years ago, I packed my bags, came out here, got my rangers license, and here I am. So, you've been here for four years? No, not altogether. The first two years, I was here working as a ranger to get the money together that I needed to do my PhD. And then, I went back to Braxton to do all my courses. So, when did you come back here? Five months ago to do my research. And then, now, I've just been working on my thesis defense, which needs to be accepted before I get my PhD. When do you have to have it completed by? Now-ish. - (chuckling) - Yeah. I'm going back in a month to get the presentation ready. Well, it seems like you got it all figured out. Yeah, we'll see. I still have a lot of research to do, and then, I have to come up with a creative way to present my thesis defense. That... that is the scary part. Wow, that's a lot of pressure. Yeah. Speaking of which, I really should get back to work. Is it okay if I walk with you? - Yeah, sure. - Okay. Tim: So, what exactly is the research you're doing here? The big cats; I study their population, their behavior, their response to habitat loss. For what purposes? Conservation. A lot of the big cats are on fast track to extinction, so... - That's unthinkable. - Yeah. You know I admire you sacrificing so much to come out here and stick with it. Thanks. I do it because I love it. Well, this is me. It's been really nice talking with you. Yeah. Yeah, you too. And literally, I did all the talking. I don't quite know how that happened. I guess I'm an inquisitive human. Yeah, well, you'd make a good scientist. Oh, I don't know about that. I don't have the patience. The good thing about theme park design is that I get to travel a lot. I finish one project, and I move on to the next challenge. Hm. Do you like being on the go all the time? Yeah. Yeah, I love it. I'm here. If inspiration is what you're looking for, you definitely came to the right place. I'll see you tomorrow. See you tomorrow. * Darius: Oh, Tim look at that. Tim: So beautiful. (roaring) Darius: Oh, look at them go! (chuckling) Tim: Wow. The wildebeest came in? - Megan: Mm-hmm. - (Tim chuckling) Um, Tim, I want to see if I can get a few shots of the warthogs and impalas. - Yeah? - Tim: Yeah. So, I'll catch up with you guys later. Sounds good. See you in a bit. Everyone's meeting here now. Mm-hmm. Hi. - How was lunch? - Oh, perfect, as always. - Thank you. - Excellent. I hope you're both coming to the Boma for braai tonight. - Wouldn't miss it. - See you at six. - Tim: Okay. - Sounds good. What's a braai? (chuckling) It's kind of like a barbecue. Well, count me in. Hey, would you be interested in doing a short walking safari? Now? Here? - Yeah. - What about the 18 Lions? Well, we have areas that are cleared by our trackers, and we take the ranger trainees out there all the time. Yet another job to add to your resume. Yeah, well, we all participate in training here. Mostly, I just hang out with Kamara. Come on. Okay. This is what I envisioned for the theme park. Imagine bringing this experience to kids and families? I just got to figure out how to make it happen. Oh, wow! Look at that. Oh, yeah, they're so cute when they run. So cute. Well, I think it all sounds very exciting. It's not as exciting as what you do. What? You create. Not everyone can do that. How did you get into it? For my tenth birthday, my parents took me to Disney and it blew my mind. I came home that day and I said, "I want to design something like that, so I can go whenever I want." So, you went to Penn State. Did you grow up in Pennsylvania? No, no. I grew up in upstate New York. Hm. - Where do you live? - New York City. - New York City. - Yeah, a long way from home. Must be exciting. (chuckling) It is. It is. I love it. I work for this great boutique agency called Colvin Designs. Mm-hmm. It's the best job ever. Recently, I'm working on this proposal for Chipperfield Theme Parks. They're one of the biggest players in our industry. Oh, that's amazing. Yeah, if I get this contract, it would be a huge step up in my career. Now-- now, I'm the one that's been talking the entire time. Sorry about that. It's okay, I don't mind. I've liked hearing more about you. Folks, are you ready for tonight's entertainment? - Oh, yeah. - Of course you are. - Oh, yeah. - Drums, please. (drumming) (traditional South African singing) * Who me? (drumming) * Oh, that was fun last night. It really was. Mom Nozi really knows how to throw a party. And you were actually having a good time. I've never seen you laugh so much. (laughing) Okay, me? What about you and Darius? Huh? What's going on there? - He's cute, isn't he? - Mm-hmm. And Tim, what a handsome guy. He'd be perfect for you. Yeah, I've had the "perfect-for-you" guy. It hasn't worked out so well for me. So, I am going to stick with my very faithful companion: work. Ah, work isn't the only thing in life, you know? No, but right now, getting my PhD kinda is. Okay. Too bad because Tim is so handsome. Hmm. I hadn't noticed. Oh, you're coming with me to the school tomorrow, right? Oh, yeah, of course. I wouldn't miss it. Um, why don't we invite Tim and Darius? I don't know. I mean, Tim's here to work on his presentation and... Well, it's just that I'd like to spend some time with Darius, and it would be awkward if I invited him on his own. Okay, fine. We will invite them. - (laughing) - Ugh. * (singing in African language) * (audience applauding, cheering) Thank you for inviting us. Yeah, of course. You know, Kamara actually went to school here. Her and Mom Nozi come and visit the students every month. Really? So, what do you think? - It's amazing. - Yeah. Megan said that you went to school here. Yeah, well, except, when I started, there was one small building. Mom Nozi made all of this possible. Yeah, she raised all the money using profits from the reserve. It's so great that she's done so well and she's paying it forward. Did you want to meet some of the students? - Yes, please. - Yeah, please, let's do it. - This way. - Okay. (drumming) * Oh. * Tim: All right. Megan: Get in there. (laughing) (drumming) * - Tim: I'm getting it? - I'm losing my beat. - Okay, okay, okay. - Tim: Shoulders, right? * Nozi: Welcome to Ukubuyela Endle. Thank you. I'm Amy Bradshaw. Miss Bradshaw, of course. We have one of the best suites ready for you in the Upper Lodge. - Oh, fantastic. - Tim: That was incredible. Yeah, I'm so glad you enjoyed it. Yeah. I think they're so sweet. Okay, Daddy, I'll let you know how it goes. Yeah, sure. Talk soon. - Love you. Bye. - Megan: I'm not even kidding. Tim! - Amy? - Hi. - Hey. - It's so good to see you. Wow. Uh, yeah, it-- wow. - Wow. - I'm so sorry. This is Megan Henry. She's our ranger here. Oh, ranger. Hi. Amy. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you too. Amy and I went to school together. We went to the same design college. Oh, very cool. Well, I hope you enjoy your stay. I'm sure I will, thanks. What are you doing here? Oh, it's a long story. We have so much to catch up on. But I am just about to order lunch. Do you want to join me? Yeah... sure. Do we have enough time before our next drive? Oh, yeah, yeah. There's time. For sure. Why don't you two go ahead? I'll catch up with you later. No, no. You should join us. Oh, no. I have so much I have to do. I should get back to work anyway. - You sure? - Yeah, absolutely. It was really nice to meet you, Amy. - You too. - Bye. Okay. See you in a bit. Megan: Yeah. Looking good. Thank you. So are you. What a coincidence... (conversation continuing indistinctly) I cannot believe it's been ten years since we saw each other. - Ten years... - Since we graduated. I mean, it's so great to see you again. You too. So, are you here on vacation? No. I am here for work. We're actually going to be working together, at least I hope. You're working for my company now? The thing is, Tim, my dad just bought your company, Colvin Designs. So, um... Wow. (chuckling nervously) Oh. And I am now running the theme park division. So, does that mean that you're my... - Boss. - ...boss? Yes. - You're my boss. - I am. So, I'm guessing-- Um, I'm guessing you're wondering why I am here. That's the burning question. I knew you'd be shocked when you found out, so I thought it would be best to come here and tell you in person, especially since we've known each other for so long, you know? Yeah, yeah. Did you know that I was working for Colvin Designs before the sale? No, not at all. Imagine my surprise. Well, I appreciate you coming all the way out here to let me know. Yes, of course. We have a lot of things to look at with the new company, and I guess I just wanted to check in with you to see if we could work together, you know? Well, I'm sure we can. Yes? - Yeah. - All right. You know, why don't we go on a drive, so I can show you the world I'm planning to bring into my new concept? - I would love that. - Great. - Hi. - Can I take your order? Amy: Oh, wow. Tim: Look at that. - It's a baby. - They're so cute. Hey, Tim, why don't we get a few shots of you out there? I mean, it'll be great for publicity. Can you imagine the headline? "Theme park designer walking with the elephants." I'm really sorry, Amy, but we're just a little too close to do that. But why? They're so calm. Everything looks so serene. I know it looks serene, it's just really not safe. Oh, come on, it'll be just for a minute. It doesn't really matter. See the thing is, we have to remember is that this is their world. We're simply visitors in it. As long as we respect their space, they'll let us be here. Yeah, besides, we don't know what's lurking out there. Elephants. And lions, hyenas, leopards. Amy: All right, let's move on then. Can we find a safer space? Yeah, sure. Tim: Okay. - How's this? - (camera shutter clicking) All right, that's lovely. Could you scootch over to the left a little? - Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. - Cool. Amy: Couldn't you find anything better for a backdrop, Darius? I mean, this is-- this is gorgeous, Amy, and you wanted safe. This is the best I could do at a minute's notice. Yeah, but we should be standing out in a field with zebras running and lions roaring. I could have stayed home and photoshopped these. Okay, I, uh... Well, why don't I talk to Nozizwe and see if she can suggest someplace better? I really need wildlife in the background, Tim. I would even settle for a cow at this point. They have cows here, right? Yeah, yeah, I think they have cows here. Hey, uh, you have a drone, right? - Yes, I do. - Yeah, let's put it to work. You can't fly a drone here. - Says who? - Megan. What a surprise. (sighing) All right, I'll have a chat with her. I'm sure we can sort something out. Well, look, why don't I talk to her and see if she can take us out on another safari and find someplace safe I can get out of the vehicle? - Sounds good. - Tim: Okay. (grunting) Megan: Okay. You can get out, but I need you to stay close to the vehicle. - Are you sure? They... - (hippos grunting) They don't sound too happy. Well, it's daytime, so they'll stay in or close to the river, and I'll keep an eye on them in the clearing. Come on. So, Tim, why don't you run a little closer to the bank, so Darius can get a few good shots of you? Oh, no. No, I'm sorry. We can't do that. But why not? You just said that they stay in the river, and if something happens, then Tim can just run back to the car. Well, how fast can they run? Well, they'll outrun you. I mean, they don't call them a river horse for nothing. Yeah, I'd say it's probably a pretty bad idea to go down there. - Yeah. - Yeah. Did you bring your drone with you? Darius: Yeah, but you know we can't use it. Yeah, I know, they're not permitted. But I mean, we're in the middle of nowhere. Who's going to notice? Um... I'll notice. But we're all friends here, right? Sure, yeah. It's just, um, as a park ranger, it's my job to ensure that all of the protocols are followed. Everyone breaks the rules, Megan. Let's loosen up. Let's have a bit of fun here. Amy, if you're going to be out here, I need you to understand one thing very clearly: poachers use drones to find our rhinos and elephants, so they will not be tolerated under any circumstances. Okay. Thanks. I knew I'd find you here. Oh. Hey. Um, I just... I wanted to say I'm sorry about yesterday. I appreciate you taking us out, and I know how busy you are. It's no problem. I just don't know how helpful it was. It was great. Is Amy settling in okay? Yeah, yeah, she's fine. Good. You know you're a lucky guy; not many people have a friend who would travel halfway around the world just to visit them. I guess so. So, you guys have been friends for a long time? Well, outside of going to college together, we dated for a few months. That was like ten years ago. I haven't seen her since or even really kept in touch. So - sorry, I don't mean to sound intrusive - but... why is she here? Her dad... just bought Colvin's. Oh. Wow. - Yeah. - Okay. What does that mean for you? Amy is now running the theme park design division, so... she's effectively my new boss. Wow. So, what's more stressful, being a ranger or doing research? Oh, research, hands-down. - Really? - Yeah. I mean, it's... nothing I can control. I mean, I still want to do some more research on the leopards. And then, there's this pride of white lions that I was following, but they've been so elusive lately. I've never seen a leopard and white lions. They're really rare. There's only about a dozen of them left in the wild. What I wouldn't give to a white lion... and a leopard. Well... one of our trackers just spotted a leopard and her cubs down by the river, and Kamara and I were planning on going to see if we could spot her. If you and Amy wanted to come, you're welcome. Amy's got video calls this morning, but I'd love to come. Okay. Meet you in the front in ten? Yeah, I just have to put my stuff in my room. Yeah, okay. (screeching) (chittering) - Hear those alarm calls? - Yeah, what is it? It's guinea fowl and baboon. They know that she's here. (screeching) Where do you think she is? I would say she's about a hundred yards away in that brush up there. That's where the trackers last spotted her. Tim: Wait a second. Oh! I see her! Megan: Really? Yeah, yeah. Just to the right. To the right of the bush. - Okay. - Darius, you getting this? Yes, man. I'm getting it. - (animals screeching) - Megan: Nice work. That's her. You know what? There's-- there's actually a road up ahead. If we head over there, we might be able to get a better view. - Yeah. - Yes. (air hissing) What was that? A... flat tire. - Hmm. - What do we do now? Well, we'll just have to call road service and, uh... if they can't come, then we'll grab a cab. You don't have those out here, do you? No. No, we don't even have service. All right, everybody out, let's go. Darius: Whoa, whoa, hold on. Wait, you're kidding, right? I mean, there's a leopard out there. - Yeah. - Megan: Yeah, and your job is to make sure she doesn't come over here. Tim: How do we... Here. What am I supposed to do with this? Defend myself? If she does come over this way, just, whatever you do, don't run. Megan, you're kidding, right? Uh-uh. Out. She's kidding, right? No, she's not kidding. (clearing throat) Let's go. Let's do this. (animals screeching) (animals chittering) We should not be out here. Just... There's a leopard over there. Stop holding onto me, man. - Okay, looks like we're done. - Yeah. (Tim sighing) You okay? You look a little pale. I'm good. I'm cool. - Megan: Mm-hmm. - Tim: Let's go. All right, you know, we're just, uh, not completely out of the woods yet. That's a bad joke. Thank you very much, yeah. Uh, we're gonna head back to the lodge. - Megan: Okay. - Yeah. Wow. Doesn't get much better than this. (phone ringing, vibrating) Hey, Ames. It's good to hear from you. Have you settled in? Amy: I'm doing okay, Daddy. - Just a few little issues. - Oh, what's up? I'm not getting to spend as much time with Tim as I'd hoped. Why? What's the problem? He seems more interested in spending time with a certain ranger over here. Well, don't let that get in your way. I mean, you've been friends for years; that should count for something. Yeah, I'm working on it. He's your best asset going forward. So, you better lock him down before one of our competitors comes in and snaps him up. Yeah, I know. Working on it. And getting that Chipperfield contract right now is a priority, and you know it's not going to happen without Tim. Yeah, I know. All right, we'll-- we'll talk again soon. I'll check-in. Bye. Do you want to get out? There's no leopards, is there? I mean, there might be, but it's one of our walking safari locations. Don't worry, you're safe with me. Come on. Okay. Wow. Pretty cool, huh? You know, I admire what you do; give your all for this. Do you find any time for a personal life? This is my personal life. But do you miss going out with friends, hanging out, having fun, being spontaneous? I'm sorry, is changing a tire beside a leopard not spontaneous enough for you? (elephant trumpeting) That's a good point. Thank you. Look at them. Wow, they're beautiful. - Megan: Yeah, they are. - (trumpeting) I haven't seen many two-legged eligible bachelors around. You never know, I might find one hiding up a tree. Seriously, though. I dated someone for three years in college. We... got engaged. And when we graduated, we planned on traveling the world, doing our research, starting a family. And then? Uh... then, he changed his mind. Yeah, we-- we spent some time apart to figure some things out. I came out here, and while I was gone, he met someone else. So, it ended. I spent a little too much time crying over it. And then, decided I should just get on with my life. That was it for love? Pretty much. I mean I've dated a bit. I just... I don't know, I don't see the point in pursuing something if it's just not gonna go anywhere. Well, what if you unexpectedly met someone and fell in love? The timing would have to be right. What about you? I haven't-- no, I have nobody special in my life, either. I dated someone on and off for a couple years, but work got in the way, we drifted apart, we split up about a year ago. So, not a relationship guy? No, actually, quite the opposite. I'd like to find love. It's just work seems to always get in the way. Yeah, I get that. Sometimes, work just has to come first. Yeah, or maybe we just work so much because we haven't found the right person yet. Yeah, maybe. (elephant trumpeting) (grunting) Amy: Oh, look at all these magnificent animals. Yeah. It's such a missed opportunity to use that drone, don't you think? I guess so. You know, I don't understand why Megan is being such a stickler for rules. I'm sure lots of people send their drones up and no one really cares. You just have to be careful. Look, Amy, I'm just here to do my job. Oh, yes, of course, of course. Yeah. Can I? Ah. Look. Oh! - These are amazing, Darius. - Yeah? - Hey, can you send them to me? - Of course. Yeah, I'll make sure they get into the hands of the CEO. As a matter of fact, I can just introduce you when we get back. - No way. - Yeah, of course. That would be great, Amy. Thank you. I mean, you're part of the family-- well, company. You know what I mean. - I get you. - Yeah. Honestly, I must say, that's really good to hear. I wasn't sure what was going to happen after the sale. Don't worry, I got your back. Thank you. Such a shame that we can't use the drone. Can you imagine how impressed head office would be if we did? Just picture elephants, giraffes, lions, cheetahs, leopards, all roaming across the savannah. But I guess it is what it is. All right, see you later. - (animals chittering) - (camera shutter clicking) (camera shutter clicking) (roaring) (camera shutter clicking) (beeping) Oh, great, not working again. What happened? Is that your only camera? I know it's a dinosaur, but it's served me well. Well, you can use my camera. It's brand-new. The latest in technology. I know how much you love that. Here, let me get a picture of you with the cheetah. - Okay. - Okay. (camera shutter clicking) What do you think? That's great. We should probably get back before it gets dark. I'm sure it gets pretty scary out here at night. Yeah, but it's really beautiful with the stars. - (thudding) - (gasping) (both gasping) (growling) How didn't you get scared? Part of the job. We should, um-- we should head back for dinner. Yeah. Wow. That was amazing. I would like to make a toast to Mom Nozi for being the reason that we are all here, and to the beautiful friendships that we've made this week. But most importantly, to my friend Kamara because, tonight, Mom Nozi has officially certified you as a park ranger. Congratulations. Congrats. (chuckling) Cheers. Kamara: Oh... Oh, wow. - Megan: You deserve it, Kamara. - Kamara: Wow. Thank you. I would also like to make a toast. I came here to get inspiration for my work. I got so much more than that. Thanks, Megan. Thanks for giving us a safari experience that we will never forget. Darius: Indeed. - Cheers, Megan. - Kamara: To Megan. - Darius: Hear, hear. - Cheers. Tim: Cheers. (guitar playing softly) (all laughing) No, it was crazy. Oh, it sounds like you guys had an awesome day. We did. Maybe next time you can come with us. Yeah, maybe I will. Who wants an a nightcap? Uh, not for me. You know what? I'll have one. Whatever you're having. Tim: Okay. Sure is a charmer, isn't he? Sorry? Oh, look at that smile. Come on, don't tell me you haven't noticed. He's having fun here, Megan, and with you. It's part of the job to make sure everyone has the best safari experience. Yeah. You know we dated, right? Yeah. Yeah, he mentioned. Sometimes still wonder what would have happened if we'd stuck it out. All right, here we are. All right, well, I am heading out. We have a big day tomorrow. All work, no distractions because he's all mine for the next few days. No cheetahs, I promise. We're just going to a hyena den, full of hyena pups. - Hyena pups? - Megan: Yeah. See you at seven for breakfast. I'll be there. Doesn't sound as fun as hyena pups, though. Goodnight, Megan. Goodnight, Amy. Good luck with your work. Yeah, thank you. Tim: Yeah, I can't believe that day that we had. - I know. - Honestly. - Cheers to that. - Cheers. Hyena pups. Megan: So cute. I looked at your design yesterday and I thought it would be helpful if you could maybe lay out a small prototype or something. You know what? I had one, but I pressed pause on it. I think I'm going to be changing it up quite a bit. How come? It's just I have to find a creative way to incorporate all the things I've seen and experienced here. All right, sure. Can I ask you a personal question? Yeah, sure. I've been thinking a lot about our college days, and remember when we broke up, we agreed to remain friends, and we were for a while. Do you think we'll ever get that back? It was ten years ago. I think we've changed a lot since then. We're still the same people, aren't we? I think most people change over time. We have new experiences, we mature, we meet different people. We make new friends that replace the old ones. I don't think meeting new friends means you need to replace the old ones. I see the way you are with Megan. And I used to be that friend that you laughed with and had fun with, and I guess I'm just-- just a little envious of that. Envious? I guess I just feel a little slighted. I'm sorry, that wasn't my intention. I guess when we bought Colvin Designs, I assumed that we could just rekindle our old friendship and work together to build my new division. You're now my new boss. It's impossible for things to stay the same. Yep. All right. (chattering) (chittering) How's everything going with Tim? Good. Good? That-- that's it? Yeah, I'm having fun. Wow! Megan Henry finally admitting to having fun. Now, that's progress! Wait, is that a spark of love that I sense in the air? Okay, don't take it too far. In two weeks, he's going to be home, and I'm going to be back to my statistics, chasing lions, and finishing my defense. Yeah, okay. And then, he'll be back in New York with Amy. Don't you just find it strange that she's here in the first place? Yeah, I do, but she's his new boss. (buzzing) Kamara: Where did that come from? Looks like the lodge. - Hey. - Hey. Kamara and I just spotted a drone flying near the hyena den. It looked like it was launched from here. Yes. Several other rangers saw it too and called it in. Well, any idea who's flying it? No, but one of the reports said it was a guest of yours. Looked like the same one they saw last week. - It had a yellow stripe. - No, that's impossible. I mean, the only person I know of that has a drone is Tim, and there's no way he would be flying it. Is it possible that it was another guest? Tim's drone is the only one I've registered here. (sighing) It doesn't make any sense. No, it doesn't, but you know how unbending the anti-poaching team is about the use of drones. They may ask for a temporary suspension of your license. Is there anything I can do to resolve this? I only have two more weeks. You'll have to ask Tim to turn in his drone immediately. Okay. Do you know where he is? I saw him a little while ago in the giraffe garden with Amy. Okay. Thank you. Hey, um, can I talk to you for a minute? Yeah, sure. Privately, if that's okay. - No problem. - Thanks. Do you know anything about a drone flying over the park about a mile or so from here? No, no. I've been working with Amy all day. Why? What's up? Is something wrong? Yeah, some complaints were registered. My name was mentioned. Look, Tim, I'm-- I'm gonna have to take your drone. What? I need to confiscate it. You're not suggesting I was the one that was flying it. No, I'm not accusing you of anything. Well, it sounds like you are. Tim, I need you to understand I have a lot on the line here. This is the second drone incident in two weeks. If this is linked to me in any way, I could lose my ranger's license. Do you know what that would mean? - Well, I can't-- - It would mean that I would have to shut down all of my research. Well, I can tell you that your name won't be linked to it because it wasn't my drone. Well, is there any way that somebody else could have gotten their hands on it? No, Darius is the one that has it and there's no way he would have flown it. Well, I'm gonna need you to check because you're the only guest that we know of that have one. I don't know what to say, I'll-- I'll make sure we hand the drone in later today. Thank you. We should get it back to you when you're leaving. Okay. (sighing) - Hey, man. - Hi. I just spoke to Megan. Yeah, she came to see me. She seemed pretty upset. Yeah. Where's the drone? It's in my room. You didn't lend it to anyone, did you? No, I wouldn't do that. We need to hand it in to Mom Nozi right away. Okay, I'll do that now. Okay. Thanks. Catch you in a bit. - Hey, Panco. - Hello. How are you? - Hey. - Hey. Any news on the drone yet? Nothing yet, but I'm working on it. Mom Nozi, I hope you know I would never allow one of my guests to fly a drone here. Oh, Megan, I know that. You'd be the first person to shut them down. Is this going to reflect poorly on you or the reserve? Don't worry about us. It'll all get sorted out. Thank you for everything you've done to help me. I'm shutting down for the night. Can I offer you a nice cold glass of white wine? (chuckling) I would love one. Yeah. - Oh... - Thank you. You're the best. - Thank you, Panco. - Panco: Thank you so much. Both: Cheers. Have a good sleep. I will. Megan, hey. Hi. Hey. Um, do you have a second? Sure. Today, was a strange day. Yes, it was. I hope that you know I had nothing to do with the drone. I would never do anything to ruin your reputation or jeopardize what you've worked so hard to accomplish here. I know. I just panicked when I thought there was a chance that I could lose my ranger's license and not be able to complete my research. Well, that's understandable. You know, when I first came here, I was so proud of myself. I would just hate to leave feeling ashamed. Why would you feel ashamed? You're smart, strong, hands-down you're the bravest person I've ever known. I'm not that brave, believe me. I'm serious! There's not one the same that you've been afraid of out there. Oh... lots of things scare me, believe me. Okay, like what? Like failure. Not finishing what I came here to do. Haven't you achieved everything you came here for? No, I still want to do more research on the white lions. That was my biggest goal. And if, for some reason, you can't find them, then what? Hmm... Then, I will still submit my thesis and hopefully get my PhD. Of course you're gonna get your PhD. You know what? What? I can't drink wine without a snack. I can't drink beer without a snack. Do you think we should order in? - Yes! - Maybe pizza? Yeah, I'd love pizza. Wait a second, is this one of those cab jokes again? Maybe. Oh. Ha-ha. Got me again. Well, now, I'm hungry. Follow me. I have an idea. Eeh... Okay, don't mind if I do. What do you think? Malva pudding is officially my new favorite dessert. Yes! Wow. Maybe I should add chef to my resume. I don't know if it's actually going to help me with my defense. Don't underestimate yourself. I've seen people be swayed by a delicious dessert. (chuckling) Speak for yourself. Hey, I'm going to head into the village tomorrow with Kamara. Do you want to come? Yeah, I'd love to take a break. Darius is coming, too. If you want to, you can invite Amy. I think she has a day at the spa tomorrow. Okay. (chuckling) - Hi. - Hi. And this is my mom and my sister Annika. Hi! - Nice to meet you. - Hello. So, my mom has a store in Johannesburg. She comes here once a week. All the profits from here go back to the village to supply clean water. Oh, that's great. I love that. - That's so nice. - Yes. Thanks. These are beautiful. What do you think? Like this? My color? You know what? I think you're more of an autumn. Let's see. Oh, yes. It's definitely your color. It's so you! * Thank you very much. Thank you. Bye. These are nice. Yeah, my mom's going to love these. She-- she makes clothes for all of her grandchildren. Oh. Do you have a big family? No, actually. It's, um-- it's just me and my mom. My parents split up when I was two, so she raised me on her own. - Really? - Yeah. Was that difficult? I mean, we didn't have a ton financially, but she made up for it with more love than any kid could ever ask for, even though she was working two jobs to make ends meet. You sound a lot like your mom. She was really young when she had me, so she had to give up a lot to raise me, but she always made sure I had the best, went to the best schools. Is that why you're so determined? Yeah. I-- I want her to be proud of who I've become. I'm sure she is. How could she not be? Where is she now? She actually has an apartment by mine at the university. After I got my undergrad, she went to college and got a degree in nursing. That's incredible. Yeah. Yeah, she even found new love. It's about time she had some real happiness in her life. That's why I would never want to do anything to disappoint her. Wait, hold on. Do I hear a tiny bit of you being a perfectionist creep back in? Is that what I hear here? No! Me? That is so yesterday. I-- I got you a little something. - Really? - Yeah. - I got you something. - Really? All right, well... - On three? - On three. One, two, three. - No. - What? The same one? Which hand would you like yours on? - Put it on this one here. - Okay. Thank you. There you go. Thank you. I love it. I love mine. Oh-whee! Oh, man, I got some really awesome footage today. I'm going to go ahead and start downloading this, yeah? Do you want some company? I'd love some company. Come on. Well, looks like we've been ditched. (chuckling) - Hey. - Megan: Hey. - Hope you guys had a good day. - Yeah, it was great. Yeah. - Oh, I love your bracelet. - Oh! Thank you. Yeah, um... Tim actually got it for me today. And Megan actually got me the same one. Yeah. What... are the chances? (Megan chuckling nervously) You know what? I should get this stuff back to my room. But we're still on for the drive tomorrow? - Yes, we are. - Okay. - Bye. - Amy: Bye. Phew. I'm glad you're back. It can get kind of boring around here. Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. Hey, so I would love to talk with you about something important. - Okay. - Yeah. So, why don't we grab dinner, maybe a glass of champagne? We might have something big to celebrate. Yeah, I'm a little tired. Can we just grab a coffee? Yeah, coffee. Yeah. Coffee it is. Right now? - Yeah, yeah, sure. - Okay. Did you get everything downloaded? What's wrong? Darius needs to tell you something. Okay. Megan, I feel really ashamed of myself and I'm so sorry. Sorry about what? I'm the one who flew the drone. Megan: What? I don't understand. I made a really stupid mistake. The thing is, I was chatting with Amy and she had said she'd really like some aerial shots. And seeing that she's now my boss, I figured I'd at least try to get her a few. Look, I really hope I didn't harm your reputation. I'll tell Mom Nozi right away. No, Darius, it's okay. I appreciate your honesty more than anything. I just don't really understand why Amy would have asked you to do that. Darius: She didn't exactly ask me. She just said she'd like some shots. And so, I took it upon myself to get them. In retrospect, it was a really stupid idea. Have you told Tim? No. Please, don't say anything to Tim or Amy. Megan: I won't. But I do think you should tell him yourself. I really think he'll understand. How would you feel about taking on more responsibility with the company? What do you mean? I need a business partner, and you're the best in the industry, and Daddy and I would just love to have you on the team. Well, thank you. But what would that entail? Um, overseeing all the new projects, a step up the ladder... a big raise. Does that mean I'll be on the road more or stationed at head office? Oh, no, you'd be working more directly with me. And of course, a vice president position down the road, if it all works out. What about my team at Colvin Designs? Oh, no, I already have my own people. - (elephant trumpeting) - Oh! (trumpeting) * I'm so sorry. I got a call saying they were here. Well, I could think of worse places to be. I think I might come out again tomorrow afternoon to see if I can spot them, if you want to come. Count me in. I forgot to tell you I have to do a quick trip to Johannesburg tomorrow to pick up some equipment. Okay. Oh, do you think you could pick up a thumb drive for me? Yeah, of course. But... why don't you come with me? We could leave early, get back just after lunch. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. That would be fun. Oh, my gosh. Oh, finally! Aren't they beautiful? Yeah, they're just right here. How did we miss them? (low growling) I think this might be the best day of my life. (sighing contentedly) * - Hi. - Hi. Tim Erickson, there was a delivery that was made for me. Yes, Mr. Erickson. Would you like us to bring the packages to your vehicle right now? Yeah, that'd be great. Please. - No problem. - Thank you. You hungry? I made reservations at Aduna here. I'm hungry. - Thank you so much. - Thank you. Oh, I keep forgetting to ask you about your design. Have you done more work on it? I'm getting a lot of... great ideas, which is why I came here. Good. I guess you must be getting down to the wire. One week left. It's going to be kind of a jolt to leave here and not see you every day. You never know, it might be a refreshing change of pace. No, no, I'm going to miss this place, and I'm going to miss you. I'm going to miss you, too. It's been really nice having you here. What if, when we leave here, I come visit you, and we can go out on a real date? Tim, I don't want to get my heart broken again. And once you leave, I just don't see how we could make something work. How will we know if we don't try? Long-distance relationships are hard, trust me. Can we just try to enjoy the time we have left? We got a flight to catch. Why don't we go back and try to find those white lions? Okay. * (roaring) I cannot tell you how happy I am you're getting to see them again. This is so special - Yeah. - (camera shutter clicking) I can't believe I get to experience this with you. Me, too. Oh, no. Don't go, don't go. (camera shutter clicking) Okay, I think it's about that time. What time? Time for a sundowner. A sundowner? Have you never had one? Nope. Okay, well, it's tradition here, and you have to have at least one to have a true South African safari. Okay. Let's go! (animals grunting in the distance) Tim: This is unbelievable. I don't want it to end. Yeah, it's pretty magical, isn't it? Do you think you're gonna be spending a lot of time in New York when you get back? More than I planned. Amy offered me a partnership. Wow! That's a generous offer. It's a great opportunity, but I'll be doing a lot less design work and more administration to help build out the company. Do you think that'll make you happy? I don't know. So, where does that leave you and Amy? Well, I guess I'll be working out of the head office a lot more. You think that's going to be easy to do? With your history? Yeah, I think so. The boundaries are clear. The past is the past. Do you think it'll be easy for her? I don't see why not. Why do you ask? Just a feeling. Tim: Yeah, that sundowner last night was really incredible. Um, hey, Tim. Yeah. Look man, I'm just gonna cut to the chase. There's something I need to tell you. Okay. It's about the drone. Uh... I'm the one who flew it. What? I'm really sorry, man. Uh... Why didn't you admit it? Well, I didn't want to lose my job. Why would you ever worry about that? Wait a second. Did Amy put you up for this? No. I'm not blaming Amy for anything. She didn't ask me. She just said she'd like some footage. And so, I foolishly went ahead and did it on my own. Tim, Darius has taken full responsibility for this. He told us the truth and he's told Mom Nozi the truth. No, no. Wait. But what about Amy? She's responsible for all of this. No, Kamara, I 100% take responsibility for this, okay? Tim: I'm gonna straighten this out with Amy, if that's okay. What if she fires me? You will always have a job with me, no matter where I am. Thanks. - Thanks for telling me. - Darius: Yeah. - (elephant trumpeting) - Hey. Oh. Best view I ever had. Hey, maybe we can do, like, a satellite office over here. What do you think? We could work here during the winter. We need to talk. I just, I spoke to Darius and he told me what happened. Oh, my gosh, did something happen? Come on, Amy. Don't play this game. You know what's going on. I'm sorry, I honestly don't. - The drone? - Yeah. Yeah? Oh, sorry. You don't think I had something to do with that, do you? You didn't tell Darius you needed some aerial shots? I told everybody. I told you, Megan, Darius, everyone. Guess he misinterpreted what I said. Did you ever consider what this could have done to Megan? She could have lost her license and missed out on the opportunity to finish her research. I wouldn't worry about her too much. She can take care of herself. Oh, come on, Amy. You know what? I'm done with this. I'm done with the way you treat people and pretend like you're innocent, when you know full well you've done something wrong. The only reason I came here was because of our friendship, because I wanted to offer you an opportunity to build your career. I don't need you to bolster my career. And honestly, I don't know if I could ever work with you again, not after this. (grunting) Morning. - Hey. - Hey. Well, I talked to Amy last night. Yeah? And it didn't go too well. I quit my job. Tim, are you sure that's what you want to do? Yeah, it's the right move. I mean, what about your design? You've worked so hard on it. I know. So, what are you going to do? I have to go back tomorrow. Amy left this morning, but I need to get back and talk to my old boss Jim at Colvin Designs and see if we can figure something out. I'm really sorry this happened. I know how important this job was to you. It was, but, you know, I'm glad it happened. Made me remember the type of person Amy was before I started working with her. Well, I'm sure something good will come from this. I mean you're smart, you're talented, you're creative. Thank you for believing in me. Of course, I believe in you. You're an amazing person. And you even taught me that I don't need to take everything so seriously all the time. That's not an easy task. Can I see you again before I go? Maybe do dinner tonight? Yeah. I would like that. These past two weeks, they've gone by so fast. Yeah, they have. This has been... one of the most phenomenal experiences of my life. For me, too. We don't have to say goodbye. This doesn't have to be the end. Tim, I... I just don't see how a future for us could work. I know all the odds are against us. I don't want this to be over. Me neither. But you have a life to get back to and you have to figure out what you're going to do, and I don't want to be the person that stands in the way of that. I don't want to be the person that gets in the way of you either. You've worked your entire life for what you have. Exactly. Our lives, they're just too different. But they're not. We can't both live our dreams if we're together. What if we can? If there was a way to make this work, I would want to. But I just don't see how it's possible. Will I see you tomorrow before I leave? I don't know if I can say goodbye to you. Then, don't. I'm sorry. (chattering) (both laughing) Oh... It's been so great having you here. Thank you for everything. - Travel safe. - Yes. - Darius. - Mom. Bye. (engine revving) (breathing shakily) * (sighing) (camera shutter clicking) Hey, Megan. Hey. Tim left this here for you this morning. He didn't want to leave you behind, you know. I didn't want to see him go. I hope you can find a way back to each other. Love doesn't come along very often. I know. Follow your heart; it'll take you where you need to be. And this... is confirmation that the complaint against you has been withdrawn. Your ranger's license is still in good standing. - That's a relief. - I'm so sorry. This shouldn't have happened in the first place. No, it's okay. I mean, there's a lesson to be learned in everything, right? This taught me not to jump to conclusions, and to trust people like you... who have my back. Always. * Tim (narrating): "Thanks for all the memories. "I left the footage from the leopard "and the white lion sightings. "I hope it'll help you dazzle your thesis defense. "And if you see the white lions again, "I'd love to see the pictures." (sighing) * (growling) (camera shutter clicking) (camera shutter clicking) (camera shutter clicking) (camera shutter clicking) (phone chiming) (sighing) Okay. - I love you so much. - Megan: I love you. I love you, too. Okay, my turn. We're all going to miss you. Thank you both so much for everything. I'll be back, I promise. You better. * (sighing) Okay. Thanks, Josh. * Okay, yeah. I'll be right there. Kamara? Oh, my gosh! What are you doing here? I'm visiting Darius for a couple of weeks and I wanted to come and surprise you. Well, this is an amazing surprise. Oh, do you have a couple of hours to spare? Yeah. Why? Well, Darius is working on a short film project and he asked me to come and see it. So, do you want to tag along? Yes, I would love to. I just have to grab my purse. Come on, I'll show you my office. Yeah, yeah. Megan: I can't believe you're here. Uh... Kamara, are you sure we're in the right place? Positive. Let me grab Darius. Okay. Tim: I'm happy you made it. Tim? I missed you, Megan. Yeah, I've, um-- I've missed you too. You know, there hasn't been a second in the day that you weren't on my mind. Can I show you something? Okay. Remember how you said you wanted something spectacular to impress your committee for your thesis presentation? Yeah. Well... Um... Yeah, I mean, it's a-- it's a little low-key, but... Wait, just one minute. (clearing throat) (gasping) It's beautiful. It's... It's like we're back there. The more I thought about what I wanted the attraction to be, the more I realized... it needed to feel real. It does. Thanks to you. You're the one that inspired all of this. It's perfect. I love it. Oh! What happened with your job? I talked to my old boss, Jim. This project had been in development long before Amy came around. I was the one that originally thought of this. So, Jim and I, we ran with it. And we started our own company and hired all the employees that were let go of by Amy. That's incredible. I'm really happy for you. And the best part is that Chipperfield - the company that I originally pitched my concept to - they bought it, and they gave us a contract to create more. All your hard work paid off. I want this company to become our dream. What do you mean? They want more immersive experiences from exotic locations in the wilderness. I can work anywhere. I can travel with you while you do your research. I can do my designs from wherever we are in the world. Are you sure that's something you would want? I have never been more sure about anything. The time I spent with you in South Africa was the happiest time of my life. Mine, too. I was maybe... just a little miserable after you left. I'll go anywhere and do anything for you, Megan. I love you with all my heart. Please say you'll take this chance with me and make this dream our reality. You know, no one's ever been willing to... make their dreams fit with mine. I'll do whatever it takes to make this work. I love you, too. * (audio of fireworks whistling, popping, crowd cheering) (Megan laughing) Tim: I told Darius I didn't want fireworks. Hey, you can never go wrong with fireworks. And this is why we must make every effort to save these incredible creatures. I'd like to dedicate my thesis defense today to my mom. (applauding) - Hey. - Hey. Hey. Congratulations... Dr. Henry. I'm proud of you. Thank you. (elephant trumpeting) *
