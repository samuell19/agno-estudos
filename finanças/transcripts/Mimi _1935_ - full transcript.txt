(light music) (orchestral music) (soft orchestral music) Isn't it four weeks you owe? Three weeks, Madame Durand, three weeks. Hmm, correct, for once. You're learning to count in your old age. One learns a lot in one's old age. Did you hear the noise last night? What noise? The young people on the top floor. I think that they were making love. You don't make a noise when you make love. (man in back sneezes) That's something old age has forgotten. They were drunk. Well, I'd better see they haven't drunk up their rent money. (Musette laughing) You will be immortal, like Mona Lisa. They will hang this picture in the Louvre. If I die on this wretched horse, I hope they'll hang you with it. Doesn't it mean anything to you, to be painted by the greatest artist of our time? It's about time the great artist sold a painting. Throw me that thing. You see, I need new dresses, hats, shoes, shawls. The day will come. - The day has come. - Huh? The rent day. Oh. (knocking at door) What's that? Speak of the devil, Durand. Who is that? [Mr. Durand] Your rent! He mustn't find me here. Just a minute, I'll put some clothes on. Quick, through the window, to Rodolphe. If Venus would relent. Relent. Dum dee dum dee dum. Yes, a rhyme for relent. - The rent. - The rent. Huh? Oh! (laughing) Welcome, sweet muse. Or should I say, sweet Musette? Come and help me down. (laughing) What's happened to your trousers? - Durand. - Oh. Why come through the window? Durand. I know she's here. Didn't I hear her laugh? Monsieur Durand, you don't mean to say that you doubt my word? Ah! (Monsieur Durand laughing) (Schaunard's body thuds) (Schaunard groaning) What jackass is waking me up in the middle of the night like this? I was just dreaming that I was conducting my great symphony, and... Oh, it's you, Monsieur Durand. Then I take back what I said about the jackass. After all, why should I insult an innocent animal? Animal? (Marcel laughing) What about your rent? Hmm? The rent is due at 12 o'clock sharp. You shall have it at 12 o'clock sharp. - Well now... - You see, I've started to live systematically. That is, from last Monday. All right. 12 o'clock. - On the stroke. If Venus would relent. (knocking at door) Durand! Come in. Ah, my dear Monsieur Durand, good morning. Good morning, I came for... How charming of you to climb five flights of stairs just to bring me my trousers. I have an appointment with my publisher this morning, I'm already a little late. (stammering) Two francs 50, please. Ah. Very reasonable, very reasonable indeed. Oh come in, come in, come in. And what about the rent? (both laughing) I thought you'd say that. (both chuckling) Now, between ourselves, my publisher wants to give me a bigger advance on the complete edition of my works. He's waiting for me now with the money. Now in order to see him, I've got to have my trousers. Eh... But you don't seem to want to let me have my trousers until I pay you. And in order to pay you, I've got to have the money, which I can only go and get if you give me back my trousers. No money, no trousers. Oh, Monsieur Durand, you disappoint me. I thought you were a man of intelligence. No money, no trousers. The rent, Monsieur Colline. Oh yes. 45 francs, Monsieur Colline. Oh, yes. Are you trying to make a fool of me? I would never presume, Monsieur Durand, to attempt to improve on the work of the Almighty. Huh? Hmm! You know the rules. Pay by 12 or you'll be kicked out. A vulgar phrase, my dear Durand, to come from such charming man. (Durand grumbles) (Marcel and Musette laughing) Look out, don't break your neck. (all but Durand laughing) Why do you annoy him like that? - Oh. - He will turn us out. Who cares? You don't, but I do! Come on, what are we going to do? - Pawn something. - Pawn what? [Schaunard] Can't we borrow something? From whom? I have an idea. How about doing some work? Oh, poor girl. Now if I had a pair of trousers I could go straight to Lamotte and get some copying to do. But unfortunately... Stop! Musette! (doorbell ringing) I'm looking for Monsieur Lamotte of the National Theatre. May I see him? - Well, I... - He's expecting me. Oh, will you come in, please? [Mimi] (laughing) A lot of peacocks. [Lamotte] That's a lie. (laughing) How dare you call a lady a liar? [Lamotte] How dare you call yourself a lady? (Mimi exclaiming) (thudding) I think Monsieur and Madame are having a private conversation. But my business is very urgent. (knocking at door) I apologise for this intrusion, Monsieur Lamotte. One moment, please. I'm not a lady so I can tell you the truth. I'm bored with you. - Sh! Bored with your strutting and your posing. Sh! Bored with everything! (cutlery clatters) There's someone outside! (cutlery clattering) My coffee's cold. Did you ever notice that one of your shoulders is lower than the other? (Lamotte clears throat) (Mimi laughs) Behold! The perfect gentleman. Yes, I am. My only mistake was to pick you up out of the gutter! That's a lie! (dishes clattering) I'm an artist the same as you. Singing in a cheap cafe! And kindly do not break things that don't belong to you. Everything in this house was bought by me and is still my property. (Mimi laughing) - Please. What are you doing, packing? Oh, no, I'm merely taking my belongings for a walk in the Bois. - You mean to say that... - That I'm going! I should say I am. I'm going somewhere where I can breathe. - But Mimi... - Oh, I've had enough! I've been listening to a performance from you for the last two weeks. Now, now this audience is walking out of the theatre. (people speaking faintly) [Mimi] Did you imagine that you could buy me with an old bed, two tables, and a commode? (thudding) (Rodolphe laughing) - Tables, commode. - Ha! You only bought the piano to have something to stand your pictures on. (Rodolphe giggling) (pen rasping) Stand your pictures on. I'm giving up a lot, and gaining a lot, too. Freedom, happiness. Not for all the money in Paris would I sit here another hour! While you tell me what a great actor you are. Please. Next time I see you, I shall pay for a seat. - Mimi! (Rodolphe giggling) Excuse me. (papers rustling) - Oh. - Excuse me. (Rodolphe chuckling) Oh. (laughing) (Mimi chuckling) (Rodolphe chuckling) Excuse me. Mm. (chuckling) My hat. Huh? My hat! Oh. (chuckling) Oh! Oh. Oh, do forgive me. (cloth rustling) (Mimi sighs) (door latch clicks) (Lamotte clears throat) Well, Monsieur Rodolphe, what can I do for you? I didn't realise that Monsieur was engaged. He isn't. Au revoir. Well, some other time, say, tomorrow. Why not today? I thought perhaps Monsieur was feeling upset. Upset? Oh (chuckling) no. She'll come back, of course, they always do. (crowd murmuring) (audience applauding) [Mimi] Ladies and gentlemen! I will now sing Love Over All. And I tell you it's all a fraud. In 50 years' time, they'll all be as dead as mutton. Liszt, Beethoven, Mozart, all of 'em. - Only Schaunard will live. - Yes! (Schaunard's party laughing) Monsieur! Monsieur, if you please. Just you wait until my great symphony's finished. Do you mean me? No, no, I mean the large one with the high hat, who is making a noise like a bull. (audience laughing) Me? Yes! Well what does the lovely singer desire from her obedient servant? That her obedient servant stops making such a hideous row. My dear lady, I apologise for my bibulous bellowing. Play on, Maestro, play on!

Have a glass of wine, won't you? Oh, but of course, thank you. (paper rustling) (Rodolphe chuckles) You only bought the piano to have something to stand your pictures on. (chuckling) Not bad. (china clattering) (all laughing) (Musette speaking faintly) (all giggling) [Colline] And you really don't know where you are gonna sleep tonight? Oh, I'll find somewhere. [Colline] Musette. Yes, you can stay with me. Oh, that'll be lovely. Until you find something better. Is there anything else you want? Yes, fame! (all laughing) - If it's not on the wine list, we haven't got it in. (laughing) - Put up your shutters if you must, and throw us into the street. - Yes. - Come on, let's go! But remember when you're an old man that you once had the honour of speaking to the Great Schaunard! (Schaunard claps waiter on back) (all laughing) - Come on, let's go. - Will you bring the box? [Colline] Not very far away. ♪ Oh, oh ♪ - Musette, can I leave this in your room? Oh of course, here's the key. It's the room on the left, up there. - I'll show you the way. - No, you stay here. (all chuckling) (Musette laughing) (people speaking faintly) (light music) Did you imagine that you could buy my freedom with an old bed, two tables and a commode? (light music) I didn't earn much, but at least I made an honest living until I met you. I didn't earn much, but at least I made an honest living until you came into my life. (light music) Why did you implore me and worry me to accept your presents if you feel like that about them now? (light music) (dramatic music) (Mimi clattering) Look here, what the... (tense music) (orchestral music) Mimi. You. How did you find your way here? I didn't even know you lived here. (chuckling) Well, then I don't understand. Why bother? Life's so much more fun when things just happen, like this. Isn't it? [Mimi] Oh. [Rodolphe] You'd better come in, while I get you another light. [Mimi] But who were you talking to? [Rodolphe] To you, Mimi. To me? Oh, now I don't understand. Why bother? (orchestral music) One. Two. That's all. Now. (papers rustling) (clattering) I've dropped the key. (orchestral music) And I have no matches. But I must have the key. I'll help you. Now how can I find the key if you hold my hand? How can I know that you're real, unless I do hold your hand? What about the key? Just wait a little. When the moon comes out of the clouds, it'll shine straight into the room. (orchestral music) I don't think I better wait, Monsieur... Monsieur... - Rodolphe. Oh, oh, you're the one who writes so beautifully. - Oh you've heard of me? - But of course. Musette told me all about your beautiful handwriting. Oh. One day, I'm going to be a great dramatist! One day I'm going to write a play that... When are you going to start? The day that I get my first kiss from you. Mimi. (orchestral music) Well, I suppose it would be a shame to rob the world of such a masterpiece. (soft music) ♪ La da dee da ♪ (doorknob rattling) [Musette] Mimi! (knocking at door) Mimi! (knocking at door) (orchestral music) [Rodolphe] Good morning, Monsieur Lamotte. Sh! Not so loud! - And there's your part. - Thanks. - Thank you Monsieur Lamotte. - Sh! She's still asleep. Who? I don't know if you remember the little girl who was so naughty yesterday? Well, she came back, as I said she would. Came back? When? Last night; she begged me with tears in her eyes to forgive her. And did you? What could I do? Beat her? Perhaps; fling her out into the street? Possibly, but Lamotte has a kind heart. Very kind! So there she is. Monsieur Lamotte, do you believe in miracles? Miracles, why? Because a miracle happened in Paris last night. The same woman was in two different places at the same time. Think that one out, Monsieur Lamotte. (lively music) (soft music) Oh, I thought this was the room of Monsieur Rodolphe, the playwright. Is Monsieur Rodolphe a playwright? Oh, undoubtedly! I'm afraid Monsieur Rodolphe is not in. Could I give a message to Madame? Yes. Tell Madame that Monsieur Rodolphe adores her and if she doesn't kiss him this very instant, then he'll... (Mimi gasps) (Rodolphe chuckles) Look what I've brought you. I brought you an Indian shawl, a pair of shoes, lace handkerchiefs, silk ribbons, and these flowers. (orchestral music) How sweet. Oh, but they'll fade soon, and you'll throw them away. Perhaps you'll throw me away with them. Mimi, you and I belong to each other. Not for today but forever. Ever's such a long time. Sometimes, sometimes ever lasts a whole summer. (soft music) I'll make you a promise. I'll stay with you as long as these flowers live. (soft music) Oh, I must water them now. (orchestral music) I've never seen Paris from so high up before. And I've never seen it looking more lovely. (soft music) I was always told it was a long way up to Heaven. It was worth the climb. (orchestral music) Are we interrupting? Oh, no, no. (chuckling) (all chortling) The high council has decided to spend the day on the river and Bacchus himself has provided the refreshment. Right, we'll take a day off. We will borrow a boat and I'll show you the loveliest little island that... I thought you were going to start your play today. Oh, today or next year, who cares? Your friend Colline will explain to you that tine and space are just the ridiculous fabrications of our own limited understanding. Now change your clothes and we'll go, come on. All right, you go, I won't. - Oh, Mimi! - Well let her stay here then. Once you begin to let women make you work... Oh, Mimi, just this on day. Tomorrow I'll write you a play that will... Tomorrow, it's always tomorrow. How can you forget your promises? How can I believe that you really love me if you break your word the very first day? Well what on earth has love got to do with work? In this miserable world, we must choose between one or the other. Mimi's right, with us it's always tomorrow. I'm going to work now! We shall all be famous before long. What difference does one day make? That's not the point. You promised me a new dress when you sold the picture. How much longer am I to go about in those rags? You're going to paint! - But Musette... - Go on, go on! (Schaunard laughing) The stronger sex! (laughing) The sons of the gods, lords of the earth! (Schaunard scoffs) Slaves of the petticoats. Whining weaklings! (scoffs) (Mimi laughing) (dramatic orchestral music) (sweet orchestral music) - Finished! - Finished? - Finished! - Oh, it's wonderful! This house is a palace, and we're all kings and queens. And if our majesties can raise 10 francs, we'll have a royal banquet. (Musette and Colline laughing) I'm glad it's finished. Another day of Pegasus, and I'd have stood up for the rest of my life. But think of all the new dresses I shall be able to buy you now. - Finished? - Yes. We are ready to be hung in the Louvre between Leonardo and Raphael. - Finished! - Finished! Finished! (all laughing) And today we celebrate. First we'll have a drink at the Mon-moos, and then... No, first we'll all go together and hand in our work. I shall go to my publisher. And I shall go to the salon. And then we shall receive our welcome at the National Theatre. (all laughing) (knocking at window) Huh? I've brought a play. Drama or comedy? - Well, it's a drama... - Five acts, I know. 16,783. Your name and address. (script thuds) We'll keep it here till you call for it. Call for it? You don't think we send 'em back, do you? (window bangs) (people laughing) - Hey! (Mimi singing) - Ah! (all laughing and exclaiming) So you've come back to life at last. We have. Well, you all look very prosperous. - We are. - I know you're going to ask me to be your guest; consider it settled, come on. Oh, it's just like old times. Everything's the same except the girls. [Rodolphe] Oh, no, it's all quite different now. Rodolphe, we haven't played billiards for weeks. That's an idea. But not a very good one. (all chuckling) I can see the old times are over. (all exclaiming) (people murmuring) Mm. Good day, Monsieur Schaunard. Oh, good day, good day, good day. Look, look, Monsieur Barbemouche. - Ah. - Hello. Welcome, fellow artists. Where have you been all this time? Won't you introduce me to the ladies? May I join you? I too am an artist. Indeed? And what sort of an artist, may I ask? And what kind of pots? (all tittering) [Player] Now who would like to play me? [Schaunard] I would! - Five francs in the pool. - Why bother? It's mine already. Five francs in the pool. What are we going to do now? [Marcel] What about going to the Prado? Mme, we'd better see if we've got any money first. - Ah ha. - Come on, let's have it. Here we go. (coins clinking) That's right. Now, one, two, three, four. Five francs and one sou! Look here, I can double our money, I have found a pigeon. Ah! (coins clinking) - Hey, stop it! - No! Order what you like. [Musette] Schaunard! To think that our fate should depend on the meeting of three pieces of ivory. (billiard balls clacking) 94. (Schaunard chuckling) 94. And now for 95. (billiard balls clacking) (Schaunard groaning) Oh what else? 94 against, um, against... What was his little score? 45 at the moment. Then I think I can safely go and have a little drink. (players chuckling) Waiter! (people laughing) Waiter, six more cognacs. - What's the score? - Have you won? Not yet, but almost: 94 against practically nothing. Bravo! (party applauding) Order what you like, now you're my guests. Finish the game quickly so we can pay the bill and go somewhere else. Don't worry, only six more shots. 95, 96, 97. 99. 100. - And game! (spectators applauding) - Bravo! And now I'll go and have a little drink. (spectators laughing) (party laughing) [Waiter] Please. Ah, yes, yes, will you come back in a minute? Monsieur Schaunard has the money. [Musette] Hey, come and pay the bill. (people murmuring) The bill. Oh, yes, of course. Would you be kind enough to lend me a pencil? [Musette] Oh. Didn't you win? Where's our money? Gone. (snaps fingers) Vanished. I knew something like this would happen. Why did you let him take our money? - But I didn't. - Why didn't we go to a decent place? - But could we? - Why do you stand there doing nothing? Musette, don't you... You don't understand, I'm sick and tired of all this. And of you too! (people laughing) - Musette! Musette! Musette! (door bangs) (overlapping voices) Go on, get the police! (people exclaiming) (people laughing) If you please, I (speaking faintly). Oh, well, please. Gentlemen, don't worry, everything has been settled. - Settled? - How? Your friend has paid. What impertinence. Who do you think my friends are, to let a pot maker pay for their refreshment? Do you play billiards? I'm afraid not very well. Good! Then I'll be a sport and play you double or quits. Champagne for my friends! Monsieur Barbemouche! (bar patrons murmuring) (rain pattering) Can't you put these things somewhere else? (clattering) How do you expect me to work in the middle of all this? Oh, I'm sorry, darling. But everything's gone wrong. Colline's book's been turned down. Marcel's painting has been refused. He lost Musette too. And I've been waiting for weeks and weeks and haven't heard a word about my play. But they haven't sent it back. Not yet. Do you think it'd be a good idea if I went to see them... Oh, no, no, it would be beneath our dignity. Poor little hands. They work all day long, while I do nothing. You stay home too much, you ought to relax. Look, it's stopped raining. Why don't you go down to the cafe and see some of your friends? (soft music) Yes, I think will. That's right, come on. - Oh, Mimi. - Oh, I know you'll be bored. But for my sake. All right, for your sake. Here's your coat. (orchestral music) There. Run along. (swelling orchestral music) Mademoiselle Mimi is here. Here? Why, show her in! (jewellery clinking) Mimi. You're quite a stranger. It wasn't easy to come. But you once said... - That your little home would be waiting for you to return to. Well, it's still waiting. There's no need for excuses or apologies, I understand. I said you'd come back one day. But, but you don't understand. I'm not coming back. Oh, I see. Can't we talk like friends? Then what can I do for you? I need your help. Rodolphe in trouble? - Yes. - Hmm. - Money. - Oh, no, no, no. He's written a play. He brought it here, oh, weeks ago. [Lamotte] Oh, how very interesting. - But know how slow they are, we can't get it read. I shouldn't worry about that, it will never be produced. But I thought perhaps you could... But my dear, it is impossible. Imagine the first play of an unknown author at the National Theatre. I might have known you'd say that. You always try to keep the young people out because you're afraid they might do better than yourself. Rodolphe is a genius. Oh, he's a genius? - Yes, he is. - Do you love him so much? - I do! - So much that you really believe that? - Oh, yes. How else do you imagine I could have endured all this? If I didn't believe in him so utterly I couldn't go on. What? Oh, I don't know. Of course, if he is a genius, if he's a genius, I must help him. I'll arrange for the play to be read. - Do you really mean that? - Naturally. Oh. Thank you. - There we are, up! - Up! Down. (men chuckling) Rodolphe, Rodolphe! A letter from the National Theatre! Oh. (speaking faintly) invite you to read your play tomorrow, Wednesday at 11 o'clock in the morning to the Actors' Committee! - Oh! (Rodolphe laughing) But today's Wednesday, it's about 11 now. - Today? - Oh, yes, I remember, Durand said it had been there since yesterday. Oh! I must have a black coat! - Yes, black. - A black coat. Go without a black coat. Genius is genius whatever it wears. Oh, no, no, no no. No, they'd forgive me for writing a bad play, but never for wearing the wrong coat. - Black? - Yes. I believe I've got one! Well, why didn't you say so? (thumping) That's it, ah, here we are. (thumping) Oh Lord! (all groaning) If only you worked as hard as the moths. [Rodolphe] I must have a black coat! [Mimi] Well, where are we going to get one? Excuse me, I only wanted to, I am looking for Monsieur Marcel, the painter. Well, have a look and go. There's your black coat! Monsieur Schaunard was good enough to pay me the most charming compliments about the shape of my head. He wants to be painted. And he suggested that you might be persuaded to... He's about your size. - You'd better come another... - Another few steps nearer, please. There. Marcel! It's lucky that you came today. Monsieur Marcel has to go away for a few days. I think he ought to start on you at once. I feel I ought to have something to eat. Oh, later; do you mind taking off your coat? - Take off my coat? - Yes. I specially put it on to be painted in. My Aunt Emily always says... Oh no no no, I see you in something much more colourful. Yes, Marcel, the Indian cashmere. Please. Besides, this one would look so mean. Black is the cheapest colour. Kindly take care of this. Monsieur Marcel has various dressing gowns ready for every possible occasion. I'm quite sure he'll be only too ready to lend you one. Ah, that's better! (orchestral music) The Emperor of Brazil was the last person to be painted in this particular one. (people speaking faintly) It's 10 minutes past 11. (tuts) The young man must be very sure of himself to keep the Actors Committee waiting. I'm very sorry, I, I only received the letter a half an hour ago. Lucky for you, young man, we couldn't have begun in any case. Madame Sidonie hasn't arrived yet; take a seat. Ladies and gentlemen, please. (someone clears throat) [Servant] Madame Sidonie. - Good morning, everybody. - Morning, madame. - Morning. - Morning, gentlemen. Oh, I hope I'm not late; surely you weren't waiting for me? But who do you think detained me? The Duke himself, such an attractive man! And he would insist on driving me through the Bois. And guess whom we met? Madame Rachel, she went green with jealousy. But the Duke... - Madame Sidonie, do you mind if we begin? Begin? Oh, yes, of course, of course, let's begin. Boheme. Characters: the poor poet, the grisette, the painter, the composer. Excuse me; haven't the characters any names? Oh yes, yes, but we'll get to know them in the course of the play. I wanted to suggest that these figures are typical of the young artists in the Latin Quarter. [Lamotte] Oh, a play of today, you mean? Oh, yes, yes, a play of quite ordinary people, Monsieur Lamotte, like you and me. (chuckling) Charming of you to include me, but... My dear Lamotte, we came to hear the play, not you. (women laughing) If you please. Act one, an attic. Th moonlight is coming through the window. It is a cold night, and the painter, the philosopher, and the poet sit freezing round the stove, which the poet is trying to keep alight by burning his manuscripts. - Will it take much longer? - sh! You mustn't talk while he's painting. But I'm getting hungry. So am I, I haven't had a decent meal since, since, uh, breakfast. Aunt Emily says that regular meals are the foundation of health and strength, and if I don't get a nice tender beef steak soon... I'll get you one. Will you really? It must be a large juicy red one. Get three, you'll be my guests. Of course, if you insist. Where's my purse? (chuckling) Of course, in my coat. (Musette and Barbemouche laughing) You didn't suppose we were going to let you pay for it? - Please, give me my coat. - Now, not another word, otherwise I shall be really cross with you. Very well. How much have you got? I haven't a sou. (coins clinking) Is that all? But it isn't enough. Oh, what shall we do? Get a nice, large, juicy, red horse steak for one. No, I don't like it and I won't have it. You ordered it and you've got to have it. I told you to paint me a horse for my shop window! Well, that is a horse. Look here, lady, I ask you as an impartial witness, is that a horse? Well, it's a sort of horse. There you are, what did I tell you? Look, it's none of my business, but I know a real artist. He'll paint you a horse that won't spoil a customer's appetite. Ah, that's the kind of horse I want. (laughing) You shall have it. (butcher chuckling) Musette, Musette! Stop! Musette! Musette! Oh! Oh Mimi darling, how lovely to see you again. How are you, what are you doing? How is Marcel? Is he still suffering because of me? - Oh, terribly! - Oh, I'm so glad. Is he working? Well, no, he's not suffering that much. (laughing) Dear Marcel, nothing could ever take his place. Except a few pretty dresses. Well, a girl must have something to wear. Besides isn't this lovely? And here's my Venetian costume for the ball tomorrow. You know, at the Prado. Oh yes, of course, the Prado. Oh, Mimi, come with me. Oh no, I couldn't do that, not without Rodolphe. How is Rodolphe? Are things going better with you now? Oh, oh, yes. Oh Mimi, your hands are so cold. (Mimi coughing) You're feeling well? Oh, I'm quite all right, and this isn't for us. I see. Oh, Mimi, I never paid you back those 20 francs. What 20 francs? When have I ever had 20 francs to lend you? Oh, please, take it. Oh but we don't need it. Why, at this very moment Rodolphe is reading his play at the National Theatre. - Oh, but that's splendid! - Oh, he's going to be rich and famous! Yes, but not too famous, I hope. Why, what do you mean? Oh nothing, only, you know how women run after a celebrity. Society women, important hostesses, fashionable actresses. The happiest girl in Paris. The curtain falls slowly. The End. [Sidonie] It's beautiful. Yes, but I think I'm speaking in the name of my respective colleagues when I ask whether play should be considered as romantic or classical. But surely the question you have to decide is whether the play is good or bad. That is the question, and it is good. Perhaps, but to my mind, it is highly improper. Then you must have a highly improper mind. (rapping) Ladies and gentlemen, arguments are against the rules. Let us put it to the vote. Then I say... Far too much! (people laughing) My dear friends, this is not a question of the play being classical or romantic, moral or immoral, but it is a question of youth or age. And this is a play of youth. Those of you who are young and who support youth, vote yes.! I knew you would agree. [Commissioner] Ladies and gentlemen, the play is accepted. (all exclaiming) - Congratulations! (all chattering) Congratulations. I've been waiting a long time for a part like this. (people speaking faintly) Baron, I wish we could have the first rehearsal tomorrow. If you wish it, Madame, I will see to it. (people chattering) Thank you, sir. How can I ever thank you? By not speaking of thanks. It's marvellous, but there's a scene in the second act which I don't quite feel. I think it might be a good idea if we were to discuss it. (Sidonie coos) She's inviting him to tea. Mme, the usual procedure. If she enjoys her cup of tea, he can count on 200 performances. I wonder what the Duke will say? Nothing, so long as they don't meet at breakfast. (all laughing) But Mimi, you're asking me to sell a work of art to hang in the window of a butcher's shop. Yes, but I thought you wanted to go to the Venetian Ball. Yes. But a horse butcher's shop. Mimi, Marcel, my play, they've taken it! [Mimi And Marcel] Sh! (all laughing) And the first rehearsal's tomorrow. I always knew they'd take it! I know you did. But your friend Lamotte almost ruined everything. Did he? But I had a friend, Madame Sidonie. [Marcel] Madame Sidonie? You should have seen her, the way she handled Lamotte. (laughing) You must paint her, Marcel. At present I'm painting horses for butchers. I'll talk to Madame Sidonie. You'll be famous overnight. Imagine my feelings. There was Lamotte, looking like this. But then Madame Sidonie, I've waited years for a play like this. It's a play of life, something new, something different! I'll never be able to thank her. Can you believe it? She insisted on playing the part in my play. And then she invited me to come and see her, and talk things over. Oh, Mimi give my coat a brush, will you? And then after the reading, you should have seen her. Madame Sidonie took my arm like this, just as if we were old friends. (door bangs) (orchestral music) I tell you, this is the greatest day of my life. Mimi? Where's Mimi gone? Mimi! Mimi? Yes? Anything wrong? No, why? Just wondered. Where's my other shirt? - In the second drawer. - Ah. (Rodolphe humming happily) ♪ Da dum bum hum hum ♪ ♪ Dee dee dee dee dee ♪ ♪ Dee dee dee ♪ What do you think of Lamotte behaving like that? Mimi, come and help me. Tell me, what do you think? Was he just being spiteful, or or is he still in love with you? Well why didn't you ask him? (Rodolphe chuckling) What a difference between men and women. Hmm, Lamotte would ruin my career simply because his vanity has been hurt, whereas Madame Sidonie, who's much more famous, is only too anxious to help an unknown writer. (brush clatters) - Here's your coat. Oh. And, Mimi, her dress, so elegant. I've had clothes, you know. Oh, now you're being reproachful. I suppose I should apologise for being so poor. Of course, if you regret anything... I don't wait until there's anything to regret. So I've noticed. (object clattering) Darling, how can you be so unfair? You know why I left Lamotte. Yes, yes, yes, I know. I know all the things you said to me you did, but I suppose clothes were the real trouble there too. (Mimi sobs) (orchestral music) (Mimi weeping) Oh, Mimi, oh darling, I didn't mean it. Oh, sweet. Mimi come on. Come on. Oh, darling, smile, smile, smile, sweet. (chuckling) We've longed so much for this day, dreamed of all the lovely things we'd do, and they were pretty grand dreams too. Unknown author's first play at the National Theatre. Why, without Madame Sidonie, we never... I counted, that's the 10th time you've mentioned her name since you came home. In fact you haven't talked about anything else. (chuckling) So that's it. Yes, Rodolphe. And I feel worse because I can't help thinking of what Musette said to me just an hour ago. Then you'll bring in the tea, and you'll not interrupt any more. You see we have to discuss the new play. And if anyone asks for Madame, I'm not at home. Not even to the Duke? No, not even to the Duke. And so I thought Musette was right. Nonsense, do you think I'd ever let you go? But Rodolphe, I... (smooching) Be quiet. Your hands are cold, aren't you well? I heard you coughing last night. Oh darling, everything's all right as long as you love me. (orchestral music) But now you must go, otherwise you'll be late for Madame Sidonie. Ah, I counted, that's the 13th time you've mentioned her name, and 13's an unlucky number, so I'm going to stay here. But you can't do that, think of your play! No, I mustn't spoil Madame, what's her name? Because I don't care if there are 100 Madame what's-her-names were waiting and if all the plays in the world depended on Madame what's-her name, I'd still stay here with you. (orchestral music) [Sidonie] I greet you. [Chorus] Hail, the Queen. [Sidonie] Oh, a little louder, ladies, please. I greet you! [Chorus] Hail, the Queen! That's better, thank you, ladies, thank you. Good morning, Monsieur Lamotte. Good morning. [Assistant] Thank you, ladies. Madame Sidonie, please forgive me, but yesterday it was impossible to... Please, could you tell me what... Well, uh (people speaking faintly). Baron Pierre. Baron Pierre, please tell me what's happening here. I thought the first rehearsal was fixed for today. It's been postponed. Postponed? For how long? - Indefinitely. [Marcel] I can't do it, I can't. Musette will be dancing tonight at the Venetian Ball. With Her Russian count! What are you grumbling about? Your painting's going to be hung. Not in the Louvre, but it's going to be hung, whereas my play is buried forever in the catacombs of the National Theatre. Perhaps when she sees you at the Prado... There's no love like an old love. Very well. It's quite simple. Green for the trees. - Yep. Black for the horse, and blue for the sky. - Ah. I'll take care of Musette. Well, that's finished. (brush clattering) And now for the butcher! And then the fancy dresses! My friends, we are our own men again. Poor, down at heel, and happy. (party-goers laughing) (orchestral music) (party-goers chattering) (party-goers chattering) (fanfare music) Ladies and gentlemen! Monsieur Jacque Offenbach has composed a new piece in honour of this occasion, and he will now have the pleasure of presenting it for the first time in public. La Barcarolle. (audience murmuring) (audience applauding) La Barcarolle! (laughing) In 12 months it'll be forgotten! [Man] Hey! (sentimental classical music) Not a sign of Musette. I've sold my art, my birthright, for a mess of horseflesh. (Rodolphe chuckling( - Oh well, cheer up. Come on, we will find her. - Huh? - Marcel! - What is it? - Nothing, nothing. - But who is that? My brooch, I've lost my brooch! Oh, oh, well I'll buy you another one, a more expensive one. No no no, it was your very first present to me. Oh, yes I remember. Stop by the steps, please. ("La Bacarole" by Jacques Offenbach) And now we will find the brooch. I know where I lost it. - Well may I come with you? - No, you cannot. You wait here. ("La Bacarole" by Jacques Offenbach) Oh go away, go away, all of you! (crowd laughing) [Musette] Why should such a handsome hero be so serious? You don't man to tell me you have lost your sweetheart? Well never mind, I will make up for her. (crowd exclaiming) (crowd laughing) - Musette! (Marcel and crowd laughing) Musette! (crowd laughing) ("La Bacarole" by Jacques Offenbach) (audience applauding) (audience cheering) (audience applauding) I thought you said you were out yesterday. I was out. You should get rid of your maid. Why? I stood outside the house, she was in your boudoir the whole time, wearing your negligee. (Sidonie laughing) [Captain] It is forbidden to sit with one man the whole evening. In the name of the Doge of Venice and the Council of 10, we have orders to arrest you and throw you into the dungeon. But Captain, one moment, please, it's the Duke. Is that the Prince himself? Yes. [Captain] Quick march! Right, left, right, left, right. On an occasion like this, a mask makes all man equal, even a duke. (orchestral music) Captain, Captain, please! See that young man down there? [Captain] The fat one? No, the tall one beside him. Arrest him and put him into the dungeon. But don't you say who told you to do it. [Captain] As your loveliness wishes. I pray you, sir, to excuse me. What are you going to do? I'm going to play a little carnival comedy, in which there is no part for you. [Captain] Gentlemen, hey you! In the name of the Doge of Venice and the Council of 10, we have orders to arrest you and throw you into the dungeon. - Where are your orders? - Here! - I refuse! - Oh no, but you must go, it's fun! - Yes. All right. [Captain] Come on, away, away to the dungeon. Off with him, take him away! (laughing) Oh Colline, if they take you away too... [Lamotte] Then you would come back to me. That sounds Just like an actor's voice. (laughing) Oh, no it isn't, it's Monsieur Lamotte. An old friend, a faithful friend. Do you know him, Colline? - No. - Do you mind, young man? - How do you do? - How do you do? Mimi, there's so much I want to say. (chuckling) Colline, don't go far. - I'll be waiting. - I shan't minute. Well? Mimi, wouldn't you like to come back to me? Why? Wouldn't you like Rodolphe's play to be put on? Oh, the villain setting his price. (chuckling) Do you know why it wasn't put on before? Because of you. (orchestral music) Me? Yes, because... (orchestral music) (audience exclaiming) The orders of the Council of 10 have been carried out. Left tum, quick march. (orchestral music) (audience chattering) (Sidonie laughing) (orchestral music) Well, have you anything to say in your defence? Nothing. You know the charge? No. You're the first man who ever kept Madame Sidonie waiting. What was your reason? Or should I say who? Who is correct. Then you have the effrontery to make another woman your excuse? Surely the judge will understand that I... Are you in love with her? Yes. That sounds interesting. (Musette laughing) And you mean to tell us that you knew me all the time? An artist must recognise the only picture in his heart. What about the other picture? You know the... - Uh, I sold it. Sold it? Good! Where's it hanging, in the Louvre? Mm, not exactly, but not far from the Louvre. Would you like to see it? - Tomorrow. - Now. - Now? (rain pattering) it's beautiful! You see, I wanted to meet you at the ball, but I hadn't any money. Oh, as if that mattered. That canvas was going to hang in the Louvre, and it's hanging in a butcher's shop. Our love was going to be one long sunny day, and it's ending on a rainy night. Ending? Oh! [Marcel] Musette! What has loving me got to do with it? Everyone knows she stopped rehearsals. Dear Mimi, don't you realise that you're interfering with his career? He can find another theatre. But not another Sidonie to help him fight his battles for him. - I can do that. Dear Mimi, I know you love him, to you he's a genius. If he is, then he's outgrown you. He must always go forward. You had to be the one to give him the impetus to push ahead. Now he must be free to grow. You know it. If you really care for him, there's only one way to help him. (Mimi sighs) (fan snaps) I must say, it's a new experience for me to listen to a man raving about some other woman. (Rodolphe laughing) Where is your Mimi? I'd love to meet her. - Would you? And rehearsals will start tomorrow. Then I'm forgiven? (orchestral music) Well. Well? Things seem to have arranged themselves, don't they? Sidonie's rather persuasive. Do you remember our Thursday evenings? Do you still meet at the Folies Bergere? It's not the same without you. (Mimi laughing) (orchestral music) It happens to be Thursday today. It does. Well. Let's go. - Come on! (orchestral music) (crowd chattering) (people laughing) (people chattering) (rain pattering) Mimi! (people laughing) (people chattering) [Man] Oh, Mimi. Mimi, we are so glad to see you here. (people laughing) [Man] Mimi, please, won't you sing for us? (people exclaiming) [Man] Sing us the old tune. (audience applauding) - Hooray! Ah! ♪ Love over all ♪ ♪ For joy or for sorrow ♪ ♪ If he come your way ♪ ♪ Never say him nay ♪ ♪ Answer his call ♪ ♪ Today or tomorrow ♪ ♪ Greet him gladly ♪ ♪ Madly ♪ (Mimi weeping) (orchestral music) Mimi. No. No! (orchestral music) (people speaking faintly) (people laughing faintly) [Painter] I realise you think your heart is broken, but presently you'll forget. I shall never forget her, all the, all the fame, all the success in the world can never replace her. She was my life, now she's gone. It hurts, I tell you, it hurts. Stop please, stop! Excuse me, sir. You spoke that speech as if you were saying, "Have my trousers come back from the tailors?" The line, my friend, is, it hurts, it hurts. Do you know what that means? Can you feel? Do you know what it means to love someone? Love them so much that they're a part of you? That their life is your life, their breath is your breath, their soul, your soul. Have you ever felt that? Have you? If you haven't, you can't act it. Have you ever lost that person and felt an emptiness so big that all life couldn't fill it? It is to be without arms or legs, it's to be an empty shell. It is to realise that one's very existence depends on that person, and you've lost her. She's gone, left you. No trace, nothing anywhere. She's gone, the one reason for living, she's gone, and taken your soul with her! Don't you see? It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts! (soft music) If only I knew where she was. (soft music) Aren't they pretty? You're so kind. Mimi, won't you please let me tell Rodolphe? Oh, no, no, no! You swore to me. If I didn't know I could trust you, I wouldn't have sent you word. (coughing) But Mimi, if only you knew how unhappy he's been ever since he discovered that you hadn't gone back to Lamotte. He's never stopped searching for you in all the places you used to go together. He swears he will find you. Oh, I'm glad he hasn't forgotten me. But he will forget me. The rehearsals going well? Oh yes, the first performance will be early in the autumn. Early in the autumn. Nothing can interrupt them now. Doctor, Doctor, tell me the truth. Every time I come here, she seems weaker and weaker. It's not only her illness. She seems to have no will to live. Autumn is coming. If we can only get her safely through the critical time, when the leaves begin to fall. [Colline] Is there nothing I can do, Doctor? Give her back the will to live. I'm going to tell Rodolphe. No, no! Colline, Colline! (Mimi weeping) (soft music) - How is she? - She, Rodolphe. She needs you. (orchestral music) Rodolphe! Mimi. (orchestral music) Oh Rodolphe, you shouldn't have come. We belong to each other. Not for today, but forever. Forever! Forever. (knocking at door) - Hmm? Very warm for the time of the year. Seems autumn won't ever begin. Monsieur Rodolphe! A letter for you. May I... - Oh, Monsieur Durand, yes, come right here, don't be afraid. (Marcel chuckling) - Here it is. From Marcel, from London! Oh! (clears throat) Very warm for the time of the year. Seems autumn will never begin. You have been looking better and better every day since you came back. Oh, I like to hear you say that. Oh, well. Marcel's all the rage in London. The papers are full of it, how an English lord discovered a great genius in a Paris butcher's shop. (both chuckling) And he's telling everybody it's due to you. Oh, isn't that nice, I am glad. When I first met you, you were a lazy lot. Oh. Must you work all the time? Mm, it's gotta be finished for the first night. Your first night! Oh. - No, look out! - Ow. Did I hurt you? No, you mustn't kiss me, the doctors... The doctors were wrong, they're always wrong. (soft music) After the first night, we'll have lots of money. We'll go south somewhere, Italy, or Greece perhaps. Then you can lie in the sun all day long. (soft music) (melancholy music) (orchestral music) Please, Musette, I shall be quite all right here alone. We've all been living for tonight, I mustn't stop you going. Even if I can't. Oh but the play isn't only for tonight. Marcel says everybody says that it'll run 100 nights at least. We'll all see it together. Oh, I... Musette, do you think I shall see it, ever? Oh it would make me so happy. (clock striking) I do want to live. And you will live, you must live, for Rodolphe. (clock striking) The theatre must be full by this time. They're lowering the lights (audience murmuring) The stove's the only one to welcome my play. You only bought the piano to have something to stand your pictures on. You know the whole play by heart. Now, Musette, they must have reached the big scene, the dangerous scene. Will they applaud or... And I picked you up out of the gutter! (audience exclaiming) - Curtain! - Well, I've had enough! (audience exclaiming) - Curtain! Disgusting, immoral! What's going on, dear? Darling, it's the most dreadful play I ever heard. You don't know a good play when you see one! (audience cheering) I can't even take my wife to the National Theatre! - Curtain! - Come on my dear, come. Curtain! (people exclaiming) Curtain down! (people clamouring) (audience booing) Better ring down the curtain. Shut up! (audience applauding) Shut up! Shut up! Men and women of France, the man that wrote this play is my friend. (audience murmuring) He went cold and hungry to write it, just as hundreds and thousands of other young artists in Paris go cold and hungry. Because they believe, because they know, they have a mission to fulfil. (audience cheering) (audience applauding) I don't care whether his play is good or not, but I do know one thing, it's honest, it's sincere! Why don't you be honest and sincere? At least listen to his play before you condemn it and save your verdict till the end! (audience murmuring) (audience applauding weakly) (audience applauding loudly) And from that moment, success was never in doubt. You can't imagine what a success. I couldn't wait any longer. I rushed off in the middle of the performance. I wanted to be the first to tell you. Colline, if there was room for anyone else in my heart but Rodolphe... Would you care to kiss me? (clock ticking) Go now, don't miss the end. Did you see how red he went? He's hopelessly in love with you. What will he do while you're away? You'll have to comfort him. I'm not his type, and he's not mine. I've talked it all over with Rodolphe. When we come back, we're going to have a little house in the country, and Colline is coming to live with us. I see, quite a happy family. (both laughing) (Mimi coughing) (clock ticking) It'll soon be over now. (audience applauding) (audience cheering) (audience exclaiming) (people clamouring) Rodolphe! (people chattering) (people exclaiming) (audience applauding) (people chattering) Perhaps there is something in Mimi's theory after all. I shall begin to work too. Starting next Monday on. (Colline chuckling) (audience cheering) (audience applauding) I had to kiss you, it's been so wonderful! Thank you, excuse me, but I must... I know, I know, go to your Mimi. Give her these flowers and tell her she's the happiest girl in Paris. (audience applauding) (speaking in foreign language) Is she asleep? (sombre music) (melancholy music) The happiest girl in Paris. (orchestral music) Happiest girl. (orchestral music) (dramatic music) (orchestral music)
