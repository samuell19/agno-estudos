In ancient times, the licensed fool was allowed to speak while the others held their peace. So perhaps I, as an avowedly comic artist, may be allowed to speak first. The comic artist is the guardian of reality. It is his privilege to remind the public what they really look like and to destroy their happy illusions of dignity and beauty, so sedulously built up by the advertising artist and the Royal Academician. But there are many other illusions. For instance, the illusion that compared to the romance and mystery of High Tibet or the rolling prairies and limitless expanse of the golden West, Great Britain is rather a dim little island. The illusion that compared to those talented Central Europeans, flogging the pianoforte for a very substantial remuneration, we are a hopelessly unmusical nation. And of course that now as always the country is going to the dogs. Ichabod, Ichabod, our glory is departed. Perhaps you may remember a Victorian painting of emigrants, called The Last of England. It was painted in 1852. To us, looking back, a time of optimism, expansion and the Great Exhibition. But this was not, I fancy, the reality which the departing emigrants observed. For them, England was the land of the 12-hour day, suffering from the effects of the Hungry Forties, menaced by the dangerous imperialism of Napoleon III, its faith undermined by Mr Darwin. Many of these things were indeed realities. The illusion was the supposed resulting collapse of Britain. The first iron ship in the world was launched on the Tyne in 1852. And for nearly a century, British yards were building ships better than other people, cheaper and quicker, banging and clattering with technique and skill constantly improving. And men were proud to call themselves craftsmen. Then we ran into trouble. The world slump hit the Tyne broadside. In the olden days, the father passed on his skill to his son. Then the introduction of machinery tended to take away the skill more and more and we, the shipbuilders and engineers, neglected, in the altered circumstances, to train the apprentices. Most of our shipyards were practically closed for five years and only started to get busy again under the threat of approaching war. This is a secret place. Trespassers trespass at their peril. It's called Minsmere, on the Suffolk coast. A bird reserve, managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds. During the war it was a protected area of another kind. And where the assault course was laid out, shelducks now rear their broods in peace, under the protective eye of the watcher. Wild nature in Britain. What's the use of it? I'll tell you. It's interesting. We learn from it. It's beautiful. We refresh ourselves with it. It's fun. We take pleasure in it. This chap's on the edge of Scotland. 600 miles from London on the cliffs by Cape Wrath, the northwest tip of Britain. You don't have to go to the Arctic or the tropics to explore. There's plenty still to do in Britain. Human life is withdrawing, receding from the remote northwest. The land is slipping back to nature and becoming a wild treasure ground, a wild pleasure ground for the inquiring naturalist. Here's the contrast. The industry that keeps us alive. It's all over the place. You can't get away from it? Nonsense. Of course you can. For five bob you can get from almost any industrial city of the north to country like this, Malham Cove and Gordale Scar in the limestone country of the Craven Pennines, part of one of the proposed national parks. ♪ As it fell out upon one day ♪ Rich Diverus he made a feast ♪ And he invited all his friends ♪ And gentry of the best... ♪ Listen to that tune. It is one of our English folk tunes. I knew it first when I was quite a small boy. But I realised even then that here was something not only very beautiful but which had a special appeal to me as an Englishman. It dates from a time when people of necessity made their own music and when, as has been well said, they made what they liked and liked what they made. I'd like to think of our musical life as a great pyramid, at the apex of which are the great virtuosi performers and composers of international renown. Then, immediately below this, come those devoted musical practitioners, true artists, who by precept and example, are spreading the knowledge and love of music in our schools, our choral societies, our musical festivals. Then comes the next layer of our musical structure, that great mass of musical amateurs who make music for the love of it in their spare time, and play and sing for their own spiritual recreation in their homes. And then below that again as a foundation we have those great tunes which like our language, our customs, our laws, are the groundwork upon which everything must stand. So perhaps we are not so unmusical after all. Nevertheless, our music has lain dormant. Occasionally indeed, a candle would shine like a good deed in a naughty world, Byrd, Purcell or Arne. And lately the candles have become more numerous. For people have come to find in our music a special message, which that of other nations, however skilled and imaginative, cannot give them. But it's not all going to be easy. Nature's hard to manage. We'll sometimes have to ration the fun we get out of it. If we don't preserve and cherish it, if we don't go on learning, finding out about it, we may hurt it or even lose it. But today we can no longer build ships better than Sweden or quicker than the Americans. Ichabod, Ichabod, our glory is departed. Have we really lost our touch as shipbuilders? Have we lost it as a nation? No, I don't think we really have. There is one very big thing in our favour, that we are good sailors. We have always been, and we know we are still. But we need more work from below and more drive from the top. If we can get supplies, if we don't take things too easily, two very big "ifs", we can still compete. Doubtless, were we a rational race, the spectacle of our present position would overwhelm us. Then we've always, thank heaven, remained deaf to appeals to reason. We're convinced that the experts are invariably wrong. And at Dunkirk, which was the illusion and which the reality? So, the fire is ready to be kindled, and only requires a match to be lighted to set the whole ablaze. Some great upheaval of national consciousness and emotion. The Elizabethans experienced this, and as a result they produced poetry and music such as has never been surpassed. Have we not also experienced lately such a national upheaval? And is not the reason why, during the late war, those who had never taken music seriously before began to crowd our concert halls from Kensington to Haringey to hear a symphony concerts? Today, our music, which so long had seemed without life, has been born again. Who can talk of an end, when we're scarcely at the beginning?
