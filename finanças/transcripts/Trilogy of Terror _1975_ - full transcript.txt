Hmm, whoa, the one in the dress. Hi, how you doing? Math class. Oh there you go. Oh, your coat's terrific. The whole thing's terrific. God, have you ever seen so many dogs in one place? Oh, the trouble with you Chad is you're just spoiled. Yeah, I know. Good morning. Now that's ugly. I just got the weirdest idea. Yeah, what? I wonder what she looks like under all those clothes. Who, Eldridge? Are you kidding? No, I'm not kidding. It's kind of like the idea just jumped into my head. Basic literary triangle. Can anyone tell me why Fitzgerald's name is on the bottom? Mr. Foster. Because Fitzgerald's liberated work of the 20's beginning with "This Side Of Paradise", formed the base for the extended realism of both Hemingway and Faulkner. Quite correct. I would like to amplify this aspect of the discussion, but I see by the clock that our time is up. Your assignment due for tomorrow's class will be the final chapter of "For Whom The Bell Tolls". You are to summarize this chapter with special emphasis on the prognostic time continuum thought processes relating to his father's death and his own impending death in Spain. Class is dismissed. Thank you, Chad. You're welcome. You sure carry a lot of books. Yes. Miss Aldridge, do you go to the movies much? Sometimes, not often. No? I do. A lot. But then I tend to think in pictures. Oh? Yeah, you see my hobby's photography. Well that's very interesting. Well I thought that maybe we could... It's very nice talking with you Chad, but I do have another class. Yeah. See you. You're really serious about that, aren't you? Well if you've got any funny ideas, you'd better forget it. Don't go messing around with teachers. Oh really? Gee, I didn't know that. Going out tonight? No, I have too much to do. You know, for the kind of money they pay you, you put in an awful lot of hours. That's true. Julie, Steve has a friend. He's a very nice guy. But you can't just stay home all the time. You've got to go out some times. I'm all right Ann. Don't worry about me. The problem with you is you don't give yourself half a chance. If you'd work at it just a little, you'd really be attractive. Ann, have a nice time tonight. Okay. Good night. Night. That scene in "Sanctuary" where Faulkner has his character Popeye rape the girl. I prefer Fitzgerald. He only suggests violence. Faulkner was just telling it like it is. I guess some people enjoy violence, lead perverted lives. And speaking of perversion, there's a wonderful little vampire picture playing down at the Village Drive-In this Friday. It's all in French with English subtitles. It's a real classic. How about going to see it with me for reasons of cultural expansion? Well I thank you Chad, but you know, teachers aren't allowed to date students. Or didn't you know that? So, who'll find out? My lips are sealed. I won't tell. You have your pick of all these lovely coeds Chad. Why would you want to date me? Because I prefer maturity in a woman. All those others? They're just a bunch of kids. You look like you could use a drink. Yes I guess I could. It's ridiculous, but these kind of things always upset me. You want popcorn too? Oh no, I couldn't eat anything. But a drink would be fine Chad, thank you. All right. What'll it be? Two large root beers. All right. And easy on the ice. Two large root beers, easy on the ice. How much is that? A dollar. There you go. Thank you. Thank you. Here's your drink. Thank you. Taste's bitter. Yeah, mine too. I guess they're not putting enough syrup in them. What's the matter? Don't you like the movie Chad? Sure I like the movie. It's just that I like you better. What's wrong? I don't know. Do you want to get out and get some air? Can I do something for you? Yeah, I need a room for the night. Me and my wife. The name's Harker. Mr. and Mrs. Jonathan Harker. You got any bags? Yeah I've got baggage. It'll be fifteen dollars in advance. All right. You need to fill out the card? Thank you. Yeah. What time is it? It's late. We're home. Boy you must have really been tired. How could I? Did I really fall asleep? Um-hmm. I'm sorry. I mean this has never happened to me before. I'm just sorry that I took you to such a boring picture. Well I... I warned you at least. I told you I wouldn't be a very exciting date. Forget it. I decided to let you sleep. I figured with all the work you do, you needed the rest. Still I'm afraid I spoiled your evening. No. I had a fine time. Chad, I'm really sorry. Hey, I thought we agreed to forget about that. Yes, we did. I had a very good time, thank you. Can I call you tomorrow? I don't think so Chad. Why not? Because it was foolish of us to go out tonight. I could lose my job and you could be expelled. No board of trustees tells me who to see and who not to see. I do what I want. Now Chad. No, I really must be firm about this. We can't go out again. We'll see. Good night Julie. Hello? It's me, Chad. Chad, It's not even eight o'clock. I want to see you. I told you last night that I don't think we should. Listen, you get dressed because I'm coming over there right now. You and I are taking a little drive together. Absolutely not. Now what's the matter with you? I don't find this at all amusing. It's not meant to be. Are you ready to tell me why you're behaving this way? We?, didn't I tell you? My hobby's photography. You drugged me last night, didn't you? How could you do something this sick? Well I think they came out rather well, don't you? Oh, and you can keep these, because you see, I have the negatives. I'll call the police Chad. No you won't. First of all, you have no proof that I drugged you. I'II deny it, and offer these photos as proof. Tell them you seduced me. That you've got a thing for your students. Now, I'm sure you don't want the police or anyone else to see these. All right Chad. What do you want from me? The realism of Faulkner, Steinbeck, Hemingway and even Hamot opened the doors to a new kind of literary expression, indigenous to the new American frontier experience. Here was a raw muscle prose which completely transformed the period and formed a direct bridge linking us all the way from... from the aesthetic realism of a Dreiser to the rather disheveled... Class is dismissed. Class is dismissed. What are you doing up? Do you know what time it is? Julie... Will you please tell me what's going on? Nothing. I didn't stay up all night to get that kind of answer. I'm worried about you. It's been like this for a month now. I know. Julie, this isn't like you. Please tell me what's happening. I really can't talk about it Ann. Go to bed. Hey, I want that on. I want it off. Since when does what you want count? Since now. Tonight. This second. It's all over Chad. It's over. Nothing is over until I say it is. I don't think so. You see, I'm bored. And when I'm bored, the game is over. Bored? Um-hmm. Not terrified, not shocked. Just plain bored. Who's idea did you think this whole thing was? What are you talking about? What I am talking about Chad, is that you are a singularly, unimaginative young man. Did you really think that that dull little mind of yours could possibly have conceived any of the rather dramatic experiences we've shared? Do you remember the day you watched me walk up the steps? Since that moment, your mind has not been your own. Why do you think you suddenly had the overwhelming desire to see what I looked like, under all those clothes? Don't feel bad. I always get bored after awhile. Although, there was one boy in Denver who did keep me amused for almost nine weeks. But then he was wonderfully creative. First you'll experience dizziness. Then mild paralysis and then total cardiac arrest. You've drugged me. No clear, I've killed you. No! I told you about those chemicals Chad. How dangerous they could be. He was one of your best students, wasn't he? Yes, he was, wonderfully bright and a spirited boy. You know, I warned him about those chemicals, how dangerous they could be. Are you sure you're okay? Julie, I can skip work and stay here with you. No, you go on. I'll be fine. Are you sure? Yes Ann. Miss Aldridge? Yes. I'm Arthur Moore. I saw your notice on the board. And you need help? Yeah, I um... my lit grades are lousy. Do you have time for me Miss Eldridge? Of course I do Arthur. In fact if you like, we can start right now. Oh that'd be great. I'd like that a lot. Good. I think we're going to be friends Arthur. Very good friends. The funeral is over and I'm alone in the house. Therese is out cavorting with one of her men on this night when father is barely cold in his casket. Iran some old family films to remind myself when it began. Even then at twelve, she was already using her wiles on him. Poor mother. So weak, so innocent. Never suspecting the depth of evil in Therese. My spoiled sister. Her sweet little face never fooled me for an instant. I knew the darkness behind it. I knew the fomenting ugliness in her soul. Mr. Anmar? Yes. Please come in. I know what you're thinking. You're wondering how sisters look so unalike. I have never found it necessary to affect the ways of Therese. Please sit down. Is she here? Oh no. She's gone to a party. A party? This afternoon at the funeral, she seemed so distraught. My sister is an unusual girl, Mr. Anmar. I doubt that you truly understand her. Which is why I've called you here. What do you mean? I want you to look at something. Here's Therese and father. She was fifteen then. I want you to notice the way she's pressing herself against him. I, I don't understand. Why are you telling me this? My sister is evil, Mr. Anmar. I think you should know that. Even as a child, she was vicious and cunning. But father worshiped her, and she him. When she was sixteen, she seduced him. Now look, I don't know what you're trying to do, but I don't want to hear any more of this. It was not long after that, that mother died. The doctor said it was an accident. That she had taken an overdose of sleeping pills. But it was no accident, Mr. Anmar. It was Therese. She had put those extra pills in her milk. If this is true, how could you live in the same house while they... Well you see, I had no place else to go. I had no money and no way to earn any. No escape. So, I kept to myself as much as possible, and tried to avoid Therese, to ignore what was happening in this house. You don't believe me, do you? Miss Laura, I don't know what to say. These books show what she is. Demonology. Pornography. Satanism. Voodoo. Witchcraft. These books aren't just relics, Mr. Anmar. She uses them to capture the souls of others. By her own admission, Satan guides her. You don't really expect me to believe this, do you? But you must believe me, Mr. Anmar. You see, Therese's soul is damned. I cannot help her. But I can help you. Miss Monroe, I'm afraid you're the one that really needs help. How naive you are. Do you really think she cares for you? She lies to you. She laughs at you. Sorry, but I really must be going now. I know all about that night at Morley and what happened there. She told you about that? Yes. She told me everything. Gloated. Bragged about how she was able to corrupt you. My sister enjoys inflicting pain, Mr. Anmar. And apparently she somehow persuaded you to share that perversion. Now do you believe me? Now you are saved, Mr. Anmar. I have freed you from evil. This afternoon while I was out shopping, Therese violated my room in an insane act of revenge, and upon my return, raged at me using foul and obscene language, cursing me for having dared to reveal the truth to Mr. Anmar. Her behavior was crude and astral. She's becoming more violent by the day. It's as if father's death has released the demons within her and I actually fear for my life. Hello? Dr. Ramsey, it's Millie. It's about Therese. She's much worse. Oh, I thought we settled that matter. You were going to see about Therese. But you can't imagine the things she's been saying about me. About us. Us? She's jealous of our relationship. She's twisted it into something lewd and something sordid. Look Millie. I have a hospital call to make in your area tomorrow. I'II drop by and we'll talk about this. Thank you doctor. Hi doc. Come on in. I've been expecting you. You want a drink? No thanks. No, course not. I suppose you're here on your usual mission? I know all about what dear little Millicent told you on the phone. I was listening on the extension in my room you see. I see. So, I guess this is just a wasted visit doctor. Because I know Millicent won't talk about me when I'm in the house and here I am. Did you destroy her room? Yes I destroyed her room. Why shouldn't I? She deserved it. I mean where does that little twit get off thinking she's got the right to stick her nose into my affairs. Don't worry doc. I'm sure she's got it all straightened up by now in her proper little housekeeper's manner. Therese, this hatred has got to stop. You'll destroy yourself. Oh, I don't think so doc. Besides, it's really all Millicent has. Her hatred of me is the only passion in her lonely, pathetic little existence. You know, you're really a very handsome man, doctor. If you'd just loosen up a little. Oh, did that bother you? Do I make you nervous, doctor? I don't think we need to carry this any further. What's the matter doc? You still a virgin? Or um... is it that you just don't like girls? I'll call again soon. We don't need you anymore Ramsey. Why don't you just get the hell out of our lives? Don't phone us and don't call on us. Leave, and don't ever come back here. He's gone. Dr. Ramsey's gone Millicent. He won't be back. What do you think of that dear little sister? Answer me you creep. But I wouldn't answer her. Nor would I allow her to enter. I remained locked in my room, silent while she raged and swore at me. Finally, she staggered back into her own room and fell into a drunken sleep. How I loathe her. I could no longer bear to live in this house, and watch evil prevail. Something must be done. Yes. Therese must die. Tracy, what's wrong? What's the matter? My doll is broken. Oh, let me look at it. Oh my. How did this happen dear? Your sister broke it. Therese? Therese did this? But why, why did she do it? I was just playing with my dolly when all of a sudden your sister came running out of the house and yelled at me. She said I was making too much noise. Then she grabbed my dolly and threw it on the ground and broke its head. I hate her, Miss Millicent, I hate her. You poor thing. Next time I'm in town, I'm going to buy you a brand new dolly. You will? Will that make you feel better? Thank you Miss Millicent. When I returned to the house, I was still thinking of Tracy's broken doll. And it was then that the solution suddenly became quite clear. At last, I had found the ideal way. How ironic. I would use Therese's own books to destroy her. I began to collect the necessary items. Parings from Therese's long painted nails. Strands from her lovely blonde hair. The rhinestone buttons from her most Iedey seductive dress. And then at last, I had all that was required. Therese's life, held literally within my hands. Hello? Hello Dr. Ramsey. It's Millie. I've been trying to reach you since yesterday. Millie, I'm terribly worried. We must talk. I appreciate the concern doctor, but I no longer feel there is any need to talk. You see, things are different now. I've found a way to deal with Therese. I insist that we talk. That is all I have to say to you Dr. Ramsey. Your advice is no longer required. Good bye. Millicent? Millie? Millie, are you in here? Millicent? This is Dr. Chester Ramsey, 470 Stetton Place. I want to report a death, female, age twenty six. Cause of death... Cause of death unknown. Just a moment, before you take her away. I was the family physician. I knew her quite well. Her name was Therese Millicent Larimore. The most advanced case of dual personality I have ever seen. He who kills. Boy are you ugly. That face. Even your mother wouldn't love you. Very sharp. Arthur's going to love it. Well, better get it over with. Hi mom. I couldn't call earlier. I just got home. Mother, mother it's about tonight. I know we always spend Friday night together, but I thought... no, I feel all right. It's not that. Mother, I'm not sick. Mother, there's a man. His name is Arthur Breslau. He's a teacher at City College. It's his birthday and um, well I sort of promised him that we'd spend the night... um, the evening together. Mother, it has nothing to do with preferring. When do I break my word to you? What do you mean when? Give me a when, when do I break my promises? Well of course I love you. Yes I do, yes I do dear. Mother... Mother I'm not being cruel. It's just... it's his birthday, that's all. I see you two or three nights a week. Mother please stop treating me like a child. I'm grown up. I'm not yelling. Because I like it here. It's only a sub-lease. They'll be back in six months. I like having it... for my own. I like being alone. I didn't mean it that way, I'm sorry. About a month. I... I meant to tell you before. Um... he's a very nice man. He's kind and gentle. You'd like him. It didn't happen that way. I met him after I rented the apartment. Mother, you should see what I'm getting him for his birthday. It's a genuine Zuni fetish doll. I found it in a curio shop on Third Avenue. Arthur teaches Anthropology. That's why I got it for him. It's a Zuni hunting fetish. It's really interesting. There's supposed to be some. Zuni hunter's spirit inside of it and um, there's a golden chain wrapped around it to keep the spirit from making the do? come to life. Come to life. It says, should this chain be removed, spirit in do? will become one living... well, that's what it says. On the scroll. The scroll. It comes with the doll inside the box. You should see his face mom. Mom? Why is it always like this? I will not get a headache. I will not get a headache. I am going to take a bath and then I'm going to meet my fellow. And we're going to have a lovely time. A lovely time. Mom. Hello, Arthur? Hi. Well, I um... you know me too well, don't you? It is our one night on the town. You know, every Friday night, well... you know, I've told you before. I just don't want to hurt her feelings. My moving out was hard enough on her. Well, I know I had every right to move out, that's not the point. I realize we planned to spend the evening together, but... Arthur... it's only one day. Couldn't we celebrate your birthday tomorrow night? I just don't want to hurt her feelings. She is my mother after all. All right. Bye. Hooray for Friday night. What did you do, fall off the table? Where'd you go? Where are you? Ow! Well, I guess I found you. At least the tip of your spear. But how you got that far back. I'm getting warm. Come out, come out wherever you are. Is that you little man? He's got to be there. What's going on? Come on Amelia. Now don't get spooky on me Amelia. Wooden dolls do not move about. That bulb probably just burnt out. Oh, God. Operator, operator, please get the police. I don't know where I'm located. Just get the police. It's an emergency. There's a, there's a... just get me the police please. This can't be happening. This is Amelia mom. I'm sorry I acted the way I did. I think we should spend the evening together just the way we planned. It's kind of late though. Why don't you come by my place and we'll go from here. No, I'm all right. Good.
