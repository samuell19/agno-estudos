Friday, 29th June... A good day Celine Crespin got the blame for me playing around in class She'll be kept in on Sunday I confessed two sins of impurity that I hadn't committed That really gave me thrill Lore and me get such pleasure when we do something wrong To sin has become our chief aim Let the other idiots live their lives doing good We shall dedicate our fives to Satan, our Lord and Master It's you I couldn't sleep Me neither You won't believe what I found What is it? - Got the torch? Listen... She was standing right next to me I raised my knee, parting her legs as though for a lover My hand on her blouse traced the shape of her naked body She yielded slowly, arching her back as her skin trembled Good? Sleep was not on their minds as they drew close The next day I went back to her and we blushed to see each other She took me to her bedroom so we could be alone We slipped together under the thin blankets Our heads nestled close and the light shone through We lay looked together, bodies cloaked in a strange radiance delighting in our nakedness Who loved and who was the lover no man would ever know What's it called? There's no cover - Who wrote it? - Doesn't say - Where'd you find it? - The attic above the music room There's a lot, but I only got this one. Teacher was there - Shall we go? - Where? To the attic? They keep it locked That's a pity. What can we do? I'll get some tools from home next week There's loads of stuff there How did it go with the Priest? Tell me all, my child We must purify your soul. Wash it of all sin That's what confession's for Should have seen his face The more I told him the redder he got He looked like a tomato So, girls, how are things? Fine And school? Not bad I'll bet. You're a pair of tearaways No, father I could almost believe you You should believe us. We're two good little girls Here we go - Regards to your parents, Lore - See you soon Try to come How are you? - I'm well - Come inside, if you have time That's good of you but we have to get back for dinner You're sure? Perhaps next time Of course Goodbye and regards to your wife And to yours. See you soon - Gustave, where is Madame? - In her studio, sir Go up and see her What is it? It's a fabric design. Do you like it? - It's really good Get changed, we're eating soon So, tell us Anne, what's happening at St Mary's? Not much, mother But there must be something to report How is the Crespin girl? We ran into her parents the other day She was kept in this weekend What did she do? Made a noise in prayers I thought she was a model pupil Exactly. She's always managed to get away with it But she's your friend It's what she deserved. Always trying to please teachers Anne, leave the poor thing alone. You're hurting it I'm off to bed - Don't read too late - I won't At your age you need sleep They were all amazed beyond measure and said: He has performed great miracles He made the deaf to hear and the dumb to speak In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen My dearest brethren... We started late today, so I'll try to be brief Following the programme I set out over the last few weeks... ...we come today to the worst of the seven deadly sins Lust... To be precise - the dreadful sins of the flesh Remember, brethren, the sixth and ninth commandments Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's wife Punishment. Damnation. Hell-fire. Corruption. Thus, my dear brethren, listen to what I say to you I warn all those children present Especially those who are about to have their first Communion For this is the age when temptation first begins Avoid all bad examples and bad friends Parents, I beseech you Don't allow your children to see such obscene papers... ...as are found now on all news stands or these glossy magazines where marriage is scorned The woman treated worse than a dog Beware of cinema and television vehicles also of depravity and degradation Cursed be he who brings shame Remember the words of our Lord It were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he cast into the sea than that he should offend any of these little ones I believe in one God, Almighty Father... Are you coming to ours? We're going to my aunt's I really like this new priest Such words from a young man, it's very reassuring At least he's not trying to be trendy. Keeping up with the youth It was good sermon Tell your parents to come for coffee at the château Please, Mr Fournier... We have family business We don't have to stay long Stop that Please, Mrs Fournier The girls really want to... Just a quick visit, then See you soon. Come along What are you doing later, Pierre? Working Checking my conference speech I wish we could spend an afternoon together I want to play cards Why not play with Anne? She doesn't know how And I don't like to see her continually indoors After all, this is her one day of freedom She's locked away all week Here they are Don't go far, Lore. We've only five minutes - Did you hear me? - Who's that? - Leon, the gardener - Why is he looking at us? - Ignore him. He's an idiot Here we are It's wonderful - Not disappointed? - It's just how I imagined It just needs tidying up and a good clean Seen the fireplace? It works too What was here before? I don't know. Just a spare room We can put the bed there, and the books over there There's something else. Come and look - For the ceremony - What is it? The château's old chapel Not been used for 25 years Pretty...? They put the coffins down here My father... I'd better go I wish we could stay here all day So do I They're over this side in three days it'll be our holiday Lore came this afternoon She saw our room and the chapel She loved it Wonderful. We'll perform the ceremony there This morning we got two more hosts We've almost a hundred now Not that one. Take an old one This one's beautiful Try another This one? It'll do fine Look It's not bad Fine for an old man It's late. We should go up now See that? What? Sister Martha and the novice. Come on Goodnight, sisters - You asked to see me, my child? You had confession two days ago We must talk. It's important This way Come, my child Forgive me, father, I have sinned May the Lord be in your heart and on your lips so you may confess all sins In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost Recite the Conflteor I confess to Almighty God, to blessed Mary ever Virgin To blessed Michael to John the Baptist to the Holy Apostles, to all saints, and you Father That I have sinned in thought, word and deed Through my fault, through my most grievous fault Therefore I beseech... Therefore I beseech Blessed Mary, ever Virgin blessed Michael, blessed John the Holy Apostles, all Saints, and you, Father to pray to the Lord our God for me I hear you, my child What is it, my child? You seem upset Don't cry, my child I've done something very bad No sin is so great that it cannot be pardoned I'm ashamed Come, come. Dry your tears - You have a handkerchief? Here, use mine Good. Now tell me... Last night... Go on Outside Sister Martha's room I looked through the keyhole And then? I saw Sister Martha... ...kissing Sister Cecile What did you say? I saw her kiss Sister Cecile on the lips Go on... And what happened then? I don't know, they locked the door And how did you feel when you'd seen this? Was it good? How do you mean? When you saw them kissing? No, Father So why did you do it? Out of curiosity What did you think after you'd seen it? Did you want to do it? No, Father. It's wicked You are right, my child. It's a great sin If it's a great sin, Father, why did they do it? One evening we must talk of all these things Life is not always simple This evening I don't have time But you were right to tell me It was very brave of you So don't worry But don't tell your friends It could do them much harm - Can I count on you? Remember Matthews words If thy eye offends thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee It is better to enter into life with one eye rather than, having two eyes, to be cast into hell fire For your penance meditate on those words And promise me you will forget what you saw - Well? Say your act of contrition O God, I am heartily sorry for having offended you You are all good and deserving of all my love and my sins offend thee I firmly resolve, with the help of Your Grace, to sin no more and to do my penance So this is the big one, is it not, girls? Forward march. Promise you'll behave To bed early and up early The Bievres asked you over while we're away - If you do go, be good Be a grown up Do as your mother said See you when we get back Go and visit your granny, she'd like that Look, it's Anne - Have your parents left? - This morning - So you'll be alone for two months? - She's not a child anymore Anyway, she's not alone. Gustave and the staff will be there And if she needs us, we're here I prefer to stay behind One year they took me along I was really bored I don't know... I'm not sure I'd be happy leaving Lore alone for two months Why - what could happen? If she needs anything, we're right here You know that don't you, Anne? I'm really grateful. ls Lore free this afternoon? But of course Can she stay for dinner too? She mustn't get back too late She has homework to do. It's exams next year, don't forget Go on, then Take a cardigan, it might get cold Don't do anything silly You really should stop treating them like children I'm not sure I'd be happy leaving Lore alone for two months She has homework to do. It's exams next year, don't forget What shall we do? Let's ride around for a bit - Hey look, it's Emile's bike - Who? The farmer's son. A real idiot Girls, what's going on? What are you up to? Emile, it's just me and my friend You shouldn't watch people pee What you doing? Watching the cows. They won't do it themselves They'd jump that electric fence What you sniggering at? My friend likes you. Can we come inside to talk? Why not Here's my best friend, Lore Hello there What's that wood for? A stick for the cows You on holiday, Miss Anne? Since yesterday Both at the same school? The priest wanted me to go to school But my parents wouldn't let me. They needed me here Pity. I would have liked it What did you want to be? Don't know. A priest perhaps Why you laughing? Being a priest is not a proper job Maybe. But I'd have liked it You wouldn't. They can't have women Ever made love, Emile? None of your business It's not proper talk for young ladies I'll show you Come back here I'll show you Damn bloody bitches Always trying to get out Guess what she told me? What? She fancies you and wants to do it with you You're fooling with me Did you say that, Lore? Yes, but it's a secret Look at her lovely legs Why are you waiting? Let me go. - Are you certain he's not here? - He'll be at the stables - He sleeps there? - No, at the château - That where he sleeps? Who's that? Him with his mother - Pretty...? - What is it? A canary. His favourite And that one? It's a bullfinch, from Java And those? They're mandarins That's a ring dove and those are budgies - Got the seeds? - We'll kill them one at a time - Why? So he suffers more If we kill them all now... ...he'll have a bad time once then get over it Alright then So let's start with this one It's lifeless It's dead Quick, it's him When did you go to bed? At 10, mother I didn't hear you come back - Hows Anne? - She's fine, mother What did you do yesterday? We went for a walk You should go to the abbey at Fontrevault It's wonderful. Isn't it Henry? What? I was saying to Lore she should visit the abbey Well, it would be educational This the best holiday I've ever had Since I met Lore I've been so happy Every day we do something wonderful together - Are your sure there's no dog? - It died Look at his stupid face Look how he nods Who's the old man? His father. See the resemblance? But he's even uglier What do they eat? No idea. Potatoes, probably Come on That's the best There you go Where was I? I'll start by saying that Maldoror was good during his early years when he lived happily He later realised he was born wicked A strange fate For many years he concealed his character as best he could but in the end, because it was not natural to him blood would rush to his head every day Until, no longer able to bear such a life he flung himself into a career of evil Transport of delight Who guessed when he hugged a rosy cheeked child he longed to tear those cheeks with a razor You read well One should let one's nails grow for a fortnight How sweet to brutally snatch from his bed a child with no hair yet on his upper lip and, 'with eyes 'wide open, pretend to suavely stroke his forehead brushing back his beautiful locks Then, at the moment when he least expects it to sink one's nails into his tender breast Careful not to kill him for if he died, there would be no later viewing of his misery Youth, forgive me... When this fleeting life is done we will be together forever One single being, my lips pressed against yours I want to stay like this the rest of my life The ceremony is tomorrow It will be the best day of our lives All is ready We got the dresses this morning and the rehearsal went well Tomorrow, writing these pages, I'll be a different woman I renounce forever Jesus Christ and all his works And dedicate myself for eternity to Satan We beseech thee, Satan, our Lord and Master Help us to be ever more wicked Help us to do evil and, at the hour of our death, take us to your Satanic bosom Stop What is it, Leon? Quick... Hurry ls Miss Lore not around? She's away for a few days Hello, postie. Anything for the château? For the château? Yes, I think I do Wait a second... Look, there's one for you My darling... It's ten days now since we've been parted And I'm as unhappy as can be All day driving in the car, it's torture for me We return next week. I'm lost without you She won't still be there Really? He'll have told the Mother Superior If not, we can always blackmail her "I'll tell the Mother Superior what you and Cecile did" There's a man down there Is there a problem? I've run out of petrol Know where I could get some? The next village is at least 5 miles There's no cars about. Not one for over an hour Any farms nearby? They'll be asleep and they wouldn't answer No chance This is insane, what can I do? Sleep in the car until tomorrow Or come to the château We've lots of room. It's up to you I don't want to be any trouble It's no trouble at all There's only us there I never normally come this way Lock the car and come with us - You're sure you don't mind? - No, I told you Get on the back, it's a mile or so I really am grateful Wait for me. This is our place Very nice - Did you do all this? Sit down. I'll light the fire Really very nice You live round here? No, not at all Just passing through Whisky? Excuse me? She offered you a whisky I'm sorry... Yes, thank you Did you do this? May I? Muriel put the doll down on the table and picked up the little axe With one precise stroke she chopped off the dolly's head Taking the body, she placed it under the glass dome in the dining room She put both her hands on the glass and said: Vile and detestable creature may the rats tear you piece by piece so that you die like the meanest of flies Then she took the axe once more and did the same to all her little sister's dolls Not very jolly It's not supposed to be It's for our school play - We think it'll do the job - Indeed Not having one? No, we hate it You can take off your jacket and shoes Do you love your wife? - Of course - Doesn't look like it Why did you ask? For information We're researching marriage What's she like, pretty? Not bad How old? Thirty-five ls she house proud? Are you unfaithful? That's personal - So what should we talk about? - The weather? Do you have children? A boy and a girl You love them? Of course I do Why "of course"? Lots of parents don't love their children Ours, for example Are you an experienced lover? Why? Well...you don't look like one Do you know what you're saying? Do our questions annoy you then? Would you rather see our legs? Which is the prettiest? Damn, the fire's going out - Where you going? - To get more wood Are you rich? Bastard. - Are you alright? - I'm fine He's not breathing I've killed him Didn't know I hit him so hard It's his fault. He shouldn't have grabbed me What can we do? Get rid of him How? Throw him in the lake Really? What about the car? The body's more important Hope no-one heard us I'll go and see if there's a light What is it? Miss Anne, come and see Someone broke into your place last night I'm coming I saw the door open earlier. Were you here last night? Look at all this. It's shocking Who could have done it? We didn't hear a thing Think of all the work you did. Your parents won't be pleased It's best not tell them Why? They'd only worry As you wish They called to say they'll be back today Shall I tell the police? No, don't tell anyone. Keep it to ourselves Very well But it's really shocking Anne... I've just seen the newsletter from St Mary's What's all this about the rebuilding? What are they up to? Anne, I'm speaking to you What's up with you? You've been in a mood since we got back No I'm not I've had a note from the school Asking for money again They're good at that I can't take it We not seen Lore for two days, we've got to be careful Anything could betray us Back to school tomorrow We should be safe there Two days since we got back and we're doing fine After the first few mad hours we calmed down A policeman is coming to ask questions But we'll show him Come with me - It's mad coming here - I'm afraid Why? How did it go? Badly. He asked lots of questions What did he ask? How long we've known each other, what we did in the vacation How often we met. Had we seen the car on the road Anything else suspicious You must go. If they see us it'll look bad They won't find the body - Really? - Of course Come with me Do you smoke? I guess your friends told you why I'm here I just want to ask you a few questions Well? - They suspect us - I said so Emile told them about the cows And that he'd seen us set fire to the haystacks They found bike tracks by the car We're going to prison. They're going to lock us up - Not without the body - They'll find it, I know they will They might We could tell them it was an accident They'll never believe that - They'll split us up - Calm down I don't want to leave you, I can't - They won't split us up - You promise? - Do you trust me? - You're shivering - I'm cold Hold me tight When we exchanged blood, we became joined forever You regret that? Still cold? That's better You're crying - Why? - I love you Me too. Remember... When this fleeting life is done, we will be together forever One single being, my lips pressed against yours You mean it? - I'll sort this all out - Please don't leave me We should go back. They'll be watching us I'm afraid I didn't want to scare Lore, but it's almost over They'll discover the body in a few days But they'll never separate us We shall be together forever And now the Dolls' Ballet performed by year Eight - Such lovely costumes - Like little angels Your little one has really grown Yes, she's simply shot up When the young man came back home He took his head in both hands Full of science - Brain - Rich brain - Do you hear the madness flow? - Asking for a barrier Dig a ditch, dig it deep - Asking for a barrier - Dig a ditch, dig it deep When the home man came back home - He heard sad scales sound - Piano crying in the night - Scales - Old scales We search and search again Her husband locked me out - Dig a ditch, dig it deep - Her husband locked me out Dig a ditch, dig it deep When the young man came back home - He stuck his nose into his soul - Where all his troubles ferment Soul, sweet soul, their oil's too old for your flame Night's everywhere outside - Dig a ditch, dig it deep - Night's everywhere outside Then this young man with problems loaded Found a sharp knife, a gift in its sheath Blade take aim Be sharper than any dame And you, O God, forgive me now Dig a ditch, dig it deep - And you O God, forgive me now - Dig a ditch, dig it deep When the gravedigger reached his home - He saw it was a sweet soul - The sort that nowadays is rare Soul Sleep sweetly my soul It's better when you're dead Dig a ditch, dig it deep - It's better when you're dead - Dig a ditch, dig it deep We will have beds filled with light scents Sofas as deep as tombs And strange flowers on shelves Blooming for us beneath more beautiful skies Are they mad? What are they up to? It's not what they rehearsed - We should warn the Mother Superior - This is awful - We've got to stop them We will exchange a single flash of lightning Like a long sob, charged full with farewells And later an Angel, opening the doors Will come to revive, faithful and joyous The tarnished mirrors and the dead flames O Death, old Captain, it is time. Weigh anchor Let's sail beyond the doldrums of our days Though black as pitch the sea and sky you know our hearts are full of light Pour us poison to revive our souls It cheers the burning quest that we pursue Who cares for Hell or Heaven In the depths of the unknown we seek out the New Stop They've gone mad. They're burning.
