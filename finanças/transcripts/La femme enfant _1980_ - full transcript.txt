Come in, Elisabeth. two 00:02:04,247 --> 00:02:05,632 Stop it. Stop it. Quiet children, silence, stop it. Come next sunday. I think Hélène will still be sick. Stop. Thanks. Help me. Elisabeth, come help me. Wednesday is the day of your music class? Yes. I'll write a letter for your teacher. Madame Dubroc will come to tidy up your hair at 5:30 in the afternoon. I can't do this alone. I promised you would be here. She said her son told her that you're a true artist. This egg doesn't look good. What? I said this egg isn't very fresh. Show me. It smells like an egg. Henry. What is it? This egg seems to smell really bad. I'll eat it. No, we're making an omelette. What's wrong with her? She cries all the time. I know what it is, you're going through puberty. Give it to me. I'll give it to the cat. She just had kittens. Don't be so angry, I'll hurry, I'm hurrying. Yes, I see the mischievious slacker. Oh no no. Don't cook me. No, no, no, no... No, no, no No, no... It's not the frog. It's not the frog. No, not the frog. I never said no. Marguerite. Marguerite. Not this one. No need, don't touch. Oh yes! Come now, hurry. Left. Go left. Come this way. Right here. So it's out of the way. That wasn't easy, let's rest, thank you. Well, the skirt, you found it. You can clearly see, I don't cry anymore now. How old are you? 30 at least? Stretch like a watch! It's the brioche there! Mind if I take a piece? Well, I think you would have looked at me if you saw me passing on the street? When I was 4! Is it true? Mom said... Look, your sister. Mom said, come back now. What the hell! Would you like to try? Yes, I would like to try. I'm going to do this very subtly. Open your eye. Open your eye. Not a lot. Damn it. No, it's for your eye. Marcel. What am I seeing! You take care of a crow! Duck? Warbler? Starling? Wild goose? Mallard. Am I close? Sorry, it was a Magpie! Another duck? Barnacle Goose? Mallard? Wild goose again? But you said yes not long ago. You're demanding. Flew. Oh, it's a dog! What's the problem? Answer, answer. Come on, someone's here. It's you, it's just you. So Marcel, we were quite scared. And I called very loudly. I waited for an answer. This thing could have lasted a long time. I was thinking about what was out there. A gangster or something! Hey, you know Marcel, it's safe here. You don't have to hide like that. Next time you'll have a problem. I was about to use my weapon. Well then, no harm done, goodbye. Listen, listen to me please. During the exam, you will be judged on this difficult passage. Stop playing fast like you want to prove you're a genius. Start again, please. Slowly. François, you know that one, do you want to play? Today are we going to take off the crow's bandage? You never tell me anything. I can get in? I can? And now, now can I get in? It's not too cold, not too hot. All the right notes. We get along. As they are rich, the people of the castle. I too will become a rich woman. I swear. I love you too Marcel. Well, you told me. It's Corvo's day of freedom. Now can I set him free? Is anyone absent today? You smell good, what's that? It's my secret. It's not hard to find your secret. It's in your mother's store I'll get it whenever I want. Hazebrouck! Here I am, madam. Do you have something to tell us this morning, Hazbrouck? Can you tell us about it? Good. You had to study for today, if I'm not mistaken, Die Loreleï, Heinrich Heine. Who can summarize for me the meaning of this poem? Loreleï is a very beautiful young woman. She swims and sings, too. She has a golden comb. She is combing her golden hair. Bricheux. Men are bewitched by her and often lose sight of the water. Yes, and what happens then? They drowned and die. Yes, they all die. This wonderful lady will cause your death. She leads them to perdition. Heinrich Heine. He himself was under the influence of a young woman who caused him suffering. Who wants to recite the poem? I see you prefer me to choose someone myself. Emerick, come to the board. Heinrich Heine... 56. I know not if there is a reason Why I am so sad at heart. A legend of bygone ages, Haunts me and will not depart. The air is cool under nightfall. The calm Rhine courses its way. The peak of the mountain is sparkling With evening's final ray. The fairest of maidens is sitting So marvelous up there, Her golden jewels are shining, She's combing her golden hair. She combs with a comb also golden, And sings a song as well Whose melody binds a wondrous, And overpowering spell. In his little boat, the boatman Is seized with a savage woe, He'd rather look up at the mountain Than down at the rocks below. I think that the waves will devour The boatman and boat as one; And this by her song's sheer power Fair Lorelei has done. Well, see, you know. I believe I'm speechless. You expressed it very well. And with a lot of feeling. I think your classmates agree with me. I'm very satisfied Elisabeth because because you've never shown us this much emotion. It's a revelation. You're up to 19 now. Congratulations. Well Elisabeth, you may take your seat. What's wrong, Elisabeth? You did really well. You can go back to your seat. Now, let's continue this text analysis. You must have read the questions at the bottom of the page. For example, if I do like this with my hair or leave it wet or if I comb it you like it, don't you? You have to be careful. Don't get caught. Some have died before because of a woman's hair. But me, my hair? It's always like this when you are not here. Why don't you have any good friends? Why don't you have any good friends? No diary! No radio! Nobody! It's over now, you're doing mommy games ... It's very practical to play quiet! In this climate, people don't want an exorbitant hairstyle. Well, all the time. At Mauricette we feel great. Sit correctly. I'm going to ask you to color my hair. Élisabeth are you studying? Are the kids OK? All right, ma'am. Louise, is the youngest growing up? Yes. But, it's Elisabeth. What was there? Are you hurt? No, no. Is nothing. I wanted to avoid an animal on the street. What are you doing out so early? I'm going to school. But you do realize what time it is? It's five minutes to six! You're an hour early, my poor child. You can sleep for one more hour, lucky girl. Come in, I'll take you home. It will save you some time. No, no, it's okay. You'll be late! At your age, ten minutes of sleep, seems like an hour. We will. In between. What's the problem? I misunderstood the time. Did you see the car? I found Mr. Kraus, he told me the time. You can ask him. Yup. Elisabeth have you seen her? Oh! Turn off the light. Oh yeah. Want me! Want me! Want me! Want me! Want me! Want me! Want me! Want me! Want me! Do you understand what she is saying? Want me! No, you? Want me! Leave her be, she's just having trouble waking up. At your age, sleeping with rats! Where did you find that garbage? Oh, a man! It's that strange man who lives alone. Only lunatics wear shoes with crepe soles. Have you noticed his bicycle? Go ahead. I know him, he's Marcel the mute. He's from Belloy. He's Mr. La Riviere's gardener. That's him? Are you sure? He left... Was he really born mute? Not just mute, but retarded as well! You say that because you don't know anything. My grandfather is a friend of Mr. de la Riviere. And he says, on the contrary, he's very smart. Very clever. If he doesn't speak it's because he - doesn't want to. - Ah, there he is again. His mother gave birth to him during the war at age 17. She managed to save herself, but eventually they got her. They say she had her hair shaved off. It was only after he was taken from his mother that he became a mute. And now, if someone loved him, do you think he would start talking again? My father told me that if we speak at the right age, we learn. After that, never again! She knows what she's saying, her father is a doctor. You know perfectly well that you shouldn't have come. Not to school, not anywhere, not ever. You're not my father or my my mother or anything at all. And if I get sick, as you say, you wouldn't have to take care of me. All you would have to do is wait until I was better. If I don't want to come visit I have the right. I'm grown up now. I come visit because I feel sorry for you. You always make me feel sorry for you. And you scare me sometimes. I keep worrying that I'm making you so sad. I can't work properly in the classroom. I always have to obey everyone! You, my parents, Anne, the priest. Pretty soon I'll be fourteen. Since I was three and half I've done what I was told. Three and a half years old. Now I disobey everyone because of you. And I know I make you believe that everything is good, everything is okay, but it's not good, it's not okay. Marcel... Marcel. Marcel. Do you have any idea what time it is? I was at church. That's not true. I sent your father to fetch you half an hour ago, and the church was closed. So now my daughter you tell me where you were at eight o'clock at night. Because your story about being at church doesn't work. Not here, at the Quaix Church. You know very well that the exam is next week. I told you but you never listen to me. Pay attention Elisabeth. I'll know if you're lying to me. I can call your teacher and find out. So you were at the Quaix church? Yes mom, I was there. Very good. That's fine. Wash your hands and set the table. What were you doing at that farm? What were you doing at that farm? Good luck. I got it, I got it. I did it. I finished, I did it, I did it, I passed the exam. Would you really still love me if I didn't play music? I passed the exam. What's wrong? Come on, here turkeys! What turkeys? Here, all pressed against each other. One turkey, two turkeys, three turkeys. Look at this one, ma'am. Which one will he eat? Oh, my dear, don't worry. It's when it's raining that the turkeys must be taken care of. Wet, their heads get all wet. Oh, ma'am, you're right. They don't even have hats. They always have their heads uncovered. And they're not even in control of their own bodies. They wander back and forth, it really is a true tragedy. What do you want, ma'am? Me? A turkey saunters out, to draw your attention to its fine features. I can't ignore that one, it's so powerful-looking! I agree, ma'am. But two more turkeys, three turkeys plus 10 turkeys, will always be turkeys. But we're all turkeys, ma'am. Oh no, we are different. We are women. We incubate, lay eggs. We have a lot to brag about when we feel like it. Turkeys, they, what do they do anyway? They don't do anything. Anything. They parade around. Marcel. I don't know what to say. And I was saying, lady, that... Turkey bothered me, and... Okay bye! Hi! Hi! Hi! You take the studio... - Greetings, ma'am. - Greetings, Mr. Director. Hi Elisabeth. - Go ahead, please. - Thanks. Thank you for coming at my request. Your daughter is very talented. Please sit down. I heard, my dear, my dear Élisabeth. I'm so happy for you. And you know how sad I am to lose you. But, You're leaving us to come back with the laurels of fame and maybe even as a celebrity, someday. Why the Lille Conservatory will take you directly to Paris. Do you have a place to stay? Madame Dubroc, that older lady that you know in Lille, they're my cousins and they even have a little daughter. Very good, very good. Reverend. Yes? We'll be in touch. I came early because my mom didn't want to let me go to school today, because I had a fever yesterday. Last night. I was afraid you would worry. Am I bothering you? What did you hide just now? Yes, yes, I heard something. There. No need, no need, I saw you. What is it? It's for me? Oh, sorry. Mom told me that I can't have birthdays anymore since I'm 14. Is it time to leave? It's nothing. The cold does that. If I don't come tomorrow, or even the next day, it's because my fever is back. Don't worry. Elisabeth. Elisabeth. Get dressed now, it's time. We will. We will. Understand this, Elisabeth, if Mrs. Dubroc recommended you to these people, it's because she knows us well. She assumes you've been raised correctly. And that you will not disturb them. You need to understand this because they're paying you well, not just to play with their daughter, but to behave and set an example. So don't act like you do here. Watch how they live. Help them in the kitchen. Be mindful. But mom, I know, you already told me. Once again, Élisabeth. You will be staying with important people. Do you realize the opportunity you have here? These people, if they like you, they might even take you with them on vacation. They have houses. You need to see them, sitting by the sea. With rugs and fine things. The servants, you must be polite to them. Because if you have problems, they're the ones you need to talk to. Not the others with you. You understand, she has other things to take care of besides yourself. You will live there and learn from shadowing them. These people don't eat like we do here at home. You should never clean your plate with bread. All that is over now. Also, wipe your lips before you speak. However, you don't have to speak. That's it, Élisabeth, try to be quiet. Are you listening to me? And, if someone looks at you, you should smile. There he is! Henry. Dad, I'm ready. - Hey, let's go. - He's doing well. In the communion of saints. In the remission of sins. In the resurrection of the flesh. For eternal life. Amen. Amen. Hey Henry, it's Mr. Marcel. He's been walking in circles. Let him decide. Let him make the decision himself. Sir... Here, have a seat. I'll take your jacket. You'll be more comfortable. It will get in the way. Take it off. I'll keep it safe for you over here, don't worry. The gentleman is mute. I'll put it here. I'll be with you right away. Your hair has grown since the last time. You think? I lose less hair now. Oh yes, much better now. This cream I applied is very good. Let's apply a little more, for extra effect. Looks good? Yes thanks. Done. Well, shampoo and a haircut, 1 franc and 50. Thanks. Goodbye, sir. Sir, madam... Sir... He's very kind, this gentleman. Ah, but that's exactly what I say every day. I say, hairdressers, there's no better way to understand human nature. To get back to what we were saying... There are some women, you know, ma'am, a little water on the head and a few touches on the neck, and they tell your intimate life from A to Z. It's amazing what you can hear. Sometimes I feel ashamed for my husband. Oh, don't worry, Mr. Marcel. It's just the cat. Here, don't move. Looks like the poor guy really tries his best. And for her, you know, it's just not enough. She's always ready to try again. At least that's what she told me, which is terrible for her! She wiggles her fingers like this. I understand... In the end, she's frustrated with him. That's it, she blames him. Sometimes she feels sorry for him. Sometimes she doesn't forgive him. It's all physical. He's deeply aware of it. So what do you expect? A man has limits. The side whiskers? Well, during the day, when she thinks to admit it. Trim a little? And during the night... Square or hollow. I won't cut too much of your hair, okay? All right, Mr. Marcel. And your daughter, how is she doing? You have news? - Do not move. - Very good. Turn your head. In fact, she called us this morning. She's very happy. Don't move. It's a world where there's money. Some very interesting people, too. She plays music all day. You spoil her. Oh, but that's not true, she earns her living. We don't have enough. Don't move. We're told that she'll succeed. Her father and I, we we would like to believe that. We wish her all the best. Why... Oh yeah. Please. Because in this profession not all parents would allow it. Now! At 14 years old? Oh, it's because she didn't ask us. And everyone came to talk about her. The priest, Madame Dubroc, the conservatory. We want to know how she wrapped all these people around her finger. And we're trying to figure it out. Because back here in the shop, we could really use her help for next year. Couldn't you put your foot down? Oh, but we're not going to force her to stay here of she doesn't want to. And because we're happy, and so busy, we don't have time to think about it. We work, we're always busy. You can see that. But she was bored. She would cry whether we told her yes or no. Stand firm, please. She didn't have good manners. Always silent. She didn't eat enough, it's very simple. It felt like we put her through hell! It's true, She's very smart for her age. But left alone, where she is now, - she will succeed and grow. - Yes yes. I tossled your hair a little. But, stop it. Stop, you're crazy. Sir! Henry. Don't worry too much, he's headed back home... Marcel looked really shook up! Don't worry so much. He'll be okay. Don't worry, and don't cry. Don't be scared. Henry, are you okay? Yes I am well. We'll leave you, Emerick. Oh, now what am I doing? Today I don't know what I'm doing. But Henry, I'm serving you! Nature calls. Elisabeth's music when she grows up. Credit Du Nord Dunkirk Signed in 1975. To the music of Élisabeth, 1976. For January 250 francs . 200 francs ... 1978, 2400 Francs April. Bunny shopping. 1979, 2000. Here you are, Elisabeth is back! Hello Mr... There was blood everywhere. Anyway, it's a fact, that's how it is. His father took him to the cemetery alone. We shouldn't speak of it. Henry. Well, you must have more to tell us. How is it over there? It's good? Oh mother, not now. Tonight... I would love to go for a little walk. Yes, yes, of course, my little girl. It's very sweet of you to make this trip and to think of us and visit. Don't worry about the dishes. We'll do that later. Well, go now. Go get some fresh air. Well, tell me anyway. Did everything go well with Mrs. Dubroc? You didn't bother her? No, no, she was very kind. Very good. Stop lying. Right here, finally the proof. - Here it is. - Stop it.. It is four years out of date, And also, for kisses it's too late.
