There must be some kind of clue So we can get out of here Hey Could you get any clues? All cubic rooms together Assemble to form a larger cube Just like this room There should be a more detailed point There is, right? Being a series of numbers that could Be 27 and 25 at the same time Or maybe they just could Be one of two numbers 25 or 27 Maybe the way out was written there? I'm sorry, but I do not know anything about this So none of this nonsense It's not useful, is it? But if so, at least We know the number of rooms is not infinite There must be a way out ... exist from here At the moment we have no choice but to Let's continue like this, am I not right? ... That too by looking at numbers What the hell is this? So what does this mean now? ...We returned We're back here This body was in the first room we came from You mean, like, back home?

It's so unusual that I went back to the first room Because we have to be somewhat of a Follow certain terms and conditions Rules: If they pass through a window, then They can not go back through the same window, so only five They have the right to choose, in which case it is not possible They can return to their original place He's right We just went to higher rooms Which in this case to get here We mostly moved to the lower rooms You mean, like, we didn't come back here? ... We did not return ... These are the rooms that move ... or something like that No ... maybe this is us We were not back here If we continue .... if we continue like this Come on, then we can go Enough What else do you want to do? Do you think we should go? Let's go We all get out of here ...I'm sure OK? You must have a reason to be in such a hurry Am I not right Mr. Idea? Maybe you have someone outside who is waiting for you? For example, your spouse? Now maybe never I can not have a wife It's all my fault But I will definitely get out of here Even if I'm the last person to go out all right Pull it up You have a lot of problems too, right?
