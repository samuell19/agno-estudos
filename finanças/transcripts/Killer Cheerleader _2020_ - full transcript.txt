(dramatic music) (car whooshes past) (muffled shouting) (muffled pleas) (muffled pleas continue) (muffled pleas grow frantic) (door slams) (dramatic music crescendos) (peaceful music plays) (girl sniffles) - darcy, honey, talk to me. - About what? Mom wouldn't listen to me, she refused to get help. I just, I couldn't save her. - She was my sister, and I couldn't save her either. Your mom had a lot of demons. They just got the best of her. But now it's time to focus on your future, right? New home, new school, things will get better. - I don't know what better is. Mom and I were constantly on the move, and I was always the new kid in school. I'm not good at making friends. - With that sweet smile? Your uncle and I, we tried so hard to have kids. Then he died, and I kinda lost my way. And now that your mom's gone, it's just you and me. I've never been a parent, but I will do my best to make sure that you have a good life, okay? - Thank you, aunt cassie. I haven't been here since I was a kid when mom had to go somewhere to dry out. I really wanted to live here. - Well, now it's yours. Welcome home. (upbeat drum music) - five, six, seven, eight. ♪ Amazons will cheer you on ♪ ♪ we got your back, now go attack ♪ - [coach] great, girls, but keep smiling. - Tracy, out instead of up. - That's right, tracy, just watch taylor, okay? All right, let's do it again. - One more time girls. Fix, six, seven eight. One, two, three, and four. Five, six, seven, eight. Good, five, six, seven. - Excuse me, I think you left this in the library. I was sitting nearby. - Thank yo so much. I can't believe I forgot it. Wait, how did you find me? - Oh, well you're the new girl, right? I mean, I just kind of asked around and somebody said they thought they saw you over here, so. - One more time girls, five, six, seven, eight. One and two, three and four. Five, pop, seven, eight. Good. - Why do you keep messing that up? It's out, not up. - I know. (whistle blowing) - top down and out. - Hey, excuse me. - I know. - Then why do you keep messing up? - Excuse me, what is going on? - She's holding the rest of us back. - I am not. - Ladies, come on, we don't argue here. - Tracy, I hate to say it, but you've been a little off lately. - That's because she's constantly judging me. - No one's judging you, tracy. - She is. - Hey! What is the amazon motto? - [cheerleaders] teamwork takes us to the top. - The keyword being teamwork. So no more problems from you two, got it? - Got it. - Got it. - All right, guys that's enough for today. - [cheerleaders] thanks, coach. - Tracy, it wouldn't hurt you to put in a little extra practice at home, okay? - Okay. - See you tomorrow. Remember, teamwork. - Anyways, my name is warren, so... (tracy shouting) - I think I broke my leg. You tripped me. - I didn't, I swear. - Go get the nurse. (tracy shouting) you all right? Oh my god, okay. Just stay still, okay? - Darcy, dinner's ready. Darcy. Darcy, you know, you've been here for almost a week, and you're still not completely unpacked. - I know, I'm sorry. I just, I can't shake that feeling that I'm gonna have to move again in a month. That's how it was with mom. - You don't have to worry about that anymore. This is your home now. And I am here to support you in everything you want to do. I promise. Okay, what's that look? - It's dumb, you'll laugh. - I absolutely will not. - I want to try out for the amazons. - Oh, the cheerleading team? That's not dumb, that's wonderful. When? - Tryouts are tomorrow, and they need a replacement like right away. It's something I've always wanted to do. You know what, forget it. - No, you have to do it. Plus, I always remember you were really athletic. You're gonna do great. - Let's be real, I'm not like those girls. I totally don't fit in and I... - you're perfect just the way you are. You're gonna make that team, I can feel it. But in order for me to give you my full support, you're gonna have to do something for me. - Okay, I knew it, what? - Come downstairs and eat the delicious dinner I spent all afternoon preparing just for you. - Deal. - Come on. (students chattering) (upbeat music) - hey, bro. - So brandon, where are you taking me tonight for our anniversary? - Hey, brandon. - Hey. - Hey over here. So again, where are you taking me tonight for our anniversary? Uh uh uh, answer the question first. - It's a private club which you can't get in unless you're super hot, and you are so. - Obviously, so where is this private club? - It's in my room. - And what should I wear? - As little as possible. - Sorry, we gotta go, tryouts are about to start. - Right, I am totally lost without April. - Did you do something to your hair? I mean, it looks even better than usual. - What can I say, it's just naturally perfect. - Oh, sorry. - Chill, you didn't break anything. - Here you go. - [brandon] I'm good. - Just heading to the gym. - Oh, you're going in for the tryouts? Nervous? - No, not at all. - I'm brandon, by the way. - I'm darcy. - Darcy, that's a name you don't hear often. Nice. Go kill it. - Did you see her? She was hitting on brandon, she is dead. - Let it go. - You're right, you're always right. I'll let it go for now. - Thanks for coming by. Bye. All right, everybody up. Now as you know, we have one position to fill immediately. Now we'll teach you a few different combinations, and then you'll do some freestyle moves to show us what you've got. Madison here will guide you through the routines. Let's hit it. - Okay, everybody over here. I'm gonna teach fast, so try to keep up. We're looking for sharpness and smile, so make sure you bring it. We're gonna jump out one, slice two. Down three, up four. (electronic music) let's do that one more time. Five, six, seven, eight. Jump one, slice two, down three, up four. All right. - If tracy trench hadn't fallen down those bleachers, we wouldn't be wasting our time here today. - But like you said, she was never that good. - True, but she was great at face-plants. (both laughing) - excellent work, girls. We'll tally up the results right now, and one of you will join the ranks of the few and the proud, the amazons. (girls applauding) now you can go wait in the lobby. Well, no question who the new member is. Darcy daniels crushed the tryout. She'll be a great addition to our team. Okay, I thought you'd all feel the same way. Well, I'll go make the announcement. - I'll meet you in the hall, okay? - Okay. - Crushed it? She didn't come close. Not pretty, worse outfit I've ever seen, not to mention performs like a trained seal. So no, she's not the newest member. - Taylor, you may be cheer caption, but it's ultimately my decision, not yours. Darcy is a million times better than tracy trench ever was and you know it. I'm gonna go tell darcy the good news right now. - You do that, coach, and I'll make sure to tell the school board you've been sleeping with principal harris, who, oops, is married. You should really be more careful. I have eyes all over this town. - You aren't going to tell me what to do. - You're right, I'm gonna tell the school board what to do. - Janice, everything okay? - Yeah, let's go. All right, ladies, let's gather round. Well, it was a tough decision, but the newest amazon is... - Oh, sorry, I was just sending a message to some super important people. Should I wait? - The newest amazon is holly paulson. - Really? (girls applauding) - the rest of you just keep practicing. Look, you're really good. Come back and try out again next semester. - Hey, guys, is there something I can do better next time? I'd really love to be an amazon. - You will never be an amazon. And next time I see you talking to my boyfriend, I'll get your ass kicked out of school. - What? - It won't be difficult if she wears clothes like those. They're so... - thrift shop. - I was gonna say dumpster. - There's nothing wrong with my clothes. And I don't know who your boyfriend is, but I already feel sorry for him. - I saw you knock those books out of his hands on purpose. - Him? We talked for like five seconds. Sorry, I didn't see your leash around his neck. - Just stay away from him. - Wow, I thought you guys were special. I was wrong. - That's all you'll ever be, wrong. - Oh, hell no. - Get off of her! - Let her go! - What are you doing? - [girl] taylor, stop. (crowd shouting) - [darcy] ow, my hair, my hair! Ow, ow! - [girl] get her, taylor! - [darcy] stop it! - [brandon] get off of her. - Get off me! - Calm down. - Hey, hey, what is going on here? - She started it. - This behavior is unacceptable. Now apologize to each other. - I apologize, even though you insulted me and shoved me first. - I apologize. - Didn't you just start here? This is not the way to make a good impression, young lady. - That's exactly what I was thinking. - And you, taylor, your conduct is unbecoming of an amazon. After school detention, both of you. Now get it together. - Okay, let's go. Back to class. - Back to class, ladies. Come on. - Move it along. - This war has just begun. - I can't believe it. - I heard everything you said to her. She and I were talking, that's all. You don't own me. - Listen, brandon, that's not how I meant it. - Yes, you did. You get jealous way too easy about everything. But you know what? How about this, we're done. - No, no, no, what about tonight? - Yeah, what about tonight? - Come on, you're gonna cry this out, and I'm gonna be right by your side, okay? - Um, sorry for interrupting. Hi, you gave a great audition. - Coach didn't seem to think so. - You're new here, right? Look, before next tryouts, I would try and get on taylor's good side. - Her good side? Does she even have one? - She's my best friend. She's always been there for me. Yes, she can be jealous and have a temper, but she definitely has a good side. You just haven't seen it yet. - Well, maybe I'll get to see it later in detention. - You've been pretty quiet all evening. - I don't like to talk while I eat. - Huh, is that what you're doing? Principal harris called me today. Told me you got into a fight with a girl at school. - I've been in a bunch of fights before, so? - Well, most girls from around here would never get into a fight. - Yeah, well I'm not from around here. - You are now. - Okay, you want to know what's wrong? I slayed the tryouts. The coach loved me, but some head cheerleader accused me of hitting on her boyfriend, which of course I didn't. And then she shoved me. I'm the wrong person to shove. - What's this girl's name? - What difference does it make? She was asking for it. - Darcy, you just started at locklear. Getting into a fight could get you kicked out. - She stopped me from getting on the team. You know what, I'm not hungry. - Darcy, please, please. I think we're starting off on the wrong foot. (upbeat music) (students chattering) - hey. - I don't think you should be talking to me. - Why not? She's not my girlfriend anymore. - She thinks she is. - Well, she's not. Anyways, we should chat later someplace more private. - May I join you? - I think you already have. (students shouting) - where is the principal? - Great, there goes me being elected homecoming queen. Everything was fine before that slut showed up. - Girl moves fast, you gotta give her that. What, she might dress trashy, but she's got prizefighter moves. - Madison. - I'll be the judge of that. - Taylor, don't. You're better than her. - I just want her to know that. - Uh, I think you should... - someone said there was a huge cockroach over here. (cheerleaders laughing) thought I'd get rid of it. (cheerleaders gasping) - the problem is they keep coming back. (students laughing) let's get out of here. - Yeah, let's go. - Oh my god, are you okay? - I'm gonna try. - Definitely should, good luck. - Hey, you might consider apologizing to taylor. It could make a big difference for you. - So you're saying if I kiss her ass like you did, I might be able to make the team? I don't think so. - You know, I'd watch my back if I were you. - Watch my back all you want. - Did you hear that? - Mhm. - See you later. - Bye. - Bye guys. - Bye. - I'll see you tomorrow. (ominous music) (madison screaming) (bone crunching) [aylor] are you seeing this? - [April] yeah. - So she was arrested for arson twice. - Among other things. - She was a hardcore prankster at her old school, and her mom was some loser alkie who oded on skid row. - And now she lives with her rich aunt. I'm sure that's the only reason she got into locklear. - The only reason. And now she wants everything that I have, including brandon. Next thing you know, she'll kick me off the amazons and go out for homecoming queen. We have to got to stop her. - Okay, but first you need to calm down. - Okay, then give me some of your meds. Your meds, they help with your condition. They help calm you down, right? - Yes, and you know I would do anything for you, but they're prescription drugs. I can't just give them to you. - Okay, just stop, nevermind. I just need to do something. I need her to feel the same pain that I do. Come on, help me think. - Well, there's always cyber stalking. - April, really, cyber stalking? That is so pedestrian. I was thinking more like an accident or two. - You're joking, right? Brandon will come back to you. - No, he won't, he'll never come back. - Don't worry, I'm here. You'll be okay, I'll make sure of it. (ominous music) - excuse me, hello? The locker room's closed. Hey, look, I don't want any problems, but you gotta leave. Please? Man, I'm gonna get fired on my first day for sneaking a peak at naked girls. Oh my god. (girl crying) - have you heard that one of the amazons was found dead in the girls locker room last night? - What? Who, what happened? - I think her name was madison. Anyways, someone said that she slipped in the shower and hit her head. - I'll talk to you later. - Okay, how about... - Hey, I just heard about madison, I'm so sorry. - Look, I would really appreciate it if you just didn't talk to me right now. (ominous music) (taylor screaming) oh my god, oh my god! (students chattering) you did this. (students laughing) - can either of you explain this morning's incident? - She wanted to get back at me for not being the new amazon. - Principal harris, I swear I don't know what happened earlier, but I had nothing to do with it. - Liar. This is just another one of the sick pranks she's pulled at every school she's ever gone to. Look her up, it's all online. - I've done some things I'm not proud of, but putting a paint balloon in your stupid lock isn't one of them. - And she started that fight to make brandon break up with me. - I did not. I have a boyfriend. - With that face? - Enough, madison benson was found dead last night in the girls' showers, are you both aware of that? The two of you ought to be offering prayers to the family, not acting like six-year-olds. Now the next time you have a problem with each other, you come to me first or I will call your parents. - She doesn't have any parents. - I forgot. Darcy, I'm sorry, I... Darcy. Taylor, you really disappoint me. Darcy lost her mom under the worst of circumstances. You should have some sympathy for her. - She stole my boyfriend. I don't have any sympathy for her, but I do have some for your wife. I bet she's been super lonely since you met coach phillips. (bell ringing) oops, time for class. - Hey, coach, I'm so sorry about madison. I don't even know what to say. - It's a terrible tragedy and a great loss for the amazons. Madison was just one of our best. - If there's anything I can do. - I want you on the team. - But the other day you said... - that was the other day. Everything has changed obviously. Now I will make the announcement, not you, got it? - I appreciate it. Thank you so much, I promise I'll... - don't thank me, just make me proud. (bell ringing) (ominous music) - wow, prize-winning performance for principal harris earlier. I know you put those balloons in my locker, and I will make you pa... - I cleaned this off the best I could. I found it by your locker. - Thanks, warren. - Let's go. (taylor screaming) oh my god, oh my god. You did this. - Honey, I am so sorry to hear about that girl that died at your school. - I mean, slipping in a shower? That's something that happens to old people. - Well, I mean, truthfully it could happen to anyone. But to die so young, it's just tragic. Hey, if you need to talk about it, I'm here for you, remember? Is this blood? - I can explain. - Did you get in another fight? - No, I swear it wasn't... - don't lie to me. - I'm not. - Then what happened? - This. (taylor screaming) - oh my god, oh my god. - This is disgusting. Does principal harris know about this? - Of course he does. Someone put a paint balloon in taylor's locker and she went totally cray and thought I did it, which I didn't. - Taylor. - The one who shoved me. - Taylor jennings? - I don't know, why? - Well, if it's her, her parents are the co-directors of the school board. And they're very active in local politics. I actually sold them their last two homes. They're kind of important people. - What does that have to do with me? Oh, I get it, they're influential, and you don't want my behavior to reflect badly on you. It might change your social status. - I didn't say that. - You'd didn't have to, but I know that taylor planted those balloons in her locker so she could blame it on me. She hates me. - This is ridiculous, I'm gonna go call her mother. - No, no, no, please don't do that. Please don't, it'll just make it so much worse. I'll stay away from her, I promise. - If you want to be on the team so badly, I don't think avoiding her is the answer. - I actually got on the team. Coach asked me to replace madison. She'll announce it soon, and this time taylor can't stop me. - Well, I'm happy for you, but any time anything happens at school, no matter what you come to me right away, got it? 150,000 views, wow. People really don't have anything to do with their time. - Okay, so let's review. We tell coach that we've decided we can rework the formations with just the seven of us. You'll back me up. - [April] as always. - We just don't need the drama right now. You know, the big game is on Friday, and we don't have time to rework the new... - (whistling) ladies, gather round. I greatly appreciate you all being here under difficult circumstances. Madison was one of our best and we're really gonna miss her. Now considering what's happened, I thought it might be best to break up the team and form a new one. But we've come too far and worked too hard to stop now. - Exactly, which is why we've decided that we can rework the formations with just the seven of us. We don't need another. - Which is why I've asked darcy daniels to join the team. Darcy. In fact, darcy suggested the drone so we can get an all-around view of what works and what needs to be improved. I think it's a great idea. Darcy, why don't you tell everyone your idea. - Thanks, coach, for inviting me to join the team. I know I have some big shoes to fill. - You can never fill them. - You're right, taylor, but what I can do is offer a fresh perspective to some of the routines. My aunt uses this drone to show properties from all sides. I asked my aunt if I could borrow the drone so that way we can study our moves. Not to mention to see how great we look. Anyway, I'm here to do my part to make this the best team ever. - This already was the best team. - She's still grieving. I'll be right back. You guys practice the new formation, and darcy, why don't you go ahead and use the drone and record it. - Yeah, I wanna see that. - See, it's like right there. - Oh, wow. - Oh my gosh. That's us. - Right, that's us. - Hey, look, I know you're upset about madison's death. - I'm doing what I should've done in the first place, sending the school board a little message about your extra-curricular activities. - You do that and make sure you add that principal harris has filed for divorce and is moving out soon. Stay or leave, but don't play stupid power games which you'll never win. (somber music) - you all right? - Warren, hi. No, I'm not. I didn't know madison well, but it's just... - Yeah, it's devastating. Listen, when you're feeling better, let me know. We could go out, go to a concert, whatever. It might be nice. - Thank you, but right now I kinda just want to be alone. - Got it, yeah. Okay. - Look, we've both been a little rough on each other. But maybe we could, I don't know, try to be better for madison's sake. - I'm in. (dramatic music) - [darcy] hey, this is darcy, leave a message. - Hey, darcy, if you get this message, could you do me a favor and run by school and get the drone? I totally forgot there's a property I want to check out. I know it's Saturday, so if you're busy, it's no big deal. All right, see you later. (drone buzzing) - what the? (dramatic music) - [brandon] what the heck? Whoa! (scooter clattering) - mrs. Tyler, I assure you tim is the best contractor on that list. I highly recommend him. I'm so sorry, can I call you back? (brandon groaning) are you okay? - I'm fine. - What happened? - Some drone came out of nowhere. - What? - Yeah, I was trying to get away, but then I lost control. - Okay, I'm calling 911. - No, no, no, you don't... - no, stay down, okay? I'm not going anywhere until we get some help. - [dispatcher] 911, what's your emergency? - Hi, yes, there's been an accident on 24266 carson. - Mrs. Hollister, we came as soon as we heard. May we come in? - Well, just for a short time. He's had quite a day already. - [brandon] you're a good artist. First autograph, cool. - Bae, are you okay? I was so worried, I came straight here. - How did you even find out what happened? - Darcy texted me. - Well, thank you for dropping by, but you didn't have to. - Of course I did, you've been injured. - Aunt cassie, this is taylor and April form the cheerleading team. Taylor is the captain. - Well, it's nice to meet you girls. I've heard a lot about you, taylor. - I bet you have. I'm sorry, I'm just not sure what you're doing here. - I invited her. Darcy's aunt found me on the street and called 911. If she hadn't found me, I'd be in much worse shape. Thank you again, miss tuxford. - No need to thank me. I did what any good citizen would do. - You, you sent that drone not for him, for me. - What? - I was jogging on that same street and I saw the drone headed straight for me. I had to race away so I didn't get hurt. You have the drone, you did it. - Taylor, the drone's in my locker. Sorry, aunt cassie, I didn't have time to get it. - It's okay, sweetie. - And why would I want to hurt you? Someone was obviously going after brandon. - No, brandon was just there at the wrong time. It was meant for me. - Taylor, you're delusional. - Taylor doesn't really mean what she said. - I can talk for myself. - She's just a little emotional right now. - Right now? I can't even make a move without her accusing me of something. - Darcy. - I apologize, it's just when I think that brandon could be seriously hurt, I just loose my mind. - Would anyone like some iced tea? G my friend. - [cassie] of course. - [darcy] I'm sorry you missed your meetings. - Well, today was an interesting day, wasn't it? - And now you know who taylor is and how much she hates me. - All right, you've got to stop saying that. She doesn't hate you. She was definitely upset though. - I think she was more upset that I was at brandon's house, not that he had a cast on his arm. I wouldn't even be surprised if she sent the drone herself to make it look like I did it. - That's insane. Why would she go to that extreme? - Like I said, she hates me. - [cassie] what is going on here? - [darcy] who are they? - Good afternoon, cassandra tuxford? - I might be. - I'm detective gray, this is detective martinez. - Is there a problem? - There might be. - Please, right this way. Okay, detective, let me make sure I understand what's going on. So because I have a drone, I'm being questioned about brandon hollister's accident. - Not exactly. - So then why are you here? - Could you just confirm the events of earlier this afternoon? - Don't you have the police report? - We would just like you to confirm, mam, that's all. - I can't believe this. Okay, I'm a real estate agent. I was out looking at properties, and I saw brandon on the side of the road clearly hurt. I called 911 and I stayed with him until they got there. - And where's your drone? - I'm sorry? - Do you know where your drone is? - What does that have to do with anything? - The thing is, miss tuxford, we have reason to believe that the real target was taylor jennings. - She told us the drone was following her shortly before brandon's accident. - Yes, we know that. We just saw her 30 minutes ago. What, are you implying that I sent my drone after her? - No, we think your niece did. - That is outrageous, darcy did nothing of the sort. - But you do have a drone, don't you? - In my locker at school. - That's not that far from here. Did you send that drone after taylor? - Why are you even asking me when taylor already told you everything except for the truth? I didn't do it. - Well, miss jennings seems to think that you have a vendetta against her. - Well, miss jennings can't stand the fact that coach phillips put me on the cheerleading team and that her ex doesn't want to get back together with her. If anyone has a vendetta, it's her against me. - Miss tuxford, are you aware that your niece has a criminal record? - I'm sure you've made a terrible mistake. - Someone did. We're sorry to have interrupted your afternoon. We'll let you know if we need any more information. - I can't imagine what that would be. - Does anyone else know your combination for your school locker? - Not unless you do. - Have a nice evening. - It's too late for that. Darcy, what are you doing? - You don't want a criminal living here, do you? - I never said you were a criminal. Now tell me, what were they talking about? - No. - Answer me. - Check fraud, shoplifting, disturbing the peace, and arson. - What? - The first time was a joke. The second time was an accident, I swear. Mom and I were at this halfway house and she was super cold, and I lit a bonfire. It was just a dumb mistake. - Why didn't I know about any of this? Why didn't you call me? I could've given you food and shelter and money, anything you needed. - Mom wouldn't let me. She said that you helped her one time, and she just blew it all on drugs and drinks. - Yeah, well you still should've called me. God, I was so focused on being successful that I wasn't paying attention to what was happening between you and your mom. I should've been there for you. - It's okay, aunt cassie. - No, it's not okay. I failed you, and I'm gonna fix this, okay? I'm gonna fix it. - There's nothing to fix. You didn't fail me. And I promise I'll never do those stupid things again. - Darcy, I would never judge you. - No, that's taylor's job. No matter where I go to school, there is always gonna be a taylor. - That's right, there will always be a taylor. And until you came along, no one has ever challenged her. You are just as talented and as beautiful, and she doesn't like it. - Thanks for the compliments, but it doesn't make a difference now. - I don't follow. - Do you really think that taylor's gonna stop with the drone? She's not gonna give up until she finds a way to blame me for madison's murder. - What? - Her parents ordered an autopsy. Apparently she died from blunt force injury to the head, not from slipping in the shower. - That's shocking, and I feel even worse for her parents. But who's being delusional now? Taylor has no control over you. Put your things away. (dramatic music) to transparent. It's like she's got this list. Steal taylor's boyfriend, check. - Taylor, she didn't steal... - Kill an amazon to get on the team, check. Ingratiate yourself with the other members, check. I just wish she would go away forever. - (whistling) okay, let's do the new formation. - Ready? Five, six, seven, eight. ♪ We're fired up, we're sizzling hot ♪ ♪ we've got the heat and will not stop ♪ ♪ amazons compete ♪ ♪ we can't be beat ♪ - again, new formations. Good job, darcy, you're killing it. - Five, six, seven, eight. ♪ We're fired up, we're sizzling hot ♪ ♪ we've got the beat and will not stop ♪ ♪ amazons compete ♪ (taylor shouts) - timeout, timeout. - Here. - I don't need your help. - Look, the big game is coming up. I know there's bad blood between you two, but you need to get along. So I've made a decision. From this point forward, darcy will be co-captain of this team. - What? - Coach, taylor doesn't need a co-captain. She knows... - I said I've made a decision. - Sorry, I didn't mean to... - [janice] darcy to the front, take April's position. April to the back. - But I'm always next to taylor. - [janice] to the back. - I'm sorry, we're called the amazons, not the arsonists. (dramatic music) - taylor. - Ow! - Hey! - Girls, break it up. Girls, break it up now. Okay, that's enough. Girls, stop it. - Get off me! - All right, that's enough. - Stop it! - Help me! - Stop helping her! - Taylor, hey, knock it off! Both of you are dismissed immediately. I will not let you destroy this team. - But... - No, now. You too, taylor, we'll survive without you. All right, guys, let's get back to work. - I already told you, you don't have to drive me home. - You said this was a rough day. - Yeah, well my whole life has been rough. Don't waste your time with me. - I thought you liked me. - It doesn't matter, I'm a bad luck charm. My boyfriends have a shelf life of about a week tops. - Well, I'm not them. - Hey, I gave you a chance today. You blew it. You've got potential, darcy, but first learn how to control your temper, understand? Do that and you can come back. - What was that about? - Let's go out tonight, like on a date. - Really? - Yeah, meet me back here later. But there's something I have to do first. I'll text you when I'm done. - Yeah, cool, cool. (phone buzzing) - taylor, everything okay? - No, it's not. Can you meet up with me like right now? I could really use your help. - Of course, I'm always available for you. But you know I can't go out late. - Late? It's like 8:00 p.M., your parents are way overprotective. Are you already in your jammies all tucked in? I'm sorry, that was cruel, I didn't mean to... - It's okay. - I just need a new plan. I can't let darcy destroy the amazons. - Of course not, we are never going to let that happen. Okay, so just tell me where you want me to... (phone buzzing) - [taylor] hello, April, April? - [April] sorry, I'm here. - You can't go, can you? April, you can't keep letting your parents control your life. - They just want to make sure I'm okay. Look, I really do want to help you, but I have... - nevermind, I'll figure something out, gotta go. (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (phone buzzing) - what the? (coach gasping) (horn honking) (torch hissing) (dramatic music) (phone dinging) - that's my aunt again, I have to go. - But you were late. I hardly got to spend any time with you. - I told you I had stuff to do. We'll see each other tomorrow. - Don't you want to introduce me to your aunt? I mean, we're gonna be seeing each other more, right? Look, I know I'm not brandon, but... - I don't care about brandon. - Then what is it? - You're just the first guy I've really liked, okay? Just don't push me. - Okay. (dramatic music) - thank god you're home. Do you know how late it is? Are you all right? - Yeah, I'm going to bed. - No, I deserve to know where you were. What if something had happened to you? - Nothing happened. I was out on date, that's all. - You were out on a date looking like that. - I didn't dress up for it, okay? I didn't want to make a big deal out of it just in case it was a disaster. - Well, was it? - No. - Oh, well that's great, but you need to check in with me, okay? That's just a basic ground rule. Okay, so what did you guys do? - Coach made me co-captain of the team today. - Well, that's wonderful, but tell me more about your date. - And then taylor called me an arsonist and we got in this huge fight, and then coach kicked us both off the team just like that. - Darcy, what did I tell you about getting into fights? - I know, I'm sorry. It's just I don't understand why coach kicked us both off the team when it was so pathetically obvious that it was taylor who started it. God, I wish she was the one who slipped in the shower. - Don't say things like that. - I have to go to bed. - And you don't have any idea what time she checked in? - I told your partner here she didn't check in, okay? She was probably visiting a friend who was already here. - What kind of a friend? - I don't know or care. - Don't you monitor who comes in and out of this place? - Yeah, let me get the videotape for you, shall I? No, what people do in the privacy of their own room is none of my business, okay? - So you're running a house of prostitution. - Will you give me a break? I've been here for 15 years without any trouble, okay? Just because some psycho strangled some loser girl to death doesn't mean they stayed at my motel. - Yeah, because that kind of person would only stay at a much nicer motel. - Get me the guest roster. - The guest roster? What, did you start yesterday? Fyi, people don't use their real names. - What about credit cards? - What about 'em? Cash or prepaid cards. And if they don't tear up the room, I don't give a damn what they do. - Well, somebody might, so get me that roster now. - Sure. - And in breaking news this morning, a locklear high teacher was found brutally murdered inside her car outside this motel. Janice phillips, a coach at locklear high school, was discovered early this morning by the manager of this motel. There are no other details at this time. - [cassie] hey, darcy, I hope you enjoy your life in jail. - What are you doing? - Darcy, I have some terrible news. - What terrible news? - I think you should sit down. Coach phillips was murdered last night. I'm so sorry. - What, how, when? - I just heard about it. It happened in her car. I can't believe it. - It's all making sense. - What are you talking about? - Taylor, she's behind all of this. - Okay, I don't understand. - I think you do. Isn't that why you're looking at my phone, for clues? Why were you looking at my phone? In jail, what? This has to be taylor. - Don't lie to me. You tell me the truth, where were you last night? - I'm not lying to you. Wait, you don't think that I had something to do with coach phillips getting killed, do you? This is from the fight I got into with taylor. Oh my god, you really think I killed her? - No, of course I don't. I just, I'm worried. Do you have something to tell me? Are you in some kind of trouble? Why weren't you answering any of my phone calls last night? It wasn't just a date, was it? - I don't have to give you a blow-by-blow. But since you're asking, I did go out with someone. He doesn't care about my past and, oh, he doesn't think I'm a murderer. - I didn't say you were a murderer. - But you're thinking it. - Where are you going? - Anywhere that isn't here. - Okay, please, you don't have to do this. I am responsible for taking care of you. - Yeah, well you're about 16 years too late. Get out. - Darcy. - Get out! - Darcy. - Get out! - Darcy. - Go away. - Darcy, darcy. Look, I have to go to work. There is breakfast in the fridge. You don't have to leave. How? - It doesn't make any sense. - Darcy, I'm so sorry about coach phillips. Do you want me to walk with you? - I'm actually pretty busy right now, so. Do you think you could, nevermind. - What? - Do you could meet me in the parking lot after school today? I need help researching a place to hang out for a while. - Is something wrong? I mean, you could stay with me. I'd have to ask my parents first, but... - Just meet me there, okay? - Okay, okay. - That would be cute, right? - Right. - Okay, I'll see you later. - Yeah, see you at practice. Principal harris, I am so sorry. This is horrible. Do you know when the funeral will be? I'll make sure all the amazons are there. What can I do? How can I help? - Do you know why that officer was here? He was here to question me about coach phillips. A detective talked to my wife this morning. I would've never done anything to hurt her. I loved her. Now I might be a suspect in her murder. - What? Oh, no, no, no, no, no. - Oh, now you care, taylor? You would've been happy to destroy her career and mine too. You want to help, hm? Stay away. (dramatic music) - the big game is tomorrow night, and I know we're all in shock. Coach and I didn't really see eye-to-eye on everything, but she had faith and encouraged me to be the best that I could be, that we could be. So I am asking humbly to be reinstated as your captain. I want us to honor coach. I want us to really come together and be the team she wanted us to be and... - and don't worry, this is my last day at locklear. You've made it pretty clear that you don't want me here. And you know what, the feeling is mutual. - Wait, I'm sorry. - Good luck, guys. Maybe I'll see you around, or not. - Darcy. - Come on, darcy. - I'll get her back. Let me smooth things over with her after school. She's a troublemaker, but she's an amazing cheerleader. And we need her. - You're right, April, you always are. All right, I'll see you guys at practice later. Remember, this one's for coach phillips. - Yeah, for coach. - Ready, for coach. - For coach. - For coach. - [taylor] ready, for coach. - [all] for coach. - Oh, I keep meaning to tell you. Do you remember those ranch homes on trevor hill where we used to have the bonfire parties after the game? - Mhm. - My parents just bought one of them. - For what? There's nothing for like miles. - They thought it would be a good place to get away form everything. You know, like a vacation home. We could just head out there, you and me. Watch movies, chill. You could stay as long as you like. - Girl, if I'm gonna go on a vacation, I'm gonna surf or ski at a five-star resort, not some stupid house in the middle of nowhere. - You're right, it would probably be boring. - Right? And I really appreciate you offering to talk to darcy, but I think I should be the one to do it. Even though we don't agree on like anything. - That's why I should do it. - Yeah, no, I should do it. I'm sorry, you're just trying to be helpful, and I'm not even letting you. - I promise I'm gonna take care of everything. You don't have to worry about darcy anymore. - Great, I'll see you at practice. - I heard the news about coach. I'm really sorry. - Dear aunt cassie, I know you want to help me, but I think I'm better off on my own. I'm used to fending for myself, so please don't worry about me. I'll be all right. Maybe when you can stop doubting me, we can try again. Love always, darcy. (dramatic music) (blow thudding) (darcy shouting) ow! What are you doing? Ow! It's you. Hey, this is darcy, leave a message. - Darcy, I am so sorry about this morning, okay? Please call me back. (dramatic music) I'll make it up to you. Darcy? - [darcy] dear aunt cassie, I know you want to help me, but I think I'm better off on my own. (dramatic music) - let me out! Let me out! Let me out! (darcy shouting) (darcy shouting) (phone buzzing) - oh my god. (darcy shouting) - [darcy] let me go! Let me go! - Shut up, I am trying to think! - One and two, three and four, five, six. Good, seven, eight. Ready, finale. Ready, five, six, seven, eight. ♪ Amazons will cheer you on ♪ ♪ we've got your back, now go attack ♪ - where is she? Where is my niece? - Oh, mrs. Tuxford, I don't know, I'm sorry. - Don't lie to me. I found her phone and there was over 10 text messages from you telling her to be here asap. - Wait, you found her phone? - Yes, I want home, my front door was open, her bags were sitting there, and she left this note saying she was leaving. - Wait, her suitcase. I don't understand. April was supposed to... - April was supposed to what? - Well, darcy said today was her last day at the school, so April was supposed to go convince her to come to the big game. But I haven't seen her, so I texted them both. - I'm calling the police. - Wait, police. I think I misinterpreted something April said. - I promise I'm gonna take care of everything. You don't have to worry about darcy anymore. - Where the hell is darcy? - There's a house on trevor road. I think April might've taken darcy there. - What are you talking about? - We better leave like now. (darcy mumbling) - what? - Why are you doing this to me? I was always nice to you. - You were, but you weren't nice to taylor. And every time you hurt her, you hurt me. Taylor is perfect, but you can't seem to understand that, can you? Did you know that people stop whatever they're doing when taylor walks into a room? That's how beautiful she is. And she chose me, me, to be her best friend. Taylor is the only person who understands my problems. - Come on, please. - No, no, I said no. (electricity buzzing) (boy groaning) - like my new stun gun? Are you okay? Okay, come on. - She accepts me. Not even my own parents do that. - April, I accept you. I've always... - I told you to get on her good side, but you didn't listen to me. Why didn't you listen to me? - Has she responded yet? - No, nothing. - I should've listened, I'm sorry. I should've been nicer to taylor. - You mean that? - Yes. And April, I'll be your friend. - You will? - Of course. I know what it's like to feel different. And if you just let me go, I promise I won't tell anybody about this. In fact I was moving away, which is why I had the suitcase. - You were going to move? - Yeah, I mean, I finally realized I was never gonna be an amazon. So if you just let me go, I swear... - you're right, you will never be an amazon. Because you aren't good enough to lick taylor's boots. I heard you talking to madison before I had to kill her, although that's not your fault. But everything else is. (darcy mumbling) don't worry, after I set you on fire, you won't have to worry about breathing anymore. - Am I going the right way? This is so far. How are we gonna find her? - [taylor] the nav says it's the next left. - Oh, I'm also gonna burn this dump down. (darcy mumbling) see, that's why you're here. Because you're an arsonist. Won't be any great stretch to connect all the dots back to you. Besides, taylor doesn't like it. I mean, it's just some stupid old house in the middle of nowhere. Who would want to stay here? Don't go anywhere, I'll be right back. - Is this the place? - That's April's car. - Why's the trunk open? Stay here, be ready to call the police. - But... - No. - Okay. - [cassie] darcy? Darcy? - Not a peep, otherwise I light this up. - Darcy, are you here? Darcy? Darcy. Darcy? Darcy? Hello? I don't know. Darcy? Darcy? Darcy? Darcy? Darcy? Darcy? (darcy shouting) (blow thudding) - why, why did you have to come here? You were such a nice person, and now I'm gonna have to kill you both. - Stop, give it to me. April, what are you doing? - I'm helping you. - Are you all right? Okay, come on. Let me help you with that, easy, easy. Come on, come on. - Watch out! - She hurt you, and she would've kept on hurting you. I had to stop her. - She didn't hurt me. She didn't hurt anyone. I was wrong. I am so, so, so sorry. - You told me you wanted her to feel your pain. - April, let her go. - Shut up or I'll kill her right in front of you. Don't you understand? I did this all for you. I sent that drone after brandon because he humiliated you. - But I love brandon, I wouldn't... - and I had to kill coach because she dismissed you. And tracy trench, she deserved to fall down those bleachers. You said she wasn't good enough. - That was a joke. - And madison, I really didn't want to kill her, but she tried to take you away from me. - What? April, you're sick, you need help. - You said you wish darcy would go away. - [taylor] people say things when they're angry. That's all it was. She did nothing wrong. You gotta let us go. - Let you go? Let you go? Change of plans. I was gonna kill darcy and burn this place down because you didn't like it, but now you know too much. So I'm gonna have to kill you too. And then I'll mrs. Tuxford and then darcy because she just didn't listen to me. And I'll be forgiven because I forgot to take my meds. There's so, so many of them, and none of them work. I had such great plans for us. I loved you so much. It would've been beautiful. We would've traveled the world together. Done whatever we wanted. A lifetime together, just you and I. (darcy shouting) (blow thudding) - there's gasoline everywhere. Get my aunt cassie and call 911. - But... - Go! - Okay, come on. There you go, come on. Come on. - [April] darcy. - Oh my god, April, are you okay? April, wake up. Please stay with me, stay with me, okay. (flesh squishing) (darcy screaming) - why didn't you listen to me? I told you to listen to me! I warned you, darcy! (flesh squishing) (April gasping) when you said you would be my friend, did you really mean it? - I did. April, April? - [officer] freeze! - [officer] drop the weapon! - Show us your hands. Show us your hands. - [officer] drop the weapon. - This was all I could find. - I think there's more on the kitchen counter in a bag. And that can go up a little bit higher too. - Isn't it beautiful? - [warren] that's perfect. - She's gonna love it. - You can set it down right here. - [girl] how does this look? - Oh, no, that looks great. - [cassie] don't lie to me. You tell me the truth, where were you last night? - [medic] I'm sorry, she's gone. - Mom, please stay with me! Mom, I love you, I love you, I love you. Mom, please. Mom, don't leave me. Get off of me! Mom, please, please wake up, mom please. (sirens blaring) (darcy shouting) - honey, your guests are arriving. - Sorry, I'll be right down. - I was just thinking about how different things are now. How lucky I've been. But I still really miss mom. I can't believe it's almost been a year. - Me either. - I wish she could meet warren, I wish she could be at this birthday, and I really wish she could see the amazons. I think she'd be so proud. - She would be, I know it. - Anyway, what I really want to say is thank you for being there for me. - I always will be. (doorbell ringing) oh, I'll get it. - No, I'll get it. It's time I come down anyway. - Are you getting the door? - Yeah, I got it. What are you hiding? - Nothing. - I hope you're feeling better. I wanted to bring this by just whenever you're ready for it. - Thanks. - I heard it was your birthday, so I just got you this. Okay, I should get going. - I actually saw some cake in there. (upbeat electronic music) it's really big, I'm gonna need some help to eat it.
