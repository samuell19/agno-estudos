You were smoking in the bathroom. Yeah. I always light to have a cigarette after I come, you know? [sighs] Well, then I guess you're aware that it's a federal offense with a $3,000 fine. Really? And that you put every single one of these passengers in jeopardy. I'm sorry. You know, it's my job to report you to the authorities when we land, and I'm going to. SOL: Don't. What? Ugh. You're making me think about doing some things. Get off me! Huh? Don't look at her. Hey! Jerk. I can't believe your ass. Good help really is hard to find, Max. [panting, rattling] Julie!

Roger that, ground control. Over. It's that bad, Jerry? We have to turn around? Afraid so. Sorry about that. Well, you heard him, Sully. Let's turn her around. SULLY: You got it. Ugh. JERRY: Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. As you know, we've been flying through a storm, and as you can see, it's been getting worse. So we are returning to Anaheim.

You stay nice and calm, and you'll have a great story to tell the kiddies. However, my friend Sol over here would like nothing other than to blow one of your motherfucking heads off. OK? Got it? Blondie? Blondie, come here. Come here. Don't make me fucking come and get you. Come on. Let's you. Let's fucking go right now. Move your sweet ass. Don't make me tell you twice. You too. Inside.

[mariachi music] MAN: I'm gonna get you, [inaudible].. [chatter] No, no, no, no, no, you don't understand. I was just at the airport. No. And they said it was canceled. [cash register ding] I'm calling you because you're the goddamn airline. Hello? Hello? God damn it. Does anything work around here? I sure do, sweetie. No. No, no, no, no, no, gracias. - Come sit by me, handsome. No. No. No, gracias. - Oh. [inaudible] NEWS (ON TV): Flight 211 disappeared in today's surprise storm. Authorities lost all contact of the aircraft some two hours into its flight. Although scoring 100% on-- Oh my god. NEWS (ON TV): --its recent maintenance checkup-- Oh my god. NEWS (ON TV): --authorities are not ruling out the possibility of mechanical failure. My girlfriend. My girlfriend was on that flight. Relax, senor. Relax. They said they've only just started searching. Don't worry. They will find her. It crashed. And you, you're just sitting there. What's wrong with you? Get off your ass and do something. I will appreciate you lowering your voice. You lost a fucking plane, and you want me to lower my voice? I need the embassy. Where's the American embassy? Senor, control yourself. We are doing everything we can. You don't fucking get it, do you? My girlfriend is on that plane, and it crashed. Gentlemen. [glass shatters] The American embassy is 500 miles away, compadre. See ya later, Rosa. [giggling] How do I get to the American embassy? You don't want the American embassy, kid. You don't want all that red tape and foreign bullshit. What you want is a tracker. You know what a tracker is. A tracker's a-- someone finds lost things. All right, you know somebody like that? MAX: Let's go. Let's go. All right, we're going. We're going. SOL: Let's move it. [inaudible] Hey. Hey! - Move it. Set it down right over there. Move it. What's in here, concrete? Get over there. Hey, keep moving, fuck. Fuckin' ass. MAX: Hurry it up. Sol, there's three more in there. Yeah, I know, man. That's all we could get, man. [screaming] Oh my god! Jerry! Oh my god! [screaming] No! [crying] [gunshots] [roaring] [gunshots] Geez.

[screams] A little trophy for you, baby. All right, all right, enough. Now here is where the real adventure begins. Move it out. Let's go. Let's go. Pick it up. Let's go. You, get a case. You, [inaudible] pick it up. Take care of it. [inaudible], wake up. [groaning] Wake up. [groans] Who the fuck are you? I'm Zach Fowler. I'm sorry, I, uh, I just drank too much, all right? ZACH: Yeah, I could tell. Yeah. Hey, wait. Wait. I remember you now. You're the kid from the [inaudible].. Yeah. And you're supposed to be the best tracker around, huh? What did you expect, Lancelot, hm? Jesus. Wait, wait, wait. Hey, kid, you don't want to go to a plane crash. Yes, I do. Look, if there's a chance of her being alive, then I want to find it. OK? Yeah, well, you know what people look like when you find them in a plane crash? Do you want the job or not? Things like this don't come-- they're expensive. Money is not a problem, OK? I got money. You see? Huh? That's not enough to buy breakfast. Yeah, well, her parents are loaded too. OK? Her dad started an internet company. You know, internet. Look, anyway, they're filthy rich, OK? It doesn't matter. She flies around the world off of her trust fund. All right. This is-- this my minimum offer-- $3,000. You pay for everything, and I get to keep what I find. Fine. You got it. Listen, kid, I'll tell you one thing. We've got to do this in a hurry, because if they went down in the swamp where I think they went down, not too many people make it out alive, OK? OK. MAX: Lights! JULIE: OK. OK. MAX: Give me the fucking light. This water smells like ass. That's methane. It's the number one cause of wildfires in swampy areas. If you light that up, it goes boom. [smack] Ugh! Leave him alone. He's in shock! That boy's brain is mush. What? Hey, he's right. It works. This ain't some male bonding camping trip. Now, move. Hey, we're carrying this stuff, aren't we? Shh. Sol? SOL: Yo? You wanna take care of this. Yup. No, no, no, no. No, don't. Please-- please don't kill me. God, no. [inaudible] You're gonna carry the luggage, and you're not gonna complain, right? Yes. What? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Carry it. I'll carry it. I'll carry it. No problem. Give me a nail, kid. MAX: Light, dammit. Fuck. I can smoke now, right? Sure. That's what I thought. [bugs buzzing] JULIE: The black box? Where did you get it? MIA: Jerry pulled it from the cockpit. So this is a black box? This is it? Keep it down. So this thing, it can track us? MIA: Yeah. They probably found the plane already. And they're on their way. No. They wouldn't have been able to launch a full search until this weather cleared. And then when they find the plane, they'll dredge the water around the crash site first. And then, they'll expand the search. It's going to take them some time to even figure out we're missing. Great. Fuck me. What? Was there ever a better time? Let me see this. Mm, I'm gonna be needing those. Hey, is that alcohol? Give it to me. JUSTIN: Wait, you, really shouldn't mix those. You're not do what I think you're doing. Yeah, I am. What do you-- what do you think she's doing? Well, you can't use them all. I'm going to need at least five. Well, there's not enough. You can have two. Three. Oh. Oh, no, no, no. You can't do that. They'll kill us. They're not going to kill us anyway? Oh, no, no, no. I don't want any part of this. You can count me out, OK? Forget it. It's better to die on your feet than to live on your knees. MAX: Shut up. He's got a point, doesn't he? Hmph. I don't mind living on my knees. MAX: Sol, you-- Why doesn't that surprise me? --you tie them up. Mhm. Squid, you'll stand first watch tonight. Aw, man, I'm wasted, Max. Give it-- MAX: Can it. You really don't have-- look, we're not going to run away. I mean, you're in complete control of the situation, and I respect your authority. [yells] Would you like room service with that? Ow. You sleep OK, OK? Get some sleep. [growling] [roaring] [CRICKETS CHIRPING, FIRE CRACKLING] [bugs buzzing] Are you sure you want to do this? Yes. It won't work. Shh. Be quiet. Be careful. [grunts] Might as well go back to sleep. We're not going to be moving for a while. I can't sleep. Can't I just come keep you company for a minute? Hm. Shh. Reach in my front pocket. Go ahead, my front pocket. Go ahead. Where'd you get that? The plane. Come on, untie me, and we'll have a nightcap. Why the fuck not? Cheers. Cheers. [clink] So you think we're almost there? Oh, god I hope so, because I can't stand this fucking place. I hear you. Reminds of when my parents used to take me camping. Hated that too. Down. What's in those cases? They so fucking heavy. Wouldn't you like to know? [laughs] Here. You don't want that? Hm, too strong. Oh, yeah? Come on. You can tell me. Well, it's a long story. You got a little time? [laughs] A little time. First thing you have to-- have to understand is that all vault lockups work on computers. Really? Oh, yeah. They're always trying to-- always trying to beef them up with high-speed chips and infrared locks, new lines of code. And I'm saying this with all honesty, I'm the best there is. [whimpers] Wow. And my name is Jack. Jack? Uh-huh. [panting] Just knock them down. I mean, that's really all there is to it. It's more technical than that, you know. Yeah. You do understand what I'm saying, yeah? Of course. Well, you say it with me now, then. You just-- - Knock them-- - --up. --up. BOTH: --to set them down. You're a smart girl. Sleepy. Mm. [whimpering] SQUID: Ah. Uh. [panting] MIA: Come on. Keep going. Hurry up. Come on. [thunder] Shit. Get up. I got them. What the-- wake up, motherfucker. Where are they? Where are they? - What? [smack] - Ugh. [thud] Where the fuck is your gun? I don't know. Where the fuck is your gun? I don't know! I'll tell you something, motherfucker. You better hope that I find them. Ugh. Sol! You go get their ass. Where are we-- where are we going? MIA: Back to the plane. [groaning] [splash] What was that? They're right behind us. Shit. Come on! [panting] [growling] Go! Go! Let's go! Let's keep moving. Come on! [splashing] Move. All right. I told you this was a bad idea. Shut up and run! I had nothing to do with this! It's this way! No, it's this way. This is the way out. Come on! Come on! I know the way! [panting] Ah! Go get him. [inaudible] We've got you. JULIE: I've got the flight recorder. [screaming] (SCREAMING) Help! Help me! Help! Help me! [screaming] [gunshots] Help me! [gunshots] No! No! No! Julie! Holy fuck. Let's go. - No! No! - Fuck. Let's go. [growling, chomping] [roaring] Let's go. Let's go. Come on. He's right behind you. Go! He's right behind us. Go! Run! God, what the hell is that? [panting] Come on! It's gaining on us. Go! Come on. [panting] Move. Go. MIA: It's this way! BRIAN: No, go left. Go left! (SCREAMS) Motherfuckers! Motherfuckers! [smack] (SCREAMS) SOL: Fuck. Come here, you piece of shit. Come here. Come here. No! No! No! MAX: Be quiet, all of you. Something-- [thud] - Shut your mouth! - [groans] It's back there, man. It's coming this way. Put your hands behind your motherfucking head now! Shut up. JUSTIN: Please-- Shut up. Where's the other bitch at? It came out of the water in the air. It was a crocodile! BRIAN: It was fucking huge, man. It was bigger than the last one. SQUID: Hey, let us kill these motherfuckers. Listen. Just let us go. We didn't take any of your-- MAX: Shut your mouth. --fucking money. MIA: No! No! No, no, no! No, no! It was my idea. It was my idea! Don't listen to her, Max. She's a lying bitch. No, that's not true. I convinced them to do it. Oh, shut up, bitch! MAX: You better be motherfucking right. Consider this a stay of execution, bitch. - Ah! - Go on. All right. Go on. I'll kill your fucking ass. Come on. Come on. Go! Let's go. Pick it up, double-time. So this thing can pick up a black box signal from way up here? No problem. Good tracking device is a pilot's best friend. You know, back in '78, I had to use a tracking device. I had to get myself a-- what was that tracking? A one-- a single-engine FlySpotter. Found out it was sunk 10 feet in the mud. And that baby found it. The salvage on that one was something special. I must have cleared about $4,500 and didn't get a-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Look, if I'm paying for this, we've got to set some ground rules right now, OK? I don't want to hear any more talk about salvage. We're looking for people. You got it? Sorry. How much farther we got, Max? Acapulco's southwest of here, man. We're head the wrong way. I think we should listen to him. I think he knows what he's talking about. Yeah, I don't know if the kid knows what the fuck he's talking about, but we should get to higher ground, because this water-- Will you shut the fuck up for once? Listen, I'm really trying to hold it together here, OK, but there's a fucking-- MIA: Justin! - --in the water. - Be quiet! Now, my only concern, which should be your only concern, is getting these objects from point A to point B. Yeah, OK, Max, but we've been out here for a fucking-- There's just a fucking thing in the water-- I think if we just turned around, we might be headed in the right direction. --that's gonna eat us. Do you understand? It wants to eat us. - Shut the fuck up! Now, I'm tired of hearing about this motherfucking crocodile. Take my shit to the end of the line, and I might let you live. Else, there's gonna be a trail of dead bodies. I'm telling you, man. I can get us out of here. Why don't you lead us, boy wonder? But I'm gonna tell you something-- you mislead us one time-- That's fine. (SCREAMS) MAX: Motherfucker! We know. We've been telling you there was a big croc after us. You didn't listen. We should go back, Max. We should go back. I agree with him. We should go back. Don't go fucking taking my side. Max, this isn't right. You said it was gonna be an easy job. You said we were going to fly to our rendezvous point, not march through a fucking jungle [inaudible].. We've got a lawyer. We've got a fucking savant. We've got a fucking slut. - Squid. And I am not losing my life. Motherfucker, you better pull it together now. I have enough to worry about with these fucking motherfuckers but not you. I cannot lose you. You hear me, motherfucker? Because I can guarantee you one thing. You keep this shit up, you will not make it out of here. I'll see to it myself. [helicopter] There it is, kid, El Pantano Diablo, the devil's swamp, a swamp bigger than the Everglades. The natives, they call it a sunken world where monsters live that could tear out your soul, send you straight to the underworld. [beeping] ZACH: What's that? ROLAND: : Aha, there she is. Just sit tight, kid. We'll be there in a minute. We're gonna do the rest of this search on the ground, kid. ZACH: There's nothing here. ROLAND: : Oh, I've got boats stashed here. We'll go up river north by northwest, take us right to the scene. [grunts] Well, this is it, kid. What is this place? Where I've got a little bit of everything. I don't think I want to know. Come on, kid. Home sweet home, boy. Here, pull this thing out. I'm sure you can assemble it. [grunts] Come on, just pull it out. All right. SOL: No fucking way. Ugh. Man, this is not a good idea. [chatter] Get up. Move! [beeping] This doesn't make any sense. What? What doesn't make any sense? According to this, we should be standing right on top of it. [sighs] Mia! Mia! Where the hell is it? Oh my god. Ah! ROLAND: : Don't move. Don't move a goddamn muscle. [growling] No. Stay real still, kid. Don't move. [gunshot] [roaring] [gunshots, roaring] Move! Move!

What the hell was that? Just come on. It ate the plane's flight recorder. [inaudible] It ate the what? It ate the plane's flight recorder. We haven't been tracking the plane. We've been tracking it.

Look, I don't have a problem with you guys. But you are trespassing in my swamp. What the fuck do you want? Her. SOL: Boy, I'm gonna say it again. Put that gun down before I get ready to skull fuck this boy. SQUID: Kill him, Sol. - No! SOL: Get back! [gasping] Anybody gets hurt, then you guys are never going to get out of here alive. (WHISPERING) I've got a jumper. Yeah? Where is it? Two clicks east. He's telling the truth. If I find out you're lying, motherfucker. Cut your bullshit, OK? I'm your only ticket out of here, like it or not. Squid! [gasps] [bubbling] [roaring] [screaming] Everybody, make it! Make it to the shack! [yelling] Come on, come on. Come on!

[inaudible] Go! Go! Go! [banging] [gunshots] [growling] I got you. Come here. [whimpers] Mia. [whimpering] Hey, come on! What are you waiting for? (CRYING) How did you find me? How did you know?

[gun clicks] Fucking things is all fucking bullshit. That's all-- Are you gonna fucking leave kindergarten and come help me? SOL: No. Come on, man. It's the fucking jaws of death out there, man. El diablo. What? It's an old legend. Years ago, the conquistadors, they hacked their way across the swamp, and they were carting all the stolen gold they got from the Aztecs. But only one of them got out alive. He spent his last years screaming about some dragon creature that came out of nowhere, that walked on land and walked on the water and tore them all to pieces. He chomped their armor like it was just paper. And when he was done, the swamp was consumed by fire. Now, the Spaniards, they had never seen anything like this before. But the natives knew. The natives knew what it was. They knew it was the creature that guarded the swamp against evil. So the natives, to protect themselves, at night, would chant the name, aligarto diablo, aligarto diablo. Thank you for that bit of information. It was incredibly helpful and relevant. I'm sorry, but, why don't we just go outside, go bust a cap in its ass like we did the last one? Your guns aren't going to stop this one. Be quiet. Be quiet. Be quiet. OK, folks, this is what we're gonna do. You and you are gonna go out there. You're going to go get that boat. You're gonna bring it back to me. No! Baby, it's OK. MIA: No, please. Please. Listen, it's getting dark. I mean, why don't I go? I mean, I know the area. That's actually a really good idea. That way when you leave here, you can just take off and not come back. [scoffs] You must really think I'm an idiot. No. The only one that has an incentive to come back-- and a lovely incentive it is-- is this one. Besides, only of you's gonna come back anyway, as far as I see it. The other one's just, um, a distraction. You mean bait, right? Mhm. And don't try anything, because I'll be watching you from the roof, and I'm a very, very good shot. Crocodile Dundee, you're coming with me. Sol? Yo. Take our little stewardess and go out there and retrieve our valuable. Why I got to go? What, I'm going to go retrieve them? And, and, and-- come here. What? Control yourself. Man. Hey. I want her alive. [panting] [crickets chirping] [panting] SOL: It's all right. I've got you covered. Let's go. Here. Can I come up now? Go get the other one. ROLAND: Those cases must be pretty valuable if you're lugging them all through the swamp. You know, there's no way you're goods and all of us are going fit into my boat. What's your point? Just curious. Just curious. What's the range on that thing? I don't, man, but I know it works. What does it do? Picks up the signal from the black box. Keep your eyes open, all right? For what, man, the croc or the boat? Both. [bird chirping, wings flapping] Hey, you hear that, man? What? Did I hear what? What? BRIAN: Nothing, man, nothing. Nothing. It's nothing. It's not. ZACH: Don't fucking do that to me, man. Just-- I thought-- I thought I heard something. [grunting] [thud] (PANTING) OK, that's all of them. (PANTING) You worried about your boyfriend? Yeah. Yeah? Me too. I'm sure he's all right. And you're with me, so you're all right too. I'm, um, I'm sorry about that smoking thing, you know? Listen, uh, I just wanted to say that I'm-- SOL: Stop right there. How do they do it? Like that? You look real nice there, Mia, like a model, like a artist. Thank you. Can't stop watching you, Mia. Even when I close my eyes, I can see you just as clear. What's he do for you? Zach? SOL: Mhm. I love Zach. I said, what's he do for you? I love Zach. See? You ain't never been with a real man. Make you feel like you went around the world and back. Poof. MIA: [panting] Boo! [whimpers] [grunts] [yells] [thud] [grunting] No! Please! No! No! [whimpering] No. No. No. No! [kissing] [whimpering] [crying] [panting] [grunting] [whimpering] Ugh! MIA: [screams] [groans] Ugh. [groans] Ah! [grunting] [gasping] [banging] SOL: [yells] [growling] [gasping] [thud] [rattling] [gunshots] No! No! All right, man. Come on. Come on. Put your arm around me. It's me. Relax. No! No! No! No! No! - It's OK. [thud] Whoa. Ugh. [splash] [grunts] [panting] Here. [groaning] [screams] [grunts] MIA: I've got you. Come on. [engine running] Hey! Don't try it, motherfucker. Don't you even think about it. Don't move! [groans] MIA: Zach, help! You better go, motherfucker. Oh, fuck you. I could blow you both away right the fuck now. MIA: Help! Come on. MIA: Zach! - I've got you, man. I've got you! [roars] [splash] MIA: I can't do it! [groaning] SOL: You got him, Max? [inaudible]. SOL: You got him? Yeah, I got his ass. He ain't gonna try shit. [banging] [grunting] Get him up. Get him up. [grunting] Pull my ass up. [roars] [banging] [screaming] [splash] [screams] Mia, towards the window. [yelping] Go. Swim to the side! He'll lose perspective on you. [gunshot] Find somewhere to hide. Stay close to the column-- close to the column! [gunshot] [roars] Throw it in his eyes. We've got to distract him. Aim at his eyes. MIA: [panting] [grunts] ZACH: Get back. Get back behind the pillar. MIA: [whimpering] Zach, look out! [gunshots] Anything here. Come on, pick up something heavy! [grunting] [growling] [gunshot] [roaring] [engine running] [gunshot] [roaring] Zach!

[splashing] [roaring] Get out! The place is coming down! [gasping] Come on. [growling] [roaring] [coughing] [screams] ROLAND: The place is gonna come down! We don't want to be anywhere close when it falls. [splashing] [creaking] They took the boat. [splash] Come on, we're gonna have to haul ass before they reach the chopper. Come on. Come on. I know a shortcut. [panting] Fucker. Motherfucker. Goddamn boat's deflating. Motherfucker! Fuck! - Calm down. Fucker, I am calmed down, fucking ass. Fucking piece of shit, motherfucking boat. Gather my fucking shit. You go get that motherfucking thing. I I've fucking had it. I don't get no more orders from you. I'll go my own fucking way. What the fuck is your problem? What the fuck is my problem? That's mine. That's mine. - That's fucking mine! - Calm the fuck down. SOL: [inaudible] - Calm down. I am calm, man. Ain't no bosses out here. There ain't no bosses out here. Ain't no more fucking orders. That's it. Ain't no more orders. We're survival of the fittest. That's all this is. We're in the fucking jungle. We're animals. You're a monkey, just like I am. And it's survival of the fucking fittest. Did you call me a fucking monkey? Go on. Take your shit. Get the fuck outta here. Take it. [inaudible], motherfucker. Go on. That's right. Every man for himself. You a survivor? You go survive. You'll just leave me like this? That's right. Yo, Sol. What? Sol. What? What? I'm sorry. Fine. [gunshot] [yells] Oh. You fuck! You fuck! [moaning] Give me this shit. [moaning] Good luck, motherfucker. SOL: Max! [gasping] [roar] [screaming] Be out of here in two minutes. [laughing] Look at this. We made it.

Uh, we were going to wait for you. Not today, motherfucker. Back up. Back up! Now, you're gonna get in that little blue chopper, and you're gonna fly me the fuck out of here. You want my help to get you out of here? 50%. You asshole! What are you doing? Shut the fuck up! Done. Move, buddy. ROLAND: OK. OK. ZACH: Roland, what the fuck are you doing, man? We had a goddamn deal. Hey, I got what I came for. You two got true love. I still got to buy it. Shut the fuck up. Get the fuck in the cockpit. Get back. Get back. Oh, no, no, no, no.
