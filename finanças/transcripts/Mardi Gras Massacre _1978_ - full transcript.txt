(subdued music) (people chattering) (laughing) - Hey, girls. How's tricks? - I don't know, Sam. You tell us. - How's the action tonight? - Feels like a pretty good night. A lot of johns. The gray suit type with tons of expense money. Maybe about 15 girls already scored. You're the first here for the late shift. - You take care of us, Sam, we'll take care of you. - You better or you ain't gonna ever score here again. - Stop the preaching, Sam. We take care of you. You know that. - And that's the way it's gonna stay. - [Man] Hey, Sam. How about your bar? (laughing) - Good evening, ladies. I'm new in the city and I'm looking for something different. - Well, if you have the money, you can have anything you want. All sizes, shapes, colors. If the price is right. - As I said, I am looking for something kinda special and I'm very willing to pay for it. - Ooh, with that kind of money, you can buy anything you want. - Tell me, of all the ladies in this bar tonight, which one do you think is the most evil? - Evil? - [Man] Mm-hmm. - The most evil, without a doubt, is Shirley. - Then, that's the one I want. Hello. I understand that you are the most evil woman here. - Listen, honey. I could probably take first prize in any evil contest. What do you want? - [Man] About $200 worth. - Well, for $200 I can't think of anything you can't have. - All right. I've got a little apartment a few blocks from here. Come with me now. - Wait a minute. You'll have to pay in advance. Now. Sam, will you hold this for me? - [Sam] You got it. - Apartment four? Four is my lucky number. - Oh, really? Welcome. Please, have a glass of wine. - I don't think I want any wine. - You must've noticed by now that I'm very different. - Yeah, about a hundred dollars worth of difference. What's your specialty, darling? What do you want? - What I want from you, I want to do in a very special place, on a very special kind of bed. Come with me in the next room and I will show you. I want you to take off your clothes and then lie down on this bed. And then I'll go in the next room and prepare for you. - Anything you say, honey. (ominous music) You scared me. You are weird, aren't you? - [Man] Yes. More different than you've ever known before. Lie down. I will make you feel wonderful. - [Shirley] Mm, that feels good. - [Man] Yes. Oh, yes. - [Shirley] Maybe I should pay you for this. - [Man] Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. (Shirley moans) Yes. Yes. - [Shirley] Hey, what are you doing? - [Man] You said that you were the most evil. Well, I am going to sacrifice you to the evil. (uptempo music) As you are one of their kind. - [Shirley] Hey, what is this? (Shirley screams) - [Man] Scream all you want. The room is soundproof. Now, your hand. - [Shirley] No. - The hand that accepted the money for your evil. - [Shirley] No, no, no! (Shirley screaming) No, no! - [Man] Now, your feet. - [Shirley] No! Please, stop! - Your feet that carried you to the deed. - [Shirley] No! (screaming) - [Man] And now for the part of you you use for your evil. (Shirley screams) (uptempo music) (ominous music) - This is a different one. In 25 years of medicine, I've never seen anything like it before. It's sort of like it's ritualistic or a sacrificial type of killing. - We've got the girl's name. It's Shirley Anderson. She's a hooker. - We've checked the homicide records to find a comparison to this type of killing. - Yeah, we went back about to the 1800s. There's nothing like this in New Orleans, anyway. So, we've turned it over to INTERPOL and the FBI. I don't know, there's something strange about this. It's ritual or sacrificial. - You know, I believe the perpetrator of this murder has to have prior experience with a knife. Medical experience, or maybe even in a butcher shop, or something like that. (subdued music) - Hey, Sam. Hiya, Sam. You remember me Sergeant Abraham, Homicide? - Homicide? Man, I've known you for five years. You're Vice. You sure it's Homicide? - Yeah, scout's honor, Sam. Look, I'm trying to find the guy who did this hatchet job on Shirley Anderson. - If that's what you're trying to do, I'll give you all the help I can. That guy should be caught and put away. He's a weirdo. I mean, a real sickie. Besides, he's bad for business. Not to mention the trouble he's given to the help here. Hey, you guys want something to drink? - Yeah. - No. - Yeah, I knew the girl. She was in here last night. She gave me some money she wanted me to hold for her. - Ah, yeah. Trick money, huh? You get a cut out of that, Sam? - Man, I don't know what kind of money it was. She came in, gave me some money, I put it in an envelope. - You want a receipt, Sam? - Is he kidding? - All right, I'll tell you. Did you see the guy she left with? - No. She just came, gave me the money, and cut out with some dude. You know, Sherry and Anne were talking. Sherry's still here. She's the blonde at that table over there. Maybe you'd wanna talk to her. - Yeah. Maybe I'll do that, Sam. Evening. Are you Sherry? - Yeah. - I'm Sergeant Abraham. - I know what you are. - Mind if we sit down? - What is this a bust? - I'm trying to find the guy who got Shirley Anderson. - Yeah, I read about it in the morning paper. Terrific. Now we got something brand new, sacrificing prostitutes. - Yeah, let's just hope it's not an epidemic. You think this might be a pimp job? - Let me tell you something, flat foot. She didn't have a pimp or any old man, either. And another thing. I don't think she had to turn tricks for a living. It was different with her. It was the kicks, the laughs, all the different experiences. Hell, she liked it. - You don't? - You're damn right I don't. That is, most of the time I don't. - Sometimes you do? - Yeah, with the right guy. Not with any middle-aged trick like the one you just ran off. Besides, what the hell are you sitting on your asses for? You should be out catching her killer. That's what you're paid for. - That's just what I'm trying to do, sweetheart. I'm trying to find out who the guy was she left with. - Scary thing about it is, he could've picked me. That is, if it's the guy I saw her with last. - What do you remember about him? - Oh, he looked like all the rest of 'em. They all look the same to me. Well-dressed, middle-aged, lots of money. A pocket full of it. All hundreds. The only thing different was he had on this big gold ring. It was really unusual. - [Detective] What was unusual about it? - It was like a signet ring. Must've been custom made. I've never seen one like it. - What are you doing for dinner, Sherry? - Why, you buying? - I'm buying. (subdued music) - Frank, restrain yourself. Be nice. - Where are you going? (uptempo music) - Where's he going? - Ah, he's just gotta take care of a little business down the street, that's all. - [Waitress] Well, hi there, you nice people. What will it be? Breakfast, lunch, or dinner? - Dinner. How about a drink first? - I'd like a bottle of wine. Chateauneuf-du-Pape, 1970. - A bottle of Blue Nun for the lady. And chill the glasses. - [Waitress] Chill the glasses. Sarge. Sarge, Abraham. Don't you remember me? You worked with Bonnie, Sergeant. - Sure, Janice. I remember you. How are you doing? You were the most popular girl in town. What you doing waiting tables? I thought you'd be rich enough to buy a place like this by now. - No, I just work here. You know how it goes. I'm getting too old to compete with the pretty stuff. - I know what you mean. - Yeah, you girls sure got it tough. Too bad. - Well, I guess I'll go get the wine. - [Woman] Don't do it again, bitch. - Look, I'll do whatever I damn well please. - You're doing it again. - And you, you silly little bitch. - Excuse me. - I'll deal with you later. Knock it off. - You knock it off. It's the police. - What are you doing? - Thanks, pal. - Please, don't hurt 'em. I know them. Hey, they live in the same building I do. Please, don't hurt 'em. - Knock it off, man. It's just a family argument. - Come on, give 'em a break. - Is that what you want? - Don't run 'em in. I'll do anything you want. - Okay, get up. Okay, you three. Pay your bill, get lost. - Thanks. That's one I owe you. But get this straight. I owe you one, got it? One. - Well, thanks, sweetie, but you don't owe me anything. I couldn't have arrested those guys without a complaint. Janice ain't gonna sign a complaint, so forget it. But I accept. - Okay. - This one's on the house. Please, don't let it go to waste. - (laughs) Well, thank you, Janice. All right, there you go. Let's make this one to ships that will pass in the night. - Two ships. What's your name? I mean, your first name. - Frank. - To Fearless Frank the Fuzz.

Toast? - To you. - To you. - I've got a lot of money and I'm looking for a particular kind of girl. A very particular kind of girl. One that was... I don't know, you might say very evil. - Well, that's not me. I'm the plain Jane type. (man laughs) But I'll tell you what. We do have a girl here that you might be interested in. She's our feature attraction. But she is expensive. - Well, if she's what you say she is, she might be worth it. And just what do you mean by expensive? - Well, I've never been any good at arithmetic. Thank you for the drink and I'll send her over to you. I think you and her will get along just fine. - I'll wait. - What do you want, bitch? - Got a mark for you at the bar. He looks rich.

So this is where you want me here on the table, huh? You know, this reminds me of back in Baltimore. Except my friend there, he used to use these silk scarves, tie me to the bed. Of course, I don't know what kind of scene you got cooked up here with all your doodads on the wall, but whatever turns you on. - [Man] Yes. Yes. Yes. - Ah, hey. Don't be so rough. - [Man] Yes. Yes. - [Woman] That's the oil, huh? This is the part I always liked anyway. (uptempo music) - I'll go into the next room now and prepare for you. (dramatic flourish) Your hand.

You asked her to marry you? - No. - She asked you to marry her? - No. - You're the only one who's talking about marriage. - Nobody said anything, but I know broads. - You know broads? The only thing that's grating on you is that she's a prostitute. An ex-sergeant of Vice and a hooker. That's what I call a marriage made in heaven. But I feel sorry for her.

Yeah, the sergeant's with me right now. We'll be right there. - [Frank] Let's go. - So it's like I said. The fat's in the fire. All the top brass down at City Hall, every two-bit politician, the hotel association, they're calling me and they're saying, stop the bad publicity about the killings or you'll ruin Mardi Gras and cost us a lot of business. - Captain, we had 20 men out on the streets for three days and they can't turn up with anything. All we know is that this guy wears some kind of gold ring. Now, we don't even know if it's the same guy, we don't know if it's the same ring. Hell, I even stopped by St. Louis Cathedral to talk to a priest about sacrificial killings. He doesn't know anything. - Well, I haven't been exactly idle, you know. I've called the department heads at LSU and Tulane. Christ, I even called MIT. Nobody knows anything about sacrificial killings. - Captain, I think I found something. I called the professor at Duke University. You know, the weird one that deals in ESP and stuff? Well, he couldn't help me, but he gave us a name. The guy's right here in New Orleans. He deals with antiquity. You know, the old stuff that's happened in the past? His name's Dr. Lewis. He lives at 1020 Barracks Street. - Good. - Captain, you don't believe in all that ESP psychic stuff? - All I believe in is results. So let's get results of some kind. You, go talk to this man. - [Dr. Lewis] Yes, gentlemen. Your captain called me. I'll be glad to help you in any way I can. Please, sit down. - Thank you for your time this afternoon. Have a look at these, will you? - Human sacrifice. Not uncommon today. - In the United States? - Yes. The Indians in the Western culture do it and even in parts of China and Outer Mongolia. Human sacrifice, as part of a religious ceremony, is still practiced on a regular basis. As to human sacrifice, with the exception of devil worshipers like the Manson family in California, which, of course, received a great deal of publicity, human sacrifice is very difficult to discover. Very rarely found out. - Doc, wait. Start at the beginning. Why are there sacrifices? - Well, the sacrifice is to establish a link between the world of reality, our world, and the world we don't understand. The Aztecs called their god of the four directions Quatalique. They believed that he would bless them for the offerings of the red cactus fruit. Which, of course, would be the heart and its blood. The reason for the sacrifice and the offerings is so that the god will endow them with godly powers. It's not unusual even in Christianity. We have the sacrifice of the mass, the body, and the blood. The sacrifice is the giving of something that we value in return for something that we want. A favor. - I can't believe that this kind of stuff is still going on. - These two photographs are typical Aztec sacrificials. If I'm not mistaken, this is the same sacrificial rite as the one to Quatalique. Or as we refer to her in English, The Lady of the Serpent Skirt. - How can we find these people, or this person? - It will be next to impossible. As difficult as telling a Baptist from another Protestant. Or a Catholic from an Episcopalian. However, if this is a resurgent cult, it must be stopped immediately. It is, in my opinion, evidence of a serious sickness. - Yeah. Thank you for your time, Dr. Lewis. - [Dr. Lewis] Thank you, gentlemen. Call on me if you need me. Good luck.

He wants something special, so give him what he wants. (mouthing music) (ominous music) - Yes. Please, sit down. - [Sissy] Thank you. - Can I get you something? - Well, I'm kinda hungry. I haven't eaten yet today. - What would you like? Anything at all. What's your favorite food? - Chinese food. When I was young, my mother used to work for a Chinaman and he used to send home special packages on the holidays of his favorite Chinese dishes. Could I have some wine? - Yes. This is 620 Madison Street, apartment four. I would like you to deliver an order of shrimp rolls, lobster Cantonese, jia su ding. And a fortune cookie. Thank you. That will be here in about 15 minutes. In the meantime, wouldn't you like to freshen up? Take a shower? (knocking on door) - Somebody order Chinese food here? - Yes, how much is it? - 19.50. Thank you very much. Thank you. Bye. - That looks delicious. - I know you'll enjoy it. - You know, it was really nice of you to get this for me. Not many people do this in my business. Thank you. - Eat. - That was delicious. - [Man] I'm glad you enjoyed it. - Now, what can I do for you? - What do you do best? - I dance best. - Come. (subdued music) You're very beautiful. How old are you? - 19. - Please, leave. - I don't understand. Did I do something wrong? - Leave this place now. - Look, mister.

My God, help me. - [Man] And now your hand. The hand which accepted the money for your evil. (Sissy screaming) The foot that carried you to your evil. (Sissy screaming) - My God, help me! Help me! No, no! - And now, the part of you that completed your evil. (Sissy screaming) - What? He what? - Who was that? Sherry? What's the matter? - You took Shirley's money. You're just a no-good goddamn cop. Just no goddamned good. You cheat, you lie, you steal. And you get on me for being a hooker? You took the dead girl's money. You took it and you put it in your pocket. For Christ sakes, we all had to pitch in to bury her! You're just no goddamn good. - At least I ain't no hundred dollar a night hooker. A goddamn whore. - That's right, pig. You ain't worth no hundred dollars a night. If you were a broad, you'd be lucky if you could turn a $2 black trick. (Sherry screaming) That's what I expected from you. - Come on, Sherry. Come on now, quit. Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - Sorry, hell. That's it for you, buster.
