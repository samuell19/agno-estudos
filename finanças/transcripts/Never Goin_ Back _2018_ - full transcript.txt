Jessie. Jessie, wake up. Hmm. Jessie. - Get up. - Mmm. What time is it? Did I miss the alarm? No, no, we're good, we're good. But you have to get up now 'cause I have something really, really awesome to show you. Did you draw a dick on my face? - Uh-huh. - Gimme the pen! You think you're funny? I'm gonna draw a big, fat juicy dick on your face. - Where's the pen? - Fuck off, dude! - I have a surprise for you. - I don't believe you. Stay down. Right here! Get the fuck off me, dude! I have a surprise for you! - I don't believe you. - Get your butt off me. No, it's like the best fucking surprise ever. - Is it a big surprise? - The biggest. Get off. It's in Brandon's room. I'm gonna kill you if you woke me up for no reason. No, you're gonna love me so much, dude. Come on. Oh, my God! I can't believe your brother shares a room with this guy. I can't believe we share a house with the two of them. Touché. Wow, Brandon is such a per v. At least he watches girl on girl, though. Regular porn is like, so sad. Ugh! Oh, my God! - What? - Is she peeing? I don't know. There's, like, so much. I think so. That's a thing, though, golden showers. - Gross. No. - No? I'm not into it. Don't ever pee on me. I kinda actually have to pee right now, though. It's so far to the bathroom, dude. Okay! Ange, stop! Stop, okay? What do you wanna show me? Okay, close your eyes. Okay, you can open them. Oh, that's so pretty. Where is that? That, my dear, is where you will be turning 17 next week! - What? - Yeah. There was a deal on Hotpons, so I went ahead and bought it, and we are going to Galveston for your birthday. Surprise! Oh, my God! Are you serious? - Yeah. - Oh, my God! Look, look, look. Here's the condo we'll be staying at, and it has a pool and a hot tub. And look, it's right on the beach. Holy shit, Ange. This is so nice, but how? I mean... Where'd you get the money for this? Okay, so don't freak out. Um, I used our rent money. But I already talked to Roderick, and he gave us almost every shift this week, so we'll totally make enough before we leave. You used our rent money for this? A week before rent is due? Yeah, but, dude, we're working, okay? So, we'll totally make it back. I can't believe you didn't ask me about this. I wanted to surprise you, dude. Listen, Jessie. Your 16th birthday was shit. Okay? And you've been talking about going to the beach since I met you, and it's finally happening this week. Unless you just, like, absolutely don't wanna go. We still have two hours to get a refund. But I really don't think we should, dude. It's already paid for, and we already have the shifts. Look at this. Right? You deserve this. We deserve this. - Ten shifts each? - Straight money. So, do you wanna go? Okay, yes. I wanna go. Are you sure? Because I really want us to go. Yes, I'm sure. You know what? - We deserve this. - Uh-huh. We work our asses off. If we want to go to the beach, we're go in' to the fuckin' beach.

Be here in the morning. We will. Bitch. I'm gonna go with Ryan and make sure it goes down like it is supposed to. - Trust me, man. - I'm trying. But that's a lot of money we talk in' about here. Hey, my money's in this shit, too. - Yeah, and mine. - See? We're all in this together. From here on out, we're not just a bunch of dudes go in' in on a pound. I feel like...

Oh, and we'll hit you up from Ryan's phone, man. Your boy's almost outta minutes. How was work? Um... Shitty as usual. What was that about? Oh, let's just say that your big bro is about to make bank! Me and my boys go in' in on a pound, cheap as fuck. Wait, what? Dustin, come on. I thought that you quit dealing? What? I was waiting for the right business opportunity. And I gots it. Well, be careful, okay? Dealing's dangerous. We're gonna bounce now. Y'all gonna be up later? What's up? No, we're not, 'cause we actually have to work tomorrow. - So keep it down. - Sucks for y'all. Not when we're at the beach next week. Do what? What beach? - Galveston. - How'd y'all swing that? It's called a J-O-B. Gross. - Galveston's a piece of shit. - Fuck you! Why don't y'all go to Destin? It's not that much further. Well, we don't all have rich daddies to pay for our bougie-ass vacations to fuckin' Florida, okay? - Bougie! - Man, how many times I gotta tell y'all.

I just wanted you to know, in case you forgot, I share a room with your brother, and I really don't think you'd want him to see something like this, right here, on my computer. That's not me, dude.

Bye! - Jesus. - We live with idiots. These need to be washed, like, yesterday. Well, we can leave early, go by your favorite Laundromat. Fuck you. I wonder how many guys have to worry about their boxers being stolen by creepy perverts at the Laundromat? - None, I'm sure. - No, obviously not, and yet this is still real-life shit that we have to worry about when we wanna wash our clothes. It's not only gross, it's fucking expensive. When we get our own place, the only thing that I care about is having a washing machine. Uh-huh. When you turn 18 you should just, like, legally adopt me so we can go ahead and move out already. I'm like four months older than you, you goof. Plus, it's not like Dustin's gonna tell anyone. Like, you could just leave. Probably not, but either way, you cannot leave me alone here with these two, 'cause I will literally die. Jessie, I have told you, like, a hundred times, I'm not going anywhere without you, okay? When we move out, we move out together. Dolphies, dude. Dolphies. My God, we're gonna see real dolphins soon. Oh, I'm so excited. Are you happy? Happy? I'm obsessed with this trip. I can't stop thinking about it. I know. Me, too. It's gonna be the best time. Best birthday ever. - Hey. - Hmm. Rise and shine, little sleepyhead. What time is it? Time to get up for school. I don't wanna go to school. Well, you're in luck. You quit school and you work at a diner and you get to spend all day there. That sounds awful, too. It is, but... in five days, we're gonna be at the beach, - so that's something. - Hmm. Yo! Dustin! - Who is that? - Come on, fellas! Damn! Yo, ain't nobody here, dude. Somebody here. Where else they gonna be? Ain't got no damn job.

Good job! Chill! Wait, wait, wait! Come on, bro. Well, have fun picking this shit up! Let's get it. One, two, three! Fucking call Antique Roadshow. We got your fucking license plate, idiot! Hey, You better not call the cops! This shit's between me and Ryan, all right? The cops? No one wants that, bro! - Thank you! - We don't care! No one fucking cares! - It doesn't even fucking work! - Bye! Bye, have a nice day. Thank you. No, thank you! - Don't fucking come back! - Get the fuck outta here, bro! - Fuck you! - Fuck you! Fuck you, guys! Oh, God. Who called the cops? So, this Tony person. He's a friend of yours? I mean, yeah, I kinda know the guy. - Kinda? - We just hooked back up. I mean, I thought we were hitting it off. Hittin' it off? Are you homosexual, son? No. Not at all. Not that there's anything wrong with it. Well, is this Tony person a homosexual? I mean, do you have a problem with homosexuals? No! Well, I sure hope not. 'Cause I'm a homosexual. I sure hate being discriminated against. No, Officer, I swear. I love homo... ...sexual s. I'm not one, but if I was, I would be proud of my gayness. Love is love. - How 'bout you? - Me? No. I mean, not that I haven't had thoughts, sir, but I've never acted on them. I guess there was a thing with Benny Brewster... Do you know this Tony person? Hmm? No. Right. So, what you're saying is that someone you all know came over here at 7:00 a.m., knocked down your door, and stole your stuff, and none of you know why? Well, I mean, call me crazy, but by any chance, this have anything to do with drug money? - No. - No one here - does drugs, Officer. - Mmm-mmm. Then maybe you wouldn't mind if we took a look around? Assess the damages? Ah. Well, well. No, Officer, no one went back there, I promise you! Now, that is one big piece of glass. Now, what would two girls like you be do in' with such a big piece of glass? Ready, set, go! Did we just tie again? I can't believe we tied again. Jessie, you're so goddamn pretty. I love your hair. - I love your hair! - I love my hair, too. It smells so good. You wanna smell it? It smells so good! It was such a good idea to get that strawberry shampoo. Yeah, we have to get more. We still have some. Plenty, I think. When we run out, we have to get strawberry again. - You're so goddamn smart. - You're so smart, too. - Wanna make out? - Yes. Mmm.

No, that something would happen, because it always does. Jessie, this wasn't our fault. We had nothing to do with this. It doesn't matter whose fault it is.

Y'all remember the night before the robbery and all that? Well, me and my boys were fit tin' to go in on a pound together, and it did not go as planned. Yo, are you sure this is the right place? Yeah, man, I got the address right here. Maybe we should try knocking. All right, baby boy. You're gonna empty your pockets, you're gonna gimme all of your shit, and then you're gonna get the fuck off of this porch and out of the game. Got it? Holy shit, Dustin. You realize you could've been killed. I know, dude. It was some scary shit. Not that I'm glad that this happened, but you need to stop dealing and get a job. For sure. I mean, that's the plan. Right? Mmm-h mm. However-- It is gonna take us a minute to get our careers go in', so I might need to borrow a little for rent this month. Jesus Christ, Dustin. How much is a little? - All of it. - What? Are you serious? You used your rent money for this? Yo, that's how selling works, man. You gotta have money to make money. Guess what. We don't even have our own rent money. - So we can't help you. - Bullshit! Uh-uh. Y'all been working every day this week. I know you're roll in'. Talkin' 'bout beach trips and shit. Beach? What beach? I mean, just Galveston, but still. - Y'all can suck a dick. - Seriously. Dustin, I don't care how you do it, but you better come up with that money by the first or I don't even know what. Okay? Now, will you please take me home so I can use the goddamn bathroom? Move! Move! How hard is it to fill up a goddamn water jug, people? Do you wanna shower first, or should I? There's no fucking toilet paper. Here. No. Dustin, you need to go to the store. You need to replenish the toilet paper. Oh! You still ain't gone doo-doo? There's no fucking toilet paper! You don't need toilet paper. Just wash your butt in the shower. That's how I do. I did not need to know that. You're disgusting. Yeah, if we had any water! When did the water get turned off? - Oh, shit. - What? Did you not pay the bill? We already gave you the money for this month. Man, I forgot, dude. - I meant to call, for real. - Oh, God. Unbelievable. I hate this day. Me, too. I just wanna take a hot shower and put on some cozy clothes and sleep until Monday. I'd give almost anything to do that right now. I'm kinda starting to regret buying this trip. I'm really sorry all this is happening. What? Angela, hell no. Look, all of this shit is 100 % my brother's fault, okay? And whatever ends up happening, he has to deal with it. You and I are going on this trip, and we're gonna see some motherfuckin' dolphins, smoke some motherfuckin' ganja and eat some motherfuckin' dough nuts on the beach. Okay? - Okay. - Okay? Okay. - Come on, let's go. - No! No, man, we don't sell our own jeans. We steal them first, and then we sell those. Where the hell are we supposed to get $300 jeans? No, I'm good, man. Uh... Nordstrom's or Neiman's. - Neiman's? - What? I ain't stealing shit out of Neiman Marcus. All right, so you'll rob your best friend, but you won't steal from a department store? "Best friend." Number one, that was the first time I ever robbed anybody, - which I'm very sorry about. - We cool. Number two, look at me. I can let y'all borrow some clothes. He don't get it. Look, man, I'm a young black man. You could give me an Armani suit. If I walk into Neiman Marcus, they're gonna automatically think I'm stealing. You wouldn't understand. - Man, that ain't right. - It ain't right. - People need to get woke. - Get woke. All right. On the phone, you said you had "ideas." - That's one. - Man, we steal them, and then we sell them-- that's two. Seriously? What the fuck is he doing in our house? Yo, it wasn't my fault, man. We got robbed. Did you know that was his rent money? My money got ganked that night, too. I'm trying to fix this shit for all of us. Why don't you have your daddy send you some fucking money? Man, I already told you. He cut me off a long time ago. How do y'all not understand this shit? How the fuck are you paying for this juice then? Get your hands off my juice! Will everybody chill the fuck out? Please. - Daddy got this. - Oh, God. Me and my boys are makin' a plan right now, so get on! All right, so we need to decide on an excuse. I was thinking, since it worked so well last time... No. No. I know what you're gonna say and I'm not doing it. Come on. Like, a car accident is the best excuse. Dude, no, it's not. I almost lost a fucking tooth that time. Okay. I'm ready. No, no, no, no! Wait, wait, wait, wait! I'm scared. Okay, okay. - Just take a deep breath. - Okay. Close your eyes, okay? It's gonna be over so fast. Promise. - Okay. - Okay? Just don't hit my nose. I won't. - Promise? - Promise. Okay. Okay. We got so many sympathy tips. Because people thought we were, like, battered women, okay? It's not worth it. Why do your plans always have to require bodily harm? They don't always. Chicken pox? Ugh, they're biting me! I can't feel anything at all. Maybe they don't like my blood. It's on my face! Oh, my God! Goddamn. That was actually by far the worst. Really? Even worse than drinking that milk that time? Um, yeah. I mean, not that I like throwing up, but at least it was kind of easy. - Mmm-mmm. - Mmm-h mm. Roderick? Um, I think we have the stomach flu. We need to go home. You know, he wasn't even mad, just, like, genuinely concerned. He was kinda mad, though. He has such a good heart, that Roderick. Dude, are you okay? I'm good. I just need a minute. Jessie, look, you can't hold it in forever. Just run inside and use their bathroom. I can't, okay? It's already been too long. This is getting serious. It's been almost three days. Like, what if your intestines, like, explode, and then your whole body is poisoned and then you die? That's not a real thing, okay? Dude, you are literally full of shit right now! I swear to God, if you don't shut up... You know what you need, dude? Prunes. Come on. Dude, I'm serious. There's like nothing in this world that prunes can't fix. That's not true. Like, at all. One hundred percent true. Yes. Sample aisle. Prunes. I saw that, you little thief. What did you just call me? I'm buying these. Does he work here? Hell no, he doesn't work here. All right. Come on. Just walk away. Okay, let's go. Yeah? Mmm. No, come on. He's not worth it. - Fuck it. Hey! - Wait. Don't. Hey! Over here! Hi! Hope you're watching to make sure I don't steal anything. Oh, no, that's right, I'm buying these! You're not buying those nuts. That's theft! You stand over there and you eat and you eat. You know who pays for all that? Me! And all the other people who shop here when they raise the prices to cover for thieves like you! It's called sampling. I had like three nuts. And your little friend here, dressed like that. Have some decency! What? Dressed like what? It's, like, a thousand degrees outside. Like a whore. Like a thief and a whore. - What did you just call us? - You heard me. Go home! Put some clothes on! Whores, huh? Okay. Probably not the kind you like to fuck, though, right? Not quite young enough I bet, you fucking pedophile-looking jizz mop per. Fucking disgusting rent-a-cop wanna-be, Woody Allen-looking dick face. Fuck you, dude! We are leaving now, but only 'cause I can't spend another second looking at your dumb, hideous face and your oddly-shaped head, which is probably the closest thing to a penis on your disgusting, rotting, wilting body, you filth! Die! Get out of here! Bye! Dude! That was fucking crazy! You're such a bad ass! Dude, I know! What a motherfucker! Fuck! Fuck you! Wait, isn't that Paul's car? Oh, yeah. Wait, wait, come here. Dude, come on! He used to do this shit to me all the time when he worked with us. Me, too. I used to fucking hate it. Yeah. I can't believe that old fuck called me a whore. Dude, I know. Motherfucker! His poor wife. Did you see her? She almost had a heart attack. Yeah, I never know if I should, like, feel bad for women like that. Like, why would you be with someone so horrible? I don't know, dude. It's sad. When I see a couple like that, all I can think about is that at some point in her life, he had a boner and she let him put it in her. Eww! Why is that what you think about? I can't help it. Wait, wait. One, two, three. Oh, you fucking bitches! Why? Oh, my God! Finally! We fucking finally got you back! - No, that shit wasn't funny. - I'm sorry. I love you. Eww, no. One of y'all smell like shit. - It's our fucking uniforms. - Yeah. We have to work tonight, but we have to go to the Laundromat first, because clearly we smell like feces, so... Wait, wait, wait. Work? You're not hit tin' up Art Dog's party? Oh, shit.

We don't have to get fucked up. We can hang for a minute and say hey. Yeah. Hey! Hey! We have to wash our dresses. We can't. Just wash 'em at Art Dog's place. - He don't give a fuck. - Dude, yes. Or we could just go to the Laundromat. Maybe you'll see that guy that stole your underwear. You can ask for them back. Or maybe you can borrow a pair of his.

Dude, you should eat something. We should hit up Brandon for some sammies, figure this shit out. Shit. We're gonna have to tell him about this. Yeah, man. But who knows, maybe he can help us somehow. Like borrow some money from the register for a while, or, like, ask his boss for an advance or something. Hey, um, I'm tryin' to get down to Centerville and 31st.

I'm so proud of you, but that is never gonna work 'cause Brandon's just not gonna do that. Well, we can offer him something in return. Like a threesome, but we don't actually have to do it, because he's gonna be just as guilty as us. It is what he wants most in life. Yeah. Is that mean, though? Like, raising his hopes up and then just, you know, knocking them down like that? No, not at all, because technically, we're helping him not get evicted. Do you see what I'm saying?

Why wouldn't you tell me that? Yeah, that's what we were trying to do with the register money. Which is still a good idea, by the way. You said you needed bikinis, not rent money. There's not enough in there to cover it. - How much is there? - I don't know, like $50. I did the safe drop Before you guys got in here. Dude, what kind of broke-ass bikinis did you think we were gonna buy? - Wait, safe? What safe? - I don't know! The safe down there. I don't have a key.

I need to get some work done, and I prefer to do it alone. Okay. I'll just finish with the floors then. The floors look good. You can go. - But I... - I said go. Uh... Yes, sir. You can put the broom away first, Brandon. Of course. The broom that goes in the closet. The broom closet. Dude. - I almost had a heart attack. - Shut up. - See ya, sir. - Bye. Good-bye.
