Subtitles by Nostromo I feel certainly your daughter will like that one,Madam They are all so lovely I get confused I'm afraid,I'm afraid you're going to be rather impatient with me Not at all,Madam Perhaps,perhaps my daughter had better come in and select one for herself Is that convenient? -Of course,Madam -Thank you so much Thank you Taxi Mason Road,tube station,Southside Driver,driver I may need more time at tube station Right you are,Mrs Waterloo Station All right Right,Collins,all right What a shame? Look here,something in his hand Maddick born 1935 AD Maddick born 1935 AD That's a big help Collins wouldn't have died fighting for it,if it didn't mean something Of course not,it's means Maddick is a baby Born this year You're wasting your time in Scotland Yard,Hall Try writing for Punch Did it all right,you will look after them I hope you found the commissioner well He's on alarm.Why shouldn't he be? The first policeman murdered in five years The press are getting their heads off at him And over six MPs asking in the house tonight why we haven't caught Maddick To which we shall answer We'll sign every man possible to the case We'll keep on making arrest until the gang is broken up Arrests? We picked up a dozen men who had one conviction You can't hold a man for carrying a piece of paper in his pocket Not one of those knows anything more about it than we do The only way you'll ever find Maddick is by slipping a man into his gang That's a brilliant idea,Hall Specially after we lost three of our best informers that way And now Collins Does it means it can't be done? Simply shows that Maddick or someone probably had every man in the force for it What do you suggest? We send a troop of boy scouts after him? I got an idea Send those MPs who is going to ask the questions Nobody ever recognize them Look,there is nothing to stop us from getting one of the kids out of the police college They've never been on duty and nobody knows them You can't send boys on a man's errand I don't know,they are young but they've been trained Anyway we still have the problem how to slip a man into a gang This time it might be a good idea not to try Are you going in for comedy now? I mean we maybe we could fix it this time so that Maddick goes after our man By giving him a reference from the Yard I suppose No but if he pulled a job cleverer than anything Maddick's done Maddick might invite him in I wish we could think of something clever that Maddick hasn't thought of It ought to be something along the jewellery line That's Maddick's long suit I know a trick,let see how it goes The crooks find out the name of a wealthy man,who is out of town Then they go down to a prominent jewellers -How do you do -Good morning,Sir I'm Lord Metcalfe's secretary Yes,Sir,is something for yourself or for his Lordship?

Are you being funny? Not at all,I mean it Might be nice to be introduced to someone Once in a while Now it's being funny I work here and this is part of my job I am silly enough to be pleased When it doesn't show Except me to believe that? Why not? Well,I mean you're just a kid aren't you? What kind of job? Don't come here again that wheel is not on the level,nothing here is With the exception of you Wrong again Then what made you warn me I don't know,I've never done it before Let's call it my maternal instinct Oh I see Look here, if you feel like mothering me just a little longer -You can do me a real favour -Yes? You know where I can get rid of something? An object to worth and no questions asked You mean? You want to sell something? Well,not exactly I want to get some money for something And no questions asked? And no questions asked I see You are very logical aren't you? I work here and so naturally you suppose that I must know people who don't ask questions -No,no not so my dear I just meant that I -What is this object of worth? That's not by any chance from Monnier's? I said no questions asked -The jokes on me -Why? What's the matter? Oh,nothing,nothing Except that I thought You were on the level Well it only proves That you never can tell Yes I know somebody for you,wait here Another brandy,please Do you want to see me? No I didn't know,did I? Let's have a drink If you look carefully I got the hand in my pocket There's a gun in that hand I want you to pick your hat and coat All right,let's get out I got tired of America so I came home Then I nabbed those bracelets and you got one of them I hid the other two Anything else you're interested in? Have you ever heard of Maddick? I read the papers -Are you Maddick? -No but I'm speaking for him How do you like being blamed for my Monnier job? This is Maddick,Borden I've heard your story I can use you I am not interested,Maddick,I'm perfectly happy working by myself You can't work alone in London Who is going to stop me? You'll never pull another job I don't like competition And I don't like to be an errand boy for you or anybody else Why argue with him,Maddick? Let's get rid of him I'll make my own decisions as usual,Delaney Look her,Maddick,this light is absolutely ruining my eyes Why don't we drop this chamber of horrors,and let's talk it over That's impossible nobody ever sees me Well,what do you say? Well,that's how it is,what can I say I'm broke Then straight with me I'll make you a fortune Remember,once you are in, you'll never get out Alive -Seems simple -Not so simple Tomorrow morning you'll get a problem to work out All matters shall visibly at your disposal You'll have to make a plan Consider it a test That's all Wait a minute,Maddick, what about my bracelet That'll be taken care of All right,Delaney Take him to Mala's Morning sunshine did it ever occur to you to knock at doors? -You are new,ain't you? -Yes I'm new When you're working for Maddick you aren't supposed to do anything what calls for knocking -Maddick? -You wouldn't be here,if he wasn't What is this place,headquarters? No,he has got a dozen houses like this,for these people Morning,Delaney,you pay my hotel bill? I even got your clothes Come on hurry up,I've got the orders What is it for? One of our men in custody is passing counterfeit notes Now your job is to figure out some way of getting him out What? I admit I'm good but I never said I was a lawyer Well,it's all taken care of,for all it is You mean to say that Maddick has a solicitor in the gang? Do you think he is crazy? How? This is the legal work perhaps from another level They've never even heard of Maddick In other words I'm supposed to manufacture evidence that would even convince a solicitor And a barrister,I'll give his full name,Tommy Cain Here is his photographs Is that his regular job part of him done with?(?) No,Tommy is one of the best safe-cracker in the country -He is just got it blending the stuff -I see -Who is the solicitor? -AD Newall Has Maddick got a bookmaker working for him? Bookmaker? Yes,why? You tell me his name and I'll show you a trick Andy Purvis OK Good morning.What can I do for you? You can do something for Tommy Cain Who? Tommy Cain,he is one of your best clients,isn't he? Never heard of him Here is what he looks like Never saw him before Maybe Maddick was mistaken -Maddick? -Yeah Why didn't you say so in the first place? What's do you want me to do? First of all we to act rehearse than we go round to the solicitors What is your interest in this case,Mr Borden? Well,Tommy Cain is one of my best friends Then why didn't you bring this information to my attention before? Purvis only told me about it last night That's right,Sir I only put two and two together when I was talking to Pete here Since the case goes to trial tomorrow this must be put before counsel at once Now Mr Purvis Could you identify the notes you gave to the prisoner on the day of his arrest? Well,I couldn't exactly do that,Sir But I'm sure of two things One that I took a lot of counterfeit one pounds notes that day And the other that I paid Tommy Cain with 60 of them Have you ever received counterfeit notes on the race course before? Oh,yes,Sir Every bookmaker gets them We work so fast we haven't got time to examine every note we take Then if the prisoner says he received the notes from you you're prepared to say that it is possible Oh,yes,Sir Yes I see Now,Mr Purvis,the prosecuting counsel is bound to ask you this question When you receive these counterfeit notes in your bag,what do you do with them? I take them back to the course and hope that people that gave them to me get them back again In other words you offer these notes yourself knowing them to be forged The further comment is,Mr Purvis on such evidence that you should be in the dock instead of Cain Now look here Mr Addison I haven't got time to testify at the court tomorrow So if this is just the same to you I'd sooner let this thing drop And allow an innocent man to be punished,Mr Purvis There is no time for jokes,Purvis If you'll excuse me,Sir May I say something? Yes If a bookmaker find these counterfeit notes he can write them off as bad debt can't he? Yes Well,that's what Purvis does Some day that sense of humour of yours are going to get you into trouble,Andy I thought everybody realized I was only being funny I wouldn't pass that counterfeit notes Only by accident,of course,Sir -I don't think I know your name -Pete Borden Are you a friend of Cain? Yes,Sir I think I ought to remind you there is such a thing as carrying friendship too far Manufacturing evidence for instance I can assure everything you've heard is true,Sir It'd better be if you want me to conduct the defence Well,I think that's all gentlemen We can rely on Mr Purvis curbing his sense of humour When he gets into the witness box tomorrow -All right,Sir,I will Sir -All right,good morning Now you alter that point in the, you discussing.. See you later Wait a minute I've had my orders too,Borden, I've got to take you home You mean to say that you knew all about this My instructions were to do as you told me And see you get back the moment when it's over Damned clever this Maddick Hoy,taxi Good evening have you a double room to let? -One that faces this street? -Yes,will you come in? Thank you It's really accommodate three with an extra bed That's not necessary it is for these two gentlemen You get the morning sun in these windows My friend is deaf You couldn't do better than this boys All right,we'll take it Borden's idea worked,Maddick, they are acquitting Cain this morning The boy looks promising,I couldn't have planned it better myself Clancy,I want Borden on the Mead job Now take these instructions To meet a lady in Culver place tonight She'll be waiting in a black Daimler She has invitation to Lady Mead's reception We are after The Mead necklace Be careful Not to cause suspicion to fall on me Is that the lot? Is that the lot? Yes,he's left the window Let's go We can't allow him to get away with the Mead necklace I know but we'll endanger Borden's life if we keep grabbing Maddick's plan I'm perfectly aware of that but since we have this information,we got to act on it Possibly lose our chance of catching Maddick Now Maddick won't get suspicious if we follow the plan what I've suggested In addition we must have someone on the reception to observe what happens Well,if you insist but if we send plain-clothes men we're bound to show our hand All you want an observer isn't it? Anyone can do that That's it observer,Sybil Cable What about her? She writes a society check column in the Gazette the Observer She's bound to be there,knows everybody Would it satisfy you,if we didn't tell her too much and let her report to us? Well,it might Give me the Gazette,Sybil Caden Hello Oh,hello,Inspector Cardby what fun I haven't seen you for ages Miss Caden,will you be going to Mead reception tonight? Good Now I want to ask you to do us a favour Oh,rather Shall I come around? Rather I'll wait for you Which way is Arbony Street? All right,Borden -Hello,so it's you -So it is Well,nothing can be nicer, I've missed you Here is the invitation Can't this wait I'm actually fed up with business You know they kept me on the go ever since the night we met How do you like your new business connections? Not bad,not bad at all Well,the next gets on with polish All right,Count and Countess Andrea Messi -Is that us? -Naturally Oh my luck is certainly in, given a title and married to you You know,Maddick always said he'll make my fortune The light goes out exactly at 11 you are to stand at the door and see that no one comes in or goes out What fun do I use violence? You use your head By the time they get the lights on I'll be gone from then on your own about getting out -And the necklace will be gone when you are -Yes Of course we are married and everything is arranged Except how to keep out of jail if anything goes wrong Oh don't Why? What's the matter? Well,not nothing,nothing I'm sorry I didn't mean to frighten you I am not frightened Yes I am frightened I've got the feeling as if Some things is going wrong Oh,keep your chin up Maddick never missed a gem has he? I know,I suppose it's only nerves Of course it is When did it get you? You know I can't believe all this about Maddick Of what? Because somebody must know who he is What's it to you? Just curiosity Curiosities go more than ten Well,that leaves us just about where we were,doesn't it? If you quite finished with guessing games you might be interested to know about tonight Well? Our host don't know us but we are friend of friends of their.... Count and Countess Messi Buona sera Contessa,siete stato molto ... Oh dear I've forgotten the Italian first steps It is hardly necessary,Lady Mead, we both speak English Thanks,my Italian is awful and Lord Mead's simply doesn't exist Or worse But it is so kind of you to accept the invitation of a stranger We are all friends of Princess Rossi We are really a little angry with the Princess she ought to have told us,you know, that you are coming to London You must forgive her,we left unexpectedly Of course You enjoy yourself I'll try and come and look after you later on Thank you so much -Like to dance? -I'd love to -Can't we? -We have time Well we got over the first hurdle of the night,didn't we? Didn't we? -Aren't you speaking to be Countess? -Sorry You know I'm glad we didn't met the Fallis while we were away Yes,fine We'd had complaints from the tenants about the draft Now it's your turn you say It's not drafty Do you ever take anything seriously? Oh,yes,dancing for instance -You dance well -Thank you Madame You are not the exactly the white man's burden on your toe I'm beginning to feel better now It's the dancing Good for the nerves Mr Conway Addison What's the matter? Dance closely,Conway Addison is here Oh my dear Does he know you? Yes I've been in his chambers for my first assignment What shall we do? We don't have to do anything,keep our eyes open Miss Sybil Caden Did you know the Abigail's other cocktail party tonight you don't have to worry about me I know all about you I am a detective I got to keep my eyes open He said,so he told me,but it's quite enough I die for the dear old Scotland Yard This is terribly important They are making us looking entirely natural That is exactly what they said to me,entirely natural Aren't you worried about the necklace? Oh,darling there is nothing to worry about But promise you'd be careful Oh,I promise to my sacred heart Not a word,not a word to a soul,let me A real burglar Darling,I do wish you hadn't gone to the Abigails So do I,the Gully's people were there. Awful waste of time -Hello,people -Hello,Sybil Exciting party,isn't it? -Exciting? -Well it's going to be exciting Really? Has Margaret something up the sleeve? You are not getting a word out of me Good Evening Good Evening,I do not think I had the pleasure Isn't your name Borden? I'm sorry,Sir,Count Messi,my wife How do you do My name is Conway Addison, you must forgive me but it is the most astonishing likeness It is I who am sorry we have not met before -If you'll excuse me,Sir -Yes,of course Well,that's the second hurdle over Your Italian accent didn't sound any too convincing I think it worked Anyway not long until 11 o'clock How long? Three minutes We'll have to separate Right,au revoir Good luck Don't leave the room I'm so sorry,Madame,I was merely trying to avert of any Why shouldn't I go out? -But I really thought -I don't care what you thought Perhaps you'd better explain to Lady Mead,young man And the suddenly I felt a hand And the necklace was jerked away My Lady the lights were fused intentionally Sasha,that young man He has something to do with it,I am certain -Which young man? -There Madame is excited,Lady Mead I was merely trying to keep the people quiet You are being ridiculous,Sybil -Choosing Count Messi -Count Messi? Count Andrea Messi,Madam,at your service -You? You are Count Andrea Messi? -Most certainly Oh it's not true I know Andrea Messi this man is lying,he is not Andrea You thought he was someone else too,didn't you? Yes,I could have sworn he was Sybil you're excited be careful what you say Excited? I am not very excited that I can't remember my friends If you are Count Messi where is Eleonora? -Eleonora? -Your wife There you see he doesn't even know his wife's name I came to the police Conway I am glad you're here This is terribly embarrassing, what shall I do? I wanted to tell you,Herbert I mistook this gentleman for somebody else earlier in the evening You excuse me,Sir,but in view of the circumstances I shall have to ask you to wait until police arrive Of course,I too am anxious to have this mistake cleared up Just a moment,Sir,you won't have to wait you're quite right,Madam,this man is someone we've been looking for a long time I'm from Scotland Yard,come along Scotland Yard Yes,no worry about the necklace,My Lord We were kind of prepared for this Woman he came with exited,she is probably at Bind street by now -I see -I don't believe him You know,this is carrying things too far You knew Oh,yes but I'm sober enough now If you're from Scotland Yard,where are your credentials who are you? I'm Detective Sergeant Jackson He is not,he is lying,I happen to know they weren't sending anyone here tonight Ring up Scotland Yard and see We are followed Borden let's go over the window Stop him We separate here,there's a taxi round the corner There's one of ours it will take you home You mean Maddick was prepared for this? Why not? You got court order to ring up Newall at his house 18 York Don't talk to the cops talk to him -Newall the solicitor? -Right -Right All right,all right Where are my binocular Where are they? Investigate AD Newall Solicitor I'm sure he's mixed up with Maddick His initials A D may have reference to born 1935 AD Clue Might be Maddick himself What's the idea with the gun? Well I might have been followed Nervous jumpy by the way I don't like the way the things went tonight You don't like the way things went tonight You won't forget Maddick Of all the misses I ever seen I thought Maddick never missed It wasn't his fault the necklace turned out to be paste -What? -Yeah Someone must have tipped them off Lucky for you to come straight back here -Where else should I go? -Who knows Anyhow the orders are you're to stay as long as you hear from Maddick Is she trailed? What about Natasha, did she get away all right? Yes,she got away So you see gentlemen at one time or another each of you has appeared as counsel for members of the Maddick gang Without knowing it,of course Certainly And in each case you received instructions from Mr Newall Many cases in which convictions seemed certain where repeatedly upset by last minute evidence Now what we want to know is this Was there anything unprofessional in the cases Mr Newall brought to you? Absolutely no as far as I am concerned That's all there is to say,gentlemen My practice was failing,I needed money I accepted the retainer even though it came anonymously You mean to tell me you never knew the man who sent you this money? Didn't even know his name? The money was sent to me in cash Instructions to defend men who came to me from time to time And you never suspected that all those criminals you defended were members of the Maddick gang? I told you that apart from seeing Maddick's name in the newspapers I know nothing about him I hate repeating myself,Inspector If you doubt my words, you know what steps to take I take it you stand willing to turn over to us all your records and payments Every record in the office if you like O'Herne Just show these gentlemen to the waiting room and then come back I want you to get some papers from the files If it all safe for you I think it's better we'd stay in here I find my position quite humiliating enough without having to make good my word on the police supervision So ever if you wish to stay We'll wait outside I want the records of every criminal case we handled this year Yes,Sir You don't think he might be the old boy himself Not likely But he knows more than he's told us Is that all? Not quite,Sir Well,I wonder how much longer it's going to be We'll give him a few minutes more Seems a fair amount of stuff there More paperwork Oh,he's shot Mr Newall shot himself Used a silencer Dead Now what the pickle,the fire Stay right where you are,nobody must leave One hundred that's more than I've ever seen in my life at one time Maddick never let you down yet,has he? -Clancy -Just a minute Go on,get out Clancy Yes,Maddick The verdict on Newall is suicide Just paid off Ben I'm going to lay a trap for Borden Why waste time? Nothing ever went wrong until we took him on I want to be certain and I want to find out how he does it Now take these instructions Sorry about that Newall death Maddick still functioning Have orders For a hold up Oh,the countess come in I won't be so pleased to see anyone in my life -It sounds generous -It is Partly because I'm bored but chiefly because it is you -Don't say you come on business -No-Good As a matter of fact I'm taking a chance coming here Really? Well,it makes it all better Have a chair -And a drink,maybe? -I might-Good What's going on? Well,cheers Borden,why did you get into this? Into what? Into the gang -Why is any man a crook? -You are not I've seen enough of you now to know that my first impression was the right one Before you showed me the bracelet Oh,yeah There is something wrong about real crooks You get a feeling about them Like the feeling you have about snakes Oh,more feelings? You are not a real criminal Of course not,I merely work for Maddick because I'm bored with my mother the Duchess Some people get in because of circumstances And regret it I mean,you've been awfully in search of material And incidentally,there's nothing snaky about you my girl Circumstances? My father refugee,stranded in London after the revolution He told me to live when I was.. I was very young When I got old enough to protest it was too late because I was in with Maddick Nice man your father A weak man -Is he still with Maddick? -He's dead I see May I ask you where all this conversation is leading? Pete,I want to quit this I wanted to get away from Maddick for a long time I couldn't I was afraid You're the first person I'd ever met I can count on Come away before it is too late We'll help each other,we can make a go with somewhere else Not so fast,hadn't you'd better be careful that sort of talk might be fatal if it got to Merrick I know what I'm doing It won't come to Maddick through you My heart is an open book I suppose you can trust me on to death and all that Yes If that means anything to you Well,maybe I have a better nature But how do you propose to bring it out? I love my work What were you doing out there? You know,Maddick is going to be interested to hear the way you feel about Snakes Don't be a fool,Delaney I shouldn't tell Maddick something he already knows What's that? That was a trap born on Maddick's instructions As far as I'm concerned you're through it Hi,Delaney,I'm tired of having you following me around And if I report that you interfered with this assignment,you'll hear from Maddick Well,it seems to be that,isn't it? Not quite You know I should stay away from that girl if I was you Seems to be a sensible bit of advice,thanks Now you can do some for me,Delaney Yeah,I'd like to do,a little favour You'll do this,tell Maddick I got to see him at once,it's important,understand? What do you want to see him about? That's between Maddick and me Well,it should be easy,think Maddick wants to see you when I tell him about this William Hicks Hatton Gardens Three o'clock Mr Hicks -Yes -Detective Inspector Hall,New Scotland Yard -Scotland Yard? -Yes Mr Hicks, I trust we can rely on your discretion -Of course,Inspector -Good We had information,it's going to be a hold up here this afternoon -What? -In this case we are going to protect you without any police here But inspector,what will I do? Put your valuables in the safe Just before 3 o'clock two drunken men will start a fight in the street That detects them as our constables They got orders to protect you without appearing to But,why don't you just put a policeman in here? That'll tip the gang off that we got a piece of information -I understand but -There's nothing to worry about,Mr Hicks Carry on just as usual Hello Clancy? This is William, a Scotland Yard man was just here All right,William,stay there until it blows over Maddick Borden squealed All right,Borden,what is it? Why do we have to go through all this light business again,Maddick? -Can't I see you now? -No,come to the point Well,if you insist I'm tired of the way things been going wrong lately What do you mean to do about it? I've got an idea for a big killing But after what's happened I'll trust nobody but you Well,what is it? I'll tell you it in person,Maddick I don't see people in person What is it? It's the Camden Loan Society They've got a hundred thousands in cold cash in a safe a baby could open How do you know about this? I've found it before I joined up with you It is enough to retire on there if we keep it between ourselves It sounds interesting, Borden,I'll look it up If it is what you say I'll see you,after the job That's all That's our man,boys,he's the one who's been tipping the police -Maddick -Go on Did you ever send Natasha to test Borden? No,why? She's with him,I caught her yesterday making him a proposition to abandon us She said it was on your orders It wasn't Well,we can take care of her too First of all I want to tell you that Borden is not to be touched He's the best protection we ever had I'm going to make him think I'm taking up this job of his So he can tip the Yard on it That'll keep them busy while we'll pull the biggest stroke we've ever undertaken and we can't miss The instructions are as follows I persuaded Maddick to attempt Camden Loan Society job as planned Job to take place at 4 o'clock This afternoon Maddick Promises to see me if it is successful Maddick promises to see me if it is successful So there must be no interference I am to be at the Loan Society Office at 4 sharp with the girl After the job a man will pick me up in a green car and take me to unnamed place to meet Maddick Well,now,that's what I call getting result I'll wait until I see Maddick behind bars That's very promising,very We must have Borden followed at any cost Both to protect him and to make sure of Maddick ,Cardby You take charge of the arrangements at the Loan Society Office Right Paul,come in Took with me,Clancy You've met before but you don't know it Hello,Borden Of course,the voice in the dark,sit down Thanks,we've go to get started Oh,no,my order said that Natasha would call for me That's been changed,you and I are going together now Delaney will wait for Natasha All right But I hate to leave this I think I would have won Don't you worry I'll finish the game for you -Oh,I wouldn't trouble -No trouble Fertile(?) I assure you Yes,I believe he would have won Well,why do we stop here? Ever hear of the Maharajah of Patulla? I've seen his name in the papers,why? We've found he's arrived in London this morning At least with half a million pounds in diamonds Maddick wants them What about the Loan Society job? Next,that's all right We'll pick that up tomorrow I see Well,what do we do? Practically nothing We are only atmosphere, Webb does it all The help with the boys over there What time is it? Four You know Borden,the old man has taken a quite an interest in you He liked that Loan Society idea so much He wants us to talk to you after we pulled this one Today? So he says If everything goes off all right -Here they come -Take it easy Come on,get out of the car Well,where do we go from here? We are going to meet Maddick Where's Pete? He got his way to the Withies That's where I'm taking you To the Withies,why? We're going to Maddick there They are going to meet Maddick At the Withies What's the Withies? Why should Maddick be meeting us? I don't know Probably to celebrate catching a policeman in the gang A policeman,who? Why? Borden of course Rather good,you were trying to make him give up the life of crime That's not true,it can't be All right See for yourself,come on Well,if Borden is a policeman, why does Maddick let What live? That will be attended to Don't worry,I expect you'll see him in time to kiss him good bye -Funny isn't it? -Yes,very Especially,when you remember you had the final in life with him After that heavy sob story of yours Awfully funny Taking him to the Withies? What's the Withies? All right keep your eye on that room and report anything further that happens Yes Something went wrong Borden didn't turn up at the Loan Society nor did the girl Nobody did Yes,what? They did? All right,I'll call you back The Maharajah Patulla's jewels They hold up the van and got away with it That's the answer,they used the Loan Society idea to trick us Yes and now they are taking Borden to somewhere called the Withies to meet Maddick What's the Withies? Withies? Withies is a willow particularly the osier willow Likely the name of some country house Well,whatever it is, we'd got to find it Don't you see what this means if they want Borden they'll kill him Stop him,stop him,he'll get away -Hear now,what's going on here? -Never mind now Notify Scotland Yard,he's going to the Withies a country house in Sussex,quick They got to work Clancy,take him into the room on the right Clancy,see if Borden's got a gun Borden Open the door go into the corridor, open the first door on your right For the rest of you,stay where you are Go ahead Clancy When Natasha comes,let me know Maddick Addison Or Maddick Whichever you prefer I congratulate you,Borden,you're the only person who knows my identity And certainly the only policeman -Policeman? -Yes Tell me,how did you communicate with the Yard? You don't expect me to tell you that,do you? Yes,I do rather You see I'm going to kill you,Borden But I'll wait until my curiosity is satisfied Of course if you choose I don't see to have much choice,do I? Sit down -Know the Withies? -That old house?-Yes How far? You've a good eight miles, Sir,it's hard to find Hop in My deaf man simply read my lips Very ingenious Very ingenious indeed If you're Maddick,why did you help trip me up at the Mead reception? That was simple I wasn't Maddick then,I was Conway Addison I had to act the part Very thorough,weren't you? I owe my success to it Tell me what Maddick born 1935 AD means Don't you know? I was going to ask you that? That's the cleverest clue I ever left I don't understand it myself Well,are there any more questions? Unless you tell me why you came into this? I was bored,my dear fellow I grew so tired of defending dull people accused of crime which was always the same So I decided,quite logically, to make life more interesting By committing exciting crimes in an exciting way It was fascinating Like playing chess with Life and death Of course,you think I'm mad,don't you? What else can I think? I prefer to call it Genius After all,dividing line is very thin,isn't it? If it weren't genius I couldn't kill you when Or the others in there With as little compunction as I'm going to feel So you are going to kill the others too? Yes,it suits my plans I want to retire and I wish to leave no possible trace -Yes -Maddick Delaney is here Natasha has gone to the police They might be here in a minute Keep calm and stay where you are -Natasha -Where is Borden? Is he here? -Police? -No,I'm alone Where is Pete? Where is he? I wouldn't dream of spoiling the last few moments of your little romance,old chap -Go and join her -What? Oh yes,go ahead Oh,Pete I'm so glad Let me,he's going to kill the lot of you You're lying,trying to get out of it It's locked Borden is right,it's very deplorable,gentlemen This is the only way out for me However you'll find death painless All over in a few minutes We'll be saved the police are on the way You hear that Addison, you can't get away with it Oh,yes I can I'm in a safe place There's a chap with me who's been here since Cromwell was hunting royalists Nobody ever found him And nobody will ever find me -Gas -It is gas I'm going take a chance at you Maddick -Just once -Of course you would But you won't and it's absolutely no use you drawing that gun,Clancy Drawing a gun? -Clancy,he can see us -What do you mean? -Well,that he can't see through walls -He must be It's walled in Here's a trick mirror Natasha Natasha Addison,get them out all quick It's gas,it's gas boys, come on and get them out Put them men in that car Borden Borden Pete I've just thought Holborn 1935 My telephone number Perhaps that was the clue So that was AD meant Addison All right,boys,take him away Natasha Oh,Pete,I want to say good bye to you And tell you I'm glad I was right about you Whatever happens to me But there's nothing going to happen to you Quite with you who made all this possible I'm sorry,Borden,but she'll have to go with the rest Come on I'm going with her and I'll get her on if it takes the rest of my life It probably won't Well,what are you waiting for Subtitles by Nostromo
