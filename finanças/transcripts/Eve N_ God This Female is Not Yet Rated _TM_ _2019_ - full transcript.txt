Yeah. No. Yes. Yes. Goddammit! No, no, no, no, no! Damn it! Hello? Where did all this come from? I'm addressing you, young lady. What the hell are you up to? Swivel. - Swivel? - No. Swivel that thing back in the picture. No. - Picture! - No. - "No"? - Yeah. No. Okay, I'll get there. I got it. Let's see. You... You wanna start over? Ha! You wanna go back to the beginning? Which one? Games, games, games. I bust my ass getting ready for today, and you wanna play games? That's right. Happy birthday to me. Oh, you wanna play? Today you wanna play? I don't know. I feel like, um... I feel like water. Two hours, missy. Two hours. And you're gonna have your PhD candy. I could have chose someone else. But I chose you. And today is the day... And you wanna play. You wanna play games. Your clock's got no arms. Anyway, it's gonna be sunshowers today. Give it up. It's that kind of day. And today is the day you wanna play a game? I dare you. Dare me. I think I just did. - Okay, but... - What? You know the consequences. I know the consequences. Okay. Let's go. Stage one. Let's go. You got a cause, lady rebel? Don't need a cause. But I got cause. Mister, you're gonna see some tasty action walking. You think you're my equal already. You gotta earn it. We gotta talk. I'm late. This door is swollen again. God, you make my teeth hurt. You make my teeth hurt. You said we weren't gonna get personal. Personal as it gets, buddy. Is this about, uh... when you were 16? I mean, how the hell was I supposed to know you were 16. Nobody reads for a PhD at 16. I've never been 16. This is about, where did I put my fucking keys? So? You know everything. Where did I put my fucking keys? Act like God. Why don't you act like God? Is this about Adam? Adam who can't find his own face with a mirror? That Adam? No, that would be for you, my dear. Narcissist princess. We don't play like that now. New rules. Yeah, you don't have any rules. Rules rule. Listen, I want out. Out this cat-birdcage. I thought you loved Adam? You don't love him. I do love him enough to get us free. Look, I wanna fly. Like when you found me. Free. You're a better lay, by the way. Too much information. Ah! Don't you get it? I came here for peace and quiet, not this. And the one reason, the one reason I agreed to be your adviser, you were the best in the department. Now, what happened last night? You're making a fool out of me. No, I'll make you a better man, God. Arrogance. Yeah, it's called swagger. I got me some swagger last night. Yeah, it's called swagger. I mean... Swagger. I got me some swagger last night. That's what happened. Right. Eve. Lili? Ha! I don't wanna retire with this on my hands. I had a good career. Respectable. Why? What have I done to deserve this from you? You saw me coming. My thesis had legs. Boots. Not fuzzy slippers. What happened? What happened? What happened? What happened? You! Ow! Ow! Every corner of that bitch ass prison mind-fuck university of yours. You shrunk my head. I see. I see you're diving in dumpsters again for new words. Well, listen here. Off the wall, hysterias for some punk trash, needle-happy hooker's not how I'm gonna spend my day. Okay, honey? Once a tramp, always a tramp. Jesus! God damn it! How could you? How could you? You promised. You promised. You promised. - I'm sorry. - You promised. You promised. You promised. You have no idea how I am. Eve. Lili. I'm... Shame. Shame. That's your favorite weapon. But you explain to me what happened last night. I mean, here you were doing a victory dance. You were ready, girl. You got it. Get through today's oral exam, and you were in the club. You locked me in again. I'm an asshole. You know I'm just some runaway imagination with a scholarship. But I'm doing the work. I could have wrapped this PhD in six months. Now I'm agoraphobia out there, I'm claustrophobia there. So happy birthday to me, I'm right back where I started before you showed up. Ow! What is it you exactly know? This piece breaks new ground for gender studies. Fuck that. We're people. Human beings. We are not our genders, Dr. Goddard. But we die for them. Uganda, Russia, Balkans, the Middle East, India. For Christ sakes, Corpus Christi, Texas, that girl, she was shot for kissing a girl. Killed for kissing. You can't blame me for everything, Eve. I have a reputation, a following, a lifetime of people to defend. I'm doing the defending today. What exactly are you defending on my time? Well, my entire existence. And well. Yeah, well. There you have it. I don't wanna die any more than you do. Some Greek tragedy. It's okay if I do. My ideas do die on your divine order. Something along those lines. Or fines. Look, nobody wants to kill you, for fuck's sake. I don't matter. I wanna play. You are already. What's the point of PhD if I don't get to play? No, no, no, no, no. But your game, it's rigged. Oh, listen. You hear that? It's the rhythm. It's the drum circle. I keep hearing them. Keep hearing them out there. And where am I? In here, defending your existence. Right. Right. I'm not Adam, so I don't owe you shit. Would you have me, right before my retirement, after all these years, throw everything away because you, in the arrogance of youth, you wanna make a point? A point? So I am a pale replica. Bleed 'em and breed 'em, right? Well, I bleed, but I will not breed for you. First, "pale replica"? Impossible. There can never be two of you. Second, are you on drugs? Third, give me some. I refuse to be domesticated, and still, you married me off to your spawn. Marry you off? Come on. What the fuck, Doc? Throw me some PhD before I throw you some babies. What the fuck, Doc? Grandkids. That'd be nice. Don't expect any babysitting. No. Look, nitwit, believe it or not, I, uh... I really... I'm the sacrifice, right? Disposable, like a razor. Like an extra in some movie. Volcanoes and virgins, burning women at the stake. Witches. And you are way out of line. Women. The burning of women at the stake. Out of line? This is my epiphany, not yours. I'm living on the corner of panic and ecstasy here. There is no line I will not cross. You know, it's not uncommon to experience fear and nervousness right before an oral exam. But who knew you'd crack up like this, huh? I mean, it's very likely we're on the onset of schizophrenia. Hilarious. PhD in birds, chicks, bitches, hysterics, and hoes. You are the peacock of the species. Often photographed, rarely seen. Ooh! Feisty schizophrenia. So much fun. Two for the price of one. More than two of me now. And we have no desire to behave. All of this happening last night? What happened? The rhythm, I guess. And I was wild. Who asked you for Adam? The guy's a mess. Gambling debts by day, and every night another back alley hedge fund. Dude, I am stripping for tuition here. What were you thinking? You knew I'd wake up one night and... And? And? I kissed a girl. I kissed a girl. I kissed a girl. Okay? Okay? Okay? And? And... And... Crashed my fucking hard drive. No big deal. It's only natural. It wasn't natural for me. It was good. Unnaturally good. Supernaturally not Adam. And as my findings reflected, not natural for the global girl, who is also asking for not Adam. Why? My data was clear as day. She never got the choice. What happened? You kept me in the dark. So, happy birthday to me. There will be no Academy Award consideration for your appearance before the PhD Committee, Ms. Lili. The data. The data was all everywhere. Road rage, sexual experimentation. Shameless swagger. We never had the choice to tell everybody to fuck off before. You guys are right. It is good to be king. So that's it? That's... That's all, huh? God! Hey, Big Bad. You remember how you lost your virginity? Well, I don't. It was shameful. Shameful? Honey, I cooked for you afterwards. - Oh, honey... - You did what you did. Don't you see? It could have been mine. Puberty, that's just for teenage boys, right? They will be boys. It's biological. Biology? Yes, biology. Finally, the global girl has evolved into a teenage boy. Now, take it easy. You're starting to worry me. Biology better grow a set, or it's back to the dark ages, baby. And whose biology is it, anyway? I maintain there are two and more than two biologies at play here. Well, overreaching, bordering on imaginary. Imaginary? It is so on. Yes That's all. God! Filibuster with a scalpel, Dr. Goddard. Cold, hard clinical laboratory evidence, supported by mainstream multimedia. Reflecting the collective consciousness of a culture screaming itself to sleep from a marriage crib on fire since the '60s. What is it now? 50% plus divorce rate? 40% first marriage. 60% second marriage. 73% third marriage. And fourth, and fifth, and, uh, tenth, sir. Ah, well, that's only for the gods. And goddesses. Oh, yes, the goddesses. It's the most dangerous thought you can think. So you sweep it under the carpet. It seems to me you're the only one near the carpet, sweetheart. Look, you told me... I told you I was correlating. Correlating. Mainstream media imagery with the restlessness in the marriage culture. Correlating. Solid avenues and goddamn Champs Elysees boulevards. Whoa, now look... Evolutionary for over six billion genders. Look, it's PhD. We are not curing cancer. Why not? What are you waiting for? Grow more flowers. Nine-million Jews, gypsies, homosexuals, 20 million Russians. Cambodia, Rwanda, Uganda, Mother Africa, and cancer? Really? Really? The arrogance, the arrogance of youth. I wear my tattoos on the inside. Why do your doors ever lock? I'm talking about a different kind of cancer here. Again, no credibility, no evidence. Eve, evidence. It's for the girls, Doc. We may not stone 'em, but we stone-cold ignore 'em. Mothers killing daughters killing sisters. Happens to the boys, too. If the boys are more in touch with the essence, the something, the nothing. The rhythm maybe. I don't know, you know. Well, that's... That's very touching, Eve. Very touching. But we have business here. You see, you are the girl in question who has an opportunity to empower herself with a goddamn PhD, for which you have worked. PhD? Then what? Tricks on Wall Street? Today. This knowledge belongs to every gender. Viral, spiral litmus test for the conditions of the waters of the world. All right Eve, where are you going with this? I mean, I told you over a year ago that it's crucial to maintain healthy habits before the oral. Now, we all deal with our fears differently, but, Eve, you are afraid. Grown ass man climbing up into my room. The fluid female, bisexual or try anything. She's the answer in you, Doc. She was born from danger and desire, lives in sin on a street with no regret. Eve, I want you to eat something. 78% of this planet is wet. Your astronauts know it. Every time I went there... Look, in my defense... You know how much I needed your approval. The only think I would have been defending today is you. I know that. Gender studies are not exact science. Exactly! That is exactly why you need me. My thinking. The arrogance! You're so arrogant. Look... When every living being on this planet loves every other living being without devouring it, then it will be an exact science. What? I was protecting you. From what? From knowing? It's not all it's cracked up to be, Eve. Knowing? Knowing's not all it's cracked up to be? Forgive my arrogance, but that is something I do get to choose, don't I? Doc? Don't I? Oh, God! Do you... Do you think I put my office in a corner because I was shy? Oh, God! I mean... Hell no. Oh, God! Knowing? Knowing's not all it's cracked up to be? I pretty much fuck anything. Look, I have pretty much fucked everything. Protecting me? From knowing? Protecting me from knowing? There's a time, missy... There comes a time when it starts to catch up with you. Look, do you really need every man on earth so see you as a sexual and economic rival? I mean, do you honestly? Do you know what these motherfuckers do to get up that ladder? To see you, no doubt. And your corner office. No doubt. So, Adam the bastard, he gets to know? I never told him to be a sheep. That is embarrassing. In my image, not sheep. You told him to be a sheep. - I did not. - Did too. Your turn. Well, it's no big deal. Apparently you don't need a PhD. Hell yeah, I'm getting a PhD. I can't be surf dancing my ass forever. Now you're acting like kindergarten. With your titties, and your bibetts, and your bows. We all know you're scared of sex. I am not afraid of sex. I'm afraid of you. Now, who's "we"? We the peeps. I told you. I'm beyond the birdcage now. Oh, yeah. More than I am. I hear it all the time. Up in your white ivory tower. Up in here, up in here. Dude, you should totally be tweeting. If I could get half your followers... I didn't know you like rap. It's amazing. Something you didn't know. You know, I have no idea where I picked that up. Hmm. Dude, why would I leave the sex out? I mean, is it pleasure? Is that why you're tripping? No. It's desire in girls, right? All that writhing and slithering. Jesus... Here's to the bis and tris. They hold the key to the tree. You kissed one girl. Girls will be girls. There's a reason we've gone wild. Every homo sapiens is a... Homo homie. What if we could end the war games? Of course. All showering together. All that Adonis blood coursing through their veins. Rockstars from Mars and their legitimate rape fantasies. Turns them on when she's got no choice. May it please the court, what is a man's man, but a man who wants another man. Love thy neighbor, and polygamy is okay. But a girl shall seek no wife? Why, Eve? I don't know, Doc. Burn down that log cabin, blow the whistle on the cultural industrial complex built for the one percent. Ceiling's too low. I can't afford to stay locked in here, and I can't afford to go out there, not in that marketplace. I'm warned you, Eve. Eleventh hour thesis revisions based on pajama party, girls gone wild, experiments into bio-curiosity, and evidence collected from kissing a girl for the first time. I mean, maybe you liked it because it was new. Maybe you liked it because there wasn't stubble. Or maybe... Maybe you're playing for the other team, you just want to have the uniform. Or you're playing for both sides. Yeah, like I won't declare a major. Therefore, you are the most dangerous. The most. Most dangerous gender bending weapon the state has ever known. Quite possibly. So better boardrooms, better bedrooms is dangerous? Okay. I wanna be dangerous. You've lost your marbles. You keep pushing this birth control abortion, and we might do 90% of the plant kingdom is bisexual. Papaya in the morning. Hibiscus in the afternoon. Orchids, orchids. All night long. Where's the visual aids? The uh... The charts, the graph? So glad we're finally having a talk. What about the conclusion? When you come down the upside, I don't really need your PhD, I just want it. Why not? - Why what? - Why would you give that up? - What up? - Are you playing with me? Yeah, Doc. Why don't you play with me anymore? Why, Eve, huh? To spite me? Is that it? To make me wrong? To embarrass me in front of the committee? Is that it? Hmm? My star pupil, my protegee. Why? For me. - You? - Me. Hmm. Did you know, the word "lingerie" comes from lingere? Which comes from licking, which... You get the picture. But we must get that other word from cunning... Cun... ning. And we know what a compliment that is. You know I don't like that kind of talk. That's enough, Eve. It's obvious you were never breast fed. Wow. Neither was Adam. Are you laughing at me? This has gone far enough. I'm only teasing you. Evie, Evie... What happened? You were so intelligent, so capable. There comes a point, too much intelligence can backfire. And then you just go... You just go stupid. Oh, there it is. Now I'm stupid. Yes, yes! Every syllable. Every consonant, every vowel, every phrase, everything. Everything that comes out of that syphilitic hole of yours. You stupid, stupid, stupid little girl. What a waste of time, to make a stupid fucking point. And why? Because boo-hoo, Mommy don't want me, Daddy's abusive? Yeah, so what? So what, your daddy... Your daddy was a bastard. Well, so what? I got a department to run. And you, little girl, you, I pay your bills. You hear me? You live off of me. And then you come to me with a chick flick topic about housewives who are bored and horny? Get out of my life. Get the fuck out of my life. You're just like every other whore. Stop it! Every one of them, every other whore. - Stop it! Stop it! - Every one of them, every other whore. - Every one of them, every other whore. - Stop it! - Stop it! - Every one of them, every other whore. Every one of them, every other whore. Stop it! Stop! You, Doctor, are afraid. Your medicine is violence. Scared to death of the little death to which you die to me. All this from some needle jockey, who finally found her pussy. Well... Oh, with 10 divorces you give me this sermon? Well, it's all the same, isn't it? Every one of you, "Pay my bills. "Pay my bills until I betray you." You always did weave yourself an angry sky. Turned your progeny against you, poison. I pay my own bills, and Adam's, too. With these, and these. I'm a broken heart locked up inside this rib cage. Keep it up. Fighting my own body. I can't see me in the mirror. Whole department envying my closeness with you. Keep me from knowing? Protect me? Deceptive me? Cunning me? Snake-like me? Conclusions, Ms. Lili. Conclusions. There is no conclusion. That's my conclusion. No right answer. No ending. We're in the beginning. Cop out. That's weak. You would learn from the gray zone, Doc. Not everything's black and white. It's all gray. And beyond the gray, it's a rainbow. I like how you said it. Titties and rainbows. Oh, titties and rainbows. Evidence, Eve. Each of us gender free multi-sexuals. Each of us re-defining gender with each and every choice. Titties and rainbows. The Nazi Party and their ass clones with their war on women. Their Hitler created order. Order of the pink triangles. The yellow triangles. And the black triangles. Those were for the witches. The women who dared to use contraception. Non-breeders. They called them work-shy. They wanted them working, their women. And the women who dared to love other women, and the sex workers, who dared to love anybody. Women with choice. Maybe they kept their strippers in a birdcage, too. Don't you see? It has to be re-written. If the individual dies, with no choice, then everything dies. Including you. I don't want you to die! I don't want you to die. Bubblegum! Equation. Polymorphous dimensions swallowing their own tails. Spiraling into ever multiplying... Ridiculous. ...infinity. Evidence. A third gender. In fact, over six billion. Crawling, cruising, choosing each other. Choosing themselves. I'm just about to end this conference. No, you're not. And why not? Because you need me. Even if I don't have his baby. It's delusional. You really do need the drugs. Oh! You hear it? You hear it? As many positions and preferences, flowers in every field swaying under ever ocean, clinging onto every rock, swinging from every one of Darwin's trees, plucking out of every garden, and every crack, every sidewalk, every thought, in every mind. Straight up dog shit. No ice. You could not be more out on a limb, Eve. You're in a dark place. Maybe the dark ages aren't over yet, Doc. But it's too late to flip the switch. I know. You know what? I know. You're bluffing. Mitochondrial Eve. Asia, Africa, Europe. The one mother. I saw her. Well, her DNA. Under a microscope. The mother of all mothers. You're a liar. I knew that you, too, would lie. She's beautiful. A beautiful mess. All right, I'm hanging up. - No, you're not. - Watch me. You want my evidence. You need my evidence. You're simply dying to live again. Oh, Eve. You're killing me. You wanna know what I know, so you can be free, too. Again, I warned you. Oh, what size do you want your crucifix? Don't need one. You've already assassinated my charter. But she's making a comeback. Oh, yeah. You hate me. I warned you. Like you warned Lila? Lilith? Lilith? What makes you... You saw her? She calls herself Lila. She could have gone to college, too. But she was older. Not a breeder, right? That girl is psychotic. She is abusive, she is crazy. That witch should be locked up. Locked up! Or burned at the stake, all because she wanted to be on top? And we all know, only you get to be on top. That bitch. Petty as a coin toss, but your bigotry is noted. I've played My Fair Lady to your Higgins, because I don't need to be on top. Never! She was disruptive. Wild, butch. Doc, I just wanted to learn. Don't... And I loved you so much. So ashamed. You threw me out like rotten fruit. I never wanted Adam. What I wanted was you. You called me your cat-bird. And I never looked back. I gave him to you. You gave me to him for breeding! It wasn't right for me to keep you. What's right? I'm old, damn it! I'm just a mutation. I could define birth as a rejection by the egg's immune system to the invasion of sperm. I'm too old for you, Eve. If you were my age I'd be too old for you. Yes, it might be some kind of Pygmalion Complex. But I tell you, I cried like a baby when I gave you to him. When I gave him to you. You were more than anybody else in that department. I wanted it for you. I wanted PhD for you. So you could just show 'em. Did you make a bet with the sheep? The committee? That you could take a teenage needle fairy and turn her into PhD? Stop. You gave me to him. I gave him to you, because he was young. You never gave me to myself. I never prevented you. You're everywhere. It's always arranged. Nobody tells... Nobody tells the girls if we catch that bouquet that might be the last choice we ever get to make. There are better men than Adam, Eve. Worse if he's a better man. You can't even blame the bum. Anyway, it's not his fault. It's the sheep. You hear it, Doc? You hear it? After Adam, I couldn't even see myself in the mirror. That doesn't have to be true. Oh, but it is. You had your work. Play. Play makes free. Play! I can't understand you. Honey... I'm worried about you. Doc, please. I want to play. Put me back in the game. I don't know what to say. More than one employer asking me, why do I need a job? Why do I need a job when I got Adam? That was your responsibility. You know it's hard on a woman. Pigeons for scraps, my friend. I hear the gossip. I'm slut walking. Well, I did the work. What did he do, except grow some penis? It's like some archaic, like... Like I'm some... Like I'm some snake in the grass. Like... I'm Delilah. I'm Jezebel. I'm Mary Magdalene. I... I'm cunning. I'm Mother Nature, right? Oh, my God! I'm the snake! You're right. Well, most of the time, yeah. I'm taboo. Cunning. Resourceful. Creative. Therefore, dangerous. Dangerous again. Prove it. It's in the fabric. In the stitches. Oh, yeah. You hate me. But like I told you, I'm not scared of sex. I'm scared of you. Even now, you can taste it on the air. Something like nothing. Like bourbon and flowers. Even now. Even now, you wanna see with my skin, feel with my eyes. My questions, my dreams, my hands, my garden. I can help. I can help you. Even God. You help me? With my body. My thesis. The nights I spent longing for the touch of your hand. Knowing I sacrificed you to him. You were right. He's a worthless tool, and I am sorry. You're apologizing? So? She was good, huh? And you're a dirty old man, too? Aren't we all, according to you? Oh, you're changing so fast. If Aphrodite really was a virgin every morning, she must be exhausted. Blooming overnight. So what do you, um... What do you like now? Like Aphrodite with graffiti. What was she like? See? You really do need me. You know the tiny... the petal, the... The last little bit underneath a flower. When it finally... Like... Finding my virginity. Like... Kissing some ancient grief my grandmother must have passed down or something. Like kissing myself. Like... swimming, or... making sense. It was like making sense. Like nothing. Like something. Hell, God, it was making love. Sense? There's no sense in sex. Well, I learned a lot. Oh, God! Only you could conduct research during your own sexual escapades. Escapades? I have escapades? I like that. You know, I never saw you confused about your own sexuality. I never got kicked out of that garden. I walked out. Goddesses are an endangered species. No, it doesn't convince me. Having been already in your garden, and might I say, my dear, there's nothing wrong there. Look, I'm saving the fruit in here. But it's like the Middle East out there, and I'm the middle. What are you gonna use for visual aids? Visual aids? Listen to me this time. Required visual aids for your oral exam. I know. So, creation story number one had us in one body. Remember the cell? Like, it's what? Two photons, quantum tango. Inexplicably drawn toward each other. Night and day. Ineluctably drawn back toward the original twin. The original Original Sin. Ah. So, did you two, uh... You consummated it. You got the girl. I mean... Girl gets girl, huh? I did. I got the girl. She would never do Adam. - So he... - So... So... So... If three people got married... If three people got married, hypothetically, like a triangle, how is that any less fair to the state than one percent marrying into one bloated bank balance? And to answer your question, sorry to break it to you, dude, but we really don't like you dogs watching. And evidence shows most females are liquid. Fluid, and therefore to some degree bisexual. But here's the key, Doc. We really need our goddesses back. Our movies are the evidence, Doc. They dream of us. Dick flicks, Doc. It's a Dog Day Afternoon when Al Pacino surrenders in white linen with his left wrist, while Serpico waves the gun with his right. Gone with the Wind. Rhett Butler thrashes Scarlett just when that chick is in her prime. She's 21st century. None of those clowns can handle that kind of heat. Pulling up radishes for roses. Bet you something that Scarlett O'Hara swings right up there on that bisexual fence. You knew the lid was blown off this crazy gumbo New Orleans style. Right on up the river to the City of the Angels, and equally abused. Oil, it's just energy from death. Water, life. Waterways of the world, baby, they wear lingerie. Who wears lingerie? Waterways of the world wear lingerie, not boxers. Canals and inlets, streams and ponds and pools. Not skyscrapers. Girls play with girl dolls. You call it soft science. Out tired, our hungry, our unemployed washing up our shores. We treat 'em like backwash. Hard science. Conclusions, Ms. Lili. Evidence, Eve. Hollywood classic. His Girl Friday. Cary Grant knows Ros Russell's no wife. She's a newspaperman. So, he gets the girl, because he gets the girl. Bisexuals, trisexuals, pansexuals, demisexuals, girls gone wild. But in the movies, we look like fucked up druggies who will die for our sins. Well, if the needle fits... Fast forward a few time warps, and what have we got? Lord goddess Melissa, fearless as a mother. New galaxy, The L Word. New solar system. Our Lady of Madonna kissing Britney all the way up the Lady Gaga. Etcetera, baby. Nobody wants to get left out now. You know, I don't blame you girls. I mean, the love of a good, sane woman... You dogs kept it all to yourselves. Killing off our goddesses. So you, uh... What? What? But the truth is, no. I would not watch. I could not watch. The truth is... I never got over you, my little bird. I never let you go. I just thought what other people would say. Chapter five. Heterosexual women do spend more time worrying about what others think. Fact, are more worried about their looks. Fact, do mentally cut themselves and each other, into pieces. Fact, do compete to win what? Stepford men, who do what? Dismantle then trade in their rusty lady parts. Not a controlled experiment. Twins in the womb. Fraternal dizygotic, bi-ovular male, female. Females are willing to allow the males to birth first. But, according to the folklore, should the combination be sororal, females will fight to the death to get born first. Well, the joke's on whoever has to lie about their age first. It doesn't prove, Eve. Well... Did you follow the orientation into later life? Interesting and no. Ah! Because, Doc, the egg is the seed, is the egg. Because, Doc, spontaneous ecstasy in women was burned at the stake. But now... it's up and over the rainbow. It's all brand-new. No, there's nothing new under the sun. And you don't throw it all away to move forward. Um... Dude... Maybe you do. I mean, if you wanna keep dancing, it's your move or mine. What are you, Miss Mad Scientista of the Month? A nude calendar for lady scientists. I'd buy it. I'd be in it. You just go on and on and on. Ms, Lili, I can't decide whether you need a classroom or a barroom. I mean, it seems to me I'm either no longer interested or capable of listening to all of the... So much... I do prove body image fragmentation with cutting behaviors in teenage girls. Since I got married, I've been... I've been doing it again. Oh, gross! It's the split. That's the part that craves independence like oxygen. Wants to please ourselves, love ourselves. No... It's in the wanting. Yes, not the surviving, the thriving. But the identity, it gets flooded with images, commands to please others first. So, we cut. It's not bad. You have the data, I presume. - Mm-hmm. - And the body of the text? Still love you, Doc. Always love you. I love you too, Eve. LOL. I know you saved me before you sacrificed me. So, no harm, no foul. We're all good. LOL? You talk like a text. I mean it. You really are something, huh? You really are. So, uh, where did you run into her? Well... Just past the drum circle. I tripped right over her. Doc, we danced. You danced? Doc, the rhythms. I didn't play them. They played me. Okay. She waited for me on the street. Remember? Like Iphigenia, I remember. To go back and get her. I remember. Like my twin or something. Soulmates. Ah... I guess she was never really alone. And so you breathed new life into her then? New life into me, Doc. Hmm. Yeah. I've lost you. It's done. Well... Now back to this ridiculous choice you're making, Eve. I plead with you, please do not throw away the opportunity to complete your degree. Guess what all female driven stories have in common. Come on, guess. Well, the cat's out of the bag. It's pretty much girl-on-girl. No. That's girl's having each other's backs, and if you want the rest of our bodies, you can have that, too. Fail. Enlighten me. Exhibit A. Self discovery. Profound revelation. What does that mean? B, ESP. Actual community of lovers who maintain community even after couples split. And C, what is the glue that holds together this giant girl cookie? Come on. What is it? Come on. Why is that so interesting? The girl's got choice. All female driven stories. All non-conventional female stories, girl's got a choice. Is that so interesting? Sold, like one who's got all the choices. Yes, I find it very interesting. Commerce, Ms. Eve. It's commerce. And girl-on-girl action? MTV crowd? Men love it. Women? Women are curious now, so the ratings collect rainwater. I'll tell you what. You give it a couple of years, and it's just another yawn. No. No. I'm saying we study it. Like we're in a desert, and this is our oasis. Or mirage. No, the second great flood. Dolphin females play with each other, tempering jealousy. Smart, right? Humans kill our own daughters, and then look to one man to fulfill all our needs. I'm saying, water the waters of the women of the world. Can you see it, Doc? Oh, yeah. From my back porch. Look, maybe you're part-priestess, maybe you're a baby goddess, but you are no scientist. Maybe you don't need a PhD. I need the fair sex out of every closet. Not coming out stories, coming in from the cold. Fair sex economies, ecologies, the fair sex state. So now you're saying we're all cross dressers at heart, huh? Just recognize you in female form. And your plan? Rockstar from Venus, baby. They see me blond, white, educated, married. I'm a fucking petri dish for this rebel girl cocktail. Equation. 21st century girls equals 21st century sex, equals 21st century science, equals survival, baby. Won't you set aside your worn out old manuscript? My life's work for you? Go on, have a cupcake. Do it for you. Shot Garcia Lorca up the ass because he loved men. - Why? - Fear. Tied that shepherd child to a fence. Cried himself into a permanent sleep. Sheep crucifying the shepherd. Why? It's the vicious ones I could never figure out. Vicious ones wanna be loved. Their vocabulary? It's got no girl in it. You push and you push and you push. Maybe... Maybe you do wear the pants. And I want you to accept her in the program. Lilith? No. No way, no. No shape or form. You do not let that viper get near me. You do not let that viper sidle up to me. The closer I am to Lila, the closer I'll be to you. She is smart. She is tenacious. She will rattle the rafters till cobwebs fall away forever. Well, I like cobwebs. You treated her like a weed. That's a powerful flower. God, this is ridiculous. Look, every thesis must, by definition, have a conclusion. Not if I'm using my own dictionary. What? All this and you have time to redecorate Webster? Question. Why can't my thesis just ask questions? Question. Misogyny, the ultimate WMD. You are one percent of the one percent. The most supreme court. Where's the female version of you? You're overreaching, Eve. And don't you dare embarrass me. Question. If women get equal pay, would we marry more women? Would we hire each other? Would we open the door for each other, like gentlemen? So you're not gonna go militant on me? More like a tango up Pico Boulevard. Ah! What to do with you? Do you love her? I want her. Show me your face. Come one, come on, swivel that thing. - No. - Why not? My vineyard is for my very own. Song of Solomon. Look it up. Well, show me something else. It belongs to her for now. Belongs? I thought you were supposed to be against ownerships? Not if I give it. And what do I get? You get my Me-hD. My anti-thesis. So you've done all the yakking, and I still haven't heard your conclusion. Isn't that shocking, huh? Well, come on, let's hear it. Okay. Yes, I'm ready. Not merely a third gender, but a fourth and fifth. Ad infinitum, we are all liminals. Poetry? Back to creation story number one. Each born male and female floating in the amniotic fluid of our same sex desires. Lunch with the girls, the intimacy of shopping. Intimacies of football, too. Title nine, "Crash course in teamwork." Nothing sexier than a group of women playing on the same team. Now, our mothers, they held back. Denial and desire. In playing into the stereotype of the shrew. Yeah, the shrew wife, mommy dearest. So? So? So? Explore women who explore women. Fast. So we don't blow this fucking ball to bits over a little slithering, or lingerie. And men? That's... Guys are wired up in here not to hear what a woman says. Get 'em unwired. Give way to the wildness in women. It's the wilderness in yourself. I see. And until you make it a utopia. I wanna play. Well, Adam's gonna be crushed. Angry. I'll be his wife. But I want one, too. In fact, what I want is a wife for every wife. And what do you have planned for me, missy? Then God said, "I will grant you every seed bearing fruit." I'm intrigued. Support my thesis, my body. Be the feminist you always wished you could be. And make up with Lila. Oh, that's out of the question. You're the feminist. No. I'm a free married woman with a wife. When you locked her out, you locked me in. So, back up your PhD, when you directly refute my theories. My dear, my book comes out in one week. I would be laughed off the page. You can change your book. You have a choice. You're crazy. You try giving birth to yourself. Look, utopia is one thing, but, the female with multi-verse desires written all over her body, not for others, but for herself, what this... That female is... That female is only absent from our dreams, our movies, and our books. That female may not yet be rated, but she exists. Marriage is irrevocable. Like prison without parole? It doesn't have to be. Every time the waiter refuses to address me, every time my name doesn't appear on the invitation, or the credit I deserve... Now, how many times did that really happen? Or the paycheck? Rosa Parks, Daisy Bates... Took it all off for civil rights. Not one of them invited to the White House for the real meal. Valerie Plame and Pussy Riot. I rest my goddamn case. Freud diagnosed bisexual female as hysteric. But in the end, he couldn't figure out what any woman wanted. Amen, brother. You can change your book. A lifetime reputation, and you want me to throw it away and give it away for what again? Doc, I need this. Had I the tongue of Orpheus to sing so the rocks might move. Had I the words to win the hearts of all, I would have used them. Iphigenia. I have only tears. See how I have brought them. I am your supplicant now. Kill me not, for it is sweet to look upon the light. Iphigenia, you ignorant slut. Oh, but, Agamemnon, I did please you so. I am still your morning and your evening star. Are you in love with her? I don't wanna declare a major. Love equals love. It's corny, but it's my one conclusion. There are cities to run, there are countries. Bomb, bankrupt, embargo? So angry. Why aren't you angrier? It's a matter of state. The state of marriage could use a rest. Send it to a day spa for a makeover and a good old-fashioned happy ending. Trade in heavenly for ecstasy. Chapter 10. When the state is nomadic, matriarchs and goddesses are equal. The state wants a goddess. Deserves a goddess. But the goddess, she wants another goddess. Competing with a clutch team of hungry goddesses? Boys will be boys. You sure this isn't penis envy? It's not about winning. We wanna play. You wanna play with each other. You play with each other all the time. Look who's talking penis envy. But we want you. We want us, too. Marilyn died because she wanted herself more than a man. She was a tweener, too. Tweener? Misfit. Tweener. Suspended on a thread, between life and... Life? Yeah. I beg you once again, visual aids, Ms. Lili. It's covered. And what are you bringing? Doc, I'm bringing it. You're bringing it? Oh, yeah. You're bringing what? Do not yell, okay? Hello. Hangover. So you did drink last night. You know, I knew it. This hangover is more like a state of mind. Okay, do not yell. I can't do that, Eve. Well, you'll just have to find out later, then. Oh, you pushy arrogant... Beautiful princess bride, goddess... I won't yell at you. Has anybody ever done a full-blown professional grade striptease while appearing for the oral? Oh, my... You're not gonna be satisfied until I'm completely erased. You chose me, Doc. Remember? Mastery in the bullfight. Quick, clean, close to the horns. Come on, what gender is a cat-bird if stripping isn't gender studies? I know some transvestites who could teach a hell of a semester for you. Doc, tease paid the rent on this birdcage. It's my best visual aid. You see it, too, right? The semantic thread, the body will be the book. The book is the body upon which it's written, right? Question. How would I strip differently for the female gaze? I have no idea. How do we strip for women? Deconstruct the entire semantic text of striptease for men. It's in the body of the text of the body itself. Even the Hollywood boys are doing it now. But are they doing it for the girls? Or are they doing it for the boys? Aw, you know I'm making a valid socioeconomic point here with my brain as sex object. Go on, have a cookie. PhD Committee deserves a little visual aid with my oral. Ah! You gotta listen to every question carefully. Uh-huh. Never address the examiners by their first name. Like an inquisition. Begin every answer by rephrasing the question. Okay. And always, always answer the question. Yup. Resolve the trouble spots. Reacquaint yourself with the fundamentals. I don't pause at conclusions. No, good, good. Defend it. Got it. Well, okay. That was pretty good today, huh? It's too long, gotta cut everything in half, but pretty good. Now, remember. You're the expert here, not them. No matter what they throw at you, and they're gonna be firing at you worse than me. Okay. You gotta defend your materials. You gotta know your experiments, your protocols, your results, your conclusions. I know. I know, I know. But you gotta defend your choice of non-conclusion to the teeth. My choice? Your choice. Your choice, Lili. And you know, uh, take it all off if you have to. But, Lili, I don't think you should have to. I wanna play. Lili? Yeah. Fly, bird. Really? Fly. Fly. You fly. Yes!
