DÖRING FILM G.M.B.H. presents The Immortal Heart with "Much powerful lives, nothing is more powerful than man." Mainsail down! Mainsail, I said. It's not coming down! It's stuck. "CITY OF NUREMBERG" You must stay on course ... ... don't sail for the open sea! Did you bump your nose, Georg? No. Put a stone on the map! And give me the great dividers! Hold tight! Don't let go! Don't let go over there! Close the window! Get me a light! Bring me the lamp! Why are you not at the helm, helmsman? The foresail is going off. Then bring up the mainsail and fix the foresail. I only bring up the mainsail if we stay away from the coast. You stay on the course, I tell you. We stay along the coast. Do you know the waters that good? Do you know the shoals? No, but I want to get to know them. We're here for that. Are you crazy? Because of your goddamn globe, we shall drown? If it must be, yes. Not me! I'll get out. Who's at the helm, helmsman? Who's at the helm, man? Take your place, helmsman! That's mutiny! Mutineers I'll bring to court. Take your place, helmsman. I'll take the helm myself. If something should happen, take the globe and ... ... jump into the water with it. It will carry you. Are you also afraid, you titch? No. Mainsail, up! Mainsail, faster, faster! Pirates! We're carried to the rocks! Sail on the foremast! Sail on the foremast. Sail on the foremast. Georg! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Fire! Take the lifeboat! Put out the fire, you losers! We're lost anyway. But the storm wears off! You can go to Heaven on calm sea, if you really want to. Everybody ... ... off board! Behaim! Four! I can't hit 12. You know what seems to be the trouble? It's not the barrel. It's because of the bullet. The bullet ... ... is spherical. And that's the mistake! It's impossible to hit. Look. If the bullet is spherical ... ... the air slows it ... ... and carries it off course. The bullet ought to be ... ... long. Long? As strange as it may sound. The bullet ought to be long ... And sharp at the front. Then it will cling much better to the barrel. We've made a rifled barrel, didn't we? Now it's ever faster spinning. And drills ... - Yes, drills, yes! And drills itself without restraint to the target. Thus, put two bullets together and sharpen it! Come, Pankraz, come! Come, Pankraz, get the rose! You're giving up, Ev! No, it's a gift. Thanks. It's a pity about you, Ev. Why? We had made a nice couple. Alas! You could have become a Countess Pankraz, and what did you become? Mrs. locksmith master Henlein! He had to work for his title, you inherited it. And then I love Peter Henlein. I'm proud of him, too. So? Konrad? Come over! What is it? What's that? What? What's that? Why? That's Ev! That's my wife! That is ... ... she looks like her. Let this comedy, man! You made the statue. Of course I made it. I don't understand myself that it shows ... Maybe I thought of her ... Maybe? Thought of her? I'll make a new one! And you think that’s the end of it? The statue gets a new face. And that's it. Tell me, lad, do you love Ev? Answer me! So answer me! You have a bad conscience, don't you? Yes or no? Such a stupid rascal! Just sniffed into life and already starts an affair with my young wife? Do you think that I'm too old for her? No. No? Of course you do! Just look at you. Look at me when I'm talking with you. What does it mean, no? I don't want to. He doesn't want to. He doesn't want to. Do you have to want anything? Stop that fiddling! I want an answer! Put it away! I want an answer! A clear answer! What is it? Doctor! Schedel has to come! Doctor! To whom we toast to? To Pankraz? No, to my husband. With that little mug? Why not? Such a small mug for your big husband? Then we have to clink with this. It suits him better. And the first swig ... is for you! Mrs. Henlein! You have to come home! You also have big washday? Your husband is ill. Ill? What's with him? I don't know. You have to come now. How do I get home fast? Come, take the horse. I'll get it picked up later. Shall I ride through town? Who cares about gossip when your husband is ill. Okay, thanks Pankraz. Please take the rose away! Why? Don't ask, throw it away! You were lucky again, my boy. Rest a fortnight and everything is forgotten. Be more careful next time. Stay in bed! What's wrong with you, Peter? Calm down, Ev. Everything is fine. For God's sake! Did you get surgery? Look. Here! It stuck between his ribs. For God's sake! Indeed. For God's sake! Be more careful next time. It can go horribly wrong. How do you look? How am I supposed to look? Where do you come from? Riding with Count Pankraz and boys. You know I can't stand it. Get the rag off! My wife shall not ride with counts. You promised to let it be. I will, but not everything is done fast. And it's not important now. Ev, you have to leave! Peter needs rest. That's what we need now. Marital dispute! Konrad! Have you seen it? Yes. So what? I don't know how it happened. I had the pistol in my hand. We had argued. Suddenly it went off. I don't know ... ... am I responsible or Peter. He slapped on it, you know. You know how it is. When you have to tell later ... ... how it happened. Then it's not possible. We had argued. Why did you argue? Because of me? Not directly. What does it mean? He was angry because of the statue. The sun for the clock. That's supposed to be me? Well ... Naked? Did you go mad? Peter also has said this. What were you thinking? Me appearing every noon on the town hall tower - naked? How did you imagine it? Jesus, I'm already leaving! You treat me like a stupid schoolchild. Ev! Konrad! What secrets does he have? Konrad! Stay in bed, Peter. Both of you are children. Such a wound is no small matter. What are you whispering, both of you? I just said, I don't know how it happened. Only that. That's all I said. I can't lie to Ev. You can discuss that later, not now. Trouble in Henlein's house, trouble in the whole world. He comes just in time. Oh, you're ill! I have news. It should bring you back on your legs. Your friend Behaim ... ... and his nice and mighty ship "City of Nuremberg" ... You know what happened with it? It went down! With all my money! Behaim? Drowned? No, he isn't. He saved himself. The ship is gone. And my proper money. I will take him to court! I ask you, Martin Behaim, in front of the people ... Where is the father of ... Silence! No speeches, give your testimony. He has ... He said, you're mutineers. You're pirates. He wanted to take us to court. He forced us to sail on. Is that correct, Behaim? Yes. You probably believed in strength and seaworthiness of your ship? No. So you knew how dangerous it was? Yes. Murderer! I demand a clear description of the incident from Martin Behaim. It was May 9th when we left the mouth of the river Congo. At noon, 12 o'clock, the sun was at its zenith. Is that so? Shut your mouth! Please! I took the exact time with my pocket sundial. I gave the helmsman order to steer for south-southeast. At 1 o'clock, the sun already had disappeared. The sundial was of no help. Of course! The watch is responsible. I had to stay on course until I could read the time again ... ... and with it my speed. I don't understand. The speed of a ship you can only measure when you count the passing knots ... ... in a certain amount of time. Beside the sundial you had no watch? No, my watches had stopped. It’s a mystery. The watches always go mad when there is only light sea. It's the misery of all seafaring. So the watch is responsible. Of course, the watch is responsible! If a citizen wants to make a statement in this matter ... ... which is a matter of public interest ... ... then he has to do it in due form. Please, go on! Here ... Here is the mouth of the Congo. Here, where the white cross is ... ... is the last marked position on my map. If I wanted to know if the coast ... ... runs westwards or southwards. I had to chose a course, determined in advance, ... ... along the coast. With the length of my voyage, I could measure the coastal length. And could copy the characteristics to the globe. If I had changed the course ... ... I had been forced to return to my starting point. I had lost many days. The spell of bad weather had fallen on us. Never I would have gained my goal. And did you achieve it? Keep to due form! Or shut your mouth! May I have the floor? Does one of the juryman object? Please! Make it short! How can Martin Behaim jeopardize other people's property and life ... ... in criminal manner? With what right? The ship costs me 30.000 Gulden. Yeah, I know, there must be heroes! And they are meant to die. I am no hero. And I don't want to be one. But from history I know that they do exist. I beg for silence! Silence! The ship was meant to honor the name of our city, ... ... to bring pepper and spices to Nuremberg ... ... and, on the side, to serve scientist Behaim. But it wasn't meant to be endangered because of criminal negligence ... even to be destroyed in the end. We simple citizens don't care whether Africa’s coast is round or notched! I wonder who cares, except for Martin Behaim! Stop showing off! I demand from the court the hardest punishment for Martin Behaim! Exactly! May I have the floor? Speak, Henlein! I may remain seated, I have not recovered yet. My apologies, high court, but I intend to speak my mind. I'm ashamed to sit here as juryman, having to listen to this. Who is this man, standing in front of us? A son of our city. A great son of our city. Our Martin Behaim. A man, scientists and scholars of our, well, of and each and every German city ... ... admire with respect. A man ... ... who went away ... ... a seafarer ... ... to bring us the world as God created it. In this globe there ... ... this earth like ball ... He sacrificed lives, yes. Had to sacrifice them! As he had sacrificed his own life. If the sea itself hadn't saved him. Pathetic! Pathetic! We should be ashamed. To put a man on trial who achieved all this! Instead of helping him, instead of supporting him ... ... to keep him on track of his great path to the end ... His disgrace is our disgrace. But his honor is also our honor! I request ... ... to dismiss the charges. And, on the contrary, to ask him to try again. To sail out again on a journey around the world. For the glory of Nuremberg and for the safety of the people. Furthermore I request, to avoid the loss of lives ... ... to provide him with three ships instead of one. My son-in-law has no penny, but sacrifices 90.000 Gulden ... ... of other people's money. I'm saying three ships ... ... and I won't tolerate ... ... that the honor of Nuremberg goes mean and small minded in public. At least not as long as I'm sitting here. I adjourn oral proceedings, the jury retires for deliberation. Let's eat! - Maybe we should better wait. The food is only getting cold. There you see, Peter does as he likes. Come, take a seat. The meat is way too long in the pan. It's already black. It's not Peter's fault when the trial lasts so long. Is it my fault? How are you looking at me? I don't. Don't you want to eat? Are you afraid of Peter? No. Of you. Me? Am I something dreadful? Perhaps the devil? Or a witch? More likely a witch. Something shines in your eyes that makes me shiver. Your a little poet. Look at this! Only famous men in the house. Only me ... ... a pile of nothing. You're more than all of us together. Your little finger is already more. So? Then tell it to him! What? Tell him yourself. What? You have to tell the little finger. Tell it to him! You ... ... that's already the whole hand. Konrad! Thou shalt not desire thy neighbor's wife. Yes, Konrad. We have to forget it, Ev. One cannot forget it, Konrad. We better wait with the meal. I couldn't eat now. Behaim is urged to provide a watch within a year... ... which absence was responsible for the accident as he asserted. A watch that is not getting seasick ... ... and which action is independent of the elements. If Behaim provides this watch, he shall get three new ships. So he can finish his globe. The trial is closed. Congratulations, Behaim. - Thanks. Good day, Henlein! Good day, Sixtus! I'll wait until everyone has left. Come Peter! What are you waiting for? Your stubbornness succeeded. Thank you, Peter. You did find good words. How did you imagine this watch? How should it be? A watch without weights. That's the whole secret. A watch without weights. Don't you feel well, Peter? A watch without weights. Forget the watch. You have to go home! One had to come up with something to replace the weights ... Come Peter! A pendulum doesn't work either. I'm coming. What is it? I can't. What does it mean? I can't breath when I get up. It was a stupidity to get up and to come here. It doesn't heal within 3 weeks. As you see, nothing happened. What do you want? You treat me like a corpse. Don't joke, Peter! Lie down! Something isn't right with your wound. Something wrong, Peter? Just let me alone! Here ... ... everything alright? Nothing happened when I was gone? Nothing. Then it's alright. Come in, Behaim. Lock the door behind you. Did Peter come? - Yes. He's not alone? - Schedel is with him. And Behaim. Schedel? Why? Something is wrong with him. Schedel wants to examine him again. Peter? Why are you locking the door? Peter, open up! Peter! A spring! Of course! A spring. What lifts can also pull. Peter, open up! Don’t be so secretive! Don't make such noise, Ev. What's with Peter? It will show. Where is the bullet I gave you recently? Why? I want to see it. Maybe a part of it is still in Peter's body. I have to be certain. I donated it to Mother of God. Alas! His mother told me to. Get it to me. But I can't take it away again! Why not? From the altar? Well done with your fuss about saints. How did the bullet look like? Like every bullet. No, I forged it out of two bullets. It was a long bullet. Two bullets. Forged together, one bullet. Here it is. Schedel, it's a dedicated candle! You must not take it! - Don't be silly. You're right. A part is missing. It was a long bullet, forged out of two bullets. You know for sure? - Yes. Maybe I didn't do it properly. Because I had argued with Peter. Well ... ... you two! Don't let me wait so long, Bratvogel. Why? You're in a hurry? Yes, you must come to my Peter instantly. Your close friend, Dr. Schedel, couldn't help? Shut up! And he thinks he knows it all, he even has studied in Padua. I don't go to your son. He's a friend of Dr. Martin Luther. Decent people don't go there. If he wants something, he comes. That's enough to come, Bratvogel. Despite of Martin Luther. I don't like patients the heathen doctor already bungled with ... But in the end when science has failed ... Who has to help? Quack Bratvogel. With his sacred waters ... ... and his blessed mixtures ... The angel of Tobias supports him. Who made old Jew Tobias see again with fish gall. I don't want to keep the holy water away from your son. Hold it! You have to wait. Patience ... ... is the soul of health! Don't you understand? Of course, yes. Look at this! Two of a kind together! Well? Will you stay much longer? Yes, quite a while. Peter shall make the watch for my ship. Of course! My son-in-law makes the watch! Who else? Again 4 to 5 years before you will earn money. Tinkering and tinkering ... Always making useless stuff. And who pays? Perhaps you? Yes, me! I could rent this house to master baker Weigel. He'd pay twice as much. More important, he would pay. But you? Since eight months you haven't paid rent. And why? Because you don't finish the town hall clock. This must stop now! You must finish the clock within eight days. I also need my money. I won't get money for the town hall clock. The city keeps it for taxes. The city keeps it? Look at this! The city is smart and I pay the piper. You have money enough. Why pressing me? What? I have enough money? You never have enough money! I'll tell you something. My fish trade goes worse every day. And why? Because I don't have any funds. And my capital, which amount you overestimate, is invested. But my competitor, juryman Weihrauch ... ... unfortunately has a much bigger and LIQUID capital! And why? He hasn't got a sloppy son-in-law! Who keeps a fortune back. His rent. But Güldenbeck ... I know what you want to say. You're an idealist, a genius. But what you're calling genius, I do call crazy. Who wants to be crazy, needs money in the first place. What's all that noise, damn it! You're in a sickroom, my dear. Act like it! And you? Still not in bed. Lay down! And you scram, understood? You too, Behaim! In the presence of a friend, Dr. Schedel, I'm saying ... I expect that in three months time, you leave this house or pay your debts. To the last penny! In this house there is no space for geniuses. My money is too good for geniuses. Get well! Damn it! Will I never get rid of it? Of course. And I will help you. Look at this, Peter. The inwards of the human body. Look. Here! There the bullet has entered. It's a peculiarity that a metallic element ... ... starts to wander in the human body. It's very probable that the bullet will take this way. Between muscle 'A' and 'F', you're seeing here. Directly towards the heart. If the bullet touches your heart, you're finished. It's about time that it gets removed. Well ... Sounds reasonable, but ... There is no 'but', Peter! Isn't it possible to delay the operation? - No. Since when you are scared? - I'm not scared. What else? - I don't know. It doesn't suit me today. Then I'll be back tomorrow. I see! You have another doctor. Bratvogel, what are you doing here? I asked him to come. I wasn't pleased to come, but a true Christian has to help ... Peter's illness brought the devil. Bad thoughts lead to argument, bad thoughts are the root of this evil. Where the devils resides, the priest has to enter. With God's holy pharmacy. I know you don't like Bratvogel. But I'm the mother. I have a right concerning my son. More than you. Peter, whether you like it or not. Bratvogel will examine you. No, mother. Do it for me! No, mother. I don't believe in Bratvogel's quackery. I believe in reason which can explain ... ... how to return from the disorder in my body ... ... to order. And Schedel can do it. Nobody can reliably say what will happen ... But I know one thing. Bratvogel won't hurt! He will. It's bad for me to do things, I don't believe in. What's actually wrong with you, Peter? Don't you carry the bullet, your friend and rival Konrad Windhalm ... ...has shot into your stomach? If you were not that pathetic ... ... and a guest of my mother's. You would catch a slap ... ... that all of Earth's suffering would burn on your face for life. Oh, getting cheeky, Mr. Henlein. Do you know that the cold hand of death rests on your shoulder? Don't you remember? Half a year ago someone shot at the Emperor. Some heretic did it. They fired on the heretic and hit his body. The bullet was sitting on the same spot like in your case. And then your friend came along. Cutting a big hole in the heretic's body. And his life was flowing away. In a broad red river. Three days later, he even wanted to dissect that poor soul! To the benefit of mankind! If you want to bless mankind in the same manner ... ... then stay with your friend Schedel. Violence! Violence! Violence! Viol ... Shit head! Tell me, Schedel. Was Bratvogel right? Did he die because of your cut? No, he died because of the bullet. But you were operating? Yes. I have to admit ... ... a medical malpractice did happen. Well, it's human. But the malpractice could happen again. With me. No, you don't make the same mistake twice. Maybe you make another one? Naturally it could happen. But this way you will die with certainty. He dies with certainty? His life rests in his hands. - Peter? Is it true? - I don't know. But I know. And that is enough. Or do I talk just for fun? Schedel? How long will it take the bullet to reach my heart? There is for sure no time to answer silly questions. I have to know exactly. I'm not a prophet. It can last a year. It can last four or five weeks. Five weeks ... that would be enough. What for? Five weeks ... or three. Three weeks for what? You are my friends! I can tell you everything. I want to make the watch. What kind of watch? For Behaim? It isn't invented yet! I want to invent it! The watch that works on ships! Can't you wait? Can you promise me that I won't bleed out under your knife? See, you can't. And I must not bleed out under your knife. What are you thinking? Schedel must operate you! Even women come to reason if they have to. Since when you're cowardly? I have to be cowardly, mother! Remember, what you've told me? Your fear of thunder and lightning ... ... when carrying me under your heart. And that no thunderstorm scared you once I was born? My child, too, ... ... wants to be born. And when it is born ... ... you can come. But not before. Leash the dog, Ev! It's bad? No. It's not bad. I've said so. You got up too early. You'll catch death with your silly ideas. I'll be back! You're hiding something! Peter! What can we hide from you, stupid child? Schedel! - Ev? I've noticed very well. You can't lie to me. Peter is very ill, isn't he? - No. I wouldn't leave otherwise. You said, you'll be back! Yes. - When? Tomorrow morning. So early? Then Peter is very ill. Well, Ev. Don't ask so much. If I need you, I will call for you. Certainly? Certainly. See you. - See you. Peter! You're creating an excuse. You're looking for a stupid and diabolical reason, ... ... making it possible for you, ... ... to throw your life away. But neither Ev nor me nor someone else will take such a gift. Don't scream at me! Nobody can blame me for thinking about Ev's future ... ... when I leave this world on my own will. But it's suicide, Peter! You must not do it. It's a sin! I must not ... Every soldier is allowed to die for the fatherland. Am I less, am I more cowardly than a soldier? Soldiers follow orders of the Emperor! I follow the order of someone, whom even the Emperor has to obey. And He says ... Thou will know them by their fruits. Isn't it said this way? The ears carry their fruits ... ... and die. Isn't it like that? Peter? Yes, Ev? You wanted to show me something. Yes, I'm coming. Don't run around barefooted, you've taken a bath. You will catch a cold. I will wait for you. If one sees you lying in bed then reasonable talking is impossible. Why always reasonable talking? Look! What is it? A spring. And a wheel. Spring and wheel, yes. When I wind up this spring ... ... wind up ... very firm. As firm ... ... as it ... only ... gets. Look! If I release it now ... You're laughing. Then the wheel is moving. Of course. Of course. But nobody has thought of it. You know, this is becoming the watch. Where is this a watch? Where are the hands? Perhaps you can tell me the time? It's becoming the watch, my child! Look, this spring replaces the weights. This little spring won't pitch and roll like weights on sea. It won't become seasick. For every ship, you can hold it like this and ... You can even carry it in your pocket. It never stops. Peter, you look like a little boy. Is that toy so much fun? It's not a toy. It's a very serious matter. Always talking about serious things. There are other things in life, Peter. Darling, you. No. Look ... ... now it's jumped out. The spring. It's too silly. I have to do it again. I'll be back. If it's getting late, I will sleep again. Don't wake me up then! No, no. I'll be quiet. I won't wake you. You? What do you want here? - I want to Peter. Still sleeping. - So? What time is it? Past six. What do you want that early? I worry about Peter, Ev. He has worked all night. On his newest toy. He can't be that bad. Is he feverish? - I don't know. Ask him. Wake him up! Did you argue? So you have. No. What is it then? Nothing. Look! I knew it. Don't argue with him now, Ev. Peter! Peter! What is it? I'm here, Schedel. Yeah, I know. I think it's better, you let me sleep some hours. Yesterday you said, you want to wait three weeks for operation. It's no solution! Damn it, I want to sleep! Everyone is dragging me. I know myself what I'm doing. Come back tomorrow or the day after. I will call you. Is it really true? I don't know, but the world is bad. One Groschen is missing! I thank Heaven that I'm not like him. I almost can't believe it. - Why? I can believe it easily. Phooey! Phooey! is the whole world. It wouldn't be the first time ... ... that a young and beautiful woman ... ... strays off with a young and beautiful man. But when the lover shoots at the husband then ... ... I have to say ... - It's murder! Attempted murder. Attempt, my dear. Always be just! Heaven is listening. And he got cuckolded. So? Who is it? Count Pankraz. It's not true! It serves him right ... ... this heathen, heretic, Lutheran and potbelly! But God may watch merciful and forgive their sins ... ... as we forgive those who trespass against us. Where is the Groschen? Not here! I don't borrow. Come again, my child, and get your ointment. But my mother is ill. She's waiting for it! Well ... Praised be Jesus Christ. In eternity. Amen. Don't always cross yourself, I'm not the devil. It must be allowed to talk reasonably about it. What does it mean, 'belief'? Belief! What is your Christian God saying? I love the people on condition that they believe in me. On condition! Do you love your son 'on condition' ... ... that he loves you too? That's it what is called love! To love without condition! Hold your head in shame, Schedel! You're left alone for five minutes, and you're at loggerheads. I'm terribly sorry, Peter, but your mother can't help it. She wants to convert everybody. You can be a good man, without believing in this stuff. 'Stuff' - I beg you! Keep your cynicism when mother is here. Believing ... ... is a blessing ... ... not everyone has gotten. And who can't believe is less than we. What a hilarious arrogance! Humility! Do you go to church? I only see you in the pub. Do you take the Holy Communion? - Alas! It's not done with 'alas'! I think every Christian soul is more interested in his daily lunch ... ... than in Holy Communion. Peter! Please, go! You don't have to return. If necessary, I will call you. Then it's too late! - So be it. I can't change it. Makes me throw up! The only one, who could help you, has left. Don't cry, mother. You know me, there is no point in it. You're so pigheaded. You thoughtless rascal, always hitting ... ... always destroying everything around you. If you also start arguing, you will be thrown out as well. Don't you be scared? Of what? Because of dying? Not because of dying, Peter. But what follows! You have to answer for your actions. I should be afraid because of the Lord? But why? You know what's waiting if you scorn God's commandments. You don't respect them with suicide! You will go to hell! Well, mother. Hell ... ... I don't believe in it. Who comes to hell is already in hell on earth. Not only on the other side. You see ... I am in a heaven ... ... you don't even foresee. This Luther is in you! Like a plague he goes around. Four days ago ... ... this Dr. Martinus Luther ... ... this plague as you all call him ... ... has nailed 95 theses ... ... to the castle church of Wittenberg. And I felt as if I were born again. And with me the whole of German Christendom. As if we had entered paradise through opened gates. And from that very hour, Holy Scripture had a completely different face. And in Latin words I found German meaning. And the meaning was ... ... the works of God ... ... stand for ... ... what God effects in us. The power of God ... ... is that what makes us powerful. The wisdom of God ... ... is what makes us wise. And so I recognized that the Christian is no slave of his God. But a brother of God's son. I stand up, because someone must come ... ... to prevent with strong arms ... ... that a desperate mankind loses God completely. I will show you God ... ... who is your friend. Whose language is German and your's. Whose language is German and your's. Well, Peter. German or Latin. That's the same. Pious we have to be and to believe. No, no, no, mother. Pious you have to be with a clear mind. Not lulled into incense and organ music ... ... and a language, we don't understand. Do you speak Latin with me when talking about God? Of course not. You see, you're saying 'of course'. And that's why Luther is my friend. He also says, 'of course' is God speaking German in Germany. We're chatting ... and a man shall not chat, but work. Then he is pious. Jesus Christ, lead my Peter with your tender hand. Lead him the small path. Mother Maria, don't take my Peter away. If you want to punish me, then don't punish me ... ... by taking his life, punish me on my body ... ... on my soul not on his. Oh, sweet Passion hear, master of choirs ... I swear on your five wounds, I will love Peter until all eternity. Amen. If you also lose your mind then he is finished. I was counting on you, Behaim. Henlein listens to you. Maybe. I don't even think of it! What sissies you are! A man gets up to finish his work ... ... to sacrifice his life ... ... and you come up with crazy ideas of humanism ... ... just to make sure that he dies as an old man. Henlein will finish his watch. And I'll be the last to stop him. And if he dies? Then he will die. Your fuss about dying. It's not that important. Everyone has to die. I prefer dying with a goal ... ... to dying because of debility or medical help. You're a man of reason. Can I guarantee that Henlein will live two or three weeks ... ... or as much as he needs to finish his watch? And I have to say, clearly and honestly, I can't. He can die tomorrow. He can already be dead. You're saying it's possible that Henlein dies and we have no watch? You bet that it can happen! You heroes! Sacrifices must be made with mind. If you explain to Konrad how you want to make the watch ... ... then Konrad can make it just like you. In the end it's indifferent whether you or he finishes the watch. It's not indifferent at all ... ... but ... ... maybe you're right. This watch ... ... is my child. At the end of my days I'd like to look back ... ... saying ... ... this is my work. I have created it. Only me. But maybe you're right. Maybe Konrad can finish the watch. If I should bleed out under Schedel's knife. Konrad, come over. You know what I've done so far. All what's missing is the escapement. Which has to be attached to this wheel. An escapement that with constant force ... ... prevents this wheel ... ... from racing. It has to go slower? Much slower! I already have done the calculations. No! The force ... ... has to go somewhere. I have to deal with the extant force ... ... within the spring ... How to say it? It has to be wasted, somehow. That means ... I have to create ... ... a counter movement. Some ... balance spring ... ... that consumes the energy. The wheel ... ... shouldn't ... ... always spin into one direction. But ... ... to and fro. To and fro. To and fro. Like the pendulum in the other clocks. The spring you made today is much too weak. It has no tension! It must be another force that drives the spring. What force? I don't know. If I knew, problem solved. And you think I can promise to find that force? You know me. I can't. There you have it. No man can promise to invent. That's the point. Neither can I. We don't want to deceive ourselves, Ev. It's not possible. Am I disturbing you? Behaim! You already want to get your watch? I break out in a cold sweat. We're not at this point. One is hearing about prodigies. Where is your watch? Over there, not much to see yet. And, Ev? Please go and get a bottle of wine, 1509-er, late harvested, you know. The one for special occasions. With yellow seal. Wonderful. But now is not the time to drink wine. I have to speak about important things, Henlein. Is Konrad disturbing? Perhaps. Then go out and check whether it's raining. So, what is it? You will excuse that I go on working. But every minute is precious. That's from Dürer. Are you making it? No, I'm not making guns. I make only parts. I'm more interested in little things. Where is it going to? 15 are meant for the fortification on the western gate. But there are enough. They go to the scrap heap. Like me! You're still too young for it. It's all gallows humor. In thunderstorm mood? Maybe I better leave? Be nice to him, Ev! He is such an infrequent visitor. Drink with us, Ev! On your health, Peter! I wouldn't drink to that. I would do something for it! You're sitting here, drinking wine with Peter. But it's all your fault! You ordered that goddamn watch! Clink glasses ... ... but without me! I can't change it. How do you feel? The wound, you mean? Does it hurt much? If your already asking, it hurts. And how long can you endure it? No idea. And the watch? Can you finish it? But of course! Of course. If something should happen, you know what I mean ... Don't be in sorrow about Ev. I'll give her a pension ... ... of 300 Gulden per year. Confirmed in writing. 300 Gulden per year? Nice amount. But when my watch is finished, she won't need a pension. Ev will have lots of money. You can even borrow from her. I demand that you stop my husband from making this watch. But that's impossible. It was in your power to issue this stupid order ... ... which costs my husband's life today. Then it will be in your power, to withdraw this order. Even if we would take it back, it would be futile. Listen, my child, well, that's what you are. Don't you want to take a lawyer ... ... who will draft your application in a way that the court can act? My husband can be dead by then. Ev, one question. You said that your husband ... ... locks himself in at night and stays away from your room and more. When did those strange things start? Six weeks ago, perhaps. Since six weeks your husband is breaching his marital duties. Well, let's use this! I didn't want to say that. Stop those embarrassing questions! Perhaps we can help you this way. If we can establish the fact ... ... that your husband behaves unlawful within the marriage ... ... we, the custodians of law, have the means to act. The church can act as well. Because marriage is a covenant before God, not before humans. With church you won't get him anywhere. Why not, my child? Don't you think it would help, to send him a confessor ... ... who explains the meaning of suicide for eternity? Really ridiculous! Why is it ridiculous? He won't let in a confessor. Why not? My husband doesn't believe what is so certain for you. He has his own belief. A friendship of souls with Dr. Martin Luther. That's a man in Wittenberg. We do know who this Martin Luther is. We know only too well, Ev. Consider what you're saying, Ev! I want to beg my fellow juryman, not to hinder the plaintiff ... ... from making a statement that could help to recognize ... ... and to exterminate this devilish plague. What does all this have to do with it? Don't you want to help me, preventing the suicide of my husband? We want. But the course we take you have to leave to us. You may step back. Where am I supposed to go? You can go home. When we need you, we will call you. I have to propose a motion. Please. In this court, Mrs. Ev Henlein has declared ... ... the court clerk shall write this down ... ... that her husband, Peter Henlein, has a friendship of souls ... ... with Martin Luther. She then said ... ... that Peter Henlein disobeys and combats ... ... the habits and customs of our only blessed church. With this I press charges against Peter Henlein. I request the court to summon him and to press charges because of heresy. But don't we want to help this woman? If the man is to be locked away, her is helped. Then he won't continue his work on the watch. A nice family, those Henleins. The husband a heretic, the lad is said to have an affair ... ... with the wife ... ... and shoots at his master. The model of a bourgeois household. Those are the friends of Dr. Martin Luther. The plague sticks on his throat. That's a maenad. Do you like her? I don't know. It's no Christian saint. She is pleasing people. Actually a saint as well. What is this all about? Come with me! Look ... ... reason ... ... and religion ... ... and friendship. They didn't help so far. Take a seat, please. Now only one means is left ... ... to keep Peter connected to live. It's a very mundane one. What do you want from me, tell me? That Peter loves you and that you're loving Peter, I know. But are you ... well, how to say it? Don't make it complicated for me! You know what I mean. What does it concern you? A lot! It's very important for what I want to suggest. The court speaks about my physical life with Peter. My mother-in-law speaks about it. And I think you're beginning as well. You're a smart child. Then you're smart enough to know that the greatest power of your's ... ... is your body. I know that. If you know that so well then everything will be easier. Listen! Peter has to see you as you were created by God. You have to stand before him bodily. Dance for him, flowers in your hair, wreaths, just like the maenad. But the maenad is naked! Of course she is naked. You must make working impossible. Dancing in front of him, naked? What sense shall it make? Not only dancing! You have to use all means. You must force him to you. Devilish means they are! Of course devilish means. What else? You're a woman. That's a real cheek! You've seen how your heaven has worked. Schedel, you're godless. If you don't want to then let it be. Who says that I don't want to? Maybe you have reasons. One never knows. What reasons shall I have? Who asks much ... ... gets many answers. Schedel, you're Satan. Then I'm allowed to speak of Konrad Windhalm? What has he to do with it? Everything, I think. It looks like ... I really understand that the young ... ... and slim Konrad Windhalm has an advantage to your husband. I understand. And so I understand your rejection. Schedel ... I'm not bad! I didn't say that. I don't act as guardian of moral standards. Not me. I know how it looks within me. Good evening! Good evening, Ev! It's late, you better go to bed. This is your favourite song, Peter. 'Innsbruck, I have to let you go' Yes, a nice song. Innsbruck, I have to let you go. Are you not afraid sometimes that it could mean ... Nuremberg, I have to let you go? Nuremberg ... ... I have to let you go. Peter! Look. Now I've lost it! Ah, child! What is it? I'm working ... Only once the door is open and you're coming to disturb me. Let it be! What's with you? What is wrong? I'm a maenad, Peter. What are you? You must not die! She's a maenad and I must not die! That's not out of your child's mind. Schedel drummed it into you, I guess? She's a maenad! Give me my coat! Ev, poor little Ev! Come here, darling. Don't be angry that I laughed at you. Don't be angry, little Ev. I have no more hope. You have no heart! But child! The sooner you let me work, the more hope is ... ... that everything will be alright. Nothing will be good! Everyone knows! Your mother knows. Schedel knows. Everyone knows. You will die! But ... Ev, look ... ... you're my wife. When nobody understands me then you should. You're loving me. So you know that! Nevertheless the watch is more important to you than me! Let the watch be! The watch, the watch! Always the watch! And who am I? Soon I'm the famous widow of a famous dead man in Nuremberg. But I want to live my life. I didn't marry you that you honor my love ... ... with an unfaithfulness that is beyond tolerable extent. You're screaming and getting excited, because I looked Konrad into the eyes. Why did I do it? Why did the dark desires within me wake up? You left me alone in my bed! You left me alone at the table. You let me go to church alone. Almost never you spoke about love. You're speaking about guns and the flight of the eagle into the sun. I can already see that children in school have to learn the famous ... ... name Peter Henlein. In the year 1517 the pocket watch was invented ... ... by Peter Henlein, the famous master locksmith and genius. The city of Nuremberg has a great reputation. Albrecht Dürer ... Hans Sachs, Peter Henlein ... ... are the great names. Your Behaim is as crazy as you are. But your monuments will be erected on the squares of Nuremberg. An iron badge will be placed on our house. 'Here lived and died the famous Peter Henlein.' And nobody will ever know ... ... that a woman went to rack and ruin because of it. Don't touch me! You don't have to pay for it! You have your glory in eternity, which means so much to you. But me? What do I have? All I have is the pain, the agony and the sacrifice. But this is every man's arrogance and pride. That he thinks, his wife exists only for him. She has to live and to die for him. That's what you think in your heart, in your false heart. But I'll give you an answer. In the name of all women. I'll answer to your arrogance and pride with these fingers. Let the watch be! It shall cease to exist! 17 days ... ... I worked on that ... ... which you have destroyed within a second. But it doesn't matter. I don't have to reinvent it. Two days work and everything will be alright. Don't cry! If it were worth living for a person ... ... then for you. But a man, who wants to venture something great ... ... must not ask his wife whether he is allowed to venture it. Go ... ... don't wait for me in your bed. Konrad! Konrad! Ev? Come down, Konrad! Now, in the night? - Yes! I'm coming. Ev? What is it? Come! What's on your mind? Do you love me, Konrad? If you love me, I want to know. You know that. Would you do everything for me? Everything? I don't make such promises. Konrad ... Oh, Konrad! Ev! What do you want? I want to save Peter and you shall help me. You're embracing me, because you want to help Peter? I'll give you everything if you help me. Everything. Do you understand, Konrad? Everything! What's wrong with you? Come to your senses! I've destroyed Peter's watch tonight. And you have to stop him from making a new one! I can't do it. And I don't want to. Do you want that Peter dies? No. Ev, I can't think like Peter does. I'm not a genius. I know he has different expectations of life. Therefore he got you. He also has different expectations of heaven and eternity. Because of that he is making the watch. He must make it. You are deserting me, all of you. Ev! If you will need me, I'm always there. Yeah, yeah. I know. Where do you come from? I went for a walk. Did you meet Konrad? No. Did you meet Ev tonight? Yes. So, you did meet Ev tonight. At least you're not lying. And? Don't you have to say something? No. No. It's better anyway. It's not important at all. Good morning! Good morning, Behaim! Already up? You're getting impatient? Did you get a writ of summons? What? To court. - Did I steal? You're charged with heresy! So? By whom? I don't know. And when I'm summoned? - Tomorrow forenoon 11 o'clock. I can't. It has to be postponed. I already tried. It's not possible. You tried everything? - Yes. With whom? - The captain of the castle, Zinderl. That's insane. Just now? It doesn't suit me at all. I talked with Zinderl. Go to the castle! The Emperor won't come to Nuremberg for two or three months. Zinderl gives you his tower room. There you can work and nobody will search you there. I never said anything to anyone. At the most I dropped a word at home. You shall not do that. Do you think one of my household has reported me? Not reported, but your wife was careless. Before court. What did she do before court? She wanted the court to force you .... Good morning, Ev! Good morning! Good morning, Ev. I'm summoned to court. So? Ev? You have destroyed my watch. You take me to court. Do you think that's decent, child? Yes! I love you. And everything you do. But I beg you to leave my house. You're disturbing my work. Go to my mother's. You throw me out? I don't want to fight with you, child. You're my enemy. Out of love, I know. But you're my enemy. I'm going. But not to your mother. You will never see me again. You! Behaim! Tonight, 10 o'clock! No, tomorrow morning. 4 o'clock. Then the guards of the castle are relieved. It's the only time we can enter the castle unseen. Zinderl awaits us. Everything alright? Jawoll! Jawoll! Then you're relieved. Ride for the others. I will wait here. Jawoll! Jawoll! That's inhuman! We know that you are friends with the heretic Peter Henlein. I declare captain Zinderl to be prejudiced. But he is right. I also wish for a less restrictive measure ... ... to force Peter Henlein to court. His guilt isn't proved yet. Then why did he run away? With it he confesses his guilt. He who has not done wrong, doesn't run away. He will come back. Since two days he is missing. And you say he will return. No! There is intention behind it. If a man like him, whom we know as stubborn and brave ... ... I have to admit it ... ... if such a man has decided not to appear before court ... ... then it takes hard and inhuman measures to force him. I beg you to take a vote on my motion. The church demands its right. If you're in favour of juryman Weihrauch's motion, lift your hand. 7 against 6, because I'm also against the motion. The motion is adopted. Therefore I declare ... The high court of Nuremberg has established that Peter Henlein ... ... and his lad Konrad ... ... Windhalm ... ... can not have left the city, because the gates were closed at night. And no guard has seen them at day. We conclude that they still are within the walls of the city. The high court has therefore decided to have publicly announced ... ... in a way that Peter Henlein has to hear it ... ... the following decision: If the escaped Peter Henlein ... ... doesn't surrender to the court until tomorrow 6 o'clock ... ... then his wife, Ev Henlein, maiden name Güldenbeck ... ... will be taken hostage and sentenced to be pilloried till six o'clock. The citizens of the city are requested to join the spectacle. The high court will subsequent to the spectacle ... ... schedule a new trial. And sentence Peter Henlein in absentia. Damn dogs! What shall they do? Konrad! If you want to go down ... ... because of Ev ... ... to tell them ... ... where I am ... ... then I'm not angry with you. Konrad! Do you love Ev? Yes. If Ev is pilloried ... ... you know what that means ... ... for our decent citizens. Yes. And what do you think? We will never be able to make such a small spring. She doesn't temper, she is too thin! Will you go down? No. We both belong together. I won't go until the watch is ticking. And if the world goes to the devil. We must succeed! All what's missing is this little damn spring Maybe we can use two stop springs? And not a feathered spring! Stop and return have to balance the wheel permanently. Hey, Zinderl sharpens his knife. Then we'll get pork and fresh blood and liver sausage. That's what we need. It screamed at last, was squeaky ... ... then it was gone, the little piggy. A pig? A pig bristle! What? A pig bristle? Of course! A pig bristle. That's our spring! A pig bristle. It's springy, you never noticed? Don't you have a brush at home? - Of course. Then we have our spring! Get me a pig bristle. A pig bristle, but a great one! From the back or tail, it doesn't matter. But I can't! If they do spot me? Then I'll have to go. It must work! I must get a pig bristle. A big ... I must go! I must get it. Do you go to court? I don't think about it! - And your wife? I can't help her. Please support her! I still need two days. Then my watch is finished. I beg you, Behaim, please get me 2 or 4 or 6 or 12 pig bristles. As many as you can get. Good heavens! For what? Don't ask so much, go! I beg you! In two days you will hear it ticking. You can avoid pillory when you renounce him. The church gives you the right. He is a heretic. Would you have the same opinion of Peter if you could sell his watch ... ... instead of sitting in this stinking fish shop? Do you really think he can do it? Innkeeper Schwerte sends five boxes of smoked herrings back. One and a half pound are missing. They probably got a bit dry. That makes them lighter. He neither wants dry fish. Then he shall forget it. That troublemaker. And you really do think that toying leads to something? But you know Peter. If he has set his mind on something then it's going to be. You know, he throws his life away all in vain. How does it look like, such a watch ... I mean ... what size? Very small. Like an onion or a chicken egg. Like a chicken egg? Then you can carry it around, on a chain around the neck. Of course. Or in the pocket. Pocket watch. That would be great. A pocket watch! That can become big business. Actually your right. Stay with him, take the pillory. How long will it last? Only 12 hours! What did I have to stand in life! It took much longer than 12 hours. It's bothering, bothering ... Nuremberg ... Chicken egg ... Nuremberg egg. The Nuremberg egg! I had to talk to him ... You really don't know where he is? No. If I knew, I were with him. Although I've said to him that he won't see me again. Child, that was a mistake! A woman has to stand with her husband. Especially in hard times! Your mother used to think like this. And it wasn't easy with me, believe me. Nuremberg egg. Do you think one should give him a hand? Such a work costs something. He doesn't need anything from you. Why not? Don't be oversensitive! Peter isn't it either. If he makes the watch then he has an interest to sell her. It has to be made known! It has to be praised! It has to be good and proper promotion. Nuremberg egg - that sounds like something! How shall people know that in Nuremberg a watch is being made? That Nuremberg eggs are laid. It has to be cackled, my child. Loudly be cackled! Cackling is the very soul of business. And cackling is my business. I'm the right man for it. If Peter would hear you. I think he would spit out in front of you. You speak with your father like that? Do you know the fourth commandment? Honor father and mother! Alas! What's that supposed to mean? Heretic, pillory and now that! Please ... One has to keep composure in life. I could tell you so much about Peter. What kind of man he is. What kind of man is he, your Peter? Very often I was thinking about him. I don't understand such people. You're saying he will die, Schedel says so ... Everyone says it. He himself knows that he'll die ... It is hard. Nevertheless he makes the watch? Can you explain it? I can understand taking a risk for something great. But the risk has to contain the possibility to win something! Otherwise it's no risk, but stupidity! And Peter isn't stupid! There has to be something behind. After all I know the world. Your Peter isn't dying! He has no intention to do so. He can make you believe, but not me. May God want that you're right. God wants so, my child. Believe me, God wants it. Schedel, Behaim - come down! You have no business there! We're defending the honor of Nuremberg. The honor of Nuremberg stands in the pillory. Not this woman. You, Max! Why do you let them tease you? Is that legal? To turn pillory into a carnival's joke? The citizens are requested to watch the spectacle. I'm glad that you came as well, Pankraz. But of course, Ev. They are mocking the church! The church isn't mocked when people help each other. Dear mother ... She is speaking! Hey! She is speaking! I did hear it. Won't you stop a heretic's wife from mocking you? Ev! I'm just with me. It's forbidden to speak! Don't cause me any trouble. He belongs to the pole! The fat guy! I knew it before. One has to go with the times, Weihrauch. Those means are used up! The people hate those means. And don't believe in those, who are using them. If I were allowed to, I would stand beside her as well. Bravo, Sixtus! Well, well. Are you crazy? When I get you, charlatan! Violence! Violence! Church boy! Fat pig! Stop it! When the time comes, the church is only half full. That are the fruits of Martin Luther. God in Heaven, my Peter. Five years prison. And five years loss of honor. They don't make it easy for you. I can't change it. At least ... I made it. The worst thing is that I can't go home. I think it's for the best when you give up to the court. No, no. I don't know how many days I've left. I don't want to spend them in prison. I'll go to my mother. They won't search for me there. And you, you're getting me Schedel. I'll notice Ev. Can you still walk? Can I get you a carriage? - I feel better than ever. I think I got lucky. Then God did listen to my prayers. Where is Ev? In church. So? Praying for me as well? No. She is rehearsing with the church choir. The cantor demanded that she sings at the church festival. They threatened and finally almost forced her. Now Ev is thinking she will help you with it. Are you still allowed to sing in church ... ... when you were punished at the pillory? Just because of it! The church didn't excommunicate her. The church ... But my watch is finished. Someone is coming! Only Schedel. I'm in the chamber. Send him in. Peter! In the chamber! And Ev is not here! Shall I get her? Yes, Konrad. But take care that nobody sees you! Wait till Ev comes. No. I feel ... ... it's coming with giant steps. But I was expecting it. Then it may come. Schedel! How much time do I have left? No time. Well, then. Good. If a good citizen dies ... ... he puts his house in order. Mother! You fell out with Schedel. Give him your hand! Schedel! Give her your hand. And that is forever. I hope. Behaim. Write! All I have ... ... belongs to Ev ... ... and my mother ... ... in equal shares. The watch too. I don't want that the watch ... ... is sold with great profit. I decree ... ... that on my invention will rest no copyright. I forbid that my ... father-in ... ... that the father of my wife ... ... is allowed to any business connected with it. Because I know him. Konrad ... ... shall in Nuremberg ... ... and Augsburg ... ... and in Munich ... Munich! Yes, Munich. And in all the big cities of the Reich ... ... shall he teach how such watches are made. Behaim ... ... will get the first 10 watches. I thank God that you, Behaim, have given me the assignment. Ev! I don't know whether I can take it ... ... but I'd like to ... ... die up there on the castle. Not here in this room. It's so cramped. I want to be high up over Nuremberg. Where I made my watch. Peter! Peter! Don't scream. Don't scream. Ev! Just come ... ... closer. Behaim. I want to show it to you. Give Konrad ... ... the hand. Konrad ... ... give Ev ... ... the hand. I have to make up ... ... for a debt ... ... with you ... Ev. That's ... ... forever. I hope. Peter! Don't oppose. I know what I'm doing. If I look out ... ... of my heaven's window ... ... I want to see you happy. Because ... ... I love you. Until ... ... all eternity. My heart ... ... stops beating. But ... ... it will tick on. In millions ... ... not yet made ... ... parts. Let it roll! Let it roll! From Nuremberg ... ... into the whole world. We ... ... Emperor Maximilian ... ... of the house of Hapsburg ... .. take with the means of mercy ... ... the serious punishment ... ... from master locksmith Peter Henlein. We return to him his civil rights. Furthermore we award him ... ... the title honorary citizen of the free city of Nuremberg. In gratitude, city and Reich lower ... ... their flags in front of their great gates ... We command that his body ... ... is to be buried with the highest honors we have to give. * subs by Amedee *
