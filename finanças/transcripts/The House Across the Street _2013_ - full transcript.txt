Uh... Actually... Coming! - Hey. - Hi. I think... Yeah, it's dry. Yeah, so, um... I wanna offer you the apartment. Really? Oh, cool. I love it. Good. Yeah, I thought you did. So you'll take it? - Yeah, yeah. - Oh, good. Great. That's good. I'll go get you the lease. - Will you take cash? - What's that? Cash? Um, yeah. I mean, it's a little unusual, but I... Yeah, yeah, I'll take cash. Cool. Yeah, I'll take anything right now. Hold on. I'll get the... Hold on. I'll just put on here that you paid... in cash. Here you go. What brings you to this small town? I... I just... - Want a fresh start? - Yeah, yeah. Just had to get out of there, you know? Yeah, I know. I guess my references checked out. - No? - Well, I didn't... I really didn't have to check them. I just met you, and it felt right. I, um, I don't know. I guess I trust you. Okay. I mean, I think you're just perfect. You're exactly what I was looking for. So I have other properties that I run. I got three other places, so I won't be around here much. - Okay. - But if you ever need anything, my number's right here. You've got my number. - Yeah. - Um, just call. - Okay, thanks. - Yeah, of course. Oh. It's yours. Welcome home. Hi. What's up? What? A truck? The truck with all my stuff in it? Did you lock it? Get out here! Come out! Bring her! I'm not afraid of you! Come out! I am not afraid of you! I wanna see my daughter now! Hey! Hey, what are you doing? What happened? Oh, my God. That's her mother. Who? Oh, boy. I knew her. We gotta call an ambulance. Whose mother? Listen, you stay here. I'm gonna go get the ambulance. Hey, you wanna get off the street? What? You're standing in the middle of the street. You're gonna look into this, right? All I have is someone who thinks they saw a hit-and-run. You still have to report it. You said you were inside when it happened, so you didn't actually see what happened. What, she just fell and hit her head? If I have any further questions, I know where to find you. Oh, hi. I'm new. I just moved in across the street. Oh! Oh, you must be the new tenant. Well, welcome to the neighborhood. So I guess you live here? No, no, no. I live down at the end of the street... uh, cul-de-sac. Well, who lives here then? I mean, I'm just wondering. I just moved here. Well, somebody lives there. But you know, actually, I don't know if they do. They're almost never around. I gotta get down there to the bus stop, pick up my kids. My name is Ned. Someone got run over. A lady. There was an old man. He said it was someone's mom. Is that so? Well, I gotta go. Um, what was your name? Amy. Nice to meet you, Amy. Hey, sweetie. Hope things are good at on your end. And you're not gonna believe this, but they have to special order that truck part. They said a few days, more or less, but don't worry about it. I have a little surprise for you tonight. All right, I'll call you later. Oh, crap. Good night, Bess. You all set? Hey, baby. Baby, it's me. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to scare you. Joey, you bastard! Jeez! I'm sorry! Don't call me "baby." What? Come on! I'm a joker. You know me. You scared me. I'm... I'm sorry, okay? I apologize. You could've told me you were coming. I did tell you. I left you a message. I said I was gonna bring you a surprise. It's me. I brought your stuff. Sorry. Just... I shouldn't have accepted your offer to help me to move. Hey, it's not that big of a deal. It's all right. How did you get in here? It was unlocked. I figured you were already here. Don't do that. I'm just looking. "The area of Iguazu Falls, where the countries of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay meet, is one of the best places in the world to see butterflies in large variety and number." - Why'd you underline that? - Give me the book. That's a beautiful butterfly. It's poisonous. What are you doing? There was a car, guy going to that house. You gotta be kidding me. There's something weird going on over there. What is so weird about a guy coming home in the middle of the night? It's not his house. So we're playing cops now? I'm arresting you for disturbing the peace. What are you doing up anyway? You woke me up, and I'm charging you with domestic disturbance. Just don't get carried away. All right, I'm sorry. I still feel for you, okay? Joey, this is what's best for me, okay? I'm sorry you got caught up in the middle of the whole... Amy, listen. Baby, look at me. Look at me. You need to forget about that trial, okay? Hello! Who are you? I'm sorry. I'm Amy, the new tenant. Oh, yeah. You're the new tenant. Oh, my. Mary's in intensive care. They don't think she will live. Who's Mary? You know, it's a shame. You just moved here, and you had to see that. Nothing like that ever happens here. I know. I'm already liking it so much. It's so quiet and peaceful here. It's really... You'll really like it. It's nice. It's... Nothing happens here. It's quiet. Nice and quiet. And a dead-end street. Yeah. So you know everyone on the street? Yeah. Where are you from? I'm Sam. Sam Barnes. Oh, hi. Amy. Yeah. You just moved here? I'm moving here from Kansas. Oh, Kansas. I was there once. I didn't like it very much. Boring. Nothing to do out there. So do you know who lives in that house? No, I'm sorry. I can't quite remember. See, my memory isn't what it used to be. So you don't know them? No, no. Oh, my wife. She wants you to come over and have lunch. I told her all about you, and she wants to meet you. Okay, I will, I promise. Oh. Excellent. So who's Mary? Hey, how you doing? Ohh! Are you all right? Hi. Yeah, I'm fine. Why? You're bleeding. I just fell. I'm fine. Gonna go clean it up. Well, come on over later if you want to. I want you to meet my wife and kids. - Okay. - You promise? Yeah. All right. Now sit back, girls. Come on! I thought this was a 24-hour store. The store is 24 hours, the pharmacy isn't. They close at 9:00 for safety reasons. Actually, that's our pharmacist. Phil? Good night. See you tomorrow. She wants to talk to you about the pharmacy. - Come back tomorrow. - I can't! I need these refilled. It's important. You've exceeded the prescribed dosage. They're antipsychotics! Do you know how important those are? I'm sorry. I... I just really need them. No. Look, you'll have to see a doctor about this. I'm sorry. I just can't have this hanging over my head. I'm sorry. No. License and registration, please. What'd I do? Ran a red light back there. Step out of the vehicle, ma'am. By the trunk for me. Here you go. I'm gonna let you off with a verbal warning. I'm new here. I just... Which is why it's a verbal warning. Thanks. Nice neighborhood you live in. I grew up there. Yeah, it's really quiet and peaceful. Yeah, we like to keep it that way. - Who's Mary? - Mary? I'm just wondering. There's nothing to worry about. Is it the lady that was run over? You playing detective? No, I'm not trying to. I'm just... Like I said, people around here keep to themselves. Sorry. Hello, Amy. Come right in. Make yourself at home. Thanks. Hey, kids, Amy's here! - Hi. - Hi. Okay, we got Tommy, Sally, and Kendra. And my wife's around here somewhere. There she is. This is my wife Jenny. - Hello. Amy, isn't it? - Yeah. Welcome to the neighborhood. Smells good in here. The kids just made some cookies. Do you want some? Oh, no, no. I'm addicted. One or two isn't going to hurt. Come on in. Cookies! Hey! Hey, hey! Let your sisters get in first! How long have you lived here? Oh, about 10 years, I guess. Has it always been like this? How do you mean? Quiet, peaceful. Yeah, right. I saw what happened. You saw what? Your kids. You know what I'm talking about. So it isn't always quiet and peaceful. No, you're wrong. It is. - Nothing happens if... - If? Uh... They don't bother us, and we don't bother them. Let's put it that way. Well, then who's Mary? Well, uh, I'm sorry to bother you, but, um... I need to ask you to stop what you're doing. What am I doing? Please. For the sake of my children, my family. Just tell me what's going on. - I can't. I really can't. - Why? 'Cause it'd be opening up a whole new... It's just something that you would be much better off not knowing about. I don't get it. Look, it's just not worth it, you know? - How do you know that? - I know. Look, I know they came after we... They came after we moved here, okay? Can you just tell me who Mary is? Mary's daughter went missing a few months ago and... I gotta go. I'll talk to you later. $100 for a freakin' plate search? It's public information. I have the right to know. I don't have that information available right now. - What, did it just disappear? - No, it didn't just disappear. I'll just have to go look for it. You gonna go now? I don't have that information available. I'm sure it's just sitting on a shelf back there! If it would save you some time, I can just look for it myself. No one's permitted behind the counter. Dick! Are you fu... I can't believe this is happening to me! Um, everything all right, ma'am? What do you mean? We got a call of an individual causing a disturbance down at City Hall. God! What is it with this town? Excuse me? Nothing. I'm sorry. What's gonna happen to me? Um, nothing. I'm just checking you out. License and registration, if you don't mind. Do I have to? I'm just doing my job, ma'am. You just sit tight, all right? All right, here you go. Now, um... I know, I know. It's a small town. Everyone knows everyone. Keep to myself. I'm sorry, what? Nothing. Sorry. You wanna tell me what you were doing back there? I was trying to find out who lives across the street from me. The clerk was giving me a hard time. It's supposed to be public information. Well, it's a small town. People take forever to warm up to newcomers. You're not from here either? I moved here, so I know just as well as anybody how hard it is to get things done. I'll tell you what. You give me the address, I'll find out for you. That means I'd have to give you my phone number. Well, yeah, I mean... You don't have to. I was just, I was offering, you know, to be friendly. I was trying to... Just trying to help. I'll tell you what. I'll text it to you. I'll look for your text. All right. You have a nice day. Come on. Come on. Find my phone. Yes! Yes! How many times are you gonna embarrass me like this? Driver's license and registration, please. Did you forget where I lived? We're being watched. Just give it to me now. Don't do that! I texted you. You didn't get my messages? My phone kinda got away from me for a little bit. Just stay there. Yell at me or something. Look angry. I can't believe you're writing me a ticket! I found out who owns the house. It belongs to a Mr. Samuel Barnes. Not the house next door. The house across the street. He owns the house across the street. What? They're old people. Did you or did you not ask me to find out? You're welcome, by the way. Thanks, I guess. Listen, just tell the town you can't read my writing. That'll let you off. And remember, you're being watched. Yes? Hi. Uh, my wife wants to know if you can come over. Well, that's great news. Can you come over and have lunch with us? Now? Can you come over tomorrow? Right, right, naturally. Yeah. I told her you were from Utah. She never met anybody from Utah. I'm from Kansas. Yeah. Can you come over tomorrow for lunch? Well, I'll let you know, okay? Oh, that's excellent. Excellent. I'll, uh... I'll tell my wife you're coming over tomorrow for lunch. That'll make her happy. Bye-bye. Just keep reading. Don't turn around. What's going on? I'm getting stonewalled. I got busted trying to get the dirt on Barnes. He's got priors, but they're old. What was he arrested for? Why do you want to know? You want to tell me what's going on? It's the house across the street from me. There something really bad going on there. What makes you think so? I just know. Besides, there's always cars going there at night, but never during the day. That's not exactly illegal. - So who owns the car? - What car? The plates I gave you. I know that you looked them up. You're a cop. They belong to a known felon. He's dangerous. You stay away from him. He's the real deal. - What's he a felon for? - A lot of things. Armed robbery, extortion, racketeering. Look, just lay low for a while until I can... find out what's going on, okay? So who busted you? Your favorite cop. He's my boss. I'll just have to do it when he's not around. But there something you can do. Yeah? Yeah. I want you to keep watching that house. Text me the details. Plates, descriptions, everything. Tell me about Mary. Mary who? The woman that was hit. The hit-and-run. You know what I'm talking about. She's dead. Have you got a moment? We need to talk. About what? I have nothing to say. Your foot says otherwise. You didn't file a hit-and-run. I learn fast, don't I? What were you doing in that neighborhood? That is a dangerous spot. I got lost. What makes you think I was run over? Small town. Everyone's on the same frequency. It was an accident. Try again. Listen, since I didn't break any laws, I don't think I'm obligated to talk to you. We can't help you, young lady, if you don't help us. You're not here to help me. Phil mentioned you to me the other day. Phil who? The pharmacy. He supposed to keep that confidential. He thinks you're abusing your prescription. And what business is that of yours? They're antipsychotics. What's going on? Trying to play detective? I hear Mary died. What about it? Makes it a homicide, doesn't it? You trying to tell me how to do my job? Don't tell me you don't know about Daisy. Daisy is a little girl that went missing a few months ago, and that's all there is to it. Except her mom went looking for her and got run over. How do you know? Small town. Everyone's on the same frequency. Hi, Amy. What happened? I'm fine. I just sprained my foot. Oh, that's awful. Do you need anything? No, it's okay. The doctor said it's gonna take two weeks. We'll bring you some food over tonight. We're just going to Tommy's game, and we'll be back tonight, and we'll bring you some food. You really don't have to. Nonsense. That's what neighbors are for. We'll see you tonight. Bark all you want, you stupid dog. No one's around to hear you. Daisy. - Get up. - Don't touch me. - Get up! - Don't touch me! Get up! Get up! Get up! I'm gonna get you out, okay? Come on, come on. Come on. Get up. Get up. Get up. You poor thing. You're all doped up. Who did this to you? Can you talk to me? Please talk to me. I'm here to help you. It's gonna be okay. I'm right here. Tell me who did this to you. Hello? How long has it been going on? Don't point that gun at me. It's dangerous. Come on. Can you just... Can you just put it down? Please? That girl back there, that's Daisy. Those cars that were coming at night, they're clients. What? Don't lie to me. I know what I saw. They're clients. She's a slave. Listen, when I came here... Stay right there! Come on, please? Don't be stupid. - Were you ever a client? - Oh, Jesus, no. There's only one way to find out. You seen him before? You're about to undo two years of police work! Now, please... Stay out of the house. Okay? It's so very easy for them to just shut down, move somewhere else, abduct another girl and start again, and then we'll never find them. Why so long? 'Cause I don't know who the big fish is. Yes, we do. It's that felon. He's just the protection they hired. So you know him? I told you to stay away from him. We spook him, it'll barely dent the ring. But they'll shut down. Who else is involved? Look, I started snooping around here about a year ago, and every time I get close, they just shut down, so I don't know. It probably goes over my head 'cause every time I get close, they're gone. - Is it Peterson? - I don't know. What about Ned? Those people got problems of their own. They don't care. Ned's no exception. So while you were taking your time with your police investigation, that girl was getting it again and again. Listen, you're my ace in the hole. Why you think I keep pulling you over? I don't have an excuse to be here. You do. You live here. You can do surveillance 24/7. I can't. So just get me those plates, descriptions, whatever you can. One of them's gonna be the big fish, and then we'll shut this thing down for good, okay? Does that work for you? Do you want the big fish or not? If you cause any more problems, we're never gonna get him. Can you understand that? I gotta get out of here before someone makes my car. We can't be seen together again. What about that felon? What's his name? They call him Scratch. He's been in jail for some pretty bad stuff. I don't want you near him. Okay? I'm sorry I hit you. It's all right. Let's just get the big guy, okay? Hey, Joey, I can't really talk right now. Hey, can I borrow another hundred bucks from you? Thanks. You don't take direction well, do you? Did I or did I not tell you to stop going by the house? Listen, man. I don't listen. I talk. Stay away from that place. This is the last time you'll see me. The next time you won't see anything. You'll just be dead. Oh, you bastards. Hey, look, Ma. Someone's making a scary movie. Oh, my God! Oh, look, it's Miss Detective. Harassing me for helping my grandfather out. He is? Is he okay? Just a sprained back. Going straight to bed. He's gonna stay there for a while. Well, can he talk? I need to talk to him. No more playing detective. He needs to stay quiet. That's the girl from Utah. She's a good girl. Thought you taught us not the point at people. My wife wants to know when you're coming over for lunch. When are you coming? I will soon. Where's his wife? At the food store. That's enough pointing for one day, Gramps. Don't want any more red lights. I'll be over soon, okay? Shit! Hey! I'm so sorry. I forgot to bring food over last night. Are you okay? You look tired. I'm fine. I can manage. No, nonsense. Let me bring you over some food. It's really okay. I have to go to work next week. - I have a lot of things to do. - I'll come by tonight. - Okay. - All right, wonderful. Scratch is dead. What? I just hope they're not shutting it down by wrapping up the loose ends. Killing him means one less to turn government's witness. God. Why would they kill him? We don't know they did, but... But? Well, it happened after you took the girl. So maybe, maybe not. Who knows? Maybe they think he took her or he was messing around with them. I can't do this anymore. We need to go to the police or... We don't know, okay? It might have been a drug deal gone bad. God knows he was involved in some pretty bad shit. We want the big fish, don't we? I really didn't know anyth... Hey, you gonna let me inside? This is not a good time. Who do you got staying with you? Nobody. You got a warrant? I didn't think so. What do you want? You met Officer Thaxter, right? Kyle Thaxter? Who? What's he up to? What are you talking about? What was he doing here? Why the hell are you harassing me? I'm just doing my job. I don't think I can help you. We don't seem to get anywhere, do we? Now you're getting it. Anything else? I'm gonna find out who's up there, so you might as well just tell me. If you couldn't get a warrant to search my place, that means whatever you're doing is not legit. Stop harassing me, or I'll call your chief. What's the matter? Are you okay? Shit, that's Ned. I'll be right back. I'm sorry my wife couldn't come. She's back home with the kids. But we brought you pie and casserole and the lot. You're too kind. I would've come earlier, but I saw that Officer Peterson was here. Yeah, he's pretty popular. Um, I wouldn't say that. I think he's involved with what's going on. It's possible. So you know what's going on over there? Listen, we all just go to bed at a certain time around here. Look the other way, you mean? You don't give a shit that that girl's mom is dead? The fact is, I've got a house, and I've got a family, and I've got children to look after, so it's not that simple for me. Can you please understand that their welfare is more important to me? The part that I don't understand is why the hell does that house belong to Barnes. I mean, I know he has nothing to do with it. It's really none of my business. How could you not care? I mean, you must know something about what's going on there. I really don't. Just keeps getting more and more confusing. The trick is just to go to bed at a certain time. It's like you won't even know it's happening. I got it! Look, I love my family, and for their sake, everything stays the same way it is. Can you understand? I'm not gonna be able to count on you. I'm sorry. Anything else, just let me know. - Kyle! - Yes, sir? Yeah, I'd like to have a word with you. What about? Scratch shooting, other side of town. What's that to do with me? Something came up. What do you mean? Yeah, ballistics just called me. They have a pretty good indication where the bullets came from, so I've requested a test on everyone's weapon just to be sure I'm not singling you out. I know what you're trying to do. Tell you what. I'm being courteous right now, but I want your weapon here tomorrow. I don't care what your excuse is. Is that understood? I guess I'm getting closer, aren't I? Is that understood? Yes, sir. Officer Peterson, come in. Officer Peterson, come in. Officer Peterson, are you there? We have the results from the ballistics test. We identified the owner of the gun. Officer Peterson? The answer's no, you can't talk to my grandfather. What's bugging you? I'm just wondering about the house across the street. - That's all. - The house he rents out? What? Something wrong? Who rents it? My grandfather. I'm confused. Sam Barnes is your grandfather? I think you knew that already. You guys have different last names. My grandmother remarried. What's so hard to understand about that? Why does he own that house? He used to live there before he married my grandmother. Now he rents it. Speaking of which, I gotta go collect the rent. I hate that. Why? Friendly dog and they have. So you know them? Not personally. I don't like them, but they pay. I gotta go over before I forget. Just who is renting it? Playing detective again, are we? Give me a break. Oh, my God. What are you doing here? I brought the rest of your stuff. You're welcome. It's the wrong time. You know, what is your problem? It's just the wrong time. You've been having your nightmares again, right? Says who? I don't know. Says the bags under your eyes. It's none of your business. Why are you doing this? Stop running, okay? Just stop! Go get help. Do something. Let me help you, for Christ's sake. You have dreams. I don't. Amy? You gave me a scare. Took me a while to figure it out. Sometimes I can be so dense. My mind just phases out, you know? I don't understand. You see, ever since I moved into that place, I've been taking down the license plates of all the cars that have gone there. I've taken pictures of every one. The one thing that keeps bothering me is... when those clients come, there's always someone at home. There's always someone there to let them in, and that someone didn't drive there because I never saw that happen. So it must be someone that lives close by, someone that could just walk there at any time. Come on, are you saying that you think that's me? And then it came to me. Amy, I don't appreciate you coming into my house... Remember that day that you yelled at your kids for kicking their soccer ball into that house? You didn't want them anywhere near that place. Of course not. Your stupid mistake. When you went and got the ball, you know what happened? Nothing. I got the ball, and I got out over there. Exactly. But the big dog back there... Yeah? Yeah? When I went back there, that dog was barking so loud. Today when Harry went back there to get the rent check, that dog was barking its ass off. But when you went back there, you know what happened? - Amy, put the gun down. - Nothing. Do you know what that means? Amy, put the gun down. The dog knows you. What, are you crazy? It's you, isn't it? You're the one having everyone eat out of your hands. The mayor, the police chief. God knows who else. I saw them all there. I ran all their plates. What, are you trying to kill me? That's how I know where Peterson lives. Cost me 100 bucks, but it was well worth it. Am I right? Am I right? No. Don't lie to me. Tell me the truth. Is that what you want to hear? Why do you do this filthy thing? What filthy thing? I just want to grow old in my house with my wife and my family. That's it! Guess what. You're not getting any older. Get on your knees. - What? - Kneel! What is this? You got my gun. Thought Scratch had it. Hands on your head, fingers interlaced. - Why are you doing this to me? - I think you know. Come on! I'm a police officer. You were a regular client until someone, maybe Ned, grabbed you by the balls when he found out you're a cop. Oh, come on. No, no, no! You were there, remember? When you asked the girl if she'd seen me. I was protecting her. I told her that if she'd seen you before, to shake her head no. You killed Scratch. It's you that killed him. You killed Scratch, Peterson, and Ned. You killed Ned? When they run the ballistic test, they're gonna find out that those bullets came from your gun. You stupid... Why would I do that? Do you happen to know why I moved here? Huh? Why I moved here. Why I moved east. No. I was one of those girls. I was kidnapped. I was gang raped. It happened to me too. I went through everything. The pain, the trouble. I went to trial, and I testified against everyone. Threw the case out. Mistrial. And now you're the judge. No chance of mistrial. Just go on and get it over with, you bitch. I'm sorry. I really hate doing that. It scared the shit out of me when that girl disappeared. Never thought that I'd find her right underneath my nose. All right. Here. You know what? You're starting to become a real pain in my ass. Yeah. You're just... perfect. You know, no offense. This isn't personal. I mean, I wouldn't even be doing this if I wasn't in the situation that I'm in. I'm just providing for me and my family, that's all. And you have no idea how valuable you are. That's how you find the girls. Yeah, that's right. It's really easy, actually. I mean, they come to me. I just screen them, take my pick. Now this is gonna lower your resistance a little. You won't remember a thing. You picked the wrong one. Amy, what do you want me to do, huh? What do you want me to do? Just tell me what's the right thing. You want me to call the cops? 'Cause I will. Guy told me that we could walk away from this place. We could go wherever you want. Just me and you, baby. What did you do? You bastard! God, you are such a prick! Why are you always getting in the way? You kids, get going! Get out of here before everybody gets here! I'll take care of this. What? Get out now! Give me the gun, Dad. Get back in the house. Oh, you son of a bitch. I don't blame you for what you tried to do to me. I deserved it. We all did. Hey, I think I should go to the hospital. I'm bleeding pretty bad here. Hey! That Kyle's gun? You know what? That works. Dispatch? Dispatch, this is Peterson. Dispatch, you there? I'm off duty, but I have a 10-17. I want a code two. I was fired upon. What the hell are you doing? Repeat, 10-17, 10-17. I have located suspect who fired at me yesterday. I have a 10-45. Hey, I-I pay you to look the other way. Don't you think it's gone on far enough? You take advantage of an old man to move in and set up shop? Come again? Officer Peterson, come in. Yes, 10-45, code one. Repeat, 10-45, code one. Suspect is... dead. Come on. You're not gonna kill me. I got you by the balls, okay? Don't you forget that. I'm just a small-town cop. Jesus Christ. What about Romeo? He's in love with her. He won't do anything. Don't worry. It's just as sedative. No, baby, no. They did it to me when they first took me. - You'll be all right. - I love you. Where I'm going, you can't go. No. But I love you... No. I'm broken, Joey. I can't love anymore. Stop following me. Move on with your life. Don't look for me. Don't look for me. Don't mess up the prints on it. Put that gun down. You knew who it was the whole time, and you never told me. As long as you didn't know, he wouldn't have done anything to you. Were you gonna let him abduct me too? I was never far off. Right. Your dad. Always watching. He's my stepdad. Always getting us in trouble. He didn't have any kids, did he? Just a city kid with a slick operation. You know I wasn't a client. Put that gun down. Put it down! When were you gonna stop it? I made a mistake. Are you gonna kill everybody who makes a mistake? Why should I trust you? I don't know. I don't have an answer. Please put that gun down. I'm sorry. I'm sorry too. Why? Why did you have to do that?
