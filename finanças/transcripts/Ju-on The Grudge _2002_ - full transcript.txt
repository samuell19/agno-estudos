Did you miss school today? No Problem. I've got all the credits I need. - Okay. - More important, what happened? I don't really understand it too well myself. Was Hirohashi asking too much of you again? And you couldn't say no? Yeah. You're not the one that should be nursed! Thank you Mariko. I'll go buy something to drink. So that was the first time you'd been there? Yes. The first time. And the child you say you saw at that house... Did you find him? No. Not yet. Toshio... What? I'm sure he said his name was Toshio. Toshio? Ms. Nishina, the Tokunagas don't have any children. What? But... then what about that photograph? There should have been a family picture in the house. That wasn't a photo of the Tokunagas. Then who was it? We're investigating it now. Mr. Detective... did something happen there? Excuse me. Before the Tokunaga family... other families and relations that lived in that house have died or disappeared. All of these? What about the sister of Katsuya Tokunaga? We haven't had contact. And a security guard in the building where she works is dead. And... please look at this. Husband Takeo Saeki killed his wife Kayako there. Later, Takeo was found dead on a nearby road by a neighbor. Kayako Saeki. Twenty eight at the time. Housewife. She and Takeo had one son between them. "Toshio." Regarding where Kayako's murdered body was found... alas it was up there in the attic. "Slaughter, Death in Attic..." Daddy! Welcome home. I'm home, Izumi. Where's Mommy? She went shopping. - Is that so. - Yeah. - If you don't get home, she'll be angry again. - It's Okay. Come over here. Huh? What? Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! What is it? Look at this. Huh? What is it? - Did you draw those? - Yep! Um. This is the Prince of the Land of Angels. That's the Princess of the Land of Angels. And that's their baby. I see. And what's this? Are you Mr. Yuji Toyoma? I'm Igarashi of the Yahara Division. Ouch! What is it? It's regarding the Saeki investigation you used to head... I have some questions. Izumi. Head on home. Yeah. I quit a long time ago. Will you leave me alone? People have died in that house again. You're the only one left that I can talk to about that case. Izumi! What are you doing there? Did you clean the bath? What? Today is your turn, right? - Yeah, okay. - Hurry up. Is what you saw at the Tokunaga house... this child? Yes. Take a good look. There's no mistake? Yes. It's him. Did you find him? No. This boy went missing five years ago and has never been found. If he were alive somewhere today, he'd be 11 years old. Huh? Mr. Nakagawa. This is Mr. Yuji Toyama. Oh. He was in charge of that case... Thank you very much. Yes. I'm Nakagawa. Come in. Hitomi Tokunaga, younger sister of Katsuya Tokunaga who lived in that house. After this, she disappeared at home. Someone in her building witnessed her come home. Get it. They found Hirohashi's body. The man who found Rika is dead. What? Mr. Toyama. Yes. Please wait a moment. Yes. Izumi. You're a cowardly chicken! Hey, what's this? Sake. What's this doing here? Wow! Awesome. What a house! This is not sake. What'll we do? I'm going home! Wait! There's no problem! You're running out on us? Izumi! She is such a coward. But you know, that's the way she is. And you know, these days she hangs with Chiharu. No good. She hasn't returned home. Where could she have gone? What'll we do? Did she really go home? I can't believe it. Hey, Ayano. Look from there. Yeah. Hey! She's there! She's by the gate. She looks deep in thought. She's that scared. Maybe she's paranormal. She didn't have to run away! Downer. Yeah. What was that? What? What's wrong? Izumi really went home. What? Mr. Toyama. Mr. Toyama! Mr. Nakagawa! Mr. Toyama! Mr. Toyama! Let me out! Get a grip! A grip! Mr. Toyoma! What happened! No! No! No! I'm scared! "Izumi." What's today's first hour? Wasn't it English? That means Sekine from the morning! - The worst. - The worst. Don't you think he speaks weird English? It's weird. The pronunciation is probably all wrong. - Yeah. - Yeah. Is it comprehensible? Like, "can you really speak English?" - Yeah. It's a bit much. - Totally. Izumi? Izumi? What? Oh. What's wrong? No. Nothing. "Searching for Missing Friends." Isn't this Izumi? No it's not. Izumi, find it? I don't know yet. Look. You're here. Oh yeah. - Hey. Move! - Owl. Many thanks. Hey Teach! Yeah. What is it? Toyama? What's wrong? There's not one photo with Izumi in it. What's going on here? That's impossible. Did you really look? It's not there. We checked over and over. Right? Is that right. I'll have the negative checked. Can you wait a little longer? Bye. - What's a little longer? - Ouch ouch ouch. Stop pulling. - Don't you feel sorry for Izumi? - It's going to stretch. It'll take about a week. Why's it take so long? I'm busy! A woman's body has been found in the attic of a deserted house in Nerima Ward. The body has been identified as that of previously missing... Rika Nishina. A 23 year-old welfare nurse. As no marks were found on the body... Here. Thanks. You're late! Don't blame me! We're about to go to Izumi's. Let's see. I'll come with you. Hey! Teacher doesn't have to come. Bye. We'll return it tomorrow for sure. I'll leave Toyama to you. Come on. Let's see! - No! - What? We'll see them with Izumi. Wait, but... - Hurry, let's go. - What's inside? You're Izumi's friends? Izumi? It's Chiharu. Miyuki is here too. The photos are done so we brought them. Can we come in? Isn't it a little dark? Yeah. Don't! Izumi. What's happened? Izumi? The three of them... look in. That's why. What? What three? Saori and the rest. When the three disappeared... I was with them. Why didn't you... I was scared! Scared of what? The day we came back from the school trip... Saori started saying... "there's a haunted house nearby. Let's go." Haunted house? Where could something like that be? I can't remember! Wait. Why? That's not possible! I wanted to! Izumi! What's going on? Please tell us. It was strange even before we went in. The place felt strange. Izumi, were you paranormal? I don't have any sort... It's nothing like that. You two must not go near. Saori and the others were having fun but... I didn't want to stay there. I left that house alone. I was so scared I ran away by myself. That's why. Saori and them were left there... Izumi! Get a hold of yourself! Izumi! Get a hold of yourself! Izumi! Get a hold of yourself! Close it! Close it! Just close it! Close it'll! That's what my husband was like before he died. In the same way, he sealed all the windows. Does Izumi know about that? I haven't told her anything. Oh, the photographs. What is this? "Searching for Missing Friends." No! Chiharu! Who are you? Daddy. That time... I saw you Daddy. "Kayako." Yes hello? Hey Mariko! Long time no see! Yeah. Yeah. What's going on? Yeah. I see. That's really rough. Peek-a-boo! Peek... a-boo! Peek... Tomorrow? Sure, no problem. Yeah. Yeah. I understand. Yes. I'll see you. Okay. Mr. Saito. Sorry to keep you waiting. Mr. Saito, I heard you're going to have a great grand-child. Peek-a-boo! Peek... a-boo. Mr. Saito? Peek-a-boo. Thank you. Rika! Mariko! How have you been? What? Did you change your hair? I cut it. So cute! I think around Sunday. Well? Sunday? Sunday is alright. - Really? - Yeah. There just happened to be two tickets inside. "Please take Ms. Nishina." Really? What? Rika, you liked Toyoshima your senior year didn't you? Huh? Rika, it's so easy to read your face. Welcome. This is the menu. Please let me know when you've decided. There's already one problem kid in my new class. Really? He hasn't come to school once. What do you think? And his parents? I can't contact them. That's the problem. I see. But don't you think there's a reason? But don't you think they could at least contact me? At this rate, I won't finish my home visits. That's right, home visits. All the other classes have finished. I'm the only one left. Is that right. What? Mariko, you've turned into a real teacher. What about you, Rika? I wonder. I can't really tell... What happened? I just felt something... Rika? Rika? Are you okay? Hey Rika? Hey Rika! Rika!! Rika, what's the matter? Are you alright? Yeah... Hello. This is Nishina. Hello Rika? Oh, Mariko? I'm sorry about today. You scared me all of a sudden. Are you all right now? Yeah. I really have to thank you. I'm sorry I ruined your day off. No. Don't worry about me. Where are you? Remember the kid that hasn't shown up in school? I came to his house. Yeah. The thing is, the boy is here. The parents haven't come home. I've been waiting for nearly an hour. Hey Mariko. Where is that? Huh? Hello? Hello Rika? Hello? Hey, Rika? Toshio? Toshio? Toshio? Toshio? Toshio? Are you there? Mariko!! Mariko. Mariko? Mariko? Mariko. Mariko! Mariko!! No. No. No. No. No!
