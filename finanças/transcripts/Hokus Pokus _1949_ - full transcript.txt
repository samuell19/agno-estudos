I'll knock your brains out. Hurry up. Okay, don't be-- Line 'er up. I got it. There it is. Okay. "Here this week" [MOE READS ON-SCREEN TEXT] MANAGER: Fine, fine, but business has been generally bad. You got a great act, Svengarlic. But if you could pull some stunt that would make the front pages of the newspapers, we'd do a land off this business. For instance, if you could hypnotize somebody to walk on water or make 'em do a dance up there on the flagpole of that insurance building, then you've got something. You've got a great idea, all right. But I've gotta find the right person to hypnotize. Let me think. Hey, wait a minute. I got an idea. You? Yeah. Maybe Svengarlic can hypnotize Mary and make her walk. MOE: Aw, that hypnotism stuff is the bunk. I'll bet I can hypnotize you and make you do anything. [LAUGHS] For instance, look me in the eye. Hokus pokus, pokus hokus, abracadabra. [FLITS] You are now in Los Angeles. [IN MONOTONE]: I am now in Los Angeles. You are now in New York. I am now in New York. You are now in Sing Sing. I am now in Sing Sing. You are now in Boston. I am now in Sing Sing. No, you're now in Boston! I am now in Sing Sing. You can't get this guy out of Sing Sing. Good. That's just where he belongs. Ha-ha. [CRASH] Oh! Oh! Oh! [IN NORMAL VOICE]: That's where he belongs, eh? I'll tear you limb from limb. Come on, stop this nonsense and let's get away from here. I'm sick and tired of this nonsense, so cut it out. I hope you numbskulls are convinced that this hypnotism is a fake. You are wrong, my friend. Look me in the eye, straight in the eye. In the eye. In the eye. Aside. Stay. You are now a cat. Let me hear you. [MEOWING] [FLITS] You are a monkey. Start monkeying. [MAKING MONKEY NOISES] [MEOWING] [HISSES] Stay. [NOISES STOP] You, over. MANAGER: Great. Great, Svengarlic. We're made. You're a sensation, man, a sensation. MAN [OVER LOUDSPEAKER]: Ladies and gentlemen, the great Svengarlic will now demonstrate the most amazing manifestation of hypnotism ever performed. Watch that flagpole on the insurance building across the street. You are still under my spell. Come out. Come out. Walk out on the flagpole. Walk. Walk. Stop. You will now start dancing. Dance. Dance. Dance. That's the way. Dance. [SHATTERS] MANAGER: Good grief! Svengarlic has been injured. Speak to me. Svengarlic, say something. The boys are up on the flagpole-- The boys. Hey, what's that crowd doing down there? [ALL YELPING] Let go of my legs. Let go of my legs. What, do you think I got wings? If you don't let go, I'll hit you with this flagpole. I'm slippin'. Shemp, hold still. I'll spit in my hands and get a new hold. I-- Whoa! [SCREAMS] [YELPS] [MUFFLED]: Oh, no! Help! [RIP] Ahh! Hey, Moe! What's goin' on? I feel a draft. Moe! Hey, Moe. Where are ya? You're inside out. [GRUNTING] Moe! Moe, don't move. [CROWD CHATTERING] How you doin'? Okay. You up? Oh. Ohh. [CRACKING] [ALL SCREAMING] [SHRIEKS] It's Mary. She's cured. She can walk. It's a miracle. Thank you, boys. Oh! You blithering idiots. Take it easy. Take it easy now. You imbeciles! [DINGS] [♪]
