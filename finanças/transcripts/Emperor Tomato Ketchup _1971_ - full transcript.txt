The conscious path of the transient nature of adult records is a mathematical law... ...analogous to the comprehensive path of continuous tradition. Mother, are you well? Father has just escaped the concentration camp. One dose of tobacco, and then it seems I will suffer. I yawn at the world. The Emperor yawns at the world. The section 'of the cat' in the encyclopedia is revised in the bathroom. For example, abolished is the four legged mammal definition. Cat... the hirsute expert of contemplation. Cat... the animal that cannot speak to children unless wearing boots. Cat... the carnivore what cannot be eaten. Cat... the non-writing detective novelist. Cat... the spy that wiretaps Berlioz's symphony. Cat... the hedonist with no property. Cat... the only political domestic animal, descendant of Machiavelli. 97th Provision: At times of simple flight, planned, or unplanned adult escape... ...the penalty is ten or more years hard labor.

The law has changed, so that cats... ...who do not wear boots are all to be slaughtered. So please do not let the kitty out on a moonlit night. The Emperor seems to have come to like cat steak. 11th provision: All subjects through faithful valor love their country. From Emperor and loyal sacrifice the rise of the Empire's glory both at home and abroad cannot be in doubt. It is not a question of children or men and women of different ages; everyone, for all time, must bow to the duty of obedience. Listen to that tune. The girl changed into a witch. Listen to that tune. The cat became smoke. Listen to that tune. Fanon has come to like Kirie. Listen to that tune. A person has come to love everyone. Listen to that tune. I would like to give to you. There is a sum total that has no relationship to history or mathematics. Therefore the mathematical certainty of natural law, Galileo Galilee?s astonishing view that nature is such that one can write of it... ...using the language of math; according to Kant... ...with the birth of correct natural science... ...the potential of the application of mathematical methods... ...to reach a truth is also born. Can you accurately speak the word vagina? VAGINA Today, from the police headquarters now situated outside... ...the Tomato Ketchup Occupied Zone, ...to all the un-occupied households nationwide this appeal... ...for cooperation with the following five items has gone out: 1. Do not allow children to watch TV, read newspapers, or listen to the radio. 2. Children must not be allowed to have edged tools, even for building. 3. Add the children's favorite food to dinner... ...one plate at a time, to gage the level of friendliness. 4. It is strictly forbidden for children to gather together... ...therefore, during this time, all schools are on vacation. 5. If possible, respect children, and never talk back to them. Furthermore, this evening the provisional government has... ...in emergency, revised the constitution to remove the child welfare laws... ...and dispatched the self defense forces. While the cat is napping, the child first learns of tobacco. While the cat is napping, the child's butt is strongly devoted to. While the cat is napping, the child experiences the prison of books. While the cat is napping, the Spanish civil war and the flower wilt. While the cat is napping, start the dynamite burning! While the cat is napping, Change the world! Change the world! Soldiers principal duty is to conquest. Soldiers of the Imperial troupe cannot break the rule. Soldiers must follow pleasure. Soldiers holds responsibility for the rise and fall of the Empire. The Emperor plays ken ball with the world. Mother, are you well? This will be the last letter I'm afraid. The Black Flag Party is on their way to capture you tomorrow. Please forgive this money grubbing un-filial betrayer of a son. But, you could not hide forever anyway, and no matter how it goes, we could never share our lives. I will buy a nice Buddhist altar, and place flowers every day. I will also decorate it with pictures. From now, if it goes well, I think you will be entered into the Kichigai hospital. Today, while the Emperor and I inspected it, I thought it might be good if you were at Kichigai. Mother, please stop this wasteful resistance. Please don't think badly of me. Goodbye. Someone will probably remember me. Friends gone, the former political world bullocksed... ...on the verge of becoming a brothel, this all disgusts me. To cry out toward the devil has disgorged hedonism. When the wings that support the bird propel it through the air... ...it is the surrounding air's resistance that gives the dynamic lift... ...this is the bird's loneliness and harmony. So I face the broken wall in my apartment... ...and try to work out a flying ornithopter machine that flaps like a bird. Maybe then I could fly. The theory of wings is hollow at its heart... ...it is the dynamic lift that holds one's salvation in the highest... ...in the highest, in the highest places one's eyes might open. Bird, Bird, Bicycle bird. As I fly I might see a dream of political power and rule. Oh yes, on that day, at that time, I will call out toward a phantom political pulpit. I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am! If you have a beard, you can have an Empire. Anyone who wears a beard becomes the Emperor. A cat is the Emperor of an Empire of darkness. A child is the Emperor of an Empire not yet complete. So it is that "World history is merely a haphazard point of view becoming reality... ...bringing a release from mandatory/necessary uniformity."
