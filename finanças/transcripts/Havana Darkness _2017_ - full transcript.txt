[glass shattering] Help me! Somebody, please... Help! Please... Please. [crying] Oh, no... Please. No, no, no, please! Please! ♪♪♪ [dripping] [siren wailing] [door bell ringing] [door bell ringing] Happy birthday, buddy! - You forgot your birthday again, didn't you? - I guess I did. Happy birthday, Carlos. I'm worried about you. Cheers! For Carlos! - Thank you, guys! - The guy that will always be older than me. Ugh! So you, uh... You finished this yet? Not even close. Productive night then, huh? Something like that, yeah. Hey why don't you, uh... get away a couple of days? Clear your head. Yeah I should probably do it, right? "Hemingway's Cuba". Theme's pretty self-explanatory. What's the problem? I don't know... The problem is... You know, in my head... I have, sorry, everything I want to say but... I don't know how to say it. Enlighten us. It's obviously about Hemingway and his life and work in Cuba. Which is your area of focus, right? I don't know, I'm missing something, you know? I'm just... I'm trying to find a hook to hang everything on. Why don't you just write something else? John! John! No... This is what I want to do. I've been working on this for a while. I don't know, I just... I've been thinking about going to Cuba and spend some time there. Why don't you? Yeah. I should probably do it, right? I would love to go to Cuba someday. Really? You never told me that. You never asked. Is your bathroom safe to use? It's the cleanest room in this apartment. Check it out. Oh so you were serious about this? Of course I'm serious about it. We've been dating forever. Well, congratulations! Don't pop the cork on the champagne bottle just yet. She hasn't said yes. But she will. Everybody knows that she likes you, she's in love with you. - You think? - Yeah. Come on. What's going on here? So what's the plan? Plan for what? Your birthday, dumbass! What are we doing? I don't know. Drinks, I guess. "Drinksh it ish." What time? You guys what us to do seven? So we'll see you at seven at Veryl? Veryl is fine. Seven at Veryl. Hey! - Don't be late! - Never late! - Don't be late! - I won't! - [Karen] Promise you won't be late! - I promise! [background siren] Can I help you? Yeah. Uh, I'm looking for Joshua. He's on vacation for a couple of weeks. Really? He didn't mention anything to me. And you are? I'm Carlos Carrasco. I'm Joshua's friend. Come here all the time. Oh, yes. Carlos. We've never met. Joshua did mention you though. - Frank. - Pleasure to meet you. Joshua asked me to look after his place while he's out of town attending some personal business. Nothing serious I hope. Mmm... I'm not entirely sure of the details myself. He did, however, say that you would be stopping by. - He did? - Mm-hm. In fact he left something for you. Please, follow me. Por favor. Joshua mentioned you are working on an essay. Something to do with Ernest Hemingway, right? Yeah. Well, he thinks this might be of benefit to you. - ¿Havana Darkness? - Mm-hm. - What is this? - Look for yourself. It's in Spanish. Most of phrasing and wording is very disjointed. Huh. My very same impression. Who's the author? Anonymous. But this is where it gets interesting. Joshua spoke to some guy from an auction where he picked this up. He was told that this belonged to his great uncle, Antonio Gattorno. - Antonio Gattorno. - Mm-hm. The manuscript came with a collection of letters. Here. Recognize the signature? Yeah. - That's... - Hemingway? Who knows. Antonio Gattorno was a Cuban artist and a very close friend of Hemingway. He actually moved to New York and spent over twenty years living in this city. Joshua said that this manuscript was part of a stack of books that were brought here from Cuba in the eighties. We strongly believe that this book was one of Hemingway's lost manuscripts. At least part of it anyway because it appears to be unfinished. See? "For him this place led to darkness... which led to pain... then to horror... horror so unspeakable that hung on him forever." Please, take it. No! No, I can't! I mean... If this is what you say it is it must be worth a fortune. As a matter of fact Joshua said that you might be interested in helping us with that. Absolutely! Yeah, of course, but... but I cannot take it with me. He insisted you take it. You sure? I'm sure. Actually I'm certain. Joshua will be back in a couple of weeks. I promise I'll take care of this, okay? If you talk to Joshua please tell him that I said thank you. I'll be sure to tell him that. [whistling imitating a siren] "He stood across the street from that building in Havana. The place was pure... evil. Nothing else. There was some..." [phone vibrating] - What's up? - [John] What's up?! It's eight fifteen and you are not here, that's what's up. Just give me twenty minutes, I'll be there. "Oh well, cash in their checks" and pays in freshman. What did he do? He took a swing! Why am I not surprised. Whose side are you on? So? How's your essay coming along? Good. Good. Actually, uh... Something came up today that might help a lot. Your table is ready. You guys remember Joshua, right? The guy who owns a bookstore. 83rd and York. Yeah, yeah, the sweet little thing. Yeah the guy who wants to get in your pants, that one? - He's not! - Anyway, listen. This guy, he just recently acquired a lot of stuff at an auction. And one of those things is this old book, it's a handwritten manuscript and they believe it may have been written by Hemingway. - No! - Yes! - It's amazing! - Aha. And? What do you mean, "and"? This is a big deal, don't you see it? Hemingway wrote a lot of things that went missing over the years. Especially when he was living in Cuba. So these guys believe that this is one of those pieces. So how do you know this is an original manuscript though? That's exactly what I'm trying to learn right now. I'm working on that. But if I can... if I can prove it is then I have a foundation for my work. "Unlocking the mystery behind Hemingway" or "Unlocking the mystery behind Hemingway's work". [Karen] Oh. - It has a good ring to it. - No? Well it's a working title. - It's a working title you know. - It's super catchy. Yeah I mean just... read it. I would go and spend some time in Cuba but there's no way to be certain. [Karen] What I've been telling you. Why don't we go? Why don't we go to Cuba? This weekend. Why don't we go? Okay, you've had one too many. - Go together? - Yeah. Just up and go? Yeah. Hey. I don't work this weekend. You don't work this weekend. Look. I'm gonna get us a round of shots. But if you decide to go to Cuba I might be in. It's not gonna be a hindrance to your research, right? No, no, I... Help me out, man! - See me looking at you? - Yeah, but... It is a perfect opportunity to give her the ring. Right. Yeah. - And then are you with me? - Yeah. Of course. It's great. Okay. Well. Let's go to Cuba. Yeah, let's go to Cuba. So, what's the verdict? Carlos, what's the verdict? To Cuba! Cuba! [Cuban music] Let's go. So this is it. Awesome. Carlos, is this uh... is this where you grew up? Is this the neighborhood? No. No. Not too far away from here though. Can I go unpack? [hissing] Hey do you have, uh... Do you have the Wi-Fi code? I told you. There is no connectivity here. Don't worry. At certain point I'm gonna have to go and find some place as well. I don't feel like I properly prepared for this trip. So, uh, what's the plan? Well, I was planning to go and visit one of the places where Hemingway stayed at. You guys wanna come? Nah I'm gonna pass. I've been thinking more rum, cigars, you know. Okay. I wanna come. It sounds like a great... great plan. - Sure. - Hey, you can smoke your cigars tonight. Leaving in five. [Cuban music] [general chatter] We should go in there later. - [Karen] What? - This is my house. Twenty dollars. Hey where did you go? You disappeared on us. I was just looking around trying to find something. Did you? I think so. Look! Cool. You know what that means? You about ready? What? Ready for what? To go out. Karen's almost ready. No, no. I can't go out right now. I need to find a place with the internet. The hell you can't! I went to the Hemingway thing for you! The least you could do is go out with us! I really need to get a jump on this as soon as possible. No, what you need to do is relax. You need a drink. Can't you find a stopping spot or something, man? We are going to your favorite restaurant. Good. Good. It's a really cool place. You'll like it. Um... So... Is tonight gonna be the night? No. I don't... This doesn't feel right and the date's off. You know, it's cloudy out. Hey, guys. You ready? You coming with us, Carlos? No, no. You know. As you can see I have a couple of things for the time right now, so. You know, even Hemingway used to take breaks and drink sometimes. You should listen to her. She's smart. [Karen] Come on. Let's go. Hey, hey! Speak English? [John] You haven't said a word about my new Cuban look, man. - Oh that's a Cuban look right there? - Yeah. Hah. - I got it off the street. - You are actually worried about that look? - No. - Yes. - It is legit Cuban gear. - Ha, seriously? Sure, we got gypped, fine. And he's embarrassing me on the streets of Havana. I've seen these pants everywhere, everyone is wearing them. Everywhere in Havana. Yeah, of course. Carlos, I think you need to take us on a tour of your... city. I wish I could, but you guys have to understand I'm working here. That's the main reason why I came here, to work. As you can see he's here to work. Yeah, believe it or not I'm finding great things along the process. - Really? - Yeah. Tell us about it. Well... You know, I mean... I don't know, important things like... I don't want you guys to think I'm getting nuts. Oh, we know you are nuts. You can just go on. It's a little late for that. I found this section of the book I have. It is description about a place, a house. Abandoned house. Apparently that place was shut down by the '58th when the police found five bodies in the basement. Now, Hemingway was here and I believe he was looking very closely into this because he was doing some research for a book or something. The manuscript I have is a sort of diary that he was using to keep track in this case. If I can prove this... This... This is perf. I can get this published. You got my attention. Sounds good! So what happened to the dead bodies? They were mutilated. Nice. Right. For the story of course. Yeah. So there's only one last thing to do. You may go to the house and check it out. As a matter of fact it is very close to our place. Perfect. - Close? How close? - Mm-hm. Blocks away. We have no excuse. That's why we didn't stay at the hotel. So this guy could go to the house. Sneaky, sneaky Carlos. - What are you doing, weirdo? - Shh! - Hold on, let me turn the light on. - No, no, don't, don't! [whispering] Just come over here. Come. What are you staring at? You see that guy? He's gone. You guys, what are you doing? Honey, go back to bed. I'll be right there. Great. Get some sleep. He's gone. Alright? ♪♪♪ Will you... Will you marry me? - Is that a yes? - It's yes. Carlos! We have cause for celebration! [Karen] Just got engaged! - Nothing? Really? - Carlos? Did you hear me? - [John] I don't feel that you're grasping... - Look! ...the full magnitude of this moment. You have to see something. What do you got? Just look. Oh, it's all starting to make sense now. Who is she? Alright, where did you get it? Someone just slided it under the door. - Probably a mistake. It's a neighbor or something. - No, Karen. Karen. It's not a mistake. See that handwriter? You see it? It's the same. Okay. Nice. Progress, right? Now we got two reasons to celebrate. Now, can we go? No, we're not celebrating anything. There's no reason to ce... Don't you see what's happening here? Really? You cannot see it? They know what I'm doing, this is a statement. They're trying to tell me something. Like that guy from yesterday, he was standing right there. You saw him. For an hour looking at me, is that normal to you? Hey, what guy? It was some weirdo watching Carlos. I don't know. Look, it's Cuba, man. It's... It's to be expected. Like somebody is watching me all the time. I'm being surveyed all the time. Somebody's after me, I can feel it. - Okay, you are starting to sound a little paranoid, Carlos. - No, it's not paranoid. Look! Calm down, man! Fuck! I'm sorry. Whatever. Crazy. Dude, what the fuck? I'm sorry. You know what? You know I love you but... Get your shit together, man. Maybe we can row on these little boats, super cheap. Oh, probably not. Take a look at that. [exhales] What do you... What do you want...? The number in the building. It matches for the one at pictures. So what, man? What... You gotta be kidding me. I'm so done with this. The same house. Same number. Same building. Same street. Same everything. Don't you see it? That woman, whoever she is, she came here because of that. Can't you just let it go, brother? Just... What do you mean let it go, John? John, I wanna go home. Baby, please. Just come sit down. No, I said I wanna go home right now. I wanna celebrate and Carlos has been acting crazy since he got here so we can't. So let's get the fuck out of here. Listen, I'm sorry to bother you with all this, but seriously there's something behind this. I can feel it... I mean this is not normal. If you're so worried about her why don't you just go to the police? What am I gonna tell them? They're not gonna listen to me. Right now I don't wanna fucking listen to you. Well, just... Just help me in, that's all. Help you in where?! I need to get into that building. I need to see what's inside. Alright, John. If Carlos wants to go into that building we're gonna go into the building to see what's inside. Let's go. Now. How are we gonna get in? I already tried the door. It's locked. Told you I tried. Thought you said this was locked. It was locked. Hello? Hello? It's not bad, you know. It needs a little paint. Little touch-up. It's real. It's real marble. Very nice. Let us see what's up here. [John] Carlos? I'm here. [low grunting] What's that? I have no idea. [loud stumbling noise] Fuck! Come on! [Karen] Hello! Hello! Hello! Can anyone hear us? There has to be another exit. Did you boy Ernest say anything about these doors lock up, huh? Is that in the manuscript? What is this? Just great. "There is no hunting like the hunting of man. And those who have hunted..." It's a quote from Hemingway. Oh, really? What does it mean? - What paint... - Wait. Wait, don't touch that. "...for anything else." Of course. Alright. Worth a shot. How are we gonna get out of here? There has to be an exit somewhere. That would be great... I'm about done with this... [Karen gasps] [Carlos] What is this? What... Where are we going, Carlos? We're going down the hallway. Are you crazy? Looks to me like... we need to follow the lights. We don't know who's turning on these lights. I think we should go find him. Think he's out there. There's no exit out there. There is no exit. We need to just go through the hallway and find an exit. Carlos, I'm not going anywhere with you. I'm sick and tired of your bullshit. You got us into this... - Listen, I didn't ask you to... - Guys, that's enough. Focus. Wait. It halts. - What's wrong? - It stopped working... [Karen breaths heavily] That one. I don't know. [Karen shrieks lightly] I'm gonna go inside, just take a look. Okay. I'll just go and see first. - [John] Clear? - [Karen] It's clear. It's clear. What is this place? Baby, I don't know. [Karen gasps] [John] Come on! Carlos! Carlos! Carlos! [knocking repeatedly on the door] Help! - [Karen] Help! - [John] Carlos! Hey, John. - [Karen] Help! - John... Hey! Karen! - [loud noise] - [John] Carlos! [Karen] Babe! Babe! What's... What's going on, guys? - Fuck! Fuck! - [Karen screams] [Karen gasps] [distorted voice] Welcome! You stepped through that door at your own free will. So now the game must begin. Good luck. You have sixty seconds to your start before I set them loose on you. I suggest you use your time wisely. [Karen panting] Run! [panting] [beeping] John? Hey, John. Is that you? [panting] [panting heavily] What? - Where's Carlos? Where's Carlos? We should go find him. - Sh. Be quiet. [whining] - John, please. - Shhh. We should get out... - We can't rescue... Please. Hear to me. He's here... - Shhh. Look at me. Shhh. We're gonna make it out of here. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. Okay. Alright, here we go. - Go! - [Karen screams] - Oh, shit! - [Karen screams] Go! [John] Wait! [John struggles] Go! - [John groans] - [Karen screams] [grunting] Come in! - How are you doing? - [John grunts] - Please don't take it... - Babe, I got to take it... [Karen] We got to leave. Are you alright? [John] I can't move, just take the damn thing here... - [Karen] It's going to bleed a lot though! - [John] It hurts! - Oh, shit! - [screams] Carlos! Are you okay? Oh, shit, the door! Hold the door! Oh, lord, Carlos! - [John grunts] - [Karen] What? Okay... Okay. Right, okay. Look at the venting! [Karen] Through the venting! [Karen panting heavily] Stop! Why are you doing this to us? You need to play the game. We just... We just want to go. Nobody goes home. [Carlos moans] [distorted voice] Get up! And finish it! [man] They are not far from the next room. Now, get up. Go after them and do it. I got you. Come on. [moans] I can't. - I can't. - Keep moving. I can't... - I can't. I can't. - Shh. Come on. That's alright. I shouldn't have brought you here... I shouldn't have brought you here. Just keep moving. Okay? Come on. Come on. Come on. [alarm goes off] Come on! Go! Let's go, let's go! - Come on! - Come on! Carlos! No! God... No! [John cries] It is a glorious day. We gotta go. We've gotta go, okay? What is this place? They are in the meat room. [Karen screams] Don't fucking move! Who are you people? Who are you? - I'm no one. - What is this? The game. What game? - The game you chose to play. - No! Oh, yes. You found the book. You followed it here. Like everyone else before you. How do we get out of here? How do we get out of here? You don't. [distorted voice] It's impossible. John. Let's go... Let's go. [indistinct TV chatter] - You broke the rules. - No. I can fix it. I can play the game. [gasps] John... John! John... John... John, John! Look at me! Oh, no! John! [screams] [soft eerie music] [Karen cries lightly] [man] Comfortable, yes? [muffled scream] This is going to be long and painful. [cries and screams] Clever girl! No, Sir! We didn't expect that to happen, Sir. Yes, Sir. I can guarantee that she will not leave this place alive, Sir. And if she does, she won't get far. All games have ended, Sir. No, Sir. No survivors. The other set of books? Shipping out tonight, Sir. They should reach their destination within the next 48 hours, Sir. Don't worry, Sir. [scoffs] We'll take care of her, Sir. We always do, Sir. [crying] Your fucking game is over! [policewoman] Madam, there's nothing here. No blood... No room with monitors... There's nothing. You have to believe me. You have to! My friends, they... were here. These people, they... They did this to me! They killed them. They killed my boyfriend, please. They tried to kill me. Please, you have to believe me! Calm down, okay? We couldn't find anything you said in your statement. I'll show you. Let me show you, okay? I'll show you. I'll show you... Calm down, madam. Calm down! Let me show you? Okay? I'm not making this up. Please! You have to believe me! It was here. It was all here. He was... He was here! [stuttering] No, but John was here, he was! He was... he was here. Madam. Madam, quiet. Okay? No, no, you have to believe me, please! Please! - Madam? Madam! - John was here! No! He was... You have to believe me! [slow piano music] [white noise] [exhales] [pants] - Miss Johnson. - [gasps] Please, don't scream. Please... Please... Relax, Miss Johnson. If I wanted to hurt you, I would have done so already. On the contrary, I'm here to congratulate you. You should be proud of yourself. You're the first to make it out of our event in one piece. The rules of our little game are simple and must be abided at all times. No one lives to talk about the game. No one. You broke that rule. You won but at no avail, I'm afraid. Who are you? Who I am doesn't matter. What matters is this: no matter how far you run, no matter where you try to hide, we will be there, Miss Johnson. Nothing ends unless we say so. Do you understand? Now, these are the new rules. You will leave this place in two hours. Two hours and we'll... we'll start hunting you down. Ah, you just lost four seconds, Miss Johnson. I'll see you on the other side, Miss Johnson. [whistling] [thrilling music] Subtitles by explosiveskull
