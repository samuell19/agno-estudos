The islands have always been a mystery. Since the beginning, over 1500 years ago when the first Polynesians arrived. Following the light of the eastern star called Nanamua. With only the stars to guide them they sailed 2,000 miles in canoes to migrate to the islands and they believed that they had finally found paradise. But paradise is an elusive thing. As long as men exist. But this time new foreigners came. Perhaps seeking this elusive peace or bringing us a new peace. In 1820 the Thornton's and Hiram Bingham came to the islands to bring us the good news. Well, Reverend. I hope it's what you expected. It's more. What are you looking to do here with these savages? They're people, Skipper Jack. They're naked! It's all right, dear. Tell that to Captain Cook. They were not warmly received when they arrived in the village. Our people have long memories and they remembered the ghost of Captain Cook. They also despised the whalers who preyed upon our women. All was not well. What do you want with Olani? I have a letter of intent from Papua Akia in Boston he arranged a meeting for both myself and Chiefess. We should go this is not safe. They don't want us. Leave them be, Kanoa Ah. I am Chiefess Kapiolani. Ah, it's a pleasure to finally meet you, Chiefess. We didn't expect you to be so young. It is rank that matters here in the islands, Reverend Thornton, not age. It is a pleasure to meet all of you, come. Makana, Kapu help them with their luggage. You have a beautiful country. And you speak English so well. The British sailors taught us. Starting with Captain Cook's men 50 years ago. Ah, uh-huh, well. Henry, don't provoke them. The Chiefess has everything under control, right? They're gesturing towards us and pointing. Come, come, stay with us. We didn't know what to make of these new visitors. They were not like the others. The whalers who only wanted to drink rum and possess our women. These people were here for something else and it made all of us uneasy. The woman you encountered earlier in the village who was alarming anyone, that is Priestess Kanoa. Yeah, I saw. Not everyone is like her. The gods are extremely angry with us. I don't believe in God. Only believe in myself. Yeah, we can see that, Skipper. The gods? Yes, Pele, she is god of the volcano. It is she who shaped the sacred land. We fear her greatly. Henry, where are we going? I'm so tired, I need to rest. Why are you here? We are just here to help. Are you here to convert us? No, only God can do that. Why are you here then? To help, we want to help you in anyway we can. Why do foreigners always think they can help? You brought guns to our islands, remember? Hey, those guns are here to protect you, too. From what? Other guns. Is there something wrong? The goddess is very angry. War is prevalent. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but your goddess is an angry goddess? Pele is temperamental. She devours the land. She is a goddess of citron, Halema'uma'u along with her husband Lohiahu. It was when Lohiahu kissed another woman, her own sister, that she covered him in lava. And how do you appease her? By sacrificing. Sacrificing what? Humans. We didn't always practice human sacrificing. There has been a priest from Tahiti, who brought the practice in. His name was Paow almost 900 years ago. But it was abolished by King Kamehameha the second only a few years ago. But some are trying to bring it back. Who on earth would try and bring back such a barbaric practice? Your Pele sounds like a very jealous god. Does it not say in your holy book that I am a jealous god? That only means, that only means that we shall have no other gods before him. How dare you judge us when your culture has the same practice. I am not judging you. If I were to judge you, you would know it. I would just suggest, we are not trying to fool you. So what truly is your purpose here then? We spoke with one of your people in Boston. He came to us and shared that there was struggle and suffering among your people and our faith moved us to go forward and travel 10 months in hard conditions on a broken down ship. We came here to assist you. To build, to help you with planting and caring for the sick. And for sharing good news. Good news? So, the truth comes out. Over there is your hut. Kapu, Makana, take them. Okay, I'm going to head back to the ship and I hope they don't have too much ketchup here. Why? Well, to put on you after they cook you. Good luck, farewell. Walk. I knew that was why they had come. Our ancestor Henry Okaheo went to their land several years ago and died. But his spirit brought back this good news. It was about their god, but we already had gods, many of them. Why would we need one more? What would compel them to travel all this way to tell us about their one god? Our enemies have arrived. This is not good. Where are they from? How can you be certain they are our enemies? Because they come from the land that cursed dog Opukahaia went to. A place called America. So the ship is leaving? Yes, it's going back to England. And you and your friends have stayed behind? Yes. What do they want? What do you think they want? They want to force us to worship their God. The god of Captain Cook? Yes Captain Cook’s god. The foreign man brought guns and canons to our lands and nothing more. But these people don’t have guns. To me, it seems they are here to help. Don’t be a fool Mele! We must get them off our island. Let’s ask Pele first. We don't want to die. We will not die. They will die first. Be careful. Maybe these foreign people are some foreign gods? Never. That’s legend. I sense fear in them. Their god has no power. Their god will not protect them from ME. What do you mean by that? Pele is angry, but her anger will subside. I'm not talking about Pele. All due respect, Chiefess, I'm talking about the god who created heaven and earth. The god through which all things were made. Nothing exists without him. May I introduce you to Akira Endo. Nice to meet you. He is a samurai warrior from Japan. My pleasure, how did you end up here Mr. Endo? I was the Japanese ambassador to Holland under the Tokugawa, but pirates over took our ship and I was taken hostage. Incredible tale, sir. Where are you from? America. Would you look at that, bloody missionaries. If they keep this up, they're gonna convert the entire bloody island. Aye, that's right they will. Well I'm not gonna let that happen. Without whiskey, without rum, without women, what left is there? Nothing! Nothing, it's an outrage! Let's go, boys. We are all cursed. The gods are angry we have let these foreign people into our land. They are infidels! They must die by tomorrow night. The gods are angry Kanoa has spoken with Pele so we know she is right. They must die by tomorrow night. No... Anyone who lays a hand on them will be put to death. Then command them to LEAVE, Chiefess They’re helping us. I will not force them to leave. They are our guests. Chiefess, if the goddess demands it, we must obey. Let us sacrifice them! We cannot sacrifice the foreign man. They are defiled like women. You know human sacrifice was abolished. You will not touch anyone Mere humans cannot abolish what the great goddess requires. Our king did. And he's human. Besides, he only issued a Kanalaa. It can be broken, Chiefess. Kamehameha is Ali’i nui because he is a descendant of the celestials! ENOUGH. I have heard from Pele. She wants to destroy us all This man does not believe in Pele. Do you, Mr. Thornton? Answer me. I believe in god, that's all. Henry, what is going on, come. What is going on? It's all under control. - Control? - Yes. I heard them, they want to kill us. That's Kanoa, she has some kind of a. This is insanity, we must leave. God will protect us, Mary. How can you be so sure, Brother Hiram? Psalm 91. Words will not stop a spear from piercing your heart. God is in control brother Henry. Yes, God is in control. This is insane, we must leave here. I'm sorry for what has happened. I will do everything in my power to protect you, but. But what? You must be careful. The priestess Kanoa, she's very powerful and she has great influence on the people. Shoo, shoo! The foreign woman. Shoo! I don't know why she came here. She is so miserable. Oh, I can't stand it. - I - feel sorry for her. I don't know how much longer they intend to stay. Oh Henry, the mosquitoes are everywhere here. Yeah, just blame it on Captain Cook. KAPU! COME HERE. Hurry! Kapu. Approach. I'm sorry but we must make a sacrifice to Pele. Kipa! Nalau! Take him to the altar! Alika! Please don't do this. Enough. Take Kapu to the altar - he will be sacrificed today. WAIT! Blame it on Captain Cook. What, what does that mean? He brought mosquitoes to the islands. Or should I say mosquito larvae. They were in the water they brought aboard the ships. Did he bring anything good? Yeah, towels, coats. Good morning, Reverend Henry. Good morning, Makana. Miss Mary. What's going on here? Our sacrifice has escaped. What sacrifice? Kapu. Why did they choose him? They claimed he stole from them, but it's not true. If Kanoa and Alika get their way he will be drowned or sacrificed. I thought they abandoned the sacrifice of humans? We did, but Alika and Kanoa wish to return to the ways of the past. This is madness. Mary! Mary, Mary where are you going? Stop, stop! How could you bring me here? I mean, you wanted to come. No, you told me that these were a peaceful loving people. Well, I hate them. I hate every last one of these filthy, worthless savages! Mary, please. Your words are accountable to God. These filthy, worthless savages they are God's creation just like us. They have a soul just like us. Why should I care what God thinks? God cares nothing for me. If he cared one wit about my welfare I would be in Boston instead of on this wretched island. You brought me to this god forsaken land, half a world away from everything and everyone I have ever loved and you expect me to be gracious as they prepare to sacrifice a man! How are you going to share your faith when you despise them? If you think that they want your faith then you are a fool, Henry. They want nothing from you and yet you continue to try ingratiate yourself with them. What is it that you want? Maybe you'd like one of these Hawaiian women for yourself? Oh, my god. I'm so sorry, Mary. Please. God, what have I done? I hate you. I curse the day that we met. You will never lay a hand on me again. Mary. Be careful, Chiefess. What do you mean? We don't know what their intentions are. They have come to Japan to force us to trade. We refused. And? They threatened to take over our country. Be careful. Well, how are you on this fine evening, good sir? May I help you gentlemen? Gentlemen! No gents here, just us boozing, whoring, good for nothing sinners, right preacher? I'm not here to judge you. Oh you're not? What if I did this, huh? Huh! Am I a sinner now, huh? Am I a sinner now? Stop it. Stay out of this, old man. This doesn't concern you. I said, that's enough. What, who are you? Go in peace. Boys, let's go. Let's get out of here, come on. You are not well received, Mr. Bingham. I guess not. So, why are you here? To tell people about God. I can't believe you travel this long a journey for that. There must be another reason. Like what? Like you want to force these people to trade with you. I assure you, I have no such intentions. Americans came to Japan to force us to trade with you, remember? That's not why I'm here. I'm here for something more valuable. And what is that? I'm hoping to find out. Excuse me. Let's go. I can't take this.... I did nothing wrong What a coward You're such a great warrior Kapu You should be honored to sacrifice yourself Stop crying! You filthy coward! I don't deserve to die! Oh that poor man. Chiefess, can't you do something? I don't agree with this, Mrs. Thornton. But I cannot go against what the priestesses say in regards to Pele. There must be a sacrifice. But aren't you their leader? What would happen if they were not to go through with this? The volcano might erupt and completely cover this island. You truly believe that? Pele was exiled by her father because of her anger. The last straw was between her and her sister. Namakaokahai who's husband Pele had seduced. Pagan barbarism! Hiram! Hiram, what happened? Nothing, I'm okay. Did someone attack you? Yes. Who? Who did this to you? The sailors. Why does God allow all of these worthless beasts to roam the earth? Mary, we must love our enemies. And even pray for those that persecute us. Otherwise, what difference is there between us and them? Sometimes it is not possible or practical to live out God's word. Mary, keep the faith, Mary. I have known Kapu for many years. He was a good man. He does not deserve to die like this. I watched them put him on the altar. I became filled with rage. What god requires a man to die for it's appeasement and if it isn't appeased will erupt and destroy more innocent lives? These foreigners speak of a just god. Who is right? It is a great honor to die for your god, Kapu. Pele will be appeased. Your spirit will be released so you can be free! With the sword of Captain Cook Goddess, we offer this sacrifice to you. It is a great day! Pele has been appeased. What is the matter with all of you? We are saved! I know that is wrong. It is. I knew Kapu, he is not a bad man. I'm sure he wasn't. Take him to the volcano as a sacrifice to Pele And throw him in. Mary, are you all right? Mary, please, talk to me. I can't believe this is happening. They sacrificed a human life just to appease some pagan god. Henry, please take me back home. I don't want to stay here. We don't belong here, for the love of God, Henry please. I should have said something. No, no, we can't. This is their land, not ours. We can't forget that. We can't forget that. And so two months went by and we watched these missionaries from a distance. Unsure of what to make of them. They continued to persevere. Meanwhile, the foreign woman becomes more frail by the day. I fear she may not live much longer she is so weak and fearful. Mary, I may never have said this to you before. I love you. I'm so sorry for what you had to go through while you're here. I promise to have you on the first boat home. You have my word on this. I promise, Mary. Woo! That was incredible. You did pretty good for your first time. Thank you. Do you have any children, Mr. Bingham? I did. But my son passed. And shortly afterwards my wife died. We're sorry, Mr. Bingham. How you overcome such a loss? God, he helped me through it. Is the woman doing OK? She's not adjusting well, unfortunately. Is there anything we can do to help her? I don't know what to do, honestly. Except pray. You pray, to god? Yes. Are you all right, dear? We're going to die here, Henry. No, God will protect us. If there is a god, he's not here. We need to go home. I will take care of you. Get me off this savage island. I made a promise to you and I'll have you on the next boat home. And I'll be with you, I promise. I'll never leave your side, I promise. God help me! Help me know what you want me to do. Oh, I've utterly failed in everyway. My wife despises me, Lord. She'll never forgive me. God, did you just send all of us here to die? It seems neither of us can sleep tonight. Uh, no, it's true, it's true. How is your wife? She's not well. I'm afraid she's not well. I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything I can do? No, no she's being ferociously attacked by a terrible, terrible enemy. Enemy? Yes. What enemy? Satan, the devil. Ah, yes, the enemy of all. Tell me something. Why does our god require a sacrifice and yours does not? There was a human sacrifice and his name was Jesus Christ. Wait a minute, you said this Jesus was God's son. How did he become a human sacrifice? For what reason? He let himself be killed as a final sacrifice to appease the wrath of God for all of our sins. Now I'm really confused. You and Hiram spoke of this god of love now he is a god of wrath? Which one is it? It's hard to believe in a god that could have so many facets to his personality that he could love his children, bring the grace of forgiveness to the whole world, and still have such anger against those who sin against him. But why would God want to sacrifice his only son? Why not an evil person who deserves it? Because it was a perfect sacrifice. The only acceptable sacrifice to God. A god who sacrifices himself for humans. That intrigues me. Have a good night, Mr. Thornton. Good night, your highness. Good night, Chiefess. Father God, please help us. We came to bring the good news about your son to these people but it's been anything but good for us. Please dear God, bless my wife. Help her recover, if it is your will. Please dear God. If it is your will. The next ship arrives in less than two weeks. The missionaries have now been on our island for three months. The woman missionary is doing poorly. We offered her meat, poi, but she cannot eat what we eat. Perhaps their holiday celebration will lift her spirits. For you. Would love to, thank you, thank you. Very good, mahalo. You're welcome. Mahalo, mahalo. Chiefess, I understand they will all leave on the next ship. Mr. Thornton and his wife will leave, but Mr. Bingham will stay. They must all be gone. I’m the Chiefess of this tribe. It’s by my orders who may stay and who must leave. They are a danger to our tribe. Like Cook they will attempt to make everyone forget our gods. They’re infidels. How? They must all be aboard the next ship. Kanoa has the entire islands in the grip of fear. No one wishes to listen. Even to possible truth. Look at all of them. Look at all the stars. How many are there? A billion? A trillion? We come here, some of us away from our families and our homes. But to spend Christmas with others and any sacrifice for the sake of Jesus Christ is rewarded much more. Reverend Henry, Makana to you. Merry Christmas. Oh, thank you, Makana. And merry Christmas for you. May I join you guys? Yes please, it's so nice to see you came. Akira, yes? Can we sing "Silent Night" for you? Yes, please. Bless us with your beautiful voices, young men. Ready? ♪ Silent night, holy night ♪ ♪ All is calm, all is bright ♪ ♪ 'Round yon virgin mother and child ♪ ♪ Holy infant so tender and mild ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavily peace ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavily peace ♪ Well that was beautiful. Let's sing it again. ♪ Silent night, holy night ♪ The leaders were looking for you. I was at gathering with the missionaries. I don’t understand... It was unlike anything.... I’ve ever heard... What happened? I felt.... Peace Love Joy. What are you saying? You’re not... What if... it really is true? This God took the form of a human being and sacrificed Himself for the redemption of the entire world... That is unfathomable. Our villager Opukaha’ia believed. He wrote about this Jesus. But I didn’t understand. Chiefess, there will be another sacrifice in three days. Who? Makana Makana Are you kidding? No. We must end this. We cannot Chiefess. The god Ku demands it. Do you have no regard for our King Kamehameha II? He commanded the end of human sacrificing. He ended sacrifice because of the foreign man Captain Cook and the British sailors who wanted our goods. You want us to stop worshipping our god? What if our god is not what we think he is? What if there is another path? You are allowing the foreign man’s beliefs to infiltrate your mind. What kind of god requires a human sacrifice? Makana is a good man and we’re going to kill him because Kanoa commands it? She is only a woman. Only a woman? Kanoa is very powerful. Do not cross her. The decision is made. He will be sacrificed. God...please... if you are out there.... I want to know the truth. Who are you? Who are you really? Please show me the truth... I NEED to know!! I cannot go on like this! If you exist, show me! Show me! Mary, Mary this is the freshest food you will ever find. Much fresher than in Boston. And look here, they were just. They gave you a gift. I'm so sorry what you're going through here. Merry Christmas, Mary. Merry Christmas. Is she okay, Hiram? She's suffering from some sort of break down. I don't know what to do, honestly. Henry is with her now. Well, what about prayer? Yes. Prayer. Deep prayer. He who dwells in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty. I will say of the Lord, he is my refuge and my fortress, my God. In him I will trust. Surely he shall deliver you from the snare of the foul and from the perilous pestilence. He shall cover you with his feathers and under his wings you shall take refuge. His truth shall be your shield and buckler. You shall not be afraid of the terror by night nor of the arrow that flies by day. Nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness. Nor of the destruction that lays waste at noon day. A 1,000 may fall at your side and 10,000 at your right hand but it shall not come near you. Only with your eyes shall you look and see the reward of the wicked because you have made the Lord who is my refuge, even the most high, your dwelling place. No evil shall befall you. No evil shall befall you. No evil shall befall you. Did you want to see me? I have heard some distressing news. What? Has Chiefess Kapiolani accepted this new God? I don’t know the answer to that question. Don’t lie to me! Pele punishes ALL liars! She loves and respects Pele, you know that. We will get it out of her. Pray to Pele it’s not true. Gather the elders and other priestesses. Henry. Heave, heave, heave! Heave, give it all you've got, heave! Heave! Give it all you've got, heave, heave! Come on, come on. I'm so happy you survived. Mary, Mary are you okay? Yes. Huh? I'm just glad he survived. Oh me too, me too. I'm so sorry. I've behaved so terribly. I made a fool of myself and I brought shame on our entire group. No, you didn't, Mary. I can see it in their eyes. You were so brave to come here in the first place. I should have seen, before we came, how difficult it would be here for you. Oh Mary, I'm so proud. I'm so proud of you. Thank you, thank you. And just like that Mary became a new person. The heavy veil of oppression lifted from her. It was the beginning of a new day. So beautiful. Yes, it is so beautiful. I was talking about you. Me, Henry. You find me beautiful? Yes. Stay strong my brothers. Our god demands a sacrifice... we’ve picked a man This man fulfills the requirements of Pele. We have picked Makana. What's going on? They are sacrificing another of us. Again? Who? Makana. Why? Because his father was an enemy of our king. God give us strength. I’m sorry brother. You have been chosen. Your father served King Kalikele and therefore was an enemy You would have me pay for the sins of my father? I’m sorry. You will be sacrificed tomorrow morning to Ku and Pele. This is madness. Utter madness! Hiram, what's wrong? They're sacrificing again. A human? Yes, Makana. Not Makana, this can't be. We have to stop this. I don't know how we can. I pity you Makana. You should have gone like a man. Henry always says that we shouldn't interfere. Look what good that did last time. I'm not gonna stand by and watch an innocent man be put to death. It's only one of you, Hiram, with no weapons against all of these warriors. I'm sorry, Mary. I have to try. Makana is my friend, my brother! He's our friend, too but I'm afraid there's nothing you can do. I'm sorry, Mary. I have to try. The gods are not happy. Let him go. We captured him. He will be sacrificed. You do not lead this tribe, Alika. I answer to Pele and Ku. They require a human sacrifice. Kanoa said- -Kanoa does not lead our tribe. I will not tolerate our gods being defiled. Our entire village could die if we do not appease them. Look up the volcano is already angry. I am trying to save our village from destruction. If you care about your people, you will hold your tongue against me Are you gonna let them sacrifice Makana? What choice do I have, Mr. Bingham? I cannot go against what Pele asks. Tell them to stop. But it is up to the gods. Alika says ‘no one’ may enter. Under strict orders I am your Chiefess I command you let him in. Be quick, Hiram. Yes, Chiefess. How are you Makana, my brother? I'm so sorry for the trouble we got you in, my friend. I am to die tomorrow. I need to know the truth about your god. He's not my god. He's everyone's god. He can be your god too. It's too late now. It's never too late. As long as there is breath in your body the Bible says he who calls upon the Lord will be saved. Is it possible? Yes. It is a wonderful thing for a god to sacrifice himself for us. Brother Hiram, please, my wife and children. Make sure they are taken care of, please. Yes, of course I will. What I wouldn't give to go surfing again. It is time, Makana! What is this? Where is Makana? I am taking his place. I said, I am taking his place. You can sacrifice me instead. Why is Hiram with them? He must have done something wrong. Hiram, what are you doing? What is going on? What's going on? Stay back! Alika! Don't do this GET OUT! Why are you holding Mr. Bingham? He said he would be sacrificed. What? What, no! I don't have a family, Makana does. Hiram, this is not our affair! Hiram this is madness, please tell them no. ♪ Holy night ♪ ♪ All is calm, all is bright ♪ ♪ 'Round yon virgin, mother and child ♪ ♪ Holy infant so tender and mild ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace ♪ ♪ Silent night, holy night ♪ ♪ Shepherds quake at the sight ♪ ♪ Glories stream from heaven afar ♪ Hiram, don't!

Give me your ears! I have been your Chiefess for two years. You know I have served you faithfully and with integrity. Everything I have done has always been for the good of the community. We should never be afraid of the truth. No matter how it hurts. I’ve made a decision. You no longer have to worship Pele. You have the freedom to worship whomever you choose. What are you saying? You heard me. They may choose to worship whomever they want. PELE WILL KILL US ALL FOR YOUR INSOLENT WORDS! She will rain fire and brimstone on us How dare you speak against her I believe God is bigger You don’t believe in Pele anymore? No. Is she not also a foreign deity from Borabora? Chiefess, have you lost your mind? You are still free to worship your god. Prove your God is real. How? Go to the volcano and see if Pele will allow you to live. I shall do that tomorrow, when the sun rises. In the meantime, release Mr. Bingham to me. Oh thank god, thank god. Come, come. You're safe now, you're safe now. Hiram, please, please, Hiram. Once Kapiolani dies tomorrow morning kill the foreigners Which ones? All of them. Let's make sure no one comes to our island again Is this necessary? Just send them back to their country. You DARE to challenge me Alika? No You are the only one that wants them dead. So what? When Kapiolani dies, I will then become your Chiefess. Pele will be merciful to us after Kapiolani is gone You aren’t really doing this to appease Pele are you? What do you mean? This is about power. You want to be the Chiefess. Don't you ever speak that way to me again You must leave now before the villagers arise. I have a boat waiting to take you to Oahu. Why? If I do not return you will be killed. You will return. Either way you should leave. If we leave now then our faith means nothing. The priestesses, they're very powerful. They may have us killed before this all plays out. No one has ever returned from the volcano. Sweetie, that was so beautiful, you were wonderful. Yeah. It's a good boy. - Come here. - Good boy. Listen, she's arranged for us to leave tomorrow morning on a boat. Why? Because they're gonna kill us if she does not come back. I believe she will return. No, I know, but we can't be certain. I'm not concerned about myself but I cannot let anything happen to you. I am not afraid to die as long as I am with you. Good, thank god. I know, I know. It will be all right, we're in God's hands. Just come with me, come on. Okay, come on. Jesus, I love you. I know you are the son of God. I know you are the savior of the world. Please be with me as I go to the volcano. And if I die, I look forward to seeing you. Farewell. I am going but I will be back. Don’t be a fool, Chiefess I'm asking you not to do this We have had our differences but I don’t want you to sacrifice yourself. We beg of you not to do such a foolish thing. Chiefess, you have been good to all of us! If you do this, you will never come back. What was lost shall be found. All of the prophecies say you will die if you go to the Halema’uma’u without a sacrifice. Then I shall die. Shame on you. You are an infidel like them. No one touches them while I am gone. That is a direct order. They will be unharmed. But if you do not return by the end of the day, they will die. Leave them be. Alika, it is me that you want. Kapiolani, I am willing to die today. We will kill you both! Will she be safe? Yes. Should I accompany her? No. I have heard that no one ever comes back alive. She's in God's hands now. You will stay, why? You knew the consequences if I fail. We won't desert you. Your faith is our faith. You're our sister in Christ. We will stand with you until death. You are truly my brothers and sisters then. - Yes. - Yes. Yes, we are one family now. Chiefess, please. Please forgive me. I behaved so despicably when I first arrived here. I treated you with such contempt. I was a poor example of a Christian and a woman. And yet you embraced our faith. I know now that I am no better than anyone here on this island and in fact far worse than you with your extraordinary courage. I know you do not have any reason to forgive me but please understand that my bigotry was only mine. It had nothing to do with them. Please forgive them, please forgive all of us. Mary, we have all been lost once. But now we are found. We are all children of our God. Be at peace, my sister. I love you. I love you, too, courage. The Lord is my shepherd I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake. Ye, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my name. Thou anointest my head with oil, my cup runeth over. Surely, goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord. God is with us. God be with her. Prove yourself, show yourself! Prove yourself to me. Are you asleep? Take cover! Kill them, kill them! Kill them all! All of them? Yes! He who dwells in the secret place of the most high. I will sayeth the Lord, he is my refuge and my strength. In him I trust. It is unfortunate it had to come to this. You have sung great chords. But we must follow orders. Prepare to die! Is she going into the volcano? Impossible.... Are you sure? She wants all of us to die! WAIT! She's coming out! She's alive, she's alive. She's alive. Let them go. They are free to worship the volcano god if they choose and we are free to worship our god. The truth shall set you free. You can worship any god you choose. As for me and my household, we will serve the Lord Jesus Christ. There will be no more killing, no more sacrifices. No more religion. You are set free from this bondage. No! Enough! Did you hear? There will be no more killing. This is our Chiefess and you will obey her command, go! Mahalo. I am sorry I misjudged you. My allegiance is to Pele but perhaps I will consider your god too That was the most courageous act that I've ever seen. It was not my doing, I was led by God. It was a miracle. We were afraid you wouldn't come back. I had my doubts. It is a cause for celebration. Who are you? A man, just like you. It was a cause for celebration. I felt something on that mountain I cannot describe. A hand of someone who protected me. And so it was, I finally understood what the good news meant. We found a new freedom we hadn't known and a god who deeply loved us. People tell me what a courageous act it was to challenge the volcano but it was courage born from the love of God. The love I had been searching for all my life.
