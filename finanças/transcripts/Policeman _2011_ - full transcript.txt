This is the most beautiful country in the world. Yaron! Yaron! Daniel! Shlomi! Ariel! Amir! Did you take a bath today? No. But the doctor told you to. I didn't feel like it. Nili... She was born in a village That never felt the sweet heat Where reputation is better than gold It's so quiet, it puts you to sleep Show me your smile Smile at me while they sleep They don't like it She likes the radio pumping hard She likes the radio pumping hard... '"To prepare the uterus muscles for labor, '"begin with circular movements on the contracting muscles. '"First, press on the inner thighs with your fingertips.'" '"Tighten and relax the buttocks, '"moving gradually towards the inner thighs.'" What? Come again? Move in. You should see Ariel, he got so thin. We shortened the route by 20 Km for him. He couldn't breathe going up the mountain, but he didn't say a word. On the way back he said he loves his hair. He said he's got a ball in his head big as a nut. Monday he has an important examination and I'm going with him. But he's strong. If he has the tumor, that's it. If he has the tumor, it's over. Touch. I'll go get you some ginger. The doctor said it's good for the blood. My mother is coming over, she can get it. No, I'll get it. Nili, don't tell anyone that the doctor said you could give birth any day now. It's bad luck. You hear? Not even your mother. Alright, relax. I'm going down. 1, 2... 3, 4, 5... Who is it? - Me. I was just leaving. Mother... Any moment now I'm going to be a father. The doctor told Nili she could give birth any day now. She's on pregnancy watch. I could have a baby girl at any moment. Yaroni, you're so beautiful. I've got to go. Just drink something. Tap water, Mom. Hello, Eli. What a house! My house. - Hi, Yaron. Nili is resting at home because of the pregnancy. Hi. - Nili had to rest because of the pregnancy. Want a bite? Nili couldn't come, she had to rest because of the pregnancy. Congratulations! - Thank you. What's up? You lost weight! Great body! Looking good! Anybody want anything? Ariel. I didn't sleep all night. Next week I have an important examination. I hope it will be alright. I'll take you to the hospital. We'll all go. Sit in the shade, I'll get you something to eat. Any moment now... I could become a father. The doctor told Nili she could give birth any day now. She has to stay in bed. She can't exert herself, so I can't fuck her. But it's moving. Guys, let's get started. Nice to see you guys. Pretty, but she got fat. She just got a fat ass. A fat ass is a beautiful thing. Eli, we're together. North squad against the Jerusalem squad? Let's go. 1, 2, 3, go! Start over. 1, 2, 3, go! Who's catching? Alright, let's go over the charges. '"Defendant No.1: The State of Israel. '"Defendants 2-6 are policemen from the counter-terrorist unit. '"On the 10th of April 2007, '"defendants 2-6, under the command of officer Samuel Dabach... '" who, I understand... - Passed away. '"Took part in a standard counter-terrorism operation '"to eliminate the terrorist Aiman Sirtawi. '"During the operation, the following residents were killed: '"Jamel El Zubeiyedi, 36 years old '"and Khaled El Zubeiyedi, 12 years old. '"Also severely wounded: Mustafa El Zubeiyedi, 65 years old '"and Moudjdawyi El Zubeiyedi, age 5, '"who has since been severely handicapped. '"The operation did in fact lead to the elimination of the terrorist.'" After all, one of you killed him. We all did. Guys, given the collected testimonies and Ariel's medical condition, you're stating that Ariel was responsible for the shooting that hit the El Zubeiyedi family. That's what we decided after we discussed it. It all depends on his consent. We'll talk to him. I'll talk to him. Yaron will talk to him. Thanks for coming. Don't mention it. We spoke about the trial yesterday. It was agreed that you'd take full responsibility. Why? The lawyer said nobody is interested in the case. The old wounded man died and the handicapped kid had problems before. The witnesses who saw the dead people were far away. Because of your treatment, you can't be tried. By the time you get better, it will be over. Is that the lawyer's idea? No. It's mine and Danny's and Shlomi's and Amir's. You think it's okay? Yes. The lawyer asks you to go to his office to sign some forms. If things were the other way around, you think you'd also? I would. I believe they would too. Ariel? You understand, don't you? It sounds okay. Dr. Ganz. - How are you? I looked for you. Have some coffee. Who is it? - Me. The elevator doesn't work. I can't. What happened? Nothing. Happy birthday. Come on, Mom. It's your birthday. Yaron, stay a bit longer. Mom. Come on, we'll lift Mom up. I've got to go. Go help them. - Just a second. What happened? Here I am. - Let's go. Take this side. Avi... Each lift counts for 6 years, plus one for next year. Everyone counts. 1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3... We wish you a happy birthday... Happy birthday to you... I heard you come home last night. It was nice at Eli's yard. He has a house with a lawn. His wife inherited it. After our daughter is born, when we have a little more money, we'll also buy something like that. Grass is good for kids. It will take us some time. No, no, we'll buy. What's going on with the trial? Is it settled with Ariel like you all decided? I told you, he agreed. He should sign the papers at the lawyer's. Otherwise it will be too late. Why are you hurting me? You know it makes sense. They'll send you to jail. They won't. - So they'll throw you out of the unit. What then? For Ariel it doesn't matter either way. Three years have gone by and you haven't come back. My Samuel, you completed your military service here, returned to the United States, we met at the university and got married. Everything was open before you but you missed Israel, and that was your disease. So you enrolled in the most dangerous unit in the police and what got you through it was your love for your friends and their love for you. You left at night and I didn't know where you were going and when you'd get back. I followed you all the way here and now I'm all alone. We will end with the song you loved so much, '"Yoram'". Samuel's brother, Jonathan, will accompany on guitar. The friends from the unit are welcome to sing along with us. He remained twenty years old And time went by Time that never touched his face Time without him... He was lost in the desert And never returned Only now can one speak To him Yoram, do tell me What should we do with a friend like you? What do we do with your death? With the memory of your existence? And with the forgetfulness? The son of a bitch stole our flowers! What is this car? It's an Arab from the North. Look at his roof. He hauls merchandise. Look, he's going to scratch your car. If he scratches my car, he's dead. Let's go. I'm staying. I want to think. I'll meet you there. Goodbye, fighters. Goodbye, fighter. She was born in a village That never felt the sweet heat Show me your smile Smile at me while they sleep She likes the radio pumping hard... Are you from Tel Aviv? Yaron. Naama. I'm a fighter policeman. Touch it. Touch what? How old are you? I'm 15. Almost 15 and a half. Why? I'm feeling better. It's salt. It cleanses. It's salt. Were you sleeping? No. This tree is good. '"It's time for the poor to get rich and for the rich to start dying. '"The Jewish State has become a state of masters and slaves. '"Those who have a private plane to take them wherever they want '"and those who don't have money for a bus ride. '"An evil state yelling at us to stay tranquil. '"Tranquility is a lie, silence is mud.'" This sentence sounds like an ad. - You think so? Go on. '"At least the Palestinians know they're occupied... '" Why mention the Palestinians here? We have to make it simple. Israel is the Western state with the biggest gap between rich and poor. World champions. Let's hear her out. - Sorry. You're very pale. Get him some juice. Lie down on the couch. It happens to him sometimes. These words weigh down on my head. Should I continue? Sure. '"It's time for the poor to get rich and for the rich to start dying. '"The majority is numbed with hatred of the other. This is obvious. '"The minority, perceiving itself as free, '"is numbed with individual freedom and free sex. '"Today nothing is less subversive than sex. '"We, a group of comrades '"who refuse to detach what we think from the way we live. '"We - at the age where supreme happiness is not sleep or leisure. '"We have decided to act.'" The rest is on paper. I worked on it yesterday. Can we smoke here? My mom is allergic, but when they're abroad, it's okay. '"Herzl (Father of Zionism) wrote: '"The Jews, precisely because of their history... '" Forget about Herzl. We'll skip that. '"We, the daughters and sons of the ugly Israel, '"born in a cruel, racist, violent and ignorant state, '"announce to you, the rich of Israel: '"Being so rich in a country where there is such poverty, is a crime. '"Your corpses, like crosses, will mark these scenes of crime.'" 1:40 minutes. I paused it during the breaks. It's still too sublime. Revolution is not poetry, it's prose. You're addressing people who will have to use weapons. Revolutions always start too early, when no reasonable person would give it a chance. This is why we must be very strong with words. Anyway, Shira, it must be finished by tomorrow evening. Your parents' living room is a real palace. I hate their house. They're pigs. But it's convenient. So out of tune... Who? - The violinist. Then replace him. - What? Take his violin and replace him. Give it to me for one moment, please. Play. Beautiful. You enjoyed it? Now pay up. Are you home? - Yes. Are you alone? - Yes. I wanted to tell you that... I found in my father's drawers all sorts of leaflets... and sheets of paper from when he... One moment. Oded? One moment. I think my father wrote this himself. '"A revolutionary is a doomed man '"with no sentiments, no emotional ties, not even a name. '"His true nature is the opposite of romanticism, of sentimentality.'" Are you listening? Yes. '"A doomed man. '"Friendship, love, family relations, '"he brutally represses it all, for the sake of a cold and absolute desire.'" '"One pleasure, one compensation, one solace, '"one solemn satisfaction. '"The joy of destruction, the success of the revolution.'" Wow. I wonder if I was already born when he wrote this. Ours is just as good. Better. Not everyone has a poet. Oded, I have to go now. I also have to hang up. Bye, Shira. I bought some pastries. They smell good, Dad. It's from the new place. Really tasty. I'm starving. Bring some cheese, I'll slice a tomato. Olives and olive oil. I'll just take a quick shower first. Sit down, relax. Tranquility is a lie. Silence is mud. Oded, what's with you? You're a bit hysterical lately. I'm not hysterical, I'm happy. Eat while it's still hot. Why the sudden happiness? Did you meet with Shira today? A drink? Got a weapon? A gun. Israeli women... Israeli women... You go with girls? What? You into girls too? I don't know. I'll take you on my motorcycle. - Israeli women... On Mars... They wear a combat vest And a uniform Israeli woman - It's no fun here Israeli woman - It's no fun here. Thank you very much. And now, something special. Yes, I'm Vanunu (Israeli atom-bomb spy) I'm Vanunu Yes, I'm Vanunu Under the table, watching TV Yes, I'm Vanunu Staring at the waitress Whose neck veins remind me Of a kite string Yes, I'm Vanunu... I sing and play keyboards, but I'm a dancer, a poet, a thinker, 27 years old. I'm everywhere with everyone. Who are you, Ionely girl? I'm 22. In two days I might be changing the order of creation and vanish. - A poet? Listen. '"It's time for the poor to get rich and for the rich to start dying. '"Not outside of nature, rather within it, does money circulate. '"It breathes and exhales, goes up and down, never sleeps. '"It sucks on the bones it hasn't devoured, forever hungry.'" It's a beautiful poem, but it's not mine. So I switched the words: '"It's time for the poor to get rich and for the rich to start dying.'" I wish. Thank you. I have a gun in my bag. Want to see it? I'm also a rebel. No. You're a big talker. You're making fun of me. You monkey. Yes? Ma'am, there's a Michael here, he wants to come up. He was here earlier but you didn't answer. I'm Oded's father. Tell her it's important. She can see you. I'm not here. - Shira, listen, it's important. Sir, you can't disturb her. Shira, I know. I found it in Oded's bag and he told me... So now you're going to tell somebody? - No. I thought about this all night. He won't want to be my son anymore. Can I come up? You have no reason to come up here. '"It's time for the poor... and for the rich... '" I've been writing these things for 30 years, but people here are idiots. All the exploitation here and everyone's happy. Let me come up. Sir, please. I hear how Oded talks about you. He loves you. One moment. Oded is my son. You know he's weak and easy to influence. Shira, please ask him not to come. Send him away. He will listen to you. If not, anything that happens to Oded will be because of you. If I could, I would do it myself, without anyone else. But I can't. I'm sorry, Shira. Either he comes up or he leaves. It's too noisy. You're right. - I'm begging you! Oded's dad, I understand you but I can't help you. Now, please leave. I'm hanging up. I need to tell you something. Last night my father went through my bag and found the gun. I had to tell him. He wants to come with us, to take part in the mission. I told him it's impossible. He said he'll do anything we do, but if we don't let him come, he'll ruin everything. He's downstairs. He came with me. What are you doing? Make sure the door is closed. The shutters. Now I have to shoot you in the head. Nathanel, I'm sorry... If we're serious, I have to shoot you in the head. Come in. My father says that I'm joining you all and going on the mission tomorrow, I'm doing it all because of you. Because I love you. Do you think so too? That's something only you can know. Tomorrow we might die. Shira... Now, leave. But I want to stay with you. It's impossible. Why? We're out of time and I love you. If I loved you, tomorrow we would die as lovers. I love someone else. Who? The one we all love. Does he know? He doesn't know and he won't. His head is not available for love. Enough, Oded. You must leave. They're already on their way. How do I look? This is crazy. - What? What, Dad? Dad! Odedi, we're not going. Open the door now! Traitor! It's for you, Oded. Because I love you. I hate you! I hate you! Open this door right now! I'll shoot myself in the head. You know I mean it. I'm pointing the gun at my head. Dad... Where've you been? You're smoking. Let's begin. Me and my daughter. Can someone move the girls out of the frame? The couple and me. Congratulations. Take good care of her. The couple and the fathers. I'll take care of this... The couple, the fathers, the brothers and the sisters. Congratulations. - Thank you. The couple, the fathers, the brothers, the sisters and the mother. The couple, the fathers, the brothers, the sisters, the mother and the uncles. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congratulations. If anyone tries anything, I'll shoot him! Nobody move! No one move! If anyone moves, we shoot! Stop him! Hila, come here! Hila! Release my father! I'm not leaving without my father. Release him or kill me. Enough, they're crazy. Go back upstairs. No, Dad! Move. Move! Where do you think you're going? Sit down. Do you want money? Hello? My name is Nathanel Brenner. Listen carefully to what I say so that you can pass it on. We have kidnapped the three criminal billionaires. We demand to speak on TV. If three TV crews don't arrive immediately, we will slaughter them. Don't mess with us. You saw what happened to the cameraman. Who's standing guard? - I am. Messages for Danny. It's me. I'm driving there. I guess you are too. Amir. Hi, Amir. I just wanted to tell you that tonight is our night. It's our war. Yaron? Ido, what's up? On my way. So am I. Okay, bye. Bye. It's easy to dehydrate here. Drink. Thanks. Come in. They're sending the cameramen. Yotam, the cameramen are coming. Get ready. Do you have the text? You've learned it by heart? I prefer reading it. I'm afraid I'll get confused. Maybe someone else can read it? Perhaps you? There's no one else. Out of all of us, only you are worthy of this. '"Amnon Zahavi, age 55. '"2.7 billion.

We're taking photos for the newspaper. Until the TV crew gets here. Hey! Shoot this. What are you doing? More. More. More. More. What are you doing here? Ariel got here first, before everybody else. Come on. Briefing. I went to the lawyer's. I signed everything. Well done, hero. The surgery in on Tuesday. I'm going to the briefing. May I? May I also have some? This son of a bitch isn't an Arab. And also this son of a bitch isn't an Arab. This guy is worth 3 billion. You counted? Danny told me. How's your wife doing? - Good. Want me to send you to her? You wish. Where's the photo of the girl? Nathanel, the son of the Regional Judge Brenner. A member of the Socialist Struggle. Arrested during illegal demonstrations. He gives the orders. Yotam: He's the waiter who shot the cameraman. He's been catering here for six months, collecting information. He served as an officer in the paratrooper unit. Neutralize him first. Michael: A militant in the Avant-Garde radical organization many years ago. Arrests, demonstrations, interrogations. He's known. Oded, the old guy's son. All sorts of activities: Against the Separation Wall, Let the Animals Live, nonsense. We don't know who she is. We're dealing with terrorists here. Not Arabs. Jews. Inside there are very important hostages. Pillars of our country. People who hold this country together. We'll be moving through two routs. The parking squad: Four flights of stairs, parking, staircase, stay close to the corridor walls. The staircase squad... Watch out, there are a lot of noise outside. I counted at least 10 different voices. That means there are a lot more. What's going on outside? Nothing. Enough! What's all this nonsense? A bunch of children living off their parents, playing with guns. You're a killer baby. I'd lock you up in a pound for life. You, don't you have anything better to do than play with your son? Don't you have a job? Who the hell are you? You perverts... My father says: '"Who do you think you are? '" Megalomaniac babies who think they know how to rule the world.

You don't have a face, you have makeup. You don't have breasts, you have a matching lace bra. You don't have a body, you have a dress which you're willing to kill and die for. This... is the size of your personality. This is the most personal thing that has ever and will ever happen to you. And if you happen to get out of here alive, you will only continue to die. You will continue to oppress the slaves in your father's salt factory and to be a slave yourself. A father's daughter, a husband's wife, a children's mother and someone's mistress. I'm not scared of you, you midget. The police will save us and kill you. And if by any chance you'll end up in jail, you'll be released in 20 years, miserable, ugly.

I'll be dead, you'll be dead, you'll all be dead. Now, throw away your guns and follow me outside. Nathanel, listen to me. If you're dead, no one will hear you. Come with me.
