Since I have already departed the world of the living, you might consider this my final act as [inaudible]. Be that as it may, it does give me profound pleasure to know that I can still have a decided effect on the destiny of my three sons. My sons, my incredibly disappointing offspring, who by your standards are entitled to my earthly possessions. So be it. But let them leave that spoiled, self-centered, sophisticated world they call civilization, and return once again to my world. There I fought the elements, and with my sweat and sacrifice carved an empire for my sons. In life I couldn't hold you, my sons. But in death I can once again call you back to your home. Come back Michael, Geoffrey, James. Come back to my world of Boca Nueva, for only there can you claim my wealth. And only there can you learn the truth of my hate. [motorbikes driving] Hey, Mr. Noble, watch this. I'm watching. You're looking pretty good there, Gordon. I think you could pull up on the handlebars a little more. You might have had a better jump than last time. Yeah, I hit kind of hard. [honking] This arrived at the office for you. Marked urgent, so I thought I'd better bring it right out. Thanks, Bennett. How about the Carter building? Those, uh, plans come through yet? Yes, sir. We should definitely start construction next week. The planning board OK'ed our final changes. Well, that's good news. Listen, be sure somebody notifies George's crew, OK? Certainly will. [motorbike driving] Last year that boy was a member of a cycle gang. Pretty rough. Somehow the rest of the kids convinced him that dirt bike racing was a challenging sport. Last month he was county champ. How long have you been working with those boys? Oh, about three years. They needed a man to spend some time, sort of a substitute father. Well, I better get back to the office. OK, I'll see about 3:00. [popping] [MUSIC- THE FIVE O'CLOCK WORLD, "HAND IN HAND"] THE FIVE O'CLOCK WORLD: [singing] And we [inaudible] evil with peace and harmony. We all walk different highways, so it's true. Evil well-defined is the fault of all mankind. Do they know just what they do? Let us pray for a way to see love in every man. Let us pray for a new day when we'll all walk hand-in-hand. If we Boast in our foolish pride and stop to look around, we would see the sands of time go slipping by. Our lives are nearly gone. There won't be another dawn. Comes the day when we almost die. Let us pray for a way to see love in every man. Let us pray for a new day when we'll all walk hand-in-hand. So to every fellow man who walks upon this hallowed land, now's the time to change the way of life you lead. Be brothers to the end, and be everybody's friend. That's the way of life we need. Let us pray for a way to see love in every man. Let us pray for a new day when we'll all walk hand-in-hand. [music playing] MUSIC: Why can't I, if it's so easy, why can't I find love lingering near? Not the simple spoken love I often hear. In hungered quest for love, my heart on my sleeve, giving all too willingly, a love I never received. Carry me away. Let the 5:00 world go by. Take my heart; lead on. Never gazing. Never gazing back through the dawn. Why can't I find love? God knows I've tried. To find perfection in love we have to be blind. Carry me away. Let the 5:00 world go by. Lead on; leave my heart behind. Never gazing. Never gazing back through the dawn. You keep this stuff up, baby, you're going to have more in your hands than you can handle. I wouldn't be so sure about that, Geoffrey, baby. You might have more on your hands than you can handle. [music playing] Are you crazy? My boyfriend's over there. How about the house? OK, Geoffrey. Great. You fool. Huh, yeah. [music playing] Up and away. -Wee! Ha ha. Huh. Oh, stop it. [laughter] [inaudible] put on him. [knocking] Go away! [knocking] Go away! [knocking] Ugh. Ha ha ha. Now, what's so damn important you got to bother me right now? Well, somebody dropped this telegram off for you. Well, drop it. Read it. Imperative you return to Boca Nueva immediately to claim legacy left by your father. See ya later, baby. We've got to find Jack. I, uh, just got a telegram. We're going back to Boca Nueva. What in the hell's been going on here? He tried to rape me. [music playing] Ooh! Ah! Ah! Look out! Ah! Oh! Ah! [music playing] [theme music] [bird chirping] [music playing] God, I hate it here. I've always hated it. Let's get the hell out of here. We should be on our way to Boca Nueva right now! Michael, well, we cannot afford to charter a boat! We have just enough money to pay the hotel bill, and get back to the states. So how do you propose we get there? Swim around the island? We just have to try to be patient until we can get one of those little fishing boats. I should have gone over that. I knew it. I should have gone over that. Well, I should have stayed in New York. You'd prefer that, wouldn't you? Come on, Jenny. Jenny, things are going to be so different now. I mean there's a fortune waiting for us. And we're sitting here like a couple of gringo tourists. [laughter] Cuanto pesos, senorita? Cinco pesos, senora. Gracias. You know what I-- I just can't figure out? For the life of me, I can't figure out what the old man had in mind. Maybe he felt guilty. Maybe he was trying to make it all up to you. Yeah, but why stash it all out here I'm in the middle of nowhere? Anyway listen, anyone with his business sense would have invested it, or-- or put it in a bank, or-- or at least a trust fund. Why did he give it all to me? I mean he never did a-- a damn thing for me in his whole life. It always-- It was always Geoffrey. Geoffrey. Geoffrey and Jimmy. Oh, Michael, be fair. Jim did all right for himself without anybody's help. What do you mean by that? Nothing. [music playing] Um. Why didn't you marry him? Because I married you. Huh. Michael, look. Look out there. Isn't that Geoffrey's boat? Oh! What the hell is he doing here? Did you? I didn't tell him a thing! Well, how else could he have known? Maybe he doesn't know. Oh, I suppose he just happened by here. Huh? He just happened to drop in! Michael, I don't know how he happened by. But he doesn't know that we're here! Well, I'll tell you what, why don't we just go and find out what's happening? Oh no, let's go back to the hotel. Oh no, no, no. We are on vacation. Now, you got that? We are enjoying the friendly atmosphere. Oh! We are enjoying [inaudible]. And we are moving inland, right away! [music playing] Come on. Come. Watch over there, Fred. I know. Well, my, my, what a pleasant surprise. What are you doing here? We're on vacation. What about you? Come on aboard! Sorry. Watch out Watch out. Jenny, you get more beautiful every time I look at you. Thanks. How about a cool drink? Oh, no thanks, Jeff. We just had one. What are you doing here, Geoffrey? Well, I was planning on asking you the same thing, Michael. I thought you were going to spend the winter in New York. That's funny. That's what I thought you were doing. Well, I was planning to. MICHAEL: But? After dear your father died, I figured a little cruise, maybe a change of scenery or something. [laughter] What's so funny? Well, if you can't join, fight 'em, right? MICHAEL: What's that supposed to mean? Oh, you're both ridiculous. Geoffrey, Michael just wants to know why you're really here. Well, I told you. It's just a vacation. He's here for the same reason you are. The hell you are. I got the letter. See? Right here. All nice, all legal. You're wasting your time, brother. There's nothing here for you. Nothing! Damn him! I should have known. Before he died, he said everything was to be for me, everything. Well, I'm sorry brother, but he told me the same thing. You're a liar. There's enough for both of us, Michael. Oh, I don't think there's enough of anything for either of you. Jenny you underestimate my generosity. But not your motives. Your generosity isn't the issue. We're talking about something that belongs to me, you got that? OK, Michael. Let's make a deal. [michael laughing] When you think about it Michael, I've got a boat ready to go Could be on our way in less than an hour. MICHAEL: Good, you staying at the hotel? Why don't you go over and check out and get your things? We'll gas up and we'll get on the way. You, uh, Make yourself at home, Jenny. I'll pick up some gas. [music playing] Can we give you a hand, Mr. Noble? Yeah, thanks. [grunts] [singing] [speaking spanish] OK, you guys tie up the skiff and we'll get on our way. Bill, get ready to cast off, will ya? Wait a-- Where's Michael? Michael said to go on without him. Well, why? I don't know, he said something about getting a guy and going over land to see us. He is over there. I'll take these bags below. Okay, you guys, let's get lines off! [groaning] That's the man I was telling you about, inspector. [speaking spanish] Are you all right? Ah-- Allow me to handle things myself. Inspector Luis at your service. Oh. Oh, my-- my papers, I-- I-- I can't find my papers. Well, senor, I think you need a doctor more, no? No, no you don't understand. I've been robbed. But who do this to you? I must make a report, senor. Eh, senor, eh? Noble. My name is Michael Noble. Ah, si. Eh, you are one of the sons of the late Roberto Noble, the coffee plantation. Yes, but please, there's no time for that now. I must get to the boat landing. Por favor, allow me, I will take you, ah? Come. [speaking spanish] [inaudible] Quick, get the doctor,ah? Hey, hey you down there. Where's the boat? The big boat? [speaking spanish] On the other side of the island? You heard? It went to the other side of the island. My wife is on that boat. She's been kidnapped. I've got to get her. Senor, por favor, first we take care of your wound. Then, you come to the headquarters, we make a report-- There's no time for that. Do you have a boat? Si. Well, good, you take me. Oh, but that is impossible. But, why? It is against the regulations. The hell with regulations! Didn't I just tell you, my wife has been kidnapped. Okay, you did Tell me. Okay, now look. You take me to Boca Nueva right now, and I promise you, I'll make it very worth your while. Senor, first I must make a report. [speaking spanish] It is not very nice for you to try and take somebody else's boat. Please, you come with me, ah? What is this, Senor? [speaking spanish] Your Spanish is pretty good, Senor. Is this your first visit to our island? No, I've been here before. Good Easter, si? No, my father used to, uh, own a coffee plantation around the other side of the island, just outside of Boca. You're the old Indian, right? Si. What is your father's name, senor? Noble. Robert Noble. I've heard that name before. You're going to see him now, si? No, he passed away recently, and I-- I've got a little unfinished business to take care of. I'm sorry, Senor. Oh, by the way, can you tell me how to rent a boat to get around to the other side of the island? I was gonna go over land by jeep, but they tell me at the airport that all the roads are washed out. The rains have been bad this year. As for a boat, Senor, I do not think you have luck. No? The moon is right. All the men are out fishing. Well, I don't know what to do. We have a hotel, Senor. The time could pass very quickly. Perhaps too quickly. I'm sure it would, Senorita. Magdalena. That's a very pretty name, Magdalena. But I really do have to get a boat as soon as possible. You Americans. You don't understand how to take time to leave your life. Wait a minute, I'll be passing back through Carmen in a few days. You can show me around then. How will you get to Boca? I can't hike, that's for sure. --[inaudible] Better luck by jee but that would be impossible. Have you got any other suggestions? Maybe Pablo, one of the fishermen. A lazy muchacho. Always manana, manana. What about him? Well, he was planning to go to fish tomorrow. Maybe he would take you to Boca. Well, where do I find this, uh, what's his name? Pablo. Pablo Gutares Down at um, down-- [inaudible] Something wrong, Senor? No, no. There used to be a Gutares family that worked for my father's and his coffee plantation. They had a young son. His name was Pablo. But that's been many, many years ago. Anyhow, how do I find this fellow, Magdalena? Well, he was fooling with his boat at the end of the pier about an hour ago. Muchas gracias, senorita. How much do I owe you for the coffee? Ah, as you Americans say, Senor, it's on the roof. You mean, it's on the house. Ah, si. I'll be waiting, Senor Noble. Adios. Ay, Pablo. Ay, Senor Tim! You have not been here in long time. I grew up. Now big. Strong like you. Hey, you come on the plane from Guatemala City, Senor? Si, Pablo. Can you help me? I need a boat to get to the island. Boat, no, Senor. Everyone fishing now, maybe one, two weeks. Then, plenty of boats. As a favor to an old friend, a hundred pesos. Who wants to fish? Si, Senor, first thing in the morning -Now. Now, but it would-- OK. We go. [music playing] Are we there? No, not yet. Let's see now. Boca Nueva is about two miles inland. And we're going to have to wait until morning to get in, so I suggest that we anchor in the bay and get a good night's rest. Would you care for a drink? But I thought we were going ashore to meet Michael tonight. Well, we can't. The tide is out, we can't risk the reefs. Now don't worry, will you, Jenny? I'm not worried, but I don't want to goaway. You know, it's a strange thing. What? Oh. A girl like you married a man like Michael. Well, I suppose I thought his being your brother, he might be more like you. Kind and generous. I may not be sentimental, but at least I'm a success. I-- I know what I want in life, and I always get it. Oh, do you really? You could be part of it, Jenny. Part of what? My life. First class all the way. Well, you're forgetting a few things, aren't you, Geoffrey? Besides, you have got to realize that you can't buy everything. Like what? Like me. [airplane passing] Now what are you thinking? I wish I were on that plane on the way home. God, how did three such totally different men come from the same family? Didn't know my father very well. Your father. I am so sick of hearing about your father. When I married Michael, I married a whole situation. You married the wrong end of the situation. You should have married me, Jenny. Well, you didn't ask me. I'm asking you now. We'll spend the night here. What do you say, Jenny? [door slams] Excuse me, inspector. Que paso? The Americano seems to be resting well. Ah, but where is Dr. Roma? I sent Pablo for him an hour ago. I must talk to Senor Noble, find out what is going on here. [inaudible] It's hot in here. Why don't you come over and sit down. Have a drink. You're worried about Michael. No. He can take care of himself. You know, you interest me. I don't think you give a damn about anything or anybody, including Michael. Is that what you think? I know where I'm going. It's you I'm wondering about. Oh, Jeff. If you have something on your mind, why don't you just go ahead and say it. I'm in no mood for your [inaudible]. I'm trying to tell you that I love Jenny. This is where I [inaudible]. Wait a minute, Jenny. There's no one here to impress. We're alone. That's right, we're alone. You're alone and I'm alone. Now let's just leave it that way. [MUFFLED] Geoffrey! You're meant to be alone! What the hell's that matter with you anyway? [inaudible] Michael. --[inaudible] a dramatic rescue by Michael, forget it. Because Michael-- Michael's what? Michael's what? Michael-- We're going to be gone a couple of hours. Keep the girl below. All right. Okay, Fred, let's go. [speaking spanish] [hissing] MAN: Hello, there! MAN 2: -Beat it, mister. This is Geoffrey Noble's boat, is it? Well, he ain't here. Where is he? We don't want any strangers around either. Oh, Jim. Jim! I Tie him up, Pablo. Jim, oh, Jim. Thank God you're here. [laughter] Is there anybody else on board? No, no but listen. I think something's happened to Michael. Geoffrey went to Boca for supplies. Wait a minute, wait a minute where is Michael? That's just the point, Jim I don'tknow where Michael is. We were supposed to meet him ashore last night. Then Geoffrey gave me the feeling that something awful happened. Nothing Geoffrey says will surprise me. Now, listen. I promise you we'll find Michael. But right now I've gotta get ashore. All right, [inaudible]. Yeah, what do you know about that? Well, Michael and Geoffrey have the same thing. We're gonna be going through some pretty rough country. Have you got some other clothes? [speaking spanish] Well, he won't be going anywhere without a spark plug. Maybe he's good [inaudible], Senor. Here. C'mon, that a girl. You made it. [growling] [hissing] [speaking spanish] [gunshots] [speaking spanish] [gunshot] Senor Michael Noble. You cannot make it through the jungle. I will be waiting for you. Do you hear me? [gunshot] We go ashore here, Senor? No, further down. OK. Pedro. Si? You have [inaudible] to a big boat. Americano? Oh, si. Big boat take much [inaudible]. And rent small boat. What was the man's name? Senor Noble. Ah, si? Si. Which way did the boat go? Uh, towards B-- Boca. Senor Noble. Boca. Who was on the boat with Senor Noble? Uh, beautiful lady who was with gold hair. Anyone else on the boat? Ah? Two men. And what happened? What happened? I don't-- I don't understand. After you sell the gasoline, what happened? Two men go away and come back with two bags. And then I go. [speaking spanish] Pedro. Si. How much did you charge the Gringos for the gasoline in a small boat? Senor Inspector, [inaudible] Now suddenly everybody must go to Boca. I must go to Boca, too, before I can finish my report. If you hire my boat for 500 pesos, Senor, why we not use it now? You wanted to come along. Of course I come. I have curiosity not a [inaudible]. With a nose, they can smell money a mile away. You make big joke, Senor. [inaudible] this is no joke. You all right? Yeah. You sure? Yeah. I am, really. Let's go on. What the hell happened? -There were two of 'em. -Who was it? I don't know. I never saw 'em before. Where's the woman? They took her with 'em. [inaudible] I think they headed for the beach. They won't be for long. I have the ship. Damn it. Did anybody fool with this boat? I don't know, but they took one of your rifles in the cabin. OK, we'll gas up the skiff and we'll use that, all right? And please, you stay here and try to stay awake. Yes, sir. Jim, Jim, wait. I gotta stop for a minute. Here. What you got? I got one. What? I got one just like you. What do you mean you got one just like this? Like a paper like that. Well, where did you get it? I find it in jungle. In Carmen before I see Senor Jim. The truth, Pablo. A man gave it to me for his service. What's his name? Senor [inaudible]. Very rich man. Pablo, this is no time for jokes. Now tell me exactly where you got it. Well, Senor. Pablo mean no harm. A poor man must live. A fainted man laying in the bushes 'neath the hotel. Beaten badly. Was he dead? I thought that at first, but then I see him and the inspector going to the Doc. Michael. Well, that must be what Geoffrey started to tell me back in the boat. Senor Jim not mad at Pablo. Pablo, you're a liar and a thief. But I'm sure your mother think you're a very good boy. Si, si It is true. Jim, do you think we should go back? Ah, don't worry. Knowing Michael, he's headed where we're headed. Come on, let's go. We're almost there. It's not a good place, Senor. Very bad spirits here. Not even with money. You afraid? Me, afraid? That is a foolish question to ask Pablo. Si, I am afraid! Right on top of that pyramid is where they used to make the human sacrifices. Beautiful, isn't it? Beautiful? No, Senora. All right, we'll settle here for the night. Here? No stay here, Senor. I have funny feeling of this place. We have no choice, Pablo. But-- Start a fire or gather some wood, will you? OK, Senor. But when you wake up in the morning, dead, don't blame Pablo. I don't blame Pablo. This map. Tells us where to come, but not where to look. Well, maybe now that we're here, we can look around and find some clues. OK, I'll make camp first and then we'll give this thing a little closer look, huh? I'm gonna go get cleaned up. All right. Jenny? Jenny? I'll be right back. To my son, James Noble, I herewith leave all my worldly goods. When Dad died, all of his business affairs were settled. Even his bank account, which had been substantial was withdrawn to the penny. No debts, no assets. Mm. [inaudible] Michael's [inaudible]. Even though he's only been dead a few months, I-- I can hardly remember him. Never expressed any emotion. When my mother died, he treated it exactly as he would have the death of one of his hunting dogs. He had a deliberate rhythm which nothing could upset or disturb. [scoff] I don't think we affected him, at all. I'm not so sure about that. He must have gotten religion in the end. Listen to this. Where your treasure house is, there is your heart also. Gospel according to St. Matthew. Jim, why did you come here? Isn't it obvious? No. Oh, I don't know. I-- I was raised on stories of pirates, jewel thieves, international intrigue. And buried treasure. Yeah, yeah, I guess that entered into it somewhere along the line. Money's never really been important to me. Could I see the [inaudible] please? You happy? What do you mean am I happy? With Michael, I mean? Well, [inaudible] one way or the other. You're a puzzling woman. Why? Everything seems to pass over you like water off a duck's back. When we were in New York together, all of us, before you married Michael, I think I was in love with you. But you were so distant, so-- untouchable. You like women to be aggressive? No, not aggressive. Responsive. Good morning. Good morning. How 'bout some coffee? I'd love it. Thank you. Where your treasure house is, there your heart is also. Jim, the cave. What cave? There's a cave behind the waterfall. I saw it last night when I was-- when I was washing, but it didn't occur to me then. But don't you see? The cave leads to the heart of the mountain. So it might be there. That must be it. C'mon, Pablo, no time for breakfast. C'mon. [inaudible] There must be several thousand dollars in here. How many pesos, Senor? Many pesos, Pablo. Enough for a new fishing boat? There's probably enough there for about ten new fishing boats. Easy, Jim. We don't wanna get blood all over the money, do we? So, you found it, huh? This is it. How much? I haven't counted it yet. Poor Michael. Too bad he won't get a chance to see it. What do you mean, poor Michael? Where is he? What happened to him? Why are you so damn concerned about Michael? Why am I concerned? Because I'm his wife. That's why. You didn't love him and you know it, Jenny. That's none of your damn business. You cheated him, Jenny. He thought you loved him, but you love somebody else. And you grabbed on to Michael when the other guy wouldn't tumble. [inaudible] Because I was naive enough to think you had fallen for me. It was for you, Jenny. It was for you. Let go of me. -And you're part of it, whether you like it or not. That's enough. Stay right there. Do not make a move, Senor. You are a dead man. Take his gun. Your gun, Senor. I have a gun. Pablo, what are you doing with such bad people? You have a gun? No, inspector. Not me. I better look for it myself, huh? Hey, suddenly you're an honest man. Why don't you tell the truth, ah? Senor. Michael Noble, where is he? I haven't the slightest idea. Then what are you all doing here in the cave at Boca? Ah. Suddenly it becomes clear, ah? Where there is greed, you will find murder. Murder? Or a beautiful woman. Your husband is a murderer, Senora. Michael. He has already killed two of my men. Well, is he all right? Captain. The inspector, por favor. Inspector. This money is rightfully and legally mine. It was left to me by my father. His father also left it to his brother, Michael, and me. This paper is very interesting. But my government owns this land and everything in it. Are you crazy? Oh no, Senor. I am not crazy. Shrewd old buzzard. We never gave him anything. Always had our hands out, though. So before he died, he figured out this little scheme to bring us all together and show us what we were really like as human beings. It's our treasure house, all right. Hearts and minds full of greed and hate. Inspector, if you turn that over to the government, you won't get a cent. Sometimes one duty becomes very hard. What's your price? All of it, Senor. All of it. I claim it in the name of my government. Uh, are we under arrest? Oh, no, Senor. You are free to go. After I make my report. A report? Oh, si, my government is very particular. I must make a report for everything. Now, I think it would be wise if we all go on. [gunshot] Cover her! Well, do something. Send some of your men up there. No, I've already lost two of my men. I do not intend to lose more. [gunshot] I think I should go up and talk to him. It is too dangerous. But, he's my husband. He'll listen to me. Geoffrey! That man is not the man you think is your husband. He has come through the jungle from Carmen. An impossible feat for a normal man. I'll talk to him. Maybe I can reason with him. I do not think so. I know him pretty well, Inspector. What other choice do we have? As you wish. [gunshot] I gotta get out of here. I would advise you, Senor, to stay right here. I'll be damned if I'm staying around here. He's after me. Well, what the hell are you doing, anyway? What are you doing, Senor? Geoffrey! [gunshot] Michael! Get out of here! C'mon, Mike, let's go. What for? You are a lousy, useless two-bit halfbreed. Oh, Geoffrey! Nobody's out of [inaudible] Where's Jeff? He grabbed the gun and ran off that way. Idiot. You stay with the inspector, I'm going after him. Senor, I do not care if the three of you shoot each other. That is your business. But Michael Noble has killed two of my men. That makes him my business. Well, stay with Pablo. Inspector, a gun for me, no? No, Pablo. You might shoot yourself. Or worse, still, you might shoot me. Vamos. MICHAEL [VOICEOVER]: Geoffrey, where are you? [laughter] Geoffrey, Geoffrey! [laughter] Geoffrey! Geoffrey! Geoffrey! Wait up! Geoffrey, wait for me! Geoffrey, I'm gonna get you. I see you! [laughter] Geoffrey! [inaudible] Hey, Michael. Michael-- I'm your brother, Michael. [gunshot] Jimmy. It's so good to see you. It's all over, Mike. Jenny's waiting. C'mon. Jenny? Is she all right? She loves you. It's true. I knew it when-- when I married her. I was always afraid she'd find out, an-- and, uh, and leave me. Senor, I have been watching all of you. I think your father was a very wise man. Ah, I will take care of this. [speaking spanish] Now, I must make a report. Jim! [footsteps] Jim. They're dead, Jenny. Both of 'em. Michael? Michael's dead? [inaudible] [music playing]
