This film is based on a true story, but the characters are fictitious. Men become criminals not because they want to but because they're driven to crime by poverty and necessity. Ten-Si, Chinese thinker, 5th century BC Hey, Jaro. Here to see your brother? - Obviously. - Did his trial come up? Ah. - How long is his sentence? - Seven years. Wow. If he'd chosen me as his lawyer... Jose Manuel Gomez Perales. - My turn to go in. - Goodbye, kid. And if you need a good lawyer, look me up. Before Jose Manuel Gomez Perales, alias 'EI Jaro' was 16 years old he had been charged with the following crimes: 500 purse snatches, 400 garage break-ins, 200 stolen cars, 3 bank robberies, 50 store holdups, and more than 80 pedestrian muggings. He escaped 29 times from reformatories, and was wounded three times during confrontations with the law. THUGS So what do you do? Where do you sleep? Doorways, stolen cars, or some whore's place. And the old lady? You seen her? As long as she's screwing that pimp, I'm not interested. She can fuck off! Okay, Jaro. But remember Dad left her a long fucking time ago. It's normal for a woman to look for a substitute. - Maybe it's normal to you. - So what, you're not living this life? I'm where I got left. Jaro! Fucking hurry it up! Hey! You know what this means? No idea. Death to the police and long live crime. What a smart-ass. You're terrible. - The things you say. - What's wrong? You into pigs or what? Those sons of bitches? No way. Well I give all the cops in Madrid heart attacks. Heart attacks, babe. Heart attacks. Get out of here! You're not such a big deal. I'm not? Well if you know a cop, ask him who Jaro is. You know what? When you came on to me in the Rastro, I almost said no way. - Why, babe? - What do you mean why? - Because you're a kid. - A kid? I'm just 16, but I have a "tail" longer than the Pink Panther's. Okay? Fuck me if it's okay! - What's up? Getting high? - We got some really good hash. - Take another fucking hit. It's amazing! - I'm done, I'm done. And guys cut the shit. I need to tell you something. Fuck off, Jaro. Don't kill our buzz. We're so fucking stoned. Yeah. If we're stoned all day we'll never get out of this rut. But dude, with all the stuff we've been doing... What stuff? We need to get our act together. I'm fucking sick of snatching purses, busting open phone booths, and all that bullshit. It's just like when we steal a car. We drive around in circles until we run out of gas. - And then what? - Well I think it's fun as hell! Sure, since your life is taken care of, you come here to look cool. That's all. But us... We're making a living for ourselves and we have to do a better job. - That's for damn sure. But today! - Fucking right! Butano, you get me! And what did you have in mind, dude? - Holy shit! A sawed-off shotgun! - That's awesome! - Where'd you get it? - That doesn't matter. But with this little toy, things are gonna be different. No more being suckers. You're the shit, Jaro! You're the real shit! - Hello. - Hello, pretty boys. What are you doing around here? Come on, get lost. We're not into this shit. And you might get scared. - There's nothing that scares us. - Fuck off already! - What's up? - Hi, Johnny. Not much. Checking out what's going on. Same as always. Fags and pimps. Right, the usual. - So are you up for a beer? - Cool! - For less than 1,000, forget it. - 1,000 is too much. Well, anyway, I felt like changing gigs. Breaking into cars starts to be fucked up once you're 16. If you get busted, you go to jail. Weren't you gonna get a job? I've been looking, dude, but there's no work out there. - Well, here we are. - So you're a fag now or what? Me, a fag? If they give you 1000 pesetas to suck your dick, fine with me. Plus, you can always rip off one of those old fossils. Without worrying about them calling the cops. And can you get a lot off them? Sometimes, but I prefer to be cool. Because it's pretty shitty, right? Stabbing some old guy who was saving all week to make 1000 to suck off some guy. It might be shitty, but there's some fags with lots of bread. Look, tonight I'm going to go see this queer who has a villa in Puerta de Hierro. This really weird guy who does strange stuff with costumes and music, but he pays a shitload. Where'd you say his villa was? Tonight we're going to have a dance contest! - Cool, play some Boney M. - Forget that, cutie! It's going to be a Schottische contest. - You got it? Schottische! - Schottische! Nobody knows how to dance a Schottische. Needless to say, Madrid isn't what it used to be. There aren't even any guys left who know how to dance the Schottische. Play it. I'll show them how to dance the Schottische on a single tile. And slow dancing. Before that, I want to introduce you to the queen of the jamboree. Here's a real autumn flower. These high-heels are killing me! Come on. You really kept this surprise to yourself! I'm afraid this number wasn't in the program. You cynic! We know you well. Play the music, I'll dance with the blond with the shotgun. Come on, get out your money, your watches, your rings, and everything of value. And be quiet! Let's go! Among the over a million and a half currently unemployed in our country, more than 45 percent are youths. Almost 50 percent of those arrested over the past few months are under 18 years of age. Those idiots are cops. Fuck off. Looking like that, they gotta be cops. Yeah, man, I've seen them three times. Then we better get out of here. If we get caught up in all this... Take the bags with the loot and take off without getting pissed. What's up? You staying here or what? - Yes, I'm meeting the whore. - Sure. They might arrest you, dude. No way! - I'll keep this. - But the shotgun's in there. If they catch you with it, you're screwed. It's not a problem. Come on, get out of here. Up to you, dude. I'm definitely out of here. Come on, what are you waiting for? Be careful, dude. It looks like they're leaving. Let them go. That guy's face looks familiar. Let's go see. Police. Your ID card. I'm not old enough to have a card. And what are you doing here now? - Just having a lemon ice cream. - What's in there? - Where? - In the bag. Ah, sports stuff. So you're into sports? Yeah, karate. - And what belt are you? - Brown. I'm a black belt. Third degree. - I assume there's a karate gi inside? - Naturally. Let's see what it looks like. What's wrong with this zipper? It gets stuck sometimes. - Let me do it. - Easy, easy, I'll open it. Hi. How are you, Martinez? - Hello. - Wow! Been a long time. How are you? - Damn. It's the Mexican. - How's life? I came here to meet this young man. He's my nephew. - How are you, kid? - Yeah, yeah. - So he's your nephew, huh? - Yes, he's my sister Maria Angeles' son. - I never introduced you to him before? - What's up? You're into kids now? You already know I'm into grown men like you. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're such a whore, Mexican! The biggest! Almost as much as your mother. You're so funny, Martinez! - So funny. - Mexican, Mexican. Don't mess with me, or I'll take you in, huh? That would be a shame. Just the other day I was thinking about you. A fellow Mexican arrived, a young girl, an inexperienced girl, and I said to myself, "This one's for Martinez." - And does she go to the club? - Every day. One of these nights we'll pay you a visit. Let's see if you remember me too. I always remember my friends. Come on, let's go. Have a good day. Bye. - Bye. - See you later. Shh, relax. You can wrap them around your finger. It comes with experience. This guy's more on the take than anyone else. He's got three girls working for him at the club. And if only it were just him. What a bunch of pimps. We're very sorry for your loss. Thank you very much, but it's been ten years since my poor Tomasa passed. I come every Saturday to visit her and pray a little. Could you lend us ten bucks to catch the bus? Okay. Give us everything you have! - Don't move! - Hand it over! Come on. - Fuck off! - Let's get out of here. That sucker only had two bucks. Well, his ring is shit, plus we won't get anything for the watch. And on top of that, you give him back his glasses. I gave them back to him because I fucking felt like it. - What's the problem? - Nothing, dude. Up to you. Whatever. And where's Jaro? He hasn't shown his face for three days. - Bet he's screwing the Mexican slut. - That Mexican is going to dry him out. It's not so easy to dry out Jaro. Well, tonight he'll stop by the club to get some fresh pussy. How's it going, Jaro? You like that chick? - A lot. - Well, she's my sister. Yeah? Tell her she has a drink on me. No, man, she's not that desperate. - What's wrong, is she a prude? - No way! Thing is, Toñi's into big shots. - Why's that? - She's always really high, you know? She needs guys who can get her going. Hash, LSD, and you wouldn't believe how she gobbles speed. She even shoots up. Fuck! Well, tell her I'll get her going as much as she wants. So you're EI Jaro. I never thought of you like this. - You look like a good boy. - Okay, and you look like a hot girl. Don't laugh like that. You're killing the mood. It's just that you make me laugh! Your problem is you're so high you don't even know what you're doing. Feel like going out for a drive? Hey, are you up for it? Fuck! - Okay, Jaro. Let's go already. - But Toñi, you can't leave me like this. I feel inhibited. Don't you have a little hash to make a joint? No, nothing at all. What's up? You don't smoke or what? - Yes, but not a lot. - Not into it? I'm into it, but I don't like being high all day. Or my friends get out of control. You gotta be on your game to rip people off. - You can't be high. - That's your problem. I'm into blowing everything off. Take me to the disco. I'm sure I'll find some guys there with really good hash. If I want, in one hour you'll have all the hash you could smoke in a year. You don't believe me? You'll see. I said in one hour. Man, Jaro. It' 5 been a long time! Hey, Marquis. I need to talk to you. - What's wrong? - Nothing. You keep asking me to work for you. And I've made up my mind. Very good, man. Very good. Let's go upstairs. You have to give me 10,000 pesetas for this. You have four days to sell it and bring me the money. - Okay. - You can cut it into 20 pieces. So if you do it right, you can keep 10 for yourself. I don't recommend going to the Boulevard de Vallecas. Too much competition with all the other dealers. I know, I won't be going there. You're a smart kid, Jaro. If you play it straight with me, we can do good business. Here, I'll wrap it up for you. Get some more paper because I'm going to take it all. All of it, you got me? I'm taking it all. It's only natural for you to fall in love with a young girl. - How old is she? - Twenty. Twenty? Well, she's not so young. Five years older than you. - It makes me want to say something silly. - Well, say it. - I'm jealous. - Why? Because of what I said about Toñi? It's my fault. I have many dreams. Don't worry about it. She's always totally high and doesn't even fucking listen to me. All she's into is doing drugs. I'm just a ridiculous old lady who walks the streets looking for young kids. You make me feel so young. So young that every time I sleep with you I feel like it's my first time doing it. - Hello. - Hello. - What do you want? - Listen. It's just that I have a really bad toothache. What can you give me? I'll give you some Melabon pills. That will calm you down. No way! No way! It hurts like hell. Couldn't you give me some Metasedin? Metasedin? What are you talking about? That's 80 percent morphine. Besides, without a prescription it's impossible. Don't worry, if you give me 10 or 12 boxes I can manage. Are you crazy? Why would I give you that? Didn't you hear my buddy? His tooth hurts a lot. Give him everything he asks for. Come on, lady! Hi, Herminio. It's Toñi. Okay. Nothing, my brother and his friends managed to get that thing. Quite a lot, I think. Yeah. I know where. Okay. We'll be there at 8. What's up with that? The stuff you get ripping off pharmacies isn't easy to sell. Every day 4 or 5 get robbed, so there's tons of it. Cut the crap, Herminio. How much will you pay? - 20 tops. - Just 20 thousand? That's bullshit, Herminio. I know how much morphine goes for. That's really all I can pay. - At most I can give you some free acid. - How much? - Half a dozen. - That's nothing. A dozen. 10. If you're interested. If not, forget it. - How's the acid? - Really good. Pure LSD. No speed. I guarantee fourteen hours of hallucinations. Are we doing this or not? - I'm gonna drop my acid now. - Me too. Aren't there too many people? - No, dude. - No way! If we take it now, we'll be high in half an hour. We'll be tripping through the whole concert. - Let's see it. - Here. - You're sure there's no speed? - Careful it doesn't fall. Come on. Swallow it. Nooo! - Nooo! - Hit her! Bitch! - Sons of bitches. - Let's go get those bastards. Drop it, Jaro. Don't get involved. - Forget it. It's not our business. - It's not? Hey, motherfuckers, let's see if you dare fight us. If you take one more step, I'll drop you right there. If you have balls, leave your sticks and helmets and we'll fight with our fists. I bet you have knives. You also have a shotgun. If you drop the sticks and the helmets, we'll drop the knives and the gun. Why should we trust you? Because we're more legit than you motherfuckers. - And if we don't agree? - If you don't agree, here are two rounds, one for you and another for whoever needs one. Take that! Careful, Jaro! Don't move or I'll ice you! I told you not to move. It's not loaded, asshole! Of the juvenile delinquents arrested in the last year, only 2 percent lived in upscale urban areas. 5 percent in well-located neighborhoods, socially speaking. 19.5 percent in middle class homes. The remaining 73.5 percent were young boys who lived in the outskirts. In all, 88% of the juveniles arrested were sons of blue collar laborers. - You're sure there's someone here now? - Yeah, Jaro. Almost all the whores on the Gran Via take their johns there. Those guys are here already. Fuck, Toñi, you're looking good! Didn't you want me to dress like a slut? - Well, look. - Come on, don't mess around. - What do you want? - We want a room. For both of you? Have your ID cards? - No. - Then there's no room. We don't accept underage kids here. Get going. Come on, get in there! - PoHce! - Everyone out! Police! Let's go! Everyone out! - Everyone out in the hall! - Let's go, everyone out! Come out of there! Hurry up, against the wall! - Come on, out of there! - PoHce! Let's go, open up! - That's it! - What is this? Why isn't that door opening? Hey, everybody out in the hallway. Step on it! Get out of there! You just follow orders. Show me that wallet! Jarocho. Let's get out of here! Come on! Come on, let's go! Let's go! Man, what's wrong with you? Why stop? We had everything under control. - We have to get out of here. - Why? I had my eye on this great watch. Fuck, the cops! Upstairs! This way. Stop! Don't move! Freeze! Freeze! Hey, coppers! We have guns too! - What do we do? - They have weapons. We'd better go down and call for backup. I'm going to lock this so they can't get out. They locked us up here. They went for backup. - What now, Jaro? - This way! Come on! And one and two, three and four. And one two, one two, three. And one, two, three and four. - Who are you? What do you want? - Don't worry. - You'll be okay if you help us. - Help you do what? - Escape. - But... what can we do? For now, keep playing the piano, lady, like nothing's happening. - Let's go, play the piano! - Go on, go on. And you girls dance. I said dance! Come on girls, come on, come on! Let's go. One, two... one, two... One, two... One, two... One, two... And... One, two... One, two... One, two... But Lara, how could they have gotten away from you? When I arrived they were already gone. They probably escaped via the building next door. We did everything we could. We even surrounded the block. I don't want excuses, Lara. I'm sick of getting complaints about Jaro and his gang. We have to catch them any way we can and fast. We're working on it, Commissioner. But you know, these guys are irrational and suicidal. Plus, since they know that at their age they won't go to jail, they get bolder. Come on, send that woman in. Carmela Perales. Follow me. - Who's that lady? I never saw her before. - She's Jaro's mother. You want me to believe that it was a coincidence that you ran into your son at that boarding house? Yes, sir, I didn't know anything. I never imagined. - Come on, come on, enough lies. - I swear to you, I swear it. I hadn't seen my Jarocho in a long time. - He left home when he was 12. - And you were so relieved, right? Your oldest in jail, your youngest committing robberies, and you were happy to be whoring. No? I... It's so cool to see so many lights, so many streets, fuck, there are so many people in the world, right? What do they do for a living? What the fuck do they do for food? All the dealers and traffickers in Madrid meet at that place. Do they have big stashes? You bet, man. Hash, smack, acid, everything. - We could go check it out. - You're crazy, dude. Those guys are dangerous. - Almost all of them have a piece. - And we have the shotgun. - Come on, man, there's no comparison. - Fuck, Jaro. Didn't you say you passed on doing drugs? You really have a taste for it now. - It looks like Toñi. - I passed on it and I can keep on passing. Besides, I don't know what the hell that has to do with it. Let's go rip off a dealer and take everything he has. What do you say? But things are going great for us. Why go get mixed up with those guys? It's not worth it to me. It is for me. I'm not afraid of those guys. You'll end up harassing us into it and we'll fuck it up. Tonight I'm going to go over there to see what that stuff's all about. We're closed, kid. - I can't serve you anything. - I wanted to buy a little hash. Did someone send you here? No, but some friends told me that maybe you could slip me something. I'm strapped. Hello, Jaro! What a surprise! You see? We finally meet again. Grab him. Keep still. Take it easy, man, take it easy. This time you didn't catch me so unprepared. - Lock the door. - Stay still. Listen, Marquis. I know you're pissed off. Shh... shut your mouth. Like a good little boy. And be still. Don't piss us off. I told you that we'd bump into him. These kids are assholes. If a man did what this one did to me, I'd kill him straight out. But deep down I found it amusing that a kid like you stole 400 grams from me. It was really bad hash, by the way. We sell it in Vallecas to all the jailbait. I didn't care about the money, but the humiliation pissed me off. Because I'm a very sensitive person, you know? But I'm not going to hit you, no way. I only hit men. A kid like you, well... In jail I learned some better forms of revenge, more amusing ones. Come on, lean him against the bar. Kill me if you want. Do whatever the fuck you want, but get it over with. Pull his pants down. Be still or I'll put two bullets in you. Pull his pants down. Let's see what he has. You've never taken it from behind, have you, kid? It's a pity I'm not a faggot. But who knows, I might just like to relive my time in jail. You'll see what they'll do to you when you go there. The kid is going to lose his virginity. I think he's really into it. A piece of ass like that in the can will cause a riot. But to start your training, let me introduce you to Kid Merino, who despite being a former heavyweight champ, is called Mari-trini by his friends. Come on, champ, don't be afraid. Come on, man. What is this? Are we going to do something about this, or what? I'm going to slice those bastards up. What they did to Jaro, it's like they did it to me. They'll pay for it! We warned him not to go there. He was asking for it. Fuck that, dude! Who would have thought the Marquis would be there? This shit is fucked up. What they did to our friend, fuck that. I bet they'll wind up doing it to me from behind one day too. I bet more than one already did. You're such a screw-up. I'm into pussy, dude. It's obvious that you're just mad they did him in the ass without you. - Fucking bastard, you're dead. I'm gonna kick your ass so badly you won't be able to even sell fish again with your old man. We're all friends here, Butano, fuck. - I'll kill him! - No you won't Butano! - I swear to God I'll kill him! - We go after the Marquis and his guys! We'll go tonight. We have to get everyone together. We have to call the guys from Menke's gang, Gasolina's guys, Quique's gang, all of the guys from Chamartín, from La Ventilla, from Tetuán. All of us have to be there. All if us! Is the Marquis here? - Yes, yes. - Get in there, asshole! Here. Hey, little Marquis. Good, huh? Let's fix this place up a little. Don't worry, man. I'm leaving you for the finale. Before that I have a rematch with the champ. So now you're starting to use firearms. - Shotguns and pistols. - The sawed-off's mine, but not the pistol. - Then whose is it? - What do I know? Come on, confess. Where'd you get the pistol? I don't know, it's not mine. I believe the pistol's not yours, but I'm sure you can tell me whose it is. I'm not a rat. I don't snitch to the police. Besides, what do I know? Look, Jaro. We've known each other for a long time, since the first time you were brought here when you were 10 years old. So let's talk like old friends. How about it? - Okay, but tell him to lay off. - Relax. Our patrol cars went to that pub because we thought the whole mess had been organized due to a dispute between dealers. No one imagined that you were mixed up with professionals like that. - What were you doing there? - Nothing, having a drink. Right. And why were all the northern gangs there? We ran into each other. Fucking coincidence. Listen, all these charges are against you, I could make you swallow them all. But I'm willing to forget them. I'm even willing to forget about the sawed-off shotgun. I need you to tell me things. You know a lot about the Marquis and his people. I don't know anything. - Look, Jaro... - I already told you that I'm not a rat. Okay, what about Kid Merino, that nut job they call the Mari-trini? He was hospitalized with his asshole sliced up. He got stabbed right in the ass. Who knows? Look, Jaro, the guy's a total pansy. And he probably deserved what he got, but I'm certain you know everything about what was going on in that place. - That's why I'm telling you... - All I know is that I was having a drink on my own and suddenly there was a scene and the cop cars came and took us all away. Give me ten minutes alone with this one and he'll talk. Let's see if you have the balls to do it, you little shit! What's the point? So the newspapers can say we torture 15-year-old kids here? No. No. We don't need that. You know what I say, Commissioner? It would be best to put these kids back on the street. Let them go. Let all these sons of bitches go free. When a lady comes in saying her purse has been snatched or someone has their car stolen, they can call it democracy and go fuck themselves. Take him to the presiding judge. As soon as I heard that EI Jaro had returned to the reformatory, I was very curious to interview him. For now, to do that eternal story about juvenile delinquency, always repeated, always incomplete, I'll go back to the neighborhood Where he came from. I'll have no choice but to insist again on all those things that seem so utopian, so obvious to the clever civil servants. I'm going to get the hell out of here and fast, that's for sure. I've been in here a shitload of times and I've always gotten out. That's not my problem, Jaro. I'm not a jailer. I'm just a psychologist hired by the reformatory. - My only mission is to ask questions. - Sure, like at the police station. I'm not a cop either. On the contrary. And what do you want to hear? To begin with, tell me, why do you always need violence? - I have to defend myself, right? - Defend yourself? From whom? From everything. From everyone. If I don't beat them, they beat me. Is it because you don't have a family? At home, I always had everything I needed. My old man does all right. He runs a fishmonger's shop, but I don't like the smell of fish. My parents are gypsies and I can't be changed that easily. And why should I change? The gypsy thing isn't for me, but I don't care about the non-gypsies just like they don't care about me. It's not my world, their laws aren't mine, and none of their stuff is for me. For the non-gypsies, all I'm good for is stealing chickens or performing at a flamenco club. Since I don't like singing or dancing, I know how to steal hens. Of course, there are no hens in Madrid, so I learned to make a living in a different way. And drugs. What do you think about drugs? I'm really into them. When I'm totally high... You get me or not? When I'm so wasted I can't see, that's when I feel like God. I don't give a fuck. And when I party, I go all out. You wouldn't believe it when I start tripping! I don't need anything to hallucinate. I start to kick things around in my head and I hallucinate like crazy. Describe these hallucinations. Can you explain them? Well I imagine myself in a green field, and I pull out my dick and start fucking the ground. Then, instead of trees, my children pop out, all of them just like me. And they love me, they love me, and they're delighted with me, because I'm the strongest, the smartest, and I'm really good. What does good mean to you? I mean, I'm good but not dumb. I don't have to hurt anyone, because no one is hurting me. - So, do I keep telling you my deal or not? - Go on, go on. Then I and my kids jump into the sea and go for a swim. In the sea? Didn't you say you were in the country? Look, I don't know much about that stuff. I never left Madrid, but I guess if there's country, there's a sea near, right? Right. Go on, go on. Like I said, we jump into the sea and start to swim. Until we reach an island full of hotties, all of them totally naked. Then we fuck them all. I mean, we fuck them and they fuck us. - Because these girls are hot for us. - And what else happens? And then more kids are born. A lot more. So, together we make the whole world again. This hallucination, to give it a name, would have delighted a journalist who was here this morning. He wanted to ask you some questions. He's writing a report on juvenile delinquency for a magazine. And there are a lot of naked girls in this magazine? - Not exactly. - Once they wanted to hire me for a fag magazine to show off my dick, but the pay was shit. - So no way. - I doubt you'd have to show anything here. We'll see if the judge authorizes the interview. That's why, Mr. Oteiza, I can't authorize an interview with that boy. Last week another journalist came and I told him the same thing. Excuse me, Judge, but I only want to talk to him, not interview him. Yes, yes, but if I authorize you, I'd have to authorize the others as well. If that boy starts talking to reporters, he's going to think he's someone important. He already is. A lot has been published about him. That's why I think that what Jaro can tell me in a story that much more comprehensive about juvenile detention facilities can't do any harm. It's not possible. So don't insist. Jaro is a kid with a strong personality. How would I describe him? He has charisma. - Charisma? - Yes. If that boy had gone into politics, he would have gone far. He has the makings of a leader. You should see him. When he talks, he has a kind of magnetism. - He has like a special force. - It's been of little use to him. Fourteen, fifteen, sixteen years old and they're already sentenced. In a sense, they were asking for it. Do you really believe they were asking for it? Well, I know they aren't the only ones to blame. I'm a judge, so understand that I merely apply the law. Honestly, don't you think they are using all this wave of delinquency? Using? In what sense? Using, manipulating, exaggerating, to be able to intimidate citizens. The worst part is everyone is doing it on both sides of the political spectrum. What do you mean? An old Spanish saying, Your Honor. Fear keeps the garden better than the gardener. Some people think that if there were no crime or terrorism, there would be no lack of people to invent them. I just escaped from the reformatory. Can I come in? Jaro! The owners of the villa won't be back until September. You're sure there's no guard? - They told me there wasn't. - Well, we're doing it tonight. We'll have to steal a car to get there. No way, man! 4 motorcycles are better. That way, if something happens, we can each take off on our own. - Hey, come with me. - Where? - Up there. - Wait, we're going to smoke a joint. This guy wants you to smoke his big fat cigar. Come with me. - He's gonna fuck her silly. - Yeah. - It won't give? - Motherfucker! It won't budge an inch! Goddammit! No fucking way. I bet the upper ones are easier. And it's easy to climb. Give me a hand. Hand me the crowbar. It's easy as hell up here, dudes. Freeze, Civil Guards! - The cops! Let's go! - Freeze! Freeze! We have to get Chus out of there. But... Come on. Hang on tight now. He's still bleeding a lot. We should call a doctor. - No, no way. - What do you mean no? - If they don't fix you, you'll die. - And what can we do? The first thing is not to be as freaked out as you. - I bet they killed Chus for sure. - Will you shut up, asshole? We can't do anything for Chus now. We have to help this guy. - Yes, but we have to fix him now. - We'll take him to the clinic. - And how do we explain it? - We'll invent some bullshit. Come on, I'll call a cab and we'll all go. No! No, not her. Not her! Leave it to us. I want to go with you. You need to stay. If something happens, it'll be better for you to be on the outside. What the fuck's going on? Can't you help him now? Calm down. We have a lot of emergencies tonight. But he's in bad shape. He needs to be seen right away. He's losing a lot of blood. You look a little hard up to me, huh? How do you feel, Jaro? How long have I been here? You've been unconscious for three days. Chus is dead, isn't he? - The doctor says you'll be better soon. - He's dead, isn't he? What did they do to me? They operated on you. For what? - Nothing important - What did they do to me? Jaro... Don't be afraid. The doctor said he had to remove a testicle. And what's that? Down here. So I'll never be a man again. What are you talking about? I know lots of men with just one testicle, and they function perfectly well. Seriously Jaro, I swear. They function perfectly well. Now if they'd cut off something else, of course... Don't lie to me. You know I'll never be a man again. Jaro, my God, if they'd cut it all off, for sure, but you're going to be fine. They castrated me. They killed Chus and castrated me. Motherfuckers, sons of bitches, bastards, faggots, rats! Fuck all of them. I'm going to kill them. I'm going to kill... Bastards. I'll kill... Ma'am, it's time to go. Visiting hours are over. Are you deaf? It's time to go! Sorry to bother you, you're Mercedes Sánchez, right? Yes, what do you want? I'd like to speak to you a moment. Don't worry, I'm not a cop. I'm a reporter. This might not be the best time to talk. - What do you want to talk about? - About Jaro. - About Jaro? - Don't worry. You can trust me. You see, I've been working on a story on juvenile delinquency for a long time. I've been trying to interview Jaro for months and still haven't been able to. Well, you'll have to wait until he escapes from the reformatory for the 29th time. No, this time they're not taking him to juvie. - What do you mean? Where is he going? - To the Zamora prison. That's where they're taking all the boys who are still minors but are considered to be too dangerous. - Do you have any cigarettes? - I'm all out. I'm getting a package from my folks tomorrow and we'll have all we need. This can't be happening. We've been here a month already and we need to get out, any way we can. This isn't the reformatory. It's not that easy. If we kick the idea around in our heads, we'll come up with something. That's for sure. You know what I say? I'm not going to escape. I prefer to stay. I mean it, guys, really. I've had enough of running all my fucking life. Besides, I'm already 16 years old. I don't want to end up in Carabanchel getting fucked up the ass by old guys. So back to selling fish with your old man, right? Well yeah. On second thought, there are worse smelling things. And how did you find out? We reporters find out everything. Well, almost everything. - But are you sure? - Completely. They escaped early this morning. - If he's caught, what'll they do to him? - I don't know. You shouldn't worry too much. He's still a juvenile. Although he may have problems. The newspapers have been talking about him a lot lately. And why do you want to talk to Jaro? What do you think he can tell you? I don't know, a lot of things. Look. I think that when a normal, working class citizen walks down the street and runs into a 15-year-old boy who instead of saying good evening, pulls a knife on him, something very serious is going on. It just doesn't make sense. I'm sure that Jaro can tell me things that aren't even in the police reports or the newspaper headlines. That's why I want to talk to him. Do you understand now? Jaro. Jaro! - What do you know about Toñi? - Dear God! That's exactly what we need to talk about. Did something happen to her? Yes, it did. I don't know if it's good or bad. What happened is that you knocked her up. - Knocked up? - Not a problem. A friend of mine gave me an address where Toñi can be taken care of. What are you talking about? - I mean if she wants an abortion. - Are you nuts? An abortion? Don't tell me you want to have a kid now. Sure I do. I already thought about it in jail. It pisses me off that people think I was castrated. Plus, I'm really fucking into having one. But what if she doesn't want to? Well I do. Is that guy crazy? It's his fault my brother Chus was killed! - I don't want to know anything about him. - Jaro is very sorry about your brother. They almost killed him too. But nobody was to blame for that. Anyway, it was clear they'd wind up this way. But I'm determined that Jaro won't have to keep doing those things. Well good for you. Not me. I like him, but not enough to hook up with him. I don't want to be a mother now. I can't, you understand? You wouldn't have to worry about anything. I make decent money and I have some savings. Why don't you come live with Jaro at my place? You won't be lacking anything. But why are you doing this? Weren't you with him? I've been with many. But I love Jam and I'm willing to give him everything he needs. And now he needs you and the child you're carrying. - But... - Besides, an abortion isn't so easy. The clinic I told you about is very unsafe and London is very expensive. You don't want to bleed out in a sleazy room somewhere? Do you? So what, dude? - Did you decide or not? - It's okay by me. Don't worry, man You've known us for a long time. You know we're legit. Dude, we're going to do some big fat lines, you know? The thing is, you're more famous than El Lute. Sure, man. But we already went over that. We need to forget about what we did in the past. Right Jaro? We have to plan something big. A humongous heist with tons of money. You're in charge, Jaro. Whatever you say is cool. After this, you should be in the movies. Did you see what the papers are saying about you? You seen this? Jaro and his gang. Kids who spr... spread... terror... in Madrid. Fucking A, dude. You're the best! What do you know about my mother? Sorry, I totally forgot. She works every night in Plaza del Carmen. What's up with you? This stuff about your mother is a pain in the ass. - Shut up. - Me shut up? Why should I shut up? Why should I shut up? I spend hours here bored, expecting a kid I didn't want. And on top of that I have to shut up!? - Come on, my child. - Don't call me a child. Both of you bore me to death, you know that? I'm going to wind up getting paranoid. And what about you? Huh? Since you escaped from jail you don't do anything. You look stoned, waiting for me to give birth and sponging off this one. Just a moment. "This one" has a name. And I give my money to anyone I want. And you're ungrateful, because I also give you everything you need. Lady, cut the crap! Leave me alone! What do you think? Don't listen to her. That's how all women get when they're pregnant. - Hysterical, because they're insecure. - Yeah. - What day do you think is best? - Tomorrow is fine. Great, man. Why wait? And the piece, did you get one already? We got two, dude, we got two. A pistol and a shotgun. Awesome. You know the deal. You, Pastilla, wait outside with the car running. The Kid, Butano, and I will go in. Let me do the talking. It'll all be over in 10 minutes. Taking the freeway, we'll be in Madrid in no time at all. - Let's go? - Come on! Having a good time? - And Toñi? - She left, she had to go to the doctor. Damn it! I was supposed to go with her. I can't seem to remember anything lately. Look. They're still too big now, but they'll last him until he's a year old. When he's born, you'll see. Her feet will be this small. So cute. Oh, another thing, before I forget. I saw that reporter who wants to interview you at all costs. - We're meeting him tomorrow at 12. - Noon or midnight? 12 noon. - I don't know if I can make it. - Well, you have to. That guy's been after you for a long time. I like him. You'll like him too. Yeah I'd like to meet him. But... But What? I have a job. What job? You know. One of my things. Didn't we agree that there wouldn't be any more of those things? Yes, but the more I think of my life, the more I think I was only born to do this. Think about it, Jaro. Think about it and be careful. Besides, you seem so sad lately. What's the matter? Is it Toñi? She doesn't love me. Come on, Toñi loves you. Look, I know about these things. Toñi loves you very much. The thing is that you are both kids and love is a very complicated thing. It's like when they give you a toy when you're a child. You immediately go and break it to see what's inside. And before you know it, you've already smashed it to pieces. Love is very complicated. You're both kids and that's all there is. Yeah, but after my kid is born, she won't be around much longer. And what am I going to do with a kid and the miserable life I have? Don't worry, I'll take care of the kid. And of you too. Because I do love you. I love you very much. I really do. I love you. I love you more than anyone else. You're so serious. Let's see a smile. That's the way I like you. What time does the bank open? At 9 o'clock. It's almost time. Come on, let's see if you can find some decent music. According to reports, the attack occurred around 7:15 this morning. Police forces were immediately deployed as well as the Civil Guard at all exits and junctions of Interstate One along the section of highway - between kilometer 10 and 25... - Ostia! It seems that the terrorist group has been located in this area. An eyewitness to the attack has described the terrorists as four individuals, possibly youths, with their faces covered by ski masks and armed with machine guns. One of them was wearing a yellow raincoat. The Civil Guard is carrying out - a thorough sweep of the highway. - Well that screws up our plans. - What do we do now, Jaro? - All vehicles... - What can we do? - ...heading in this direction, and all drivers, as well as their passengers, will be required to show their ID cards and must also show the documentation for their cars. - They are also carrying out a... - The cops, dude! They suspect that the 4 terrorists who formed the commando fired the shots from a stolen vehicle that was found abandoned about 200 yards away. Careful, dudes, there's another checkpoint down the road! - We're fucking trapped! - What are you talking about? What's your deal? Are you tripping? We can't continue or go back. What do you say, Butano? It looks pretty bad. We gotta get out of here. - Should we take the guns? - No! Okay, yeah, let's go! Look! That way, come on! Yes? Yes. Just a second. At your service. It's a stolen car, captain, they hot-wired it. - Well, that this doesn't help us much. - No. Damn it! Are you out of your fucking mind? He's already more than an hour late. Could something have happened to him? No, I don't think so. The city's full of checkpoints today, but I doubt that anything happened to him. - Plus Jaro knows how to defend himself. - But he's just a kid. Of course he's a kid. You warn him to be careful, but sometimes you get around the biggest obstacles only fall for the stupidest or most obvious scenario. Maybe next time. I'm sorry, but I can't wait any longer. I have to go. - Let's hope for better luck next time. - I hope so. - Good bye. - Good bye. An eyewitness to the attack has described the terrorists as four individuals, possibly youths, with their faces covered by ski masks and armed with machine guns. One of them was wearing a yellow raincoat. Don't move! Drop your weapons and hands in the air! Hurry up, drop your weapons and hands against the wall. That's it. Come on! Get them up! Get your hands up! Freeze. What the hell are you doing? Who are you? - What are you doing here? - We were running from the cops! We were running from the cops! What's up with you, dude? You're tripping again, aren't you? Yes, can't I just trip or what? You could have told me before dropping LSD. - Yeah. - So? Are you going to go see your mother? - Hello, mother. - Jarocho. How are you, Mom? What are you doing here? The police keep nagging me. - They want to know where you are! - I can imagine. But all of a sudden I really wanted to see you. Well... I wanted to see you too, Jarocho. But look, these papers talk about you. I got them from Truena, that one over there. Truena! Truena! - Why are you calling her? - Silly, she can't wait to meet you. What is it? Who's this little guy? Say what, don't you recognize him? - He's my son. - Shit, the famous Jaro! Oh, the things I've read about you. Tomasa, Petra, Angela, Cebollada, come here! Don't do this to me! - Come on, Truena, don't make a fuss! - It's Jaro! What's going on here? What's up? - It's Jaro! - It's her son! It's Jaro! It's Jaro in person! It's Jaro! It's really him! He's such a doll. It's Jaro, dudes. - Are you sure? - Yeah, I saw him the other day in the news. That guy's Jaro, isn't he? He's so handsome! A little room. What is this? Cut the crap right now or there's going to be a round-up. And who is this kid? Don't you remember him? He's my Jarocho. Fucking hell! And what are you after around here? - Come on, Sebas, he came to see me! - To cause another boarding house mess? Kid, you've got all the cops on your tail. Don't make any more trouble for your mother. The only one making trouble for my mother is you, who turned her into a whore. Your mother was already a whore long before you were born. And if you don't believe me, ask your bastard father to tell you. Jarocho! They'll kill each other! He's got nothing. Come on, Jaro, come on, come on! Careful! What a shame. He's all yours, Sebas! All yours! Careful, Sebas! The cops! The cops! Let's go, get out of here! The police. Let's go! Hurry up! Sebas! Honey. What did he do to you? Honey. Honey. Bitch! Are you done? You've been reading that paper for three days. - Give me some hash to make a joint. - I don't have any. Plus you know it makes you sick. Here we go again. - You sound like the old lady. - Are you insane? You're about to give birth and still want to smoke. - Get off my case! - If I want to get high, it's my problem. - And for our son, too! Yeah, of course. Our son. That's funny. - What's funny? - I don't know. This whole mess. It all started like a trip, and it still is one. And now, all of a sudden, a kid. We're going to have a kid, and what the hell will we give him? Nothing. He'll be a poor soul like you and me. I'll do all I can so our son isn't a poor soul. And what can you do? What have you done since you got out of jail? The famous Jaro, sponging off a pain in the ass hag for months! Even a heist that was easy to pull off turned out all wrong. Get off my case! - What are you talking about? - Get off, don't touch me! - Sorry. - What are you looking at? What are you waiting for to make something of yourself? - What's the matter? - Nothing, I'm leaving! Got it? I'm fucking sick and tired and I'm leaving! Jaro! Jaro! THE END
