You know the poem that was on the exam in March. Yeah. "I saw my dear in my dream and his beautiful face has gotten old." Remember the theme of the poem was? Isn't this a poem written for one's lover? I said that's a wrong answer. I said the "dear" here refers to the King. Oh right, the King. Faithfulness, loyalty. But does it make any sense? "I would rather die and become a setting moon." "I will then shine where my dear is." Doesn't it sound weird for something you would say to the King? It does. It really does. Right? I think it's the downside of Confucianism. This country is so crazy about Confucianism that they interpret love as loyalty. This is still corrupting this society. But Ms. KIM. If the King was a person like you, I would have written a poem like this too. I think someone like you should be the President. Wait. What? What is it? Condom. I didn't want to do it, so I didn't buy it. I really wanted to hold it in this time. Okay. It's not safe, so let's not do it. Let's just lie like this. Right. Of course it's not safe, of course… I like this too. Right. I like it too. More Than Family 5 months later Let's go to the hospital tomorrow. It's okay. I won't be able to get an abortion anyway. It's already been five months. We thought you would suggest an abortion, so... I'm so sorry! Why do you have to be so dramatic? So what's your plan? Who will raise the baby? What about your college? Graduation? Work? What's your plan? I knew you would be concerned, so I prepared something. KIM To-il's 5-Year Plan Marriage and Studies, How to Catch Two Birds? Why did you choose this way? In order to shorten the time we stress each other out, I believe this is the best way. You bit our hands that fed you, and didn't look before you leap. I just met a match made in heaven, and a bold attempt is a half success. Your argument doesn't hold water, I'm dumbfounded. You know you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. I knew you would cause big trouble one day, but this is just surreal. And he's even underage. I failed a year. I'm not underage. Out of the flying pan into the fire. What's so bad about failing a year? Both of you have so much social prejudice. Why did you fail a year, Ho-hun? I went to Saudi Arabia for of my father's business... You're over 20. When will you learn to walk before you run? Why are you making a mountain out of an anthill? - Ho-hun, she talked you into it, right? - Yes. No, I mean... You must see the forest, not only the trees. You have to sacrifice so many things. So what have you sacrificed? How did she talk you into this? Because… To-il is a genius. Well, I guess it's true. I guess you did sacrifice a lot for me. What? You were having a good life, but then suddenly I came. That's not what I meant... If you don't like it so much, I will leave. I will leave! Hey, why are you yelling? You know that you did something wrong, don't you? Why are you throwing stones from your glass house? Did you expect our blessings in this situation? If I was your real daughter, you would've given me your blessings. What on earth is wrong with you? To-il! I'm sorry for causing trouble. To-il! Still, it would have been better if it happened after the CSAT exam. You should have held it in. Could you hold it in when you were his age? No. How could I? I can't even now. I can't hold it in. - Father, Mother. - No way. Yes? You seem too cool with it. Then should we cry about it? We are surprised too. But I'm sure you and Ms. KIM talked it through over the night. - Am I right? - Yes, Ma'am. I'm sure there was a good reason for it. It's indeed a happy occasion, but you seem genuinely happy about it. And it makes me extremely happy too. Oh, right. - Oh, my. - What is it? - Do you remember that? - What? When the chief monk named Ho-hun, he said, "He would achieve early." So that meant he would make a family early. It's so nice to have you in our family, Ms. KIM. By the way, I'm so sorry that your parents are upset about this. - Right. - The wedding should be happy. Maybe we are so cool about this because we have a son. But I'm sure they would be happy once the baby is born. - They will adore the baby so much. - Of course. There's something you can't resist about your own flesh and blood. For sure. In the end, your dad will hold your hand and walk you down the aisle. - I just realized you can't do that. - Can't what? Holding a hand and walking down the aisle. Oh, right. I can't do that because I don't have a daughter. I have always wanted to do that. I think she should stay here until her parents aren't mad anymore. - We are totally fine with it. - Sure. - To-il. - Yes? Right? No. I have somewhere to go. What? What is it this time? Daegu Office of Education: Find My Teacher Goodness. Did you get a house already? Why are you home so early? I left work early. Would you be able to focus in class if you were me? Where are you going? Hey. I thought about it, and I just don't get it. Why now? Mom. Do you think I didn't think it through before I decided to give birth? So why do you have to do this? Please. Can't you just trust me and think there was a good reason for it. Aren't you scared to have a daughter like you? Why would I? That's why I'm giving birth to this baby. Please realize that you are not that smart. What will you say to your dad? You take care of it. That's how we always do it. I'll send you the presentation file, so take a look. You know, I don't doubt your wisdom. But do you have to find him now? Your biological father. You said you didn't even know his name. Well, I know his family name is CHOI. Do you know anything else other than that? He's a technology and home economics teacher. On Daegu Office of Education website, I found a few teachers who have Choi as their family names. He should be one of them. Is it a good thing to find him? You have a normal family, so you don't get it. I mean, what if you end up getting hurt while looking for him? Why would I get hurt? He can't be worse than my parents now. And at this point, it's not strange that one of us looks for the other. Don't forget to take them. Folic acid, iron, vitamin, fiber, omega Right. If they don't have acorn jelly there, I will send you some. Don't worry. I will be back in a week. Seoul to Daegu Bus ticket Mom, when are we arriving? Sir, how long does it take from Daegu to Seoul? How long does it take from Chungcheong Province to Seoul? Why doesn't he answer? - To-il. - Yes? You can stop calling him "Sir". Just call him Dad. - Grandpa! Grandma! - You idiot! - Come here! - Please calm down! - Come here already! - Please listen to me! I'm pregnant. - Get her! - Come here! You shouldn't touch me, I'm pregnant! - Get her! - Where on earth were you? - Grandma! Please stop him! - Get her! What kind of family is this? First, your mother's divorce and second marriage. Now, this? This is all my fault. It's all because I didn't visit my ancestors' graves often. After all those ancestral rites? Our ancestors need to be more generous. You... Your grandfather is from the Bae clan of Dalseong. He's the 22nd descendant of the Pan-seo-gong branch. This is so embarrassing I can't see our neighbors' faces. What's wrong with you and your mother? That's a good question. - What's wrong with us? - You punk! This is all my fault. It's my fault. How did Seon-myeong not know about it when her stomach is so big? Has she gone blind? What's the world coming to. She hasn't even gotten married yet. How could her mother not know what her daughter is up to? How could she get pregnant before getting married? This country must be near its doom. Rice with acorn jelly I looked through all the photo albums yesterday, and I couldn't find any pictures of my dad. They must've thrown them away. Then you will have to find him without knowing his face. Can't you remember his face at all? Not even his impression? It's very vague. But I think I'll recognize him right away when I see him. By the way To-il, I have been thinking. You might not like this, but… - I think it will be all right... - What's wrong? How about hiring a private investigator? Hello? To-il? Sorry, you must be mad. I knew you might be but I just wanted.. To-il? Hello? Why don't you answer? I said don't worry. Please call me. OK. CHOI Kyeong-hwan, (Seonwoo Girls' High School) Excuse me, Sir. Yes? I... It's me. I graduated here two years ago. - Right. - How have you been? I have been good. By the way, how's your daughter? My daughter? I'm not married yet. Oh… I have been working my butt off for months to collect the figures! It's a limited edition, so you can't buy it anymore. What's wrong with your dad? I don't know! I hate that old man! You know that's domestic violence, right? It's your private property. An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. Should I break his fishing rod? Right. He has a drone. We have a huge drone at home. Hey. Hey! Where did you get this CD player? I got it for free from a second-hand market. No, you didn't. Who gives away such a clean one? Will you keep lying? I know you stole your dad's money. I said I didn't. He's the one who lost it, so stop bugging me! You know we're visiting your aunt today. She wants to see you. I'm not going! She wants to see me? Like she has seen me much. KIM To-il! Will you keep being rude to your dad like that? Did you hear anything from To-il? She went to Daegu. Why Daegu, all of a sudden? How would I know? Did she run away because she didn't want to be with me? Don't do it. You were going to call her, weren't you? No, I wasn't. Don't you ever call her first. Not this time. I won't. I seriously won't this time. I won't be that easy this time. I was going to search something on the internet. What day is it today? To-il day? - Don't. - I won't. Daegu is very hot. Seo-mun Market How can I help you? I'm just looking. Is it so fascinating that I'm pregnant? Would you like to take a picture? Aren't you To-il? Excuse me? You are. You are CHOI To-il! Bok-dong Fritters - Are you Bok-nam? - Yes, I am! - Hey! - Hey! I had a crush on that guy. - You had a serious crush on him. - I know. This takes me back. By the way, how did you know that it's me? I'm fascinated. That you use the Seoul dialect is more fascinating to me. By the way, why did you suddenly move away like that? My mom married another man. I guess she didn't want to live here because all the people here knew about it. I guess. Goodness. It would have been horrible indeed. This neighborhood is really small. If she stayed here, the entire neighborhood would have fussed about it. It's good that you moved to Seoul. Your friends don't know about your family, right? The rumor that Ja-hyeon's parents were divorced was true. Divorce? Goodness. There are actually quite many kids whose parents are divorced. That's dope. If my parents get a divorce, I will probably kill myself. I can't even imagine it. Seriously. It's interesting that you want to marry so early. Me? Ho-hun and I will never end up like my mom and dad. How do you know that? Still, why do you have to have a baby already? Think outside the box. Having a baby early might be better in the end. You're crazy! I can't believe you're such a naive person. Maybe. Maybe I'm such a naive person… However, not many men appreciate my true charm. Most men are too petty to stand that I'm so smart. But he admires me. All he cares about is me. I'm smart and Ho-hun cares about me. Isn't that more than enough? So I'm confident. Do you have anything you want to say to me? No, I don't. I got a package yesterday. It was an iPad. So-hee, try this fritter. It looks good. Don't change the subject and answer me! Try it. It looks tasty. Do you feel like eating now? Did you forget that you pocketed the money for her academy? You're embarrassing me. Could you keep it down? Goodness. - You're one persistent woman. - My goodness. Doesn't it look amazing? By the way, if she's been pregnant for five months now, she should have her gum, limbs, and the whole body swollen, right? Don't even get me started on that. I could make it through because of his prenatal massage. That almost killed me. Indeed, you did have a hard time for 3 months. And I had a hard time for 10 months. Right. I need pepper. - JANG Ho-hun. - Yes. What did Ms. KIM say was the hardest? What do her parents say? I haven't met them since. What? Don't you have responsibility? Goodness. Imagine how frustrated her parents would be to see you. You're still a high school student and have no skills. Plus, you don't even work hard. Maybe you should get like a license or something. Do you know what her parents like? - What subjects do they teach? - Tell us. We love you, JANG Ho-hun. Try harder. Try harder. Let's eat. Let's eat. Eat up. Honey, try it. It's really good. Time for the supplements I don't know this. (As you sow, so shall you reap) Don't you know it? It's the easiest one. If you're a college student, you should know this. How could you not know this if you know all the other... Hello. Hello. How may I help you? Don't you recognize me? You just showed up like that. How am I supposed to know? Think about it. Don't I ring any bells? You do look familiar. Don't I look like someone? You look like someone? Who could that be? Who... You're right. You do look like someone. Who? Are you... Is this that wench? Where did you come from? You even call her to school? Are you out of your mind? What about yourself? What are you doing in school... Just shut it, will you? We will end this today. So, what is that you want? You're so young to be... Well, I'm... What? - You even got her pregnant? - Pregnant…? No, that's not it. What on earth are you saying? I just met her. - Who the hell are you? - Stop the bullshit. Don't you think of bullshitting me. Did you just hit my head? You just crossed the line. You even got her pregnant? - Hey, look at that. - Answer me! Did you get her pregnant? - Are you out of your mind? - What? Get out! - How could you... - Excuse me. - Hey! - How dare you... What's their problem? You ran away because you didn't want to see me? Just kidding. You ran away because you didn't want to see me? Hey, I heard you were in Daegu. You ran away because you didn't want to see me? That's not true. You have a lot to do for the marriage. You should come back and deal with things one by one. And... I think I was too harsh on you last time. I didn't have to be like that in front of your boyfriend. You don't have to worry about it. Anyway, come back so we can talk about the wedding and stuff. Don't forget to eat the acorn jelly. We should come with Dad too. Come on. Did you sit tight? Hold the rope tight so you don't fall again. Come on. You should sit too. - To-il. - Yes? Dad won't come here with us. Have you ever gone somewhere with your dad? From now on, we will not live with your dad again. What does that mean? I'm going first. Come on! That's cheating! 5-year-plan Timeline Baby caring plan during college years Before earning money, 4 years Plans to get a house She blabs this nonsense diligently. If she had discussed it with us, I would have stopped her. In the end, we would have let her do what she wanted. This one is really over the top. Well, but you know her character. Now I think of it, I was like that to her too. You had no choice back then. It's impossible that you were worse than To-il now. It doesn't comfort you at all, does it? No. Let's not think about it. Gosh, it will be funny if an unrealistic drama is on when I turn on the TV now. I won't be able to get an abortion. It's been five months. I failed a year. I'm not underage. Ho-hun, you're my son. Do you think… your parents will be happy about our marriage eventually? My parents? Even if they don't like it, what can they do about it? Why? Actually, when I went to your place earlier, you and your father were using hard Chinese idioms. I didn't... I didn't understand a thing. What? Why do you worry about that? Don't be ridiculous. I thought you guys were using code words or something. Should I go to a Buddhist temple and learn idioms from a monk? Hey, you don't even study for the college entrance exam. But still... Okay. By the way, if the guy you're seeing tomorrow is the last one, maybe he's the one. What do you want to do when you meet him? I don't know. Now I'm here, I'm even more confused. Aren't you tired of it? How can you eat acorn jelly every day? - Are you a squirrel? - You little... Go and do your homework. I don't have any homework. I go to a ballet school, so I don't get any homework. Do you want to see? Don't. I hate ballet. Don't do it. I said don't do it. Why don't you show it to your mom? I don't have a mom. You don't? It's okay. What about dad? I have a dad. Then you might get a mother later. CHOI Kyeong-hun I put so much effort into every stitch. - You broke her heart. - Please be more generous. Ji-yeon, let me see yours. It took so long. Goodness. Look at the mess. - Come on, Sir. - Can't you see it? It has my heart in it. Heart, my foot. No one would be able to make it this bad. Sir, I'm only a human. I can't be perfect at everything. - Knock it off. - Isn't it nice? Do it again and bring the new one. - Yes, Sir. - Okay? - Yes, Sir. - Yes, Sir. Good. You can go now. Get out of my sight. Mr. CHOI must be a perfectionist. What are you saying? Don't be so uptight. - Here. - Thank you. I'm so sorry. I must be getting dementia already. I can't remember you. I understand that you don't remember me right away. I usually remember the students that listened to me well. How weird. Why? Do I smell like an old single man? No way. Don't be like that. Do you still live by yourself? What about your family? It's been a while since I started living alone. I feel like you had a daughter. Am I right? I had one, but I haven't seen her in a while. It's been over 10 years now. Why did you get married so early? Well, I just thought it was the thing to do. As long as your husband is a decent dude, it's okay. How about yourself? Me? Can't you see it? I'm the pinnacle of decency. Do you not miss your daughter? Of course, I miss her. It's me. It's me, To-il. Can't you recognize me? What an odd name. Who gave you the name? My daughter's name was Su-yeong. She drowned when she was seven. Isn't it funny? "Su-yeong" means swimming. None of my students used the Seoul dialect. I don't know what your story is, but I'm sorry. No, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. It's okay. JANG Ho-hun Hey, you really made it. What about the store? I closed it. I asked Mom to watch the store, but she said she's busy with my brother Bok-dong's college admission. You're the owner of the store. Why do you need her permission? I'm not the owner. The store is not mine. Of course, it's yours. You shouldn't work for free because it's your family business. Why don't you put your name in the name of the store? This is upsetting. What's there to be upset about? But... You're right. You're right. I'm the owner. Yes, you're the owner. - Should I change the name? - Do it. - "Bok-nam Fritters"? - That sounds perfect. - Call a sign company. - "Bok-nam Fritters"? Order a sign with even your face on it. It's weird to see you like this. Back then, we were both just kids. But now you live in Seoul and I'm still in Daegu. You're a college student and I'm still working in the fritter store. You're pregnant and I'm... When will I ever get married? I didn't get married yet either. This is supposed to be weirder. I guess you're right. I admire you. Why? You do everything you want to do. Don't you have fear? I do a lot of dumb things too. Why do you say that? What dumb things? It's a long story. And of course I have fear too. I get scared too. But... my curiosity is bigger than my fear. How much is it for two people? 15,000 won for a 2-seater and 18,000 won for a 4-seater. Let's put on the vests. To-il, put the vest on. You don't want to go to the ballet class and to ride the duck boat? Who is that man, by the way? He's a teacher at my school. What does he teach? Chinese characters. CHOI To-il To-il, you can write Chinese characters well. Do you know how to read them? No, I don't. Would you like to teach me how? "To" for Saturday, and "il" for Sunday. What does it mean? It's just my name. Because I was born between Saturday and Sunday. Who gave you that name? Dad. That's cool. Let's go ride the duck boat. Okay. Let's go. But why is he coming too? You said you wanted to try riding the big duck. The big duck is a four-seater, so we can't ride it alone. Let me talk to her. You see, when the big duck farts, it can catch up with all the small ducks. It's really fast. Shall we? Will you pedal harder? I told you this is hard! - I can't pedal hard because I'm pregnant. - Then why did you want to ride this? Keep pedaling. Don't make me do things like this! Hey, we need to go that way. What's his family name? JANG. From which JANG clan? I don't know things like that. You always get so hung up on the family stuff. If family stuff is so not important, why do you look for your biological father? How did you know it? I saw you took out all the photo albums. Did you throw away all the photos of him? Do you remember your father? I didn't throw any photos. There have never been any photos. So I didn't get a chance to take pictures with Dad. I'm humiliated to see the neighbors and feel ashamed to face our ancestors, but as long as you and your mom are happy, it's okay. I was just curious. I wanted to know whom I took after to have become like this. Take after whoever you want to take after. By the way, why are there only my photos? Why are there no photos of Mom? Because there was no one to take photos of her. She was busy taking your photos. - Enjoy. - Thank you. This will be the last day I come here. Why? I don't have anything to do here. I will see you later. But you said today is your last day. I didn't mean it. It would be nice to see you again. I don't think I know your name. - What's your name? - CHOI Il-wol. "Il-wol"? You were born in January, right? No. Then why is your name "Il-wol"? Because I was born between Sunday and Monday. That's my place. Dad, are you there? Let me finish this first. Why are you home so early? Where's Aunt? Why did you come alone? Who is she? She's a pregnant woman who always comes to eat acorn jelly. Il-wol, wait here. Okay. You... Are you To-il? You're To-il, right? Why won't you answer? Wait there. - You... - Stop talking! I thought about what I should say when I meet you. My name is not CHOI To-il. My name is KIM To-il. My current dad is KIM, so mine is changed too. Ridiculous, right? KIM To-il, what a name, right? Do you know how old I am? Have you ever counted? You are not even curious, are you? All you want to know is just one thing, right? You were going to ask me why I came, right? You wonder why I came. Do I have to explain that? Hey, you're back. Yes. Good. Tell Ho-hun we would like to meet his parents. If possible, on the weekend. The phone is turned off. Please leave a message after the beep. Your call will be charged after the beep. I couldn't see him at home, so I thought he must be with you. I thought that's why he wasn't answering his phone. Then when is the last time you saw him? I was busy, so I haven't seen him since that day. That day? The day you visited our place? Does Ho-hun have a credit card from a different bank? Did you two have a fight? No, we didn't. We have been in touch until two days ago. Two days ago? Ho-hun would never do that on purpose. He may be a little slow, but he's very responsible. You know him. This idiot dropped his phone somewhere again. You don't have to worry at all. You shouldn't feel stressed because of this. We will contact the police and see what we can do. You should go home and take a good rest. Okay? I'm sure it's not a big deal. You know, it's Ho-hun. In times like this, don't use your imagination. Just don't think. That's what you should do. Okay? Don't think. Let's not think together. Let's zone out. Come on. Zone out. - Zone out. - Zone out. He didn't run away. Time for the supplements He would never do that. I'm just curious about this baby. Not the baby after this. Is it that stupid? Did they call the police? Why would they call the police? We need to find him anyway. Hey, where are you going? I don't want to see him caught by the police. I will find him. What are you talking about? Just wait. Let's go out and look for him. Do you remember Ho-hun's face? You saw him only once. Of course, I do. How could I forget that asshole's face? Honey. Are you okay? Yes. Ho-hun! I just... Wait! Oh, hi. Just leave it there. Is it cash on delivery? This is a nice place. Now explain what happened. First, I would like to say that I'm very confused and humiliated. I think you should explain what the two of you are up to. - What we are up to? - We are not up to anything. We are just decisive and have powerful drive. - You can't blame that. - Will you be quiet? But seriously, how did you find me? The note in your bag. I found the address on it. Did you look through it? You should say something too. - I mean... - Just like your mom. Your mom took the words from my mouth. I've been stabbed in the back. But now your tongue is boneless but it breaks my bones. I've been building the trust for 15 years. Like filling a bottomless vessel. I also feel great responsibility for this situation. But I don't want you to misunderstand my intention. If you're so innocent, you should have told us. She's right. Why do you always defend yourself after causing trouble? You're always like this. You could have told us first. And you'll run away again if things don't work out. - What's your problem? - What's your problem? I don't know! That's why I went there. Well done! Sometimes, you need to just push it through. That's life. Are you out of mind? What are you so proud of? She said she was just curious. Why do you scold her so much? I came because I was curious too. I just wanted to check how she lived. Who knew she would pop out then? You wanted to check, so you borrowed the delivery men's uniform? - I can explain... - I'm not interested. What's important is that we didn't intend this situation. You kept your pregnancy secret for five months. And you didn't intend this? Right. What's with your belly? Does it matter now? Right. Ho-hun. What? Folic acid, iron, vitamin, fiber, omega Not him. - He's not here. - Of course, he's not. I don't think he's here. I want to check the badminton court. Finding him here would've been a problem too. Will you marry a boy who hides in a comic book store? When I was going to protests, I used to hide in comic book stores. Will you think before you talk? Seen one, seen them all. Who on earth would marry this boy? Why do you jump to a conclusion? Don't cross the bridge till you come to it. Have you all had lunch yet? Can we have some instant noodles first? I'm hungry too. When your mother was pregnant with you, she only ate thistles. Shut up and eat. Wait. You don't eat cucumbers. Right. When you were young, you got nauseated by cucumber smell and threw up. It was so funny. Was she 10 when she started to like acorn jelly? It's interesting that she loves acorn jelly, but hates buckwheat jelly. Remember the buckwheat restaurant in Daegu? Do you want me to cook Aglio - Olio al dente tonight? I think I'm getting sick. A broken engagement is better than divorce. Why would you say that already? There must be a reason why you decided to marry him. What are the good things about him? First, he's cute. You can't see such a build anywhere. A treat for the eyes won't last long. Sometimes, seeing the handsome face calms you down. But if that's the only reason you're marrying the man, you will want to pull out his eyeballs just by looking at him. There must be more than just the cute face. He has no inferiority complex. He may be a little dumb, but he only loves me. And he's very muscular. I sometimes even think he got the muscles in exchange for his brain. And I think he cooks better than me. And... He's really considerate. Then he wouldn't have made this situation, don't you think? Some people have to be cut off for good. We all can get cold feet and get lost sometimes. He might soon get it together and show up again. You know they say people don't change. Nothing can be worse than raising a child alone. It will be better than raising a child and your husband. - There you go! - Nice! - Nice! - Hurry! - There you go! - Take this! - Excuse me. - Come on! Excuse me? - It's going that way. - Catch it. - Hurry! - Hurry over! Wait, wait. How can I help you? We haven't seen Ho-hun around lately. He doesn't say anything in the group chat either. He doesn't even read any messages. I see. Thank you. Wait up. You must be Ho-hun's wife. Right? You're our sister-in-law! Finally, we met. You're so beautiful. We always asked him when he would introduce you to us. Right. So what's going on? Did Ho-hun disappear? What do we do? He's a good boy. He wouldn't disappear. There must be a problem. Oh, my. You should have been careful. Hey, watch your mouth! I apologize. He's just kidding. Well, it's not something you can be careful about. - I'm sorry. - Apologize. It's okay. He played badminton with these losers? What a jerk. What did she just say? Hang on. Just a second. What did you just say? I think I just heard something wrong. Hey, you have got a temper, don't you? - What are you saying? - You sound like you could eat up Ho-hun. - Yes, I ate him up! So what? - Hey, hey! Wait, what? - Wow. - Where's your manner? - So? - This is embarrassing. - What's embarrassing? - Goodness. - Stop it. - I was right! Ho-hun ran away. - What are you saying? - Hey, Miss. Imagine you were him. Do you think you can live with a woman like you? Hey, watch your words. - Think about the baby. - You should watch what you say. He's right. What will the baby learn? Is this how you were taught at home? - What did you just say? - Wait! Hey, man. You go home and learn more, okay? - What? You... - My gosh. - Stop it. - How dare you bring that up? - What's going on? - I didn't want to yell at you! Goodness. You have no respect whatsoever, don't you? What's up? - What's going on? - Wait. - What's the matter. - Let's just go. What did you guys say? Today is full of fun events. What's with this delivery man? This is why our packages are late. Go back to your work. - Seoul punks really have got some guts. - Don't. Looks like all you have is your pie hole. Let me tear that off your face! - Hey! Get him! - Don't do this to strangers! - We just met them! - Let go of me! - How dare you! - Oh, come on! - You... - Please! - It's not your place to fuss about it. - Enough! - Fuss? - Yes! - What was that all of a sudden? - Mom. - Come here. - Enough. - Stop it. - What about yourself? You have done such a good job at parenting she came to find me. What did you just say? Are you not ashamed to say something like that? Hey. It's you who has nothing but a pie hole. How dare you act like a father now? Are you kidding me? I'm not here for my own sake. How touching. Why couldn't you be so sweet when we were together? You said being a father wasn't your thing! Honey, that's enough. Hey, tell me. Did your thing change now? When we were living together, you pocketed the kid's tuition! Goodness. This is embarrassing. Why are you bringing that up now? Is it embarrassing? Do you know what's really embarrassing? Stop it! This is why you don't want me to get married. It's because your marriages are all messed up! You caused all this. Are you happy now? If you had let us meet normally, it would have been fine. You didn't even recognize my face at first! - Well, that's... - So? Are you happy now because you found him? Why? Why did you find him? Are you happy now? You should have asked him to march with you at the wedding too. What? Did you go to Daegu because of that? No. That's not true at all. I thought meeting my real father would make a change. Who knew he would be such a weird person? What? What about me? Am I a fake father? Am I more distant to you than the guy you met after 15 years? - That's not what To-il meant... - Stop butting in! He's like the pot calls the kettle black. What do I lack than him? What more do I have to do to... You... How could you do that to your father? The pot calls… What? What is he saying? - Are they code words or what? - Stop it. Code words? What is it? We need to go to the temple. Temple? What temple? Is his family Buddhist? Are you okay? Are you all right? You walked too much. You're pregnant. I just need a break. I'll be fine. Take some rest here. We will go. We can't leave her alone here. I will stay with her. - Then I... - Then I... Please never let me see CHOI Hwan-gyu ever again. Please. Wish Rock Gosh, it doesn't move. Why did you come to a temple? Did you want to do things like this? After he heard dad and I using a lot of difficult idioms, he said he would go to a monk and learn Chinese characters. Is it true about my tuition? Why do you want to know? I hated ballet class anyway. That was good for me. That's not the reason you quit ballet school. It's because of your height. My height? Your father said learning ballet at a young age would keep you from growing. Which father are you talking about? Your current father. But we were living just the two of us then. I told him you hated ballet class. So I guess he didn't want you to do something you hated. I kept on making you go to the class anyway, and one day, he brought a clipping from a newspaper and showed it to me. It said learning ballet at a young age kept you from growing. A missing person, JANG Ho-hun, built His name is JANG Ho-hun. His name is JANG Ho-hun. We are looking for JANG Ho-hun. Here you are. I'm sorry. It's okay. - Don't do it. - Why? He's not a criminal. This is odd. What do you mean by odd? What matters is we find him quickly. To-il hates these kinds of things. When we find him, she will appreciate it. You don't know anything about her. Don't you feel ashamed that you don't know? Go. Where? We will take care of this. So just go. For the last 15 years, I tried my best. I don't know what To-il thought you could offer that I can't, but I did some father stuff. That's right. I did. And you didn't do anything, Mr. Choi. Just go. To-il came to me and only yelled at me. She didn't come to me because you lack in any way. At first, I couldn't understand her, but I think she's cool. She did the thing I couldn't do because I'm scared and lazy. But To-il wouldn't have grown into that by herself. You and Seon-myeong raised her like that. You three hang out together. I will stay here. I don't want to waste the flyers, so I will put the rest of them. What's the point of just putting them? I knew there were some reason why To-il is so reckless. The environment must have played a big role in that. One's natural characteristic can hardly be changed by education. Excuse me, Sir. We're looking for JANG Ho-hun. ㄹ Do you know Ho-hun? I see him from time to time. Do you know where he is now? When is the last time you've seen him? I cannot dare to see the order of the fate. That means he doesn't know, right? Mom. Why did you divorce him? Was it so hard to live with him? You know you sometimes ask obvious things. Just like your father. Which father? I wasn't unhappy because I had a divorce. I had a divorce because I was unhappy. What are you doing? You might collapse. Goodness. Let me do it. That won't do anything. Let me see. Come on. Let's pull together. - One, two, three. - One, two, three. - Gosh, I thought it would move. - It won't move. Why is this rock so heavy? Let's try once more. Come on. Let's pull together. - One, two, three. - One, two, three. - Goodness. I'm dizzy. - My gosh. This sticked to the ground? Let's try one last time. We can do it. All right. One, two. - Ouch. My finger. - Oh, come on! Why do they call it a wish-rock that we can't even lift? By the way, doesn't he look like the guy who sits next to you? Maybe. He looks kind of funny though. Wait. Excuse me. Please hang on a second. - What is it? - Have you seen this guy? Look carefully. Are you sure it's him? What's this? I don't think he is that built. Maybe it's not him. A missing person, JANG Ho-hun, built Well... To-il, I just wanted to prove something to you. I thought your parents were so mad because you were too good for me and... That's why you stayed two nights in the library? Yes. I have never stayed up the whole night before, so I didn't know I would pass out. Where's your phone? I don't know. Maybe I got it stolen. I didn't ignore your call on purpose. Anyway, I was asleep and someone woke me up. It was your father. And the both of them. You must have been alarmed. I'm sorry, Babe. Babe? Alarmed? Do you think this is just about being alarmed? To-il, where are you going? - To-il, what's wrong? - Don't follow me. I need some time. - To-il, wait up. I... - Don't touch me. Hey, KIM To-il. Where are you going? We should talk. It's okay. Leave her alone. Why are you holding the badminton racket? Come on, To-il. I really didn't do it on purpose. I really lost my phone. - Come on. - Where did you get the racket? - Seriously. - Are you stressed? Do you want to see my arm? Here. It's not yours, is it? Hey! JANG Ho-hun! You brat! To-il, where are you going? What's wrong with you? We are so sorry. Hello. We are Ho-hun's parents. - Oh, I see. - I can't believe this. Ms. KIM, you must have been really stressed. - Don't cross the net! - What? Wait. Give me some time to think. Ms. KIM, you must be really startled. You punk. I understand you, Ms. KIM. To-il, please talk to me. - Listen to me. - Don't come! I said don't come. I don't know. I can't do this. I feel like this will go bad. I don't want it to mess up. I don't want it to mess up, but I think this is going bad. I really feel like this will go bad. I'm not getting married. - What? - What? - Hey. - What are you talking about? - To-il. - To-il. - It's me, Ho-hun. - Why? - What's wrong? - When you're shocked, you cannot think straight sometimes. I get it's hard, but... - To-il, calm down. - Calm down. Will you stop touching the net? - What? - Why so suddenly? Put the badminton racket down. - Come on, To-il. - Calm down. - To-il. - Oh, my. - To-il. - What's wrong? I'm not getting married. - I can't. I can't trust him. - Put that down. I'm so sorry. It was a mistake. It was a once-in-a-life-time mistake. You ruined my marriage from the very beginning. What did you say when I was anxious? I'm sorry, Babe? If you leave like that again, what should I do? What should I do? To-il, I... How can I marry such an unreliable man? Don't marry him. If you don't want to, you can cancel it now. What? To-il, you should make a decision when you're calm. I think you shouldn't make a decision on impulse. - It might be dangerous. - He's right. She might be impulsive now, but she has the intuition to see what's right or not. What? Maybe some can't be qualified as fathers no matter how hard they try. It might be just not their things. Why is a delivery man here, by the way? I get you're disappointed, but my son Ho-hun would never do anything bad on purpose. Even if he didn't mean it, what he did was wrong. We even went to a temple today to find him. And she's pregnant! It's just that Ho-hun is very much driven. You all know that. He must have been so eager to be better he stayed the whole night in the library. He was squeezing water from a stone. You don't have to say that... What's "squeezing water from a stone"? It means that he was doing something pointless. It's a basic Chinese idiom. This family have a weird way of communication. - Are you butting in again? - It's true, though. The two of them always use Chinese idioms to look smart. - To look smart? - JANG Ho-hun. Is this the reason why you want to take a Chinese idiom class? - Well... - Did you get to study some? Don't you have things to deliver? Why do you keep talking like that to him? It's rude. You care about manner only when we're outside. - Goodness. - Goodness? Did you just say Goodness? Did you say Goodness? You told me not to say that! Are you a principal and am I your student? - Come on. - You think I don't know the Chinese idiom? I learned it in middle school. I remember it. I remembered it just now. How could you humiliate me? - Let me talk! - How dare you! You don't listen to me! What is that you want to say? Tell us what you want to say. What's wrong? He's right. What is this all about? I'm scared as hell. Because it's all messed up. We will come to you. Stay there. Don't you swing the racket. Let's go. What are you doing? Come on. At least you got married before you had a divorce. But mine is already messed up. Look at me. What do you mean by messed up? He might disappear again, like my dad did. I mean, like this dad. So you're saying you're scared you might end up like us. Did you think I knew it would end up like that when I married him? I thought we would have a good life. But it turned out we couldn't. Do I have to experience it to know it? I thought I was smart then just like you do. I thought I was smart too. So are you regretful because of me? If I was, I would have quit this already. Why would I have endured it for 15 years? Especially when I had to teach you Chinese idioms to a scary kid like you. I already had enough regrets. But now I think about it, I don't think it was completely messed up. After all, I met you because of him. JANG Ho-hun. To-il, I have thought about it and... You don't have to marry me. - Hey! - You punk. I mean, I want to marry her. But her happiness comes first. The week without you, I felt love's time ran faster than the clock. It's searching a needle in a hay to meet someone like you. As long as you're happy, that's all that matters. He's advancing in leaps and bounds. Are you sure? I'm sure. Of course. Really? I'm not 100 percent sure. But it's okay. Otherwise... Oh, my. Are you okay? Surprise. When did you make this? You're quick-witted. To-il's father did. You were Ms. KIM's father? Oh, my. I had no idea. - We are so sorry. - It's okay. We were so rude to our in-laws. I'm so sorry. Then who is Mr. "Squeezing water from a stone"? He's To-il's father. To-il's... She has two fathers? Which one is your real father? Both of them. I'll get going. Of course I had so many questions I wanted to ask. I had so many. But… This is something a dumb parent should pay for. My ballet school tuition. What did you do with it? I was… really into music back then. I bought a record player. What? I guess this is the only thing I got from you. I don't want other things. Where's Mom? She left first. I used to argue with Mom so much because I didn't want to go to ballet school. I don't think I grew so much after all. Ballet? What do you mean? Your mom was really scary with the dialect. I have never seen that either. The baby's father is such a crybaby. Are you sure you're fine with it? What about it? It's cute. Things like that could be charming sometimes. Did Mom find all the Chinese idioms charming? I had no charm. Your mom was a Captain Marvel. Have you told him everything you wanted to say? What do you mean? You wanted to ask him to march with you at the wedding, didn't you? Oh, right. That. No pressure. I'm fine with either way. Think about whom you would like to walk down the aisle with. - Come on. That's for funerals. - Is this not it? Don't be ridiculous. - Step aside. - See how your mother does it. - That's not it. - Well. I can see you've done it, but it's wrong. - I have done it twice. - Let me show you. I know you've done it twice. Look at her body. Her belly is big. She needs to use her belly. Hold your belly with one hand and put the bouquet here. - Like this. - What's that? There you go. Just like that. Now people will know it. Or you could try this too. - Something like this. - Oh, come on! Okay. Try again. Practice makes perfect. Do it properly. - Oh, it's the monk. - Hello. The menu is ribs stew. Oh, right. You can't eat meat. Let's go. - How is it going? - Hey. It's Ho-hun! - Groom! - Groom! - Hey, gorgeous! - Look at you! Look at how handsome he looks. - You look awesome. - Let's take pictures. Who is this handsome man? Why do you look so gorgeous today? - Gosh, they're so cute. - Mr. and Mrs. Congratulations. Eat as much as you want. Thank you. - Congratulations. - Don't forget to leave the gift money. Okay! Grandpa! Congratulations! I'm To-il's friend. - Oh, I see. - Congratulations. Thank you. What took you so long? Look at the time. I'm so sorry. I left home early, but the traffic was horrible. - You made it. - Congratulations. Mr. CHOI! It's me, Bok-nam! - The wedding will start soon. - Are you Bok-nam? - Mr. CHOI! How have you been? - It's been so long! - Goodness. - Congratulations! Let's get in. Hey, Il-wol. Where's Il-wol? She was right here. Where did she go? Il-wol! - Can I help you? - Il-wol! Where did she go? Ladies and gentlemen, Ms. KIM To-il and Mr. JANG Ho-hun's wedding is starting in a minute. Please wait a second. Please turn off your phone or set it to vibrate or silent mode for the precious moment. Dad, I want to go to the bathroom. Keep it down. Why am I so nervous? Why are you nervous? You're not the one marrying. People might think it's weird. They will only see my belly anyway. By the way, what did you say to Ho-hun then? When? At the badminton court. You whispered something. Oh, that. I said it's okay to have this marriage messed up. What? Now, let's meet the dashing groom, Mr. JANG Ho-hun. Then why do you get married? Mom. Because it might be good too. If not... I can divorce him. Why? Our family is fine too. Ms. KIM, you're entering in a minute. Okay.
