It was the night I decided to give up the struggle and go home. I bought my bus ticket for the next morning and walked to out-of-town news stand. My friend there reminded me that tonight was the night of the Street Festival in Greenwich Village. He said it was something an ambitious young writer shouldn't miss. That night I didn't feel very ambitious, but I had time to kill so I told him I'd go. Here's a memo, to Special Agents Stoker, Harris and Robinson, New York Division, confidential. The fact that we've been upheld on appeal in the Caddie case is of course a source of great satisfaction to me after all these years. Congratulations to you both. Our next problem will be the man who succeeds Caddie and his key position in the syndicate. I see two possibilities, men hand-picked by Caddie five years ago. They are one, Allie the Rod Goner, international list 9667, complete file with photographs available, very vicious. And two, two lives in Greenwich Village, he's quiet, soft-spoken and is known to us as only as Johnny G., no record, no photographs, big ladies man. Younger and brighter than anything we've had to contend with. Boys, it took me 16 years to nail Lou Caddie, and I haven't got that much time to spend on Johnny G. Hello Al? This is Frank over at Foley square, how's it going? Well first I want to thank you for your kind words on the Caddie conviction and then I want a favor. Yeah, say, if your radio-car photographer isn't too busy tonight, I wonder if you could send him down to the Village to see if he can grab a picture of one of the boys. Yeah, he's camera-shy but I just got a tip he's supposed to show up somewhere tonight. Yeah, now listen, he's known as Johnny G. - Look, there's no Johnny G. - Around here and if you don't get out of here I'll call the superintendent. Why don't you call the police? Who's in there? Mr. Gale but he can't be disturbed now he's busy. Are you gonna leave now or not. You know the trouble with you? You don't believe I'm a friend of Johnny's, boy he wouldn't like it if he found out. He's got an awful temper. Look, I never heard of a Johnny G, but I'll go inside and ask Mr. Gale, maybe he's expecting someone. Your a doll. Well. Newspaper photographer pretending he's a friend of yours. He has a camera with him, he wants to take a picture of you Mr. G. Yeah, why does everything have to happen in one day. Look I need time to think, get rid of him. Okay. Mr. Gale says he doesn't know any Johnny G. But Mr. Roberts may be expecting a visitor, if you'll follow me I'll take you to his office, it's just a few doors down. Hey, who's that leaving your office? Looks like the guy I'm after. You're not going to bother Mr. Gale he's got enough on his mind. Look honey will you stop kiddin', I gotta get that guy and take a picture of him. All right, don't look at me, look anywhere but not here. All right, now everybody, nice and easy, let's not get excited. I don't want no trouble, here's the way it is. I been here maybe two, three hours, you've all known me for a long time, my name is Johnny. Mine is Max. Look I'm a playwright, So, If it's an alibi you want and you won't give us any trouble, just leave it all to me. Look, you shut up, will ya? You are not going to bully me. Shut up and listen to me, Don't be a fool. Are you gonna listen to me? No! - My name is Johnny G. - See, you try anything you'll get trouble. Now everything Johnny does, there's a reason behind it. I've got no reason to kill this jerk. I just pulled a little magic trick. First you kill 'em, and then I bring 'em back to life. Now look I'm a little nervous tonight see, so if you're smart, you just make-believe that I'm the boss, this is a business, you'll feel more comfortable that way. You're in trouble Johnny, eh? Can I ask ya a favor young man? You see tonight is sort of a special night. Every August I come back to celebrate the day the owner first opened this shop. It's one night a year. You want I should go huh? So I thought as long you dropped in, I'd like to invite you to join us. Yeah, yeah, don't worry about me. I'm just gonna sit here until I think something out. You go right ahead, have a good time, don't mind me if I snore. Thank you Mr. G., thank you. David and Goliath, and the drama of the night moves on. If the only declines where without a leading lady. What a pity. Yeah, a pretty kid would come in real handy right now. The young pretty ones seldom come in here at this hour. Ten to one says you're wrong. Those are big odds Mr. Johnny, Yeah, I'm already across the finish line. Come on child, well, I've never seen you in here before this late. Hello Leona, I had to see you again before I left. Sit down and tell us where you're going. Back home this morning for good. I've just been to the bus terminal to buy my ticket. I wanna be a writer but I thought in New York I could find what I was looking for, but I guess I give up. I'm Johnny, what's your name? And all I want's an answer, your name? I just want a cup of coffee. All right, we'll give you a name, we'll call you Coffee. I was surprised the New York boys are letting you go. Don't you have a boyfriend? Oh no, well it's, the fellas I met through the girls at work well, they were all alike. We're not all alike. A masterpiece of understatement. You know, if I met you separately, I wouldn't know what to say to you. I'd be afraid of you. And you, I don't know anything about you Mr. Max, and you Mr. Wells, Sidney. Sidney, well at least we could talk about playwriting. Yes, a wiser man than I said, "The play's the thing." I think perhaps I'll say good night. You still have quite a few hours left, may I go along? No, thank you. But how could you resist a challenge? What challenge? The chance to make-up for lost time. You came here to study people, when does your bus leave? 7:42 from the bus terminal. It is a long time to kill. How about you and me movin' around town a little? Stay with all of us. Well. Now look I'm not going anywhere with these two guys, you wanna come with me alone, okay. Please. See that, I have just six hours and it's back home. Maybe forever, maybe just for a month, I don't know. But suddenly I feel very brave, even with you Johnny. So you've gotta date. Three into six goes two, I'll spend two hours with each of you. But who shall be your companion for the first two hours? I was the first to ask so obviously I'll, You'll be the first to get this knife in your belly. Oh please, gentlemen, please. Of course there is only one answer to this problem. - Leona? - Yes, Max. Will you please give me three straws from your broom. Yes. What's this all about? Very simple, we'll draw and the shortest wins. - There you are. - Thank you. Here. It's fair. Oh come on, let's get it over with. I hope I'm first, that's always a very special victory. Now, I win, I got her. Well, as they say, youth must be served. I feel just as I did when I was a little girl starting on a long trip, a little frightened but more alive. I used to look out the train window, try to see every house in every town we passed, it isn't easy when you're going too fast. Please, let's not go too fast tonight Johnny. I guarantee, Guarantee? But you're not safe with me. Johnny you won't forget three o'clock. If she still wants to call you, she can, if she still wants to. Do I have your word on that Johnny? Do you have my word? Yes and I won't worry about her. Don't worry about her. Thank you Johnny. Johnny remember she has a bus to catch. Good night Leona, good night. Good night dear. I suppose you'll laugh if I ask why you brought me up here? Now look. But I'm scared. I don't want what you think I want, you're a little too square for Johnny kid, it's strictly business. Go on. A few wise-guys down there don't expect to see me tonight. But they're gonna see me and they're gonna see me with a pretty girl, you. Smoke? You don't smoke? No. Man. Something happened tonight, didn't it? Yeah. Something in your business? Yeah. Tell me about it Johnny. Nah, you wouldn't understand. Try me. You tell a dame, they're gonna talk. I won't talk Johnny, besides, I'll be leaving in the morning. You forget it, forget I ever said anything, we'll go a few places and have a good time. All right, you're afraid to tell me? Afraid? Yes, you're afraid. All right, you see down there? This whole part of the city it's controlled by a guy named Lou Caddie, the book, the policy, the joints, the whole works. Nobody makes a move without the okay from Lou. Lou's a great guy, see a lot of class, he doesn't like any rough stuff. Everything goes along nice and quiet until two years ago. They sent a team down from Washington to get something on him. Did they? Our operation is plenty smart but they got him on income tax. I was with him this afternoon when they turned his appeal down so it's three to five years. What is it mean to you? Well, Lou turns to me and he says, like nothing happened, he says, "It's all yours now kid, "you and Allie get the whole set up, "even the car keys." Car keys? Yeah, that's where he got his name, Lou Caddie, he always drives a caddie convertible. So it's between Allie and you? Yeah, me and Allie. How can you just lie there like that, our whole world is turning upside down? What's going to happen to everything? What's going to happen to you Allie? What's the matter, afraid I won't be able to pay the bills? Oh don't talk like that, it's just that I was wondering, I know kid, I know, I've been wondering too. The way I got it figured kid, Yes, go on, You sure are worried, still hungry like you were when we first got married. I paid for the car and the coat, you love me huh? Well what happens if the money stops rolling in? Nothing's definite. That could never happen. Ah what's the difference. The way I got it figured out I'm one of the top men. That's what I thought. You will be top man then? Oh no, not alone. I'll probably have to split the territory with Johnny G. Why? Why what? Why can't it all be yours? Well because that's the way Lou wants it, as far as I was able to learn. And who gave Lou such a big territory to control? Well it happened years ago, back in the 20's and nobody gave it to him, he took it, took it from the others. He didn't know what the meaning of the word of the word fair was did he? No, and neither do I, what is it? You heard me, take it all over, cut Johnny G out. What are you talkin' about, Lou would never go for a deal like that. Did Lou come right out and say it had to be a fifty-fifty deal? Well no, no not yet, but everybody figures that this is the way it's gotta be. Everybody figures that neither or Johnny are as strong as Lou, control has to be split. But if you made your move, Lou might yell and maybe he wouldn't. Maybe he'd admire you for your guts? Yeah. Which one's going to be boss Johnny? That's it, that's gotta be decided tonight. He doesn't care which one it is, he just wants to leave things behind to the strongest guy. Are you the strongest? Would you like to try a little sample? - Come on. - What are you gonna do? I'll show 'em just how strong Johnny G is, you watch me. But Allie, does he, That rat-bum, he really thinks he's gonna be top man. He's got a funny sense of humor. You ever stopped to realize what it would be like running the territory with Johnny as your partner? Johnny G., I've hated his guts ever since we were kids. It would be some hot situation all right. From what you told me the crime commission's gonna bear down awfully heavy this year and if you're fighting between yourselves, then you'll end up like Lou Caddie. Shut up, maybe you're right. Lou doesn't like it though, he'll put me up before the board and I may get hit. But if he doesn't, I get the whole jackpot. And Johnny? Might be worth the gamble. Where is Allie? I don't know, but we'll go a few places and if I know Allie he's gotta make his move, he can't afford having think I took over already. Johnny, Don't you worry kid, we had fights before, there won't be any shootin', so don't you cross me, you're going along, I'll see ya out of the way when the action comes. You wanted to see the big town, okay now's your chance. Johnny's sightseeing tour begins, right now. * But if you forget * Whoever you do kiss * Remember and keep me * In your heart * I'll always love you * * Don't go too far away * * I know that we'll be back together * * Someday This is A, right now before it gets too late. I want you to let every location know, all the boys, it's me, not Johnny G., I'm taking over everything Lou left behind and I'm counting Johnny G. Out of the game. And I want he should know it, right now, got it? All right. What da ya think Johnny's going to do? I want him bad, I want him for years and I think tonight, tonight's the night he gets his. * I'll always love * * Don't go too far away * * I know that we'll be back together * * Someday King in his castle. It's not my castle yet, might be someday. We just meet here, meet Lou, talk things over. How can you hear each other with all this music? Oh we hear each other but the law can't hear us. Funny thing about Lou, when we talk, my heart always understands what's in his heart. When Johnny leaves call us upstairs but don't let him see you. It's awfully smokey and noisy. He's not here, wanna cut out? Yes. Am I acting the way you wanted me to? Yeah, yeah you look real great kid. By now Allie knows we're making the rounds. We haven't seen him yet. No, but the word gets around, he'll show. When he does, do you want me to leave? Yeah, when you hear me say, "That's Allie," you take this, you take it, you grab a cab and you beat it. Just like that? Just like you never saw me before, that way you can't get hurt. What about you Johnny? Don't you worry about me, when I get through with that rat. That's not what I mean. I mean doesn't it feel funny to have somebody just turn and walk out of your life? Without even saying good-bye? Well now you see, the rules they make up about how people should act, they don't go for guys like me. I gotta move alone. Angie used to say that I was like a wild animal, like a tiger. Who's Angie, is she your girlfriend? No, no Angie was the janitor's daughter. She wasn't anybody's girlfriend, but she sure ha but she sure had a lot of friends. But you, you've had girlfriends, haven't you? Yeah, yeah as many as any other guy. What are you asking me all these questions for? Well I don't know, I guess I just wanna understand you a little better. After all when Allie shows up, well, I'll never see you again. You know for a second I forgot all about Allie. You're a funny kid. Smoke? You square. Tiger. What did you do that for? There's nobody around to see us now. Yeah that's right. Well. Well, look at me baby. What for? - Johnny! - Mickey. What is it, Mickey? Lou sent me Johnny, he heard Allie sent word for you to clear out. Yeah, well, he didn't think I would, did he? You know how Lou feels about it. He's leaving it up to both of you. Go on. Well he figured Allie'd have more sense than to tangle with you. He figured you'd talk it out. Well we all did but Allie turned big shot, he's gonna get it. Johnny it's not like that anymore. The law's too smart today Johnny, we can't go wild in the streets. What are you trying to tell me Mickey? He wants both of you at Poley's bar to talk it out, before you both go crazy and start a lot of trouble. That's an order Johnny. And Allie? Same goes for him. Okay. What about me? You come on over to Poley's, you'll be safe over there. Maybe that creep with come to his senses. But you'll have to wait out front when you see Allie in the backroom. - Okay with you? - Yes. Let's go. Have a wait there Johnny. Is Allie here already? He must be, I left Lou sitting here, come on. Don't you go see, I'm getting used to having you around. Johnny, it's Mickey, suppose it's a trap and they're waiting for you in there with guns. Look, Mickey is Lou's boy, not Allie's, he's okay. You've been reading too many mystery stories. And if you wait you're gonna be late for your second date with that creep writer. Will you wait? I'll wait. I don't wanna be disturbed, no matter who. Carl where's Allie? In the backroom Mimi. Johnny come? He's in there too, they're talking, sit down, she belongs to Johnny. If Allie comes out, tell him I've gone fix my make-up. Purse, I, Here it is. Let's walk. It doesn't figure. Did you settle it, please tell me. I gotta give credit to Lou, he's got class, he knows how to handle things. He told Allie to drop the pressure bit and talk things out, peaceful and he did. We'll divide the territory up fifty-fifty, that's it. But Allie didn't really mean it, about you having to get out. Oh he meant it all right, earlier, I guess he got, he got yella. Johnny. Yeah. Remember you said Allie wouldn't use a gun if you two fight? Why are you so sure? Well you see, Allie and I were brought up by the same old man, like brothers. His father died and he came to live with us when he was three years old. But what does that have to do with the guns? My, my old man was walking across the street from a store, it was back in the 30's, a bunch of guys came by in a car, they were all set to blast someone, he got in the way. Oh, I'm sorry Johnny. He was 100% legit my old man. When they called Allie and me outta school, we went over to where he was lying in the street. He made us promise one thing, not to ever, Use guns? I see. I feel so sorry for you Johnny. Sorry? Yes because you are like a tiger, you're brave and you're strong, but you're not free, you're trapped. And a wild animal that's trapped can't be happy. Ah look, maybe some of us down here in the Village grow up tough, see, but we've got things those guys uptown never had, sincerity, friends, not for a week or a month but for a lifetime. But so much trouble in that lifetime. We've gotta protect what's ours, when someone tries to take something away from ya you gotta fight for it with everything you've got, there's bound to be trouble. And don't tell me it's any difference in business because it isn't. Do you really believe that? Look, look, my old man he had two grocery stores, strictly legit and one of these great big chains came in and they tried to squeeze him right outta one, they did. Well nobody's gonna squeeze Johnny out of nothing see. No matter who gets hurt? Oh look, go find yourself some sucker will ya, have kids, you'll never understand guys like me. That's not fair, I've been trying. Yeah, well you haven't had it tough enough that's all. Look you've gotta date with that creep don't ya, go on, go on, get outta here. What do you wanna to out with a guy like that for anyway, what are you after tonight? Well, first I thought talking to three completely different men, I might find something to write about. But now, I just want to solve the puzzle of Johnny G. I'm beginning to, there's just one thing about you. I can't ever forgive. What's that? I'm sorry, Don't be sorry for me. I'd rather be a lion for a day than a mouse all my life. Someday the world is gonna belong to guys like me. I'd like to have you around. Do you believe me? I don't know, good-bye Johnny. Hey what was that one thing you were talking about? Hello, this is Coffee, is this Mr. Wells? Bravo young lady, you survived the notorious Johnny G. I guess, I'd love to see some of the things you've written, is there a restaurant near your house or we can talk somewhere? I think it's important for you to see my place. It's real Village and without attics like mine, I fear all writing talent would disappear into the Madison Avenue jungle. All right, I'm sold, okay, good-bye. Oh Coffee, come in. Oh, it's just as you said it was. Sit down my dear. Well, how was your date with Johnny G or shouldn't a gentleman ask? I don't want to talk about it. I'm afraid I can't explain tonight while I'm living it. Well I'll try to help make the evening interesting. I think I understand what you mean by living, Coffee. Do you? Oh it really is just like Paris, at least it's the way I always imagined Paris would look, a room like this, and those rooftops, are these your books Mr. Wells? What does an author read? There you are, there all very dry I'm afraid. I use them mostly for research. But I thought you were a playwright? I never dreamed that starving Bohemian would have nothing but books on architecture. Would you like a drink, I imagine you need it Coffee. No thank you. About the books, Coffee, even a Bohemian has to live. So I buy and sell second hand textbooks. Now that you know my secret I hope you're not too disappointed, it does pay for the rent. Well, show me some of the things you've written. That's why I came up here. Is that why you came here? Yes, please show them to me. But first, tell me, is it near six o'clock yet? No, nowhere near that, that's a strange question. Your bus doesn't leave til after seven. That's right. Well now, here we have something, not too ambitious, nevertheless my own. But why should a lonely playwright waste time watching a lovely child read when he could be talking to her. Oh we could have talked back at Leona's, don't forget you don't have to work in an insurance office. You're a full time writer. Do you honest expect me to believe that the reason you came up here was to read what I've written. What exactly did you think I had in mind? Well, after all Coffee, you are a very beautiful girl, and I am a man. Are you really the poor playwright you pretend to be? Do you remember Coffee, you said this was a magic night. Let's not spoil it. I'm afraid we don't understand each other. How are we apart Coffee? What is it, Just something about you I don't understand. Something I'd rather not understand. Your typical of the young girls of today. You'll give yourself freely to a Johnny G., but to an artist, who needs you, who deserves you, you have no time to talk, no time to be human and warm? No time to be any of the things a woman should be to a man? Girls like you have been doing that too often. I didn't mean to hurt you. Please. I don't want to hurt you, please, No! Please don't make me hurt you. I'll tell him. There's no one to tell Coffee, there's no one here but me. Johnny knows where I am. No. Johnny'll kill you. Johnny, Johnny, Johnny. The power of his name, you poor sick man, just his name. Get out. What's right, what's wrong, I don't know anymore. The rules say Johnny's bad but just his name stopped you. Why, I wanna know. Get out, leave me alone, leave me alone! Still working on me. Is he badly hurt? No, just a scratch, I called Lou and asked him to hold a little board of directors meeting when the doc was patching me up. Yeah, so what happened? They did and they took the lid off for me when they hear when they heard what happened. You mean? It's official, the sky's the limit, I can do what I want. Allie wants everything and that's exactly what he's gonna get, everything. Watch out for him Johnny, you see how bad, It's knife against knife now, no more words. We're gonna meet at six o'clock in front of Lou's house, right in the street where we played when we were kids. Where pop died and that's where we'll settle it. I guess it has to be that way. Johnny, It's the only way I know kid, it's gotta be. Johnny, be careful this morning. Sure, sure I promise not to cross the street to get Allie unless the light's green. But do me a favor will ya kid, What is it Johnny? I like to know what the score is, what was that one thing about the way I operate that you can't understand? It's not that I can't understand it, Johnny, I just can't forgive it. Go on. You'll be angry. Go on, what's on your mind? It's the young Johnny G.'s, the juvenile delinquents, the kids who are falling in your footsteps, there the worst problem we have and you're training them, you're encouraging them. What's the matter you crazy or something? Don't you know these kids are the biggest headache we've got? All they do is get into stupid messes that break the papers and bring the heat down on all of us. You mean? I mean if that's what you want, I'll give you the inside story. Johnny I don't understand. Look, they're great kids see, but they don't know what the real score is, they think it's like it was back in Prohibition, it's not. Go on Johnny. Look, these kids are figuring they're running real cute, see, out front, with the law behind 'em, well, it ain't that way. The law is, it get's ahead of them see, like a roadblock, waiting for 'em and they hit it head on. What about men like you Johnny? Look we operate so close to the way some business men and politicians operate you can't tell the difference. We got plenty of federal headaches to keep us busy, we don't want any part of these kids. They had it tough and they got pushed around, just like we did when we were kids. Only the way the law is today they gotta end up losing, let 'em know that, maybe some of 'em will calm down a little and play it cool and make a few fast business dollars instead of, Johnny do you think they'd listen? Listen to what? Listen to me, if I could write what you just told me would it convince them, even a few of them? It might, I'm just saying that the odds are against 'em, it's not worth the game, you write it like a story see, you keep me out of it, I'm no preacher. I know but you don't realize how important this is, but coming from your side of the fence, Maybe this is the story you were looking for, huh kid? Oh yes Johnny it is. Mickey. Yeah Johnny, I gotta think a little about my meeting with cutey boy Allie, why don't you and he run along huh? You got a meeting with that old plasterer don't you? Yes, I was just going to phone him. Yeah, well you let me know the place, when I get through with Allie I'll pick you up and drive you to the bus station in real style, in a caddie. Thank you Johnny. I've done all I can do for you. I know doc, the rest is up to me. Here they are, what beautiful dolls in the world. Oh Max, for the first time tonight I feel young again. I never knew life could change a person so much. But in the last few hours I've grown very old. Don't be in a hurry to get old child, it comes soon enough. Do you like her, Little Princess? Oh yes, she's beautiful. I'm glad you picked her out, she's one of my favorites, please take her with you. Oh Max I couldn't. I want you to have her as a souvenir of tonight. Well what time is it? Time, 5:35. So how's it gonna be? Just like you said boss, at exactly six o'clock. Johnny's agreed to walk up the middle of the street from one end of the block and Allie from the other. They'll fight it out with their fists. With their knives too. Let's not kid ourselves Mickey, Well I told them that you, I know, I know Mickey, then what? They want you to give the winner the keys to the car like it's official. The winner takes over everything, see what I mean. I see Mickey, will the boys all be watching? There up at Pete's apartment playing cards, they'll be watching from the window up there. And at least it's quiet out there, there'll be nobody passing by at this hour. With those two guys it oughtta be over pretty quick. Yeah. - Mickey. - Yeah. I hope it's Johnny. Yeah. Allie, I'm worried. I gotta face him like Lou says, right out on the street, like he said, that way at least Lou gives me the keys everybody's gotta admit I'm top man. But supposing, supposing Johnny's quicker than you Allie? Look baby, you don't take me for a fool do you? I figured this whole thing out, I know how fast Johnny is with a knife, with his right hand. - What do you mean? - I had him taken care of. By now that shoulder of his is so stiff he'll be a cinch to take, maybe won't even fight. You know you don't believe that, I wish you were right. You ever stop to think what happens if you're wrong? It's the end of everything for you and I, you'll never be able to operate again in this city. Yeah but with that shoulder? Don't be a fool, when Johnny's the way he is tonight he could use that knife if his arm were broken. A bum arm's a bum arm and nothing's gonna talk him into working quicker than this. I tell you I got him. Supposing something goes wrong, supposing, Supposing nothing, Have you ever stopped to think about how your life would be if Johnny takes over and pushes you out? What are you driving at? Just this, don't walk out on that street with only a knife. Take this with you in case. I know all about the promise you made to your old man but just in case Allie, just in case. Look the whole neighborhood knows about that promise. Listen to me big boy, tomorrow at this time the neighborhood's gonna respect the winner and only the winner. Does that go for you too kid? Me too. I want you to tell Lou something for me when you see him. Sure Johnny, anything you want. If things go bad for me at six, I want you should have what's left of my territories. Don't talk like that Johnny, you're strong than him, you're quicker than he ever was. Yeah but who knows how the cards will turn, I might slip on a banana peel. Yeah, yeah, more likely you'll, Look, if I do get delayed, I want you should get the car keys, pick up the girl and drive her to the bus station, Johnny's compliments. Coffee? Yep. Okay, you know it's funny Johnny, if I didn't know you too well I'd say you were falling for that square little kid. Yeah, yeah it's real funny. You are worrying about Johnny G don't you, Coffee? You like him? Is that so strange Max? Yes, I worry about him, I have to find out Max, it's too much right with Johnny for him to be all wrong. More wrong with him than I'll admit, one thing I do know, the young Johnny's, the one's who're copying him, the Johnny's with their switchblade knives, cutting their initials into tomorrow, he gave me a message for them. It's the story I found tonight, Max, that's the story I'm gonna write. You have children, they're very important subject my dear, but even their story, those Johnny G.'s it's a very old one and the ending is always the same. Always? Yep, always the same, so don't feel too bad about it, a very wise man once wrote that, "Perhaps with some people "it must be this way.". Must? Thoreau put it this way, "If a man does not keep pace "with his companions, "perhaps it is because he hears a different drummer. "Let him step to the tune which he hears, "however measured or far away." What's the matter, yella? Catch! Like I told ya kid, someday the whole world's gonna belong to guys like me, I'm so glad you're all right Johnny, I knew you'd come for me. Okay square. Okay tiger. What happened to Allie? I don't want to talk about it baby, I'm tired. Good for one way, it oughta read round trip, because just as soon as I can I'm coming back Johnny. I wish I'd met you when we were very young. I'll remember you, Johnny, all my life.
