(suspenseful music plays) (beep) Boss, we're in. Excellent. And the goods? Tons of high-tech loot, just like you said, boss. Just like you said. (quiet whooshes) (whooshing through air) Look out! (blows landing, grunting) (theme playing) MAN (on TV): I'm afraid it's true, Kincaid. I'm not your stepbrother; I'm your half-sister. (gasps) ANNOUNCER: We interrupt this program for a Channel 6 news exclusive. There was a daring robbery earlier tonight at a high-tech midtown laboratory. A nearby surveillance camera captured this image of four bizarre green creatures. (gasps) Leonardo! Michelangelo! Donatello! Raphael! You rang? I fear you have been careless tonight, my sons. The secret of our existence has been compromised. What, tonight? I haven't been out. Mikey? Negatory. Master Splinter, we've been cooped up in here with you all night. Then how in the world do you explain... this? NEWSMAN: The image of the four creatures is a bit grainy, but even so, you can make out what appear to be four large Turtles. Wha...? Huh? Huh? Huh? RAPHAEL (chuckles): It's... it's got to be some kind of gag, right? I am not laughing, Raphael. NEWSMAN: In other news, unusual underground seismic activity continues to be reported throughout Manhattan. Here. I've got the image. DONATELLO: They do look like us. Whoever "they" are. DONATELLO: Who are they fighting? SPLINTER: The Purple Dragons! So Hun's behind all this turtle-y fun? Are you guys seeing this? It's all over the news. We see it, April-- and we're about to get to the bottom of it. It was a sweet score, boss. We grabbed all kinds of high-tech goodies. But the real prize is right in here. (beeping) (mechanical whirring, thumping) We got 'em, boss, we finally got 'em. Say hello... to the Ninja Turtles. Huh? You were expecting maybe somebody else? Uh, I don't know who these freaks are, but they're not the Turtles. Chumley, if we're not the Turtles, I don't know who is. (others chuckling) Good one, Raphael! We, uh, found this on them. Ninja type stuff. Right, boss? Hmm... Hey. Don't you owe us one phone call? Like, I totally know who I'm calling. ALL: Pizza delivery! (1988 Turtles laughing) Oh! What is this? That's just ooze. We fight old bucket-breath over that stuff all the time! "Old bucket-breath"? You know-- old frying-pan face. Chrome dome? Metal mouth? Tin teeth. (dog growling) What are you freaks talking about? A mind like a steel trap, this one. Know what I'm saying? Hello? We're talking about Shredder. What does this have to do with the Shredder? Like Michelangelo said, it's just some mutagen we stopped Shred-head from getting his claws on. (bubbling) Mutagen? Hmm... Hmm? I'd be careful with that if I were you. (slurping) (squeaking) (deep growling) (fierce screeching) What the...? (screeches) (insect groans) Hmm, this could really come in handy... especially if the Shredder is back. Uh, what do you want us to do with these guys, boss? I've already got four Turtles to worry about. These are superfluous. Nice knowing you, Superfluous. (men chuckling) MAN: What the...? Aah! (blow lands) (all grunting and groaning) Ohh! Aah! (glass breaking) Get it off me! (barking) Hope you don't mind, but we let ourselves in. Actually, it kind of looks like we're already here. Hey, those dudes look just like us. Don't flatter yourselves! (both grunting) That's our cue! (grunting) (grunting) Raph! Look out! (grunting continues) Thanks, bro! Thanks, bro! (gasps) (fierce grunt) (groans) 1988 MICHELANGELO: Excuse me! Aah! Sweet! They got little initials on their belt buckles! Like superheroes! Whoa! (laughs): Yeah! (grunts) Fascinatin'! Little help here, Mikey? You got it! You got it! Cowabunga! (clangs) (yells) Cool off, dude! Heh-heh! "Cool off," he says. Huh. (loud grunting) ALL: Turtle Power! How can you not love these guys? (grunts) (grunts) (grunting) (grunts) (grunting) (cracking, rumbling) (clamoring) (yells) (all yelling) 1988 MICHELANGELO: Whoa! Now, that was off the wall! Come on! (groans) Let's stay in touch. All right, time for some answers. Who the shell are you guys? I was about to ask you the same question. Don't get cute. We can't help it-- we were born that way. Look, we just risked our shells rescuing you from Hun and the Purple Dragons. So I think we're entitled to some answers. He's right. They've earned it. Absolutely. So... spill! You bet. Right after lunch! What? No! DONATELLO: Uh, what are they doing? (people yelling) That's it-- they're toast! We can't go running around in broad daylight! Doesn't seem to be stopping them. Hey there! How's it going? (gasps) Hello. Hi. If they get spotted by the wrong... Come on, time to call in reinforcements. I'm starving. I could eat a whole pie myself! (1988 Turtles laughing, people gasp) (all sighing happily) (people screaming) Score! No line! We'll take four large pizzas, with sauerkraut, tuna fish, pretzels and jelly beans. (yelling and screaming) Maybe they're out of jelly beans? (sirens blare) (police radio chatter) Huh? Uh-oh, the boys in blue! Let's slip out the back! Whoa! Hey! Let us out of here! What's going on? Let us go! (all grunt) Hey! What's the big idea! You totally picked the wrong... Huh? (gasps) (fuming) Master Splinter? You know me? Well, yeah, but... Did you get a perm job or something? You look, uh, different. Come to think of it, everything's been looking a little different lately. Yeah. Ever since that big explosion, New York just hasn't been the same. Explosion? Yeah, during our, uh, battle with Shredder. The Shredder? Perhaps it would be best if you started from the beginning. Well... we were mixing it up inside the Shredder's ultimate weapon, the Technodrome, trying to keep him from getting his claws on some vials of mutagen. We were looking for a way to end the fight once and for all, when Don had a rockin' idea-- use the Technodrome's own transdimensional portal to send it back from whence it came. (electrical zapping) Don started working his techno-magic, but... (weapons firing) (zapping) (all trembling) (zapping intensifying) The next thing we knew, we were back in the city. And we got back to doing what we do best-- taking down scuzz-buckets. Hun and the Purple Dragons. But maybe we're not in Kansas anymore. Not our Kansas, anyway. Dude, are you saying... I'm saying the Technodrome's transdimensional portal might have zapped us all to a different world. This Shredder of yours, he's here, too? (groans) Our path is clear. Together we must find this Technodrome. It may be the only way to get these four home. 1988 MICHELANGELO: Whoa! (laughter) Noogie! Cut it out, you guys. (laughter) RAPHAEL: The sooner the better. (starter cranking, engines stalling) MALE COMPUTER VOICE: Primary engines off-line. Blasted machine! (electrical crackling) How does a minor battle with those annoying Turtles cause the engines to...? (alarm sounding) What the devil? A temporal anomaly? It seems the transdimensional portal has thrown the Technodrome into an entirely different dimension. (angry yell) I hate those Turtles. (shrill beeping) What now? Perimeter breach, perimeter breach. DONATELLO: You were right, uh, Donatello. Tracking the recent weird seismic activity has led us straight to the, uh, Technodrome! RAPHAEL: A giant golf ball on wheels? That's your Shredder's ultimate weapon? 1988 SHREDDER: Eight Turtles? I don't know how this came to be, but soon there will be none. (Turtles gasp and grunt) 1988 SHREDDER: Destroy them, all of them. With great pleasure, Master Shredder. BeBop and Rocksteady? Say your prayers, Turtles. (shouting, firing weapons) Uh, so how do you guys normally handle these situations? 1988 TURTLES: Turtle power! Whoo-hoo! All right! Don't you just love these guys? Cowabunga! 1988 TURTLES: Cowabunga! Whoo-hoo! Geez, it's like having five Mikeys now. (grunting) Huh? Robots? Exploding robots. (chuckles) (BeBop chuckles) Ha, whoa! Yeah! Whoa! Ha! Prepare to get plasmarized. I don't think so. (grunts) Huh? Oh! Oh. Yah! (laughter) I'm gonna pulverize you shellbags. Sure. Oh! (grunts) (Raphael grunting) Hyah! (grunting) Just as soon as you get out on parole. (laughs) (laughing) Cut it out, guys. I'm trying to fight here. (grunts) Yeah, who wants some? Ha! Ahh! Yeah, hey! Ha-ha! Stee-rike! I'll give you a strike! (muttering) Wow, what a hard case. Bro, I could tell you stories. Aah, blasted Turtles! (groans) Shredder, you bungling idiot. I'm in the middle of something here, Krang. First you get us stuck in this infernal dimension and now you struggle... (belches) ...to defeat these primitive creatures. If my troops from Dimension X were here... Oh, quit nagging about Dimension X. We're having enough trouble in this dimension. Can't you see there are eight Turtles now? Wait. That's it. Of course. If this dimension has its own version of the Turtles, perhaps it has its own Shredder as well. Ooh, and maybe even its own Krang. Why, that would be wond... MALE COMPUTER VOICE: (beeping) Excellent. Now, let's buy ourselves a little time. (electronic whirring and beeping) Whoa! (whirring and beeping) What gives? (sustained whirring and beeping) (straining) Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! BOTH: Whoa! ROCKSTEADY: Wait for us! Hold up, boss! (both grunt) (engine starts) (all gasping) (engine whining) (shudders) RAPHAEL: Come on, they're making a run for it! (screaming) (all gasping) Hmm, nothing comes up for Krang in this dimension. What? Shredder, on the other hand... there he is and he is magnificent. What strength, what power. (grunting on-screen) Oh, how I've longed for an ally such as this, so unlike the sniveling idiots that I've been forced to suffer. I'm right here. I can hear you! (belches) Now, to find him. (blipping and trilling) Hmm, strange. He's off-world. No matter. I will program the matter transporter to beam him to us directly. (zapping) This is a turning point, Krang. The world will tremble before the combined power of mighty Shredder and his... (zapping stops) Huh? Pink slug? Oh... I wanted a super sinister ally. Oh, I don't know, he looks all right to me. (belches) Could that puny creature actually be this dimension's Shredder? (belches) Quiet. MALE COMPUTER VOICE: Commencing cryoregeneration. (sizzling) (both yell) No. Fool, you overcooked him, didn't you? I did everything exactly right. It should have worked. It should be alive. KRANG: You botched it. You botched it! (growling) (gasps) Oh-ho-ho! (straining) You forget who you talk to, you whimpering-- ugh!-- worm! Aah! I am the Shredder! I know who you are. Let go. What fools are these, so weary of life... Wha...? What...? ...that they take the name of the Shredder... ...my name-- in vain? Huh? Huh? (growls) (grunting and groaning) (growls) And this is our engine room, currently under repair unfortunately. (phone ringing) Oh, please excuse me, most honored guest. (snarling) Krang, what's taking so long? I can't keep this alien entertained forever. All is ready... (sinister chuckle) ...Mighty Shredder. Just give the word. The word, you smug slug, is given. (chuckles) (growling) You... Uh... (grunting) (both grunting) Little man, you have made a grave... a grave... (snarls) ...a grave... (1988 Shredder grunts) (pants) I thought he could help us defeat the Turtles, but he-he's insane. Perhaps we may still learn something useful di... (belches) ...dissecting it, hmm? MALE COMPUTER VOICE: Intruder alert. (alarm blaring) Intruder alert. KRANG: Aah! (metal clattering) (all gasp) (shouting) (all gasp) (exhales) (grunting) (fierce yell) I am called Karai. (yells in horror) I am his daughter. Not much of a family resemblance. (grunts) (whimpers) According to this, the Technodrome's close. (tires squealing) (crashing) Whoa! Hey, everyone all right? What the shell? (dog snarling, barks) (deep growling) Uh... you didn't tell us you had family in town. And you didn't tell me your doppelgangers were carrying super-powered mutagen. What's he talking about? (growling) (all gasp) That stuff barely splattered my man here. (ferocious growl) Imagine what I could do with more. (panicked shouts) (growling) Hi-yah! (growls, whines) (grunting and groaning) Give me that mutagen. I don't think so. (groaning) (grunting) (yelling) (groaning) (deep growling) (gasps) Leo! Leo! No! (deep roaring) Incoming! (explosion) (grunting) (groaning) (metal clanging) (quiet groan) Father! Are you all right? I... believe so. "Father"? We need to get you back to the lair. Whoo-hoo! Time to hit the sewers, my brothers! Yeah! All right! (strained grunting) These things are a lot heavier in your dimension. RAPHAEL: Out of the way, tubby! (manhole cover sliding) All right, everybody into the pool. P.U.! Your sewers really stink! Um, you don't have any nostrils. Touché. Yeah! Hey. What about the Technodrome? That crate moves about as fast as you guys. We'll catch up to it. Hey! (growling) (yells) (grunts) (all yell, grunting) (Raphael yelling, 1988 Donatello whimpering) (screaming) Ha! Mine! Hun wins again! Um, you might want to take a closer look, Mr. Winner. Huh? (sizzling) (yelling) (fierce yell) (grunts) Oh! Get this crud off! Let's not stay in touch. No...! Get it off me! Get it off me...! (deep growling) (growls) (gears grinding) (mechanical whirring) Hun... my old friend. You! Having a bad day? Look what they've done to me! Accursed Turtles! Perhaps we have common cause once again, you and I. Yes? Yes... master. DONATELLO: I don't understand it. The tracking system was closing in, and then suddenly, poof!-- static. It's like the Technodrome disappeared. Any idea what we should do next? Oh, oh! Me! Me! I know! I know! Other than going out for a slice? Uh. Oh. (Leonardo groans) I told you, you can't brainstorm with these goofballs. They ain't got no brains! Hey! We resemble that remark. (laughter) 1988 MICHELANGELO: Good one, dude! (power tools whirring) (hammering and chiseling) How go the repairs, Karai? Very well, Father. The technology of Dimension X is ridiculous, but once revised with Utrom science, it will prove devastating. Yes, the two merge well together. This new body is proof of that. KARAI: And more proof-- their robotic Foot Soldiers. Clumsy, weak, almost... (crackling) ...cartoonish. (metal clanging) (weapon firing) But now... with the proper modifications--... ...lethal! Our human troops have also been upgraded. By analyzing the mutagen that infected Hun, we have successfully engineered our own mutant army! (screaming in agony) (deep growling) Soon I will bring this world to its knees! And then... 1988 SHREDDER: Wait! Stop! Come back here with my command chair! That's an order! And then, perhaps, the world of my worthless counterpart. Infinite possibilities have been opened to me, thanks to this Technodrome. I shall rule the multiverse, Karai. Computer... (beeping) This is the Shredder. I wish to learn about alternate dimensions. Show me... everything! (zapping) (evil laughter) Listen, guys, we've tangled with Shred-head and his Technodrome plenty of times. In fact, we got all kinds of special anti-Technodrome gear back home for just such an occasion. Special anti-Technodrome gear? Certainly, but like Leonardo said, it's back in our home dimension. We'll need to build some kind of transdimensional portal stick to get there-- a gateway into other dimensions-- but small enough to fit into most overhead compartments. Donni, whatever he's talking about, can it be done? We've seen time-travel windows, cybermat transporters-- but a dimensional portal in a stick? It sounds... well, silly. No offense. Come on, Mr. Wizard. It'll be easy. (beeping) (power tools whirring, hammering and chiseling) KRANG: You're not the only one who needs to use the transdimensional portal you know. Open up! What are you doing in there anyway? (gasps and groans) (body thuds) My body! (whimpering) Insolent slug. The Shredder's business is his and his alone. (yells) Do not seek to interrupt him again. (groans) Father, what is it? What's wrong? What did you see in there? Turtles, Karai. Ninja Turtles. I must have them-- both teams. At once. Yes, revenge at last! I knew you'd come through. Together we can crush the Turt... (yelling, metal clattering) Hun! (footsteps thumping) Tonight you hunt. Find those who did this to you and bring them to me. It will be done, Master. Okay, stand back. (pulsating tones) (electrical crackling) (device slows down and stalls) Huh. That should have worked. Should have worked? That'll never work. That's not a transdimensional portal stick. That's... a flashlight. It was a flashlight. But with a little rewiring and a lot more positive thinking, it'll soon be a transdimensional portal stick. Now hand me that hammer. This is a wrench. Details. Science isn't all about facts, you know. (metallic clanging) (rumbling) (both gasping) (rumbling) (explosion) What the shell? Turtles! Oh, no! How'd they find us? They followed their nose. (sniffing) The nose knows. (laughter) (grunting) Who disturbs the sanctity of my home? Don't you recognize me, rodent? Huh? Huh? Hun? Come examine your son's handiwork. (growling) (weapons firing) (growling) (yells) (yawning) Is it noon already? (1988 Turtles gasp, weapons firing) (panicked yelling) (groaning) (growling and grunting) (growling) (fierce yell) (groaning) Robots 2.0? (yelling) (grunting) So what's with the new look, Gruesome? That mutagen turned me into the last thing I touched. (grunts) Mutant Turtle filth! It's not true. We shower regularly. (growls) (gasps) (gasps) (all grunting) Why are you here, Hun? What do you want? You have no idea what this is about, do you? You don't even know he's back. He? The one true Shredder. Huh?! Huh?! Huh?! (fierce grunt) (cracking) (steam hissing) (shudders) (whimpering) (groans) (groans) Oh... oh! (soft groan) ALL: Master Splinter! (growls) (all gasping in horror) (whimpering) (zapping) (zapping) What just happened? Where's Master Splinter? LEONARDO: Where are we? Cowabunga! Dudes! Oh, yeah! All right! 1988 MICHELANGELO: We're home! (cheers and laughter) What? This is your dimension? Why does it all look so...? (music plays on boom box) ...weird? Yup. There's no place like home! What the shell are we doing here? We got to go back! Master Splinter's in who-knows-what kind of trouble. Donatello ported us out just before your roof flattened us into pizza pies. Told you it'd work. We're going back. We'll save Splinter, and we're stopping that Technodrome. But we've got another problem. Hun mentioned the one true Shredder. And you know what that means. Our little alien Utrom is back. Utrom Shredder? Sounds Swedish. (laughter) Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! Can't you guys be serious about anything? They're right. This is serious. I say we had to our lair, pick up our anti-Technodrome gear and go put it to good use. But first, we've got to save April. (grunting) (muttering gibberish) (laughing) (growling) (screaming) We save April at least once a day. ALL: Yeah! You can set your watch to it. (whimpering) (clanging) (thudding) (fierce growl) (nervous whimper) Was that a mutant... banana? This dimension is seriously messed up. 1988 TURTLES: Cowabunga! Boy, when you guys are out of town, the threats on my life sure do pile up. (gasps) There are eight of you now! Holy scoop! Wait. You're April? Um, what's with the yellow jumpsuit? Do you work at a carwash in this dimension? I'm a reporter, April O'Neil. And you are my ticket to a Peabody. Sorry, April. No time for an exclusive. We've got to get these guys to the lair. (growling) (screaming) Follow me! (clamoring) Oh, my eye! (yelling) (groaning and laughing) 1988 SPLINTER Welcome home, my Turtles. (gasps) And my Turtles? I'll get that gear together, and we'll be on our way in no time. Ow! ALL: Noogie! Oh! Hey, cut it out! (laughter) Please, take this moment to nourish your body and soul as you prepare for the challenge that lies ahead of you. Thank you... Master. My brothers and I have found your dimension to be... well... disorienting, but being here, seeing you feels right. To me, also, Leonardo. You four are welcome here always. That's kind of what our Master Splinter said to us about them. (sighs) I know. I'm worried about him, too. (loud groan) (whimpering) What is this? I asked for the Turtles, and you bring me back their... rat?! We became separated when their lair collapsed around us. But rest assured, Master, as long as you have the rodent... (groaning) the Turtles will come to you. Father, what is this all about? The Turtles. For my plans to proceed, I must have them. You have done well, Hun. Now... let us make ourselves easier to find. (high-pitched whirring) The time has come to rise! (phone ringing) They're still not answering. I'm telling you, Casey, something's wrong. Ah, I'm sure they're fine, April. I mean, take a look around. It's a beautiful night. Everything's peachy. (rumbling) Huh? Huh? (loud rumbling, panicked yelling and screaming) (screaming) (tires screeching) (yelling) (hissing) What I said about peachy? Never mind. (yells) Okay, guys, here's everything we'll need to take down the Technodrome. Exploding throwing stars, anti-Technodrome roller skates, SPF 1000 sun block. And I got the pizzas. We're good to go. (laughing) You're joking, right? We came all the way to Wacky World for this junk? No! No! No! No! No! No! no! Now let's open up a portal back into your world and go kick Shredder's butt! (zapping) (weapons firing on-screen) What the shell?! (weapons firing, panicked screaming) (deep humming) Is that the Technodrome? Dudes, I don't think exploding throwing stars are gonna cut it this time! Then maybe it's time we bust out two of our baddest rides! (beep, engine starting) (air hissing, creaking) What? Your clown car's in the shop? (weapons firing) (crowd yelling) Move it! Move it! Double time! (explosive booming) (deep humming) (deep clanking) (high-pitched whirring) (electrical hissing) (screaming and yelling) (evil laughter) Did they really believe their military could stop this Technodrome? Fools! He's quite good there. Shh! I don't want to miss anything. My onslaught has only just begun! (growling) (panicked screaming) (roaring) (weapons firing) (yelling) (whooshing) (gasps) (pulsating whirring) 1988 TURTLES: Cowabunga! Crud! Why did Casey have to see us in this stupid van? The technical term is stupid party wagon. Could be worse, Raph. This is the lamest vehicle in the history of lame vehicles. Can't this thing go any faster?! (screams, grunts) Sure. But, uh, I wouldn't recommend it. Why not? Easier just to show you, dude. (yelps) (yelling) Cowabunga! (growling) (both banging vehicle) Ugh. (whimpers) You know, this wagon isn't half bad. It ain't half good either. (roaring) We're just tickling these uglies. We need... air support! (1988 MICHELANGELO whimpering) (screaming) (yelling) Whoa! Well, they say any landing you can walk away... Return of the noogies. Return of the noogies. MICHELANGELO: Cut it out! Come on. Let's end this once and for all. THE SHREDDER: Yes, come to me, Turtles. What the devil are you waiting for? They're right in your crosshairs. Destroy them already. (gasps) (whimpering) Restrain these buffoons. (both groaning) Sorry, boss. 1988 SHREDDER: Unhand me! KRANG: You'll hear from my transdimensional attorney! (tires squealing) Hey, they rolled out the welcome mat. Then how come I ain't feeling welcome? (laughing) You don't understand. The Utrom Shredder isn't like your Shredder. He's vicious. Lethal. Competent! We go in, no saying if we come out. Let's do this. Today, we're more than allies. We're brothers. ALL: Go, Green Machine! ALL: It's Ninja time! Turtle power! (grunts) Annoying power. Hey! RAPHAEL: Move it, half-shell. 1988 MICHELANGELO: Quit shoving! THE SHREDDER: Turtles. Thank you for accepting my humble invitation. (yelling) Thought you said he was tough. My sons, it is a trap. TURTLES: Huh? If there is one constant in the multiverse, it is the predictability of you Turtles. Threaten something you hold dear, and you will ignore your better instincts. You should have stayed away. (beep) (electronic whirring) Now, shall we begin? (electrical crackling) (yelling) (groans) (Turtles yelling) If you plan on doing us in, there's got to be an easier way. Oh, you shall perish, but not yet. You see, like you, I recently learned that ours is but a single dimension in a multiverse of dimensions. Intrigued, I used this very portal to survey them all. Which is when I made a startling, horrible discovery. There are not simply eight of you, but scores of you. Behold! A multiverse of accursed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. 1988 TURTLES: Awesome! Destroying the eight of you would accomplish nothing. So long as Ninja Turtles exist somewhere in the multiverse, they will interfere in the plans of the Shredder. Our epic battle is never going to end unless I put an end to Turtles forever! Even a creature as power-mad as you cannot believe he has the ability to subvert the entire multiverse. Let us put that to a test, vermin. It seems that like branches hanging off a single tree, each of these dimensions sprang from a common source. Destroy the source and you would set off a chain reaction that would destroy Ninja Turtles everywhere-- forever more. (gasps) And so, you are being scanned. Broken down for the sole purpose of discovering your source DNA. Two Turtle teams from two Turtle worlds. Different in so many ways, but deep down, there are similarities. (screaming) And those similarities shall point the path to the source dimension-- (yelling) Turtle Prime. (yelling) (electrical crackling) I only regret you will not survive to witness the end of your... KARAI: Father. We are receiving alarming and unstable energy readings. What is going on...? (Turtles screaming) (electrical crackling) No! Things like this never happened back home. COMPUTER: Turtle Prime located. THE SHREDDER: It works. The transdimensional portal is receiving the coordinates now. Farewell, Turtles! (gasps) (beeping) (evil laughter) (Turtles yelling) (yelling stops) No! Their demise is only the beginning. (beep) (zapping) That giant armored bowling ball just imploded. Casey, we've won. Won? April, no ship. No Turtles. Oh! They went into that thing, and now they're... they're... (groans) (whooshing) (gasps) (zapping) (yelling) (Turtles grunting and groaning) APRIL: Guys, you're alive! Dudes, like, what just happened? Yeah. Shouldn't we be, like, nonexistent right about now? APRIL: Mikey! And... Mikey? I bump my head, or am I really seeing double? DONATELLO: Casey, April, meet our dimensional duplicates. We ain't got time for no meet-and-greet. Raph's right. The Shredder's back, and he's on his way to destroy the source of all Ninja Turtle life. What?! Come again? If we don't stop it, it could spell the end of Ninja Turtles everywhere-- forever. (tires squealing) (snarling) (roaring) So, I still don't get it. Which Shredder is back, doing what? To who? What I want to know is, how did we survive the Shredder's centrifugal scanning process? We should have been broken down into nonexistence. Something didn't go according to his plan. Then he won't be expecting us to go after him. We need to head to the source dimension-- to what the Shredder called Turtle Prime. But, Leo, you saw Shredder's slide show. The turtleverse is like, ginormous. We have no way of knowing which dimension Turtle Prime is. We'd just be guessing. (all sighing) Or we could track your Shredder's exact movements instead. When the Technodrome phases through transdimensional barriers, it leaves a trail of particle emissions that, with the right equipment, we can recalibrate the portal stick to track. (tires squealing) (yelling) What the shell, Raph?! End of the road, bros. Literally! (people screaming) (horrified screaming) It's like the whole world's being erased. It's the Shredder-- has to be. He's reached Turtle Prime. APRIL: Then we'd better recalibrate your tracking device. You said you needed some equipment? All our gear was destroyed along with our lair. But I think I know a place that just might have the tech we need. DONATELLO: Come on! 1988 DONATELLO: Purple Dragon headquarters. Nice call, Mr. Wizard. I figured the Purple Dragons would still have the goods from that robbery they pulled. Yeah, without Hun, the Dragons ain't too swift. (fierce hissing) Step on it, home slices. This place bugs me out. (whimpering) Yes. (gasps) Mutation-- it's a real horror show. (yelling) I don't know how you escaped the Shredder, and I don't care. You're all mine now. Hun. Hon? Hon? Hun. Do you know the thing I hate most in all the world? Turtles! (roaring) (yelling) Alley-oop. Now I look in the mirror-- all I see is you. And I hate you even more! Hun, you don't understand-- The Shredder, he... Forget the Shredder. You're going to pay for what you've done to me. Some people just can't handle change. Why do you keep doing that? (whimpering) Who are you talking to? There's no one there. You idiot. There ain't gonna be anybody anywhere soon. Look! (yelling) Boss, what's happening to...? (screaming) 1988 MICHELANGELO: The whole world is going bye-bye, dude. Pretty soon you'll be going, too. No. We need your gear to track him, Hun. To stop him. (yelling) Hurry, take it! Stop him! Stop the Shredder before he... (screaming) (screaming stops) You heard the man. Let's go stop the Shredder. (whooshing) DONATELLO: Hurry! We need to get back to where we started. The exact spot the Technodrome left our dimension. Big smoking crater? Hard to miss. 1988 MICHELANGELO: Unless it disappears before we get there. (screaming) No! Casey! It's happening to me! April! Guys, April... She... she's disappeared! No! Casey! Raph, we can't stop. We have to keep moving. Right here. (grunting) Just have to reroute the dimensional phase converter. The rabbit goes up the hole, around the tree and back down the hole. Step on it, dudes. We're facing total, complete wipeout here. DONATELLO: Boost the particle signal gain. We're too cool to go! We're too cool to go! And power up. (wavering tones) (converter slows to a stop) But, but... But? But? But? But? It's not working. (bangs converter) (steady tone droning) (droning stops) (zapping) (wind whistling) The particle emissions end here. So this must be the place. Turtle Prime. (thunder crashing) Like what kind of world is this? Grim, gritty-- my kind of place. Figures. Figures. Figures. Figures. Huh. I'm thinking of retiring here. We'll all be retiring here permanently if we don't find the Shredder and stop him. Uh, Leo, I think someone just found us. (thunder crashing) Source dimension-- source turtles! (all gasping) What is this, eight wannabes? On our turf? Trying to steal our act? (grunts) Yeah. (all yelling) (all gasp) 1984 LEONARDO: I strike two on my way down. Donatello takes out a third with his staff. Already the pudgy ones are starting to panic. Raph loves this stuff. He's not alone. Why is he narrating? Is he crazy? Hardcore crazy. I love these guys. Ha! (grunts) (chuckles) Stop! (grunts) We're trying to save you from the... from the Shredder! (gasps) The Shredder? What do you know of the Shredder? We sworn to terminate the Shredder to avenge Master Yoshi. Terminate with extreme prejudice. (growls) (all whimpering) It's not your Shredder you need to worry about. Well, not right now. It's complicated. It's our Shredder; he's come here to tear down your world. And he's a grade-A meanie. ALL: Huh. So you're supposed to be us from other worlds? I don't see it. What's with the multi-colored headbands? (all gasp) Hmm, sellouts. Uh, well, check out the initialized belt buckles on these yahoos. Hey! Hey! Hey! How lame can a turtle get? Am I right? Hey! Ow! (laughing) Geez, what a hard case. What? Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing. All right, let's go stop your Shredder. You say he's using a Technodrome? Yep. But don't worry, we've created a sophisticated device that will be able to track the Technodrome no matter where... Is that it? (electrical crackling) Yep, that would be it. It's been doing that all night. Huh. Now let's go do something about it. (zapping) Behold the glorious destruction of a universe. And with it, the end of the Ninja Turtles. (evil laughter) Shredder, we are here! Shredder, face us. Ah, the prototypical Turtles. At last. Now with the flick of a switch-- it ends. Shredder! Do you fear us? (1984 Shredder laughing) I am here. (thunder crashing) Come and face your... (sputtering) (screaming) (body thuds) (cat yowls) Shredder! (thunder crashing) THE SHREDDER: You speak my name, but you do not know me. I am Ch'rell, Oroku Sake, Duke Accureds-- the one true Shredder. I am a destroyer of worlds and I fear no one! Told you he'd take the bait. (yelling) If there's one constant in the mulitverse, it's the Shredder's big, fat ego. Still alive? How can this be? Unless... (thunder crashing) Karai... you! Yes, Father. I used the matter transporter to rescue the Turtles from your scanner. And that's not all. Today my sons do not fight alone. (gasps) Uh-oh, we is so gonna get yelled at for this. (both sobbing) KARAI: Your unreasoning hatred of the Turtles has blinded you to the truth, Father. Your actions could destroy us all. (electrical crackling) Karai's right. Whatever you're doing, you've already wiped out our entire world. Fool. I care nothing for the universe I left behind. I will not stop until... (screaming) Less talk, more action. (loud rattling) (all gasping) Let us finish this once and for all. I came to this dimension to destroy Turtles. The more... ...the merrier! Now come, come and face your doom! All too easy. My new body gives me unlimited power. (evil laughter) (loud belch) You're not the only one with a molecular amplification bio suit, you know. (grunts) (fierce grunt) (groans) But mine actually works. (stifling belch) (loud belch) ALL: Ew! THE SHREDDER: Today is the end of days for you, Turtles. You and all who stand with you. (electronic hum) Look out! (weapons firing) (grunting) (metal clanging) 1988 SPLINTER: Look out! What do we do? It's no use. He's just too strong. 1988 MICHELANGELO: Tell me about it. (1988 Michelangelo grunting) Even trash cans have no effect. Oh, brother. Look out! (1988 Turtles sobbing) Yeah, okay, it's okay. You can let go now. Let go. (whimpering) Don't make me hurt you. Hey, anybody seen the Turtle's classics? (growling) (yelling) (electrical buzzing) (The Shredder screaming) (both groan) We're free. We're free. (yelling) (electrical buzzing) Looks like we just found something he's vulnerable to. Yeah-- Turtles. The Technodrome. Hmm, go figure. Get him into that beam! (Turtles grunting) We got to save the master. We got to save the master. Oh! (electrical buzzing stops) (evil laughter) You had your chance. Now I have mine. Hey! Without these Turtles, you cannot exist. Behold! (yelling) (yelling and screaming) Only now, in the end, do you truly understand. (screaming in agony) (evil laughter) (explosion) (screaming) (groans) Exploding throwing stars. Told you they'd come in handy. (evil laughter) Fools, your pathetic little toys are not enough to stop me. I will... (screaming) (electrical buzzing) Whew! That was an easy fix. The master will be pleased. (screaming) No! No! No! I will not... I am... (screaming): No!! (laughing) The Shredder has been shredded. 1988 DONATELLO: I'd say Turtle Prime is healing up rather nicely. It seems the dimensional damage was only temporary, so long as Turtle Prime survived. Which hopefully means... Our world is healing, too? I know a fun way to find out. 1988 MICHELANGELO: Casey! 1988 DONATELLO: April! (1988 Turtles smooching loudly) (laughing) All right, all right, show's over, you goofballs. 1988 TURTLES: I wuv you, Casey. I wuv you, April. What is wrong with them? Leonardo, seriously, for your own good, you bros should lay off the dimension hopping business. It's dangerous. Bros? We're bros. (all gasping) Now that's what I call a Ninja vanish. What about your Shredder? Think he's really gone for good this time? The Shredder is seldom gone for long. He shall return. Well, when I get back I'm going to zap you all with the giggle ray Krang invented. (laughs) And rest assured, it will be us who get the last laugh. (loud belch) Excuse me. Hey, take us with ya. We said we was sorry. Take care of yourselves, my brothers. See you around the multiverse, bros. ALL: It's Ninja time! ALL: Turtle power! (electronic whooshing) I'm gonna miss those pudge-balls. Not. (electronic zapping) I'm gonna miss those wannabes. Yeah, I kind of dug the initials on the belt buckles. Huh, you would. I could go for a slice, though. There's that place on Bleeker. We are the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. We strike hard and fade away into the night. PETE: I think this first issue is coming along rather well, don't you, Kev? KEVIN: Yeah, sure do, Pete. Hey, let's get back to this after lunch, huh? Hmm, sounds good. Pizza? Yeah, pizza. Oh, I sure hope this thing sells. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing.
