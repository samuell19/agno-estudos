(soft chiming music) (fly buzzing) (fly splattering) (water dripping) (music box clicking) (cheerful music box music) (suspenseful music) (water splashing softly) (suspenseful music) (water splashing softly) (door creaking) (dramatic crescendo) (thrilling music) (crickets chirping) - Let me call myself for the moment, William. I'm a storyteller by nature and a liar in my freer times. No part of what I convey is true, but every part is truthful. You will come to despise me and your revulsion will be rightly warranted, I swear it. Now, however, by way of staying execution and mitigating these accusations against me, I offer this sad history. (tense music) Most abhor my commitment to pretension and inconsistency, but I implore you, listen. Only then might you understand completel I hated the old man. It's not that he had wronged me or given insult. Those things I'd come to accept as a matter of course. I think it was his breath. (man breathing heavily) That shallow rasp of a man on the edge of a maelstrom. Too weak-spirited to indulge his nobler instincts. Desperately grasping within the darkness for deliverance from the inescapable and ever-present specter of death. I became terrified he'd find miraculous salvation, shake the noose once more, become somewhat his former self. And the whole miserable ordeal would begin again. (distant clock ticking) (crickets chirping) (loud banging) (water splashing) It is impossible to say how the idea first entered my brain, but once conceived, it possessed me. (man breathing heavily) (door creaking) (suspenseful music) But I'm getting ahead of myself. Before I continue, I must first impart my breathless impression of that singular element to the story that quickens my heart and awakens my better nature, assuming I have one. Let me lift your gaze to her. (solemn music) - Hi. I'm here to see Mr. Usher. (sphygmomanometer inflating) (solemn instrumental music) (pen scratching) He won't be needing the blood thinners or the chemo medication anymore. We'll be replacing those with the morphine drip. Now, keep this away from all the other injections. It's pretty strong stuff. And everything else just give to him as you normally would, okay? All right, now I need you to sign this. This just states that we went over everything and that you understand. Do you have any other questions? - When will he be going back to the oncologist? - He won't be going back to the doctor. I need you to understand that I'm not he to make him better. I'm here to make him comfortable. Did the two of you talk about this before you decided to-- - Yes. I'm sorry. It's just a lot to take in. - No, I understand. Take your time. - How long does he have? - A few months? - Will he get worse? - Yes. We'll give him some strong medicine to help with the pain, but I'm afraid it'll make him less lucid Of course, if you're having second thoughts about this, then the two of you should really talk about-- - No, thank you. I understand. The idea that my love for her in as much as I am capable of feeling such emotion would begin at our first moment of somber introduction is the substance of delusion. Still, I cannot with quiet conscience deny it. We set about the comfort of the old man and that alone we pursued with pious vigor. Never would our eyes meet or our pulses quicken at the sight of the other. Never would we smile or swoon or sigh. We would instead passionately declare the depths of the love which we both felt most assuredly, and as a matter of absolute certitude for the old man, and yet the sympathies of a scarcely-intelligible nature existed between us. We would find ourselves stealing away, always in the interest of respect for the old man, for no dutiful son or physician's assistant would discuss the tragedy of a man's absolute and incontrovertible death within 100 yards earshot of the hero himself. (man breathing heavily) (somber instrumental music) (music box clicking) (soft music box music) (lips smacking) Thanks for coming by. (shoes clacking) Then it was finished. - Hi, I'm here to see Mr. Usher. (dogs barking) - Where's Anna? - Oh, Anna cut back on some of her cases and I'm taking a few of her patients for her. Can I come in? (crickets chirping) (rotary phone clicking) (phone ringing) - [Anna] Hello? - Hey. I missed you today. Where were you? - [Anna] William, I'm sorry. I can't care for Mr. Usher at this time. - But he loved you, I mean-- - [Anna] I'm so sorry. I just don't think it would be appropriate. I hope you understand. - I don't. - [Anna] I'm sorry, William. I have to go. Give him my love, okay? I'm sorry. (phone receiver bangs) (William sighs) - And thus joy suddenly faded into horro and the most beautiful became the most hideous. (water splashing) I continued my endeavors of faithfulness, tending, with the help of the nameless nurse who scurried and busied herself as a soulless beast in preparation of his demise to the old man's every want and need and principle of arrogant, entitled desire. It was now that my hatred for him blossomed and bloomed as a cancer of thought and obsession. (vibrant violin music) He who through unholy fate brought us together and with some gleeful aspiration, I know not the particulars of how nor do I care, drove her from that accursed house of false modesty. I longed with the most earnest and consuming desire for the old man's decease. I refuse to deny it. (water splashing) But the obstinate spirit clung to its tenement of clay for many days, through many weeks and irksome months until my hatred obtained a mastery over my mind. And I grew furious through delay and with the heart of a fiend to curse the days and the hours and the bitter moments, which seemed to lengthen and lengthen as his despicable life declined like shadows in the dying of the day. (glass shattering) (clock ticking rapidly) (blood dripping) (soft music box music) (man snoring softly) (switch clicking) - [Mr. Usher] William. - I'm here. (door creaking) (tense violin music) (water splashing) There was not a singular moment when the task was decided. Instead, the fate of the old man unwound as a fable whose gruesome conclusion is both hideously unnecessary and fully predetermined. Once the plan had thus matured, over the course of weeks or months absolutely unknown to myself throughout the entirety of that period, it sprung fully-formed from my psyche. (tense violin music) (Mr. Usher snoring) I endeavored to do the deed. And so I did, that very same night. (door creaking) (Mr. Usher breathing heavily) (Mr. Usher breathing heavily) (loud breathing) (door creaking) (tense music) I prepared myself for the finality of the task. It was not my intention to allow the old man to pass all together peaceably. A wrong is unredressed when the avenger fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done the wrong. (tense violin music) For more than an hour I waited, listening the whole time to that raspy breath. (loud breathing) That terrible inhalation and exhalation stole my will and replaced it with a malice few have glimpsed and fewer can comprehend. (loud, raspy breathing) (distant clock ticking) (suspenseful music) And so I killed the old man. (dramatic music) (Mr. Usher choking) The slightest pressure to the throat allows the futility of hope to slip through with each hideous passing breath, while the morphine seals the inevitability of demise. I held him at the edge of the abyss for hours, days, or mere minutes. Time was a matter for other men. I could feel the torturous breath ebbing mercilessly from him and taste the panic seeping from his pores. Decades of wasted thoughts and fears, hopes and regrets descended violently on the man's soul, subduing his spirit. And in that moment, I forgave him completely. My own spirit lifted through the perverseness of the endeavor. Then all was silent and I was alone. (William cries) (rotary phone clicking) (phone ringing) - [Anna] Hello? - He's dead. - [Anna] I'm so sorry. - Will you come? Please? - Yes. (phone receiver rattles) (distant clock ticking) Have you contacted any of the other family members? - No. - That's okay, take your time. There's no rush with any of this. - Will there be an autopsy or an examination to find out what happened? - We know what happened. He was a very sick man. I don't see a reason to do an aut-- - I mean, there's no way to know for sure what happened, right? And no one else was here, and I, he was. He was banging on the wall and it was so loud, and I was angry. And he could... He could barely breathe. - William. - And it was just so awful. - William, William. Look at me. This isn't your fault, okay? You both knew this was going to happen. He died peacefully at home, in his bed, just like he wanted. (William cries) (somber music) (eerie music) (dramatic music) (somber music) - Beneficiaries of the estate will receive and share all of the property and assets not required for the payment of any debts owed. All property given under this will is subject to any encumbrances or liens attached to the property. I direct my executor to distribute the residue of my estate as follows. (distant clock ticking) (music box banging) (suspenseful music) (distant clock ticking) (suspenseful music) (clock ticking rapidly) - What do you want me to say? He made some mistakes. He was a piece of shit. - Don't say that. - He gave you nothing. You wiped his ass. You gave him food. He gave you nothing. - He... He had his reasons. - Yeah, he did. But he could have shown one little shred of-- - Pity? - Mercy. Fucking pride. You're a lot like him. Take it as a compliment. Listen, as far as I'm concerned, house is yours. - I don't want this fucking house. - He wouldn't want you to be homeless. - You think he'd care? - Just stay here as long as you want. I don't wanna see my little brother get kicked out on the street. (door slams) (tense music) (crickets chirping) - I never fully expected the old man to acknowledge my devotion. He was able somehow to see beneath my facade of concern and illuminate the insincerity of my emotion, even when I was myself incapable of doing so. The ever-present gaze of his consciousne stretched seemingly across eons and back to the moment of my absolute unapologetic betrayal. I can see now how such knowledge in defiance of all laws of causation informed his behavior towards me from the very moment of my birth. Such postulation and only that may explain his peculiar disdain for my existence, An antipathy my myopic mind could never quite grasp. Suffice it to say the old man never laid a hand on me, never abused me, barely scolded me. He'd expressed his displeasure not with words, which the old man rarely spoke in my direction, but by emanating a palpable air of frustration, which actively impressed upon me my general unwelcomeness, as well as my inability to ever generate a modicum of joy in his, or perhaps anyone's, life I have carried this with me, although I can understand its falseness upon recollection and analysis. The aura of this energy has seeped into the marrow of my bones, where it will lead me towards his same lonely and disinterested end. I would've borne the entirety of this insult with grit and grace, excepting the fact that he pointed it not just at myself, but at another. Just that singular breathing entity to whom I owe the entirety of my miserable existence. (somber music) Hers was a disposition of deepest melancholy, the sadness of a thinking woman. Nothing could have infuriated the old man more than such a creature whose depth, both intellect and emotion he could scarcely understand, even on his most affable days. His disdain for her queries, which were often rightly pointed squarely at the idiocy and futility of his scheming, coupled with a callous demeanor with which he met her most earnest pleas for patience and understanding drove me, I swear it, toward my intense and inevitable hatred. Drove him, I say, to his very own demise by my hand, for it was his being, his core state of unrelenting coldness, which ushered forward that hideous moment that would forever consume my life. (somber music) (door creaking) (ominous music) I did not return to that house. Nor did I allow myself to see the old ma for a number of years. But I confess, I took his money. I continued my studies at university and subsisted on the fruits of his tedious business dealings while simultaneously and openly mocking the content of his character for engaging in those very same endeavors. This hypocrisy became one of my few and deepest regrets. The vortex of thoughtless folly into which I so recklessly plunged washed away all but the froth of my past hours, engulfed at once every solid or serious impression and left memory only the various levitie of a former existence. (somber music) Two years passed. The wine flowed freely, and there were not wanting other and perhaps more dangerous seductions. (suspenseful music) (eerie rattling) (distant laughing) (light clicking) (eerie rattling) (suspenseful music) (eerie rattling) (man laughing melodramatically) (eerie rattling) (soft buzzing) (clock ticking rapidly) (soft music box music) (cheerful music box music) (door creaking) (cheerful music box music) (light switch clicking) (suspenseful music) (clock ticking rapidly) (suspenseful music) (door creaking softly) (door banging) In the weeks following the deed, I found little solace. My hideous act had served only to palsy the joy of fury and righteous indignation, but an action I concluded would've allowed these same phantoms to consume me entirely, a paradox too utterly monstrous for solution, I assure you. (phone ringing loudly) Hello? - [Anna] Hi, William. Can I see you? (bright music) (door chiming softly) William? - Hi. - How are you? - Good, you know, all thing's considered - May I? - Please. - So I... I wanted to meet so I could apologize in person. I did a really bad job of handling thing and I understand if you hate me. - I don't hate you. - I mean, I know I abandoned you in a really terrible time, and I swear, that's not how I wanted things to happen. It's just things between us, they were.. I just thought it would be best if I excluded myself from the equation for a little while. I mean, you already had enough going on, and I could tell that you were conflicted and vulnerable. And I didn't want you to feel like I was taking advantage. It was just really bad timing. Terrible timing. - I don't understand. - I mean, I thought that we... And then we kissed. - You thought there was something between us? - Well, yeah. - Oh. - Wasn't there? - I thought you were seeing someone. - Not that I know of. Well, I just wanted to meet so I could apologize. - Apology accepted. So I can call you now? (Anna chuckles softly) - Yes. Yes, you can call me now. - Never would I have dared entertain the remotest possibility of a resolution beyond the realm of macabre solitude. By what miracle I escaped destruction, it is impossible to say. At that moment, the truth, the tragedy of the drama was no more. In an instant and in every instant thereafter for a time, my sublime downfall was secured. For I loved her with a love more fervent than I believed it possible to feel for any denizen of the Earth. But here is where my incessant commentary must cease, for I have no words, alas, to tell the loveliness of loving well. (somber orchestral music) But I digress. Where were we? (playful orchestral music) The illness had shaken the old man to his foundation. He indulged as do we all the primitive belief that one's demise must be forever a vagu and distant prospect, a telegraphed end to a fully-lived life. But the avenues to death are numerous and strange, traversed at a dizzying and invisible velocity. And when he summon companionship in his hour of need, the same companionship he would deny even his own bride, I wanted nothing more than to abandon hi fully and without remorse, but I felt the air grow redolent with death's unquenchable thirst. It's oppressive weight took entire possession of my soul. So I chose without will or premeditation to conspire against it. Yeah. Okay. (soft music box music) (monitors beeping) - Are you ready, Mr. Usher? - Okay, Dad. See you soon. - I'm scared. - To the old man. May he rest in an overpriced box in the ground. (glasses clinking) - Don't speak ill of the dead. - Why not? They speak ill of us. - You're drunk. - And you love it. I'm finally opening up. (Anne chuckles) I'm not drunk, I'm pretending. The truth is I'm gonna miss the old man. I don't know why I'm gonna miss him. - But you loved him. I know you did. I could tell. - You wanna see my father terrified? Tell him you love him. Jesus fucking Christ, I can't even listen to myself. You wanna know the most profound thing that he ever said to me? I was about six or seven. He said, "I see so much of myself in you "that sometimes I can't even bear to look at you." And it made me feel so fucking good, proud that I was like him and proud that he couldn't stand me, all at the same same time. Look, this is all just grief, confusionable shit. So I would appreciate it if you just forgot said anything. I don't think it's very fair to hold this against me. But, secretly, I hope it endears you to me. Like, you know, I'm trying to use the death of my father to get in your pants, which is the exact same kind of thing that he would do. So maybe he was right all along. Except now I'm the one who can't bear to look myself in the face, and halfway through the speech, I lost track whether I was trying to open up to you or manipulate you to try to win your affection. I am either the most self-aware mother fucker in the world or the least. And sometimes it feels like there's no difference. You know that one thing I said, about how my father said I was like him, I don't even know if he actually said it or if I just saw it on some TV show and imagined he said it, but I thought it would win me some fucking points. So voila, it's part of my story now. And I have no fucking clue how real any any of it is. - You think you killed your father. (suspenseful music) - No. - [Anna] You didn't. - I know. (suspenseful music) A lie which follows a wild truth obscures itself entirely and without effort. I would've told her, but there are some secrets that do not let themselves be told. Men die nightly in their beds, ringing the hands of ghostly confessors and looking them piteously in the eyes. Die with despair of heart and convulsion of throat on account of the hideous mysteries, which will not suffer themselves to be revealed. (loud banging) (water splashing) (door creaking) (light switch clicking) (light switch clicking) (dramatic music) (William gasping) - William? William, William, it's okay. You're awake, it's okay. It's okay. It was only a dream. - [William] Only a dream. And if not? Ah, what world of mystery and meaning, doubt and uncertainty is there involved in those two letters? That mono-syllable. If. (light switch clicking) (door creaking) - [Doctor] Mr. Usher. - Successful surgery brought a bare modicum of hope immediately quashed by the test results that followed. No sooner had the old man heard of his impending doom than he adjusted his focus as always solely toward the business at hand. He immediately sold all earthly property most notably the home of my miserably-contented childhood, and consolidated his moderate wealth to a fund whose singular purpose became providing death in the most socially-accepted fashion. Modest furniture and all manner of medical necessity was delivered directly to a home particularly suited to the macabre occasion. The old man resigned, whether as repentance or misanthropic protestation to die alon He desired this, he assured me, as his one and only dying wish. No more than two brief days after relocation, he was taken ill, and seeing him feeble and frightened and pitying himself in that absurd pauper's bed, surrounded by nurses who flattered and fawned about, I determined to deny his request. (loud breathing) I'll stay. (loud breathing) (muffled chattering) - [Anna] William! - I'm, I'm sorry. What were you saying? - That I'm worried about you. - I can't imagine why. - What can I do? - You're doing it. - Good. Because I have to use the little girls' room, and I can't hold it any longer. (laughs) (door creaking) (gentle music) (door creaking) (light switch clicking) (William sighs) (dramatic music) (William gasping) William! William, William, what's going on? Hey. Are you okay? Yeah? Okay. - It was, I told her, a momentary lapse of faculties. The weight of that room, the influence of wine, the physical toll of my grief. I would be fine. I required sleep. I needed, I told her, to be alone with my thoughts. (tense music) (door creaking) (clock ticking) (sponge brushing) Distraction and distraction alone can ke at bay the senseless manifestations of nerves and anxiety. And so I threw myself fully towards such distraction, but my mind never strayed far from that accursed room. (door creaking) The desperate pounding. (loud banging) His hideous breath. (heavy breathing) The last waltz of fawn weather. (loud banging) - How's my favorite fuck up little brother today? How's work, social life? Met anyone special since we last talked? - What do you want? - Why are you always so hostile? We're brothers. Is it really so hard to believe that I actually love and care about you? Come on, sit down. I think we should get better at this, don't you? So I've been thinking, we've never really been close. I feel like I come from a whole other world than you really. And to be honest, it was never easy growing up as Dad's favorite. All the expectations and comparisons. I could never be the out there, fuck society, punk rock rebel. I had to do all of my counter-cultural growing up in secret. Honestly, I kinda hated you for it, but I figure, let bygones be bygones. Dad's six feet under, God rest him. Probably not. All we have left is each other, right? So how about this? Instead of going on some cheesy retreat or talking about our feelings, let's just fuck the same girl, preferably at the same time, and then compare notes. - Look. - Sit down! (tense music) Seriously, sit the fuck back down. I don't know what the fuck you think you're doing, playing up this whole grief-stricken little boy thing to get some pussy, but it's fucking sick You are fucking sick. You don't even know who she is. She has her own story. She's not here to serve yours. I understand you wanna be me so badly, you can even fool yourself into believing it's true, but it's not. This can't last. And whatever is going on between you two as some kind of fucked up revenge thing, it'll pass. And you'll end up alone, holding your dick in your hands, whining about how unlovable you are. Sound about right? So let's cut to the end. I want her out of your life. You end this now. If you don't, I will. It's your choice, brother. (suspenseful music) - His plain words presented without the frills and misdeeds of the poet unmasked a naked truth, one which would disarm and drive me perfectly and deeply into the maelstrom of my own mind. This can't last. (suspenseful music) (ominous music) That an earnest, mutual love burned within us, I cannot deny. How vainly had we flattered ourselves, feeling happy in its first up-springing, that our happiness would strengthen with its strength. As it grew, so grew in my heart the dread of that evil hour, which was hurrying I now knew to separate us forever. Every look, every gesture became an omen of inescapable doom. Thus in time it became painful to love. Hate would've been a mercy then. Each blissful moment we were together, I longed for wretched solitude. And so I gently curbed our association, desperate to postpone with absence the inevitable and fatal estrangement. It's here the threads of the narrative tapestry of my recollections begin to fray and unwind. Whether this can be blamed on the self-inflating nature of memory or the reality-bending will of ego, I cannot say, but the systems by which I lived my entire life revealed themselves as farce. It seemed now that motive followed actio just as cause precedes effect. (clock ticking loudly) (soft music box music) (door creaking) (cheerful music box music) (floor creaking softly) (bureau creaking) (suspenseful music) (cheerful music box music) (dramatic crescendo) (basement door creaking) (ladder clanking) (boot thumping) (footsteps thudding) (water dripping) (footsteps thudding) (light clicking) (ax scraping) (cheerful music box music) (dramatic music) (body thuds) (thrilling music) (William panting) (thrilling music) (distant clock ticking) (light switch clicking) (door creaking) (head banging) (loud banging) (door creaking) (light switch clicking) (loud banging) (music box music) (drill buzzing) (lock clicking) (footsteps pattering) In the weeks following, I endured three separate but equally recurring visions, often in tandem and always at the edge of waking thought They deprived all rest and withered my mind. I hold them without doubt directly responsible for the depraved events which followed. And I present them undefiled, thus. (somber music) (loud banging) (loud banging) (water splashing) (loud banging) (door creaking) (Mother coughing) (somber music) (loud banging) (Mother choking) (Mother choking) (eerie rattling) - Don't kill her again. (William gasping) (William panting) (William sighs) (soft music box music) (cheerful music box music) (distant clock ticking) (cheerful music box music) (dramatic crescendo) (distant clock ticking) (loud banging) (thrilling music) (loud banging) (loud banging) (loud banging) (loud banging) (loud banging) (loud banging) (jarring music) (lock clicks) (suspenseful music) (mysterious whispering) (suspenseful music) (thrilling music) (dramatic music) (mysterious buzzing) (thrilling, jarring music) (dramatic, shrill music) (water dripping) (handcuffs jangling) (William whimpering softly) (handcuffs jangling) (William screams) (William cries) (thrilling, jarring music) (William breathing heavily) (clock ticking rapidly) (suspenseful music) (water splashing) (suspenseful music) (light switch clicking) (light switch clicking) (phone ringing) Hello? - [Anna] Hi, William. Can I see you? - Alas, we have fallen on our most evil of evil days. (glass sliding) - How are you? - I'm fine. - William, what's going on? You're really not gonna talk to me? William, we have to talk. I've seen you, what? Once in the past three weeks? I know you're going through some stuff, but it's time to move on. (tense music) I'm sorry. I just can't be with you. Do you hear what I'm saying? I can't live like this. I just don't know what else to do. (dramatic music) (mysterious whispering) (eerie creaking) I think it's best for both of us if I never see you again. (thrilling music) William, it's time to let go. (hammer squelches) (Anna gasping softly) (body thuds) (somber music) - I did not want her dead. That in the end is why she died. I reached out and touched her warm cheek her bloodied hair. And I pressed down her pallid eyelids with passionate fingers of love. What knowledge I found in that moment. What accurate regret and longing. What truth, beautiful and saccharine and fleeting. (tense music) (cheerful music box music) (basement door creaking) (body dragging) (footsteps thudding) (somber music) (sheet rustling) (sponge scrubbing) (toothbrush scratching) (mouth spitting) (dramatic crescendo) (crickets chirping) (William breathing deeply) (water dripping) (basement door creaking) I knew then that I'd never really loved her. In the strange anomaly of my existence, feelings with me had never been of the heart. And my passions always were of the mind. (bell tolling) A mind whose ringing obsession grew amplified by the harsh daylight of waking hours, which illuminates with indifference the severity of deeds and the inescapable conclusion that must invariably be drawn. All is madness. (clock ticking rapidly) But day must submit to the cool irrationality of night. As my tumultuous mind must submit to the softness of earth. And the embrace of my Anna. (thrilling violin music) Then by daylight return of the blinding pall of self-examination, self-pity, and the sickness of regret. (clock ticking rapidly) And of the desire to simply not be. (thrilling violin music) It was macabre routine. (William whimpers) A pestilential cycle of doubt and assurance, hatred and love, perdition and paradise. (William whimpers) (lock clicks) (William whimpering) (lock clicking) I became insane. With long intervals of horrible sanity. (ominous music) The specters that had elicited in me feelings more intense than terror for which there is no name upon the earth became a constant, and I, in shroud of false apathy, became the haunting force of endless empty rooms. They belonged now only to the dead. (eerie wailing) All around were horror and thick gloom, and a black sweltering desert of ebony. (basement door creaking) Her sepulcher, our tomb, became a place to set off the mind and liberate it from the weight of the waking world. It is happiness to wonder. It is happiness to dream. Such a dream became the business of my life. I existed solely to wade into placid memories of our unending partnership full and complete, and without the hindrances of social expectation, impending loss or reality. (suspenseful music) Anna and I loved with a love that was more than love. A love of which my waking self was most assuredly incapable. (mysterious whispering) We shared the life that should have been Until the sun in the East and the doubt in my mind rose up and whispered in a cruel wrath, "All you love, you love alone." (loud banging) - Where is she? - [William] I don't understand. - Don't fucking play games with me. Where the hell is Anna? I know you know, you little shit, so tell me where she is. - She doesn't wanna see you. - She's here? (clock ticking rapidly) (tense music) Anna? Anna, are you in here? - She hasn't been acting like herself, okay? - [Wilson] How do you mean? - She's been hearing things, seeing things. Paranoia, I just... Just wondered if you wanted to help her, you know? - So where is she? - She really doesn't wanna talk to you. Let me talk with her, alone. Look, I'm in over my head. I know that I'm in over my head, but just let me talk to her. Let me convince her. Come back tonight at 10. I'll make sure she's here. Let me do this, okay? (suspenseful music) (water dripping) I would not let him have her. (lips smacking) (suspenseful music) (sheet rustling) (vibrant violin music) (drill buzzing) The usefulness of indignation is a curious thing. A single dismissive act can turn the most self-loathing towards righteousness, and replace the most fervent malaise with absolute motivation. I despised and pitied myself, true, but he too despised and pitied me. And for that, I would be avenged. I turned once again to those tenets that had driven me to this madness. System, logic, method. Yes, method is the thing. There is a brilliance in method, in routine and reliability, that borders on genius. And yet, it is not. Genius is always going off at some tange of ridiculous speculation, but I found it necessary to keep my eyes downcast and focus on the business at hand. It was my intention now to put my scheme into operation. And I resolved to make him feel the whole extent of the malice with which I was imbued. (vibrant violin music) I knew then that I was not long for this world, but also that the modicum of time left to me would be overflowing with that panacea, which invigorates even the most wretched of souls. Purpose. (hand banging) Come in, dear brother. Can I get your drink? I have a very fine bottle of dry sherry open. - Where is she? - All in due time. Sit, relax. - Are you drunk? - Absolutely not. Why, I'm barely this side of tipsy. Here we are. Let's have a toast. - I'm not in the mood. - Oh, but you will be, dear brother. I swear it. Come on, have a drink with me. Just one. (glass shatters) Whiskey, then? - Stop fucking around. - You knock a 22-year-old glass of Amontillado out of my hands in a fit of jealous rage and ask me to stop fucking around? (laughs) Now, I'm going to fetch you another glas and you are going to summon the courage to apologize. And then we'll toast to your good fortun - What good fortune? - It seems, dear brother, that you have won the heart of our maiden fair. I've talked with her and she most definitely and without hesitation, wants you back. - She said that? - I'd like to take credit for this turn of events, but I must admit I had little to do with it. Scarcely had I mentioned your visit, and the poor girl fell to her knees with tears in her eyes and professed her undying love for you. "I knew he loved me. "I knew he cared," and so forth and so o So congratulations is in order, for you at least. - William, I'm sorry. - Yes, but not sorry enough, I'm sure, to refuse the lady's advances. A congratulations and a toast is in orde Under the circumstances, I'm sure you can understand my insistenc I refuse to drink alone. Bottoms up. (glasses clinking) - Where is she? - You haven't said anything about the house. - What? - How it looks. - It looks fine. - Well, I couldn't have you think badly of me. I couldn't live with myself if you thought badly of me, dear brother. - William, where is she? - She's in the cellar, if you believe that. I said she wanted you back. I did not say that she had all of her faculties. She calls it her hideout, says it makes her feel safe. She sleeps down there. Sometimes I sleep with her. Just sleep, mind you, not that I want much more. Hygiene issues. (chuckles) You really know how to pick 'em, big brother. - Let's go see her then. - Finish your drink, you'll be glad you did. (basement door creaking) (steps clanging) - [Wilson] What the hell is down here? - [William] The love of our lives, dear brother. Dear brother. Whew. - You all right, little brother? - Oh, that you should be so lucky, sir, to be rid of me in such a neat and tidy fashion. - Don't say things like that. - Oh, I think I will. I think I'll say exactly what I mean to say to you, right now. - So where is she? - Oh, I'm sure she's around here somewhere. Anna? My darling, Anna, dearest friend and confidante. - She's not down here? - Oh, I'm sure she is. Why don't you have a look? (hand patting) Anna? - [Wilson] Anna? - [William] Anna. - [Wilson] What the fuck is that? - Oh. (hands clap) Good job, brother. I think you found her. (light clicks) - What? - Say hello, dear brother. Say hello to the love of your life. I said say hello! (dramatic music) Tell her you love her, dear brother. She's here for you. She only wants you. Doesn't that make you happy? She's coming for you. She's coming to make you her groom. (laughs) (ladder rattles) (Wilson groans) (head bangs) There the traveler meets, aghast, sheeted memories of the past. (trowel scraping) (Wilson groans softly) (handcuffs jangling) (muffled shouting) Welcome back to the living. Though I must admit, you find yourself in a predicament. (muffled shouting) I'll spare you the tedium of explanation but I will say this. Everything you see around you, every inference your sluggish mind will make, is exactly as you perceive it. I'll give you a moment. (muffled shouting) (handcuffs jangling) (trowel scraping) (muffled groaning) (handcuffs rattling) (muffled shouting) You seem to take matters easily. I really wonder at your patience under the circumstances. (muffled shouting) But in truth, I am in no degree to blame Instead, I would hope, though I know it seems an unreasonable request, for your gratitude Horror and fatality have been stalking abroad in all ages. And yet, for the next few moments, should you choose to accept a noble end, I have freed you from all manner of fear Do you follow? I hope you do. I mean to say, how can you fear that which is already upon you? (trowel scraping) You need no longer be concerned with the proprieties of space or of time. (chuckles) You're free, brother. Free to contemplate, to analyze, to understand, to see with a fullness of vision your own ending. Now I dare not deign to tell you your business or your meaning, but I will leave you with this one suggestion to ponder. Nothing you have ever done, nothing you've ever said or thought or written means anything. (Wilson laughs) (William laughs) Have you gone mad so quickly, dear brother? Or do you just choose to die laughing? Which must be the most glorious of all glorious deaths. (Wilson laughs) (eerie laughing) (Wilson laughs) (dramatic music) (floor creaking softly) (door creaking) (distant screaming) (suspenseful music) (blood pouring) (loud banging) (suspenseful music) (loud banging) (distant laughing) (suspenseful music) (loud banging) (thrilling music) Let me call myself for the moment, William. (suspenseful violin music) I'm a storyteller by nature. I'm a liar in my freer times. (suspenseful violin music) (Mr. Usher breathing heavily) (William cries) - I direct my executor to distribute the residue of my estate as follows. All assets, possessions and property to my only son, William Wilson Usher. (suspenseful violin music) - William, we have to talk. I love you and I'm here for you, but this is too much for me. It's time to get some help. I'm sorry. I just can't be the support you need right now. If you want me to be with you, you have to talk to somebody. William, you're seeing things that aren't there, talking to people who aren't real. I can't live like this. I want to help. Can you hear me? I just don't know what else to do. I think it's best for both of us if you get help now, before you get worse and cut me off, and I never see you again. William, it's time to let go of that guilt. (hammer squelching) - No part of what I convey is true, but every part is truthful. I offer now this sad and amended history (gentle music) (somber orchestral music) It was not my hand that stayed her breat That is what I would have you believe, if you will, the melancholy tale in which I choose to reside my truth, inasmuch as truth has any bearing on the present circumstance. Though it does make the tale nice and neat and pretty, as do most lies of narrative. But for you, my lowly audience, I fear a resolution will be abrupt. And inconclusive. For the value of a good tale lies not in its denouement, but in its serpentine unwieldy unfolding More than that, I've grown tired and feeble and cold. There's a tickle in my throat, and my breath has become my fear. A short rasp of its former self. (crickets chirping) (match striking) (flame hissing) (mysterious whispering) (match clanks) (thrilling music) (suspenseful violin music)
