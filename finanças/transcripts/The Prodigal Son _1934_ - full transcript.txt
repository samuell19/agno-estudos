I want to sit like this forever, Tonio. You think? I'd like that, too. Can't find your tobacco pouch, right? Damned, I forgot it. In the forest, or somewhere at work. You know what it's like. Look, I finished this one yesterday. I'll give it to you. Want it? Want? It's the third one you knitted for me. Well done. I'll say: thank you! Will you leave it somewhere, too? In the forest? No! I'm keeping it as a souvenir! I won't lose it, you can trust me. - No, no! I'd love to make a new one for you. I'll start making the fourth tonight. I have to go see the woodcutters later. - So I won't see you later. No! I'll visit the teacher this evening. - Ah! Having one of your smart geography lessons again? Well, the teacher's alright! At least you can learn something about the world out there from him. I really need to go now, Barbl. - You need to go? - Yes. Hello Men! - It's Tonio! - Hello Tonio!

Strike right! Strike left! Strike right! Hey! What about work? Don't look like that! It was only Barbl, one can still look at her, right? She's not your concern, understand? Oho! We'll see about that. Yes! Alright! Are you satisfied now? - Thanks. Your face is glowing today. Have you seen something nice? - Maybe, father. Where have you been? At the summit cross. - That's a nice view. Have you been there by yourself? At first. - And later? Later I wasn't alone anymore. - Some nice fellow? - Yes. Who was it? Someone else entirely. Great! Hey! Alright! Good day, Father! How far did you get with your work? - Well, well, the boy. Are you finished in the forest? Yes, we finished a little early because it's Saturday. There are just a few pieces left here.. I'll finish soon. Go home and rest. - Alright. Let me finish. - Yes, I'm tired. Gee up! Where are we going today? Last time we were here, in Africa, with the blacks. Maybe across the ocean for once! - Ah! To America, to a big city! We're going to America, look. Across the sea, past the Azores.. And we arrive here, and get out here.. In Canada, with the Indians. - Yes, yes! Canada really belongs to England, you know. It's a country which spans 9 million square kilometers. Yes! - So it's twenty times larger than Germany. Damned, this would be a country to my liking. But it doesn't have more inhabitants than Bavaria. And the climate, you know, It's almost like.. - Look! I've got it! - What have you got? New York, biggest city in the world! You idiot, New York is not situated in Canada! I don't care, it's in America! Once I want to go see the world, cross the ocean.. To see a ship and big city! Damned! - Yes, yes. Who should be so lucky. God, I imagine living in a city must be a hundred times more beautiful.. Than here. - You think? - Between the mountains you live like.. ...a caged fox. - You want to leave the mountains? - Yes! I already saved some money. And... Let me tell you something... I don't like the mountains anymore. - I don't believe you! You can't wait for winter to arrive! I've seen you prepare your skis yesterday. - Well, the skis! That's something entirely different! We're running as a team at the race. Ah! - So we have to train in good time! So we won't shame ourselves! Have you got some good fellows? My oh my! The special price for the best German achivement in downhill and slalom.. Donated by the American Mr. Austin Douglas Williams... Goes to our comrades of the ski club Schneeberg.. Tonio Feuersinger... J?rg Radebitter and Thomas Walch. A triple "Ski Heil" to our comrades of the ski club! Bravo, Tonio!

Are you happy we won? And how! It's so nice here. Look, he's dancing with the American! None of your business. - She seems nice. Probably she's very rich. - Also none of your business. You speak English? Yes, a little. Not that much. - Fine! I want to go on a tour with you. Can you ski? - Yes. - Fine. - A little. The Weisshorn is difficult, we'll need a second guide. Really? - It has never been done before during winter, that's a first ascent. First ascent? Terrific! If I tell that to my friends from NY, they'll be astonished. Well, first we've got to get up there. We'll ascend the Weisshorn tomorrow. She hired me while we were dancing. The Weisshorn on her first day? - Yes. - I don't understand you. That's no big deal, I've been guiding a lot of difficult tours. Maybe you don't trust me? - Well, I do trust you. But you're taking it too lightly. No. I'm not going alone with her. I'm taking J?rg as as second guide. - Ha, him! - Yes! He's even more reckless than you are. - Reckless? Have I ever been reckless? Why are you sitting there? Let's dance again, tomorrow, we'll go up! Get lost J?rg, I'm dancing with her now! Right? Yes. - Come on! That's beautiful, very beautiful. What's this? It's the large golden sun mask. - Ah. Wonderful. Marvellous. I'll buy it for my daughter Lilian. Oh, she's going to love it. How much? - It can't be sold. It has been in our community for generations. It's not mine, it belongs to the Rauhnacht (carnival). Rauhnacht. What's Rauhnacht? - Rauhnacht? Rauhnacht is a huge celebration. During Rauhnacht, all the spirits rise. The Forest, the Field... The Meadow... The Fire and the Wind. All of them are worshipping the Sun God that night. Wonderful. And in the last the Sun King chooses.. His bride from the 12 Rauhnacht girls. - Very nice. Who's going to be Rauhnacht king next year? I'm so happy! I'll be allowed to take part, right? - Take it slow. We'll see if you're allowed to take part. Oh, it's very interesting, very interesting. I have a proposition for you. Carve an exact copy.. Of this sun mask for me, and I'll pay you.. 100 Dollars. - What? That's alright? - Yes, of course. And I'll even gold-plate it for you. Come in. Hello everybody! Hello Barbl! Good day! - Good day, what do you want? We're here to pick up the sun mask. - Do you know where to take it? Yes, like it has been decided. - Take it and watch out for it.. So nothing happens to it. - No. Good day! - Good day Barbl! They're taking the sun mask to the new king. Tonio is the Sun King. And this one stays with you. The next Rauhnacht will be at your farm and you're the host. It has been decided. - Yes. - That's fine. I'm giving you my word for Tonio. You have to cherish your fathers' customs. - Good day. - Good day. Good day men. Ah Tonio, Tonio! - J?rg! Help! - Stop, Stop! No! Good day, Barbl. Well? What's the matter? You're so quiet today. I want to tell you something, Mr Teacher. Something important? - Yes. Sit down and tell me. Hello! J?rg! Are you there? Ah! Are you in pain? Where are we? Where's J?rg? J?rg.. Stay here, I'll be right back. Dead. Poor J?rg. What about J?rg? He's dead. Oh God! Let him go see the world. There's an old saying, do you know it? No. - Remember it, it goes like this: "He who never leaves, never returns". I don't know. I'm so afraid. I think Tonio will never come home. I can't believe we're still alive. We're alive. But J?rg, the poor devil.. He bit the dust. My god! Let's go! I don't like the damned mountains anymore! How do you do? I would like to see Mr. Williams. I'm sorry sir, Mr. Williams is away for the winter. Away? When do you expect him back? - It's hard to say, sir. Well, thanks. I'll call again. - Alright, sir.

Is something the matter? - No. Do you miss Toni? He forgot about you. He married the American. That's not true. - Yes! You can hear a lot of stories at the shop. Do you think I don't know he doesn't write to you anymore? I also would have like for him to.. Stay home and help me with my work. I thought that back then. Back then, when he left. He betrayed us all. - Him? He betrayed his homeland! - Yes, that's true. Be quiet for once. What you say about him isn't true! Tonio is not a rascal. No! I didn't want to make her cry. No. I don't want to be a farmer's wife now. I gave my word to Tonio, and I'll keep it. Even if it will take a long time. That's a pity. I'm taking over my father's farm. I would have liked to marry you. You are such a nice girl. I like you a lot. - Think about it. I don't want to influence you too much, you know? There's nothing to think about, father.

Come on, let's go into the library. I don't think it's boring here. On the contrary. I think it's splendid. Your place is really beautiful. You don't get it.. You don't know a lot about women. Right? - Ah! That depends. Yeah, well. Do you remember what happened to us in the mountains a year ago? Yes. I wonder what's happening there now? Do you think you're going to stay with us? Possible. Don't you have a longing for Europe? No, I don't want to live there. I can understand that. Sometimes I feel an enormous longing for Europe. I think I wouldn't be able to live here Not even with me? What'd you say? If you couldn't live here with me? - Lilian! I love you. Father! Good day father! - Good day Tonio! - Hello!

The old man invites us, his son returned. I saw him myself. Hey! Long live the homeland! Everybody join me at the farm! Come on Tonio! - What is it? - Barbl isn't joining in. Where is she? - I don't know. She gave her Rauhnacht dress away. I'll look for her. Tell father I'll be right back. - Alright. I'm the forest.. I'm ancient.. I catch the storm I shackle the snow I build your huts I heat your stove Peasant, peasant.. Hold me dear. I'm the meadow I'm the pasture I wear colourful flowers on my dress. I'll make your herds shiny and fat For the boys and girls.. I'm providing a bed. Peasant, Peasant.. Cherish the meadow. I'm the field. Golden crops.. Are my dress. Golden crops.. You turn into bread.
