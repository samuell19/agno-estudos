Ladies and gentlemen! Dear friends, welcome... ...to the 47th Annual Meeting of the WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM! The oil-producing countries of the Arab world decided to use their oil as a political weapon. Let's take Gorbachev seriously, let's take Gorbachev at his word! Thank you. West-Berliners flock there, and scale the wall that scarred their city. In fact if you buy a new PC, the internet is a few clicks away. And it brought the major industrial leaders of the world together in this forum. I thank you. International terrorism was not, however, born on 9/11. Breaking news here, stocks all around the world are tanking because of the crisis on Wall Street. Today we are witnessing the first really global economic crisis. China will keep its door open wide open. And won’t close it. We are demonstrating against the self-proclaimed elite that tells us that they're gonna solve the problem but the problems are getting bigger. He has just arrived! Yes, but he does not want... - No Question! The session starts at 5:30pm? Everyone's feet need to be on the carpet, and not here. So scoot down, so everyone... You're good, you're our guy! You can be over here. You're fine. No one told me about video. If we didn’t feel the need to talk, the need for dialogue, we would live in a global dictatorship where everyone had the same opinion. Meaning that, not to just talk, but to let others talk too, is an absolute necessity for the social cohesion of our world. Klaus! - Mr. President! Welcome! Everybody is awaiting you! You'll see the hall will be packed. - I promised you. I am very pleased. - I am Hilde. Welcome! What is important is not only talking, but also listening. I believe this is the starting point, this feeling that we need dialogue to understand each other. Lovely to see you again! Wonderful! Thank you! Oh, well you've gotten even bigger! United States President, so... - Yes, I hear you will meet him? This, this has to go back! Please, just please, please. It's too dangerous! Please! Please, Please! It can't be past this. Everyone's feet on the carpet. Hello everybody! Hi everybody! How are you? Mr. President, good to see you! Yes Sir. - Lee! I just called you. Why don't we try, as a follow up, to engage Netanyahu also into that session? Exactly, that's why I wanted to connect with you, and if that's the case I'd like to pursue that with Mirek. I just invited him also for the dinner with the Chinese, and I feel Netanyahu would like to be with... let's say a Nobel Prize winner and so on... and that would solve the issue to a certain extent. I think so, okay. - Thank you! Klaus? - Martina, the invitation for the dinner with Mrs. Merkel, that should be on a premium letterhead it looks like... we're organising a trivial meeting. Okay, I am sending it per E-Mail though and that's the standard... Nevertheless, it just looks terrible. I would rather say you treat it as an attachment in the E-Mail, 'For a private dinner with the Chancellor of Germany', and so on and so on. Super. Okay, thank you! - Super. Yes! Merci. The purpose of our meeting today is to get a sense of where we are for Davos. So my patience with this community is very small, but I'm ready if they get it and they're ready to have all hands on deck and really have a conversation... you know, whatever we need to do. There is no other place like it, thank God! So many of them are there at one time. We have that conversation every year, right, that: "Why the hell are we going to Davos, 'cause it's just a room full of the bad guys?" We spend a lot of time and money sometimes trying to communicate with the bad guys, you know, we send ships, we climb their buildings, but actually, we can't do it without this collection of people. This collection of people are amongst the most significant leaders on the planet. They are the last generation of leaders on the planet that can change the course and avert this catastrophe. Therefore... we have to deal with them. In that sense, we've got no permanent enemies, no permanent allies. That desperate, untidy... bid to make friends with them. Where do we sit? How awkward do we feel? I get nervous about, you know, giving them so much power. They haven't done a very good job. But I'm ready to go in and have all kinds of truth-to-power conversations and make people feel very uncomfortable. Every year Davos happens, three thousand of the most important people in the world coming together in a very small, confined space for a very small, confined period of time and being constructed into a program, that delivers across a huge and ambitious range of different topics! Some of that can be revealed now to this audience. I think what is important with the media also is probably the question about the participation of President Trump and Macron. Okay, let's go! How many government members do we have cabinet level? So, 333, but then from 100 different countries. 333. My father was a close friend of Ludwig Erhard, and of course I was influenced by his concept of the social market economy, meaning that a company not only has commercial, but also social responsibilities, to everyone who has a share in it: the employees, the clients, the state. That’s what you call stakeholder-concept. And then suddenly I had this idea: Why not create a platform where all stakeholders meet each other? Business leaders, unionists, politicians and so on. And that was the idea of Davos. Back then, there was a book written by a Canadian about “The Global Village“, the Global Village. I said to myself: Wouldn’t that be ideal? To create a global village of global decision makers. A warm welcome to you, the 400 participants, for ten days here in Davos. My intention was never to make this my life task. But then so many people approached me during the meeting and said: “You've got to repeat this!" "This is of such great value for Europe!“ “Keep doing it!“ And in the meantime I was hooked - with my whole heart. And ever since it has never let me go. Hello, this is 'The Briefing', I am David Eades. Our top story: Selling America to the world: President Trump is set to give his keynote speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Mr. President, did you order Mueller to fire? What's your message? Did you seek to fire Mueller? Fake news, folks. Fake news. - What's your message today? Typical 'New York Times' fake stories. - Mr. Trump! My message is peace and prosperity. That's what we have. And we have a tremendous crowd and a crowd like they've never had before. Klaus actually told me, this is a crowd like they have never had before in Davos. Including all of you people, like they've never had before. So that's good. I assume they're here because of Klaus. Are you going to build a dialogue with Russia? We hope so. Thank you very much everybody! So you are going to be investing in the US? Yes we are, I'm the CEO of Bayer, we are working heavily on acquiring Monsanto. We are going to invest about 16 billion into the Monsanto headquarters... If you were the priest of a church, you would want to make the sinners come visit you on a Sunday. You wouldn’t want to lock them out. Or would you bar the sinners out? Probably the contrary. You would say: “I'd rather have them coming than those I see every Sunday." My name is Mark Tucker from HSBC, we're the largest foreign bank in the US. We have a balance sheet of 2.6 trillion $. It's a great honour to have you! Congratulations. I’m CEO of Novartis. We are one of the largest health care companies in the world. Today we have about 22.000 employees in the US, across 21 sites. We invest about 14 billion dollars every year into the United States. Mr. President, thank you very much for having me tonight, I serve the people of ABB. We have business in more than 100 countries of the world and bought some iconic brands in the US, like Baldor in Fort Smith, Arkansas, a motor company. It needs a little bit of investment in terms of technology. Did you get a good price? - Yes I got a good price. I know you got it, you always get a good price. I know who I deal with. He always gets a good price. Our number one global beer brand is Budweiser and our biggest market is the US, where we employ 18.000 people in more than 50 sites, so it’s big market for us. - Thank you. That’s fantastic. - Thank you very much. Hey Mr. President, I'd like to thank you first of all for having me, but also for spurring on all this growth. These are all my customers! - I know. It's just a real tribute to the momentum, that you've created in the global economy, so I thank you very much. SAP is the leading enterprise software company, I'm very proud to share with you that when you think about the Army and the Navy and the missions they run to protect the world, they run on SAP. You have done a really spectacular job. I guess pretty much everybody at this table is your customer, so that's not so bad. I want to congratulate you! - Thank you, Mr. President! Which companies are allowed to become a strategic partner in the first place? would a company like Monsanto, a seed manufacturer be able to become a strategic partner? It already is. - It already is a partner? Not strategic, but partner. - It is a partner? So firstly, why are you doing this? Monsanto's philosophy is to throw all ethics overboard to make as much money as possible, no matter what. How does this fit into the picture? Are you planning to convince them through dialogue? And can they be convinced at all, after all they are doing worldwide? They sold these single-use hybrid seeds to Indian farmers, for example. Yes, I understand your reaction. I do. And I have conducted many conversations with the CEO of Monsanto. I think, it is not all as bad as it looks. There is also - I'm not in favor of their products and they are seen as controversial, and some people would say they also have a positive impact by increasing the productivity of the agrarian sector, etc. This is a great deal for farmers, because farmers are starving for innovation. Our purpose is really to bring better solutions faster to growers, so they can increase yield and with that contribute to feeding a rapidly growing population. The Europeans are way more skeptical and quite frankly suspicious about what companies like Monsanto, Mr. Grant, do. Genetically modified seeds have been called a health menace by the French, the Germans call it “Frankenfood”. How are you going to get around that Mr. Grant? We think that this transaction really lifts the game for sustainable agriculture for decades to come. So this is a win for growers as well as a win for shareholders. I want to avoid the word 'educating'... but we want to confront people with their responsibility. And we want to make them contribute to a better world. The problem we face, is when people see the CEO of Monsanto in Davos, they mistake us as an organization that identifies with these people. And they don’t see the layer below, the intention of the whole effort. Great to see you! - Good to see you! How are you? Very happy to see you... - Yeah. Hi Klaus, how are you? Good to see you! - Welcome! Welcome Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. As we leave the European Union, the UK will continue to be a global advocate of free trade, seeking to bring new partners to the table. And of course, after we have left the EU, developing new bilateral deals with countries across the world. Good morning Ladies and Gentlemen, and welcome to this press conference, that's dedicated to answering the question, 'How can we move to more sustainable consumption?' A couple of years ago we launched a report that we will very soon have more plastic than fish in the oceans. Starting from that, we've built together an effort, a multi-stakeholder effort, to tackle that problem. I'm very happy that we're joined by David Taylor, CEO of P&G, To his left, we are pleased to be joined by Ramon Laguarta, the chairman elect of PepsiCo, Jennifer Morgan of Greenpeace. - Jennifer, please. Our current economic system, which is based on this endless consumption, the disposability and ongoing extraction of fossil fuels is broken. And it just can't continue this way. So Greenpeace supports the intention behind these efforts, but there's a real risk that projects like this become a bit of a distracting sideshow to generate positive PR, while major companies continue business as usual. So, prove me wrong on that one! I don't feel like we're all on the same page there yet. I'm actually very excited about this and I do believe members of the industry see the compelling need to work together to find solutions across many different, many different ways. Is P&G committing to set a reduction target of plastics across your entire supply chain? I hear Pepsi is interested or looking at that? What we're trying to do is design the bottles so that it has a minimum amount of plastic, however, the equation is not so simple... No, it's very complex, no doubt. - When you start thinking about glass, and returnable glass, then you say okay well then I'm gonna drive a lot of miles back into the factory. So we're looking at all these combinations of packaging, that will really reduce the amount of packaging we use per, let's say, per kilo. I don't have time much more for public-private partnerships alone. We've got 12 years left on climate to avoid 1.5 °C. So please work also to get the right policies in place. Thanks. Mr. President, after you have been so warmly received yesterday here in Davos, it is now my great pleasure to welcome the President of the United States, Donald J. Trump. I am aware that your strong leadership is open to misconceptions, therefore, it is so essential for us in the room, to listen directly to you. Please welcome the 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, to the stage. Thank you, Klaus, very much. It's a privilege to be here at this Forum, where leaders in business, science, art, diplomacy and world affairs have gathered for many, many years to discuss how we can advance prosperity, security and peace. I am here to affirm America's friendship and partnership in building a better world, like all nations represented at this great Forum. Now is the perfect time to bring your business, your jobs and your investments to the United States. Yes, hi. Can I scan your badge, please? Perfect, thank you so much! Thank you for joining! Welcome! Oceans, right? - Yes, great to have you here! My name is Dominic Waughray, I'm the head of public-private partnership here at the World Economic Forum, and we are the international organization for bringing the public and private and civil society together. What you will hear from this panel is a remarkable moment which is so pressing and so important for life on earth. And you'll witness the coming-together of the governmental community and the private sector to deliver solutions to save life in the ocean. Chief Sustainability Officer Coca-Cola; Chief Sustainability Officer of Unilever; Perez from Coca-Cola is here and Jeff Seabright from Unilever. Prime Minister Trudeau will set the stage, - Of course! Oceans protection is an issue that touches us all and we very much like to highlight and get the global community to show more leadership on its oceans protection, particularly around plastics and pollution. Thank you for coming to move us forward. I hope that you consider yourself engaged and it is ours. - Good news about this session is that every person in the room is an ocean person. The next UN Ocean Conference is 2020. What can we deliver by then? What's the most important priority to deliver for that conference? Alright, go! A lot of foundations and family offices, are really passionate to do this, but they don't have a means to allocate. The last four years we've seen a real revolution in thinking about the economics of climate change. So we actually can do it, it's actually good for business, it's good for the economy. We now need to do exactly that same thing for the ocean. We're in this period, WEF calls it 'Fourth Industrial Revolution', where we have sensors, genetic engineering, AI and drones. And what's interesting about all these technologies, is they don't improve linearly, they improve exponentially! So something that looks like it's gonna be impossible in ten years, actually gets done in four. So progress happens way faster than you think. If you look at the big problems we have with the oceans, all of these have technological solutions. You can track plastics. You can scoop up plastics, you can track fish, you can track people who are hunting in places they shouldn't be hunting. You can use Blockchain to track the tunas, it goes to market to make sure the people are buying the right tuna and keep fish supplies in line. But at the same time, the people outside of this room, the people who are doing the illegal fishing, the people who are rogue operators, have access to the same technologies. So you have the good guys have drones that are getting way better and the bad guys have drones that are getting way better. So there's a really interesting arms race. And it seems in general that technology in the oceans has not really... the good guys haven't really won the last 20 years. Alright, speak! I read the risk report, as I have most years. It's terrifying this year! But this is the situation that we're now in. And that's why we are happy that everybody comes together and becomes aware of the risk. You have to integrate much more the demands of those who have been left behind. We have to make sure that there is a clear improvement of the lives of those who have been left out in the globalization process. This is very divided - not so divided. Where are we in the divided world? Where are we in the fractured world? Very divided - less divided. I would say this is too simplified. You came up with the phrase 'fractured world'! How fractured are we? I think we are here - and what we want to do is here. You see. That's what we want to do. Here we are - and here we want to go. Good to see you, Sir. - Good to see you, Richard again. Stephen Carroll joins us from the World Economic Forum in Davos, you really had the sense this year, on the one hand Donald Trump, on the other hand Macron and Justin Trudeau, there really was a debate at Davos this year. There was a lot of self-promotion going on as I was saying from a lot of world leaders, they know that companies have money to invest and they want to make sure that money comes to them. The tone of this year's Davos meeting is quite different from previous years. And that's partly because the global economy is doing well, they don't have any major pressing issues to worry about, although several people I spoke to said this week they really should worry, we should be more worried about climate change, we should be more worried about how technology is going to change the world... So I'm Carl-Henric Svanberg and I'm the chairman of BP. And I'm here and we're celebrating 50 years of the World Economic Forum. I think we're all so incredibly impressed what Klaus and Hilde has achieved, it's a remarkable gift to the world. And this is a world that also faces serious challenges, because a lot of people feel that too little is coming to them and too much is coming to the few. The inequality of this world is not a good one. And a little bit further to the left, you have then the headquarters of Swiss Re and Zurich Insurance. I am Paul Bulcke, I'm chairman from Nestlé. I am working for Hoffman-La Roche, the pharmaceutical company. And I am chairman of the board of Jones Lang Lasalle, a global real estate services company. I am the US ambassador to Switzerland and Liechtenstein. So I represent the President of the United States and the American people here in Switzerland. The time that we spent with President Trump here at Davos, we had some fantastic opportunities to really negotiate and converse in a way no other place really can. This elite group that goes to Davos in a year, continuing the system and doing nice projects around the edges, they're a fundamental part of the problem. They are not creating a dream, they've created a nightmare! It's not credible. I don't know how they can sleep at night. It just doesn't fit! It's like this bubble that exists there, of individuals who are used to having power, it's a mega groupthink. And the thing that I find so dangerous about it, is the rhetoric and the narrative around it is that it's about making the world a better place. But I think it's like, 99 percent status quo. And maybe there's 1 percent around the edge that is trying to improve things. But I... I don't see real evidence that they're willing to do the hard work. It takes hard work, diligence, precision, commitment, day in and day out to solve climate change! It's not a fly-in fly-out type of thing. I don't see that there. It's a different world. This is the only drawback of our Chalet, it might not be high enough, so we constantly have fog and we sit right in it. Here we are. Now I can go to autonomous mode and use my hands while I'm talking. No. So you're with me, you're stuck with me! It's saying it's too dangerous to drive. There are people who say Artificial Intelligence will be the end of the world. But if we can deliberately, purposefully steer it towards the positive, then we can improve the lives of a lot of people, we can get rid of this congestion, for example. Would you work with any company in order to bring solutions to the table, even though a company has failed in the past? Why do you ask? - Because people lost trust in the system and some of these companies' integrity. The question you raise is, Marcus, is a tough one. You know, if people... if they lose hope... they... it's not a good place to be for anyone. And the only way we can show a better future is by making it happen. Not just talking about it, but making it happen. That's why we have a sense of urgency. Hi, this is Murat. How do you want to run the call? Maybe I can just spend a few minutes on the center itself or do you have any specific questions, I can start with answering those. The technologies that we have in our portfolio start with Blockchain, then Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, cross-border data flows, drones, autonomous vehicles... Sure, we share all of our results with the public, it's on Creative Commons basis. Sure, so we decided to open the center basically as a... think of it as a policy-accelerator. We take a city, state or nation as a pilot site, and we pick one, two or three technologies and say, how do we accelerate these technologies' benefit to the citizens? Recovery nominal. Shall I get the battery and you get the wing? - Yeah. Sometimes it seems like the battery is kind of sticking. Okay, come on in. - It's good to see something different! Well, if this isn't different, then I'm not sure what is. Come on in! It's an honor to have you here! So this is, this is our manufacturing facility, where we are building all of the autonomous aircraft now serving in Rwanda and Ghana. If you wanna just feel, Klaus, if you want to get your hands under to feel how heavy the aircraft is. You can just lift it up from where I was just grabbing. So one hand here. Super light, right? - Super light! No, it's light! This was the old version of the aircraft, so this was the first aircraft that we flew in Rwanda. I am very happy, that we were able to help with the legislation now. Regulation so that was because... - Very important! Without you, and I would say without us the regulation wouldn't have happened! So for you it must be so satisfying, to know you are life-saving, with what are you doing. That's why we're all here! And that's why you are social entrepreneur! Yeah. 5.8 million kids die every year due to lack of access to basic medical products. How much? 5.8? - 5.8 million. Kids. Every year! It doesn't have to happen. That's not a... I'm gonna pull up a chair. That's not a science problem, that's not a, you know, manufacturing problem, it's easy to manufacture the medical products... It's just... it's a logistics problem. It's that the roads are challenging, and we can't get to where we need to get, in order to get these products there. And so, you know, this is really what led us to do what we're doing with Rwanda. Those are the hospitals? - Those are the hospitals. So these are the hospitals we've been serving over the last year. From that distribution center, we can do deliveries. So this is a Zip coming by one of the hospitals that we serve. You can see us dropping the package from about 40 feet. 10 meters, 12 meters. And the package is designed to basically drift really gently to the ground. In this instance, we've been able to reduce waste to basically zero. Rwanda became the first country in the world to achieve a 0 percent waste rate for blood, and they did that while increasing access to blood products by 175 percent. - And the delivery time will be maximum about three hours, I guess? - Oh, much less! Yeah, I mean the maximum delivery time is something like 45 minutes. But average is between 15 and 20 minutes. 3, 2, 1... Governments are not necessarily willing to be the first one to try. Because if they fail, it has political implications. But by having them engaged with the Forum, a trusted international organization, impartial organization, to try these new concepts, new approaches, if we fail, we will take the responsibility, if it succeeds, then the whole world benefits. State Counsellor of Myanmar, Aung San Suu Kyi. The last years, there has been a lot of focus on the situation in Myanmar. I think last year you committed to repatriate a million people, the Muslim minority - Rohingya - that fled to Bangladesh. How do you feel about this situation? Do you feel that the military in Myanmar has handled this well? I know this has been a lot of international focus, but when you say "How did the military handle it", there are of course... ways in which we, with hindsight, might think, that the situation could have been handled better, but we believe that for the sake of long-term stability and security, we have to be fair to all sides, that rule of law must apply to everybody. The US yesterday appealed to you and to Myanmar, to let the two Reuters journalists out of jail. I think they got a sentence of seven years. But what is your response? And I wonder whether very many people have actually read the summary of the judgement. You've read it? - Of course, I am obliged to read it. And it would be... I think it would be very remiss of any member of the government not to have read it. But I would like them to read the judgement, and point out where they think there has been a miscarriage of justice. But I guess you also as a democratic leader don't feel comfortable with journalists being jailed. It's not a matter of... they were not jailed because they were journalists. They were jailed because the court, well... sentence has been passed on them. Because the court has decided that they had broken the Official Secrets Act. Good morning! Welcome. You have to be careful to construct the dialogue in a manner that doesn't rush to the main point, and then figure out, "How can I bring in my point of discussion?" I want to ensure you, how much we feel attached to your country and how we could continue to be of assistance. Related to peace, do you feel that a situation particularly on the western side of your country can be stabilized? Of course when everybody is shouting and expressing their own opinions, it does take a little longer than it would if everybody were quiet and went about it in a calm manner and sorted some things out quietly rather than on the world stage as it were. And you said a quiet dialogue... do you have... who is conducting the quiet dialogue? We always have of course contacts with Bangladesh, but it's not just Bangladesh, it's with all those involved, including the United Nations Agencies. We have done a lot of quiet dialogues in the world. I brought together Arafat and Shimon Peres to resume the relation and the peace discussions. Naturally, the people remember the image of the two opponents entering the stage hand in hand. right before the finish line of a Peace Agreement between Palestine and Israel. I then made an effort, if maybe we could help them to pass the finish line. It was planned, that Arafat and Peres would come to Davos to finally proclaim the breakthrough to the world public. Everything was meticulously planned, and it was agreed that Arafat would speak first. We took our seats on the stage. Ladies and Gentlemen, please welcome President Arafat. And Arafat asked me, "Please, ask Shimon Peres if he could begin instead, because I left my speech in the hotel room." We have a small technical problem, but we are flexible. So, Shimon Peres. I want to say, that the Palestinians and us are condemned to live in peace. None of us has a better or another alternative. Shimon Peres held a very conciliatory speech, in the nicest way possible. I sat on the stage and wondered, "Why is nobody coming to bring the speech to Arafat?" And as Shimon Peres' speaking time was up... Thank you. ...And you can imagine, I kept getting more nervous, Arafat took his speech out of his suit pocket and headed towards the stage... Mr. President, whomsoever really seeks to achieve peace, does not resort to killing, persecution, assassination, destruction and devastation as the current government is doing. He held a very inflammatory speech, which was fueled by hatred. At the end of the speech I turned to Shimon Peres, and Peres said, "I had hoped to take part in a wedding," I must admit, I came with the preparation for a wedding, "...but now I see I am attending a divorce." I could not believe it! To me, this was the biggest disappointment, the great, historical missed opportunity. And I think Borge is a specialist, having been the key negotiator in Colombia, for the peace discussions. Is there a good possibility for the Rohingyas who have left the country to come back? Well we have already signed a MOU to that effect to facilitate the return of the Muslims who have left from Arakan. We would like to welcome you in Davos finally. - Very far away. Very cold. And I find it one of the most difficult parts of conferences that the air conditioning is on full blast. And I am always freezing. The first thing I always do in a hotel in Asia, turn off the air conditioning. The difficult thing is quite often you can't turn it off. I always have a very clear premise. And you have to assess how you can bring it in. We haven't written to Bono yet, just came to my mind. - Bruno? Bono! -Bono? No. Dear Bono... Hilde and I were very concerned when we heard about your voice problems in Berlin. And we are so happy that you could reassume your tour. Mr. Schwab, it's the first summit where we haven't supplied bags. That's why the attendants didn't have bags, none of them! No, the bags are history because I insisted on not having plastics anymore. Although these bags are nice and were popular... we will probably have them for the last time in Davos, because the goal is to become plastic-free by 2020. A pity! Yet the people have to carry them, that was great promotion. ...was a good promotion, and I always saw it on airplanes. Next year, we were thinking of having this meeting possibly in Indonesia. You should come to Bali with your wife! - I know, that's one of the very few spots in the world I haven't been. Really? - Come over there, at least bigger than Davos! You know what, in Davos you are in Hotel Mamma Mia! We are together. - Like this, you know how... I said, what the hell is this, you know? But I said, the name of Davos is something, okay forget it. But over there, oh, very luxurious. I am telling you! So that's why we propose to you again, Prof, Klaus, to move Klaus over there! I think it depends very much, who takes the lead on the Indonesian side. We assume of course, that the President is re-elected. End of October? - October, yeah. 20th of October. Where is any opposition coming from? I don't see any. It's very hard to beat Jokowi today. People look at the progress and look at the result. The only problem they try to create, is about the currency, the depreciation of Rupiah. I don't see any reason to beat the President so far, unless we make a stupid mistake! Madame Lagarde said to me, "Minister Luhut, unbelievable, your President! President Joko Widodo, so close to the people So Prof. I think this is very hard to beat him! So it would be already the new parliament, but not yet the President. So parliament is under my control. So you are safe! We have established a palm oil initiative... - Oh really? Let me make it clear about palm oil! Palm oil we own like 14 million hectares, but 41 percent are owned by the smallholders. 41 percent! This is linked immediately to 17.1 million people. The poor people. That's all palm oil we can see there, right? Yes, that is the second phase of the palm oil that will be replanted. The big palm oil will be replanted with the new stuff? And this new stuff is the sustainable stuff? - Yes, of course. They have to be sustainable. So they're gonna get rid of all of this old one, to have sustainable palm oil come in? That's amazing. All around there as far as you can see? What we've learned is that we have to improve the health of our ecosystems, address the mass habitat destruction, the ocean challenge, the climate challenge. "Why can't we just have a project and fix the problem?" We've had rural development and agricultural projects for many years. But they're working in isolation! And there's people involved in organizing that project, maybe Ministry of Environment and NGOs, and scientists, all good people with the right cause, and there's people in this project, perhaps from the Ministry of Agriculture, research stations, businesses, all good people with the right cause, but not pulling in the same direction, pulling in different directions. And in the middle somewhere is the person who works on the land, is the farmer, as we saw, who wants to preserve the landscape because that is their asset from which they and their children will get their resources, but wants to have an income. And that is where we can help to create a space. Dominic Waughray from the World Economic Forum, nice to meet you! Thank you for finding the time. Please have a seat. - Thank you! The reason for coming is, we're in the second phase now of the Tropical Forest Alliance. And this would be much more about trying to find good examples of models that work. We collect all the independent farmers to form a union. Those collaborations, local government, central governments, the Ministry of Economy, the Ministry of Agriculture, has been very good model, that would have a collective impact for the farmers or the smallholders. The farmers, fishermen majority of them doesn't know anything about the good agriculture process, above the need to preserve the environment. So they can have a trust of the good agriculture process. What's the size of the challenge? Around 340.000 hectares, Mujibanjiis regency is larger than Netherlands. It's 1.4 million hectares. There is a kind of a revolution that's taking place on all levels in the system. A revolution doesn't have to be dogmatic and driven by a small group of angry people. With a positive journey in some of these spaces, all that anxiety turns to hope. It's interesting, cause it spreads up the feed chain, it spreads right to the CEO, spreads right to the board, spreads right to the chairman, spreads right to the head of the development agency, everyone's a human being. Everyone's a human being. The breaking news is the far right candidate Jair Bolsonaro has won Brazil's presidential race. Not a huge surprise, but an emphatic victory for the right wing candidate. "We have to close down our government, we're building that wall!" President Trump vowing to shut down the government, if that's what it takes to fund and build the wall. The Prime Minister faced a double whammy of bad news. This is the worst defeat of a government this century. This weekend saw another round of demonstrations by the yellow vest movement. French President Emmanuel Macron is promising strong action. Bolsonaro had suggested pulling Brazil out of the Paris Climate Agreement, calling conservation efforts "A threat to Brazilian sovereignty". Bolsonaro has pledged to allow agricultural and mining companies to exploit indigenous land. We have close to 70 Heads of State and governments. More than 300 Ministers. I think you also saw what I sent you this morning on the humanitarian and peace and reconciliation side. Libya, Syria, we have West Balkans. We have Korean Peninsula. And then we have Israel - Palestine! Brazil wants to send three additional Cabinet Ministers. I would suggest that Brexit we discuss tomorrow morning, after the vote. For France we will see whether Macron may decide at the last moment. Interesting to watch. Okay. Excellent. Thank you! The World Economic Forum in Davos hasn't even started yet, and it's all about who isn't here. - Breaking news, the White House has officially cancelled its delegation to Davos. US President Donald Trump, UK Prime Minister Theresa May, and French President Emmanuel Macron are staying home this year, preoccupied with pressing domestic issues. Good morning everybody, thanks for joining. I just wanted to get together before we go to Davos to potentially bring a voice in. You've likely heard of Greta Thunberg, reaching out into some of the youth. And this would be kind of my conversation if I have a meeting with Schwab would be about the school strike kids and that's the generation that's actually rising up right now. Even up on the 25-40 year olds, right? Who have...some of them, who have slept for a while. So that's one thing that I think that we should just see, if we can make something like that happen. And I wanted to just talk a little bit about Bolsonaro. I'm just wondering if we want to try and use his first international outing in any way. What we are doing is, we determine what we need and who should participate. Wednesday, there is a discussion with Bolsonaro? He will speak in Portuguese! I do not like so much to moderate a discussion, where I am not in command of the language. My idea is that the session... Let me see. I'm calling him. The Chairman of Nestlé, Peter Brabeck. Peter? This is Klaus. How are you? See, I'm sitting in a meeting and a small question came up. Do you speak Portuguese? I think so, fluently actually? Only Spanish? Then the question is unnecessary, I would've asked you to host the session with Bolsonaro. Great... Thank you very much! Bye, Peter. So I have to do it, probably. Okay, eleven o'clock? Dear Professor Schwab, I'm writing to you today on a matter of the utmost importance to the world: climate change. I am deeply concerned that as founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, you are not doing everything you personally can to help change the course of history. You have a tremendous opportunity to use the WEF and all your trusted relationships to save the planet from frightening impacts. We need individuals like you to step up and bring others with you. It is time to realign the WEF and Davos to the issue. For that reason, I would like to request a meeting with you during Davos. Sincerely, Jennifer Morgan. Are we worse off this year, than we were last? We are at a crossroad! There are so many threats, so many risks, and if we don't get them under control, we risk a kind of explosive situation. How able is the world to take this on board? It's dealing with a trade war against China, it's dealing with Brexit, there's a US government shutdown. The speed is so fast and so multifaceted! So people are overwhelmed by change. And what do they do? They revert to a bunker mentality! There's little time to address those issues! We have to make progress on multiple fronts. Let me give you the opportunity, Sir, to at least say that you regret the way the externals has become so commercial. I regret and deplore, because that's not the core and the essence of what we want to do, we want to improve the state of the world! Good to see you, Sir! It was really excellent! So what we're gonna do here, it is: 'Worries of the World' You can pick one or two: Trade, Brexit, China process... So what are they going to be? Just write the word... Egoism! I wasn't expecting that! Let me explain. With the bunker mentality we have a tendency to think first of ourselves, to protect what we have! That's egoism! And egoism translates afterwards in populism and all kinds of other things! Good to see you, Sir! Thank you! - Thank you Richard! Now off to the races. Thank you! - Thank you! Your Majesties, your Royal Highnesses, distinguished Heads of State, Excellencies, dear friends, I welcome particularly our business community, the representatives of civil society, the NGOs, and, very important, the participation of the young generation, of social entrepreneurs. With half of the population below 27 years old, we have to listen to the young people, and that's what we will do. Next one is Mrs. Merkel. Madame Chancellor! - Greetings! Great pleasure to see you in the realm of Davos! Welcome! - Thank you! And now the media, tremendous interest. Will we go over to them? - Yes, that is... On the red carpet, practically. - So, on the red carpet. We shake hands once more. Will you agree to extend Article 50? My goodness! Huge interest! Thank you! Whenever you are ready, we can go out. - Yeah. So... Yeah, I am always ready. As far as you can be ready in life. Mrs. Chancellor, big pleasure to have you here again! A warm welcome! Dear Professor Schwab, Ladies and Gentlemen, you have put a topic on this year's Davos agenda which is of utmost interest. The starting point is marked by the reactions towards one of the biggest crises, that is the banking crisis from ten years ago. We are put in the position of somebody who is forced to run faster and faster lugging a backpack with him loaded with 20, 30 kilos. These are the debts that we have incurred. It is a dilemma that we have to escape. When you look at the interest rate policy of the central banks, then we know that we are still effected by the crisis, that we have yet to escape it. We are bequeathing an incredible amount of debt to the next generation, that they have to reduce in whatever way. Meaning that we are living at the expense of the next generation. Everybody, thank you for coming. Winnie Biyanyima, sitting next to me, is the executive director of Oxfam. Jane Goodall probably needs no introduction. Rutger Bregman is a historian, I am glad to have him. Rutger, let's talk about concrete steps to get people out of poverty. I mean, I must first say, this is my first time at Davos. And I find it quite a bewildering experience, to be honest. I mean, 1500 private jets have flown in here to hear Sir David Attenborough speak about how we're wrecking the planet. And I mean, I hear people talking the language of participation and justice, and equality and transparency. But then I mean, almost no one raises the real issue of tax avoidance, right? And of the rich just not paying their fair share. It feels like I'm at a firefighter's conference and no one is allowed to speak about water. I mean, this is not rocket science! We can talk for a very long time about all these stupid philanthropy schemes we can invite Bono once more - but come on! We gotta be talking about taxes! What's gone wrong? How is it, that the most intellectual creature that has ever walked on this planet destroying its only home, destroying the environment and causing all these inequalities in our societies? We've broken the link between intellect and wisdom. We had the financial crash in 2008. Now we've seen the rise of populists around the globe. Trump, Bolsonaro, we've seen Brexit - and what gives me great hope right now is that there's a new generation that is actually waking up. That doesn't believe the myth anymore that the vast inequality we see today is just a force of nature. People waking up and realizing that they've been sold a lie. Thanks for taking the time. As I shared with you in my letter, I think that right now, I just don't think that we have the time for only mostly public-private partnerships anymore. Why do we have this Industrial Revolution 4.0? Well, we need it in order to deliver the solutions on climate change. And I think having you put the passion and the intellect and the convening that you've put into your Industrial Revolution 4.0 into this, that's what we need right now! And otherwise it's like parallel universes to be honest. So that's where I really think you have a massive opportunity, but also really a responsibility, if I may say so! I've worked on climate change for 25 years. I worked on climate change since '73! Just to tell you, because I was the person, who gave the Club of Rome, the first big platform! I share with you the concern and I think we can solve those issues only if we repair our global architecture and our global system. We need implementation and we need a scale-up. You say we don't... we just have to implement what we have decided. But it needs also a change of the whole mindset of people, particularly the business people. What is also important, I mean I can tell you, and I'm speaking very directly, the Brazilian President... and of course I'm concerned by what he said, not only about the environment, and we depend so much on Brazil, but how do you deal with those people? And I feel the world is so full of polarization at the moment! But I think he needs to hear loud and clear from business voices that the Amazon is off limits! I hope he gets that message loud and clear from everyone and doesn't feel... We all have to present this message. - Exactly! But you can do it the hard way, or you can do it some more nudging way. I have one final request, I've been talking to Al Gore about this. There are extraordinary climate leaders in the world right now. You have likely heard of Greta Thunberg. She's done a video, which I can show you, if you like, of a minute and 44 seconds. That that could be shown in the planetary event that Gore is moderating. And I'm happy to show it to you, so you can see what it is. No, I'm in full favor of it! Because it relates to the young generation again! It will certainly, how should I say, have an impact! Thank you very much! Thank you very much, I have to leave. - Yes, no, you're a busy man! Thank you! See you! See you later. - Bye bye! Welcome at the Arctic Base Camp. As a scientist that's interested in having solutions I am absolutely delighted to have Greta Thunberg and her father Svante camping with us tonight. Greta has just arrived at Davos today. And she can give us a few opening words. Why did you come to the World Economic Forum? I thought that this is not something you want to miss, because this is one of the biggest events, meetings in the world, and this is a chance to change things. I don't know. That's beautiful! And Greta, what is it you want to change? Everything! Yeah! That deserves a clap! Some people, some companies and some decision makers in particular have known exactly what priceless values they are sacrificing to continue making unimaginable amounts of money! I want to challenge those companies and those decision makers. I don't believe for one second that you will rise to that challenge! But I want to ask you to prove me wrong! Will you pledge to join me and the people all around the world, in doing whatever it takes? The greatest danger is the destruction of trust. In Presidents, in Prime Ministers, in Ministers, in political parties, in international organizations, in banking systems, in multinational corporations, in democracy itself. What was it about Brexit that suffered the most? It was the 60 percent of the young people whose future was at stake in the Brexit vote that did not go to vote! Because they did not think that democracy and that particular vote, that particular referendum had anything to do with them. And now of course they're regretting it! But basically we're losing them! It's worse than when they vote against anything, or they vote for change and they don't know what change means. They no longer go to vote in many cases. Because they have lost the trust in democracy. That is the greatest danger. Our house is on fire! At places like Davos, people like to tell success stories. But their financial success has come with an unthinkable price tag. And now is not the time for speaking politely! The main solution however, is so simple that even a small child can understand it. Everyone is talking about money. It seems that money and growth are our only main concerns. Adults keep saying: "We owe it to the young people to give them hope!" But I don't want your hope. I don't want you to be hopeful. I want you to panic! I want you to feel the fear I feel every day! And then I want you to act as if our house is on fire. Because it is. David, first of all... do you feel the narrative around climate change and environmentalism sometimes can be quite pessimistic and that actually there is a real need for injection of optimism? - That is not the point! The point is that we have this option ahead of us. We have to take the option of protecting the natural world. And we are discovering more ways in which we can do so! And still it's seen by some people that in fact humanity, and industrialized humanity in particular, is in opposition to the natural world. It is not! We are all one world! And that is why it is so exciting to be at this great, important occasion, where people attending it have more power, perhaps, than any other gathering in the world! We have the power, we have the knowledge, to live in harmony with nature. Beautiful. You really look very, very handsome! Good luck! Mr. President, welcome to Davos, Mr. President Bolsonaro, we are all aware that Brazil is going and will go through a period of decisive transformation under your leadership. We are looking forward to hearing your vision. The floor is yours. Thank you for the honor to address you at the opening of this annual meeting. This is my first international trip after being elected. For me this trip is a great opportunity to show the world this unique moment of Brazilian history. I want to present the new Brazil here, that we are currently building. We are the country that cares most about preserving our environment. No other country in the world has as many forests as we have. The ones who criticize us have in fact a lot to learn from us. We are governing by taking actions. We will rescue our values, not just for the good of Brazil, but also for the good of the whole world. Thank you very much. I am doing a panel this afternoon it is called 'American Power'. I am a professor of economics at Harvard University. I've done a lot of work on central banking, and give talks and stuff, so... I'm trying. Yeah, absolutely! Hello. I am a good friend with Alfredo Sirkis. Way back your friend Sirkis was my enemy in the armed struggle. Oh, I didn’t know that. So I brought up the wrong person. No, no, it’s not a problem. The episode of the military involvement in Brazilian history has been poorly reported. The truth always comes to light. You know, we’re all deeply concerned about the Amazon. I am sorry to raise this issue in an informal meeting but I care passionately about it. The Amazon will never be forgotten. We have a wealth of resources. And we would very much like to tap into these resources together with the United States. I am not sure what that means. I love the American people. Brazil has just elected a President who likes the United States. And the Amazon may be the solution to the whole world. I know you, we are no enemies. We just need to talk. I am always eager to talk. Thank you. - You're welcome! Thank you. Mr. President, Jennifer Morgan. I lead Greenpeace internationally. Good to meet you. I've heard by some of my colleagues from business... ...your commitment to protecting the Amazon. I just wanted to reach out and say that I was pleased to hear that and say that protecting the indigenous rights is a very big priority for Greenpeace Brazil. Sounds very good. I was chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. I haven't been in South Africa in a while, but I am so happy with you being President. I just spoke to Bolsonaro. Oh my god! How did you get yourself there?! Is he here? Which one is he? He is standing there by himself. You are brilliant! They all want to talk to you, Mr. President. Mr. President, congratulations! I am from Hong Kong. Nice to see you. You think that a girl of the age of 16 can make a difference? - Oh, absolutely! Could that be the rise of the children? I hope so. If people's hearts and emotions don't get moved by this movement of young activists, they're not human anymore. I just... I'm very grateful for all her work. Thank you very much. I think Klaus is clearly a highly intelligent man, who's devoted his life from his perspective to trying to make the world a better place. But, I think it's important that all the leaders that go to Davos are confronted with this. And Klaus Schwab certainly, his cage should be rattled and he should be rattling the cage of everyone that comes! Yeah, you have to take'em on, you have to... be willing to risk your relationship, risk your status, risk all those years of... bringing people together and being liked. You have to risk all of that! We keep talking about 'the poor' and 'the weak' but 'the poor and weak', that is the next generation! They cannot defend themselves against the unsound decisions we are taking today. Power! - Power! We started with a financial crisis, it became an economic crisis, then it became a social crisis, it's going to become a generational crisis. The older generations have failed tackling the biggest crisis humanity has ever faced! Dear Greta, I share fully with you the conviction that time is running out. I am very happy that your movement has gained so much strength since we met in Davos just some weeks ago. Now! What do we want? - Climate justice! This is what democracy looks like! The planet! The planet is on fire! We are not letting them steal our future. We need dramatic action. Systems change, not climate change. Such action cannot just come from politics, But has to start with each individual on our planet earth. I am also ready myself to make a commitment. I will have the participants of the next Annual Meeting in Davos sign a commitment to action, but tailored to the important responsibilities in business, finance and politics. With my best wishes, yours Klaus Schwab. Canada is moving ahead with the plan to reduce plastic waste. I'am very happy to announce, that as early as 2021, Canada will ban harmful single-use plastics from coast to coast to coast. A small country taking a huge stand against climate change: Costa Rica has a plan to go fossil-free beginning next year becoming the first decarbonized economy in the world! Costa Rica already generates more than 90 percent of its electricity using renewable energy. The Amazon is burning in full climate crisis and the planet is losing a part of its lungs under the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro. After the European Union has signed an agreement obliging the South American countries to achieve the climate goals of Paris Agreement, the trees are still falling in Brazil, home to 60 percent of the Amazon. Dear Professor Schwab, thank you for your letter and sorry for the late response! I am happy that you have watched the progress of the 'Friday for Future' climate strikes. For many decades, leaders have known of the seriousness of the climate crisis and still not taken the action required to protect future living conditions for humankind. The people who have failed most are those with the greatest responsibility. Those are the kinds of people who attend the World Economic Forum. Their inaction is unacceptable and unforgivable. It is not up to us to bring emissions to safe level. That it is up to those in power today to stop avoiding their responsibility and lead! It is time for those with influence and power, including yourself, to respond to that call. With best wishes! Greta. Today we are in the Fourth Industrial Revolution. The dangers, the risks are innumerable. But I think that this revolution will in the long term possibly contribute to a better world. You have to make a decision. Do you want to live in the past? And reject everything going on around you? Or are you willing to embrace the future? We are experiencing a change that is forcing us to think about the nature of our existence.
