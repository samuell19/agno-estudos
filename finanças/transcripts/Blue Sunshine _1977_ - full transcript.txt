- Mrs. Rosella, como estas? - Okay. - Did you bring any of my favorite fettuccini this time? - (whispering) Doctor, you don't look so good. Aren't you eating? - Yeah, well, you know there's a little too much aggravation around here, right? - Yeah. - All my patients aren't such sweeties, you know. Look, why don't you get some rest. I want you to be strong, okay? Go to sleep. - Doctor? Are you gonna cut me up again? - We'll see. We'll see. - [Samantha] I want it. (TV chattering) - So the next day I had some friends who came to the castle. And I called up to the princess. Rapunzel! Rapunzel! Let down your hair! So-- (screaming) - Jason, would you cut it out? My head is killing me. - So then the princess untied her long, long hair, and dropped it out the window. - Then what happened? - Jason, do you want to hear the story or don't you? I'm gonna charge your mother extra for this. It's not in my contract. - Quiet, Jason. Go ahead, Wendy. - So, he grabs unto Rapunzel's hair, and starts to climb up to the tower. - [TV] Bring these ideas into government. Working within the system. - [Samantha] Look. That's Mr. Flemming, Wendy. - [TV] Ed Flemming takes to the street-- - Yeah, Mr. Flemming's running for Congress. Maybe someday, he'll even be President. - [TV] Subsidized medical care, better housing. - [Samantha] Can we come visit you at the White House, Wendy? - [Wendy] I don't think so, kiddo. Mr. Flemming and I aren't living together anymore. - But he's your husband. - [TV] Ed Flemming is the future. Paid for by the Flemming for Congress committee. - So he grabs onto Rapunzel's hair, and starts to climb up to the tower. Do you wanna do it? Okay. All right, here, try it. Ow! Ow! - Look what I did. - [Barbara] I wish he would quit the force. At least I'd get to see him once in a while. - No, Barbara, that's the worst thing he could do. He'll be sitting around the house, with his face in a bottle from morning till night. - Johnny, no! No more chocolate pudding! I made that for your father! Now stop it! Oh, Ritchie, I don't know what to do anymore. I feel like a wreck. Maybe it's my fault. - Your fault? He leaves the house at seven in the morning. You don't see him again until midnight, and he comes home cracked out of his brains. - I don't know, maybe it's the strain. He's been having nightmares lately. And sometimes he talks in his sleep. You know, sometimes, sometimes being a cop-- - Oh, come on, don't give me that cop bullshit. Please, Barbara, look. It's not that tough being a cop. And don't tell me about the hair now. I know all about that. Look, I'm losing a few hairs myself. He thinks he's the only guy in the world that's losing hair? Hey, John. Come on, Shep, let's hit the sack. - Goodbye, Ritchie. - Good night, Barbara. - [Parrot] Hello Johnny. (eerie music) (squawking) Blue Sunshine. (eerie music) Blue Sunshine. - And she was like a statue, stiff. It's like I reached a point and I ran right over her. I just went up... What's the matter? - You remember Rodan? - The artist? - No, the monster. - Hey! Hey! - Okay, everybody, let's get together for a group shot. - [Man] Frankie, let's hear Just in Time, what do you say? - I wanna get a picture, here. - [Man] Come on. One more time! - How about Just in Time? - Come on, don't be shy! (everyone murmuring) - [Man] Come on. Let's go! (everyone murmuring) - Dim the lights and hit the spot. - Good. All right. - [Man] Yay! All right! Here we go. - Okay, just give me one second here. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Jerry, I love you. But I work alone. - [Man] Oh, come on, let's go. - Frankie! - Hey, wait a minute. What's this? What the hell happened to his hair? - I don't know. Did you see that? He looked like a cue ball. - Hey, Jerry, why'd he shave his head? - I don't know. I'll be right back. - [Alicia] Wait a minute. - Hey, come on. Joe, come on. Hey, we gotta go looking for him at least. Come on. - You okay? - No. - Why don't you take something? - God, I drank too much. I need some honey, that's all. - Honey? - Yeah, it settles my stomach. It helps. - Hey, Zipkin, we're gonna go into town and look for Frannie. - Why don't you go into town with them and get some honey? - Oh, come on. Come on with me. Please? - [Jerry] Hey, Joe? - [Joe] Yeah? - [Jerry] Take her with you okay? - [Joe] Yeah. - Joe, do you have a flashlight? - A flashlight? What do you need it for? - I'm gonna stay and look for Frannie. - Oh, come with us, Zippy. Please? - Here you go, Tonto. - Thank you. - Zippy, please. - [Jerry] (whispering) Love me? - Yes I do! - No you don't. - Yes I do, god damn it. I do! - Do you think it was a joke? I almost shit. - Coming from Tony, it could have been a joke. But I don't know. It looked so real. - Yeah, and it didn't have any stubble like he shaved it. Those long strands... Where are they? Did you see his eyes? - Oh, shut up, Tina. You're giving me the willies. - That must be them. - No! Stop! No! Stop! - [Jerry] Shit! - Shit, man. Hey! You! Check his heartbeat. He's dead. I'm going after him. Hold it, man. You move and you're dead. I said stop! Stop, man! You're sick. You're scum, man. I'm gonna wipe you all over this place. Hold it right there, man! - I didn't kill anybody! - Stop, man! I'm gonna shoot you again! I mean it! Stop! - So, how long have you known Zipkin? - I met Jerry last summer. - You two living together? - No. I don't have to answer your questions. - Afraid you do, Ms. Sweeney. You know, you're lucky to be alive. Your boyfriend might have just let loose on you. - Jerry didn't do this! - What's your first name? - Alicia. - Alicia, that's a nice name. I have a boy about your age. Look, miss, give me a break, will you? - I'll talk to my lawyer before I talk to you. - Damned television shows. - Anything? - Talk to my lawyer. - Well, he can't get far. We've got a make on the car and a plate. - Well, I'm not so sure, Lieutenant. That guy Zipkin is erratic as hell. - What do you mean? - He graduated from Cornell, at the top of his class. And now he hasn't got a pot to piss in. He must've had 10 jobs in the last five years. He quit his last one because the firm wouldn't hire enough women. - And then he barbecues three of them in a fireplace? - I'm just afraid he might make it into the city. - I'll just have to follow him into the city. - Okay, Mr. Zipkin. You can wait for the doctor in his office. It's straight down that hall. - Thank you. - [David] Oh, Zipkin, I can't wait to hear this one. - How are you, Davie. - I'm okay. How the hell did you get yourself shot? Let me see it. Come on. Not bad. Can you lift your arm? Go inside. Take off your sweater. I'll be right in. Oh, Zippo, so this is what it takes to get to see you, huh? - How does it look? - It doesn't look bad. Pretty clean, I'd say. Let me just clean up some of that blood. Okay, does that hurt? Relax. You look terrible, you know that? You look worse than I do. I have a woman dying of cancer. She tells me that I look bad. A hunter, huh? Did you get the guy's name at least? - No. - Hold that. That's too bad. Those schmucks will shoot at anything that moves. I have to report this, Jerry. - What report? It was an accident. I don't want to get anybody in trouble. - Jerry, it's rules. It's the law. I have to report all gunshots and knife wounds. Now tell me what happened. - I told you. - You sure it was a hunter? - Yes. - Then how come you don't want me to report it? - Because it was an accident. I don't want to get anybody in trouble. Is that it? - Yeah, that's it. Hey, Zipkin, I want you to fill this prescription. It's antibiotics. I want you to get some rest too. And change the dressings yourself. - Are you losing your hair, Davie? What's the matter? You don't feel good? - Aspirin. This job has a lot of pressures, they don't tell you about in med school, believe me. But I don't do anything stronger than that anymore. You know that, Zippo. - I appreciate it. - Oh, it's all right. Look, give me a call in the morning. Let me know how you're feeling. - How much do I owe you? - Forget it. - Well, I'll see you next time I get shot. - Next time you get shot I'll charge you. - Okay. - Well, anyway, the haircut removed any damaged hair. This is gonna do the trick. It has animal protein in it. - No. No, I don't want any of that on my hair. Nothing. - Well, what the hell do you think your hair is made out of? How often do you wash? You know, sometimes too much washing can make your hair fall out. Wendy, when was the last time that you had any? - Writing a column. - Sometimes that can make your hair fall out. - Just because you pull your hair out, when you don't get enough. - I'm not making this up. No, I read it in Cosmo. It affects your bio-rhythms. - Wendy, would you please give me a glass of water? - What's happening? What's wrong with me? - Samantha, why don't you take your brother home, and watch TV there? I don't want you spilling paint on Wendy's carpet. - Okay, Mom. - Stephanie, something's wrong with me. I don't know what it is. I've been having these awful nightmares. These headaches! These headaches are driving me up the wall. - Have some coffee. - You know what this weekend is? - What is this weekend? - It'll be a year since Eddy and I broke up. - Oh, so that's what's wrong. Baby cakes, take it from a veteran. Nothing affected me more than when The Beatles broke up. My divorce was nothing compared to that. I felt betrayed. But then I realized that they had become a part of the past. - How can I forget Eddy, when his gorgeous puss is plastered all over the city? - I'm sorry I'm late. You said the north side. This is the south. - I'm sorry. I'm not thinking too well. - What's this, a suit? - I borrowed it. Are you sure you weren't followed? - I don't know. - Did you bring the car? - Yeah. Here are the keys. It's a Bronco, my uncle Larry's. He's out of town. - Where is it? - It's up there. Look, I told the police you'd turn yourself in. You can tell them how it happened. Shit, Zippy, they could tell by looking at you, you wouldn't kill anybody. - But I did kill Frannie. I pushed him in front of a god damned truck. - You had to. - But I can't prove that and a lawyer can't prove it. And I can't go to jail, not even for one day. I'll go bananas. - But running makes you look guilty. This Lieutenant Clay guy's come down here, looking for you. He follows me everywhere. They have you pegged as a psycho case. - Frannie was no monster. He might have acted like a god damned monster, but something made him act that way. - What could make anybody act like that? - He used to get these headaches. I thought he was a hypochondriac. But it's obvious that they were... Real... - What are you gonna do? - Look, I'll call you. - I wanna go with you. I wanna go with you! Don't do this to me! God damn it! - [Jerry] Excuse me. - Yes? - Hi, I heard about what happened in the house across the street. - Are you a reporter? - No, I'm not a reporter. - I said all I plan to say. Thank you. - I'm not a reporter. I just don't understand why anybody would kill all those people. I just don't understand. - You a cop? - No. - Did you know Johnny? - No. I read in the paper that he killed his dog too. - Richie, that's Richard Grosso, the neighbor on the other side. He heard screaming coming from the O'Malley's, so he took his dog Shep, a big police dog, and he went over there to see what it was all about. I was the one who finally called the cops. That's when I heard a gun go off. - A gun? - You're sure you're not a reporter? - No. - When the cops arrived, they found Richard Grosso, lying dead at the top of the stairs. His neck was broken. And upstairs, they found all the O'Malley's, lying dead, in big red pools of blood. Johnny put a bullet through his own head. And the others were... - The dog? - Old Shep? His jaws were broken wide open. Bent all the way back, like this. - Do you think I'd be able to get in over there? - You're an insurance adjuster. - No. - Well, you won't be able to get in over there. They've got it locked up tight. I sure wouldn't wanna set foot in that place. You know, Johnny was the gentlest thing with those kids. I never thought he's make it as a detective. I thought he'd be too soft. I guess you never know what goes on inside people's heads, do you? - I have one other question. Johnny, Mr. O'Malley, do you remember when he started losing his hair? - You know, that's the strangest thing. I never knew he was bald. - (screaming) No! - [Parrot] Hello, Johnny. (squawking) (squawking) Hello, sunshine. - (whispering) Blue sunshine. - I'll tell Mr. Flemming for you. - Well, what the hell kind of an organization do we have, Joe? Jesus Christ! There are about six people out there! Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know about that bullshit too. No, I'm not interested in that. Forget it! Hold on. What is it? - Great news. We got Shopper's World Mall for the big rally. - Well, that's something. You hear that, Joe? We've got the mall. No do me a favor and get some bodies out there, and make sure they're voting age. - Ed, some guy wants to talk to you. - What's his name? - Jerry Zipkin, I think it is. - Zipkin? Zipkin? I don't know any Zipkin. Well, did he say what he wanted? - Just to talk to you. - All right. - Mr. Flemming, I'm gonna go ahead with the puppet people, now that we've nailed down Shopper's World. - Absolutely. Have those typed up for me. Mr. Zipkin? Hi. What can I do for you? - I'd like to talk to you. - Sure. - Can we do it alone? - Well, I'm pretty tied up right now. - It's very important. - Okay. - Mr. Flemming, did you know a guy named Frannie Scott? - Frannie? Sure. Hey, how is he? I haven't seen Frannie since, oh my god... Oh, wait a minute. What do you mean did I know him? - Frannie's gone. He died. - I'm sorry. Wow. - Hey, Ed, you got a minute? - Excuse me. - Ed, I'd like you to meet Pete Tiller, here. - Hi, how do you do, Mr. Flemming? - Hello. Voting for Ed Flemming? - Sure, why not? - That's not a very healthy voter attitude. - Well, I don't know very much about him, do you? - I've known him for over 10 years. We went to Stanford together. I played a little football there. Did you ever hear of big number 32, Wayne Mulligan? - Sorry. - Well, that's me. - And you're... - I'm Alicia. I'm waiting for Jerry. What are you following me everywhere for? - Missed you back home. - [Alicia] Well, what the hell are you doing here? - I'm sorry. Well, what was it? - It was some kind of a disease. It's hard to explain. - Mr. Flemming? I have the puppet people on the phone. They want to talk to you. - In a minute. Well, I guess that's it then, huh? - No, no, no. Wait a minute. There was a picture of you in his studio. Oh, yeah? Well, that doesn't surprise me. Oh, he'd shoot away at anything. No, no, this was different. It was all distorted. You were distorted. Did you ever hear the words blue sunshine? It was the caption under the picture. I thought you might know what it meant. - No, I never heard of it. - Mr. Flemming, you want political caricatures, or show-business personality type of puppets? - Nothing political! Well, I have to go now. - No, no, no. Wait a minute. This blue sunshine... It's just a hunch, but I have a feeling it had something to do with Frannie's disease. - Listen, I don't know what you're talking about. And I'm sorry about your friend. Now, if you'd kindly let go of my arm. - If you'd just tell me anything. - There's nothing to be told. Nothing to think about. - Any problem here, Ed? - No, it's fine. It's all right. - What was that all about? - I don't know. We'd better keep an eye on Mr. Zipkin. He could be a trouble maker. - What did Flemming say? - He knew Frannie. - And blue sunshine? - He was real sweet to me until, he heard the word blue sunshine, and he just clammed up on me. - Okay. Frannie, O'Malley, and now Flemming, all graduated from Stanford 10 years ago. - What did you say? - Some big guy that works for Flemming told me. They graduated from Stanford 10 years ago. - Davie... - What? Zippy, Davie who? - Look I don't want to get you involved. I don't want to get you in anymore trouble. - I'm already involved. - Okay, listen. Flemming knows a lot more about blue sunshine than he's telling us. I want you to find anybody, a girlfriend, a friend, anybody, who might have known him back at Stanford. - Okay. - Zipkin? - Is Dr. Blume in? - [Nurse] Dr. Blume, please. Okay. Sorry Dr. Blume's in OR. - Operating? - [Nurse] Yeah, it's a safe bet. - You know what room? - Hey, you're not thinking of going in there? - No. - O.R. five. - Thank you. - [David] Kelly. Come on. Kelly. - [Surgeon] Long instrument. - [David] Kelly. Kelly, I said! No, give me a sponge! Give me a sponge! Kelly! Long instrument. I said a long instrument! Scalpel. Scalpel! Christ! You scared the hell out of me. Zipkin, what are you doing? Ow! Jesus Christ, man. Are you nuts? What'd you do that for? - Davie, I lied to you about the bullet wound. - No shit. - And the suit. I'm sorry about the suit. I'll get you a new one. - Jesus Christ, Zipkin. Are you nuts? You're catching me at a very bad time, man. I just lost a sweet old lady on the table. You come of a closet, yank my head off. What are you doing here? - I thought you had a disease. - That's why you're here? You thought I had a disease? What disease? - Two guys lost all their hair, and they completely flipped out, and began murdering people. - So what does that have to do with me? - Well, you went to Stanford at the same time they did. And you're losing your hair. - Who are they? - Frannie Scott and John O'Malley. - Frannie Scott? I met him at a party with you, right? The photographer? The crazy guy? John O'Malley, I heard of him. I don't know. I never met him. - How about Ed Flemming? - Eddy? Sure I know Eddy. As a matter of fact, he just called me last week, for a campaign contribution. I owed him some favors. - What do you mean favors? - Just some favors from a long time ago. 10 years ago we were in college. You know everybody had to know somebody, in order to score, so I knew Eddy. - Flemming was a dealer? - Hey, now wait a second. Let's not-- - That explains it. That explains it. - [David] Jerry? - That explains it! That explains it. That explains him clamming up! - Hey, now you wait a second here. This is just between us. You know if something like that comes out, in the middle of a campaign, it knocks him right out of the box. - Davie, did you ever hear the words blue sunshine, back in school? - Blue sunshine? - Could it have been a drug? - It could be. Yeah. You know how many different types of names they had for acid back then? Blue cheer, Owsley purple, orange... Oh my, I remember. Name of blue sunshine. I scored it from Eddy. - From Flemming? - Yeah. Yeah, he was my only source, so-- - Shit! Then it couldn't have been blue sunshine, because it didn't have any effect on you. - I never took any. - What? You never took it? - Oh, no. I never fooled around with acid. You never knew what you were getting. I mean kids were making batches of it in chemistry class. I just bought it and I sold it, at a small profit to help pay my tuition. - Who'd you sell it to? - Oh, Jerry, strangers. I would never take a chance on selling it to a friend. You never knew what you were getting. Look, let me get something straight. Are you trying to tell me that you think that people who took blue sunshine 10 years ago are suddenly suffering from alopecia totalis, followed by insanity? - Ala what? - Alopecia totalis is complete lose of body hair. - Could that have a delayed effect? Like a time bomb in the... - The chromosomes? - In the chromosomes. - It could but it's highly improbable. - How could I prove it? - You'd have to take a blood test for genetic damage. - But I'd have to get one to cooperate. - Jerry, I don't understand something. What does all this have to do with you? - Plenty, Davie. Plenty. Davie, how do you stop a madman without killing him? - I give up. Jerry... Listen, will you-- - [Jerry] Davie! If somebody goes completely berserk, and has the strength of drowning man, how do you stop him? - I don't know. Drugs? - Drugs? - Yeah, drugs. An injection of barbiturates, tranquilizers, whatever. - How do you get close enough to inject him? Davie, could you get me some? - What? - Tranquilizers. - Look, Jerry, this is not Stanford, you know. I can't just go around writing prescriptions, like I'm scoring drugs. - Yeah. - Zipkin. What about Frannie? - Frannie's dead. - Look, I can't promise you anything. I'll see what I can do, okay? - [Eddy] I don't have to stand here before you and talk about the unemployment problem. We're all sick and tired of hearing about this problem. But no one's as sick and tired of hearing about the unemployment problem as the unemployed. Now the question is, how do we make the private sector in this country and the government work together to solve this problem? We've lost a trust. A trust in ourselves. A trust in our fellow Americans. And a trust in the leadership of our government. But we can re-capture it. We can and we must. We must and we will. - Hi. - Hi. - On your way to work? - Oh, no, just doing some shopping. Window shopping. My taste is too expensive for my pocketbook. - See anything you like? - Plenty. - Good let's go. - Where? - Shopping. I have a good expense account. That's one of the advantages when you're not getting paid. - That's nice but I really couldn't. - You go with that guy? - Which guy? - The guy you were with at the rally. - Jerry? We're just friends. - God damned trucks! - I really have to be going. Some other time then. - Say, you like window shopping? We're having a big rally at Shopper's World. Why don't you meet me there? - Yeah, that'd be great. When is it? - Tomorrow night. - All right. - The disco-tech in the mall called Big Daddy's. Meet me at the bar. - Tomorrow night then. - [TV Girl] I'd love to go and play with them. - [TV Boy] Then maybe she forgot all about her promises. - [TV Girl] Now you wait here Peter and I'll be right back. I'm only going across the field to play for a while. - [TV Man] My gracious sovereign, have no more worries. - Are you sure you don't mind watching the kids? - Oh, I don't mind. - Well, it's just hard to clean the apartment with them under foot. - I don't mind. Really. Honest, I don't mind. It's all right. - Okay. Listen, just let them watch TV. And if they fall asleep, just leave them there and I'll pick them up later. Okay? - [Wendy] Okay. Who is it? - My name is Jerry Zipkin. - [Wendy] Who? - Jerry Zipkin. I'm a friend of Eddy's. - [Stephanie] Hmm, not bad. - [TV Man] It was a terrific battle, with the crowd cheering the brave warrior. - Hi. - Hello. - Come on in. - Hi, I'm Stephanie. - Hello. - I'm just on my way back to my own apartment. Are you sure about the kids? - [Wendy] Stephanie, I'm sure. - Well, nice meeting you. - [Jerry] Nice meeting you. - Eddy and I are divorced. - I know. - Would you like some coffee? - No, thank you. - Hi! - They're Stephanie's. This is like their second home. So how's Eddy doing? - He's great. I saw him last week. I think he's gonna win the election. He's a great salesman. - I know. Well, you caught me right in the middle of putting the dishes away. - It's okay. - Well, come on in. - Mrs. Flemming? Did you ever hear of an acid called blue sunshine? - Acid? - Yes. - You mean LSD acid? - Yes. - [Wendy] Blue sunshine... No, I've never heard of it. Were you trying to score from Eddy? - No. No. It's just that he had some acid called blue sunshine when he was at Stanford about 10 years ago. You went to Stanford, right? - Just for two years. - Well, this acid, this blue sunshine... I'm trying to find out who he sold it to. - Are you sure you're a friend of Eddy's? - Yeah. Well, I mean, you know, not really a friend but-- - Why try to implicate him in dealing with acid? - I'm not trying to implicate him. - Why bring that up now? That was 10 years ago. - Mrs. Flemming, I'm not trying to implicate him. I'm just trying to find out who he sold the acid to. - I don't believe you. Didn't your mother ever tell you it was impolite to stare? - I'm sorry I stared at you. Mrs. Flemming? Mrs. Flemming, if you could remember anybody who Eddy might have sold the drug to, it would be very helpful to me. - I never heard of this drug called blue sunshine, and Eddy was never selling it. - But you just told me one second ago. - I know what I said. - You said you were looking to buy drugs. Now I realize you're just trying to get Eddy in trouble. Now would you please leave? - [TV Man] Goodbye friends! Bye! Bye! Bye! - [Kids] Wendy! Ice cream! (loud echoing voices) Wendy! We want ice cream! We want ice cream! We want ice cream! We want ice cream! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! Wendy! We want hot dogs! We want hot dogs! We want hot dogs! We want hot dogs! We want hot dogs!

Come on. Now, go home. Where's Wendy? What did you do? - [Jerry] Shut up! Shut up! (phones ringing) (operators murmuring) - I'll be at this location until noon, so that'll give me plenty of time to get over here, by three o'clock anyway, okay? - [Woman] Okay, fine. - Ed, Lieutenant Clay. Homicide. - Lieutenant. - Terribly sorry, congressman. - Not yet. I mean I'm not congressman yet. But thank you. Lieutenant Clay, I don't recall. - Oh, I'm working up around Tujunga Canyon. Actually, I'm working on a case that might have some bearing on your wife's death. The man I'm looking for matches the description of her killer. - Remember him? - Yes, I do. Jerry? Wayne, what did he say his name was? - Zipkin. Jerry Zipkin. - Yeah, the woman down the hall from your wife, Stephanie? - Andretti, yeah, Stephanie Andretti. - That's it. Yeah, she gave me the same name. Just wanted to make sure. Zipkin was at that rally of yours, at the shopping center. What were the two of you talking about? - I don't recall, Lieutenant. People come up to me all the time. We spoke very briefly. - He was looking for some kind of work. We didn't have any. He wouldn't take no for an answer. - That's when he came over to me, Lieutenant. He asked for a job, right. I didn't have anything for him and he got kind of physical and Wayne came over then. - I'd watch him pretty closely if I were you. - Yeah, well, Wayne here is my walking insurance policy, Lieutenant. - Mr. Flemming, are you sure you never knew Zipkin? - That's right, Lieutenant. Just that one incident. - He took an awful chance coming to you like that. Are you sure he just talked about asking for work? - Well, I guess that makes him more of a maniac, doesn't it? - Yeah. Yeah, I guess it does. You try to make sense out of something that's so senseless. - Yeah, I know what you mean, Lieutenant. Well, I guess that's it then, huh? - Yeah. Thanks very much. - Thank you, Lieutenant. - Hey, how you doing, Jimmy boy? Hey, baby. You can't fight that feeling, man. Hey, Jimmy boy? Spot me for a cigarette, will you? Hey, get out of here. Hey, get out of here! Get out of here. Get out of here! Get out of here! Get out of here! Oh, there he is, sweet Jesus himself. Here, man. Here, man. Do it for me, would you? Here. - Where the hell have you been? - Did you bring the stuff? - What the hell happened to you? I've been waiting over an hour. I feel like a god damned pusher. Shake hands with me. Shake hands with me. That's it, Zippo. I don't want to see you anymore. Don't come around the hospital, okay? Been watching you on the news. - It's not true. - [David] I know. You think I'd be sticking my neck out if I thought it was? - You sure this stuff will work? - There is enough paraldehyde in there to paralyze an elephant. You don't believe me, go over to the zoo and test it out. Oh, about the acid. I went through the school yearbook. There was one guy on the football team. All he wanted was acid, acid, acid. Wayne Mulligan. Oh, no, there's a cop. Get out of here. Get out of here, Zipkin. - Davie, you're a peach. - Will you get the fuck out of here? (whispering) Get out of here! - Clay. - Oh, Sergeant Clay? Alicia Sweeney. - It's Lieutenant Clay, Ms. Sweeney, but go ahead. - Look, I think I can prove to you that Zippy's innocent. - [Clay] Who? - Jerry. - Look, Alicia, if you'll just tell me where Jerry's hiding out. - I don't know. I've been trying to reach him myself, but I can't. That's why I need your help. - Help with what? - Look, I'm meeting this guy tonight, at the rally for Edward Flemming. Yeah, well, if you could just have him tested, I'm sure you'd understand what's been happening. - What if this guy tests out okay? - Well, then I'll help you find Jerry. - Now you're talking. Where do I meet you? - This is your Walther LP3. It's 177 caliber. Single action. Loads one pellet at a time. Got your hand pump. It'll shoot accurately for about 50 feet. And it is the most powerful hand pump gun I've got in store. It'll cost you $79.99 plus tax. - Will it shoot target darts? - You've got to hold this baby with both hands. Let it down slow and steady. Squeeze the trigger, don't jerk it. Cause if you jerk, it won't work. - Got to hold the baby with both hands. You got to let her down slow and steady. You got to squeeze the trigger. Don't jerk it. Cause if you jerk... It won't work. I'll take it. Excuse me. I'm looking for Wayne Mulligan. - He isn't here today. - Do you know where he is? - No, he had one of his headaches. - What do you mean headaches? - Are you a friend of his? - Yeah. - Well, he'll be at Shopper's World tonight. It's the last rally. - Shopper's World? - Right. Tonight. - Thank you. - Hi. Vodka martini. Two olives, please. How's it going? - What? - How's the rally going? - Oh, well, I haven't been feeling too well lately. I haven't been over there yet. Who are you looking for? - No one. I've never been here before. It's nice, isn't it? - The music is too loud. I'm gonna go wash up. I'll be right back. - What? - I said I'm going to go wash up. I'll be right back. - Where is he? - He's not here. He said he was going to the men's room. It's been about 20 minutes. I don't know what happened to him. - The men's room is up here? - Yeah. - I'll go check. - Okay. - Are you okay? - Sure, just fine. - Okay. What's his name? - Mulligan. Wayne Mulligan! - Hey, can I use the sink, huh? - It's okay. I'll take care of him. - Well, he's been like that for a while. - I know. (laughing) Thanks though. - Maybe some air or something, you know. - Yeah. Okay, Wayne, upsy-daisy. - Thank you, Joe. You know, I've always wanted to share a spotlight with Frank Sinatra and Barbra Streisand. I think, finally, this is my day. A day to begin the work that will lead us down the road to full employment. - Hey, what's going on? - There's a bald maniac in there. He's going bat shit! - You dirty killer bastard you! - I didn't kill anybody! - Like hell you didn't! - I didn't kill anybody! - [Eddy] Wayne! Get me Wayne! - You want Wayne? I'll get you Wayne! He's gone crazy from that acid you sold him, and so did your wife! - [Alicia] Sit down. No, please, Wayne! No! Oh! Please, don't! Jerry, help me! No! No! Zippy, are you all right? - Jesus Christ! What the hell are you doing here? You wanna get yourself killed? - I was just trying to help you! - You just stay right here and don't move! - Hold the baby with both hands. Let her down slow and steady. Squeeze the trigger. Don't jerk it. Cause if you jerk... It won't work! (gunshot) - [TV] The need for lower cost mortgages. Subsidized medical care, better housing aid... - [Eddy on TV] It's time to make America good again. - [TV] We need your help to put Ed Flemming in Congress. Vote in the special election, Tuesday, December 14th. Ed Flemming is the future.
