THREE TREASURES When Earth was created, The highest place in the sky, was named Takama-ga-Hara. The Earth's crust had not even been formed. Earth was still not a firm and livable place and it floated like a giant. The first god who was born was Ame-no-Minakanushi. The two gods that were born after had really great powers to create. Later on there were ten more gods born. The last two gods that were born were Izanagi, a god, and Izanami, a goddess. I have work for you. The Earth is still not firm. Make its floors steady and make it habitable. And like that, both gods created their paths and they reached the bridge that extended from the Earth to the sky. An island! There are no flowers or bloomings... We will build a country. How? Getting married. This will be our country. Meet me at the other side. And that's how the gods got married. And they created Oyashima. Calm winds resided over Oyashima. On its floors trees and plants grew and the ocean and mountains bloomed with lights. The pair made other gods and goddesses. The most gorgeous one was the goddess of the sun She was the one that governed the sky, the god Tsukiyomi governed the night and the god Susano-o, governed the ocean. Is that all true? It's a really old story and my obligation is to say it over again so it's not forgotten. Can you see very far? Old stories are all full of beautifull life. Just like those clouds, like the calm winds that blow, like the green fields... It all feels eternal life. The prince! Here comes the prince! The prince! - Here comes the prince! - Here comes the prince! You are a very valued guy, prince Yamato. He has a point, that's why all the girls like you. I am happy. I will marry all of them and I will have a lot of kids! Here, for you! This one is different from his brother! Who are you? What gives you the right to insult him? Then, you don't know? What? Tell me. What has happened? Problems, sure! Release me, release me! Calm down! What are you going to do? They have told me that my brother has had my father's slave! It's just a rumor! Don't worry! That's what I hope! I will make sure of it! I want to see it with my own eyes. Release me! I have seen you! What? Bastard! It isn't any of your business! Please, stop! Get out of my sight! Prince! My brother will never return! All right! Wait till my father's judgement! His brother will not come back. Gone mad, prince Ousu... It don't surprise me at all... We all know he has the strength to kill a stag. It's something so awful! Then now the prince is the heir! The prince has killed his brother? Unbelievable. Punish him. Punishment means death. It's what he deserves for killing your heir. I can't do that. Your town expects it! He is my second in line heir. You have two more heirs. I have sent for you. I know it, father. I am ready for the punishment. This does you honor. But that's not why I sent for you. But for you to go to war. You've heard about the Kumano brothers, who live in the West. Do I have to fight with them? They're very strong and worthy and they terrorize the people. Will you be able to defeat them? Do what you can! Yes, you are right. Congratulations. Thank your father. I swear upon the Earth and Skies to make your wishes come true. The prince is leaving! He goes to war! He'll make a stop at the Ise sanctuary! The parents can go all the way there! I have came to say goodbye, and to thank father for having trust in me. That's considered, very considered. Have you told him about your brother? Why not? Because I don't want him to know it. What a sincere man and very open! Father understands it. Yes, but even in Ise, they'll say you killed your brother. I know. That girl is behind all of this. When I saw her face, I could not kill him! After all, he is my brother. I understand. You believe me! You believe me, don't you? Of course I do, because I love you like if you were my own son. You're like a mother to me. Then go fight, son. Yes. My men are drunk. Go with them. Yes. Adorable! She's a virgin from the sanctuary. What's her name? Ototachibana. Oh, I see. You are exquisite. Ototachibana. Hey look at that! It's the prince! Yes, the prince! Must see it to believe it. He is dancing with his men like if he was one of them. Hey, why don't we dance? I have found a precious jewel! Victory is ours! You have came! Because didn't you come! Are you Okabi's mother? Your mother can't say goodbye? Do you think I am going to die? No way! This woman gave birth to me and I've had a wonderful life! The poor woman wants to be with you. She wants to be with me? That's easy! Come, let's go! A very cheerful guy. And very conformist. He thinks he has had a great life. I'll wait for you for ever. When I come back from war, I'll ask the prince's permission, and we'll get married. Promise me you won't die! Yes. Why have you done that? Is it cause... you will be mine? Ototachibana. I beg you to tell me the truth. Won't he come back alive? It is very possible he won't. Kumaso Takeru is very strong and ruthless. The prince is very young and is no rival for him. But why, why is his father sending him to such a dangerous place? I can't seem to understand it. The Emperor is not doing it out of his own will. So then, the Emperor...? He was in love with the prince's mother. But she died, and the second Empress is from the Otomo family. So then, the men next to him... Otomo opposes the prince to be the heir. He wishes one of his nephews to be the heir. Poor prince. I feel sorry for him. Please, I beg you, detain him! Don't think I haven't thought about it. I love the prince like if he was my own son. But when I saw how happy he was, I couldn't detain him. Now the best we can do is encourage them. The only thing I am left with is praying for their victory. Princess Ototachibana! - It's me! - Don't come any closer! Why? I couldn't sleep so I came to the river. Not even the night could make me forget about you. A happy encounter. I am happy I came. I love you! Having met you before leaving, it's a good omen, I can feel it. Be happy and pray for me! I made this. Don't forget that I will always be with you. Please... Please, take this too. The prince would have liked this. It's vulgar. You seem worried. You don't have any reasons to. The emperor has resigned himself. The prince will not come back alive. Of course not. So then, our prince will be the heir. Go on... But, didn't the prince kill you? No, he forgave me and told me not to come back! But! Can't go on hiding forever! I will apologize in front of my father for what I have done... I can't keep on like this. Very well, I'll help you. Nobody must ever know about this. Take him away. They kill the ones who don't want to be slaves. That's how the land of Kumaso is like! I swear I will kill them. You say they bring gifts from Kumaso? Yes. He says he wants you to be friends, wants to make a pact with you so you can both thrive. Nonsense! Is he scared to fight? No, he just wants to speak with you. He says the one perpetrating these cruel acts is his brother. I don't believe him! Let him be gone right away! Is this your final word? Yes. I must obey my father and thank him for having trusted me! Very well. You have done what you were supposed to do! Quick, bring me sake! Going to war, we'll hurt a lot of innocent people. A lot of them will die. Please, I'll ask you again, let me speak to him. I am sorry. My brother and I, we are very diffrent. Does he deny that? I understand, then it can't be helped. If that's what he wants, tell the prince we will be enemies. We'll meet on the battlefield. I will tell him. Good. Let's go. Kumaso has a lot of men! Where will they come from? It's amazing. It's well protected. It's going to be hard to attack. It doesn't matter, because we know we will win. It's kill or get killed in war. What d'you mean? There's only one way out. Which one? Leave it and return home. Idiot! Look! Okabi! He had a wonderful life, and now he's dead. And this man? A stranger who came to Yamato some time ago. It seems he's from Izumo. He wouldn't have minded. Bury him with Okabi. She loved a man who wasn't from the same clan. It wasn't forbidden before. They've prohibited it, after the prince has left. Will he be safe. Will Okabi be safe? - Should we call them? - Yes. Maybe our thoughts will reach them. Okabi! Yakumo! Azami! What a rotten luck you've had... You die and we can't even put you a tombstone. I will pray for you, if you pass me your luck. Really! Yahara! You have scared me. Do you want to be successful? Of course, Yakumo, like everyone else. I think you already are, as a cook. Having ambitions is human. I'd do anything to make it. But I am already starting to doubt it. Yes, because with all these dead, do you think we have any chance of winning? Prince, they've filled the fort with provisions, so they must be celebrating! What? The Kumaso are rich and powerfull and will have a big party! And very loud, too. They are very self-confident. Maybe too much... Prince, Heaven is on our side! Yes, we can attack during the party! It's not that easy. The party can be a trap, a trick to lure us on. Are you underestimating us? We have too few men! We can't win! Please, talk to Kumaso! No, our couorage will carry the day! Prince, courage alone can't win! Of course it can! Your life is precious. If something happens to you... I have seen all this people brutally murdered. How can you tell me to retreat... .. after having seen such atrocities? You say there's more men? They keep a strict guard! A surprise attack is impossible! All right, I'll go tell the prince. Prince. Prince. He's not here! Prince, isn't it dangerous? Calm down. Tell the others after I've left. Yes. When I'll have killed the Kumasos, I will give you a sign. Then it will be the time to attack. But, prince, it sounds dangerous! We have no other choice. It's either them or us. Look, brother. It's a great banquet! Look, everybody's here. They have come because they fear us. Be careful. The men from Yamato are few, but strong. You're praising our rivals. Stop! My princess! Where are you going? To check on things. What a cautious guy! You! Take that veil off! Come on! You've heard him, take it off. Come near. Out! Hey, brother, you are too cautious. So adorable. Where are you from? Get closer. Come on. Gorgeous eyes. Stop! Leave him to me! Wait... Wait! Are you scared to die? It's not that. Are you the prince of Yamato? Yes. What's it to you? Prince. You have the fame of a strong and wise man. Don't spoil these virtues. That's none of your business! From now on, let you be known as Yamato Takeru. What? Why Yamato Takeru? It means: "the strongest man... .. in our country. " I'll die a happy man knowing it's you who killed me, because I have to pay... for my brothers brutality. You know, one day, I had hoped to speak to you. I've hoped for days you'll come. After our conversation, I would have killed my brother if it had been necessary. I would have done it, had it meant lasting peace. Kumaso! I ask of you... .. to grant me... .. one last wish. Kill me! The prince of Yamato, now known as Yamato Takeru, has killed the brothers Kumaso! Do you know where the prince is? He's there. Why? Because I've brought him a gift. You don't give up, do you? Wars can make me big, if I get an opportunity. You're in a hurry to be big, aren't you? Now he only asks from me to cook for others, but I'd also like to stuff my own belly. I don't think it's a crime. My prince, these girls were in the Kumaso fort. This one's a good cleaner. And this one's a good cook. So what? Can I keep them? Idiot, I won't allow you! Yamato Takeru? The strongest man? No, you can't use the name Yamato! The glorious Yamato name can't be appropriated by only one man! I am totally oposed! Kumaso Takeru gave it to me before he died. I dont think that is a honor. It is, because he was a good man, so I will use that name anyway! I wont allow it! What? What's more, you must leave right away for the East. Is this true? Evil men are taking advantage of the chaos reigning there. You must kill them. But I've just came back from war! Those are the Emperor's orders! Do you agree with this? Otomo is right. Why must I go? You have killed all the Kumaso! Only you can do it. But neither my men nor I have had time to rest! Can't someone else go? Wakatarashi, what are you saying? I can't. Father needs me to talk to. Logi! Can't you go? Logi is too young! But... But... Are you not obeying the Emperor's orders? Yamato Takeru means "the strongest man"; aren't you going to live up to it? What? Please, wait! What are you doing? Let go of me! Father! Please, wait! Where are you going, father? Please, answer me! Where are you going, father? Never forget the stories of your ancestors, because they are the best remedy for the evil in our world. The beautiful sun goddess will rule the sky. One day she ordered for some fabric to be brought, to give it to the other gods, like a token of friendship, and she watched her maids industriously working. Then her brother, Susano-o, passed by, who always took pleasure in teasing his sister. He killed a horse, and threw it where they all were. Chaos erupted, and a poor maid died tryng to escape. The sun goddess usually forgave him, but this time, terrified by the cruelty of what had happened, she went into hiding in a cave in the skies. The goddess went into the cave, and closed it from inside. So the light was gone and then came darkness. Not only in the sky, but all over the world. And then it was always dark? The evil gods took advantage of the reigning darkness, and plunged the Earth into chaos and ruin! Susano-o was like a destructive storm who destroyed everything on its path, wasn't he? And his sister, the sun goddess, was the one giving us light and heat, wasn't she? You are right. Then, the other gods, decided they had to do something to make the world right, and that's how they met on the banks of the river Amenoyasu, the traditional place of their councils. No one disagreed, and there was no argument at all, because they knew they all were in the same situation, and wanted to make the best plan. Well, well... I didn't know light was that important. Without it, it's very cold. It's not only cold. All living creatures will die. What are we going to do? It's not our fault. It's all Susano-o. If we punish him, maybe the Sun's wrath will die down. Good idea. Susano-o should be punished, and he should show remorse. Yes. But that won't make the sunlight come back. The Sun's patience has been severely tried. She won't forgive him. It reminds me of when Susano-o messed up her fields, and then made her palace smell really bad, and all that just to have fun. He was her beloved brother, the closest to her heart, so she always forgave him. But this time... What can we do? Crying won't help. Let's pick someone to hear the gods' suggestions, and then decide accordingly. Yes. Good idea. Whatever you say we do. Does everyone agree? Is this your answer? No, it's just that I am cold, let's hurry. Of course. Very good, then, I accept the mission. Someone has suggested that we should punish Susano-o and then get the Goddess back. Who agrees with me? There are not too many raised hands. Does anyone have another idea? You haven't said anything, Tajikarao. Do you have an idea? You know that I am very strong, but not too clever, right? Yes, yes, Tajikarao that's right. You're the smartest of us all. So tell us your idea. Well my idea is very simple. A laugh festival to be precise. A festival of laughter? Yes, as you all know, laughter is the joy of life. Of course we like humor. How do you plan on doing it? We will all meet here and laugh. How are we going to laugh without a reason? I have it all planned. Besides being a festival of laughter, it will be a purifying ritual. Tell us what is it about. It's about an exotic dance. Everyone involved? That sounds very interesting! Yes, but will it be enough? Everyone must help. Of course. Whatever it takes for the sun to come back. And now, I'll tell you what conclusion they came to in order to solve their problem. First, we will bring out roosters that sing at night, just like if it was sunrise. Then, Amatsumaura, the blacksmith, made a halberd; another god made a mirror. Another one made a bead necklace. And then they raised up a sacred tree, and they hung on it all the objects made by the gods. The gods took the tree and prayed. They took the tree to the cave and, as they were giving it to the sun goddess, they prayed. The strongest god hid by the entrance... .. of the cave were the sun goddess was in. The sun goddess, who was still inside the cave. knew that Heaven and Earth were in complete darkness, so she was intrigued by all the laughter she heard. Why this big festivaI? Aren'tyou in darkness? Yes, but a god more important than you has come, and we're singing and dancing for her! What? A god more important than me? Please, don't do that again! Is she the other goddess? Who's the other god I am seeing? Can't you see it? It's you looking at yourself! And like this, the Earth was full of light again. A very interesting story, for warming your hearts, isn't it? SANCTUARY OF ISE You are Yamato Takeru, the strongest man. You deserve that name. I am happy to be your aunt. You fought very bravely those terrible Kumaso. You'll distinguish yourself once again, fighting in the Eastern Lands, making me very happy. Are you crying? I am sad, I can't stand this. What's going on? My father awaits my death! How dumb! You're imagining it. No! When he sent me to fight the Kumasos, he only gave a few men. And now, I've only just came back, and he sends me to fight in the East! He loves my brothers more than me! He wants me to die! Don't act like a woman. Be a man! I thought you were like the god Susano-o. Who? Me? Yes, but I guess I was wrong. He was wild, but happy. He cried and laughed. His father had given all his siblings something to do. He was to rule over the Sea. But he only thought about his beloved mother, who had died recently. The sun goddess rules the sky with joy and your brother skillfully rules the night. Why don't you want to work? Because I want to go where mother is! You can't go! Finish your work first. You don't understand. You don't love me! You don't love me! Words can't explain how much he cried. His tears took all the water from the Earth, and dried evrything up. He cried so much that it drained all the water from the oceans, from the rivers and also the lakes. Stop being weak. Prince, I understand! Really? It does not matter what she says, you're not like Susano-o. How do you know? Can you read people minds? Only yours my prince! Do you know what sword this is? No. The Murakumo sword. What? The sword found in a dragon's tail? A messenger has just brought it. The Emperor has sent it to you. My father? He gives you his most valuable treasure. This proves his feelings for you. I understand. I didn't know. The men next to him fear you and want to get rid of you. Ignoring them would bring great harm to the Empire. Try to understand his position. I will give you this. Don't open it now. Open it when you are in trouble. It will protect you. This sword and this bag are better than a million men. Now, I will leave with happiness! I'm glad to hear that. However, the sword is not to kill but to defend yourself. Try reasoning even with evil men. Take the sword out only when needed. Sort things out by talking? You're right. My men are tired, they will like that a lot. Thank you very much. I'm leaving relieved. He was so happy... Why did you tell that lie? He likes you like a mother. The Emperor's love is his only strength. When I thought he was going to leave without it, I felt sorry for the prince, so then... It might help him for a while, but when he finds out... I'm so sad! It's more than sadness, isn't it? It will seem very cruel, but I have to say this. A virgin serving the gods should not love a man. If you do, you will provoke the Gods' wrath and you will die. Princess Yamato... Don't forget that. Look what a good sword! Prince, is there any story behind it? Yes, I will tell you. It is related to God Susano-o's behavior making the sun goddess lock herself in a cave. He was not allowed in Heaven so he came here. He got to a big river and he stopped, undecided. He found some floating chopsticks. That's how he learned that people lived upstream, so he decided to go up the river. Who are you? Calm down, I am Susano-o, the brother of the sun goddess. God Susano-o, we did not know. Forgive us. My name is Anazuchi and I rule this little village, that is at your disposal. This is my wife Tenazuchi, and this is my daugther, Kushinada. Why were you cryng? Has something happened? Yes, you are so kind to listen... My wife and I had eight children, but, now, we're only left with this one here. Some sickness or something? No, nothing like that. They were sacrificed. Sacraficed? Why? The dragon with eight heads, he comes every year and kills one of my daugthers. A dragon? He has eight heads and eight tails. He is very strong. - His eyes... - Be quiet! Please! He is so big he covers eight valleys at a time. His stomach is always full of blood. It's time for him to come again, it's really sad our last girl will die! That's why we were crying! We're full of sadness! Lady, I will kill it for you. Really? Yes, I promise. Do you trust me? Yes! That's how I like it. What do you say? - Please help us! - Please help us! All right. We have to get prepared. I will transform you. Will it hurt? Don't worry, you will be with me. You see, you're already transformed. Tell me, do you like it? Yes, I do... That's your daughter. He asked the elders to bring strong sake. Itwas put in eight jars, and they waited for the dragon. It's coming! Relax, it's only the wind. The dragon is here! Hey, hey! The sake had been double distilled, and was very strong. The dragon got drunk and fell asleep. That was... .. this sword. It received the name of Murakumo... .. and was offered to the Sun Goddess, whom he had so often upset in past days. The god Susano-o married the beautiful Kushinada. Ah, you are here! Come with me! Let us be happy in the East! What happened? It is that... I cannot go with you. Why? Why? Because... Because... Don't you like me? It's not that. Then, why? I still have your mirror. Speak! Prince... I cannot go with you! Princess! Princess! Tell me! Tell me why! I will tell you! Because I hate you! I won't return to Yamato. Why, Azami? Because marrying somebody from another clan... .. means death. My father comes from Izumo, for that reason I am inferior to you. If they discover us... .. that means death! Is it a new law? They dictated it after the prince left. Many have already died. Be calm. You don't have to worry. I pronounce you husband and wife. Prince! I will change that law! Nobody should come between a man and a woman's love! Let us go! We have not even walked for one day since we've left Ise, so why are my feet so heavy? We're only one day away from our houses. Seeing my family has made my feet heavy. A battle could help, but all villages are empty. There is not a trace of anybody. Without enemy, there is no battle. There is not even someone to talk to. The soldiers are bored. Everybody ran away... when they learned that our prince had killed the Kumasos. Do we go very far? Until we find the enemy. Look, there! He is irritated, as all the young soldiers are. He longs for Princess Ototachibana. We have to encourage him. When a girl leaves a man, he needs another girl. Who is this woman? You are of bad mood, prince. She will console you. What? She is a girI from around here. I know she's not too good, but she'll for sure cheer you up, you will see soon. Why do you give her to me? Is she perhaps yours? Yes. You are a swine! No, have pity! You can leave! Prince, there are five more girls in my situation, can they also leave? Five more? You're a swine! All of you can leave! Thank you, prince! He said that you were cruel! I will tell everybody that it is not true! Thank you, prince! Thank you! Prince! What do you want? A woman has come to see you! I am the princess Miyazu of Owari. I have come to speak with you. Where is the prince Yamato? The prince fell asleep as soon as he arrived. What? Then, he doesn't distrust us? Although he has killed the Kumaso brothers, he is a gentle man. I understand. Even so, we should be in guard against any surprise. If I were not sick, we could have escaped. I cause you many problems. No. That is not true. I promise to protect you and our home. He is a great man from Yamato! Serve him roasted deer and scallops! I am Yahara, the second greatest man of Yamato! Remember me well! Also, bring the best sake! Wait a moment, let me try! Very good, yes indeed. Second greatest man, how's the sake? Are you already awake? I was very tired. I have slept deeply. I have brought you sake. So... Very good. Owari is beautiful and peaceful. Your father is a good man. Are all my men also drinking? After a long time I feel just as if I were in Yamato. Is there an adorable princess waiting for you in Yamato? No, I don't have a wife, although there was someone whom I had hoped to marry. Why has she not come with you? Because she didn't like me. I cannot believe it. Neither could I. What's with her now? Don't ask. I've already finished with her. You are a good man. I had doubts about you. I don't blame you; I am feared everywhere. Everybody hides when I approach. But you have received me with open arms, and that makes me very happy. I thank you. Tell me, are you afraid of me? Show me a smiling face. A woman's sad face saddens me, too. Smile for me! Don't drink this sake! Forgive me, I thought that you were an evil man, and I wanted to kill you! Really? I put poison in the sake! Poison? Please, kill me! But forgive my sick father instead! Why have you not killed me? I can hardly believe it. It is like in a dream. Do tell me, do you love me? Yes. But... What's the matter? I am so happy that it scares me. Do you have doubts in me? No. You honor us, prince. I give you both my blessing. My clan is very fortunate. The wedding will take place when I return from Azuma. Will you wait for me? Yes. Congratulations, congratulations. I am happy to see that the prince is happy again. Our next march will be much more pleasant. You? I don't want to see her! Send her away! She has traveled a long journey... I don't want to hear it! Prince, why you don't speak with her? Well then, I will meet her. What happened? I don't want to speak with her. She is very beautiful. She's the woman you're in love with, isn't she? Why have you come? To serve you, my prince. To serve a man whom you hate? No! I have decided to marry the princess here! That I have heard. Return to Ise! No! I have come to be your servant, not your wife! No, return! I am not able to! These are your aunt's orders! Leave him. Don't marry him. I know what I say, my daughter. If he really belongs to another woman, the best thing is to leave him. I won't give up! He doesn't lie, father! He may have loved another woman, but he also loves me! And I love him! But he will on Iy make you unhappy, my daughter. I only have this love. I will wait until he returns. If he really loves me, he will return. Until then... I will wait for him. Hey, you! Answer us, where is the house of Kurohiko? We come from Yamato. Answer, or you will die! It is at the foot of Mount Fuji! Yamato Takeru is coming? Yes, he will come very soon. We came before him. What do I have to do? You shall kill him! What!? It is the desire of the Emperor! I cannot believe it. Yamato Takeru... .. killed his older brother. Really? Do you unterstand now? It is true. After killing the Kumaso brothers, he became very proud, appropriating the name of Yamato. Do you understand it now? Now the Emperor's heir is Wakatarashi. Do you refuse? Do you refuse to obey the Emperor's wishes? Kurohiko, do you refuse? Prince, don't you like our hospitality? I have always got along well with the Yamato. I don't harbor hostile feelings toward you. Instead, I am happy that you have come. I understand that. The matter is... I am so fascinated by that volcano, that it has taken away my appetite. It is Mount Fuji and it protects us. How beautiful it is! He seems angered, it reminds me of by ugliness dwelling in our hearts. Prince, let us enjoy some sacred dances. The girl that you have brought from Yamato will dance for you. The girl that I have brought? Here she comes. You? You have forgotten that she serves in the Sanctuary of Ise? Forgive me, I didn't know it! I should be punished for it. It was me who requested her to dance. Prince! How about hunting boars? Boars? I will organize the hunt. There! There! Where is everybody? Hey! Hey! Prince! If you hate me, why do you follow me? What I said about your aunt's orders... .. it was not true. What? I serve the gods and should not love a man, however... I cannot stop loving you, although it causes the anger of the gods! Ototachibana! You love me so much? Is that true? Yes. Is anybody here? Hey! Hey! Prince! We will die! Damn, they have betrayed me! Hey! Will this be our last hour? I've always thought that Yamato Takeru'd die on a battle field but not this way! Forgive me! If I am with you, I don't care if I die! The bag! I had forgotten it! My aunt said that to open it up when I have problems! How strange, it is flint! Wait for me here! Don't move! Don't worry! I have a plan! Look, the wind is changing! The wind has changed! Prince! Prince! How could we have lost him! Look at that fire! Seems like a great fire! What is that fire? A great fire. And the prince? Where is the prince? Poor prince. Why do you say that? He got lost in the reed and is dead. It was an accident. Here I am! I am not dead! It is a trap! Be careful! It is still burning. The messengers of Yamato must have seen it. Now I can go to Yamato. If you want I can take you there. If you'll help my business thrive... What's happening? It is the prince! It is the prince! Kurohiko! Was this your idea? Or did someone else make you do it? Speak! Come on! What use is it to you killing me? Turn your sword... .. against Otomo... .. and your own father! My father? This is a lie! It's impossible that he might have wanted to kill me! Kurohiko wanted to confuse me... .. and wanted to make me suffer! Had my father wanted to kill me, why would he have given me this sword? You were there, too. My father gave it to me, didn't he? Wasn't it like that? Why do you keep silent? It wasn't my father's idea? Tell me, was it my father's idea or my aunt's? Speak! It was my aunt's idea? It wasn't my father after all. He has never loved me! He wants me to die! - Don't speak this way! - No! I have been a fool! I don't trust anybody any longer! - No, he loves you! - Remain silent! I will go far away from here! To the confines of the Earth, to the Moon, or under the sea! Just anywhere! Prince, please, don't say such things. Your pain is for me... .. much more painful than death. - Ototachibana. - Yes? Do your eyes tell me the truth? I have disobeyed your aunt when coming after you. That doesn't matter! I will never allow you to leave! Stay with me! You are mine! My wife! Sad melody. The pain hidden in people's hearts... .. is coming out through this melody. My poor soldiers have forgotten what the cheerful music of the Sun is like. They have forgotten what laughing is, and what the shape of our Toyowashihara land really is like. A beautiful morning. Look, white birds! They seem so happy... Because they fly toward the Sky, where there is no sadness. I still cannot believe it, and I don't want to believe it. Kurohiko said that it was my father's order to kill me. Do you believe that? How about returning home? It would not be right going to the East... .. with doubt and hate in my heart. I should return to Yamato! First, I have to speak with my father. Then, I have to know, once and for all, the truth! And then? I will live peacefully with you, in Yamato, as a plebeian. Turn the ship around! Turn it? Where to? To Yamato! But, wouldn't that mean disobeying the Emperor's orders? I don't care! Turn the ship around! Yes! Veer the ships! - Veer the ships! - Veer the ships! Stupendous! Look! What are they? They seem to be a flock of birds of passage. What's happening? But the sea was calm! This is very strange! Row! Don't stop rowing! The first ship has collapsed! The third ship is in danger! No, it is dangerous! Don't move! Prince, I am causing this! Don't move, it is dangerous! Sit down! I was serving the gods, but I broke the sacred vow. That's why the Seagod is mad! What are you saying? Don't move! Princess! My sacrifice will calm the sea. Princess! Prince! Please, be happy! Princess! Princess! Prince, look at the sea! Prince, look at the sea! Prince... The princess... .. has sacrificed herself for me. Princess! Princess! Yakumo. Yes? Is her name Azami? Yes. Are you impatient? Yes, prince, my feet have wings. I understand. I understand... This is the sword that he renamed... .. Sword Grasscutter. The prince said that he was not able to to forget you. And he sends me his sacred sword, to me, who tried to kill him once? Is it true? - Does the prince return? - Yes. Then the Emperor will discover our plot! What will you do? Why have you come to tell me? Because I also want to make a career. Make a career?!... I know that you will reward me as I deserve. I have worked very hard... .. for Yamato Takeru, but he has not repaid me. I understand. You can leave. Please, favor me. Go out and kill Yamato Takeru! Immediately! Listen! Kill Yamato Takeru, as soon as you see him! Also kill all the men who challenge us! But... But what? This is betrayal! We cannot kill our prince! These are orders of the Emperor! Yamato Takeru has returned without permission from the Emperor, therefore he is a traitor! But...! Do you challenge us? Die! Traitors must die! - Look, the mountains of Yamato! - Yamato! How marvelous! Yamato is the most beautiful place on Earth! Behind those mountains, Azami is waiting for me! It is the first time that we all smile! Come to think of it, it has been a long trip, to the land of the Kumaso, and later toward the East. I am happy that you are all alive. I cannot bear it any longer! Prince, please, let's hurry! No, I'm not going back to Yamato. Prince, why do you say that? Continue alone. But, prince... I know. I know how you feel. And will you allow Otomo to escape without punishment? Have you forgotten that fire that almost killed you? You won't return to kill the traitors? You will leave those swines unpunished? That would not solve anything, it would cause more problems. Violence doesn't engender understanding. I have made pacts with many clans in the East without fighting, and I have obtained better results. This advice was given to me by my aunt, by the youngest of the Kumaso brothers. I will go see my aunt at the Ise Sanctuary. If she speaks with my father, maybe he will understand. Prince, I'll go with you! Yes, and me too! Me too! What's that? They take another road! Have they found out? All right, I will follow them. You do as planned! Yes! Someone has called. Oh, Otomo's son! He has come! Attack! Wait! Calm down! Prince, I am very happy you are here. We've come to meet you. What do you want? I'm bringing orders the Emperor's orders. What? From my father? Be happy! You no longer have to fight in the East anymore. They ordered me go to tell you. Really? Is that true? Undoubtedly it is! The Emperor awaits you! If we hurry, we will be there before evening. Come! Yakumo! Protect the prince! Let's go! Let's go, let's go! Yakumo, there's only the two of us? Yes. Don't die! Yakumo, you must not die! You neither! Yakumo, right now there are people in some parts of this country... .. who are being stoned to death. This didn't happen in the old times. Yes, prince. This happens because they don't have your help. I cannot die! But you have also been stoned! Maybe! When I return to Yamato, I will speak with my father and with everybody. We will build a country, like when it was created, where people don't distrust each other, a country filled with strength and joy. Since it has once been like that, why shouldn't it become like that again? Am I not right, Yakumo? Yes! I refuse to die, until everybody sees this miracle! Yakumo! Where's the prince?! It's you! It's Yakumo! Yakumo is back! Yakumo! - Asami. - Yakumo! Look! Such a splendid sight! Asami, everybody, let's follow the white bird! Let's go! Let's go quickly!
