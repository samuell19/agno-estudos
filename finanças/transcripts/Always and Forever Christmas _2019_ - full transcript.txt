Good morning. All of our clients are saying the same thing, that you're a genius. Thank you. Lucy, I'm trying to tell you you've had an incredible year, and when you get back from your trip, we're going to have a serious discussion about your next steps at Rewire. That's amazing. But until then, it's the end of the year, enjoy your vacation. Vacation, I'm leaving tomorrow, two weeks back in my hometown in Vermont. Oh, I thought you mentioned something about Hawaii. Yeah, I'm sending my parents to Maui as a thank you. They really deserve it. They've been putting off their retirement for the past year running the family business, and we finally found a buyer for their store. Technically, it's, it's my store. You own a store? What's it called? Okay, I still need to re-price the snow globes for the store closing sale. Now, did you say they were 25 % off, or was that for the outdoor decor? We already have toys at 40 % off, but are still those toys... Randall. You're right, there's too much to digest right now. Let's talk about this tomorrow. Randall, you don't have to worry. We're sorry that we're leaving at the busiest time of the year, but Lucy will be here to oversee everything. Now, give me that broom. It's only two weeks. We'll see you again on Christmas Eve. I won't let you down. Have a good trip. I'm gonna miss this place. Me too, but your dad left it to Lucy, and she wants to sell. I'm sure he knew what he was doing. He and Lucy had a very special connection. And whatever happens, I know he'll be looking out for us. Hey Mom. Hello, sweetheart. Hey, Lucy Goosey. We just wanted to check in before leaving. Are you sure you're gonna be able to handle everything? You guys, I have huge clients and work 70 hours a week, I think I can handle a Christmas store. Besides, I'm meeting the buyer while I'm in town to sign the paperwork. I think it will be nice to work in the store during Christmas again. But sweetheart, you haven't done that since you were nine years old. And grandpa thought I was good at it even then. Are you sure you guys don't want me to house sit while you're gone? The house will be fine. Okay, okay. You guys have a great trip, and I will see you on Christmas Eve. Love you, sweetheart. See you in two weeks. Love you, too. Hey Goosy, you want to help your grandpa close up the register? Miss? Sorry, we're closed. Oh, um, I'm not a customer. Randall? Yeah, hi there. And you are?I'm Lucy. Oh, yeah, yeah, your, your parents said you were flying in today. Well, it's, it's nice to meet you. I know it'll be good to have an extra hand. Things get pretty crazy here around Christmas. Well, we definitely have our work cut out for us. Buyer is coming in two days to do a walk through and sign the paperwork, so I need everything to run as smoothly as possible. Oh, there we are. Much better. I'm just gonna finish closing up, if that's okay? Of course. Good night, Randall. I'll be upstairs in grandpa's apartment. Miss you grandpa. Where did you come from? Merry Christmas. Oh, thank you, dear, must have blown right off. Oh my, I frightened you. No, it's just... who are you? Oh, of course, where are my manners. I'm Carol, and it's so nice to meet you, Lucy. Here, have a cookie. Well, go ahead, they're freshly baked. Mm, these are really good! Wait, back up, what exactly are you doing here? Well, I'm here to help out with the store. Oh, you're one of the seasonal employees. How did you get in here? I thought I was the only one with the keys. Well, I wanted to make sure that you were welcomed properly. Can't have a traditional Christmas homecoming without cookies and cocoa, now can we? Don't bother with that, it hasn't worked in years. Let's see about that. Huh. Mom and dad must have fixed it. You know, I've been wanting to visit this store for quite a while now. I have some friends back home who talk about it all the time. Really? Where are you from? Oh, a little town up north, middle of nowhere really. My husband is so busy this time of year that it's the perfect opportunity for me to get away. I love experiencing different Christmas traditions and helping people. That's wonderful. What does your husband do? Mostly imports and exports. Well, I'm glad you came and visited, but you do know that we're closing, right? Yes, dear, I know everything, and I know that it'll probably be hard to think about selling it, but I'm certain that everything's gonna be okay. I'm a firm believer in the magic of Christmas. Now you have some cocoa and get to bed, we've got a busy day tomorrow. The store is bound to be full of people trying to find that perfect thing that they can't find anywhere else. Thanks, I'll see you in the morning. Carol? No service, not even WiFi? How is that even possible? Morning Randall. Morning Lucy. That's odd. Carol here, reporting for duty. Oh, dear, I frightened you again. I'm so sorry. Oh, that's just Carol. Apparently your parents hired her before they left. So, you weren't a dream? Oh no, dear, I'm quite real, in the flesh and ready to work. That's... good. Okay, well, we have a lot of work to do. Hopefully, we'll be able to sell all of this stuff before Christmas. I want to drive high foot traffic in here, so that means a big, big push on social media. What's the WiFi situation? I don't see a network.Oh, there's no WiFi here. Excuse me? Yeah, we don't even have a computer. How do you keep track of inventory? You're serious? Mm-hmm. What about the credit cards? Wow! Yeah, your grandpa was old-school. Oh, I think that's so quaint. Being in this store is like stepping back in time. You know, my husband's exactly the same. People keep trying to get him to put his lists on a computer, but he insists on using pen and paper. How did grandpa run the store like this for so long? I don't even have a cell phone signal. How am I supposed to make a phone call? Yeah, that's not gonna work. I'm gonna go find some signal. Okay. Well, I hope she finds what she's looking for. It's up to you and me to spread some Christmas cheer. Good choice.Thank you. That's from the Farmer's Market. It's blackberry. Okay, great. That's quite the setup you've got there. Yes, I am nothing if not all encompassing. Would I be able to get the WiFi code? Yeah, WiFi is for paying customers. Apparently I'm getting coffee. Coffee's free. Great. Well, I appreciate your policy, but I'm sure you can cut me a break, right, or can I talk to a manager or something? You can talk to the owner. That would be lovely. Um. Hi, I'm Scott. I'm the owner. I'll have an egg, poached, please. One egg, big order. By the way, the password is password. Thank you. So you're staying over at Hal's place, right? I saw you go in yesterday with some luggage. I put two and two together. So, Hal was? My grandpa. He was a heck of a guy. Everyone in town loved him. And hey, with your parents still running the store, it's like he's still here. Actually, he left it to me. So, we'll be neighbors. Well, I'm selling it. Oh, to who? To a company called Athletia. They are huge in the Athletia market. I have no idea what that means. Basically, fancy workout clothes. Oh, and people buy this sort of thing? Oh, yeah, back home in LA it's huge. Finally making its way to Vermont. Exactly what we needed. Anyway, it's nice to meet you. Are you gonna be in town for a while? Till Christmas. After that, you'll have your booth back and I'll be long gone. It'll be like we never met. What a shame that would be. Oh, you have got to be kidding me. Hey Lucy. Hey Randall. Sorry, I've been gone for four hours. Yeah, that's okay, we had everything under control. Thank you so much for coming in. Here you go. Oh, and don't forget your cookie. Thank you. Isn't she something? Well, the good news is I found WiFi across the street at the diner. Forever Christmas officially has a social media presence. Aren't we closing in two weeks? Randall, this is my area of expertise, trust me. Putting in a few hours now will payoff with attracting customers. Okay, well I'm just gonna go restock the snow globes. Why don't we ask the owner? Lucy, can you give us a hand? Sure, how can I help? I'd love some help finding a gift. My son just got married and I want to give my new daughter-in-law the perfect Christmas present, and the man who used to own this store was always so good at that. Oh, that was my grandpa. Yes, but she's taken things over now, isn't that lovely? I'll tell you what, why don't you grab a cookie and stay here, we'll be right back. I'm sure Lucy and I can find something perfect. Oh, thank you. We can? Mm-hmm. Oh, look at all this. The store really does have everything. Anything catching your eye, Lucy? No, this really isn't my expertise. Oh, but it's so much fun to find the perfect Christmas treasure. Oh, I'm not here to have fun. Besides, my grandpa was the one that had the gift to help people find what they needed. It's almost like he could just... See what they really need deep down. Yeah, exactly. Well maybe that runs in the family. I don't think so. Hmm. Something wrong? Oh, no, I'm fine. So, any ideas? Um, no, I guess not. Wait, what about this? Oh, well, I'm certain that this is the one. It's perfect. My family collects nutcrackers from all over the world, and this will be my daughter-in-law's first Christmas away from home in Ireland.Oh. How in the world did you know? Well, I never would have found it if Lucy hadn't led me straight to it. You have no idea how much this means. Oh, I'm gonna miss this store. I can barely imagine Main Street without it, but what a great way to say goodbye. Thanks, again! Merry Christmas. Carol, did you? Did I what? No, think I'm just jet-lagged. Oh, why don't you go upstairs and rest. Randall and I can handle things down here. Actually, I'm gonna go for a walk. Even better. Yes, go see the town and get some fresh air. Great idea. Here, let me help you, dear. You sure you don't mind? Oh, of course not, you go. Lucy, first day on the job and already spreading Christmas magic. I love this store. Hello. Hi Lucy, it's Greg Peters from Athletia. Oh, hi Greg. I just found out I'm stuck in Chicago. Apparently, winter storm Megan came out of nowhere, and, well, I'm not flying anywhere. Oh, okay, so we're not meeting tomorrow? Unfortunately, no. And I hate to say it, but tomorrow was the only window I had. Honestly, I might not be able to get there till closer to Christmas. I'm really sorry. No, no, it's, it's not your fault. It's not you can change the weather. I was just hoping that we would be able to wrap this up as soon as possible. Lucy, I promise you, don't worry, this deal is going through, okay. Okay. Thanks for understanding. I know this isn't ideal, but I'll see you soon. And hey, look at this way, at least now you can focus on enjoying your Christmas back home, right. Right, I think I will. Have a good night, Greg. Thank you for coming out, everyone! As Mayor of Stowe, it is my honor to kick off one of our town's most beloved annual traditions, here at the Old Town Square. Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you the Twelve Days of Christmas! I would also like to say thank you to Forever Christmas for donating all of the ornaments we're going to be hanging over the next 12 days. Now, Scott, if you would do the honors. Absolutely. Thank you, Mayor. ♪♪ On the first day of Christmas my true love gave to me a partridge in a pear tree. ♪♪ Wonderful! Now, let's gather around and ring in the occasion with some hot cider! A diner owner and tree decorator. Impressive, right. I'm glad you made it out. Yeah, I figured I'd check out some of the local festivities. And what did you think? Mm, caught my interest. Well wait till day 10 when you get to see yours truly as a lord a leaping in a very tasteful costume. Do you want to grab some cider? I'd love to, but I should probably get back to the store. Oh, well, I'll walk you back. I forgot something at the diner, anyway. Oh, okay.Yeah? Yeah. Thanks for walking me back tonight. I actually had a good time. Wow, what a compliment. Oh, actually if you lift up on the handle and turn the key. Your grandpa showed me this trick. Here. Huh, look at that. Well, um, I should. Yeah, me too. Good night. Good night, Lucy. But it doesn't really fly, right? Well sure it does. How, it doesn't have wings? It doesn't need wings. Santa's sleigh is pulled by magic reindeer. What, you don't believe in magic? No, do you? Absolutely. And do you want to know a secret? This store is full of magic. It is? The store talks to me, and if I listen really close, I always find what I'm looking for, and wouldn't you call that magic? Yeah. Him ♪] Morning Randall.Morning. Morning Lucy. Carol. What do you think? Look at this, it's great. How long did this take? Oh, it was nothing. My husband I do crafts together all the time. You must miss him being away at the holidays. Oh, I do miss the silly old dear, but he's so busy at Christmas, and it's my chance to get away and try to do some good. Speaking of which, I was talking to a few of the customers, and they told me that Forever Christmas often plays a big part in the town's holiday activities. Carol, I see what you're trying to do here, but we have our hands full trying to sell off our inventory. It just doesn't make sense to sign up for Christmas activities, too. Doesn't make sense to spread the magic of Christmas? It makes sense to me. You sound like my grandpa. Well then your grandpa was a very wise man. Sure, but he was also a little eccentric. I mean he did run a year round Christmas store. Because of him I believed in all that Christmas magic stuff way longer than I should have. Good morning. Morning Randall. Here's your mail. Great, thanks. So, crazy weather we're having, huh? Actually, it's really nice out there. Is it? Well that, that is, that is very nice. I think a customer needs me, so I'm gonna actually head back. Okay, okay. I'll see you tomorrow. Okay. Bye.Bye. Ah, young love. Well, I'm gonna go get coffee. Are you off to the diner? Well, say hi to Scott for me. He makes a mean cup of cocoa. And he's awfully cute, too, don't you think? Oh, we are definitely not having this conversation right now. Bye. How's it going across the street? Pretty good. At the moment, I'm working on bringing Forever Christmas into the 21st Century. What's that? It's a web site I'm building for the store. Isn't it a little late in the game to be creating a web site? Why does everybody keep saying that? This is my job. I know what I'm doing. Oh, I guess us small town folk have a hard time grasping what a big city gal like you gets up to. Okay, that is not what I meant. Besides, you can't hold that card, I'm from here. You are? I was raised here until I was nine, went to Little Creek Elementary School up into the fourth grade, then we moved.You went to Little Creek? I wonder if we played kickball together. Ah, you would remember, I was the kickball queen. You ever thought about moving back? No, not really. Don't get me wrong, this place is charming, but my whole life's in LA.Yeah, I get it. It must feel kind of quaint for you now. But that's what I like about this place. People like your grandpa and his store, they made this town feel special. You don't get that just any other place. Anyway, I should get back to it. I know you're gonna be busy wrapping things up and everything, but if you wanted to see how the town's changed over the years, maybe I could show you around. Maybe I'll take you up on that. Hi Lucy. Hard at work I see. Honestly, I feel useless without my laptop. It's been a long time since I worked retail. Yes, I'm sure a lot has changed since you worked here as a kid with your grandpa. Hm, not too much. Wait, how did you know that? Randall must have mentioned it. Excuse me, can one of you help me? Sure. Carol here would be happy to assist you. I don't know, I think the family magic for finding gifts is in your blood. The only thing in my blood is a surplus of caffeine. Yes, I would be happy to help. I need a Christmas gift for my mom. Okay, what are you thinking? I don't know, but I want something special. All right, well that's not too much information, but let's give it a shot. What about a teddy bear phone case? Nothing says I care like safeguarding your loved one's belongings. No, not so much. Okay, point taken. Carol, why don't you take over? Nonsense, you're doing great. Okay, not great, but you're getting close, I can feel it. Just think, try to tap into that family gift. Okay, come along. How about this? She does love books. Think this is the right gift? Mm-hmm. I'll take it. Excellent, come along, dear, I'll ring you up. I knew you had it in you. Maybe I do. Lucy? Oh, hey Randall. Have you ever felt anything strange in the store when you're helping a customer find a gift, something that's pointing you in the right direction? Are you okay? Yeah, no, yeah, I'm fine. Just forget I said anything. Okay. Thanks for your help. Oh, of course, Merry Christmas, and if there's anything else you need, we will be right here. Actually, there is one thing. I was thinking what would make this gift really special is if you chose it for this month's story nook. Oh, and what is a story nook? It's a book reading. The store does one every month, and December is the best one. There's treats, cocoa, and pillows on the floor and everything.That sounds lovely. And do you want someone to read the book that you got for your mom? No, I want you to read it. Oh, isn't that a wonderful idea, don't you think? Yeah, your parents kept it going after they started running this place. Everyone in town loves it. And exactly when does something like this take place? It's supposed to be later today. Oh, really? But in a last word to the wise of these days, let it be said that all who give gifts, these two were the wisest. Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they are the wisest, everywhere they are the wisest, they are the magi. Thanks everyone for coming, and thank you to my friend, Mae, for helping choose such a very special book. Excuse me, you're Lucy, right? Mm-hmm. I'm Mae's mom, Angela. It's nice to meet you. Thank you for putting this on. Mae comes to the story nook every month, and I was so happy when she told me you were doing it today. I'm just glad that we could spread Christmas joy. Oh, that reminds me, this is from your daughter, The Gift of the Magi. Well, I used to have a book just like this one. My mom read it to me every Christmas when I was a girl. I never thought I'd find anything else like it, but here it was. And now I get to read it to Mae and some day she can read it to her kids, too. Oh, thank you so much! You know, I don't know if you realize just how special this place is. I think I'm starting to. Merry Christmas, Angela. Merry Christmas, Mae. Merry Christmas, Lucy. Wow, look at this place. It's so busy. I know. Who knew that this would bring in so much business. Maybe your grandpa was onto to something all those years. I couldn't agree more. Hi, I'm Carol and you're Scott, right? Yes. Yes, Lucy's mentioned you.You have? No, I haven't. What a turnout. I don't think it could have gone better. Doesn't it feel good to spread Christmas cheer? Actually, it does. Now, you do know there are other events Forever Christmas usually takes part in. You know, Carol, for a first time seasonal employee, you sure do know a lot about this store. Well, I just listen to things that people say, and since I knew you would enjoy this one, I did sort of kind of sign us up to participate in more events. Excuse me? I know the store is closing and you want to focus on that, but Scott, Scott, isn't all this wonderful? I mean look at it all. I'll admit I'm having fun. Why don't you ride that feeling a little bit more. You said it felt good to spread Christmas joy. All right, what do you have in mind? I took the liberty of volunteering us to help with the Snow Ball. The Snow Ball? The Snow Ball. That still happens? Yeah, it's only the most important event of the year. It's pretty much mandatory to go. I never miss it. That's good to hear because I signed you up to help us. You did what? Yeah, we'll deal with the specifics later. Oh, I've got to help some customers. Why don't we talk over dinner? Oh wait, um, like, the three of us? Well, of course, why not? I'll make a reservation and let you know where. Carol. ♪] Hey. Hey. You look nice. Thanks, so do you. Are we at the right restaurant? This is not exactly what I was picturing for a brainstorming session. Yeah, Carol picked it. Um, I have definitely been here on a first few dates before. Oh, is this a date? Oh, no, no, I, I just, I meant because of the, the vibe and everything. You're messing with me. Good evening, I'm Wade. I'll be looking after you tonight. I'll give you a minute with the menus. Oh, we're actually waiting on someone else. Oh, Carol, right, yeah, she just called. Looks like she can't make it. Oh. It kind of seems like we've been set up. So, what do you want to do? Well, we could have dinner together like two normal people. Can you manage that? Yeah, I can try my best. Are you ready to order? Oh, I'm, I'm sorry, we actually haven't even looked at the menu. Um, but, in the meantime, could you bring us two glasses of sparkling cider? Sure. Thank you. So, Lucy, tell me something about yourself, standard talk. Do you have siblings? No, only child, you? Yes, one brother, Matt. And where is Matt? Did he settle down in Stowe as well? No, no, no, he, he left town as soon as he could. He's been all over the place. He's been in London for the last few years, and he's probably gonna go to Japan or something like that next, knowing him. Wow, he's quite the globetrotter. You see him much? We talk on the phone, yeah, but it's hard for him to come out here with work and traveling and everything. He doesn't come home, not even for Christmas? Not really, no. Christmas was a family thing, and ever since my father died. Oh, Scott, I'm sorry. No, no, it's, it's fine, it was a long time ago. But I guess there's just nothing left anchoring him here, um, but I do miss celebrating with him. Have you tried asking him to come home for Christmas? No. Maybe you should. Um, thank you. I have an idea. Okay.Let's talk about something fun, but first I would like to propose a toast. Welcome back home, Lucy Simmons. And though your stay may be brief, may it be a reminder of all of the magic and charm that a small town at Christmas can have. Cheers to that. Really, your entire life, the furthest you've been is Arizona? Yeah. When I was 10, the big family trip to the Grand Canyon. My brother pretty much ruined the whole vacation when he threw my favorite toy right off the cliff. That was a, a long ride home. Oh. Your next vacation you should come to California. I don't know. With the, the beautiful weather and the food and the culture, is there really anything there for me? There's a big world out there, Scott. You never know what you might miss if you don't go out and see it. That's true. But there's something to be said about a town like this and, and remembering where you're from. I mean you can feel the magic, can't you? Yeah, when I was a kid. What happened? I grew up, I moved away, I got a job that I loved, and an exciting city. Well, I guess your parents are still here, so you can always visit for Christmas. Yeah, well, mom and dad want to move back to California and retire. So, once we don't have to run the store anymore. You won't really need to come back. No, I won't. Being back is great and I could feel something, but. Have you ever considered not selling the store? It's not that simple. I know everybody loves the store, but how can I take care of it when I'm all the way across the country? I'm sorry, you know what, you're right, it's not really my business. I guess I'm just bummed that I didn't meet you sooner. You know what? We should really take advantage of all of Stowe's Christmas traditions while you're still here. Come on, I want to show you something. Come on. Come on.All right. So, they just stand here all night? Pretty much. Scott, so good to see you. You know, we could use another wise man in a couple of days when Terry visits his in-laws. Hey, Scott, you'd make a great wise man. I will get back to you on that. But in the meantime, if you're looking for a replacement Mary, I think Lucy would love to volunteer. Oh, Lucy, Hal's granddaughter, right? It's a treat that you're running the store for its last Christmas. I think I speak for everyone here when I say we're going to miss it. I just don't know where I'm gonna buy my wreaths next year. Sorry to let you down, Mary. Oh, evening service is letting out. Okay, well, I guess we better get back to it. It was wonderful to meet you. You too. Okay, everybody, back into character. ♪ Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells, jungle all the way. ♪ ♪ Oh what fun it is... Good morning.Good morning yourself. You're usually not this bushy tailed until your third cup of coffee. Can't a girl be filled with Christmas spirit without getting the third degree? Look, if youon't want to admit it, that's fine, but I can't help but notice you being so chipper after spending an evening with yours truly. Oh-ho-ho, is that what you think? That's very flattering for you, but that has nothing to do with it. I'm serious. Okay, whatever you say. However, I will admit that maybe you were right about being back in Stowe. It's kind of rubbing off on me, all of this wintry charm, the story nook, getting ready for the ball, it's... Magical. ...fulfilling. I want to do more. Well, I think you'll get your chance. New project, I need your help. Come on, Scott, you too. It's all hands on deck. An ornament raffle, this is such a cute idea. I remember my grandpa talking about this. People come to the store, buy an ornament to bring to the Ball. Well, Forever Christmas is the perfect place to display them. Hey, Rose. Hi everyone. Hey Randall. Hey.What you got there? Oh, what, this, oh, it's nothing. I mean it is, it is something, it's something. What was the question? These are for the ornament raffle. I love the ornament raffle. I'll take one, please. Thanks. Great, well, here you go.Thanks. Great, well, I've got some stuff to do, so I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go do that stuff. I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go do that stuff. I'll see you at the Snow Ball. Thanks for this. Good luck, dear. Okay, Randall, she's gone. Is it super obvious that I like Rose? Yeah, you could say that. How can we help you, dear? I don't know what's wrong. Every time I see her I just get so nervous. Honestly, all I want for Christmas this year is just to go out with her, just one date. Um, I can't explain it, but... I think this is for you. For me? Yeah, I just have a feeling. Well, go ahead, take it, you never know you might win and wouldn't that be wonderful? Yeah, I guess it couldn't hurt. Thanks Lucy. So, should we finish putting this on the tree? That was very nice of you. Thanks, I took your advice, went with my instinct. Well, like grandfather like granddaughter. You were very wise to trust yourself. Yeah, feels good. It's nice to see you getting into the holiday spirit, dear. Lucy. Hey Carol, come on in. Getting ready for the big night I see. Yeah, but I don't know. I'm not really feeling this dress. When I was packing for this trip, I didn't anticipate going to a formal Christmas Ball. Well life is just full of surprises, isn't it? Although some of them are quite wonderful. Wait a minute, I've got just the thing. Carol, please tell me you didn't. Now don't start with the fuss, it's just a little something I had packed away because you never know. Oh, Carol, this is beautiful. Thank you. You're welcome. Well, come on, let's try it on. ♪♪] Wow, you look... Thanks, you clean up well yourself. Um, technically I know we're here as volunteers, but traditionally you're supposed to bring a date, so I brought you this. I think I'm supposed to help you put it on. Thank you, it's beautiful. Can I get you some punch? Please. Hi Lucy, good to see you again. Terry, right, one of the wise men? I'm gonna miss your store. Christmas in July was always my favorite event of the year. Christmas in July? My grandpa never told me about that. I'm sure there's a lot he did to help the town we never knew about, just the kind of guy he was. Just wanted to let you know while I had the chance. You two enjoy yourselves. Thanks Terry. I thought I lost you for a second there, but now I see you've found my favorite spot, the chocolate fountain. Oh yeah? Here you go. Thanks. Yeah, you better drink that fast, I just bumped into Mayor Wilson, he's about to introduce us. Ladies and gentlemen, it's the moment that you've all been waiting for, the ornament raffle! Please help me welcome to the stage, your hosts for this evening, Lucy Simmons and Scott Jensen! I guess we should get up there. Good evening everyone! I'm Hal's granddaughter, Lucy, for those of you who don't know me. My grandpa Hal ran Forever Christmas for almost 50 years, and I had the pleasure of helping him when I was a little girl. Although my grandpa left me the store, my parents have been kind enough to keep his legacy going, and now I'm lucky to do the same for the store's final Christmas! So, let's get this party started! I'll take the mike. Hey everybody, are we excited? Yeah, welcome back this year. Let's do the first draw, and the winner is number 18. I won! Hi, fantastic. On the tree, yes, let's see what you got. It looks like a free spa day at Escape Spa on Second Street. Congratulations. All right, everyone, we are down to the final number. Get those ornaments ready. Thank you. And the winner is number 32. I won! Everyone, it is Forever Christmas's own Randall. I, I think there's been a mistake. I got 32 as well. That can't be right. Well, everyone, it looks like we have two winners. Let's just hope that prize is something they can both enjoy. We are in luck, it is dinner for two at Pasquale's. It is a Christmas miracle. Would you like to? Yes. That brings an end to the raffle. Merry Christmas everyone. Now, let's dance. Yeah. What's wrong? I, I just could have sworn we didn't have any repeat numbers. Happens to the best of us. I wouldn't worry about it. Unless you rigged it for another Christmas wish. So, are you ready to check out my sweet dance moves? Oh, there is nothing I'd like to see more. ♪♪ O holy night the stars are brightly shining ♪ ♪ It is the night of our dear Savior's birth ♪ ♪ O fall on your knees ♪ O hear the angels' voices ♪ O night O night divine So, the Snow Ball, was it everything you imagined as a girl?

Oh, I was working on this display and I guess I lost track of time. How was the Ball? Oh, it was beautiful. Getting dressed up, dancing in the snow. Hmm, I bet Scott looked very handsome in his suit. Yeah, he really did. Although I may have gotten a little too carried away, we almost... Oh. Wait, did you have anything to do with the mistletoe outside? Mistletoe, oh, I don't know the first thing about it. But it wouldn't have been the end of the world, would it? No, it wouldn't have been the worse thing, but it would have been pretty inconvenient given the time. I mean I leave in less than a week, and the last thing I need to do is fall in love. Love? I didn't mean. It's just that I live so far away from here, I just can't be getting involved. Besides, I don't even know if he thinks of me like that. Well, I think he thinks of you like that. In fact, I think he's fairly smitten with you, and I can't think of a better time to fall in love than Christmas. Oh, speaking of the time, oh, my goodness, it's late, I've got to go. All right, do we a favor, dear, and turn out the lights, lock up, and get to bed, we've got a busy day tomorrow. Okay, thanks, Carol. You should have kissed her. Lucy. Matt. Merry Christmas, brother. So you couldn't have told me you were coming like a normal person? I was already in Montreal for work when I got your message, and I figured, hey, why not just drive down and surprise him. Well, I'm glad you did. It's been a while since I've been able to celebrate Christmas with my little brother. Mm, oh, you know, this is almost as good as when dad used to make them. Almost, if that's the way you feel. No, no, no, no, all right, all right, Iake it back, okay. That's what I thought. Cheers. Hey, I'm glad you could come. Sorry, I tried to get here as fast as I could. Carol said you needed my help with something. Yeah, I, I know it's last minute, um, but before we get started, I wanted to talk to you about, um, last night before we left. Hey, there you are, hi. Dude, this place is amazing. You have to try the glazed turkey leg. Hello Matt. Hi, I'm Matt, I'm the younger, less grumpy brother. There we go. Hi Matt, Lucy. Nice to finally meet you. It's great that you're able to get here for Christmas. Yeah, no, I was close by for work when Scott called me and asked me to come down, and I thought why not. Oh, Scott invited you? How sweet. So, what did I miss? Not much. Scott was about to tell me something about last night. Oh, it's nothing, yeah. Oh, okay, well, what could I help you with? This is really important, follow me. You too, come on, Matt. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on, I need a partner, and you already said you would help. You said that this was important. It is important. I have a title to defend, and Matt is the worst at this game, no offense. Okay, wow, no, he's, he's right, I am the worst. This is the oldest town tradition, and besides, you've already got it in your blood. Your grandpa and I have the longest running record, eight Christmas's in a row, eight. Come on, do it for him, and also me. And for me. All right, if my family's honor's at stake, what choice do I have? Yeah, let's go sign up! Okay. Welcome everyone to the great Christmas Pudding Toss. Each team gets 15 seconds to toss as many Christmas puddings to their partner as they can. The team with the most in their baskets at the end is the winner. Three, two, one, go! Five seconds left! Oh-ho-ho-ho. Looks like we have a winner! Yes! Thanks Scott, I had such a great time. Me too. Well, it's nice meeting you, Matt. Welcome home. Maybe I'll see you around. I don't doubt that you will. Bye.Bye. Wow, she's really something. Isn't she? So, what happened last night? What do you mean? Lucy said you wanted to ask her something, and then you were all too eager not to say anything in front of me, so what did you do? Oh, you asked her out, didn't you, and you totally got shutdown. No, nothing happened, all right. I don't even know why we're having this conversation. Cause it's obvious.What is? Wait, is it? Oh yeah, and you need to do something about that. Like what though? It's already too late. She's selling her store and moving back to LA after Christmas. That's great, then you have nothing to lose. It's almost Christmas, so she goes back to her life and your life goes back to normal, or you win her over and then who knows.It's not that easy. Yes, it is. Just ask her out. Do something romantic, otherwise you're always gonna wonder if she feels the same way, right? Here you go. I'm so glad we got a chance to stop in one last time before you close. We've been coming here for 40 years, had ourselves a good run. Well, I am glad you came in one last time. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas.Merry Christmas. Ohhh. Hey.How do I look? So, so handsome. Are you excited for your date with Rose? Very. You know, I still don't know how you did it, Lucy. Did what? Gave us both the winning numbers. Yeah, I don't know how I did it either. I've been trying to work up the courage to ask her out for years now. So, however you did it, thank you. Well, I guess I should head over there. Wish me luck. Good luck.Good luck. Lucy, you okay? Oh, yeah, just thinking about all the people who told me they're sad the store is closing. I think it's sweet. A lot of people are gonna miss this place. Yeah, I know. When I first got here, I was ready to sell, move on, rip it off quick like a band aid, but now spending time here during Christmas, I just feel like I shouldn't have ever come back. Well, I for one am very glad that you came back. It gave you a chance to see the place again, and you'll have those memories forever. You look tired. Why don't you go sit down and I'll make us some cocoa. Oh, Carol, it's fine. Why don't you go home, I'll close up the store. Nonsense, nonsense, I'm not going anywhere. Go on, on with you. Something on your mind, dear? I remember the last time I was here. My parents told me we were moving to California, and I was inconsolable. Grandpa wanted to cheer me up. He said he was going to give me a present, something to remind me of him and the store, of the magic. It was like he pulled it out of thin air, this beautiful toy, in that moment I believed. I slept with that horse for years, but life goes on, and eventually the horse was just gone. I guess we have to grow up at some point. Oh, my dear, the magic of Christmas is something we never outgrow. Lucy, you here? Lucy, Greg Peters. I'm sorry for the wait, but how about we sign some paperwork? The space up here is perfect. Got big plans, juice bar in the kitchen, and the living room will make a lovely yoga studio, and that leaves the entire first floor for more merchandise. Man, your grandpa was really crazy about Christmas, huh? Yeah, he was, that's why this is hard for me. The holidays weren't really a big deal at my house growing up. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Oh, no, no, no, it's fine. Just we were never really all that sentimental. I can remember the exact moment I stopped caring about Christmas. I was seven, opening presents Christmas morning, and I had asked my parents for only one thing that year, the only thing in the whole world that I really wanted. What did you ask for? Doesn't matter, I didn't get it. So from that point on, Christmas just didn't hold the same... Magic. ...magic, right. Well, maybe Santa just didn't have time to get to my house that year. I thought you could use some refreshments. Oh, how nice, thanks. You know, Lucy was just telling me how hard it is to let the store go, weren't you, dear? Yeah, I was so sure before, but I... People always have second thoughts when it comes time to sign, but once they do, it's huge relief. And once we're done here, you can go back to your life in LA, right? Oh, oh, shoooot, I am sorry. Oh my, it spilled all over the paperwork. I guess you'll have to come back tomorrow. No, not to worry, I will clean this right up. Here we go. What did you trip on? Huh, that's odd. Oh, oh! Oh, close call. It's almost like someone doesn't want this deal to go through. Can we just reschedule? No, no, no, it's all good, we can sign. Here you go. One more. Well, I guess I'm doing this. Great. I will just tuck these safely away before anything else happens. All right then, you should have the money wired before the end of the week. This is delicious. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Did I do the right thing, Carol? Only you can know that. I mean it's not up to me, or your grandfather, or anybody else. I know you did what you thought was right, and I know that it was hard, and usually the right thing isn't easy. Here, they're freshly baked. Scott, what are you doing? Why are you throwing snowballs at my window in the middle of the night? First of all, it's 11 o'clock, so that's a stretch. Second of all, I have a good reason. I have something to show you. Now? Yes, and I think you're gonna like it. Okay, I could use a little bit of cheering up. Good, let's go. Wow! What is going on here? ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ 'Tis the season to be jolly ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ ♪ Don we now our gay apparel ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la ♪ Troll the ancient Yule-tide carol ♪ ♪ Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la ♪ So, I thought a picnic would be nice, but then I realized that it was nighttime in Vermont in the winter, so I had to improvise. Scott, this is beautiful. Who is this all for? Well, see, I know that we just met not that long ago, and that there was always a time limit on how long that you were gonna stay out here for, but do you really have to go? You keep talking about how great it is to be back here, and how much you love the store and how you're gonna miss it, so do you really have to sell it? Yeah, my whole life is in Los Angeles. There's, there's one here, too, though. You have the store, the whole community. Even if you were to go back to California, you still don't have to sell it. Of course, I do, my parents, they want... They can still retire, you just have to hire someone to handle things while you're away, everything can work itself out. I sold the store. What? I just finished signing the paperwork. This wasn't easy for me, Scott. I understand. I didn't ask for this. I don't know what my grandpa was thinking when he left me the store. He was probably thinking you loved it as much as he did. Yeah, when I was a little girl, but I can't rearrange my entire life because of it. I should go. Wait, Lucy! This was, um, really lovely, but, um, I'm sorry. So, she just walked out? Yup.Oh, I'm so sorry, man. Yeah, me too. But, hey, at least you took that chance and you told Lucy how you feel about her, right? Well. You didn't tell her. How could she not know? Okay, no offense or anything, but you're not the best at telling people how you feel. Okay, well, anyway, it's too late, and I wouldn't exactly know what to say. Tell her not to leave. You fight for her. Be honest with her. That's what you'd do. Yeah, well, maybe it's time you start taking advice from your little brother. All right, it's Christmas Eve, and I want to get out of here. Hurry up. Thank you. Well, should we call it a day? Yeah, I don't think we're gonna have any more customers. Why don't you go home? I just wanted to say thank you. You made the last Christmas here wonderful, and though we only worked together a short while, just know that it was an honor serving under you. Thanks Randall. I wish I could have gotten to know you better. Yeah, I'm a pretty complex guy. Merry Christmas, Lucy. Merry Christmas. Bye Carol. Merry Christmas, dear. Lucy, how are you? I'm okay. I figure I'm only here for a couple of more days, so I can either spend them suffering, wondering if I made the right decision, or I could spend them spreading Christmas magic like my grandpa would have done. Now that's the spirit. Hey Lucy. Hey Matt. Oh, wow, are you still open? I think we can squeeze one more customer in.Thank you. I could really use some help finding a Christmas gift. It's for Scott. This is the first Christmas we've spent together in a long time, and I really want to find him something special. Heard you might be able to help me out with that. Okay, well, come on, let's go find you something special. Okay, fair warning, this is not gonna be easy. Scott is a very hard man to shop for. I think we can find him something. This is unbelievable. I think he might really like this. No way. Lucy, this is perfect. I can't believe he told you that story. What story? The Grand Canyon and me throwing his favorite toy into it when we were kids. This is the toy? Yeah, no, he used to look through one of these all the time. He never would let anybody else look through it. It's probably why I threw it in there in the first place. This is perfect. How much do I owe you? Oh, please, no, it's on the house. Oh, no, I couldn't. As Forever Christmas's final customer. Really? You know, Scott was right about you, you are magical. Merry Christmas, Matt. Merry Christmas, Lucy. What are you doing there, dear? What? Oh, ah, my horse. Grandpa, has this been here all along? There has to be something that we can do. I've made a huge mistake. Lucy, I'm sorry, there are a lot of moving pieces, I can't back out. Look, selling a family business is hard, especially in a charming town like this. In fact, I decided to stay an extra day just to take in the sights. Found a great B&B just outside of town till I fly out tonight. You don't understand. ♪ Twelve drummers drumming Sorry, I missed that. These twelve drummers drumming are really loud. When I signed the papers, I didn't realize what I was doing. The store is special. I'm sure it feels that way, but I mean once you're back in your old life and you get that nice big check. I don't care about the money. Please. Oh, don't make me the bad guy. Look, I'm sorry you're having second thoughts, but the time to change your mind is past. Just give it time, and soon enough you'll come to see that this the best thing for everyone. Whoa, whoa, wait, hold on, one- Now you take care, okay, and Merry Christmas. Lucy, you okay? Carol, it's real. What is? The magic that my grandpa always spoke about, it's actually real. This is the gift that he gave me when I moved, the one that I lost. Oh, so beautiful. How did it get here? I don't know how this all works, but I do know that this store gives people what they need. I didn't want to believe it because I thought it was crazy. But there's magic in the store. Yes, I know, dear. You do? I told you that when we first met. I've always been a firm believer in the magic of Christmas, and now so are you. Yes, I am. But now it's too late. Hey Scott. Hey. What's going on? Just a little cleaning. You expecting the health inspector or something? I'm stressed, and when I'm stressed I clean, and since the diner is closed, I figured now is a good time. This have anything to do with Lucy? What about Lucy? Yeah, I saw her this morning. I can see why everyone's gonna miss her and the store. She, she really has a gift. What's that? Merry Christmas. Matt. And he's not even gonna wait until Christmas. Matt. Yeah, I just thought you might get a kick out of it, yeah. I'm sorry it took me this long to invite you back home. I'm sorry, too, for not offering to come back here sooner. I miss having my brother in my life. Me too. Let me show you something. You were too young to remember this, but that year on my birthday, dad got me a couple of custom picture wheels. These were all pictures he took of us at Christmas. And this is what you were playing with all that time? Yeah. Oh, man, and I, I just threw it away. Wow, I can't believe you kept this after all those years. Of course I did. I love having you as my brother, even when you annoy me. I'm sorry I let us drift apart. I'm sorry, too. What do you say from now on we spend Christmas together like those two kids. Yeah, I'd like that. On one condition, you need to talk to Lucy. I don't think Lucy wants to talk to me. Oh, Scott, she's leaving, and I get the impression she's not too happy about it. So if you're not gonna tell her how you feel, don't you at least want to say goodbye. How could I let this happen? My Grandpa tried to tell me, and I just stopped believing. I feel like I'm letting everybody down. Lucy, you found the magic again, isn't that what your grandpa wanted? Sure, now it's going away and it's all my fault. Oh, honey, it will never go away, not really. You will always have it in your heart, and the people in town will keep it alive in their memories forever. A place like this has a lot of impact, and you may think the memories will fade over time, but they won't, they will always be with us, just like your grandpa will always be with you. You really think so? I do, and I have celebrated a lot of Christmas's in my life, and I know the real deal when I see it. I know things are tough right now, but I promise whatever happens, it'll be okay. Just remember. It's a shame Greg doesn't care about Christmas, because if he did, he'd see how special this place is and let me keep it. Well, why don't you show him? He did say he's still in town, but even if I wanted to, how would I get him to the store? Oh, you leave that to me, dear. It's Christmas Eve. Don't you need to go back home? Oh, don't you worry about me. That old husband of mine has more than enough help at the office tonight. Besides, I have my own work to do. Hi, how are ya? Good, and you? Good thanks. So about how long till we get to the airport? It's about 45 minutes to Burlington. Okay. Huh, that's weird, it looks like it's gonna be a bit longer. What's wrong? Just got an update, the highway is closed. All the roads are iced over. Looks like we got to cut through town. All right. Thank you. What's wrong? I don't know, engine just died. We're not going anywre. Greg, what a nice surprise to see you still here. Ah, car trouble. Yes, actually. How did you... There's no point in you standing out here in the cold. Come on in the store and I'll make you a cocoa. Lucy, look who I found just outside. Greg. Hi. Hi.Well, I'll let you two catch up. I'll just go and make us some cocoa. I just keep dropping in on you, don't I? I hope you don't mind, I had some trouble on the way to the airport. Oh, no, no, it's fine. Have a look around, although there's not really much left.Yeah. From the looks of things, you had a pretty good final season. Yeah, I'm just happy I was able to help people find what they needed. Speaking of which, is there anything on your Christmas list I could help you find. Oh, no, thank you. No, I told you I haven't had a Christmas list since I was seven. Well, maybe it's not too late to find that perfect present you want. What? Come on. What's going on? Greg, I know what it's like to forget the magic of Christmas, but recently I was reminded, and maybe I can help remind you, too. I think I have the perfect present, something that you've been wanting since you were seven years old. How would you know that? It's the magic of the shop. Oh. I, I don't understand. I, this is exactly the kind of dog I always wanted. How is this possible? How did you? The store talks to me. If I listen really closely and follow my instinct, I will always find what I'm looking for. Wouldn't you call that magic? Oh, what an adorable little pup. Come have some cocoa you two. There's a tow truck outside. I'm afraid your car is gonna be a while. Okay, she's coming, get ready. ♪ Silent night I'm not sure if that's my tow truck. ♪ Holy night ♪ All is calm, all is bright Scott, what is all of this? I didn't want you going home without a proper goodbye, one that you and the store both deserve. You did all of this? Hey, all I did was ask for help. I guess the word kind of caught on like wildfire. All these people came out tonight to show you just how much the store has touched their lives. This is incredible! I don't know what to say, except I'm sorry. I forgot how much this store meant to me. If I could have just remembered how special, important and magical the store is, I would have never let it go. If I can ask for forgiveness and thank you for letting this store be a part of your lives. Lucy, we're the ones who want to thank you. Because of you, I was able to get my mom the perfect Christmas gift. Thank you for helping us welcome a new addiction to our family. And for helping me take a chance on love. Me too. And thank you for helping me find my way back home. And for getting me my brother back. I'm gonna miss all of you. Huh, this is the best Christmas I could have asked for. I'm so sad to say goodbye. Lucy, um, there's no need for that. I'm still not sure what's happening here, but I do know this town needs your store. Are you saying? Yeah, the deal is off. You should probably let them know. The deal is off! Forever Christmas is staying open! Merry Christmas, Lucy. ♪] So, what made you change your mind about the store? It's hard to explain. Sorry, excuse me. Lucy, what's going on? Mom, dad, hi. Welcome back. What are all these people doing here? You won't believe it, I'm keeping the store. You are? But I don't understand. I know, it's been a crazy couple of weeks. Honestly, I don't know how I could have gotten through it without Randall and Carol. Um. Wait, where is Carol? Who's Carol? Carol, the seasonal employee you hired to help run the store. We didn't hire anyone. But Randall said, I'll be right back. Okay. Carol. Carol? Lucy, I'm so proud of you for finding your magic again. I don't think you'll need my help anymore, but know that I'll always be here in spirit. Thank you for making my Christmas truly magical. Love Carol. Hi. Honey, we're so happy you decided to keep the store open. Your grandpa would be so proud. Thanks. Oh, I'm, I'm sorry. I, I could come back later. Don't be silly, Scott, come on in. We were just leaving. We'll see you at the house tomorrow morning, right? Of course. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, Lucy. Merry Christmas. I still don't understand what made you change your mind about the store, but whatever it was, I'm glad you did. You wouldn't believe me if I told you. So, what does this mean? I don't know, I'm still trying to figure that part out. Whatever you decide, there's something I want to tell you. I'm crazy about you, Lucy. From the first moment I saw you it was, like, I could see what was missing in my life sitting right across from me, and I know you have another life waiting for you, but I now realize that all I want is to be part of that life, too, whatever that means. You do? I love you, Lucy. I love you, too. Oh, that was... Magical. Thank you for coming in and Merry Christmas. All right, I better get back at it. Neither rain nor snow and all that. See you tonight? See you tonight. Hey. Hey, welcome back you two! Good to be back. Okay, let me see it. Oh! Oh, I can't wait to hear about everything. But first, duty calls. Talk later? Yeah. So, how was the flight? It was fine. Did you know it's 75° in LA right now? Scott's still adjusting. All I'm saying is that there is such a thing as seasons, although I do enjoy not having to shovel snow. And how's everything with the new restaurant? It's busy. I have never made so much avocado toast in my life. That reminds me, I need to go back and check on the diner. Matt's been texting me for about an hour. He said he's here, waiting for his grilled cheese. Well, you better not keep him waiting. No. I'll grab the bags.Okay. See you later. See ya. Well, I better get back to work. Can't be slacking off with the owner in town. Well, that's right. I'll be in the back if you need anything. Okay. Good to see you. Yeah, it's really good to see you, Lucy. Merry Christmas grandpa. Don't you worry, I will always keep your Christmas magic alive. Oh.
