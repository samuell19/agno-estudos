Father Daniel calling from Rieti, good evening. Good evening. I'd like to say something regarding these aliens. My collaborators and I can't help but chuckle when... why? As a religious man, are you worried? No, it's as if someone's trying to veer us away from our story, from our only path for salvation. Some are being led astray by these visions, but we mustn't forget there's only one path for salvation, from Adam and Eve to our blessed John Paul. After hearing the news do you think people are preoccupied more with wondering about religion and their souls, than about the Earth's survival? I think people are very preoccupied about their souls, even if they don't realize it. Thanks, Fr. Daniel. Next from Cesena we have Davide. Hello, I'm calling from Cesena. We have a soccer team that consists of young kids... - How is that relevant? - It is, let me explain. What does Cesena's soccer team have to do with the aliens? - Follow my line of thought. - That's rather foolhardy. It's important, even economically speaking. Not just for Cesena, but all places with youth soccer clubs. We started training our kids, our Italian kids, then foreigners started trickling in, we started taking in kids from Holland and France... - Then the non-UE immigrants came in. - Are you unwell? - I'm very well. - Is everything ok? So what does soccer have to do with the aliens? When these aliens arrive, only the bigger teams will be able to recruit them to play, the small teams will die out, and the national team will crumble. - Lots of money is at risk here. - Yes, I see... I can't help but comment, the fact that you're worrying about how aliens will destroy Italian soccer, which is already in decay, seems rather absurd, if not ridiculous, to be frank... "Naughty girl, age 45, shaved." No. "Alessandro, dentist." No. "35-year-old ex go-go dancer seeks job..." No. "New arrival: hot blonde, DD cup, super sexy, stunning backside." Hello? Hi. I was wondering if it's too late to come by. No, it's my first time. I'm new. Where? - I'm here, now what? - Do you see the happy family? The what? The happy family, do you see it? - I see it. - Go toward the happy family. Go inside the happy family, take the stairs, it's a straight shot. You're a waiter. Yes. Come. Let me show you... - Look. - At what? What magnificence! This was our furniture. - Handmade, original. - You are... People would come from Turin to sit at the oval table. - What parties! - Excuse me, are you... Those are our beds. I'd lie down and sing each afternoon. Can you sing? - No, I'm here to... - No! My entire family worked here. Look at that molding... Now all I have is gratuitous bailment. Come along! You really are a newbie... Sorry. Is it your first time with a professional lady? No. I'd say otherwise. You're a waiter. That's not the right bed. COUNCILMAN 90 EUROS There are rules. My grandfather built furniture in our garage. He worked day and night. His passion was passed on to my father, my mother, and then me. Come. It's that shirt... - why? - why? - it's wrinkled? - Very. - I never learned to iron properly. - Have your mom do it. Moms love to iron their son's shirts. I don't have a mom. How about those no-iron shirts? They're like magnetic. - Magnetic? - No? Am I wrong? I have a few, but they're not magnetic, it's a special fabric. A special fabric! Well... A man with a shirt like that is not acceptable. I didn't think anyone would notice. That's true. Are you one of those people who's afraid? Of aliens, I mean. Are you one of those people who's afraid? No. TH E LAST EARTH LING - Hi, Gabriele. - Luca! So, are you ready? - I just need to get dressed. - I mean ready for this UFO thing. I'm ready. I feel ready. - People are afraid, it's normal. - What is? Being afraid of these space creatures, who knows what they want. What do they want from you? Fucking hell! So disgusting! Look. Like it? "Under Skirts". By Giuseppe Geri. Our clients' asses. Look! All original footage. I can't show you this, it's my penis. You'll develop a complex, stop working, and go out even less. Hey, give me the number of that foxy trannie. Your friend. The one who... - What trannie? - The one they've seen you with. Who've they seen me with? Gabriele! Tell me again what you said about our pal going with fags? - But it's... - See, you do remember! - Give me the number. - I don't have it. Yes, you do. You have it and you'll give it to me. One bingo card... for the lady. I had an idea: I'll find me a woman and have a baby then ask the boss: "If I name my son Bingo, can I get life annuity?" Imagine my kid at school: "Bingo Del Genovese?". "Here." It's great publicity. ls that all you can say? - What did you say to him? - What? May I? - To Giuseppe? - What did I say? Check out the skank at table 3 with her tits hanging out. - You told him I do fags. - Trannies. So? I don't, he's my friend. So long as you're not on the receiving end it's okay... Table 8, not 3. Killer tits and legs. 37, 29, 14. 49, 70. 7-o. 78. 7-8. 3, 17. 39, 32, 76. 7-e. Giuseppe Geri to the manager's office. Come here, look. That's the North Star... Quit laughing! Don't you know we all come from stars? - Yes. - Walter! What's taking so long? Let's go. Let's go without her. We all come from stars. I'm a man so I'm from Mars. You ladies come from Venus. So, as I was saying... Cassiopeia... - Sorry. - Look who's here! It's about time! You made it. Sorry, Walter. You said we would be alone. I gave you a big surprise. Fuck! Awesome! SPEND YOUR MONEY WELL Mrs. Zani of My Dream Real Estate? - Yes? - I'm Bertacci, from apartment 3B-5. - What's the problem? - The problem... My shades are broken sol have to wear a sleep mask to bed. A sleep mask. I see... Mosquitoes have infested the pool's stagnant water. - They're devouring me. - Devouring you. - I see... - No, wait. There's a dead cat beneath my terrace. I know the apartments are for sale and it's an odd contract, but it's your duty to call someone... Mrs. Casale, I'm your neighbor. I found a dead cat... - Yes. Who is it? - Attorney Masini, I'm your neighbor. Sorry to bother you. Do you have a cat? - Yes, why? - I found a dead cat, is it yours? - No, mine's sleeping on the sofa. - Okay, sorry. - What kind of cat is it? - it's a cat, why? Perhaps it's Luini's cat. Do you know her? Yes... I mean, no. It might be hers. PLANETARY AWAKENING RELEASE THE POWER IN YOU This is how you hold a bottle. Ask who'll taste it, pour the wine, and wait for the lady to taste it. - What lady? - He's preaching about Italian style? That shithead! Last call for cards! Cards! This is a good one, it's free. - One card! - Last call for cards! There's a horrible smell in here, didn't you notice? Bertacci. Even the most humble job must be executed with elegance. - This is disgusting. - Indeed. When I worked at a restaurant in America, some days we had no work. We stood tall, at attention, waiting for customers. - He'd never understand these things. - Who, me? To you it looks like you're on your knees cleaning up someone's shit, but that's not the case. - Here at this hour? - The bingo hall just closed. - I didn't want to go home. - Hi baby, don't waste time with him. He's ugly, come with me. We'll have fun. What's that smell? Luca is my friend, not a client. Sure, just a friend, you never have any clients! Bitch! I had to clean up shit at work, my hands stink. It's not your hands. It's your clothes, I think. Really? - Don't you have to work? - Work, my foot! Not a single car stopped in the past 5 hours, who knows why. - Want me to drive you home? - No. Not home. - Let loose! - I can't dance, you know. - Huh? - I can't dance! Come on! Luca's always alone, he's a loner. How long have we been friends? - Dunno, along time. - I had a mustache still! He was the only neighborhood kid who didn't tease me. And now because of that, with this... - I declare you my friend forever. - No, don't. Be quiet. - Leave it on. - I could never be alone. Even the sturdiest plant would wilt without love. - There must be someone you like? - No, no one. - I think there is. - He said his neighbor is hot. - So there is! - I never said that. - Yes you did, liar. You did say it. - who is it? A girl in my building, but I don't think she's normal. - I think she's a nymphomaniac. - A nympho? Even better! I saw her with a man last night, they were sickening. - What were they doing? - Kissing. - Kissing... - How gross! It was the way they were kissing, plus he's gross. - Even the way he walks... - He's jealous, it's jealousy. - Jealous! - I wouldn't want to be him. She's the type of girl who uses you then dumps you. - Cuckold and mocked. - Not all us women are like that. If you were women, I wouldn't even be here talking. We're talking about people who love and trust each other. - If you were a man I'd call you... - What? A poor dummy. Hello there! Down boy. Behave! He's not like me, he's a city boy. - You'll ruin his work clothes. - Hi, dad. No, I wear a uniform. - Am I too early? - No, how are you? - Fine. If you have things to do... - No, don't be silly. If you're hungry, we'll eat now. I'll wash my hands and... - I have to go to work. - When? - At 6:00. - it's noon. Don't worry, you have time. I didn't make anything special. This won't be a six-hour Christmas lunch. Come on. - You should have the yard cleaned. - What's wrong with it? It's almost ready. If you want, watch some TV in the meantime. No, I have a headache. Plus, I never watch TV, I don't even own one. I didn't watch TV when I was your age either. It didn't exist. Even if it had, I wouldn't have watched it, I did other things. Go ahead, watch the news. it'll be ready soon. - Can I help? - No. Some news on the alien arrival... - That's all they talk about! - What? Martians! Lots of people are afraid... People are always afraid of something. ..from theme-parties in the Adriatic coast's clubs, to the traditional Immaculate Conception procession, this year, the Mary statue was accompanied by spaceships... carved from local tuff stone. Some people gather together and pray... Pray, what nonsense. - All my neighbors bought them. - And you? I did too. Lucky you, with money to spend on binoculars nowadays. They're just plastic. A local priest spoke to his parish about the aliens, suggesting they read the Papal encyclical: "Adventus martianis". When your mom was around... remember? Know how many times she tried to drag me to church? But I never went. And then what? A faithful woman, friend of priests. Faithful indeed... No, because... People talk... but then... But then what? - You're eating cookies with that? - No! But then... She ditches her husband and child and leaves. - Don't start. - She moves on to a new life. Cheers. And you? What? Women? All the better. One cuckold less. Hello, I was ringing your buzzer but no one answered. - I'm getting home now. - I'm Anna Luini, your neighbor. I know, I've watched you... I've seen you around. - I heard a cat was found. - Yes, a dead cat. Attorney Masini told me... the attorney who lives down there, he told me a dead cat was found, but was it you who found it? I found a dead cat, but I don't know if it was yours. It was intact, it didn't have a crushed skull... - ..like roadkill usually does. - Where is it now? I saw it... on the ground, there. - I was cleaning the pool when... - There? - Yes, further up. - Over here? Yes. Further up. Excuse me! It's not there, where is it? Did you bury it? - No, I didn't bury it. - You didn't bury it? Since Sunday? I buried it in the garbage bin. You threw it in the trash? What was I supposed to do? If it were a person, would you throw it in the trash? Not if it were a person, but a cat... What were you thinking? You threw it in the trash. I'm sorry, I... Sorry? Sorry? Excuse me, could you come here for a second? I always thought you were just a bit odd, perhaps an idiot, but you're actually the ugliest thing I've ever seen. A monster. A monster. UFO PLANETARY AWAKENING You're new here, this is the world's best bingo hall. We run a tight ship here, you each need to give it your all. We can do a good or bad job, we've opted to do it with style which is pretty easy for us because we're Italians, the kings of style. - You have an American accent. - Yes. He lived in America for 15 years, married an American, he worked in an important Italian restaurant. Where was it? - Wow! - A famous restaurant. I was a host, I'd stand for 6 hours with my hands behind my back. I welcomed customers. In a place like that, you had to look spiffy. This is also part of Italian style: knowing how to serve. Why'd you come back? His wife left him, he became depressed, and lost his job. - Excuse me. - You'd better watch it! I've had this dream every night since they announced the arrival of the aliens. - You came to talk about the dream? - No, I have a personal question. - Something serious? - Something personal. Go ahead. What would you do if you found a dead cat? - What would I do... - If you found a dead cat? - I don't know, I'd throw it away. - Exactly. If it were mine, I'd bury it. - If it were yours? - Yes. My cat hasn't died, I don't even have a cat. - it's my neighbor's. - That neighbor? Yes, someone killed her cat and I found it. I threw it in the trash, she got mad and yelled at me. - You knew it was hers? - Yes, but so what? - You couldn't have a funeral for it. - Exactly. Anyway, she's a bitch. - A whore. - Like all women. - Yes. - I'm fed up with your take on women. - I can't smoke in here, right? - No. - You talk to me because you trust me. - Yes, but you're different. Different? - I know you... - Look! See that? It's a shooting star. Don't be afraid of the aliens, everything will be fine. - I'm not afraid. - Of course not. Who is it? What do you want? I have a rifle! Are you alone? Good morning. Listen... I came to apologize for being so mean to you. I don't know if you ever lost a pet, but I can assure you that it is... Excuse me, my coffee is boiling. The things I said... I don't know what came over me, I'm not that kind of person. I'm nice to everyone, I think. - Would you like some coffee too? - Yes, thanks. Come in. Your apartment is very tidy. Yes, apart from the shades and the mosquito-infested pool. I've had problems with the superintendent too. Plus, we could get kicked out of here any day now. We sure are close... Don't worry, I mind my own business. - Sugar? - No, thanks. - Do you work? - Yes, at the bingo hall. Know it? - Yes, but I've never been. - it's not a nice place for women. - How so? - Some women... go there alone, leaving their husbands at home. I work at a highway rest stop restaurant. - Lucky you. - Yes, that's what everyone says. - What does your boyfriend do? - Boyfriend? The guy with the black car, he's your boyfriend, isn't he? Yes, he works for a big company, he's a manager. Something like that. When I found the oat I thought... - What? - Nothing, sorry. Good coffee. All right... Thanks for the coffee, I have to go run some errands. - You're welcome. - Thanks. Bye. Sorry about the cat, it was a lovely cat. I wish it were still alive. Guess it had to happen. In order to talk to her, the cat had to be killed and you had to find it. What can you do? At times, life takes unexpected paths. - Like the bingo hall, for example. - What about it? Dunno, nothing. I don't blame you for going with hookers, I'd do the same. - What does that have to do with it? - It's just an example. If I were in your shoes, I'd go with hookers too. I don't have to do those things, but if I were you I would. Why me but not you? Because you're ugly, undeniably ugly. All right, look. Now I'll teach you how to plant tomatoes. Watch. First you make a hole, then you get a tomato sapling... And put it in the hole like this. Look over here, sweetie. Look at the tomato. If you don't watch... Then you cover it with dirt. Listen... Pay attention, sweetie. Look. Here, not there. You cover it properly so the soil is nice and even... You get some water. This is water. And you pour some on it. Sweetie, don't go over there! Don't go there! Come here. Come back. You came alone? - Gabriele didn't come? - Apparently not. They're two world-famous scientists, they'll give us detailed info. They're two world-famous scientists. Welcome! We have a full house, I'm thrilled. But above all, our brothers of light are thrilled. I'm in contact with them, I've held conferences about them. They send their greetings and we reply with a nice "Namaste". Perfect, that's the right energy. Speaking of energy, we have an abductee, a brother of light who has been taken by aliens at least 14 times! - 16. - He's been taken by aliens 16 times. He lived with them on a spaceship, but now I'll pass the mic... We found it on our way here. Here is our light master and my collaborating partner, Walter Rasini. Thanks. Now we'd like to share with you a rather intimate experience. Please remain silent and listen to the sounds that we will produce with these sacred instruments whose origin is... - Aramaic? - Yes. These sounds form a pathway toward superior entities. All right? So close your eyes and we'll come by. Namaste. It's a brightly lit room. - What do you see around you? - Them. I see them around me. - Me. - What are they doing? One... stands behind me. - Is he blond? - Yes. Blond with 6 fingers, he's harmless. - No, he's not harmless. - He's not, why? He has 6 fingers... One is long. - Perhaps it's a reptilian. - Reptilian! Careful, reptilians are driven by sexual impulses. - He's leaning on me! - Relax, Federico. Come back to us. A round of applause for him. Obviously there are questions that hover above us. We talk about an invisible reality, but it's important you understand that this reality... can do something for you because we live like slaves and they're aware of this. We live like slaves! Know what I did? Want to know? I worked in a call center. 820 euros a month for 8 hours a day. Now I work with him, I work with God, and I work with beings of light. Do you honestly want to keep working 8 hours a day? Raise your hand if you want to work like a slave. No one, naturally. How about working 3 hours a day like they do in the Pleiades? - Raise your hand if you'd like that. - Is it an island? No, a constellation. Too bad a day only lasts 3 hours in the Pleiades. - Does anyone have something to say? - No, no... You're free to speak. Our friend says a day lasts 3 hours in the Pleiades soil: would be the same as working all day. You friend knows this because he's a being of light? If you're a being of light, a mere medium like myself would invite you on stage... But that's not the case. Thanks. Don't forget to sign up for our universal harmony society, so we, hand in hand, can all enter the great elevator toward the fifth dimension. Namaste. - I'm blown away. - He's amazing. Luca, can you hold my cat while I get my book signed? Thanks. - Hi, I'm Renata. - Joseph. Sara. - You were great! - Thanks. Walter, will I see you at the Verona conference? Sure, I'll call you. So how long have you been interested in aliens? Not that long, actually. Since we found out they'd be landing here. - I always believed in them. - Me too, but it's different now. - How old are you? - 26. - 27. - Renata, your cat. I asked you to hold it for me. - Do we know each other? - I don't think so. Aren't you the Pleiades expert? Listen, I sense extreme negativity in you. Open up, let yourself feel the positive astral energy. Like her, she comes from Venus. - We all come from the stars. - Really? Ladies, perhaps you could give us a hand. - I do write occasionally. - Really? Excuse me... What about the cat? Animals aren't allowed in the place we're going to. Amrir, ruler of light, we thank you for all you gave us. - How much did he give us? - "Hypnosis Recording"... plus the "Abductee's Story" brochure... makes 65. - 65 euros? - Yes. Fuck the abductee! We paid for his breakfast, lunch, and hotel just to get 65 euros? But he was incredible. - Next time, no adbuctee. - I liked him, I still have goosebumps. How'd we do with the shirts? The ones that said "Amrir"... 275. - Good, and? - The ones that said "Christ"... 190. Amrir beats Christ 3 to 2. Damn. Fuck, the computer went off. I didn't even save... What the fuck? - Fuck, it's them! - Who? Them! Salutations, my master. I have sinned, I beg forgiveness and submit to your will. I also repent for my sins. My sire, master of light, in your infinite goodness, forgive us and guide us because we have lost our way. Good morning. I found this cat, I thought you might like to have it. - Whose is it? - Nobody's, it was abandoned. - You're sure it doesn't have a home? - No, it doesn't. Very kind of you. - Do you want to keep it? - I didn't get it for myself. Can I offer you a coffee at least? - Sure. - Two coffees in... - How long have you been here? - 3 years. - Me too. - I know. Two coffees in 3 years, we're practically friends. Your boyfriend's not here? No, I haven't seen him in days. Come in. Will you hold it? Thanks. - It already ate. - Great. - See, you do like animals. - Yes... No... My father has a sort of farm, I grew up around animals. Your boyfriend isn't here today? No, I already told you. Why so interested in him? No... I wonder how two very different people could be together. It's rather normal. Yes, but you should trust each other, not lie and such, right? Right, we should. That's me. - Yes, I can tell. - That really was my boyfriend. Apart from how people manage to stay together, what's odd is we're here talking casually about it. - It likes me! - Yes. After 3 years... No, I meant the aliens. These aliens are arriving and could change the world and we're here talking about animals and boyfriends... Yes, but things won't change from one second to the next. - Are you afraid? - No, I'm not afraid. I'm not like those people who gather to pray and talk about... about illumination and the fifth dimension. What? Nothing, never mind. We should be afraid of things not changing at all: me at the rest stop and you at the bingo hall forever. The bingo hall isn't bad. Hello, dad? I can't now. I have to go to work soon. I'll come by tomorrow. Tomorrow. Bye. - Everything okay? - He says he has a surprise for me. - Mr. America? - What? Listen... - Did you go to the conference? - Yes. I wanted to come, but a multinational called me about business sol couldn't make it. I behave badly, I know, but don't make me lose my job over this. - It depends. - No, it doesn't. - I have a wife and kid. - Think before you act. I want to be forgiven for how I behaved. - It was your fault. - An idea came to mind. I want to do something for you. - For me? - Although we've had problems at work, I think there is one thing, one only, we can both agree upon. What? The fact that pussy is pussy. As a truce, I'd like to give you a gift. Don't forget the lights. I met a nymphomaniac. She's beyond a whore. You know those giant brushes in car wash tunnels? She can do the same with her tongue. She's not a hooker, she's a cleaner! - For me? - I'll give her to you as a gift. It's a deal. I'll handle it all, but... Dad? Dad? Luca! See? She came down from the heavens the other night. She cleaned and tidied up everything. Look at the flowers, we planted the seeds and they bloomed in an hour. This is my son Luca. Shake his hand. Don't be afraid, it's like mine. I taught her to handle the animals, she's already a pro. Come along, Luca. Come! She's really great. I don't know why, but I'm so happy with her here. They told us they'd be coming but who knew it'd be like this, who knew we'd enjoy them so much. She's like a woman, you know? Don't make that face. I made that same face at first but once you get to know her... you'll like her too. - Did she make this? - Ask her, she understands. Did you make this? Look at this room, when did it last look this good? Along time ago. Yes, long ago. Thanks to her. It's good. It's really good. Then let's eat. I thank the heavens that I have both of you here, with me, on this beautiful day. If you need help with the cat, I can feed it and take it outside for walks, if you want. Sorry, cats don't go need to be taken outside, they go alone. But if you could feed it at times that would be good. I'd appreciate it, I often get stuck at work. - Okay, that's all I had to say. - Wait! Would you mind giving me a lift when you're done? I'm done. So you have a second job? How much do they pay you? No, they don't pay me. - They don't pay you? - No, I just like doing this. I told you I liked animals. Actually, you said I liked animals since I grew up around them. - Is that what I said? - No. This whole alien situation is funny. Everyone imagines them as they please. I'd like for them to have a special power. To teach dogs not to pull on their leash? No, I'd like them to be capable... of distinguishing good from bad, indisputably. They could do good things for honest, generous people, and make bad people pay for their misdeeds. It's not easy to know if someone's good or bad. For us it's not, maybe it's different for them. Maybe they know the truth. Who knows how they see things. Maybe they have a different concept of time. I can't help but wonder what they look like, if they're tall or short, if they're touchable or if they're made of energy... Anna? There's something I think you'd like to see. What? That's my father. But that's not my mother. Though she cooks really well. Where the fuck are you? We're waiting. - For what? - For what? You forgot? Doesn’t this nymphomaniac have an apartment? Right, with her husband sleeping in the next room! He thinks he's meeting a hot babe, but it's a trannie and we'll film it. Imagine that? Yes, I do. It's a dumb thing to do. This way Mr. America will stop bossing us around. He made you stick your nose in shit, wake up! Why did they have to come? It's not my fault we happened to run into them. What could I have said? You and I alone in the car... they might've thought we were fucking each other. Plus, for a gal like that you're not enough. I'll be enough, you'll see. I doubt it. I'll go tell her you're here, then you go in. Just like that? She's a nymphomaniac, no need for flowers! She's waiting for you. I had an idea, I want to make disposable condoms. Wasteful, but very handy, you don't have to wash them every time. Get ready, Mr. America! He'll never make you clean the john again. Go, Mr. America. Get the cell phone. - What did you eat? - Hurry. What the fuck? What the fuck... Jerk! Go home! Shithead! Damn, I touched his balls! Fuck off, you loser! That's enough, Mr. America. Bastard! Luca, see what's going on? See what he did to me? - Let's go. - What the fuck did you do? - What the fuck did you do? - it's nothing. Luca, start the car. Start the car, Luca! What the fuck are you doing? Go! What the fuck are you doing? Fuck you, Luca! Where's my hair? Give me my hair. Put it on properly. My friend Luca, he's not afraid. - Hello? - Luca, you're a dickhead! That fag has our numbers, go back and get the phone. - Why me? - Just go, for fuck's sake! If I go out this late, what'll I tell my wife? Ask Gabriele, I'm not going back there. Listen retard, go back to that fucking street and get that fucking phone or we'll all go to jail! - What the fuck are you saying? - Nobody's here. Everything's like it was before but she's gone. - Call him! - I have to call her? Yes! But how? She's dead, I saw her. Then where is he? Look around, you dipshit! Is there an ambulance, the police, anything? No, just the car, a pool of blood, and your fucking rock. So that asshole walked off with his own legs! Call him and tell him he'd better not report us. - How can I call a dead woman? - How do you know he's dead? LUCA MY FRIEND Put it down, here. You'll never beat him! Humans are better than aliens! No. Come here! Here! Come, I'll show you something. Come, come with me. This... Go inside. Go. Go! Fernando, how are you? Okay. - Your bills. - Darn it. - it's been a while, hasn't it? - Quite some time. - What've you done? - What've I done? - This place looks different. - What are you looking at? Yes, things are going well. Very well. - And you... - What? You must be hiding something! Bye. - Come by the bar tonight. - Okay, I will. I'll see if I can. - So you can update us all. - And we'll dance. - Come by tonight. - Sure, see you tonight. What's going on? It seems your friend is tired of living. What did you tell him, shithead? What did you tell him? If you said anything I will kill you. - What did you say, asshole? - Nothing. - I just told him I'm leaving. - What the fuck for? You're a piece of shit. You ruined us all. Hey, you hit him first, fuckface. Nobody is ruined more than they were yesterday. He was just a fag, not the Minister of Internal Affairs. What could he do? Report us? A trannie! Luca. Where are you going? If you really think about it, nothing happened. What happened? We found the car. We found it because the hotel called us. The hotel said Walter and J.P. were with two girls. - We thought one was you. - It wasn't you? - Sorry. - No one has seen them since. - We thought you heard from him. - You haven't? The hotel room was half burned. Didn't we tell you? Hi. You're a waiter. Not anymore. I understand. Let's go. Let's dance, let's dance... it's not lightning. I've heard them even when the sun's shining, it's not lightning. Come here. Excuse me. Hello? Dad, is that you? What is it? Dad! Luca. What's wrong? Sit down. Luca... I screwed up. - Just once... - What did I do just once? Not you. Blue, blue... Salt, salt... square, garlic... square, circle, tomato. "l already know..." "l already know how things will end. Goodbye, Earthling." She wrote it. She knew how to write too? She knew how to do everything. Where'll I find another girl like her? I told her I'd stop by the bar quickly. I planned to come back soon but then I sat there... And drink this, drink that... And that bartender with her tits... - She left? - She left. I'm alone again. It's normal. She was a woman after all. Are you dumb? She came from Venus, from Pluto, or wherever, she's not the same. No, actually they're all the same. Huh? Like mom, that's how they are. Remember how pretty she was? Everyone said she was pretty. The heavens must have sent her, and her too! One day... she got all dolled up, you should've seen her! She said she was meeting her girlfriend in town. "You got all dolled up for your girlfriend?" Understand? Yes, I don't need the details. Plus, I probably drank a bit, just a little. Remember how she always broke my balls when I came home late from the bar? "You can't treat me this way, you're always drunk." I said: "l may be always be drunk, but you're a whore". She looks at me and leaves. I say: "Where are you going? You can’t just leave." She leaves. She doesn't even turn around. I look at her. I lost my mind. It can happen, right? Then I race behind her. What was in my hand? A rake? What was it? Then I look at her. She's not moving anymore. She's not moving anymore. I dig... a hole. You should've seen how I cried. This is nothing in comparison. Even though I'm sad that alien left. Where is she? Where? By now she's on a different planet. Where is mom? - In the field. - Where? In the field. Where? I don't want to tell you where. - You don't? - No. Tell me where. What could I have done? Told me the truth. You would've hated me. Instead, I hated myself. No need to make a scene over something that happened 30 years ago. We've been hearing more stories from people who've met the newly-arrived aliens. Some stories are disturbing. They're coming, we won't be killed! We won't let them kill us! Let's enter the hospital to see what's happening. This patient's in a confused state. - What happened? - If only you'd seen them. They're evil creatures. Look what they did to my face! My husband and I are decent people, we've never hurl: anyone. Our son was sick before, and now he's healed. Everyone's leaving. I know.
