[ROARING] [SHOUTING A WAR CRY] [ROARING TOGETHER] [♪♪] [BEAR GRUMBLING] [GRUMBLING] [♪♪] [CHURCH BELL RINGS] GOODNIGHT, THAT YOU? SHERIFF. WELL, SORRY, JUDGE. I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE YOU. [CHUCKLING] I GOT A NEW HAT. WHAT DO YOU GOT FOR ME? I CAN SEE YOU'VE BEEN BUSY. WE CAN START ANYTIME YOU WANT. I'D LIKE TO WASH UP FIRST. THERE'S A BOWL OF WATER IN MY OFFICE. COURT'S SET UP IN THE GENERAL STORE. WHAT HAPPENED TO THE COURTHOUSE? BURNED DOWN, ALONG WITH THE HOTEL. SALOON DIDN'T BURN DOWN, DID IT? NOT YET. GOOD. YOU SEE TO IT THAT IT DOESN'T NOT UNTIL I'M GONE ANYWAY. [♪♪] WILL THIS COURT NOW COME TO ORDER? JUDGE JOHN WILLIAM GOODNIGHT PRESIDING. [♪♪] [♪♪] THE LAST CASE OF THE DAY... DOOGAN VERSUS CASSIDY. YOU'RE CASSIDY? I AM, AND IT'S AN HONOR TO STAND BEFORE YOU, SIR. YOUR REPUTATION PRECEDES YOU. WELL, WHAT REPUTATION IS THAT? WORD IS, YOU'VE NEVER BEEN WRONG ON A VERDICT. IF THAT'S TRUE, WHICH I DOUBT, LET'S HOPE YOURS ISN'T THE FIRST. OH, I'M SURE IT WON'T BE, AS LONG AS YOU FIND ME INNOCENT. [CROWD CHUCKLES GOOD-NATUREDLY] ARE YOU RELATED TO MIKE CASSIDY? NOT BY BLOOD, BUT HE TOOK ME IN. HE WAS A GENEROUS MAN. HE WAS A HORSE THIEF. IT'S NOT HIS FINEST QUALITY, I WILL ADMIT-- NOR IS IT YOURS, YOUNG MAN. THE GREAT TERRITORY OF WYOMING HAS A PENALTY FOR STEALING HORSES. IT INVOLVES A ROPE. WELL, I DO PREFER A NECKTIE TO A ROPE, SIR. [CROWD CHUCKLING] I ASSUME YOU'RE ACQUAINTED WITH CHARLES DOOGAN. I AM. I WORK AS A BUTCHER IN ROCK SPRINGS. HE WAS A CUSTOMER. HE'S ACCUSED YOU OF STEALING HIS HORSE. I'VE BEEN ACCUSED OF MANY THINGS, YOUR HONOR. PROBABLY LESS THAN HALF OF THEM ARE TRUE. I'M INTERESTED IN THE OTHER HALF. NOW, MR. DOOGAN COULDN'T BE WITH US TODAY. HE'S THE VICTIM OF AN UNFORTUNATE ACCIDENT. YES, I WAS VERY SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT THAT. I'M SURE YOU WERE. HIS AFFIDAVIT STATES THAT ON THE DAY IN QUESTION HE WAS RIDING HIS HORSE, AND YOU GRABBED HIS BRIDLE. TO BE PRECISE, I ACTUALLY GRABBED THE HORSE'S BRIDLE, AS MR. DOOGAN WAS NOT BRIDLED THAT DAY. [LAUGHTER] [CHUCKLING] YOU'D MAKE A GOOD LAWYER. THANK YOU. THAT IS NOT A COMPLIMENT. MR. DOOGAN'S HORSE WAS ABOUT TO THROW HIM, SO I INTERVENED AS ANY GOOD SAMARITAN WOULD. AND WHERE IS THIS HORSE? IT RAN OFF. DISAPPEARED, NEVER TO BE SEEN AGAIN? AND HOW DID YOU GET HERE FROM ROCK SPRINGS? I RODE IN. ON A COW? [LAUGHTER] YOUR HONOR, I'M NOT A HORSE THIEF. DO I THINK YOU'RE CAPABLE OF STEALING A HORSE? THAT AND MORE. YOU'VE ALSO EXHIBITED QUALITIES HERE TODAY THAT LEAD ME TO BELIEVE YOU COULD DO GREAT THINGS, IF YOU CHOOSE. THE ROAD YOU TAKE IS YET TO BE SEEN. [YAWNING] FORTUNATELY FOR YOU, I'VE HAD A VERY LONG DAY. THIS IS MY LAST CASE. I SORELY NEED A DRINK. THAT COUPLED WITH A LACK OF EVIDENCE... INSPIRES ME TO TAKE A CHANCE ON YOU. YOU'RE FREE TO GO, MR. CASSIDY. DO NOT DISAPPOINT ME. THANK YOU, YOUR HONOR, AND SHOULD WE MEET AGAIN, YOU CAN CALL ME WHAT THE FOLKS AT THE SHOP CALL ME-- "BUTCH." [♪♪] WELCOME BACK, JUDGE. CAN I POUR YOU A WHISKEY? I WOULD NOT STOP YOU. OH, A LETTER CAME FOR YOU A FEW MONTHS BACK, AND IT LOOKS... LIKE A WOMAN'S HANDWRITING. YOU OPEN THIS? IS THAT ILLEGAL? TAMPERING WITH THE MAIL, THAT'S A FEDERAL OFFENSE. I DIDN'T OPEN IT. THAT'S, UH, ON THE HOUSE. [COUGHING AND SPLUTTERING] WHAT IS THAT? IS THAT COFFIN VARNISH? ALL THE GOOD STUFF WAS BOUGHT UP BY SOME CASSIDY FELLOW. [TICKING SOFTLY] NOW, I WOULDN'T BLAME YOU IF YOU TURNED ME OVER TO THE AUTHORITIES RIGHT NOW. LORD KNOWS, MY HUSBAND WOULD ROLL OVER IN HIS GRAVE IF HE KNEW I WAS TRYING TO SELL HIS INVENTION. WELL... PARDON MY BEING SO BOLD, BUT IF THIS DOES WHAT YOU SAY IT DOES, WHY SELL IT? WELL, SIR, I'M A GOD-FEARIN' WOMAN. THE SIN OF DOING WHAT I'M DOING ALREADY IS SURE ENOUGH TO SEND ME STRAIGHT TO HELL. BUT I AM A WIDOW NOW WITH NO MEANS OF SUPPORT. I WOULD LIKE TO GO BACK EAST TO BE WITH MY SISTER AND TRY AND PICK UP THE SHATTERED PIECES OF MY LIFE. A SMALL NEST EGG WOULD MAKE THAT POSSIBLE. I UNDERSTAND. SHOW ME. OH, WELL, IT'S REALLY VERY SIMPLE TO OPERATE. YOU SEE, ONCE IT'S SET... [RATCHETING CRANK] ONE COMES OUT... AND THEN THE OTHER. THIS IS ASTOUNDING. I CAN'T TELL THE DIFFERENCE. AS I MENTIONED, THE PRESS CAN ONLY PRINT TWO BILLS EVERY SIX HOURS. YOU SEE, THE PLATES HAVE TO DRY COMPLETELY, AND THE INK WELLS MUST REBALANCE, OTHERWISE THE BILLS COME OUT BLURRED AND DISCOLORED. [SNIFFLES] MY HUSBAND WAS WORKING ON AN EXPRESS DYE-TRANSFER SYSTEM USING ALCOHOL-BASED INKS. HE DIED BEFORE HE... I'M SORRY. [CRYING] NOW, NOW, MY DEAR. [SLIDES DRAWER CLOSED] EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE ALL RIGHT. HOW MANY OF THESE MACHINES DO YOU HAVE? OH, JUST THE ONE. [KNOCK ON DOOR] [CLEARING THROAT] SIR, YOUR WIFE IS ON HER WAY IN. MY WIFE? I-I'M HAPPY TO WAIT HERE WITH YOU THE SIX HOURS THAT IT TAKES FOR THE PRESS TO RECYCLE SO YOU CAN SEE THAT THE QUALITY IS-- NO, NO, NOW, THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY. THE, UM... SOONER WE CONCLUDE OUR BUSINESS, THE SOONER YOU CAN BOARD THAT TRAIN AND BE WITH YOUR FAMILY. UM... THAT WAS 1,000? I BELIEVE WE AGREED ON 2,000, SIR. MY-MY MISTAKE. 2,000 IT IS. WELL, THANK YOU KINDLY. IF I MAY, A WOMAN ALONE, SUCH AS YOURSELF, ESPECIALLY SUCH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN, COULD BE AN EASY MARK FOR SOMEONE, SO I WOULD ADVISE YOU TO BE VERY CAREFUL WITH ALL THAT MONEY. OH, I SURELY WILL. [♪♪] CAN YOU GET ME IN A GAME? HOW LONG ARE YOU HERE FOR THIS TIME? LET'S SEE... [UNCLASPING POCKETWATCH] FIVE HOURS AND 25 MINUTES. I'D KEEP YOUR BACK TO THE PINKERTON BY THE DOOR. SHUCKY DARN, LOOK AT THAT! [LAUGHING GLEEFULLY] YOU KNOW, YOU KEEP WINNING LIKE THAT, I'LL HAVE TO ACCUSE YOU OF CHEATING. WELL, I'D BETTER STOP WINNING THEN. [LAUGHS] YOU KNOW, THERE IS AN EASY WAY TO LEAVE A CASINO WITH A SMALL FORTUNE. OH, REALLY? AND WHAT IS THAT? WELL, YOU GO IN THERE WITH A LARGE ONE. [GIGGLES] MISS TRUFFAULT... WHAT A PLEASURE IT IS TO FINALLY BE BACK WITHIN YOUR GLOW ONCE AGAIN. WELL, I'M AFRAID THE PLEASURE'S ALL YOURS. PERHAPS I CAN JOIN YOUR FRIENDLY GAME. TWO UNUSED, BEAUTIFUL BILLS... COURTESY OF A WIDOW FRIEND IN FORT COLLINS. YOU TOOK MONEY FROM A WIDOW? TRUTH BE TOLD, SHE TOOK ME. [CHUCKLES, SCOFFING] FORTUNATELY, YOU LOOK LIKE A MAN THAT HAS MORE MONEY THAN HE KNOWS WHAT TO DO WITH. YOU'RE SORELY MISTAKEN IF YOU THINK THIS IS ABOUT MONEY. [GASPS IN FRIGHT] SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE. SHE'S GOT MY MONEY, MISTER. ARE YOU ADDRESSING ME, SIR? BECAUSE IF YOU ARE, THE PROPER MONIKER WOULD BE "COLONEL." COLONEL CYRIL KNOX. I DIDN'T MEAN ANY DISRESPECT... COLONEL. THEN YOU WILL LIVE ANOTHER DAY. RETURN TO YOUR GAME, GENTLEMEN. THIS WOMAN HAS BUSINESS ELSEWHERE. CYRIL, DON'T DO THIS. CYRIL-- I WAS A DAY BEHIND YOU IN ABILENE, ONLY HOURS IN ALAMOGORDO. YOUR TRAIL IS LITTERED WITH THE SOULLESS CORPSES OF YOUR WOULD-BE BOYFRIENDS-- YOUR VICTIMS, OF WHICH I AM NOT. WELL, CLEARLY, WE HAVE BOTH EXERCISED POOR JUDGMENT RECENTLY. SEEING AS HOW YOU'VE COME ALL THE WAY FROM FORT COLLINS, WHY DON'T I MAKE IT UP TO YOU? [STAMMERS] [FUMBLING WITH BILLS] THAT'S $2,000. I BELIEVE WE'RE EVEN. EVEN? I KILLED YANKEES IN THE GREAT WAR. I FOUGHT THE COMANCHE AND KIOWA, AND THEY LEFT NOT A SCRATCH ON MY HIDE. [YELPING IN FEAR] THEN YOU TAKE A BOTTLE TO MY FACE WHEN I'M SPIRITED? SORRY. NOT YET YOU'RE NOT, BUT YOU WILL BE, HARLOT. YOU WERE GOING TO KILL ME-- JUST LIKE YOU DID TO THAT POOR GENTLEMAN OVER AN APPLE, REMEMBER? I WOULDN'T HAVE KILLED YOU THEN. I LOVED YOU. BUT NOW... [GASPING IN FEAR] MY NAME IS LUCY TRUFFAULT! I'M WANTED FOR LARCENY IN THREE STATES-- NOW, HOLD ON! I'M WANTED FOR LARCENY IN THREE STATES, AS WELL AS FORGERY, FRAUD, AND LAND-SCHEMING. LUCY TRUFFAULT, ALIAS ALICE TRENT, ALIAS ALICE IVERS... WANTED FOR LARCENY, FRAUD, LAND-SCHEMING, FORGERY, AND BRIBERY OF A PUBLIC OFFICIAL. WELL, I NEVER BRIBED A PUBLIC OFFICIAL. SHE'S MINE, PINKERTON. IT'S COLONEL KNOX, ISN'T IT? I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR MISS TRUFFAULT FOR SOME TIME, AS HAS THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE PINKERTON DETECTIVE AGENCY. NOW, IT CLEARLY SAYS HERE ON THIS BILL THAT ONCE SHE IS FOUND, SHE IS TO BE BROUGHT TO FORT COLLINS AND REMANDED INTO CUSTODY OF A FEDERAL MARSHAL. COLONEL, MY AUTHORITY HERE SUPERSEDES YOUR DESIRE IN THIS CASE. NOW, YOU ARE WELCOME TO VISIT MISS TRUFFAULT IN FORT COLLINS PRISON IN TWO DAYS' TIME. [SHACKLES RATTLING] THERE IS NO PLACE THAT YOU CAN GO THAT I CAN'T GET TO YOU. WELL THEN, MAYBE NEXT TIME, I'LL JUST HAVE TO TAKE YOUR WHOLE EYE. I AM YOUR PRISONER, SIR. EXCUSE ME. [TICKING SOFTLY] [CLICKS, GEARS WHIZ] [DEVICE CLANKS] [CHUCKLES IN SATISFACTION] [RATCHETING CRANK] [CRANK RATCHETS FURIOUSLY] [♪♪] THANK YOU. YOU PROBABLY SAVED MY LIFE BACK THERE. IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE IT WAS GOING TO END WELL. HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN A PINKERTON? I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO TALK TO THE DETAINEES, MA'AM. WE'VE GOT A TWO-DAY RIDE. THAT'S GONNA BE AN AWFUL LOT OF NOT TALKING. SIX YEARS. SIX YEARS, GOODNESS. WHAT YOU MUST HAVE SEEN AND DONE IN ALL THAT TIME. YOUR WIFE MUST WORRY CONSTANTLY. NO WIFE. A HANDSOME MAN LIKE YOU? YOU OVERESTIMATE ME. YOU UNDERESTIMATE YOURSELF. MAY I SEE MY WANTED POSTER? $200 REWARD... THAT'S IT? THAT'S DISAPPOINTIN'. IT'S BECAUSE YOU'RE A WOMAN. SO I'M NOT WORTH AS MUCH? NO, MA'AM, YOU ARE NOT. WELL, IF YOU WERE MARRIED, YOU WOULD QUICKLY REALIZE THAT A GOOD WOMAN IS QUITE EQUAL TO A MAN, IF NOT SUPERIOR. FINE. COULD YOU JUST TAKE THESE CUFFS OFF? THEY'RE HURTIN'. PLEASE? WELL, I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO ESCAPE. IF I DO, YOU CAN SHOOT ME. ORDERS ARE TO TAKE YOU IN ALIVE. JUST SHOOT ME IN THE FOOT THEN. [♪♪] KILL THE PINKERTON AND THE DRIVER. LEAVE THE WOMAN FOR ME. [♪♪] [DISTANT GUNSHOTS] [THUNDERING HOOFBEATS AND GUNSHOTS] [TRADING GUNFIRE] [SHOTS BLASTING] [RIFLE BLASTING] I'M SORRY, I'M SO SORRY... [SHACKLES RATTLING] [GASPING IN FEAR] DON'T SHOOT! DON'T SHOOT! [KEY RATTLING IN SHACKLE] DON'T SHOOT. YOU ALL RIGHT? YES. THANKS TO YOU. I'M AFRAID I CAN'T SAY THE SAME FOR YOUR COMPANION. MA'AM, WHAT ARE YOU DOING TRAVELING WITH A PINKERTON? MY FATHER HIRED HIM TO ESCORT ME TO FORT COLLINS. I'M LUCY TRUFFAULT. JOHN GOODNIGHT. I WAS OUT WEST BUYING SPECULATIVE LAND FOR MY FATHER'S MINING COMPANY. SUPERIOR MINES OF PENNSYLVANIA? DUE TO OUR FAMILY WEALTH, HE THOUGHT I MIGHT BE A TARGET FIR KIDNAPPING... ARE YOU ROBBING HIM? I WOULDN'T BLAME YOU IF YOU WERE. I'M NOT ROBBING HIM. WELL... IT'S GOING TO GET LATE, AND I THINK I'D BETTER BE ON MY WAY. I CAN GET YOU AS FAR AS THE NEXT TOWN. OH, NO, THANK YOU. YOU'VE DONE QUITE ENOUGH ALREADY. I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE ONE OF THEIR HORSES. THERE WERE FOUR SHOOTERS, MA'AM. I ONLY GOT TWO OF THEM. I'M SURE THEY'RE LONG GONE BY NOW. I'LL BE FINE. GIVEN THE STATE OF YOUR LAST ESCORT, I PROBABLY SHOULD LET YOU RIDE ON ALONE, BUT I'M AFRAID I CAN'T DO THAT. WELL... IT'S VERY RARE TO MEET A REAL GENTLEMAN OUT HERE. I'M NOT SURE YOU HAVE YET. WHERE ARE YOU FROM, MR. GOODNIGHT? CHICAGO. THAT'S A LONG RIDE. THERE'VE BEEN A FEW STOPS ALONG THE WAY. YOU SHOOT LIKE A LAWMAN, OR AN OUTLAW. YOU EITHER ONE? NOPE. I ADMIT THAT'S A BIT OF A RELIEF. WHAT, THAT I'M NOT AN OUTLAW-- OR A LAWMAN? WELL, LAWMEN HAVE TOO MANY RULES, AND OUTLAWS HAVE NONE. I LIKE TO LIVE SOMEWHERE IN THE MIDDLE. INTERESTING THOUGHTS FOR A WOMAN OF PRIVILEGE. ARE YOU ACCUSTOMED TO MANY WOMEN OF PRIVILEGE? NONE THAT DRESS LIKE THAT. PURELY A BUSINESS DECISION. MOST LANDOWNERS, BEING MEN, ARE MORE INCLINED TO GIVE ME A GOOD PRICE WHEN I WEAR THIS DRESS. WE'RE THAT PREDICTABLE, ARE WE? SADLY, YES. I NOTICE YOU DON'T HAVE MANY SUITCASES. YOU TRAVELING LIGHT? WELL, MY BAGS MUST HAVE FALLEN OFF DURING THE ATTACK. WELL, I HAVE A BLANKET IF YOU GET COLD. THANK YOU. [♪♪] HOW LONG HAVE I BEEN ASLEEP? SEE THAT BALL IN THE SKY? THAT'S THE SUN. YOU RODE ALL NIGHT? YUP. SORRY I WASN'T BETTER COMPANY. I'VE HAD WORSE. REALLY? YUP, I ONCE HAULED A DEAD BODY ALL THE WAY FROM LAREDO TO LARAMIE. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO THANK YOU. WOULD YOU ACCEPT A REWARD? YOUR COMPANY IS REWARD ENOUGH. [CHUCKLES COYLY] WHOA... I'M VERY GRATEFUL. MAYBE... I HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN SOME TIME. WELL, WHAT ABOUT RIGHT NOW? YOU CAN GO WITH ME INTO THAT SHERIFF'S OFFICE RIGHT THERE. OH, WELL, AS DELIGHTFUL AS THAT SOUNDS, WHATEVER FOR? BECAUSE YOU'RE THE WITNESS TO TWO MURDERS. OH, WELL, I REALLY DIDN'T SEE MUCH, ALL DUCKED DOWN INSIDE AS I WAS-- SHERIFF! BUT ABSOLUTELY, IF I CAN HELP... [GROANING WEARILY] JOHN GOODNIGHT. THIS IS MISS TRUFFAULT. HI, SHERIFF. UM, HAVE WE MET BEFORE? SURELY, I'D REMEMBER THAT, MA'AM. HER COACH WAS AMBUSHED SOME 50 MILES OUT ON THE MORMON TRAIL WHEN I HAPPENED BY. THEY KILLED THE DRIVER OF THAT STAGE AND THE PINKERTON WHO WAS ESCORTING HER. HIRED BY HER FATHER. HE'S A BUSINESSMAN. IT'S SUPERIOR MINES OF PENNSYLVANIA, RIGHT? THAT'S RIGHT. THE PINKERTON WAS SUPPOSED TO ESCORT HER TO FORT COLLINS. AND THE ATTACKERS? TWO RODE OFF. TWO DEAD-- HIRED GUNS FROM THE LOOKS OF IT. WELL-ARMED AND WELL-PAID. THIS IS FOR THE RELATIVES AND THE NEXT OF KIN. OF THE TWO THAT RODE OFF, ONE OF THEM WAS AN APACHE-- FIGURED HIM FOR A TRACKER. THE OTHER ONE SEEMED TO BE IN CHARGE-- ALTHOUGH MISS TRUFFAULT MAY HAVE SOME ALTERNATE THEORIES? WELL, I DON'T GENERALLY ACQUAINT MYSELF WITH KIDNAPPERS AND MURDERERS. OF COURSE NOT. I'LL WIRE THE PINKERTON OFFICE AND LET THEM KNOW. OH. HOW LONG DO YOU THINK IT'LL TAKE BEFORE THEY GET BACK? HARD TO SAY. COULD BE A DAY OR MORE. BIG STORM BACK EAST'S BEEN KNOCKING DOWN THE WIRES. RIGHT. WELL, IF THERE'S NOTHING MORE I CAN ADD, I'D LIKE TO BUY A FEW DRESSES, REPLACE WHAT I'VE LOST. YOU DO THAT. WE'RE GONNA BE DISCUSSING SOME UGLY PARTICULARS NOW. WE WOULDN'T WANT TO OFFEND YOUR, UH... YOUR DELICATE SENSIBILITIES. NO... NO, NO, WE WOULDN'T WANT TO DO THAT. [CLEARS THROAT] WHOEVER KILLED THAT PINKERTON DID IT WITH A LONG RIFLE, AND THEY WERE A HELL OF A SHOT. FROM THE SADDLE, 100 YARDS, STRAIGHT THROUGH THE HEART? NOT TOO MANY PEOPLE CAN SHOOT LIKE THAT. I'LL PUT WORD OUT. ALL RIGHT, HIS BODY AND THE DRIVER'S ARE IN THE BACK OF THAT COACH. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THEM. GOT YOUR DOCKET HERE, JUDGE. I APPRECIATE IT. [♪♪] WHEN'S THE NEXT STAGE IN? UM, WHERE YOU HEADED? ANYWHERE. EXCEPT CHEYENNE. SPRINGFIELD LINE'S DUE IN DAY AFTER TOMORROW. THAT IS, IF IT GETS HERE ON TIME. NOTHING SOONER? [CLEARS THROAT] N-NO, MA'AM. I COULDN'T HELP BUT NOTICING YOU'RE, UH, YOU'RE WEARING THE SAME DRESS. ARE YOU INTERESTED IN WOMEN'S CLOTHES, MR. GOODNIGHT? ON AND OFF. MOSTLY OFF, I EXPECT. THAT'S QUITE A LARGE PLATE OF FOOD FOR JUST ONE PERSON. I GUESS I WORKED UP AN APPETITE SAVING YOUR LIFE. YOU KNOW, I NOTICED YOU WERE A LITTLE ANXIOUS TO GET OUT OF THE SHERIFF'S OFFICE. I JUST DIDN'T LIKE HOW HE WAS LOOKING AT ME. MY GUESS IS HE DOESN'T SEE A LOT OF WOMEN WHO LOOK LIKE YOU. WELL, HOW DO I LOOK? WELL, TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, IT'S A LITTLE PAINFUL TO LOOK AT YOU. OH. LIKE LOOKING INTO THE SUN. OH, IT'S MUCH WORSE. THERE'S A TELEGRAPH OFFICE ACROSS THE WAY IF YOU WANT TO WIRE YOUR FATHER. I DON'T THINK I WANT TO WORRY HIM. HOW ARE YOU GOING TO GET TO FORT COLLINS? WELL, AFTER YESTERDAY, FORT COLLINS HAS LOST ITS APPEAL. I'VE DECIDED I'D TAKE A TRAIN, HEAD BACK EAST. WELL, THE NEAREST RAIL, THAT'S... THAT'S CODY. 200 MILES RIGHT THROUGH INDIAN TERRITORY. I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU'RE HEADED IN THAT DIRECTION. I HADN'T PLANNED ON IT. WELL, I'D MAKE IT WORTH YOUR WHILE. HOW SO? OH. MONEY. OH, YOU DON'T LIKE MONEY? ON THE CONTRARY, IT'S, UH, IT'S HIGH ON MY LIST. HMM. WELL, WHATEVER ELSE IS HIGH ON YOUR LIST, MONEY'S ALL I'M OFFERING. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT. I'VE GOT A LITTLE BUSINESS TO CONDUCT HERE, AND WHEN I'M DONE, I'D LIKE TO HAVE A DRINK, THEN A GAME OF CARDS, THEN A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP, PREFERABLY ON A BED. GOOD, WE CAN LEAVE IN THE MORNING. YOU'RE PRETTY USED TO GETTING EVERYTHING YOU WANT, AREN'T YOU? NOT ANY MORE THAN YOU ARE, I EXPECT. HMM. WELL, I DO HATE TO CUT THIS SHORT, BUT I HAVE TO BE SOMEWHERE. MISS TRUFFAULT. OH, I HAVE NO OBJECTIONS TO YOU CALLING ME LUCY. GLAD TO KNOW IT. BETTER NOT. DON'T WANT TO WAKE ANYBODY UP IN THERE. [CROWD CHUCKLES] WILL THIS COURT NOW COME TO ORDER? JUDGE JOHN WILLIAM GOODNIGHT PRESIDING... LUCY. WOULD YOU, UH, LIKE TO JOIN US? OH, PERHAPS ANOTHER TIME, YOUR HONOR. YOU HAVE SOMEPLACE BETTER TO BE? WELL, WHY NOT? I AM QUITE INTERESTED IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. YES, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE. I GOT THAT WIRE OUT TO THE PINKERTONS. SHOULDN'T BE LONG NOW. WONDERFUL. GENTLEMAN AND LADIES OF THIS COURT, OCTOBER 31, 1847. THAT IS THE DAY I WAS BORN, NOT YESTERDAY. SO, KEEP THAT IN MIND WHILE TRYING NOT TO PERJURE YOURSELVES. FIRST UP, TAYLOR VERSUS KEMPNER. GENTLEMEN, WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE PROBLEM? MR. TAYLOR BOUGHT A GUN FROM ME, AND HE OWES ME $57. THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY FOR A GUN. WHAT IS IT, GOLD-PLATED? IT JUST CAME ON THE MARKET, YOUR HONOR. IT'S A DOUBLE ACTION, SELF-COCKING PIECE. FIRES TWICE AS FAST AS THAT OLD PERCUSSION CAP PISTOL YOU HAVE THERE, AND IT USES A HIGH-VELOCITY CARTRIDGE THAT'LL BURN EVEN WHEN WET. ARE YOU SAYING THAT GUN WILL FIRE IN THE RAIN? HELL, YOU CAN FIRE IT IN A BATHTUB. WELL, MR. KEMPNER, MY BATHS AREN'T USUALLY THAT EXCITING. [LAUGHTER] BEFORE I ASK YOU WHY YOU DIDN'T PAY HIM, I'D LIKE TO SEE THE GUN IN QUESTION, PLEASE. THIS IS A VERY NICE GUN. DO YOU ALWAYS TAKE EVIDENCE FROM YOUR CASES? TAKE? I PAID $62 FOR THIS ITEM RIGHT HERE. YOU COULD HAVE TOLD ME YOU WERE A JUDGE. I COULD HAVE. WHY DIDN'T YOU? ONCE PEOPLE FIND OUT, THEY ACT DIFFERENT. THEY TRY TO HIDE THINGS. I JUST LIKE TO HAVE A NORMAL CONVERSATION ONCE IN A WHILE. OH, SO YOU THINK I HAVE SOMETHING TO HIDE? EVERYBODY DOES. IT MUST BE A STRANGE FEELING, DECIDING PEOPLE'S FATES. PEOPLE DECIDE THEIR OWN FATES MOSTLY. BUT YOU HAVE THE POWER TO PUT THEM AWAY. I ALSO HAVE THE POWER TO SET 'EM FREE. WHICH DO YOU PREFER? I COULD MAKE A MISTAKE EITHER WAY, ALTHOUGH IT'S HARDER TO UNDO HANGING A MAN. I THINK I'LL TURN IN FOR THE NIGHT. I HAVE A ROOM UPSTAIRS. [CHUCKLES] I HAVE MY OF OWN ROOM, THANK YOU. I'M SURE YOU DO. I WAS JUST TRYING TO BE POLITE. WELL, YOU ARE THAT. CAN I WALK YOU TO YOUR ROOM THEN? THAT WON'T BE NECESSARY. I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING THEN. [♪♪] WHAT'LL IT BE? [HASTY KNOCK ON DOOR] [COCKING GUN] WHO IS IT? [LUCY, QUIETLY] IT'S ME. CHANGE YOUR MIND? THERE WAS A RAT IN MY ROOM. OOH, I HATE RATS. I THINK I'D JUST FEEL BETTER IF I STAYED HERE WITH YOU TONIGHT. OH, I KNOW I'D FEEL BETTER. DID YOU GET YOUR WHISKEY AND POKER GAME? WHISKEY, YES. POKER, NO. AH. THAT'S A SMALL BED. HMM. [SIGHING] [♪♪] ARE YOU COMFORTABLE? OH, VERY. GOOD. [THUMPS HEAD] WHERE YOU GOING? I AM GOING OUT. OUT WHERE? OUT THERE. ARE YOU COMING BACK? OF COURSE, I'M COMING BACK. I LEFT MY HAT, DIDN'T I? [SLAMS DOOR] [♪♪] THE QUESTION IS, IS LADY LUCK GOING TO BE ON YOUR ARM, OR ON MY ARM TONIGHT, FRIEND. SHE CAN BE A FICKLE LADY, CAN'T SHE? LET'S SEE THIS DEED. 160 ACRES OF DIRT. LUCKY ME. GAME'S OVER, GENTLEMEN. BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME. WHOA, WHOA, YOU CAN'T STOP NOW. YOU GOTTA GIVE US A CHANCE TO WIN THAT BACK-- YOU WANT THAT LAND BACK? I CAN ARRANGE TO HAVE YOU BURIED ON IT. FRENCH CROOK, RIGHT? YEAH, I USED TO SMOKE THOSE. FINALLY, SOMEONE CIVILIZED. WELL, I WOULDN'T GO THAT FAR. YOU MIND IF I PULL UP A SEAT? WELL, IF IT SUITS YOU. CYRIL KNOX. A PLEASURE TO MEET YOU, MR. KNOX. JOHN GOODNIGHT. IT'S COLONEL KNOX. YOU LIKE GAMES OF CHANCE, MR. GOODNIGHT? WELL, THAT DEPENDS. HOUSE RULES OR YOUR RULES? HEY, IF YOU'RE WINNING, FEEL FREE TO WALK AWAY. HOW ABOUT IF YOU'RE WINNING? OH, I WILL BE. CAVALRY, COLONEL? INDEED. YOU'RE NOT IN UNIFORM. NO, I'M NO LONGER ON ACTIVE DUTY. YOU'RE NOT A, UH... DESERTER, ARE YOU? NO. I'M JUST PURSUING MORE PROFITABLE INTERESTS. 600... NOT MUCH PROFIT IN SERVING ONE'S COUNTRY, UNLESS YOU, UH, COUNT HONOR. HERE'S TO YOUR HONOR. NO ONE HAS TOASTED MY HONOR IN A VERY LONG TIME. MINE EITHER. DID YOU SERVE? REGRETFULLY, UH, NO. I SPENT SEVEN YEARS SERVICE FIGHTING SAVAGES. I DID WHAT WAS REQUIRED, WHAT WAS NEEDED, BUT CERTAIN ACTIONS THAT WERE HERALDED DURING THE WARS HAVE FALLEN OUT OF FAVOR. WELL, I WOULD SAY, DEPENDING UPON WHAT ACTIONS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT, I'D SAY YOU GOT OFF LUCKY. HOW'S THAT? GROUNDS FOR DISMISSAL IN THE MILITARY, THAT MIGHT GET YOU HUNG IN A CIVILIAN COURT. ARE YOU A LAWYER? I DON'T LIKE LAWYERS. [GOODNIGHT CHUCKLES] ME NEITHER. THAT'S WHY I BECAME A JUDGE. [CHUCKLES IN WONDER] I NEVER BEAT A JUDGE IN CARDS BEFORE. YOU EVER LOSE TO ONE? [CHUCKLING] DO YOU BELIEVE IN LUCK, JUDGE? I DO. HOW ELSE DO YOU EXPLAIN THE SUCCESS OF THOSE YOU DISLIKE? I DON'T. I'M ALL IN. ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'LL SEE THAT... AND RAISE YOU. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, YOU THROW IN ONE OF THOSE CIGARS, AND THAT DEED RIGHT THERE, WE'LL CALL IT EVEN. COMIN' AT YA, JUDGE. THREE KINGS. WOW... BEATEN BY A STRAIGHT. AH... WELL, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, I THINK I'M GOING TO HAVE TO GET GOING. I HAVE GOT ME A DATE UPSTAIRS WITH A HARD FLOOR. [COCKING GUN] YOU DID SAY THAT I COULD WALK AWAY IF I WAS UP. I CHANGED MY MIND. YOU GOING TO SHOOT A JUDGE? I'M THINKING ABOUT IT. WELL, WHILE YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT THAT, WHY DON'T YOU THINK ABOUT THIS-- THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE HERE THAT DON'T LIKE YOU ALREADY. YOU DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT, YOU'RE LIABLE TO GO TO JAIL FOR A VERY LONG TIME. I HOPE WE GET TO PLAY AGAIN SOMETIME. I HOPE NOT. HEY... TAKE THIS HOME, YOU PUT IT UNDER YOUR MATTRESS, AND YOU DON'T BRING IT TO TOWN AGAIN. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. MY FATHER WAS A DIRT-FARMER JUST LIKE YOU. HE DIDN'T MAKE IT, AND YOU WON'T EITHER, IF YOU KEEP GAMBLING YOUR STAKE AWAY LIKE THAT. YOU GOT A WIFE AND KIDS? YEAH. WELL, THEY DESERVE BETTER THAN THAT. YOU GET HOME TO 'EM. THANK YOU, SIR. BLESS YOU, SIR. [RIFLE COCKING] WHAT ARE YOU DOING? IT'S THE APACHE FROM YESTERDAY. WHY IS HE GOING TO SEE THE SHERIFF? IT SEEMS STRANGE TO FOLLOW SOMEONE SO FAR, SO LONG. IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE KIDNAPPING. WHAT DOES IT FEEL LIKE? PERSONAL. I DON'T TRUST THAT SHERIFF. MAYBE I DON'T EITHER ANYMORE. COME ON. [SPLUTTERING AND GASPING FOR AIR] WELL, YOU SURE TOOK YOUR TIME. YOU'RE STILL ALIVE. BARELY. WE ARE WELL OFF THE BEATEN TRACK. APACHE TRACKER. RIGHT. WHERE DID YOU GET THAT FANCY CIGAR? I WON IT LAST NIGHT OFF A BAD MAN WITH A NASTY SCAR. WHAT, YOU DON'T LIKE CIGARS? HOW INSIGHTFUL. YEAH... YEAH, SEEMS LIKE I'VE GOT A LOT OF INSIGHT THESE DAYS. NOT SLEEPING WILL DO THAT TO YOU. DO SHARE YOUR MUSINGS. ALL RIGHT, WELL, SINCE YOU ASKED, I'M BEGINNING TO THINK THERE IS NO SUPERIOR MINES OF PENNSYLVANIA. [CHUCKLES] YOU DO HAVE A SUSPICIOUS NATURE. WHY DID YOU COME TO MY ROOM LAST NIGHT? I TOLD YOU, THERE WAS A RAT IN MY ROOM. SO, WHAT, I'M THE LESSER OF TWO EVILS? OR PERHAPS I JUST WANTED TO SHARE IN THE PLEASURE OF YOUR COMPANY. YEAH, IF THAT WERE THE CASE, I WOULDN'T BE SLEEPING ON THE FLOOR. [CHUCKLES] SORRY, I DIDN'T REALIZE I WAS ON THE WITNESS STAND. THOSE MEN WHO ATTACKED THAT STAGECOACH, THEY WERE IN TOWN LAST NIGHT. AND I GOT A FEELING THAT YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHO THEY ARE. REALLY? THEN WHY WOULDN'T I TURN THEM IN? I'VE BEEN ASKING MYSELF THAT VERY SAME QUESTION. SUPERIOR MINES OF PENNSYLVANIA WAS FOUNDED IN 1831 BY NATHAN TRUFFAULT. IT PRODUCES OVER 300 METRIC TONS OF COAL PER YEAR. IT WAS TAKEN OVER BY MY FATHER, NATHAN TRUFFAULT II, IN 1864. WELL, THAT IS AN IMPRESSIVE LIST OF FACTS, SO AT LEAST WE KNOW YOU'VE GOT A GOOD MEMORY. WELL, NOT AS GOOD AS YOUR IMAGINATION. I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, WHEN I'M SAFELY BACK HOME IN PHILADELPHIA, I WILL SEND YOU A LETTER ON COMPANY STATIONERY. I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT. GO. [CLUCKING TO HORSE] [♪♪] LET'S STOP HERE. WE'LL CAMP HERE FOR THE NIGHT. YOU RIDE LIKE YOU'VE BEEN IN THE SADDLE FOR A LONG TIME, MISS TRUFFAULT. WELL, THE WEST IS A BIG PLACE, JUDGE. WHEN YOU'RE BUYING LAND, YOU'RE HARD PRESSED TO FIND A GOOD PRICE NEXT TO A RAIL LINE. BEING A WOMAN OUT HERE, ALL BY YOUR OWN... I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO FIND COMFORT IN THE ARMS OF A STRANGER-- AS I'M SURE YOU HAVE, MR. GOODNIGHT. I'M A CIRCUIT JUDGE. ALL I DO IS RIDE FROM TOWN TO TOWN. STRANGERS IS ALL I EVER MEET. I MYSELF DON'T TEND TO STAY IN ANY ONE PLACE FOR TOO LONG. YOU MUST BE THE SAME, I EXPECT, TO CHOOSE A LIFE LIKE THIS. I DIDN'T CHOOSE IT. [CHUCKLES] SO YOU DIDN'T MAKE YOUR WAY OUT WEST TO BRING JUSTICE TO THE GREAT UNTAMED? NO, I CAME OUT HERE LOOKING FOR REVENGE. DID YOU GET IT? I'M NOT SURE. HOW DID IT FEEL? NOT LIKE I THOUGHT IT WOULD. THEN MIGHT I ASK WHY YOU HAVEN'T RETURNED TO CHICAGO? JUST SOME OF THE PLACES I'VE BEEN, THINGS I'VE SEEN, THAT CHANGES YOU. WELL, MAYBE ONE DAY, YOU'LL FIND THE RIGHT WOMAN AND SETTLE DOWN. DON'T BE THINKING IT'S ME, 'CAUSE IT'S NOT. POINT TAKEN. [♪♪] [GUNS COCKING] I JUST WANT THE GIRL. WHY? HE'LL KILL ME IF I SAY. I'LL KILL YOU IF YOU DON'T. [RIFLE BLASTS] [RIFLE BLASTING] [TRADING GUNFIRE] FIRE IN HIS DIRECTION. DON'T SHOOT ME. [TRADING GUNFIRE] [SHOTS BLASTING] RIDE! [GUNFIRE BLASTING] WE'RE SITTING DUCKS OUT IN THE OPEN FOR THAT LONG RIFLE. IF WE CAN MAKE IT TO THIS RAVINE UP HERE, AT LEAST WE'LL HAVE A CHANCE. GO! [SHOTS BLASTING] [BULLETS WHIZ AND PING] [BULLETS CRACK AND RICOCHET] [SHOTS BLASTING] WE'RE OUT OF REAL ESTATE. WE COULD JUMP. WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? WELL, HE'S NOT GOING TO FOLLOW US. WOULD YOU MAKE THAT JUMP IF YOU WEREN'T GETTING SHOT AT? WELL, I AM GETTING SHOT AT, AND THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING TO MAKE IT-- NO! [SCREAMING] THAT'S COLD! WE'VE GOT TO MAKE IT TO THAT BOAT! [STEAMBOAT CHUGGING] YOU DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME IF I COULD SWIM. I DIDN'T REALLY THINK IT WAS GONNA MATTER. I THOUGHT THE FALL WAS GONNA KILL US. NORMALLY, WE DON'T TAKE ON PASSENGERS BETWEEN PORTS, BUT, IN THIS CASE, WE'LL BE GLAD TO ACCOMMODATE YOU, YOUR HONOR. WELL, I APPRECIATE IT. WILL YOU AND MRS. GOODNIGHT BE WANTING A FIRST-CLASS CABIN? OH, UH, TWO FIRST-CLASS CABINS, OR THE BEST YOU HAVE. I PREFER ONE CABIN. I BET YOU WOULD. IT'S FOR SAFETY. WELL, I'LL TAKE MY CHANCES. DON'T COME KNOCKING ON MY DOOR IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT COMPLAINING ABOUT RATS. CAPTAIN, ARE THERE RATS ABOARD THIS SHIP, SIR? I'M AFRAID SO, MA'AM. MOST OF THEM WEARING FANCY CLOTHES. CAPTAIN, WHEN DOES THIS BOAT DOCK IN CODY? ABOUT 12:00 TOMORROW. WE'VE A FEW STOPS IN BETWEEN, BUT SHE MAKES PRETTY GOOD TIME. I'M HOPING YOU HAVE A CASINO ON BOARD, SIR? OPEN ALL NIGHT. [♪♪] [INSISTENT POUNDING ON DOOR] GO AWAY! UH, SORRY, SIR, IT'S THE CAPTAIN. I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT. [SIGHING] OKAY. THIS COURT IS IN NOW SESSION. THE HONORABLE JOHN WILLIAM GOODNIGHT PRESIDING. THIS BETTER BE GOOD. YOU GOT ME OUT OF THE FIRST HOT BATH I'VE HAD IN ALMOST A WEEK. ALL RIGHT, WHO DID WHAT TO WHO? I FOUND THIS MAN IN MY ROOM. WELL, IT WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE. SEE, I HAD A LITTLE TOO MUCH TO DRINK AND I OPENED THE WRONG DOOR. WAS IT A MISTAKE THAT YOUR HAND WAS IN MY SUITCASE? I THOUGHT IT WAS MINE. ANYTHING MISSING FROM YOUR ROOM, MA'AM? A DIAMOND BROOCH. I ASSUME, CAPTAIN, THAT YOU'VE SEARCHED HIS PERSON AND HIS CABIN? YES. WE DIDN'T FIND A BROOCH. WE FOUND THIS. DO YOU WEAR WOMEN'S JEWELRY, SIR? I MOST CERTAINLY DO NOT. ARE YOU MARRIED? NOT YET. YOU A PIRATE? OF COURSE NOT. THEN WHAT ARE YOU DOING WITH A WOMAN'S RING AND EARRINGS? WELL, THEY'RE A GIFT. IT'S MY MOTHER'S BIRTHDAY. YOU'RE VERY GENEROUS. WELL, I LIKE TO THINK SO. I'M READY TO RULE. I'VE BEEN DRUNK A FEW TIMES, SO IT'S NOT DIFFICULT FOR ME TO ENVISION A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE ALCOHOL COULD CAUSE A MAN TO CONFUSE A ROOM, OR EVEN A SUITCASE, FOR HIS OWN. THANK YOU, JUDGE. BUT I HAVE NEVER MET A MAN, DRUNK OR SOBER, WHO WOULD BUY DIAMONDS LIKE THAT FOR HIS MOTHER. LET ME SEE THAT CANE. YOU WILL DO NO SUCH THING. OH, YES, IT PLEASES THE COURT. PRODUCE THE CANE. THANK YOU, CAPTAIN. [RATTLING] [UNSCREWING CANE HANDLE] OH... YOUR MOTHER IS A VERY LUCKY WOMAN. -I CAN EXPLAIN. -NO NEED. HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT COLD WATER? I PREFER WHISKEY. YEAH, SO DO I. UNDER THE MARITIME LAW OF THE TERRITORY OF WYOMING, I FIND YOU GUILTY. CAPTAIN, PLEASE ESCORT THE PASSENGER OVERBOARD. OVERBOARD? WELL, GENTLEMEN, LET'S NOT GET CARRIED AWAY. NOW, PUT ME DOWN! BE REASONABLE! [THIEF SPLUTTERING AND FUMING] WHAT ARE YOU, PIRATES? THIS AIN'T RIGHT! I GOT RIGHTS, YOU KNOW! I'LL GET YOU! [SCISSORS SNIP] [BRISK KNOCKING] YOU READY? WELL, I SEE YOU GOT THAT NEW DRESS. I BOUGHT IT FROM A WOMAN ONBOARD. IT'S A LITTLE TIGHT AROUND THE TOP. YEAH, I NOTICED. THAT LITTLE GUN YOU HAVE STRAPPED TO YOUR WAIST, DID YOU GET THAT FROM THE SAME WOMAN? THE CAPTAIN. HE'S AN ACCOMMODATING FELLOW. WELL, I THINK THE $20 HELPED. WHO SHOT YOU? WHAT? I KNOW WHAT A GUNSHOT WOUND LOOKS LIKE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO TALK ABOUT IT? I'D RATHER NOT. ALL RIGHT, IT WAS MY FATHER. THE ESTEEMED NATHAN TRUFFAULT. AFTER MY MOTHER DIED, HE TOOK TO BEATING ME. WHEN I WAS 13, I TRIED TO RUN AWAY, AND HE STOPPED ME WITH A BULLET, THUS THE SCAR. I'M SORRY. WELL, I RECOVERED. AND WHEN I DID, I OPENED HIS SAFE, TOOK EVERYTHING IN IT AND RAN. I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SINCE. HE MAY BE DEAD, FOR ALL I KNOW, BUT... I CAN ONLY HOPE. IS THAT WHERE YOU GOT YOUR MONEY FROM? [SIGHS HEAVILY] NO, THAT RAN OUT YEARS AGO. NOW... IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE YOU'D LIKE TO KNOW? YES. HOW DO YOU LIKE YOUR STEAK? IN A BOTTLE. NO ICE, NO GLASS. [LAUGHING AND BUSTLING CROWD] [♪♪] IS THIS SEAT FREE? MONEY PLAYS. WELL... IT'S THE QUEEN OF HEARTS. OH, HOW KIND. ARE YOU COMFORTABLE? OH, QUITE. THE PRETTY LADY DEALS. OH! WELL, UM... IS FIVE CARD STUD ALL RIGHT WITH EVERYONE? MM, IT'S BEEN GOOD TO ME ALL NIGHT. [GIGGLES] [SHUFFLING CARDS] ONE, TWO, THREE... FOUR. TEN BETS. $20. OKAY. I WILL SEE YOUR $20 AND RAISE YOU... 50. [CLEARS THROAT] YOU'RE RAISING 50 ON A SIX? UM... YES. [LAUGHING INDULGENTLY] IS THAT ALL RIGHT? MA'AM, YOU EVER PLAYED THIS BEFORE? OH, YES, MANY, MANY TIMES, WITH MY AUNT JOSEPHINE. OH. YOUR AUNT JOSEPHINE. WELL, I WOULD LOVE TO MEET YOUR AUNT JOSEPHINE. WELL, I WISH YOU COULD, BUT SHE IS RECENTLY DEPARTED. MY CONDOLENCES. HOW DID SHE DIE? PENNILESS WOULD BE MY GUESS. [SQUEALS GIRLISHLY] WELL, WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT LOVELY, LOVELY PAIR. I'M PRETTY SURE THEY HAVE BEEN. [CLEARING THROATS] I'M GONNA SAY... PUT IN... $100. WHAT DO YOU SEE? I SEE TWO SIXES. NOT THREE? NO. WELL, YOU MUST HAVE A PEACH OF A HAND. IT'S GOING TO COST YOU... $100 TO FIND OUT. REALLY? YOU IN OR OUT, SIR? I'M OUT. I'M OUT. ALL RIGHT... UM... TWO TENS. TWO TENS... $200. ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'LL SEE YOUR 200, AND I'LL RAISE YOU ANOTHER 100. I THINK YOU'RE BLUFFING. AM I? [WHISTLING NONCHALANTLY] SHOULD WE BARE OUR SOULS? TWO TENS, AND TENS BEAT SIXES. NOT THREE SIXES. [OTHER PLAYERS CHUCKLE IN DISBELIEF] [LAUGHTER] QUEEN OF HEARTS TAKES THE POT! [TIMID KNOCKING] WHO IS IT? ME. SLIDE THE MONEY UNDER THE DOOR. CAN I HAVE A WORD? RATS AGAIN? YOU WERE THE ONE THAT WANTED TO SHARE A ROOM. THAT'S BACK WHEN I HAD $400. NOW I DON'T. I CAME HERE TO APOLOGIZE. I SHOULDN'T HAVE CLEANED YOU OUT LIKE THAT. I HOPE IT WASN'T TOO PAINFUL. IT WAS. WHY, BECAUSE I'M A BETTER CARD PLAYER THAN YOU? YOUR APOLOGY NEEDS A LITTLE WORK. I'LL GIVE YOU A CHANCE TO WIN IT BACK. I GOT NOTHING LEFT, EXCEPT MY CLOTHES. YOU DON'T WANT THOSE. MAYBE I DO. I KNOW YOU DON'T TRUST ME. I KNOW YOU'RE MAD. I KNOW YOU THINK I'M A LIAR AND A CHEAT. BUT, UH, MAYBE YOU COULD FORGET ALL THAT FOR ONE NIGHT. PROBABLY NOT. I MIGHT BE WILLING TO TRY, THOUGH. [♪♪] I FEEL SAFE WITH YOU. I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER SAID THAT TO A MAN BEFORE. I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE "SAFE" WAS WHAT I WAS GOING FOR. [CHUCKLES] I MAY HAVE MISJUDGED OUR SITUATION EARLIER. MAYBE I COULD BE THE RIGHT GIRL FOR YOU. OH? WELL, WE ARE QUITE COMPANIONABLE, AND... I COULD KIND OF ENVISION US SETTLING DOWN SOMEWHERE. MAYBE GETTING A HOUSE... AND A GARDEN. I'M SICK OF HOTELS. SOMEWHERE LIKE... NEW ORLEANS, OR... ATLANTA. YOU'RE BLUFFING. WHAT... AM I SCARING YOU? SORT OF. WELL... LIFE IS SHORT. IT CAN BE LONG, TOO. [SIGHS PEACEFULLY] CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING? I WISH YOU WOULDN'T. WHO'S KATE? [SIGHS PAINFULLY] I READ HER LETTER WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR THINGS. WHEN YOU WERE GOING THROUGH MY THINGS? I WAS CURIOUS. THERE'S ANOTHER NAME FOR IT. SHE HAS LOVELY HANDWRITING, AND WORDS. I KNOW IT'S NONE OF MY BUSINESS, BUT IT DOES SEEM LIKE SHE STILL... HAS FEELINGS FOR YOU, FROM WHAT I READ. SHE'S SOMEONE I USED TO KNOW. CAN'T WE JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT? HMM. [SIGHING] ARE YOU UPSET SHE'S GETTING MARRIED? NO. WHY WOULD I BE UPSET? BECAUSE YOU KEPT HER LETTER. SHE FOUND SOMEONE THAT'LL BE THERE FOR HER. SHE DESERVES THAT. I'M SORRY. [HEAVY BOOT STEPS OUTSIDE] WHAT'S THAT SMELL? THAT'S A BAD CIGAR. JOHN... JOHN. TAKE THIS GUN, AND YOU SHOOT ANYBODY THAT COMES THROUGH THAT CABIN DOOR. EXCEPT ME. I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE FOLLOWING ME. I'M NOT AFTER YOU. SURE SHOT A LOT OF BULLETS INTO ROCKS AND TREES THIS MORNING. I'M SORRY ABOUT YOUR TRACKER. WELL, JUST HAND OVER THE GIRL, AND OUR BUSINESS IS DONE. I DON'T KNOW WHAT SHE IS TO YOU, BUT WE ARE FAR FROM DONE. I KNOW YOU KILLED THE PINKERTON AND THE DRIVER. I CAN ONLY IMAGINE WHAT YOU LAID WASTE TO IN THAT CAVALRY. THAT'S ACCUSATIONS WITH NO PROOF. I'VE GOT A SPENT SHELL FROM THAT LONG RIFLE OF YOURS. THAT'S ALL THE PROOF I NEED. I OUGHT TO PUT A BULLET IN YOU RIGHT NOW. WHAT'S STOPPING YOU? NOT MUCH. WALK. CAPTAIN, TAKE THIS MURDERING PIECE OF TRASH BELOW AND LOCK HIM UP. WHO IS HE? HE'S A DISGRACE TO THE MILITARY. YEAH, YOU DIDN'T EVEN SERVE. COWARD. [BLOW THUDS, GROANS IN PAIN] I'M SERVING NOW. THAT'S FOR THE PINKERTON. THAT'S FOR SHOOTING ME. WHY NOT JUST KILL HIM RIGHT NOW? HE'S GONNA HANG ANYWAY. WELL, THAT'LL BE THE LAW HANGIN' HIM. IF I KILLED HIM RIGHT NOW, IT'D JUST BE ME. I TELL YOU SOMETHING, THOUGH, THERE ARE TIMES I WISH I WASN'T A JUDGE. [MUTTERING] THIS IS ONE OF THEM. [CAPTAIN GROANS IN PAIN] [KNOCK ON DOOR] [COCKING GUN] [GOODNIGHT]: IT'S ME. [UNCOCKS GUN] WHAT HAPPENED? YOUR KIDNAPPER, HE'S LOCKED UP UNTIL WE DOCK. WELL, THAT'S A BIG RELIEF. YOU DON'T LOOK RELIEVED. I JUST WISH YOU'D KILLED HIM. WHY? BECAUSE DEAD MEN DON'T TALK? YOU'RE WANTED IN THREE STATES. FOUR IF YOU STAY HERE ANY LONGER. WERE YOU EVER GOING TO TELL ME? PROBABLY NOT. A TRUTHFUL SENTENCE AT LAST. I HAVE MY FAULTS. HONESTY IS NOT ONE OF THEM. MY FATHER WAS THE FIRST TO PUT A BOUNTY OUT ON ME, AND... THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW SINCE. WHAT DID YOU DO TO KNOX? OH, I HURT HIM, BUT NOT NEARLY BAD ENOUGH. I LIED, I TOOK SOME MONEY, MADE SOME PROMISES I DIDN'T KEEP. HE'S A HATEFUL MAN WHO'S DONE HATEFUL THINGS. AND IF HE WAS THE ONLY ONE YOU TOOK, MAYBE I COULD LOOK THE OTHER WAY. THE WORLD'S FULL OF BAD MEN. IT'S NOT FOR YOU TO DECIDE. WHY, BECAUSE I'M NOT A JUDGE? IT'S HARD BEING A WOMAN ALONE. THERE ARE VERY FEW WAYS TO MAKE A FORTUNE. NOT EVERYONE NEEDS A FORTUNE TO LIVE. WELL, I DO. [SCOFFS IN WONDER] YOU HAVE SOME UNUSUAL THOUGHTS. [MEEKLY] PERHAPS. BUT I NEVER DID BUSINESS WITH ANYONE WHO DIDN'T DESERVE IT. AND YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO, YOU CAN'T CON AN HONEST MAN. CONNING A DISHONEST ONE IS STILL AGAINST THE LAW. WELL, I GUESS THERE ARE WORSE THINGS. THERE ALWAYS ARE. [WOMAN SCREAMS IN HORROR] JOHN, WAIT! [GUNSHOT BLASTS] GOODNIGHT, WHERE'S THAT HARLOT? [BULLETS RICOCHET] [TRADING GUNFIRE] [SHOUTING IN PROTEST] IS THAT HOW YOU DO IT IN THE CAVALRY, HIDE BEHIND WOMEN? LET HER GO NOW... YOU THINK SHE'S SWEET ON YOU? SHE TOLD ME SHE LOVED ME, TOO. SHE SAID SHE WANTED TO SETTLE DOWN TO ATLANTA, START A FAMILY. SHOOT HIM. HE CAN'T, SWEETHEART. HE'S FOND OF YOU. JOHN, I AM BEGGING YOU, KILL HIM RIGHT NOW. GO AHEAD AND PULL THAT TRIGGER. SHE'LL BE MY BRIDE IN HELL. HE'S GOING TO KILL ME ANYWAY, JOHN! JUST SHOOT! GO AHEAD, TAKE YOUR SHOT, SEE WHAT HAPPENS. ALL RIGHT. THE GUN'S DOWN. [CHUCKLES] FOOL. [SHOTS BLASTING] [BLOWS THUD HEAVILY] [EMPTY GUN CLICKING] [SHOT BLASTS] [LUCY SCREAMS] NO! JOHN! [PISTOL BUTT SMACKS] NO-- [SCREAMS] YOUR LUCK RAN OUT. FATE FINALLY CAUGHT UP TO YOU. [SHOTS BLAST] [WINCING IN PAIN] OUCH. OH... THAT'S THE BEST $62 I EVER SPENT. OW. [♪♪] AM I IN HEAVEN OR HELL? NEITHER ONE YET. THAT BULLET HIT THE PINKERTON'S BADGE THAT WAS IN YOUR POCKET. SAVED BY THE LAW. I GUESS WE BOTH WERE. HERE, THE DOCTOR SAID YOU'VE GOT SOME REAL BAD BRUISED RIBS. THEY'RE GOING TO HURT FOR A WHILE. IT DOES. KNOX IS DEAD. THAT'S SOMETHING. IT DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING. I KNOW. SO... SHOULD I CALL YOU LUCY OR ALICE? WHICHEVER YOU PREFER. I'LL STICK WITH LUCY. YOU GOING TO TURN ME IN? YOU HAVE REMORSE FOR YOUR ACTS? NO. YOU'RE NOT HELPING YOUR CASE ANY. YOU WANTED THE TRUTH. I'M TIRED OF LYING. ARE YOU TIRED OF RUNNING? WELL... I'VE BEEN AT IT A LONG TIME. IT'S ALL I'VE KNOWN, BUT, YEAH, I AM TIRED. THINGS COULD BE DIFFERENT BETWEEN US. I'D LIKE THAT. IF YOU PAY YOUR DEBT TO SOCIETY, YOU GET A CLEAN SLATE. OR YOU COULD JUST SAY I GOT AWAY AND WE COULD MEET UP AGAIN LATER. [CHUCKLES PAINFULLY] I CAN'T SAY I'M NOT TEMPTED. WELL... WHY DON'T YOU SLEEP ON THAT THOUGHT. [GROANS] WHAT WAS IN THAT WHISKEY? LAUDANUM. YOU DRUGGED ME? THE DOCTOR SAID IT WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOUR PAIN. YOU JUST SLEEP NOW. AND WHEN I WAKE UP, YOU WON'T BE HERE, IS THAT IT? SHH, JUST REST. [GROANS GROGGILY] [♪♪] WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR OTHER DRESS? I LIKED IT. YEAH, BUT THIS ONE'S MINE. I KIND OF FIGURED YOU FOR THE RIVER. I CONSIDERED IT, BUT THEN YOU'D HAVE TO GO IN AFTER ME, AND THAT WATER'S COLD. ALWAYS THINKING OF OTHERS. I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID TO ME. I'M TURNING MYSELF IN. YOU SHOULD TELL ME THAT THAT'S NOT A MISTAKE. I CAN'T DO THAT, BUT I DO KNOW A JUDGE WHO MIGHT TAKE IT EASY ON YOU. IS NOW A GOOD TIME? NO, LET'S WAIT A BIT. [♪♪] [♪♪]
