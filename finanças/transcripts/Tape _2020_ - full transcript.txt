[CHUCKLES] The sign-up sheet is here. I trust that you found your names and initialed. Please make sure your email address is correct, and be sure to add your home address as well, and we will start seeing you in a few moments. Yes, my dear. - My name isn't on the list. - Where did you submit? WOMAN 1: Through the notice on casting networks. LUX: Did you receive an email? WOMAN 1: Yes. LUX: And did you respond? WOMAN 1: I didn't know I was supposed to. LUX: Yes, you were. I'm sorry. WOMAN: Oh. WOMAN 2: Hey. Are you okay? I didn't know I was supposed to respond. Did you? WOMAN 2: Yeah, it was in the email. WOMAN 1: I didn't see it there. WOMAN 2: I... I have it. Um... Right here. Okay. Um... "To complete your submission, you must perform all the following steps "in order to receive an invitation for audition. "Step one, send an email." Blah, blah, blah. "You must be on our guest list in order to enter the audition area. "If you don't receive a confirmation, please do not show up for audition. "This confirmation only applies to adult applicants "eighteen years old." How old are you? I'm 18. Fifteen. WOMAN 2: "The legal guardian of the child "must perform these steps as indicated. "Step one. Call us toll-free 866..." Did your mom call? No, she wouldn't. I thought, maybe I could sneak in anyway. Hey, it's okay. You're very beautiful. I'm sure you're really talented. - You'll get your chance. - [DOOR OPENS] - LUX: Pearl Osborne. - Yes, that's me. LUX: Come on. - Good luck. - Thanks. This is Jenny. She's gonna be reading with you. - Hi. Nice to meet you. - You, too. Step in front of the camera. - Okay. State your name. - Pearl Osborne. LUX: Hi, Pearl. Have a seat. Okay, before we begin, maybe you could just tell us why you think you are the perfect candidate for this project? I can't tell you how grateful I am for this opportunity. Um... My name's Pearl Osborne and I'm an actor. And... I think I'm the perfect candidate for this project, because I have the talent and training from NYU. Um... But I've been struggling... a bit with the business aspect of acting. I need the tools, like better photographs and... whatever else... The makeover offers and... I need to learn how to market myself, so I can have the career I've always dreamed of. I've had a lot of ups and downs since I decided to be an actor. And, uh... I understand that I have a lifetime of more ups and downs if I continue with this career. But I'd really like a real shot at it. [DOOR OPENS] We'll see Faye Mara next. Hey, Faye. - How'd it go? - Oh, my God. I don't know. Uh, good, I think. He seemed to like me. I mean, he said he'd be sending out an email for callbacks later in the week, so... I'm nervous and excited! What about you? Are you nervous and excited? I'm very excited. Uh, did you do the sides or a monologue? - Uh, sides. You? - A monologue. - What from? - Titus from Titus Andronicus. - Well, what's that? - Uh, Shakespeare. I don't know that play very well. This is my favorite. You should watch the Julie Taymor version. Oh, really. That's the one where, um, the girl gets raped and she... The guys who rape her, they cut off her tongue so she can't tell anyone, and are wrists as well, so she can't write who they are either? - Yeah. - I love Julie Taymor. Yeah. My teacher saw the original production she did in just a little theater off Broadway. Look where she is now. - Exactly. - You never know, right? - Even a shitty reality TV show. - Totally. Um... - Well, good luck. - Thanks. You, too. I mean, they only take... six, but, maybe we'll be lucky, and we'll... - ...see you tomorrow. - Hope so. - Bye. - Bye. [MUSIC PLAYING] [TRAFFIC BUSTLING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] [HONKING] WOMAN: I know. I got three callbacks in one week. I know, I can't even believe it. No, it's just... Thank you for believing. I just wanna lick your face. I love you so much. Oh... I was just so close to giving up, you know, and... I'm just... I'm so excited. Yeah. [CONTINUES TALKING INDISTINCTLY] [WOMEN LAUGHING] - All right. - WOMAN: Yeah, you know... - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! - Hey! So worried you were gonna be late. - Oh, hey! - Hi. - How are you? You made it. - Yeah. Did you all get sent the oil of the... commercial? - Yeah. - So freaking cheesy. So are we doing that same commercial, - or is he giving us sides? - I think we get new sides, but he wants a similar presentation... - Wait. I don't think I saw it. - Here. One sec. Do you need to spend a fortune to get a better anti-aging face cream? "Absolutely not" says the research... WOMAN 1: Oh, yeah. I can do that. No problem. WOMAN 2: They'll do that if they have to, right? I bet you just don't really like the idea of commercials and American capitalism machinery. I just want to do something more meaningful with my talent, you know? Films, TV... But, you know... I'll do it. [LAUGHS] I'll do whatever it takes. I'll play the game. Whatever it takes. We'll get to do meaningful work. I mean, he cast Gossip Girl, Law and Order, but, also some, like, serious, unique features. What did you bring for your select bodywear? Oh, my God! They are so strict. Did you read? He said no thongs or see-through material. You'll be disqualified from auditioning. What are they? Evangelicals? All I own are thongs. WOMAN 1: Yeah, me too. Black ones. I had to go buy a new bikini. WOMAN 2: Oh, my God, Guys. Here he comes. WOMAN 3: Okay. He's coming. I see him. What are you all doing down here? - WOMAN: The door's locked. - Did you buzz? Yeah, I did. I guess they're late. Ah, well, we can start down here. Okay. Well, first of all congratulations to you all. Only four of you will emerge victorious today, but now that I believe in each and every one of you, that's why you're here. If today is not a success for you, don't think for a moment that this is the end of our working relationship. I actually have a management company. So we can discuss the possibility of working together, um, in the future, but let's just get through today, okay? So this last step of the process will evaluate form and composition, commercial blocking and presentation. Now we're gonna start first with form and composition. You're gonna demonstrate your physical stature by walking from one end of the studio to the other, in your select bodywear. [WOMEN LAUGHING] You will then change into the second outfit of the day, for the commercial portion of the audition. I hope you read my notes and brought with you a suitable commercial outfit... Like a pencil-skirt, suit-pants, or a collard dress shirt. Great. The aim of the commercial is to feel like a product presentation. Did you background research on infomercials and product demonstrations as I asked? Great. Whatever it is you've learned through formal training will be replaced on the spot. The real world of acting and film and television is very different than what you've learned through formal training. The real world is much more about connection, chemistry and socialization than anything you've learned academically. Now, I come from the old-school of thought that states that, "To test the strength of something, "you throw it in the fire and you see if it burns." So I'm looking for that phoenix among you that will rise from the ashes and transcend my trial by fire. - Me. Pick me. - [CHUCKLES] Just wait. - Oh, here we go. - So sorry. - So sorry to keep you waiting. - LUX: That's okay. I am so sorry. You can go over a little. You have the same space you used last time and, uh... I don't think anyone's entered after you. - Sorry. - Oh, here we go. - Sorry. Sorry. - All right. Okay. I know we're here a little early today, but there's going to be neighboring auditions going on. Please try not to be a distraction in the hallways. All right, ladies. Well, welcome to this semifinals audition. You are all one audition away... PEARL: Are you coming? ROSA: Actually, I didn't get a callback. - PEARL: Well, why are you here? - I don't know, I... thought I could get him to reconsider, but I changed my mind. I think that's a good idea. Why don't you come in? Totally! That's a great idea. Only four are selected. Also, I think he likes the long hair. Look at you. You should run. Come on. I'll talk to him with you. ROSA: No. No! Sorry. No, I'm sorry. I'm just... Just angry. It's a fucked-up business. With so much luck... It's so unfair. So many talented people who never get to work. Yeah. Well, good luck.

Don't be upset. - I just wanted it, so... - I know. I know. But we could only take four, you know, women for this... For this show. I think you're really talented. Like, too talented for a reality show. Honestly. What you said about management? - It was so great. - That's why I'm out here. I'm really interested in working with you. - Yeah? - Yeah. - I really need that. - Yeah. Yeah. I, um... I have what's called a "protege program" that I think you might be perfect for. Okay. That sounds great. That sounds great. Well, I'll tell you how it works. - You're my protege. - ROSA: Shit! Someone under the patronage, protection and care of a person that's interested in his or her... career or welfare. Traditionally, you know, that's how artists used to develop their crafts. The person responsible for the protege is called a patron. Responsibility of the patron is to financially back the career aspirations and development, of the protege. So... I... I'd like to refer to myself more as a patron - than as a manager. - You know, that sounds great. You have, like, a certain set of responsibilities to me, as your patron. But your chief responsibility would be to pursue your career with extraordinary diligence and zeal. And my responsibility would be to... pursue such a huge undertaking. - So... - It sounds amazing. Yeah. I have your email address. I'll send you, you know, some background information on me and my management company. Uh, we'll probably do a screen test before we make any final decisions. - Totally. - True. Great. Yeah, well... Oh, my gosh. Thank you. Thank you so much. - All right. Okay. - Okay. - Take care of yourself, okay? - Yeah. Okay. - Uh, bye. - Bye. Do I know you? [MUSIC PLAYING] PEARL: I know. I know. Yeah. It's like I've been tryingfor so long and it's finally... It's finally happening. Yeah. Here, I'll put you on speaker. I'll read you what he sent me. Okay. Are you there? Yeah. So he says, "Before we move onto form "a possible relationship as patron and protege, "I would like to afford you the opportunity "to learn about my background in respect to the industry. "I have over ten years experience in this industry." - Okay, Mom, this is so cool. - MOM: Yeah. "I've done castings for Cosmopolitan, Jane, Maxim, FHM... Joe, The Village Boys, 30 Rock, Law & Order Chappelle's Show, Gossip Girl. Music videos, Co-Ed Confidentials Forbidden Science, ABC's Wife Swap, major features, independent features and live performance venuessuch as the Metropolitan Opera. [PEARL'S MOM SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY] There's more, but you get the gist. Yeah. I think he just wants to meet one more time at a coffee shop, and do a script analysis of the scene, and then... [CHUCKLES] ...screen test and, like... I guess if he still... If he still likes my work, then he'll sign me and start sending me out on things. I know. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll let you go. I'm sorry. No, thank you. Okay. I love you. Yeah, I love you, too. Okay. Bye. ROSA: Pearl, I just wanted to talk to you. Uh... How do you know where I live? ROSA: I'm sorry. I... You're freaking me out. I just wanted to talk to you. - Stop following. - It's really important. - Stop following me! - I need to talk to you. ROSA: Fuck! [POP MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY] - Lux. - Hey, James. How're you doing, man? - I'm great. - Good to see you. This is Pearl. This is James' place. PEARL: It's so nice here. Lux is one of my most loyal customers. He's been meeting his clients here for years. And I'm very grateful. Oh, you make it really easy. It's the best coffee in town, I gotta tell you. - This is Pearl. - Hi. She's, uh, a very talented young actress. One of these days, I'll convince him to represent me. No, I'm ready when you are, man. - Still polishing my monologue. - This is the never-ending part. All right. Well, good luck to you. - See you soon. - Thanks, man. Okay. So is he an actor? Oh, well, you know the Europe joke. It's like, if someone says they're an actor, you ask them, "What restaurant?" PEARL: Yeah. Okay. So here is... This is Angela. Your character. She is, uh... working in a small diner. It's the last of its kind in a city that never sleeps. Um, she and her husband, Michael... High school sweethearts, whose marriage is being tested by their dire economic circumstances. Angela... desperately loves Michael, but she can't stand his British ways. She's a romantic. Loves to read fairy-tale novels. - [PEARL LAUGHS] - Enchanted places with flawless characters and superhuman virtues. Whereas Michael is a dreamer, but a traditionalist. He believes in the honor of a man to sacrifice himself for his family. Okay. Cool! I'm sure you, um, studied Actions at school, right? - Yeah. - Good, 'cause I think that being able to put in action is the essential tool you bring to your work. - I agree completely. - Can you play an action? [BOTH LAUGH] Now the second part of the script is mostly choreography, which we can do when we get to set. PEARL: Okay. Sounds good. I want you to take this very seriously, and put your best foot forward by giving the best performance that you're capable of giving. Totally, I... This is all that I'm gonna look at until spring test, okay? I will... I will live it, breathe it, sleep it, dream it... Good. In offering you this opportunity, I'm silently asking you to prove to me that my hunch about you, and, uh... potential, I feel like you hold is true, and I'm not wasting my time in investing behind you. - Yeah, I know. - And so, if you see me holding a hard line with you, it is only because I am fully vested in the talents I take on and decide to develop and guide. I understand completely and I... I just want you to know that I'm really grateful for this opportunity, and I really appreciate everything you're doing for me and for believing in me. So how about I give you the weekend to rehearse, and, uh, we can meet up on Monday morning and... - Okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. Perfect. -10:00 a.m.? - Perfect. - Okay. So we'll meet here, and then we can walk over - to the location. - Okay. We're gonna be using an actual set, by the way. - It's a matter of process. Yeah. - Oh, wow. [MACHINERY WHIRRING] LUX: I'd like to use, um, the same procedures as principal photography, but on a smaller scale. - Okay? - PEARL: Sounds perfect. Okay, great. So I will see you Monday morning. - Mm-hmm. - Bright and early 10:00 a.m. PEARL: Yup. [LAUGHS] Good luck with your studying. - Thank you. Thank you so much. - See you. All right. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] WOMAN: It was very traumatic. I've had rough sex before, but this was terrifying. How did you two meet? He walked into this club right here... Out of this office building and into the club. And he said he'd been a fan for a long time. And that he loved watching my very first scene in Cream. I think that after I tell my story, there'll probably be a lot more girls after me. I should really hope that his wife leaves him and takes his children away from him, and leaves him a lonely, bitter man. It was consensual, right? - [TRAFFIC NOISE] - Well, not being beat up. REPORTER: But you weren't beat up. Well, not bruises, but he forced me to have sex without a condom. REPORTER: How much were you paid? I wasn't paid. I was gifted. REPORTER: How much? $1,500. And you agreed to this? DAISY: Yes. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - Hi. - ROSA: Hi, Dawn. I have an update for you. Hey. You remember me? I was here a few weeks ago with a friend...

LUX: It's a point where you look at the world, Pearl. What do you think about the world? You do have the power and you can climb it. PEARL: I could buy it. Oh there's nothing to buy. You just go to the book store and read the chapter titles. They're interesting and useful. No need to even get the book. PEARL: I read great. LUX: You can embrace power now. PEARL: I want to. - I can embrace power. - I know you can. What about The Book of the Courtier? Do you remember, in the... In The Book of the Courtier... PEARL: The one from like 1500? LUX: Yeah, there's a lot of really useful information out there. PEARL: Oh, that's crazy! We studied that at NYU. It's about women and power and how a woman can behave to attract the attention of the room. LUX: That's right. It's real. It's out there. Just think about it. How do you mean? Do you remember in The Book of the Courtier, the term Sprezzatura? PEARL: Sprezzatura? That's what you must call today, as an actress. That certain nonchalance so as to conceal all art and make whatever it is you do or say appear without any effort. - Without any thought at all. - That's hard. LUX: It is, but that thing you studied is real. But you can bring it into your life. It's a feminist act. It's a kind of a power. It's better than acting. PEARL: Completely. When I was at NYU, we also studied Veronica Franco. - Amazing. - LUX: And you know that Veronica Franco defended herself in front of the Inquisition on charges of witchcraft with great dignity. She used her power in the most threatening situation. PEARL: And they dropped the charges. LUX: Exactly. LUX: Ah. Here we are. PEARL: Wow. LUX: Oh, uh, no shoes on the carpet. Don't mind. Only socks on the carpet. PEARL: Wait. This is so cool. LUX: Yeah. The owner John, is a brilliant artist. He does his photoshoots here and stuff. And so, he has all these different setups that I can then do my screen tests on. So... I think his cousin owns the building, or the block, or something like that. - Oh, wow! These are beautiful. - LUX: Yeah, it's brilliant. Why don't you make yourself comfortable? I'll start setting up. Okay. So the substantive result you should expect from this screening will be a talent profile report. It's this document, but it's actual recommendations for enhancing your strengthsand overcoming your weaknesses. My role as a talent producer concerns both your on-cameraand your off-camera development. Some of my tactics, methods and strategies will go against everything you know about the entertainment industry and the craft of acting in general. But where the result is paramount... and the end justifies the need. Following my method of development will get you where you need to go in the quickest and least expensive route... possible. The route has a cost. This route is not for the modest. It's not for the meek. It's not for the moral. It is not for the innocent-hearted. If you're not willing to go and fight ruthlessly for what you believe is your birthright, then there's no point in us going any further. Pearl, I'm telling you this now because I'm trying accelerate the natural conclusion of this exercise. Pearl, this... This screening is gonna be a turning point for you. There'll be no more dragging your feet and holding onto superficial comfort and safety. This challenge is gonna push youoff the proverbial cliff and either you're going to fly, or you're going to sink into the abyss of... stale mediocrity and... misery. Shit. Okay. Come on. Let's work on this. Okay. Are you acting with me? Yeah. I... You know, I... I just figured it was easier if I just set up the camera and work with you. There's just too much explaining to do, you know what I mean? I want this to be just about you. But how're you gonna work with me? To direct and act. I'm taping. Right, okay. Yeah. - Sit right there. - Mm-hmm. Do you have your lines memorized? I think so. Okay. Great. So we're gonna start with you, here at the table. And then you can use your instinct or intuition to move between the kitchen and the table as you want. And at a certain point, I'm gonna stop, and then, reposition the camera there, by the bathroom, 'cause then, of course I'm gonnastorm into the bathroom, right? And again, you can use your instinct and intuition to bring you back over there, but you have to be outside that door before I tell you to shut up. And then, I'll come out of the bathroom and we will finish the rest of the scene - on camera. - Okay. - Are you ready? - Yeah, give me... one moment. Sure. [EXHALES] - Do you mind if... - Of course. LUX: All yours. Ready? Yeah. [CAMERA BEEPS] [LUX EXHALING DEEPLY] Okay. [CLEARS THROAT] Action. [CLAPS] [SHOUTING] When are you gonna start the dinner? Not until we finish talking about this. Okay. Look, honey. I know you're upset about the money, but... But goddamn it, Michael. I asked my brother. What did you expect me to do? Now you want my opinion after you take $1,200 out of our savings account for the faccabrute you call a brother! Now she wants my opinion. My God! You know something? You're a real piece of work. - [MOUTHING] - PEARL: Michael, please. LUX: Please? Please? What do you want me to say? What do you want me to do here? PEARL: Okay. It was an emergency. What did you expect me to do? It was my brother. - Can't just let him go to jail. - I couldn't justlet my brother go to jail. Seriously! What did you expect me to do? What did you expect me to do, honestly? - [OBJECTS CLATTERING] - PEARL: God! Okay, great. So hold there, and then I'm gonna... I'll move the camera. - And then you can go. - Okay. [HUMMING SOFTLY] LUX: And, action. What about the time your sister needed money for her abortion? - LUX: You shut your mouth! - Okay. Did... Did I say anything to you then? Okay? And didn't that money come out of our joint account? LUX: You shut up about my sister! [DOOR SLAMS] I said, shut your mouth, Angela. If you bring my sister into this one more time, I will wipe the floor with that filthy... - With that filthy mouth of yours! - Oh, my God, Michael. Here I am, okay? Wipe my mouth on the fucking floor! I'd love to see you try. Who do you think you are, Michael? You think you're so big and strong? Well, make me move, okay? - What did you say? - PEARL: I said, make me move. Say it again. - Come on. Say it again! - Michael... And cut. PEARL: It got a little more real than I was expecting. LUX: Are you okay? Did I hurt you? - Are you sure? - No, no, no. I'm fine. LUX: Okay. I... I was hoping you'd say that, because I think you were brilliant, and I was hoping that you could handle that. Any director's gonna push for something - to feel that real.[CHUCKLES] - No, it's cool. - LUX: Yeah? - Yeah. LUX: Okay. Well, do you wanna take a look at it? I think we got it, - but we can take a look at it. - Sure. LUX: Okay. Great. When are you gonna start the dinner? PEARL: Not until we finish talking about this. Honey, look. I know you're upset about the money, but, damn it, Michael! Eddie is my brother. What did you expect me to do? LUX: Now you want my opinion after you took $1,200 out of our joint savings account? I mean, are you fucking kidding me? - LUX: Now! - So bad. - Such a bad fucking actor. - What were you thinking? Shut your mouth! PEARL: Well, didn't that money come out of our joint account? LUX: I said, shut your mouth! If I hear my sister's name come out of your mouth one more time, Angela, I'm gonna wipe this floor clean with that filthy mouth of yours! PEARL: Here I am, Michael. Wipe my mouth on the fucking floor! I'd love to see you try. I'd love to see you try it. LUX: You kiss really well on camera. I mean, most people don't know how to kiss on camera, but you do. You know how to hold your face, how to hold your jaw. PEARL: It's just because I practiced kissing myself all the time, in front of the mirror. [BOTH LAUGH] LUX: I think we got it. Do you wanna change into the robe? PEARL: Yeah, got it, but shouldn't we block it first? No, I think you should go change into the robe, because I'll wanna see the light hitting your skin. It will be different than the light hitting the material of the robe. PEARL: I didn't know that I was gonna be nude. [PEARL CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY] Of course you're gonna be nude. I mean, 90 percent of the things that I'm gonna try and send you on will require nudity. I mean... Look, when you watch movies, you see women your age... I mean... Have you ever seen a woman your age in a movie, that isn't naked at some point? - PEARL: That's true, sadly. - Yeah, sadly, but, I mean, this is the business we work in, you know? But remember, you know... sprezzatura! Use it. Use... Use that power. Claim it, you know? Be smarter than them. Own the room. Own your power. PEARL: Well, I'll be... I'll be right back. Okay. [DOOR OPENS] [EXHALES] Oh, my gosh! I can't complete this! I first would like to thank my mom... [SOBS] ...for supporting me. Of course, I'd like to thank the Academy... [EXHALES HEAVILY] You want this. You want this. [SOFTLY] You can do this. Hey. Oh, hey. Great. So you can just sit on the edge of the bed, uh, you can keep your robe on while I find your marks. Where do you want my outline? Um, left or right camera? Just right here is fine. I just want to make sure that the frame works when, uh... when you slide back on to the bed. So can you slide back on the beduntil you reach the pillows? Yeah. [OBJECT CLATTERING] - Shit. - LUX: Okay. Okay. Great. Um, and can you... bend your knees and use your feet to push back? - Sure. - Great. Like... - that? - Exactly like that? Great. So... lips pouting, chest out... Seduce me with your powers. Sprezzatura,right? And with that same attitude... I'm gonna have you... slide all the way back, and then you're going to slide onto your right side. And then you're gonna slip your robe open. Oh, great. So my fat ass can be ready for the camera. That's really self-deprecating. I'm not really interested in working with an actress that I have to constantly reassure and pump up. I don't wanna work with someone I have to constantly reinforce. Look. If you don't believe in yourself, this is not gonna work. I... I can do it. Sure? I can do it. Okay. Do you wanna do a rehearsal, or you wanna just jump right in? Well... What's the choreography? You're gonna start out on the edge of the bed like you did. - Give me one second. - Of course. - Okay. - Okay. You're gonna start there, and then you're goingto slide back on the bed, right? You're gonna seduce me with your power. You're gonna call me with your body. - Mm-hmm. - And you're gonna take a beat, and then you're going to slide over onto your right side, like you're teasing me, right? And then I'm gonna come over onto the bed from this side... And then... I'm gonna climb on top of you, and that's when we start to make love. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. I just... - All right. - [CAMERA FALLS] - I just... - ROSA: Fuck! - LUX: Wait, wait, wait... - No! Wait. I did communicate This was a sex scene. Just... PEARL: Sorry. I just, um... LUX: I can't fucking do this. All right... You knew you were gonna have sex on camera. This is the most important part of any of the screen tests I run for any of my clients. As a performer, I need to know you have the capacity. As a performer, you have the capacity to do this. I... I understand that. It's... It's just not what I was expecting. Well, I'm not forcing you to do this. I'm not begging you to be my client. You can... [DISTORTED VOICE] ...do whatever you want, you know? I mean, it's up to you, really. It's your choice. - You're free to leave... - No, no, no. - ...do whatever you want. It's your choice. - I wanna do it. - It's your choice. - I wanna do it. LUX: Are you sure? Yup. I wanna do it. Okay. [BELT UNBUCKLING] I'm not gonna use lube in the scene, 'cause I don't think it's sexy. But I thought I would use a little bit beforehand, so you feel, you know, more comfortable. Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Uh... - What're you talking about? - [SCOFFS] You're making the choice to be my protege. You must practice the ancient art of glamour. You must begin acting before you even get into the casting room. As a woman, you have a lot of hidden powers that have been burnt out of you through socialization. This being a patriarchy, it behooves the current order to suppress those secret powers that are so intrinsic to the female gender. Pearl. An astute player will use every natural advantage they have to win the game, and to have a life of comfort and enjoyment. At the end of the day, your love for the performing arts must become a conduit for releasing you from the liabilities of life, like paying rent and bills, and affording you a lifestyle of comfort and enjoyment. If you don't understand what I'm talking about, then... We're not on the same page, and we don't have to go any further. You can take whatever it is that you learned from me and you can do whatever you want with it. But... If you understand what I'm talking about, then through my knowledge of the secret arts, both ancient and modern, I can position you in this business, and in life, to have everything you want. Prosperity, enjoyment... Just please stop talking. [CRYING] I'm sorry. I just need a minute. That's fine. As my protege, you can... Just stop talking! [EXHALES] Fuck! Where's the fucking buzzer? Fuck! [EXHALES HEAVILY] PEARL: What time is it? It's one o'clock. Hi. Thank you. Hey! - Sorry, the buzzer doesn't work. - Is this yours? Yeah. Um, sorry. - Uh, what do I owe you? - $22.16. I am so sorry. I don't have enough for a tip, but I'll come by your restaurant later. I... I promise. That's $22. Thank you. Thanks. [GRUNTS] Hey. Hey, what're you doing in my backyard? ROSA: I'm a friend of Lux's. - He told me to wait here for him. - You know Lux? ROSA: Yeah, he's a friend. - All right. Whatever. - Thank you. May I sit? May I speak? You see that? You took charge. You took the power. You stopped me. You made me silent. That's what I wanna see out of you. You're in control of both of us. ROSA: Uh, did you do the sides or a monologue? PEARL: Uh, sides. You? ROSA: A monologue. - PEARL: What from? - Titus from Titus Andronicus. PEARL: Oh, I don't know that play very well. [VIDEO PLAYBACK SOUND] Wait, that's the one where the girl gets raped and the guys who rape her cut out her tongue, so she can't say anything and cut off her wrists so she can't write who it was either? - ROSA: Yeah. - I love Julie Taymor. - [INDISTINCT CHATTER] - [LAUGHTER] And if thy tongue can speak, Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravished thee. Write down thy mind. MAN: Why does love speak to me? May I speak? Yeah. I wanna show you a scene from Monster's Ball. Okay. You ever seen Monster's Ball? No. [WOMAN MOANING IN PLEASURE ON VIDEO] - She won an Oscar for this. - [WOMAN CONTINUES MOANING] You're going to have to be able to do this. I feel like people can't have real sex in movies. No. No, no, look at her. There's no way that's not real. At the bare minimum, you're going to have to be able to do this, if you want a career in Hollywood, much less win an Oscar. I need to think about it. Let me show you some of my other clients who've had great success with me, and they've gone through this exact same procedure. Let me show you... Motherfucker! PEARL: Oh, I know her. LUX: You do? PEARL: Yeah. She was at your audition. LUX: No. There was a lot of brunettes there that day. PEARL: Are you sure? LUX: I'm positive. PEARL: That's cool. She's nowhere near as talented as you are. Are you serious? I'm sorry, - but you get it? - I get it. This is what you want for your career? PEARL: Yes. Then we have to do this for your screen test if that's the career that you want. Look. The door is open. It is your choice. You can get up and leave right now. But either we have sex on tape, and we go for it, or we don't. And this all goes away. It makes no difference to me. It's totally up to you. It is your choice. PEARL: I know. I know. I know... Look at me. If I was fucked up and perverted, I'd be sweating right now and aroused. But I'm not. This is about the work. I get that. And? And it's not what I was expecting, so... You can understand why it's taking me a moment to consider this. Of course. I would never want you to do anything you don't feel comfortable doing. Look at all those HBO shows. There's so much sex and nudity. If you're going to book work, you have to learn to be comfortable with your body and having sex on camera. Look, you're free to leave back to your old life, but I'm offering you something different. I'm offering you something new. Think about it. What have done since you graduated Acting school? [BREATHING HEAVILY] [WIND BLOWING] [BREATHING HEAVILY] [THUNDER RUMBLES] [AIRPLANE WHIRRING BY] LUX: May I speak? PEARL: Yeah. LUX: Mind if I turn another light on? PEARL: No. [SHEET RUSTLING] [FOOTSTEPS] [ELECTRICITY BUZZING] May I speak? Yeah. You like me asking for permission? You like having the power? Yeah. Yeah. It's amazing. Watching you do this. It's amazing watching you claim your power. I don't know that could, um... I mean, that could be right. It's like I know exactly what my life's going to be like if I leave right now, but I don't know what's on the other side of this. You can leave. And go back to my boring old life. [SIGHING WISTFULLY] I've had sex with strangers for less than this, like bad, awkward sex. Like that... That I've done. I mean, that's something that I've done, before. [EXHALES HEAVILY] So, all I have to do is have sex with you? Uh, fuck it. [LAUGHS] There's one problem. I'm... I'm on my period. That's okay. It might not be. I wouldn't worry about it. Let's just see how it goes. I think I can work with that. I'll be right back. [WATER RUNNING] [FLUSHING] PEARL: Hey, what is this? - LUX: I have no idea. - It's me, motherfucker. Would you kindly step in front of the camera and state your name? Pearl Osborne. Great. And, if you can state that you are of sound mind and body, that you've not been drugged, you're not drunk, and that you're not being forced to make this tape. Um, I'm full of sound mind and body. And I am... I've not been drugged, and I'm not drunk, though I... Though I wish I was. Sorry. Um... I've not been forced in any way to make this tape. Fuck, no. [SIGHS IN EXASPERATION] I've changed my mind. Stop. LUX: Right here. I'll take your robe. And, I'll put on the condom. Remember, they are lovers. I have to believe - that Angela loves Michael... - What the fuck am I doing? - I have to stop this. - LUX: ...and desperately want to make love. And, action. PEARL: [LAUGHING] Sorry. Sorry. LUX: All right, let's start this again. [KISSES] [PEARL BREATHES HEAVILY] [MOANING] [MOANING CONTINUES] Never mind. [PEARL MOANS LOUDLY] PEARL: Oh, yeah. - Oh, yeah. - [LUX GRUNTS] [BOTH MOANING] PEARL: Oh, yeah. [BREATHING HEAVILY] I'm sorry. [SOBBING] I'm sorry. [LUX GRUNTING] [SOBBING] [LUX BREATHING RAPIDLY] [BOTH PANTING] [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] LUX: [SIGHS] Okay. That was great. Now, we just need to get some other angles. Let me, um... Let me move the camera and lock you on top of me, coming. PEARL: There's a little blood. That's okay. PEARL: Let me put underwear on it. Do you have to be under me? I can just pretend to be on top. LUX: That'll work. [PEARL LAUGHING] Okay, hold. Hold on. - I'm sorry. - LUX: Let's start this again. Remember,sprezzatura. [BREATHING HEAVILY] Pearl Osborne. Hi, my name is Rosa Torano. I'm of full sound mind and body. I have not been drugged. I'm not drunk. I've not been forced in any way - to make this tape. - LUX: Great. - We got it. - PEARL: Cool, I did it. - LUX: Yeah, you did. - [PEARL LAUGHS] Um, okay. Uh, let me... Let me clean this up. Would it be okay if I just pull the sheet off and wash it in the sink? LUX: Of course. Thank you. ["TAKE ME HOME" BY LESLIE ANNE GRAVES PLAYS] [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] [NEWS PLAYING ON TV] NEWSREADER: ...into the development of a high-end box stock. [CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY] - Thank you. - LUX: Thank you. - Cheers to you. - Cheers. LUX: Mmm. - What's this? - That's your contract. Oh, my God. Really? Yeah. You were amazing. So, all you have to do is sign it, and return in with your W-9 and we start getting out there. PEARL: Oh, my God. - I'm so grateful. - LUX: You did this. I think this is going to be a huge deal for you. I have to call my mom. Thank you. What the fuck are you doing? I told you to leave me alone and stop following me. This isn't about you. Please leave, miss. - No, I don't think I can. - [BOTH EXCLAIMS IN HORROR] LUX: What the fuck is this? Everything is going to be okay. Get the fuck out of here! ROSA: Nobody move. Give her the tape. It's not a tape, you moron, it's a memory card. Give it to her! Fuck you, bitch. [SLAMS] I thought you said you were an actress. I am. You lied to me. You said you... You did a monologue from Titus. "Come, come, Lavinia, "look, thy foe is bound. "Stop his mouth, "Let him not speak to me..." What do you want? "But let him hear what fearful words I utter! "O villain! "Here stands the spring "whom you have stained with mud, "this goodly summer with your winter mixed. "Inhuman traitor, "you constrained and forced. "What would you say if I should let you speak? "Villain, for shame you could not beg for grace." [SOBBING] "Hark, wretch! "How I mean to martyr you." What do you want? PEARL: Just leave him alone. Did you try to find anything about Diamond in the Rough online? You wouldn't find anything. If you look for anything about this scumbag's management company you wouldn't find anything. PEARL: [SOFTLY] What? ROSA: All you would have found is your tape up on a porn site. LUX: [SHOUTING] What the fuck do you want? What? ROSA: I'm sorry. I should have stopped him... but I needed proof. - I'm sorry. - LUX: Don't let her stop you! - Shut the fuck up, Mark! - LUX: You're too talented. Don't you ever call me that again. Fuck you. What do you want from me? I want you publicly humiliated. Which I will make sure you are. I've had cameras on you. Everyone, the world will know what you did. Now I'm watching you sweat. I'm watching you sweat, because I'm going to blow your fucking brains out! PEARL: Wait. I don't want him to die. It's too easy. I want him to suffer. I want him to pay. He won't pay. He'll get six months and off in three. Nothing changes. Everyone is talking about a rape culture. It's everywhere. Brock Turner, Polanski, Cosby. Everyone's talking. Everyone talks about a few scapegoats so they feel better. But nothing changes! He won't suffer. I'm done. - Do it. - Don't do it. ROSA: It's my choice. Right? Isn't that what you told me? Isn't that what you told us? I know. And you're a young lady that's full of emotion, and compassion, and a good sense of fairness. However, because of that innocence, this world would have eaten you up a thousand times. Without the proper guidance, you would be left with one or two options. You either quit the craft of acting where you become an evil distasteful person. There is no shame in how you auditioned. And like I mentioned to you before, the audition was not about qualifying you for selection, it was for this moment to reveal itself, and for the proper prescription to be applied. A great actress is a mistress of emotion and the environment around her. So, if there's any lesson to be learned here, it's that you need to control your emotions. Your lack of emotional control is human and normal. But in order to be able to portray the human conditions you must transcend beyond the human scope! Do it. Do it! LUX: There. That's it. Well done. [DOOR OPENS] [DOOR SHUTS] WAITRESS: Do you have a permit for that? Let me take that from you. We'll lock it up in the safe. I'll call the police. WOMAN 1: I can't believe this is happening. WOMAN 2: Are you okay? WOMAN 3: Oh, my God. WOMAN 1: Get your things. Let's get out of here. WOMAN 4: I thought we were going to die. WOMAN 1: Let's go. [ON TV] And now for a special report. After months of investigation, we have received insider footage of the most recent in a string of pornography scams. We were first contacted by Rosa Torano after she discovered that what she thought was a screen test had become a sex tape sold to porno sites across the world. She was able to follow her perpetrator, and tape him as he lured other young women into the scheme. Here is the footage of Mark Ambrozini from the Bronx. - I have something to tell you. - Using a pseudonym of Lux... - What? - I gave that reporter the tape. Your tape and mine. Sorry. Yours wasn't mine to send. I'll call her. I'll... I'll get it back. I'm so sorry. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS] WOMAN: And then he raped me. He raped me 14 times. And then he told me if I say that he's going to kill me. And then, I become pregnant. So, I told him, "I don't know, maybe..." [WOMEN SPEAKING OVER ONE ANOTHER] I decided that I would jerk him off rather than be totally raped, - because I didn't want that to be... - And I can't move. He pulled down my panties. - WOMAN: And I was alone... - ...jerked him off and tried to think of other... WOMAN: ...that I didn't feel very well. And I couldn't move. WOMAN: And I felt I've done something wrong. I know I didn't, but I still felt that. He put his erect dick up against the door, trapping me inside of it. - I'll never forget... - ...until she fell asleep. [WOMEN SPEAKING OVER ONE ANOTHER] [VOICES GET LOUDER] [VOICES STOPS] Just let 'em keep it. We're in this together now. [WOMEN CONTINUE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] [SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE] [PEARL SOBBING] [SISTERPLAYING]
