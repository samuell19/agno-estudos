(air whooshing) (metal clanging) (eerie electronic music) - Don't hide from me, 'cause I will always find you. You think you get away, but I'm in your head. (eerie music) I am 8 Ball the Clown. And I became a clown to entertain, to create laughter, and to make people happy. I was so filled with rage and the pain burned. Oh, how it burned in my brain eating at me, and feeding my addiction. I tried to make it go away to soothe the pain with a little opioid here and there. And so my addiction grew out of control, and I could no longer contain the rage. It would not stop, and so I spewed destruction. There have been a handful of dark times in my life. And these are by far the darkest. My emotions swirls, opioids run through my veins injecting whatever I can find to get my next fix. And it's never enough. Never enough, so I keep going deeper and deeper into the depths of hell, shattering the dreams and illusions of being the greatest clown ever. I kill for no reason other than pure euphoria, seeking to dull the painful demons in my brain, if just for a moment avoiding reality which is my failure. I used to be stable and quite entertaining. But over time, people became afraid of clowns. They feared clowns. And even despised clowns. For that, they will certainly pay. Oh they will pay dearly for the sinful acts that have been disposed on me. Laughing at me, not with me. They beg for their lives. They want mercy, and I take away their pain. China white, brown tie, Mexican crude, or synthetic bliss. That's all you need to know. Lately, I've been feeling unstable again. And my addiction has evolved into an insatiable lust for killing. And I don't just kill. I bring them to my god. Flowing through their veins in a precarious manner, bringing the pleasure, and euphoria, and the pain of certain death. I am 8-Ball the Clown. And I will make you happy. Oh yes. Oh yes. You will be happy. This I can assure you. (laughs) (eerie music) (water running) I don't know. What? Who are you? Who are you? I don't know. (slow suspenseful music) (inaudible) What the fuck? That didn't just happen. Oh god. This heroine must be cut with some dirty shit. This can't be real. Okay, okay, okay. Okay, regain composure. I gotta, I gotta go finish what I started. I gotta finish what I started. (slow suspenseful music) Oh god. This can't be fucking real. (crying) (slow suspenseful music) Jesus, stop. (slow suspenseful music) My magic hat. (laughs) (slow suspenseful music) (laughs) Back to paradise. Ah. Ah. Oh. (groaning) (slow suspenseful music) (knocking on door) Okay. Hello miss. What can I do for you? - I'm here about that baby stuff you listed on the internet. - Ah yes, the baby stuff. - It's a boy. - It does look like you got a little one on board, don't you. - Due any day now. - Yes, seems like he'll be coming out real soon. - Yeah, the ad said there was some, some toys and clothes. They said it was a crib and like some-- - Yeah, I got a baby seat too. I'm sorry, my manners. Come on in, please. Please, come in. Everything's just down there. - So what are you, like a clown or something? - Yeah. Yeah, I sure am. I mean the kids just love me. I actually have a surprise party planned for later tonight. (slow suspenseful music) - [Pregnant Woman] Well it sounds like your parties a lot of fun. - Oh, my parties are to die for. - Well maybe you can do my kid's birthday party. - Oh, I'd be delighted to. (screaming) Shh. (screaming) Shh. Shh shh shh. (slow suspenseful music) - Please watch your surroundings. Do not hesitate to call 911. All right. (inaudible) Please be precaution of these children. Pick them up from school. Make sure they know (inaudible) cause these clowns are everywhere. (inaudible) City has been overwhelmed with these clown sightings. We'll keep you updated on the Day nine o'clock news and (inaudible) This is Juanita Foster signing off. See ya. (slow suspenseful music) - Ambiance. Yes, yes. Here we go. Just. Got to put a little cover on your face. Make sure you're here for the party. (humming) Oh, so cute. (cackles) Yeah, just a little, just a little dab will do you. (humming) Yeah, I want you to look beautiful when you're having that kid. It's a very special event, after all. (laughs) Alright, thanks for holding that. Let's see. Right. (slow suspenseful music) (laughs) Oh no, that's too good. Alright, now we just got to figure how to get the baby out. I know there's something around here. (laughs) No, no. Fun but not delicate enough. I could, no, too blunt. Hmm, that's a thought. No, I need a more precise hand. Of course, trusty rusty. My old friend. You will do the job. (laughs) But not just yet. (screams) - No. Stop it. - What are you doing? - No. - What are you doing? - You are being very naughty. If you persist, I am going to cut your voice box. And then you're not gonna make any more noises, okay. - What do you want from me? What do you want? - [8 Ball] To be happy, just like everybody else. - Don't do this. - I think I deserve it. (laughs) Oh, oh, my. - No, no. - I want your baby. - No. (laughs) Don't. - Don't worry, don't worry. - No. - Your baby's gonna be fine. (laughs) I've done this many times before. - Let me go. - No, no, no, no, no. (screams) Why don't you go to sleep, okay. - [Pregnant Woman] No. No. - Let me get you something for your pain. - [Pregnant Woman] Please no. No. No. - Shh. Sleep tight. Sleep tight. (laughs) We've got a lot of work to do. (laughs) (slow suspenseful music) (baby crying) (laughs) Little buddy. (baby crying) (laughs) Hey. Hey, welcome. Buddy. (laughs) This is your world now. (laughs) It's a boy. It's a boy. (baby crying) (laughs) Say bye to mommy. She's not gonna make it. (laughs) (baby crying) (laughs) I love you. Welcome to the world, little guy. It's gonna be a lifetime of laughter and love, and heroine. (laughs) But every baby boy needs juice, right. Mother's milk to make us big and strong. Oh, welcome, welcome. All of this will be yours. You will be the greatest clown ever. (baby crying) (laughs) Oh, the games we'll play. (laughs) It'll be a party every day. (laughs) I always knew I'd be a good dad. I don't care what they say. (slow suspenseful music) It's not true what they say. Clowns never eat their young. (laughs) (baby crying) Welcome to the world, little guy. It'll be what you make it. (slow suspenseful music) I bet you're hungry too. Don't worry, I'll get you something real soon. (humming) (slow suspenseful music) (baby crying) (laughs) Oh, I know what you need. (slow suspenseful music) The first step in a journey of a thousand miles. (laughs) There you go. (laughs) Sleep tight little baby. (laughs) (slow suspenseful music) It's okay. Shh. Everything's gonna be fine now. (slow suspenseful music) Don't worry drama. I know what you need. I know what you need. (slow suspenseful music) (baby crying) (slow suspenseful music) - My god. Holy fuck, you scared the shit out of me you fucking asshole. God. (slow suspenseful music) (slow suspenseful music) (muffled laughing) Man, you look like hell. - You'd look like hell too if you were a clown. Nobody likes clowns anymore. But dammit, the world needs us. (laughs) - I don't know what's so bad about clowns. I mean you're right, everyone needs clowns. - Everyone needs to laugh. (laughs) - Man, look at you. - I don't want to. - Jesus. - Look at you. - Yeah. - You're drunk. (laughs) - Judge my drinking. - Oh, I'm not judging, I need a ride. (laughs) - You don't know why I drink, okay. I drink because I got a lot of pain. - You think you have pain, try being a clown. (slow suspenseful music) - I'm not even supposed to be here today. - Maybe if you didn't drink, you'd still have your kids. (laughs) - I don't know why we fight so much. - Have you ever tried being a clown? She might like that. - Never. Never been a clown before. - You got to bring a little spice to the bedroom. - You're right. That's a good idea. I might try that. How much do one of those cost? - I'll do it for free. (laughs) It's not like it'll make things worse. (laughs) (slow suspenseful music) All right, Balloon, show me the hairy. - I got little something more than brown stone. - Oh yeah? - I got some shit that's gonna fuck you up. This is what they call blue lady. - Blue lady? - Yeah. - What the fuck? I hope it's not like that last batch man. That shit had me fucking walking like a zombie. I woke up, I woke up in a crypt. Okay. - [Balloon] Yes, some new shit man. All the kids doing it. - Well if it's good for kids, it's good for clowns. (laughs) - It's like a little bit of Mr. Brownstone mixed with some meth. You can light it, snort it, smoke it, or shoot it. - Let's do it all. (laughs) - Yeah. Come on. Shit, let's fire some up man. - Okay. - Let's go old school. Yeah man. Let's do it. - Just plop some there. (slow suspenseful music) (laughs) We're gonna get fucked up. - Right. - I'm looking forward to this. Okay, okay, okay. This one's a little tricky. Why don't you light it up for us. - Gotcha man. (laughs) Yeah man, this is gonna be great. I'm telling you man, this is the best. (slow suspenseful music) (coughing) - Holy fuck. (coughing) Fuck. (slow suspenseful music) - Oh shit. - God fuck. Oh. - Isn't that some good shit, bro? - Fuck. Oh. Yeah. - How you gonna pay up man? I ain't no fucking charity. - Man, you know I don't have any money. - What? What do you mean you don't have any money, man? - I don't, I'm a fucking clown. - So? - I don't make any money. - What about your last victim, man, that you killed? Did you take his fucking wallet? - It's gone. - What do you mean it's gone? - I got nothing. - What the fuck does that men? - Nothing but trusty rusty. - Dude, what the fuck am I supposed to do with all this shit? - I, I, I don't know. - Get the fuck out of here, man. You fucking suck as a clown, man. - [8 Ball] The fuck did you say? - Fuck you, you fucking wannabe washed up piece of shit. - Bullshit. - [Balloon] Go back to the circus or something, you fucking big motherfucker. - Okay. Okay. Fuck. - Go make some fucking money, man. - Oh, how about I try, how about I try to steal from Balloon. (soft music) 8 Ball bitch. (laughs) You, yes, yes, yes, of course. Always come prepared. Hmm. You almost look the part. (slow suspenseful music) Almost. Tricky. Perfect. (laughs) (humming) Yes. The festive clown. - [8 Ball] So send me a message, and I'll call you right back. - You need to hear this. It's funny as hell. - [Child] What is it? - Wiggles the Clown. His answering machine message. - [8 Ball] Hey, you've reached 8 Ball the Clown. I'm out making children happy. (laughs) So twerk me a message and I'll call you right back. - He's stupid. (playful music) (screaming) You need to stop luring kids into the woods, you creep. - [8 Ball] Hey, you've reached 8 Ball the Clown. I'm out making children happy. (laughs) So twerk me a message and I'll call you right back. Fucking kids. - Clowns suck. (yelling) Drunk looser. (farthing) Ewe. - [8 Ball] Hey, it's 8 Ball the Clown. I'm out making children happy. (laughs) - You ruin birthday parties just because you're a drunk looser. (playful music) - You're a sick, demented asshole. - You're a horrible clown. - Yeah, I bet you live in the dumpster. - No, he probably lives in the sewer. (laughs) - True. (knocking on door) - Hold on. (knocking) - Alright. Alright man, please stop banging on my door. I got a baby sleeping. I'm not trying to buy nothing. - Man, I ain't selling anything. I'm not selling nothing. I'm just looking for my wife. - I don't-- - Where my wife at? - I don't get many visitors here man. - I haven't seen her man. My wife's car sitting in front of your house. - I haven't seen any strange ladies hanging around. - [Husband] Have you seen her? - [8 Ball] Well maybe she had the baby. - [Husband] I don't-- - [8 Ball] Have you checked the hospitals? - What you mean about a baby? - [8 Ball] You just said she's pregnant. - Man, the car's sitting right there. - Okay, please feel free to look around. You're not gonna find her here. (baby crying) (slow suspenseful music) (baby crying) (laughs) Meet baby daddy. Hello. (laughs) Well, he was, he would have been, but. (laughs) Well, looks like baby's daddy is gonna be joining a momma for a night of fun and excitement. Yes. Yes. It's gonna be a great time. (laughs) Come on, drama. We've got some party favors to put together. (laughs) No, no, stay there. (news playing) - This is Steve Yeager with WD5 TV and we're talking with Erica Collins, a 13 year old (inaudible) student who was recently attacked by a clown. Erica, could you tell us what happened? - Well, I was walking my dog by the reservoir. And she slipped off her leash and took off running. Well of course I went after her. - Well that's understandable. So what happened next? (slow suspenseful music) - Well I was looking around for her when someone came up and grabbed me from behind. I tried to, I tried to scream, but he put his hand over my mouth. (inaudible) - That had to be terrifying. What was going through your mind? - I'm dead. He's going to kill me. And he whispered the creepiest thing to me. - And what was that? (inaudible) - That's horrible. But you got away. How'd you do that? (inaudible) - She's small but she attacked. And when I looked behind me, he was gone. - Wow, were you able to give the police a good description? - [Erica] For sure. (inaudible) - [Steve] Well thank you for sharing your terrible experience with us. - What are you doing? - Pranking the clown. - What clown? - Wiggles. His message is funny. - His message might be funny, but stop. - All the kids do it. - Have you seen whats on the news? All the stuff about the clowns? I really wouldn't be pranking that clown right now. - We were just having fun. - At his expense? Just leave him alone. He's probably gonna come over here all pissed off. - Why? - Hang it up and stop. Why would you fuck around with a clown? He could find out where you live. School's been canceled tomorrow. - [Girl] Yay. - School is boring. - Yeah, but it's not that much of yay. It's canceled cause of the clown sightings. - Can we stay up late? - Not real late. You can stay up until I get home. - Sure. - Oh yeah, and mom will be back tomorrow, so you guys need to clean this stuff up. - Alright, I got it. Just go. - Should be back around 11 or so. So don't answer the door. Call me if you need anything. And watch out for the clowns. (laughs) - That's not fucking funny. - Nice language. - [Boy] Thank you. (slow suspenseful music) - [Woman] Help. (slow suspenseful music) (moaning) - Oh you dirty girl. You've thrown up all over yourself. Clowns know how to hold their juices. (laughs) How you doing, honey? (crying) You're looking a little rough. (laughs) Why aren't you happy? You look like you should be. You know, god told me I need to make as many people happy as I can. So, I'm just doing what I got to. (laughs) What's that? You got something to say? (laughs) Don't hold back. (laughs) There's no judgment here. (laughs) You're in my happy place, so you should learn to be happy. (laughs) You know I got these balloons special for you. (crying) What's that? (laughs) Oh, I kill myself. I kill everyone. (laughs) - Don't. - Heroine is like inhaling the breath of God. There is nothing more euphoric than sticking a needle in my arm. The slow penetration, as the warmth of a her orgasm slowly moves through my body, mixing with the blood in a macabre dance of utterly fascinating fantasy. (laughs) Oh, the pure, white liquid lady heroine as she pulls me deep inside her, suckling me. Oh, I will humiliate you. I will manipulate you. I will lie to you. I will defile you. I will cut you. I will kill you. Because heroine, heroine is my god. And my faith is strong. (laughs) Now you, now you will get to feel the pure pleasure and pain of my god. (crying) (slow suspenseful music) What's wrong with you? What? Hey, buddy. Buddy. Oh shit. Shit. Hello. Oh no. Oh god. Who's gonna play with me now. Oh god, mom. Mom's gone. Oh god, I got to move the body. I gotta clean this up. I gotta, I gotta do something. Oh god. Okay, okay. Not expected, not expected. Will this help? Something better. Something bigger to clean this up. I don't know. Oh god, mom can't see this. Fuck. That's okay. Maintain positive attitude. (slow suspenseful music) Oh shit. Momma's not gonna like this, but I got a plan. It's okay. We'll make you smaller. Fuck that. You ready? (laughs) (slow suspenseful music) (saw rumbling) (phone ringing) (slow suspenseful music) - [8 Ball] Hey, you've reached 8 Ball the Clown. I'm out making children happy. (laughs) So twerk me a message, and I'll call you right back. Fucking kids. (playful music) - [Kid] Stupid, ain't it.

(phone ringing) (crying) (slow suspenseful music) - Huh, I found my old bobble head. This things fun. (slow suspenseful music) Kristine, turn the light back on. It's not funny. (slow suspenseful music) Kristine, turn the light back on. It's not funny. (slow suspenseful music) Kristine, open the door. Open the door, it's not funny. Kristine. - Beautiful. (laughs) (screams) Kristine, open the door. (laughs) Kristine, open the door. - [Kristine] Why the fuck did you do that? - There's a clown in the garage. - [Kristine] There's no clown. (slow suspenseful music) - It just takes a little time. I'll find you little fuckers. Oh, I'll find you. (laughs) Yeah. And then we'll play. (slow suspenseful music) Then we'll play. (slow suspenseful music) Fuckers, you fuckers think you're funny? Oh, we'll see who's funny. We're gonna get together. You and your fucking sister. The two of you, you'll be my new playmates.

Well fuck you, cause I got the last laugh. (laughs) Yeah. (slow suspenseful music) (knocking on door) (slow suspenseful music) - Let's eat. (slow suspenseful music) (speaking foreign language) (slow suspenseful music) (doorbell rings) (muffled music) (doorbell rings) (knocking on door) (slow suspenseful music) (screams) (slow suspenseful music) (indistinct radio chatter) - [Radio Host] In Baltimore. The first time I heard anything about this, was in the morning show talking about clowns, Brooklyn Berney, freaking people out. Man, has this gained momentum, especially with Halloween coming up. This is crazy. Brian, what can you tell us about these clowns popping up all over the country? - [Brian] Nobody really knows what's going on? Are these hoaxes? Are they real threats? We really don't know. But what we do know is that it made it to the White House. It's really become a hot topic. The White House press secretary was asked about all these clown sightings nationwide, and who would have thought this. You know, clowns, the topic of clowns would make it to the White House and become part of an official press release. - [Radio Host] Yeah. You know, it's kind of ironic going from talk of all the clowns in the Senate and Congress to this. Are they related? - [Brian] That's a good one, Jackson. Clowns, talking about clowns, press secretary taken from the White House and is looking at this seriously. And the president has been briefed on the situation. While they're not taking any immediate action, they have communicated out to state officials to be vigilant. And in a statement to the press, they urged people to take this seriously and not to prank or try to scare someone. - [Jackson] Man. I can't believe the president is talking about this. - [Brian] You got that right. Let the police departments deal with them. These reports though coming in all across the country. Kentucky today reported that six schools shut down because of potential clown threats. North Carolina's had them too. Florida has them. Washington has them. Oregon has them. And in Indiana, a man dressed as a clown was shot just outside of a shopping center. No report on his condition. - [Jackson] So it's not even safe being a clown. You might get shot. Clowns always freak me out. I got a little fear of clowns, but this thing keeps growing. I mean, what kind of effect does that have on the legitimate clowns? - [Brian] Certainly, that's got legitimate clowns nervous. And they're asking people to remain calm. Don't panic. And most of all, don't shoot unless your life is in danger. Yeah, if you got a job as a clown, you probably don't want to commute wearing all your makeup and a wig. You probably don't want to walk around in public. So maybe you don't get ready until you're at the event. Then you are probably gonna clean up before you leave. - [Jackson] That'll put a hurting on their business, I bet. - [Brian] Sure. But they seem to be remaining positive. The Baltimore police have taken to social media saying you can't just go shooting clowns. If you see a clown, don't shoot it unless the clown's breaking-- (honking) - Jesus Christ. - [Brian] You just can't go shoot a clown unless your life's in danger. In surrounding counties, many schools remain closed. And those that are open have an active police presence. I mean this is really getting serious. In Annapolis, several high school kids were arrested for making (inaudible) near a school, which caused panic earlier in the week. So not all this is real. A lot of it might just be hoaxes. And kids, if you're hearing this right now, listen to me. It's not a good time to do that. You might think it's funny, but you might get arrested, or worse you might end up in the morgue. - [Jackson] So before you go out dressed as a clown, you might take some precautions. Sure. But what about the pranksters? You know, people (inaudible) - [Driver] What the fuck? - [Brian] Well, as long as you're not out attacking people, breaking into houses, I mean. (slow suspenseful music) - I'm making like some like, it's called family hello, but if you have a certain name, like it's, it says, it like alert some message. (slow suspenseful music) (honking) (slow suspenseful music) (laughs) - Get well soon, motherfucker. (laughs) You look so happy. (laughs) And you look as happy as when you died. (laughs) Very nice. Let's get some more color in there. Yes. (laughs) Yes. To make sure nobody can mistake you for an unhappy man. I wish your mommy could see you now. She'd be so happy. That's pretty good. (laughs) Let's make sure we know. (laughs) You look good. (laughs) You look happy. Everyone should be happy. (laughs) (slow suspenseful music) - [Brian] Got this thing over. Got it. It's a crazy moment. Listen kids, (inaudible). It's a big thing. Most of it's probably imagination. Hoaxes, just the though. (inaudible) So far-- - Squishy. (laughs) (humming) - [Jackson] We'll have to keep an eye on this one. (inaudible) - [Brian] Take it easy and have a good night. - [Jackson] Clowns. This is Jackson on Rock 108. (slow suspenseful music) Food. (slow suspenseful music) (inaudible) Yes. Shh. (laughs quietly) (news playing in background) (slow suspenseful music) No shit, doc. Where the fuck is my hat? (laughs) (slow suspenseful music) Fear of clowns. (laughs) I fucking hate the phone. (laughs) - [Man] Where the fuck is Benny, bitch? (slow suspenseful music) (screams) (slow suspenseful music) (leaves rustling) (knocking on window) (screams) (slow suspenseful music) (screams) - Alex, what the hell? That was you, wasn't it Alex? Why are you always trying to scare me? That was you, that was the clown wasn't it? - I wasn't outside. - It was you. Get out of here. (slow suspenseful music) (ringing) - So you were the one calling me, so I figured I'd call you back. (laughs) Hey, how's it going? Whatcha up to? - What do you want from us? - I want to see you laugh. I want to see you laugh, and laugh, and laugh. (laughs) I want to make you have fun. - What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? - You had plenty to say on my answering machine, didn't you? You and your little fucking brother. - We were just pranking you. - I'm just returning the call. You got a birthday coming up soon? - I'm gonna call the cops on you. - Oh yeah? And what are they gonna do? Huh? Tell me. Are they gonna protect you from little ole me? (laughs) - [Kristine] Just leave us alone. - Oh, I want to. But there's some games we have to play first. - [Kristine] What games? - Oh you know, just stuff to make you feel like you're laughing. I'd like to introduce you to religion. - [Kristine] What do you want from us? - I want to see you laugh. I want to see you laugh, and laugh, and laugh. (laughs) I want to make you have fun until it hurts. (laughs) How's your papa? - My dad's gonna kill you. - Bet he's feeling a little run down. (laughs) One too many shots. (laughs) Is your brother around, perhaps? - Just leave us alone. - Cause you're both just earned yourself a play date with 8 Ball. (laughs) And I love to play. - That's precisely why we hate clowns. (laughs) Are you in our house? (slow suspenseful music) - Jesus Christ. Why did you do that? - That was payback for what you and your stupid friends did to try and prank me with that dumb clown. - I didn't do that. - Yeah, you did. How else did you get my number? (slow suspenseful music) - [8 Ball] 911, what's your emergency? - It's a clown. There's a clown. - [8 Ball] Calm down. - The clown's going to kill us. - [8 Ball] Where is this clown? - Outside behind our house. - [8 Ball] Is it a man? - It's a fucking clown. - [8 Ball] I think we have another clown hoax. - It's not a hoax. It's a clown. - [8 Ball] Can you describe it? - What, it's a fucking clown. I goddamn clown. What is there to describe? - [8 Ball] Miss, calm down. Did you see any weapons? - No. - [8 Ball] Did he threaten you? - He said some creepy poem. Send the police. - [8 Ball] Are you in a safe location? - Sort of. I locked the door. - [8 Ball] Are your parents home? - No. - [8 Ball] Well is there anyone else in the house? - My brother. - [8 Ball] Where's he hiding? - I don't know. - [8 Ball] Tell me where the fuck he's hiding. - Who is this? - Where the fuck is he hiding? - I don't know. - Have you looked in the mirror? (laughs) (slow suspenseful music) Every one of us can say we knew someone who lived with the pain. Those who survived within the shadows of their terrorizers gains. The flames his lips that whisper words of easy passage. While they savage garden after garden until the all of things are ravaged. There were far too many, maybe even more than I knew that felt the pain. Yet I'm insane. I know that this is true. You run and hide so far to get away from the pain. But still I know the knife I left is deeply cutting inside your brain. Now, I have to go find your little brother and fix him up. (honking) (slow suspenseful music) (honking) (slow suspenseful music) One, two. I'm coming for you. (laughs) Three, four, you better hide for sure. Five, six, it's an evil trick. Seven, eight, I'm full of hate. Nine, 10. (laughs) I'm your worst nightmare. (honking) (slow suspenseful music) Where you hiding at you little fucker? Where you hiding you little fucker?

(laughs) (slow suspenseful music) (laughs) (slow music) (laughs) (slow suspenseful music) (laughs) (slow suspenseful music) (slow suspenseful music) Yeah. Yeah. (slow suspenseful music) You're not working with me. (laughs) Oh yes, perfect. Very patriotic. (laughs) Perfect. (humming) (eerie music) (laughs) (eerie music) (inaudible) This is my faith. This is my god. The desire overwhelms me. Here, look at me. (laughs) Mom always said share, and here I'm supping up the nectar of gods and not even sharing with myself. Okay, okay. Oh. The warmth. Oh the sweet warmth. Why can't I stop. (eerie music) Euphoria. The twisted wrinkles in time. Oh god. It feels so much closer. (laughs) Okay, okay. There's a little bit left that I can share with you. (laughs) You're gonna get a little taste, a little taste of holy fire, a little taste of Christ. (laughs) (eerie music) Oh, it's so pretty, the crimson. I know you want to taste my god. My god wants to own your soul. (laughs) Wants to end your life. (laughs) Don't worry you little fuck, I got more. I got more and we're gonna enjoy this journey together. (laughs) (eerie music) I know you will taste my god. My god wants to taste you. My god wants to own you. My god wants to own your soul, boy. (laughs) So here comes a taste of mother's milk. (eerie music) (laughs) (eerie music) - Alex? - Have faith, you little fuck. I have more. And you're gonna taste my god. You're gonna worship my god. You will bow to him. (laughs) You are gonna die by my god. (laughs) - It's you who's gonna die. - The fuck you say? (eerie music) We'll see kid. The party's just begun. (slow suspenseful music) - Alex? (slow suspenseful music) What the fuck is going on? (slow suspenseful music) This prank has gone on too far. I'm shooting his ass. (horn honking) (laughs) - Come here. (screams) (slow suspenseful music) Hey little girl. Your brother, oh your brother is such a piece of work. He thought he could hide from me. But he could never hide from me cause I will always find you. You think you get away, but I'm in your head. Now, now your brother's escaping himself. Oh, his mind is floating around on a little journey as his skin tangles, and his blood burns. (laughs) He's headed on a trip he will not soon forget. A journey through the depths of hell. It will bring him to his end. (laughs) But you, little girl, you just couldn't stop, could you? You had to push my buttons. You just kept calling, and calling, and calling, and calling, and calling. And I tried to stop it myself. I did. I thought I could maybe just end it. But I couldn't even do that, no. But the fucking anger burned in me so bright I thought I know how I can end the torment. I could hunt you down one by one and finish this little game. (laughs) Yes, yes I figured out a way. (laughs) (slow suspenseful music) Ambiance. (slow suspenseful music) You thought this was for you? Oh no, too much air. Yes. This, this one's for me. (laughs) (slow suspenseful music) Oh. (slow suspenseful music) (laughs) Now we're ready. This will be nice. (slow suspenseful music) Perfect. So pretty. (slow suspenseful music) Something bright. (slow suspenseful music) Yeah. (slow suspenseful music) Good enough. (slow suspenseful music) You're gonna die beautiful. (laughs) - No. You're gonna die. - What? - You think your heroine is a god? (slow suspenseful music) (laughs) - Right here. (laughs) Right here, right here, go ahead. (laughs) You shouldn't play with guns. You know, you're really annoying. I should have killed you earlier. But no, you're sister wanted to play first. Right here. Come on, no go ahead. Right here, right here. (slow suspenseful music) (laughs) Stupid little boy. You got to put bullets in it. (laughs) - I know that. I only put in one bullet. - Well how about right here? Why if you want to take me out, well just shoot me in my heart. Right in my heart, boy. (laughs) (gun shot fires) (slow suspenseful music) (moaning) - [Alex] Do you feel lucky? (moaning) (slow suspenseful music) (gun shot fires) Look at you dying. - [Kristine] Death is not a laughing matter. (slow suspenseful music) - [Operator] 911, what's your emergency? - There's a clown that tried to kill us. (moaning) - [Operator] Alright, calm down. Where are you at? - [Alex] We're in our house. - [Operator] Well where's the clown? - In our computer room. We shot him. - [Operator] Okay. You shot him? What happened? - I'm gonna get those little fuckers. - He tried to kill us, and my brother shot him. - [Operator] Is he still moving? - No. A little, but I think he's dead. - I can't believe that little fucker shot me. - [Operator] Why would your brother shoot the clown? - He was trying to kill us. - [Operator] You probably deserved it. - [Kristine] What? Send the police. - [Operator] Are you sure he's dead? - He should be. He stopped laughing. - [Operator] Are you now in a safe location? - [Kristine] Yes. (screams) - It is actually pretty funny when it's someone else. And now it's your turn. (laughs) I bet you'd like to scream. I bet you think it's so funny. Well it's kind of hard, isn't it? Feeling a little weak? (laughs) Hey, hey little buddy. I can't believe a little maggot like you shot me. (laughs) You know what, death is not a laughing matter, huh. Well, I say it is, especially when it's happening to someone else. And I guess it's your turn isn't it, sunny boy. (laughs) Feeling pretty funny now, aren't you? Well why don't you scream? Why don't you yell out for help? (laughs) Oh that's right, you can't, cause I thought a little blood letting might help you out of your delusional fantasies. You want to play games with a clown? Be prepared, (laughs) cause I always laugh last. (laughs) See you later buddy. (laughs) (eerie music) (horn honking) - What a nightmare. Alex. - [Alex] What? (slow suspenseful music) - Whoa that was a nightmare. I hate clowns. (slow suspenseful music) Alex? (screams) - What a nightmare. Alex? (eerie music) (laughs) - Mother's milk. We all know how this is gonna end. (laughs) (eerie music) A job well done.
