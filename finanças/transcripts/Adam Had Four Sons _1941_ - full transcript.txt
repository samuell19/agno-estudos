One... two... three... Ah-choo. Are you all right, son? That had to happen. When you have to sneeze, you have to sneeze. We haven't much time. We have to pick up the new governess. We have plenty of time, Adam. Darling, no. Who cares about our new governess, anyway? Shh. Phillip. Does anybody else want to sneeze? No. Does anybody want to cough? No. Does anybody want to do anything? No. Whenever you're ready, Miss Bunson. Now smile. Everybody smile. One, two, three. Wow. Well, that's over. Last one out in the car is a doodle! Hey... I'll get the car quick. I'll drive as far as Chicago. No, no. Philadelphia. You said Philadelphia. I'll drive from Philadelphia to Chicago. I'll drive from Chicago to New Orleans. All right, then I'll drive us from New Orleans to California Everybody ready? I wanna drive! Oh, sit down. You're too little. Be quiet. I'm not too little. Hey, Trenton, Trenton! Philadelphia, Philadelphia. Hey, get out of the way down there! Who do you think you are? Get out of the way! It's my turn now. It's not your turn. I'm driving this gas buggy. Get out of here. I'll-- Hey, hey, hey. Now, what are you doing? Phillip, get away from that wheel. Where do you think you're going, boys? We're on our way to California, Dad. Right now we're in Philadelphia. Well, suppose you come back to Connecticut. Look here, Jack. You didn't touch those gears, did you? Oh, no. All right. Come on. Hurry up. Get out, get out, so your mother can get in. You boys didn't get mussed up, did you? No. No, mother. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Here. Let me help you. Take your time. That's all right. Thank you, darling. Thank you, Phillip. You hold my hat, dear. Yes, dear. Now, look here, boys. Remember I-- I don't want any trouble today, you understand? Yes, Dad. All right. Otto? Commence cranking. Dad, when are we going to get a new 1907 model? Now this is a better automobile than the new 1907. I doubt if they'll ever improve it. Listen to that engine, huh? Sounds fine. Well, here we go. Maybe we should've met her at the boat. But, darling, she speaks English, and she wired she was on the train. This can't be she, can it? She's so young. Mrs. Stoddard? Why, yes? I'm Emilie Gallatin. Well, my dear, pardon this, but we didn't expect a girl so young. And so very pretty. Oh, madame. This is Mr. Stoddard. How do you do? How do you do, monsieur? Well, here are the boys. Boys, this is your new governess. Four boys. How nice. This is Jack. He's our eldest. Jack. And this is Christopher. Christopher. And David. David. And here's our baby. This is Phillip. How do you do, Phillip? Say "How do you do?" Phillip. Well, now, here, Phil, what is this? Temperament in the family? I can see Phillip will be a man of character. He's cautious about making friends. Thank you, Otto. Daddy, we had a wonderful ride. That's good, son. Yes, our daddy is the best driver in the world. We're going to get a new 1907 model. This is Otto. Mademoiselle Emilie. Welcome, mademoiselle. Well, I knew you would meet us. Uh, pardon, mademoiselle? I mean, I-- I knew it would look like this. Everything just-- just... like this. Otto, Otto, bring the bags in, will you? Come on. Come on, everyone. Let's go inside. Welcome to the Stoddard domicile. Well, thank you, monsieur. Come on, boys. Oh, how lovely. Did you, uh, did you know the hall was here? Yes, monsieur. Well, perhaps you can show us where the parlor is. Oh, Adam, darling. This is wonderful... That's wonderful. Isn't mademoiselle wonderful? Now, where's the dining room? That's marvelous. Where's your room? Shall I show it to you? Yes, go ahead. Don't show her, don't show her! We won't. There it is. That's right, that's right. Come on. I'll show you the playroom. Yes. Watch. I hold the record. Seven times. Oh, seven? I can go four. One, two, three-- Oh, no, no, no. You're climbing. One more. Oh. Oh, four and a half. Well, they are fine, strong boys. Well, just look at their father. Oh, darling. He was a very great football player. Oh, football? Oh, that's an American game, isn't it? Oh, yes. Oh, he was wonderful. Come on. I'll show you how to chin yourself. Oh, like this? Hold that. One... two... three... four... five... Isn't she wonderful? She is. She knows how to handle children. Eight and nine. Look, I lost a tooth, and I got another one that's loose. Oh, that's... All right, now. Let mademoiselle go. Mother, do we have to call her mademoiselle? She's not very old, and if she's going to be with us a long time, couldn't we just call her Emilie? Oh, please. Perhaps it would be just as well. But Emilie and I have some things to talk about. You boys, go on outside. This door leads to your room too, Emilie. Oh, that's nice. Worse by the minute, sir. They just sold Chapman out. Now, we don't look so strong ourselves. It won't be a very happy Thanksgiving, sir. Well, there's one thing, Horace, I can always depend on your unfailing pessimism. Oh, I'm sorry, sir, to be so gloomy, but after all these years-- Oh, that's all right, Horace. Don't change. But there's one thing you should always remember-- if the country's sound, business is sound, and we've built our country on some pretty solid bedrock. Are you leaving now, sir? There's nothing wrong with me that my family won't cure. Well, happy Thanksgiving, Horace. That's it. Have I grown much, Emilie? Oh, if you keep on growing the way you have the last six months, you will land in the circus. Oh, this boat is broken again. I wonder who did that. Me. I did it, Emilie. All right, Phillip. We won't say anything more about it. And you and I will get some glue and we'll fix it. Emilie, you're not ever going to leave us, are you? Oh, no, Phillip. Why do you say that? I think you're wonderful. All of us say so. Mother and Dad too. But I love you most of all. Don't worry, Phillip. I'll stay as long as you want me to. You promise? I promise. Cross your heart and hope to die? Cross my heart and hope to die. Do this. Your turn. Oh, it's-- Why do I always beat you? No, no, don't worry, boys. You're both doing beautifully. Let me try it. Oh, no. You're too small. Besides, it's Emilie's turn. No, no. You'll never win any games like that, Emilie. Come on, boys. Now you try. Oh, no. No. Just one turn. Well, all right, I'll try. Oh, what a beauty. It went right through. It did, didn't it, heh? Where'd you learn to do that, Dad? How many times do I have to remind you boys that your father was once a very great college athlete? Is it hard, Dad? It's practice, my boy. Keep at it day in and day out. Come on. You got it. I got it. I got it. Come on. Here. Where's Mrs. Stoddard? Oh, she's lying down. Oh. What's the matter? Oh, nothing, monsieur. She always lies down this time of day. She does? Yes, monsieur. I didn't know that. Emilie, Emilie! Yes, boys. I'm coming. Oh, hello. Hello, darling. You're home early. Yes. A little. Darling, was it dreadful? I've been hearing the rumors all day. I've been worried about you. Well, it seemed pretty bad, but somehow it doesn't now. What's this I hear about your lying down in the afternoons? Oh, I don't often. Just when there's nothing else to do. And what's this? Absolutely nothing. Just a mild sedative. Don't be so curious. Besides, what do you mean by coming home before you're supposed to? You know, this is my domain until 5:30. Sure you're going to be all right tomorrow for the Thanksgiving dinner? I'm not only going to be all right for tomorrow, but I'm getting up right now. You can take the boys and me for a ride. Gonna be all right? Miss Emilie gets the first piece of plum pudding. She's our guest of honor today. Emilie, it must be quite an event-- your first Thanksgiving. Yes, monsieur, it is. Don't they have Thanksgiving where you come from, Emilie? Not that I know of. But perhaps they haven't so much to be thankful for. Don't you like living in America, Emilie? Yes, very much so. I think it's a great privilege. Dad, aren't you going to tell us the story about the family? On Thanksgiving, Dad always tells us the story about the Stoddards and how good we are. Dad's family helped start this country. Did Cousin Phillipa help start the country? Well, not quite, but she didn't miss it by far. She's almost 70 now, you know. Cousin Phillipa drinks too much gin. Chris. She does. She smokes cigars too, and she's this big across. Don't let them fool you, Emilie. She's a grand old lady. I wish she could've been with us today. It's the first time she's ever missed it. And you shouldn't forget she's our only living relative. Now, the time has come. Emilie, this is the cup of the Stoddards. Their history is bound up in it. Our ancestors have held this cup in their hands through all the Thanksgivings of yesterday. To the Stoddards. To the Stoddards. To the Stoddards. What is it, madame? Nothing. I'm just-- very-- happy. Madame. Mother. Jack, Jack, get Dr. Lane. How is she? Where can we talk? Right here. Tell me how-- how is she? Well, Adam, it's an operation-- right away. An operation? Now, now, now, now, now. This is no time for nerves. She never complained of anything. Why, you know her. It might've worried you. Now, with your permission, I want to call in Denton-- best surgeon in the city. I, uh, I don't think he'd want to move her. We'll fix up a room here. I'll take care of everything myself. Can I see her now? No, no, no, no, no, no. She's asleep. You can see her before the operation. Doctor? Yes? She's gonna be all right? Tell me the truth. Adam, 50-50. I wish I could be more encouraging. You all right, Molly? Tell him almost. Just a minute, monsieur. Can I see? Oh, very good. Thank you, dear. Now the ribbon. And Emilie-- Yes, madame? If anything happens to me-- the boys-- if I should be very ill-- I won't listen to anything like that, madame. Emilie, I trust you. Thank you, madame. Now let them in. Ah... My army. They're up pretty late, it seems to me. They just came to tell you good night, dear. Now don't forget to brush your teeth and tomorrow I'll treat you all to an ice cream. Well, I'd better give you a quarter now. I won't be up that soon. I won't be up that soon. I won't be up that soon. I won't be up that soon. Oh, dear--only three cents. All my worldly goods. Phillip, I thee endow. But you'll need it, Mother, when you get well. You can bring it to me then. Kiss me now. Good night, Mother. Night, Mother. Good night, David. Come on, boys. It's time to go to bed. Good night, my boys. Nice boys you have, Mr. Stoddard. We'll have to watch Jack a little-- just a little. He-- he's a bit too good-looking. Is he? Just a little. We'll watch him. And the others-- we mustn't give them everything they ask for. Molly? Yes, dear? Do it for us? Yes, dear. Molly, do it for me. Yes, dear. So this is what it means to be alone. I'm trying to imagine my life without her, but I can't. It will never be the same, of course, but it will be filled, I assure you. You have a legacy. She left it to you. A legacy-- my sons. They will be your life now, monsieur. You're spilling your coffee, Dad. Thanks, Chris. Dad, will you turn to the sports page and read us about those hockey matches? I wanna hear about basketball. Are you finished now, boys? Yes, Emilie. All right. Get your hats and coats. And don't forget your rubbers, Phillip. Today is the day for our allowance, Dad. What's the matter with Dad? Well, he's very busy these days. Isn't he going to give us our allowance? Oh, he'll give it to you tomorrow. Oh, why can't we get it now? Oh, now, no more questions. Hurry up. Get your things. Did you call up Cameron at First National? No, no, no. No, don't do anything until I get there, Horace. I'll be right in. I'm leaving immediately. Are things that bad, monsieur? Yes. They're very bad. Oh, I'm sorry. I hope it goes better today. Good luck, monsieur. Thank you, Emilie. Good evening. Horace told me. I'm terribly sorry. How are the boys? Oh, they are fine, monsieur. I'm expecting Cousin Phillipa any minute. Yes. She's waiting for you in the living room. Is there anything I can do for you? I had the cook keep your dinner. No. Nothing to eat, but I would like a drink. Yes. It's all set out for you in the living room. Good evening, Phillipa. Good evening, Adam. How'd it go today, hmm? What are your plans? I don't have much choice, Phillipa. That makes it easier. I've got to sell this house. Trouble is, I don't know what to do with the boys. I've got enough to send them to school. Phillip is too young. I know a flat for you in Brooklyn. You can live there with him. My greatest problem is Emilie. Send her home on the next boat. Why, I can't do that. She's been a part of this family. I can't dismiss her like that. But you've no choice, Adam. You said so yourself. Good morning, Emilie. I'd like to talk to you for a moment. I am mending one of the boys' shirts. They are not easy on their clothes, you know. There's no need for you to do that. Oh, I enjoy it. And I won't have a chance much longer. What do you mean? Oh, you're sending them away to school, aren't you? Yes. I won't be able to take care of all of them now. Well, it's probably for the best. But it will seem lonesome around here without them. Emilie, I haven't told you or the boys yet, but I'm giving up the house. Oh, no, monsieur. Yes, I have to. There's no way I can keep it. But-- but where will we go? Emilie, I've been wondering all day just how to tell you this. It's probably the hardest thing I've ever had to say, but I'm afraid you'll have to go home. I know it's horribly unfair after all you've been to us. But I promised Mrs. Stoddard. You've got to face the facts, Emilie. It's-- it's simply that there's no room. If it's in any way possible, I hope you'll be back again with us soon. You'll come, won't you? You know I will, monsieur. It sails at 12:00 midnight, miss. He's fast asleep. Poor little fellow. It's probably the latest he's ever been up. I couldn't leave him alone in that awful apartment. No, of course not. Monsieur, let us go back now before it's too late. There must be a way I can stay. You'll need someone to take care of Phillip. I've told you the money doesn't matter. Please, let the driver turn around. Emilie, believe me when I tell you there is no other way. Don't wake him, monsieur. Let's say goodbye here. No. I-- I've-- No, please. It's easier for me. Goodbye, Phillip. Goodbye, monsieur. Goodbye, Emilie. I hope you'll be back with us again soon. I'll live for that, monsieur. Come on, son. Oh, yes, yes. You're a sleepyhead. Where is Emilie? I want Emilie. Don't worry, son. She'll be back-- I promise you. We're pretty far from the top of the mountain, son. Are you tired? Yes, Daddy. We'll do all right. Come on, son. Remember the grass always grows greener in the valley. You'll have to be a little patient with me till I get the hang of this. This isn't exactly in my line. No, no, you're a good daddy. Well, we're down to our last penny, son. We've got control of that. There's only one direction we can go now, and that's up. And that's just the way we're going. With your help, I can do it. Yes, Daddy. That's good. Good boy. I knew I could count on you. Emilie was right. This is my legacy. Well, Phil, this is it. You remember it? You bet. It's gonna be pretty nice, isn't it? Yeah, it's beautiful. With its face washed, its hair combed, and my boys inside, it'll be Stonehenge again. Oh, Otto, let's check over the kitchen supplies. Are you Phillip? Yes. How did you know? I know the story here. Where do you live? Over there. Have you been here long? Three years. What's your name? Vance. I often come and look at the house. How are your brothers? Going to war. David's enlisted in the Canadian Flying Corp. The others are in training here. I'm too young, but I may enlist. I like you best. How can you tell? You've never seen my brothers. I can tell things. Phillip. Well, who's this young lady? Dad, this is Vance. She lives over there and she can tell things. How do you do, Vance? I hope we'll be good neighbors. How do you do, Mr. Stoddard? How old are you? Fifteen. Oh. But my father tries to keep me a baby, so I humor him. Don't you think I should put my hair up? No, I-- I think it looks very pretty as it is. When are you going to move in? Next week. And is Emilie coming back? Emilie? Yes. Yes, of course. And so are the rest of the boys. Well, it's nice to have met you, Mr.Stoddard. Thank you. I hope, my dear, that we'll see lots more of you. Thank you. Well, goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye, Vance. Bye. She's a funny kid, isn't she? I'll bet the next time we see that cute little thing, she'll have her hair up. Mlle. Gallatin? Yes. Here. Special, mademoiselle. Welcome home. Oh, monsieur, the house is so beautiful. Everything has been redecorated. Otto. I'm happy to see you again, mademoiselle. Oh, Otto, just like before. I'm so glad to see you again. Tell me, where are the boys? Didn't they get here? No, not yet, sir. Well, they got their leaves all right. I wonder what happened? Oh, why, I can't wait to see them. Oh, monsieur, this house is so wonderful. Attention! We salute Emilie! Boys! Oh, Emilie, you look wonderful. Oh, boys. You are so big. I'm Jack. Oh, Phillip. Phillip, oh, when I saw you the last time, you were so sleepy. Nah, we couldn't fool her. She knows Jack when she sees him. I haven't changed much, have I? No, you haven't, Christopher. No, you can't fool her. She knows Jack isn't here. That's right, guys. Hello, Jack. Now, where is David? He's due any minute. Now, then, where's the living room? The living room? Well, let me see, where-- the living room is there. So where's the dining room? There. Well, come on, boys. Oh. Oh, where are you-- That's the way it looks to me when the war's over. So Phillip is going to be a lawyer. Now, look at this lawyer. Oh, what's the matter with that? And Christopher an artist. And Jack? Jack's crazy about automobiles. He's probably out in the garage now, tearing the engine apart. And David? What does he want to be? David. Say, that reminds me. Maybe I'd better call Montreal. Where is everybody? Oh-- That's David, isn't it? Emilie's right. He did get here. Sure I got here. Hi, fellas. Hello, Dave. Oh, well, well, son, you've been away a long while, but you look fine. You're late. A little, yes. Oh, David. Emilie. Oh, it's nice to see you. Why, I knew your voice, didn't I? Yes, you did. Yep. What is "yep"? Oh, she's pretty. Does everybody here like surprises? Sure. If they're good, yes. Oh, it's a beauty. What is it? Stand right where you are. Don't anybody move. He's nervous. I wonder what he means. I never saw him like that. He didn't even kiss me. Here she is. Dad, this is Hester, my wife. Well, this is a surprise. Welcome to the Stoddard family. I know you'll be very happy here. Tell me all about it. Here's the story, Dad. I met Hester at the canteen in Montreal. Dad, it was love at first sight. I sail in two weeks. Two weeks? Yes. You don't have to worry about him. He's the best aviator I've ever seen. It's wonderful to have a girl believe in you like that. Yes, David. It certainly is. Well, honey, I want you to meet the family. Here's Phillip. He's the baby of the bunch. Hello, Hester. Hello, Phillip. And here's our Emilie, back with us again. How do you do? How do you do? I know you two are going to be the best friends in the world. Oh, here's Chris. Hello, Hester. Hello, Chris. Well, say something. What do you think of her? She's wonderful. Oh, am I a lucky girl. A husband, a father, and three brothers, all in one stroke. And where's Jack? I think he's in the garage. Oh, well, you haven't seen anything yet. Just wait till you meet Jack. Dad, I'm gonna take her out to meet Jack. Didn't I tell you she was wonderful? That certainly was a surprise. David, dear, do you think the family really does like me? How could they help it? Yes, but that isn't answering. Do they? I do. Isn't that enough? But do they? I want everybody to like me. Oh. Jack! Jack! Hi, Dave. Big surprise. I'm married. Well, for the love of mike. This is my wife. This is Hester. Hello, Jack. I'm all grease. I don't mind. I've worked around soldiers. Well, congratulations. Aren't you going to kiss me? Well? If you don't, I'll never forgive you. Well, I can't disappoint my brother. Nor your sister. Dad? Yes? Yes, son? What kind of a mood are you in? You must want something. Well, my mood is fairly accessible. I wanted to talk to you about Hester. Mm-hmm. Well, there's nothing unusual about that. You like her, don't you, Dad? Why, yes, of course I do. You see, Hester hasn't had any close family. And except for me and us-- well, she's all alone in the world. So, after I leave, how about it, Dad? Wouldn't it be all right if she lived here while I'm away? Why, of course it would, David. I think it'd be fine. Oh, you do? Really? Oh. Oh, you took a load off my mind. Well, I'm always glad to do that, David, when I can. You're swell. Why shouldn't I be glad to do anything for you? You're my son, aren't you? Well, anyway, Dad, you're-- you're coming through for me now. I hope so, son. Oh, Emilie. That was the kiss that he didn't give me when he arrived. Oh, what about it, monsieur? Wouldn't it be nice if you gave a dinner party for David's wife? Asked all his friends? That is a good idea. I should've thought of that and I didn't. You see, that's how badly we need you here. You know, Emilie-- Dad? Dad? How can I thank you? Then you will like living here? Like it? Oh, it's wonderful. I'm so happy about it. Well, then, everybody's happy. Everybody. Emilie just made a brilliant suggestion. We're gonna give a dinner party for you and David. Oh, you're a sweetheart. Oh, I'm gonna see Otto right away because I've got a few ideas of my own. But it took Emilie to think of it in the first place. So, the party was your idea, Emilie. Yes, madame. Why madame? Don't you want to call me Hester? You are the lady of the house now. Oh, you did understand then. Yes, it's nice to be Mrs. David Stoddard. It is a very enviable position and I hope you will be happy. I think you're trying to be politely insulting. What do you mean? I'll ask you a question. Why are you here, anyway? Surely, you don't think the boys need you now. I think they need me now, perhaps more than ever. What does a woman think of when she crosses the ocean to be governess to four grown men? Or perhaps it wasn't the sons that brought you back. Perhaps it was another interest altogether. Did that hit the mark? Emilie. Why, you two girls still here? What is this, a conspiracy? Yes, Dad. We're planning all sorts of things to please you. That's fine, darling. Call me when you want me, Emilie. She seems like an awfully nice girl. I'm glad you like her, Emilie. Ah, don't you, monsieur? Oh, yes, yes, of course. If I had any, uh, worry of any kind, it might be that, well, I thought she was a bit too good-looking. Well, there they are. Time you got here. Welcome, welcome. Hello, Aunt Phillipa. Are you all right, Phillipa? Of course I'm all right. Be careful now. It was a wonderful ride. Careful, now. Careful. You be careful. David, you've grown. How do you do, madame? There's my old friend, Emilie. You've very pretty-- a little pale. Why don't you rouge? Why, I'm so glad to see you, madame. Where is the bride? Here she is, Cousin Phillipa. Hello, Cousin Phillipa. Here I am, waiting to welcome you to Stonehenge. Mm? Mm-hmm. Mm. Mm. Well, the same old step, Phillipa. Same old legs, you mean. Same old house. I thought you said you'd done things to it, Adam. Well, wait till you see the inside. Same old tree. Oh, yes, same old tree. Ah. Same old hall. Be careful here. Don't you think it's swell? Too light. I like darkness because my deeds are evil. Hello, Phillip. Where you going? I'll be right down. Mm. What do you-- would you like a cocktail, Phillipa? Adam, you know better. Gin. Straight. What? Before dinner? Before dinner and after. All right. It's your stomach. Anybody can have it that wants it. I'll get you the gin. Uh, Jack, you'd better order another case of gin. Cousin Phillipa knows what she likes. Do you smoke? Only cigarettes. Bad habit. Skidaddle. I want to talk to the bride. No alienation of affections now. Hmm. Come here. Sit down. So, it was a case of love at first sight, huh? Oh, yes, Cousin Phillipa, it was. There's no such thing. Why, I-- Don't fool yourself-- though I don't believe you have. It's David that's fooled. Why, Cousin Phillipa. How many times have you been engaged before? Why, I'm only 19. 19 is as 19 does. Cousin Phillipa, you don't like me. Give me a reason to and I shall. Is that my gin? Yes, madame, in a big glass. This girl has intuition. Thank you. Uh, may we come in now? Come in. Everybody here? Yes, yes, we're all here. Well, where's Phillip? Where is he? Oh, Phillip's upstairs. Oh, David, see if you can find him, will you? Hey, Phil. Coming. Your good health, Phillipa. Look. Look at Phillip. Phillip. But you're so young, Phil. You're just a boy. Young? He's no boy anymore. He's a man. It's not so easy to be brave when the baby goes. Baby? Oh, don't be angry with me, Phillip, but you were the baby once. All right, son. A telegram, Mr. David. Thanks. Congratulations, Phil. You don't have anything to worry about. What do you know? Our sailing date's been moved up. I won't be able to have that dinner with you after all. David. Come and help me pack. Chris, will you get the car out? Sure. Heaven help the Kaiser now. That's not such good news. Oh, David's a great flyer, Dad. There's nothing to worry about. Is he really good? I mean, up there in the air. Is he good? Why, Dad, he's the last word. Dave could knock 'em out of the sky with a bag of oranges. Did you hear that, Emilie? Huh, well, that's good. Dad, can I take your second-best raincoat? Yes, son. Take anything you want. Don't you worry about Dave, Dad. When he gets-- Emilie. Are you all right, madame? Yeah. Something's the matter with the cigar? Don't taste right. You're pale. My heart's been growling at me lately. I suppose it's a little sick of me. We've been together a lot. A glass of water, madame. No. I hate water. Dull dish. Well, I-- I'll call the doctor. Emilie, don't let them know. Well, I wanna say goodbye to Cousin Phillipa. All right. Well, Cousin Phillipa, any messages for anyone over there? Just tell 'em they made a mistake when they started fooling with us. I'll do my best. Oh, God bless you. Goodbye. And remember, David, don't try to do it all by yourself. Don't you worry. Just leave it to me. Come on, honey. Good luck, son. Thanks, Dad. I don't have to tell you to be brave. You couldn't be anything else. Oh, you'll see. I'll be back before you know it. I hope so. Oh, my love. I shall think of you every moment while you're gone. Goodbye, sweetheart. Hey, come on. All aboard if you wanna get there. I won't be living until you're back again. Goodbye. Goodbye, David. Goodbye, Emilie. And God protect you. Thanks. Goodbye. Darling. Write as often as you can, son. Take good care of yourself. Don't forget the way back. Oh, madame, I shouldn't have left you. It's all right. Come closer. The doctor will be here any minute. To the devil with the doctor. Listen, that woman... watch out for her. She's to be reckoned... with. Emilie... Well, David was the first to go. Cheer up, Hester. The boys tell me David's a great flyer. She wouldn't let me tell you while David was leaving. Good morning. Good morning, Vance. Oh, you're over bright and early, Vance. Yes, I am. Come on, darling. Sit down. Have a cup of coffee. Thank you. I've had my breakfast. Have there been any letters? There was a letter from Phillip that might interest you, perhaps. Is he all right? There's a note in it for you-- all for you. Where is he? He couldn't tell us exactly, but he's somewhere in France. Oh, by the way, David has been transferred to the American Flying Corps. So, Dave and Chris are both at the front now. David and Chris fall on deaf ears. Hmm? Oh, yes, yes, I'm glad they're both safe. I guess Jack will never be sent across now. I don't see why Phillip couldn't have been kept here too. They just pick on Phillip. Yes, uh, there's a conspiracy at headquarters against that boy. What are you all going to do today? Oh, I'm going into New York with you. Oh, that's fine. Oh, may I drive down to the station with you? Yes. I want the walk back. Oh, that's fine, Vance. Hester, what are you gonna do today? I wish I knew. Can't you think of something I can do, Dad? Well, you just try and be as happy as you can, hmm? But I'd be happier with something to really do around the house. Mary won't let me in the kitchen and Emilie doesn't want any help. This place runs itself so well there's nothing you can to do help. And, Dad, I did want to do something to make you happy. Why, now, that's sweet of you, dear. Monsieur, I'm afraid we'll miss the train. Yes, all right. Goodbye, dear. Goodbye, Hester. Jack! Jack! Well, I don't know when I ever wanted to see anybody so much. Who's home? Nobody's home. How long can you stay? I've got two days, Hester. Stingy. Now let's be thankful for that because then I'm to be transferred. To where? South. Camp Wadsworth. Maybe. Maybe? Well, I might keep you here. See? Where is everybody? What's new? Nothing is new. Dad's working, Emilie's gone to New York, and I'm playing solitaire. Want a drink? Sure. Scotch and soda? I wouldn't mind the soda. What time does Dad get home these days? Oh, usually about 5:30. What's the matter with this? Not wasting any time. Two days, Jack. They can fly. But time doesn't fly for me. I can tell you. Well, what have you been doing? I told you. I've been playing solitaire and pacing the floor. You know how many squares there are in this carpet? How about another one? Well, it wasn't made to be looked at. Hey, this thing must have a leak in it somewhere. I'll tell you what let's do-- Let's go into New York too, huh? Oh, now, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Why wait? I never understood waiting. Why do you wanna wait for? You're a little lit, sister. All right. Why did we drink it for? To stay sober? Oh, well. If you won't go into New York with me, we'll have to do something else. What'll we do? I don't know. I know. Let's play hopscotch. Where is something to toss? Something to toss, something to toss. Something to toss. Why, hey, now, wait a minute. This is my new uniform. I'll fix that later. Come on. And you stay on the same square with me. Hester. Jack. What? I wish you weren't his brother. Hester. Well, you asked me. I'm going to forget you ever said that. You're just lonesome and restless and it doesn't mean anything. I was sorry you were his brother when I met you in the garage. What did you marry him for? I like David. You didn't love him and-- and you knew it? I've never loved anybody the way you're talking about. Oh, Jack. Jack, I like you. Hester, you don't know what you're saying. You're saying things you'll regret. You'd like to call me bad names, wouldn't you? But you don't quite dare. Well, just so you won't, I'll kiss you. I didn't know there were any women like you. You've got something to learn, Jackie. Ooh. I wish you could see your face-- trying to look so fierce, and all the time, you're glad-- you're glad, you're glad. Don't put up any fight, darling. We're sure to be, ever since that moment in the garage. Didn't you know it then? Thanks, my dear. That was-- that was charming, as always. Very lovely. Very nice, Emilie. Come on, Jack. I'm going to teach you to dance next, Dad. Oh, no. No, no, you're too late. I learned that before you were born. Why, Dad, you've been holding out on me. Oh, I'm still sorry you're his brother. Be quiet. Come on, Emilie, don't stop. Keep on playing. Well, you people may be used to late hours, but it's after taps for me. I don't see why you get sleepy. I'm not sleepy. Well, I confess, I am. Besides, it's late enough. It's time to go to bed. Oh, we have a big day tomorrow with Jack home. I still don't see why we waste time going to sleep. Hester, you have too much pep. Is that a compliment or not? Ah, you must get your beauty sleep, young lady. Well, good night. Good night. Goodnight, Dad. Goodnight, son. It's good to have you home. Thanks. Good night, Emilie. Good night, Jack. Well, thanks for playing. And thanks for being here. Oh, monsieur. Good night. It's good to have one of them back, even if it is only for a few days. Yes, monsieur. Remember your first day here? Oh, so long ago. We didn't know then that we'd be left alone here some day, did we? No, we didn't. You chinned yourself eight times. Nine, monsieur. Oh, yes. That's right, that's right. Well, good night. Good night. Hester. Open that door. Jack. Open this door. Jack. Hester. I know you're in there. Jack, it's Emilie. Jack. Jack. Emilie. I'm sorry, monsieur. You and Jack? Please. Dad, Dad, you mustn't think anything-- No, no, don't explain. But, Dad, you mustn't think-- Don't explain. No explanation necessary. Why, Dad. What is it? Oh, nothing. Nothing, dear. Anything I can do for you? No. No, thank you. Good night. Good night. Oh, Emilie. I want to thank you for what you did for me last night. For you? I wasn't thinking of you, Hester. Emilie, you got me out of a scrape. I did it for Jack and Mr. Stoddard. Dad will forgive you, Emilie, even if it did look kind of peculiar because you're-- well, such a little Puritan. Don't count too much on my protection. Are you threatening me? Warning you. Don't worry. I'm too smart to get into a jam like that again. I hope you are. I wanna thank you again, especially knowing how you feel about Dad. Can you look me in the eye and say that you're not in love with him? You see? But there's no real reason for us to quarrel, Emilie. Good morning. Good morning. May I speak to you, monsieur? Yes. Yes, Emilie. Of course. I feel that you may want me to leave and I didn't want to wait for you to tell me so. No, Emilie. I've been thinking things over. You and Jack were very indiscreet, to say the least. I did feel strongly about it last night, but after all, I realize that if you and Jack care for each other, which I-- I hadn't even guessed before, I have no right to say anything. After all, your ages are not so far apart. We'll just say no more about it. Let's try to forget it. How happy those boys must be to be home again. There are a lot of wounded among them. All of us, watch both gangplanks at once. No, dear, you don't have to. This is for casualties here. I see Chris! Where? Dad! Oh, my boy. Emilie, Emilie. Emilie. Oh, Hester. Chris, where is Phil? Wait. Can't you say "Hello, Chris," first? Yes. All right. Hello, Chris. But where's Phil? Now you be patient, darling. He'll be along. Where is Phil? Dad, I came on first on purpose. Phil didn't let you know, but, well, his eye... His eye is hurt. He's hurt? Don't make any fuss now, Dad. He never wrote us a thing about that. Phil! Dad! Oh, Vance! Emilie! Phil! Sorry, lady. Jack, ol' pal, how are you? Let me see. A patch over the eye. Well, let's be thankful it's only one, Phil, huh? That's what I say, Dad. You're still he best-looking boy I know. Well, we've got you back, that's all that counts. Mary, Mary, quite contrary, how does your garden grow? Don't make pretty speeches, Chris, or you're liable to get me all aflutter. Hand me that other box. That's a good boy. Now help me up. I wonder if you know how good-looking you are. Hah-hah, don't kid me. And I was the first to discover it. Uh, have you got any errands? I'm going to the village. You are? What a coincidence. I have to go in too. Will you take me with you? Sure. I'll get Dad's car. And I'll get my coat. Hello, Jack. You're not going any place with Chris. Why not? Because you're coming with me. I wanna talk to you. Where are we going? You'll find out. Oh, Jack. You're so bossy. Hester, we're going to get this thing settled once and for all. What is this? You know what it is. Stay away from my brothers. Can't I be nice to them? Will you stop that innocent stuff? You've begun on Chris. Next thing, you'll be after Phil. Jack, I'll tell you the truth. I've been trying to make you jealous. Jealous. You've been treating me as if I were poison lately. You are-- especially to this family. Oh, Jackie. Now, don't start that again. I'm through, Hester. I can't stand you. How can you say that, Jackie? Have you forgotten? No. I wish I could. Mrs. Stoddard, Mr. David is back. David? Have I really got you in my arms again? Oh. Jack! Well, handsome, how's the old boy? I'm fine, Dave. How are you? Just get in? Yes. Oh, honey. I can't help it, David. I'm so happy. Oh, Dad, I've lived this moment a thousand times over. I can't believe it's real now. Well, it's real to us, all right, isn't it? And it's a happy day for me to have all my boys around me again. Now's the time for champagne, huh? Champagne! I've been saving a special bottle just for this occasion. All right. Come on. I closed my eyes and made a perfect landing. You did? Yes. Right on a hospital bed, looking up in the eyes of a pretty American nurse. Oh, a pretty American nurse, huh? She wasn't as pretty as you, honey. Uh, goodbye and thank you very much. Goodnight, dear. Glad you could've been with us. I'll see the babe through the woods. I don't think Hester should have anything more to drink, David. Oh. Come on, darling. We can't do all our celebrating in one night. What's the matter? The party over? Yes. Yes. We're gonna call it a night. I've gotta get up early in the morning, even though the rest of the household doesn't. Anything Dad says goes. She's monstrous. How could I ever get mixed up with a woman like that? I've dreaded David's getting back, but this worse than I thought. When I see them together-- I can understand how you feel. I-- I can't look David in the face, and I can't face you, Emilie, or Dad. Look at the mess I've got you into. Everybody. Don't think of me. But I have to. And I've got to do something about it. There's nothing you can do. Yes, there is. I can go straight to Dad and tell him everything-- especially about the night in my room. Now, what good will that do? Hasn't he suffered enough? Oh, we can't keep this up forever. We must-- for a while, at least. And with David home now, things will be different. Dad would know at least that it wasn't you up there. The blame would be where it belongs-- on Hester and on me. Yes. You want him to know it was David's wife-- your brother's wife. It would break your father's heart. His heart is breaking as it is. What do you mean? Dad loves you, Emilie. Don't you know that? Why do you say that? Because it's true. Haven't you guessed it? I thought a woman's heart told her such things. I dare not trust mine. You can. If Dad has to go on believing there's something between you and me, that makes it so cruelly unfair to you, Emilie, and to him, because I know that you love Dad. My duty is to stand by the family. Do that again. What? What you're doing, moving your arm like that. The brush through your hair. Oh, really. Oh, you're so beautiful. Oh, you always say the sweetest things, Jack. Oh, my darling. Jack! Jack? Did I say Jack? How silly. I meant to say David and I said Jack. Oh, after all, he's your brother. I could've said Chris or Phil, but I said Jack. Why, what's the matter with you? Why are you looking at me like that? You're not jealous, are you? Oh, you don't think there's been anything between Jack and me, do you? Between Jack and you? Oh, David. Between Jack and you. David, you're hurting me. David, leave me alone. I only said-- You've said enough. Just because I try to explain-- What is there to explain? You haven't got anything on me anyway. Haven't got anything on you? Suppose it is true. Suppose I did everything you have in your suspicious mind? What are you gonna do about it? Leave me and divorce me? Go on and do it. I'll tell a mouthful on the stand. That'll be a pretty story for your father to carry to his grave. The family. The precious Stoddards. Hmm. Good morning, Mr. Clark. Hello, Phillip. How are you, Chris? We're all right, Mr. Clark. There's nothing wrong, is there? We don't quite know. You see, David-- well, we can't find him. David? Didn't know he was back. Well, he just got home yesterday, but he disappeared without leaving any word. He must've left early in the morning. Maybe even in the night. Oh, we've looked everywhere. We wondered if perhaps you can help us. Why, I-- well, come in, boys. Let's get this straight. Now, Hester-- I've already told you. I heard him get up and go out. I didn't ask. I don't like to nag. I think it's dreadful of David to scare us all to death like this. Try to think. Didn't anything happen that might explain his leaving? How could it? It was his first night home. We were all so glad to have him back. A little quarrel or anything? Quarrel? Why, how can you even say such a thing, Emilie? Haven't I suffered enough without you intimating anything so dreadful? Dad, David's car is down at the station. Station? The station agent said he saw it there when he came to work this morning. That was before 5:00. This whole thing is becoming very mysterious. Maybe the war did something to his mind. No, I don't think the war did anything to his mind. I'll get on the phone, see what I can find out. Well, there's no use in keeping this up with me, Hester. Something happened to send David out last night. I don't know what you mean. Oh, yes, you know what I mean. Did David find out what's been going on? Going on? Is that why he left? Now don't try to fool me. Tell me the truth. I won't listen to such talk. I won't stay. I just talked to the sheriff. He said not to worry. He's gonna check into everything. Well, come on, Jack. Drive me to the station, will you? Hello? Yes. Oh, just a moment, please. It's for you, Mr. Stoddard. Hello. Yes, this is Adam Stoddard. What? David's in the hospital. Hospital? Yes? Yes. He's been in an airplane accident. He's unconscious and pretty-- pretty badly hurt. How'd it happen? All right. I'll be right over. Thanks for calling. What is it? What's happened to him? I don't know. I don't understand it. He went to the airport. They told him the weather was bad, but he didn't pay any attention. He took off and went into a dive. Oh, David! David! Otto, get my raincoat and hat. I'm going with you, Dad. Let me go with you too, monsieur. No. You stay here with Hester. She'll need you. Yes, monsieur. Jack, remember you promised-- not a word. Otto, will you please call a taxi? Yes, mademoiselle. Oh, oh, it's you, Emilie. Isn't it terrible that an accident should happen to David, his first day home? That was no accident. Emilie. David didn't go out last night for nothing. He didn't crash his plane by mistake. He knows what you are now, doesn't he? Women like you always betray themselves. I'm not responsible for what people imagine. Now why don't you get out of this house? Why don't you show the least bit of decency and leave? Before you came, there was love, loyalty, and pride in the family. And then you came, and you brought hate and lies and suspicion. Once this house was strong and good, and you brought evil to it. You have no right to talk to me that way. Please go. Go before you hurt anybody else, please. You're being very childish, Emilie. I beg you. Does Dad know how you feel about me? Does he? Why don't you tell him? Because you can't tell him-- that's clear. Because Jack and the Stoddards have got to be protected. No. You can't talk me out of this house. What are you doing? What are you doing? Have you gone crazy? This family has been my life. You're not going to spend another night in this house. Here. That's all you need and I'll send the rest. And I will make all the excuses necessary. There's a car waiting for you. Now I suppose you're gonna lift me up and throw me out bodily. Yes. That's exactly what I'm going to do. You're hurting me. Come on. Emilie, Hester. David's going to be all right. David's gonna pu-- Well, what is this? What's the matter? There, now. What's the matter? Dad, I don't know how to tell you-- Now, control yourself, child. What is it? It's Emilie. Emilie? She's gone crazy. She wants me to leave the house. Do you know what you're saying? She hates me. She's hated me since I first came. Oh, no, no, that's impossible. Why, Emilie likes you. No. She wants everything her own way. She wants to keep all of you for herself-- this house and everyone in it. She can't stand another woman being here. She resents me. And she won't be satisfied until she gets me out! I can't believe this. It's-- Emilie, it isn't true. It's-- Hester's mistaken. It's just a misunderstanding, isn't it? Emilie, you must have something to say. You're making it very difficult. Dad, I'm terribly sorry I've had to bring all this trouble to you. Tell me, is David all right? Is Jack with him? Jack will be here in a minute, and David's going to pull through, yes. Is he conscious? Yes. But he's alone? He mustn't be left alone. He may do something. He may-- What-- what did you say? Nothing. I've just got to be with him, that's all. He's my husband. What did you mean, "He may do something"? Nothing, Dad, nothing. Hester, look at me. Look at me. I want an answer. Why did David leave the house? Why did he fly when they warned him not to? You're imagining things. No. I'm just beginning to see things. He wanted to do away with himself. That's what you're afraid of, isn't it? Answer me-- why did David wanna kill himself? Why did he? Dad... I'll tell you why. Jack, no. Dad, don't believe him. Don't believe him, Dad. I've been wanting to tell you for a long time. It's a lie. That night in my room-- Dad, don't believe him. It wasn't Emilie. It was Hester. May I come in? Come in. Emilie, it's taken me a long time-- Well, I would rather we didn't speak of it, monsieur. But we must speak of it. I owe you so much. I've come to ask you to forgive me. Forgive for what, monsieur? Jack has told me everything. Oh, he shouldn't have. I-- I begged him not to. This family has always lived by the truth. I couldn't be hurt by it. I only know that Hester is leaving the house. There's one more thing too. The boys, David and Jack. This thing might separate them. Oh, no. It can't. Nothing is strong enough. Oh, I know your sons, monsieur and I have faith in them. Your house will be put in order. Now there's nothing to fear. Well, your family will be whole once more. I believe you, Emilie. I believe you and I'm-- I'm grateful to you. Thank you, monsieur. Emilie, in the last few hours, so many things have become clearer. I know now that I don't want to be alone. Emilie, will you share my legacy with me? If you wish, monsieur. Not "monsieur." Adam. Adam. Adam.
