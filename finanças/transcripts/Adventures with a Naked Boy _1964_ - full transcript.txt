ADVENTURES WITH A NAKED BOY Written by Based on the Story by Cast Production Designer Make Up Artist Costumes by Sound Editor Film Editor Music by Karel Vlach's Orchestra Conducted by Additional Cooperation Executive in Charge of Production Director of Photography Directed by Made by the Creative Group AS THE DEMANDING VIEWER MAY NOTICE, THIS FILM IS SET ON A PRAGUE TRAM IT IS BECAUSE FILMS COMMONLY REQUIRE ASETTING. HOWEVER, THAT IS WHERE ANY SIMILARITY TO ANYTHING THAT ONE MAY RELATE ONE'S SELF ENDS. Hold this for me and let me talk to him. No. Wait! - The boy is completely naked. - I am aware of that. I see. It's all right. He is aware of it. - Is it your son? - No, I'm only taking him home. - Is it some silly bet or what? - No. - Then why is he naked?! - His clothes were stolen by the river. Can't you cover him with something? This is outrageous! I beg your pardon! That child... Calm down. He is aware of it. Everything is all right. I see. How can it be all right? It's not allowed to travel on a tram naked! I see. It doesn't matter anyhow. - I'll not travel with a naked person! - Neither am I! - Conductor! - Conductor! - Conductor! - This isn't happening... - Conductor. Conductor! - Hello! You'll never wake him up. Conductor! Conductor! Wake up! Conductor, there's a naked person in your tram! What? What did you say? The trouble is, I don't know whether we can carry naked passengers. You can't. It stands to reason! I wouldn't be so certain. The public transport rules say nothing about that. Could you put a handkerchief around it at least? But how can anyone mind, sir? He's just a little boy and his clothes got stolen... He lost his way and he lives on the other side of the city. You ought to put a handkerchief around it. I will file a complaint! - Cover him! - I don't understand... - You heard me! - But I... In that case, you can either get off or buy a new ticket. Why should I buy a new ticket? Because you shouldn't travel naked on a tram. I will consult this matter. He's all at sea... - Do you hear me? - What's up? - I need your advice. - About what? - I've got a naked person in my tram! - What did you say? - I've got a naked person in my tram! Naked person? I hear, you said, a naked person. - I did. A naked person. - Quiet! Quiet! I don't know, I've never heard... And is he completely naked? We ought to call the chief. I said, be quiet! - Children! Rascals! - I said, be quiet! He won't even cover the boy! Cover him! Why don't you cover him? I don't understand why it is bothering you so much. - Cover him! - Yes, yes! Cover him! - Cover him, please! - Cover him! - He will never cover him. - He must cover him! - Cover him! - Cover him like this man says! Cover him! Cover him! - Cover him! - I won't cover him! - It's not allowed. - I'll make him get off then. Come to think of it, the public transport rules say nothing about... If he lit a cigarette, we could set him off. Let's offer him a cigarette. The driver should decide. Is that you? Thank God. There's a naked person in the last wagon. What am I to do with it? As the driver, you're the one who is fully responsible! Yes, yes, but in fact... But I'm only... a fellow of no mark. An invididibum, I mean an individuum. A stupid and foolish fellow. An idiot. While we together... We are jointly responsible. Not just me alone! And we have to make a joint decision. Do you understand? Let's go. - You will listen to us! - I won't! It's a small child! Leave the child out of this! This is about principles! Cover him! - He covered him. - I thought he would. - Goodbye grandam. - Goodbye. What's the matter? Why didn't he stop? The trouble is that now are naked you! Quiet! Sit down over here. (SEAT FOR DISABLED) - Are you very upset? - No... Not to worry, everything will be all right. Remain seated. Keep an eye on him. This is unbelievable. He takes his cloth off in a tram. At least he has his trousers on now. I've never seen anything like that. I hope you will cover yourself! Cover him! The chief conductor told you to be quiet! Didn't you hear! Stop yelling at us and restore order instead! - Quiet! - I'll not travel with a naked person. - Why don't you get off then, old hag? - Who said that? - Who said that?! - Show yourself! Who said that?! You will keep quiet. Quiet. Excuse me. Thank you. There's the exit! What are you doing? No, no. Nothing's the matter. We have a naked person in the tram. Yes, come and get him. Wait a moment. And did you said thank to the gentleman? - I wonder what's going on there. - I don't know. Let go of me! I didn't do anything! Stay away from me! Why aren't you fighting? Everybody's fighting... - Here you are! - Let me be! Gentlemen, please, take me with you. You've got to take me with you! I opened eyes and I saw naked people... I need treatment. You've got to escort me. You have to help me. I see naked people. Which one of them is it? - Wait! That's not him! - It's not me. - You're coming with us. - But I... Come. Come. - I'm the driver. - Hello. - Officer, hey, officer! - What do you want? - Take me with you, please. - Come here. - Address! - I want to take down the address. - Be sensible, please! I won't let you go. I'll hold you here. You've got to take me with you! Take me with you, please! Who wants his address. He should pay for all the damage. Come, Bojar. - Watch out! - Stop pushing. Come. They're giving his address! He'll pay for all the damage. Hurry! They're paying damage compensation. - What compensation? - They're paying out compensation.
