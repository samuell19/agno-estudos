Subtitles by explosiveskull Hello? Anybody? Please. Hey. Please. Did you hear that? What is that? Pass it over here. Hello? Oh my god. Oh my god, can you hear me? But keep this woman, oh King of kings, beneath thy almighty wings. Oh God, the spirit of all our joys, the cause of our delights, the glory of our darkest nights, and the comfort of times like these. Strange, isn't it? Everybody's always smiling. I keep just waiting for her to walk in and stop all this nonsense. It's Aubrey, isn't it? Aubrey Parker, right? From Spirit 105 AM. - I remember you. - I remember you. I didn't know you knew Grace. Hey. Hey. I don't know how he does it. Mark, I mean. I don't know how he puts up with all the consoling. I couldn't handle it. I didn't know what to say to him. I just left. He looked right at me. I'm Alice, once of Grace's English cousins, obviously. I'm Aubrey. You're Aubrey? God, I don't think I ever had a conversation with Grace where you weren't mentioned. You escaping? Yeah. Yeah. I have a flight in the morning that I gotta catch. Your speech was really beautiful. I love hearing about grown ups as kids. Well, you should go. Yeah. I'm sorry to ask, did you get her letter? She was obsessed with this song. She kept playing it over and over again. It seemed to be something that helped. She'd take her walks, and the music, she kept saying, "Aubrey would understand. "Aubrey would get it." I still don't know how you drank this shit. Oh, fuck. Hungry? Hey, Bellini. No bitey bitey, okay? Perv. Hello? Hello? My name is Aubrey Parker. And I broke into my dead friend's apartment. Who the fuck are you? Who are you talking to? Hey, mom. Aubrey, I didn't recognize the number. Yeah. Honey. How's your night? Are you okay? How did it go? It went. Was Edward there? Did you get to speak with him? No. Oh, honey, I'm sorry. Look, I think... Do you remember... We're the ones... are going to... Okay? I think you're cracking up, mom. Honey. Baby, I wish you were here. I wish you could just fly... For the holidays... It's so... Yeah. Time zone. Sweetie? Well, I just wanted to hear your voice. Wait a minute. I'm... Honey, I can't hear you... Mom, I can't hear you. Listen, make sure you get... Okay? Happy New... Baby. Happy New Year. Now, let's take a little trip back in time, just you and me, Nate Fowles, on this beautiful crispy New Year's Eve right here in the mountains on Sparrow 103. Edward. What the... Hello? Hello? Hey! Aubrey. Aubrey. Aubrey, can you hear me? Can you hear me, Aubrey? Aubrey? Can you hear me? Yes. Yes, yes, I can hear you. Listen to me carefully and do exactly as I say. I don't know what the fuck is going on. Close your eyes. Take the walkie and face it toward the door. What? Face it toward the door. Okay. Fuck. Stand up. Stand up. Walk toward the door. Aubrey, keep your eyes closed. Walk toward the door. Well, that's encouraging. What is? You want to live. What? What the fuck is going on? You're going to want to go back upstairs now, and lock the door. It's going to be okay, Aubrey. How do you know my name? I knew Grace. Now, I need you not to be scared, Aubrey. I need you not to panic. I know exactly how you're feeling but we can help each other, I promise you. I think there's a way out of this, Aubrey. Hey, stop saying my name. How did you do that? Do what? Before, in the diner. It was like a signal or something. You did some kind of signal and you made it leave. It was the signal. It caused all of this. Would you just tell me what the fuck is going on? Do you have to understand everything to accept it? You're not answering my question! That's because you're not listening yet. Okay, well, what did you mean when you said that we could help each other? The final part of the signal was transmitted last night. It caused all of this, the snow, the monoliths. Look, Grace found something. It's in the apartment with you. What do you mean? What did she find? She left it for you, the first part. Hey, there are people out there, and I think that they need our help. You can't help them, Aubrey. - But they need our help! - Stop, Aubrey. What the fuck is happening? What the fuck is happening?! I need to go. Please don't go. Please don't go, please don't go, please don't go. Please don't go. Maybe I'm dead. This makes me cringe talking into this, listening to my stupid voice. You were always so much better at this than me. Anyways, I'm not sure when I'm sending this to you, if I send this to you. But, I figure you'll be the only one to take this remotely seriously. I trust you to help me, or to tell me I'm being an idiot. Someone found something, this group. They uncovered some signal. It was buried in a radio transmission and there have been others, I mean before. We started to find them in all sorts of transmissions. It's what I've been working on. I'm trying to help them. It started as just fun, conspiracy bullshit, you know. Oh, Aubrey, there's a correlation between events, disasters, natural disasters. The patterns repeat. They seem to form a chain of signals that link together in a loop, but we're missing one: seven. We have the rest, or I have the rest and .. I mean, we think the signal is only dangerous fragmented, like computer code, in pieces it corrupts, but put it all together... There are people after it. It's all fucked up, Aubrey, and I'm a little scared... and excited. I'm hiding the rest of the tapes, okay? Where we used to go. You'll figure it out. I hope. I buried each signal in songs. It seemed apt. I hope you enjoy them at least. It's been a while since we made each other mix tapes, hasn't it? I miss it. If nothing else, it'll make a great mix tape for the next road trip we take. I feel stupid talking to you like this right now. Where are you? You should ring me more often, stupid. I have to go back to the hospital tomorrow for some more tests. It's the strangest thing, not being able to trust your own body. I need to get out. But it feels good, you know? To have a secret. Aubrey, pick up. You left me. I had to. You had to see for yourself. You played the signal, right? You have to be careful. The signal is very powerful. It opens doorways. I think the creatures... I think they came through one of these doorways, but they also seem scared of it. Is everyone gone? Or hiding. I don't know. My mom? My dad? How come you're alive? I told you. I knew Grace. We were helping each other. But she's dead now, isn't she? Tell me what you think it is. I don't know exactly, but we have ideas. The signal might be a natural pattern, something older than us, something necessary, repeating. It could be manmade, a new kind of warfare, something we don't know about yet. It could be... just coincidental, a pattern simply because we want to see one. Tell me what you really think it is. What if it isn't random, the signal? Transmitting for decades buried in our transmissions, repeating, looping, echoing the same pieces, waiting to transmit in the right order to make a chain of code. Maybe all science doesn't need to be based on the same systems. Maybe there is something, something out there, that uses sound waves as the foundation of its science, sound waves used not just for communication, but for interaction, for warfare, for exploration, for travel, for opening doorways. What if the signal... is them trying to come across to us? When I first came here I didn't know what I was looking for or what I was hoping for, but you know what used to be my dream? My absolute favorite fantasy... was for everyone to just disappear, for the world to just be devoid of distraction, empty shells of empty lives, empty cities, empty streets, just trees... and brick. Grace said that she trusted me to decide what to do. Aubrey. Aubrey? Aubrey, you have to help. We have to stop it. Aubrey! Aubrey, listen to me! Aubrey! You might think that being in this forced close proximity means that we're going to become great friends. Don't count on it. The home for everyone is to him his castle and fortress, as well for his defense against injury and violence, as for his repose. I wonder if the world still exists if I choose to ignore it. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; I account it is high time to get to sea as soon as I can. It's official. We're out of food. We're almost out of water, and sooner or later we're going to run out of batteries. I'm open to any suggestions. Yeah. Maybe I don't want to. Oh, fuck you. I'm allowed to be scared. Yeah. Yeah, I know. This makes me cringe talking into this, listening to my stupid voice. You were always so much better at this than me. Anyways, I'm not sure when I'm sending this to you, if I send this to you. But I figure you'll be the only one to take this remotely seriously. I trust... The patterns repeat. They seem to form a chain of signals that link together in a loop, but we're missing one: seven. We have the rest, or I have the rest and... I mean, we think the signal is only dangerous... And excited. So, I'm hiding the rest of the tapes, okay? Where we used to go. You'll figure it out. I hope. I've buried each signal in songs. It seemed apt. I hope you enjoy them at least. She kept listening to it over and over again. On her walks. Around town. You built something. You built something, didn't you? Something that could recognize the signal, and it did, the night that I arrived. Seven tapes, one you gave me, seven you hadn't finished yet. That was the final piece. Okay, Grace. You get one chance. Let's try it your way. So we can protect ourselves, only if we have to. Wake up! Want to know the saddest thing about everybody being gone? Everybody being dead I mean. All the lost stories. People are going to die anyways, but their stories don't have to. Hey. Hey. How have you been? I have these dreams... where you talk to me, like you're still here. I'm here. How have you been? I can't feel my fingers sometimes. It's called disassociation. You're pulling away from the world. Why? Because I can't forgive myself. What for? Is this real? I'm dead, stupid. I mean all this, everything that's happening, is it real? Do you want it to be real? I didn't want to leave the apartment. Why? Because I didn't want you to be gone. But I am gone. I can't do that. I don't think I can do that. You have to do what makes you happy. If you're not happy, you can't make anybody else happy. - I told you that before. - I don't believe that. I think that you're wrong. Well, you're not dead, are you? So what do you know? What if making someone else happy is what makes you happy? Why haven't you taken it off? I can't. Why? Because it's a reminder of everything bad I've done, of how much that I have to make up for. But you can't make up for it, can you? No. So what are you going to do? I don't know. Can you tell me? Can you please tell me? Be happy. I can't. I'm suffocated. You cheated. I cheated. You have to live with that. You have to confront it. Stop... hiding. I can still remember the sound of the waves and the sand on my palm. We're just people, wandering around, bumping into each other. No. No, we aren't. So what are you going to do? I'm going to stay here. And I'm going to never leave. Sounds like a plan. I'm so sorry. For what? For not being there for you. When you... When you needed me. You were always there for me. I wasn't fucking there for you, and I should have been there for you and I wasn't. I'm so sorry. I didn't know. I didn't know. Yes, you did. Please forgive me. I just want to go home. I just want to go home. Yeah, no, that's actually true though. Yeah, that's a very accurate drawing right there. Let's go on a walk, Bellini. This is ridiculous, that you're here. You know that right? It's ridiculous. Just ash, dirt, fucking ash. If you can hear me I'm guessing that you already know everything that's happened, so I'm not going to bore you. I got the message. Don't worry. Okay. Welcome back to Sparrow 103, your local... Fuck. Oh, fuck. Hello? Hello? My name is Aubrey Parker, and... I think I might be the last person left. I don't know... I don't know if I did anything to fix what's going to happen, but... I really hope that I did. So... If there's anybody else out there, now's the time to say something. Hello? Anybody? Please. Please. Hello? Oh my god! Oh my god, can you hear me? Yes. - We can hear you. - Holy shit! Are you okay? - Are you okay? - Yeah, no, I'm safe. I'm safe, I'm at the radio station. Did you say we? There's a few of us. Why would you think you were alone? Well, I just, I thought that I'd been alone this entire time. I didn't realize. Why are you at the radio station? Wait, how do I know that you're real? We're real. I figured it out, I stopped it. Figured what out? The signal? You know about the signal? We know about it. Well, yeah. I found all the pieces and I put them together. I sent the reply so it's okay now. I closed all the doors. So you took the message they sent, the one that caused all of this, you put it back together for them, not knowing what it was, what it did, and you... and you sent it back? You shouldn't have done that. You didn't close the doors. You opened them. Aubrey. Aubrey. Pick up! Aubrey! Aubrey! She's at the radio station! Subtitles by explosiveskull
