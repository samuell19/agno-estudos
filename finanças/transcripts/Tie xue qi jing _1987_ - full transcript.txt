I can drive at 160 or 170 km per hour to reach the turn. Please don't do that. Any physical contact, and you will be tossed out. -Really? -See it for yourself, moron. Don't get into trouble. He doesn't believe me. Check your bike. -The mechanic had checked it. -It's better to be cautious. Fai, check my tires' pressure. Front tire should be 32 and back tire should be 35. -They'd been checked this morning. -Check it again. It was shaky last night. Ignore him. They are repairing Tin Kwong Road, so be careful. Tin Kwong Road, is it? Officer 49, don't mistake your round as a tour. I get thirsty. If Officer Suey sees you eating on duty, you'd be dead. If you don't tattle, who'd know? Sooner or later, somebody would file a complaint about you. -Officer Suey, I'm done. You're welcome. -Okay, thank you. -Have you checked your bike? -Yes. -How about yours? -Yes. -Be careful. -Yes, Sir. The bike at the front, pull over. License plate number 1497... Pull over right now! Pull over! Go on. Run. Can you get away now? Driver's license please. Dai Chu? Your driver's license has been revoked for a long time. Officer, please. I know Officer Suey. Which Officer Suey? Inspector of Anti-speeding Team. Do you know me then? No, Officer. Trying to bluff me with Officer Suey's name, I see. Don't ever ride a bike again. Sir, he was throwing your name around. It's useless even if he knows the superintendent. Impound his bike for examination. People like him shouldn't get on a bike. Yes, Sir. If you like to race, go to Macau. -Driver's... -Good morning, Sir. Driving license please. Officer, you ruined it. Ruined what? Look at my speedometer. Do you know how fast you went? 160 kilometers per hour! Sorry, Officer. We were shooting a commercial. Look. A commercial? Yes, we were shooting a commercial. Here. I have a permit. Look. This permit only allows shooting, not speeding. Sorry, Officer. The director told me to drive fast. Sorry, Officer. Give me a chance. Here's my business card. My name is Tony Morris. I don't usually speed. Please, I would never do it again. I'll let it go this time. -Next time, don't speed. -Got it, Officer. You have dark skin and the car is very white. I'll definitely remember you. Actually the three of us are equally dark. Shut up and go. Yes, Sir... Thank you, Sir. -Go. -Be careful when you drive. -Thank you, Sir. -Don't drive too fast. -Go. -You're very kind. Pull over... Pull over here. -What is it, Officer? -Driver's license please. Why? I'm charging you for driving into a rat's cage. What is a rat's cage? It means the bus lane. Your driver's license please. Officer, it's time. Is it? If it's time, I'd have been off work by now. Hurry up! One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, 11,12, 13, 14... 15 kids in total. Officer, I'm sure you understand my situation. They are all kids. I'm in a difficult position. Exactly. That's why I'm charging you with one more offence, "chickens in a small cage". What's that? It means overloading of passengers. Understand? What happened was my neighbor Seng told me to give his son a ride. This is my first offence. Give me a chance, please. Give you a chance? I've been waiting the whole morning before I got you. If I go back and got scolded by my superior, who would pity me? Driver's license please. Liao Ah Tsan. Uncle Tsan, what should we do? What can we do? I have to pay up. This officer has no sympathy at all. -What a reckless driving! -Sorry, Officer. -Driver's license please. -What? Driver's license. Officer, I have to bring my son to see a doctor. He's burning up to 104 degrees. My boy... Are you all right? Drive carefully and slowly. Follow me. I'll escort you to the hospital. Be careful. Son, don't worry. It's going to be fine. We came across a great guy. I've never met such a nice officer before. Paging Inspector Li. The traffic light at Tseuk Luk Street is fixed. The road has gone back to normal. Any further instruction? Got it. Patrol the vicinity, over. Got it. Officer 235 paging Inspector Li. The lost car has been towed back to the station. After you settle everything, you can go home with the guys. Got it. Inspector Li paging Officer 32. Officer 32, can you hear me? Where are you? Mechanic Wen. How's things? Uncle, you got into an accident again? Yes, I got bumped by a near-sighted guy. If his license is not revoked this time, he should at least got deducted 14 points. Nah. He was trying to send his son to the hospital. He was flustered. The tail light is gone and indicator light has come off. This is a small matter. That guy was lucky to meet you. If he met the Four Heavenly Kings, he can forget about driving again. Come, fix it for me. And don't put it in record again? Since I started, my record has always been clean. I don't want to taint it. You're 20 dollars short. Since last week, the price of tail light has gone up. Really? I won't lie to you. The Four Heavenly Kings. Has something happened? These four guys must have given me trouble again. Come, help me fix this first. Don't let Inspector Li find out. Okay, tea's on you later. Sure, go. How is it? Has he given a statement? Officer, you don't have to impound my car, do you? Four Heavenly Kings! Come over here. This is all your fault! Your fault! Your fault! Stop pushing the blame to me. If you didn't want to do it, we couldn't have forced you to. You and Inspector Li are good friends. You have to take this on. -Me again? -Of course. Inspector Li! Why did all of you put the siren on? Did somebody jump off a building? No, Inspector Li, we just wanted to test it out. Right, Inspector Li. The parts didn't work too well. We were just trying to fix them. Right, the tires were squarish. We were trying to make it round. Yes. If other colleagues get on them, they might crash. Right. Stop making things up! I know your riding skills are outstanding. Just be careful. What happens if you get into an accident? If you die, there's nothing left. You can get a new bike if it's wrecked. But I don't want the Four Heavenly Kings to become the Three Musketeers. Yes, Sir! -Uncle. -Yes, Sir. Take care of the Four Heavenly Kings for me. They were speeding back with siren on. -Guys, why do you always get into trouble? -Inspector Li. -Who was the leader? -It was him. Not me... -Thank you. -Thank you, Sir. Please, just give me some peace. -Come with me! -Okay. -Sir, I'd nothing to do with it. Trust me. -Shut up... Sir, I'll get them back for you. No need. Let's go. -Sir, give me a chance. -I've given you numerous chances. -I really had nothing to do with it. -You said so every time. Do you have inside information for tonight? Officer 49. Inspector Li. Inspector Li. How come you're off work so early? I got changed at four o'clock on the dot. I've finished more than required. Two rat's cages, three overshadowing nets, one chickens in a small cage. I charged six people in total. You charged five cases and received complaints from four of them. Are you in a hurry to watch the horse race? No. Watch him. He is clueless about time. Yes, Sir. Kao, can you come see me before you report for or leave work? Okay. -Supervise your subordinates when you work. -Yes, Sir. Bro, you might want to be a foot soldier forever, but I don't want to. I want to get a promotion. Can you help me out? Sure. What an unlucky turn I took. Ran into him and got berated. If only I can pick the winning horse like I run into the inspector. The roster is all done. -Officer 1325. -Sir. -Is everything done? -Yes, Sir. Good. Rocky, put your subordinates on a tight leash. If a bike is wrecked, we are one bike short. But we can transfer in more guys if they die. -Am I right? -Yes, Sir. Whose car is that? My father's, Sir. Where are you going tonight? Shall we race for a round? Shut up! Haven't you done enough? -Bye-bye, Inspector Li. -Bye-bye. Sir, this is my father's car. Driving a car like this will get ICAC on your back. I hardly drive it. Once I do, I'm broadcasting my father. -Bye-bye, Inspector Li. -Bye-bye. Where are you setting up a roadblock tonight? At Clear Water Bay. The place is very foggy. So? We still have to work. Exactly... -Give him a ticket. -Okay. That was fun. Let's race for a round later. Hey you! You can give me a ticket, but don't scratch my car. You won't be able to pay for it. Go ahead and give him a ticket. Ignore him. Officer, you're very handsome and gorgeous. Please watch your manners. How dare you piss off our Officer? How rude! Apologize. I'll punish you if you don't. You too. For 280 dollars, they watch two cars for us. Officer, are you upset? Were you rude to the officers? No. Get in the car. I like a wire transfer. -How dare he gave me a ticket! Crazy guy. -That's right. -Get back to work. -Yes, Sir. Stop it. Come on. I said stop it. Be careful when you drive. Billy! I'm fine. Billy, don't drive so fast! It's fun! Go faster... Watch out! -Hurry... -Don't worry. I won't wreck it. Everything you have, you got it from him. What are you doing? Darn it. -You don't mind, do you? -I do! It's a camera. It's taking pictures of speeding cars. -Kuang. -Yay! They took pictures of us speeding. What should we do? Don't worry. It's not the first time anyway. Handle it like before. Stop! Pull over! Lower your window. Mister, you were speeding just now. Driver's license please. Officer, how's your mother? Pull over! This is preposterous! I asked for his driver's license and he asked how my mother was. The car was driving too fast. We couldn't get a picture. Over. -What a lousy camera! -That's right. We don't even have the license plate number or any pictures. What should we do? White Porsche. I only asked for his driver's license. -Supervisor is very angry. -What does my mother have to do with this? How dare he! -Don't be mad. -That's right. Mun. Registration for joining Macau's Advance Team is closing. So what? -Are you joining? -Are you sponsoring me? Sit down. Sit down. Inspectors are here. Shut up. Sergeant, you were reprimanded, weren't you? None of your business. Stay out of my business. -Good morning. -Good morning, Sir... How do you feel? Good... I have a good news and a bad news. I'll tell you the bad news first. Two of our colleagues are going back to school. Officers 554 and 258. You are going back to school to polish your riding skills. It had nothing to do with us. It was the bikes. It had nothing to do with me. -Officer 70, I told you to watch your guys. -Officer 32. -Yes, Sir. -Watch Officer 33. He used twice the usual amount of gas last month. Told you not to ride fast. You got me scolded, too. -Told you not to ride fast. -Shut up! Do you think you're racing at Lisboa Bend? Crazy guy! Wise up! -Officer 49. -Yes, Sir. You have two complaints filed against you. You used the wrong law when you issued a ticket. -Also, you were rude. -He gets complained all the time. After work, go and see Inspector Chen from the Complaint Team. Yes, Sir. Seriously? I say "please" all the time! How can I be rude? -Shut up! -Yes, Sir. Also, there was a group of kids riding bicycles at Mong Kok. They rode recklessly, causing four cars to crash. When you go on patrol, watch out for them. Inspector Luk, you go on and on, and you haven't told us the good news yet. Right, what's the good news? The good news is this year, you'll have a 6.6 percent pay rise. Are you kidding, Uncle? -That news is dated. -That's right. -Officer 235, tell them the patrolling areas. -Yes, Sir. Officer 14375, position one. -Officer 2538, position two. -Good morning, Sir. We had a problem with the roadblock last night. Pay attention. Last night, at the roadblock of team four, two cars budged through. We're not sure of the license plate number. Both plates have 123 at the end. Both cars are Porsche. One's white and the other one is unclear. If you see these cars, pay extra attention. Yes, Sir. It'd be great if I see them. I'd chase them until the end of the world. Shut up! How can our bikes race with a Porsche? If my bike isn't fast enough, I'll make it up with my skills. -You will crash. -Hey! Shut up! The weather is quite bad lately. Be careful when you're patrolling. Yes, Sir. -Are you done? -Yes. -Fall-out. -Fall-out. Don't think about racing all the time. I have great skills. I'm not scared. Let's go. -Uncle, you come with me. -Okay. -Let Tai take care of the rest. -Got it. Bobhead, why are you moving so slowly? Hurry up! Yes, Sir. -Don't scare them. -Got it. Kids, pull over! What? Pull over! What? Pull over! Darn police! Want to come after me? Let's see who's faster. Even my shoulders are faster than you. Everybody, pull over! A beautiful turn! Awesome! Get off the bike.... Get off the bike.... Stop! Don't go! Officer, come get me! Darn kids! Let's see where you're going now! Officer, do you want your keys? Go... Don't ever let me catch you. Darn it! Go... Attention, all units. There's an accident at the turn of Tai Mong Tsai, Sai Kung. The patrolling unit at the vicinity, please go to the scene to assist. Uncle... Are you all right? -Are you all right? -I'm fine. -Get the bike up first. -Okay. What's going on with me lately? I have an unlucky streak. Don't change your tire at a turn. -Look, it's dangerous. -Sorry, Officer. Sorry for making you crash, Officer. So sorry. -Uncle, you'll be the commander. -Yes, Sir. Sorry, Officer. I didn't mean it. Look, you have a bus filled with kids. There is traffic everywhere. I'm sandwiched in between. My hands are tied. Shut up already. Fix it! Hurry up! Thank you, Sir. Stop... Let them go. Look, it's pretty. Take your time. Lower the vehicle. Loosen the screws. -And then raise the vehicle again. -What's taking so long? -Understand? -Thank you, Sir. It's the police. Are you scared? I'm not scared. Officer, we're not overloaded with chickens today. Chickens? -And we didn't drive into a rat's cage. -Right... Who taught you that? The other police charged us for chickens in a small cage and driving into a rat's cage. -Right... -Really? Officer, please don't charge Uncle Tsan. I'm not charging him. I'm just holding off other cars for him. -Or else, other cars might hit you guys. -I see. What's your name? Ho Tsu Chung, but Mommy calls me Bobbie. Bobbie, I'm done reading it. Here. -Did you draw this? -Yes. -That's incredible. -Of course! When I grow up, I want to be like you. I'll have stars on my shoulders. -You have to study hard then. -Got it. Pull over! A sports car! Darn it! Sir, I'll go after him. Don't. If you do, he will get a kick out of it and cause a bigger trouble. Tell the guys to stop him only under safe circumstances. Otherwise, just let him be. Yes, Sir. Sir, gangsters like that must be arrested. Otherwise, he's going to kill someone. Fix your bus first! Yes, Sir. -Hurry. -I'm starving. DD123. The model of the car is Porsche 944. The car owner's name is Tony Wong, 54 years old. His ID number is... Tony Wong? Isn't he famous for publishing porn magazines? Hong Kong Central... Inspector Luk, the car owner is over 50 years old. He doesn't have a driver's license. Why does he have a Porsche? He could've lent it to someone else. Stupid! Inspector Li, the driver was a young man. Officer 25, call the car owner to come here and assist with our investigation. Yes, Sir. Oh right, May, please check all vehicles under his name for me. Yes, Sir. This guy has over 10 Porsches. He must have a big garage. Not only that, he also has several Rolls Royce's. Inspector Li, he said he is busy and asked you to go see him. Darn old man! He's arrogant. Okay, we'll go meet him. You're an idiot! You knew I'm running for member of parliament next month. Why did you publish this? Do you think I am a gynecologist? Do you want me to get prosecuted? Did you ask Attorney Chen before publishing? What a moron! Boss, your son said the cover lady is his friend and asked me to publish it right away. Are you hired by me or my stupid son? You've published hundreds of thousands copies. Tell me. How can I show my face out there? Change the cover right away and sell them in mainland. Boss, this is a great ideal! Remember. Remove the names of the publishing manager and the publisher. Remember that! What is it? I said no calls! Sorry, Mr. Wong. A group of police officers want to see you. Who is it? Even a pig or a dog has a name. It's Inspector Li from the Anti-speeding Team. It's Inspector Li from the Anti-speeding Team. Tell him to come in. Please go in. What is it? What else? They must be here for my stupid son. I have to take care of his stupid business. -Get to work! -Yes. Boss, your son's driver's license has been revoked. As long as he didn't kill anyone. Take care of it for me. Are you Inspector Li? I am Tony Wong. Please come over here. This way please. This way please. Have a seat. Sit. What would you like to have? No need. We're on duty. We hope you would assist with our investigation. I'm more than willing to cooperate with the police. You know, intellects should do our part in the society. Am I right? We must serve as role models. Mr. Wong, according to our search, you have quite a few sports cars that bear records of reckless driving and other traffic offences. We're here today to ask for the information of the drivers. You make a fuss here today for a small matter like this? Traffic cases? I pay 20 to 30 thousands of fines every year. I don't owe the government a cent. It's not about the fines. Yesterday at 12 noon, a car with license plate number DD123 under your name did not pull over as instructed by the police. I just want to know who the driver is. I have so many cars. How would I know who drove my car away? Inspector Li, I am Chen Yik Ming, an attorney. If my client committed any traffic offence, you can subpoena him. Don't bother to come all the way here. Right. I don't need you to teach me what to do. I am here today to prevent a serious accident from happening. Inspector Li, from the point of view of the law, what hasn't happened, didn't happen. Isn't it a waste of time to discuss it now? That's right. When something happens, you can come to me again. To be honest, I'm quite busy today. I'm busy too. Since you won't cooperate, we will conduct investigation on our own. Let's go. Stupid boy! How come there are so many traffic cops? Are you here to arrest someone? They must be here for a bribery. If they can't get any, they're going to be pissed. When traffic cops show up, they look like crap. They are completely useless. Right. Traffic cops... This is a raging traffic cop! Right. Moustache cop. Father, did you get blown away by the traffic cops? Stupid boy! Come with me. Get in! Who drove your car last night? What is it? What else? The cops were looking for you. -Why? Nothing happened last night. -That's right. -We didn't even get a ticket. -Nothing happened last night... I don't know what I did wrong in my previous life. Why do I have you since I was 167? Father, don't be angry. Do you have any money? Money? Get lost! Father, if you don't give me any money, I'll kill myself. If I have another son, I'll let you die! Father... -You made it. -Yay! We came here only to be humiliated. Inspector Li, only you can put up with it. What else could I do? Quarrel with him in uniform? He had a lawyer there. The more we said, the more mistakes we could have made. Why is the car parked like this? Inspector Li, this car is outrageous. I told him not to park here and he parked another car to block our way. I said I'd give him a ticket. He told me to go ahead and give him as many as I wanted. No wonder he said he paid hundreds of thousands of fines. Inspector Li, shall we teach him a lesson? How? Break his window or scratch it? We are only allowed to impound it. Do it. This is the kind of people who waste police resources. Get to work. You take care of it. Yes, Sir. It's a waste of time to engage people like them. They're arrogant just because they have money. Officer, how are you? Little boy, it's dangerous to stick your head out of the window. -Sit down, Bobbie. -Sit back down. -Take care of the kids. -I'm going now. Bye-bye. Bye-bye. Don't stick your head out again. Bye-bye. Here. If you can get us, we will pay you. Bobbie, don't engage the police. Or they will give me a ticket. No, the police only catch those who drive recklessly. Yay... Commando, don't bump his tail. He gets a kick out of it when you do it. It's over 100km per hour now. Slow down! Hi! -Loser will treat high tea. -Hi! -Oh, you're going to lose! -We'll see! -It's pretty. -Give it back. It's fun! Mommy... Are you all right? Help! Anyone there? -The school bus crashed! -This is serious! -Inform Inspector Li now! -Yes, Sir. Help! All units at the vicinity to go to the scene. All the kids are injured. Over. Page for two more ambulances to come over. If you're fine, help him out. Come help! Hurry! -Are you all right? -There are many kids in there. Come help! Thank you... Paging headquarters. Send an ambulance to the scene. A kid is stuck in the bus. Over. "AMBULANCE" Just now, a car overtook us at the double white lines. I tried to avoid it and crashed. -Do you remember the license plate number? -123... -What car was that? -Porsche, it was a Porsche. There are over 10 children that are being treated and on the way to the hospital. Tell the hospital to get ready. -Officer 33. -Inspector Li. -Any kid stuck in the bus? -They are all out. -Where's the driver? -He's in one of the ambulances. He said he saw a white Porsche overtaking him at the double white lines -and forced him down the hill. -Did he get the license plate number? He said it was 123. -123 again? -Yes. -Uncle. -Yes, Sir. -Go to Tony Wong's house to make an arrest. -Got it. -Page for Accident Investigation Team. -Yes, Sir. -Hurry... -You two, gather a team to come with me. We'll go to Tony Wong's house to make an arrest. -Hurry! -Watch it. Come... -Hold on to him. -Drive! -Hurry! -Mommy, it hurts... Out of the way! I want to go home! Bring more blood. Hurry up! Mommy! -Why didn't you get the license plate number? -It was driving fast. -I forget the first letter, only 123. -Okay, we'll go into the room and talk. This one is dead. How's my son? -What's his name? -Yip Chi Keong. -He's over there. -Okay. That jerk overtook me at the double white lines and caused the accident. How fast did he go? I don't know the exact number. It's either 130 or 120. -Give me back my son! -Calm down! Listen to me. Listen to me! Calm down. What are you doing? Get out! Calm down. It isn't my fault! Do you think I want this to happen? -Get out! -Calm down. Calm down. Your son is fine. Attorney Chen is in a meeting. He can't take your call. I am Tony Wong. This is urgent. Please wait. You know... I told you I'm not taking calls. Attorney Chen, Mr. Wong needs to speak to you urgently. Okay, I'll take it. Is it Attorney Chen? Yes, Mr. Wong, how are you? My son ran over someone. What should I do? Traffic accident is a small matter. No, the police is making an arrest. Don't let them in. Wait for me. Come quick. How is it now? How long do you want us to wait? -How is it now? -We'll let you know... Calm down. Officer Four, have you notified all the parents? -Officer 227 is notifying them, Sir. -The bus was pushed down the hill... -Tell them to calm down. -Yes, Sir. I want to see my daughter... Tell us. Can't we, the parents see our kids? How long do we have to wait? You must register yourselves first. This is the procedure. Address? Telephone number? Tell me... Officer, let me see my son. We'll make arrangements... -What is it? -How's my son? What's your son's name? Tell me his address and telephone number? Ho Tsu Chung... It's Ho Tsu Chung, isn't it? Where does he live? How's my son? We'll make arrangements. What's your phone number? Calm down. Don't panic. Listen to me-- How's my son? -Who's your son? -Ho Tsu Chung. Bobbie? Yes, how is he? Madam, listen to me. You son's fine. I don't need you to console me. How is my boy? Your son is in surgery. You can't go in there! Don't mind me. As long as the kids are all right. -Have you taken his statement? -Inspector Li, almost done. Officer, the car came out of nowhere. Get your injury treated first. -I'm fine. -Got it. Go ahead. But the kids are innocent. -Sit down. -Yes. -Wait. Inspector Li. -Thank you. Inspector Li speaking. Inspector Li, the owner of the house won't let us in. Okay, wait for me. I'll be right there. Mr. Wong, the team leader, Li Chih Chieh of Anti-speeding Team is known to be harsh. When he gets here and you don't have anyone for him, he will arrest you. What? Me? Why? I don't drive. You're crazy! You're the car owner. Under the law, you are responsible. Stupid boy! Every time he gets into trouble, I have to take care of it for him. Hello. Where the hell are you? -Billy's driver's license is already revoked. -Get your butt here! Yet he managed to create trouble this big! Thankfully, he wasn't caught at the scene. Otherwise, he'd definitely go to prison. What? He'd go to prison? No, you must not let anyone arrest him. I don't care how much money it's going to take. You have to take care of it for me. Okay, let me talk to Billy. Billy, this case is tough. If something goes wrong, either you or your father will go to prison. But don't worry. I'm here. Listen. Firstly, don't drive the car back yourself. Secondly... Inspector Li, the lawyer said we don't have a warrant and wouldn't let us in. Let's see how Inspector Li take care of him. I want to see Mr. Tony Wong now. If you don't open the gate, I'll charge you with obstructing police business. Officer, don't be angry. Mr. Wong invites you in. Go straight and turn right. Don't go anywhere else. Isn't this the car that overtook at the double white lines? I gave a ticket to the driver of this car too. We better impound all the cars here for examination. He's got money. Impound one and he will buy another one. Say what you want but don't scratch it. -How dare you! -Even the guard is arrogant. Save it. The door's that way. Wipe your feet before you go in. Sir, the police are here. -Serve tea. -Yes. Inspector Li, do you have to come all the way here? Come. Have some tea. We are here to arrest the owner of car CN123, Mr. Tony Wong. You are under arrest for an accident involving a school bus this morning. This is an arrest warrant. Inspector Li, my client is happy to cooperate and hand over the driver. -Where is he? -He's on his way. What's wrong with you people? You've blocked the entrance. How am I supposed to get in... I will give you a ticket back this time! Get your cars away. -Father. -Billy, come over here. Who drove the Porsche this morning? It was Commando. He'd been driving it the whole time. You heard it, Inspector Li. Officer, I drove that car. We are cooperating. We get him here right away. -Rocky, arrest him right away! -Yes, Sir. -Officer, be nice. -You can talk after we get to the station. -Officer 32, send the car for examination. -Yes, Sir. Don't let me catch you obstructing justice. Officer, I promise I won't do that. -Bobhead, don't let anyone touch the car. -Yes, Sir. -Be careful. Don't scratch the car. -Shut up! Another word and you'd be arrested. Out of the way! Uncle, after you've arranged for a tow truck, -go back and take his statement. -Yes, Sir. Come in, close the gate. -Where are the rest of the Porsches? -They are wrecked. Don't hit me. If you do, I'll kill myself. -Uncle, don't hit him. -Uncle, don't be mad. The insurance will pay. -That's right. -It's okay to wreck the car. If you die, you will desecrate our ancestors! Father... Commando's case needs $200 000. What? Just give it to me. If I never had you, I can save two million dollars every month. -If you don't, I'll go to prison. -Hey. What should we do? Shut up. Father, if you don't pay, I'll be in trouble. How fast did you go? 50 kilometers per hour. Really? Officer, I hardly drive over 50. My life is precious. 50 kilometers per hour? How did the school bus got bumped down the hill then? That was a coincidence. The driver must have lousy driving skill. He got himself down the hill. Get him to retake the driving test. Did you overtake the bus at the double white lines? What? What double white lines? Do you think I'd do something so stupid? By 2:00 in the afternoon tomorrow, submit your insurance and Vehicle Registration Book. The bus driver said you went over 120 at that time. Darn it! You won't believe me anyway. Fine. Charge me with whatever you want. Whether it's reckless driving or illegal racing, I don't care. Hey. Do you know three kids died and eight kids were badly injured? What? Did I kill them? Go ahead and press charges. Deduct one point and I'll get 5000 dollars. Going to prison for one month, I'll get 50,000. Hurry up! Don't waste my time. Are you even human? How could you say something like that? Moustache boy, I'm here to cooperate. Why are you so naggy? I'm not here to be reprimanded by you. -Darn you! -What did you say? What? Moustache boy, go to hell! -Police beat me! Help! -What did you say? -Help! -What did you say? Say that again... -I'm going to kill you! Darn it! -Help... What did you say? I dare you to say that again! Go ahead! Calm down. How dare you cuss my mother! Wearing this uniform gives me sunburn when it's sunny and super wet when it rains. I may be run over at any moment. And now those scums cussed my mother. Is there any meaning to this job? Inspector Li always tells us we are in law enforcement. When we are on duty, and somebody says anything, just ignore it. How? I thought only low level officers would get such treatment. I studied hard and became an inspector, and I still get cussed at about my mother. Even a deaf person hears that. Uncle, some people do it on purpose. They are ill-mannered. Why bring yourself to their level? I can't bring my mother to work, can 1? I know how you feel. But have you thought about it? Without annoying police officers like us, how much faster would those people drive? How many more mothers have to rush to the hospital looking for their kids? Many people like to challenge the law. If we surrender, it's pointless to be a police officer. Thank you so much. Why? Did anyone beat you up? What? Beat me up? Nobody would dare! Are you bluffing me? Those police officers are very fierce. Fierce? They surrounded me but wouldn't lay a finger on me. -Are you all right? -I'm fine... For traffic cases, at most we'd pay a fine. Inspector Li. Billy. Inspector Li, I told him to not to park there but he asked me to give him a ticket. He's a scum. Ignore him. -Okay, bye-bye. -Bye-bye, Inspector Li. I'm scared... I'm scared that I don't have any money. Calm down. Money will solve everything. Get in the car. It hurts. Are you bleeding? Are you all right? There's no brake. -Oh no. -l don't know. Why did you hit the brake? Mister, my car has no brake. Are you all right? No, he hurt his head. My car has no brake. I told you not to drive so fast. You only got your license less than a month ago. Now that we got into an accident, what are you going to do about it? I don't know! Call the police for me. Be careful when you drive and you won't have to bother the police. It hurts! Don't worry. It hurts! -Nurse. -Inspector Li. -Are the kids all right? -They are fine. How about Bobbie? How come he isn't here? His mother transferred him to a private room over there. Thank you. Bobbie. Officer. -Did you sleep well last night? -Yes. -Does your leg hurt? -Yes. Don't move. The doctor said you can't move around for now. -Inspector Li, you're very early today. -Dr. Ho, good morning. Bobbie, does your leg hurt? Yes, doctor. It itches too. Don't move. You'll get better after a few days. Understand? No, it hurt a lot last night and I didn't move at all. Good boy! Bobbie, is this sketch book yours? You don't draw scouts anymore. You have a liking for drawing traffic police now? When I grow up, I want to be a policeman like you. Listen to the doctor. When your leg gets better, I'll let you be a traffic police. I have to wait until I've grown up then? -Bobbie is a very good boy. -He is. Inspector Li, you're very kind. You come visiting the kids this early in the morning. I'm here for official business, too. This is a serious case. I need more time to write the report. Right, has the culprit been arrested yet? This is a troublesome case. And the bus driver can't identify who the culprit was. We could only ask the car owner to hand over the culprit. I thought no one would come disturbing us after transferring to a private room. Okay, bye-bye, Bobbie. Bye-bye, Officer. Bobbie, are you hurting? Mommy, don't scold that Officer. He is a good person. He didn't give Uncle Tsan a ticket. Okay, good boy. Go to sleep now. Rest well, okay? The police officer got this back for me. Inspector Li, we are civil servants. We are used to being yelled at. -Her son is injured. She's in a bad mood. -You are right. It's hard to blame her. -Dr. Ho. -What is it? -A patient needs you. -Okay. -I won't bother you any further. Bye-bye. -Okay, bye-bye. Inspector Li. What a coincidence. What are you doing? Are you waiting for that car, 123? Yes, I think the culprit of the accident with the school bus must be the rich kid. That guy was just taking the blame for him. The problem is we don't have enough prove to charge him. I checked with the Accident Investigation Team. Billy Wong had his driver's license revoked two years ago. One of his father's car was reported to be stolen. It was related to a hit-and-run that killed someone. I think that car must be scrapped by now. It must be gone. People like him are like time bombs. We don't know when they will blow up. If I ever see him racing with my own eyes, I will chase him till the end of the world. He wants you to. It's a game to him. His sports car only takes six seconds to speed up to 100 kilometers per hour. Our bikes haven't reached the second gear yet. How are we going to go after them? If we don't arrest him at the scene, he will use loopholes of the law to get out. The law will always have loopholes. He did it on purpose. Let's pull all the information together and open a file to show our boss. It's better to get a special team to serve him, isn't it? The kids were badly injured because of him. When I get on a night shift, I will set up a roadblock to intercept him. Be careful when you do that. He's cold-blooded. He will run over the roadblock. "OUTWARD BOUND HONG KONG" Go somewhere else. For all we know, he hasn't got out of the bed yet. People like him will get what's coming for him. Pull over! What are you doing, Officer? Are you all right? -Are you all right, Officer? -Officer, I didn't mean it. Officer. Bobbie. Is your Mommy here? -Mommy went to work. -Got it. Officer, have you caught the culprit yet? I'm still investigating. I'll catch him soon. The flowers are very pretty. Thank you. -They are a gift from other officers. -I see. Do you want to be a traffic police when you grow up? When I grow up, I want to catch bad guys like you. Smart boy! You have a good ambition. You don't have to wait any longer. I will make you a traffic police now, okay? It's really nice. -You are the most awesome kid now. -Yay. -Do you like it? -Yes. Bobbie, you look great! You are the most incredible superintendent in the world. Officer, how can a limp ride a bike? Others can't. You can. -Really? -Yes. Bobbie, on patrol duty! Bobbie, be careful. -Inspector Li, is this your day off? -That's right. -Official business? -We're here to take a statement. Bobbie. Inspector Li is very nice. He comes here to visit the kids. What happened? Forgot to take a turn. It's fine. Do it again. Go... Officer 4432, help out at the scene at Lung Cheung Road. Over. Paging Inspector Li. Yes, go ahead. Over. Team one's roadblock is all set. Over. Got it. We will go over to you now. Over. I'm not sure twitching at the left eye is bad luck or the right. Are you okay? My eye is twitching. You have something in your eye. That's it. Don't be superstitious. Be careful when you ride. Go slow. Yes, Sir. -Inspector Li. -How's everything? -Everything is normal. -Okay. -Inspector Li. -Uncle. -How is it? -Inspector Luk. -Inspector Li. -Are you all right? I'm fine. Don't let your guard down. Watch out for reckless drivers. Yes, Sir. Uncle, do you have something in your eyes? -I think so. -It must be the wind. Shut up. Get to work. -Get to work. -Watch out. Go. Billy, there's a roadblock. Billy, let Commando drive. -You have no driver's license. -That's right. -Don't get into trouble. -That's right. If they can get me while I'm driving a Porsche, I deserve to be caught. I will run over whoever gets in my way! Hang on! Pull over! Intercept him! Pull over! Inspector Luk. Call the ambulance! Look at how Officer 33 is. -Get the Emergency Unit to seal the road. -Yes, Sir. -Brother! -Remove the bike. My leg! Paging headquarters. A serious accident occurred at the roadblock of Anti-speeding Team. An inspector is seriously injured. Assign an ambulance to the scene. Over. -Brother! -It hurts! Hang on! The ambulance is on the way. -Don't worry. You'd be fine. Calm down. -My leg hurts... Don't touch him. Uncle... You're going to be fine.. -The ambulance is here. -Pick him up... Hurry! Guys! Hurry! Come. Get him into the ambulance. Watch it! Watch it. Come. Watch it! Get him into the ambulance. Don't worry. We'll get you to the hospital. -My leg! -It'd be fine... -Don't worry, hang in there. -Don't worry. Your leg would be fine. -Lead the way for the ambulance. -Yes, Sir. Billy, are we going to report the car stolen like the last time we hit that old woman? We're doing more than that. I want it to disappear from the face of the earth. I don't care. Take care of it for me. Do you think I will leave any evidence? I know what to do. Kuang, you have to help out too. Shut up! Idiot, we have a Porsche that is worth $300 000. We'll sell you for $100 000 right now. But you have to make it disappear tonight, okay? How much can we get? You'll have $20 000. -They get busy and we get happy. -That's right. -Go back and get another car to race. -Right... Hurry! Pauline is waiting for us. The police is being played by us. Uncle, you'd be fine! Hang in there, Uncle! -It's okay. We'll be there soon. -My legs! Hurry! Out of the way! Hurry! Hurry! This is very serious. Yes, he bled a lot. I'm sorry, Officer, but I'm afraid you have to wait outside. Inspector Li, go out first. We are doing the surgery right away. Thank you. He has a massive internal hemorrhage. He's only got 10 percent chance of surviving. Get the emergency surgery ready. It didn't have to be so serious. Inspector Li. Inspector Li, how's Uncle Luk? He's in surgery. -Inspector Li, how's Uncle Luk? -He's in surgery. -How's Officer 337 -Right... We don't know yet, but it's serious. How much more O positive blood do we have here? We only have five units. I need 20 units of that blood, or the patient dies within 15 minutes. -Get all five units of the blood here. -Okay. How is it? -The doctor's out. -Doc... Inspector Li, your colleague is in grave danger. His internal hemorrhage is serious. He only has 10 percent surviving chance. The surgery will go on for three hours. But our type O blood can only last for 15 minutes. What? Inspector Li, what should we do? -Rocky, page all the guys at the area here. -Yes, Sir. -Officer 32, get the Emergency Unit here. -Yes, Sir. -Doc, we'll have the blood in five minutes. -Okay. Inspector Li, I want to donate my blood. -Get all the guys to donate their blood here. -Go, hurry! Inspector Li. Officer, we were patrolling the area. We heard from the radio that you need blood. We hurried here and see what we can do. -Bring them in. -Follow me. Hurry! Inspector Li, the Emergency Unit is here. Inspector Li, we have four teams here. What do you need? -Bring them in. -Yes, Sir. Thank you so much. Follow me. Come here and take a picture. A lot of the guys are coming. Change that blood bag immediately. He's dying. Come. Hurry over. Come. Take a picture. Go back to your position. Hurry! Hurry! Inspector Li. Inspector Chen is here. Inspector Chen. Inspector Chen. Li Chih Chieh, what are you doing? Why are there so many police officers here? They are here to save Uncle's life. Chief Commando is looking everywhere for you. He wants you to explain the shooting at the roadblock. Sir! What the hell is going on here? Sir! Why did you leave the roadblock? I sent my IP here. Not good enough. What are all these policemen doing here? I need blood. I want to see your report immediately. I am looking on it. What the hell are all these policemen doing here? -They should be on duty. -Sorry, Officer. Inspector Li, one of the guys saw 123 at the entrance of a disco. Yes, Sir. Notify the guys to keep this from the press. -Head out now! -Yes, Sir. Get on the bikes! Paging headquarters... We've reached the entrance of the disco. Over. Sir, both cars are over there. They are in there. Inspector Li. Tell Officer 25 to seal the front and back doors. Get some guys to surround them at the back. -Yes, Sir. -Inspector Li. Bring a team and go down there. -Officer four, bring a team. -Yes, Sir. -Officer 70, bring a team too. -Yes, Sir. -The rest comes with me. -Yes, Sir.... -Go in. -Go in. Out of the way! -What is it, Officer? -I am traffic Inspector Li Chih Chieh. We are making an arrest. -Don't worry. I'll take responsibility. -Come with me. Get a team to search the place. Stop the music and turn on the light! Stop the music and turn on the light! Stop the music and turn on the light! Get out! Officer, what are you doing here? We are here to make an arrest. I am Inspector Li Chih Chieh. If anything goes wrong, I'll take responsibility. Officer, you can't do that. It's fine. We will go by the book. Boss, tonight... Go away! Come here. Over there. Yes, Sir. Billy Wong, stop dancing. We need to talk to you. What is it? What is this about? You are under arrest for an assault. We are taking you back to the station for questioning. -How rude! -Officer, be nice, don't touch us. Shut up! You're coming with us too! -What do you have to arrest us? -You tried to run over a police officer. -How dare you hit me! -Go to hell! How dare you! Want to run over the police? You're dead! How dare you! Stop running! What are you doing? -Stop! -How dare you pushed me! -How dare you pushed me! -Out of the way... -Don't go after Billy. -Out of the way. -Don't hit him! -No, Officer! Out of the way! How dare you ran over my brother! Stop! Out of the way! -How dare you try to run! -Stop! Stop hitting him! -Stop! Stop hitting him! -I had nothing to do with it, Officer... What's going on now? You are under arrest for running over a roadblock and injuring police officers. Get him back to the station. Beat him up first! -Help! -Go to hell! -No, I had nothing to do with it! -Stop beating! -Go to hell! -Come with me! No! If my brother dies, you'll die too! Help! Go! I want to file a complaint. I want my lawyer. I'm going to sue all of you. Take them to the interview room. -Go that way! -Yes, Sir.... -Go! -Don't push me! Kuang, call the lawyer. Remember to shut up! Go! -Go! -I'm suing all of youl! Go! Billy! Don't let them come in here! -Yes, Sir. -Don't try to stop us. We want to go in. Let us go! We've called Attorney Chen. Get out! Shut up! -Don't worry, Billy! -Billy! You won't talk, will you? Who drove that car? I said I don't know. Really? It was you then. I don't have a driver's license. -Talk now! -I want to see a doctor. -Talk now! -I'm not feeling well. -Talk now! -I'm not feeling well. Where's the car? How would I know? Stop pretending! It must be you who drove the car! Charge me if you have enough evidence. -Stop pretending! -Enough already! Why? Do you want to hit me? I've been a cop for a long time and I've never met anyone so cruel like you! You ran over my brother, didn't you? If something happens to my brother, you'll be dead! Why won't you let us see him? We have to go in. Exactly. We've to go in. -Please cooperate. -What is it? Attorney Chen. They arrested Billy and won't let us in. -They are badly wounded. What should we do? -Calm down.... -I've notified Mr. Wong. -How... Mr. Wong, I can't handle this case. You have to! It's tough. Can you take care of it like the last time? -No. -What did you say? Why not? I have lots of money. Take care of it for me. I can't. Stop bothering me! Please. Whatever you want, I'll pay. I'll pay until you're happy. Well... I'll pay whatever's necessary. I know what to do then. What should we do? Bye-bye. Inspector Li. The three of them won't say anything. It doesn't matter. We will go ahead anyway. -Guys, calm down. -Go save them. Inspector Chen, you come back right on time. This case... This case is very troublesome. Attorney Chen... Inspector Chen, I'd like to see my client. We want to go in. Li Chih Chieh, what's wrong with you? There was a shooting at the roadblock. There was a big fuss at the hospital. And the disco too! Now at the precinct, you're doing this again. What's wrong with you? Inspector Chen, I'd like to post bail for my clients. No, your clients are not cooperating. Wait until we finish our interrogation. Inspector Chen, this won't work. We have to go through our procedure, too. -But my clients are -I am Inspector Li. -being beaten up here... -Inspector Li, I am Dr. Ho. We tried our best to save your colleague but we failed. I am so sorry. Thank you very much. Inspector Chen, if my clients die in the precinct, who is going to take the responsibility? Are you taking responsibility for my colleague's death? What? Uncle Luk... How would I know who should take the responsibility? The law requires you to produce evidence. If you have evidence, go ahead and charge whoever you want. This is my office. Get out! Get out! Sure. The Chief Commando asked what are you going to do with the shooting at the roadblock? I know. I am writing the report on the shooting. Rocky was there. I will let him handle it. Just take care of it. -Rocky, sit down. -Yes, Sir. If we want to charge them successfully, -first, find the car charging the roadblock. -Yes Sir. -Second, get their statements. -Yes, Sir. Is anyone handling Uncle's funeral? The guys are on it. If you need anything, come to me. I will. You have no evidence to prove my clients charged at the roadblock. We're still investigating. Anyway, there was only one driver, but you arrested all three of them and beat them up. You won't let them see a doctor. This is an abuse of power and unlawful violence. Is this an acceptable behavior of the law enforcement? You clients were not cooperative. They have the right to remain silent. Inspector Chen, if you want to charge them, go ahead. I want to post bail for them, because you have no right to keep them in custody for over 48 hours. Okay, bail is set at 500.000 each. They have to surrender their travel documents and report to the station every day. Inspector Chen! Sure, no problem at all. Rocky, take him out to post bail. Yes, Sir. Come with me. "NO SMOKING" Officer 25, take him to post bail. Inspector Luk! Follow him. -Are we letting them go? What's going on? -l don't want it either. -Seriously? -We are letting them go? Seriously? Inspector Chen signed it. There was nothing I could do. We are letting all three of them go? -What should we do? -After going through all that to arrest them? We are just going to let them go? -Isn't it a waste of our effort? -That's right... Those people killed Uncle Luk! I wonder what Inspector Chen was doing! -What is it? Go in first. -Darn it! What is taking so long? They are out. -Commando. -Billy, -I'm fine. -are you okay? -Does it hurt? -Get in the car first. Of course it hurts. -What is it? Help him get in the car. -Get in the car. Billy, what is it? Li Chih Chieh, let's see how tough you are. If I see you at the road, you'll know what's coming for you. Let's go! Scumbags! -Inspector Li. -Hello. This is wrong. We got them, -and now we're letting them go. -Yes. -What's going on? What a waste of time. -That's right. It's useless. Inspector Li... What is it? We were just talking about taking leave. -Something's wrong. -What is it, Officer 25? Inspector Li. His wife just delivered a baby and he wants to apply for leave. Inspector Li. Inspector Li. -What are you doing here? -I have gastric. My leg hurts. Inspector Li. What's going on with the guys? Inspector Li, do you know Inspector Chen let those people go? The guys are pissed and want to go on a strike. What are you doing? Uncle Luk is killed and my brother becomes a cripple because of him. He paid over a million -and walked out like he owned the place. -Right... -Is he above the law just because he is rich? -Right... We went through all that to arrest them and Inspector Chen just put his signature and let them go. Also, Inspector Li, all of us are being sued for beating them. They're going to take our statements. Even you are suspended. What a waste of our time and effort! What a waste... -This is wrong. -Okay... I was suspended because I opened fire at the roadblock. This is the law. You know better. As for Inspector Chen letting them post bail, it's approved by the management, because we don't have enough evidence to charge them. Inspector Li, does that mean we have to catch them red-handed? He drove over 100km per hour. -We'll lose our lives trying to stop him. -Right... This time, it was Uncle Luk. We don't know who's next. -We all have families. -That's right. If you guys go on strike, would that resolve the problem? Don't forget. You will receive disciplinary action for doing so. Is it worth risking your future for a rich scum? What are we going to do about Uncle Luk's death? I understand how you feel. But can you help Uncle that way? You should go out and get evidence, not complaining here. I may be suspended, but I'm not letting them get away. As for you, go back to your duty. Understand? Remember, there are more than one racing jerk out there. Rocky, come and see me later. You heard the man. Don't worry. Inspector Li will take care of him. -Go, get back to work. -Get back to work. You're handling this poorly. There was only one driver and you beat all three of them up. You couldn't catch them red-handed and you couldn't find the car. How are we going to charge them? His lawyer is suing us back. He claimed we abused our power and beat up his clients. The director wants me to explain to him directly. Also, this case is being handled by CID now. Tell your guys to do their job. Inspector Li, what do you need me to do? How are the guys? After your speech, they've gone back to work. But they are still upset about failing to charge the rick kids. I need you to do something for me. The rich kids have been racing illegally. They don't care if they kill anyone. They think they are above the law. Uncle died unnecessarily. I really hope we could arrest him that night, and we could have charged him for murder. We wouldn't have to listen to that lawyer. The case is being handled by CID now. Anything we do is going to be a waste of our effort, resources and our time. We don't have enough evidence now. There's nothing we can do. It's easy to get people like them. They like to race. They can't hold it in. They'll get behind the wheel soon. That'd be great. We'll set a big roadblock and wait for him. It's useless. He can run over it again. Our guys will get hurt. If he does it, I'll shoot him with a shotgun. You'd only get into trouble. If you kill him, you'd be prosecuted for murder. So we stand by and watch him get away? Even if we want to arrest them, we must have a smoking gun. Since they treat committing crimes as a game, we will go along. We can't lose to them! What should we do? Go back and gather a few guys who are good at racing. Get them to bring their private bikes. They'd be more than happy to do it. Inspector Li, how about me? Come with you big car. I don't care about my car. Inspector Li, what do you want? Save your questions for later. If something goes wrong, I'll take responsibility alone. Just do as I said. Yes, Sir. Don't worry. My leg's fine. I can do it. Trust me. -Can you hit brake with that leg? -Of course! You don't have to stake your life. We can manage without you. If your other leg got hurt, your brother will kill us. No, don't worry. Bro, I'll follow you slowly. Let me come. The bikes are ready to go. -Thank you so much. -You're welcome. -Is everyone ready? -Yes. Officer 32, is anything going on over there? Not yet. Keep watching. They will show up later. That'd be great. Inspector Li, the target is out. Look carefully who the driver is. Billy, what are we going to do if there's a roadblock? I hope it's the Anti-speeding Team. I'm going to run them over! They beat us up! You're right. If you're scared, let me drive. I'm scared? I'm ready to toss this car. It's them. Do as planned. There's a cop at the front. Today is his unlucky day. Run him over! Hey you! Pull over... This is exhilarating. The cop has to write a ton of reports now. I don't care! This is preposterous! Inspector Li, they just ran over one of our bikes. I really hope they crash into a hill! Remember, don't be rash. Go along with them. A bike is following us! They can't be keeping up with us. Is he one of us? We'll see. He's a cripple! A cripple is racing! Let's do a round, okay? Officer 4, Officer 70, the target will get to you soon. -Hurry, they are coming. -Okay. Pull over! Excuse me. Let us go first before you head out. Who do you think you are? You can't tell me what to do! -He's an idiot. -Go and intercept the car. Roger. I'm in the gang. Listen to me and nothing bad will happen to you. Billy, they are riding ahead of us. Overtake them. We're at different levels. How can we race together? Not bad. They've got skills. They did the turn pretty good. I'm not impressed though. Inspector Li, would they give up on going after the Four Heavenly Kings? If nobody races with them, they won't get a kick out of it. Let's see how long they can hold it in. Officer 32, go to the front and join them. Officer 32... After you join them, notify me right away. Inspector Li, they are behind me. Provoke them. Keep in touch. Roger. They are flaunting. You know what to do. Let's play then. We'll wait for them at the front. Go faster! Don't let them get away. Go faster! If they don't go beyond 100, they will be able to stop. They can go full speed to 160 or 170 on this road. Four Heavenly Kings, stop immediately! Keep left! Stop immediately! Keep left! Help! Call the police. Didn't you kill all the police? My leg...
