I know you're going to find this hard to believe... But everything we are going to tell you is 100% true. Just ask our dog Nuzzles. No, our dog does not talk. It's not that kind of story. It all started on the first day of my favorite time of the year... summer! I'd given up on summer being anything other than a hot nightmare full of pesky insects and wasted time. But this summer... was different. Take up the sword and once and for all, let's put the agelong question to rest. Who is the superior twin? I think you're already making that very clear. You know, you used to be fun. No! You need to grow up. Do you need help? Yeah, this is scary. I don't think it's going to hold me. You're doing a terrible job narrating. No one cares about your fear of heights. Duh! Just get to the important part. Okay. That's when it happened. There was something down there. What is it, Nuzzles? Nuzzles! Wait, we should explain there were two ways in and out of our secret hide-out. The elevator crate for Nuzzles. And the ladder for us. It's all controlled by a complex set of ropes and pulleys. Come on. It's simple mechanics. They can keep up. What was that? Bigfoot. He found my note challenging him to a foot race. Oh. That's way too small to be Bigfoot. It's a leprechaun. I'm going home. What about Nuzzles? That same day we stumbled upon our new neighbors, the Kearsts. And that's Odom. - He's the one. - Don't give it away, Z. They don't know that he's the villain yet. Oh no, I said too much. Shoot. Okay, just ignore me. Keep watching. Oh, is this a pound pup? Uh huh. My childhood dog was a rescue, too. A tiny terrier named Pebbles. Odom, say hello to our new neighbors and their dog. Oh, joy. Be polite, son. I'm sure you'll all be best of friends by the end of the summer. Hi. So nice to meet you. Oh! You might want to curb that behavior before the sheriff cites you for disturbing the peace. For barking? You know, a little trick that my dad taught me with Pebbles. Whenever it barks, you just firmly say, "Quiet!" And then you reward it with a treat. Works like a charm. I'll see you kids around. I'll take some pancakes. Oh, I'm gonna be late. Son of a biscuit! Please do not race off to work, honey. Better to be a few minutes late than in a fender bender. Oh, you're gonna bring up that again. It wasn't my fault, Emily. I drew us all as a superhero team. Hi, Mindy. What? They're offering 40%? I-- we're just a local boutique store! How do we compete with that? Sure, do 45% off everything. A few years ago, mom started a boutique knickknack store. Emily has never listened to my suggestions on how to make it successful. It's not going well. We met the new neighbors and the son is a diabolical monster. I'm sure he's nice once you get to know him. Oh, that reminds me, we should get them a bottle of wine or something. Could you pick up something inexpensive after work? I gotta work late tonight. But it's family movie night! Oh, wow. Breaking news. Don't start, young lady. How come you guys always have to work? Cause time is money and money is time no matter how much you have of one, you always want more of the other. Doug's an accountant and loves giving advice. Dad means well. But I gotta say, sometimes he doesn't make much sense. Your dad'll explain later, okay, Dax? I love you, bud. Oh, make sure to take time off for aunt Didi and uncle Fred's visit. More money. What? The answer to your riddle, Doug. Could you just be a normal daughter and call me dad? I'd take more money over more time any day. Because you know how I spell time? M-O-N-E-Y. You are too smart for your own good. Oh, I can't wait to go to Harvard and get away from you people. Would you do me a favor and not grow up so quickly, please? Listen to me, kids, the reason your dad and I work so much is not because we don't wanna be with you, okay? It's so you kids can have everything you need. Have you seen my keys? Okay. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. -Hello! -Holy! Too busy to introduce yourself to the new neighbor, huh? Sorry, man. I'm Doug Taylor. That's my wife Emily and my twins. I've already met your two kids and the dog. -Quite the barker. -Eh. Yeah, I'm William J. Kearst the third. Please don't ever call me Bill, Billy, Will, Willie or Liam. It is William. Well, it's nice to meet you, William. Yeah, actually, it's just me and my son, Odom. We just moved here from DC. Looking forward to a little peace and quiet. Uh, yeah, I would love to chat but I'm gonna be late for work. So, I'm... Oh, yeah, don't want that. You know what they say, better three hours too early than one minute too late. That's William Shakespeare, from England. Hmm. My dad's an IRS agent. Oh, now. Nobody likes a braggart, son. Kids, you know. Most important thing you can do is give them a strong moral center. No bragging. We do agree. - Put her there. - Put what there? It's a fist bump. Never mind. I'll see you around. Terrific, okay. D'ah. Even though the Kearsts seemed a little weird, we Taylors, including Nuzzles, were happy to mind our own business. But Odom seemed intent on declaring war. Clearly, our new neighbor enjoyed picking on us. And to make things even worse, we didn't even have our family movie night. Doug and Emily were worried about the store's finances. As usual. What if we sold it? What? No, we put so much money into it. - We'd never get it back. - Well, don't think about the money we'd be losing on it. Think about the time we'd be gaining without it. I'm serious. I mean, we've got the kids' college to think about. And your daughter wants to go to an Ivy League business school. I mean, how are we gonna pay for that? If we were wealthy, I wouldn't even have to do chores. Fiona doesn't have chores. This is why I'm getting a business degree. So, unlike our parentals, I can be financially secure. It doesn't bother you that they canceled our birthday this year just because they both had to work? Birthdays are just repetitive social obligations around some arbitrary day. You put too much importance on some ancient ritual of opening gifts. Just give me the cash in the card. Besides, they did promise us a belated birthday party this summer. And you got a cake. Why can't we be those cultured parents that take their kids on grand summer vacations to Europe? I want our kids to toss coins in the Fontana di Trevi. And I wanna tour Rome on a Vespa like Audrey Hepburn. And drink vino in Venice with the love of my life. Because when we opened the store, we agreed to make certain sacrifices as small business owners. I've never been in a gondola, Doug. Can we focus, please? I have to wake up early. We're running out of time. The next day, it happened again. So, we followed the sound which I suspected was created by a magical bearded fairy all dressed in green. A leprechaun if you will. Make a wish. If we're at the end of a rainbow and you just saw a leprechaun, you have to make a wish. Your friend Bigfoot tell you that? Whatever. I don't see a pot of gold anywhere. I'm done playing, Dax. I have stuff to do. Wait, where's Nuzzles? Look what I found. I've never seen that much money. Uh uh. It's beautiful. Uh huh. There's so much I could do with it. We need to find out where it came from first. Don't worry, Z, we'll get to the bottom of this. The world's greatest detective is, uh, all over it. Enola Holmes? No. Batman. We'll find out where this money came from, prove it's ours and make mom and dad happy again. And then I'm gonna build an underground Batcave -for me and Nuzzles. -Okay. But my pony gets to live in the Batcave, too. Name it Alfred and we got a deal. If you found a bunch of money under your bed, what would you do? Okay, so yeah. We bought a few things. Solving the case of the magic money could wait. Hey. You guys really like to online shop, huh? Fine and thank you. - Okay, bye. - Okay, sure. What? We burned through all of the cash in the room but then more money started to show up. All over the house. Is this some kind of a prank? What-- Where did all this money come from, Doug? I was about to ask you why there's so many shipping boxes in the recycling bin. Something's not right here. I just think we should give some of this money to a charity. Check this out, Pilots N Paws. Pilots and rescue dogs? How cool is that? We can only buy C.O.D. online. Cash on delivery. Fine. Then I'm buying Nuzzles a new water bowl. What is going on in here? Uh, we can explain. Please do. We found some money. Legally, we have done nothing wrong, Doug. The Doug thing has gotta st-- Wait, wait, did you get a new computer? What did we say about keeping secrets? At least use private browsers? What? No! Where did you hear that young lady? From you two. I, uh-- We do not keep secrets in this house. Can you use this money to help save the store, Mom? The only way to make money on that store is to expand. Once I have an MBA, I'll have tools to turn the family business around. Maybe even franchise it. Don't worry, I'll take care of you peasants when I do. Peasants? Sorry, Doug, that was a little out of pocket. Yeah. How did you know about the store? Uh, we're getting off of the point here. We have to account for all of this. Well, for now, let's just hide it in a safe place until we can figure out what to do with this situation. Our parentals tried to use the money responsibly. They even tried to make nice with the new neighbors. A bottle of sassicaia from Italy? Expensive, Doug. Very expensive. But for every dollar saved, or spent, ten more appeared! Where was it coming from? I had to solve this mystery. Really, Batman? I was the one who figured it out. Somehow... Someway... Our family dog is a real-life canine piggy bank. Wow. Our dog sheds money. Oh, Nuzzles, you're gonna make us a furry fortune! So, now we knew that Nuzzles was shedding money when he was happy. But the real question was, what would this money mean for our family's happiness? Okay, okay, listen to me. Don't buy anything. Don't spend anything. Nothing big. You hear me? Because if anybody finds out about this, we can all get pinched. Oh, okay, calm down, Di Niro. I think that what your father is trying to say is that we just-- We just can't go around buying anything and everything we want. This is where we practice restraint. Okay, just because we have this money doesn't mean we have to spend it. Yeah, we just, we gotta be careful, okay? I mean, this could pose some major legal problems. Okay, maybe we could just buy each one thing, you know. A one thing rule. That's-- That's reasonable. Yeah, just one thing, you know. So, okay, we're gonna each take like one thousand and each of you can have like a hundred each. One hundred? Adults have bigger needs. And then maybe we could get something for the whole family. Like a family vacation at the end of summer? Aw, yeah. Right. Why don't the three of you go and I'll stay here and take care of Nuzzles. It's like you don't even wanna be part of this family. Who's gonna watch the dog, Dax? You? I don't think so. Okay, we're all going. That's final. All the things you could buy, you guys pick spending more time with us? It makes no sense, people. Okay, we all have to follow the new rule. Am I clear? As ice. Is that even-- is that a saying, bud? The thing about the money was... the more we got, the more we bought. Are we online shopping, Mom? Ooh, la, la. Glitzy girls. I was just supporting another female run business on social media. You know, exchanging likes, having a presence. Just doing business. Oh, that's how we do business. Okay. Where did you get those golf clubs, Dad? Oh, these clubs? These-- Uh, these old clubs? These were a gift from your uncle Fred, way before you were born, bud. - Since when do you golf? - You know what? I never have, son. I never had the time. But I found these today and I thought I'd try something new. And you know my motto, my motto that I say all the time is never-- never be afraid to try something new. So. I've never heard you say that. Well, it is a motto to live by. Gotta go. Bye, son. It's like Mom and Dad became kids who bought whatever they wanted. I wasn't about to let Emily and Doug spend all our money. We needed to take as much as we could for ourselves before they spent it all. Something had to be done. Operation money bags was a go. Stop! Stop, hit the brakes. Hmm, out of the way. Okay, we didn't get all of it. But we got enough. To buy whatever we wanted. But there was so much money, Doug and Emily didn't even notice what we took. Bellissimali Italia. Oh, you are going to love the premiere Italian package. Its rich and exquisite art, captivating culture and astonishing architecture. Oh, and the food. Oh, my God, the food. Get yourself a personal trainer right now because you are literally going to end up eating your way through Italy. Come on in, man. All right. Wow. I just can't believe that the, uh, former heavyweight champ and Hall of Famer, Bas Rutten, is in my house. Well, my manager told me that celebrities do this kind of thing all the time. So, uh, you better believe it. - Ha, incredible. - Yeah. I have some former MMA martial arts experience myself, actually. -Oh really? -Yeah, uh, sensei Williams, summer camp '89, you know, but there's always more to learn. Exactly. And I wanna learn from the best. All right, yeah. Hmm, I don't know. I mean, this trip has always been a dream of mine, but... I'm also saving for the kids' college. I ask myself, is a trip to Italy really more important than their education? It is! Oh, my God, it is. Yeah. It is. This'll be great for us, a chance to reconnect. Family time. A little romance. Okay, just hold on. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Oh, hey, bud. This is MMA legend Bas Rutten. Hey. How are ya? He's here to teach me some MMA moves. Oh, that dog is so cute. Hey, bud, I was thinking, uh, maybe you could teach me that rear naked choke hold and then I could pop it on you real quick, huh? Yeah, that's not gonna happen. -Hey, boy. -Fair enough. I'm guessing you spent your entire life making everyone else's needs a priority. Maybe it's time you made your own needs a priority. A little advice... for once, put yourself first. Could you at least maybe say, "It's better to do too much than to do too little." Nah, I'm not gonna do that, either. Oh, okay. Look at him. Look at you. I think he likes you. Yeah? I heard that, too. You know, dogs only talk to dogs who listen, you know that, right? -Wow, you have a lot of talent. -Thanks. That animal sanctuary, that's a nice touch. Element of surprise. Oh! Oh, man, I have to fire my agent. Oh, my sister just had cards made. Give her a call. All right. Thank you. I don't normally do personal meet and greets, but honestly, you're such a big spender, like respect. So, do you want me to teach you how to do your makeup? -You're sweet, Aspen. -Oh, thank you. No, actually, I was hoping you could enlighten me on how you cultivated such a large social media following and use that to start your own business. Oh. So, let's start with monetizing likes. Okay. The spending spree was getting out of control. -Salute. -Salute! Yeah, I couldn't believe it. Between Emily's European vacation and Doug's fan boy obsessions, the parents were outspending me. It was like a bad dream. Cry me a river, build a bridge and get over it, Z. I was dealing with a real nightmare. All right, I'll give you that. But no matter how bad we thought it was, it was about to get a lot worse. What is going on out here? Oh, well, you know what they say, good fences make good neighbors. You butchered our bush. Well, now, legally speaking, half of your bush was over my property line. So. Okay, I think we can find a way to figure this out here. -Did you get our bottle of wine? -I did. That was incredibly generous, Doug. But wine or no wine-- -The law's on our side. -You can look it up. It's city code CIV-862. It clearly states that I can build a fence right here. But that's not right. Young lady, it is right. And not only is it right, but it is legal. And legal is legal. I have already told your kids about the barking. It is a direct violation of city ordinance 185B. Comfortable enjoyment of one's domicile. We'd had enough of the neighbors bullying. It was time to fight back. Time for operation defense. I will take care of the dog barking. Just clean up the sawdust. We don't want any trouble. Oh, Doug, I certainly will, because we are good upstanding neighbors. We follow the rules. Oh, oh, oh! Don't you dare. Wait, you think this is funny, Doug? It's uh-- It's a little-- it's a little funny. Oh, yeah. You know, I really shouldn't be shocked. If you can't control your dog, I don't know why I would expect you to control your children. Children, children. They mean no harm, okay? Menaces to society. I can now add aggravated assault to disturbing the peace. God, if you lived in Mister Rogers neighborhood, he would move out. Oh, oh, so, more jokes? You know what's not funny Doug? You are on my radar, sir. My radar is going ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, Doug. Huh, what's this? Oh. Throwing money around, Mister Accountant, huh? No, no, da, da, da, da, da, da. You know what they say, possession is nine tenths of the law. I guess it's ours now. Ha, ha. I really shouldn't be surprised, you accountant types are always losing money, aren't you? Or as we IRS agents call it, tax evasion. Okay maybe, you know, maybe we got off on the wrong foot here, you know. Allow me this opportunity to apologize. Oh, I don't think a simple apology is going to suffice for your family's behavior. You know, I tried. Boo hoo hoo. Did you see that, son? The Taylors just showed us their true colors. Okay, get inside you two. This is not funny anymore. That was embarrassing. He actually threatened Nuzzles and you caved and apologized, Doug? -Really? -Okay, could you lower the sass meter a few notches, please, ma'am? I won't let anything happen to you, Nuzzles. Ever. Whoa, whoa. Oh. What just happened? Tell them. Nuzzles is some kind of certified moneymaking machine. You expect us to believe our dog sheds hard cash? How could a family dog even shed money? You're not actually buying this, are you? Well, can you explain the honey? I mean, you saw it. I'm trying to wrap my head around what happened here. And frankly, it's a lot, okay? - It is a lot. - Ah. So many thoughts. Something is up with that family. I don't know what it is, but I will find out. It's really too bad. We could've been friends. Hey, I'm really looking forward to our Roman holiday. Well, maybe we could do it in a Ferrari instead of a moped? Yes. You would look mighty fine driving around Italy in that powerful racing machine. And even finer with you, my belladonna by my side. Oh. Hey, buddy. Better cancel Aunt Didi and uncle Fred's visit this year. Yeah, the last thing we want is them snooping around here. Shed daddy the money. -Shed daddy the money. -Shed the money. -Shed that money for mama. -Shed daddy the money. - Shed the money for mama. - Shed daddy some money. -What's going on here? -Oh! Hey. You guys never snuggle with Nuzzles. Yes, we do. All the time. He's our family dog, not our personal ATM. Nuzzles. It was bad enough Mom and Dad were taking advantage of Nuzzles. But I expected more from my twin sister. Z, what did you do? Consider it a late birthday gift. Let me remind you, I wasn't the only one buying stuff. At least the gifts I bought were for Nuzzles. Okay, we get it, Dax. - You're the superior twin. - Whatever. We were so distracted by all the new stuff, we didn't see danger coming. How does it look so real? I mean, it's not real, right? But it looks so real. Come on, makes more money, Nuzzles. Leave him alone. Maybe he doesn't wanna make money for you right now. Wow, really? So ungrateful. You ordered pizza? It's not like we're hurting for money. You don't even care about Nuzzles. All you care about is if he makes you money. -He's not a machine. -Don't be so dramatic. I can't believe you had pizza delivered here. Now the deliveryman knows our secret hideout. Grow up! You just wasted a perfectly good pizza. It's not even Hawaiian style. Pineapple doesn't belong on pizza. Yes, it does. Come on, Nuzzles. I just hit the jackpot. Thanks, Steve. Sounds like another doozy of a weekend. Better get those swim trunks out and stay cool. Breaking news here, reports of raining currency, an Schatowsky is on the scene.J It's true, Marvin. Money falling from the sky is creating chaos here in the park. Okay. They're hiding money next door. Ooh, look at you. See, son, I knew you had good instincts. I knew you'd make a good agent. What was your first clue? Was it all the expensive gifts, the packages, paying with cash? The dog is some kind of money machine. The whole house is one big doggy bank. That dog sheds money. People are fighting each other for it. Like wolves, they're crazy. If you're coming down, make sure you come prepared. Bring something like a bat or something, 'cause it's getting wild out here. Thanks for the tips, Jan. Again, viewers, money, hard cash, it's all falling from the sky. Seems like the park s the place to be. Right, Jan?i You can't miss out on this. Actually, I-- I need an explanation and I need it now. Okay, new rule, no one is going anywhere. This is now a family crisis. Really, Doug? What? What? What? What are Aunt Didi and Uncle Fred doing in the driveway, Doug? I cancelled. I swear. Oh, my-- What? Clean up the money. Okay, okay, okay. The couch. There's some-- It's all over! I see it, honey. Hold on. Hi! We have arrived. Oh, my Lord, what a trip. I tell you. Don't you look like you've just seen a ghost. Um, what are you doing here, Aunt Didi? What am I doing here? Well, when Dougie called and cancelled our visit, we decided we would just come anyway. Because, brother, sister, what kind of siblings cancel on their family last minute? This guy right here. Is that-- is that a unicorn? Air traffic control. I don't-- The pyramids of Giza. A pencil. It's a dunce cap. The dumb siblings do that. Shush, Freddy. Look, Emily and Doug, time is precious and it just goes so fast. You just gotta be careful how you spend it. Yes, our family visits are tradition. You don't wanna... Give it a-- give it a solid thumbs up. Milk a cow? Is that how you milk a cow, honey? -I don't know how-- -She goes to a petting zoo once and she just thinks she knows everything. Break traditions. I'm using the thumb -to break traditions. -Break tradition. Break tradition. Are ya done? Now, where's my squishy little niece and nephew? Hmm, you should have told us you uncancelled. And what, ruin the surprise? Oh, forget it, let's talk about that money. It's all over the news. It's flying through the air. It's like a free for all lottery, right honey? Uh, uh, uh, uh, I told you, we never discuss money. But it' exciting. It's-- It's once-in-a-lifetime. Hush, Buttercup. Money isn't everything. And it certainly can't buy you happiness. Um, so how long are you two planning on staying, Aunt Didi? Oh, just throw us in one of those tiny guestrooms of yours for a while and feed us some good food and you won't even know we're here. - Hmm. - We are easy-peasy. Just remember about traditions. You-- -Is that a dishrag? -Reaming it out. -In the sink. -Cleaning out the sponge. -Make sure you squeeze out-- -You are sharpening a pencil with your bare hands. I'm killing tradition. You don't wanna kill a tradition. -It's so easy. -That's dark. Just make me a scotch while I go winkle. Make me a scotch, too. And come on, this is just with the traditions and the-- oh, forget it. A couple of days? -The guestroom? -It's-- wait, I have a plan. -Move them to a hotel? -Honey, they're family. Wait, do I need to remind you that our guestroom is full of cash and our dog sheds money? Ah, yes. -Italy? -Oh, come on. Yeah, you're right. Zoey, my little buttercup. Come and give your Aunt Didi a big ol' hug. Love you, Aunt Didi. Oh, I love you, too, little one. There was still so much money laying around. Mom and Dad needed to get our aunt and uncle out of the house. Hey, how about the kids and I take you guys out for lunch, huh? Is that a yes? -You got it. -Okay, just, just-- -You got it. -Just say it. Just something for the road. It became Emily's job to hide the evidence. A mission I named, operation money transfer. No, it wasn't too expensive. I don't mind. What the hell? Oh, ho, hey! There is a coyote out in the front yard. I think we're-- I think it's gone. It's gone, yes. Oh. Well, we brought you a cream pie but Doug inhaled it. Uh, he has a knack for ruining things. Oh, well that's a shame, Doug. Okay, all set. Clean sheets. Just let me know if you need anything. Hmm. Enjoy your stay. Waiting on that scotch. That night, the neighbors tried to get their hands on our money. -Stacks of moola everywhere. -Which room? The guest bedroom. I've never been inside the house. I don't know which one's the guest bedroom. -I think it's this one. -Gimme the thing. All right. Fred, Fred, there's someone out there! There's a peeping Willie out there. Hey, hey, hey! Stop, stop, what is going on? There's a peeping Willie out there. -A weeping Pillie! -A peeping Willie? -What? -I can't stay here. We gotta pack our things, Freddy. Shameful. Just what kind of neighborhood are you raising my great niece and nephew in? We are so sorry. We feel terrible. Yeah, where will you go? Somewhere safer, Dougie. The nearest Four Seasons. Tell our little rascals we love them and we will see them later. It is time for you guys to make better life choices. You know what I always say about family. It's all about the bond. The family bond. -They got it right. Can we stay? -No! No! Where'd you put the money? The garage. Going to Fiona's. Wait, where's Aunt Didi and Uncle Fred? Where are you guys going? It's our family film night. -Not today, buddy. -But you promised. Oh, sorry, Dax. I love you. Be good, okay? Don't leave the house. And no sweets. To be clear, I do not think that this dog makes money. But to be fair, I never imagined bitcoin was gonna be a thing either. Let's get him. Yeah, let's do it. - You get it. - No, you get it. - No, you get it. - No, you get it. You get it. You're younger. You're older. That's why you get him. Let's go. Something was going on with Nuzzles. Things were getting sticky. Ha, ha, Dax. - Very funny. - Thanks, I thought so. I took up the sword and set out to save the day. Okay. Ha. Okay. Yes, hello, this is William J. Kearst the third, internal revenue agent, series 1169, grade 5/7. I'm requesting field agents for a criminal investigation. Yeah. Yes. Yes, I'll hold. Nuzzles? Nuzzles had never run off before. So, I started to wonder if he was in some kind of trouble. But who would ever do anything to Nuzzles? Just send them over to the address I submitted in my report. Do not make me pull rank, Madam. Watch this. Comply or I'll have your job. Oh, I'm on hold again. Yes, yes, hello? Hi, yeah, yes. Uh, yes, I do have evidence, lady. I have substantial evidence. I have stacks and stacks of evidence. Hello? We got disconnected. What happens now? What is wrong with you? Why can't you just be happy? We're rich. Our dog sheds money. It's the American dream. Where's Nuzzles? I lost him. And I can't find him. As long as I can remember, Nuzzles has always been there by my side. You couldn't find a better dog if you went to outer space. But now, he's gone. You can't just quit when things get tough. Help me, Dax. You're Nuzzles' only hope. Check it out, dad. It's an old video for when we were in DC. Huh. Would you look at that? Dad, I miss my friends. I miss our old life. Are we ever going back? Yes. We are? -Can I see Mom? -What? Oh, uh... Mom is off being Mom. It's not fair. Some people have everything. My son, jealousy breeds bitterness. Now, most people work for what they have. But others get everything just handed to them. But we do not take handouts, no sir. And we will not be left at. No, no, no one laughs at the Kearst family, you got me? We are a proud bunch. Be proud, my son. Sometimes in the darkest hours, we find the brightest hope. A clue! Uh, Dax, we just found candy on the ground. Yes, Z, but it's what the candy means. A little trick that my dad taught me, reward it with a treat. Treat. Treat. Treat. Treat. Odom? Odom dognapped Nuzzles. It is not about the money. No, no. It's about justice. It is about doing what is right. Someday, I wanna be an agent like you, Dad. Huh. How about I teach you some things? Did you know that we, IRS agents, we work for the American public? That's right. And our job is to foster confidence in the tax system. And we swear an oath to bring justice to those who refuse to pay their fair share. Cheaters hurt all of us. Now-- building a case against cheaters requires proof and documentation. And this camera will help us capture all the proof we need that this dog sheds money. We had to confirm a theory that the neighbors had taken Nuzzles. Which meant dangerous business, sneaking into the dragon's den. Would you like to do the honors, agent Odom? -Really? -Mm-hmm. -Okay. -Okay, get over there. Three, two, one. Shed some moola. Make money. Nothing happened. You make money for us, right now or else. Yeah, fuzzy butt. Or else. Or else what, Dad? Or else I'm gonna call the pound. You will make money right now or I will take you away from that perfect little family of yours. It was a threat, son. It was a threat. I thought that was perfectly obvious. Please get your head in the game. You know what they do at the pound to animals like you? Oh, I think you do. It'll be lights out. Your time is limited. Don't you dare talk to me like that. Show me the money. -We need a plan. -Revenge. No, an actual plan. You're the brains, not me. If it weren't for you, I'd still be stuck in the second grade. We need a distraction. Operation: retrieve the dog. Yeah, I thought the name was a bit on the nose. But we set the plan in motion. Dax, you copy? Copy, red leader. Setting the trap now. Light it up. Fire in the hole. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. That is not what happened. Someone chickened out on the pyrotechnics. Whatever. At least I came up with a plan B. Whoa! Hi! Hey. Come on. The package is secure. Operation retrieve the dog is a total success. Sheriff's Department. Look at this. I bought this thinking it might stop the shedding. What's this? It's a new collar. What is going on with you two? The neighbor tried to dognap Nuzzles. But we saved the day. So, first we saw all this candy-- --candy on the floor. Okay, okay, okay, you two. Enough with your wild imaginations. Leave the neighbor alone. -It was real. -He hates us already and he cannot know about, you know what. Mm-hmm. Hmm, what's up? - What was that? - What was what? I thought we were supposed to buy stuff, Doug. What? I-- Today seemed like a good day to break the sound barrier. You are an accountant, not a race car driver. Sweetheart, when we finally let go of what we are, we discover what we could be. What we should be is examples for our children. Mom, you're doing it, too. Yeah, who's the hottie in the bright tight T-shirt, Emily? Hm? Julio is a fitness consultant. -Julio? -Do not shame me for needing a little help. It's not fair to expect working moms to look like wonder woman on her own. We should be trying to save the store, not buying stupid stuff. Oh, sweetie, we will. It's not like we're gonna run out of money now. Okay, well we're gonna discuss this later. No, I think we should discuss this now. - No. - Don't be childish, Doug. I'm not, okay? I just don't wanna be late for my racecar lessons. Well, I am very disappointed. - Why? - You're both grounded. And take back whatever you've gotten so far, especially that hideous sweater. He was stolen! The neighbor and his diabolical son dognapped him, Mom! -I don't wanna hear it. -You have to believe us. I do not wanna hear it. You're grounded. You guys, go clean up and go hide the money. Afternoon, ma'am, Sheriff Miller. We have had a complaint, an anonymous complaint about a barking dog. Oh? There must be some mistake. Our dog doesn't bark. I didn't realize a dog barking is against the law. Well, normally ma'am, it is not but in this case, when said dog is disturbing the peace, it is an infraction that I need to investigate. May I enter the premises? Uh, uh-- -Sorry. Of course! -Yeah. -I have nothing to hide. -Okay. But it is, it is really messy. - Okay. - So, um... Ah, where are my manners? I'm-- I apologize. I didn't catch your name, ma'am. - Oh, Emily. Taylor. - Emily. Misses Taylor, sir. And these are my kids, - Dax and Zoey. - Hi there. Ah, and this must be the culprit here, huh? Oh, no, please don't put our dog, sir. - He nips when he's scared. - Nips? So, he is a barker and he is a biter. Oh, uh, I think he's just acting differently because of these changes recently. Changes? Changes. Tell me about these changes. Well, um... -They're building a fence. -Next door. And there's a lot of noise and dust and, uh, construction. - He's territorial. - Yeah. What can we do? You could, and probably should muzzle Nuzzles. Sorry, we will make sure there's no more barking. No more barking. That's all I'm asking for. Great. Oh, what is this? It's obviously your money. You believe all this, uh, this money business people are talking about? Mo-- uh, mon-- Yeah, the downtown. Have you guys heard? Everyone's talking about it. Everyone around town. It was just literally raining money, money from everywhere. Was it drug money? Was it counterfeit, stolen money? Rest assured, I made it my personal mission to get to the bottom of it. I will investigate this money mystery until we figure out, I will not sleep until I've cracked this case like an egg, like a chocolate Easter egg. So, sorry, thank you very much for your time. Uh, please, I don't wanna come back. It's such a cute dog and I hate to come back with animal control and-- Got it. We will get the barking under control. Thank you. - Okay, have a good evening. - Sir, thank you. Miller for Sheriff. Vote Miller! The heat was on. Nuzzles was a wanted dog. We had to get him to a safe house. Somewhere no one, especially the Kearsts, could find him. You know, we make a pretty good team, Dax. We do, don't we? I'm sorry I ruined your pizza party. Their deep dish is overrated. Hey, I'm starting to think it was that crazy rainbow that made all this happen. How stupid do you have to be to wish for money? I didn't even make a wish. I know. I did. I just wish I could take it all back now. We'd be better off without all the money. I just thought that if we have more money, Dad can have more time with us. And Mom could save the store. And everything could be happy again. Just like it used to be. But you'd rather be anywhere but here with us. Hey, that's not true. I don't mind hanging out with you. You make life fun. Shut up. No. You shut up. I'm coming for the dog. How did you find our secret clubhouse? By doing what I do best, following the money. Give me the dog, you preteen tick. You had no right to take our dog. Oh, I had every right. You either send that dog down now or I will have both of your parents arrested for harboring a counterfeit money-making machine. I will ruin your father's accounting practice and shut down your mom's little store. And I will-- I will destroy both of your pathetic little tiny baby lives. I can't wait to read the headline on Twitter, "the Taylor family gets caught red-handed with a butt load of illegal cash made by their pound pup which they hid in their secret wizard clubhouse out in the forest." I mean it's a lot of characters for Twitter, okay? Go workshop that. This dog is coming down one of two ways. Either peacefully or I'll take him by force. We're not giving up, Z, not ever. -Is it broken Dad? -No, it is not broken, son. It's totally broken. Dad, check it out. Odom, I am trying to figure out how they got the dog up there so that I can figure out how we can get up there. Stop bothering me. That'll work. That dog is mine. This is our chance. If we can get down in the crate, we can outrun Odom and get away. I'll buy you time. I'll make the right wish this time. And bring him home safely. I know you will. The choice was clear, be brave or lose Nuzzles. I could return to the magical rainbow and make everything right again. I just had to take the first step. Dad, I don't wanna do this anymore. Come on, Odom, whatever you do, don't let him get away. This is not fun anymore. You're so extra. This is why Mom left us. It's over, kids. (pants) You have nowhere to go. I'm sorry. I am-- I'm-- don't, don't-- So, what we got today, a family? Yeah, William called this one in. -Kearst? -Kearst. You know, I heard he got one of his own men arrested. -Is that right? -Yeah, I also heard he threw -a guy out a window. -What? Is that right? No, not the last one but he did get someone arrested so we should make this one quick. Holds more the ten thousand dollars in cash, it must be reported to the Internal Revenue Service, i.e., the IRS. And the financial crimes enforcement network or as we agents like to call it, the F-CEN. Look, you know the deal. They failed to report cash payments well over ten thousand dollars. Oh, oh, oh, ho, there is a laundry list of laws being broken. So, you're saying they have bags of counterfeit money in a secret location? And purchasing goods with intent to defraud? Ding, ding, ding. I got this, boys. Let me tell you something, Mr. and Mrs. Taylor, as a federal IRS agent, I am hereby arresting you for manufacturing counterfeit currency. And you can laugh and smirk all you want. Let me tell you something, mister man, that is a direct violation of title 5-72 of federal code. So, we are going to be placing you under arrest and confiscating the dog. I knew I'd get you, Dougie. Boo. That's him. That's the peeping Willie. Madam, my name is William. Federal agent William J. Kearst the third. Oh, you should be ashamed of yourself, sneaking around in the dark, trespassing, peeping through windows at night. Yes, I was conducting an investigation. You were doing what? Oh, oh, oh, oh, okay good, good, Sheriff, Sheriff. I want you to listen to this. And my IRS brothers, I got you. -Okay, okay-- -Mister William Kearst, you are under suspicion of trespassing which you just admitted to in all these people. And you, you know that comes with a hefty fine and possible jail time. Well, I know. I mean, I was just... I mean... Look, we are here to talk about that beast and the furry fortune that they are hiding out in the treehouse out in the woods. I'm telling you, that animal is a bona fide canine ATM. Uh, oh, okay, see? Now, when you pet the dog, wait, come back. Come back. Come back. When you pet the dog, it sheds money. Okay, all the money you saw flying around downtown? This dog, watch this. Okay, we just pet him, just pet him like this. And money. There's no money. No, no, no, no, I'm telling you, you pet him, he turns into money. It's money. Wait, please don't arrest my dad. Listen, sprinkles, you and your dad are in a lot of trouble. - Me? - Yes. I just wanted to spend time with my dad. Okay, don't do that. Don't do that. Hey. Looks like I really made a mistake this time, didn't I? - Yeah. - Well, as usual, I... seem to have taken things a little too far. And I'm sorry about that. I'm gonna-- I'm gonna figure out how to make this up to you, okay? Somehow, someway. Sir, they're not criminals. Sheriff, please listen to my son. You know, we've decided that we're not gonna press charges. -Okay. -Speak for yourself, Dougie. Sheriff, we are pressing charges. That's right. We would like to-- -Juggle? -Is that dancing? - What is that? - What are you-- -I don't know what this is. -Balance the scales -of justice, darn it. -Nobody here is pressing charges, Aunt Didi. They made some bad choices but they shouldn't go to jail. We can sort this out as neighbors. It's what neighbors do. Wow, that was powerful stuff. You are a brave young man. But you, I have my eye on you, Billy. You and your shenanigans have got to stop. Stop it. I will call your mother. All right, thank you for your time. You've confused me thoroughly. I will take my leave. Oh, by the way, I'm up for re-election this year so please vote for me. Miller for Sheriff. Everything wasn't back to the way it was. It was better. And you made me very proud, Dax. Now that the drama was over, we decided it was time to share our secret treehouse. We thought we'd make mom and dad honorary wizards. They'd earned it. So, what do you think, parentals? It's perfect. It is just magical. You know what, let's all make a family promise, that we will always work together as a team. And no more secrets. We promise. Dad? Can we donate this to charity? Yeah, please? You know, kids, as we look back on this crazy summer, let's just remember that it was that sweet little rescue pup right there that taught us unconditional love. I figured out the answer to your riddle, Dad. Oh yeah? You can use time to make money, but you can't use money to buy more time. All right. This has just been the best summer of my life. Better than a Roman holiday? Better than all of Italy. There's a famous quote that describes my summer perfectly. Family's not an important thing, it's everything. Some say the superpower of dogs is their ability to bring people closer together. - Oh, that's good. - Just ask Odom. Yeah, he turned out to be a great Wizard. And this was a great little story. Even if maybe it's not a hundred percent true. But pretty close, though. Like 89.3% true. Most importantly, it's our story. Right Nuzzles?
