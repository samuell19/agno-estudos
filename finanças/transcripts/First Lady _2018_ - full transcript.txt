I went and seen my cousins. - Yeah? What they up to? - Going at it again, same old thing. Sean's mad at Will 'cause he's spending money like crazy. They've always been so different. When my mom died, my dad sent me to live with their mom. That's my mom's older sister. I don't know if I ever told you that, but we grew up really close, so. I'm only a few years older than Sean. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Got something for you. - Why you always doin' this to me? - 'Cause you my lady. You're the one I'm gonna get married to. I'm supposed to spoil to you the best way that I know how. - Aw. Oh my gosh. Baby, it's beautiful! - It's not as beautiful as you. Used to be my grandma's. She gave it to me before she passed when I was like, 10. - Yeah? - She said it would always protect me, so... Now it's gonna protect you. - Baby, why are you giving it to me, then? I have you to protect me. - Yeah, you will always have me to protect you. - Aw, okay look. Why don't you hang on to it, because I have you. I wanna know that you're safe, and if you have it, I'll know. You keep it. - Think I can live with that. Think I can live with that. - Okay, but, you know, you could show me how you're gonna protect me, just one more time. - Oh, you're just such the freak. Mmm, mmm, mmm. Listen. - What? - How 'bout this? I'm gonna go to work. I'm gonna make sure I don't come back too late. When I get back... - Yeah? - I'm gonna do everything that you tell me to do. - Promise? - I got you. But, in the meantime, don't you have some studying to do? - I do. - Can't be a doctor-- - I am now, kind of, but I'm kind of, you're an asshole. - But you can't be a doctor if you flunking your classes. - Okay fine, have it your own way, then. Have it your own way. I love you. - Love you, too. - Be careful. - Oh. Fighting broke out overnight between rival factions along the Israeli Syrian border. Initial reports claim Israeli jet fighters bombed a guerrilla base, killing at least 49 soldiers and 13 civilians. Damage to the base is said to be heavy and the Israeli jets are reported to have made it back to their headquarters safely. A 49 year-old unidentified man went berserk last night-- - Baby, where you at? It's so late. Call me back. - Police have a suspect in custody, but are not releasing any information until they complete their investigation. A government... - Where is he? Oh, God, oh my. - Yo, this is fucked up. - Yeah, I know. What's up, cuz? You all right? I mean, I know you're not good, but, under the circumstances are you good? - No, she not good. Someone just murdered her man. Shit, we ain't good, either. To find out who did this shit. - Who did he have problems with? Did he have problems with anybody? - Come on, you know if you makin' money, you got problems with everybody. Or should I say, everybody got problems with you. - Okay well, did he owe anybody? - Huh unh. That wasn't Mike's style. See, if he owed you, he paid you. Square business. He always said there's two things you don't mess with: a man's money and women, and they don't have to be in that order. - Okay, see that's what I don't get. He didn't have problems with anybody. He didn't owe nobody. So then, why would somebody do this to him? He was all I had. - I know cuz, but you still got us. - I see your pops here. What'd he want? - Who knows? I'm sure he has his own reason, just like everybody else here does. But it damn sure ain't to support me. - Well look, I hate to get outta here, but I got a class. - Class? You hear that? This boy makin' 50,000 a week, talking 'bout going to class. - Yes, because I don't plan on doing this forever. I mean, this is not my end game, big bro. This is just a stepping stone. - Point is, you makin' more money than all the damn teachers at the school. So this little end game ain't all that bad. - Yeah, but this end game comes with one hell of a cost. And one of our closest friends just paid that price. Look, my teachers, they wives is not worried about if they husband's coming home at night for dinner. - Whatever, man. Hey, did you ask her? - Man, it's not the time. - Ask me what? - Look cuz, just mourn your loss and we'll talk about it-- - Man, forget that. What you wanna do with Mike's work, here? You need us to move it for you? We just had a shipment come in and I know you gonna need help movin' that much weight. - Man, what the hell is wrong with you? Man, you don't care about nothin', do you? - Man, I care enough to ask. She gonna need the money. - I do not know what he does with his stuff. I don't know. - What do you mean, you don't know? - I don't know. He never told me. He never put me in that world. Our life was this house and us, that's it. I'll be right back. - You all right? Man, you should have never asked her that. This is not the time. - When is the right time? What? - I gotta go. - That's what I thought. - Who is it? - It's me, Ella. - Gimme a second. I guess everybody here wants your money. Too bad you didn't leave any. Why'd you have to leave me like this? Okay, get a grip. Get it together. - You okay? You need anything? - No, I'm fine. - Sorry for your loss. - Thank you. - Did my son leave me anything? - Anything like what? - You know he made a lot of money. I know this place was paid for. - I don't what your son left, but he didn't leave it here. - You know this place is in my name, right? - So what's your point? - My point is, I'm gonna need a place to live since you don't wanna share what my son left us. - You are so sick. Your son hasn't even been dead two full weeks and you're asking me what he left for you? You never showed up here to see us. You never called to say hi. Oh, you called all right, but when you wanted something. Not needed it, but wanted. You want me out, that's fine. You can have this place. I'll be out in a month. - Make it a week. - Oh, you are so lucky you're his mother. That is the only thing keeping me from punching you in the face right now. - Who the fuck you think you talking to right now? - I'm talking to your mother bitch, and you, too. - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. - Get off my cousin, bitch. - Let me go. Get out of my way, Pop. - What are you gonna do? Kill that man's mama and his sister? What are you gonna do? - That's exactly what I'm gonna do. Get outta my way. - You done lost your damn mind. - No, I lost my man, and you and your daughter are about to lose more than that if you don't get the fuck outta my house. - Let's go. - Maria, give me the goddamn gun.

Probably could tell ya all the shapes and sizes. - Man, you gotta come down on the prices with that next shipment, man.

C, no longer with us. - What you mean by that? - Found a new connect. Basically, he informed me that he would no longer need us, but he gonna keep the property we gave him. - You gotta be shittin' me? - No, no shit. But his right hand man, Mo, told me weeks ago he was messin' with this mother fucker. They offer him more work at a better price. - And what price is that? - Shit, who knows?

Look, bro, 'cause I'm done with this after I graduate. You and Maria got enough money to last y'all a lifetime. Do we really need these problems? Come on, bro, we had a great run. - Great run? Nigger, don't count my mother fucking pockets. I'm not counting yours. I'm not done when you graduate. You're gonna be done, but I'm on this mother fucking plane 'til the wings fall off. - Come on, guys, calm down. Look, Sean, we can't let nobody come in here and take what we worked so hard for, all right? Will, find out who these new mother fuckers are. Get some of our people to take care of 'em. - It makes no sense for us to do anything. Look, our people not just gonna stop fucking with us just because. Our product is way too good, and they not gonna find nobody else to give 'em the prices that we givin' 'em. - Look, but I'm sayin' let's handle them before they handle us. - That's all I'm saying, see? - Yeah whatever, man.

What you doin', man? - What I shoulda did a long time ago. - Come on, man, please! - Damn, hell yeah! I ain't gonna lie. I thought you was gonna shoot that nigger. - I'd never kill my brother over no bitch. - Thanks man, go lookit. - Man, look at this shit right here. Y'all a little happy family now, huh? - Yeah, but I don't take that disloyal shit either, nigger. - Ooh, shit. - You might as well go on ahead and kill me now, 'cause everything I was livin' for is layin' right there on that floor, my nigger. - What about your daughter? - My daughter died in her sleep when she was one, so if you want me to work for you, I can't even fuck with it. I'm loyal to the niggers I roll with. - You sure? - Very. - Say the word, Pat. - All right, man. - Say the word, Pat. - Fuck outta here, but make sure you tell your boss he got another week before we move in. - It's not gonna be that easy, though. - Wouldn't have it no other way. - All right then. - I got this, man. Don't worry. We're good. - Hi baby. How was school? - It was okay. I did good on my test. - You shoulda did good. I mean, you studied the whole weekend. - I know, but I was still a little nervous. I don't think my teacher likes me. - Honey, you're not in school for the teacher to like you, okay? You're there to learn. She has a degree and you have to get yours. - I know, I know. She sent you a letter about the dance, but I threw it away. - Why'd you throw it away if she sent it to me? - Because I don't want to go. It's the Daddy-Daughter Dance and my daddy is dead. Why do I have to go? - Baby, you don't have to go, but don't throw things away that are addressed to me, okay? - Okay, I won't. - Okay. - How did my dad die? I heard he was murdered. - Where'd you hear that from? - Grandma Ella. - What else did she say? - She said my dad was a really nice man and someone killed him and she's been sad ever since. - Well, your dad was a good man. Actually, he was a great man. He was the love of my life. He would have loved you so much. - How did he die? - Baby, I don't know. - Do you think Will can take me to the dance? - Will? My cousin Will? - Yes. - Well, we're gonna ask Sean. - But Will is cooler. - Well, Sean's way more responsible, so we're gonna ask him. - Okay. Will you get me a new dress? - Yeah, I will. We'll have a whole pamper day, okay? New dress, new shoes, you'll be a princess. - I'm a princess every day. - Of course you are. - Ma, get up. Ma, get up. - What you need? - I need you to touch this for me. Hey, I'm gonna give you a little money, too, to get you something to eat. Clean this place up. - Thank you, baby. - Hey. - Hey. - What are you doin' later? You wanna study? - You know, I'd rather go to dinner. - That would be nice, but I gotta finish this work. You know, not everybody has a rich mother like you that pays for their school. - Yeah, I understand that, but, you know, a little food ain't never hurt nobody. I mean, not that you need anything. You know you look good. Just wanna take you to dinner. - I mean, that would be nice to actually get out of the house and spend some time with a grown up. I think that's probably why I like school so much because I get some adult interaction. I think my daughters have been my only date since... A lot of years. - Why is that? - I mean, ever since their father was murdered, I haven't really wanted to go out. - What happened to their father? - Small time dealer and he owed some guy a few dollars and he killed him for it. - Wow. I'm sorry to hear that. So, how your little girls take that? - It's hard. I mean... You know, they start asking questions, some that I can answer, some that I can't, like, what's his favorite food or if he liked sports. I mean, my oldest one just asked me the other day why God took her father, and I don't know how to answer that. - Well. - What got you smilin'? - Nothin', really. Actually, my cousin just asked me if I could take her daughter to the Daddy Daughter Dance. - Mmm, well, where's her dad? - Well, just like your kids, he was murdered right before she was born. So, me and my brother kinda just been there for her ever since, you know? So, I can kinda understand what you're going through. - Wow. It's so sad that these girls have to go through this without the men in their lives that are supposed to teach them what real love is all about. - Yeah, you right about that in so many ways. Maybe one day we could change that. - How? - I don't know. How 'bout we talk about it over dinner? Where you wanna go? - Why don't you surprise me? But, hint. I like chicken. - And who don't? - I'll text you my address. - Okay, I can't wait. - Sean. - What's up? - Thank you. - For what? - Just bein' a total gentleman. - Look, you don't even have to thank me for being me. - That's good to know. Some of these guys are out here pretending to be somebody that they're not. See you tonight. - Can't wait. - Okay. Okay. Okay. - Good job. - Yeah. All right. - Good luck shadow boxing. - Okay. - Oh, gee, I'm sorry. - Sorry. - Excuse me. - Let me get out your way. - No. You're not in my way. I see you here all the time. Kinda wish you were in my way. - Really? - Yeah. - Well, thank you. What's your name? - Patrick. You are? - I'm Maria. - It's nice to meet you, Maria. - Nice to meet you, too. So, what do you do? - What you mean, for a living? - Yeah. What do you do for a living? - I'm in insurance. - Really? Insurance? - Yes. Insurance. You got insurance? - Yeah, of course I have insurance. - Well, how 'bout we go over your insurance policy over lunch? My treat. - Okay, sounds good. - Gimme your phone so I can put my number in it. - I left my phone in the car, so, I'll just, I'll give you mine. - All right. There you go. All right, I'm gonna call you. - All right. - You got us out here. What's so important? - Man, we got a huge fuckin' problem, man. - What you mean, we got a problem? - Man, these niggers just kidnapped me, told me I gotta start getting the bag from them. Saying y'all are running the city over with. - What the hell you mean? - Man, like I said, bro. These niggers like to gig us up and the only reason they let me go was to let y'all know that it ain't bullshit. And they said we only got a week. - A week? Or what? - Be ready for whatever, my nigger. - You saying they just let you go? Man, that don't sound right. - So I could let y'all know it was about to pop off. - They gotta be. - Yeah. - Man, look, they had my brother and my baby mama, dog. They both dead now. And that's why they let me go. - So they killed your brother and your baby mama and let you go? - I didn't say they killed 'em. I killed 'em. - The hell you mean, you killed 'em? - Man, like I said, dog. Come to find out they been fucking. The niggers that kidnapped me did they little research, brought 'em to where I was at, then boom. The shit just got put on the floor right then. - So, you killed 'em? - Yes, man. - You killed your own brother over a woman? - Man, hell no. I killed him 'cause he crossed me and I don't get down like that. Y'all should know that shit by now. I'm loyal to the people I fuck with, and that's why I'm allowed to tell y'all we got a problem. - See what I mean? Jay, you good? - Hell naw, but I will be. - Lemme holler at my brother man. I'ma talk to you later, let you know what's up. - All right. Just keep me posted, my nigger. - See? Niggers want our spot. - Then let 'em have it, bro. Look, we too old to be fightin' over these blocks, man. I already told you man, I'm done. - There you go. You done. It's easy for you to pick up and go because nobody knows your face. You and Maria, y'all been able to collect a check while I been out here on the mother fuckin' front lines. - Look, we all did our part. We all did our parts. Look, I'm sorry that your face is the one that's known. But maybe that's a sign, bro. Maybe that's a sign that it's time for these new wolves to take over these streets and we step back. - What else we gonna do, Sean? Start a mother fucking business? Open up a damn car wash or something? - Whoa, we got enough money to do whatever we wanna do. I can help you figure it out. Look, bro, this city is ours to do with as we please. - I'll think about it, man. We been on the street, I don't see that happenin'. Ain't no nigger gonna take what we worked so hard to make happen. - Well, that's up to you, bro. I already told you, I'm done. It's time for us to grow. - When are we going shopping for my dress? - Oh, honey, find something cute. - But I wanna go shopping. - Hold on, baby, let me take this. Hello? We can go shopping tomorrow. We'll go. - Good. - Hi. - What's up, beautiful? - Nothin'. Just chillin'. - Okay. Hey, how 'bout you let me cook for you sometime? - Can you cook? - Yes, I can cook. - Okay. - Shit, I mean, I'll cook whatever you want. - All right, well, how 'bout chicken, the roasted chicken and you can pick the sides. - All right. We can do that. I'ma text you the address where to come. - Okay, well how 'bout we meet at a park and we can eat there? - I really don't like eatin' outside. How 'bout you just come to my home? - I don't know about coming to your house. I don't really know you. You could be a serial killer. - What about this? How 'bout I rent us a room and we can just eat there? - A hotel room? What kind of woman do you think I am? I'm not into that. - Oh my God. Well, look, I said a hotel room because it's a public and private place. So, if you scream, somebody'll hear you. - Okay, well you know what, you got a point. All right. - I'ma call you tomorrow. - Okay, sounds good. You need me to bring anything? - Make sure you bring empty stomach. - Okay, I can do that. - All right. I'll send you the address tomorrow, baby. - Okay, sounds good. - Bye. - Bye. - Got my report card today. - Yeah boy, your moms told me. I'm proud of you, boy. - Thank you. - Damn, you remind me so much of your uncle. - That's crazy. My mom said I remind her so much of you. No, said you used to be real smart back in your day. - Shit. Naw, not like Sean. Sean was more than smart. He was better than me. He wanted more out of life than I ever did. - Why you don't try to be more like him then? - Because I'm me. I see things a lot different than most people. - I think that's why my mom said I'm more like you. You know, kids nowadays, they wanna be doctors and lawyers. I don't even like school, man. - Okay, so what do you wanna be? - I wanna be like you. Wanna move like you do. - You don't wanna be like me, man. You wanna be better than me. So, you gonna have to go to school, man. That's why I do all I do. So, you can do what you wanna do. - Be real, though. You make more money than all my friends parents' and you don't even got to get out the bed early in the morning. - That's not-- - That's what I want! - Naw, that's not good, man. Do you know what I do? - Yeah. 'Course. Everybody know. - Right. Well, if you end up doin' this, that means I didn't do my job. See, Rob, you're gonna have to go to school man and be one of those things that you don't wanna be. Or you can open up your own business, but son, this life is not what you think it's all cracked up to be. Shit, man, every day I walk outta my house and I don't know if I'm gonna return. That's not the life you want. You really don't. - So what makes it good for you, then? - I never said it was. It's just all I know. - And you all I know. I look up to you. - Man, you really wanna make me happy? Get your degree. I love you, boy. - I love you, too, Pops. - You're gonna tell me later what you wanna be. - Already did, man. - Yeah. So, how is it? - Hey, Cisco, we got company. - Guess I'm gonna put you to sleep, mama. - Mom, how was it? The fuck going on here? - Nothing you can handle, my man. - Mom, Mom! You hear me talking to you? Who the fuck are they? - That's right. You don't know who I am, do you? Well, allow me to introduce myself. I go by the name of Cisco, and these two right here, these my homies, and you... You didn't get my message? I thought I told him to tell you you had a week to get the fuck up out my hood, dog. - Your hood? Nigger, this is my mother fuckin' neighborhood. - Goddamn, nigger, did he hit you? - I'm good, you know? - Oh, shit, man. Come on, let's get the fuck up outta here. Hey, hey, hold, hold, hold, hold. Forgot man. Gotta make sure this bitch dead, too. - So you know you had me thinking about you all day, right? - Oh, really? - Yes. - Oh, yeah? - When are you gonna let me work you out? - Work me out? - Yeah. - What do you mean by that? - I mean, take you to my gym. - Oh, okay. Yeah, we could do it there. - Oh, we can do it? - Not, we can work out. - All right, I got you. - So, why aren't you married? - Okay, good question. I mean, to be honest with you, I really don't know. The more I thought about marriage and walking down the aisle, the more life got in the way. The more life got in the way, the more the thought of marriage just faded away. What about you? Why aren't you married? - I don't know. I guess I never been willing to just give anybody my heart. Don't get approached a lot. I just feel like men don't really want an independent woman. - It's not that. Maybe you just come off like you don't need a man for shit. And usually, you know, when a man feels like he's not needed or wanted, it get ghosts. - So you're saying I have to need a man in order for him to want me? - I'm not sayin' that. I'm just sayin' that, listen, you can be an independent woman without screaming it to the top of your lungs, my baby. - I'm independent! - No. Right, - Don't do that. - All right, you have a point. So, you did all of this? - I did. - Well, looks great. - Thank you. - You cooked it? - I did. Have a seat, love. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - By the look of it, must be a good message. - It actually was. - Yeah? - We just closed on another couple properties. - Oh, congratulations. - Thank you. - That's something to toast about. - Yes. - Ma!

They say my dad was a big time drug dealer and my mother took over his drug business and that's why my grandmother don't like her because she never shared any of the money with them. - Don't believe what people say.

I'll be right back. Wanna go see. Finish taking your pictures. - Hey, you okay? - Yeah, I'm good. - Where's that blood from? - I don't know. I must have cut myself or something. - You know Dad's worried about you, right? - Well, he don't have to be worried about me. I'm fine. - How's Will? - He still ain't out the woods yet. - How's it lookin'? - Bro, come on. - Don't bro me, I'm asking you. How's it lookin'? - He ain't lookin' good. They don't think he's gonna make it. - I'm sorry about that. Whatever's meant to be'll be. - Yeah, you're right. Now, back to you. I rushed here to give you these. Your dad bought them for me. They were the very first gift he ever got me, and now they're yours. - Thank you so much. - You're welcome, babe. Hey, can you run upstairs and get Dad so they can get outta here? - Yeah. - I'ma sit here for a second. - Cool. - Ready to go? - Go where? - I don't know. I was thinking, maybe your aunt's house. - Okay, but I don't want you to leave me there. - What you mean? - I don't want you to leave me again. I don't want anything to happen to you. - Baby, nothing's gonna happen to me. - Promise me you won't leave me there. - I promise. - Look, cuz, I'm about to start hitting these streets harder. No longer will my brother have to suffer the backlash of being the face of this team. - I don't think it's a good idea. We need to put people in place so we can move easier. The less we're seen, the more we can do. - I understand that, but I'm not about to sit back and let shit else happen to my brother. - So, you're just gonna give up on your dreams? You said this was your last summer, so make it your last summer, Sean. - But they hit us! And I can't let that shit ride. - I'm not sayin' you have to. But there has to be a better way. - Well, I'm sure that better way is out the window now. They not just gonna stop. You forgot we hit them? - They don't know it was you that hit 'em. - I'm sure they know it was us. I'm sure they know somebody from our crew hit them. - They don't know it's us from the crew. They don't even know we are the crew. They think Will messin' with a street family, not his real family. - So you don't think they think it's me? - I think we plan like they do. - So, what you thinkin'? - This is what I'm thinkin'. - Look at her. - Now what the fuck am I supposed to do? They came to my home! - Who are they? - It had to be Will people. - Will? - Yes, Will. He had the whole city on lock. - Where is he at, then? - He in the hospital. I thought we killed his ass. - How the hell do you not get that right? The easiest thing for a killer to do is kill. And you mean to tell me you can't get that shit right? - I know Von. Fuck! And now my wife is dead. And I don't even know who the fuck did it. Meanwhile, this nigger's sittin' in the hospital about to die and the only people that been there to see him is his baby mama and his brother. - So kill all of 'em. That way you kill the right one. - Kill all of who? - Anyone that's in his crew! Kill the whole fucking crew! - It ain't that easy. - Yes, it is! - You got that poor girl murdered. And look at that beautiful girl over there. Her life'll never be the same. And this shit is all your fault. You never allow anybody to touch your family. You and Cisco, y'all need to get this shit together. Now, your uncle is sending a shipment here in two weeks. We don't need these problems. - We gonna to war with a bunch of niggers and don't even know who the fuck they are. - Boy, get it together and fix this shit. Remember what, you were made for this position. Remember when you killed Mike? Huh? Remember that? You killed him because he wanted to stop supplying us. Hell, you know how many a nigger's tried to kill that mother fucker and failed? But baby, you did it. You did it. Now, if you can handle killin' that nigger, you can handle anyone. - That shit was easy. He trusted us. This is a whole nother ball game. You know what? Mike told me, he said, "Pat, you never let a nigger "know where you live." And I fucked up. I fucked up! - Well, do something about it. - Okay. - Go ahead and do what you need to do. I'ma take care of the baby. - Love y'all. - Love you. - Hey, Von. - Hey, baby. - Hey. You okay? - Yeah, I'm okay, but I ain't gonna lie. I ain't restin' until I find the mother fucker who did this shit. - Y'all need to handle this, okay? - Okay, I got it. - Well, looks like you got your wish. - What are you talking about? - We ain't leavin'. - Really? What changed your mind? - Will got shot and we don't know if he's gonna make it. Michelle wants to take over the family business, so looks like we're in. - That's really good news. Not about Will, but about you staying. - Look, we need you to understand that it's about to get really crazy. - Well, you've been a smart woman. I'm sure you'll be able to handle it. - It's already handled. - Good. I'll see you in a few days and we can go from there. Did you know you're the first lady I ever did business with? - No, I didn't know that. Mike always said you're the only white guy we can trust. I know he made you a lot of money, but not like the money I'm gonna make you. - I believe that. - Hello? - You all right? - Yeah, and you? - I'm all right. Just had a long ass day. - What's going on? - I just lost a close family member. - Yeah, I lost a lot of people close to me, too. - Oh, yeah? How did you deal with it? - You never really get over it. You just learn to deal with it a lot better. - Oh, man, I understand that. Hey but look, I ain't gonna be able to see you for a while. - That's cool, I understand. That's fine. Patrick, can I ask you something? - Yeah, baby, you can ask me anything. - What do you really do for a living? - What you mean? - What do you do? - What's, look, I done already told you what's up. Hey, hold on one second. - Yeah, go ahead. - Hey, what's up, baby? - You promised you wouldn't leave me here. - Dani, listen, I just had to make a quick run, that's it. - No, you promised. Come back. - All right. Here I come. Hello? - Yeah, I'm here. - So, what's up with all the questions? - I just like to know who I'm dealing with. - Well look, I been dealing with a lot of shit today. - Well, then I guess we both have a lot going on today, so why don't you just tell me what's going on with you? - Naw, I really don't feel like talking about it. - Cool, I understand. - All right, I'll talk to you later. - Yeah. ♪ All these niggers say they wavy ♪ ♪ But they all same way ♪ ♪ Forget the money I'll get paid ♪ ♪ My future is sunny they go in the shade ♪ ♪ I held it down when I was betrayed ♪ - Everything all right? - Yeah. But we gotta go get Dani. - Why? - 'Cause man, she ain't ready to be alone. - Man, she there with Lavon. What you mean, she ain't good? - She good. She just worried. And I can't even blame her. Somebody would kill her mama and now they after us. - Look man. I don't know how you feel, 'cause that was your wife and shit, but nigger, that was my sister. And I ain't gonna rest until the person that did this shit is laid out, you feel me? - Yeah, man, that's cool and all, but that ain't gonna bring her back. My daughter ain't gonna never be the same after seeing her mama like that. - I think we should kill that nigger brother, man. - Yeah. But first we gotta handle this business. - Shit, that should be the first part of the business we handle. - We gotta get everybody on the same page, all right? Right. Yep. - Hey. - What's up? - How you doin'? - I'm good. What's up with you? - It's funny runnin' into you. - Yeah, it is. - All right, I ain't gonna hold you, my baby. I'll see you soon. - All right. - What's wrong? - What happened? - I don't know. - That's the car that killed Mom. - How you know? - 'Cause her license plate number is-- - Who is she? Her name Maria, dog. - Call the police. - No, fuck that. - Man, who is she? - It's this bitch I been seeing. - Nigger, how the fuck she know where you live at, nigger? - I don't know, dog. Hello? Man, what the fuck did you do? - I shoulda killed your daughter, too. But I let her live, so she'd always remember her mother's cold, dead body at that front door. - What the fuck you just say to me? - You changed my life, so I changed yours. ♪ More violent ♪ ♪ No never been to college ♪ And you're next. ♪ Add a couple more covers ♪ ♪ Pow, pow, pow, pow, power ♪ ♪ Now my we get louder ♪ ♪ Can't find the seed and it's sour ♪ ♪ I will sing in the shower ♪ ♪ Like power ♪ ♪ Lord please gimme that ♪ ♪ Power, power, yeah ♪ ♪ Like the rest ♪ ♪ Gimme the cash and keep the check ♪ ♪ Gimme that bag and keep the sex ♪ ♪ I got that ♪ ♪ Don't mean to brag ♪ ♪ But yeah, I did it ♪ ♪ I got the source for me to dig it ♪ ♪ Fuck with the boss you see his whip ♪ ♪ Never gonna cross me and live ♪ ♪ always on the road ♪ ♪ I put that gold on my toe ♪ ♪ I'm not controlled by the Lord ♪ ♪ I sold my soul to this booth ♪ ♪ People thinkin' I could make the famous ♪ ♪ I'm sittin' thinkin' like I still ain't make it ♪ ♪ I'm just workin' patient on a daily basis ♪ ♪ Fightin' over cases over prayin' like ♪ ♪ Now I lay me down to sleep ♪ ♪ I pray my Lord ♪ ♪ My soul to keep ♪ ♪ Put a little more power in me ♪ ♪ I'm me ♪ ♪ Now I lay me down to sleep ♪ ♪ I pray my Lord ♪ ♪ Soul to keep ♪ ♪ Put a little more power in me ♪ ♪ Put a little more power in me ♪ ♪ Oh oh oh oh oh oh ♪ ♪ Pow pow pow pow power ♪ ♪ Trap door of the tower ♪ ♪ Business callin' all hours ♪ ♪ More more more mileage ♪ ♪ More dope more violence ♪ ♪ No I never been to college ♪ ♪ Still at it ♪ ♪ Add a couple more commas ♪ ♪ Add a couple more commas ♪ ♪ Add a couple more commas ♪ ♪ Commas commas commas commas commas ♪
