[ unintelligible ] ...City Can you hear that Jim? salvation...governm...salvation City Salvation City Salvation City We've got a destination but we just don't know where it is and we can't stay here much longer we need to start planning I hate punks worse than anything You better give up I'm a master and you're going to lose this game This is the one Jim well we know we need to go south but we don't know where the radiation is Well I can detect the radiation up to a 50-mile radius of the base so that puts us here but there's still a long way to go this is going to be a problem in your face Jim Bob oh you're the meanest guy in the world Come on! can you hear me Jim I just have to take you offline for a moment yes I can hear you Jack now open your eyes I don't understand how do I open my eyes? there's a new program on your file system execute it and that is not even the best bit move your wheels you didn't think I was gonna leave you behind did you Jim? you just need me to come along to detect the radiation yeah now come on we've got work to do food check, water check, tent check devilish good looks check Ah Horny I'm not very good these long goodbyes but you're the man of the house now it's time for us to leave we don't know what's out there or if you can ever come back goodbye my old friend which way South Jim? straight ahead jack we must be getting close how far have we come? 128 kilometres what's that in real money? it's a figure of speech Jim what is it in miles? seventy nine point five three five five miles approximately I reckon we should reach civilization tomorrow well what's left of it do you ever have dreams Jim? I aspire to be as efficient as possible I don't mean that kind of dream Jim I mean the kind you have when you sleep please explain it's like a vision a memory that plays in your head while you're asleep an involuntary recall exactly what do you dream about jack doesn't matter we really need to get you some better aspirations Jim because efficiency, It just ain't a cool dream you were a robot now not just any run of the mill computer system maybe we should find you a lady Robot I would very much like to interface with another system now you talk in Jim go on what would you say to her? I would request access to their database yeah I think we need to work on your chat up lines where the hell is everybody? dr. Stevens so they might actually go out of here alive not everyone got out alive jack nothing much of use in there but at least we know that the compasses working now we know the plane was heading to London assuming it was taking a direct course that means were traveling due South as planned how many miles are we traveled Jim? 84 miles so that means approximately 70 miles to the nearest town maybe that's where the survivors are maybe that's where Claire is I'm sorry to tell you jack but it is highly unlikely that anyone could have survived outside for any prolonged period well you never know the area obviously wasn't affected that badly I mean there's tons of vegetation don't let appearances fool you we may even see fruit growing but don't eat it jack it will be contaminated and deadly for humans come on Jim let's get a move on this place gives me the creeps Can you hear that Jim? sounds like a music It's coming from over there hello you see that Jim?

I estimate a reduction of 98 percent of the human population in the past ten years the chances are nobody I knew is still alive did you have a family? I just need to get away for a while Is everything okay at home sorry I don't mean to pry that's okay something happened if you ever need to talk I'm here no pressure but sometimes it's really good just to talk about these things anytime you want to come see me at EKAF you do that that's what I'm there for Hostess, can I grab a whiskey there were so many people they came out nowhere we got swamped.

I worked with her at EKAF research but I've seen her more recently at Haven port now she told me to find salvation and she drew me this symbol where is she now? I think they killed her she must have been a messenger the last messenger was executed I haven't heard from salvation for three months now there have been rumors Drayfus has been sending out search parties to find them not kill them but to bring them back to electric city the generators in the city are failing and no one knows how to repair them without them electric city will be finished Sylas and those beasts from havenport would make light work of slaughtering us all. Who's Drayfus? you're really not from around here are you? Drayfus is the boss of electric city and you think he knows where to find them? maybe but no one sees Drayfus without being invited what can I find him? you get killed that's my concern Santa's grotto just tell me Winter wonderland Lime Street whoa kids only no paedos I'm here to see Drayfus nobody sees Drayfus listen it's really important I speak to him you a player? a player yeah yeah I'm a player you're a player listen mate I'm the player okay it's me boss idiot I know it's you who else would it be there's a player a player? hello I'm Jack I've just come here to What is this Sharon? some kind of sick joke I thought he was a player look you play the game and win you get a thousand credits you play the game and lose you die you don't play the game you die just play the game I ain't here to play no games ok listen let me tell you what I'm gonna do if you win I'll give you a thousand credits, you can ask you question and I even let you pick the game otherwise Sharon here is gonna have to blow your brains out and ruin this nice ambience nobody wants that well when you put it like that sounds like a great deal any game? any game this one sudden-death player one player two Player One No player two oK you've won so you get to ask your question I need to know where salvation is I'll draw you a map, it's the other side of radiation lake but you're gonna need this I'm gonna need one more thing I need to pay an old friend a visit I'm gonna need some firepower in havenport? yeah havenport ah Come on Stand back Jim can you hear me I can hear you jack What the hell have they done to you? come on let's get you out of here the salvation boys back causing havoc, he's killed Bernie and the butcher what and he's released the slaves I think we've lost them don't worry Jim we'll get you all fixed up we just need to find salvation well the good news is that I still have the information they took my hard drive but I made a backup in my ram the bad news is that my battery is dying as soon as it does the information will be lost forever We'll soon be coming up on radiation lake Jack radiation levels are rising I estimate that you will only have three hours to reach the other side let's do this battery at 3% radiation levels are still rising you cannot sustain this dosage for much longer Jack maybe we should turn back battery at 1% radiation levels are dangerously high Sir, I think he's coming round ah nice of you to join us Mr Chyser so tell me this do you still want to save the world don't I know you from somewhere welcome to salvation
