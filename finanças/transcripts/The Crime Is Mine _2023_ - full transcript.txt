THE CRIME IS MINE Miss Pauline, open up! I'm naked, Mr. Pistole! And Madeleine's not here! You owe me 3,000F for 5 months' back rent! Pay me or I'll break down the door! I'll break it down... - Here I come! - Come in. That's more like it. I can explain. I came for money, not explanations. Please sit down. Do you have an automobile? A little Citroën. Some renters do pay me! Ever left it in the garage for 2 months? Yes, when I broke my leg. - Poor man! Which leg? - This one. - Changing the subject? - No. Did you pay the car tax during that time? No, I wasn't using the car. We didn't use your flat in July or August. Madeleine and I were away. The flat was empty. "In the garage!" We can subtract 1,200F. - No way! - What? I know you're a good man. I like you a lot. Give us time to pay the 1,000F we do owe! - 3,000F! - I'm speaking to your heart... My heart's not listening! Save your pleas for the court, young lawyer! I'm unmoved. But yes, I am a good man. I'll expulse you quickly, to spare you further rent. Wait! Know where Madeleine is now? No, I don't care. She's with Montferrand! What's Montferrand? You landlords know nothing! Only the biggest theater producer in Europe! He wants Madeleine for his new play, Suzette's Ordeal. When were you admitted to the Bar? A year ago. And you've never pled a case? I plead constantly. I just did. Listen, I'll give you 48 hours. If I you don't pay me by Monday... Madeleine! Expecting money again? Expecting me to give it to you? We sure need it. - No luck? - No. I'll have to report you to the police. Men are disgusting. Pigs! Go right ahead and insult me! She's a bit upset, Mr. Pistole. And I'm exasperated! 4 times I ask for the rent, 4 times you play me for a fool! - He didn't offer you a part. - He did, the maid. 10,000F a month. 10,000F? So why the long face? Take a guess. He liked me so much, he wants me for an hour twice a week. - At the theater? - No, dummy! At his bachelor apartment, Avenue Frochot. I get it. 10,000 a month for 2 hours a week is 1,000F an hour! Sorry, but I didn't calculate. In any case, I refused. And when I got up to leave... What? He jumped on me, got me in his grip, and kissed me. - I screamed, we struggled. - My god. He threw me on the sofa. I bit him. He howled. His eyes were wild. He seemed amused. And excited. I ran out of there as fast as I could. My poor Madeleine. What a story. Took you a while to get home. I walked. I needed to breathe, and think. I'm so disgusted, discouraged! I thought I'd finally get a real role in a good play! More importantly, you refused to be that bastard's mistress. You didn't get a role, but... you have a sweetheart to console you. You're right, I have André. He's so different. He'd never try to make me his mistress. That's a worry. You really think he'll marry you? He should help us pay rent. He's broke! The son of Bonnard Tires? His rich father is stingy. He could work. Work bores him. Who cares, if I earn money? - He'll pay when his dad dies. - Is he dying? Not really. Those rich sons! Everyone else works. They sit on their behinds. Pauline. We met André together. He fell in love with me. It's petty to hold a grudge. Doesn't matter who I'm with. No one prefers me. You exaggerate. Some women are born to love, others to listen. I'm a listener. The eternal confidante. Like in a tragic play. - André! - My little Madeleine. Come in. Pauline is here. Don't worry, she's leaving! Hello. - Am I chasing you away? - No, I'm busy. With what? Boutrin, the shady businessman downstairs. He's in trouble and needs a lawyer. Careful, he may have a sofa. Don't worry. I can bite, too. Follow me, have no fear. What's this about biting and a sofa? None of your concern, fortunately. Madeleine, I feel like a schoolboy with you. I long to make you happy. Your feelings make me the happiest woman on earth. But I want more for you. What more is there? Luxury, comfort, the high life! When I ring, you open the door. Nice to see you first, but still. I need no butler to love you. Maybe later, when we're rich. And we will be rich! Is your father dead? What? No! The poor man. Sorry. He'll live 100 years. We have to make our money another way. Another way? Robbery? Blackmail? Counterfeiting? Your imagination is on fire! It's worse than you think. I'm 400,000F in debt. What Dad gives me, I lose at the races! - Life is impossible. - Impossible! Now that I love you, I'm struggling to control my desires. Don't hold back. My heart wants you, but I must hold back. But why? I can't drag you into my mess. I can't take on a woman if I can't support her. Excuse me, but have you ever considered working? What? Bonnard Tires? A lifetime of tires! May they all go flat! - There's more to life than tires! - Sure. But I have only one vocation. Loving you. That's not very lucrative. Which is why I see just one solution. What? A good marriage. What? With a certain Berthe Courteil. Her dowry is 5 million. My father approves. He'll pay off my debts and match her million! So? Invite me, while you're at it! What difference does it make, if you're the one I love? I won't make you take a rich lover, I'll make the sacrifice! Here's my fiancée. I mean, the one I might marry. You already have her photo? Yes, to reassure you. Look at her, then yourself. How could I love that? Poor woman. A 3-week honeymoon, or less. Maybe 2. Then we'll organize our new existence. "Our new existence"? As soon as possible, you'll move to Passy. "Passy"? The Courteils own a building there. - "The Courteils"? - My future in-laws! They're giving us the 5th floor. No rent! We'll be near each other, share at least one meal a day. - A dream life! - "A dream life"? I'll finally be able to love you with no misgivings. - What are you doing tonight? - Nothing special. I'm dining with the Courteils, then I want to see you. To forget the sacrifice I'm making for you, my darling. - No kiss? - I'd hate to make you late. Right, my god! I'll be here by 9:30, ok? - See you later? - See you later. I adore you. See you later, Miss Pauline. André was glowing just now. He's marrying 5 million francs. I'll be his mistress. What? André is a big lout! You were right. I'm a fool to love him. - I feel like ending it all! - You're crazy. I feel like I'm waiting for a train that will never leave. I've been miserable for 24 years. My career's going nowhere! Patience has limits. "Patience is an art that requires patience." You should want to end it, too. I don't have your reasons. Not my reasons? - Did you see Boutrin? - They're arresting him. I'm the 14th lawyer to offer my services. See? And your love life? - A desert. - And you still want to live? - I'd like to try a bit longer. - Wake up. I'm a bad actress, you're a bad lawyer. No one loves us. We're broke, we owe 5 back rents. We'll be on the streets. Madeleine! What are you doing? Let's be sensible and kill ourselves. Enough of this. It's a beautiful day. I have sandwiches. - What kind? - Ham and butter. You prefer suicide? You're too despotic. Sorry, Pauline. I'm just so sad. "Gas, electricity, final warning..." - Hello. - Hello, Miss. Are you Madeleine Verdier? - No, she is. - What do we owe you? I'm not a debt collector, Miss. Mr. Brun, French National Police. Miss, did you have a meeting today at 2 at Mr. Montferrand's home in Neuilly? Yes. Did you meet with Montferrand himself? Yes, why? He's dead. He died between 3 and 3:15. Montferrand is dead? You didn't know? - Why would I? - How'd he die? Consumption, I bet. Why? He's hot-headed, excitable. You knew him well? I saw him twice, that was enough. Montferrand may have had consumption, but he also had a bullet in his skull. - He deserved that bullet. - Madeleine! You hated him that much? Not at all. She's just a bit upset. Montferrand promised her a role but didn't keep his word. That's all. The victim's wallet also disappeared. A sum of 300,000F, paid to Montferrand this morning in the presence of his accountant, has gone missing. Theft appears to be the motive for the crime. Miss, when you left Montferrand, did he say he was expecting someone? No. Our conversation ended abruptly. Why? Night was falling. At 2:20 pm? We had nothing left to say. Is that so? I'll be going now, ladies. However, we may need to bother you again. Miss Verdier in particular. As a witness, you must remain in Paris. - Ladies. - Sir. See you very soon. Things are looking up! - Very funny. - I'm serious! A man tries to abuse you. An hour later they find him murdered. - God is on your side! - You think? Yes! You'll be summoned to testify. Witnesses earn 12F a day. Better than nothing. You'll be a sensation in court and in the press. Some publicity! Good sandwich. Where'd you buy it? Rue Monsieur-le-Prince. Still want to die? No. Put your hat on. - Where are we going? - To the cinema! What about André? He thinks I'm just a mistress? Then it's over. He'll never see me again! My mind's made up. I'll have success, money, respect. I'll be a famous actress. And I'll get married... if I want! - What is it? - Good evening. Police. I have a few questions about the young women on the 6th floor. I'm not surprised. Come in, Sir. The concierge is in... The concierge is shopping... BAD SEED L'Intransigeant! Exclusive story! Latest revelations in producer Montferrand's murder! L'Intransigeant! Thank you, Madame. I thought this might be an important piece of evidence. Indeed. Remarkable. Nice work, Mr. Brun. The friend who lives with her, Miss... Pauline Mauléon. How did she behave during questioning? Twice, she prevented Miss Verdier from speaking. She's clearly involved. Shocking. A pretty, educated young woman... You did say she's pretty? Very pretty. An actress. Goes to a producer's home to murder and rob him. - What's with you, Trapu? - Nothing. The state of their apartment indicates they're poor. Really? She's not engaged? According to the concierge, Mrs. Jus, a certain André Bonnard visits occasionally. It seems they broke up on the day of the crime. - According to the concierge. - Well, well! And Montferrand's butler made a statement. Where's that statement, Trapu? Unbelievable! Right here. At 2 pm, he showed Madeleine Verdier into the home of the victim, Mr. Montferrand. At 2:20, he ran an errand. Upon his return at 3:30, he found Mr. Montferrand shot in the head. Your thoughts, Trapu? Montferrand was an old libertine with multiple mistresses. A classic case of jealousy. An outraged husband... Kills his wife's lover? Could be. Then takes the wallet with 300,000F? Be reasonable! You asked my opinion. My mistake. Anyway, my mind is made up. I agree with you, my dear Brun. All these coincidences are problematic for the young lady. When is she coming? 4:15, Judge. She'll be here... in 15 minutes, if I may express my opinion. I'll be going. You no longer need me, Judge. Not for the moment, Mr. Brun. Montferrand was murdered on Saturday. Today is Tuesday, and we've got our man. Our woman, I mean. A case neatly solved. - If you say so. - What's with you today? Your bladder again? No, Judge. My bladder has improved significantly. Good. I don't share your enthusiasm, because the evidence you're mounting against this girl makes me fear another resounding judicial error. I appreciate your concern, but this time, I shall be circumspect. I will resist my personal views and accuse wisely. Spare me your worry and show in Mr. Palmarède. You really want to hear him? I said I'll be impartial. Mr. Palmarède. My dear Gustave! What, no embrace? It is not the friend who stands before you today, but the investigating judge. Right. How's your wife? None of your business. Sit down and answer my questions. As you wish. You knew Montferrand, right? You know I did. Last April, you purchased from him a property in Neuilly worth 8 million. Yes. The two of you agreed you would pay him in the form of a life annuity of 500,000F a year. Why the notes? I told you all that. Montferrand was only 62 years old. He was in good health. You were likely to pay for years to come. Indeed, his sudden death is one of the highlights of my life. I'll bet it is. Gustave, what are you implying? No one had more to gain from Montferrand's death than you. Therefore, I cannot continue investigating this case without asking what you did last Saturday, the day of the crime? Last Saturday... Lunch at your house. Any witnesses? You. Me? I don't count. I can't interrogate myself. Your wife, mine, your servants, the concierge. Right. I'll summon them. Summon your dog, too. He could testify. He laid at my feet! No irony, sir. So, you had lunch at my house? Yes. Type that, clerk! When did you leave? 5:30. Remember, we played bridge all afternoon. Are you sure? Rabusset, are you going senile? "Are you going senile..." Don't type that! And you, watch what you say to an acting judge! Honestly, your Honor, you suspect me of killing Montferrand? I'd be remiss in my duties if I didn't. His murder is worth 7.5 million to you! Good god! Remember, before I left, your wife served us tea at 5. Montferrand was killed at 3. How do you know? Well... it's front page news. Fair enough, you have an alibi. But crimes can be committed by proxy. - Meaning? - You could've hired someone. Paid a hit man. My poor Gustave, you should retire. "You should retire"... Don't type that! And you're an imbecile! That, you can type! Come on, Gustave! I forbid the acting judge to insult me. Palmarède, enough! Look me in the eyes and answer me. Were you or were you not involved in Montferrand's murder? Not remotely. I swear, Judge, on your wife's life. Thank you. I always knew it. I just had to hear it from you. Now go. I have no time for honest people. Trapu, please have Mr. Palmarède sign his statement. And show in Miss Madeleine Verdier. Who is this Miss Verdier? Top secret. But I won't be wasting my time with her. No alibi? I doubt it. Dear girl! You know her? Not at all. But if she did it, I'm forever grateful. 7.5 million! Miss Verdier. Gentlemen. Easy on the eyes, too. Excuse me. Miss Verdier, charmed to make your acquaintance. If my friend Rabusset's theories are correct, you can count on me forever. My card. Scram, my friend. I leave you in charming company. Yes, now go. Don't forget our dinner tomorrow. My alibi for the next crime! See you again, Miss. Go on, out. "Architect Master Builder..." Have a seat, Miss. Thank you for taking the trouble. You can trouble me every day for 12 francs. So, how long had you been seeing Mr. Montferrand? I met him for the first time last Thursday. - Where? - At the Variety Theater. I'm an actress. He asked me for my address. He invited me to come to his place on Saturday at 2. To offer you a role? I... I don't remember. Make an effort, Miss. I'd rather not say, out of respect for the great producer, but if you insist... I insist. Your Montferrand is a dirty old pig. - Miss! - Want the truth or not? Of course, go on. Mr. Montferrand was all over me. I did what any honest woman would do. I got out of there. How long were you with him? 15 or 20 minutes. You didn't get home until 5:15 pm. Neuilly to Rue Jacob takes an hour on foot. Did you run errands? No. I wandered. Odd! You told Mr. Brun night was falling and you were in a hurry. Recognize this weapon? Looks like my revolver. Mr. Brun stole it? The Law doesn't steal, Miss. It seizes evidence. Why do you own a revolver? Last year I was an understudy out of town. Late nights. Has it been long since you last fired it? Yes. But I almost fired it recently. At whom? Myself, Judge. I get tired of living. But you didn't do it. I wasn't brave enough. So why is the gun missing a bullet? Missing a bullet? Look, the cartridge. Now I remember! I wanted to try it out. So one day, in the country, I aimed at a bottle... Blew it apart. What if the missing bullet never hit any bottle, but entered Montferrand's skull? Funniest thing I ever heard! Quiet. Quiet! Stop laughing! Don't mock justice! I'll tell you what happened on Blvd d'Argenson! Oh yes, please do! Here's what happened. A penniless actress. Debt collectors line up at your door. You're about to be evicted, out on the streets. You wander aimlessly through Paris, your stomach growling. Then you meet the famous producer, Montferrand. You tug on his heartstrings. A kind-hearted man, he wants to help you. He invites you on Saturday at 2. Around noon, in a way I haven't yet figured out, you learn he received 300,000F that morning. The tragic solution forms in your mind! You take your revolver. You go to Neuilly. The butler shows you in, then runs errands. You're alone with the great producer in his empty villa, with its beautiful pool and vast grounds. The concierge's house is far away. Circumstances are favorable. The money is there, within reach. Tempting you! Calling to you! You can't resist. You shoot! And another woman becomes a criminal. Some imagination! And I take the money? Yes. The high life starts that very night. You go to the cinema. Confess, Miss. You're pretty. The jurors will be indulgent. You'll only get 20 years hard labor. Confess! What's that? L'Intransigeant, Judge. "Murder on Blvd d'Argenson "The 300,000F were found "in a mahogany box, "hidden under cigars!" We're always the last to know! Those ghastly reporters! Seems your theory doesn't hold up. May I get my 12F and go? No, Miss. The motive may be different, but you're still a prime suspect. Then I'll need my lawyer. That is your right. We'll find you one. I have one. Pauline Mauléon. You claim to be innocent, yet you already have a lawyer. So? We need to talk. He thinks I killed Montferrand... - Hello, Miss Mauléon. - Judge. Please have a seat. So, am I still the murderer? Absolutely. The money was found, so greed wasn't the motive. It was a crime of passion. Passion? You recently became Montferrand's mistress. Here we go again! Just a fling. A man of quality could never fall for a mediocre actress. How very kind! You were furious, humiliated, maybe even pregnant. A boy, a girl? Twins? No matter, you were desperate. You went back there. Begged him, "Take me back!" He refuses. "But I'm with child!" He laughs. "Then give me a role!" He sends you away. "Get out!" So you draw your revolver... and shoot. "Bang!" He collapses. Seduced, abandoned and pregnant, you have excuses. Verdict: 5 years in prison. Better than earlier, but still a lot. Premeditation, Miss. The intention to kill is clear. Because my client brought her gun? Precisely, Miss Mauléon. What proof is there? She identified it! That model is common in Paris. He may have had the same gun. Implying he killed himself? No, Judge. But a woman doesn't need to be pregnant to kill a man. She could come innocently, and find herself fighting off a brute! Terrified, she grabs a gun on the desk. Without thinking, to save her honor, to save her life... she shoots! What do you say to that? Bit melodramatic. But possible. Possibly. Would that woman get 5 years? Not necessarily. Legitimate defense. And no fine for bearing arms, since it wasn't hers. Then it's me. What? I confess. What? The crime is mine. I killed Montferrand. Handcuff me. Are you sure? I killed him with his gun, then took it home. Miss Mauléon, do you confirm? I confirm my client's confession. Trapu, what do you say? Congratulations, Judge! My dear girl, you confessed. I'm the happiest man alive. Me too. Well, woman! Will I go to jail? Sorry, it's inevitable. Don't be sorry. Our landlord is evicting us. So I'm doing you a favor? You are. She's delightful! Miss, could you please sign these rather contradictory statements? With pleasure! After the bloody murder committed by the Papin Sisters and the parricide by the poisoner Violette Nozières, a new criminal case makes headlines in Paris. Once again, the suspect is a woman! Madeleine Verdier, whose lawyer is inexperienced, allegedly killed, in his luxurious Neuilly villa, the great producer, Mr. Montferrand. Get in. Follow me. My darling. You're crying? No, I caught cold. My cell is terribly drafty. Do they feed you? Yes. I left nothing for the rats. You don't deserve this! Speaking of rats, heard from André? No. Surprised? Yes, a little. Hope is a sickness. Forget that lout André. Have faith! Even the newsreels are talking about you! - Really? - Yes. Look. For the jury. - You wrote my lines? - Yes. You can adapt. It's great. And my costume? Something simple. Mustn't provoke the jury. My button-up dress? Looks nice on you. Get some rest and learn your lines. Forget that dress. - Why? - It's green. So? Bad luck on stage! THE TRIAL BEGINS THE FAMOUS PRODUCER'S MURDERESS ON TRIAL AFTER NOZIERE, THE VERDIER SCANDAL THE VERDIER ENIGMA ANGEL OR DEMON? Lost Lamb or Cold Manipulator? Gentlemen, you must answer the following questions. First: Is Miss Verdier guilty of killing Mr. Montferrand? Second: Did she act with premeditation? Third: Was theft the motive for the crime? If all answers are yes, the defendant will be convicted. Her sentence will depend on whether you determine extenuating circumstances. Murderess! Order! We will begin with Miss Verdier. When I refused the 10,000F he offered me to play a maid just so I'd be his mistress, he began to shout. "In that case, you won't get a penny! "We're alone. I sent the butler away..." He's the one who sent him away? - Yes. - Sure, makes sense! Far more convenient! Order. Continue. He calmed down. Asked me to tell him about myself. My actress dreams. At first he was polite. Then a terrible struggle began. "Scream all you like, no one will come!" He pins me on the sofa. I bite him. Tear myself away, half-naked! Only your hat was found! Stop interrupting, Prosecutor! Continue, Miss. I try to flee. The door is locked. Montferrand runs over. And suddenly... on the desk... I spy a revolver. That one! Excuse me! You told Rabusset the gun was yours. You'd tried it out in the countryside. When my client spoke to Rabusset, she was merely a witness. Her words didn't count. Now she's a defendant. - She's telling the truth. - I swear. The gun belonged to Montferrand. How did it end up in my hand? How did I shoot? I don't remember. All I can say is that I vaguely heard a shot, then saw a man lying face down. He was so big. I set down 2 candlesticks on either side of his head. Candlesticks? They weren't found. Sorry! I confused it with another crime. You killed someone else? No, it's a scene from an old film. Continue, Miss. Continue. Horrified, I backed away and fled. With the gun? Obviously. Mr. Brun found it at my house. That all makes sense. Except for one thing. What? The 300,000F were found. But Montferrand's wallet wasn't. Are you quite sure, your Honor? Who says the wallet was on him? Maybe it was in his bedroom... or in a coat pocket. And in the chaos following the crime, one of his servants stole it? Exactly. What talent! What a wonderful actress! Order! Order in the court! I knew those girls were poor, struggling to pay the rent. So, with my big heart, although my wife was none too pleased, I was understanding. I never evicted them. Are you sure it was your big heart that kept you from evicting these girls? Were they not paying you in kind? Your Honor, that's a shocking insinuation! Prosecutor, please do not insinuate facts without proof. Thank you, your Honor. They had many visitors. Especially the actress. Nothing of interest. Wait! One fellow came regularly. A certain Mr. Bonnard. Very polite, well-bred. So why was he with a cheap actress? The concierge, Mrs. Jus, let me in with a spare key, while these ladies were at the cinema. I quickly located the revolver on the chest in the bedroom. That's when I noticed there was only one bed for these two people. What are you implying, Mr. Brun? That you shared a bed. The lawyer and the criminal are strange bedfellows! An unnatural pairing! Very interesting. Explains a lot about this crime. This hatred of men! You men should be ashamed. You've never known hardship or poverty. Yes, we shared a bed. To keep warm! What else can one do, when the electricity is cut off and space is limited? Have a heart, jurors. Leave these mediocre insinuations to these pathetic men! Order. Order, order! First, your Honor, for the past 3 months, bit by bit, I've realized how badly I behaved. When I announced my wedding and asked her to become my mistress, Madeleine had just killed a man for disrespecting her. Madeleine, what compelled you to spare me? I can't kill everyone. Did you despise me too much to waste a bullet? No. I loved you. How I regret damaging that love. When you stood me up, I figured I'd said something wrong. When I read about your arrest, and confession, I was so ashamed. Madeleine, please forgive me. Young man, this is not a theater. Get up. Mr. Bonnard, did you suspect Miss Verdier was a criminal? No. You knew she was an actress. Yes. Do you think she lied to you? No. I believe she was sincere. Did she know you were a Bonnard, in line to inherit a tire fortune? Of course. Might she have been attracted to your financial situation? That was secondary between us. She urged me to work, not depend on my father. Obviously. She'd just gotten 300,000F from Montferrand! Rookie error, Mr. Prosecutor. You forget the money was found in Montferrand's cigar box. The jury has heard the evidence. Prosecutor, you may now make your closing arguments. Gentlemen of the jury, we've been together for a week. We've gotten acquainted. I know you don't want this crime to go unpunished. We live in terrifying times. Read the papers. The press is accusing me, a defender of the public interest, guardian of the public good, of bullying this girl, making an example of her. When the criminal is a pretty woman, the victim is in the wrong! So I say yes! I want to make an example of Miss Verdier. Think of all the others! All the women who will kill us tomorrow! For years, women have been blithely eliminating us without a care! You know why? Because each time, they are acquitted! I've had enough! And I demand, unanimously, the ultimate punishment! He or she who inflicts death deserves death! I should know. I'm married, and my wife swore that if I ever cheated on her, she'd cut my throat with a razor! Gentlemen, we must dissuade our wives from this idea. We must frighten them, by sentencing Miss Verdier to death! The defense may now speak. Like Judith, Charlotte Corday, Medea or Lucretia, Madeleine Verdier wanted to show us, through her act of legitimate self-defense, that, since no one defends us, we women must defend ourselves and not hesitate to kill when our conscience requires it! Madeleine Verdier killed to defend herself. To preserve her virtue. For an honest woman cannot submit without protesting when such a brute assaults her! Protesting? A bullet from his own gun! Sir! All protest is a plea to awaken justice. By committing her crime in a French society dominated and corrupted by men, she was protesting all injustices done to we women, considered children for our rights, but adults for our mistakes! Defendant, please rise. As the law allows, would you like to speak one last time before the jury deliberates? Yes, your Honor. We're listening. Gentlemen of the jury, you who are men, only men, who will decide my fate, I would like to speak, through you, to women. To your daughters, to your mothers, to your wives, to your sisters. I want to say to them that, through my crime, I unwittingly defended our common cause. The cause of women, alone, poor and honest, who society delivers to the base instincts of men. I never thought I'd have to kill to defend myself. Until that day, when unfortunately I encountered a man who wanted to abuse me, rape me, and make me his object of pleasure. Sure, you'll say I'm an actress, dependent upon the gaze, the desires, and the power of men. But could it be possible, in 1935, for a woman to conduct her career and her life without constraints, with full freedom and full equality? Order, order! Bravo, Madeleine! - For Miss Verdier. - More? Beautiful. Who sent these? An admirer, probably the judge. No, he can't afford these. Thank you, Mrs. Jus! In 40 years, I never dared kill my husband. If I'd only known! "To thunderous applause, "the judge declared the acquittal of Madeleine Verdier. "The pretty defendant was pale as a ghost." Others said you were beet red! Each paper has its opinion. "She received a long ovation..." This one's not as good. "The Verdier girl is better at crime than theater. "The scandalous success of Montferrand's murderess "is the mark of a decadent society "that praises a bad actress for killing a man..." Ok, we won't keep that one. - And Le Figaro? - One of the best! My reviews are great overall. Mine too. One lawyer said I talked too much. You were amazing, my darling. You wrote a great monologue. I owe it to you. Pauline! - What? - They want me for Suzette's Ordeal! The producer wants to meet me! Careful. He surely has a sofa. Don't worry, he knows what I'm capable of. Requests for interviews... Madeleine, Pathé-Nathan producer Mr. Nathan offers you the lead in The Bitter Tears of Marie Antoinette! And the Normandy Hotel is giving me a room for August! Hey, why don't we move? Find a flat with running water, bathroom and telephone? We have offers, not money. True. Pauline... Life seems so different now. There's nothing like success to bring joy back. Danielle Darrieux said that in Cinemonde. Happiness is a tiny thing And always its reality Reminds me of a rose in spring Its scent and its fragility... The reporter from Paris-Soir! He's cute. I said he could interview you. Please! - Hello, Gilbert. - Hello, Miss. I'm listening. I'm thrilled to be the first to interview you after that historic day. - Thank you. - Anytime. So, Miss Verdier, was this your first killing? - Yes, sir. - Any remorse? None at all. When you saw his body collapse in a pool of blood, what did you feel, exactly? A kind of... pride. The word is theatrical! Did he say anything before dying? Ask forgiveness? No point. What wit! Miss Mauléon, you must also be proud. I didn't kill anyone! Don't be modest! The triumph is yours too. You pled splendidly. Thank you! What are your plans? I don't know yet. I'm studying many offers. Fabulous. Thank you, ladies. I'll be writing a great piece. André! The witness from the trial! Yes. André Bonnard, 26 years old, who thought he knew women, but is an idiot. Unable to spot the purest, most beautiful woman. - Fascinating! - Don't mention this. I'm paid to be indiscreet, but I have limits. I'll show you out. Isn't he the heir to Bonnard Tires? What now? I've thought long and hard. A woman who commits a crime to stay pure is not mistress material. You marry her. You're already married! The wedding's postponed. The Courteils won't see me again! Madeleine, what's wrong? Flowers, applause... offers of plays and films, and now you're back! It's too much. My darling. What will your father say? He'll cut me off, but who cares? I'll do anything for you. Even work! André's marrying me! And he'll work! Wow! Your crime makes miracles! To the gallows! Kill her! Sorry, Sir, I didn't mean to! Vive la République! Vive la Révolution! Cut! Cut! That's a wrap! - Bravo! Fantastic. - Thanks. - Congratulations. - Thanks. - Very moving. - Thank you so much. See you tomorrow. How's your neck? Hopefully no crick. I'm nervous about tonight. Don't worry. I went to the theater yesterday. Suzette's Ordeal was sold out. Madeleine, smile! Madeleine, please! I'm expected at the theater! Sorry, I'm late! Hurry! Ladies, please. April 27th? Your father secretly planned your wedding to Berthe? - Why? - He needs money. The dowry, and her father investing a million! - But Bonnard Tires? - Recession, strikes... And Dad made bad investments. So you have to save him? Not anymore. I'm done with him. I won't come between you and your father. - It's the only solution. - We'll find another one. Will you kill again? We'll see. Sir. Thanks. Suzette's Ordeal Hello, Simone. Any stage fright? Yes. You'll see, it comes with talent. You exaggerate. I'm at the end of my rope. What's wrong? It's Emile. - Your husband? - No, my lover. Emile Bouchard. - Is he cheating? - I wish! - Beating you? - He wouldn't dare. Then what? I wonder if I should kill him. Whatever for? He bores me! That's hardly a reason. Excuse me. He paws me every 15 minutes! Don't you like it? With someone else, why not? I figure you killed a man who abused you once and got acquitted. Emile's on me night and day! I may have a chance. Your case is totally different! Montferrand wasn't my lover. Emile's doing his duty! Is your Emile here? Front row. Obviously! Suzette, a girl's mother is her best guide. Don't make my mistake. The road to love is paved with sacrifice. Ignore your feelings. Marry that man, and your status as a woman will rise. A new life will begin. Wealth and happiness will be yours! No, Mother. Without love, my ordeal will never end. Simone! - They'd better beware. - Of Madeleine? No, me. Don't be jealous. She's a great actress now. She has admirers. - Is she playing with me? - No. Get used to it. She's a celebrity. People will covet her. - Hands off! - Simone, kiss me! - Just a kiss! - No, please! Behave! You're killing me! Miss Verdier! - Still no need for renovations? - Not really. Pauline and I are renting a private mansion in Boulogne. - Got running water? - Of course. Good pressure? Just right. A few pipes must need adjusting. I'll think it over. I owe my new fortune to you. I'd love to invite you to my new place in Paris. Avenue Frochot... Sounds familiar. Be right back. It belonged to the late Montferrand. I see. His bachelor place? Yes. Will you introduce us? Mr. Palmarède, architect and master builder... My future fiancé, André Bonnard. Congratulations. An honorable choice. Bonnard, like the tires? Yes, Sir. My deepest sympathies. With the chaotic markets and social strife, I hope Bonnard's stock isn't sinking. Thank you, but rest assured. "Bonnard tires go farther, faster!" Amusing. Let's hope that slogan boosts the workers and the stock. Good morning. Sleep well? André didn't stay? No. My good boy is saving himself. Can you wait that long? Sure, I love him. - Yes, Céleste? - A visitor for Miss Verdier. Odette Chaumette? Sounds familiar. Know her? - No. - Me neither. Say I'm busy. She insists. Insist she leave! Very well, Miss. They loved it last night. How do you feel? Relieved and reassured. The trial gave me confidence. Thanks to you, dear lawyer. Pleading today? No. 12 cases in a month. The criminals are killing me! Excuse me. The lady won't leave. She sent this. Another fanatic! What is it? Read it. - My god. - It had to happen. - What's she want? - This is awful! We must see her. Show her in. Yes, Miss! Here she is. Hello, dolls! Madame. The lawyer's here too. What a phony! I beg your pardon! So it's you? Odette Chaumette in the flesh! Montferrand's one and only killer. What do you want? What a question! You thought I'd sit down and take it? While you pocket the loot? I have my limits, dolls. I don't get it. Look at this palace! Such luxury! - And that robe! - Hands off! Before the crime, you lived in a dump. You've risen since I downed Montferrand. This "luxury" is the fruit of our labors. And I'm in a jam! I'm the one who deserves the fruits. You stole my crime. Give it back! How do we know you're the real murderer? - What's that? - His wallet, Miss Lady Lawyer. With all his papers. How do you think I got it? Strong evidence. - So it was you? - Yes, my pretty. Tell us how. I'd love to know the real story. Very well. Have a seat. As you know, I'm a great tragedian. You're an actress too? Of course! You were in Max Linder's Magic Flute! I've been in over 100 films, Miss. With Feuillade, Gance and the great Alice Guy. - A silent actress? - Never made it in talkies! Montferrand and I went way back. Last century? Please. I debuted onscreen in 1905, in Innocent Amélie. Montferrand was my chauffeur. On the heels of my success, he became a big producer. And also my lover. A bit rude, but regular. Recently he'd been stringing me along, promising to orchestrate my comeback. So you killed him? Among other reasons, yes. I'd heard he'd just received 300,000F. - A trifle for him. - So? So, he receives me. We chat a bit. I beg him to loan me a bit of cash. Irritated, he grabs his gun and orders me to leave. Look. The murder weapon. Yet more proof! In a sense, I was... acting in self-defense. I go over to seduce him. I remind him of our glorious beginnings in our youth. I work my magic. He relaxes. Then it's a blur. A shot fired, he hit the floor, I was in trouble. My first murder! Did you expect this? Not at all. Go on, Madame. I looked for the money. Nothing. Who hides cash in a cigar box? I took his wallet in consolation. A mere 900F! - Bad luck. - My luck needs to turn! You showed me how. If you'd gotten death, I'd have kept quiet! But acquittal, money and fame for eliminating that pig? I'd be a fool not to talk! Dear lady, your case is totally different! You'll get 20 years hard labor. - Why? - Madeleine was defending her honor. - Me too! - She's a virgin. Me too! Kind of. The jury will laugh. I'll say he abused me. I was his sex slave. And it wasn't for money, since they found it! And the wallet? I won't show it. Then you have no proof. I'll show it and say I took it for the love letters. You wrote love letters? No, but I can. She has all the answers. Indeed. Her case holds up. A crime of passion. Will you be my lawyer? - Why not? - Pauline! No, I can't defend two people for the same crime. Shame. You're talented, and jurors like pretty women. Helps the case. I'm not pretty, Mme. Chaumette. Don't say that. I quite fancy you. So, what do you intend to do? I have no money, no career, no food. Nothing to lose. I'll turn myself in. You wouldn't! I would. Unless... Unless? We make a deal. Give me a piece. I get it now. My crime paid off for you. I need... my cut. - How much? - Not much. 300,000F. What I would've gotten if... We're not rich, we rent on credit! You can get money if you try. Maybe. But I refuse to try. Beware! - I mean what I say. - You don't scare me. You're crazy. Let her do it. - You refuse my offer? - Absolutely. Céleste, show her out. "To the sublime, heroic... "murderer of Montferrand!" - The flowers! - Read the papers tomorrow and you'll understand these are mine. Bye, Madame Chaume. Chaumette! Odette Chaumette. We're cooked! I'll be disbarred. You'll lose your career, and André. Stop worrying, she's bluffing. She has nothing to lose. A has-been waiting to die in a blaze of glory on stage! Getting old is hard. Especially for an actress. She was so beautiful in Magic Flute. She's still is, for her age. She's red-hot! One compliment and you're hooked. Mr. Gilbert Raton, reporter, wishes to see you both. - Chaumette already talked? - Impossible. Let's get the press on our side. Show him in. Still flirting with him? He's a kid, he's fun. Hi, Gilbert. What brings you? Thanks for seeing me. I want your impressions of last night's tragedy. What tragedy? - You don't know? - No, tell us. - Your mother! - My mother? In the play, Simone Bernard! What? She killed her lover, Emile Bouchard! She did it? You knew? She mentioned it once. My crime is pushing women over the edge. She calls you her role model, and wants to hire you. - You'll be her lawyer! - Yet another. Can we get an exclusive peek at your defense strategy for Simone Bernard? The terrible conditions for women in the 20th century. What else? Can you explain? Do you find it normal, Mr. Raton, that women are paid lower salaries for equivalent work, and still can't vote? Fortunately, women have their husbands' salaries. What if we don't want a husband? Or... we killed him? Right. Good point. Would voting rights have prevented Simone Bernard, or Miss Verdier, from committing their crimes? To quote my colleague Yvonne Netter, "Women will get what they want only with the vote." What do you say to the socialist senators who claim that letting women vote, as in Germany, will lead us to electing a French Hitler? Until the sexes have equal rights and possessions under the law, and that law is respected, the planets will not align. And women will get what they want... only with crime! Sir, is this where we become a prisoner? Pardon me? Can you take my confession? Certainly, Madame. Follow me. Which crime did you commit? Murder. What a godsend! This year, murderers are so hard to find. - Madame. - Sir. You claim to have killed. I assume your crime was trivial? Hardly! Only the most notorious crime in recent years. Which one? - Montferrand's murder. - Montferrand? Montferrand! That case was closed ages ago! You'll have to reopen it. That Verdier girl didn't do it. Are you kidding? I kid you not! I'm dead serious. Miss Verdier confessed. The investigation proved she did it. But the investigating judge was Rabusset, a real noodle! Trapu! Why is he laughing? He's Judge Rabusset! - Just my luck! - Out! Yes, Judge! This case is a hoot! So you're Rabusset? You've moved up the ladder? Yes, Madame. The Montferrand case is precisely what allowed this "noodle" to rise and gain praise from my hierarchy. Take a seat. The murder weapon, Montferrand's initialed wallet, his voter ID and license. Where'd you get it? The victim's pocket. My victim! Look! No! I shouldn't even look at those falsified documents and innocent weapon! Innocent? We have the murder weapon with the other evidence! And the wallet? I don't want to know! Well, I never! Use your head. The trial is over, case closed. Everyone loved the outcome. - Except me! - Right. But I was thrilled to find the guilty woman in 48 hours. It was a personal win for the presiding judge. The jury was praised by the press. And Dr. Pandru proved that the fatal bullet was fired from our gun! You want them to look like imbeciles? You'll just say, "I did it!" and we'll cuntvict you? "Convict." No, Madame. Too convenient! So you're a corrupt noodle! Watch what you say. We're in a temple of justice. Then be just! It's not about being just, but doing justice. Two different things. Just as 2 + 2 = 4, her confession was a lie! We cannot deprive her of her conviction! The law says only a convict can ask for a new trial. If you claim you committed this murder, you are the liar. You'll get 2 months in jail for contempt of court. I'm not here for jail time! We're drowning in unsolved crimes. Accuse yourself of one! Here's a good one. The killer ax-murdered 6 victims. Beautiful crimes. Your lawyer will say you acted in fit of alcoholic delirium or senile dementia. You'll get 20 years hard labor, plus free food and board. I don't need free food. And hard labor? Never! So what do you want? What was stolen from me! A sensational acquittal, respect and lots of money! I see... A crime of passion. I'll find you one. A crime of passion... We have this widower. Strangled in his bed. His money was under his mattress. Not the motive. He resisted your advances, so you killed him. - How old was he? - 76. Too old. I'd be acquitted to bad reviews. Why not use my very own crime? That crime is not available! Fine, I'll go to the press and the Justice Minister. I'm sure they're not noodles! Wait, Madame, wait. Let's say I cuntvict you of this crime. That's more like it! No extenuating circumstances. No one will believe your crime was motivated by passion, self-defense or any respectable motive. I'm a great actress. Far better than Verdier. I'll seduce the jury as I seduced my public worldwide! Sorry, but who are you? Odette Chaumette. In the flesh. Never heard of her. For the last time, will you choose an unsolved crime? I'm not Verdier, I don't steal crimes! You know... criminals who claim innocence bother me, but innocents who claim guilt drive me nuts! I have guests for dinner. Leave. Come back only for an available crime. I bid you farewell. Fine, Rabusset. Want a scandal? You'll get it! So? What a bad schemer. But what a great artist! You know her? Magic Flute! Madame Chaumette! We were looking for you! You saw the judge? The judiciary is worse than I thought. I'm going to the press. The press, really? Got my money? Better. A serious offer. - Waiter! - Ladies. Two coffees. Odette? Beer, and sauerkraut with 4 sausages. My god, La Chaumette! Odette Chaumette! My favorite actress! What an honor! I've seen all your films! I'm your biggest admirer. Thank you! You've touched my heart. Finally, I hear your voice! Enough. Go. It never ends! They all want me back. - But I killed Montferrand. - Regrets? Not a one. Found a way to eliminate me? Odette, you're a great artist. The waiter is right. As sisters-in-arms, we... Cut to the chase. Got my money? Better. - Your theatrical comeback. - How? In Suzette's Ordeal. The role of Suzette! No, her mother. I'm Suzette. A supporting role? Yes, but you'd be fantastic. You'd wow your admirers. What about old Simone? She's rotting in jail. She was that bad? The champagne is on the house. Charming. - Your 4 sausages. - And my beer! Of course, Madame. A drop of champagne? Why not? - Thank you. - You're welcome. Do you accept, Odette? You have 24 hours to get my money. Please give us a week. 24 hours is all I can do. - I'll do the play on one condition. - What? The mother becomes her sister. Her sister? Yes, her sister! Well... older sister, if you prefer! This crime is getting thorny. Next time I'll commit it myself. Thanks, Albert. Sure you want to go? He offered his help. Might as well take it. Is he dangerous? We'll see. Where does he live? Avenue Frochot... Want me to come? No, it might be long. Aristotle said, "Self-sacrifice is the condition for virtue." Not sure that helps me. Miss Verdier, what a surprise. Is this a bad time? Not at all, come in. Excuse my attire. Want a drink? A stiff one, very stiff. - Pastis. - What? A new drink from the South. "Marseilles sunshine in a bottle!" "Dilute with water or be dazzled." Here you go. You know the place, right? No, first time. Charming. Really? I thought you committed your crime here. No, in Neuilly. Cheers. I put in new wallpaper, that's all. Anyway. To what do I owe this charming, unexpected visit? I need your help. The pipes? No, my... my plumbing works great. Paint? Electricity? Miss? Feeling unwell? Must be the Pastis. I'm not your type? Sure you are. Then what? I'm in love, Miss Verdier. - In love? - Yes. With my wife. Is it a crime? I'm so sorry! All is forgiven. Women don't always need to offer themselves to men to get help. You'll help me? I'm all ears. What a good man! No need to put out or kill. Ideal. Maybe he's in the closet? He says he loves his wife. - That exists? - What? Love, men of virtue... Yes. He and my dear André make two. You look disappointed. I quite fancied Palmarède. He has a certain charm. His accent, his joviality. I'd have made the sacrifice. And André? He'll be a perfect husband. He respects me and I adore him. But I'm sick of waiting. So why not take a lover? Silence is far more eloquent Than any fancy words Without a word We speak far better... of love Mr. Palmarède. Show him in. - Mr. Bonnard! - Hello. What can I do for you, Mr. Palmarède? I came to discuss Miss Verdier. Has she finally left my son? No. I'd like you to marry them as soon as possible. Leave, Sir. Discussion over. Mr. Bonnard, I'm from Marseilles. You can stop us from drinking, eating or sleeping. But not talking! Sit down. - Is she your mistress? - I'm married, Sir. Men from Marseilles are more faithful than Parisians? Not at all. Have you forgotten how she treats men who disrespect her? She's a convicted criminal. Not fit for my family! She was acquitted. The justice system is often wrong. I will not consent to a mankiller marrying my son! She doesn't want to come between you and André. She wants you to lead her down the aisle. With one condition. She dares to impose conditions! She insists I invest 1.5 million in your business. What? I myself exclaimed, "Come now, that's crazy! "Bonnard Tires is on the road to ruin! "Might as well toss my money in the Seine!" Excuse me, but... your information is incorrect. Who on earth told you such a thing? Let me explain. The crisis hit us like everyone else. But if we get through the next months, spend 500,000F on advertising and fit some racecars with our tires, you'll make a 15% profit on your 1.5 million! That's what Madeleine says. Why her interest in my business? She knows her children will bear your name. She fears her dear father-in-law will go bankrupt. Quite an unusual girl. As gracious as they come. What did you say? I said yes, to make her happy. I get it. She's your natural child. I've only known her, and loved her, since her crime. Killing Montferrand was such a wonderful gesture! I may be losing my sense of good and evil. What? Miss Verdier. She knows I'm here and can't wait to meet you. Is she armed? Mr. Bonnard! A murderess in my office! Mr. Bonnard... Miss Madeleine Verdier. I'm thrilled to finally meet you! I didn't expect you to be so sweet, fatherly and warm. And you, so pretty. Hello, Miss Verdier. I hope my friend Mr. Palmarède has been eloquent. He made very convincing arguments. - Unexpected ones. - Really? My son loves you, and now I see why. I thought you opposed our marriage! Your intelligence, your courage... your honesty! You committed an illegal act to remain faithful to my son. Never judge people by their acts. Judge their motives! And an acquittal is a certificate of integrity! Perfect! Then that's settled. My work is done. As for the 1.5 million... I'll come see you. Anytime. - Goodbye, kid. - Thanks, my friend. See? I'm a man of my word. This way. Who bought these? My secretary. I wanted to know my son's beloved. Where is he? I want to tell him the news. He's picking me up for dinner. Let's make it a family celebration. Your paternal clemency prompts me to confess. I'd have spoken sooner, but I wanted you to like me despite my crime. Enough of all that. I'll never mention it again. I'm listening. The crime is not mine. What are you saying? The truth. For the first time in ages. - It wasn't you? - No. I didn't deny it because I was unhappy. And that judicial error launched my career. But I mustn't play a role with my dear father-in-law. Here's the truth. As Phaedra says, "Thank God, my hands are not criminals." How admirable! What an immense relief! So who did it? A certain Odette Chaumette. The actress? You know her? A star in my youth! "Silent cinema's most expressive eyes!" Well, she's jealous of my success. If I don't give her 300,000F, she'll tell the press she did it. What a story! Did you make it up for me? I expected your skepticism, so in one minute... you'll have proof. Proof? Pauline Mauléon, lawyer. - My future father-in-law. - Sir. Nice to meet you. Congratulations to you both. Mr. Bonnard doesn't believe my story. Let's prove it. Odette's waiting with the used tires. Chaumette, here? - Another murderer? - You let me in. You're different! She'll confirm my innocence. Mostly she wants her money. Will you pay her? No need. Now that you know, she no longer scares me. Your respect means more than fame. What an admirable daughter-in-law! All of Paris will know your son is wedding a virtuous woman with a clean record. Show her in, Pauline. Wait a minute... What is it? I just thought of something. What? If it comes out that you didn't kill Montferrand, won't that damage your reputation with Palmarède? Sure, he'll be disappointed. Less inclined to be nice. - Indeed. - No matter! We'll work. Even André! Your business should be booming again in a few years. That'll be a bit late. Forget my business. I'm thinking of you two. That crime made you famous and appealing. La Chaumette's revelations will damage your careers. You as an actress, and you as a lawyer. The honor of the Bonnards above all! The honor of justice above all! I cannot accept such sacrifices. It's working! Show in the murderer! Odette Chaumette! In the flesh! My respects, Madame. How I admire your past career in silent cinema! My career is not past. It forever shines and bounces back! Come see me in Suzette's Ordeal. My big comeback! I can't wait! La Verdier will get you front row seats. So, you claim to have killed Montferrand? Yes. A crime of passion. These ladies surely gave you the proof. You plan to go to the press? It'll be headline news if I'm not paid today. Here you are. You can cash it today. Happy days! See? It wasn't that hard. However, dear Odette, to prevent an encore, we want the wallet. Your trust is touching! Since it's you, I'll happily hand it over. "In the shadow of a burning bush." Who are you, Mr. Benefactor? A pimp to 2 call girls? La Verdier's suitor? The pretty lawyer's cousin? He's my father-in-law. A good marriage too! - My crime paid off for you. - You too! True, my kitten. I'm off to the bank. See you onstage. What an actress! - I prefer her silent work. - Yes! Magic Flute! Thank you for your gesture. If she'd talked, you'd have been in hot water. Indeed. Better not tell anyone else the truth. Except André, of course. He'll be so glad to learn his wife is not a criminal. - Let's keep André out of this. - Really? Let's keep it between us. Our secret. As you like. Thank you. There you are! Should've told me sooner, dummy! - What? - That you love her! You'd be married by now! What a surprise! Don't argue, just kiss her. You despised her crime! It was explained to me wrong. Dad, I knew when you learned the details of her crime, you'd admire her as I do. She killed to remain faithful to me! No woman has ever been so loyal to a man. I love her. I love you! See? Better not tell! Hands off! What are you doing here? Stop or I'll shoot! Let me go! You saved me! He's still moving! We'll face this ordeal together, Suzette. In solidarity, fighting. For in this unfair world of powerful, cruel men, there is no greater consolation than that found in the arms of a sister! Subtitles by Sionann O'Neill
