The collection of information, becoming knowledgeable, or the acquisition of a skill should be only for the purpose to achieve greater harmony among people, to help the less fortunate, or to have a better understanding of our fellow man. The film that you are about to see has to do with a better understanding of our fellow man. We have gathered the information as intelligently and as honestly as is within our power and potential. And we would like to portray to you as intellectually as our meeting will permit, the findings of our research. It is in story form, but the findings will be shown as they exist in real life. And this type of individual is factual. Any facet of our lives that is left unexamined is a potential source of danger. Only by open inquiry is it possible to understand the underlying causes of the conditions of personality that we call deviation. The people you are about to meet may shock you. They may frighten you. But we hope that by this factual exposition we can broaden your view towards this type of individual, and increase your capacity to sympathize with the unexplainable drives and anxieties that constantly haunt them. To illustrate our findings we have opened file number 743. Subject's name: Albert Rose, age 28. Athletic, aesthetic type. Father dominating, formerly a military officer, now in the Congress of the United States. Mother submissive, neurasthenic, doting on the child Albert. History of pathological disturbances on the mother's side of the family. To this point, Albert has been an aggressive, playboy-ish, affluent young man. He spent two years in the army in Korea distinguishing himself in action. He likes to surround himself with attractive women. Given to impulsive acts to demonstrate his manliness. Fond of flashy clothing. By all appearances, Albert Rose is a normal American male. From the time he's vacationing in the Caribbean. Let me see his picture. He's looking well. Very noble, wouldn't you say? Take this message down for Mr. Rose. Let's see just how noble he really is. My dear Mr. Rose, I'm in possession of certain incriminating material concerning you and your father. It would be unfortunate at this point in your father's political career if this information were to reach the newspapers. However, I'm sure with your cooperation this can be prevented. My private plane is at your disposal. A car will be waiting at your hotel at exactly 3 p.m. to take you to the airport. Until then. Do you think he'll come? Albert loves a challenge. He'll come. Paging Mr. Albert Rose. Mr. Albert Rose. Over here. What time is it? It's 2 o'clock here. Boy. - Send someone for my bags in thirty minutes. - Yes, sir. Hey! What the hell? What? Who are you? Listen to this, Al. My name is Dominique Festro. The following are the true facts concerning the actions of Lieutenant Albert Rose on the night of August 4th, 1951. It was during a battle near Imjin province in Korea, my company, which was led by Lt Rose, was pinned down by superior enemy forces. We befall several attacks, but our casualties were high. Lt Rose's conduct had been strange during the battle. And I noticed that he was not firing, but crouching in his foxhole. Finally, as the reds charged once more, I saw the lieutenant break and move to the rear. That's ridiculous. Just a minute, Al. Both Corporal Leroy Parker and I saw the Lieutenant desert under fire. I decided however, not to say anything realizing that any man can break at one time or another. When I returned to camp I found myself charged with desertion under fire. Lt Rose had offered Cpl Parker a large sum of money to charge me with desertion under fire in order to protect himself. I had no choice except to flee. I am still a fugitive, but I hope one day Cpl Parker will come forward to clear my name at which time I will testify. Is that the incriminating material you have against me? How will you disprove these charges? In the first place, it's my word against his. Who'd believe him? A coward, a deserter? It was he who ran that night. I know. I shot at him until I got his leg. He spent three months in the hospital, and then escaped. No one else has seen him for a long time. And if that's not enough, Cpl Parker will testify on my behalf. Can you, Al? Yes, of course. My name is Leroy Parker. I want to make this confession to undo a terrible thing I've deprived of Dominique Festro. On the night of August 4th, 1951 Private Festro and I witnessed a desertion under fire by Lt Albert Rose commanding officer of our platoon. When I returned to camp, Lt Rose offered me $25,000 if I would testify that it was Pvt Festro who had deserted, and not he. I needed the money very badly as my family was destitute. So, I agreed. I have suffered for it ever since, and I would now like to clear my conscience. What did you pay him to do that? Pay him? Well, it doesn't matter. I can challenge Parker to take a lie detector test. What do you have then? Unfortunately, Cpl Parker died suddenly. Just after he made this confession. - What? - That's right, Al. And Pvt Festro disappeared right after giving us his statement. So that you can't very well challenge him to a lie detector test either. That changes things, doesn't it Al? Just relax. I have more to show you just in case you aren't convinced. This kind of plane costs extra, sir. Honey, you can pay me. When's the last time you got this kind of treatment? You think you're quite a stud, don't you sir? I know that about planes, yeah. How's that? You're pretty good around there. Do you recognize the voice, Al? Well if you don't, take a look at this. Hold tight. - A girl. - I can't see that that makes any difference. I said who is that damn girl? Al, don't get excited. It's just a prostitute. Now, suppose we get down to business? Are you convinced that we have a good case? How much do you want? Oh, we'll get to that. Right now I want something more valuable. - And what is that? - Time. Quit being cute and let's lay it on the line. Alright, Al. I want one year of your life. You're crazy. It's a fair exchange, I think. After all, if I release this information then the court-martial could cost you ten years, perhaps even your life. Instead, I sell it to you for just one year. Why? For what? I have a job I want you to perform. What kind of job? I want you to be my personal servant. You want what? I said I want you to be my personal servant. What kind of servant? Don't worry? There'll be no painful or dangerous work involved. Why me? You're available and suited for the work. What about the money? $20,000. We'll draw it out of your account tomorrow. And after that year's up? You'll be free to go. Do you agree? Do I have a choice? No. You can call me Dominita. Mix me a drink. You can have one too, if you like. If we're going anywhere, I have to get a few things taken care of. I'll have to call my father, he'll be worried. It's all arranged, Al. We're leaving as soon as the bank opens in the morning. You'll have no trouble cashing the check. And as for your father, just sign the letter on the bar. You don't miss a trick, do you? What do you mean, Al? This letter. Perfect, isn't it? If I didn't know better, I'd think I wrote it myself. I know. Before we go, I have some pills for you. Pills? What kind of pills? Oh Ruth, bring Albert his pills, won't you? Yes Dominita. - Make it the white ones. - Yes Dominita. Here Albert, you take one three times a day. Make it four times a day. Oh, and take that letter and mail it this evening. - Mr. Rose and I have a great deal to talk about. - Yes. Will there be anything else before morning, Dominita? No, that'll be all. You may go. Now Albert, where were we? Oh, no matter. Shall we drink a toast? To the year? A year of change? Thank you, Mrs. Dowling. Good morning. Oh, I'm sorry sir, but a check of this amount, I have to have it OK-ed by the president. Pardon. Where do we go from here? Dominita's place in the country. Do you realize I don't know where I am? I presume this is Florida. Would you like to have a cashier's check for this, sir? Cash, please. Thank you. Just be patient, Dominita will explain everything. Yeah. Guess I'll have plenty of time for questions. Can I have a cigarette, please? Thank you. - You have the money? - Yes, Dominita. It's all here. Fine, let's go then. We have a long drive ahead of us. Ruth, show Mr. Albert into the living room. Yes, Dominita. I'll join you in a moment. Did the new one arrive yet? Yes, Dominita. She's being briefed now. What is she to be? Well, she's not attractive enough to be an agent, and we need another gardener. Take her to the transformation room immediately. I think more time's needed for her to adjust. She'll have all the time she needs to adjust, til tomorrow morning. And get that hair back off your forehead. This is like a nightmare. What is this place anyway? You'll find out soon enough, Albert. Yes, you'll find out soon enough. I hope you like it here, because this is going to be your home for the next year. This is all very nice, but what I wanna know is what kind of servant am I to be? You're going to be my maid, Albert. Your maid? Forget it. You must think I'm as crazy as you are. Think of it as a game. You're going to be my personal maid. That's absurd. It's ridiculous. It won't seem that way for long. Ruth, I want you to take personal charge of Mr. Rose. Begin the transformation immediately. - I'll check on the results in one week. - Yes, Dominita. Now Al, I'll show you your room. Well, here we are. Home, sweet home. Hey, what did she mean, "transformation"? Oh, you're to be transformed into the maid. Oh, I see. I'm gonna wear a short skirt and a pinafore. Oh no. No. You're out of your mind. You're both out of your mind. I won't do it. You don't have any choice, Al. Remember? The hell I don't. I'll dig ditches. I'll empty the garbage. But, I'm not letting her turn me into any drag queen. Don't let it upset you, Al. It's just a game, so play along with it. Anyway, I'll be the only one who sees you and... I'll understand. Understand what? Well, how you feel. Do you think I enjoy being here? - You mean, Dominita's blackmailing you? - That's right. But, why? What does this mean? What does she want from all of us? Our souls. I think she wants to own us. You mean everyone here is trapped? In one way or another, yes. What is it she has on you? I'll tell you some other time. Right now we've gotta get started on your transformation. No. Not now. Let me get used to the idea for a while. Alright, Al. That may make things worse. Excuse me, Dominita. Mr. Herman's here to see you. Send him in. Come in Herb. Have a seat. Now, what can I do for you? Well, what I came by to talk to you about the sale short order that your secretary phoned in. Frankly Dominita, I don't understand it. International Polyester's has been a real glamor issue and it's been on the upside for months. You could lose a fortune overnight. You mean, you didn't execute it? Dammit Herb, I told you before. Don't try to tell me how to spend my money. Well, Dominita... - I only thought... - For your information, when the papers hit the street tomorrow morning the bottom will fall out of International Polyester. You didn't know that, did you? That's why you're nothing but a two-bit broker instead of in my position. Now get out of here and execute my orders. Ruth! Show Mr. Herman the door. I can find my way out. Oh by the way, there are two new recruits arriving tomorrow. Put one in the kitchen and the other... make her a laborer. By the way, how's our new maid coming along? He's getting used to the idea. I think he'll be able to start soon. Soon? What do you mean soon? It's been two days already. How much longer do I have to be kept waiting? I warn you Ruth, this will make me very unhappy. Come in. Everything is ready in the shop for that new one. She's to become John the gardener. But, we may have trouble with her. Trouble? Come Ruth, this will be good for your education. Just what is the problem here? Now, now, we're going to be friends, aren't we? I think we understand each other now. Please Al. Please, for me? We've only got three days. Won't be so bad. Well, maybe not. Hey, you don't have to prove anything to me. I just thought we'd make sure it's gonna be pretty hard to tell the difference around here after a while. Ruth, come to my office. Yes, Dominita. Here. Take this razor and go in there and shave. Everything. Put these on. I'll be back in a minute. - Everything? - Everything. Al, your stockings are in the dressing room. Sit down. Do you remember that lovely little picture I have of you and Sandra? Well, I'm thinking of sending it home to your mother. Would you like that? No. You swore you wouldn't. If you'd obeyed orders. Rose is mine. Everyone and everything here is mine. Do you understand? Yes. So does Albert. Don't put your hands on him again. And I want this change speeded up. She's to serve my evening meal. So give her her new name. That's all. There now. That wasn't so bad, was it? I don't know. I feel strange. What did Dominita want? She must've seen us earlier. She told me to leave you alone. She threatened to use the material she has against me. Well, what's stopping us from marching in there and burning up all those letters and tapes? The bodyguard, for one thing. Besides, she keeps a secret duplicate file. - She has all the angles figured out, doesn't she? - Yes, she does. So, we'd better get started. Start with the brows. Let me get your wig. Meet Rose Albert. That is your new name. My god. This is going to be a bit uncomfortable but you might as well learn. Here. It hooks in the middle. You're not gonna put that on me, are you? I'm afraid so. It's the final touch. Stand up. Ruth. What's happening to me? Take it easy. It's those pills. It's those damn pills. I won't take any more of those pills! Don't worry about it. It's just a game. Just a game. I hope your protégé performs well this evening. He hasn't had much time. - He? - She hasn't had much time. We expect her to be a little awkward. I expect her to perform the duties of a maid. If not, she will be punished. But Dominita, she's never even worn heels before. And she's still very upset. You've had four days to train her. Surely that must be sufficient time for her to handle a simple dinner for two. You know I haven't had time to teach her to perform her duties. You're much too lenient, my dear Ruth. I see now that I'm going to have to take this matter into my own hands. Sit down. My my, how lovely you look this evening. Be careful, Ruth. I may get jealous of having someone so beautiful in the house. Continue with dinner, Rose. Where did you ever learn to serve from the right side of the guest? Service is always to the left unless circumstances prevent it. Now pick up those dishes and do it again correctly. Clumsy fool! Clean up this mess. Rose. The reason I corrected you is that wine should always be served before the meal. And always ask the hostess which wine she would prefer. Is that understood? Is that understood? Yes. Come back here. Let me see those nails. Disgraceful. Ruth, you are very lax. Don't let me see this girl's hands in this condition again. If she can't keep a nail, then give her false ones. You may go, Rose. You think that was brutal of me, don't you Ruth? Does it matter what I think? No. But, I will explain it to you anyway. You see, she needed that. In fact, she wanted it. Rose needs to be dominated. It took a traumatic situation like this to make her aware of it. I think we'll have no further trouble with Rose. That's very nice, Rose. I think you're going to enjoy your duties here. And Ruth will pay special attention to your training. Continue serving. Oh, isn't she lovely? I wonder where Dominita found her? I don't know. Dominita seems to have great luck in finding remarkable people. Uh oh, get ready. # ... to you # # Happy birthday Dominita # # Happy birthday to you # Thank you. Thank you very much. I only hope that all your birthdays will be as happy as you have made this one for me. Now enjoy yourselves, darlings. I'll be back in a short while. The usual, Jimmy. Excuse me, darling. Cathleen, I haven't seen you since the Bahamas. They dined on mince and slices of quince which they ate with a runcible spoon. And hand in hand, on the edge of the sand, they danced by the light of the moon. Aren't you Mr. Jacklum, the famous author? I am. I just finished reading your last book. And so have fifty thousand other little plebeians. Well, I certainly didn't mean to be facetious. My, you're a sweet young thing, aren't you? What part of North Carolina do you come from? Asheville, how did you know? Man propounds negotiations, man accepts the compromise. Very rarely will he squarely push the logic of a fact to its ultimate conclusion in unmitigated act. In other words, dear lady Run. Run for your life. Well, if it isn't my little playmates from the Bahamas. You and your girlfriends still picking pockets, or have you graduated to bigger game? Much bigger game. Delivering a prize package like you does great things for a girl's... financial and social status. You look great in that dress, darling. Don't you think you'd better get back to the guests? You can't accomplish anything for the big boss hanging around a client. Oh, Mr. Jacklum. On your way. Save the booze, baby. Save the booze. Why, thank you. How kind of you. I saw what your friend did. He's no friend of mine. I've never seen that guy before in my life. Men can be such clumsy louts. How true. Oh, I'm afraid your glove got wet. Here, let me take it off. Thank you. You have lovely hands. Why, thank you. As a matter of fact, you're the most... one of the most beautiful women I've ever seen. Are you an actress? No, nothing quite as exciting as that. Are you married? Not now. Maybe that's why that clumsy man upset me so. I think I've had my fill of men for a while. I know just what you mean. Stupid fool! She'll ruin everything. Oh Val, may I see you a minute please? You'll excuse me my dear, won't you? Stupid fool. Haven't you learned anything yet? - Don't call the girl before you establish a rapport. - I didn't call her. Don't dispute my word. Don't dispute my word. Be careful. We need this girls. Be careful. We need this girls. Oh Rose. I have someone I want you to meet. Mr. Nap, this is maid, Rose Albert. Rose, say hello to Mr. Nap. How do you do? Let's put it plain words, poopsy. You want the plans You want the plans and you're willing to pay fifty big ones and you're willing to pay fifty big ones if I can deliver. Right? if I can deliver. Right? Right. When can we trade these little goodies? Right. When can we trade these little goodies? Tomorrow, 5:30, my hotel. I'll send the money in small bills. Don't send, baby. Bring. And as long as you're hedging, kiddo I'll take something on the count now. I'll meet you later at Dominita's beach house. At the beach house. Well of course, I always go to the ballet. You know, where we used to live in Germany You know, where we used to live in Germany it was too far to go to Berlin for the really good ones. it was too far to go to Berlin for the really good ones. In fact, the Duke and I In fact, the Duke and I usually sit around the castle and drink beer. usually sit around the castle and drink beer. I understand the Duke is I understand the Duke is beginning to work in plastic explosives. beginning to work in plastic explosives. Where in the world did you hear that? Why did you do that? You knew who that was. You knew it would upset me. I know. It was a test. The supreme test. Even your commanding officer didn't recognize you because you look so much like a woman. And if he can't recognize you, no one can. Tears? A woman's tears? I can't help myself. Why? What makes me this way? It's you, Rose. The real you. Let me get out of this first. I miss you. - What if Dominita should see us? - She won't. She's in town. I haven't been alone with you for over a month. We gotta get out of here. We gotta get out of here. I can't stand it any longer. I can't stand it any longer. Look honey. I know what I am, but I can handle it. I can see a doctor, and he can help me understand what's happened to me. Then I can live like a human being. If I need to dress up, I can do it at home. No one but you would ever know. You love me, don't you? Yes, I love you. I mean, I think I love you. What does that mean? I mean, I think I'm in love with you but... I don't know which you. I'm afraid I only love you as Rose. I'm not sure I could love you as a man. What? Listen, I've never told you what Dominita uses to keep me here. Well, tell me. Right. Let me tell from the beginning. My family's very wealthy, and I was sheltered as a girl. Proper young lady and all that. I had a governess when I was about ten who was terribly affectionate. I mean, she fondled me a great deal. I don't know what it meant to her exactly, but I... I was very aroused by it. Then she left, and I forgot about it. I never saw much of boys, except formally. I didn't really mind. I hated my father, and I didn't like boys very much. I was very attached to my mother. She was soft... frail and very gentle. Well, anyway... when I graduated from high school I went to finishing school. A very exclusive women's college in the east. I was lost. I just couldn't seem to get close to anyone. Finally I started dating a boy from Laughton Finally I started dating a boy from Laughton and then we became lovers. and then we became lovers. I didn't enjoy it at all. I didn't enjoy it at all. He was so insensitive. He was so insensitive. Well, what's the matter, Ruth? Don't you like me? I do, Bill. Very much. Well, come on then. Well, come on then. Kissing you is like kissing a sack of potatoes. Kissing you is like kissing a sack of potatoes. What's with you anyhow? What's with you anyhow? Why do you go out with me? Why do you go out with me? Just so you have something to talk about with the girls back at the dorm? Just so you have something to talk about with the girls back at the dorm? No. No. I like you, but... I just don't feel anything. So I don't turn you on. So what? There are plenty of other girls around. Maybe if you'd give me some time I could... I could get to like kissing you. I could get to like kissing you. Have you seen me? Have you seen me? What are you talking about? What are you talking about? You haven't kissed me yet. You haven't kissed me yet. You haven't kissed me yet. You sit over there, you don't let me touch you. You sit over there, you don't let me touch you. You sit over there, you don't let me touch you. And you expect to experience great passions like in the movies. And you expect to experience great passions like in the movies. Oh, come on baby. Oh, come on baby. Like the man said, Like the man said, Sit back and enjoy yourself. Don't Bill, please don't. Don't Bill, please don't. I said relax, baby. Relax. I said relax, baby. Relax. Relax, come on. I was confused and unhappy. I thought I would kill myself. And then I met Sandra. Sandra was... I dunno... She reminded me of my mother. It's pretty obvious, isn't it? Go on. Well, Sandra was warm... and tender and... she made me very happy. We became intimate. I'm not ashamed of it. I loved her. How did Dominita get in on it? Well, Sandy had some friends who were wild and... they were acquainted with Dominita. One of them set us up and... Dominita got the pictures and tapes Dominita got the pictures and tapes just the way she got them of your father. just the way she got them of your father. - So you came with her? - Yes. She threatened to show them to my mother, I couldn't stand that. I would just die if my mother ever knew. I would just die if my mother ever knew. It would hurt her so. It would hurt her so. It would hurt her so. But how'd you explain this absence all this time? But how'd you explain this absence all this time? I told my parents I was going abroad. I told my parents I was going abroad. I write them letters occasionally I write them letters occasionally and Dominita has them mailed from Europe. I see. I think I love you. I've been happy with you as a man I've been happy with you as a man but maybe if you didn't... look the way you do, it wouldn't work. but maybe if you didn't... look the way you do, it wouldn't work. I think it would. Look, how did you like me when we first met, when I was Albert? I liked you very much, even then. I think it was the passiveness in me that you liked. The feminine side of my nature. I still have that, I always will. But, I don't think it makes any big difference physically what I am. We both can get help. Will you try? How, if Dominita won't let us go? What can we do? She's gotta have a weakness. We'll find it. She's gotta have a weakness. We'll find it. It may take time, but we'll do it. It may take time, but we'll do it. We'll start right away. We'll start right away. We'll go through the files first, and work from there. We'll go through the files first, and work from there. I love you. I don't care what you are. The key isn't here. The key isn't here. I knew she wouldn't leave it here over night. I knew she wouldn't leave it here over night. I knew she wouldn't leave it here over night. It's no use without the key, let's get out of here. It's no use without the key, let's get out of here. Rose, will you come to my bedroom? Come in, Rose. You rang, Dominita? I have to go out for a while. I have to go out for a while. By the time I get back, I want to see this room straightened out.
