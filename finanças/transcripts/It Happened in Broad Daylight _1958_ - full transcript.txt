IT HAPPENED IN BROAD DAYLIGHT Someone needs to stop Clearway Law. Public shouldn't leave reviews for lawyers. - Hi, Jacquier. Awful weather, right? - Good day. - Kirsch. - Coming right up. Thank you. Another one. - Where is the telephone? - There. Cantonal Police? Dr. Matth?i, please. This is an emergency! Dr. Matth?i, Jacquier here. You know me, Doctor. Something terrible has happened. I've found a dead child. - Where are you? - In M?gendorf, in Lions inn. Stay there. I will come right away. Hello? And don't drink anything. Your ticket to Amman. You're flying from Kloten airport via Athens. - The day after tomorrow. 12.40 pm. - Thank you. I'm so happy for you. I'm not happy for myself though. I will miss your stupid face, too. Alert the police records department, Lt. Henzi and the medical examiner. Probable death in M?gendorf. And my raincoat. Lt. Henzi, please start the alarm. - Everyone was alerted. - Call the M?gendorf police. Cantonal Police. M?gendorf is on the line. Police constable Kunz. - Ask him if it's raining in M?gendorf? - If it's raining? Ask him. Lt. Matth?i would like to know whether it rains in M?gendorf. - It pours. - Damn. Kunz, Matth?i here. Do exactly as I say. Go to the Lions inn. You will find peddler Jacquier there. Maybe you know him. Don't talk to him and don't anybody else either. I will be there in half an hour. It pours... - Where is Lt. Henzi? - He's already in the car. Let's go then. - What are you drinking? - Nothing, thank you. I'm here on business. - What have you done again? - Don't talk to him! You can't leave. I just want to see, if Dr. Matth?i is coming, constable. He will come. Sit down. - Doctor! It was by accident... - Get in. Now show us, what you had found in the forest. A policeman never looks away, Weber. Take a picture of the little dress, too. I found it by accident. By accident. - A doll is lying there. - Don't touch it! Send the children away. Close it off! - Close the whole area! - Pass it on! Kunz, do you know this girl? - I've seen here around in the village. - Someone wants to talk to you, Doctor. It's the teacher. - Bring him here. - Yes, commissioner. - Well, Doctor? - A very sharp knife. Probably a razor. Search again in the shrubs and there under the fir. Check the buttons for fingerprints? It's hopeless after the cloudburst. - Dear god, dear god. - Do you know this girl? - Gritli Moser. - Where do the parents live? In Riedbach. A quarter of an hour from here. - Is she one of your pupils? - Miss Krumm's, 2. class. - Do Moser's have any other children? - Gritli was an only child. Someone must tell the parents. Don't think I'm a coward, but I'd rather not do it. - That's alright, sir. - I can't do it. Then I have to do it myself again. - What do you want? - Lt. Matth?i, Cantonal Police. - Mr. Moser? - Yes. - What do you want? - Did you send Gritli anywhere? To her grandmother in Fehrden. Did something happen to Gritli? - Did she often go that way? - Every Wednesday and Saturday afternoon. Why? What happened? Gritli was found dead in the forest near M?gendorf. Gritli was murdered. That's impossible. - There can't be such a devil. - There are such devils, Mr. Moser. - I have to go to my child. - It's better not to go. Why is it better? You can see her tomorrow evening. She will look like she's sleeping then. Who... killed her? We will find out, Mr. Moser. - Can you promise me that? - Yes, Mrs. Moser. On your honor? I promise you, Mrs. Moser. Murderer! Bastard! Beast! Monster! - Hand us the guy! - Clear the place, please! - What are you waiting for? - Are you going to shoot my people? Don't let them provoke you! I tell you the last time to clear the place! You're the Mayor, right? Give us a free passage! - So I can help the guy? Never! - Then I hold you responsible! Me? You should hold that peddler responsible! - Yes, out with him! - Give him up! - Should I call for reinforcement? - Too late. Jacquier is the murderer. I saw him! Nobody else was in the valley! That's it! We will bring him out! Listen, people! We're prepared to give you the peddler. We understand you. We're just as horrified. Many of us have children, too. Only a monster could do this. Yet he must appear harmless. Prove, that Jacquier did it. Then you can have him. - On what do you base your suspicion? - I saw him in the valley. - He was hanging about around midday! - Come forward. Go, Heiri. Don't be a coward. - What is your name? - I'm Benz Heiri. - What do you want from me? - You saw Jacquier in the valley. - Who else did you see? - Nobody. - What time did you arrive in the valley? - At 10. I was planting potatoes. - So you saw nobody else? - Nobody! I swear. - Benz, I came by your potato field at 2 pm. - Me, too. I was there too with my cart. But you always work like crazy. Strange. So others came by too, without being noticed. Should we kill those three, too? Everyone who was in the valley! And you too! Do you have anything else to say against the peddler? Any other proof of his guilt? If he proves innocent, you would have committed murder. Leave him to us. I think, we can do it better. We have other means to find out the truth. I would have been dead now. Without you I would have been dead, Doctor. Give him a cigarette. I'm innocent. I really am innocent! Nobody believes me. And you don't either. Nonsense. Terrible. I'm sorry you have to concern yourself with such a terrible incident on your last day. - That's our profession. - Who would be the best to take over? - I think, Henzi. - Is he experienced enough? We've been working together for 3 years. He knows his job. Maybe he lacks instinct, but that will come with time. - It's a shame you're leaving right now. - Everyone is replaceable. Send Henzi in, please. But you don't smoke. Are you looking forward to your new position down there in the desert? You will reorganize the police there splendidly. Anyway you fit in better with the Arabs, than with us, Zurich people. - They're probably just as stubborn as you. - That's why I took the position. - How long is your contract? - Five years. - Commander. - Sit down. A cigar? Thank you, I prefer cigarettes. Do you have any assumptions, concerning the murderer? The murder weapon was a razor. Two girls were killed with the same weapon 5 years ago and 2 years ago in cantons of St. Gallen and Schwyz. I think it's the same killer. I find it improbable though that the killer is from M?gendorf. - What do you think, Matth?i? - The same. This is your case now. Keep me posted. - Thank you, commander. - You should thank him. What will you do next, Henzi? I will demand an alibi from all convicted sexual offenders. The manhunt has already begun. It can't be so urgent that I had to be pulled out of the theater... Cantonal Police. Again? So you'd like to know, what I was doing yesterday. - No, what you were doing today. - Today... - I'm at your disposal. - Would you like to talk with me alone? I will stay with my husband. So I should go through all this laundry, to find a blood stain? - Just because one rascal killed another? - A child was murdered. A 8-year-old girl. - Three man should search the edge of the forest. - Yes, constable. Did you find anything? I thought you might still come around, Doctor. - I can't just drop it. - Feller! Show the Doctor what we'd found. The comb belongs to Jacquier. For sure. The farmers believe he's the killer. What do you think, Doctor. Maybe the farmers are right. You're a man of land yourself, Henzi. You have to agree with the farmers. - Have you interrogated the villagers yet? - We found nothing. I'm going to school now. Come with me, Doctor. I can't go alone, not one single step. Where thou shall go and stay, take me along. Miss Krumm, Lt. Henzi from Cantonal Police. - Are you Gritli Moser's teacher? - Yes. - Good day, children. - Good day. - You sang that beautifully. - We're practicing for Gritli's funeral. - The low voices are still not good. - What kind of child was Gritli? - We all loved her. - Was she intelligent? - She had a vivid imagination. - I have some questions for the children. You have heard, what had happened to Gritli Moser. I'm with the Police. I won't treat you like children but like adults. A man, a very bad man, killed Gritli. There are such bad men. They lure children into their lairs, into woods, basements or cars. Whatever hidden places there are. And sometimes such a man can hurt a child so bad, that he has to die. That happened to Gritli. That's why we have to put these people to jail. Now you ask me, why don't we do this, before the disaster happens? We can't do this, because we don't recognize these people. So there is just one thing to do, never follow a stranger! Never go with people you don't know. Now you have to help me. We have to find Gritli's killer. Listen! Did Gritli say anything about any strangers talking to her lately? Was she obsessed with anything new lately. - Who was Gritli's best friend. - I was. - What is your name? - Ursula Fehlmann. So you were Gritli's friend. - We were sitting together. - You have to speak louder. - You don't remember anything peculiar? - No. Gritli didn't meet anybody? - Yes, she did. - Who? - Won't you answer? - A giant. A giant... Ursula, you shouldn't lie to the police. I'm not lying. Gritli met a giant. Gritli Moser liked to tell fairytales That wasn't a fairytale. Gritli really met a giant. You mean to say, she met a tall man. No. My father is tall, too, but he's no giant. So, how tall was he? Like a hill and black all over. Gritli said he was a hedgehog-giant. - And he gave Gritli a hedgehog. - A hedgehog? Yes, a small hedgehog. That's a lovely story. But I still think it's a fairytale. No, it's not a fairytale. Gritli even drew a picture. Gritli often drew fairytales. She was a poetic child. I'd like to practice the final choral now. The children still don't sing well enough. Well, that's probably all for now. - Goodbye, Ursula. Please don't be mad. - But she never lied to me. Even if it is a fairytale, she hadn't lied to you. You should always believe in fairytales. Especially one so young as you. - Goodbye children. - Goodbye. That wasn't a fairytale. - So, this will be Henzi's office. - Yes, chief. I've packed the sign, too. They need just a bit of water. The typing machine and a couple of books I have at home are yours. What will happen to me now, when you leave? What is this? Jacquier's pants were tested with benzidine. The report is in there. - The guy still won't confess. - Who? The peddler. - Lengthy interrogation? - It's been two hours. So you comfortably lied down on the edge of the forest and had lunch. Yes, inspector. Otherwise you always eat at Lions when you come to M?gendorf. Yes, inspector. Why not yesterday? Because the postman told me, there is a new policeman in M?gendorf. I was afraid, inspector. My papers weren't in order. I'm also a new policeman. - Are you afraid of me, too? - Yes, inspector. - And that's why you didn't go into village? - Yes, inspector. And so you could calmly lie there and wait for the girl. - You waited for the girl. - I didn't wait for the girl. I didn't do it! I didn't do it! You said, you wanted to return through the forest to Zurich after the meal. I wanted to take the shortcut because of the rain. - And so you found the body. - Yes. - And you haven't touched it? - No. We took your clothes and gave you another. - Do you know why? - No, commissioner. To take a benzidine test. Do you know what that is? It's for detecting blood. We found blood on your pants. - It is girl's blood. - Because I tripped over her body! - It was terrible. - Why didn't you tell us that? And then you ran into the village to notify us. Yes, commissioner. About 80 m from the crime scene your basket got stuck into a blackthorn bush. Yes. The strange thing is, that the blackthorn lies in the opposite direction. We've found one of your combs in it. - So you ran back into the forest. - I lost my way out of fear. Lost? A couple of steps from the edge of the forest? That seems to me rather unlikely. - Everything is unlikely. - There could be another explanation. After he killed the girl, he ran away and into the blackthorn. Then he remembered, the postman had seen him and he can't disappear unnoticed. So you decided to go to M?gendorf to report the crime yourself, so you could act innocent. But I didn't meet the girl. I didn't do it. I'm not a murderer. - Believe me! - Take it easy. We don't want to torture you. We're just trying to find the truth. - Would you like some coffee? - Thank you. Say, you sell all sort of things, right? Toothbrushes, toothpastes, soap, shaving cream, razor blades. What brand? - Gillette. - What else do you sell? - Kitchen knives. - What else? - Razors. - Razor was the murder weapon. You're silent. As a peddler you go through many regions, right? Yes. Was your previous permission valid also for Canton of Schwyz? Yes. And did also pass through Canton of St. Gallen? - Not in a long time. - Two years ago? I don't know. Maybe. Because two years ago there was another girl there murdered with a razor. And five years ago in Canton of Schwyz. You did it, Jacquier. It came over you like madness. And when you came to, you were terrified. You wanted to give yourself up in M?gendorf. But you lost the courage. The courage to confess. You have to find that courage again. And we want to help you find it. I can't confess to something I haven't done. I can't. I can't. I have to get changed for the farewell party this evening. Yes? Thank you, Doctor. The medical examiner reported, they'd found chocolate in child's stomach. We found half a Lindt chocolate bar in your bag. Doctor Matth?i, I'm innocent! Bring two dinners from the canteen. Serve coffee. Dr. Matth?i won't speak long. ... be honest even at farewell, although people tend to lie then. I'm leaving and I'm not sure, I will return again. Because I will settle down in a corner of the world with a better climate. But I didn't want to part, before expressing my fear, that our world might be a bit too perfect. So perfect, that we almost don't need each other anymore. Everything is organized, runs smoothly, and we're stripped of the responsibility, which lies in ever more thickly woven net of laws, statutes and paragraphs. It's a bit sad, because that way everyone is... replaceable and doesn't leave any hole behind, when he leaves. And neither will I. Please forgive this melancholic goodbye but I owed you one. After all you must stay here. Feller called. I have to go back urgently. He hasn't confessed anything yet, but he wants to speak to you. Can you come? Maybe you will get a confession out of him. - Let's go. - But this is your party. Nobody will notice. I don't think I will come back either. You fail to see the situation you're in, Jacquier. What could happen to you? You're sick. Not physically. But you belong in an institution, where you will be treated. Or do you think you can go on like that? Do you think you can go free again, and in 1, 2, 3 years you get another urge, to kill another little girl? Should I wait 1, 2, 3 years, until the murderer kills another girl, until you believe me, I'm innocent? Dr. Matth?i! Dr. Matth?i! I have to speak with you, Doctor! Just you, please. Alone. Ok, we'll leave you. So, what is it? Only you can help me, Doctor, only you. Only me? I find it a bit odd, that you turn to me of all people. After all it is thanks to me, that you spent 3 months in jail last year. That's why. You found out the truth, despite me lying to you. I couldn't deceive you. You knew, I was the thief. And now also... You, Doctor, only you can find the truth. Otherwise I'm doomed. - I think he's innocent. - Innocent? How come? I didn't believe from the start, that he was the killer. What he says and how, his reactions... That is no killer. What would you like me to do? Stop the interrogation, and set him free, despite all the lies and inconsistencies. - I have a feeling. Purely personal. - That's the first time, I've heard you say "purely personal". But I know, what I have to do. I've learned my profession from you. It's not true! It's not true! How many times do you want me to repeat it? I'm innocent! Believe me! I'm just wondering, who will bring breakfast to your room from now on. An Arab. The main thing is, the coffee will be superb. You're not trying to say that you didn't like my coffee? - Truthfully, no. - And you tell me just now? - After so many years? - Well, you never asked me before. Come in. - Good morning, chief. - You look like hell. - I was up late, but it was worth it. - What is it? - Jacquier confessed. - In detail? - We will get to the details today. - Let's drive to the office. What do you say about Henzi? He proved very successful in his very first case. I don't want to disappoint you, but I believe Jacquier will withdraw his confession today. Maybe. Then we will try to persuade him again. Peddler hanged himself. He's dead. So the Gritli Moser case is closed. Doctor, keep in touch. Have a good flight. Give me a cigarette. - Hedgehogs. These are the hedgehogs. - Hey! Give back my truffles! - Miss, I'm getting off. - But we can't unload your luggage now. To M?gendorf! Quickly! And so we commit Gritli Moser to the ground. But Jesus said, "Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven." Truffles... Truffles... Truffles... So, Doctor. It seems the farmers are not so dumb. There'll be a long trial and the peddler will live on state expenses for years. The farmers could have spared you that. The man hanged himself this morning. Nice. So what are you still doing here? The case is then closed. - I'm here on personal matter. - Personal? Please leave the classroom then. Otherwise I will hold you responsible. Based on a child's drawing you believe the hedgehogs to be truffles. And because of that you break a contract and don't fly to Jordan. I ask you to give me back the Gritli Moser case. How can I do that, Dr. Matth?i? You're not with us anymore. If we take you back, it means, we permit you to break a contract. Then please reopen the case yourself. Your truffles are so contrary to all the evidence, that it's pure amateurism to believe in Jacquier's innocence. Commander, on the airport there were children. If I'm right, the killer is free and those children are in danger. Children are always in danger, Matth?i. In Germany there are over 15 000 sexual offences against children per year. This is not about statistics! If I'm right, another child will die! "If", Matth?i. But this "if" is so unlikely, it doesn't justify further investigation. I couldn't account for it to the state. Then I will take the case privately. That is absurd. You're overtired, nervous. Take a couple weeks off. You will see things differently then. Leave this unfortunate case alone. The Gritli Moser case is closed. - I will find the killer. - As you wish. That is now your private matter. - You can't expect any help from us. - I know. Can I make a call, please? Go ahead. Miss, Matth?i here. Make me an appointment for this afternoon with our psychiatrist, Prof. Manz. Thank you. Take your truffles. - Where is your luggage? - In Jordan. In Jordan? I see. I will make an appointment. Please, have a sit. Please. - Hello, Hans. - Good day, Robert. - Sit down. - Thank you. Do you smoke? Not really. But you suddenly do. - Need a light? - No, thank you, don't bother. - Nervous? - A little bit. You don't get enough sleep. - Commander probably called you. - Yes. - What did he say? - He suggested, you were overworked and asked me to help you, as much as I can. Actually I think it's nice. But that's not why I'm here. Not yet. Are you familiar with the Gritli Moser case? What I've read in the papers. I believe Gritli drew her killer. - You don't believe Jacquier did it? - No. So why did the poor devil hang himself? Because he was old, lonely, lost, weak... - What do I know? - And what did you want from me? The child's drawing is the only lead I have. But I'm like an amateur staring at the x-ray. I can't interpret this drawing. You're a psychiatrist. With your knowledge of Gritli Moser's murder what can you tell from the drawing. That's what I want to know. Two coffees and I don't want to be disturbed. It's a mix of fantasy and reality. Some parts of the drawing are real. The tall man, the car, the girl. Everything else is a kind of cipher. The hedgehog, which you think is a truffle. The beetle or what is this? An animal with horns. And the Kasperle puppet, which seems particularly absurd. - Tell me about the giant. - He stands there, tall, huge. By the look of it quite possible. Robust, prone to violence... And towards women... Inferiority complex etc. The date of the drawing is interesting: a week before the murder. Gritli must have met her killer at least once before the crime. Strange, that she told about her encounter like a fairytale. Why? Children do nothing without a reason. Probably the giant forbade to talk about their secret encounters and the poor little thing obeyed. She told the fairytale instead of the truth. That's diabolical. - Was the girl violated? - No. Then the killer probably acted out of hate towards women. The killer wanted to take revenge against women through this murder. - A girl is not a woman, Robert. - But she can substitute one. What he doesn't dare with women, he dares with little girls. He murdered her instead of a woman. He will almost always approach the same type of girls. I'm almost certain, that his victims are alike. Yes, I've seen the photos. The girls who were murdered in cantons of St. Gallen and Schwyz years ago, were the same type. They even looked alike. The encircled one is Gritli Moser. Drink, inspector. This must disgust you. What else can you tell me about the killer? It doesn't take much. In certain mental state, a bit altered metabolism, a few degenerated cells, and the man is a beast. - These are sick people. - They're sick to you doctors, Robert. To us they're criminals, who we must stop. Revenge, you say. And the reason for the revenge? Maybe sexual conflicts. Maybe his wife oppresses or exploits him. Maybe his wife is rich and he's poor. Maybe she is socially above him. Even the most absurd is possible between husband and wife. - Will he kill again? - Unfortunately. He will find it harder and harder to fight his urges and the intervals between murders will be shorter and shorter. - What's happening inside of him. - After the act, relief. But in short time a new hatred gathers. Then he carefully drives around in his car and searches for a new victim. When he finds her, he befriends her again, until it happens again. Another thing. In my experience this man most probably doesn't have any small children. Otherwise he couldn't do such things. That's all, I can tell you. Thank you. I suddenly have a feeling, I know this man. - And how will you find him? - That's what I still have to discover. With a normal murder the motives lead to suspects. Who gains benefit, who is the enemy, who is jealous? We find leads. But with a pointless murder... He strikes and disappears without a trace. Don't get carried away with this. Or you will become obsessed. Then you'll come back some day. As a patient. Think about it. Maybe the giant exists only in poor Gritli's imagination. And you're chasing someone who doesn't ever exist. Right now it's enough for me that this man can exist. - What's with you again? - Nothing. Nice weather. Oh, so you've noticed. Of course you're going to loiter again. But you're sending me to Zurich. It's your business. It takes 4 hours to Zurich and back. And they don't keep you long in depot either. But you always stay the whole day. You drive there, waste gas, spend money and do nothing useful! And at night mister stays in his room and acts sick! I'm not sick! I feel fine. Like never before. The family lived there. They moved after the murder. Since then the house is empty. Nobody wants to live there. - It's been 5 years already. - Where did it happen? Back there. Where the road leads into the forest. In the forest. Always in the forest. And there's the road. - She was lying there, the poor thing. - So close to the road. It was summer, everything was green. You couldn't see through, like you can now. It was the most terrible crime in Canton of St. Gallen in 25 years. Close to the road. In all three cases. Goodbye. Three crime scenes. All three are on the same way. The killer drives on this road. Where does this road go? To Graub?nden. A capricorn. Only cars from Graub?nden have a capricorn on the license plate. That could be a capricorn. Children, come here! Come here. - What are your names? - Ruthli and Peter. - Can you draw? - It depends what. - Peter can draw airplanes. - I'd like you to draw a capricorn. Look, up there is one. In Graub?nden coat of arms. That's a capricorn. You could draw one for me, right? Very good, children. If you said those were ants, I would have believed you. Come. Good day. Fill it up. - What is the knife for, protection? - It's for peeling potatoes. - Don't you have anyone to help you? - Who will help a poor Italian? People! And that? No! And climate! All the cars drive past! To Italy! I'd like to go back, but I can't. - 12.50. - It's fine. - Thank you. Is this the only road between Graub?nden and Zurich? Is it not enough? Where would you put another one? Mountains left and right. - I'm still here. - So I see. - Can I sit? - Please. There. - I'd like to talk business with you. - I'm not buying anything. Listen. You want to go to Italy. I will rent the garage for 3 months. Three months? - But it's not cheap. - How much? 3000. 2500! 2000! 1500! 1000! - Is a village nearby? - Four kilometers from here. - Come with me to the notary now. - What do you need this place for anyway? I have to meet somebody. Here? On the road. Did you catch anything? Sure, a grayling. But I threw it back. I'm only interested in trouts. Then I suggest you catch a trout. - You don't have a clue about fishing? - Can you tell? - Look, bread. What can you catch with that? - I don't know. You could catch a common whitefish, because it's vegetarian - And a trout? - A trout is a predator. You can catch it only with live bait. A fly, a worm or a small fish. With live bait. Good day, I'm the new tenant of the gas station up there. I'd like to buy some things. Here's the list. - What's the matter? - The child there... I knew a girl once who looked exactly like her. Good day. Who are you then? - Annemarie. - How old are you? - I'm almost 7. - Then you must be in school already? - Of course, in the first class. - Are you a doctor? - Why? Are you sick? - Broken arm. She's also Annemarie. - Yes, you're right. Annemarie should see a doctor. Because that hurts. - Where do you live? - There. With mommy. - With mommy and daddy? - No daddy. - Is your mommy home? - No. She doesn't come back before 6. I'm looking for someone who can help me. A housekeeper. - I wouldn't take her. - Why not? She has a bad reputation. Anyway she was never married. The poor child. She's always alone. The women don't want their children to play with her. - That's how it is in a small village. - I can imagine. - Say, where does the woman work? - In the paper factory next to the mill. Thank you. There comes mommy. My name is Matth?i. May I speak with you? Yes, come. What do you need from me? I've rented the old house with gas station up there on the road. I'm alone. I'd like to hire you as a housekeeper. Maybe you could help me with the gas station too. Of course you could live there with your child. I'd pay you well. - I don't know. I work in the factory. - 8 hours a day, right? Yes, but no hard work. Mommy! I've watched her little doll this afternoon. We spoke. Annemarie was very kind. But she seems a bit sad, serious, a bit lonely. That's not very good for a child. At my place she would have more of her mother. - Don't you think so. - What about school? - The road is 4 kilometers away. - I've thought about that. I could bring her to school and back. Why did you choose me? - Because you were recommended. - Me, recommended? Yes. I was told you're a single woman, who works and does everything for her child. I was recommended? My name is Heller. Mrs. Heller. - Where does the tower go? - Tower? It has no tower. - But it must have a tower. - No, that's not modern anymore. - Today houses don't have towers anymore. - I'd like to have a tower. Well, of course it will have a small tower, too. Here comes the fence... until here... Fence. And then I can take a stroll with Annemarie in it. Mr. Matth?i! Mr. Matth?i! He wants 50 liters. But I don't know where is the tank? We will find that out. - Do you know him? - No, I just thought... Let's find out if he has any children. Is this municipal administration? This is about an inheritance. Attorney Huegi here. In your municipality there is Mr. Friedrich Kramer. Yes. According to my information he's not married. So, he has three small children. Then he's surely not the right one. Yes. Please, forgive me. Yes, good evening, Mr. Meier. The father of little Fritz here. My wife tell me, that our children went to the cinema together. Sorry? Oh, he's only year and a half old. I must have made a mistake then. He couldn't have gone to the cinema then. Yes. I'm sorry. Yes, yes... Would you like... Should I bring coffee up here or... Did you eavesdrop, Mrs. Heller? I didn't eavesdrop, I just overheard. I'm looking for a man without children. That I know. He can't have small children. You don't owe me an explanation. I will take my coffee downstairs, Mrs. Heller. - Good day, Mr. Matth?i! - Good day, vicar. I'm so glad that you take care of Mrs. Heller and Annemarie. They were so lonely. I'm glad to have them. But you don't seem happy. You worry about something, right? - Can I do anything to help you? - No, nobody can. Vicar, I feel like a fool. I wait for something and sometimes I think, that I'm waiting for something that may not happen. I don't know what you're waiting for, but maybe it has a reason it doesn't come. The things we desire, are sometimes not the things we hope for, but... something terrible. I'm also waiting for something terrible. - Gas. - Normal? - Super. - It was almost full. - How much? - 4.80. Annemarie! Annemarie! Come. Come here, please. - I don't want you to play down there. - But Sleeping Beauty's castle is there. There is no Sleeping Beauty's castle. I mean... at least not down there. Why the stupid smile? I'm not smiling. May I take another piece? - I have to go to Zurich again tomorrow. - Why? How come? They ran out of bottle labels. They have to send out 500 bottles tomorrow. Why didn't you bring them today? I didn't know it then. I'll go! Yes. But I have children. Franz and Albert! They're not here. Why, what have they done? Then I don't understand why you're calling. You're welcome. - What was that? - It doesn't concern you. They're not you children. Well. - Mrs. Heller, where is Annemarie? - She went to buy bread. You shouldn't have sent her. I told you, I could drive... I know. But I forgot to put it on the list today. - I don't like it, Mrs. Heller. - But she's not so little anymore. - It's good for the child. - I still don't like it, Mrs. Heller. Hello. Are you a magician? Yes, a great magician. Dear magician, please do some more magic. - What would you like? - A castle like the Sleeping Beauty's. With many towers. Well, not today. Maybe tomorrow? - Will you come again? - Every day. If you will do magic. I will. For sure. But... - You can't tell anybody. - Nobody? Nobody! If you tell anyone I can't do magic. I won't tell anybody, for sure. I swear. Good girl. Hello! - Commissioner Matth?i. - Well, if it isn't the Woodpecker. - Nice new car. Already paid for? - Everything is in order. The last time... - How much? - 8000. - I mean how much gas? - At your discretion, commissioner. - Business is bad. Full? - As you wish, commissioner. So you moved your operations from Canton of Zurich to Graub?nden now? - But commissioner! - Zurich is probably too hot for you? 16.80. It's fine. I'm sorry! It just slipped out. No problem. A tip is always welcome. Should I clean the window, too? And when I have all the pictures, I'll get a pile of chocolate. So big. - Have you finished your homework? - I will after supper. You have to go to sleep after supper. Now. Uncle Matth?i? Do you know what is 4 x 7? - I do, but do you? - Yes. But I want you to say it. - Nothing doing. - Please! - Miss Heller, what is 2 x 7? - 14. Great. What is 3 x 7? - 21. - Great. Now can you tell me, Miss Heller, what is 21 + 7? 27. - Shame on you, stupid girl. - Well, she was almost right. - Everybody can make a mistake. - 28! Great, Miss Heller. The man I have in mind is married and has 2 small children. No children. I've read in the phone book he's an agent for a engine factory. Oh, chocolate factory. Then it's not him. Please forgive me. Well. 24 ANIMAL FAIRYTALES Annemarie was gluing some pictures today. Did you give her those pictures? No, a man gave them to her. She told me so. - A man? When was that? - Today. What did she tell you? Why didn't you tell me, you were with the police? Because I'm with the police no more. And because it doesn't concern you, Mrs. Heller. Mr. Matth?i! Every evening these phone conversations. You always ask about children. What is that about? - Nothing. - I'm afraid. But I'm not afraid for me. What do you want from my daughter? You don't have to be afraid for Annemarie. I have some business early in the morning. Please tend to the gas station. I will return by noon. - Good night. - Good night. Lively, right? We're now in Graub?nden, where we drink and celebrate. - Can I get some coffee? - No, not while we're having wine! I just need some information. It's regarding an old friend. The chocolate agent Wonder. Does he still come here? Do you know, what the gentleman wants to know? Where he could find Wonder! In bed. Your friend Wonder got married yesterday afternoon. That's why we have gathered here. - He gave a child some pictures and... - He gave pictures to all the children he met out of happiness. He gave away heaps. Give some wine here! But I haven't had breakfast yet. Can't I get some coffee first? He hasn't drunk his coffee yet, his coffee yet, his coffee yet! He hasn't drunk his coffee yet, his coffee yet! He hasn't drunk his coffee yet, his coffee yet! So give him now some coffee please, some coffee please, some coffee please! So give him now some coffee please, some coffee please! Annemarie! Come here! - Why aren't you in school? - There is no school today. - No school? Where were you? - In the village. I don't believe you. I saw you. You came from the forest there. - I was in the village. - Come, hop in! - Who gave you chocolate? - A girl. Hop in! Show me! Do you have any more? Why are you lying? - Who gave you the chocolate? - I told you. A girl? A girl you played with? - Yes. - Fine. Now come. We will drive to the girl. And you will show me, where you played. You don't want to come? Annemarie. Won't you tell me the truth now? Did a man give you chocolate? A tall man? Look, you must tell me now, who gave you the chocolate. I knew a girl like you once. A tall man gave her chocolate, which looked like little hedgehogs. Then she went into the forest with the tall man. And then the tall man hurt the girl very badly. You're lying. You must tell me the truth! Nothing bad can happen to you! - I like you very much! - I like the magician. A magician gave you the chocolate? I can't tell you, or he won't be able to do magic tomorrow. Yes... Then you shouldn't tell anybody about it. Go to your room now. - Where does he do his magic? - In the forest. Thank you. 91... 91, 91, 91... 91, 91... 9149. Schrott! What's wrong? Pack your things, I'm taking you back to your house right now. Take your child, too. Don't let her out of your sight. - What is this? - I don't want to discuss it now. I want you to tell me what's going on. I have a right. It's my child! You have to leave, because I can't put Annemarie's life in danger anymore. Anymore? You put my child's life in danger? Annemarie received chocolate from a strange man. I'm sure it's the same man, who some months ago lured a girl into the forest... and killed her. Dr. Matth?i, did you take Annemarie and me in your house, so you could find this killer? Yes! I didn't plan it this way, but I made a mistake. You can't watch over a child constantly, like I'd imagined. Annemarie ran into the killer without my knowledge. I don't even know how many times. It's pure luck, that nothing had happened. - So Annemarie was a bait? - I had to find the killer! That was the only way to lure him into a trap. And he fell right into it. Do you know that this child likes you? Chocolate wrappers. She's the boss. He only gets pocket money. The sons are from her first marriage. Yes, I knew the gentleman, before he was a gentleman. He was a servant. He wasn't so fat then either. Mr. Schrott buys just one kind of chocolate here, our special truffles. Matth?i here. I'd like to speak to the commander. In Basel? Is Lt. Feller there? Then give me Weber, his assistant. Hello, Weber? Yes, it's me. Listen, my boy. What I will tell you now, you have to report to Feller right away. It's very important and urgent. Take a pencil and write down... I'll take away your car keys. Then you can stay at home. Enough with the driving and money spending. That's all you ever have on your mind! Money! Always money! My money! When I was still your chauffeur, I cost you more! You were also more useful! You son of a bitch! Oh, god. Hello, magician! - Be quiet! Keep still! - Hello, magician! The child mustn't see this! Magician, where are you? Hello, magician! Annemarie! Annemarie! Mommy, I'm here!
