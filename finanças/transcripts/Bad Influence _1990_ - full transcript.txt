He's in a meeting, Michael. Do you know that the third quarter Schedule-47 is gone? It's 60 million in currency purchases outlined, and it's gone. - It was a pleasure. - See you later. Count on it. Hey. What's going on? Schedule-47 is off the computer. Well, did you check the backup file? Gone. Both gone. Geez. Well, I'm sorry. I... I... I wish I could help you, Michael. No, I'm sorry. No, I just can't believe that... Well, if you didn't get it done in time, I suppose I can get Howard to pull me off what I'm doing to give you a hand. If you really want me to, that is, but, you know, it doesn't look too good. You know, the only people that have access to that file are me and Leslie, Britt and you. If you're trying to say something, why don't you just come out and say it? Oh, Michael, did... did, uh... Did you find it? No calls, Marie. Oh, Michael, your um, uh... Michael? Just can't believe... Forget it was Thursday? Oh, Jesus. You scared me. Sorry. Are you ready for lunch? I have to get back. Oh, lunch. Jesus. - I'm... - You're not gonna cancel? No, I just have... Think I should cancel dinner with my parents tomorrow night? No! No, no, no. No. Of course not. No, I wanna do that. - I know they're kind of a drag... - Yeah. But they have been sweet about the wedding arrangements. Yeah. Yeah. Which reminds me, I'm having second thoughts. You are? Oh, God, that sounded terrible. No, I just meant that October might not be good for me. How's November for you? Fine. Um, November's fine. Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie. I didn't mean to scare you. No. Don't be silly. You didn't scare me. I absolutely, positively wanna get married. Mm. This year. And I absolutely, positively wanna have a baby, mm, next year. What is it, Michael? Oh, my stomach. I feel like I can't breathe sometimes. Just a stupid thing. Do you want me to call my father at the hospital? I'm f... No, I'm all right. - Better? - Yeah. Yeah. Oh, Michael, I know you better than you know yourself, and I just know these attacks of yours are work-related. You're not even 30, and you're gonna be named senior analyst. Someone is gonna be named senior analyst. Oh, you know it will be you. You're successful, for God's sake. Try to relax and enjoy it. All right. Yeah, you're right. If you're feeling better, I really gotta get back to the office. Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm fine. No, you should go. Okay. Michael, call me tonight? Sure. Yeah, that'd be f... That'd be good. Oh, Christ. Hi. What can I getcha? Bourbon and water. 2.75. I can't find my damned wallet. If you could wait just a minute, please. Here you go. Thanks. Looks like you've having the same kind of day I am. For your sake, I hope your clay is nothing like mine. Supposed to be at the office? Yeah. Shoulda gone to Disneyland. You know. When I was a kid, uh, I just wanted to get right off the boat in the middle of Pirates of the Caribbean, you know? Just live there. Son of a bitch! You can't just walk away from this, Claire. Not here. Okay? What's he lookin' at? Take it easy, Will. He's just some drip. Thank you. He just bought me a drink, okay? Why don't you take a hike, pal? Well, this is a public bar. I can have a drink here, can't I? Jesus, Willy, not again. You shoulda taken a hike, pal. Jesus, all right. Just let me go. Now it's too late. Let him go. Yeah, what are you gonna do? Let's find out. Come on. Let's get the hell outta here. Hi, sweetheart. I just wanna see if you're feeling better. Call me later, okay? Hello. Pismo. I have to ask you something. I'm coming over. Michael, it's Howard. Patterson seems to think there's some problem with your Schedule-47. Not true, is it? By the way, where were you this afternoon? When did you get this? Couple weeks ago. Why did you get this? I don't know. It was on sale. Do you need it? That's not the point. Better give it away to somebody. Cut your losses. You're not making any sense. Your life makes too much sense already. At this rate, you'll have a home espresso machine by the end of the year. Pismo, what did you say you had to ask me, 'cause I really gotta get going. What is the rush with you all the time? I left my wallet at the beach. Oh, better find your credit cards so you can charge some more video cameras. You needed to ask me something. Do you need to borrow money again, or...? Why do you immediately assume I need money? Do you? Yes. Fine. I'll write you a check. You know what really drives me nuts? You don't respect me. I'm your older brother, your only brother, and you don't respect me. - Stop with this. - It's true. I just think you could do better than sitting around your apartment smoking pot all day. That's all. Does that mean I have to just because I could? Who says I could, anyway? I couldn't get a decent job, to save my life, and you know perfectly well why. Look, it was eight years ago. Six months for possession. Nobody gives a damn. It was dealing, and those people never forget. Hey, I'm out there trying. Oh, God. Look, do we have to go through this every single time I loan you money? Look, come on. Uh, it's no big deal, all right? Come on. I'll call ya if your wallet turns up, but don't hold your breath, okay? Okay. - And that's my office. - Okay. - Okay. Thank you. - Okay. I know you didn't want me to, but I promised you something. It's just such a nightmare. It's taking a lot longer than I planned. You really don't have to. I want to. Please. You're so sweet. Hey. You're the guy, uh, from the bar, right? The guy with the bottle. Re... remember? I'm Michael. Why did you leave so fast? Didn't wanna stick around for the thank yous. Well, thank you, anyway. I'm... Do you live around here? No. Oh. Thank you, anyway. Why didn't you back down? - What? - In the bar. The guy told you to take a hike. Why didn't you? I don't know. I don't know. You know, that voice that you, uh... That tells you what to do sometimes? Guess I listened to it today. That sounds stupid, I suppose. I'm like that. And I always listen to him. I'm Alex. You wanna get a beer? He's a conniving son of a bitch, and he gets ahead. That pisses me off. Well. That's the way it works. - Yeah. - And he knows it. He pulled that stunt today to show you that he could, and that you'd let him. Well, I didn't exactly let him... But you didn't do a thing about it. It won't be a computer file next time. It'll be your biggest account. Or your girlfriend. And you won't do anything about that either. It's the same principle, it's just a bigger scale. He understands that. I like the guy. What's his name? Patterson. Patterson. Oh, you gotta be kidding me. No. Come on. To Patterson. To Patterson. What kind of man are you that you'd drink to your enemies? This isn't funny. There. Show Patterson that face. Beat him in his own game. Back it up. Uh, "Dominant athletic woman", right? I think you're really gonna like this band. Oh, well, I... I can't stay very long. I've gotta be up early. Come on. I get the feeling you don't get out so much. Dominant athletic woman. Okay. - Hi. - Right on. Who is this band? Nymphs. Nymphs. ♪ What's inside an evil man's eyes ♪ ♪ And I just have to know ♪ ♪ What's inside a stranger's eyes ♪ ♪ I just had to know ♪ Gentlemen, what can I do for you? Drink?

Hey, listen, can I get two of whatever she's drinking? All right. Shit. My wallet. Sorry. I'm sorry. Yo, Jeffy! Whoa. Excuse me. Are you all right? It was only... We're very pleased you've made this decision. We, uh, worked with him, what? Two years ago? And then again... Hi. Can I have, um... uh, balance sheets for the Tilberg account? Let's take a look at the 60-day figures, all right? Of course. Hey, I understand that you're a Lakers fan. I love basketball. Well, I have season tickets, and I'm not gonna be able to use 'em next week, and I'd like to maybe send a couple tickets over. You know, I have a great story. I took my girlfriend about a month ago. I was sure she was gonna hate it. Ends up she turns out to be a great fan. I mean, she loved it. She just thought it was great. Screaming and carrying on. I mean, it was just hilarious. Gentlemen, will you excuse me for one moment, please? - No problem. - Certainly. Be right back. Oh, listen, while we have the time, why don't we take a look at page 13 again? 13. What have you done? What do you mean? Oh, you know damn well what I mean. There are batting averages in my section report. Batting averages? Seems st... Are you still in, uh, batting champions? I'm in a meeting, you swine, with Howard and two pension fund administrators. Where's my section report? Where's my Schedule-47? Patterson, is everything all right? Yes, Howard. Fine. One minute. Michael, what's this I hear about the Schedule-47? I don't know. I mean, it's all set, ready to roll. Good. - So are we, so let's go. - Yes. I'm not admitting I did anything, of course. Of course not. But if you give me mine back, I'll see if I can get you yours back. What do you want? I want you to go down to your office... I'm in a meeting. Go down to your office and get my report back online in 60 seconds. Ruth, I'm gonna be here for another two-and-a-half hours. Yeah, no, no. I'm fine, I'm fine. I'm just tired, you know? I wanna go to bed. Yep. All right, well, um, say I'm sorry to your parents. Okay? And I'll call ya in the morning. I love you, too.

Looks like a cop to me. Tony? Old joke. - Let's get outta here. - Yeah. All right. - Later! - Yeah. - I won't wait up. - You're staying here? Oh, upstairs. For a while. Hey, got your car? Can I drive? So it worked? Oh, yeah, like a dream. I mean, I wish you could have seen Patterson's face. - Oh, you watched. - Yeah, yeah. No, the whole time. Oh, that's great. Always got to stick around and watch the fun. Watch 'em squirm. Hey. How about some champagne? ...would like to buy item 1 and item 7 and item 28. - Right? - Yes. - This one, and this one? - Yes. Jesus. Excuse me. Oh, really? - You okay, darling? - Darling. I'd like to introduce you to my husband, Dr. Stiegel. - And this is Maxwell, uh... - Cunningham. Nice to meet you, Doctor. - My friends call me Don. - Don. Well. Good to see you. Didn't you know? She's dead. Dead? Chantal? Mm-hm. Hans killed her. Well, actually, Chantal asked him to do it. She would have done it herself anyway. I'm shocked. After looking at these pictures all night, I can't even think about anything like that. Dominic! Dominic! I'm Franco. - Franco. - Good to see you. Claire. I think you met last night. - Hi, how are you? - Oh, you remember. Of course. I'm very sorry. Oh, well, thank you. No, I... Don't worry about it. So what do you think of the art? - Not... - Oh, so derivative. - And without hope. - Without hope. Definitely without the hope. I think it's great how you manage to keep your spirits up. Must be very difficult for you. I'm sorry. Yes, it, uh... it has... It has been. Well, I think we've seen all there is to see here. I know I have. Hang on, I'm going to, um, free myself from an entanglement. I'll be right back. What's going on here, Alex? She thinks your wife just died. What? If you're gonna fuck a fantasy anyway, might as well be a good one. - Let's go. - Yes, let's go. Bueno. I mean, I hardly even knew the man, but Andre said he was fine, so I stayed. Oh, the place was beautiful, too. You would have loved it. It overlooks the ocean. It's so nice, Dominic. Yes. It is. Does anybody want an espresso? No. His wife was insane. - He had a wife? - Yeah. Do you have any liquor? - Yeah. Whatever you'd like. - Rum. All right. Yeah, no, they were separated. He had changed the locks and everything, but it turns out she owned the place. Very nice. Tried to kill me. She showed up in the middle of the night with a big knife, so I split. - Do you play? - No, never. So, show me around, Dominic. All right. Uh, let's... Yeah, let's go upstairs first. Do you want me to get you anything? - Are you sure? - No, no, no. I get a beer. All right. So how, uh... how... How long ago was this? Oh, five years. But I stayed on the island for two more seasons. Where do you live now? Is that a sundeck? Who are you? Friend of Michael's. Who are you? I'm fine. Is Michael here? He's busy. Tell him it's his brother. Tell him I have the fear. I said he's busy. Oh. Okay. Who are you? What are you doing here? Helping Michael. Can I ask you something? I don't have it. Have what? Your accent. Must be looking for it by now. He told you? I knew. But didn't wanna say anything. Some people just can't lie. He's still very upset about Jasmine's death. Listen. What? It's Dominic. Yeah. I think I'd be good for him. Sure. You make a very funny face when you come. Jesus Christ. No, no, no. It was just gettin' good. Relax, Dominic. I thought you looked really good. I thought you looked beautiful. Especially when you were on top. Thanks. My cab. Bye. Just wait right here. Claire! Let me give you a ride. That's okay. Just wait a second. Let me at least give you cab fare. I have money. Well, can I get your phone number? Why? Well, I just, uh, I mean, we... Dominic, we just felt like it, so we did it. Relax. I just thought I might call you. That's all. You're so sweet. Get home safely. Can't believe you did that. Aw, come on, man. I gave her to you. Gave her to me? What the hell are you talking about? At least you could say "thank you". I reminded her of your grief towards Jasmine. Michael, I don't mind you giving away my Franco thing. Smart to keep the dead wife, though. Confess to one lie, but continue another. Nothing like it to confuse people. You know, I think she would have gone for you without me. She said we seem like brothers. She did? Yeah. Well, I know you must have done something, because that never happens to me. Does now. Tell me what you want, Mick. Mick? Tell me what you want, tell me what you're afraid of. - I, uh... - Just for fun. Come on. Tell me. What are you afraid of? I'm afraid of getting married, I guess. And that's easy. Don't. Well, I'm engaged. Why? Uh, I did... I didn't wanna lose her. I... I'm terrified of getting married. Done. Now tell me what you want. More than anything else in the world, what do you want? This guy Patterson and I are both up for the same job, senior analyst. I want that job. I want it so bad. Then, drink to it. Make it happen. Make it happen. You can give me that quote on the whole 70 million? Michael, I've already told you I could. Twice, in fact. You wanna dump the dollars or not? Hey, Michael, you wanna go to lunch? I can't. You know, I... I gotta meet somebody. Great job on the bi-monthly. When have you had time to sleep? Pete, I gotta call you back. If you wanna beat the morning trade figure, I've gotta get 901719- I know, I know, I know. I'll call you back. Hi, Alex. Sorry I'm late. Listen, just, uh, I don't know, leave... leave 'em under the seats, is fine. Sure you can't go? Beautiful day. The track? No, I really can't play the ponies right now. - I'll... You're uptight. It's work. You wanna tell me about it? It's a matter of precise timing. I've been on the phone with the guy all day. The trade figure comes out at 5:30 tomorrow morning, and it's going to be significantly up, I know. - How do you know? - I just know. I feel it. It's my job to know. I should dump dollars before New York closes today, but my company policy dictates that I can't make a move until after the trade figure is out. So what happens if you do it before? Well, if I'm right, you know, I'm ahead of everybody, the client cleans up... So you can make him money, and it's not illegal. What's the problem? It's more complicated than that. It's a question of judicious business. It's not a question of judicious business. It's a question of balls. Now, do you have the cojones or don't you? I was up all night going over that report. - Thanks, Jeff. - I'm tired. Good morning, Michael. Got three lines going already. You wanna pick up one? Yes, just a moment, please. He'll call back. Come on. Yeah! Michael, are you in there already? Yep. Right here. There's a Mr. Cojones for you on line 3. - Hello. - Good morning. What the hell are you doing up already? I haven't gone to bed yet. Well, how'd you do? I was right. Up by almost a 30 percent pop. Great. Let's celebrate. No, no. I can't. I gotta go to Ruth's parents' house for dinner. Anniversary party, very formal. Sounds like a riot. Yeah, well, I can't get out of it. Dr. Fielding would be crushed. Suit yourself. Hey. Nice work, Mick. Thank you. Michael, don't forget about the DMV to get your new driver's license- - Right. - A nine o'clock. And also you've got just a stack of messages - from yesterday. - Rig ht. So I'm just gonna get a cup of coffee. I'll just be at my desk. All right? - Leslie? - Yes, sir? Call me Mick. Mick. Patterson here. You're kidding. When did those figures come in? Howard? Hold on for a second. Good news. Thank you, sir. Thanks, Daddy. Terrific. - Isn't she lovely? - She gets it from her mother. Charming. Congratulations. Happy anniversary. - Look at you. - Oh, yeah. - Thirty years, huh? - I like it. - You do? - Yeah. A little greasy, but nice. I'm late. I'm sorry. It's just... Is everything okay at the office? Oh, it couldn't be better. Your friend is here. My friend? - Michael, there you are, dear. - Happy anniversary. - This is for you. - Oh. I've been chatting with Francois. Francois? Bonsoir, Michel. - Francois, you made it. - Oui. I was doubting it, but I could not let you celebrate without me. Of course not. No. - How are you, Michael? - Dr. Fielding. Congratulations. Thank you. Thirty years. Guess I'll be coming to these things for you pretty soon. Yeah, I guess so. You didn't tell me you're working with someone from the Paris office. Yes, yes. We've been, uh... I have been here for several weeks. Yeah. We were just about to look at the promotional campaign that you and Francois put together - for the new French office. - Oh, good. Pardon, but Mick and I, we have seen this promotion a thousand times. Mick. - He's charming. - Yes, he is, isn't he? Francois? What the hell are you doing here? - Don't be mad. - I'm not mad. I'm just very surprised. Yeah, but you might be in a minute. What did you do? Just want you to know that I did this for you. Did what for me? Ch, my“ - You didn't... - Just the highlights. It's for the best, really. Mazda! Oh, my God. - Come here. - Dr. Fielding... Turn it off! I can explain. That French guy that was here, Francois... Come here, you little shit. - Hey! - Hey! Hey! Hey, come back here! Hey! You asked me to, remember? Here you go. Gay White Male. Not you. Oh. Excuse me, what's going in there? Hello. Dominic! Dominic! Dominic! Oh. You look beautiful. That's not my name. Dominic. That's not my real name. My name is K... Kirk. - Kirk? - Yeah, my real name is Kirk. And I suppose your wife isn't dead either. No, she's not even my wife. You should be angry. Angry is boring. I don't feel like it. What do you feel like? Oh, geez. Watch out. Wow. - Who are these people? - Just people. Oh, hey- Decongestant? Oh. Great. Forgive me? The hell with it. I owe you. I'll keep this. All right. What are you doing? What's... what's this? - It's my number. - Oh. - Do you want it? - Yeah, of course. Yeah. - It's good for a couple of clays. - Are you ready? Yeah, let's get out of here. Mm. I'm sorry. - Cheers. - So long. Yep. You tired? Not a chance. Good. Hi, there. Dr. Fielding? Perfect. I've got a mask for you! Oh, no, no. I don't need one. Uh, 8.50. Come here. Come on! Come on. Put your hands here. Dominic, come here. - Shut up. - Come on. Empty the register. - Please don't, don't shoot. - What? Empty it! Press "No Sale", upper left. Take it! Please. - Please, don't. - Go start the car. Please don't kill me. Please. Please don't shoot. Look at me. Please, don't shoot me. Oh, God. - Open your mouth. - Oh, God. Oh, God. Bang. You were great. Great! Pull over. What? I think you'd better stop the car. You Okay? Mick?

Move back to Seattle. Alex? What happened last night? What do you mean? The last thing I remember is we were driving around Patterson's neighborhood, and I go into the office today and find out that he got beat up. And I'm standing there in the middle of everybody with dried blood all over my hand. Did we go to Patterson's last night? Yes. We went to Patterson's. Well, I mean, I didn't hit him, did I? You didn't just hit him. You beat the shit out of him. What the hell were you doing? Holding him down. Don't worry. I mean, I'm not gonna tell anybody. Tell anybody? Jesus Christ, this guy is a colleague of mine. Oh, don't worry about him. He won't say anything. He knows you'd kill him if he did. Wait... wait a sec. Kill him? Yes. And if you didn't kill him, I would. I told him that this morning... when I went to get the donuts. Get out. Get out! Okay. You got what you wanted. Thanks, Fred. Mick. Howard wants to see you in his office right away. - Did he say what it was about? - No, he just said "right away". - Okay, talk to you later. - I heard you. Sorry. Sit down, sit down, sit down. I just got off the phone with Patterson. Ch? Says he's withdrawing himself from consideration for senior analyst. Yes? Says he doesn't want the pressure. Personally, I think he's overreacting to what happened to him last night. Yeah, I... I heard about that. Well, if Patterson's out, that makes you far and away the leading contender. I just wanted to let you know. Thank you. That's good to hear. You don't seem very pleased by this. No, no. No, no, no. I'm, uh, no, I'm very pleased about it. Yeah. I'm sorry that it happened this way. Well, don't let it obscure the fact that, uh, you've worked very hard for this, and that you certainly deserve it. Oh, hi, Mike. Love to see it when you're finished. Finished? When you're finished with your redecorating. - Is Alex upstairs? - Who? Uh, Tony. Whoever. The guy who was staying upstairs. Oh, he re-upped. What? He re-enlisted in the Navy. He and my brother were ship mates. That son of a bitch! Hey, watch your fuckin' mouth, man. That Tony, he's a hell of a guy. Do you know why I took your stuff? To show you that I could. Put things back in perspective for you. What kind of a game are you playing with my life? This is my life. I'm going to the police. What are you gonna tell 'em? That some guy you knocked over a hamburger joint with stole all your stuff? I just want it back. It's mine. Like your promotion is. Like Claire is. Do you think you woulda gotten any of it if it weren't for me? Keep it. Keep the stuff. - So the stuff makes us even. - Yeah. The stuff makes us even. Hi. So what do you mean you want to stay here? Well, would you rather I not, 'cause I'm... Oh, no, no, no. That's fine. I'm just wondering what's wrong with your place. Nothing. Oh. Come on. Morning. Do you have any messages for me?

Thank you. - Uh, take a look at this, Carol. - Okay. Hello. Michael Boll. Hey, sweetheart. Don't pretend you don't remember me. What do you want? I'm doing you a favor. I don't want a favor. I did what you said. Your stuff's gone. I sold it. Uh, but there's a lot of shit that's no good to anybody. Computer discs, pictures, passport. Do you want it? Yes, I think that would be a good idea. Great. You know the oil fields off La Cienega? Your stuff's in a box by well number 43. That's not exactly convenient. Well, take it or leave it, pal. It's on my way out of town. You won't see me anymore. Oh, your wallet's there, too. My wallet? Yeah, you left it on the bar at the beach, remember? I think your Diners Club card's over the limit, though. Adios, Mick. I've gotta go someplace. I'm sorry. Can we pick this up in the morning? - Sure. - Great. - Is everything okay? - Yep. Leslie, can you help Carol with all the...? - Where shall I say you went? - Don't. Yeah. Sorry I asked. Hi, pal. I want you to remember one thing. You asked for this. Don't touch that dial. - Well, hello. - Hello. - Is he here? - Yeah. Where's all his stuff? Is he moving? Uh, well... Yeah. Sort of. Where is he? - Oh, uh, he's in the bedroom. - Good. I wanna talk to him. Great. Come on down. So where is he? Stop the fooling around. Mind if I play through? Where is he? Hail Mary, full of grace. Our Lord is with Thee. Blessed art Thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of Thy womb, Jesus. Whoa. You thought we were even before. Now we're even. Before you do anything stupid, like go to the police, I'd think it through, pal. 'Cause I've covered all the bases. Elvis has left the building! Michael, it's me. Open the door. Michael. What's going on? I thought you didn't wanna come here. Go away. Michael. Michael. Come on. Michael. Could you please stop that? It's just a matter of time. Get in bed with the devil, sooner or later you have to fuck. Did it in my apartment with my golf club. Run out of my office after getting some call from some woman. He's got my jacket. My jacket. I call the police, my jacket shows up in... Oh, no, no. I can't be in this. Blood all over my car or in some dumpster. Or my office. No, the cops won't believe this guy even exists. Don't even think about going to them. Promise me you won't. Oh, I need a smoke. I need your help. We have to take your car. Mine's too small. If anything happens, the cops find out, I can't promise what I'll do. I don't wanna let you down. What if somebody gets on? Let's put it down here. Okay. Go get the car and bring it around. The keys. - I left them upstairs. - Jesus. I was distracted, okay? - Just hurry. - Uh-huh. Hurry. I told you, I did not fuck her! You took it out. To me, that's fucking. Okay. I fucked her once. - Did you like it? - God damn it, shut up! I'm sick of it! Every week! - How was it? - What? Was she good? I don't wanna hear it. Wait. Just forget it, okay? Wait. Where do you think you're going? That's it! That's the end of it! Come back here. Not until you start trusting me. Trust you? You just admitted that you fucked her. Yeah, but you wouldn't even know that if I hadn't told you. Get lost! You and your stupid dog! Pisbo. Over here. Yeah? What's this? It's from Personnel. It's my transfer. - Your what? - My transfer. I'm moving down to Financial Services. - Why? - Why don't you tell me, Mick? I mean, something is obviously wrong. Something has been wrong. You haven't even spoken to me in clays. And I can't handle it. I'm sorry. Leslie, wait, let's talk about this. What? What? What? What? Noth... noth... it's nothing. All right. See you later... Mick. Tell you exactly what it means. It means he followed us. Yeah. He knows where we put the body. He followed us the whole time? Right. That means he's seen me. He knows where I live. Oh, Michael, I can't be in this. Well, what are we gonna do? Michael? I gotta call you right back. It's what he does, watches me squirm. If I'm not squirming enough, he gives me another jab. I tell, I'll go back to jail. I'll die there, I swear to God. Tm gonna fuckin' hang. And there's not a goddamn thing I can do about it. Unless I kill the son of a bitch. Of course, I can't kill the son of a bitch, unless I know where he is. Now you're thinking like him. Do you have a copy of The Reader? Do you? Where? Uh, yeah, um... Here... I know how to find this son of a bitch. No, Michael. I mean, the police have a file on me, they've gotta have a file on this guy. We just have to get his fingerprints. You'll have to wait here. You know that. Yes. I mean, if he sees you, everything's fucked. Yeah, I know. So you'll wait here while I try to get his prints. Yeah. Fun Loving Couple Seeks... Petite...

I just don't feel safe about it. I would never ask except I'm stuck, and I don't, you know, I don't have anybody else that I can go to. If it was anybody else but you... Thank you. - Be careful, okay? - Absolutely. Michael? Help! Help! Michael! Help! Help! Michael! Help! - Hold on! - Help! Pismo? What happened? He's here. He tried to kill me. Wait. Pismo? I can't find him anywhere. What happened out there? Hey, I got the address of his friend. Manhattan Beach. That's where I met him. That's where he's staying. Hey, wait. Michael. Would you wait up a minute? Michael. I do not want you coming with me. What is this? Jesus Christ. Where the hell did you get that? Go upstairs and go to bed. What are you gonna do? Michael, wait! Would you just stop for a second? Go back inside. Give me the gun. Don't fuck with me, Pismo. You don't know me anymore. Yes, I do. Give it to me before you hurt somebody. Go on. Take it. Stop! Do not step on the brake. Go touch the pedal. - Let me help you. - You can't help. Michael, please. If you do this, he really has won. Me. I'm next. I'm gonna get us something to drink. Okay. Be right back. You make a very funny face when you come. Anyone ever tell you that? Are you going someplace? What's that? Oh, my jacket. Where were you gonna plant it? In the dumpster at my office, maybe? Your apartment. - Oh. - Under the dumpster, actually. Drop it. You and I need to talk. No. No. No talking. You're gonna die with your mouth shut. Then, do it. You can't, 'cause I never showed you how. Now I'm gonna show ya. Oh! Guess I got ya now, Mick. Fuck you. Get back. I said, "Get back"! Drop the knife in the water. What is this? If you were gonna kill me, you would have back at the house. I said, drop the knife in the water. You're not gonna use that. I'm sorry. What? I'm sorry. Sorry? You... Fuck you! You sorry? You sorry about what? Killing Claire? Trying to kill my brother? Or maybe you're just sorry for holding a guy down while I beat him. Fuck you, you're sorry! You didn't beat anyone. I beat Patterson! You were passed out in the car the whole time! Knocked your hand on the pavement to fuck with you. Fuck with me? I didn't make you do anything that wasn't in you already. People are such hypocrites. They walk through their whole lives playing innocent to the day they die, but they're not innocent. I showed you that. It's why I killed Claire, Mick. My name is Michael. Did you get that? Every word. Oh! Watch out! I called them. They'll be here any minute. Anything? That was fast. You can stay here. What are you going to tell them? I'm gonna tell them what happened.
