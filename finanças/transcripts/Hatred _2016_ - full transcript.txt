„Poles in the East were murdered twice; first by the stroke of an axe, and for the second time by silence. This second death is worse than the first one.” Jan Zaleski HATRED Mother, open up the room offer welcome to the groom. The fiancé of yesterday turns to a newlywed today. Open up - or else, we'll set the house ablaze! What brings you here? What brings you here? We didn't ask you to appear. May 1939 Are you on bread so tight You don't greet the groom right? Please welcome the dear of the bride And let us all come inside. Oh Helen, you dear lass Oh Helen, you dear lass Open the door for us. Bring out the flower ring on the tray, Bring out the flower ring on the tray, Let him pay for it well. And our shoes, were bought in Lvov were boughtin Lvov to be presented under this roof. Bow down Helen. Bow down Helen. Bow down young bride. Apologize to the fatherand mother, Apologize to the fatherand mother, You'll have smooth life like no other. Father, mother, I ask for thy blessing. Beware of false prophets, who come dressed in sheep's clothing, but inside hide the rapacious wolves. Instead of Kingdom of God they preach the Ukrainian Kingdom. To what end?! Acts of sabotage and even murder of Poles keep multiplying. The old brotherly love between Poles and Ruthenians slowly disappears. - So now he is a Pole? - What Pole? He is orthodox! l turn the refore to the orthodox, so numerously gathered here: let's love each other in the same faith! God willing today's wedding of Helena Głowacka and Vasil Huk shall be an occasion for the renewal of the old mutual friendly relations. Potatoes already at the parsonage and the flour, as agreed, after harvest. We await father at the table. You are to win. Ready? Hell of a ride Petro! I can't. State monopoly. You can drink all you want in the inn. As of when money stinks to lsaak? lsaak has no license. Poles have. Poles conduct searches and arrests. They ride villages and confiscate pamphlets, guns, everything. And what happened with Ukrainian schools? Closed down. Ok, lsaak sells Baczewski, but for 2.50 a liter. How much?! You are marrying a Polish girl and you can't afford a good vodka? You wouldn't give such a price to a Pole. l would. Even higher. But to you I'll offer discount 5 cents per bottle. Ten. Deal. Vasil, this is Bohdan. He arrived from Lvov, but he is one of ours. Blessed be Christ. And God forever. He wanted to enter the university, but didn't want to sign a loyalty declaration, so he wasn't admitted. Let's invite him to the wedding at least. To the Ukrainian nation and the state. Ask what's more important for them, your independent Ukraine or acers of land? That's exactly the issue. Why does a Polish settler get acers and Ukrainian nation lives in poverty? How many Poles and how many Ukrainins live in this land? I don't want any trouble, Ivan. Let's smoke. There won't be any trouble, brother. Let's live! Standing in the meadow is red viburnum tree. Why are you young girl, so afraid of me? -Are you happy? -Yes. And you? What about me? Have you both kissed already? They're coming! C'mon! Kwiatkowski, stand up! Colonist from Warsaw, got the land as perregulations. Father wanted to buyit, as it boarded our fields, but the village head is a Pole, so there was no chance. Look here! Communism is better, cause everyone gets the same. lt's fair. And they ordered us to speak Polish and practice Catholicism. They tore down orthodox churches, so that all people become Polish - Catholic. Pole a fine lad, Ukrainian a cad. ln Galicia Polish gendarmes were hanging Ukrainian girls head-down. What for? So that their dresses fall down. Dresses were colorful, so they called it tulips. Be greeted oh holy korovai. Be greeted oh delicious korovai. Maciej, do as you're told, Pay for the korovai in gold. And for God's sake Offer us a piece of cake. Money won't bring you happiness, but it's good to have them. Wilusz, do as you're told Pay for the korovai in gold. -The wolf bit him! -A dog. This is how you greet the priest? Where's vodka? When they tasted human blood, they will start attacking people. Vodka! For the other leg. My periwinkle flower ring My periwinkle flower ring l used to treat you like a king. l used to hang you on mybed. l used to hang you on mybed. Today they took you off my head.

Depends. -Sometimes guys need to be... - Killed? Pieracki, ever heard that name? You should read some books. Then you'll tell it to the boys. Let's toast Hitler. He will help us form the independent sovereign Ukraine. You'll see. She's too young for Maciej. What will people say? Probably less than they say today. That Hela Głowacka is marrying a khokhol. Maciej has something against the Orthodox? No. Better marry an Ukrainian than a Jew. Okay. There's an age gap between us. But I'll sign over the land and love will come later. lt's less than a year since your Teresa passed away. l need a new wife. Because l can't handle such a big farm alone. A deal? Fourteen acres. Eleven. But better land, by the forest. Two pigs and a cow. A horse. But we have to rush with the wedding, The harvest gets near and people talk about the war. Swear. That you'll always love me. l swear. To God. Mom, I have to tell you something. We too have something to tell you. You're going to marry Maciej. Allegedly Poles closed down Orthodox churches... and liquidated them. And I was told by the priest from Chelm that they all were unused. Unused? So many churches in one district? Father, l have a matter to discuss. Sad is the evening and the morning grey. My darling has gone away He's gone away and not coming back. Come, they are leaving. What will the people say? l'd rather die. Father won't change his mind. - l will never - Come. Wander off Helen, wander off. Wander off Helen, wander off. Why are you crying, silly? Don't blub. We'll visit you in Fall. Put the keys on the table, Go and find some peace. Go and find some peace. You've ruled enough with those keys. Be greeted my thresholds. Be greeted my thresholds. Petro! September 1939 Poland is no more. Budki Osowskie, Osy and than Kustycze. Is your farm large? No. My father is a teacher. Soviets attacked from the otherside. Poland is no more. If you look for death, die for the Ukraine! A few more Ukrainians have escaped, Lieutenant. Burry the dead, disperse and return safely home. This is my last order. Do you have anything to eat, mother? We've got money. Where did you get those clothes? I've borrowed justin case. What? She gave us food. And you stole from her. And what? Young. Much younger then you, Corporal. Why would I need an old one? I was drafted right after the wedding. So you didn't have a chance to dip, sir. You snot. I did. And I'll get back to them, as I have children from my first marriage. Godspeed. Good, isn't it? What are you? Get the clothes off! Give me that uniform, you Polish shit! No! Blessed be Jesus! For ever and ever. From the front? Deserter. That means ours? Yeah. And why did you bypass the village? I went to take a shit. Get in. We don't go far. But we'll give you a lift. l know it from those who know what they are talking about. Lower! Bring it lower! The German aims further then Poland. Where are you from? Volhynia. Father sold the farm and got a job at the railway. Ukrainian and worked at the railway? In 1924. Maybe, as it was long time ago. Later we were only good to clean the muck. Is anything left forus? We haven't been upstairs. Are you going to help, or just sit here? Move it! Father will guard the cart, and we'll go to the ceremony. What ceremony? Ukrainian and doesn't know? I lost track of time. Nothing special. Apolitical one. They are proclaiming the Ukraine. It's time to part. I'll be going to my village. As you are Ukrainian, you need to come with us. There is no other route to Volhynia then through the village. When they won't be looking, run. - I'm Ukrainian. - I know you are. God be with you. Brothers and sisters in Christ. Dear Ukrainians. The end has come to our oppressor. We are putting Poland in to the grave. Soon Polish masters will also be laid in the tomb. And we shall attain the independent and free fatherland. Let's offer our thanks to God. - Glory to the Ukraine! - Glory to the heroes! - Glory to the heroes! - Death to the Poles! Ukrainian glory and the freedom, has not yet died! Still upon us brave brothers, Fate shall smile! Oles! Oles, you shithead! Franek, go bring the cows. 1, 2, 3, Oles! When Hawrylukis done with timber, cut the grass and load the chuffcutter. Ok. Franek, cows! Mosiek, be afraid. Hid again in the same place! Don't stare, bitch. Mosiek! I waited for you a long time. And our... Franek! Am I to look after cows myself?! You're not mymother, you can't give me orders. Cross yourself. But you drink milk, don't you? So run to the pasture, quick! Mother says, Soviets have stolen our chicken. Why didn't you fight for it? Don't make them call her mother. Their mother is dead. This is myhouse, not yours. I can do what l want. I am going to feed cows, cause nothing here is done properly! Don't worry about the old woman. She'll get used. Sep... tember. 1939. Do you know that only the oldest male hand in the family can write here? This here is about you being born in 1932. Here, that your mother had died. And here, that l married Zofia. Today I wrote when the Germans attacked Poland. And the Russians... That I have returned from the war. Maybe I should also write about the chicken, huh? Died... Who is Tadzik? Your brother. He froze on the way to be baptized. That's why you were baptized already of water. And me too? No, you were born in summer. Dinner is ready. Go. Baptized of water! Oh Lord bless us and thy gifts we are about to eat. In the name of God, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. We are going to have a baby. Praised be Lord. To the son. How does Maciej know, it's a son? If you keep on staring at Zosia. I'll remodel your face, you won't recognize it in the mirror. Is he back? What do you want? You have a husband. What are you looking for here?! - Is he back? - No! Where have you been?! I visited parents. Brought them eggs. But you come from direction of Zawodzie. People say from Hapyna. I went to her, because... She's a midwife. -To ask, if... we can... -What? You know... I hear the school is open. I can give children a lift. The school? Zosia, are you well? Nothing's changed since yesterday. You saw each other yesterday, right? Yesterday? Yeah. Well kids, newtimes, a newteacher. We'll see what language you'll end up speaking. Change clothes. You are to help with the cabbage at midday. Make me scrambled eggs. On bacon. Jews are not allowed. Alive. Thank God. We won't need it. It's a superstition. The same as your crosses and medallions. Who has them, hand up. Take them off and put them on the desk. And now I'd like to get to know you better. What's your name, boy? Oles. Last name? Hawryluk. And what are you talking about at home? Most often, about what? About field work that needs to be done. Or that I shouldn't play with that Jew. Tell me boy, your father fought in the war? Yes. No. He fought, but in the other one, long before... Letter from the Council. Just in case, moneyand the rest I buried by the apple tree. - What are you doing here? - I brought that one with me. Skiba, Matvei, Casimirovich! Mister Skiba. As of now you are relieved from the post of the village head. New appointee is Stepan Shuma. Shuma, come here! Beware Skiba, because you are a kulak. I'm no more a kulak, then you are a communist. Now anyone owning more than 50 acres of land is a kulak, a rich landowner. And for ones like you, there will be special taxes and compulsory deliveries of milk, meat, grain... and food. And those who won't pay will be imprisoned as counterrevolutionaries. - Their land incorporated into kolhoz. - How can we deliver? There's awar. - We have nothing to eat ourselves. - Quiet! We have no sowing seed. Today we have only one color! Red! Now about oppression of the Polish land lords. Polish landlords and capitalists oppressed the people of Western Ukraine. Bound it in chains of slavery and oppression. Where to? And the child? Child goes with us. I want to know whose baby you are going to deliver. Did he sweepy our chimney or not?! I'm going to bed. NKVD! Open up! - Skiba Matvei Casimirovich? - Yes. What is it? No talking! Where are you?! Shut up you scum! Where is the gun?! Pack up belongings and food! Dress up children! To whom am I talking, filth? You have half an hour! Get up! Load them up! Leave me alone! Move! - Skiba Matvei Casimirovich. - Entire family? - Yes. - Box car 7. Get out! Quick! Move it! It's a payoff for 1920. They remember the beating they got from Piłsudski. Polish bloodsuckers will not oppress our people anymore! Open up. Yet Poles still live here and this isn't good, because this is an uncertain element. They will always remain enemies of the working people of the Ukraine! Skiba, Zofia. Zosia, are you well? Look after my farm. Are you well?! Hostile blood will always manifest itself, even in 3rd generation! Deport them! Shuma, you forgot your mother is nee Borucka?! Shutup, you dumb. Shuma is right! Forward! Impossible. As many got in, must arrive. You'll report one dead. No. Corpses also travel to the destination. Tomorrow you'll find a replacement and the number will match. The rest of the vodka is yours. Out! Step back! Back! Run to Głowacki! Everything's gonna be fine. I promise. Why did you bring her here?! Didn't she make you suffer enough?! Undress her! Put the water on stove! She can't stay here! She escaped from the transport. This is punished with death! There is not enough food for us! When did waters break?! I'm asking: when did waters brake?! - I don't know. - You never knew a thing! I love you. Push! Breathe! Push! There you are, scum! What's the matter, Commander? Where's vodka? I don't understand. What is it you don't understand? Pietya, right? NKVD deals with passport and political matters. Militia with documents and public order. Yet, for this vodka I need to shoot you myself. Petro... Why do you lie here? It's cold here. Get up. June 1941 Where have you been?! Tell this snot that he could skive with his father. Here one has to work f'n... Our house is empty! Do you think dad is alive? I don't know. One should pray and hope for the best. And if he's dead, the farm is yours or mine and Franek's? Franek, come back! May be they are already at the gate? We welcome the victorious German army with great joy and gratitude! We've built a gate, but you were to cone from direction of Zawodzie... Never mind. We are happy that our new Ukrainian... state will cooperate with Great Germany. Long live Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists! Long live Stepan Bandera! Long live führer Adolf Hitler! Let me go! What are you doing?! Are there more Jews in the village? Esther! There was a boy and two girls. Look for the rest. Then burry all together. There! Where are they? For sheltering Jews death penalty. Those potatoes where are they? May be they stuck to Hawryluks' fingers. I won't play with you anymore. You're a Pole. Heta - turn right. Wio - forward. Drive on. Stop father. I forgot my hoe. I'll come back on foot. What's with your children? Mosiekis here since summer. You always was and remained stupid! If Hawryluk won't, then Poles will denounce you! Either they disappear, or I'll inform Germans myself! Don't you dare risking your family's life for the Jews. And mine or mother's too. Zosia! Can I drive? No. I need to take the food quota to the Germans. I almost forgot. Hela wrote a letter. They have a new daughter. Oksana. Nice. Write down: Oksana. You are the oldest man in the family, aren't you? Mamulka is calving! Good morning. You are not going to stab me, are you? Look for the Jews! And what now? I'll pay you! I have golden rubles burried in the forest! You'll be rich! But you have to hide us for the whole winter. My wife is sick! We need... dog's lard. Quiet! You will not falter to perform the most dangerous deed if required by the good of the cause. Repeat. Can't you memorize that? Next one. With hatred and deceit you'll receive the enemies of your nation. Your wife is not moving. Where is the money? How much further?! Run. They wrote on yours too. Any news from Maciej? Is he alive? Maybe. Why do you ask? Just so. I wanted to tell you, that... I too... don'thave a woman... yet. And if only you'd wanted... - What happened? - The river washed out. The priest! Dear God. They are animals, not people. Animals aren't cruel. Two have died when we started. Then the Russians shot another few. And one drowned in the Volga. Only I and another Ukrainian got to Bereznica. From there on people helped. And why it took Maciej so long to get here? The illness stopped me. They paint the walls. “102” on the Ukrainian houses and crosses on Polish ones. We had 4, because there are 4 of us. There were, before you returned. Another chicken disappeared today. Where are you off to? We have no grain. We need a newdog, padlocks and bolts. Ours are worthless, and the house needs to be locked. It's dangerous. People know me here, stupid. They knew father Joseph too. Kerosene is almost finished! That's the way to do it. When will daddy be back? The red crosswise. I'll raise Skiba's children like my own. One meter from the head, or the blood will stain your uniform. Understood? Stop! Don't move! Kwiatkowski has proposed. Why didn't you agree? - For good luck.. - God willing... Antoni. Wilk. His eyes are open. Who are you, mister? He doesn't look Jewish, but you need... It's my house and I'll do what I want. Got you! Here. Not with the tip but flat. What's a railway-man doing here? I came to help. On the farm. You took liking to Skiba's widow? If there is a forced labor commission, I'll assign you. And tell her, she hasto bring Germans grain for the tax, as the deadline nears. And I need to see the receipts for the milk. Name? Zofia Skiba, nee Głowacka. You can take them all. Chmielnicki rose from the steppe and grew into the giant. Calamities poured down on Poland. - Doyou know what honor is? - No. Honor means, that when you say something, then regardless of anything you have to do it. When? Tomorrow. Leave it and go to sleep. Stop! A Pole? You've got lucky, we aren't Ukrainians. Give us some food and moonshine and we'll let you free. How much did you get? - As much as you wanted. - I wanted more! Potatoes, potatoes... And then they took his eyes out. In our village there are only women. First Soviets deported men to Siberia, then Germans to work in Germany. All I know is that Ukrainians in our village said they'll warn us. We get along well. Do you have vodka? In 20 years the Ukrainian Military Organization and later OUN carried out 1000 attacks. Arsons, assaults, killings. They were killing not only Poles, but Ukrainians who wanted to negotiate with Poland too. My shoes are too tight. Go backand await orders I'll report about the Jews. - Thank you. - God speed. God be with you. Egg. Krauts are finished. Defeat at Stalingrad. We need to organize. It's not the Germans that are dangerous, but the bands. I won't leave my family alone. Transport pass. He should go to the station immediately. - All clear? - Yes. Station. Come here. Your paper. Has Romek retuned? Orlyk, you've knocked out my teeth with the flail, remember? Shut the trap! Hryc Horubala. God! Another volunteer, yes?! Hryc, think of your wife. Of your kids... No! Go to sleep. They disarmed an outpost in Wlodzimierec. Fired some shots at Germans. On retreat they entered the village and requested provisions. Then they said that Krauts, can retaliate on the village for feeding Soviet partisans So they should feign a Russian attack. They asked people to lie down. Some obliged, others were forced to, because they've already noticed that those supposed Russians were speaking Ukrainian. And then with axes, knifes, they killed everybody. More than 150 people on a single day. It's quiet here. They nailed a baby with a bayonet to the table. How do you know all this? Have you heard? Ukrainian police has escaped to the woods. Germans are looking for the volunteers to collect taxes. I came to ask, if you want to join. They accept Poles. My late husband's. Where should I burry it? You shall win the Ukrainian state or die fighting for it! You will not allow anyone to smear the glory or honor of your nation! Remember the great days of our struggle for liberation! How strangers knew which houses are Polish? They were either guided by neighbors, or neighbors were murderers. We must defend ourselves. Who? With what? They have weapons. Let's ask Germans for protection. My man can help. Let's buy rifles from Hungarians. Our Ukrainians will warn us. They won't touch us. Then why are sleeping in the hideouts? You can sleep where you want. I sleep at home. Be proud being the heir of the fight for the glory of Volodimir's Trident! Avenge the death of the Great Warriors! Don't discuss the cause with every one you can, but only with those you need to. This is aunt Bronka. I'm Maciej's sister. Will you give us shelter? They attacked us at night, just after St. Joseph's. Surrounded the village. First walked the Banderists followed by the Ukrainians. From Bialka, Jablonna... Kamionka, Wielkie Pole... Neighbors. They murdered us with axes. Burned alive in the barns. My daughters, Ola and Henia... They searched farms and fields for hours. Finished off wounded. We spent whole night in the ditch. And merciful God has saved us. Zawodzie is on fire! If they are burning whole villages, then they'll burn us in this barn Go to sleep. - You'll be back tomorrow. - I won't leave them. It's an order. They need a guide. Why you? They are going to Kustycze. It's my village. You aren't going anywhere. Good morning. Can I ask a question? Where is this secret organization, which wants to fight the Germans, but can't protect people against the mob with axes and pitch forks? This is going to change. Aren't you afraid of Germans to parade with those guns? Germans now hid in the cities. Kustycze are just behind this forest. And to this clearing you turn right by the oaks. They'll kill you. If they want to, this gun won't save me. Soldier's honor is my weapon. I am going with you. Ok, but only you. The rest takes cover in the woods. Try bus, you're in charge! Zajdel, you and Shorty will escort him back home. Yes, sir. I came to tell you that you mustn't fear. Nothing will happen here. It is over. A truce with Poles. Why do you look at me like I was a bandit? It's time to take care of the harvest. All nations are brothers. They all enjoy the right to live and to look after their prosperity. But it is not allowed and brings no benefit to dissociate the profit from decency. The world is infected with unrestrained devotion to one's fatherland, one's nation, and the measure of such devotion is the strength of hatred towards other nations. Captain Zygmunt Krzemieniecki. It's me. I am the emissary. Polish Government in London has agreed with OUN that both sides arrive to the negotiations unarmed. I've read your poems. The one about two fatherlands very good. With whom do I have the honor? With the free Ukraine! Go! Banderists! The Holy Scripture tells us: When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared. The owner's servants came to him and said: ‘Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?’ ‘An enemydid this,’ he replied. Let us not delude ourselves, that there is a single nation free of this poison. And therefore let every member of every nation feel himself at home in his faith. And let being the member of a particular faith be not connected with hurting, evil thoughts or wrong doing. The servants asked him, “Do you want us to go and pull them up?” And he answered: “No, because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned! Then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.” Let in all faiths and if need be in all languages the man spread the Word of God. Brothers and sisters, we need to cleanse the Ukrainian soil! Let the villages that have solid houses July 11, 1943 a good location, receive all Polish refugees. I need to get back to my family. Do you know a trust worthy Ukrainian? After the mass. Organize self-defence! Don't wait til you are slaughtered! We need to fill the rivers and lakes with Polish blood, because the Ukraine has to be pure like a glass of water! You will not falter to fulfill the most dangerous deed if required by the good of the cause! In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Let your harvest be plentiful. With hatred and deceit you'll receive the enemies of your nation. Glory to the Ukraine! Glory to the heroes! Banderists! Come down, or we'll burn you! Come. Light him up. For oppressing our nation! Death! For the land of our fathers! Death! For Volhynia! Death! For Free Ukraine! Death to the Poles! - Any Poles? - Yes... all dead. Take what you need, cause we're going to burn it. Go to your sister. But slowly. Ukrainians are not scared. They don't run. A Pole! You have to go there. Stop! Where are you going? We are Ukrainians. But you are dressed like a Pole. We stole from the Poles. Cross yourself and say prayer. Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be Thy name... I want to eat. The baby wants to eat. We wanted to kill you, and you're Ukrainian. So we wrapped this kid into the bale of strawand threw into the fire. Whom are you gonna visit there? Polishtshukova. How did this Polish woman wail! Ivanko had to quiet her down with the fork. I know her. She has... a daughter. Ason. And the father in half an hour turned white out of fear. I myself took the skin off his head. Do you want them? You have to kill her. Otherwise you'll all be dead! You are my brother. That's why you are still live. Because I'm your brother. All others who refuse to serve Bandera, get the bullet in their head. Hela is a Pole. You can't help her. But you and children will live. Let her be! She's Polish! - She is your blood! - Shutup! You have married a Banderist, then look what they do with our children! Let's move on!
