♪ Dashing through the snow ♪ ♪ In a one-horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ O'er the fields we go, ♪ ♪ we're laughing all the way... ♪ 17 years ago, I started this company out of a studio apartment, with nothing but a tiny savings and an insatiable appetite for shoes. But, one person alone cannot accomplish what we have built together. And it's because of all of you that I was made an offer I could not refuse. That's why you, along with the new owners, are going to take Madd Shoes straight into the stratosphere. So, thank you to all of you, for making my dreams come true. Cheers. Cheers. Okay. Let's do this. So that's that. Oh... I don't have to get up. I can go back to sleep for three hours if I want to. Hmm. Okay, I'm up. Okay. No messages. Hi, Mom. So, how does it feel? How does what feel? Your first day of freedom. Uh, I don't know. Numb. That's not how it's supposed to be. What are you doing right this second? I'm in the park, watching an adorable family play in the snow. Sounds appropriate for this time of year. So this is... free time, huh? It's, uh, unsettling. Life is what happens while you're busy making other plans... Or, putting out your own shoe line. You worked hard, Maddie, and you got what you always wanted. But what do I do now? Maddie, I'm gonna be blunt. Well, of course you are. That's what you do. Come home, honey. Navigate the in-between with your family. Let life dominate your life for once. Okay, I'll come home for Christmas. Thanks, Mom. Listen up, everyone. Maddie is coming home for the holidays, but it's not her usual in and out in one day, um... She's in a bit of a transition and she needs some family time, so we're going to welcome her with some hometown hospitality. Okay? Hey, Peg? How am I supposed to stay away? You know, a 24-hour visit is one thing, but I run the workshop and this is a lot more than just a quick hello. Well, you can't stay away, Carter. That's just the bare bones of it. Yeah, I know. After all these years and she still hates me. Hate is a strong word, but... When you let someone go with nothing but a train ticket and a broken heart, that's not something one can get over very easily. Yeah, I get it. The holidays are the perfect time for forgiveness, though. Well, we'll see how well that goes over. Hmm. Thanks, Trent. You okay, Maddie? Yeah, I just don't know what kind of reception I'll be walking into. Yeah, well, it's not like you've never gone home before. It's usually just for Christmas day. An extended walk down memory lane might have a few unexpected twists and turns. I understand. Thank you. Good. ♪ Jingle Bells, Jingle Bells, ♪ ♪ jingle all the way ♪ ♪ Oh what fun it is to ride ♪ The people of Claremont sure do like their Christmas. Every year seems more elaborate than the last. Oh, in this town, your devotion is judged by the amount of lights on your house. Too few and you're a scrooge, too many and you're just bragging. Must have been fun as a kid. Seems like a really nice place to grow up. Yeah. It was a great place to grow up. ♪ Dashing through the snow ♪ ♪ In a one-horse open- ♪ Oh! Yeah, right? 75, per usual? Maybe 100- Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm not ready for this. You know what, I can wait outside. It's not that cold. Ooh. Oh. Oh. I'll meet you outside and get the truck warmed up. Talk to you later, guys! I'm gonna finish this, I'll meet you out there. Okay. Oh, no... Hello? Maddie? Hi, Carter. What are you doing hiding behind a tree? Oh, I'm... I'm not hiding. I was... uh, looking for my watch. Uh, it's right there on your wrist. I know. Because I put it there. It... fell off, and I had to go get it. And I did. And then I put it back on, and... It's all good. Problem solved. Oh, and you brought your bags over there with you to look for it. All three of them. What's with the interrogation? Hey, I'm not interrogating, there's just a couple holes in your story, that's all. Only if you're looking for them. It's actually pretty cut and dry. You drop something and you go pick it up. Well, it must have flown off your wrist to make it all the way over there by the tree. Okay Carter, I... I don't feel like I have to explain myself to you. Okay, look, you're right, I'm sorry. This is awkward, and... Uncle Carter? You forgot your scarf. Thanks. Why are you talking to a tree? Maddie, remember my niece, Ava? Yes, but you probably don't remember me. You were little the last time I saw you. I'm a huge fan of Madd Shoes. I saved up my allowance for six months to buy those lace-up boots. I love them. Oh. Well, I could get you a pair from the warehouse for free. Oh no, I... I actually don't think I can do that anymore. Uh, well maybe I could get you a discount. That would be great. I am a fashion design junkie. I make my own dresses. Oh. Well, I'd love to see them sometime. Okay, I'll show you. Can I have the keys? No, because it just started snowing, which means the roads are icy, and your mother said "no driving on the ice." My mom's not back till Sunday. She'll never know. Besides, I need to learn how to drive it in inclement weather eventually. Fine, fine. You can start the truck, but do not go anywhere until I get there. Got it. I've been watching Ava while my sister's flying, you know. 20 years in the airlines, hard to find another job that pays the same and keeps you in one place, so... I admire your sister. It's, uh, not easy being a single parent, and Ava seems great. Yeah. So, this, uh, should be interesting. It's fine. We're both adults. I can handle it, you can handle it, and it's just for the holidays. Yeah, you're right. Um... I'll give you as much distance as possible and... Uh, I should... I should, too. Get inside and say hi to my family. Yeah, okay. Ya... you want some help with the bags? No. I'm good, thank you. Okay. Keep an eye on that watch so it doesn't go flying out by any trees. I thought I heard voices out here. Hi, Mom. Maddie, oh honey. Oh. I am so happy to have you home. I mean, really home, for all of Christmas. My family is here. My extended family too. All the most important people in my life, all in the same place. I think this is going to be our best Christmas yet. Hello? Hi, Katie! Aunt Maddie! Hi. Aunt Maddie, look at my shoes. Oh my goodness, are those the ones that I sent you? Yeah. They barely fit her anymore, her feet grow so fast. Well, we are going to have to get you a new pair for Christmas. Billie. Maddie. - Aw. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. And, Hallie. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. It's, it's good to have you home, Maddie. It's nice to be home. And I'm... I'm looking forward to spending time with you. Well, sure. If... if you have time. It turns out, I do have time. Plenty of time. Maybe we could go Christmas shopping, or, or something, like we used to do when you were a kid. Oh. Ah, that sounds great. Yeah, great. All my kids, my son-in-law, and my grand-baby, all under the same roof. Oh, I have so many plans for us. You have that, Mom? What have you got in here? I have a lot of shoes. Ignore the mess. Your sister has to wrap in here, so that Katie won't see all her presents before Christmas morning, and... if there's not enough space, I can empty out some more drawers. Oh, no, no, it's fine, don't go out of your way for me. I know it's not the Four Seasons and you're used to something a little fancier. Mom, I don't care about that. I'm just here to see all of you. Oh my goodness, you really don't throw anything away. Ehh... I'm afraid to look in these boxes, so many skeletons. It's okay, they don't bite. Oh, my baton. Do you remember how bad I was at this? I did a toss, and I sent Coach Hyde to the emergency room during the homecoming game. I remember. Put it down. Safety first. There's no skeletons here, only memories. I just don't see any sense in throwing away the past. Even the mistakes? There are no mistakes, Maddie. Only decisions. Well, that was uncomfortable outside, and don't tell me you didn't feel it. It was bound to happen. He's practically family, and just because you didn't marry him doesn't make it any less so. I didn't marry him because he didn't ask me. And, would you have stayed in Claremont if he had? Well, I guess we'll never know, because he made that decision for both of us when he decided not to come with me. I was going to be the next Jimmy Choo, and he was going to make custom furniture for everyone in Manhattan. Gosh, we had big dreams, and... and then it was just over. I think some people are maybe afraid of their own power. Their talent. They think all they can ever be is small, so they don't even try. That is definitely not my Maddie, though. I am so proud of what you've built. Carter could have built something, too. Like I said, no mistakes, only decisions. Right. Ha, ha, ha! Mine isn't as good as yours. Well, it doesn't have to be perfect, Katie. All snowflakes are unique and beautiful. Just like you. Oh. Hello. Hey. - Good morning. - Hi. You still make those snowflake pancakes? Oh, around Christmas, every single morning. You wanna help tomorrow? My help in the kitchen tends not to be very helpful. Let's just say the New York Fire Department has been to my home, and leave it at that. Okay, let's get going before you are late for camp. Okay. Katie is doing music camp. She wants to learn the piano. You played the piano, didn't you? Flute. Right. Okay, bye Grandma. Bye Grandma, bye Aunt Maddie. Bye, have fun! Bye, honey. Chilly! Do you want a snowflake pancake? I thought you'd never ask. Aha! So. You can still take a piece of wood and turn it into a work of art. Uh, it's, it's nothing. It's, uh, it's a hobby. It wasn't always supposed to be that way, though. Well, life happens. Carter, two new orders just came in. A desk and a chair. All right, what's the turnaround time? Mild rush? Look, I know how busy you are multitasking with the orders and getting the barn set up for the dance, so I'm gonna bring in some extra help. No, no, no, no, no. We can't afford extra help. I got this, I can handle it. There was some water damage in the gym at the high school, and they need a new location for the holiday formal, so, we're letting them use the barn. Ava was on the committee, so Carter volunteered to help. I don't know if volunteer is exactly the word I would use. You know, "assigned," "delegated." "Forced labour," actually. He volunteered. Which we appreciate, and it's just for the week. Then you have your free time back to work on your own stuff. Well, that's nice of you to do for the community. Oh, don't compliment us just yet. With everything going on, I have no idea how we're gonna pull it off. The dance is less than a week away. It's all too much. Maybe after Christmas this year, it's time for me to retire. She says this every three days. We could sell the business. Like Maddie just did. I've always wanted to go to France. I don't want to travel. I love our business. And you can go to France now, I can handle the day to day of the business. It's too much work for one person. Mom, I'll figure it out. You need to make a definitive decision. Stop riding the fence. I can help, as long as I'm here. You know, when I started my own company, I was a one-woman show. I did sales, marketing, accounting. You're all so busy, and I'm not doing anything. Let me help. Okay. Maddie can take over the dance with Carter. - She can? - I can? Well, you organized this event yourself your senior year. Well, that, that's true, but, uh, my more recent experience is a little more corporate based. But this is where you're going to be the most help, and you know you're going to do a way better job than Carter could. Mm, no offence. Yeah, none taken. Well, I did set the bar pretty high for future classes. Man, it was a lot of work. I didn't even get to dance, not one song. Yeah, I remember. After we were crowned king and queen, I tried to get you out on that dance floor. So, Maddie? What do you say? You in? Sure. I'd love to help. Great. Hm. I'm doing this for my family. Yeah, me too. And I'm running point. Uh, you wouldn't have it any other way. Well, I did do this once before, and I was pretty good at it. Several decades ago. It's like riding a bike. You know, I don't know if you remember this about me, but if I put my mind to it, I can do anything. As evidenced by all of your success. Great. Then I suggest you buckle up and follow my lead. Yes Ma'am. Lead the way. Mmhmm. Oh! Yeah, I think I'll skip that part. Well, one thing you haven't lost is grace. Well, according to this email from the principal, the sprinklers went off and ruined, uh, well, everything. Yeah, the decorations, light, the whole deal. What, so we're starting from scratch? We are, with a limited budget to boot. Well, how much have you done? A little. How little? Uh, I, uh, swept the barn. Carter? We have a week. I'm aware of that information. To plan an entire dance. Mm, yeah. Seems that way. What's the theme? Uh... Christmas. That's not a theme, that's a season. Yeah, but it's a good a theme as any. Right? It's easy. A couple wreaths, some lights, boom. Call it a day. This is one of the last pivotal events of their childhood. We have to do this right. Maddie. It's a dance. They want to get dressed up, get their hair done, take a couple spins around the barn with their crush. Carter, what happened to you? Where is your sense of sentimentality? These are the days that they are going to remember forever. We are going to pick out a theme, and, together, execute it flawlessly. Yes Ma'am. ♪ It's Christmas, you know ♪ ♪ It's everywhere you go ♪ ♪ It comes around just once a year. ♪ Alright. Good to see you! Bye. ♪ We're happy as we say ♪ ♪ This is our favourite day ♪ ♪ 'cause Christmas... ♪ Ah, I got, uh, lights. And in the absence of a theme I thought we could start hanging those around the barn. Did you get what you need? I did. Sandwiches. Committee's gotta eat. Hmm. You know, I think this is a... this is a really good thing that you're doing for your family. Now that you're in somewhat of a, uh, break, a vacation. Uh, I'm happy to help. Everyone works at the business, I'm just hanging around. I don't like feeling useless. Well, come on Maddie, you can never be useless. Don't do that. Do what? Be nice to me. I'm sorry, you want me to call you a couple choice names to make up for it? Okay, let's just focus on a theme. Ah... How about Christmas Masquerade? Come on. You think they want to spend all that time getting ready just so they can cover their face with a mask? Aha. Aha, see, I'm right. Look at you, you know I'm right, but you hate to admit it. Let's see. What about, uh, a Winter Wonderland theme? Great idea. I'm sure it was a great idea last year, and the year before that, and probably the year before that. Okay, fine. We're even. What can we come up with that they haven't done before? I don't know. I'm not a party planner, that's not my forte. Running a workshop? That, I can do. Carter, that's it! That's brilliant! Of course it is. I came up with it. Mind telling me what my brilliant idea was? We do the North Pole. We dress the barn up like Santa's workshop. We'll do things like Mrs. Claus's photo booth, reindeer snacks, stuff like that. I could fabricate an exterior outside the barn. Make it look just like Santa's village. I love it. Santa's village. Perfect. I'm not dressing like an elf, though. I wasn't going to ask you to. You're, uh, a little tall to be an elf. Okay. Yup. Count me in. Wow, I really am a genius, huh? Okay, don't let it go to your head. We still have to execute your little plan. I think it's going to be beautiful. We found some amazing decorations. So, you and Carter are working well together. Yeah, we're managing. I mean, I've run a company for 17 years, I've learned to navigate all kinds of personality types. Not one that you have this kind of history with. I never saw two kids more in love than you and Carter. Well, he took care of that, didn't he? I think you two need to talk. Get some closure. What's the point of rehashing a relationship that happened 20 years ago? 'Cause you need to deal with the elephant in the room. No elephants. I'm a dog person. Stop changing the subject. There's so much between you two that remains unspoken. And you know what happens when you leave things bottled up inside. Yes, they explode. Mmhmm. So, cut it off before you get to the breaking point. Hey! Hi. All right. Goodnight Mom, Maddie. Uh, I thought that Billy was working late and you two were staying for dinner. Uh, he finished his shift early, so we're gonna go have dinner with him. Huh? Don't forget the Christmas cookie swap on Wednesday night. Well, it's my most favourite night of the year. How could I forget? I'm gonna do lots of baking after this little one is asleep. We'll miss you at dinner. Yeah. Another time. High five! Goodnight, Katie girl. Bye. Goodnight, ladies. Okay. Speaking of bottled up, she barely talks to me. Why does she hate me? Maddie, she doesn't hate you. She misses you. She was just so young when you left, she would get so excited every time you came home. But, I... Wasn't present. I let my job take over everything, and now I'm a stranger to my sister. Hallie does want to connect. She just... She doesn't know how. I'll try harder with her. I think that would be nice. Hey, Carter. You're here early. You know what they say. "The early bird works on his own stuff on his own time, "so the boss doesn't get angry." Oh, yeah. I think I saw that on a motivational poster somewhere. What are you making? Oh, it's, uh, it's nothing. Didn't look like nothing. Your work is never nothing. You don't need to go there, Maddie. Go where? To the pity zone. I saw the look on your face. What are you talking about? I don't pity you. I've always thought you were incredibly talented. That you could do so much. Well, not everybody needs validation from their careers. Carter, that is not what I said. Come on, we should get started. ♪ Deck the halls with boughs of holly... ♪ Your decorating committee has arrived. Put me to work. But, not too much work. I'm super lazy. Just kidding. Huge work ethic. Maddie. Natalie. So good to see you. I have to tell you, Ava is great. I would have to agree with you there. Thank you, and thanks for taking this on. I have flights this week, but I will pop in and help as much as I can. And, I brought my sketches. I'll show you later, but... I'm making my own dress for the dance and I want your advice. Ava! Maddie's a professional. You shouldn't bother her with that. Oh, it's okay. I mentor a lot of young designers. I'm fine with it. Thanks, Maddie. I appreciate it. I just don't want her heart broken if she's not good enough. She has this fantasy of going to the Fashion Institute in New York. I understand. And I will be honest with her about her sketches, but gentle. So? Are they any good? Good? Ava, they're stunning. You think so? Yes. I've seen a lot of sketches from up and coming designers, and these are as good as it gets. Your mom said you want to go to the Fashion Institute? Yeah, but, I didn't apply. I mean, like she says, they only take 40 people a year. I think you could be one of them. Really? Not that it matters. It's too late to apply now, anyway. Well, I know the Dean. I could make a phone call. Find out about the application timeline for you. Would you really do that for me? Of course. Everyone deserves to follow their dreams. And, I would go with that one. I knew it! That's the one I'm making. Hey, Ava? We should get you back to the house. Okay. Thanks, Maddie. You're welcome. G'night. Goodnight, Ava. Goodnight, Carter. 'Night. And the elephant is growing. Thank you. Oh, and can I get a slice of Marva's famous pie? Thank you. Oh yum. You know it's 9:30 in the morning? What? Crust is basically bread, and pie is made from milk and eggs, and a few other ingredients I can't think of right now. But I think we can agree that this is a legitimate breakfast food. You're welcome to sit with me, if you want. I don't know if we were, uh, speaking or not speaking. Yeah, I didn't know either, but this conversation would suggest we are. Okay. I, um, I didn't mean to insult you yesterday. I guess there's a lot of unresolved stuff between us, huh? Well, let's clear the air, Carter, once and for all. Right here, right now, so we can co-exist in a more harmonious nature. Okay. Yeah, um. Lay it on me. Okay. You were so vague about the reason you didn't go with me to New York, and then complete radio silence. Yeah, I'm going to be honest with you, I just chickened out. As it became real, the idea of suddenly moving to New York got so big. But that's what was so exciting. Yeah, it was exciting for you. I get that, but... You had a plan. You knew what you were gonna do. You knew how you were gonna get there. But for me, I don't know, I didn't know how I was gonna go from being a guy that just made nice furniture to actually making a living at it. I don't know, maybe it's just something as simple as I didn't see myself moving there and you didn't see yourself staying here. How would you know? You never asked. No, no, no. I am not gonna be the one to stand in your way. From the very first moment I met you, I knew that you were destined for greater things than this place could offer. I thought the same thing about you, Carter, and your talent. No. Claremont was always too small for you. I love this town. I could stay here and do what I love working for your dad. Okay. But when is the last time you sold one of your own pieces? I dabble a little bit. You know? Now there's no pressure. I get that. All I meant yesterday was... you could be great, too. Excuse me. Could I get one of those also? Make mine a double. It's good you got your own, 'cause I'm not sharing. Some things never change. ♪ Ring, ring, ring, there goes the bell... ♪ Thanks for coming with me. I really didn't know what to get Kate or Mom. Hallie, this year is going to be different.

I... I... I know that mom is a little burnt out, and that she would like to travel, and... You taking on the dance is plenty. I... I got the business covered. Hallie... Look, I know that this company was supposed to be yours, and that I got it by default after Dad retired, but I'm good at this, Maddie, and I will find a way to take the business to the next level so that we can hire more staff and Mom can retire in style. I'm sure you will. But I could brainstorm with you. With my brand- I got this, Maddie. Okay? Hey girls. Hey, honey. Hi. That's a wrap on Christmas shopping. Oh, what'd you get me?

Oh, I probably won't get in, so there's not much to tell yet. Oh, Ava, you have to have faith in yourself. And when it comes to fashion, trust me. You have the "it factor." Thanks, Maddie.

Hey, Peg. I got, uh, Hallie on the phone. She says yours keeps going straight to voicemail? Oh, I think I left it upstairs. Carter, I am so sorry we're keeping you late tonight. Ah, don't worry about it. I had to stay here and finish those rush orders. So it's all good. Hi, honey. Mmhmm. Wow. Uh, cutting down trees? Baking? Do you even recognize yourself?

Well, that remains to be seen. I love Christmas lights. The way they blink in a pattern. Hmm. You know, when I was a kid, I used to try to guess which coloured light would blink next. Blue! Oh, see, it's not as easy as it looks. Oh, it is so difficult. Gosh, I haven't done this in years. I mean, it's always been there, but I guess I just stopped looking. Yeah, well, we all get bogged down with life's day-to-day stuff. I think it's important that I had this time with my family. Might be the very foundation I've been missing. Mmm. Yeah, community's important. I mean, your family, and mine, this town. They've all had my back. And you didn't think you'd have that in New York? Well, I knew that you would be there for me, and... I don't know. What about you? What about your community in New York? Oh, well, I have a really nice group of friends. I mean, most of my social life does revolve around work. You know. Proximity matters to a workaholic. Of course. What about, um, boyfriends? Oh, uh, a few. One for almost four years. Wow. But, he wasn't the one. And you? Yeah, I've, uh, dated here and there. A few girlfriends. Same as you. But you never got married. No. No, I came close once. What happened? Well, she wasn't the one. I don't know. I think you only get one great love in your life and... and I probably already used mine up. Red. Ahh! You are so good at this. How can I compete? You can't. Periwinkle. Oh. Well, there you go. It's not even on there. It's not on there. Bianca, hi. How are you? Well, I'm at work a few days before Christmas. But, I'm trying to rally, since I like the finer things in life, like food, and a roof over my head. Other than that, I'm good. How are you? Well, I am just trying to focus on enjoying the holidays, and planning this event. Baking. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. You baked? Well, I guess you could call it that after the first few batches. How are things there? Wendy Williams called here looking for you. She's developing a shoe line, and she wants to talk about you coming on board. Oh, right. We gave her all those shoes for her last book tour. She's huge, Maddie. And not just for her talk show, her clothing line, too. This could be major. Gosh, I don't... I don't know, Bianca. I mean, it's very flattering, but... Well, I was going to take some time and wait for my next opportunity to present itself. Maddie, if this isn't opportunity knocking, then I don't know what is. Now, if the timing isn't right for you, that's another issue. Okay, yeah, no, text me her number and I'll see what she has to say. Done. If you go back to work, you're going to take me with you, right? Of course. Oh, good. Then I'll stop working on my resume. Bye. Oh, the North Pole looks perfect there. Whoo. There you go, Tony. That's the last one, thanks. Oh. Wow. Mistletoe at a high school dance. Well, it's just a decoration. You know, tradition. Since when have you been so traditional? Well, when it became my job to give these kids a little Christmas spirit. Come on, Carter. Don't be that way. Don't be a scrooge. I am not being a scrooge. Ah, you're being a little bit of a scrooge. I resent that accusation. Bah, humbug. You better be careful, or the ghost of Christmas past will come back to set you straight. Oh, I'm pretty sure she's already here. Oh, really? Oh, look. Uh... that's uh. It's... just decorative. Yeah. Ceremonial. Mmhmm. Okay, all right. Um, here you go, Ebenezer, you're in charge. I'm going to get ready for the cookie swap. You're going? Yes. I worked so hard on those cookies, I want to see everyone's reaction. Uh, you did have help. Right. Carter. Would you like to come to the cookie Christmas swap at Jenny Pickard's house tonight? No. But I will anyway, because I heard it gets really intense and I kind of want to be there to see it. I'll see you tonight. Bah, Humbug. Wendy, hi. It's Maddie Finley returning your call. Maddie! I miss you. And by the way, I really do appreciate the box of shoes that you sent me for my book tour. But you know what? I've got an idea. I want to do shoes. You will be great at it, Wendy. You have incredible taste. You come to New York and help me do my shoe line. You've got a stake in the company. New York you miss, I know you do. And you and I will be partners. It's an exciting proposition, but... My lawyers are already drawing up the papers. You just take a look and think about it. I'll take a look at the offer. And, Wendy, thank you. I'm really flattered that you'd think of me. All right, girl. I hope you say yes. Merry Christmas, Wendy. Bye. Now, I've saved my new one for last. It's a dark chocolate fudge base, with my homemade peppermint bark on top. These cookies are amazing. Ladies. Ooh... Thank you. Mmm. Oh, mmm. I might make these for Christmas Day. Good idea. Katie loves peppermint. Sorry, Peg. Not sharing this one. Eh... isn't that the whole point of the cookie swap, Jenny? Yeah. And you can have any other recipe, just... not this one. I might mass-produce it. Ladies and gentlemen, Jenny has gone rogue. It seems our next contestant, Jenny Pickard, is pulling an ol' switcheroo on the rules. It's just a cookie. Oh, but these are special. It's rumoured that this cookie has an 8.6 degree of difficulty, but we will never know, because she is not sharing her recipe. Those snickerdoodles are my mom's special recipe and I'm sharing them. Well, that's your choice, Peg. Oh, this is unprecedented behaviour. And the crowd goes wild. And potentially disqualifying. Is this legal? Can someone check the bylaws? You're not being fair, Jenny. Well, it's my house, my rules. Ooh, it's escalating. What do you say we get outta here before it comes to blows? We can go to the cafe and get a peppermint pie. But it's just getting good. Come on, let's go. Well, maybe you'd like to host it next year, hmm? Well, perhaps I would. And perhaps I might edit the guest list. Well, you won't have my cookies. I don't know why you think your cookies are always the best, Jenny. Everyone here is a good cook. Come on! Well, you wanna walk, or drive? Oh, well let's walk. It's not that far. Do you remember when we used to walk downtown? Yeah, it didn't matter how cold it was, as long as the Christmas lights were on. I used to think Claremont was so bright you could see it from outer space. I'm pretty sure you can do that with New York. A different kind of bright. Yes, it is. Who wins in a duel? It's a draw. I don't know about that. I got an offer. A start-up shoe company. Oh. Talked to the woman today. It's definitely in my wheelhouse. guess I was just hoping that the skies would open up and, I don't know, my future would fall into my lap. Well, maybe that's what this is. Guess you just have to trust your instincts. Is that what you do? Try to. So, what do your instincts tell you about your future? I mean, what if my mom retires, or if the business doesn't work out? What's next? Uh, I don't know. I'll have to find a plan B, I guess. Starting a business is hard at first, but the feeling of accomplishment when you build something from the ground up? There is nothing like that. You know, you should see your face when you talk about this stuff. It lights up. Well, maybe it's the Christmas lights. Well, maybe you weren't ready to get rid of your business. Which would have been foolish, considering how much they offered you. You know, that's a huge testament to what you built. Well, my mother likes to say that "there are no mistakes, only decisions." I guess you'll have to figure that out when you get home. Home tonight? No, your actual home. New York. Oh yeah, right. Because New York is my home. Wow, look at this. I mean, I wish we had this as a decoration for the barn. Yeah. It'd definitely go with our theme. You just like the lights. I do, and I want it for the dance, but I'm sure it's out of our decorating budget. It's not. How do you know? I don't see a price tag. It's not for sale. I made it. This is what you've been doing in your spare time? HmmMmm. I thought you were making furniture. Nope, just tiny little houses. Are there any more of these? Of various designs. Carter, why... why don't you put this on the website? You could do special orders, ship all over the country. Hey, Carter Allen, stop! I have more questions. Yeah, course you do. You have a gift. That's not a question. Uh, okay, let me rephrase that. Why are you letting this gift go to waste? Listen, Maddie. That is a hobby. A hobby is something you do because you love it. I've already got a job where I get to utilize these same skills every single day. It's the best of both worlds. Carter. That back there, people would pay good money for that. Come on, people aren't going to buy that stuff on a regular basis. But Ca- Maddie, come on. Just let it go. Carter- I appreciate it, but let it go. Come on, cafe closes in an hour. Okay, girls. The punch bowls can go right there. Thank you. I still haven't heard anything. Well, Ava, you just submitted the application two days ago. And, it's the holidays. You said she was going to look at it right away. She probably did, and she hated them. That's it. She hates me. Ava, she doesn't hate you. You have to believe in yourself. I do, but will everyone else? Yes. I guarantee it. Found one reindeer. Oh, great. Thank you for coming by and lending a hand. Yeah, well it looked like you guys were short one left hand. Hallie thinks I'm just trying to get out of doing dishes. Oh, I could think of worse plans. I'm gonna go find his buddies. All right, good luck. What's going on here? Oh, a little, uh, decoration for the refreshment area. Hmm. Got that. You have more? I know it doesn't look much like Santa's village right now, but don't worry. I will adjust. I have props. Carter. It's perfect. You wanna know why I do this? Because of the look on people's faces. Just like yours. Come on, help me put it together. Hey. This looks like your parents' house. Oh, that's because it is. This, uh, set was originally intended to be a replica of Claremont. But don't let, uh, Mrs. Claus fool you. The coffeehouse where you get your morning latte is now Santa's office. You really love it here in Claremont. Yeah, I sure do. This is home. Here you go, Mom. Thanks, honey. The princess paper is for Katie's gifts. Yeah, I kind of figured it wasn't for Billy. Well, I'm glad I finished wrapping yours already. Mom, I told you not to spend your money on me. It's not the money. It's the joy of giving. And I love having all my family here. It's been a good week. Because of family, or something else? What are you trying to say to me, Mother? I see you and Carter. It's like you stepped right back into that old chemistry without missing a beat. I don't know. Maybe my clarity is this new job. Carter loves it here. He doesn't want to leave, and I can't stay. Why not? Everyone here has a purpose but me. I don't even know what I would do. Purpose comes in all different shapes and sizes, Maddie. Why is it, do you think, that neither you nor Carter have ever settled down? That no one was ever good enough for you? That has nothing to do with Carter and me. Maybe it's because the two of you were meant to be. Maybe what's been missing from your life all this time... is Carter. Think about it. What's that? Ahh! Is this a private party, or can anyone join in? Uh-huh, it's public property. Uh, no, actually, it's not. It's my mom's house. And we still have a lot of work to do in the barn. We don't have time for your silly little games. Who's being a scrooge now, huh? Still you. Oh! I cannot believe you fell for that. That is the oldest trick in the book. Oh, it's on now. Carter, no! No, no, no, no! Oh, no, no, no, I'm dead. Carter! Oh. Mom? You're back. Yeah, my last flight was cancelled. What is this, Ava? I got in! Maddie, you did it! Oh, well no, Ava, you did it. They... they only accept the best of the best, and that's you! I can't believe you went behind our backs and helped her with this. This isn't Maddie's fault. I was supposed to talk to you about it, and I didn't. She has a real gift, Natalie. Well, getting in is one thing. But, making a living at it is an entirely different scenario. We have a plan for her future. A good plan. No, you had a plan. It's not what I wanted. Nat. She did get in, despite the big competition. Right? And if anybody can help her navigate this experience, it's Maddie. Carter, please. It's my dream. And we're supposed to follow our dreams, right? Isn't that what you taught me, practically from birth? Well... I'm happy to tell her everything I know about the city, the institute, the art of networking to get a job. She'd have a friend in New York. It doesn't matter. She's not going. It's... it's too risky. Come on, Ava. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to overstep. No, no. You always want the best for people, and that's... that's good. There's no shame in that. All right. Time to get the little one home and fed, all with one arm, I might add. Okay. I'm going to stay here and finish this for Mom, and I will be home later. She's lucky to have you. We all are. Mmhmm. I love you. Love you. And I love you. I'll be home real soon, okay? 'Kay. One for the road. One for the road. One, one. Let's go, kiddo. Mmhmm. Hey, Billy! Hey, Katie girl! You're working late today. Yeah, I'm trying to figure out this new structural plan for Mom. She's convinced if she retires, she's going to leave us in the lurch, so I am trying to find a way to make us lurch-free. You have a really beautiful family, you know that? Thanks. I had great role models. Yes, you did. It's nice to have someone to share the trials and tribulations of life with, isn't it? Do you have anyone in New York, Maddie? I do. I... I have a lot of good friends, and fantastic ex-employees. I have a lot of "anyones" in New York, but not that one "anyone" yet. I didn't realize that was something you wanted. You're so independent and put together all the time. I guess my convenient facade worked. I just... if I could zip in and out at Christmas, I wouldn't have to face everything I was missing. But, after spending time with all of you, and the lights, and the smell of cedar at the wood shop, and oh, the drama over the peppermint bar cookie recipe. I realized I've missed a lot. And Carter? I have a thought about Carter... For business. Now, I know you don't want my advice. But his woodwork is exceptional. I know. He made this little dollhouse ornament for Katie, and it is just the cutest thing I have ever seen. Someone could fabricate Dad's furniture designs, which would free up Carter to do what he really loves. Now, again, not trying to tell you what to do with the business, because I know you've got it. No, I know. It's a good idea, Maddie. Actually, it... it might be just the thing. We could expand without changing our overhead. You know, maybe what you should do is put some pictures of his work up on the website and send out an email blast. Just to test the waters. I don't know if Carter would be okay with that. Oh, I think he would be. Especially when he saw the response. I know it's gonna be positive. All right. I'll give it a go. Good. You know that Mom made me sneak one of Jenny Pickard's peppermint bark cookies in my purse? What? Why? She's going to try and replicate it by taste. Really? And then what's she gonna do with it? She has no idea. But she's gonna show that Jenny Pickard. Well, Jenny should know better than to try to hide a cookie recipe from Peg Finley. I mean, they tasted like mint and cardboard anyway. You're a cookie spy. What is going on here? Oh, nothing. We're just reminiscing. Would you like a cookie, Mom? You cookie spy? Who made these? Jenny Pickard. Never crossing my lips. No, no, no, no, no. This colour should be perfect. Thank you for helping me get ready. My mom's not back until tomorrow, and things have been weird between us anyway. That's just because she loves you, Ava. And who knows, maybe she'll change her mind. But in the meantime, tonight is your night. Hey, are you girls ready... Ava, you look beautiful. You really do. But are you ready yet? 'Cause it's been, like, 37 hours. Carter. We've been here an hour and these things take time. Okay, I get it. But Robbie's downstairs, he's a little fidgety, and he might have a coronary if you don't get down there soon. I'm just saying. Okay, we'll be down in five minutes. He's here. You look stunning. I have one more thing for you. They're so beautiful. Well, a girl should have the perfect shoe for the perfect night. You're so lucky. You got to live your dream. Well, that's the funny thing about dreams, Ava. If you believe in them, they come true. Now, put these on, and go make your entrance. I'll meet you downstairs. How are Angie and Keith? Yeah, they're good. Good. Yeah. Tell 'em I said hi. For sure. Wow. You look... Thanks. So do you. Thanks. Uh, I brought this for you. Oh, thank you. I have something for you as well. Cool tree. Wow. You clean up nice. Oh, this old thing? Nah. It's been collecting dust in my closet since, well, since our dance, probably. Ahem. We're going to go out back now. Okay. Robbie. Want you to have her home by 11:00, okay? Yeah. 12:00. 11:30. 12:30. What? You don't negotiate up. Come on. I told your mother I'd have you home by midnight. Well then, why'd you start so low? Because I need a little wiggle room. That's how negotiations work, right? Sir, I'll have her back at her house by... sorry, what time? Midnight. Maybe a couple minutes before. We're going to be right next door. Oh, I know. I'll be watching you. And you. I'm going to definitely make sure we have that dance this evening. Oh. I would like that. ♪ Jingle jingle, ♪ ♪ jingle along with me. ♪ ♪ It doesn't matter where we go, ♪ ♪ I'm sure we'll find the mistletoe ♪ ♪ Jingle jingle, ♪ ♪ jingle along with me. ♪ ♪ It doesn't matter where you are ♪ ♪ ' Cause Christmastime is in your heart... ♪ Enjoy the dance. ♪ Jingle, jingle ♪ jingle, jingle ♪ jingle jingle Hey, let me know how this looks.

And besides, sometimes people riding the line need a little push, right? Exactly. I'll let you get back to your hostess duties. Hello. Can I have everyone's attention, please? Hi. I am Principal Kirkland, and welcome to Claremont Park High's annual Christmas Formal. Ha ha. Yes! Now. One of the things I love about this community is the fact that around here, we take care of our own. When the sprinklers went off, we thought we'd have to cancel. But Peg Finley, Carter Allen, and their families really came through for us, and I want to thank them for making tonight so special. But, on to more important matters. It is time to present our Winter Court King and Queen. Drum roll please. Ha ha, thank you. Please welcome your Queen, Ava Allen. Yes! And your King, Robbie DeMers. Thank you, sir. Ah, here we go. Ahh... Remember when that was us? Mmm. Like it was yesterday. Well, a thousand yesterdays. But who's counting? Seems like it. You know, even though we never did get to dance, it was still one of the greatest nights. Yes, it was. And now, without further ado, the Winter Court King and Queen will share a dance.

Are you, uh, relinquishing control? I'm trying. 'Kay. That shoe company wants an answer from me right after Christmas. Yeah. Okay, so. What do you think is gonna happen in the next few days that's gonna give you a little clarity on that? But I'm just going to spend some time with my family, and try not to think about the what-ifs. I don't know. I think maybe what-ifs aren't so bad. They can help you to figure out what's important. Oh, is that right? Yeah. Like, what if I had gone to New York with you? Or, what if you stayed here? Or what if I kissed you right now? What? What's wrong? I can't. What do you mean, you can't? Maddie, listen to me. This... this... this last week together, it's brought everything back for me. And... and I know you feel it too. What's the point? You live here, I live there. We can figure that out. I don't know how. But what I do know is I cannot go through another good-bye with you, Carter. I just can't do it. Maddie, listen. ♪ I am missing you this Christmas ♪ ♪ Missing you this Christmas ♪ Carter, I just want to thank you again. You've really outdone yourself. I mean, the decorations, the themes. This Santa Village set you made? I'm gonna order one for my grandson. Yeah, they're... they're not for sale. It's, uh, just something I do on the side. That's not what the website said. The website? What website? Your company website. I got an email today saying you were expanding into other forms of woodworking. Your own personal hand-carved crafts? Excuse me for a second. Uh, absolutely. Hey, Merry Christmas. Can I join you? I'm afraid I won't be very good company right now. Did you know that when your father first proposed to me, I said no? What? How did I not know that? I didn't like to bring it up around him. He hated that I could have potentially ruined everything. But why would you say no? I've never seen two people more in love than you and Dad. I was young. I was scared. More you have in life, the more you have to lose. But as I thought about it, I realized that love like that can fill you up for a lifetime, no matter how long it lasts. And even if that was all I was ever going to get in life, I'd take it, thank you very much. You were right, Mom. It's Carter. It's always been Carter. You should listen to your mother more often. He's a risk worth taking, isn't he? I think so. Now, get back inside, find Carter, and let's all enjoy Christmas as a family. Thanks, Mom. Thanks. Go, go, go! Go. Hallie! Have you seen Carter? No, not in a while, but he's pretty upset with us, Maddie. Why, what happened? Well, I sent out that email blast today, and he found out about our plan. I... I... I just think we should've talked to him first. Oh, Hallie, I'm so sorry. But I'll fix it. Thank you. Oh. Excuse me, Ava. Have you seen your uncle? He went back to the house a bit ago, but I haven't seen him since. Okay, thanks. You guys look so cute in the crowns. Hey. Let me explain. No, no, no, no. Look, there's no need to explain, okay? If we aren't reaching what Maddie Finley feels is our greatest potential, then we're not good enough, I get it. I never said that. You know, with... with all due respect, I don't think you should be telling people what they should and shouldn't be doing with their gifts, okay? But I... I... I pushed so hard because I believe in you. You just, you don't... you don't understand, do you? All of this? This is enough for me. Okay? I... I... I know that it's not enough for you, I know that I wasn't enough for you, and that this has always been our problem. But this is enough for me. Only one of us thinks that. But I will not apologize for following my dreams. And I will never apologize for the greatness I see in you. I just, I just hope one day you see it in yourself. Blue. Red. Green. Oh well. Can't win 'em all. Hi. You okay? Mom, I'm gonna take that job in New York. I'm gonna leave after Christmas morning. It's what I do right. I came here, and I made a mess of everything. For Carter, for Ava, even trying to help with the family business. Building something new, that's what I do. That is what I'm good at. If that's what you need to do, then I support you 100 percent. Thank you. Sweetie. Sleep well. I'll be up in a minute. Red. Morning, Carter. Hey. Good morning. Nothing like, uh, waiting until Christmas Eve to get my shopping done. Not that I really had a choice with you cracking the whip this Christmas. Oh, come now. I'm kidding. Hey, uh, where are you going? Let me help you with these. Oh, thank you. Um, I'm parked just right there. Okay. You know, Peg, I've been thinking. Mmhm? You've been so good to me all these years. You've treated me like a member of your family and if you want me to start focusing on my own designs, and you think that'll help grow the business, then... then I'm in. I'll do it. I want you to do whatever would make you happy, Carter. What? Oh, nothing. I was just... just thinking. You know, I was always so sure that Maddie was gonna be successful. I just wasn't sure that I was gonna have what it takes. Well, of course you do. The only person who wasn't sure about that was you. Maddie is a pretty powerful person, she is so determined and smart and capable. Sometimes I wonder where she even came from. Right. But what I don't wonder about is that she loves you, and has since the day you two met. I can never give her the life she always wanted. Not then, not now. She had that life already, Carter. Guess what, she doesn't want it anymore. She's decided to take that job offer. Unless, of course, someone can convince her otherwise. Carter, the only way you could hold that girl back is by not being with her. Hey. Come on in. Mom said you're leaving tomorrow, after Christmas morning? Yeah. Hallie, I'm sorry if I made things difficult for you. I should have stayed in my own lane and kept my big mouth shut. Actually, I came here to tell you, you were right. About what? The business. The second I put Carter's work up on the website and sent out that email blast, we got dozens of inquiries. Maddie, you're better at this than I am, at seeing the big picture. No, I'm not. We see things differently, but there are benefits to both perspectives. No, Dad always hoped you'd come back and run the business someday. That's not true. Dad was very proud of how you ran the business after he retired. I know, but I still wasn't you. And that ate away at me, which was unfair, because it wasn't your fault, or Dad's. I just, I couldn't let it go. I couldn't forgive you for leaving. Oh, Hallie. It was hard for me to leave you, too. Hard for me to leave all of you. I looked up to you so much, and all of a sudden, my sister was gone. I know that you've decided to take this job, but I really think you should turn it down. You need to run Dad's company. Not me. This is your birthright, Maddie. No. It's not my birthright, it's our birthright. Hallie. That's it. We should run Dad's company together. Are you serious? I have never been more serious about anything. I have loved being home, and celebrating with all of you. And... and there has been a lightness to me this week, I can't remember the last time I felt like that. And even though Carter is now the one who hates me, well he can just deal. You really mean this? I do. I have been looking for my clarity, and you just handed it to me. Well, you're welcome. It's good to have you home, Maddie. It's nice to be home. Another 30 minutes for the turkey, and Ava should be back from last-minute shopping in a few, and some of your early work. Ah... What's wrong? That face is not fit for Christmas Eve. I'm just thinkin'. Maddie? Yeah, among other things. Do you think I play it too safe? Yes. Of course. I do too. It's our greatest character flaw as a family. Why? You know, what are we afraid of? You know, if... if I take a chance on myself, if you send Ava to New York, if I tell Maddie how I feel. What... what... what's... what's the worst that could happen? Heartbreak? Okay, yeah, but there's another side to that coin too, right? Yeah. We seem to forget to flip it over, don't we? Yes, we do. Hey guys. Hey. Ava. You win. You're going to New York. What? Really? You heard me. I cannot deprive you from what is meant to be in your life. Thank you, thank you, thank you! Go get 'em, kid. I'm gonna go call Ashley. Okay. I did it. Now it's your turn. Oh. Well played, Nat. - MmmHmm, yeah. - Well played. You looking for your watch? You know, funny thing about this watch. It's actually really hard to get off. Requires a lot of effort. See, I knew it. You're a terrible liar. Maddie, you can't go. Okay? You can't take that job in New York. I want you to come inside and just hear me out. It's okay. You can say whatever you need to say to me right here. Okay. You were right about me. And I want to try and work on my own stuff, and if it doesn't work out, then I don't know, I'll find... I'll find something else. But it's a risk I'm willing to take. I am really happy to hear that. In fact, my whole family's turning over a new leaf. Ava? Yeah. Yeah. She's gonna need your guidance when it comes to New York. Well, I will be there every step of the way. It'll have to be long distance, though. What do you mean? I thought you were taking that job. I did take a job. But not the one in New York. I'm gonna run the company with Hallie here in Claremont. You're staying? What's with the suitcase? Oh, that? That's a Christmas present for my Mom. Hallie and I are sending her to Paris. You know, I am so tired about worrying about what-ifs. You know, what if my... my business doesn't succeed, what if I fail, or what if... All of that is irrelevant. I realized that there's only one thing that I need to be concerned with. And that's what if I lose you again. That is not a risk that I am willing to take, not this time. Me neither. So, we're doing this? A couple of decades late, but yes, we're doing this. ♪ Ring, ring, ring, there goes the bell ♪ ♪ Even so I just want to tell and sing you Noel ♪ ♪ This Christmas has come and gone ♪ ♪ Let's still sing those holiday songs ♪ ♪ Mistletoe's moved out of sight ♪ ♪ But will you give me a kiss... ♪
