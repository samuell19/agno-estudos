Not entirely. I said I was ambitious, but I was anything but an opportunist. After all, I spent 10 years in Paris just having fun. So what are we talking here, a love affair?

Nothing is cruel that fulfills your promise. Oh, God. I've been promising all my life. I've got a notebook full of promise. Trunks full. I want to be more than promising to you. We could fulfill your promise together. We could be singular as a couple. Would you stay for dinner? It will be just us. I'd like that. GABE: So, did you love her then? ELDERLY COLE: Then? I don't know. I thought I might discover what love was. The physical side was always... Well, we could take it or leave it. It was pleasant enough. But the intimacy was stunning. Good morning. What's that? Um, it's, uh, an idea for a song. (HUMMING) This part, right here, I think would go nicely with "I love you." What do you think? I think that would be beautiful. I do, you know.

Well, there's a certain section of the bar here. The left side, I think, significantly enough, where your groom and his gentleman friends like to call on each other. I assumed, for symbolic purposes at least, that the wedding would be held there. I had to assume, you see, since my invitation never arrived. I would invite you to hell. No need. Already there. Too bad you never cared for it. In spite of caring for you once... Oh, my fault, then. You offered care, I needed passion. What does the fawn need? Can you supply him? Surely not with everything. And what can he give you? Pride. Don't turn your back on me, Mrs. Thomas. That's so funny. From what I remember, it was the position you most favored. Are you all right? I'm fine. EDWARD: Wait. Mr. Thomas, you have the most peculiar sense of timing. You think you can make her happy just because you won't violate her delicacy? Because you don't need her as a woman? Ah, um...

To be inconsiderate, to ignore your obligations. (WHISPERING) I know. I'm so sorry, I really am. That was unforgivable. Cole, you disappointed a lot of people last night. The London producers were there. Some Hollywood people were most anxious to speak with you. I don't want to go to Hollywood, and I don't want to fight. I don't want to fight. And I don't want to blame. Thank you for that, dear. But if things are gonna be different, I'd like to know. I'll tell you as soon as I know. GABE: You must have known already. I got the ending.

No, you probably don't. Which reminds me, how's Linda? COLE: She's all right. A bit more fragile than usual, but all right. How's Patrick? Well, there's a doctor in Zurich who may give us more time. GERALD: They don't give you much hope with tuberculosis. So sorry. Does Linda know? She hasn't said anything. Yeah. GERALD: She said, "We live in castles built on sand."

He's exploiting both of us. Well, yes. I like to look at it as a kind of luxury tax. A luxury tax? What an extraordinary thing to say. Do you have any idea how much you've changed? How much your behavior has changed? You have put everything that you've accomplished with your music at risk. Darling, my work has never been better. It's flourishing. Even if we're not. Your music comes from your talent, not from your behavior. It's all the same thing. I can't put my talent here and my behavior here and my eating, sleeping, and drinking habits. It's all me. I have never asked you to change. Just be discreet. Linda, I have never been discreet. What is discretion but dishonesty wrapped up in a little good breeding? I don't think you want me to be discreet, Linda, I think you want me to be different. I am partially responsible for all of this because I have spoiled you, I have indulged you. But so has the entire goddamned world. And for what? Just a little music. ELDERLY COLE: Linda hated being late for anything. And the next day she was late for lunch. I only had to hear the clock strike and look at her empty place at the table to know she was gone. Gone back to Paris. It's quite simple, really. Two people who wanted too much from each other. (PHONE RINGING) Porter residence. Hold one moment. Sir. Not now. It's urgent, sir. Yes? ELDERLY COLE: All the money, all the music had deflected reality for so long, I didn't know that everything we had was so fragile. GABE: Hold it loose, hold it tight. Everything breaks. I'm going to take them to Paris next week. All of this is just... (SIGHS) Got to get back to a better place. And, uh, it would be good to see Linda. (PIANO PLAYING) IRVING: Morning, Cole. Are we the only ones up? Our hostess just retired. I've been up since 5:00. (CHUCKLING) Writing another hit, I'm sure. I wish it was that easy. Nothing comes easy anymore. And when it does, it's lousy. I write better in my own place or the Murphys'. I'm going to swear off these house parties until I finish this score. Remind me I said that, will you? That melody sounds like it could go somewhere. Yeah, like out for a drink. Have you heard from Linda? No. No. I've written, I've wired, I've called. Nothing. I'm sorry, Cole, I'm really sorry. Maybe, uh, you know, with time... It'll take more than time. (CLEARS THROAT) I, uh... I'll be back before breakfast. (WIND WHISTLING) Just seemed so much to ask children to bear.

MOORHEAD: I'm afraid his right leg should be amputated. Perhaps the left as well. There's really no alternative. If you amputate his legs, you will cut out his pride. You'll break his spirit, he would never work again. He'll have nothing without his music, it's the essence of him. He'd have nothing to live for. He would have his life, his friends, you. Nothing. He would just be living out his death. You're asking a lot of him. We are accustomed to asking a lot of one another. So what did the sawbones say? You get to keep the old things. And he expects you to walk, and so do I. But only if I can walk to you. As far as Williamstown? Williamstown? Massachusetts. I found a very pretty home. LINDA: It's on a hill, it has a work space. Thinking of buying it. LINDA: A little bump. Oh. All right. Now? Yes. COLE: Oh, a grand piano. That is grand. (CHUCKLES) That's not quite right. So shall I leave you to it? Guess you'd better. God, I can't work the pedal... Can't work the pedals, dear. (PLAYING PIANO) (EXCLAIMS) Goddamn it! (SOBBING) COLE: I can't work the pedals! GABE: And what did it take to finally work the pedals? Oh, a few years. A pharmacopoeia of pills. A reservoir of scotch and 20 more operations. Nonstop fun. But over time, you got five shows up and running. Up? Yes. Running? Barely. COLE: At least, according to the critics. "Not up to Mr. Porter's usual standards," was the refrain. So when Hollywood finally called again? Oh, I was on the train before the second ring.

(GROANS) Sorry. I'm all right. Why on earth does Linda come back to Cole anyway? Because he's Cary Grant. And she misses the music, as do I. I must say, going down in history as Cary Grant is not too bad. COLE: Not for a boy from Indiana. LINDA: We should be grateful to them, they found us a happy ending. COLE: Ah, yes, happy endings. Well, you don't get many of those, do you, in Hollywood? COLE: So this promises what, surgery number 25? Twenty Six. Oh, good God. And how long will I have to wear the cast this time? A few months, we'll see how you mend. What's that? It's Linda. It's gotten that bad now? Even if she'd agree, I don't think surgery would help. The lungs are too damaged.
