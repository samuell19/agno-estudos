One sunny afternoon towards the end of the Second World War I didn't scare you did I? Yes, but it doesn't matter - Can I help you? - Yes, thank you Let me go Why? Don't you like it? When my father gets back he'll punch your face in Holding your thigh feels beautiful, believe me Pig! I saw all that, you know Her skin is like silk Then go off with her and starve And then... what would you do? I paid the drinks bill Are you mad? Well my love, if the bill seems too high, I can get that little girl to give me a discount Time passes quickly Soon you'll have to pay for it too, like me You sound like my mother You're a pimp You made a mistake! Why do you want to scare me? I had a dream... About my family - They're all dead, you know? - Yes, I know - My son was great at math - Really? He had a diploma He was about your age - Are you scared to die, Miss Julia? - Excuse me, I have to help mother Wait... They died in the bombing, don't you want to know? Question... The land covers an area of 44 hectares, and the owner sells 13... - Is everyone in the hotel? - I think so - Done your homework? - Yes, mother Good When you finish your studies, with or without the hotel, you'll survive Look at these potatoes Still, it's a miracle we have any It's getting harder and harder to find food Make the skins thinner, we'll use them for coffee Mom, I don't like our guests I don't like them either but we've got to keep the hotel running You're right mother, I'm sorry - Seen Alfredo? - No, I've not He's never here when there's something to do Fry the potatoes, I'll see if he laid the table I'll be right back Alfredo?

You're so ridiculous Good evening, everyone - Are you eating? - Yes Why not eat? You're losing weight What's wrong? Scared I won't get it up anymore? - Hello there - Hello - Have you eaten yet? - No, we just got here I've got a joke for you About the Marquise and the parrot, do you know it? - No - It's too dirty Look who's talking! If you saw what she does in bed It's true, she does everything, she and her sister are phenomenal - I've never seen the like - And you know your stuff Just like the black girl. You knew her, right? Well, it's the same It's awful, mama You're right But it's money, Julia War is tough for hotels We can't afford to lose customers It's her who supports him She must be rich, eh? Well, you know... The planes... they're really close tonight Quiet! - My God! What can we do? - Stay calm Bring the candles Hurry... I've waited all day, I'm starving - Are you crazy? Let's go inside! - Turn off the light Marta, I can't stay here like this It's not my fault you have to hide You think they're still looking for me? After what you've done... I pray they never find you They never will When the war's over it'll all be annulled The day'll come when I can leave here Listen... last night... I heard a car arriving... and then it left - Did you hear it? - No I sleep at night I never sleep - Look how your hair's grown - What do I care about my hair? Marta, stay with me a while No Not tonight, please I'm tired, I've been working all day Julia... Give me a kiss One kiss... Just one Why do you hate me? If you touch me I'll tell my mother I'm about to close a big deal. I'll have money Don't play hard to get I know you want it Come on, don't be silly Women go crazy for me Come with me and I'll dump the old lady I'll make you a lady We'll see the world - You weren't born to be in a kitchen - Leave her alone!

I know that sometimes it's hard but while I'm here you needn't be afraid of anything How grown up you are A broken neck, like my wife You're crazy coming here I heard footsteps but I didn't know it was you, so I hid in the cupboard Leave her alone! Don't touch her! She's mine too Get out. Get out now I was waiting for you I wanted to tell you I'm right by your side Yes, I'm alone too I understand you better Excuse me, I'm very tired I understand, Miss Julia I've suffered a lot too How I suffered when I found my son under the rubble He spent two days screaming And my wife... If you'd seen her... Her mouth bleeding, like a broken doll I'm sorry, I can't help you right now I like talking to you, Miss Julia Did you hear how my wife and son died? It was quite shocking. Come on, I'll tell you You must be strong Julia I know what you think I'm in your hands now You won't betray me, will you? Did your mother ever tell you why I'm hiding here? Yes, she told me She probably exaggerated Like always Lately... she exaggerated so much, I think she hated me You don't believe me, do you? You're all I have Just you, Julia! I'm lonely as a dog I'm scared... All I have is you Don't do this again Julia? Julia... Open the door Don't be silly.

You heard me with the old lady You know I'm good Open up, Julia Open up Rodolfo, where are you? - Good Morning - Julia! What a surprise, come in No, I can't trust you You know, I'd be risking my life for a dozen eggs I can't do it out of charity It's cash, or nothing I can't make exceptions, even for you My mother used to get credit It was different with her, you must understand She came directly to me to settle accounts... personally If my father were here you wouldn't say this Convince yourself, he's not coming back Over 50% die in wars, isn't that right, mother? Not my father! Uncle, you disgust me Go get the wine These kids... Julia... I'm sorry about your mother Thanks My father's in the war too - Don't worry, he'll come back - If you need anything, ask me Thank you Goodbye Goodbye Rodolfo... are you asleep? Do you remember New Year at Monte Carlo? So much champagne What a night, the orchestra playing just for us We were so happy together. Such great times... I don't like this hotel. Why can't we move out? You don't reply? I know why Because you're after that servant girl That's why you're so cold with me You want to leave me, I can feel it But it won't be so easy I'll cut off your balls Instead of removing my balls, why don't you get out those 4 jewels of yours? The jewels... You're the only one who knows. But the jewels are not for sale Those jewels... We'll sell them one at a time When I had money... And now... What can I do? My love Why do you treat me like this? Please... Please, Rodolfo, you know I'd do anything for you Look in the mirror It's sad Breakfast One moment Come in No, over here We'll talk about this later Wait! Where do you think you're going? Listen to me I saw it with my own eyes, you led him on I didn't You like him It's true... he's a demon in bed But he's mine, you get it? Mine! - Leave him alone! - Stop it! Touch her again and I'll beat you to death Get off me! Let me go, you coward - Julia - Guido, what are you doing? I've a surprise for you, come see Guido... what have you got? Stuff I pinched off my uncle, flour and potatoes What if he notices? Help me Inside Don't get upset, I want to say something No Guido, not now Tell me after the war, when my father's back But will your father let me see you? He's a good man Tell me... have you been studying since school closed? Yes I haven't. I can't, there's too much to do here Wait... What's going on? I came to say it's dinner time, Miss Julia - They've been waiting half an hour - I'm coming now Wait Stay there Now Thanks Guido, come back soon So, what's happening today? We're not eating?

A room with two beds... clean I'm sorry, we can't take on new guests We don't have the staff, I'm alone Room 45, dinner at 8 The passports Give them to me Give me those passports Calm down, I'll hold on to these First the jewels Finish him off Those men... Who are they? How should I know? These people... How long do you want to stay here?

You're the only one who can help me Find out who they are... and what they want You'll do that won't you? Don't play with me, Julia!

It's all yours, when you give us the stones You'll have them tomorrow And the old lady? She thinks I'll marry her The passports? What if the old lady catches you going to Switzerland? - Don't make me laugh - You'll be off with the money What if she finds out? The lake. There's always the lake What was that?

Alfredo, I'm scared Alfredo? Who's there? Alfredo, is it you? What's up? My God, what's wrong with you? Come on, come with me Don't be afraid, I'm here I know what it's like to feel alone To be scared You poor thing My heart breaks to know you have no mother Before, I was jealous of you, now I want to hold you in my arms You're just a scared child It almost makes me want to tell you a story as if you were my daughter Come, don't be afraid Come with me... Nothing will happen to you, come... That's it, sit here Just a second Now Rodolfo can't come in My dear... I'm sorry for the fuss I made earlier Sometimes he makes me lose my mind He drives me crazy But you're still shaking... What happened? Won't you tell me? Why did you cry out? Was it Rodolfo again?
