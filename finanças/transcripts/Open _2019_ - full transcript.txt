[Ethan] You don't agree? Do you have other solutions? [Rome] Are you serious? [Ethan] Yes, I'm serious! [Ethan stammers] What can I do? I know that you won't agree to this. You know what? If you don't want to, then let's not do it. Fourteen years? Maybe we should just end this. [shouts] You want to do this, right? -Do you? -[sobs] Because you do! -You do! -No, but do you? -So? -[sobbing] Fine! I do! -I do. I do. -Okay. Shh, babe. Fine! -[Rome crying] Fine! -[Ethan] Babe... Wake up! -[Ethan moans] -Get up! [Rome] Babe! Babe! Hey! [shouts] [grunts] You... Ouch! Come on! We have to get ready. [grunts] -Hm. -Thank you. Babe? Where's my...? Thank you. I hate high heels. [Ethan] Babe? Babe, what's going on? Which one's better? Babe, I've been waiting for you in the car. It's too early yet you're so grumpy! [Ethan chuckles] -Just drive faster than usual. -It's alright. Ready? [staff] Good morning, Ma'am. Good morning, Sir. I want the one with strawberries. I think matcha's better. Matcha tastes like dirt. Who would want that? My mother. Oh, okay. Fine. Let's get one matcha and one strawberry. Actually, salted caramel looks nice too. Fine. Then get salted caramel and strawberries. Why do you want strawberries? They're freshly picked. -Sure? -Yes. [tongue clicks] Let's ask the staff. Miss, where do you get your strawberries? [staff] From the farm of the café owner, Ma'am. See? Fine, strawberries and matcha. What about your salted caramel? One salted caramel and one matcha then. -What about my strawberries? -[stammers] Babe, you know what? You choose. Just make it quick. Mom's waiting. [Estelle] Try this. -I really love their matcha. -Delicious. Finish the cake. -Mom, is this from White Plains? -Yes. You know, their strawberry cake is very good. They get the strawberries from their own farm. [woman] I've tried that too. That's really good. -But the salted caramel... -[mouths] Told you. is nothing special. [laughter] [clears throat] Shiela, how's your maternity shoot going? It will still push through. Unbelievable! Fifteen thousand, six sets. But that's for the whole day. Whoa! Memories truly cost a lot. -[Carmen] Yes. -Fifteen thousand? That's why you two, you should start saving up for your wedding. [all] True. Yes, Romina. Don't you want to marry Ethan? Don't you want us to be your family members officially? I think Ethan... does not want to get married yet. [chuckles] -[mumbles] -Where are you going? -Finish your food. -I'll just get some wine. [Ethan]Babe, last round, okay? Archie's waiting for us. We can't be late. -Dad, wine? -[Dad] Sure. [Ethan] I'll just get some. -Hello. -Excuse me. Bro! Are you ready? Hi, Rome! Are you ready? Huh? Because we're ready! -Come on. -What's up? -What is it? -Huh? -Um... -[Monique] Hey. -What is it? -Hey. -Rome. -Hello. Your dress looks lovely. Are you dressed for a special occasion? What occasion? Um, guys, gather around! -Come closer! -Let's go! Let's go! [chuckles] Uh, guys, I'm really sorry we're late and we made you wait. I'm here to share with you this very special occasion. Thank you all very much for coming. And as I said earlier... Tonight is not just an ordinary night. Something that we've all been waiting for is about to happen. Your presence means a lot to my best friend, Archie. Arch? Monique. [clamoring] [cheering] [Archie clears throat]Ever since I laid my eyes on you in La Union, I knew. I knew that... [coughs] you're that girl I want to be with until my very last breath. [crowd squealing] Monique Isabella Gonzales, will you marry me? [gasping] Yes! Yes! [Archie]She said yes! [all cheering] I thought you were going to propose to me earlier. -[chuckles] Really? -Yeah. Why? -And it wasn't just me. -Oh! That's why they all got shocked when you called Archie. -[laughs] -They all looked away. [laughs] Oh, shit! Too bad! I didn't see their reactions. [laughing] -You find it funny, huh? -Sorry, babe. It's because I was the one who gathered them. Sorry. Sorry, babe. You really expected? Of course. Don't we act married already? Right, babe? I mean, is that really necessary? It's just paper. A pricey one at that. [sighs] My god. Fine! Since you seem to not have a plan anyway. Babe. Of course, I have plans. Just not now. The way you said it seemed like you don't have plans at all. [Rome] Don't you want to be with me forever? Babe, you know I do. I love you. I love you too. I love you more. I love you most. Sorry, sorry. Niño, you still owe me! Today's the deadline! Okay, 12:00 p.m. What? No parking? Man, there's none. -Did boss look for me? -I don't think so. Ms. Sanchez and Ms. Erika are the only bosses here. Oh, Erika. Don't forget to e-mail it to me as soon as possible. -Will do, Ms. Sanchez. -Thank you. Hey, congrats! You will be perfect in the vacant desk beside mine. Oh, didn't Ms. Sanchez tell you? -Oops! -What is it, Ms. Erika? All I can say is enjoy your remaining days beside Daniel. And you're late, again. -Have a good day. -Have a good day. Sorry. Oh! Good morning. Wow! Congrats! -Buy me a drink. Buy me a drink. -[laughs] Treat us to dinner! [laughs] [Rome] Hello? [Ethan] Hey, babe! I'll pick you up later. Let's have dinner. I have good news for you. What is it? I'll tell you at dinner. Babe, it's only lunch time. I'll wonder what the good news is the whole day. [Ethan]I'm a general manager now! [gasps] Congrats! Congrats, babe! Okay, see you! See you later! I can't wait! [Ethan]I'll pick you up at six. -Okay. Love you. -[Ethan] I love you too. -Love you more. -Hey. -[Ethan] I love you most. -[gasps] Okay, bye. -See you. Love you. -[phone thuds] What's the big news? Mind sharing it? Ethan just got promoted. Finally. [chuckles] Wow! Oh, my gosh! Congrats! I'm happy for the two of you. Thank you. Cheers! -Cheers! -Congratulations! -[glass clinks] -Thanks, babe. This was long overdue but didn't I tell you all your sacrifices will eventually pay off? -I'm so proud of you. -Thank you. [giggles] And you know what they told me, babe? I'm the fastest to get promoted to general manager in my company. Seven years is fast? [sighs] Well, finally, I'll have my own parking space. -Yehey! I'm so happy for you. -[chuckles] Thank you. [Rome] Babe? I want to tell you something too. Hm? -But don't get mad, okay? -[growls] -[Ethan grumbles] -[Rome giggles] I'm kidding. What is it? I have an offer abroad. Carla wants me to be the creative director of our partner company in Singapore. Wow! That's great! It's great news! But I don't think I'll accept the offer. Why not? Why don't you try it? How many years have you been a senior copywriter? -Four years. -[Ethan] See. You got promoted faster than me. But Singapore is far. And LDR is difficult. I won't be able to check up on you. [utensils clanging] Why do you need to check up on me? I just don't want to leave you alone in our new condo. I don't mind being alone in the condo. [Rome] I don't want to accept the offer. [chuckles] Why does it seem like you want me to leave? I'm just making things easy for you because that's what you really want to say, right? Aren't we here to celebrate? [Rome] We're celebrating your promotion, right? -Why are we fighting? -You started it. Me? I didn't mean anything bad by it. I just don't want to leave you alone. Because you need to check up on me. Because you don't trust me. Until now, Rome? [Ethan] You still haven't forgotten my mistakes? Rome. Wait. Rome. Rome. Romina. Sorry. [sighs] I'm sorry too. I shouldn't have brought it up. It's fine. [sniffles] [car engine revving] [sirens, horns blaring] Crap. Damn. Monique? E! This must be good. Are you okay? How long have you and Monique been together? Three years. Why? [exhales] Okay. Dude, I saw her. This morning. Outside a condo. -She's with a girl. -Okay. I saw Monique kissing a girl. She's cheating on you. And she's gay. She's cheating on me... [laughs] Wait. First off, Monique... is not gay. She's bi. What? And since you already found out about us, Monique and I are open. What? Meaning, we are welcome to meet other people. To be intimate with them as long as there's no emotions attached. At the end of the day, we'll go home to each other. -What the crap? -I know, right? Okay, wait. I don't get it. You and Monique are getting married. Yeah. And you'll continue this set-up even after the wedding? We already talked about that. I think we can manage. -Damn! Wild! -[laughs] [Archie chuckles] I know. [stammers] So, wait. How about you? You can sleep with other people too? Yes. And she knows? Yes. And you know, I've never been in a relationship or a set-up that is so liberating, respectful, and loving as this. I'll get some food. -Do you want anything? -None. -Are you okay? -Yes. [voice over PA] Which is better? Since when did you like dresses? I should have brought my sister instead of you. I thought we were going to buy blinds for the condo. That's why I accompanied you. I'll just try this out and then we'll go find blinds. This will be quick. [voice over PA] Dear shoppers, thank you for shopping and have a nice day. Annoying! [voice over PA]Calling the parents of a lost boy wearing white T-shirt... Hm. Hi, Ms. Erika. Ethan! What are you doing here? I'm with Rome. She's fitting a dress. -Babe? -[Ethan] Boyfriend duties. [Erika] Yup. You are a dutiful boyfriend. [laughs] Actually, we're here to buy blinds. We're looking for a furniture shop. Do you know a good shop? -I think there's one downstairs. -Babe! -Not sure. -Babe! Hey. Zip me up. Okay. Babe, Ms. Erika, remember? Yes, we've met before. Rome? -Hi! -Christmas party? -That's right. -[laughter] You're shopping? Yes. Ethan's getting bored actually. It's a good thing you're here. Shopping for what? His sister's baby shower. You know what? I saw something that would look perfect on you. Come. -Let's check it out. -Hm? Come on. Yes, that one. This will look good on her. -Wow. -Right? It's so nice. Rome. This one is perfect for you. It's simple but it will highlight your beauty. This will accentuate your figure. -You're right. -Right? So, what do you think, Rome? Oh, thank you. [whispers] Thank you. Oh, you know what? I have to go. Nice to see you again, Rome. -I'll see you at the office. -Bye. -Bye. -Bye, Ms. Erika. So, blinds? Babe? Hm? Babe... Does it fit me well? Come here. You know what looks better on you? No clothes. More, babe. You can do it. More, babe. [Ethan] Sorry, babe. I'm just tired. Call me Erika. Babe? Call me Erika. Erika. Erika. [whispers] Wait. Wait. [groans] You know what? I don't understand you. We rarely have sex. And you're ruining it with your insecurities. -Do you like Erika? -[groans] What? You had sex with her? -Come on! -Are you sleeping with her? -What the hell? Romina! -What? Oh, my god! Do you want to have sex with her? What if I say yes? No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Babe, what I'm trying to say is what if... [Rome sobs] ...what if we're bored with each other, huh? What if I'm getting bored? Well then, I'm sorry. No, no. You're not walking out. No! Babe! You may not believe me now. Babe, you may not believe me now, -but I want to fix this. -[sobs] I love you and I want us to fix this. [sobs] I spoke with Archie the other day. What does Archie have to do with this? Just listen to me, okay? Hear me out. I saw Monique with another girl. Yes, Monique is bisexual. And you know what else? They're in an open relationship. It's just sex. They're still committed to each other at the end of the day. Archie doesn't have trust issues anymore. Monique also became happier with their relationship. And they barely fight. Look, they're getting married soon. Babe. What if we try it too? You'll have sex with other people? -Babe, not just me. You too. -Huh? Babe, all your life, it was just me. Don't you think that maybe the reason we're getting bored is because of that? You will have sex with other people to fix this? -Huh? That easy? -[stammers] You disagree? Why? Do you have other solutions? Are you serious? You're asking me? Yes! But what can I do? I know that you won't agree to this. Seriously? [sobs] Babe... [breathing heavily] You know what? If you don't agree to this, then let's not do it. Fourteen years? Maybe it's about time we end this. I'm sure you'll find someone. Men will fall in line for you. You'll find someone better. Better than me. Someone who'll love you, who'll take care of you and will give you the world. [whispers] No. What? [sobs] Babe, please. Please, I want us to fix this. Please. Babe, I do too. Please. I don't want to break up with you. I don't want to lose you. [sniffles] What do you think? Are you serious? Babe, are you really serious? You want an open relationship? Seriously? You know what? Forget it. Let's not do it. -Fine! Let's do it! -But you're half-hearted. [sobbing] No, sure! Let's do it! Fine! Let's do it. Okay, game. What do you want to know? [sighs] So... How does sleeping with other people help my relationship with Ethan? [Monique] Before we get into that, I want you to know that an open relationship isn't for everyone. I mean it works for some. It strengthens their relationship. It makes things more exciting. And for others, it causes break-ups. And you should be okay with those risks. Are you? What if I am? What next? Rome, you have to be sure. It's very important that this is your choice as much as it is Ethan's. Don't let him bully you into doing this. He didn't... He didn't force me but the idea came from him. And I'm not saying that Ethan's right. Especially with his history. But I understand why he wants this. But I will also understand if you tell me that you can't do it. Just tell me. How will this setup help us? Well, the best part is our sex is amazing. Especially when we tell each other how we do it with others. We feel more aroused. And our connection's stronger than ever. Everything else just followed. Trust and respect. [chuckles] We even fixed our insecurities individually and as a couple. We're happier now. Not that! This one's bigger. There! Did you agree to this because you want it bigger? -Babe. -Just kidding. What did Monique say? Nothing. She just said that there should be transparency at all times. And she said that it will help if we establish some rules. But she said not to make it too detailed for us not to miss the fun. Hmm. Exciting. Which goes without saying that this is purely physical fun. No feelings involved and no strings attached. It sounds so weird coming from you. Do you want this or not? I do. It was my idea. I just want it to be clear that this was your idea. So we know who to blame if this blows up. Babe, can we add in our rules that there's no blaming in the end? Is that okay? It's purely fun. Okay, fine. Just don't tell anybody. [Ethan] Okay. And you can only have sex with strangers. Never with people we know. Yes, Ma'am. [sighs] [Rome] Where can I find a guy? On HookApp. Babe, look. He's handsome. You're okay with it even if he's more handsome than you? Of course. I only want the best for you. He's asking me out already. Go, babe. Do it. I'll go out tonight too. I'm with Archie. We're going together. Babe. We're so mature about this. Where can you find a boyfriend driving his girlfriend to her date? [laughs] I don't know how to go out on a date anymore. Then don't think of it as a date. Think of it as a job interview. What is he applying for? -Sex assistant? -[laughs] Something like that. Just try it so you can keep things professional. [Ethan] Babe, we're still us. Okay? I'm still yours. And don't worry about it. Last rule. We can stop anytime, okay? If this doesn't work, we'll stop this. [chuckles] Okay. Go ahead. Your applicant is waiting for you. [indistinct chattering] -Hey. -Ouch. You're really maximizing being legal, huh. -Awesome! -Hey! -Hey! -Boys night out? -Hey! -Hey, Ms. Erika. You're here. -Obviously. -Uh-huh. Do I look like a ghost? Pinch me. And you are? -Ar... -Archie. My best friend. And, Archie, this is Ms. Erika. -Erika? -Erika, remember? -Erika. -Yeah. -My co-worker. -Co-worker sounds so formal. Who's with you? -No one. -[Archie] No one? With your beauty, you shouldn't be alone. You know, Archie, I am an independent woman. I don't need boys. -Boys need me. [chuckles] -Oh, crap. I need you. Can I propose to you? Hey, hey! You're already engaged. [Archie] Engaged? Do you see any ring on me? Huh? -Excuse me. I'll be back. -[Archie] Wait! Where are you going? You're too clingy. I'll just go to the restroom. Wanna come with me? It's a joke! [sighs] Damn you, bro! If you don't have any plans with Erika, give her to me please. No, I don't have any plans. One of the rules Rome and I set. We can't do it with people we know. Damn. So, what now? I'll take one for the team? Huh? Okay? Huh? What the hell! Why aren't you answering? You and Rome just started. Are you planning to break the rules this soon? Don't be like that, bro. -Don't be like that, bro. -Don't touch me. [utensils clanking] You look like you have a lot of experience already. [chuckles] I would say average. For a guy my age. Mm. But how often is enough for you? Hm... Ah, twice or three times a week. What's your favorite dessert? Anything with chocolates. -Sex or chocolates? -[both laugh] Seriously? Ethan, you don't have to bring me home. -You don't have a car. -Responsible drinker. -Oh. Okay. -[chuckles] -Well, let's go. -Wait, wait, wait. I really wanna make sure that you can drive. -How? -Walk in a straight line. [stammers] Do I really have to do this? Come on! Just do it! Okay. -Here. -Hey! Look at me. -Look at me. -Okay. I'm looking at you. How about that? -What else? -Last one. Mm? Eye test. [chuckling] You're enjoying this, huh? Okay. You can drive me home. [car horn honks] -Did I pass the job interview? -[chuckles] Wait... Sorry. Well, you see... you're handsome and you're such a gentleman. But... I really can't do this. Sorry. That's the reason why we date. To see if it works or not. -Thank you. -It's okay. -Take care. -Thank you. Take care. Bye. [gasps] Babe. Hey, how did it go? Was he nice? [mutters] Yes. Super. Oh. So... How was it? Did you enjoy? Of course. What about you and Archie? Did you achieve anything? [scoffs] Are you sure it was just you and Archie the whole night? Yes, it was just us. Um, tell me what happened. He's more handsome up close. He's such a gentleman. The way he touched me. The way he... Hey... Sorry. Is it too detailed? No, go. He was gentle. First, he kissed my hand... Here... And then my shoulders... Here? He then touched my legs and pulled up my skirt. [Ethan] Like this... [moans] And then he kissed me on the lips... Like this... [pants] [moans] [pants] My god, babe. If we're always like this, maybe we won't have to do this open relationship thing. What if we stop being open? We'll see. I'll tell you a secret. But don't tell anybody. -Especially to our sister. -Is this juicy? Go! Come on! Tell me. -Never mind. -Oh, come on! You already got me excited. -No, never mind. -Tell me! -I don't want! -You're not going to tell me? -No. -Are you sure? Really? -Come on! -Ouch! -Tell me! -Stop! -What's wrong with you? -Out with it already! It's nothing. Okay, fine. [sighs] I lied to Ethan. Listen, we're in an open relationship. Wait, open as in open relationship? -[exhales] -Wow! -Modern couple! -That's the thing. I'm really not for it. I tried to go on a date last night. -Then? -I really couldn't do it. Why did you agree to this, then? Because of Ethan. Come on, Rome! You agreed to that. Either you suck it up or just back out completely. Or make sure that Ethan doesn't do it. Make him realize that he doesn't have to see other people. -[elevator door dings] -Wait, wait! [gasps] Sorry. -[Erika] That was close. -Hey. I heard that the accreditation of our supplier got fast-tracked. Ms. Sanchez was so impressed. You're really good. -You're just feeding my ego. -No. I'm just a proud friend-slash-co-worker. [laughs] Ms. Sanchez wants to see us. ASAP. -You're still here? -[phone ringing] Duty calls. Pick that up. Hello, babe. What time are you coming home? -[Ethan] Ah... -[Erika] Ethan, let's go. Let's have dinner after, okay? Babe, my boss wants to see us. Emergency meeting. -[Ethan] So... -So, what time will you be home? -Um... -[Erika] Ethan, let's go. I don't know, babe, since this is an emergency meeting. -Is Erika with you? -No. Um... -[indistinct chatter] -I don't know. Maybe. [Rome] Maybe? Who was that talking? Isn't that Erika? Babe, I have to go. My boss is calling me. Bye. -[Rome] Wait! -[Erika] Let's go. Are you sure you're not with Erika? I'm sure. Uh, babe, I have to go. Stay safe. Bye. [Erika]Let's go. Damn it! [crowd cheering] -I'll just get a drink. -Huh? -I'll just get a drink. -Okay. Lay off! You okay? -Huh? -You okay? -I'm okay. -I'm Sam. -Huh? -I'm Sam. Oh, Rome. Rome. Mm. Want to go outside? It's too loud here. Yes, it is. Am I boring you with my life story? No. No, of course not. [laughs] Still sober? Drink water. What? Wait. So, no regrets? And you chose career over family? Over your ex? There was no other choice. I just focused on myself. That's amazing. You're amazing. The thought of him kissing someone else sends shivers down my spine. Why does it seem like it's so easy for him? I should've seen this coming. I should've never agreed to this. -[elevator dings] -[Rome] How stupid of me. It's like I gave him the license to cheat. So, would you like some water? Coffee? Can you still go home? Bathroom. [Sam]Why did you agree? I mean, why did you think this setup would work for you? [Rome]I don't know. I could feel him slowly drifting away from me. [sniffles] If I didn't do this, I might lose him completely. [knocking on door] Ethan? You okay? Um, sorry, I'm drunk. [scoffs] [mutters] [chuckles] I can't drive home like this. You can't sleep over. No, not here. In our new condo. Let me guess. There's something wrong between you and Rome. [Sam]That's the problem. People who have been in a long-term relationship. Like you. You didn't get the chance to know yourself on your own. It's like you're just one person. No. Relationships should be like that. It's like you're one. Rome. You're two different people. You should have... your own identity outside your relationship. If not, you lose. Look at you. -That's not water. -Hm? It's okay. Last drink. -Mm... -You really can't go home now. Then I'll sleep here. [hiccups] Ethan, what are you doing? We can go to work together tomorrow. And what will you be wearing? My clothes? Thank you. No worries. I better get going. I'm not that drunk. And I'm not stupid. It's okay. It's not. Trust me. Rome and I... [Ethan]We're in an open relationship. I don't want drama. No drama. Promise. -You alright? -[sniffles] [sighs] [moans] -[chuckles] -Wait... [gasps] Are you okay? [moans] [phone ringing] [Angie] I'm so sorry, Rome. I was so drunk last night. How did you get home? Um, Angie. Um... -Someone took me home.-Who? -Just some guy. -How reserved. Someone doesn't want to share. You okay? Hello? Rome? Are you still there? Rome? Hello? -Hello, Rome. -[sniffles] I'm okay. You sure? If there's anything you need, call me. Yeah. Alright, just keep me posted. I'll go ahead. -Hello? Rome? -[whimpering] Bye. [sighs] -[Rome] Mm? -Hey! -Babe. -Babe! I thought you went home to the condo? No. I met a girl last night. I showered at the motel. Okay. How was it? Was it good? How about you? Okay. Actually, more than okay. -Are you sure you're okay? -Hm-mm. Why do you ask? Nothing. [Rome]I'll think about it, okay? But I'm really excited for this. I think we have a really good idea! -[man] I know, right? -Okay. Thank you so much for your time. [man]See you, Rome. -[clears throat] I'm back! -Ma'am! -Hey, you remember EM? -Of course! Well, she's coming home for a show next week. This is Norman, curator of EM's art show. -Hi! -[Norman] Hello! -This is Rome, our copywriter. -Oh, you sound familiar. Ah, that's right! EM was talking about you. She said that she had a colleague who has a really good taste in art. Yeah. You used to paint, right? That was a long time ago, Ma'am. Oh, come on! Why don't you paint again, Rome? Who knows, Norman might feature you in his gallery. Well, I hope I get the chance. -To see your work. -Of course. Yeah. You eat too fast. Let me do that. -I'll do it. Let me. -Okay. Thank you. Sure. Anything for you. Why are you doing this? I mean, what are you doing? Why? Eating? And keeping you company? What... [mutters] -Ethan. -Yeah? In your open relationship with Rome, have you had sex with anyone else besides me? [chuckles] I'm busy, and... Our setup is still new, also... It's more convenient to be with you. [stammers] Oh, sorry! No offense. -Okay, none taken. -Yeah? But don't you think you should be sleeping with other women? Ethan, you're missing the point of being in an open relationship. -I'm satisfied with you. -I know, right? Why? Do you want me to sleep with other people? Up to you. Just don't compare them to me because you'll be disappointed. -Who are you calling? -Here you go, boys! -Here. -Hey... For the groom. For the best man. They're beautiful. Looks good. Thank you, Madam! Dude, how are things with Rome? Does it work for you guys? I think. [laughs] There! Welcome to the club! By the way, Erika... Is she single? She doesn't text me back. Ethan? What the hell, Ethan! Does Rome know? Dang! Is it only sex? I don't know. Damn you. You're my friend. Excuse me. You're my best friend. My best man even. But I also love Rome. She went through hell for you. Only for you to cheat on her again? Thank her for agreeing on such deal. She seems like she's enjoying herself. It doesn't matter. I can't blame you, Erika's hot. But you're being a jerk, dude. What's your plan? I don't know. I don't know if I should tell her. She'll get hurt. You only thought of that now? -Oh, here's the refill! -I swear! Yes, thank you! -Cheers, cheers, cheers! -Cheers! -Congrats! -Congrats! Cheers! Mm... Hm... I'm glad we got the account. I was so nervous while presenting. But when I saw the accounts manager smile, I knew then, we got the deal. It's ours. [Rome]Thank you, Carla. -Mm? -Thank you. Thanks for giving me the opportunity. -[Rome] The whole team? -Hm? They were so happy! You know Patrick? If you see his new logo designs, they're all good! All of us, they're just all so inspired. You know, you've improved so much. -Hmm? -[Carla] Yeah! You got the term right. Inspired! What changed with you lately? You're blooming. Gosh! Like... You've come out of your shell, you've come out of your box. Whatever it is you're doing, right... That painting... Reconnecting with yourself. Keep it up. Thank you. Thank you. -Oh, cheers! -Cheers! -Enough with the sappiness! -This sounds like a tribute. How touching! [indistinct chattering] -[sighs] -Hey! What happened? Delayed! Deliveries to the province will be delayed for a week. Hm. I knew someone who was delayed for a month. Does he still have a job? Actually, you replaced him. [laughs] Come on, let's have a drink. No, Erika. Come on. Let's go, let's go. -Okay. -Let's go. [laughs] I can imagine what Ms. Sanchez would say. She's menopausal. Maybe I should resign. Before she fires me. Ms. Sanchez... Will you please stop thinking about her? You're ruining the mood. Uh, wait... Can we just talk? I'm not in the mood yet. Then let me set the mood for you. Wait. [sighs] Uh, I just want to vent. Is that okay? Okay. Go ahead. Okay. Um... I need to tell you something. I don't know if it's obvious or if you've noticed but... But I'm so insecure with my position in the office now. It's like all eyes are on me. It's like everyone is telling me I'm not doing the right thing. -Especially Ms. Sanchez! -Ethan! It's only Ms. Sanchez. It goes in one ear and out the other. Easy for you to say. You're good at your job. I know! Cheers to me! Yay! [snickers] [sighs] What's wrong? Nothing. Something just crossed my mind. Uh. I'm sorry. It's okay. Rome... Babe. -What time did you get home? -Late. [sighs] Let me join. Later. I haven't won yet. Please. [groans] Move. -Go, move a bit. Watch out! -Ouch! Babe. Hm. Can we stop this open setup? Cause I miss you. Hm? I don't want to share you anymore. I want you to be mine alone. Is that okay? Of course. ETHAN: I HAVE A SURPRISE FOR YOU. -[sighs]-[Rome] Wow! -Let's eat. [laughs] -Thank you. Actually, babe, we have to finish this before the strawberries get spoiled. Okay. Oops... [grunts] Thank you. -Hmm... -[phone rings] Sorry, sorry. -Hello? -[woman] Rome... In five minutes, meeting room. Mm? Okay, okay. Babe, sorry I have to go now. -What? -Thank you so much. Bring the cake with you. -Share it with Carla. -No need. No, it's okay. You can take it to your office. -Bye. -Okay, bye. [chuckles] Rome, I still remember when you'd scold me because I used to sell prints of my works. Oh, that's right. You did tell me to find a curator, right? [Rome]What's Norman doing here? Oh, no, Rome, Norman won't leave you alone again. -Hi, Norman! -Hello! Hi! [chuckles] EM, I think your family's looking -to take pictures with you. -[EM] Oh? -Excuse me. -[both] Bye. -Hi. -Um... Looks like we have some unfinished business. [snickers] [phone rings] Hello, Norman? Oh, what's up? How are you? [Norman] I'm good. And I also have good news for you. I saw your work and I showed it to my other curator friends. And we all think that we can sell your work. -Really? -Yeah, I'm not joking. -Wow! -It's really, really good. -[sighs]-Uh, I'm serious. -[Norman] Not only that... -[chuckles] -Oh? -I have an interested buyer. -I'm game. -Are you game? I'm so game! -Thank you!-It's all you. -I'm just a middleman. -No. I still owe you. Just let me know whatever help you need to make this happen. Yeah. By the way, we have potential buyers in Europe. You'll send my paintings to Europe? Yes, we do. Okay... Okay, okay. It's a long shot but... -I'll try. -We can make it happen. -Gosh, thanks so much. -Okay, bye. Yes! [chuckles] Oh, wait. I'm almost done cooking. Babe, your painting is beautiful. Oh? Is it for our condo? Oh, you're right. Possibly. But the curator... You remember EM? EM? EM knows a curator who's interested in my works. He wants to see if he can sell them. I really hope so. Right, babe? [snickers] [groans] [utensils clank] Mm? Babe... Let's get married? Sorry, I don't have a ring. But I can't delay this proposal anymore. Rome... I want to be with you. Just you. For the rest of my life. We grew together, and I want to keep growing until we're old. Romina Jimenez... Will you marry me? [sniffling] I've waited so long for this to happen. But now, I don't know how to answer. Please say yes. Please.

What's wrong with you and Ethan? Did you guys have a fight? Did you? -Has he told you... -I told him... Love... Sorry. Just talk to Ethan. He's not even planning to tell her. Wait, wait. What is it? -It's about Erika. -Love! [Archie]Sorry, Rome. Ethan! [pants] Give me the keys. -I said give me the keys! -Rome, wait. Damn you, just give me the keys! Rome! Rome, wait, Rome! Rome, please wait. How many times? Rome... How many times did you have sex with Erika? -I don't know. -Huh? Thrice. Or more. Is that why you wanted an open relationship? So you can legitimately have sex with her? Rome, no. Then why? I've had my suspicions about your affair with Erika. But we're open, right? Knowing how horny you are, why only sleep with Erika? I'm sorry. -Rome, let's talk. -Let go! If Erika's not the reason, then why did you force me into an open relationship? Wasn't it for us? To save our relationship. Right?! That's why I agreed. I agreed to an open relationship because I thought it was the only way for you to stay. Rome... Did you know I felt so guilty? I felt guilty because I thought... I thought I couldn't satisfy you anymore. So, fine. Open? Okay, open! Free-for-all, fine! Free-for-all. Damn! Damn it! Damn it all! Damn you! [grunts] [sighs] What?! Rome, I'm sorry. [crying] Why? Why? Why? Why Erika? Why her? Am I not enough? It's me. I'm the one who's not enough, Rome. I know I made a mistake. I was wrong. Don't follow me. -Don't follow me. -Rome. [car door opens] -[car door closes] -Rome... [door closes] -[saleslady] Hi, good afternoon! -[Archie] Good afternoon! [Archie] Uh, Miss, for pickup. Wedding bands. -[saleslady] Okay. -[Archie] Thank you! [Ethan] Are you doing this on purpose? Taking me here. -Have you forgiven me? -I was never mad at you. I just didn't like the decisions you made in your life. You might suddenly propose to her. I already proposed. But with no ring. It was before we had that fight. What if I propose again? Maybe if I have a ring this time... She'll talk to me. [sniffles] Idiot! That's not a solution. Ethan, I'm sorry. I guess there's a reason why a lot of couples don't do it. At the end of the day, being loyal to your partner is more comforting. And knowing you're the only ones in the relationship. Hey... [sniffles] [door opens] [door closes] [Ethan] I thought you won't be here till later? [sighs] My meeting ended early. Did you also leave work early? Ah, I didn't go to work. I went to the grocery. I wanted to cook for you. No need, I'll leave after this. I'll just get my things. I don't know what you want from here, but pick whatever you want. Look, we were so young. [Rome] It was our monthsary, remember? [chuckles] I accepted the job offer in Singapore. Is this really happening? Are we really over? Yes. This is it. Fourteen years, Ethan. We were together for 14 years. Congratulations to us. Rome... Rome, please. I don't want to lose you. I can't imagine my life without you. Why did you hurt me? Twice. Rome. Rome, I can do better. [sobbing] I promise you I will do better. I know. I know, that's why I gave you another chance. Because I believe you can change. [sniffles] Rome. Whoever you'll fall in love with next is very lucky. Rome... Don't you want to try again? We already tried, didn't we? That's why we had an open relationship. I tried. Ethan, you know me. Never in my life did I ever think I can be in an open relationship. You know that. You just don't know on the days that we were doing this, I was losing my mind. I was going crazy thinking about where you were. Who you were with. What you were doing. How far can you go with someone else? God. While I was with the other guys... it felt so weird. You can't understand what I felt. Like I was disgusted with myself. Because I've never had any other man in my life but you. That's why I didn't know how it was to be with other men. God... [sighs] I loved you that much. I loved you so much. My world revolved around you. So I hope... I hope you understand why we can't be together anymore. Why I have to leave. Hmm? I want to try living for myself. Rome, I'm sorry. You too, Ethan. Start living your life on your own. I'm sorry. Enough. This is enough. Rome. Rome. Rome.
