Mom! Mom! Mom! Father Garai, are you OK? Hello...? I'm counting on you, Father Bangkok, Thailand Out of the way! Move! (Thai) Subject has reached the payphone. (Thai) Everybody is in position. (Thai) This is an order from the Captain. (Thai) The hostage is a Japanese tourist, a valued benefactor. (Thai) Rescuing the hostage is a priority. They don't seem to need us here... Something's strange. The abductor contacted the employer of the hostage's father. He knew that the company budget profile has an allowance allocated to offshore crisises. Not the work of an amateur. But he could have made it easier. He could get the money through a Swiss bank. Presto! You think he has other motives? Damn, it's so hot in here. (Thai) Someone is calling the payphone. A call! This is Okazaki. Remove the wire and put it on the phone. Where's my daughter? Is she safe? Just take it off and go to Central World Mall. No, I have to know if she's safe first. Go up to the rooftop and find a phone. What about my daughter? You have 5 minutes. 1 second late and she's gone. Wait a minute! (Thai) Could you trace it? (Thai) It's underway. (Thai) I got it. (Thai) Location? (Thai) He's in Tokyo. That's impossible. (Thai) Subject on his way to the elevators. (Thai) Secure the elevator and vicinity. (Thai) Arrest anyone who is suspicious. Hello? Good. You made it. Take out the hat from the bag. Put it on. What about my daughter? Where is the money? Here, 100 million yen as instructed. Show me one of the bundles. To the top floor of Alexander Hotel in 15 minutes. Now you have work to do in the elevator. (Thai) Okazaki to the elevator. He has a hat. (Thai) Secure the elevator hall. (Thai) The elevator is almost at the ground floor. (Thai) Okazaki's in it. (Thai) Catch them! (Thai) What the...? (Thai) Retrieve the money bag! (Thai) The money's gone. (Thai) Where's Okazaki? Lieutenant Sawaki, we don't have Lt. Sawaki! Report the license plate number! (Thai) Requesting a pursuit on a taxi, license plate number TR2324. (Thai) Okazaki is in the cab. (Thai) I'll go check on the situation up there. (Thai) Roger. What did he say? He's checking things out. Wong! Hey, Wong! Drop the bag in the laundry chute. The laundry chute? (Thai) To the laundry, now. (Thai) Wait for the Squad to arrive. Standby. (Thai) A-Team to the laundry, the others come with me. (Thai) Freeze! (Thai) It's not money, it's newspaper. (Thai) Where's the money? (Thai) Seal off the hotel! (Thai) Excuse me. (Thai) Sir. (Thai) Your briefcase... Tachibana, it's him! (Thai) You asshole...! (Thai) Can you take this too? (Thai) No problem. Damn it! Anybody here? I'm Okazaki! Aiko...? I'm here! I'm here alone as instructed. Where's my girl? Where is she? Where's my daughter? Aiko! What a dramatic reunion. What's going on, Aiko? He and I are going to live together. Have you lost your mind? Dad, thanks for the 100 million. This is not funny! What you're doing is unforgivable! Huh? Who would be forgiving who? Hey, put that away. Don't worry, I won't shoot your father. Aiko! How could you...? How could you be so cruel? I wasn't sure. What...? To kill you before your daughter's eyes... Or to kill the daughter before your eyes. You, devil... Which would be more fun? I think I made the best choice. Michio Yuki from L.A. Millennium Bank. Here are the serial numbers of the ransom money. Thank you. The 100 million ransom was ready in just 2 days... That's unusually fast. Takebishi Construction is a major client. The abductor took the money and killed Mr. Okazaki and his daughter. Why would he do that? Maybe they knew each other? An abduction and murder conviction usually means the death penalty. Do you think it was worth the risk? Maybe it was a grudge? Maybe the abductor really just wanted to kill Okazaki... I can't help you. I'm just a bank employee. My apologies. I'm Lt. Sawaki from Tokyo Metro Police. If anything occurs to you give me a call. Good morning. Kyoko, go see the Editor. The story on the Okazaki case was dropped. Mita's taking over. ...a newspaper must be aware of its place in the market. It's probably not appropriate to suggest that the victim of a kidnap/murder case was involved in corporate fraud. Not without verification. My information comes from a reliable source. From a fired ex-employee? That's unfair. In Japan we value a man's job title. That's enough. We're replacing her article with Mita's. But, Editor! Calm down, Kyoko. Mita has made a good argument today. Readers sympathize with the victim so we can't denounce him. We'll go with Mita, OK? Are you OK? This isn't a random kidnap case! We have to reveal the scandalous truth... That's not the point. Mita's just better at manipulating the decision makers. This isn't about antagonizing the readers! We're journalists! But you were taken off the assignment... I'm not quitting. There it is! Last month's dismemberment murder case. I can write about this, can't I? What's this about? There are other approaches to the kidnapping case. "Search Okino-Mafune Island." "The dismembered body ID'ed." This victim and Okazaki are from the same hometown. That doesn't mean anything. It does when the population of the island is 600. "Okino-Mafune Island left deserted." That was 16 years ago. Put your trust in the Lord Jesus and confess your sins. Help me Lord for I have sinned. I suspect that I took part in a heinous crime. How can I rid myself of this feeling of guilt? My best friend is a criminal. I only learned of his crime later from the newspaper. -Yuki, stop. - It was a shock. I couldn't turn him down. Because the criminal once saved my life. Yuki. Thanks, Garai. You helped me elude the authorities. You killed him... I had no choice. Okazaki recognized who I was. Don't come here. Have you forgotten... the hell we went through to survive? You have to protect someone. Mind your own business. How Mika has grown! She's a woman now. - Don't! -Am I being indecent? It's only the beginning. There's no stopping us. Am I right? Uncle Yuki! Is anything wrong, Father Garai? You look pale. Good morning. Today's schedule. Thank you. Cancel all appointments after 6. Right. OK, I'll stay on the line. Building a relationship of mutual respect with America is what our nation wants and I'll achieve it. Is it true that the ruling party will resign? Will you run for Prime Minister? Spare me your speculations. This is Mochizuki. No development on the Okazaki case, sir. So I heard. There's nothing to worry about. Being paranoid won't help a bit. Relax, I can get all the relevant information. Yes, sir. By the way, about my granddaughter... I'll see to it that she's treated well. Have a word with Matsuo. He has something to tell you. This is Matsuo. 100 million by the end of the month? We need it for the general election. I don't know if we can get that amount so quickly... Okazaki's death left a place on Mr. Mochizuki's campaign board. I can refer you for the post if you help us. May I come in? Certainly, Yuki. Director, were you just speaking with Mr. Mochizuki? You're clued-in, aren't you? You know everything. He's demanding, isn't he? Okazaki had a secret account. He channeled money through sub-contractors. My God...! Over 1 00 million yen of illegal transactions. Oh, no... Or we can eliminate the document. You could use this money to help out Mr. Mochizuki. No... This is illegally acquired money. It would allow you to do a tremendous favor for Mr. Mochizuki. A promotion for you would give me security too. Right... Nothing gets by you, does it? Give me your account details. I'll transfer the money. Let me know if you hear anything about the case. Kyoko, those two men did have something in common. What is it? They were Mochizuki's campaigners. The Minister? The victim of the dismemberment got a big promotion 16 years ago. That's about the same time that Okazaki was head-hunted by a government contractor. And they both come from Okino-Mafune Island. They had jobs they weren't qualified for. They both belonged to the campaign group. Anything on the island? Many residents deserted the island 16 years ago and... And...? There's an undisclosed scandal. What kind of scandal? I don't know, a newspaper began a series on it but then it was cancelled. "Article by Noriaki Kawamura" Mr. Yamamoto, how are you? What can a writer from a rival paper do for you? It's about Noriaki Kawamura. Kawamura? He died after he wrote a story on an island. Oh, the investigative journalist. He was very good at it. Was it a traffic accident? Yes, on the freeway. It was an accident? What are you implying? Didn't anybody take over his assignment? I thought he was on to some big scandal. It was a long time ago. It has something to do with Minister Mochizuki, doesn't it? Better stay out of it, Kyoko. That was quite a story, sir. Well, anyway... Look after my granddaughter for me. Kanako, you must do your best too. -I won't let you down. - Welcome to our team. Mr. Mochizuki, I appreciate your precious time. Yuki here will be the one handling matters. You needn't worry about him. He's my right-hand man. And enormously smart. I'm sure you'll find him very reliable. Yuki. We have a disposable sum of 100 million right here. How do you intend to use that money, young man? As a contribution towards the running of this country. Sometimes the worthy rules of politics must be bent a little. Only a man of your faculties can utilize this money. I appreciate your faith in Mr. Mochizuki. As you said, politics can be complicated. It's good to know that some people understand my difficult position. Mr. Yuki. What a coincidence! Are you on duty? No, I'm here for my monthly meeting with my daughter. Really. She's sarcastic with me and I try not to offend her. I don't know what it's worth. Sounds bad. You remember Aiko Okazaki, The autopsy revealed substance abuse. Before she left for Bangkok she went to her regular club and told everybody that she'd be rich. You mean, it was staged? Yes, and she had a male accomplice. So he helped her? I think he was the mastermind. Is that a cop's hunch? Just a hunch, but I have a word of advice for you. It's not cool to bring along your partner when you meet your daughter. Did he talk? He's tougher than I figured. You look bothered recently... The children feels sad when you're down... I also... I'll take it. - I can answer it. - It's OK. Hello. Is this Yuki? Are you having a seizure? Where are you, Yuki? Do you often have seizures? Yes... How about you, Garai? I don't have any... Sorry, Yuki. I'm running out of time. Listen, Yuki. Will I ever be able to sleep without having nightmares? Sure you will. After I punish them all... No, I don't want that. None of it... Spare me your preach, Father. All I want is you beside me. No more terrible crimes. I'll abduct Yamashita tomorrow. What for...? I know that... you will never betray me. Tachibana? A call on the Okazaki case. - I'll take it. - OK. Hello, this is Sergeant Tachibana. There is something I want to tell you directly. My number is 090...34 Let me off, sir. Are you still pushing drugs? Omori. Pull yourself together! I'm sorry! Do you recognize this girl? I sold to her a few times. Who was she with? She brought a man once. Describe him. How am I supposed to remember... Can't you throw in some for free? Give me a break. Come on! Hello. That one's a PUL. It'll go PB in no time. Collect it immediately. It was some kind of jargon. Like cop lingo, you know? It's me. It's Potential Uncollectible Loan and Possible Bankruptcy. Bank lingo. I see. That's good, hot shot. I'm following up something on the Okazaki case. Buy me dinner if I get a lead. What? I've got another call, later. Wait... Oh, it's you. You want to meet me earlier? No problem. What's going on? Whoops, you killed him. I rigged the gag so that his artery would be cut when you undid it. Yuki! How does it feel to kill a man? You traitor. I can give this to the police. Do as you like. Think about the worst scenario. You'd be jailed and I'd be free. You know I won't be caught so easily. I don't have much time left. Don't worry. I won't kill anymore if you promise to help me. Where's Tachibana? He stepped out a while ago. Good morning. I won't be in today. Just do your research. No problem. You sound high-spirited. Can you tell? I'm onto something. Good morning, sir. Care for a ride? Yes, thank you. You changed your name and residency information when you got married. Why did you want to erase your past, sir? Yuki... What are you...? What do you think you're doing? It's time to redeem yourself. You have plenty of time to think. Yuki. I respect your husband, Mrs. Kawamura. He revealed many corporate scandals and saved many people from becoming victims. Thank you for saying so. He said it was all for social justice but all we got in return was a miserable life. This was his room. Feel free to look around. Did he die in a traffic accident? Yes. On that day he was excited about this big scoop he had. Next thing you know... I guess he was ill-fated. What was the scoop? I have absolutely no idea. Take your time. "Okino-Mafune Island" "Completely Deserted" Excuse me. Have you heard from Yamashita? No. Any suggestions? We should act quickly. The press will know in no time. They'll think we're hiding something if we don't make some statements. I know you're anxious but we need your help. Certainly. "Fraud case at L.A. Millennium Bank" "Suspect - Takashi Yamashita." Yamashita? Same guy. "Takashi Yamashita" This is late breaking news. A fraud involving 100 million yen was uncovered at L.A. Millennium Bank. The man allegedly responsible, Takashi Yamashita, is a director The police report says that Yamashita used the on-line system to pilfer 100 million yen from clients' accounts. The suspect is at large and a search is underway. Yuki! Where is he? L.A. Millennium Bank is having an emergency Board meeting... Mr. Yuki. I'm with L.A. Millennium Bank. It's not cool to bring along your partner when you meet your daughter. This is Sawaki. I need to get a hold of a list of callers who called us at around 9pm last night. We realize the gravity and the impact of this situation. We'd like to express our deepest concerns. And also offer our apology. Yuki! Did you enjoy the news? So, you were framing me all along. This is nothing compared to the hell you forced on us. What have I done to you? Is it called MW? That was the name of the nerve gas. 16 years ago... The US military facility was developing MW. A leak at the plant killed your whole family. But you helped Mochizuki cover up the incident. You saw death inflicted on your family. Didn't you feel any remorse? You're just Mochizuki's pet. We had no other choice. If we hadn't complied, we would have been killed. Director Yamashita. Where is the MW hidden now? Come on... I don't know anything. Where is the MW hidden? I don't know. I was sworn to secrecy but I really don't know anything! Was the MW taken off the island? I really don't know anything. I'll tell you a secret. I killed Okazaki and his daughter. And the dismemberment murder, Wait a minute... Wait! Help me, please. Don't kill me! It's on the island. The MW is still on the island. Nice try. It's true! It was dangerous to transport it. It's hidden in a safe place there... Where on the island? I don't know anything else! "Intruder" It's me. I'm at the home of the Okazaki killer suspect. Repeating. I'm at the home of the Okazaki killer suspect. Hi, can I speak with you? Yes... Who are you? My name's Kyoko Makino, Central Newspaper. The suspect's apartment has been found. Has he been arrested? He should be arrested soon. Contact the commanding officer. Lt. Sawaki. The tenant is Ichiro Yamazaki, aged 45. No fingerprints. There are no prints in this apartment. Lt. Sawaki. I found out that Yamazaki has been dead for 8 years. Another corpse. He sounds like a nice man. Yes, Father Garai is very dependable. You're back, Father. Hello, I'm Makino. Can you come back tomorrow? It's quite late. It won't take long. Just a few questions about the late Father Murakoshi. It's really quite late... I know about it. About what? About MW. I'll excuse myself, Father. Good night. I know about you two. I want to help you. What will you help us with? You must be Mr. Yuki. What if I am? Did you know Araki and Okazaki? They were both murdered. You two are in danger too. In danger? People from your island are being killed off. I want to protect you. What's this about? I want you to testify about what you saw on the island. What will happen if we did? Mochizuki will be impeached. With no proof? What if I have proof? What do you know? I know where the MW is. It still exists? Yes, it does. Father Murakoshi contacted Kawamura, the journalist and Kawamura learned about MW. It was the deadliest chemical warfare in history developed around the time of the Gulf War. It's hard to imagine that a nerve gas deadlier than sarin was developed in Japan. The accident on your island 16 years ago was caused by a small portion of MW when it leaked from the plant there. Most of the islanders died instantaneously. Survivors were massacred. Those who'd already left the island were sworn to secrecy by the government who gave them powerful jobs if they complied. It happened 16 years ago and the man behind the cover-up... It was Mochizuki, who was the Deputy Foreign Minister. The cover-up seemed successful. But there were two boys who survived. They escaped to the mainland. The names of the boys were Michio Yuki and Yutaro Garai. Yuki has been on an overseas business trip for 2 days. Did you confirm his departure? Not yet. I only listen to confirmed facts! Where is Michio Yuki? Are you OK, Yuki? Don't touch me... Where is the MW? What's wrong? Were you misinformed? If it's on the island, where's Did you know that water can neutralize MW? It's in the reservoir. Lt. Sawaki, Minister Mochizuki's Hello. I'm Sawaki, We've been following the Okazaki murder case. Right. It seems your partner had a promising future. Yes. What conclusion do you draw on events? I see. This could become a national emergency. We have to stop him. We'll cooperate. Will you really report this? Definitely. There's nothing to be afraid of now. We'll have MW and the Kawamura memo. A memo? Mr. Kawamura's research memo. That's your lead? He protected this memo with his life. I recommend that you don't mention this to Yuki. Why shouldn't l? Because... I found it! Garai. Give me the wire cutters, now! What we saw 16 years ago was horrible. Those who had died after inhaling MW and the survivors who were shot. Without Yuki, I would have died. But on account of helping me... he accidentally inhaled MW. He survived but not without side effects. The gas changed him completely. Changed him how? It's like... Yuki isn't a human anymore. What do you mean? He's not a victim of Government threats. He is the threat to the nation. What? You're in danger too. Is it that important? Kawamura's research memo, Keep calm. Give it to me. The chopper pilots only saw you and Garai. I can escape. There's no time to waste. "Sample portion of MW" "US Tokyo Base" I didn't know that Kawamura left this behind. I guess he was some journalist. You didn't... Yes, I disabled his car. Father Murakoshi wasn't afraid of the Government. It was me. Hello, Mika. Are you going on the Goodwill visit to the US base? Good, I'll talk to you later. What are you up to? So you're up, are you? Leave Mika out of this. I could use her help. Haven't you done enough? Let's just run away together. If there's some MW at US Tokyo Base, I want it. Haven't you had enough? Enough lives have been taken. I told you to spare me your preaching. I don't want revenge. Would you kill me too? Come with me... Die with me. I dropped my favorite toy... Hi, kids. I'm handing the subject over to the Tokyo Metro Police. Oh, God... So Michio Yuki has reached the heart of all secrets. Matsuo. Yuki has found a way into the US Tokyo Base. Contact Sawaki. Yes, Minister. He's there to steal the nerve gas that does not exist. Yuki's already in the Base and has taken hostages. This is classified so contain the situation discreetly. Talk to Yutaro Garai. He's well-informed about the case. He'll help you catch Yuki. So it was all an elaborate plot by Yuki. That's right. I failed to stop him. You know what Yuki says he wants? He's demanding that the Government admits to the MW cover-up. Is that what he really wants? No, I don't think that's it. Why, what is it? Is it because he's a monster? You're trigger happy, officer. Are you going to fire in public again? Sure, like I did in Thailand. What do you want, Yuki? Shoot if you want to. And then you'd be responsible for history's deadliest gas attack. OK, children, run! Are you OK? I thought I lost you, partner. Let's end this. Everybody will know about MW. That should be enough. What more do you want? I want the world to come to an end. I won't live much longer. I figure that the whole world can end with me. Isn't it fantastic? Don't you understand this? I can never quench this thirst... no matter how many I kill. You want the world to end? Yes. You don't have enough MW to do that. You can't escape anymore. You want to crash dive into Tokyo? That sounds intriguing too. What are you thinking? I'll sell MW to anybody who wants it. To others who want the world to end. You can't escape... .Japan's under my control. They'll listen to the terrorists. I bet I'd be welcome in many countries. What are you going to do? Water neutralizes MW. I'll drop it in the sea. Then I'll have this plane shot down. It's over. And how will you let them know? I can redeem both of us now, Yuki. An expose on the MW-related events by Kyoko Makino, appeared in Central Newspaper. Both the US and Japanese governments are denying responsibility. The police covered up all Michio Yuki's crimes. "Scandal Revealed by Journalist" Minister Mochizuki, the only man who knows the truth, remained silent about the incident. Soon people forgot about the terror of the MW scandal. "US Embassy Fire, Terrorists Responsible? " "Mochizuki to be appointed Prime Minister" Hello? Did you read the papers? Fun is expected at Mochizuki's inauguration. "Prime Minister Yasuo Mochizuki" Having been appointed by the both houses of the Diet I hereby assume the duty as Prime Minister of this country. Guided by the public demands... That was a rehearsal. A statement. I can always kill him. I have a word of advice for you, Lt. Sawaki. It's better to shave before you meet your daughter. Hey! Hello?
