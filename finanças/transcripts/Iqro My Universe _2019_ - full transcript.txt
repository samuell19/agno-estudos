As an astronomer, Opa has spent more than half of his life to observe sky objects. As Opa said, because this universe is vast Human lifespan is not enough to uncover its mystery When Opa said that, I just got more curious. Is it possible that one day human will be able live on another planet? Scientists predict natural resources will run out For the survival of mankind, we must find another planet to live I wonder where we'll be heading? To answer the question, I have to be an astronaut! Please explain the experiment! / Our group has created a robot to be sent to Mars So, our group has created the leg robot made of sikat on purpose, Sir. So it will support its ability to walk on any circumstances, like uneven terrain On the top of this robot, we have put a camera. And we can see the image from here. Please explain the experiment! / We created a solar panel to power houses, Sir! Can you elaborate more on the strong points of this solar panel? This panel serves to convert sun's energy into electricity The components are charge controler, inventer, and battery to store the energy that has been produced The good thing about it is that it is renewable energy The maintenance of it is also quite simple Very good. Good! How is it going, Wibowo? You have been expected here. / Alright, see you Opa, Om../ Aqila, hold on a second/ okay For this part, I've orded the component from Germany / Yes / Please accept the order/ Alright, Prof. And message to the tech nician, please be careful during the installation / Noted, Prof. Don't forget, alright?/ Noted, Prof Professor! / Yes? Best of luck! / Thank you How was the experiment today? / It went well Even though there was a little a problem. The point is I didn't win Who won?/ June, the new girl. She is smart, just moved from abroad …she made mini solar panel to power toy house. / Cool.. Eh.., but I think winning or losing doesn't matter What matters is that you keep trying Robot made of sikat is cool. Who knows when you grow up, you could invent a robot to Mars for real Eh, tby the way, your mom is not looking for you? You're in my office everyday. Of course not. She knows I'm here. And it's also close from home. My goodness… little kid, don't throw the food. Come on, eat your food now. Go on! Assalammualaikum / Waalaikummussalam, How was the competition? Kak Aqila Honestly, it's hard for me to leave, Ma / Why is that? Is it okay for you? / You don't need to worry Aside from having some saving, I have retirement fund. In case something happens to me. Don't worry. Just focus. I'm always rooting for you. Join vlog competition about Indonesian space figure Win the prize to visit space training center in the UK from Aqila Assalammualaikum / Waalaikummussalam, Aqila What's going on, honey? / Opa, do you know I just got an info from LAPAN (National Institute of Aeronautics and Space) They're having vlog competition, Opa / Yes?/ the prize is I could come to astronaut training center but this vlog must be about space figure. Will you help me to make this vlog? Aqila, there was something I wanted to tell you but I don't know how to say it So, here's the thing tomorrow I will go someplace away and I'll be back in a while Because there's a good friend of mine who asked me to do a research there So, eh, hello.. Hello she hung up the phone Qila, let's have dinner Qila, what's going on?/ why did nobody tell me that Opa is leaving? We didn't mean to hide it from you / I have no one else to talk about space! You have me Hi Qila Hi/ You know about that competition, right? I know you're making a vlog about your grandpa, aren't you? Why? Didn't you say your grandpa is an astronomer? Yes and he just moved to the UK. Working for an observatory in UK. Ooh... Wanna know my plan? Over this weekend, my family is going on vacation. We're going to Siak The plan is I'm coming over to visit an astronaut candidate's house Astronaut?/ You know, only few people from Indonesia became an astronaut.

Like a TV show, but it's on the internet Oh, so for this vlog competition, you have to create a content about space figure? now why don't you try to find another space figure in Indonesia? How? space figure? Oh Papa, you're a lawyer, right / Yes / You have a lot of friends, right? Is there any of your friend who is an astronaut? Temen Papa yang astronaut? I don't think so, Qila.

Wb / Waalaikummussalam / Thank you for your attendance. Especially to my teacher who has made Indonesia proud. "Through this book, I'd like to express my gratitude to be a part of the world that conducts research on growing food in outer space" If this experiment is working well, it could be an initial step for mankind to explore outer space in further Sebetulnya apa sudah ada tanaman yang berhasil hidup di luar angkasa? / When I was in space station, I was observing plants like algae which had survived for 16 months Diharapkan nanti ada jenis tanaman lain yang bertahan dan akan jadi sumber makanan untuk manusia Tika, Aqila is not home yet? / Is that so? Where is she?/ She said good-bye for school. Let me call Pak Tebe, her driver Where would she be? Hello, Ma'am. I'm Aqila. Would you like to be in my vlog? So, in my my vlog I have to find a figure in space. / Aqila with a Q, isn't it? / Yes. Can you cut to the chase? / Ma'am, say yes please? I really want to be an astronaut! It's vlog competition, Ma'am If I win, I could go to astronaut training center. / Thank you/ Yes Ma'am… Ma'am, I really want to be an astronaut/ With who… / Husein.. Plant research center with address: Jl Gaharu III No. 15, South Jakarta Assalammu'alaikum Kak / Waalaikummussalam.. / Kak, can I meet Mrs. Tsurayya? What is it about? / I have an assignment/ What assignment/ Assignment.. To make a flog about Mrs. Tsurayya Come, follow me!

Can I? / Ok, but not too long/ Ok, thank you Assalammualaikum Bu. / Waalaikummussalam I hope you'd be willing to join my vlog / Why do you really want me to be in your vlog? That's because I want to be an astronaut Ma'am I really want to be an astronaut Ma'am Why do you want to be an astronaut? / Because my grandpa is an astronomer, he often took me to visit an observatory to observe stars I'm thinking if one day I can be an astronaut, I'll be able to see outer space without a telescope If I didn't want to be in your vlog, or if you didn't win this competition, would you still want to be an stronaut? Aku tetap mau jadi astronot dengan cara apapun Bu. Tapi, hadiah kompetisi ini buat aku penting karena kalau aku menang, aku bisa datang ke tempat pelatihan astronot.. Yes, please ma'am. I really wanna go there. Here's the deal. I can help you but you need to pass some tests from me. If you pass, I can help you with your vlog. Are you up for it? / Yes, ma'am! So, who's picking up Fauzi? Should I? No needs. InsyaAllah Fauzi's father, Bang Codet, will drive him here Yes, that's good if somebody is picking his up / If possible, please come home by Ashar's time. Have the prayer hera at home, so you'll be able to brief Fauzi I'll try my best to break the fast at home. I'm off now. Assalamualaikum / Waalaikummussalam. So, how ma'am? Do you want to be in my vlog? Don't get too excited now. You want to go to spacecraft, right? Do you know jobs in the spacecraft like NASA? Send satellite, then conduct some research like you do, right? Space farming? Actually a lot of research carried out in space is for the benefit of human life on earth For instance in 1989, NASA conducted a research on clean air at home There are 2 types of plants that are best for filtering the air. Well, one of those plants is good for health. If you can bring that plant here, I'll help you. / What's the name of the plant, Ma'am? It's Ashar's time already Hi Boss / Hi Codet, if you meet Pikun later, you must ask him for a few times where to deliver because he is forgetful. / Yes, boss! If it's wrong, he'll take you to go on round and round I have to tell you, if it is not for a relative, I wouldn't have made him my assistant. Cause he is very forgetful. Alright, boss. I'll remind Pikun. One more thing, I'm returning favor to his father. Cause, his father was very nice to me Why am I sharing this to you? You understand, Codet? Yes. Fauzi, later at night I'll pick you up at Sis Raudha's, okay? I'm still busy with work. / Yes, dad Don't make any trouble, don't be naughty. You often do that. / Yes, sir Ok, let's go / Ok Kak Raudhah was your Qur'an teacher from Lembang, don't let her down Assalamualaikum, assalamualaikum.. Waalaikummussalam.. Alhamdulillah you're here. Why are you here alone? Where if your father? I was dropped at the front, Sis. Cause my dad was in hurry. / Oh, he is occupied, isn't he?! Mas...! Sis, here you go. / What is it? / It's a gift from Mak for Kak Raudhah Masyaa Allah, so beautiful / Alhamdulillah you're here. Why don't you come inside? Fauzi brought so beaitufl flowers for me, now I miss Lembang / Come on in Sis, do you have Chrysant? Nope, sorry / Thank you Brother, do you have Chrysant? / Nope, try from the next store. Maybe they have.. Brother, do you have a flower like this? / Nope, we don't have like that / Ok then, thank you.. This is the form. Fill out everything, except the registration number, it's filled by the officer there. Stationary is also provided. Are you staying in Jakarta or going back to Lembang afterwards? I'm planning to stay here cause my dad just rented a place here. Because he just got a new job. Alhamdulillah then. Cause next week, that Pesantren (Boarding School) is having an entrance test. So, if you stay here you can prepare first. Especially for the recitation, Zi. It's very important. InsyaAllah, Sis / Alright, don't worry too much. Return all to Allah. Focus on practicing.. If you get the scholarship, it is full covered. From the living cost to the tuition. So your father will be more at ease, right? Thank you, Sis / Oh yes, cause you're here in Jakarta, I also have invited Aqilla to break the fast here with us Come on, Fauzi, eat a lot. Have more, ok? / No needs, already full. Assalammualaikum / Waalaikummussalam / Eh, you came. Thought you weren't coming! How are you, good? Sis, this is Chrysant right? / Yes, it's Chrysant. Why? Did you plan this? / Mak (Fauzi's Grandma) did. Fauzi brought this for Kak Raudhah Can I borrow this? / What for, Qila? Don't. It'll be ruined. / Please, I'll return later... it's very important Okay Qila, you can take it. But don't forget its inhabitant. / Inhabitant? What inhabitant? Gotcha! My goodness, masa sama kumbang aja takut. / I'm not scared, just shocked! cuma kaget! what a prankster! So, what's the story? Why are you suddenly into plants? So here's the thing, actually I'm competing in vlog competition, Sis. Then? / The vlog is about space figure and the prize is I'll be able to visit astronaut's training center. You know I always wanted to be an astronaut, right? / Yes, I know.. Do you know who I'll be collaborating with? / Grandpa Wibowo, right? Grandpa is in the UK, sis. He's got a research there. Oh really.. Didn't know that. So how's your vlog? Luckily you sent me that book. Didn't expect an Indonesian to have studied about plants that long, especially to space The book is good, isn't it?/ So, I want her in my blog, Mrs. Tsurayya Does she want? Not yet, actually. She doesn't want if I'm ony aiming for the prize. She wants me to learn... You always want to win anyways, that's what you have in mind! / Hush, Fauzi So, what's next, Qila? Just knew she's firm. Maybe because she's been through astronaut's selection So she takes you seriously. / So it's hard to go to space right... Indeed it is, but if it's Allah's will, who could defy? Now let me ask you, who's the first astronaut? / Yuri Gagarin? Prophet Muhammad. During Isra Mi'raj (the Night Journey and Ascensio. That's when the command to pray five times was set. Prophet Muhammad went through the 7th heaven. / Wow, how did he do that? At that time Prophet Muhammad was assisted by the angel Gabriel. That event was a special miracle of God given to Prophet Muhammad. About space trip, your Grandpa has mentioned during his lecture In Surah Ar Rahman, Allah says that humans will not be able to go through the corners of heaven and earth except with the power of Allah Which verse is it? / Ar-Rahman verse 13, Sis. / Mashaa Allah, you have a good memory. Chrysant flowers. Right, ma'am? chrysantemum morifolium. This flower is often used as herbal drinks. According to NASA's research, this could filter the air from formaldehyde, trichlorethylene, benzene, xylene, and ammonia. these substances are dangerous for health. common symptoms are eyes irriation.. / So, how? Do you want to be in my blog? In my book, promises must be kept Now explain to me, what kind of vlog do you want? I'll make a video all about astronaut's life About rockets, about the world of space, about its history too. The point is, my friends who'll watch this video will know how the life of an astronaut is Hello, I'm Aqila. In this vlog I'm with Mrs. Tsurayya. If you don't know Mrs. Tsurayya yet, she's an Indonesian female astronaut. Isn't that cool? So here, Mrs. Tsurayya and I will tell you all about astronauts. If you want to know more, keep on watching my vlog! Are you ready, Sis? / Ready! "An astronaut will be thrown from earth using a rocket. The principle works the same as this firecracker or water rocket. / One two Three..." The action of the force reaction on gas and water can make this bottle thrown To adapt in non-gravitating space, an astronaut will practice a lot under water. The aim is to get used to the body without weight and to breathe with oxygen. An astronaut must always physical train. Both before and during the time in space You're not strong for this? / I'm fasting ma'am If anyone thinks riding a rocket is good. Try to imagine? Can you not scream on a roller coaster? Rocket glides much faster than this. Hi guys! It's already maghrib. I'm breaking fast. Mrs. Tsurayya told me, I can only bring limited food. And can't bring food with crumbs like this What's allowed is food like this apple. I'll eat first... This is good.. Assalammualaikum Grandpa's granddaughter /Waalaikummusalam, Grandpa. How's it there? Good? Yeah, like this. I miss eating fried chicken with Grandma's chili sauce. Ugh ...you're fasting, aren't you? Can't say that It's hard to find Indonesian food. Even if there is, it's not as good Oma's cook. Someone said that you wanted to join the Vlog competition? Have you made a Vlog with Mrs. Tsurayya? You wouldn't believe. I learn a lot about astronaut from her. She told me that for astronauts' training will have to dive, to ride simulators, in fact, astronauts also have to be able to fix all rockets. really cool .. Eh, but for me, Grandpa is the coolest. You can work in an observatory in the middle of a forest where sky is still dark. Is it good there? This observatory is one of the places to observe aurora. It's really beautiful. Here we go Grandpa, you're making me envious Eh .. By the way, I like listening to HarrisJ's song. Well, I saw Harris J photo at your workplace. He is british. Oh realy? / Yes, Grandpa. Later when you're there, please check. There might be Harris J. It's not possible if he goes there everyday. UK is big anyways. / Right... But if I could meet him, what would you say? I'd say, his songs are good. Make me remind of Allah and not to give up. Ouch .. My hand is trapped! Slow down please! So heavy... Slow down, careful! Wait a minute / Why? / What was that inside? Why so heavy? What was that? Wait, I also forgot. Oh yes, the boss said, his friend abroad loves stuff from Indonesia He's willing to pay high / Hold on, why did we take it from that place? From who? From who? Ouch, why did I forget again? Oh yes, I took it from museum's guard. / Oh really... Hello bos, it's alright boss, it's been sent. Say it again? Payment? Five hundred thousand, right? Alright, boss! Five hundred, five hundred... It's for you Alhamdulillah Too much / Eh, how much did I give you? / Seven hundred thousand. Should be five hundred thousand. Seven thousand. The boss just said, "seven hundred thousand, Bang Codet." / I heart it was, "five hundred thousand!" Why so insistent? Seven hundred thousand. I was on a call with him. / Five hundred thousand / Seven hundred thousand Five hundred thousand / Seven hundred thousand Seven hundred thousand / Five hundred thousand! / See! Change of two hundred huh? / Isn't it? / So it's five hundred, huh? Yes! Didn't I tell you? Seven hundred or five hundred was that? So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? Reclining on green cushions and beautiful fine carpets. So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? Blessed is the name of your Lord, Owner of Majesty and Honor. God Almighty speaks the truth It's late. Not sleepy yet? Memorizing Qur'an, dad. Test is coming up. Dad, what if I got the scholarship? / That'll be great.. But, I could help Mak for selling. If I'm at boarding school, how will it be? Don't worry, Zi. I've started working now. The income is not bad. Not bad, right? / The income is even bigger than what she makes everyday. I'll send this to Mak tomorrow. But dad, if ... / Don't worry. You don't need to think about me. You think about yourself. In regards to falling object in Agam yesterday, we found that it was an old Chinese rocket ... Indonesia's probability of the fall of space junk is quite high because we are located on the equator assalammu'alaikum Ma, have you heard of space junk falling in Agam? Yes, that was the news last week. Feels like some time ago there was a fall too. Why, Pa? It's okay Ma, be careful there! / You too. Especially you're alone there. Coal is one of the biggest mining commodities in Indonesia. Now, who among you can mention the locations which produce the coal? Aqila! / Yes ma'am .. Please point for / point what? / So you haven't been paying attention to me? For the others, who can help me here? / Me, ma'am / Please June! Coal is a commodity that is widely possessed by Indonesia. Mining is in several locations. for instance South Sumatra, West Sumatra, East Kalimantan and Papua. The biggest coal mining in Indonesia is Bukit Asam. Bukit Asam is located in Tanjung Enim, South Sumatra. Hi Qila! / Hi / Wh are you limp today? I've noticed lately you're not focused on studying Oh, really? / I know. It must be because of the vlog, right? Yes, my video this time is spectacular. / Oh, really? We'll see who wins. Okay.. / But you have to stay aware of the teachers.. / Why? Lately, some teachers have complained about your behaviour. Sleeping at class, not focused... Don't let to be reported to the principal. / Impossible You can see here I'll reprimand her, Sir Math teacher also said that she's never done her homework. So this is the feedback for you about Aqila Grandma, I'm leaving. / Where are you going? / Meet Mrs. Tsurayya Mom, I'm leaving / Where are you going? I've got an appoinment with Mrs. Tsurayya, mom. / Have you done your homework? Homework? I'll do it when I get home, mom Qila, I'm happy if you stay active. But you must remember that you're still in school. As a student, you have responsibilities. Anyway, finish your homework first and then you can leave. / Gosh, Mom ... I've got an appointment with Mrs. Tsurayya. She is busy, mom. It's hard to find time to meet her For me this is very important, Mm. You know I've always wanted to be an astronaut Maybe I don't really understand about the competition, Qila. But what I know is that an astronaut must also be good in school Assalamualaikum Ma'am / Waalaikumussalam Sorry, ma'am I'm late / It's okay. Have you asked your parents' permission to go here? Done, ma'am / Okay, let's do it! In the past America and the Soviet Union competed to go to space. Yuri Gagarin from the Soviet Union was the first human to make it into space. Shortly afterwards Alan Shepard from NASA was successful. And since then, technology has developed rapidly. smart phones that we use now can be connected with the help of satellites located in space. Now everyone in the world has no boundaries. That is why developed countries spend huge cost for space research. Research of space produces new technological discoveries that humans have never imagined before. Is that enough? Good ma'am ... / May I see? Ma'am, I want to ask, about when can humans live in space? Why did you ask that? The thing is, in movies there are many stories that tell humans will live in space. Isn't that right, ma'am? astronauts indeed have to keep on conducting research so that humans can someday live in space. So it's possible ma'am? When? When? It feels like it's been a long time since I was here When I was in school I used to come here often. I feel like I want to go back into the planetarium. Why not? Let's go, ma'am! Where did you learn to be so mischievous? / I am sorry. But I promise this was the first and the last one, mom. Just a little more, my video will be finished. Here... have a look What's going on? / My phone is gone! It's from Mrs. Tsurayya. Where is she? / She's gone this morning. She's back to Europe to continue her research. The robot that took the plant sample has gone back to the Earth. Thank you, Sis / You're welcome Assalamualaikum, Qila. Although our contact was very short. But I will not be able to forget you. Seeing you, reminds me of myself when I was your age I used to have a high curiosity. I was even imagining, if only I could plant something on another planet or even live on another planet. But while I was researching plants in space, there was one thing that I realized. That the earth is a perfect place for humans The nutrients and energy available on earth allow plants as complex as anything to live. Then from those plants, humans can live. Humans enjoy fruits and vegetables. Also eat animals that live from eating grass. Meanwhile, simple plant as algae cannot survive in space. So can humans live in space? I do not know. Too much sacrifice to send humans there. Including the impact on the universe such as space junk which will be scattered around the earth after decades What is clear, space research on life to date has not found the results as expected. Aqila, you keep fighting, alright? Hopefully we can meet again another time. Bang Codet, wait here first. It'll take a while because the seller is arriving a little late If so, I'll sleep first / Go ahead if you want to sleep, but don't sleep until dawn. Of course not, I will wake up during the time for fast breaking / Ok! The thing is is the boss said, "the goods must have arrived before dawn!" Undeerstood? /Got it / Got it / Understood. / OK.. Remember! Do not forget! / Of course I'll remember! / Great! I'm leaving now! Of course I'll remember! I'm not you, forget again, forget again. "What was this then?", Keep forgetting! I seek refuge in Allah from Satan the outcast, from his direct and indirect temptations In the name of God, most Gracious most Compassionate Taught the Qur'an Created man, taught him eloquence. The sun and the moon [move] by precise calculation, And the stars and trees prostrate. And the heaven He raised and imposed the balance That you not transgress within the balance. And establish weight in justice and do not make deficient the balance. And the earth He laid [out] for the creatures. Therein is fruit and palm trees having sheaths [of dates] And grain having husks and scented plants. So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? He created man from clay like [that of] pottery. And He created the jinn from a smokeless flame of fire. So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? [He is] Lord of the two sunrises and Lord of the two sunsets. So which of the favors of your Lord would you deny? God Almighty speaks the truth Shh .. Bang Codet! Eh why did you come here. Open the door! / Oh yes yes! Come on, quickly! Bro, thank you! Be Careful! / Hey, you go over there! / Ouch ... let's get in quickly! We're off, sir! / Okay, be careful .. Bang Codet can you drive faster? / Yes, I can. That, the police is chasing us? I wonder why? / Get over it, stop asking too many questions. Anyway, step on the gas! / Yes yes.. Come on, boss, pickup / Hello, who is this? Boss, danger boss. The police is chasing us, Bos! Why are you going at this hour? I told you to go at dawn! usually at dawn, the patrol is infrequent Didn't you say not at the dawn? I said, GO AT DAWN. You got it reserved, PIKUUUUN! Bro, can you go faster! Step on the gas! Don't get overtaken! Ouch, overtaken now. Is that police car? / Yes, I know! Alright, I'm out! / Come out! / Yes, sir. Pikun is making me stressful. Bad work, Pikun! Yes, good night, sir. Yes, I'm Fauzi. Come again, sir? Okay sir, good night. Fauzi, heading home? Let me drive you. No needs Mr. Ustadz. / Then, let me help to order an online motorcycle taxi for you. Yes, please / What's the address? / Fajar street Let's go to the front together. Kid, there's Fauzi in the front. / Fauzi? Wait a minute, Pa, I'm going to the front / okay, wait up in the front, alright? Mr. Toni once again I apologize for the troublesome nights / It's okay, this is our job, sir. Once again, thank you, Sir. / No worries / Please send my regards to Mr. Bambang. Alright, I'll pass it to him / Sir, I am sorry. Sir, I am really, really sorry. I'm off now / Please, sir. Alhamdulillah ... Allah, my Lord! I'm free .. Bro, thank you very much. Sorry for causing the trouble again. Sorry. It's okay. You didn't do anything wrong. Cause it's late, I'll drive you to your place. / Is it okay? / Of course, let's go! The police have just caught the mastermind of the theft of museum items whose initials is JG. The last few months the police have frequently received reports of stolen museum collections around Jakarta The alleged perpetrators of the theft will sell these items to a collector abroad Previously, the police had also arrested JG's men who were sending stolen goods to the Port. Indonesia has experienced the fall of space junk for several times. In the past year space junk fell in Sumenep and in Agam Lapan (National Aeronautics and Space Agency) was also informed that there would be giant space junk that would soon fall. (Chairperson of LAPAN: National Aeronautics and Space Agency) Every space junk always passes through the equator area. Indonesia has the probability of space junk to fall into Indonesia also has to do something like other countries in the world. Yes, the problem is that LAPAN's space researcher is rare. They are mostly on duty overseas. What about Mr. Albert, Sir? Mr. Albert just went to Germany. He will continue his doctoral program there. Mr. Muhammad, Mr. Arif, Mr. Budiman, Mr. Agus are also all currently completing doctoral programs. That's the problem sir. If only Mr. Wibowo did not go to England. He is very experienced with this problem. But Prof. Wibowo is very dedicated. Maybe he is willing to go back to Indonesia if there is a problem like this. That is a good idea. I call him now. What about Fauzi's father? / Alhamdulillah, it has been taken care of. I gave them assurance. So Fauzi's father can be free. So actually he was not involved. But he was framed. He was told to deliver goods, but he didn't know what they were. Why kiddo? / Astaghfirullah ... Why did you go to your sister's room? Let's go to your room. here we go let's try, okay? Does it work? It's okay, don't be sad. Paul, I'd need your advise. I was just asked to go home because Indonesia is facing the problem of space junk I was asked to lead the research on this issue Yes, every country is facing the same problem. Do you enjoy working here? I can't ask for more than this. Doing something we love at my age, is everyone's dream But my country is calling me home How was it, Zi? Eh, your Grandma is inside. Come on in. Waalaikummussalam ... Fauzi ... Alhamdulillah ... how was it? Can't you wait for the good news. Why did you go here? I miss you. I also want to hear good news from you. Spill it! I've changed my mind. Not going to boarding school here. It's better for me to go home. What do you mean? You didn't pass the selection? Didn't pass? I did. But it's better if I'm not taking the scholarship. Ouch. I don't understand! Why don't you want it? I came this far even in sick but I didn't mind, so I could you succeed I've been thinking that it's better for me to stay in hometown. I could sell Grandma to sell cracker. So Dad doesn't have to be bothered to find job and move here. If three of us are in hometown, we could help each other No! you underestimate me, Fauzi... If it's about cracker, I can make it with my eyes closed. About selling, there are neighbors who are willing to help. Don't think about me. Think about your future. That's what matters! Didn't you realize, Fauzi? Not all kids could memorize the Qur'an Or receive scholarship like you! Especially the son of a thug! You're different! Why did you think of me? Grandma and I don't need to be in your way. I'm used to live a hard life. Even before you were born, I'd lived a difficult life. Even when I've failed here, I could just go home and help your grandma to sell cracker again Or working on the field is okay too. Still own a land even it's small. What matters is that you think of your own way. So when you grow up you could be better. Don't be like me who always makes mistakes. I understand you are in doubt. Doubt no more. You have to be certain. For the sake of your future. It's a good fabric. Do you want it? / I'm good / I'll go inside, okay? Mom, the baloon is loose! Eat a lot. So you can grow faster. Qila, why are you not eating? You'll be limp. You've been fasting all day. This is the worst Lebaran.. / Don't say that... We should be grateful. Still be able to eat, to gather Allah said, "Whosoever is thankful I will bless more" That's not it, Grandma. I've never imagined my efforts to make videos would be in vain. Just because I forgot to lock the door! Don't be like that, Qila. Your little sister didn't do it on purpose. She's still a toddler, maybe she just wanted to play with you. Especially Sis Qila has been busy lately. Let's go to your room, shall we? Didn't you know? I had a big chance to come to astronaut's training center And I tried my best! It's just because of a silly incident! Qila, my good granddaughter. A believer is always convinced, Allah already has the best plan for him/her. I am happy that night we could help Fauzi. Try to imagine if nobody helped Fauzi. Poor him, right? Besides, you were the kind one yesterday. You asked me to help them, right? Actually what's worst is that we won't be able to celebrate with Grandpa But we still can talk through video call Eh, this is weird. He always picked up his phone for video call. But I couldn't reach him since yesterday. Happy Eid. Waalaikumussalam warahmatullah. Wow, long time no see grandpa's granddaughter... Hi little sis, come here honey Grandpa, can I tell you about my vlog? / Sure, but it's noisy here / Let's go there, Grandpa Still upset about the video? Did you know? Mrs. Tsurayya once asked me something About what? / Whether I'd still want to be an astronaut even if I didn't win the competiton What was your answer? Yes, I will keep on trying to become an astronaut. No matter what it takes. Even though I'm losing now. Right Aqila, you shouldn't give up. If we have goals, we must focus on achieving them. And the most important thing is that we have to And most importantly, our intentions are to seek God's blessing. I'm sad not because I didn't manage to enter the competition. Then what? Because I lost important documentation between me and Mrs. Tsurayya. If the video still existed, I would be able to watch the video whenever I want. And later, if my enthusiasm to become an astronaut is fading, I'll be able to tell that I once really wanted to be an astronaut Come here! Is this Aqila's house? / Yes, correct / So big.. Eh, like Bang Codet's voice? Bang Codet, how are you? / Good, sir. Minal Aidin Wal Faizin / Forgive my physical and emotional wrongdoings. Fauzi, are you good? Alhamdulillah. Let's just eat it! You must be hungry? / Yes, I haven't eaten yet. Qila, have you seen the video yet? / Video, what video? On the LAPAN contest webpage. Let's see. What are you doing, Zi? / Just watch first! Hi Aliens! Now I am on the bridge of tengku agung sultanah Latifah, which is above the Siak river Now we are at the edge of Bandar Sungai Jantan Siak. And we are on vacation. But this time is not an ordinary vacation. Right, Dad? This time we will meet someone special. Are you curios? To be an astronaut, it is very hard. There are lots of tests. At that time I was tested for a jet ... and diving test. Thank God I was born here, and grew up physically strong since I was a kid I had a lot of activities in nature. Starting from swimming, running, and cycling Like right now, I just finished cycling through Siak Aliens, that was my interview with an astronaut candidate from Siak. Thank you for watching! That's your friend? Yes That is my friend She didn't win either. Even though I think the video is OK. There is a video with your name. Hello, I'm Tsurayya. Sorry I had to make this video and upload it here. Actually I was waiting for a video from my friend, Aqila But after I waited until the registration deadline, the video had not been uploaded either. I don't know what happened until the video was not sent. But, because I had a copy of Aqila's material, I made this video for her. A kid who is eager to be an astronaut. The experiments in this video are the result of a discussion between Aqila and me. Meeting Aqila, I know that she didn't make this video for the competition only, but Aqila wanted to learn something from me. For me, the spirit of learning is a major asset to become a scientist. Aqila gave me a new spirit to remain to be a space researcher. I'm leaving! / Yes. What time will you go home? / After school, I'll go straight home. No more space activities? / You're always asking about homework now you're asking about that. Not yet. Nothing. I just want to know. Yes, go ahead. So you won't be late. Hi June / Hi, what's going on? LAPAN is having a new competition. / Sounds fun! Wanna try? / Sounds good! / We'll team up, ok? / Okay! Don't play firecrackers here. It's not a village here. / Yes, dad. I'll have to go now If your grandmother makes crackers, do you want to bring them? / Yes, dad / Not ashamed? / Nope. Alright then, I'm off now. Mom... Mrs. Tsurayya is inviting me to go to spacecraft Congratulations! I can't believe I could be invited by Mrs. Tsurayya to space center Feels like my dream to be an astronaut is getting closer And I can't wait to be the first human to live on another planet Until Grandpa asked me, what if I moved to another planet but couldn't return back to the Earth? Obviously I don't want it if I couldn't return Welcome, Professor, to National Space Center / Thank you! Hello, Aqilla, are you ready? We're going inside, professor. Grandpa is right. Maybe being an astronaut doesn't mean to stay on another planet But I have to be an astronaut that protects the Earth Like Grandpa said, whether an astronaut or anything, we can be helpful It's up to us. Whether want to be true to our heart? Or have we taken the right path? Here you go, Grandpa / Your favorite food How are you? Everything good? Hi, I'm Aqila. I like your songs. Thank you so much. I've heard a lot about you. Your grandpa told me alot about you. I heard you have a big dream. InsyaAllah if you keep on trying, I'm praying for you to succeed Thank you / Have you tried the food around here?
