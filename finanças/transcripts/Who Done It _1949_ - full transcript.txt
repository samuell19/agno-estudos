[♪] RADIO NEWSCASTER: Ah, there's grim news tonight. Once more, the Phantom gang has struck, and terror stalks through the city. Another prominent citizen has disappeared, and men are asking, "Who will be next?" Don't do that! But, sir, I'm worried. Uh, you may be next. Me? Oh, no. No, nonsense. There's nothing to worry about. Uh, I'm not worried. No, I'm-- I'm not-- Where are those detectives? They promised to be here an hour ago. [GLASS SHATTERS] "You will be next." Operator. Operator. Get me the Alert Detective Agency. How should I know the number? The Alert Detective Agency. [PHONE RINGING] [GROANS] [STOOGES GRUNTING] [PHONE CONTINUES RINGING] Help me with this thing. Okay. What's the matter, boys? Yeah, we've been robbed. Hey, we gotta get going. What does your watch say? Don't say nothing. You gotta look at it. Oh. Get outta here. Answer the phone. I'll answer it when I'm ready. Yeah? Oof! I'm ready. [PHONE RINGING] Hello? Oh, yes, Mr. Goodrich. I'm sorry, we were tied up. He means we were detained. We're on our way, though. Uh, that's fine. Thanks. Uh, goodbye. There. I feel a lot safer already. [SCREAMS] [GRUNTING] Very neatly done, Nikko. Take him away. Uh, but, sir, Mr. Goodrich phoned. The detectives are on their way. Detectives. That's not good. Don't worry, my sweet. They won't stay long. [CHUCKLING] Sleeping pills. The permanent kind. Ooh. Heh-heh! Ha-ha-ha! [DOORBELL RINGS] Stand where you are. We're detectives. What's going on around here? Well-- Search the suspect. Suspect? The butler's always a suspect. Hold it for a still. Good. Okay. I think he moved. Wait a minute. What did you find? Only this. Why, you... Ooh! Hold it. Your watch. Would you step in here, please? Boy, what a creepy-looking joint. Swell place for a murder. Cut that out. Yeah, don't talk like that. Nothing's gonna happen. Absolutely nothing. Come on. He's right. What could happen? I guess I'm just the nervous type, I guess. [CHUCKLES] Hello. ALL: Oh, hello. We're detectives. Mr. Goodrich sent for us. Oh? I'm his niece. The niece is nice. Heh-heh! Hold on. We're here on business. I mean business. Oh-- Wait a minute. Why, you... Hold it. You know what this means. You can't give it to me-- [GRUNTS] Oh, the glass. Hmph. I'm framed. I'm afraid something dreadful has happened. Uncle has disappeared. No. He was sitting right over there. Suddenly... I heard a scream! [STOOGES YELP] Let go of me, will you? Then he was gone. Well, don't worry. We'll take care of everything. We'll find fingerprints. Get the camera ready. Come on, eagle. Get busy. Oh. Oh! What's the matter? Nothing. I-- Get that letter. Which one? That one. [SCREAMING] Go on over and look for fingerprints. Oh, look at that. It's got that polymer written on it. But I'll fix that. Stop down a quarter of a mile. That's about right. Somebody left some hypo in there. Oh, highly polished mahogany. And termites with big blue eyes. I-- Get out of here. Oof! Fingerprints. Ready with the camera. Right, ready with the camera. Coming right up. Smile. Cut it out. [SNIFFING] The fingerprints. Oh! Tend to business. Oh! No! Moe! Larry, help! There was an ugly-looking thing staring right at me. It was horrible. What do you know? It was you. [BOTH LAUGH] You imbecile. We're getting no place fast. Oh! May I make a suggestion? Yeah. Certainly. Why not separate and search the place? What an idea. Brilliant. But certainly. One of you come with me. Yes, I-- Come here. Wait-- Wait a minute. I heard what the lady said. MOE: Come on. Leave us leave, my sweet. Oh. Don't you raise your hand to me. Now, don't you go get yourselves murdered. Oh, don't worry about us. Murdered? Aah! Turn me loose. Like I told Shemp, there's nothing to be afraid of. Not a thing. Of course not. Then spread out. Okay, I'm raring to go. Before we start, let's have a little drink. Oh, boy, that's for me. Now, don't go away. Oh, I won't. Hm, nice picture. Yes, isn't it? So natural. It looked like the trees moved. [CHUCKLES] Yes, sir, I sure enjoy good pictures. Well, then, I'm sure you'll like that one. Oh, yes, nice. Very nice. But, you know, uh, I like that one much better. Oh, you do, do you? Ha-ha. It's by a very famous painter. The same one who painted that one. Oh, charming, charming. But my favorite is, uh, that one. It is lovely. Yes, it is lovely. [LAUGHS] Well, cheerio. A couple of pip-pips, a little barbecue, and what have you? [BOTH CHUCKLE] A short life and a merry one. You ain't kiddin'. How do you feel, kiddo? Fine. Fine. And you? Oh, great. I never felt better in my life. I'll never forget that-- Eee! [HIGH-PITCHED WHEEZING] [GASPING] [SCREECHING] [CHITTERING] [WHEEZING] [SCREECHING] Take it easy, kid. Hey, what happened? [WHEEZING] That dame tried to poison me. She's gone. Hey, a secret panel. There must be a secret panel. You take that wall. Where to? Go ahead. You look back there. Hm. Oh! Oh, oh! Oh! [FRUSTRATED WHINE] [LAUGHS] Oh! Oh, oh! Shemp, Larry! Shemp! Oh-oh-oh-oh! What's the matter? Something hit me on the head. What? I don't know. Oh, you think I'm goofy. Yeah. Well, I'll show you. Get over there. You get over here. Move that gadget. I'll tell you when. When. [YELLING] LARRY: What? Something hit me again. That picture. You're crazy. How could a picture hit you? How? He asked me, how it could hit me? Come here. Right there. You, right there. Go ahead, move it. [YELLING] That's how. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Oh! [FRUSTRATED WHINE] Oh, you... [SCREAMS] Let's get out of here. [STOOGES WHIMPER] [LOCK CLICKS] Hey, who was that guy? I don't know, but he don't like us. A guy can get killed around here. Yeah, let's scram. Wait a minute. We're private detectives, ain't we? BOTH: Yeah. In movies does a private eye give up? BOTH: No. But you softies wanna quit like cowards, just because you might get killed. BOTH: Yeah. That's a great idea. Let's go. Hey, the window. [GROANS] SHEMP: Hey, the phone. Let's call the cops. Yeah. Help! Help! It's dead. We're in a tough spot, men. Yeah, it's gonna take brains to get us out of here. That's why I said we're in a tough spot. [CHIRPING] Shut up. This is no time for singing. [YELLING] Let go of my arm. Ooh! [CONTINUES CHIRPING] Why, you... What's the matter with you? Oh! Why, you...

[BOTH YELLING] I guess that takes care of Handsome Harold. Boy, you're a genius. Nice work, kid. Oh, it's nothin'. It's nothin' at all. Ha-ha! I'll never forget the first time I saved a couple of guys. It was in a poolroom. Ha-ha! A guy walks in, he says, "Stick 'em up." I says, "Nothin' scares me." Will you cut it out? Cut it out. He says, "Yeah?" And I says, "yeah" right back at him. Give him-- What's the matter with you? I'm tired. Will you go and--? Aah! Moe. Larry. A corpus. A corpus. MOE: It's old man Goodrich.
