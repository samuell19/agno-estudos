That is to capture, in a single theatrical performance, The magic, the genius, the towering grandeur, Of the complete works of William Shakespeare. Now we've got a lot to get through tonight, So at this time, I'd like to introduce a member of the company Who is one of California's preeminent Shakespearian scholars.

Thank thee. Thanks! Thank you. Thank you, and good evening, ladies and gentlemen William Shakespeare. Playwright, poet, actor, philosopher. A man whose creative and literary genius Has had immeasurably profound influence Upon the consciousness and culture of the entire English speaking world And yet, how much do we really know? I mean, how much do we really appreciate The tremendous body of work contained In this single volume? Well, not enough is the answer And I believe I can illustrate this by giving a brief poll amongst the audience. Bob, can I get some House lights on please? Oh, yes. Now, you're a theatre-going crowd No doubt of an above average cultural and literary awareness And yet, if I could just have a brief show of hands: How many of you have ever seen or read any play by William Shakespeare? Any play at all by the Bard? Just raise your hand It doesn't matter which... We better get out of here, they don't know... Austin, they don't know Shakespeare from shinola Just keep going. Narrow it down. Let's see if we can narrow it down a bit, shall we? Um, how many of you have ever seen or read All's Well That Ends Well? All's Well, anyone? Yes, so that seems to be separating the wheat from the chaff rather nicely Let's see if we can find out who the true Shakespeare trivia champs are here tonight How many of you have ever seen or read King John? King John in... Oh yeah, right. Well would you mind telling us what it's all about? No, no, don't ask her, no, no, no, I'm... I'm talking... Ladies and gentlemen, you laugh, you scoff but let he or she among you who is free from sin live in a glass house I submit to you.

Oh, shit No, no, let me get it, they go in order So just let me get... I got it. Okay, what I did was I've just written a few notes on Shakespeare's life Just to get the show off to a good start Just so like everybody can know all the stuff that he did and everything As you can see, I'm not actually an audience member, I completely fooled you Okay. Okay. William Shakespeare William Shakespeare was born in 1564 in the town of Stratford-Upon-Avon, Warwickshire The third of eight children he was the eldest son of John Shakespeare a locally prominent merchant, and Mary Arden, daughter of a Roman... Catholic member of the Landed Gentry. In 1582, he married Anne Hathaway Shakespeare arrived in London in 1588 And by 1592, he had achieved success as an actor and a playwright After 1608, his dramatic production lessened, and it seems that he spent more time in Stratford There he dictated to his secretary, Rudolf Hess, the work Mein Kampf... In which he set forth this program for the restoration of Germany to a dominant position in Europe After reoccupying the Rhineland Zone between France and Germany and annexing Austria, the Sudetenland, and the remainder of Czechoslovakia... Shakespeare invaded Poland on September 1, 1939 Thus precipitating World War II I never knew that before Okay, okay Shakespeare remained in Berlin when the Russians entered the city on April 1, 1945 And committed suicide with his mistress, Eva Peron. He lies buried in the church at Stratford Thank you very much, that's all I've got And now, without further ado, the Reduced Shakespeare Company is proud to prevent the Complete Works of William Shakespeare: Abridged! All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players They have their exits and their entrances, and one man in his time plays many parts One man in his time plays many parts: how true! Ladies and gentlemen, where better to begin our exploration into the complete works of the greatest of all English playwrights than in Verona, Italy With two of his most beloved characters, Romeo and Juliet! Now, Adam and Reed are going to assist me by portraying all the major characters in Romeo and Juliet While I fill in with bits of crucial narration. We begin with the prologue. Two households, both alike in dignity, in fair Verona, where we lay our scene, from ancient grudge breaks a new mutiny, where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. From forth the fatal loins of these two foes, a pair of star-crossed lovers take their life. Huah! Whose misadventure piteous o'erthrows, do, with their death, bury their parents' strife. Thank you very much Act 1, Scene 1. In the street meet two men, tall and handsome One, Benvolio. The other named Sampson Their hatred fueled by an ancient feud, for one serves Capulet, the other, Montague-d. Oh, it's him. I hate him, his family, hate his dog, hate 'em all. Do you bite your thumb at me, sir? No, sir, I do but bite my thumb. Do you bite your thumb at me, sir? No sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir but I do but bite my thumb. Do you quarrel, sir? Quarrel, sir? No, sir! But if you do, sir, I am for you, a serve as good a man as you. Hah! No better. Yes. Better. You lie! Montague! I'm twisting your hand! Argh! This is really gonna hurt you! Rebellious subjects! Uh-oh, it's the Prince! Enemies to the peace, profaners of this neighbor-stain√©d steel You, Capulet, shall go along with me. Benvolio, come you this afternoon to know our farther pleasure in this case. Sorry Oh, where is Romeo? Saw you him today, Right glad I am, he was not at this fray. Ah, but see, he comes! Romeo, he cried, I will know his grievance, Or be much denied. Good morrow, cuz. Is the day so young? But new struck nine. Ay, me. Sad hours seem long. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours? Not having that which, having, makes them short. In love? Out. Of love? Out of her favor, where I am in love. Alas, that love, so gentle in his view, Should be so rough and tyrannous in proof. Alas that love, whose view is muffled Still, should without eyes see pathways to his will. Oh! Go ye to the feast of Capulets. There sups the fair Rosalind whom thou so lovest with all the admired beauties of Verona. Go thither, and compare her face with some that I shall show, oh baby And I shall make thee think thy swan a crow. I'll go along! No such sight to be shown, but to rejoice in splendor of mine own. And, so much for Act 1 It wasn't that good. Now to the feast of Capulet, where Romeo is doomed to meet his Juliet And where, in a scene of timeless romance, he'll try to get into Juliet's pants. Oh, she doth teach the torches to burn bright. Did my heart love 'till now? Forswear it, sight. For I ne'er saw true beauty 'till this night. If I profane with my unworthiest hand, this holy shrine, the gentle fine is this: My lips, two blushing pilgrims ready stand to smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss Oh, good pilgrim you do wrung your hands too much, which mannerly devotion shows in this. For saints have hands that pilgims' hands do touch, and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss. Have not saints lips and holy palmers too? Ay, pilgrim. Lips they must use in prayer. Oh then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do Saints do not move, though grant for prayer's sake. Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take. Then from my lips the sin that they have took. Oh, sin from my lips? Trespass, sweetly urged. Give me my sin again! - Look, I don't wanna kiss you, man. - Look, it's on the script. I don't care, God, I just... Um, you kiss by the book - Oh, coming Mother... - Is she a Capulet? Ay, so I fear. The more is my unrest. Just pretend you're not there. What are you doing? The balcony scene. Oh. Um. But soft! What light through yonder window breaks? Oh, Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou, Romeo? Deny thy father and refuse thy name or if thou wilt not be but sworn my love And I'll no longer be a Capulet. [Snort.] Okay, what's in a name, anyway? That which we call a nose by any other name could still smell So Romeo, what, oh, Romeo doth thy name, and for thy name which is no part of thee take all my self Okay, there is I take thee at thy word. Call me but love, and I shall be new baptized Henceforth I shall never be Romeo But men art thou. Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague? - Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike. - Dost thou love me, then? I know thou wilt say I and I will take thy word, yet if thou swearest thou may as prove false Oh, Romeo, if thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully - Lady, by yonder blessed moon, I swear - Swear not by the moon! What shall I swear by, then? I don't know. Not the moon. How 'bout her? - Swear by her - Lady, by yonder blessed virgin, I swear I don't think so. No. No, no, do not swear at all, though I joy in thee, I have no joy in this contract tonight It is too rash, too sudden, too inadvised; too like the lightning Which doth cease to be 'ere one can say it lightens - Oh, Romeo - Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? - What satisfaction canst thou have? - The exchange of thy most faithful vows for mine Oh, I did give it thee before thou didst request it Three words, gentle Romeo, and then good night indeed If that thy bent of love be honorable, thy purpose marriage, Send Word Tomorrow. One, Two, Three. Good night, good night, parting is such sweet sorrow Bye-bye. Sleep well in thine eyes, peace in thy breasts Oh, that I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest Lo, Romeo did swoon with love. By Cupid, he'd been crippled But Juliet had a loathsome curse, whose loathsome name was Tybalt Romeo! The love I bear thee can afford no better trim than this: thou art a villain Therefore turn and draw! Tybalt, I do protest! I never injured thee, but love thee, better than thou give Oh, thou wretched boy, I aim for you! Oh, I am slain. Moving right along. From Tybalt's death onward The lovers are cursed. Despite the best efforts of the friar and nurse Their fate persues them; they can't seem to duck it And at the end of Act 5, they both kick the bucket Gallop a pace, you firey-footed steeds! And bring in cloudy night immediately. Come, night, come civil night, come Romeo, thou day and night Come gentle night, come loving black proud night Oh, night, night, night, night Come, come, come, come, come I didn't write it! And bring me my Romeo! Tuck your boobies in. Oh, can heaven be so envious! Oh, Romeo, Romeo, who would have thought it, Romeo? What devil art thou to torment me, thus? It's actually rude to torment me Is Romeo gone and Tybalt slain? No, Juliet, Tybalt is gone, and Romeo is banished Romeo, who killed Tybalt, he is banished Oh, God. Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood? It did, it did, alas the day, it did Thank you so much. Now Romeo lives Now Romeo lives who Tybalt would have slain, and Tybalt is dead He that would have killed my husband Oh, friar Laurence! Juliet, I already know thy grief. Take now this vial, and this distilled liquor drink thou of And presently through all thy veins, shall run a cold and drowsy humor Oh, I feel a cold and drowsy humor running through my veins, Obi Wan Just say no! Oh, no! Oh my love, my wife, death that has set the honey of thy breath hath no power yet upon thy beauty - Why art thou yet so fair? - I don't know Shall I believe that unsubstantial death is amorous? To keep me here in the dark, to be his paramour? Here's to my love. Oh, true apothecary, thy drugs are quick Thus with a kiss, I die Thus, with a kiss... Get over it... I die. Good morning! Where, oh, where is my love? What's this? Poison, I see, hath been my true love's timeless end Oh, churl, drunk all and left no friendly drop to help me after Then I'll be brief. Happy dagger this is thy sheath! That's Romeo for ya' Oh, my head! Oh, my brain! There rust, and let me die! Epilogue: A glooming peace, this morning with it brings, the sun, for sorrow, will not show its head Go forth, to have more talk of these sad things. Some shall be pardoned, and some, punished For never was it there a story of more woah than this of Juliet and her Romeo And Romeo and Juliet are dead! Ladies and gentlemen, in preparing this unprecedented complete works show We've encountered the difficulty of trying to make these four-hundred year old plays accessible to a modern audience Now, one popular trend is to transpose Shakespeare's tales into modern settings And we've seen evidence of this with productions of Shakespeare's plays Set in such unusual locations as the lunar landscape, Nazi prisoner of war camps, and even Vancouver Now - God bless you - in this vein, Austin has traced the roots of Shakespeare's symbolism In the context of a pre-Nietzschian society Through the totality of a jejune circular relationship of form Contrasted with the complete otherness of metaphysical cosmologies And the ethical mores entrenched in the collective subconscious of an agrarian race So, we now present Shakespeare's first tragedy, Titus Andronicus, as a cooking program Good evening, ladies and gentlemen Good evening, gourmets And welcome to Roman Meals. I'm your host, Titus Andronicus. Now look When you've had a long day, your left hand chopped off Your sons murdered, your daughter raped Her tongue cut out, both her hands chopped off Well, the last thing you wanna do is cook, you know what I mean? Unless of course, you cook the rapist and serve him to his mother at the dinner party My daughter, Lavinia, and I will show you how! Good evening Lavinia! And how are we feeling today? Not so good, I got my tongue chopped out. I know, it's a pisser, isn't it? But we'll have our revenge, won't we? Now, hark villain, I will grind your bones to dust, and of your blood in it I'll make a paste and of that paste a coffin I will rear, and make a pasty of your shameful head - Come, Lavinia, receive the blood - Okey-dokey Now first thing you wanna do is make a nice clean incision from the carotid artery to the jugular vein - Like so - Oh, that's gross Yeah. Now, be sure to use a big bowl Because the human body's got about four quarts of blood in it And you don't wanna miss a single drop; forget about it Now, whenever he's dead, which should be, now I will grind his bones into powder small, And with this hateful liquor temperate, and in that paste let his vile head be baked At about 350 degrees. And 40 minutes later, you have the most delicious human-head-pie, fit to serve a king With some lovely lady fingers for desert Now, who will be the first to try this delicious taste treat? Welcome gracious lord, welcome great queen, will please you eat, will please you feed? C'mon, it's finger-licking good! Good one, man, high-five! Well, that's about all the time we have, thanks so much for tuning in And do join us next week, when our very special guest chef Timon of Athens will make a lovely ratatouille out of the Merry Wives of Windsor And until then, BONE-Appetite! Thank you very much! I hope no one was too offended by Titus Andronicus Shakespeare as a young writer seems to have gone through a brief Quentin Tarantino phase But, we shall now move on to explore the genius evident in Shakespeare's more mature work As we present his dark and brooding tragedy, Othello, the Moor of Venice Speak of me as I am, nothing extenuate, one who loved not wisely, but too well For never was there a story of more woe than this of Othello and his Desdemona Ah, Dese! Bob, could we have some lights, please? Uh, we left Adam on his own to research this play Uh, apparently he looked up 'moor' in the dictionary and thought it was a place where you tie up boats - That's what it told me - Which obviously in this context is obviously totally ridiculous Because, in the 16th century, the word 'moor' referred to a black person I feel like such a dork Yeah, well, go with the feeling Look, ladies and gentlemen, we obviously have some difficulty in even performing Othello because, as you know, the part is written for a black actor - And we are - I guess you might say that we're, uh, racially challenged Exactly, so the bottom line is we're not going to be able to perform Othello for you tonight, I'm very sorry about it No, no, Austin, Austin, we can do it, we can do it. I've got an idea that's totally boatless If we just, aham, If we just get like a rhythm going, y'know? Like a Like a: "Here's a story of a brother by the name of Othello" "He liked white women, and he liked... green jello" Oh yeah, yeah And a punk named Iago Who made himself a menace, 'cause he didn't like Othello The moor of Venice And Othello got married to Desdemona He took her for the wars, and left her alone-a He was a moan-a, a groan-a, he left her alone-a He didn't write a letter, and he didn't telephon'er Desdemona she was faithful, she was chastity-tight She was the daughter of a Duke, yeah, she was totally white And Iago loved Dese like Adonis loved Venus And Dese loved Othello 'cause he had a big... SWORD Iago, he said, "I'm gonna shaft the Moor" How you gonna do it, tell us! Well, I know his tragic flaw: he's too damn jealous I need a dupe, a dope, a kind of schmo, so he found himself a sucker by the name of Casio And he plants on him Desdemona's handkercheifs So Othello gets to wondering just maybe if While he been out fighting, commanding an army, are Dese and Cas playin' hide the salami? S-s-s-s-sala-salami! So he comes back home he's got a pillow in her face He kills her and soliloquizes about his disgrace But there's Amelia at the door, who we met in Act 4 Who say, "You big dummy, she weren't no whore!" She was pure, she was clean, she was virginal, too So why'd you have to go, and make her face turn blue?" It's true! It's you! Now what'chu gonna do? And Othello say, "Damn, this is getting pretty scary" Pull out his blade, and committed Hari-Kari Do that funky Moor-thing, white boy! - That is so hot, man - Iago got caught, but he probably copped a plea Lured up his bags and moved to Beverly Hills, that is. Whoo! Hey guys, uh, let's lighten up from all the heavy tragedy, and do some of the comedies for a while - Word. Let's totally - Okay, okay When it came to comedies, Shakespeare was a genius At borrowing and adapting plot devices from different theatrical traditions This influences include the Roman plays of Plautus and Terence Ovid's "Metamorphoses", which are hysterically funny. As well as the rich Italian tradition of commedia dell'arte Yeah, basically, Shakespeare stole every comedy he ever wrote No, no, STOLE is a really strong word distilled, maybe Okay he distilled the three or four funniest comic gimmicks of his time And then he milked them into 16 plays You see, basically Shakespeare was a formula writer Once he found a device that worked he used it over and over and over again So, Mr. Shakespeare, the question we have is this: Why did you write 16 comedies, when you could've written just one? Well, in answer to this question, we of the Reduced Shakespeare Company have taken the liberty of condensing All 16 of Shakespeare's comedies into a single play Which we have entitled: The comedy of two well-measured gentlemen lost in the Merry Wives of Venice on a Midsummer's Twelfth Night in Winter Or: Cymbeline Taming Pericles, the Merchant in the Tempest of Love As Much As You Like It For Nothing Or: Four weddings and a transvestite. Act I. A Spanish Duke swears an oath of celibacy And turns the rule of his kingdom over to his sadistic and tyrannical twin brother He learns some fantastical feats of magic And sets sail for the Golden Age of Greece Along with his daughters, three beautiful and virginal set of identical twins While rounding the heel of Italy, the Duke‚Äôs ship is caught in a terrible tempest Which, in its fury, casts the Duke upon a desert island Along with the loveliest and most virginal of his daughters Who stumbles into a cave, where she is molested by a creature who is either a man, or a fish, or both Act II. The longlost sons of the Duke's brother, also coincidentally three sets of identical twins Have just arrived in Italy Though still possessed of an inner nobility, they are ragged, destitute, penniless, flea-infested shadows of the men they once were And in the utmost extremity are forced to borrow money from an old Jew Who deceives them into putting down their brains as collateral on the loan Now, the six brothers fall in love with six Italian sisters Three of whom are contentious, sharp-tongued little shrews While the other three are submissive, airheaded little bimbos Act III. The ship wrecked, the identical daughters of the Duke wash up on the shores of Italy Disguise themselves as men, become pages to the shrews and matchmakers to the Duke's brother's sons They lead all the lovers into a nearby forest, where, on a midsummer's night, A bunch of mischievous fairies squeeze the aphroditic juice of a hermaphroditic flower into the shrews' eyes Causing them to fall in love with their own pages, who, in turn, have fallen in love with the Duke's brother's sons While the queen of the fairies seduces a jackass, and they all have an orgy Act IV. The elderly fathers of the Italian sisters, finding their daughters missing Dispatch messages to the pages telling them to kill any man in the vicinity However, unable to find men in the forest, the faithful messengers, in a final misguided act of loyalty Deliver the messages to each other and kill themselves Meanwhile, the fish creature and the Duke arrive in the forest disguised as Russians And, for no apparent reason, perform a two-man underwater version of "Uncle Vanya" Act V. The Duke commands the fairies to right their wrongs The pages and the bimbos get into a knock-down, drag-out fight in the mud During which the pages' clothes get ripped off, revealing female genitalia The Duke recognizes his daughters The Duke's brother's sons recognize their uncle One of the shrews is elected Senator from New York And they all get married and go out to dinner Except for a minor character in the second act, who gets eaten by a bear And the Duke's brother's sons, who, unable to pay back the old Jew, give themselves lobotomies And they all live happily ever after Thank you! What we would like to do in this juncture time Is return quickly to the rest of Shakespeare's tragedies Because, basically, we found that the comedies are not as funny as the tragedies So, we would like to start this section of the show with Shakespeare's Scottish play, Macbeth Which you're really not supposed to talk about in the theatre Unless you are performing it Because it's cursed Uhu, very scary! Fortunately, our Reduced Shakespeare Company not only performs an abbreviated version of Macbeth But, after much thorough research, we are able to do so in perfect Scottish accents Double, double, toil, and trrrouble Stay, ye, imperrrfect (Mac)speaker. (Mac)tell me (Mac)morrre Macbeth... Macbeth... Bewarrre Macduff No man of woman born shall harm Macbeth 'Till Birnam Wood come to Dunsmane, don't ye know? That's dead great. Then (Mac)what (Mac)need (mac)I (Mac)fear of Macduff? See you, Jimmy! And know that Macduff was from his mother's womb untimely ripped! What d'ye think about that? Ooh! That's bloody disgusting! Lay on, your great haggis-breath ye'! Ah, Macbeth! Ye killed my wife, ye murdered my bairns, ye did a job in my stoup - Rrr, I didnae - Rrr, you did! - Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr - Rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr I hadn't throw half of it away! Behold where stands the usurper's cursed head Ah, Macbeth! yer arse is oot the windee And know that never was there a story of more blood and death Than this of Mr. and Mrs. Macbeth Thank you! Meanwhile, Julius Caesar was a much beloved tyrant All hail Julius Caesar! Hail, citizens! - Who was warned by a soothsayer - Beware the Ides of March The great Caesar, however, chose to ignore the warning What the hell are the "Ides of March"? Well, that's the 15th of March That's today! Et tu, Brutus? Friends, Romans, countrymen! Lend me your ears! I come to bury Caeser, so let's bury him, and get on to my play, Antony... And Cleopatra! Is this an asp I see before me? Oh, I'm dying! I've been bit by a snake It's the venom! It's all over through my blood! Adam, stop it! Adam... Poison! Will you come down? What? You have this really bizarre notion that all of Shakespeare's tragedies' heroines Wear this really ugly wigs, and vomit on people before they die - It's an interpretation, man! - No! Barfing on people is not an interpretation! Just get up here! He was into it! Antony and Cleopatra is not some Alka-Seltzer commercial It's a romantic thriller about a geopolitical power struggle between Egypt and Rome Oh, yeah! Like you knew! You like all laughing... I'm sorry! I apologize! I apologize, you know? If I had known this was Shakespeare's geopolitical play, I wouldn't have screwed around with it because my favorite plays are his geopolitical plays - Really, really? - No, seriously, they're intense, man, like, um... What was that one he wrote about nuclear energy in the former Soviet Union? It was way ahead of its time. It was a metaphor... wrapped in an allegory It was totally intense, man. It was called "Chernobyl Kinsmen," and it was all about this... Adam, Adam, Shakespeare wrote a play called "Two Noble Kinsmen" Not "Chernobyl Kinsmen"! "Two Noble Kinsmen"! - "Cher..." - "Two" - There was definitely a "Cher"! - "Two"! "Two"! - "Two... Noble Kinsmen"! - "Cher...", "Cher...", "Cherno..." What's "Two Noble Kinsmen" about? "Two Noble Kinsmen" is about a girl who goes insane with the fear That her boyfriend is going to be eaten by wolves, and her father, hanged - And is Boris Yeltsin in it? - No, NO!!! I never heard of that play before, I'm sorry... Actually once... Oh, wait a second... I should explain to these guys I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen, my bad! Listen! "Two Noble Kinsmen" actually falls in the category of Shakespeare's plays That we scholars refer to as "the apocrypha" Um, or in some literary circles "the obscure plays" Um, and sometimes "the lesser plays" And, um, and often quite simply "the bad plays" But, but the part is not all of "the apocrypha" are entirely without merit In fact, one of them, "Troilus and Cressida", is hardly crap at all In fact, I discussed "Troilus and Cressida" at some lenght in my new soon-to-be-released book about Shakespeare entitled "I love my Willy" Which I‚Äôd like to whip out for you now, if I could... What? What? No. No, it's my book Anyway, I was thinking what we could do Is a quick, sort of improvised version of Troilus and Cressida based on this chapter Yeah, we could do an interpretive dance, performance art version! Performance art, I love performance art It's so... pretentious! We could do a piece that uses the text of Troilus and Cressida As like a jumping-off point to explore deeper themes, you know? Like the transient nature of life, and the mythology involved in the arising and dissipation of forms Yeah, get some props! Wait, I was thinking we could do just a very straightforward scholarly approach - No, screw that! - Let's go ahead! All right, okay. Let's start. Um, Troilus and Cressida Was written in 1603, published in 1604 And is in the "First Folio" Although that version is some 166 lines longer than the version which appears in the "Second Folio" Which is about 166 lines shorter than the version which appears in the "First Folio" Now, they describe the play in the "First Folio" as a "history", but later became known as a "comedy" And it's now known... No, get rid with it! Get that out of here! Get that out of here! What the hell are you.. Get rid of it! Just go! Wait, wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait, wait! Get a life, ladies and gentlemen! My book has nothing to do with Godzilla! Awesome, that's great! But there is anything in the book about the plot? Of course I cover the plot! What sort of scholar do you think I am? I cover the plot in-depth in the footnote here on page 7, all right? All right, look! "Troilus, youngest son of Priam, King of Troy" Okay, you'll be Troilus, he'll be the King of Troy All right! "loves Cressida" - I'll get the wig! - All right, great! And has arranged with her uncle Pandarus for a meeting - Although she feigns indifference - Oh, wait a minute... She is attracted to him. Meanwhile, Agamemnon, the Greek commander, has surrounded... Kids hate to study it at school because it‚Äôs so boring C'mon, as soon as you said "Agamemnon", I was asleep, man! I'm sorry, but we came here to London, I told these guys, I said, "I will not do dry, boring, vomitless Shakespeare" No, that just turns you off. That's what happened to me when I was a kid in school And we were supposed to be studying Shakespeare It's like I'd be boiling it out of my mind, I'd be looking out the window, and all the kids playing ball And I'd be sitting myself like, "why can't Shakespeare stuff be more like sports?" That's... that's what I've got! That's what I was thinking... - You like sports? - I did like sports, yes! And you went to High School? - Yes, in a matter of fact, I did - Okay, well, whatever... Because, check it out, sports are visceral, you know? They are engaging It's like, um, you know, if you look at Shakespeare's histories In the histories, the valorous kings They are killing each other off They are passing the throne from one generation to the next It's exactly like American Football Only with a dude with a crown You know what? They are kind of similar 25, 42, Richard III, Henry VI part I, II, III, hike! And the crown is snapped to Richard II, that well spoken 14th century monarch He‚Äôs fading back to pass, looking for an heir downfield, but there‚Äôs a heavy rush from King John My gross flesh sinks downwards! The crown is in the air, and Henry VI comes up with it! Victory is mine! But he‚Äôs immediately hit by King John. He‚Äôs cutting Henry VI into three parts This is going to be be the end of the War of the Roses Cycle! King John is in the clear - My soul hath elbow room - He‚Äôs in the 35 yard line The 30, the 25, the 20 The 15, the 10... He is poisoned on the 1 yard line He is out of the game Replacing him now: number 72, King Lear Divide my kingdom in 3. Cordelia, you go along All right... Whoa, whoa, hold on! Looks like there is a penalty called Fictional character on the field, Lear is disqualified All right, Lining up now is that father-son team of Henry IV and Prince Hal Center snaps to the quarterback. Quarterback gives to the hunchback It looks like that limp is giving Richard III trouble again - A horse, a horse! My kingdom for a horse! - There‚Äôs a pile-up on the field Fumble!!! And Henry VIII comes up with it. He‚Äôs headed to the goaline He stops at the 5 to chop off his wife‚Äôs head Who‚Äôs your daddy? Touchdown for the Red Rose! Oh my! You gotta believe this is the beginning of a Tudor dynasty! Henry V, Richard III. Fellows are dark, and trousers, dirty Go Fergie! Can I just... can I borrow your program? I'll give it right back, I promise - I just wanne check the list of plays - What are you doing? I just wanna look at the list of plays 'Cause I think we might've don'em all already - Really? - Sure, because we just did all the histories, right? Yeah, and we did all the comedies all together Oh good, that just leaves the tragedies Um, Titus Andronicus I did with all the blood Romeo and Juliet, Julius Caesar, Troilus and Cressida - Othello was a rap, King Lear was in the football game - Maybe we will let you guys out early tonight Um, Macbeth, the Scottish play! Yeah! - Wait, wait. Antony and Cleopatra? - We did it! We did it totally! I threw up on that guy in the hat! Right, that's right! Timon of Athens I mentioned - Coriolanus? - Oh, just... let's just skip it! Why? What... What's the matter with Coriolanus? I don't like the "anus" part. I just think... No, I think it's offensive. We have some young children It's not a clever word... (I'm 13)... I don't care if you're 20! I don't wanna hear you using language like that, young man! Is this your mommy? Don't give me the evil eye! Now I know why some animals eat their young. You know, I swear to God I think that kid could kick your ass, so just leave him alone But I think you are right, we are all... No, no, no, NO! Look here! Oh no! Hamlet! How... how did we forget Hamlet? Shakespeare didn't write Hamlet, did he? - Yes, he did! - Of course he did! He didn't! It's a Mel Gibson movie! It's based on the play, anyway... Well, 36 down, just 1 to go. Perhaps the Bard's greatest play, a play of... I'm sorry, I really don't feel up for it tonight I don't... I don't... Hamlet is a very big play, it's got a lot of words, it's got, you know, like ideas and stuff But don't quit, man! It's just that football game left me really emotionally and phisically drained I just, you know, I don't think I could do justice to it! We don't have to do justice to it! I mean, where have you been? We just have to do it, you know! - The kid... - Don't worry about the kid! The play is called "The Complete Works of William Shakespeare" Well, let's just change the name of the play then... We call: "The Complete Works of Shakespeare... Except Hamlet" That's ridiculous! I think they will like to see Hamlet, won't you? This is... this is... no... Okay... look, okay... I you want to do it so bad, you two do it, and I'll watch What? That doesn't make any sense! Oh, shoe... look at this shoe! No, no, no, no.... I've never seen inside it before... - What? Is it a crime to take somebody's bag? - Yes! Oh, everything I do is wrong! - What is the matter with you? - Why don't you take away my birthday? - What? - It just sucks! This show sucks! All right! Are you relaxed? We are going to do Hamlet, all right? Okay, all right! So we will start with the Battle... Oh, shit! I'm sorry! Yeah, so there is Bernardo and Horatio I think it's very sensible for you to carry those by the way I'll kill the cameraman, I'll kill him I don't care, we've got 5 other cameramen, I don't care Austin is usually a lot faster than Adam I'm sure they will be back in just a minute Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! Tell you what... let's take an intermission here Um, go out to the lobby, stretch your legs, have a few drinks We're always much more talented after you had a few drinks I'll need you back here in 15 minutes Austin and Adam should be back by then And we will proceed with Hamlet, Prince of Denmark I hope... Please, don't patronize me! Austin and Adam aren't back yet! Well, actually, Austin called in the intermission He said he caught Adam at the airport trying to catch a flight to Rio And, um, he suggested that, until they get back, I go ahead, and cover the sonnets Shakespeare wrote 154 sonnets I've reduced the meltdown onto this card And, um, what I was thinking we could do is pass it among the audience Like, um, say we start here with you ma'am, right? I give you the card, you take it, read it, enjoy it, passes to the person next to you Yeah, yeah, you! Yeah, and then down on the row like that, and then, if you just pass it behind you And then just back and forth, and back and forth, and back and forth, and back... And forth, and back and forth, and back and forth, and back And, by the time it gets to you, Austin and Adam should be here So, um, Bob, if we can have some house lights, please As I say, ma'am, why don't we start here with you Just take it, read it, enjoy it, pass it along Austin and Adam, ladies and gentlemen This is so uncool, you grabbed me You gave me a carpet burn on my arm You should've come here earlier I don't wanna do this! - You alright? You alright? - C'mon! C'mon! Here, here, blow, blow alright? Just take him back stage I'll start here, okay? Bob, um, can I get some mood lighting, please? To, um, to help me sort of set the scene For what is perhaps the greatest play ever written in the English language Hamlet, the tragedy of the prince of Denmark The place... Denmark! The time... a very long time ago! The battlements of Elsinore castle. Round about midnight. Two guards enter (Adam!) I don't wanna do this stupid play, leave me alone! - Get off! - Don't make me... I told you! - Who‚Äôs there? - Nay, answer me. Stand and unfold yourself - Long live the king - Bernardo! (He!) ‚ÄòTis now struck twelve Get thee to bed, Horatio - For this relief, much thanks - Well, good night Peace, break thee off Look where it comes! - Mark it, Horatio. It would be spoke to - What art thou? By heaven, I charge thee, speak! 'Tis gone! It was about to speak when the sock crew Break we our watch up! And by my advice, let us impart what we have seen tonight unto Hamlet, prince of Denmark! O that this too, too solid flesh would melt Thaw, and resolve itself into a dew That is should come to this, but two months dead So loving to my mother Frailty, thy name is woman! Yeah, you! Married to mine uncle, my father‚Äôs brother The funeral baked meats did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables - My lord! - Horatio! - Methinks I see my father - Where, my lord? - In my mind‚Äôs eye, Horatio - My lord, I think I saw him yesternight - Saw who? - The king, your father! - The king, my father? But where was this? - Upon the platform where we watched ‚ÄòTis very strange I will watch tonight Perchance ‚Äòtwill walk again All is not well, Horatio. Would the night were come So... O the wind bites shrewdly. It is very cold! Look, my lord, it comes! Angels and ministers of grace defend us Something is rotten in the state of Denmark Mark me! Speak. I am bound to hear! So art thou to revenge when thou shalt hear If ever thou didst thy dear father love Revenge his foul and most unnatural murderer - Murderer! - Murderer! The serpent that did sting thy father‚Äôs life now wears his crown - My uncle! - His uncle! Let not the royal bed of Denmark become a couch for incest - Incest! - A couch! Adieu, Hamlet, adieu! Remember me! - My lord, this is strange! There are more things in Heaven and Earth, Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy So piss off! I hereafter shall think meet to put an antic disposition on The time is out of joint. O cursed spite that ever I was born to exit right Neither a borrower nor a lender be! How now, Ophelia. What‚Äôs the matter? My lord, as I was sewing in my closet, lord Hamlet, with no hat upon his head, pale as his shirt His knees knocking together, and with a look So piteous in purport as if he had been loosed Out of hell to speak of horrors, he comes before me I'd keep that dress if I were you! - Mad for thy love? O my Lord, I know not! Why, this is the very ecstasy of love. I have found the cause of Hamlet‚Äôs lunacy Since brevity is the soul of wit, I will be brief: he is mad How does my good lord Hamlet? - Well, God mercy! - Do you know me, my lord? - Excellent well. You are a fishmonger - What do you read, my lord? - Word, words, words - Though this be madness, yet there‚Äôs method in‚Äôt Daddy, the players are here, and they said they wanna do a play-within-a-play So you'd better come see what they want because they won't talk... I am but mad north-northwest When the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a hawk from a handsaw I don't know... I‚Äôll have these players play something like the murder of my father before mine uncle I‚Äôll observe his looks. If he do but blench, I will know my course The play‚Äôs the thing wherein I‚Äôll catch the conscience of the king! Shut up, please! Shut up! What part of "shut up!" don't you understand? To be... Austin, Austin, you can... turn on the lights for a second! Did you do the "to be or not to be" speech? Of course I didn't! They are laughing at me! - They are not laughing at you! - They were laughing with you! No, no! That guy right there! It was that guy right there! Calm down, man! He's on drugs or something... - (...) speech! - I know, I know, it's a, it's, it's... I'm sorry about this, everybody! I think Austin is really... You know, he takes this very seriously! I think emotionally it's maybe too much for him tonight I think we'll just skip the "to be or not to be" speech I'm sorry if anybody feels... - Well, that's... - You shoulda thought about that before you laughed at him This is the risk you take at live theatre Anything can happen, okay? You know, like, if this was "Miss Saigon", Maybe the helicopter wouldn't come in It's an overrated speech anyway, Hamlet is supposed to be thinking about killing his uncle And, instead, Shakespeare is like "I'm contemplating suicide", you know? We think it just weakens the character It just makes some wishy washy Right, so we'll skip to the play-within-a-play scene Yeah, pergfect, okay, yeah! What we'll do is skip to the play-within-a-play scene You guys do the setting I'll give Austin... Whoa, and the nunnery speech of Hamlet? Whoa, that piece of work speech, I think we should just cut it I don't know, it's kind of important! Okay, there is just this one speech that comes before the play-within-a-play scene That just goes: "I have of late, but wherefore I know not Lost all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercise, and indeed it goes so heavily with my disposition That this goodly frame, the Earth, seems to me a sterile promontory This most excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave o‚Äôerhanging firmament This majestic roof fretted with golden fire Why it appears to me no other than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapors What a piece of work is man; how noble in reason, how infinite in faculty In form and moving how express and admirable In action how like an angel In apprehension how like a god The beauty of the world, the paragon of animals Yet to me, what is this quintessence of dust? Man delights not me? Right, so we'll cut that speech, and go right to the killer Guys, what about the "get thee to a nunnery" scene? Let's just skip that one Because "get thee to a nunnery" scene is an Ophelia scene, man! And Ophelia is a dificult and complex character No, no, she's not. No, it's, Ophelia is you in a wig, you know? Anybody can play Ophelia, My mother could play Ophelia That lady right there could play Ophelia - Well, let's get her! - No, no... Thank you so much! We are going to perform... No, no, no, wait. Whatcha doin'? Getting that impostor out of here! She's not an imposter! You can't just throw her back, you know? - I'll do it! - It's too late! You got her up here, she's wearing this nice wig, it's gonna be fine! (It's my scene!) It's my scene! What am I supposed to do? I'm... I'm like... Just watch and learn, you know? I'm watching? I'm learning? Is this what I'm supposed to do? - You had your chance! - You come back, take that mic off! - No, no! - This is stupid! No, it will be fine! It will be great! Just watch! You're just gonna do the scene with your new friend, and I'm supposed to... - You had your chance! - We are gonna show you how simple it is, alright? That's fine, I don't care! I think the show sucks anyway! Oh, c'mon! It's not that big of a... Thanks for breaking up the group, Yoko! Bullshit! I'm very sorry about that! Listen, thank you very much for helping us out! - I'm sorry, what's your name? - Tiffany! - Tiffany? - Tiffany! That's, um, do you mind if we call you Bob? That's just easier for us to remember Um, anyway, um, the scene between Ophelia and Hamlet - It's a very simple scene! - It's not a simple scene! If you're gonna humiliate her, be honest with her! We are not gonna humiliate her! We are not humiliating anybody, you calm down! You calm down! (You calm down!) You calm down, man! You know, I'll, I'll hit you so hard, I'll kill your whole family, man! You take your medicine! Okay! - Uhhhh, get her! - Okay! A little bit of background: Hamlet and Ophelia have had this relationship together in the past Yeah, among everything that is going on with his mother, and is uncle, and his father, and... He doesn't wanna deal with her anymore, alright? He gets all worked up, and he tells her to get out of his life! He says to her: "get thee to a nunnery!" Alright, now, in our version of the scene, all that Ophelia does in response is: she screams! - That's not all she does! - It's all she does! - There is more to it than that! - No, there is not! Hamlet says "get thee to a nunnery!", Ophelia screams, okay? So, let's try that, alright? And I'll give you a cue, alright? - Hey, good luck! - Hay, Adam! I didn't touch her, she hit me with the shoulder! - Oh, c'mon! - She started it, man! She's provoking me since she came in here, that's all I'm saying! - Sit down! - Okay, screw over, kid! Okay, now are you all set? Alright, I'll give it to you, I'll, I'm sorry, let me... Let me just step into the character here! Get thee to a nunnery! No, please, shut up, ladies and gentlemen! - Hey, hey, I thought that was good! - Yeah, it was pretty good! No, it sucked, man! Even the frame setting sucked! I'm sorry I shout at you, I felt threatened 'cause they brought you up here to do my part, you are not an actress! - Maybe - You think so? (Maybe) I think not! No, she showed a lot of heart, a lot of courage - as Shakespeare would say, chutzpah. No, I think there was something lacking There was no inner life to the character You know, there is little depth... No, I know what you mean, that's actually very good note - 'Cause, Bob, actors use what they call subtext - Yes, or inner module Exactly, inner module, that's something you didn't have And that's why your performance was just flat No, but I think she showed promise, and I don't think we should let this go I think this is like riding a bicycle, you fall off, you get on a horse, you just keep going, man! In fact I think we should get everybody involved here for just a few seconds to workshop this, you know? Like, um, bring up the house lights I think everybody should act on what is inside, the feels in his head for Bob Help her understand the character like, like... If we divide everybody into Ophelia's Ego and Superego! Oh, yeah, yeah, like it's a Freudian analysis With an union undertone (yes, yes!) An Ego! We need an Ego! Let's get an Ego out there! So, this gentleman is gonna represent your Ego! Oh, this guy can play an Ego! Very powerful lumberjack-like Ego! At this point of the play, her Ego has become frightened, it's flighty, it's an Ego on the run To symbolize the Ego on the run, why don't we have Bob here, I'm sorry, mind if I call you Bob? Why don't we have Bob here symbolize the Ego on the run by running back and forth across the stage? Yes, yes, just go... Such an energy! We have an Egomaniac here! Okay, now, if you just hear her subconscious Why don't we have everyone on the forth here in this folding chairs Represent Ophelia's head for us Now, at this point of the play, her id is confused, is wishy washy It's a wash in a sea of alternatives Oh, that was very... (Thank you, thank you very much!) So, to represent this confused id, why don't we have everybody on these folding chair put both hands up your heads like this And we are gonna say this, we are gonna say: "maybe, maybe not" "Maybe, maybe not", "maybe, maybe not" "maybe, maybe not", (okay, good!) Save it for later, okay! Alright, you! third line, what's your problem? Everybody is doing a great "maybe, maybe not", "maybe, maybe not" He is like this Does not play well with other children! You know what that means, don't you, Bob? That means that you'll have to do it all by yourself C'mon, man! Get'em up! Get'em up! Great! And don't worry about a thing, man! 'Cause nobody is looking, alright? Okay, okay, let's hear him: "maybe, maybe not" I feel a lot of love in this room I don't know, maybe it's just the.. okay So we got the id, we got the Ego, we got a single misfiring greencell right here It's great to know, why don't we get everybody behind the seats to be the Superego? This is the final psychological componenet, the Superego It's like all the struggling voices within your head telling you what to do Very powerful voices that are very difficult to shake Some people never shake them in the whole lifetime, you know? So, like Catholicism or something So why don't we, why don't we divide the Superego into three parts to symbolize the complexity So if we get everyone from where Reed is indicating to my left to be Section A of the Superego Everybody from Reed to where Austin is indicating to be Section B of the Superego And everybody from Austin to my right, you're Section C Yeah, it's not that difficult, is it? You got the idea! Now, Section A, you're the masculine voice in Ophelia pyche, alright? You're like the voice of all men in her life that have been bossing her around And, um, we'll use Hamlet's line for this I'd like all of you to say "get thee to a nunnery!" Let's give it a try, Section A: "Get thee to a nunnery!" Section A, that was awful! Please, people, work with me on this, we wanna make it very loud, very powerful, very stiking, Section A: "Get thee to a nunnery!" Oh, yeah, that was much less totally pathetic! Okay, now Section B, you're the voice of Ophelia's libido, okay? So, this is the part of the psiche that wants to be attracted to Hamlet You're saying, "look, do something wth yourself", "for God sake, put some makeup or something!" Just, no offense... This is straight out of Shakesperian text, okay? I'd like all of you to say, "Paint an inch thick!" "Paint an inch thick!" I think Section A could learn something from Section B Possibly, they're small, but they're plaque Now finally, Section C, we saved you for last because I think waht we'll do is use Section C To draw this into a modern context because we wanna make Ophelia relevant to women of today Maybe she wants power, but she doesn't wanna lose her femininity She wanna be Corporate Executive, but, you know, she wants babies at the same time She is tired of being pushed around by Hamlet, and she wants to assure herself she feels like saying, ‚ÄúLook, cut the crap, Hamlet, my biological clock is ticking and I want babies now!" Whoa, whoa, wait, you know what... Yeah, we'll have you say, "cut the crap, Hamlet, my biological clock is ticking and I want babies now!" Yeah, your mommy will explain it later, kid! Biology class So, let's give it a try, Section C: "Cut the crap, Hamlet, my biological clock is ticking and I want babies now!" Alright, everybody, what I think we should do now is We'll get all the psychological elements into play simultaneously, right? id, Ego, Superego, biological clock, and the voices "maybe, maybe not!" And your job as an actress, Bob, is to take all of this energy in Synthesize it within your soul, right? And, at that moment of truth, we'll build everyone into a might frenzy, then stop everything, all attention is to you And you let out with that scream that epitomizes Ophelia No problem! - Well, we'll see! - Oh, she can't wait! Everybody, let's all, okay, focus, please! Alright, everyone? Let's all take a deep breath together! Yeah, let it out, kid He's turning grace, keep an eye on him! Right, you stand back here! Right (perfect!), yeah, right there! Excellent! And remember, no matter what happens, act natural! - Starting with the Ego! - The starting line here, Bob! Alright, here we go! Okay, and... On your marks! Like a Colts you are, huh? We are not gonna have to check you for steroids after this, are we? I recognize you, you were on the East Germany women's track team His name was Helga, I swear to God! Glad to see they finally dropped, alright! You know what I mean, alright! Alright? On your mark, set, go! "Maybe, maybe not" Section A Section B C Stop! It's just that you are beautiful, and erotic, and sensual! I think we really shared something, didn't we? But back to Hamlet, Act III, Scene II, the famous ‚Äúplay-within-a-play scene‚Äù In which Hamlet discovers conclusive evidence that his uncle murdered his father ‚ÄúSpeak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, and hold, as ‚Äòtwere, the mirror up to nature - Will my lord hear this piece of work? - Aye, and the king, too, presently And now, how does my cousin Hamlet, and my son? A little more than kin, and less than kind I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words are not mine - My lord, have a seat - Alright, I'll seat here Screw over, kid! I'm doing ya' Hey, good show, huh? My lord, the Royal Theatre of Denmark is proud to present "The Murder of Gonzago" Bravo, bravo, yeah, uhu! Oh, it's a puppet show! I love it! I love it! My lord, Act I Hubba hubba Hey, hey, no, no, no. Hey, hey! Oh, the wheels on the bus go round and round.... Okay, I'm sorry... I didn't... - How likes my lord the play? - The lady doth protest too much, methinks! Haha, whoa, she protests too much, get it? Get it? Get it? Whoa. She doesn't get it. That's okay! (I'll explain it later) My lord, Act II Gesundheit! I‚Äôll take the ghost‚Äôs word for a thousand pound! My lord, the queen would speak with you in her closet - Then will I come to my mother - Behind the arras I‚Äôll convey myself to hear the process - Now, mother, what‚Äôs the matter? - Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended - Mother, you have my father much offended - What wilt thou do? Thou wilt not murder me? Help! Help! Help! How now? A rat! Nooooo... noooooo... It will hurt... I told you so... Dead for a ducat, aww - Where's Polonius? - At supper! - At supper? Where? - Not where he eats, but where he is eaten - O no, it‚Äôs Laertes! - Son of Polonius - Brother to Ophelia! - And a snappy dresser! Why, thanks. O, thou vile king! Give me my father! How came he dead? I‚Äôll be revenged for Polonius‚Äôs murder! How now, what noise is this? Dear maid, kind sister, sweet, Ophelia! I'm mad! I'm out of my tiny little mind! I'm screwy-louie, I'm... See, this is acting! Here‚Äôs rue for you, here is rosemary for remembrance and I would have given you violets, but they withered all when my father died I‚Äôm starting to feel a little nauseous here I'm about to die! Hamlet comes back. What would I undertake to show myself, my father's son, in deed... Wait, hold on, Reed, before you go on to the next scene with Ophelia There's no more scenes with Ophelia - C'mon, I'm up for it! - No, that's all Shakespeare wrote! - What happens to her? - She drowns! - Okay, cool! - Okay! To cut his throat in the church; I'll do that, and I'll anoint my sword... I‚Äôll anoint my sword with an unction so mortal that where it draws blood No cataplasm can save the thing from this compulsion I don't know what it means either! This skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once but then came the Nutrisystem Weight Loss Program! Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him! But soft! Here comes the queen! Couch me awhile, and mark! Lay her in the earth; and from her fair and unpolluted flesh, may violets spring Sweets to the sweet Ophelia. Farewell! Hold off the earth awhile, ‚Äòtill I have caught her once more in mine arms What is he worse grief bears such an emphasis? Haya! This is I, Hamlet the great Dane! I will fight with him until my eyelids no longer wag The cat will mew, and the dog will have his day. Come! Give us the foils! - Come, one for me! - Now be careful. Those are sharp! - Come, sir! - Come, my lord! Look! Amelia Earhart! - Where? - There! One! (No!) Judgement? A hit, a hit; a very palpable hit! Yeah, Hamlet, drink off this cup! - Nay! - Yeah, Hamlet, drink off this cup! Nay, set it by awhile, mother! Father, uncle, whatever the hell you are... Come again, Laertes! - Another hit, what say you? - A touch, a touch, I do confess! - O take this! (No!) - The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet - Madam, do not drink! - I will, my lord. I pray you pardon me It is the poisoned cup! It is too late! Come again, Laertes! For the third! - How fair is the Queen? - She swoons to see thee bleed No. The drink! The drink! I am poisoned! O villainy! Treachery! Seek it out! It is here, Hamlet. Here I lie, never to rise again I can no more. The king. The king‚Äôs to blame What? The point envenom'd too? Then, venom, to thy work! Here, thou murd'rous, incestuous... cross-dressing Dane: Follow my mother! Forgive me, Hamlet. I am justly killed by mine own treachery Heaven make thee free of it... I follow thee! You that look pale, or tremble at this chance That are but mutes, or audience to this act If ever thou did‚Äôst hold me in thy hearts Absent thee from felicity awhile And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain To tell my story... The rest is silence! Ladies and gentlemen, we shall have an encore! Okay, thank you! We got about 3 more minutes so we are gonna go through Hamlet one more time very quickly for you I just need to make one quick announcement because we have a few children here tonight As we go through this, we are gonna be moving very fast this time Now, there's a lot of sharp swords that we use, there's falls that we take There's props that we send flying back and forth, we make it look easy But it's actually very difficult and very dangerous, so... As you watch us do it, please, keep in mind that the 3 of us are trained professionals, okay? Do not try this at home! Right, kid? Yeah, go over to a friend's house, it's much safer... - O that this too too solid flesh would melt - My lord, I think I saw your father yesternight - Would the night were come - Mark me! - Something is rotten in the state of Denmark - Revenge my murder My lord, this is strange Well, there are more things in heaven and earth, so piss off To be or not to be, that is the question...
