Then next time, you're stayin' home. Look, I don't wanna hear it, okay ? You can't always do the things I wanna do. Ya know ? All yappin' and yellin'-- just keep quiet, okay ? I'm making sure you stay home the next time. Oh, man. Gee whiz. [ Knocking on door ] Hey, man, come on ! [ Clicks ] [ Snoring ] I know you're awake and listening. Come on, up and at 'em. [ Snoring continues ] Look, man, I'm no happier about this than you are. Spending two weeks with your boojie aunt and uncle in their summer place... Don't exactly have me doin' the boogaloo either. But... We got to go, and that is that. [ Snoring continues ] Well, let's see. Hey, man, you know, maybe it won't be that bad. You get to see your cousin for the first time in years. The house is on the beach. [ Snoring continues ] Hmm. Maybe we could spend that time together. Oh ! Unh ! Big guy ! Hey, man, where you-- I can't trust you for a minute ! [ Snoring continues ] What is going on in here ? Where you been ? Out getting some fresh air. You're gonna get nothin' but fresh air for 14 days. And this thing-- [ snoring continues ] That stays home. [ Clattering ] Why are we taking this raggedy old piece of shit ? Because it's his bike and he'll want it, that's why. And because you're making him leave his little friend. What friend ? It's a doll, Brenda. Now, let's call it what it is. A 16-year-old boy that's still playing with a damn doll. Oh, just be quiet. Would you g-- Ohh, it's gonna be a long drive. * let's keep on groovin' the way we do * * let's just keep on movin' * and we're gonna make it through, hah * * huggin' and a-lovin' * huggin' and a-lovin' * gettin' with the kissin' * * gettin' with the kissin' * gettin' with the kissin' * * gettin' with the kissin' * huggin' and a-lovin' * huggin' and a-lovin' * huggin' and a-lovin' gettin' with the kissin'* * ow, yeah * gettin' with the kissin' huggin' and a-lovin' * * hm, hey * feel like a kid whenever you're near * * stickin' like glue I keep a-lovin' you * * on and on * on and on * huh, keep on movin' * on and on * we gotta move we gotta groove * * keep on movin' on and on * * on and on * wow, we gotta move * on and on * on and on * keep on movin' * on and on * hey, hey, hey, hey - wake up, baby.

[ Chuckles ] You still workin' with that social program ? What are ya, a social worker, somethin' like that ? Yeah ? Somethin' like that. Oh. I'd almost forgot what a great place this was. How long has it been ? Five years ? Mm-hmm, and it's your own fault, Brenda. You wouldn't even be here now if-- if your house hadn't almost burned down. Come on, girl. There's my baby. Hi, mama. Come and give mama some sugar. Not you. My little baby. [ Chuckling ] Hi, grandma. So, you finally decided to come see your mother... Before she up and died on ya, huh ? Hello, mama. You're lookin' good. Thank you, Brenda. [ Laughing ] [ Drew laughing ] [ Kissing ] Drew, take your bags up to junior's room. It's the first one that you come to. Okay. You're looking fat. Where's the black panther ? Unloading the car. And please, mama, don't call him the black panther. His name is Kenny. Oh, w-- oh, just stinking drawers. [ Sighs ] What're we doin' here ? Fourteen days ? Fourteen long, boring, dull days... In this... filthy... Stinking... Nasty, old, yucky place. Ohh. Son of a bitch ! Who else could that be but drew Tate ? - What it is, cuz ! - Hey, junior. Long time no see... As in chicken of the sea. [ Laughs ] The chick-- of-- ho, damn, what time is it ? You guys must've drove all night. Hey, and speakin' of nights, what a night I had last night. Four parties, and I went to every last one of 'em. Biddies all over me like mosquitoes. Had to beat 'em off me, drew. So, how you doin' ? Still a virgin ? [ Laughs ] I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding, okay ? How you doin' ? Believe me, you don't wanna know. Well, let me be the first to welcome you to the vineyard, drew. Now, if you're lucky, I might let ya hang out with me. Just kiddin', drew. I'm kiddin', all right ? Now, look, I just can't believe that you're finally here, man. Now I got somebody else to hang out with. Maybe I'll let you... Hang out with the beautiful man there. [ Kisses ] I'm about to get some breakfast. I'm starved. Want something to eat ? Naw, I'm fine. Yeah, I'm fine. Sure ? Hey ! J-u-n-i-o-r. Hey. Hey, how ya doin', aunt Brenda ? Wh-where's uncle Kenny ? Downstairs. I'll go say hi to him. All right. We're goin' to the beach, sweetie. You better put on your trunks. Uh, I'll pass. Come on. I hate the beach. What do you mean ? You ain't ever been to the beach. And now you know why. Sweetheart. I know how you are about strange places, but... this'll be good for you. Maybe later, okay ? You guys go. Go, go, go. Okay. Mm, we'll come back for ya. And it will be fun. [ Door closes ] Right. Fun. Oh, sand all in the crack of your butt. Can't wait. [ Exhales ] * who knows * how I feel * who know-whoa-whoas * how I feeeeel [ sighs ] [ Sea gulls squawking in distance ] [ Squawking continues ] [ Panting ] Ooh. Wa-wait. Wait. Iago. Iago ! Wait 'til you see this ! [ Chuckling ] Yes, yes, yes ! Little buddy, you will not believe... What I just saw ! Whoa ! Calm down. No, no, no, no, no, no. Aw. [ Exhales ] Hey, sorry, little buddy. We're gonna have to keep you in the bag... Before I can put you back on the saddle. Hey ! I know it's stuffy in there. I'm sure you can hold your breath. Drew ! Hey, drew ! Hey, man. Didn't you hear me calling you, man ? No. Your folks got me lookin' all over for you, man. Where you been ? Oh, I just been out, you know, lookin' around and stuff. - Have you been to the beach ? - Mm-mm. Then what you waitin' for ? Come on. Is it all right if I take my bike ? Sure, if you wanna catch somebody's grandmother. [ Laughing ] Well, feast your eyes, cuz, 'cause you ain't seen nothin' like you're about to see. Welcome to the inkwell, drew. Can you dig it ? [ Drew ] Wow. See, black folks started comin' here around the turn of the century. He's right. And before that, it was all white. Well, needless to say. After we, uh, discovered it, the white folks started moving to the beaches up-island. Needless to say. Mm-hmm. Bougie niggers. As far as the eye can see. God, downright scary, if you ask me. Spencer, he's kidding. Oh, I know. I know that. I mean, after all, isn't this what your struggle was all about, hmm ? Huey and Bobby, Angela, hmm ? It's what I always wanted. My own black beach. Uh, the point is... That this beach, our own little part of the island, is the result of economic struggle. Yes, blacks who have made it-- [ Grunts ] Who have attained the American dream. [ Laughing ] And what about the black folks who weren't allowed to make it ? Where's their inkwell ? Coney island ? [ Francis laughing ] Oh, Spence. Where do they go ? You are a mess. Come on. [ Laughing ] Stop it. [ Spencer and Francis laughing ] See, cuz, you also gotta learn the scuba-do. See, that's where you scope a honey in the water in a bikini, dive underwater, pretend like you don't know where you're goin', pull her suit down, bush everywhere. But what about all those sharks and stuff ? Aw, come on, drew, don't start with that jaws shit, man. When that flick first opened up downtown... And my man chopped that white girl's ass up, black folks wouldn't go in the water for days, like that shit was real or something. - Well, did you go in ? - Hell, no ! I ain't goin' ! You think I'm crazy ? Shoot. Ah, see over there ? Hi, junior ! That's Michelle and sheena. See there in the back ? That's Darlene. Oh, yeah. Darlene. Get her under the pier, you are the Mac daddy, drew. Oh, no. I'll introduce you to everybody tonight, man. Get your stroll down, drew. Mmm-mmm. [ Sighs ] [ Exhales ] So he's, uh, okay, isn't he ? Spence. We said we wouldn't bring that up, at least before they did. What ? We're all family here, aren't we ? I'm just trying to show a little concern here. Is who okay ? Drew. Yeah, you know. The fire thing, huh ? Well, Francis told me that, uh-- Spence. Well, Brenda, I know you told me not to tell how the fire got started, - but he's my husband. - So ? All right, now, the way I hear it, those arson investigators, they discovered what ? Lighter fluid residue, all over the-- those lips of yours just never stop flappin', do they ? Well, you know how your sister is. Oh, now, come on. Huh ? Don't misunderstand. We like drew. We're just tryin' to help, that's all. Look, Spence is right. We have a friend here on the island, a psychiatrist-- no. Well, she specializes in children... With emotional problems. Oh, well, I'm not tryin' to say that drew has any problems, but it wouldn't hurt for her to talk to him. Drew don't need to see no shrink. Oh, don't worry about the cost, hmm ? I told you, she's a friend. My son is not crazy ! [ Drew laughing ] Hey, everybody. Hi, folks. Like my seashells ? You know, see-shells ? [ Laughs ] Get it ? My see-shells ? Show you my see-shells ? I don't need glasses. [ Laughing ] - [ Whistles ] - [ Junior laughing ] He's all right with me. Where is my good-luck, get-laid shirt ? Drew, what do you think of this shirt ? Mm-mm. Yeah, me too. It look like some Don ho stuff, huh ? I ain't goin' to no luau. Why don't you get yourself ready, man ? You know they'll be here soon. Uh, junior, I was thinkin' about it. I don't know if I'm gonna go. What do you mean you're not gonna go ? Come on, drew, don't pull that shy stuff on me. My mom said to make sure you have a good time, and, damn it, you're gonna have a good time. Okay, okay. Now, where's your stuff ? What stuff ? Your party jams. Come on. Oh, yeah. I'm wearin' 'em. [ Clears throat ] [ Laughs ] You're kiddin', right ? No, what ? Drew, you're not goin' nowhere with me lookin' like that. Why not ? These are corduroys, drew. Man, they make noise when you walk ! [ Imitating noise ] You could start a fire ! Now, I got something for you, all right ? Make me have to bring my fire extinguisher. Whew. Now, look, Spencer. Listen to me. Look, um-- Malcolm X told white america like it is. [ Groans ] [ Exhales ] Malcolm little... Was a demagogue, a charlatan, hmm ? He was shot by his own people, for god's sake. So was j.F.K. Oh, Malcolm had no... Broad-base support, and, in fact, had made a lot of negro enemies. And I suppose reverend king didn't make any negro enemies. Martin Luther King is another subject entirely ! And besides, his assassin was white and confessed. And Malcolm's assassins were black. So what ? What assassins ? He was a common Harlem hoodlum... Killed by common Harlem hoodlums. And you're full of shit. Oh ! Are you getting mad ? Well, look, I am sorry if I have injured your black pride, huh ? I mean, you being an ex-black-panther and all. Oh ! [ Laughing ] Yeah, that's right. You injured my pride. Mm-hmm. Because my blackness, my history, is important to me. Something I think you forgot on your climb up honky's ladder. Oh, he's getting mad. Yeah, he's getting mad. Hey ! Everybody ! Everybody come see the black panther get mad ! Hey ! Ya don't wanna miss this ! [ Laughing ] You will kiss my black ass, motherfucker. [ Spencer ] Ohh. Whew, Kenny. Ya see, ya take all this too seriously, Kenny. Ya know what ? You're right. I mean, what a fucked-up thing that is... To care about your own people. [ Laughing ] Common Harlem hoodlums. There he goes ! The l-- Kenny ! The last of the revolutionaries ! Spencer, you've had enough. There he goes ! Spencer, stop it, damn it ! That's my sister ! They're our guests ! Well, he needs to grow up. This is america. Love it... Or leave it. Kenny ! What's this all about ? Brother-in-law's a jive uncle Tom, how's that ? He thinks you're a jive black militant. So what ? He thinks, or you think ? I'm sorry I forced you to come. I thought it might be good for both US and drew. If I had known this would've happened, I never would've pushed. What's the problem ? We are all family. Ain't that what uncle Remus said ? This is my family. I am your family, and I didn't wanna come ! You should've stayed the hell at home ! Drew and I would have come alone. Shit, he didn't want to come either ! 'Cause of what you told him, like you've ever been here ! No, I didn't have to be here before. I know your family and heard enough about this island of bourgeois jungle bunnies. From who ? Those tired parolees you call friends ? I know what this is about, Mr. Kenny Tate. It's about a 16-year-old boy you don't know how to talk to... And a dashiki you're afraid to take off. Thank you. I'm not chasin' you, Kenny. Kenny ! Kenny ! Kenny ! Kenny ! [ Laughter ] [ Horn honking ] Junior ! Come on out, daddy ! Junior ! [ Laughing ] Goin' down ! [ Honks horn ] Goin' down to the party !

Damn, who's wearin' brut ? Oh, you know that's gotta be Darryl. Aw, man, keep the top down. Hurry up and drive before I go back up to see your girl. [ All laughing ] Yours up there too ! [ Laughing, whooping ] Girl, I got a sweet tooth for your love. Girl, if I had some bread, I'd sop you up. [ Laughing ] Sop her up ! Sop me ! If I told you you had a beautiful body, would you hold it against me ? Y'all wanna park, or should we go on in ? No, I say we hit the dance floor, 'cause I can hear the girls calling junior right now. Hey, now ! Hey, now ! [ Laughing ] Can you dig it ? [ Crowd cheering ] Yeah !

[ Laughing ] [ Phone ringing ] Are you and that black panther having problems ? We have the same problems as every other family, mama. - Oh, I see. - That's all it is. [ Spencer softly ] Ohh.

Get out of my kitchen ! Out ! [ Belches ] [ Clocks ticking ] So, um... Andrew, what do you think ? - About what ? - The island. She's talkin' about the island. Oh, we just got here. I don't know what to think. Well, um, how about a first impression ? It's a big pile of dirt and some salty water. Well, i-- I guess that is one way to look at it. I bet you miss your friends. Huh. He ain't got no friends. Is that true ? No, not exactly. I-- I do have one friend. Here we go. Only one friend ? Well, how many am I supposed to have ? Doctor, there are a number of issues we'd like to address; like not talking, at least not to US. And who is he talking to ? His damn self. Mr. Tate, talking to one's self is not necessarily... An indicator that there is a problem. A boy his age is supposed to be out playin' ball or datin' or raisin' hell. My boy is quotin' dead white people ! [ Brenda ] You would rather he were more like you when you were 16 ? A hoodlum in training ? [ Dr. Wade ] Mrs. Tate. Hoodlum ? [ Brenda ] Would you like me to spell that ? Mr. and Mrs. Tate. [ Clocks chiming, cuckooing ] Jesus Christ. Well, I guess the hour's up, huh ? I'm so sorry. Thank you, anyway, doctor. How much do we owe you ? This one's on me. Drew. Drew ? Give the island a chance. I think you'll find it's a lot more than rocks and salty water. Drew ? Drop by anytime. My door's always open. Woman's got too much damn time on her hands. [ Car door opens, closes ] I am really sorry, sweetheart. See you back at the house ? Yeah. Bye. I hope you're satisfied. Just drive. [ Engine starts ] Bye. Oh, quit yappin'.

Come on, you're not even swingin' ! All right, all right. Are you gonna play ? Are you gonna play, Heather ? Yes. Get ready. Are you ready ? Are you ready ? Let's play, then. Let's go ! Okay. Losers pay for dinner. Let's go. Oh, oh, oh ! You-- you okay ? Yeah. "The beauty of chivalry. A thousand lights shine happily." Thanks. Honey, honey. Are you okay ? Yeah, I'm okay. Thanks. Let's finish this game. You're welcome. [ Heather ] Come on, let's play. Mmm. Drew. Drew ! Oh. Oh, hey, junior. "The beauty of chivalry" ? What is that shit ? Somethin' I read somewhere. You need to stop readin', talkin' that crap. Let's get up outta here, man. Huh ! [ Girls laughing ] You know, me and the boys were thinkin' who we could fix you up with. We figured geechee Gail would be a good choice for you, man. Naw, I think I'll pass. Uh-oh, drew, I think we got a nippie sighting. Oh ! [ Laughing ] Fix yourself up, drew. Oh, man, that's Lauren Kelly. You needed to slap her beautiful ass... After what she did to you last night, man. Uh-uh. Drew, no. Keep walkin'. Don't look at her, man. Don't look at her, man.

She's gonna tease you, man ! Oh, that's all I need ! Somebody to see me with this good humor bike ! [ Gum pops ] You're in my light. Oh, i-i-i-I'm sorry. I didn't mean it. I'm sorry. Thank you. Did you lose something ? You're the operatic ballerina. Do I even know you ? Well, we have had an encounter or two. Are you junior's cousin ? Yeah, i'm junior's cousin ! Figures. Cuz, there's a pack of old ladies headin' this way. How much time do you need ? What'd you say your name was again ? Uh, my name is drew. Uh, drew Tate. [ Sea gulls cawing ] Y-y-y-you know, you know, you'd get a better lift with your pirouettes if you were to jump... Instead of leap, you know. Jump ! Put it here. Your legs, strong legs. Get you here. Kick it there. Kick it out. Whatever. Jerk. I'll see you when you do your pirouettes. If I were you, I wouldn't feel bad, 'cause she's like that with everybody. No, she was nice. Lauren, nice ? Ha ! Yeah. You saw that guy that walked by with that girl ? Yeah. That was Lauren's ex-boyfriend Alex. He dumped her to be with that fox he was with. What ? Mm-hmm. But don't worry.

[ Giggling ] Is that your stomach I hear growlin' ? Yeah, that's my stomach. [ Growling ] See ? Hungry. Go get some dessert. Mmm ! [ Laughing ] [ Laughing continues ] [ Clanking ] Listen, you know I got a sweet tooth for your love, girl. Hi. Hi. Aren't you the one that helped me up at the tennis match today ? Yeah. I thought so.

When the experiment got out of control, it was on me to put it out. And it didn't work. So the fire was an accident. Yeah. You think i'd burn down my own house ? I was trying to make some rocket fuel, and... The next thing I know, our house is on the news. What am I supposed to do ? Open up. Let the world meet iago's best friend. Everything will be all right. I know sometimes it seems as though... People don't appreciate you for who you are right now, But the ones who really, really count, they will catch on. Trust me. Hey. Well, hello... drew ? Right. Okay. Look at you. I like your hair. Oh, this old thing. I was waiting for my husband. He was supposed to be here over 30 minutes ago. I can take you where you have to go. [ Chuckles ] No, thank you.

That's unusual-- to find someone so young with an appreciation for jazz. Well, when I was a lot younger, I really didn't care for it much. Really ? How much younger was that ? Hey, man, where have I seen you before ? I don't know. Hi. I thought you had to work. And you were supposed to pick me up. Uh, yeah. You know what ? You're right. I am so sorry.

By a lowlife hustler ! - Black panther, my ass ! - Spence, honey ! Come on. Speak your mind, chump. Public informations officer ? I know what you did ! You ran the fuckin' copy machine ! That's better than bein' a honky's hiney-kissin' poli-fuckin'-tician... That would screw his own mother just to get ahead. No wonder your son is missin' a screw. Oh, shit. You want to talk about screws ? Talk to your wife. She is the one who's been complainin' about not gettin' a decent screw... Since she married your tight ass ! Fuck you.

I was a star. Oh, wow, it's gettin' late. What, you have to get home ? N-No. [ Snorting ] Ha ! Go home ? Me ? I can stay out all night if I want. Yeah, right. No, no, no, it's just that I thought maybe... Your parents would probably be worried. I don't want them to be mad at me and you. Don't worry about it. There are no folks. It's just me and my mother. And as long as I don't get pregnant, she could care less. Well, what happened with your father ? He split. But I've seen your folks on the beach. They seem pretty cool. Yeah, cool. They are usually. That's usually how it works, huh ? Yeah. So, um, which one will you go with when they split up ? What ? Come on, drew. How many people do you see with both their parents ? So which one will you go with when they split up ? I don't know. Whichever one'll have me, I guess. Hmm. You ever wonder if you somehow ended up on the wrong planet ? - What ? - I mean... Because you ask yourself questions that... You really shouldn't have to ask. Like what ? Like... "Is there a god ?" Or, or, or, or... "Why is there racism ?" Or "where do you go when you die ?" yeah. You know what, drew ? I've never thought about that. It's a good thing we got this little bucket. Yeah. You have a boyfriend ? No. Not right now. [ Laughing ] Whoo, well-- ahh. Here we are. Home sweet home. Yep. Safe and sound. Home sweet home for you. Drew, I had a really nice time tonight. And I had a very nice time too. [ Coughing ] What ? You know that they're havin' this big bicentennial thing on the fourth, right ? Yeah. I-I was thinkin' maybe, uh, you'd like to be my date. I mean, just for the night. Not the whole, entire night. You know, just for the night. Mmm. Okay, I'll go. Okay. Okay, good. So I guess I'll pick you up at 8:00. At 8:00 on the dot. Eight is my favorite number, so 8:00 on the dot. - Bye, drew. - Bye. Yes ! Yes ! [ Roaring ] What happened with Lauren Kelly ? Nothin' happened. Junior, get off me. Don't give me that jive. You were out with that girl for 12 1/2 hours. Nothin' happened. Okay, okay, okay ! I'll tell you. Just get off of me. I shouldn't tell you nothin'. But I can't help it. Okay, okay. First, I went to pick her up. Then we went to the arcade. Then we stole a lobster. Can you believe ? I stole a lobster. Don't tell my mom. Then we cooked the lobster. We ate the lobster, and we just sat at the beach... And built a fire and talked. And then ? And then we-- what ? We talked. Did you pop it ? No, no, we boiled it. Not the lobster, numb-nuts. I'm talkin' about Lauren. Did you get her legs open ? What ? No, I didn't get her legs open. Man, we're gonna have to work on that, drew. My cousin with Lauren Kelly ! Yeah. Wait 'til I tell the boys ! You don't have to tell them. [ Brenda ] Our little boy has no business out past midnight ! [ Kenny ] A boy that has pubic hair... Is ready to stay out late once or twice. [ Brenda ] He'll hear you. [ Kenny ] I hope he does ! I'm not ready to choose. [ Kenny ] You think he doesn't know that he has pubic hair ? I'm just not ready to choose. [ Kenny cackling ] Pubic hair ! Oh, man. Man. I don't even know how to choose. * [ boys giggling ] Wait ! We got two more months before school starts. Darryl, you say stupid stuff like that again, you're walkin' home. No, excuse me. This ain't your car, okay ? But it's my gas. Excuse me, but this is my car, and you will be walkin' home. Truck it. Out of sight. Yo, yo ! There he goes. Harold with his "client." [ Woman ] Brown sugar, you. [ Laughing ] Baby nat king Cole, scorin' again. Excuse me. I-I'll be right back, okay ? Where you goin' ? To pee ? [ Laughing ] [ Indistinct "sweet talk" ] Boy, you better stop it. [ Woman ] I want to buy him a birthday card. [ Indistinct ] Come here. Whoo ! [ Muttering ] Oh ! What a dog ! [ Doorbell ringing ] - Hi ! - Drew ! Hi ! Um, i-is your husband home ? Harold ? No, he had to work. Is there somethin' I can help you with ? [ Stuttering ] Look, Heather, I really have to tell you somethin'. Okay. Well, you know, it's kind of like-- well, you, what gave me the whole thing in my mind... Was... k-- uh-- even, even on the way over here ? I was tryin' to think-- drew, listen. I really gotta go. Can we talk about this later ? Yeah. I have to go too. Bye. You idiot ! Why didn't you tell her ? All you had to do was just tell her. But she looked so happy. Mr. Playboy won't get away with it. Good morning, mama. Good morning, Brenda. Happy fourth of July. Same to you. Have you seen Kenny? I saw him walking this morning toward the jetty. Thanks. Brenda ? Brenda ! Brenda ! I love you. The world's such a different place than when we first got together. Not just politics and fashion and music, but... People. And how they deal with each other. Like US ? Yeah. Like US. It used to be so much easier, so much easier to... Talk, just... Together. We lost it, Kenny, and I don't know how to get it back. But for our sake, yours and mine, and drew, we've gotta try and save it. So how do we do that ? How do we save it ? I don't know. I'm open to suggestion. Maybe we save it by remembering how it all started. With how the world was... Ahem, 16 years ago. Do you remember ? You ? You don't believe... That I ever stopped loving you, do you ? No. Good. 'Cause I haven't. Come here, baby. Gotcha. Say good-bye. Heather ! Heather ! Heather ! Heather ! Heather ! Heather ! Heather ! Heather ! Heather ! Heather ! [ Firecrackers popping ] [ Woman in white hat ] Boy, come here. What did I tell you ? Is there any more potato salad ? Oh, honey. Oh, boy. Here. Thanks. Pass the chicken, please. [ Mumbles ] - You're welcome. - I said thank you. - I didn't hear it. - Well, just because you didn't hear it-- you didn't-- [ Sighs ] Doesn't mean I didn't say it. [ Groans ] Look, Spence, I'm sorry about what happened in the game the other day. Yeah. Well... No need to apologize. Learned a very important lesson that day. Never, uh, never judge a book by its cover ? - I learned an important lesson too. - What's that ? Black Republicans can fight. Yeah, well, black Republicans have to. I found that out the first time I walked into your house. - How's that ? - Any brother that's got nerve enough... To put Richard Nixon on his wall has got to know how to deal. You're all right, man. You too. You too. Drew, man, I think that tie is a bit much. No, I think it's all right. Take it from the kid, man. I think it's a bit much. Wait a minute. Aren't I the one goin' out with Lauren Kelly ? While you, on the other hand, will be spendin' the afternoon with your two stooges. You know, I would come over there and smack you, but damn, it's kinda true. Yes, it is kinda true. Come here, guy. Hold your hand out. What's this ? "Jade east" ? Yep, that's the good stuff. All right. Get some-- don't put on too much. You'll kill the moment. And last but not least, the piece of resistance: The no-baby balloon, my treat. Uh, I don't think I'll be needing that. You afraid it won't fit ? [ Laughing ] I'm just kiddin', drew. But seriously, man, there are a lot of daddies out there who said the same thing you just said. So, just take it, all right ? Thanks. You're gonna be late for your date, man. Yes ! I got a date ! You gotta tell me everything that happens. Everything ? Everything, drew. I'll think about it. Yeah, right.
