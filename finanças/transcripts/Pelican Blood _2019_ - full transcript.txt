PELICAN BLOOD Sweetheart. Oh, it's already so late. I've got to prepare the riding hall. Bye, Mom! Don't get another speeding ticket. Shit! - Are you okay? - Unbelievable! - Suddenly he's bucking. - Top Gun wasn't ready. He's a bucker. He's untrainable. - What do we do now? - Sell him. What? Sigrid, it was one time. The risk is too great, he has been a problem from the start. We've trained for weeks. Top Gun isn't right for this. He'll only be trouble. - You can't do that! - Good boy. I'm taking him outside. What if Wiebke takes a look at him? - To waste even more time? - I need a few days. With Alma too. - He attacked me. - He's just figuring out who's the boss. Show him who's in charge. How much longer should I run after him? So, how's it going? Come on out. Okay, Top Gun. Now, show me what you've got! Go. Gallop! Gallop! Good, good... Come. So, how's it going? - Thank you. - Thank you. - I should have brought sleeping bags. - Uh-huh. Stand here. What now? Don't turn around. Okay. Reward him. - Reward him. Good boy. Good boy. - Hey. - Yeah. - Yeah. So, now he's ready to work with you. It's called a "join up." Did you have a bad dream? We were in the orphanage, and she was also there. And I was really, really happy. But then suddenly you were both gone. You went back to Germany without me. You forgot all about me. I'd never forget you. You're the person I love the most in the whole wide world. Can I look at the picture again? Yes. Where is it? Wait a sec... Here. Wow, she's pretty. - Are we already sisters? - No, not quite yet. - We want to meet her first. Right? - But then? Then yes. Do you remember the first time we saw each other? You didn't make a sound. You snuggled up to me the whole time. That tickles. - What did he say? - "Aren't there any orphans in Germany?" Single women who work can't adopt children in Germany. - "You're not married either?" - Lots of kids, lots of work! He thinks you're crazy. You have one week to get to know Raya. If you then decide to adopt her official permission will be applied for. Once the court has... Do you like this picture? Her chicks are dead but the pelican mother pierces her breast and feeds them with her blood, thus bringing them back to life. Are you ready? There you are. - Hello. - Hello, Hagen. - Did you have a good trip? - Yes. Come on! - Look out! - Horse. A white horse. Look. - This is a small bunny. - Small bunny. That's for you. Look, these are carrots. Broccoli. Tofu hotdogs. Give it a try. Okay? You can eat it. Is it good? Soon she'll explode. You want to make sure you won't starve here? It's time to say goodnight to your sister. Sleep well. Here's a kiss from Bunny too. I'll be right there. We waited so long for you. And now you're finally here. From so far away. Don't be afraid. I'll take good care of you. I promise. Sleep well. Can't sleep, sweety? - Say hi to Charmeur. - Hi, Samore. Come on. Let's wash him down. He's all dirty. - Oh, pardon me. - Not so wild, you two. - Are you tying him up outside? - Yes. Those two get along well, don't they? Stay calm. Calm. Calm. Come on. Very good. Hey, where are you going? I'll show you something. But you can't tell Mom about it. This is my hiding place. Hiding place. Nikolina, where are you two? Hey, stop that. Don't throw food. Stop smacking your lips. Don't smack your lips, Raya. That's disgusting. No, Raya! What are you doing? Come on, eat properly. Oh, God! Oh, please! Wait! Stop doing... Ew, that's really crappy. Okay, take my pancake. Listen! Stop that now. Take your foot off the table. Raya, I'm warning you! Come down here now! You are finished. Okay. If that's how you want it. Are we testing the boundaries? Huh, aren't you ticklish? What's up? Aren't you ticklish? Laugh a bit. Everyone's excited to meet you. Should we take a look inside? Take a look. You can build nice big towers here. I can come with you. Maybe she's not ready. Mom! Mom! Mom! Raya! Get down from there! - She bit me! - What? Give Bunny back! Raya, let the bunny go! Calm down. What got into you? I'm sorry, sweetheart. We'll sew it back on, okay? It's all right. What's she doing now? Oh, no! Oh, no! I'm sorry. Stop now. Stop. Come, Noah. - Hi. - Hello. Hi. Oh, thank you. Thanks. - Great to see you. - Great to have you here. - Hello, Wiebke. - Hello. This is my sister, Raya. Hello, Raya. She's so cute. This here is for you. - Oh, how nice. Say thank you. - Tank you. - Don't you want to open it? - Are you coming? - How was the drive? - There was a bit of traffic. It looks great here. It'll be a veritable paradise. And now you've got the mounted squad at the stable. Congratulations. There's still so much to do. When the rooms are done... It'll be beautiful. So? Tell me... How are things with the three of you? Good. Good. How's she sleeping? - Well... - Does she wet the bed? - No. - You're lucky. Mabou and Jackson did for months. Now all you need is a dad for the two. Come on. Do you know where Noah is? Where are they? Noah! - Have you seen Raya? - No. I'll go check the horses and make sure they didn't go in there. Raya, where are you? - Noah! - Where are you? Raya, where are you? Ah, there they are. Where were you? Come on, let's go eat. Lunch is ready. Everything okay? Are you hungry? - Great job, grill master. - Thanks. Cheers. - Rock, paper, scissors. - Paper. - Rock, paper, scissors. - Scissors. Don't play with that. It's too dangerous, honey. We'd better go home tonight. Noah is burning up. What? - Is he getting sick? - I don't know. He's been acting strange since this afternoon. - See you! - Bye! Top Gun's doing well. - He's a beautiful animal. - The date of his serenity test is set. I count on you to make this work. Are the kids in bed? What are you doing here so late? I just wanted to tell you... You're doing great with Top Gun. You work with problem horses a lot, don't you? The horses aren't the problem. Right. We don't take enough time with them. It's easier to get rid of a horse than to give it the proper attention. When I was 15 or 16 I got into a lot of trouble. Thankfully, there was one person who believed in me. A person like that can change your whole life. I have to go to bed. Do you maybe want to do something this weekend? A change of scenery? It's hard for me to get away. It's tricky with the kids. That's not what I meant. Not a date. I meant with the kids. - Something fun. - Oh, I see. - Okay? - Okay. - Look! Like on our barn. - Yeah. Gable decoration. It's not decoration. It's an age-old thing. But back then they used real horse heads and set them up on poles next to the house. - You're joking. - It's true. To drive out evil spirits. To protect one's home and family. As a sacrifice. Is it ghost story time? Come on, put that back down. Raya! There's Benedikt! Hey, you. - Hello. - Hi. This here is my son, Jojo. - Johannes. - Hi, Jojo. - Do you want to fight me? - Yes. - You never told me you have a family. - Didn't I? - Where's Jojo's mom now? - We've been separated for a while. - I'm sorry. - I don't believe you. Were you ever married? The children are lucky to have you. I'm the lucky one. - Good morning, honey. - Get off. - Let me snuggle with you. - Get off! Come on, time to get up. Time to get up. So... What's that smell? Have you been hoarding food again? But that's not it. No. The smell is different. What's this? Me not do it. What color is this card, Raya? It's blue. That's not correct. - Try again. - It's purple. I'm sorry, that's wrong. Orange! Red! Black! - And this one here? - Yellow. She knows the colors. Raya clearly thinks she'd lose control by giving us the right answers, and she's not prepared to trust adults. Our paediatrician was maybe a bit hasty in sending us to you. Have you ever heard of reactive attachment disorder? It's a relational disorder that often emerges after severe emotional neglect or other traumatic experiences. Yeah, I think I know what you mean, but... - Raya was different at first. - Sure. She was scouting out the situation and showed you her best side. It's what we all do when starting a new relationship. We should start therapy immediately. - Therapy? - It's a serious disorder. This is likely just the tip of the iceberg. I'd like to keep it from getting so bad that one day you give your daughter up. The first priority is to give Raya structure and a strict set of rules. Consistency creates dependability and thus a trusting relationship. Mom! Is it her poop? - Me not do it. - But I can see that you did it! Don't... So... We take the washcloth. - And clean this up, now. - No! - No! - Come on. Raya... No! No, no, no! - I want new mommy! - You won't get a new mom. I'm your mom now, and I'm staying your mom. - You're poo poo. - Raya. No! No! Scream as much as you want, Raya. You'll stay here till you clean this up. Mom! Can you make sure she cleans it up? She can't play till she does. - I have homework to do. - Can't you do it in front of the door? Please. Stay right here. Thank you. Stay calm. Okay? - Relax when you come to an obstacle. - I am relaxed. Not totally. Top Gun feels your unease. He picks up the vibe right away. Start again from back there. Alma, you and Top Gun get in the middle. We'll turn the flames down a notch. Okay. Good. Good. Your little girl's about to lose her voice. Hagen, will you turn it up again? Let's take a short break. I have to pee. She's got some stamina, huh? Done. You did a great job. I love you. Thank you. Landau. What? She bit Lasse during nap time. - He had to go to the hospital. - Goodness! Then she burnt the tables with a lighter. I can't find it, though. She must have hid it. Maybe it's still all too much for her. She's causing serious problems here. I'll talk to her. I promise. Raya! Hello, Paula. - Is it your birthday? How old are you? - Four. Four! That's great. Isn't Raya invited? Paula got to decide herself who to invite. Couldn't Raya come too? She hasn't made many friends. There's already too many. - We could bring our pony, Charmeur. - Yes. Do I need to say it more clearly? No one wants to play with your daughter. Stop, please! Raya. Please stop. Stop kicking! Mom! Mom! Mom! Get out of here. Out. Out. - Where's Bunny? - Niki. - Niki, get out of here. - No! - Get out! - Not without Bunny! Niki! He doesn't matter now. - No! No! - Come on, Niki. Please. I'll get him for you. I promise. - Come on. - No! We have to get out of here. I'll get him for you right away. - Come. - No! - No! - Niki, stop! We have to get out. - No! - Niki, please stop! You two stay here! Stay here! How does this work? Look here. See what I have? You did this on purpose! I hate you. - Stop, Niki! - No one wants you! No one loves you! - Don't say that to your sister. - I don't have a sister anymore! I want her to go away and never come back! That's enough! Ask her yourself! She's already had other families. - They also gave her back! - Who says so? She told me so herself. - You give me away. - No, I won't. I won't give you away. I would never do that. Come on, you two. Make up, won't you? Why was she cleared for foreign adoption? Yes. I thought I heard something. Are you also afraid of her? What's this? - Hey. - Hey. - I knocked on your door yesterday. - Oh. I heard you'd had a fire. I was worried about you. It wasn't serious. The kids were playing. Is there any way I can help? So... Done. - What's that? - We can turn it on. Like this. And then when Raya gets up at night... Then I'll hear this. And I'll grab her. See? There's no reason to be afraid. Nikolina saw that you had a lighter. I didn't have it! - Can I play? - After you admit you started the fire. Me not do it! Me not do it! Me not do it! I'm sure you'll remember. Me do it. Good. Very good. I love you. - I wanted it go away. - What did you want to go away? - Were you mad at Nikolina? - No. - I wanted it go away, the dumb thing. - What dumb thing? You mean the bunny? You wanted it gone? No. That thing there. - I don't see anything. - It does bad things. It makes Raya do bad things. No, Raya. Tell me the truth. You did it, and you're responsible. It wasn't me! So she's telling the truth? For her, there's something there. - An imaginary friend? - It protects her. She dissociates to fend off feelings of guilt. And to have a protector. - What do I do? - It's called the "magic phase." Raya is at an impasse. Part of her seems to like you and would like to trust you. The other... wants to hurt you. University Hospital is conducting a study on children with early-life trauma. They do comprehensive tests you'd never get in standard diagnostics. I would recommend putting her in the study. Okay, it's finished. If you ask me, it won't stop her from starting another fire. Raya sat next to her dead mother for two days before the neighbors found her. Her mother was a prostitute. A john killed her and just left the girl behind. She was barely one and a half. There were bite marks all over the mother. Raya probably tried to wake her up. - You have to think of Niki too. - Of course I'm thinking of her. Hey. - What's wrong, big man? - I don't want to play with Raya anymore. Why not? Did you wet your pants? But honey, we were done with that. You were doing so well. Raya? Wiebke! Telephone! It's okay as long as both kids want it. But that's not the case here. Raya systematically chose small and helpless kids for her doctor game. I'll talk to her. It won't happen again. Ms. Landau, we can't afford to lose the majority of our kids just so we can keep one child with special needs. What's that supposed to mean? The other parents want Raya to leave our pre-school. It was decided yesterday. - Decided? - Yes. And no one talked to me? No one let me say anything? A traumatized kid is really taxing, huh? The girl should be given a helping hand! - Ms. Landau... - No! You preferred to kick Raya out behind our backs! It's incredibly gutless and it makes me sick! Don't keep me in suspense. Look here. This is the amygdala. It's responsible for emotions. This part of the brain is almost entirely stunted in Raya. It's a serious morphological impairment. The test results lead me to the clear conclusion that Raya feels neither empathy nor fear. Take the word "mother." For her it's like "chair" or "lamp." It's just a word, with no emotional charge. But there were times when she showed feelings. Can you give me concrete examples? The first time she was in my arms. - She was happy. - She smiled, right? She imitated your facial expression. Without empathy. Without feeling anything. She feels nothing at all? - Can it be cured? - Well, a cure requires a disease. But who says that Raya is sick? Our society. Our norms. Your daughter is as she is for a good reason. Her psyche protected her from emotional torment. It saved her life. Can you help her? There's a very good institution. They take only a small number of patients. It's like a group home. The staff is trained to deal with children like Raya. You want to put her back in a home? You have to think of your other daughter too. But there... No one will love her there. Love isn't enough for Raya. It's quite likely that despite years of treatment Raya will persist in her pathology. The brain can be trained, you know. But the older a person gets, the slower the process. Raya is now five. - We can't expect miracles. - What would a miracle look like? If Raya had a fixed caregiver after her birth with whom she managed to develop a close relationship then the emotional pathways would be there and simply be buried. Theoretically, there'd be a possibility of reactivating them. - I got an A. - Really? - In what? - Math. That's great! She can do that herself. I don't think Raya ever had a chance to be a baby. We're making up for that now. Right? Please stop. "This is a side effect of the drug domperidone forte. It's not approved in Germany for stimulating milk production but many women react quickly. A manual massage is also recommended. Several times a day, a half hour each time." Hi, Sigrid. Where were you? - Sorry. - Can you please do that after work? - What? - What you're doing with your kid. - Put her down. - No. It'll be fine. We can manage today without you. Can you take her off of me? Please? - Okay? - Come here. - Wait... Great. - It's fine. Thanks. How about I cook something for us this evening? Today's no good. Can you put yourself to bed tonight? - Don't I get a story? - Tomorrow. Okay? Raya. Come here. Great. Come here. See... See if this tastes good. Give it a try. Here. I wish I'd been able to be there for you when you were a tiny baby. But we didn't know each other then. Say "Mom." Mom. You're fart. We'll figure this out. What are you doing there? It's our secret. Okay? Okay? Feel how warm she is. Carrying us both makes her sweat. - She sweating. - Yes. Go ahead and pet her. She likes it. She has feelings, just like you and me. There you are, Niki. - Hello. - Hello. Benedikt! Hi. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - I'm glad you could make it. - Come on, Jojo. Merry Christmas. Wow! We shouldn't have too much fun today. Raya likes to ruin nice moments. I try to avoid situations that get her out of whack. But it's Christmas and Niki's so happy. She's one heck of a girl. I can't undo this. Look here. You have to wear your helmet. Me too? - Hands up! I'm taking you to jail. - Raya! Hey, stop! - Hey, that's mine! - Raya! - Raya, give Jojo his hat back. - Come here. Good idea. Who can scream the loudest? Come on. Okay. Bye, girls. - Bye bye! - Bye, girls. Get in the car. Niki likes you a lot. I like you a lot. I... It's beautiful. Dad, I'm cold! What's wrong? Is it here now? What is it doing? It's coming for you. Are these things yours? What is it? A talisman? For protection. A friend made it. Wiebke. You have a visitor. Hey! This is a surprise. What are you doing here? Hi. - Did something happen? - Want to take a walk? The day we had the barbecue, Raya and Noah disappeared. Remember? Afterwards he was acting so weird and came down with a fever. - Don't you remember? - Of course I do. It happened again in the fall. What happened? Bibi, what are you talking about? She violated him. Stuck a stick or something in his behind. Don't you have anything to say? You have to talk to the pre-school. Who knows what else she did. She doesn't go anymore. Why not? Bibi, we're finally making progress. We just need a little time. Are you totally insane? She has to go. You can't handle this. She's sick. The girls always played here in summer. - Good luck. - With what? - Today is Top Gun's serenity test. - Yes, of course. Bye. Where have you been? Thanks for believing in him. We've become a really good team. Everything okay? - Okay, this pest is going to her room. - No! - You too. Come on. - No! Five, four, three, two, one. Come on. You too. Hey. Hey. You know, I'm dying to look at you. I'd like to kiss all your tears and snot away. I don't understand you. Do you really want to go on like this? It's not good for you. And it's not good for Niki. Sigrid is looking for a new stable for the mounted squad. - I thought you should know. - Hey. - How are you doing? - Okay. Are you coming? Come on. The first round's on me. Don't be a spoilsport. Everyone's there. Yeah. Can I do anything else for you? - No chips. - But I'm hungry. Yeah. - Do you know where the cutter is? - What would I do with it? Raya. - Do you know where the cutter is? - What is cutter? An extendable knife. Her alarm wasn't on. Five minutes. Did you have it? I wanted to cut Niki's skin off. - You wanted to cut Niki's skin off? - She should be dead! And you too! I come when you sleep, I make you dead. Landau. Okay. We'll leave now. Yeah. Are you ready? Raya, stop! No, Ms. Landau! Don't let yourself get carried away! No, you can't do that now. Am I broken? - Come on. Stop! - Mom! Mom! - Stop that! Let her go! - Mommy! She's not ready! Some parents wait years for a place here. You only got one because of Dr. Zaruba. You have till next week. Then another kid gets the spot. Mom. Nikolina. - Benedikt? - Yeah? - What's up? - Come with me. Have you shown anyone else? Come on. More. More. - More! - No. Hagen? This is Tanka. She can help you with Raya. Shit! - Did something happen? - An incident at the protest. They threw rocks and Molotov cocktails. All hell broke loose. We rode in to defuse the situation. Top Gun got hit right in the head. He went crazy and charged into the crowd. - Anyone injured? - Four protesters. Two severely. He bucked Alma off. She got lucky. She's coming in the next car. He's had it. Let him out into the corral. He has to get it out of his system. How is he? Is he badly injured? Just look at him! Don't. Don't, Alma. He's still totally confused. This is dangerous. Alma, I have a bad feeling about this. Please get out of there. Are you crazy? You can't do a join up right now. Get out of there! He's charging! - Why did you do that? - He attacked her. - But I told her it was dangerous. - What do you mean by that? Who's more important? The horse? Everyone's closed for the weekend. I can't arrange a transport till Monday. It's okay. It's going to be okay. He was a beautiful animal. When a child experiences something awful the pain can be so severe that... a part of the soul saves itself and... hides away, and something like an energetic void is left. Something has taken root in there. A being. - Can we get rid of it? - It's been there a long time. It must be convinced to leave. Only then can the lost part of her soul be brought back. Till then, this child... doesn't have feelings and can't feel love. A dead chick. Her sister can't be present. An exorcism of this kind is very dangerous. The attached being would seek out the nearest weak person. You really shouldn't be there either. I see a void in you. But the mother has to be there. The mother has to give life. - Why are these hanging everywhere? - They're for good luck. I thought you might like them. I know you sometimes doubt it, but you're the most important thing to me in the whole world. Without you, I'd be so unhappy I could never laugh again. This is made of horsehair. It will protect you. Being from another world tell me your name. I thank you for protecting this child. You have performed your task well, but now... it is time for you to go. Go now. Set the girl free. It refuses to go. But we can get rid of it? Getting rid of it will require great effort. - How long will it take? - I can't say. - A few weeks. Months. - No. It has to go now. It can't stay. There could be another way. But it's black magic. There's always a price to pay. When you take a journey, you come back changed. Niki, I locked your room because I didn't want you to get scared. What's going on here? Hm? Niki called me. She's worried. She told me about the woman who's here. Who speaks with spirits? Called Tanka? - Will you watch her? - What happened? - It's my business. - Not when you endanger your kids. Are you here as a cop? That woman knows you're in bad shape. That Raya is sick. And so she tells you what you want to hear. What does she say? That she can help you? It won't help Raya. She's been through enough madness, hasn't she? - Stop finally. With everything. - "Everything." What does that mean? Carrying her around. Nursing her. You're right. I really have been a bit confused recently. I just thought I'd give it a try. I didn't want to frighten anyone. - Where is she now? - Gone. She just burnt some incense around the house. Is Jojo with you this weekend? Yes. Why? Could Niki maybe... sleep at your place tonight? You always have great fun together. She's fed up with me right now. Okay. Thanks. Look here. This one's nice, isn't it? What have you found? That's a very special feather. I am sure Tanka can help us. To really become mother and daughter. But you have to want it too. Then you don't have to go away. You can stay with me. And Nikolina. That bad thing. Is it here now? Yes. It will never go away. Do you want that? No. Tanka has the power to make it go away and never return. But you have to help me. Tonight's a blue moon. Do you know what that is? It gives us women very special power. Now your name. Wiebke... Landau. I drive you out, Repugnance, here and now, and put you in this head. From now on, protect this house from all the evil forces of this world. The lost part of the soul. Hi, Mom. - Was it nice? - Yes. - Benedikt has a pool. - Wow! I'm going to get my school bag ready. Thank you. Watch out for the tarp! Hey! Hey! Stop that thing. Where is it? - Where is the head? - It's not your concern. Put it back down. Do it already! Just burnt incense? Is beheading horses also part of your voodoo bullshit? Don't! It has owie. No, honey. It died. The horsy's dead? Yes. It doesn't hurt anymore. Is my mom... My mom is... also dead. Come on. Let's go have a nice breakfast. No school today. We found a new stable.
