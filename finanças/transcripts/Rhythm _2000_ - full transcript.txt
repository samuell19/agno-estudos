Sir! This is Jui Nagar area in Mumbai. This area is in the processing of developing. Just like Gajuvaka of your Vizag. Why are you looking at the bathroom, sir? There, sir. That is kitchen. You can use this as dining hall. But there is no table here. Sir! Ten thousand rent and one lakh advance. This is window, sir. If you open it.. ..you will get a lot of air. If you open it during day, people might also blown away. If you open it during night.. ..even the furniture will be blown away with people. I forgot to tell you. Did you see that water tank? Amitabh Bachan's house is next to it. That tall cinema actor.. 'Kaun banega Karodpati' It's alright. But what colour shirt are you wearing? What was the colour that you told me that you'll be wearing? Is this meroon colour? Now I don't have that colour shirt, sir? Some fellow has stolen it last night. There are many thieves here, sir. Thank you! Excuse me! I am Karthik from Vizag. Nice meeting you, sir. Go straight and turn left. That's your cabin. - Thank you. How long are you going to take, sir? You are getting late for the office. Hurry up. My mom and dad are coming. I'll take two liters milk extra. I told the watchman. I hope he doesn't forget. He is a fool, sir. - Why is that? He irritates me saying good morning whever I go out or come in. That is why I slapped him. Why did you slap him for saying good morning? He turns left and say good morning if I am right side.. ..and turns right if I am left. May be his eye sight is not proper. I took him to eye specialist thinking that. I hope you too would have visited the doctor. - Yes. There will be a big board there. - Yes, I know. Doctor showed him a small letter on it and asked him to recognize it. He said he don't know. Doctor showed him a big letter but he gave the same answer. Doctor showed him the biggest letter 'A' and asked him to recognize it. He said he cannot. Then the doctor was irritated and asked 'do you know who I am?'. You are a doctor, he said. Then why didn't he recognize letters? He was illitrate. So he couldn't read. Don't forget about him. When will your parents come? - Tomorrow. Okay. Sir! Where are your legs, sir? - Oh! Sorry! I thought you kept a big ashtray for me. It's alright. I will throw it outside. Buildings in our village will be in sleeping position.. ..and here they stand high. That's it. Water is sweet, okay for drinking. Kitchen is big too. You are not the one who will cook anyway. Why is that? If you are in the kitchen for two days.. ..you will fall sick for the next two days What is the need for all that? You have arthritis problem. He is talking about it. We should find a medicine for your problem first. You are asking me not to cook. Then how are we going to eat food then? I have arranged for food. There is a mess nearby. Mess?! This is Mumbai. My jaws will pain if I eat chapati. Can't we get rice? Mess belongs to our state people. Give this address to the people you want to give. I wrote to Ajay. Give me the address. I will note down. Don't worry, dad. Give me. - Bye! See you, mom. I will be back soon in the evening. Very good! Your leg and your wish. Do whatever you like. My leg is paining because of train journey. That is why I kept it like this. If anyone see you, they think that you are about to kick me. Keep both the legs up. Don't open the door without asking if anyone rings the bell. Dad! Don't leave mom alone and go. Hey, you go to the office. I am looking after her for 45 years. Don't I know that? Bread is in the fridge. And the carriage will come at 12 o'clock. If he gets married, we won't need to get food from the hotel. We asked him many times. We cannot force him. Victory to nurses strike! Victory to nurses strike! Hello, sisters! No matter how much you shout, there is no use. Victory to nurses strike! We fought a lot for this. Victory to nurses strike! What did this society do for us? We want justice. Victory to nurses strike! Victory to nurses strike! Victory to nurses strike! Thank you! Sir! I wanted to open a bank account. Why did you bring me to ladies college? Banks can have counters in women's colleges too. Shouldn't we open an account there? We will deposit and withdraw our money. Moreover it is colourful! Sir! We get interest for the amount we deposit in every bank. But here depositing money is interesting. Come with me. There won't be any male employee in this bank, sir. Everyone is ladies. Saris and dresses. Ladies are very innocent. Why is that? Look at their faces. I am asking why do you think so. If they wear saris, we can look at their waists. If they wear churidars we can look at their faces. If they wear midis, we can look at their legs. Where do you look if they wear shirt? Then we can look at their pockets. Stop talking nonsense. - This is nothing, sir. Sir, this is Mumbai! You will see how girls here are. Some of men have a bad habit. Do you know what it is? Is that so? What is it? They leer at other men's wives. If another man leers at his own wife, he gets uncomfortable. You are talking about me. I can understand that. Oh, you are very intelligent. - Stop it, sir. You are smart. Excuse me! It is Rs. 4950. Fifty rupees less. Two notes may be stuck together. Please check. Why are you speaking in Telugu in Mumbai, sir. Talk in Hindi. You saw the book she is reading.. ..and recognized that she knows Telugu. You are great, sir. Show me your legs, please! - Wait, sir. A small test. Look at their faces and tell me from which state they are. Hello! - Come on, let us go. Excuse me, you can sit in my seat if you want. No need. You were standing, so.. - What's wrong in standing? No, I saw you at the bank today morning. We both are from the same state.. It's alright. Now even I cannot sit in that seat. Someone else took it. How many times should we tell you that trains are on strike. Trains will not run. Go! Strike! Go away. Sir! Do you want auto? Where do you want to go? Indian Express! Will you come by meter? Definitely! Please come. You didn't change even after coming to Mumbai. You are the one who didn't change and not us. Hello! Trains straike and peak hours. Auto drivers charge at least 150rupees. Instead of giving 150 each by going separately.. ..let us go together. My office is next to your bank. Correct meter, sir. Isn't she coming? May be she isn't interested. Go now. Excuse me! I'm 16 years old and you are 15. As if I gave you a love letter and you tore it apart.. Why do you run away from me? You see! I have to know the reason. Yesterday train were on strike. I asked you to come in the auto but you didn't. That I can understand. It is because you have to sit next to me in the auto. But what's wrong in travelling in the train? This is 21st century. You are not a village girl. What's wrong if you take the same train as me? Why should I come in the same train as you? I don't like unnecessary association and talk with anyone. Even I am like that. You misunderstood me. I wanted to clear your misunderstanding. That is why I got down the train. I offered you a seat in the train that day. And also about sharing the auto, I don't have any ill intentions behind them. We stay in the same area and go to jobs by same route. And catch the train at the same station. I have an account in your bank and we are Indians. There is no ulterior motives behind me talking to you. I am not a bad person like you think. Hats off to you. If I see you again, I will move away. Your account's cheque isn't cleared yet. What can I do even if you are in a hurry? You come after some time. What is it, sir? Don't you have balance in the account? Should I lend you some? I have money, sir. I have deposited the cheque three days back. But it has not been cleared. I told you that I will lend you money. You think that taking money from me is bad. You want money from your account. Is that all? You have recognized that she knows.. ..Telugu by looking at the book she is reading. Go and talk to her in Telugu and explain everything. There ends the matter. Come on, sir. - Sir! She will not help me for sure. Why wouldn't a Telugu girl help a Telugu guy? Telugu people won't help fellow Telugu people. Is there any rule about it? You wouldn't speak like this if you know the story of Telugu crabs. I know crabs. What is this Telugu crab? Is there some story for it? There are some crabs in a long bottle. Someone caught them and put them inside. After some time two crabs escaped pushing the bottle cap open. It is found that they are Malayalam crabs. - Oh! They come first everywhere. After that two Hindi crabs came out easily. After that crabs from Karnataka, Assam, Gujarat came out slowly. But Telugu crabs neither made any sound nor came out. When looked inside for the reason, when one crab was climbing up.. ..another Telugu crab was pulling it down. If one tries to go up, other will pull it down and vice versa. Like that both of them couldn't come out of the bottle. Sir! Is this a story or real? If we ask for help because of same state, what if that person pull us down? I think you are very short tempered. Are you from Guntur? - Why? Since it is famous for it's spicyness. Show me your legs, please! - No, it's alright. Come on. 150! One minute! He is a native person and may cheat. Let me bargain. He agreed. Let me reduce it even further. Okay. He packed it already. Let me ask it for less. Take this. Fifty rupees?! Why don't you ask it for free? If you want to give it for free then.. You are speaking in Telugu. Aren't you Hindi man? Aren't you dumb? That is why I wrote it on the slate. I don't know Hindi. That is why I was gesturing. How did you find out about me? Is it because I asked you to reduce the price? A Telugu person pulls down another Telugu person. I found like that. Do you know Telugu crab story? Why is he running away? How much? Ticket please! Didn't you take the ticket? Sorry, sir! I was in a hurry. You look like educated and travelling without ticket? Sorry! - Pay the fine. I'll pay! I'll pay! This is the first time it has happened like this. Hello! Just a minute. Did you call me? How much did you pay? - Hundred rupees. Train started by the time I reached the platform. So I got in without taking the ticket. That is why.. - You will not face such problems if you buy season ticket. I went there but there was a long queue. After that in work tension.. What is the hurry? There is a train for every ten minutes. I have a photo session in the main studio. First I have to go home and then go to studio. That is why.. Okay, sir! What about your interview of cultural activities? It is very difficult, sir. It is difficult to go to the shooting spot. It is very difficult to interview a Hindi heroine. - Why is that? I went to studio round-up one day. Shooting arrangements were going on there. A new heroine. She has to come out from the bathroom with a towel. He said that if she agrees, she will be paid any amount she wants. She accepted and took the cheque. After setting up the lighting and shot ready, she refused to come. Why is that? - She has to wear a towel. She took the money for that only. Correct, she did take the money. But they asked that the towel should be worn on the head. There was only one towel. How can she wear it only the head? What happened to the shooting? After that everyone discussed. Finally her mother acted in that. Picture was super hit, sir. Hello! Hello! Excuse me, please! One minute! I saw it in the train. Police brought you here. They didn't bring me. I came here to file a complaint. Is there any problem? Someone has stolen my handbag. Who is that? When I was walking on the platform.. A boy.. might be ten years old.. He was walking along me. Suddenly I felt like something fell on me. I mentioned about a small boy.. He told me to use the water nearby and wash it When I came back after washing, my handbag was missing. He was running away with my bag. This was all his plan. He only put the banana skin and the water to wash. Just see how he planned. - My god! The police inspector who was there asked me to file a complaint. That is why.. Sit there and write the complaint. Sit down. I am sorry. You can keep it. - It's alright. Was your heart in your handbag that he has stolen it? I will be back in a moment. We do every work very quickly in this station. Hello! You see.. I know three south Indian women. Hemamalini, Sridevi.. ..and you Chitra. Nice height and perfect figure. I like south Indian women. Hey, I will find your bag by evening. I hope you gave your contact number. - Yes, sir. I gave you my bank's number. Bank?! Very good. Who is he? Friend? - Yes, friend. I see. The guy who steals the handbag of.. ..a beautiful lady like you should be punished. I'll break his bones. No! Don't beat him. He is just a kid. You have a very soft heart. I don't know Hindi, not even bits and pieces. What did the inspector said to upset you so much? He said that he will break the bones of the thief. I told them not to be severe since he is a kid. You have a very soft heart. That's what he said. In Hindi. Do you have umbrella? - What for? It is going to rain for sure today. - Why is that? When I told the inspector that I am your friend, you agreed. It will surely rain. Before that shall we have a cup of coffee? There is a nice coffee shop nearby. Shall we go? No, please! You would have agreed if I invited you for lunch I suppose. No. I will say no even then. Are you going to the bank? - Yes. Auto! Auto! First auto for you and second one for me. Surprised about two autos? You won't travel with me in the same auto. Please! Bye! Do you know Telugu? Madam! Did you take honey a lot since your childhood? Your voice is very sweet. That is why I asked. Can you see my face through phone? You stopped talking suddenly. So I asked. Will you please give the phone to Mr. Khartik Mr. Karthik? Yes, he is here. Sir! Some lady is asking for you. Hello! This is Chitra speaking. Did I disturb you? No, what is it? I got a phone from the police station that they found my bag. They asked me to come there to take it. I don't want to go there alone.. If you don't mind, will you come with me? Check your personal belongings, please! Count the amount. Is it okay? Is everything present? I told you that I know three south Indian women. Hemamalini married Dharmendra. Sridevi married Bony Kapoor. And you Chitra marries who? Hello! Your way of talking is irritating. Better stop that. Okay, thank you! Thank you! Hello! Hello! We still have half day leave. Should we go to our offices cancelling the leave? Should I call for two autos? No. If you have confidence, come to my house. My mom and dad will be happy. They will be happy to see something speaking Telugu. How much? - Sixty rupees dozen. Hello! Do you want me to stay or go? I have invited you to my house. You are buying fruits without answering me. If I know your answer.. My mother used to say that we shouldn't go to someone's house empty handed. That is why I am buying these fruits. - Ah! What happened? - You accepted my invitation. I pinched to check whether this is dream or reality. It is real. Auto! Lift in our flats works once in a year. What did that auto driver tell you showing me? What was he saying? Nothing! - No, he was talking about me. You will get angry if I tell you. - It's alright. Tell me. No, leave it. I don't mind. Please tell me. You didn't come in the auto on the day of trains strike. He asked why you won't come and I said it is a tradition of pious women. We came together now, so he said that we became friends. Will you meet that auto driver once again? - why do you ask? If you meet again, tell him this. Tell him that though I came with you.. ..I still follow the tradition of pious women. That's true. You sat on the other edge of the auto. I was scared that you might fall on the road. What is your name? - Chitra. It is very sweet name. My dear! Isn't it the name of Goddess? No, you always misunderstand everything. Chitta is the name of a star. And the name Chitra is another form of that. My wife always misunderstand the things. She gives tea when I ask for coffee and coffee if I ask for tea. After we got married she used to ask me if there are.. ..Muslim and Christian papers just like the Hindu paper. Water? - Thanks! My parents are like comedians. Only they don't fight. Are you working in the same office as my son? No, sir! I am working in Indian bank. How did you meet him? Mom! I have an account in that bank. - I see. This is.. - Oh, no! Bathroom is on that side. Go and wash it. Water will be light yellow in colour. Don't be afraid. She said that she is working in some bank. Why did our son bring her home? Hey, can't you keep quiet for a while? He will scold you if he hears. Yes. She too seems to have strong will. Listen! Marriage is not in our hands. It is in the hands of the One above. Do you refer to the people in the flat below? I pointed my finger upwards but you ask.. ..if I refer to the people staying below. You may not know Hindi. But can't you understand where I am pointing my finger to? This is a good thing. No matter how much I scold you, you don't mind. Sir, carriage! I will come in the evening, sir. - Okay. Have lunch with us. - No, sir. Are you hesitating because it is hotel food? What can we do? My wife suffers with arthritis. Karthik warned us that he won't tolerate if I let his mother cook. That is why food is being ordered. Food is alright but papad.. You must have seen a papad that breaks.. can it be torn? I will show you. Curd will spread it's smell from Mumbai to Pune. Why I speak about all this.. He does not want his mother to work hard. He loves his mother a lot. That is why we don't mind such things. Doesn't it look silly? No need for hotel food. If he gets married, everything will be alright. But he doesn't want to. Please convince him to get married. I would have prepared the coffee. I thought of giving her tasty coffee. No, that is for my mom, sugarless. Mom! - Is this? Dad! You were missing for a long time. Did you go for a smake? Why do you take trouble? - It's alright. We took an auto while coming. I have to go to station to get my bike. Come on, let us go. Where did your father work? - He is retired. Where did he work? Pastance! Oh, in railways. Worked for 30years as station master. In Vizag. I finished my studies in Andhar University. Nice family and you have a good job. I think your income is also good. Why didn't you marry yet? Sorry! Did I say anything wrong? I didn't ask that on purpose. Before leaving your mom was worried about u and thats why i asked Bye! - Just a moment. What did you ask me? Why didn't you marry till now?

Before that.. I was passed my IPS in 87 and my first posting was as DSP in Vizag. My wife's name is Aruna. It was an arranged marriage. The marriage was done in Anakapally, my wife's hometown. Two months after our marriage.. ..two people were selected.. ..from Andhara Pradesh commado force for training as bomb difusing squad. One is me and the other is Ajay. My close friend. We were a happy family. It is said that every mother-in-law fights with her daughter-in-law. But my mom and my wife.. ..were very friendly. My mom never questions anything unnecessary. And my wife too.. ..used to behave according to my parents likes. She was awsome in everything. I and Arun used to live a jolly life. Hey, Karthik! - Hey, sir! Are you body builder? - Why? How can we get such a body? - Take an inch tape. The tape that tailors use. Chest 40, hips 28.. - Hey! Muscles should be 12 inches like this. And a beautiful girl should be present to praise the physic. Hey, get lost. Isn't that true, body builder? - Yes. Well done! - Do you want to try? Ready? Okay. Come on! - Okay. Goal! Yes! Come on! Come on! Try! Try again. What are you doing? The shopkeeper said that if she eats jack fruit pieces.. ..she will beget a lovely child. I will give this to Karthik. You shouldn't enter his room without knocking the door. Is he a collector that I need permission to go inside? This is fantastic! Sit straight! - Ok! She cuts it very well. Does she do only haircut or shaving as well? Do you want to get it done as well? Did you cut my hair at least once in 45 years? I'm ready. When the want the session? - I don't have faith in you. You might make me bald. Men are ready to die for their wives. It is a fact. Is it enough that children praise? My wife should praise also. Call Aruna! Aruna! What happened to him? - nothing. Kartik lights the crackers with his hand. The kids are looking at him with scared faces. He's trying to light a 1000 cracker chain with his hand. Is he doing that with his hand? He has the courage to do that. Why are you scared? I'm afraid of even smaller things. If he does that, I get even more scared. If he gets into any tussle, I'm afraid that he may get hurt. If he goes on a flight, I'm afraid that there might be an accident. When he dives into a swimming pool.. I remain scared till he comes up I can't bear if anything happens to him. U gave me a big list. Aruna, His job is to defuse bombs. Don't tell me that. I'm afraid even to think. From the day he got the job, I hardly sleep. If you are so scared and told him, he would not have taken this job. You are thinking about me. Do you know how much he loves his job? He's very happy that he got this job. Do you want me to spoil that happiness? what else can I give him? I don't want to take this happiness away from him. That is why I kept my fear to myself. I said this offhand. Don't tell this to him. His happiness is more important than my fear. Aruna, Did you call me? - Yes, come here. I want to introduce my friends to you. He is Kartik, my husband. Assistant Commissioner! He gives me whatever I ask. She is my good friend Renu. She used to play a lot of pranks at college. Don't say that. - Such a good friend? Why did you say that you don't want to attend her marriage? Did she say so? How did you get the heart to say that? You also did not come to my marriage. I said that sarcastically and he's replaying it. I have something for you. Is she the bride really? - Doesn't my face appear like that? Normally a bride appears shy. But your friend doesn't appear to be shy. The groom has all the feelings that you want. Don't worry. Let's go home and I'll tell you. Why not here? Okay. I sometimes act that I am afraid of my wife. Aruna.. I'm coming. Did you call me? I can't wait here till the marriage is over. Sorry. I have to start immediately. I just got the message about some bombs being planted. The inspector came here searching for me. I have to go. What did you say? Some bombs were planted. People could lose their lives My work is to defuse them. Is this something new? I have to go. Tell your friend. I'll call you from there. Ok? What is this? Nothing.. Please go.. You have done a good job. You defuse bombs and save lives of many people. Congratulations. - Thank you very much. Did Ajay defuse the bomb at the railway station? We have not received any information yet. I'm waiting for it. How is Ajay? Sir! Sir.. About Ajay! His life is out of danger. But his left leg was amputated. Don't worry. I'm there to take care. I will return soon. Kartik.. - What is it? Do you like Aruna? Don't you know that I love her? Can you do anything for her? Leave this job right now.. What is the relationship with that? Defusing bombs is a very risky job. Every time you go on the job, she's very scared. It is lucky that I am alive today. She's scared that you too might end up like this. She can't bear this tension. Who told you? She told herself. - She could have told me.. How can she do that? She knows how much you love this job. God saved your life. Do you like me? You didn't hear that? I asked if you love me. Why this new question? Please tell me. Do you like me? I love only you. Why didn't you tell me? - About what? - I will tell you. Your eyes will open wide when you hear what I say. But I'm not there to see them. - Tell me what it is. I resigned from my job. For the sake of my wife. Are you happy? Why don't you say anything? You are crying. Silly! It is hard for you to get that job. You get a lot of fame. You quit the job for my sake? You love me so much? I must see you quickly. I want to embrace you. You can do that later. Tell me when you're coming. I will tell you after reaching there. Renu, move. I'm going to Madras urgently. If I don't go now, my life will have no meaning. If I don't get a ticket I will go standing. Ok, bye! See you! All the best! Help! There is a phone call. Who is speaking? I want to speak to Chitra. Who are you? - who are you? I'm her son. Please call her. There is a phone call. I'm Kartik speaking. - tell me. Look at your hand. What for? No one asked you the time on the way? You left your watch here. Do you want me to come and return it? Why should you make the effort? I will take it when we meet tomorrow morning. One more thing. Tell me. A boy picked up the phone when I called. Yes? - Who is he? - my son. I just asked. Hello! Why did you come to our office? I need to give an advisement in the paper. You came to our office for the first time. Lets have tea together. Get us to 2 cups of tea. I know that you have secrets. But not so much. What do you refer to? - That you are married and have a son. You kept this secret from me. I kept that secret? But you'd not tell me either. But you did not ask. I will slap myself. What is your husband's name? I am Srikanth speaking. - Where does he work? He works in a bank too? in which city? When did you meet your husband for the first time? Why did you hit me? Who hit whom? You act as if you don't know anything. Mind your words, ok? - What do you mean mind my words? Don't pretend like a gentleman. What is the matter, sister? He hit me but acts as if he doesn't know anything Just see his face! - People like him should not be spared. So cheap! - why do you look like that? Don't spare him. Who is he? - That man! Why do you look like that? Did you start ragging in the bus? Madam, you may leave. I will take care of him. Move on now. I want to dash you everyday. Today which guy u going to get into trouble? I go now. Lalita.. you know Chitra who sells saris in instalments? She got some nice saris after a long time. Let's go and check. Please check this design. And see this. - I feel it may be costly. It is not expensive. Thousand rupees! and see this.. Will it lose its colour? - No it won't. You work hard for the bank. She pampers them. Excuse me.. Please give me change for 100 rupees Go to the last counter. For 100 rupees.. You came alone? no police with you? What will you accuse me for? That I am robbing the bank? I did a mistake that day. Very sorry. Is it enough to say sorry? Our elders write the name of God. In the same way you must write.. The word sorry in a full notebook. Shall I give you a sari instead? I don't have the habit of wearing saris. It was always pant and shirt. You laughed. Tell me about your husband. I'm not yet married. Shall we get married then? Just a minute.. We will not get married. Will you share a cup of coffee with me? Why did you get shocked? You get shocked when I propose marriage. You're shocked when I talk about coffee. You keep getting shocked always. Does your father work in the Electricity Board? Yes? - Is this 24, Balaji street? You enter the house and asked the address. - Just confirming. There is a lady who sells saris - she's my sister. I am Sreekanth. I work in the Indian bank. Your sister comes to our bank to sell saris. When she came yesterday she said she wanted a ticket for the drama. Give me hundred rupees. Wait a minute. Chitra, Did you ask for a drama ticket? Someone came here and asks for hundred rupees. Hello! You asked for a ticket to the dance drama. I came to give it. Brother, I did not ask anyone for a ticket. You actually did. Otherwise why would I come this far with this ticket? Actually it is a dance drama. I said that it is a charity show for an orphanage. She asked me to bring the ticket. When I brought it she denies it. Check this ad in the paper. If there is an ad in the paper, does it mean that I asked for the ticket? She says that she doesn't know you and did not ask for the ticket. You may leave. She only said that she didn't ask for the ticket. She did not say she doesn't know me. Don't you know me? I know you. But it is a lie that I asked for the ticket. Let's suppose it is a lie. Who is going to gain from that? It is the orphans. The hundred rupees will go straight to the orphanage. You too take a ticket. I will get 200 rupees. Greetings.. Is it your sister-in-law? To take a ticket also. I will get 300 rupees. 30 kids will have a nice meal for a day. I'm asking for charity. Is that wrong? You want us to take the tickets. We will take later. When will you take? Please come tomorrow evening. - Thank you. I take your leave. - Tell me why you actually came. I came to sell the tickets. - I don't believe that. 'Hello, one minute! good morning' 'I want to say something' 'Get lost!' Have you lost your mind? That is the proprietor's photo. Why do you put that here? Remove them. Excuse me! - Where is the manager's room? You want to see the room or the manager? You must be the manager. When will the show be over? At 9.30 It is one more hour. I have some urgent work. There will be about 1000 people inside. But I want to call out only three. I can open the door and shout. But all will get disturbed. Is there any other way that we can call only those three out? 'Try this' 'Why do you kiss a man?' 'You only asked me to embrace and give a kiss - when did I say that' 'That is the meaning of what you said' Hello! - Hello! Why did you call us outside? You said you will take drama tickets Who said so? - your wife did. Will you make us come out like this? You said you will take in the evening. I went to your house. The old lady said that you came to this movie. So I came here. Did you come to the theatre only for donation tickets? What a doubt? I came to give the tickets. I don't believe. Hello, I am Sreekanth. I am a volunteer of Sivananda ashram. It is an organisation that serves orphans. This is our donation box. Your shop is very famous in the city. It will be helpful if people donate even small amounts. I want your permission to keep it here. Definitely! - thank you. It is an organisation for orphans. There are more than 700 kids. We collect donations to meet their expenses. We depend mainly on public contributions. That is why we put donation boxes in prominent public places like here. Thanks for considering my request. I will come every month for the collection. Thank you. Let me be the first person to give. Do you work at the Sivananda ashram? No. I am a bank employee. That is for my livelihood. This is to serve society. Wish you all the best. - Thank you. Hello.. Are you shocked again? What is the name of that ashram? You want to see it? 'The entire world is within you O lord' 'That is the Universal God' 'He is the root cause' 'He is the one all encompassing' 'He is everything' 'The creator' 'I pray to the Lord' 'O lord Vishnu' They are more than 750. No one knows when and to whom they were born. One feel sad to hear each one's story. Parents get irritated at their own children sometimes. But here they are taken care of with love. Great! I'm coming here since about six years. Rajaram who runs this place, is a great guy. I was inspired after seeing him. That I too must do some service. Don't think that it is at the level of Mother Teresa. It is just part-time work. It is not a small thing to serve an ashram. You must have a very kind heart to do social service at this age. Thanks for praising me. I have now many problems for my marriage. What do you mean? I'm not alone.. Why so? - I have a son. Are you shocked again? It is not my own son. I saw many orphans in that ashram. I have a desire to adopt one of them. I got three proposals but the girls ran away when I spoke of adopted son. My parents are angry about my desire. Is it wrong to adopt someone? You have tears in your eyes. It is ok. 'This is a great moment' 'The bubbly clouds have come here' 'Shall I wait for the first light when the lotus blooms' 'The bubbly clouds have come here' 'Shall I wait for the first light when the lotus blooms' 'The heart shines bright' 'It remembers something' 'The heart remembers something and shines bright' 'I'm breathless.. I never experienced this feeling before' 'The bubbly clouds have come here' 'Shall I wait for the first light when the lotus blooms' 'Light has made friendship with the pupil' 'The world has come to a standstill to see us' 'Light has made friendship with the pupil' 'The world has come to a standstill to see us' 'The bubbly clouds have come here' 'Shall I wait for the first light when the lotus blooms' 'The moon shines bright and provides cool moonlight' 'The moon shines bright and provides cool moonlight' 'The moon shines bright and provides cool moonlight' 'The moon shines bright and provides cool moonlight' 'Who does the heart refer to' 'Who does the heart refer to' 'It is experiencing pangs of love separation' 'The bubbly clouds have come here' 'Shall I wait for the first light when the lotus blooms' Chitra! Sreekanth's mother has come. Come quickly. Put vermilion and come. Why did you stand there? Come in. Greetings. Please come in. Chitra, put that away. Please come in. - please come. Please take a seat. I did not come to discuss about this match at ease. Our son liked her. But I don't want this marriage to happen. You will like me. That is not the issue. You might be a good girl. But I don't want you to be my daughter-in-law. I don't speak without reason. How will you drink coffee? I drink it without the cup touching my lips. You may be using onion and garlic in your recipes. I don't do that. On Saturdays I fast. I don't do anything without praying to Tulasi first. Everything must be done the traditional way. Our customs are different than yours. My father is a very traditional man. How can I change, being born into that family? The two poles don't meet. This marriage can't happen. The marriage band! Tie her the nuptial knot. 'Sanskrit Chant' What is this? My marriage did not happen like for other girls. You refer to the temple marriage? Your parents not come to bless us. It would have been good if they came to bless us. It is their blessings that you want. What are you saying? Yes, I'm married Chitra. When? - just now. We got married in the temple. To did not come to the marriage. I called to take your blessings over phone. Please call mother. Your mother got bedridden due to anxiety about you. If she learns about your marriage.. She will surely die. My mother suffers from asthma. It is winter season.. And there is snow fall. Mother is serious. Wasn't she taken to the hospital? She's at home. She doesn't want to go to hospital. How is mother doing now? - Go and meet her. Don't misunderstand me. - Why did you come here? Mother, open the door. Mother, please. Go away from here. Consider your mother dead. Don't ever come to my home. Please understand me. Explain to her, father. Why are you adamant? - Mother! Tell him to go away from here. I don't want to see his face. Why won't mother listened to me? - Wait. Listen to what I say and open the door. Don't speak to him. Tell him to go away from here. How is mother-in-law? - She did not even see my face. When I went she closed the door and did not come out. She did not speak one word to me. I did not expect her to react like this at our marriage. Are you speaking from your home? I could not stay there even for half an hour. I'm calling from Madras. I will be catching the train shortly. I feel sad about mother. It is all because of me. No.. It is I who loved you. I doubt whether you love me or not. Do you love me? Why is there no reply? I nodded. My marital life started like a dream but ended like a story. After he died I did not come out for one year. Because my husband died while in service.. I got a letter from the bank offering me his job. My brother got a job in Singapore at the same time. Brother said he won't leave me alone. I did not want to be a burden on anyone. So I asked my brother to go. What happened next.. Two years ago.. I was transferred to Bombay. The boy.. What could I do in memory of such a great husband? That is why as per his wish.. I adopted a child from Sivananda ashram and named him Siva. You asked me why I came to your office. I came to give an ad. Obituary! It is his fifth death anniversary tomorrow. Go and pay the bill today. Otherwise we can't give the check tomorrow. It will be a problem. Do you have the money or shall I give? I have the money but please send it to mother-in-law. I will take care of mother-in-law. Listen to me first. You go and pay the bill. I will go to office. Greetings. I am Vidya's husband. You may not have seen me. I used to stay in Ahmedabad. I closed my textile mill and came to Mumbai. I think it is time for you to go to bank. Please go. Please come to our home when you find the time. Do you wonder how I speak Telugu? My father's business is in Hyderabad. I was raised and educated there. I take your leave. - Greetings! Mother.. The young guest is coming to our house tonight. Is it your friend Manikyam? He has such a long beard.. Is he young? Why are you sleeping like that? I have back pain. Whom did you invite? A lady called Chitra came to our house once. She has to go to Nagpur for bank training. She was worried where to leave her child. I told her to leave him here. She will be coming here shortly with the kid. What are you saying? Did Chitra get married? What is the need to leave the kid here? Her husband died. Her husband and Aruna died in the same train accident. Not only that. The boy doesn't know that she adopted him. You must not tell him. If she comes asked her to sit. I will take my bath and come. Hey! - Careful! He will keep trying. Please go, I will take care of him. Don't feel sad.. He will cry for some time and calm down. I'm anxious about your parents. - They won't cry! He will annoy them. He is mischievous. - More than me?! You have this trouble because of me. - This is not a trouble. Karthik told me about you. It is all the play of destiny. Mother! - Ok.. - I take your leave. Have a safe journey! - thank you. Take this.. It seems you like this. Come, let's go to bed. You will catch cold if you stand outside. Your granny will come. She made the bed ready. Come and sleep. I don't want to sleep. He will not come if you call. He will come if Kartik calls. I won't come even if anyone calls. Mother, I got some ice cream and put it in the fridge. Where is it? Father may eat it. It is not for us. Who is it for? It is for an important person. Look here. You should not cry. ok? You are a good boy. - I want my mother. When will she return? She will return in 2 days. What do you want? Ice cream, KitKat, Polo? Do you want a cold drink? Do you want sketch pencils? Tell me what you want. I want to get drenched in the rain. Can you bring that? A very good question! He wants rain. Is that ice cream that you can bring from a shop? If we pray to God, he will send down rain. - That is true. Let us all pray to God. All of you close your eyes and pray. Tomorrow it will rain and you can get drenched. Let's sleep now. So you won't come. Mother, come let's go. - But he is not coming. After some time two ghosts will come. He will play with them happily. What is it? Let's go to sleep. 'O boy, The spark in the heart is flaring up' 'O girl, The spark in the heart is flaring up; 'The heart got entangled' 'Stop fire with fire like you take a thorn with another thorn' 'Stop fire with fire like you take a thorn with another thorn' 'The fire of love must be ignited in my eyes' 'Stop fire with fire like you take a thorn with another thorn' 'Our bodies must be teased in this manner' 'The spark in the heart' 'A man considers woman for his pleasure' 'When bodies unite it is a moment of exhilaration' 'All the senses are set on fire' 'My desire is hot and your beauty matchless..

Convert this fire into a blaze' 'The spark in the heart' Will you come again for the holidays? - Go safely. I take your life. Bye, grandpa and grandma. Get in. Kartik, We will go to that hotel which serves our traditional food. Why are you so scared of carriage meals? What else can we do? The hotel food won't come to our home for some more days. Why? The boy who brings the food suffered an accident. What happened to him? - He was bringing the carriage. Nothing happened to the boy. - He is always sarcastic. Kartik, Don't you find us troublesome? Let me explain to him. We are destined to eat hotel food. You won't make your mother cook. That may be right too. If she stands in the kitchen for two minutes.. ..you will have to serve her rest of the day. It is more than five years since your wife died. You won't agree to marry again. You go to work from 10 to 5 everyday. What can we say about it? If it is my duty, there is nothing to say. You will call is 5 to 6 times. You faced a lot of hardship due to us. I feel sad to see your condition. Do one thing. Take a separate room. You can come and go as you want. Then you can put us in an old age home. All problems will be solved. Why are you talking like mad people? Do you want me to shunt you to an old age home and enjoy myself? You are my responsibility and not my burden. If you say that again I will stop smiling also. Wait. No question of old age home. He said that to make you agree for marrying again. My good boy. Marry again. I heard some sound and came running. Please call me if needed. I'm your neighbour. I will come to help any time. My wife is not at home. She went to her hometown.. If anything.. Kartik sir.. How are you? - fine! - Hello! Where are you going so fast? - To the railway station. We also are going there. Let us go together. How are your parents? - They are fine thanks to hotel food. You are a photographer, right? - Yes! Do you do fashion photography? No.. How about nature? Kartik sir.. You are waste just like my mother. I asked her for a bat but she won't buy. What will you give me if I buy for you? - I will beat you with the bat. I said that for fun. Buy me a bat first and then see. I will fill your face with kisses. - All that for buying you a bat! Kartik sir.. Where is mother? I'm a young boy but you're a grown-up. Go and bring mother carefully. Go now. Mother is grown up but can't take care of herself. Siva, We should not talk with elders like that. Mother, you are grown up. Is it proper for you to cheat a small kid? Why do you take me straight to the railway station.. ..without buying the ice cream? Why are you running? The phone.. - So what? I called up Chitra's bank. She was not there and was not at home also. I gave a message that she should call me. I thought that she might have called. - Call her. They don't have a phone in their house. She will call back. Will you take a bath or just wipe yourself? Please marry Kartik. It will be surprising if I say this suddenly. If you marry him.. Your taking care of Siva.. And his taking care of us, it will solve both issues. And, Me and my wife.. ..Kartik, you and the small boy.. ..We all will be one family. It will be great. You both are destined to come together. Why else would your husband and his wife die in the same accident? Why did you both have to meet in Mumbai? It is god that enacts all this. I know that he wants to marry you. Do you like that? You need not reply now. Think it over with a calm mind. I don't have the desire to marry again. My point is.. Shall I call the auto? If I spoke anything that hurt you, please forgive me. You must forgive me. Don't keep anything in your heart. I take your leave. Sorry, Kartik. It all got spoilt because of me. If you asked her, she might have consented. I acted in haste. Once she has decided not to marry again.. Doesn't matter who speaks to her. If I asked and if she hesitates.. You avoided all that. Don't feel sad. Father.. Let's go. One minute. I think you don't like to see my face. I call you to say that I know what is on your mind. I won't come to meet u also. Don't worry. Please come. Please sit.. Just five minutes. Kartik sir.. You stopped coming. Did you forget me? Nothing like that. Do you know how to ride a cycle? I learnt to ride a cycle first and then a bike. I bought a new cycle. Street Cat! - very good. Get ready. - She Don't know how to ride a cycle. Will you teach? Teach whom? - I'm talking about me and not mother. Ok.. - When? I will come sometime. You say that but will not come. Tell me when you will come. It is getting late for school. - I know it. Come! You did not tell me when you will come. - I will come tomorrow. You say that now but won't turn up later. Don't cry. Start cutting. Yesterday , Chitra's neighbour tried to harrass her!... Don't let her know that I know about it. I will do something to solve this problem. 'It is very important to control your anger.' 'High emotions cause trouble.' 'It is true that these blasts have cut through our souls.' 'Many of our people were killed' - Come! What's this.. 'But to take a wrong step out of anger' 'It is not advisable' 'Those who are responsible for these blasts' 'We will punish them' 'We will identify our enemies' 'At the proper time' 'They will be given proper punishment' 'It is important that all of us maintain peace' 'Peace' 'Peace' 'Peace' 'Let him provoke against me' 'What make difference?' 'You do your work peacefully.' 'Not to worry I'm with you.' 'Every step romove darkness your knowledge.' Explain to everyones. Specially youngster to keep control himself. You shall never molest women. Ok? My child..Are u fine? Why are you like that? what happened? I want to speak to you. I have some problem and came to you. I am ill at heart. A neighbour tried to molest me. I lost interest in life after that. You don't take my advice at all. Get married again. It is not wrong. You must do that for your adopted son. You dedicated your life for your husband's ideals. What happened? he died in an accident. Will u be in a hardship till the end for that? Why don't you change your decision? Do you think it will mean betraying your husband? If your husband loves you, do you think he wants to see you suffer? In the past, when husband died the wife too used to die. It was called wife's self immolation. Don't you think that now that kind of thing is madness? What you are doing now is just like that. Where a dead person is buried, flowers will grow next morning. You must have seen that. Why I tell you is.. We need not spoil our future because someone close has died. Death is not the end. Think about marrying again. Hope you'll consider that. I know that my husband is a bad man. But this bad.. I did not know. Please forgive me. The guy not just vacating the house.. He is leaving Mumbai altogether. We have a similar problem near our home. Let's go and solve it. Do you remember Rakesh marriage? Our entire staff has decided to go together. Shall I tell them to pick you up? It will be late by the time Siva comes from school. I will come directly. The marriage is tomorrow, right? - Yes. I forgot. Siva, it is your mother. Did you go to play cricket? Yes. You are searching for someone to teach you how to ride a cycle. An auntie who works with me said that she will bring her husband. Don't go anywhere. Bye! We were working together since three years. Yes.. - Is that so? Where is he going? Siva, Why did you close the door and go inside? come out. Have your drinks. My colleague brought her husband to teach you to ride a cycle. He will come right away. Should not behave like this before them. Did I ask you to bring him? I will not learn from him. Why? - I don't like him. Will you come out or not? He is feeling shy since you are new to him. We will meet again. - Bye, thank you. You're getting adamant by the day. What is your problem and learning from him? I will learn only from Kartik sir. Siva, come here. Siva! Come close. Do you want to learn it only from Kartik sir? What is the reason? Do you like him so much? When you met him in the saloon and told him that he forgot you. Why did you ask? Because I like him. Why? - I don't know. But I like him. Shall we all stay in one home? What do you mean by 'we'? You.. me.. Kartik sir.. Grandpa and grandma.. Yes! 'I kept standing here waiting for you' 'I attempt to win over your patience.. Is it possible' 'I kept standing here waiting for you' 'I attempt to win over your patience..

Is it possible' 'Love is magical' 'It is a magical feeling' It is a magical feeling' Hello! - This is Chitra speaking. What is it? I want to talk to you. Say it in the phone. No, I want to talk to you directly. Will you come to the bank tomorrow? No, I have another assignment tomorrow morning. We can meet in the evening if you want to. Okay. Where? - You tell me. Near railway station at Juhu. Okay. - You will come, don't you? Enough! Items are very tasty. Mom! I don't understand this problem. When will he sleep? I want to talk about an important matter with you. That is why I came here. I blamed you for the death of my son and was angry with you. Before his death my husband told me the truth. Then only I understood my mistake. Your father-in-law too has passed away now. Just became he married you even after I said no.. ..I didn't bless him even by the phone. He came to see me when I was ill. I sent him away without even looking at his face. If I allowed him to see me that day.. ..he would have stayed at the house that night. He wouldn't have travelled by that train and met with the accident. He died. My son died because of me. - Calm down. It was my mistake. My mistake! Caste and religion! Life is important than everything. I understood the truth after losing my son. I searched everywhere for you. I searched every bank. I was able to meet you now. For me this city is a priligrimage. People visit Tirupati or Srirangam to see the God. But I came to Mumbai. What are you saying? - Yes. Who is God? The person who can forgive others and help even.. ..the one who caused harm to them cannot be called God. What did I do? I told you that you cannot marry my son whom you loved. But you adopted a child and raising him.. ..and living with the ideals of my son. Instead of throwing me out of the house.. ..you invited me in and served food with love. You are really the God. My son didn't have the pleassure of living with such a wife. Finished. Even now I came to ask you a favor. Would you do that? I made a mistake and standing in front of you as a culprit. To atone my mistake I want.. ..keep you and your child with me. Will you come to my place with me? I ordered you both not to come to our house. If you come now you will have forgiven me. Will you come? I lost my child and also my husband. I became an orphan. Since I rejected you in the past.. ..don't reject me now. I pray to you. Don't leave me as an orphan, Chitra. Please forgive me. What is it, dad? Is it a stone? My teeth broke. This hotel food will break all my teeth. Give me the papad. I will tear it for mother. Fold it nicely and then tear it. No please! - Why is that? Do you want to stitch it back again? What is the matter, mom? Chitra left the city. That is why your mom is sad. She asked you to meet her to talk about something. We thought it is some good news. But she left this city forever. Mom! Chitra leaving this city is not important to me. Please don't worry about it. What I care the most is your helath. You are a good guy. God is really stone hearted. She should have informed you before leaving. Isn't that right, Mr. Karthik? Drink slowly. - Enough. Is it over? Where are your books? Give me the bag. - Here. Wait! I am coming. Hey, Shiva! Don't run. Hold this. That's right. There were bomb explosions in six main places in Mumbai. Including the buildings of Indian express and reserve bank.. ..there were explosions at different places in the city. Among them Indian express building sustained a lot of damage. The first explosion happened in the first floor of this building. Hello! Mumbai's India express office? I am calling from Ooty. Do you know Telugu? What is it? I saw the new about explosions in the TV. The first bomb explosion of in our ad section, madam. I hope everyone is safe. Two people are in serious condition. Two people serious?! What about Mr. Karthik.. Are you talking about photo editor? He is.. He is alright. Nothing happened to him. Thank you! I don't think that I will come home this time. I might die here only. Who is going to stay forever. I will also die someday. Bring the news of Karthik's marriage when you come to me. Sir! We are going to Ooty today evening. We have to write a cover story about Wellington military school there. I have the camera and film. I will take any number of photos. Not only photos, you are the one who is going to interview them. Sir! My cousin is coming to Mumbai for the first time. I want to show her the city. She is very beautiful unlike my wife. I will also prepare a cover story by the time you come back. Show me your feet! - Please stop it, sir. I will do whatever you ask me to. Please do me this favor. See you! Mother-in-law! We can leave in a couple of minutes. What is the time? 7.30 madam. Mother-in-law! Let us go. I will pay the bill and come. You.. I was writing an artical about Wellington military college. I came to Ooty to meet the commondos and take their interviews. Mother-in-law! He is Mr. Karthik. He works in Indian express, Mumbai. She is my mother-in-law. Greetings, madam. - Greetings! Just now I asked him to tell the time. How are you? How is Shiva? I take your leave, madam. Okay. - See you! - Okay. Did you take everything? Let us go. The person who spoke with us now.. His wife died in a train accident. The same train in which your son died. Mr. Karthik! Our house is nearby. Please come there. No, actually I have work. If not today you can come for lunch tomorrow. I have to interview six people tomorrow. I have to find their addresses and visit there. Everyone lives in different places. I don't have much time. But I will definitely pay a visit next time. I heard that your wife too died in the same accident that took away my son. Chitra told me. You should definitely come next time. Yes. We take your leave. - Okay. Shiva! Karthik sir came to Ooty. He is coming to our house to see you. When?! Tomorrow afternoon for lunch. - Yeah! Granny! I too learned to ride the bicycle leaving the handle just like him. Rickshaw man and Aditya uncle were surprised to see that. Tomorrow Karthik sir is coming to our house. When we were in Mumbai I have asked him many times.. ..to teach me how to ride a bicycle. But he didn't teach me. Tomorrow when he comes.. ..he will be surprised to see me riding it without holding the handle. I will be meeting him at this time tomorrow. Yes! Yes! Chitra! Chitra come here once. - What is it, mother-in-law? See what your son has done. Madam! Madam! Please! One minute, madamd! I cannot attend table tennis practice today. I have to go home urgently. - Why? Karthik sir is coming. Who is he? Do you like him that much? I like him a lot. You will not be in the school team. Is that alright? Just one day. Please! How can I allow? You only tell me. Do you want school team or house? House! - Shiva! You will be in school team. Don't forget to come for practice tomorrow. The staff College was started by the British.. ..in the early part of last century. Here we give training to majors. And after training they are posted as lieutenant colonels. It is interesting to know that the Lawrence School was.. ..started for the children of army officers. What is the time of the train Karthik sir is catching, granny? One o'clock. Uncle! What is the time now? - 11 o'clock. Still two hours left. I would have had my TT practice. Hello! - Please come. I thought of going to the station directly. That is why I vacated the room. - Oh, give it to me. It's okay. - It's alright. Give me. You can come in like that. Please sit down. Shiva? Mother-in-law went to bring him from school. They will be here in a moment. Did your mother-in-law cook this? No, I did. But don't worry. It will taste like food for sure. It has to be. I am not joking. I didn't eat anything since morning. I never tasted the food you cook. I am about to eat it for the first time. Do you still have account in the bank I worked at Mumbai? Or did you close it? How can I close that? Account is still there but I will not close it. If I don't say it now, then I can never say it. Your father came to me to talk about our marriage once. I told him that I am not interested. After that we didn't meet. After that I called you one day to speak about an important matter.. ..and asked you to come to the station. Should I tell you what it was about? To give my consent to our marriage. But unexpectedly my mother-in-law came to my house. She said that she is alone and have no one to take care of her. After listening to her.. ..I thought that it is correct to remain single like this. I have decided to be with her forever and quit my job. I should have told you before leaving. But i couldn't dare to do that. How long did you wait for me? Actually.. it's alright. I cried in my heart for many days for making u wait at the station without informing u. You wouldn't have asked anything even if I don't say it now because u are such a good man Uncle! Karthik sir might have reached by now. Tell me, granny. I have to catch the train. I must go to the office tomorrow. - Have your lunch and go. No, I will be late. You didn't eat the food I cooked. I thought you will eat it today. Everything we hope for do not happen. This too is like that. I have to catch the train. Tell your mother-in-law not to misunderstand. I will be going now. Oh, I am sorry! I forgot. Give this to Shiva. Shiva was eagerly waiting for you. All this was done by him. Specially for you. You will fall down. Slowly! Mom! Did he go already? Or didn't he come? He came and waited for you. But he was getting late to catch the train, so he left. He asked me to give you this. What is this? - O God! I never saw such traffic in this city. I wanted to show these merit cards to Karthik sir. I skipped table tennis practice to see him. Everything is waste. Mom! Shiva! Don't cry. Calm down. Don't cry. I wanted to show him how I ride bicycle without holding the handle. But he left without seeing that. He would have stayed back if he loves me. Nothing like that. He loves you a lot. That is why he brought you present. He said he will come to Ooty again. Then he will come here. Or we can go to Mumbai.. ..and visit his house. I'll take you there. Okay? You always say that but never do. What did you tell me the other day? You, me, granny, grandpa.. ..and Karthik sir can live in the same house. - Shiva! You forgot everything when grandma came to our house. No. - I won't believe you no matter what you say. Karthik sir! Karthik sir! Yes! Yes! Now tell me. Did you like this? Yes. - It has been long since I saw you. Shiva! You go to your mother. My child! At least you could have told me. If he didn't speak.. ..I would have made a big mistake again. I have troubled Chitra all these days by keeping her away. Now I am troubling her by asking her to stay with me. Without thinking that she needs the support of nice guy like you.. ..I was thinking selfishly about myself. You both are younger than me. You thought with presence of mind.. ..and with great sense of responsibility. May be she still thinks that I am bound to my old principles. She didn't say anything about this matter. But I have changed completely. I did a lot of injustice to Chitra. But still she takes care of me with a lot of affection. She is a nice girl. I want you two to marry. For my sake.. look at that kid.. For him. Please marry her. Will you? Mom!
