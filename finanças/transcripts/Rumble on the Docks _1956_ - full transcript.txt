(tugboat whistling) (train rumbling nearby) (tin can clattering) (dramatic music) - [Blonde Stomper] She's a clay pigeon. - All right, take it easy. (ship's horn blowing) - Hey, sis? - Hmm? - You kiddin' about what you told Ma? You gonna come back to the house to stay? - Ma's gotta let me stand on my own two feet. - Yeah. But she always says that the waterfront's no place for a girl to grow up. I don't get it. We got lotsa girls in my class at P.S. 6. Do you think she just means older girls like you? - Ma can mean a lot of things. Just the same, she needs help here. And so do you. - Me? - You wanna spend the rest of your life hanging out on street corners like that Jimmy Smigelski and the rest of those hoodlums? - Hoodlums? Della, Jimmy's an Aceman. He's the head of the Diggers. Boy, you say things like that you better go back and stay with Aunt Mary. - Do you know what? The Diggers are nothing but a gang. Gangsters, that's what they'll all grow up to be. - What do you say, Tony, what do you say? - Okay, come on. - I'm not gonna let you be another Jimmy Smigelski. - [Tony] Oh, boy, this waterfront's looking better every day. - Hey, you guys are Stompers. You're over the line. This ain't your territory. - Yeah. Hey, Tony. You tell her all the trouble we had following her down here. - Oh, I'll tell her. - Beat it! - I ain't goin' no place! - You leave him alone! - Come on, take a walk with me. - Now, you leave her alone! - Hey, you're gonna get hurt! - Poochie! Let go of me! Poochie! OW! Poochie! Ow, ow! Poochie! (dramatic music) - Hey, Poochie's running like the cops are after him. (dramatic music) - Jimmy, they got Della! The Stompers. - Where? - The docks. It's Tony Lightning and Gil Danco. - You two guys cut through the alley, see if any more Stompers are around. Come on, Chuck. - Let go! (shouts) Let me out of here! Police'll get you! - What's the matter, baby doll? Is it just because we're Stompers? - You wouldn't act this way if we was Diggers, huh? - Let go of me! - Hey, what do you know, she's really mad. Hey, Tony, why don't you two kiss and make up, huh? - No! No! (dramatic music) - Poochie, where are they? - In the door! - [Della] Oh! - Diggers! (thrilling music) - [Jimmy] You stinkin' crow! (dramatic music) - You're gonna get a rumble for this. A rumble you ain't never gonna forget! (thrilling music) (Della cries) - [Jimmy] They hurt you? - I'm all right. I'll stop crying in a minute. - Here. You pick up guys like that you had it comin'. - Pick them up? We didn't even see them! Poochie and I were just standing there talking. - Yeah, minding our own business. You do me a favor, huh, Jimmy? - What? - Walk Della home. - No, I'll be all right. - Just in case. A regular Samson. You know judo or something? - I'll take her, I'll take her. - Come on, Pooch, let's go. - Yeah. - You comin'? - I'm all messy. - Oh, come on, will ya? - You're gonna rumble with the Stompers, aren't you? That means a fight. - Could be. - I don't want you to fight because of me. Is that the only way you know how to settle things? - Look, if we let 'em get away with it once, they'll be taking potshots at every chick in the neighborhood. - I don't believe it. You make it sound like it's some kind of uncivilized place. - Brother, have you been away a long time. (ship's horn blowing nearby) How long? - Four years. - What have you been doing? - Living with my aunt. Going to school in New Jersey. Pompton Lakes. - Hey, that's where Joe Louis used to train. Why'd you come back to this broken down place for? - Ma's kind of sick. Somebody has to take care of Poochie. - Poochie's doing all right. - He talks about you. He wants to be like you. - So what? - So if he were your brother would you want him to be like you? - What's the beef? - You're getting angry. All that fighting, rumbles. There's no sense to it, no brains. Five years from now what will it all amount to? I'm sorry. I don't want you to be angry. I owe you an awful lot. - Oh yeah? You got a great way of payin' off. - You didn't have to come and help me. It was a fine and noble thing. - A fine and noble thing? What kinda books you been reading? - I just want to thank you. - So you thanked me. - I'd like you and your friends to come to the Settlement House dance tonight. Let's see, I can afford to buy you 10 tickets. - You want to buy the guys tickets? - Mm-hmm, 10 Diggers. I don't know how many members you have, but that's all the money I have. - No dame's buying me tickets there. - All right, then you can take me and I'll give the tickets to the rest of the boys. - You think you can stall the rumble just like that, huh? - I'd be very honored if you'd escort me. - What are you trying to do, sound like Park Avenue or something? (ship's horn blowing) - Please? - Okay, what time should I pick you up? - 8:30 would be fine. - You never got to see Joe Louis work out, did you? - Mm-mm. But my uncle says they have a pair of his training gloves in a saloon in Pompton Junction. - Yeah, no kidding? - Here you go, Jimmy. - Well, what happened when you took her home, huh, Jimmy? She give you a medal or something? - Less lip. - Joe Brindo's car. - Yeah. Hey, man, it looks like he's going to stop here. - I knew your old man shoulda kept his kisser shut. (tense music) That ain't good when Joe Brindo himself comes down here. - Yeah, not with that goon Frank Mangus. - Your old man's sure been asking for it. Just like he does with everyone. (bottles clink) (dramatic music) - I mean, it just isn't good sense not to listen to reason. We've got 350 longshoremen in our local now, that's much more than when you were working on the docks. That means lots of paperwork to be done, lots of material to be printed up. Look, I've got an idea. We gotta have it done by some printer. Why not you? - Yeah, it means 3000 dollars a year, Pete. You can't afford to pass that up. - Get out. I don't take those kind of bribes. If I have to make a living that way I'd rather steal. - You know, Frank was just saying to me yesterday don't bother talking to Pete. Sue him for libel, that'll stop him from smearing you in that little paper he gets up. But I said, "No, Frank. "Let me talk to Pete. "A libel suit could cost him every dime he's got, "hurt him bad." I said, "No, let me try to patch things up with Pete..." - I said get out. Come on, Frank, we're wasting our time. Hi, Jimmy boy. - Hello, Mr. Brindo. Pa. Pa, you passed up 3000 bucks a year. We coulda moved to a better place! Maybe Ma'd feel better. - Nobody asked you. - You owe it to Ma. - Owe it? You want me to take Joe Brindo's filthy money? Money with blood on it? Money that bought me my broken back? You think I owe that to anyone? This! This is what I owe! - Peter! In the name of heaven! What are you trying to do? Break his back the way yours is broken? - Anna! - If he ever hits you with that cane, Ma, you let me know. - You wouldn't hit me, too. - You heard. You heard what he said about Brindo. - You can't expect him to know everything. He's a boy. - Yes, a boy. With the muscles of a man. With strong hands and a straight back. He would work for Brindo. But for nothing good. - All his life you hate him. - Hate him? - Maybe not here, but here. That's where you hate him. - You're a fool, Anna, like him. - To earn money when he was born, you became a longshoreman. Always you think you could have been something better. So you blame him. You blame him for that. For the accident... - That was no accident! - All right, all right, so those men did it to you. You tried to be bigger than the whole local. - I was fighting for what was right. I am still fighting for what is right. - By fighting Jimmy?

With music like this you have to move around so much it's hard to do any talking. - Listen, I know I can't dance. - Oh, Jimmy, I didn't mean that. I just meant, well, gee, I like to talk to people. You learn things. I used to like talking with my father. - Yeah? - He always told me you are what you think. - Mine thinks I have nothing up here but a set of bongos. - Oh, I'm sure he doesn't.

Or maybe Della knows the right things to say to you. - We'd like a sandwich, please, Mr. Kevlin. - Sure, help yourselves, kids, that's what it's here for. - Thank you. - What are you, running for alderman or something? - Not me. Still using the telescope? - Sometimes. - Where is it? - On his roof. - He gave it to me. - Can I use it? - Help yourself. (traffic bustling nearby) - [Tony] How do you like that? They haven't even posted a lookout. - [Gil] They must figure if they ain't gonna rumble with us on the docks there ain't even gonna be a rumble. - [Tony] And them just dancing away in their nice, clean clothes. All right, come on, let's mark 'em up. (crowd chattering) - Stompers! Stompers! (crowd exclaiming) (thrilling music) Come on! (thrilling music) - Ha! Next! Which one? (thrilling music) - Tony! Tony, he's got a shiv and he slashed me. - What's the matter, you Diggers too chicken to fight without shivs, huh? (thrilling music) - What are you doin'? Man, they're gonna kill me! - No guns, no shivs! (blaring sirens approaching) Diggers, break it up! Cops! (dramatic music) (siren blaring) - Hey, Jimmy. You're in trouble, huh? - What are you doing? - Just keep your mouth shut, huh? You kids better get off the street. Come on, I'll drop you off wherever you want to go. - No, thanks, I can walk... - No trouble, I'll drop you. - I can walk! - Not many guys turn down a ride with Joe Brindo. - His uncle's Ferdinand Marchesi. - Oh, and he thinks his uncle's got a chance to start a local down here, huh? Well, there's not a chance. Funny you don't feel the same way, kid. - I got no kicks coming with you, Mr. Brindo. - How'd you like to come up to my place an hour or two till the heat's off, huh? - Sure. - Good boy. Get in, you can drive my car. Get in, Frank. (motor revs) - You know, Joe... - Yeah? - I don't understand you. What's with the Smigelski kid anyway? What'd you bring him down here for? - You never know, we might be able to use him. Hey, you feel better? - Yeah. - Here, sit down. - I'll see you later, Joey. - Yeah, sure. Help yourself to the cream and sugar. You know, I don't get your old man at all. He squawks about the shape up, that's the only way longshoremen have ever been hired, and about kickbacks. You see, kid, I run a local. That money goes into a very special fund just for the longshoremen. How's your coffee? - Fine. - Here, have a cigarette. It'd be different if he was attacking the shipping company, but he's gunning for the very guys who protect those working stiffs. He had an accident once and he thinks I was responsible for it. Jimmy, do you think I'd do something like that to anybody? - There was never any proof of it. - The cops investigated it. They found out it was caused by a faulty loading ceiling. Nobody was to blame. Jimmy, how'd you like to go places in the labor game someday, huh? - Sure, I'd like it. - I could teach you everything you have to know. You see, I got no kid of my own. I never had time to get married, I guess. (telephone rings) (dramatic music) Excuse me. (telephone rings) Hello. (dramatic music) What do you mean you couldn't get in? It was an open meeting, wasn't it? Well, how many guys were there? Well, get all their names. I want those names in my office tomorrow, you understand? (slams receiver) Seems like there was some kind of meeting at your father's store. You got any idea what it's all about? - No, I don't know. - I'll drive you home. Okay? - Sure. (dramatic music) - Jimmy. - Yeah? - Jimmy, I... There's blood on your shirt. The police were here. - So what? - Jimmy, I told you, if you get into any more of those fights I'm going to... - Why don't you get me arrested? Then I'd be out of your hair. - Are all the kids like this? Why do they always fight and almost kill each other? - You fight, Pete. - Yeah, for something I believe in. - Yeah, maybe that's the trouble. They have nothing to believe in. You coulda told him you knew the fight wasn't his fault. - Yes, yes, that's what you say. I say it takes two to make a fight. - You're wrong, Pete, very wrong. - They are like wild animals. Like they should be in cages. - What can we expect? While we're breaking our necks trying to make a living, the goons and the racketeers have the power and the money. They walk around here nice and clean, smelling like cologne. We don't smell so good to our kids. (car horn honking in distance) - Hi. I've been wanting to talk to you since the other night. - You gonna start another lecture? - I just wanted you to know I told your father the truth about how the rumble started. - Yeah, I'll bet he couldn't even hear you. - I ever give you a bum steer? - Everything looks like a lousy rap around here. - Even through that? - So what do I see? Ritzy places across the river on the East Side, Sutton Place. Guys like Brindo wind up over there. - Look hard enough and you'll see France, maybe, and England, Italy, Africa. All you have to do is look at those ships pulling out. There's a whole world outside of the Brooklyn waterfront. You think the only ones who get to see things and live 'em are men like Joe Brindo? - Well, maybe I'm nearsighted, then, maybe I need glasses. - You don't want to understand. How could you possibly think a cheap hood like Brindo is important? - He's got money, hasn't he? You tell me what else is important. - Know what's happening downstairs? - What's the difference? - We organized a new local at last. Longshoremen will start signing up with us first thing in the morning. This is the beginning of the end for Brindo. - (scoffs) What can a new local do when Brindo runs all the piers? - We've taken over Pier 85, the one they abandoned during the war. And this afternoon we contracted to unload our first ship. Better start looking through this again. Maybe you'll be in time to see Brindo fall off his high horse. - Hi, Mr. Kevlin. - Hello, Della. - I thought Jimmy was up here alone. - I'm just leaving, Della. - Well, bye. - Bye. - Hi! - How'd you know I was up here? - Your ma told me. - This place is getting to be like Grand Central Station. - You said I could look through the telescope sometime. - Go ahead. - There aren't many things or people you like, are there? - What are you talking about? - Or else why do you always come up here to be alone? - Listen, the only reason I got is my old man can't climb those stairs. (dramatic music) - Jimmy. - [Jimmy] Yeah? - Would you come to church with me this Sunday? (Jimmy scoffs) Well, it stops people from being so mixed up inside. They feel good afterwards. - Do you think Church is gonna change things at my place? - Always your father. Can't you think about anything else, ever? - Sure, I can. When there's a rumble, like the other night, maybe. Or maybe if there's a real cool chick at one of the dances. - Jimmy, don't. - Well, you asked me, didn't you? You get the answers and you don't like 'em. You, Kevlin, my father, you all think I'm some kinda hood, don't you? - No, you think you are. (dramatic music) Oh, Jimmy, please. Let me go. (longshoremen chattering) - [Marchesi] That a boy! Come on. - Boy, I wish 'em luck. - Why, because Marchesi's your uncle? - Ah, it'll be good for everyone to get rid of Brindo and shape up. - Wise up, will you, man? Listen, you can't fight city hall and around here Brindo is city hall. (Diggers chattering) - Tell me where the papers are or I'll let you have it with this ray gun. - Hey, that's real. - Yeah. A real ray gun. Very complicated. Works by atomic energy. - Where'd you get it? - Man, I'm telling you, this real strange cat from Mars, he came flying through my window and he said to me, "Wimp, man, this is for your protection "against your enemies." - Does Jimmy know you got it? - No, he don't know. Why don't you tell him? I haven't disintegrated anyone all day. - I won't, but I think you're crazy, Wimpy. - Yeah. I'm crazy. But I'm gonna throw a real scare into those Stompers when we rumble. (ship's horn blowing in distance) (longshoremen chattering) - Okay, quiet down, boys! My good friend Pete Smigelski's got something to tell us. (longshoremen chattering) - 10 years ago the mob broke my back because I was trying to organize a decent local. This is a big day for me. It will be just as big for every man on the waterfront who has guts enough to fight this thing through. (longshoremen applauding) - All right, boys. All right, boys. And now we're gonna here from our friend Dan Kevlin. (longshoremen chattering) - We expected more men to show up, but they're probably scared. They're waiting to see what happens. That means the whole waterfront is watching Pier 85. Now, whatever you do, avoid trouble. A fight can ruin us. You men do your work and leave the rest to Ferd Marchesi, your foreman. Okay? (longshoremen exclaiming) - They're suckers, all of 'em. My old man can't fight Brindo anymore, so he's got those guys all steamed up to do the job for him. - I don't know about your father's reasons for wanting a new local, but my uncle has enough of his own. - Let's go to work! (longshoremen exclaim) Try and round up some more men. We ain't got half enough to work that ship. - Yeah, okay. - Well, it's a start. Joe Brindo will get his now. - The boys are battling to form a new local, Pete, not personal revenge against Joe Brindo. - It's the same thing. You will see. - Still isn't a good longshoreman in the bunch. They'll need help. (ship's horn blowing nearby) Hey, Jimmy! - Yeah? - Any of you boys like to work longshore today? I can get a summertime school permit for anyone under 18. - We work longshore we work for Brindo. - Wait a minute! Hey, fellas. Dan Kevlin says he can get us summer permits to work longshore. How about it? - Nobody scabs around here. - Talk for yourself, I'm going. - Leave him alone, man. - Coming, Mr. Kevlin! You coming, Sully? - Yeah, man. - See you later. - Well, let's go with them, huh? (Diggers chattering) - You guys are coming with me. - Where we going? - To the pier. My old man's been waiting for this. I wanna see what happens. - Let's go, huh? - You stay here, Pooch. - [Poochie] "You stay here, Pooch." - I'll take some boys and put that print shop out of business quick... - No. Bad business hurting a cripple, but psychology, stir up a real revolt. - Why don't we get Marchesi then? - Look, I run things down here. You do like I say or you'll be back in the shape up carrying a hook. - What do you want us to do? - Go on down to Pier 85, take a couple of the boys with you. Talk to the men, tell them I said to lay off. - (exhales) You let me take a bunch of our boys... - If they see a mob down there you got a riot on your hands! Tell 'em Joe Brindo says nothing'll happen if they walk off right today. - I'm not so sure. - (shouting) Look, will you please do like I say? Joe Brindo's word is good enough for them stiffs. You tell 'em to get off that ship or there ain't one of 'em'll do another day's work around here, tell 'em I say so, Joe Brindo! - You heard the man. Let's go. (ship's horn whistling) - I won't have a ship left when you people get through. - These are good men! You just got strange gear. - Strange gear. You guys have all got my sympathy, Marchesi, but unless you get more and better men to speed up this operation, I'm moving to another pier. (ships horn blowing) - Well, here's a few reinforcements. - You've worked the longshore before, Rocky, have the other boys? - I can show 'em the ropes, Uncle Ferd. - Okay. Tops, get 'em started in number two hold. - Okay. Come on. - Let's go. - That nephew of mine is gonna be okay. Hey, where's Pete's kid? - Sitting there, hoping we make a bust of it. I'm worried about him. - Me, too. (ship's horn blowing nearby) (car rumbling) - Looks like we got company. (ship's horn blowing nearby) Make 'em come to you. (ship's horn blowing nearby) - Come here, you guys. All a' youse, every one a' youse. Pile around, here, I got something important to tell you. I got a word from the boss himself, Joe Brindo. He gives you two minutes to get off this scab job. Joe Brindo. And if you don't you might as well head for the weeds right now. You'll never get another job around here. And you get off this job, Marchesi. The men don't want no change in the setup here, they're happy. They work when Joe Brindo says. You understand that? - Look, you tell Joe Brindo this hiring was done according to straight union rules. - I've got a way to handle this, too. - I don't want no trouble from you, mister. (thrilling music) - Let me go! - Your uncle's gotta take care of this. (thrilling music) - That's broke both their legs. - Nah, those sacks are like featherbeds. (thrilling music) - Come on, Marchesi! - Get up there! - Drop it down! (thrilling music) Take it away! (longshoremen cheering) (dramatic music) (brakes screech) (men chattering) - Get him inside, call a doctor. - They beat him mighty badly. (men chattering) - Who beefed him, son? - There was a fight on the docks. - You're good boys. I won't forget this, Jimmy. - I hope you took good care of Frank Mangus. - Do we have to fight about it? - You asked for that, didn't you? Helping Brindo's men. - Can I ask you somethin'? When do you figure I'm gonna be able to have a few ideas of my own? - You're my son. You will do and think what I want. - Pa, I just can't keep fighting you like this. Every time we blow off at each other I get sick. But you got no right to run me like you run that printing press! - You helped Brindo's men. - Do you know why? - Yes, I know why. You're licking his boots because you think some of that easy money will rub off on you. - I helped Frank Mangus because this whole waterfront's gonna start poppin'. Marchesi and you started it. Somebody's gonna get hurt real bad, Pop. I don't want it to be you because then Ma would be the one to suffer. - I tell you, you... - Pa, you gotta listen to me. People are beginning to think you've lost your marbles. - And that's what you think? - Pa, would you listen to me for the love of Mike? Let's not fight again, just listen to me. - [Pete] Listen to you, you Judas? You helped Frank Mangus. You helped Brindo's man. - I only wanted to help you. - Get out. (dramatic music) Get out of this house. (dramatic music) - He's gone. He won't come back. - You are to blame, Anna. He's your son. A woman's son, no more guts than a weak-kneed woman. - A decent woman's son he would be, if you would let him. He was right. You can't break his back, so you are trying to break his spirit. (motor rumbling) - 3.60. Four, five and five is 10. Thanks, come back again. - Okay, Chuck, see you. - Bye. Hey, Jimmy, look out! - For what? - That's gasoline you're monkeying with. Old man Dormeyer gave you a place to live here, you wanna blow the joint up? - So we'll live dangerously. (auto part splashes) (car horn honks) - Hey, we've got company. - Hi, friend. - Hi, Mr. Brindo. - Hey, kid, how you doing? - Hi, Mr. Brindo. - Been asking around for you, I found out you left home. - Yeah. - Well, where are you living? - Up there in the loft. - Do you get paid anything around here? How much? - Mr. Dormeyer gave me a place to stay. - Look, if you needed dough, kid, why didn't you let me know? I told you I wouldn't forget what you did for Frank. Here. You take this. - I'll pay it back. - Jimmy, we're friends. You need any help I wanna know about it. You just pick up the phone and you call me, huh? You hear me? - Okay. - All right. Now, you remember, you need me, you call me, right? - [Jimmy] All right, Mr. Brindo. (motor revving) - How much he give you? Wow, a hundred bucks. - Man just like it was water. (ship's horn blowing in distance) (Poochie whistling tune) - Where's Jimmy Smiggy? - He ain't here. - Hey, I got eyes, I said where is he? - He's not living here anymore. - Wait a minute. Hey, you tell him that Tony Lightning wants to see him. Who's that belong to? - Uh, it belongs to Jimmy, I was, I was just taking it to him. - Well, look at this. Well, what do you know? You can see clean into that burlesque dive over in Flatbush. - Hey, let me take a look at it. (chuckles) Somebody's gonna get stew for dinner tonight. - Any dames? - Telescope ain't for that. - Oh, it isn't, huh? Here. - What do you say we keep it? Hey, watch out, there, champ! - Oh, ow, ow! - Hey, you guys, you think he'll bounce if we dump him over? - No! - Hey, you know, maybe if he bounces we can use him as a handball, huh? (Poochie straining muffled) - Della! Della, help! - That's sweet, yelling for his big sister. - Hold him over, come on, hold him over. - Let me get his hands. (Poochie whimpering) There. - Now hold him over. - Let's go over. (Poochie grunting) - (muffled) Help me! Help! - All right, come on, yank him up. (Poochie whimpering) - You guys are gonna have a rumble for this! You'll see, you'll get what's coming to you! - That's right, kid, we'll rumble! You tell Jimmy Smig that, you understand? Tonight! Go on, leave him alone. Come on. (ship's horn blowing nearby) (dramatic music) - [Poochie] Jimmy! - What's the matter, Pooch? - A rumble! The Stompers on the roof! A rumble! - What'd they do to ya? - They were gonna throw me off the roof. I think they might have busted your telescope. I tried to stop 'em, honest! - Hey, round up some of the guys. - Yeah. - Get going! - I'll see you later. - Listen, I don't want you with us tonight, do you hear me? I don't even want you around watching us. - But I got a right to get in this one. - Can you run the gas pumps? - Well, sure, but... - Then watch the place till we get back. (dramatic music) (tool clattering) (tense music) - Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy, Stompers! (dramatic music) (thrilling music) - Poochie! - I'll get him. - On your way, grandpa! (thrilling music) - Poochie! Pooch! - Here, I'll... - What happened to him? - He'll be all right. Give me a hand. Here we go. - Pooch! (thrilling music) - Come on, Smiggy. Come on! (tense music) - You wanted a rumble, huh, Tony? (laughs) (tense music) (gun fires) - Cops! Cops! - It ain't cops! Wimpy's got a gun! - Let me fix it, it's jammed! (dramatic music) - Get back! We gotta get rid of this gun. Take the Digger jacket off. - You heard him. (dramatic music) - Okay, commandos, beachhead secured. Next stop precinct bullpen. - We didn't do nothin'. - And I was just comin' from the movies. - Come on! - Hey, where is Chuck? This place was left all alone! Now, look here! I run a place of business here. One of you guys is supposed to stay here at all times. And one more thing, if you want to stay up in that loft, you've got to earn it and keep on your toes if you know what's good for you. You hear me? Are you listening? (dramatic music) - You're smart, you tell 'em I ain't been out. (dramatic music) - Put your jacket back on and let's go. - What for? - Well, you can't take him away, officers. Somebody's gotta be here in case a call comes in for the tow truck. - Well, we're sorry, Mr. Dormeyer. One of 'em cut loose with a gun. Come on! (dramatic music) (thrilling music) - You have to be as young as they are to catch those kids. - Well, he won't get far. Come on. (suspenseful music) (rotary phone dialing) (line buzzing) - Hello, Mr. Brindo? - Oh, it's you, Jimmy boy. It's the kid, he's in trouble. Yeah. Listen, Jimmy boy, have you got guts enough to go right down there now and give yourself up? - To the cops? I don't know. Yeah, you should know all the angles. Okay, Mr. Brindo, just like you say. Okay. (kids chattering) All right, knock off the smoking. (kids exclaiming) Knock it off! (taps desk) Okay, big shot. You only got one question to answer, who are the leaders in your bunch? - Look, I don't know nothin'. I'm deaf, dumb, and blind. - All right, let me lead you. Go on in. (kids groaning) This one's the spark plug for one bunch, Captain, but he's dummied up tight as a clam. - [Captain] Where's the other leader? - Well, we got a stakeout at his folks' place. - All right, step back, you. We're gonna catch the other leader. Then I'm jamming him and you right through juvenile courts to reform school. The rest of you punks are going on record. Fingerprints and all. - Listen, Callahan, you send two boys to Almira, they'll come back finished criminals. You put the others on a record and they'll never live that down. - What do you want me to do? Send 'em home and let 'em start another war? (kids murmuring) What's this? - Well, he's the kid we're looking for. (kids murmuring) - Where'd you get the money to hire a lawyer like that? - Me? - Since when are you taking kid cases? - Since tonight, Captain. - I suppose you have the habeas corpus writs, all legal like. - Bonds are posted, too, if you're interested. - I just lost interest. You know, somebody could've been killed tonight? - Nobody was. - Someday you're gonna find out the laws weren't made just for you. You kids report to Dan Kevlin every day. Any more trouble, you'll find it'll take more than a lawyer to keep me from booking you. Just a minute! You'll wait till I finish these reports. - Oh, say, Dan. You've been battling for these kids for a long time. Do you really think they're worth it? - Sure. Remember when missionaries went into the jungles to convert the heathens? - Are you kidding? These hyenas don't know the meaning of the word religion. - You're wrong, Fitz. Everybody's got it inside of them someplace. You ever know even the dumbest human being who hasn't asked himself, "How did I get here?" The minute he did that he was thinking about religion. Whether he knew it or not. - Sure. But still, that's a job for a priest or a minister or a rabbi, not just a guy from a Settlement House. - Yeah, it's their job. It's my job, it's your job. It's the job of mothers and fathers. It's the jobs of men who let neighborhoods like this exist. - But you saw what they did to that kid, Pooch, put him in the hospital. Now, do you really think you can make something out of kids like that? - Depends on what you expect. Me, I'd be satisfied to see 'em turn out as decent human beings fit to live on earth. - Beats me. - You know something else? The worse they are the more help they need. (chuckles) See ya, Fitz. (dramatic music) - Gee, Poochie was sure lucky. The doctor said one of his ribs could have punctured a lung. - I told him to stay out of the rumble. Wanna sit? - All right. (romantic music) When Poochie gets out of here I want him to go away. - Where to? - Mr. Kelvin said he can arrange for him to go to summer camp. - The camp the Settlement House runs? - Uh-huh. But Poochie thinks it's for Sissies. - (chuckles) He won't go, huh? - He would if you told him to. He'd do anything you said. But Poochie says sometimes you talk about things, interesting things like... Well, like all the places you wanna see. - Any place'd be better than the waterfront. - Is the telescope all right? - Yeah, it's not busted. - What do you think about when you're all alone and you look through it? - Ah, what's the difference? - Please, tell me. - Well, you look at the Brooklyn Bridge, for instance, or those ocean liners or the Empire State Building, things like that, you know? You start wondering what kinda guys ever thought up anything as big as they are. Every piece of wood, every nail, every hunk of steel, every boat, all have to be exactly in the right spot. And all those things'll still be there when the guys that built 'em are dead. - Just like... Like those men put up monuments to themselves. - (chuckles) That's one I didn't even think of. I'll tell you what. I'll tell Pooch the kids at the camp wanna see his stitches. - Thanks, Jimmy. - You wanna take the streetcar or the subway home? - Mm, streetcar. I like to look out the windows. (chuckles) - Yeah, subway's okay if you're in a hurry, you know? (tugboat whistling) - Oh, the waterfront's always so beautiful at night. - Yeah, you can't see the garbage floating in the water. (siren blaring nearby) - The police still aren't after you, are they? - It's a meat wagon. It sounds like it's on your block. Who was it? - They don't know. Hit and run. Smashed his face in pretty bad. - I thought these kids looked suspicious. They swiped the dead guy's watch and wallet. - Rolling a dead man. Well, it could only happen in this neighborhood. Marchesi? This is Ferdinand Marchesi, the dock boss. This was no accident, Fitz. - Well, what are we gonna do with these kids? This is no case for the juveniles. - Take 'em straight to the Assistant DA's office. Get him out of bed if you have to. - [Fitz] Right. Come on. - What does it mean? - Trouble. - You gonna tell your father? - I'm not going near him. - Maybe you should. - My feeling sorry for him won't do any good. He doesn't even look on me as his own kid. - Jimmy, a father and son are supposed to love each other. - Yeah, that's what it says in those books you read. - He's dead? Marchesi's dead? Oh, no. No, he can't be. No, you're lying. They couldn't do it. Marchesi was smart, he watched every move! - I'm not lying, Pete, he's dead. - Oh, he can't be. It's Brindo who's supposed to die. Brindo! - Pete... - Marchesi was my body. What my brain said to do, he did. Someone's got to get Brindo. Someone's got to smash him down! - Quiet down, Pete, yelling won't help. - I'll kill him myself! - Anna. - He sent my son away. He kicked him out of the house. - Anna. - Why did it have to happen? - It's all finished now. Joe Brindo has won. - The only thing that's happened, Pete, is maybe you'll be able to see things straight from now on. Straighter than you've seen for 10 years. - I don't know. - Maybe revenge won't catch up with Joe Brindo, but justice will. You'll see. - Petey. You want to go to bed now? You are tired, you should sleep. (mournful music) - I hope you realize the seriousness of your offense. Rolling a drunk was bad enough, but this man was dead and you're in deep. I can put you in the home of correction until you're 18. You realize that? - Yeah. - Yes, sir. - But I'll try to be fair, providing you cooperate. I will promise you nothing, but I will speak to the juvenile court when your case comes up. - Most of Brindo's mugs are in this section, Mr. Fuller. - Look these pictures over carefully. Try to pick out the man you saw driving the car. Be sure you get the right man. - This one! - Yeah, that's him. - This one. - Right there. - [Fuller] Lou Bassett. (chuckles) Nickname Peanuts. All right, boys. - Okay. - Homicide? - [Dispatcher] Yes? - Pick up Lou Bassett, nickname Peanuts. - You botched this one up pretty bad, Joe. - Yeah, well, it's Pete Smigelski's fault. If he hadn't stirred things up with that lousy rag of his, this wouldn't 'a happened. - Look, why don't you stop fooling around, Joe? Why don't you let me put that print shop out of business once and for all? - No. We've got enough headaches without attracting more publicity. If I'm gonna get Bassett off... - There better not be any ifs about that! That yellow bellied canary'll sing a tune that'll fry us all if he's got the chair staring him in the face! - Sit down, Joe. Now, I've studied this case from every angle. They're gonna ask for the chair, all right, but the only direct testimony they've got is from those two boys. Our only hope is to controvert that testimony. - What does that mean? - We need a direct witness to the murder. A witness that we can handle. - What would you have him do? - Take the stand, swear that he witnessed the murder, saw the car and deny that Bassett was in it. - What about using him? - We need somebody the jury will believe. Look, don't you know one honest looking person? Someone who lives right in the neighborhood? - Well, it ain't Park Avenue, you know. - Kids are their witnesses. We could break 'em with an older and a brighter kid. - That I can deliver. - Now, he's gotta be out of diapers, know right from wrong. - This one fills the bill extra good. Pete Smigelski's son. Can you beat that for a reliable witness? (car horn honking) - Hey, Jimmy! Oh, Jimmy! (car horns honking nearby) (door creaking) - I got an old friend of yours here. - Hi, Mr. Gotham. - How are you, Jimmy? I'm very glad to see you. Mr. Brindo's been saying some very nice things about you. - Yeah, Jimmy's my boy. - Joe, why don't you go make a drink while I talk to Jimmy? - Yeah, that's a good idea. - Sit down, boy. You're Polish, aren't you? - Yeah. - You Polish kids are all pretty bright, you know that? - You want something, Mr. Gotham? - (chuckles) What do you think of Brindo? - He knows how I feel. - Yeah, I suppose so. That's why you're here. Brindo's in a jam. Now, I'm trying to help him, Jimmy, but I can't do it alone. I want you to appear in court. - Appear in court? - Yeah, you probably read about this Bassett case. Fellow they call Peanuts. Well, the Assistant District Attorney is trying to get Brindo through Peanuts. He's trying to get Peanuts to frame Brindo by promising to save him from the hot seat. - So? - Let me show you a photograph of where the accident happened. - I know where it happened. I was there. - I see. Tell me what you saw. - Well, Marchesi was stretched out, only nobody could identify him till they caught those kids who stole his wallet. - What kids? - The kids who saw the accident. - You mean they rolled Marchesi? - Sure. (dramatic music) - Uh, Jimmy, how would you like to stay here for a few days with Mr. Brindo? - Stay here? - Yeah, we should all get to know each other a little better. - That the way Mr. Brindo wants it? - He'd prefer it. - He knows what he's doing. It's all right with me. - Come on, I'll show you your room. - Your Honor. I was not trying to conceal anything. Here is the charge that I intend filing in the juvenile court when these proceedings have ended. The fact that he stole a wallet and a watch is not an issue. The defense is deliberately trying to confuse the issues in this case. - It's unfortunate these facts were not brought out before. However, I ask the defense counsel to bear in mind that this boy is not on trial here. - Now that you've finally told the truth. - Object! Not proper cross-examination. - Sustained. - When the District Attorney questioned you following your arrest for stealing from a dead man, did he promise you leniency if you would identify the murderer? - Object! This is irrelevant and immaterial. - The witness will answer. - He said he'd put in a good word to the judge. (crowd chattering) - Your Honor, I charge coercion. Anyone that would rob a dead man certainly would identify whomever the District Attorney chose to prosecute. - Object! This is an opinion. - Sustained. The jury will disregard the defense counsel's statement. - That's all, son. (crowd chattering) - Does the prosecution have any other witnesses? - Your Honor, the prosecution rests. - Is the defense ready to present its witnesses? - Yes, Your Honor. Will you call Jimmy Smigelski to the stand, please? (crowd chattering) Name? - James Smigelski. - Age? - 17. - Occupation? - I go to high school and work longshore summers. - [Gotham] You were born on the waterfront, were you not? - [Jimmy] Mm-hmm. - Do you remember where you were when Ferdinand Marchesi was killed on the night of August twelfth? - Yes, sir. - Were you alone? - Yeah, it was about 11 o'clock and I was crossing Beamer Street when a car cuts the corner pretty sharp, going fast. I jumped back just in time. - Did you get a good look at the car? - Yes, sir. It was a 1947 black Buick four-door. - May I have that photograph, please? Is that the car? - Yes, sir, that's it. - What did you do then? - Well, after awhile I heard the wagon on the block, so I run to see what's going on. - Did you see? - Yeah. (clears throat) I saw them loading a body into the wagon. I didn't know who it was until I heard the cops talking. They said it was Marchesi, the dock boss. - Now, Jimmy, did you get a close look at the man who was driving the car that almost ran you down? - I sure did. - Could you identify him? - Yes, sir. He was a real big guy and... - Yes, uh, is he in the courtroom? Take your time. - No, I don't see him. - Will the defendant please stand? Face the witness. Is that the man? - No, that ain't him. I seen him around before. If it was him I'd know it right off the bat. - Your witness. (crowd chattering) - Your Honor, in view of the importance of this testimony and the late hour, the prosecution requests an adjournment so that we may begin a full cross-examination tomorrow morning. (bright piano music) - So then this half-baked Assistant DA gets pale around the gills and asks for an adjournment till tomorrow. (all laughing) You shoulda seen his face! I thought he was gonna have a fit when Jimmy testified. That kid was terrific. Hey, Jimmy, boy. What's with the mopin' around? I get you a new suit for the celebration, you just sit here wrinkling the pants. Grab yourself a girl. - No, I'm all right. - You're the guest of honor, Jimmy. Come on, baby, you're supposed to circulate. Sit this one out for me. - Sure, Joe. - Good looking kid like him shouldn't need glasses, yeah? - Say, that's all right. (bright piano music) You know much about dancing? - You complainin'? - (chuckles) How old are you? - 18 almost. - Oh, just right. (doorbell buzzes) - Joey. Hey, Joe. I gotta go just for a little while, baby. I'm sorry. - It's all right, what? - Joey, there's somebody at the door. - Yeah? Nobody's supposed to show up here now. - Well, what are we going to do with Jimmy over here? - Get him out of sight. We don't want anybody to see the witness here. (doorbell buzzes) - Excuse me, baby doll. I have to take your cute boy from you, okay? - Okay, monster. - Crazy. Look here, Jimmy... (bright piano music) - We want to see Jimmy. - Are you kiddin', Pete? This is the last place in the world he'd be. - Please. We are sick worrying about him. He must be here. Where else could he be after today? - You better breeze, Pete. You can't keep track of your own kid, that's your fault. - I'll talk to him, Mr. Brindo. - All right, Jimmy. - Jimmy. You want us to go crazy worrying? - He kicked me out, didn't he? - You might have been dead. - Ma, I'm fine. - Maybe it would be better if he were dead. - Oh, Pete! - If he's rotten all the way through, if he's so rotten he would lie for a killer like Brindo... - Pa, get out of here. You're calling me a liar in front of all these people. - You will have to live with that lie the rest of your life. - You heard your son tell you get out. You're lousing up our party, Pete, so maybe you just better do like Jimmy says. - From now on I have no son. - (quietly) Jimmy. - Ma. Ma, he's making a federal case out of it. I'll see you later. (crowd chattering) (bright piano music) - Come on, baby, we have a dance to finish. - Finish it yourself. - Frank, let him alone. He'll snap out of it in a few minutes. - Here's your drink, baby. Over here, come on. Like the music? - All right, what's everybody so dead about? Come on, let's live it up! (bright piano music) - [Poochie] Psst! Jimmy! - How'd you know I was here? - I followed you. I've been casing the joint for hours. - What for? - Well, I was supposed to leave for camp today, but Della got sick. - Is it bad? - Yeah. She wants to see you. Come on. You can be back before they miss you. - Okay. - [Boy] Say, man! - Hey, what are you guys, nuts or something? - All right, put him in the car. - [Jimmy] You guys are nuts! - [Rocky] Get him in the car. - You're crazy! (tires squealing) (car doors banging shut) - Come on. - You're gonna be sorry you pulled this one, Rock. You cooked this up? - Yes, Jimmy, I had to talk to you. Please sit down. - I ain't backing out on Joe Brindo. - You got no choice. - That's not true. We agreed that if Jimmy decides to go back you'll take him there before morning. You're lying to protect Joe Brindo. You're perjuring yourself. - I'm helping a friend that's being framed. - Malarkey! - Jimmy, if you don't tell the truth, I'm going to go to court and I'm going to testify that you were with me the night Marchesi was killed and that you lied. - Joey. Joey, the kid, he's gone. - What? - That's right, I just came from his room now. He's gone. The window's wide open. - Do you think he went home? - Oh. (scoffs) - Joe. If that kid blabs, it's taps for me in the law business. You're through on the waterfront. If he's even had a thought of reneging, he'll never hold up against cross-examination tomorrow. He'll blow us sky high! - All right, all right, so I have to shut his mouth. I know that. I treated him like he was my own kid. And he double-crosses me. - I gotta go through with it now! - Why? - Man, you get five years for lying on the stand! - Maybe Dan Kevlin can help. - It won't do any good. - Well, if anybody would know what to do, he would. I'll get him. - It's kinda late. We better go with her. - Who's gonna watch him? - I gotta stay anyway, I'll watch him. - If I say I'll stay that's enough. - All right, Jimmy. We'll expect you to be here when we get back. (telephone ringing) - Yeah? Who? Okay, keep talkin'. - That's right, Mr. Brindo. He's hiding up in that garage. Well, I saw him there myself. Sure. Well, just remember it was Wimpy who told ya. Sure. Sure, I'd like to work for you. Bye. Thanks, Mr. Brindo. (door rattles) - Hey, Jimmy. - Yeah? - I just got a call from Mr. Dormeyer. I gotta deliver the pickup truck. Hey, look, you promised you'd stay here, so... - Sure, sure, beat it. You guys give me the creeps. - I'll see you later. (door bangs shut) (motor revving) (crate clatters) (brakes screech) (car door bangs shut) (jazz music on radio) (radio clicks off) (truck door slams) (car doors bang shut) - Hey, Jimmy! Jimmy boy! Better find the lights. (pounding door) - All right, all right, stop pounding! I'm coming. (pounding at door) - I just saw Joe Brindo at the garage. If he finds Jimmy there he's gonna kill him! - But Brindo is Jimmy's friend. - Don't you understand? Jimmy ran out on him. What's the matter with you? You're his father, you gotta help him! - Jimmy did that? - Will you please do something? - Petey! Petey, not you! Get the police, please. - No, no, I'll go myself. (Anna crying) - He ain't up there, Joe. (door opening quietly) (can clattering quietly) (gun fires) - You can't get outta here, Jimmy boy. (gun fires) - Pa, get outta here! (gun fires) (gun fires) (siren blaring in distance) You okay? - I don't know. It hurts. - I'll get a doc. Oh, thanks, Pop. (dramatic music) (longshoremen chattering) - Hey, Jimmy, look! A letter from Poochie. - Yeah? - He says they have a pet bear at camp they feed every day. - Jimmy! Hey, Jimmy! - Yeah, Pop? - You can't make any money up there! - Maybe not, but I'm sure makin' time. - Jimmy! (Della laughs) - You know what? Pop told me he'd give me a commission on whatever business I brought into the shop. - Oh, Jimmy, that's wonderful. - Maybe by next year I'll have enough dough to go to City College. Imagine that. Me, Jimmy Smigelski, I'm gonna learn how to build things. - You'll do it, too. - Anything you see through that I'll be able to build. Take a look. - I've seen enough already. Come on, let's go downstairs. I promised your ma I'd help her with dinner. - You did? (dramatic music)
