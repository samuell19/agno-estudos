What's wrong? Diaz? Let's go home. Keyla. Come on. Fine. Morning, Sir. / Morning. Morning, Mr. Jali. Morning, Sir. / Morning. Hey, Mahir. Hey, Bro. What apparition are you talking about? It's just a shadow. You're overreacting. Let me see. Look carefully. Clearly it's an apparition. I don't see anything. What did I told you? Look for a real ghost. Don't look for fake ones. How can you find real ghost if you're being fake? That's why you should come along. Don't just play games. So when is your next hunt, Diaz? Next weekend. Are you sure? That you'll see an apparition, huh? Instead of dissing me... You guys should... ...come with me to Leuweung Hejo. Leu... What was that? Leuweung Hejo. / Where is that? Eight hours car trip from here. It has a forest for us to camp. And there are ghosts for sure. Can't we have a normal weekend? It brings bad luck to look for ghosts. A taboo. Muti, just say that you're scared. If you're scared, just stay behind. It's that simple. Who says I'm afraid? / Ouch! Stressful girl! I'm in. Me too! Key, you're coming too, right? Key. Please? Okay? Come with us, okay? Mut. / Huh? Aren't you ask me to come? Ew, why should I ask you to come? Okay, we leave at Friday afternoon. We start preparing our equipments and needs. Ask Mr. Jali to keep them save. I'll send you a WhatsApp message. Gosh. How can I afford such equipments? Mommy's boy. Well, I have a car. You need my car, don't you? The bell's ringing. / Let's get into class. Let's go. / Come on. Mahir, let's go. / Are you still drinking this? Just take it with you. / Fine. Leuweung Hejo? Diaz. Are you sure you wanna go to Leuweung Hejo? Key. This is the purpose of our adventure. This is the ultimate goal. Aren't you curious? Ma'am. Diaz. You better go home. Thank you for taking me home. Take care. Alright. Grandma. This is great, Grandma. It is. So that you won't get cold when you're camping. Thank you, Grandma. How do I look? Do I look cool? / You are cool. Go on. Take a shower, get change. Dinner's in half an hour. Okay? Alright. I'll go to my room, Grandma.

We shouldn't have come here! You're the one who wanted to come here! The rest of us should've waited outside! Tio. Last night, did you drive through the sign that says "Do not enter"? Huh? / Did you drive through it? How should I know? I didn't notice. One thing for sure, Google Maps said we have arrived. I just followed the road. And I found this area. You should've woken me up. Diaz, I tried to wake you up, but you didn't. What's so hard about waking me up? I said I tried to wake you up! Enough! Morning! Where's Adis? Adis? Key? Key? Adis is missing! Maybe she's inside the tent, Dis! She can't be inside the tent! She was with me! Go find Adis! Find her! Don't just stand there! You two, calm down. Take a deep breath. How can we be calm? Tell us what happened. / Let's go look for her. Hey, hey. Guys? What's with you all? There she is. / Dis? Dis? / What's wrong? What's wrong? What's going on here? What is this? / Are you alright? Are you hurt somewhere? Of course I'm not. What's going on here? I thought you went missing! We go back now. What? But... We're going back. Key and I met an old lady. Her face was so scary. Tio! What's wrong, Tio? I'm not sure. What happened, Tio? The engine's overheated. I have to find some water. Tio, you must not go alone. Do you know where to find some water? There's a waterfall nearby. But we passed it by. Diaz! Now what? The point is, my car won't run... ...If we don't refill the water tank. Then let's just walk to that waterfall. Huh? We have to walk? Is it far? No, it's not far. While we rest, take a bath and have a breakfast. What do you say? Take a bath? Let's go then! Come on! Can we go over it? I don't know. Can you do it, Mut? / Yes, I can. Want me to help you? / I just went under it. / Okay then. Let me take your picture! Really! I'm being nice! / Seriously? Seriously! Why don't you trust me! / It's okay if I repeat the shots, right? Don't repeat the shots! Are you cold? / Huh? No. Don't you wanna swim? Why? Don't swim for too long, you'll catch a cold. Alright. Your hand is wet! Dis, take a picture of the waterfall. Alright!
