Okay. Bye. Have you brought tea for everyone? What about them? For them... I will serve them... hot. But they look innocent. Who am I? Sir... I'm asking you, who am I, in this station? You're the Circle Inspector, Sir. And who are you? Constable. You should always remember that. Yes, Sir. They look innocent to you? Who admitted you to the police? When I reached the station from home, it was 6 AM in the morning. When I had breakfast, it was 11 AM. When I had lunch, it was 3:30 PM. And when I finished all my work and went home to have dinner with my daughter and go to sleep, you guys were caught and brought here. I am really tired now. And I'm really furious! Now tell me. What do you want? If you don't act tough, and tell me the truth, I'll buy black tea for all of you, and mind my own business. Sir... We haven't done anything, Sir. We're saying the truth. We haven't done anything. I can see fear on your face. But there's not even a trace of fear within you. Huh? What? Are you a great actor? We're actors too! Already there are a thousand issues here, like political party issues and local issues. We don't get enough time to solve them. On top of that, human trafficking? Huh? Hey! Tell me! How many more people are there in your gang? If you don't tell me the truth, I'll finish you, damn it! Sir... Started my new job at Dubai. Need all your prayers and blessings. Even he has found a job! I'll delete my Facebook account. I needn't see him showing off then! What's wrong with him to put up a photo of this on Facebook? Why are you talking to yourself, Aby? No trips today, huh? No. I was waiting to go for a trip after you come. - Me? Yes. You tell me. Where should I go today? What is it? What are you talking about? Or forget it. Shall I go to your wife's house in Kattappana? That will be a long trip! You don't have to go anywhere. Just stay here! When I asked him about a trip, he's mocking me! Get going! Asking me to go on a trip? Doesn't he have any other job? Done? You can leave then. Wherever I go, you're there, huh? What can I do if you don't have any job? Can't you go for a trip? - What? No, nothing. Just stay there. Finished distributing newspapers, right? Get going! I should be slapped for talking to him! English newspaper? We don't get time even to read the Malayalam paper. Leave alone English! Kunjumol! Oh! You're here? Are you eating biscuits early in the morning? Where is he? If no one has kidnapped him in his sleep, he should be on his bed. Worthless people are not kidnapped. Oh! Then please go ahead, worthy one! Who is it, Kunjumol? It's Wednesday, right mom? The jobless guy is here early in the morning itself! Though the day has started for him, the day hasn't started for our man here, huh? My dear aunty... Only those who have a goal and foresight in life, will wake up on time. Really? - Yeah! When did you start having all these thoughts? Get me a coffee, aunty. You are the limit, aunty! Hey! Wake up, dude! Stop it! Wake up, I say! Wake up! - What are you doing? How can I cross the seas seeing this fellow sleeping so irresponsibly? Are you going to swim across the sea? I'll make you swim now. What is it, dude? What are you doing? Are you crazy or what? - Don't be angry. If you come home and pour water on me in the morning, what else should I do? Kiss you? You will kiss me! If you listen to what I'm going to say, you'll kiss me! Whatever you say, I won't kiss you! Get up and come, man! - Stop it, dude! I'll come. You go! - Haven't you worn anything underneath? No. I've locked it in my cupboard. Keep it ironed inside your cupboard. Oops! I didn't take my phone. Aunty, is the coffee ready? This guy... My leg! 2000 Riyals... It would only come up to 40,000 Rupees here. I'm not in for this! Driving a Jeep here is better than this. Don't calculate with yesterday's currency exchange rate. Calculate with today's rate. Stop it, man. It's all the same. Let's go there on this job and look for jobs with a higher salary. What is this? Is this like drinking coffee when you don't get tea? Forget it. - This guy is the limit! Here you go. What's happening with your job abroad, Aby? What do I say, aunty? Your son can't work for a minimum salary. He's a big shot! Hey! Get me a coffee. - Go and brush your teeth, bro! Drink your coffee after that. Why should I go there and suffer if the salary is not good? If I'm getting the same salary here, why should I go for that job? Then I'll drop the plans of taking him along. I will go alone, aunty. You tried many times to go alone, right? And finally... someone swindled all the money you had, right? Exactly my point, mom! You'll end up being the slave of some Arab mostly. If you leave without considering all this. Both mom and son are the same! Nice cheeks! Put your head down. One massage, and we'll be done. Lower your head, please. Chetta, if you get this done, it would feel so good to sleep at night. Will there be any problem for my head? - No way! Come on, just leave your head free. Snapped, right? - Yes. Snapped, right? Yes! - Both snapped, right? - Yes. That's it! You get this only in this saloon. Check out the other saloon. They won't snap it! Let me get you buttoned up! There are no bruises! I did it, right? Look into the mirror. Wow! You look so smart! I look five years younger, right? - Five? Where's the rest? Now try driving your Jeep. You'll fly at 100-110 kmph! How much? - You'll fly at 100-110 kmph! Hey! How much is it for cutting and shaving? Oh! That? - Yes. - 120 Rupees. It's really cheap in our town. - Indeed. Here you go. Louis, what's happening? I'll go meet Chechi. Okay. Do you have change? - Yes. Where did you get this trip from? Glory Chechi who runs that home stay? It's her trip. It must be North Indians then. It's a one-week trip, right? Let's shake hands on it, bro! I could have, if it was a one or two-day trip. This is one week, right? What is this, man? You're being all negative from early morning! Stop it! This is the problem with you guys! You keep saying that you're not getting trips. When I arrange a trip, he can't go! It's Saajan's wedding day after tomorrow. How can I stay away on this trip then? Oh! Saajan's wedding! Is Saajan your brother-in-law or what? Exactly, Chechi! Whenever there's a function, you always hang around there. My dear Chechi, how can I stay away for a trip during my friend's wedding? It's really bad. That's why. Rametta... What is it, dear? - Can you come here, please? Rametta, will you go for a week long trip? For one week? Oh no, dear! I have daily school trips, right? Don't you know that? I have to drop kids at school in the morning and bring them back home in the evening. There are many kids. Why don't you go? Saajan's wedding is happening, right? One week will be difficult, dear. I have taken a soap. Here. Take this too. Okay boss! Who else can we give this trip to? Hey Sunimon! - Yes! There's a week-long trip. Want it? I have other trips, Louis! See! This is what! There are other capable boys in this town. If you guys are lazy to work, sell that vehicle for whatever price you get and find some other job! Hey Louis! Are you selling your Jeep? I have a buyer! Hey! Try to get your Jeep back from the guys who seized it first. Come and buy my Jeep after that! I was just saying. Only if you want it! Let's go. We're leaving, Chechi. - Okay. Get going! 'Why am I feeling shy?' God! I hope I win at least 100 Rupees. What is this? What? - Move! Let me check the results. But you didn't buy this ticket from here, did you? You know why I don't buy from you? Why? - You're not lucky! Isn't that why I buy it from another shop? I'm not lucky, is it? - Yeah. - Then... go and check where you have luck! - Stop it. Let me check! Move! - I won't show it. Leave me. You tore that away? No wonder your husband left you! Why do you care? - Why do I care? She's sitting there with some wilted snacks! Tea! - Hey! You came to have tea? If you drink tea from here, you will shit yourself to death! Come with me! I'll buy it from another place. Get lost! - You wretch! Get lost! Let's trim your hair and beard and have tea. Isn't that fine? Hey! Pass me that soap. - Give it fast. You've been frothing it for long. - Here you go! Achaya! - Yes! Didn't you say that you'll be going to the MLA office today, for the strike for the farmers' title-deeds? It has been shifted from the MLA office to outside the Collectorate. Is it? - It will go on for 5-6 days. I just have to show my face there once in a while. We haven't got the payment for renting our Jeep for the vehicle rally, yet. You should remember that. I'm with him 24X7 and he hasn't given me money even for tea yet. So forget your Jeep's rent! Hey kiddo! Sudheesh! A public worker is someone who works without expecting a reward. Understood? - Isn't that why I'm silent? Achaya! We are not public workers, right? So we need to get the money for driving our vehicles. You do one thing. Keep accounts of all of it. I'll give it altogether. I've kept accounts for everything. But when will you give it? During the next title-deed distribution. So we're never going to get it. - Get lost! Achaya, don't betray us! No, kiddo! You have my word! That's my biggest fear. You've been saying this for quite long now. Shut up. - Be careful. Come on up, dude! - Chechi, check out the water. - Okay. Give the soap. - Hey! Hey! Hey dude! What is it? - Dude, look! Ready! Go ahead, click! - Wow! So beautiful! Got it? - Yeah. Okay. Come on! Hey! Why, man? Hey! Hey! - This guy! Yeah! Why didn't he respond? Good that he left. He won't give us peace if he comes here. That's true. - But who was it with him? Is there a dearth of tourists in this town? - Yeah! Achaya, fix another drink. For me too. - It's over there. Hey! - Huh? Do you want it? - What? - You're making me fix drinks? Do you want it? - I don't want it. He doesn't want it. Give it to me. Don't you want it? - Yes. Huh? - For me. He wants one. That's enough! What is this? Hey! You've been at it for quite long! Don't you have anything to study? This will be done now, Mom. Okay. Lakshmi, do you have tea? We'll have tea later. There's no milk. Then get us two cups of black tea. Hey! How's your election campaigning going on? Election campaign? Yeah! When I called you, you lifted your hand up like a candidate and went away, right? Oh! That? I was taking Hannah Chechi around to show her some places. Hannah Chechi? Which Hannah Chechi? Mom had spoken to you about a trip, right? - Yes. That was for her. She has come from Africa. A white girl from Africa? Yeah. Chechi... Chechi... Chechi... Chechi... Isn't that African trip ours? Go, man! Here's your tea. - Chechi... Ask her. - Here's the black tea. Shucks. Come on! Chechi... - Ask her. - Tell me, Chechi. Chechi.. - What is it? That girl? The one whom we saw with Kannan? Which part of Africa is she from? Chechi... Yeah. What was it in Africa...? Jabotti... What was it, Kannan? Djibouti... Djibouti... Yeah! She has come from there. Why didn't you say this earlier? Call her and tell her. We'll reach there in the morning. Don't you want to go for the wedding then? If I go for the wedding, how would the stove at my house burn? Mom, see to it that our stove doesn't go faulty! Hey! Hey! Don't mock me! Dude! Saajan's wedding? Is Saajan my brother-in-law or what? Get lost. Right, Chechi? Yeah, right! When I asked in the morning, you were acting tough, right? Chechi, are these Africans loaded with cash? What was it in Africa? Some manager... What was it, son? - HR Manager. Yeah. That! - HR? Her company's interview had happened in Kochi. After that, she has come to see our town, before going back. That's why I asked for your Jeep. So what? Our Jeep will be there tomorrow! Yeah! It will be there! - Of course! Why are you so excited about this trip all of a sudden? My dear Chechi, I don't have a single penny in hand. That's why! Say it, idiot! Don't you wanna go? - Chechi! Please help us! Please! Chechi, please. Okay. Let me see. Don't just say that. Call right away. Come on, call her. Okay. I'll tell her. So tomorrow morning! Gloria's Home Stay! We'll go there. - Okay. Don't forget! - Here. Eat it. Should we keep this back? Get lost. - Hey! Keep all this inside. My dear boys, please get going! So tomorrow morning! Don't forget! Here you go, Chechi. Wow! - Hey! Get up and come! Chechi, she was lying down there. 'Joshy Valiyaveettil, Panchayat Member, Vilakkumal Gramapanchayat' Chechi, please move. Hold on! Pull over to that side. - Yeah. Give that to me. My back is a mess. Has everyone reached? No. Kunjachan's relatives are all at Vadakkanamala, right? They will be late. Did Bennychettan say anything about him coming? Their flight has landed. They will be here soon. Anyway, let them come. Until then, Kunjachan has to lie here, waiting. Poor Kunjachan. Even when he was alive, he was waiting for that guy. Even when he's dead, it's the same situation. Let him come when he wants to. Let's go keep this. Here. - I'll go see him. - I'll come with you. Aren't you coming? We should leave immediately after seeing him. Yes, of course. I have to open my shop after going back. We'll sort that. Is the body about to be taken to the grave? - No need to hurry. The funeral will happen only after Benny comes. I'll go see then. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, Amen! Glory to God in the highest, Amen! And on earth peace, good will toward men. Amen! Our Father in Heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. And do not bring us into temptation, but rescue us from evil. Hail, Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now and at the hour of our death. You're coming only now, despite living so close? I have to climb the hill with this ailing knee, right? That's why. Keep quiet. Hello, son? Hey... I am... - Don't mind her. I am at Kunjachan Chettan's funeral. I'll call you later. It's my son Sijoy, from Dubai. - Understood. Isn't it really hot there now? He's always in an AC room. How will he feel the heat? I hope he does well. Both your children are driving Jeeps, right? Don't you know that? Why do you have to say that here now? I thought I'll ask Sijoy to arrange a Visa. - You don't have to arrange a Visa. They will get the Visa for themselves. Keep quiet. - Talking unnecessarily... Where are your children? I didn't see them here! They both have gone for a trip. Let them keep going for trips. She didn't like it when I said the truth. 'Without being lazy' 'Without being lazy' 'Do good deeds' You know... AB de Villiers? No! Jonty Rhodes? Lance Klusener? Are they your friends? What kind of a South African is she, if she doesn't know any of them? I'm not from South Africa. I'm from East Africa. You know Malayalam? Where did you learn it from? Well... Here, India... North India, South India... We know everyone. Sachin Tendulkar, Amitabh Bachchan, Mammootty, Mohanlal... We don't differentiate between them. That's why I asked. South Africa, East Africa... There are lots of differences between them, Louis. Is it so? Anyway, it's great that you can speak in Malayalam. Stop! Stop! Stop! Reverse! Reverse! Reverse! - Should I go back? I'll pull over. Wow! Look at that! So gorgeous! Got it? - Yeah. This is nothing! There's another awesome place to click photos. Where? - I'll show you. Okay, let's go. Brother, did you take the photocopy? That one. All are there, right? How much? Here you go. Please keep an eye on my bike. Where has he gone? Brother! Brother! What is it, dear? - Can you click a photo? Just one. - Why not? Click properly, okay? - Come, stand close. Chetta, not a selfie. A photo! Of both of us. Chetta, just go wide... and cover the whole background. - I know. Hey! - Take that pineapple out of your mouth. Pick up when I call! Got it, Chetta? - Ready! I'll click one more. Okay, one more. Is that fine? Is it okay? Yeah, you are okay, dear. Don't stand so close. I have to click a wide photo, right? - Hey! You're playing the fool here? Come on! Chetta, just one photo, please. - Please get going. I was looking for you. That's when they... Come, let's go. Just a minute! Give the phone back! Where are the papers? - Bro, give the phone back! Sorry. Did you ask her about taking us to Africa? I didn't get a gap yet! You didn't get the time yet? I've come with the copy of my bio-data. What about the passport? - That too. Here. - Okay, come. First let's get acqauinted properly and present it when the time is right. Come. - You should present it. Hello! Hi! Did you click the photos? Yes. - It's a great place. Yeah! Beautiful location! It's a lovely place. - Very beautiful. This is my friend. Close! Close friend! Hi. Hannah! - Aby! Aby! Aby! - Pleasure. Let go of her hand. By the way, you just need two days to see Vilakkumala. We'll take five days and see it in detail. - What is this, man? If you talk in Malayalam like this, will she understand anything? Look, Madam... Actually... You... no need... five days... .. watch this! Only.. two... Just explain it to her. I know Malayalam. He made a fool out of himself. He don't know... you... Malayalam. She knows Malayalam. Actually, Louis.. - Yes? I'm not here for sight-seeing. Oops. - What? - I want to meet somebody. Who? A friend of mine who was with me in Djibouti is here. Sherin. Boy or girl? - Girl. It's a girl, man! We were together for five years. And she taught me Malayalam. That's so nice. - So sad. What did she say? But since past two years, there has been no contact... no phone calls, nothing. I want to see her. You can see her. - We'll show you. Do you have an address? Oh yes! I have her address! Then it's fine. We can find her. And her photo. Let me show you. One second. Let me see. - Yeah. That's the address... and that's her photo. Stop it, man! Beautiful! This is nearby. We can go fast. - Yes, close! Close! How far? - Not very far. - Here! Here only! How much time? - Around... Tell her the time. He knows this place really well. That's why he's eager to answer. I know this girl. Okay. We can go? Yeah. - We can go tomorrow. Yeah? - Yeah! Okay. - Give it. Thank you. Sure. - Go back to clicking photos. Leave her hand. - Yeah. Over there. Why are you holding her hand unnecessarily? She won't like all that. That was really unnecessary. - Oh no! I forgot to give this. Keep this inside. Don't crumble it. - Then? The view is great from there. Yes, over there. We had actually declined this trip. It was my friend's wedding. We took it up only because Lakshmi Chechi compelled us. Right, dude? - Yes. She really compelled us. - Lakshmi Chechi... - Oh! Thanks. - Please don't mention it. Is your stay there okay? Yes, it's very nice. If it's not okay, will you arrange another place for her to stay? Look straight and drive, man! Excuse me, Hannah... Can you give me that phone? Thank you. Nice. - Hey! I was just checking the address. You get nice, hot corn over here. Shall we try it? - Okay. I really want to know. Have you made a vow to stop at every single place on the way? She wouldn't have eaten all this, man. You also have one. - I don't want it. Corn! Get down carefully. You don't want it, right? Carry on. - It's so cold. Look!

Is this the correct route? Yes, this is the correct route. Go and sit in the car, girl. I need to reach there before you do! What's your problem? - Get in. You just want to drive slowly, right? I'm in a hurry to reach there. These apples and oranges will become rotten. You'll ruin this! - Yeah, right! I remember all that. I will tell him. He's here. I'll put him on. Hey! Call for you. Who is it? - Mathukutty. Talk to him. Hello? As per the address, this should be the house. Right? - Don't you know when you see it? This is the house! I'll call you later. Her parents are here. Hey! Hey! Hey! Come on! Sherin's parents, right? Yes. - Yes. Didn't I tell you? - Who are you? We are... - She used to work with your daughter in Djibouti. Hannah. Hannah-mol! Sheri keeps talking about you all the time! Where is she? She is here. Sherimol! Dude, it's Sherimol's parents. - Why are you so fidgety? Stay still. Hannah! Wow! - Sherin! Mom! Hannah! It's been so long! I missed you! How have you been? - Good! Why didn't you contact me for so long? - Oh! I couldn't! Oh! I missed you! Good! Which month? Seventh month! Congratulations! You were slightly late, man! It's alright. Get your fruits. I still can't believe this. How is everything? - Everything's going good. Let's go. - Don't go! Wait. - Oh my God! How did you find my home? They helped me. Hi. - Hi! Louis. Careful. - Hi Louis! We have been to this area. - Aha! This is my friend, Aby. Hi Aby. Some fruits for you. Oh! You've brought fruits? It's good to have fruits during this time. She doesn't really eat fruits. Ask her to make a fruit shake for you. Go give that to your daddy! What? - We were saying that uncle and aunty can have it. Of course! Why should we waste it? Give it, son. Take it. How are you feeling? - Okay then, uncle & aunty! What? - We are leaving. We have lots of other work. What are you saying? I'm seeing her after so long. You can't leave so soon. Louis.. - It's all fine. We can leave after two days! We're leaving only after experiencing aunty's culinary skills. Yeah! You should definitely experience that. Right, dear? What more should I suffer? Don't you have any sisters, Sherin? - No. She's our only daughter. Oh! That's very nice. Then you can go ahead and prepare lunch! We can leave after eating. Go in. - We'll have lunch together. Come. - Careful. What work do you have after leaving? You stay here. I'm leaving. - Bring the bag. You get lost. - Get the bag, man! Come in, boys! Well, I was asking him to bring the bag. Go, bring it. - Take it yourself. You come home. - It's because she's pregnant, right? I know you'll stick on here otherwise. It's because of me, Sherin. Hannah.. - I'm sorry. - Leave it. It's all over, right? Why are you crying? Hannah, don't cry. Please don't cry. You're making me emotional, Hannah. Look! I'm pregnant now. We'll get a baby. You'll come to see the baby, right? Yes. - Next time when you come, we'll have a baby. Aunty... Does uncle help you with cooking always? Once in a while, like this. When we have guests. Shouldn't the food be tasty, kiddo? Uncle... By the way... Is there any benefit by doing rubber farming? Not at all! There used to be a good income long back. Now no one needs it. I've stopped tapping three fourths of it. If it's not needed, why don't you sell it to wood dealers? I could have! - Then? They're trying to get it for free. Do you want a good price, Uncle? Tell me if you do. Do you have buyers? Of course! I have many buyers! Is it? - Yes. - Peel those garlics quickly. Uncle... Making small talk, is it? Gawking around randomly and washing hands and getting seated, when it's time to have food like you, is not our job! I know why you came here. I also know why you came here. Whom are you looking for, son? Well, I didn't see Hannah and Sherin. I was looking for them. They are talking over there. Eat it! Hannah is not pregnant yet! What is this, Hannah? Haven't you stopped crying yet? I don't know what to say, Louis. She has been after me saying so many things, ever since she reached. She will be sad. You left from there without saying anything, right? Now you've seen her, right? Be happy! That's not how it is, Louis. Sherin had to leave Djibouti because of me. Why? This situation is because of me. Oh no! What happened to your leg? Those are all bygones, man! You guys come. Let's go have food. Come. Mom, please serve lunch! Hannah... Don't cry! They will see! Don't cry! Why are you crying? Uncle and aunty will see! Sherin is so happy to see you, right? Don't cry! Leave it. Forget it! That's enough! Mix some water! Your insides will burn! It's really cold, right Uncle? Good stuff! - How many do you have daily? Nothing like that, Uncle. I just have local stuff, once in a while. If the company is good, I'll have two or three drinks. If the company is bad, I'll stop after one peg. Well, you guys have very tender livers. When you drink, you should drink carefully. I don't drink that often, Uncle. Louis... Why are you sitting here alone? Are you bored? - No! When are you going back? After two days. You won't be coming back here after that, right? Well... Since you've met Sherin, you don't have to come here again, right? That's why I asked. Hey Louis! Shall I fix a drink for you? No. - Hey! Have a drink, man! - No, dude! Our ancestors have taught us that we shouldn't force people who don't need it. Do you know that? - Of course. Why don't you go with them? You don't drink? I... I do drink. But I'm not in the mood today. That's why. Keep it there, Uncle. We'll take it. Yes, yes! He will take everything! Hey! - What? He will be here when it's time for the delivery. - That's nice. Come, dude. - Where? If he comes back, he might settle down here. Come and take it. What is this? - Keep it there, Uncle! I'll take it. - I'm fed up of this guy. Take it. - I have to do everything! But I'll wait for you... to rejoin. - Hey! That's not for us. Didn't you ask me to take everything? - This too. Some jack fruit chips for you. Thank you. - You can have it on the way. I'm glad we met again. Uncle, call us if you need anything. - I will. Call either me or him. We'll come. Shall I leave? Uncle, next week? - Yes, of course. Okay then. Go sit at the back. I'm sure it's a baby girl. Take care. - Stay happy. Bye. - Bye. Thank you. - Get in, man! Let's go. Bye. - Bye!! Okay. Okay then! Uncle! - Yes! Bye! - Bye! What is this, dude? You've been smoking for a long time now! It's nothing. Nothing? Look at me! Don't think that I am an idiot! I can understand what's happening. We impressed her and took this trip up, to get a job! Don't ruin it with your damn romance! Yeah! After all, everyone is concerned only about themselves! No one will notice the other person's grief. Yes! This is more important for me! Dude, look at me! Do you know something? The currency there is the Dollar! Dollar! Do you know that? She said she will meet me in the evening. It's not enough to say that you'll meet her. You should go and meet her! This guy is the limit! As if there are no other women in this country! Why are you trying to do things which you can't? Damn it.. Get in! Smoking like there's no tomorrow? This sunset is very special to me. Why? There are 2-3 reasons. Well, if you could stay for a few more days, I could have shown you some more special places like this, myself. Now it's beautiful. Some special memories. And that's enough. Now it's not just that, right? Now you have Sherin... and like relatives and friends, you have my mother, Kunjumol, Chechi... and... And? Aby and me are also there, right? Why are you so hesitant to say that you are there for me? Oh no! We strike a friendship with each person who comes here. That's what I meant. What benefit do you have with my friendship? No, there's no benefit. Many new people come here, we get acquainted, and show them around such places. Then once in a while, we can remember seeing this sunset here. What else is there, apart from that? Don't you have plans to go abroad, Louis? What? I mean... to go abroad for a job? If we go abroad, we might be able to get a better salary. But it will never be like living like a king in our own town. Moreover, everyone who knows me and loves me, are over here. Oh! There are reasons like that, huh? I was planning to take you both to Djibouti. But even if you're not interested, Aby would be, right? Oh no! I didn't mean it like that! I mean... taking this extra effort to try and go abroad... I said I was not interested in that. Going abroad is a good thing. Of course! I am really interested. But all the people you like are here, right? So what? If we spend two days there, we'll have acquaintances, and then become like relatives, right? That's not a problem! It's easy for you! Of course! Are the sunsets in Djibouti equally beautiful? Must be, right? If I have to do all the work myself, why have I hired you? If you can't finish doing it within three days, you can quit and go back to Kerala. That's better for me and you! This is what happens if you appoint guys who were gambling at temple grounds, in your office. 'Idiot Subhash' Here comes the next nuisance. Yes, Subhash! Tell me. No, I'm on my way to the office. Didn't I tell you, Subhash? We will take three more months. Please wait until then. No. It's not like I'm not trying. I had spoken about you and Bineesh and sorted everything. But the HR manager had a small confusion in between. No problem otherwise. Wait for two months. Who asked you to resign from your job, as soon as I said I will try? Fall at that boss' feet and try to get back there somehow. Wait till this is sorted. Okay. I'll call you later. Now all that's lacking here is his arrival! So are you guys happy? Whatever said and done, it's such a relief to get a job! You're relieved. I'm not relieved yet. Why? Dude, I'm the driver and you're the site supervisor. This is not happening! Didn't she say that it's for one month? There's no vacancy here now. She said she'll change your job later, right? Then what? What's wrong with a driver's job? Weren't we doing that back home? What's wrong then? I'm not saying that a driver's job is bad. Then? - I'm just sad that I had to drive back home, and go through the same ordeal again even when I'm here! Dude, this is just a temporary job. You don't have to learn a new job, right? We were already working as drivers. It's a good thing. Just be okay. I'll try. - Okay. Hello! Hey! Good morning! - ' Morning! You've joined, huh? Congrats. - Thank you. Which part of Kerala are you from? We're from Vilakkumala. Vilakkumala. I know the place. My sister got married and went to Kattappana. It's right next to us. Where's your hometown, Chetta? Konni. Konni? We used to go there regularly on trips. Chetta, are there places here where we can explore and hang out? Have you come here to explore the place? - I was just... Well, to explore this place... after work... We can do all that. Chetta... One more thing... Well, you're the Calculus here, right? Calculus? - I mean... The guy who deals with money.. - Yes, accountant. Will we be paid in Dollars or...? Let me see your work first. Then I'll decide whether you'll be paid in Dollars or Francs or if you should be fired. Come. I was just saying. I wanted to know how it is here. Hello sir. Hi Thomas! Good morning. - Morning, Hannah! These are my friends. Oh! I had seen the list. Aby, right? No. I am Louis. He is Aby. - Hello. Where did you say you were from? But I didn't say it. Well... now you can say it, right? See you, Jayan. - Sir. Bye. - Bye. Your Sir seems to have a lot of attitude. You just landed here, and you've already started finding faults with our bosses? Hey! He is a good man! If you're good to him, it will be useful for you. Why did you say all that? The stay is good, Mom! No problem! Food? That's all fine. Just like our hometown. Hey! Is it your mom? It's him. What disease will he have? He is happy here! And yeah, I've called Sudhish and told him. When he comes, give him the Jeep's documents and key. Shall I hang up? Convey my regards to her. I'll call later. Hey! Look at me! Why don't you think twice before you give your Jeep to that idiot Sudhish to drive? What's wrong with him? There's nothing wrong with him. But if Joshy Chettan gives him some political work, he'll forget the Jeep and tag along with Joshy Chettan. He's not like how he used to be. He's much more sensible now. I heard that he's independent now. Good for him if he's independent. You never get tired of talking ill about others. What? Nothing! Are you coming? Don't we have to go? - Of course! I'm ready! Hey! Hey! How is it? - It's okay. Is it good? Look. These clothes suit you. It's not that, dude. I was thinking.. - What? There are all kinds of people here, right? There are Americans, French people, and all sorts of people. People who play football here like this, must be the ones who come to play tournaments in Kerala, right? Tournaments? These guys can play and reach even till the World Cup! I think they get a lot of support here. And moreover, these guys have great stamina. Look! Morever, all the runners and sprinters are these guys. That's true. - We can't do all this. Hey Louis! Didn't I ask you wait in front of that house? We just came here to see the game. Come fast. - Come! We were waiting for you. Having fun during the weekend, huh? - Yeah. When the work gets tough, both of you won't even have time to pee! That's all right. - Get in.

Okay. I gotta go. Bye. Ah! Whatever! Count the sacks on that side. Huh? Ten! Count the ones at the back. Come on! Eighteen. Nine. How many? - Eight, sir. Eight. What's happening? What Louis said is correct. 50 sacks of cement are missing. It has happened earlier too, Sir. They usually say that the sacks tore open while unloading the cement sacks at the godown. But only when I sent him behind their vehicle this time, I realized that it was not sacks tearing open, but that the sacks were being transferred to another vehicle. Yes, sir. On the way, a local vehicle comes to smuggle the goods from them. So I didn't send the vehicle to the godown, and called it back here. Jayan! - Yes, sir. Settle their accounts and fire these two immediately! Okay sir. Come. I'm really hungry. What about you? I'm not really hungry. But I can have Parotta anytime! If you're not hungry, don't eat. I'll eat it. Are you hungry? What is this, man? The same chicken curry everyday! - What can I do, bro? Didn't you go on leave? What to do, bro? They cancelled my leave saying that there's lots of work here. Those who work hard are never given enough credit. We need to be influential at the top. We're sitting here because we're influential at the top. Serve the Parotta, man. - Give it. Aby! Hey! Louis! Louis! Aby! Hey! Stop it! What is this? - It wasn't us, Achaya! They started it. - This swine came and attacked us! Get out, you f♪♪♪♪! Are you hurt? Got burnt a little when he threw the hot tea. That's all. If you had been late by a minute, you could have taken us in our coffins. They were fighting like they had decided to kill us! Come. Come on. - Get going, everyone. Come. I had found so many job offers for him in Dubai, Saudi and Qatar. But that wasn't enough for him! Salary is less, too much work, and then what? Oh! No accommodation facilities! Are you happy now that you were beaten up by the people of Djibouti? Nothing happened, right? Then what? Nothing happened to you. It all happened to me! Crazy guys like this will be there everywhere, right? Yeah, like this! Really? It's not safe to let them stay in that quarters anymore. I think we should look for another place for them to stay. To arrange another space... do you have any idea about the rent, Hannah? That much can't be allotted from the company for them. Not at company expense. At my expense. At your own expense, Hannah? - Yes. Is he so dear to you? I did have a doubt. Well, the reason for the doubt? I'm a Malayali, right? Hey! Noble sir has gone on leave, right? Why don't we let them stay there? That's right, Jayan! Noble will take at least 15 days to come back. Let them stay there till then. Just call Noble. Okay, I'll call him. I'll call him. Where are you going? Get inside. Where to? You were going on calling in the morning to meet me, right? And now you're leaving so soon? Let me finish this. - Will you please get inside? What happened? What happened? You've grown more handsome now. What is this over here? - Stop it! Thomas, where are we going? We've been travelling for long! Hey kiddo! Tell me if you have to say anything. This road ends in 5 kilometers. It's Somalia after that. Do you want to go to Somalia? - No. Well, I was waiting for you guys to finish talking. Hey kiddo! Don't be so humble! Just on weekends. Tell us what it is. If it's for a leave or loan, don't ask me! I'm fed up of everything that's happening already. That's not it. Tell him what it is. Just... Achaya... Well... Hannah... What happened to Hannah? Hannah... Hannah is pregnant. Achaya... Say something, Achaya. Is it okay if I say anything? Congratulations! Then what? - Achaya! I knew it when I saw you coming out of the room with her, in your boxers. That this would happen. When did that happen? - Many such things are happening here. And we're all idiots! Hey! - Why are you giving me scary looks? Don't try to justify yourself after getting a girl pregnant! You're talking as if I have committed a murder! I'm going to marry her. Then what's the problem? What? How? You're going to marry her? Not your wedding. Your funeral should be done now! Get a coffin for him.. - Stop it! I should be blamed for giving you both all this freedom. We are blaming you indeed! Achaya, it just happened. I didn't do it deliberately. This is the final word every decent fellow says when he gets locked. 'It just happened'. Hey kiddo! Did you do all this, after knowing about it? We're both adults, right? There's a law that we can get married and live together, right? Then what's the problem? You're talking about law? This is not India. This is Djibouti. If an unmarried girl becomes pregnant here, you'll go to jail. You can go to jail alone. I'm not coming with you! Achaya, can you buy me a ticket? I'll go back to Kerala. No one will have to go to jail. It will be over before that. How? She has a brother. Razak. Have you heard about him? - Yes. I've heard of him. You've just heard of him, right? We have seen him. He's a big time fraudster. He hates every single Indian out here. And yeah... Hannah had a Malayali friend. Sherin. - Yes. We know her. Dude, from that house we went to. We have seen her. That girl doesn't have one leg. Do you know that? Yes, I know. Do you know how she lost that leg? In an accident, right? Accident? There are many here who don't do any work and loiter around splurging their parents' money on drinks and drugs. This Razak is one among them. Razak behaved inappropriately to this Sherin. Hannah questioned him about it and created an issue. You jerk! What did you do to her? You know she's my friend, right? Why did you do that to her? What the f♪♪k, you jerk! Talk to me with respect, Razak! Don't talk to me like that. Don't show me your finger, okay? Keep your finger down! You jerk! You can't be my brother! Why? Hey Hannah, you okay? Razak, move! You... Hannah, you okay? Be careful, Sherin! Leave her alone! Move! Razak, leave her! They don't need any specific reason, right? He vented out that anger on that girl. Show me once. I know. Once she checks, she'll let me know! Alright. Send me the copy. - Alright. No problem. I'll send the mail on your behalf. Okay then. I'll see you tomorrow. Bye. - Enjoy! Bye. - Take care. See you. Where is this Razak now? Hello? Huh? Jayan! Well, whenever a family finds out about a romance or a pregnancy, a fight is common. Be it in India, or in Djibouti. So you don't have to worry. Right, Achaya? So? Why did she have to tell her family as soon as she came to know? What do you even know? Her mom had realized it already. It was she who told Razak. Achaya... We can't send her home now anyway. If we send her, I might not get her and my child back alive. You don't have to worry about that. I'll take care of her. Let her stay here. Hey Louis... Everything happened so quickly in your life. You met her, liked her, and before you know it, she's pregnant. And now... you've started staying together. Hey! Go fast! Go straight! Turn! Step on it! Oh no! Go that way. - He's right behind us! Turn that side! Oh no! Go back! Oh no! Get down! Get down and come, man! Run! Come on! Come on, run faster! This way! Achayan is here. Achaya... Achaya... Louis... Are you okay? What happened, Louis? I am fine. - What happened? When we came here, this place was like this. Jayan, what will we tell Noble now? Are you worried about that, Achayan? That's also a worry for me! He will kill us before Noble sir comes back. Look at this! He even burnt our passports. Achaya... Is there any way to get duplicate passports? For that, we have to move through the Embassy. It will take a few days. Things won't happen quickly. Can you arrange a safe place for us to move until then? Actually... it's not safe to stay here with them. That's why. To move to another place... shouldn't we consider her health as well? It's a clinic run by a Frenchman. He was a Doctor at the basecamp here. I know him from the Casino. He started a clinic when he retired from the military, and began living there. I've spoken to him about the accommodation. So he said he'll arrange a room, right next to his clinic. Where is this place? Tadjoura. - Tadjoura?

Is the bread a little hard? No. It's alright. Well, don't you call anyone back home? I call them daily, Chechi. Whenever I call, mom and Kunjomol.. keep crying. Asking me to go there. They also would want to see her, right? Right, dear? What's your plan after going back home? Well... - No plans! We just need that Jeep to make a living there, Achaya. That will be enough for you! But he has a wife and daughter now. No, Achaya. I'm not going anywhere after getting back home. I'll settle down there. She also wants that. Right? Yes, Thomachaya. You will feel like that now. This child will be growing up. Do you have any savings? Nothing, right? The child! Hannah, come! Come on! Louis! Come! Come! - Louis! Run! Louis! - Don't stop! Keep running! Get in! Move! Get in! Fast! Fast! He has left. He's gone. Louis... Baby? Where is our baby? No. Where is our baby, Louis? Nothing will happen to her. Achayan is there. He'll kill my daughter. - He hasn't seen our daughter. Louis! Let's go. Let's go back to our baby. Don't cry. We'll go back. Louis, I want my baby! I want my baby! Louis... Go! Louis! Come. Uncle will carry you now. Hey! You've been sitting here for a long time, right? Come, let's go. Like you said that day, everything happened very quickly in my life. Meeting her... making her mine.. Having a child... and I lost her too, quickly! Your issue is that you're staying in this country. This country has only given you losses. I got her from here, right? What did Achayan say about her passport? You know about the issues here, right? Thomachayan is trying his best. But... I don't think we'll get it. Then ask him to stop trying. Shall we go and meet that agent? That Ali, whom you told me about. Are you sure? We don't have any other way. Who's this? Louis! What are you thinking about? No.. It's nothing, Achaya. She's giving you too much trouble, right? Yeah, right! Too much trouble! Is it, dear? She is our only timepass now. Let's play! He never used to come home at night even if office hours are over. Now he reaches home immediately after office hours. Right, dear? It's not that, Chechi. She doesn't have a passport yet. Then, the police and the issues here. On top of that, Razak too. I don't feel so good thinking about all this. That's why. There wasn't any trouble so far, right? There won't be any problem hereafter too. Don't think about all that. We will take care of her! - Right? Why are you laughing? Whom are you smiling at? Who's that, huh? Where is he? Aby? He has gone to stock up some supplies. Is anyone going back to Kerala? Yes. Achaya... Achaya, you didn't say anything. With such a small baby, you want to board a ship, without a passport? What else should I do, Achaya? Should I leave the baby here and go? You also tried a lot to get us passports, right? It didn't happen, right? You're talking as if you didn't get passports because Achayan wasn't capable? I didn't mean it like that, Chechi. The child doesn't have a birth certificate. Her mother is not alive. And you weren't legally married, either! Then how can you get a passport? That's what I said, Achaya. If we go via sea, we won't have those problems. Why? Don't they need passports? It's not that, Chechi. Ali has found a way to get us on the ship in the middle of the sea. So this is all your plan? No.. err... Chechi, there aren't any problems like you fear. If we go to Obock, sell our vehicle and give them some money, they've promised to take us to India. They do this regularly. Don't end up falling in some trap, listening to random people. That's all I have to say. Then you tell me a way out. I want to go back to India with my child. I'll do whatever you say. It's your child, right? Do as you wish! Keep the baby's bag inside. - I did. All set? Yes, Achaya. What about your passports? - I have it with me. Then don't waste time. Get going. Keep some more money. - Achaya, we don't need this. You've been.. - Keep this. You'll have a lot more expenses on the way. Go! Give the baby to him. Come on. Okay then. Okay Achaya. Be careful. Okay. Shall I leave, Chechi? Shall I leave, Achaya? - Okay. Chechi... Get going. Achaya.. - Okay. There won't be any problem. Stay strong. Chechi... Let's go. We are young, right? We still have time. Hey! Look! Will we be in trouble? Shall we go back? Come on, man! They have seen the car. Start the car. Go! Go! Stop! Stop! Peace be unto you. And unto you be peace. Nationality proof? Who is this? - Passenger chef. Passport? Dude, the passport. Here. You also Indian? Yes. - Where are you going? Adelou. Okay. Have a nice journey. Thank you. - Thank you. Let's go. Didn't you say that there are no check-posts on the way? And we came in right into their mouths! Ali had told me about this check-post. But he said that there's no serious checking here, and that we can get away easily. Look over there. I think this rascal wants to see the end of us. - Start the car. Turn the car! Turn it around! Go! Go! It's okay. Don't cry. Don't cry, dear. Uncle will be back now. It's alright. Don't cry. Call him. - Look. He will come now. Don't cry. - Hey! The police is calling you. Sir, I.. forgot... hotel room... baby passport... Sir, little hurry... baby crying... I call the chef. Oh. Okay. I'll wait here. You get going... and wait somewhere within this station limit. We can't do anything until it is night. Tell me, dude. How long should I wait here, dude? We can do something, once it gets dark. Isn't there any other way? Stay away from this station limit for the time being. And don't fall in front of Razak again. He can identify our car. Okay then. On the way... Tell me. - Dude, he... He is after me. He won't do anything to you. He wants me and my child. You do one thing. Reach outside the station in ten minutes. Okay. Hey! Be careful. Sir... - What? Toilet... Baby change.. - Inside! Inside! Inside? - Yeah. Thank you. Come on. We will leave now, okay? Give it to me. What place is this? Ask someone here. But I don't see anyone here. There will be someone there. Hello! Obock! Obock! Obock? Yes. - This side. There? - Yes. There! Hey! Slow down. It's a shop. Stop! Let's buy some biscuits and water. But we have that in the car. Let me smoke a cigarette, man! Why don't you say that then? Bonjour. Cigarette. Packet? - Yes. Sleep, dear. Hey Aby! Aby! I have a baby with me! No! Aby! Oh no! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! What's happening? I came to pee. - Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Please! Give my baby back! Sorry! Sir, please! Please, please! Get going, dude! Sorry! Sorry. - Come on. What are you waiting for? Sorry. Go! Go! Just go! What are we doing here? Hey! Step out. Step out! Where are you going? - I'll be right back. Wait here with the baby. I'll be right back. Wait here. - Where are you going? Hey! Tell me where you're going. - I'll be right back. Hey! Come, dear. Give the baby to me. - Where the hell were you? Give the baby to me. - What happened? Where's the car? What happened? He won't come again. Who? Razak won't come searching for us again.

Can you please exempt him and the child from this? Yeah, right. We went through all this struggle together. Now, even if we have to go jail, we'll go together. Sir... Can you exempt this child alone? Darling! Dad is on the way! I am also an ordinary man. Once I go home and remove my uniform, I'm also a father to a six year old child. You never came here. Neither did we see you. Sir... Shall I drop them off? Shall I also leave, sir? Where are you guys going? We are also humans, sir. Yeah, right! But there's a small problem. Let them go. I'll tell you later. Thank you, sir. Sir.. thank...
