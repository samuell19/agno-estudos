So, what brings you here? Nothing special. - I dont bring the sun. - I bring my mother. She is angry with her doctor. He wanted to operate her. - You heal well sinusitis and elder people. - And warts. And you are sweet with kids. - My grandmother died. The funeral is tomorrow. - My neighbour talked about you, so I am coming to see you. I have nothing to lose to try. Right ? We pay our taxes for that. But I warn you : Me, I am a special case. - What can I do for you ? My kid doesnt wanna sleep. He shouts when I turn off the TV, wakes up during the night. He comes and sleep beside me, my husband goes and sleeps in my son's bed. - It is for my visit of the second month. It is facultative, but because I will get my money back... - Why do you come tonight ? - I don't know what to do anymore. - I cannot bear it anymore. - I didn't come back to the barracks. I said I am sick. I need a document. - I'm fed up with it to work round the clock for nothing ! - My family is ripped, because of the death duties of my grandmother. - Because I don't have ether anymore. - I am 30, with aches everywhere. - I am 60 and I want to keep on living - I am more than 70 and my son is worried about me - I don't have the choice. Otherwise, the less doctor I see, the better I am. *Classical music I go them. Have a good day. Goodbye, doctor. You are disorganised at home and not in your office. I let the music playing for you. It is not normal that you are late. The doctor is still late. I know how to read your mood. Today, not so good. MrsLeblanc. Oh, my God! Phone. *Allo, Is that you Edmond? You dialled the wrong number. She rang off. It is not the first time. Come in, come in. Sit down, please. What can I do for you? I don't know how to begin. When you write, do you stoop? When did it begin? - You are still untidy. At least, your shirts are ironned. Was it the first time? - Your white coat. it is better than before. Every day ? During or after meals? The patient coughs. Do you sometimes... feel nothing? - You put on weight. What about the night ? And today, for exemple ? - The white coat, I don't like it, it looks medical. Did you take a painkiller? I am listenning. - How old are you? 35 ? 36 ? - Yes ? - My stomach hurts. - I lose my hair. - I don't see anymore. - I feel dizzy. Is it because of blood pressure? - My back hurts. - I am always thirsty. I feel embarrased, but... my pain is in a private area. Is there something wrong? You are the doctor... Well. Let's check it. Please undress and lay down. How was it? Not good, otherwise I wouldn't be here. - Well. It is my wife who is not allright. - It is not perfect yet, but I feel better. - No pain anymore, but it is scratching. - I guess it is ok. - I usually took one pill in the morning and one in the evening. 3 days later, only in the morning. The box was still not empty, and it took time before I came back. Are you angry about me? My back is hurting since 10 days. 13/8, that's good. I thought the pain would disappear, but it continues. It starts behind my shoulder and it stops under my breast. I feel pain when I breathe. Because of working in front of a screen... Say "33" 33. Louder 33. The position is not comfortable. Lay down Do I hurt you ? A bit, but it's ok. They come from your patients ? Yes. Fold your knees. Sit down. Open your mouth and show me your tongue. One more time. "Aaah." Very good. When is the last time you went to the dentist? Ah... Pushing my fridge to clean the floor, My pain went from the bottom to the heel I couldn't move. My husband was present. Is it your normal weight? - Yes. You can dress now. I am not cosy, but it has been months, that physiotherapists sessions are useless for me. I am wondering if I made the good choice. I only staid under the hot lamp,, he went somewhere else and talked there, went back 15 minutes later, 3 handlings, and that's all! As if he had 2 clients at the same time. Anyway, I still feel the pain, something has to be done. How much do I have to pay? Something else? - My wife has the checkbook. - If you don't have cash, you can pay next time. - How can I thank you? I can bring you some nuts from my garden. Thanks, doctor. The door opens. Bye, doctor. Come on, we'll go to the doctor. Caroline, are you allright? I think she has nasopharyngitis. Play's medical office. I'm listenning. Please hold. - A doctor is always disturbed. Bruno, do I bother you? Yes, I know. "Never." Can I add a woman to your schedule, tomorrow? you already have... 2 interventions, and 3... no, 4 consultations. At 12 h 30. Perfect. Thanks, Bruno. See you tomorrow. It will be allright. Bruno... Dr Sachs is very kind. "Very kind" ? That's wonderful. Thank you. See you tomorrow. Mrs Renard, Put your clothes back on. Thanks, doctor. My God, your little bed is so low. How nice he is! Ah, my God. Is it possible to suffer that much? Don't change my medicines, it was already hard to get used to them. Which one was the most efficient? Nothing heals me, except the big green capsule. If I can swallow them Do you still have some? Yes. Since I didn't suffer anymore, I stopped. And because the pain came back, here I am. When a doctor is just at the end of the street... And you are so kind. In a first time, we economized. Before you moved here, I went to Lavigney. My neighbour brought me there. So complicated. But we paid him for the gas. I write you some medicines for your blood pressure. And pills to help you to sleep. Mr Renard, are you ok? He is difficult to heal. If I adivse him something to eat, he shouts at me violently. But with you... Goodbye, doctor. So ? I have to heal myself It is a serious disease and I have to deal with lots of papers What about me? It is late. I don't have a cure anymore He says that without one, it cannot be worse. Ah ok. I will have my breakfast. Please come in. I am a bit late. Come in, it's ok. Ah, I was about to close the shop. It's ok ok, thanks. - What do you want? Some lamb ribs. How many? Three Ok, that's it. - How are the babies? Fine, but they need to have another vaccine. The phone rings. Yes, doctor, it's me. no, no other vaccine. See you later, doctor. The doctor can see you. He is busy with patients. I finally made my choice. I'll come back. Not tonight. He is busy. Here it is, the schedule of the doctor. Thanks. Can I take it? Of course. That's my luck. Hello. - Hello, doctor. I would like to order a record that I heard in the radio. Rebel, "Les El?ments" Modern? No, baroque. You should move the porn videos up. What have I done? I ordered them late, couldn't see anything. I just need to see a "break" don't bother. You use a lot of, pens and sheets. Every doctors write a lot. The door of a car slams. He knocks. - Come in! Hello, doctor. Hello, mrs Destouches. Georges. Say hello to the doctor, Georges. Hello, doctor. You worked well. But I cannot finish it When it is done, it will be sad. How are your legs? Like before Georges, go and pick some dressings in the box, which is in the cabinet... to see exactly how many remains. I made you come for him. He drinks too much alcohol. When his penis hurts, he drinks even more. I give him my pills if he feels bad, but with alcohol... He is sleeping with wearing his clothes since a week. His ulcer on his right is ok, but the left one is openning. I have been quiet for a while 6 months? Kind of. What about you, how are you Fine. You feel pain on your arm It should be related to your age. I am going to check it. - When you heal me, you explain me well. About Georges, you don't say anything. You told me you couldn't answer, even to his mother. So I don't ask anymore. I feel like we know each other since a while. I could even say that your hair is too long. Like my son. I wanted to tell you... You know, this morning, in the car, you said hi to me. It is the first time, a doctor says hi to me publicly. It's not a bid deal, but it means a lot for me. Seeing how you healed my wife, I didn't expect it anymore. But with science's researches, progress... I thought we would find something. We know how the disease evolves, but not how to stop it. Phone. Excuse-me. Yes? Yes, mrs Leblanc. I see you tomorrow. At around 15 h. Thanks. Is it an emergency? No. She is sleeping. Your painkillers are efficient. She can rest. And more important, I would like to say... that the first day we went and saw you, we went out from Dr Jardin. My wife couldn't hold it anymore. She was crying as I've never seen her crying. She told him : "Doctor, do something." And he answered: "Mrs Deshouli?res, I cannot do anything for you." And then my wife told me : "Pay the doctor. Let's go." Then she said : "Come on and see the new doctor." I said : "We don't have any appointment. We don't know him." And she answered : "We won't be waiting more than we did with the other one." We waited for 1 hour : Dr Jardin gives 3 appointments at the same time. 246 00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:22,130 This means a lot. And about the rest, it cannot be worse. My wife told you everything. We clearly saw that you were chocked by what Dr Jardin said. You told me... I remind it well. "Whatever the disease is, there is always something to do." After it, she felt better. She went to her car without help. During 15 days, she was like before her disease. She was brave again. She even cooked several times. I believe she would feel better, you know. She did too. I know she will die. She knows it too. We aren't angry. It is unbearable to see her suffering. I wanted to tell you that those 15 days, they are not a lot, when the pain lasts for 3 years long, but those 15 days, she has always been grateful to you about them. And so was I. He bursts into tears. A?e ! Fuck ! Hurts. Oh, this face! what wrong did I eat yesterday? Ros? wine? It's hot! Fuck! React, you jerk! It is early ageing. Before, you had a hard-on at the awakening. What is wrong with you? I will have a spot. I hope the coffee won't make me puke. Hello, doctor Mrs Borg?s. Coffee? Have you seen my keys? Ok for the coffee. They must be close to the TV. The phone rings. Fuck! Yes? Hello, mrs Leblanc. Excuse-me, my awakening was so bad. Mrs Renard ? Can you wait for me to have my breakfast? Yes, yes, it will be ok. Thanks. See you soon. Patient is a good quality. We appreciate you because you are patient. They never saw me angry. You? Against who? For instance, against doctors. Which is normal. They talk, pontificate, take everything seriously... They piss me off. Thundering radio program. I will wash the dishes tonight. Yes, yes. You are kind, but it's like for your books. Nobody should touch them, but the books, get dusty, and at night, it's not healthy. Hello. Thanks. Have a nice day. Mr Lemaire Hello. You have 3 patients. Mrs Reverzy, before 11 h : she has to leave for her job. Are you ok, doctor ? Dr Boule? Hello, J?r?me. Bruno on the phone. Good. Can you see my urgent patients? I have to go earlier at the hospital. Allright. I am available this morning. You, you are working? What a shitty job! I spoke about you with Genevois, the pharmacist. He likes you a lot. I sum up. Sachs : stubborn, *a bit jerk, very ethical, very appreciated. He is mad at you because you give friendly prescriptions, give samples to your ill patients. Not strong enough. Not doctor enough. You are like "grandma tips". Are you still here? Yes. *No. Your patients love you. When you supplant me, they find you attentive. You go and see them again without being paid, like a friendly visit. Doctors get mad about it. Ok for your urgent patients, but without any report. Your reports, in the beginning. Do you still write that much? Well, thanks. Bye, J?r?me. You are still the same. We cannot talk with you. You come back before noon. No. I am going to hospital. In case of emergency, call Dr Boule. He looked so good. See you doctor. See you. "Women. Always the same, with their children, their parents. "Still the same anxiety, the same guiltiness. "'What do you think, doctor ? "'Headache and fever, is it meningitis?' "'Fever and stomach ache, appendicitis?' "'Stomach ache and nausea, intestinal obstruction?' "'Nausea and headache, is it brain tumor?'" The phone rings. Play's medical office. I am listenning. Ah. Hello, Mrs Sachs. Very good. Thanks. No, sorry. He is busy. But I can reach me. Tell him to call me back in 5 minutes. Me? My God, like that. I am getting old. What about him, not so busy? A bit, but it would be worse if nobody was here. Goodbye, madam. I will tell him. You can rely on me. She thinks it is weird that the doctors in the hospital say she's not sick. If she had staid there, they would have gone to mountains. But him, his dog, his chickens... They left her go, but she feels something is bad. Ah, women. Sure about being the only ones to feel. "Doctor, I know what I am saying, I am her daughter." "I am her mother." They are lost, desperate. They are in deep shit now and they want you. When you come back, you will notice that cough, exhaustion, don't explain everything. The old man can't bear anymore that his daughter worries that much. And her child who doesn't eat vegetables brings lots of trouble for his mother. And when they see that you struggle... "Don't you do anything, doctor ?" "Yes. We'll make things easy." *Ah, women, all the same. always the same guiltiness. "What do you think about it, doctor ?" Mrs Pujade. Hello. What is planned? 3 interventions, 5 consultations. You are never on time. "In compliance of the article L. 162-3, 4 and 5 of Health Code, "Undersigned Bruno Sachs assures that Pauline Kasser..." Job? Drafter. That's a nice job. And administrative job. Nothing extraordinary. But... it's great... drafter. "...Pauline Kasser, living..." I've already given all the information. Sorry. I hate you because you are the one who will abort me. Normal And that you find it normal. You want to reassure and understand. You cannot. You are very angry. It happens to me too. It would be surprising. Indeed Really? What makes you angry? Everything and nothing It depends on the season, what I did that day, what I have to do. My evening : work or cinema. Next day : resting or working. The condition of my back, my feet.. I see. "Mrs Kasser had an interview "according to the article L. 162-3, 4..." I sign. Mrs Pujade, please let the first woman come. - Come, madam. Do you want to come in, Sir? He prefers to stay in the waiting room? Well. - Did someone explain you? I will tell you what I am doing bit by bit. It's over A few antiseptic compresses on the cervix of uterus... Is it ok? Do you feel dizzy No. Can I take a look, doctor ? There is nothing to see. It's shapeless and minuscule. Thanks, doctor. You have to rest I will come and see you. Does it hurt? - Yes. A bit. Not worse than childbirth. You really have the right to cry. I like him, Sachs. He helped my daughter give birth. It was her first one. The midwife showed her how to proceed. He was really nice. When the baby was born, he put it on my belly. He stayed beside me for a while looking at it, touching it. He was more seized with emotion than my husband. - I won't come. I am late. We don't say : "Please undress", and hup! It takes more than 5 minutes. That's my luck. I will come back. The last one? It didn't work at all. I have tried everything, you can believe me. It works for 3 days, and it's gone. Not possible to feel fine. It is starting to make me angry. And my husband gets mad, so... I don't understand we haven't found something yet. It runs in the family. My mother was also constipated. My daughter too. She doesn't want to admit it, but I know her. Well. You will try this. What? Some tribismuthed laxogene. I was sure about it. It's useless. Paraffin oil with prunes The same. The only one that works is Decelmol. Yes. It is said cancer-causing, but if it was bad, it wouldn't be on sale. And, constipated for years, it is not comfortable. Decelmol, 3 times a day during 6 months. Except that, are you ok? *- Any progress? Medecine can't stop making progress. But we are noticing... Allo. Oh, hello, my son. Fine. Always the same. I watched a tv program about contraception I am recording it for you. We can watch it on friday night. Is it still ok for you to come and eat on friday? You didn't calle me back. You got many consultations? Do you still have some time to write for your journal? I didn't receive the last one. Can you bring it to me? Mrs Leblanc is so sweet. I do agree. In the beginning, when the patients were expected, she was wondering if you kept on seeing her. She thought she would cost you a lot. By the way, your emergency, yesterday night, was it serious? Not anymore. He was dead. Once, I was wondering if you were preferring men. But I learned that homosexual men were very close to their mother. It made me feel better. You, you are standoffish, secret. You won't stay single all your life, though. What kind of woman would live in your village? Or a patient. Those who do it are damn idiots! Mom, people are waiting for me. Kisses. See you on friday. - Is it true? Is the beast strong? - On top form. But the last time, I had 34. Between 25 and 35, It is very good. Maybe you should measure my blood pressure. This, it means yes. You know, the young lady, there, the speech therapist, who made me speak again after my seazure, when I couldn't say anything else than "hello, hello", I cried all the time... My wife too, because we liked conversations. So, just "hello"... What...? Oh yeah. The young lady, her husband broke up. She is so nice... Well, physically. And a nice temper. We can be 75 year old, and still know how to appreciate a woman. This one, it would be a shame if she remains single. I was wondering : "I'll mention it to the doctor. Who knows." 14/8. Very good. The last time, it was 13. It is different, but it doesn't matter. You shouldn't complain You are 75, not 50. But I try to stay healthy. My prothrombin is healing. We don't struggle all life long not to cure. Concerning the blood test, write "at home" or I won't be paid back. I'll see you in one month? As usual, Mr Gu?not. - We are told not to spend money, that Health Service is going bankrupt. You, you have never told me anything about it. You know me better than if you saw me 3 times a year, and I feel safe like that. - I was fired one year ago. The grocer said... He said that a doctor moved in the old school building, and that he was looking for someone to take care of the phone calls. Here, you see. Play Medical Office. I am listenning Edmond? No, madam. Sorry. There is no Edmond here. I came and saw him, and do you know what he told me? "Someone told about you this morning. I was about to call you." Did you lose weight a lot? I cannot swallow anything so I don't eat anything. I will write a letter for a specialist. Bruno Sachs calling. I would like an appointment for a patient. No, it cannot wait until next week May I speak to him Hello, Philippe. Sorry to bother you. I would like you to see a new patient. Mr Guillou. Tomorrow, 11? All right. Thank you. Thanks again. He is a very good specialist. What is his speciality? Cancer? Yes, but it doesn't mean you have one. Of course. Of course. Anyway, thanks to your injection, the pain is much weaker. That's good. "Me." When I was a nurse intern, we had a patient who had a acute pancreatitis. He was rolling on the floor because of the pain. I told the houseman : "Isn't he acting?" He took me aside told me to change my profession. The next day, I wanted to apologize to him. He died during the night. Me. When I told a patient that her stomach aches could be psychological. I asked her husband to come and talk about it one hour a week, sometimes two, without any progress. One day, she called me : "I understood when I went to the toilets." It is not complicated to cure, a tapeworm. Since that day, she goes at Lavigney. Me. When someone told me what was said in the village : the night, at the medical office, I was aborting women because I didn't earn enough money. During a dinner... It was a long time ago. The hospital doctors didn't know what happened to a guy who lost 20 kg. And me : "No one loses 20 kg without any reason." His wife told me he had an uncurable cancer, and he didn't know about it. One day, I felt faint, in this caf?. I was sitting there. The boss called the firemen. I have been forced to go to the hospital. It really pissed me off. I was there, freezing, on an examination table, when a doctor came in the room He looked at me weirdly. And I thought: "Another one who is going to paw me." He gave me a bathrobe. "I'm the resident. What is happening to you ?" I told him everything : the troubles, didn't eat anything the day before, everything. He came out and came back with a hot chocolate and a sandwich. He checked my blood pressure, teared my file, helped me to get up, gave my dress. He smiled and told me "Go back to your home, sweetheart." He got red, and then left. That was him, at the right. - I won't ever be his patient. He doesn't seem clear, Sachs. I saw him looking at porn cassettes. - I don't want to see him again. He refused to give me medicine against cholesterol. "It is not as bad as cigarette." As far as I'm concerned, I just want to cure my cholesterol problem. I know better than him what I need. Who is this nuts ? Sorry to wake you up. You got a phone calle. It comes from Sainte-Sophie-sur-Tourment. It seems it is mentionned that you are the only doctor on watch tonight. An 8 months baby. He's got fever and is crying. Tell me, Catherine. I'm taking notes. Did she give him a bath ? No ? Too bad. She could have taken the opportunity to throw it with the bath water. Well. I'm going there. I'll call you when I come back. Mrs Bailly ? Ah, no. Pierre, come please. I am looking for Mrs Bailly, at la Bulle. Here, it is Bulle-Haute. Bulle-Basse... It's not here. To go there.. Just turn around. In 2 km, 1.5 km, at the cross roads, just go straight forward. Can you repeat ? *Bulle-Basse, it's there. The board, you can just see it later. Where are you going ? It's too cold outside. Are you nuts ? Have you found your way easily ? Sorry to bother you. I got worried. Didn't know who else to call. Are you alone with your child ? La Bulle-Basse, Mrs Bailly. The kid is fine, but the mother Has a lot of things to tell. She makes her husband pay for the baby, while he's having fun and leaving her with the baby. There is always a reason to see patients. The crazies, wasted, weird people. Give me examples. Who else ? The ones worried to spend a night alone : "I don't have parents, don't have friends. "My children are gone. My neighbours... "I need to talk to someone, or..." Allo ? I didn't go there for nothing. No other call ? Good night. I will sleep 2 hours. I could be better. I am too old for sleepless nights. Me neither. I was guessing something bad so I called my daughter so that she can search for him. My son-in-law was not happy, but he is her brother-in-law. Georges drinks too much. He prefers no one talks about it. Georges received his allowance yesterday. So he went outside and bought some wine. My daughter found him beside the road. A whole drama. I'd rather not to think about it. Now he is asleep. What about your ulcer? Did the nurse pass by ? She mostly took care of Georges. She's gonna come back. We can check it together Doctor, I need to tell you something. My daughter wants to lock Georges up. - What do you think about it? - I don't want, doctor. Georges is not a bad person. He is the only one who he can hurt. But his sister doesn't like him. She is ashamed of him And he is a tough guy. She is afraid of it. My son-in-law too. He is so small. But I would like to ask you... I am ashamed of it. It's bad form. But if it is possible... When I am dead, Don't let him being locked up, doctor. I know you cannot promise me anything, but I had to tell you. It's said now. - Your decision, it's complicated. We can talk about it - I don't think I can. - Do you have a child ? - A little girl, half cast. - Every children are half cast - Yes, it's true. I am a nurse. You think I am stupid. - Why ? - Being pregnant without wanting it. I should know. Being a carer is not a cure. Your decision, do you want to talk about it ? No. Did you talk with your gynecologist ? Nothing to declare ? Yes. Something unusual. I like you a lot. It is rare that I like a doctor. Do you oftern cause excitement to your patients ? Trying to charm them is not your type. Isn't it ? I come back from this creepy department realizing that I was fantasizing. That it was just emotion. Well, it wasn't. I would like not to like you anymore, but I still like you. I have a bad feeling about the situation, I think I will leave. I am said not to have feeling. I don't mind it. And the patient who falls in love with you, it doesn't bother you ? It's surprizing me. It doesn't bother me. I wished I would see you again today I don't think I would have said it to you. Please don't make fun of me. - I have lots of preconceived ideas. - Probably. You have my phone number, my address, even my birth date. And you, with the hospital, the Minitel, It's easy to contact me. - There is a lack of unexpected plans. - And mysteries. We can invent some. Don't call each other. And if we meet downtown, we leave together. Allright ? By the way, I want lots of children. Please wait, Mrs Renard. There is someone I want to call. Can I talk to you, Mrs Leblanc ? It's been a while that I want to know... Are you happy to work here ? Of course, doctor, I am happy. Very happy. Very good. Thank you, Mrs Leblanc. Yes ? You will laugh. It's just a little thing. Well.. ? It is just a little thing. But I have to be sure about it. I just wanted to ask you a little question. I could have called you. I was afraid to bother you. SO ? A little favour. The pharmacist told me it was only with prescription. The anesthetic gel you put on the skin before making an injection. Well, I don't have any injection to do, but... It's not easy to explain. My wife... How should I tell it ? She likes it a lot. Not the gel. But she likes it. So we do it everyday. Sometimes 2,3 times. So.. I don't refuse. I have got colleagues, their wife always have headaches, so... I cannot complain, but sometimes, it can burn terribly . Well, it burns. And also, I'd like to getting slower a bit, but she is terrible. Last day, on TV, they talked about the gel. They even give it to children, so it's not dangerous. I would like to use it. So that it won't be painful. You see ? I'm listenning. It won't be long. Some people are waiting It's just for a document. You came, when my brother was under the logger. The firemen said it was awful. He shouldn't have hanged the cage. He took it to clean the cattle-shed, and he forgot. So here it is. The insurance agent is asking for the cause of the death. You, you can tell them. But me, I mostly would like to know if he suffered. "Smitten nails, skins cut off... "Can we hear him scream from the outside ? "Pull up one's sleeve doesn't make it naked. "To be naked actually, it should..." It should... Too many books. There's no need for it. Bullshits ! Wasted time ! Glitzy ! Shits ! Doctor, that's enough. Read this, peacefully. - Hello. I am searching for "La Vacation" from Martin Winckler. There. Let me show you. [A book is falling] [The telephone is ringing] Allo. Who is this ? Ah, Colette. No. His car is still here. He didn't do anything this saturday. He didn't move. Actually... Since she is here, he changed. Yes. His... Well, the woman who is at his house. I have asked Mrs Borg?s, his cleaning woman. She is the sister-in-law of a brother-in-law of Pierre, the cousin of my husband. She just said she is nice. I cannot stay stuck to my window too... Well, here they are. Finally, he comes out. She does too. Look, he is driving her car. Admit that it's better than his... Since his clientele got better, he could have changed his car. I don't know what they are talking about. He is not in a hurry. Here it is. He left. You will see him soon. No. There was some, but they just passed by. But I've never seen two times the same one. She isn't one of them. She spents the night there everyday. What is she doing ? Listen, it's not usual. She is in the flower-bed, digging. Yes, like I said Breathe. Here it is. It should have hurt. Tell me, Mr P?rec... how is it possible to stick a hook in your own finger ? What can I do for you ? You are on guard, but I actually hoped you were not here. I finished my consultations. For now. - Maybe not. Sorry - Should I leave ? Dr Sachs. Listenning ? Yes, mom. It's sunday, but I am on guard. And there is a patient. At house, she was my friend, not a secretary. I'll call you back. I'm listenning. I am sorry. I shouldn't have come. Actually yes. I needed to talk. I am not sick... Not like your other patients. Sorry. It seems complicated. Yes. And very usual at the same time. There is just one man in my life. If you can call it a life. He is married. I cannot bear it anymore. And today is sunday so you didn't see him. No, no. It's not like that. I see him on sundays. Today, he visited his family-in-law for form. When he does this, I would like to kill both of them. His wife goes and play cards, at the thalassotherapy. I see her there. She is spending lots of money there. It's hard for me not to insult her. Concerning him, I don't know why he is still with her. He said he doesn't touch her anymore. - Do you think he is lying? - No. He is too sensitive, too... It's complicated. - He has a daughter. - How old is she ? 17. When we met, she was just 8. He doesn't see her a lot. - But you see him often ? - Yes. I work at home. It's discreet. - And with his job... - He is a salesman ? Sorry. It's really disjointed. You can't do anything. When he's leaving like that, I am ready to break up. He called me. It's easy with mobile phones. What did you say ? Nothing. He feels bad to see me like that and pretending. I am fed up with waiting that he leaves his fucking wife and daughter ! - I am sorry. - No, it's all right. I can't control myself. That's why I came here. Thank you to have listenned to me. I feel embarrassed. "Embarrassed" ? Why ? I am making you busy without being sick. No, but you are in pain. I didn't tell you my name. You didn't ask for it. I am listenning. Sorry to have bothered you on sunday. We have a shop so are very busy. Here it is. I wanted to talk to you about my brother. Your "brother" ? Georges. He lives with his mother, Mrs Destouches. Yes. We are worrying for my mother. She is tired, and with Georges... What is it ? You know he is drinking. He is dirty. It's not possible anymore, for him to live with her. Your mother doesn't want him to leave. She is very close with him. Of course : he is a weight. But my husband and I, took our decision. We came to agree with you. "Agree with me" ? He will have to detox. And if my mother goes to hospital because of her ulcers while he is there , we would tell her, that we had to bring Georges. "Bring" where ? You understood. We just have to lock him up. You would just have to sign a certificate. Coming from you, my mother would accept. Psychiatrists words are meaningful. My sister-in-law works there. They will keep him the time to find a solution. "A solution" ? Well yeah. Georges est un parasite qui s'accroche ? maman. It's enough. You understand ? Yes. I won't lock your brother up or leave your mother at the hospital. But... Goodbye, Madam, Mister. "Life is hell. "little by little, we learn it. "When another body interferes, if there is no love, "hell is double." "I saw lots of women, their thighs tight, with their bag on them, "cursing a husband, who sleeps in front of the TV, "when he's not cheating, then goes to bed, tired. "And when their wife finally goes to bed, "after having hung the washed clothes and administrated a suppository to her daughter, "their husband look at them, with eyes closed, "sticking their nose to their wife's face, taking off their pyjama... "'No need to talk more about it, doctor. You know how men are.' "I saw many men whispering, writing their cheque, "that they would like to play football again, or build maquettes. "'But on saturdays, "'we go shopping, and my wife doesn't like to drive. "'And on sundays, it's not possible too. "'Lunch at my step-mother's. So maquettes..." "'And even if I use newspaper, "'she thinks it's dirty. "'A little drop of glue, and she yells at me. "'But under the blanket... Well, let's talk about something else. "'She wants me to be nice, that I talk to her. "'But what she wants, is that I let her talk. "'You know what I mean. You know women.'" I must seem like a bastard with my texts. Yes. But I can live with that. Do you often write your thoughts about humanity ? She whistles. This kind of things What is the medical word for that ? An addiction ? Une maladie ? Or a remedy ? - Aren't you afraid ? - I am not. But you are You always listen to people It's also your right to express yourself by writing. Please read me some. "During the pediatric internship, "there was a 8 or 9 year old boy "who always shitted in his pants. "Not because he held it, but because he held it too much, "so much that he couldn't feel anymore what was inside him. "Because of the accumulation, it came out so easily. "I skip the details and how we tried to re-educate him. "According to our psychologist, "it is often the consequence of a bad relationship with the mother. "I didn't want to believe him. Until the day I saw the mother." - What are you doing here ? You are bothering us now ! Go to your bedroom ! "She didn't behave at all like a mother with her child. That day, "for the first time, I had a terrible feeling." What I have just felt with kicking out another scum : an uncontrollable hate, making me shake a lot. Where does his girlfriend come from? She pretends like a star with her black sun glasses. She may be one. - Eat your croissant. - I am not hungry. Jean-Yves, talk to her. Sweetheart, drinking Coke during breakfast makes your mother angry. A such small appetite, it is so sad. I'll bring her to the doctor, so that he can convince her to eat more. And I will talk about me and Jean-Yves. It's a shame that he cannot make me have an orgasm. A croissant ? With butter or classic ? This morning : a young girl for a vaccine. Her belly makes me sure about something. So I ask : How many months ? Then I think I might be wrong, And I told her : I will check you up. It was not a dream. - I won't vaccinate again. - No ? Why ? - There are risks during pregnancy. - May I put my close back on ? Yes. How much is it ? - Do you want me to fill the documents for the pregnancy ? - No. How much is it ? I didn't want her to pay. She insisted. I didn't know what to do. - Annie is fine. She has become an angel again. I took her to see Dr. Sachs. I couldn't bear it anymore. She was irritable, aggressive. She was reluctant about going there. - Come on, you make everybody wait. - You piss me off! - I was so ashamed ! Even if I was used to her nervous breakdowns. Yet, I make lots of efforts to make her feel happy. In vain I tell the doctor : - My daughter doesn't eat anymore. - Stop saying bullshits. I pretended not to hear. And explained... She grew up without putting on weight. She won't be as tall as her father ! And with a smile, the doctor said : Tall women are beautiful. - I sighed so that he understands I was not worrying about that. I don't know what is wrong. She is 14 and still doesn't have her period. With the same facial expression, he said : What bothers you ? So I got angry : Everything ! She doesn't eat. Say that you can not swallow anything. Annie, I am talking to you. She doesn't want to talk to me. She has the hump even if she has everything. I cannot understand. Me, her mother. Until 18, she should respect and obey. And even later. Authority, with teens... During highschool, she was nice except in my classroom. - She was your pupil ? - From the elementary school. I moved to her other school for her when she finished elementary school. It was a chance for us. Her father didn't have a permanent job. It was just before I kicked him out of our house. - He didn't know how to take care of her. - Mom ! I talk about your father, and now your react. It's my right. I have supported him long enough. I never said something bad about him. Miss, could you leave us alone please ? - He made her go out. I was upset. I told him about how we broke up. It was my decision, but I have suffered. I usually see Dr. Boule, but Annie doesn't like him. Sorry Doctor, I am so upset about what is happening to my daughter. She just has me. And now... And her father, He doesn't come and visit her anymore. - She doesn't see him? - She does. She sees him, but the less, the better. I told her the years that her father wasted. - And Annie's "runaway" - A runaway ? She left highschool without saying anything to anyone. I drop her at school at 8, even if my lesson starts at 11. She doesn't realize how lucky she is. A teenager who disappear for 3 hours, it is called a runaway. He always does "hum hum". It's annoying. And then, he dares asking me : Does she eat at her father's ? - I gave a sickly smile. I have been said that her girlfriend cooks well. So I answer : It would surprize me. And she doesn't go there so often. I quickly say : Is she anorexic ? Could you cure her ? If you don't mind, I would like to see Annie alone. - I had to leave his office. Yes. Please, come. - What does he know about teenagers ? He will be bored after 5 minutes. But believe me or not, she stayed there for one hour. I am not kidding. He asked me to come back. He was clear, firm. And he said : You should conside the situation as serious. We talked a lot. - She was transformed. I was shocked. He made me pay for 2 persons, but it was worth the price. Anyway, my insurance gives the money back. We are friends now. Thank God, she is not into flirting things. A "little crisis" ? I have suffered. You, you don't have any child. She is not a teacher. I sometimes see some of them correcting tests here. I saw her working at the sub-prefecture, She waits him there. She is dating the Play's doctor. He does some abortions here. Yes, he helped me. I was pregnant. I couldn't keep it. Kind, and also smart. All doctors are not like him. And he looks good. It was weird that he lived alone. Here it is, they are two now. The first arrived waits for the other one. They do piss me off, with loving each other like that. Being that much in love. She doesn't simper. And he is careful. When he is in a bad mood, she doesn't behave like his mother. And when she is, he is present too. They talk a lot to each other. They are very close and they use the polite form of address to each other. Can you believe it ? Like in old movies. Look. It seems they are about to leave, go to her flat, close to the ring road, racing upstairs. she lets her thighs sliding between his. In less than one minute, they are naked. She has a huge dark bed. They stick to each other. She loves it, that's for sure. When he holds her and looks at her, it drives her crazy. Their desire pisses me off but they are my only sunshine. Anyway, I'll serve them before they leave. They piss me off, but I only have them, so I take care of them. - I went to his cabinet before. - I still go. At noon, there is no one. The last time, he told me : "You always come at noon." I didn't like it. I won't come back there anymore. - We met before, it was a sunday. - I remember. This time, it concerns my son. Dr Boule told me to call you. What's wrong ? Answer, sweetheart. With Dr Boule, it's easy : he gave birth to him. - Where does it hurt ? Here. And how long did it hurt ? It's been two days. And today, his temperature was 38.2. Can I check you up ? - Like J?r?me ? - Ok - "J?r?me" is Dr Boule. - I know. How does J?r?me start ? "OK-doc." Tell me, fella, what's your name ? J?r?me. Like Dr Boule. One day, I'll be doctor. I told him about my visit. And he told me : "Sachs is very discreet. He is the one who you can talk to." I needed to talk. It's so unreal, sometimes. - Having a child is a reality. - Yes, it's a fact. I am leaving. Can I leave him with his baby-sitter ? - No problem. - And she is serious. Goodbye, J?r?me. Eat some ice cream. It's good for curing angina. - Bye. - Bye, doctor. Bye Annie... I am 15. I want to live with my father. I will visit Mr. P?rec. I have already told him. Annie, please. You are angry, because your mother feels free to talk about you with a stranger : me. But I hate her. I can't even bear her odor. She stinks by the way. I don't care about what she told you. She is lying.. If I reply her. she starts to cry. The bullshits she said about my father are not true. He left because he was fed up with her. I want to leave too.. Last week... "Last week" ? I was at my brother's birthday. She always say : "Your stepbrother." Because I used the bus alone, she said I ran away. She is such an idiot ! You cannot do anything for me. I am not sick. You are right. You are not sick. Hating one's mother is not a disease. - What do you want ? - Go and live with my father. See my brother growing up. She said that if I make the request, she'll talk to the judge, and daddy will get troubles. Waiting to be 18 with her, it's like hell. You won't wait First, calm her down : I will give you a prescription. Avoid to make her angry. If the things get complicated, go and see Mr P?rec and tell him I sent you. P?rec. From now on, I keep my nose clean, stay polite. - So, Annie, will you come ? I am the sick one. The doctor is healthy, Shut up, J?r?me. I am coming, sweetheart. I have trusted your advice. - Putting the enemy to sleep ? - Yes. You were the only one to refuse to lock Georges up. I would like to thank you... and tell you something. Georges is not my husband's son. He is the son of some I loved a lot. I have said it to no one, except this man. Then my husband. And now you. My children don't know. But it seems like they guessed And are taking their revenge. - Do you think it's possible ? - Yes. The children break through their parents' mysteries and rarely forgive. Your newspaper. Hello, doctor Mr. Merle. - How are you Mrs. Destouches ? - Fine, thanks. They are jealous of each other, but both agree to hurt me. Georges shouted that he left the field to his sister, that he could live with the allowance, that it would be better for me to be alone. I didn't answer anything. He knows I didn't want him to go away. Don't you get bored now ? No. People are coming : the mailman, my daughter, every evening, as if she needed to be forgiven, just before eating, with her husband. Concerning him, he just stays in his car. When she comes, I turn on the TV and pretend to be interesting in watching something I don't want to talk to her anymore. She knew it. Georges is Georges, but still, I miss him. And I cannot get used to the fact he is locked up. When my husband had cirrhosis, he didn't sleep. It was hell. The doctor gave me some pills for him so that he could sleep. One day, he didn't wake up. I didn't throw the pills, in case I would need them. Well. Since that time, they must be outdated, but to use them for what I want... Snoring in front of TV That's funny. Weird but funny. I didn't hear the car. Are you all right ? You don't seem ok. What's wrong ? The cassette. It's medical. It's professionnel. It's a professionnal secret. It's full of breadcrumb. [He bursts out of laughing] "Jean-Yves really wanted to record our wedding night on tape, "with the camera his friends "offered him. "He wanted to record the bed on tape, but he didn't set up the camera well. "We can hear Jean-Yves during 78 seconds. "Then he falls asleep. We can hear him snoring for 178 minutes. "It just started, and it's already finished. "So I have decided to talk about it with a doctor." If I were you, I would forget the sexuality of.. [Snoring] and I would take care of Pauline's sexuality. Do you want to have a bath ? Mr. Deshouli?res will maybe call. - I'll have to put my clothes back... - This is risky indeed. My first published text urged the other doctors to look, not only on women's breasts, but also in men's sleep. Testis cancer, hypospadias, scrotum empty or getting bigger, phimosis, cysts on spermatic cord, mycosis, anaphia... But who would want to take a look at it ? Me, me, me. You don't know women. "Diseases' "go by the name of the first one who observed or described them, "never the first one who suffered from them. "It shows how much the disease belongs to the doctor, his caste." It's gross. You pretended to be asleep. - "You know how men are." - But I forgot. I forgot. Yeah. Let's forget. Let's forget. Let's forget the emaciated bodies, obese bodies, pustular bodies, sweating bodies, twisted bodies, desirable bodies, or grungy and smelling log fire, white bodies under a tanned face, nauseant bodies, bodies scarred by surgeons, or pain twisted sticky or burnt bodies, groaning bodies... [Phone ringing] [Cicada records] She is gone peacefully. I will turn down the volume. My wife comes from the south of France. She would have liked to come back there. I have found a cassette : Atmosphere from the South. In the end, I played the cassette. She is gone with the sounds from there. Will you listen to this cassette again ? Probably, yes. - Sorry, I was nervous. - It was a rabbit crossing the road. It was a very dangerous curve. twice a year, a car hits the pylon. Because I live close to here, they call me. A survey about doctors has been done. The conclusion is not so shiny. Doctors take drugs, run away, don't have great sex, can be big-time gamblers, hit or abandonned their relatives... When they cannot bear anymore their stupid life, they commit suicide. It's late. - Why do you do this ? - Do what ? Listenning to your watch when you have sorrows. When I was a child, and got hurt when I fell, or if I was sad, my father took me in his arms. And I listenned to the sound of his watch. It's an automatic watch. It loads itself when it is carried. Once he was sick, he didn't carry it anymore. I did, during the night. It never stopped, but he died anyway. I am not alone so often. She goes and see her niece on wednesdays. It's hard, isn't it ? She irritates me. "Is it possible to suffer that much ?" If I vex her, she will complain : "Hey now, you are not nice to me." Everything is about her. Someone visits her, and she complains about me : "Marcel did this, did that to me. Poor me." 14/8. Perfect. My legs don't carry me like they did before. Before, I went in the woods. Good days. If I become a cripple, depending on her, she will call the whole neighbourhood : "My God, what did I do to deserve this ? "Poor me." You want something to drink ? And when she put me on diet ! No wine, no fat, nothing. And you told her : "Do you want to kill him ?" - Her doctor arguing with her... - We should defend ourselves. I love when you check her up strongly. "Here, does it hurt ?" And she : "Yes, yes." You push : "And there ?" "Ouch, ouch." And you make it last longer. And I think : "Do it, so that she can feel the pain." I enjoy it, a kind of revenge. She is such a burden ! I thought about something. If I become a cripple, I'd prefer dying alone. Before, no one did it, but now, doctor, I am thinking about divorce. These are the test results for Mrs. Reverzy. There is an insurance document with it. It's personnal, for Dr Boule. You should send it back. Yes, but it's surprizing that he left this paper without realizing its presence. It is a life insurance. Yes, doctor, but not for Dr. Boule. Maybe he left it for you on purpose. - Did you know he had... - A lover What we know or don't, is not worth giving importance. I am going. People are waiting today. I always clean the toilet seat. I have a perfect private hygiene. And I just had affair with my husband, so I don't know how... Breathe deeply. - What do you feel ? - I feel some mistakes. How long did the pain last ? Two hours. It woke me up. Let's check you heart condition. You will be the next one. - Hello, Mrs. Leblanc - Mr. Gu?not. I won't bother the doctor. I just came to renew my prescription, for my prothrombin. - I'll come back - Thank you. Ah. Concerning the blood sample, Please ask him to mention "done at home", or else I won't have my money back. - I'll tell him. - Thanks. Goodbye. Bye sir. These are rumours, but the doctor is not gonna leave, isn't he ? Now that he is not single anymore. I hope not. He would have told you. Far from it, he is thinking about hiring a replacement once a week. Well. Better like that. I had a heart attack, right ? Your heart needs mors oxygen. I am calling an ambulance. No, doctor. I won't go there. - Of course you will. - It's too late. It's ok like that. I want to die at home, peacefully. Not at the hospital. - And your wife ? - I was scared to lose her. She is young. Healthy. Nothing bad can happen to her. If it does, I couldn't bear it. I lost my first wife and my son in a car crash. I thought I couldn't live without them, then I met her. It saved my life. But I couldn't experience it again. And it won't : I will die first. I feel relieved, almost happy. How much do I owe you ? My son was called Bruno. I am glad to have seen you, doctor. Hello. How are you, Amandine ? - Hello. - What can I do for you ? - I don't know. I'm not sure. I came here because I had to come one day or another. It cannot continue. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Allo? Who am I talking to, Sir? What's happening to you? Calm down, Or I cannot help you. Where is she? Or her bed or on the floor? On the side. You did it right. - Where do you live? - Are you busy? - No - Come here! Yes. I will. But tell me where. Fine. I'm coming. Sorry. There is an emergency. Will you wait me to come back? I have to go back home. I'll come back. It's been six months that I am waiting. So 3 days... - What are we celebrating? Your birthday and your love. Viviane, drink with us. Ah. Yes, yes. Usually, Bruno is charmed by chronic depressive girls, victims begging for help. Pauline is the exception. And she cares about your birthday. You are blessed. Congratulations! Viviane. What a surprise, colleague! So, are you hanging out? Doctor Boule, Pauline. Good evening. Some friends. - Champagne? It's my birthday. - I would prefer a whisky. Thanks. - By the way, I was about to call you. You argue with my replacement, concerning a terminally larynx tumor. Mr. Guillou. On sunday I was not working,his wife didn't want to bother me so she called your replacement. A huge tumor. And she said : "It's nothing, it will be ok." It seems you told her she's a bitch. She always makes things up! No. I said she is a bitch. An irresponsible and sadic bitch. They had the clinical file. She ignored it. Is it true you wished her to have an ovaries tumor so that she understands? Possible. I was angry. You should fire her. She sucks. You are cute. You are still young. I forgot we could care about patients that much. We express it differently. That's it. I'm leaving. My wife is waiting for me. She hates doctors. We should put up with it. Don't you bear doctors a grudge? Yes, I do. Some of them. Unlucky. Double one, for the road. - It was a nice evening. - Mm-mm. Bruno, sometimes you are annoying me. You didn't enjoy tonight? - Was it obvious? "Mm-mm." [Phone] Yes. Good evening, captain. I know you are not on call tonight. No. It was not kids, this time. The ambulance is here, but you should come. He's pretty bad. A friend of yours. Who? I am coming. Does someone want to ring Mrs. Boule, and tell her that he directly hit the pylon ? - Were you at the funeral? - Yes. It was crowded. Even if it was so rainy. Let us drive you back home. - What about you? - I was not there. No. An appointment? Just tell him that since last time, I am much better. But the doctor was in such a hurry, it came out of my mind. I forgot to pay for my consultation. [Phone] Excuse-me. Allo, Edmond? Answer, Edmond. Please, Edmond! Allo? Allo, Edmond? Edmond Sirling? Himself. Good evening. I am calling from Play's medical cabinet. We have been receiving phone calls from an old worried woman asking for Edmond. I made investigations. My last phone numbers are 83 and you 38... - She is asking for Edmond? - Yes. It's my mother. I always thought she was calling the doctor, when she was found dead. It's been 20 years. I think she won't call anymore. I think so too. Thanks, madam, to have look for me. Goodbye, madam. One night - I was still a non-resident student - I was taking care of a premature baby, a little cute 7 months 1/2 old thing, laying in a box with pipes everywhere, his legs and arms tied to the 4 corners of the box. He was trying so hard to put his fist in his mouth. I untied the baby. That was forbidden. He could have ripped the intravenous infusion out. But he just wanted to suck his fist. I told him stories, sang songs. Every 4 hours, I had to give him an intramuscular injection. After the first one, he screamed. Writhing in pain. I thought I killed him. I didn't know if would hurt him that much. I didn't give him the other injections. I emptied the needles into the sink. I often listenned to the incubator, and I was only breathing when I heard him breathe. I had to touch him the less I could. At sunrise, I took off my gloves, washed my hands for 10 minutes, and slid them along his body to caress it. His hand took one of my finger, and his fist pulled it to his mouth to suck it. I looked at him and couldn't stop crying. I won't have any child. I don't want to see them suffering. Don't want to see them suffering. I don't want to drive, or coming back. Let's make love? Except you have something else to propose. How many chance to get pregnant, with a failure of intra-uterine device? - 0,5 % I can take the risk. I can have an abortion anyway. Certainly not. You deny your need of a child, not its presence. You don't make sense. We'll have children. You'll see them suffering. Tonight, be yourself, be imaginative. "I shall cure the underdog for free. "I won't demand an excessive salary. "Invited by people, my eyes won't look around me. "My tongue will keep the secrets I have been trusted. "My position won't be used to corrupt moral standards or encourage murders. "Showing respect to my masters, I will give to their children "the instruction brought by their fathers. "Please consider me if I keep my promises. "If I don't, bring shame on me "and despise from my colleagues." Is it a beginning or an end? A beginning.
