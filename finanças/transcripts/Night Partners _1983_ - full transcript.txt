Are you thinking of a famous?? No, no, I'm not thinking of Trevethin. Who? Trevethin? Who is Trevethin? I can't play this game. I feel so stupid. Hey, I didn't say it. Uh, my turn, are you a famous athlete? Yes. Yes, I'm thinking of a famous athlete. Got it. Wayne Terwilliger? No, but that's a great guess. Who is Wayne Terwilliger? Mom, could you hand me a soda, please? Uh-huh. Thank you. Coming up on on it,Throneberry, Marv Throneberry. That's it. Marvelous Marv. Very good. Give the man a cigar. Thank you, yeah. First baseman for the Mets retired in '63. If you had given me two moreminutes, I could have got it. - Yeah. - We believe you. Hang on, Sam. OK, there you go. Watch your thumb, babe. Sam, boy, you're heavy. No, honey, let's do all this tomorrow. Come on, Sam. Good night, Sam. OK, kids. Bye, Francine. All right, here you are. - Thanks, Glen. - Good night, hon. Come on, kids. Goodnight. Good idea. Up you go. Boy, you're getting so big. I think you weigh more when you're sleeping. You'll be in bed in a minute, I promise. You have a big day atschool tomorrow, don't you? There we go. Oh, boy. I'm exhausted. What the heck is that this late? I don't know. I'll get it. Elizabeth. I don't know who it could be. Open up. Honey, it's Lauren. What? Lauren, what is it? There were men. In your house? Are they still there? - I don't know. - What happened? What's going on? Sam, go back to your room. Honey, call the station. Get a couple of guys over here. Come on, let me put something on that. I don't know. I looked, Phil. I don't know, we both got-- Then what happened? Then one of the guys, the one with the beard came in from the hall and grabbed us when we were at the door. I struggled with him. And-- and he hit me. And then I fell. And that's when I hit my headon the dining room table. Did they strike you again? Or did they hurt you in any other way? No, no. I was so scared. Describe them for me. Start with the one with the beard who came from the hallway. He was tall. How tall? I don't know. About six feet. Fat, thin, what? Stocky. Caucasian, Black, what? White, white, they were both white and they both were t-shirt--- Henderson-- And jeans and-- and-- I think I found it. Mark? OK. Hey, Lauren. You're doing fine, hon. Is he angry with me? It's not personal. Henderson is like that with everybody. But he's still a damn good cop. Well, it's pretty clear to us they came in through the sliding windows there in the dining room. Now they don't look jimmied. Did you leave them open? I don't know, maybe. I'm sorry, I don't think about these things. I mean, this is Bakersfield. Yeah, this is Bakersfield. And if I were you, I'd getbetter locks all around. All right, somebody will be in touch. The other officers will be around here for another half hour or so. And then what? And then I file a report. Will you catch them? There isn't much to go on. See you around, McGuire. Anderson. I think you better spend the night with us. What are we waiting for? We better get this cleaned up. You first. Let's start with Josh's room Iwant it to be clean by the time he comes home from school. OK. Oh, no. Hey. Nobody has the right to do this to us. I know. I wish I could think of something to make you feel better. I can just say that I think the police are gonna do the best they can. Oh, the police. Elizabeth, I didn't mean anything about Glen. I know. If it hadn't been for you and Glen last night, I would have been completely lost. It's just, that guy Henderson. Yeah. He made me feel like Iwas one of the eight million stories in "The Naked City." It's not supposed to happen here. Why not? Is it any safer here? No. Hey, listen, why don't weget this all cleaned up and go eat something. You'll feel better. OK? Glen, there's no excuse for it. Henderson didn't care whatshe was going through. Honey, he sat down with her, he talked to her. I know he did. But it's not enough. How you turn this thing off? It is off. Just open it. You know, I never have liked this thing. All I'm saying is, someoneshould have cared besides us. Honey, we see people hurt every day, hurt in ways you can't even imagine. If we start feeling sorryfor everybody, we'll go nuts. Now let's face it, no one person can possibly know what's going on, even undertheir own nose, all the time. And that's why it's important to establish a good, close network. Now usually we call it the neighborhood watch. Now the tighter this networkis and the more complete it is, the better chance you have of preventing crime in your neighborhood. You should exchange names andphone numbers of everybody in your immediate area. Did I miss much? Practically the whole thing. Babysitter was late. Did you bring up the subject yet? No, they're still talking about neighborhood watch and crimeprevention and stuff like that. Maybe they can get the tag number and the type and color of the automobile. Now, in helping you establish this network-- What are you doing? I'm going to bring up the subject. Before you leave tonight Please don't embarrassGlen in front of his boss. --methods of organization, in addition to that. Uh, Lauren? Well, I know you've beentalking about crime prevention here tonight. But I'll bet there are a lot of us who had a crime happen to them already. I was the victim of a violentcrime a few nights ago. And I was lucky enough tohave friends who stood by me and helped me through it right after it happened. Because, boy, police suredidn't help in that department. Hey, lady, the police are on our side. What's your problem? She's got a point. I know the police are on our side. Yeah, they did their job. But, boy, was it cold. So what's your point? Well, my point is, I-- I just wish there wassomeone to take care of us. We're talking about crime prevention. Let her talk, it's important. Yeah. Let her talk. I think that as victims we deserve more help from the policedepartment than we're getting. I agree. Thank you. She's right. The man who snatched my purse, he had help. They gave him an attorneyand a social worker. Well, that's how America works. And I think that's good. But what about me? Nobody even offered me a ride home. She's right. They never do that. What we're talking abouthere is victims' rights. Now, I know you don't want to hear this, but the system is set up to protect the rights of the criminal. You're not answering the question. I really believe that there should be someone there to help the victim. We're people with feelings and fears. And we need some support. We need someone to help usthrough the emotional mess. Look, I agree with you. Victim advocacy is a great idea. There's only one problem, my men barely have enough time to work the number of cases they already have. You f the chief of police. Why don't you just hire more men? That's right. Because we don't have the money. See, a program like that justisn't in this year's budget. It would require morepeople, specialized training. Well, if you think it's a good idea, then why don't you ask for volunteers. Yeah, why don't you getvolunteers from the community? That'd be great. You know, I'd like to see a program like that here in Bakersfield. But who would donate thatkind of time and energy? Anyone here care to volunteer? Would you? Yes. Yes, I would. Absolutely. I'll do it. I'll do it. And so will my friend. She'll do it, too. She will. You're a housewife? Yes. I have a little boy and I have a job. I'm a secretary. But I'm willing to work around it. How? Well, I already have awoman who looks after my son. And I'm sure she wouldn'tmind helping me a little more. And what about you, Elizabeth? How does your family feel about this? Well, I haven't talked to them yet, but I don't see any reason why they would-- She's willing to do it. Who'd be against an idea like this, huh? Huh? I look across my desk and all I see are a couple of housewives that don't know what they volunteered for. Sure we do. No, you don't. See, we're going to spenda lot of time and money getting you ready to hit the streets. You're going to be cold. You're going to be tired. You're going to be bored. You're going to be repulsedby some of what you see. And my little housewivesare going to call it quits. Don't patronize us. We're serious. I don't like what I went through. And there's no reasonthat we can't help to make it better for other people. I don't like quitters. We're not gonna quit. All right. Then we'll get you trained. Trained? Fine. Here's how it goes. Tomorrow you report to the Academy. Police Academy? But all we want to do is help people. You do it my way or not at all. See, I'm talking about lawsuits. You're going to train withthe cadets, a mini course. You're going to get into physical shape. You're going to learn some defensive tactics, a little psychology, some law, radio, codes, and how to handle yourselflike a professional, maybe even how to use a gun. No, no guns. But all the rest. That sound good to you? Wonderful. Our problem on the east side,gentlemen, seems to continue. Another rape last night. Same MO, breaking and entering a trailer, woman threatened with a knife. Naturally, this kind of thingis getting a lot of media play. And the town's getting scared. As of today, Roy Henderson willhead up a special task force. Meanwhile, we're beefing up our uniformed patrols on the east side. OK, any questions? I hear there may be aninspection tomorrow, Zegger? Before you leave, I'd liketo introduce our new victim volunteer advocacy program. So these women will be working with you to help victims in some way wehaven't fully figured out yet. Some of you may know Elizabeth McGuire. This is Lauren Hensley. I'd like you to welcome them to the department. We're going to need aliaison between these women and the department. Any volunteers? Thank you, Joe Kirby. Nice draw, Kirby. Well, that's it. We're underway. Good luck, Kirb. Coming with me? Yeah. Good luck. We were a hit. That's it. They're all in. No, it's not. Come on, Eddie, give 'em a break. Joe, I have cadets to train. I can't wait on these women all day. This is what you'll be usingwhen you leave your unit. For police purposes, the city of Bakersfield is divided into two separatefrequency channels, Bakersfield and East Bakersfield. This dial will adjust those frequencies. Here's your mic button. I want you to take a look at thecode books I just handed out. There are over 100 codes. Memorize them. Is he kidding? Especially, the codes on rape, family fights, and most important, help, 999. If you can't remember that,three clicks on the mic button will do. Close the door behind you, Josh. Where you want me to put this, mom? Thanks. Are you asleep? Joe, what are we doing here? There may be a time you'llbe answering a code 3. That's the official reason. The real reason is the Chief'sworried you'll run down a newsstand and he'll be sued. A code three is respond with lights and siren. Oh, come on, will you getthose codes memorized. Yeah, we will. We will, Joe. OK, turn it over. Now, if you're going to get the full benefit of this exercise, I think you're going to have to go a little faster. Joe, did I scratch the car. Just keep your hands on the inside of the wheel, no hand over hand. Now, keep your speed up. You know, I don't think you're supposed to be knocking those cones over. How'd I do, Joe? Joe? Now, you'll never be on the scene of a crime before a policeman has been there. That means only apoliceman can call you in. So we can't just show up afterhearing something on the radio? You got it. This is a volunteer programfor the police as well. They have to request you before you're assigned. Well, Glen will call us. I think he will. Stop being paranoid. I'll call you. Others will too. So if we're not the first ones there, we don't have to worry aboutanybody going crazy on us? Not so fast. A cop has to call you in. But once he's determined thesituation is under control, he's gonna split. Then we'll be on our own? That's right. Now nine out of ten times, you'll be dealing with a victim in a confined area. Now, this means someone'sapartment and someone's home. Now there are some basic procedures I want you to know and remember. Now, one-- We understand you two have had an argument, and the officer thought perhaps we could help you straighten it out. Now, don't forget to look around the room. OK, look, at what you're getting yourself into. Do you see a gun? Do you see a knife? Do you see any signs of violence? Joe, you said there'd be a cop waiting for us. Now, wouldn't he have checkedthis stuff out already. Probably, but you've got to learn to depend on yourself always. Is there anyone else here? Just my baby. Well, I think we should all sit down. Why don't you sit there and-- Good to get them seated. Well, remember, this is a follow up on a 931 with a report of assault. OK. Now, why don't you tell us what the problem was here tonight? He hit me. She's blaming the whole thing on me-- He hasn't got any right to hit me. - I work my butt off.- You didn't clean the place up. - I'll say. - I come home-- And then he comes home at night. Is the place clean? And he comes home and starts yelling-- I look at the place, it's not cleaned up. - --at the baby and me.- The baby's in there screaming. - The baby-- - So-- Something tells me we blew it. It's all out of control. Now, first you got toset up some ground rules. Only one person talks at one time. No cutting in. You've got to make them understand that you're here to help them reach an agreement, not to help them argue. And there is no name calling, that clear? Now what? We find out what it isthey want from each other and what concessions they're willing to make. Good. What do you want from Eddie? I want him to respect me. Well, we can work on that. But what do you want from Eddie now? I want him to stop hitting me. Now, when you're on duty, youwear slacks and closed shoes. And remember, no heroics. Now, you never get out of the car unless there's a policeman there first. 2 Able 5, 10-20. Go ahead answer it, Elizabeth. Is that for us? Mm-hm. I thought it was static. Hello? Repeat. Come on, Elizabeth, there's a code for that. 10-9. 10-9. 2 Able 5, 10-20. Euclid and Speedway. Good. 10-4. Now, when you're off duty,you'll be given a pager. And we'll beep you if there's an emergency. Other than that, I don't know what to tell you. When do we start? Tomorrow. Don't do this to me, Andy. Without that child supportpayment, I can't make it. Don't put me in a positionwhere I have to beg. All right, just send me what you can. Uh, it's-- it's only threenights a week, Mrs. Murphy. Oh, not just this week, it'll be every week. It's a second job for me, only without pay. Eat. Oh, from about 5:00 to1:30, 2:00 in the morning. Don't hang up on me, Mrs. Murphy. How much? Oh, I-- I can't pay that much. It's volunteer work. You know what happens to kidswho have mothers that work? Sure, they have moreresponsibilities at home. That's not how I heard it. No? How did you hear it? Dope, malnutrition. That lip. I just don't see how youcould agree to those hours, mom. I had no choice, Francine. Apparently, those are the peakhours people are in trouble. Well, what are you botheringwith other people's troubles for? What about us? Listen, kids, this is going to work. Good, you're home. Foods on the stove and the children know exactly what to do. All you have to do is get thestew out of the microwave. How will I know when it's off? Because it dings. Hey, what's the matter with you? I knock myself up forweeks getting ready for this. And nobody, I meannobody gives me any help. They're kids, OK? What's your excuse? I was just worried you might get hurt. Take care of yourself, OK? I'll wait up for you. Do you remember your first day, Joe? Were you excited? Yeah, till I got shot. This is your unit. This is a unit? This isn't even a car. Well, what'd you expect, a Seville? This is a classic, even has push button trans. On the radio, you identifyyourselves as crisis one. Community response intosituations involving stress. Who thought that up? The chief. I'm impressed. So was the chief. Good luck. I'll see you out there. The keys are inside. Bye, Joe. Well, we can probably fix it up. It smells in here. Mildew. I'll bet everybodyelse's unit has a heater. What was that? Did you hear that? Yeah, I heard it, but I can't understand. I can never understand this. It sounds like a bad channel. I keep wanting to tune it. I know what, they probablyare trying to get us to know if we're doing all right. I'll try and get them on the radio. Should I ask them to repeat? Mm-hm. Crisis Adam 1. 10-9. 10-9. Crisis 1 Adam, 10-9, please. I don't think you're doing it right. They're not-- They're not answering you. Well, I'm pushing the button. I'm pushing in, and I'mholding it, and I'm talking. That's what he said to do. Crisis 1, 10-3. Let me see, 10-9. Look in the book. Maybe it's, um, dog bite. Wait a minute, 10-- no, no, no. Call your home. No. No, that's a 10-12. Call your office? Out of service? No, that's not right. Is a 10-- Restrict-- OK, wait, wait,restrict radio traffic. Oh. That's 10-- I think that means shut up. Sorry. Sorry. Look, I just want to go home, please. It's nothing you've done. I really just want to be alone. Would you give me my coat? Look, my purse. What are you doing? What's wrong with you tonight?- You've had too much to drink. And I just wanna go home. - Should we do something?- You're hurting me. I don't understand. You're hurting me. And I don't wanna be with you now. Just get in the car, will you? I don't wanna get in the car with you. Crisis 1 Adam, we need a-- Leave me alone. We need a backup unit. Going after her. 10-99. Crisis 1, 10-20, your location. Where are we, damn it? The Alley Cat. Hey, Bill, phone call. Yeah, I'll get it. 999, 927, proceed to the Alley Cat at 1525 Wall Street. He's going after her. Do you think they'll give us a new unit? Don't talk to me about a new unit. In fact, don't talk to me at all. I said I'd see it throughto the end of the month, OK, and I will. It was a fluke the other night. We were almost killed the other night. Will you hand me the bleach? All color or white. The one in the box. Almost getting killed can happen to anybody. It has nothing to do with helping people. We have nothing to do with helping people. A bad start, that's all it was. They're expecting us to show up tonight. Oh, they fixed our unit, huh? Well, it's running. I bet. Elizabeth, do you want tospend the rest of your life doing laundry? - No. In a few years, your kidswill be out of the house, and you'll be bored silly.- Who says I'll be bored? There's a whole world out there. And you can help to make it better. - A whole world? - Yeah. And I can make it better. Yeah. Can I do it after the rinse cycle? OK. Henderson's in there talking with her now. She said she threw the guy out. She said it was somebody she knows. She won't tell us who it is. She's got some bruises on her neck. OK, yeah, good, you're here. OK, this is what's going on. The neighbors called us in. There was a big commotionin this trailer. The lady that lives theresaid an old boyfriend showed up and forced his way through the door. There was a fight, she threw him out. We'll go talk to her. Not so fast. Not so fast. We think there may have been more going on in there than she's telling us. There were some bruises on her neck which matched the MO of theeast side trailer rapist. So what we've got is a woman that may know the name of the guy we're looking for but she's not telling us. Now, Detective Henderson isin there now talking with her. Henderson? Yeah, you know him? We've met. Well, he's not having much luck. I'll bet. Why? Oh, it doesn't matter. OK, so what do we do now? Well, I thought a couplewomen might have a better chance talking to her, you know,loosening her up a bit so maybe she's not tooanxious about the whole thing. So, you know, just calm her down. Win her over so that, you know,she'll talk to us, trust us. OK. Sure, we'll give it a shot. What's her name? Uh, Sophie, Sophie Metzman. Yeah? You. You're the one we saw a few nights ago. What are you talking about? It's you. Outside the Alley Cat. Hey, come on, what is this? More cops. No, we're not cops. Well, yeah, well that I gave at the office. Look, why don't you justlet us come in and sit down and we'll relax and we'll talk. I don't want to talk. I don't want to talk to you. I don't want to talk to him. Good night. - I'm not done. - You are now. Come on, out. Who sent for these? Roy, we weren't getting anywhere. I thought it was worth a try. Yeah? Did you ever think about asking me about it. Look, we think we've seen her before. She was the one in front of the bar, the one who was almost kidnapped. The night our unit got all smashed up. Well, describe the guy. He was big. Well, what else? I can't really say. I don't know. He was trying to kill us. What about the car? Did you get a license plate? What kind of car? Big. Your first night. It was our first night. Yeah. It was our first night. I'll call in our location. What's the code? We're on a 211A. And be sure and give them the address. Crisis 1 Adam, 211A. 1218 East Hartland. Crisis 1, 10-9. Repeat. All units, 211A armed robbery in progress at 1282 East Heartland. Crisis unit may be involved. Bomb I haven't had one of these in years. You know, I love 'em. Isn't this fun? Where were those thingsyou told me with the coconut in them? Armed robbery in progress at 1282 East Hartland. Crisis unit may be involved. Isn't that good? Oh, hey you wanna trade me? Mm-mm. It's better than the vanilla. Just will you get me some sugarless? Would you like one of these? Because I'm getting a lot. I'm getting sugarless. - Sugarless? - Gum. Sugarless gum. It counteracts the candy. What, are you crazy? It does. Kind of brushes your teeth, you know? Don't ever tell my son about this. No, I won't. Something's going on. I wonder what it is. Oh, I know that one. That's a 261. Nope. A 245? Right. Yes. Gimme another one. Um, I don't remember that one. This isn't gonna work. Sure, it's gonna work. It got Francine through sixth grade. Try another one, Sam. Try it a different other one, Sam. I think he came through the side window. This looks pretty similar to that rape case we had the other night. All right, the scene is preserved. It was that side window. What is it you're most afraid of? That he'll come back. I can't stay here. Is there someone you could stay with, like a friend or family? I don't want 'em to know. Well, we'll take you to a shelter then. There'll be other women there. What's gonna happen now? Am I gonna have to answera lot of questions? Well, you have to tell the detective everything that happened. I know it's hard for you to talk about now. It's important for youto realize that everybody here really is on your side. Am I gonna have to go to the hospital? Yeah. Yeah, you have to have a medical examination because the medical statementis part of the evidence. I feel a little dizzy. I'll get some ice cubes. Janice. Janice, I'm Detective Henderson. I know this is a tough time for you, but I've got to ask you some questions. I can't. I can't right now. This won't take long. Please, do I have to do this right now? I can't do it right now. No. No, it's OK. I'm sorry. You'll just have to wait. She was in shock. She just about passed out. She wasn't ready to answer questions. Ready? What does that mean, ready? A day, a week? And who's supposed to decide that, you? We did. And I think you're completely overreacting. No, he's not, Elizabeth. We've had two more rape victims this week. We know that. There's something else going on here. You protected the victim from me. Now what the hell does that mean? We were just trying to make it better for her. It's not gonna be better for her. It happened. It happened. But we can make it better for somebody else by catching the guy. I had men out in the streetwaiting for a description. Henderson, we all care. I want them off the Eastside rape cases. Off. Off. Boy, did you two blow it. At least we're goodentertainment, huh, fellas. We heard you did quite a tapdance in the Chiefs office. Give us a break. Go torture somebody else. Crisis 1 Adam, Drachman and Stone. Over. Crisis 1 Adam, respond to the bus station. 930, male transient. Garbage detail, ladies. Here's your chance to strut your stuff, girls. What kind of crisis is this? A drunk in a bus station? We're victim advocates. Well, think of him as a victim of life. A victim of life? Funny, real funny. I don't need any help. My daughter's gonna pick me up. I know you don't believeme, but we're in Bakersfield. But I took a bus from Modesto. This is Modesto. My daughter lives here. Mr. Katsulas, the clerk told me you've been here for two days. Why don't we find you somewhere to stay tonight and let me try andfind your daughter tomorrow. Come on. We parked right here. You won't have to walk two steps. Oh, that's a nice car. Oh, thank you, Mr. Katsulas. Here we are. OK, all right, I'll go with you. Mom, dad. Hello. Who are you? Zachary Katsulas. Oh, well, that solves everything. Don't panic, Glen. I brought him home. The founders mission was fulland so was the Salvation Army. You bought a derelict home? He's not a derelict,darling, he's an old man. Mom, how could you do this to us? Don't question me, young lady. I just came out for a glass of milk and there's this man sitting there. This is terrific. The next time the jails full,I'll bring the suspect home. It's hardly the same thing. Now, look, I'm gonna go to bed. And when I wake up, thisman will not be here, right? There is nowhere else to put him, Glen. Put him under a bridge. Let him sleep in a freight car. All right? All right. Morning. And that's it. What's so funny, Mr. Katsulas? There are no train stations in Modesto. Nobody called us here. It's a follow up. And besides, there's no officialtie in to the rape case yet. Elizabeth, the police are getting nowhere with this woman. Even Henderson thought the MO was the same. I've been thinking. Oh, terrific. Why would Sophie be so reluctant to cooperate if she was raped? Because of the police, becauseof the questions, the trial. Exactly. She's afraid. And she's alone in this. Come on. We're not supposed to be doing this. Wait a minute. We're supposed to listen for 10 seconds before. Sorry,. Girls are out. Selling cookies? Sophie, we just thoughtwe'd see how you were doing. Well, I'm just fine, thanks. Sophie, please, we can help you. Now, you got to tell us, are you afraid the guy's gonna come back? Has he threatened you? You know, we can help protect you. I mean, are you afraid he's going to get out on bail or something? Yeah, I'm afraid he'll get out on bail. Happens all the time. If you're really afraid,we can relocate you. We can put you in a hotel or a shelter. Look, if you really want to help me, if you're really worried aboutme, then just stay away, OK? Sophie knows something and she's not talking but I don't I understand why. She's scared. She's alone, Elizabeth. Alone? She's got us. Us? Yeah. What are we gonna do? Rotate 24 hour shifts? Hold her hand? Be there for her at 3:00 in the morning when she thinks she hears something outside of her window? But this is a chance for her to do something. Yeah, well. Oh, no. What are we gonna do? Go talk to him. Mr. Katsulas. Hello. It's nice to see you. Mr. Katsulas, what are you doing here? We put you on the bus. I'm looking for my daughter. Oh, your daughter is waitingfor you in Modesto, remember? We spoke to her from the bus station. Back to the drawing board. You know, it's going to be cold tonight. We better find somewhere for you to sleep. All right. I like your house. Oh, no. Oh, no, no. Please, doctor, listen to me. I've done other favors for you, but not bums. Dr. Linden, this is not a bum. He's a nice man, he's just lost. He thinks he's in Wisconsin. Modesto. Find him a bed. Come on, be a pal. A bed? This isn't a hotel. This is a hospital. So find him a gurney. Look, an empty gurney. The problem is solved. His daughter will pick himup at 8:30 tomorrow morning. Honestly. Suicide, the kid's about 24. Looks like he used his 12 gauge. Coroner through yet? I don't think so. Has your brother lived with you long? It was a few months. He didn't have any money. And he couldn't keep his own apartment. I'll get you a glass of water. Um, I wouldn't go in therejust yet, if I were you. The coroner is not quite done. It's a big mistake to blame yourself. He was acting differently. I went out anyway. I don't think youshould stay here tonight. Do you have a friend you could call? No one. There must be someone you could call. Uh, hold it. Is there a back door to this place? Yeah, the service porch. Well, why don't you takethe body out that way? There's no reason she should have this wheeled in front of her. That's a good idea. Yeah. Are you afraid they won't understand? What is it you're afraid they won't understand? Why it happened. Why I didn't do anything to stop it. You know, I think they'regoing to be concerned for you. And I think they're goingto want to try to help you. I do. Are you the one who called us? Yeah. I didn't know exactlywhat to do for this lady. Yeah, well, we'll stay with her. Yeah. There's-- There's, uh-- Blood. Mm-hm. Y'all are new at this, aren't you? Who's gonna clean that up? Not me. Not her. Oh, no way. That's not fair. I'm gonna clean it up. And you're going to help me, understand? You know, Lauren, you were right. There is a place for us. I mean, we were able to do something for her. It's what we've been fighting for. That is exactly what we wanted to do, to help people in crisis. Lauren? What were you doing in the kitchen? You never came back for that glass of water. Isn't that where that guy shot himself? Pull over. Pull over. Lauren? Oh. Lauren. Did you find it? It's gotta be here somewhere. Come on, Lauren, what's happening to you? You're falling apart. Are you sick? Are you having problems at home? No, I just fell alittle behind, that's all. Well, you're not getting the work done. I'm tired of standing on top of you. I want all this work finished off by tonight. I can't stay late tonight. Do you want to keep this job? Yes, Mrs. Larson, I do. We have to do this more often. Thank you. Do you remember the last timewe spent a morning together at home alone? Summer camp. I got another one for you. What? Last lunch alone? Lunch alone. During the week. Lunch alone during the week? I was pregnant with Sam. It was, uh-- it was alittle Italian restaurant. Pizza with anchovies. Anchovies. I miss you. I miss you, babe. Do you think I'm spendingtoo much time away from you and the kids? No, the kids are handling it fine. I miss you the most. It's a big world out there. I've never been part of it. I know, honey. And some of it isn't very pretty, is it? No, but it's the world we live in. And being in it-- being in it makes me appreciateyou and the kids so much. Why don't you wait in the hall? We'll be right out. OK. I don't want him arrested. He's a good man and he didn't mean to do this. What about last time, did he mean it then? And the time before that? Betty, does it really matterif he meant it or not? What we're trying to do here is see what we can do to help you now. I know it sounds ridiculous,but I love my wife. I didn't mean to hurt her. This isn't the first time. I've had a lot of stressat work, a lot of pressure. And then I come home and she's nagging me about some stupid thing. I go nuts and then-- You're just gonna haveto learn to control yourself. I can't leave him. Have you taken a good look at your wife? It's a shelter for women. Yes, I've seen my wife. You can stay a day or two or as long as you need till youcan think clearly, till you can decide what you want. He won't take me back if I leave him tonight. Tonight? Tonight we're just trying to seethat you don't get hurt again. Tell me who called? No, he won't. You see, he's cooled down. I don't know exactly who it was. I don't believe it. I hear him, and he's still angry. Once, once in the last two months. That's the only time anybody's been out here. I don't want to lose him. Just once. I can't make it on my own, I can't. I'm sorry, but it is true. I am not gonna air mydirty laundry to everybody. And it's not your business. I mean, who are you? I told you, I work for theBakersfield Police Department. I am a victim advocate. Who is a victim? Your wife. Hey, we had an argument, it's finished. And now I want you out of here. She's not going to a shelter. She wants to stay. What's the story with the husband? He's still very angry. He wants us out. Then it's time to leave. Joe, we can't leave. That guy is boiling underneath. I don't trust him. Listen, if we can't get her to a shelter, can't we get him out? Can't you arrest him for assault or something? Will she sign a complaint? No, she loves him. There's no kid involved, right? There's no kid, thank god. Well, let's go, ladies. Joe, please, can wejust stay a little longer and try to help these people? I'm not leaving you here. Why not? You just told me the guy'sboiling over with anger. Now let's go. We can't just leave. You've done all you can. They want us out, we're gonnawish 'em well, say goodbye. Now, let's go. Hello? I didn't tell anyone. No. I swear. I didn't say anything. Please, leave me alone. This is good. I bet they were even betteryesterday when they were fresh. You had to say it. Do I have any Jimmies in my teeth? There's one right-- right there. You know, I think you're alittle neurotic about that. Well, I-- I forget. It's-- What? It's embarrassing. Come on, what? It's 2:30 in the morning. There's no one in here. You can tell me. OK, when I first went outwith Andy, my very first date, I was so nervous. And it took me hours to dress. And we-- we doubled with some friends. And I had a really good time. I got along with everybody. I talked and I laughed. And-- So yeah, yeah. When we I got home and I looked in the mirror. And I-- I smiled at myself. And right here. Uh-uh. No, was a huge, brown grain of wild rice. Nobody-- And nobody told me. Nobody told you? Yes. Those were enemies. Those weren't friends. I've got a lot of Andy stories. Some of them-- some of them aren't so funny. The breakup still hurts, huh? Well, you know, when you have a kid, you're never really divorced. It's-- it's not a clean break. I wish I could carry theball by myself, I really do. But I can't. You ever wish that you can go back in time, start all over again. Hm-hm, no. I wouldn't do anythingdifferently, because then I wouldn't have Josh. Evening, ladies. - Hi. - Hi. You girls want anything? Uh-huh. Hey, you know that 245we were on the other night? Mm-hm. The woman pulled through. I'm glad. I'm really glad. You know, she has three kids at home. There aren't any left with jimmies. What? There are no what? Jimmies, they don't have enough jimmies. Aw, shucks, is there no jimmies. Oh, well, you want one of mine. We've got some jimmies, pink ones. Are you sleeping better? Oh, a few hours in the morningwhen it starts to get light. Are you afraid it'll happen again? Yeah. I don't blame you. Most women are afraid of that. But I'll tell you something,it's highly unlikely. You know, you did a verygood thing for yourself, moving to a second story apartment. I feel like-- like this whole thing has-- has wrecked my life. I know you feel like thatnow, but it's very important to get that feeling behind you. Have you told your boyfriend yet? No. I'm afraid he'll blame me. Janice, this is not your fault. I left the window open. And-- and I didn't fight hard enough. I should have fought harder. Janice, you're alive, you're here, do you know what that means? You are here. Janice. Janice, there is nothing to be ashamed of. I wish I could go back to work. You know, that's a good idea. Yeah, but I work late. And I'd-- and I'd haveto come home in the dark. Well, talk to your bossabout changing your hours. Will you talk to him for me? Janice, you could do that for yourself. But I'll be there if you need me. Did you remember to bring the antacids? Mm-hm, they're in my purse. You know, Joe was right. These are the best tacos. You got a little taco sauce right on your-- Yeah, right-- yeah, right there. It's Sophie. Fresno. No thanks, I've already eaten. Going somewhere, Sophie? No, I'm taking toBakersfield by.. Sophie. Look, I gotta go. It's my business. Sophie, will you just give us a minute. Sophie, please. You know, you've been a royal pain. Sophie, you know what your trouble is, you don't know who's on your side. There's a mad man out there who'd really get off on killing me. I don't care whose side you're on. Sophie, a woman was hurt the other night. What if it's the same guy who attacked you? If you identify him and help get him convicted, just think of all thewomen who won't have to go through what you went through. Who are you kidding? I'm a cocktail waitress. I work in a bar. I picked the guy up there. I even went out with him a couple of times. Nobody's gonna call what I went through a rape. You hear me? Sophie, just talk to thepolice Tell 'em what you know. And then you could go to Fresnoor wherever it is you're going. Sophie, you can help. We need you, damn it. There's nothing to eat in this house anymore. When was the last time mom went shopping? When was the last time you went shopping? Me? You. Why should I have to go shopping? Do you want to eat? Stay off to the side of the living room window. Our marksmen have a target. Take your radio, put it on frequency four, and keep it open. We'll clear the channel for you. What's her name? Elvira Newton. Now, we know she has a gun on her husband. And there's a 9-year-old kid in the house. She wants to talk to us. That's what she said. You can still back out of this. In front of a SWAT team? Great, macho mothers. Allunits, clear frequency 4. Crisis unit involved in A115. Suspect armed and considered dangerous. Repeat, all units clear frequency four. Dad! Dad! Guess what mom's doing? I thought you were supposedto be doing your homework. I am. Do you want to know what mom's doing? What is mother doing? She's freeing a hostage. We're working on it. I wantthe neighbors cleared out of the houses on both sides. 10-4. Mrs. Newton. I'm gonna kill him, I'm really gonna kill him. Oh, Mrs. Newton, that won't solve anything. It'll only make matters worse. Mrs. Newton, why don't yousend your little girl out here. You don't want her to see herparents mad at each other, do you? You have kids? I do, a 15-year-old and a 12-year-old. You telling me you neverfight in front of your kids? We fight, Mrs. Newton, Ialways feel so bad afterward. What about you? You got kids? You married? Uh, a six-year-old boy, but I'm divorced. Tell me about it. Mrs. Newton, why don't you put your gun down? We could talk. It's, uh, it's kind oflike your story, Mrs. Newton. You know, we both-- we got married when we were really young. And we were both only 19. And he had trouble handling it, you know. One day he's a kid, and thenext day he's a family man. Did he ever mess around? Yes, Mrs. Newton, he messed around. But looking back on it now, Iwish we would have talked more, you know, work things out. We just didn't know how. You want to talk? Hell, yes, I'll talk. You happily married? Yes, I am. What's so good about your husband? He's very good with kids and-- and he's good with me. Oh, come on. Well, he's-- he's sensitive and-- Come on, dad, let me in. Youcould say he's thoughtful. I wanna hear too. Sam, in a minute. He's gentle. You could say he's a very gentle man. In a minute, Sam. In bed? Come on, let me in. I gotta do my homework. Yes, Mrs. Newton, in bed. Hi. Long night, huh? Guess what we did? We talked a lady into freeing her little girl. We talked her into putting down her gun. - I know. - And then we-- I know. I know. I know. Everybody knows everything. Oh, honey, they made uskeep the radio channels open. Listen, I was very complimentary. Please, I have been up all night worried sick. This whole thing has gotten out of hand. I don't know how you could let them put you in alife-threatening situation. She wouldn't talk to anyone else. The SWAT team finally let us do it. Honey, I want you to quit. No way, will I quit. Freeing hostages is not part of the game plan. Now, you're supposed to be an advocate, not a negotiator for the SWAT team. We're still trying tofigure out what the job is. This is what your job is and you are finished. I went through hell tonight. I can't go through it again. I'm not going to quit because you're nervous. I can't go through thisevery time you go on shift. Do you know what I've gonethrough for 15 years every time you have gone on shift? Honey, what you go through is different. Different? Different, why is it different? Just because tonight youhad the pit in your stomach. Oh no, Liz, I go on shift inorder to bring home a paycheck. I do not go out there for kicks. Kicks? You think I'm doing this for kicks? I'm doing this for me because it makes me feel good about myself. Tonight I feel like we saved a life. Do you know how that feels? You do know how that feels. I'm tired. I'm going to bed. I have to drive car pool tomorrow. I've been trying toreach you for three nights. Andy, my job is already on the line. If you want to fight aboutsomething, let's do it later. Now. You've been sticking it tome about being irresponsible. And practically every day and every night you've been leaving our kid alone. That's not true. I called you three nights straight. It was an unusual week. The police have been spread very thin because of the Eastside rape case. And I had to work an extra night. Look, I don't want to hearabout your volunteer stuff. Your first priority should be Josh. If you can't take care of him, I will. I don't believe you'd do that. Don't try me. He should have a parent, not a babysitter. You're not here about Josh. You're just here to hurt me. You're gonna have to makesome decisions, Lauren. I think my kid is being neglected. This is great. I needed it. It's so quiet. I got docked this week. What? Mz. Larson took out $20 from my paycheck. Why? Remember when Joecalled in early last week? Yeah. 20 bucks just like that. So I complained to Larson,and she put me on probation. I don't believe it. I thought you were their best typist. A living legend. Listen, do you need any money? I can help you? Nah. At least now I know if I get into trouble, I have contacts at the food bank. Andy's putting methrough the meat grinder. He wants me to quit andspend more time with Josh. You know the DOA run the other night? Yeah. I stepped over the body. I just stepped over it. Do you think less of me for that? I mean, would you havestepped over someone's body? Let me ask you something. Did you try to walk around it? Kind of. Well, it's OK. It is. Has Janice gone back to work yet? Nope. That's great. That's just great. We had a big effect. Are you feeling a little down today? You betcha. I volunteer for the sake of my community, and I'm going down the toilet. Who's gonna volunteer to help me? What, so you're just gonna quit? You're not gonna finish something you started? There's no finish to this. There is no end. You're just gonna quit? You're gonna quit theway Wilson said we would? Elizabeth, I've got myselfand my kid to worry about. And I'm falling apart at the seams. OK. We won't take any more new cases, but we're gonna finish the ones we have. Hi. It's been a long shift. Did you have a chance to call the kids? Yeah. I'll take them out when I get home. I wonder what movie we'llsee again this time. You know I was thinking,we both have Sunday off. Why don't we do something special? 931, Sophie Metzman. Mm-hm, he'll love it. 8970 Arroyo Way. Crisis 1 Adam, 10-4. Adviseif you need assistance. Negative. We've got a 931 at 8970 Arroyo Way. We said no new cases. It's not new, it's Sophie. She's here. She's back? Looks that way. They asked me if we needed a police back up and I said I didn't think we needed one. I kept thinking about how I'dfeel if somebody else got hurt, you know, some other lady. Maybe I could have done something about it. It took a lot of courageto come back, Sophie. You better believe it. And you'd better cover my butt, you know? I'll tell you what's gonna happen, they're gonna pick this guyup, they're gonna let him out on bail, and then I've had it. You mark my words. Listen, if he gets out on bail, you're gonna know throughus, I promise you. Oh, big deal. Come on, have some faithin the system, just a little. I'll talk to you guys. Sophie, it's a better ideaif you don't talk to us. You have to talk to the police. We'll take you down to the station house. Wait a minute, you mean,you guys really aren't cops. No, we're not cops. Are you serious? No guns, no badge. We're volunteers. You mean, I've been done in by volunteers, a couple of women whodon't even rate a salary. Thanks, Sophie, we never thought of it that way. You really made our day, Soph. Come on, let's go talk to the detective. I have to get the evidence. You have evidence? Well, of course, I have evidence. What is it? I thought I was only supposedto show it to a real cop. You're right. Let's go. No, it's a bar tab. I waited on him the night I met him, it was a vodka Martini with a twist. I know, normally, a bar tabwould be worthless, right? Right. Well, he paid with a credit card. The bank would have a record, wouldn't they? Yeah, it's like having his address. Why would they give a guylike that a credit card? Elizabeth, he didn't writerapist on his application. - Can we go, now? - I'll get my coat. Thank you. I didn't say anything. They're not cops. Crisis 1 Adam-- Drop it. Welfare check. Don't hurt her. Shut up. They're not cops, huh? Crisis1 Adam, welfare check. What do they want? They just want to know if we're OK. Can I tell them we're OK? No codes. Hi, Gloria, this is Crisis1 Adam, we're fine, thanks. Crisis1, 10-9, are you code 4? Sure. Really, we're just fine. Everything is-- is copacetic. See, that was easy. No one's worried about us now. You can just leave. You're gonna get me in trouble. I know. I know you will. - Hey, listen. Why don't you just-- Ah! The window. The windows don't open. You know, I don't want to alarm you guys, but there's no way out of here. Now, let's count our blessings. At least he can't climb in, which is not to say we don't have our problems. Oh, I wish you guys were cops. You know what, Sophie,there's no satisfying you. Ah! I don't like this. I don't see anything. He's trying to burn the place down. I can smell it. Oh, God. He's gonna sit out thereuntil we burn to death. We gotta get out of here. Now, all right, I'm gonna open the door. And if he's there, I'm gonna fend him off. Sophie, you run. Elizabeth, do you remember anyof those holds they taught us? I don't know. All right. Come on, come on, come on.Get out. Move it. Put him in the car. I'll be right along. How you doing? Woozy. They found him hiding under somebody's porch. Yeah. Good job. Do you want to stop by Johnin the office, say goodbye? I'm staying as faraway from there as I can. You know, it fries me that he was right. I quit on him. John, we were just coming up to see you. Yeah, like hell. You know, you guys, you really ticked me off. Sorry, John. No, it was my fault. Ineeded more time for my kid. And I have to keep my job. You got a job here. One with a salary, John. Sorry to be picky. I got a grant. A what? You're on salary. How much? All right, I'll give you an office, too. Is he kidding? Is he kidding? I want a big office. I want a view with curtains in it. Curtains? You think we can get a candy machine. - Oh, look at that window.- That's a great view. Look at that. Let's try it. Let's ask him if we can have one of these. I don't want a small. I want-- I want peach, too. You know, my ankles are beginning to itch. Fleas. We'll get it sprayed. It won't be so bad once we get it painted. Maybe I should just keeppicking until I find a window. Well, this is your office, huh? Uh-huh. Congratulations, ladies. You did a good job. Thanks, Roy. Thanks for coming by. Yeah. Maybe we'll go get a beer,talk things over, huh, Roy? Beer, huh? That sounds good. What do you say-- how about tonight? Meet you at The Alley Cat? Cute, Roy. See you. Bye. Elizabeth. Uh-huh? What? Janice, you look great. Janice, hi. I was looking for you. Yeah? Is everything all right? Yeah, that's why I wanted to see you. I wanted you to know that I'm OK. And I've gone back to work. Good for you. Great. Well, I couldn't have done it without you. Thanks. Listen, are you looking for a volunteer? That's a-- that's a verygood idea, as a matter of fact.
