I hate the army. I'm not ready. You'll be ready once you get enlisted. "Not ready" will turn into "ready." This is a constitutional requirement. Who's that guy on Facebook? I'm in BMT. The hardest part of my life. And you choose to leave me now? Hey, where's your muzzle? Shit! Did you see my muzzle? I think Sergeant Heng took it. Bloody hell, Recruit Ken! -You will stay back this weekend. -Sergeant, I can't, please! My girlfriend is going overseas. -I need to send her off. -Get out of my office! -Sir, please listen. -Out! I'm going to Changi Airport to send her off. She'll be so touched when she sees me. Tears will flow down her face. I know. Drink more water. I don't want any of you to get heat injury. He's in a serious condition, severely dehydrated. I kept calling him, but he's not responding. My dad's accident was because of my own selfish mistake. Yes, I made a mistake. But luckily, it's never too late. Ken! -Morning. -Ken, is that you? What on earth are you doing here? Ken, you used to wake up late. Why are you up so early today? Ken, you forgot to shit. I shitted already. See you! You shit so early? Shit! I can't lose. Faster! Hi, Aloysius. Buddy, you're early for fall in. It's shocking! This is like a slap to Wayang King's face. He can't show off now. -Hello! -Don't say that. I bet the commanders' jaws will drop if they find out. Excuse me, buddy. I forgot to tell you that I had a stomachache earlier. So I took longer than usual today. So sorry. As your buddy, I should know that you had a stomachache. -I feel so guilty now. -Enough. Hey, buddy. He's already a handful. With you in the picture, the whole platoon will go crazy. Take it easy. Put on an act only when you have to. -Steady, okay? -Steady, okay? We should all be serious then. Steady, okay? I'm giving you ten seconds. Go put your bags in front. Move! Ten, nine, eight, seven... Raise your leg higher. Raise your leg. Good. Relax. That's enough. It's been an hour. Let's rest and continue tomorrow. Yes, right. My brain is not working. Where are you going? Hey. Slowly. The doctor told me that your condition is not serious. You'll get well. Just take it slowly, okay? Okay, my brain is not working. How I wish I'm the one whose brain is not working. Then, you can take care of me. Okay, sorry! Forget I said that. Everyone is fine. We are all healthy and our brains are all working. Honestly, we really shouldn't joke about our brains. Slowly. He was just like this when he first learned to walk. Left, left, left, right! Stop! Right turn, face the front. Face the back, turn. Face the front, turn. Left, left, left, right. Eyes left. Ready, turn. Eyes front. Ready, turn. - Left, right. - Ready, turn. Left, right. Eyes right. Turn. Left, right. Eyes front. Ready for left turn. Turn. Sergeant. Quick forward march. Left, left, left, right, left. Look at the girls platoon! Left, right. Nice! What a beautiful sight. Pretty girls! Come on, give us an "eyes right." Come on, hurry! -Eyes right. -Nice. Right! So beautiful! Eyes front! Ready! Keep up! To the rear, march! Left, left, left, right. Left, left, left, right, left. To the rear, march! Left, right, left. -Down. -One. -Down. -Two. -Down. -Three. -Down. -Four. -Down. -Five, six. -Down. -Seven. -Down. -Eight. -Down. -Nine. -Down. -Ten. -Down. -Eleven. -Down. -Twelve. -Down. -Thirteen. -Down. -Fourteen. -Down. -Fifteen. -Down. -Sixteen. -Down. -Seventeen. Listen up, gentlemen. Before we throw the SFG live grenades today, you'll practice on your SPG practice grenades. Be confident, don't panic, and aim at your target. Prepare grenade! Safety pin twist, safety pin pull, safety pin out. Grenade is ready to be thrown, Sergeant! -Throw grenade. -Grenade! One thousand, two thousand, three thousand, four thousands, five thousands! Exploded! Detail 1, move to your respective bays! I S93063328. Recruit Muthu Shanmugaratnam. -Right master hand. -Non-sweaty palm. Request permission to enter the bay, Sergeant! Enter. IP Man, are you ready? Yes, Sergeant! -Prepare grenade! -Prepare grenade! -Grenade prepared, Sergeant. -Ready! Safety pin twist, safety pin pull, safety pin out. -Here, Sergeant. -That's a grenade! Grenade! Hold it. Hold it tight. Don't let go. Now, come up slowly. You know what to do, right? -Yes, Sergeant. -Okay. -Throw grenade. -Grenade! The grenade has exploded. One thousand and one. Recover. Yes, Sergeant. Stand up and point your rifle! See me after this, understand? Yes, Sergeant. Platoon 2 is ready for area inspection, Sergeant Major. This is my territory! It is your duty to keep this place clean and tidy, is that clear? -Yes, Sergeant Major! -Yes, Sergeant Major! I can't hear you! -Yes, Sergeant Major! -Yes, Sergeant Major! Recruit, why are you so smelly? You smell like a rubbish dump. How often do you wash your uniform? Once a week, Sergeant Major. Once a week? Sergeant Ong! -Yes, sir. -Smell your man! -Do you know how dirty your man is? -Yes, sir. Not only must we keep our area clean, we must also keep ourselves clean and hygienic! So that we don't fall sick so easily. Is that clear? -Yes, Sergeant Major! -Yes, Sergeant Major! Carry on! You really smell like shit. How often do you wash your uniform? My mom does my laundry, Platoon Sergeant. Are you in NS or your mom? I am, Platoon Sergeant. You bloody lazy bum. I want you to drop 20. Every single time you go down, I want to hear you say, "I'm in NS, not my mom." Understand? Yes, Platoon Sergeant. Carry on. Ninja! I'm in NS, not my mom, sir. I'm in NS, not my mom... I can't believe you're making me do your mom's job! Because all of you smell bad, you made me look bad in front of the Sergeant Major! What do you think you should do? Twenty push-ups, Platoon Sergeant. Only 20? How to train your arms? One hundred push-ups, Platoon Sergeant. There, all of you heard that. Your dear section mate said it, not me. I can only give you 20 push-ups. You're good, I like it. -Thank you, Platoon Sergeant. -Carry on, you lot! -Ninja! -Ninja! One, Platoon Sergeant. Two, Platoon Sergeant. Recruit Jin. -Yes, Sergeant! -Eight minutes and forty-two seconds. Best in the platoon. Not only that, the best in the company. All give him a round of applause. Thank you, Sergeant. Ken. Yes, Platoon Sergeant. Your timing has also improved a lot. I realize you haven't been reporting sick. That's very good. Can you share with the platoon your secret for running? Gentlemen. He meant Recruit Ken. You come back. Never mind. You can share your secret. Thank you, Platoon Sergeant. Gentlemen, my secret is no secret. My secret is no cigarettes. According to a US medical report, smoking affects your stamina. Nice! All the smokers, did you hear that? His secret is "no cigarettes." Platoon Sergeant, we can't run fast not because-- Okay, don't give me any more excuses until you show me that you can run. Since you can't help yourself, let me help you. From today onward, all smokers, instead of three sticks, you'll only get one, understand? -Good grief! -No way! No complaints. Look at your times. Mostly, not satisfactory. Remember, smoking is just a privilege, not an entitlement. I want to commend Recruit Jin for sharing his secret with us. "No cigarettes." Thank you, sir. Well done. Platoon IC, carry on. Platoon, stand at attention! Right Dress! Eyes to the front! What rubbish was that? We don't care if you want to perform wayang. Because of you, we only get one cigarette a day. How are you going to compensate us? I shared simple medical knowledge with you guys because you are my section mates and I love all of you. I just hope you pass your 2.4km run and be the best section, that's all. Damn you and your bullshit! Whether we pass our IPPT or not is none of your business. So don't be a nosy parker. You're really full of shit! Lobang, please don't use your vulgarism on me. I didn't do anything wrong! What do you want me to say? I really don't know anything. You don't know what happened? Everybody knows how you are. You suck up to all the commanders so that you can go to OCS. Please! It's not like that, Ismail. There's no point fighting with this kind of people. We will get charged. Let them be. Relax, guys. One day, you'll know I meant well. According to army history, this kind of person exists in every platoon. Too bad he's in our section. Guys, listen to me. Why don't we just give it a shot? Stop smoking for one week. Let's see what happens. Maybe he's right. Hey! We are smokers. How can we not be united? And you... We won't be so easily defeated by you. Using black tape will be harder to detect. Hey, it works. Well done. That's smart. The smoke is going out that way. Will the Sergeant see it? No way, we are on the third floor. They won't have time for us. Don't worry. Guys, can this be our last cigarette? -Why? -After today's 2.4km run, I feel like my stamina sucks, you know. I think it's because of smoking. So you agree with Wayang King? Blaming cigarettes? Please! Hello, I'm a smoker too, but I came in fifth in today's run. I was fourth. Ken. Unukku neechal theriyilehna, neenthateh. Neechal udai perusa irukuthu nu sollatheh. -What? -What did he say? It means if you can't swim, just say you can't swim, Ken. Don't blame the swimming trunks for being too big. It's amazing even the Tamil people have the same saying, just like us, Hokkiens. Hey guys, I really feel that Wayang has a point. Why don't we just stop smoking for one week? Buddy, I think we're on different frequencies here. We are all smokers. How can you say such things that lack unity? Hey, I'm just hoping everyone does well for the physical test. How is that considered lacking in unity? If you stop smoking, our stamina will improve. Our physical test results will be better. We can all be the best recruits together. "Best recruits"? Buddy, this is my first time hearing you talk like this. If you aim to be the best recruit, then we should go our separate ways. I'll never give the army my best. The best recruit helps the army to help himself. While the best brother does the best for his brothers. There's no conflict between the best recruit and the best brother. Who says there's no conflict? You're telling us to quit smoking. I ask you guys to quit smoking. Is it for my sake? It's for everyone's good. Clearly, we are on different sides now. Let's go. Now I realize, in the army, only an idiot would tell his friends to become a good soldier. -Have you ever wondered? -Have you ever wondered? -Why must we serve? -Why must we serve? -Because we love our land -Because we love our land -And we want it to be free, to be free -And we want it to be free, to be free Ninja Company, everything off! -Everything off! -Everything off! Recruit Ken, come with me. Yes, Sergeant. I think you need a massage. No, thank you. Hey. Hey, Ming. I have a question. I heard there wasn't any night training in Pulau Tekong before. Why is that? Don't you know? Because of dirty things. "Dirty things"? Just clean the area. No, things that you cannot see. Like this. Hey. Twenty years ago, a bunch of recruits went on a route march on a Thursday night. When they returned to the company line, they realized one of the soldiers was missing. They were so worried that they activated the whole battalion to look for him. Guess where they found him? Where? Inside the jungle under a tree. His body was found beside the tree with his intestines placed nicely next to his body. Standby organs. Goodness. I think I've heard of this story before. It's called Charlie Company! -Yes. -Yes. Haven't you heard about this? No. Come on, this is 2013. Obviously, these rumors are for entertainment only. There are no ghosts in this world. Besides, we are 3G soldiers. We shouldn't be superstitious. What religion are you? Well, I'm a freethinker. I don't believe in anything except myself. Let me repeat myself. There are no ghosts in this world. -Left, right. -Ninja! -Left, right. -Warriors! -Left, right. -Roar away! -Training to be soldiers -Training to be soldiers Fight for our land Platoon 2, ready to send arms? -Ready! -Ready! -Send arms! -Send arms! One-seven-one, one-seven-two. One-seven-two, one-seven-three. One-seven-three, one-seven-four. -One-seven-four, one-seven-five! -One-seven-five, one-seven-six! I have blisters. The 8km is already so tough. How will I survive 24km? Time for a shower. How can you guys do this to me? Who put a stone in my bag? Who? Who did it? Who sabotaged me? No wonder my field pack was so heavy. Lobang, I know it's you! - Hey. - Hey. You may be full of shit, but don't throw it at me. Do you have evidence? I know it's you! Because of the smoking issue! Lobang is our leader. Why would he do this? -So it's you? -Hey! I'm too skinny to put a stone in your field pack. So who? Don't be a coward. You've got the balls to do it, but you don't have the balls to admit it! You guys are not men! Is it you? -You? -Not me! Damn, nobody is claiming responsibility. Maybe it's someone from another section. Don't you know that the whole platoon doesn't like you? Because of your nonsense, not only does our section get affected, so do other sections. You're really something. No one wants to admit it? -Fine, I'll go tell Sergeant! -Hey! Aloysius, listen carefully. If you tell the Platoon Sergeant, he'll know someone pulled a trick on you. Why? Because nobody likes you. And you're stupid enough to tell him. Now that he knows, you'll never make it to OCS. The stone is so big. How did you not realize it was in your bag? Now, you're going to complain? What a joke. We're doing you a favor right now. Wayang. If you can't even take care of your field pack, how are you going to take care of your platoon? Hey. It's okay if you want to go tell the Platoon Sergeant. Go ahead, since we didn't put the stone in your bag. -Right, guys? -Yes. -Go on, report it. -Go on. Let's shower. You mean they put a stone in your field pack? How could they do that? Dear, you better call the minister and tell him that our son was bullied in the camp. You have to fight back. You must be strong if you want to be an officer. Otherwise, the officer won't let you be an officer. So an eye for an eye it is. Dear, teach our son how to fight back! The best way to fight back is not to do anything. What? Dear, what do you mean don't do anything? Let me tell you a story. Country A and Country B are at war. Country A has very strong artillery that can easily destroy Country B. You got that? Let me explain it to you. Imagine this is Country A's artillery base. Country B has no choice, but to call for an air strike. Country A actually has another firing base. So Country B lost? Not yet. Country B's commander is very pissed. He immediately activates their tanks to destroy this firebase. -See? -Nice! Here's one company. And another company. -Nice! -They attack from here. A two-directional attack. Country A's firing base will be destroyed! Don't forget. Country A also has its air force. Country B lost again? Not yet. You see that? The Navy. Battleships! This time the firing base will be destroyed for sure. Yes, fire at will. But this is not the end yet. Country A has submarines. Nice! A submarine! Dad, if I'm the commander, I won't let this happen. I'll use sea mines to attack the submarine before they attack me. Right, Dad? I'm not here to discuss with you what weapons are being used. I want you to tell me what have you learned from this story? It's like going back and forth. You attack me and I attack you. Right. So, they put one stone in your field pack and you put two stones back into their field packs. Three, four, five stones. There's no end to it, right? Yes. So what should you do? Mom, I understand it now. Dad is right. Don't do anything. Just focus on my training. What did you tell him, dear? Nothing. I just brought him around and introduced the signature dishes. See, there are prawn noodles, roast meat, BBQ chicken wings. -Right? -Yes. Dear, I forgot to order. Your dad doesn't want anyone to help him. He said as long as he keeps practicing, he'll be able to do it himself. That's how tee ki he is. What's that? "Iron teeth." I mean, he's stubborn. Dad. No, let him be. He can handle it. He doesn't like people to help him. Let him do it. My dad became partially paralyzed after suffering from a stroke. But his strong willpower and determination made me even more ashamed of myself. -Dad. -Dad. Ken is behaving better now. The army has really changed him. Army? It's thanks to me, his mom! Didn't you see me disciplining him over the years? Did you? He got worse with your method. These two should be sent to the army too. Dad, drink a bit. Your dad can't open and close his mouth properly. He can't drink. Take it away, go. Your son received his first paycheck of 480 dollars. He wanted to get you a present. Guess what he bought? This wheelchair. I told him it's not worth it! Because you won't need it for long. It will be thrown away soon, right? -Yes. -Yes. I asked him why Grandma and I don't get presents. Guess what he said? "Mom, I'll buy you one next month because I already overspent." -We also don't get any presents. -We also don't get any presents. Dad, come try it. Yes, try it. Hold here. IP Man, are you okay? I'm okay. You look so tired. Must be your girlfriend. How many times? Please don't talk about my girlfriend. Another mutiny. Room! -Good evening, Sergeant! -Good evening, Sergeant! Good evening, sir! Hey, it's an old trick. It's Sunday night. All the commanders are idling away. They aren't so free to come on a Sunday night. They won't come back! Your acting is so good. You think by standing still, I'll believe they're standing behind me? Stupid Sergeant Ong! Stupid Sergeant Heng! Stupid! For your sake, I'll turn and take a look. Good evening, sir! Nice. Sergeant Ong. Sergeant Heng. Your recruit just called you stupid. Hey, Ismail. Have a seat. Have a seat, I said. Coffee. So last night in front of the OC, you called Sergeant Ong stupid thrice. May I know which part of me made you think I'm stupid? Sergeant Ong, I... I'm sorry, Sergeant Ong. I was just kidding. I didn't mean it, Sergeant Ong. Don't take it to heart, Sergeant Ong. You're not stupid, Sergeant Ong. I'm stupid. So, you're stupid, not me. Yes, sir, you're stupid. -What? -No, I mean, we're stupid, sir. -"We"? -No! No, I'm stupid, sir. Only one person. Just me. -Never mind. -Sorry, Sergeant Ong. -Drink coffee. -I'm stupid. Sorry, Sergeant Ong. Don't be angry. It's simple English. Don't you understand? I said, drink the coffee. Don't worry, there's no poison in it. Who said you could finish it? Ismail, what happened? What did Platoon Sergeant say? It was strange. Instead of punishing me, he gave me... -coffee. -Coffin? Coffee! Coffee. After I finished the coffee, he asked why I finished it. I'm confused. I'm scared. -It's okay. -You're being marked. What's that? Being marked is a kind of punishment. But on the record, it's not a punishment. Actually, it is a punishment. But they say it's not a punishment. Everybody knows it's a punishment. You know it's a punishment too, but you can't do anything about it. You can't complain to MINDEF. You can't complain to a minister. You can't complain to an MP. You also can't complain to your mom. So being marked is the worst punishment in the army. I still don't get it. Gentlemen, our Company CQ needs help cleaning stores. I need one volunteer. Okay, Ismail. You are the volunteer. Very good. I like it, thank you. Yes, Platoon Sergeant. So polite. He even said, "Thank you". Now I know what being marked means. Hey, guys. One day we may all be sergeants and officers. Remember, we shouldn't do these things to our men. The best recruit has spoken. As you know, the person marked will have a hard time. What's worse is that you guys aren't even sergeants and officers, but you're marking others. Who did we mark? You? Hey, it's not about me, okay? We don't just mark some people. If we could kill him, we would. Ken! Later when I go out, I'll hopefully get struck by the GPMG and hospitalized. Let's see if she still cares about me. Are you okay, IP Man? If not, I'll help you tell Sergeant Heng. I'm just kidding. Not funny, IP Man. Ready, move! Gentlemen, I need all of you to be clear about this. I'm the conducting officer for your Battle Inoculation Course. The purpose of this training is to simulate wartime situations. Whatever you learned during your BMT will be used in this training. Hey, IP Man! Come! -No! -Come on! No! IP Man! Okay. Go in on the count of three. -One, two... -No. Come on! My goodness. Hey, IP Man! Come on! Goodness! No. No, stop it! No. Ken, where's your buddy? He's behind. Behind? So you just left him? I asked him to move, but he's just cowering there, Sergeant. Always remember, as a soldier, you leave no man behind, understand? -Yes, Sergeant! -What did I say? "Leave no man behind!" Go! Recruit IP Man, standby! I'm so tired! If I sleep now, I won't be able to wake up. Why aren't you answering my calls? IP Man, are you okay? Damn it. She's not answering my calls. Use this to call. She won't answer if she sees your number. -Okay? -Anything? Buddy, I'll get my mom to go and talk to your girlfriend. -Your mom can help? -Sure, she's very free. Don't do it. If it works, he'll claim credit for life. Maybe he will even go to the press. Hello, I'm not that kind of person, okay? I've got a good idea. Why don't the whole section call her like the GPMG? She'll pick up sooner or later. I'll call first. No. How can the best recruit do these kinds of things with us? Never mind, let us do it. Smokers, come. Never mind, we'll do it. -What's the number? -You first. Hey, that's enough! What do you want? -Hello? -Who are you? Where's my girlfriend? I see, so you're her ex-boyfriend whose mouth is bigger than his head? Mayoki told me to tell you she has broken up with you. Don't call her anymore, okay? Stop calling? Who the hell are you? Why are you using my girlfriend's phone? Me? I'm the handsome and cool guy who can protect her. My nickname is Real Bullet. Shut up, loudmouth! -I want to speak with her! -She's not free to talk. We're in the middle of doing it. You... Damn it, you stole my girl! Where the hell are you? I'm going to kill you! Aren't you in Pulau Tekong? Come if you've got the guts. I'll fight you till the end! Damn, he hung up on me! Goodness, I feel so bad. Why? It's the only way to get a clean break. You guys handle him. I'll go get Sergeant. Why would you get Sergeant over such a trivial matter? How will you be an officer? Excuse me, please respect your section IC. -It's my duty. -Section IC? Why don't you go eat shit and pretend nothing happened? Wash your hands off the matter. Go eat shit while it's still warm. Okay, I'm fine. Firers adopt foxhole unsupported positions. Firers magazine of four rounds. Load! -Magazine of four rounds. Load! -Magazine of four rounds. Load! -Ready. -Ready! Test it out. Firers engaging figure 11 target. Watch your front. -Watch your front! -Watch your front! IP Man, that was not bad. You got 12 out of 12. You're a marksman. Couldn't tell you're such a marksman. Because I imagined that bastard was my target. I really want to kill him. My girlfriend was stolen. Ready of four rounds. Load! Remember when my girlfriend left me? You encouraged and comforted me. You told me everything's going to be okay. I always tell you to look at the bright side of life. I thought it was easy. But now that it happened to me... Damn, it's really painful. After a while, everything will be okay. Trust me. You're not hurting anymore? No, I'm not. Maybe you didn't love her that much. That's why the pain was easy to get rid of. But I'm different! Now that she has left me, I realized that I love her a lot. I even wanted to give her my virginity. My virginity, you know? Calm down, IP Man. Let me tell you what my dad taught me. Girlfriends are actually like our rifles. Possess her when the chance arises. She lets you zero in. You get to do whatever you want with her. She lets you take her apart and put her back together again. Once you get the hang of her, you can bring her to the range. It would be like heaven during the live firing. Hey, Lobang! -Sorry, Sergeant! -You don't like me, right? -No, Sergeant. -I said don't point your rifle at people. -Sorry, Sergeant. -See me after this. Yes, Sergeant. After firing, problems arise. You need to take care of her, pamper her. After a while, things will be stale. Do you think only you need excitement? Your girlfriend gets bored too. Think about it. We're in Tekong and she's out there. Those who have completed their service will come and steal our girls. -You know why? -Why? Because their girlfriends were also stolen during their basic training. So now they come steal ours. Once we complete our service, we'll steal other recruits' girlfriends. That's the never-ending cycle. Once we complete our training, we'll pass out. Just take it as your girlfriend got posted out. It's normal. But don't forget. You're still young. You'll meet many other rifles in the future. So why kill yourself over this? But she didn't get posted out. She is finished with me. Finished? So what? Maybe one day she'll come back and give you a reservist. Excuse me, please respect your rifle. Hey! Why don't you go shower instead of using dry powder? Save water, you know? Lobang, do you have any more batteries? No way. You're not calling that bitch anymore. I don't believe she doesn't love me anymore. There's no way she could leave me like this. I know she still loves me. Hey, are you deaf or mental? She left you for that bastard. What do you want? I want to know how that bastard looks. I want to let the whole world know that the bastard stole my girlfriend! Because of him, I feel so painful. Okay, I'll help you. An iPad! Don't make a big fuss. It's the same one that he has. But this one has a camera. Excuse me, don't mind me saying, but that small camera is very dangerous. It can leak classified information of our military camp. In order to not get all of us into trouble, I suggest you throw your iPad into the sea now! Commanders may come at any time. Now, I suggest that everyone here throw you into the sea. Now, I suggest that you go to the toilet and shit. If anything happens, your chance of becoming an officer is gone. Just go. Don't teach me what to do. I know what I'm doing, but you don't. Better take care of yourselves. Let him be. Lobang, what are you doing? We'll record what you want to say and upload it online. Show it to the whole world. But we have to act fast. Make the bunk beds not look like bunk beds. -Okay. -Hey, Muthu. You be the sentry. Hey, Lobang. Why am I the sentry? Fine, don't do it. You do it, foreigner. Hey, you stay there! Don't you steal my job. You stay, I go. Hey, I'll join him. Not as sentry, but to recce. That's cooler. Hey, you guys are too much! I'm Singaporean and so are my parents. I'm Singaporean too. And I'm serving in the army. I'll be fighting too if a war breaks out. You guys are so mean! Yes, sorry for being mean. Now, we are one man short. Can I help? -You want to help? -Yes. Don't regret it. What do you want me to do? Lead actress. Hey, bitch. I'm telling you now. You didn't dump me. I dumped you! Want to know why? Because hugging you is like hugging a washing board. No boobs, no bum! Buck-toothed and smelly mouth! Kissing you is like kissing shit. It made me vomit for days! This is version five. You're still in version one. Let me show you what real breasts should look like. Come see for yourself! It's a D cup, right? See this? Thank you so much, you rag-and-bone man, for taking the washing board from me. Let me give you a word of advice. Enemy spotted! Room! Room! Section 2 is on the ball today! All of you are already in position before I stepped into the room. Are you going on a date? You're supposed to be in your admin. Yes, Platoon Sergeant. Lobang, what's going on? Nothing? So why is your bed messy like a brothel? And you! Is it showtime or what? No, Platoon Sergeant. Bloody hell. Why are the sheets and blankets all over the place? Like your grandma's house. No, Platoon Sergeant. Why is it decorated like a wedding night? Is this your grandma's house? No, Sergeant. Something fishy must be going on. Platoon Sergeant! Yes? Permission to go to the toilet, sir. Toilet? Right, go! I'm sure you're hiding something from me. Don't let me find out. Where's Ismail? You're not going to answer me? Never mind. I'll get to the bottom of this. -What's going on? -To the toilet. Let's go. The two of you check the other side. Permission to come inside the toilet, Sergeant? Come in. Why? Are you worried? No, we are here to pee. Hey, who used the toilet and didn't flush? -I don't know. -Bloody hell, you lot. Why? Never seen someone flush the toilet before? I'm not just your mom, I'm the maid too. Sergeant Ong, I found it. Okay, no wonder you're so worried. Hey. Why are you peeing for so long? All of you are here because nobody in the platoon is man enough to admit whom the cigarettes belong to! Platoon, at attention! Left turn. Right turn. To the rear. Left turn. Right turn. To the rear. Quick march in place. -Left, right! -Left, right! March and stop. Left turn, and again. March! -Left, right! -Left, right! To the rear! -Left, right! -Left, right! To the rear! -Left, right! -Left, right! To the rear! Lobang, we got punished with the defaulter's parade because of your stupid idea. I think you should apologize to us. Please don't say that, Wayang. We are all from the same section. Hello, this is why I have to speak up so that the whole section doesn't get into trouble again. I don't like to suffer for nothing again. Wayang, he's trying to help me. What happened was beyond our control. Please don't blame him. Blame me. It's my fault. It's not your fault. It's your girlfriend's. No, it's the bastard's fault. If that bastard didn't steal IP Man's girl, he would still be living in bliss. Come take a look! -What is it? -What's that? -See this bastard. -Do you know who I am? I'm the handsome guy who stole your girlfriend! I'm warning you. You dare to challenge me? You shit. Honestly, I really pity you. You're stuck in Tekong and your girlfriend left you. Yet there's nothing you can do. Except to moan about it online. You even got fake big boobs to insult my darling? Shame on you! Do you know why she doesn't like you? Because you are skinny, small, and short! She gets no security, no excitement! But things are different with me. I bring out the best in her. I doubt you get the message with your low IQ. Let me demonstrate with my darling for you. Watch and learn. What? What are they doing? This bastard. This guy has gone overboard. Do you feel bad? I'm so sorry. I'll now show you something more devastating. I can't believe he did that! That's too much! Don't do that. You'll get punished! Get up. Aloysius. This shit happened today. You're his buddy. Any suggestions? There's no need to do anything. Don't do anything? What kind of a buddy are you? Trust me. After a while, it should be okay. Please, guys. Let's just carry on with our training and not create any more problems. IP Man, I really feel bad for you. When something happens to you, your buddy will do nothing to help you. Listen up. He will not do anything. Hello, you're right. Sometimes doing nothing is better than doing the wrong thing. Buddy, don't be sad. I'll help you overcome the difficult time, not create another problem. This is how a buddy helps. Got it? Listen to me, guys. Wayang has a point. IP Man, you're my brother. Listen to me. Just focus on the training. Everything will be okay. You all saw what the bastard did to me! How am I supposed to keep quiet? He kissed my girlfriend and show it to the whole world! Who knows what he's going to do next? I'm sure they're sleeping together. I'm sure of it. Hey, I'm really disappointed with you. You are talking just like him. Right. I forgot you want to go to OCS too. You want to be the best recruit. Fine, get lost. We are your best brothers. Just tell us how you want us to help. That bastard should be beaten up and fed with shit! We can't kill him, but we can feed him shit. I have a plan. Who's in? Lobang, what's your plan? Detail 1, load magazine. Detail 2 and 3, wait outside. Own time, own target, carry on! Rifle jammed! What do you want to do? I want them to have the smelliest and spiciest shit. Sweet. Here's your load-bearing vest. Put all your ammo in there. That's our ammo box. Basic Military Training taught us. What must we do before every mission? -Camouflage. -Camouflage. -Sweet. -We came prepared. What are you doing? This is for military use. Putting that on is like telling everyone you're an army boy. So what do we do? We have our own ideas. Lobang, your idea is great. Everyone is camouflaged. Can't tell who's who. Where did you learn this? Don't you read the newspapers? People who leave the court and avoid the press all dress like this. Can't tell who is who. Don't laugh. Maybe someday, you'll dress like this too. We look cool. But it's too hot. Remove them. Here's the map. We will use army tactics. Left flank, right flank. Flank from every direction. Destroy him. Yes, destroy him! According to the intel we've gathered from that bastard's social media, he likes to eat upstairs, then come to this car park for... live firing. "Live firing"? Calm down, man. You're about to get back at them. Now, I want Group 1 to move in to confirm the target. Use this army-issued masking tape on the door. What for? If they want to return fire, they'll be stuck. We will be able to escape. Understand? Okay, while Group 1 is at the car, Group 2, I want you to come to this location. It's your FUP. What's FUP? Form up point. Stay there and wait for my command. Group 3 will go to this location. This is our form up point. Okay. When the recce platoon is ready, they'll give the good sign. Then, I'll give you the signal to knock on the window. They will wind down the window. Attack from the outside! All of you will then run in and throw the shit bombs. Go to hell! Fall back! Hey, stop right there! Hello, someone threw shit at me. Go after them! Go! Run! Run! No way, why is there a wall? Stop running! Hey! -Stop! -Get them! Hey, lift me up! Stupid! Use the staircase! -Let's split up. Be careful! -Okay! Shit! Hurry! They're catching up! Thank goodness for physical training. Sharp corner! Freeze! -Hey! -Wait for me! Hurry, go! Go, don't stop! Hurry up! Hurry! Go! Run! They are catching up! It's a dead end. -Shit. -Don't run! Don't run! It's a dead end. Hey, buddy! Hey, what should we do? A dead end. They're coming. Think of something! If we fight, we'll be charged. Calm down, no worries. Hurry! They're coming! What? You prepared a rope? Smart thinking. Quick, climb! Faster! Come on! My arms are weak. I can't even do push-ups! When we get back, you better go for remedial training. -Faster! -Faster! Don't run! Come on, just do it! Stop right there! Hey, don't run! Throw down the rope if you have the guts. What? You want it? Here. -Go to hell! -Go to hell! Stop right there! Did you see the bastard with all that shit? He almost made me vomit. We added chili and wasabi to the shit bombs. He must be really suffering! I really think you are the best recruit and the best brother! -Awesome! -Awesome! Okay, chill. -Don't know what they did this time. -Hopeless. -Drinks on me! Order anything you want! -Sweet. No worries, green tea for everyone. -Okay. -Yes. We have to be careful. That bastard has a gang behind him. Fear not! We're a gang too. The Section 2 Gang! That's cool. Guys, how did it go? The best recruit is showing us concern. I'm so moved, my hair is standing on end. Can you go eat shit over there? Stop bothering us. Don't be late later. Fold smart four. Damn you! Shit. Section 2, fall back! -Fall back! -Fall back! Hurry, fall back! Go! -Quick, run! -Quick! Ninja Company, listen up! This is a very serious matter! I need everyone to be here! Platoon 1! -Yes, Sergeant Major! -Yes, Sergeant Major! Platoon 2! -Yes, Sergeant Major! -Yes, Sergeant Major! Platoon 3! -Yes, Sergeant Major! -Yes, Sergeant Major! Sir, all the men are here. Gentlemen. Earlier this evening, at approximately 1930 hours, a fight broke out around the area of White Sands. The entire incident was captured by a police CCTV. And it clearly shows that seven of our recruits were involved in the fight. If you're one of those who were involved, please step forward. Come on, gentlemen! Be a man! Own up to your mistakes. Ninja Company has no room for cowards! If you did it, step forward! You bunch, report to my office now. What are you waiting for? Christmas? Go to the office now! Platoon Sergeant, take over! You are trained to be soldiers. To defend our country and not hooligans or pranksters. Throwing shit at people? Do you realize just how childish that is? How lucky are you? There were no serious injuries or casualties and the police are not pressing any charges. But you will receive formal military punishment. Understood? -Yes, sir. -Yes, sir. Do you think that you are a fighter? Can any good come from fighting? Does fighting make you a hero? Then why did you fight? Sir, the reason I fought was not because I wanted to be a hero. It was because I saw my friends being beaten up. It would've been wrong to just abandon them. The army always says, "Leave no man behind." It is my duty to protect my section mates and my buddies, sir. Helmets off! Hey buddy, is it heavy? Need me to carry your rifle or field pack? It's okay. Give me a chance to pay you back. You saved my life. Just tell me how. Okay, stop smoking. Get everyone to stop smoking too. It's like asking me and the rest to die. Why don't you just shoot me? You owe your life to me, so I can do whatever I like with it. Sweet, let's do it your way then. -You're the man. -Likewise. Buddy, I've got jerky. Buddy. Where did you keep it? It's my secret weapon. I can't tell you. Guys, do you want some sour plums? No, thank you. Sour plums? You're so fast on the 2.4km run. I admire your speed. When your friends were in trouble, you also ran very fast. So amazing! No, I didn't run away. I was... Hey guys, let's not bring that up. He ran off to call the police. But the police station was in Tekong. That's enough, let's move on. Platoon Sergeant taught us to leave no man behind. You went one step further. You left all the men behind. All right, it was my mistake. Please forgive me. Okay? -Coward. -Coward. Echo after me! Echo after you! -Training to be cowards -Training to be cowards -Fight for myself -Fight for myself -Whole of my life -Whole of my life -Leave all men behind -Leave all men behind -Have you ever wondered -Have you ever wondered -Why I ran away? -Why I ran away? -Because I wanted to call the police -Because I wanted to call the police -But the police station is in Tekong! -But the police station is in Tekong! What? You cannot come home this Friday? Why? Your section mates got into a fight and you went to help them? Are you mad? That's very dangerous, you know? Did you forget what your uncle told you? In the army, you must avoid duty, fake illness, and hide. Remember? Hold on. Your son. His section mates got into a fight and he went to help them. He helped them? Yes, he helped them. -Good. -What? Ken, I believe your dad is mad. I told him about it and do you know what he said? "Good," and then he gave me that crooked smile of his. You got to go? Okay, I love you. Don't be a hero. Take care-- Ken! Take care. Your section mates were beaten up by gangsters and you running away is perfectly logical and acceptable! I don't see any problem with that. The army trains you to fight enemies, not gangsters. Permission to sit down, Platoon Sergeant. Have a seat. Thank you, Platoon Sergeant. Platoon Sergeant, I think the whole platoon is against me. May I kindly request that you transfer me to another company? Aloysius, transferring you to another company will not help at all. I know you're a very good soldier. You have great knowledge about the army. But you don't know how to work with the people around you. Do you know that? Is that so? But I've always been very helpful by advising my section mates. I've been very generous with my knowledge. I just want them to be as good as me. Okay, let me ask you. Is knowledge more important or the camaraderie with your section mates? Camaraderie, of course. But don't you think knowledge is also important? That's what you say, but that is not the case. I know you always help your section mates. But the way you do it makes them think you are better than them. Do you realize that? Really? But don't you think I'm... Better than them? That's your problem right there. You need to find a balance between the two. That will be the solution to your problem. Understand? I know you can do it. Thank you, Platoon Sergeant. No problem. Hi, guys. What do you guys want to eat? I'll bring it back. Fast food? Fried chicken? Instant coffee for you, Lobang? You're buying food for us? Will you poison us? When you book out, watch out for oncoming traffic. Guys, leave him alone. Just buy anything that's convenient for you. Don't worry about it. You ran when there's a fight. Now you want to buy our friendship back? Fall in. Stoppages of Leave squad to attention! Turn left. Turn check. -I was just talking to them. -This is bad! Left, left, right, left. I demand a proper explanation! Why are you charging my son with that? You take over. Regarding this case, some of your points are worth exploring. So the Commanding Officer asked me to speak to you. Regarding this matter, we are very worried, but we are also happy. My son fought in order to help his section mates. Haven't you noticed? That you've succeeded in training a real soldier? So why are we now punishing him? I don't understand the message you're sending? Please pass this on to my son. Recruit Chow, after much consideration, we've decided to make an exception in your case. Your leave suspension ends today. Sir, what about my section mates? They will still have to serve their SOL. Sir, if that's the case, may I request permission to continue my SOL with them? Permission granted. Thank you, sir. How many times must I tell you? No outside food. My mom got this for me. She says this is to make up for the tough training. It's my fault. -You eat. -I eat? No. One, Sergeant. Two, Sergeant. Anyone not feeling well? -No, sir! -No, sir! Gentlemen, every time the training gets harder, one thought will come to your mind. "Why must I serve National Service?" My answer is if not you, who else? Field camp is the most important part of the recruit's training. It's where we learn many skills to adapt to outfield situations. Most of us are used to an urban lifestyle, but now we have to survive without showers for four days. We also fight with mosquitoes and all kinds of insects. It's a big challenge. Despite all the tough training together, the toughest part for Aloysius is that he can't escape the trouble that is coming for him during this field camp. Even when Wayang King is sitting down and not doing anything, he could still get into trouble. Enough. Leave him alone. -Ready, fire! -Ready, fire! Buddy, do you need me? I'm going to shit. Remember to say, "Excuse me." Confinement! Platoon, fall in! -Fall in. -Fall in. Fall in! Hurry up! Faster! I'm doomed. I lost my magazine. -Where is it? -I don't know. Hurry. -Where's your magazine? -I lost it. Before you move out, we'll do an equipment check. Check your rifle parts. The first thing to check is your ammo pouch. -Checked. -Checked. Next, your gas regulator. -Checked. -Checked. Your muzzle. -Checked. -Checked. Lastly, check your magazine. -Checked. -Those without one, go and sound off with me now. Sergeant, I lost my magazine. When did you lose it? Just now, Platoon Sergeant. Where did you lose it? I don't know, Platoon Sergeant. You're usually careful. What happened this time? Gentlemen! Make sure that you search every square inch of this forest for that missing magazine! Because if you don't, none of us are leaving. Is it you? Is something wrong with your brain? Or are you deaf? How many times have you sabotaged him? Can't you just give him a break? Okay, fine. Aloysius, it's my fault this time. But you're the man this time. Cool! My foot! Where's the magazine? I don't know. I threw it from here. It's up on the tree. If the Olympics had this event, I'd win for sure. In your dreams. Hey, guys. Be very careful tonight. Protect your wife properly. Don't let any random guy come in and steal her away from you. Good night. -Sergeant! No, don't! -Quiet! -Sergeant, no! -Quiet. -It's painful! Please, don't! -I said be quiet! Good that you're alert. Go to sleep. -Thank you, Sergeant. -Sleep. Damn you! Tried to steal my rifle? Platoon Sergeant. So sorry. You asked me to protect my rifle with my life. I'm sorry. You... Well done. "Well done?" What happened? I kicked the Sergeant in the face and he said to me, "Well done." Really? Is your rifle new? It's so short. Your rifle must be light. I envy you. Gentlemen, we conducted a rifle raid last night. I'm very disappointed that some of you did not take care of your rifle. All those who lost your rifle, raise your hand. Recruit, why didn't you raise your hand? Sir, I only lost half of it. Luckily, I still have the other half. Bloody hell! Still dare to talk nonsense. Never mind. Those who lost your rifle, report to your CSM for punishment. Is that clear? -Yes, sir! -Yes, sir! Hey, buddy. Don't you feel that digging this shell scrape is like digging our own grave? With two joss sticks in front. In this crazy, hot weather. I'm melting. There is a way to cool yourself down. How? Just imagine you're surrounded by fans right now. They're all blowing at us. How nice! That's the best you can do? My imagination is better. I imagine... I imagine lying in bed with two beautiful girls wearing bikinis sleeping with me. Nice. Look over there. They still have to train. Tough luck. They should be like me. Such beautiful girls. I'm happy. Bikini girl? Where would you find bikini girl at the training? Bikini Sergeant would be better. Recruit, wake up! Damn it! No way. You're such a party pooper. We are this tired. Can't I daydream for a bit? Okay. Now these bikini girls are lying in the bathtub with me. Bathing me. But that's not enough. I get them to turn on the water. Give me a shower. Nice. It's raining! The sun is still out. The weather is really the worst! Hey, buddy. Category 1! -Category 1! -Category 1! Who said it's Category 1? Every single one of you will continue digging! This is just a little bit of rain! Are you afraid of getting wet? No, Platoon Sergeant. Are you a bunch of sissies? No, Platoon Sergeant. Then, man up and continue digging, understand? Yes, Platoon Sergeant. Platoon 2, dig deeper! You're digging a shell scrape. Not a jacuzzi! Arty incoming! Take cover! If you don't take cover, you will die! Take cover! Do you not understand? -Arty! -Arty! Arty over! Keep your heads down. -Recover! -Keep your heads down. Recover! Move it! Recover! Faster! -Arty! -Arty! If you don't take cover, you'll die! -Arty! -Arty! Lobang, there's a mosquito on your face. I know. It's okay. Let it suck my blood. I'm too tired. Hey buddy, you've got mud on your face. This is not mud. This is my homeland. Have I not made it clear to all of you? You shouldn't conduct arty drills or steal their rifles during field camp. Do you realize how many complaints from the parents that we've received? Saying we're making their lives unnecessarily difficult. But sir, we're willing to face the consequences if it means that our men learn the importance of protecting their rifles. Sir, without the arty drills, how will the recruits learn how to react in the event of an artillery strike? I think it's essential. Gentlemen, this is the year 2013. Not 20 or 30 years ago. Times have changed. It's a new generation of recruits and we have to change with the times. For disobeying my direct orders, each of you will sign seven extras. By the way, if any of you are not happy with me, you can get your mom to file a complaint. Right, we also have moms. Moms. Are you all okay? -Yes, Sergeant. -Yes, Sergeant. Are you feeling tired? -No, Sergeant. -No, Sergeant. Gentlemen, I know a lot of you know that this is the moment when we present to you the letters from your parents. But there is one thing you guys do not know. A lot of your parents sent the letters to the wrong company. And in Ninja, our practice is to destroy all letters that were wrongly sent. Gentlemen. The pain and sense of loss that you feel right now from not being able to read your parents' letters... It is nothing compared to if Singapore was really at war and you were to lose your parents and siblings. Your wife and children. That's why we train. That's why we put you through this hell. So that you don't ever have to feel that sense of pain and loss in real life. Your letters are right here, safe and sound. Dad can't talk properly yet. So I'll write everything I want to say here. After my stroke, I missed the simple things like walking and jogging. They are luxuries to me now. What I'm most afraid of is that you choose not to walk even though it's the easiest thing for you. Meanwhile, I can't walk even if that's what I want most. Remember. When you are still able to do things, you should do the best you can. Because you never know when a day would come where you would no longer be able to. You have a letter too? From my grandma. She can write? No. That's why I'm crying. You must treasure it. Wait. Why do you have a letter too? Actually, the Platoon Sergeant is a pretty nice guy. During Basic Military Training, we have to go through a situational test. Also known as the sit-test. It tests combat ability and everything we've learned in the past two months. It also evaluates our suitability for command school. Aloysious is this station's IC. All stations will have one assessor. Some of the assessors are our NS officers commonly known as Reservist officers. Sometimes, they just don't look like an officer, but they are real trained officers. Our mission is to save our men from a hut inside the forest, surrounded by enemies 1km away. IC, take cover! Go for it, Aloysious! Good luck! Recruit, what are you doing? Sorry, sir. I was just telling the section IC that I've got a stomachache. Did you invent this hand signal? No, sir, but the army never taught us the field signal for toilet. So you're going to drop the "bomb" before the enemy does? No, sir. But my shit is already at the hatch door. Are you more scared of the enemy or the shit coming out? Enemy, sir. You have to hold it in then. Yes, sir. Contacted! The enemy is here. Take cover! The enemy is here. Please, not now! Section, improve your cover! The rest, cover them! Fire! -Fire! -Bang! -Enemy straight ahead! -Enemy straight ahead! -Fifty meters. -Fifty meters! -Fire! -Fire! -Bang! -Bang! -Section! -IC move! -IC, move! -IC, move! Follow! -On! -On! IP Man, take cover! You're dead! -Sir, please! -The bullets were flying towards you. You're dead. Sir, I just wanted to make sure they are safe. You are not safe. Sir, I think you're a bit harsh on him. He just wanted to protect us. Shut up. Do you want to be a casualty? No. Sorry, sir. Sir, may I know which part of my body was shot? Why do you want to know? Technically speaking, if my legs and arms got blown off, I still have my mouth to lead my troop, sir. Your mouth fell to the ground. Your nose flew over there. Your ear flew behind. Your whole head exploded! You're dead. Section 2 IC! All men, throw your grenades! Kill the enemies! -Kill! -Hey! You are dead, how can you still talk? That was my dying breath, sir. Die properly. Lie down! The IC is dead. Where's the second IC? Hey, second IC! -You're the second IC? -Yes, sir. -Do you know what to do? -Yes, sir. Carry on. Yes, sir. Section, fall back! Steady. No need to fight. Hey, why did you call to fall back? Stop. Your mission is to save a man inside. The man is still inside. How dare you run away? What do you mean by fall back? Sir, let me explain. Exchanging one life with twelve is illogical. Just like in the movie Saving Private Ryan. So many men went to save just one and many more ended up dead. It's not worth it. This is thinking out of the box. Second IC! "Leave no man behind." I'm the IC now. Please respect my decision. It's for everyone's sake. I have no time for your nonsensical stories. A sniper hit you. You're dead! Now, the enemy is coming from that direction in 30 seconds. I want you to tell me who the third IC is. Yes, sir! -Do you know what to do? -Yes, sir. -Carry on. -Thank you, sir. Ken. Here, take this. Save the section. I'll do you proud. Hey, Kumar. Point the claymore that way. Quick! -Section! -Section. Fire movement to the rear! -Fire movement to the rear! -Move out. Wait! Come here, third IC! Very good. You know how to use claymores. But it's the wrong direction! It's supposed to kill the enemy over there. But you killed your whole section over here. Mission has failed. The section will carry your casualty to the next station. In every exercise, there's always a few sadistic assessors who love to choose the heaviest soldier as a casualty. Sorry, guys. Don't worry, I'll do something. They just enjoy seeing the whole group suffer. Luckily, the next station IC, Lobang King, has an idea to save the entire section. Sir, I have a stomachache. I need to go clear it. Go. Lobang King's idea is actually very simple. It's just called teamwork. Hey! -Aloysius, are you okay? -Are you okay? -Buddy! -Are you okay? Move away. -Are you okay? -Yes, sir. No more casualties. Keep the stretcher. Let's move on. Yes, sir. You're trying to scare me? I'm watching you. Every one of you. You and you-- Section to the rescue! Gather stones! Group 1 and 2! Group 3 follow me! Sir, throw away your food! The wild boars are going for your food! Come on, guys! Let's go! Find some stones! So many wild boars. Why are there so many? You think Tekong is your territory? It's ours, okay? Wild boars have reinforcements too. Yes, I can't believe it. Sir, don't come out. You're surrounded by wild boars. I'm injured. No worries, sir. Section 2 is here. We know what to do. Good. Stones, get them ready. Stones. -Attack! -Attack! Attack! Chase them off! Stretcher! Help me. One, two, up. Sir, now you're the casualty. Yes, I know. Thank you. Section 2 is actually the best section I've ever seen. -Thank you, sir! -Thank you, sir! Tighten the strap. Make it tight. I have bread. Do you want bread? Share with everyone. -It's okay. Keep it to yourself. -Put your hand here. Section 2, ready to move out! -Move out! -Move out! One, two, three, four. -Is everyone okay? -Okay. Together we will strive On and on and on Till the break of dawn Through all the times we had Where the day be good or bad We have stood together as comrades Day in, day out Training under the sun From all walks of life We have bonded as one These memories, I'll hold forever We are not just buddies We are a band of brothers Now as a boy in Singapore, We have done our thing After finishing, Wonder what the future will bring Will we still be close After time passes by? Or is this really the time When we say goodbye? Nobody really knows, but as time goes We all realize what matters is We were bros at one point in time We were all we had Sharing everything from soap to bread Some of us will go To Specialist Cadet School And some of us will go To Officer Cadet School But you know it really doesn't matter Who's the best Because at the end of the day, We represent the same crest I confess no less This is one of life's test Braving through the rain while we serve NS What we gain are moments That would flash as memories That remind us of when we were soldiers At the end of each batch of BMT, there will be a 24km route march. For the past nine weeks, we trained and sweated out together. We ate and shat together. We fooled around and got scolded together. Hey, behave! All of you are in uniform. Behave! Left, right! -Hi, army boys! -Look at you. We ran and fell together. We shouted and screamed together. We handled pressure together and smiled together. And the most important thing is... I am going. Okay, I'm sorry. We walked through the entire learning process and grew together. Like what our Platoon Sergeant said to us on the first day. In these nine weeks, we would definitely learn something that we will never forget. Take this. But there are still some people who never learn anything. They only believe in my uncle's philosophy. You won't be excused unless you pretend. The thing is if you continue to have that attitude after the NS, what kind of future will you have? What are you doing? -Sorry! -You are always like this. You're not a kid! Ninja warriors, endure! We are almost there! Ninja's duty is for the country. Push yourself! We are all very familiar with this place. But I never had a feeling like I'm having tonight. As I walk on this path again in my uniform... That's why I hate the army! I hate officers! Like what our Officer Commanding said, because of what we are wearing that is why we are able to celebrate National Day every year... together. Eyes front! Eyes left! -Ready! -March! Our handsome boy is over there.
