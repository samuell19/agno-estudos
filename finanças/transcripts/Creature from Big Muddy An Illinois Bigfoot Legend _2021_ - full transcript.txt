In the early 1970’s in Murphysboro, Illinois, the town was terrorized by a creature that was thought to come out of a local river called the Big Muddy. This river gave rise to the creature’s name: the Big Muddy Monster. But the sightings go back much further than the 1970s. In 1942 there was a flap about a creature terrorizing the region that was so startling to the community that newspapers warned children not to go into the woods by themselves. Livestock was found ripped apart and devoured by a creature that locals referred to as The Thing. The 50’s continued with sightings as workers at the Murphysboro iron and metal company had multiple reports of a creature that frequented the area. In 1968 another creature was reported, this one over ten foot tall that was referred to as the What’s It. But it was in the 1970’s that the area was a hotbed of paranormal activity consisting of curious sight seekers, amateur monster hunters and cryptozoologists. Then, during the summer of 1988, an incident occurred at a local salvage yard that resulted in yet another flurry of reports. Although the sightings tapered off, stories of the creature continue to this day. This is an investigative look into the legend of The Big Muddy Monster. [Three guitar notes plucked. Music changes to up-tempo, Usually the first thing that comes to mind when discussing bigfoot is the vast wilderness of the pacific northwest and surrounding areas. With its mountain ranges and deep, thick forests, the northwestern portions of the United States would seem to be a logical location for an undiscovered primate, if one truly exists. However, the legendary creature is reported to have been sighted by thousands of eyewitnesses across much of the country and especially in the Midwest. The southern Illinois landscape is rich in its biodiversity with its old growth forest, cedar swamps, soaring bluffs that seem to rise up out of the landscape around every corner and deep hallers making it prime habitat for a cryptid legend. It should come as no surprise that folklore of a bigfoot creature exists here, and Murphysboro found itself smack dab in the middle of the 1970’s flap that was captivating the nation at the time. I would describe Murphysboro as a place that has great pride in itself and in its traditions and in its stories. I think it’s a place that doesn’t mind to talk itself up. And it doesn’t mind people inside the community saying disparaging things even about the community but people outside the community better not say anything bad about us because we certainly take offense to that. Yeah, the residents of Murphysboro are a loyal set of folks. If you put forth an honest effort they will appreciate it. I was born in Duquoin and grew up in Carbondale –only came to Murphysboro in 2005– and this community has embraced me wholeheartedly. Murphysboro is a skeptical group. They don’t necessarily buy everybody that’s coming into town with a new product to sell or a get-rich-quick type of thing. They are a group that is questioning. And so you better have your facts together if you are gonna try to sell them something. And so, I’ve learned that as mayor, also. Well, you hear about the Big Muddy Monster –I grew up in Southern Illinois¬ from the time I was a child– you know my family, particularly my father, did a lot of hunting. Squirrel hunting, duck hunting, goose hunting…. I still a lot of that to this day. And so, there would be wise cracks made when you’re in the woods turkey hunting, you hear a stick break or something and you say, “Well maybe that’s the Big Muddy Monster.” You maybe see an unusual impression in the ground when you’re out in the woods, somewhere, and somebody says, “Well, maybe it’s the Big Muddy Monster. So these types of things weave themselves into the conversations the people have probably on a daily basis. Aside from the original investigators into the flap of the 70’s, possibly no others are as knowledgeable of the Big Muddy legend as authors Chad Lewis, Noah Voss, and Kevin Lee Nelson who in 2019 co-published a book documenting the many incidents surrounding the mystery. Lewis and Nelson agreed to return to the area for the making of this documentary. One of the first experts on the list was Michael Huntington, an author and researcher on the many phenomenon in the area. Huntington searches for some of the more bizarre tales and anomalous activity, and the Big Muddy Monster certainly fits the bill. Michael, you’ve been researching this area as an author and a lecturer on topics of the weird for a very long time. What do you remember about the Big Muddy legend? Well, here in Southern Illinois…I’m actually located in Missouri just on the other side of the river but the lore does permeate all throughout the river region… Murphysboro is known for its mud monster. He’s called Big Muddy by the people in the area, or the Big Muddy Monster, or Mongo. You know, there’s a couple of different names that he goes by. It all came from a number of encounters that occurred in 1973 through 1975 as well as some cases in the late 80’s. People in the Murphysboro area, which is located on the banks of the Big Muddy River, reported seeing an eight-foot tall, three hundred and fifty pound creature of some sort, some sort of ape-like creature that was white, with sort of a shaggy dog hair that was matted and muddy. A number of sightings occurred to the point where the police took interests. Hunters came from throughout the region to look for the monster. Nothing was really found other than some reports from people seeing and hearing the alleged creature and some tracks. Despite the absence of any mainstream media or even local awareness, strange sightings of the elusive cryptid did not end in the 70s and reports continue up to this day. Claims include roadside crossings, activity around homesteads, and even encounters with juveniles. Most reports come from area residents, not bigfoot hunters, lending some credence to the accounts. People do come out here and experience strange sounds. They listen to the Muddy waters and they wonder, “Could the mud monster be back?” And maybe he will come back, one day. Who knows? It almost seems to be a source of pride within the community, now. You know, where it’s their local legend and one that they own, themselves. Yeah, all of the local newspapers have reported on it the local news stations. The Mud Monster has been featured in several documentary television shows, and documentary films. So, you know, he’s definitely embraced by the region. And, I think, most people who have lived here a while… these towns… the big towns around here tend to be big college towns so people come and go. But people who live in the area for a good long while are very familiar with the lore of the Mud Monster. In truth, there are more people who believe the idea of an undiscovered, giant primate to be incredulous versus those who even entertain the idea of the possibility the species actually exists. Even more rare are those who claim to have had direct encounters and are willing to come forward with their claims. Christian Baril had an intense moment in his childhood that left an imprint of fear for the rest of his life. His brief but terrifying brush with the unknown was substantiated by other eyewitnesses, including the Murphysboro Police Department. So Christian, we’re in the backyard. This is where the incident took place. Take us back there. Yeah. It’s been a long time since I’ve been back here. I’m fifty years old now. Back in 1973, the summer of 1973, I was living in this house with my mother and father and my little sister. My sister would have been about a year old. It was a warm summer night. There were fireflies out. I was in the backyard. We had a little sandbox back there. My parents were in the kitchen. They could see out the back window. I was probably fifty seventy-five yards away from them. I can remember all the lights being on in the house and it wasn’t dark, completely, but it was getting dark. In another twenty minutes it would be dark. I was out there chasing fireflies with my friend Jack from next door. He was probably around five…four or five. Jack had to go home so Jack went off to his house, next door. I was still out there chasing fireflies and I do not remember seeing whatever it was. I mean I do not know what it was. I don’t have a memory of seeing it but I have a very strong memory of being afraid and spinning around on the balls of my feet, seeing the house and seeing the house all lit up and thinking one word, “Momma.” …and just running as fast as I could back to that house. I can still remember to this day, that’s what I remember most is running back to the house and being afraid. So then after that, our neighbors were teenagers and they were on a date. They were sitting in the porch swing. They were just hanging out talking. The girl’s parents lived right here next door. They had two or three sons and one daughter. The parents were a nice family. Real conservative. The girl and the guy apparently saw something come up out of the woods. They went in and told her mom and her mom called my mom. Their parents were probably a good fifteen maybe twnety years older than my parents. They were like a generation older. Their mom said, “What should I do?” My mom said… at that point she started putting everything together and said, “Call the police." Perhaps the most widely known sighting of the Big Muddy Monster took place at Riverside Park On June 25, 1973, what some refer to as the “lover’s lane” incident occurred in the boat ramp parking lot area. Many point to this sighting as definitive proof of the monster while others believe it to be an obvious hoax. Whichever the case, It would become the match that lit the fuse to the biggest explosion of Muddy Monster sightings to hit the area in decades. So I’m here at Riverside Park and this is where the story really exploded. In was back in June 25 of 1973, just before midnight, when a couple of lovebirds pulled into the parking lot. They were just getting settled in when all of a sudden they heard a growl or a shriek that they couldn’t identify. Really scared them. That’s when they noticed an odd smell in the air. As they were trying to figure out what was going on, some giant, eight foot, bigfoot looking creature, white-furred, caked with mud from its bottom half, seemingly coming out of the river toward their car. They were so terrified they shot off towards the police station. Police sent two officers out to respond. When the officers got here they could smell an odd smell in the area, too. They also discovered giant footprints in the mud. The river had been flooded out recently and they saw much bigger than a human footprint. They went out to get boots to go investigate into the woods and while they came back they were joined by the original witness and an officer, a deputy with the sheriff’s department. When I spoke with him, he told me that you could see something big was leaving indentations. Even though it didn’t look like a human He was also convinced it wasn’t someone in a suit playing around. He said at that time it was gun country. Everybody was carrying a weapon. Nobody would be foolish enough to come out in a costume and risk getting shot. So they could hear the creature but they didn’t see it. There was no scat, no hair… nothing left behind but the footprints. About 3am they concluded the investigation, thinking that was the end of the story. Little did they know it was just the beginning. As the saying goes, there’s always two sides to every story. Well known paranormal researcher Bruce Cline of the little Egypt Ghost Society threw one of the biggest wrenches into the Big Muddy waters when he claimed to know a credible acquaintance who just may have hoaxed the legend to life. So we’re here along the shores of the Big Muddy River in Riverside Park. Bruce, you grew up here so I was wondering if you had any particular stories you could tell us, or some of your background with this legend. Actually, I grew up in Harrisburg about forty miles east of here. It was in the mid-seventies I was in high school there. Seventy to seventy four. And around that time there was a lot of sighting of a creature around here called the Big Muddy Monster, and the MOMO Monster. It was quite a big flap back then so it got a lot of people excited. I remember we’d get up groups of people. We go out around the edge of the Shawnee National Forest there near Harrisburg… Go out in the forest looking for this Big Muddy Monster creature. A lot of the guys would have their shotguns and were going to shoot whatever they found. Looked around but never found anything. It was a big flap back then. A lot of people looking for it. So back then people took it very seriously? It was a real thing that was happening not just tall tales? Exactly. There was sightings all of the time, reported, and people actively looking for it all of the time. From the seventies on where there still accounts? Were people still talking about it in the mid-eighties? Well, maybe into the early eighties and then it tapered off after that. As a researcher, have you talked to people who believe they have encountered it or spotted it? I’ve talked to some people, especially one in particular, who claims he was responsible for it. Yeah, you have this story of this acquaintance of yours. Tell that. Okay. This acquaintance, I’ll call him Willy because he doesn’t want his real identity known… I worked with him locally for seven years. Willy, he was an amateur filmmaker that was very big into special effects. He would make his own costumes. He would go around to the movie fests where that had actual movie artifacts and costumes. He would learn part of the trade from the actual filmmakers. He was big into science fiction. He had quite an imagination. It was in I believe 1973, Willy got together with a couple of his associates and thought it would be pretty fun to make up this creature costume of this big, hairy river monster. So they got this costume. It was furry hairy... about seven foot tall. They caked the fur with some river mud from here. They went to their garage workshop and brewed up this special stink juice called, "Eau de Sasquatch.” It was just horrible. I mean a horrible smell. And they made recordings of these creature sounds like grunts and growls and screeches. Their theory was that they were going to come out here some night, set it up in this general area by the boat dock… “Cause at the time this area was popular especially on the weekends with teenagers. They would come out here parking. And they were gonna scare the bejesus out of people. So they put on that costume. They had their recordings of the creature sounds. They had their stink juice in little aerosol sprayers and they waited over there in the tree line. Pretty soon a couple pulls up here in a car. It was right up in here. They waited a little bit and made sure they got involved in the car a little bit. Okay, now is our time. So they started spraying this stink juice around and there was a slight breeze that drifted right into the car. About then, they came out of the tree-line. One of the guys had on this big creature costume caked in mud and fur all over it. The stink juice was coming across and they hit the recordings of all those sounds and he came out like that. People saw that and it scared the tar out of them. They started up their cars, spun their wheels, and went right downtown to the police station and reported it. What do you think about people saying it was someone hoaxing it or several people hoaxing it? Because everyone we’ve spoken to from officers that were there that night to just general people that live in the region say that this is gun country. No one is going to be running around in a costume afraid to get shot. What are your thoughts on that? Well it definitely is rural America, here. People are inclined to use their weapons when confronted by something frightening. But I don’t know. As to a possible hoax, a hoax is possible certainly. Somebody could have made some sort of outfit, some sort of costume, to fool people. But the problem is, when you get into descriptions of the creature itself, it’s eight feet tall, three hundred and fifty pounds. That’s a feat in itself to find somebody to fit inside of that suit. And also the number of sightings and locations were so divergent at times that it was unlikely that it was one or just a small group of people pulling off all of them. So the contention is, at least among cryptozoologists, is that there is enough evidence to suggest there was some sort of cryptid here. There’s really no evidence to speak of other than some antidotal accounts, rumors of people having been involved in a hoax. Nothing really has been substantiated to a satisfying degree. So the monster does remains a monster. It remains an anomalous creature that has not been explained. Perhaps the most credible evidence of Big Muddy comes from an average family whose matriarch had a typical, momentary road crossing encounter during the peak of the 70’s sightings. Jessica Van Pelt possesses a family heirloom that is ambiguous and inconclusive yet very intriguing, and it could be the last surviving, physical evidence from the alleged creature. So during the sightings of the mid-seventies, Jessica, your family had a unique encounter with the Big Muddy Monster. Can you tell us a little bit about that? My grandmother worked midnights at the hospital. She worked in the ER. She was on her way home from the hospital and between Gorham and Route 3 she saw something go across the road. And it startled her enough that she come home visibly shooken by it. She then proceeded to tell my grandpa and my dad. So then my dad and…I don’t know who all went with him…at least my dad, they went out to see if they could find anything. They did find a footprint. At that time my dad was a Boy Scout troupe leader and so he had taken the boy scouts back out, I think it was like the following day, and they made a cast of the impression of the footprint. I’ve had it in my possession all this time since the seventies. Over time its just… Nobody even asked about it for the longest time. It was just part of our family history. But you valued it enough to hold onto it after all these years. Oh yes. It was, my dad you know he was a big outdoorsman. And so yeah. It was part of our family story. We knew how important it was to him. Sure. So this is the impression. They took the cast that they made and then they pushed it into some plaster and made this impression that we have here. We actually had the actual cast for many years and it sat in a basement and just over the years it deteriorated. Yeah they can be very fragile. I used to take it to school for show and tell. I mean like that was a big thing. We were gonna have show and tell. “Let’s take the footprint.” So what was your family’s basic belief on whether… Did they believe this creature was real? Did they think someone was hoaxing? What were their thoughts on this. My grandma was a very strict Catholic woman and she never… I mean I can say without a shadow of a doubt that my gradma never told a lie. She just didn’t make stuff up so If she said she say something she saw it. And that’s exactly the family’s belief, the whole family’s belief, that yeah, she saw it. For them to know how she came home and how it affected her, there was no doubt. Was she more, would you say, more excited or more fearful? No. I think she was scared. Okay. Originally she was scared. Now, she drove that same road every day to go to work so…. It wasn’t, It wasn’t like she So it wasn’t a normal occurrence. And it wasn’t something that kept her off the road. She just thought, “Maybe I’ll see it again.” As grandkids and now great grandkids, when we drive down certain areas of route 3 and of Gorham we always think, “Maybe we’ll see it too.” So your family was very familiar with local wildlife. If they saw something that was out of the ordinary they would know Yes. And not mistake it for something else. Oh, no. And that’s exactly… grandma, I mean she drove the back roads because it’s a very rural area. Other than trailer trucks and farm equipment, that’s what you have on the roads. People going to and from work, that’s it. And then you have deer, coons, skunks, stuff like that. No. She knew what she saw. Biologist Tony Gerard may be the most level headed bigfoot researcher and enthusiast in all of southern Illinois. Gerard is actually a huge skeptic of the paranormal and cryptids but is open minded to the fact that a phenomenon does exist and is willing to investigate reports in order to reach his own conclusions. So Tony, as a biology teacher and living here your whole life, what kind of creatures live in this area that you’re aware of that could be anything like what people assume are bigfoot? Is there anything that would be even remotely similar? Now? Absolutely not. Historically, we had a lot of black bear here. I expect to see black bear back here in my lifetime. They’ve expanded into Arkansas from Missouri and occasionally we get one wondering across the river into here but nowadays nothing like that. So, we’ve both heard some of the recordings that people have got in the Shawnee Forest that are kind of interesting. So if not bigfoot what do you think these calls are that people are saying are bigfoot? Well, in my opinion, the vast majority of things that people think are bigfoot are one of two things. They are some kind of candid, usually coyotes or young coyotes or dogs, or they’re a barred owl. Because a barred owl… boy they can let out a screech that will just raise your hair but it’s an owl. And I think a lot of people who are not deeply familiar with that kind of stuff often mistake it for something wild. Stan Courtney is a well respected bigfoot researcher who has spent countless hours trying to obtain audio evidence of primate activity in southern Illinois. He willingly shares his recordings and maintains a free database on his website. These are some of the samples he has obtained over the years. So, of course there’s the famous bigfoot video that everyone’s familiar with. People have been picking that apart for decades saying it’s a man in a suit but so far, it’s pointing that it may not be. Nothing I ever shot when I was involved in that sort of thing, nothing we tried to recreate ever looked that good. Now having said that, that’s what… forty-fifty years old at this point? Everybody has a video camera, better than the camera they used at that point, in their pocket and nobody has gotten anything better in the meantime? There again I don’t know what to do with that. So in your opinion based on the size of this area could it even support a creature the size of bigfoot? Yeah absolutely. Can we have a big, omnivorous mammal around here? Sure. We had back in the seventeen, eighteen hundreds a really large black bear population in this area. There’s plenty of habitat. There’s plenty of food resources and things like that. Now, to me, do I think after four hundred, gun toting years of U.S. history that we just happened to overlook a giant ape or some un-described hominid? No, I don’t. But, I’ve talked to enough sincere people I really believe. I believe there is an actual phenomenon. What it is I don’t know. Folkore is a way for a culture to pass along moral lessons and helpful information to help guide the less experienced through life. Area author and historian Jon Musgrave believes there is a logical explanation to the Big Muddy stories that’s rooted more in the traditional realm than the physical. We always want to believe that there’s more out there, that we haven’t solved everything, we haven’t found all the answers. And the idea that, oh is there bigfoot? Does bigfoot exist anyplace. Does he exist here in Southern Illinois? Probably not. But we have stories of bears long after bears were supposed to be around. The story. The background. Is it just a prank? I have come across bigfoot pranks and hoax stories dating back to at least the 1930’s where kids would basically make snowshoes to make footprints in the snow and trick their neighbors even during back during the depression. We’ve seen it during different time periods. And I’ve heard people tell me, “Oh yeah, that’s so and so’s husband that was doing here in Murpysboro. I think as individuals we are drawn to the stories kind of beyond the edge; the ones that we don’t think are true but sometimes when you look into them they actually are true or they’re really close to being true. Just like I think some of the stories about ghosts are a way to preserve the story of a crime that took place I think monster stories in many ways are either a morality tale or it’s a safety lesson. You tell kids that there’s a troll underneath the bridge because you want them to stay away from the edge of the bridge. There’s a monster in the pond.. don’t go… you know that keeps little kids from going next to the pond when there’s not adult supervision. Founder Zach Starrick and team member Ben Bishop of the Southern Illinois Monster Hunters have a different point of view than skeptics when it comes to the existence of the southern Illinois sasquatch, and they were more than willing to share personal experiences. Their familiarity with vocalizations, strange happenings, and tales of up close encounters paint quite a picture of the possibility of a giant ape in the woods. What really got me into it is when I had my first encounter whenever I was nine years old, in Randolph County, Illinois. We’d just come home from a baseball game in St. Louis and we’re in the garage and we had just heard this big howl outside. It scared me to death, being nine years old you would understand. Being a little kid you don’t know what’s going on. It wouldn’t be until ten years later whenever I found the Ohio moaning call that Matt Moneymaker and the BFRO recorded back in ’94. That was darn near accurate of what I heard that night. Well, growin’ up I was an outdoorsman. I’d hunt and I’d fish with my grandfather out here on our property. I know quite a bit like what the wildlife consists of here in Southern Illinois. Especially in Randolph County. I mean, we’ve got deer, coyotes. We’ve got raccoons, bobcats, mountain lions. I go and I try to go study up on their habits what kind of vocalizations they make. It was just something I couldn’t put my finger on. And trust me I tried to go and rule in out, what it was. But it just didn’t pan out to where I could actually put my finger on what it was until ten years later and I found that recording. And I’m like, “Holy crap! This is what I heard.” In my opinion, the bigfoot in southern Illinois, whenever it comes to being passive or aggressive, it’s a mix of both. I have had encounters where they have been observant and watched me from afar. And then I’ve had encounters where I’ve actually been run out of the woods. I’ve been run out of the woods, a couple years ago at night, by a big alpha male that just pushed down a whole tree and took off running after me, charging. Well I took off running. Do I feel like I was going to die that night if I didn’t get out? Yeah. I do believe so. I believe I had overstepped my boundaries and walked into their territory. I was getting too close to something that they were protective over - whether it be young whether it be what I call the harem which is all of their females are put together where the alpha male breeds with the females. It could have been one or two of those things or could have been too close to ground zero – Its home. It just depends on what you do, really. Like the old saying, “Don’t poke the bear.” You know, it’s gotta be this big, this big ape. For thousands of years things evolve. We’ve evolved over time. This thing has roamed the woods and seen civilization just boom and just get pushed farther and farther back. And he’s grown into himself just like we all have. I mean he’s… they say he’s over seven foot tall and huge stride. He’s gotta be a giant ape that’s just continued to grow. I’ve had a couple people now that I’ve kinda told a couple stories to, they’ve kinda come out of the woodwork, “Oh yeah. About seven or eight years ago I was out in the woods and heard something. Didn’t really know what it was.” Just written it off as a bobcat or something like that. A guy that’s actually from West Frankfort, where I’m from, he told me he had seen one out in the tree line behind his house which is a place I actually ride four wheelers at. So that’s always nice to know that it’s right there up close and personal with you at all times. I think bigfoot can find shelter in just about anywhere. In southern Illinois we’ve got so many cave systems, woods, to old, abandoned houses and pole barns. I mean even just broken down pole barns that are bent over and crust you could easily just scoot stuff around and live in that. Perhaps the most controversial explanations regarding bigfoot involve it being an interdimensional creature, one that travels to a parallel reality of our own. This could pertain to a spirit, an alien, or something that can step through a portal, a window area, or what is referred to as a vortex area. Shaman Coyote Chris Sutton believes in the spirit and mystical realms, and his explanation of the energy surrounding forests are just as feasible as any when it comes to the mystery of the Big Muddy Monster. Where standing here right now in what’s an old growth area of the woods and there is energy in these areas that are more energetic than other parts. If you live in a subdivision or something like that it’s not going to be as energetic because you’ve got these old trees. You’ve got all these wonderful brush and things like that and spirits are attracted to that. Elementals are attracted to that energy. The very place we are right now there are small, elemental beings which some would call faeries. But yeah…because I have had experiences with them out here. But these places, they exist all over the place. And so what happens is that entities are attracted to this and this is where they will live but they also sometimes interact with humans. You have instances in North America, all over North America, of people interacting with elemental beings. Sasquatch. Bigfoot, for an example, is known to be very elusive. In the northwest there are sixty different names for sasquatch because there are so many tribes They are all seen as elusive, rarely seen, and not necessarily bad. But seeing him alive is sometimes very concerning because it ties into legends about the changing of the worlds. So it’s not always a great thing to see that. Now in most cases… now there’s always a dichotomy here. Some traditions have him being very nice, mild, don’t bother people. Others, they go as far as to stealing their stuff and taking their children. These legends all vary but they all take on a mystical quality. Because when you’re talking about sasquatch/bigfoot as a flesh and blood entity whereas they see it more times as mystical. They can get in and out of places and just disappear. This area seems to be a hotbed of just odd things in general, like strange phenomenon. It’s kind of clustered around southern Illinois what locals call Little Egypt. Do you think this is what author John Keel would call a window area? Do you think this part of Illinois could fit that category as one of those weird zones where just strange things happen in general whether it’s UFOs or ghosts or monsters in the woods? Well certainly. I travel extensively throughout the Midwest looking for places like that where there’s a conglomeration of anomalous activity. Whether it’s cryptids, anomalous lights in the sky, places where people see spook-lights, or purported haunted locations. I try to go where those are centralized. This area certainly has a preponderance of phenomenon. Yeah a vortex area like Sedona supposedly has all these vortexes but you find them everywhere. Cahokia Mounds, it was a native American settlement back in the 1300 to 1400’s. Huge. Twenty thousand people they think… The native culture, anytime something gets that big, at least in north America, they tend to disperse. It doesn’t work because they don’t have enough materials to keep that many people. Enough food, wood… but if you go there, there are vortexes there. And the places we’re talking about are not cities where there squatches are coming around are not big cities. They’re more rural areas. They’re not going to go into the big cities. These little cities or little towns and areas like this with all these woods and all this energy they’re gonna be more attracted to that. So some people believe that southern Illinois, what they call Little Egypt, is kind of a window area because so much strange things happen between hauntings, spook lights, ufo sightings, bigfoot, do you think there is something unique about this region that sets it apart whether it’s a window area or some people call them vortexes or vortacies? No I don’t, actually. In fact I think anyplace you go want it to be a vortex/window area you can dig up enough stuff if it’s a long enough human habitation. There’s gonna be stories and things like that. Where I used to work in northeastern New Mexico there was also a vortex area. I just don’t think there’s any more of that here than there is anywhere else, personally. Although the vortex theory and bigfoot traveling interdimesionally seem far-fetched, what is fact is that there have been many reports of strange activity in southern Illinois over the past 100 years. But it can also be said that one cannot solve one mystery with another, and trying to do so only leads to deeper rabbit holes. And finally we come to what is perhaps the most bizarre, reported encounter with the Big Muddy Monster. In 1988, what was first thought to be a prowler in a local salvage yard turned into a night of terror for those involved, and one that lead to a second, big cryptid flap in Murphysboro. The salvage yard event became known internationally, as researchers as far away as Russia inquired about the sighting. Armed security, glowing red eyes, an eight foot tall, white, aggressive bigfoot, this encounter has it all and it’s a night that Bob Reiman says that he will never forget. Bob, I’m really excited to talk to you because your story is one of the most bizarre and terrifying encounters I’ve ever heard of. So, take us back 1988. Where did it happen? Describe the area that we're dealing with. Well, I got a phone call about 1:30 in the morning. Usually at the time I… I did towing for the county and Murphysboro police and I figured it was you know a call to pick up a car you know that needed to be taken off the roadway. But instead, it was my security guard Charlie Straub. He told me that that he really believed there was somebody out in the salvage yard and he thought they could have been out there stealing parts from some of the cars or trucks. And I told him I said, “Well, don't do anything I’ll be there and I’ll back you up.” So I drove over there and we both had flashlights. We walked straight down the center of the salvage yard which you had cars on this side and vehicles on this side and had a center row that went right down the middle. We walked it all the way to the end and as we got closer to the end we smell this odor in the air I mean it was raunchy, really bad. I asked him, I said, “That's not a skunk.” I said this I don't know what it is it's almost you know rotten smell. He thought maybe it could have been a dead animal or something like that. So, we walked a little further and then we heard some rustling in the brush. Along my salvage yard there's a fence line and then there's trees and woods and so we tried to see if it was a deer or something like that. As we brought our flashlights around this creature was standing right next to the fence and I mean he looked between eight and ten feet tall, someone there you know, and very broad across the shoulders. I bet three and a half foot, three foot across his shoulders. And he had bright red looking eyes and he let out a scream It started low and then it raised almost like a siren, just real high. And you could feel whenever it screamed it just hit you, the power in the scream. And Charlie said, “You think I ought to shoot it?” He was scared. He already had his pistol pulled. He was the police chief in a small town just a little… right in the area there Murphysboro And I told him, I said, “No, I wouldn't shoot it.” I said, “That that thing probably you'll make it mad and then it’ll really hurt us.” So we just took off with a fast trot back up to where the shop area was and we went inside. Another guy that was there, he worked the radios and stuff from when we got tow calls and stuff, and he asked me, he said, “What's going on down there? I heard a weird sound.” I said, “There's a creature down there. This thing is not happy. We disturbed it.” So I called my wife and told her what happened and she laughed at me and started poking fun at me, and told me I was just tired and I was seeing things. And they showed up and my wife and my mother and my sister and they were teasing us. But they could tell me and my security guard was pretty upset. And it seemed like no sooner than they got there we heard something just right outside the metal building. My building was totally steel metal. I said, “There's something out there and hear it moving around the building.” And about that time we heard a “bang.” I mean it hit the back of the building. You could actually see the indent where it hit on the inside because there wasn't an inner wall on the building. It was just plain tin. They all got scared and started freaking out one another. Immediately, they wanted to leave but I said, “I wouldn't step outside. I would not go outside at all. We go outside and this thing could it might mean it's harm.” So we kind of hung around there and it banged a couple times and made some almost like grunting sounds He did that for I guess 15-20 minutes, maybe. He hung around and then he kind of wandered off and moved away and we thought it was safe to go out so we went out. My mom she got kind of nosey and she was wanting to see what it was and I kept telling her, “ Don't.Don't Let's get out of here." I told everybody… I said, “We all need to get a... get out of here and maybe it’ll move on.” And so that's basically what we did. My mom claimed she saw moving around the cars down in the yard but you know… I don't doubt she saw it. I mean it was big enough it towered above them cars and trucks. And back to the when you and Charlie encountered it. W,.as there any color to it could you see besides the bright red eyes? It was almost like a silvery white tint or kind of silver looking hair. And it was real long. It's probably good six inches in length. And he had kind of a high… I. call it like a dome in the head. And his face was kind of leathery looking and almost humanistic look. But I think the thing that stayed with me for the rest of my life was them eyes. When that light hit his eyes and they were just glowing. There were multiple eyewitnesses that corroborated the salvage yard account and footprint evidence was discovered, but nothing beyond that. After a brief flurry of activity, the Big Muddy Monster retreated once again into the murky waters of folklore, rising only on occasion to frighten residents and monster hunters. The vast swamps, deep canyons, and high bluffs await curious seekers, and perhaps may one day reveal the true nature of Illinois’ most famous river monster, and the people of Murphysboro welcome any who seek adventure along the banks of the Big Muddy River. I would just say that we welcome people to come and I have an open door here. I’ve met with many people over the years about the Muddy Monster and I’d welcome them to kind of stay for a day and see what it's all about and decide for themselves. We're a welcoming community. We're happy to talk about it. There was just a new mural painted downtown that features the Big Muddy Monster. It’s a part of it. There are several things to see here to get a full grasp of what the legend all is all about. I think when we started researching this case we had no idea that it would have the span of sightings or how puzzling and complex and just how bizarre it would turn out to be. I totally agree. Everyone knows about the sightings that were in the mid 70s but we found clearly that it goes way beyond the 70s, both in history and forward in time up until present day. After all the research I’ve done, I feel like the Big Muddy Monster is this idea that magic or dreams or stuff is still out there. That childhood mystery and intrigue… that that's still there. The adventure of going out and exploring it. I think part of its the landscape too. I mean you have the Shawnee National Forest that's 300,000 acres of swamps and woods. I mean when you're walking through that you just have that feeling that anything could be out there. And since we don't have a body that would provide conclusive evidence you know part of me enjoys the idea that 100 years from now people are still going to be camping keeping an eye out listening that the Big Muddy Monster doesn't come up on them. I really hope that these legends will continue on forever, that it only gets weirder and stranger. And maybe we'll find out what it is. We'll prove it or disprove it. But for me, the adventure, the travel, the people we met the witnesses we spoke with, it's not a bad second prize. Definitely.
