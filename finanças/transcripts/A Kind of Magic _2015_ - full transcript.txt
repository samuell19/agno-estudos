♪ Morning, baby. - Hi, Danny. - Hi, Sara. Come on.  Mm-hmm. I'm actually having a Halloween party this weekend. So, we're having a Halloween party? - Hey. - Hey. - Come on. - Bye. It's gonna be a pretty cool Halloween party. - So, yeah, you should come. - Okay. For sure. I will be there. Oh! There's my friend. Is it cool she comes, too? She's a physiatrist, but don't hold it against her. She's totally cool. Sure. No problem. Okay, see you then. - Bye. - Bye. - Hey, man. Sorry I'm late. - Uh, no problem. - Prepping for that board meeting. - Ah, that's today. Sure you don't wanna come back. Your father's even more difficult to deal with - since you left. - I'm not sure I'd be much help there, Bud. Besides, I'm allowed to take a job outside the family business. Somebody should tell that to my mother. What do you mean no to a Halloween party? I've never met anyone who loves Halloween as much as you. It's not a Halloween party. It's an excuse for girls to wear clothes that are too tight and to get drunk. Give me haunted hayrides and eight pounds of candy. What are you, eight? Sara, you have to come to this party. Colin is really great, - and he has a lot of single friends. - Just what I need. A room full of guys who think they have the magic touch with women. No thanks. - Plus, I have a boyfriend. - You have a sort of boyfriend. He doesn't live here, and you guys see each other, like, three times a year. That doesn't make him any less of a boyfriend. Please? Look, we can forget about the guys altogether and have a ladies night out. Come on. I need this. You know how miserable I've been since I lost my job. - Okay. - Yes! I'll go. You know your dad could really up this deal. We could outvote him, but if he's not onboard to expand, it's gonna be a tough road. Well, Tate family is not exactly great with change. Well, you know how well they took my, shall we say, "active independence." - Excuse me. - Just a sec. - ♪ - Pardon me. Oh. Hello. How can I help you? My friend would like an Americano, and I'll have a dark roast. Of course. Anything to eat? I'm good. Do you want anything to eat? - Good. - Nah. Thanks. How much do I owe you? It's on the house. Why, thank you, Anna. May I have your name? Yeah. It's Matt. Matt. Thanks, Matt. Is there anything else I can get for you? How 'bout your number? That's not fair. What? She was ignoring us. So you hijack her brain? Only for a second. I gave it right back. If I had your abilities, I wouldn't do that. - You say that. - I say it 'cause it's true. None of that at my Halloween party. I've got too many normal friends now. What? I love normal. Here you go... Matt. Well, thank you, Anna. Ah, I think this is for you. Thank you, sir. Ever feel rundown? Like you just won't make it through to 5:00? Elixir Of Life Juices has the cure for whatever ails you. We have stress busters, energy boosters and cold killers designed especially to keep you at your best all day long. Well, the commercial is playing well all over town. Our employees say that people mention it three-- for times a day in each of our stores. Now would be an ideal time to move into new neighborhoods. I'm still not sold on buying out Just Juicery. That's six more stores, not one or two. It's a huge financial commitment and a risk. Would you rather control these stores or allow a competitor to step in? Well, they failed. What makes you think we'd do any better? Because our product is better. Jason, Just Juicery has held some of the best real estate in this city for the past 10 years. Considering the traffic in their Broad Street store alone - makes it worth the risk. - I agree. And we'll hit a ceiling if we don't expand. Then why don't we examine the possibility of bottling in retail sales? There are other expenses, Jason. Buying a factory, supplies. Things we've never done before. Not to mention FDA testing and approval. - I did say, "Examine." - Yes, and in a few years. After we have expanded into other cities and states. It might be something to look into. But we're not there yet. Why don't we take a look at those properties and get back to you. Good. We're agreed then. We will consider taking over Just Juicery. And that concludes today's meeting. Thank you very much. Thanks for the backup, Lizzy. Of course. You know I always do what's best for the company. Hello, Mother. They burned the beans at that coffee shop of yours. You know, it makes the coffee bitter. Yeah, well, I don't go there for the coffee. I'm guessing this isn't about work or you would have been at the board meeting. As a matter of fact, why weren't you there? Oh, I knew you could handle things. - How did Jason react to the plan? - Not well. He's determined to block the expansion. - I think he feels cornered. - Well then, this isn't gonna make things easier. Oh, no. No, I'm not discussing Lizzy Paris. She's smart. She's fun, attractive. She comes from a great family, and you and Lizzy have been thick as thieves since birth. It's not Lizzy you're interested in. It's the Paris family. I get it. You and Maggie have wanted us together since puberty. But it's not gonna happen, Mom. I like Lizzy just not that way. Matt, think of the business. Our coven, three families working together... It's a fragile balance and one that the council wasn't too happy with. So we need to appear as a united force. Well then, why not pair up Colin and Lizzy? They're far more suited for one another? Colin is a lovely person. No one is saying he's not. But he doesn't have any abilities-- none. How does that help the Paris family? Or the company in the long run? Mom, that's awful. That's life. We have to think about the future. No, Mother, no. I'm not dating Lizzy. You're right. You're not. You're marrying her. I'm sorry, sweetheart. This is bigger than Elixir. It's bigger than you. The entire council is in agreement. You're 35. We can't wait any longer for you to make your own match. You say that like you've approved of anyone I've ever dated. Well, maybe I'd approve if you ever dated anyone inside the council. There, what, 12 families in the council? Kind of a limited dating pool, Mom. But that doesn't change the fact that you turn 36 in a few months and you know the rules. Within your 35th year if not married to a witch, you lose your powers. Yada, yada, yada. Okay, what if I find the love of my life before then? Oh, Matt. You would never survive without your particular gifts. How long do I have? Till the 31st. Halloween. One week? Speak with Lizzy. Move forward with the council's decision and I promise I won't argue if you two don't want a traditional ceremony. A witch council traditional or a traditional traditional? Either way. Lizzy will meet you at the house. I'm sorry I'm not very exciting. You must have lots of interesting clients. You're fixating again, Dennis. People say all sorts of things when they're upset, especially in a divorce. Why are you so focused on this one? Because I can see it on everyone's face when I talk. Even my friends don't think I'm interesting. And it's only getting worse. Here in your office is the only place I feel... appreciated. Listened to. And I'm paying you to listen. Well, maybe you feel comfortable because you're being honest about your feelings. Have you tried expressing yourself to your friends? Oh, yes, so they can come right out and tell me how not exciting I am? You're projecting again, Dennis. You need to find a way to move on and allow yourself to be happy. Don't you think it's been long enough? It's only been seven years, Dr. Cain. I don't think I'm nearly ready. My family's crest is green, but if you prefers yours, we can, you know... Either way is fine. I think we should incorporate both. I think our parents would appreciate it, and I think gold and green would look lovely together. Symbolizing life and prosperity. Ugh. It's starting to get cold out here at night I think we should bring in some heaters. How many members of the council did your Mother say are coming? 60, no more than 70. I don't think that should be a problem at all. Lizzy. I know. You don't want to marry me. You're saying you want to marry me? It's not as though I'm gonna meet some young eligible warlock at a bar. I've chosen this life and there are certain... realities to it. It sounds so romantic. Mmm, we're good friends, right? And we have a good time together. Of course, but... this isn't when we make it magically snow in July. Or rearrange letters on the theatre marquee. Isn't it though? Life is an adventure, Matt. I know we're not in love with each other, but we love each other in a different way. It's not the same. Look, I don't know what's gonna happen, but I know that we're gonna have a good life and a good time together. And-- and we like the same things. And-- and I know that you're gonna treat me well. And you know that I'm not gonna turn into some overbearing weirdo. And we get to keep our powers. And that's all we could really hope for, right? Imagine if we were normal, like Colin. You think it's easy for him? A magical family with no magic? Knowing that one day if he brings home a nice normal girl to one of those powerful witch families on this side of the country. How long do you think that's gonna last? How many of your boyfriends memories have your parents wiped? Ah... I think I lost count by the time I got to college. Me, too. See, Colin's not better off. How are things going? They're going. Do you have a minute to talk about the food? I have all the time in the world. ♪ Oh, um... Thanks, but maybe later, huh? I'm gonna have to learn to start saying no to these offers. I can't believe you're upset about marrying Lizzy Paris. An arranged marriage to help me keep my magic. I think I'm doing just fine on my own. Yeah, right. Says a guy whose greatest skill is whisking any girl off her feet at the touch of an elbow. Good point. I wonder if there's a spell to help me stop doing that? Colin, where's my drink? I have no idea. I stopped reading the spell book at 10. I have to deliver these drinks. Drink up, witches! Uh, please? Just a little while longer? This guy is really amazing, Sara. I can tell that there's something there. Fine. Of-- yes. - Thank you. - Okay. Mmm. Excuse me. Oh, thank God. Silence. Oh. Hey, hope I'm not interrupting. No, no, not at all. You don't like parties? No, I like, um, birthday parties, dinner parties, barbeques... Not music vibrating up your legs parties. - Well, why are you here? - My friend. She, um-- she dragged me out for a girls night and now she's in there with some... random guy. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm Sara. Matt. Why are you touching my elbow? You just had a bug on there or something. - Got it off. - Oh. - You're good. - Thanks. Thank you. Maybe you'd like some M&M's, huh? Hmm. Thanks. I already got some. Oh. So, you're a witch, huh? Wow. You're quick. What gave it away? Let me guess. You're a caster. Do you have any other abilities? Oh, um-- flight. I can fly. Wow. That's a rare one. Not in my family it's not. I can't believe we haven't met before. Well, maybe you haven't been running around with the right kind of witches. - Apparently. - Fair warning. Don't try and use any of your magic charm on me. It's not gonna work. Clearly. No, I... - I have a boyfriend. - Oh. Well, I... have a something as well. Mmm. Lady problems. You know... I've been told I'm a-- I'm a really good listener. - Is that so? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. And apparently, I'm gonna be here for a few hours. Okay. What do you say we get a bottle of wine, couple of glasses and you and I we-- we'll talk this thing out? You get the wine. I'll get the blankets. - Done. - Done. ♪ The witching hour ♪ So, tell me about this mystery woman. Is she some mad sorceress you have no control over? Oh, you know a lot of mad sorceress's, do you? Too many. And none nearly as skilled or powerful as they think. No, she's not mad. There's nothing wrong with her, actually. Hmm. But she's not the one. I don't know if I believe in "the one." It doesn't much matter in this case. Our families our close and, um... Well, they expect us to get married... Next week. Wow. An arranged marriage. You do know you're your own person. You can say no. Well, there're bigger issues at hand. Our families run a business together. - Elixir Life Juices. - Yeah, I've been there. You guys make great smoothies. I swear, every time I get sick I go in and get one of your health boosters, and I wake up the next morning feeling amazing. Like magic, huh? So you are really marrying a woman just to keep a juice business together? You can't just be... I don't know, good friends? Well, it's tradition. The council insists. Oh, right. Yes. The council. Right. What about you? Where's your boyfriend, huh? Mmm. Um... Alex doesn't live here. He's in Geneva right now. As in Lake Geneva? As in Switzerland. He's a physicist. He's spending two years at the Large Hadron Collider. Physicist, huh? Suddenly I feel so inadequate. Don't. I don't understand half of what he says. Two years is a long time to spend apart. Yeah, I mean... Well, he comes home a couple times a year, and we call. He's changing the face of science. So, how can I possibly complain? Yeah. You ever get lonely? Yeah. Sometimes. But, hey. All couples have ups and downs, right? Right. Yeah. Yeah. - More wine? - Absolutely. Bye. Great party. Ah. Well, your dad sounds like he's an amazing man. When did he pass? I was pretty young. The cyclone. A freak weather accident. Until then, I thought my father was invincible. When he died, I realized that... I-- he was just um... Mortal. Yeah, I guess. But my mom took over for the both of them and here I am. How 'bout some more wine, huh? Oh, boy. We, uh... We really did some damage here. Oh. - That's the rest? - That's it. That's all there is. Wow. Look at us. Impressive. Mmm. To your mom. I will drink to that. Hmm. Oh. It's morning. We talked all night. That cannot be right. It's 7:00 a.m. I got to go to work. I got to go take a show-- I have a patient at 8:00 a.m. I cannot believe this. I have to go to work. A patient? What? You can fly and you're a doctor? Yes, well-- well, I believed my grandmother when she first told me that I could fly, I quickly figured out that I couldn't at nine when I jumped off the top of a jungle gym. Two broken ankles and a collar bone later, I figured I needed a-- a backup plan. So, um... You're not really a witch, huh? Alas, no. Wouldn't that be so much fun? There's something very wrong with this moment. I know. Normally we would exchange numbers and... go get drinks. But you are getting married. And your boyfriend is in Switzerland saving the world. I still want to see you again. That's wrong, isn't it? No. But... Mmm. Let's not ruin this night. Let's keep it just the way it is. One perfect night. How're we supposed to do that? Um... We're gonna say good-bye, and we're gonna hug. I hate it. - But you're right. - Mm-hmm.  It was, um... It was great to meet you, Matt. You too, Sara. Wait. Let me get you a ride home here. Your friend had to leave hours ago. Oh, no. I'm just going to, um, you know fly home on my broomstick. Of course. I'll be fine. No awkward second good-byes. Are you sure? I don't think... Oh, my. 12 minutes... 19 minutes... 36 minutes? If only I could just... snap my fingers! And the taxi... arrive. That was lucky. Hey! Hi. Thank you for stopping. Ooh. Oh, hey. Hey. Oh, don't tell me you've been out back the whole night with that girl. Oh, nothing happened. Basically nothing. I am exhausted though. Can I crash for a few hours? Look, you know I love you like a brother but if you ever disappear with a strange girl after you marry Lizzy... Come on, man. I won't do that. All right, it's all yours. You wanna know something weird? Uh... probably not. This girl... my charm didn't work on her at all. She sat outside with you all night. In 50 degree weather, I'm pretty sure she was charmed. No. No, she wasn't. I think she liked me. Like the real me. Weird, huh? Ahh. I forgot what that felt like. Anyhow... good night, bro. Yeah, night. Hey, would you do me a favor? Why don't you use some of your mad skills to clean this place when you wake up? Yeah. You betcha. What is the emergency? You should've seen this woman, Dr Cain. She looked right through me... It's like I was invisible. You're projecting. Perhaps she didn't even see you walk up to her. But no, in this case I tapped her on the shoulder. And then I waited for her to turn-- Dennis? What's wrong? Your-- Your pen... Your pen floated... on its own. I'm sorry, what? The pen... I don't know. You-- you let it go. But then it-- it floated... on it's own. Dennis... Pens don't float. But I saw it. I was looking right at it. Okay... Ahem. Have you seen anything else... odd, recently. Other objects moving on their own? Or people talking to you... that maybe no one else sees? Dr. Cain, I'm not hallucinating. Your pen floated. I swear, I've never seen anything like it before. Sometimes... in moments of extreme stress... I wasn't stressed before, but I'm definitely stressed now. Wonderful. So am I right or is your dad? Both right. Elixir has the money to acquire Just Juicery. But you would need at least three of the new stores in order to make money in the first year. They're existing juice stores, how hard can it be? It's not like we're reinventing the wheel. Yeah, but Just Juicery is exiting the market. And I don't think it's because they're tired of mixing kale and spinach all day. That's what your dad said. You wanna look at their books? No, I don't wanna look at their books. I don't work at Elixir anymore. I got my own job. You hired a new accountant. Use him. Have you met Craig? He's the idiot nephew of one of the council members that Ben wanted to hire. He can't even add. I still don't know why you left the business in the first place. I left because I've spent the last 20 years in a magical world with no magic. And a father who's pretty ... about it. I just needed to feel normal somewhere, anywhere. How's that working out for you? Look, talk to Craig. And just try not to alienate my father. He doesn't take too well to being kept out of the loop. And if you get Just Juicery to give you their books, I will take a look at them. Thank you my friend, I appreciate that. Hey... there's one other thing that I need to ask. No, I will not balance your checkbook, Matt. Manage your own finances. Actually... with the wedding coming up... I'm gonna need a best man. Oh. Uh, yeah. Yeah, of course I will. And I will hunt you down if you try to run away. You're still thinking about that girl, aren't you? It's hard not to. She's pretty great. Yeah, but pretty great for you is what, two dates? Maybe three? You're just stuck on her because you can't have her. Probably right. You okay? Yeah, probably just tired. All the locations passed inspection. Oh, fantastic. I'll call the lawyer and we'll investigate what kind of offer they're looking for. Oh, boy. It's just a step, it's not a decision, Jason. Nobody's going behind anyone else's back. We know that. Don't we, hon? And I hate to rush in, but I've got Maggie in the back waiting to start the planning. Oh, of course. Go. I know you're upset about the sale, dear. It's not just the expansion. We started this business together, the three families. And now with Matt marrying Lizzy, and Colin out of the company altogether. We're handing over all our power. Jason, you can't believe that. You mean, you can't. Mark my words we're hanging the keys to the kingdom. And all because we have the one kid who can't cast the simplest of spells. You've always been amazing with decor. Thank you. And believe me, Lizzy has inherited my talent. She put together a romantic anniversary dinner for Ben and Me. Straight out of the pages of a magazine. And to have the wedding in your beautiful home. Abby, it's gonna be a stunner. We're doing the right thing here, aren't we? Putting Matt and Lizzy together? Of course we are. Lizzy may be only 33, but Matt's just got a couple of more months before he's 36 and loses everything. Are we really sure that would happen. We've never actually seen someone's abilities fade at 36. For all we know that's an old wives' tale. That's because we've never allowed anyone to remain unmarried. In our day there was so many more families. Remember? The Roches, the Banantis, the Zevons... There must have been 20 of them. But so many of the kids that we grew up with decided to leave the life. Matt and Lizzy just don't have the pool that we had. Such a shame. I never felt pressured to marry Glenn. Not once. We're their parents, Abby. We know what's best for them. And I'm sure this is exactly what Glenn would have wanted. Let's face it, council wasn't thrilled. When three families splintered off. Started Elixir of Life. But we're helping people with our abilities, in the only legitimate, hush-hush, way that we can. But Matty and Lizzy together... an approved match. Two of the most powerful witch families. It's going to ensure that our powers continue, generations to come. And that Elixir of Life is going to thrive for years. I understand why, I do. I just-- I don't want Matt to think that I'm choosing the council or the company over him. You're not. He knows that. But Abby, we are in very real danger of losing the council altogether over the next few generations. That's why we need Matt and Lizzy and their children. You just want little grand-wiccans. Maybe. So do you. Of course. Good. Let's get this show on the road. I hear Colin's party was fun. Yeah. I don't have the tolerance for all-nighters like I used to. What were you doing up all night? Honestly, I was talking to this girl all night. Nothing happened, I promise. Well, I appreciate your honesty, but we are getting married on Halloween night. And I've been pulling my weight and I just... really appreciate it if you took this seriously. I will. Really? I mean, have you thought about the fact that we're going to have to have kids? Well we have an elixir for that. No, you're right. Okay, I'm sorry. Apology accepted. And... why don't you try one of our new energy boosters. Clearly you need it. Even more than I thought. Well, looks like you'll be buying a new blender this afternoon. Huh. Uh, I don't even know why I keep going on these interviews. I mean I almost never hear back. Or when I do, it's to tell me that I'm overqualified or they decided to go another way. You will get a job, I promise you. The waiting is the hard part. Says you. You're practically bursting at the seams with new patients. Thanks. So why do you look so distracted? I shouldn't say. Okay, if it's that patient-doctor nonsense, just make up a name and say it's a hypothetical. - Okay. - Mm-hmm. Yesterday, a patient... - a hypothetical... - Yeah. Patient... May have said he saw my pen float. So he's crazy. Except that totally made up hypothetical patient has never hallucinated before. So what, your pen was actually floating? Come on, seriously. The guy is clearly a nutter. Oh, do you have any more sugar? It's the only vice I can still afford. Mmm. Yeah, I'm sure I'm overreacting. It's just-- It's so... it's so weird. Did I ever tell you about the position over at Object Power, the one with full bennies and the super generous vacation days? Yeah, I think so. Or how about the one at the start-up over on 11th St. With the barbecue on their balcony. I love you so much, but I wish you would disappear for just like 30 seconds. Just like 30 seconds of silence. Yeah... I'm sure I can. But I don't know how much help I would be. We didn't exactly part on the best terms... Lacy? Lacy? Lacy? Are you in the bathroom? Where is she? Where'd she go? Lacy? Lacy? Lacy! I know that you haven't talked in a while, but he would seem like a really nice guy. What was his name? Tommy? Terry? Tyler. Okay. Fine. You don't have to call him. Great. I'll have Kurter come over this afternoon. Thank you. Why wasn't I informed about you asking to see Just Juicery's financial records. I was planning to send a memo around this afternoon. Oh, so now it's a done deal? No one said that, Jason. I just thought it would be helpful to make an informed decision. It was actually Colin's idea. Leave my son out of this. He chose to leave us, so his opinion means nothing to me. Then again, maybe he's got the right idea. Maybe the whole Tate family should branch off. Is this because no one was on board with your idea of bottling? Do you want to explain to the FDA how we can cure a cold in three hours? I sure don't. To them, it'll just look like a recipe. Okay? They don't need to know it's a spell. I don't understand what your problem is. This is a good proposition. My problem is you and your mother have connived to form the perfect powerhouse with the Paris'. Trying to get the upper hand in the company and kick us out. I see what's going on here. That is not true. My mother would never be so calculating. Really? Prove it to me. Tell her, "no." Put a stop to this expansion. And put a stop to your wedding. I will do no such thing. Well if that's the way you're gonna handle things, we're done talking. Watch out, boy. I've got powers you can't even begin to imagine. This is ridiculous. Clearly, I'm exhausted. Do I tell Alex about Matt? Was Matt even anything at all? I did kiss him. And I did like it. Yeah, let's run this test once more. And then we can head home for the day. Sara. Hey, is everything all right? Yeah... I mean... I think so. Um. Why are you calling me? I'm still at work. No, I-- I didn't call you, Alex. You just... you just popped up. On my computer. I was thinking about you and then suddenly... there you were. Sweetie, it doesn't work like that. Maybe you accidentally hit a button. No, I didn't touch the thing, Alex. My hands were actually no where near the keyboard. I mean, it doesn't matter. It was an accident. Whatever. Um... I can tell you're having a rough day. So... why don't you call me back in a couple of hours and we'll talk about it? Well, I have patients until 7:00 p.m. That's 1:00 a.m. your time. Tomorrow morning then. Tomorrow morning. Okay, I love you-- What is going on? The Denisovs know they're making dinner for 63 people... Lila and Freddie Wayne are going to be out of town for the event. They are thinking about a more traditional menu, but I want to make sure you kids are okay with that. I'm all for tradition, but... no one is eating eye of newt soup at our wedding. That recipe has been in my family since the 1700s. It also has eyes in it. You don't actually eat the eyes, it just makes the broth taste delicious. I think we're fine... scrapping it altogether. After all, you don't want the Denisovs scrambling to find 63 newts at this stage of the game, now do we? Fine. Lizzy, Matt. Of course, this is your special day. What would you like? Nice pumpkin bisque, perhaps? Fine. So that's a "no" on the pumpkin bisque. Maggie, why don't we go through the guest list? Give the children a moment. I-- You know. Mom, we need to talk. Matt, I know you're not thrilled about the situation, but the wedding is in three days. That incident at the table wasn't my first problem. Oh, that. Anxiety. Happens to the best of us. When you have you're first baby, you'll accidentally send things into walls. Just don't do it in public. That was a mess we had to clean up years ago. Lot of memories to wipe. Yeah, I think it's more than that. Jason came to see me this morning. He accused you of conniving with the Paris' to get more power. I exploded the display in my office. And I sent cups flying everywhere. You know, there are rules about violence. It's not acceptable, in any capacity. If he calls the council, you could be brought up on charges. What if he's the one doing this? - What do you mean? - Think about it. He's against the marriage, feels like he's being pushed out of the business. Now my magic is a mess. I can't lift anything, I can't move anything. I'm starting tornados in the backyard. You think Jason Tate hexed you? Our families have been friends for generations. His son is your best friend. What other explanation is there? Could it be your age? Maybe your magic is waning the closer you get to your 36th birthday. And, Matt, that is why I want you to get married on Halloween. Thanks, Mom. You don't need to remind me. But, no. Okay, that is not it. This is more serious. If you've been hexed, there are ways to find out. Great. What if Jason is behind this? Then we go to the council. But first thing's first. We don't make any accusations until we have proof. There has be a logical explanation for this. Or... I'm crazy. This is ridiculous. This is ridiculous, what am I doing? Okay. One more time. Ahem. Concentrate. Is there anything I can do to help? Given your problems, I think it's best if you don't touch the potion. Good point. - Oh, dear. - What? You're not being hexed, but your powers are being siphoned off somehow. You're not in full control, which is why you keep having mishaps. Could Jason transfer my abilities to Colin? I know it sounds crazy. Mmm, not so crazy, but that would take a lot of dark magic, and you can't hide dark magic. This is quite the opposite. If you had fallen in love with a mortal, you would have told me, right? What? Love can sometimes cause accidental transference. I've never seen a case this extreme and, well, it's pretty rare occurrence anyway, so I don't imagine it would have happened to you. Well, there was this girl. Matthew, you're getting married. Mother, nothing happened. Okay, I kissed her, but I don't love her. We have to find her. Well, that's gonna be a problem. I don't really know her. She was just a guest at Colin's party. Well, then we have to ask Colin. For once I'm glad he and his father don't speak. I'm sure that Jason would relish the opportunity to tell this to the council. ♪ I'm crazy, crazy, crazy ♪ And losing my mind ♪ Played a game of hide and seek ♪ ♪ My bestie I did find ♪ Things floating everywhere ♪ ♪ Some over here, some over there ♪ ♪ It seems for all the world to see ♪ ♪ I have magic left to spare. ♪ I'm hungry. Cookies. I want cook-- Oh, my God. Oh, my God, no. Make it stop. I don't wanna be crazy anymore. Oh, no. Where's the...? Where's my phone? Hey. I just had to call you. I was really worried that you were mad at me. I'm sorry that I keep talking about the jobs. Oh, no. No, no, no. It's, um... It's okay. Yeah, uh, I know it can be frustrating, but you just, um... you just gotta-- you gotta hang in there. Okay? You don't sound so good yourself. You were trying to tell me this, weren't you? I was being a terrible and selfish friend. Are-- are you finally ready to end things with Alex? Is that what's going on? No, no, no, no. I'm just, um... I'm a little out of sorts. Well, do you want me to come over? We could have a sleepover and watch some terrible '90s movies and eat some raw cookie dough. No! No, no, no, no! No-- not tonight. Just, um... No. Soon. I think, um... I think it's best that I just have some tea. That's okay. I mean, I really don't have the extra money to spend on groceries anyways. My interview today was awful. You know what? I'm-- I'm sure you're wrong. I'm sure they're gonna call you back, and they're gonna offer you more money than you could have ever imagined. They're gonna be throwing money at you. Oh. Weird. Sara? That's the company from today. I gotta take this. Okay. Bye. So that's what was happening with the coffee cup. You're losing your abilities. Sure does seem that way. And the council can't help? - The families? - We can't go to them. You of all people know how they react when one of us loses our magic. Right. So, why did you come to me? I'm as magical as a fruit fly. Mother thinks it has something to do with the girl at your party. The girl, huh? I know. I'm a terrible person. But, you said she was mortal. How could she be taking your magic? Hopefully it was an accident. Really powerful love can sometimes... I don't love her! I don't even know her. Which is why we're here. Do you know her? Because we really need to find her. And if she's running around town spouting off Matt's magic, she could really hurt herself or somebody else. I don't know her. I mean, I saw her briefly when she left with Matt to go outside, but I didn't recognize her. Matt, what did you say her name was? Sara. Does she have a last name? Probably. I just don't know it. What does she do? Doctor, nurse or something. She said she had patients. You talked to her for seven hours, and you don't know her last name or what she does for a living? What did you talk about? Our lives. Our families. Not as witches, as people. I told her about the juice business. She talked about her grandmother. She did come with a friend. And the friends name was...? No idea. The friend ditched her for some guy and, well, Sara didn't want to talk about her. Fabulous. Oh, she's got a boyfriend. What is wrong with you people? Is anybody faithful anymore? His name's Alex and he's working in Switzerland for a couple years at the Large Hadron Collider. That's something. I mean, there can't be that many people named Alex that work there. All right. Oh, man. Okay. Okay. This isn't going away. Which means... I have to learn to control it. Hmm. Well, I may be out of my mind, but at least it's a useful kind of crazy. You're kidding me? There's nobody named Alex there? Not in the directory. - I'm doomed. - Wait. Wasn't there a spell that traces magic? If she accidentally latched onto your magic here, couldn't we use the spell to follow it? Blood hound. Not the most reliable spell, but, yeah, we could try it. I'll need a few things I don't normally keep around the house and, uh, it'll take a couple hours. Okay, great. I'll go with you. We'll meet you after work. Are you crazy? I can't go in the office. I can cause the place to spontaneously combust. You have to. You're investigating a major expansion. I mean, if you don't show up, you're just gonna give my father more ammunition against you. I suggest you just keep your head focused and try to spend a day without using magic at all. Oh, easy for you to say. Colin's right, honey. We'll go as fast as we can. Hi, Danny. Go, go, go, go! Okay. Oh, right. You can do this. It is just a coffee shop. Right? It's just a coffee shop. Hi. Medium latte. Excuse me. I... Excuse me. Hello. Can I help you? Um... Medium latte. Of course. $3.50 May I have your name please? Sara. Thanks. "Sara." Have a great afternoon. Do you think this will work? Oh, I hope so. 'Cause if not, I am out of ideas. Hmm. Hey. Do you have a few minutes to talk? Of course. Great. Okay, um, listen, about last night. No, I'm so sorry. I-- I know that display must have been upsetting. You know, things have been crazy around here and I just... Don't want to get married. No. No, I'm happy to do whatever we need to. Happy? You unleashed a hurricane at your mother's table over an appetizer for the reception. That's not happy, Matt. Our families need us, right? Our kind keep leaving the council and more kids are being born without magic. We're not free to just be with whomever we want. Is this about the girl at Colin's party? - No. - Mmm. No. Listen. I'm not crazy enough to think that she's my soul mate, but... Yet, we did have a genuine honest connection. I know. We're, uh-- we're just friends. I mean, we're practically... siblings. I don't know how to get around that. Do you? You know what's funny? Growing up I always thought I'd marry Colin and you would be the godfather to our kids. And even in high school when he realized that he didn't have powers I thought, he just needs to find his own magic and maybe I could be the one to help him. Because you love him. You have to tell him, Lizzy. Yeah. I know. God, could you imagine both of us ending up with non-magic? The council would throw a fit. Yes, they would. Would it be so bad if we just, I don't know, refused? I'm sorry. Did Miss Lizzy Paris just suggest - we rebel against our parents? - Mm-hmm. I never thought I'd see the day. I mean, even if it is a possibility, I'm really not sure how to go about it. Because 63 people are gonna be showing up at your mother's house expecting a wedding. Well, you say that like they weren't gonna throw a Halloween party anyhow. This year it'll just be more grand than the years past. We do have to concede the possibility that the council will kick us out. It's their right. Or we'll end up 36 and powerless. Could you imagine what that would be like? Yeah, I think I can. I mean, I think I could live a normal, non-magical life, but, you... just love your powers. I mean, do you even know how to open a door? Lizzy, um... I think I need to tell you something. I've never seen this spell before. What will it do? This silt will create a route or routes to show us where the magic has traveled, I hope. This was more Matt's father's area of expertise. But this situation has me doing all sorts of rare magic lately. It seems Matt's magic is siphoning off faster than I imagined. Sara must be pulling it off him and leaving a little bit behind wherever she goes. From what I can tell, soon he might not have any left at all. She asked, "Would you like to go out?" I said, "Yeah, sure." But she was pointing at the door and she meant that I should go out before her... Dennis, I want you to listen to me carefully. It is time to stop blaming yourself for the end of your marriage. These things happen. You and Arianna didn't work out. And it wasn't because you're a terrible person. And it's not because she's a terrible person. You must didn't work together. Do you understand? Yes. Good. That's good. Now let's talk about your next step. I'd like that. Matt! - We said we would... - No. Let's stop pretending Lizzy wasn't gonna find out. Wedding vows require casting. Which I can't exactly do right now. I'm not mad, Abby. I'm just here to help. Okay. Come inside. Uh... Hey. Hi. - Well... - Well, yeah. I think I'm gonna go inside. Hey. I think Lizzy likes you. What? - Really? - Yeah. So, you've heard of this happening before? Not for a long time. And I can't find a specific reference to it. So we have to go straight to the source. I just hope that great grandmother isn't upset about being disturbed. Great-grandmother, it's Abigail. We need your help. I should say so. There is all kinds of trouble in this room. That would be me. I kissed a mortal, and it seems that my powers are transferring to her. It must be a great love then. I don't even know her. Dear boy. Have you never heard of love at first sight? Heard of, yes. Believe in, no. This has happened before then? Only a handful of times that I know of. And not for a hundred years. Very rare. Exceedingly rare. But then, true love always is. I said I don't love her. I don't even know her. We understand you don't think you're in love, but you're not the most self-aware person. Maybe you don't recognize it because you've never seen it before. Okay. What do I do? You must find her. If it was a mistake, you can call your powers back to you. But if it is indeed true love, then you both must accept it and allow it into your worlds risking everything. Magic has been my whole life. I don't know what I'd do without it. Don't worry about limits. Just focus on your true feelings and it will come. Great-grandmother. We've tried looking for her. We don't know where else to look. Go find the one who is wise in the way of people. We can't tell the council. Not the council, Matthew. Find the mortal who advises other mortals. The shrink. Dear, the psychiatrist. Oh. Find the psychiatrist as soon as you can. She wants you to see a psychiatrist? Because it's so easy to find a good one on short notice. See a shrink? That's the advice? Thanks, but no thanks. Maybe it would help you to speak to someone. My friend Lacy knows someone. Someone who was at my party. Someone who disappeared halfway through the party. - Sara. - Yeah. Hey, Lacy? Yeah, it's Colin. Yeah, yeah, good. Listen. Did you say you have a friend who was a psychiatrist? Yes, Sara. Look. I need to make an appointment with her for my friend. - Mom, I'm so sorry. - No, it really is for a friend. I know how much you wanted a wedding. Oh, all I ever wanted was for you to be happy. Maybe this is the end of your magic. Maybe not. But the world changes, Matt, and I guess we just have to learn to change with it. )� Okay. Lacy will get you an appointment for this afternoon. I had to embellish a little, tell her you were totally crazy. Oh, well, thanks. Wait. This afternoon? We have the board meeting about the acquisition. We got it covered, Matt. In fact, Colin is going to come with me to the office to explain things to his dad. - I am? - He is? You are. Sure. Happy to help. Um, I have an opening today at three. What's his name? Uh, Michael-- Matthew... He's seriously cra-cra. Okay, no problem. Just, uh, give him the address. Are you available tonight? Still in the mood for some raw cookie dough? I'm about to do something drastic and I'm meeting a friend. Who? Drastic? What is it? I'll tell you about it later. - I'm there.  - Okay. Bye. Hey, babe, what's up? Is this important? Yes, Alex. We need to talk. Really, Abby? You get my own son to go against me and then Matt doesn't even have the nerve to be here for this vote. Matt's under the weather, Jason, and you know exactly how he'd vote. You know what, I'm nobody's pawn, Dad. I've looked through their books and this is a good investment. Well, I got a memo from Craig this morning saying it could go either way! He's wrong. Look. I see great potential here. Worse case as far as I can tell is breaking even, and I think it's gonna be far better than that. Now, I'm not siding with Jason, but tell me. How can we succeed when Just Juicery failed? The same way we've succeeded in our own business. Their budgets are sloppy and wasteful. We're not. Well, I for one am ready to vote "Yes." You said, "We." Does that mean you're officially coming back? I may have been a little hasty running out on the family business. What is it? What's wrong with you? - You know who he reminds me of. - Why-- why do you... Hi. Hi. Sugar, um... Okay. You make tea for all your patients? Here are the ground rules. You can tell me anything. This is a safe space. No judgment. Isn't it your job to judge? Evaluate. Not judge. Ugh! Ah! Let me take that. Do you need me to wipe...? No-- um... Hot. Okay. Yeah, here. Give it to me. Oh, I know it's hot. It's definitely, um... It's very hot. Um, I'll just clean it off. Um, you know, it's clean. It looks totally, totally clean. Hah! Thank you. I'm guessing you've had a, uh, interesting couple days. I don't know what you're talking about. You said this is a safe space, right? Mm-hmm. That, uh, magic, your magic? It's mine. Well, at least it used to be. Your magic. You have magical powers. What are you-- what are you, like a-- like a witch? A warlock, actually. Yeah. With magical powers. Till I kissed you. And now, I can't seem to do anything. So, smoothies. They really do cure colds. Among other things. This is so weird. Why me? It's complicated. Does your fiancée know? I mean, maybe she can give you some of her magic. We're not supposed to be able to transfer abilities. It's very rare. And, I don't have a fiancée anymore. I don't have an Alex... anymore. So I-- I can't just touch you and-- and give you your magic back? Because I would. I would give it... No, I would love for you to touch me, but I'm-- I'm kind of afraid. - Yeah, I get it. - Yeah. So what do we do? I know this is gonna sound strange... coming from a grown man. But I think we should call my mother. Matt? Yes, of course, sweetheart. I'll be right there. What's wrong? Uh, Matt's bringing Sara to the house. - Oh. - Do you need help? I think it's best to limit exposure to the girl, at least for the moment. Well, call me as soon as you can. Well, I think we should go to my office. I could use a little support talking to my parents. Oh, hi. Come on in. - Hello. - Hey, darling. Hi, Mom. Dad. - Yes... - Is something the matter? Oh... well... I think... You should have a drink. Is this about the wedding? There isn't going to be a wedding. Ahem. What? - Well... - Well... Not... this Saturday. Or to... Matt Andover. So... Okay, so we're just gonna go. - Should probably have this one as well... - Yep. Yeah? What is your mom doing? It's a protection spell. This might work better if we were all focused and not flirting. - Sorry. - Yeah, sorry. Okay. Hopefully we don't blow up the house... What? I want you to both raise one hand. Now very gently... Press your hands together. Are you all right? Anybody in pain? I'm good. I'm perfect. I don't remember saying to kiss. Try to use your powers, Matt. Oh, thank God. Here, I want you try something. What? - Here. - I thought... I returned your powers to you. I just have a feeling... Go on, take it. Oh! Sorry. H How is this possible? You're an aorist. You gain the powers of those closest to you. It's very rare magic. You have your own magic now. Will it go away? I don't think so. Should be easy to control now. Thank goodness for that. I've already broken almost every dish I own. That makes two of us. If you were getting married this weekend, we could have a whole new set of dishes. This is better. It's gonna take some getting used to, being able to move things around. - So crazy. - It's much more than that. You can change moods, sometimes the weather. You can even read people's minds. Mmm, I don't know that I want to read people's minds. Well, you say that now... It is discouraged, though. So... what happens next with us? Anything we want. - Okay. - Oh, come on now keep it G-rated, guys. Oh, God, sorry. Lizzy. Colin. So not sorry. And this is Sara. It's really nice to meet you. I've gotta ask... on a normal people scale... what kind of holiday is Halloween to you? Is it like Christmas? - Or Easter? - Fourth of July. - Oh. - Me, it's Thanksgiving. - Yeah... - Fireworks and 17 courses of food. Well... that's my ideal holiday. Our generation is still working out the menu. Well, at least we have candy corn. Well, and eyeballs in our soup. Eww! Trick or treat! What if the council doesn't like me? What if they erase my memory? They're going to love you. It would be irresponsible to erase your memory. With your new powers you could wake up tomorrow and accidentally blow something up. I'm being serious. Your family can trace it's lineage back before the Mayflower. My family is like from... everywhere you can possibly be from. You have more power than most of these witches here. You'll be great. Come on. Oh, hi. I mean, I just hope... now that I've rejoined the company. I hope that you can be a little less combative with the Andovers. You know they just want what's best for the company. Just like everybody else. It wasn't about the Andovers or the expansion. I was just feeling like I just lost you and now I might be losing the company, too. Dad, you're not losing anything. - I'm... I'm right here. - I know. And now that you're marrying Lizzy Paris, we'll have a majority vote. - Dad, stop it. - I know. What? I'm kidding. Can't tell you how happy we are that you two are together. - Lizzy. - Me too. Me three. Um... cheers! Cheers indeed. You need meet my future daughter-in-law. Oh well, they're not engaged yet. But it's... it's any day now. I don't wanna. She's an aorist. Did you hear that? I've never actually met one. You think she'd be willing to join the council? I can't imagine why not. - If you don't mind... - Yeah. - Excuse us. - It's so nice to meet you. Hi. Okay. - Let's dance. - Yeah. Do you think they liked me? Yes, they loved you. I still don't know how to explain all of this, I mean, literally. It's not like I can tell people. Well, you're gonna get used to it. When it comes to your family, we'll just... be careful with our abilities. Now when it comes to kids, they have a tougher time learning about their powers. Kids, huh? Well, if I were you, I would start planning our first date. Before any kids. I could do that. So... all this happened because we kissed. What happens if we kiss again?
