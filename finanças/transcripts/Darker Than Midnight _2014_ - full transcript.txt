Inspired by a true story # I feel... I feel... # Sometimes I feel... # Sometimes I feel... # Sometimes I feel... Davide! #...like a motherless child - # Sometimes I feel... - Davide! - #...like a... - Davide! Darker than midnight Dad - It's Tafano's turn to give the usher a BJ. Let Funcia do it. His lips will drive him wild. - He has syphilis; I'm not going to blow him. - Just give him a handjob, then. Ettoressa would settle for a handjob, but Piero wants to be sucked. Do you have something to give me, princess? I'm sorry, I don't have anything Get lost! The police! Run! Run! Run! What's the problem? Let's see if we can find some clients. Come. Come with me. I'll pay you. Come on. - Will you pay me? - No. Forget about it, then. - Excuse me... - Please... Get your hands off me, you pig! Will you keep ''your dad'' company? - Just 15 euros. - For what? I'll give you a handjob. 15 euros for a handjob?! Are you crazy or what? Tonight is my turn. Are you still here? - Have you brought a friend? Good. - I've never seen him before. Take off your clothes. Here's the money. Split it with him, OK? Do you think you can solve the problem in this way? Let me pray in peace. People find him disgusting. Praying is useless. Come on. Go, darling. Go away! You idiot! I'll rip your head off! Look at this hobo! Fuck off! Did you sleep here? Be careful: the hoboes might eat you! - How did it go yesterday? - He asked for his money back. We didn't do anything. What's in your backpack? Where did you get them? I stole them. What do you need them for? You can't even play them. If he throws away his cigarette, it means we can go in. - What's your name? - Davide. They call me ''Rettore'' (Italian singer). (Donatella Rettore singing ''Amore stella'') # l, # who am nothing and nobody, # I wonder what god I would become # if I were a part of your life, # if what you do were a little bit mine He's convinced that playing a record for more than 30 seconds can damage it. It's thanks to me that he knows about David Bowie. This is the first time he has seen you, and he'll take your picture. - Hi, Vito. - Hi, Rettore. - She's ''The Minor''. - Fuck off! If you have sex with my client for free, then he'll stop paying me. Listen, it's my pussy, and I decide whom to offer it to, OK? Besides, I love him. We need money. All you think of is money. What happened? What's important for me, is that they pay my rent. - Hello, ducky. - Hello. - Hi, Meriliv. - You whore! I can't stand Arazio anymore. He's a pain in the ass! What do you want from me?! - Hey! - Leave me alone or I'll smack you! - Where are you going, Meriliv? - You're a pain in the ass! Who is he? A friend of yours? - Yes, he's a friend. - Another whore! - Hi, Mary Poppins. - Hi. We call him ''Meriliv Morlov'', because he's so ignorant he can't even pronounce ''Marilyn Monroe''. He calls disco lights ''blinkers''. He's even dumber than I am! Hi. - Hello, Daisy. - Hello, Daisy! Hi, Franchina. - Don't you need any condoms tonight? - No, I have enough condoms. Hi, Marcella. - Where are you going? - For a walk. A walk... Earn your bread: these are buttery, you know. Someday I'll have boobs, too, but I haven't them yet. Smile, Snow White: life is wonderful and colourful! - Hi, Lina. Who the fuck did that to you? - A bunch of bastards. - Hello, guys. - Hello. Hi, Meriliv. - Hi. I'm Roberto. - I'm Davide. You have lice again?! Don't get me started. Every day something happens to me. - Better lice than crabs. - Definitely. - With that wig on, you can't get lice. Hey, leave me alone. Stay away from young boys. You pedo! - Are you a girl? - Yes. - Beat it! - Beat it, you junkie. He's mine. - Are you a female? - I'm both a male and a female. - You can see that he's not a stud! - It's obvious. Hi, Stick. Do you have a plaster, Little Red Riding Hood? No, I only have some condoms. - Hi, Alfio. How did it go yesterday? - It went all right. - Where are you going to sleep tonight? - I have no idea. Maybe in Villa Bellini Park or at the station. See you later. I have to go, darling. - Hi, Iris! - Hi. You're always hot, aren't you? Rettore! Rettore! - I can go with you. - You're ugly. - But I'm cheap. - How much? - 15 euros. - I'll give you 10. OK? Okay. Let's go. Let's go. Put it on the left. - Don't cut it too short. - OK, madam. Cut it up to here. If it's too short, he won't look good. Towel... Thanks. Who's coming to church? Your godfather and godmother. We need them. - Are they coming to lunch, too? - No, they aren't coming to lunch. Your father wants it to be just us. So Grandma isn't coming either. I don't know... I guess not. You know what? I won't put on any makeup. Sit down. - What? - Sit down. Purse your lips. I've never been good at makeup. And now, with these eyes, I always make a mess. Stay still. - Your grandma was very good at it, instead. - Stay still! No! I liked that song. Why did you change the channel? - Everyone was looking at you in church today. Even the priest. - Thank you. Davide, eat. Massimo... What? Bring the TV closer. When they arrest you, they don't care how you get back home. Fucking cops. I hate them. What are you doing here? Looking for dope? - You're working the streets, then. - No. Are you gay, at least? - I liked a boy once. - What? - I liked a boy once. - Everything's all right. He's gay. You can see he's a queer from a mile away! Come here. Don't make that face. Have you never stolen anything? - Not so much at once. - ''Not so much at once.'' You whore! Where did Rettore find you? - In a porn theatre. - That's what I thought... Let's go. You're skinny: put six jackets on. Hurry up! - Which one? - This one. I'll take this. How do I look? She looks just like the Virgin Mary. If she's the Virgin Mary, then I'm St. Agatha! At least Mary died a virgin. You weren't even a virgin at birth. I can't help it if everyone wants me. I can't help it. Stick this pittance up your asshole now that it has got bigger! Give me that money. Tomorrow I'll come to your shop to take a CD and some earphones, understood? It's also crumpled... Give me something. I'm hungry. Why don't you go and steal like everyone else, instead of begging? No! Bless you all! Stupid bitch... - Come. - No, thanks. No, he won't fuck you. He's a saint. I'll come with you. - Why don't you sew a star on it? - I like it the way it is. - Do you like mine? - It looks crazy. - It's Op-Art style. - What's ''Op-Art'' style? It's all frayed! - Do you like my shoulder pads? - Very nice. ls that a bra? I stole it from Meriliv! - Mine are better. - Where did you find them? Didn't you notice that I stole his bag? Your jacket is full of studs. - Hey... - I hadn't asked you to do that. But I'm totally in love with you, Meriliv. - Once a whoremonger, always a whoremonger! - What's a whoremonger? - Someone like Arazio. No smoking in the car. Arazio can't stand it. Thank you. (they sing ''Amore stella'') # O Love, star that I don't have, # where did I lose you? In what universe will I find you again? # O Love, love that I don't have, # how many damned nights will I have to look for you? Let's go! Davide... come on! Come! Go and get some sandwiches. We're hungry. # O Love, star that I don't have (...) Come. Let's get something to eat. Why are you looking at me all the time? - Take me to the attic. - Why? What's in the attic? Shut up and stay out of this. Davide. - I'll take you to the attic. Come. - Leave him alone. - Stay out of this. Enough! - Leave him here with me. Leave him be, Massimo. Come on! Let's go home, Dad. Dad, please... Let's go back home, Dad. Let's go home, Dad. Come on, Dad, let's go home, please. What are you doing here? - Go to work, like your father taught you. - He can't teach me anything! What did you say? Now I'll take you to the construction site, Antonio! Let go of me! Come here, Antonio! Where are you going? - The cops are coming! - Run! Run! - Go away if you aren't working the streets. - Who said I'm not working the streets? I bet you've never been laid in your life. Now you've gone over the line. Stop it. The showgirls have arrived. Come here. Both of you. You sit in the front. Relax, OK? Thank you. Have I seen you before? - What's your name? - Davide. - How old are you? - 1 4. How many times have I told you that you have to protect your face? That crazy woman is singing. Let her sing... Alfio, somebody is stinking up the air. Nice clothes at a good price! They're a steal! These nice shawls cost only 50 cents. The faggots are here. What a stink! Take it easy. What did I say to make you so angry? Relax. (she recites a lyric poem) Christ, you're already here early in the morning! Get outta here! Isn't your boyfriend coming today? - Which one? - Arazio. ''Which one''! He has so many boyfriends, you know... Excuse me. Louvre is here. Come. Excuse me... Excuse me... Louvre will come on stage from there. - ls she really as tall as Wonder? - She's taller than Wonder in heels. Easy, guys. I'm pregnant. - The violinist isn't playing tonight. - He always plays. - They broke up. - It's not true. They'd never break up. - She's come straight from London. - She probably buys her clothes there. - No, she makes her clothes herself. - She really buys them in London. - You're wrong. - She really buys them there. There she is! Louvre, Louvre, Louvre... - What do you want? - You're great. What's your next gig? We'll go to Taormina first, and then to Milazzo. What do you feel when you sing? What do I feel? I feel... some freedom. - How is London? - I've never been to London. - I want to go with you. - To do what? To sing. - What a cheeky little boy you are! - I'm no longer a little boy. Are you ready? I'm tired. Run the light. Run the light. Come on! Go! Go! Go! Davide! Hey, don't worry. Calm down: he didn't get you. OK? Walk towards the window. Come back. Sit down. Can I go now? - What do you want to do to me? - Stay still. - Massimo, don't beat him! - Stop! - Stay still! - Massimo, don't beat him! - What do you want to do to me? - If you stay still, we'll be done in a minute. - Let me do it. - You can't see well. Let go of me! Let go of me! Done. See? Come on, get up. Hey, take your hands off me, you bastards! Ouch! Rettore, help me! Rettore! What the fuck do you want? Ouch! Help! Are you OK? Are you feeling better? Where did they take him? - Where did they take him, Wonder? - I don't know. Where is he? Look at the state of you! Piece of shit... - Let's spend the night with the pig. - Which ''pig''? - The one at the porn theatre. - I'm not going there. - He doesn't want to go there. - Stop mimicking me. I work the streets because I want to. I'm the ''daughter'' of jewellers. I have sex every day because I like it. If you don't like it, it's not my fault. I like to be grabbed by the hips. I look them straight in the eye, I begin to talk to them, and they become aroused. I know you don't want to go there because you kneed him in the balls. If he catches you, he'll skin you alive. Let's go. Meriliv, wait. Wait for me. Are you really going there? - Are you coming with us? - If you go, I'm going, too. Just for tonight. Who did that to you? I don't know. You're handsome. A client is coming. Can I come back here? Okay. Antonio, what are you doing? Your father was right to give you a thrashing. My father came to me the other day. Instead of running as usual, I put my hand on my heart, and I began to sing ''Amore stella''. As soon as he heard ''I wonder what god I would become'', he started shouting: ''Don't blaspheme! Don't blaspheme!'' # l, who am nothing and nobody, # I wonder what god I would become # if I were a part of your life, # if what you do were a little bit mine # I would let you burn me ''And I would go to hell or deeper if you were down there'' Did you think I had forgotten the lyrics? Davide! - I can't help you. Sorry. - You said I could come back. When? - You said I could come back any time. - I told you a lie. A month passes quickly. Please. I'll cook for you. You're crazy! A month?! At my house?! Then I'll leave forever. I promise. - Don't let me sleep on the streets. - You can't live in my house. I'll pay you rent. - With what money? - I'll find the money. Yeah, sure. I have to go. Bye. - Hi, Davide. - Hi. Wait for me at home. Get in so we can talk. - But I have to go out. - Wait for me at home, I said. Are you afraid? What do we need to talk about? I've been told that you sing beautifully. By whom? All rumours that fly over Catania land on my ears, sooner or later. (he sings an aria from Scarlatti's ''Il Pompeo'') # O stop wounding me, # O leave me to die! # O leave me to die! # Eyes so ungrateful, merciless, # Eyes so ungrateful, merciless, # more than ice and more than marble, # cold and deaf to my sufferings! # cold and deaf to my sufferings! The world is full of people who can sing well. But it takes years to make it big, and one may faiI to make it big. What does one have to do in the meanwhile? One has to survive, right? I think so. - Are you begging? - No. Are you stealing here and there? In this world, you won't get anywhere if you don't have someone to protect you. I have to go now. You kids are always in a hurry, huh? If you need me, you can find me there, every day. Except Sundays. What happened? What happened, guys? Wonder, what happened? Rettore... There they are. Look at them. I've seen them. Look at them. I've seen them. A mother's kisses heaI all wounds. This wound has healed. This one has healed, too. And so has this one. - I'll get some food. You get everything else. - OK. - Please give me some money. - Go away. Give me some money or I'll tell her everything. Excuse me: this boy is stealing. Let go of me. Come on. I'm not going to turn you in, this time. You're pretending not to know me. You're a fucking whoremonger. Let go of me. Fucking whoremonger! Your husband is a whoremonger, did you know? Your husband is a whoremonger! A fucking whoremonger! Let go of me! Davide, is that you? - Yes, it's me. - Darling... - How are you? Have you lost weight? - No, no. I'm fine, and you? - How are you? Are you eating enough? - I'm okay. I eat every day. Take me to the bus stop. Help me. Please, Mom, don't tell Dad you saw me here. You know I can't hide things from him. - Tell him, then. I'm off. - You're not going anywhere. I won't let you go. Come here. The Lord has brought us back together. - Come on, let's go home. - No, Mom, please. No. I won't let him beat you. I'll protect you. Don't worry. Your father won't touch you. He'll have to kill me first. He'll have to kill me first. Come on. Be careful, Mom. Let's get on. I'm not leaving you here. Wait. Let me help you. What do we have to do? You've slimmed down. Order something. - A sandwich. - Two sandwiches. Two sandwiches, certainly. - Here you are. - How much is it? 5 euros. Shall we go? - What are we doing here? - What are we doing here? This is my house! Did you think he had bought it with a mortgage? Before he met me, he was a beggar. He lived under bridges. It's his pretty face that saved him. This music sucks! Come on. From now on, you'll have nothing to worry about, because I'll protect you. I knew right away you were a smart kid. And you've made the right choice. Money will no longer be a problem for you. I won't send you out to work the streets. You'll work at home. I just have to see where you can work; this house is already occupied. ''Each man kills the thing he loves.'' ''Each man kills the thing he loves.'' ''Each man kills the thing he loves.'' ''Each man kills the thing he loves.'' See you next Monday, at the bar. At 6:00 am. Are you hungry? No, I've already eaten. You can have them all for 50 euros. He's dead. Can I listen to it for 30 seconds? (Donatella Rettore singing ''Amore stella'') Pull it. Be careful, you idiot. Come on! Oh, fuck! Let go of me! Let go of me! Dad... What are you doing? Are you crazy? Davide! Davide! Davide! Help! Help! Help! Open your eyes, Davide. Davide! Answer me! - Open your eyes. - You cannot enter. Why can't I enter? Davide! Davide! What are you looking at? I didn't do it! I didn't do it! English subtitles by YRR and Alex Translation of ''Il Pompeo'' by T. Baker (1 851-1934)
