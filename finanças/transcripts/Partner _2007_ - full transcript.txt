It's said that in India a boy is born in every 3 seconds. And a girl in every 10 seconds. But that day... something different had happened. Only one boy was born amidst 30 girls. Wow! This naked boy looks so smart! He looks just like me! In fact this baby is me! Prem! Yes! The sole hero of this story! This was my first eye contact with girls. Let it be. My affair with that nurse didn't get anywhere. People fail in love and they become drunkards. But I started drinking milk. And then I started growing up in a big joint family. We were 7 siblings in our family. 6 sisters... and... I... Their only brother. My childhood was surrounded with two things. Toys... and children... I mean girls. An average child in his childhood thinks that... he will become an engineer. Doctor... ...or cricketer when he grows up. But in my case. God's plan was something different. Because of my upbringing. I started understanding... all kind of girls' feelings. And I started helping those unfortunate boys... ...whom no girl ever glanced at. And gradually I became love guru. These girls! Very lucky! Do you know? 99 percent girls get the guy of their choice! But 99 percent guys don't find the girl of their choice. Their love ends before it could even begin. And my work begins here. - Love guru, you know I... - What's the name of the girl? - I don't know! Does it really matter? - It matters to me! Actually she too... Loves you. Yes! Yes! Yes! Yeah! But she too... - She too stammers like you? - No. No! - Oh! She feels shy! - Yes! Look. Your situation is very good! You begin the matter and she will end it. My ignorant heart. What has happened to me? - What is the antidote of this pain? - What's your problem? In the entire universe amongst so many beautiful faces... I locked eyes with such a girl... that my life has become radiant. Good morning. Uncle. This is my first love. Dear... is this what the teacher teaches you in school? I have fallen in love with my teacher. By the way. Uncle. Do you give discount to students? Come after 10 years. Okay. Go. I can't see her without my specs. And she doesn't want to see me in specs. This is very simple! Remove your specs! Fantastic! You are looking so good! Thank you! Here! React at the sound! So like this. Smart. Stupid. Carefree. Nervous... I taught so many people to love! I made them love! Get married! I was at the peak of my success! But my happiness didn't last for long. Do you know why? Do you wanna partner... - Bhaskar! Right? - Yes! And you? - You have come to meet me. - Love guru! Love guru in front of me! My first love! It's my first love! My family's first love! Before this my parents. Grandparents... nobody loved at this level. What kind of a girl do you want? She should be beautiful! Intelligent! With a good nature! In this time of inflation... how will you be able to afford three girls? Tell me. Not three. Its three in one who has won my heart. She is true at heart. There she is! She is hale and hearty! Don't be tense. Don't worry. Your work will be done. My brother! I am lucky! Brother Prem! You are a great man! Priya. Did you hear? Hello! What are you doing. Bhaskar? You love one girl and you kiss another girl. What do you mean? I kissed the girl whom I want to marry! She is Priya! She is the lucky one! Hero. Do you know who she is? Priya Jaisingh! Raj Jaisingh's daughter! Owner of 1000 crores! Not just you. Even I can't entice her! Forget about it. Dude! No chance! Impossible! Impossible! Brother Prem... impossible? I had heard there is no such word in your dictionary. Say that this is not true! This is the truth. Bhaskar! Bhaskar Diwakar Chaudhary! Yes! I can befriend Bush and Osama. But your affair with her is impossible! Just forget about it. Man! But brother Prem. Listen to me! Brother Prem! Bush? Osama? That international matter! And this is a small love story! Where is he taking the matter? Brother Prem! Welcome after the break! Let's ask our celebrity guest Priya Jaisingh... some of her personal answers. Oh my! Priya! Welcome back to the show. Ms. Priya. So. Ms. Priya. What is your definition about love? Well. My beloved. Not found him yet! As it is nowadays you don't find good guys. What are you saying. Priya? I am available everyday in the office between 9 to 5. So many times I did overtime too. One thing is for sure. My beloved whether he is a high profile. Big shot or not... but he will surely be simple and sound. Thank you. Thank you very much. Who knows? Maybe my future life partner is watching me right now. He might be standing in front of the TV. I am in front of you. Hey! Let me also see her! She is so hot! Who said that? Who said that? Who said that? Who called her hot? Are you calling the coffee hot? No! The girl! She is so hot! Hello! You shouldn't talk disrespectfully about Priya! How did the channel change? Sit! Why did you change the channel? - Why did you change the channel? - India is batting! - Sehwag is about to score century. - Sehwag has his mother's blessing. My life is still ruined. You want to watch the match! I still can't find the matchmaker! Love guru! Love guru. I want to meet Priya. - Where are you? I am just coming! - Pay my bill! What? What bill? What bill? What money? What? - Hey, take the change at least. - You sit with respect... hey... - Hello! - Bhaskar speaking here? - Bhaskar. What did I tell you? - What did you tell me? - Don't you understand! - What? Please remind me! Forget Priya! And don't call me! Is she a dish or a dessert? Hello! Yes. I told you! How can the matter end if you say this? I love Priya. Brother Prem! Brother Prem! Brother Prem! You are in the bus! I am wandering around in my helplessness! Brother Prem. Please listen to me! Bhaskar. I can't help you! Because you are useless! And I am helpless! Leave me alone! I won't leave you till the time, you don't introduce me to Priya! If not today then I will come tomorrow! If not tomorrow then I will come day after tomorrow! I won't leave you alone! Come tomorrow! Call me! I am going to Phuket for a month! For a family holiday! And I don't have a roaming card! Brother Prem! Hey. Weather your phone is on roaming or not... but I'll roam with you. Does this bus go to Phuket? Chhota don. Who is this short guy? I am Chhota Don. A small name of two words! And only two things to do in life! Watching cricket! And killing people! I am Tendulkar of underworld! Short height. More fights. This is the secret of my becoming a Don! Sehwag and Dhoni! Is the fielding good? Otherwise the umpire will declare me as out! Bhai. Who is umpire? - Police! Who else? - Oh! So along with being a goon. You play cricket too! I used to play! 20 years ago! In Borivali lanes! I was a fast bowler! Everybody used to call me Bhindi Express! Once my ball made a batsman LBW. I made an appeal! How was that? Umpire said not out! In my angry. I hit him the ball! - The batsman? - No! The umpire! And the umpire died! The batsmen started running! The police ran after me! And since then this Bhindi Express has become Chhota Don! - Look. Bhai! - Hey! I don't talk to the 12th man! Who is the captain of the team? It's me. Bhai! Wow! Only you have the right to speak! - Whose phone is ringing? - Oh my God. Oh no. Whose mobile is ringing? Hey. Who is it? Who is Ganguli amidst us? Its third umpire. Hey! Sehwag. Run! Hey. Pathan! On the boundary! Dhoni. Surround her from mid-wicket. Nab her before she reaches the boundary! Catch her. Nab her! Nab her! Wow! How? Please start the car! Some underworld goons are after me! Underworld? Oh my God! Ma'am. You are so nice! Not just underworld. But the whole world can be after you! Listen! Please! Will you show your smartness in saving me? Smartness? I will save you from them! But who will save you from me? What? - Okay! Stop! Stop! Stop! - What? I will stop the car! Oh, what? Thanks. This is a short meeting. Listen! I will say it in my fervour! I will tell the truth! You are going away! But I will stay in touch! Halt! Hey. Useless. Unknown fellow! I want to sit here. C'mon get up! - Hey you! You will make me get up? - Yes! Hey! Don't touch! For the first time somebody has slapped me! Come on! Say sorry! Say sorry! - Did you hear that?

Prem from Ludhiyana. I don't know Prem from Patiyalawala. No. Prem from Mumbai! He is love guru. - Do you know love guru? - I only know Waheguru. - Oh. Waheguru is great. - Waheguru is great. I took Waheguru's name. Now everything will be OK? Wow! Don't you have any nice friends? - Yes! Will you marry? - No chance! Brother Prem and family! Brother. When will you marry? 3-4 years after Nikki's marriage! Why do you always postpone it! Don't you hear a voice from within? Brother Prem! Brother Prem! Not from within... I can hear some noise from outside. Brother Prem! Oh my God! - This stupid... - Prem! - Uncle! - His name is Bhaskar! Stupid Bhaskar! He harasses so much! Brother Prem! Brother Prem! Brother Prem! Hello. Sister-in-law! Such a sweet family! She... is my sister! They both... are her children. Sorry. Sister! He is so sweet like a teddy bear. Welcome to Phuket! Wow! Such sweet children! Oh my! So sweet! I told you not to follow me! What are you doing here in Phuket? I didn't come here for free (Phukhat). I took a ticket. Visa on arrival. Why are you spoiling my holidays? I am nothing! Even God can't give you Priya! - But brother Prem. Listen to me! - No buts! - Sister! - Don't involve my sister! Hang on! Please! Sister! Sister. Tell me something. When you had got married. Was it an arranged marriage... or love marriage? Of course! It was a love marriage! Brother Prem had given me away! Brother Prem. Look at this! You got your sister married! And you are not helping me! Why? Because... Priya is Mercedes and you are Maruti. If Priya is Boeing then you are a bullock cart! If Priya is Kohinoor diamond then you are Kohinoor rice! If Priya is capable then you are a fool! This is the bus to go to India! Take the window seat and leave! Take this man to the airport! Don't bring him back! All yours! Okay! Go! Don't play the band! Don't play the band! - Go your way. - Hey! Prem. This is not fair. What happened? Bhaskar had come from India with high hopes. - And you told him to return. - Uncle Bhaskar is so sweet! And Prem uncle so rude! What? Kids. What do you both think? He must have left? Nobody can evade death. Love and Bhaskar! Did you hear that? Now let's go! We are still in danger! - No! - Uncle. It is you? Queen. Spin around. So much of water. The lake is filled with water. - So will float... - King. Bhaskar. Don't make a noise! You are lying here naked! Leave! Get out! Get lost! Brother Bhaskar. Here is the towel. Will you wear this T-shirt? Thank you! Hey! Are you blind? These are my clothes! How will it fit this Bhaskar! Don't worry! It will fit me! Body hug! My size is such that any size fits me! Have you come to your in-law's house? Brother Prem... what was I saying? I am here only! I am not going anywhere! Brother Prem.

You have taken so many sacrifices from this house. - Listen to me! - Nothing will go wrong now. I am telling you. - Listen... - Listen to what? Brother! - No. Bhaskar. - What no? - Listen to me. - No. What happened to him? What was he suffering from? - No. No. - Shut up! You don't listen to the whole thing! Why? What happened? Brother-in-law is in America! He is a scientist in NASA! He is hale and hearty! Meaning he is alive! He is the father of 2 children! And he is a married man! That is what I was thinking! A person which such a glow in his eyes. He can't die. I pray for brother-in-law's long life. That is true. Brother. I will serve lunch. Today I have cooked brother Prem's favourite dish. Chicken Tandoori! Chicken Tandoori! It's my favourite dish too. And when both of us like Chicken Tandoori... then why should we dislike each other? Hot lentils are ready! Pass me the butter. I am on a diet. Take this. You are dieting and want to eat butter. The way mother Yashoda had given butter to Krishna... I got to each such butter at your place. - Hey. Shut up. - I am famished. She is my sister! She is not some bread piece! - That you are buttering her! - Oh yeah! What was that? Who spoke? Now see. You can't rule over burp and love... they are free to come out. Right sister? Right kids? Shut up! Eat your food! And go! Otherwise I will kill you! Kill you for what? There is no flight for 4 days! How can I go home? You can leave after 4 days! It's okay! It's okay! Listen! King of snoring! You can neither sleep with me nor with her! Don't worry. Uncle Bhaskar! You can sleep in our room! Did you see that? Children's heart is bigger than your room. Learn something from them! Learn something! I will call your husband. And tell him that an unknown man has become a part of our family! Hey! Oh my God! What is he saying? Tell him that I am like your brother. More than a brother. Hey don't worry. He will be alright. There are so many new kinds of toys for kids! In this age of playing with marbles... you have got entangled in what? Leave it! It's a baby missile! A kind of rocket! You must have seen it in war. It follows the enemy and attacks them. Is that so? How does this work? With a battery? Not on battery. My voice. It gets activated when I say go baby go. Is that so? You are fooling your uncle! If that was true. Wouldn't it have fired... when you said go baby go? I have to give the final touch up tonight. Don't disturb me. Final touch up! He'll give! - Good morning everybody! - Good morning! Good morning. Sister! Good morning. Brother! Good morning. Mr. Prem! Wow! Mind-blowing! Amazing body. Brother Prem! Too good! Is it since childhood or did you build it later? Too good! What sisterly emotion! Wow! What clothes! Sister. Is it available readymade or you have to get it stitched? - Readymade! - What? - You get it readymade. - Okay! Okay! Brother Prem. Why are you going in the water alone? Teach jet ski to me too. It might impress Priya. You never know! Seeing open body... Zip his mouth too. He has been behind me since morning. Brother Prem. The fact is that there is no zip. And brother Prem. I won't leave you so easily. I am like this missile! If I go after a person. I don't leave him alone. You just have to say it once. Go. Baby. Go! Uncle. Don't say that! It will get activated! Are you mad? Why Will I say go baby go? It's yours! It listens to your voice! You say go baby go! Just now you said go baby go! Hey. What happened? Uncle. This has activated. - Uncle! - Nephew! - Nephew! - Uncle! Stop it! - Uncle! - Nephew! - Uncle. The missile is about to leave. - Come back. What? I can't hear you. It is gone! Rocket! Hey brother. Escape and save us. Bhaskar. Scoundrel... let me come out of the water first... Save me. Oh god. Hey. Go somewhere else. Why are you behind me? Go somewhere else. Oh lord. Please save me. Bhaskar. Let me escape from this then I'll teach you a lesson. Bhaskar! Bhaskar! Leave my house! Get lost! Leave this place! Sorry! By mistake the rocket got activated! By mistake! Your birth is a mistake in itself. I could have died! Do you know the cost of that jet ski? 10 lakhs! What do I know? I have always travelled by local train. - You! - Brother! Please! It was an accident! Please! Brother Bhaskar. Say sorry to Prem! Please! - Prem... I am sorry. - Sorry! You... Kids. Come on! Uncle Bhaskar and I are having a fight. So go out! I regret that you turned out to be... much more stupid than what I thought of you! Forget Priya! You can't even entice Priya's dog! Do you know why? Because Bhaskar... you are the brand ambassador... of foolishness and stupidity! Brand ambassador! And before leaving listen to one thing. Bhaskar! If you can't live without Priya... then don't live! Because if a stupid and foolish lover dies... then it won't make any difference to the world. Got it? Kids. Come! Bid your dear uncle Bhaskar goodbye! Uncle Bhaskar is leaving forever! Pammi. Remove him within 5 minutes. Otherwise I will leave at the 6th minute! - The decision is yours. - Please Prem. Uncle Bhaskar! Uncle Bhaskar! Prem! Are you crying? Brother Bhaskar... Prem is a nice guy. Please don't mind him and cry. I... I am not crying. Sister Pammi. I am laughing. Brother Prem is right. It was my mistake... that I fell in love with Priya. There is a huge difference between Priya and me. I was searching for a girl's love. And I got the love of a family. So I stayed here. So I stayed here. Look. I am an idiot. No. What was brother Prem saying? Yes! Loser! But you tell him one thing. He is doing a great task. He shouldn't stop! Uniting lovers! What about me? Fine. Brother Bhaskar! Brother Bhaskar! Brother Bhaskar! Phuket to Bangkok! Bus meets with an accident! 39 passengers saved! One critically injured! Bhaskar was travelling by this bus! I am sure Bhaskar is the one! Bhaskar's name is not written in this! How can you say that it's Bhaskar! I can say that because Bhaskar is the King of bad luck! Problems don't go after Bhaskar! But Bhaskar runs after problems! - All this happened because of you! - Why because of me? If you had not send him by bus then today he would have been here! - Thank God he was on the bus! - You are so mean! No! I am not mean! What is mean is that... I too want that Bhaskar should be fine. He should lose his memory! So that he won't harass me! - Stupid Bhaskar! - Prem! Listen! Where is the man who died in the bus accident? Some passenger of seat number 50. His name was Bhaskar. Bhaskar. Shit man. Bhaskar. Bhaskar. Please forgive me. Look. What has happened? I told you to forget your love. And you left the world. Love is in nobody's control. But you left in the bus. And you made all of us helpless. You should have at least given my one chance. I would have introduced you to Priya. You are that lover... who took his beloved's name... and left his bag for me. Bhaskar. You are not dead. Because Bhaskar never die. God bless your soul. Bhaskar. Say something. I don't know why I feel that you will suddenly get up... and embrace me. And you will forgive me. I forgive you. Oh no! Bhaskar. You are alive! Bhaskar. You are alive? Yes! Bhaskar is alive! Hale and hearty! Oh no. Man! - How did this happen? - It's all his grace. - Who is he? Who is this? - He is uncle John. When I sat in the bus... he said... dear... can I sit in your seat? I want to see the valleys from the window. I said. Why not. Sit. Here there is only destruction. At least you see the valleys. Poor man... he died while watching the valleys. And I came in this lovely hospital. - Its Wadia hospital. - Yes. This is destiny! Your good luck... and my bad luck. No. Prem! I heard it! You love me so much. I forgive you! You have a pure heart! You worry so much... I am touched! Don't touch me! Don't touch me! You didn't die! So I break my promise! Brother Prem just now you were talking so lovingly with me! Look. Brother Prem! I have fooled death! - I won't leave you alone! - Is that so? Because you are the messiah who can form my alliance with Priya. When Priya will give me a son. I will name him Prem! - How sweet! - I will keep your photo in my house! Thank you! Brother Prem. Please help me! No! - You will have to help me! - No! - Brother Prem. You will help me! - I won't help you! - Brother Prem. You will have to help me! - No! - Was he that same uncle John? - Not was. He is alive. Do you want a partner. O partner? Do you want a partner? Love me. Love me. Do you want a partner. O partner? Do you want a partner? Do you want a partner. O partner?

My pant! My pant got wet! It will look as if I have wetted my pants. - Hello. - Bhaskar... Priya went into the building. All set. No! All wet! All wet! Clumsy, Bhaskar? Hello! Interesting dress code! Stupid Bhaskar! - Bhaskar! - Yes! Nice. Are you going to the office or the school? Brother Prem. Don't stop me! Priya is waiting for me! Come on! Look Bhaskar 8 out of 10 girls will be impressed with this. But she is from those 2, dude. You are practically nude. Why? What's the problem? Stupid Bhaskar! Rock the conference room's atmosphere! That it will daze Priya. It should amaze her! She gets shocked! Shock and rock! Shock and rock! Shock and rock! Shock and rock. Baby! Shock and rock! Shock and rock! Excuse me! I am sorry I am delayed! I am so sorry! Sorry. Brother. Sorry madam. Oh my god. I am so sorry. Everything is all right. Shall we go ahead? Thank you. Gentlemen. I need your advice. I want to invest in my childhood friend's business. It's a designer diamonds' business. The investment will be about a 100 crores. I would like to help my friend. But what is everybody's opinion? Should we go for this venture or not? Ma'am. Without the market research, we don't even buy vegetables. And these are diamonds. Correct. Ma'am. Personal relationship and company's 100 crores... not a good idea. You have a point. Does anybody else want to say anything? 'Rock the conference room's atmosphere! ' 'That it will daze Priya. No! I mean yes! Yeah! Can I say something? Can I say something? Now he too will say something! Excuse me! Please! Let him speak! Thank you! How old are you? What's your age? 25! Why? You are 25 years old and your IQ is zero. I mean 25 years old and brain of a 5 years old child. - Have you lost it? - What? - What? What? You can invest so much money in business! Can't you use a bit of your brain? Why do you need their brains and advice to take decision? But you all are my financial advisors. What advisors? Does the sun advice the clouds? Excuse me. Can I come out? Does the lake take advice from mountains? Whether I should meet the ocean or not. Forget about this! These are important things! Does a small innocent child ask the family's advice... to pee on his mother's lap? The child just does it! - You too take the decision! - But how? Like this! When you didn't think before befriending your friend... ...then why are you thinking before helping her? And as it is... whose advice are you taking? This mister Bagga, he is not faithful to his wife. He has never even brought flowers for sister-in-law. What advice will he give you? And whose advice are you taking? Mr. Chaddha! He can't even wear his underwear! He will change your company's policy? These are rich people. Now take my example. I... we for a job of 30,000 rupees. We wait for the 30th. How can we take the decision of 100 crores within 3 seconds? Come on. Ma'am! And first take the decision that... ...you will take your own decisions! And don't take all the decisions using your mind. Take some decisions with your heart too. I know... you have a golden heart. Hey! Are you with me? Mr. Bhaskar! You are crossing your limits! What the hell are you saying? Who the hell are you to yell on me? And who the hell are you to tell me that I'm talking hell! I am not talking hell! I am talking well! And if we don't gel. Then you can go to hell! Okay! You don't have manners to talk to your seniors! - You shut up! - You are fired! You shut up! If you are my senior then I am senior to you in intellect! I... I am leaving the job! I am leaving! Before you throw me out. I myself will leave. Where a person doesn't have the freedom to speak and think... ...there what can a person speak and think? Greetings! Goodbye! I don't want to work here! I don't know about you! But I will miss you! They messed up with me. It is impossible. - So how was it. Bhaskar? - Fantastic! -Good! - I insulted Priya. - Wow! - I said whatever came in my mind! - Wow! - And I flung my resignation letter on his face! - Great! - What have I done? What have I done? - Meaning? For my love. I lost my livelihood! You... you had told me! Shock her and she will notice you! And I gave the notice of my resignation! I will have to apologise to her! I will have to go to her! - I am coming! - Bhaskar! You cannot go! Brother Prem. I am very poor man. You won't go anywhere! She herself will come to you! She won't come for 10 lifetimes. My work is limited only to this lifetime! It's not for many lifetimes! Count to 10! 10... 9... 8... Why are you putting me into trouble! 5... 4... 3... 2... here she comes. This is what you think. Go. Go and open the door. But let me open the door! Hello. Bhaskar. Shut your mouth otherwise she will see your feelings. Hello. Ma'am. Bhaskar, nobody has ever spoken to me like this. I was just about to... Don't kneel. Take the support of the door. Excellent. Bhaskar! Excellent! - I liked the way you spoke to me! - What? I don't want those people in my company... who always agree with me. I am so impressed! Yes. Ma'am! I mean no ma'am. Actually I was thinking... that if we both go out for dinner this week? Actually I want to take some financial decisions. So... let's meet. Along with dinner we can talk about business too. Dinner. Okay. Okay! Dinner. Sure. Sure! Dinner. Done. Done. Done! I will have to check the appointments. You will have to take appointment! No! I am ready! Whenever you want! Wherever! - I will give you my number! - Yes! - Do you have a pen? - Pen? Thank you! She is very beautiful. Very beautiful. Thank you! Thank you. Priya ma'am! Bhaskar. Not Priya ma'am. Just Priya. So much happiness... so much happiness! So much happiness! Stop. Stop. Take this! I have never been so happy! Your happiness is coming out of the nose! - So much happiness! - Take this! You are really very happy! I'll not leave you today. - Help! - You are trying to click my photograph. Run! Run nicely and briskly! Run! What style! You need help? Prem is always ready to help people like you! But tell me something! Are you Hanuman's fan or Superman's sister? Just help me. Easy! Sit! - Go. Go. - Hold me tightly! - Move! - He is coming. Hold me tightly! Hold me tightly! Now. I'll finish her. Hey! Hey! Hey! - What did you say? - Leave! What did you say? She has clicked my snap. Tell her to first give me that. You shorty. First you develop. - Who are you? - I am Don. I am Don! Police of 11 countries are after me! Is that so? And you must be in talks with the 12th country! - Yes! - You fool! Why are you hitting me. Rascal? - Shall I leave you? - Yes. Leave me.

Chhota Don doesn't raise his hands on children! But can the child raise his hands on Don? - Answer him! - What? If you have no answer. Then take this! Take this! - Will you do it again? - What? - Peeing! - No! You do it! - I? Let's go! Boss. Are you okay? Don't leak out this matter. Otherwise my image will be tarnished in the underworld! Dear. We have reached your home. Come. Shall I have to bring you out? - Hi. Handsome! - Hi my baby! Nice guy! But I will have to think a bit. Naughty boy! - You both have gelled well. - Yes.

But still Priya and my affair is not progressing. - Whose fault is it? - Who? - Who? - Who? This is what I am asking... I am saying it's because of kiss. Meaning a kiss. Till the time you won't kiss Priya... your affair won't progress. No. No! I have never kissed a girl. So do it now. Any problem? - Not I. But Priya might have a problem. - Why? She is a rich girl. Why Will she kiss a common man like me? Don't worry. Girls shut their eyes before kissing. So she won't see your face. Oh! But is it necessary to kiss in love? Yes! It's very important! Because 8 out of 10 girls know in the first kiss itself... whether this relationship will go further or not. I have a great idea! Shall I give a flying kiss to Priya? Are you Superman? Spiderman? You are a common man. Kiss like a common man. Okay. One final and last question. While kissing Priya... shall I hold my breath inside... or shall I exhale? Asthma patient! What will you stop and what will you let go? How much will you think for a kiss? I think... now I should leave. Anything else? "If a girl wants to kiss you then... she will pretend to be deep in thoughts and she will play with the keys. It's so chilly! It's quite late! I think now I should leave! Priya! Bhaskar! - Priya! - Dad! Yes. Dad! I think now I will have to leave! You must meet dad! Come! Bhaskar Diwakar Chaudhary from Indian institute of management! Ahemadabad! 1990! First class! Of course!

Boys like you ruin the lives of many girls. - What evidence do you have? - Evidence. What for? I am just a journalist in Mumbai Masala newspaper... that writes spicy gossip news. People read the gossip along with tea in the paper and... think that it is true. They don't even think about it. Just one article from me and your image is finished. Listen babe. You are crossing the line I can sue you. - Hey. What are you doing? - Chill. Thanks for the interview. And now I will print your statement in the newspaper... along with your colour photograph. Look Naina please. Save me from this. How much money do you want? I don't want money. Tell me the name. Neil... Neil Bakshi. Not your name you idiot. The name of that love guru. With whose help you ruined Nikky's life. I don't know his name. But I have his business card. - Will this do? - Almost. Oh yes. I forgot to tell you thank you. Idiot! Nikki, will that scoundrel come or not. Relax Naina. He will come. Where is he? Come on. Till then you click some of my snaps. Good idea. Go ahead. Shoot. Love guru. You are not love guru. - Love guru. - Excuse me! - Love guru. - Yes. One minute! He has come. Seems like he has arrived. You have fallen in love. Yes. It is so that the girl is 50 years old... and I am 25 years old. So you know there is a communication gap. That's not a communication gap that's... a generation gap. And it will keep on increasing. When you will be 50 years old... she will be 75 years old. By the way. Who gave you my number? How does he look? Say something. Let me see his face. No. Let it be don't see it. What do you mean. Let me see! Nikki! Hey.hey.hey Staying alive... Mother Mary save me! Hey. Hey. Hey staying alive. I am staying alive. Hey. Hey. Hey staying alive. I am staying alive. Hey. Hey. Hey, haaaaa!!!

Have you understood or not? And for her. I can face the entire world in the Midday. I will change the Outlook of the entire world. Don't break my shop. Why are you breaking my shop?

Love guru I am ruined... and you are asking me where am I? Meet me somewhere. It is urgent. They want to lock me up. And you want to meet me... just hold on a minute. - Excuse me. Excuse me. - Yes brother. - There is money in my left pocket. Sorry sir. It is not allowed for you... to come inside the building. Strange. Everyday you salute me and today you are stopping me. Have you forgotten. I am Bhaskar Bhaskar Diwakar Chaudhary. The company's financial advisor. I am a very close person of Ms. Priya. This is your termination letter, sir. Huh? Strange. She used to take my advice for every small thing... she took such a big decision and didn't take my advice. Bhaskar has been insulted! Those who love each other. Don't change reading the gossip of the paper. I agree that you are my boss. And the boss is always right... But... But this time... this time you are wrong. Girls are stupid! Just because one husband left her... she'll be angry against all males. You should never fall in love with a girl... and that too. A journalist. Brother Prem. You are avoiding me... you are not picking up my phone. The cards for my marriage was about to be printed... instead. My photo was printed in the papers. All this has happened because of you... you will have to do something. Sorry Bhaskar. I have stopped doing this. I cannot help you. Brother Prem. Seems like you didn't recognise me. Those who climbed the Himalayas... and walked on the moon. They didn't have a guru. They one thing that they had. Was zest in the heart and an obsessed mind. Which even I have. If I don't get Priya. Then I can do anything. Do you understand anything? Anything. Will Bhaskar commit suicide? He lost a billion dollar girl. Anyone could commit suicide. Bhaskar may do it. - Ms. Priya. My name is Prem. - I know. What are you doing in my boat? - Get out! - I want to talk to you for two minutes. Shut up. What did you get from all this? Bhaskar is your happiness... two lovers unite. What can be a bigger happiness. How. By making him act in the board room. Tell me one thing would you have ever noticed him? Why not. Maybe a bit late... but maybe I would have noticed him. His parents didn't notice him on his birth... and you would have. I don't agree Ms. Priya. But I agree. It was really great Prem... my likes. My dislikes you took care of everything. Even that. I don't know how to whistle since my childhood... and you thought him that too. - He whistled at you. The loafer. - Yes. He did the loafer dance too... and sometimes dropped coffee on his shirt... - And the best touch was that one. - What? - He took the asthma pump out. - He took the asthma pump out too. And that too before kissing me. What timing. I liked all his habits and they appeared to be cute! Why are you laughing? Because. I didn't teach him all these things... I had stopped him from doing all these things. Tell me one thing... the daughter of such a rich father, you are educated. Sensible. Stylish... how did you see sense in Bhaskar's nonsense? What do you mean? I mean. Style can be taught. But not simplicity. Not just me. No college or university of the world... can make a person nice. And you know Bhaskar is a nice person from the beginning. Oh God. What will happen to Bhaskar? Hey. What will happen. He will fall in love with me... we will get married. We will have children... and the children will call you Prem uncle. Prem uncle. - So this was your game love guru! - Bhaskar... You wanted to become the lover of my girl... and dance with joy on the boat... and I will keep waiving at you from the shore. - Bhaskar! - You hold it! I thought that you think of me as your elder brother... and Priya as your sister-in-law... but you are a stigma in the joint family! No Bhaskar! Bhaskar. Stop it? He had come here for you. Oh shit! I couldn't teach her in years... and you taught her in minutes. Bhaskar. I learnt it from you! Cheating! Stop it! I used to practice this everyday thinking about you. I would whistle all the time! Yes. Yes. You are sure. I thought you how to whistle. - You love me. - I love you. Where did brother Prem go I told him let things? Brother Prem! Brother Prem. Sorry to misunderstand you brother. So much happiness... So much happiness. Brother Prem... Keep quiet. So much happiness... Stupid Bhaskar. So much happiness. So much happiness. Today's topic is trust. If there is trust. There is love... and if there is love. Then there is life. Prem. Here. Naina. Naina please let me say something. - Don't create a scene here. - Say something. Mummy. You should fulfil the last wish of the dying person. Give him a chance. Who is dying? If you don't get her. Then you will die. Yes. Look. He knows me so well. He's a kid. I'm not. You have made love your profession. Profession? Am I a courtesan... that you say love is my profession? - Please. Let him say. - Thank you father. Father. Is it wrong to make two hearts fall in love... if it is. Then hang me. No my son. It is a divine service. Come on. You tell me if you go and tell a unknown woman... that I love you. Then what will she say? Then she will slap me. I have been slapped 27 times... and I am still a bachelor. Look the seat is empty. That seats not empty. That's a shame... some days later this seat will be empty too... until a love guru like me doesn't come in your life. - Correct. - Thank you. Son. Find someone for me too. I am single. Ready to mingle. Give me your hand. Madam he is single ready to mingle. Lord Ram. What match you have made. You are doing a wonderful job. And I love you for that. I know. But tell her that and not me. See. He will find someone here. Think about it mummy... - ...you will not find anyone better than him. - Correct. Naina. I teach the shortcut way in love... but my path is not wrong. And what about boys like Neil... whom you help to reach the girls bedroom. - Neil. Do you want to hear the truth? - What? The truth is that. I don't help people like Neil. He has taken my name just to entrap me! But it is the fault of people like you! You fall for scoundrels like Neil... and you don't even look once at simple guys like Bhaskar! That's is where I step in. I am cupid. Stupid. Love guru? I will drink milk everyday. I will do my homework too... I will never lie. I will do whatever you ask me to... but don't let him go. Mummy. You will not find a better one than him. My child. They don't make such men anymore. 0 Lord. Forgive her for she doesn't know what she has done... and forgive her for she doesn't know... what she is doing. What's she doing. What's she doing. What are you doing here? Can't you find a taxi. Shall I drop you in my car. Look. I don't know what relation we have... and if we have a relation or not... but I know. That Rohan... and I have the relation of father and son. - Isn't it Rohan? - Yes papa. Rohan. Who will drop you to school? Of course papa. You. Rohan. Who will take you to the movies? Papa. You. Rohan. Who will entice your first girlfriend for you. Of course papa you. Rohan? And who will take care of my mother? You will have to ask your mother that. - Rohan's papa. - What? You. You.

Rohan was right I can never find anyone better than you. And even if I do find one. I don't want it... - do you know why? - Why? Because I am a married man... and I already have a child. And I am a devoted father. And a wife abiding husband. Really? If you will have decide between me and Rohan? Right now. At this time. That will be the most difficult. Who is... Maybe it is Rohan. I will just come. My son Rohan. Will sleep with the mummy and daddy... Bhaskar. What are you doing here? I have come here to spend my honeymoon just like you. - Oh really. - I mean.
