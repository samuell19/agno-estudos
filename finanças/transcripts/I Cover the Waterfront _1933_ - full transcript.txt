But it's true. Have I ever been wrong? Yes! The time you got that crazy countess off the Laconia, said she was expecting a baby. Ha! She wasn't even married. Oh, well, that was her story. She sued and collected. And when you pulled that yarn about the porpoise that swallowed a pint of rye and danced a jig on the dock. The greatest fish story since Jonah and the Whale. Can I help having imagination? Come in here. The trouble with you is you've got too much imagination. Now you want to accuse Eli Kirk of murder. On a thing like this, you can only be wrong once. It's a great story. You're right about that, and I want to print it, but I've got to have the facts first. Alright, it's a fact I found this one and it's a fact somebody murdered him, and I'm gonna prove that Kirk did it. How? Kirk's got a daughter. She must know something. Is it worth expenses to you? What for? Gin and roses. Gonna make love to her? If I have to. Okay. Say, Julie, you don't remember much about Singapore, do you? No. Oh, grand. Well, I loved that funny, little island, remember? What? Yeah. Oh, it was fun. How would you like to go back there? You figuring to move? Mm-hmm. No, I've been kind of restless lately because I've got the tide in my blood. Besides, I don't like the price of fish around here. Eli, you're not in any trouble, are you? Why... Why, no. Not exactly. I thought you were going to stick to fishing. You're not gonna change your mind, are you? There ain't no money in it anymore. We better go away some place else and start over. Well, when do you want to leave?

Now, don't two and two make four? Yes, but that makes six. What do the sharks got to do with it? What am I supposed to be, a fortune teller? Maybe it's an excuse for him to go down below the border, or it's unnatural. He's pulling out of here tomorrow morning, and he's bound to try one last haul. Kirk's no fool. The minute he sees the Coast Guard, if he's got anything, he'll dump it overboard. He did it the last time. And I thought it took brains to be an editor. I'll draw you a picture. We all stay under cover until Kirk ties up at the dock, then we pounce on him and catch him with his pants down. And you find a Chinaman in his pants. Alright, I'll go for it. But either you bring me back this story or a piece of rope. Rope? Yeah, so I can tie a can to you. Give me the Coast Guard. [ Boat motor whirring ] Eli: Let it go! Take it up slow. Don't bump nothing, and don't let 'em use any hooks. I don't want this fish to be spilling its guts. Go ahead. Take it away. Wait a minute, Kirk. - Hold everything till we tell you. - Hold it. - Hold everything till we tell you. - Hold it. Don't you fellows never get tired of looking me over, huh? Orders, Kirk. Don't miss anything, boys. Well, if you feel like wasting your time, it's alright with me. Miller of The Standard. Hello, Miller. Miller of The Standard. Hello, Miller. Hello, Kirk. Good catch tonight? What are you doing on my boat? Looking for that big story I promised you. Nobody comes on my boat while I'm unloading, excepting the crew. It's what comes off your boat that interests me. You better get out of here or I'll break your back. From now on, the only thing you'll break will be rock. For 20 years... that's what they give them for smuggling. - Isn't it, Kirk? - You'll get out of here, do you hear me? - Isn't it, Kirk? - You'll get out of here, do you hear me? Okay, tough, remember me? One-Punch McCoy? Ohh. Hey, wait a minute, Kirk. Ohh. Hey, wait a minute, Kirk. Ah, Christmas has come. Put that in your pocket. The same to you, and many of them. Kirk, did you ever read the Bible? What? Someone must have told you the story of Jonah and the Whale. What do you mean? Just what I said. Huh. Find anything? Not this time. You can go ahead, Kirk. Pick it up, Jake. Hey, wait a minute. You didn't find anything? No, just another bum steer, Miller. Don't you ever get anything right? Oh, all this fuss was his idea, huh? Yeah, my idea. Hey, hold that shark! Hey, don't be giving orders on my boat! Hey, hold! Hold! So I never get anything right, huh? There's nothing on that boat. Not right now, there isn't, but he brought one in and he landed him. Well, then where is it? I'm sick and tired of you loudmouthed, half-baked newspaper reporters. Half-baked, am I? Has anybody got a knife? Yeah, here's one. Has anybody got a knife? Yeah, here's one. - Thanks. - You might as well admit you muffed this one. - Thanks. - You might as well admit you muffed this one. Yeah. Well, here's one nobody can muff. Hey, get away from that shark! [ Indistinct chatter ] Well, I'll be. [ Indistinct chatter ] Wait a minute, Kirk! You're under arrest! [ Gunshot ] Drop that knife! Newsboy: Extra, read about the Chinese smugglers. Chinese smugglers captured! Latest edition papers! [ Phone rings ] Hello? Great story, Joe. Extra out 10 minutes ago. It's the best story to come out of this town in years. It'll hit the front page of every paper in the country. I'm raising you $5 a week with a $50 bonus. Thanks, boss. If you find Kirk, I'll make it $100. He's hit pretty hard. He can't be far away. Get down to the waterfront! Find him! If you need any help, call on me. I got this much of the story without help from cops or anybody, including you. And I'll do it alone! I'll get the rest of the story. I don't want your lousy raise! I don't want any part of you! I'll get the story and get out and I hope I never see you or your paper or this stinking waterfront again! That's the stuff, Joe! Now you are fired. Hey, how much rent do you pay for this place? Oh, get out, will you? No, I'm just getting in. You're getting out. But before you go, speak to Phelps about me for your job. Oh, you can have it. You can have this place. You can have anything connected with the waterfront I've got. You mean you're really going? Yeah, going just as far as I possibly can and try to forget what a mess I've made of things, particularly myself. Well, in that case, I'll give you this. I opened it. Well, what does it say? It's from Brattleboro, Vermont. "Joe, dear, since you are the dearest friend I have," stop. "I want you to be the first to know I am engaged to Walden Morgan," stop. "Affectionately, Bernice." It's a tough break, kid. I'm sorry. Oh, you don't have to be. I wasn't in love with her. Oh? No, it was just one of those things. That was a great story. Yeah, tough break on Julie. That was a great story. Yeah, tough break on Julie. She believed in me. Listen, call Phelps and tell him you're sick. I'll finish the story. No, I can't stop now, Mac, you ought to know that. I'll finish the story. No, I can't stop now, Mac, you ought to know that. I'll finish the story. No, I can't stop now, Mac, you ought to know that. It's a great story. I wish I'd done it. And I wish you had. I wish I'd done it. And I wish you had. I wish anybody in the world had done it but me. [ Cat meowing ] Well, "meow" yourself. Come on. Well, come on. [ Meows ] Hello, there. Hello, there. [ Meows ] Say, I got a job for you. Yes. How would you like to sit beside a fireplace, huh? Oh, just the warmest, coziest fireplace you ever saw. Now, look, isn't that good? Miss Kirk! What do you want? You come. Your father hurt bad. He say get doctor. Doctor? What's happened to him? What happened to him? [ Train whistle blows ] I brought you the doctor, Eli. How does it look, Doc? I shall have to remove the bullet. Have you got the tools? Yes, but I have no anesthetic. Well, I have plenty of that. Go on and get started. Let's have done with it. Make a light for me. There it is. How did it happen? That black-legged reporter put the police onto me and they caught me with the goods. What reporter? Miller. What reporter? Miller. Miller? Yes, Miller. Somebody tipped him off where I was gonna land the stuff tonight. Somebody did. I'm going to get across the border. Get me a motorboat. Yeah. Don't you worry. I'll take care of all that. We've both got to get out of here. You can't go with me, Julie. Oh, I've got to, Eli. I can't stay here. Why? Why? I... I trusted somebody. I thought I was in love. Love? Yeah, I made a mistake. Love? Yeah, I made a mistake. Who is he? Nobody. Nobody that matters. You've always told me everything. It's one thing I can't ever tell you. Light a little closer. This may hurt. You hold still. Hold it! There. It looks kind of like a cross, don't it? Give it to me. Might come in handy later on. No. No, he's gonna be alright, isn't he, doctor? Chances are not good. for going in boat. If I can get up that ladder, I'm going tonight. Must go very easy. You have hemorrhage. You die. No, no, no. No, you won't. You won't, Eli. You just lie quiet. We'll get away alright. You get that boat ready. Yeah. Get in provisions enough for four days. You be quiet now and don't worry. [ Knock on door ] [ Door closes ] Julie, I... What do you want? Julie, I... What do you want? I want to tell you something. Tell me nothing. You told me. You don't like the waterfront. Things don't grow here! No, not like you they don't! Maybe not. But I'm sorry I had to drag you in. Me? Never mind about me! It's him! No, it isn't. That's my job, and he had it coming to him. It's you! I loved you. I didn't know it, but I know it now. You love me? Oh! You just went after me to get my father! That's why you're here now. You think I know where he is and you think they'll find him. They will. But I came here to get one thing clear in your head. Last night was on the level. I loved you, and I'll always love you. Don't talk about love. You've been digging around the muck of the waterfront so long, nothing means anything to you but your dirty job! You think you're gonna find Eli? Well, try it. If you do, they'll find you dead in the harbor. Oh, for goodness... Yeah, and that'll be okay with me, too. Oh, for goodness... Yeah, and that'll be okay with me, too. Now get out of here. [ Laughs quietly ] I guess you lost your job. [ Boat horn sounds ] [ Gunshot ] How does that feel? Kind of hot. You don't shoot as straight as you spit. Straight enough. You'll never write no more stories about me. Oh yes, I will. I'll still write your obituary. No, you won't. I'll be over the border by sunrise. [ Coughing ] Yeah, but not the Mexican border. [ Chuckles ] You're pretty game, ain't you? You just won't quit, will you? Not till I'm through. Come on, Eli. I've got the boat. Eli. Eli, are you alright? Sure. What's the matter with him? I shot him. You shot him? He had it coming to him. He's right, Julie. I gave you a pretty raw deal. Is he the man? Yeah. No, no, Eli. You can't do that. What's the use? Come on. Come on, we've got to get away. You'll never make it, okay? You can't even get up those... [ Strained ] ...stairs. We can't leave him, Eli. If nobody came, he... he might die here. I can't leave him. Joe: Where are we going? None of your business. Come on. Eli, you got twisted in the fog. We're back home! Take her outside, you made a mistake. No mistake. Not this time. Get a doctor to get that bullet out of the kid there. You did it on purpose. If you love him, he's worth it. It's more than I ever was. Eli! It's more than I ever was. Eli! Eli! Oh, no!
