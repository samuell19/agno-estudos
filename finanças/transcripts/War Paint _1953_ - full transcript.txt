Jim! Kirby! Kirby! MY EYES ! MY eves! Can you hear me, Mr' Kirby? - YES, Jim! - Mr. Kirby, please! Don't let that Indian get me“. When we get back to the Fort, Mr. Clancy, I'm thinking of quitting the cavalry. - What cavalry, Mr. Allison? - The cavalry with its foot soldiers. What's a horse, Mr. Allison? A horse is a mule Just a llttle taller. What is an officer, Mr. Allison? An officer is three words on a stick. Shut up ! YOU KNOW what I mean! Silence now until the patrol reaches the Fort. What do you see In your telescope? Looks like a soldier, sir. - Rest your men, sergeant. Down on the ground! Considering his way of riding.“ Looks like the braves of Gray Sky are on his heels. It's Grady, the ladies' man' It's Private Grady from the Fort. - You think... - I don't know, sergeant. The Fort ain't supposed to come to us with help during the patrol. Hopefully everything goes well' That's all I ask. Oh, you're not the first soldier that has a baby! That's what YOU think! Tonight you will kiss your wife, your baby... You'll have a drink, everything will be fine. You are going to make a good father! A message from the Major, sir! Thanks Grady, is everything okay at the Fort? Calm as an assignment In Washington, sir! Grady! Grady! Do you have any news from Emilie for me? - Emily? - Perkins' wife Is expecting a baby. Oh, I heard about that. - $0 what? - The baby? A 4 kg boy, and Emllie is fine. You are lucky to have a boy. - You're not going to see him right away. - And why ? Because I was myself busy last night... with Bonnie McNeal. The daughter of the orderly of the commander' she told me this patrol was going return to the counter and wait. Oh no, we're going back where we came from' - It's always the chore memes' - That's enough! If you had plans for tonight, forget them. We're not going to ride in the sun. But we did our patrol today. Are there no soldiers other than us? Then we oughta be proud. Lieutenant Billings gets all the cool Jobs. For his glory, guvs! I'll tell you, Talson. To judge an ofificer, you count the times you got out alive. You are alive! Mount up! Whenever you want Lieutenant. You are sure that my glorious companions are ready? By the way Corporal, I almost forgot. Bonnie sends you her love. The one she gave me last night and that I pass on to you. If you don't need me, I could return to the Fort? - I can't allow this. - Not even this time ? It's not a matter of once. the patrol must remain together. If it can comfort you... You can tell your son about this expedition when he grows up. Look at this paper, a treaty expected by Chief Gray Cloud. It gives him all for peace that we all want. Commissioner Kirby was to deliver this from Washington. NOW he'll take it to the trading post to give to Gray Cloud. And soon, after that. there won't be any more patrols. You will have time for your son. I will be thinking of you guvs drinking my beer. That's enough soldier you stay with us! WHO? ME? Get On Your horse Grady! - Go ahead, Sergeant! - Ahead! Sergeant, tie up the horses under trees. Grady, Allison, go to the well. Corporal Hamilton, make up the list of our needs. Tolson, Clancy, Martin help unload the pack animals. - YOU can break ranks! - Break ranks! Hi! I SEW YOU coming, it has been a while since we've seen anything like It. What news from Kirby? He was there with his escort last month. What can I do for you ? We need supplies, give him the list Sergeant. You haven't heard from Kirby fora month? NO, but I heard that the chiefs were talking about war again. - What is YOU!' opinion, Lieutenant? - There Will be peace. If Gray Cloud receives his treatv before the 24th. ThiS is what day Of thew month? The 2nd, the 3rd? We are On the 15th. We are losing track of time here. The only thing we recognize time ls the wars. You say we are on the 15th. If Gray Cloud doesn't have thiS treaty In 9 days... - There Will Still be fighting! - Hey Will have It! Lieutenant! This Indian, if we give him tobacco, he could help us. He doesn't work on tobacco, Sergeant. This is Taslik, Gray Cloud's son. Taslik, these men asking about a friend of your father's. Commissioner Kirby, you've seen mm 7 A long time ago he came to see my people. We have an important document for your father. Cray cloud has been waiting. How many days ride to Gray cloud's village? Six days. It leaves us little time to deliver the treaty. If Kirby isn't here tomorrow morning, We'll ride out to meet him. - Get provisions ready. - Yes sir! Taslik! If we go to the village of your father, we will need your help. I'll show you the trail' An independent guy, right? He's an Indian, one day he will be Chief. You see Martin, all we live for Is the big moment. The moment when we finally take what we want. Why are you in the army? To pass time. I don't believe that Kirby will make his appearance. We will leave tomorrow morning. - I'll tell the guys' - Tomorrow will be enough! Your wife is coming back soon? NO. Sergeant, the Lieutenants wife will not Come-. She would like the Lieutenant to Join her In the east. A transfer? I haven't asked for it vet. It would seem this is no life for a woman. There is plenty of them at the Fort, Sir'. Apparently not like this one' sorry, Lieutenant' Me too. Something to sleep on it, isn't it? Good night, sergeant. Good night sir. We talk a lot about war In your father's village? You will ask Kirby. One son is like a soup of noodles with only one noodle. In Poland, a man has 10 or 15 sons. Why did you leave Poland, charnofsky? I was stuck in the army. A simple detachment' To give a niece of paper to the commissioner. What I would like to KNOW IS where is it? The Lieutenant says we'll see Kirby In a few hours. Ah, {his Lieutenant! He would love to gallop towards Gray cloud to deliver the treaty hlmself. This Indian has war paint, I know It when I see It. You are sure you haven't found any whisky at the trading post? NO, and I didn't search! - War paint, if I were... - No need to wait! Let the men rest, Sergeant. No water for the horses. Corporal, bring your maps. No sign Of life. Sir, if you have things to do at the Fort, I can lead the detachment. Taslik! It's been a week since we've been gone and no trace of Kirby. I hope you are right about that water. The spring is behind the next hill. Tomorrow we will have water. Taslik! - Are these war paintings? --Yes. What for? It's about the warriors I killed. Those who violated the hunting grounds of my people. Why these war paintings, there ls no war? You wear good clothes of war! You wonder what it's for ? A weapon? It's like a telescope' It allows me to draw a map. The next time we come back we won't need a guide. Take cover! Help me hold them' Ah, that stupid soldier! Grady, give me a hand. What's that for? For those WHO attack US. - It was nothing. Jolson! We hit it! We Will be rich! Look, gold! - How much is it worth? - shut your mouth ! Fake gold! It's worthless ! YOU heard if! Go on! Let's go! Hey Perkins, that's special. In Poland, when a child arrives... we roast a sheep, have a big party! It's not a sheep but it will be fine. - What is that thing ? - Pepper, With enough pepper'... everything has the taste of mutton' Oh, take it easy, Charnofsky! But Sergeant, that's what makes good meat. It makes you thirsty too' And she says, I did not hear anything! BUt I say, Yes, it was her father. Stop your gossip YOU heard me ! Leave Bonnie alone! Calm down, corporal, he wasn't talking about Bonnie. And if I spoke about it? She has nothing to do with you' 'cause I'm gonna marry her in the end of my time, next year. Well. I'll finish in 2 years. YOU don't want to deprive me OF thiS pleasure! -I'm going to smash your head! -come on, what's going on? A simple sable practice, sir! Save your strength. - Put away your weapons' --Yes sir! A marry, Charnofsky? Yes, I have prepared a mutton for you' I could be at dinner with my wife, sir. She's waiting for you, right? She Will always be there when YOU come back. - Oh, when are we getting home sir? -when we know about the treaty. Do you want war with the Indians? - Mo! - Then do your Job. Let me explain something to you' you know there are only 2 mistakes a man can make with a woman. Ask too soon and she says yes. Or ask too late and she says no. YOU have to be smart enough to find the right time. So take your time' I guess ifs my fault, Lieutenant. I shouldn't have stacked the supplies here. We'll have water tomorrow. We ration ourselves until we'll be at the spring. YES SIT. Give me a hand. Here is the spring! As expected ! It dried faster than expected. IS there water around? One, maybe two days on horseback. We're going to be a little thirsty. The spring is dry. Report to sergeant Clarke what you have left. Drink only the minimum. I'm so thirsty that I could drink... Charnofsky, you are demonic' -I'm Polish, not demonic! - You and your pepper! - A SUIT Of“! With your food you made us empty our cans. We'll see what water we have left. GIVE me 3 match. Don't say anything to the others. There's enough left to go back to the post sir. If it was up to me, we'd be 2000 miles away from here. We have one week left to deliver the treaty to Gray cloud. Kirby is out there somewhere. There must be water in front of U5. I think of the men Lieutenant, I vote for going back. - That is if I get a vote! - You don't, we're following the Indian. YES SIT! What fell down there? My gear, sir! Haven't you learned how to pack, corporal. What happened Y I do not know sir. - I checked everything this morning' -what about your mans? GONE SIT. Lieutenant! It didn't tear, it looks like a knifecut. We have no choice. Sergeant. Taslik is the only one who can lead us to Gray cloud. WithOUt water, HE'S as dead as we are. 5o figure that tie just broke! - What? - Watch him from now on. Watch him good. Corporal, you want Bonnie so bad I'll make a deal with you. If you give me some water, I don't bother you anymore. Talisk better KNOWS where the water IS. I know where it is! We started the last barrel this morning, It Is almost empty. Are we sure that we have nothing else left. Oh, what I'd like to drink, It's whiskey! Follow me all! Lieutenant Ritchie Harper! He was with Kirby! - Probably run out of water! - l think SO. They wouldn't have had the strength to bury them. Taslik! How long ago do you think this happened? Three weeks. Maybe Kirby failed to see Gray cloud also. It is better to get used to the idea. We'll go straight to the village of Gray cloud. If you don't like it. Remember that some of you have family at the Fort. All of you have friends' If Gray Cloud doesn't have the treaty wlthin 6 days, pray for them From here on out we're acting alone. Get rid of all your excess equipment' Alright! Keen only the guns, blankets and canteens. They keep their swords, sergeant, they are still soldiers. YES SIT. This tin soldier can feel the Captain's bar's already. Hey, has anyone seen my accordion? - You and your music! - I'll lose It! Good, it Will rot on the track as we all Will. Smartass There is a water hole behind that. LETS go back to the hills, we will have water tomorrow. I wonder what we do with this indian. The horses! The horses! The horses are running away! - What about it Taslik? - MY horse also ran away! First the water can! Then, the dry spring! After the material sabotaged! Now the horses! War paint! Up! I won't miss! He tries to kill us. NOW YOU! Why? Why all Of thiS? You have 5 seconds to talk or you deal with them. Gray cloud will never accept your treatv of lies. We give him everything he asked for. He will never see the white man's paper of lies. What more does he want? My people can safe themselves only If they band together to fight the Whlte man. My father believes in the honor of the white man. But I know that you will forget the treaty as soon as you don't need us anymore. And when we're starving, you will tell us to eat grass' l am Gray Cloud's son, but I don't trust In the whites. Like Kirby? - -Yes. I Will deliver thiS treaty with or without you. YOU can die here OF come and SHOW US where the water IS. - Are you crazy! - Do you know where the water Is? - With him, we'll all stay there! -l'm still In charge! What shall it be, death OI' water? Watch the water ! Like we didn't watch It close enough. We haven't got anything out of that cask. The cask has been leaking for days. Thank him! A snake ! Thanks Lieutenant! It's not necessary, Lieutenant' But -Yes, sergeant. What do you want? One man alive or two dead from thirst! All right, we're leaving. I read a bunch Of books on people's humanity. They have it all wrong! When we get back, I'll write one' You made us go round in circles. All of you 118311 SOON. You might find some water as easlly as you can shoot. We follow this direction. Lieutenant! Lieutenant, Hamilton won't last a longtime. Neither do the others. - My blood turns to sand! -we're all dried up! There must be water somewhere! Sergeant. Sergeant, take a look! YOU SSE? Smoke! Gray cloud! It can only be him! It's not that far. A short walk. Thank you sir! We will never get there. Not all! Not like this! He's right, Lieutenant' One man, then. With enough water to travel fast, he can help us. - I better go, then. - Thanks. I want you to stay with me, sergeant. 50 WHO'S it gonna be? I am in good shape. Give me your canteen, Martin' - Ah, I've had enough! - It's an order! If you don't make it, we won": make It! What are we going to do, drink rocks? That's right! It won't make any difference, anyway. Give this treaty to Gray Cloud. Tell him that's what he wanted. -L won't be long! - We'll follow you when It's cooler. Good luck, sergeant' Good luck Clancy! So long Clancy! Be careful, don't drink too much. Perkins! Wait! Let me drink! - The water may be bad. - Lieutenant! Could be Kirby's group. Nobody else ever came to this region. Could have died of anything' If it was poisoned, there would be more skeletons. Maybe the rest didn't drink. I prefer to be careful' Maybe the water is good after all. WE will SOON find out. - Grady! --Yes sir! Look around if you find bullets, arrows, something. YES SIT. I Will not die Of thirst. What is wrong? Nothing. What do you all have? The water is good' - A little bitter, perhaps. - of course. Lieutenant, no arrows, nothing. - shut up! Everything is fine' Everything is fine, I tell you! The poison! Don't drink! My stomach! Clancy's coming back tomorrow? The Indians know how to cure this thing. Don't they, Lieutenant? Tomorrow everything will be fine! My son, I have something that I want to tell you. When we took the treaty, you were still very small, just a baby' we brought the treaty to Gray cloud. We haven't seen it. If only we could be heard. We were thirsty. I wanted to tell YOU. What is it? I heard something. You are crazy! There is something! over there! What is that? An Indian ! Lieutenant, Lieutenant! - It's a girl. - I am not blind. Wait till Grady sees her. What is happening? A bullet wound, it looks like. - Do you understand our language? - some water! Ask him where the water is! - An Indian does not travel alone. - Everything in its time. WY CO get up, WE mean YOU HO harm. She understood! WE need water. Let's go on. We'll take her with us. She can drink our water. Anything we don't have. What is she doing here? Stop! Clancy, he's dead! It's not an indian who did that. he still has his scalp. Empty! He must have fired before... Bring her here. Who are you? Why did YOU kill him? Tolson ! Light a match. Closer. Closer. Burn her! She knows where the water is. - Burn her eves! -who are you? Wanima! Taslik's sister! Why did YOU kill him? Why does the whiteman bring lies to Gray cloud? She's been following us ever slnce we left the trading post. The landslide. the horses! Cray cloud wants that treaty bad. Without it, they wouldn't have tried to stop us. - We should kill you' - And why not? She killed Clancy. We still have three days for this treaty. If war don't arrive in time, she will be living proof we want peace. Help! Help me! Don't let them have me! Help me! I am sorry' water, he has to have water'! Leave it to me, SHE Will tell us where the water IS! Lieutenant soon. we all go to be like Hamilton. He can't go on, Lieutenant. We only have two more days. Go ahead, I'll catch up. - WHO is it? WhO'S there? - Alllison! I buried him' Three dead! Where is Billings? Hamilton didn't have to die. NO one is forced to die. Only Indians! Taslik died as he fought, "like 3 coyote. I'm talking about my people, not my brother. WHO MOURNS US? We offer YOU peace, here in this paper. Peace! - The war is in your heart. -why do you say that? Listen to me, soldier. I know that peace you boast of. Before. my people were conquerors. When I was little. they spoke of bravery and glory. The bravery of battle and the glory of death. When they made peace It was their peace. In their hearts, there was only war. This peace is what your father wants. YOU! YOU have 3 woman? Does she believe everything you believe? No! 50 YOU must hate her as YOU hate me. 5he's a woman. NOt a murderer. She didn't kill anyone. So ask her for water! I fight because I'm a woman. Without mercy! I learned pity in your schools! And with your soldiers! I will never cleanse myself of them! You will never see your woman again. I will do what I came to GO. I will make peace! Yes! Your great white leader wrote in this paper: "this is my world'. "I'll send my soldiers with the paper." "sign! it is there you wish' But it's not the world of his people. Soon other white people will spit on this paper when we are weak. What will our rights be when our babies won't have any more milk? Soon we'll be nut in a corner, we won't be worth anything anymore. - Water? - NO water' ! Only yellow metal. GUM? Well, they wouldn't have left It lying around! Could YOU drink it if they did? Take a look. make sure there Is no water! THOSE WhO worked in thiS mine must have water from somewhere. - Let's take a look! - Allison! JUSt ONCE before I die I wanna be rich. She wouldn't bring us here lf there was water. Dry as bones! There is nothing here! What is a mine doing In this country? The Spaniards came long ago. - MY people killed them! - Why? Because the madness Of the Whites brings death. For a glass of water, I would give all that gold. Gold! where? GOld! LOOK at this! - It's gold! - A big deposit! You will make your dream come true Grady, you will die rich! GOld! I Will not die! Oh no, not now! Calm down! Stop it! Where is it? Where is it? Tell me! Tell me where the water is! Where is if? Where is it? I told you I wanted her alive. You have all gone mad! Wanting water is madness? No one will stun her from telling us where It ls. I said we'll bring her to Gray cloud to show him that we want peace. Put down that gun! I know it's hard but leave the girl alone. We just want to get out Lieutenant. - Take her Grady! - No, I don't take you to water. He will die alone for that niece of paper! I know he won't get what he wants. But I will not see him die. You're Still the chief, tell 'em to follow me, I'll take you. Alright, what's done is done' AS SOON as Clarke returns, we leave! Oh what did I tell YOU! I knew she knew! NOW, we are no longer afraid OF anything. YES. him! I'm going to get some water all over'! I didn't think that it could be better than a woman. Sir', about the shooting this afternoon, I'm sorry, I wasn't In normal condition. I said what's done Is done, Allison. Thank you, Lieutenant. What do you think our lives will be worth back at the Fort? Mutiny, insubordination, attacking an officer. The Lieutenant said he would not charge Tolson. What else could he say? I didn't shoot him. You can tell the court martial you Just pointed your gun at him. I thought about thiS? There is a whole gold mine out there waiting for us. With an ore like thiS. each Of US can earn 3 Fortune. Yes! - If Billings is gone! -what are you saying? We can be rich and heroes too. We deliver the treaty, we return to the Fort and we tell our own story. Sure, why not' No, the Lieutenant is a good man! - shut up! Lieutenant, help! - Let's get the rest of them! - No! Let them sleep. Let's hide it! Alright, I'll go go to bed, sir! Tomorrow, Gray Cloud! - Tomorrow! - Good night sir! Good night, sergeant. YOU found US the water. But you still don't believe we want to help your people. Not everyone is like you. I do not KNOW. I don't know what I am like. Somebody who knew me well said I was all soldier, all job. She hated that! - Your' woman? - yes. She's at the Fort? That's why you're afraid of the war? No, she's far away' One day she said she WES SICK to death Of the killings. All these killings, on both sides. She said I'll be killed COO. - She went away. - And YOU? I was angry, I did not understand. I understand HOW. When I get back. I think we can work things out. Then she will be happy' How will you feel when Gray cloud will get his treaty? I will go with you to the village. But our thoughts are as different as earth and water. We better get some sleep' - Grady? - Eh ? Grady, it's your turn! - Everything alright? - Yes, take care of the fire. - I told you to take up arms. - How could I? - Allison! - Tolson! - Grady! - My people do not attack at night. No, it's one of ours. They must have got Allison. Over!" there! Let's go to the other side of the spring, we will block them! They might be on top' Perkins! Thomson! Over!' here! They are over there! All of them! Grab the girl and run! This party is for enlisted men only! GO ahead! I've got you covered from here. Grady! - Where are they ? - over there. - They had to leave. -we stay together! - How are we going to get out of this? - Keep a cool head. You stay here and cover for me' You are losing blood. It'll be alright. Take her and go see Gray Cloud' - And I leave you alone? - only two of them left. - Here, I control the situation. - I'm afraid not. USCG“ mister. For treaty of yours, I almost died Of thirst. Gone crazy with the heat. They Shot me, tried to Kill me and I wanted CO leave. Stop arguing and go! We'll see you in the village, sergeant. Tell them to keep the soup warm. Drums of war! They...
