[Music] 20 bucks mate how about your ship captain do we charter we that's right captain wait he's not fit for your kind mesh nothing but a floating Pigpen no Pelican is the best whale animal ship on the high seas but he's right there's nothing but a floating Pigpen it's just a small dirty Tramp fitted up with iron cages to bring back wild animals well it's not exactly the kind of a ship that you'd want for a honeymoon trip Ron guess captain we don't intend to be married until we get back fact is I'm about to go into the wild animal business myself well it's the greatest game in the world I've been hunting them and transporting them since I was a boy but you don't stack up to me like the kind of a fella that I'd send after wild animals well these animals may not be wild in fact they may not be alive you see they've been dead for millions of years and I thought you were jungle fever oh I see you mean the fossil bones of extinct beasts the skeletons of the big boys like the giant prata soros and flesh-eating Tyrannosaurus museum stuff here's to you captain I see you know something about you a fairly intelligent that means prehistoric animals thanks I went to school too that's very interesting captain then you will trot us your ship well I never thought much about letting a woman sail with us before now look I'll take you to animals you never dreamed existed the last specimens of gigantic creatures that roamed the earth before a man came into existence a minute ago you were talking about skeletons now all of a sudden they come alive he's fatty another little joker what other Joker never mind about that is he gonna have to tell me a little more about this deal if we want a ship darling I guess you'll have to all right I'll give it to you in tabloid form I was a navy fly in the South Pacific during the war they sent me out on a solo mission scouting some Jap base I caught in a typhoon blown off my course I flew over hundreds of small uncharted islands on one of these islands I saw things live things three times the size of army tanks did the Navy investigate and ever reported what I saw why should I those things had nothing to do with the war sighs they might think I was suffering from battle fatigue that's what half cut up will you go ahead husband I'm positive they were the last living descendants of prehistoric monsters practically unknown to modern civilization you think you can find his island again I'm sure of it how big is it roughly about ten miles squared but it was none of the usual coral atolls found in that particular area the Pacific this island had mountains and deep jungle valleys parts of it were barren too I believe it was the remaining tip of a vast continent that gradually sank into the sea ages ago such matters I called no man a liar new islands are rising and old ones are sinking in the South Seas even a day I've seen with my own eyes things you wouldn't believe yeah take a look at this picture I shot it from the plane that looks like a large animal but it could be a rock formation or a big shadow or it might even be exactly what you claim it is if Newt I tell you you've walked a rather in it water like some gigantic hideous sort of lizard I'm sure Ted's right captain sure but a thing like this takes money lots of money I'm prepared to pay any price your name kept I'll deposit it to your account before we sail oh so that's the way it is huh now wait a minute I've got nothing to hide miss lane is financing this expedition for me but I'll repay it ten times over from the proceeds of what will be the most sensational animal hunt on earth all I'm interested in is the scientific aspects of the discovery is that clear enough for you quite clear and quite agreeable mr. Osmond if Fairbanks bring him in here well that finally at the bar behind a bottle of rum is usually nice now wait a minute wait a minute I don't want any strangers in on this who's Fairbanks well he's a man is Sanderson was trying to tell you about you have a lot in common you flew over this island he's been on it that's impossible that's what I thought too at first but his story confirms yours yours confirms his but if he's really been there why hasn't he well you see he's not exactly crazy but too much Sun as scramblers brains we picked him up about a year ago off a life raft he was nothing but skin and balls delirious and raving about horrible animals as big as houses what a pity he's been trying to blot that stuff out of his memory ever since but drinking himself to death Fairbanks is he an American tax captain in the Marines we ought to do something for him well if he's actually been on this island and what he says is true we got to take him along with us he might come in handy that's what I figured how did he ever find it he didn't it found him it seems that he and four or five of his pals brought a sloop after the war we're gonna take a pleasure cruise around to some of the islands they see action aah typhoon boom over there course - then I got caught in some kind of a mysterious cur that beast him and smash the boat the bits on this island yeah go ahead and get it then what well that's about all we can ever get out of him except that he's the only one that ever came back that's why up hi ranks [Music] Devon Kanaskie wants to see you who's Captain Turner asking what's the matter enough though come on the capital buy you a drink drink why didn't you say so a pleasure to drink was Captain Turner see who is he come on hello Fairbanks have a drink [Music] mr. Fairbanks once you sit down I'm Caroline and this is Ted Osmond [Music] mr. Fairbanks a captain tarnowska tells me that we're going back to that island Fairbanks back to find the beasts that chewed up your pals while they were still alive and kicking you want to come along blow my brains out first or I'd go back to that well you still think you want to go what about it tear my mind's made up but I don't think you ought to go cow my mind's made up to when can we sail captain I could be ready to sail by tomorrow midnight alright we'll have our luggage and equipment put aboard the ship oh one thing more the money will meet you at the bank tomorrow good enough what about mr. Fairbanks oh I think I can persuade him to change his mind certainly hope so well here's to a successful trip and a pleasant [Music] see in the bank in the morning right what kind of a crazy deal with you get a center that ain't so crazy a woman like that don't happen every day sometimes I think you're correct working Fairbanks you [Music] sale I want him aboard [Music] pretty boys up the chat house let me change course again ten degrees south or southeast all right let him take care of an empty since we got to reach the atom about three or four days good don't want to nobody ever ran in this out of the floor we're a hundred miles off any shipping lane [Music] you better forget the daemon we might never reach that island what's the matter with you what's on your mind muttering ever since we veered off the body over they know we have no legitimate business needs waters I got a strong flesh they cook it up something people go check out until we get there once we reach the island there's nothing I can do about it [Music] sneak up on here before you know it well put hobnail boots on them you're the first manager the wind seems to be getting stronger yeah we might have a little glow nothing much so Ted says we should reach the island in a few days that's right I mean so much to they recognition everything he's ever wanted we're so happy for - no captain confidentially I'll be glad when the trips alone we'll all be glad oh by the way captain ten months to tell the crew that there's a bonus for every animals everyone nobody tells my crew anything except me I understand well I see you've decided to get prettied up you're gonna finally come out on deck how are you and your brother rat you want a drink no thanks you made me allergic to Mickey Finn's that's known as that ternasky cure you're a pretty tough patient but someday you're gonna thank me for talking into this trip you're beginning to look like a new man well almost a man I know anything to happen to you before reach the island I'm gonna need you if we ever reach it we'll reach it alright we're almost there now snooping is not part of your duties on a ship go to my cabin I get my glasses hi crew doesn't know where we're going in my crew goes where I tell him they don't ask questions they ever start asking them it might be embarrassing not that it makes any difference to me it's quicker having your throat cut by Alaska's knife than be crushed by a monster you don't even see or hear until a shadow as big as a mountain floor shut up what's the matter our friend here is still got the jitters this ship seems for that Island that filled the hearts of our fathers with fear the taboo Island rising out of the sea the home of monsters that are forbidden to even look upon cowards submitting les coeurs never ever look you brothers in my hand is the blade of justice if we die we must see the blood of our masters sigh you're right when shall it be when tonight named our later until then silence [Music] captain on deck pass to crow totally breakfast have you got here [Music] all right drop them what and you're soaked up over asleep you heard what I said drop him now me afraid matey they haven't got the nerve to start anything again because if they do they'll be shark bait before I'm a day older [Music] all the comforts of a luxury liner any objections no have you any idea when this draws beneath he's probably making out his last will and testament aren't you being facetious mr. Fairbanks it's easier that way keeps me from thinking too much you know I've been thinking I don't believe you've ever been on that island your run elucidation shall we call them we're probably nothing more than a king-sized case of the deep teas oh and what you want crazy fools dragging you along on a deal like this nobody dragged me and I'll thank you to mind you when you're a fool to land captain off the starboard bow that might be the island sounds like it let's have a look what is it have you actually cited it that's it Oh captain there's the island mind me what do you mean it might be the way I plotted this course it's gotta be lets us be well not banks any reefs offshore circle would be smashed to pieces if you try to go in better anchor offshore you can drop the hook there if you're still going through with it we're still going through ok it's your funeral mine too probably reduce speed half ahead ahead looks like pretty boy you must have really been in the Navy that's pretty rough country Jasper it can't be look at the laughter ridge captain things'll I move let me see [Music] what is a tip [Music] it's disappeared I couldn't see anything what was the what it look like look like something is see during a 10-day binge you just make a mouthful for that thing captain never seen anything yet I couldn't head on animal not human with your charm I don't wonder come on let's get the equipment in the boat Fairbanks to change your mind not going ashore but you are to Carol I have nothing to fear mr. Fairbanks after all there's some men going along Santa's in unit woods break out the equipment we're going ashore all right all right get a move on we haven't got all day hey you two get a handle those crates keep busy leaving you in charge of the ship you're gonna show us all right take it up Alaska Samantha bow that's it get that ladder over the side hey you up high get that lying down here come on move bullet whizzes nothing I shouldn't have said what I did I'm sorry apology unnecessary but accept it I do wish you'd change your mind about coming with us sir Ted was counting on you and I'd feel better about it - nice try but I should have recognized the approach you're in possible you better stop insulting people's on a ski let's catch it so the little lady's picking up my habits hey she'll learn a lot more before I'm through hope you've got heavier guns in that aboard I got guns big enough to knock down elephants cordite Sheldon grenades - changed my mind I think I'll go along I want to hear you when you start screaming harder steady [Music] Curly's tracks of dinosaurs well they come down to the beach occasionally you know that might be what you saw from the ship how far into the other animals about half a mile not enough food near the water to attract them their flesh eaters and roam or in the open more barren spots I've never seen them near the beach though you want to see them you'll have to go find them it won't come to you the exception of that hairy monster I was telling you about he'll look us up once he gets the scent oh that's a charming thought about the boat skipper Edwards when you finish unloading stand by the boat shoot anybody that tries to leave the island without orders from me hiya captain you think the last cos he'll try I don't think they will but I won't take any chances well let's go yeah banks lead away we'd have to find a spot to make camp that is thing closed swamp all over the place all right [Music] over there why are they giant dinosaurs 75 feet long is there an inch as high as a two-story building and of millions of years ago some of the weighed over 20 tons where you'll have plenty of chances to photograph them handout us I guess you two didn't dream this up after all looks like we're gonna be in for a little excitement a Sanderson yeah it looks like it's gonna be a lot of fun okay Fairbanks let's go [Music] there you are my friends another unique little pepper in back Lizzy cute I was right we're gonna see things on this island that no other human being has ever seen look darling it's here they're real probably many others I never doubted you for a moment - shall we go on or do you two want to stay and tell each other how wonderful you are Fairfax is right let's keep moving [Music] leave a little slack in that line I think we'll need those things we could use field artillery I'm still not be sure make sure that thing is secure Ted I've got the strangest feeling like we were being watched just your imagination darling those beasts won't come near the camp I'll probably have to photograph them with a telescopic lens you know where the nearest water is yeah about a quarter of a mile over their eyes is a small spring is it safe sure keep out of the soft mud and tall grass come hi sir get yourself a boy get the water over that rise is a small spring ah try that again I'll put a book that textile yard now that's what I call a fine sense of humor [Music] [Applause] [Music] laughter horribly [Applause] [Music] [Music] the shitty Tyrannosaurus giant lizards [Music] [Applause] these guys won't do any good will even scare them away when we were back in Singapore one thing I can do [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] he's waiting until they attack us please get out [Applause] [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you're our leader what we do now already some of our come back dead one has been cleared by the dreaded monster we must get off this accursed Island but how we have got no gospel fight the devil is captain is more evil than the monster but we don't need any guns you are plan mr. Meg break out my dinner suit and crack open a bottle of champagne this ain't the kind of a place for that outfit miss maybe not but I thought it'd help me feel better I understand hmm you know you
