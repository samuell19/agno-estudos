My name is Doctor Victor Wolffenstein and this is my story. For thousands of years, man has longed for immortality. It's human nature to wish to overcome death. I found the formula for it. The formula for immortality. For ages I was preoccupied with occult rituals, that contributed to my researches and in the development of my serum. I tested on animals, and I even tested on humans, but all of my specimens died after being injected with the serum. Though not in vain... always for the cause of my research. All of this helped me to rectify the final fault in the structure of my serum. At least that's what I thought when I started a final test on myself. Initially, it seemed as if the serum would stop the aging process. But shortly after, my cells started to die off. It seemed I had infected myself with necrosis during the test. Day and night I worked on modifying the serum. I was forced to perform transplants on myself. I had to repeatedly steal the dead from the cemetery... to replace the dying parts of my body. They despise me for that. Me and my research. It's our faults that make us unique. But they consider me a murderer, a monster. And they are afraid of me. They called me a witcher and spat at me. They shall all pay for that. Hang that bastard! Burn the witcher! Rip his guts out! Hang the monster! Kill that bastard! Calm down, everyone. Just be quiet. I know, we have put up with this monster insulting our Lord for far too long. He plundered our cemetery and desecrated our families. He is a shame for this community. So I tell you my fellow citizens: We will make an end to this hall of shame. Together. Tonight, this devil will be punished for his evil doing. We'll make him bleed in the name of the Lord. Kill him! My research seems cursed, but I've worked for too long to give up on it now. I need to get out of here and resume my work someplace else. A place where they'll leave me in peace. But I'm running out of time. I need another self-experiment, and it's the only chance left. I have modified the serum, so it will enable me to... Go get him! I want to see his face. Your end has come, witcher. You'll forever burn in hell! Dirty scum! You will pay for this! I curse you! All of you! You shall live in eternal fear. From now until the end of your lives. You and all people. Silence, creature of hell. Your words are poisonous. Satan has possessed you. Thou that walk through the dark must look into the light! Shut up! In the name of our Lord, I command you... Your God is dead, priest! Enough! Cut the rotting tongue out of this devil's mouth... and bury this dog alive. Go on! Shut him up! Now you're doomed! And I saw a pale horse, and he who rode it was named Death... and hell followed him! Say, who are you texting all the time? Yeah you'd like to know huh? I know it's Tim, right? Maybe... Admit it. Man, it's just David. Oh, that David? You know a different David or what? Didn't think he was your type. Well he's actually quite cute. A little shy maybe, but I know how to get him at ease. And what about Tim? Hello? I fucked him twice and then I got rid of him, you know that. You're such a bitch. Hello? And you? - Take it back! - No! -Yes! -No! Ladies why did you start without me? You know I'm always game for this kind of shit. What? You want us both? Well, I mean if you... and Tina... if that's OK with you we could hang out... Haha you're so funny! My sexy Mike can't take a joke, eh? I really can't tell. Bad girls need to be punished and you were bad! No, no, not at all. Hey David messaged, he has a surprise for us. He's here. I think she has a crush on David. Her and David? Really? No shit? I didn't tell you... and don't you tell him. I swear, cross my heart and hope to die. David! Hi! Look what I have. No... you've got the tickets? - I've got the tickets! - You have the tickets... holy shit! People, we're going to the 'Rave of Summer' festival. Dude... no shit? No shit dude, I've got the tickets. - That's so cool? - Well done. - You're the best. - Great! Guys... wanna party? Shit... Dude, we're so damn late. Dude we gotta get up. Come on. Hurry up now! What's up? Fuck! Shit Jenny and Tina are on their way and they're bringing Emily. Your cousin Emily? Dude don't piss me off. That's not gonna happen. Come on - go ahead. You think it's not happening. Come on now... get on with it. Man, she doesn't know what's good for her. Dude, are you listening to me? Take a shower! Get ready! Okay, okay. Give me 5 minutes. We'll talk later about Emily, 0k? Fuck off. Stop rushing. Honestly... -Get Emily out of your head. Hey, I know you were a kinda role model after her parents' death. That was very cool of you. But? She got over it. Especially since you took such good care of her. That's great. But I think by now she's old enough to make her own decisions. And I think she has a little crush on me. Are you done blabbing? No. Even if you had feelings for Emily, which I honestly doubt considering your libido. Just forget it. I can't take this shit no more. Look around you and take what's available. What do you mean "available"? Other girls are waiting in line for you. What other girls do you mean? Promise me you won't tell anyone. Of course, man. I never told you. Now tell me. Okay...'Tina has a crush on you. What's that? I know I know. I couldn't believe it either. Stop jerking around 0k? Cut that shit. It's the truth. Totally reliable source. You mean Jenny or what? Yeah, who else? What else did she say? Nothing else. Come on man. You know I get horny just when the wind blows. Tell me. Really! Nothing else. Oh. I'm beginning to understand. You're telling me this shit about Tina to keep me away from your cousin Emily. Yeah right. Can we change the subject now? No, what do you think Emily would say... if she knew the kind of shit you're telling me? Stop pissing me off with this shit. The girls are here - so there. This ain't over yet. Yeah yeah... I want this solved. Okay. - Hey are you ready for the ultimate rave? - Yeah sure. What do you think? - Hi. - Hey Jenny! - You all right? - All's well. - I'm so glad you're joining us. - Thank you. - Mikey baby. - Well? Hi Emily. Hi. Rm amine. Oh well. Hey are you OK? All is cool. I'll put the stuff in the car. Okay. Get in the car bitches. The party is starting. All is cool? You tell me. All is cool. Cool. Hey... I want this solved, OK. Listen, I'm gonna tell you something... don't piss me off. Let's go! Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls: We're all set. Hold on and fasten your seat belts. Let's go! What do you think? Should we drive all night or not? Fuck... are you serious? Damn. Motherfucker. No worries. They're sleeping. If you keep it up, they're not waking up either. Wanna keep driving? Dunno, what do you think? We're good. Your call. I don't wanna stay in a motel. Then go on. Wake me up if you want me to drive. We should actually be on this road here. Yeah, I think you totally lost track since the last crossroad. It's been half an hour already. Hold on. We should reach a little village soon. Guys, Where are we? Ask the great navigator. Hey I've had enough. Why don't you look at the great map that you bought. And another thing, you dork... Fuck. Shit man. What was that? Fucking great. Just what we needed. I shit my pants. Yeah me too. Shit... keep cruising. Look there's a house over there. Maybe we'll make it to... I'm trying. Just great, guys. What are we doing now? Keep cool. Can't get any worse. Looks like a garage. Seems you're right for once. Look... Hey Gunnar... some dudes. What kind of creeps? They're not that bad, Tina. Well if they can't help us then... Hope you're right. Excuse me... our car broke down. Something wrong with the engine. There's a lot of smoke. Can you help us out? Nice ride. What's your miles per gallon? No clue. No clue, hehe... He's harmless. Then let's see what's wrong with the good thing. Oh no, no. Oh man, always the same shit with these crappy foreign cars. Too much modern nick-neck. Can't stop telling this... Best thing would be to scrap these things... and start making some useful quality cars again. But nobody listens to me. All you young people... you don't know shit about this. I can tell you the hell I want. You buy this shit and when it breaks down on your asses, you just cry and whine. No... I don't wanna hear that anymore. Makes me sick. You're probably thinking, 'let that old fart talk', but it's the truth. Nobody makes any good quality cars anymore. Eh, whatever... None of my business. Fuck what I think, eh? - Shit I have no signal. - You want to make a phone call? No thanks. Oh fuck that cell phone. Excuse me. Can I use the bathroom? Sure... follow me. Hey, Hello? You can't just go for a piss with that guy. Yes, I need to go since I woke up. Told you it can't get any worse. Open for fuck's sake. Piece of shit... Motherfucker... Here you are. Thank you. I'll see you later honey. You were really lucky. Just a burst oil tube. First I thought it was the head gasket... wouldn't have surprised me, this foreign piece of shit. OK... how long does it take to be repaired? Well not before tomorrow. A whole day for this damn oil tube? Slow down man. Your ride isn't the only one we need to take care of. If you don't like it, son, then get the fuck off my property. - No no that's absolutely OK. - Hey we've got 2 more days to drive. Are you aware? We drove all night. We're still on time. Yeah great. Just great. Hey everything's OK. David is right. We're really on time. Yeah, then repair the damn car. Benny! Benny, look out for Hank. Then get your asses over here and push the ride in front of the garage. Okay. And hurry up. Hey man. Can we spend the night somewhere? You got lucky. We've got 2 vacant rooms. If there's one thing they're good at, it's making burgers. Dude, that food was disgusting. And anyway, this place is just one shit hole. You think so? I don't know why you always have to complain about everything. I'm gonna use what they call a 'bathroom' here. Before the girls take over. Go ahead. Let me know when you're done. The girls were quicker... The water is cold. The shower is too small and well... Dude, are you serious? Hey guys. It's Jenny. Are you there? Fuck! Hi Jenny. Hey we're heading out. You coming? What's going on here? Here?...Nothing. Where is David? David? Wait! Hi Jenny. Oh my God. It's really not what it looks like. I... think I'd better leave you alone. - No no, wait honey. It's not my fault. - I don't care what pervert games you're playing. - Pervert games? I'm as shocked as you are. - It's OK. Hey wait. I enter the room and here he is, playing with his dick. Fuck it dude, you're a dead man. Stop. You're in for some shit. Back off, I said. Prepare... It's really not what it looks like. I'm gonna kill you. Kevin... Kevin may I bother you and ask you to wake up? You fuck, you psycho. I'm gonna rip your ass apart... you damned... My God, stop yelling and deescalate the situation. Do you know who this is? This is Miss Royce Reed. Miss Royce Reed! What are you doing with my Bella? Bella... Are you alright? This is totally unacceptable. You're not seriously starting about Emily again? After that embarrassing stunt you just did? Man, I apologized. Fuck that. Hey come on Mikey. It wasn't that bad. Go fuck yourself. I love you too. Hey, is all okay? We might wanna ask you that question... Haha very funny. Hey come over here. It's Okay. Hey. Hey. Everything cool with you two? So far so good. Sorry about that. I really fucked up. Oh nonsense... You looked really cute with your pants down. Just with my pants down? No you're really cute anyway. Good to hear. Yes... I'm coming. What can I do for you, darling? Is there some place to have fun in this beautiful village? Down in the village there is a disco... Just follow the road. It's not far. Thank you. You can't miss it. There is only one. Yes great. We'll find it, eh? Have a nice evening. Yes. Oh my God, did you see that? I can't believe it. We are all cursed. What did you say? The Curse of the Doctor... It was never broken. The curse of the doctor? As a child, my grandfather told me a story about him. Doctor Victor Wolffenstein. Loan still hear his voice when he said that name. He told me that they found dead bodies every day. Gruesome and mutilated dead bodies, maggots creeping all over. He cut his victims' body pans and sewed them on himself. He ripped out their intestines and devoured them. His totally sick mind made him do it. At least that's what most people believed. My grandfather knew what he really was. What? He was evil in person. A demon. Cursed and possessed by the devil himself. The village people buried him alive. They thought that his evil soul would be forever trapped below the ground. But he cursed us all. My grandfather knew the evil couldn't be stopped. The Curse of the Doctor was never broken. He will poison your minds. You'll see... - God Mike! - You wanna root here or what? Come on. You will see... Pumpkin? Pumpkin? Dammit. Pumpkin? Pumpkin? Man, where's that fucking dog? Benny? Benny? Oh, kiss my ass. Pumpkin? Pumpkin? Pumpkin? Pumpkin? What are you doing there, my boy? God what is... what is that? Get the fuck out of here! Fucking dog. Gunnar? Gunnar? Pumpkin? Pump? Where is that guy? Pump? Gunnar? Pump? Pumpkin? What the hell? Ready for the next round? To a nice evening ladies and gentlemen. Cheers! Cheers! Bitches... now let's dance. Hola Sweetie. What can I get you? A beer please. Yup. Here you go. That's 4.50... Keep the change. Thank you. Thanks. - Hey. - Hey. How's it going? Okay. I need a few minutes. We might be in the boondocks, but this place is rather cool. Yeah it rocks. Come on, do it. What? Emily. I saw how you're always looking at her. Honestly, I already knew. There's no-one better than you. No shit? Are you serious? No I'm kidding. Now move, before I change my mind. Alright. Take good care of her. Hey man you know you can count on me. Hey. Pity. I would have loved to suck him. You're just a... I know I'm a bitch. Excuse me. You Pig! What do you want? Hey there you are. Hey. Everything alright, baby? Ready for the next round? No I'm tired. I'm going home. What? Already? You really don't look well. Oh that's just the alcohol. See you tomorrow. Hey wait. Leave him. He's wasted. Wasted? He's always the last to leave. Well today he's the first. Cheers. - Cheers. - Cheers. Hey sleepyhead. Finally awake? I tried to wake you an hour ago. Is everything okay? I've felt better. The car is ready. Come on then. We wanna leave. Give me a couple of minutes, 0k? All right, see you soon. Just stop honking. My head is exploding. Leave me alone. It was a real nice evening yesterday. I thought so too. That was just the beginning. The party is just starting, girls. Hey Mike. Hey. So, do you feel better? You looked awful yesterday. Everything's OK... All is good. The thing with Emily? Are you cool? Yes sure. Okay cool. Let's go. Could this be road here? Look! No forget it. Nothing's right here. All is okay. Oh yeah? Where the hell are we then? Here maybe? This could be right? Well if we drove through there, we should just about be here. No I think you forgot this crossroad here. Great! This is getting nowhere. Oh fuck. Guys, I told you we're totally wrong. Hey? We're there. Sure Mike. Look around. Right in the middle of nowhere. We ain't fucking anywhere. Darling... Are you okay? Mike? Hey wait. What the hell... Mike! Mike! Hey! Cut the shit. Stop. Please. Leave her alone Mike. Mike... hey? Stop it! Stop it! Stop it, please! Stop it!...Stop it! David, David please wake up. David please wake up. Thank God. David, thank God. Are you 0k? Yeah I'm alright. Is it very bad? It's OK. Motherfucker! Are you 0k? Yes we're okay. Where's Jenny? He took her. Where to? He dragged here in there. The bastard. What is this shit? That's what I'm thinking. Something's wrong with him. Yeah he was kinda strange lately. Why does he do that? There's only one way to find out. What are you doing? I'm going in there. Wait. I don't think it's a good idea. Jenny's in there and needs our help. I need to get in there. No please don't leave us alone. I won't leave Jenny alone. Let's get some help. Man, how long will it take for help to get here. We don't have enough time. Hey. I won't be long 0k? We'll come along. What? No way. And why not? Because it's too dangerous. You're not going in there alone. I'll be fine and the both of you stay here. And what if we don't? And if you need help? What are we going to do? Wait? I'm not going in there. Now pull yourself together. Do you want to stay here and do nothing? Who knows what's with Mike or what he's doing to Jenny. Listen, Jenny needs us. Hey we're all in the same boat and I'm telling you we're all going in together. Whether you want or not. Okay. All right, but stay behind me and no beep, okay? Don't worry about that. Here take this. What are you looking for? Mike always carries a gun when he's camping. Hope he was smart enough this time. Since when do you need a gun for camping? Jenny and me are afraid of wild pigs. Thank you Tina. All right. Voilà. Let's go! Did you hear that? It could be Jenny. Yes. Jenny? Oh Mike. Mike. Hey. All is OK. Is that her blood? I don't know. Is she hurt? I don't think so. No... Oh Mike... No. Hey. Hey, all is OK... all is well. All is well. We will help you. We need to move on. Wait... we're going soon, 0k? Okay. Come here. It's OK. Come here. I know. We're here. What's your name? Lucy! My child... My child... I thought I had lost you. Are you 0k? Let us never fight again. Please! I know you. You were watching us yesterday. I'm her father. She ran away from home a couple of weeks ago. I didn't allow her to go to the festival. I'm so sorry. I followed you because I thought you were going there. What else could I've done? That's Jenny... You wait here. David, wait. I'll be back in a minute. Oh Mike. Baby. I'm sorry. Oh Mikey Baby. No! Jenny. Oh David. He killed Mike. I know. I know. Be quiet. I'll get you out of here. Be quiet. Are you OK? Are you OK? Is all okay? We need to get out of here, come on. We've got to get out of here. Wait. Emily, let it go. What's wrong? What the hell are you doing here! Oh my God. David you scared us to death. I told you to wait. Jenny! We've got to keep moving... Come on guys. He killed Mike. Who? Jenny! No... no! Emily. No. No! No! I'm so sorry. No. I'll be back in a minute. The Curse of the Doctor... it was never broken. We've got to keep moving. Emily, let it go. Get up, get up. You can do it! Please, please, please! No! No! No.
