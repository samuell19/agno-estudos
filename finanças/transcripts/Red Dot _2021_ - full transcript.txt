Cheers! Cheers! Hi. I'm so proud of you. I can't believe it's over. Thank you for waiting. Driving back and forth to this dump. Well, now it's your turn to wait for me. Are you okay? - With what? - Moving to Stockholm with me. Yes, of course. Of course. It will be great. - I need to go to the bathroom. - Okay. MEN "Skrubbsår" by Magnus Rehn requested by Erik for Tove. They celebrate three years together. This is music and romance on Mix Megapol. We now have another lovebird with a special greeting. Hello, my name's David. Hi. Who do you want to send some love to? My girlfriend Nadja. Um, sorry, I'm a bit nervous. No worries, but hurry up. We don't have much time left. Oh, shit. Okay. Um… Nadja, you are the best thing and… - What song would you like? - Just a second, um… Everything is about to begin for you and me, and… …shit, this is stressful. "If you were an ocean… I would be a wave." "If you were the sky, I would have wings." Lovely. Here is "Om" by Niklas Strömstedt. No, wait. Nadja, will you, um… …will you marry me? Damn. Damn it. You're crazy. Proposing to me in the filthiest toilet in Sweden. Are you… are you sad-sad or happy-sad? Of course, I'll marry you! Yes. Excuse me. That was beautiful. Thanks. - Great news about the job, David. - Thanks. - It's you and me now. - Whatever happens. It all begins here. 1.5 YEARS LATER For fuck's sake! Fucking hell! - Ooh. - Hello! Can you give me a hand? I have to study! I want to be a doctor, not a fucking housewife. - Why are you so mad? - I'm fed up with nagging. You said you'd fix it, but the lid's still broken. I know. I haven't had the time. But you have time to play "Battlefreed." It's called "Battlefield." Whatever. I'll do it. Just like I do everything else. Come on. I work all the time. I need to chill. Move out, then. It wouldn't make any difference. - I'll fix it now. - No, it's too late. - What do you want me to do? - Maybe you should consider other people. What do you mean? I work nonstop. Everything I do is for us. It was for us that I... Yeah, that went well. Yeah, go on. Run away. You're damn good at that. A fucking champion! Oh. - Tomas… - Oh, sorry. No, I'm sorry. I've probably taken your slot. - I'll stop it. - No, I can come back later. - It's fine. - No. Hang on. Are you okay? Sorry. I'm… It's not a stomach bug. Poor thing. What's going on? I'm pregnant. Oh… - You're having a child? - Don't say anything. I haven't told David. I'm not sure if we… …should become parents. Everything's become so… What? I don't know. It feels like I have to do everything. David works all the time, and I have to do everything, and… if we have a baby, I'll end up on my own with it. I don't want to be a fucking housewife. Housewife? You? Yes. I remember what it was like. Uh… "How can I have a child when I'm not much more than a child myself?" Having a child is the greatest thing in life. At the same time, you worry about losing it. - Sorry, I didn't mean to… - Don't worry. I asked you. Right. I'm sure you and David will be amazing parents. You're a responsible person. I'm sure you will do what feels right for you. - Tomas. Thanks. - Hmm. Oh. - You're always so kind. - That's what neighbors are for. Okay. I'll come back later. Come on, Boris. MEET ME IN THE BATHROOM MEET ME ON THE STAIRS MEET ME BY THE CAR You think Mom will be happy? Stay, Boris, stay. Sorry. What's this? I thought we could get away for a while… and spend some time together. Bear Valley? Yes. Hiking in the mountains and camping under the northern lights. - Will you have time? - I called in sick. Has David Daftander called in sick? I may have the world's best job, but I don't want to lose the world's best girl. - That was rather soppy. - Maybe it was a bit over the top. Soppy? This is Don Juan Daftander. Okay? I'm just carsick. - My God. - Sorry. - What are you doing? - Easy, boy. - Shall I drive? - No, I'll drive. Come. Hello. - Can I say hello? - Sure. Hello. Yes. Huh? Can you smell game, huh? I have a dog too. A German Shepherd. Damn fine creatures. No. Boris, calm down. Who's a pretty boy, then? Yes, you are. Yes! You're a pretty boy. Yeah, right. Good. Your girl's pretty too. - Yes, she is. Thanks. - Just kidding. - There. Come. - Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Boris. What…? Boris, what are you doing? No, not here. No. Boris, come on. No. Down. Come here. - Fucking hell. - What? There's a bloody reindeer head on the flatbed. - Fuck. - Yeah. Reindeer for dinner tonight. - Damn. - For fuck's sake. - David. - It's cool. They won't notice it. I'm just going to… - Should I tell them? - They won't notice it. DOG ONBOARD What the hell? Here. There. Come on, boy. Hi. We have a reservation. Daftander. Hello. What's going on? Hi, there. Sorry about Mona. She doesn't like strangers. She's not a racist, but… Welcome. What can I do for you? We have a reservation. David Daftander. Here you are. Well, let's see then. Three nights. - But not tomorrow? - No, we'll camp out and hike. - See the northern lights. - Yes, exactly. Well, there's no guarantee you'll see them. We get Chinese people coming from the other side of the planet with cameras, and they leave without seeing them. But you might be lucky. It's fucking beautiful. But put your phones away. The northern lights are not for cameras. They are for making love. And that's a nice way to keep warm. I'll remember that. Yeah, but it's not a joke. You have to stick together. The nighttime cold is no joke. But I'm scaring the shit out of you. Don't be scared. It's quiet out there. - Right, the keys. - Yes. Thanks. Daftander. Mona. Northerners. They are… what do you call it when people are quiet? Right, here are your keys. Room 369. Through the main door, to the left and up the road. And here's a map. This is the hiking trail. If you get fed up with the cold and hiking, I invite hikers into my cottage. I can offer cold beer and a sauna. - Cool. - Thanks. I wish you a good night. - Thanks. - You too. Okay, run. What the fuck? DARKIE IN CAR Hey, they… What's wrong? What the fuck's wrong with people? If you'd talked to them, it wouldn't have happened. - Honey, it was just a tiny scratch. - Sure. - Stop! - What? Stop the car! - Is it theirs? - Fucking racists. - Where's the screwdriver? - Leave it. Please. They might come back. What…? Why are you here? - Uh… - What? Why are you scratching the car? Go to hell, fucking racist! Run! Run! - Run! - Drive! - Drive! - Yes! What the fuck? That felt damn good. But was it a good idea, huh? A scratch for a scratch. It's only fair. Sit, Boris. - Easy, boy. - Sit. Come. Damn it. Mind your head. There we are. Right. Check this out. - Welcome, my neighbors. - Fuck you! Yes, fuck you too! - Boris! - Wait for me! - Slow down, Boris. Slow down. - David! Honey! - Let's stop here. - Here? - Yes, I'm exhausted. - Okay. Come on! Do you have the instructions? Inside my brain. David, seriously. Surely you brought…? - These four… - Here's the fifth. - Where does this go? - Up your ass. Yeah, but when I ask… I need to find where this… where this… It seems logical that it should… - In there. And then fold it. - You drive me mad. - What was that? - You dork. What the hell…? There's a musical wolf here in the mountains. Ha, ha. Very funny. - Hi. - No. You fatty. - David. - No, can I... I just want to say that I… I'm pregnant. What? Shit. What... are you sure? I've done five tests. W-what…? Great. So, we... we're having a baby. You really think so? I know I've done… - David. - What? Right. Easy. Hello. Shh, Boris. Hello. Easy, Boris. No, but... quiet, Boris. Shh! Easy. What are you doing? Going outside? - It's probably some damn kid. - Kid? Here? I'll go and check. Hello! What the fuck? Where's it coming from? Hello! - Some damn kids. - Up here? Honey, it's on you. Move. Hello! Stop it! Fuck. Hello! - Stop it! - It's not funny! Hello! Who's there? Stop it! Easy, boy. Stop it! - David... - Hello. Stop it! - Shit! - Are you okay? - Yes. - Sorry. Stop it! Fucking Laser Man? Very funny. Let's get our stuff and move. - It's the middle of the night. - Never mind. Easy, boy. - Easy, boy. - Okay. - Shh. Easy, boy. - It's okay, sweetie. - David. - Huh? - Hello. - David. No, Boris! Boris! Boris! Seriously? Boris! Boris! Do you think…? - We've got to get out of here. - Run! David! What the fuck? What is this? What's going on? Come on! Run! Down! What's wrong? Ouch. It's nothing. I don't know. Damn. Come on! Come on! Come on! Down here. - Are you okay? - Yes. - This is sick! - There are two of them. - What the fuck's going on? - I don't know. It must be those inbred brothers. It's Boris! It's Boris! Wait, wait, wait. What are they doing? It's so sick. What's going on? They're getting closer. We've got to move. Come on. - I've got to go back to the tent. - We need to get out of here. Let's get our stuff and call the police. Let's head to the car. - We won't find it from here. - Damn! We don't know where we are. Even if we get to the car, the keys are in the tent. We can hot-wire it. I can't do that. Can you? No. Wait here. It's empty. Phones, everything, all gone. Don't go inside. This is totally sick. This is totally sick. I'll fucking kill them. - I'll fucking kill you! - Shh! Fuck! Fucking cunts! Quiet! They can hear you. We shouldn't have left him. What have we done? We haven't done anything. We haven't done anything. Not anything. Okay? I'll look for the keys. Oh, shit! Shit! Help! Nadja! - What should I do? - Get it off me! - How? - Just force it open. Just force it open. - Fuck. - Come on! Okay. Please fix this. Help me! Help! - Put pressure on it! - Okay, okay, okay. - Press hard. - Okay. Don't look. You need to go to the hospital. But you're a doctor. You can… In four years' time. - There. - We just scratched their car. Okay, okay. - Are they still out there? - I don't know. - We need to follow our tracks back. - Okay. Okay. Where the hell are we? Someone's there. We must get to the trees. Fuck you! One shot. What? - One shot. Then they reload. - What are you saying? The weapon. I think I saw it in their car. It's like in Battlefield. One shot, then you reload. It takes ten seconds. Is it like that in real life? I don't know. I don't know. Next time they shoot, we run. Okay? Okay. Okay. - Come on! - Go! David! David! David! David! Nadja! Nadja! David! Nadja! Watch out for the ice! Nadja! David! David! Nadja, where are you? Nadja! Watch out for the ice! Nadja! David! David! Help! David! Help me! Help me! Help! I'll grab you! Help me! Help me! Are you hit? Are you hit? - Take off your clothes. - All right. Get them off. How does it look? Mountain Rescue. How can I help? Help! Help will come once the storm subsides. Try to stay still, okay? How does it look? It'll be fine. - Do you know what you're doing? - I failed the sewing classes. But I have "sew-philis." - Ouch! - Bad joke. Okay. Okay. How are you? Can I…? Hang on. Oh, my God. It's beating fast. Is it supposed to? I think so. Like a hamster. Are we having a little hamster? Harald the hamster? - They're here. - What? They're here. Hello! It's the racist brother. He's a mountain rescuer. This can't be fucking happening. Hurry! Yeah. Go! Damn. Come on. Come on. Hey! Come on. Hello! I can't go on. Come on! David! Are you okay? Hey. Take it easy. Breathe. Look at me. Look at me. Breathe. Breathe. Okay. - Breathe. - Breathe. What's happening? - He's in my head all the time. - Breathe. - Breathe. - You were right. We should have called. Where the hell are we? Look. We came down here. This must be the emergency shelter. It can't be far to that bartender's house. - Can you make it? - Yes. See that? I can't get him out of my mind. I see him all the time. - Okay. - Why didn't I listen to you? I don't deserve to be a dad. Don't say that. Stop it. The cottage is over there. It's not far to go. Come on. Don't you get it? It's a sign. We don't deserve this. We can't become parents. - I don't deserve this. - Don't say that. - We don't deserve it. - Stop it. David, listen to me. It's not far to go. Come on. When we get home, we'll tell the police. It's not too late. Okay? Come on. Get up. Come on. Come on! I can't do it. I can't go on. I can't walk. Okay. I'll see if anyone's in and ask for help. Hi! What's happened? What are you doing? I had to do it. He was going to shoot you. Right? He was going to shoot you, right? Come. David! Hello. Oh, fuck. Up! Don't fall asleep. - Hey! Call an ambulance. - What's happened? Call for help. I'll... I'll call. You'll be fine. Don't fall asleep. Look at me. It'll be fine. Yes, it's me. They're here now. Thanks. Yeah. Hurry up! That's fine. What are you doing? Wait… What? They'll be here soon. Sit down and wait. Help will arrive soon. What's wrong? - We must go. Come. - Wait. Wait! It'll be over soon. I promise. It'll be over soon. Nothing will happen to you. - Get in! - It'll soon be over. What the hell did we do? Just take it easy. I don't wish you any harm. One has to help one's family. We just scratched a car! I don't know what you're on about. Stop it! I can't take anymore. Nadja. Nadja! What…? His eyes were so full of life. Tomas. I can't stop thinking of what he would look like now. Have you ever thought of that? He's lying there in his little coffin in the ground. Where is he now? So, what did you do, Nadja? I would like you to tell me. Tomas, we... Tell me. Of course, I'll marry you. - It's you and me now. - Whatever happens. It all begins here. I can't believe you proposed to me in that dirty toilet. I meant to do it in the café, but you came down. - So, it was your fault. - I can be dirty too. - Wait. I'll stop. - Drive. It's sexy. What's with the chastity belt? I know, it's hard. Or it's not… What the fuck was that? - Oh, my God! - No. Wait, Nadja. No! What the hell? No! It was a little boy. He… He's… dead. Everything was supposed to begin now. What are you doing? What are you doing? Well, I think… let's just drive for a bit and think this through. - We can't… - We must call the police. Let's just drive. We need to think about it. We can call later. It's okay. It's okay. I can't deal with this. I'll call the police. I'll tell them it was us. - No. Don't do anything rash. - Yes. Hang on. We don't even know if he... David, he was fucking dead. - I saw his face. I can't live with this. - Listen. Listen. It was me. I was driving. I'll end up in prison if you call them. No… I'm also guilty. Hang on. We... No. Listen to me. Listen! It was me. Only me. You didn't do anything. Police. Anyone there? - Hang on… - Hello. - Let me do it myself. - Hello. I just need some time. I will. I promise. It's quite incredible how you just move on. Continue. As if nothing's happened. I've tried to understand what kind of fucking people you are. Check it out! Tomas. Tomas. POLICE Did you see anything? Do you know anything that could be of help? Anything at all? Don't say that. Get a grip. - Need help? - No. - Are you sure? - They're heavy. I'm moving in up there. - That's right opposite us. - I see. - Those two windows. - Great. - We can wave to each other. - Yes. - Hi. - Hello. I couldn't help myself. Bicycle is not spelled with an "s." Thanks. - You're so kind. - What else are neighbors for? I wanted to give you this. You were so kind when I moved in. - Bear Valley? - Hmm. But this is… don't you want it yourself? No, you take it. You deserve to suffer like me. Sit down. - Please… - Sit down! Tomas, please. I'm so sorry. I'm so terribly sorry. I'll go to the police and tell them everything. - Bye, David. - Tomas, please. This isn't you. I would have wanted to kill us too. We shouldn't have left. We should have gone back. What we did was… it is unforgivable, but… …we're having a baby. Do you remember what you said? That… that suddenly you have everything… everything to lose. Good morning. Einar. She's awake now. Did you get hold of her? She wouldn't want to miss this. Einar. I'm calling, but there's no answer. There's a problem with my sister's phone. For fuck's sake. Tomas. - Come on. That's enough. - Stop it. This is my moment. I was going to shoot you. But then the storm came. That was lucky. You're right, Nadja. Killing you wouldn't help anyone. But why should you get off lightly? Huh? Now when you're carrying something more valuable than your pitiful lives? Tomas… please. You will regret this. I don't care about myself. I can go to jail. My life is over. Please, Tomas. - I understand. I've lived with the guilt. - You don't understand shit. But you will. Let's begin. Come on, David. You can do this. Maybe the mother survives. W-what do you want me to do? Drill. Please… Do it. Why? I want to share. I want you to feel what I feel. No, no. If you don't do it, I'll shoot Nadja. Then you both will die. It's your choice. Yes. Five seconds. What the hell are you doing? Five. Four. Three. Two. One. I can't do it! Okay. Well, then… It may not be as poetic, but… Bye, Nadja. Here you are. Do you realize what you've done? - Call for help. - Who the hell are you? - Who the hell are you? - Call the police. - Jarmo… - Who's he? - Why are you here? - They're psychopaths! - What the hell's going on? - Hang on. - Call for help! - Take it easy. - Help us! - What are you doing? Put those down! - It's no fucking toy. - What's she on about? Help! David! Run! Run! Run! Damn! I can't get up! Ugh! I can't go on. Come on, David. Wait. I can't. Up! Get up! Sorry. Sorry. It's all my fault. It can't end like this. Get up. Get up! Please. You must get out of here. Get out of here. Run! I can't. You must. Do it now. Run. I love you. I love you. Run. Run. Run. Where is she? It wasn't her fault. Where is she? I can't keep fleeing. This stops now. Do you hear? This stops now. Why are you smiling? You should have turned around long ago. No. No. No. No. Kill me. Please, kill me. Kill me. Shoot! Honey, it's okay now. You'll survive. I want you to kill me. Now you feel. I want to die! I know. No. Please. I understand. I understand now. Kill me! No… Nadja…
