Your stage time is 10 min. Okay. Hi. We're Antarctic 55. Good to see you out there. - What a crowd. - So great to see you all. - We've been a duo since school. - Yes, since high school. You know, when I go out people recognize me now. The other day, everybody looked at me. That's really great. - So I took my suit off. - Your suit's pretty bright. Everybody stared. Men and women. Both men and women? - Even a lion. - A lion? In the street? But I took my suit off. You're a celebrity now. - So I pulled my pants back up. - No wonder. Masaru. Hi. Still at it? No, I quit. I see. And you? I ain't doing nothing. Are you going somewhere? Yeah, job hunting. Hop on. No thanks. We used to ride to school together. Pedal right. Watch it. Will you watch out? Are you trying to kill me? Masaru, we should be in school? What the hell are you saying? We are in school. This is the school playground. Watanabe. Stop looking out the window. Must be those morons again. What the...? Hey you! Stop this! It got snatched. Go to class for a change? School is almost out. So what do you want to do? - A person doing gags. - That's a comedian. A comedian? Wanted to be a model when I was a kid. We all had big dreams. A fashion model? A plastic model. You're nuts. He's here again. Must have the hots for Sachiko. He's not her type. I'm leaving. Come again. Leaving already? I got a part-time job. That's great. Good luck. Yes, ma'am. If you're broke, get a job, too. What is this? What? Maybe it's a gift for you. Yak. Ewe me a break. It's cute. Hand over your money. What about you? I don't have any. Okay. Jump. Jump up and down. No money my ass. Take off your socks. I said lake off your sacks. Let's go. MIYAWAKI Welcome. Why don't you smoke, too? No thanks. They'll damage my health. So what? Your brains are already damaged. Thanks a lot. Ah, coffee please. Sure. You forgot this. It's a gift for you. No thanks. I don't want it. I want you to keep it. I have the same one. If you have time, would you read this? Right, right. Coffee. What's that? A love letter? You never know. How much? That'll be 800 yen. Leaving already? We're hard-working students. When I get into bed and close my eyes your face, Sachiko, appears before me. And you smile at me. It is evident. I have wholeheartedly fallen in love ...fallen in love with you. Fallen in love? Do you catch this? This is so embarrassing. Now listen well. Suppose you throw a dart at the circle on the left. What is the probability of the dart hitting A. This is based on the assumption that you do not miss the target. Get this right. The length of the radius is 70. All right? We've never asked you two to study. All we ask is not to give trouble to others. If you can't stop that you don't need to be in class. Maybe we should give them the axe. You mean for those two? But I earn that from my part-time job. I can't spare any money. In that case, try shop-lifting. Then I'll be arrested. My mom... I'm all she's got. You're all she's got? So what? Hurry up and get some. You go buy them. Why me? Want holes in your head? Okay. What do you want? What? A hamburger. Me, too. And you? I want... What do you want? Ah... I'll have a fishburger. A hamburger for me, too. Me, too. What's with you guys? Just go and buy them. It would be terrible, if they get any worse. Don't have the guts to be evil masterminds. Fiddling around with that thing. At best, they'll be petty crooks. Out of the way. Please. Stand back, boys. I'm going to park. Stand back. Good morning, sir. My, my. You boys are still here? Other schools would've expelled you long ago. You're morons. We're not a charity organization. It's brand new. I just had it waxed. Morons mustn't touch it. Step back. Be careful. I'm not hiding any here. Just take it off. The other? If you're broke, get a job. Welcome. What'll it be? Ready? Ah... two soup noodles, grilled dumplings and a beer. Have cigarettes? Shouldn't smoke and drink from your high school days. Give me a break, pop. Kids shouldn't be drinking beer, you little shits. There ain't no laws against kids drinking. There is such a law. It's my money. Stay out of it. You little... Cut it out. Sorry about it. Pop. Yes, sir. It's on me. Light his cigarette, you dick-head. Sorry, sir. I'll go and bring the car around. Excuse me, sir. I hear Kansai's trying to muscle in. I don't think it'll be a problem. Kazuo. Yes, sir. For the cigarettes. Keep it. Thank you, sir. Are you good to your parents? Yes, sir. Are you sure? Yes, I am, sir. Excuse me, sir. He must be a yakuza boss. Being a boss is somethingelse. He's cool. Sure is. I wanted to be a baseball player. That's not easy. Everyone told me I couldn't be a professional. Didn't you practice everyday? Yeah, ping-pong- Ping- pang ? No wonder. You must be the ones who set fire on Mr. Ashida's car. Why do you do such stupid things? We didn't do it. Any proof? You were the only ones there. Don't you get it. We didn't do it. It may sound cruel, but we should ask them to quit school. We don't want them to become gangsters but coming up with this they might be better off as comedians. They're not talented enough. Hello, everybody. The subject today is dreams. - What's yours? - A comedian. That's old fashioned. What about you? Me? I... Once more. Once more. Hello, everybody. The subject today is dreams. What's yours? A comedian. - That's old fashioned. - What about you? [)0 gags. That's a comedian. Wanted to be a model when I was a kid. A fashion model? A plastic model. You're nuts. My dream changed in junior high. I wanted to be a baseball player. Not an uncommon dream. Everyone told me I couldn't be a professional. I didn't understand why. You practiced everyday, didn't you? Yeah, ping-pong- Laugh, you bastards. You just don't have it. Go to Osaka and study. Yes, sir. This is a theater for adult films. - You're high school boys. - No, we ain't. You're wearing the uniform. Let's go. Mr. Takagi. Yes, sir. Why don't we see a movie? Good idea, Section Chief. Two adults. You boys were just here. Minors can't come in. We're wearing suits. They're school uniforms. My senior wants me to get advanced tickets. We don't have advanced tickets. What nonsense is this? If I return empty handed, my senior'll be mad at me. How many tickets do you need? Two. Take the complimentary tickets. Thank you very much. Well, Mr. Takagi, shall we go? Yes, sir. How can this look like a suit? I thought it would. Your fabulous idea. I even drew a moustache. It was dumb. Excuse me. Isn't Sachiko here today? She suddenly went out at this busy hour. What do you want? Want to be ripped off again? Them? Yes. You bastard. Let's go. Come on. Get it out. Must have something. Jump. You must have something. Hurry up. What are these? Precious movie tickets. Who wants your damn movie tickets? What's this? It's a doll. It's very precious to me. Precious, huh? Who cares about this fucking doll. Here you are. Thank you. Ah... Sachiko. Would you like to go to the movies with me? Forget what I said. I'm sorry. Recently, people get mugged by delinquents in back alleys. Lots of delinquents around recently. Don't you have any experience like that? I took part several times. You mugged people? No, got mugged. Got mugged? Should've fought back. Not very cool, is it? It isn't. I know how to cope with it. It's not cool, but it's the only way. Consider it your fate. Shinji. Masaru. He must be a boxer. I'll get even with him. Go ahead. Chairman. He wants to join, too. Wait for me upstairs. Young man if you want to join the gym, fill out this form. This is what he filled out. What a jerk. I hope you're off cigarettes and booze. Sure I am. Open your mouth. Begin. Don't just stand there. What do I do? Would you please show him... like how to hit a jab. Sure. Come here. First time? In position. Hit your jabs. Quicker. More. More. Put your strength in at impact. Try hitting this. Real hard. With practice, you'll get the hang of it. Work on it. Learning the basics won't do you any good. That's for amateurs. Do it your way. Try it. That's it. Is the movie still on? Yes, it is. Chairman, it's still on. Watching it should make us feel young again. Good idea, Chairman. I'd like 3 tickets. 2 executive class and 1 regular. 3,600 yen. Isn't student 1,000 yen? You're an executive. Yes, and also a student. - Isn't that right, gentlemen? - All right. 3,000 yen. Well, shall we go in. My wife won't get any sleep tonight. Kids nowadays are hopeless. There's a time limit. Skip the difficult ones. Do the easy ones first. And only after that cope with the difficult ones. You'll be tense and may not be able to finish all the questions. Morons. What are they up to now? I don't see any famous names. Want to go back? Let's go backstage. Fuck you. The referee won't see it. Step in further. Slowly. Concentrate. One, two. And Off. That's it. One, two. One... and off after two. Hit harder. Harder. You clowns began boxing, too. So you were lurking here. You dirty bastard. Wanna pick a fight? Break it up. I said break I! up. Can't you hear? Break it up. Go back to practice. Go on. Welcome. Thanks for the other night. Well, well. So we meet again. Pop. Give them some beer. No, thank you. We've begun boxing. I'm off cigarettes and booze. I see. That's swell. Anything goes as long as you don't become a gangster. You'll end up like him. Why don't you sit down? Kazuo. Yes, sir. Come here. Get me some cigarettes. Marlboros, sir? You're a quick learner. Keep the change. Also stop by my office and tell my boys to come and eat. Yes, sir. Begun boxing, huh? They might easily beat you up. Don't tease me. You can smoke mine, sir. No thanks. Going to college? No. I'm going to work. I see. I thought of my ring name. What is it? How dues Dynamite Kid sound'? It's cool. Isn't it? There goes the gong. Dynamite punch! The destructive dynamite punch. One, two. The Dynamite Kid is amazing! He's absolutely amazing! One dynamite punch after another. And another... Here it comes. The amazing dynamite blow! He's really fast. How are you doing? At my best, sir. Doing your road work? Yes, sir, everyday. Chairman. Let me spar with someone. You're not ready for it yet. Come on. Let me try. I practiced enough. You won't have a partner at your level. I'll take him on. Sure. You'll be asking for it. The smart-ass has to learn. Teach him what it's about. Yes, sir. Sure, teach me. Give him a feel of it. Your head-gear? I don't need it. You won't last a minute. I'll play with you. Play will; me? Try it. Hey, stop them. Hurry. Stop them. Stop it. Hey. Stop it. Let me try again. With you? Who would want to? He'll do it. Shinji, let's do it. You clowns can do as you like. Come on, Shinji. Let's do it. Let's spar. Let's do it. Do it seriously. I'll do the same. Okay? Get ready. Here goes the gong. The blue's better than the red smart-ass. You think so? His counter punches are good. Told you. Go ahead and eat this. What about you? I'm not very hungry. Pop, cigarettes. And a bottle of beer. Didn't you quit smoking and drinking? Back to my old habits. Your beer. '(nu can be me Dynamite Kid. I'll find something else. Left, left, one-two combo, left hook, then straight right. Got it? You forgot your right. I said straight. Try again. I said straight! You're free to quit anytime. Just because your friend quit doesn't mean you have to quit, too. Boxing's not a team sport. Practice today and think it over. Go on. Go practice. I think he's got what it takes. Hits punches he hasn't been taught. Let me look at him later. Your hooks yesterday were good. Hit that once more. Higher this time. Let me show you a trick. H' s me elbow blow. It's really effective. Of course, it's illegit. Try it. This is Takagi. Is Masaru there? I see. When he returns tell him Shinji called. This is how the equation would be. Then what is the size of S? Come on. Solve it. Takagi, has Miyawaki quit school? He was as good as suspended anyway. You can go ahead and quit, too. Must be lonely without your buddy. You can't bully around anymore. Step in. Step in. Shinji, knock him out. Damn it, Shinji. I told you to knock him down. Wait a minute. Take care of him. Wasn't that the elbow blow? Who taught you that? You sure got punched all over. Are you kidding? He wasn't punched. They were elbow blows. Elbow blows ? Guard yourself well. He comes in, step on his foot. No. Wait. Stop. If you step on his foot you can punch him all you want. If he falls, it'll look like a down. Do it again. Use it only in the match. Don't use it during practice. I'm sorry. Did your buddy quit? Yes. You must miss him? Yes. If you want to be a boxer you must be prepared to even betray your friends. Drink. I can't drink. Drink. Shouldn't you lay off booze and cigarettes? That's bullshit. Drink and eat, and throw up later. The tongue remembers the taste. Listen. Boxers and fashion models are alike. Keep weight down the same way. Drink. Ah... that feels good. Eafing? Better to eat and reduce weight later. Looks effective if you're fat. Get a job? Yes, salesman at a scale company. Sounds like something obscure. Of course not. It's a decent, legit job. I'm glad to hear that. Where is he going to work? At a scale company. That's not bad. Decent line of business. Ream? Welcome. Welcome. Are you ready to order? What will you have? Coffee will be fine. I'll have coffee. Four coffees. Yes, sir. Excuse me, sir. It's your job, asshole. Sorry, sir. Shall I... Never mind. You go buy the cigarettes. Haven't you got eyes? Move your ass and get going. Hey. Wait a minute. Excuse me. Do they sell Marlboros near here? There's a vending machine on the left. Thank you. Hi, Mr. Takagi. We've begun boxing, too. I see. Step aside. Kanayama. What's up? What ever happened to you? I got beaten up. Who did it? Some strange dude. Some strange dude? We had a bit of a run-in. Where the hell is he? He came with me. Why the fuck did he come with you? All right. I'll lick him. In the match before the main event I'm thinking of letting him debut. I thought of a great ring name. What's that? A-Bomb Bay! That sounds terrible. Why? You can be H-Bamb Bay. No thanks. Why not? That sounds corny. Shall we have some tea? How many from your class got into national universities? None this year. Better luck next year, right? What about your class? From my class, Iizuka got into Yokohama. He really studied hard. The rest got into private universities. Our principal wishes our school to become prestigious but it won't happen. A-BOMB WAS HERE! Go around him. Stop, stop it. I said stop it. Jab, jab. Don't back out nor look down. Go around. Fight back. All right, stop. That's enough. Thank you. You okav? That was good. Remember how you used your left. Get it into your head. Thank you very much. What the fuck is going on? Things are getting pretty sticky on our turf. The word's getting around. We're keeping close touch to find the bastards. You dick-heads, move your ass. Move your ass. Sorry, sir. Go out and find them. Kazuo. Yes, sir. Cigarettes. Yes, sir. Keep the change. Thank you, sir. Hey. How's your dad? He's fine, sir. And your mom? She's somehow hanging on, too. Excuse me, sir. Is that right? ...Sure. Where is it? I got it. Kazuo. Come with me. Where are they? Over there, sir. Them? What're you waiting for? Finish off the maggots. I said finish them aft. What's keeping you? Kazuo. Take this and go to the police. I've already talked to the families in Kyushu. Take a vacation for a while. Still the same weight? Hasn't lost any at all. What's with you? Ou...ouch. Outside. Put on the coat and run. He isn't losing his weight. I'm afraid he's drinking. The match is not far ahead. Shigeta, make sure you keep an eye on him. I'm sorry, sir. What do you two come here for anyway? Do you think people come here for fun? If you can't be serious, quit. Get out. Are you staying or quitting? Which is it? I'll stay. You'll stay? Then do it right. Yes, sir. Are you sure? Yes, sir. What about you? Which is it? Make up your mind. Takagi, can you teach us the jab? Sure. Pull quickly. Pull. Try it on me. One kilo more. Work on it. Yes, I will. Hayashi. Yes. Take it easy. Get on quietly. With your clothes on? Don't worry. I keep fit. Your weight is stable. I lead a stoic life. How is it, Eagle? I'm sure he'll do it. He trained hard. Didn't you? Yes. Good luck. He won't make it. Inviting a girl into the locker room? Not too tight? Go pass the check. Good luck. Shinji, shall we go now? Yes, sir. Get warmed up. Let's go easy on it. You guys go upstairs and watch. Good luck. We'll all be watching. Takagi What happened? I punched blindly and it hit him. That's good. Hayashi, let's go. I'll be going now. Your gloves? Put them on upstairs. Why don't we go inside, too. Eagle, do the usual. That's so cool. Good luck. What do you think you're doing flirting around like that? You idiot. You've lost your speed from excessive reduction. He's had enough. Throw in the towel. If he comes in, step on his foot. As in practice. All right? When things get bad, use your elbow... head... Use anything. Let's go. Return the gloves yourself. Getting too old for this. I can't move anymore. Well, shall we go now? You think you can win smoking all that? You asshole. Let's go watch Eagle. He'll lose. Let's split. Come on. Let's split. Shigeta, look over the practice tomorrow. Yes, sir. We'll be going now. I'm sorry we failed you. You did every single thing wrong. You let him step on your foot. Can't win, fooling around with a chick like that. Quit boxing. Shigeta, let's go. Getting flowers like these... I'm not asking you for 3 digits per month. Just sell your salary's worth. You guys are thieves. How can you live with yourselves? The company“ go bankrupt. I'll be fired before that, though. If you're not willing to try, hurry up and quit. There are plenty of jobs out there. Let's go eat. He called us thieves. I'm quitting. This is ridiculous. You should quit, too. Quit and be a cab driver or something. - We've been a duo since school. - Yes, since high school. - Our teachers at school were weird. - Yes, really weird. At other schools, teachers wore gym suits and had wooden swords. That's usual for gym teachers. Our teachers wore suits and had chalk. What's wrong with that? - Some were in white and carried beakers. - They were science teachers. - Some were even worse. - Worse? - I never saw them in school. - That's really bad. - They worked next door. - At another school? Excuse me. I'd like some water. Your husband is so naive. He didn't have to quit with him. He's so timid. I was looking forward to a grandchild... Lucky you didn't have one. You wouldn't be working now. That's true. You did as much as you could. It just didn't work out. Nothing is tougher than boxing. I wish you luck. Thank you very much. Goodbye, sir. You can have them. Thank you very much. Good luck. Taking these damn pills... Can he continue? Shinji, a visitor. Masaru. Hey, long time, no see. Training hard? Yes. When do you finish? A bit more. Let's go somewhere when you're done. Sure. That was some punch. 30 more. Faster. Sorry, I couldn't help it. It came out naturally. Won't happen again. Okay, no more. Welcome, sir. Mr. Miyawaki was called on urgent business. He wishes you to have some drinks upstairs. Hi. Come at me, you asshole. Masaru. Shinji. Sorry about yesterday. I've got time today. Fine. I won't bother no more. MV apologies. Let's go. Something came up. I've got to run. See you around. Keep it up. Masaru. Is it something Mr. Chairman said? No, nothing. One day you'll be a champ and I'll be a boss. Let's meet then. See you. Manager of the Sendai branch. That's a promotion, isn't it? Do you seriously mean that? How many men do you think I had under me? 22. I had 23. If I go to Sendai, I'll only have 5 men. Get it? But you'll be at the top. You don't really get it, do you? What they call the Sendai Branch isn't in Sendai City. It's 30 mins. by car in a place called Nigatake. A pre-fabricated office by a military base. You'd eventually be called back to the head office. You cabbies are better off. You're free to work or take breaks whenever you like. Isn't Mr. Yamamoto a cab driver now? Yamamoto? You know Yamamoto? Not so well. Yamamoto... He was in sales for 20 years. Suddenly transferred to a factory as a security guard. - That's like getting fired. - That's why he's a cab driver now. Welcome. Hey, can you guys move over? I said move aver. There are empty tables. I like it here. What's wrong with you? Sorry, sir. Shigeta. Where's Shinji? He finished practice and left with Hayashi. Come upstairs for a minute? I was the rookie of the year once. I was a good boxer. But... The usual training is worthless. Isn't Shinji hanging out with Hayashi recently? Shinji should know better. Better yell at him. Times are changing. Yelling will only scare the kids away. If he wins the next match we can let him go for the title. He could turn out to be better than Eagle. Some weights in your pants during weighing will fool your opponent. He'll think you had a tough reduction. Aren't you drinking? My match is coming up soon. Come on. You either have it or don't. Being so rigid won't help you. A weak boxer is weak, whether he drinks or not. The same applies to strong ones. Eat more. I've already had enough. Just go and throw up. Just throw up. Want it? Yes, with pleasure. Like hell I would. You're still new. You should work harder. We have enough cars. No need to come back on time. If you don't earn enough, ride longer. We can adjust the tachometer. Work harder, if you want your wife to be happy. Thank you. They all nag about the same things. Fell asleep in a park the other day. When I woke up it was evening. Never thought it was so tough. Went out with Hayashi, didn't you? Yes, but I didn't drink. If you go to such places you'll end up drinking even if you don't intend to. Shouldn't be hanging out with Hayashi. He'll only teach you bad things. If you want to be a professional boxer, better learn to control your own life. Did the Chairman say anything? No, nothing. Let's go drink after practice. I'll take a rain check today. Don't let the Chairman manipulate you. Trust your instincts. That's the best. Welcome. Mr. Hayashi, shall I move over? Never mind. What would you like? Two beers as a starter. Yes, sir. Two beers. Here you are. I don't see you at the factory recently. Well, I've been busy boxing. Is that so. Best of luck. The Chairman's old fashioned. No booze, no women... Too demanding. He's wrecked many boxers. Remember the last champion? He wrecked him, too. Hey, you are drinking. Yes, I decided to drink. Either way, strong ones are strong. Do you get in touch with him sometimes? You mean Mr. Terashima? Yes, sir. I contact him sometimes. I hope you're looking after Kazuo. I have my guys visit him occasionally. You bastards. I don't want your worthless fingers. I want the case dealt with properly. What were you dick-heads doing anyway? Sorry, sir. Chairman. You're not going to agree to a truce, are you? I'm getting in touch with them now. I'm dead against it. Even alone, I'll go kill them. Wait. I'm not yellow-livered like your lot. What the hell is he? I'll have him apologize later. Such words to the chairman. A finger or two won't do. Yes, sir. Never mind. Forget about it. His turf was to be yours anyway. He used money to grab it while you were in Kyushu. Sir, I'll take care of him. Let's go play golf tomorrow. What's your handicap now? I guess 12 or 13. Not much different from mine. Let's go. Can't lose weight hanging out with him. Are you serious about the match? Practice more and reduce weight. Why don't you quiz'. Please calm down, Chairman. You'll do it. Right, Shinji? Having trouble reducing? I can't lose any weight. If you take these, you can easily lose 2 or 3 kilos. But you'll be pissing all the time. Shinji, where are you going? Where were you? Men's room. You're really slow today. Is anything wrong with you? I'm all right. Then put your mind to it. Yes, sir. It's hopeless. You've become soft. You're not the main eventer. Take it easy. Are you all right? Mr. Terashima, where are we going? Keep quiet. You'll find out. You'll soon find out. Hey, that's enough. Hey, your turn. Hurry up and do it. I told you to do it. What were you doing during my absence? Come on. Do it, you bastard. Hurry up and do it. Forgive me. Forgive me. Step aside. I said step aside. You're not a kid. Stop crying, you bastard. I said move! Hang in there. Don't use your elbow so obviously. When it gets bad, hug him. Chairman, he's already had enough. Not yet. Chairman, he'll die. Do you want him dead? Took my pants off and police came. How did they find out? Someone called them. - Naked? You'll stand out. - I sure did. - I put my suit back on. - Too late for that. So, not to stand out... - I wore a bald wig. - That's even worse. Not to draw attention... What d'you do? - I wore a swan neck. - That's outrageous. But the police didn't catch me. If you get caught, you'll be in big trouble. But I ain't stupid. I don't repeat mistakes. You've been arrested once. That's stupid enough. You get caught now... Good fighting. Thank you very much. Tomahawk, you're terrific. Ream? You really became a strong fighter. ...go to the movie with me? No thank you. Nothing's changed. Dunn. Stop looking out the window. Do you think morons like us are still around? We are probably the last. Hey, you morons studying hard? Cut it out, Shinji. Must be some morons again. Masaru, do you think we're already finished? Hell no. We haven't even started.
