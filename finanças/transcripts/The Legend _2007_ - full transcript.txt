Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad That man, Yon Ho Gae, who turned the land of Khitan into hell... My intent was always to be allies with Khitan. His actions caused misunderstanding between us. He will pay for his crimes. So what is it that you want to say, King of Goguryeo? Who will first become our younger brother out of the four tribes here? Younger brother? Do you want to continue hearing what will happen if Goguryeo becomes your elder brother? Or will you kill me and face Goguryeo when Yon Ho Gae becomes king? Commander! The deserters are increasing. We cannot stop them! Deserters will be executed immediately! Lord Yon has taken the two sacred symbols. We should have killed him when we had the chance! He's dead. It says he killed himself. I know you worked hard to find and save me. That's why I feel bad about this favor. Tell the king you couldn't find Sujini. Bring me some water. Look here. Episode 22 His Majesty's encampment What is this I hear? His Majesty has fallen ill? I don't know. He collapsed suddenly. What is wrong with him? His pulse is very erratic. It is racing at breakneck speed. Why? If I knew that... There are more deserters approaching. They are being pursued by two men on horseback. General. Yes, Your Majesty! Please go and welcome them in my stead. All deserters will be given positions in my army. I will do as you command, Your Majesty! Half of his army have already deserted. It is clear there is rebellion in his camp. Teacher. Your Majesty. Talk to the deserters and find out what Ho Gae is doing. I will do so. The burumsae just delivered a message saying an internal war has begun among Ho Gae's men. Is that so? Let's go before any more of my men are harmed. Your Majesty, are you all right? Please wake up! The baby is going to die! Look here! Look here! You have to push! You have to push! Push! Harder! Harder! I raced here for a day and a night because I heard a strange rumor. There are rumors that the symbols of the Phoenix and Blue Dragon are with Lady Kiha. Lady Kiha is in labor. Perhaps you can discuss this with her later? How is that? It is not yet the time. That's why I think she's in danger. I hope you have taken good care of the thing I gave you. If it's a boy, you will proceed at once. The only thing that can be held in this box is the tiny heart of a newborn baby. You must not miss the timing. Lord Ho Gae's encampment They are increasing in numbers. There is not much else we can do. Commander, we must retreat before it is too late. Don't follow me anymore. Commander! How is Lady Kiha? I thought both mother and child would die because the mother was unconscious. But fortunately, the child came out by itself. Is she all right? She's just unconscious. She's not dead. The child... Is it a daughter? It's a boy. I think I know who the father is. But why is she on the battlefield in her state? I feel like crap! She's your sister. Kiha is your older sister. We took her from the Shi family in Baekje. She gained her memory a few days ago. She knows that you are her younger sister. And the father of that child is your king. You bastard...! Save the baby. The Hwachun are waiting outside. They will tear its chest open and take its heart. I cannot stop them. You have to save him. What is this crazy fool barking about? Take the child far away. Do not let anyone see him until his heart is bigger. The Hwachun are everywhere. Gooknae Castle will not be safe. He is the child of your king and your sister. My child! Where is my child? Where is my child? My dear Kiha... Are you well? Where are the sacred symbols? Were they not in her possession? Where is my child? Lady Kiha! The child... ...was killed. Sa Ryang has brought the child's heart to me. Lies... Shall I explain again why we had to do this? You're speaking lies! For two thousand years, the Hwachun have... Shut up! Lady Kiha! You must remember. As mother of the earth, you must not forget the Tiger tribe. If you want to kill me, come to Abullansa. If you want the world, come to Abullansa. That is the place where everything began. Live. Please live on... The child is... When the awakened four symbols find their place, it will use the blood of the True Descendant as a key to bring down the power of Heaven. That fool... He tricked me! The child... I must find the child! The child is still alive! Lord Ho Gae's encampment Your Majesty! Your Majesty! We have sinned against you, Your Majesty. I give my sword to you and await your judgment. Your Majesty! {\a6}The last soldiers of Ho Gae's army join His Majesty's army No sign of him? We have sent scouts in all directions. There are about twenty Iron Horse Warriors who are with Commander Ho Gae. And their direction is headed toward... Who's there! You! Overlord of Gwanmi! If you are looking for the Iron Horse Warriors, I saw them on the way here. Their pursuers were about forty to fifty men. Where's Sujini? - General Go! - Yes, Your Majesty. Take the troops and try and block the Khitans. Don't fight. Try and distract them instead. Your Majesty, are you going to save him? I told you before. Insurgents will be punished only by me. Come with me. You should take forces with you. You should never go anywhere alone. If we move our troops, the Khitans will notice. Then we will have war. - Teacher. - Yes. Obey me. Do not send soldiers after me. - Your Majesty, the Khitans are... - Just block them for me. Come on, let's go! We should hurry there so we can eat soon! I'm starving! Where is he going anyway? Wait, he's not going after Yon Ho Gae...? Abandoned village near Kidohari tribe, Khitan Commander, the enemy will be on us soon! Something's strange. I feel like we're being hunted. Who is Yon Ho Gae? How dare you speak his name! He is the grand commander of Great Goguryeo! He has already been given to us by the king. {\a6}Dutai of Kidohari tribe Grand commander, my foot! Is that so? Has the King of Goguryeo really given me over to you? You didn't believe that, so you spied on your own men. But you came out by yourself. I, Dutai of Kidohari, will take your head. It won't be that easy. Will you not heed your Khan's orders? The man before you is a man of Goguryeo. You cannot harm him without my permission. If the Khan knew that you were doing this, he would be furious! Men of Khitan! Here are the king and the grand commander of Goguryeo! If we kill them, victory belongs to Khitan! I speak to the men of Khitan! This is my final warning. I have come here to meet my fellow countrymen. I will not show mercy if you continue to obstruct me! To prevent a bigger war from happening, all of you must be killed to be silenced. Will you not move back? The one who kills the king will be the finest warrior of Khitan! Attack! Do you see them? The men who died because of us? Your Majesty, King of Goguryeo... This is what it is to be king. One must make critical decisions everyday even though one cannot see the future. And each and every time, there is regret. If you had come when I summoned you, it may have been over with fewer men dead. Stop speaking nonsense. If you came to kill me, then do so! So that I can kill you! Did you want to be king so badly? Don't you get it? I never wanted to be king. All I wanted was to take revenge against you. You bastard! You..! Ho Gae... Don't you know why I'm here? Don't you know why I came without soldiers? Don't you know why I had to kill all of these men?! You wanted to laugh at me. Yes, now that you've seen me, how is it? Or did you want me to bow before you and call you Your Majesty? Do it! Bow before me and call me Your Majesty! Give me a reason not to kill you. Reason...? You killed my mother and father. You killed the heart of the woman I loved. You want me to serve you as king? Don't hesitate. Take my life! Grand commander of Goguryeo, Yon Ho Gae... You have achieved great victory against Khitan during your expedition. However, as you have disobeyed the king's orders, you will have your title taken away and be exiled. Don't ever return to Goguryeo again. Turn around. It's not over yet. Halt! Commander, are you all right? Jumuchi... Your Majesty... Your Majesty... Sacred symbol of the White Tiger - How is he? - He is recovering quickly. - Your Majesty! - Just lie down! What has become of the commander? His men took him away. I did not ask where they were headed. I, Juk Hwan, have been disloyal to you. But may I dare to make a request? You have never been disloyal to me. I sent you out here, and I ordered you to serve the commander. You may speak. Please tell a lie, Your Majesty. The Khitans will pursue the commander. I am already severely injured and will not survive for long. Will you take my head and tell them it is the commander's? Please forgive me for asking you to lie. I bow before you, Your Majesty. Please give my head to Khitan. His Majesty's encampment - He's awake! - Are you all right? Are you awake? Dalbi... Are you all right? Does it hurt? Are you all right? It itches. Food? Food. Sacred symbol of the White Tiger For the Turtle Snake, dark wrath. For the Blue Dragon, cold purpose. The White Tiger represents innocent courage. So Jumuchi... What? The chosen guardian of the White Tiger is you, Jumuchi. What am I supposed to do? What do you think of this piece of metal, blacksmith Ba Son? This metal cannot be forged by humans. It can't be melted or pounded by humans. Did you hear that? This sacred symbol must be kept this way by the guardian. What's our king doing, by the way? He was feeling unwell before, wasn't he? Our king seems well enough physically... but I don't know about his heart. So you found her? Yes. But? She asked me to pretend I couldn't find her. So you left her there by herself? That's what she wanted. She wanted me to be beside you. If we go back to the place you found her... would we be able to find her? No. I won't be able to find her again. Lady Kiha... Lady Kiha! We found him. He was almost killed by the Khitans, but he escaped and is hiding at the Lao residence. He is said to be severely wounded. Should we bring him here? I will go to him. I will make preparations. We should... have a funeral for Sa Ryang. Everything has already been prepared. All you have to do is send him off. Tell them to dig a deeper grave. He must not be cold. I will do as you ordered. Live. Please live on... The child is... Abullansa is only a day's journey away. Everyone is waiting for us. The fire priestess and the one she serves. I can't do anything for you. I've become a useless fellow. I'm with the woman who gave poison to my father, but I can't even show my anger. I too have nothing left. I have lost everything that is precious to me. I finally understand everything now that I have lost all. Don't you get it? Heaven cares nothing for people like us. Heaven has its eyes only on one person. The only thing that is important to Heaven is how that one person passes the trials. You and I... We are merely pawns in Heaven's trials. You mean we were instruments in Heaven's games? We were merely pawns? I plan to fight against Heaven. I will make it so that Heaven can no longer interfere in the lives of men. If we do that, what will we gain? If Heaven departs from us, the world we live in may become hell. I don't trust men. I see myself and how I've changed. How despicable and cruel we can be. I don't care if it becomes hell. At the very least, I will make my own destiny. On the return journey, the king was joined by 10,000 refugees of Goguryeo... and countless nomadic horsemen. Instead of taking the direct route back to Gooknae Castle, he took the eastern route by passing the border of Later Yan. This was to show them his military strength and dissuade them from attacking in the future. {\a6}Goguryeo's Gooknae Castle Now that His Majesty has rounded up the armies of the four provinces, all the armies in Goguryeo now belong to the king. He gathered the five provinces under one rule, and made all laws uniform across all provinces. And he built upon the late King Sosurim's words to become a powerful ruler. Yon residence His Majesty grieved over the death of Yon Ga Ryuh for a long time. He said repeatedly that he had lost the only man who could look after Gooknae Castle. Abullansa Welcome, mother of the earth, fire priestess Kajin. We have waited a long time for you. An old tiger from the ancient Tiger tribe... dared to use the power of fire in the Phoenix Heart to regain his youth. The sacred symbols and Abullansa are now yours. I ask the elders, the descendants of the Tiger tribe. Who am I? You are the fire priestess, mother of the Tiger tribe. Then who is that thing in front of me who cannot die? He has been the grand elder from the time which we can no longer remember. What must I do to kill him? We do not know, Lady Kiha. Let me ask you. What must I do to kill you? Listen to me carefully. No matter what I do, it will be after I kill you. Only then will I begin. Your child is still alive. Will you confirm it yourself? Use my power for a moment. I will help you remember. Go back to that day. The day of the child's birth, who else was there with you? Save the baby. What is this crazy fool barking about? He is the child of your king and your sister. Those things I just saw... Did you see them too? That girl... Is she your sister? My sister... She recognized my baby. My sister and my baby... Are they in your hands? Tell me. What is it that you want? We want to reclaim the land of the Tiger tribe that was stolen by Joo Shin. And? There must be something you want for yourself! Dam Duk's heart. And the sacred symbols of the Turtle Snake and the White Tiger in his possession. If that happens, all four symbols will be together. And I will gain Heaven's power. That is what I want. The Hwachun are everywhere in the four corners of this world. Lady Kiha... Do you want to save the child's life? If you are able to get everything you want, then you will save my child? This is from the overlord of Soogok Fortress. He says Baekje has begun to move. The peasants are uneasy and have delayed harvesting their crops on the plains. So... You said the eastern troops were looking for a training ground. Yes, Your Majesty. Let them do it at Soogok Fortress. But make sure you take along sufficient supplies so as not to overburden them. I will deliver your orders. Next is a letter sent anonymously via the Guh Mool people. General Go! These are all the reports that I have to read and authorize. Do you want to split them with me? Your Majesty, I would rather attack Baekje by myself. All right then. Read that part again. - The crown prince of Later Yan... - Before that. We have heard that Your Majesty is a man who can make all pain disappear in one day. So a king should... have the ability to make all wounds disappear in a day. And I think that he should go out and fight for another day. He'll say, "Follow me! I'm your king!" Brought to you by WITH S2 Written In The Heavens Subbing Squad Translator: MrsKorea Timers: MrsKorea, jann Editor/QC: thunderbolt Coordinators: mily2, ay_link All we have to do is protect the crown prince? But I don't know what he looks like. Do you know him? Two years have already passed. I have nothing worth remembering. Please do NOT hardsub and/or stream this episode using our English subtitles.
