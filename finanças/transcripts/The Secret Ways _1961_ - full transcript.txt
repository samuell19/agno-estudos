Here you go, pal! My boy! Good to see you! - Herr Sheffler, how are you? - Good to see you! - But you look exceedingly well! - Thank you. - Oh, make yourself comfortable! - Thanks. What would you like? - Coffee or brandy perhaps? - Brandy is fine. A brandy for Mr. Reynolds, please, and myself. Well, I see you got the same old buzzer system. You are teasing! Same as before! Because I am old and foolish, left behind the times! But tell me, I didn't expect you until tomorrow. - How did you get here, by car? - Plane. Straight as an arrow to your door! - I smelled money. - And your luggage? The hotel wanted it for a souvenir. Charming! Were you working long in Madrid? Few months, off and on. Nothing steady. And before that, where were you? Around. That man still following you, is he? How would you know? A 'bookie' you call him, correct? That clown? No, he's the bookie's collector. Yes, they take these extreme measures when the debt is considerable. Correct? Now don't play around, Herman. You've had me looked up. You know what I'm in to them for precisely. Then quit dangling me. Get to the point. Sit down, please. The man in the center here is Jancsi. In every part of Hungary there are men searching for Jancsi. When they find him... Kaput? We wish him out of the country, before this can happen. - Who is we? - Private interest. I can tell you nothing except they are quite determined and will pay according to the risk. What is this Jancsi? A former head of the University, a leader in the revolution, a very popular figure. Not much is known of his activities recently. He's been in hiding, of course. Why is he so important to you? A man is in disfavor, for whatever reason, with one group. Another group wishes to save him. That's all I know. Herman, which group are you with? You are teasing. Silly boy! Anyway, thank you very much but I wouldn't be interested. Not interested in saving a man's life? Come off it, Herman! Neither are you! If I'm wrong, why don't you go get him? Oh, my boy! I have not your experience from the war, your skills, you knowledge... Okay and you don't need the money, so that lets you out! Assuming I'd do it, how could I find this Jancsi? Oh, fine! We have reason to believe his daughter, Julie, escaped into Austria very recently. She's presumed to be dead by the authorities. From drowning, I believe. - Not much use, is it? - But, it's something! And a refugee, young, pretty, newly arrived in Vienna... That shouldn't be too difficult for you. Easy. Of course, you couldn't use regular channels, - jeopardize her position. - Of course not. She'd have changed her name. Naturally. Am I boring you, Michael? Now look, Herman, it's too hokey! Suppose I do find the girl? Then what? I can't go poking around Budapest. I'm an American! They'll know every move I make! Yes, my boy... And don't tell me to grow a mustache! It's been done. That's what we want! The unlikeliness of an American! - Precisely! You see it? - No, I don't. Your name, Robert Stevens. Occupation, actor. Here is your passport, visa, visitor's permit and press card. The newspaper you work for, United States, Ohio. Here are the articles you have written. Your style is corny, forgive the liberty. And here is your ticket. The train leaves Vienna for Budapest on July 19th at 12 am. You will be met by a welcoming committee on your arrival in Budapest at 4 pm, approximate. Their trains never run on time as ours do. And you leave Budapest on July 21st, 9 pm. Yes. It has taken some time to arrange. I am rather proud. Now what do you say? Pretty sure of me, weren't you, Herman? You've miscalculated, old boy. Not for me! I'll see you around. Your hotel... You cannot return until you pay them two thousand dollars, correct? And the funny little man on the street wants forty thousand, correct? In short, you are a man without recourse, correct? There can't be that many new arrivals. - As I said, I can't help you. - Why? You're too busy? That's it, exactly. You're wasting my time... But you must be able to give me some information! I'm sorry, sir. Even if I had any information, I'm forbidden to give it out, except to relatives. - Well, maybe I am a relative! - You'd need proof. Good day! Danke. - Good evening. - Good evening. Have you got paprika chicken today? Oh, yes. Fine, and a little green salad too. - How? - Asalade. Oh, yes. How long have you been here? One year. I am learning to speak English. Wonderful. Sehr gut! You've been in Vienna one year? Nein. Excuse me, I go. You see, you frightened her. Most of the people in here will run away if you get too inquisitive. Except me. My name is Elsa. What's yours? Stevens. You don't mind if I sit with you? You seem to be sat. You're most polite. I heard you order paprika chicken. May I have some, too? My favorite. You can have mine, when it comes. I'm not really hungry. Are you here on business, Stevens? What is your business? You could say I'm in the people game. Then you are not connected with Wall Street? Sorry. I'd like to meet someone connected with Wall Street. I'm sure you will. You know, I have a feeling we're both wasting time. How long have you been in Vienna? Four years now. I was formerly acting with the People's State Theatre in Budapest. Is that a fact? That's terribly interesting. Danke. Thanks. I see you're gonna be all tied up. Before I go, I'd like to ask you a favor. - Tonight, I am busy. - Lucky Pierre. Have you ever seen her? From this I couldn't recognize my best friend, if I had one. I'm sure you had one. You're a doll. Bitte. - Thank you. Come again, please. - Thank you. Well, you've had a busy day! Did you want to see me, friend? Evening, mister. You want company? You need a guide? - Go away! - I know this city like a book! I want to help, I'm a friend. - Very sympathetic. - Beat it! So many like you come to the center. - I see what goes on. - What goes on? They are not sympathetic. No feeling. I'm a refugee myself. The picture you carry, may I see it? Is it someone Hungarian like myself? - You're Hungarian? - On my mother's side. If I don't recognize the one you seek, I'll go away. No questions, no name, please. Just the picture. Well now, there is a young lady who recently moved into our section. I couldn't say positively, it is this one. What address? Now I have to remember that, don't I, to help you? I love you, too. Oh. - You want coffee? - Yeah, sure. How do you feel now? Lousy. Would you like me to rub your back? No, I've got to get up. Don't be silly. You need to rest. Where's that address? Is it so important? To me, it's like Wall Street. Where is it? - Don't go. - I have to. I won't let you. - Now look, baby... - Tell me lies. Don't. You don't want too. Where is it? Yes? What is it? My name is Stevens. I'd like to talk to you. No, I can't see anyone. Wait a minute, Julia. My name is not Julia. You have come to the wrong person. Don't get excited. I'm not gonna hurt you. I just want to talk. Well... Now that you've asked me in, shall we sit? Okay, take your time. I feel unsociable myself. You got any decent coffee? I hate bad coffee and I just had the worst. - Get out! - Settle down? If anybody is gonna be sore, it ought to be me. Get out! Now, you sit there and relax! I've just about had it! All this runaround for a few questions. There must be an easier way. - Who are you? - I'm an international spy! I thought you might be at first, but you behave more like an American gangster. Thank you, Julia. My name is not Julia! I'm Greta Heinrich. Whatever it is you want, you have come to the wrong person! Look, I'm a newspaperman. I'm on my way to Budapest. I want an interview with your father. I was told you could help me. - Who told you? - What's the difference? Disappointing, isn't it? The truth is always so simple. - Simple? It's ridiculous! - Maybe. But, I'm gonna try! - Will you help me? - You can't be serious! - I am. - Impossible! - Why? - It's crazy! I have not the faintest idea what you are talking about. Okay. Forget it. I'll send you a copy of the interview when I come back. Any message for him? I told you, I'm Greta Heinrich. Then there's no message. No! So long, Julia. Wait! When do you go? Tomorrow. Noon train. I've changed my mind. I would be interested to talk to you. Really? Do you know the canal below the bridge? I'll meet you there. What's wrong with here? - It's not safe for you. - You're worried about me now. Unless we can talk there, we won't talk at all. That's all I can do. - What time? - Seven o'clock. Seven o'clock. Nice to have met you, Julia. Auf Wiedersehen. Don't trouble yourself to wait. She isn't coming. You understand? She will not come. Why? She has no wish to see you. I'll wait. Let me give you some advice, Mr. Stevens. I'm a man who abhors violence Yet you have ignored one serious warning and renewed your persistence. Unless you stop now, you leave me no alternative. But to kill me? Reluctantly. I abhor violence. Good night, Mr. Stevens. Who is your friend? Did he frighten you? That depends. I wouldn't want to repeat last night. Who is he? No one. A refugee like myself. He's called The Count. The Count? That figures. Is he your husband? - No. - What is he so nervous about? If you have to ask, you wouldn't understand. I see. Something to do with your father? What do you know about him? I know who he is. Why are you so interested in my father? Everybody is interested in your father. He's a great man. That's why I want to meet him. He's the only reason you're going to Budapest? No, I'm supposed to do the usual routine, travel notes, that sort of thing. This is my own idea, to do something bigger, more important. Of course, I know it's practically impossible. I won't even be able to find him unless you help me. I'll do better than that. I'll take you to him. What? I'll go with you. That won't be necessary, Julia. I wouldn't want you to risk your neck for me. We could say, I'm your wife. I can't afford one. Especially you. - Your secretary. - I don't need one. - Interpreter? - No. You went to such trouble to look me up. Why, if you don't need me? I forget now. I can be useful to you in so many ways. Don't you want me? Some other time, possibly. If I don't go, you don't go. What are you talking about? - I'll go to the police. - With what? - A lie, anything. - Oh, come on now. - I've done worse things. - Yes, I believe you. Of course, in this case, you can't go near the police. That'd attract too much attention. But, it's a nice thought. I haven't any money! I can't pay you, if that is what you want! I wouldn't cross the border with you for a million bucks! - Why? - Jancsi's daughter? Don't be silly! We both hang! I have to go! I must go! Now, you're nuts, aren't you? You're out. What do you want to go back for? I didn't want to leave! I was forced by him! You don't say! It's true! You can't know! I could tell you things you wouldn't believe! Like what? My father was to meet us at the border. When he wasn't there, I knew he tricked me, to make me go! So I'm here. Safe, free. That's the truth. I wish it wasn't. I don't understand. You couldn't understand. People who are free believe it is the biggest prize of all. You Americans think you invented freedom. You couldn't imagine yourselves settling for less... ...to keep what is left. What is left becomes so important. Look, I didn't bargain for all this. I can't afford to get mixed up in your personal problems. I got plenty of my own. All I want from you is just one thing. Tell me how to find your father. And I'll pay you. To sell him out? No more dramatics? Just keep it simple. A minute ago, you wanted to take me to him. You were lying, weren't you? You wanted to use me to get back. Now come on. How much just to tell me where he is? I've been asked before many times by men like you! Some offered money, some offered love and I have been beaten! I have never told anyone anything! The reason is very personal, Mr. Stevens. I love him! Danke. Excuse, please. Excuse me, Mr. Stevens. I'm sorry I'm late. Dear, I lost my balance! The train is moving so fast! Did you think I was never coming? My mother was so reluctant to see me go. Your mother? I thought I'd never get away. - Yes, she's hard to lose. - She treats me like a child! - Afraid to leave me out alone. - Right from under her nose! Very clever! How'd you work it? She taught me. Where there's a will, there's a way. I brought some fruit in case we get hungry on the long journey. - Do you want one? - Nein, danke-schön. Mr. Stevens? Knock it off, will you? You act like you are on some kind of picnic! I'd like to know what's your plan, Miss... Heinrich. Did you forget? Just fill me in briefly. What's playing, Miss Heinrich? - I want to be of help. - You do? You see, I'm very grateful to you for this trip. Without you, I'd never have such an opportunity. Oh, please! I can't take all the credit. I'm looking forward to new and exciting experiences! Yes, you're given to understatement aren't you, Miss Heinrich? If you have no other duties for me, Mr. Stevens, I will use the time to study my English. That outfit, it's a dinger! Now that you're here, I want you to know I'm glad you decided to make the trip, Miss Heinrich. I think it can be mutually beneficial. What's this? This is the border, Hegyeshalom. Yes. Heinrich, Greta Heinrich. Yes, give me a minute, sir. I am very grateful for you for this trip, Mr. Stevens. Without you, I'd not have the opportunity. Yeah, and Stevens? There is no record in Budapest of your expected arrival with Mr. Stevens. He asked me to accompany him very suddenly. There was no time to advise the authorities. Yes, interesting. You write in English. You only speak English. Why? I have to practice. The man I am working for is an American. Yes, a very valid reason. Couldn't it be you are afraid to speak German? - No, why? - We shall see. We have a most remarkable man on our staff here. Formerly Professor of Languages and Phonetics at the University. By merely listening to a voice, he can tell not only what country, but the province, the county, the town or village the very street on which a man was born. Remarkable! Now Miss Heinrich, I trust you admire poetry as much as I do. I have a poem here I like particularly. Now will you come over here and read it for me, please! In German, of course. The Viennese accent is so delightful. I love hearing it. I hope you'll excuse my absence, Mr. Stevens. - My apologies. A cigarette? - No, thanks. - So many things to see to. - Red tape, I think you call it. - The same in every country. - Well, not exactly. Look, I don't mean to criticize, I want to keep an open mind but we've been stuck here for over an hour! - When is post time? - I beg your pardon? When do we get out of here? In a very short time, I assure you. One question, Mr. Stevens. This Miss Heinrich, she says she's with you. Why have you brought her? She's my interpreter and secretary. But surely you were informed you would be provided with a secretary-interpreter in Budapest? I like to choose my own. Do guests in America usually refuse the hospitality of their host? No, you don't understand. There are personal things, like a tooth brush, you just can't borrow. When I work, my secretary is like my right arm. Miss Heinrich suits me. I wouldn't think of going without her. I see you are true to type. An individualist, Mr. Stevens. I regret, I have to excuse myself once more for just a moment. Miss Heinrich is right next door. Perhaps you'd like her company, while you are waiting? Come in, Miss Heinrich. Excuse me. Please be seated. I won't be long. - Take it easy. - I can't. It's all right. Four score and seven years ago our forefathers. My love, my own, my sweet, my... Read this page, please. Fe... No, I refuse! This is nonsense! I will not! Read it! Just as a favor to the Professor. He is really interested. You should be flattered. Please. Fenster, Strasse, Gebaude, Fiaker, Leder, Feder, Wetter... Good! Excellent! - Is she...? - Authentic, quite authentic. But you lived in Munich at one time or went to school there. I studied there, yes. For my teaching degree. Of course! A school teacher. Very precise, correct. That explains it. A pleasure meeting you, Miss Heinrich. - Beautiful city, isn't it? - Just like Chicago. I enjoyed the journey with you. Thank you. Auf Wiedersehen. Excuse me. Don't try it, Julia! You're with me, remember? - Mr. Stevens? - Yes. I am Kovacs, Olga. The Peoples Society for Peace and Friendship. How do you do? You will meet Sakenov, Ferenc, from the Ministry of Culture. - How do you do? - How do you do? And his assistant, Monar, Peter. - How are you? - How do you do? Tereny, Micolas, Protective Society. - How do you do? - How are you? And this is my secretary, Miss Heinrich. You are unexpected, but see a bouquet of welcome in time. Thank you. Your traveling companion, Karvay, Bela, joins us. Yes, we've met. Would you please come? Thank you. You leave the key here if you go out and when you are returning. What's the matter? Doesn't she trust me? For your protection, Mr. Stevens. Yes, of course! Thank you. I hope your rooms are pleasing. In America, the hotels are not so traditional. Not so beautiful, yes? Not so traditional, yes. - Miss Heinrich, you are here. - Thank you. - Don't be long now. Fine. - I'll join you in a moment. - Mr. Stevens? - Thank you. Please. Thank you. Well... Isn't this something? Now, Mr. Stevens, look! Thank you. Private, for your convenience. A private bathroom to yourself. I don't deserve it. Beautiful, yes? A museum piece! Hungarian champagne? Wonderful! Thank you. We're glad to see you in our country, Mr. Stevens. Please enjoy this visit and send enthusiastic articles to your newspaper! We are anxious to welcome tourists from the United States. Here, they will find beautiful cities, the finest hotels and resorts. And in the mountain, health resorts, various entertainments and vacation pleasures. To these, we add the famous mineral baths. We have planned many things for you to see. Our farms, our factories and cultural activities as well. You will meet the worker in the city, on the farm. You will see, he has many benefits unknown to workers in other countries. He is happy! The present intellectual class of Hungary doesn't despise work with the hands. Unlike the former intellectuals, we are now dedicated to a great ideal, building socialism! We are volunteers! Volunteers, united in friendship and peace. Every living person, young or old, working together to build a new world where all share prosperity, the same privileges. I'm a worker in the Ministry of Culture. I am the same as the worker in the factory or on the farm. Excuse me for interrupting like this, but I seem to be just about out of champagne. The toast is interesting, the host is forgetting. I've been listening intently and I must say my curiosity is at fever pitch! - When do we start? - Tomorrow. Can you wait? Hardly, ma'am. Naturally, I boned up on everything before I took off, but you must know how excited I feel tonight on the threshold of the real thing. In fact, if I may, I'd like to propose a toast. To the real thing! Yes, sir! You talk about peace and friendship. I'll say this. If we can get down on all fours and yak-yak, it'll do more good than your summits, peace-wise. Just kick it around, you know what I mean? Put the milk out, see if the cat licks it up. Nobody buys. Just try it on for size. Put out the old feelers, right? Anything wrong? Not at all. I just reminded Mr. Sakenov of an appointment. Oh. I am sorry to cut off your remarks, Mr. Stevens, - but I beg to be excused. - Sure, I understand! Business before pleasure, right? Yes, I wish also to say I look forward to tomorrow the official start of your visit. The same goes... I want to say good night to Miss Heinrich. Where is she? Oh, the little lady? She must have a headache or something. Long trip, you know. I'll tell her you all said good night. Sleep well in this luxury! Tomorrow we have more impressive to startle your eyes! I'll be there! I'll see you mañana! - Thank you. Good night, all! - Good night. Thank you very much. Good night, sir. Be my guest! Well, a late-stayer? What is this? May I see your passport, please? - Now? What for? - It is necessary. It is? Alrighty! - Where are you going? - Out. - Is that all right? - Of course. - Why are you going out? - To eat. What do you do? I'm assistant to Mr. Sakenov of the Ministry. I have an office and a telephone. Congratulations. You have been to many places. Do you like travel? Do you? No, I am a worker. I have not the time. - Some day, I'll go to Moscow. - It's a very big city, Moscow. Yes, so I've heard. I'm terribly busy. - Would you mind... - You like jazz? - Some other time. - I hear Armstrong. - Not so skilled as Kolovsky. - No? Would you like to hear? I'll take you. Not tonight, I'm tired. Very good music. Plenty of girls. Good beer. Look, find somebody your own age to play with. There'll be other nights, old chap. We'll paint the town red. - Paint the town red? - It's just an expression. It means have fun. Okay? - Okay. - Okay. I'll see you later, okay? Okay. - Okay. - Okay. Toodle-oo! Your name? Robert Stevens. The truth, please! Your name? Come, Mr. Reynolds! We know all about you! Then this initiation was no mistake? No mistake, Mr. Reynolds. Say, you get around, don't you? Yes! I remember you said you'd kill me. Is that why I'm here? Five are in favor. One, undecided. - Where is Julia? - I must warn you, Mr. Reynolds. Be very careful when you talk about her. Whatever you say, you narrow your chances. Then you are Jancsi. Five men in this room risked their lives to get her out to safety. And you brought her back! Now you understand the position, you'll be able to answer some questions. Your pose as a newspaperman. It must be someone of consequence to be able to make all these arrangements. Who is it? Who sent you? Why don't you answer? Who sent you?! Well, I see you got here. Yes, Mr. Reynolds. Unfortunately for you, she did. Now we can keep you here until we find out who sent you. Herman Sheffler, Swiss Bank. We know all about Sheffler. Let's get on with it. What do you know about him? He's a meddler, a nuisance. That's all. Why were you sent? To persuade you to leave. And how were you going to persuade me? He left that up to me. Dead or alive? Did he leave that up to you, too? I gathered you'd be no use to him dead. And how did you gather that? He wants the names of members and plans of your organization. - For what purpose? - He didn't say. Incredible! You knew he wanted this information, yet you didn't ask for what purpose? These names are living people. Still you didn't care! No, I didn't care! How much did he pay you? - Sixty thousand. - All at once? No. Half now, half when I got you out. A wise precaution. Did Herr Sheffler instruct you to persuade Julia to come with you? - No, he didn't. - It was your idea? - I didn't want her... - But she convinced you! She overpowered you, physically? Now wait a minute! When she wanted to come, I decided... You decided to use her to insure the second 30,000 for your pocket! All right, yes. How long is your visit to be, officially? Two more days. The twenty-first. All right. You'll take her back with you. - No! - Now, wait a minute! Whatever happens, she'll have to continue as his secretary for the present. She must return to the hotel. She can't just disappear. They'll be looking for her. - He's right. - Excuse me. I have a meeting at the Ministry. Tomorrow, we inspect a factory together, you and I. Ironic, isn't it? It's no use, father! I'm not going back! I'm staying here! You talk so foolish! You know better! I want to be with you! You know it's impossible! All right, I'll go back to the hotel. I'll be Miss Heinrich for two more days. But only for two days. Then I come back here, father, to stay! You see the suffering you cause! Why don't they both get out? That would be convenient, wouldn't it? You've made arrangements! Certain plans to deliver me from my enemies into the hands of Herr Sheffler! You overlooked one thing only. I don't choose to leave my country. Sir, you don't have a choice. Your time is up. If that is so, Mr. Reynolds, I'll die here. Why do you have to die? What for? I don't believe in it! Look, I came here to save your neck and I'm gonna do it even if you don't want it saved! Whatever I do with my life is my own business. - No one else's! - You don't understand! In a few days, you won't have a life! We know our position better than you do. No, you don't. Sheffler is a pipeline. If he says, I've got two days to get you out you've got two days! Now, you can wait here like sitting ducks or you can do something. But, there's a way out! If you're reasonable, you'll take it. There's no profit for you. Don't bother about us. All right, I'm being paid. I know, you'd like it better if I was some great humanitarian who believed in your cause. I don't even know what your cause is. That shouldn't surprise us. Who does outside this room? You could yell your heads off. Nobody would hear you! They aren't listening! They're all like me, I promise you. They couldn't care less. Causes are outmoded! Everybody is learned to live by compromise. Why can't you? There's isn't any compromise! To compromise is to doubt your own convictions. If they're worth having, they're unshakable. Convictions are fine if you live. Mr. Reynolds, if I can live one day to save one person that's enough. But, you can do more than that on the outside! Unless, you're determined to die a martyr and a crackpot! I wouldn't do that if I were you, my friend. You might need me. You ready, Julia? All right, Julia. I'm not what I seem and there is no Santa Claus. What are you gonna do? Life is real, life is earnest you should know that. It isn't that you're not what you seemed to be, it's what you are. A schnook? I got his vote, too. It's unanimous. So we can forget about me. Let's talk about you. No. You have never felt anything for anyone else, have you? I never get involved, no. Your life must be very empty. Not to me. In my work, I have to go it alone. I don't mind. I like it. What do you do when you are not working? Play the horses. Does that compensate for everything? Look, you can figure out what makes me tick some other time? What about you? What's gonna happen to you? There's one thing you don't realize about me. Just call me Mike. - We don't want the same things. - We don't? I have no wish to leave my father. Whatever he's doing for what he believes in I would do, too, because I believe in him. And you're as stubborn, too. See that she is safe! Good night, sir! Hiya, ol' buddy! Whatta you say? So, you! Where are you? This is highly serious matter! I should arrest you for losing my protection! Where have you go? I demand you! No, don't be an old sorehead! Everybody, up to my place. We'll have a party! - I demand you! - No offense, old buddy. No offense. I love ya, baby! Give us a little kiss, whatta you say? Hurry! You can't play the races without the scoring card! Peanuts, popcorn, fresh candy bars! Now I have here a package of delicious, nutritious, chocolate-covered bonbons! Twenty-five cents, one quarter of a dollar and in each and every package a delightful little novelty guaranteed to captivate and activate every one of you gentlemen! Hello Mother, it's you! Drunk? Stevens and Heinrich reporting, sir. Zero-one-hundred! Ten medium bombers, one Spitfire not bad in this fog? Top secret! I forgot myself! It won't happen again, sir! One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four... Good night, Miss Heinrich, honey! All alike, buddy? You buy them dinner and then nothing! You are trapped, Miss Heinrich, my sweets! Good night! One, two, three, four, one, two, three, four... Love ya, baby! Room 21, please. Ja. Hi. Oh, it's you. You all right? Yes. Did I wake you? Why do you call me? You shouldn't use the phone. It's all right if they listen. This is strictly business. I get some of my best ideas late at night. I sort of dream them up and unless I can dictate them right away, they're gone up the flue. You know how it goes... Wait a minute. I think I got company. I'll call you back. What is it? Open the door, please. - I'll get you a doctor! - No time. Your room wired. In there, talk in there. Get to Jancsi. Take Julia. Laszlo arrested. Talking, hurry! No time. Come on, honey. Room 21, please. Miss Heinrich, like I was saying about dreaming up things at night. Well, I just had a beaut! Now, wait. Listen. Listen, take this down. There was this man, see? And he was hurt. Then I came out and I saw him running toward your door. You got it? Okay, I haven't got a finish yet. Bitte kommen Sie. Ein mann da drauss. Schnell, bitte! Kommen Sie zum Fenster. What has happened? Sakenov! He's dead! Get dressed! You ready? When we get out, leave me. I can get there. - No. - I'll take care of myself. You shut up. Come on. It's all right. Thank you, Father. Thank God, you are here! I have a message. Laszlo's arrest? We know about that. Now, we've got to move fast! We'll go separately. Hurry! You and I go last. Mr. Reynolds! - I'll be right there. - Right. Where are we going? We use a farmhouse in the country. How far? By the back roads, 100 kilometers. Why? You have a better idea? It'll have to wait. It's too soon. Wait! Don't come with us! - Why not? - They'll be looking for us. Alone, you might easily get away. What's the point? Why are you telling me all this? I'm offering you a way out! If you are caught with us, you die with us! A ridiculous farce, don't you agree? - Maybe not. - What does that mean? I don't know. If you're finished, let's go. - Take care. - And you. Sándor! This is the moment if ever there was a moment for gloating. It is a pleasure to deal with intelligent men who accept the inevitable without the usual denials of outraged innocence. Gloating, protesting, they're time-wasters for imbeciles! Gentlemen, I have been entrusted with the task of gaining your confidence. To be precise, a full confession from Mr. Stevens to be used in the people's court. And from you, Jancsi, the names of the members in your organization. You know the usual methods. The beatings, the brilliant lights, endless questions interspersed with more beatings, nail and teeth extractions, all the crude techniques. I've done all the talking thus far, gentlemen. Forgive me. If you're ready, I'm willing to listen now. You know who I am? Yes. Colonel Hidas, isn't it? You remember me. Only vaguely. Understandable. I was not so advanced in those days, but you became my personal ambition, obsession, if you like. I saw my colleagues fail and I determined to succeed where they had failed. My assistant, gentlemen. Genuine coffee, gentlemen. Of course, it contains a chemical. At first, you will feel stimulated, but it will come nausea, dizziness and a certain mental confusion. Drink. Drink! In the course of time, we achieve quite remarkable results. There is no exception. Keep your head up. For God's sake, Reynolds, lift your head! Keep it up! I told you to keep it up! Keep it up! That's better. Don't let go. Amazing! Julia! Major Horvath? Is he alone? Yes, but he's busy. You know what to say! Yes? - Is everything all right? - It's all right. Dismiss! Virga Prison. Colonel Hidas. - But your appointment, sir? - Not now. Commandant, I wish to... After you, Commandant. I hope the Commandant expects to find them in this condition for your sake, Colonel. Why are they being taken? The Commandant seemed angry. Something about important prisoners sent to you instead of him. Some mistake. I never make a mistake! Very fortunate. - Get him! - Wait! I have authority here! Tell the Commandant you had a delay. I need one hour. Very well. I have no personal objections if you will call the Commandant for permission. Perhaps the Commandant would not be agreeable. But you're clever enough, Major, to explain an unfortunate delay. You'd be rewarded. I'll see to that. A bribe? Sorry, Colonel. Arrest him! - Quickly! - Julia... - Not here? - Yes. - Where is she? - This way. - What is this? - Keep moving! I'd like a match! Thank you. Attention! Get me the female prisoner two-four-five. Where is the release from Colonel Hidas? I have no time! The Commandant's orders, you fool! We've got about 30 minutes, let's go! Let them go! Go! Let them get to the wire! Get down! Come on! Keep going. Hang on! Get them! Good to see you, my boy! Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome aboard European Airlines, special flight One-Oh-Four to Vienna.
