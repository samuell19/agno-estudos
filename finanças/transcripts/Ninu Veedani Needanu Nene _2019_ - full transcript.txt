Ok dear, we'll talk later - Bye - Bye Yes... Thanks for the appointment, doctor We are studying Para Psychology in Osmania University Third year students I know Err...professor Seetharam had informed me Tell me. What can I do for you? Doctor, we are doing a research under the topic 'Logical mind and super natural force' We analyzed many super natural cases Some are unbelievable For example... A four year old girl, Manisha, who was born and raised in Delhi She says that her name is Suman and her parents are in Rajasthan She even identified the parents in Rajasthan I'll just add to this A girl named Suman lived in that house and... she died five years ago How is it possible, doctor? We were blown away by these facts When we discussed about it with our professor... An unusual case unlike these... he told that you handled it while you were still practising Would you mind telling us about that case? It would be really helpful for our project And we really are curious to know. Our world is full of surprises It is full of surprises and mysteries I feel anything is possible in this world of ours We just have to keep our minds open, like a parachute... and then believe... and later on accept Ok. Coming to the case that you're talking about A case that I'm very emotionally connected to It made me think about science twice I think it was in the year 2019 We represent 'Smile' Foundation.

Nothing Nothing Hey, are you ok? I'm really hungry and sleepy - I'll make something - Ok - Come. - I'm so hungry. Are you okay? Sandwich is really good! I'm seeing someone else in the mirror Could it be some spirit? If Diya finds out... Why is this guys photo in my Whats app display picture?

We will be safe Nothing will happen. Look at me, Diya Don't look into the mirror!! Look at me I need to show you something too What is it? Please don't panic. Don't get scared while looking at it. Diya! Diya! Since 30 minutes... Even I'm seeing someone else's reflection in the mirror I was afraid of telling it to you I'm going mad. Look! Look over there! Don't look at it. Diya, don't look there It's ok It's ok Who are they? This is happening since we returned from that graveyard Even Facebook and Whats app DP has his photos Well... I didn't tell you this because you might get scared But I think the spirit that has possessed me was trying to talk to me Don't panic!! - Can you just try it? Close your ears - No! No Rishi Diya, please It is important if you are also able to hear such sounds Please... Try it. Hello, I... It's ok! It's ok. It's ok It's ok Try it once again Hello... - It's ok!

Why is my lady upset in the early hours? Diya? What happened? I had a nightmare where I was about to kill you I might get violent and... I'm afraid she might hurt you Don't cry Even I'm possessed You think he'll keep quiet if you harm me? On a more serious note I guess only we are seeing different people in mirror Else our friends must have seen the different photos and called us by now In any case... I have booked an appointment at a hypnotism centre Iâ€™ll go there and check out this issue. In the meanwhile, why don't you meet the church father? No! No! I'll come with you Diya...Diya! You have to stay strong Don't cry Ok? - Excuse me - Yes... Can you dust that photo please - Too much of dust in it - Ok There is no dust in it. The color of the shirt gives such an impression Mr.Rishi... You went to the graveyard Also, you saw a burning corpse Then you returned home Your tension, fear and pressure would have raised That is why you feel such things happening to you Then about different photos in your Facebook and Whats app... Its all your imagination It's normal only if you are facing these issues What's strange and funny is that even your wife is facing the same Look, I hold a Ph.D in Hypnotherapy I'll clear your issue in fraction of seconds Go sit on that sofa Anyway, it's a thrilling experience to attend patients like you Why are so scared? Look into the mirror Sir... I'm scared to look into the mirror I'm right here with you. Right> Now, be brave and look into the mirror The girl I see in the mirror, did she die and has her spirit possessed me, father? You may leave, sister There is a word called 'Holy spirit' mentioned in Bible Which means spirits that are pure and good Spirits that serve Gods are called Angels Spirits that work against God are called Demons, that is Satan There is no link between those holy spirits and the soul of the deceased We don't call our soul as Satan. In fact we call it a ghost As far as the Bible is concerned, only after a human dies... there is a judgment in the God's court Whether an individual's soul goes to heaven or hell... is decided based on the good and bad deeds of that individual A deceased human's soul possessing another human and performing good and bad deeds... Well, nothing of that sorts is mentioned in Bible Yet there are many super natural occurrences 400 years ago, in a village near Greece... A small child saw the reflection of man in a mirror The villagers got scared and killed that boy It was recorded and archived in a library. I'm witnessing something that I have read Rishi... I'm going to hypnotize you and find out what's inside your mind. Ok? I'll find out about the guy in the mirror from your inner mind and... based on that I'll decided what treatment you'll need Concentrate on my thumb Concentrate Focus on my thumb finger! You are concentrating on my thumb Now you are sleeping... Sleeping... Okay... Relax Have you ever met the guy whom you are seeing on the mirror? What happened at the graveyard? Answer me Your silence won't help me. Tell me and only then I can do something If you are silent, how can we resolve the problem? Excuse me, at least you tell me. How did you possess him? Hello! Excuse me! If both of you are sleeping... Who is gonna answer me? As technology keeps advancing... realistic horror films and YouTube videos related to paranormal activities... makes the people believe in ghosts You don't have to fear this Medical facilities have improved a lot I'm sure there will be treatment for this When such problems pop up... Have faith in God... Go ahead trusting Him. Donâ€™t be afraid. You'll be alright God bless you, child This is a very complicated case. If you don't co operate... You will face the trouble. You are a goner if public knows about it. Try to understand Try to understand the situation, Rishi. - Hey Baldie - Yes. Are you sane? Why are you nagging him when he is asleep? Is he in your control? You are hypnotist doctor? Any exhausted man will sleep on such a chair. You hype it as control? I'll slap you! What happened? Nothing I saw peeping through... Why are you guys so irresponsible? I have been calling you both since last night and none of you are attending You have no idea how upset I am! We thought we'll text you but then dozed off to sleep! Diya! Your looks tell me that something is fishy - Let me call him and talk to him - Aunty..aunty... I was planning to call you... - Rishi slipped in the bathroom - What?! He slipped in the bathroom? Do you have any sense? You should have called me, instead you are uttering non sense. But how did he slip? - Hello? - Hello, Rishi! Hello? Just a minute, Diya Let me turn on the Bluetooth Can you hear me? Why aren't you attending my calls? My head is bursting in tension I was with the doctor - How can I attend calls when he is examining me? - Ok What did the doctor say? He said medicine will solve the issue What did the church father had to say? His answer was not clear. He said there's nothing to worry I forgot to tell you - You mom just left. - Mom came there? Yes, she rebuked for not taking the calls. I somehow managed her saying you slipped in the bathroom - So, maintain that - Ok. I'll take care I'll manage Rishi, I'm afraid to be all alone at home Come home quickly Let me go to that graveyard and check if any couple had died You don't worry. I will come soon. Excuse me Did you attend any couples corpse yesterday, aging around 30-35 years? The cop just took my son away asking the same question Wonder who is that good-for-nothing couple who died and are creating trouble for us! Only two corpses were brought yesterday That too both were old aged people You people are torturing us with your questions Get lost! Thank you How is it possible, doctor? I saw someone else in the mirror instead of my daughter-in-law? Could...could... could this be a ghost? Do we need to consult an exorcist? I am confused since I look into that mirror It's not so easy for every doctor to come across such a case So, what we should do, to begin with this... Let's do a complete body scan for Diya Call up your son and ask him to bring her here? - Ok. - Put it on the speaker mode - Ok doctor Diya, what are you doing now? I'm scared to see a different face on our photos It's foolish to get scared of this. Everything is gonna be ok. Promise! My mom's calling Hello Hello! Hello Where are you , Rishi? Mom, well...err...I slipped in the bathroom - Sorry, sir - It's ok Listen! When I came to your house today morning... I saw someone else in the mirror reflection of Diya I was truly shocked to see that Something is fishy there I just spoke to the doctor regarding this. Do one thing... bring Diya to Apollo hospital right away Mom... This is not just Diya's problem Even I... see someone else's refection in the mirror So Rishi... To begin with... the reports seem to be normal when I look at this Andcit is not a hypnotical issue It's a psychological problem Then whose reflection is it on the mirror? Coming to that But before that you have to understand this clearly Ghosts are a myth The soul of a deceased person is what we address as ghost Soul is nothing but a beautiful memory Just like the sunlight, rain and the breeze that touches us Do you feel any scientific changes in your hormones? or any memory leak in the brain? I just can't comprehend now But we will get to it. I must admit it. In this segment, one of the rarest case I have ever seen One in a ten million is born with two heads Some grow very well though their brains don't grow much I see this as a similar problem I'm surprised by the fact that both of you are facing the same issue Ask me the treatment and medication for this... then honestly I don't know I have to study about it hereafter Doctor, I almost forget While talking I could feel some sound overlapping Not when I speak normally but when I talk over a call or close my ears An irritating noise That's nothing First time you saw someone else's reflection in the mirror and that made you feel so We call it hallucination Hearing an echo while closing ears and speaking is common We can treat with medicines. Not to worry Doctor... One last question what if the person I see in he mirror... turns violent? Any chances? Just come with me. Let's go near the mirror - Doctor.. Don't be scared. Come. It's ok Ok, here is a deal The person we see instead of Rishi.. if he breaks the mirror and kill us? We'll also comeback as ghosts and kill everyone Ok? Rishi, come. It's ok. Come on Whoa Rishi! This is magic! Doesn't look like the grotesque ghosts from the movies He too looks normal, just like you That's what I'm saying. Nothing to be scared now Just look at him. Come Doctor... who is the one I'm seeing in the mirror? Is he alive or dead? At least if we can get that information... we'll at least be peaceful Yeah. Sit I'll ask the Assistant commissioner of the police to come here We'll ask him to find out if the person is alive or dead You'll also be relieved I'll also get a clarity in the treatment! Okay? - Subba Reddy! - Sir? It's a ghost! Don't frighten me. We are cops. - Be brave. - Sir? Mr. ACP... This is my best opportunity to prove that ghosts are a myth Whose reflection is it on the mirror? I want to find out if such a man exists, sir Not to worry, doctor If such a person exists... then we can find out for sure Just a second This device is called EVP Short for Electronic Voice Phenomena This device will sense any paranormal sounds or if any ghost speaks In Hollywood movies, in order to decode the voice of ghosts some hefty machines will be showcased This is the smaller version. Rishi, if you don't mind, talk something I'm Rishi. My wife's name is Diya Let's play it to see if it has recorded anything. I have to discuss with sir regarding your protection - I'll see you tomorrow, Rishi - Ok sir - Take care - Thank you - Nice meeting you, ACP sir. - Be brave Thank you I was scared that it might be some ghost, doc Instead of Rishi we are seeing someone else's reflection in the mirror If not a ghost then what do you think it is? But you said it was a medical condition How can a doctor tell his patient that he is possessed by a ghost? How can I tell that you are possessed by a ghost? So I lied that it was a medical problem. Hope you understand. This is a dummy. It's a normal recorder. This is that actual recorder. It would have recorded it for sure Let's play this and observe Hi... I'm sure it's the voice of the person whom Rishi is seeing in the mirror Usually such sounds are heard only during the sleep mode - Subba Reddy! - Sir? We have to discuss something personal - Go out - Ok, sir - Please lock the door - Ok, sir Doctor... - Sir... - What happened, sir? Do you know that it's a ghost? - Indeed yes. - What? How can you call me despite know this? How can you do that? If he could just asked me to find out the man in the reflection by messaging on What's App I could have inferred and replied back Why did you make me its enemy? How can you do that? It has identified me Will it spare me? It will swear me And will thrash me, isn't it? Sir, a small request I will strive hard and find the man in the reflection nab him and will hand him over to you At least I'll find him Please take care of the ghost Since childhood till now I haven't seen any ghost movie I used to pee when someone mentions it FYI my pants are already wet Won't cops fear the ghosts? -Even CM will fear ghosts - Take care! Do you think we are specially trained to nab the ghosts? No more patients please They should have called en exorcist for such cases What the hell I can do? God! Make sure that he doesn't notice Even my enemy shouldn't face situation Did he notice me? Seems he is following me? God, please save me He has spot me He is following me Why is he following me? Why are you following, sir? What do you have in your mind? Oh God! I am not the usual cop that you always come across I don't take bribes I have...never harmed any of the prisoners People make fun of me saying that I'm suppose to be a primary school teacher I have been talking for quite some time Why don't you reply, sir? Didn't you suggest the doctor to send us to an exorcist? And you wanna play innocent now? An exorcist can... resolve your problems I wanted to help you I was not thinking of separating you both Right, sir? Where are yo... Where did he, go, sir? Where is this gentleman? Sir...sir... What happened sir? Why are you blabbering all alone? What? Blabbering all alone? Darn! Sir! - Sir... you left you phone. - Oh?! - Thank you.. thank you so much - Welcome Rishi... come on. What are you upto, Rishi? You came to me with a problem And now you are trying to scare me? Doctor, you told I had a medical condition I was waiting outside the hospital corridor, doctor Later, I saw AC He was all scared talking to himself looking all around I didn't understand anything He was scared as if he saw a ghost I felt that you're hiding something from me Hence, I was trying to scare you and you didn't react I can't think of any brilliant idea beyond this I just want to know the truth Tell me "Rishi, this is just medical condition and there is no ghost" I'll trust that and leave But please be frank Please Rishi, you what is the responsibility of a good doctor? To treat the patient without infusing fear A doctor is ought to do it That's what I did But when you have such a clarity, I don't think I have to hide anything from you Yes Rishi, you are possessed by a ghost It's indeed scary to hear this But this feels better At least if the spirit inside me becomes violent... I can prepare myself to save myself See Rishi... we approach every case in a unique way We give immediate results in some cases In some cases we give results by following the trial and error method Now its all about patience Please be patient You will be fine. Trust me. Thanks doctor - Take care - Sorry if I had troubled you Hold on... hold on - Get me two chilled beers - Okay sir Why is he meditating with liquor on the table? Bro! I Mahesh Gunta from Bitaragunta Why are you breaking your head after buying the liquor? You should value the liquor. Please have it. Come on, Cheers! No brother What happened, bro I have an issue Please leave me alone Who is trouble free? Don't I have any? My dad beats me up for getting up late My colleagues scold me for not bathing My project manager scolds me despite my toiling hard Please have it. - Try to understand, brother. - What now? There... is someone inside me. Even now I'm not sure... If I'm talking to you or he is talking. I'm going mad. - Can't risk taking alcohol. - There is just one guy inside you. Do you know how many guys have possessed me? On the third peg Chota bheem comes out Iron man comes out for the 6th peg Hulk on the 10th peg I have rented my body for the Avengers You are nothing when compared to me Have it Please have it If I drink it I'm not sure who'll get high; Me or him? You please enjoy Forget this Let me take a pic Bro... - No photos please - If I spot you again I want to make sure that I won't encounter you again Come on Fair guy What are you searching? Some dumb head interfered while taking a snap with you Where is that dumbo? It's not someone else I told that there is someone inside me It's him Just now I met my doctor Seems the one inside me is a ghost If you are fine with the ghosts Let's be friends, bro Bro... Why are you crying? I had 7 beers that cost me 3000 bucks Taxes extra I lost the whole kick of it Now I have to redeem having cheap liquor Hello... Is it the liquor shop? Please don't close the shop, I'm on my way Where are we going? ACP sir has found out the details of the guy I see in mirror The doctor had called You noticed this? - Holy ash and vermillion. - So you are not scared of ghosts. Not at all. Very good, ACP sir. Do you know the ghosts hate anything related to God? - What? - Really? - They hate this? - Yes God! Hello, doctor Rishi, come on in - Hello, Rishi! - Hi, sir! - Hello, sir - Come sit - Take your seat - Sir Sir, who is he? How did you find out? This accident happened 4 days ago It happened in the outskirts of Hyderabad Hence we were able to trace it fast Did you recently take the Chevella road while traveling by car? Yes, recently while I was returning from Vikarabad... I used that road In fact we visited a graveyard nearby We even noticed a dead body burning Same spot The graveyard or the burning corpse has nothing to do with your issue That's a death spot A young couple, Arjun and Madhavi were there Both of them died on the spot The couple who died on the spot... Arjun and Madhavi It's them whom you are seeing in the mirror... - Subba Reddy - Sir Take a look. So, four days ago... It was both of us, who died in an accident? So am I seeing this world by possessing him? So, I'm the ghost? Doctor, so you were narrating us the story of Arjun, who actually died? This is the specialty of this case Arjun died and possessed Rishi... but he was under the impression that Rishi had possessed him Arjun was terrified! Sir sorry but just a minute Then what was all about him seeing Rishi's reflection in the mirror? The fact is that, it was Rishi who was seeing Arjun's reflection in the mirror Everyone of us saw Arjun in the mirror This was a big shock to Arjun I'm Arjun... and you're Madhavi, it seems Why aren't we aware of our own identities? Then who's Rishi and Diya? Why did we possess them? So, basically we are looking at everyone through Rishi and Diya's point of view So, guess everyone... must have seen us in the mirror, right? Rishi and Diya would've seen us in their selfies and in the mirror Similarly, when they got worried and checked their Facebook and Whats app profile... it was actually us, who reacted to it This is not our house We met Rishi's parents This is not our life Where did we live? Where are our parents? What are we doing here? Doctor! Wait...Sorry but... I'm visualizing your narration... but why am I seeing Arjun? Logically, Arjun must be inside the mirror world and... I must be visualizing Rishi, right? I am narrating you Arjun's story from Arjun's point of view So, naturally you'll visualize him Your visualization is perfectly fine Just continue with it And you'll understand it easily Arjun! Why are we still in their body? Why haven't we left their bodies yet? Yeah right! Ask me like I'm an expert who keeps possessing a new body everyday Even I'm confused here Madhavi... until now, we always ran away from the mirror Why don't we try talking to them through mirror? Let me go and try that You go and try it out in the mirror in bedroom Hi Rishi Hi... Ouch! What's wrong with him? Boss! Why are you so scared? Escape... Are you nuts? I'm a ghost! Don't you watch horror movies? I am better at using your body than you do! Better? Don't be afraid! Are you able to hear and understand me? Stop being afraid. Are you able to hear and understand me? I can hear you very clear, bro! I'm shivering in fear! I'm don't feel like peeing yet I'm in the bathroom... and standing in front of the mirror I know you are the one who is making me do it Please, leave me bro Brother! Please don't be scared of me. I'm not like the violent ghosts you see in the movie I'm just like you I swear, I don't remember how I possessed you, brother Only if we find that out... we'll get an idea about how can I leave your body I'm so relieved that we are able to communicate Let's discuss and find out a solution Did you travel along the Chevalla road 4 days ago? Yes! We had been to a resort in a nearby village We had chicken 65, mutton chops and drank lassi Then we set back to home We saw a car crashed I approached the car if someone inside would need help But there were no one inside the car So I picked my phone to call the cops - Then I felt a shock! - Hello! Hello! My wife is an ardent fan of horror movies On the way to the graveyard nearby, I wanted to prank her After returning from there, we started seeing you in mirror I thought you possessed me when I was at the graveyard I went and checked there Only two corpses were brought yesterday That too both were old aged people The police was investigating the undertaker on that day Now I realize it is to investigate your death case I also met with an accident and I also pranked my girlfriend After returning home, I saw you in the mirror This is what even I remember How about we go, explain this to doctor and see if he can give us a solution? I'm sure he'll give us some idea Oh, come on! You always show up with some new facts I just gave it a try and it worked out Just a try? Yes sir Good Who's talking to me now? Sir, it's Arjun Sure? Sure! Arjun, this is a huge positive! So, tell me. How did you possess Rishi? Sir, I came seeking you to find that out I don't remember anything Like my identity, my life, my parents and my friends Why am I seeing Rishi's mother as mine and living his life? I came to you to find out these things The problem here is that... you haven't realized that you're dead But in reality, you're dead and have possessed Rishi Your memory is not active Rishi's memory is active Which is why you are living Rishi's life Right? Let's do one thing Let's revive your memory Arjun, go to your house Try to meet your parents If you're able to recollect them... then with that result we can try to sort out this case. I'll see to it Sir, why do you look tensed? Commissioner ordered me to handle Arjun's case Subba Reddy ran away hearing that Commissioner said " Didn't you speak to Arjun in the mirror..." "So, ask him and find out if this is an accident or murder and close the case" - Hello. Who is speaking? - Sir... Sir, it's me, Rishi Sir! Sir...err...Rishi sir? One minute. Turn around! Now, close your ears! - Tell me, sir - Do you have Arjun's address? I do! I do have his address I'll message you the address A small request Sir...err...Rishi sir, who gave you this number? The doctor gave it to me My God! - Catch it! Out! - Yay! Out! - That was trials! - You're out! - Talk too much and I'll leave with my bat! - Come on! Play fair! You're out! Arjun! Don't go out alone! You can't carry it downstairs - I'll be safe. - Let me come. - Wait - Bye, mom. - Wait, Arjun - What is it, mom? - I'll come, see you off at the van - No need, mom My friends will taunt me - Bye mom! - Wait Arjun... sit and wear it! - Take your lunch box - Lunch box? No need mom I'm not in school anymore. I'll have it in the college canteen That's my house, brother This is where I grew up I'm gonna meet my parents for the first time after my death I'm nervous He has left us Have some water I have never seen my mom like this before My dad's my best friend, brother And he is weeping over there And I am even unable to console them Sorry brother I'm unable to control the tears I've no idea how to console you, brother. Please don't cry So your memory is back, bro? My father is a professor My mom is a house wife My mom heads the family We were a happy family My dad and me would booze together But we good as dead if caught by mom - He said it was a medicine - Aren't you sane enough to say 'no'? - Your son made me drink - Hey stop! I met Arjun while pursuing MBA And we instantly clicked Our love affair was quite popular in the college campus But Arjun's fury was even more popular But he used to oblige me " Excuse me, my devilish baby" "Why are you despondent?" " Hello, I'm sorry" "Forgive me once" "Let's go chill... This our itinerary" " why are you you furious my lady..." "You a paved my new path" "With your kind rebukes" "You stole my heart, beauty" "You increased my momentum " "And I lost myself in your quest" " Excuse me, my devilish baby" " You're my fantasy" " Oh my love!" " You're my ecstasy" " Excuse me, my devilish baby" " You're my fantasy" " Oh my beauty!" " You're my ecstasy" " Hello, I'm sorry!" "Forgive me once" "Let's go chill... This our itinerary" "Every moment with you is a boon" "Who turned on this magic?" "Every moment is a celebration" "You are the cause of it" "Are you a rebellion" "Who instigated my heart to agitate? " "Shower mercy on men" "Don't begin a war for just a kiss" " Excuse me, my devilish baby" " You're my fantasy" " Oh my beauty!" " You're my ecstasy" " You're my fantasy" "Oh my love" " You're my ecstasy" My dad learnt about us... And disagreed to get us married Even Arjun's father tried a lot to convince him But my dad insulted him badly After this incident Arjun family stopped supporting us as my parents didn't give a nod Hey butterfly! Shall we get married? Shall we get married? Our marriage separated us from our parents For the first time ever, I was worried about my future Madhavi used to talk to her father over phone But I was angry over my mom for not accepting our love So, I completely distanced myself from them For Madhavi's first birthday after our marriage I had planned a surprise for her But only while coming back... Fine, that's enough about me. Tell me about your life, brother I don't know anything about you My life too was very jovial, like yours until you possessed me Every since you possessed me, my life has changed and it feels like I'm under house arrest Sorry brother Brother, other day when Madhavi met the church father... she mentioned a story about a small incident in Greece, that father told her Bro, I thought throughout the night and also checked out in YouTube Spirits leave the body once they go violent If you are ok with it, I shall try getting violent and see if I leave your body Please bro! I peed while watching the video. You want me invite more trouble? No! Let's follow the rules prescribed by the doctor Bro, stop being a chicken! I'll not scare or harm anyone I'll just try becoming violent If it works out, good for us or else we'll just follow doctor's instruction If you are so keen on getting out of my body, what can I do? If you try it But let me tell you few facts about me. Will you note it down? Basically... Walking makes me tired I'll catch a flu if I get drenched in rain I'll catch fever if I get into the swimming poo The sun makes me sweat Apart from these, anything violent you try and I'll lend my full cooperation That's the least I can do. What happened, ,bro? You are showing mixed reactions at one instance. Now, we'll dip our heads in this bath tub We'll hold our breath as long as we can and then when we come out... And when you come out, I'll be gone for good One minute, bro... My mom had warned about dangers in wat... Let me complete my senten... I have asthma! I have vising problem! After living such a great life, do you want my death in the bathroom? If you dip once more, forget about you leaving my body I will leave my body Please show some mercy Brother, looks brand new In fact, I just removed the covering Just after our wedding, I bought it to build my reputation I have gifted this building to her. So, I thought it was unnecessary and stopped it. Why is he increasing his speed,now? You are too... Bro! No! Bro! Listen, I don't have that much stamina! Why are you increasing the speed? At this pace, I can move from end of the city to the other end in an hour Bro! Bro! (Chanting mantras) Listen, you are possessed It's a known fact I'll introduce it to you. You just get rid of him Why is turning around? To whom will he introduce? Here he comes Mr. Priest, please meet Rishi This priest is quiet famous Can you get rid of this ghost? I can't do it Anyone who comes here to get rid of ghost, I beat them with these Neem leaves That's all is required to get rid of the ghost Now, do I beat you with the Neem leaves or do I beat the ghost in the iPad? Tell me! How can you say so? What about my money? Okay fine. Look, take back the 2000 rupees you paid me as advance And this my earnings, today. You may have that too Please leave! I plead you! Lower the window... Do you need the coolers? What's your problem, bro? Don't act naive. If I doze off, I will not wake up for the next 2 days I hearing some noise Like the sound of scrapping coconut... I'm hearing such noise Why are you laughing when I'm getting tormented? Sorry bro Diya, we thought you and Rishi possessed us and... I got scared, so I took all your photos, wrapped up it in a bed sheet What was your mindset like, at that moment? I was really scared thinking it was all done by a ghost I was worried if I did something and what if it made you violent Hence, I kept quiet Hey! Hey! Madhavi! Hey! To wake up someone from deep sleep at unearthly hours... and making him stand in front of the mirror is a crime, you know? If I hire a good lawyer, I can sue you! First, listen to me, bro The other day, when you saw my car met with an accident... did anyone divert your car saying the road is blocked? Let's discuss tomorrow. Why talk about the accident now? Just answer me! Brother, there was no diversion I stopped after seeing a car off road I have to take that route to home I see tears in your eyes. Any recollection of your flashback? Are you gonna tell it to me now? Brother! Brother, please...a small favor We shall start it tomorrow morning and I shall pay complete attention I feel very sleepy, brother. Shall we go to sleep now? Sorry bro... but until I'm here... you'll hardly get any sleep Thank you. Wait...what? Come again! Won't I get sleep? Where are you going? You are forcing on me? You will face the karma Arjun... what are you doing at this hour? Come, let's go, sleep You died in the accident I was murdered! The accident was framed! It was a murder plan! Arjun...please - Calm down! Arjun! - No! I'm not gonna spare anyone who did this - I won't spare anyone! - Arjun.. Arjun! Do you have any sense? You beat the hell out people when you were alive Now, we are dead. Try to understand What if something happens to Rishi because of you? Arjun! If you bash up or murder anyone, Rishi will go to prison! Not you! Won't you even consider all these factors? Why should I? My life was ruined! How can you be so selfish, Arjun? You didn't obey me when we were alive At least please obey me now, Arjun! Please! Please! They must not face any trouble because of you Someone murdered me and ruined my life! If anyone had murdered you... the police will take care of it So, please calm down Why do dead people like us have to get angry or tensed and have emotions? Let's focus on leaving Rishi's and Diya's body Please, listen to me Arjun No! Go! Do as you wish! People say death brings peace But in my case... even after death, I have no peace! I'm sorry Arjun? There was no issue until you didn't recollect anything But now, you have recollecting things. I mean things that are related to you So, Rishi's brain is in a confused state What should I do now, doctor? You can't do anything Just relax Blood vomiting is a normal symptom But we'll sort it out. Don't worry Doctor... Bleeding nose, now is that normal or... did you say that to save the patient from panicking? Why did he have a bleeding nose? Just a minute Here Tap the ball What? Come on. Just try it Ok Don't stop this action Keep tapping that ball and throw this up and catch it Are you serious? Alright Come on. Come on. Yes! No See that? Give different set of actions to your each hand and... it confuses your brain Circus, gymnastics and people who do acrobatics practice for years and... bring their body and mind under control So, if suddenly the brain receives instructions from two people... With both their memories, emotions... Rishi's fear Arjun's anger and vengeance So, when the brain keeps on receiving two sets of instructions... the brain cannot handle it and it'll collapse First time... I was afraid that Rishi's life was in danger But I was unable to share it with them Hence... Where do I begin with? Actually... Rishi's brain has collapsed He had bleeding from nose If this continues, then his life will be in risk Relax. Please don't worry. We'll find a solution What's happening, brother? How did you die? Was it an accident? If it's an accident then why one of the car's windows is broke? And why were there pieces of beer bottle around it? Did you drink and drive? Or did anyone murder you? Sir.. I have a small doubt If we tell him everything then what the heck is he gonna do? Ask him Dear, we know what the heck to do and what not to do Lucky you're a ghost or else I'd have hanged you upside down and ripped you apart - Give it a shot! Come on! Try it! - Aiyo! Oh my God! Give it a shot! Damn! For a second I forgot that he is a ghost! He seems to be very spooky He is shivering for just a scream I'm not sure if he can help us with the case Are you really a ghost? If so, go avenge your death by killing your murderer Instead why are you threatening me, when I'm supporting you? Rishi, it doesn't look like he'll leave you body I'm telling you! Now, leave! Leave! Are you a thug? Trying to scare me? You want me to repeat? I kindly requested you leave his body. Was I wrong? Come Rishi Told you, police is helpless Cops are destined to rot like this Jobs that will be never resurrected - Murthy? - Sir? - I need complete details of Arjun's case - Ok sir I need the complete report of that case on my table within half an hour Get me a report on the car's brake condition before the accident The autopsy report is ready, sir After possessing Rishi, get reports of his movements If I had guessed it right, some gangs would have killed him Don't miss any evidence Listen Arjun! Non co operation to the investigation is unfair I have explained you oftentimes I'm not interested in such investigations Please try to understand the situation, Arjun Sir, I already told you... - Please move - Sorry brother Please move Please stop! Take this route Please move - Hello Arjun, you there? - I'll call you back, doctor Sounds strange, Dr. Eshwar but this is the first time I'm nervous about a surgery It's probably because I'm looking into this case personally Doctor... This surgery you want me to perform is not only complicated but first of it's kind Two persons memories active in one brain! It's highly impossible, doctor You're asking me to treat a super natural thing with science Not just that Rishi's brain cells, tissue, nerves are completely damaged I don't even understand, how he is alive! To be very honest with you doctor... We don't even have a 10% chance that this surgery will be a success Not just that, Rishi's life is also at high risk Then it's up to you You know what Dr. Eshwar... Even if we avoid the surgery then he'll survive maximum for 10-15 days So, we might as well take a chance and believe that miracles do happen Then let's do it, doctor. Let's give it a shot Dr. Eshwar is quiet efficient He'll perform a small surgery on Rishi The you will be dumped off from his memory Please arrange for the surgery at once, doctor Rishi's family is already very much worried Let them be peaceful at least And so, my chapter ends after this. Right? Do you know how many days have passed since you called me' Butterfly'? Do you know how many days have passed since you called me' Butterfly'? I'm sensing a stomach upset. I'll be back in 10 minutes Where are you going? Bathroom... I'll be back soon... 10 minutes... Please - Sorry. Sorry - Make it fast! Brother, I can't judge my action But please trust me once I will not trouble you Who are you? Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! - I am starving. Why so late? - Sorry! A small disturbance inside Are you ok now? Everything's set now Hey Butterfly... you are the best thing to happen to me I love you Fine, I'll come Can you please come with me? This is one of such kind the day you will be nabbed Get into the jeep Sir, not just that but what I'm saying is... why do you want us to postpone the surgery from today? Do the surgery tomorrow, sir I need an hour with Arjun! Ok The other day while inquiry, didn't you ask me what the heck did I do? Here is a list of what the heck I've done Before you leave Rishi's body... I wanted you to know what the heck we have done and hence I postponed your surgery Let me tell you, how you died on that day Explain what happened Sir, on the day of accident, I was driving down... I was driving perfectly fine but he was driving recklessly I don't know what happened after that I clearly understood he is innocent. The investigation has proved it - You may leave - Thank you, sir Thank you Summon the next Arjun, about these guys Speak out! He bashed up our chief, that too in our own locality Our chief had a reputation in that locality. He was embarrassed I couldn't bare it. I decided to finish him off I love you, Arjun - No buddy - Listen, let's leave Shut up! We decided to isolate him and murder him While we were following him on Chevala road... Look! He met with an accident! We've got him. Let's finish him off nice and slow Hey look! An accident! Who are these guys? Hold on! May be muggers Hey! He's dead Good for us. Look, he died on the spot We thought he died but we saw him one day while waiting at signal - Looks like Arjun - What? Let get away at once! Drive! Fast! He came back as a ghost. We were scared that he'll kill all of us Hence, we didn't step out of the house at all Yesterday, a masked guy thrashed us. We presumed that it might be him and wanted to leave the city But you caught us before we could leave It's true that we conspired, but we didn't kill him Lock them behind the bars. - Sir... - Get lost - Raju... - Sir? - Send in the third team - Ok sir My grandpa died ten days ago After everyone left, I was boozing with my friends An accident! Call the ambulance Can you hear us, sir? - Sir! Sir! Open the door - Dude! Dude, let me break the door open. Move! Hold him Hey! He is dead Run, the ambulance is here Poor souls. We could have put them in the ambulance Shut up! Are you nuts? At least if they are alive, we could have helped them But the cops won't believe we say that They'll arrest us claiming that we were drunk and we murdered them Stay quiet They called up the ambulance in order to save you I traced them using that number Even they are innocent You guys may leave Mr. Arjun Arjun! Arjun! Every case must be handled in a sensitive way Even if you slip off a bit... You will hit the wrong road Just like yours So, never take cops for granted and presume them as imbeciles Thanks sir Sir... If I'm living still after death, it's because of Rishi He is my only friend now Madhavi made me swear that my past shouldn't haunt his present life Sir, the other day when I threatened you in the police station... it was not with the intention to make fun of you I was scared that it might make Rishi run around for this Sorry if I had hurt you You let me know the truth about my demise I owe you bigtime I thought we were murdered My mind was filled with a murderous rage But I don't want Rishi to get in trouble They got punished for their crimes Even you died because of me But what's my sentence? My dad always advice me to be careful... Now I get it why he said so, butterfly If something happens to us Our dear ones suffer the most My mistake has... cost both our lives, right? Arjun... I'm equally responsible for that accident If anything had happened to you alone in this accident... do you think I could have lived with that? You're my world I'm with you even after death That's my sole happiness Even after death... now I realize why we are here, Madhavi Who are you? Why do you look lost in thoughts? Why are you barging in? Answer me - Whom are you looking for? - Who is he? - I don't know - Who are you, dear? - Doesn't say anything - Whom are you looking for? Please, come with me Look in the mirror Arjun! How is this possible? I can see my son in the mirror Arjun Oh my dear Dear, can he see me too? Yes. He can see you through me He'll be in my body for only eight more hours The only thing he wished for, is to meet you guys before departing You can talk to him by looking into the mirror Mom... - Can you hear me, mom? - Yes dear. Tell me It's so hurting to see you like this, mom Please give me a hug, mom Arjun... Mom... I am hungry Aiyo! Wait Dear, please go to the shop and...no! You stay with him Let me check what's available... I'm acting weird Yes! idly batter Oh god! I forgot to prepare it What will he prepare at this hour? Gosh! Why did I take this? Damn! There is nothing at home to cook at this moment! I have no idea what to cook, dear Don't cry, mom " Oh my dear mother! this is what has been destined" " I will miss your fatherly love, dad" " Destiny can't be evaded" " But please forgive me for the blunders I had commit" " I acted hasty" " But now I've ebbed out" " I'm on my way to the far world" " fading good bye , oh dear mother!" " Oh my dear mother! this is what has been destined" " I will miss your fatherly love, dad" "I'm embracing you" " through their touch" " Time moves on" " Wish we could stop the time" " Here I'm with you!" " I'll be the air you breathe" " and keep you smiling.." " I wanna be born as your daughter again" " So please don't lose heart and be sad" "If I'm destined for a rebirth" Being a son to you both... is the best blessing I ever got in my life You guys never fell short in taking care of me Life is full of uncertainties I want you to keep smiling No matter where I am, I'll be looking down on you guys through someone Come here, dad Come here - I'm sorry. I'm sorry, dad - God bless you! God bless you! I want you guys to stay happy always Sorry for bothering you a lot Good bye, mom. Good bye, dad Padma... Console your yourself. Thanks Arjun Meeting my parents... has made me very happy This moment is all I need, Arjun I have no regrets The ones in love Swear to stay along through out the life But, you are here with me after death Even now... Leaving this world is a bit concern, but... If you are separated from me What will happen to me? I'm scared, Madhavi Butterfly... you're the best thing to happen to me Ok. No more of this crying I want you see you smiling I love you forever... and ever! - Good morning, Rishi. Awake? - Oh crap! Good morning - Shall we start the procedure? - Mom... what is doctor talking about? What am I doing here? - Well...that... - What happened mom? Actually what happened to me? Tell me, mom! - Rishi, come with me in and stand in front of the mirror - Ok Doctor! Looks like Arjun has left my son's body You are completely alright! Who is inside my body? What happened? Wasn't I suffering from fever? You are completely alright, honey - You are almost cured - I'm alright What are you saying, doctor? If that's the case, he might have left earlier Seeing Arjun instead of you was a huge miracle Arjun was struggling to find a way to leave your body Through you, he met his parents yesterday I guess Arjun and Madhavi would've got an fulfillment of life at that point I wanted to send off Arjun in the morning with a hug He left without giving me that chance The best part is that, after spending time with their children, one last time... Arjun and Madhavi's parents became normal Dear, why are you so dull? Even I'm completely fine now. What's wrong with you? Remember what Arjun said? We promised him to stay happy, you remember? Get up! Don't look gloomy Go for a walk. This is a huge miracle. Will someone believe if I say this happened? This is just my theory It was convincing to me Supernatural stuffs can only be found in the news A magic called human emotions cannot be proven scientifically May be in the near future, we'll have a scientific explanation to this So what I'm saying, in your thesis, try to come up with new ideas and different ideas All the best Complete your thesis and come. I'll meet you again Good luck - Thank you, doctor - Bye I'll just come Doctor, if you don't mind One last doubt Do you think Arjun will come back? It would be nice if he comes They were really a cute couple And moreover that bloody fellow owes me a hug Rascal! He didn't even bid a good bye to me Felt like giving you a hug, doctor What's your name again? Arjun! Let's go Coming Madhavi Make it fast See you, doctor Why did you address me as Madhavi now? Because I love you, Butterfly And you're the best thing to happen to me You won't understand it now You'll realize in time. Let's go Only in our two Telugu speaking states... 15,000 plus death reports are being recorded. How many of them would have got an opportunity to meet their loved one after death,like Arjun and Madhavi? Let's please take care of ourselves If not for us... At least for our beloved ones. END BEEP
