So here it is: The end of the road. My last night serving. My last night wearing this ridiculous outfit. No more standing over people as they talk, and text, and Tweet, and update their Facebook profiles, and basically completely ignore me. No more smiling like an idiot for photos with families I barely even know. Honestly, are they really going to put a picture of their waiter in their family photo album? I mean, how lame is that? No more dealing with Barb and her oh-so-delightful multiple personality disorder. - I'll clean it up, I'll clean it up. - Surprise! No more ambushes from Tommy, with his Taco Bell-flavoured "cuppies". Mmm! Love it, buddy! Love it! [Coughing] No more always bumping into... that guy. OK, I have to admit, I will miss the two Akbars. Their heated debates about Darwin, world politics, and... something relativism are always fascinating. But hey, what do you expect from the two most educated guys in the place? Whoa, I almost forgot: No more getting roped into attending another one of Simon's always-creatively-titled but-extremely-painful one-man shows. - Tommy! - Oh... Ah! So, as I venture off into the sunset, is there any one thing I can say I've learned for certain? Well, I guess it's that people can be pretty shitty sometimes. Not that I blame them. I mean, let's be honest: Most people don't have any real power in their lives. But the moment they sit down in my restaurant and I approach their table, they're the boss, they're finally in charge of someone. And let me tell you, some people take that to heart. And it only makes things worse that they assume my kindness is fake, that I'm only being nice to them because I want a big tip. And that's not true. Well, OK, maybe it's a little true, but it's not the only reason. Look, it's a server's job to be nice to people whether they like it or not. It's not like we can be honest with them, right? Anyway, none of that matters anymore because tonight I'll walk out of those doors for good. And I gotta say, I can't wait. So, here's how it's going to go down: Come closing time, all the idiots once again risk life and limb on that death trap. I'll wait to break the news to Godfrey. Now, I haven't told anybody I'm quitting, just like we talked about. I want things to be nice and clean... no casualties. Woohoo! Unlike the deathtrap. So when the moment of truth arrives, I'll be ready. - Is he OK? - [Man]: Good to go, boss! I've been waiting three years for this moment, and nothing is gonna stop me. - OK, baby. - This might sting a little. Whoa, whoa. What are you doing down there? Whoa, that hurts! Ugh! Jesus, Josh. - I was trying to give you an early birthday gift. - I know. It's just it doesn't feel like a gift when you skewer me, that's all. Maybe try a card next time? - Fine. I'm sorry. - I just thought maybe if I tried something new, you know? Things haven't exactly been working out for you... I mean us... recently. I can't believe you would bring that up. That was one time. This is not a regular- situations hip. Yes, I know. I just thought things would be better now that you're finally finished working at that damn restaurant. No, you know what? Forget it. Let's just, let's just put this behind us. Now, I want to hear how your final shift went last night. Did you end up spitting in anyone's food? Not that anybody would notice in that dump. Josh? Come on, Josh. How'd it go? - I'm sorry, what? - Oh my God, Josh. Please say you quit. - OK. "You quit." What? - That's not what you wanted? Josh, for God's sakes, just be honest with me. - Fine. I masturbate in the shower. - Josh! - What? I'm being honest. - I even do it at your apartment. Oh, my God. Jenny, come back into the apartment! No! - Jenny, come back! - Why? So I can watch you make babies with your bathtub? No thanks! - Well, that's the last time I'm honest with you, isn't it? - No. No jokes. - You were supposed to quit two weeks ago! - I'm sorry. It didn't come up. You bring it up! That's how quitting works! God! You put in your 3 years. Your dad is gonna give you the money that you need - to go to law school. Isn't that what you wanted? - I wrote my LSATs, didn't I? - Did you? I don't know! - Where are your scores? They were - supposed to be here a week ago. - I know. I'll call again. This waitering job was always just temporary, Josh. You said so yourself! - You're not allowed to set foot in there ever again! - Jenny, I can't quit like that! - You had your chance. - Last night was supposed to be your final shift, and as far as I'm concerned, it was. - Jenny, wait. - No. Josh, no. I made dinner reservations tonight at Halo Grill at eight o'clock. If you haven't quit by then, then don't bother showing up. No, Jenny... I mean, wait. I I need your keys to my apartment. You mean these keys? Yes, those. Oops. Nice. - Eight o'clock! - Shit. That's the last time, Josh! I'm sorry, Gretchen! OK, so I chickened out again. But tonight will truly be my last night, I swear. So I bid you adieu, TRUBLEEVER, my most faithful reader. It's been a pleasure serving you all these years. Keep well, and remember: Tip your waiter. ♪♪ Yeah better place your bets on this guy ♪ ♪ Create this effortless ♪ Don't just try things... This is bullshit! Come on, God, show me a spot! [Heavenly chiming] Glory, hallelujah! [Snickering] [Tires squealing] [Horn honking] [She growls] Oh, yeah. You move that piece of crap right now! - Out! - Who's talking? God, is that you? - It's me, you fucking little twit. - Holy moly. Lady, your lips don't move when you talk. That is nuts. You're like a ventriloquist of your own face! - Move the fucking car. - Sorry, no can do. You should use that handicapped space over there. The way you look, no one will say shit. - Don't mess with me. - I am warning you! I think it's a little late to be worried about people messing with you. - The damage is done, lady. - Ha ha ha ha. Fucking little shithead. Idiot. Who the fuck do you think you are? Yeah, asshole. I'm talking to you. You fucking deaf, or what? Now get the fuck out of here. You weren't built for illegal underground kickboxing! You are nailing it, mister. Yo, Simon, did I just hear you say you're nailing some guy? Yeah, your father, and he loves it. - Joke's on you. - My dad's dead. Booyah! No, I was going over lines from an audition I had this morning. I'm up for the role of Thug #6. - Pow! - Thug #6? Did they see your heads hot, brother? Lick me, Tommy. I was awesome. And I'm going to get a callback. - Gentlemen. - Hey, Josh. What's going on? What are you doing here, Joshua? I thought your lady was taking you out for your birthday tonight. Yeah, she is. Look, guys, I'm glad you're both here, because... Oh, hey, I'm glad you're here too, buddy. You guys are about to bask in the glow of my new crotch-soaking plates. Huh? Huh? "STD muffin"? - No, dude. "Stud muffin." - I don't think so. Yeah. If that's what you wanted, you should have put the U in the first word. See? Like anybody would get "muffin" from "MFN"? Come on! - They would. - They wouldn't, Simon! Yeah, they would. And why didn't you just use two U's, anyway? Bro, you're allowed eight characters. We went through this last year - with your "hug dick" plates... - "Huge dick"! They say - "huge dick"! - Relax. Nobody's judging you. You want to hug huge dicks or whatever, you go right ahead. But I think you ought to let - those dudes know about your STD, OK, muffin? - Yeah, Tommy. It's only fair. Fuck you guys. Well, that's... Well, this is pretty last-minute. Well, how bad is it? Well, I mean, just on a scale of one to 10, how bad is your diarrhoea? Ten. All right, well, you know what? It was an inverted scale, so that means you're fine! So get down here right... Well, I... OK, OK, OK. But would you consider wearing Depends? How is that degrading? Astronauts wear them! Oh, so what? So you're better than an astronaut? Is that... [Knocking at door] - All right, OK, fine. Bye. - Godfrey? You got a second? - Josh, I'm so glad to see you. You didn't have any of those chicken wings last night, did you? No, I don't like chicken wings. Well, that's crazy, but I'm glad to hear it. - Look... - Yeah, I told them to throw those things out eons ago, but nobody listens to me. And now I've got half my staff out with their asses gushing shit like an out-of-control fire hose. - That's really graphic. I didn't need to know that. - I know you aren't scheduled to work tonight, but could you do me a solid? Huh? Come on. You can be first off. And, and I'll throw in the meal. What do you say? You know? Anything. I mean, obviously not the lobster. You know, or the steak. You know, I'm thinking, like a hamburger. You know, - chicken strips. A potato. - Godfrey, I. [Phone ringing] Yeah, hold that thought. Hello, Ranch Steakhouse. Big city place, big country taste. How are... What the fuck? No, that's not OK! No, you can't just... You have to give someone some advanced warning on this! No, I... It's not acceptable! I won't stand for it! Huh? Fine. All right, that's a good point. Josh... the Germans are coming. - That's never good. - No. It's always terrible. Yeah. The German company that bought the restaurant, they're... they're... they're sending someone over from head office to audit us. To audit us! I need to ace this audit. - Godfrey, honestly... - You know, and you're my ace waiter. I can't ace this audit without my ace waiter. I need you to help me ace. Look, I'm not going to beg, but please. Please, please. - Please. Please, please, please, please. - That's pretty much begging. - No, it's just really intense asking. - Mm, but they're similar. - Please. Please do this for me. - I have a baby on the way. - Another one? Really? - I know. I know! And my in-laws are Asian. They are so judgmental, Josh. You're fucking working? Just until the end of the dinner rush. I'll be off by eight o'clock, guaranteed. No. No, just walk away right now! Jenny, I can't leave my friends in the lurch. - I have to do this. Then I'm out the door forever, I promise. - Eight o'clock, Josh. - Not a second later! - Halo Grill is two blocks from here. I'll be there as soon as I can. Eight o'clock, eight o'clock, eight o'clock! Aww! How is that even possible?! ♪♪♪ [Kitschy music] - Ugh, Jesus! What died in here? - Ha ha! You like that, huh? Say goodbye to the last of those chicken wings. Ba-kaw! - How are you even standing? - Guts of steel, brother. I could swallow the Ebola virus and not get sick. Nice outfit, by the way. - Oh, shut up. - I couldn't say no. Yeah, God forbid you actually have to spend time with your girlfriend. I don't know where you're going with this, but I'm really not in the mood for one of your lectures, OK Tommy? - OK, all right, say no more. - You're the boss. Oh! What are you doing? Don't touch me in the bathroom, Tommy! - It's weird! - Yeah. Get in there. Think you can just shut me up, just like that? Don't you know me? I told you: I don't want to hear it! I'm dealing with enough shit today! Yep. Well, you're going to have to deal with a little more. Look behind you. That's a sweet corn torpedo, my friend. God, Tommy, what is your problem? You! You are my problem! You think you and Jenny are this great couple? Think again! When was the last time you said anything nice about her, huh? - Wha... - When you first started working here, you used to rattle on about Jenny: "Oh, Jenny this, Jenny that." We all thought you were a fucking pole smoker, dude! - Just open the door! - And another thing: - You avoid seeing her. - What? No I don't! - Yes you do. Just the other day, I caught you lying to Jenny on the phone about having to work late when you were actually watching goddamn TV! It was the playoffs! - Please, man! - It was the WNBA finals. Oh, yeah. Well, so what? I mean, what does any of this prove, anyway? It proves that you've got to stop being such a goddamn chickenshit and ride... the... bull! - You and that bull, Tommy! - Enough! No! Trust me, man. I know what I'm talking about, all right? One ride on that baby, and you will finally have the man-balls to dump that miserable whore and accept who you really are. Face it: You're one of us now. There. I said what I had to say. Come to Papa. Just looking out for you, dude. - Well, don't. - Nobody asked you to. And besides, I don't need to be thrown off some poorly constructed mechanical deathtrap to know that I've got my priorities completely messed up. - What? You think I actually want to be a waiter? - Yeah, I do. You love this job. You're crazy. And your breath smells like a homeless man's dick. That's the last time I give your dad a blow job. Boom! Tommy one, Josh... Oh, shit! It does stink. Aw, no cups again? Son of a bitch! Oof! Ow! Ha ha ha! Booyah, biatch! And here we have our famous wall of wagon wheels. And, oh, something I think you'll find interesting: This is an actual yoke from an oxcart from a... Howdy, partners. And right over here, we have a lot of museum-quality exhibits... - He speaks with a scary accent. - I know. No, Owen, boo-boo. You can't make movies in the bathroom. That's the babysitter's private time. No, baby, you can't put it on the internet, OK? Listen up: I wuv you. Bye. Ugh. Lucky fucking me. Not only do I get called in on my day off, but I have to work - with you whiny little bitches. - Wow. Nice, Barb. Why don't you save some of that tough talk for your kids, huh? Please, asshole, do not tell me how to raise my children. And if you come near me with one of those fart-fist fucking things, - I will cut your dick off. - It's called a cuppy. Is it? Move, sister. Oh, hairy tainted balls. Look at this. This is it? This is going to be a total shit show! Who is hosting? Oh, Jesus, no. - Hi, y'all! - [All]: Hi, Chrissy. OMG.

Uh, Chrissy, why is the name "Alex" written next to mine? Hello! PSA: Green grease pencil means trainee. He starts at 6:30. What? No, I can't train someone. I've got to be out of here as soon as possible. Oh, hey, no. Don't look at me. Until that lawsuit's settled, I can't train anyone. Relax. I'll take him. I like having first dibs on new meat, anyway. Rawr. What does it matter who takes him? No one's getting out of here anytime soon. And who is the freak with the man-purse? Oh, yeah, it's one of our new German commandants. What do you think he's saying to Godfrey? "And zis is where ve vill put ze firing squad. And over here, ze gas chamber. And over here, I'm sinking of putting a nice garden." Franz, can I introduce you to these happy campers here? This is our serving staff. Everyone, a big welcome for Franz. Franz, maybe I could have a moment with the staff here. And perhaps you'd like to inspect our kitchen. Yes. I am very interested in your ovens. - [Barb]: Are you? - Come on. Shut up! I know. Shut up. Come on, guys. I need you to help me out here, all right? I know no one is happy about Heindschlap Industries taking over the company, you know? Especially in light of the recent scandal. Tonight is a big night. We can't have any mistakes. No big mistakes. And I am not singling Tommy out. Now, we all know what happened when they audited the King Street location, right? And could that happen here? Yeah, that could happen here. Is it gonna happen here? No, it is not gonna happen here. You know why? Because we are Ranchers, and I know that if we work together as a team, there is nothing this night can throw at us that we can't handle. Am I right? Huh? 'Cause if not, then I... I'm going to take one of those rifles down off the wall, and I'm going to just Kurt Cobain it, right here in the middle of the dining room. And I will just end it right here, just boom! Blam! And I'll get your attention first so you're looking. And you will live with that image for the rest of your lives. And you know how much I'm joking? This much! Just this much! Don't make me joke less than that. I mean, when these touch, it's not joking anymore. All right? So who's with me tonight? Who's on my side? Who's a Rancher? - Who's a Rancher tonight? - Yes! Yes, Godfrey! - Yeah, OK. - That's fine. - Giddy up. Ah, that was inspiring. I'm... so filled with confidence now. Godfrey, come see this. Ah. Yes, Franz? - What do you see? - Uh...

The minced steak, is that sirloin chopped down or is that roast beef chopped down? Because there's a big difference, you know. - Yes. - Yeah. Is it? OK, so... And does it have gravy? - Does it have gravy? - Yeah, of course, it has gravy. - OK. They make the gravy here, do they? - It's here now. Still! Vas is that? - Oh, it's apple juice.

That is a lovely compliment. - Thank you for bringing that to my attention. - Uh-huh. - You keep up the good work. - Yes, sir. Bye. You really saved my ass. Get me a goddamn martini, right now. Right away. And put a straw in it. - Sorry about that, Franz. - Just a satisfied customer wanting to express her satisfaction with the - service. - Godfrey, may I speak to you in the office, please? Of course, Franz. Of course. - Stop it. - It's my drawing! Let go! So that's three chuck wagon chicken fingers, three prairie dogs, and two highfalutin' prime ribs. Uh-oh. I made a spill. Oh, uh-oh. I made a spill too. Those cups are horrible for children. - Look how easily they tip over! - I know. I'm sorry. - Kids, why don't you go and wash up? And when you come back, the waiter is going to take you - to ride on the bull. - [Kids]: Yay! Yeah, the bull's actually for birthday boys and girls only, so... - Yeah. It's their birthday... - All of them. - Hmm? - And we want cake. And singing. And another drink. [Slow clapping] What is the little one's name again? - Very good. - That was well handled. - Sorry, gentlemen. I didn't see you there. - Ah. No worries, Deputy Josh. It's exciting for us to see such an important lawman dispensing his own brand of justice. And by "justice", I mean fries. - [Guys laughing] - Uh, have we met? - Oh, I don't think so. Well, we clearly run in different circles. I'm what you cowpokes would call a "city slicker". - [Guys laughing] - Waiter? Waiter! Hurry! The table is soaked! Josh? Josh? We just have a few more questions about the menu. Bring us a bottle of your best champagne when you return. See, tonight is a celebration. I just landed a plum residency at St. Jude's. Gynecology. That's right: I'm going to be elbow-deep in 'Gina all day and getting paid for it. - Boom. - Pssh! ♪♪♪ That is Belvedere vodka, ma'am... one of our finest vodkas available. Toots, I know Belvedere, and that is not Belvedere. I saw the bartender pour it myself, ma'am. - Hm. I'll get you another. - And hurry up. So, Deputy Josh. Do you have yourself a cowgirl, or are you just a lone ranger? [Guys laughing] Yes, I've got a lady. We've been together for four years. Four years. Huh. That's about the same length of time it takes for someone to go to medical school, isn't it? Oh, I got it. It's Chaz, right? Chase. But feel free to call me Dr. Van Haver. Yeah, you're Jenny's ex. - Jenny, Jenny, Jenny, Jenny... - Oh! Yes, Jenny Brooks. Sure, I remember her. Well, actually, of course I do. I mean, we had dinner together just last Tuesday. [Camera clicks] Nice. Oh, you didn't know. Well, don't worry. We were just catching up on old times. By the way she was talking, I pegged you for a real loser. But now that we've met, I can see that, well, she was being a little harsh. Not only are you a nice guy, but I can tell you are one hell of a waiter. - Do you know what you want? - Yeah. Yeah, I want you out of the picture. I'm back in town. I'm looking to pick up where I left off. So why don't you do the right thing and ride your loser ass off into the sunset? - [Cork popping] - Ow! [Guys laughing] Thank you, Deputy Josh. Out with the old, in with the new, huh, Franz? Well, I guess you won't be needing this anymore. [Fizzling out] That was disappointing. We've really got to stop watering the booze. Godfrey! Godfrey, I need - to talk to you, right now! - Occupied... - Like Poland. - Godfrey, I'm not kidding. - This is important. - Don't care! I'm busy. - Go away. - No! I'm not leaving! Not until you talk to me. - Mm-hmm. - Wait, no, I am leaving! That's what I came to tell you. I'm leaving, and I'm not coming back. You hear me? [Electricity zapping] Hey... Hey! Godfrey? Godfrey? Are you OK? Aw, come on! [Talking at once] - What's going on? - I have got orders to put in! He's rebooting the system. It'll be up in a minute. Just give him some space. - What's the problem? - This is unacceptable. I hear you, Franz. But you bought a company with 10-year-old computer systems. - Stuff like this happens. - What are you talking about, moron? We just... Hey, Barb! Why don't you stop talking for a minute and take Franz here into the dining room? I'm sure we have guests who could use a reassuring word from someone with your obvious people skills, huh? Franz, why don't you come with me? We'll put out some fires, buddy. What? There's a fire? So here's the lowdown: Uh, what are you doing here? I don't want to miss this. OK. Guys, Alex. Alex, Guys. - Hi. - Yeah. How's it going? - OK. The door's locked, he's lying on the ground, and there's a bottle in his hand. - Oh, God. Is he alive? - Well, I think he's breathing, but damn it, I'm a server, not a physician! - Should I call an ambulance? - No, no, no. If we do that, Franz will fire his ass. We just need to find a way to discreetly get in there, check on him, and get the system up and running again. - OK. But how? - The skylight. We can come in through the skylight. Remember when those kids broke in last year and took a dump on every table? That's how they got in. - I thought you were the one... - There's no proof. Guys, task at hand. We can't get in through the skylight without a rope. Actually... [All]: Hmm. ♪♪♪ OK, for the record, drawing straws is bullshit. Hurry up! Dude, don't rush us, all right? These lights are more tangled than an Asian girl's bush! - Tommy, not in front of the lady! - No, it's OK. Strangely enough, - I was thinking the same thing. - Whoops! - Oh, God! Hold up! - Oh, this ain't right. Oof. Just a sec. I got it! - Seriously?! - Yep, they work! Guys... Hey. Is that you, Jesus? You know what? You know, you look a lot like this guy that works for me... Except, of course, he's Jewish. It is me, Godfrey. And Jesus was Jewish too, so you know. That's funny, Jesus. All right. He's not dead, although I might be if any more blood rushes to my head. OK, I almost have it. - Whoa! Whoa! - Oh, shit! [Retching and coughing] - Ew! Oh, God! Oh, God, that's gross! - Ugh! [Tommy]: Dude, lay off the guacamole! The sucker is fried. Ugh, I still have the image in my head. Stop being such babies and get down here. Godfrey. Godfrey, wake up. - How are you feeling? - Uh... Ugh. Did I puke? Uh, yeah, you did. Oh, yeah, I can still taste it. OK, Godfrey, what's going on with you? Josh, do you know what 20 years of dedicated service to Ranch Steakhouse gets you? - Do you? - Is it the horseshoes? - No, it's a kick in the balls. - You want to see? - Your balls? Not particularly. - No, Josh! Not my balls. No, this. Read that. Read it. Go on. Read. [Sighing] You know what? I wanted to own my own restaurant, you know? I did, I did. I had all these big plans, you know? This job was just supposed to be temporary. But I got I got stuck. You know how I got stuck? It's all 'cause, you know what? First comes love, then comes marriage, then comes one horny night when you screw up all your dreams by convincing your wife that pulling out is an effective means of birth control. Idiot. Don't get stuck, Josh. Don't you get stuck. No, you, you live the dream, Josh. You live the dream. Oh, that was close. - Yeah, really. - That was close. - What... No. Godfrey? - Godfrey, wake up. You have to get back out into the restaurant. ♪♪♪ Good idea. I wouldn't want to be here for this either. ♪♪♪ - Where have you been?! - OK, I quit. I'm done. - Congratulations. - Your new life starts tonight. Hey, this is kind of like a Romeo & Juliet-type thing. - Ugh, I hate that movie. - Come on, get up here. Hey, uh, random question, but do you remember what you did last Tuesday night? Tuesday? No, I don't remember. Why? What does it matter? Let's just enjoy the night. It matters because I happened to run into. - [All]: Surprise! - What is this? - Happy birthday, Jim. - Happy birthday, Jim. - Happy birthday! - Blow them out. But it says... OK. - [Cheering] - Come on. Who the hell are all these people? - They're our friends, Josh. - People I work with. You've met them before. Anyway, you'll be seeing a lot more of them now that you're not working nights. - Guess who. - Pop? Happy birthday. Can you believe it? My boy is 25! Well, not until midnight, officially. Which is also officially the end of Josh's three years - of working. - I remember, Jenny, of course. If Josh still wants to be a lawyer, I'm willing to pay for everything now. Ah! Oh, my God, the day is finally here! Sam, thank you so much. Josh can't wait to go back - to school. Can you, Jo shy? - Well, he was always a great student, especially in English. He loved creative writing. - Do you still write at all, son? - Oh, he's been writing this blog about the restaurant, but that's all over and done with now, thank God. - You knew about my blog? - Are you I saw it on your computer, but I never read it. It's not like it was paying the bills, right? - Mmm, no. - Sorry to interrupt, Jim. Jenny, is there any food coming out, or...? They haven't come around with more trays yet?! God, these waiters have been dragging their asses all night! Whoa, let's not jump to conclusions. It's busy, and I don't see a lot of them on the floor. Besides, could be the kitchen is backed up. - You never know, Jen. You've just got to give people a break. - OK, OK. Relax. - You quit. Enough. - Well, what is that supposed to mean? It means I'm sick of you fighting for the rights of every pathetic schlub who pours you a coffee. You're not one of them anymore; You're one of us now. Hey why don't you open the present? Uh, I'm going to wash up and cool off. I'll open it when I get back. - Jim? Who the fuck is Jim? - So, what did you get him? It's... for him. Face it: You're one of us now. You're not one of them anymore; You're one of us now. I am very interested in your ovens. What? - Where's Joshua? - Have you seen him? Not since the office, brother. I've been taking some of his tables. Man, are they shit! - Ugh, this night is pure hell. - Achtung! Uh, listen up, listen up. Um, in case you do not know, Godfrey is in violation of Heindschlap Industries' policy. He is fired. - What? - And unless you want the same fate, you will do as I say. I am in charge now. Now, we have many hungry guests, and you will serve them in an efficient manner. Follow my orders, and you will be successful! Now, everyone, get back to work! Schnell! Schnell! - Beat it! Get in there! - No! Everyone stay right where you are! This meeting's not over. You! You are the one that lied to me. You are fired too. Go home. Just shut your Von Trapp, Franz. I've heard enough yelling out of you for a lifetime. Tommy, can you? Please? - What are you doing? - Let go of me! Look, before you all rush off to do your jobs with unfaltering dedication, I think you deserve to know something: We're all about to get fired! - What?! - That's not true. In two weeks, our new German owners are shutting us down for renovations. And when they reopen, we all have to re-interview for our jobs. - Fucking Germans! - I just saw it all laid out in a memo from head office. Even Godfrey has to re-interview. That's why he's gone all crazy. - What? - Fucking Germans! - This is standard procedure. If you are good at your jobs, there's nothing to worry about! Nothing, nichts! Relax! OK, Franz, see, that's what all these guys are worried about. Hey, Oldy-locks. If I were you, I'd be worried most of all. They're not just looking for fresh paint; They're looking for fresh faces, which means your geriatric ass will be the first to go! - [Franz]: Not necessarily. - Well, what do you want us to do, Josh? Just walk out? I mean, we can't do that! That's a sure way to guarantee we all get fired! - Yeah! - We're all getting fired anyway! The only question is do we go out as chumps, - or do we go out with a little dignity? - What are you thinking, Joshua? I'll tell you what I'm thinking. I'm thinking tonight is our night. - [Franz]: Nein, not tonight. - Tonight is a bad night. For one night, let's not put up with the usual customer bullshit. For one night, let's dish out - what we get dished! - Nein, nein, nein, nein! I will not let you ruin the name of Heindschlap Industries! I will stop it! Ruin the good name of Heindschlap? Please, I'm pretty sure that went out the out the window when those kids in Michigan were born with two heads. - Michigan? - That was not our fault. Well, that's up for the jury to decide. In the meantime, Tommy, can you lock this sour Kraut in the liquor room? I have Heindschlap Industries behind me! Be careful! Jesus! [Grunting with effort] Ah! Get in there! Yeah! - Are you OK? - Feisty little fucker. All right, people. We're servers, not servants. And we're staring into a wide-open window of opportunity here. We're not going to be given a chance like this again. So I say, for the rest of the night, don't take any more... [Spraying] Akbar? Akbar. Could you give us a second, dudes? As I was saying, for the rest of the night, don't take any more crap! No fake smiles, no tucking our tails between our legs.

Well, um, I could do with being a little less bipolar, and having better hair. But no, there's nothing wrong with what Barb does for a living. Did you know that in some countries, being a server is a highly distinguished position? Well, I hate to break it to you, Alex, but in good old North America, being a waiter is equated with being a flat-out failure. Huh. Um... Wow, you really have a way with words. [Shouting from within] I'm a bad boy! [Sobbing] Ah! I like that! Blood. Sweet blood. Oh! That's good! Yaaah! I'm a bad boy! [Shouting] You dirty bad boy! Swine, you swine, you dirty swine! Dirty swine! [Yelling] ♪♪♪ [Rock music] Does that seem odd? Uh... What are you doing here? How dare you! Do you know how hard I worked to plan that party? How could you just walk out like that? Now, Jenny, I'm sure he has a good reason. You do, son, right? Uh... I thought I did. That's it? That's your excuse? "I thought I did"?! Oh, my God. All I can say is it's a good thing that you're through with this place, because it's made you into a total selfish jerk! Speaking of selfish jerks, I got a chance to finally meet Chase this evening. That's her ex. Nice guy. Stopped in here tonight to burn a pentagram on my skull. Oh, and tell me that he went on a date with Jenny last week. Ugh. It wasn't a date; It was dinner! And the only reason I even went... Besides the fact that he's actually free at night... was because I wanted him to see - how good I was doing. I wanted to brag about you. - Maybe I just don't understand the definition of the word "brag", because according to him - you said I was a loser. - I never said you were a loser. I just told him the truth: That you were nearly 25, didn't own a thing, and you worked as a waiter. Can I help it if he got "loser" from that? Well... you could have at least told him I'm funny. Sorry, it escaped my mind. If I see him again, I'll tell him. - [Door opening] - Where's Josh Stein? You! - Chase? - What are you doing here? - What are you doing here? - Well, there he is. - Tell him I'm funny now. Oof! - Oh, my God! - Nice manoeuvre, you little shit! Get up! - Hey! You leave my son alone! - I'm going to kick your ass. I don't think so, striped-shirt. - Uh-oh. Another deputy. - Whatever should I do? You should shut your fucking mouth, bitch! That's what you should do! - You. - Hi there. - Oh, my God. Oh, no. You've got your daddy and a bunch of minimum-wage morons protecting you. I'm shaking in my boots. Well, guys, congratulations. You're all stuck in nothing jobs, living nothing lives, amounting to absolutely nothing. - Yeah, you're right! - Now I'm going to pound your face into nothing, so maybe we'll have something in common, huh? - Screw you. - Screw me? Yaaaaai... - Hey, hey, hey, hey! What the hell is going on? Can't I lapse into a brief coma without everything falling apart? - Are you the manager? - That's debatable - at this point, but let's just go with yes. - I don't know where you have been all night, dick face, but you should know that your staff is completely off the deep end. Not only have they been humiliating your customers every chance that they get, but they physically assaulted me. In fact, you know what? I'm about to call the cops. - Oh, don't... Come on... - Who would assault you? - Barb? - No! - No, he did. I think. But they were all involved. Even... twinkle-toes here. - Did you just say, "I think"? - Well, I didn't see who did it, numb nuts. They ambushed me. All right. Well, you've got witnesses for this ambush? - Witnesses? - Yeah. What, you think I did this to myself? - Maybe, I don't know. - I did this to myself. - That's true, he did. - Yeah. So there. You're going to believe these dip shits over me. Well, yeah. You see, actually, I really like these people, and you I'm finding unusually unpleasant. So, yes, you call your police, and you talk to them, and it'll be your word against ours. - Fine. - OK. Have your one victory in life. Enjoy it, 'cause it won't last. You picked a real winner here, Jenny. I hope the two of you are very happy together. - Woof! - Out of my way! - OK, Josh. Let's go. - Yeah. Off you go, Josh. - You have a great birthday. We'll see you in a few days. Aha. - You still haven't quit? - What the hell is the matter with you? - Quit? Why would he quit? Because, as crazy as this sounds, Josh doesn't want to be a waiter anymore. No, he's done - stuffing your heart-clogging food down people's throats. - We do salads. - That's not the point. - Well, I just think people have a choice. No, it's time for Josh to grow up and do something real with his life, not live in this prolonged adolescence that you call a job. - Let me at her! Fucking... - Whoa, whoa! Come on! - OK. - All right, point taken. Well, I guess you should be on your way, Josh. But on behalf of everyone here, I just want to say it has been a pleasure. - All right, good enough. - Come on, Josh. Let's go. Josh, come on! Now! ♪♪♪ Here. What's this? Your LSATS! - You didn't tell me they came in. - I guess I've changed my mind. I'm not going to law school... Not now, not ever. What? - I want to be a writer. - It's all I've ever wanted. I just didn't have the guts to give it a shot until tonight. So you can keep those scores. I don't need them. - But how are you going to make money? - Well, I'll I'll keep waiting tables. Yeah! Uh, uh, uh, uh! I'm good at it. And... I think I even kind of like it. I don't want to be with someone who serves people anymore. No, I want to be with someone who gets served, someone important, someone they throw big black-tie parties for. Waiters don't get to go to big black-tie parties, Josh. Well, actually, they do, but through a separate entrance. - Ha! Oh, snap! - She means us, asshole. Goodbye, Josh. Good luck. You're an idiot! - [Godfrey]: OK, everybody. - Show's over. - Why don't we all get back to work? Here you go, Sam. - Thank you. Oh, Josh, I gotta tell you, I really think you blew it with that one.

Alex, I gotta tell you, that was so satisfying to train you. - I want to thank you so much. - Really? No, you really sucked ass, OK? You took years off my life. Here's a dime. This is the best night I've had in years. - Oh, my God, me too. - Ménage à trois, boys! Ha! Weird. So how'd you do, Simon? Super-duper, same as always. - What? You always make this much money? - Yep. I don't need a special night to speak my mind. Gay guys get away with saying bitchy shit to people all the time. They just eat it up. - Balls. Wish I was a gay man. - You're not? - Tommy! - [Cell phone ringing] Hi. Put him on! Owen, if you and your brother don't go the fuck to bed right now, Mommy is coming home and going to spank you like it's 1950, you got me?! I love you! - [Tommy laughing] - Yeah you did. - Dude, you took some really big steps today, brother. - Thank you. Yeah. There's only one thing left for you to do. Really?

Close the door. Close the door! Close the door! Close it. [Tommy]: Fucking Germans... - You are my brother. - You are good. - I love you, Franz. - Yes, I love you too. - OK. - Goodbye, Godfrey. [Godfrey]: All right. Well, your jobs are all safe. That is, of course, assuming you still want to work here. - Where else would we go? - Well, you know, I have an idea, inspired by these customer comment cards that normally contain nothing but drawings of boners but tonight have customer comments in them. And, of course, a few boners. But it would seem that the people loved what they saw and heard here tonight. - Really? - Yeah! They did, they loved it. All the insults, the abuse, the neglect, the shenanigans... They seemed to think it was some kind of theatre. So I say fuck Heindschlap Industries. There's no way I'm letting those child-mutating bastards in on this. This is a great concept for a new restaurant. For our new restaurant! - Ours? - Yes, ours! - So, what do you say? Should we open our own restaurant? - [All]: Yeah! Open our own restaurant? If you guys aren't into it, that's fine. Oh, never mind. All right, you talked me into it. Let's do it.
