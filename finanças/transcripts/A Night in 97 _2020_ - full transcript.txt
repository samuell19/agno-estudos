Straight into the lounge, get the door. Adam Roberts. This has gone far enough. We've still got time. We can call the police. And say what exactly? Hello, we killed someone, brought them back to my house and now decided it was maybe a good time to let you know. We can say he was alive. We brought him into keep him warm so we could use the phone, and then he died while we were waiting. Don't play dumb, Simon. You know as well as I do the second the police arrive, no matter what the circumstances, tomorrow morning, polling day, yes, our faces are on the front page of every newspaper in the country accompanied by very, very, very bad headlines. Come on, forget what that means for our careers, our lives, your family's lives. What about the party? All the other candidates facing election tomorrow. All the people that need our party. We can't let one accident jeopardize everything. You think I don't know that? You think I don't realize that. There's a phone right there. If you genuinely, and I mean, genuinely believe the best thing to do is call the police and tell them what happened, then do it. Hello, Bertie Oldcross. Yes, Ms. Robinson, I do apologize. Simon had a slight red wine accident and needed a fresh shirt. The party, they're wondering where we are. Nowhere. Make something up. We cannot go to that party. I know, Mrs. Robinson, I'm looking forward to celebrating with you too. What would it look like if we don't? We go for an hour, keep everything settled, and then sort this when we get back. No Bertie, no. Here he is now, Mrs. Robinson, all sorted. We will be with you in 10. This is all gonna end badly, Bertie. We've got to go. 40 minutes, then we'll say we need an early night and slip off. Give him a moment. Shall we? Oh. Please, you're very kind, but there's no need to pretend you're here for me. I know you've really come for the free booze. Speaking of which, who was gonna show me to the bar? Ah. Mr. Adeveret? Oh, Mrs. Robinson. Did I startle you there. Just a bit, yeah. Sorry, I am sorry. Good final numbers we had, right. Fantastic, yeah, thank you for all your help during the campaign. Yeah, help's been superb. Oh, anything for Bertie and the party. You know that, Mr. Adeveret. And how's the family, all okay? All good, thank you. They must be so very proud of what you're trying to do. You think Bertie will say a few words tonight? Oh, I shouldn't think so, Mrs. Robinson, it's been a very long campaign. Oh, sorry, Mr. Adeveret, I almost forgot. Someone actually rang here just before you arrived. They said they tried your house, but you'd already left the party. That's the number, they said you should give them a call back as soon as you had a moment. Who is this? Oh, yes, it's the head of this. Right, well, I better get on and do this then. Labour head office, Jonathan speaking. Oh, hello, Jonathan, it's Simon here, Bertie Oldcross campaign manager, Scarborough and Whitby. Ah, glad we've tracked you down. You're at the Whitby Social Center? Yeah, at the end of campaign party, with the volunteers. Okay, and Bertie's there? He is, yep. Right, I'm letting you know, Simon, we got wind of the unfortunate incident earlier this evening and for the good of the party, we have alerted police. They'll be there soon. Obviously we'll spin the story as best we can, but it's not going to be the best of times for you and Bertie. You understand that it's crucial we protect the party from incidents like this, especially the day before general election. Hello, Laura speaking, Labour Party, head office. Hello, it's Simon, Bertie Oldcross's campaign manager, Scarborough and Whitby Ah, fantastic, thanks for calling back. Looks like it's going to be a great day for you tomorrow. Very promising numbers. Yes, yes, we're all very excited. We've had great numbers across the country in our final polls. So if that's reflected in the result tomorrow night, it'll be a special moment for everyone. Fantastic. Yeah, that's fantastic. So the leadership has started to identify potential options for government positions. Just getting a sense of what our administration could look like if things do go away. Right. And based on Bertie's stance on crime and justice throughout the campaign, something that's really caught the public's attention, we believe he would be an ideal option to fill the minister of state for prisons position. Prisons, the minister for prisons? Now, obviously this is all preliminary and dependent on the final results tomorrow, but it's something worth discussing with Bertie, as things will start to move quickly as the picture becomes more clear after voting. Minister of state for prisons. Yes, so I'll leave that with you. Yes. Yes, thanks for letting me know. And finally I have to ask, is there anything you need to let us know about going into tomorrow, anything we need to be aware of? No, nothing I can think of. Okay, I'll let you get back to your party then. Best of luck tomorrow. Thank you so much. Everyone, everyone... I'd just like to say thanks to you all and what an absolute pleasure it's been getting to know you all throughout the campaign over the last few weeks. And I'm sure all our hard work will be worth it when Bertie Oldcross is elected tomorrow to represent Scarborough and Whitby. Now, I'm sure the man himself has a few words of his own. Now I won't say much, I promise, but now I'm sure you've all had enough of my voice by now. Obviously I want to thank you all for your support and the time you have given to my campaign. Trust me, we couldn't have done it without you. And I just want to say that if the result goes my way tomorrow, I will spend every day making sure our country is a happier, more prosperous, safer place to live. Now it's been a long campaign. Simon and I have a very big day tomorrow, so we're going to call it a night. But by all means you stay and enjoy yourselves. You've earned it. Thank you so much. Thank you, thank you so much. See you next time. Simon, Simon. How'd you do that? Do what? Put on that show. You would tell those lies. What do you mean, they weren't lies. There was a man lying dead on your sofa. What is wrong with you? Would you pull yourself together? We could go a prison, Bertie. Yeah, if I don't act as I normally would, then you are right, that is exactly what will happen. You know, yours is the first door they will knock on if I'm caught. We're in this together, Simon. Just get in. Thoughts? I've got saws in the garage. For what exactly? You know. That's disgusting. No, we just need to move the thing as is. We could throw it in the sea. No, it'll be washed up on the beach by morning. We didn't get noticed throwing it in the water. No, I need to find somewhere to bury it so it'll stay there, somewhere just to get us past tomorrow. After the elections, we're slightly in the clear. Right. We're gonna need some shovels. Right. Hello, Sarah, sweetie, it's just me leaving you a message just to say I'm back at Bertie's. A few more points we need to cover for tomorrow, so I'll be a few more hours. So don't wait up. Okay, bye. I love you. This was your perfect spot? It's plenty of land. It's nice and secluded and it's all we've got. Shall we? Enough? I really do hope so. Just hurry up and drag him there so we can leave all this behind. Just calm down. Tomorrow, everything will be back to normal. Normal? We are stuck in a damn wood in the middle of the night. Tomorrow or any other day for that matter will not be normal. Will you keep your voice down? That was the point of doing all this, no? Restoring normality to make sure we can get on with doing what we set out to do. I am doing this with the good of the people, to make this country a better place for them. That is what I care about. Trust me, it's very clear what you care about. I just hope after this, I can trust you Simon. I've got more at stake than you. Oh, well golly for you. I don't have to listen to this. Listen, Simon, I'm sorry for snapping like that... Hey Bertie Oldcross, man of the people. I never forget a face. Well, well, we are in some trouble, aren't we Bertie? You socialist scum. Just can't help yourselves, can you? Let me explain I'll do the talking, Oldcross. Me and you were gonna take a little walk up to the house and we'll see what the police make of all this. The saddest thing of all is you genuinely thought you'd get away with this, didn't you? This is all your fault. Just look at this mess. You made me do this. That is definitely not the answer, Simon, come on. Who cares? Who cares what the answer is to any of this? He fired twice. There's no shots left in the thing. Just look at this mess. It's all gone wrong. Just what have we done? Two guys die tonight because of us, because of the choices we made. We can't do anything to change that now. But if we achieve, if we genuinely deliver, surely that makes up for our actions tonight. Surely. Just get the shovel. I know it doesn't seem like it now but, I'm certain we made the right choices tonight. I don't know we had much choice in any of this, Bertie. You know, they actually offered you minister for prisons. Yeah. Party head office rang, jobs basically on the table. That's what I mean though, Simon. This is a real opportunity. You know what I'm thinking Bertie. I'm thinking what's best for my family. You know what my answer is? Get the election outta the way, get the all clear on that front and we'll reduce the impact a bit. Then I'm gonna go to the police and tell them everything. Reckon I can get around killing the farmer on self defense. He had a gun, I had a shovel, right? I'm looking at perverting the course of justice. Probably get away with no prison time, coming clean, handing them you. That's what I'm thinking, Bertie. That is what I am thinking. You know, here's what I'm thinking. I'm sure I can handle myself for one day. So you do your thinking and choose very carefully what your future is going to be. If you want to build something great together, I'll see you tonight at the gala. If you choose not to come, then our guess I'll know you've chosen your plan, and I'll expect to get a knock at my door that brings everything we've worked for, everything we've wanted crashing down. Rough night's sleep, Mr. Oldcross? It's a big day. May I come in. Please. To your right. What can I help you with then, officer? Well, Mr. Oldcross, I'm here in relation to an incident that occurred last night that we have reason to believe you may have had some involvement in. Would you like tea, officer, hot coffee, maybe? This is incredibly serious. Mr. Oldcross. It would be best if you cooperated with my inquiries. Look, I'm not sure where you got this information from, but I have a clue what you are talking about. All right, now I've got an incredibly busy day and I'd appreciate if you didn't waste any more of my time. Mr. Oldcross, I'm going to make this very clear to you. I'm here because we can place you at the scene of a double murder that took place last night. Now I'll say it for a final time, I strongly suggest you cooperate. Okay. Where do we go from here? I'll need you to come with me, Mr. Oldcross. Shall we, Mr. Oldcross? This isn't right, Bertie. This is all gonna end badly, Bertie. There's a man lying dead on your sofa. What's wrong with you? Mr. Oldcross, did you kill these two men last night? No, no, please, I can explain. That's him, all right. Socialist scum. Please, please, please. It's for the best, Bertie. No, please. For the good of the people, right, Bertie? Rough night sleep. Mr. Oldcross? It's a big day. May I come in? Please. To the right. I'm Officer Carrie. Would you like to take a seat? Of course, sorry. Did you cut yourself? Oh, I get nose bleeds, you know, I do apologize. Right, that's unfortunate. Sorry, it's been a long few weeks. What can I do for you? Mr. Oldcross. Please, Bertie is fine. I'm your chaperone for the day? Chaperone? Mr. Oldcross, Bertie, I'll be chaperoning you to cast your vote. And later tonight I'll take you to the count. I thought you were informed. Yes, yes, it must've slipped my mind. I'll need to change before we head off. Great, no problem at all. I was told your campaign manager, Simon, who will be joining us Is he on his way here or? He's having the day for himself. Makes sense. Yes. So give me half an hour to change and we can head out. Great. You okay, Simon? Oh, fine, just got a lot in my mind. One too many drinks with Bertie? Well, you must have gotten late last night. Must have been asleep by the time you got home. How did everything... So what's on the agenda today? Nothing. Just myself. Well, you definitely deserve a rest. Simon? Sorry, sorry. What is it then? Did something happen with Bertie last night? What, no, no, nothing's happened. Well, what is it then. Bertie's offered me a place with his staff in London. Which was always the plan, right? Well, I thought that'd be an easy decision. It is, it is. If it goes his way, Bertie offered a ministerial position in prisons. I thought you'd be excited about that, though. Big role. It's just more than I expected. Just gotta get my head around things. Right, well, whatever happens, you know, we are proud of you and what you're doing. Okay. You're done? Yeah. Come on, let's go and get those teeth brushed, ready for school then. Bertie, Bertie, Bertie. Is this a done deal for Labour, Bertie? Have you done enough to swing this seat, Mr. Oldcross? Bertie, how will you shore up with your campaign? How are you feeling about tonight, Bertie? How'd you sleep last night, Mr. Oldcross. I slept very well, thank you. It's been a long campaign and I'm glad it's over. The people of Scarborough and Whitby as well as across the country can finally go to the polls to make their choice. Thank you very much. Do you have any comments on missing local man, Adam Roberts? I'm sorry? Adam Roberts, reported missing by his wife last night after failing to return home. I wasn't aware of that. The appeal's just gone out to the local press. Do you have anything to say to his family? Well, as I said, I, I wasn't aware of it, but my thoughts of course, with his wife and family, and I hope to hear of his safe return home soon. Morning Bertie, let's get you checked in, then you can cast your vote. You've just missed the pre-work rush, so it's nice and quiet for you. Has Simon been here? Turnout looks pretty good so far. Obviously we're expecting a bit of a flurry around lunchtime. Mrs. Robinson, has Simon been in? Then of course after work, there'll be another rush. So really, you've timed it perfectly to Mrs. Robinson, Mrs. Robinson, please, have you seen Simon this morning? No, he hasn't been in yet. Let's get you sorted. Bertie Oldcross. ID, please. Use the booths at the back, one cross only. I killed Adam Roberts. I killed Adam Roberts. I killed Adam Roberts. I killed Adam Roberts... All done? I won't ask who he voted for. Over here, Mr. Oldcross. Thanks Mr. Oldcross. Bertie, Bertie Mr. Oldcross is back in the vehicle, over. There's a person reported missing. Adam Roberts. Local press asked if I had any information. They've been asked to put out an appeal. Right, well, I've got to go and speak to his family, get some details. Right. So I'll drop you home now, but I'll be back later to escort you to the count. Right, okay. Okay then. Come on, Simon, come on, pick up, please. Hello, your call cannot be taken at the moment, so please leave your message after the tone. Around the country are reporting incredibly high turnouts in this landmark general election. Schools, churches, and community halls opened their doors at 7:00 AM this morning to welcome voters, determined to have their say on which party is most fit to run the country. Oh, you're in here. Sit down there with daddy while I'll go and get your swimming stuff. Open their doors at 7:00 AM this morning All okay? Just keeping an eye on things. Picture of the Scarborough Gazette. Bertie is on the front page. Among the voters were the candidates themselves, each visiting their local constituency polling station to put the next Adam Roberts. I know, awful story. He just disappeared last night, apparently. Alice, sweetie, why don't you show daddy that picture he made today while I'll go sort your bag, I'll be two minutes. Did you make this at school? Yep. What's this That's me, that's mummy, and that's when you win your competition. Win my competition? Yep, for today. That's definitely one for the fridge, aint it? Definitely. I don't think she knew what was happening really, but obviously she's picked up more than we thought. So what time do you think the count will come in? Just, I thought maybe we could all go as a family, or share the moment, you know. Probably not till the small hours. I know, but I'd like to be there for you then. And Alice, obviously have some idea what's going on. Be nice for us to go as a family together. Right, let's get you to swimming. Go on, give daddy a hug. See you later. On the 1st of July. They will also face economic challenges domestically, a topic which has led the campaign of both major parties throughout the election, as they seek support in new parts of the country for the next millennium, as well as continuing work in the Northern Ireland peace process as the country moves on from... To start, I'd like to thank you for choosing to put your trust in me. Dishonesty and selfishness have become an unfortunate trait of our politics over the last few years. The time has come for change, and I am both honored and excited to be given the chance to deliver it. I chose to become a politician because of my sister, Janet. Janet was a police officer, kind and caring. She wasn't just trying to enforce the law. She saw her job as trying to help the people in her community in any way she could. Janet was my inspiration. A year and a half, a year and a half ago, she was killed on duty by a man she was arresting for stealing a purse. It contained 30 pounds. 30 pounds. Losing my sister broke my heart. She was my world, my rock, and that man took her life over 30 pounds. And why? Because he was desperate. Desperate to put food on the table, desperate to provide for his family, desperate to survive in a society that had abandoned him beyond hope, and it's for that reason, I had to... forgive him. That's why I became a politician. I knew I had to find a way to stop this happening again to another person, another family. Hello, your call cannot be taken at the moment, so please leave your message after the tone. Simon, I know I said I'd let you take the day, give you time and space to make your own decision. I want to make sure we both make the right choice here. We've got a chance to really make a difference. We started this thing to help people. We can still do that. If we only get a year at this, or a month, a week even, to me, it's worth doing. It's worth doing together. Simon... We have Bertie Oldcross Labour's candidate for Scarborough and Whitby in the studio, ahead of polling day tomorrow. Thanks Jen. No, please, thank you Bertie for spending your final campaign hours chatting to us and taking calls from listeners. Not at all. My pleasure. So Tony Blair's new Labour, I mean, it's all been a bit crazy isn't it? How do you fit into all this? It's incredible, being at the center of this whirlwind, you can really feel people's excitement. The campaign's been a lot of fun. Oh, well, I mean, let's be honest, the election's in the bag, surely. It's looking promising, but until the votes are counted, anything can happen. And what about the people of our wonderful seaside town? The people of Scarborough and Whitby have been amazing, really receptive of our message. They want change. That's been made very, very clear. And I am the man who can bring that about. Right, oh, I'm getting the word from our producer that we're ready to take a few calls. So should we crack on? Please. Okay, on the line is Caroline, a dinner lady from Whitby High? All right, Caroline. Hello. What's your question for Bertie, Caroline? Hi, Bertie. Afternoon, Caroline. First of all, I'd just like to say how fantastic it is to see a local face on all these posters, such a handsome face too. Thank you so much, Caroline. Did you have a question, Caroline? Oh, yes, well, I've lived in Scarborough all my life. It's always been a peaceful friendly place, but for the first time in my life, really, I don't feel very safe. I'm sorry to hear that, Caroline. You know what, listen Bertie, I do love you, Bertie, but my granddaughters walk to school each morning, scared. It's an absolute disgrace. You're right, Caroline, it is a disgrace. No one should ever feel unsafe on our streets, and I hate to hear that your granddaughters do. I promise that a vote for me tomorrow means we can start putting more officers on the ground with better training. Our children should feel safe walking to school. You know, this is a problem we're seeing right across the country which unfortunately is a direct result of poor social policy by the conservative government. To me, everyone is important. I'll ensure that our offices truly understand the local people and the problems they face. Now, if we can implement that across the country, we will be building a community that is far better equipped to serve everyone. Anything to add, Caroline? You've definitely got my vote, Bertie, and if you do win tomorrow, I'll go for a swim in the fountain in my knickers. Right, thanks there, Caroline. Moving on, how do you in intend to pay for all this Bertie? I mean, this is pie in the sky thinking, no? Jen, everything's laid out in our manifesto. Under a Labour government, no individual will be overlooked or forgotten. We won't try to sweep our problems under the carpet. That's how I intend to tackle the rising crime and how the Labour party will offer true prosperity to all the people of Great Britain. That was a grand plan, Bertie. Things can only get better. Wow, our switchboard is really lighting up. So you ready for another caller? We have Lenny from Barrow Cliff. All right, Lenny, what's your question? Around the United Kingdom... Numbers looking healthy going into the polls tomorrow. Our estimate puts you at almost 20%. Same story with the party across the country, We're over the line. Thanks Simon, for everything. We make a great team. People love you. I hope it goes without saying there's certainly place for you in my office at Westminster. From Scarborough to parliament. Can't think of anyone I'd rather do this with. Well then, old man, I'd better tell Sarah, Darling, we are moving to London. I shouldn't be too long. Soon as Alice is in bed, I'll be back for you. Please, family comes first. These end of campaign parties are just a booze up for the volunteers anyway. Oh, I don't think it's too preemptive to start familiarizing yourself with this. I'll be back around nine, latest. Across the country, reports from our final polls are flying in. The Northeast is predicted to swing heavily towards Labour in tomorrow's voting with Durham and Middlesbrough deep in the red. The biggest shock is expected in Scarborough and Whitby where Labour are polling at 20 plus points ahead. It would seem Bertie Oldcross can do no wrong in the race for that seat. Moving down south, we see a similar picture in London. We have Tony Blair's Labour predicted to steal seats across the capital in what could be a landslide result for his party. To start, I'd like to thank you for choosing to put your trust in me. Dishonesty and selfishness have become an unfortunate trait of our politics over the last few years. The time has come for change, and I am both... honored, honored and excited to be given the chance to deliver it. Honored and excited. Honored, and excited... Sorry, I'm a tad late, ready to rock and roll? Nearly there. If you say so. Did you get a chance to read it then? Ah, yes, yes, yes. And? A winner as always. It's strange to think tomorrow's result, well, may only be the beginning. At least tonight we can celebrate a campaign superbly run. True. Even if you do say so yourself. Shall we? Mind if I drive. Fine by me. Let's hear it then. What's that? The speech obviously. Well, I'm not sure I know it all that well yet. Just bridge the gaps with anything that comes naturally. To start, I'd like to thank you for choosing to put your trust in me. Dishonesty and selfishness have become an unfortunate trait of our politics over the last few years. The time has come for change and I am both honored and excited to... Simon. Look at me, Simon. This is bad, Bertie. We need to get help. Hey, we need to call an ambulance or the police. Simon breathe, take a breath and listen to me. We are not calling anyone. Listen to what I'm saying. We're going to get this man off the road and back to my house where we can make a proper rational decision about what we're going to do. Yes? No, Bertie, please, we need to call someone. Simon, I'm telling you, we are not calling anyone. This isn't right, Bertie. As clocks across the United Kingdom strike 10 and polls closed for the 1997 general election, we can give you the results of our exit poll from voters around the country. There it is, 10 o'clock, voting is now closed and our exit poll is predicting a landslide victory for Tony Blair and the Labour Party. Stay with us through the night as we bring you live results from constituencies around the United Kingdom as counts are confirmed. Not looking too bad for you guys as it stands. Sorry. The count, it's going well for your party. Looks like it could be a big moment. Definitely, very exciting times. So was there any news about that missing man? Did his wife say anything helpful? I know it sounds hard, considering, but I can't actually say anything to you Although after tonight, that may be a different story. Any sign of Simon. He didn't come with you? I left a message for him when I heard the result was closed. I can try again. No, I'm sure he'll be here in a minute. Oh, I'd like to give a quick thanks to all of our volunteers for your speedy work over the past few hours. Now we are preparing to deliver, so if I could get all candidates to the stage so we can proceed, please. Thank you. Righty-ho, all here. Good stuff, good stuff. So in a moment I'd like you all to step onto the stage and line yourselves up at the back, at which point I will proceed to announce the vote count for each candidate and finish by confirming the winner. All clear so far? Perfect. Now we have been notified that our declaration will be televised, okay, very exciting, and the winning candidate will be invited obviously to say a few words at the microphone once the formalities of the declaration have been fulfilled. All clear? Okay, if you'd like to step onto the stage, we are ready to declare. Good luck to you all. As Scarborough and Whitby returning officer, it is my duty to return the result for the election held on May 1st, 1997, for this parliamentary seat. The total number of votes cast were 54,321. The results are as follows: With 2,191 votes, Jane Toole, the Referendum Party. With 7,672 votes, Tony AHL-DEH-BRAH, Liberal Democrat. With 19,667 votes, Joe PIHK, Conservative Party. With 24,791 votes, Bertie Oldcross, Labour Party. Labour win the seat! To start, I'd like to thank you for choosing to put your trust in me. Dishonesty and selfishness have become an unfortunate trait of our politics over the last few years. The time has come for change. And for this reason I must make a confession.
