In association with presents a film by Romas Zabarauskas starring director of photography, film editor, sound designer producers written and directed by Jonas! What? I'll wait. Matas. I'm afraid. Have you already finished? Your brother decided so... Did you change the time? May God forgive you. For what? For your sins. Jonas, Jonas! Father wanted so... How do you know? From the last blessing. What last blessing? He died in the hospital. When it started, he called an ambulance, and he had a heart attack only in the hospital. What? What? Why didn't you tell me? He didn't want to see you. He asked not to call. He didn't believe in God. Everyone does before dying. You set him against me. You set the whole family against me. May God forgive you. He punished you because he loved you. When you love, you can't make concessions. One can't be lenient with the delusion. God's love is the same. Strict, harmful but loyal. I pray for you, Jonas. I think a lot about it. What happened that you got lost and and demonstrated your delusion as a lifestyle. It's not coming from God. It's Satan's work. Thou art thyself though, not a Montague. What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot, nor arm, nor face, nor any other part belonging to a man. O! be some other name: What's in a name? That which we call a rose by any other name, would smell as sweet? Poshly dressed Lina is hitchhiking. Lina's wet t-shirt shows her breasts. Read the dialogues. Lina: thanks for stopping. Don't read the names. Thanks for stopping. Why is such a beautiful girl like you stranded on the highway when it's raining? I had a fight with my husband. He's rich but horrible when it comes to women psychology. I hope you didn't think that I... That you? It's absurd. Matas. I hope you don't think that I'm a whore. I have never used these kind of services. I'm powerless to resist your voice and beauty. I think we'll have to stop again. Calm down and stop pretending. Unlike your husband, I do understand women psychology. I never thought such films have scripts. I thought they improvised everything. It's not really that kind of film... Jonas. Have you ever been with a woman besides Akvil?? Matas... Please, tell me. You know I haven't. It means you like women. I don't like women or men, I like you. And there was a time you liked Akvil?. Stop it. You stop it. How are you going to act with her? How should I feel? We have lived together for five years. You should trust me. It doesn't have anything to do with it. It does. Have you seen the graffiti in the stairwell? What graffiti? Go and see. FAGS GO HOME. SICK OF FAGS. Oops, everything is falling. You've taken away my man with these films. Look, Matas, I just want to help. I would give Jonas money anyway, but he won't take it, you know that. Alright, I'm just kidding... Before it was you who took Jonas from me. What are you two gossip girls slandering about? Keep talking! I'll keep the envelope. Thanks. So what are we drinking to? Um... to the film. I guess? No way, let's drink to men! To men! To men! No really, I was thinking on the way over here how good it is to have men with whom you can drink to men. We can drink to women as well! Oh stop it, why? I've never understood heterosexual men. And I've never understood gay men. And women. No one... No really, how can it be beautiful? Breasts... they're so flat and static! Don't say that! This view is strangely beautiful. And you are strangely beautiful. You know what I like about gay relationships in Lithuania... That they don't care. No wait, I mean... Many people don't like you, slander, talk about you, and yet you are still together. Like a caprice. A caprice? Wait, I mean... Love... Real love. I talk nonsense somehow. Maybe I can stay the night at your place? Alright. Something happened? I'll bring some water. What's that? Was it him? You went back to him again? Why, Akvil?? I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Answer it, answer it. The one who lets himself be harmed, will harm himself. Hey. Hello. I'll just finish these and leave. Well you don't have to... Where's Jonas? Still asleep. Listen, you shouldn't leave the money like that. Wait, where's this Eiffel Tower from? We got it in Paris a few years ago. Have you been to Paris? You know... we were thinking of leaving for Paris after the shoot. Just don't tell Jonas that I told you, OK? OK, but how about your friends? What friends? You can come visit us. We don't have any more friends. And family? My parents live in a village. They don't care if I'm in Vilnius, Paris or elsewhere. I'll come visit for Christmas and that will be enough. And Jonas? And what about Jonas? You know that he doesn't get along with his family. You know, after that trip to Paris, I really wanted to come back, but... But? But just... I was afraid to tell Jonas, I thought he wouldn't understand, just laugh about it. But when he started to star in these films, he changed a bit. Or no, he changed before. When? After his father died. And his mother? What about his mother? I don't know, they had a fight at the funeral. Why are you asking me all this anyway? You know Jonas better than I. I knew him. Five years ago. "The Port of Passion" Hi. Hi. You know I wanted to tell you... I'm sorry to have attacked you about these films. It was a good decision we really need to go. I don't care. What do you mean? Nothing. What do you mean, nothing? Nothing, I'm just kidding. What were you doing all day? It's not funny. Didn't you prepare any dinner? Why are you so mean? I'm not! It's in the fridge, get it yourself! Couldn't you heat it up? What's wrong with you? Nothing. I work, so you can make us something to eat. And I did, I always do. Besides I work as well, I'm writing my thesis. I don't know why I have to be dependent on you. Don't start with this again, you wanted me to sit at home. Bullshit. Besides, I help as much as I can with my scholarship. And you're buying things that are too expensive. You know what costs the most for me? You. Have you forgotten whose apartment we're living in? My aunt's. It doesn't make sense to have a fight about dinner! That's the point - all housework is just nonsense to you. I'll cook some pasta. Stop, don't cook. Listen to what I'm saying. You're very spoiled. I'm not willing to listen to you, you're just blaming everything on me. You are very ungrateful. Take that back. You are very ungrateful. You're writing your thesis and you don't care about anything else. I can't throw it all away and just go to work. You can. And why? Why should I have to work if you star in porno films? And I don't think that you do it just for the money. You like it. You feel like a real man while doing it. A good son for your father. You're asking for it. I'm telling you, you're asking for it. Don't go near me. Don't go near me, I told you. Hello. You are late. It had to start already. Late for what? It's strange that you live by our school. Aren't you disturbed when you pass by it? Do you know where Matas is? He's here. On stage. Where we acted together so many times. What do you mean, Akvil?? You're breathless? Just like when we had sex. Do you remember it? I do. You were breathing this hard. Do you hear me? I do. I just want to know that you didn't run away, call the police or someone else. I don't want to ruin this act. It has been a while since I played anything serious. Porno is a serious deal, but boring. Tell me something. Don't do anything to Matas, please. That's it. That's it. Don't ruin the act with your improvisation. You were always improvising your lines, it was irritating. Now I'm on the same stage. Where we played all kinds of stupid things. It all seemed serious. Our relationship seemed serious. Dreams. To leave. To act. To go to Hollywood... But then you met Matas. Everything was over. You never took the entrance exam. I was searching for your eyes, your love, your support. Nothing. You were with him. I failed it. Look. Now look who I have become without you. I'm one step away from becoming a whore. My boyfriend could be my pimp. You told me everything yourself. As if you wouldn't understand what I feel. You said you were attracted to a friend, you didn't know what was happening to you I'm not a fool. I understood it all. I understood it before you did. I pretended that it was alright. That you had to find your way. You think... it was easy for me to see you two together all those years? To pretend to be a good supportive friend? I was dying of jealousy. And now. After all these years. You had finally accepted to act with me. Yes, to act. You knew you could earn easy money with me. You wouldn't earn that much with a beginner. You were trapped in me like a bone in a throat. I'm choking, but I can't get you out, you're stuck in me forever. You touched me, you took me, you loved me. It doesn't matter that it was just a film. When Matas told me that you were going away... I couldn't understand it, Jonas. And now I started to improvise. What a fool I am. What are you doing there? Don't talk with the guard. Have you forgotten where the stage is? Go upstairs! One thing you didn't know until now I was pregnant. You left me alone with your son. I told my mom about it. She understood it: about you, about Matas, about the child. It's alright. It's alright. No one will know, no one will know. You would have stayed with me if I had told you. Your brother would have married us in a church. Your father would have bought us a house, a car, clothing for our child. He had always dreamt about children. About grandchildren. Why didn't you tell me? 'Cause I knew you wouldn't forget him. Just like I didn't forget you. If you had known, would you have stayed with me? It's not coming from God. It's Satan's work. You know... we were thinking of leaving after the shoot. You've taken away my man with these films. Love... ...real love.
