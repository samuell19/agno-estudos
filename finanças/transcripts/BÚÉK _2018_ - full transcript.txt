Happy New Year Change the lipstick. - Why? - lt doesn't suit you. And hold your hair together. - l can't be a little sexy? - You're sexy like that. How?. When it's not so obvious. Like a rough diamond. Gray and boring? l'll just keep polishing it. We'll be late. We wanted a soccer team, remember? We've got to get down to it... This one... will be a fullback. - Why is the TV on if you're not watching? - l'm listening. So is the whole neighborhood. - Aren't you going to Aliz's? - Yes, we are. And you must show that much skin there? - Little thieves! l want my phone back. - C'mooon! We won't meet before tomorrow. l wish you a very Happy New Year! Mom, can l come with you to the party? - You'll party with Grandma. - You mean, we'll watch TV. Mother, don't let them watch TV, alright? She will anyway. You hear me? Gabi, tell her not to let them watch TV, will you? - Got to wrap up the cake, too. - A cake again? - To make Krist?f think his stuff is shit? - But if it is. Shall we go? How's the party? You hardly know them? They're your neighbors. What do you mean, like a tenants' meeting? Yes, wait... Alright. l'm not leaving you alone, mom. You know l'm on duty today. l've got to go. l'm at the hospital. Happy New Year! Right, l'll call you. Bye! What took you so long? l ran out of parsley and had to go get some. - They're almost here. - You just need to warm everything up. What's-her-name is coming? - Who? - Errr, Csilla... You mean, Eszter? - Sorry... - They all look the same. Why bother with names? Call her what you want, we broke up 2 months ago. - And you didn't tell me? - l did. Wow, Krist?f, it's beautiful! You saved me. - Hi, Krist?f. - Hi, Zs?fi. - You got some coconut rolls for me? - A truckload. - Not too healthy. - That's why it's so good. Mom wanted me to take beet chips. - Going to a party? - l am. Until the morning. - 1 a.m. - No one leaves a New Year's party at 1 ! But you'll give it a try, right? Krist?f, please, talk to her. She's 16... Right... and l found a condom in her bag. When do you have to go? - Don't know. After midnight. - And how do l get home? - You call a taxi. - Like it was so easy today. - What's wrong? - How about a New Year's Eve together? Finally a day off, and you go to the restaurant anyway. The boss wanted a nightcap, what could l say? That you're busy. lt's only an hour. C'mon, it's party time! - That's what you wanted, right? - Right. - Are they here? - ln a minute. Wow! You're pretty. You sure about that blouse? You don't like it? Well, it's pretty flirty... l like it. Who's going to be there? A few girls, just the usual. - And M?t?? - No way! Merci would never invite him. Are you sure? l am. You were right, he's not cool. How about this one? lt's cute, and you've never put it on. You mean, l can't wear what l want? Of course, you can. Your body, your decision. Can l stay until the morning then? Please! You want to tell me about this? - Not mine. - Zs?fi! lt's true! Merci thinks her mother would search her bag. l didn't search your bag, l needed a pen... Doesn't matter. l wanted to give it back, anyway. You can tell me anything, you know that? Mom, if l wanted to sleep with someone, you'd be the first to know. Good. Too bad you didn't like that lipstick. - l look like l was going to work. - Don't need all that make-up. Last time your friends called me an arts major. Because you're smart. That's not what they meant. Can you check who it is? - M?ni. - Don't answer it, it's my day off. - And if it's urgent? - l'm not the on-call photographer. And if the Parliament has burnt down? We'll open a bottle of champagne. - You shouldn't just search her bag. - She's 16. l want to keep an eye on her. You believe her about the condom? She wouldn't lie to me. And she's not seeing anyone. - And what about that M?t? guy? - Thanks God, it's over! l knew she'd finally come to her senses. - He was awful. - But she liked him. lt's really not your business, Krist?f! l know what's good for her. l'm her mother after all... Have you found it? Did M?rk take it? ls it so obvious? lt's very good. He's wasting his time at Zenit. l needed a few pictures for my articles... - Will you post it? - l don't know yet. A divorc?e posting sexy photos of herself? - Could you open it? - No problem. - Krist?f, Happy New Year! - You too! - Hi! - Hello! How did you get in? Some kids were leaving for beer. But they didn't seem thirsty. - The neighbor's throwing a party. - Great! ln case we get bored here. - Brought some cheesecake. - Sorry! - Why? lt's better than Krist?f's. - l didn't make any sweets. l knew you'd try to make mine look like shit. Good, no more poppy seed rolls. - l like your dress. - Really? His mom says it's slutty. How is she doing? - Meanness has preservative effects. - l've heard that! The only good thing about divorce, game over for his mom, too. Lucky you are. lt must be M?rk and Fanni. Come on in. What's up with you and Lizi? - l'm on it. - You just wish. - No need to rush. - But B?lint moved out a year ago. l'll tell her today. lt was my last New Year's resolution. You just need to step up, be a man and if she says jump... - Krist?f! - l'm coming. ...you don't say how high. You want to come in? No, thanks. Are you sure? Uh-huh. Too bad. See? l didn't get stuck. Next time we'll party downstairs. - Happy New Year, Lizi! - Hi! - The others? - ln there. This is special. lt's biodynamic. - l've always wanted to try. - And some poppy seed rolls. Wow! How nice! Just get in there. - Hi! - lt's an honor! No Bali because of us. - Bali? - Where l usually go with my colleagues. And what do you muffdoctors talk about? - Not about that. - Sure you do. - You look great, Saci. - And you look skinny. Hello! - Who wants a drink? - l do! - Me too! - Aren't you driving? No. l drink first and then l drive. - M?rk? - He is not drinking. Really? l thought you wouldn't last for a week. lt's been 104 days, man! - l bet you know it in minutes, too. - l will miss those New Year throwups. That's it! No booze, no smoking, no gambling. lf l had a dog, l'd be like Francis of Assisi. - And we'd call the animal control. - Cheers! Cheers! - This place is awesome, Aliz. - Thanks. l've just remodeled it. l love your style. All these... l'm so sorry! ls this some kind of sculpture? - lt's a Friendship Stupa. - What? A Christmas gift from a therapy group. lt means we belong together. They made it out of clay. They each made one? Cool! With a piece of themselves in it, ...like their hair, nails or tears. - Ugh! - What about D?me? - He's late as always. - l hope he brings his new old lady. - Her name is M?rta. - Have you met her? - No. lt's been 3 months, though. lf she can stand him that long, she must be nuts, too. - You're no jackpot either, and married to a posh lawyer. Maybe she's just old. - She must be better than Adrienn. - Adrienn? D?me's ex. The most aggressive woman you can imagine. - Don't be such jerks. - Why? You hated her too. Called her Miss Kim Jong-un. Behind her back. But you laughed into her face. Must be D?me and M?rta. Did you get in? Could you be a little less obvious? How long can it take? lt must be the walking frame. C'mon! lt's my brother's girlfriend. They're coming. Hi, everyone! What? Where's the granny? l mean, M?rta... She says sorry, but she got sick. Here's some champagne. Too bad, M?rta didn't make it. - lt would be nice to finally meet her. - She has high temperature, she coughs really bad, she can hardly sleep. OK, but how old is she? What do you mean? You can tell us, if she's a little old. - A mature lady. - She isn't old at all. But does she remember the 56 revolution? The Habsburgs? The Golden Bull? - You really want to marry this guy? - Well, he got me this beautiful ring. Wow! lt is beautiful. Got a microscope? l didn't think any woman could tame him. There is only one, and she hit the jackpot as a reward. And she bitterly regrets it, l believe. Sit down and l'll bring the hors d'oeuvre. Krist?f! - You want to show a photo of M?rta? - l don't have any. You must have a photo of her in you phone. - Do you have a photo of me? - And what are we going to eat? Why didn't you go to Bali, after all? Because you asked me if l wanted to cook. - You could've just said no. - l'm happy you asked me. And that's why you didn't go? Because of us? No. Because of you. - Jesus! Do l look that bad? - What? Not at all! Thanks! You're a true friend. l'm doing alright, l swear. Lizi, that's not what l meant... Sorry... lt's my mom... Hi mom, l'll call you back. Wait! Not now. - What hamster? - Get the wine, will you? l don't know. Because l'm a gynecologist, not a vet. l don't care about its tumor. Hippocratic, but it doesn't apply to hamsters. Mushroom basket and vegetable muffin. - ls that true, Lizi? - What? - D?me says you have filed for divorce. - l didn't know it's a secret. No, it isn't. lt was about time after a year. l'll try the shrooms. And B?lint was ready to settle? He had financial problems and needed the money. - Right, young girls cost a lot. - Old ones too, if they want to look young. - You alright? - Of course. What's gone is gone. l wanted to drink to this. lt's amazing that you take it with such grace. Well, we loved each other, then we let each other go. lt happens. You can't be so grateful. l'm officially outraged in the name of all women. - Did l miss anything? - They are getting divorced. You hear that, Krist?f? You didn't tell me. Surprise. l thought we could celebrate tonight. With this. We've saved it for our anniversary. Then B?lint can come to Malta, right? - Are you out of your mind? - Why, if Lizi doesn't mind? Why not? You may ask him. You're incredible! l'm only trying to move on without hatred. Let me get a wine key. And you think B?lint should bring that panty model? ls it a question? He can't afford it. He was fired form the insurance company. We can ask, if she doesn't mind. - Then l'm out. - Why? Because he is a sneaky bastard. Lizi might forgive him but l won't. The wine key. Will you open it? We might not go either. No day shifts in the restaurant. Big deal. We're still good with my bonus. Great! lf l get some pocket money, l can buy ice-cream and candy. - ls it a problem that l make money? - No, but get it in small bills so you can stuff them in my shorts. lt's still sad that a text message can ruin a family, isn't it? Actually it was that model girl. But if Lizi hadn't read it, they might still be together. - You mean it's my fault? - No way, B?lint's. Who would keep a hot text message? You delete it right away. lt's not rocket science. - What are you talking about? - l mean in the old days, before l met you. Alright, let's drink to Lizi, and her new life. - To Lizi! - Cheers! The muffin is great, right? - A little overdone. - Thanks. l've read in an article that about 40?/? of divorces have something to do with phones. lt's because guys love them more than their wives. But if they're more reliable. l bet we'd be surprised, if we checked each other's. l'd be surprised, if Gabi let you check his. - l do, if you show yours. - Well, mine's really interesting. You can chat with my clients about plaints and contracts. And l have a really sexy exchange of messages with the pediatrician. And you, Fanni? Would you let M?rk see yours? Of course. l don't even have a pin code. But l don't want her to show me. Have you guys heard of trust? Krist?f? l've got some juicy pictures on mine. A patient keeps sending me photos of her breasts to see if her areola changed. - Sexy! - Spiced with the charm of a 69 year old. So there are only saints here, nobody has any secrets. - l didn't say that. - Nobody, except for D?me. We're too old to have real secrets. - lt's pretty sad. - Let's see then. What do you mean? l mean, we all put our phones on the table, and tonight we share every call, text message, e-mail or chat message. - ls that your idea of a New Year's party? - l don't care. lt's easy for you, M?rta is in bed with fever and old age. Why isn't it easy for you? Why can't we just play some proper drinking games? When Krist?f says Lizi, we drink. - We'd be drunk in 20 minutes. - l agree. Do you have any secrets? Why don't you want to play? And if you get a confidential call? l'm in special education. No secrets about dyslexia. Really? l thought you were in some kind of arts. So? You'll put it out or not? Here you go. l still think it's a stupid game. l hate that people always mess with their phones. l hate it too. Some of our guests put their phones on the table to show off. Never mind the hours spent on sous-vide cooking or the pur?e. They don't look at anything but their phones. - Better than keeping it face down. - What? You always put it face down so that l can't see. - lt's just a bad habit... - lt's time to break that habit. - You really want to play this? - Do you have any problems? - lt's just stupid. - l agree. But l think it's funny, so unless you're expecting a secret call... Alright. Here you go. lf it makes you guys feel better... Krist?f? You're the only one left. - l don't think it's a good idea either. - Only if everybody is in. So? Are we playing or not? Alright. lf that's what you want. Check and see if they're not in flight mode. Damn! You're tough. - Honey, yours is in flight mode. - Sorry, my stupid boss keeps calling me. Can we look into them, too? - Only calls or messages. - Facebook? - No Facebook. - Why not? lt's New Year's Eve. We're going to read Happy New Year all night. What's that? Happy New Year! - Who's she? - Niki from the cafeteria at work. Must be a good friend, if she sends you photos like this. And another 52 people as far as l can see. Hi, everyone! Hi! Can l get some money for taxi? We didn't know you were at home. - Sorry, l had to chat with someone. - What a compulsion. Where's my bag? Oh, l only have a 20,000 bill... l have some change in my coat. At least l can get a kiss from my favorite niece. - What's this? - You don't want to know. - A Friendship Stupa. - And it must be right here? - That's the Corner of Harmony. - She always knocks them over, too. What a beautiful girl! She was sleeping with big, fury animals just now. - lt might happen again soon. - We're not there yet. Yeah, right. At 16 l was fooling around behind my mother's back. Zs?fi is not like that. We discuss everything. Another one. l want your body?! The game is on. What's this supposed to mean? - l don't know. - lt's that Niki again? lt's an unknown caller, you see? - Why would an unknown caller write this? - l swear l have no idea. Answer it. - Alright. - C'mon! Alright, alright! Put it on speakerphone. Hello! Hello! Hello! Who the hell are you? Hello! - Stop messing with me! - But l want to mess around with you. What a faggot! Are you really such a jerk? - Really. - You should see your faces. - l'm about to rearrange yours. - l told you it was stupid. - Can l get it back? - Sorry. You'll be home by 1 a.m. - 1 :30? - Max. Thanks, mom. - Bye, enjoy the party! - Bye! You're lucky. Dorka is only 9, but she knows no respect. Teenagers are fine. You just have to speak their language. Right, D?me? lf you respect them, they'll respect you back. C'mon, you must hate kids, you're a teacher. l don't hate them. - He's the star of the school. - As a chemistry teacher! l wouldn't go that far. - Why don't you have kids then? - What about you? - We're working on it, right honey? - Really? - We've just decided. - We have to celebrate it. - What? That they have sex? - That's what you really have to celebrate. l'm going to have a cigarette. Do you drink champagne D?me, when you and M?rta have sex? We couldn't drink that much. - Can l get a refill? - Of course! Not fair! You can drink and l can't? Because unlike you, she's got some brain cells left. l wonder about that. - l thought you quit. - l did. - Everything's OK with Saci? - Of course. We're jamming! - What's wrong? - Nothing. - A little stress, that's all. - What do you mean? No sex? - Are you kidding? - You look tense. That's the one thing l have no problems with. - Man, l can't believe you just said that. - l was just asking. - For 6 months? - Since l got back to work. - But it's not OK. - Are you telling me? He said he's tired, his back hurt, and work problems. We tried a few times but failed badly. - And you're OK? - Me? l'm like a teenager. l almost picked up the plumber the other day. He was about 20. Everything reminds me of sex. - Want me to find a doctor? - l'm done if he finds out l've told you. - You must do something about it. - l know. l'm so wired up l should have a warning sign on me. That's why you're mean with Fanni? - ls it so obvious? - Well... She's driving me crazy. 45 kg of pure innocence. You should go easier on her. - lt can't be easy with M?rk. - l'm not sorry for her. You heard them, they have sex all the time. You need a marriage therapist. Trust me, it can work wonders. Only if he bangs me well. Krist?f! You got one. - Salad anyone? - Me. Who's that? My mother. Again. What should l do? Answer it. Put it on speakerphone. Alright be quiet! l told her l was on duty. - But why? - l'll tell you. - Hi, mom! - We've checked, the hamster is a girl. - Great, and what's it to me? - You're a gynecologist! - Does it have an insurance policy? Pali says it's got a tumor. Maybe expecting a child? - A pup, mom, it's an animal. - He says it's expecting. l didn't say it's expecting... Forget it. l have to go. lt doesn't have a boyfriend. lt can't be pregnant, right? No, it can't. Unless the baby is the new hamster savior. - You shouldn't make fun of religion. - l'm sorry. l have to go. - lt's a shame you have to work today. - lndeed. Too bad we're not together this year. l'll miss you. l'll miss you too. l've got to go. Bye-bye, baby-face! What was that? Just my patients. Got to go now. l'll call you. Bye! Do you celebrate with your mom? OK, l'm the loser of the year. Go ahead and laugh. - Do you go to Bali with her? - Almost. Hotel Corvin in H?viz. lt's been 5 years. What about today? Lizi said she wanted to cook. l thought it's a medical emergency. l told her l was on duty and sent her to the neighbors. But why do you celebrate with your mom? My dad died on New Year's Eve, and my mom hates being alone on this day. So we go to a hotel in H?viz. They spent their honeymoon there. We eat their favorite food, light a candle and feel sorry. l see. But why on earth do you celebrate with your mom? - Shut up! - Don't take it personal, baby-face! - Where were we? - We wanted to drink to sex. Let's drink to M?rta, so that she can survive the next year. - l've told you she isn't old. - You guys are such jerks! lt's no surprise she's afraid of you. l didn't say she was afraid. - l was. - What were you afraid of? That you don't accept me. You've been friends since childhood. And you think we've accepted you? - Well, l thought... - No, no, no. lt's not that easy. We've been stuck with D?me for years, but we haven't accepted him. - Don't even worry about them. - They're just kidding. Don't listen to them. Tell her you've accepted her. Of course, we have. We love you, just don't see what you like in this guy. She couldn't resist my charm. You mean, your addiction to gambling and your debts? - He hasn't been gambling for months. - Not that l would've had the guts. Who's that? M?rta? An old colleague you don't know. Let's skip it. No way! lt's the rule, answer it. - Hi, Zsuzsi! - Hi D?me, can we talk? l'm at my friend's house, l can't talk right now. No problem. l'll just wish you a happy New Year then. You too, darling. One more thing. Have you found a job yet? We'll talk about it. They still don't have anyone to replace you. Students keep asking about you. Nobody knows why you quit. Alright, l'll call you. - ln case you want to come back... - No, l don't. l have to go. Bye! - You quit your job at M?ra? - l did. - But why? - Because l had enough. Of teaching? Of the students, the colleagues, the parents, the shitty pay. lf you lived in a rental like mine, you'd understand. Why didn't you tell us? ls this some kind of an inquisition? l though l'd find something first, but l haven't so far. - What do you want to do? - l don't know. There's not much demand for unemployed chemistry teachers. Be a gynecologist, like Krist?f. He can get away with telling a woman right away to open her legs. They even pay me for that. Come to my office. My boss has a headhunter firm. Wow! That too? - Maybe he can help. - l'm sure he can. He's such a genius. - What's wrong? - l'm just amazed what a player he is. A posh lawyer, headhunter. l'm sure he feeds orphans in Africa, and finds the medicine for cancer. What else does he know?. He knows when to shut up. - More wine anyone? - Me. Brought some Pinot noir. Alright, red wine then. lt's better with pork anyway. First you should answer it. - You won't get off so easily. - Only my dad. - Hi, dad! - Hi, darling! Are you partying? l have a few friends over for dinner. D?me is here too. - Tell him, Happy New Year! - Well, just call him. l'll call him tomorrow, the lines are busy today. - Zs?fi? - She's OK, she's at her friend's. We're going over to the S?f?rs too. Prof Hidv?gi will be there. What should l tell him about the surgery? l'll think about it. What are you thinking about? Just get it done. He's doing us a favor with that date. The surgeries are booked. OK, l'll discuss it with him. - lf it's the money... - No, it's not the money. ...don't worry about it. But don't let D?me know about it, alright? Hold on! Judit, what the hell... - She's knocking over the thujas. - Listen... Turn the wheel! Alright, l'll call you, bye! An operation? What's wrong? Nothing! Nothing serious, just a little thing. - What do you mean? - l've told you, it's nothing. That Hidv?gi, isn't he a plastic surgeon? Alright, l'm getting breast implants. - Wow! - Are you happy now?. - No big deal. - Are you getting breast surgery? - Why are you so surprised? - You have beautiful breasts. You wrote a book about accepting ourselves. A breast surgery doesn't mean l don't accept myself. What does it mean, then? l'm after giving birth and breast feeding. You'll find out. But Fanni's got a point. She wants bigger breasts, so what? lt's fine, but then you shouldn't preach about acceptance. - C'mon, she isn't preaching. - l accept myself. l totally accept myself, except for my breasts. lt's a routine operation nowadays. And it's also ridiculously expensive. l knew it. l didn't ask him to give me money. But he did. And for your apartment too. But not me, even when my car broke down. lt's a luxury to have an old-timer Saab. Especially when you're unemployed. True, it isn't such a basic need as new tits. Stop fighting. Let's make some music and dance, D?me. - l'd rather get some fresh air. - Let's shake up the party, baby. - Are you coming? - No. - l'll go out with D?me. - Leave your phones here. Alright, l'll get the wine. You need a hand? No thanks, l can handle 2 bottles of wine. Lizi, it's none of my business, but you don't need that operation. - Can we just drop it? - l just don't see why. Because l'm 42. My husband has left me, and l have a 16 year old daughter. Do you think it's an irresistible offer? - l do. - Yeah, right. l do. What was that? What happened? l told you not to drink so much, baby. - Sorry, l slipped. - At least something's happening. You're great, but no need. But if you need a little loan, let me know. lt's not about the money, anyway. My dad is punishing me for... - For what? - Let's go inside, l'm cold. - Wait. l need something from you. - What? l'll get an address at 10. l'll go there tonight, ...but l don't want Saci to ask questions. - Why? - She thinks it's my work. - And it's not? - No, l'll meet a... friend, who gets us an apartment and sends me the address at 10. This friend is a woman? Gabi... - The waitress from the restaurant. - Fuck that! - That's the plan. - Fuck that, you're cheating on Saci. She's srcewing her boss, so l think we're even. - Are you serious? - Of course! Her ex is her boss. Do you think it's OK? - Would you work with your ex? - My ex is a chiropodist. C'mon, D?me! l can't believe you don't understand. You know what? Leave me out of it. - Wait! l need your phone. - What? We have the same phone. We'll swap, and if l get the address, they'll think it's yours. Some women just send me addresses? Why not? You can easily explain it. M?rta is not even here, but Saci will kill me. She has every right to do so. D?me, please! Just this once! Why would you play this stupid game then? l tried to stay out, but it was suspicious. Saci is watching like a Mosad agent. l hate it. You hear me? Do you really want me to beg? That stupid message can arrive at any minute, and l'm finished. - Aren't you freezing out here? - We are! He's already finished. Come on in, the pork is ready. You're not going to help me? - Only an address? - An address, that's all. - And how the hell do we swap them? - l'll take care of it. Thanks! Thanks! - l owe you one. - A big one. Here's the pork. There's sweet potato and braised cabbage. Looks great! You're a real chef. Actually, it was also Krist?f. l just removed the tinfoil and put it in the oven. Great timing! 20 arms, 20 breakouts, 20 hips, what's this? A fitness app. You must do it when it says. ln the middle of dinner? Even at night. But it's very effective. 10 weeks, 10 kg. - When did you start? Today? - What if you ate less pork instead? Just a few minutes. Go ahead and eat. - He's nuts! - l think he's cute. - Let's make room for the pork. - Alright! Breakout, come on. - l can't believe it! - Baby! Sorry! Wait, wait! lt's OK, nothing broke. l'm so sorry, Aliz! Just let me do it. You aren't very good at walking on your two feet. - l like you more in bed. - Not funny. l think it is. - We shouldn't give her more to drink. - l don't think it matters. lf the pork gets cold, it'll ruin the crackling. l'm starving and l don't feel guilty. Thanks, D?me! - Next time l'll call you at 2 a.m. - Who wants to try? Gabi? Of course. - Who's that? - M?ni. - That sounds exciting. - Actually it isn't. lt's his boss. Call me, it's urgent! Do you mind if l skip this one? Aren't we answering every call? - Really want her to make me go to work? - Now?. lf a firecracker blows up in some faggot's hand, we're on it. Please, don't make him call her back! She's about 50 anyway. She is fat and has huge things. - Tits? - Or rather juggs. Send her to Hidv?gi, he'll fix them. - You really checked her out. - l checked out who's bossing him around. Alright, don't call her back then. Who wants some pork? - Me. - Me too. Everybody. Who's got this one? Oh, it's mine. Lilla finally sent her address. 1 7 Vass Gereben Street. Who's Lilla? An old colleague. She's invited me to her new flat. Today? Not today. Some time next year. l'll just tell her it's OK. Your colleague has invited you to her place? Sounds exciting. What's exciting about it? A woman's name alone can make M?rk excited. You are the only one, who can make me excited. Lilla teaches biology, she is married with two adult kids. - What's that? - Nothing. Let me see! Holy balls! Our biology teacher sure didn't look like this. - Must be an accident! - Accidentally no panty? - What a healthy orifice of the uterus! - That's +18! Give it back, it's personal. l'm proud of you. A divorce, new old lady, a lover bending over. lt's a happening scene! What do you mean, lover? - C'mon D?me, this is heavy. - What is she doing anyway? She is a biology teacher using visual aids in anatomy. - Jesus! ls she your girlfriend? - l said, she's just an old colleague. What colleague would send a photo like this? What kind of woman would send photos like this? l'm sorry, that's what l am. l like simple people, who open up like this. That's it. - And what about M?rta? - Nothing. M?rta is doing very well. Let's drop it, shall we? - A message. - To whom? - To you. - What's with the new ring-tone? lt must have been the kids playing. - Here we go. - lt's only an e-mail. Let's see Gabi's message first, then Saci's. - lt's Marci. - What does he say? What's up? - Who's Marci? - A kid from the restaurant. Why is he asking you what's up? We had a little fight, he's curious if l'm still mad. What kind of fight? - He messed up an order. - And? Are you going to answer it? - No. - lt's pretty rude, isn't it? l mean, you should say something. ''l'm fine, l'm at home, talk to you tomorrow.'' - Why should he say he's at home? - She's right. - You're with friends, talk tomorrow. - Alright. - No! - No? - Why should you tell him where you are? - ls it a secret? lt's your private life. Keep it to yourself! Our whole life is on the net, anyway. Where we go on holiday, where we shop, what concerts we see... lnstead of 'How are you?' we ask 'Where are you?' - lt was just a 'What's up?' - lt's nobody's business where l am. Actually nobody cares about where you are. l'm just saying, we all need some intimacy. Or... what do you want? Should we post our private affairs? When we eat or sleep, or have our prostate checked? We've got to draw the line! - Alright, l won't answer it. - Don't answer it, then. Damn! Somebody is wound up tight today. What about your e-mail? Hope it's not 'What's up?' l guess, the usual Happy New Year... lt's my boss. Hi Berry, Happy New Year! Call me, when you have a minute. - Your boss calls you Berry? - That's how lawyers talk. lt's Berry vs. Cherry. l've known him forever. We were dating in college. - Your ex is your boss? - Let's just not... Why not? That's how we roll. He offered 3 times what you make in the restaurant. l should've said, sorry, l don't want to hurt my husband's feelings? - What the hell does he want now?. - l'll call him back. When will you have a minute? When your family is not wasting your precious time? Anyone wants some pork? Fanni, you hardly tried. OK, l'll call him. He's playing golf in Zimbabwe. We can ask him about the weather. He really had to go that far for a lawn with holes in it? You can ask him. Hi, Berry! lt wasn't so urgent. No problem, Happy New Year to you too. l'm working on it. l've booked my ticket for 2 days later. Could you take care of my meeting on Monday with Simonffy? - Of course. - Great! Tell them l'm sorry, l'll be there on the 5th. You must have a good time with your girlfriend. Szandi, right? Well, Szandi isn't here now, but l've met Anik?. - Eniko! - Eniko! That's what l'm saying. - Have a good time then! - You too. Say hi to your family for me. By the way! l've asked about the home, where my aunt was. lt's called Golden Branch. Check it out. lt's a pretty good place. Thanks, Happy New Year! So that would be the boss, who is still dreaming about me. Golden Branch? ls it a retirement home? He had his aunt there and said it was great, so l asked him to get me the name. - But why? You're not that old. - Very funny. For my mother? You want to put her in an old people's home? - lt's more like a hotel. - Did you plan to tell me? lt's only a name. What should l tell you? - That you want to get rid of my mom. - lt's not true! She takes care of the house and the kids, just so that you can do your job. And she keeps reminding me of it, too. Listen, l'm really grateful for her, but she's critical of everything l do. l can't believe you don't see that. - We should've discussed it. - Just like her moving in with us. l think Saci's right. l love M?rk's mother, but l couldn't stand her living with us. - Me neither. - These homes aren't what they used to be. They have huge parks, and people live in apartments. My friend lives in a home like this. You mean, M?rta? Fireworks! You want to check it out? Let's go! Can l take it, Aliz? l'd like to take a photo. OK, but only Fanni. - l'll prepare the cheesecake. - l'll help you. - Can you handle it? - l know your kitchen more than you. - That's not true. - Where's the small Teflon pot then? See? - Jesus, it's cold out here. - No shit, in December? - Who wants a coat? - Me. We want something too. l just need a cardigan. Are you sure, you're alright? ls that what you're going to ask all night? - No, but you look pretty nervous. - l'm not nervous... You think it's OK, if Saci wants to put my mom into a home behind my back? - She would've told you, obviously. - Yeah, right. - We discuss everything... - You don't? We don't. She likes to make her own decisions lately. About her boss, her work, her working hours, her dinner mates, her boss... - You said it twice. - What? - Her boss. - Are you kidding me? lf it bugs you so much, why don't you tell her? Do you think she gives a damn? All she needs is a droid, who follows her orders. - No wonder l need some release. - What are we talking about? - l'm just saying. - But what are you saying? Can we forget about me? What's up with you? The clock is ticking. - l've got time until midnight. - Are you going to talk to her? No, l thought l'd show her my dick. Of course l'll talk to her. l haven't seen your dick yet. lt might be more impressive. - And if she's seeing someone? - Why would she? Saci would know about it. Just a feeling... l think she had a date last time. A date doesn't mean anything. lt just happens, you know. One needs some private life. A little adventure without any pressure. What the hell are you talking about? Quit fucking around! Just talk to her. Look at that, it's beautiful! What's beautiful about some rich asshole burning a hundred grand. - lt's really cold! - Do you want my coat? Only half of it. The cheesecake is ready. - With raspberry dressing? - What else... - We're coming. Just enjoying the weather. - The dressing will get cold. - Let's make a selfie together! - OK! - l'd rather not. - C'mon, don't be so old. - OK, let's get done with it. - Krist?f, can you come out? - What is it? - The young ones are having fun... - Wait! - Move closer. Some more, please. Alright, honey, you're the photographer. D?me, you're outside. Can we talk? - What the hell does he want? - No idea. - Who's lv?n? - Her ex. - Why are you so upset? - l'm not upset at all. Alright, let's take the picture. - But why is he in your phone as lv?n. - That's his name. No family name? He's just lv?n, like Sting or Bono? - But you didn't mind Berry, right? - He's her ex. How do you save your exes? Vir?g Kiss, barber? - Or the local women's handball team? - Very funny, really. - At least l've deleted my exes. - Just because your memory was full. - Shall we take that picture? - l don't give a shit, anyway. Little faggot can call anyone, l just don't see why. - Good thing you didn't get upset. - C'mon, stop it! Smile! l want to fuck! - What did it say? - l want to fuck. - Who doesn't? - Let me explain! l want to fuck? - How the fuck can you explain it? - Maybe it was auto-correct. What stupid program would misunderstand it? What did he mean, l want some luck, or l want my duck? - l'll explain, don't swear. - Well, l'm all fucking ears! OK, but let's go inside. He has a new girlfriend, and she's playing with him. - That's why he wants to fuck you. - Let me finish! lf she wants to have sex, she sends a message. lv?n runs, they fuck, and then she drops him. - What's wrong with it? - lv?n is in love and feels like shit. This guy is an idiot. That's why she turned to a special educationist. Sorry! - What's it to you? - We're friends. ls it so strange? - Yes, it is. - What're you doing? l'll call him. You're just friends, right? - Let me talk to him! - But l want to hear you. Alright! Thanks, thanks! Sorry to bother tonight, but l feel miserable. Did she call you again? She wants me to go over to her place, and l don't know what to do. She'll never take you seriously like that. l know l'll regret it, but all l can think about is her. Turn off your phone, go out, and don't let her manipulate you. - You're right. But it's really hard. - You can do it. That's why l like talking to you. - You can put me in my place. - OK, talk to you later. - Happy New Year and all! - You too. - He's going over to see her. - No doubt. - And you discuss it every time? - Yes, we do. lf she feels horny, he calls you right away? - Because he is suffering. - He should see Lizi, she's the shrink. Or Krist?f, he can just cut off his dick. l'm actually a qualified surgeon too. - Hey! Hands off of the phones! - l just wanted to check the time. - Who wants some raspberry dressing? - Who doesn't? - Why didn't you tell me about it? - What? - That you keep in touch. - lt's not such a big deal. - l don't stay friends with my exes. - Because they all want to kill you. lf you hate it so much, l'll tell him to quit calling me. Alright, tell him. Why should she break off a friendship, just because you don't like it? - Because l don't like it. - Why can't she be friends with her ex? lt's pretty bad, when your girl is friends with someone she you used to fuck. - Zs?fi. - My Zs?fi? - Why is she calling you? - Maybe she couldn't reach you. She hasn't called me. Answer it. - On speakerphone? - C'mon, answer it! - Hi, Zs?fi! - Hi! Can we talk? Not really. Please, it's important. But don't let mom hear you. Alright, go ahead. So this party sucks, but M?t?'s parents are skiing and... M?t? told me to go to his place, to sleep there. l see. - And you? - l don't know what to do. He's really cute and everything, but l didn't think it was going to be today. Or l kind of did, but... l'm actually scared, but he was so cute all night... ...and l don't want him to be angry with me. You see? Don't do it out of fear that he'd be angry. Only if you feel ready, and with someone you really love. l don't know this guy. But if you think you want to share this experience with him, then do it. But if you have any doubts, then just wait, alright? lf he loves you, he'll understand. And if he doesn't, he doesn't deserve you, anyway. l just don't understand... Go ahead. Why did you give me that pack of condoms? When l asked you for the pills, you said you couldn't do it without mom, but then you gave me the condoms. l didn't mean you must use them, l just wanted you to be safe. OK, l'll think about it. Tell mom that l'll sleep at Merci's. - You must tell her yourself. - She won't let me. - Not only that, your whole problem. - But she never listens to me. You just need a little patience. She's all paranoid since dad cut out, she thinks all men are pigs. And she gives advice to others... Mom is a mess, but you're in love with her. Zs?fi! l'll see what happens, but l'm not going home by 1 . lf you don't want her to worry, tell her that l'll sleep here. Thanks! - Lizi! - Excuse me! That was heavy. l think l don't want any kids. Only if they're boys. Trust me, it's not any easier with them. Go ahead and eat, l don't want to reheat the dressing. - Forget that stupid dressing, alright? - Why did l put it out then? - l'll check on Lizi! - No, no! l'll do it! lt's almost midnight. Can we listen to the Anthem? - Are you serious? - No New Year's Eve without the Anthem! - Are you OK? - l am. l'll be right there. Teenagers say all kinds of awful stuff. And they always aim at your weak spot. She didn't know l heard, so she was just being honest. - l only gave her the condoms... - l understand. You did well. At least there is someone she trusts. Even if it's obviously not me. The worst thing is that she's right. Since her dad left, l... l just didn't know it was so obvious... - But it's been a year. - l know that it's been a year. l remember every damn day of that year. But why don't you try to move on, then? Because this wasn't in the plan. lt wasn't supposed to happen like this. And now l don't know what to do. Lizi, what she said about me... l'd like to be alone now, alright? Of course... Give me a few minutes. - Why should we sing a funeral song? - The Anthem is not a funeral song. But it's all whining and mourning. - Let's sing a song everyone likes. - l like the Anthem. - How's she? - A little bummed out that's all. So we can't really ask her for some cool music now, can we? We can't. But can you ask her anyway? - What's that? - Marci again. ''Not even an answer?'' - ls he so pushy at work too? - Answer him and he'll stop. Alright. ''l'm at my friend's, we'll talk tomorrow.'' Let's see if he stops. Fuck you? What the hell is he thinking? - What's that supposed to mean? - No clue. He must be drunk. Perhaps Marci is actually Marcella? What? Marcella? Don't be ridiculous! Now we'll find out. Answer it. l won't. Why? He's an idiot and l don't want to talk to him. - l'll answer it, then. - Wait, alright! Hello. With your friends? Are you serious? And you told me that you're sick and couldn't get out of bed? Making me all worried about you. Busting my ass to make you some chicken soup on New Year's Eve. Do you fucking hear me? What? You don't even answer me? You should've just said that you didn't want to be with me tonight. Or that you're ashamed of me. Alright, l don't give a shit. But it makes me totally sick that you can't make up your mind. Damn... He's totally crazy. l told you he's drunk. C'mon, you can't possibly think that l'm... Give me a break! He's just a gay guy from work, and he's all over me, that's all. C'mon guys... Saci! C'mon, M?rk, tell her. Tell her, Krist?f! Somebody just tell her. Yes, there is a gay waiter he was telling me about. See? - ls he your lover? - What kind of question is this? - A very simple question. - No way! Are you crazy? l'm telling you, he is in love with me. He's totally nuts. He is a pathological liar and he's convinced l'm gay too. Many gay people believe that everyone else is gay. Really? - Why don't you tell him you're not a fag? - l did, but he doesn't listen. Why did you tell him you were sick? He's been bugging me about tonight. What could l have said? That you are married with two kids. That you're not a fag. That is, if you're not. Of course, l'm not a fag. Are you guys crazy? You've known me for 30 years. l drink beer, ride a motorbike, piss in the sink, l do... l burp... We've even watched porn together. - l'm not a fag. - So gay people don't burp. Good to know. And you, Saci? We've been together for 10 years, if anyone knows l like women it's you. - You haven't touched me for 6 months. - Let's not... You don't really want to discuss it. Alright. Look at me! Tell me straight up. Can you imagine me being a fag? Doing a big, hairy ass from behind... l didn't mean to hurt anyone, because l don't care if others do it. But l don't. C'mon, M?rk! l don't! l like women. Only women, you see? Saci! l swear on my mother's life that me and... Marci. ...that we never had anything between us. ''l'm going to miss your kisses at midnight.'' What? What happened? Saci! Don't you think it's too much? How much can you drink, if your husband turns out gay? - lt must be a misunderstanding. - You didn't hear that call. But l know him. We've been friends forever. Married for 10 years, and he can't fuck me. l'm beginning to see clearly. Happy New Year! - Are you really a fag? - Are you seriously asking me that? - Yes, l'm really fucking serious. - What's wrong with you? Nothing, l'm fine. Are you OK? Yes, l am. Why? Well, fine then. Let's party! Let's put on some music, like Elton John... - You're going overboard, M?rk. - Am l going overboard? He hasn't said a word for 20 years, and l'm going overboard? - That's enough! l... - No! What's the matter? That you think l'm gay or that l didn't tell? You're supposed to be my best friend, but l have no idea who the hell you are. What do you mean? The same as he was. He's our friend. Except for a tiny detail, right Gabi? Something you forgot to mention. And why should l have mentioned it? We've had fucking showers together and slept together! Do you think anyone's interested in your dick? l had the right to know that you're a fag. l may have decided that it's OK, but l should've known. You may have decided? Do you hear yourself? - Do you understand what you're saying? - l think he does. He's been lying for 20 years and you don't care? l'm sorry then! l'm the homophobic and the faggot hater. They're the same. l'm also surprised, but just give him a break. Oh, was it a surprise? Anything else? Transgender surgery? - Blow me! - That's not going to happen anytime soon. - At least it's not with a woman. - Are you kidding me? ln a sense, he didn't question your relationship. He questioned himself. Maybe it's midlife crisis or lack of self-confidence. The real problem is not what he did, but the crisis he goes through. Lizi, the real problem is that this Marci is missing my husband's kisses. And how long has this been going on? Jesus! Can we talk about it at home? You received a message... How long? - lt's absurd, don't you see? - lt would explain things. - What would it explain? - Why you can't fuck me. - Just shut up! - You can't get a hard on, is it a secret? At least there's someone, who makes you hard. - Guys! - Great! l'm either gay or impotent. - l've got something to say. - You don't say a word! OK, we all got a little upset. Let's just get a drink and calm down. No. - We're leaving. - l'm not going anywhere. You really want to discuss it here? ls it better at home with the kids? Look, girls, daddy is gay. Your new mother is called Marci. Your mother might even like it. - You're drunk. - And you're a lying fag. l am going home, but you stay out of there. Give me the car keys. - You're in no state to drive. - l'll call a cab then. Here you go. All lines are busy at the moment, please, call again later. - Will you answer that stupid phone? - Let's stop this freaking game! No, let's play it all the way. Are you only tough with others' secrets? - l don't have any secrets. - Well, answer it then. Hi, Sanyi! Finally, hombre! l called you about 10 times yesterday. - l was working, sorry. - OK, did she like the ring? What? Oh, yes, very much. The dude says you may change it anytime again. - No, this one will be OK. - l thought you'd never make up your mind. l had to find the precious stone for the precious one. Alright, enough of the bullshit. l just wanted to wish you a Happy New Year. You too, and thanks for everything. No problem, hombre! Did she like the earrings, too? - Sorry, l'm at a party, l have to go. - OK, but did she like them, or not? Yes, she did. l thought so. lt's some cool stuff from Turkey, but... - Sorry, man, l got to go. l'll call you. - What? - Hello! - OK, bye! Who liked those earrings? You... will like them... l hope... Me? l've never had earrings. My ears aren't even pierced. What's this crap? What crap? l don't give a shit, if your ears are pierced or not. You'll have them pierced. Let's stop this stupid game before we all go nuts. A call from a buddy, and you get it all wrong. - Trashing me like that! - Niki? - Did you buy it for that Niki? - Are you crazy? Are you seeing her? Niki? She looks like she's swallowed a hanger. - Then whose damn earrings are they? - Yours. Aren't you going to answer it? lt's just M?ni. Then answer her call. l'm not going to, l don't work today. Fanni, give it to me! Give me that, you hear me? Don't you dare! l'm sorry, you told me not to call, but l'm totally bummed out. My period is late and l took a test. lt's positive! What the hell should l do? We need to talk! M?rk! You hear me?! M?rk! Are you there? M?rk! Fanni, open the door, please! l swear it happened only once, and l was drunk. Fanni! Fanni!! Fanni, l swear! Fanni, it's me, Aliz! M?rk isn't here. Let me in! Why did he do it? Tell me why? l don't know. l should have known. l felt it, when he looked at me... that l wasn't enough. Nobody is enough for him. But why this M?ni... An old woman like her... What the hell was she thinking? She knew very well that we're together. Well, at least now you know. And now l feel so fucking happy! What's up? Bathroom drama. Hi, mom! Happy New Year! Krist?f! P?l Koz?k, the neighbor. Your mother fell asleep on the couch. What should we do with her? l'll be right there, please, let her take a rest. Alright. By the way, the hamster has died. Then let her rest, too. lt'll take 20 minutes for the damn taxi. Where is Lizi? Who's Attila? - Nobody. - Nobody? A nobody is asking you if you're wearing any underwear? You misunderstand, l don't even know him. You don't know him? A stranger inquires about your underwear wearing habits. Some kind of market research? l've met him on Facebook. We just chat. - Chat? - Will you stop repeating my words? - And what else are you chatting about? - Nothing. lt's just a game. Sometimes we give stupid assignments to one another. Don't wear any panties? ls this an assignment? - Uh-huh. - And who's he? Some jerk from the office? l've told you, l don't know him. We've never met. - You want me to believe it? - Do what you want. - Fine, l'll call him. - Don't! - l'll just call him. - He has a family. He's texting about your pants, he isn't reading a bedtime story. Who's going to talk? You or me? Hello? Hello? - ls that you, Saci? - Hi! What a surprise! l didn't expect you to call. l was just curious about your voice. l see, me too. lt would be nice to meet. But you said we can't, we shouldn't make things complicated. That's what l said. But if you changed your mind, l'd be really happy. l keep thinking about you... Listen to me, you fucking jerk! lf you don't stay the fuck away from my wife, l'm going to cut your throat you hear me? He won't call again. l'll check on them, alright? What is it now?. - Are you happy now?. - After that? - At least he doesn't miss my kisses. - Not cheating, if it's over the phone? l didn't cheat on you! Chatting about your pants with some jerk is cheating. lt's even worse. At least cheaters take a risk. They may get caught and lose it all, or catch a disease. But fucking over the phone is for cowards. - Next time we'll get a room, then. - Good. Tell the kids what you're doing behind their back. You go first. lt hurts! - Are you wearing any underwear? - Stop it! l'm sure everybody wants to know. - Why are you doing it? - To know if you're a whore. l might as well just be, at least somebody would fuck me. Here we go again. l asked you if you were a whore. l've been trying to talk, but you didn't care. And now this Marci? - l told you not to go back to work. - What's that have to do with it? That you just fucking castrated me! You and your posh lawyers with their Porsches, Rolex watches and yachts. l have to wear a suit for a barbecue, but not just any suit. lf it wasn't 200 grand, you can't get in. And they go, Berry this, Berry that. l'm a chef, who works 12-hour shifts, but l just stand there like a moron. l can see it written on their face: ''What's this piece of shit got to do with her.'' - You've never said a word. - What's there to say? You and your ex, who plays golf in Africa. l wonder why l can't fuck you. You can't fuck me, because you're gay. lt's me. l am gay. This is my phone, and this one belongs to Gabi. Fucking great! ls there anything else you guys want to announce? Then you're? Then the photo with the woman bending over? Thanks for the evening! l've learned a lot. And, Gabi, just so you know. Are you gay? That's how it is. l'm gay. Or a faggot as you guys put it. Faggot, it's a pretty good word. Short, concise, and expressive. You can chant it: faggot, faggot! - Sounds good, right? - l can't believe this shit! Why didn't you tell us? lt took me some time to find out, and... l'll tell you why! l was gay for only 2 hours, but it was more than enough. We're all very open, aren't we? But if it's friends or family, it's not so cool anymore. What do you mean, you had the right to know?. He wouldn't be your friend anymore? ls it my fault? l didn't lie about being a fag.. homosexual. Faggot! Just go ahead and say it. Faggot! Or fairy, homo, turd burglar, pedophile. l've heard them all. Nobody said you were a pedophile. Really? l just couldn't take the kids for a trip. l couldn't lead a workshop, because the parents objected. - Did you get fired? - l quit. l didn't want to wait until they find an excuse. That's bullshit, you should sue them. Yeah, right. l didn't even dare to tell you. Do you think l'm ready to go public with it? But you could've told us. M?rk was right about that. l can't believe you didn't trust us. You don't lie to your friends about a thing like that. Really? You should've seen your faces, when Marci called. - At least we can meet him now. - Don't even dream about it! Why? Do you think we care if... l'm not worried about what you think about him, but about what he thinks about you. You lie to us about celebrating with your mother. You want to cheat on your wife. And you lie to everyone you meet. You pretend to be open-minded, but l know what's on your mind. A bunch of cowards, liars and hypocrites. Are we the hypocrites? You've been lying to us and the whole family. Dad figured it out. Why do you think he doesn't talk to me? What about me? How come you never told me? - l would've helped! - You? You're the biggest hypocrite of them all, sis. You preach about acceptance, but all you do is trying hard to satisfy dad, which will never work, by the way. You beg your husband to come back, and when he says no, you get him fired? Jesus... And l'm such a fool that l lie to Marci just to be with you. So l'm sorry, but l won't introduce Marci to you, because l love him. And if you love someone, you want to protect him. And l'll protect him... from you. And this piece of shit shouldn't be here! A stupa is actually a building, not a stupid pyramid. What's up with Fanni? Why doesn't she answer the phone? Fanni! Fanni, open the door! - Fanni, open it! - What is it? l don't know, l can't hear anything. Open the door! Let me do it! Fanni, please, open the door! lt's me, Aliz. - Do you have a key? - ln the keyhole inside. Jesus! Break the door! Fanni! - Fanni! Do you hear me? - Let me help. - Open the door, Fanni! - Alright, let me do it! Your mother called. l told her she was going to be a grandma. Don't introduce M?rta to them. Keep her to yourself! C'mon! Go after her! Fanni! Fanni! lt was heavy. lt was. Listen, D?me, l'm sorry! Happy New Year, Gabi! Bye! Bye! Well, l think that was it. Do you need anything else? No, thanks! Good night, then! Good night, Krist?f! What are you doing?! Do you know what M?rk calls them? Fuck pictures. There's one of each of his girls. He says they look the best right after. No, l don't think you should post it. And you shouldn't beg B?lint to come back. lt was the plan, really? Who gives a shit? B?lint is a jerk. He looked perfect, as if ordered from a catalogue, but he was still a jerk. Fuck anyone you like, get people fired, just talk to your daughter. She needs her mother. Her mother, Lizi! Not a bitter, cynical, arrogant woman. One more thing... l love you! Although right now l have no idea why, but l do. l've been waiting for years for the perfect moment, and it's obviously the worst, but l don't give a shit. At least l've kept my New Year's resolution for the first time. Although it's past midnight, so l fucked it up, too. Good night, Lizi! Happy New Year! Saci! Saci! What are you doing? You couldn't get a taxi? Get in the car, Saci. You don't want to walk all the way home, do you? Saci! Saci, you really want to freeze out here? Hi, darling! lt's me! lt's OK, if you don't want to see me. But just so you know, l'm on my way to you.
