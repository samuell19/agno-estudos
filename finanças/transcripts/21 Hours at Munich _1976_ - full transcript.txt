So the games of the 20th Olympiad... ...begin with the voices of children. Beautiful, innocent, serene. The setting much more Hansel and Gretel than Hitler and G?ring. The day is perfect here in Munich, Germany. Just nine miles and 30 years from Dachau. The Olympic Games designed to heal old wounds. To show history that men and nations can change for the better. Come on. Let's go. How are you? - Hello. - He's back. - Hey. - Hello. Hi. - Hello, Spitzer. - Just got in from Holland. - How's the wife? - Fine. She's still there with the baby. She'll be coming on in a few days. Why are you limping, Yossef? I ruptured my knee during the clean and jerk on the 430. I'm flying home for an operation tomorrow. Did you hear about Gaddie here? He placed 12th in freestyle wrestling. Twelfth out of 50. Maybe in four years, a medal in Montreal. Oh, yes. Go get some rest. - Good night. - Good night. Yes, Ankie. Yes. It's wonderful here, but I miss you terribly. Come two days earlier. Come two days earlier. Kiss Anouk for me. Moshe? Is that you? Arabs! Terrorists! Get out, buddy! Everybody, get out! - Don't shoot him. - Hands up. Help. Help us. Arabs with guns. Help us. Arabs with guns. 31 Connollystrasse. Come on. Keep going. Keep going! - You. Against the wall. - Send in their guide. Get over here, get over here. You too. You too. Put your hands up. None of your friends can hear you here. Now... ...if you lead me to the rest of your delegation... ...and announce yourself at the door, I will let you go. Where is Lalkin? Weinberger? Get up against the wall. Hands up. Help! Somebody! Better call the police. Any Israelis in there? Then who's in there? Uruguays. South Americans. How many Israelis in there? David. David. - Did you hear that? - What? Get up. Move. Hands on your head. Move. - Did you hear that? - Sounded like automatic fire. Go on! Hey! Stop! Go back. Schreiber. My God. How many hostages? Well, send a man over there and find out. Not from the Olympic Village. One of my men. Also, send 20 men and seal off all the access routes to Building 31. Surround it without the terrorists seeing you. You will tell your superiors that any attempt to interfere with our mission... ...will bring about the immediate liquidation of all Zionist prisoners. How do we know what prisoners you have? Dr. Schreiber, our men have surrounded Building 31... ...but the East German delegation refuses to move. Go over there. Remind them that they're in West Germany... ...and tell them to get out. - Right. "The revolutionary organization Black September... ...demands that by 9 a.m., the Israeli military regime... ...free 236 revolutionary prisoners... ...whose names are listed herewith." They're also asking Bonn for three long-distance planes... ...to carry them and their hostages to a country of their choice. "If the deadline is not met... ...the Zionist prisoners will be executed forthwith." The Olympics. Six years we have worked for this dream here in Munich... ...and now this. Mayor Troger, it's not just Munich. It's our whole country. Six million ghosts have come back to haunt us. Gentlemen... ...the problem is that we have several heavily armed men... ...holding as many as 10 hostages... ...in a highly populated area of the Olympic Village. They've already killed at least one man. And our job is to see that they kill no more. It seems to me that only the Israeli government can prevent that. Minister Merk... ...the crime is occurring here. It's our responsibility. It is obvious they picked the Olympics in order to draw maximum attention... ...to their political grievances over Palestine. This is the same organization that slaughtered all those people... ...at Lod Airport last May. The International Olympics Committee must be informed... ...of any decisions we make. - All right. Let's get them here. Brundage, Daume, all the others. But I'll tell you, the only way to defuse a situation like this... ...is to start talking to the terrorists right now. But who will talk to them? Well, at the moment, none of us. Not even a policeman, because the uniform... ...would put them on the defensive. I think it should be a member of the Olympic security forces. And preferably a woman. Now do you believe us? We'll kill them all. Starting at 9:00. And then we throw their bodies in the street. Do you understand? Hello. What do you think you're doing here? Come down. I want to talk to you. Yeah, that's right, you. - What do you want? - Don't point that thing at me. I have no gun. I mean, it might go off, you know, and then what? Who are you? Fr?ulein Graes, of the Women's Olympic Security Service. We have no women in here. Think you can charm your way in because you're a woman? Well, you're speaking to me, aren't you? There's nothing wrong in that, is there? How many hostages do you have? What are their names? What's the difference? - You know we have them. - Yeah. But Israel will want to know who they're bargaining for. I mean, maybe you've killed them already. No. We did not come here to shed blood. We came here to take them all alive. To show the world that the fedayeen are not cruel warriors. Our only mission is to free our comrades from Israeli jails. But this is not Israel. Your comrades are not here... ...and you don't have 236 hostages in there. You seek justice in numbers? What about the millions of Palestinians evicted by the Jews? But why bring your holy war here? The world cannot stay blind to the tragedy of Palestine... ...here at the Olympics. We've been dead and forgotten for years now. Well, you know, we can do nothing about freeing political prisoners... ...in another country. We can only transmit your terms. Why not give us conditions that are possible to meet? I have. Free them all if you don't want the hostages to die. Good day, fr?ulein. Move. This is still the Olympics, gentlemen. They've gone on for nearly 3000 years... ...and no petty political hoodlums are going to stop them now. I am placing all the security forces in the Village... ...under Dr. Schreiber's police command. And I am here to give the full support and aid of the federal government. Thank you, Minister Genscher. I need all the help I can get. You've contained those Arabs over on Connollystrasse? We have the building surrounded. We're still waiting word from Israel. Until then, we're only working with one hand. Just so long as it's a firm hand. Some gentlemen want to talk to you. Talk means nothing. You said you didn't want to kill. You didn't say you didn't want to talk. Who are they? Dr. Schreiber of the Munich police... ...Bavarian Interior Minister Merk and a gentleman from Egypt... ...a member of the International Olympic Committee. Okay. Stop right there. We haven't an answer for you yet. In 10 minutes, if I don't have an affirmative response... ...I will kill a hostage right where you're standing. Look. You've got to believe us. We are doing everything we can. To show our good faith, the three of us are willing, right now... ...to take the place of the hostages. You are not my enemies. Brother, Israel has just received the list. It is a very long list indeed. Be reasonable. Give them time to study it before you take any action. They have had already reasonable time. Now each hour will cost them one hostage. That's not reasonable. It's plain murder. If you do that, your hostages are no longer hostages. They're just people you were going to kill anyway. And the whole world will know it. - How much time? - Six hours. That's ridiculous. Five hours, then. Please. Three. Twelve o'clock noon, then. It's the prime minister. Madam Prime Minister. Yes. We've managed to extend the deadline... ...three more hours till 12:00 noon. Thank God for that. I'll do everything in my power to free the Israeli athletes. But may I suggest that... That you make some offer. A partial promise. For example, if they will free the hostages... ...Israel will agree to turn loose... ...a portion of the Arab prisoners in... In a few days. Mr. Chancellor, my position is a clear one. Israel will, under no conditions... ...make the slightest concession to terrorist blackmail. My government is completely behind me on this. These men are murderers. They have proven this over and over again. If we should give in... ...no Israeli anywhere in the world can feel safe. I am concerned only with the lives of the Israeli hostages in Munich... ...at this moment. Munich is a German city. The murder of Mr. Moshe Weinberger, and the taking hostage... ...of 10 athletes and officials... ...are domestic German crimes. I know that Germany would never abandon to terrorists... ...guests taken hostage in its territory. That is correct. But, please, I urge you to submit my suggestion... ...to your cabinet. I beg of you, Mr. Chancellor, do not abandon our children. Fr?ulein! Tell your friend Schreiber to get these men off the roofs... ...or I shoot a hostage. I give him 15 minutes. They have run into some telex trouble with Israel. Atmospheric conditions are very poor today. Well, let's hope for the sake of the hostages they quickly improve. How are the hostages? I'm only asking in case someone needs a doctor. No one needs a doctor any longer. Then there are more dead in there. Yes, one. Who is he? Tell me that much. Someone called Romano. A weightlifter. Why don't you stop all this killing? Look, we didn't mean to kill those two men, but we had no choice. We did not come here to kill anyone, especially Jews in Germany. - You know what the world will say. - They are saying it already. I just want to get my brothers out of jail. Your brothers? You mean, your comrades. No, two of my own brothers. In a word, the Israeli government is refusing to release... ...a single political prisoner. That is correct. Mr. Ambassador, do you know what this means? Unless the terrorists collapse... ...the only way to save your people now is by force. Are you willing to take that risk? Dr. Schreiber, what you plan to do now is entirely up to you. Dr. Schreiber would like to speak with you. Another last-minute appeal, Herr Doctor? Listen to me. Israel still hasn't had time to complete the files... ...on the 200 and some-odd... Then in nine minutes, we start shooting the hostages. - I asked you to listen... - Don't come any closer. If what you wanna do is murder Israelis... ...we can't do anything to stop you... ...any more than we can make a decision for another country. But have no illusions. If you kill them, we kill you. We are not afraid to die. In that case, you'll find us most obliging. Who is the new visitor? Mohammed Khadif of the Arab League. Paulo. Now, when we finish talk in good faith... ...I will return to the second floor where I've entrusted... ...the safety device of this weapon to my comrade. All right? Is that clear? We have not come here to trick you. We are all looking for a solution. There is only one solution: The liberation of all fedayeen prisoners... ...from the jails of occupied Palestine. You must understand. We are in the midst... ...of extremely delicate negotiations with Israel. Mohammed Khadif, have you, too, come to trick me? Brother, I speak to you as an Arab. I, too, wish to see our comrades released from Israeli prisons... ...but I don't want to see you hurt your own cause. Give the German more time to bargain with Israel for a final answer. Always more time. I give them an hour, they take two. I give them 20... They are doing everything they can. They don't want more Jews to die here. That's what will happen. And it will be on their heads... ...for all the world to see. - No, it will be on our heads. Show the world that we are human beings. You will never have a better opportunity. The West German authorities have authorized me... ...to offer you any amount of money you want... ...and safe conduct out of the country... ...if you will release the hostages. That kind of money would be very valuable to your organization. No, brother. You mean well, but why bother me with such useless proposals? We don't want money. And we don't want to hurt anyone. We just want to get our comrades out of jail. - And we are prepared to die for it. - Then give them the time to do it. Give them until 5:00 at least. They have given me their word that nothing will be tried against you. Otherwise, I would not have come. All right. But if by 5:00 Israel has not answered yes... ...to all our demands, the executions will begin punctually. No more talking. Suspend the games? For how long? Until the crisis is resolved, Mr. Brundage. Well, I wouldn't oppose a temporary suspension. As a policeman, I'm against cancellation for a very simple reason. Tens of thousands of people are attending these games... ...and if they're cancelled, most will descend on Connollystrasse... ...making my job next to impossible. I'll have to divert hundreds of police in order to keep the crowds back. May I suggest a temporary suspension toward the end of the afternoon... ...when there is a normal break in the games anyway. All right. But then... ...what do we do now? I think we keep talking and hope they make a mistake. Your two brothers in prison, when did you last see them? Two years ago. A family reunion. Your parents as well? Yes. They are separated now. But my mother still lives in Nazareth. But Nazareth, it is in Israel, no? Galilee. My mother is a Jew, as a matter of fact. Why do you look so surprised? You know, I was born in Nazareth... ...Iong before it was occupied by the Zionists. My father is Jordanian. What does he do? He's a merchant. He does very well. It's been a very good life. Always plenty of money, plenty of women. I've traveled and studied abroad. But all that means nothing now. There are five entrances to the apartment. The upper and lower windows, front and back. And the lobby door... ...which can be reached from underground and front. Minister Merk, a frontal assault like that would result in a massacre. We don't know how many hostages there are, where they are... ...or if they're together. And most frustrating, we don't know how many terrorists there are. What we do know is that they control an armed fortress. We've got to get inside and see where they are. Stop there. Put down the boxes. Now you can tell your policemen to go back and change their clothes. We can manage from here. - Who are they? - From the international youth camp. The radio broadcasts have been telling us for the last two hours... ...that Israel long ago rejected our demands... ...thereby sentencing their countrymen to death. Every radio station in the world is speculating as to what might happen. It doesn't matter. You've played around with us too long. We have decided to leave Germany with the hostages. In one hour, I want the three planes and crews... ...which we requested this morning. We shall fly to Egypt. When we land, we want to find waiting for us... ...at Cairo Airport every one of the prisoners... ...whose release we demanded. If they're not there, before leaving the plane... ...we will execute all the hostages. Without exception. A moment, please. What he is saying is that he does not wish to kill the hostages here. We certainly have no intention of letting them leave the country. Yes, but we can't let them know that. I warn you that trying to get three planes... ...in one hour is absolutely impossible. It will be hard enough to get one. All right. One will do. Good. But to find a long-range plane, service it, work out the transfer... ...all that could never be done in one hour. We would need at least three. Seven o'clock. No later. Just a minute. How do we know the Israelis are still alive? Before we fulfill our end of the bargain, I insist that we see them. Get a Jew. Bring him to the window. That one. Untie his legs. Come. Up! - Good day, gentlemen. - Good day, dear sir. I am Bruno Merk, minister of the interior... ...for the free state of Bavaria. I am Andre Spitzer... ...fencing master and coach of the Israeli Olympic team. We want you to know that we are doing everything humanly possible... ...to get you released. - I thank you, sir... ...in the name of all my comrades. - How many of you are still alive? - No, don't answer that. - Ask only what we agreed on. - Listen, you animal. No blackmail in the world can make us accept the word... ...of a single Israeli with a gun in his back. We're not doing a damn thing for you until we've seen every hostage alive. And what's more, we are not letting a single hostage go anywhere... ...unless he agrees to it. One moment. They're scared. They know Israel won't deal with them. They wanna get out of here. - Has Chancellor Brandt arrived yet? - He has just arrived in the Village. Go and transmit their new demands to him. All right. To show you our humanity and goodwill... ...I will grant this favor to only two of you. Dr. Schreiber and you, Mr. Genscher. Take off your coats. He doesn't like you very much. He might simply add us to his collection. Maybe. Maybe not. Gentlemen, I'm Manfred Schreiber of the Munich police... ...and this is Mr. Genscher of the federal government. - Hello. - Hello. You have all been told of the commander's decision... ...to fly all of you to Cairo? - Yes, we have. I want to make our position clear. We cannot allow this unless each and every one of you... ...agrees to leave the Olympic Village. Dr. Schreiber, whether we leave the Olympic Village or not... ...we know we are dead men. There are nine hostages. Altogether on the second floor rear bedroom. Could you identify their pictures? Yes. Was there a terrorist on the balcony when we were inside? No. He went in when you did. There was just the one outside with us. How many did you see inside? - Four, including the leader. - Then there are only five. I don't know. The doors to the back bedroom were closed downstairs... ...and then there's the front room upstairs. Might have been more. Herr Schreiber? General Zamir is here. - Manfred Schreiber, how do you do? - How do you do, sir? They say President Sadat has still not returned to the capital. Then tell them I wish to speak to Prime Minister Sedki. - David Marc Berger, the American. - American? Yeah, dual citizenship. He's engaged to an Israeli girl. He was badly beaten. He has a bandage on his shoulder. Ze'ev Friedman, our bambino weightlifter. - Yossef Gutfreund. - He's been beaten around the face. None of them complained. Eliezer Halfin, wrestler. This must be the dead one. I didn't see his face. Romano. Do you know that this big bruiser was a window dresser? He went out yesterday to look at the window displays in Munich. Young Mark Slavin. He only left Russia four months ago. Amitzur Shapira, our track coach. Kehat Shorr. Spitzer, of course. Yacov Springer. Poor Moshe. Excuse me. May I ask... ...Dr. Schreiber, what is preventing an immediate assault on Building 31? General, the latest demands have been telexed to Jerusalem. And Chancellor Brandt is still trying to get through to Cairo. Now whether these diplomatic efforts succeed or not... ...we're still going through with the plan to transfer the terrorists... ...and the nine hostages to the airport. You mean that you're going to...? We have no intention of letting them leave Germany. Good evening, Mr. Prime Minister. I can't hear you very clearly. I said, good evening, Mr. Prime Minister. To what do I owe the honor of this call? The perpetrators of the Connollystrasse attack... ...have announced they want to go to Cairo with their hostages, sir. The final ultimatum expires in... Heinz? In one hour and 40 minutes. We would be willing to let them go... ...if you will agree to intervene the moment the plane lands in Cairo... ...to ensure that the fedayeen do not kill the hostages. And that the plane will immediately be able to continue safely... ...on to Israel with the nine athletes. I do not believe your plan a valid solution. At any rate, it is unworkable. This is not an Egyptian matter. Mr. Prime Minister, I am asking you to join in a plan to save human lives. I fail to see how or why Egypt should be involved... ...in what is taking place in Munich. Because, sir, the fedayeen plan to fly to Egypt. Good night, Mr. Chancellor. The Riem Airport is too close to town. It's much too large to contain. They could take more hostages there, or even another plane. And we'd never convince the terrorists to make that short a helicopter trip. A helicopter? I don't wanna transport them by car or by bus... ...because they'd commandeer it right to the aircraft steps. I've got to get them to walk out in the open. F?rstenfeldbruck. Stand by your cars, please. You'll be getting instructions soon. All right? In my opinion, gentlemen... ...the longer you negotiate, the more important you make them feel. As long as we keep them talking, there will be no more killings. A blitzkrieg now would only lose more hostages. Some may die, yes, but others may be saved. Your parleying may end in having them all killed. Would you wait here, general? Is our plane ready? - It won't be ready before 8. - You said 7. The simple fact is we are having trouble getting a crew to volunteer. Have you heard from Israel? - Frankly, no. - I've had enough. I told you, we're not going to let you play around with us any longer! You can kill all of us right here, right now... ...that still won't get you your plane. We need a few more hours. At 9:00, I want two buses waiting for us... ...at the underground door to Building 31. You hear those people out there? They're just itching to get their hands on you. If we drove you out of here, a million of them would tear you apart. Come on, doctor. Riem is only 8 kilometers from here. If only you could give us a motorcycle escort. They'd brush aside the escort and hang you. Crowds are beginning to gather at Riem Airport. They are ready to fight with their bare hands to save the Israelis. Your German guilt runs deep. You, sir... ...you don't know the meaning of guilt. We're flying you to F?rstenfeldbruck by helicopter at 9:00. Have your hostages ready. We will have a controlled situation out here. The field is completely fenced in... ...to keep out crowds and prevent any escape. That's where the plane will be. A hundred police have already sealed off the base around the tower... ...and they're backed by 200 more around the fence. We've assembled two squads of motorized police... ...and six armored cars. And also a shock commando group of 23 men... ...with bulletproof vests, in case they're needed. Now, the first helicopter will land just about here. Herr Feldhaus is my deputy chief. He's in charge of the entire operation here at the airport. These men here, they are the finest marksmen in the Bavarian police. You mean they're not Bundeswehr soldiers? I can assure you, the Bundeswehr has no sharper eyes... ...nor steadier hands than our own Bavarian police. Here, let me show you the five sniping points we have selected. The other helicopter will go down right about there... ...forming a line with the 737... ...which will be standing approximately 80 meters away... ...right over there. There will be three marksmen up here. One down below and one behind the hut. That whole area down there will be too dark. We're putting in more lights. Don't worry, it will be as clear as day. Make sure. Excuse me, but why are there only five sniping positions? According to the number of known terrorists. But you can't be sure there are not more than five. You're right, general. We have nine other marksmen in reserve. What do you think, general? The layout here... ...disturbs me. Really disturbs me. I think the attack should take place in the Village... ...before the hostages even reach the helicopter. If it's possible... ...we'll try the Village first. Gentlemen, Cairo refuses to intervene. The terrorists promise to kill the hostages... ...if Israel refuses to negotiate. We must draw the line. An honorable nation does not get rid of its guests... ...by shipping them outside of its borders... ...tied up like packages of unregistered freight. Nor can we stand with arms crossed while our guests are murdered. I see no helicopters. The pilots couldn't land between these buildings. They're parked on the lawn outside of the administration building. - How do we get there? - We go through the underground. It comes up outside G1. - I want to see the route first. - All right, let's go. How long will it take? There and back? - Four minutes. - lf in four minutes I'm not back... ...my comrades will begin shooting hostages. One a minute. Now, don't hold me to that. I don't know how fast you walk or how many questions you might ask... ...or how many stops we might have to make for security reasons. How far is it? Through the underground, I'd say about 300 meters. Six minutes. Wait. The torch. You, that side. You, next to me. You, behind me. If anyone makes a false move, I will drop this grenade, understand? Why are they so far apart? Look, the Air Ministry requires that they be that far apart. That's all. You've already used three and a half minutes. Salah, it's okay. We are back. Tell Tony. The route is no good. I cannot see your men down here, Schreiber. I can smell them all over the place. So I have decided that we should go to the helicopters by bus. This is ridiculous. How long do you think you can go on? As long as I hold the hostages. I want a large bus here, in front of this door, in 15 minutes. Thirty minutes. All right, 30 minutes. But no booby traps. You must first give me your word... ...that no German citizen who aids in transportation from this building... ...to your final destination shall be in any way harmed or taken hostage. You have my word on that. Damn him. I already told you, no more deadlines. No, it's just me. I'm out of cigarettes. - I was thinking. - What? You say if Israel doesn't concede... ...you're going to kill the hostages. - Yes. Whether here or in Cairo, kill them nonetheless? Yes. Even if maybe you don't want to? Yes. You never would have done this unless you thought... ...there was a good chance Israel would negotiate. But now, you... You're dangling from your own ultimatum. What if you simply walked away from it? Just left, right now. They've promised you safe conduct. Listen to me. Millions of people are watching you right now. Watching you and me talking in front of this door. It's so crazy. They're afraid of you. They're afraid for you too. Imagine what the world would feel... ...if you suddenly spared those nine men in there. They're not only Israelis anymore, they're men. Sons and husbands, people we've come to know. Fr?ulein, you're asking me to show the world that I'm a coward. Is that it, then? They're going to die because of your vanity? It is vanity when you ask me to walk away... ...so the world will think I'm not a bad man after all. No. I'm asking you to stop the killing. I only want my brothers out of jail. I still believe we should hit them in the underground. That would have been fine until they asked for the bus. There will still be at least 10 meters between the bus and the metal door. Look, we agreed not to shoot... ...until at least half of the hostages were present. The others are almost certain to die. They will be killed anyway if you do not strike... ...at the first opportunity, getting on the bus. But certainly before getting on the helicopter. It is simply too great a risk to stage a shooting match... ...in front of the administration building. They would spray the area with automatic fire. That's the whole point of the airport ambush. They have to walk in the open. But you told me, sir... ...that you had serious doubts about the layout... ...about the lighting at F?rstenfeldbruck. I still have. But at least we've got a controlled situation. The bus is just arriving. Dr. Schreiber. I have a request. That I be allowed to go along with the Arabs and the hostages. Why? The man listens to me, you see. As long as I'm there, I don't think he will shoot anybody. There will be other Germans on that plane as well. Anneliese, the plane, if they ever get to it... ...will never get off the ground. Eight. My God, there are eight of them. We were right not to have tried anything during the transfer. Faster. Jan, call Deputy Feldhaus at F?rstenfeldbruck. Tell him the action is going to be there. Tell him I'm sending his men back... ...and that there are eight terrorists. Eight. Look up there. Closer. Close together. Captains Arbes and Vacano. When you land at F?rstenfeldbruck, open your doors... ...and get away from your copters as quickly as possible without running. But do not head for the 737. Understood? Roger. There are five of them. Five Arabs... ...out in the open. Not a chance. They're packed too close together. You are isolated out here, and so you men are on your own. If you can't find good positions for clear shots... ...get off the plane as fast as you can. They're going to cruise north before turning west. We'll head straight for F?rstenfeldbruck. We ought to beat them by about eight minutes, huh? God be with you. God be with you. - Did you get your men back? - Four minutes ago. They're all in position now. Where do you think you're taking us? We're supposed to be there by now. If this copter is not down in five minutes, I'm shooting one of you. Pirole Two, this is Pirole One, over. Pirole Two here. Go ahead. They're threatening us. They know we're circling. I'm heading straight to F?rstenfeldbruck, full speed. I'll call the tower. How's it going with you? Over. White hat here is getting real nervous. I was about to call you. Move it! Move it! We brought in all the lamps we could find. I've checked each position, all the men can see clearly. And I have eight armed men on the plane. But you can't do anything with only a few men 100 yards away. You've got to hit them from all sides at once. Get out in the open and fire at close range. - Where are the backup troops? - They're not yet here. The press leaked the word. All of Munich is on its way. There are huge bottlenecks on Routes 2 and 471. That's all we need. This is ridiculous. There isn't enough room. I mean, what can we do in here anyway? We're laying an ambush. Try to find a better position. There's no place to hide here. He's right, we can't do any good here. Let's get out of here and take positions outside. Turn out the lights. Halt! Get your hands up. What the hell are they doing? They are Arab terrorists. They are breaking their word. That makes 11 hostages. Thirteen. They're gonna check it out. Radio the cockpit, tell them two Arabs are coming aboard. Sir, there's no one on the plane. - What do you mean? - The men have left the plane, sir. For God's sakes, man, get down there and help the sharpshooters. Be ready with automatic fire when they get off that plane. Yes, sir. Who decides when to start shooting? Feldhaus. When he starts to shoot, the others follow suit. We've been tricked, comrade. Damn it. Fire when you're ready. Damn, he's still up! What the hell are we waiting for? Why don't we return the fire? Not while there are still hostages on those helicopters. There he goes again! Come on, come on! Come on. Where are those armored vehicles? How will you use armor in a situation like this? This is Manfred Schreiber. Throw down your weapons and surrender. I promise your lives will be spared. You're completely surrounded. There's no chance for escape. I repeat: Throw down your weapons and step out on the runway... ...with your hands on your heads. Out! Oh, my God. Eleven days ago, I declared the Olympic Games of 1972... ...to be opened. Yesterday, the abominable attack... ...on Connollystrasse shattered the serenity and saddened the world. Who bears the responsibility for this crime? First of all, the terrorist organization that thinks hatred and murder... ...can be methods of a political struggle. But in addition, there are countries that do not stop these men... ...from perpetrating such acts. The Olympic idea lives on. Our commitment to it is more powerful than ever. In the name of the German Federal Republic... ...I address this appeal to all the peoples of the world. Help us overcome hatred. Help us pave the way for reconciliation. Help us.
