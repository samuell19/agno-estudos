Ready? - Move a bit to your right. - Camera, set! Right a little bit, an inch to your right. - Okay, we're set? - Set. Ready. And action! Mom, I want Hot Wheels! Mom, I want Hot Wheels! Mom... I want Hot Wheels! Mom, I want Hot Wheels! Mom! Mom wants to go to the toilet, okay? Come here! Help mom! What are you doing? Come in! Yu Zhou, wait for mom! Be careful, hold here. Yu Zhou, wait! Wait for mom. Give that to my friend. I'm such a mess. - I'm so happy that you agreed to come. - It wasn't that difficult. The last time I saw him, he was only this tall. His grandma just had a knee surgery. And Juilliard is shooting in Japan. Wait a minute. Let me introduce you, this is Lee Yoon Moon. - Hi. - Hello. This is Yu Zhou, the Little Monster. Hi. This is my assistant, Cathy. Okay, just a second. Let's go. Wait, mom will get the bags. Let's go, Yu Zhou! So, what's the secret project this time? You must be tired. Let's talk about it tomorrow. When Miyamoto Musashi was old, a young swordsman came to challenge him. Faster, Mom! They agreed to fight at noon on a hilltop. But Musashi only appeared when the sun was setting. The young swordsman was furious. Musashi had his back to the sun, at the crucial moment of the duel, He moved so that the sunlight was shining right in the young man's eyes. And then... Killed him in an instant. That's so unfair. For the young man, a sword was everything. For Musashi, everything was a sword. The sun was a sword. Time was also a sword. So? Mom, catch it! So... When I was young, film was everything. Now I'm at this age, everything is film. Life itself is a film. Are we going to make a Hong Sang-Soo film? Let's make something fun. We're going to make an action film. No... Southeast Asian version of Bourne Identity. At the beginning of the film, on the South China Sea... a group of fishermen rescued a wounded woman. She had amnesia. She didn't know who she was or where she was. But she could speak many languages and had good combat skills. - You'll play this role. - What? It sounds really exciting. At least this time, I'm not playing a Burmese refugee or a Vietnamese bride. But I can't even handle a little kid now, you know? Let's take a look at where you'll be training. Didn't you say we're going to lunch? Let's check out the training place first. That's Master Loh. He's teaching Filipino martial arts. They learn long weapons first, then medium length and short weapons. Then finally barehanded. Hey! Who are you? Give it to me! Yu Zhou! - Gosh! - Sorry. - Master Loh! - Roger! So sorry. Take it back. Everybody, back to your drills. Yu Zhou, are you okay? Roger, kung fu actually takes time. Ten years of kung fu requires ten years of training. To make her look like she's got years of kung fu skills after a week's training, I'm afraid I can't help you. That's called "acting". I don't teach acting here. Then how about teaching her for a month? She'll learn as much as she can. She'll figure out the acting herself. How about showing me her skill at punching? Ah Hoong, get a pad. Ah Hoong, get her a skipping rope. Yu Zhou! - Give it to mom. Don't! - Master Loh, how about this? We'll start tomorrow. Let's discuss the training first? Okay, let's start tomorrow. She comes here at nine every morning. She'll learn whatever I teach for a month. You want me to train here for a month? Didn't you say that you want a change and get some fresh air? This is impossible. When I asked you to learn Burmese, hold your breath underwater for three minutes, learn pole dancing... You said that was impossible too. Why do you always underestimate yourself? That was a long time ago. Hey! He should be listening to you, not the other way around. How can you let him control your life? Stop it! I can play this role. Give me a body double for the action scenes. A body double? Think about the publicity. You, the award-winning actress, after your high-profile divorce, makes a comeback in an action film. After three months of martial arts training, completed all the action sequences without using a body double. Got it? Try to strike. Bring it back. One, right, strike, two. Bring it back. That's right. One more time. Stop. Come, face him. Now I want you to hit your target, which is his head. Don't strike when you don't have a target. Always have a target when you strike. Understood? I'm so sorry, Master Loh. When I was pregnant, walking on the street, some strangers would try to touch my belly. My belly. It seems that once you become a mother, your body belongs to society. It's strange. And what I hate the most is when people say, "Your child is your best work." I think I'm just a funnel for him to come into this world. But the kid grew from your body. Then I'm just a 3D printer, at most. Probably some genius wrote a program with only a few lines of code. - This one? - Yes. Okay. Mom is going to the gym now. You play with Cathy. Or you can watch TV, okay? Remind him to drink water. He forgets to drink. Okay, no problem. And if he gets hungry, you can give him this. But not now. And this one... - Don't let him take these himself. - Okay. And this window... He can open it. Don't let him climb up here and open it. Okay. Will you be okay? Okay, mom is going now. One, two, three. Good, let's strike faster. Try it. Okay, on your own now. Director Roger... I like your movies. Especially Bride Factory. It's superb! Where did you watch it? I studied in Kuala Lumpur. Sometimes, I watched movies at Kelab Seni Filem. That scene when Ah Noi ran away was so touching. It was her. Ah Noi? It was her in Ice Factory too. Hello? What? Okay, we're coming now. Moon! Moon, let's go! Yu Zhou is missing. I'm so sorry, Moon. He ran away while I was in the toilet. I'm so sorry! - Have you seen this kid? - No, I haven't seen him. Moon! Moon! Let's look at the beach. Moon! 20, 21, 22, 23... Yu Zhou. Where's Watermelon? That's Watermelon! Why did you stop? My mom's here. Shall we continue to play? - Your turn now. - Okay. One, two, three... Are you his mother? Yes, I am. How did he get here? I don't know. Twenty five, 26, 27... Try to grab his hand then hook his head. Moon, don't rush. Grab one hand first, and then close. Don't close your eyes. Open your eyes. Can you? You closed your eyes! Eighty nine... 90... Ninety one, 92, 93... Hey, hey... Who asked you to stop? Continue! Ninety four, 95, 96... Come on! 97, 98, 99... Look! You're telling yourself you can't do it. So you can't do it. If you tell yourself that you're going to kick 100 times, you can definitely do it. Understand? Where are you going? Now, do a side kick, 100 times. One! Two! Straighter! - Three! - Give it everything! Four! You need to do it faster! Six! Seven! Not you. Hold this. Be ready. One! Two... Remember this. I want you to kick at least this hard. - Yu Zhou. - Mom, look at this! A photo of Watermelon eating watermelon. Do you know how to call me? - I do. - You do? Okay. Call me now. - Hello. - Hello? - Who is this? - An alien. - Are you calling from space? - Yes. When will you visit Earth? Tomorrow. Tomorrow? Okay. When you're on Earth, you need to be careful. Because Earth is full of bad people. Okay? Okay! - Bye! - Bye! Did you call daddy? Why does it take you so long to write? Aren't you just copying from Bourne Identity? No, it's not a scene-by-scene copy. There are many problems to be solved. Such as? Like it doesn't make sense for you to work for the CIA. Maybe I can work for North Korea? Do you remember Kim Jong-Nam was killed at our airport? I could be a North Korean, and then pretend I grew up in Singapore. Use acting as a cover for my spying. I can speak many Southeast Asian languages. I could easily disguise myself as Thai, or Burmese, Vietnamese... You know I'm just teasing you, right? I know. But great ideas often come from stupid jokes. You need to be aware that there are no rules in real-life fighting. No time limits and no referee. The most important thing is to win. If you lose, you might lose your life. If you see someone with a weapon, don't fight with your bare hands. It's very dangerous. So today, we're going to learn how to use daily objects as weapons. For instance, this cup can be a weapon. I can use it to kill if I wanted to. Start now! Master Loh! Master Loh! Do you know where you're going? Ouch! No more pain! Okay. Let's fight! I don't understand. You have dated 20 or 30 guys in your life? Around that. None of them are alike. There was an IT geek, Mr. Malacca, a model, a writer, MMA fighter, a clown, an actor, a barista, politician, and a film director. I really liked every one of them. I like all kinds of people. Everyone shows me a different world. Not like you. You only dated one type of woman. Why did you marry Juilliard? Shouldn't you be asking, "Why did I divorce Juilliard?" No. I just want to know, what made you fall in love with him? What do you want? Nothing. I'm stuck with writing the love story part. Because this film is literally a love story. So troublesome. Do you still believe in love? I prefer friendship. My dream is to turn all my ex-lovers into my best friends. Friendship is precious. - Indeed. - Long live friendship! Your body is not the prison of your mind. The mind is the prison of your body. Is Juilliard the only star in Southeast Asia? We need him for the film. The producer wants him. He's a box-office guarantee. I'd rather quit than act with him. Please. Help me out. How am I going to play the love scenes? You know how much I hate him. Can you fall in love with him again? Forget the past. Pretend you just met him for the first time. That's just like asking me to eat what I just threw up. It's either him or me. Why does she hate Juilliard so much? It's the opposite. I think Moon still loves Juilliard. Trust your instinct. Feel your own body. Only then you can express yourself with your body. Master. What is my 'self'? Who got hit? Now, who feels the pain? Who asked you to block? Who asked you to duck? It's me. Now do you know what your 'self' is? Ah Ling! Robin called this morning. We just got a 30 million investment. That doesn't sound like bad news. The investment is from Lulu Huang. She wants to play the lead role. You need to know that... For me, you're... For me, you're the best actress ever. But the China producer wants Chinese actors... And you don't want to act with Juilliard. So now Juilliard is in, and I get kicked out? That's great. Great. You said you wrote this film for me. You said if Juilliard was in, then you'd be out. Why didn't you read my message? You're still the lead actress. I turned down the money from Lulu Huang. Damn it! It's not like I've never done low-budget films. It's too late. I'm leaving tonight. Are you kidding me? Ah Hoong, get me those two sticks. Take them, these are for you. Remember, the goal of learning kung fu, is to achieve self-awakening. Promise me three things. First, don't join any competitions. Second, don't fight on the streets. Third, don't let others know you learned kung fu. Yu Zhou! Give it to me! Mom, I want the water pistol! It's the same like hers. No. Let's go. We're going back tonight. If you keep behaving like this, mom is going to leave you here. Mom is leaving. Yu Zhou, come on! Yu Zhou. Come. Okay, I'm leaving. - Help! - Shut up! Hey! What's your problem? Where's my son? Where's my son? - Where's my son? - I don't know! - Where's my son? - I don't know! Mai! Just leave her. We don't want trouble. Maybe she got beaten up by the agent. Let's go! Is she dead? Just come on, let's go! Come on. Up. Get up! Three, four, five, six, seven, eight... Faster! My sister is coming, please wait for her! Go inside! My sister is coming, please wait for her! Quiet! Get in! Ten! Why are we still missing one person? Fuck! Why are you so slow? Faster! It's okay. Let him go. Go, go! Hey, you! Come here! You, come here! Quick! Quick! Get down! Come. You go in. Come over here. Wait here. Wait. Wake up! Wake up! Where's your identity card? - Where are you from? - I think she's from Burma. From Burma? Let go! Let go! Please take off your shoes. Phone repair? Please take off your shoes. Have you seen a Burmese woman? Phone repair? Have you seen a Burmese woman? You can buy a new phone here too. It's okay, never mind. They're gone. They're gone. YU ZHOU You have friends or family here? You have friends or family here? Are you Chinese? I don't know. Are you Thai? I don't know. I'm not. Damn it. Where is she from? I don't remember. I don't remember anything. You have a name? Mai. Adnan. This is strange. Either you're from a remote village that has no Internet, or you're a cautious person with no footprints on the Net. Someone has erased you from the Internet. - What does that mean? - Someone tried to erase your existence. Do you recall anything? Yu Zhou. Maybe... "Yu Zhou" is a code name for a mission that you were in. Why are you not married yet? What makes you think I'm not married? I prefer it this way. Just let this old fellow run the search. You want dinner? Don't be so paranoid. This place is safe. No, we're always in danger. Really? But you didn't kill me. Mai... What's this place? I don't know. I've learnt not to question the AI. It deals with big data at high speeds. There's no way for us to understand it. You just have to trust the results. Let's just go there! The moon is full Its light glimmers on the river Crocodiles emerge Thought to be driftwood Do not believe a man's sweet talk He will make promises but will not commit The moon is full Its light glimmers on the river Crocodiles emerge Thought to be driftwood Do not believe a man's sweet talk He will make promises but will not commit The car behind us has been following us for a while. Slow down. See if they overtake us. Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? Who am I? With a knife, they might attack in various ways. One... two... three. The third one is the most dangerous. If you can run, just run. If not? If not, you should use something to defend yourself. Something like this, a vase, a magazine. Or a pillow, like this, just block. - What if I don't have any of these? - If you don't... use the back of your arm. Don't ever use the front, because your veins are there. Protect your heart and liver. Most importantly, your kidney and back. If someone stabs here, you'll die within 30 seconds. I don't think anyone will stab me from the back. I'm more afraid of getting slapped. That's easy. Slap me. Just slap me. Really? Okay. Just like that. One, block. Two, arm drag. Three, choke. Hold here and put this behind the head. - Okay. - Try it. One... Two... Choke. Did I do that right? One more time. One... Two... Now you try. One... Two... Was that good? NO ENTRY Run! Why would someone do that? My picture. And my picture. Where are you going now? I need to find out who I am. I want to find out who you are. Does it hurt? Does it still hurt? Still hurts? What's wrong? Yu Zhou. Your memory is coming back? Yu Zhou is my son. And cut! Papa! Checking playback! What's this? You're still awake? - You okay, Juilliard? - Yes, I'm good. Director, we didn't have this now. Look. Juilliard was closer to Moon previously. And now Moon walks faster. Another take. Next! Go for another take, guys! Reset! The director said... Go, go, go... Yu Zhou, come, follow me. Can someone get Moon, over? At the top of the staircase, you'll see two dogs. Follow the dogs. They'll lead you to the Master. Thank you. Red pill or blue pill? It's so sour. It's not about your name. It's not about your job. It's not about your relationships. Who are you? Don't go any further. Come back! Cut! Don't touch your hair anymore. I'll flick your hands. You need to roll your sleeves down. A mistake, Director. Right here. Play! Can you fix it in post? No problem, small thing. One more. Wait, give me ten minutes. Don't walk past the platform we set up. It's not that long. Okay, I'm good. Good to go? - Good to go? - Okay. Okay, let's do it again. Standby. Ready, and action! - Okay! - End board! Yeah, it's good. You got it, 30 takes. - Got it? - Go Ahead. - So it's a wrap? - Yeah. All right guys, it's a wrap! It's a wrap! Thank you. The action loop has one actor to do all the... monster-type stuff. I think it's quick now, but before...
