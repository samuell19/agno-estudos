PHITSANULOK PROVINCE SOCIAL DANCE COMPETITION QUALIFICATION ROUND Hello. Hi, Nam, what's up? Sure. Okay, see you tomorrow. Bye. Damn! Not now! Lots of smoke like a barbecue party! Hello, Sir Featherlight. Sorry for bothering you. Can I borrow any bike with a super engine? RAJANOK POND PHITSANULOK PROVINCIAL ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION Well, Boong. I want to apologize. It was long ago but I never said it. I thought you'd get mad. Do you remember the last competition? It... It was my fault. I am sorry. I didn't mean to. Yeah, I know. Sir Featherlight told me. But I am glad you spoke directly to me. Nam. Please promise me, will you? If you have something to talk to me, will you always talk to me straight? My dad was so strict. I thought he never loved me. After his death, mom has been telling me how much he loved me. But finally, I don't feel it anyway. Okay, Boong. I promise. By the way, are you joining the competition? I don't know. I don't feel like moving now. I have lost inspiration. And I have lost my dance partner too. I can be your partner. Are you serious? Are you sure? On the mountain that day, my feet are still swollen, you kept stepping on them. Sure I can. Just for you. But... you have to teach me. Only because you were my student once. But the course fee is high. Is that all right? No problem. How about you? Here is the application form. I can pay the application fee for you. APPLICATION FORM FOR SOCIAL DANCE COMPETITION How is the mango? You don't need this paper, do you? -I want to wrap the skin. -Hey! Come on, mom. You know it's the application form. So what will you do? Tomorrow is the last day, isn't it? What should I do, mom? I don't have a partner. My partner... And my teacher is teaching him. Boong. Frankly, do you feel better... and want to dance again already? Social dance is not just about dancing correctly, but you have to enjoy it. When I won the competition, it was not only because of the practice, but I was happy dancing with your dad. How about you? Do you feel... No, I mean, are you happy to dance once again? This is so salty, mom. It might have been soaked in salt water for too long. Anything to fix again, Nam? Sort of, Uncle Chan. What is it? But it's not you who can help. -Damn it, Chan! -What's wrong, sir? Why didn't you tell me the engine was running? It burnt! Hey, why haven't you applied yet? Look. No. Over there! It's not only about having a partner. Mr. Featherlight strikes again! Hey, Boong. I will be your teacher. Because you are Roj's daughter. And Pim, your mother also asked for my help. All right. A friend in need is a friend in deed. Let's trust him, Boong. He is the number one dancer in Phitsanulok. Thou will see how good he is in a wink. You'd better not wink, man. Can you really do it? -You, moron! -Chan! Thou are so ignorant. He is so famous. Thou will see it soon. Please excuse thee, sir. How weird this guy is! Wait here. I'll show you. Ready? Now go! One, two, three. Go. One, two, three. Back. Forth. Forth, Forth, Arm. Forth, Forth, Arm. Back. Hey, hey, back. Go. How was it? Now let's get to the basic steps. There. Hang in there. Going to spin it now. Hey, hey, hey. Spin it. Spin it now. I guess the time is up, sir? Better rest. -Stupid Chan! -That's so cool! How was it? Social dance is something you won't forget once you master it. Just step correctly. Follow the music. And a little grace to your dance. -And one more thing. -What is it, sir? It's very important. It should be wavering like a leaf. Swing in and out, and then up. You are so damn cool, sir. Is it difficult to practice that? Social dance is not actually difficult. It needs practices. But more importantly, you need a partner. -I have one. -Who? Here. What are you talking about? You can only be a burden to her. You need to learn the basic first! Your partner should be that one. Thank you. This way, please. Thank you so much. Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. Wow, you look great and kind. Watch your step. Thank you. Take care. Hang in there, buddy. I'll find a good girl to ride you soon. You will not feel lonely. You haven't changed. Hey, I've got something for you. -Here. -What is it? Hope it helps. I got to go practice now.

I love it! -Why were you surprised? -Yeah. Why were you surprised? The ASEAN Economic Community or AEC will start soon. Make sure your project is deliberately planned. Because from now on, we will not have to communicate in our country, but we will deal with people all over ASEAN. Cappuccino with lots of foam. As usual. Thank you, Air. Could you help? Do you often come here? You seem to know her well. Yeah, I usually come here when I have nothing to do. By the way, how is your presentation going? Why are you drawing? Be careful, it won't finish. Nam. Have you ever been serious on anything? Any dream or target in your life? Without it, our life is worthless. Living from day to day. You should seriously think about it. If not for yourself, at least you should try to do something for others. Your life might be happier. Hey, what about the cake? You can eat it. I lost my appetite. Are you practicing for a dance party with any coyote? No, dad. I'm just exercising. It can't be fun dancing alone. Come on. I will be your couple. I will be your partner. -It will be fun. -Hey, dad. -It's embarrassing. -No need to be embarrassed. Social dance needs a partner. Just hold the hand like this, okay? What about this hand? Just grab it! -Dad. -Focus on the tempo. Watch the legs. Don't step on my feet. Step up, up, up Step up, up, up Step up, up, up Body wave, son. Body wave. Step up, up, up Here it goes. Step up, up, up Step up, up, up -How is it? -Wow! Dad, you are amazing! Like dirty dancing. Look at your hip! It's because of this hip power, you came in to this world, son. I will surely get that hip. Are you serious? That's cool. Come, come. Let's practice more. Hold this tight, got it? And for the full turn, when she steps forward, you step back. Step back. Yes, just like that. Back. Step up, up, up Step up, up, up You can also change like this. Step up, up, up Hey, son! Focus on the step or else you won't get better. Dad, seriously. -Are you really my biological father? -Hey! Why did you ask that? I see. I'll tell you what. You are my certified true copy. You have nothing like your mom. If your face looked like her, you wouldn't look this good. You would look like shit. Luckily you look like me. Your mom was so lucky she married me. Not that I'm boasting. But when I was young, I was a really hot guy. No girls could really resist me. I love you, dad. You're so cool. I love you too, son. Now, see if you can already dance. Let me see. Step up, up, up Wave it, wave it more. Left, right. There. Step up, up, up -Forward. Up, up, up -Dad, dad. It's very important here. Focus on this step, got it? Now, try it.

See? When your hearts become one, it gets so smooth. Beautiful. Yeah! Here's your water. Pakboong. Do you remember you once said people should have... a dream or a goal in life? Without it, our life is worthless. Living from day to day. Before... everyone including you said I was aimless... and useless. I don't blame them. Even I myself didn't know what to do with my life. What about now? I think I have my goal. Not too far from here. Thank you so much for making me realize I should do something for someone. You can also talk properly, but you never talk or do it. Especially when you are with me, you usually are shy and clumsy. Because... I don't know... how to behave when I'm with you. I... I might be like that before. But now... I am serious. Especially about the social dancing. Do you want to see for yourself, teacher? -Sure. -Come on. Nam, please be honest to me. Do you really enjoy social dance? I joined the club not to compete with anyone. I don't want to win anyone. But I just wanted to get close to you. Dance with you... in this room. Come on. Let's be partners. Just like... -a couple in love. -A couple in love. Pakboong. Have you ever heard this? Everyone is meant for someone. From now... we might not know where that someone is and if he or she really exists. But at least... you have your dance partner now. You're so much better now. Both dancing and talking. Because I started feeling like... we are a couple in love now. TO PAKBOONG LET'S GO TO THE ANNUAL FESTIVAL TOGETHER. NAMNAN Hey, hey, here he is. Get ready, guys. My son is here. Come on. Stand by. There's a secret in my heart I don't know how to start I don't want to shade the tears And so I can't get near Why didn't you just let me know It only brings you sorrow Here I will say it to you My love is so true It is a great love Only you will deserve My love is so true And it is only for you Hey, Priaw, it looks great. -Let's take a picture. -Come on. I can be the foreground. Come here. One, two, three. One more. One more. -Okay. -Wait, wait. -There's something in my eyes. -Let me see. Beautiful. So beautiful. Wow, beautiful red. You crazy. You don't have to say that. No, I am talking about the lamp behind. There. See? -On the street. -Are you looking for a problem? I was just kidding. -Let's go ride the bicycle. -Okay. -Could I sit like this? No? -Let's go. If I brought my bike, I would take you on a ride. Ah-Chang, would you like to know what am I praying for? What is it, Tamlung? Are you wishing for weight loss? Yes. No! Would you like to know? Are you crazy, Tamlung? You must be kidding. It's not good joking here. I say it in front of the Buddha image every day. Pakboong. Pakboong, I... It was almost the greatest night. I just wanted to say... It happened the other day. I kissed her on the boat. -What? -What? On the boat! That kind of thing would make her mad. Mr. Namnan, it was your first time dating her. Every girl should feel lost. Boong. On the boat! That kind of thing. First time! -Feel lost! -Feel lost! Hey, let's spread the news. Come on. Quick. Namnan got laid with Pakboong. Namnan got laid with Pakboong. Hello, Noi. Do you know Namnan already got laid with Pakboong? If it's the song you like, you will dance well. -Good morning, sir. -Hey. Hey, Nam. Good you are here. Let's practice. The big day is coming soon. Pakboong, I... -Please start the music. -Okay. Pakboong, I... Music! SOCIAL DANCE CLUB Boong. Hey, Nam. What's going on? Boong, listen. -That night I just wanted to say... -What? What did you want to say? I don't think you have anything to say. You just wanted to do what you want. If you've never done anything for others, then at least don't hurt anyone. Guys are all like this. Such a moron. -I am sorry. -Enough! What you did hurt me more than what they talked about me. That night I just wanted to say... that you are the reason I am here. What's up, son? Why do you looked so sad? A heart-broken stuff? I can't be wrong! You don't know how it's like to be young. You shouldn't underestimate me. I was young before. Do you think I was born this old? I was young like you before. You know who made me feel the way you feel now? It's your mom. Tell you what. Girls are all the same. Guys are all the same. Never mind them. Including dad too? No, not including. Not including Taew at the noodle shop. Who told you? Don't listen to rumors. Tell you what. I never want to seek any problem. Only your mom is painful enough. I don't want any more troubles. I don't know. But everyone at the market said so. They said you were drunk and hit on her. You should be careful, dad. Her son surely wants to kill you. Don't scare me. It's scary how the rumors spread so fast. I curse all of them. Love is such a difficult thing, dad. I gave up. It's also difficult to forget though. Nam. Look at the river. Love is just like a river. It makes us feel fresh and cool. When we drink it, we also feel fresh. But it never stays with us for too long. It flows. Comes and goes. You pour it on your head, it flows down on to the floor. Just like love. Don't get too attached to it and forget the whole world. TO PAKBOONG Hey, I heard your dance partner is so hot. She's mine. Leave her alone. -Shit. You must have slept with her. -You must have slept with her. -That's cool. -That's sure. -Hey, Dew. -I can control it. I've got something to talk with you. What did you say? Are you asking me to dance with Boong? Are you crazy? No way. I have got a new dance partner. But you know that Pakboong is so much better than her. And now Mr. Featherlight is the coach. I bet you don't want to lose. SOCIAL DANCE CLUB You will always repeat the mistake. Remember, when dancing, two hearts have to become one. That's important. Now you see, it's always like this if you dance with a wrong partner. Now, try again. Hey, can I talk with Pakboong? Are you tired? -A little. -Here's your water. -Thank you. -Welcome. Are you busy this evening? -Nope. Why? -Could you practice the dance with me? -Seriously? -Yeah. One. Two. One. Two. You pervert! -What are you doing? -Wait, wait, auntie. One, two, three, four, five, six... Is it you, Nam? I see, it's you who did this? Don't you know... Boong hardly wears this dress again. And why didn't you give it back to her yourself? I want to do so. But she's still mad with me. She wouldn't want to see me. Listen. My daughter likes honest guys. If you talk to her frankly, she can't be mad forever. Believe me. Can I also have the old one? Yes. Nam, what happened to your head? Boong, you need to focus more. I don't want to lose. I'll be right back. Okay. Next time you should order her coffee... with lots of foam. What the hell are you doing here? Please win the competition. It's her dream. Don't let her down. And at the end of the dance... relax your arm. Hold her gently... like you are a couple in love. NAN RIVER CRUISE Dad, I'm going to call mom tonight. Why? Don't you like the dress he gave you? If he's sincere, he should bring it himself. Not asking someone else to pass it to me. Like it's not worth his time. Why is it so hard for guys to express himself? And how do you know it's from him? What? You get mad again. Hey! Are you leaving now? Isn't it too soon, Nam? What about Boong? Did you tell her? Are you not going to the competition? It's the day after tomorrow. Yes, yes, please stay. We can't go support her at the competition. It's presentation day. Hey! This is so special, just because you're leaving. It's my favorite kid. -Just once in a lifetime, sir. -Sorry? -Thank you so much. -Sorry? -Thank you so much! -Hey! Could you just turn off the engine and talk? So noisy. -What were you saying? -Thank you so much, sir. Are you sure about this? Isn't it because of Boong? -Yes, it is. -What? I just want to say sorry to her. But I don't get a chance. At least, she made me realize that we should have a goal, a dream in our life. I should also have mine. But are you really sure about this? If we have made decision, we should do our best. Don't let anyone here down. By the way, let's try it. Now let's see how fast... you can reach your goal. Hey, wait. But I am a bike god. I don't want to take advantage. You can't beat me. If I start after you've gone 10 meters, it's too easy. So I will just start after you've gone 50 meters. How about that? -Just make it a fair game. -Sure. Put on your helmet. Ready? -Ready. -Come on! Ready? Go! Boong, don't make mistakes tomorrow. See you tomorrow. Dew. Don't you understand? It's the biggest chance in my life. I can't risk it. Your new partner is also good. I don't care. If you dance with Boong, I can't win anyway. You have to dance with me. It's over, okay? I'm going back home. Wait! Do you remember the night you guys were doing drugs at my house? I have it all in here. Mom! Have you seen my old dress? What dress? Did you search for it? Why don't you just go and get a new one? What are you looking for? Can I help? I could smell some dead rat yesterday. But couldn't find it. No wonder. It's so smelly here. I searched everywhere but couldn't find it. It stinks too bad. Mom. Boong, this is the first dress you wore to dance. It was on the Children's Day long ago. I don't remember. But why does it look so wasted. Lots of stains too. Let me see. It's so nice and colorful. Oh, my beloved son You are leaving today Going so far away I wish you safe journey Come back to me soon Please come back to me Dad, please. Son, don't leave me for too long. I'll miss you.
