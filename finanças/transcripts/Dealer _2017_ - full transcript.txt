Are you confused about any of this, Kelly? - Uhh... - Or just think about... three simple words. Deal, or die. Hey, Kelly, what's your favorite color? Color? Yeah, in stressful situations it's good to think of a color and focus on it. You might have to do that today it's something somebody taught me when I got started. Yeah, uhh... why are you doing this? Why am I doing this? Why don't you have better fucking questions? Oh, and by the way, you will be watched tonight, so... You know, don't fuck up. You think of that favorite color of you, Kelly. No, I'm... No, uhh... I'm drawing a blank, sir. Sir? Call me X. But don't worry about it, that color will come to you. Good luck today, buddy. Now hand the phone back to Trevor. No, I'm still here. Yeah. Well, I've had kind of a day. Look, I tried, uhh... All right. OK. Will you please be a drug dealer for me? I'm gonna text you four addresses. I need you to go to each one of those places and drop off a package. Packages are downstairs in my duffel bag. I've labeled them one through four so you don't get confused. - Hey Kelly. - Hey. - You got a second? - I really don't, I'm sorry. Cool. I just wanted to make sure that your trash can was a little closer to your house because, they only give us the two cans... Yeah, stressed day tomorrow, right? What do we need? You got it all. I'll make sure. Let's go. The fees will get higher and it's like ten dollars. Well, whatever the fees are, I'll pay you back. It's gonna be... it's a lot of money. It's OK. Oh. Oh god. Not my problem. Oh shit. No, no, no. It moved. Give it to me, give me the box. Hi. Hi. Uhh... I... are you expecting, like, a package or delivery today? Oh, are you the blood guy? No. I think it's just pot. OK. - Oh, uhh, is it free? - Uhh... Well... Not free. No, not free. - You're supposed to honk? - Yeah. - Honked. - Wait, is Trevor sick? Trevor is stabbed. Oh my... Oh my god, dude. - Uhh... - Is he OK? - He's fine. He's fine. - Oh. Yeah. Here, just come in for a second. No, Miss... I'd prefer to do it out here, if we could just - do this out here. - In the front yard? Come on. Do you have money for this so I can get going? I bet you want to listen to the music. Oh, you don't wanna listen to music? OK. This doesn't look like an eighth. I don't know what you two had one time. Well. We worked out an eighth. An eight? Well, you just pay me for whatever you can buy. I can't just pay you for this. No. No, no. Uhh, did he give you any more? Uhh... I... Need some help? No, I got it. An eighth is like eight handfuls. Yeah, I, I know. So do you have anywhere I can put all this? Dude. I'm, I'm kidding. - What? - That's not, that's not funny. You know, if I screw this up I'd get stabbed. Yeah, you're definitely gonna get stabbed for that. Did Trevor not give you a scale or anything? No. No. Oh. I didn't even know Trevor was a drug dealer until tonight. I mean, I, you know... I don't know how he expected me to know all this, I mean, I'm just a dealer. You know, like blackjack and - poker and- - Oh, you're a poker dealer? That kinda sounds like a fun job. Yeah. I mean, I hate it. Maybe it's just not on the cards for you. Really? That's a good... pun. Yeah. I'm a bit of a wild card. That's, that's a good one, too. Are we, are we almost done here? Not if you play your cards right. Do you have a girlfriend? Uhh, probably. - What? - Mm, what? What? What? Oh, umm, yeah, yes. I do, umm, I do not, have one at this time. Oh. - Uhh, do you have like a-- - Oh! Shit. Just take your pants off. Your clothes will be dry in, like, twenty minutes. OK. I just hate that I can't go a day without spilling something on myself. You hate a lot of things, huh? Umm... - No, I just- - Can you throw me that pillow? Sure. I just have bad luck, that's all. Well maybe that's all you're keeping track of. Come here. Down there? Yeah. Fill that in. - Dude. - Hmm? Come on. - What? - You would. Look how uneven this is. I just started. Yeah, it was very telling. Throw that away for ever and... Now you're left with that. And what do I do with this? You get super-stoked on life. It worked for me. Is that the only reason you got stoked on life? What's that supposed to mean? Nothing. Whoah, what is that? It just, like filters out the smell, you know? I don't want it to smell like weed out there. Uhh, I don't really think it's working. I mean, are you just putting it at the wall? Do you have roommates who don't like smoke, is that why... Uhh, my roommate's my dad. Your, roommate is your dad. Yeah, just for like, now, you know, and until I get my feet back on the ground. I was dating this Romanian guy for a second, and he got me on some hard stuff, and I try to heal myself and blah, blah, blah, and and my dad freaked out and he locked me up in this place. Uhh, is your dad cool with you smoking? - No. - Great. OK. I kinda knew that. Umm, so... Uhh... I should probably get going, that's the thing. You know what, these are your shorts, aren't they? You gave me your dad's shorts, that's funny. Where's my pants? I need to get my pants right now. It's OK, he's not gonna be home for a while. I don't... What was that? What was that? Uhh... Uhh, I gotta hide. I can't fit under your bed. What, then? Just, uhh, hide in the closet. Hide in the closet? That's where everybody looks. Ollie? Uhh, just a second. Uhh... Ollie, I want to ask you... Hey, Dad! What's up? You smoking pot? What? Where is it? Dad! Come on. No. It's, it's incense. It's a new scent. That you never smelled before. Dammit, Ollie, I know what weed smells like. Where is it? Umm... You're not gonna find it. Because there isn't any. Anywhere. Especially not in the closet, Dad. Sorry, Kelly. - What? - What? You said, Kelly. Uhh, I did? You don't know what you said? That's weird, Dad. - Why would I say that? - I don't know. What are you talking about? Who's Kelly? What? Who's Kelly? Does Kelly even know who he is? You know what? I have some friends coming over. Just air out the room, OK? And keep the door shut. We're not done with this. Dad, it was just incense. What the hell? Jake, get out of here. OK. Is he gonna tell your dad that I'm in here? Probably not. He doesn't really talk that much. OK. All right. Uhh... I'm going to jail. Umm... I need to find a way out of here. Hey. Help. Help me. Help. Calm down, dude. What? Don't tell me to calm down. Don't tell me to calm down right now. How the hell do I get out of this house? I have an idea. Go out the window. Duh. You're high. Whatever. I do it all the time. You just go. - You jump out the window? - Come on. Don't... You jump out the window all the time? Yeah. Just, just clear the bush. What's the part that happens after that? Umm... you... get up and then you go to the party. Are you OK? I'm wonderful, thank you. - Hey. - Come on in. - Hi, officer. - Hi. I know you're not on duty right now, officer, but I... I just saw some suspicious-looking characters looked like they were breaking into a house in the neighborhood, and I thought I'd - bring it to your attention. - OK, umm... - Where? - Uhh... I mean, uhh, like, not across the street, down the road... - Show me. - Ah... Well, they came in from over that way and then they drove over here and then, uhh, and then, you know and the thing is, uhh... I don't really want to... I don't want to get involved - you know? - You don't wanna get involved but you've already gotten yourself involved so just tell me which house. Well, uhh, you see, you see, like way down there past that, uhh, power box. - Right. - Yeah, well, it's the driver does a left of that and, umm... There's no car there in the driveway. No. Well, it left, it left. But before it left... How long were you out there watching this? But that's the thing. I had to pay attention to make sure it was real. That's why I came to you after I established, yes, this is real. 'Cause you're a detective. I just, you know, it's a... Good Samaritan? Community watch, uhh, community watch. Community watch. - OK. - Uhuh. I've never seen you at the meetings before. Well, I do diligence, and I work nights. All right. OK, well, why don't you just head back home and I'll take a look at it. Please do, 'cause it's still, I mean they just made their way in. - All right. - Please do. Go on right there by the power box. And I could have swore something was like but you know, I don't know. So - All right. - Uhuh. I think we got a problem down the street. Why didn't you tell them? Thank you. Did you want something? Just checking. Everything good? Yeah. Bathroom. I'm looking for the bathroom. Oh. Uhh... Bathroom. That's done. No man, that's a closet. - After you. - Thank you. Hey. I need your help. OK? I need to get out of here. I know you don't know me. I don't know you. But can you help me? Wow. Wow. Wow. Put that... I don't want, I don't want it. No. I just need you to cause a distraction. OK? Can you do that? - The kid shot the refrigerator. - Is everybody OK? Hi. Hi. Uhh, I need to leave. I need to go. Thanks. Hey. Hi. Your front tire looks bad. What? Your front tire, I think is a little wobbly, it's... Looks dangerous. Just worried about you. Just worry about yourself, OK? Oh, and now you're rolling the window up. Lot of rude rolling going on over there. - Hi. - Hi. Uhh, do you have a restroom? You need some rest? Umm, well, umm, I don't know. I just need to wash my hands. - It's right around the corner. - Thanks. Don't fall asleep in there. - All yours. - The window. - Hey! - Whoah! What are you doing? - I'm in here. - I'm sorry. This is a single bathroom. Did you not see that? - I didn't see you at all. - What's wrong with you? I just assumed no one was in there. - There was a guy in here. - Just get out. Why are you trying to understand? - I'm sorry. - Now find your own... Out! Excuse me. Umm... Did you see like a big guy coming out the bathroom I was just in? I mean, uhh, he just... It's not important. Do you have any coffee? Did I see you pull up on a donut? Umm... oh. Spare tire. Yeah, I have a red flag. You're buying a donut? I don't think the two are related, but yeah. Are you sure about that? - I think so. - Two, ninety-five. Oh. This one has soot on it, just like you. - What? - On the nickel. Oh. Right. - Yeah. You know that it costs 11.2 cents to manufacture a nickel? No. Is that true? It doesn't make any sense. Oh yeah? That's pretty fucked up. Yeah. Have a nice day. OK. Shit. Makes no sense. But it does make a nickel actually makes five cents. See, that's the joke... the argument. It makes no sense, it actually makes five cents, makes... it's like a nickel, and you'd find that really funny. Fall in love with me and we could go home together and probably get married, have two kids, that'd be great. Saw everything. Everything? Yeah, you thought that you spilled jelly donut filling on your pants? You didn't. But you looking actually caused you to spill the donut filling on your pants. It landed in the exact spot I thought it did, when it didn't. Yeah. Here's the bad news. Uhh... That was the boss' favorite statue. It's a Buddha. Well, it was a Buddha. Represents peace. Now it represents pieces. I'm sorry. Am I in trouble? Let me tell you a true story about the boss. So one time the boss was driving, and he got into one of those situations where he was making a U-turn on a green arrow and there was some guy making a right on a red. Follow me? And they almost hit each other. And this guy turning right is like freaking out, he's like, swearing and all that you know? Road rage. So he decided to follow the guy home at a distance, obviously. When he gets to the guy's house uhh, he notices that he has a boat in his driveway. So the boss leaves comes back in the middle of the night and he puts a tracking device on the guy's boat. Like a year goes by. One day I get a little, beep-beep you know, on my phone and, I check it and guess what, it's this guy. He's taking his boat out to the lake. So I told the boss and we decided to take a little trip out to the lake ourselves. We rented two jet-skis and we cruised around, looking for the guy. We found him out in the middle of the lake. And, pardon my pun here, but it's one of my favorite parts of the story but when the coast was clear we, uhh we rode up on the boat umm and we just started shooting. The pina colada song was playing on the boat's radio I remember, and the boss the boss was singing along. Killed his, killed his whole family. Then we cruised around on the jet-skis for a while just for fun, you know, jet-skis are great. Umm, and we came home, here... and we watched a movie and shared a popcorn. It was, it was the perfect time. You have really pretty eyes. Thanks. Don't you have anything you want to say about my eyes? You... also have pretty eyes. Thank you. OK. Can I ask you a question, and be honest. Did you put this statue here, because I'm pretty sure when I rolled up, it wasn't here. Getting all tense on me? - No. - All these questions. Let me ask you a question. Know any jokes? - Do I know any jokes? - Yeah, man. Jokes. To relieve the tension. OK. Umm... Yeah, uhh... What did one grizzly say to another grizzly holding a gun on him? Oh, what? What's the matter? Afraid to fight me with your bare hands? I like that. You, you calling me a chicken, man? No, no. No chicken, man, in that joke, just bears. That was a second joke. Legit. OK. This is gonna happen. I'm gonna go get the chicken mask, and put it on and come back out here, and fight with our bare hands. If I win, nothing. You deliver your package, nothing happens. Boring. Uhh, but if you win I will grant you one wish. - Deal? - Look. You're not a genie. And I am not gonna fist-fight you, OK? Or anyone, really. It's not my thing, it's not what I like to do. So, no. No. OK, here's the thing, though. If you don't say it's a deal, I'm gonna shoot you. I'm gonna shoot you right in your your body, right in the main mass part of your body. Just say it's a deal. OK. Deal. Stay put. I'll be right back with the chicken mask. You gonna run? Give me your car keys. - No, I wasn't going to run. - Give me your car keys, man. - Give me the keys! - All right. Thank you. Oh. Great catch. Did you think it was a good catch? - It was a terrific catch. - Thank you. Don't run. I will chase you in your own car. OK, so, just to clarify the rules. Umm, I was only going to kill you for not taking the deal. I'm not gonna kill you if you lose this fight. Yeah. OK, good. I'm only being so specific because I don't want you to think that you're fighting for your life. Because that will give you an unfair advantage. The stakes would be so high that you'd move. But to clarify, we're only fighting for the win. - OK. - Come right here. Cooler place. This is dangerous if you do that. So. What's this? - I was... trying to... fight. - With a fist. Bare hands. Looks like a cat. Down. Keep your thumbs in. And, go! Shit, shit. All right, uncle. Uncle! Shit. You know the rules of uncle? Goddammit. I didn't... Couldn't see a goddamned thing through the chicken mask. - Well, yeah. - OK. Legit. What's your wish? Well, I wish you wouldn't tell your boss about the statue. Granted. Grab your package, let's take it to him. I couldn't see at all. And I know I made the rules, but it wasn't totally fair. Deja vu, right? No, I've never seen that statue before. Wait here. OK, we're good. I told him it wasn't you. Wait. What? Did you actually tell him it wasn't me? Or did you just, not tell him it was me? Wait. Yeah. No, I told him. My wish was for you to not tell him that it was me. Not to specifically tell him that it wasn't me. What's the difference? The difference is he has no idea who did it instead of knowing exactly who did it. - Umm... Oh... shit. - Yeah. - You're right. - OK. - Busted. - Uhuh. I guess I still owe you a wish. Great. I can get a lot of use out of that. All right, let's go in. Sorry. Shit. Are you the guy that didn't break the statue? Yes, sir. That's me. Then what did you do? I delivered this, package. Oh. Sit down. Where's the normal guy? Uhh, I'm just, filling in for him. Did you say, filling in, as a joke, because you saw me spill donut filling on my floor? I don't think so. I mean, I don't... really know any more. I, uhh... No. I'm pretty sure, I don't think so. If I call Mr. X right now, is he gonna write me a check for $940 to pay for the broken statue? Or is he gonna tell me to shoot you in the stomach with a bow and arrow? Wow. I don't think he's going to say any of those things because they're so specific. I'm thinking he'll probably tell you I'm just filling in for the normal guy so like a third thing. But I'm not looking for a normal guy. I'm looking for someone special. Are you special? I'm not special, OK? I can guarantee that. Everyone thinks they're special. You don't. - That makes you special. - Mmm, so true. This guy, this guy's legit, sir. He just kicked my ass outside in the chicken mask. And he also came up with a really great joke like, on the spot, that had to do with the situation, in a second. Even more situational jokes slightly less funny, but even more situational. Totally relieved the tension. Relieved the tension, huh? Think we need to take him with us today? Well, there definitely might be some tension. Definitely, maybe. No, you know, I... Guys, umm... I'm... I was just here to drop this package off and then I, I've got to get going. Why? Are you some kind of chicken, man? Son? You don't look like a guy that's afraid to get his hands a little bit dirty. Are you saying that because I have some sort of twinkle in my eye? Or because I actually have dirty hands? This guy's legit. I know you broke the statue. What's-his-name says you didn't do it but obviously that means you did. I mean, I didn't even know we had any statues on this property, but if you broke it then you are legit, which What' s-his-name says you are then I'm forced to force you to follow the rules so you don't lose your legitimacy and get murdered by us! Let's go get our hands dirty. Deja vu, right? Because it's home-made? This is, uhh, Saint Francis. He loved birds, I guess. You love anything enough you'd wanna put it on a statue with you? Well, not that I can think of. Do you? Of course. Mind if we took your car? I'd prefer if we didn't. I'm driving on a donut, a spare tire, and... they actually tell you not to drive on those things for too long. In the old days wild west days they had such a problem with horse thieves they had to make the punishment death. I mean a lot worse crimes have lighter punishments, but rules were rules. They had to take a stand. OK, here we go. You were wrong back there. It was you who is angry at me. But you were the one who was wrong. I had a green arrow. I was in a lane where a U-turn is legit. - Totally legit. - You were making a right on red. But you honked at me. You made an obscene gesture. What do you have to say about these things? I'm sorry. I didn't know. No need to apologize. Everything you did made sense. You were acting naturally. Anger is natural. Unfortunately you didn't follow the rules, and me and What' s-his-name here, we are strict on rules. We don't care if you make sense or if the rules make sense. All that matters is once we establish the rules you don't break them. And you did which makes you very un-legit. Look, you don't know-- Ohh. I know. ♪ We love the sun ♪ ♪ At sundown ♪ ♪ Sundown ♪ ♪ Sun hits my eyes ♪ ♪ Surprise ♪ ♪ How good it feels ♪ ♪ In a burning sundown ♪ ♪ For us to drop in sundown ♪ ♪ Sleepy sun in sundown ♪ ♪ Mourn for molten sundown ♪ ♪ In a burning sundown ♪ ♪ For us to drop in sundown ♪ ♪ Sleepy sun in sundown ♪ ♪ You love the sun at sundown ♪ So how're you gonna feel when we get out there and then the pina colada song's playing on the boat's radio? Terrible. Can I ask you a question? And be honest. Are you gonna are you gonna kill me when you get done killing all of them? Well, look, let me ask you a question. Would it be the perfect crime if we let you live after this? No. Sorry, man. I, I wish I wish that you'd kill your boss instead of me. We've still got a wish. Yeah. You do. Agreed. - What's this now? - I owe him a wish. And he just wished for me to kill you instead of him. Shit. - It was legit? - Yeah, it was fair and square. We had a deal. A deal with the dealer. Well. If it's all right with you I'd like my last word to be the f-word. OK. Been a good life. Lot of beautiful women. I had running water the whole time. Pizza. Burritos. Ice-cream whenever I wanted. Even the Pharaohs didn't have ice-cream. You know where the money is. You have my blessings to take it all. I just have one request. Take a little bit of it. Build a statue of me eating ice-cream. It would be my great pleasure, sir. Well, What's-his-name it's been legit as fuck. You're worried I'm gonna kill you now? Yes. No. You're covered because you said instead of me, in your wish. OK, good. So we can go home then? You don't have to kill a family, we just-- Well, no. That we have to vote on. We have to vote on whether or not to kill the family? - Yeah. - I vote no. Oh. Well... I vote yes. So I guess it's gonna be a coin flip. You got, you got a coin? - I got, uhh... - I saw you put one in that little bag of you with the wallet and your phone. Yeah. I got, I got a nickel. Perfect. All right. Heads we kill that small family. Tails, we head back. Oh, actually heads should be head back, because it's the same word. Head. So heads is head back and tails, we kill the small family. Flip it. Uhh... You have to flip the nickel. Don't try to drop it or cheat or something. You're covered for the wish but I'll still kill you for being elegit - if you try to cheat me. - Yeah, I, I... I, I was just thinking that, uhh, you said that heads means heads back. Well... backside heads, tails of tails is heads back, literally. Holy shit, I love that. OK, definitely. Tails is heads back, literally and figuratively. Or maybe they're both literal. Either way definitely, tails is head back. Flip it. Did you know that it it costs 11.2 cents to make a nickel? Wait. What? Is that true? That's terrible. That makes no sense. Well, it might not make any cents but it does, it does make five. Holy shit. - That is incredible! - Yeah. - That is such a good joke. - Yeah. And related to the situation so much. - Uhuh. - Hey, do you keep stalling with clever word play because you're trying to relieve the tension - and save that small family? - Absolutely. Wow. That's legit. You know what? I gotta reward that kind of behavior. Granted. What? Yeah, I changed my vote. - I vote no. - You vote no. I vote no. You just saved that small family. You just saved them. That's great, man. That's great. That's... I vote no. Can I ask you a question? Would that pina colada song really be playing on that boat if we went over there? Can I ask you a question? Yeah. Shall we cruise around on these jet-skis for a while, just for fun? Well. I'll always remember What's-his-name. Isn't that you? Not anymore. See you around. What the fuck are you doing? - I... - Why, what is this? - I just came to... - You're not Patrick. - I'm Kelly, Trevor's friend. - You don't look like Patrick. No, look, I've got the wrong-- Oh! Do you fix... Do, do what? Oh. Oh, Trevor, my ass. Is that my box? Uhh... - Yeah. - Come in. - Yes, come in. - Uhh... Come on. I gotta go soon, though, you know and... - so... - So. - Have you been here before? - Uhh... - To this hotel? - Yes. No, I haven't. This is a good place for this, right?

I'll give you another 500 dollars. - 500 dollars, huh? Really? - If that is your price. Uhh, I don't, I don't even know what it is.

You know, I've actually never done anything like this before. Yeah. She's gonna, she's gonna do it too? Yeah, we all do it. This is a very special night. OK. Jesus, that... - that burned. - Oh, yes. The burn. - So how long does the...? - Huh? - How long does this take to...? - Fifteen minutes. No, no. Not how long we're gonna... How long is it when, uhh... Disrespectful. Look. What the fuck is that? It is an eel. What does it do? What the fuck is it doing in here? It is alive. Oh no, no. Listen. Listen to me. We need to get out of here. We need to take it to the room... There is a man... He will pay you. - He will pay you. - Oh god! Shhh! Wait. Wait. They know it's here. Who? Who? They want it. They will kill us for it. Who's gonna fucking kill me? Wait. We need to... We need to get the hell out of here... Why did you tell me to... Do you want to fucking die? He needs to go! Now! All right. You grab his face. - You grab his face. - What? - Ooh. - Shit. Wait, wait. OK, OK. Now I'm gonna run ahead... And then you come out from the back and we go to... No, no, no! Wait. Wait. Where'd he go? What are you doing? That eel is property of the hotel. You can't take the eel. I don't know what's going on. You come over here right now and you leave that eel on this desk. I'm sorry. I can't. I'll call the police, then. Uhh... all right. OK, OK, OK. All right. All right. Oh! - Where the fuck is the eel? - Huh? - He said-- - Who said-- The hotel clerk said... What the fuck are you talking about? The hotel clerk, he said it was hotel property. You gave him my eel. - He said-- - You gave him my eel! I did. He said he was calling the police. - Uhh, uhh. - Look. Mother fucker! What did I just tell you? This guy's trying to kill me, man. I gotta get out of here with this eel. I don't know what he's gonna do to me. Please, I... Oh god. I need a room for the night. - Just for the night. - Yes. Is it just you-- - Only me. - Who's this? This, uhh... This is, uhh... great man. This man... This man... This man is going to be the godfather of my son. What is he doing? - It's OK. He's fine. - What is he doing? So there are three of you? I'm gonna put you down for three. What is he doing with our son? He is going to be godfather. - Him? - Yeah, right? Yes. You, you are, family now. I baptize thee. En nomine Patris. Et Fili. Et Spiritus Sancti. May God who has received you. By baptism into the church. Pour upon you the riches of his grace. And come to the inheritance of the saints. In Jesus Christ's name. - Amen. - Amen. Amen. Hey, Kelly. Kelly! - Hey. - What? Uhh... Good night. Hello? Why have you stopped? You only have one more to go. My battery, my battery's dying and I, I... - I didn't bring a phone charger. - Hold on. So, hello? Hello? Shit! Shit. OK. Let's just think about this. We'll just, uhh... Just, uhh... What? What's going on? What? Hold on. Hold on a second. Hold on. Let's use our words. I just... Hold on. Hello? Right, problem solved. Well... Yeah. No problem. I don't know, you had me followed all day. Yeah, I told you at the beginning. Well, he's a big scary guy. I mean, I could have used his help by the... What? Is this... tricks? Is it what you're doing? You're playing tricks on me? Just admit that you're having fun. - What? What? No. No. What? - No? May I ask you a question, please? Sure. I've done three out of four. Can you please just let me go home? You're doing great. I didn't ask you to kill one of my competitors. I mean, that was really something. I never would have thought you were a killer. No, that wasn't me. That was a man in a chicken mask. Well, you're not kidding, you really do need some sleep. I'm serious. That's something that really happened to me. - You sure you're not on drugs? - I don't do drugs. Yes, I just did drugs with the Romanian but you know, he told me it was herbal and, he offered me more money I've ever seen. Yes, but it didn't kill you, right? I mean, I'm guessing that some part of you even enjoyed it. I mean, listen to you. You sound like a brand-new man. You're loving this, right? Isn't this exciting? I don't wanna do this any more. I just wanna go home. Well, this isn't over, Kelly. Look. I understand. You need encouragement, right? And I'm betting that if I threaten to kill you right now, you'd welcome it. So... What if I were to tell you that I once stood in that exact same spot you're standing in right now. I can remember a time in my life where I lived in a boring go-nowhere kind of groove. Dreams, sure, but... no will to get there, no drive. I needed that push and one day I got just that. And what I learned what you're learning now it will make you a better person. Well, I don't feel like a better person. All right. Well, I guess I'm not great at giving motivational speeches. Fuck it, how about you just finish up. Or what? Fuck, it's cold. Uhh. Hot. Uhh. I'm sorry. Just gonna, just get the - So... - So what's up? Are you, you're Brody? - Yeah. - OK. Well, this is yours. And I'll uhh... I'll just... That's what I'm talking about. Oh my god. - Thank you. - OK. - Thank you so much. - Yeah. - I'm just gonna, I'll talk to-- - Hey, where are you going? Uhh, they told me you were paid up and you were fine so I'm just gonna-- Oh, wait, wait, wait. I'm so sorry. You can't just leave. - Why? - Just sit down. Take a seat. Relax. What's your name? I'd rather not say. - My friends call me Bear. - Uhuh. My name is Brody. Brody Hobbs. You can call me Brody. Just call me Brody. When can I leave, Brody? You're a real killer, aren't you? You've got a set on you, Trevor. I mean... Trevor? My name's Kelly. - I shouldn't have said that. - Kelly. So there's another Trevor. Is that like a code name or something? Uhh, it doesn't matter. You could be Sally, you could be Jane... Have you, uhh... ever sold drugs to an undercover cop? Yeah. Well, no. Not lately. Funny thing is, I actually, umm... I haven't done anything like this before. Yeah, that's real. OK. First thing is, I'm just, been dropping off the boxes so when you opened it up I didn't know that was in there. You didn't really give me any money so there's no exchange of goods and services. - So you can't really arrest me-- - Hey, hey, look, look. I'm not gonna do anything to you. Cheer up, Sally. Know this, though. I'm the real deal. You're not gonna leave until I allow it. And I'm not gonna allow it until you help me do what I need to do tonight. The thing is... What do you want me to do? Your temporary boss is connected to some really powerful people. I don't even know him. And tonight we're gonna help him. 'Cause we're all part of the machine, bro. And when the machine breaks down we break down. Let's go. Let's go! Fucking machine. Is that your car? Yeah. Yeah, hold on. Yes, sir. Keys. Call me Brody. Call you Brody. I thought I could call you Bear. No. You haven't earned it yet. - What's this thing? - Relax. That's my thing. Don't touch the rabbit's foot. - Sorry. - Relax. Yeah. You couldn't find somebody else to come on this ride? No. Partner's supposed to come with. He couldn't make it. So I need some support. And we have business to take care of. Let's just say it was cleaner than the competition, mate. Mr. X wants to do it legally, though drug busts and such. And I heard you're a real stone cold killer, Sally. I never killed anyone. Yeah, well, fuck all that. Sally! You awake? Sally! Yeah, just... What? It's green. Thank you. What are we doing, specifically? You're gonna help me out tonight, it's not hard work. You can sit silently right next to me and not say one word. No cowboy killer shit. - OK? - Yeah. I need you to be smooth. Be America's favorite. What? I need to know that you're not gonna buckle, Sally. Buckle? How are you with stress? Risky situations? You ever been shot? Huh? What? No. OK. The rumor I heard about you wasn't correct. It's fine. I haven't been shot either. And I don't want to try out that experience, you feeling me? Yeah. I, uhh, I feel you. Oh, hey... What? What the hell was that? You can't flinch. You can't flinch, bro. - Let's try it again. - I... Go on. You ca-- You can't fucking flinch. It looks like you were gonna fucking hit me, Brody. Exactly. Everyone in there is going to look like they wanna kill you. You need to stop acting like a bitch. So you tell me that they're gonna wanna fucking kill me? No. Not if you act like a man, someone that knows danger. I thought you were a killer, man. You were a killer. Shit. You know danger? I... know of it. All right, this isn't gonna work. I have an idea. I have an idea. We've got like, ten minutes. Let's go. Come here. I've got an idea. Follow me. Come here. Hey. Don't stare at my boy too hard. Last person that did that now has only one eye. You hear? Is that so? He was missing it before I ever got there. So what's up? Why am I waiting here? You gonna serve me dinner, drinks? What's going on? Where's Tommy? I was supposed to meet Tommy. Tommy couldn't make it tonight. Security concerns. He thanks you for your patience in these trying times. - What do I call you? - Daddy. Just call me Daddy. Don't you have to be looking after the floor? Didn't take my medication. The lights give me seizures and shit. Plus my feet have been killing me. I got that cough that's been going on. Just shut up. Shut the fuck up. I'm really glad I can be part of you guys' HR meeting. I'm supposed to deal with the guy I dealt with before. I don't know you, I don't deal with you. That's a shame. Yeah, it is real shame. You lost out tonight. Let's go. Get up. Take a seat. I'll see what your deal is. So I got your attention. Take a seat. I don't know you, I don't deal with you. And if it looks good I'll get you Tommy. OK. This is what we've got. - OK. - Yeah? This is good. Just one more thing. What? Do a line. Really? You want me to do a line. I'm not happy about this. I'm not happy about this. Let's get something smaller. OK. - What? - Go ahead. - Go ahead, what? - Taste this, idiot. Do the line. Oh. No, thank you. What's his deal? Yeah, what's your deal? Uhh... I just, brushed my teeth earlier. You know, the taste of toothpaste and doing cocaine... Do the line. OK. Here's the thing. Seriously, guys. It's great, and I'm thankful but I just got to doing a lot of crazy drugs and I'm all messed up, and I baptized some eel. Do we have a problem? Don't talk to my boy like that. Do the line. Do the line. OK. Dollar bills. Nervous. Huh. Thank you. It's good, right? It's good shit, right? It's enjoyable. Very good. Now you. What are you talking about, man? I'm amped up. I can't do any more of that. I'm gonna have a heart attack. I don't care if I break your heart, motherfucker. I don't trust you. You could be a cop. A cop. He thinks I'm a cop. Think a cop would make him snort that cocaine? Yeah. I do. Do the line. Or what? You gonna do something? You ever tasted your teeth, bro? Ever tasted your teeth? I won't do it. I won't do it. Let's go. Hey! Whoah! Whoah! Where the fuck is Tommy? I wanna leave. What the fuck is this? I wanna leave. I'll kill any of you people. I just wanna go to sleep. Get the fuck out of here. Don't you fucking move. Point the gun at him. At him, not me. What is this? Get Tommy now. Get fucking Tommy now. I know he's back there. - Get Tommy now! - I'm gonna pull out my phone. Do not do anything stupid. Oh, he won't. Oh, he won't. Yeah. You're gonna wanna step in here. It's really heavy. Where are you now? Where are you now? It's that fucking cowboy killer shit. I told you about that. What? Look who it is. Yeah? What the fuck is happening in here? Umm, I don't know. Maybe if you were here a little bit ago, none of this would have happened. Why didn't you call me? I was, till this cocksucker smashed a bottle over his head. Did that happen? Yeah, it happened. You know why? Because your boy was reaching for the gun. So my boy smashed his fucking head with a bottle. This motherfucker doped him up with a bunch of cocaine. Of course it happened. That happened? Didn't know these two inbred fucks were loose cannons. Jesus. Put the gun down, kid. You're gonna hurt yourself. Don't put that down. Don't you put that fucking gun down. Give the boy some cash. You've got ourselves a deal. Is there somewhere we can go? They gave us a deal. - They're gonna give us-- - Shhh. Oh, thank fuck. All right. What's that? It's my beeper. - Who the hell has a beeper-- - Shut the fuck up. Let's do it right now. Get on the ground now! Don't you fucking move! Don't fucking move. We need to go. We need to go. Don't even look at me. You're both fucking dead. I lost my gun. - What about the gun? - Now listen. My people know what's happening, they're gonna be here soon. What do we do until then? Just try not to get yourself killed. - How do I do that, Brody? - Run. Fuck. Don't fucking lose it this time. I won't. Come out, come out, wherever you are, motherfucker. Motherfucker. Get your fucking shit together. You broke my nose. I can barely breathe. Come on, come on. You really fucking hurt me. I'm sorry. You fuck! What the fuck was that? Fuck you. Son of a bitch. No, wait. Wait, wait, don't shoot. Don't shoot. I can't even fight, man. Shut up and close your eyes, you idiot. All right. Wait. I know where he keeps his money. What money? He took over $100,000. I have the address. You can have it, it's all yours. - Show me. - It's on my phone. Uhh... Right here. Here, take my phone. Oh. Strobe lights give you seizures and shit, huh? Should have taken your medicine. What's up? This is fucked up. All right, buddy. Hey, hey, hey. Let's calm, take a breath. Take a breath. Take a breath. That's... You're gonna be all right. You're gonna be all right. Don't fucking touch me. OK. You're gonna be cool, man. You're gonna be cool. I've never had the pleasure of killing a cop before. Thank you officer. Hey. I got nothing. Holy shit. Holy shit. One punch. I mean, you had a running start. Guy didn't see you. You saved my life. It's all that matters. - Yeah. - Yeah. Hey, where's the other guy? Uhh... the other guy, he, uhh... well, I kicked his ass. Real, real bad. One punch? One punch. You're a killer, Sally. Yeah. - Kelly. - Thanks. Thank you. You helped take out a bad guy tonight. While helping another one. No. You helped me. You helped me. Going all the way to the top, not stopping. What do you mean, Mr. X? Adam. That was my partner's. He got shot today in the middle of the street. Mr. X is gonna trust you now. I could use a guy on the inside. Think about it. - Brody... - Bear. Gummy Bear. I just wanna stay out of trouble for the rest of my life so if you could just let me walk away-- - You got it. Get out of here. - Yeah? - Go. - Seriously? - Get out of here. - Thanks. Now. Get out of here, before I change my mind. Hey, Kelly! Yeah? I'll see you soon. Hey! Got a second? No, I'm sorry. Can's still a little too far over, man. So when they come to take this today they're gonna mark it down on their list. Get out of my face! Oh, no, no. No. I did the four jobs. I did everything he told me to do. Why are you still here? Call him up on the phone. Tell him I'm done with this. Get the camera out of my face. I'll kick your ass. Look at my face! Do you know the kind of day I've had? 'Cause I'll tell you something. I'm not scared of you guys any more after-- Kelly. Hey, sorry about that zap but I just want to say congratulations face to face - you know? - A phone call would have been fine. I love this guy. You kill me. I am done, though. Right? Sure. OK, so... You didn't bring me to this place to like, shoot me or whatever, you know? No, no, this place is scary. But no, you're fine. So... Well, this is crazy what I'm gonna ask you especially because... well... Kelly, you're a horrible drug dealer. I mean, just the worst. It's like bananas, how fucking bad you are. But, I wanna offer you another job. I know, I know. You're probably saying no on repeat inside your head right now. Well, you know, what I'm saying on repeat inside my head are the questions I've been asking all night. OK, like, why me? Why did you do this to me? Well, I don't have to explain myself to you. Let's see. What will solve the mystery for you? I picked you, Kelly quite frankly because I can. And there's not a fucking thing you can do about it. How do you know that? 'Cause I've got all your adventures right here. I'm gonna add them to my collection when I get home. You're quite the criminal. I see. It's almost like I've done this before. Well, look. You guys don't have to worry about me. Oh, I know that, Kelly. I was just curious if you'd ever consider doing this for me you know, like on a regular basis. Uhh... I understand. You've had a stressful night. You need to think about it. I'll tell you what. If the answer is yes answer that phone. If not, then... That's that. Yeah. Uhh... Hey, what's your favorite color? Umm... Green. Huh. Just like me. How about that? Genuine pleasure doing business with you, Kelly. Trevor. Hey, Trevor. Fuck. Are you dead? - No. - Oh. Kelly? Yeah, man? Hey. How's your day? Had a bad day, Trevor. Had a bad day.
