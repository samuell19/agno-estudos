[music] [speaking russian] [music playing] [speaking russian] Running red. [gunshot] You know your directives? Yes. Time to rock and roll. Major Cheung, I trust you had a pleasant trip. Major. MAJOR CHEUNG: The nerve gas has been enhanced to our specifications? COLONEL DIAZ: That is correct. The kill cycle has been increased three times its original state. Mr. Mercier, you realize that the ship must leave by 0700 hours if we are to avoid alerting NATO? Yes, I do. And there won't be any problem, Major. The ship will leave right on time. Colonel Diaz. Yes, the vials are being injected and sealed as we speak. [music playing] Look out. [gunshot] Try me. PATROL THREE (ON RADIO): Patrol three. Report, south perimeter is secure. COMMANDER (ON RADIO): Copy that, patrol three. [non-english speech] [crashing] [groaning] One man with a radio brings a hundred with guns. Come on. Let's go. Hey, Maria you look great today. Mama? Oh, sweetie, I told you to go play in the back. [groaning] What's she doing here? [speaking spanish],, my husband got drunk again. He was arrested last night. I had to bring her here. [gunshots] Let's move. [gunshots] Get down. [gunshots] Lock down the plant now. And ready the helicopter. [speaking spanish] I believe you have a security problem, Mr. Mercier. I've got the best guards money can buy. Forgive me if I appear skeptical. The helicopter's warming up right now. [gunshots] [gunshots] [gunshots] A Soviet, no? You should suffer. Yes. [gunshots] Mr. Mercier, I believe we have more pressing issues. [gunshots] Come on, Major, the helicopter's one floor down. [gunshots] Go, go, go, go, go! Shit! [gunshots] Call the helicopter. Tell them to land here, now. But there's nowhere for it to-- Just do it. [gunshots] You sons of bitch. Come on! You all right? Yeah, they've got us pinned down here. [gunshots] [non-english speech] [gunshots] [explosion] [shouting] [gunshots] Where's the goddamn helicopter? It's on its way. [gunshots] The glass is bulletproof. Extreme deflection. Cover me. [gunshots] Let's go. ALEXI: You have the angle. I got it. [gunshots] [gunshots] [music playing] [gunshots] Hey! Hey, come back! Come back! You fucking bastards! [gunshots] Where's Sergei? We've got to leave before the MIG arrives. He probably didn't make it. I'm not leaving without my brother! [groaning] No. Sergei. It was Messier. I was stupid. I was looking at-- No, it wasn't your fault, little brother. Come, I'll take you home now. I don't think so. [music playing] He's gone. Come on. Finish her. She's just a child. I don't care if she's your own daughter. No witnesses. I gave you an order. I said no. All right. The explosion will probably get her anyway. Go on. Go on. Go. No. [gunshots] It's done. You killed a child. I gave you an order. Never disobey my order. We must get moving. COMMANDER (ON RADIO): Rover one, all homing devices are activated. Weapons are free. Repeat, weapons are free. [explosion] Too bad Mercier got away. We did our job. We stopped them. It's over. Yes, it's over. [music playing] Tired? Relaxed, thanks to you. You're welcome. Found Amanda's slinky. Ah, chilled the way I like it. Hey, Dad. I've been looking for this. - Give me a kiss. - OK. Morning. You kids have all the fun, don't you? Well, I wouldn't say that. Hey, how about if we have a barbecue tonight? I'll go get some chicken. Hamburgers, too. There are too many hamburgers in your life, young lady. I have a budget meeting tonight. You guys know what pot luck means, right? I guess it's just you and me tonight, kid. Unless pot luck means hamburgers, only you, Dad. - Will you do me a favor? - Yeah. Will you go to the cleaners and pick up my cheerleading uniform? Honey, I know you're my biggest fan, but let's not overdo it, OK? It's for my reunion. I have $100 riding on it. Whoever can still fit in their cheerleading uniform wins. Good morning, everyone. We do have a front door, you know. Well, yeah, but this is where you keep the food. You ready Amanda? Thanks for dropping her off. Hey, what are neighbors for? Besides, it's my day off. Yeah, how's your new job going? Very sexy new boss. That's a little bit too much information if you don't mind. Where'd you get that jersey? Oh, I went out with that hockey player again last night. How'd it go? Can you say double overtime? I know you're talking about boys when you do that. Oh, you're a smarty. Come on, time for school. Hi five, babe. AMANDA: Love you. - Love you, too. Love you, honey. That was my banana. Dad, Mom never picks me up this late. GREG: Yeah, but-- AMANDA: No buts, Dad. GREG: --Mom doesn't have Monster Mashers. No way. Hey, Dad, thanks. You're welcome. Can we stop for a Coke? Oh, honey, you know what your mom says about that. Fathers and daughters need to have some secrets. Deal. Deal. [music playing] I'll be right back. They're here. Can you get rid of them? Oh, I can get rid of them. Question is for how long. They're resilient little bastards. You know, in your lean times, a cockroach will eat one of his own limbs to survive. Now, would you do that? I don't think so. Great. Oh, for God's sake sir, please keep your voice down. You're scaring away my customers. Now just get rid of them. God I love the sound of that crunch when you pulverize one of those little fuckers. Please, sir, just do it quietly. CLERK: Will that be all, sir? Yes. No, actually. Do you carry Forbes Magazine here? Yes, you'll find that right in the back. [clatter] Oh no. The whole thing, yeah. Whoa. I'm all right. I'm all right. You all right? Leave me alone. I'm on level four. Full tank, dude. This is a little bigger job than I thought. Please, quietly, sir. I'm gonna have to go out the van. Get the big guns. Let's go. I am gonna make a fortune on this job. [tires squealing] Amanda. Call the police! Whoa. What the hell? What the hell you think you're doing, buddy? Don't you know it's a federal offense messing with a bug buster? You better pull this van over right now. They got my daughter. Yeah! Chop shop will give us plenty for this baby. THIEF: Yeah, it will. [shouting] There's a kid back here. Shit! THIEF: Pick it up, man. It's the bug guy. Now I got you. You give up now, I'll tell them to go easy on you. That smarts. All right, sir, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. Now, do you understand these rights as I've explained them to you? Shut up! I got it. [laughing] [crashing] Oh God. Oh boy. Won't let us by your truck, huh? Why don't you step out of the car, tough guy? Come on. [screaming] Amanda. Are you okay? Whoa, Dad, how did you? Whoa, Dad. Listen, honey, I don't want mommy to get upset, so let's just keep this between us, OK? - OK. - All right, come on let's go. Come on. Wait, Dad? Yeah? Did you get the Cokes? [laughter] GREG: OK, get in the car. REPORTER (ON TV): Unfortunately, the home video footage was unable to catch the license number of the car. Police are asking anyone with information about the unknown crime fighter to call the crime tipsters at 800-555-3698. However, I do have with me Mr. Wally Gorch, a partial witness to today's activities here in this neighborhood. Mr. Gorch, what can you tell us about what happened here today? WALLY: Well, Suzy. I can call you Suzy? Yeah, there must have been nine or 10 of them. Now, I fought them off as best I could with the karate moves. That's about when this other fella shows up. Now, he helps me mop up the last couple. And then I believe that's when your video guy showed up. You know, after I'd already done my thing. Hey, handsome. Hi. How was your day? The usual. Is Amanda in bed? Yeah, she's out like a light. Hey, why don't you take a nice, hot shower. And maybe I'll give you a massage later. Well, that sounds great, but I've got to get some food. Can I talk you out of these clothes first? Tell you what. I'll compromise. A turkey sandwich first and the massage right after. Turkey sandwich first. Can I talk you out of it. Lettuce and tomato on white, please. GREG: OK. REPORTER (ON TV): Not everyone-- GREG: Come on, honey, don't turn on the TV. It's just the news. REPORTER (ON TV): City Councilman Earl Chambers is at the forefront to stop the new sports arena. We don't need a stadium built on public lands. What we need is more housing, more police, better schools, and more park. You know, I agree with Chambers. If they're gonna get rid of the park, they should at least sell it for a lot of money. REPORTER (ON TV): Police are still unable to identify the mysterious stranger who beat up the two hoodlums. Now, I know it's blurry, Fred, but can you run that videotape again, please? Your sandwich is done. Oh, that's service. Hey, check it out. This guy's pulling the kung fu on these guys. [screaming] Hey, Greg, that guy looks like you. Lucky guy. That's our car. Sandwich? Why didn't you call the police? Why didn't you call me? Maybe I should have called you, but Amanda's OK. We don't need a bunch of police reporters descending on us. What do you think I was gonna do, run down to channel nine? Look, honey, these guys might have been in a gang. I mean, you read the newspapers. The less said, the better. Amanda's all right, that's really all that matters. You had no right keeping this to yourself. I deserve to know. I am her mother, in case you haven't noticed. I'm sorry. I was just trying to spare you. I was wrong. Where'd you learn all that stuff anyway? In the army. I thought you said you were a cook. I was. But with my cooking, you had to learn how to defend yourself. That's not funny. Well, it was a little funny. I'm serious, Greg. I was really scared. I'm never gonna let anything happen to you or Amanda. Come here. REPORTER (ON RADIO): If you're thinking of getting on the 405 south, don't. And if you're already sitting in it-- How does one person go through 18 pairs of socks in one week? I'm sorry, did you say something? REPORTER (ON RADIO): Thanks, Bill. Police are still looking for the vigilante who made short work yesterday of a couple of car thieves in the Valley. Witnesses gave differing descriptions. Enough of that. Thank you. [phone ringing] Hello? STRELKIN (ON PHONE): Your tickets are ready. I'm sorry. I think you have the wrong number. Moscow Circus is in town. Perhaps you've forgotten, Mr. Wallace. [phone ringing] Mr. Wallace, you have to pay for your reservations. I don't know what you're talking about. Remember what I told you, Gregori. Never disobey an order. Hilton lobby. One hour. Be there. I left the service 11 years ago. ALEXI: You never leave the service. So you are determined to use Gregori? I can't do it. You certainly can't do it. Want to keep this operation as subtle as possible. The less people who know about our history, the better. Besides, he's the best. Mercier and Diaz, they meet this week. Relax, comrade. I'll make him an offer he can't refuse. You just keep an eye on Chambers. People are starting to listen to him. Don't worry, I'll take care of it. [knocking] VALET: Sir? Thanks. [chattering] Gregori, it's good to see you. Sit, please. [speaking russian] I'm an American now, and I speak only English. I've missed you, Gregori. I'm sorry. Greg. How did you find me? Was it that-- that little piece on the TV? Yes, I saw you, but we always knew where you were. Excuse me, sir, can I offer you a drink? GREG: No, thank you. Thank you. I'm in real estate now. It's tough for some, but Americans, they're soft like Tootsie Rolls. We Soviets, we thrive on hardship. The Soviet Union is gone. Yes, but the loyalties still remain. You forget, I brought you here. If not for me, you would be rotting in some Ukrainian prison, along with all those other fools who stayed behind. You knew that the payback would have to come on day. Well, that day is here. What is it you want? I have a problem. I am being threatened with exposure. As you say, you have a problem. If I have a problem, Gregori Ilyanov, you have a problem. We did some terrible things, no? Does your wife know about your previous life? No, of course not. What do you think she would say if she knew that you were a trained killer? If we are revealed everything changes. You know, in some ways, you have more to lose than I do. You made a beautiful family here. I envy you. Why ruin it? If you cooperate, I promise you I will call my friends in Moscow. They will erase your combat file. The Gregory Ilyanov I know will cease to exist. What exactly do you want me to do? Cheer up. There is something in it for you too. I think you remember this man. You should. He killed your brother. [music playing] [laughter] Excuse me, sir, you forgot your key. What? Your key. Gregori. I thought I recognized your voice. Follow me. Come here. Come here. Strelkin has already done the prep work for you. He's still my aide. I'm here only for Mercier. Sit down, please. Give him the file. This is the current information on Mercier. And this one is for Diaz. Mercier's stooge? He moved up in this world. He now handles all Mercier's arms deals. What about Mercier? Moved into drugs. Mercier has a criminal indictment pending. He's looking to make a deal. He's trying to peddle information on me. What exactly do you want me to do about it? What you do so well, kill him. That's not me anymore. I've got a family now. I haven't held a gun in 11 years. ALEXI: But you have the skill. Remember, we saw you a few days ago. I only did that because my daughter was in danger. Get him to do it. Look at his hand. I can still kill, if I'm close enough. We're handing Mercier to you on a silver platter. When? The two of you will travel to Detroit tomorrow. Tomorrow? I have plans with my wife tomorrow. She can go to the reunion by herself. We do our homework. And since we are all capitalists here, there's $50,000 in it for you. No strings attached. You can keep your money. All I want is your word of honor that this will be the only hit. You have my word. Hey, you look great. Why do you have a suitcase packed? Because I have to go to Detroit this weekend. You've got to be joking. What about my reunion? I know. I'm sorry. They didn't give me any notice. There's some kind of a problem with the McKendry account. I thought you were off the McKendry account? I was. But some problems with the stock options not going through. If I don't go this weekend, we're gonna lose the account. So when were you planning on telling me all of this? After Amanda went to bed tonight. Greg, I'm not mad. I know it's not your fault. I'm just disappointed. You know how long I've been looking forward to this. I wanted to show you off to all my old friends. I'm really sorry, honey. Look, you just give me this weekend, and I promise I'll make it up to you. Wow, look at that pretty picture. It's gonna be a mommy killer whale. Really? Should've known. Hey, I just saw Greg leaving with a suitcase. Where is he going? Detroit. Honey, what about your reunion? Let me guess, business trip? Mhm. Yeah. Remember Bill, my first ex-husband? He used to go on a lot of business trips. One day he came home, I checked his briefcase. Guess what? Completely empty. Not Greg. No, not Greg. He's one of the best. I'm just once bitten, twice shy. Shy? Not exactly. Hey, you got any coffee? [music playing] Diaz has the guns now. Mercier has raised his usual price, but they think the deal with Cubans will go down tonight anyway. Where's Mercier? No sign of him yet, but he'll be there. He doesn't trust Diaz that much. It's just a few guards. Diaz has gotten lazy. Living in America does that to you, huh? But don't you worry, there will be plenty of security tonight. Precision hit. Limited access. It's not gonna be easy. You'll have to get close. Hi, honey, it's me. I didn't want to bother you at the office. I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry. And if there was any way I could have been there for you today, I would've. My appointments here. I'll call you from the airport. Love you. You got it? STRELKIN: Six shot .38, custom silencer, and three clips. Black Talons. GREG: I asked for a Beretta. That's Alexi's choice. Then let Alexi do it. Next time I ask for something, you deliver exactly that, or I take the next plane home. Are you forgetting something? You work for us. You do as we say. [phone ringing] Yes? I'll be there. Diaz has arrived. And Merc may be in town already. I'll be back in an hour. This is not over. [music playing] Cold out here tonight. Here they come. Cubans are here. Okay, gentlemen, time to make some money. Keep your eyes open. I don't trust these guys. [music playing] [speaking spanish] I trust that you brought the money. In bearer bonds, as you requested. Where's your boss, Mercier? He got stuck in L.A. [speaking spanish] Business. But when you deal with me, you deal with him. I don't deal with flunkies, all right? You get your goddamn boss down here right now before I get angry. I'm just kidding. Hey, just relax guys. Relax. I always wanted to say that, you know? Just like on the television. Messier isn't here. Only Diaz. Where are the guns? Send them. CUSTOMER: What the hell is this, huh? Going on a field trip? To the zoo, maybe? Cops check trucks. Not buses. STRELKIN: Gregori, do Diaz now. I'm here only for Mercier. So he couldn't make it. Kill Diaz. You're a smart guy, Diaz. Gonna send you guys some Cuban cigars. They're illegal here, you know. Makes them taste better don't you think? State of the art. This is bullshit. Mercier's supposed to be here. Well, he isn't Do it. DIAZ: 30 cases, ready for shipment. Our deal was for 40 cases. Yes, but customs is cracking down on us right now. When we say 40 cases, we mean 40 cases. STRELKIN: Gregori, you have to [inaudible] him, damn it. This time, I am not joking. Set up! [gunshots] Save him! [gunshots] [camera clicking] [honking] Sorry. Slower cars move to the right! Wanna play with the big boys? Come on. [shouting] [bell chiming] Shit. [music playing] [laughter] [steam whistle blowing] [screaming] [crashing] [glass shattering] Nice driving. You cut it close. Too close. Come on, go, go! You're home early. My lunch meeting canceled. Maybe we can get Stephanie to babysit Amanda. We could go to dinner tonight, huh? So you were gone when I got up this morning. I had an early conference with John and Tracy. AMANDA: Daddy. Daddy, come see. I'll be right back. OK, let's see. All right, that was good. She's fine. She really loves her new toys. So how did the reunion go? I didn't go. Why not? Because I didn't want to go without you. [phone ringing] I'm sorry, honey. I know how much it meant to you. Hello? It's for you. Hello. ALEXI (ON PHONE): Congratulations, Diaz is dead. A little messier than I would have liked, but you can't make an omelet without breaking some eggs. Look, you got what you wanted. I'm done. ALEXI (ON PHONE): Not yet, Gregori. Mercier still breathes. I don't care. I want out. ALEXI (ON PHONE): That is not our arrangement. Be at the hotel in one hour, and don't be late. I did the job in Detroit. Diaz is dead. The fact that Mercier wasn't there is not my fault. May not be your fault, but it is your problem. What do you think the media would do if they found those photographs? Why should Mercier have all the fun? Drugs, women, you name it. While your life is falling apart, and your brother, Sergei, is rotting in a Spanish grave unavenged. You gave me your word. Doesn't that mean anything to you anymore? Not since I moved to L.A. Now, it so happens that Mercier has developed an unhealthy heroin habit. He's having a party this afternoon to which you, posing as a drug dealer, will attend. One of his party girls will be waiting for you. She will get you into the party, This afternoon? Yeah. All right. [music playing] Katherine? Honey? Amanda? Katherine? Honey? Damn it. Katherine! What? Didn't you hear me? What the hell have you been doing? Gardening. What's it look like? The front door is open, and the window is broken. What is going on? I locked myself out. I had to break the window to get in the house. Then I left the door open, sorry. Where's Amanda? Greg, it's Tuesday. She's at dance class. Right. OK, that's it. What's it? I'm under a lot of pressure at work right now. I want you to take Amanda and go stay at Stephanie's dad's cabin in Arrowhead for a while. Will you do that? What are you talking about? We're not going anywhere. Do me a favor, will you? Listen to me, just this once. No, would you do me a favor? If you want to clear us out to turn our home into a love nest with another woman, don't give me some lame ass excuse about work and pressure and all that garbage. Another woman. What are you talking about? I know why you went to Detroit. Oh you do, do you? But if you're gonna ruin what we have, I wish you'd at least have guts enough to do it to my face. OK, I will. I have kept some things from you. I was in the army. What does that have to do with it? It wasn't the American army. It was the Russian army. What? There are some men from my past. They want me to do something for them. If they don't get what they want, they might hurt you. They might even hurt Amanda. The police can't stop them. There's really only one thing that can. If there was ever a time I needed you to believe in me, honey, it's now. I trust you, Greg. But if anything happens to our daughter-- I'm not gonna let anything happen to either one of you. Now, please, go pack your bags. I'll call Stephanie. I'll have her pick you up after work. OK, but you have a lot of explaining to do when you get back. [music playing] STRELKIN: Leave the money to [inaudible] when she introduces you to Mercier. What about the weapon? I'm sure there will be plenty of metal detectors. You are the weapon. Meet Fawn, old friend of mine. Hi, I'm Nick. Nice to meet you, Nick. Fawn is a regular at Mercier's parties. You will go in as a her new supplier. So I get you in, and then I get the money. That's all I have to do, right? That's all. You like partying, Nick? I'm married, thanks. Who isn't? Hey, Frankie. Adam. Did you miss me? GREG: So are these all Mercier's friends? Guys like Mercier don't have friends. They have associates. You either have something that he wants to buy, or you want to buy something he's got to sell. And where do you fit in on that plan? Don't judge me, Nick. I've got something all men want to buy. I get you into this party, you give me the money. We're associates. Fair enough. Showtime, Nick. Hey, Johnny, how's it hanging? Well, I got you in, so where's my money? Where's Mercier? Look, he's around someplace. He's always around. Yeah, well I need an introduction. You see, there you go changing our relationship, Nick. We had a deal. No, your deal was with Strelkin. No Mercier, no money. Well, then maybe we should look upstairs. Good choice. Well, he should be here somewhere. Hey, how you doing, Fawn? Hey. Who's your friend? Oh, this is Nick. You better be nice to him. He's one of Colonel Diaz's friends. This is Dominic, Mercier's associate. I want a drink. Make yourself useful, huh? Sure. So you're a friend of Colonel Diaz, huh? That's right. How come I've never seen you with him? Well, I like to keep a low profile. Diaz does too. About six feet low. Well, Mercier won't mind if I take care of deliveries from now on. We'll see Come with me. So where's the boss? He'll want a sample. Show me the money. You know who the hell you're dealing with? You better be a hell of a lot faster than you look. [shouting] Dominic. That's enough, Dominic. Take a hike. Later. I hear you got some private stock. It's expensive. I think I can afford it Pure heroin. None better. MERCIER: Pure heroin. Pure horse shit. What are you trying to pull? I don't understand. My brother, he said it was the real stuff. You brother? Well, screw your brother. You already screwed my brother. You don't remember him? Spain? The nerve gas shipment? Remember, everything went bad at the last minute? What are you crazy? I-- I don't know your brother. GREG: Now you remember him? You blew his knees out just before he died. [moaning] [screaming] Let's get him. Kill that son of a bitch. Now I'll never get my money. [gunshots] Come on, we need to find him. Let's go! [music playing] There he is. He got away, you idiot. Down to the water. Heading into the park. Let's split up. - Anything? - Nothing yet. Well, keep looking. [music playing] HENCHMAN: Hold him up. Freeze, asshole. I don't now who the hell you think you are. You think you can come in to our party, huh? Screw with me, kill my boss, then what? Run over here and play in the park? Well, screw you, asshole. Hurry, police are on the way. [music playing] Where are they? Your family is fine. I could kill you now and then find Strelkin. You know me better than that. If you hurt me, they will die. That's better. [speaking russian] If you hurt them in any way-- Gregori, to hurt them now would be not only stupid, but it would be un-American. I have one more task for you. One measly little task for you. We don't need a stadium built on public lands. What we need is more housing, better schools, and more parks. Chambers will be in Clarion Park tomorrow at noon before the rally to prepare for his media circus. It's 200 yards. It's difficult. But for you, piece of cake. You know, I love that American vernacular. Chambers is not a drug dealer. You don't have any past with him. Did I say I did? This is not about exposure, is it? This is about the state. Welcome to reality, Gregori. I now own the lion's share of a professional football team. We need a stadium for them to play in. It's as simple as that. Mercier never, ever threatened you with exposure then, did he? No. You were a gunrunner with him. That's how you made the money to pay for the stadium, isn't it? That's why you wanted him killed, just in case somebody like Chambers might look into your past. That's good, Greg. Good. You do not succeed in this country in business unless you step on some toes. Oh, don't look so shocked. That's what I'm doing. I'm living the American dream. I don't think too many CEOs have murder on their resume. I have sunk $10 million dollars into that stadium. Into that team. I think that's very American, don't you? Now you think I'm going to see that all lost because of some loudmouth politician who's looking for votes? No, I don't think so. And you are going to ensure that that does not happen. KATHERINE (ON PHONE): Honey, we're OK so far, but please do what he says. AMANDA (ON PHONE): Daddy, help us. I'm so scared. One condition. I'm listening. I see my family before I do the hit. You'll see them. And the moment I do it, you release them. Agreed? Why not? Strelkin will be waiting for you at four this afternoon in the park. Don't keep him waiting. Go get some rest. What's our position? Brownfield Plaza Hotel. Our cover, elevator repairmen. Security is a joke there. Virtually doesn't exist. What am I using? Remington with Leupold scope. Subsonic ammunition. Personally, the radio bomb would have done it for me. And kill maybe 100 innocent people instead of one? What's the difference? GREG: This thing is too rushed. I don't like it. There's going to be mistakes. STRELKIN: It's going to be fine. GREG: Is that what you told my family? STRELKIN: It's only 200 yards. I saw you do a mile. GREG: Not like this. I had more time. STRELKIN: His car will arrive two hours before the rally at approximately 1100 hours. He'll go to the stage to check the preparations. The best shot will be before he reaches the podium. That's my department. What happens afterwards? A car will be waiting for us. Then what? That's my department. All right. It's gonna be okay honey. Mom, where's Stephanie? She's in heaven. I'm so scared. It's gonna be OK. Daddy's gonna help us. [music playing] Little wind. Low humidity. Conditions are good, Gregori. Where's my family? Nearby. Base? ALEXI (ON RADIO): Copy. Condition red. ALEXI (ON RADIO): Understood, vanguard. Running red. So in 10 minutes your problems will be over, unless you miss. For our good and the betterment of all our families. Isn't that laying it on a little thick? So far you've been getting great press on the nightly news. People are looking for anything to take the blame for their problems, television, guns, movies, sports stadiums. It'll get you votes. OK, I'll say it. ALEXI (ON RADIO): Three minutes, vanguard. I want to see my family. Base. ALEXI (ON RADIO): Copy. Daddy wants to say hi. ALEXI (ON RADIO): Put him on. Where are they? ALEXI (ON RADIO): Safe. All right, no more messing around. I see my family now or I walk, Alexi. ALEXI (ON RADIO): Fair enough. The side of the building. Look down. You'll see a blue van. What about Amanda? Dad. Amanda are you all right? AMANDA (ON RADIO): I guess so. Mom says we'll be all right. And they will be, too, as long as you follow instructions. I want to see her now. No, no, no, I do not show you both at the same time. I need to protect myself. AMANDA: Mommy. Here, come here. Are you OK? I'm fine. Daddy's up there. Hello, good to see you. Thank you for being here. Thank you so much. It's a pleasure. Good to see you. Hello, how are you? This is never gonna happen. Here he is. Not a worry in the world. CHAMBERS: Oh, thank you. Thank you for coming. - Go get them. Thank you for being here, buddy. Can't do it without you, you know that. Good morning, everybody. Hello, it's great to see you all. What are you waiting for? CHAMBERS: Good morning, everybody. Joey, oh, so glad you're here. Hi. Great job, everybody. You're waiting too long. Shut up. Wonderful job, everybody. Thank you for all being here. We're gonna have a great rally this morning. Shoot, damn you, shoot! [speaking russian] [gunshot] Stop the land grab. More parks. [gunshots] [gunshots] What's going on? Think I heard shots. [gunshots] [screaming] [gunshot] Yeah, watch his head. Let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go! ALEXI: Come on, move it. AMANDA: No. ALEXI: Now. AMANDA: Mommy. KATHERINE: Amanda. ALEXI: Let's go. Amanda! ALEXI: Help! Help us! Get out of the car. [horn honking] Katherine! KATHERINE: Greg! GREG: Are you all right? They took Amanda. Go, get her. ALEXI: Get in now. GREG: Amanda! Hey! Back up, now. Get down. Whoa! I said down. [horn honking] [screaming] Come on. Come on, hurry, hurry. AMANDA: No, let me go. Stop it. Stop it. Come on, get in here. [screaming] Is there another way out of here? Yes, through the kitchen. Get out of the way. [gunshot] What the hell is going on? [gunshot] [music playing] [gunshot] [gunshot] AMANDA: Daddy! Amanda, are you all right? AMANDA: Daddy! There's no way out, Alexi. Let my daughter go. I have nothing to lose now. Now, you back off. You leave. You get away. Then I let her go. You're not leaving here with my daughter. AMANDA: Daddy! Daddy! Son of a bitch! But that was just a warning. I'll kill her if I have to. You know I will. I see what you're doing, Gregori. It won't work. You don't have the right angle from there. You need a rifle, not a pistol. Now, put the weapon down. Suppose while you think about it, I put my hand over her nose and mouth. Would that help to speed up the process? [gunshot] Daddy. Are you OK? Yeah. All right, stay here Stay here. OK. I love you. I love you. GREG: Come on, let's go find Mommy. Tuck you in. Good night. Love you Love you too, sweetie. I think she's gonna be OK. Yeah. Well, whatever it is, it's over. It is over, isn't it? It is over, yes. You think you can forgive me? I don't know, can I? Well, I know I have a lot of explaining to do. Maybe a whole day's worth. Think you could start in the morning. [MUSIC - ASTRAL PLANE, "PAINTED RAIN"] ASTRAL PLANE: [singing] I've been running from the heat of night for most of my life. Touch of love and your innocence. You're my reason why. I found my future in your arms tonight. Feel the morning light. It haunts me from the truth I hide. You're always by my side. Painted rain. You and I together. Free from pain. No more running forever. Painted rain pours down my window. We are the writers of the show. Running red. Running red. Waves of shadows cross the open sky. There's nothing to feel when you die. What I have lives deep in dreams. You're my reason why. Painted rain. You and I together. Free from pain. No more running forever. Painted rain pours down my window. We are the writers of the show. Running red. Running red. Running red. Running red. Painted rain. You and I together. Free from pain. No more running forever. Painted rain pours down my window. We are the writers of the show.
