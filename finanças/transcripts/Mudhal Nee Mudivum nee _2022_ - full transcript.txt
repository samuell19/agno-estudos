Hey mate, Checkout all the names of the new admissions in our commerce group! Soniya, Hemapriya, Lydia, Catherine... Hey! Seems like names of hot girls for sure. Hey, how do you know that they are hot girls just by looking at their names? If you know that much you won't be the way you are. You'll never get that. 22,23,24... 25! Hey Vinoth, totally we have 25 girls in our class, with 15 new admissions. Okay guys, listen, we all have quite a lot of options. Let's not fight over girls like bloody kids, let's do the decent thing and reserve each one's girl right away. Yeah? I say dibs on Catherine! That's it. I've said it. Which one for you? - For me? Get lost... I have my Rekha, forever. 3 years of sincere relationship mate. Hey! Didn't you hear what our English Miss told us the other day? All this relationship business in 7th and 8th grade is not love, it's just infatuation it seems. But look at us now, we are all matured, we've seen public exams in 10th grade, now we know what life is all about. The love that happens now will be true love. For example, the love I have now for Catherine, that's what I call true love. Hey come on, you don't even know how she looks... You see? That's why it is true love. She's going to look ugly, then you'll know. Your girl will be the ugly one. I'm not the one in love. Don't try to act too big now. Hey! Hey, stop hitting on my head. Hey look, Anu and Rekha are coming back after getting their books. Is that Rekha's mom? Oh yeah, she is a teacher at Vivekananda school. She's super strict it seems. Oh yeah, she's terrible. I did maths tuition with her in 10th standard for two months. Oh. Which girl did you actually go there for? - Shut up. I sincerely went there to learn ma. - Who? You? - Hey... Both of you shut it for a while. What Surendar? You got your books already? Which group have you all picked? All of them are commerce group Ma, except Naushad. Oh... So you've picked science group too? What's your future plan? To study medicine? I'm going to try aunty, it's not that easy. You all have to focus more on studies now, 12th standard decides your life. What? Up until now you all kept saying that 10th standard decides your life? You're absolutely right aunty. 12th standard decides your life. Anu and all these guys are in class 'B' Ma, Naushad and me are in class 'A' Oh yes aunty, I thought I could finally get rid of these guys after 10th standard. But now, again these guys are back on to torture me for another two years. Oh yeah... as if you are from the Royal family and we all can't take our eyes off you. Look at you and your clown specs. Look aunty, this guy keeps calling me names and bullies me all the time. No... This is not the way to behave, okay? You're not supposed to make fun of a person by pointing out their physical features. Huh? How else can we make fun of people then? Oh my God! Ma! Please don't start your lecture. Come, let's go. -Who is this guy? Is he in your class? Hey, come on. - You and your stupid face. Do us a favour and change your mother-in-law. Hey! Don't even say that. I just finally managed to get things moving properly with Rekha. You saw how he was blushing in front of her mother? Look at all that signalling from there now. Well well.. Already you owe 60 bucks for Anandh's shop for all your previous chit-chats. He will literally chop your hand up if you touch his telephone ever again. What do you know? I've already settled around 20 bucks yesterday. So he won't bother me for at least a week. So he says! Try going near his shop, he'll kick you out. You first pay him up for yourself. Hey! Who is that girl? She's super hot. Hey, am I just hallucinating or is she really walking towards us? You're not hallucinating. I think she's really walking towards us. Guys, don't worry. I got this one. You please don't even think of opening your mouth for the next five minutes. Okay? Hi, are you guys from this school? Yes Yes. Which class? Finished tenth. Now going to plus one. Promoted! Oh. I'm Victoria, new admission. Commerce group. Oh! We are all from commerce group too! But I don't remember seeing your name on the new admission list. Oh no, I just got my admission yesterday. So I guess they are yet to update my name on the list. Oh... I'll add it to the list. - Oh yeah. He'll do it. Sorry, I didn't get your names. Chinese... uh no no My real name is.. - Vinoth.. Hi -Naushad... Hi. Su.. - Hi. Durai. - Hello. So where exactly should I get my books from? Oh yeah, you just go straight, you'll reach the Headmistress room, you might experience a tinge of bad smell at that exact point because that's where the primary student's toilet is. Just ignore the smell and walk towards your left, you'll find the sports room. Bang opposite to that is the office room. That's where you can get your books. Oh... It sounds a bit confusing. Can someone come with me? Vinoth? Oh, why not. Let's all go together. What do you say guys? Yeah, let's all go! You guys carry on. - Hey, just come with us. So Victoria, which school did you study last year? Vicky, you can call me Vicky... Actually I was studying at St.Aloysius in Ooty. Have you guys been to Ooty? Oh yeah, we've seen it on TV. Hehe... Okay..what sort of a name is that? Chinese? Oh this one is funny, when we were in class nine he was going out with a Chinese girl for q. He was acting too big and proud to all of us saying that he's dating a foreigner. Naturally, we were also intrigued to see who the foreign girl was. So one fine day we all went to see the girl, only to find out that she's not Chinese but a. She's the daughter of that area's watchman. Our man was dating her thinking she was Chinese all that time. Hah aha... Then? Then what? He dumped her that girl very same day and we gave him the name 'Chinese' Oh... So cute. Hehe... thanks. Oh not you... That chain... really cute. Where did you buy that one? Oh I didn't buy it. It was a gift from a friend. Hmm, nice. Okay, thank you so much for the help. So I guess we'll meet when school re-opens. Bye Vinoth... see you guys.. Guys, I think she has a thing for Vinoth. What? Don't say something just for the heck of it. He's right. I got that vibe too. Did you guys note what she said before she left? Bye Vinoth. See you guysâ€. He is 'Vinoth' and we are all supposed to be some 'guys'. Oh yeah. So what is it now? He's the lead guy and we are all his sidekicks, is it? Listen guys, in our group we don't deal with that kind of rubbish. All of us are equal, yeah? Hey, I'll tell you all something because I'm more experienced than you all when it comes to women and their ways. I got this whole situation dissected and analysed. You know how we all might have looked from her point-of-view? Hmm? Chinese... uh no no My real name is.. - Vinoth.. Hi Naushad... Hi - Su.. Hi -Durai. Hello. This is how it would have been? Hey, what's wrong with this guy? Actually I feel the same way too. Why wasn't my yesterday Just like today? Â€. Why am I not like myself At this very moment? Â€. I wonder if I opened my heart just today? Â€ I wonder if I forgot all my lessons?â€ I wonder if I shed all of my inhibitions?â€. Is this me? Is this really me?â€. The direction I travel towardsâ€. The music that I listen toâ€. Are all born anew when I walk with you!â€. Like the dreams I'm yet to haveâ€. Like the food that I'm yet to tasteâ€. Everything is new when I'm with you!â€. The song that hasn't been refinedâ€. The love that falls like drizzleâ€. Your shoulders like a cradleâ€. And my sleep so far awayâ€. The day the whole country listens to your songâ€. Isn't so far awayâ€. Play as if tomorrow is todayâ€. Just for my earsâ€. Time is your rhythmâ€. Keep playing your tuneâ€ I am your first fanâ€. Play your tune for meâ€. Is this some other world?â€. Is everything here just so beautiful?â€ I see all this beauty just because of you!â€. Just like a long streetâ€. You walk along with meâ€. My whole life seems so new, just because of you!â€. Hey, you've been telling me about joining guitar classes right? What happened to that? Yeah, I still want to join. But there is nothing of that sort in our area. Also, the situation at home is not quite okay. I can't ask for any money for music classes at this point. You know what? If I have a guitar I can just play around with it and learn it myself. Hmmm.. I don't even need a class that way. Not exactly a new one, even a used old guitar is fine. But right now, I can't even afford that. I've completely lost interest in the whole idea of studying, and then going for a job. Just imagine how nice it would be if we start doing something that we are really intereste right from our school days. I think schools abroad might be like that... I don't know why we have to study this stupid commerce and this wretched business maths.. Sheer waste of time. But, only if we study all this we can get through class twelve and then join college and get a degree at least. I don't want a degree and all that. I just want to do music full-time. And travel all over the world to perform. Listen, now it's just a matter of a little time. After school, I'll finish college quickly and get a proper job. So you don't have to worry about a degree or a job or money. You can just make music happily all the way. I'll take care of the rest till you settle down properly with your music. Yeah? Oh my God, it's super late! Did you even watch the film properly? They'll die in the end. Hey idiot, I think you didn't get it. - No you didn't. Mate.. Hello.. Why don't you spit on your deck instead? Hey mate, How have you been? What happened? You said you'll be back in a week. And you come back after a month, you didn't even show up to get your books. Hehe... nothing much. I just happened to hook up with an aunty when I was there. An Aunty?? What? How do you manage to get Aunties all the time? Tsk... Hey.. He's just fooling us. Yeah, right. Will you shut up? You tell me mate. What did you do with her? Crossed third base? Hey! How did you? What do you mean how? Things just fell in place. So yeah. Hey come on, this is not done. You have to narrate the whole thing the way it happened, like a proper story, without missing any detail. Tsk..I'll tell you later when I'm in the mood. Now I have to go to the tailor shop. Oh, I have to go too. Fine, then let's all go. You can tell us the story on our way there. Hey, what about me then? Excuse me. Behave. Please act your age.. Guys, let's go. Hey Chinese, I know how to give this back to you. I'll catch you later. Go on now.. Do some work. Take care of your business. Oh, look at this big man telling me what to do. See you then.. We'll come later to pick up our cycles. Hey! Get lost. I don't care about your cycles. I know you'll be back when you need me again, then you'll see how I deal with you all Hey, what's that noise? Damn with this useless piece of junk!! Vinoth.. Get up..You're late for school.. You can't be late on your first day. Mmm... What's the time like? It's already 8.25... MA! Why didn't you wake me up earlier? What? I've been trying to wake you up since seven in the morning. Oh damn! I'm super late for school! Hey! Hey! It's urgent for me. - No way, I'm late for school. Aren't you having a shower? No Ma, I'm already late. I don't want breakfast either. Oh no, if you don't eat now, you'll feel hungry at class. Just have a quick bite. - Tsk..Ma! I said I don't want to. Just leave it. Ma! What's this?! On the collar? It's holy ash. This is a new dress right? So I did some prayers for you and smeared a bit of ash on the collar. Come on, you can't even spot it, it's so small. You're saying you can't spot this? It makes my shirt look horrible. Don't use that tone when it comes to matters of God..Come on, have some food. Ma! Don't irritate.. I'm already running late. Bye Vinoth, take care. Srivatsav. - Present miss. Hey mate. Please let me in! Thirumal. - Present miss. Victoria Fernandes. - Present miss. B.Vinoth Kumar. - Present Miss. What man? Showing up late on the very first day? Sorry Miss, my cycle Tyre was flat. Lie! Lie! Go sit. Vincent Raj. - Present Miss. Let me guess. You overslept? - Yeah mate, woke up super late. Is Juliet Miss our Business Maths teacher for this year? Hehe... Not for just Maths, she is our class teacher. Oh damn. We're dead then. Gayathri, today is the last date to collect notebooks. Inform everybody. Yes Miss. I've done that. Hey Bomboy you let one rip again? Hey! It wasn't me! Vinoth! What's happening there? Stand up! What mate? - You also. What mate? It's just the first day and both of you have started your shenanigans already? Enough of all your monkeyshines all these years, now you both better get serious. Look at how you can study well this year and score something decent in your final exams. If not, that's it, your life is over, understand? Excuse me Miss? Oh, please come in Miss... Have you met Father already? Oh yes, just a while ago. Sorry Miss, I got a bit held up with some formalities. Oh... no problem at all. I've already finished the attendance part. You can carry on with your class. Hey who's that? New admission? All the best.. - Thanks. All of them are actually nice kids, but some of them are too playful. So make sure you enforce yourself as a strict teacher right from the beginning and keep them under your control. She's wearing a saree? - I think she's a teacher. OK students, This is Priya Miss, she'll be teaching Computer Science and Commerce for you all. 'Good morning miss' She has just joined our school this year. So behave yourselves... Okay? Okay Miss, I'll let you take it from here. - Okay Miss. Miss..Strict..mmm? Okay. Okay. Sit down... Okay students, My name is Priya. I'll get to know all your names as we go along. I'm not sure how other teachers operate here, but I don't believe in an authoritarian approach. I also don't believe in hitting or yelling at students. I think if you enjoy your time in class then you'll also enjoy the lessons you learn. That's pretty much my philosophy. Why are you all sitting like posing for a picture? Did you all get me? 'Yes miss' That's better. And, one more thing. It's absurd to have girls and boys sitting separately in a Co-Ed school. Shuffle up so that we can start some lessons. I said mix up so that we can start the class. Mix up? Hmm... Lavanya! I'm coming to you. I'm next to Catherine. So that's the law of motion understood? Rekha, You get it right? Yes miss. - What? You're dreaming huh? Hey Catherine, It's the last day to collect the notebooks. Make sure you get it, okay? - I know that, mind your own business. It's my duty as the class leader to inform you. I don't give a damn. Listen, are you going to give it to me right now or should I tell everyone about that time in sixth standard when you pooped in your pants. Hey, you just can't keep blackmailing me with that same old story. I think everybody knows about it now. Get lost! Oh, like that? I don't think the new admissions girls know about it. I'll tell them then. Don't bother. Hey no, wait. Hey it's absolutely fine. You can have it. I'll just go tell them and then see you. Here. At least leave half of the egg for me. That's more like it. Guys, come on. Dig in. Hey whose is this? Dumb Su's? - Hmm. You guys are absolutely jobless! All these years we've been eating his lunch almost every single day, but this guy doesn't seem to lose any weight at all. I think he has a back-up lunch box that he hides from us and eats that during lunch. I'll find that one too. Hey Chinese, Catherine is here. Try and talk to her and make a nice impression. This is your chance. Oh damn! What will I say? I'm blanking out all of a sudden. You are all gabby with us all the time right? Go, do the same thing to her. Go on! No way.. I'm a bit nervous. - Go! Catherine! Do you want to eat an egg? What? - Egg Catherine... Egg! Egg! Yuck! Disgusting. Hey, what's disgusting? I think she's impressed. What do you think guys? Absolute waste. Hey, why did you offer her? I gave the egg only for you to eat. So what now? Hey! Hey! You know we have a new Miss. She seems super cool. Yeah I know.. Priya Miss right? Anu just told me. Hey you know what? Physics this year seems to be super complicated, I have no clue what's happening. You guys are all lucky, with all easy subjects. Says who? Business Maths is super tough for us. Hmm.. Hey Vinoth, I feel a bit weird, both of us being in different classes. After all these years of studying in the same class together, this somehow doesn't feel right for me... don't you feel that way too? Hmmm. Who is that? Oh her. That's Vicky..uh..Victoria. Oh, so that's the new Anglo-Indian girl? Anyway, what was I saying? Remind me? Uh... What were you saying... hmm... ah, you were saying about buying some new jeans instead of the usual traditional clothes that. So, where are you going to buy it? Hey... okay..okay..I was just pulling your leg. You were saying that Physics is tough, you feel weird about sitting in a different class. Right? I'll take care of you later. Oh yeah? I think jeans won't work for you. Just stick to your traditional clothes..hah aha. You're going to get whacked from me later. Bye Rekha. Why are you waving as if you're leaving town. Silence! I said silence! OK listen, Tomorrow we don't have our usual classes. Instead, we have a health check-up scheduled, followed by a seminar. But attendance is compulsory. Okay? What seminar Miss? - Hmm... You'll know that tomorrow. What's this all about? Health check-up and all that. I don't get it. Listen, it's only for humans. Don't try to bring your cows over for a free health check up. Hey! I've already told you a million times not to talk about my cows. Hey idiot! I've told you a million times not to point the compass at me. Tap it three times on the floor. No. Come on, do it. - No way. Listen guys, we have half-a-day leave tomorrow. It's been a while since we saw some porn. I'll bring my VCR deck from home, we'll rent a video cassette from Lakshmi videos. What do you guys say? Hey! Super! But they don't lend us porn cassettes. Do you remember the last time? The guy at the shop threatened us that he'll inform our par. Hey, why are you freaking out now. If you're over fifteen you can rent porn cassettes. Do you know that? I'll take care of this. Actually it will be nice to watch porn here. Good morning Father. Good morning boys, sit down... Do you all have any idea why we are here? For a prayer meeting father? Hah aha... no. We have gathered here for a Sex education seminar. Yay! Guys, they're going to show us some porn. Now, I'm going to explain about some really important things for your life. Okay? Damn, why are they showing their backs? What is this? Father! Main point father! What? Main point? So I believe you have understood everything I said. Remember these points students. These are really important facts in your life. OK father. Okay, if you have any questions or doubts you are free to ask now. Hey, ask him about that. Hey Chinese, ask him about that. Father. I have a doubt Father. Yes, go on... One drop of blood equal to hundred.. Tsk.. One drop of sperm is equal to hundred drops of blood. Is this true? What?! Not at all. Hey, you won't die then. Phew... That Father was just brilliant. He told us some amazing things. We'll tell you later about that, we have to leave now. Have some important work to take care of. What work? Begging for cassettes from that Lakshmi videos guy. Get lost! If there is one person who knows us well, then that's you. Guys, let's go. Go on.. I'm sure the power will be off in your place. No way. I think the power is going to be off in your shop now. Get lost. Hey idiot, get lost. See you later. These guys are just spoiled to the core. Bloody porn addicts. But whatever happens, we both will always be mates. Oh I'm your mate now? I'm sure you have a scheme. What do you want? Nothing much... Just a couple of batteries... Hehe..Show me the money. So it's all about money then. - Yes, it is. What about our friendship then? Hey! When did we even become friends? You guys keep taking everything you want on credit. That's it, from here on, if you want something you better pay up and get it. Listen, Rekha is already here, please don't ruin everything. Just two batteries please. This will be the last time. You guys are such a pain in the damn neck. Let this be the last time. Here... Get lost now! Thanks mate. I know, you were just trying to pull my leg. What? Pulling your leg? Next time you ask me something for credit I'll kill you! Hey, it looked like he was yelling at you. Was he? Hehe... Not at all. He was just playing around with me. Oh. Here... Hey! Thanks da. Did you bring your Walk-man? Not just the Walkman, but also two new batteries. So we can hear songs for quite a long time. Hey super! Let's hear our song first then. - Hmm. Here. Hey, why don't you just put it in the Walkman and rewind it? Oh no.. That will eat up too much battery. If you want to listen for a longer time then this is the best way. Hmmm.. You know I just can't wait to finish school and get into college. Oh yeah? Why? Because college won't be as strict as our school, we can bunk classes, we can meet anytime we want to. But look at us now.. Too many rules, too many conditions. It's such a task for us to even hangout for a while. Yeah..that's true. But all our friends might join different colleges. I wonder if it will be as much fun as now. Tsk.. I'm pretty sure we'll always have fun. Just like now, sharing our headphones and listening to our favourite songs. The only difference is that now we are listening to A.R.Rahman's songs, but in a few years we will be listening to your song. Yeah? The first song that I write will be for you. Hey! Is that it? Come on Rekha. One more time please? You saw how they kissed in Titanic right? Please, just one more time? Huh? All that only after we finish school. Now I realise it's better to finish school soon then. You've been doing random dirty things with the boys and getting spoiled. Hey... I don't hangout with them that much. Don't tell me stories. Once we're done you'll be off to meet them straight. I know. Hey idiot! What are you doing sitting here? Oh no.. I was watching it all this while. - Bloody idiot. Surendraa... Oh damn! It's my mom. Quickly switch it off and pull the cassette out. Surendraa... Hey, open all the windows and doors. What are you doing? Open the door... Yeah yeah.. Coming mom! Hey, the cassette is stuck inside. Just unplug the power cable then. - Okay. All good? - Yeah. What happened? You're back early today? Actually our General Manager retired from service today, we had a small send off party for. But I left halfway through. Move out of the way now. I'm super tired. Oh... Everyone's here. You all seem to be surprisingly quiet today. Hehe... we were just talking softly. OK aunty, we'll get going then. It's late. Bye Su. Okay boys. Bye. Hey Surendar, did someone come for the electricity bill estimate? Yeah, they came round this aternoon. Oh okay, how much is it this month? Tsk.. That's so irresponsible, you didn't even check how much it is? Bring the card now, I I don't know when you're going to learn to take up some responsibility. I'm sure the bill will be high this month because of the new washing machine. Here Ma. What the hell is this? What rubbish you're up to? So this is what you do at home everyday? It's nothing Ma, it's just a science project! It's just science Ma! Hey, you can't even pass the ball properly? Hey listen mate, this is the right time. Catherine is alone. Just walk up to her and say it. Oh damn..I'm scared. I think I'll practice my lines properly and then propose to her tomorrow. Look mate, the more you delay, the more dangerous it is for you. Someone else is going to take advantage of that and get her. You and your foul mouth! Why did you jinx it? Better take back whatever you said now. Okay okay, I'm sorry. I take back whatever I said. Okay, don't think I'm jinxing it again. I have a feeling Richard has an eye on Catherine. Richard? Did he tell you? Yeah... sort of.. Oh damn.. Then it's a clear danger then. I'll propose to her right away. Hey Catherine, I have to tell you something. Yeah, go on. How did you even get interested in basketball? I love you. You started playing as a kid or what? Everyone plays the game in my family, so I was interested too. Hey... Nice goal. I also clearly heard the other thing you said. So.. You love me? Hmm... Seriously? Very seriously, I swear on my mom. Hmmm.. That's nice to know. But I have a certain taste. I don't fancy these kinds of normal proposals. Oh..So what do you fancy? You have to propose like Superman. Like Superman? How? Hey look at this guy. He's gone nuts! What's wrong with him? Look at the color of it. Hey Catherine. Finally! His underwear gets a wash! To start the program, we have to press.. I think in a few years we'll be able to watch porn on these. Hey, what is this? Computer. You've typed in something else instead of the program. Oh no, Chinese was trying to show us something. Oh God... How will you get the answer this way? You have to type it in a BASIC Language format. - Oh.. Excuse me miss. - Come. Hey Vinoth, what do you put for your hair? Any hair gel? Did Juliet Miss go through the circular? It's really soft... I like it. Rekha... - Ah, yes miss? I asked you if Juliet Miss had a look at the circular. Yes Miss. She did.. OK, tell her that I'll see her after this class. OK Miss. Don't even try to touch Srivats' head like you're doing now, he'll freak out. Oh is it? I'll try it sometime. Hey Rekha? Hey? Hey, come out! Hold on. We're coming. Hey Vinoth! Hey, you said there was some issue in the area and we had to meet someone? I don't see anyone here. Tsk... I'll tell you mate. What's up with you? You're acting strange. Tsk... This is the thing. Housing Board Kumar asked us to come here, but on the way I bumped into Saara Sasi. And he said it's better to meet somewhere else. Where? At the ground. So I went there... HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! Hey! What's all this? I'll explain later. You first cut the cake. Hold this. Here Anu. It's quite nice. - Here mate. Here you go Vinoth. Hey what's this? A Guitar? Yeah, my gift. Go on, open it. The exact same guitar we saw at the shop! This is awesome. I know right. Hey! Why did you play it first? - So what? That's it, everything is ruined. It must've been expensive... how did you even get it? Why do you worry about that? Just tell me if you like it or not? What are you saying? This is my dream guitar. Okay, play something for me now. Oh, I'm not that fluent yet. Hey, the other day you played John's guitar at his house right? That, I was just messing around. Come on don't make a huge fuss now. Play whatever you know. Okay okay fine, I'll play something. Let me tune the guitar first. Tune it? So it's like a radio then. Tuning seems pretty easy for me. Okay, what should I play? Hey, play the song 'Ilaya Nila' for us. Oh yeah, that's a great song for guitar. Go for it. 'Ilaya Nila'... C... E... G. Why is he singing alphabets? I can't play the whole thing. I'll play as much as I know. Yeah? Hey, is it the same song? Hang on, he'll get there. This is a proper guitar right? Shut up. Hey! How was it? It was brilliant. - What do you think Anu? Oh yeah. Super. All that's fine mate, but you said you'll play 'Ilaya Nila' right? When are you planning to play that? Hold this for a minute. I told you I can't play properly, didn't I? Hey! Who is there? Oh damn! It's the watchman. Run! Get the Guitar Cover. Run! Run! All of you stop right there! - Hey what about the cake... Hey idiot, leave that and run. Hey Richard, let's get Chinese to play as striker today. No way, I'll play as striker. Richie. Look. Hey Wuss. What are you thinking about? Go on, change. No it's okay, I'll change after you all change and leave. Huh? After we leave? Why? Are we girls or what? Change now. Oh not like that, I'll change after you all leave. Hey mate, leave him alone. He'll change and come. Let's go. Hey, hold on. What's all this fuss? He won't take off his shirt in front of us, is it? Hey, come on take it off. I said take it off! Richard, please let go of my shirt. Let him go. - You stay out of this. If you don't, I'll rip it part. Please Richard, I'll change and come. I swear. Hey! Give me back my bus pass... Richard! - Come, let's go. Hey give it back, please. Mate, just give it to him. Poor guy, how will he get back home today? Huh? Let him buy a ticket. I didn't bring any money today. Please Richard. Now he won't join us for the game. So what? Hey fraudster! Come on. You play in defence instead of Francis for this match. It's okay if I'm not in the game but please give me back my bus pass. Sorry wuss... Sorry. Please tell him Durai. Richard! Please Richard! Pass it to me Richard! Here. Get in! Hey Vinoth! You fluffed your lines again! Here Vinoth. Make a run! One-Two! One-Two! Hey Vinoth blew it again. One-Two it seems. My foot! Sorry mate. Get back! Get back! Clear the ball. Goal! Goal! That was just shambolic. We couldn't even score a goal. I think all you guys played well, but you lost it because of Vinoth. From now on stop all the wandering about and just focus on practicing. If not, I'll kill you all. I didn't get one proper pass in the whole game. Oh look who's talking... You kept calling for a one-two pass and missed every single one of. That's what happens if you don't show up for training and spend all your time romancing. Let's watch Titanic Rekha? Let's have Ice cream Rekha? Why are you getting all worked up now? You bloody dog! Hey... hey... you missed it again. Now run run... get it. Go and get the ball now. I'm going to rip you apart now! Oh yeah right. Let's see that. Next time show all this force in the game mate! Doesn't lift a finger during the match but now he's all pumped up with us. Hey mate, you don't fret on it. Just drop it. Hi Vinoth. - Hey Vicky, why are you practicing alone? Oh these girls are absolutely useless. They play for five minutes and get tired. Then they just sit and gossip all the way. But you can improve your game only if you play with someone right? So you come on then, let's play. Me? With you? Why? Are you the sort of guy who thinks it's a disgrace to play with a girl? Hey, no way! Then you might be scared of losing to a girl. Huh? Scared? Yeah Hey guys! Here! Come on. - Here. Hey Su, where is Vinoth? Oh he's bored of playing with us, so he's gone to play with Vicky now. Look at it. Hey! You're an absolute idiot! Hey mate, I was just joking. I'll kick you now. Vinoth! Hey Rekha, what's up? What the hell are you doing with her? Rekha, keep it down, all the teachers are around. Why is she overreacting? Rekha! Hey Rekha, what happened to you? I said I'm sorry. Leave me alone Francis. Your bus pass. Richard asked me to give it to you. Photo? It's over there... Come with me. I'll show you. Oh look at him. This is too funny. There's your photo. Richard put it up there. Actually his photo works well for this poster. Richard got it right this time. Hey Richard, why do you torture that poor guy all the time? Listen... I was just pulling his leg. All of you lost your sense of humour or what? You guys are creating this whole sympathy wave and making me feel like the bad guy. He doesn't want to be a part of the Football team from now on. Hey, he'll come. If not we'll ask someone else to step in for him. Simple. Hey Vinoth, I heard you had a fallout with your lover? Can you just mind your own business? What did I say? - Just drop it. Richard, can I borrow your motorbike for a bit please? I'm about to leave now mate. It will just be ten minutes, I'll be back quickly. Please mate. I'll come along? No it's fine. Go easy on the bike mate. - Okay. Rekha, I'm sorry. How many more times should I say it? She kept saying things like 'I'm scared of losing to her' and she was acting too smart. That's why I played with her to prove a point. I truly have no other intentions otherwise. But I clearly know what her intentions are with you. Catherine told me all about her. What can I do if she has other intentions? Is that my fault too? You act in a way that encourages her. That's your fault. Can you please stop moving and talk for a bit? I can't push the bike anymore. Listen Vinoth. There is no right or wrong in this whole thing. If I really like someone then I'll make sure I don't behave in a way that hurts them. That's me. If I was doing the same thing with Richard or Durai, will you be cool with it? -Huh? Tell me... You feel weird right? Now you get it? OK, I was just being insensitive and did a stupid thing. From now on, I won't do anything that might hurt you. I swear, I swear on my music. Oh... So you think I'll believe you if you just swear on your music? You will. I know you. Okay fine, can we please get back to normal mode? Give me a smile at least. Hey mate, why are you fighting with a nice girl? Better compromise. Hey! I know how nice she is! Can you drive fast like that? Not exactly, but I can try. When are you taking me for a ride? Let's go now! Now? What will I do with my cycle? Just leave it somewhere here for now. No one will be interested to nick your cycle. When did you learn to drive a gear bike? Just recently. I thought I'll surprise you with the bike on valentines day and take you fo. But I've blown all those plans now. Hey don't do any of those wheeling stunts, okay? Yeah right, as if I know all that. Oh they were overdoing the warm-ups. Hey Chinese, come let's buy some biscuits. Oh yeah. I need to buy some toffees too. Look at this dumbo, the first thing he buys on a zonals day is toffees. How can we ever win something with this guy around? Toffees are rich in vitamin-C. What do you know? Two butter biscuits please. - And I'll take some tofees. What's up with all that crowd there? Oh that one... This film actress Kushpu is coming today to inaugurate that hotel it seems. What? Kushpu? Oh, it's just Kushpu... Simran would've been great... Excuse me, What's so great about Simran? She has just acted in a couple of movies. Kushpu is the all-time favourite. For me it's Simran. Hey, move it. What rubbish is he talking about? Kushpu debuted in '88. It's been ten years now and she's still on top of her game. What time is she coming? That I don't have a clue. Oh okay. Thanks mate. Hey, you anyway have nothing to do right? Just keep an eye on this hotel. Let us know when Kushpu is here. Yeah? Sure mate. Here mate, want some? Just get away from me. Boys, do your warm-ups well. You guys have to win this one somehow. Here you go Chinese. - What's this? Glucon-C, for energy. Save some for me too mate. - Also for me. Hey, you've been eating bloody junk since morning, why the hell do you need Glucon-C for? I feel like all the food is blocking my food pipe. This should help digest it better right? You better get lost before I beat you to death... Just get out of my sight... run away.. What? I said get lost.. Mind your own business. - Go! Leave now! Idiot. Alright break it up. Start warming up. I am going to spit on your face one of these days. Start warming up. Mates, we can do this right? Hey! We will win this hundred metres. - Okay, go on now. We'll win this. The guy standing next to you is last year's winner, Don't let him get past you. Mate!!! Kushpu is here! Come on! Kushpu!!! - Yay! Come on mates, let's make it before she leaves. I just saw her for a bit. She looks absolutely gorgeous. And you trusted these guys? Sir... Kushpu has arrived! Look at that fool. He's acting too smart. He'll get kicked this evening for sure. I'm going to kill him. Hey.. Hi! You and your stupid face! Anyway... What's the plan for Valentine's day? I've asked Richard to lend me his bike for a day. He said he will. If that works out then I can absolutely rock it. Hey, one more thing. Does your tape recorder work properly? Yes it does. Why? I need it for something. Can you bring it home this evening? Yeah, sure. Oh damn... Hey, what are you doing? Hold on, I'll tell you. Okay, just hit record on your set when I tell you. Yeah? Hey... I have no clue what you're up to? You'll get it if you just shut up and watch. Hi Rekha.. This one's for you. Happy Valentines day. Ilaya nila... â€. Aaah! Is this your gift? Yeah, what do you think? Nice one. Okay listen, it will burn a bit initially, but it will be alright after a while. Hey, hold his hand. Just a second mate, make sure the 'C' is clearly visible, yeah? Okay I got that, you just stay still now. Ah! Catherine! Catherine! Catherine! Hey Vinoth, how did this whole thing of wearing green shirt on Valentine's Day start? That trend must've started somewhere abroad. So our boys are wandering about wearing green shirts too. Hehe... Total crackpots... Anyway, can we sit here? - Yeah, sure. Hey, what is my gift? I'm too curious now. Oh yeah. Here. Hey! Thanks da! This is just a starter. Main gift is something else. What's it? Close your eyes, I'll tell you. Why? Come on, close your eyes. I'll tell you. Listen... Don't take advantage of this and try to kiss me or something. I'll kick you. Oh, that sounds like a nice idea too... Hey... what are you doing? Hey! Did you play it? Hey! It sounds brilliant! It almost sounds like two guys playing. How did you do this? That's the technique... How long did it take to practice this? I've just been practicing this ever since you got me the guitar. Ilaya Nila! Haha... Where is that idiot? Hey Catherine... Hm? What's this? Did you get hurt or what? 'C' for Catherine. I got it done with acid. You have no idea how painful it was. Then why did you do it? Just to show you how serious I am with this whole thing. I love you. Fine... You've already told me this a million times. So what do you want to do? I want you to love me too. Okay, give me ten reasons why you love me. Your eyes, Your eyebrows. Stop, are you going to name ten body parts? No. What about your shoes? Does it count? I don't understand how your mind works, you creep me out. Creep is not all that bad. Just somehow try and love me please. Okay.. Give me ten reasons why I should love you? Oh that's easy. There's Umm.. Oh no. Umm.. Catherine, please consider me. I've already told my friends that you're in love with me too. So try and love me please. Your face just irritates me. Take a look at the mirror and you'll know what I'm talking about. You absolutely disgust me. Hey mate, so she said yes? She said that my face irritates her. Fairplay. What? What?...That's too bad mate. After all the acid and the pain, everything is a huge waste now. Hey, where is Naushad? Aah! Hey, don't just pretend, I haven't even started.. No idiot! You are holding the place where you put it last time. Oh... sorry sorry.. Okay, so you want me to make this 'C' into an 'S' right? Yeah, but just make it look natural. Listen mate, this is not my profession. - Okay, Okay I'll do as much as I can. - Okay alright. Hey hey! One second, hold on! - Hey idiot! What happened? Mate... just give it a nice thought if you are sure about Soniya? I've thought about it, why? Look, Soniya is a Marwari girl, so they don't cook meat in their house. In the future it might be hard for you to cope. Oh... I did not think of that angle. So they don't even cook eggs, is it? Nope... Nothing, just bread and vegetable curry everyday. Oh... Mate... Then make the 'C' into a 'G' Why 'G'? Hey Gayatri. Hm? What? 'G' for Gayatri. I love you. What's this...? Did you get hurt or what...? Oh... Catherine told you? Not just to me, but to all the girls in Section 'A', seniors, juniors, Even the cleaning lady knows about it. Just to clarify, Catherine's cycle is that red color Ladybird right? Yeah... Why? What arrogance! Can't even bear to look at my face it seems. That's not even a valid excuse for not loving me. Hmm... Yeah mate. I hate to see your face too, but I still hangout with you right? Hmm... Mate, stuff some inside the bell. Let's see how you ring the bell from now on. - Hehe. Phew... This smell is unbearable. Mate... I can't hold it anymore, let's do our spray painting. But all the acid and the pain is still a waste mate. No it's not. I've decided to propose to Gowri in the tuition this evening. I heard even Gowri rejected you? Yeah mate, I've literally proposed to every single girl that I know of. You could have just dated that Chinese girl. Mate, she's not Chinese.. She's Nepali. Hehe... Oh yeah Nepali. For what? You'll keep pulling my leg all my life with that. That's a given no matter what. Okay, we're already late. Let's leave then? Where are you guys off to? Wedding Reception. Guys... You both just got caught eating in some random reception last week right? You still haven't stopped this racket? That was a different area mate, we've changed our zone now. Hey, that's enough, let's go. You both are just shameless to the core. Bye mate. - Please leave and never come back. So the solution is X1 is equal to determinant. A1 by determinant A. X2 is equal to determinant A2... Anu said we should think about joining her tution. I heard they teach really well. We'll join there? If I join an evening tution then I won't be able to meet Rekha... I don't think I can join. But you go ahead if you want to. I'll see if I can join you next month maybe... Vinoth! Idiot! I'm teaching a very important theorem here and you're happily chatting away? You just have a few months left now and you'll be sitting in your final exams in a blink-o. When are you planning to come to your senses? Your parents work their socks off to pay your fees and you sit here and fool around like a useless piece of junk! Anyway, what are you planning to do after twelfth Sir? Music? Yes Miss, I'm fully interested in music. Hmmm... I'm quite confident that you are capable enough to become a great musician. But, in middle class families like ours, parents just freak out when they hear these sort of things from kids. So just get a degree just for their sake. Hm... Thanks Miss. Anyway... Is there a farewell party this year? Juliet Miss told us that she'll speak to our Headmistress about it. Hmmm... Okay. So I spoke to our HM about a farewell party. But she said that in our school we don't have this tradition of farewell parties, plus, there is only a small gap between the second revision exams and the final exams. So she felt this farewell party might be an unnecessary distraction and said 'no' for it. Damn! I curse her to get diarrhea! - We all hate HM! Hey, she can't hear me in this noise. - Watchout mate, she might hear it. Okay okay!...Silence! I said silence ..HM is a... So she said no, but Priya Miss and me tried really hard and convinced her to finally say y. So we are having a farewell party this year. Yay! Hey! I'm going to kick everyone's arse! Hey! PT Master is a jerky jerk! Surendar! Get up! Get out and kneel down! Hey what man? How do you all manage to become silent only when I speak? Sorry miss. I can't stand this nonsense! Get out and kneel down I say! Get out now! Get out mate. You didn't hear it? What is this Su? Okay listen, we had to convince her hard to get this permission. So you all have to promise me two things. One, that you will all do well in the upcoming second revision exams. That we can't. Two, you should all make sure you are in your best behaviour on our farewell day... Agreed? Okay miss. I too promise Miss. Idiot. As time gently flies away with the windâ€. As we go on, our wishes lay clumped togetherâ€. The sky will open up just for usâ€. To bring unfathomable dreams to life... â€. As the crescent of our lives growâ€. Fill the heart to its brim with friendshipâ€. Call me when you stumbleâ€ I'll always be thereâ€. As we fall when we play, some experiences become scarsâ€. Our dear friendship rushes to embrace and heal the woundsâ€. I feel the sweetness at the bottom of my heart whenever we come togetherâ€. Even if we part ways, the love in our hearts will never diminishâ€. In the time of dreamsâ€. The friends that gave a shoulderâ€. The light of the stars that shine through timeâ€. Are little fireflies like usâ€. Hey Catherine, What's up? Why aren't you wearing a saree? Hey she doesn't know how to tie a saree... Madam Jayalakshmi... Are we all grandmothers, to wear a damn saree? All of you look absolutely funny and stupid in this. Hey Thirumal, come on click a picture for us. Yeah sure Come on guys. Rekha.. - Right here. How do I look in this Saree? - Super! Just the top looks a bit funny right? Oh no..Looks fine for me. Welcome to our farewell party for our outgoing students of this year. Now our father will inaugurate the event by lighting the lamp followed by a prayer. Almighty heavenly father, as we say farewell to our beloved students of this 1999 batch... Thank God... Finally, I have some company. Our class girls look like they just came straight out of an old age home or something. Exactly my point, Isn't it super funny? I can't believe it.. ...and truth to be behind them, Pushing them onwards into your goodness, we know that you will.. Hey, should we just go and set-up our stuff? Yeah makes sense, let's go. Hey, let's go. Where to? ...and happiness throughout their life and all their endeavours. You bless them abundantly to all students, Amen. Now, we'll start our program with a welcome dance by Gayathri. Oh damn... Not this song again! Hey mate, I'm hungry. Should we check out the snacks counter? Yeah, let's go. Where are you off to? - Just come. Hey, don't overdo it and make me look like a ghost. You'll always need a little extra make-up for the stage. Leave this to me. Okay then. Mate... can I have one more please? Hey... hold on. Each one gets one. That's it. Actually Master, Chinese is down with a stomach upset, so he asked me to have his share too. Oh I see... Give him another one then. But from here on, each one gets one. Got it? Okay Sir. - Okay, clear now. You're dead. What's rum like? Oh that's way too strong. Beer is always better for beginners. Oh okay then. Hey, how many have we got? - There's twelve in here. Isn't it a bit much? Sorry mate, Cheapskate! Here. Cheers. Damn! Why is it so bitter? Oh yeah. Look at his stupid face... bloody annoying. Hey suck up! Get lost! Hey, what are you doing? Shut it. Hey, go bring Francis. Hang on. Go now! So I hope you're all enjoying the party, next we have a fashion show. Hey!! Srivats!! There he comes. Come on mate!! Hey. Look at him! Wow, he knows how to turn on stage! Can you even see us with those shades on? Hey Srivats, your fly is open! Shut that first! Why did you guys call me? I asked him to bring you. Sit down, I'll tell you. Listen mate, I know that over the years I've tortured you a lot. But now, our time in school is almost over. I'm not sure when we'll meet next. So I thought I should apologise to you. Sorry mate. Hey come on, it's fine. I didn't take it personally. Thanks mate. That's okay. Hey Durai. Hey... no thanks. I'm not used to it. What do you think? We've been drinking all our lives or what? This is just for some fun. Here. No, no, I don't want it. See mate, after all this time we've become proper friends only now. We'll be friends, that's fine. But not this. This is just for some fun mate. Hmmm... here... I'm having it just for a taste too. Let him be. Drink it. Don't force him to drink it. Here, At least hold the bottle. Now he'll drink it. Cheers! Hey! We need Vats back on stage. Vats!! Oh look at this loser on stage. Hey! Get lost now! Somebody please chase this guy out! Get lost and don't ever come back. Hey! Why are you wasting it? Give it to me if you don't want it. Let them perform in peace, leave them. One, Two, Three, Four.. Hey Anu, is this right? Boys and girls, is everyone ready to go? We're right next after the fashion show. So, before you go on stage just revise your steps with your partners. And listen, just enjoy your performance. All the best guys. Thank you Miss. - Yes Miss. It's all good right? Initially I told you that it was slightly bitter right? But now it tastes good mate. Tastes good is it? Hmm? Initially it was a bit bitter, but it's nice. Hehehe... So you like it. That's alright... take off your shirt. Huh? - I said take off your shirt. Why? - Just for fun... OK, he's thinking too much. Guys, just hold him... let's take it off. Richard... please... let me go. Please. Please Richard! So, you won't take off your shirt in front of us right? Hehe... How's it? I've never ever lost a bet in my life. See, I finally made him remove his shirt. Richard please give me back my shirt. Oh great, this is the perfect song. Why are you crying now? Just do a catwalk now. Come on. Hey! Who is that there? Hey it's PT master! Run! Run! Stop right there! Don't run! Hey Francis! What are you doing here? What's all this? I don't know anything about this master, it's Richard... You first wear your shirt. Let's go to Juliet Miss. Please Sir. It wasn't my fault. It was them... Now, we have a western dance performance. Mate play that 'Daeliâ€. Huh? What? The first song on side A. Hey! Come on Chinese! Rock it! Hey Anu! Come on guys let's whistle! Anu! Come on Anu! Hey Bomboy! Get lost! Look at his face. Hey Anu! It was brilliant! Hey Chinese, you absolutely rocked it. Hey, I have no clue what I just did. The moment I got on stage, I just forgot all the steps, then I just did something that came to my head. No seriously, it was brilliant guys. You both were actually the highlight, you know? You both always used to fight like cat and dog. It's unbelievable how you even managed to pull this off. I don't even get it. Rekha... I have to tell you something. What? For quite some time both of us have been... Hey, you tell her. Have been...? Tell her... We both have been seeing each other for a while now. Hey! What are you saying! Really? How long? Yeah. Ever since the time he joined my tuition. Oh my God! You've kept it a secret all this while? Very smart! Hey, not really, we didn't mean to keep it a secret. But we thought you all will pull our leg and make fun of us if you get to know of this. You didn't even tell me.. Hey, I need to pee. You're coming? Mate, if we leave this here and go now, someone will nick it. Oh yeah... Then keep an eye on mine too. I'll be back. I had a feeling this might happen.. Hey, even Vinoth doesn't know yet. Oh, he will be the happiest person if he gets to know this. You know what, I'm going to find him now, I can't wait to tell him this. Hey, wait hold on. Next we have an English play written by William Shakespeare. Hey Vinoth, just a small favour. Can you come inside please? Yeah. Hey Su, where is Vinoth? Gone for a pee. Oh... Okay. Hey, Don't touch that! I've been searching for this box for quite a while. Oh... it's super dusty... Aah! - Hey, I am sorry. Tsk... I got some on my eyes. Oh... I'm sorry... Can you please see if it's gone? Vinoth!!! Damn! Rekha, Hey Rekha, wait a second, just listen to me. You have no clue what happened over there. It's not what it looked like. I'm not a kid Vinoth, I saw what happened there. Oh damn... I didn't do anything... It was her.. Stop it Vinoth, don't say another word. I feel so cheap to even talk about it. I could totally see this coming. That's why I kept telling you over and over again that she's a bit of a loose girl and you have to stay away from her. Listen, ever since I promised you, I even stopped talking to her. Oh damn, I don't know how to even start explaining this... She wanted me to help her bring the box down from the cupboard. I didn't expect her to misbehave like that all of a sudden. Please try to understand, don't act like one of those regular girls. Oh yeah, I'm a regular girl. I don't know how to dress up stylish like her, I can't speak English like her, I can't kiss like her... If you only fancy a girl like her... then go on. I won't be in your way. Hey! What are you even talking about? You think that's what I'm after? Idiot! Yeah, I'm an idiot. For making you my world and my everything, I'm the biggest idiot around. Go on, go around kissing her however you feel like. That's what you fancy right? What? You don't believe me right? So that's how much you know me right? I don't need this... I don't need a relationship without trust. In the future, you won't believe me for any damn thing. I can't live like that. Oh... very good. You made a terrible mistake, and instead of apologising, you are dumping me? Oh damn... It wasn't my mistake. I'll explain the whole thing again clearly, please be patient and listen to me. Why should I listen to you Vinoth? You've already said that you don't need this relationship right? So it's all over then. Bye... Don't crumble, my heartâ€. Don't leave me at this momentâ€. You brought me to this heightâ€. As I flew in the skyâ€. Living like a cloudâ€. Only to break like a teardrop... â€. Don't crumble, my heartâ€. Don't crumble, my heartâ€. Don't make a mistake, my heartâ€. Questions that burn upside downâ€ I see thousands of themâ€ I ask for answersâ€. But you break into piecesâ€. Don't crumble, my heartâ€. Is it my mistake or yours?â€. My heart stands still without an answerâ€. All over the wall of my heartâ€. You drew lines as you smiled and adoredâ€. Then you told me it's not art but just a scribbleâ€. As the scribble crackedâ€. And your paint brush burntâ€. The smoke filled the skyâ€. And turned my dreams into ashesâ€. Hold for me - my dear timeâ€. You seem to be in a rush to abandon meâ€. I'll start all over again with the prologueâ€. Or I'll try to write the epilogue... â€. Just go and apologise Vinoth. Ooww! Ghost!...Ma! Ma! Ghost Ma! Vinoth, just chill, I'm not a ghost. Ma! Ghost!...Ma! Now your BP is close to 220, if shoots a little bit more you might faint. So don't stress, cool down. Excuse me... You just show up like this and scare the hell out of me and you ask me to cool down? Who are you? How did you get in first of all? Cupid. Huh? In Tamil I think they call me 'Manmadhan. But in English they call me 'Cupid', Huh? I don't get it? Hmmm... You know there are millions of people who are in love right? So I'm the one who is responsible for giving them all these feelings like attraction, affection, love, etc., So in short, I am in-charge of love. What a load of rubbish, don't tell me stories. This is not even remotely believable. Fair enough. Sir Sir! I believe you sir! Hey Vino! Vino! What happened? What's all that noise? What happened? Nothing Ma, my sound system was in full volume, I just switched it on without realizing it. That's why it just blasted. Oh... But it sounded a bit different?- -No Ma... It's nothing. I just woke up from my sleep in complete shock you know? Okay Ma, you go and sleep now. Hmmm... You don't lock your door, okay? How many times should I tell you? OK Ma... I won't... go now. Go! Anyway, I'm getting late. Let's get to business. Hm? What business? Listen, I'll tell you what you do. Tomorrow at school, just fall flat on Rekha's feet and tell her that it was completely your mistake and just apologise to her. Initially she'll be a bit mad at you, she might not listen to you and may be even yell at you... It's quite natural. If you were in her position you would do the same thing. So, don't argue with her, just get through a bit of yelling and try to compromise with her. Okay? Excuse me, wait a second. What's up with all the instructions? You might be in-charge of everyone's love. But I'm in-charge of my love. I know how to take care of my life. So no thanks. Oh... So because of this little blip in your relationship, you've decided you don't need Rekha anymore in your life, is it? Yeah. You're making a big mistake Vinoth, you'll regret it in the future. I don't think I'll regret it. I have a lot more in life, I might meet a lot of girls... who knows, there is a chance I might even meet someone better for me than Rekha. I'm telling you again Vinoth. Just apologise to her. It's useless if you realise and regret this late in life. I don't think so... Sure? Sure. Hundred percent? Hundred percent. Hmm... Okay... Hello... Hey! I've called you some hundred times since morning. You've put your phone on silent mode and sleeping as usual? Hey no mate, It was super late last night by the time I finished work. I actually went to bed only around early morning. OK fine, you tell me the same story all the time... Just get ready quickly and come. We're already late. Hey, can you come over to my house instead, we'll go from here? I knew this was coming. Okay, I'll see you in half an hour. Be ready. Sure. Hello. - You went back to sleep right? Oh no, I'm getting ready. Bye. Okay bye. Oh you infinite lines... â€. Why do you rush?â€. When I see you..â€. Why do you vanish?â€. Oh you're up already? Your Mom asked me to tell you that she has reached Tirupathi safely. Okay. Okay, I'll have a word with him yeah okay. Who was that? Uh... Magic light productions. The Director doesn't like that voice it seems. He feels it would be great if you can sing it. Oh, that's why he's been trying to call me all night is it? Some five missed calls. They're going to shoot the day after tomorrow it seems, so they want the scratch a bit before that. Tell them no chance. And then, we have that TV interview this afternoon. I don't think I can do it today, please push it. What do you think? Yeah. Kick and bass sound much better now. Electric guitar can be a bit better. Oh What do you reckon? Just bring down the high mids and mids on the guitar. Make it a bit warmer. Okay. Hmmm Should be fine. Let's hear it. Is it okay? - Yeah. Much better, yeah. Oh yeah, the strings section will be here only by 2' o'clock, but they said we can go on till 9pm. Oh, I completely forgot to tell you. I have some other work today. I don't think I can make it for that session. But I checked the complete score. It's fine. Oh... okay. Moorthy Sir will be here right? - Yeah, he will be. Then he'll take care of it. Just make sure the mic'ing.. I'll take care of it. Excuse me... - Yeah, Yeah.. I'll be there in two minutes. Two minutes means just two minutes. Right? Just make sure the mic'ing positions are fine. Yeah sure. He hung up. Working all through the night and sleeping all through the day... Is there a logic behind why you have to make music only in the night? That's not the thing aunty. A.R.Rahman started this trend here of working during night. So everyone started following that trend. But now, he's shifted to daytime and all these guys are still stuck to working in the night... What are you doing now? I'm a plumbing contracter. I take care of laying plumbing lines for houses. Now I have some orders for some flats and apartment buildings too. But I'm still looking for more manpower for those projects. Here comes your friend. Hey, can't you get up on time just for this one day? I'm ready mate. So? Everything is settled? Don't ruin my mood now... Do you have any Rahman's songs? Just look in the second folder. Wow, this song just takes me back to those times... I think it will be brilliant tonight. Everyone will be there. The years just flew by... So everyone's coming? Yeah. Almost... except one or two. Oh... Who isn't? Hm, Vicky is not coming. She never responded for the invitation it seems. Soniya told me. Soniya... How many times did you propose to her? Tsk.. I was just jobless back then. Hey! Hi! Come in... Hi, How are you Sharon? I'm good. Work's been a bit hectic... Please sit, how are you both doing? Yeah fine. Where is Richard? Sir is busy... Richard. Chinese and Vinoth are here. Why didn't your wife come? Oh, she had to be some place else. Oh okay. Chinese is still the same crackpot, right? Hehe... absolute crackpot.. Where's the ball? Then Sir, are you seeing someone? Tsk... No. Hey, come on, tell me now. I swear I'm not. You must be meeting so many girls in your industry. Not even one interesting girl? That's the thing, I usually don't go out. But when I do, it's all industry people. Yeah. With them it's all purely work. True. I don't socialise with them. There are some really interesting girls in Sharon's friends circle. Those artistic types. I think you might fancy them, you should come to her party next time. Yeah? How are you doing? I'm doing fine... on one side it's business, and then on the other it's all about Sharon, Bryan and Anna... Every single day just flies before I realise it. But no complaints, I feel like my life has become complete only after marriage and kids. Okay you keep playing, I'll be back in a minute. Uncle... I lead 4-2... Hey! 'Boangu!' Daddy, what's 'boangu'? 'Boangu' means cheating Bryan. You get it? Yeah, cheating! Cheating! - I'm not cheating... Hey, how's Anand Anna? He's doing fine. I see him sometimes when I go that side to his shop... You won't believe how our area has transformed. There is a mall and a Starbucks and all that. Oh... Let's go for a round then. Yeah let's go. Richard. Naushad is here. "A song that stopped a longtime ago." "Has it started playing again by itself?" How's Durai? Tsk... poor guy, he's going through a terrible phase. He borrowed and spent a lot to get both his sisters married. So he's slogging now to repay all the debts. Come in. Are you coming or what? No mate, I'm not coming. It will be weird. Hey come on mate, it's going to be just us. It's not some random people. It will be fun. You'll have Richard around, and we have drinks. What else do you need? I don't even have any decent clothes ready to wear. We'll take care of that. Just come. Sounds that dispersed in various directionsâ€. Have become music in this airâ€. Words that went in different waysâ€. Seems to be blending in like poetryâ€. Hey Chinese! Hey Vinoth! How are you? - Hey! Idiot! What's up with this bike racer vibe? Just for a swag. Where are the other guys? They're already inside. Come on then, let's go. Okay, I'll park the bike and see you inside. Yo! Yo! Yo! This is the party! And guess who is in the house. It's DJ Vats!! Let's have a jolly good time and. Hey! It's Vats! Let's drop some beats... Hey! Vats! Hey, don't shout mate. Behave yourself. He looks smart right? Okay, I'm super hungry, I'll get something to eat. Let's go over there. Hey. That's number three now. What? Are you counting? Yeah, obviously. That's Richard and Sharon. - Oh.. Hi.. - Hi Anu! Hi Richard! - Hi. Meet my husband... K.Krishnamoorthy... Nice to meet you both. - Nice to meet you too. Vinoth is still not here? There. Vinoth.. Hi. Hi. Hey mate, Anu is here. I'll go say hi to her. Hmm.. Hi Anu... Hi Vinoth! Meet my husband... Hello.Hello..K.Krishnamoorthy... You can call me KK. I have listened to each one of your songs. By the way, I also follow you on Twitter. Oh yeah? Of course. Also, when I was in school I've learnt music too. Carnatic Classical vocals. In fact I've been meaning to tell you this. In your recent song, that movement from Aaberi scale to Naataikuruchi scale is sheer class... Oh thanks, but I don't have an in-depth knowledge of classical music scales. I just work with emotions and sounds, that's it. Oh come on, Classical music is nothing but a feeling right? What do you say Mr Richard? Is the work done? So you're too big to even come up and say hi? Hey, I'll call you back. Hey hi Anu, how are you? I'm fine, how are you? Where's your wife? Oh no, she has another family function that she had to attend. So she couldn't come. Oh, okay come on I'll introduce you to my husband. Yeah sure... I've just ordered for a drink, we'll get that and go? Yeah, Okay. Excuse.. Hello? Excuse me? Hey Naushad! Hey! Hi... Nisa, This is Thirumal. Thirumal...? Tsk... Fraudster... Oh..hehe... Hi... Hi, Your husband is a big-time doctor, what about you? I'm a housewife. Oh, that's nice... Actually I have a great business plan for housewives to earn money right from home. Just four hours of work and you make around ten thousand per month. Plus, there are added incentives. Hey, is that Catherine? Excuse me.. Hi Catherine. Hello. This is my wife Nisa. Hi, how are you? I'm fine, thanks. Hey Nisa, Is my make-up okay? Yeah it's fine. Why? Oh no, I somehow feel like I'm not on my best look today. You get what I'm saying right? Some days you feel that way right? I get that feeling almost everyday. Haha... that's true. So, when is it due then? What is? Oh, so you're not pregnant? Hey Catherine, this is too much. Haha... just kidding... But you already have a kid right? Yeah, we have a boy. I don't get why you go through this torture of getting married and having kids. I think marriage and kids are for losers who have nothing better to do in life. Am I right? Oh yeah, you're always right. Hi Catherine. Hey guys! You've already started your munching work. Please spare some food for others too. Want some? Hey, no way! I'm on a liquid diet. I can't eat all this crap. What's up Chinese? How are you? Yeah... fine Catherine. Oh my god Nisa, this guy was too funny in school. When we were in class eleven, he proposed to me around five times. Can you believe it? You can see how much of a mess he is now. So imagine how terrible he would've looked back then... horrible. Excuse me guys, just one scond huh? Hey Nirmala, What a funny dress you're wearing... Why aren't you on any reality music shows? Oh I find them extremely boring, I don't believe in competitions... Yo! Good evening everybody. This is DJ Vats and I'll be your MC for tonight, I take immense pleasure in welcoming you all to our first reunion party! We have planned for quite a lot of entertainment and fun activities. We are just waiting for some more people to land up. We'll start properly once they are all here. Oh! Look who is here.. - Hey.. Hi Anu. Hi Sid, how are you? Not bad. Meet my husband... K.Krishnamoorthy... We've already met once before. I think you don't remember. - Oh.. Sid, this is Chinese. Hi -Sorry... No problem. And that's Vinoth. Hello. - Hello. I'm sure you know him already? Oh no, I don't You are? Famous music director in Tamil film industry. Oh... I'm sorry. I don't listen to film music. Only rock and metal. That's my taste. Oh, do you at least watch movies? Yeah I do, but again, not Tamil movies. This whole thing of singing and dancing around and all that sentiment. I find them absolutely hideous. So Rekha, looks like you might have to give up watching Tamil movies anymore then. It's better for her if she does. Okay, you guys carry on. Rekha, I'll be at the bar if you need me. Just let me know. Sid, if you don't mind, can I join you for company? Yeah okay. But I don't drink alcohol you know. They do serve juice here right? Yeah, yeah. Where is your wife? She had a family function to attend. So she couldn't come. Oh... that's a shame. I thought finally I'll get to meet her today. Oh..I'll bring her some other time. Okay. How's your Mom Vinoth? She's fine... By the way, congratulations on your engagement. Oh..Thanks. Hey, have you met Naushad's wife? No. Oh she is so cute. Come I'll introduce you. Okay. Hi guys, hope everyone is having a great time. Almost everyone's here now. So let's get this party officially started. First and foremost we have an open bar and we also have shots and shooters coming around wherever you are. We also have karaoke, If someone feels like singing then please do come up to the stage and tell me, I'll get you the karaoke of your song. We also have a Tattoo artist, so you can get some tattoos for free. One more thing, we have an antique bioscope and we have loaded it with our old pictures, so take a look when you find time. We have some rare surprise pictures in it. Okay, so that's it for the announcements, and the bigger question is... Who is gonna start the party? Su! Su! Su! Hey, hey, hey, No no no.. No Su, We can do better guys. Hey, I'll kill you. - You're talking too much. Who is going to sing the first Karaoke? Come on. Gayathri.. Go and sing. - Oh yeah, go on. Okay... Let's give it up forGayathri.. Come on, come on girl.. Wow, What a voice! It's all about the texture. That's why you have to learn Classical music. Exactly the reason why I learnt it too, you know?...Sid? Oh okay. Yeah, that is Japanese word. Do you know what it means? No. Do you like to know the meaning? Yeah please. Karaoke means 'empty orchestra'. In simple words, it means 'no orchestra'...hahaha... Japanese are Japanese for a reason. What a smart name. They're always brilliant. - Yeah, very smart people. Hello... I'm Thirumal. You are Anu's husband, and you are Rekha's fiance... Am I right? Hi Thirumal. Hello.. - Hello. If you have five minutes, I can tell you about a brilliant business opportunity... Jeevan Raksha! Minimum investment, Maximum returns! Very good, very good. Excuse me. Why did he just leave abruptly like that? That's okay, let him go. You tell me. First, take a seat please. What is this business all about? Tell me. Rekha, this is absolutely boring, can we leave in five minutes? Hey! We just got here, how can we leave already? I just can't handle this anymore, it's too lame. That's why I told you right from the beginning that you might not get along with my friend so I'll go alone. You did not listen to me. Hmmm, so you want to stay here for sometime? Hey yeah Sid, please? I'm meeting all of them after a really long time. Once we leave the country in a few months, I won't get a chance to meet these guys properly for quite some time. Hmmm, then I'll get going. You let me know once you're done. I'll come and pick you up. Okay? Oh... okay... Hey are pissed off or something? No problem. Hey sorry Sid, just this one time... please. It's okay, I get it... bye. What? Excuse me. One whisky 'On the Rocks' please. Richard... enough. Hey I'm steady. Hey, I'm okay da. Control yourself mate. Gayathri, go on. Sing some more. Hehe, I'm done. Thank you so much. She sings so well, doesn't she? - Yeah, really nice. What material is this? It looks kind of cheap. I have no idea what it is.. Even after all these years her cocky attitude hasn't changed a bit. Oh.. Where did you get it from? Why don't you go for a designer wear, like the one I'm wearing. There's no need to mock us so badly in front of everyone. We need to give it back to her somehow. No no. Just leave it. I have a great idea. You just go and get an eye-liner sort of a thing from Sharon or Nisa. I'm sure you won't tell me why. I'll better go and get it. Uh... People near my neighbourhood go there, he's not that great. But he won't stitch it as badly as the one you're wearing, I'll give you his number if you want. Hey Naushad. Hey Francis! How are you? I'm fine mate. How are you? I am fine too. This is my boyfriend, Allen. Hi brother, Nice to meet you I listen to your radio shows every now and then. Is it? Thanks a lot.. Hey! Who the hell invited this guy? Ask him to leave first. Richard, what are you doing? Don't shout. Why did you call him? Calm down. - I told you all not to call him right? Don't create a scene now. - Richard! Ask him to get out! This is just indecent mate. He's the one who'e behaving indecent! I'm really sorry about him Francis. If he drinks a little too much, he becomes clueless about what he does. See... this is exactly why I said I didn't want to come to this party. I think it's better we leave. Hey please... please don't. Please don't go. Please stay. I'll talk to him. He'll be alright. Please sit, I'll get you both something to drink. Really sorry man. Please sit. That's not the way to treat someone. Richard, what are you doing? Get away from here now! Oh.. Now I have to leave is it? Do whatever you want! We are meeting everyone after a long time. Don't create a scene here. Why does it bother you so much? Hey what? All these are a part of marriage right? Come here. You know, I had a friend called Hari Krishnan. He just spoiled his life because of excessive drinking.. I hope you don't have those habits? Just music I hope? You don't need all those habits. Just get settled properly in life, Yeah? Good. Okay guys, so let's keep the positive vibes going, So, let me drop some positive beats. Don't you even think of something to your hair? It's already pretty damaged. Hey Catherine, your school photos are awesome. You look really nice back then. Of course, I was... Uh... where did you see? Over there, on that bioscope. Okay. Excuse me guys. Actually you have to look through that viewfinder. You think I don't know that. Where? I don't see any of my pictures. Actually the photos will be rolling. Just keep looking. There wasn't a single photo of mine. Idiot! What's so funny? Owww!...So beautiful. What's so funny? There's some dark ring on your face. Mate, did you see Kung fu Panda's angry face ...hehe. Okay people, so let's keep this party going hard. Can I see some more people on the dance floor now? I mean right now! You know why? Because this is a very special track! La dee da, La dee daâ€. Cause I'm posh in the way I lookâ€. Cause I'm posh in the way I walk and talk and find my way to hookâ€. La dee da, La dee daâ€. Cause I'm posh in the way I lookâ€. Cause I'm posh in the way I walk and talk and find my way to hookâ€. La dee da, La dee daâ€. Cause I'm posh in the way I lookâ€. Cause I'm posh in the way I walk and talk and find my way to hookâ€ I rule my life with jive and joyâ€. Cause I love to dance like a backstreet boyâ€. You can find that out by the way I dressâ€. Come dance with me, for God to blessâ€ I've got no mood for money and fameâ€. And all I wanna do is play the gameâ€ I've got no care for what they sayâ€. And I am, who I am and I love to beâ€. La dee da, La dee daâ€. Cause I'm posh in the way I lookâ€. Cause I'm posh in the way I walk and talk and find my way to hookâ€. La dee da, La dee daâ€. Cause I'm posh in the way I lookâ€. Cause I'm posh in the way I walk and talk and find my way to hookâ€. Posh it up, na na naâ€. That's all I say for nowâ€. Posh it up, na na na â€. That's all I say for nowâ€. Get down, get down, get down nowâ€. Everybody get down, get downâ€. Get down, get down, get down nowâ€. Don't care if you dance and drownâ€. Get down, get down, get down nowâ€. Everybody get down, get downâ€. Get down, get down, get down nowâ€. Don't care if you dance and drownâ€. That process is not over yet, so.. - Oh.. Hey mate, where's Nisa? Hey she's not well, so I just booked a cab and sent her home. Oh.. What happened? Nothing, nothing... ladies problem. Oh Okay. Ladies problem? What sort of problem? Please tell me. No no..Nothing. Come on.. It's okay even if men have problems, But ladies shouldn't. Tell me. What's the problem? What happened? We didn't even realise how all these years flew by right? Yeah, it feels like all these happened a while ago. Where is your fiance? Hehe... poor thing, he was extremely bugged. He left, he will pick me up after the party. Oh... So... You've fixed a date for your marriage? Yeah... February 12th. You should definitely come. Will you? Yeah yeah... sure. I'll come with Chinese. Hey! Do you remember this picture? Oh yeah! It was Anu's birthday. Chinese and Anu had a huge fight just before this picture was clicked. Hahaha... yeah. They were hardcore enemies around that time. Vinoth... Hey Joseph! Hi Rekha. - Hi... How are you mate? It's been a long time. I am good. You still play keyboard? I tried really hard, but never got a proper chance to play somewhere. So right now I'm playing as a second keyboard player in a cover band. You know, we play your songs almost in all our gigs. Hey, why are you being so formal? Please don't. Oh okay. Some of my bandmates don't even believe me when I tell them that I know you... Hey mate, can we have a picture together? Hey sure, come on. Rekha, can you click one? - Yeah, sure. Brilliant, I'm sure they'll be stoked to see this. Also mate, let me know if there are some opportunities for me to play keyboard. I'll surely let you know mate. Thanks... Where is Chinese? They must've gone out for something. Oh... okay... Bye Rekha. - Bye. So, Sir must have quite a lot of female followers... Must be getting a lot of online proposals... How many girlfriends do you have Vinoth? Hmm Awkward smile, then I'm right for sure. Guys, guys, guys, I have an announcement to make. Next I'm going to play a very special song. You know which pair we should get on stage for this one, so make sure you get them to the dance floor. Okay? ...So let's drop the beat! Hey Chinese! Come on! - Guys! Come on! Hey Anu! Go on! Get in! Do you remember the steps by any chance? What rubbish? I have no clue. Just freestyle it. Hey, are you okay da? Come on guys... Not again, I need some positive vibes to keep the party going, Hmm... Okay, Let me show you some positive vibes. Can I have one ice tea please? Hey, you know about Catherine right? Why don't you just stay away from her? She started it all by mocking me unnecessarily. But it was great fun to see Anu and you dancing together again after all these years. You both make a great pair. Thank you. But honestly, at that time I was more shocked to see. Vinoth and you break-up. I always thought you guys were made for each other. Even in my wildest dream I couldn't imagine you both splitting up. Please don't think I'm yapping because I'm high or something... I have known Vinoth since kindergarten. And I still know him inside out... Over the years I know how many girls he has spent time with. But he never quite managed to get the comfort and attachment he got from you with any of t. He has no clue if he will ever find that again with someone. I know it's quite inappropriate to talk to you about this now, but I just felt like telling you this. Please don't mistake me. - Hey, come on, you think I'll mistake you? As a friend, you are just like Anu for me. OK guys! This is a swell party. We've been trying to get a very special V.I.P to the stage for quite sometime now. But he is making a huge fuss. I think you all need to give him a push. So guys, please make an effort and make him sing. Come on! Come on... I've been waiting to hear you perform live, please come. - Come on Vinoth! We're all waiting for this Vinoth. Just sing one song mate. Come on. Oh no... not here please. What do you mean not here? You go all around the world singing for everyone, Go on, just one song. Come on guys cheer him up. Which song mate? I have Karaoke for all your songs. Uh... Is there a guitar around? - Yeah man, I'll get you one. When he picks up the guitar it's usually a ruckus! Oh stop it, don't ruin it. Yeah mate, don't spoil his mood now. Give us something in the scale of 'Sahana' please.. Actually, I've performed in huge concerts for massive crowds all over, but this makes me more nervous than all of those. This is a very special song for me. Because this is the first song that I wrote and sang. Wow, that's nice. Wow, that's nice. You are the beginning... You are the endâ€. You are all three manifestations of timeâ€. You are the ocean... You are also the shoreâ€. You are even the windâ€ I was hurt at the side of my heartâ€. There's not a day I don't think of youâ€ I am hardly myself anymore... â€. I see your beaming images all aroundâ€. But the ones without a shoulder to lie onâ€. There's just no one like you... â€. You are an infinite riverâ€. The one that I drown in without being able to swimâ€. You are the moon in the skyâ€. But I'm the one that wanesâ€. I got lost in one half of a forestâ€. And I eroded without being able to find my darling's footprintsâ€ I carry unfathomable burden in my chestâ€ I am just a non-being without you by my sideâ€. Days go by... â€. But I am just a body without a soulâ€. You are the beginning... You are the endâ€. You are all three manifestations of timeâ€. You are the ocean... You are also the shoreâ€. You are even the windâ€. Did you get lost in some far-off land my dear?â€. When I searched and finally found you, my eyes shone like firefliesâ€. If only time could go backwards, I would plead your forgivenessâ€. The moment you look me in the eyeâ€ I'd undo all my mistakes... â€. You are the beginning... You are the endâ€. You are all three manifestations of timeâ€. You are the ocean... You are also the shoreâ€. You are even the windâ€. Like a watch that stopped tickingâ€ I was at an absolute standstillâ€. Where did you go my dear?â€ I wore a beautiful mask for those around me to seeâ€. With a fake smile that was quite enough my dear... â€ I made this song for you to hearâ€. Tuned to your favourite scaleâ€ I gathered all your lightning gold smilesâ€ I then strung it together and wove it all around... â€. You are the beginning... â€. You are the end... â€. Oh it was beautiful! One more Vinoth! Please? Come on Vinoth, one more please! Hey one more mate! Hey... that's enough... please... Thank you. Come on Vinoth. Just one. No, no..I'm done. Thanks. Mama Mia! Hey yo Catherine! DJ Vats. I know. It's written on your t-shirt. Burn! That's the attitude I like in a bird... hehe. So, DJ Vats wants to take you out on a dinner date, What are you doing on Saturday night? I am going to commit suicide. Oh, how about Friday night then? Don't you dare touch me if I didn't ask you to. Okay? Hey.. Please please.. Chill. DJ Vats, peace out girl. That was really good. It was good right? - Oh yeah. Mate, he's been trying to sell a policy the entire evening but nothing seems to be working out for him. Hey Fraudster! Come here... Come here now! What's up Richard? Your tone has changed. Super high is it? Don't worry about that. But tell me something. Where are all the things that you nicked from me during school. Hehe... you're funny. What's so funny? My WWF trump card, my badminton racket, Michael Jackson cassette... Hey Durai... do you remember that super mario videogames? Oh yeah! He nicked that too. Give all that back now! You're asking me all that now? How can I give it back? You can't right? - No mate... You can't give it back right? - I can't mate.. So, instead of that, you're going to have four tequila shots now. Bartender! Line-up tequila shots please. Hey I don't drink mate. I seriously don't. It's so hard to control him when he gets high. He's done some terrible things in college. Hey I don't drink da. That's fine da I'm in the middle of some work mate. - What work? Insurance... Hehe... Let's get high and do it. Come on mate, tell him to stop... Hey... Think of it like a syrup and just gulp it down! That's enough mate. Are you high now? - No. You're not? Then have some more. Tell me now. Accept that you nicked all my stuff. No, I didn't. Hey.. Enough of spinning now. You've been scamming people with these right? Come here with me now. Drinking too much is his only vice, otherwise he is a really sweet father and a great husband. Hummm... Nice. Mr.Thirumal. Huh?...Is it done? All done! Brilliant. Hey what have you done? It says 'Fraudster'? Huh? Seriously? These guys are mental... Anyway, I will wash it away when I take a shower tomorrow, it's all good. Sorry sir, you can't wash this away. It's a permanent tattoo. Oh... then should I put some kerosene to make it go? It still won't. You have to go through laser treatment to remove it. What laser treatment? How can you put a tattoo like this? You idiot! Excuse me! Mind your language! - Do you know who I am? Are you sure you don't want to eat? - No, it's fine, bye. Mate, Catherine is leaving. Hey, where's your bike? - It's parked behind. What are we going to do now mate? I have an idea. Go on, I'll tell you. Everything I do, I do it for you.. It's adorable. This is so sweet. Super Richard. It was brilliant Richard! Thank you, Thank you guys. Once more Richard. Go for it. Hey! Why are you still here? Oh God. You're bloody shameless. I asked you to get out of the party right? Stop it Richard! Hey, leave me... Listen to me Richard! Just calm down now. Hey... come on mate.. I knew Vats was up to something. No mate. Just for some positive vibes... Okay guys, let's keep the party going. One more large please... I'll have two of the same... Hey Sharon, who are you getting it for? For me. For you? You don't drink. Yeah, I don't drink. That's why I feel ashamed of all that you do when you're drunk. If I get drunk and get high like you, then I can join you in being shameless and also enjoy that with you. Hey! Are you mad? You can't handle it. Sharon! Richard, leave my hand. Sharon! You are just overreacting! Oh you call this over-reacting? Then what do you call the ruckus you created with Francis a while ago? You won't get that Sharon. Don't get into that. I can't accept him that way. Why Richard? You're generally an open-minded person... Why can't you accept this? I can't think of reasons, but the day he became like this, I decided he doesn't exist in my life anymore. That's it! Simple! We have two little kids Richard. We still don't know what their sexual orientation might be. There is a remote chance that one of them might be like Francis. What will you do if that happens? You'll throw them out of your life too? This is nature Richard, people don't choose to become this way. You know that very well. You are not an uneducated idiot. The Richard I know, is a loving husband, caring father and a great friend. This, is not you... God, Sharon! Please stop it. What do you want me to do now? Okay then, shall we give it our final touch? Mate, I think it's enough. Let's leave. Mate, she just slapped me in front of everyone at the party. We've got some payback to do for that. You said that right? This is enough mate. Let's just leave now. No way, Let's do this. Give me that. No, listen to me. Oh damn! Oh my God! Who is that...? Hey Su... Is that you? I can see your pants clearly, better come out! Actually, I came alone. There's no one else with me. Hey Chinese... out now. I thought you guys might've changed after all these years. But no. The same absolute idiots! No Catherine, Chinese said we'll just do it for fun. Just shut up! Mummy. Yeah baby, what happened? Hehe... Why is this girl calling you mummy... Come in. I was madly in love with a professor in college. An already married professor. He loved me very much too. Quite a decent man. As soon as he got to know that I was pregnant he proposed to marry me and divorce his wife I said okay to that. Then, one fine day, his wife turned up at my house with her kid. She just fell on my feet crying and begging me not to ruin their family... I promised her that I won't see her husband ever again. And I never saw him again. Everyone around me adviced me to go for an abortion, but I didn't have the heart to do that. Sorry Catherine, we acted like idiots without knowing all these. That's okay. At the reunion I thought I'll be like the same old Catherine that you know from school tim. So naturally, you reacted just like the way you used to do back then. Anyway, this is the original Catherine. This is my life now... and it's a complete mess. I have to get something out of my head too. I lied to everyone at the reunion. My wife didn't have to attend another function. Actually, we're getting divorced. Once we sign our papers in a couple of days, it's all over. Why divorce? She had been in an affair with her team leader from office for over a year. I was the last one to know. The security guy told me. After that we tried to work it out, but it became complicated. We didn't have any other option than to separate. Guys, my life is quite a wreck too. I'm already old now, but I don't have a proper job and I don't think I'll ever get marrie. I do some small jobs in my friend's workshop now and then to survive. Even that bike is not mine. I just rented it for a day from a mechanic shop I know. Was that funny? Oh no. That car outside is rented too. So I don't know what to do now. Hey, sorry Catherine. We'll clean all the mess right away. Okay, I'll bring the hose that side. Let's do it together. Yeah, okay. Yeah, but before that... Is there anything to eat? I'm starving. Oh I'm hungry too... I did not eat properly at the reunion. Uh... Are you okay with some sandwiches? Sure. - Oh yeah. Hey, If you don't mind shall I make it? You look tired. Sure, you'll find everything in the kitchen. Yeah... Francis! Can I talk to you for a couple of minutes? Now what? Francis, should I wait over there...? It's okay brother, you can be here. Tell me. I shouldn't have behaved like that at the party... Listen mate, I'm not homophobic or anything. But it's just an unexplainable mental block. Maybe because we knew each other since school and I saw you differently back then, I just couldn't accept this transformation in you. But now I know and I need to work on this. And I will. I'm really, really, sorry mate. Not just for today, but also for everything I did at school too. It's okay. At first even I couldn't accept myself. It took me a lot of time to accept myself, But now, I am trying to give a voice to the whole LGBTQ+ community on radio. My parents are still not able to accept me. But I'm glad at least you all accept me the way I am now. That means a lot to me. Sorry brother, I also owe you an apology. It's okay. We've gotten used to these things. You both should come home for dinner when you find time. I'm not saying this just for a formality, I'm serious... I want you to meet my kids. Sure, I'll come sometime soon. I'm not saying this just for a formality too. Let's leave? Okay then, we'll get going. We'll catch up soon. Bye Francis... Meeting again after all this timeâ€. Looks have changed but the hearts haven'tâ€. The old moustache seems to be springing up againâ€ I feel the same old fragrance on me againâ€. Sounds that dispersed in various directionsâ€. Have become music in this airâ€. Words that went in different waysâ€. Seems to be blending in like poetryâ€. Your song was brilliant Vinoth. I loved your guitar playing. Thanks. I remember hearing this song for the first time on the radio. I figured out what it was all about right away. You've eaten? Yeah, I did. But I don't mind giving you some company. Yeah..please... Thanks. So what does Siddarth do? He is actually an MBA from IIM-Ahmedabad. Right now he works for Standard Chartered. But he has an exciting offer from ANZ bank New Zealand. So we have to pack up right after our marriage. Oh. New Zealand is a great place to settle down. I've been there for concerts. Really beautiful place, very nice people... Hmm... so what are the films you're working on now? I'm working on five films right now... Three of them are quite rubbish, one is just about okay. But one of them is super interesting... It's a story set in the 90s. Oh nice... Do you have any of the songs you've made for that film? Yeah, you want to hear it? Yeah.. Okay, I have the song on my phone, but my earphones are in my car. I'll go get it. Oh, I'll come along then. I have to leave after that anyway. Okay. Okay guys, So coming up is the last track for the night, DJ Vats, peace out. It's just a basic version... Yet to be mixed. As if I can tell the difference... I just want to hear the song, that's all. Is it playing? I can't hear anything... You can't? - No. Let me try. Oh sorry... I played you the wrong format. Here, you will hear it now... I'm fine, you can use that one... Actually the effect might be a little weak when you hear with a single earphone. I'm quite happy with this effect. What do you think? - Really nice... Who is singing? Arjun Madhusoodhan. - Oh. I think it will be brilliant in your voice. Hey, you have any A.R.Rahman songs on your phone? Oh yeah, loads. I still listen only to those. Hey, play me something then please. It's been a long time. Uh... okay, which song? You don't know which song I'd want to hear? Hello. - Hey Rekha.. Hey Sid, tell me. - Are you done? Uh... Yeah. I think I'm done. Where are you? I'm at the gate having a smoke. Then just wait for me there. I'll walk down. Okay, bye. Okay Vinoth, I think I should leave. I missed you. All this time... I missed you. Bye Vinoth. Hey, you park the bike and get in. I'll see you in a bit. Okay mate. Rekha is it? Just saw her walking by... And crying. I think the biggest mistake of my life was breaking up with Rekha. Come one mate... At that point, in the heat of that moment you just did that. What can we do now? That's how life is. Everything doesn't go the way we want them to. In my life, I've accomplished everything I wanted to do with my music. I am actually living my dream. But now, all this music, all the money and fame and awards doesn't make any sense for me anymore. Nothing makes sense mate. My life without Rekha will always be incomplete and empty. I'm a lonely loser mate. Just a lonely loser. Hey, Not like that. I've lost the most important thing of my life... What will I do now? What do you say now Vinoth? You said you will never regret this ever? But look at you there, weeping like a schoolboy. Okay, you know how to take care of your life. I'll get going then. Sir... Please don't leave. I've made a mistake. A huge mistake. I'll apologise to Rekha right away. How will you do that now? I told you, and you didn't listen to me. Now it's too late. Sir sir... Please don't tell me you can't. I know you can. Please Sir. Rekha sir.. But why are you worried? You still have a lot more in life. You might even meet someone better than Rekha. I don't need anyone else. I want my Rekha. Please Sir. I want to be only with her. Have you given it a proper thought? Yes sir. Sure? Sure sir. Please Sir. Hundred percent? Sir... Please don't torture me like this. After a few years they had their first re-union. But, it was a little different.

They have a cute two year old girl. Her name is Akshara. Hey, Come and speak. Vinoth will talk next. I am really glad to meet all of you again. I think the last time we saw each other was at Naushad's marriage. Ever since I was a kid, my only dream and ambition was to become a great music composer. But somehow I couldn't manage to do that. But till this day, I've never regretted that fact even for a split second. Because Rekha is with me. She's much more important for me than anything else. She makes my life complete. We've seen this person somewhere right? Yeah? I don't think so. Actually I've met all these people at different junctures, like I did with Vinoth. But I don't think they remember it. This is their story... What's yours?
