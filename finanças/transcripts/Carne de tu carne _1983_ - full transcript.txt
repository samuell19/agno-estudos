Enrique... ...my dear brother. Flesh... ...of my flesh. Blood... ...of my blood. Dad, dad! She's dead! Dad! Grandma's dead! May everlasting light shine on her. May she rest in peace. May everlasting light shine on her. May she rest in peace. May everlasting light shine on her... FLESH OF MY FLESH. We brought the barbed wire. We came to string fences, not to dig for treasures. What did you find there? Look, boss. It's a good soil, isn't it? - Very good. - It has everything. Let's start stringing, go to the fence. Bring the wire. Listen, men. Get the wire up. 'Midnight virgin.' 'Virgin, that's you.' 'A virgin for all to adore...' I never liked peacocks. Half of the time they're blue... ...the other half, they're red. I've never trusted them. Fucking peacock! AUGUST 6th, 1956. ...broken promises... Look, Dr. Meneses. This won't get us anywhere. I want to have that will... ...no later than tonight. Tonight? Well, you know how to solve those things. Leave that alone! Don't play with it. Good morning, Dr. Meneses. How are you? Look what I brought you. Pretty, isn't it? From Caicedonia. They sent some jam for you. Pretty, isn't it? What atrocities you bring home! I had no idea. Go tell Asuncion to bring some coffee. Andres Alfonso. Sir? Get dressed to go pick up your mom and sister. Tellez. They must bring a lot of things, coming from the U.S. Go help them. Precious Margareth! How are you? Margareth, dear... How pretty you are! You're so tall. - Anna. - How are you? Dear! That's great! It was terrible, when they told me the news. I was scared 'cause she had fallen. - Of course... - Who fell? But fortunately, just a few bruises. You go in the front. Anna, you go in the front. Eber, open the door. When can you go to Neiva? We have to go, it must be beautiful there. - They're so big. - Go ahead, Julia. Yes, they've grown so much. - Eber, take us straight home. - Yes, madame. Yes, let's go. How's everything at home? The same. But things will change, now that Maria Josefa has died. After all, she was the heart... ...of that house. Mama suffered so much. She was in great pain. It was very difficult. I even asked God to take her. She had lost all her teeth... ...her veins were purple and all dried up. Please, don't talk about that. How was the trip? I wish I had been with her in those final days. I went to the woods, burned a stick... ...and here's the smoke. This song is a hit there. "I, Maria Josefa Borrero de Velazco... ...in the city of Cali... ...on the 27th day of June... ...of the year 1956... ...being in full posession of all my faculties... ...declare before witnesses... ...this to be my final will. In compliance with the law... ...and acting in freedom of choice... ...I leave my daughter: Julia Velazco de Madrian... ...the buildings on 5th and 15th streets. To my daughter, Anna... ...who destroyed her legitimate marriage... ...but nevertheless gave me her affection... ...and two dear grandchildren who kept close to me... ...in spite of the distance between us in recent years... ...and to Luis Garcia... ...her legitimate first husband... ...with the hope that property commonly owned... ...will help them to find happiness together... ...I leave the summer farm called "La Emma". The films are about to start... Asuncion, turn on the light. - Call the kids. - Yes, sir. Hey! Why are you fighting? All passengers aboard. They need you now. I'll take the house. Give me that... -lt's mine. - No, mine. My Mom gave it to me. To Andres Alfonso and Margareth... ...my equally beloved grandchildren... ...for whom my affection is the same, in spite of... ...of their different origin... ...and who have brightened the last years of my life... ...I leave the control in equal shares... ...of my sugar mill stock... ...as listed in an inventory... ...guarded by my lawyer... ...Dr. Jacinto Meneses. He will administer the profits for them... ...until they reach an older age. As for Asuncion... ...who is like one of the family... ...I leave her a pension of 600 pesos a month... ...for a peaceful old age. She will take this money from the charity fund. To Enrique, my brother... He's the one who lives in San Antonio. ...disowned by our parents a long time ago... ...because of his reprehensible habits... ...which disgraced the reputation of the family... ...and ostracized by his relatives ever since... ...I leave the house and land where he now lives... ...known as San Antonio... ...to do with... ...as he pleases. Go on. Go on, that's it. Now, put your fingers here. Like that! Let me see. Thank you, very much. - Uncle, uncle. - Quiet, quiet. Quiet, now comes the film. Andres, bring the projector. I wish the best for you and your family. What'll we see? The one with Margareth on the swing. No, first "La Emma." No, "Laurel and Hardy." No, let's see Maria Josefa. What for? She's dead. Turn out the light. Turn out the light. -Get out of the way. - I won't. Let me see. AY, what memories! Look, look! Well, there's uncle. Rafael Francisco Vallecilla. A great doctor! An eminence! One hand blessed for surgery and the other for charity. He had 115 spurs. What? Mama looked great. Who would have thought it? Asuncion, Turn on the light. What was it? What happened? A bulb turned out. Don't worry. Here's another. - Go help papa. - Be careful, there. Go help him. Ready! Lights out! Hey, move! Who's that with the long hair? A writer. - A relative? - Second cousin. And where is he? In Europe. - No, he killed himself. - What, Andres Alfonso? LLook at the kids in their Scottish outfits. Asuncion's aunt made them. Look at the betrothed, real lovebirds. Who's that? That's grandma. -Don't talk about the dead. - Why not? Dr. Vallecilla eating cake. My God, it's Emilia! Sainted woman! This is when we snapped the photo. I still have it. Mama looks great. That's just foolishness, but mama looks great. Ls that "La Emma"? Don't you remember? Look, she fell. Emilia fell, and she hurt her ankle. She wouldn't let anybody rub or even touch it. How horrible! He's a drunk! There's the black sheep. He ate up almost all the grass. There he goes again. Uncle Enrique's great but he's a communist. A communist? Look at that, Andres in skirts! Who would have thought that? Faggot, faggot! I never thought I'd see him in skirts, how I'll tease him. Uncle! Andres's bothering me. Andres Alfonso! Stop playing the fool in front of your sister. Andres Alfonso. Sorry about that. All fathers are like that, mine too. Want some gum? - Sure. - Here. Remember? Remember? How we used to fight! What do you think of mama forgiving Enrique? And leaving you, her daughter... ...two houses that are totally falling apart. And to you, useless floodlands. They're no good. - That's all. - What? No more films, time to go to bed. Hello. What are you reading? "That's what they did in fact." "At daybreak... ...they went back to the prairie." "After greeting the nymphs and Pan... ...they sat under the oak tree." "They played the flute... ...they kissed... ...they hugged..." How is James doing? Working like a slave. Always travelling. He'll be away for eight months, building a sugar mill. This is for Andr,s. I'm worried about him. He's good for nothing. I'd like to take him back to learn English in the U.S. It smells just the same. I do feel homesick there. Earthquake! Earthquake! It's an earthquake! Earthquake! Mom! Mom, mom! Uncle, uncle! Uncle! We still don't know what caused the explosion. Seems it was the boilers in the freight yard at Lara. All we know is that the city is on fire... ... and panic reigns on the streets. The explosion affected several neighborhoods. All we have left to do is pray. Our father who are in heaven... ... hollowed be thy name... We interrupt this prayer to give a last minute report... ... it seems the dynamite was placed in some military trucks. But we have no confirmation from the military forces yet. Colombians, attention! The following is a special news report... Andres Alfonso. Margareth. Breakfast is ready. The causes of the explosion are still unknown... This coffee is cold. Asuncion, pack the waffle iron. What for? There's no electricity there. The graves in Cali were open. There are dead bodies everywhere. It's a macabre spectacle of pain and horror. Asuncion. Bring me the covers for the bird cages. Yes, madame. This butter is rancid. Thousands of people were injured... ... and the number of ambulances is not enough... Andres! - Andres Alfonso. -I'm coming. - Does the car have gas? - Yes, sir. - And the van? - The van too. Go to La Emma. Tell Floremiro we're in Canas Gordas. Bring the generator... ...and all the fruit and vegetables you can. - I want to go too. - No, not now. I haven't been there in so long. Asuncion, you obey only my orders, alright? Don't start wandering around. Watch out. Let them go. Okay, go on. Come back before dark. You don't know how to drive. - It's going backwards. - We'll see. - Good morning, Floremiro. - Good morning, Andres. Good morning, Margareth. When did you come back? Yesterday. What happened last night? Some trucks blew off. 20.000 people were killed. Don't exaggerate. Floremiro... Father wants you to send the generator... ...and some vegetables. If you need anything, they're in Canas Gordas. I'll get that. Also get two horses ready. - We'll ride over to Enrique's. - Right away. Why are they that way? They degenerate... ...because of the crossbreeding. - Let's go to the swing. - Fine. Mother said one summer... ...they had to cut down the swings. Why? Because the pole fell down and killed a child. Do you remember? The harlequin of the mountains! No. Watch out! It's a nettle and it pricks. Then, where? Then you swell up like a balloon. It happened to me once. When you see nettles you're supposed to say... "I see you nettles." "I see you nettles." "I see you nettles." And you don't get pricked. Help! What have I got? Turn around, turn around! Wait a second. Is it a spider, an animal? What is it? Help me. - What happened? - Look. Suck, and it'll stop bleeding. Isn't it bitter? All blood tastes alike. Let's tell uncle Enrique about the will. Okay, let's go! Careful! Remember, Madremonte is around here. That's a mother who killed her children... ...because she was going crazy. She took them into the mountains and ate them. That's why they called her that. Uncle Enrique! He must be around here. Uncle Enrique! - Hello, uncle. - Hello there, how are you? - What's up? - Not much. I hadn't seen you since four or five years ago... The last time I saw you, I was eleven. You're so big now. You're a real young lady... ...and you look like your mom. What's happening in Cali? I just heard what happened... Some military trucks loaded with dynamite exploded. That's what soldiers are for. You're soaked. Come in and change clothes. It was awful! The roof caved in, the lights went out. We had just arrived. There are dead bodies everywhere. I don't want to go back. And look at this. Don't worry, it's not a big deal. How about a drink? Good idea. Okay. - And where's your father? - In Canas Gordas. - Is the house badly damaged? - Yes, uncle. This one's for both of you. You know what? Maria Josefa left you San Antonio. Go change your clothes. Go ahead, go get changed. There's clothing in the closet. Flesh of my flesh. Blood of my blood. Maria Josefa. My dear sister. - Where? - Over there. You know what? I think uncle Enrique and Maria Josefa were lovers. So what? Button me up, please. Let's show Enrique. That dress was my sister's! All this land... ...belonged to her. You didn't know her... ...before she went crazy. She was the only one who hid me here... ...when they were trying to kill me. Who? It was dangerous then, to say certain things. Especially when they were family matters. Uncle, explain. Well, your father... ...had bought some land in Caicedonia. On a spur of the valley. And one day, he was measuring it... ...when, PUM! Gunfire from the mountain. And they accused me. They said I had organized a conspiracy... ...against my beloved nephew... ...the conservative. But, why you? I was the black sheep of the family. I was the free thinker. The one who seized land for the peasants... ...who came to Cali... ...to make new neighborhoods. I'll tell you something... ...your dad, Margareth... ...is a very smart engineer. While he was building the sugar mill... ...he represented... ...an important dairy product company... ...from Switzerland or the Netherlands. Since he had a lot of cows, business was good. He made all the sugar mills and factories around here. And your father's a philanderer. He was always surrounded by "birds" too. "Birds"? They were the hired henchmen who smoked in peasant homes... ...and robbed their land with the help of Meneses. I don't exist for anyone. Yet everyone has passed by here... ...refuges... ...criminals... ...lovers. I'm the black sheep of the family! That's why I'll die... ...as I should... ...alone. And I will be buried alone. Those earrings were my sister's too. She left them to me. What's in that chest? There lies the whole family's truth. That's all I will inherit you. Look what I found, Margareth. "Even though time has gone by... ...you've been a memory in my flesh." "Not only have you been my brother but..." I'm worried about the kids. I didn't want them to go. He always wanted electricity... ...but I don't know... Let the house keep its old charm... ...with candles. Will the government ignore this explosion... ...like everything else? It seems it was an accident. How could it be? How could they leave trucks of dynamite on the streets? That can only happen here. Still, I feel calm there. Not that. Have they sent the bamboo sticks yet? They should send them today. Hopefully, they'll let them on the highway. That roof needs support. Manuel Maria, take care of that colt. Are the others in the house? Wait here. Hi, kinsfolk. What's new? - Open these cans, Asuncion. - Yes, sir. Damn! This tragedy on the day of your arrival. You can't live in Cali anymore. There's fear of the plague. It seems two drunk soldiers shot the truck by accident. Nobody knows for sure. That's pure conjecture. Mariela, give me a glass of water. Of course. It's nice having a soldier in the family. Yes, but not in power. Eber, could you open this can for me? Mother. On the 13th of June... ... the virgin Mary... ... dethroned Laureanito... ... and a cop came instead. Cheese! Sure. Throw a rock and hide your hand, huh? And this is supposed to be for the injured, right? Delicious! - Let's taste. - It's as good as it is there. It's not bad. What would "the stormy man" in Spain say about all this? Who's "the stormy man"? Dr. Laureano Gomez. Remember the last time we were in Benidorm... ...to see Dr. Laureano Gomez? The motherland! Such good cheese they have! Monchego and goat cheese... ...with good bread and cider... ...are better than Roquefort or Camembert. Better than this. Why can't life here be like it is in Spain? Progress, order... ...and good wine. How traditional, Julia! You know what? We Velazcos are noble. We come from one of the Meninas. Those were dwarfs who entertained the kings. Eber! Anyhow, they were nobles and lived in El Escorial. Sir? Eber, your hat. I'm sorry. You're such a noble person, Eber. Take the bamboo sticks to Cali. Then, find Margareth and Andres... ...and tell them to come home immediately. They must be in La Emma. Alright! Goodbye, Eber. Before God was God... ...and the Penascos, Penascos... The Quiroz were Quiroz... ...and the Velazcos, Velazcos. Before God was God... ...and the Penascos, Penascos... The Quiroz were Quiroz... ...and the Velazcos, Velazcos. Before God was God... - It's nighttime. - So what? - What happened? - Nothing. Uncle! Enrique! What happened? Uncle! Uncle! You who have tasted the richness... ... of the blood several times... Floremiro, I hear footsteps. The bandits! Be careful. You who have tasted the richness of the blood... Margareth! Margareth! Citizens. Cali has been struck by a terrible disaster. I'm sure that behind this catastrophe... ... are the hands of international communism. The military forces... ... will not rest... ... until they find the real culprits of this tragedy. Peace... ... justice... ... and liberty. Dear... The baby... The baby's gone. - But I saw him. - He's gone. I left him in the crib. He's not there now. Don't worry, we'll find him. - Thank you, Virgin. - Thank God, we found him. Thank God! Don Enrique! Don Enrique! Don Enrique! Margareth. My wife is giving birth now. Nobody's in the farm. The food and the generator are in the van. Floremiro! Floremiro! Andres! Margareth! Lady Santa Anna... ... why is the child crying? For an apple... ... he has lost. I don't want one... I don't want two... ... I only want my apple... ... the one that I lost. Don Enrique! Don Enrique! Margareth! Margareth! Margareth! Mar... Push down hard and hold it. Come on! Breathe deeply. Push, push dear. Good! Now, hold it. Hold it! Have a drink, friend. This morning... ... my wife got up to make coffee. She asked me to get some firewood. When I came back in, she screamed... ..."Where's the baby?" I had left him in the crib... ...but she said it wasn't there. I said it couldn't be. We checked, but he was gone. I looked all over the house. At six in the morning... ...I found him playing in the bathroom. You know, it's the hosts. Are you still into that? You know what, friend? The chickens were restless all night... ...and four of them died. And the neighbors' dogs died in the night. That's ghosts... ... and witchcraft. Dogs and chickens die every day in my hometown. The crops were uprooted... -Walls smeared with blood. - Friend, I say it's ghosts. Those aren't ghosts, they're bandits. That's why we're here. Here it comes. Push down hard... ...and hold it. Here it comes. Don't worry, my friend. My wife knows what she's doing. - What is it? - It's a girl. She's beautiful. And she's whole and healthy. Maria Emma. Lt's a girl. Congratulations. The sooner you start walking, the better. Indians give birth alone and standing. It's a good omen. Good luck, my friend. Be careful. So long, so long. At your service, here. Dear. That plant is drying up. Something bad's gonna happen. Forget those superstitions. Who is it? I wanna see the baby. Open up. This is my house. Floremiro. Margareth. Margareth. - Who's there? -Justice and law. Ortega. - Gonzalez? - Yes, colonel. Search the rooms. - Are you a treasure digger? - Yes, sir. Have you found anything strange? When did you last see Florentino Muoz? We haven't seen him since he came to have his kid. Colonel, we just found some dead chickens. Keep searching. - Gonzalez. - Yes, sir. Take them to the school. Let's go, hurry up. Move, move! You, come here. - Do you know where they are? - No, sir. But you saw them. I told you they were here but they haven't come back. We'll talk later. He's the only suspect. Let's take him for a walk. If that's so, go ahead. No. No. How are things? We haven't found out who's responsible for this. We have a suspect. We'll make him pay for this. Put them all in jail if you have to... ...but find out who did this. Let them go, Benjamin. Poor people. Go home now. Go on, quickly. Quickly. Do you see what I see? Are you convinced now? It doesn't look like an indian tomb. At this very moment... ... we are witnessing in anguish... L... the mass burial of those who died in Cali... ... in the explosion on August 7th. Ln this overwhelming ceremony... ... everyone has gathered... ... to close a tragic chapter in the history of Cali. With our collective efforts... ... and international solidarity... ... we are also opening new possibilities... ... for a future of peace, justice... ... and liberty. THE END.
