WHAT'S THAT SMELL COMING FROM UNDER YOUR DOOR, PAL? - AROMATHERAPY! - AROMA-WHAT? CANDLES... ROMANCE... MOANING. - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - SPARE A DOLLAR? YOU GOT CHANGE FOR A HUNDRED? NOBODY LIKES A WISEASS. HEY? HEY, ROCKEFELLER? WHAT ARE YOU GIVING YOUR MONEY AWAY FOR? YOU'RE A MONTH AND HALF BEHIND ON THE RENT! - SATURDAY! - SATURDAY? I'LL BE RINGING YOUR BELL BRIGHT AND EARLY. MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE MONEY. HEY, YOU WANT ME TO GET YOU A COUPLE CANDLES? YEAH, GET ME A COUPLE CANDLES. IT'S VERY RELAXING. YEAH, WELL RELAX THIS! NO, NO, I DON'T NEED ANY MONEY. I'VE GOTTA BIG DATE TONIGHT, I GOTTA GO. YEAH. MAKE SURE YOU GIVE MOM A BIG KISS FOR ME, OKAY? ALL RIGHT, BYE. LOOK AT THIS. THERE YOU GO. ( meows ) LOLITA, I REMEMBER WHEN THE "ELECTRIC COMPANY" WAS A FUNNY KIDS' SHOW. ( coughs ) LOLITA! LOLITA! ( fire roars - crackles ) YOU GOT INSURANCE? NO. ME NEITHER. SPARE A DOLLAR? AROMATHERAPY? THAT'S WHAT YOU CALL IT? YOU COULDN'T JUST DO PSYCHOTHERAPY LIKE THE REST OF MY TENANTS? LOOK AT THIS. YOU'RE A SCHMUCK, KID. ( meowing ) LOLITA! YOU GOT OUT OKAY! JACK! PARKER! GEE, I DON'T KNOW IF NOW IS THE BEST TIME. JACK, MY APARTMENT BUILDING NEARLY BURNED DOWN. I'M SORRY. I'M KIND OF IN A SITUATION HERE. JACK. ALL RIGHT, COME ON IN. woman: JACK? IF IT COMES UP, MY FIANCE DIED IN A TERRIBLE TRAIN CRASH SIX MONTHS AGO. THE TENTH FATALITY THIS YEAR? ( crashing ) THANK YOU FOR CALLING PSYCHIC PALS HOT LINE. I SEE YOU TAKING A LONG VOYAGE. AUDREY, I'M GONNA SHUFFLE THE TAROT DECK HERE... LET'S SEE WHAT THE CARDS TELL US, SHALL WE? RIGHT NOW YOU'RE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME IN LIFE... AND... AUDREY, THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME KIND OF PROBLEM, I'M GONNA PUT YOU ON HOLD. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. DO YOU REMEMBER THE "THREE S'S"? SLOW, SUSTAIN... - STATIC. - STATIC. OH, HEY-- YOU FORGOT SWINDLE. ( chuckles ) YOU KNOW THE LONGER YOU KEEP THEM ON THE PHONE, THE LONGER YOU KEEP YOUR JOB. DOES THAT MAKE SENSE? THE TROUBLE SEEMS TO BE GOING AWAY. YOU'RE IN NEW YORK CITY, MAN. THERE'S AN AMAZING DESSERT TRAY OF BEAUTIFUL WOMEN... A LITTLE CREME BRULEE. EASY FOR YOU TO SAY, YOU WORK AT A TALENT AGENCY, SURROUNDED BY BEAUTIFUL ACTRESSES. DID I TELL YOU TO WORK AT 1-900-CUCKOO? IT WAS THE ONLY JOB I COULD GET AFTER THE MAGAZINE FOLDED. PARKER, YOU ALWAYS DO THAT. YOU WERE FIRED. THE MAGAZINE FOLDED LATER. IF THAT CONGRESSMAN HAD GIVEN ME A QUOTE BEFORE HE WENT TO JAIL, I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD TO MAKE ONE UP. YOU OUGHT TO WRITE FICTION. YOU'RE GOOD AT THAT. HEY. JUST KEEP BREATHING, ALL RIGHT? THE WOMAN OF YOUR DREAMS COULD BE AROUND THE CORNER. THAT'S THE POWDER ROOM... YES, BUT IT'S ALSO THE BOYS' ROOM. BOYS USE POWDER. SOME, YES. THIS IS MATT... AND TROY. THEY'VE BEEN HERE THE LONGEST, WHICH ISN'T SAYING MUCH, SINCE THE EMPLOYEES HERE HAVE THE SHELF LIFE OF SUSHI. THAT YOUNG MAN LOOKS VERY FOCUSED. I BET HE'S AN EXCELLENT PSYCHIC. WELL, IF ANY OF US WERE REAL, WE'D BE AT THE BELMONT'S PICKING TRIFECTAS, NOT MAKING EIGHT BUCKS AN HOUR. YOU MEAN NOBODY HERE IS REALLY A PSYCHIC? - ARE YOU? - OF COURSE I AM! - THIS IS KIM... - HI, KIM. WE'RE GOING TO SPEND THE REST OF OUR LIVES TOGETHER. - DOES SHE KNOW THAT? - NOT A CLUE. - AND THAT'S MY CUBICLE? - YES, YOU'RE THE LAST ONE. Woman: I have the coolest one bedroom on the Upper West Side... - with a view of the river. - HOW MUCH? - It's just $2,000 - A YEAR? ( hangs up - dial tone ) Hardwood floors, high ceilings, with oodles and oodles of charm. HOW MUCH? Ah, $1,750. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING WITH LESS "OODLES?" This is a great place in the East Village. It's just three blocks from Thompkins Square Park. - HOW MUCH? - For you? Just $1,500. - YOU GOT ANYTHING CHEAPER? - Yeah, in Cleveland. (woman screaming with pleasure) HEY, PARK. AREN'T YOU ON THE EARLY SHIFT TOMORROW? YEAH. YOU OUGHT TO GET SOME SHUT-EYE. I ALMOST FORGOT. NEED ICE. JACK, NOTE FOR THE NEXT TIME-- THE ICE GOES IN FIRST BEFORE YOU DRINK YOUR DRINK. MAYBE IN YOUR BOOK. I LUCKED INTO MY LAST APARTMENT. BEING FROM IOWA CITY, I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHAT "RENT CONTROL" MEANT. YOU SHOULD GET A GOOD CHURCH GIRL OR A GOOD COLLEGE GIRL, SHACK UP AND SPLIT THE DUES. YOU DON'T WANT THAT ONE, THAT GIRL THINKS SHE'S PSYCHIC. SHARE ADS... PEOPLE ALWAYS NEED ROOMMATES. YEAH, BUT THEY'RE ALL DEVIL WORSHIPERS AND FREAKAZOIDS. YEAH, BUT IT'S HALF THE DAMAGE, MAN. IT'S WORTH LOOKING INTO. PARKER, I SEE A WHOLE NEW WORLD OPENING UP FOR YOU, AND A WONDERFUL RELATIONSHIP. ( chuckles ) YOU'RE A LUCKY MAN. SHE'S CRAZY. YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? THERE'S SOMETHING REAL SEXY ABOUT HER IN THE RIGHT LIGHT. YEAH, MAN, THIS IS A REALLY COOL PAD. BEER? SURE. RUNNING WATER... PRIVACY... WINDOW... WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR LAST ROOMMATE? IF YOU DON'T MIND MY ASKING. MOVED TO THE BIG HOUSE. OH, A HIGH RISE? SING-SING. MAJOR DRUG DEALER. GUY WAS TENSE. IT'S JUST BEEN SO HARD TO FIND A ROOMMATE THAT, WELL, MELDS WITH MY LIFESTYLE. PEOPLE HAVE SUCH PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS ABOUT WOMANHOOD AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THEM. AND YOU DON'T MIND ROOMING WITH A MAN? NO. I DON'T MIND, IF YOU DON'T. "2B OR NOT 2B." I'M HERE ABOUT THE APARTMENT? YOU MUST BE PARKER. WE'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU. YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE WHAT SOME OF THE FLAKES THAT ANSWERED MY AD SAID THEY DID FOR A LIVING... "PIERCING CONSULTANT," "TAROT CARD READER," ( laughs ) HARDLY SPELLS "RELIABLE" TO ME. SO WHAT DO YOU DO? UH, I'M IN... SALES. TELEPHONE SALES. IT'S JUST TEMPORARY, UNTIL I GET ANOTHER WRITING GIG. I USED TO WORK FOR "THE NEW YORK MINUTE," UNTIL IT FOLDED. - COFFEE? - SURE. SO WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR OTHER ROOMMATE? GORDON AND I LIVED TOGETHER FOR TWO YEARS. HE JUST DECIDED IT WAS TIME TO MOVE ON. WE'RE STILL FRIENDS, THOUGH. WHAT ABOUT YOU? ME AND JACK HAVE BEEN LIVING TOGETHER FOR TWO WEEKS, BUT HE'S DRIVING ME CRAZY. ALL HE THINKS ABOUT IS SEX. I TOLD HIM THERE'S MORE TO RELATIONSHIPS... BUT HE WON'T LISTEN TO ME. SO IT'S OVER BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU? NAH, JACK AND I WILL ALWAYS BE CLOSE, WE JUST SHOULDN'T LIVE TOGETHER. WELL, PARKER, THE PLACE IS YOURS IF YOU WANT IT. SIX-FIFTY A MONTH PLUS UTILITIES. ALL RIGHT! I HAVE A CAT. THE BUILDING ALLOWS PETS, RIGHT? THE BUILDING DOES, BUT I DON'T. I MEAN, I CAN'T. I'M, LIKE, REALLY ALLERGIC. OH, GOD, I KNEW THIS WAS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. ME, TOO. SORRY. YA' KNOW, I'VE GOT A FRIEND WHO'S LOOKING FOR A ROOMMATE, COOL LOFT ON FIRST. YOU SHOULD CHECK IT OUT. - I DEFINITELY WILL. - I'LL PASS ON YOUR NUMBER. HEY, KITTY. WHAT'S THAT, HUH? WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THERE? PARK, SAM CALLED ABOUT THE APARTMENT. MEET TOMORROW AT FOUR. FIRST AVENUE. FIRST AVENUE! SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD. I READ ABOUT THIS WOMAN IN ARMENIA WHO ATE YOGURT EVERY SINGLE DAY OF HER LIFE FOR 104 YEARS. REALLY? WHAT HAPPENED THEN? I GUESS SHE DIED. ( cash register beeping ) Cashier: THAT'LL BE FOUR DOLLARS. WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO WITH THAT? UH, PUMPKIN PIE. MY FAVORITE. DO YOU, AH, LIVE AROUND HERE? ARE YOU COMING ON TO ME? NO, I'M NOT COMING ON TO YOU. I JUST CAME TO BUY A PUMPKIN! BECAUSE IF YOU ARE, I'D PREFER YOU JUST CAME OUT AND SAID IT. BELIEVE ME, I'M NOT COMING ON TO YOU. I BELIEVE YOU. THAT'S $17.95. Female voice: Hello? HI, IT'S PARKER CONCORDE, ABOUT THE APARTMENT? - Come on up. - OKAY. ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME? YES! I MEAN, NO! IS SAM HERE? JUST A MINUTE. HI, I'M SAM. YOU MUST BE PARKER. SMASHING PUMPKIN. THIS IS BARNEY. SAY HELLO, BARNEY. HI, BARNEY. PARKER, WHY DON'T YOU AND YOUR PIE FILLING COME INSIDE? WOW, THIS IS REALLY NICE. THANKS, I'M IN LOVE WITH IT. ACTUALLY, IT'S MY COUSIN'S. I'M JUST SUBLETTING WHILE SHE'S IN PARIS STUDYING AT THE SORBONNE. SO, ARE YOU A PAINTER? YEAH. BUT I WORK AT THE HAYDEN PLANETARIUM. REALLY. WHAT'S THAT LIKE? IT'S REALLY COOL, I GET TO RUN SOME OF THE SHOWS, TEACH THE KIDS, AND BEING SUCH AN ASTRONOMY BUFF I REALLY CAN'T BEAT IT. IS THIS ONE OF YOUR PAINTINGS? YEAH. OH, DO YOU SELL THESE? NO, BUT I'D LIKE TO ONE DAY, YOU KNOW, HAVE A SHOWING AT SOME SOHO GALLERY, SUPPORT MYSELF WITH MY ART. NOBLE, HUH? YEAH. WOW, THAT'S A DINOSAUR. LOOK AT THAT. IT'S MY MOM'S OLD STEREO. HER ALBUMS, TOO. "WEST SIDE STORY," THAT'S MY FAVORITE! REALLY? MINE TOO! ( barks ) OH, DON'T MIND HIM. HE'LL WARM UP ONCE HE GETS USED TO YOU. I HOPE HE HAS A CHANCE. NOW, I KNOW IT'S SMALL, BUT IT GETS A LOT OF LIGHT. AND THE BED'S PRACTICALLY BRAND NEW. DAVID LEFT IT WHEN HE AND CURT MOVED TO SAN FRANCISCO. SEE? PRETTY FIRM. OH, BY THE WAY, I'M SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT YOU AND YOUR FRIEND, JACK. TOM GAVE ME ALL THE INFO ON YOU-- WRITER, PHONE SALES, CAT, CUTE. SO, YOU DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM ROOMING WITH GUYS? NO, I MEAN, BEFORE DAVID IT WAS DEAN, AND BEFORE DEAN IT WAS PHILIP, AND BEFORE PHILIP-- WELL, ANYWAY, YOU GET THE POINT. I FEEL SAFER LIVING WITH A MAN. PLUS, I MADE SOME GREAT FRIENDS. SO, YOU'RE NOT WORRIED ABOUT THINGS TURNING ROMANTIC? ROMANTIC? I MEAN, YOU'RE VERY-- YOU'RE A VERY ATTRACTIVE WOMAN. OH, THANK YOU, PARKER. THAT'S WHY I ONLY LIVE WITH MEN WHO ARE GAY. YOU KNOW, SAM, I'D REALLY LIKE TO LIVE HERE. I'D LOVE TO LIVE HERE. BUT, I'M NOT-- OH GOD, YOU HAVE BEAUTIFUL HANDS! THESE ARE ARTIST'S HANDS, LARGE AND STRONG, YET GRACEFUL AND WELL-FORMED. YOU HAVE A REALLY GOOD LIFELINE, TOO. I'M SORRY, WHAT WAS IT YOU WERE GOING TO TELL ME? ( sighs ) I'M NOT... READY TO MOVE IN IMMEDIATELY. OH, THAT'S TOO BAD. WHEN CAN YOU MOVE IN? TOMORROW? GOOD. IT HAPPENED SO FAST. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY. THREE LITTLE WORDS, "I'M NOT GAY." HOW EASY IS THAT? YEAH, BUT SHE'D ONLY ROOM WITH GAY GUYS. IT MAKES SENSE, IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT. WHICH OBVIOUSLY YOU DIDN'T. SO SHE THINKS I'M GAY. I GET TO LIVE IN A HUGE LOFT WITH A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN FOR AN ASTOUNDING, BY NEW YORK STANDARDS, $550 A MONTH. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN WHEN YOU WANT TO DO THE FILTHY NASTY WITH HER AND ALL SHE WANTS FROM YOU IS AN OPINION ON WHICH EARRINGS TO WEAR WITH A DRESS? BESIDES, WHAT DO YOU KNOW ABOUT BEING GAY? WHAT DO I KNOW ABOUT BEING A PSYCHIC? I'LL FAKE IT. WORD GETS OUT FAST. WOW. I WISH I COULD TRAVEL THAT LIGHT. IF YOU HAVE A FIRE, GIVES LIGHT A WHOLE NEW MEANING. I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT. ( laughs ) FLAMES WERE EVERYWHERE. I RAN OUT ONTO THE FIRE ESCAPE, AND FOUND LOLITA ON THE STREET, THANK GOD. DID THEY EVER FIND OUT WHAT STARTED IT? YEAH, SOME GUY WAS PRACTICING AROMATHERAPY AND FELL ASLEEP. WHAT A MORON. WORST PART IS I LOST MY COMPUTER. MY PARENTS GAVE IT TO ME FOR MY TRIP TO NEW YORK, SORT OF LIKE, FOR GOOD LUCK. - OH, EVERYTHING ON IT? - EVERYTHING-- MY NOTES, STORIES, OUTLINES. YOU KNOW, I THINK IT WAS LIKE A SIGN FROM UP ABOVE. "PARKER, DON'T QUIT YOUR DAY JOB!" WHAT'S THIS? ANOTHER SIGN. YOU KNOW, I NEVER ASKED YOU, WHAT DO YOU SELL, EXACTLY? UH... FUTURES. OH. MY FRIEND FRANK IS IN COMMODITIES AT GOLDMAN SACHS. YOU GUYS HAVE TO MEET... HE IS VERY CUTE. SO NOW THAT YOU'RE SINGLE AGAIN, DO YOU HAVE YOUR EYE ON ANY CUTE GUYS? NO, NOT A ONE. YOU? YEAH, HIS NAME'S BEN. HE'S... WONDERFUL! WE'VE BEEN DATING FOR ABOUT A MONTH. HE'S VERY SWEET AND FUNNY AND HE'S VERY HANDSOME. - WHAT'S YOUR TYPE? - MY TYPE? YEAH, YOU KNOW, TYPE OF GUY. WHAT GETS YOU HOT? OH, I DON'T...I DON'T REALLY HAVE A TYPE. I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN. THERE ARE SO MANY GREAT-LOOKING GUYS OUT THERE, WHY LIMIT YOURSELF? YEAH, RIGHT. HEY, CONGRATS ON THE LOFT. IT SOUNDS EXCELLENT. SHARING AN APARTMENT WAS INSPIRED-- I OWE YOU A BEER. ANYTIME. ( toilet flushes ) WHOOOOO--DAMN!! WHAT THE HELL DID I EAT?! WHAT'S UP, PARK-MAN? SO, WHO'S THE NEW ROOMMATE, CHARLES MANSON OR JEFFREY DAHMER? - JEFFREY DAHMER'S DEAD. - OF COURSE HE'S DEAD! HE DIED OF INDIGESTION... DIDN'T YOU HEAR? HE ATE ALL HIS ROOMMATES! ( laughs ) I'M JUST MESSIN' WITH YOU, MAN. CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR NEW CRIB, DOG. HAND ME THIS, BRO! ♪ YOU CAN'T SAY NO... PARKER! JUST THE MAN I WANT! I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINKING. YOU'RE THINKING, I LOOK FAT. SO, THAT'S WHY I'M GIVING UP THE BEN & JERRY'S AND THE FRENCH FRIES. IN TWO WEEKS YOU'RE GONNA BE SAYING, "I WISH I HAD THAT ASS." I COULD SAY THAT NOW. OKAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS ONE? I THINK YOU LOOK INCREDIBLE... BUT I THOUGHT YOU'VE LOOKED INCREDIBLE FOR THE LAST 14 OUTFITS. YOU'RE SWEET. I JUST NEVER KNOW WHAT TO WEAR WITH BEN, YOU KNOW. I MEAN, HE'S KIND OF CONSERVATIVE, BUT HE'S GOT THIS, LIKE, WILD SIDE, TOO. WELL, HE'S LUCKY TO HAVE YOU, NO MATTER WHAT YOU WEAR. THANK YOU, PARKER. OKAY, WHAT DO YOU THINK, THE HOOPS... OR THE DANGLY ONES? - THE HOOPS. - YEAH, GOOD CHOICE. ♪ I USED TO BE SOMEONE I'M NOT ♪ ♪ I'D STARE OUT THE WINDOW AND LIVE IN MY MIND ♪ ♪ THE SAFER I FELT, THE MORE THAT I DIED, ♪ ♪ LONELY WITH YOU ♪ AS MY LIFE PASSED ME BY ♪ NOW I WILL DO EVERYTHING, I WILL DO EVERYTHING ♪ ♪ I WILL SAY EVERYTHING, I WILL SAY EVERYTHING ♪ SO MANY WOMEN, SO LITTLE TIME.

ALL RIGHT, YOU'VE GOT ONE OF THREE WAYS YOU CAN GO BEFORE YOU START BOUNCING OFF THE WALLS. ONE, YOU CAN TELL HER THE TRUTH AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS. SAM'S A COMPLETE HONESTY FREAK. IF SHE FINDS OUT I LIED MY WAY TO GET IN, I'M ON MY WAY OUT. ALL RIGHT... TWO, YOU CAN SETTLE DOWN WITH A NICE FELLOW, HANG OUT, SEE WHAT HAPPENS... SAVE SOME MONEY, MOVE TO L.A. WHAT'S BEHIND CURTAIN NUMBER THREE? YOU CAN GET LAID, AND I MEAN RIGHT AWAY! THE SOONER THE BETTER! ONCE YOU'VE DONE THAT, IT'LL BE A LOT EASIER TO DEAL WITH MISS "DO YOU MIND IF I WALK AROUND IN MY UNDERWEAR?" I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. ( loud music and conversation in background ) HI.

SO, ARE YOU NERVOUS? A LITTLE. ARE THOSE FAKE? UH... VERY NICE, UM... PICTURES. IN OUR COUNTRY, WE CALL THEM "PAINTINGS." - "PANTIES?" - NO, PAIN-TINGS. - PAN-TIES. - PAIN-TINGS. - PAIN ...

IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU, BORIS. IT'S AN ENORMOUS, LARGE VERY GOOD PLEASURE FOR ME AND I'M LOOKING VERY FORWARD TO THE NEXT TIME I EAT YOU. THAT IS WHAT WE CALL IN MY COUNTRY, "FROM RUSSIA, WITH LOVE." FUCKING FOREIGNERS! WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE KISSING ME! LADIES FIRST, MY GAY CABALLERO. - OH, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN! - PARKER, SHE IS AMAZING! I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU KEEP YOUR HANDS OFF HER! I MADE MY BED AND NOW I'M LYING IN IT. DID YOU EVER THINK OF MAKING HER BED AND LYING IN THAT? SHE'S GOT A BOYFRIEND. SO, PARKER, EVERYONE IS AVAILABLE! AND I MEAN, EVERYONE! C'MON, I'LL BUY YOU A PIZZA. THEN, WE CAN GO SOMEWHERE AND MAKE OUT. THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE MOST ROMANTIC PLACE IN ALL OF MANHATTAN. OUT OF ALL THE BOYS IN THE CITY... - YOU PICKED ME. - ISN'T THAT SPECIAL? HEY! CHECK THAT OUT, PARK. YOU LIKE CARROT CAKE? OH, NEVER MIND, TAKE A NUMBER. THAT'S BEN! - BEN WHO? - SAM'S BEN! I KNEW THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT THAT GUY I DIDN'T LIKE! LET'S NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS. MAYBE IT'S HIS SISTER. MAYBE IT'S HIS STEP-SISTER... FROM ARKANSAS. THIS IS GOING TO BREAK SAM'S HEART. YOU COULD TELL HER. - HI. - HI. SO, ARE YOU IN LOVE? LET'S JUST SAY, I FEEL LIKE I'VE KNOWN BORIS FOR YEARS. PARKER, THAT'S WONDERFUL! HE'S SEXY... IN A UNITED NATIONS KIND OF WAY. YOU COULD SAY THAT. I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY YOU CAN'T GO OUT WITH BORIS AND TOM. GIVE THEM BOTH A CHANCE. I GUESS YOU COULD SAY I'M JUST... I'M KIND OF... OLD-FASHIONED. BESIDES, HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF, SAY... BEN WAS SEEING YOU... AND SOMEONE ELSE AT THE SAME TIME? OH, PARKER, I THINK WE'RE A LITTLE BEYOND THAT STAGE. - SAM? - YEAH? DON'T TAKE THIS PERSONALLY, BUT, UH... YOU EVER FINISHED ONE OF THOSE? PICASSO SAID, "A PAINTING IS NEVER FINISHED." NO... BUT I WILL. WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU PAINTING? IT'S AN ABSTRACT OF LOLITA AND BARNEY. WHAT DO YOU THINK? IT'S A LITTLE TOO ABSTRACT. GOOD! 'CAUSE THAT MEANS I CAN JUST PAINT RIGHT OVER IT. THAT'S THE GREAT THING ABOUT PAINTING, IF YOU DON'T LIKE SOMETHING, JUST PAINT OVER IT AND START FRESH. COME HERE, I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. TA-DA! I THOUGHT YOU COULD USE SOME INSPIRATION... THE ARTICLE STILL HAD THE DATE ON TOP, SO I CALLED YOUR HOMETOWN PAPER AND REQUESTED ANOTHER COPY. HERE'S THE REST OF THE PAPER. THERE WAS SOME REALLY COOL STUFF THAT WAS GOING ON HERE--- CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE KEPT YOU FROM PURSUING YOUR DREAM, BUT NOW YOU'RE GOING TO GET BACK ON TRACK! WHY CAN'T MEN JUST BE HONEST? YEAH, IF THEY'RE INTERESTED, WHY DON'T THEY JUST COME ON OUT AND SAY, "HEY, I'M INTERESTED"? EXACTLY-- AND NOT CONCOCT SOME BIG LIE... - JUST TO GET OUR PHONE NUMBER. - YEAH, AND NEVER CALL. LOSERS. IT'S NO NEWSFLASH, BUT REJECTION SUCKS. YEAH, BUT IF YOU LIE, YOU'RE GONNA GET CAUGHT SOMETIME, SO WHAT'S THE POINT? MEN ARE JUST GIANT ARTICHOKES. THEY'RE PRICKLY AND HAIRY AND HARD UNTIL YOU GET TO THE HEART... WHICH IS THE BEST PART. ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE GAY? Sam: HE IS SWEET, ISN'T HE? YOU EVER HAD YOUR ASS WAXED? DID I MENTION, SAM'S FRIEND KATE SORT OF HIT ON ME THE OTHER DAY? OH, THAT MAKES SENSE... "TURN GAY, ATTRACT WOMEN." YOU KNOW, IT'S WEIRD. EVER SINCE I'VE BEEN "GAY," I'VE FELT MORE COMFORTABLE AROUND WOMEN THAN EVER. OF COURSE, YOU'VE GOT NOTHING AT STAKE. YOU'RE JUST WAITING FOR SAM AND HER BOYFRIEND TO BREAK UP. 'TIL THEN, NO OTHER WOMAN IN THE WORLD EXISTS FOR YOU. THAT IS SO NOT TRUE! OH, YEAH? WHAT'D YOU THINK OF HER? - WHO? - I REST MY CASE. WOULD YOU LIGHT SOME CANDLES FOR AMBIENCE? - SURE. - BEN'S ON HIS WAY OVER. ( knock at door ) THAT'S BEN. WOULD YOU GET THAT, AND TELL HIM I'LL BE OUT IN A MINUTE? ONLY IF I CAN UNLEASH THE ANIMALS. I CAN'T HEAR YOU. YOU HAVE TO SPEAK UP! I'LL LET HIM IN! WHEN I LET HIM IN, YOU BITE HIM! RIP HIS HEAD OFF! ( whispering ) READY, WHEN I LET HIM IN, YOU BITE HIM. COME ON! ( dog barking ) COME ON, YEAH COME ON! GET HIM! GO! HEY, PARK. WHERE YOU GOING? WHERE'S MY GIRL? SHE'S PUTTING THE FINISHING TOUCHES ON HER MAKE-UP. WOMEN... BUT I GUESS YOU DON'T HAVE THAT HASSLE, HUH?. SO, DO ALL THE WOMEN THAT YOU DATE TAKE A LONG TIME WITH THEIR MAKE-UP? - WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? - I SAW YOU WITH THAT GIRL. - OH, YOU MEAN... - DON'T EVEN! YOU DIDN'T TELL SAM, DID YOU? NO, THAT'S YOUR JOB. THIS IS GOING TO HURT HER. NO, YOU ALREADY HURT HER, SHE JUST DOESN'T KNOW IT YET. I KNOW, BUT I'VE GOT THIS THING FOR BLONDES, YOU KNOW. SHE WAS A REDHEAD. WAIT A MINUTE... "MR. INNOCENT." YOU DON'T THINK I SEE THE WAY YOU LOOK AT HER? YOU MAY HAVE HER FOOLED BY THIS LITTLE CHARADE OF YOURS... BUT I KNOW! KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE... BISEXUAL. WHAT!? DON'T YOU EVEN THINK ABOUT TURNING THIS AROUND WHEN YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW--- WHAT ARE YOU TWO GETTING SO INTENSE ABOUT? - FOOTBALL. - BASEBALL. - BASEBALL. - FOOTBALL... SPORTS. PARKER, I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE INTO SPORTS. OH SURE, I MEAN, ALL THOSE GUYS TOGETHER WITH THEIR TIGHT, MUSCULAR, COLORFUL UNIFORMS? WE SHOULD GO. WHY? I THOUGHT WE'D HANG OUT HERE FOR AWHILE. YEAH, BUT I'M REALLY HUNGRY... YEAH, BEN'S GOT QUITE THE... "APPETITE." IT SEEMS I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE. PARKER, DO YOU WANT TO JOIN US? OH NO, I... UH... I ATE.

THE SHIT ALSO SAYS HE HAS TO GO AWAY FOR A YEAR! WHY? FOR BUSINESS. YOU KNOW WHAT'S WORSE? HE'S GOING TO PARIS! AND HE'S NOT TAKING ME! HE DIDN'T EVEN ASK ME TO GO. HE SAID HE LOVED ME BUT NOT IN AN EXCLUSIVE WAY. WHAT THE HELL KIND OF LOVE IS THAT? IT'S A SELFISH KIND OF LOVE. PARKER, WHY DO MEN HAVE TO LIE? OH, I DON'T KNOW... I THINK SOMETIMES 'CAUSE... THE TRUTH HURTS. THE TRUTH ONLY HURTS WHEN IT FOLLOWS A LIE. ♪ DRY YOUR EYES, I'M HERE NOW ♪ WE'LL GET THROUGH THIS SOMEHOW ♪ PARKER, ARE YOU SLEEPING? NO. - CAN I ASK YOU A FAVOR? - YEAH, ANYTHING. CAN I SLEEP WITH YOU? I DON'T MEAN LIKE THAT. I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE. OKAY. THANKS, YOU'RE THE BEST. ARE YOU OKAY? I'M OKAY. IT JUST HURTS A LITTLE BIT. I GUESS YOU'RE NOT USED TO SLEEPING WITH GIRLS, HUH? - MY SISTER. - YOUR SISTER? YEAH, MY PARENTS, THEY USED TO ARGUE ALL THE TIME. SO I'D RUN DOWN THE HALL AND JUMP IN BED WITH HER. SHE'D TELL ME TO LOOK OUT THE WINDOW AND COUNT ALL THE STARS AND THEN EVERYTHING WOULD BE OKAY. WAS IT... OKAY? I'D FALL ASLEEP BEFORE I COUNTED ALL THE STARS. - GOOD NIGHT, PARKER. - GOOD NIGHT, SAM. ♪ I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT I'LL MAKE IT THROUGH ♪ ♪ THAT'S WHY I COME TO YOU PARKER, DO YOU THINK PRAYERS ARE ANSWERED? YEAH, I DO. LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT. YOU SLEPT TOGETHER, ALL NIGHT, IN THE SAME BED, SIDE BY SIDE, BUT NOTHING HAPPENED, RIGHT? NOTHING PHYSICAL, JUST SPIRITUAL. I GOTTA TELL YOU, YOU'RE SCARING ME. - WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? - WHAT WERE YOU SUPPOSED TO DO? IF I GOTTA TELL YOU... YOU MIGHT AS WELL BE GAY. A BEAUTIFUL, WONDERFUL WOMAN ACTUALLY TRUSTS ME. THAT'S A GOOD THING. YEAH, IF YOU'RE A PRIEST. LOOK AT THAT. OH MY GOD... WHOO, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT? PARKER, ARE YOU HOME? - HI! - HI. YOU'RE READING THAT OLD MAGAZINE AGAIN?

I'VE GOT TO TAKE THIS LEASH OFF! YOU KNOW, PARKER, YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WALK ME HOME. I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO STAY WITH BORIS. OH, I THINK BORIS HAD HIS EYES ON SOMEONE ELSE. I HATE TO SAY THIS, PARKER, BUT I THINK BORIS IS A HUGE FLAKE. YOU COULD DO A LOT BETTER. ( Billy Paul's "Me and Mrs. Jones" plays ) I KNOW. SPEAKING OF HUGE FLAKES, HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN SO WRONG ABOUT BEN? SOMETIMES WITH THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE ATTRACTED TO, WE ONLY SEE THE GOOD THINGS. I KNOW, JUST WHY DO I ALWAYS FALL FOR THE "HALF-PEOPLE"? YOU KNOW, THE GUY WHO'S MARRIED TO HIS WORK; THE GUY WHO'S COMMITTED TO SOMEONE ELSE; THE GUY WHO JUST NEEDS TO BE COMMITTED. BLAME IT ON YOUR PARENTS, EVERYBODY ELSE DOES. WHAT WERE YOUR PARENTS LIKE, WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP? GROWING UP... I WAS DEFINITELY DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL. ALTHOUGH HE DIDN'T KNOW IT. HE WASN'T AROUND MUCH. WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM? WHERE WAS HE? WHEN I WAS 14, HE TOOK OFF WITH ANOTHER WOMAN, YOU KNOW, LEFT ME AND MY MOM FEELING PRETTY UNWANTED. I COULD IMAGINE... THAT'S GOTTA HURT. YEAH. I JUST REALIZED IF I DIDN'T INVEST TOO MUCH EMOTION IN ANY ONE THING, I COULDN'T GET TOO BADLY HURT IF IT DIDN'T WORK OUT. I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THE DIVORCE DIDN'T MAKE ME A GREAT FINISHER. WELL, YOU'RE GREAT AT EVERYTHING ELSE. - C'MON! - WHAT? YOU LEAD. I THINK IT'S LIKE THIS. ( record skipping ) WHAT IS IT WITH YOU AND THESE WORN-OUT RECORDS? WHAT'S WRONG WITH CDs?

CONTACT. - WHAT ARE WE DOING? - I DON'T KNOW. - YOU KNOW, WE SHOULDN'T. - I KNOW. PARKER, ARE YOU REALLY ATTRACTED TO ME? OR IS THIS JUST TO GET BACK AT BORIS? BORIS IS THE FARTHEST THING FROM MY MIND. IS THIS TO GET BACK AT BEN? WHO'S BEN? SEE SOMETHING UNUSUAL? WHAT, A WOMAN IN MY BED? THIS IS MY BED. OH, RIGHT. I HAD A FANTASTIC TIME LAST NIGHT. ME, TOO. IT WAS JUST FULL OF SURPRISES. DRESS UP LIKE A MAN AND YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN. - HOW DRUNK WERE WE? - NOT THAT DRUNK. IS THIS WHAT THEY CALL A ONE-NIGHT STAND? THAT ONLY APPLIES TO STRANGERS. I'M GUESSING YOU FELT STRANGER THAN I DID. ACTUALLY, IT FELT PERFECTLY NATURAL. I HOPE THIS WASN'T A MISTAKE. THERE'S ONLY ONE SURE WAY TO FIND OUT. ( giggles ) WAIT!
