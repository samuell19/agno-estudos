It's me... Nothing... Just called to tell you you're a real asshole. You have to pay up the rent and the money. Or I'll come back and shit on your life. Could you find this one? She's let her dog loose in the playground. My kid was about to hug the thing. I tell her take your dog for a walk outside the complex. She tells me it's dangerous outside! You should be the bigger person... Well I didn't say anything to her. That dog is the old lady's whole life. By the way, congratulations, Mrs. Khorshidi! Thank you. I'll be bringing you an invitation card. - Where are you holding the ceremony? - We'll have it in the complex. The neighbors said why pay for a place when we can have it here, like the Mohsenis' wedding. What's the card for then? We'll just show up. Congratulations, Mrs. Khorshidi! Thank you very much. What happened to Reza, by the way? Old man: Reza had become a pro already. Woman: Parviz, you'll come with Father, of course? Old man: We helped him start a dry-cleaning. Parviz: We'll be honored. Bravo! I hope he makes it. I hope everybody makes it. He was a really good kid though. His work was excellent, too. Everybody was happy with him. - Goodbye. - All the best. Thank you. So it'll be ready by Wednesday, right? Absolutely. Here you are. Much obliged. The meat is undercooked. Why? It seems fine. The meat should cook slowly in the tomato juice. You just fried it again. Add a little salt. Salt won't help. The meat is raw. Do you want me to fix a can of tuna for you? Next time let it cook slowly in the tomato juice. Father! Hi. Hi. You are Father's guest? Yes. He didn't mention I was coming? Welcome! Where is Father? He went to see why the power is out. The other buildings seem to have power. Can I offer you something? No... Father was kind enough. You are Mr. Ahmadi's wife? No... But you must be Parviz. Yes. Your father has spoken of you. This apartment has such nice light. I know... But if Father was here, he'd have turned on the lights by now. I know. He was about to turn them on when he realized the power is out. Some people are like that. As soon as it gets a little dark, they throw on the lights. I know... But the light is so nice indoors, this time of day. When it's half-light... Something about it... It's never this way at night or in daylight. You can feel it even better in this apartment because it's high up. You've never sat in this light before? Sure. When Father isn't home, I open the curtains and sit here till it gets dark. Other than this hour, it's only like this near dawn. And people are usually asleep then. It's really something when it's raining or snowing. Especially snow. But... Hi. Hi. It's fixed? It took so long! I couldn't find the super. Well. You two have met. I just got home, too. This is Azar. We are going to be married. You hadn't mentioned anything. It wasn't the right time. Wonderful. Congratulations! I think the elevator's power has a short. Call them up and have them check it out. Ok. You weren't bored, were you? No. I don't have cash at home. We have to collect all the overdue bills today. You used to come twice a year. It's been only two months. Well... The bills being so high and all. What do you want me to do? How much is it anyway? 180,000 tomans. Hang on. But we don't take checks. What do you want me to do? Give me your pen... That notebook too. I'll leave the bearer's name blank so you can cash it yourself. Bye! Bye! Bye! Bye! Hurry up... Come on! Tell your dad I think the breaks need fixing. So, what are you going to do? About what? The wedding. Nothing. What's there to do. I mean, if you need something done, let me know. There's nothing. We'll do it in City Hall. You hadn't mentioned anything about Azar. It didn't come up. How come? Nothing. I was wondering who she is. She's been married before? Yes. She's a good lady. Yes. I swear it's fixed. It can't be more level than this. You call this level? It's still off. A little off is just normal. Even if it levels now, in two weeks it will be a centimeter off. If it's a centimeter off, in two weeks it'll be two centimeters off. Even if I let it pass, Mrs. Rezai won't. Ok. I see what I can do. Check its power, too. I have rented you a place. It's a good place. Belongs to a friend. I'll pay the rent myself. What for? Well, I'm about to get married. You'll be more comfortable this way yourself. I'm comfortable as it is. I don't bother you guys. You can leave any time you choose. I asked my friend to put in some furniture for you. I've lived a lifetime here. We've always been together. I'll wire some money to your account every month. This is still your father's home. You can visit any time. I'm talking about something else Are you kicking me out? Who is it? Who is it? Hi. Hi. When did you move in here? It's a couple of days. You're alone? This is where you check out our house? What do you want? I was just putting up these papers again. My mother works in an office. She doesn't come home till 3:00. Sorry anyway... This is the money for last month plus these last few days. Who can you find more turstworthy than me to drive the kids? You're right. But you don't live here anymore. I'll be here every morning and noon on time. That's not the issue. It's the car... Can you find a car? But I have been returning your wife's car without a scratch all these years. Sure, but I can't give you the car anymore. You mean after all these years... You're sure I said today? Sure. I brought it in four days ago. It says so on the receipt. You're by yourself there? - Yeah. - What are you up to? Nothing... I pass time. I didn't know you'd moved out. Wish you had told us. It was all of a sudden. See? Keep in touch, Parviz. Come visit us. This guy didn't know I'm not here anymore? Sure he knew... What do you want him to say? I don't know... He could say nothing. You think these people notice your absence at all? All these years they've made fun of you behind your back, Now you expect them to get together and cry and say your dad is an asshole? If you were in your dad's shoes, you'd do the same thing. You're sure of that? Well... I'd do the same thing... You should have gotten your act together a long time ago, made yourself a career. Mrs. Rezai was looking for you. She said you should go see her. Parviz, Parviz, Parviz... As the board, we have decided you should no longer be in charge of the maintenance fund. You are not here anymore. It's an extra headache for you. I don't have anything special to do. I come here everyday... I'm always around. No, Parviz. That's not the issue. The fund has to be with one of the residents of the community. What's that supposed to mean? I've spent a lifetime here. Everybody knows me. Everybody trusts me. Right, but if something should happen, we'd be left high and dry. You understand. It's not a small sum. You can't just decide that. You have to ask the others, too. We had a general meeting yesterday. Father was there? Yes. Everyone was there... First the dog issue was discussed. Your father, as always, demanded no one walk their dog on the grounds. They argued for half an hour... Then you were brought up. Everyone voted. I'll bring you the money. Hi. Hi. Congratulations! Thank you. Parviz, you'll come a little early to help tomorrow? - When are your guests arriving? - After 7:00. I'll come with the guests. OK. See you. So what? How long you wanna keep thinking about these things? I don't think about them. Then what do you do? I live. I don't need them. They're the ones who needed me. Your mother knows you come here? Yeah. She told me not to come anymore. You're not scared, going over to a stranger's house? No. Why should I be scared of you? I don't know. If I didn't let you smoke here, would you keep coming? I don't know. Kamran is going nuts. The old lady from 7th floor might have a heart attack. It's lucky the kids weren't poisoned. It's their own doing. Didn't you see them in the meeting? They're psychotic. It's someone from the outside. Some stranger has nothing better to do than poison our dogs? In the forty years I've been in this community, nothing's ever happened to anyone. We'll get them. How you doing, Parviz? Thanks. You know what's happened? Yeah. What are you up to? Nothing. Again nothing. What has to happen for you to get your act together? How long are you gonna hang around... take money form your dad, be these people's bellboy, and have no one take you seriously? Do you want a job? There's a place that's looking for a night watch. No. I've my hands full right now. Bye. With what? You haven't had a real job your whole life! Why did you do this? You thought you could hurt me this way? Isn't this what you wanted? Half the dogs are dead. The others don't dare walk their dogs in the area. Isn't that what you wanted? You think it's a joke? Think you can do whatever the fuck you want? Why don't you go tell them it was me? There will be no more money. If you want money, you have to act like a human being. You shouldn't do that. Because then there will be nothing left between us. Next time you come over, don't bring this thing with you. Where did you get that? You had some clothes in it, I took them out. Why were you messing with my clothes? It's for the dog. He's going to be staying here. What? My mother doesn't let me keep a dog. I want to keep it here. I don't like dogs either. Take it out. What do you want a house this big for? This doesn't take up any room. Where to? Get out of here. You can't keep it here. Take it easy, man. Let it stay for a week. I'll find a place for it. I'll come and take care of him myself. You find him a name. From 12 midnight to 9 a.m. you walk this place. You watch everything. No shopkeepers are to stay overnight. Once an hour you pass by the main entrance. Don't let me catch you napping in a corner. Don't you lock the gate? Sure. We lock the entrance ourselves. So what could possibly happen? This place doesn't have cameras? If it did, they wouldn't pay you to come here and walk around. - Hello, Mr. Akbar - Hi. Starting tonight we have an extra hand. Hi. Hi. - Go plug in the kettle. I'm coming. - Yes. That's Rasoul. He's a good kid, But sometimes he sneaks in a nap. Make sure he stays up. The two of you are not to walk and chat. Each one of you should be on a different floor. Every three hours you can break for tea, but it's back to work after 15 minutes. There are a few other things I'll tell Rasoul to tell you. Yes. OK. What did you name him? Nothing yet. Hey! Stop! Where are you going? What is it? It's you, Parviz? Hello. Hello. Sorry. I saw you walking in the dark... So? Didn't you hear what happened in the complex a few days ago? Someone came in and spread poison everywhere. We're out to catch the bastard. - OK. Now you see it's me. - Yeah. But you don't live here anymore... No. I left a little while ago. What is it? You suspect me? No... It's just that, this late at night... How dare you? I've lived in this community for 30 years. You weren't even born then. Everyone in this complex knows me. Now you suspect me? I'm sorry. Very sorry, Parviz. How're you doing? Fine. Bored yet? No. Let me show you something. Did you have your tea? Yeah. It woke me up. Mr. Akbar gives you only a quarter hour for tea, too? As soon as I drink my tea, he tells me to leave. Don't go toward that store. Don't mind those guys. Who are these people? A bunch of homeless and dayworkers. Mr. Akbar let's them sleep here for money. Does he cut you in? No way. He just doesn't bother me about my napping. He told me to make sure you don't sleep. He never stays up past 2:00. Then conks out till 6:00 in the morning. He pretends not to know about my sleeping. We get along somehow. But he makes good money. Especially winters... If you want to sleep, let me know. No need. I sleep during the day. Lucky you. I make deliveries on my bike all day. It's enough for two meals. Why did you bring this? Nothing to do with me. My mom said to bring it. Your mom? Yeah. She's seen you. Where? I don't know. Let me wash the pots for you to take back. I'll come take them tomorrow. I'm busy now. I'll give a spoonful to the dog. - You know this guy? - No. How about you, you know him? I said don't touch me. I asked what the fuck are you doing in the complex? The hell business of yours is it? I was walking. Cut the crap... answer him. Why are you ganging up on me? What's in your bag? Hey, someone come save this poor kid! Why are you hitting him? Just call the police. Police? They don't know what's going on in here. They'll just let him go... You're killing the poor kid! You stay out of it. If you'd been doing your job people couldn't just walk through the gate. Now I owe you an explanation? Let him go. How do you know it was him? How do you know it wasn't? You know something we don't? I swear I walked in for no reason. Weren't you the one who said it was an outside job? That's no reason to kill the poor kid. That's the attitude that lets anyone waltz in and poison the dogs! Don't touch me! So you're gonna beat up any stranger you find here? For God's sake this isn't right! What's it to you? You didn't lose your dog! I swear it's my first time here. I saw a girl and followed her in. You fucked up coming in! Get him! Hi. Hi. What is it? Nothing. You're well? Yeah. Father is well? Yeah. Why are you following me? I'm not following you. I just happened to see you. Bye. What do you know about my father? Do you know my father has no money? Can I have one? Father knows you smoke? No. I only sometimes do it. Anyway, it doesn't matter anymore. When did he go bankrupt? It's almost a year. Why does he have to give up the apartment? He wracked up a big debt... The bank takes the place. I'm sorry. What for? That you had to leave. I didn't want it to be this way. How long have you been working here? Since they built the place. Your income isn't too shabby either. If you want to keep working here, mind your own business. Oh sure. I'm just saying it's good free money. I've been working since I was six. I have done nothing but work. Now after 60 years, I'm not entitled to a decent income? Maybe Rasoul's been working since he was six, too. So 40 years from now he'll learn how to make money. Man, but you've done a nice job of keeping your business under wraps. Come payday, you and I will make an arrangement. Just don't let Rasoul find out. What are these lies you've told Azar? What about them? What the hell do you want from me? What's the big deal? You don't think Azar wants to marry you for your money, do you? Don't bother her. Leave us alone. The way you left me alone? It's not a good thing at all. If you understood, you wouldn't be saying it. You're fifty years old. Aren't you ashamed of yourself? I am. What are you getting paid for? Other than you three, no one was here. Means one of you is responsible. We were here till morning, like every night. So that window broke itself? The clothes threw themselves on the floor? Maybe it was one of them. One of who? Nothing... I way just saying, maybe... Who? Say what you're saying. I mean a bunch of homeless guys sleep here. What? In the empty store. What is he talking about? He's lying. Nobody sleeps here. What's going on here? Is he telling the truth? - He's lying. - You don't talk! - They're setting me up... - You don't talk! Well, yes. They sleep here at night. The cardboards they sleep on are still in there. Who lets them in? Mr. Akbar. Why didn't you say anything? Mr. Akbar is in charge here. What could we say? Get the hell out! - They're setting me up. - Get out! They're trying to get me fired. They don't want me to be here. I said out. Why are you still here? I told you to leave. Parviz! Get out. Don't you dare mention a word of this to Ashkan! You threw the wool sweater in with the rest? It will be ruined. Which one? Wait for it to come up. That's it, the red one. - Which one? - Wait. You see it? It'll be fine. You've gotten old. You're no good for the job. You worry about yourself. I've worked enough for one lifetime. I'm working now, aren't I? I'm talking in general. Dress well, find a wife, act competent. You're not tired of repeating the same lines all these years? I'm saying it for your own good. You're supposed to get tired of hearing it. I'm incompetent? When I lived here I did half of these people's chores. That was out of incompetence, too. When you take out the sweater, then you'll see. I forgot how terrible these stairs are. Would you like some water or some tea? A glass of water. Here you are. Thank you. You didn't have much furniture either. I've bought a few pieces. They're going to deliver them. I have come to tell you I need this place. You'll have to move out. I know I should have given you an earlier notice, but it just came up. Did Father send you? I rented this place to your father. How much is the rent? I'll pay it myself. That's not the issue. I told you, I need the place. OK. In any case, the waterpipes are busting one by one. Where? The storeroom's totally flooded. It's not even worth fixing. It's not even worth fixing. There. Back there. It's totally flooded. What are you doing? Open this door! Open the door. I'll suffocate in here. Open the door! Open the door! I'll go to the police! What are you doing here? Hi. Hi. Congratulations! How come you didn't invite me? There were only a few people. It was a private wedding at the City Hall. Did you see Mr. Javadi? Who? Your landlord. No. He called. Come in. It's fine here. Don't want to intrude. Why are you sitting here? Either come in or leave. I'm not bothering you guys. Just eating my pastry. Rasoul! Rasoul! Get back to work! I fell asleep a second ago. You can't sleep. What does that mean? It means you get paid to make rounds till morning. Or I'll have them send someone else instead. Man, you've really gone overboard. Even Mr. Akbar would leave me alone. Take it or leave it. I'm the boss now. If you don't get up and go do your job, I'll make sure tomorrow you don't have a job to go to. Parviz, if I hadn't backed you up, you couldn't have set Mr. Akbar up. You could have not. Don't let me catch you sleeping in some corner! Give me some water. Stay as long as you want. I won't bother you anymore. Help! Help! Open the door! Hello. Hi. No. Ashkan isn't here. I don't know. Call his mobile. Well if he wanted to talk to you, he'd pick up. I don't know. He had a date with some girl. No. What's your name? No, it was someone else. No. How am I supposed to know? Bye. Why did you say those things to her? It was none of your business. Next time pick up your mobile. Because I didn't answer my phone, you should say whatever you felt like? Did I lie? Where's the dog? What did you do to him? I'd had enough of it. Your one week was up, too. Where is it? What was that? It's not there. I threw it in the trash. You're lying. What's in there? I'm not lying. It's in the trash. What a quiet night! Yup. It's gotten quiet these days. Can you hang those clothes over there? I don't feel like it. You used to be of some use at least. You enjoy beating me over the head like this? You get offended so quickly these days. I shouldn't be offended? Is it wrong I tell you to dress well, look sharp, get a job, get married? You call what you wear clothes? You don't? Buddy, you don't even own a suit. I say this for your own good. You haven't figured that out all these years? I have. That's why I wouldn't say anything to you. If I hadn't gotten on your case, you wouldn't have gone after this job either. Hi. It's Parviz. How are you? Is Father home? No, I just called to say I'm coming over for dinner. Yeah. Bye. Hi. Hi. Hi. Hi. Why are you standing? Sit down. Why are you drinking from the bottle? I always drank from the bottle. Then I'd always fill it up like this and put it back in the fridge. You're a good cook, you know. Come sit down till the dinner is ready. I'll come. Your bedroom's really messy. Tidy it up a little. Sit down. What's happened? Nothing. Then why have you come? I'm paying you a visit. You're not happy? You used to eat light dinners. Father usually takes his food without salt. I know. This food isn't good for his health. Do you want to do the cooking from now on? I cooked for him for fifteen years. Now it's your turn. Eat your dinner. I have come to talk to you two. I could have had dinner at any restaurant. You always eat so quietly? You have nothing to say to each other? Don't smoke in here! Why? Because I say so. This is my house! I'm your guest right now. Be a tad polite. Take one. Azar doesn't smoke. She does. Just not in front of you. Where to? Get out! - You're kicking me out again? - Out! I'm not going anywhere tonight... Neither are you. Nor is Azar. We want to talk to each other. I've been thinking all this time. About what? Lots of things. Like I said: just us. What do you want? Don't you want to sit next to Father? Well... Will you talk, or should I start? I should start?
