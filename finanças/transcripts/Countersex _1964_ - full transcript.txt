Haven't got the tickets? Why? You could have told me, I would have got them! So we must hurry. Bye. No, exactly at quarter to three. At the ticket office. No, it takes more to say than to do it. I bought this house. It is next to the stadium! Marcella, the pants. No, I'm already on the stairs. Bye. Where're my pants? Ah, yes! - You saw that thing? What? - There, on the wall. On the wall? - Close to that light. What light? This is no time to... Ciccetta, give me some money. What can it be? Where? - There, look. Must be a wasp's nest. How much do you want? - I've nothing. I've to pay for Julius' ticket also. Why pay for him, lend him 5,000 lire instead. He'll remember to return it. - Right. Good girl. Hey, later we'll go to see a film. Select one. I'll bring the newspaper, you check the schedules. It's not a wasp's nest. Maybe snail's. Yeah. It seems it'll rain? I better bring my raincoat. What did you break? Now? What with that ladder? She's set her mind on it. Damn! Now? Say goodbye to the match! Ouch! Damn! Just now it had to happen! - What happened? I moved and sprained a muscle. You'll go out in this condition? - It'll pass. My love. Ouch! I can't. - Lie down, I'll massage you. I can't stand. - Turn around. This time, it makes me really sick. That's it, with open hand. Shortly, it'll pass. - Maybe some muscle's raptured. It hurts? - No, you make me feel good. Good girl. No... not there, baby. You make me feel good there! Even much more. Give me a small kiss... since I like you so much. Since you like me? - This needs justfication. We go inside? - What for? Cicchi-Cicchi. (make love) - And the match? It's not that worthy. You beat 'Modena' football team. But Cicchi-cicchi during the day? - Is there a time-table? No, but... - Shall we? And those blinds? - You care? They jammed and you know that... I, in the light... We go to the living room. - No. We'll break nothing. We'll be alert. Tonight. Come on, tonight. And if I adjust them? - The houseman couldn't... Houseman makes me laugh! I may need a ladder. We need a carpenter! - Of course not! I'll save you the carpenter's expense. Happy? Carpenter? This needs a scientist! Fixing it right away. What are you doing? It's pasted to the wall with tape. - Marcella, leave it! Why? - It is on Admiral's wall. Come on, come down! It's a finger glove with some stuff inside. You put it? What did you conceal? - Nothing. What is it? - A medicine. Pasted to the wall? - Needs outside's temperature. It is a vaccine. Now put it back to its place. Stop! Don't smell it! Better not. What is this stuff? It is cocaine. Coca...? - Ine. The teams enter the field. Marcella, what're you thinking? What you've in your head? You don't think that... I quit smoking and now I take cocaine? Marcellina, come here. I do have it but I swear it is not for me. You trust me if I swear? Look at me! Look at me. My face is of a cocaine addict? You close the room. I'll explain. But it is worse, you get angry then. Why do I've it? It's a pledge. I lent some money to Fracassi, against this as a guarantee. He was worried, he goes to trial in protest, poor chap! How much you gave? - You know its worth? About 100 thousand lire! - But how much you gave? I gave to get back what he never returned. 20,000? - 50. For few months. They goaled. You can't lend so much money without telling me. If I had told, I couldn?t have lent him. But you're right. It could've been worse. An addicted husband. Better addicted than an idiot - It's a favor. Stupid, selfish, snobbish. A thief! Why, a thief? - Yes, thief! Making me say nasty things. - For example? I earn, money is mine. - And then? That's it! You can't live thinking of yourself only! We're not animals! We've to think about others too. It's a pleasure. I can't afford such pleasures. I would love to. I'm better than you... but two humanitarians in a house is too much... it's always me who acts as a selfish monster. You didn't buy a house for me. And even the plot in Fregene, - Alright! I feel ashamed that I stopped you... from getting your mom's dentures made. And you lent 50,000 lire to a drug addict! You know where he lives! - At Hope & Trade. What a man! - He's not an addict... took once and got sick. And if money isn't the issue, you like him. Remember how he made you laugh at the races? Wasn't that for free! His is doing good, soon he'll return the money. I'm going, Julius is waiting for me. Hope & Trade Hotel? Mr. Fracassi, please. What're you doing? - I'll talk to him. So suddenly? On phone? - Okay, I'll talk to him. He is not taking it. It is Sunday today, he'll be at the race course. And I'll call him tonight tomorrow, five times a day... until he returns money and takes his cocaine! Shut up. Want this to be a news? - Hello? Hello? Mr. Fracassi, please. I'm his friend, Sandro Cioffi. Dr. Sandro Cioffi. - It's ok! Fracassone! Why? No, I... with whom? They want me to talk to the director. It's me. It's me, looking for him. Well, a friend. I hardly know him. No, no. I tell you. No. What they want? - They're saying that... he's gone. Didn't pay half a million. They're accusing, and looking for him. Now what about this? - It is ours now. We sell it, recover money. - Sell it? To Whom? No idea, to a doctor, a pharmacist. This isn't selling, this is peddling. We'll go to jail. You know "Regina Coeli" jail? - Then you tell me. If we can't sell it, then what purpose this guarantee serves? What is its value? - If found here, I'll go to jail. You can't mess with this stuff. That's why I had pasted it on admiral's wall. And you just phoned! I'm his friend, I gave my name! You said "cocaine" on phone. They'll come searching. If this is useless, better throw it then! Don't! It's dangerous. We must make it disappear. In the toilet. Give it to me. 100,000 lire in the toilet? It's better than going to jail. I won't throw 100,000 lire in the toilet. Nothing else can be done! Even when I throw dry bread I kiss it thrice! Kiss it then and throw it away. - Don't throw the grace of God. You've chicken's brain. Give it to me! As per you, not waste it but give it to a poor man? We give it to the orphans or we take it? For not losing 50,000 lire we become addicts? Give me! Damn you and your greed! Give it to me! Idiot, you and your cocaine! - Shut up! There! - What've you done? To make you learn! How much you took? Damn, almost half! - It's a lot? I don't know! Quick, blow your nose! I've no handkerchief! - Never mind, with fingers! No! I'll spoil the floor! - Why care! With the robe! Great! Again! Harder! A little came out. How do you feel? Cold. - How? Chill in my nose. Inside! Is it? - Yes, what else you want it to be? God, what an idiot! - Now you see! What you made me do! Help me, Sandro! - How? - Any antidote? Milk, vinegar? Never mix them, be on your back. Why? - You feel better. Lie down. You're leaving me? - I'm geting the encyclopedia. What will it say? - Wait, let me check it! Another goal! What I missed today! What does it say? - Be good. Don't agitate. I'll check. "Coal, Chinese, coca cola, cocaine." "A drug used in ancient times by the natives." I can't see! That's all? Show me! Nothing, there's only a chemistry formula. - Half a page! "Cocaine lose its effect by excessive washing." Come on. "State of passion, strong trend of sensual joys... mainly in women." - Okay, I wish... "Moral degeneration, elimination of inhibitions." It breaks inhibitions. - What will I do? You'll be ok, wash yourself. Nothing will happen. What will I do? - I'm here I'll take care. You control me? Looks as if only God knows what I've done! Then you tell me. - Sandro, I'm afraid. If you love me, you take it too. Me? If it brakes me free, who knows where we go crashing! Better you take it too! Sandro, don't leave me with cocaine! If I repel you, you repel me too. You never repel me... damn who's there now? Who cares! I'm going bizarre! You forever say worse! Let me see who there is. Police. - No, your sis and her boy friend. Don't open for them! Must be having dinner. The radio is turned on. What're you doing? - See, he turned it off. Marcella! Sandro! - Coming! Coming! Oh, my tongue! Sandro, help! I send them away with some excuse. - Sandro, my tongue. You bit your tongue? - No, it's swollen. Better I lock you inside. What? - Tie me to the bed as in 'The Man with the Golden Arm.' No time! - Swear, you also take it later. Come on. - Come on. Ringing the bell for long? Raffy, nice guy! I was bathing, Marcella is away. I'm going out too, damn! I'll see the match. I'm close to the stadium but always get late. For once, don't go to the match. - Yes? Come on. Corrado wanted to be with you. - We can talk in the lift. Lift! We go on foot. - At least take this egg. Nice big egg! Come on. - You take it to the stadium? Rita, Raffy's got locked inside. Corrado brought you this egg from Turin. - Good guy. This egg is made by a factory that served Camillo Benso di Cavour. Really? Wait a minute. Come in, don't stand at the door. Where can I keep it? Not good there. You've a small card? - I'll ask her tonight. It would require a base of same diameter. - Where will I find it? Here's Raffy! - It is well kept in the vase? Perfect, the egg of Columbus! - Where's the phone? I don't want Conrad to make a useless visit. I'm late. - Go, I'll close the door! No, who'll lock it? Call, it's already late! I prefer Treccani, the best encyclopedia. If you've it, you've it all. What were you searching? Coccyx. - Coccyx. The sacrum bone. This morning I had pain... What the hell! Stop! You crazy? He didn't spoil, just licked it. - Yes. There's aunt Enrica and also Uncle Raphael. - Let's go then. Bye, I'll see you. Call Raffy. - Raffy, mom's love! Raffy, darling! Keep it on leash, this fucking... You've a dog? - Yes, remains locked, it is very wild. Shut up, idiot! It?s a she dog. Shut up, sit! Stay! Stay! Stay! - A woman. Yes. But she must stay locked. - Who is she? Forget it. Wait, I'm coming too. It is Marcella! What you want me to be? That's all, you don't see anything. Yesterday we had can food and I got rashes. I had to go to the bed, I was not presentable. But what are you doing here? Go to the terrace, I'll come too. I was all over. - No, you just began. Any drink? Coffee, tea, juice. - Please, a coke. I didn't tie you to the bed. - Why? I'm good. What? Did you take it? - What? Don't restart? Stop it! I get it. You don't want to take it, you are a coward. Come down. What do you want? - You take it now ... or I'll tell this captain when did your sister run away... and stayed with a communist artist for 15 days in Paris. Don't be silly, he will not marry her anymore. Rita, Corrado, Sandro will fetch a coke. You may prefer a French liqueur, but I've none. Not even a bit of Vichy water. Corrado brought you this egg from Turin. Thanks. Take it! Cavour ate them, it's an ancient artifact! Marcella! - Thanks, you're so nice. Broken, sorry. Marcella, you are not well, go to bed. We see surprises. - Speaking of surprises. There's one for you. What were we to tell Corrado? Okay, go! - Where? To have Coca-Cola. - The surprise! Fantastic! Where's the baking soda? Let's do with this. Damn to Fracassi! What a lovely Sunday! Well done! - Couldn't you stay in the room? How much did you take? - No idea, two or three sniffs. More, more. - I want no more! If you're ashamed, I won't look at you. You took? - Enough? Wait. - What're you doing? Wait. - It?s the first time, it may hurt. Everything, everything, inhale! Damn! - You feel cold? No, it burns me! - You'll see in a while. Marcella, my head is throbbing! Water! Where's the water? How it burns! The cocaine was better! What the hell they put in, muriatic acid? Look, here baking soda was! Marcella, you're disgraceful! - What now? My God! I even make balloons! O, yes... it is soap! Sandro, your wife's gone mad. - Why? She told Corrado about Paris, Gilbert, everything! She told him! - What did I do to her! Do something! What can I do, kill her? - It?s an offence, a crime. Enough! You both have annoyed me. Corrado, let me finish, I've very clear views. A woman has experiences and most of them are bad. I don't oppose freedom of women... but political idealogy. - But the communist who converts... Marcella, since you entered the room, I wished to say 'don't argue.' You should thank me because I had the courage to say so. There would be consequences in marriage. Wretch! Corrado! Never seen a sick person? - Good morning, Admiral. Why did you tell him? - You ask? I had cocaine. Baby, we must pass these two or three grave hours. Now I make two lovely cups of strong chamomille. We drink, we go to bed and try to sleep. You wake up and it's all over. - The window! The window! - Oh God, Marcella! The window! - Stop yourself! What are you doing? - It's Raffy. Why barking so much? It is also doped . - It has an effect. Like you. - But you'ave nothing? I took after you, it takes some time to react. Hurry up otherwise you're just annoying. How is Modena's goal keeper? I like when he springs, throws himself on the ball and catches it. Since when you got interested in goal keeper's gallop? Forget it. You don't have even a hair on your chest. What do you mean hair on my chest? I never ever had. What is this new...? - Forget it. - I've already given up on Modena's goal keeper... but hair on my chest, you need to explain me. Perhaps, you like hairy? - I like lot of things. But alas at the moment... how far we are! Good bye. I'm a man of understanding, modern, I realize your plight. What you do or say I'm not bothered, I know you're not normal. What are you doing? Possibly you can't control yourself? What is this crap? Being a Neapolitan street urchin? And my words have no use! I'm leaving, I leave you alone! Sorry, I'm nervous. For the first time in 5 years of marriage I slapped you. I can't see you like this, I want to help, but you don't co-operate. What to do, call a doctor? And tell him what? "Excuse me, doctor, we took cocaine and my wife can't stand up now." I can't stay here and see you do obscene things! In two hours you may wreck this wedding! - You've no effect. Listen. Come here, look at me. We love each other, right? - Yes. We're in love with each other. - Yes. Neither you nor I've done any harm to each other, right? What does it mean rapsberry? What do you mean, yes, no... Enough is enough. Please don't do that. Stop it! Better I also had taken that much! How long yet? Listen to that concert! I can't hear you, you repel me! You repel me! You already said so! I like you. Sandro, I'm all alone. You're still far away from me. Hurry up, make it happen. I don't want be alone anymore. - It?s a word, with soap! Make that effect happen! I don't want to be alone anymore! But what's this crap? Is it possible to ease this way? What have you done to me! You know nothing! - Hurry up, Sandro! Let that effect happen. - Marcella! Marcella, you made me do Arabesque? I've done it three times, Give me the finale. Wonderful, eh? Can't you finish, honey? - I like it this way. I've an idea, let's dance together then you finish it. I can't stand so, let's do things. What do we do? - We can do everything. Just choose, I've been at the point for half an hour. It is not necessary to take cocaine to be at the point! Let's make love? - If you say Cicchi-Cicchi ... Now we think bit alike. - Yes. So now one thinks of something and speaks. I'm ready. - Me too. What did you think? - Going to put black stockings. Damn! - And what did you think? Thought of taking a bath together. And the black stockings? - Better! Such as rice weeders. Do you have a straw hat? Jump to get the black stockings, I fill the tank. Get the black stockings, I fill the tank. I fill the tank. Don't forget your hat. Where is the bathroom? Ah! In Rome, Roma-Modena 0-0. Young man! Order! - What's done by the Roma team? 0 0. - But I heard at least 4! I don't know. - Don't know? So why were you screaming? - I didn't go. He did not go. You drugged them! Me? - Yes, you! Criminal, rascal. And don't look at me with that crazy face! But fuck you! - Well! Great! Just great! I'm speaking French! Now he speaks French. I wonder what all comes to his mind! We can't do, no hot water supply. Yes, I turned off the water heater. - Damn, you ruined everything! You've torne the curtain. - I don't care about the curtain. Care about stockings? - Fine black stockings! You dress superbly during mourning! My mind is going wild. Really? We'll play the game of love and death. I already visualize you. As a LOVE by d'Annunzio. (Poet) On a catafalque, lying amidst many candles. Here is the Christmas' tree-box. - The Christmas tree? The candles! The candles! He tore the curtain. Oh God! I feel dizzy. I feel dizzy. I feel dizzy. All naked underneath. - But hurry. Okay, count to 15. Oh God, I will pull all ... the eye! All teeth out! I look like Dracula. Oh God! I cannot die anymore, I?m pregnant. - What did you say? I'm pregnant. - And when did it happen? I didn't tell you because you'd be scared. For 5 years I keep it here. But we cannot now, we won't have more fun. We'll do it later. You say 'later' since 5 years! Oh God! - What is it? I want to throw up. - But if we have postponed the baby...! Where is the bottle? - Go to bed, forget about it. But I feel really bad! What do you want from me? So we do here, you're more comfortable. If you feel bad... - Don't you see? We do here. I'm going to get the candles? Throw them away, I cannot see them anymore. Even on next Christmas we'll be alone just like two idiots. We are still not in time for Christmas, We'll do it for Easter. Let's do it, come on. If he is born on Easter in '75 he'll be in the middle school. In '80, in the high school, in 83 if there's no war in the University. Damn, I'm old! I get candles? - Ugh! Do me a favor, leave me alone. I passed the mark! - I've not what can I do? I don't know if you've lot of energy, adjust the shutter. Of course not the shutter! The shutter! I destroy you! Do you wait for the carpenter? No! Slow! Slow! My head is splitting! Ive had enough from this situation! Do you see? What do I do now? The carpet is almost over, what can I do now? With this I've already saved another 29,700. Then what have you done? Did you unstop the sink also? Yes, and I've polished the taps. We've saved other 2000. - Hello? Hello, Mom, how are you? Yes, Corrado. What has he done, ditched Rita? Poor fellow! It settles everything. But then what's wrong? The dog? Why is it dirty? He attacked two little doggies? 10 or 12? How? Even a goat? Ah, it has just tried! What do you mean 'kill him'! It is a lucky dog indeed! Now I've to go. Bye, mummy. To level with 50 000 lire, we need 17,000 more. Under which 'head' do I put them, "various", "unforeseen"? Put them under "Sunday's entertainment" Time out kids, home-work. In order. I said, in order. Miss Riduttini. Miss Riduttini, I'm speaking to you. Hand it over. I've not finished yet. - Hand over whatever is done. One line only, sir. - Time is finished. A single line. - Don't force me to this stupid game of power. So you win. Don't cry, we know each other since 3 years. You go. Girls, I told you not to go. What does he want? - At your desks. I say silently. You already know what news-papers say about outrageous extremes, the volatility shown by certain young people. I've some news' clippings that I'll show now. A student was provided with a transmitter in the exams... to pass on text to a mate. A university student compromised with her professor, then blackmailed him. Buying and selling of notes in a school. I refuse to believe that my girl-students can get to... a similar scandalous compromises. I just want to remind you that next year you'll be teachers... and that your duty is essential, yesterday as now. More than a duty, it's a mission. Tomorrow you'll be called to educate children. You'ill be there to guide their young minds... and along with their parents, build their character. You can't educate and perform so exquisitely a civil duty... without honesty and sense of responsibility. Your mission is fundamental and essential. Try to be worthy. I warn you that to protect my honesty and liability, I will imply, if necessary, all appropriate measures. Good day, sir. - What a greeting? He didn't let you copy the topic! To our, professor. Now what're you doing? - Putting talc on him. No, I'll do it! Give me some talc, give me the talc. I'd give a punch on her head! You've done his feet and I put the talc on them. What're you doing? Throwing it all! What're you doing? - Let her do it, grandma. She is unable to put even talc! Grandma, you know we've to go out. - Going to change you. - Let's go. I finish up here. I bring this. - Hurry, You take 3 hrs. to climb the stairs! How beautiful is our baby! - Beautiful, just beautiful! Grandma's boy, need anything? - No, thanks. What'ree you having? The Marsala? Have it. Good for you, make you better. Go and change. I'll fix a few home works and come. Don't stand here and watch me as a fool. - Don't work too much. Leave him alone, come on in! From where will you buy the stole? - Cappellini Store. From? - Are you deaf? From Sisters Cappellini. Sisters Cappellini always have crickets on their mind. Never mind, I tell you. It?s dark. We see nothing. - Who is it? It's me. Sit down, lady. - Sit here, Grandma. Tell me, professor, which fair wind brings you here? I've come to see the cabinet that I saw the other day. It is in that corner. - You're eating, I wont disturb. Would you like to have some? - Goodness no. I'll come back. I don't mind, I'm pleased, I suffer from loneliness. Is the cabinet still there? - It is in that corner. I'll see it, thanks. - If you don't mind, I eat. Grandma, you like it? It is bit worn out, but then... We can be rest assured about the authenticity? - Sure. I got it from an old Countess, pure Empirial style. Open it and look as well. - Please eat. A bell? - No. Our ancestors were cultured, you agree? The aristocratic Empirial style. Any idea about the purpose it served? - Yes, you already told me. For their bodily needs, they rested, they sat down.... I know. - Look, the coat on arms is still new, untouched. Yes, of course, the piece is peculiar. - Exactly. I was worried about the authenticity. - It's genuine. We must'nt have these these talks between us. We know each other well, so... take it home, find it if it's good for you... we'll talk. All right, professor? Excuse me, I've pasta which is getting cold. - Please. How can you live by selling this stuff? Madam, what do you want... You've to buy me... - You come along, I'm not expert at certain things. You know that I've some memories. - Don't be boring, grandma. I'll help you cross the street. I'll wait for you at the Ricobaldi Caf?. Please, come fast and be careful as you cross the street. Ok,I'm not a stupid woman. Good morning, Professor. - Good morning, Ms. Cappellini. Grandma? - She?s been buying things, but will come now. While you wait, you may read this newspaper. - Very kind. Excuse me for a moment. - Please. How are you today, sir? - Did they bring you 'two steel wools'? We should have a war to have one. - The usual ice cream. They invented plastic with the invention of the century. Professor, Doctor. - Yes? Listen, "The Labor Ministery intervenes for the truce... between doctors and the mutuals. Does this news interest you, want to look? Professor, I would like to ask you a great favor. - Please. Can I bother you for a moment? It's not for me I ask, it is a matter of conscience. I'd like to ask yoo a wish. Will you do it for me? May I? - Please. It's about the case of Ms. Marcelli, the daughter of the man who went away with the saleswoman. Yes, I know. - It?s a real disaster for that family. If you could help her... - I'm sorry for Ms. Marcelli. People can ask me anything, but not on exams. I'm strict. Will you have a cigarette? - Sorry, I don't smoke. It?s a matter of conscience. - No. I'm surprised at you, baron. Here. - Thank you, professor. You should not thank me, but the accountant Capriccioli. My thanks. Very kind. Have, boy, have. Have you seen the motherhood? What a wonderful thing! And then come the troubles. But... look... it's wonderful. Great, congratulations. - Thank you. What a fantastic show, motherhood is so profound. Something huge. Why don't you mind your business? - Madam, I am praising you! Simply Absurd, - Why? - Man is a strange animal. His life is fully dominated by sex. In all, he sees the hidden agenda, the sinful desire. Reminds me of a strange thing happened a few years ago in Terni. At that time I was a substitute. On some restaurant's terrace, a very young and pretty girl... was holding a baby like a parcel. It seemed strange to me that a girl so young, 17 or 18 years, could already be married with a child. When I looked at her, she opened her blouse and offered her breast to the baby. Professor, your grandma can't select without you, if you want to come... I knew it, ok, I'll be right there. The girl? - Ah, yes. I inquired later. She was unmarried and almost certainly a virgin. The child was not hers, it was her sister's. I'll be back later. I'll pay later. Good evening, Professor, we're bringing the cupboard. Slowly, Evelina! Professor, grandma could not explain. She told me about a hygienic bowl. This is perfect as a measurer. Look, professor. No! - Now it is used in this way. Your grandma's selecting a pot for stew. I didn't want an object like this. I... you know... I wanted to... a majolica vase, in ceramic, something vintage. So come down, you'll surely find something that is good for you. This company is one hundred years old and you'll find something in our store room. Grandma, what are you doing there? - Come and see. It's ok that I'm old... - I had also given you the measures. What did I tell you to buy? - It?s still of my father's time. I sent you here for something else. - I bought it because we need it. Why embarass me with a scene? - We need this. That's a hygienic thing I imagined wrongly. - Come. Professor, most of the stuff in this room is old. This looks perfect to me, see. Mrs. Rose - I'm coming! It's not nice, I prefer something in chinaware, more sturdy. Have a look, professor. - Okay, I do. Professor, found it? - Not yet. Look behind, near the bottles. Here. I wonder what purpose that chair could serve! It could serve me, something repulsive, but I was forced. Give me this 'zipeppe', Come on! - No, I wont give you! Up for a vase! Let her place it. She has to win! Like a little girl! Happy? Now I'll show you the amazement! Is it ok for you? The whole afternoon she was like this. Take the wife and I come with you. And she remains here to do the puzzles. - Yes, good. But now you've to go to bed. You too, Grandma. We need not always create a scene, think of the neighbors. Don't shout, don't shout! I'll distribute, professor. - Yes. Girls, yesterday I got curious to take a note... and checked all those of you who came out of the classroom. Seats! Be seated. Seven of you... Do not laugh! Seven of you've got the permission to leave the class. Curiously, these seven have handed in the best schoolwork. I don't think that you've any gain by this way out... to check the textbook. Yet, what has occurred is, it has further firmed my recent decision.. If any of you want... you may sit in here. Do not laugh! Behave, we're in the classroom. Basically I'm your teacher. Stop! I don't think that's the case... what is vital now is that your essay has been sensible, the clear evidence of your good preparation. It's enough! Quiet please! Believe me, you've pushed me to a very embarrassing situation. The essay starts now. Comment on Dante's phrase "and then we went to see the stars". Already finished for you? - Sure. I am ashamed. - You can't keep it. You go then! - Sure. Be silent, please. Zanetti, what have you to say? - Professor, can I go in? Go, go! Thank you, professor. Why thank? Go, go. I wouldn't have gone there. With a piano and a violin ... It?s her! - Who? Saw her? This time I'll stop her! - But who? How beautiful she is! A wonderful woman. But she's always in a hurry! I'll stop her. - Are you crazy? Why? - Stopping a woman like that on the road? She befools you. - You think so? Let me try. Sorry. Idiot! It was for me. Excuse me. - Yes? Nothing. - Good. If you don't tell me now, I'll never ask you anymore. I wished to know you, but you've always been in a hurry. That's right, unfortunately I always have plenty of things to do. Even today, as always, I'm late for my first appointment. I may visit you. Have a business card? - Sure. No. I'll scribble it. - If you want to. Now. My address? - Yes. Musician? - Yes. Artist? A good ear, really musical. I'll be with you at 4 p.m. I'll be punctual! If I lose the ticket, what will I do? What's your name? Giovanna. Giovanna who? - What a style, eh? She's wonderful. - I never thought that a woman with such elegance... could get rid of a nuisance. At 4... - At 4, there's a rehearsal of the orchestra. At 4? Ah, you! I was leaving! I've a clock that is moving behind. It is 4 for every one. Hurry, every one is already here. No, the oboe is missing, Mr. Michelucci. What to do? - Call Zandri and replace him. Okay. Has she already arrived? Who? - The beautiful unknown. The beautiful unknown? Yes, you imagine! I don't think of her anymore. I knew that she wouldn't come. You think me to be so naive that I'll believe that she'll come? Already set flowers and champagne? Don't joke, you begin rehearsing the parts, I'm coming! I was just playing. This is telepathy. Yeah. Thanks. I'm a bit late. I never expected a traffic jam because of the procession. I hate to keep anybody waiting. Me too, but sometimes, due to the circumstances... Exactly. May I come in? - Please. Please. Perfect! Perfect! Simply perfect! Do we have a nice view also? - The bell tower. Magnificent. A lovely penthouse. I wasn't wrong about you. A man of your charm has to match a house like this. I always trust my first impression, it never disappoints me. Excuse me, I allowed myself bring some flowers for you. For me? Thanks. I can tell you one thing? - Please. In the first meeting of love, flowers make wonderful accomplices. I should have thought of it. Do you have an Amphora? - An Amphora? Yes, a vase, a bowl. - Ah, for the flowers! Behind. I think there is one. Artist! - Drink? I'll make something. With pleasure. - What do you prefer? Anisette, tea, port, whiskey, cognac, sherry... champagne. What? - Don't you know the cocktail "The kiss of Venus"? Of course I do! - Meanwhile could I make a phone call? Sure. I only regret that the phone is in the bedroom. Why sorry? It?s very comfortable. The phone plug is disconnected. - Don't bother, I'll do it myself. Meanwhile, you prepare me the cocktail, but not too strong. Alcohol makes my head go loose. - I'll take care. Kiss of Venus. Alcohol 45 degrees. Hello? Who is it? Please, the attorney's office. Maestro, can I give your number? Maybe they'll call me for something urgent. - Sure. You're an angel. No! I am for simple and elementary situations. Especially reports should be clear from the very start. There is only one way to approach this situation. One behaves in a certain way and he is interpreted differently. It's useless to tell you certain things, because... I don't want pepper, I want an ashtray. An ashtray. We had agreed to exact terms and you look for an excuse... of not observing them. Mister, why haven't you stripped yet? It is not cold. I waited because... I believe in the theory that one should enjoy every step. Now it's better Mr. Marchetti. You see we've begun to know each other? Don't go, come here. - Here? The plot cannot cost less than 20 millions that is located ... Here. - It is located in Casalmaggiore, you know it well. Anyway I can't fail on my words now. You must take account of my stance and don't let me down. My dear, let's conclude. My time is precious. I'm in Rome for only 24 hours and I've to see many things, so many. Ministries, personal practices, measurements. If you do a thing like this, you mess up the entire deal. Where are you going? Come here. Good guy, in a minute I'm all for you. - Please. Marchetti, I couldn't imagine. The land has a value of 200 millions, yes or no? The urban town planning has been approved. The parceling out is common and you waste time by being a fussy person. No! If it is this way, forget it! I'm sorry, dear Mr. Marchetti, you're not behaving like a gentleman. What?? You think this business doesn't interest me anymore. I decided to tell your partners that it will be for another time. There will be some occasions for sure. Good day! The thing that gets me more tired is the need to mix constantly... the affairs with my private life. I would like to live in a wild, desert place... under a large deep blue sky. Alone, all alone. Alone? - Alone with you. Instead, I've an agency of houses and lands... and if I don't keep my eyes open my workers make me lose millions. Understand? - Sure. So, I'm a slave of my own business. But now don't think about that darling. Enough of business. I'll not utter a word that is not loving. I promise. - No, I like you also because you are a modern woman. Perform. You think it will be approved by the law of expropriations? I'll vote against it. Want me to answer? - Okay. If it's for me, I?m not here. - Hello? Who is speaking? It's you! I just spoke with that miser Marchetti. I should tell that penny pincher for that plot in Casilina... I got a regular subdivision and now he creates a problem. I tried to convince him, but he still looks undecided. A brief phone call. - It?s the truth, it's not possible. Send him away. Kill him. - As you like. He is not the right man to wrap up with unless he is forced to... have his back to the wall! How? No, he's a real bungler. No! Of course I was tough with him! I know, but you must not withdraw. You must not. What? What a narcissus skin, stop the call. I know how to make you forgive me. This does not mean that he is a petty, mean-spirited man. I cannot understand... - It's always me. It's been a waste of time, I don't like dealing with such people. He hesitates constantly and he doesn't know that business is a serious matter. I'm going to impose charges on him, he deserves that! Track down Commander Roberti, I want to see you at once. Don't move, I?ll be by you in a moment. What's the matter? Going now? Yes, I want to teach Mr. Marchetti a lesson. Please, maestro. To that local! I've many clients, why should I have so much patience with him. I'll send the lawyer. We've to define all from the legal point of view too, I'll be there. Finished? - Yes, keep it down. Excuse me, Maestro. You've understood. - Good heavens, what a torment! Look what had to happen to us! Right now we wanted to stay a bit quiet. What are you doing, sitting naked? Won't you join me? I don't think my presence could help. Please, come with me. Don't you like me anymore? We'll spend just a moment at my office and then we... It can't end like this between us. Come soon. I should make a call. - Make it from the street. Have a car? - Yes. Dress yourself and let's go. Do we return here? - Yes. Put the second gear if you want to take the turn well. Better warn me if you change. What's the matter? Since we left you said nothing nice to me. Don't you like me anymore? Ever made love in Chinese style? How is the Chinese style? - Turn there, in the lane! I can't, it says 'prohibited'. - How obedient you are! An artist like you should drive with more imagination. Go, there is no policeman even! What do you think can happen? Go! - Quiet, I'm going. We hit something? Stop at the corner there, at the tobacconist. - Have we arrived? No, I've to buy a stamp paper. I do it right now. I get down too, I have to call. - The tobacconist has no telephone. Call from this boutique. - Which one? This, on the right. It has a phone. - Okay. Quite difficult to stop here, buy me three pairs of lace panties. I am not an expert. - Like these, you've already seen them. The French model, you can't be wrong. So in a double row we take up all the road. You're not an artist. Even Beethoven paid fines. Can I help you? - Telephone. What telephone? - To call. Ah...come in. Since I?m here three pairs of French panties. We only have women's clothing. They are for my wife, the French model. May I? - Why not? Excuse me, what color you prefer? - Serious. Yes. Armando? There has been a problem. We must postpone. Problem is right here. Everybody is here and I don't know how to hold them. I want no drink! You must come now! We've only two rehearsals. And tonight we'll be on air! What are you doing? Where are you? I'm at the hospital. In a medical clinic, women's department. My relative, later I'll tell you. Meanwhile, you begin to rehearse. I'll be there at... 6 p.m. Sir. Excuse me, sir. Excuse me, you didn't tell me the size. Yes, the size. A little more moderate than that. A bit more heartfelt than this, but... it is more round. Don't worry about the car, I know the major general of road system. They'll bring home your car and you'll not even pay the fine. Fantastic, you live here? - No, just my office is here. Tell me an exciting word, daring. Not bad but I know more awful words. There are 5 floors. Maestro, wipe your mouth! During negotiation, please try to support me. Keep this. It needs a little bit of intrigue in business. Clean your neck. Here we go. What are these maps? - The plan 50. Mr. Marchetti, you make so many problems in this deal, Maestro Spadini is willing to refund the deposit... and replace you. - If you permit, madam... No, the lawyer Maestro has been anxious to start since weeks. It is true that you offered 3 millions under the table to blow the deal? Blowing... - Don't have ethics, business is business. Maestro Spadini has with him even the stamp paper. Considering that Mr. Marchetti gave up. At this point, I give up. Maestro, don't waste time. Sign at once. Sign the compromise. The deal is yours. - Wait, don't hasten things. Madam... - The Commander has just asked... It?s the fourth time he has asked again just something. He has no ethics, Maestro, I've proposed the deal. The contract, sign it. I've to sign. Excuse me! - What excuse? Excuse you. Arduini, has the surveyor come up with the plan ? Madam, let's think. - No, I'm tired of thinking. Commander! - Happy? So I lose 5 million lire. How could I presume that this... - What this? Excuse me, but your tongue here was just clumsy. Why? - You knew that we were dealing with business. Business is business. My Money is worth as those of the Marquis! It?s always clumsy. - I had offered more, if you want to know! Madam has found an excellent partner. - Thank you. Where is madam? - She?s gone away, but don't worry, You come tomorrow during cash time for a gift. You are here! - Mr. Marchetti has signed? Yes, they also wanted to tip me. See, how easy it was? You've been a treasure. Yes, I must go now. Didn't you've another dress upstairs? I wanted to surprise you, so I changed it for you. Now I'm yours, take the car and take me to your home. The car? The taxi. - It reminds me I've to call the Police Commissioner. Mr. Arduini, we've no car, you take us. Hurry, the surveyor is waiting. - I don't want to go. Tell him I'll see him tomorrow. - But you only fixed the appointment. But I can't leave. Maestro Spadini! Send the surveyor to hell. - And the engineer Busardo? God! The engineer! Okay, Arduini. Have patience. Let me get rid of this nuisance. Then no one can disturb us anymore. It's not very far. We're in open country side! Darling, a plot to dole out is surely not in Spain's Square! I wish! You knew it worth! I'll do it at once. I suggest you. The surveyor has gone to a village, 6 km away. She says he waited so long. - He was angry! We should call him. - Come now! It is 6 p.m. Go away! He went to eat! - Want to go there? Somebody has to. You go and let him finish eating, maybe you eat too. I've already eaten. There must be a phone. Call engineer Busati in Milan, tell him that Marchetti has signed... as we wanted. Remember the number? 543272. Is there a strong man in the home? - My son. See, how pale looks that gentleman? We should put him on a bed, but I don't think he can do it alone. Alfredino! - Mom! A lightning could take you, why are you screaming? Now you go to bed. - Why? I feel great. I hope so. - Get up! What is it? Put me down! - I wont make you fall! Maestro, I'll hold the head. Slow, careful with the legs. - Well done. What is this madness? - Better, undress him. Blood flows better. Don't be shy, don?t have useless decency. We are at friend's house. - Leave me in peace! Leave him alone. - He?s a nervous type. I send them away, so you rest. It's better. Madam. You noticed the red spots? - Where? On his face and neck. I rest with him. We must be careful. It can be dangererous, very infectious. Here? Don't you smell the scent of the countryside? So wild! Do you smell it? - Here I cannot!! No! And I'm not interested! Liar! Thief! Thief! My kitty! I undress myself! - Don't miss these moments! The jacket! I feel forced! Mrs. Giovanna! - Who is calling me? It's me, Giovannino. - No, it's from the outside. How from the outside? Who is calling me? - Balducci, the surveyor! Oh, the surveyor! - Where are you going? The surveyor has come! - Who cares! I'll be back, you don't divert. - And, no! And, no! I get down now! - Am going crazy. You can't do this. It is not serious. Good evening, madam. - Ah, Mr. Balducci. I thought you will return with Mr. Arduini. - Yes, madam. They couldn't get connection to Milan before an hour. I?ve been waiting since morning. - It's been a good idea. Come, I'll explain everything so we don't waste time. The land to be doled out would be this one... The groups must be divided by a large road. For a project like this, it needs 20 days. - Not so many. The cost will be around million lire. - No way! 10 days for the project, the cost must not exceed 400000 lire. Tell Mr. Arduini to wait for the communication quietly. What contagious disease? - He has red spots. What red spots? It might be lipstick! Giovanna, tell them! - Who called the ambulance? There's ad anger of infection because of lots of animals! It?s a mishap! - I am Maestro Spadini, even if... The ministry closes at 6, with the siren and the lights open... in twenty minutes we'll be in town. Do we leave at once? - Yes, want to come in? A relative? - Very close. Go in the front, the sick is better isolated with me. What a way! Driver. Why have we stopped? - A traffic jam. Where are we? - Looks Venice Square. Can you go via Twenty Settembre street? Why via that? We are going to San Giovanni hospital. I've to go to the ministry, it's late. - You kidding? You can't. - What a pity! I'll get down here, otherwise it closes. - Yes, I get down too. Where are you going? - I've to make a call. This is crazy! - Where do I get a phone now! Thank you for your concern. - A horn! You must come with us! How do we justify the trip? - I?ll pay for the trouble. You realize what you're saying? If you die now who'll go to jail ? The things are taking lot of time. I've to leave. I've an urgent work. The Cabinet Chief is waiting for me. See you tonight at 8 at Rosati. I try to be punctual. - What shall I tell the hospital? It wont be anything serious and a check-up is always a good thing. They've found eight defects in me examining certain red spots... they neeed to examine me! What can I do if I am at the hospital! Hospital! Clinic! I've to do the... ! X-Ray for gastritis! It was't your relative who was ill? - I didn't want to stress you. Look, situation is becoming dramatic here! Not here? Can't we put little sugar? Have you read the parts? - A rehearsal. I go on the air without rehearsal, you know me enough! It's a song that I feel strongly. for. There's nothing to do... if I don't have these tests they'll quarantine me. Yes, coming at 9. Maestro, do we want to go? - You don't go down? Quick, there is no time. Pay, we must go. What did he have? - Three bitter and four coffee. Then they complain that they're nervous. - Forget it! Why did you pay? They know me. Right. Sorry, but we're in a hurry. - Where to? The station. Just 20 minutes left for the train. Yes, you know nothing! I couldn't avoid it. Tomorrow early morning, I've a meeting in Milan. In Milan? - Yes. Ah, no! what Milan? Milan no. Why would I come to Milan? That's not the case. I had to imagine that you didn't want to come. - Milan is in Milan. I've travelled the whole world to find two corresponding parts. Understood but you see, in an hour I?ll have to be on the air! Stop! - Go! No... - You take me to the station at least. No. 9 and 11 for madam. - Thank you. No, put the heavier one beneath and the smaller one above. Finally, I wont see those bad papers for eight hours. What a break! A paradise! Eight hours without a phone! All for me! How short it is! Ever had an adventure in a sleeping car? What a nice voice! I'll wait till the last moment, then I?ll go to the 1st class. Going down to inform him that your birth is vacant. Don't you agree? It would be a shame to travel so long in an empty coupe. Where are you going, Maestror? - To telepnhone! Who cares! There is not only television in life! I'm going to play in small orchestras. I'll become a singer, song writer! The program director is here, Talk to him. We're sorry for what has happened to you, but you come or you don't... we'll call master Salvetti to replace you. Call him. I wonder why haven't you called him yet. All right, we're in agreement also for the future. We are forced to deprive you of future broadcasts also. Nervous? - No, no. All right, I got free. It was easy. What a scoundrel! I hope it is your size. Try it. I really... I use just the jacket. I would try it. - Now? - Now. - Wait at least the train leaves. Now now, you've already made me wait so long for this moment! May I give you the "you" as you? - Later, later. Engineer Busardo! He has come, maybe it's better this way. I tell him two words and return. You wait, yes? Engineer Busardo, weren't we meeting tomorrow morning in Milan? I was already in train. - I prefered to come. Didn't Mr. Arduini tell you anything? I didn't go to the office and I'm lucky that I looked out! Mr. Marchetti has signed... Maestro! Don't move, we'll get lost otherwise. Maestro, look out, it's me! Giovanna, come up, we're leaving! There has been a mishap. We are not leaving. - How? Get down. The train is moving! Do you see? But how can I? I'm in my pajamas! If only you had not hurreed to undress! What am I going to do in Milan? Maestro, get down at the next, Orte! I've no money! - I'll give you something, 50, 100. How much? What you want for the return! Return by air from Florence. No, better you go to Milan so I make a commission. My money! - Where has he gone? Go to builder Rossi. Tell him lands are not being developed. Call me when you return to Rome, we'll make a nice little program! The Money!
