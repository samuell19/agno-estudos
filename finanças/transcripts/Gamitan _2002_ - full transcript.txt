What? You're shameless! You're shameless! Son of a bitch! There indeed lies the irony of love. Triumphs over... Triumphs over... love... over death. Love triumphs over... death. Please, come on. Get inside. Are you sure? Yes. This is your parents' house, right? So, what? I'm drunk. And we just finished having sex earlier. Don't worry, my parents are not here. Okay? Here comes Super B., you know. That's why, I can take charge of the situation. I told you, I'm drunk. Damn it! What do you want? Do you want me or not? So, what's your decision? Okay. If you don't want to... I'll just go to sleep. You're so shameless! Even if love triumphs over death. Even if love triumphs over death! Dianne, shut up! Even if love triumphs over death, Love would still... be the... reason... for this. Even if love triumphs over death, Love is still the reason. Good morning, sister! You guys were too loud last night. Aren't you used to me? I'm really noisy when I play. Aren't you scared of... being pregnant or getting sick? Oh, please. I'm very careful. Why do you talk like, you're the older sister here? You know, you're young. You should go out and have fun. Especially now that, Mom and Dad aren't here. Yes, I know. It's okay to have fun, even if Mom and Dad aren't here. But it doesn't mean, you'd go wild and, do whatever you want. You know, someday you'll understand me. Promise! This is what gives me life, hope, and happiness. There indeed lies the irony of love. Even if love triumphs over death, Love is still the reason. Thank you. Very good, Miss Manalo. The next person to read his piece is Louie Mendoza. Louie? Thank you, ma'am. Death. A small cup of essence. In death I tasted, delicious sourness. Look at that weirdo. Do you know what everyone's saying about him? He makes sculptures out of poop. What? Are you serious? That smells bad, right? That's his point. It smells bad. He's so disgusting. In her lap, I found genuine peace. Cathy? Cathy? Louie? Hi, Cath. You know, I really liked your poem. Really? Yes. You really beat all our poems. You know, I also liked your poem. But don't get offended, I just want to know why you always write stuff about death. I don't know. I think I'm just interested with stuff like that, about the afterlife, and lost souls. That's my favorite topic. Why? I don't know. But Cathy, aren't you curious on what will happen to you when you die? Nobody knows, that's what I always think about. Life's biggest mystery. Here. What is this? It's called an Ankh. For the Egyptians, it's a symbol for life and death. Really? Thank you. No. Keep it. Thank you. Cathy. Cathy, what's taking you so long? Let's go and eat. All right, just wait a second. Louie, I'll go ahead. Let's talk some other time. Is that okay? Goodbye. Alright. Take care. Until next time. So, what did that teacher asked you to do? Oh, my. It's poetry reading again. That pisses me off, you know. What's the use of poetry? You can't even eat it. You know why? Mrs. Selda isn't having sex with her husband. That's why she's taking it out on all of us. But, poetry reading is okay. It's actually good, we get to express... Our bottled up feelings. What's going on inside our heads. Don't you think that's okay? Whatever! You know, poetry reading, is just for weirdos, like Louie Mendoza. That's too much. Oh my God! Cathy... and Louie? No way! Stop it. But you know, he's quite handsome. Just be ready tomorrow, he might greet you with a poop statue at the quadrangle, dedicated for you. Idiot. You're such idiots. Do you know the other rumors about Louie? What? Last month, he went inside the toilet with his dog, Jograd, and a bottle of mayonnaise. And then? Wait, I'm not finished. And then, he put mayonnaise on his balls, and let the dog lick it! Gross! That's too much for me. Really, mayonnaise? Mayonnaise. Guys! It's Nick! Oh my God, did you see that? He looked at me. He was smiling at me! He was smiling at me. - Me! - Whatever. Okay, here! Defense. Pass it here! Go run there. Okay boys, I'll go ahead. Avoid staying up late, vices, and gimmicks, okay? - But with girls, keep it in moderation. - Yes, coach! Yes, coach! Okay, see you, coach! Alright! Okay! Take care! Dude, coach almost went for it. Is it okay with you? He keeps on doing that. So, Nick? Tell us what happened with Julie last night? It's okay, steady. Steady? And then? Dude. Are you keeping secrets from us? We're your friends. Yeah, and nobody's here except us. Come on, tell us. What do you want to know? I just went over to her house, and then I asked her out. After that, we ate at a restaurant! And? And then, I had sex with her, in Queen's Land Lodge. What? I knew it! I knew it! You know, dude! Teach us your style, so we can get laid! You're cool, Nicolas. Every week, you have a different girl. You know dude, I would really be surprised if I find out, you masturbate, right? I don't believe that. Because you're lucky, Nick. All the ones you jack hammer, are easy to get! In just a snap! That's true, right? Admit it. Yes, it's true, why would I make it hard for myself. It's easy to get girls. Dude, don't you want a challenge? Like devirginizing a girl. You know, that's easy for me. I'm just too lazy to do it. Fool! Just say, you can't do it! What? Let's see if you can still get innocent blood, dude! Want to bet on it? If you want, let's bet with money. Here. Let's bet on it. In a matter of one month, you should get one innocent girl. What? Two thousand pesos, all yours. Count me in! Dude, me too! But if you don't do it, the amount we bet on, you'll pay it back to us. - Of course! - Right! So? See? You're getting nervous! - You can't do it! - You're nothing! Three thousand. Three thousand? Okay, I'm in. I can buy new shoes! Dude, I'm also in. Okay, deal! Three thousand! - Call! - It's like this... August 16 is your deadline. You'd get the fresh meat by then, right? So, what? Deal? Deal! But wait. Anyone who's a virgin, and innocent, okay? No. Yes. - We have to approve of her. - Yes, right. It's our money. Yes, you have a point. Okay. So, what are you waiting for? Let's go! This one? Deal? That's too formal. Looks easy. - Dude, can you do it? - What? - Remember our money! - She's mine. Yes, that's right. How about this one, okay? No, not that one. How about this one? I think it's okay. - Not her! - She even smiled! Look at her mouth. Oh, shoot! She looked! I told you! Here, here, dude, this one's okay. The one on the right. She's alright. Oh, no! The one on the right. Not that one! - Just pick one! - The one on the left! - This one looks good. - The one on the left. - I like the one on the left! - She's mine! - That one! - Who? The one in the middle is okay. Yes, her. The one in the middle. - Is that one okay? - If you can do it. What did you say? Dude, don't underestimate Nicolas Fernandez. It's me we're talking about. That's why... You should start saving! I think it's the other way around. Hi! Shit! Were you playing? Sorry. Snake. Snake One or Snake Two? Snake Two. Oh, really? I prefer Snake One. Why? Nothing. Snake Two is more complicated. Then... You know the rat game? Rat? Yes, the Rat. The one that comes out if you eat five times. Oh yeah, it's worth 100 points. Yes. When you eat it, you get one hundred points. If you miss it, you get nothing. Yes, it annoys me sometimes. With Snake One, you know, it's really cool since, you'll know you're good, if you have a high school. But with Snake Two, you don't know, if you're good, or just got lucky. Right? I agree. By the way, I'm Nick. Cathy. Cathy is a beautiful name. Is that short for Catherine? No. Catalina. What are you doing here? Are you waiting for your ride home? I'm waiting for my friend, Lina. We live near each other, so we're sharing a taxi. I see. Where are you from? Pasig. Pasig? Oh, it's on the way to my place at Antipolo. - Antipolo? - Yes. If you want, and if it's okay with you, I'll drop you off, okay? Are you sure? Of course. If it's okay with you. If not, I'll leave you here. No, no. Please wait. Okay. Hello? Lina? Is it okay if I go ahead? It's okay, I'm going to be stuck here for a while. Why do you sound excited? Because someone offered me a ride. Who? Nick! Wow! Okay, go ahead, you lucky bitch! Ouch! That hurt my ear! Okay, bye! Yes! I can go ahead. Really? Good, okay. But, wait. I'm kind of hungry. Are you hungry? Yes! I mean, yes. - Let's eat first. - Yes, I'm hungry too. Okay, let's go. Cathy? What year are you in? What? What year are you in? Year? I'm just a freshman. B.S. Administration of Communications Technology. What? Ad Tech. Ad Tech? Is that the new course? Yes. So, what are you learning in that course? It's a mix of Management, Communications, and Administration, and Information Technology. Actually, since there's communication... Talk to me. They are joking that we'll be beeper operators. Beeper operator, because our course is a mix of Management and Communication-- Okay. I get it. Well, you know, I'm about to graduate but, until now I still don't know, what's up with Marketing. I really have no idea. I think the reason why I survived school is because I'm the star player. And of course, the school always wins because of me. I love you, will you marry me? You know what I mean? I'm popular in our school, right? Yes. Okay. You want anything? - Water? Coke? - No, thanks. Maybe, water. - Are you sure? - Yes. Okay. Sister! Sister, I'm sorry. He's my friend, Nick. Good evening. Hi. Are you classmates? What? I said, are you classmates? No, no. We're just schoolmates. I'm a senior already. - I'll go ahead. - Are you sure? I still have a practice tomorrow. Okay. Thanks, Nick. Thanks also. Nice meeting you. All right. Take care. I'll go ahead. I'm leaving. Okay. Thanks. - Bye. - Bye. Who's that? Oh, my God! You know, sister, he's the heartthrob at school! He gave me a ride home. He talked to me. Then, avoid him. Why should I? Didn't you see it? The way he looked at me, he's like a pervert. You know, I think, he's not nice. Since he knows he's handsome. For sure, he can do whatever he wants with you. Dianne? Dianne, you're too much. You just met him! Listen to me, forget about him. You know sister, you have a big problem. This is the first time I brought the guy I like, and you're going to give me a hard time? As if you know how to choose a guy. Cathy, every time I choose a guy, I know what I'm getting into. I'm not like you. You don't know a thing about men. You know, Dianne? What if you prioritize fixing your life before you meddle with other people's lives? Okay, goodbye. What ''goodbye''? It's up to you. Is it true that Nick gave her a ride home? Well, we know her, she won't lie to us. She might be insecure, so she's making up stories. Hey, what are you talking about? Nothing. So how are you? Still in cloud Nine. I heard, so how's the ride? Well actually, the ride was okay, but the date was better. - Date? - Date? Date! Well actually, it wasn't a date. We just had dinner at Takayami. That's all. As in, just the two of you? No one's with us. You fool, I don't believe you. You're exaggerating. The first part is realistic. Then don't believe me, it's up to you. Hi, Cathy. Nick! How are you? I'm good. I enjoyed last night. Cathy, are you doing something later? Later? I need to study for an English test tomorrow. Is that so? I wanted to ask you if we can watch a movie. It's okay, maybe next time. Okay. I'll go with you. Actually, you know, English, it's easy for me. I'm an expert with that. So what? Do you still want to watch a movie? Sure! See you at the bench, around five? Sure. - Alright. - See you. I'll see you there. Bye. So girls, how's that? I'll miss our group study later, I have a date. Get out of here, you witch. Sorry, I'm late. It's okay. Wow! You look amazing in your dress, you look so fine. Thank you. Did you order already? No, not yet. So, what do you want? Is it true? What? Are you two together already? Nick and I? Yes! Is it true? When he kissed me, does it mean we're together? Oh, my God! Miss Mallare, will you please keep quiet! Sorry, ma'am. - Yes, you're so together! - We are! Son of a bitch, aren't you going to stop? Ma'am? What are you doing? Hi, Cathy. Hi. You know Cathy, everyone's talking about you. Is the news true? About Nick and I? Yes. What's up with you? You're all rumor mongers. You beat Boy Abunda. Not really. We're just concerned. Concerned? Why are you concerned? I'm not sick. Hi, Cathy. Nick. Do you have anything to do? I have a class at 4:30. I'm going to the library now. I see. I was planning to ask you out. Nick, so what can we do in two hours? Nothing! Just come with me. We'll drive around. I just had it upgraded, and it's nice. Okay, alright. Louie, we'll go ahead. Bye, take care. Take care. Who's that douche? It's Louie. Our weird classmate. Don't mind him. Your car is awesome. Like the ones they blow up in films. I thought you had it upgraded? No. I just said that because, I just wanted to be with you. Really? Why? Wait. What are we? What do you mean? What we really are. Who you are to me? Are you my boyfriend? Flirting? What? Your classmates are talking about us. About the both of us. You know what Cathy, when you reach my age, labels no longer matter. The important thing is, I love you and you love me, too. That's enough. So, you love me? Yes. Of course. Cathy, are you okay? Yes. You know that, I really love you, right? You know, our relationship has reached this far. Do you want to make it deeper? Let's take it one level further. What do you mean? I mean, physical level. As in, sex? Making love. I'm not yet ready. It's important for me to give my virginity the right way and to the right person. Really? So... That means, I'm not the right guy? It's not like that, but-- No. You don't love me, is that it? Nick. You know Cathy, it's all a waste. I thought you love me, like how I love you. I even thought about marrying you! Nick, I feel the same way, but do you know that feeling? If we end up together-- What feeling? Okay, I get it. I get it. It's like you want to tell me that you're not sure about us? It's like you're saying, I'm just another guy for you. Nick, I'm not saying that. So, what am I to you? Nick, you're the one I love. Son of a bitch, what love? Bullshit. Wait. Why don't you get out? This is my car! Hi Cathy, Mom called earlier. She asked if you wanted her to bring home a souvenir. Hello, are you okay? He hasn't called me for days. Who? Nick. Son of a bitch, forget about him. The first time I saw him, I knew he's a bad influence. But sis, I love him. But sis, I love him. You know what, it's only in your head. There are a lot of guys who will come around. Look at me, I've had 13 boyfriends. Sis, that's gross. Sorry. But... You know, you have to listen to me. Because in this family, I know I'm the mistake. I feel... I feel hopeless. But you... You're pretty, smart, and kind. I don't want you to end up like me. Okay? Okay. Come on, eat. Nick, what day is it now? August 14, dude. 14? Yes, August 14. You have two days left. And Nick, I heard that, you're quarreling with Cathy. Oh, my. It looks like... I'm about to buy myself DVDs from Video City. Ready your cash, bro. Really? Are you doubting me? I'll tell you this... When it comes to basketball, you're just second rate. Keep this in mind, when it comes to girls, you're still second rate to me. You know, you talk too much. You're all talk. Only two days left, Nick. You're running out of time. Is that so? Are you not worried? Are you not worried? Why should I worry? I don't know. I don't know. Dude, just trust me. Cathy? Nick, I waited for three days. You didn't even call me. And Nick, why are you avoiding me? Baby, I'm sorry. I thought you still needed time to prove if you really love me. You know, I really missed you. But I can't bring myself to call you, since I might piss you off. Nick, no. I really love you. Nick, I know that I want to be with you and for the rest of my life. Nick, I'm sorry. Forgive me, please. Baby, I'm sorry, too. I'll never argue with you again. Promise. Nick, I'm sorry. I love you. Let's go. I'll drive you home. Son of a bitch. Son of a bitch! Please take care of me. Don't worry, I'll take care of you. Nick, if anyone asks, do I tell them that you're my boyfriend? There you go again. It's not important. Wait, why are you so obsessed with being my girlfriend? Nothing. I just thought about it. And decided that, it's important to be official. So... people would know that, we're committed to each other. You know, commitment is not important. As long as, you love me, and I love you, it's enough. Was it okay, dude? Nick, how are you? Hey, Nick. Dude. Dude, this one's for you. Dude, you look sad. Don't tell me, after everything, nothing happened. That's right, dude. I know, I know. Smell this. Man, smell it. See? Son of a bitch, dude, you did it! Two days left and you did it! You had two days left! You're all stubborn! Who are you talking to? Nick, right? Right? There's nothing we can do about that. Before anything else, give me my money. I did my part of the bargain, so give it to me. You're the man, dude! It's Nicolas Fernandez! Now, give it to me. Dude, thank you very much! You guys are so nice! Dude, wait. I'll just get the money. Dude, give that to me, okay? I'm a man of my word. Dude, this is complete. But before that, you have to tell us what happened. I agree, dude. Listen to me. It felt so good. She's so tight! It's amazing! Freshly squeezed, but no preservatives. She's not that good though. I have no problems with that. I can always go back to experienced women. There you go! The easy girls, who are good in bed. So, are you breaking up with Cathy? Yes. Just like that, dude? Just like that. Poor girl. Yes, poor girl. Hi, sister! Good morning. Good morning! Good morning! Wow, this sausage smells good. Come on, let's eat. Get away, devil! What did you do to my sister? Sister, are you okay? Nick and I made up last night. It's not only that. That smile is different. - What? - I know that. Sister, what are you thinking about right now? It's nothing. - No... - What? Something happened last night, right? Nothing happened. Then why am I sensing something else? What? What are you talking about? Maybe... You were on top? Sister, what are you talking about? No, I didn't. I told you to be careful. My God. It's because he's handsome. I bet you didn't even reach the climax. Dianne! You're-- You know... You're puzzling me! You're so vague! - I quit, I'll go out. - There! - I'm going. - There! See, that's what I'm saying. See, that's what I'm saying. You know, handsome guys like him, have small dicks! You should have asked him, to wear a condom. How do we tell this to Cathy? I don't know. What I know is they've made up last night. Hi! Wow, you seem so happy. Nick apologized last night, so we're okay. That's what you think. - What? - What? Nothing. Cathy, it's better if we go to the library. Library? What are we going to do at the library? You know... Nick? Houston, we have a problem. Enemy has been spotted. The eagle has landed. We're ready for lift off. You're weird, Val. Hi, Nick. Babe, is there a problem? Why won't you kiss me? Nick, I'm sorry, but... Is she your girlfriend? No. Cathy? Are you my bodyguard? I said, are you my bodyguard? No. So, why are you stalking me then? Nick? Nick, what's happening to you? Cathy, it's over between us. Is that hard to understand? Nick, I thought you love me? That was before, Cathy Nick-- Is it hard to understand that it's over between us? But, Nick? It was just yesterday. It was just yesterday! Anything I'll say won't make any sense to you now. Let's go. I'm sorry. That was my ex. She's not over me yet. It's okay. That asshole better watch his back. You know what Cathy, seriously, it is okay. You don't deserve him. And just look at that slut. Looks like he just picked her somewhere. - How much are you? 100? 200? - 50! Nicolas? Nicolas! Guard him! Nicolas! Nicolas! Nick. Nick. Cathy, what? Nick. Nick, I want to know why you did this to me. Nick, have I done something? Did I do something wrong last night? Nick, why? I don't understand. Nothing. I did some thinking last night. Then I realized that, you're not for me. That's all. - That's all. - Why? Nick, why? That's how it is. I'm sorry. Nick, you told me you love me. You told me you love me, right? Why are you doing this to me? Nick, why? Cathy, I loved you. But I think, we're better off as friends. Don't you think so? Friends? Friends? Cathy, that's how it is. You told me, labels are not important. As long as we love each other. You told me it's not important. But you're not my girlfriend. I don't have any obligation to you. Nick please, hear me out. You know, dude. It's all our fault. Hello? Hello, Nick? This is Cathy. Nick, I love you. Sorry. I'm really sorry, baby. Nick? Nick! Son of bitch! What have you done to me? Nick! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! Cathy! That's enough! Stop it! That's enough! Stop! That's enough! That's enough! That's enough! That's enough. Nick! Cathy. - That's enough. - Sister... Sister... Makeover, that's what you need. With the 13 boyfriends that I had, only five of them were serious. I did everything, drugs, liquor, suicide. But you know what's effective? Makeover! Because with a makeover, it's as if you're a new person with a new life. And after a while, that's it! Hey, are you listening? No, another one, another one. - Let's do it together. -Okay, okay. One, like this. Smile. Wow, you're good. You learn fast. The student is now the master. So, what are you thinking now? You know what, sis? I think something's missing. There's one more thing you haven't taught me. What? How to seduce a guy. Seduction. Sedu-- Seduction? Are you kidding me? No. Seduction is not a joke. What I just taught you, how to do a makeover, that's nothing. If you want to seduce a guy, you should change everything. Your character, the way you think, your whole life. You should take out all the kindness, all the sympathy in your heart. And you have to promise me, whoever you're going to seduce, must know how to play the game, and is not innocent. Promise? Promise. Hi, Louie. Hi, Cathy. You look different now. Did you notice something? You're wearing the Ankh! It suits me, right? Yes, it does. Louie, you know, I'm having trouble with Math. Can you teach me? But I'm not good with Math. How about Judylou? No. The person I want is you. Okay, where? At my house. Is that okay? Sure, sure. So, you carry this over to the other side. And then, get the square root of both sides of the equation. So that's how you do it. Now, I understand it. Yes, it's confusing at first, but you'd get used to it eventually. Louie, that's enough. Let's have some snacks. Is this okay? Yes, that's okay. Thanks. Let's proceed to the next chapter. Matrices. Matrices? You know, my head will just hurt. But we have homework, Cathy. I don't want you to fail. What if you do that, and then I'll copy from you. You'll only get annoyed with me, since I don't really understand it. Can you do it, please? Alright, alright. Wow, you're so sweet. Because of that, I'll give you a kiss. What? Ready? Okay. That's for you, because you're nice. You know Louie, there's a lot coming, but for other favors, okay? Okay, let's move on to the other problems. Okay. Okay, Cathy. This one's easy. So... okay... Cathy? Cathy! Louie, let's play Word Association. What's that? I will tell you a word. Tell me the first thing that comes to your mind. Okay. Tires. Car. Beeper. It dies. Mayonnaise. Spam. Dog. Rowdy. Balls? Nothing. Cathy, sometimes I can't understand you. I'm just joking around! I'm just testing you! Oh, my God! Why? Why? That book! What about it? I've been looking for that for a long time. I've been to several bookstores, but I couldn't find that book. Then let's buy it. Why? I don't have money. I have money. I'll buy it for you. No. Why? I don't understand why not. I want you to steal it. What? No, I won't do it. Louie, please. Catalina Manalo, I can do a lot for a friend, but stealing something, is not part of the list. Then don't do it for a friend. What am I to you, Cathy? Your slave? Who will do anything you say to make you happy? Yes. Okay. Good morning, ma'am. Hey, what do you have there? What are you looking at? Are you looking at my boobs? You know, I saw you! You're looking at my boobs. I don't understand why they hired a pervert here! I bet you hit on all your customers. Where is your manager? Where isyour manager? Tell me where your manager is, now! Louie, are you going to let him do that to me? Cathy, let's go. You know what? You should be thankful your manager is not here, or else, I will make sure you get fired! Louie, let's go! Wait a minute. We exchanged favors here. You stole a book for me, I made out with you. You'll get your chance to touch me someday. Wait, what's up with all these favors anyway? Nothing. I'm just playing. Are you playing with me? Playing is different from playing along. Why? You want to quit? No, I just want to know who I am to you? For me, you're a decent guy, who's misunderstood by others. Okay. If you say so. Sister, how was your day? I'm happy. Look, I have a new book. This looks nice. Did you go shopping a while ago? Something like that. Who were you with? No one, just a friend. Louie. So, you have a new boy. Please don't use Louie, to get over Nick. I did that before, nothing happened. Louie would be pitiful. Sister, I won't do that, and Louie is different. He's nice. And what about Nick? He'll regret what he did. Cathy, I warned you about Nick, right? You know, you'll just get hurt. I know, he was your first. But... It's more painful, if you're obsessed with him. Why? Do I look obsessed? ''Why? Do I look obsessed?'' Where are we? Where are you taking me? Just go along. You might rape me. I might. This place looks nice. This is my new painting. What do you think? It's nice. So... I feel you live alone? My family is in Cebu, I came here to study. My parents are well-off. That's why rent is not a problem, for this kind of apartment. Don't you want to be in a dorm instead? It's too noisy. I can't concentrate. At least here, I can do anything. Writing, painting, thinking. You're right. Come on, let's take a picture. What? Are you okay? Is there something wrong? It's nothing. Hey. I can see it in your eyes. What's your problem? I'll help you. I'm really pissed. That son of a bitch Costelo, gave me an "F" in Math. "F"? That sucks. Yes! It sucks a lot. So, can you still help me? Well, for you to pass, I don't know. But if you want revenge, I can do something about that. Really? How? Well, we know that Mister Costelo loves... His car. Right. His Toyota Corolla. Let's say, he got a flat tire in the middle of the campus. Go on Louie, go on, I like it. Since someone slashed his tires. Bad boy. Not only will his car be pitiful, but he'd be humiliated in front of the whole student body. But... Who will slash his tire? Who else? Yours truly, Louie Mendoza. Is that your final answer? Yes. Good. Now, it's time for your advanced bonus. Wow, Cathy. You know what? Everyone's impressed with your makeover. You got something good from Nick after all. Really? But you know, that's not the only reason-- Guys, guys! Guys, guys! Guess what? Do you really change your hairdo everyday? Why not? Anyway, do you know what happened to Mister Costelo's car? Someone slashed his tires. He was fuming mad! He was cursing everyone at the campus! Really? That's it. Okay. Cathy! Cathy! Hi, Louie! Have you heard the news? Awesome, right? Okay. So, what was that? Oh, my God! Oh, my God. Why? It's Louie who slashed Mister Costelo's tires. Then that's good. No, you don't understand. It's like this. He told me that he has a crush on me. But I don't like him. Then I told him that, Mister Costelo failed me in Math. You know, guys. Maybe Louie did that to impress me. That's scary. You know, Cath, be careful around that psycho, okay? He's not just a weirdo, but a stalker as well. Don't take that off yet. Do you want to have sex with me? Yes. Are you ready? Are you turned on? But before that, you have to do one more thing. Just one more. Fuck! What? Nick. Nick? You have to beat him up. Cathy! That's different! I can't do that for you. Damn it! Cathy, even if I can beat him up, I can't do that. I don't want to hurt anyone. But how about me, Louie? How about me? You don't know, and he doesn't know, how much pain he caused me. Did he ever think about me? He never thought of me, because he didn't care. Nick hurt me, Louie. He hurt me. That's why he should pay. Do you know... Do you know how hard, it is to forget what he did to me? That was so painful. He used me. He used me like some worthless rag, which he threw away after. For no reason. Because he wanted to! Because he just wanted to! That son of a bitch! What? Cathy, calm down. Cathy, take it easy. Cathy. This is the last one. This is the last. Really? Promise. Okay. Okay. Thank you, Louie. I love you. Wow! You look gorgeous! Thank you. You know, I just remembered the other day. You remembered what? That Louie guy. Don't let him go. Sister, why did you suddenly mention him? Nothing. Because Cathy, I don't want you to be like me. You'd think that my life is happy. Because I do whatever I want. But in reality, I'm still searching for my true love. There are a lot of guys like Nick, Cathy. But the ones like Louie, they're different. They're hard to find. You're lucky. On your second time, you've hit the jackpot. Cathy? Hi. Hi, Nick. How are you? Well, horny. What? You? At last, I think I'm graduating! Oh, really? That's great. You know, Nick, sex is fun after all. Ever since, you devirginized me... I can hardly forget it. Actually, I'm in heat right now. What do you mean? Fuck me. Are you scared of me, Nick? Of course not. Why would I be? Don't be afraid. I know I overreacted with what you did to me. That's only normal, right? Because you're my first. Okay. But I'm over you. Good. That's only my feelings. But with being horny? No. Cathy, enough already. You know, Nick, I have an idea. What if we have a relationship? We talked about that already. But not boyfriend-girlfriend. That's not important for guys your age, right? What I mean is, use me for sex, if you agree, and I'll use you in return. Sounds good. Tastes even better. Do you have something else to do? None. Nice. Who owns this place? My friend's apartment. He's not here so, he let me use it. It's better than paying a motel, right? Let's go. Your friend's place is alright. Weird, right? Wow, so serious? Fuck me. Son of a bitch! Son of a bitch! You're an animal! God damn it, Louie! Cathy, we killed him. You killed him. We're dead. You killed him. Cathy, I know. Louie, you killed him. Damn it, Cathy! I know! Damn it, Cathy! I know! Louie. You killed him. Oh, my God. Are you sure it's your first time? I thought you were tired with the exercise. I almost forgot. We still have to fix something. What? Let's turn him over to the police, Cathy. They will believe that it's self-defense. Are you an idiot? We would be judged by people. Reporters will run after us. We will get humiliated. So what do we do now? With the kitchen knife, we can cut through the bones instantly! This makes body disposal fast, easy, and fun. Don't you have hands? Anyway, this is the duct tape and trash bag. That stinks. Don't you have a mop here? No, I don't have any. A rag? There, on the side. Bleach? At the cabinet. Okay, thanks! Do you have the car key? Yes. Let's go. Have you seen Anjo? Granny, you scared me. Have you seen Anjo? Anjo? It's my dog, a shih tzu. Have you seen him? I haven't seen him. I'm sorry. He's a nice dog. Granny, we'll go ahead, because we have something to do. Dear? Yes, Granny? Take care. They will know your secret. Just be ready when that day comes. Okay, fine. Louie, let's go. So, where do we dispose this? Let's just toss this car. Where? Think. That's why you have a brain, right? We're here. I thought you don't smoke. No, I don't. How about you, Nick? Are you okay back there? You might be getting dizzy, just tell me. So, what? Is this okay? That's alright. I don't think anyone will see it. What are you waiting for? Let's go. How do we go home? How else? We'll take a taxi. There's no taxi here at this time. Oh, damn. Love is a cold flame. And death. That can never be ruined, or put to rest. A small cup of essence. This is where my soul is from. In death, I tasted. This is what gives me life, hope, and happiness. The bittersweet taste. Her open hands, her sweet notions. There is indeed an irony in love. Her smile. In her embrace I felt. Even if love triumphs over death. The happiness, Only in her lap, I have found. Love will still be the reason for this. The true peace. Students, I have sad news today. Last night, one of your schoolmates, Nicholas Fernandez, was found dead. Nick? I won't say the details. But apparently, he was brutally murdered and his body is unfit for display. So from today until October 18, there will be a service held for him at the memorial homes. And for whoever wants to go... Guys, I heard Nick's body was mutilated. That's sick. Who would do such a thing? Cathy, are you okay? I know this is hard for you. You know guys, I think I know who killed Nick. How can you say that? Didn't I tell you about Louie courting me before? Yes, and so? The other day, I told him that I'm still in love with Nick. Then he told me that, he will kill Nick. Guys, I'm scared. What if he really did it? Is it him? You have a point, Louie's been absent for a week now. Cathy, if he ever tells you about it, report it right away. We can call the cops. What if something happens to you? Alright. Thank you. Cathy. Every time I look at the floor, I remembered what happened. My hands dripping with blood. I can still feel... His grip on my neck. I can still hear... the sound... when his head cracked. And his face. And why? Do you think it's easy for me? It's hard for me, too! I think about it all the time! What happened has happened. But, we have to move on with our lives. By the way, they found Nick's body yesterday. Really? Yes. If I were you, I won't sulk here anymore. Because it won't be long until, the cops become suspicious of you. Louie, if I were you, come to class tomorrow. I don't want to, Cathy. It's been a week, since I last slept. I'll confess to the police. What? No! Don't do that! Cathy, I really can't forget what we did. What you did! We did it! I can't even think straight nor do anything! I can't even go anywhere without me looking around! It's like I'm being followed by Nick's ghost! I'd rather choose to be punished by them. With that, I can pay for all my sins. What for? It would be good if you were the only one involved! But how about me? How about me? I'd like to go out! Watch TV! And study! I want to do all the things I want to do! But Louie, think. How will I do that, if I will be in jail? Then let's get out of here. Let's go to Cebu. At least there, my parents can take care of us. Let's get married there, Cathy. Get married? Get married, Louie? Hello? Are you okay? You know Louie, sometimes you're really out of your mind. If you want to go there. Go there by yourself and hide! You're not coming with me? What for? I like it more here in Manila. But I thought you love me. Well, well. Congratulations, Louie. Many people die with false assumptions. You know? Do what you want. I don't care about you anymore! But you have to remember this. Whatever you do, never tell the cops. And you know, we shouldn't see each other anymore. Never! Are you leaving me? You're smart. Good thing you are using your head now. Goodbye. Just remember this Louie, I'm just a victim here, you are the real murderer. You bitch! You shameless bitch! You're so shameless! You bitch! I did this for you! I did this for you! I did it, because I love you! You son of a bitch! Catalina Manalo arrived dead at San Lorenzo Hospital. According to the authorities, she was murdered by Louie Mendoza. The same guy who brought her to the hospital. They also believe that he killed Nick Fernandez, who was recently found dead, and his mutilated body in the car. TV Balita interviewed people who knew the victim. Cathy knew Louie killed Nick since he was jealous of him. We told her to say something so we can call the police. But it was too late. Nick and Cathy are victims of Louie's madness. I thought he was a good guy. If I didn't give her that advice, my sister would still be alive.
