[♪♪] MAN: Four billion years ago, the first marine life formed. First came the fish. Then, slowly, other life forms evolved. Therefore, our ancestors came from fish. Everyone, come and see this. Tyrannosaurus from the Cretaceous period. Ferocious! [SOUND OF T. REX ROARING] [MAKES ROARING SOUND] WOMAN: Red. Pong! Isn't that a gecko? How else could I get a 15-ton T. rex in here? I shrank it down using our advanced technology. There's also the Panthera tigris. [WHIMPERING] That's a dog! Lucky is a genuine Panthera tigris balica. You call it "Lucky"? "Lucky" is a dog's name! "Lucky"? When did I say "Lucky"? "LUCKY" Hurry, your turn! So, what if it's called "Lucky"? It's still a Panthera tigris balica! Hey, you're expecting a lot for only 10 bucks. [LAUGHING] Nature is truly wonderful. In order to adapt, creatures from land, sea and sky breed with each other. And humans are no exception. For example, the scientific name of a man who can fly is "Batman." In Chinese, it's "Batman." In English, still "Batman." Miss, why are you eating Batman's ear? I thought they were chicken wings. You may not respect Batman, but respect yourself! Put the chicken wing back! Not the chicken wing. I mean Batman's ear. Anything else to see? Yes, of course, silly. I've got a mermaid back here. How did you guess that? Wow, you really have your wits about you! Isn't this salted fish? Specimens are always preserved with salt! You're a smart girl. The exhibition's over. Goodbye! I don't believe you! You're lying! Refund! Right, refund! ALL [CHANTING]: Refund! Refund! Refund! Enough! I've worked damn hard to run this place! You idiots want to ruin me? It ain't happening! Open the door! Let them see it! Are you sure? Open it! [WATER BUBBLING] [♪♪] I'm a mermaid. My heart! Help! Okay, is that really necessary? Hey, I'm just trying to make a living, okay? Don't worry, be happy! Let's take a picture. Damn you! Get him! Let's get him! MALE AUCTIONEER: 10 billion! 10.05 billion! 20 billion! 20 billion, once! 20 billion, twice! 20.01 billion! 20.02 billion! 20.03 billion, 20.04 billion, 20.05, 20.06 billion! Please, be calm. 20.07 billion! 20.08 billion! 20.08 billion, once! 20.08 billion, twice! Come on! 20.08 billion! Sold! FEMALE REPORTER: Mr. Liu, why pay 300 percent more than this land is worth? Our group wants to develop Green Gulf into an ecologically friendly project. Such an endeavor cannot be measured in money. Thank you! [♪♪] [TIRES SCREECH] Uncle Rich. Liu. Ruo-lan. Cheng, you're on time today! You bought Green Gulf and opened a bottle of '90 Romanée-Conti. I had to be on time for once! I'm really sorry. When it's this good, I have to act fast! Look at this land in Green Gulf. Spectacular! So beautiful! Let's celebrate! Are you sure about Green Gulf? You don't know anything about real estate! Have you worked out the numbers? No. But Uncle Rich and Ruo-lan did. No matter how much they bid, I outbid them, and always just by one. The amount of the bid was small! Not even enough to build a toilet! What did the legendary Bruce Lee teach us? "Be like water, my friend. Just go with the flow." ♪ Being invincible is lonely ♪ ♪ So lonely ♪ ♪ Being invincible is empty ♪ ♪ So empty ♪ Stop that awful song! If Ruo-lan acquired Green Gulf, it would have been a failure. Acquiring Green Gulf in addition to her surrounding property would have allowed her to raise land prices and boost property sales. You're an idiot! You bought a piece of crap! There's nothing there! You've got some nerve, talking about Bruce Lee! What were you thinking, you idiot! Mr. Liu is offering us his Romanée-Conti. Be nice, or he'll change his mind. Ruo-lan... you're adding insult to injury! I estimate that Liu's project will lose 20 billion while raising our market value. Without even trying, we'll be earning 30 billion. And now we're drinking his million-dollar wine. Aren't we greedy savages? Your self-immolation will illuminate us! You... are a great man! You're my idol! You're far too generous! I could never repay you in my lifetime, or even in the next one. [MAN LAUGHING] Brutal! If Green Gulf could be reclaimed, the profits would be huge! Reclamation? Green Gulf is a conservation area with plenty of dolphins. Otherwise, why would I have sold you that piece-of-crap land right next to it? You really think I would do this for you? I heard that the dolphins are moving away. What are you talking about? What's this? Reclamation permit. Is this for real? Of course. That's it. I'm leaving! Cheng... I thought we were okay. What are you doing with the pesticide? "Pesticide"? You idiot! This is our newly acquired high-tech jetpack. Take it off. You haven't even had a drink yet! I'm not taking it off! Why don't you make me? You son of a bitch! Goddamn you! [GRUNTS] Be careful of the wall behind you! Turn! You can do it! Oh, crap, it's broken! Cheng can be such a jackass. Can't people talk reasonably? Why throw a tantrum? You're smart. You're a great man! Open the door and let him fly out! Green Gulf is a profitable project. How about doing it together? It would be my honor, Uncle Rich! That's great! Now that I'm retired, you can work with Ruo-lan. Deal? We have a big party today. Let's have fun! [LATIN MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] [CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICK] Hello. Hi. [CHATTERING AND LAUGHING] Whoever finds this watch first, it's yours. You're so weird. Are you trying to humiliate us? How much can her watch be worth? Not much. Just 8 million. [LAUGHS] Miss Ruo-lan, you just threw 8 million into the water. Eight million to open your eyes is well worth it. Now you can see their true colors. [WOMEN SCREAMING] Very clearly! They're young, working hard for their money. I highly respect that! Aren't we all the same? You came from nothing. It takes great ability to achieve what you have. You even managed to get the reclamation permit. Those second-generation rich brats don't compare to you. Cut the crap, let's work together. How do you wanna do it? You have a promising project, I have the most prestigious realty firm. What do you think we should do? Join forces, raise the stock price... and make a killing. Of course! Thirty billion should buy me 50 percent. Forty percent. Aren't you worried about upsetting me? No. Happy now? At least 45 percent. Deal. WOMAN: Mr. Liu! Mr. Liu, I-- What the hell are you guys doing? How did she get in here? Stop! What are you doing? Don't go over there! People like that have diseases! It's fine. I'll just take a look. Go ahead. I'm leaving! Wait. Hey. Boss, this person is not on our list of dancers. Who are you? Mr. Liu, my name is Shan. Sorry, I snuck in. You're so handsome! Of course! Take her away. Let's go. No! Wait! This is my number. Please call me, okay? I'm begging you. Okay. Thank you so much! When will you call me? You must call me! Thank you! I'm so grateful! You're so handsome! So pathetic! [♪♪] ALL NATURAL Smells good! Come, try it. Thank you. Some fish food and a bottle of anti-inflammatory solution. Okay, thank you! [♪♪] [TIRES SCREECH] [TRADITIONAL EASTERN INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING] [BUBBLING] MAN: Shan. How is our plan going? I gave my number to Liu Xuan. He promised to call me. MAN: That's great! That bastard Liu Xuan destroyed Green Gulf! He destroyed our home and killed so many of us! Finally, we can take revenge! With Haichang Holdings, we opened an aquarium in Dalian Tiger Beach. The polar theme park in Shanghai Dishui Lake will be completed in 2017. Its scale will be comparable to Disneyland. The PR department is promoting the conservation of marine animals. All right. Haichang is the leading pioneer in this industry. Let's leave it to them to protect the Earth. I'm shallow. I'm only interested in money. Let's talk about the Green Gulf project. We've placed sonar transmitters in Green Gulf. They've been producing effective results. No dolphins have been found within a 50-mile radius. So there are no problems with the reclamation work. What guarantees are there that the dolphins won't be back? These sonar transmitters are different from the earlier ones. They're more powerful and destructive. We can also adjust the frequencies to target different species. This is a simulation of what the dolphins experience from the sonar transmitters. Here's a cute goldfish. Switch on. [GASPS] Oh, my God! That's too cruel! Game over! I'm dizzy. Take a photo for me. [PHONE CAMERA BEEPS] [LAUGHS] The dolphins won't be back for sure. Anyone brave enough to try it? In fact, the sonar can also help us explore the ocean. The research shows that one of the frequencies is not from dolphins. [DISTORTED ANIMAL SOUNDS PLAYING] [♪♪] In ancient times, both humans and our ancestors were apes. When the land changed, some apes were forced to live in the sea. Their legs were of no use and evolved into fishtails. Mermaids and humans should have coexisted side-by-side. But ever since ancient times whenever humans spotted us, they hunted us down. Since then, we have stayed away from humans. However, the more advanced they get, the more violent they've become. [BOMB HOWLING DURING DESCENT] So humans are evil. But... But what? [SNORING] Shitai fell asleep again. But she's right. All humans are evil! Chemical waste, bombs, everything. It's already very hard for us to avoid those things. But now with the sonar transmitters all over the ocean, there's no way to escape! Now we're stuck in Green Gulf. There's no way out, not by land nor sea! We have to kill Liu Xuan. He's responsible! That's our only hope to return to the ocean. Everyone knows Liu Xuan is a pervert. Look at the news. It's everywhere. So we sent our beauty, Shan, with a modified tail. She's gone through intense training, sneaking into the human world and getting our daily supplies. She's very experienced. See how devoted she is to her dancing! She's fearless. I think she dances better than McDonald. WOMAN: It's "Madonna," okay? MAN: I say "McDonald." So what? Here's our plan: a honey trap. First, we send our beauty to seduce the target. Then we send our assassins to kill him. Simple as that! There's foam coming out of your mouth! Because of this poisonous arrow. Alcohol can remove this poison, but not my hatred. Kill Liu Xuan! ALL: Kill Liu Xuan! But the one I hate the most is not Liu Xuan. It's you, bitch! Why did you shoot me? Liu Xuan is the target, not me! [LAUGHS] It was an accident. What? That definitely was no accident! Hey, I had to test it, right? To make sure it worked. Right? You're fired! Dismissed! Shan, come here. You always bring back roast chicken. You're the only one who likes it. What about the others? I'm sorry. Liu Xuan is a typical pervert. If you try to seduce him, he will kiss you. Do you have any experience? No. I think it's my duty to practice with you. Okay. Did you feel anything? No. Impossible! Nothing at all. You must have felt something. Don't be shy. Don't hold back your feelings. Release your emotions and feel it. Okay? There's nothing, you fool! That's a relief. What's next? Wait for the call! The frequency is very strange, possibly from a species unknown on Earth. Aliens? Aliens? ET? Whatever. Just give me the report in three days. Why do you always have to one-up me? I'd like to be the one up on you. [BOTH GIGGLING] Mr. Chairman has something urgent to take care of. Please leave immediately! You're bad! Don't. Still no call yet. Is there something wrong with our plan? The honey trap depends on the honey. Shan is pretty. Shouldn't be any problems. No, no. I'm just an ordinary girl. Not ordinary at all. Her eyes are especially small. And her nose is huge. With very sharp teeth, like a hound. Very flat-chested. Like they were run over by a steamroller. [LAUGHING] Thank you. Good. Yes, very good. [LAUGHING] You're crazy. As are you. We're two of a kind. No, we're not the same. We have different traits. Different in what way? The difference between a nobleman and a lowlife. Much like how a pauper can dress up as a prince, but inside, he's still a pauper! The prostitute from the party last night cost just 200 bucks, yet you still wanted her. Your every action shows your lowlife traits. [RINGING] Hello. LIU: This is Liu Xuan. Where are you? Home. Where's that? Guillotine Cliff, Grindstone Mountain, Green Gulf. I'll pick you up in 10 minutes. Okay. What is it? Liu Xuan said he'll pick me up in 10 minutes. [ALL CHEERING] My lowlife traits are like cancer in my bones. The doctor said it's terminal. It can't be cured. What do you mean? [♪♪] Kill Liu Xuan! Kill Liu Xuan! [SCREAMING] Miss, Mr. Liu sent us to pick you up. Shan. Who are you? I'm her uncle. Yes, he's my uncle. You forgot your bag. Don't waste this chance. Have fun. What's this? It's an octopus I caught. It escaped earlier. Don't touch it! It's ferocious! I'll kill it now! Let me help you. No! There's bacteria on your knife. Put it down. Be a good boy. It's all right. Well done. Uncle loves you. What are you doing? Stop pulling! I need it as a whole big piece for BBQ. Let me help you. What's up with you again? Where do all these weapons come from? Mostly from the Internet. Okay, fine! Let me think again. No BBQ. Sashimi would be better. Mister, let go, let go. I'll count to three. One, two, three. Stop biting. Stop biting! I told you to stop biting! Sorry, I've never seen such a big octopus. I got excited! You're young. You're supposed to get excited. The next time you're excited, focus your energy on girls rather than an innocent octopus, you sick bastard. Right. Sorry, Uncle. WOMAN: The boss will be here soon. Miss, we have to do a security check. Stand up. [SENSOR BEEPS] What's inside your shoes? Nothing! Please take them off. No, it's very difficult to take them off! Don't worry. Just put your feet on the table, and we'll take them off for you. Please. Hold on! [SENSOR BEEPS] Oh. That's why. It's fine now. I'm sorry. What's this? Sea urchin. And this? Sea urchin opener. What for? To eat it! You always carry sea urchins to eat? Is it illegal? Not illegal! [BOTH CHUCKLE] You scared me to death. You were being sneaky with these glasses of water. Did you poison them? I'm just kidding! You really scared me to death this time. That's what I was trying to do. You scared the crap out of me! [BOTH LAUGHING] Let's have a drink. Which one is mine? Don't worry. No one touched them yet. Cheers! Any problem? [LAUGHS] No problem. This lemon is so sour! I thought you were poisoned-- What? I thought you were poisoned-- MAN: Mr. Liao! Mr. Liao! Stop it! What are you doing? He'll be fine if he drinks some alcohol. Mr. Liao, are you okay? What happened? You fainted. Have some water, Mr. Liao. [ALL CLAMORING] Mr. Liao, are you okay? Just get lost! I'm going to kill you! You're lucky I'm vegetarian, or you would be dead meat! Don't push me! Boss. Go to hell! [♪♪] [SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY] Okay, I'll call you back. All right? Damn you! Can't even handle one simple task! Stop standing there like dogs! Idiots! Get it done! Now! Hey, you. Nothing. Don't worry about it. What's up? Go on. [LAUGHING] Okay. Mr. Liu, the door is fixed.

It's very tasty. Are you kidding me? Trust me! [♪♪] It's so delicious, it makes you want to cry. The first time I ate this, I cried too. This reminds me of my dad. When I was little, my family was very poor. We had to search for food on the streets. One day... my dad brought back half a chicken leg. [CRYING] It tasted exactly like this. So I was determined that-- Your lips are greasy. So I was determined that when I grew up I would make a lot of money. Why make so much money? What's more important than money? What if there wasn't even a drop of clean water or a breath of fresh air on this planet? No amount of money would keep you alive. Do you understand what you're talking about?

I knew you'd be here for teppanyaki, so I brought you some fresh ingredients. Please let us. No. Please go ahead. Let's try Uncle's cooking. No way. Okay. I'll do it. [SIZZLING] Your uncle is interesting. He's very proud of his cooking. So full of himself. [GRUNTING] He loves to perform. [GRINDER WHIRRING] [VOCALIZING PAIN] What happened? He flew out. Huh? He also performs magic tricks. Go clean up. ALL: Yes. Everyone out! You're not human. Your hand. Marry me. [NERVOUS LAUGH] Didn't you say you adored me? I want to marry you. You have it all wrong. It's all right. You wear outdated fashion. You look funny when you eat. Also, you have a strange walk, and you're a bad singer. So what? I like it. Stop joking around with me! There are so many beautiful women around you. They just want my money, but you don't. I have everything now. But I'm lonely. No one understands me in this world but you. But we just met last night! This is my style: efficient, accurate and fierce. I make business decisions worth billions within seconds. But I thought about this the whole night. Enough! Don't say any more! I... It's wrong! It's all wrong! Why are you so foolish? You're the foolish one! Do you know how amazing you are? You're not human. You're an angel! You're the best thing that's ever happened to me!

I ignore you for one day, and you're already messing around. Shan! I'm losing my patience! I'm the one who is losing patience! Stop stalking me! Why can't I be here? Why would I stalk you? Not only do you stalk me, you annoy me too! Having fun? Our business is worth tens of billions. So, what if I annoy you? Getting so close to this strange girl, I think you're crazy! I want out of this deal! You want out? I beg of you: Do it quick! [♪♪] Octopus, have you thought about cutting off another tentacle to wear pants? You think you're so funny. Yes, I'm funny, but I'm even more romantic. If I want to wear pants, I can still do it with three tentacles. See? Right? Sorry. That's okay. Right now, I only care about killing Liu Xuan. We're always failing! Why is that? You like him, don't you? I never liked him! I dare you to look into my eyes and say it again! I dare! Why are you spinning? Who the hell switched on the fan? I did! Weren't you feeling hot? No! Switch it off! Enough! I'm not an actor or a killer! I can't do it! [KNOCKS ON DOOR] Who is it? [♪♪] Switch off the fan! Help! [GASPS] You put sonar transmitters in our ocean! You're responsible for all these deaths! Because of you, many of us died, and families were torn apart! Do you know how much damage you've done? Who gave you the right to destroy our home? Today, we, the mermaids, sentence you to the 18th level of hell! Kill him! [GASPS] [SCREAMS] Wait! If you kill me, the sonar will still be there! He's right. Of course I'm right! I didn't mean to cause you so much pain! Let me go, and I'll turn off the sonar. Let me be helpful for once, okay? Don't believe him! Kill him! I think he has a point. Now you get it! [OCTOPUS GRUNTING IN ANGER] [GASPING FOR AIR] Go! Don't tell me you're in love with him. [SOBBING] [SIGHS] Mr. Liu. Nice to meet you. What can we do for you? What I'm about to tell you. Don't be scared. We're the police. We're not scared of anything. Please begin. I was just... kidnapped by a mermaid. A mermaid? Yes, a mermaid. Like half-human and half-fish. [PEN SCRATCHING] It's not left and right. It's top and bottom. Human top and fish bottom. What about the head? Not with that thing! It's a girl. Damn it. Mermaids! Don't you watch movies? With long hair and a nice figure. Half-human, half-fish. A mermaid. Got it? Got it. Please continue. She said she liked me and wanted to date me. Then she kidnapped me, somewhere in Green Gulf. There were mermaids everywhere. And an octopus. An octopus! With tentacles this long. He tried to strangle me. Shan took a knife and chopped off his tentacle. Then I jumped into the sea. [LAUGHS] What are you laughing at? Just having happy thoughts. What happy thoughts? My wife just had a baby. [LAUGHS] And what are you laughing at? My wife also just had a baby. Your wives are the same person? Right, right. [BOTH LAUGH] [CLEARS THROAT] No, they both gave birth on the same day. Let me make myself clear. I'm not lying! Right, right. [BOTH LAUGH] Why? Let's get back to the case. That creature you just mentioned, the mermaid, was she pretty? It doesn't matter whether she's pretty! She's one of a kind, a rare person. Her eyes are like peas with a garlic-shaped nose and sharp teeth. She's very cute. Too bad it was too dark that night to take a good look at her breasts. What is it with you? I'm losing my patience! My wife had a baby. Think I'm stupid? You're laughing at me! Mr. Liu, we're professionals. We won't laugh. No matter how crazy it is. Unless we can't take it. Mr. Liu, how about you go back home and wait. We'll let you know if we find out anything. All right, please do something, okay? It's very dangerous. Take reinforcements! [OFFICERS LAUGHING] Mr. Liu, anything else? [LAUGHTER STOPS] Mr. Liu? I believe you! You're a tycoon with trillions. Why would you make up such a crazy story? Only a lunatic wouldn't believe you. By the way, I know a great psychiatrist. I'll ask him to come over. Why are you calling a psychiatrist? So we can have some fun. You think I'm crazy too! Damn it! You don't believe me! You don't believe me! Here you are! Where have you been? I was so worried! I meant well earlier. I didn't really mean what I said. Look at you. You're like a child. You have such beautiful legs. My legs aren't the only beautiful thing about me. There's much more to be discovered. Let me see. [CHUCKLES] [EASTERN STRING MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS] Octopus, what should we do now? Wait for death to come. I didn't expect to be betrayed like this. To save the one you love, you're willing to sacrifice everything. This is in our nature. You shouldn't blame yourself. A mermaid falling in love with an evil human. Is there no justice? Love has no law. It is beyond any rules or boundaries. In the Ming Dynasty, over 600 years ago, we barely escaped from the seven attacks of the human navies. Without the generous help of Mr. Zheng, we would have been extinct. Human beings can be evil. But there are good ones too. Love is all around. Love is patience. It can stand the test of time. Never-ending. RUO-LAN: You've been watching this for two hours. Are mermaids your new fetish? Are we destroying the environment? Want to see something more interesting? Come here. [LIVELY CHATTERING ON VIDEO] Have you already seen these? Why don't you care about this? There are many things you don't know about me. Come over here, and I'll show you. I have to go. It's urgent! Don't you dare! Do you realize how lucky you are? Don't miss this chance. [MOANS] I'm sorry! I really have to go. It's urgent. I'm deeply touched. Thanks for your offer. Come back here! I'll call you soon. Come back! Come back! [♪♪] Let me try the sonar. We will now activate the sonar. I have to warn you first. Just cut the crap! Ready? Go ahead! [HIGH-PITCHED PULSING] Stop! [SONAR SHUTS OFF] [COUGHS] [GROANS] Mr. Liu, are you okay? Ow, my head! Damn it! I crapped my pants! That's a normal reaction. I tried to warn you, but you didn't let me. In fact, we reduced it to one-tenth its power. That's impossible! WOMAN: Mr. Liu, why do you want to turn off the sonar? The sonar... is too powerful. You're really funny. The construction has already started! You designed the sonar! I tried it, and I crapped my pants! Human waste is not our expertise. I want it turned off! Authorize it now! We can't do that! It's not possible. What's the matter? WOMAN: Boss, Mr. Liu wants to turn off the sonar and is talking about feces. MAN: That's disgusting! WOMAN: I'm sorry. We don't understand what he's thinking. That's not a surprise. We never know what he's thinking. I agree. Turn off the sonar. [POWERS DOWN] The sonar has been switched off. Good. Thank you, Ruo-lan. You're welcome. You know that I'm always on your side. You must have your reasons. Can you tell me why you're doing this? The sonar is deadly. I crapped my pants. Well done, you finally figured it out. Come. Mermaids really do exist. That girl, Shan, is one of them. And there's more of them! An octopus too! And so...? Our sonar is destroying all marine life. Where are they now? Green Gulf. Inside the wreck on Guillotine Cliff. [LAUGHS] That's why I didn't want to tell you! I regret not telling you now. I believe you. [DOOR BEEPING OPEN] Mr. Liu found a living mermaid in that wreck in Green Gulf. Oh, my God. What is this place? What are you doing, George? Sorry, he's working for me now. George is not only a famous marine biologist, he's also a nutcase, like you. He's been looking for mermaids for a long time. I'm funding his research. Why didn't you tell me? We've been searching for mermaids. We've only found two, and they were dead. We've located that wreck, and there are signs of mermaid activity. Let's go get them! Turning off the sonar is good enough. Why still go after them? Are you crazy? Mermaids. A new species. If we can extract their DNA, we'll control the most advanced biotechnology. It's a huge opportunity. You should know that! But-- Money! Making money! Don't you want money? Yes, I want money! But there must be a limit. We can't go against our moral conscience! [LAUGHS] Conscience? Earth's welfare and world peace will rely on you then, Mr. Conscience! I barely survived that sonar! To hell with the sonar! You only care about that woman! I'm rich and gorgeous. There are lots of men who find me desirable. I spent 30 billion on you, but you treat me like dirt and go chasing some tail! I really-- I'm going to find her and make fish soup out of her! RUO-LAN: Mermaids are a highly intelligent, untamed, mysterious species. They're fierce and capable of making weapons. They're extremely dangerous. So as soon as you see them, use full force! Take preemptive action. Attack them until they cannot fight back. I'd rather have them all dead than let one escape. [ENGINE REVS] Boss! We've got 300 security officers. They're ready to set off any time. We'll shut down Ruo-lan's secret laboratory. Now do you believe me? Now I do. I can't get in touch with Shan. Keep calling her. Make sure the reinforcements get there quickly! Please be careful with my car. I only have three in this model. Let me get this straight: Overthrowing Ruo-lan is like throwing away money. If money is worthless to us now, then those jets, yachts and Romanée-Conti are worthless as well? LIU: Right! [TIRES SCREECH] Yes! Force them out of the water! PRESENTER [IN ENGLISH]: Target is under the water. [GUNS COCKING] Fire! [CAR HORNS HONKING] Move! Is anyone in charge? Where are the police? [GRUNTS WEAKLY] [GRUNTS IN PAIN] [♪♪] Bingo! [GASPS] [GASPING] [ALL GRUNT] [GASPS] [ALL YELLING] [GASPS AND WHIMPERS] [♪♪] [GRUNTING] [GUN COCKS] The sonar is off! It's safe now! Quick, jump! Go all the way down! It's safe now, let's go! He wasn't lying. They're over there! Right there! Out of the way! Go! Hurry! Give it to me! Damn it! [♪♪] Go! Go! You're stuck too? What about the helicopter? The pilot is stuck in traffic too? Go to hell! Stop! My cash and my car for the bike. No way! I'm rushing to my client for her manicure. It's a Lamborghini! Forget about your stupid job! You can have this building worth several billion dollars. That's all I have. My final offer! Ten billion! Hey! [LAUGHS] Mr. Liu... Can't even pick up a manicurist on the street... for 10 billion! Cheng! Kill her! Quick! If you want to kill her, you gotta go through me first! Never mind him! Go on! Are you crazy, bitch! You actually pulled the trigger! Calm down. I'll take you home! [GROANS, LAUGHS] Crazy bitch! Forget me. Don't worry. I'll protect you. [GASPS] [GROANS] [GRUNTING] [COUGHS] Just leave me. No. [SOBBING] [♪♪] [♪♪] My name is Long Jianfei. Thank you for seeing me. I was the first winner of the scholarship you set up three years ago. My schoolmates and I want to express our gratitude. We all think you're a great man. No. You used to be such a successful entrepreneur. Why did you donate all your money to protect the environment? If there weren't a drop of clean water or a breath of fresh air on this planet, then life would be meaningless, no matter how much money you made. Yes. That's so true. So the mermaids-- There are no mermaids. People say you deny the mermaids' existence to protect them. [CHUCKLES] And after you survived that fateful day, you stayed single, waiting for the mermaid to return. That sounds like a movie. Please take a look at this photo. I don't mean to offend you with these questions. As a marine-biology student, these new findings are very important. Scientists should be more objective. You should forget about fairy tales. And... I'm not single, either. Lucy! SHEN: I'm cooking! Come here. SHEN: Okay. Lucy. Hello. We live an ordinary life. Sometimes, we cook together. Have tea together. What else? We also travel. I understand. Go and explore new places. The scenery is beautiful! Very beautiful. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪]
