So, did you go to lots of parties? One brilliant one. I fell asleep on the roof garden as soon as. I got there and by the time I woke up everyone had gone. Were you with anyone? What? When you woke up? I was on my own the whole time. Hey, how is it? Oh, flat out. I know and I have another job in two hours. Yeah? Well, I have chocolate croissants. Oh, thanks, I'm starving. The commercial want get your number did you call. He wants to take me to this place in the country for the weekend. Very sexy voice. He had extremely promising song at that party. Are you going? I'm really wasted but I think I will. And lose the sunshine, thank you. Great. Can we, can we, can we start the mottled effect in the bedroom now? Hey, here she is at last. Can we have a bit of quiet? They booked me in for the show at lunchtime. I didn't know about it till I got off the plane. You're in demand. We won't be able to afford you soon. You still okay for tonight? Definitely. Right, and you haven't mentioned it to anyone, have you? No, why? Oh, you know how it is, gossip. It's the lifeblood of the industry. I got you a welcome home present. But you can't open it now. You must bring it along this evening. See you in a minute. I got the tickets. Sorry? I got the tickets for the Lounge Lizards. Oh, no, I'm going away for the weekend. Where? To Meg's place in Brighton. I promised, I haven't seen her since she's had her baby. Well, I'll, I guess I'll get Imogen to come instead then. Maybe we can catch a movie when I get back? I, I should go to work I suppose, I'll see you later. Sometimes you should just make a clean break. Otherwise, they just keep clinging on thinking they've still got a chance. He's my friend. Hello, who is it? Hello? Bastard. INCOMING CALL UNIDENTIFIED Chloe, we're off. That creep just rang again. Did he say anything? No, he never says anything, he doesn't even breathe. How do you know it's a "he"? It has to be the guy that found my filofax I left it in Cappussionos. Someone turned it in. Two days later the phone calls started. You should call the police. I'll change my number on Monday. We should go. Have a good time, okay? Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Yes, all right, thank you. Chloe. How are you feeling? Gross. Where are we? We're almost there. How long did I sleep? Couple of hours. You can freshen up when we get there. Make yourself look gorgeous. I've told Stan you're rare beauty. Who's Stan? Stanley Kowalski. He wrote Black Hole. One of the great songs of the 80s. Bit before your time, I think. Yeah, it's a great old place. It used to be a hotel, it's about a hundred and fifty years old, I think. Gordon, Chloe. Come in. Are we the last? Yeah, they've all been here for hours. Where are we tonight? The green room. Okay, you wanna get cleaned up don't you, lady? Gordon, see, madam up to her suite will you? The bathroom is up the corridor by the stairs. Television's got a video. There's a whole library of films if you want. Don't worry about the doll, by the way. There's one in every room just about. The people that lived here before left them. I got a fox in mine, Renard the fox. So, how long have you known Ned? Not long, a few months, why? No reason. I'll see you down there. Great, you don't even have the balls to speak. You can't even talk dirty, you are pathetic, you know that. People who do this sort of stuff are really pathetic. Where have you been all this time? I missed you. You only just got back and now you're gone again. I can't keep up with you. The police are tracing this call you know. Jesus. I'm sorry I'm not very good. I just gotta go join the others. Bye. Hiya. Here she is, Dixon's latest squeeze. We can eat at least, this is Chloe, everyone. Chloe, this is Stan, Bryan, Ellis, Vox, Anja and Rachel. Hello, Chloe, everyone, we're starving so we're glad to see you. Bloody famished. Have a seat. Have some mulled wine. I'm gonna give you a mug. You've got a lot of ground to make up. Chloe's just flown in from New York so she's a little bit jet lagged. Oh, you can't afford to be jet lagged. Or you won't get at word in edgeways. You look as if you're in need of a good feed, Chloe, you're not bulimic, are you? She eats like a pig, I can speak, you know. Well, thank God for that. Shut up, Ellis, finish your story. Very well. Mikey was determined to get back on the bandwagon but by then the boys had moved on. And they certainly didn't need any help from a hack image-maker. So, round he goes to Murray Phelps. But there's no way Murray's gonna broker a deal cos he know the boys think he's a fudge packing, Bible bashing plonker. So where are you from exactly? Recognise anyone? I'll tell you what when you're Stateside that's Stan. And what about the big girl with make-up on? That's you. Ned showed us some of your spread in a couple of magazines. You have a really wild look sometimes. Great mouth. I did some modeling for a while but I never had the patience for it. Where did you stay in New York? The Soho Grande. It's kind of new. It's great city. Great energy. There's more energy on the streets than any place I know. Do, do you go there a lot? Oh, I did an album there once Studio in Tribeca. Were you all members? Oh, all, all the boys were, obviously, except for Gordon and Ray. I was still at school. Ray was kind of our PR lady. Stan's still in the business still writing. Still hovering on the edge of greatness. What sort of stuff do you write? Just stuff I like. And no-one else does. Very true. Here she's the world champion. Did you win? It's a bit late, say we'll, we'll play tomorrow, yeah? Oh, take that thing out, they're poisonous. It's a taxi. Oh, Jesus. Hello, Eve, come in, join the party. Sorry to barge in. When I heard you were all getting together I felt a tiny bit left out. Did you forget to tell me? No, I thought you were busy. It's not really a proper reunion, is it, with one person missing? This is Anja, Vox and Chloe, Gordon's latest squeeze. You're doing well for yourself Gordon. How is everybody? Very jolly? Oh, exceedingly jolly, Eve. Well, especially for seeing you. D'you drive all the way up here on your own? We could've driven up together. I wasn't sure I was gonna make it myself actually didn't think I was gonna get back from the studio in time. You could've given Chloe a lift. Save Gordon the trouble of driving all the way up to London and back. Oh, come on, Eve. We all know Ned's an arsehole, why rub it in? Did you have a good chat on the way up? I was asleep most of the way. Did you have a late night? It's so hard to imaging anyone being bored by Ned. He's such an entertaining creep. Oh, have you cut yourself? No, I don't think so. Oh, just come into the kitchen. What were we talking about? Is she Ned's girlfriend? She's his wife actually. I didn't even know he was married. Oh, it's just a tiny cut there. At least he could've told me. Well, we assumed you knew. Sorry. Is she fading away? Not quiet. I was hoping she might bleed to death. Eve, come and have some dinner. It's far more interesting out here. Eve.. Are you okay? I just need a bit of fresh air. Hello, lady. Where d'you wander off to? Ned couldn't find you. Well suddenly I'm in the middle of some awful marriage row. I know, he's a fucking idiot. But he's gone now, they both have. What do you mean they're gone? I kicked them out him and Eve. Becoming very boring. What am I gonna do? You may as well stay. Everyone else is. Sleep in all morning, someone will give you a lift. I can't believe he didn't tell me he was married. Relationships get so messy. I don't know any that aren't. It's all a balance of energy. Energy turning sour. Chemistry. How long have you and Rachel been together? Oh, couple of hundred years. Did you meet through music? She was a groupie. Catholic. Catholic girls always go berserk whey they finish school. Are you Catholic? Oh, you're lucky or unlucky depending on your point of view. Come on, I'll show you my studio. Where dreams are made. It's great you do your own stuff. So many people sell out. We did once. Black Hole? I love Black Hole. I don't see that as selling out at all. Have you got it here? Sure. What are you working on now? Jack, it's about a gourmet sex maniac. Jack thinks nothing means anything except the basics. Food, drink, sex, lying on a beach with the sun on your back. I think it's a bit sad if that's all there is. I don't think it's sad. Everything else we try and say is important is bullshit basically. Coming is our Sort of one genuine glimpse of nirvana. Don't you think? I don't know. Do you remember your first? It's beautiful seeing people come. Especially when they're torn. Part of them doesn't want to let go part of them tells them it's bad but their body's telling them the opposite. Can we go now? Where are the others? Gone back to London. I thought they were staying, I was gonna get a lift with them tomorrow morning. Gordon'll take you. I could have gone with them tonight. What are you filming? The day. He makes a film of everyday. He's a video diary proust. I think I'm gonna call a taxi. And go where? I don't think you'll get one this time of the night. Where are we? Devon. What about the taxi Eve came in? Probably got it in knightbridge. Would've cost her two hundred quid. Gordon'll come and tuck you in. I'm only joking. Toby? Hi, are you in Brighton? Is it raining over there? There's a huge storm here. Yeah, it's just started. Maybe it'll clear up by tomorrow. So, how's the baby? Beautiful. So, Monday, maybe? I'll give you a call when I get back. Sweet dreams. Big kiss. Oh, I thought you'd be in bed, I brought you a nightcap. Oh, no, thanks. I'll pass out if I have any more to drink. Sorry about Ned. It must have been embarrassing. It was. So, these pictures in here. They're obviously quite provocative. But I'm interested in your approach and how much is you and how much is the photographer. I don't really think about it much. I just give them what they want sexy pictures. But it is your interpretation of what's sexy. You're sort of jeering at the world and... and saying I know you're turned on wouldn't you like to have this? Well, tough. They're just images. Oh, sure, there's nothing particularly originally in what you're doing except. You add this know quality. I'm turning into a prune, I should get out. Is that how you see yourself? It's just a performance, a way of getting out of myself, I suppose. Which, I guess, is why I like it. That's interesting. Okay. I, brought your some more towels. I really don't need anything else, okay. Freaks. Will you come into my room for a moment. You put those there, didn't you? No. They've been there for a while. They were in my bag under the bed. Ned must have put them there. They were just a stupid present. Please don't come into my room any more. Oh, we found some more pictures of you. What? You were in Jamaica or somewhere. I'm going to be now, please go. Somewhere hot. Palm trees and all that on the beach. You looked really good. I'm going to cal Rachel in a minute. People have passwords, don't they. And if things get too heavy they can say the special password like a safety word and whoever it is stop. Are you leaving? What's wrong? Nothing. Nothing, something woke me up. Probably the wind. I was just checking the roof. TV aerial's down. Better see how your windows are. They're okay. Some of the wood's starting to rot. Do you play any musical instruments. What? Do you play any musical instruments. I played piano for a while. why d'you stop? What? The piano? More interested in boys? Probably. You say probably a lot. Do I? Probably. Done. It's all right, I've got it. Thirsty girl. Have you got any brothers and sisters? Sorry? Have you got any brothers and sisters? Two. Brothers? Why? Because you're comfortable with men. You're not shy at all. Ah, it's all right. It's not an antique. Probably both older, are they? Who? Your brothers? I bet they used to spoil you blind, did they? Probably. You see, there you go again. Hey, do you want me to take your shoes off? I'm going to sleep. - Who is it? - Me. What's wrong? It's the middle of the night. I feel really strange. I had these pills. I think they reacted weird with the wine. Are, are you with Ned? Is he there now? Look, you, you keep breaking up, are you all right? What day is it? God, you really are out of it, it's Saturday night. Chloe? Can you hear me? She's off her head on something, don't. Chloe? Are you okay? It's all right, it's all right, I just... I'm still half asleep. All right, call me tomorrow, yeah? I was trying to have a conversation. Stop it, I wanna go to sleep. Don't. I wasn't to go to sleep. Shit. What's wrong with you? Come on, honey, if you wanna do it for the camera baby, you're gonna have to do it for some friends. Course I can. Come on, good girl. Good girl You shower with your clothes on, Monica. Good girl. Lovely. I've got her. Clive? Coming. Oh, sorry, darling. Margarita tidied my pills away as usual I can't find them anywhere. That's the first place I looked. Those gremlins have been at it again. I thought I might take Tarzan for a walk. Before it rains. I could pick up that book you ordered if you like. Well, I haven't finished the Graham Greene yet. Ah, you'll be through it by tomorrow you're so quick. If I could get through my stuff at work half as fast I'd never have to do any overtime again. Anything we need from the shop? No, I don't think so. Thought we'd have baked potatoes? Do you feel like potatoes in their jackets and the rest chicken? Lovely. Tarzan. Do you want a walk? Walkies. Come here, come here to dad. Come here, my boy, walkies. Let's go, let's go. Come on. How's your head? Sore. Surprised. You were pretty ripped last night. What were you on? How did I get down here? You bumped your head. How many times have you woken up in a strange place and no idea where you are and strange people in bed beside you? Where's the bathroom? You gave us a bit of fright. Why was that? Suddenly you go running off into the middle of the night. We were all looking for you. Don't you remember? Something freaked you out. You really seemed to be having a good time? What do you mean was having a good time? You were having a good time. Will you please turn that off? This music is making me mad. I have to get back to London. When are the others going back? They left last night, don't you remember? Will you indo this? Oh, you forgot these. You always travel with these, do you? What, what are you doing? Stop it, let go. What are you doing? What are you doing? Oh, this is great. This is really breaking new ground. You can't just lock people away you know. What is she gonna say when you let her go. Depends. What are you gonna use your charm on her, it's a bit rusty, I think. She saw the tape. Maybe she was dreaming. Are you gonna call Ned? Why? Well, she's his friend. Maybe, she's interesting. She's feisty. She's just a blank face. It's not her personality in the pictures. You're not jealous, are you, Ray? I thought we got through that fifteen years ago. No, it is not about that, it's... you just have to keep pushing things further and further. Maybe you should drink a little less in the mornings. I dunno. Seeing what turns you on these days. If I knock myself out you might get interested.. Later... see you later. This is ridiculous. I know, it's is my brother. Playing games. It's not a game. If you don't let me go I'm gonna have to tell the police. I brought you some toast. You've probably got a hangover, have you. We've all got hangovers. Look... where's Rachel? Does Rachel know I'm here? It's amazing, isn't it? Those pictures in the magazines. It's all make-up, isn't it? Isn't it? You're quite normal looking really aren't you? What's this about? I don't remember anything from last night. I had a lot of pills and a lot to drink. I was really tired. It's just Stan. He's a bit nervous. Hey, Toby. Hi, Mich. She's still in Brighton. I know. She called last night. What time did you speak to her? Late. And how did she sound? Fine. Good. She sounded really out of it when I spoke to her. I left some things in her room I couple of tapes. See you later. You're in trouble, aren't you? We all are. You always like stuck up girls. You like bringing them down to your level. Yeah, I know. I've been a bit off the wall lately. But it hasn't been easy getting through to you either, you know. You're starting to lapse back into it. I wonder why. We've got to stick together. I think I'll go and finish that report. Yeah, okay, love. Good luck. I'm gonna heat up the rest of the curry. Are you the one who rings all the time? Look, whoever you are, don't hang up. I'm trapped in a room. This is true. It's in a place called The Lavers Hill Lodge. It used to be a hotel. I think it's in Devon, maybe. No one needs to know who you are. Just call the police. Can you undo these? My wrists are really sore. They're yours, aren't they? I mean... thought you'd be used to them. We both know what's going on so we can both talk, okay? All right. There was a vibe between you and Stan right from the start. I'm not blind. There was nothing coming from me I wasn't even attracted to him. I was in the music scene for years when I was your age. So nothing surprises me. I don't know what happened last night. I don't know what all this is about. Chloe. You might have been out of it for a couple of minutes, I dunno. But for the rest of the time you were having a ball. I came in. I saw you. So don't try and wriggle out of it now just cos you feel you've been a bad girl. I'm working tomorrow. All of my friends will be wondering where I am. He just needs some kind of reassurance that you're not gonna try and twist things around. Look. I do sort of remember. Maybe I was into it. I just feel really strange and embarrassed. I'll tell him. What's that doing there? Are you a gymnast? Did you pick this up with your feet? I tried but it fell on the floor. Do I believe you or not? I'm not gymnast. Oh yeah, you've got a figure. Gymnasts don't have figures. I think it's outrageous what they do getting them into it when they're so young. I mean, sometimes their spines end up getting deformed. Stan. Gordon. Didn't you see the telephone in the bag? It was nowhere near her. Well, she's a contortionist, you see. Got it out with her feet and held it up to her face and told whoever it was to tell the police. But she says it fell on the floor. I think I believe her. Because her legs aren't long enough and because she'd be feeling brave if she's got through to someone. And she doesn't look so brave at the moment. In fact she looks rather good when she's nervous. You're really brave, aren't you? You have to knock people out so you can do whatever you want with them. That's really brave. Stop. We're gonna negotiate. Take the bag away. What are you going to do? Have a wee smoke with Chloe... Calm her down a bit. Stan. It's okay. Nobody's gonna get hurt. Come on... take a puff. Now... let's think about this. First of all it's your word against ours. Gordon? She didn't see anything. It wouldn't matter anyway... just be another video. What are you laughing at? What do you mean? What do you mean? About it being another video. To Teresa. I don't think she can tell the difference. Cartoon characters. Soaps. Real people... I don't think there's any difference as far as she's concerned. Only thing that means anything to her is ping-pong. Which is a mindless game. Which is why it appeals to our... to our mindless daughter. Why don't you go and see your girlfriend? She's so stoned even you might have a chance of chatting her up. You shower with your clothes on, Moni? Moni, it's a soap commercial, baby. Soap commercial. What do you sing in the shower, Mon? Singing in the Rain? I never sing, I don't know anything. You can sing, Moni. You can sing God Save The Queen Moni, God Save The Queen. Good girl. Music... art of any kind... reflects a balance of energies. And your youth arrogance could work really well in this house. You know, Gandhi used to sleep between two sixteen year old girls in his old age. So did. I know you're awake I know you better than you know yourself. Hey, I haven't played you any of my latest stuff. You can give me an honest opinion. I'm sure of you will. What does it matter what I think? I'm curious, that's all. I hate it. Does it scare you? It scares me thinking where it comes from. Well, then, I'm just being honest to myself aren't I? That's what art's all about. Everything's been going so well for you hasn't it? It's all come so easy. You really lost control there, didn't you? You don ' t like losing control. I could tell that last night. That's what you've gotta do. Let yourself go fall back into the void. I'll catch you. You're in early Mr. Myers. See if you can get and address for this hotel, will you. It's in Devon. Try the Tourist Board. Get them to check the records for a couple of years back. It might not be registered any more. They just take special guests these days. It's meant to be very good apparently I might take my wife for a break. Gordon. She was here the other night. The bus will coming in a minute. Have you packed your homework? There's no way she could know. Gordon, will you tell your brother there's nothing to worry about. There's no way I'd tell anyone because of the publicity. I bought Reynard to keep you company. That's nice. I used to think the big toe was supposed to be the longest. Cos that's how they always are in kids books. But really... it's the second toe that's longer, isn't it? I used to be really embarrassed about mine but actually they're normal. Yeah... we get embarrassed about such stupid things. Please don't. I like knees... cos they're not perfect. Your boyfriend's coming over. Ned? He's certainly not my boyfriend. I don't have a boyfriend. Is there someone you like? Not really. What's her name? Roxanne. Do you get to see her much? She visits sometimes. I'd really like a place like this to come down to. You're a bit obvious. What do you mean? You want me to think that you'd come down to see me. Gordon? I'm not just those pictures. I'm a person. Look at me. When you close the door, I'm still here. having thoughts and feelings just like you would. It's weird, isn't it? But we've become lovers. She went to a party in the country just a friend's party... Hang on a second do you get to see her much? Anyone to know she was seeing Ned did she? Definitely not. I don't know who it was, all right, Kim. I'll get her to call you as soon as she gets in. How's Chole? Are you a friend of hers? Well, I see her around. We chat. She's everywhere these days, isn't she? Has she gone away again? What's your name? Clive. You didn't happen to find her address book, did you, Clive? I beg you pardon? I'd, I'd best be off. Come on, Tarzan. Lavers Hill Lodge. To the police. Take a look at this. I don't care about any of that. Can someone just tell me how Chole found the tapes? It was four in the morning. She wasn't supported to wake up for another ten hours. How was school? She's okay. This is a crazy situation. I mean, this girl's smart, you know she's not some kind of bimbo. You just have to talk to her. Yeah... and say what? Pour oil on troubled water. But remember... she knows all about you. One of the others was on the tape. Gordon's very systematic, you see. Keeps all his tapes in categories. Theresa? Is that your name? Come here. You can't unlock them. They've the only keys. Please go and tell someone. God, you can't understand me. Please, go and tell someone. Hide under the bed. It's not locked. My brother been visiting, has he? I'll leave you to it. You were the last one in there. I locked it, I swear. Where's Theresa? You're like a pimp for them, aren't you? How many others have you brought here? Look, nothing like this has ever happened before, okay? No-one's ever done anything they didn't want to be doing. I wasn't even awake they're gonna make another video. And you have to be you have to be having a good time. You have to make it obvious. So if you ever did decide to tell anyone about it then. They'd be able to, you know... They'd be able to show it to prove that you were, into it. They they'll let me go. Oh, yeah, yeah. Of course. You're amazing, you know that? You're the most pathetic. Do you really think I'm gonna do that with these people? With you. I don't think you understand. Stan is a really weird guy, you know. Of course he's fucking weird guy. He's kept me trapped down here for two fucking days. He has something over you doesn't he? Has Theresa been in here? I don't think you're telling the truth. Don't hurt her. Bad girl. What's that? It's the front door. Do you have a room for the night? This hasn't been a hotel for years. I got the address from an old brochure. Fuck off. Why are you sitting in the dark? Sometimes we imagine things. Don't close your eyes. Don't close your eyes. Please. You haven't eaten anything all day. If you don't eat anything I'll tell your father. Look at me... All right. If you're gonna sulk I'll leave you in the dark. You're so tired. You had such a good time in New York. Chole. She told me. She couldn't handle the publicity. She's agreed to do the others tape. Well, she would, wouldn't she? She chops and changes all the time. Yes, but it's her word against ours. No, oh, she's got a witness now. Anyway.. if she's not around. Nobody's gonna take much notice of anything Theresa comes out with. I don't. I know. Energy turned snour Curdled. Has to be eliminated. Stan, what are you saying? I don't, I don't understand. Well, you and I'd be pushing fifty at least. What are you talking about? I didn't do anything. You brought her here. Anyway, there's always the possibility of one or two other skeletons dropping out of the closet. Christ. Yes? Ray, ray, are you listening to this? You live in a fantasy world, man. It's just chance. Random. Just the way it's worked out. Let it go. It's all an illusion. Or is that just bullshit? There's never enough time, is there? To work it out. Bit of a conundrum, life. Her name is Chloe Keen. She's a fashion model. And what's your name, sir? Well, why do you need to know that? I know she's in there. And you're saying it's the... Lavers Hill Lodge. That's right. Used to be a hotel. We're accessories, Ray. You know that, Ray. Ray.. We're accessories. We're accessories. What the fuck am I gonna do? Fuck. What? What is it? I don't understand. Just take your time. Get back in the car, please, please. I know where they are, quick, get in the car. If they drain it in a hundred years time she died of an overdose. Poor old Ned panicked. His word against ours. Have you got your camera? There's a pity. What if it was you in there? It's her or us, the law of the jungle. Gordon.. Guilt is creeping weakness. It's like a disease. Help, somebody, I can't breathe, please. I can't breathe. Stan.. Help, please. What if they hear the banging? Look as if you're doing something to it. What? Use your fucking imagination for once. What's wrong? Where are you going? Well, just exploring. There's nothing much of interest down here, it's just a rubbish tip. Well, I might just stretch my legs. It's actually private property. Well, I thought it was a tip. Well, it was the land's recently been bought for development. There's no sign up. I told you, it's only just been bought. Sorry, you'd better turn round, go back the way you came. Are you the owner? Yeah, I work for the company that owns it. What's the name of the company? I don't have to stand here talking to you. This private property, you're trespassing. This is bullshit. What did you say? Just get back in the car and go back the way you came. It's all right now, you're safe, come on. It's all over, love. You did have to work late. Bit of a crisis... but it's all sorted now. Are you hungry? Starved. Just have to warm it up. Be ready in five minutes. Macaroni cheese. Wonderful. Have they found him yet? No, but I'm sure they will. Toby? Do you wanna come around? I need a bit of hug. On my way. On my way. On my way.
