WHO ARE YOU? >> THE SCARS -- THEY DISGUISE ME. THEY HIDE THE MAN I USED TO BE. THE SHARK -- SHE DID THIS TO ME. GAVE ME SOMETHING TO REMEMBER HER BY. >> YOU NEVER ANSWERED MY QUESTION. >> WE'VE NEVER MET. IF YOU KNOW MY FACE, YOU MUST HAVE SEEN IT IN THE NEWSPAPER OR MAYBE ON TV. I CAME TO THIS WRETCHED TOWN 12 YEARS AGO. MY TEAM AND I WERE INVESTIGATING THE DISAPPEARANCE OF WILDLIFE AFTER THE BIG EARTHQUAKE. >> PROFESSOR JONATHAN HOFFMAN, AN ANIMAL BIOLOGIST THAT DIED OUT HERE 12 YEARS AGO. >> DISAPPEARED. >> SO, YOU ARE HIM? >> I WAS HIM ONCE. >> WHY ARE YOU PRETENDING YOU'RE DEAD? >> I USED TO BELIEVE THAT THE WORLD DESERVED TO KNOW THE EVOLUTION OF DIFFERENT SPECIES.

WHY NOT GO BACK TO YOUR LIFE? >> THE BEAST KEEPS ME HERE. WE HAVE A SCORE TO SETTLE. >> IT'S BEEN 12 YEARS. YOU DON'T SEEM TO BE IN ANY RUSH. >> YOU DON'T THINK I HAVEN'T HUNTED HER TIME AND TIME AGAIN? ALL I WANTED TO DO WAS DIE. IT WOULDN'T LET ME DIE. IT TORTURES ME. IT TORMENTS ME. IT FEEDS OFF MY ANGUISH, MY SUFFERING. IT KEEPS ME HERE. IT TEASES ME. IT HAUNTS ME IN MY DREAMS. WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT AN ANIMAL. SHE'S THE DEVIL HERSELF. >> I KILLED ONE YEARS AGO, AND NOW IT'S TAKEN AWAY ALMOST EVERYTHING I'VE EVER CARED ABOUT. THAT DEMON HAS NO SOUL. IT KEEPS ME ALIVE JUST TO FEED OFF MY PAIN. I KNOW WHAT YOU FEEL LIKE. HELP ME KILL THIS THING ONCE AND FOR ALL. >> WHATEVER IT TAKES, YOU CAN COUNT ME IN. >> THANKS FOR THE DRINK, STEVE. >> ANYTIME. >> SEE YA, JACK. >> GOOD LUCK, FELLAS. >> LET'S DO THIS. >> HEY, NEIL. >> WHAT A BUNCH OF KOOKS. >> TELL ME ABOUT IT. >> I'LL HAVE A CUTTY SHARK.

GET ANY PICTURES OF YOUR SHARK? >> NO -- NOTHING AT ALL. I DON'T GET IT. I'D BE HAPPY WITH ANYTHING -- A BIRD, A DEER. THERE'S NOTHING. >> I'M TELLING YOU, MAN, THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA FIND THIS CREATURE IS IF YOU GO OUT THERE AND YOU LOOK FOR IT. >> MAYBE WE CAN SET THE CAMERA UP SOMEWHERE ELSE. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN A BAD LOCATION. >> OR MAYBE WE CAN PUT SOME NICE, FRESH MEAT ON YOUR NECK AND YOU CAN DO A LITTLE DANCE TO ENTICE IT. >> I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR SENSE OF HUMOR. >> WELL, THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE ONE. WELL, GOOD MORNING, SUNSHINE. >> UGH. IT'S TOO EARLY IN THE MORNING TO DEAL WITH YOU. >> OH, COME ON, TINA. THAT'S NO WAY TO -- >> TINA?! I'M WENDY! >> I'M SORRY. YOU REMIND ME OF A TINA I KNOW. >> HOW MANY DAYS HAVE I PUT UP WITH YOUR INCOMPETENCE AND YOU STILL DON'T EVEN KNOW MY NAME? >> I'M SURE YOU REMEMBER MINE, THOUGH. >> ARE YOU SERIOUS? ARE YOU REALLY JUST TRYING TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOUR INEPTITUDE AS A WAY TO HIT ON ME? UGH. I NEED COFFEE. >> YOU'RE A REAL LADIES' MAN, CAMERON. >> SHE'LL GROW TO LOVE ME. >> OH, I'M SURE OF IT. >> GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE. >> MORNING, DON. >> IT'S OFF TO A FINE START, INDEED. >> GOOD MORNING, DONALD. >> WENDY. >> ANYTHING TURN UP ON YOUR CAMERA, LINC? >> NO -- NOTHING AT ALL. >> I SAY WE GO OUT THERE AND JUST LOOK FOR THE DAMN THING. ALL THIS SCIENCE CRAP IS JUST A WASTE OF TIME. >> ANYTHING SHOW UP IN YOUR SAMPLES, WENDY? >> NO -- NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY. >> SO, IT'S NOT GENETICALLY MUTATED OR FROM A DIFFERENT PLANET. WELL, THAT'S JUST GREAT NEWS. IT CAN DIE. LET'S JUST GO. >> THERE ARE STILL TESTS WE CAN RUN TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE CREATURE. >> [ SIGHS ] WE'VE DONE THIS YOUR WAY LONG ENOUGH. IT'S HIGH TIME WE DO IT MY WAY. PEOPLE AROUND HERE ARE JUST GONNA KEEP GETTING KILLED UNTIL WE STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND GET RID OF THIS THING. NOW, AFTER I KILL IT, YOU CAN ALL JUST GO AHEAD AND RUN YOUR TESTS AND TAKE YOUR PICTURES, WASTE ALL THE TIME YOU WANT. >> I HATE TO SAY IT, BUT HE'S PROBABLY RIGHT. WE NEED TO GET OUT THERE AND FIND THIS THING. >> WE NEED TO LEARN MORE BEFORE WE GO OUT THERE AND USE OURSELVES AS BAIT, DON. >> YOU AND WENDY CAN STAY HERE. CAMERON AND I CAN GO OUT AND TAKE CARE OF THIS THING. >> NOW WE'RE TALKIN'. >> I'M NOT WAITING AROUND HERE WHILE YOU GUYS GO AND HUNT THIS THING. >> NO, IT'S NOT SAFE OUT THERE, SUGAR. YOU JUST WAIT HERE AND RELAX. WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT. >> STOP USING PET NAMES ON ME. I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF. >> SOMEBODY GIVE ME A GUN. >> [ Laughing ] OH, RELAX, LINC. YOU WOULDN'T KNOW HOW TO HANDLE ONE EVEN IF I DID TRUST YOU ENOUGH TO USE ONE. >> I KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT HANDLING A WEAPON, CAMERON. JUST BECAUSE I'M NOT INBRED LIKE YOURSELF DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING. >> I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHETHER TO PUNCH YOU IN THE MOUTH FOR DISRESPECTING ME OR PAT YOU ON THE BACK FOR FINALLY GROWING A PAIR OF BALLS. >> JUST GIVING ME A WEAPON WILL SUFFICE. >> YOU'RE SERIOUS? >> COMPLETELY. [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING ] >> WILL DO. DON'T SUPPOSE YOU WANT ONE, TOO, NOW, DO YOU? >> I'M COMING ALONG TO DO WHAT I CAME HERE FOR, NOT HUNT A SHARK. >> THEN LET'S DO IT. [ MUSIC CONTINUES ] >> DO YOU SEE SOMETHING, DON? >> NO. THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED ABOUT. IT'S CLOSE. >> GETTING A LITTLE NERVOUS, THERE, COWBOY? >> ALL OF A SUDDEN, I GOT A REALLY BAD FEELING ABOUT ALL THIS. >> WHAT'S THE PLAN? >> WE STICK TOGETHER.

I NEVER SHOULD HAVE COME OUT HERE! >> JUST RELAX, WENDY. I'M NOT GONNA LET ANYTHING HURT YOU. >> THERE IT IS! >> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! >> WENDY! >> AAAH! AAAAH! >> DAMN IT! >> Y-YOU'LL SHOOT HER! >> SHE'S ALREADY AS GOOD AS DEAD! >> AAAAAAAAAAH! >> WHERE'D IT GO?! >> WE'RE ALL GONNA DIE! >> NOBODY ELSE IS DYING OUT HERE! AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! HELP ME! >> WHERE'D IT GO? >> I DON'T KNOW! I DON'T KNOW! [ GUNS COCK ] >> HOLD UP, THERE, BEFORE YOU KILL SOMEBODY. >> WE HEARD GUNSHOTS. IS EVERYTHING OKAY? >> NO. IT'S NOT OKAY. THE SHARK -- IT KILLED TWO OF US. WE ALL NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE NOW. >> WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, DON, WE CAME OUT HERE TO KILL THE BEAST. I AIN'T LEAVIN' TILL EITHER IT OR MYSELF ARE DEAD. >> SAME HERE. >> SO BE IT. >> YOUR FIDGETY LITTLE BUDDY HERE CAN LEAVE, THOUGH. >> NO. I'M STAYING. >> SUIT YOURSELF. JUST STAY OUT OF MY WAY. >> WHO ARE YOU? >> IT'S A LONG STORY, AND TIME REALLY ISN'T ON OUR SIDE AT THE MOMENT. >> WHAT I'M CURIOUS ABOUT IS WHO IS THIS GUNSLINGER, AND WHY IS HE OUT HERE WITH YOU, DON? >> THE NAME'S LINCOLN ANDERSON. I'M A CRYPTOZOOLOGIST. >> SO, YOU PRETTY MUCH MAKE SOME SORT OF LIVING OFF OF RESEARCHING THINGS THAT DON'T EXIST. >> LIKE A DAMN SHOW SHARK? >> POINT TAKEN. MY APOLOGIES. >> I HATE TO INTERRUPT THE INTRODUCTIONS, BUT WE'VE STILL GOT A BLOODTHIRSTY SHARK OUT THERE. >> WE NEED TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO KILL THIS THING. >> WE SHOT IT. I KNOW WE HIT IT. BUT THE THING DIDN'T DIE. >> WITH THAT LITTLE PEA SHOOTER? NO WONDER. >> IT WAS JUST HERE. I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU INTEND TO BRING IT BACK. >> I'VE BEEN STUDYING THIS CREATURE FOR YEARS. I BELIEVE IT'S ATTRACTED TO HEAT. >> WELL, IF THERE'S ANYTHING LEFT OF YOUR FRIENDS, WE COULD ALWAYS USE THEM AS CHUM. >> WATCH WHAT YOU SAY! >> SETTLE DOWN. WE HAVE ENOUGH GOING ON. WE DON'T NEED TO FIGHT AMONGST EACH OTHER. >> SO, IF YOU'RE RIGHT AND THIS THING IS ATTRACTED TO HEAT -- AND SAY IT ISN'T ALREADY FULL -- WHAT CAN WE DO TO ATTRACT IT, LURE IT IN TO US, WITHOUT GETTING OURSELVES KILLED? >> WE CREATE A REALLY BIG FIRE. >> ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? >> HOW'S THAT GONNA DO ANYTHING? >> IT'LL DRAW HER IN, AND WE'LL BE WAITING. IF I'M RIGHT, THE HEAT PROJECTED FROM THE FIRE WILL CONFUSE HER AND PREVENT HER FROM FOCUSING IN ON US. WHEN SHE SURFACES, THAT'S WHEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE OUR SHOT, AND SHE'LL NEVER SEE IT COMING. >> LET'S DO THIS. [ SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING ] >> EVERYBODY GET INTO POSITION. COME GET ME, YOU WRETCHED WHORE. >> NO! >> [ SNARLING ] >> AAAAAAAAAAH! >> AAAAH! >> AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!

AAAAAAAAH! >> [ SNARLING ] >> [ LAUGHING MANIACALLY ] [ CRYING ] >> I THINK WE SHOULD GO. >> I'M RIGHT BEHIND YOU. >> [ SOBBING ] >> WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT HIM? WAIT. THAT SEEMS TO COME ALL TOO EASY FOR YOU. >> WELL, WHAT AM I GONNA DO -- LET HIM SUFFER? >> LISTEN, I KNOW I MIGHT BE WRONG, BUT THE BEST CHANCE OF US GETTING OUT OF HERE ALIVE IS IF WE JUST KEEP HIM ALIVE LONG ENOUGH FOR US TO DISTRACT THIS THING. >> [ SOBBING CONTINUES ] >> LET'S GET THE HELL OUT OF HERE. >> [ SOBBING CONTINUES ] >> [ ROARS ] >> COME AND GET ME, YOU BITCH! >> THE SON OF A BITCH DID IT. >> I'M GONNA CALL IT IN.
