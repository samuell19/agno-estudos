Three months ago. - I have to let me die? - Yes, that's what I've done. Look. Your life has stopped, but mine did not. - I have not had one appointment. - And what? You can do whatever you want. Like you. Exactly. Think... What you need! - Quen told you this would happen? - The trouble with you... Shut up you two! While on this elevator no talk. understand? If you want to discuss, do it quietly. This place is very small and I may lose my temper! Understood? ... Do not seek. It's nice here... I come here to flee the city. You're lucky. I think so. I have to tell you something. Your big secret? Look... Who can it be? Do not you care? No. Surely not. All?? What happens? Why? Are you serious? Stop the nonsense! And they are sure it was him? It is not a joke... She is fine? Well. No. .. I'll call you. Thank you. Listen to this. Know that Tony not come to work yesterday... Then it was because he fled from police. Sold to Heather to a prostitution ring. You kidding? No, it was Emily. It is not the first time. Fortunately for Heather, the police have caught. It can not be novelty! We have problems, but when you see things like this... It is always the same conversation we repeat again and again. I do not see it. You always see things the way you want. Not true. Yes it's true. You're well. Your fucking fill everything quickly. Give me an example. - I could give you hundreds. - And... When we went to listen to Dalai Lama in Central Park. The woman who stood before neither of us could move. And you did not you stop beating him until they had to go. He made no effort. Moreover, it was a bitch. We were there to see the dalai lama. 40 000 fibulae listened his words of peace and love and you beat her as a matter of space! The Dalai Lama has come to Central Park? Yes. I love how it works in "Falcon Crest." But you're stupid! This is Lorenzo Lamas. The dalai lama, is your grandfather. Saying? I do not want to sleep alone. I have to say... It is not sex. I prefer to know you better. We sleep together. With shorts. I promise not to try anything. Unless you who you want. That would change everything. I like you, you know. You're comfortable. Yes? It's weird. But it's like you already knew. I know. It's like in "Pretty Woman." It seems natural for Richard Gere Julia Roberts marries. Really believe in their relationship. But when I think of it, first is a prostitute second, known from only one week. It makes no sense. But, however, is fine. It is. When you sleep with someone, not bad waking up together. I could not sleep. Do not bother come back now? I have some things to do in the city this morning. You do not want breakfast? No, that's right. - What is happening? - Nothing. Do not think I've forgotten. At the end did not tell me your big secret. It's nothing. On another occasion. What happens? Nothing. Displaying your attitude not say that. It's a little early. You understand? Simply put, I'll wait. I love you, that's all. You say that without knowing anything about me! But if I love everything about you? Yes. I get dressed. Look... I have something to say. You might not know at all, but I feel something. and I know you too. Now I'm going to dress. Sorry. You know I'm a bit overwhelmed. I know. - Sorry for your appointment. - No, sorry. You're right. He had not been so happy some time now. I'm glad to have stayed. locked in the elevator At least you're honest. I let things happen. You do not try to control everything. This is new... for me, really. Why is this happening to us? Should be written. You're the only one who can put me in my place. You are my family. You are my life. - All that? - And a bag of potatoes. - There must be changes. - I will do whatever is necessary. - I'll even electrochocs. - You need them. - I will submit to torture for you. - Leave it. I've missed. You sure you want to join? No, but Ted told me to come. Tell all to Michael, for all of this can be arranged. Because it is the same as you leave when he hears or that you do not tell and you leave. You're right. I know. - I'm glad you came. - Ted, how are you? My friend Sarah, Ted. - Hello. - Nice. It's your girlfriend? No. A friend. Thank God. - Sorry... - Want a drink. Ian, I wanted to ask if you want to take the place of Tony. As an assistant? No, as my masseuse. Of course, as an assistant!

It does not want to return... to do that anymore. Really needed the money. Y? I want you to know he's a good boy. And I believe that what fooled by that? I got into the business it is evident he is not a hustler. And do you know that too. That's it? Yes. - Yes Who is it? - Yo. Do not go. I can? Yes. Sign. - You first. - No, you. He had tried to tell you. I know. I was very stoked. How long were you doing? Few months. Why? When Douglas left me I wanted to come back. I tried to find a job even pass an exam...

It starts to get hot here... Thank you. So... We might get one of these evenings? Going to the movies, walk naked, or something else. Something else? Seriously... sorry about yesterday. All right. I have in my head... many ways to make you forgive. Oh yeah?
