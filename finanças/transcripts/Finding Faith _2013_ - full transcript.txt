Sheriff: CAN GOOD ACTUALLY COME FROM EVIL? I DIDN'T THINK SO. ABOUT 10 MILES EAST OF THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS IS A LITTLE TOWN SOME CALL THE BEDROCK. I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL. FOR SO MANY HERE, THIS TOWN IS JUST THAT. Preacher: FROM THE LORD INTO THE HOMES OF THE FAMILIES OF OUR CHURCH AND TO ALLOW THEM... ...EVERYTHING THAT THEY DO AS A FAMILY, THAT THEY'RE GONNA MINISTER TO AND BRING THIS CHILD UP IN THE ADMONITION OF THE LORD. SO THAT'S WHAT WE DO TODAY. Sheriff: I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST FOUND FAITH. I WAS SITTING IN A CHURCH ON A SUNDAY FINALLY REALIZING THERE WERE THINGS OUTSIDE OF MY CONTROL. THIS JOB HAS A WAY OF HUMBLING YOU. I SAW THINGS I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SEE AND IT BROKE ME. BUT THE FUNNY THING ABOUT BROKENNESS IS THAT IT CAN EITHER LEAD YOU TO FAITH OR AWAY FROM IT. I'VE BEEN THE SHERIFF HERE FOR 30 YEARS. I'VE SEEN THE WORST MAN CAN DO AND I'VE SEEN THE BEST. THIS IS THE HOME OF THE INTERNET CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN OR THE ICAC AS WE CALL IT. FOLKS ARE SURPRISED WHEN THEY HEAR THAT WE'RE IN THIS TOWN. I SUPPOSE IT'S GRACE THAT ENABLES US TO KEEP OUR FAITH AT ALL. IT'S A CHOICE WE MAKE. SOME PEOPLE SEEM TO BE GOING AWAY, NOT COMING CLOSER. LOSING INSTEAD OF FINDING. NOT THAT I CAN ENTIRELY BLAME THEM. BECAUSE WHEN YOU'VE SEEN THE THINGS WE SEE, FAITH CAN SEEM LIKE A FRAGILE THING. AND THERE WILL COME A TIME WHEN YOU FEEL OVERWHELMINGLY HELPLESS, AND THE ONLY THING LEFT TO DO IS PRAY. CAN GOOD ACTUALLY COME FROM EVIL? I DIDN'T THINK SO, BUT GOD THINKS DIFFERENTLY. [CAR APPROACHING] - HEY THERE, SWEETHEART. YOU HERE ALONE? - JUST ME AND SUNSHINE. - HOW OLD ARE YOU? - WELL, HOW OLD DO YOU THINK I AM? - YOU LOOK, UH... YOU LOOK A LITTLE OLDER THAN 13. - 13?

GET THIS, WHAT MAN USES AND INTENDS FOR EVIL, GOD ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS USES FOR GOOD. SO HERE'S MY QUESTION. ARE YOU TRUSTING GOD OR ARE YOU TRUSTING SOMEONE ELSE? ONE OF THE HARDEST THINGS THAT ELIZABETH AND I HAVE EVER GONE THROUGH IS WHEN WE FOUND OUT THAT WE COULDN'T HAVE CHILDREN. BUT THE THING THAT WE DID THROUGH ALL OF IT IS THAT WE COMPLETELY LET GOD HAVE CONTROL OVER THE SITUATION. AND HERE, FOUR YEARS REMOVED FROM THAT VERY MOMENT IN THE LIFE OF OUR MARRIAGE, WE BELIEVE IT IS SO INCREDIBLY TRUE, NOT ONLY FOR US BUT ALSO FOR YOU. - QUIXOTRY. - WAIT A SECOND, WHAT?

I'VE SEEN THE WORST MAN CAN DO, AND I'VE SEEN THE BEST. I SUPPOSE IT'S GRACE THAT ENABLES US TO KEEP OUR FAITH AT ALL. "THE LORD SHOULD BE PRAISED. I CALLED ON HIM, AND I WAS SAVED FROM MY ENEMIES. THE ROPES OF DEATH HAD BECOME TANGLED AROUND ME. THE TORRENTS OF DESTRUCTION HAD OVERWHELMED ME. THE ROPES OF THE GRAVE HAD SURROUNDED ME. THE CLUTCHES OF DEATH HAD CONFRONTED ME. I CALLED ON THE LORD IN MY DISTRESS. I CRIED TO MY GOD FOR HELP. HE HEARD MY VOICE FROM HIS TEMPLE, AND MY CRY FOR HELP REACHED HIS EARS." PSALM 18. [APPLAUSE] - TODAY, WE ARE PRIVILEGED AND HONORED. AS YOU KNOW, IN OUR CHURCH, FAITH WAS ABDUCTED NOT LONG AGO. YOU KNOW THE STORY, THREE DAYS HELD CAPTIVE AND RESCUED BY THE POLICE, AND HER OWN DAD, IT WAS AN INCREDIBLE STORY THERE. AND YOU KNOW, THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT SOMETIMES THINGS THAT ARE MEANT FOR EVIL, GOD MEANS FOR GOOD. ALSO RESCUED IN THE MIDST OF THAT WAS THIS BEAUTIFUL CHILD BOBBY. AND MATT AND ELIZABETH, I KNOW THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT, SO TODAY WE GET TO DEDICATE BOBBY INTO YOUR ARMS AND INTO YOUR HANDS AS YOUR CHILD. AND SO LET'S HAVE A WORD OF PRAYER RIGHT NOW. GOD, TODAY WE DEDICATE BOBBY. LORD, WE THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS SWEET CHILD INTO MATT AND INTO ELIZABETH'S ARMS, GOD THAT YOU WOULD BLESS THEM IN A POWERFUL WAY...
