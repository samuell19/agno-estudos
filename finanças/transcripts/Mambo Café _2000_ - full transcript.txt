[music playing] -How's the soup? -The soup is excellent. -You're a good man, Frank. One day I'm going to pay you back for everything with interest. -I'm going to mention this place to all my friends. -Do me a favor. Let's just keep it between us. [music playing] -Mambo Cafe. Look, I told you already, the check is in the mail. How am I supposed to pay you if you keep calling me all the time? I don't have time for this. This is a very busy place. I have a lot of hungry customers hollering at me. They're hungry, they need me to feed them. -Hey, am I going to get any service over here? I want that special. And a side of rice and beans. -And give me an order of that steak fillet with extra vegetables. Another double order-- -Look, call me later, in three days, if you haven't gotten it yet, OK? Bye. -I think we should talk again about what I said yesterday. -Look, I told you I don't want to have no more talking about going back to Puerto Rico. Why is it that every time a Puerto Rican has a little problem over here, they take a $99 flight back to Puerto Rico? They have a problem over there? They take another $99 flight back to the States. Did you ever see the Greeks or the Jews or the Italians running back and forth every time things got a little tough? No. It was too and it was too expensive. So they planted their feet in America, and that's why they made it. Sometimes I think the biggest problem we Puerto Rican have is those damn $99 fares. -You want to know what I think is the biggest problem we have? -Not really. -It's hard-headed men like you who are too stubborn to realize that it's better to struggle on a beautiful tropical island than in some ghetto in the United States. -I told you a hundred times already. The only way I'm going back to Puerto Rico is as a success or in a pine box. -Well you better make it pretty quick because in another week all we're going to be able to afford is cardboard. -Oh, hi, Ma. How you doin', Pop? -Hey. Pull up those pants. What have you got there? -What? What, nothing. A radio. -You little thief! We didn't spend 15 years feeding and clothings you so you could go and steal car radios. -I didn't steal it, Ma, all right? I bought it off for 10 bucks and tomorrow I'll sell it for 25. -Now you see? Is that what you want to stay here, so we can raise the future star of "America's Most Wanted"? FRANK: What are you getting so upset about? He just told you you he didn't steal it. You know, that's the way things are done here. You know, you buy low and you tell high. -Oh to hell with your high and your low. Frank, I want that piece of junk out of here. -Hey, Ricky, I'll give you $12.50 for it. -Come on, Pop, what do you want it for? You don't even have a car anymore. -Hey it's not like I'm going to be without a car the rest of my life. Soon as this place turns around, the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to buy my old Chevy back. Look, you see? You see the kind of clientele this place can attract? Huh? Welcome to our restaurant. Would you prefer a window table? -Hi, Dad. It's me. -Nydia! -Hi, Ricky. Hi, Mom. -What did you do to your hair? -I dyed it, do you like it? We brought you back from Puerto Rico so you could get an American education, not so you could turn into Marilyn Monroe, Nydia. -Oh, Ma. Stop being so dramatic. Everybody's doing this. -Who cares what color her hair is? The important thing is she's back home with us. Now we can go to the movies and go ice skating at Rockefeller Center. -Oh no, I'm sorry, Daddy, I'm only here for a few days. Listen. I met this guy. He's a medical student at Harvard University, and he wants me to meet his parents on the Cape. -The Cape. -It's just this place where they have a vacation-- -We know where the Cape is, all right? You always talk to us like we're a bunch of bumpkins. -Well in your case, that would be about eight steps up. -Yeah well you're the one that sounds like you just got off some banana boat. Look I gotta get out of here, I think my stomach is going to be fixed. -You take that radio and you get the $10 back, you hear me, Ricky? -Listen, I promised Chris I'd call him. We'll talk some more later, OK? You look beautiful. Oh, Daddy, everything has gotten so expensive up there. I'm going to need another $2,000 when I leave, OK? -$2,000? Did she that? Where am I going to get $2,000? -You're asking me? You're the one who created little Ms. Frankenstein by never telling her what is really going on around here, Frank. -What's so wrong with that, huh? I want her to grow up without worrying about money and I want her to grow up with confidence. You know, in one more year she's going to be the only member of either of our families to have graduated from college. -That's great, she'll be the first college graduate, and I'll be the first one in my family that ever has to go on welfare, right? -Nobody's going on welfare in this family, OK? MANNY: I could get you 22 of these, all right? Blue, green, or maroon? -What about gray? You know, my wife, she likes gray. -You don't want gray. Take a look around, huh? See any gray around here? These are tropical people. We're talking maroon, we're talking green like vegetation. Blue, like the sky or the ocean. When I got you all those suitcases and you couldn't move them all, huh? Didn't I take the rest of them back? You're going to have to trust me on this. You're going to take 22 of these. I guarantee you're moving them out of here in four weeks, tops. I'll even throw in a gray suit, free of charge all right, so you can wear it around the house and make your wife happy. -Double breasted. My wife, she likes double breasted. -I'll see what I can do, OK? You think the two of these on consignment, we'll settle up when I bring the rest in a couple days. [speaking spanish] -Got the radios here, radios right here, c'mon. Let's go, ladies and gentlemen, we got radios here. $40, all sales are final. Radios, radios, radios. Radios are right here, radios are right here. Let's go. Ladies and gentlemen. Radios, radios. -What are you guys doing? -Man, we're trying to get paid. -You best show some respect. Relax. Hey, do you want a radio? -No, forget about it. You know Manny only goes legit. -Right, right. -Yeah, you know what? I bet you pay all sorts of taxes for that stuff you get over in the Garment District. -Yeah, I pay taxes all right, and you guys are going to get yourselves busted. -No one's going to get busted. Man, just yesterday, I sold a cop a blown one for $50, man. Come on. -Let me see that. All right, I'll give you $20 for it. -Nah, just forget about it, all right? Why don't you just go to Macy's and pay $200, that way you can get yourself a warranty and everything? -All right. Here's your $40. -This is-- -You better explain to these coconut-eaten punks who runs this neighborhood. -Now listen. You little punks are going to have to learn early that you don't do nothing in this neighborhood without giving me my cut, eh? Capisce? I'll blind you, I'll blind you, you do that again you little-- -C'mon, you know better. -Y'all can't be doing that shit. How come you don't have to pay him? -Put it down. Put it down, Loco. -Everybody pays him. Come here. I got to talk to you. -Damn. MANNY: Look, Ricky, I want you to forget about that guy, OK? His days are numbered anyway. -What do you mean? -Hey, he's been skimming off some fence, they think. Word on the street is that they're going to put the hit on him any day now. Maybe you should introduce me to these guys, because I hit that fat pig myself. Ricky. I wrote your sister a couple times, she hasn't answered me. You heard anything from her? -Hey look, Manny. You're all right, you're always looking out for me and everything, so I'm going to do you a solid. You don't want any of that anymore. -Why? -Because she's buggin', that's why. You should see her, man. I think they short-circuited her up in that college or something. -When did you see her? You went to Boston? -Nah, man, she's home. Look, I got to get back before they think I split on them. I'll catch you later. -Yeah, OK. All right. -Listen. I talked to Chris and he said his family is really looking forward to meeting me. -Yeah, how about us? When do we get to me him? -Um, uh, sure, I'll see if I can work something out. I can't believe you guys are still buying this stuff. Don't you have any arugula? -Arugula what? -Or romaine, even? Look at this. I can't make the salad from this. I'm going to have to go out. See you later. -How long did she say she's going to be here? -No, maybe she's right. Maybe that's what's wrong. Maybe it's time we started to learn something from our children. -Oh, yeah. I'm sure we could learn something from them. From this one, we could learn how to hotwire a car in two seconds flat. -What, I was just hoping el Loco's mother put a gate on her kitchen window, all right? -Look. Wash up, go down to Gilberto's, pick up some eggs, a couple of frozen chickens. See if he can give you a couple of those six-packs of pork chops and tell him we'll pay him next week, huh? -Come on Pop, I don't want to go back over there, he says you already owe him a bunch of money. -Never mind, I'll go over there later and do it myself. -I'll go, OK? -Oh no, don't do me any favors. You would think I'm the only one around here who remembers that a family is supposed to help each other! -I said I'd go. NEWS ANCHOR (ON TV): Ongoing coverage of the local mafia. NEWS ANCHOR 2 (ON TV): As is usually the case with mob hits, the police are having difficulty with locating any witnesses from yesterday's mid-afternoon slaying of Anthony "The Gimp" Delatone. The But while police may be having difficulty locating witnesses this small and previously unknown restaurant is now having no trouble locating clientele. Sir, I understand that you and your wife are here in New York celebrating your 50th wedding anniversary, and have been waiting for a table for close to two hours. Why did you choose this particular restaurant? MAN (ON TV):What, are you kidding? We're from Omaha. You know, the most-- -Look at all those people. NEWS ANCHOR 2 (ON TV): Why are you here? MAN (ON TV): Well, if you want to know something, I must have driven past this place over a thousand times just this week alone, and never once did I think about going inside. But these guys-- and I think we all know who we're talking about-- if they come in here to eat, you'd better believe this place has got one hell of a kitchen. -Look at that. Everything time one of these Mobsters gets hit in a restaurant, it's like the restaurant hit the lottery. -I know someone that's about to get hit. -What? -What? -What are you talking about? -Yeah. -I know this fat Mafia guy that's about to get wiped any day now. -You see? I hope you're listening to this. Go ahead and listen to your 15 year-old son talking about somebody getting wiped. -Look, the guy's a goner anyway. Look all I'm saying is that if he got hit wiped in here, we'd be doing business just like that place on TV. And why you giving me a hard time? It was Pop that said it. -Hey, hey, hey. That was just talk, all right? Nobody expected you to have a plan all worked out. And how do you know about these things, anyways? Huh? -Everybody knows. It's all over the street. -Well maybe you should spend more time at home and less time in the street. You're grounded for two days. -What? -Yeah! -Nydia! Nydia. -Manny, god. You scared the hell out of me, you know? -I went by the restaurant. Your mother said you want out to get something to eat and I thought you might come by here. Remember when we used to eat here all the time? -Yeah. That was a long time ago, Manny. -So how long are you here for? -Just for a couple of days. I have to get back and prepare some stuff for school. -I-- I wrote you a couple of times. Um. How come you didn't answer me? -Manny. I was going to call you today and-- -So, you go back when? Tomorrow? -No, no, no, no, the following day, but listen. This is important. -I have to go downtown to pick up some stuff but maybe, um, maybe we can get together later. Do some dinner, catch a movie or something. -For tonight? I can't. I'm spending time with my family. Can we just talk on the phone? -Um. Yeah, yeah, sure. -Look, I have to go. I'll call you. -I like your hair like that. -Oh, my-- [chuckles] Thank you. [pounding noise] -The hell is that? -I don't know. Go see. [pounding] -Stay here. [pounding] -Hey, what a nice surprise. -Open up, Frank. It's deadbeat clean up day. -What are you talking about? I thought you said I had three more weeks! -Correction-- you said you had three more weeks. Open them up. -All right! Wait, wait, wait a minute! Wait! All right, yeah, yeah. Yeah, come on in and sit down. Listen, I-- I'll brew us a cup of coffee. I'm sure we can work something out! -Thanks, we all ready had our coffee. This ain't nothing personal. You people are just going to have to learn how to carry your own weight. -Hey, we carry our weight. And you people better get the hell out of here before I beat the crap out you! -Hey! How many times I got to tell you I don't want you talking like that. Now go upstairs, Ricky! -Don't forget the corner tables. -What's going on here? -We're behind on the payments. -Still, you can't just come in here and clean out the restaurant. -These are my tables, lady. I'll do whatever the hell I want. -Do you have papers? -Yeah. I have papers-- about six bounced checks. -You've obviously never heard of a writ of habeas corpus. -A writ of what? What is that? Puerto Rican for dead beats? -It's a legal term. And what it means is that once credit has been granted in any amount of down payment, or monthly payments has been made towards the purchase of the merchandise, that the person making those payments is a legal partial owner of the merchandise. And that the creditor must first petition the court before repossession is allowed. -Oh, really? -That's right. Do you have even one receipt of payments for these tables? -I have a bunch of them. Here. -What you're doing here, whatever your name is, is illegal. I can get on that phone right now and have you charged with forcible entry and harassment. And by the time you're finished paying your court costs, you're going to wish you gave him those tables for free. -Yeah. She's, uh, studying business at Boston University, huh? Pretty good, huh? -By the way, the prosecutor's office love it when these kind of charges are made. Because whether the complaints stick or not, it's an excuse to look through your books. So I just hope you have everything in order. -You got three weeks and that's it. RICKY: Hey, it's nothing personal. You people are just going to have to get your shit together before you come half stepping into this place. -How many times I got to tell you stop talking like that? -So what do you think of an American education now, huh? -No, this whole thing is embarrassing, Daddy. The only good thing is that everyone in this neighborhood is still asleep. I don't understand how you let things get like this. -It's easy. You just write a check and there's no money in the bank. What's so hard to understand about that? -You should at least be making partial payments, Mom. I'll take a look at the books later. -What's the matter with her? I thought going to college it was supposed to make you smart. Didn't she hear me say there's no money in the bank? -Next the stove and refrigerator guys are going to show up. And they're not going to want to hear anything about no Corpus Christi stuff. That'll be it. Come on down here. We're going to have a family meeting. -What are you doing? -Now we've had this place for, what? Five? -Six. -Six years. Most of the time it's been pretty good. Now things have changed. Now hardly nobody from around here can afford too go out to a restaurant. So we've got think of something to attract people outside this neighborhood. People who can still afford to go out. -First of all, the kind of people you're talking about are not going to come over here to eat beef and pig ears. People are more health conscious now. -I really appreciate what you did with the table guy. But this is a Puerto Rican restaurant and neither your mother nor me know anything about arugula or Romaine lettuces, OK? And another thing. Up to now, your mother and I, we've been doing pretty good around here. And just because you went to college doesn't give you no right to treat us like some campesinos from the mountains. -That's not what I meant-- -Look, I have an idea. Or should I say Ricky has an idea. -I-- I want you all to know that this isn't something that I would be thinking if there was any other choice. I think that we should do what Ricky suggested yesterday. -Oh my god, Frank! What are you thinking? Have you completely lost your mind? -Way to go, Dad. -What? What's he talking about? -He wants something fat Mafia guy Ricky knows to come over here so they can kill him. So we can have more business like this guy in the newspaper. -I'm not talking about killing a guy. There's already a contract out on him. We don't have to lift a finger. Only thing we've got to do is make sure that the guys in the restaurant when he gets it. Then our troubles will be over. -This is not the way people do business, Dad. You go out, you get a loan application, and you take it to a bank. -Oh. You want to see a loan application? Is that what you want to see? OK. You want to see loan applications. I have them here. Look. I have one here, I have another one, I got two more of them right here. You see this bank right here? This bank has thrown me out of it so many times that every time I go down there, and they see me coming, they send a flunky to tell me that the guy's not in his office. -What about a personal loan? -Well if you know somebody, tell me. Because all the people I know, they're asking me for money. -What about those bonds you bought that time? -They're gone a long time ago. NYDIA: This is crazy business. I absolutely refuse to get involved with something like this. -OK. But before we put this matter to rest, I think it's only fair that I should tell you that if this restaurant doesn't start making money soon, then I don't think you can go back to school. -What do you mean? Are you trying to say there's no money? I thought you always put my tuition money aside. -We did. But we had to put it back inside. How do you think we've been paying rent around here? I'm sorry. That's the way it is. If we can't make this restaurant work then everything ends. Including your school. I guess that's it, huh? -Wait a minute, let me get this straight. So this is a really, really bad man who maims and kills people? And did you say there was all ready a contract out on this guy? CARMEN: Oh my god! What are you doing? What does school matter if we all end up with prison numbers on our back? -Ma, stop being so dramatic. It's not like we're killing the guy. So have you figured out how you're going to get him in here? -So you want me to help you do what? RICKY: Look, you know how these guys are. You know I can't just walk up and invite them to the restaurant by myself. Just take me over there. -No. Forget it. Right? Those guys are wacko. And the best thing you could do is to stay as far away as possible. -Look, I don't know what you're so worried about, OK? The guy's a goner. I mean what's he going to do, kill you from the grave? -It's not just him I'm worried about, OK? These guys don't like outsiders messing around in the business. I'm sorry I ever told you anything. -You know what, let's just forget it. I'll find somebody else to help me. -That's I'm saying. Look, you can't just go around telling people your gonna do this! You're gonna end up gettin' wasted. Ricky! -Let me do the talking, OK? -You better keep that friggin' thing in your pants and get back to work, or we're gonna be collecting you from the bottom of a dumpster. You get my drift. -Hey, Tony. -Get outta here. -How you guys doin'? -Hey, you remember Ricky from the other day, right? -Yeah, how you doin'? -Oh, yeah, yeah, the little scumbag who goes around ripping off car radi-- -Ooh! -You see this car? If I see as much as a hubcap missing, I'm gonna save this city money by sweeping the streets with the back of your head. -Come on, Tony, look he's a kid. All right, he wants to apologize for being such a wise ass the other day. -Yeah, that's right. I just want to apologize. I didn't know who you were. -Well, now you do. Get lost. -Listen, Tony, his family is still worried your mad at 'em. You know. And they want to make it up to you by inviting you to dinner at their restaurant. -Yeah, that's right. We want to invite you to a nice dinner. -What are they kidding? Why would I want to go out and eat of bowl of that Spic food? I'd be fartin' all day. -Hey, ah, Tony, you ever see my family? -Yous all look alike anyway. -That's my mother. My father, me, and that right there is my sister. I just thought maybe you seen them around or something. -No, no, no, I can honestly say that I haven't, because believe me, garbanzos like that, I would'a remembered. He he. So where is this shit house? -Right on Second Avenue. You can't miss it. -We'll be there at 6:00. -We were thinking about tomorrow! -Ricky, do you remember if your mother put wine on the pork chops? -Yeah. I think so. -Dad, what are you doing? -You could have at least tried to make this for tomorrow. -Hey, it's not like he gave me a lot of choices. -Well, there's no way this is going to be ready in time. Hey, are you gonna give me a hand or not? -I told you I'm staying out of this. Maybe the judge will have mercy on me. -Pass me the sauce. -Oh! Damn! -I think that's gonna need a bit more water. -OK! Both of you get out of here before there's nothing left of this restaurant to save. Nydia, get down here and give me a hand with this. -Yeah. I know, Chris. I'm really very sorry. This has been happening to Mother ever since Father died in that boating accident. She'll be doing fine, then without the least bit of warning, she'll suffer another relapse. I know. If you could just extend my apologies to your parents. This relapse is usually last a couple of days. And I'll leave Argentina as soon as I feel she is doing better. -Nydia! Nydia! Nydia! -I'll call you in a couple of days. Love. I miss you too. Kisses. What! I'm coming! Jesus Christ, can anybody even make a phone call around here? -Nydia, do you know if these people like a lot of cilantro or a little cilantro in their food? -How am I supposed to know, Mom? Why don't you ask the street expert over here? Speaking of street experts, does anybody know how it's supposed to happen? -How, what's supposed to happen? -You know, the thing. The hit. Whatever you want to call it. I mean, are they just going to throw a bomb in here, and blow us all to smithereens? That would really defeat the purpose of this whole thing, wouldn't it? -I don't know. They'll probably do it like in "The Godfather." Pacino just walked up to that crooked captain and pow! A .45 slug right through the head. -What's that other movie? Uh uh, Nice Fellows? -You mean "Goodfellas." -Yeah. Yeah, remember they get a piece of wire. They wrap it around the guy's neck, and they strangle him to death. -[spanish] "Goodfellas." I just can't believe you two waited till the last minute to talk about this stuff. -Hey, we talking about it now, all right? Because it might even be a drive by like they did that guy on TV. Oh, we have to make sure we don't get hit by any stray bullets. -Oh my God! That's it, Frank. I can't do this. -I think it's a little late for that, Ma. -Oh, whoa, open up over here. Are they here or what? -Oh my God. They're disgusting. --[spanish] And there's three of 'em. [speaking spanish] -We don't have enough food to feed them, Frank. -Well, we'll just put a lot of bread on the table. And we gotta make sure that they get clear shot at him. And if Ricky's right, and it's a drive-by, whenever you see a slow-moving vehicle in front of the restaurant, just get as far away from it as possible. OK? Don't be nervous. -Hey, I'm glad we made a reservation. -Good. And uh, hello, I'm Frank, uh, Ricky's father. Welcome to the restaurant. Uh, it's truly an honor to have you here. -Yeah, well you should be honored. Cause it's the first time I ever ate any of this mira-mira food. -Mira-mira food. Ha, ha, ha. Mira-mira food. That's very funny. -What the hell does this here mean? What, Nydia's cutlets? -Oh, no, no. That, that's the house specialty. That's Nydia's chuletas. That means Nydia's pork chops. I named that special after my daughter, Nydia. -Oh, well, I can see why. So, uh, allow me introduce myself. I'm Antonio Andolucci, and I gotta say, it's an absolute pleasure to make your acquaintance. -Uh, nice to meet you. -Eh, so, Lydia-- -Nydia. -Whatever. When am I gonna be able to taste them fabulous pork chops of yours? -I don't care who the hell you are mister, but [speaking spanish] -You have to excuse my children. You know how kids are today. That's why I want to apologize to you personally. -Oh, it's all right, Pancho. I like frisky women. -Come on this way. I have a table. This way. Come, come, come. I have a table for you. Over here. Over here. We have a special table for you. Excuse me. Excuse me. Get down. Get down. -They got something. -I forgot the wine. -Ah, these Puerto Ricans are the weirdest people I ever seen. -The wine. -Hey, Pop. Isn't that the table where the plastic keeps falling from the ceiling? -Yeah, yeah. That's right. You know, I've been meaning to fix that. -There's no plaster on the ceiling. What plaster? -Well, you see. OK. To be honest with you, the reason I want to sit over here is because it's not every day I get a man of your importance eating at my restaurant. And I'd like to show you off a little, you see. We think it, we think it'll be good for business. You understand. -Ah, well, heh, if there's one thing I understand, believe me, it's business. And speaking of business, how come you ain't paying us no protection? -Protection? -Yeah, protection. Things can get nasty around here. Arms can be broken. Heads can be split. A capisce? Put 'em down for $75 a week. -You got it, boss. -Ma, oh the mother's got even better garbanzos than the daughter. -Not a bad ass either. -[speaking spanish] -What's she saying? -She's just upset because she couldn't find bigger pork chops to prepare for you. Uh, she's very emotional about her cooking. -[speaking spanish] -You'd better how to take care of your woman, pal. -She feels that she's too hard on herself. She doesn't feel she's done a good job. -What is this shit? -Oh, this is the special. The chuletas with the side of tostones. -Tostones? Ain't that pigs' balls? -No, no, no, no. No, no. That's cojones. Cojones. That is just fried banana. Try it. You'll like it. -This shit ain't half bad. Oh, come on, hit the park, would ya? Get out of here. Hey, geez, leave something. Will ya. You eat like you're going to the-- Geez, save me a pork chop, for Christ. Eat every one of them there? Come on. Ya get it all over your shirt. You sure this is pork, Pancho? I've seen some cats running around. -[flatulence] -Oh yeah. That was-- Come on. Something crawl up and die inside him? -[burping] -Look at this shit. Oh, mm. Mm. Oh. My, that was delicious. -[burping] -Got any more pork? Put some there. Oh they got more meat. What are you wasting the meat for? -What about dessert, boss? -Nah. You're gonna wanna go downtown. Go down to Coney Island, get some hot dogs. All right, come on. Let's go. Oh, boy. All right. So listen, hey Pancho. Delicious stuff. Make sure tomorrow you got more of this, uh, tostone shit over here. It's fantastic! All right? See ya' then pork chops. Tomorrow. All right? Same time, same station. See ya' tomorrow night. -Are you sure you want to do this, Mom? -Those animals have been coming back every single day, Nydia. What are we supposed to feed them with? -Hi. -What can I do you for? -How much will you give me for this? That ring has been in our family for three generations. -You never told me that. -It was your grandmother Josefina's ring. If she knew what I was going to use it for, she'd probably turn over in her grave. -Here, take this instead. -What are you doing? -Chris gave me those, Ma. We'll get them out later. -Are you sure? -It's OK, Mom. Don't worry about it. -Ha, ha, ha, ha. -[flatulence] -You, boss, you want me to break the China man's legs? -You break his legs, we don't get the money. Do whatever in the hell you want. -Are you sure there's a contract out on this guy? -Yeah. I even had Ricky double-check with Manny yesterday just to make sure. -Ya' know, Hey Pancho. Next time bring us the good shit, will ya'? Bring us some more of that yucca shit. Ah oh. Not you. We didn't come here to waited on by some loser. Let pork chop bring it over. -Dear God! What is this nightmare? -You. Front and center. Get outta there. Arriba! -Come on. Arriba! -These are unquestionably one of the finest set of pork chops I seen in my life. You see this yucca shit? It's nuttin' compared to a nice, sweet, ripe coconut like that. Come on. Here, here. Here mira. Come here mira. Come on mira, mira, mira. Ya' know the only trouble is that you're not Italian, and that means all we could do is have hot, sweaty, steaming, dumping till we crap kind of sex on the side. -Sorry. But we're all out of hot, steamy, thumping sex right now. Maybe we can offer you another vat of fries instead. -You gonna let her get away with that? -Hey! Why don't you keep your fat, disgusting little hands to yourself? [speaking spanish] -I love these hot-tempered PR women. -Wait, wait. What are you doing? -I'm gonna go kill that son-of-a-bitch myself. -What are you, crazy? -Hey, didn't you people say you had some soup for us? What's goin' on? -Soup? I'll give him soup. -Give me that soup! Where are you going? -Get the hell out of the way, Frank. I wanna give that son-of-a-bitch the soup. -Hey! Tony wants his soup. -Ah, yeah, yeah, We know. We're just gettin' it ready right now. Give me that soup. -Um, you can't, Frank. -Is there some kind of problem here? -Oh no, no, no, no. She just thought it might need to simmer a little longer. -Just let it simmer on the table, huh? And get some bowls. -Frank, you can't give them the soup. -What are you, crazy? -No, but-- -Soup's up, boss. Ah, it smells good. -Hurry up, I'm starving. -Let me ask you a question, Frank. How much you and your scumbag son make for messing up other peoples' cars? -Oh we don't do any. -Don't give me any of your crap. Huh? I know you got a thing going. After I finish it, we're gonna figure out some additional payments for you. Now get the hell outta here. -I'll get you something to pour it in. -Give me a chance. -Come on, with this. Ah. -[slurp] -[gasp] -[gasp] -[gasp] -[gasp] -Holy shit. They finally got that spice right. -Ha, ha, ha, ha. -Get the hell outta here. I told you I wanted your daughter to take care of me. -It'll be a cold day in hell before I ever serve you again you fuck disgusting pig. -Shh. -What'd she say? -[speaking spanish] -She didn't mean that. -I'm going to try to say this as politely as possible. Why don't you just get the hell out of here, and take those two pigs with you. -All right, that's it. [shouting] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [car driving off] -Is he dead? -He's a goner all right. -Son-of-a-bitch! What happened? Which way did they go? -They all beat it. -That way. That way! -Let's get outta here. Come on. Come on, let's get outta here. -We're standing in front of Mambo Cafe, a Puerto Rican in Spanish Harlem where the on-going feud between two local mafia families has just claimed victim number five. And with us we have Frank Benitez, the restaurant's owner who was at the scene when the hit occurred. Mr. Benitez, could you describe what you saw? -Well, like I told the police already, it all happened so fast. Uh, I heard a shot-- a bang, bang-- and I turned around real fast, and I saw this guy laying on the floor of my restaurant, the Mambo Cafe. Take the four, or the five, or the six. We're on the corner of 108th and 2nd Avenue. We're open for lunch. -So what you're saying is that although you had just finished serving the deceased when the drive-by occurred, you were unable to get a good look at either the assailant or their vehicle as it fled the scene? -Yes, uh, these guys were fast. All I heard was the tires screeching as they fled the Mambo Cafe. Uh, take the 4, or the 5, or the 6. Our phone number is 555-1445, and all kids under two months old eat for free. -I don't understand it. A guy got hit at what? 5:00? -6:00. -OK, 6:00. And then you got the news at 7:00 and 11:00. So don't you think that by now some of the people coming home from work would be a little curious about where that guy got hit? -Maybe we ought to give people more credit. -Man! I'm jinxed is what it is. That's it, you know. I have no more ideas. Go ahead. Call your brother. Tell him he was right all along. Tell them what a big disappointment I turned out to be, and that if he'll put us up I, I promise to keep my head down whenever he walks into the room. -I don't understand why you always gotta be comparing yourself to my brother for. At least you tried to do something. You worked your way up from a dishwasher, and you opened up your own restaurant. And you put your daughter through three years of college. How many people do we know over there who can say that? -You really mean that? -I said it didn't I? [knocking] -Gilberto, I don't have the money. OK? I'm working on getting you the money. OK? -No. Listen, Frank. I heard about what happened. And with all the news coverage and everything. And I figured you're going to be needing a lot more groceries from now on. Anything you need-- and I mean anything-- you just come to my store. Is that OK? -Well, thanks. But you know, with my luck, news coverage or no news coverage, everything's the same around here. Look, I think somebody put the brujeria on me. I'm going to go back to Puerto Rico. I'll try to send you the money from over there. OK? -What are you talking about? Look. -We made it! We made it! Carmen, we made it! We did it! Oh, thank God. We did it! -What did you do? -We've got customers! We've got customers! Go check the window. Just watch, over there. CARMEN: Oh my god! They're lined up and down the street! -Tell Ricky and Nydia to come down here. We're going to need some help. Ah! CARMEN: Ricky, hurry up. Go look, there's customers! -We did it! We got customers! -[squeal] -Nydia. Nydia, go upstairs, get your clothes on and bring your papa's pants down. -People are getting inpatient out there. -Well, just let 'em in. -What are you crazy! We're not ready. -That's OK. I just want to see people in the restaurant for a change. Come on in! -I want the table where he was sitting when he got hit. -He was right here! [talking excitedly] -He was right here! He was over here! Right here. He was right here! And right here too. He stumbled. He got shot over here. He went here. He went here. He was a big, fat, disgusting guy. -Give me what he had before they did him in. -I'm telling you everybody! He was a big, fat, disgusting criminal. He was all over this restaurant. Give me my pants. -Chris. Chris I have some very good news. Mother's doing much, much better. And I think I'll be able to leave Argentina in a couple of days. Isn't that just wonderful? The doctor is assigning a nurse to stay with my mother for the next few weeks. He feels the chances of her having another stroke are minimal. Even mother feels there is no need for me to stay. Yeah, she really is just wonderful. [giggles] Ma, since the restaurant is doing much better now, can I have some money to get my hair touched up? I mean, look at this. -Nydia, you have such beautiful hair. Why don't you just get one of those short haircuts until it grows back out. -'Cause I like it this way. So do we have any extra money or not? -Nydia? -Hm? -Is there anything you want to tell me? -Like what? -I don't know like do I have any terrible diseases I don't know anything about? -What are you talking about? -I'm talking about me having relapses, and needing nurses, and you having to leave Argentina. When the hell were you ever in Argentina, Nydia? -I can't believe this. You've been spying on me? -Hey, don't try and turn this thing around. OK? 'Cause I was innocently walking to my room when I heard some person I didn't know talking on your telephone. Nydia, I'm going to say this once. You better start telling me what's going on, because I swear, money or no money, you're not going back to that Boston University. -You want me to tell you what's going on? -Yeah! -Fine, I'll tell you all right. I'll tell you. I met Chris at a party at Harvard. His father is one of the top surgeons in Boston. His uncle is also a doctor who teaches at Harvard Medical School. First, I told one little lie to cover my stupid accent. And then I had to tell another lie to cover the first one. And anyway, I'm sure you know how the rest goes. By the end of two drinks, he thinks I'm wealthy. And then when Dad said I couldn't go to the Cape to meet his parents, I had to make up this thing about having to go home because you were sick and now we're staying in Argentina. Mom, you have no idea what it's like out there. You don't know how many times I've met guys up there, and when I tell them I'm Puerto Rican, sooner or later they get around to asking if I grew up on welfare, and if I have any relatives in jail. And I'm not just talking about the students, either. Even the professors treat you like you're from Mars or something. I just get a little bored with being on display all the time, OK? -I never realized going to go college could be so traumatic, Nydia. Maybe I ought to take your tuition and send you to a psychiatrist instead. -See? That's just what I'm talking about. There's just no way you're going to understand, mom. -I heard you say that I was over my stroke, and that you were leaving Argentina. Does that mean you're going to the Cape? -Well, it seems the restaurant is doing much better now. -Hey, I thought you were studying business over there. This place has been practically empty for almost a year. What do you think? Our problems are suddenly over? We can't afford to hire somebody! We need you here to at least help us wait on the tables! [spanish] Come here. Come here. I want to show you something really special. Look at this. Your father went out yesterday and he put this on credit, just so you could have something nice to wear when you're working in the restaurant. And I know it's not exactly something you would pick out for yourself. But he's jumping up and down because he thinks you're spending the holidays with us. And as much as he sacrificed to put you through college, the least you can do is call this rich boyfriend of yours and tell him I had another relapse. And another thing, I may just be some jibaro that went straight from Puerto Rico to Spanish Harlem, but it seems to me that if this guy was worth anything more than just money, he would appreciate you a million times more for who you really are and what it is you're trying to accomplish. Instead of going around trying to build a relationship based on one of the biggest whoppers I ever heard, Nydia. -Chris is not like that, Mom. Any day now I'm going to tell him the truth. I just need a little more time so-- so he can get to know me better. That's all! -Boo. -Oh, Manny. -You know, you should let Ricky help you with this stuff. -He's busy helping Frank at the restaurant. We're doing a little better now, you know. -I heard. -So Manny, what's a matter for you? All of a sudden you're too good to come to the restaurant anymore? -Not at all. You know how it is. Sometimes you get busy. And before you know it, you don't even have time to visit your favorite people. -So you should come anyway. And don't worry about Nydia. You know, she's just a little confused right now. -I don't know. She seemed pretty clear to me. -You talk to her? -Yeah, yeah. We talked on the phone. Mostly I just listened. -She told you about Harvard. -Yeah. And, uh, who's gonna compete with that, right? -Hmm. -Listen, I-- I gotta go finish something up. Are you gonna be OK? -Oh my god, I don't believe it. You know, this is exactly what I've been looking for. But how am I gonna get this big thing back to the restaurant with all these bags and everything? [speaking spanish] -Ma,where you been? You see that crowd out there? -Manny had to help me pick up some things. Put them over there, would you, Manny. Nydia! Nydia! -Hey Manny, come here. Check this out. So what do you think? -I don't think the feet are supposed to have toes. -Oh yeah. Yeah, maybe you're right. -Hey, hey, Manny! -Hey, Frank. -Pretty exciting, huh? Look at the size of that guy. Yesterday we had three tourists that came here and laid down to take pictures. There was still room for one more! I think whoever did this was a really bad shot because that bullet richocheted all over the place before it got him. Look, there's a bullet hole over there. There's a bullet hole right there. One over there. And there's one right above the door over there. -Carmen, por favor, I really have to go. -No, no, no no, no. Don't give me any of this I have to go stuff, OK? [speaking spanish] Frank. He looks like he hasn't eaten in months. -Hey, don't look at me, because you know when a Puerto Rican woman decides to feed you, just open up your mouth and chew! -Eat. -Welp, since you put it that way. NYDIA: I can't wear this dress. Look at this. My boobs are falling out! FRANK: You look beautiful! [music playing] -[speaking spanish]. I knew it. Why can't anybody tell me when we have company? -Because you're the only one who considers Manny company. -Look, I-- I was, uh-- I was leaving anyway. -Manny, I'm sorry. I didn't mean that. -No. Oh, please. -It's just that you always catch me by surprise. -Yeah, well, I, uh-- I guess I could say the same thing about you. -Uh, Manny. I know this is kind of last minute, but we're gonna open soon. Could you stay and help us out just before we get started? -What are you doing? We can manage this. Besides, I'm sure Manny has a lot of things to do. Don't you have something to do? -No. As a matter of fact I don't. -(SARCASTIC) Fine. Fine. Is this how you want to spend your evening. OK. You take tables one through five, and I'll take six through ten. -And first of all, in case you've already forgotten, I've done this plenty of times before, so I don't need you telling me what to do. And secondly, I'm not doing this for you. I'm doing it for your parents. -Well, now that that's settled, I'll go check on the beans. -Can I open up now? -Go ahead. Let them in. -Bienvenidos. Welcome. Hello, and welcome to the Mambo Cafe. Today's special is Nydia's chuletas. -Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever. You know that we've been outside in the cold for 20 minutes? When the hell are we gonna sit down? -Uh, Manny. -Right away. Nydia herself is going to take care of you. -Come with me, please. -Hey. And don't go putting us at a table near the kitchen either! -Hola. We would like Una, mesa for tres, por favor. -Ah, si. [speaking spanish]. Why don't you come with me, eh? I have, how do you say, the perfect table for two. -Oh! -All right. -This is Nydia. She will, how do you say, will be on honored to serve you. -Oh. Gracias. -Thank-- thank you very much. Thanks. -Mommy, why is she wearing that thing on her head? -Honey, what did mommy tell you about foreigners? -That we should stay away from them because they have diseases? -No. -The other thing. Sometimes they wear colorful costumes because they pray to gods that are different than ours. -Could you excuse me a second. -Oh. You speak English! -[speaking spanish]. What the hell are you doing? Is this why you stay? To give me a hard time. -Look, I'm sorry, OK? It's just that you're always so serious. I-- I just thought it might make you laugh. -Make me laugh? Look at the way I'm dressed. I wear business suits and carry a brief case in Boston. And those people over there think that I'm dressed like this to pray to gods. What's the hell is so funny? -Nothing. -Just forget about it, OK? Sorry, we had a slight emergency. Uh, have you had a chance to look at the menu? -Ah, yes. Yes. Can you tell me, what is Fat Tony's last meal? -Isn't my wife incredible? One day she's in this country and already she speaks perfect English. -Isn't there something you should be doing? -I got-- of course. How stupid of me. This is our favorite song. We must dance. -They're gonna dance! [music playing] -See? This is exactly why I love these Latins. The world could be falling down around them, and all they want to do is dance! [bells ringing] MAN ON STREET: I'm thinking of goin' somewhere-- Canada or something. SECOND MAN ON STREET: I wan going down to Miami. MAN ON STREET: Oh really? It's hot over there. You know, so I don't know. -Listen, Joey. I just want to thank you for taking care of that Fat Tony problem. I know me and him were-- we grew up together. He was nine years old and we shook down our first tourists right over there on 5th Street. And that son of a bitch-- that greedy, ungrateful, double-crossing son of a bitch, he had the nerve to steal from me. Anyway, I want to thank you. I owe you. Now, thank you. -[italian] Remember that Fat Tony thing? -Yeah, what about it, Joey? -I always thought Angelo took care of him-- you know, Fat Tony being his cousin and whatnot. -Yeah, we too. -So how come just now Angelo comes up and thanks me for taking care of him? -I don't know, Joey. -I want you two to see what you can find out about him. And don't say squat to nobody, you hear? -Yeah. We got it covered, Joey. Don't worry about it. -[speaking spanish]. -And you said that you, uh, you read about this place in the "New Yorker"? -It wasn't exactly "The New Yorker," but what's the difference? Every time you guys come to town, we go to some boring Broadway play and then over to Joe Allen's. I just thought you'd appreciate something different for a change. -It looks fine to me. -[speaking spanish] -Here you go, and someone will be with you shortly. -Come. Come, come. -Jesus, Ma! You forgot the tostones again! -I can't be expected to remember everything. -[speaking spanish] -They're right there in front of you! -[speaking spanish] -And you, when you finish playing Ricardo Montalban, could you give me a hand in the kitchen, please! -Hey Ricky. You gotta bus table number seven. -Welcome to Mambo Cafe. Uh, can I get you something to drink before you start? -Yup. I'd like a water. -Chris? Just what are you doing here? -What am I doing here? What am I doing here? You're supposed to be in-- in Argentina, for Christ's sake. What about your sick mother? --[speaking spanish] I'm your mother, not your slave. Remember to pick up your orders. I can't keep bringing them out here for you. Here. -Oh my god. I can explain this. See, I was going to tell you. It's just that-- uh. -Chris. Who is this person? -Dad, this is Nydia. Nydia, this is my father and my mother and my sister Stacy. -Hi, Nydia. -Hi. It's a pleasure to meet all of you. Listen, Chris. I can explain this, OK? -Let me get this straight. This is the Nydia we're supposed to meet? -How did you say you two met? -I'm getting another headache. -Chr-- Chris! Hold this, please. Chris, wait a second. Please, Chris, I know how this looks. But please, give me a chance to explain. -Nydia. I don't understand how you could do this to me? -I admit it. It was stupid. I should have been straight from the beginning. But can you honestly say that you wouldn't have done what every other guy ever does? -What? -You know, Chris. In your city exotics for a couple of months. -Come on, Nydia. -Maybe even a whole semester. And then, the second they start hinting of anything more than a little cuchi-cuchi, out comes their hundred and one excuses. -Cuchi-cuchi? You know somehow that really sounds appropriate with what you're wearing. -I was going to tell you. -When! -I just wanted us to know each other better. -Yeah, well, I guess I got to know you pretty well, didn't I, Nydia? -Trust me. You got off easy. Six months with my boring brother, you would have been ready for a lobotomy. -We shouldn't have left her in Puerto Rico for all those years. I feel like it's all my fault. -Frank, it's no one's fault. We brought her here as soon as we could. -Yeah. Maybe you're right. -Hey. You OK? -Just the way his parents were looking at me, like I had ruined their precious son or something. -You know how some people are, huh? I mean I go through that same kind of stuff when I'm trying to sell things. If the box doesn't say Tiffany's, they can't see that there still might be a priceless stone inside. -Hmm. -You mind if I ask you something? I-- I just don't understand why you have to go around pretending to be somebody else. Because to me you're the most intelligent and beautiful woman I've ever met. -Manny, why? Why do you continue to be nice to me? I've been treating you like such a-- -No argument there. But we're friends, and it just doesn't make any sense to me to ruin all those nice memories just because we're going our separate ways. -Can I ask you a question? MANNY: Go ahead. -What is going to happen to you? I mean you're intelligent, and you're a terrific salesman. I think you can do bigger things. You should have your own store, maybe even expanding to a chain or something. Maybe-- maybe you should take some business classes. -Thanks. But I think college is a little out of my league. -What are you talking about? Manny, three-quarters of the people in my class don't have half the talent you have. [phone ringing] -Harvard's on the phone. -Go ahead. Go, go. -Ah, be right back, OK? -Yeah, yeah. -No, it's OK. It's OK, Chris. Um, I-- I'm really glad you called me back. You know, everything-- everything was really crazy. Yeah, I'm sorry about everything. Um, can I call you in a moment? OK. All right. Manny! Manny! Look, Chris. Um, I-- I'm really very sorry about everything. I mean this whole thing has turned into an absolute nightmare. -I'm sorry, too. Especially about my initial reaction. You know, it was just really strange that you were-- -No, no, no. Believe me, it was my fault. I-- -I am still curious about something, though. I would have to find out some time. What did you think would happen then? -I don't know what is going to happen, Chris. -I-- I think we should continue to talk. Look, that didn't exactly come out right. What I mean is I think we should start again. I mean if that's what you want. -I'd really like that. -Great. -Great. -Oh, boy. -What's wrong? -Billy and Marissa are there and they go to school with me. -So? -So-- so I already told them about you being from Argentina. Billy and I have always been competitive and I'll never hear the end of it once he finds out you're from, you know, Spanish Harlem. Look, would you mind if we left it like that for right now? It's just too complicated to get into this whole thing right now. -Chris-- Chris, if you don't mind, I'd really like to put that behind us. You're going to have him sooner or later anyway. -Could you just do this for me? It's a lot easier this way for us. Oh, look, there's Adam. I didn't realize he come back from Australia already. Ha! Hello! -Hey! How are ya! -Hello! -Hey! -Nice to see you! -All right. -Everyone, this is Nydia. Nydia, this is Billy, Amy, Lynn. That's Marissa and Adam. -Hi. -I hope you remember all that. You'll be tested on it later. -So you're from Argentina. -Yeah. -Do you know that my brother actually met Gabriella Sabatini when he was there last month? -Well, actually, I am not-- -Nydia's actually from a different part of Argentina than Gabriella. Isn't that right, Nydia? Don't you live in a different part of Argentina? -Yes, Chris. It's a good two hours away. -This guy has always had a thing for Latin women, like you wouldn't believe. Remember that Italian girl? She was related to the Ferrari family. She had an al-- this ranch in the Alps of the Poconos or some damn place-- 4,000 acres. -Billy, don't you think Chris might want to share those stories with Nydia-- -Yeah. - --some other time? -You're right. In my condition I wouldn't do them justice anyway. So how many acres does your ranch have? -Billy! -It's not so big. About 12,000 acres. -12,000 acres? -Nydia. -Well that-- that's like that's as big as Rhode Island. -But that's just our place in Argentina. We also have a beautiful place in the South of France that my great aunt Eva Peron bought. It's not as large, but it's so perfect for Christmas gatherings. But let me tell you something. My absolute most favorite place is actually this quaint little island off the coast of Greece that my father won from Onassis in a poker game. It's incredible. We have dolphins and that gorgeous view. -Excuse me. Excuse us. Would you mind if I speak to you over here for a minute, please. -Of course, my love. -All right. -Could you excuse us? -She has a place for Christmas gatherings. -What are you doing? Are you trying to humiliate me? -I'm doing exactly what you asked me to do, Chris-- to keep lying, which says a lot about how seriously you're taking this. -Look, I have every intention of telling them. I just didn't want to do it right now. -Let's face it, Chris. You don't want to do it now. You don't want to do it ever. Look, it's getting pretty late. I have to be getting back. -Well, let me say goodbye and I'll take you home. -It's OK, Chris. Why don't you stay with your friends? I can get a cab. -Are you sure? -Yeah. I'm sure. Take care of yourself, OK? [knocking] -Do you have a minute? -Of course, Dad. --[sighs] You know, we, uh, been so busy lately, we haven't had a chance to talk. So how you feeling? -I'm OK. I just-- you know, Dad. -I mean with Chris and everything. -I don't think we're going to be seeing each other anymore, if that's what you want to know. -Hmm. This isn't going to effect anything? I mean, you know, with school and everything. -Dad, Dad, we're going to different schools. -Oh, because, you know, when we set our goals, there's always something pinching you here and pulling at you there. This restaurant, for example, oh, it's had some good times, but most of the time it's just a big pain in the you know what. I guess what I'm trying to tell you is that this place is not going to get us a mansion in Long Island or anything. The only reason we keep hanging in there, it's because, well, for us it's doing something much more important, and that is it's allowing you to be our first college graduate. This is, uh, part of your tuition money. I figured that would at least get you a seat. We'll worry about sending the rest to you later. Because who knows what could happen from here, right? Huh? I mean, you can grow up to be the president of your own company, or maybe one of your kids could be a senator. Hey, how about President of the United States, why not? Huh? -Thanks. Thanks, Dad. But let me just finish next semester first, OK? -Yeah, yeah. Guess, uh, just keep doing what you're doing, because we're all very proud of you. -Thank you, Dad. [door closing] -Frank. Frank. Come in here, hurry up. -What is it? -Look. -What are they doing here? Well, hurry up. Turn off the lights. -It's too late for that, Frank. [knocking] [knocking] -Hey, Frank, how you doing? Mind if we come inside? -Uh, I'm doing OK. How are you guys doing? -Not too good. You see, there's this little problem we've got to take care of. Maybe it's better if we talked out here. -Yeah, sure, whatever you say. -Ma. Ma, what are you doing? -Those two idiotas are back. -What did they want? -They said the mafia didn't do the hit on fat Tony and that they didn't like other people sticking their nose and their business. Then they started to ask me where Ricky was when fat Tony got hit. -What? Do they think that Ricky-- -They wanted to talk to him. So I lied, told them that he was sleeping over at a friend's house. Then I thought about it. I remembered that Ricky wasn't in the restaurant when Tony got hit. -So that's good, isn't it? -No, not really. -So what are you saying, Frank, that Ricky was in the car shooting those bullets? -Hey, don't yell at me. I'm not saying anything. It's them. -This is crazy. Ricky! Ricky! Ricky, come down here right now. -Yeah, what? What is it? I finished all my work already. What? I got stuff on my face or something? -Ricky, do you know how fat Tony, you know, came to his end? -Yeah. He got wasted in a drive by. Why are you asking me that? -Because those two idiotas were just here, and they said that none of them did it. And now they're trying to find out who did do it so they can bury him a pair of cement boots. Ricky, do you know anything about that? -So what are you say, that I did it? -We're not saying anything. It's just that-- -Look, those guys don't know jack, OK? They can't prove anything. -Ricky, these are not your little friends you're playing with here. Those monsters don't have to prove anything. -I'm only going to ask you this once, Ricky. Do you know anything about this or not? -Look, I've got to get out of here. -No, you don't! -You know, I'm not so sure this is such a good idea. -I don't need you lecturing me right now. I told you, we've looked for him everywhere. I just want to talk to them, OK? -What about the police? -The police? And tell them what, that my little brother killed some mafia guys, so they can throw him in jail the rest of his life? Manny, are you going to help me with this or not? -Look, uh, Manny here keeps me looking sharp with new suits at the end of each month. And right now I'd like to help you guys out. But what you're asking me to do is to violate a code that's been with us for hundreds upon hundreds of years, going back to when? -Our earliest ancestors in Italy. -Your families must always take care of their own business. I'm sorry, but no can do. -Hey, Joey, what do you know about this painting? Does it go like this? Or does it go like this? -No, no. -I know, but we're thinking about-- -Look, I don't understand what the big deal is. I'm sure anybody who even looked at that Fat Tony pig for more than a second would be happy he's gone. -Miss, you don't seem to understand. Granted, anybody from here to Istanbul wanted this guy dead. But what is it going to look like? Every time we have a little problem, somebody from the outside comes in to clean it up for us. I mean, this is about honor. It's a matter of respect. Now you tell me, how am I supposed to go out in public after something like this? -I'll tell you. Maybe this will help you. -No. Ah! -What are you doing? -That hurt. -Manny, are you OK? -How can you do me like this? Out of the kindness of my heart, I agreed to-- oh, shit. What time is it? Come on, hit it. [music playing] (SINGING) Give my regards to Broadway. Remember me the Herald Square. Tell all the gang at 42nd Street that I will soon be there. Remember how I've been yearning to mingle with the old time prong. Oh, give my regards to old Broadway, and tell them I'll be there along. -All right, Joey. [clapping] -Good, good. Look, if it's not enough, maybe I can-- -What are we playing? -Hey, put me down. You-- -Hey, hey, take it easy, OK? Look, you don't even have to-- -And stay the hell out. Shut up! -You're really something special, you know that? Why do you always think you're the only one who knows to do anything? -Manny, I'm sorry. Are you OK? -No. No, I'm not OK. And another thing, where did you get all that money? -It was my tuition money. I was supposed to put it in the bank. What are we going to do? -What are we-- what are we gonna do? The money's gone. You blew it. -I was talking about Ricky. -I don't know what we're going to do about Ricky, OK? I just wish I would have saved you the money so you can go back to Boston. -What happened? -It's my fault. I asked Manny to take me to this crazy singing mafia guy. They slapped him around, and I lost my tuition money. -You what? -But Ricky didn't do it. He's back here already. RICKY: See what I mean? Nobody ever listens to anything I say. For the millionth time, I didn't do it, OK? El Loco was the one that did it. He did it on his own. And now I got to be hiding out in this stupid dress till we can figure out what to do. -What the hell does El Loco have to do with it? Why would he do something like this? -Hey, I don't know, because he's El Loco, that's all. Look, I told them once how we couldn't get rid of Fat Tony, so I guess he just decided to do us all a favor. -Hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute. What's the big deal? All we have to do is go over there and explain to these guys, and we get the money back, right? -Frank, what are you talking about? This poor crazy boy goes out and risks his life for us, and now we're going to hand him over to these monsters for a lousy $3,000? -All right, all right, it's a bad idea. But they still think that Ricky did it, so what are we going to do? -OK, Nydia, you take Ricky back to Gilberto's and hide him out. And Manny, you take me over see these mafia guys right now. -Are you crazy? You cannot reason with them. -Well, there's no way I'm going over there. These guys have a thing about not hitting women and taking everything out on men. -Carmen, whatever you're thinking, forget about it. I'm going to figure out a way to get us out of this. -OK. All of those in favor of me going out and finding these sons of bitches myself and hitting them over the head with a very hard bat until they agree to leave my son Ricky alone, raise your hands. -OK, obviously it's a unanimous decision. -Carmen. -Ma. -What are you-- -There's one thing I can say about you people is you got a lot nerve. -I know you're a very busy man, and we really appreciate you seeing us. But I also understand that you want to do bodily harm to my only son. And I just want you to look me straight in the eye and not see me as a woman but as a mother, and believe me when I tell you that there's no way in hell I am ever going to allow that to happen, OK? -That's not what she meant. You've got to understand Puerto Rican women. I mean, they're so dramatic. -Don't get me wrong. I also understand that you're a very powerful man and that at any time you could take us out and have us buried under 20 tons of cement. But as the son of what I am sure is a very wonderful woman, I need for you to believe that I know my son and that there's no way that boy could ever do anything like that. -May I speak now? -Go ahead. -You don't seem to understand. I'm in a spot here. I got people I've got to answer to. I got to take care of this. [phone ringing] -Yeah. I don't give a shit if his entire family got a heart attack. This is my daughter's wedding. We got one day, and every caterer from here to Hoboken's already booked. You found this bum. You got two hours to come up with somebody. -So you-- you have a daughter too? Our daughter, she's got one year left at Boston University. -Yeah, we met. -Look, Mr. Joey, me and you, we have a lot of things in common. We both came from another country. We're both trying to do our best for our children. Uh, of course we go about it in different ways. What I'm saying here is that guys like us, we got to work together. As a matter of fact, I even think I might have found a way to get you out of this little predicament you have with your daughter's wedding. -Oh, yeah? How you gonna do that? -Well, we could cater the wedding for you. -Thanks, but I don't think Puerto Rican food will go over too well with this crowd. -Excuse me, Joey, I think it's a good idea. Think about it. -Yeah, Joey, we've been eating there for, what, Carmen, a couple of weeks? -Seems like a lifetime. -It's your call, Joey, but, uh, I got to go on record here, this woman's food is exceptional. -And I don't mean to step on your toes either, Joey, but exotic cuisines seem to be in this year. Remember that Hawaiian luau thing at Pauly's daughter's wedding? -And how about that Jamaican think Angelo threw for Gianpaulo's birthday party last month? I saw you, you were eating and you were-- and the limbo, huh? Right? -I'll tell you what-- you say you're sure your son didn't do Fat Tony? You know what, I believe you. And you know why, because I think you people know who did it. So I'll tell you what I'm going to do, I'm going to make a deal with you. You can handle the catering, and we'll forget about your son, on one condition, you tell me who did it. Now look, like I told you before, I got people I got to answer to. You tell me who did it, and I guarantee you I'll take care of it so everybody is nice and happy. Hit it! (SINGING) So one of these days, you're gonna miss me, baby. So one of these days, you're gonna be so lonely. -El Loco doesn't look dead. He looks like he got spilled ketchup on his chest. I could have done better than that myself. -What are you talking about? I saw plenty of guys in this position, and I'm tell you, that's the way they look. -Yeah. And we already showed them to some dead beats, and you should have seen how fast they coughed up they money. -Yeah, right. Look at this, no dead guy would be holding a yo-yo in his hand. Listen, can I get one of these so I can show it to El Loco? He's in Puerto Rico. -Yeah, I'm sure he could use a good laugh by now. -Yeah. -Don't show that to anybody, you hear? -Yeah, I won't. -You know, I talked to his father in Puerto Rico. He said he was going to stay in the pig farm until he's old enough for social security. -Yeah, he better. He'll get really whacked. -No, no, no. Don't let the paper fall off. -OK, OK. -Don't tilt it, because the juices will fall out. -You got it, OK. -OK. That's right. No, not on the seat, on the floor. Frank-- -Yeah, yeah. -Coming. Joey says thanks, and he's sorry he couldn't be here, but he's still rehearsing for his daughter's wedding. -Is he? -Oh, I almost forgot. I want you to have this. -Oh. "Joey Sings Christmas." Oh, that's wonderful. Frank. -Yeah, "Killing Me Softly." -Wonderful. -Hi. -Hi. Is everything all right? -Yeah. Ricky told me you were taking classes here, and I-- I-- -Oh, um, yeah, well, I-- I did a lot of thinking about what you said about not living up to my potential. -Well, I think this is great. I'm so proud of you. Manny. Look, uh, I just wanted to tell you that I'm really very sorry about everything, Manny. I've been confused about the little things, and I'm still trying to work them out. Anyway, I just wanted you to know that. I still care about you very much. And I-- I guess I just wanted you to know that. Look, I have to be getting back to the restaurant. -Nydia. Look, uh, about this whole college thing, um, I don't know if I can do it full time, like you do. But I thought I'd start out with maybe a course or two and, uh, see how it goes. -Manny, this is going to be so easy for you. Look at this. They have really good professors here. Manny, can ask you a question? Have you figured out what all this is going to cost you? -See, there you go again. -What? -You know, you're probably going to faint when you hear this, but you know, there are actually some guys around here who don't spend their paychecks every week hanging out and drinking beer. You know, sometimes we even put some of it in the bank. -Will you just stop it. That's not what I meant. -Even if I did this, I'd have to go full time. It's not like I'm going to leave the neighborhood and go to some fancy school up north. You know, I could afford a couple thousand dollars a semester, OK? I've got to go. -Just shut up for a minute. Manny, I was asking for me. -So what are you saying, that you want to transfer down here? -Well, I was just thinking, since I was going to be here anyway, maybe I should take a couple of those business courses and then get them transferred later on or something. -Nydia, this is going to be great. I mean, you could write my papers for me. You could do my research. I mean, you could take notes. -Wait a minute. Wait a minute. I've been studying business out of books. If anything, you should be helping me. -But this is only going to be for a semester, right? I mean, you are going to go back up there, because I don't want you giving up and feeling like a failure. -Oh, you don't want me giving up? -Well, yeah, I mean, the last thing I need is a girlfriend with a self-esteem problem. -Oh, so now I'm your girlfriend again? Hey, aren't we assuming a little too much here? Hmm? Manny, have you ever noticed what the first three letters of assume are? [music playing]
