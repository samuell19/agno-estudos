All clear. -Aren't these stairs just exquisite? The home comes fully furnished with all of the owners' luxurious furnishings and sublime decorations. I just love this bedroom. It's so stylish and sexy. But follow me. You're gonna love this. His and her bathtubs. -Okay, I was not expecting that. -Don't you just love it? Why are you relocating from Mexico City? We just needed a change of scenery. Oh. Oh, that's the owner. He's a really fun guy. The kitchen is furnished with the highest quality Wolf, Sub-Zero, Miele. You've got your luxurious custom cabinetry. Italian imported marble counter. I guess your English isn't as good as you thought. It even has a built-in microwave. Look, guys, I would love to let you have this place, but I need to know that you're committed. The previous tenant just vanished with several The owner does not want to deal with that again. We are ready to move in today. -Whatever it takes. -That's great to hear. Houses like this do not come up that often. Can we do one more walkthrough on the second floor? -Of course. -But alone so we can discuss? Oh, right. Certainly. Thank you. The first thing we should do is take his and her baths, huh? Oh, well that sounds very exquisite and luxurious. It's kind of weird, right, with all of the owner's strange decorations? I'm surprised you actually don't like them. They remind me of the stuff that you get -I miss Coyoacan. -And we'll get back there. But right now, we need a place for you to rest Okay, we're Californians now! Mi amor,Eva, bebecita, what's wrong? Nothing. Isn't there a place in a gated community, preferably with a security guard? This is a safe house in a safe neighborhood. Our neighborhood in Mexico City was supposed to be safe. And besides, this place is too big Mmm. Now see, that's where you're wrong. We're gonna have an enormous family. And we should probably get started right now. Oh, snap! -Not now! -Ugh! Boring! Ugh... There's one more feature I'd like to show you. It's the real reason you want to rent a home A state-of-the-art security system. The latest in smart home security tech. It connects to your phone, laptop, and mounted wall unit. Not only the alarm system, but also lights, temperature, everything. -Are you good with technology? -He's almost mastered texting. -I rely on her. -Oh, then you'll love Security cameras are throughout the house, which can be accessed by your phone or computer. All doors and windows are alarmed. No one is getting in here unless you let them. It's even got a scary name-- "Die-ablo" Controls. -Everything okay? -Mm. Yeah, it's just pronounced "Diablo." Access denied. Motion detected, third floor. Hello? Eva? Miguel? You're not working on those niños,are you? Motion detected, second floor. Okay, never mind. Motion detected, staircase. All clear. This is kind of weird. Yeah, it's not as sexy as I thought it was gonna be. Well, should we try squeezing into one? Oh, Miguel, you don't even fit into that one. Oh, I'll make it fit. -Who keeps texting you? -It's just work. What's so important that they're texting Well, they need me in Mexico City. When? Tonight. I can't believe this, you're packing to leave You know I don't have a choice. Can't you spend the night here and fly out first thing I told you there's a client dinner tonight, amor. I can't be alone in this big house. There are 10 million light switches, and I don't know how to lock the doors yet. You'll figure it out, okay? I'm gone for a week. Not even, just five days. -I'm coming with you. -No, Eva! We literally just left there because you didn't feel safe. You're safe here. Okay, this place is like a resort. It's quiet, it's peaceful. Look, a break like this is exactly what you needed We've been planning for this. You've got your program. Okay. But what happened to... this big family we're starting ? Mm. Yes, coming out right now. Oh, I am so late. If I miss that plane, I'm dead. You're such a bad influence. Wait, what about the alarm? -What about it? -How do I set it? Oh, they're sending out a tech guy tomorrow Tomorrow? What about tonight? Shit, this is crazy. -I'm sorry, babe. I'm canceling the trip. -You should go. You have to go. -What about the alarm? We're in a safe neighborhood. We probably don't even need an alarm. -You sure? -I'm sure. Okay, I love you. All right. Mwah! Bye. I gotta go. Love you. Invalid passcode. Invalid passcode. Thank you for calling Diablo Controls. Your call is important to us. The next agent will be available in six minutes. Your call is important to us. The next agent will be available in six minutes. Your call is important to us. The next agent will be available in six minutes. I just wanted to hear your voice. I'm feeling a little... scared and alone right now. First night and all. So... call me when you get this. I love you. Elevated heart rate. It's 6:00 in the morning. Time to rise and shine. Ooh! Who are you? What are you doing here? Oh, I'm sorry to disturb you. Um, I'm the technician from Diablo Controls. Do you usually just walk into people's backyards? I'm sorry for the intrusion. I called, and when no one picked up, I thought I'd just come by and check the property. And then I saw you swimming and, well, here we are. Yeah, okay. I'm gonna need you to give me a minute, and I'll meet you at the front door. Okay. Okay, punch in the four-digit code. This will be your personal passcode to activate and deactivate the system. So make sure you remember it and don't tell anybody. Even me. Passcode confirmed. Okay, you remember it? -Yep. -Great. Uh, if the alarm is on and you open a door the alarm will go off and it is really loud. If the code isn't entered within 60 seconds, then an armed security patrolman will be at your door -Can I see your phone? -Why? Just to sync it to the system so that you can control everything -Alerts and all. -That necessary? It's highly recommended. For example, if you leave the house the system will notify you so you don't walk in on And it has rapid video playback, so you can see exactly where that intruder is Smart woman. Okay. I can even go deeper. It even tracks biometric data like sleep patterns Can we just stick with the basic alarm system here? Gotcha. Just figured I'd ask because the last family that lived here had their entire lives synced to the system. Is that why I get a 6:00 a.m. wake-up call? That is exactly why. I apologize for that. Let me you fix that for you, okay? Okay, yeah, so it's just basic AI that's gonna study you, learn who you are, your behaviors, your patterns, your movements. System ready. Oh. You're all set. From your phone, you can control the lights, activate or deactivate the alarm. You have access to all the cameras, and the system will notify you if it detects any unidentified motion. Why would it need to detect motion? You'll want to know where your threat That's a comforting thought. Yeah, don't worry about it at all. This neighborhood is super quiet. Nothing ever happens. All right. Entering sleep mode. You think you know me? You don't know the first thing about me. Lights out. Good night. Motion detected, hallway. Motion detected, hallway. All clear.

Every time I try to call you, there's a new fire Well, I'm on fire, and it's not gonna be You are on fire and you're hot, hot, hot. And I am so dumb, dumb, dumb! I'm not disagreeing with you. In my defense, I didn't get your voicemail about the alarm system till today. It's okay. Um, everything is good, actually. I'm settling in, the house is great, Ah, you have no idea how happy that makes me feel. -You got any plans for today? -Uh, yes. I, too, have a very important day I was just drinking a single cup of coffee and sending my resumé to a recruiter. And now I'm going to grab the newspaper and then I will read said newspaper. And then after that, I'll go for a jog. Nice, sounds like a full day. Did you figure out the alarm system? Yeah, the tech guy came over yesterday It's really complicated, but I'm getting the hang of it. Sounds like it! Damn, I can't remember the code! Fuck! Did you try your ATM PIN number, Ha, very funny and helpful! All clear. Sorry! Not a burglar! Just me trying to figure out my alarm system. Wow, sounds like you really mastered it. You're gonna have to teach me when I get home. Yeah, right. I can't figure out if this thing is going to protect me or if it's going to kill me. System armed. System disarmed. System armed. Why is everything fucking complicated? Thank you for calling Diablo Controls. Your call is important to us. The next agent will be available in six minutes.

How's the house? This is very sweet of you. Everything's great. We're very happy. Well, if you need anything at all, I've lived here a long, long time, so I know all there is to know about the neighborhood. Great. Have you joined Neighbor Network yet? No, not yet. Oh, do yourself a favor and join right away. It's a great resource. You'll meet all the neighbors. If anything happens in the neighborhood at all, it'll be up on Neighbor Network immediately. If a crime has been committed, it'll be up on the site before the police even arrive. Hey, it's how I found out that I have you as my neighbor. Wow. Uh, I'm sorry, I have to go, but it was very nice to meet you. -Oh, okay. Bye. -Bye. Hmm. Motion detected, kitchen. I know you're in here! Aw, man. I loved that mug. Hmm. Dropped the package at 9:42. But the alert came at 9:48. That's so weird. What the heck is that? That's weird. How the hell did they get my email? Well, that's pretty racist! Looks like my new neighbors aren't so neighborly after all. Oh, my God! Motion detected, front door. Thank you. ...you are my hot fire. I'll see you again in a few days. Love, Miguel."

Uh, you okay? You sound like something bad just happened. Yeah, something's happened. Lots of things have happened. What are you talking about? What happened? Julie's house was just broken into Who the fuck is Julie? And then Frank's doorbell recorded a crazy man yelling outside his door. And then Cynthia V. just posted that-- Who are Julie and Frank? What are you talking about? Our neighborhood is not as safe as you think. Eva, tell me what happened. I signed up on the Neighborhood Oh, Jesus. I told you not to do that, okay? That site makes everybody paranoid. It's real. They post photographs of people breaking into their homes. But they probably don't have such a fancy, Well, that's true. Where are you, by the way? Home. I-- I mean, our old home. I miss it. I miss you. I miss you, too. Look, I've gotta go to another client dinner. I just wanted to hear your voice and make sure I did. Thank you. They're beautiful. Okay. All right. Well, please, please, please do me a favor and cancel that membership. Okay? I love you. Okay, I love you. Elevated heart rate. Elevated heart rate. Miguel? It's 6:00 in the morning. Time to rise and shine. No. No, I don't have an appointment and I don't live in Mexico City anymore. I was just hoping that she could squeeze me in for an emergency session. System disarmed. Hola, Eva! Of course. I was hoping to hear from you. I just wasn't expecting it to be so soon after your move. Is everything okay? Not really. I have a dream again. -The nightmare. -El Diablo. Eva, let's try and sit down for a moment. We can calm down. I understand dreams can be terrifying, especially when they're so vivid. But El Diablo is not looking for you in California. You know that. It's common for people who've gone through what you went through, truly believing you were going to die, to suffer from post-traumatic stress. There's no reason why he let me live. -The police said that-- -I know what the police said. He killed two other women that night he left my home. It's not your fault. I'm sorry for bothering you, Dr. Olivares. We just moved into a new home and Miguel is away on business. And it's the first time I'm alone since that night. And I just feel like I'm going crazy. Everything is new and I feel so out of place. New country, new house, new goddamn alarm system that just seems to be tormenting me. Big changes tend to bring up these issues. There's a lot of stress surrounding big events, and stress is a trigger. How about restarting my meds again? We've worked too hard to move beyond your dependence on medication. Our program is working. Stick to the plan. Focus on a healthy lifestyle to reduce stress. Healthy eating, daily exercise, and sleep. Meditate, get a massage. -Unplug and relax. -I know, but-- Eva, the meds are only a temporary band-aid. We have our program and it is working. Remember, stress will increase paranoia and could lead to hallucinations. It's a nasty feedback cycle, which means you need to stay away from triggers to another episode, like alcohol or caffeine, staying up late, or even watching scary movies, or seeing disturbing imagery. Accept that these things are only happening So no coffee or alcohol? It is possible, Eva. Well, thank you, Dr. Olivares. It's always a pleasure to talk to you. Stay strong. And let's schedule a session for later this week Eva? Yes, Dr. Olivares. That sounds great. Thank you. Goodbye. I was just calling to say goodnight. I wanted to hear your voice since we didn't get When you're on your way home, just please don't eat dinner because I have something exquisite planned. Okay. I love you. Good night. Lights out. Good night. Call silenced. Sorry I just missed you. I'm just at another client dinner here, okay? Um, they need me here for a couple more days. I'm so sorry, love. I'm gonna make it up to you, but it's just two more days, and then I'm home for good. Okay. I'm sorry. I love you. I'll try you tomorrow, okay? All right, get some rest. Voicemail deleted.

There's no one in the house. It was just a glitch. No, no, I-- I heard somebody walking down the hall. The floors were creaking. It's an old-ass house. It creaks. I got an alert from the third and second floor. Relax, just calm down, all right? There's a system outage in the neighborhood. Okay? That's why I'm out here checking it.

You could say that. -That doesn't sound good. -It's not good. I feel like that thing is trying to harass me. Every time I set the alarm, it locks the doors. I get "motion detected" alerts all the time, even when there's nothing there. And now, whenever I look at the security cam footage, there's always this glitchy little figure of light It sounds like you're experiencing I don't wanna experience any more artifacting. Exactly. I don't know too many of my clients -It's a little creepy. -A little? So whenever you see a young girl on screen, it's just remnants in the system cache. It's not like some spooky spirit trying to scare you, you know? I never said anything about a young girl. No? You didn't-- you didn't just say something about that? -No. -You know what? It was-- it's the family that used to live here before. They had a six-year-old girl and that must be what it was. Okay. And did this previous family experience as many issues as I'm having? You know, just minor nicks here and there. You know, like you said, the doors locking and... But after the system got to know them, -Okay. -Yeah. Cache cleared. And boom. Just cleared the cache and reset the system, But feel free to call me if you need anything. -Thank you. -All right. Motion detected, hallway. Let's see if he fixed this artifacting.

My husband was supposed to come home and he didn't, so I was angry. I needed to blow off some steam. I understand, but you need to be careful. You're in a fragile state and could hurt yourself. I'm starting to rethink our decision not to go No, I, uh... I slept better last night. I didn't have a nightmare. But you mentioned hallucinations at our and I wanted to let you know that I had one.

It's gonna hurt me, I know. -How can it hurt you? -I can't say anything more. It's listening. Just leave and don't go back to your house. Just leave and never go back. I don't understand. Why don't you just leave? It's too late for me. Hey, how are you? How are you adjusting to the neighborhood? -It's been an adjustment. -It's a lot. New city, new house, new country. Yeah, it's a lot. Are you planning on having children? You know, it's an awfully big house We've discussed it. The family who lived here before you, they had one child, a young daughter. And they were planning on having more -Disappeared? -The realtor didn't tell you? It was the darnedest thing. They were the nicest people. I knew them well, or... I thought that I did, and then one day, They even left their stuff behind. What happened to them? Like I said, they disappeared. Poof, into thin air without a trace. It was the darnedest thing.

All of the reviews were weirdly positive And then yesterday, my neighbor complained about his alarm system and it's the same company And I met him at his house, and within hours of talking to me, his house caught on fire and he died. Don't you see? Eva, I don't think your alarm system And it's possible the alarm system received because people were genuinely pleased with it. No, no! Wait, please, Dr. Olivares, Before, when I was seeing things It was my imagination and my PTSD. But I know the difference now. I will prescribe you a refill of your medication, but only for a limited time. I want to keep you safe. And here's a thought. Why don't you just disable your alarm? I don't know how. It's something we can explore. -There's a girl. -A girl? Yes. And she lived in this house before. Her and her family vanished, but she's still here. They're trapped in the alarm system. Trapped in the alarm system? -Have you been drinking again? -A little, but... Email my assistant the pharmacy information. I'll have the prescription prepared. Okay. -Dr. Olivares... -Yes.
