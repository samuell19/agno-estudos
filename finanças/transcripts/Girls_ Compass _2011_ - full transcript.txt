By the way, Maria, Wasn't this your hometown? Yes. Do you miss it? Yes. This time, it's an online release, If it goes well, we'll reshoot it and release it in theaters. Yes, I'm aware. Be careful around that area. Excuse me. I'm the assistant director, Ijawa. Thank you for your hard work. This is Maria. Please take care of me. - Nice to meet you. - It's nothing special, but please enjoy together. Thank you. I'll be indebted to you. The set is up there. watch your step. This feels a bit eerie. - We're dismantling this, it's dangerous. - Okay. Be careful. Maria is here. Hello. You're early, Maria. Director Mezaki, please take care of me. Sure. Director, I'm really grateful this time. Since Yamada hasn't arrived yet, can you wait a moment? Sure. Director, please take care of me. Access is prohibited from the 4th floor and above. What happened? The producer said not to go up. But this abandoned school... the atmosphere is no joke. Isn't it? Director. Maria might appear like that, but she's quite the actress. We've talked about it before. - I understand. - Yes? Maria. It's Maria, you know. You was on that Compass , right? A legendary troupe composed of four high school students. A Compass? You didn't know about Tyra-si? No. I know, of course. -So, the question is. -Yes? Among the compass members, who died? Died, you say? The Compass is a well-kept secret, so how does the director know about it? Rumor has it that the director's hometown is also around here. Yes. A car is here to take us back. Sorry. Are you leaving already? Sayaka, audition in Osaka. Well then, take care. Apologies, Maria. There might have been a slight misunderstanding. In the final ending part, it seems like only Maria wasn't captured on film. There's no footage of her. Let's finish bit by bit for now. This? yes. I'm the one who killed that kid... Why are you saying that? The dialogue has been changed. I've made full modifications. How much longer will you be here? Nevertheless, my role is the one who's attacked by the culprit and escapes, right? What are you saying? You're the culprit. yes? The protagonist, yet the perpetrator. The woman you killed is the one attacking. Like a ghost. - i killed her? - Yeah. You killed the girl you were close to. Four years ago. Well then, shall we start the test shoot? I definitely killed someone. Four years ago. Compass members, The girls' compass. Because of us, they got disqualified from the competition? Exactly as it sounds. You know that. It hurts to talk about it. - You're talking about yourself. - Quiet. Is it really you? What about Bata, what about Rumi... Just leave it. still... Time's up, though. Disqualified due to such a rookie mistake. Is that my fault? A selfish play that harms others because of your own role. Other seniors know about it too, so why single me out? With such childish arguments... Childish? It's too childish. Because of your position, I know it's hard to admit a mistake. But does that mean you can twist it and make it embarrassing for a junior? Otherwise, the juniors won't grow. Kensei Theater Club, a disappointing captain. I actually want to say something to the captain. What would you say? Just that it's like that. I'm hungry. Bata, we're in big trouble. It's too late to do anything now. Is it over now? You seriously... Hey, calm down over there. Elementary students have left. You're not involved. What's with that attitude toward your senior? That's going too far. Don't get agitated. It's humiliating. The guys are scared, you see. Kusuda. You again? How many times have I told you, don't bring chaos to the Bu? Do you think I'm bad, Sensei? In the Kensei Theater Club, discipline is more important than anything else. Then, could you please tell the seniors definitely about it? What does that mean? Do I have to say it again? That's what it means. You're unbelievable! Stop it! are you okay? I've made up my mind. I'm going to create a troupe. - What? - What did you just say? I've been thinking about it for a while. Our own theater troupe. Will you guys follow me too? Then, what about the Theater Club? But all it'll do is corrupt, right? Hold on, wait a moment. Do you have a concrete plan? What about the members? And the budget? We'll figure something out for that. And what about Rumi... But you'll help, right, Bata? why me? Do you need a reason? Just trust me. Come to think of it, I'm a Sagittarius. So, I'm following Rumi, the Lion King. What's that? Anyway, do I just have to follow? Are you still angry? I'm not angry. Seniors can be kind too, you know. I don't care what happens to those people. Then why? Watami? That side is making me mad. Sensei? Whenever it's something, it's always "discipline, discipline." We're not just puppets to be controlled. We're alive! Wait a moment, calm down a bit. I want to practice more seriously in the rehearsal room. Even more focused acting. Then there's no complaint. Why's that? What are you doing? let's go. What for? - She's doing that again. - Just wait a moment. Thank you. Goodbye. What's that? We were in the same competition, right? Oh, Kensei's Theater Club? I saw your school's play. You did well, but didn't you fail a few times? We have a fair number of members and we repeat the same directing and scripting. You guys must be feeling regretful this time too. That's enough of that. More importantly, You're Edjima Ran? About the play, of course An incredible aura. You was beautiful. You radiated energy all by yourself. Twinkling and dazzling. It was overwhelming, you could say. I couldn't take my eyes off Ran. You were truly beautiful. Don't you think? Thank you. Let's continue supporting each other from now on. Hold on a moment. What are you doing? let go! Sorry. you, if you were to join our troupe, that would be great. There are only three of us right now, but doesn't something about it feel exciting? Ran said earlier, It's just repeating the same thing every year. Is practicing something meaningless like that fun? Of course, practicing might not be fun, but there's something more. There's no need to fit in with others around you, just do what you want to do. Such a free-spirited troupe. Nothing has been decided yet, but we need you, Ran. I want to do it together. It's a lot to handle, though. Busy with the theater club and part-time job, - and on top of that... - What is it? I'm not interested. I'm sorry for not living up to your expectations. Goodbye. Rumi. what are you doing? Don't say goodbye! You're lying that it's not interesting. It's written all over your face. I wrote down my number. i'll wait. Here. As a gesture of apology. Hurry, hurry. - Ran, are you okay? - I'm fine. wait! The Sinner of the Pond. Sis, where are you now? We're near the reception area. Oh, sis! Sorry, I mistook it for the outside. It's okay. Ran, let me introduce you. This is my sister. Nice to meet you. I'm Natsume Hirose. My little sister is always causing trouble. Why is that? Seeing a celebrity in person for the first time... I understand that feeling. I was also surprised at first, you know? Let's get started now. -Let's go . -Yes. Oh, Natsumi. Ohguro-san, it's been a while. long time no see. These kids were the ones who called you... Then, come to the waiting room later. Please take care of us. Wait, Megumi. Isn't that Natsumi Hirose? Don't lie. The third person from the left. It's true! It must be tough. Things are like that only in our hometown. Oh, sis. I feel like I'll fail again. I'll stick it on for you later. thank you. You seem to get along well. Because we're apart, it feels that way even more. When we were young, our parents divorced, so Kaname and I are living apart as well. Is that okay? She often seems absent-minded. Doesn't she bother you guys? Not at all. Really? Yes, really. She's very helpful. Is that so? That's good. Kaname, you always chew gum? It calm me down. My concentration improves. But the sound... It's okay, I'm being mindful of the situation. I'm sorry. For my acting unnecessary... Ohguro-san, he not usually not such of person. That's not the case. well, honestly, hearing such one-sided comments made me mad, but who would come to see a play performed by high school students they've never seen before? Ohguro-san probably wanted to say that. Rather than that, she said it quite clearly. I thought too lightly of it. Right, everyone knows, don't they? We haven't even decided on the troupe's name yet. True. I've been thinking, anything come to mind? East, West, South, North. North, South, East, West? No, not that. Then how about something ordinary? Troupe Donnai Shabe. Doesn't that sound good? It's like Mahjong. The important thing is the impact. Just like you guys are laughing now. Even among idol group names, there are plenty of strange names, right? Isn't that right, Natsume? Yeah, well... You know, why? How about a compass? Compass? It's the thing that shows the direction on a boat, right? Somehow, it sounds good. it might be good. Sorry, Rumi, I just... Rumi? Kaname! Awesome! Rumi! How long are you going to stick around? You didn't bring the script, did you? It's not that. I only received the front part... It's okay. I haven't seen the script at all either. Anyway, there weren't any lines. Wait, it's a joke, Yamato. It's a joke. What the... But still, Director, Wouldn't it be more natural if we didn't know the development after this? Right? I think so too. I purposely gave Maria bits of the script little by little. And besides, no matter what anyone says, Maria is a member of Compass. Compass? Don't you know? Around here, she was really famous. Because it's a legendary troupe, director, Shall we start? Yes. did you kill her? There is evidence left. Who on earth? There wouldn't be any evidence left... Why is this? Is this Compass's necklace? It's pretty We're starting the shoot. Okay. Compass. You've already made it? You want to let everyone know you made a play, right? Click on this necklace of Compass. - Isn't this nice? - Did you take a picture too? So you've been taking a few recently. You should've told us earlier, we would've dressed nicely. That's why I didn't say anything. If I had told you, everyone would've dressed up. A natural face is the best. Why are you like this, Ran? You were spacing out, looking at your own face just now, weren't you? No. I really wasn't. I wanted to wear pretty clothes too. Kaname is right. why? If you had told me, I would've looked like I did in the first birthday photo. - Birthday photo? - I'll take one now if you want. It's fine. Click on the Compass logo here. Okay. This is amazing. I think I'll faint from excitement. No~ It sounds real when Bata says it. But still, updating like this from time to time, even a little, is worth it. What's this blog linked here? my blog. Check it out. I made it recently, but I forgot to promote it, So not a single person visited. That sounds like you, Kaname. But still, I mean, Even here, I'll promote Compass a lot. That phrase, You really can't forget it. Don't say it with such a serious face. it's joke Your eyes are scary. Sorry. A word at this point: Do you have time tomorrow night? Why are you like this, Rumi? Why don't we do it here too? what? Lies. There's no way. I'm telling the truth. You're saying it's a lie! He hasn't sent me an email either. I wouldn't know about that. Tell it to Kimura. So you're saying that he doesn't send or receive emails or calls from you? Even if you tell me that... why are you crying? I'm the one who wants to cry. In Kanako's case, Kanako, - Kimura-kun - Sorry, I waited. Not at all. What do you want to eat? Ramen? You don't like ramen? Anywhere is fine. Wherever Kimura wants to go. Then let's have ramen. Ramen again? Why don't you like ramen? It's not that it's not good, I actually like it, but ramen... But all there is is ramen. Ramen has calories... calorie? Isn't that okay? What's wrong? What's wrong? Who is it? What's wrong? what are you doing? Unbelievable. - If you guys fight here, it's not good. - Who are you? - Who are you? - Are you okay? What's with the commotion? -Oh, really - What? dispute... - Who is it? - Who are you? Yeah? What is that old man doing! Rumi, what are you doing? I figured out the cause. What are you talking about? We didn't respond. what? So that guy thought we We're really fighting. We need to make sure this is a stage, not real. You're going to build a stage there? Yeah. But even what we make is a special space. This isn't a road here. It's not an ordinary place, I think. Can't it be on the street? It's not about that. It's about distinguishing the approach. Distinguishing the ordinary from the extraordinary. With costumes or lighting. Even lighting... If used well, this can become impressive lighting. Even just one piece of cloth is fine. By spreading it out broadly, it becomes a stage. I'll secure this corner of the cloth with this light, tie it around the stage, and... Create a rectangular frame with wire, attach red, blue, and yellow filters, Attach these lights above, to the right and left, If we have two more in the front, Exactly!y! If you hold them, they become spotlights! That's right! I'll make the costumes, Sewing is my skill. Great! So where will we practice? We can't do it in the same place, right? True... You know, what? sorry, i forgot. the sun is setting. It's particularly big today. Don't jinx it! Everyone, gather up, Ran has something to say. -I'm tired. -Are you okay? - We're almost done. - Okay. Here? here? This is incredible. We're going in here? Yeah. - Isn't it written "No Entry"? - Watch your step here. -Ran, is this okay? - It's fine. Let's go in quickly. We need to be careful here too, it's easy to bump into things. Be careful, Kaname. - Kaname, are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. Upstairs? Sorry, there's no elevator. Is it okay? spider! What's that? -A spider... -A spider? Quickly! We're here. Excuse us. Sure. Is it okay to come in freely? It's nice. I like it here. I used to live here before. It was my mom's company's mansion. But the company went bankrupt. Over there, Bringing you guys here was actually embarrassing for me. why? me. Actually, I wanted to go to Kinsei University, But our family couldn't afford it, Although we all have different problems we're facing, Each of us has worries. Ran brought us to this great practice space like this, Even if it's like a school, it doesn't matter, look at us, We came out of the drama club and We're happy that we can perform with Ran. That's right, Ran. thank you. here. thank you. I finally feel relieved. That was great! Let's give it a try! Was Ran always like that? What? Well, I was so surprised. What's going on suddenly? what are you doing? Lift this side, Turn this around, One, two, Kaname, this one, - It hurts! - Are you okay? I'm going. this doesn't fit. I'm disappointed in myself. -Ah, Mirai -Did you have a feeling about it too? What's wrong? who are you? Nice to meet you, I'm Kanako. Nice to meet you, I'm Hanae, Kimura's girlfriend. No, wait a moment. Why? Is there something you don't like? Not exactly. sorry! Well, That... I wish we could speed it up a bit more. In Bata's lines, there's that "Eh~" thing, It's better to make the "Eh~" shorter. If we speed it up too much, it won't connect with the next part. Still, it's too slow for now. I think it would be more fun to make it a bit faster. Alright, let's try it again. Yeah, let's do that. - Then, one more time. - Yeah. Alright, I think what we did just now was really good. really? That's a relief. Isn't this speed good enough? - Isn't this speed good enough? - Ah, sister. Hey, guys. I brought some snacks. Thank you. Eat a lot. -It looks delicious -We'll enjoy it. Is this the one that emits green light? Try shining it over there. Alright. Isn't it green? -really? -Bata, what do you think? -It's cute - It's fine. -what do you think? -Yeah. Fast, Kaname. This is cute, right? Where's the red? What's this? Seriously... - I'm sorry. - It's okay. We can't wear these. True, the lights aren't even on yet, but people are gathering little by little. Kaname, get gum and lipstick ready. The opening is in 10 minutes. It's okay. We practiced enough for that. It's definitely going to go well. Please take care of us. Please take care of us. Compass Theater, Where the light shines. In Mirai's case, I used to like Kimura. That's all, just that. And in Hanae's case, Everything is this kids's fault. Right, Mirai? What? -Mirai. -Yeah. You don't like Kimura, right? What? What's that? Why are you saying it like that? But you don't like him, right? Why? What's the reason? I have no idea. Kimura said so. What? Mirai seems to think of me as if nothing happened. what? He came to me crying and clung onto me. It's a lie. That can't be true. She said that Kimura likes me. Was that a lie? I don't know about that. Even if you tell me... -When? When did that happen? -About a month ago. Just the day before yesterday, I also told you that I seem to like you. Oh, and I also told you yesterday. - By mail? - Yeah. -really? - And also over the phone. It's a lie, that can't be true. It's not a lie! It is a lie! Even he doesn't send me emails. I don't know about that. Tell Kimura. So, you're saying he doesn't send or receive emails or calls either? Even if you tell me... why are you crying? If I want to cry, it's my choice. Chapter 3: In Kanako's Case In Kanako's Case -Kanako. -Kimura. -Sorry to keep you waiting. -It's fine. What do you want to eat? Ramen? You don't like ramen? Anywhere is fine. Wherever Kimura wants to go. Then, let's have ramen. Ramen again? You don't like it? Not that I don't like it, but... Actually, I like it, but there's only ramen. Ramen has calories... what? calorie? Is it not okay? Then how about udon? Udon is fine? Lower in calories and udon is also not okay? When I eat with Kimura, I can't really taste the flavors. Then udon is good, right? Since Kimura eats so well. You eats a lot, especially noodles. Right, you eats a lot of noodles. I really like that. I really like the way you eats. So, it's fun to eat together no matter what. Really? In that case, ramen. So, ramen has calories... Come on, Kanako. What is it? -what? -Who's there? what are you doing? I can't believe this. - It hurts. - What are you? -Among the two of us, who do you choose? -who? So, I... I like both Mirai and Kanako. There's no need to pick a side. We're all humans, right? Deciding who's better, isn't that degrading? Creating ranks like that is just too much. Each person has their good points, and I want to make a choice that I feel is right for me. I want to figure it out, I want to bring it out. So, which side is good and bad? It's hard for me to decide. Don't look at me like that, it's scary. It's really scary, so stop. Don't look here! Step aside for a moment! I'm really sorry. Stand up. Do you think an apology is enough? Do you think you can brush it off? Kanako? You've become numb, Kimura. If you underestimate women, you'll get hurt. That's why I'm going to hurt you. A draw? All of it a draw? -OK? -OK. A trap? one, two. But still, because I like you, I won't let you slip away. - Thank you so much for today. - Thank you. Well done! Do it again! You did it, finally. What are you saying? It's just the beginning now. You can be genuinely happy about today. I'm so happy. Thank you, everyone! Please come and see us again! Thank you. Sorry I'm late. - I'll support you. - Thank you. Looks like we have an audience. Word must have spread. There are quite a few positive posts about us on the internet now. -Ran, go change and come. - Okay. What's that over there? I'll be back in a moment. Wait, it's a shared space here, there's nothing to say, right? So what are we going to do? We can't perform like this. Could we be the target? Trying to stop us from performing? why? what did we do? I'm sorry. I... Until my parents divorced, I attended a public middle school. I was in the same class as those guys back then. They kept saying I was stupid or disgusting, I heard it over and over again. I escaped that and transferred to Kinsei. I'm sorry. because of me... Have they done anything else to you? How about that ugly and unpleasant Kaname? Smells like an idiot, makes me sick, irritating, I'm gonna die. Smells like an idiot, makes me sick, irritating, I'm gonna die. More importantly, who should kill her? You're pretending to be an actress? But no one's watching, your face is unattractive. Seriously. Die. Seriously annoying. Is this them? Die. Seriously annoying. Is this them? I don't know. Since the street performance last time, it's been like this. Why didn't you tell us sooner? Because things were going well recently, I didn't want to worry you. -Shut down Kaname's blog. -I'm on that side too... I don't want to do that, it's not all bad. There are supportive messages too. still... Let's give it a try. The first gift we've received from the audience. What's this? What's this? -Who's there? -What's this? what are you doing? I can't believe this. - It hurts. - Who are you? -Wait, what's this? -Are you picking a fight? - Oh, really? - Who's there? You of all people? -How is Miyuki-san? -She's okay. What is it? It's evidence of murder. Evidence? The woman who was murdered managed to exert her last strength and put something inside this, they say? What's inside it? I can't tell you that, Marie. What's this shooting? What kind of trap? Figure out who you killed. Don't come back without evidence. Stage Battle Festival We're going there? It's the most famous event in the city. The venue is the city's assembly hall. Over a thousand in the audience. How about it? Isn't it perfect for Compass's debut stage? Why do you ask? You see, usually, you'd discuss it first with us. I'm sorry. A person named Takemoto, a producer, suddenly contacted us, and things progressed quickly. Compass doesn't even have a name yet, so it was suddenly decided. Takemoto heard about us through word of mouth and wanted to collaborate with us. He said he even came to watch our street performances before. He asked us to participate. Mr. Takemoto said that with us, we might have a chance to win. I also like street performances, but we can't stay there forever. We need to move on to the next stage. But we're short on time. the script? We can't do costumes like we did on the street either. I'll rewrite the script properly. I'll make the costumes myself too. And the props. How are you guys? I'm not sure but I 'll help you make the costume. What about Ran? It might be a huge opportunity. What are the conditions for participating? Sell more than 100 tickets And 20,000 yen per participant Should we give it a try? Sounds good! Thanks! This is why I rely on you guys. Really... Ran, I'm talking about the participation fee. You found this place. So, I'll cover it with Compass's funds. Then, Rumi, are you getting a guarantee for directing and writing? That's... The participation fee will be covered once I receive the salary from part-time job. Don't just make me feel pathetic. Sorry, time's up, I'll head back first. Oh, I forgot too. We need to head back quickly today. Then I'll head back too. Goodbye. I'm talking about Ran, having mixed feelings might actually hurt the other person. I've been thinking about this too. Really? You see, Rumi, what is it? I've been waiting. Why are we at Kaname's place today? Sometimes, changing the location might bring freshness. Today's an important day, you know. That's true. Then I'll divide the roles. There are two works? Choose which one to do. Tunnel in the Sky Friendship Cone how was it? tell me honestly. I'm okay with either. me too. No, both won't work. which part? Both have good structure, but even if we do the same thing as before, there won't be any difference. But Producer Takemoto was interested in the street performance report. Well then, we didn't need to be out on the street. What's that? It's a matter of time... Weren't we heading to the next stage? It's time to compete with a new strategy. We need to show a different side. Should we? Isn't it the time to show the compass's true colors? This isn't about the compass. We're trying to stretch a play that's only 10 minutes long. The audience will catch on as well. Don't complain without even writing the script. I wrote it. A crossroads of life and death. crossroads of life It's amazing. It's completely different from what we were doing on the street. The compass's unique color is still there. What about Rumi? The answer is already there. I think it's amazing too. let's go with this. Let's go with that, and despite all the ups and downs, let's stay strong. Let's eat well. thank you for this food. What about the costumes? -Wait a moment. -I got it. I'm not dead, am I? Die. Just die completely. -what? -Why do you keep coming back instead of dying? Maybe it's because you have something to say? No. -There is. -No. If you don't listen, I can't get angry. tell me. -There's no way. -There is, it's possible. -Mori? -hi. Mori? Mori? I'll switch roles. My partner is Kaname. Ran will partner with Bataro. Wait a moment. Why all of a sudden? Change the image a bit. is that a lie? Partnering with me... We will reenact the play. Is Kaname okay? Then, one more time. Bata. Welcome. I'm back. Were you here? Is it true that they're performing a play in front of the station? did you enter my room? Providing support is within the scope of our activities. Do you have time for theater outside of that? You've changed recently. I don't want to hear that from mom now. -what? -Sorry. If quit now, I will cause trouble to many people. I also have a sense of responsibility. Promise me then you'll stop after this event. hello? How's it going over there? Did I make a mistake earlier? Yeah, things are going smoothly here. I'm working on it right now. Kaname, you're being noisy. You're doing it properly. Are you sure I'm doing it properly, Kaname? It's fine. Really, it's fine. Stage Battle Festival. What is it? Do you know what day it is today? Sorry. Avoiding me... I'm not avoiding you. You're lying. You're avoiding me. I Because I did that. Isn't that right? Why did I do such a thing? I don't even know why I did it. I was surprised. It's me who's surprised. I can't believe Bata thought that way. I definitely avoided it. We have no idea what to do on this side either. Tasks have piled up, but it's not the time to think deeply. Don't say that, we're about to start soon. It'll be trouble if any wounds appear. I don't say it, but Kaname knows too. Even if you try to hide it by winding your big watch. me I'm not like that. Pretending to be calm. But in reality... Me... I'm not really like this. However... Both Rumi and Kaname are stronger. What are you doing? You're strong. Strong. I don't know what's strong and weak. It doesn't matter how you appear. Bata is Bata. Because you can write such an amazing script. You're being too ambitious. let's go. Ran and Kaname are waiting. Come on, we'll be late if we don't hurry. To have your first kiss with Bataro... I mean, that's... I don't have that kind of hobby. I said no. Stop laughing and start running. Me... Actually, I might like Rumi. What's that? Don't say that. Wait a minute, it's too fast there are so many people It feels like there are over a thousand. I'm nervous. It's okay. You've been trained by Rumi enough for this. Just stick to what you've been doing. Think of the audience as rolling pumpkins. -pumpkin? -Right. Next is "The Compass Theater" The Crossroads of Life and Death. Rumi, let's do it. Everyone, as usual, Please take care of us. Please take care of us. Definitely, Something has jumped in from somewhere in my field of vision. It's not from the front. Human field of vision is about 75 degrees left and right. About 150 degrees in total. Within that wide 150-degree field of vision, Something clear and distinct has jumped in. It was human. It was a woman. On the rooftop of the building where I am standing, On the rooftop of the building across from it, the woman was standing. But it's dangerous to stand there! You're the one who's actually dangerous for saying that. What are you doing there? Whenever I try to do something, always get interrupted by someone. It was like that earlier, and it's the same now. I really wish I knew what to do, Why does this always happen? Are you okay? When asked if I'm okay, Breaking the norm of saying "I'm fine," I thought about answering "I'm not okay," But setting that aside, Still, unable to answer with "I'm fine," Naturally, I respond like this: Over there, The moon is so beautiful... moon? look at that. It feels like you can reach it if you stretch your hand. And what exactly are you doing? what? But it's dangerous to stand there. Yeah. Speaking of which, earlier I... -To be blunt, -What is it? Were you trying to die? It's not nothing. Something happened. It's nothing. Yes, there is! Then why do you have that expression? -What's going on No, there isn't! Yes, there is! Are you dead? You're dead. -What? Liar. - You're dead. why? taxi. what? You wwere running at an incredible speed. Running away? Hit-and-run? Setting that aside, The scene where you were hit and flew away was excellent. really. thank you. -And what about her? -who? The girl. Did you not see her? I didn't see her. - Oh, is that so? - Yeah. Yeah. Who are you? me? A corpse. A corpse. Look at this. I'm done for. My condolences. It's you who should be pitied. Spare me the trouble. Wait a moment? Got you. Am I not dead? die! Just die completely! Why do you keep coming back instead of dying? Maybe it's because you have something to say? No. Yes, there is. No. If you don't listen, I can't get angry. -Tell me. -There's no way! Yes! It's possible! who? Mori? Hello. We always, We always wonder Could we be slowly dying? What are you saying? What's that supposed to mean? It's okay. You don't have to think about it. Even if we don't think about it, We're still alive. I died, but Mori did too. But humans are still alive. Even without pondering the meaning of being alive, Can we continue to live? You've never thought about it, have you? I'm not living with the intention to survive. But what about it? isn't that very strange? Yeah. I'm feeling sad right now. So, if you die now, I'll be finished. What? if you die now, I'll lose everything. The time between you and me, It'll disappear completely. Even if I write in a diary, Even if I take pictures, Neither you nor I will be in them. Leaving them behind won't have any meaning. Then Takano will keep on living? Probably. I am Simply, I you I hope you don't die. i'm alive. I'm getting older too. Like Mori said, We're slowly dying. I don't want Sakai to die. It's tough. So, don't die, please. You don't have to think about surviving. Because you're alive. isn't that enough? Is that not cowardly? I'm sorry. No, it's okay. But i stabbed Morikun. -Don't worry about it. -I do. because Because I'm a murderer. I will never, Forget it. please, Don't forget. Still, it's okay. Even if you forget, I won't forget. If you're alive, surely You'll meet someone even more amazing than me. I won't meet anyone. Because by then, I'll be dead too. Stop it, don't say things like that. You're dead, aren't you? If I were something spiritual, There wouldn't be blood, right? You're alive? I just wish you didn't die. I was alive! cowardly. Why did it have to be like this For us to talk? It was scary. Me? Honestly, talking to you Was what scared me. Certainly. I also I also We should've talked Before it came to this. I'm sorry. why did you stab me? I forgot. Just say it's because of that. Because you're alive. Because you're alive. Morning comes. See you again. Take me too! It doesn't stop. shaking to this extent... I still can't accept it. Should I ask Takemoto directly? Rumi Don't you think it's strange? The loudest applause was for Compass. Even the standing ovation was just for us. But still, the result is... Then why was there so much booing during the announcement of the winner? Calm down a bit. We really make things difficult. I can't believe they went this far. Thru were supposed to compete with Basara and Mitsuko Company on this side. It was really tough, right? Booing happened, so you see. That's fine. I've been immersed in mannerism for the past 2 or 3 years, Thank you for introducing a good kids this time. Yes, those were the student of Miss. Wanatami. I'm glad it was helpful. What's wrong with you guys? What are you doing to the teacher? Quiet down! Shut up! Don't we mean anything to you? Your own Are you doing such a terrible thing selling your own students? That's too much! Stop it! Don't touch! -Don't touch! -Rumi! Don't get too conceited just because you were a bit popular on the street! You girls were introduced by the teacher... You guys are annoying! you guys are dirty! too dirty! get out! Rumi! I won't forgive you! I can never tolerate such a thing! You girls are dirty! too dirty! Sorry, girls. I got too carried away. -Don't apologize -Yes. Still, we were deceived. I wasn't fooled We might have been deceived by those guys. But the audience recognized us. We don't need awards like that. - Good job. - Good job. Is everything really okay? I called a friend earlier, and they're coming to pick me up. It's your hometown, right? Then please be careful on your way back. Enough, just close the door. Thank you for your hard work. Figure out who you killed in your memory. If you can't find the evidence, don't come back. Alright, taking the picture. One, two. Done Next. Ran, you're amazing. Well, it's because she the main lead. -Excuse me... -Yes. Can we take a picture together? Me? Alright, say cheese. thank you. - Stay strong. - Yes, thank you. Leave here right now. I'm glad you came, Ran. Don't call me by my name when we just met. Ran! What kind of habit is that? It's not the first time. Mr. Mikura When Ran was born, He come to see you. After your wife and child died in an accident, You're trying to amend Your relationship with us. Are we substitutes for your deceased family? Ran. It's okay. Your performance on the stage earlier was great. Winning wouldn't have been surprising either. Did you come to watch? The Mikura Group is providing financial support here and there to keep the city alive. That aside, I hope that street play comes to an end. There's no reason for me to hear those words from you. - Ran! Calm down. - it's okay. She's just like your younger self. I like that you're reliable. I hope Ran follows in my footsteps, even in academics... Please don't decide things on your own. A friend is attending a school that's moving. It's a really good school. They're dedicated to education, and there's a dormitory too. If Ran goes back to the drama club now, what will you do about the compass? It's not that serious. It seems like Ran was warned not to perform on the streets. They said she'd be expelled if she did it again. Even our school got contacted by the police. Watanami probably pushed this onto the school as a school-related activity. Hey, Even though the teacher went too far, you did hit him, right? Because Rumi might get expelled. Bata went to apologize to Watami. -bata. -It's okay. At that time, Watami told her to come back to the drama club. Rumi. What's with that sigh? In Rumi's case, it's not about the drama club, it's about resisting Watami, right? Get out of there reasonably. If you value the compass, come back to the club first. Considering the current situation too. Got it. Thank goodness. I won't go back to the club. -why? -Instead, I'll prepare the next script for the compass. What do you think of the dormitory? Originally, after graduating from high school, I was planning to go to Tokyo. So I was working part-time. But those plans got ruined, you see. You know, When we had the Stage Battle, didn't we get business cards? From people from entertainment agencies or something, people related to that. Producer Ohashi ?? Yes. Yes? Are you talking about a movie? Of course. Yes? An audition, right? Please take care of me. -They're talking about a movie audition? - I heard too. Amazing. -What should we do? - It's okay, I'm going too. Really? -I have to work hard . -Let's do our best. I'll tell Rumi as well. Ran is auditioning this time, so we're going to Tokyo together. Hold on. There? It's quite high. Did you see Kaname? So, before the audition started, Bata, that's enough now. After the director passed by Kaname... I'm quiting. And I'm going to recommend Ran. Quiting? But this is unfair, isn't it? That someone who didn't audition gets accepted. Kaname, Do you think I'd be happy hearing you say that? That's disrespectful to me. I did what I could. But if my personality doesn't suit, there's nothing I can do about it. I'll keep auditioning in the future. I might fall again. But I won't give up. so? What about Kaname? Be honest, considering how Ran is talking. I want to. Alright, it's decided. If you're going to do it, do it with conviction. Exactly. Don't you want to try the swings? It's been a few years, hasn't it? How did it go? Swinging back and forth like this. long time no see. Really? that girl, Her underwear was stuck in her mouth. Someone nearby found and helped her. They tried to call the police and an ambulance, but Kaname refused. So, they called me, sister? Did they call everyone? Kaname, The decoration on my shoe had fallen off too. I glued it back on. Let's go back. I don't want anyone, not even Dad, to find out. You all go back too. It's okay now. Let's meet at school again. She said she was raped. It's a lie. The internet comments are insane. The face in the nude photos has been edited to look like Kaname's~ Let's go. Goodbye. Goodbye. We'll do the movie. We'll see it through to the end properly. I mean, I will. After joining the compass, I had my first dream. Even after this movie ends, I want to keep acting. There's a lot going on. There will be many more things happening from now on. So, we can't lose to things like this. Batta! Where have you been? Sorry, I had something to investigate in the library. Why hasn't Kaname contacted me even after taking a break without saying anything? what? Who did she tell on the way back? It's not what you think. Let's meet at the station today. At the station? I got some ice cream. Let's eat. Thank you. I was worried because she didn't come, so I went to pick her up. You told you not to leave her alone. just because she's resting. She turned off her phone too. Kaname? hello? What are you talking about? Kaname? Where are you now? Kaname? say something. Kaname! Rumi? The call got cut. She was chewing gum. What should I do? The power's off again. why... Thank you. It's always been enjoyable having you all around. You've meant the world to me. This... what are you both doing? You two, go look for them quickly! Yes! High School Second-Year Student Suicide - Internet Malicious Comments Blamed On the 14th, around 5:20 PM, in Fukuyama City, a high school second-year student was found collapsed, according to a classmate... Kaname, She was wearing the outfit from the stage battle. Watami said she convinced Dad. She looked pretty. What about her face? face? even though the left side was bandaged, She still look pretty. Makeup too, that Kaname liked pale pink the light pink lipstick was applied... Let's not meet for a while. If we do, memories of Kaname will come back. the weather is nice today. She must have been quite disappointed too, having such an incredible chance right in front of her, She must have awoken something inside her. Why did I care so much? Seeing i probably irritated her. It's like looking at my past self. No matter what happens, don't quit acting. Who is it? Who is it? Stop it. let go! What happened to you? You went back, didn't you? - What should we do? - Call the police... No, I was attacked. That man suddenly stabbed himself. here. This scene isn't normal. Believe me. I was blackmailed... Who are you? You're the one who blackmailed me? wait. You see, how did it feel to kill someone? Rumi, don't be so scared. This is fake blood for makeup. The knife you have A stage prop for indoor scenes. Long time no see. All of you... In here, the evidence from the murder four years ago is actually inside. What Natsume wanted to see. I don't know. I haven't killed anyone. open it. I'll be opening it soon anyway. Open it. You want to see it, don't you? what's this? I went to a university in Tokyo and joined a small theater group I liked. I noticed when I used sound effects there, the identity of that sound. Want to hear it? listen. When that sound was created, Kaname was already dead. Right, Natsume? Did you change the face a bit? The voice sounds completely different. What happened four years ago, we know about it. Chewing gum again? Sis. What's important thing you Wanna talk about? sister? Appearing in the Kinsei theater club came after that. I was worried because she didn't come, so I went to pick her up. Then you said you were resting. just because she's resting. She turned off her phone too. You used Kaname's phone to call your own phone to make it seem like Kaname was alive. Kaname, hello? You wanted to make it look like Kaname was alive. What are you talking about? The preservative in the snacks you brought, the chewing sound we heard from Kaname, it was this. Kaname, Where are you now? Kaname! Say something. Kaname. After the phone got disconnected, we received Kaname's last email. That fake email was made by you, right? When you went to look for Kaname, you put the phone back. Calm down. It's all just imagination. No, i saw it. what are you both doing? You two, go look for them quickly! yes! The preserved snack with one torn open, that's something you wrote, right? Why would I have to kill Kaname? I helping in making the theater group too. But you weren't happy about Kaname's success. After the compass worked properly, we faced many obstacles. That was all you? Die. Seriously annoying. Instead, who killed her? Disappear. The comments left on the blog, instead, who killed her? If you die, everything will be resolved. die The complain received by the police, really? congratulations. That time, when Kaname was cast as the lead in the movie, The shoe decoration was off again. I glued it back. How could you do such a nasty thing? Are you saying I did it? Rape? It's not that difficult. As long as you have a stun gun and a man's saliva. Don't just assume things. Before that, all of you, Where did you hear about this movie? This movie is the plan of Ran's company. A subsidiary of the Mikura Group. Didn't you hear from Kaname? I'm the hidden girl of the Mikura Group. What about that script? For Director Mezaki, Bata had him revise it as written. It was Rumi who discovered Director Mezaki. All of you, you create these theatrical situations, but in the end, there's no evidence, right? There can't be any since I didn't kill anyone. Kaname left a diary on this computer. Right before losing consciousness from the stun gun, She saw your face. Kaname knew everything. Remember? That thing. I borrowed it from Kaname's father. It was in Kaname's pocket. sister... Kaname tried to cover you, the one who murdered her. Yet how could you? How could you do such a thing? And then live on as if nothing happened? We can't forgive that. What are you going to do? How much did Kaname suffer? Hey, Natsume-san. How did Kaname fall? Tell us. Can't you avoid killing? Whether it was rape or whatever it was, that girl, saying she'll do a movie, easily obtaining what I always wanted, and smiling innocently as if she doesn't even know my feelings, It was not wrong to kill her, right? Let go! now, I want to be free! We're not the ones doing this! What's holding us back is... sister... Is Mikura Group supporting this place too? Yes. Only 4 years ago? We were standing here, every year, We are there at that time. what? A girl crying in the corridor or getting console, it sounds nice. I didn't know. You know, don't you? Don't you regret it?
