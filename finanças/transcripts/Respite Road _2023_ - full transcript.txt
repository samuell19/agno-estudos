Okay, you guys can do some coloring. I'll be back with coffee. thank you. All right, I need the two of you to check, all right. If you kick her under the table again, we're gonna have. - Josh, stop it! It hurts.

Come on, no, man, we gotta go! - Come on over here, it's about your grandpa. Come on, come on, sit on my lap, like Santa Claus. - What the fuck are you doing? - Shut up. How old are you? - 15. - No way, 15? They didn't make 'em like this when I was a kid. - Leave her alone, please. Just take your stuff and go. - I think you deserve to hear something. Okay? Your grandpa is a fucking con artist. He was just making up random prices for everything we were buying, and we caught him. We called him out on it. And we told him, we're not gonna stand for your stuff. So he ran and he was gonna call the police on us! Like we were robbing him. Can you believe it? That's when my brother got angry, and he broke your phone. I'm not gonna hurt you, Penny, okay? Or your piece of shit grandfather over there. But I just wanted you to know that he's the bad guy. Not us. And if I were you, I'd tell my grandpa he needs to start running an honest business, okay? Come here. Now get the fuck off me. - Okay, gun it. - Sean, it's not gonna work. We need to put something under the wheel for traction. - Okay, I'm gonna take a walk up. I'm gonna see if my uncle's got anything lying around that might help us out. - Do you want me to do it? - No, no, I got this. - Okay. - I'll be right back. - What? - That's what I'd like to know, what the fuck was that? - Just having a little fun, man. What do we have here? Car doesn't like the mud, does it? - Not at all. - Can we give you a push? - No, thank you, but, honestly, I'm fine. My husband- - No, it's not a problem at all. Two guys are better than one. Or none in this case 'cause your husband isn't here. - Well, he should be right back, so it's no problem really. Okay, you guys really don't have to do this right now. - Hey, puppy, that's a good doggie. What kind is he? - It's a girl, and her name is Danny. She's just a mutt. - Nothing wrong with that. - Come on, man, let's go. - Okay, you ready? Okay, we're gonna start rocking it back and forth, and then when we get her going, give it a little gas, but not too much, all right? Be gentle. - Cool, you guys get it out? - Hey, honey, yeah, these guys were driving up and were nice enough to stop and help. - The fuck you gonna do with those? - You know, that is a really great question, and it's not one I have an answer to right now. Ro, I just met these guys over at Dick's. - Oh, seriously? - Yeah, your man here was gonna let that old bastard at the store steal all your money. - What? - Yeah, Dick shortchanged me. I didn't notice, but this guy, he called him out on it. It was awesome. - Got a cigarette? - Oh, yeah. You know what, I think I'm going to join you. You don't mind, right? - You got a light? - Oh, shit, yeah. Somewhere, I got it. Here we go. I'm Sean, by the way. This is my wife Rosanna. I appreciate the help, again. I should have you guys follow me around everywhere I go. - That's my brother Rick. Ricky. I'm Dave. - You guys live around here? - No. - Are you visiting? - We got some friends up there. We're gonna do a little fishing. - Oh, Laurie and Reuben. They have a cabin just up the road. - Nope, don't know 'em. - They ran a construction business out of there. - Oh, really? - Well, yeah, they've been close for a few years now, ever since the owner got sick. - Teddy? - Yeah, Teddy. My Uncle Brian, whose cabin we're at, they were best friends. - So you know Teddy then? - You can recognize him by his first name. We actually work for Wickstrom Building. Well, I mean, that was years ago, long time ago, but I mean, so we came up here, we're gonna do a little pro bono work on the cabin. You know, help the family out a little bit. We know what they been going through, and it must be tough for them, you know. - That's sweet of you guys. - That's really nice. - Yeah, you know, Ted was really nice to me, and, you know, I'll never forget it, and just felt like the right thing to do. And, of course, I wanna take this guy fishing. - Yep, fishing, it's the fucking best. - Yeah, I haven't been fishing in years. - Well, thanks so much, you guys. It was really nice to meet you. - Yeah, I mean, thanks again. Can't thank you enough. And we're just up the hill on Respite Road, so anything you guys need, you know, anything at all, you know. Stop by for a beer. - Nice to meet you. - I don't like that you talked to them people in the first fucking place, but I think they bought it. - How about that girl, huh? - That was weird. Did Brian say Laurie and Reuben would be out this weekend, too? - Yeah, they should be there cleaning out the rest of Teddy's stuff. All right, come on, Danny girl. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, uh uh, I don't want her off the leash. - Come on, she's not gonna go far. - Come on, babe. - You know, it's her favorite spot. She gets to run around free. If we keep her inside all day, that's torture. Hey, check it out. That's a trail cam. They're motion sensored, so you know, you get a sense of the wildlife in the area, see what comes around at night. - That's really cool. - Yeah. - You think we can take it down and check it out? - Well, you know, we'd have to take it inside and hook it up to a computer. It's the only way to really go through the photos and see what's on there. - Never mind, it's okay. Come on. Let's go, good girl. - Shit, this is the life, huh? Use a goddamn coaster, please. - Huh? - Use a coaster. That's what they're there for. You don't wanna leave rings on the table. - Okay, so this Susie Homemaker shit is getting a little fucking weird, Bob. - What, man? We're supposed to make it look like we're never here, remember? - Okay. Not bad, huh? How about that little wifey down the road, huh? What do you think she's doing with that guy? - I don't know. He must have something you don't. - A new hybrid of wild animal has found its way into some of the more urban areas of North America. Appearing very wolf-like, these stealthy predators have slipped unnoticed into our cities. A medium-sized carnivore howling among us is going to do very well. - We've gotta get outta here. - We are, we are getting out of here. We're going to the cabin, you know? Yeah, but no, I mean, not a weekend, for good. - Yeah. You know... I am gonna tell him. Tomorrow, FYI. - Okay. - I'm gonna walk right in there and I'm gonna say, you know what, it's been a long time coming, and I deserve a fucking raise. - Yeah, that's good. - Excuse me? - No, it's just I've heard this routine before. - What, no, fuck, Danny! Shit! Danny! Danny! Fuck. Danny. Danny! - Hey. Dan, let's go. Come on, babe. Where is she? Why didn't you wake me? Danny! - Ro, I already looked everywhere for her. - Okay, I'm going to go up the road. You go into the woods in case she crossed through there. - Sure, I'm just gonna put something on. Maybe a jacket. - Yeah, take your time. - I'm sure she'll come back. - Oh yeah. Morning. - Going out for a smoke. - Hey. You guys haven't seen our dog run up here, have you? - Nah. I mean, I just woke up, so maybe she did. You need some help looking? Come on, I'll go with ya. - You know, you don't look much like your brother. - Yeah, foster brother. Me and Dave used to hang out when we were teenagers. His moms took me in when she found out I was living on the street. I think his dad was only into it because I came with a paycheck. His mom was nice, real nice, to me. Anyway, you don't look much like your husband. - That's true. Danny! - I want a dog someday, when I have a house and a yard. - We have this really tiny apartment in the city, so she's not used to being off leash and in the woods where there are coyotes. Danny? - Goddamn it. You stupid fucking idiot. I'm never gonna hear the end of this. Not a chance. - Danny! - Damn, girl, you must run a lot. You even run when you walk. Making me realize how out of shape I'm in, trying to keep up. - Hey. - Hey, anything? - No. You know, I don't think she came up this way. How's it going? - Danny! What up? - All right, well, you were the last one to see her, so where do you think she is? - Well, I was thinking maybe we go back, we get the car, drive around a bit. - Why would we do that when she's probably out in the woods? - Yep, no, you're right. Hey, thanks for all your help. - Thanks. - No problem, good luck. It's crooked. Oh, shit! Aw, fuck. Help me get the fucking thing open, man! What the fuck are you doing? - You know, I kinda miss the place a little. - Hey, guys! Oh, sorry, sorry, didn't mean to scare y'all like that. It's okay, it's okay, come on in. I knew where the key was, so we just let ourselves in. So I used to work for Teddy. I'm Ryan Edwards. Anybody remember me? Oh, probably not. Joey, you were real little. - I'm sorry, what are you doing in our house? - Ruben, right? - Yeah. - So me and your pops was real tight, okay? I just wanted to say hello. I know he hasn't been doing too good, and we was in the area so we wanted to come by. We saw the place was empty. I remembered the moose key, so, you know, I just thought, well, that would be all right. - Listen, Teddy died almost 10 years ago. - Oh. I guess it's been longer than I thought. - Yeah, we're actually up here to finally clear the place out. We're gonna be tearing this cottage down and selling the property. - Wow, okay. - Were you in touch with him when he was sick or something? - No, no. I just been gone a while, I guess. To be honest with you, I'm looking for work, and I just thought I'd come up here and maybe Teddy, he'd still have the business going, and see if he had anything for me. - Oh, oh. Well, you know, Ryan, I'm actually thinking of starting the business back up again. You know, maybe relocating to the next town over. You know, you could give me your resume. I think I do remember you, and Teddy really liked you, so, I mean, you know, that could work out great. - Serious? Like, I mean, you... This is real? Thank you, guys, so much. You don't know what this means to me. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what the fuck are you doing? - Oh, God. - Your car keys and your wallet. - Bobby, I know these people, man. - No, you don't. They don't care about you, man. Let's go. You, too, let's go. - All right. Laurie, Joey, do whatever he asks, just do whatever he asks. - Please, don't do this. - I'm doing you a favor. These people don't give a fuck about you. They're just telling you what you wanna hear because we broke into their cabin. Give me your fucking purse. You got something for me, buddy, huh, huh? Is that it? - Yeah. - You got anything else? - No, no, that's it, that's it. - Guys, please, it's okay. Everything will be all right. - Okay. They're not gonna hurt us. They just want our money. Isn't that right? You're not gonna hurt us, are you, pal? No. - No, no, no, no, no, no, what are you doing? Fuck! Go get him, what are you doing? The fuck are you doing? - Wait, wait, wait! - Took care of that bear for ya. - We can't just leave him like this. - What, do you wanna call an ambulance? - There's another one. - Well, it's a popular area. She's got her orange on, she's fine. - Danny! - Holy shit. - Oh my God, Danny! Hi, baby, oh my God! I can't believe it! - Hey, hey! - Have you just been here this whole time? Oh my God! Did Ricky find you? - Oh, hey, looks like Laurie and Ruben made it up. - Yeah. Hmm. - What the fuck is that? The fuck? Oh, hell yeah! Fucking Merry Christmas, motherfucker! Don't drink and drive. - What was he thinking? What the fuck was he fucking thinking? Fuck, man, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! - What the fuck are you doing, Ryan? - Fuck! - Fucking fool, fucking. - Shit, shit, shit. Where's he going? What up? - You planning your escape? - What? No, man, I ain't doing nothing! What the fuck? Are you gonna shoot me now, too, huh? You gonna fucking shoot me now, too? Your own fucking brother! Why'd you have to kill those people? Why? - Look, they showed up, and I did what I had to do. - You fucked me. - I was helping you! You fucked me! You never even introduced me to those people! It's like you're ashamed of me, man! You didn't even tell 'em my name! - You're fucking crazy. I never had a chance to tell 'em your name 'cause you started fucking killing everyone! I'm fucked. I'm so fucked. - Come on, Ry-guy. This was supposed to be fun. Ry-guy! Hey, we can't be done yet! Come on, no one will ever know, if we stick to the plan! - You ain't stuck with the plan since we got up here! - Okay, that's true, that's true. But just hear me out, okay? We'll dump the car and the van, and then we'll walk back and we'll clean the cabin, man. We gotta make it look like we were never in that place, right? Hey, we're in this together. I need you, Ryan. - We out by morning. Then we're fucking done. Never wanna see you again. Just like old times. - You know, Crystal said she was all done wasting time with me. There wasn't gonna be shit. I grabbed her. I didn't mean to, man. Fucking cut me pretty good with the kitchen knife, though. She was so scared. I just wanted to hold her, you know? Quiet her down. Get that knife away from me. Guess I don't know my own strength, huh? I didn't realize how hard I was squeezing her. I just left her there. Probably found her by now. - Fuck! So that was it this whole time. Played me again. What the fuck is wrong with me? What the fuck is wrong with you? - I needed an out, and you gave me one, man! Bring you up north. You kept saying how you were gonna change things, you know? Kept talking about Teddy and how great things are up here. I wanted in on that. I wanted a clean slate. You really had nothing all along. - I had a shot and you fucked it all up, just like everything else you touch. - You had nothing, and you ain't gonna be shit, just like your big brother. - So how did the talk with Mark go? - It was good, yeah. We didn't really get into numbers or anything. Just more, it was productive. We got the ball moving. - Okay. - It was a missed opportunity. I'll try again. - Yeah. - Holy shit! - Jesus Christ! - No, but I am better looking, though. - You guys scared the shit out of me. - I thought you heard us coming up the driveway. - So, what's up, guys? - Just wanted to come by and borrow some sugar. Sorry, you folks, I know it's really late. We're cooking some brownies, and we realized we were out of sugar. - Yeah, we must have some. - See that, they got some. Hey, hey, hey, it was a joke, all right? Just doing that neighborly thing, you know? Like, hey, can we borrow some sugar, right? Actually, we were heading out, and wanted to take you up on that beer, you know, if the invite is still open. - Oh, yeah, absolutely. You want one, too, Rick, was it? - Ricky! - Hmm? - You want a beer? - Fuck yeah. - All right. What the fuck? You drank the whole thing. So where's the pup? - She has a way of getting into trouble. She likes to run into the woods, and that's exactly what she did today. Spent half the day looking for her. Thanks for that, by the way. - Yep. - Maybe Mommy needs to get herself a little hamster. - Couldn't help but overhear you guys talking about Danny being on lockdown. You know, it's whatever the boss says. - Sounds like he's not the only one on a short leash. - Look, I just don't want her going out into the woods. - You know, it is for the best. Few years back, we had another dog Linda. Unfortunately, she got dragged into the woods by a pack of coyotes. - Y'all should be worried about coyotes. They like to pretend they're something they're not to fuck with you. Just like people. You can't trust 'em, and they lie to get what they want. Did you know that coyotes will send one out from the pack to make friends with your dog? They'll run around and play, have a great time, when, really, coyote's just leading him right to a trap. Next thing you know, poor, stupid mutt is surrounded, and they just fucking rip it apart. - I'm done talking about this. - So, how's everything going at Teddy's? You guys got a lot more work to do? - All done. Moving on to the next job tomorrow. What, what's the matter, big guy, hmm? - Get the fuck off me, Bobby. Don't push me, man. - These guys have to go. - Don't fucking push me. - That's good for you guys. You know, finding work. It's been real hard out here for everyone, so. - I'm gonna go up to bed. - Come on, is it something I said? - No, just tired. Can you clean up, please? - Good boy. - Yeah, okay. I'll be right up. - You gonna be in the doghouse, you don't get in there. Give me a smoke. - Fuck you. - No. - You know, it is getting late, so I should probably call it, too. - Get in there, man. - Yeah. - Give me a fucking smoke or what? Whoa, you got a hot tub, man? - Yeah, yeah, we do. - That's fucking nice. - All right, guys, step back, it's gonna get smokey. Well. So. - Nice catch. - What have you guys got going on after this? - What the fuck, man? - All over you. - You know, guys, I hate to cut the night short, but it's been a hell of a day. You know, I'm a little fried. You can finish that beer if you want, but I'm just gonna clean up a little bit and then- - Get that fire going again. - Again, man. - You know, it was good to see you guys. Best of luck on the new job tomorrow. - I think he wants us to leave, Dave. Hey, can we get one for the road? - You know what, those are yours. Have at 'em. - I don't like those guys at all. - Yeah, I know, hon. - No, they're super sketchy, and who knows if they even did work at that cabin or worked for Teddy at all. - I wouldn't go that far. I mean, Laurie and Ruben are up here, Ruben- - You're seriously defending them right now? They're lying through their fucking teeth, Sean. - Ro, keep your voice down. They might still be out there. - Oh my God. You have to tell them to leave right now. - This is the fucking life, huh? Good stuff, huh? Told you we should go on vacation, man. Fucking this is the life. - Vacation? Motherfucker said vacation. - We're away, man, that's all that matters. - We're in someone else's hot tub. - Who gives a fuck, man, huh? It's our hot tub now. I can hold my breath for fucking almost 30 seconds, bro. - I'm timing it, oh, fuck. Party's over. Get up, get up. - Are you kidding me? No offense, but what the fuck? I said goodnight to you guys three times. Three times! Can you please just do me a favor and go home? - "Come on, I said goodnight to you three times! "Why are you guys still here? "I want you guys to leave." - You sound just like him. - I'm just trying to have a nice evening with my wife, okay? I'd just appreciate it if you guys gave me a break. Why not? - What the fuck you doing, man? Shut up. - If you two don't get off my property right now, I'm calling the fucking cops. - Whoa. - Ro, Ro, it's all right. - We gotta go. - No, it's not. They've overstayed their welcome long enough. You were never welcome. You just strolled over, unannounced, invading our privacy. - Ro- - Look, I asked you nicely, and now I'm telling you, get the fuck out of here. - Hey, hey, hey, just take it easy, huh? - Right here. - Just having, we're having fun. - Yeah, we were, too, before you two animals showed up. You're rude, we don't even know you. Who knows what you're really doing up here. - What? - Just leave now! - What are you gonna do, huh? You gonna call the cops? - I will if I have to. - You sure you wanna do that? - Look, everybody just calm down. Nobody's gonna call the cops. We don't even have cellphone reception up here. Oh God, Jesus Christ. - What the fuck? - Fuck. - Look, guys, guys, look, this whole night, this whole situation, it's just gotten out of hand, and I think it's time we say goodnight. - Okay, goodnight. - Please. - What the fuck you doing, man? - You gotta help me, I can't see shit. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on. Wait, wait, wait. You gotta help me, man. I can't even fucking see. Wait, wait, wait, wait, okay. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, fuck. Shit. - Is that yours? - Hey, man, hey, my bad. - Yeah, no, yeah, it's fine. - My bad. - It's fine. - I'm really sorry. - Yeah, no, you're good, it's fine. Thank you, guys. - You're a lucky lady. Really, really lucky. - Where do we go? - We're going. - Moose Lane? - Ricky, Ricky, Ricky. - Goodnight, fellas. - Thank you. - You tell them our cellphones don't have reception up here? What, are you insane or stupid? - I just wanted them to leave. - Yeah, I did, too, that's why I threatened to call the cops. - Well, I didn't want them to feel threatened. - You didn't want them to feel threatened? Why don't you ever stand up for yourself or your wife, your fucking family? - Fuck this shit, man, it's clean. - Keep scrubbing, motherfucker. - You know, we could use some seltzer. - Told you, I just wanna make sure this fucking shit is cleared up. So come on, put the- - It's fucking fine, man. - Nah, let's put these... This'll work. Let's dump this shit on here. - Can't see shit, man. - Ro! - Look at this, it looks like- - Ro! - What the fuck? - Ro! Hey, guys, guys. You seen Ro around? - Ain't seen her. - You sure? She went for a run this morning. She usually comes right through here. We were hoping to be on the road by now, so. Okay. Thanks anyway. No, no, you know, I gotta say this. I'm sorry, but, with all due respect, last night, come on, guys. I'm trying to have a relaxing evening with my wife. You guys just show up out of the blue. This guy was clearly shit-faced already, and then you're pounding beers, and you're overstaying your welcome by a mile! And then you get into my hot tub, and then you throw up in the hot tub? I mean, that wasn't cool! - Why don't you shut your bitch mouth? Wasn't cool? Do you know what I was gonna do to you last night before this cocksucker decided to toss his cookies? You should be thanking him. He saved your fucking life. - No! No! What the fuck are you doing? - You did something to her! Where is she? - No, no, no. Fuck! - Get out of my way! Get out! - No, no! - Stand back, move it! - Fuck you! - Stop it, what are you doing? - Oh, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait! Oh, what the fuck? Wait, no! Bobby, no, no! - Fuck you. - What are you doing? - Guess you didn't feel it fall out. Just getting rid of all the evidence. Oh, fuck. Ro! - You've gotta help me, please! These two guys attacked my husband up the hill, and I- - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Two punks came in here yesterday, robbed me, messed up my store, smashed my phone. - Do you have a cellphone? - Probably the same two guys you're talking about. - Do you have a car? - No, I don't have a car. - Is there anybody else here who can help? - I cannot help you. - They are coming! - Penny, lock the door. - Ro! Fuck. Ro! Ro, come on, I ain't gonna hurt you. Let me in! - No. - Let me in! - You are a fucking liar! - No, no, no, no! - I saw what you did! - No, come on, that was all Bobby, I swear to God! I didn't kill that family, he killed that family, all right? I was protecting Sean. I had nothing to do with any of this. My brother is- - You're just like him. You are, no, you're just like him! - No, I'm not! - Get out of here! We called the cops, all right, they're on their way. - Good, great, I've never been happier to hear that in my goddamn life! Call the cops, please! We'll go, we'll go get your car. - No way I'm going with you. - Then we'll go right to the police, okay? - I don't care- - I will not hurt you. - I don't care what you have to say. - Trust me. - I don't believe you, all right? - Come on! You gotta let me in! What the fuck is wrong with you? Fuck! I'm coming in! - I'm gonna get- - Get off of me! No! - No, no, no, no. - No! Stop, stop, stop it. - Shut up, fucking stop fighting me. - Please, I'm pregnant, I'm pregnant. - You fucking goddamn fucking motherfucker! Fucking goddamn it! Fucking bitch! Ow! - Ro. Don't do it, please. Just give me the gun. We're okay, we're okay. We're okay, okay. All right, sir, I've got two units heading there right now. They should be there in about five minutes. You did the right thing. - Thank you. - Get away! Get away! Get away! Get away! Get the fuck away from me! Get the fuck away, come on! ♪ How does it feel ♪ ♪ To be underneath your skin ♪
