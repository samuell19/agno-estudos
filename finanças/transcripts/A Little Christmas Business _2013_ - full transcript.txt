(glass breaking) (light, symphonic music with violin) - Merry Christmas! * 'Tis the season to be jolly * Fa la la la la, la la la la Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas. - Mommy, they have toys in that store! Please, can I go? - Gabey, I don't want you walking around by yourself tonight, okay? Plus, I've gotta be at work in about 45 minutes. So, we just can't, okay? - Please! I'll be quick! - Okay. Well, five minutes, alright? But we have to go after that. - Yes! Five minutes. Got it. No later. - Uh uh. What else? What else? - Mom! - Come on! - David, breakfast is almost ready! Make sure you're all washed up. Yeah, mom. I'm coming. ("We Wish You A Merry Christmas") And you better not be rattling those presents again. - Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas. (phone ringing) Ya. Yes, Mom. Yeah. Uh huh. I'm gonna be there in about 30 minutes. Uh huh. No, Mom. I promise, I'm on my way. I'm gonna be there in 30 minutes. Mhm. Okay. All right. Love you too. Ugh, that tastes terrible. - Looks like you're up, son. - God is great, God is good. And we thank Him for this food. Amen. - Amen. Now, pass me the toast. - Don. - What? What'd I say? I'm only kidding. You know, I thought maybe I'd take David with me this morning. - Don, I told Davey last night, if he didn't get his homework done, no trips. - Did you get your homework done, son? - No, but Mom, I will. - See, he will! I'll tell you what. - I told him everyday this week, though, and it's just-- - Okay, okay, okay. Tonight, I will personally sit with him and help him finish his homework. - Don. - I'll tell you. Here's what we'll do. I'll take him with me, I'll get these contracts signed, It won't take very long. We'll get back here, we'll pick you up, and we'll all go to the game together! - Game. - Babe, I told you. He's got a baseball game at the Y. - All the guys are depending on me. I gotta go. - Please! - Please! - (laughs) All right. But tonight, homework. Got it? - Got it, yeah. - Got it. So, what about church tomorrow? Reverend Jones has a lovely sermon for Christmas and I thought it'd be nice for the whole family if we-- - Babe, Babe. I can't go to church tomorrow. I already told you have a business meeting in Atlanta. I'm gonna be back on Monday so I'm home in time for Christmas on Tuesday. - Don, I would remember if you told me about Atlanta. - I could've sworn I told you about it. - Are you ever gonna slow down? - Babe, I got a boss breathing down my neck. Five guys positioning themselves to take my job. I realize, I hear you, "Spend more time with the family." I know it's really important. Look! Look at this. We're sitting here. We're having breakfast right now, aren't we? Okay. - Okay. - All right. Holy smokes, let's go. Boy, that's to go. To go, to go, to go. - Bye Mom! - [Don] Bye, babe! - Love you, guys. - Where are we going, Dad? - Downtown. We gotta stop at Grandma's first, though. - Oh boy. - Yeah, oh boy. (phone rings) Hello? - I don't want excuses, Collier, I want results. Results that don't take the better part of the day. - Yes, Mr. McAlbright. - Where are those numbers on the Johnson account? And how come you haven't gotten me that purchase order for the O'Malley account? - Yes sir. - You are a worthless waste of space! (phone slams) - He is a little uptight. (soft music with guitar) Hey. Wipe your feet. Ma! Hey Ma! - My boys! Why didn't call me and tell me you were coming over? - Ma, you called me this morning. - You're such a fibber (laughing). I haven't seen you in a month on Sundays. And my grandson. - We stopped by because we're having Christmas dinner at our house on Tuesday. - It's on the calendar. Tuesday. I'm bringing a special surprise. Unbaked fruit cake. - David, did you hear that? Grandma's unbaked fruit cake! - Oh boy. - Donny. Are you spending more time with your family and less time at the office? - Yeah, Ma. I'm trying. - Your dad. Rest his soul. He spent too much time at work. And he always regretted it. - Ma, I know. Listen, we only dropped by for a quick second. We gotta run. - See what I mean? Always on a run. - Give your grandma a kiss goodbye please. - Don't forget! I'm gonna be bringing that special Christmas fruit cake! - Dad, do I have to eat the fruit cake this year? - No, son. I wouldn't want you to break your teeth. - Dad? - Yes, son. - Did you like all your teachers? - Well, I guess you could say I liked all of them. Why? - Old Lady Jones is why. - Old Lady Jones? I thought you liked her. - She don't like me. - Well, I think you might improve your odds a little bit if you called her Miss Jones. - All right. - Pretty tough on you, huh? - She's tough on everyone. - Well maybe she thinks that by being tough on you kids, she might get better results. Old Lady Jones. - Miss Jones. - There you go. Old Man McAlbright. I know how you feel. ("Jingle Bells") All right, bud. I gotta get these papers signed. I'll be about five, 10 minutes. - All right, Dad. - Stay in the car. - Okay. - Stay in the car. (car beeps) - Merry Christmas! Hey. (laughs) - That the way they're wearing them these days? - What's that? - The lid. - What? - (chuckles) Never mind. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - Excuse me, sir. - Hey, no problem. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. (slow droning music) (clock chiming) (soft rock music) - Well, Christmas is just two days away, folks. That's not much time to stuff the stockings and wrap the presents. It's crunch time. The countdown has begun, so, pretty soon, Santa will have made his appearance or lack thereof, moms will unveil the succulent Christmas goose, or it'll be time for Grandma to start torturing us with one of those annual fruit cakes. So, here's another Christmas carol for you, kiddos, to keep that Christmas spirit right. Can I help you? - [Don] I fell down and bumped my head. - Oh, yeah. You sure did. Here, come in. Sit down. What happened? - You know, I, I've never fainted before. - (laughs) Yeah, well, there's a first time for everything, right? - Yeah, I guess. - You got quite a bump on the ol' noggin. J.D. Smith. - Don Collier. J.D. the DJ? Wow. - Yeah. Pure coincidence. So you got business here in the building, Don? - Yeah. I've gotta get these papers signed. - Oh, who are you looking for? - William Baxter. - Yeah, he's in the building. But first, you gotta see the nurse. - [Don] No, I don't need to see-- - I'm sorry, policy. She's gotta check you out. - Well, I guess we gotta cover our own-- - [J.D.] Interests. - That's one way of putting it. - Hey, look. I'm supposed to walk you all the way there myself, but maybe we could breach protocol this one time 'cause I'm kinda chained to the microphone. - Cross my heart. - Out the door, to your left, last door on the left. Nurse Jenny. You're gonna love her. Get that head checked out, man. - [Don] Yeah. It was my pleasure to meet you, man. - Hell yeah. Be cool. (soft music with acoustic guitar) - Did he say right, or left? - Or up or down or back or forth? I'm sorry. I couldn't resist. Linda. - [Don] Don. - Okay. What'cha looking for? - Uh, nurse. - Oh yeah, a bump. Or bruise. It's more like a bruise. - I haven't seen it yet, but it feels like an owie. - Owie? Owie? I like that. Follow me, Don. You are going to love Jenny. It's almost worth a little bump or a bruise just to get to talk with her for a while. - This is an interesting building. - Oh, how do you mean? - Well, so far, everyone I've met has been so nice. - Well, what can I say? We do pride ourselves on it. We're here. - Oh. - Merry Christmas, Don. - Linda. Are you, uh, you sure you won't come in with me? - (laughs) Scaredy cat! You don't like those in the medical profession, huh? - Well, no, it's not that. It's just that... You've been so nice, too. - Oh. Come on, scaredy cat. The truth is out. Knock knock, Jenny. What are you doing? - [Jenny] I'm just hangin' around. Help me outta here. - How to get out of here? How did you get down there in the first place? - Oh, Linda. Well. What'd you bring me, Linda? - Well I brought you a first class, grade A, number one patient. - Oh, patients are my specialty. Hmm. So how'd you get that? - Oh, it was six against one. I whipped them all. I just ended up getting this little scratch. - Oh. You fell down, huh? - Pretty much. - Come on in and sit down. - Looks like you're in good hands, Don. And Jenny, I'll see you hanging around. - Linda, thank you so much. You're very kind. - Well actually, I'm mean as a crocodile. You just caught me on a good day. Right, Jenny? (laughs) Have fun. - Such a sweet girl. - [Don] Yeah, sure is. - You're Don. Don who? - Don Collier. - Oh my goodness. - What? - Dandy Don Collier! - No one's called me that since... - Grade school? Grover Elementary? - Miss Smith! The school nurse, Miss Smith? - How are you doing, Donny? Oh, the years have treated you so well. - You don't look like you've aged a day since I was in third grade! - Well, as I recall, you were quite the little fibber back then. And you obviously haven't changed a bit. - No, I'm not kidding. You look amazing. - Well, I do try to keep my chin up. Now tell me about yourself. I bet you're a family man. - Yeah, I've got a beautiful wife. Way outta my league. And the cutest 10 year old boy you've ever seen. I was gonna bring him with me today, but mama thought it would be best if he stayed home and finished his homework. - Nothing is as important as family. So, go on. I know you're busy but, think of your old buddy every now and then. - I can't tell you what a thrill it's been seeing you again. You were a little part of what made me me. - That bump will be just fine. - Oh, uh. Baxter. William Baxter. - Just down the hall, sweetie. - Okay. - Oh, I almost forgot. I forgot the release form. Uh, it just says that I can do what I did, and you won't get mad if you get a headache. - Ha. - At least something like that. - Sign my life away, huh? - No, you're signing up for life. - Thanks again, Jenny. (knocking) - [Man] Yes? - Mr. Baxter. Don Collier from Sebring and Sebring. Mr. McAlbright sent me over to grab a couple signatures. - Don Collier. Donny boy! (laughs) You old slug! Look at you. Don't you recognize me? Billy Baxter. Billy boy. Senior year. - Billy? - I can't believe it. Billy boy? How you been? - Donny boy. The scourge of Haleyville High. Sit down, sit down, sit down. - [Don] Yeah. - What'd the other guy look like? - (chuckles) Like the floor. I fell down. - Oh, man. I was hoping for some drama. Like it was six against one and you got the best of 'em. - Ah, those old rough-house days are over, my friend. - Oh man. You used to be pretty handy with those mitts. Haleyville High boxing team. - How you been? I mean, it's gotta be like 20 years now. - More like 20-something years. - I heard you moved. - Yeah. In a way. But I'm back now. What about you? - Well, wife, kid, good job, nasty boss. - I heard. Mr. McAlbright over at Sebring and Sebring. (mimics scared utter) If you looked up the word nasty in the dictionary, there's be a picture of him. - But having a family makes it all worthwhile, huh? - Amen. - You needed a John Hancock on that? - Yeah, yeah. Just need a couple signatures. - With pleasure, my brother. - You know, hey. I'd love to get together with the families and catch up some time. - Yeah, sure. Why not? - Kid? - Yeah, son. 10. You? - Never married. - Aw, that's all right. You got all the time in the world. - Yeah. All the time in the world. Oh, hey, listen. I don't mean to lengthen your day, but, see this line right here? - Yeah. - You're gonna need another John Hancock on that line. - You're kidding me. - Mr. Snell. Gordon Snell. - You know what office? - Actually, I'm not even sure if he's on this floor. - Lot of good you are. Hey, I'm not kidding about getting together with the families. You still bowl? - Oh, not for the longest time. - Oh, good. I'll stand a chance against you. Good to see you, bro. - [Billy] Good to see you too. - [Don] Yeah. - Not you again. Did you get your signatures? - I got one. - You need more? - Gordon Snell? - (laughs) Oh, Dear Old Mr. Snell. - You know where? - Follow me, my followee. Hi, Coach. - Hey. Hey. Dandy Don Collier. Don't you recognize your Old Sledge-hammer? Just 'cause I'm wearing a sport coat. - Coach? Coach Morris? - (laughs) It's a good thing you came around. I'da had you on the ground doing 20! (laughs) - Coach Morris. I'm sure you know Linda. - Oh, we've known each other for an eternity. - And for an eternity to come, I'm sure. - Amen to that. - Coach, what have you been doing? - Well, I kinda got out of coaching biz. - Well, great I'm glad to hear that, Coach. - Well, suffice to say, I got kicked up the ladder. - Good for you, Coach. Glad to hear you're doing well. - And you, Donny. What are you doing? - Well, I'm a husband, father, and a miserable employee of Sebring and Sebring. - I've heard about their environment. Got a cat up there named McAlbright? Real piece of work, that boy. - I report directly to him. - (groans) My sympathy is with you, son. But, things being what they are, we, still can out on our priorities. - And priorities are family and friends. Right, Coach? - Amen to that. Well, the Old Sledge-hammer's got to run. It's good to see you, Donny. - Good to see you too, Coach. Merry Christmas. That's odd. - What? - Well you're about the only person in this building that I don't know already. - Are you sure about that? It's off to Mr. Snell's office. Oh, looks like you're gonna have to wait on Mr. Snell. - I can't believe this. - Well, there you go. In a hurry again. - I've got an impatient boss who's waiting on some signatures, a son who wants me to take him to the ballgame, and a wife who's accusing me of not spending enough time with the family. - Is she right? - Probably. - Hey, I'll tell you what. It's noon. Gotta wait an hour anyway. Let's go to lunch. - Okay. - Great. ("Jingle Bells") - Are you home? Mom? Mom? - Back here, dear. Making the unbaked fruit cake for my boy. Can't let him down! - That's wonderful, Mom. - Did we have an appointment? - We were gonna do a little last minute shopping. Don't you remember? - Oh, for goodness' sake. I don't know where my brain is. Just give me a minute. (slow music with acoustic guitar) That's Donald and me, and our baby girl. She was such a sweet girl. - I know, Mom. - Donald Sr. worked too hard. It's much of the reason that we don't have him anymore today. It was always my Christmas wish that he would just slow down. But, no. - I have the same Christmas wish, Mom. - Shall we go? - We shall. - And now in our on the hour news update, still no breaks in the case of the three local kidnappings. Youngsters Joey Cox, Tim Miller, and Gabe Dawson, each 10 years of age, were all abducted in separate incidents over the past four months. We pray for their safe return. And if you have any information regarding these crimes, please contact your local police department. And now, more sounds of the season, right here on WPRK radio. (clicks) - It's a shame about those boys, huh? - Can you imagine the families? - Hi, Mary. - May I help you? - [Linda] I'll just have the BLT and coffee, please. - Sir? - I'll have the same and water will be fine for me. She had a strange energy. - Oh, Don, you have to understand. She's the mother of one of the kidnapped boys. Gabe Dawson. - That's terrible. - Been missing seven weeks now. - It's so close to Christmas, too. - Mom, I think this'll be perfect for Don's office. Don't you? - I like it. I think he'll like that. - Blue has always been his favorite color. - Yep. - That settles it then. - [Man] Can I help you ladies? - Yeah, I think we're gonna take this. - Our cashier will be more than happy to help you. - Okay. Thank you. - That gon' be it today? - I think so. - All right. Will that be cash or charge? - [Kathy] Charge. - Okay. - Do I know you? - Of course you do! I'm Santa Claus! Merry Christmas. - That was about the best BLT I have ever had. - Well, good. Next time, we'll get the chili cheesesteak. It is out of the world. - Well, I trust you. You haven't steered me wrong yet. - Ah ha! - Can I get you anything else? - Uh, no. Here. Keep the change. - Thank you. - [Don] You're welcome. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - [Linda] Merry Christmas, Mary. That was a very, very nice thing to do. (bells chiming) - Hey. What happened to your other hat? - What do you mean? - I just saw you in the other building. You were wearing a totally different hat. - No, man, I just work the north side of Pacific Street. Sorry. Wasn't me. - (laughs) Santa just went into the men's room. - I'll tell you what. If that Philly cheesesteak is half as good as the BLT, I might just become addicted to Downtown. - We haven't even talked about the dessert menu. Oh, trust me. You don't want to miss it. - Let's not even go there. I'm packing on a few extra pounds as it is. - Oh, goodness. Don't talk to me about the pounds. - Over here. After you. - Ah, listen it's, it's quittin' time for this girl. - You get off work at noon? - Sorta. But it was a real pleasure to meet you, Don. And I want you to know I love you. - I beg your pardon? - I said, I love you. Always have. - Um. - No, no, no. No buts. Good luck with Mr. Snell. Merry Christmas, Don. - Oh, sorry. Do you need your check? No, I left some money. Can I sit for a minute? - I just don't know what I'll do if I don't get him back. - You will. I know you will. - How do you know? - I'm Santa Claus and I know. It's all about believing. (knocking) - What can I do for you? - I've got some papers that require your signature, Sir, from Sebring and Sebring. - Well I'll be. - I beg your pardon? - If it isn't the guy that tried to steal my girlfriend in high school. - Your gir-- Gordon Snell? Gordon Snell. What are you talking about? You took my girlfriend to the senior prom! - Your girlfriend? - Everybody at Haleysville High knew I was going out with her. - I had been dating her for months. - I was dating her for months. - Oh, yeah. You were one of the cool ones. The athletes. The boxing team. Luckily, Cindy had enough sense to go with brains instead of brawn. - I wouldn't say that, Gordon. I'd put my grade point average up against yours any day. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, I would. - Yeah? - Yeah! - Yeah? - (chuckles) What are we doing? That was a long time ago. We're grown men now. Come to think of it, she wasn't all that anyway, if you know what I mean. - Oh. Well, you see I made that little lady my wife. - Oh. Look, I didn't know that. I'm sorry. No, seriously. I apologize. - Don't bother. Here's your signature. And I will be having a discussion with Mr. McAlbright about your attitude. - [Don] Look, I-- - No. - I'm sorry. I didn't... (phone rings) Great. Yes, Mr. McAlbright. - I trust you have those signatures, Collier. Since it is after one o'clock. - No, sir, actually, I'm delayed because Mr. Snell was at lunch. - I don't want excuses, Collier, I want results. - Yes sir. - Now listen, something's come up. I want you back here in the office within the hour. I wanna go over that Davidson file before you fly off to Atlanta tomorrow. - But, sir I, I'm supposed to take my son to a ballgame. My wife's gonna come along. You know, it's a family type thing we had planned. - I said I don't want excuses, Collier. Now get back here to the office, within the hour! (phone clicks) - Yes sir. - Hey. Hey, dude. - First of all, it's Sir. Not dude. Secondly, what do you want? - Sorry, sir. It just looks like you could use a cold one. - What's a boy like you doing talkin' about booze? - What booze? I meant a soda pop. - Actually, that sounds pretty good right now. What are you doing here? - I'm the paper boy. - Well, where's your papers? - All delivered! - Yeah? - Yeah. - All right. Where would I go about getting myself a cold soda? - Right below this floor. It's the Quarter Pub. - All right. Thanks. - No sweat. I'll be seeing you. - Yeah, yeah. I'll see you around. - Merry Christmas. * 'Tis the season to be jolly * Fa la la la la, la la la la Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Thank you so much, ma'am. - A little diversion from the norm, huh? - What? - Oh. Nothing. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, sir. Happy holiday! Nice to see you. Merry Christmas. - Mom. Mom, are you all right? - I'm coming, dear. - It's good to give, you know. If you give at Christmas, they say, all your Christmas wishes come true. I'll try to make that happen for you. - Merry Christmas, Santa. Thank you. - [Man with mustache] What can I get for you, bub? - Uh... Soda, anything diet. - Drink it slow now. We don't want any trouble around here. You look like a man that just dropped an anvil on your toe. - I wish it were that simple. - [Man with mustache] Life trouble? - Boss trouble. - Even worse. You want some advice, son? Fire your boss. - What? - I said, fire your boss. - You mean quit my job? - That's another way of putting it. - Well, I mean, I have a wife and a son, and a mortgage and bills to pay. - Things always have a way of working themselves out. - Look, brother, I don't know what planet you're from, but it's not the same as mine. - Let me ask you something. Are you going to church tomorrow? - Um. I've got this, uh, business thing I have to do in Atlanta. - I rest my case. Look at me. Things always have a way of working themselves out. ("We Wish You a Merry Christmas") - Hey dude. I mean, sir. - Hey. - You wanna buy a paper. - No, kid, I don't wanna buy a paper. - Sheesh, don't kill the messenger. - Hang on a second, kid. I'll take a paper. - Cool. - You know I used to paper route when I was about your age. - Yeah? - Yeah. Yeah, me and this buddy of mine. We used to hock these babies. Made a killing. Is there a flower shop around here anywhere? - Yeah, just right down the street. - Okay, thanks. - Welcome. - (laughs) These are so old. - There. I think we're officially ready for Christmas now. - What would I do without you, dear? I think I hit the jackpot when I got you for a daughter-in-law. - I didn't do too bad in the mother-in-law department either. - Oh! I've got something to show you. I was fiddling around on the computer the other day... My two precious children. Together. She was only seven when she passed away. This is her just before. This is Donny at the same age. He never got to meet her. You think he'll like it? - Oh, Mom. I know he will. - [Woman] Could I help you with something? - Yeah, I was thinking about... Gina? - Donny Collier. Just gonna stand there or are you gonna hug me? I never thought I'd have your arms around me again. - Me either. Gina, you ever wonder what happened to us? - Life. - Yeah. Life. - Speaking of... - Oh, a wife and a little boy. - And a few gray hairs. - Life. Gina, I heard what happened to your husband and your child and I... I just wanna say how sorry I am for your... How sorry I am that I never reached out to you. - Oh, it doesn't matter. It doesn't get any better. So, what's the occasion? - Oh. I'm a little in the doghouse with the Mrs. - Ooh, that's tough. You can't go wrong with roses. - True. You're a wise woman. Yeah, I'll take a dozen of these and can you have them delivered to 5 Maple Street? - On the double. Now just go ahead and fill out the card, and I'll fill out the bouquet. - Okay. Gina, you look amazing. - College and romance were a long time ago. You can't fool Mother Nature. (knocking) - [Mr. Snell] Come in! - Gordo. - Hey, Billy, what's up? - The Collier file. Did he see you? - Yeah, he came by. I signed it. - Yeah, so did I. - Figured we ought to give him at least what he needs for work. - (exhales) Man he was uptight. - Not the Donny I used to know. - [Nurse Jenny] Hey guys! - Hey, Jenny. - Hey, Jenny, what have you got? - I got Donny's release form and it's been okayed. - So he signed it? - Didn't even read the fine print. - Well the signature's the important thing. - And the okay. (knocking) - [Coach] Hey boys. - Hi, Coach! - Hey, Coach! - Jenny. Listen, you guys been working on that Sebring and Sebring thing? - [Billy] Case in progress, Coach. - Good, good. - Hey, dudes! - No. - No. - We don't want any papers. - We don't want any papers. - Sheesh. (daunting music) - Gina? Gina? Gina, I'm, I'm a little confused. I could've sworn that I read in that report that your entire family was killed in that wreck. Your entire family, including you. Gina? - Oh, hi. I guess I was so wrapped up in the flowers, I didn't even notice you. - I was talking to Gina out front. She came back here to arrange a bouquet of flowers for me. - Are you talking about Gina Adams? - Yes. - Sir. I'm afraid you're mistaken. Gina was involved in an accident with her family couple years ago. None of them came through. - But. I know. I mean, I remember reading that too. But I just talked to her right out front here. - Sir, I'm sure you did. Probably many times. But I am the new owner. I worked for Gina. She was a lovely person. But she's deceased. - No, no, listen. This doesn't make any sense. None of them are making any sense. - What do you mean, sir? - I mean it just doesn't make any sense. I know I saw her. It doesn't any sense! None of it makes any sense! - Sir, let me call someone for you. (soft rock music) - [Nurse Jenny] Dandy Don Collier! - [Don] You don't look like you've aged a day since I was in third grade! I know I read she was dead. I know I read she was dead. They had a funeral. I didn't even go to it. - [Linda] Priorities are family and friends. Right, Coach? - [Coach] Amen to that. - [Billy] Never married. - [Don] That's all right. You got all the time in the world. - [Billy] Yeah. All the time in the world. - I want some answers right now. - [Coach] Oh, we've known each other for an eternity. - [Linda] And for an eternity to come, I'm sure. - [Coach] Amen to that. - [Don] You know I used to paper route when I was about your age. - [Jimmy] Yeah? - [Don] Yeah. - [Linda] And I want you to know, I love you. - [Don] I beg your pardon? - [Linda] I said I love you. Always have. (soft rock music) - What's going on here? - What do you mean? - I met you earlier, right? - Yeah, I told you to get that bump checked out. - [Don] And then you sent me to the house nurse. - House nurse, are you crazy? There's no house nurse here. - What? - In fact, there's nobody else here. Just the radio station. - William Baxter? - [J.D.] J.D. Smith. - I met these people. I sat with them. I talked with them. - Hey, bub, I'm sorry. There's no people here. In fact, it's been that way for years. - JKW Planning ring a bell? - Uh, yeah. But that's in the next block over. Not here. Why don't you go home and get some rest? Get some rest. Merry Christmas. (soft rock music) - (scoffs) I suppose you've never seen me before. You're not the same Saint Nick that's been popping up here and there wearing all the oddball hats. - No. It was all me. - I know. - What are you doing on the floor? - I think I'm somewhere in between losing my mind and having a nervous breakdown. - Maybe I can help. - Oh, no. You've already been a big help. And you're part of the reason why I'm headed to the looney bin. - No, I mean, maybe I can help you sort this thing out. Follow me, kid. ("We Wish You A Merry Christmas") - What's with the umbrella? It's not supposed to rain today. - Hmm. You never know. Don't wanna get caught without an umbrella, if you should happen to need one. - Did you read that somewhere? - [Santa] I'm gonna tell you about the time I was in Cuba, they fired a missile at me going over. Really ugly. They never let poor Rudolph join in any reindeer games. - What exactly does that mean? What kinda games do reindeers play anyway? (light, twinkling music) - Hey, Donny. I hope you don't mind, but the boss needs us to get a release form if we're gonna interact with well, you guys. Yeah, you didn't read all the fine print, but it's just a formality. Now Donny, as bright as you were as a student, I think your math has gotten a little rusty. I was in my late 70s when you were nine. That was 35 years ago. Which would make me 110! Got news for you, I didn't make it that long! But it's okay. It's fine. Because now I have an important job, which leads me to you. - Jenny, are you gonna yack all day or give some of us a chance? - Be my guest, Billy. I've got him all primed up. Oh, listen close, Donny. - Now, Donny. This is where it's at. I was a tough guy but I got lost in the desert during a Desert Storm. And the only guy that could find me was the Big Guy. Which leads me back to you. You gotta lay back some. Break the cycle, my friend. Make some time. Slow down. 'Cause there are people in your life you depend on you. - Billy, Billy, Billy. You're worse than Jenny. Move on, pal. - All right, Donny. I'll see you real soon. No, no, I'm just messing with you. I won't see you soon. But I will see you sometime. - Brr. Thought he'd never leave. All right, Don. I am sorry. I have to apologize for, well, being such a.. Well, being nasty earlier. It was just an act! I was playing a part, man! Anyway, you were right. I did try to steal your girlfriend in high school. And as you said, she wasn't much. She's actually doing 30 years in Jersey right now for manslaughter. Ya. Me. Look, what you might think is important in your life, or what you might want, isn't always the best thing for you. All right? Be cool, man. - And in the middleweight division, or the heavyweight division, as now the case may be. In the red corner, Dandy Don Collier! (laughing) Okay, okay. Basics, Donny, basics. I taught you a jab, right-hand, and a hook. Most important basics in boxing. Now, life's a little more complicated. But it still comes back to basics. Love, family, friends. I love you, boy. Keep punchin'. - Hey, dude! Down here! Sheesh. Okay, Einstein. You told me about the kid you used to hock papers with when you were 10. Duh! Did you forget his name was Jimmy? And he looked a lot like me. No respect. All right, you mokes. I don't chew my cabbage twice. You gotta slow down. Just like that 1969 Chevy shoulda slowed down when I was crossing the street in New York after we moved. But, I digress. You got a 10 year old, Donny. Same age as we were when we had the paper route together. I rest my case. Stay groovy, man. - Keep watching, son. - There's no reason you would recognize me. 'Cause you never really saw me. This is the age I am now. Your sister, Donny. I'm your sister, Linda. I told you I love you. You know we never met. And I meant it, honey. Oh, do I mean it. Because we are family. Always were and always will be. Speaking of family... - Hey son. Sorry about all the sneakiness, but I was sorta directing this whole theater piece from the sidelines. I think you get the picture, son. Life is complicated. Don't make it worse. Take more time. Nothing, I mean nothing is more important than family. We'll see each other again at some point, Donny. I am so happy you got to meet Linda. Tell Mom I said, "Hi." I love you. (sobbing) (clock ticking) (tense music increasing tempo) - Excuse me, sir. - Hey, no problem. Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. - [David] Dad! Dad, help! - Hey! Hey! Lock the door! You all right, son? - Yeah, I'm good. - Ho, ho, ho. - Okay. What I tell you about boxing, huh? (soft rock music) - Ladies and gentlemen, we are coming to you live from Downtown High Road where this young man and his father were attacked by a sinister man, and the father... - This just in. A man has been apprehended in the Montgomery County kidnapping case that has baffled the authorities for so long. The three kidnapped youngsters Joey Cox, Tim Miller, and Gabe Dawson have all been found safe and sound. We'll give you more details as we receive them, but it looks like our city's prayers have been answered. Three happy little boys will be spending Christmas with three happy sets of parents. Thank God. You're listening to WPRK, your home for sounds of the season. And now, here are some more Christmas carols for you, kiddos. - Are you sure you're all right, son? - Yeah, I'm fine, Dad. (phone rings) - Okay. - Collier! Where in the world are you? I told you get back here to the office within the hour, we're gonna go over that Davidson account! - Mr. McAlbright, you're fired. (laughs) * Deck the halls with boughs of holly * Fa la la la la, la la la la * 'Tis the season to be jolly (humming) - Hi. - Merry Christmas. Delivery for Kathy Collier. - Oh my goodness. Thank you. Who are they from? - Card's attached, Miss. Right here. - I love you, too. - And this one, my dear, is from us. (airy music with piano) - "May all your Christmas wishes come true. "From your family and friends. "We all love you." I... * Hark the herald angels sing * Glory to the new born King * Peace on earth and mercy mild * God and sinners reconcile * Joyful all ye nations rise * Join the triumph of the skies * - Thank you. * Christ is born in Bethlehem * Hark the herald angels sing * Glory to the newborn King * Hark the herald angels sing * Glory to the newborn King * Peace on earth and mercy mild * God and sinners reconcile * Joyful all ye nations rise * Join the triumph of the skies * With angelic host proclaim * Christ is born in Bethlehem * Hark the herald angels sing * Glory to the newborn King (clapping) (soft rock music) * God rest ye merry gentlemen * Let nothing you dismay * Remember, Christ our Savior * Was born on Christmas day * To save us all from Satan's power * When we have gone astray * Oh, tidings of comfort and joy * Comfort and joy - Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good night. * From God our Heavenly Father * A blessed angel came * And onto certain shepherds * Brought tidings of the same * How that in Bethlehem was born * A son of God by name * Oh, tidings of comfort and joy * Comfort and joy * Oh, tidings of comfort and joy * Oooh * Oooh * Oooh * Oooh * Now to the Lord sing praises * All you within this place * And with true love and brotherhood * Each other now embrace * This holy tide of Christmas * All others doth deface * Oh, tidings of comfort and joy * Comfort and joy * Oh, tidings of comfort and joy * Comfort and joy * Oh, tidings of comfort and joy * Oooh * Oooh
