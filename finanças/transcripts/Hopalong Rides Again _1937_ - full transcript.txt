Achoo! Hey, look out there, Lucky. What are you trying to do, knock me off from here? I'd be doing the community a favor. Ah, ya young squirts. Pretty ain't they? Hey don't do that. Achoo! Hello Lucky! Hello. What lovely flowers. Yeah, I brought 'em for you. Well thank you. Aren't they pretty, Windy? Don't do that. Achoo! Hey, what's the fracas about and who won? They're not fighting. The silly old coot's always upsetting things. Oh that dern bouquet of flowers done it. Hoppy, my hay fever's got me down again. Spring fever he means. Look at that sign. Dern good job I call it. Eh? Looks like something the cat dragged in. Oh what do you mean? That's. Achoo. Eh, you better take something for that. You're gonna drown somebody. I aim to. Are you hurt much? Well what do you think? Where? Well now, well that's kind of a personal question. I reckon he's hurting the most where he hit the hardest. Yeah, right where he fits in the saddle. Ah, you fellas ain't got no delicacy at all. Eh, look out for them big words, Lucky. If you don't they'll snap right back and throw ya. Windy. What's in that jug? Why, it's medicine. Yeah, that's what it is, spring medicine. You see, every spring I get a powerful itch in the feet where some reason or other I just gotta go somewheres. So I, I kinda take a little of this you know to get it outta my system. You know what happens to anybody Uncle Buck catches with liquor on this ranch. Why it ain't liquor. Here, smell it. Here, you taste it. Sulfur and molasses. See? So you told the truth for once. Why I ain't never told a lie in my whole life. Did I Hoppy? Yeah. Well maybe once. Come on Lucky, I'll give you some Arnica to run on your, where you fell. Looks to me like Buck's niece has got a rope on Lucky he ain't gonna be able to get rid of. Hand it over. Oh Hoppy, there's little mite of goats milk in it to make the medicine work. I just wanted to see if Lucky was lying to save your hide. Ah, ya great kid. Yeah. # I still remember # # A night in September # # When I first kissed you sweetheart # # I can't forget # Is that true Hoppy? That what? Spring fever. No. I'm just thinking about what happened over back of them Black Buttes last spring. About this time. Remember? I ain't likely to forget that stampede. 200 head of Bar 20 cattle lost in them blind canyons. Yeah and three of the Bar 20's best riders trampled into something that didn't even look human. Yeah. That stampede wasn't an accident. It was murder, Windy. Plenty back of them Black Buttes I could stand lookin' into. Eh, but you got something else on your mind. Ain't you thinking of that good looking Nora Blake. That lady that homesteaded over in Grass Valley a couple year ago? Eh? Well, maybe a little. And at your age too. Well it's just that I don't like to think of any lady living in a place where there's nothing but rattlesnakes and rustlers and... Say, you got it bad. You better take a swig of this. Come on. Hoppy I have got a tough job for you. Alright, name it. I got an order for 1000 head of stock. Well what's so tough about that? The herd's got to be delivered at Fort Hastings within 10 days. Oh I don't think it can be done, Buck. It's gotta be done. I need the cash. Now you can cut out the fat stock in two days. But that won't give us time to make the ride to Fort Hastings. You'll have to take a shortcut over the Black Butte Trail. Those Buttes are a rustler's nest. Remember that last trip over there? The Black Butte Trail? Yeah, that means trouble. Why can't we take 'em the southern route? We gotta make the contract date. Railroad won't hold the cars. Now Hoppy I don't like it any more'n you do. But I'm up agin' a brick wall. I reckon that's gonna put you up agin' the Buttes. I need that chunk of dinero. Well we'll make it somehow, Buck. Alright boys, come on. We got some wrangling to do. Can I go, Uncle Buck? Can you go where Artie? I've never ridden herd on a trail. Certainly not. Aw, came all the way here from Kansas City for my vacation and you and everybody else treats me like I was a kid. You don't think you're a man yet, do you Archibald? Oh shut up sis, just 'cause you got man you're lucky you think he's the only one around here can do anything. You ride trail? Why if one of those rustlers laid an eye on you he'd skin you alive. Is that so? Just show me one of 'em. I'll give him this. Well sure as shootin' you'll be the death of me yet, Archibald. How can a fella get his place in this world with a name like Archibald? Hey Windy, how do you do that? Do what? All that spinning with your gun? No boy, you don't bother me. Aw come on. Everybody's teasin' me. Now you're the derndest pest I ever seen in all my life. Now keep your eyes open. There. Now go ahead and do it. Oh boy I did it! Hey Lucky. Where's Keno? I ain't seen him. Ah, he's sojourned on the job again. Go see if you can find him and get him out here. Hey you, Keno. Well? So you been hitting the old red eye again? Well what's it to ya handsome? Hoppy wants to see you, pronto. Mr. Cassidy wants to see me so bad why don't he come after me himself? I'm just telling you what he said. I suppose you're going back and tell him what you just saw. I'm no stool pigeon Keno. You're always snooping around trying to find out something so as you can carry it back to that slave driver. Getting yourself set pretty ain't ya, Lucky? Playing up to Buck Peters' niece. Singing her love songs. You'd better pull in your horns. Why don't you make me? I would except Hoppy needs every man he's got. I didn't join up the Bar 20 to fight no wars for 40 pesos a month. And I don't ride herd on the Black Butte Trail. Keno, you came here with a pretty tough rap. You asked Hoppy for a chance and he gave it to ya. Now you show your stuff by laying down on him. You're just plumb yellow, Keno. I shoulda really let ya have it, Keno. I ain't go no fight with you, Cassidy. You got no fight with anybody so long as you can hit like a sidewinder. When you're talking to a guy like this, never turn your back, Lucky. Go on back to your work. You go to Buck Peters and get your time. If I catch you on the Bar 20 Ranch in half an hour I'll come after ya smoking. And Keno, if I was you I'd ride east. Did you hear me? Yeah. You said ride east. Wait a minute. Where ya headin' fella? That's according to who you are. You're the one who's answering. What you want? I wanna see the chief. What for? Him and me's got a deal on. The chief ain't in the Buttes. Who winged ya? Oh had a run in with the foreman of the Bar 20. You had a fracas with Hopalong Cassidy? Yeah. And you're here to tell it? Yeah. Loose talk. Well, being as the chief ain't in these parts I'll get to riding. Not that away. Hit the keyoose into that draw. We aim to be right hospitable like and entertain ya 'til the chief gets back. As long as you got a deal on with him he wouldn't like it if we let you go. Savvy? - Yeah? - Come on. Sorry to hold you up stranger. Oh that's alright. Nice looking cattle you have there. Yeah, the Bar 20 raises nothing but the best. Taking them to market? Breaking trail at dawn tomorrow. One of my horses cast a shoe. Oh that's too bad. Say drive up to the ranch here and ask for Windy. He'll be glad to put it on for ya. Thanks very much. Pretty good, huh? Say, you know I think you got something there Artie. Say Windy, how 'bout you asking Hoppy to ask Uncle Buck if I can go on that trail drive tomorrow? Oh you best stay home. You know we gotta have somebody to take care of the ranch. Aw. Whoa. Where can I find Windy? What's the trouble? My off horse threw the shoe. Can you fix it for me? Of course I'll be glad to pay you for it? Oh shaw. Bar 20 never charges a stranger anything for a little thing like that. Wait 'til I get some nails. Been driving long? Yeah. Where you going? Oh, west. And you don't even carry a gun? No. Say Mister, you're sure not liable to live long. Dear me, why? Well those Buttes are just full of bad hombres. And they just as soon shoot you as look at ya. Oh, you alarm me. We're riding that way tomorrow and you bet your boot that we'll be armed to the teeth. We'll be ready for 'em if they make one false move. Aw heck. A noble effort my little man. Only you seem to be as awkward with firearms as I'm afraid of them. What are you doing? You mind if I ask you the same question, Mister? Oh, this gentleman has an insatiable curiosity regarding my property. I thought I'd teach him a little lesson. I'm Professor Hepburn. I'm visiting my sister, Nora Blake over in Grass Valley. Oh. Nora Blake. Well I'm Cassidy, Hopalong Cassidy. Glad to know ya Professor. She's spoken of you often. Well it must be kinda lonesome over there around the Buttes ain't it? On the contrary. You see I'm paleontologist. A what? A scientist, a naturalist, explorer. In other words I'm a bone digger. Oh yeah. I'm doing some research for an eastern museum. I hope to prove to the scientific world that the Buttes are the natural habitat of the extinct dinosaur and other prehistoric fauna. You don't say? Yes indeed. I'm finding quite a boneyard. A place of desolation where any creature might die and remain undisturbed, undiscovered for a million years. A perfect paradise for my purpose. Well, I guess the Buttes is a kind of a boneyard alright. Say, if you find any bones or hides of the Bar 20 stock, I wish you'd let me know. Alright here Professor. Thanks. I hope you'll forgive any embarrassment I caused. Eh, maybe. But I won't forget it. I aim to ride over to Grass Valley and see how Nora's getting on. You know homesteadin's quite a job for a lady to take on. My sister'll be glad to know what an interest you've taken in her welfare. Well, goodbye. See you both. Thanks. I never saw none of them dinosnorters as he's aiming to hunt. He sure goes after 'em with heavy caliber ammunition. What do you mean? Well did you see what he's got in the wagon? What? Dynamite. Oh well, folks homesteadin' you know they need dynamite. They might wanna blow up some stumps or something. Hoppy I never thought I'd see the day that you let a good looking woman... Eh, eh, just a minute. Well, I hope his horses run away with him and blow him up. Dinosnorters. You know this hombre, Chief? Says he's got some kind of a deal on with ya. What do you want, Keno? The Bar 20's pushing a big herd by here tomorrow. And I'm here to collect that money as you promised me if I tipped you off. You're late with the news. I found out for myself. Listen, I kept my part of the deal and I want my money. You've got nothing coming to ya. After me quitting my job and taking the chance of coming here? That's your misfortune. Then I'll show ya. I'll meet Cassidy and tell him what he's up against? Hold on. Gimme your rifle. Nice shot, Chief. Trifle heavy for sport shooting. Alright boys get the top off. And then carry it all up the hill. Say, what about Keno? Oh, leave him there. Cassidy'll find him. And if he does, what then? Always get your opponent in the jumpy frame of mind. You have the psychological advantage of 'em. You know Blackie, nature has a peculiar way of preserving a biological balance. Yeah. That's right Chief. Ornithology is the most interesting study. Take that buzzard for instance. There's a useful institution. What better coffin could any man desire than one which flies? Blackie, did you ever wish you had wings? Say, I ain't aiming to ride in no clouds nor clang no harp. Don't worry Blackie, ya never will. Clem, fly this wagon over to Grass Valley. Alright. And explain to my sister that I've gone around hunting some fossil specimens. And hurry up back here. Get outta here. Say fellas, you all know what happened on the Black Butte Trail last year. Well if any of you fellas wanna back out, now's the time to do it. What do you think we are, Lucky? - Well take care of it. - We're all out. We're all with Hoppy. Hoppy says be sure that all your guns are in working condition. Just in case we need 'em. Here's an on order on the Cattlemen's Association for the cash. Buck, that's quite a piece of change. Think I'd better put the money in the bank and bring back a check? Am I loco? After that fly by night bank folded up with me last year. I reckon though you better come by the southern route. Alright. So long Buck. Good luck Hoppy. Bye kid. Try and get the herd past the Buttes before dark. Alright. Can't I go Uncle Buck? Haven't I got enough to worry me? Go away. Let's go Lucky. The Buttes have always been bad luck for the Bar 20. Be careful, won't ya Lucky? Alright boys, get started. Come on Lucky. They'll be alright honey. Poor Artie. He wanted to go so badly. Well they can't reach here much before sundown. Start planting it there. Come on boys, hurry up. When it goes off it'll stampede that herd and we'll be able to rustle them. We'll give Mr. Cassidy a welcome to Black Buttes that'll justify a nickname of Hopalong. Hey Lucky! Listen, tell the boys to push 'em a little faster. We'll never make it through there. Artie. Is that any way for a regular cowboy to act? Why I'da let you gone son, but there's too much danger. Danger? That's why I wanna go. You didn't think it danger when you came out here 50 years ago. Why couldn't I been born then. You had all the fun. So, you think it was fun. If you had it all to do over again what would you do? Well I reckon you got me there, Artie. Can I go? Oh it's too late. I got my pony all ready and saddled. And I can catch 'em miles before they reach the Buttes. Now listen here. If you're gonna take a man's place, you're gonna have to do a man's work. I will. Well your gun, your belt and holster are lying right where ya left 'em. Oh boy. Artie! Artie, where are you going? Well I guess he had to learn sometime. I reckon it's in his blood. Whoa, whoa. How 'bout a little water? Yes. They're pushing them steers real hard ain't they? Yeah, but I hope they don't take a notion to turn them into one of them canyons for water. Hoppy, something's happened, come on. Here. Come on. Hup, hip. Giddyup there. I told him to ride east. Plugged right through the back. Probably never known what happened. Maybe he did. One of you boys take care of him. The rest of you better get started. It's gonna be dark soon. And keep your eyes peeled on them Buttes and don't let the herd break that way. Hoppy, look! Here I am. Get off of that horse. Uncle Buck said I could come. Did you hear what I said? Get off of that horse. Now get in the chuck wagon here with Windy. Windy, pull into the foot of that cliff. We'll chow there tonight. Go on, get at it. Come on, unhook 'em there son. Come on. Help me with the dinner. What's that? Get under there. Alright boys, pick up those steers. Windy, Artie! Take it easy Artie, we'll have ya out in just a minute. Get his feet Lucky. See if there's some water in the wagon. Hoppy, what happened to my pony? Your pony's alright, Artie. He's still out there grazing. Hoppy! Hoppy, come here. Hey, look at that. What do you think of your diny snorters feller now, huh? I aim to find out. Come on. There we go. Where's the herd? The boys are holdin' 'em about six miles south of the Buttes. That is what's left of 'em. How many missing? About 200 head, near as we could tally. How about the men? Oh a few sprained wish bones. We didn't have no chance to make our fight. Ride back and get the herd moving south. But Hoppy aren't you gonna fight to get our stolen cattle back? No. Say it ain't like you Hoppy. Just like what happened last year Hoppy. Only it'll never happen again. Oh Lucky. You know Artie can't be moved. Will you make a camp and look out for him here? Yeah? Lucky, from now on you're in charge of the herd. I want you to roll 'em into Fort Hastings. Here's the cash order. You'll be paid for the number of steers you deliver. I want you to listen close. I want you to get the cash and ride back this way at exactly 12 noon, eight days from now. No sooner and no later. Now you got that? That's a week from tomorrow. That's right. You won't let me down, will ya kid? Have I ever? No. So long. Bye Hoppy. Good luck son. If it's any of my business, what are you aiming to do? Windy, when you go after big fish, you got to use live bait. I'm going fishing. And Lucky is my bait. That's just as plain as a Chinese laundry ticket. If I can just get them rustlers down outta the Buttes, out here into the open that's all I want. And I think I've figured out a way to do it. You better throw up a few rocks there for protection. I got ya. And if you're right about Nora Blake, a woman that plays a man's game has to take a man's chances. So long. So long Hoppy. Whoa there Artie boy. You're supposed to be sick. I'm hungry. Hungry? Dog goned if I ain't afraid you're gonna get well. Howdy Nora. Well if it isn't Hopalong Cassidy. Say, who's your boyfriend there in window? Boyfriend. Horace has the funniest sense of humor. You see that's my brother's laboratory now. Oh. Come on inside. Thanks. I must've known you were coming. - Yeah? - Look. Oh, donuts. My favorite dish. And good too. So you know, that thing out there kinda scared me. Well when you meet Horace you'll understand. Oh I have met him. Oh he didn't tell me. But then he's so absent minded sometimes. But I'd like to know him better. Well come on then. Just a minute. Alright. Horace. - Horace! - What? Huh? Oh hello. Mr Cassidy is interested in your work Horace. I've just made the most astounding anthropological discovery, Mr. Cassidy. You see, there's a missing link in the human group between the paleolithic and neolithic ages. The intermediary between the flat skull and the round type. You don't tell me. We have here, the cornered cranial structure. So long sought by science. Oh you mean kind of a square head, huh? Hey, I think I know this fella. Well now careful, you're liable to destroy a priceless specimen. Yes sir, that's him alright. Fella named Anthony. He was a rustler. The boys from the Bar 20 captured him red handed up on Thunder Mesa. See, that's where they parted his hair with a .45. No, you must be mistaken. Oh no, I'm not. Just a minute here. There's the slug. Say, when you get ready to put this fella in a museum, just label him as a sample of what happens to people that can't keep their running irons off of Bar 20 stock. I should have made such a mistake. Oh we all make mistakes. But some of us don't make 'em twice. I can't understand it. Say, did you come here to visit me or Horace? Where's your shadow? - Huh? - Windy. He's always at your heels. Oh Windy. Oh he's got hay fever. I left him over at the Bar 20. Now Artie, how ya feeling? Pretty good. That's fine. Now you just take it easy and I'll go get a little fresh water. No thanks. Oh have another. Oh alright. You haven't your usual appetite. No. And how's Lucky? Oh I was gonna tell you about Lucky. We were all. What's that? My brand. I just had it registered with the Cattleman's Association. The triangle is the shape of my little valley. The double B is for the Black Buttes that surround it. But you were gonna tell me about Lucky. Why, what's the matter Hoppy? Nora, I sent Lucky to Fort Hastings with a big buncha stock. I'm gonna meet him at the Buttes when he arrives back with the money. That will be several thousand dollars. Yeah. But do you think it's safe to allow Lucky... I trust Lucky. Well then I'm to have your company until Lucky returns? Well, unless you throw me out. Mr. Cassidy, consider yourself my prisoner. And I couldn't ask for a prettier jailer. And about ready. Let him up boys. Drake, I want you to ride fast for Fort Hastings. Check on a man named Lucky. Find if he's riding back this way with money and when. Burn at the back and report. We done a good job of blunting, Chief. In two weeks you'd never know if it Bar 20 or Nora's new triangle double B. Yeah. Hepburn's got them steers bottled up in Satan's Canyon. They're blunting the Bar 20 brand to triangle BB. Sent a feller to Fort Hastings to check on Lucky. That's just what I figured. Now we can get that gang down out of the Buttes into the open here and have an open fight. Now when Artie's well enough to be left alone, you hot foot it back to the Bar 20. Have Buck and the boys back here when Lucky makes his ride by. Now beat it. Keep under cover and don't let anybody see ya. Get up! You lied to me, Hopalong. Why did you tell me Windy was back at Bar 20? Because rustlers are raiding the Bar 20 stock. And they're using your brand to cover their tracks. Then I'm under suspicion? I'm in the Buttes to find the guilty party. I'm afraid you'll have to prove what you say, Mr. Cassidy. I aim to. And Windy is part of my plan. Artie! Thanks Windy. Yeah. I can't leave ya now, son, but it's sure knocks Hoppy's plan higher than a kite. You know you've been here a week today and you haven't proven anything to me yet. There's one now. There's the old Bar 20 brand. You see how they've changed it over to the triangle double B? I'm sorry I doubted you Hoppy. It's alright, Nora. My men must've known about this. I'll fire every last one of them. Oh no, don't do that. Lucky and Windy carried out my orders, I'm gonna make my play today. I've been a lotta bother to you, haven't I? Bother, shaw. It's alright. Just as long as you're still in the ring. Who was it? Looks like trouble. And the odds are agin' us. Now listen sonny, you and me'd better make just the best fight we can. Of course. I kept you from going after Uncle Buck, didn't I? Why you couldn't help it. Just the same I wish Hoppy was here. Lucky'll be riding along here any minute. Get me a drink, will ya? Sure. Artie! Artie come back here. I'm going for Uncle Buck and the boys! Young whippersnapper. Hello Horace. Hello. Where are you going? I'm shipping some specimens east to the museum. Taking them to the railroad at Fort Hastings. There's an interesting one. Well, better be going. Well take care of yourself Horace. Well if I'm not back in a few days, don't you worry about me. Bye. Bye bye. You certainly had me worried. I mean about Horace. I was afraid you suspected him. Him? Your brother's a big man. He has more important things to think about in the world than rustling cattle. Here comes Dirk. Bar 20 fella's coming with the money. Catch him when he rides by the Buttes. Blackie, your rifle. Gimme your rifle. Oh Hoppy. Hoppy. Do that again. Mr. Cassidy. Nora, look up toward the pass. See anything? No. Whoever took that pot shot at me wasn't fooling. They didn't miss far. Now's the time for me to make my play. Goodbye Nora. Did you mean it just now when you kissed me? Come back some time out. I aim to. Goodbye Hoppy. Goodbye Nora. Whoa. Clem, you stay here. The rest of you come with me. Giddyap. Come on. Come on! Shorty, where's Hoppy? Well Hoppy stopped over at the Buttes. What for? We don't know. Where's the money? Lucky's got it. Where's Lucky? Where's Artie? Sorry Buck, we got in a little trouble over at the Buttes. And Artie got mussed up a little. Uncle Buck, look! Uncle Buck, trouble at the Buttes. Gotta ride fast. Hoppy needs us. Get my horse. Saddle up boys. Boys, if Hoppy's got that Black Butte gang in the open, we've a long score to settle. We'll never call you Archibald again, Artie. Alright boys, let's go. Come on. Let's get him. Go boys. Hold it. Cassidy's too much of a man to shoot in the back. Come on. Now we are in a fine spot. You got the money? Good. Why didn't you get here on time? Now you made me bust my heirloom. Your what? My grandpa's watch. You better save your breath. You might need it later. Why didn't you shoot Cassidy when you had a chance? I couldn't plug him in the back. Alright, get down there and charge that wall. Here they come. Well Buck, looks like your trouble with the Black Buttes is finished. I reckon so. Poor devil. I hope Nora never finds out. Dog gone it Hoppy you're in love. Maybe you're right. Me too. Yeah, this must be springtime. You know fellers are liable to get that way when the posies begin to bloom. Achoo.
