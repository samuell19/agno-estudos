Have I got something in my eye? Seems a bit red. I saved you some jello. He returns her slap with his right hand. He approaches her, she raises her arms and pushes him. He steps back. He moves toward her. As he's getting ready to grab her... she raises her arms and takes hold of him. Their bodies begin to move irregularly in space. She finds the opportunity to lift her right leg... and kicks him in the stomach. The guy doubles over. She turns and starts running... escaping in the opposite direction. He gets up and starts to pursue her. He catches up with her. He grabs her right arm... twists it behind her back... forces her palm against her left shoulder blade... and with his left hand, he grips her throat. He starts dragging her backwards. With her left hand, she tries to hit him in the head. She is unsuccessful... so she decides to jab him with her elbow. The guy doubles over once again. She seizes the opportunity to escape. She is in flight. The guy stands up again, runs after her... immobilizes her, grabs her hair... and throws her on the ground. After she falls down, he bends over her... and tries to thrust her back against the dirt. She manages to punch him with her right fist. She punches him again, now with her left fist. As the guy retreats... she gets the chance... to kick him with her right foot. The guy falls back. She turns on her hands and knees... and attempts to break away. The guy rises and, with a swift movement... in a sure plunge... he grabs her leg... pulls her towards him... rolls her over... and with slow movements, crawling... he slides on top of her. - Should I make the room? - Yes. - Is it gonna take long? - No, I'll make it fast. - How fast? - 10 or 15 minutes... Good. Go and wait for me in the car. Which one? The grey one. Slippers? Spinach pie? Piroski is the word for spinach pie? Yes. Car? Ice cube? Road? Bread? Home? Beach? I don't know. Magazine? Can I offer you another jello? Got another one in the freezer? No, but I could stick one in. Nah... Don't bother. Hurry up! We won't make it. Hurry up! We won't make it. When can I have the videotape? - As soon as I make the dub. - When is that? - When I get a chance. - Wednesday? - Which Wednesday? - This Wednesday. How about next Wednesday? Alright. How long was she crawling on the grass? Does it matter? She looks a bit stiff. You're cozy when you're crawling? Her neck position shows that she was stiff. It's probably her collar that confuses you. Her mouth is open. Just enough so she could breathe. Did she sweat? A little. Did she ask for a drink of water? I don't remember. That hole behind her... what is it? The pool. That's what the pool looks like? I thought you wanted the photo to check her clothing... The shoes are on the wooden thing with the slots. As she is running... the heels of her shoes... the high heels of her shoes... sink into the sand. She loses her balance, and falls down. The guy swiftly moves behind her. Pulls her back vigorously, dragging her to the car. She resists, but he... with increasing force... he keeps pulling her. He yanks her to the car. He rolls her over, abruptly... and thrusts her against the hood. She finds an opportunity to escape. She flees toward the beach. She runs. The guy spots her and starts running after her. He catches up with her. With his left hand, he grips her hair... and throws her down with great power. After she's on the ground, she stares at him... she lifts her legs to repel him... to keep him away... by kicking her legs in the air... and swinging her body... in all directions. He tries to find a way in. He circles around her... he keeps circling and circling. Suddenly, he finds a way in... and mounts her. He blocks her. His hands grab her throat and squeeze it. He chokes her, until she loses consciousness. Come in. It itches. It's bleeding. Do you want something to drink? What have you got? - Only water. - Water. - What? - Water. - Tap water. - Yes. Thank you. Do you want to listen to some music? Yes. Where is your shoe? Outside. How much? It's the same car. How much? The price can only go up, not down. How much? - BMW. - How much? The owner...he passed away. He drove it for six months.... It's brand new. How much? - 30,000 euros. - 30,000... Five years' guarantee... brand new... power. - Can't afford it. - Think about it. It'll change your life. Ok? Ok. You grab your little shirt, you lift it to your face... till it reaches your eyes. Until it reaches your eyes. You stop there. As you lift your shirt... you raise your head... revealing your eyes that look straight at me. You now remove your shirt entirely... and drop it on top of the jacket. You turn toward the painting. You admire the poppies. You stare at the sky in the painting. You suddenly raise your head and stare at the ceiling. With your index finger and thumb... you hold the waist of your blue jeans... and slowly lower them. With your thumb and index finger... you hold the blue jeans... and slowly you lower them. You lower them. Lower them. You lower them. Hold it right there. You tilt your back slightly forward. Your back leans like this...for a bit. Once again, two, three times... left, right, your head, your hair. Now, as you are, you turn... you look at me... you drop your hands... and reach around to the clasp. You undo the clasp. Yes, like that. With both hands, you undo the clasp. And with your right hand... you lower the left strap of your bra. And with your left hand, you lower the right strap. You turn once again and look at the painting. You sway your body... sometimes to the left, sometimes to the right. You drop your bra onto the sofa. You drop your hands. Simultaneously, the bra falls on the sofa. You make a leisurely turn... and look at me. You raise your hands, slowly... and fix your hair. Your right foot on the gas... your left foot on the brake. Right...gas. Left... brake. Are you hungry? A little. Do you want me to make you a sandwich? If you've got anything... Should I put mayonnaise on it? Just a bit. The bathroom? Door on the left.
