AUGUST 32ND ON EARTH August 32nd Lucky you to get away in one piece. 5:30. What day is it? It's 5:35, August 32nd, it's Friday. Look... Fuck, I have a plane to catch. Look, forget your plane, your car's dead and with a concussion you must go to the hospital. It's nearby anyway, I know where to go. Don 't worry, it's going to be alright. Hold on a second. I have tissues. Here... OK, it's fine, just relax. Look, I must speak to you because you must remain conscious, you have to stay awake because you may have a concussion, it's important you stay awake awake awake, OK, then have some more, have some more. It's the opposite... The opposite? I'm the one who must speak, not you. Well, then speak to me. Monica? This is Simone, sorry to wake you up. No, I haven't left, I had an accident. A big one... No, I'm alright, I think so. Well, in a clinic somewhere, I don't know. Yes, I know. Today, now? Yes I know, don't panic, I'll take a plane tomorrow night. Yes, I know. They'll wait for me, that's it, okay'? I'll be at the office tomorrow morning, bye. Getting better? Yes, they'll sort things out so I can leave tomorrow evening. Good. I called the police for you, they'll take care of everything. Thank you. Maybe you'll feel tired for a few days it's the nervous shock after such an accident. That's normal. Some rest, that's all. Perhaps you'll have some minor memory problems. Short term. Memory? I'll give you an example. My flame is... 7?? I was born in Bombay in 1951. What is my name? Good morning Madam, this is Simone Prévost, is my mother there? Yes. Oh. Tell her I'll call later. Right, I'll call her later. Alright thank you. August 33rd Oh, fuck. Philippe... Oh, Juliette, that's you? Is Philippe there? No. OK I see. No no, I'm in Italy, look, listen... You jealous! Italia mi amore. It's amazing as usual. I just wanted to ask Philippe if eh, listen, I'll call back later. Does he have his pager? Ah, OK. OK fine, ciao. Philippe? This is Simone, listen, don 't tell it to anyone, but I haven't left for Italy I must see you. Let's meet at my place in an hour, you have to be there, it's serious. That's it. Is it alright to have coffee with the vaccine? Yes. How is Juliette? Listen to this: 200 dead in Algeria, all charred, Shit. You're in form in the morning. Stéphane, I've made a big decision, I think I'll quit medicine. Pardon? That's me that's me that's me. Who is it? - Isn't Simone in Italy? - Yes, THE woman is in Italy. Excuse me, I must go, emergency. Yes, okay. Good bye. Mr. Quedima, yes? Thursday, eh? Yes, no problem. Hair removal? Okay, thank you, see you on Thursday Mr. Quedima, goodbye. Hello, I'd like to talk to Monica Perez, she's here, I think she is in the sunbed. As everyone here madam, and if so she can't be disturbed. I'll ask Nicole, wait a moment. Thank you. - Monica, it's Simone. - Oh, God, Simone. Oh, fool, you scared me. Excuse me. I'm here to tell you that I resign. Let's see, wait 2 minutes. I resign, this time it's true. Simone? Simone? When are you leaving? I'm not. It's being canceled? No, but eh, this morning I decided it was over. Over, OK it's over until Tuesday, let's say Friday. Over for all life long until Friday, isn't it? No no no no. No bluffing that time, Philippe I stop it all, I hate it all. No more photos, videos, movies, that's it. I know someone that'll get really depressed. You're nasty in the morning, Philippe Despins. You're silly, Simone Prévost. Then what will you do? - Nothing. - Nothing? It's not easy to do nothing, have you ever tried it? What are you doing this morning? - You? - Nothing. Do you want to do nothing with me? What nothing are you going to do exactly? Oh, look at the cat. It's cool to be a cat. I mean, you go in the sun all day, beautiful girls run after you. It must be some kind of hormone they have, surely something to do with it. I have a favour to ask you, Philippe. Sure. Do you remember we promised each other something. We promised a lot of things. That, when we are 30, if none of us had found anyone to have a child, then we would have one together, do you remember that? It reminds me of something... Could you make me a child, Philippe, please? Philippe? Look, the deal is when we are 30, that's 4 more years for you, and I have found someone, I mean, Juliette... Yes, I understand. Listen Simone why do you suddenly mention that? Because. Simone Simone Simone. Listen Philippe, I'm asking you that because I like you, because you're my best friend. But, a promise is not binding. If you don 't want it, I can't force you. Okay, you've found someone else. I can 't make love with you. I'm not talking about making love I'm talking about making a child, it's not the same. Look, we can make love in the dark, eyes closed, you imagine I'm Juliette and everyone's happy. - You said again to make love. - No, I mean technically, oaf. Anyway you fucked with half of your friends. Big deal. Exactly, it's complicated. Listen Simone, I can't explain love to myself, so explaining it to someone else... I can't have a child now. No, Philippe, I didn't say that you'll have a child, I said that I'll have a child. I want to bring him up alone, I'll live with Claudine in the West, it's beautiful, you can come and see the baby, when you want, if you want, if it tempts you. Easy. Philippe, it's super sensible, you know me, I can't stay with a bloke more than 3 months. Why should I mess around with some jerk for the rest of my life? At least with you I'm sure of my choice. Big deal. I'm not crying for the moon. What about your job? Your perfume vendors won't love the idea of your belly turning into a whale's. You'll swell all over, you're gonna be fat. Listen Simone, I can 't make love with you, you're not a girl for me. You're like a man, I mean you're like my pal, you're not a girl. I'll show you quickly enough that I'm a girl, you'll see. It's really hard to be your best friend, Simone Prévost. - I knew you 'd say yes. - Did I? Yeah you said yes. And when do you want to do that? Now now. Now now? Nonsense. Philippe, if I don't make a child, loan die anytime. We are not eternal forever. Do you want a tea? A tea? Well, yes. Nope. Oh yes. OK. Philippe, do you want to brush your teeth or have a shower? Brush teeth? Yes. After me. Yes. I kept it in the freezer for hard blows. This is a hard blow. Here. Phone. I'm not here. I'm in Italy. No one knows I'm here. Well. In one go! To our offspring! Well OK timeout stop, I haven't said yes. I'll say yes but... - only on one condition. - Shoot. OK. The condition is the following, if we are going to do it, let's do it smartly, I'll make love to you but in a desert. That's it, in a desert. - In a desert? - In a desert. Philippe, that's why I like you. Desert. Oh boy, it's far away far away... That's how it is. That's how it is, yeah. Well, let's forget about Africa. California, Nevada, Utah. The desert thing, it's a joke. Salt Lake City is the closest. Salt Lake City must be beautiful. Salt Lake City tomorrow 6am. You can access that? You, pilot's daughters, you're really spoiled by life. Us, pilot's daughters, we don 't have a father. By the way, to make a baby, I thought, you need a father, I mean, you need an ovum, right? Usually, yes. But how do you know you would be ready to... I was just saying on a guess, I mean it would be, you take the pill? No, I haven 't for at least 4 years. And I'm like a Swiss clock, my ovulation should be roughly in 48 hours, definitely. And you, spermatozoonly speaking, are you alright? It's alright, yes, it's alright, yes. OK. There are some seats available tonight, return tickets - 24 hours. 24 hours are enough? Are you free for the next 24 hours? No, but it won't do, no it's not serious, Simone. I didn't know you had a tattoo. If you had ever fucked with me you 'd have seen it. Philippe, do you have your passport? Yes, at home. Is it all right? Yes, I think. Okay, perfect. Go What am I doing? What should I be doing? Did you put it here? It's not in this room. Here. Phil'? Juliette? Where are you? In your tub. What are you doing here, oh unpredictable and unexpected woman? - I have no water at home. - Really? - Why are you here, something wrong? - Your appointment with Stéphane? Stéphane? I've got another 24 hours. Pardon? Philippe Despins, you're completely exhausted. No, no, I'm not that tired. It's you who'll get ill. You can 't stack 24 hours repeatedly like that. Juliette I don't have a choice, damn! "Juliette I don't have a choice, damn!" Simone called you from Italy. Simone? - Simone Prévost? - Your Simone. Phil'? Philippe? Yes yes, I can't hear you anymore. I can't hear you anymore. What is it? It's me, shh not too loud. I need an advice from you. A sincere advice bang! Direct. - Morning? - It's noon. Look, it's really important for me. Shoot There's a guy, a girl asks a guy to make her a baby, but the girl will live all alone with the child. The guy is rather in love with the girl. My question is should he accept the deal and fuck her? Is Simone not supposed to be in Italy? Answer, please. Listen, Philippe, if it's the story of a guy who's in love with a girl, the woman of his life, but she wants to know nothing about him, and the guy has been depressed for 3 years because of her and his best friend has put up with it for 3 years, then the best friend doesn't want to hear about the girl anymore, so, it's no way. Thank you. You really are the best pal. Go back to sleep, OK. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I've got to split, love. My name is Philippe Despins My name is Philippe Despins... August 34th Are you ready? A little. - Give me your license. - My license? Driving? No, your license to breathe. Simone, you know I don't have a driver's license. You don't have one? No, I don't have a driver's license. You've got one? You're 30 and you don't have your license? Not bad! I'm 30, I don't have a license, you know I don't like cars. I hate cars. Waow! Not bad, not bad, not bad, not bad... Oh boy, it's white. Look, I'm sorry Simone, I wouldn't be able, even if we go further. Me neither. It's stupid. I would have thought there would dunes or something, but I... - Surely the UFO is watching us. - Yes. Sure sure sure. Well. We must come back alone. Jesus. It's Sunday. It's Sunday? Simone, I don't fancy the idea of staying here all alone... Shoot Philippe, do you have a better idea? - My god! - Naughty swindler. The most beautiful moment of my life, Simone. You're nice. Hot, isn't it? What time is it now? 10:40 I think we'll do that somewhere elsewhere. Try to find something a little more improvised. Let's say that it lacks a little spontaneity maybe. Finally It's not such a horny place. I'm happy- Good. Yes, it is. It's even very good. A UFO. It's here, right? It seems to me, yes. He should be here. Oh boy. Bloody hell. He ' ll hear from me. A real dickhead. Hey man, we're three hours away from the airport. Philippe at the back, quick. That's dangerous. You're lucky, it doesn't look broken. We'll walk a little, it'll do you good. Feeling better? My nose is disgusting, isn't it? It gives you a little vulnerable look. A little disgusting look, right? A girl who nosebleeds is beautiful. You need a doctor to say so. I'm not a doctor yet. In a year, Philippe. Are you not happy? You know, Simone, I think, finally, I don't feel like ending my life in a hospital. No, but what I mean is... Philippe, Philippe, Philippe. You did 2 years of biology, a year of biochemistry, 2 years of music, 4 months or 6 months of law, I don't know anymore. You tried anthropology. I didn't try it, I never studied anthropology. - Yes you tried anthropology. - What are you talking about? - I never studied anthropology. - You don 't even remember it. Simone, the more I know things, the more I have doubts. I understand the world around less and less. Is crumbling. Well, I think we can forget about the plane. It doesn't matter Philippe, I'll find other tickets, you 'll see. Well, don 't make that face! I'm in a rather stupid position. I must go back to Montreal tonight, have you noticed, it'll be complicated to explain Juliette that I went to the sticks of the United States to fuck Simone Prévost, the girl she hates most in the world. Maybe I need to look convincing. - Juliette doesn't like me? - You mustn't like her that much to suggest me things like that? I have nothing against Juliette. What does your Juliette blame me for? I don 't know why we are talking about that. I said nothing, OK? - Philippe? - Nothing. Nothing? Let's say she thinks you have a seduction problem, that's all. A problem? - What, I'm a teaser? - No, no, no. - It just means that... - She thinks I'm a teaser. Simone... Let's say, it's just that you emit... a stronger charm than you think... You don 't pay attention to the way you look at guys, that's it, OK? That's it. And you agree with that? Simone, I don 't think you're a teaser, OK? I just want to say... Go on! - Go on what? - Go on. I have nothing left to say, OK? I have nothing left to say. For how long have you been with Juliette? 4 months. For how long have I known you? 5, 6 years. Simone. - Simone, where are you going? - I'm going to pee. Simone Listen, I'm sorry, I I get hyperglycemia attacks when I'm hungry, I say all kinds of crap, don't pay attention. Don 't go that far, there's nobody around. You haven 't even fucked me, she can 't say anything, your fucking girl friend. Wait. Stay here, Philippe. Well, I think we must reach the highway before dark. On the highway people will stop. I hope so. We can't leave him alone, Philippe. We'll leave a landmark, otherwise they'll never find him. They keep on not seeing us, as if we were ghosts. We are completely translucent. And in translucent (translucide in French), there is lucid. How do you translate charred corpse in English? Simone, I'll be honest, direct, like a best friend. Woman of my life, I love you, not as you love me, but as I love you. Not as you love me, but as I love you. Making love with you would have been the most beautiful moment of my life, to see the woman of one's life coming, seems to be apotheosis in the life of a man. But, you don't love me as I love you, so to make love to you... and I'm done. That's not well said, but... but steadily done, that's why I sabotage, I scuttle, it's pure self-protection, everything crumbles, this is the end of an era, I love you. Philippe. PS. In return I'll ask you a favor. I would like to never see you again. To overcome the cruelty of fate, I offer you the following deal: I'll take Central America, North coast, Eastern New Zealand, India, New York and Byblos. I leave you the rest of the planet. It seems reasonable to me. Okay well that's it. I have standby tickets. No doubt about it, we'll leave tomorrow, 80%, always available seats at the last minute on those flights. 80%. No doubt about it, we'll leave tomorrow, Philippe, I'm sorry. We'll have some sleep. Are you hungry? They just have chicken and fast food I'm not hungry anymore either. Okay let's have some sleep. I think I'll never be able to sleep again. Never. - Did I sleep? - No, no no. - I haven't slept? - No no no. That's weird, damn! Ridiculous. 150 rooms fora tourist trap. Shoes have to be removed. It's Japanese to the tip of the toes. It feels like in a fiberglass suppository. Are you claustrophobic? There is a strange smell. - Your feet stink, Philippe. - No. No. Oh luxury, a TV. This is the TV. TV, radio, Kleenex, phone, fridge, oh oh oh mini-bar. Too bad that we are alcoholic, eh? Can you sleep, Philippe? Not really, no. So. What are you doing? Hi, this is Juliette, I'm here but I'm not here. For you, gift, mezcal, your favorite drug. We'll end the trip in style, man. Well thank you, thank you very much not bad thank you a lot. Nice worm. Very warm. Fuck, Philippe, Fuck. - I've just swallowed the worm. - Oh no. - Yes - You must vomit. Strong it's super strong. But it's too late, what do I do? I don't know. The only one who tried is Mathieu Caouette and then he behaved like a plastic pink flamingo for 3 days. It's not funny. It's not funny at all, I want to completely lose control. You must vomit, you must vomit. You vomit. When I'm pregnant, I will vomit daily. It's gonna be cool. All the guys will say I'm beautiful, even if they look elsewhere. I'm going to have super big tits, like that. It's gonna be fantastic. Yeah sir. This is for you. - What is it? - It's a letter. It's a letter in which I explain why I don 't want and I won 't have a child with you. You'll read it when you're in Montreal. Philippe, Philippe. OK. OK what? OK what? I'm a hero. August 35th Madame. Madame. Madame. We've arrived. - Where are we. - At your place. Wasn't I with someone before? He left earlier, he told me to drop you here. - What do I owe you? - It's already paid. Hi,this is... Hi, this is Juliette, I'm here but I'm not here. Juliette OK, I know you're there, I'm coming. Philippe, call me back, it's extremely important. Come. Hi guys, do you need help? Yes, how about fighting? Pardon? I'm Stéphane, this is Marky Boy, this is Dan - Hi. - Hi. We think you wanna fight. - Oh, not especially. - Do you want? Do you want it? August 36th He is like floating somewhere. It's deep coma. Loan 't tell you if he'll come back one day. Neither when, nor in what state. I can't find a good reason for going down here, Philippe. You shouldn't try to find one, Simone. Stay with me, Philippe. September 5th September 9th - Hello. - Hello. I'm his girlfriend. - You can enter. - Thank you. Philippe, I wanted to tell you your letter is beautiful. Bastard. You know I've wanted to go to India fora long time. We must talk about our territories. Let's talk about it another time. I want you to keep your eyes closed, OK? Do you promise? I want to make love to you, OK my love? OK?
