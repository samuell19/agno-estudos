[phone vibrates] [phone vibrates] Who's calling this late? So annoying. Hello? Hello? Who is this? [phone vibrates] Hello? 'What are you doing with my daughter?' Who was it? It was your dad. Shut up! I'm serious. My dad's dead. Then Who was [choking] -Hey, you okay? What happened? -[brakes squeal] Uhh- Dark eyes Maybe a hat. Like this? No, it was more of a hood and the mask was red. Are you sure it was a mask? Of course I'm sure. Well- I mean, you said it was dark. No human face looks like what I saw. I never said human. What do you mean? Fiona Tell me about your father. I never knew him. He died when I was a baby. Well, if he died then how did he call you? I don't know, maybe it was somebody pretending to be him? Do you know what your father looks like? Yeah, my mom's got lots of pictures. He, um... He was tall. He had dark hair. How did he die? Car accident. Did they ever recover the body? I don't know. Never recovered body. No, I said that I didn't know, why? Why? Maybe nothing. Maybe everything. Are you going to tell me what's going on here? Fiona I've been researching abductions. Human abductions. Reports of people being abducted and then returned. I don't understand. Abducted means kidnapped. They're cinnamons. No, I I mean kidnapped by who? There are implants. Little sophisticated devices that can be placed inside of the cerebellum to control what person says and does. Make them do things. Things that he or she doesn't necessarily want to do. Like, kill a person. Their technology is so advanced. What, the... The government? No. You don't believe in that conspiracy BS, do you? Then who? Aliens. I mean, you said it yourself, right? If the door was locked, how did he get in? Maybe it wasn't him? Well He was phone, wasn't he? I don't know. Fiona, your father was obviously taken. as many people are Now his mind is not his own. Now I ask Is such a thing even possible? Yes, it is. Couldn't it just have been somebody pretending to be him? No. I'm finished. This is over! Don't say anything else! Mom, we were just talking. Shut it, Fiona! Okay. I have the best attorney on speed dial. You two will be picking up trash tomorrow. Ma'am, your daughter is not a suspect. Don't ma'am me! You don't scare me! I know my rights. Mom, stop! Why don't we leave you two alone? You can decide if you want an attorney present. -We don't need an attorney. -Oh, we most certainly will. Cool. Alright. Fiona, if you think of anything else. My attorney will be in touch with you. Barbara, let's go. My name is Annie! Fantastic! Are you okay? Is he dead? I just want to make sure you're not hurt. Is Dad dead? That wasn't your father on the phone, honey. That was just someone playing a mean joke. You're not answering my question. And what were you doing out last night, anyway? It is a school night. It's summer. And I don't like you spending the night with your boyfriend. Premarital sex is wrong. He's not my boyfriend. Premarital sex is wrong! I was born three months after your wedding! You were premature. So you're not going to answer my question? You already know the answer. No, I don't! I don't know anything. That's right. If it wasn't Dad on the phone, then who was it? I don't know. One of your cool new friends? That's right. I don't like this new group you've been running around with. What ever happened to your nice friends? Like Aiden or Brayden or Phladen? [papers shuffling] Hashtag nightmares. He's been writing her letters this entire time. Your dad's a psycho. Was a psycho. Is a psycho. Come on, Stacy. It's true. Hey, can I see that? Hey! You're on! "Coming up next" "the brutal murder of a local college student." "Are children safe in campus--" "The fuck are you doing?" Turn it off. What? No, I want to see this. Turn it off! Stacy, come on We've all had enough. Fine. Clarence was a good friend. The best. We have to get this guy. What did the police say so far? I don't know. They don't know anything. Hashtag as usual Man, I want to shoot the police An email So they're up to date with the information that we have. Man, fuck the police. You know, they're the only ones standing in a way of total anarchy. I can't believe you would say that. What does that mean? Well, what does it mean, Stacy? Um Fiona? We've known each other for a really long time now. Whatever you need, anything at all I'm going to always be there, okay? Aww, thanks Phil. You're such a good friend. What's up, losers? Hey Stacy. Hey Fiona. Hey Shut the hell up, idiot. [camera shutter clicks] Hashtag can you be any more annoying? Uh, yes. I think it's cute that you hang out with your little brother. Hey, let's get this straight, I babysit him. Shut up Steve! Man, get over there! [fart] Did you just shit yourself? No! How do you know? That's right, you don't. I fart so you smell better. -What? -[laughs] What did you say? Good one! Jessica, you've seen pretty much every horror movie out there. I guess. Then you should know what's going on better than any of us. Yeah, what is it, nerd girl? Don't keep us in the dark. Maybe your pops is a vampire, Fiona. Vampires sparkle in daylight. Did you see him in daylight? No. There was a phone call in The Ring. Have you seen the Japanese version? It's a lot different from the American-- Gross! I don't watch remakes. Hashtag they ruin everything. Moron! It wasn't a remake! So Steve-O, when did you want to do that photo shoot? I don't know if you're hot enough, Stacy. Whatever. Check this out. Ooh! Sweet rack! Hashtag nice turd. Aww, thanks! Alright, this weekend. All three of you. Photo shoot. My hot tub. Sounds good to me. Hashtag keep dreaming. I guess you never really know your parents. You just have to believe what they tell you. What if we try to find your father? How? [typing] What is that? Is- Is that a dead body? [gasps] Impossibru! -[phone vibrates] -[screams] Hello? 'We found him.' And we're bringing him in now. You assured me that I could speak. 'I'm under arrest?' Hello? Gentlemen, this is democracy manifest. Have a look at the headlock here. See the chap here? Get your hand off my penis! This is the bloke got me on the penis, people! What are you doing this to me for? What's the reason? What's the charge? Eating a meal? 'A succulent Chinese meal?' Oh, ah yes! That's a good headlock, sir. 'Good one.' And you, sir Are you waiting to receive my limp penis? How dare...? Take your hands off of me! Ta ta! Farewell! [car door slams] I was home at 7PM every night. And I didn't leave the house after that. None of this happened. Detective, why am I under arrest? What, I'm a prime suspect because somebody pretended to be me on the telephone? You aren't the prime suspect, Mr. Stephens. Well, then who is? Mr. Stephens Let me ask you a question. Have you ever seen a UFO? No! Are you sure? Of course. Hey, what is this? Whether you have or whether you haven't it's irrelevant, Mr. Stephens. Doesn't mean that they aren't out there. I'm not so sure what you're getting at. Listen I'm not going to say it was aliens But it was aliens. Aliens. What about vampires and werewolves too? Don't be ridiculous, Mr. Stephens Those aren't real. And aliens are? Yes. Mr. Stephens Why do your wife and daughter think you're dead? Look, I'm going to be honest with you-- Let me stop you there. Do you know what every bullshit story starts with? Be me. Middle aged stud meets some crazy broad with epic jugs. All my friends say she was a slut. But they were right. Well, I get a call a month later. Crazy slut knocked up. Feels bad, man. Why didn't you use a condom? I hate condoms. I think it feels better with a condom. Anyway Mr. Stephens, let me ask you this. Why were you speaking with an accent when we picked you up? Was I? Uh, yeah. I thought it'd be cool. More menacing. Yeah, you know what? It actually was kind of bad ass. 'Yeah, we're checking the phone records right now.' We'll nail him on something. But in the meantime 'You're safe.' He's not getting out of here anytime soon. I want to see him. Oh, I'm sorry Fiona. I can't allow that. He's my father and until today I didn't even know that he was alive-- Yeah, and probably the guy who killed your boyfriend. It's not going to happen. Listen, if you want, I can take him out back and beat the shit out of him, but that's probably the best I can offer. [call ends tone] Hello? Hello. Cunt. How do you open these things? Tits or GTFO! Hashtag you're an asshole! Just do it! Hashtag pervert! Hey, stop bitch, you're gonna get the camera wet! I feel stupid. Hashtag I'm a potato What? [camera shutter clicks] No, you guys actually look pretty decent. Must not fap! Idiot. Uh, can we get this over with already? Don't ruin the mood, Fiona! Come on, let's have some fun here, baby! This is the greatest day of my life. Yeah, check out my hos. Um, excuse me? We can use my hose to spray water in the air. Might make for a cool shot. Yeah, but remember you don't have to do anything you don't want to. [imitating]: You don't have to do anything you don't want to! No, I'm just saying! [imitating]: No, I'm just saying! That's pretty funny, Steve. No it's not, bitch! How much longer are we doing this? [imitating]: How much longer? What? I'm kidding, Fiona, come on now! Seriously, how much longer? I don't know, another hour. Maybe ten? [laughs] I wild each it That meets their naked. You know, crossing your arms won't hide an erection. Oh my God. Sorry! Damn, who knew? Brian's packin' some serious heat. Man, get outta here! No, it's okay! Look, it's gone. You're embarrassing me! Come on, Steve! Out! [screams] [screams] I hate my life! I hate my life! [screams] I'm gonna run away and never come back so you never have to see me again! [screams] Yo! Shut up, moron! [screams] I hate you! [screams] [grunts] I hate my life! I hate you, Steve! Is this what you want?! Is this what you want?! [screams] [door slam] Somebody should go check on him. Whatever, man. Seriously, somebody go check on him. All right, I'll go. But you girls better still be naked when I get back. Hey Brian, you okay in there? Does your brother have any enemies? Come on. It's Fiona's dad. My dad's in jail. No, it wasn't Fiona's father. He's not going anywhere. He could, however, have an accomplice. An extraterrestrial one. I wonder who's going to die next. Hey, wait a second! No, no, no. Could be anyone. No one really knows how these life forms operate. It's probably going to be the slutty girl. Wait. And then, more than likely, the Oriental. Can't you protect us? Yes. Well, what should we do then? Listen. We're going to get whoever's behind this no matter what we have to do or Or what we have to... What? Jet fuel can't melt steel beams. [phone vibrates] Who's calling Brian? Hello. Hello? [sinister laughter] Who is this? 'U mad?' Who is this? Hello? Hello! Listen you little punk! I'm going to find you, no matter where you are or what you are. [sinister laughter] 'Good luck!' 'I'm behind seven proxies.' Seven what? Seven proxies? Listen, don't give me this alien gibberish! Hello! Hello! Hello? Who was that? You kids better get home. Hey guys Once again, I am looking for a girlfriend. But now I got a chest I got a six pack and I am back to tell you no chest, no sex! So I am back and I am looking for a girlfriend. Alright? So if you know a girl who's single and who can't resist my sexy body tag her right now because I am looking for a girl to sleep on my body to feel my chest and to hold hands with and have sex with me Because now, I got a chest I got a six pack and I am looking for a girlfriend. [phone vibrates] Hey you. Phil, I can't find anything about this mask. The thing is, I can't even remember what I saw anymore. Everything's a blur. Well, you were in shock. I don't think I'd remember anything either. [email notification] 'I don't know.' Huh 'What?' What is it? -Phil? -I'm here. 'Phil, thanks for always being there for me.' You're my best friend, you know. In fact, you know, I think of you as more than a friend. 'Uhh...' Me too. I also think of you as more than a friend. I think of you like a brother. Have you heard anything from the police at all? No. Nothing. I hate this. We've got nothing. Can't they just trace the call? I hope so. That's the only lead that they have, otherwise we're totally-- 'Wait a second.' What? Holy shit. 'What? What? What is it?' Are you in front of your computer right now? 'Yeah.' All right, hang on. 'I think we may have a picture of the killer.' 'Was that the same guy you saw?' Yeah. [typing] 'I'm gonna post this on some forums.' Maybe someone out there knows something. [door slams] Hey, I gotta go. I'll call you back, okay? Okay. Why aren't you studying? It's summer. Good! You have more time to study. I'm sorry, dad. I'm just trying to find out who killed my friend. Oh, you want to be detective? Why not A-tective? Study first. Solve murder later. Less Facebook. More face in book. When I was your age, I never wasted time on Facebook. You didn't even have Facebook. I had real book! [imitating]: I had real book! Two friends in two weeks. One friend, and Steve's nerdy little brother. He was sweet. Hashtag adorable. [footsteps] Thanks for the coffee. My pleasure. Mmmm Once you go black, you don't go back Mmm. Because the cream and sugar hide all the flavor. I guess this means one of us is next. Hashtag I'm too young to die. I bet Phil's doing this. He's totally obsessed with Fiona. Not a chance, Phil? He's way too nice of a guy. Hashtag nice guys finish last. He's totally in love with Fiona. I don't really know why. Well, he better make his move soon because Steve seems to like Fiona too. And what if Steve-O's the killer? I mean, I always thought he was kind of stupid, but he is kind of a dick. Not a chance. I've known Steve my whole life, he's harmless. Then I guess it's one of us. Or maybe it's Fiona. How well do any of us even know her anyway? I mean, she was the only one there when Clarence died, right? Now you sound crazy. No, hear me out. She's got her abandonment issues, her dad up and leaves and her crazy overprotective mother. She was in the tub when Brian died. They were all in there. Exactly. Look guys, it's not Fiona. It's not Steve. It's some deranged psychopath, and until we figure out who it is we have to stick together and watch each other's backs. I'll watch your back. Hey! Hashtag get a room. What's the matter, Kerry? Not interested in a little trick or treating? Now I didn't say that. Whoa... whoa... Yo, yo, yo, I'm turnt up in the spot. My boy, Kerry, and his girl, Stacy are over here and Fiona, hey baby girl. This video is just for you. Hey, sexy girl. You know I have your back all day, baby. All day! [taser crackling] So who's tryin to front? I'll be up all in your ass In your ass! In your ass! What do we got here? Let's see what this does. [taser crackling] Did he just tase himself? Mm hmm! Aw shit! Steve! Steve! Here, help me with him. No babe, I gotta go. Library's going to close. Just help me get him up. No... I'll talk to you tonight, okay? Yeah, yeah. Can't believe you even know where the library is. Why's Stacy going to the library? [typing] [typing] [typing] [typing] [typing] [typing] [unknown beep] [screams] [punches] [hard hit] [unknown beep] Somebody has to know something. No replies at all? Nothing serious. [email notification] Wait, who's that? Who's Violet Pepper? No one. It's no one. No, come here, I want to see! She's just some girl. She emailed me a few weeks ago. She's cute! She's not that cute. What, are you kidding me? Elbows too pointy. 6 out of 10 at best. She would be lucky to meet a guy like you. Any girl would. She's probably a guy, using fake pictures, like 90% of the girls on the Internet. No, hey wait, if you look at this link She has to record herself saying that. "The little black dog jumped over the silver car." She's real. Wow. Hmm... Just got all these cute girls contacting you I'm kind of jealous. They're not as beautiful as you Isn't it weird that we haven't hooked up before? Why haven't we hooked up before? [awkward laughter] Ahh, what's going on in here? Should we leave? Where's Stacy? I thought that she was coming with you. She is comin', oh yeah! Easy there, tiger. Jerk! Where did you post the picture? On 4Chan and reddit and a couple of paranormal sites. Did anyone reply? Not yet I don't think. Checking right now. [phone vibrates] Hello. Hi, hey, hang on a second, I'm going to put you on speaker phone. Okay, we're all here. Can you say that again? Yeah so, we had to let your father go. Why? Well, your friend Brian was killed while your dad was in jail, I mean 'He couldn't have done it.' How do you know that he wasn't involved somehow? Listen. We can't just hold someone without any evidence. 'But this is a good thing, right?' 'I mean, your father couldn't have done it.' It means your dad's innocent. Yeah, but now you have no idea who killed my little brother. What about the call? Did you trace the call? No. Why not? 'Why can't you trace the call?' Because we lost the phone records. What do you mean, lost? So... I accidentally the evidence. What does that mean? Yeah, I accidentally the evidence. The whole thing. Listen guys, I, um, I teach a self-defense class and I don't necessarily believe you're in any eminent danger But... maybe stop by. Couldn't hurt, right? Okay. Thanks. I guess. [call ends tone] Slut. Hashtag we're so screwed. No, we're not. We'll figure this out. Promise. If the police can't do anything, what can we do? Oh, there has to be something missing. There's gotta be. [email notification] Wait, guys. Check this out. Holy wall of text, Batman. Fuck readin' all that, man. My name is Rav. I want to meet. I've been following this case for the past three years. I've attached a video. This killer seems to target people with popular videos online. "Here in my garage, I just bought this new Lamborghini" "But you know what I like more than materialistic things?" Knowledge. In fact, I'm a lot more proud of these bookshelves I had installed to hold the 848,331 books that I bought. I read a book a day not to show off but again, it's about the knowledge. And the real reason I keep this Lamborghini here is that it's a reminder Oh no. "A reminder that dreams are still possible" Because it wasn't that long ago I was still sleeping on my mother's couch with $25 in my own butt crack but I don't even think of it as money anymore. I think of it as fuel units, and I use those fuel units. I use these fuel units to get mentors. People like Warren Buffett, "Steve Jobs, Bill Gates" and Bill Nye and with these mentors, you can follow my 67 step program. And I'm not saying you can get here tomorrow but you can get there faster than you think and you can have knowledge and you can be like me, here in the Hollywood Hills and read books with your Lamborghinis and drive Lamborghinis while reading books-- [metal on concrete scrape] Did he died? I don't know. What's all this mother dying in her sleep stuff? I always reply. Yeah, me too. Me too, thanks. Wait Fiona, you don't have any popular videos online, do you? Just that one of my dogs. I don't know how many views it has though. [chat notification] Answer it. Wait Should we? Do it, do it. But this could be anyone. Just do it. Do it, Phil. Do it, buddy, come on, write back. [chat notification] Write back. What should I write? Call him a bitch. Wait, what if this isn't even the guy? He has to know something. He's got to. No, it's probably a prank because you were dumb enough to post it on 4Chan! I was anonymous. Hashtag you're never anonymous. Wait. I know. Try this. [typing] Maybe we'll get lucky. [typing] Play it. I don't get it. He's supposed to say that sentence. Holy shit. Turn it off! Turn it off! Oh my God. Stacy. [chat notification] [typing] [chat notification] What? [chat notification] Is that English? cash mee au-sy-deh? It's gotta be some kind of code. Cash. Where do you get cash? At a bank? Or an ATM? Maybe he wants money. Maybe it's French. oh-seet, ha-bo-dah [chat notification] Outside! He's outside! Catch me outside! But what's "how bo da"? I don't know. Well... Let's not keep him waiting. [footsteps] Kerry, wait a second! Guys? [chat notification] [typing] [chat notification] [typing] [chat notification] [crickets] Where is he? Oh, he's gone. He's scared. Yeah You're scared, little man? Come at me bro! I will knock you the fuck out, man! I'm serious. I'll do that. Oh, he's gone. He's long gone. Let's get outta here. Hey Phil Call me later, okay? Okay. [car alarm beeps] [engine starts] [shifter moves] [shifter moves] Hey, what was his name again? Rav? Are you sure this is it? So which one of you is Phil? [sad music] Come on in. Well obviously, we have a killer in Lincoln Park. He's climbing up in people's windows, snatching them up. So you all need to hide your kids, hide your wife Hide your husband, because he's killing everybody out here. Who is he? A better question might be, what is he? From what I've been able to gather, this is a demon. It attaches itself to you and it murders everyone you know. Your dad? He's not your dad anymore. It's a demon. It's taken over his body. Why me? It could happen to any of you. What happens when we're all dead? It just moves on to the next group of people. Wait a second. How do you know all this? I'm a survivor. I went into hiding to protect my friends and family. Can you kill it? Yes... We can. All of us together. Why don't you just tell the police what you know? You want to tell the police that a demon is coming after you? Well, what do you propose we do then? Still got your brother's phone? The police couldn't do it, what makes you think you can? [typing] Do you need help? I know HTML. How will that be useful, exactly? It's programming. Not really. Dumbass. The police have sophisticated computer guys these days. If they couldn't do it, I doubt that you can-- I'm in! Really? How? He's Indian, bro! Just got to pull up his, uh, address and profile picture which is private, by the way. Rav for the win. That's your guy. Do you know him? Well, why don't we go say hi? How inconspicuous do you think we're going to look in that car? What do you mean? This is a stakeout. I bet that car's crazy loud. Hell yeah! There's a bus every 15 minutes. Let's just go when it's dark [crickets] There he is. [keys jingle on ground] Everyone know what to do? Let's do this. [screams] That's my biggest fear! [grunts] Hold him! Wait... wait... wait... Holy water, bitch! What the hell, man? He's not burning! Yeah, no shit. Who the hell are you guys? You killed three of our friends! I didn't kill anybody. Bullshit, we traced the call. I didn't kill anybody. Every single victim got a call from your phone. I didn't call anyone. Who did, then? I don't know! My phone-- Ooh, dis gon b gud. My phone was stolen. Hashtag that's convenient. I'm serious! My phone was stolen a few weeks ago. Right. I saw Scream too. You're going to have to come up with something better than that! Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait... WAIT! I can prove it. How? I just need my tablet. Easy now, you don't want to hurt yourself. The idiot's still logged into the cloud. I'm getting all the pictures. He even took a selfie. Look. [gasp] There's your killer. Who is that? Who is that? [muffled techno music] Damn girl, look at you, mmm! Nice. Show a little respect, jackass. What did you say? I said show the lady a little respect! Yeah, why don't you mind your own business, old man! What? What did you say? Steve, stop it! Your hearing gone, old man? I said, why don't you mind your own business? Whoa, whoa... Just please, back off, sir. Walk away. I beat the shit out of guys like you every day! Say it again! Say it again! I'll shove my foot up your ass! Please, please... Just back off. Kick his ass! [punch] [hard impacts on bus seats] Oh my God, stop! [punches] Stop it! I told you not to fuck with me! Get away!

Perfect, alright listen! Everybody calm down. I'm a professional. Oh boy, I'm losing some blood in there. Where are you going? That idiot can't figure anything out. There's no way. Hashtag accidents happen. Yo man, that was just getting good! What are we going to do now? We can run. Yeah, because that worked out so well for Rav. Wait. We know where he lives. Right. [engine turns off] [door opens] I don't get it. Says we're here. You must've put the wrong address in. I put in the address you gave me. It was right, right? Yeah, it was right. Hashtag we're in Bumblefuck. Man, nothing's here. This place gives me the creeps. No signal. Yeah, why would there be signal? Can't tell if this place is peaceful or creepy.

And golf clubs, right? Back in the car. Whatever. Bat's good enough. What if he's got a gun? Wait, are you sure? I don't know. [knocks] Fiona, what are you doing here? What am I doing here? You're supposed to be dead! You can't be here! What, you ain't gonna invite us in, bro? Relax, Steve. Okay, come on. Get inside. Hurry up. Come on. Just relax, relax! Calm down! Don't touch those. You murder people with some fancy ass shit. Hey, they're strictly for self defense. Of course. What do you use to murder people with then? I guess I owe you an explanation. You think? Someone's after me, or, something, maybe. And it wants nothing more than to hurt you. I thought if I left, you'd be safe. And it worked. For 20 years it worked. Why? I was young and stupid. And I offered myself to be a host for this entity. -Whatever, man. -A demon. I just wanted us to have a good life. The best life. But it didn't want me. My body was too sick and poisoned from the drugs. Aww yeah! [weak slap] Now you're the one that it's after. Cool story, bro. I don't believe you. I wish I were making this up. Why would you make a deal with a demon? Yeah. Haven't you seen like every movie ever? I'm paying for the mistakes I made when I was young. I'm paying every day. I just want to make sure you're not paying for them too. How did it find me? -Facebook. -Dammit! I told you! I told you to change your privacy settings. No one ever listens to me. You and your privacy settings. And? [imitating]: Annnd? Come on, guys! Should we leave? No, it already knows we're here. The only thing we can do now is prepare. [crickets] Admit it. I'm right. About what? About the privacy thing. Fiona should've set her Facebook to private. They still could have found her. How? I don't know. I don't know this Internet shit. You just won't admit it, will you? Admit what? That I'm not always wrong. You're not always right, either. Hashtag you're an asshole. Wait, wait, wait... Go to hell! Alright, I'll admit it. Admit what? You know what. Say it. You're not wrong all the time. Hashtag progress, I guess. I can't find Phil's post. I think it got deleted. [chat notification] What is that? It's him.

Where is she? Did you leave her alone? Hey, I said no one leaves no one else alone! We can beat this demon. How? We have to work together. He only attacks when we're weak or when we're alone.

Your dad has a ton of shit up in here. [martial arts whaa!] Whoa! Let me see those! We need to get back to the car. In the dark? If we take that trail down there, I think we'll... What? -What is it? -Oh no. Shit! What, hey wait, wait, wait! I have to get her! You think he's not waiting for you out there? What am I supposed to do, Fiona? I'm the one that he wants.

[mysterious aircraft noises] Hell yeah, motherfucker! Hey Brian, get over here! What's taking so long? Hey Fiona. Hi, baby girl. Everything's okay. Don't worry about it. Everything's okay. I love you more than there are grains of sand on every beach, on every planet on every galaxy of the universe. You mean more to me than golden diamonds mean to the greediest burglars. I hope you enjoy watching this, baby girl. I love you. ey, whatever this is... whatever this is, it's not right. What page are you reading? The page, the words, they're right there. There's nothing on there! There's nothing... there's no words! What - what does it mean? What, the other side? What does that mean? Over there. The other side. Over there, what? The other side of the door? -Is that where? -Yeah. Yeah. Alright. Alright, go, go, go! Come on. Come on! And five four three Fuck, I can't...! Fuck! Fuck it, I can't - I can't fucking-- I can't do this! I can't - Fuck it! We'll do it live! I'll write it! We'll do it live! Fuck it! Fucking thing sucks! I really admire his work. I was psyched when I got the chance to work with him on this project. But, yeah... After a while I realized that everything might look spontaneous, but careful planning goes into each scene. I didn't realize that until I became the one doing all the prep work. I mean, I scrubbed that garbage bin for like six hours, and in the end, he wouldn't even get in! So I had to climb in and I got blamed for breaking the mask because I let that guy punch me in the face. It took me three days to make that goddam mask! Three days! And I didn't even get a thank you? That's where it hurts the most. Don't get me wrong, I'm not complaining. I'm just a camera guy, after all. I'm not asking for fame or for money. All I'm saying is a little 'thank you' once in a while. What about the garbage bin? What? How did you get out of the garbage bin? You just disappeared. How'd you do that? Oh, it's just this trick that I learned. It's very easy. Let me show you. Yeah, buddy! Our video hit two million views today. Oh, we're going to be so rich, bro! 'Did we make the Top Ten?' 'How many do we--?' [grunting and choking] Hey... Hey Mike? Mike, you there? Hey Mike! What?
