Ladies. Hello. -Not too tired? -No. -There, Ma'am. -About time! -Do you have my saccharin? -Of course, Ma'am. -Hello. -Hello. If you'll come with me. I want it totally redecorating. Very well, Ma'am. -As planned. -Valérie. Yes? Your pantyhose. This way, gentlemen. -Hello, Mrs. Zaros. -Ma'am. -Hello there. -Hello. Have you studied the plans? Yes, and I'd like to make a few changes. I'd like the kitchen here, separated from the restaurant by windows. Really? Kitchens are usually hidden. That's a mistake. I want some darker nooks here, separated by different-colored glass. -Really? -Absolutely. One can eat more peacefully, without seeing one's neighbor's food. -And eat more! -The portions will be smaller. They'll be hemmed in and it'll make them feel slimmer. -Hello, darling. -Hello. -Sorry I'm late. My chef quit. -How awful! I couldn't find a taxi, then all the lights were red. I'll redecorate too. You need blue, lots of blue! I need advice about the menu. Just do the same as me. Don't name the dishes or give the prices, only the calories. They have to know what they're eating. No need. I'll show you my new menus. Excuse me. They'll feel they're losing weight as they eat. Knock that wall down. We're knocking down the one opposite. That one too. It won't cost me more. Very well. A restaurant in a slimming club has a double purpose. -You slim in there... -Put in back on in here… And round again! Looks like someone's broken down. Darling, we're late as it is. You're not going to stop? What are you doing? They can manage. We can't just ignore them in this rain. -What is it? -I don't know, I stalled. Try the ignition. -It's not working. -Try again. Okay, stop. I don't know what it is. -Look… -The distributor is wet. -Can you take me to a taxi? -Of course. Wipe your hands. Look at them. Always the same with you! We'll be late. I'm sorry. There'll be taxis at the end of the avenue. Every time we go out together something happens. -Screw you! -You think that's an elegant thing to say? -Get out. -What's got into you? There are taxis there. Hurry up. Get out. Where do you live? Go straight ahead, I'll give you directions. Goodbye. Thank you. You're welcome. Can I make a phone call? -There. -Thank you. Hello? Can I talk to Timakoff, please? Yes. Who's speaking? Kelvo. Kelvo! Hi. I've been held up. I know. Florence just got here. -She's there? -I just told you. Oh, dear! I'm not coming. Where are you racing on Sunday? -Montlhéry. The French Grand Prix. -Who's your co-driver? We only have one car entered, and I'm driving. It's Michel. Will I see you soon? -You bet. -See you. See you. With two ice cubes, please. Two. Relax. If you don't need anything else, you can leave. My watch. I do need something else. Calm down. Nice and easy. -I'm going to explode! -What's wrong? Are you trying to kill me? It's far too hot! -It's nothing, Ma'am. -What? I can't breathe! Where's Miss Alny? Get me a doctor! Mrs. Zaros is making a fuss again. -Where's Miss Alny? -Not here yet. Call her. Yes? I'm sorry to bother you. Mrs. Zaros is making a fuss, saying we must call a doctor. Call Dr. Lasalle. Very well. What time are you coming in? Cancel my appointments. I'm not coming today. Goodbye. And then? The driver tried to help me out, but the engine was flooded. I got a taxi home. Yes? Thanks. Your car is at the pound. -Thanks. Can I go and get it? -It's at your disposal. Thank you, goodbye. CAR POUND Is something bothering you? No, I'm fine. Are you still going to Étretat? -I have my room booked. -What an idea! It's sad and cold. The sea never seems sad to me. Is a two-month renovation too long? No, your customers will put on weight! They'll come running when you reopen. And don't worry. I'll keep an eye on the work for you. -What does Pierre mean to you? -A certain tenderness. He makes me feel a woman. He's my accomplice too. You've never wanted to leave him? To live alone? I'd have no reason to do so. When he's not there, I feel so awkward. I almost feel diminished. How does he act towards you? You know, marriage is like a potluck dinner. You get out what you put into it. If you put nothing into it, you get nothing out of it. How would you react if a man raped you? That's an odd question. I'd have to want it first. Even just a little bit. And then… it'd depend on the pleasure I got. Why? No reason. I was just wondering. I think... I'd get revenge. What ideas you have! The Matra, number ten, is driven by Kelvo and Michel. The Matra, number ten, which is in the lead, has made a pit stop. Looking for a taxi? Yes. You're the one who broke down. It's fixed. Get in. Thanks. All right? Yes, fine. Is this on your way? Yes. You can drop me there, anywhere. I don't feel like going home. Can I buy you a drink? That'd be nice. Yes, I know, I talk too much. When I'm with him I talk and talk. Because I'm in love. Otherwise I don't say a word. I've been with some guys and not said a word. They did nothing for me. It's different with him. He doesn't say a word for hours, and then... he makes love to me. Without saying a thing. Even sometimes in the car. And… he disappears. He disappears for days on end. Like he's trying to get away from me. Do you have a cigarette? Yes. -Here. -Thanks. May I? -What do you want? -To ask you to dance. I don't want to. -And you still don't? -No, I still don't. What does this guy want? What does he want? -Do you see him often? -Who? Him? When he wants. When he wants, he calls me. When he calls me, I go. We go to his place. It's big but it's cozy. His pals make good use of it. He leaves the keys to the apartment in his mailbox. -In his mailbox? -In his mailbox. -That's how he is. -Has he never been married? It's obvious you don't know him. He's too much of a loner for that. Darling! -You think you're smart? -Me? Don't act dumb! What is it? Explain. -I never said you could use my key. -Your key? I never have used it. And the photos? What photos? You're totally crazy! Look, I haven't seen you for a week, you haven't called me, and now you ask me about photos and your key. I don't understand! -All right! -It's always the same with you. Hello. Hello! Hello. Hello? Everything okay? I'm sure you don't have this piece of music. It's only just come out. Are you naked? Look, I don't know who you are. It's midnight. Take a taxi. You know where I live because… you have my phone number. It's on the eighth floor. The door will be open. Come in quietly, and close the door. Take off all your clothes. Walk forward in the half-light. Come to me. Place your lips on my thigh. And gently… very gently… you come… -Okay? -It's still slipping. Tell him to adjust the clutch linkage. -Adjust the clutch linkage. -Okay, I'll check that. -How's that now? -Yes, better. -You're wanted on the phone. -What? Phone! Hey, handsome! Hi. Champagne, please. -Whisky, please. -Very well. Miss Alny, I haven't seen you around town before. -How are you? -I'm not slimming anymore. -What can I do? -Buy Band-Aids. -Really? -Yes. Stick them on your lips in the morning, take them off at night. Goodnight. -Good evening. -Good evening. You see, I came. I'm even on time. Would you like a drink? Yes, I'd love one. Yes, Ma'am. A fascinating lot, your friends! What's your game? Getting to know you better. I have something to give back to you. It's yours. That was you? It was a petty sort of revenge. You should have waited for me. The door will be open. I'll come in quietly and take off all my clothes. There'll be champagne on ice. Do you often phone men at midnight? Do you often take advantage of women alone at home? It hadn't happened before? Alny, darling, introduce me to your friend. Kelvo, Brigitte. Kelvo, the champion? How wonderful! I'll introduce him to our friends. Come, my dear man. Friends, it's Kelvo, the champion. You know? The racing driver. -Mrs. de Roussel. -Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am. Good evening. Ma'am. Hello, Ma'am. Sir. Good evening. Good evening, Ma'am. Good evening, Ma'am. Sir. Pierre! I must introduce you to my husband. Pierre! Pierre! There you are. Allow me to introduce Kelvo, our champion. Pleased to meet you. I admire you very much. Good evening. I like racing cars. I have a car myself… Goodbye. Ma'am. -Coming for dinner tonight? -No, I'm too tired. I'm going home. As you wish. Don't see me out. -Goodbye, darling. -Goodbye. Here. Hello. Hold the line, please. You're wanted on the telephone. Yes? Hello, it's Kelvo. Hello? You can go, I'll lock up. -Very well. Goodnight. -Goodnight. -Yes? -Kelvo here. It's you! Yes, it's me. How did you get my number? What does it matter? What are you doing tonight? That's bad timing. I'm very busy, I have three appointments. What a shame. If you were free, you could have come with me. Where? To a friend's place. He's having a… party. His name's Timakoff. T, I, M, A, K, O, F, F. 25 Boulevard des Tilleuls, in Orgeval. By the westbound highway. It's not far from Paris. In a leafy street, opposite a lake. I'm afraid that's impossible. Ouch! I'll be there, anyway. -Goodbye. -Goodbye. Have some chicken. It's tasteless. This roast is disgusting. Caviar. It turns your stomach. Lobster salad. Smells bad. This, on the other hand, is divine. As for dessert, there are plenty of girls. You can manage by yourself. I already have. She's beautiful. I'm not sure she'll come, but if she does we'll have fun. I doubt she'll stay ten minutes. Then why did you invite her? A score to settle. You haven't been to see me race for a while. When I see you driving, I'm jealous. You seem too happy. You should make the most of it. It may not last long. Do you know what bothers me about you? What? You have a 20-year-old's smile on a 40-year-old's face. I can never work out where your head is. Nowhere. I was ready to overtake. So I started overtaking him, but he cut me up, not letting me. And what was I doing while this was going on? Checking the stopwatch! Don't listen to him, it's all nonsense. You're looking very elegant. Hello, Kelvo, how are you? Anyway, I'll carry on. So, he's got me hemmed in... Thanks. -Good evening. -Good evening. -You managed to get free? -It was very difficult, but… I can imagine. Anyway, you came. There are too many people here. Your fellows, your brothers... Maybe not. The more, the merrier. Is that your motto? If you were a man, would we be friends? Who's talking about friendship? I don't know. You're talking about my fellows, my brothers, so... I'm trying to understand you. All those we like are similar. And everyone else? We have to put up with them. And they fill up our loneliness. I don't follow. Of course not. You're a distant beach to which no one comes close. I'm a black soul with a halo of light, which slips into the heart by surprise. Poet or bluffer? A bit of both. As I suspected! -No! Not you. -Why not? Are there bedrooms upstairs? -If you start something, finish it! -So? Your lousy striptease may make your friends' husbands swoon, but not me! Come and have a lesson! Sit down. Look and learn. They at least don't cheat. Two whiskies. All these people are like you. They want to see naked flesh but not seem like perverts. Their impunity is assured. Do you know why? Because of the curtain. The curtain is a great moral invention. Even when raised its shadow is there, reassuring. You're the same. You see life through a curtain. You fidget and fidget… tiring yourself out. And at the last moment you walk away. Watch. Applaud. Here. I'll be waiting for you. LEAVE THE KEY BY THE TELEPHONE I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU AGAIN Frédérique, have you tried that number? -No answer. -Call every ten minutes. L'Équipe phoned, wanting an interview. Thanks. There you are! You're all here, perfect. We can start. Sit down, gentlemen. In Italy the top makes will be taking part. We've decided to make a major effort. We're going to enter two cars, which will be driven by Kelvo and Michel. I want you at the peak of physical fitness. -When do we go? -Next week. We have a good chance this year. Our chance depends on our fitness. Monza is a very fast track. Breathing plays an important part. This is why you must be in great physical shape. Our rivals have prepared with the greatest care. You've watched their races and raced against them. Porsche is very strong. Ferrari isn't far behind. In this race which, as I said, is basically one of speed, right from the start you will have to... -Well? -Now it's busy. Who's there? Hello. Hello. How are you? While she's away I look after her plants. I'll have to take them all to my place. Didn't she leave any message for me? Yes. The key. I'm to get it back. -You haven't lost it? -No. Does she often disappear like this? She hasn't disappeared, she's gone away. -If you see her, tell her… -I won't see her for a month. Can you give me the key? When the bird has flown, the key has no use. Where is she? Étretat. She goes every year. Alone. -If you see her, tell her… -Not for a month. That's right, I forgot. Well, if she phones. She might... phone? Tell her that… Tell her to get some rest. She needs it. I'll be sure to. We've been expecting you for two weeks. I thought you were sick, or married. Thanks for saving the same room. I'm redecorating it next year. But for now you'll feel at home. -It never changes out there. -It does. The sea keeps advancing. Not much. An inch or so every year. One more wave. -Leave them there. -Yes, Ma'am. -Do you remember Madeleine? -Yes. She was with me for ten years, and then... -What? -She's working in Paris. She dreamt about the various districts. One day a guest told her that each district has a different atmosphere. Do you realize? She's getting all the atmospheres now. She's a ticket inspector on the buses! Is the park ranger still here? On vacation! Yes, he's still here. But without his uniform. Now he's in civilian clothes he thinks he's on vacation. -And your cousin? -Jean-Pierre? He's here. He picked those lovely flowers. They still smell of the sea. -Well, I'll see you later. -Yes. -Is it this way? -That's right. What are you looking for? The shampoo. On the right, above the bath. Found it? Of course. But it's not my brand. It's freezing! I'm too cold. Now it's too hot. Are you tired? I drove 200 km to see you. Why? To find out if I'm alone here? If not that, then why? You left without saying a word. -Maybe I did it on purpose. -We could have come together. I chose a more romantic solution. It looks like a postcard. "Having a great time here in Étretat." You never change. It took me 40 years to see things as they are. Waves, seagulls, and cliffs lost their charm long ago. I came here for you. It's true. I didn't even have breakfast. Come on, let's get something to eat. There. Thank you. Excuse me. Thank you. -Not eating anything? -No. I'll smoke a cigarette first. The air here doesn't suit you. We'll go to Italy. How long will it take you to pack? Is there anything keeping you here? No one. But I like this landscape. Each pebble has a different color and shape. I want to make the most of it. Isn't it enough for me to be here? I don't know. I have to think about it. -I'm going for a walk. Want to come? -No. It's ridiculous. There's a plane at noon. There'll be others. You've never given me flowers. Flowers are for weddings and funerals. I don't think they matter. I do. Hello. Hello. Want to come fishing with me tomorrow? Why not? You'll have to wake me early. -You can count on me. -See you. You wanted flowers? There! There's a clinic here, get treatment! I'll teach you to live again. Here, you wanted flowers! Keep them for your young girls. Leave me alone! You don't want flowers? Here, have some cauliflowers! -You're crazy! -Here, have some leeks! Here, some carrots! And potatoes! Get out of my sight! Just get out of my sight! Don't come after me! You can rot here! I left my friends, you'll pay for that! They're your slaves, not your friends. Go to them! There! There! And your friends are like undertakers! Pissing out calories! Go and race, you have no crowds watching here! I'm going! But don't bother me any more! Screw you! I never want to see you again! He's insane. -You've bought more? -Yes. And the lunatic settled up before he left. Come here! Let's go for a walk, huh? MATRA-KELVO, WORLD CHAMPIONS? Accept them. Accept my last invitation too. It's too silly to part on bad terms. Thank you. -Very good. -Thanks, that's fine. A big expense for a farewell dinner! Is the champagne cool enough? It's very good. If I'd known, I'd have worn a dress. We're almost alone, Alny. Listen carefully. I was clumsy. Ill-mannered and arrogant. But when I like something I just take it. Sometimes I realize later that it was a fragile object. You speak better when you're alone. Listen. This thing between us, which began as a game, has become, in spite of myself, the most important thing in my life. It's simple. I care about you. You may smile. I need you. I'd like to believe you. But in you I see everything in life that I hate. Power, selfishness, indifference. I've never been able to speak words of love. But… I'm impatient to prove to you that I love you. It's easy with words. In an atmosphere like this. Tomorrow, in your car, you'll change your mind. -It'll be the same as before. -No, Alny. I'm never going to hold you back, Kelvo. You know that. Thanks for the dinner. One day Cain… kills Abel. His parents show up and see Abel sleeping. They want to wake him up. They thought he was asleep. No one had died before him. They couldn't know that he was dead. How did they realize he was dead? Yeah, how? By his absence. -How much do I owe you? -That'll be two francs. He no longer moved. And it went on and on and on. He was no longer there. Absent. Hey, sailor, wait for me! I've got some here. Give that to me. Here we go! Watch out! Look! Alny! Alny! Alny! Alny! Enough! Do you hear me? If a girl caused me to die, it'd be of laughter! There are dozens of bourgeois women like you after me, their arms full of flowers, after every race! It's true. You believed that stuff I taped, huh? That was just to fool you! You weren't fooled. Very good, hats off to you! But my life begins now! That's what independence is! Do you understand? Boy scout! I'm going to call the police. Jean-Pierre, call the police. Okay. -Jean-Pierre. -Yes? Wait. Come here. Look at that! Look! Look at that. -Come on, let's go for a drink. -Yeah, a good idea. Alny! Alny! You can't do this to me! Open up! Open the door! Why are you playing this out in front of me? I'll smash the door down. You wouldn't understand. Do you hear me? Open up! Alny! I want to talk to you. Come here. I have to explain. Don't be so stubborn. Can you hear me? We have to have a serious talk. Come on! I'm really calm now. It's not about carrots and leeks anymore. Come on! Alny! Alny! You'll regret it, I'll stay here all night. Do you think he'll stay there all night? You can't get rid of me like that. He's drunk. I'm going to stay here all night! And I'm going to shout! -If you keep this up… -Gin. ...I'll throw pebbles through the windows. You're lucky. I'm really sleepy too. Jean-Pierre, could you draw the drapes? -I'll stay here all night! -Very well. Alny! Alny! No, not that! Bastard! Bastard! You're going to have some fun, huh? But you can't forget me! Draw back the drapes! -Goodnight all the same. -Goodnight. Draw back those drapes right now! Alny, you're crazy! Don't do that, it's not reasonable. You can't leave me outside like this, it's not nice. It's cold, for one thing. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? I'll stop you sleeping! A flower in the hat, a song on the lips A joyful and sincere heart That is all we good fellows need To go to the ends of the earth The republic is calling us Let us conquer and let us die A Frenchman must live for that Must live for that, for that, a Frenchman must live for... Here's some blood sausage, some blood sausage Some blood sausage Here's some blood sausage, some blood sausage... The sea at Étretat When winter rages With a savage beauty Which I see in you Its sudden madness Is unleashed in waves Foaming with hatred But still beautiful And you, like the sea Furious beneath the storm You crush as you pass All who get in your way Your heart is more bitter Than the stale water on the beach And is as cold As the pebbles of Étretat The pebbles of Étretat The sea at Étretat Has no particular color Sometimes blue, sometimes gray Like your eyes at times Calm or in a fury It rushes to the shore Which it strokes or batters Depending on its mood And you…
