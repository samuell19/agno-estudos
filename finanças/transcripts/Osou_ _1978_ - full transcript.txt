Asami Ogawa Youko Azusa Aoi Nakajima Kai Atou Shu Ichikita Yuri Risa Wow! Amazing! Director: Yasuharu Hasebe Josai Police Station I'll move it right now! Sorry. Show us your driving licence. I was just doing some quick errands. You've been more than two hours. Please overlook it. I swear it won't happen again. A rule is a rule. Please! You'll be arrested if you don't pay the fine. Goodbye. Damn it! Sorry. I really want to buy something. All right. Thank you. Collect me later, I'll be on 3rd Street. OK. It's me. It's Tamura I heard you'd had a car accident. What's wrong? Are you well? While I was busy doing traffic control, she was involved in a hit-and-run accident. Was she injured? She doesn't seem to have been, but she's shut herself in her room, because of the shock. - I'm sorry. - No. You aren't responsible. I hope it isn't serious. Why didn't you let Tamura into your room last night? He was very worried about you. Kumiko, I have a problem. My aunt suddenly wants to come to Tokyo to see me. So, please help me out again! Sorry for bothering you, as always! Be careful of traffic accidents. Stop! Stop! Shut up! This alcohol is... - What are you doing? - Set me free! - Look! It's that policewoman. - What? Are we safe? What to do? Oops! It doesn't matter. Don't worry! Policewoman, what's the matter? Making love in a car is a traffic violation? - Where is Kanai? - Over there. - You're noisy. - What? The policewoman from "that time" wants to talk with you. What's the matter? I want to hear something from you. Get on with it! Hey! We're cold with the door open. I'm cold! You still hate me, don't you? Hate you? Yes, I do! Because of you I got fines for causing bodily harm and obstructing an official in the performance of her duties, as well as a traffic violation. Moreover, I was expelled from the university I'd just entered. Since that expulsion, I'm a spoiled son-of-a-bitch, only good at driving cars at breakneck speeds! I hate you? Needless to say! Bitch! Where were you yesterday afternoon? Why do you ask that? Please let me know the answer! If you're suspecting me for some reason, you're making a mistake. Yesterday afternoon I was running in Miura peninsula, with my friends. Ask the others! Mayumi, it's true isn't it? Yes it is. Yes it is. - You're leaving already? - Bye. See you. Pardon me. Is Mr Saeki here? Mr Saeki! Nobody will come in here, as it's lunchtime. Why didn't you come yesterday? I couldn't find the time. - I wanted to see you. - Me too. Keep quiet! Don't make any loud noises! Yasuki. - Don't worry. - But... Don't worry! What do you want, policewoman? Isn't it enough for you to have suspended my licence? Really? It's her who suspended your licence? Yes, it is. Don't worry! Let it cry! He stays at home every day, without doing anything. What should we three live on? Yasuki, you stay here every day? Yes. Because I have nothing else to do. You haven't been outside? Get out, bitch! Without a job, he'll only get hungrier outside. Get out! By the way... I'm being transferred abroad. How long for? It's expected to be for 5 years, but it could be longer. I should wait until then to get married? Marriage? You've been going out with me without any intention of getting married? I've never promised marriage, so I wouldn't talk of postponing it. You seduced me first. I never had any intention... Be quiet! Someone might hear. Be quiet! Hey, girl! I expected you'd come! I've beeen waiting for you. - I came to talk about something between us. - Me too. Get in! Be careful of the step. I've been to a construction site in the mountains, and got back this morning. I thought of getting arrested for speeding again, in case you didn't come. You've been up there until yesterday? Yes. I was nearly bleeding from the nose for lack of women's company. That's why I wanted to see you. OK? - Stop! - You came here to see me? - Stop! - I love you. OK? Behave for me! Hey! Girl! Hey, girl! Wait! - I'm sorry - I'll follow you. - OK. I'm sorry about last night. I want to talk with you properly. Today I'll have to observe that serial rapist. See you. How about going for a drink tonight? I'll pay to thank you for your kindness. I'm somehow eager to get drunk. I have to go to somewhere tonight. I see. That's unfortunate. - Here's your nightgown. - Thanks. As it takes less than an hour from the police dormitory to here, you should come back here sometimes. We're only two sisters. - Sister. - What? No... Nothing. You said you had something to talk about with me. Nothing. It's not important. You're strange. By the way, brother-in-law is always late like this? Yes, he works overtime in a club or in a mahjong house. - Good night. - Good night. I'm back. Welcome home. - A guest? - It's Kumiko. Oh. That's unusual. It's me, Kumiko. - Don't make any noise! - Brother-in-law. What are you doing? No! Stop! Brother-in-law. Although you should know how much I love you, it's cruel of you to have left here without a word, and entered the dormitory. I married the wrong woman. I wanted to see you! Stop! Brother-in-law, I had to leave this house because of you. Kumiko! I want to hear something from you. You may know me. You must also know I'm a policewoman? Because you peep into the police dormitory. I'm a student at a preparatory school. I feel like I'm going mad, studying all day long. As I don't have the courage to speak to girls, I have no girlfriend. That's why... You haven't yet known a woman's body? - It's not you then. - What? You're going to the preparatory school? Go quickly. Then I won't be arrested? Hi! They say he stays up all night each day, to observe the serial rapist. Kumiko, are you in there? You aren't well? Kumiko, say something. What's wrong? Kumiko. In such a place! Who was it? You saw his face? He might still be near. - I'll tell them right now. - Don't do that! Why? If we do nothing, he'll get away. You don't hate him though he did this to you? Don't tell anyone about this! If they find out about it, I... - What? - Nobody knows this except me... but I thought it would be for the best to tell you. I said something I shouldn't have? Hi! Welcome. - A coffee. - All right. What did you want to talk to me about? I also have something to talk to you about. I heard about that. From Yano. From Eiko? You'd better see a doctor... in case you've caught a disease. Tamura. Don't you remember anything that could identify the criminal? To rape a policewoman in a police station - I'll never forgive him! I'll arrest him myself. Tamura, do you want to arrest him for me... or for the dignity of the police? Uh... I'll make a date with you again, after having arrested the criminal. She is pitiful. Eiko. Here I am. Sorry. As I'm not feeling well, I won't to go to work. I see. Take good care of yourself. Have a nice day. Goodbye. Eiko. It's me. Eiko. Sorry. I wondered how you were. Thank you. I'm completely better. Sorry. It wasn't good to forget to lock the door... I don't care to be found out. You're a capable detective who will surely succeed in life. Any woman may think about marrying you. Me too. Yes. All right. Mr Okubo, they're going to hold an investigation meeting. One more victim of the serial rapist You've watched me before, haven't you? Many times. I don't hate you. Believe me. At first I hated you, but now it's different. What are you saying? I don't know you at all. No! Stop it! Not with that! No! Stop! No, stop! Not with that! No! Stop! No! The bag was here. - Go this way! You go that way. - All right. Let's go to the hospital at once. If I take a little rest, I'll be all right. Rather, Tamura... do you remember your promise? You promised that you'd have a date with me if you arrested the criminal. The chief constable praised me. He said I was the model policewomen. He'll give me a reward. I see. That's nice for you. How about coming to my room tonight? I'd like to have a little celebration. How do you find my body? Pretty? Yes. Very pretty. But why are you doing this? It's Eiko. Come in. Hello! Wait! Stay with us. This way. This is such nonsense. You're right. Me, as well as you, are nonsenses - all is nonsense. It's you? I'll close my eyes. I won't shout... so do 'it' tenderly. Good. There! Who could it be, that man? Him? Or that man? Or this man? But it doesn't matter any more. Attack!!
