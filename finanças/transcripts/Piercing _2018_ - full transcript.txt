Is the baby okay? Yeah. Oh, yeah. She's fine. What are you doing? [BABY COOING] I was just checking on her. MONA: Come. I just have to work here a little bit longer. Go back to sleep. [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] MONA: You have to relax. [INDISTINCT TV CHATTER] MONA: You should sleep. [INDISTINCT TV CHATTER] REED: Yeah. [INDISTINCT TV CHATTER] MONA: Shh. REED: Hmm. Relax. Better?

[INDISTINCT TV CHATTER] It's okay. You know what you have to do, right? [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYS] REED: The victim has to be a prostitute, but what type? And she has to speak English. The terror must be in English. Once the ice pick makes its appearance, though she'll probably try to run and scream. In any case, the first step is to get her tied up and gagged, that means S&M. Of course, you need a change of clothes. There will definitely be a lot of blood. MONA: Hey, what time is the car coming? 3:00. Okay. Will you call me as soon as you get there? Uh-hmm. Uh-hmm? You can call me anytime, okay? Yeah. I mean, you can call me anytime. I mean it, okay? I'm gonna miss you. I'm gonna miss you too.

No. No, no meetings till tomorrow. But, uh, But, I gotta go to dinner. I just wanted to call, let you know that I got in. MONA: Okay. Well, have fun. We miss you. Okay. I miss you, too. I gotta run. MONA: Hold on. Hold on. Let me get the baby. Hey, wait, I... MONA: Say, "Hi, Daddy." Come on. Say, "Hi, Daddy." She's being shy. Well, we love you. Try to relax while you're there, okay? Okay. Hey, listen, Bill's at the door. I don't wanna keep the other guys waiting. MONA: Okay. I love you. All right. I love you. I love you both very, very much. MONA: I love you. I love you. I love you.

Thank you. [PAPER SHUFFLING] [TELEPHONE RINGING] JACKIE: It's Jackie. Leave a message. FRENCHIE: Hey! I haven't heard from you in days. Where the fuck is my money from the other night?

What's the nastiest thing you've ever done? [SCOFFS] Do you like to watch women masturbate? Okay. Then we'll take a shower together. I'll teach you all about the elastic band on the shower cap. Okay. [MOANING] Uh-huh. Uh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. JACKIE: It's... I'm gonna... ...take a shower. REED: Should I come with you? JACKIE [CLEARS THROAT]: Will you let me tie you up after? [WATER RUNNING] REED: Oh, shit. Hey, are you all right? Listen, I'm sorry. I wasn't laughing at you. Can you hear me? I'm sorry. [WATER RUNNING] Hey, are you all right? Hey, is everything okay? I'm coming in. Okay? JACKIE [MOANING]: REED: No, no, no, no, no. - [SCREAMS] - Okay. [PANTING] Okay. Just don't. [MELANCHOLIC MUSIC PLAYS] [TELEPHONE RINGING] BELLHOP: Uh, Mr. Curran? Is everything all right, sir? Everything's fine. BELLHOP: As you may be aware that all of our rooms are occupied tonight and some of our guests are already sleeping, so we would very much appreciate it if you can keep the volume at least as low as possible when enjoying music - or television. - All right. Of course. Um, sorry. I'll keep it down. BELLHOP: You could still kill her, though. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS] What? BELLHOP: Thanks for your cooperation, sir. Have a great night. [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYS] Are you the one that takes me to the hospital? Yeah. Do you think I can have the scissors? It's okay. It's okay. No. - No. - Don't be scared. - No. - Please drop it. Please drop it. - Please drop it. - [SCREAMS] REED [GRUNTS]: [SCREAMS] No, it's okay. It's okay. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. [BOTH] [PANTING] Okay. Okay. Okay. Hey, listen. No. Lie on your back. Please listen. Hey, can you hear me? I'm just gonna clean you up, when you wake up you need to go to the hospital, do you understand? JACKIE [GIGGLES]: Hey. Hey. - [GIGGLING] - REED: What's wrong with you? Did you take something? Hey? It's okay. Oh, God. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS] Come on. Have you seen my wife? What? MAN: My wife. I can't seem to find her. It's okay, I'll ask the front desk. Shouldn't have to bother strangers. [DOOR OPENS] [ELEVATOR BELL DINGS] Oh, no. I seem to have left something in my room. Have a good night, sir. JACKIE: Help. Help. REED: No, no, no. JACKIE: Help! Get off of me. REED [GROANS]: [GRUNTS] Hey. Hey. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, can you hear me? Can you understand me? You want to go to the hospital, right? Yeah? Okay. All right. Well, you need to get clothes on. You need to get dressed. Huh. JACKIE: I don't know where they are. Okay. All right, all right. I'll get those, stay here. Can you stand? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS] You're so calm and dignified. Hmm. Really very handsome up close. Thank you. I know why you really called me. What? You aren't here... What do you mean? [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS] [CAR ENGINE REVVING] Are you coming in? REED: Uh, no. I don't like hospitals but I'll be right here. JACKIE: Shouldn't they take a look at your hand? I... no, I'll be fine. So, you'll just be here? Yeah, of course. And you're gonna stay with me tonight? Yeah. You promise? Yeah, I promise. I think she knows. MONA: How sure are you that she knows? I don't... I don't know. MONA: A scale from one to ten. Six. That's not the worst. Yeah, but what if she saw the other stuff? Like the chloroform? REED: Yeah. You think she did? I don't know. MONA: It's gonna be fine. And did you... did you tell her about the girl with the rabbit? Or the other woman you stabbed, you know, like, to test the water? No, no, it didn't really seem right, you know, but in the cab, I mean, it's seem like she knew, you know, and she seem like she was okay with it. With you killing her? Yeah. MONA: I think she's okay with it. I see this playing out in one of three ways. Do you wanna know? Well, yeah, of course. That's why I called you. Okay. The first one is... ...she knows exactly what's going on but she's, like, batshit crazy and wants to die. She wants to die, you know, so she won't say anything to the doctor. Just wait for her and when she walks out of the hospital, take her home and stab her, right? It makes sense, right? Yeah, all right, okay. And what was the second? What's the second? Okay. The second one is, it's the same but different. It's like, yeah, she knows exactly what's going on but she was just playing along with it to buy some time, you know, like she was being fake, so in that case... ...she's telling the doctor right now everything, you're kind of fucked up, baby. Oh, God. I don't like that one. MONA: I know. That... that's... well... that's the worst. Hey, baby, you sound cold. Do you have a scarf on you? - Yes. - Don't lie to me. REED: Baby, please, come on. What's the third? MONA: I don't want you to get sick. I'm totally fine, please? - If you're sick... - Uh-huh. ...the baby's gonna be sick. Yeah, baby, please, come on. Focus. What's the third? MONA: You promise me. REED: I promise, I promise, I promise, I promise. Okay, sorry. Um, the third one is good. The third one is... ...she didn't see a shit. She doesn't know what's going on, so you should just stick to the plan, right? Yeah. Yeah, I guess two out of three is pretty good. Um, yeah. I mean... odds say you should probably just kill her no matter what. Yeah. [TELEPHONE RINGING] I was afraid you won't really wait for me but you did. When I saw you, I almost fainted. It was like being in a movie, like being the lead actress in some big romantic scene. Look at your face, the most adorable thing I've ever seen. I just want to hit you. Not just like a little slap on the cheek, I want to punch you with my fist as hard as I can. Can you stay with me forever? No matter what? [SIGHS] I wanna watch you sleep. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS] JACKIE: Come on. Here, try these on. They're more for the summer really but they're nice, aren't they? They're from Morocco. I've got lots of other kinds too. See these? Antique Chinese. Isn't these so beautiful? Of course they were for bound feet so you can't really wear them. Um, those ones can be a little scratchy if you're not wearing socks but with socks, they're really comfortable, don't you think? Do you want an espresso or would you rather have like a beer or gin and tonic or something like that? Espresso's good. Okay. [CLATTERS] JACKIE: I just got this new machine. It's, um... it's a professional model. It's from Germany. [HUMMING] Your apartment is very nice. Did you decorate it yourself? JACKIE: Uh-hmm. I don't really spend much money on anything else. A lot of girls like to go out drinking and clubbing and stuff like that but I don't. I don't really spend much money on clothes either. I like to build my wardrobe little by little, you know what I mean? Just buying the pieces that I really like. - Thank you. - JACKIE: Is that okay if I put on some music? - REED: Yeah. - Okay. Do you mind if I take off my makeup? [CLASSICAL MUSIC PLAYS] JACKIE: Okay. [ACOUSTIC MUSIC PLAYS] [HUMMING] How did it go at the hospital? Oh, of course. I forgot we have to put something on your hand. I have some, um, antiseptic. Do you want me to put it on for you? You need food. I make really good soup. I mean, it's just instant, but instant can be really good. The trick is knowing what to add like tonight I'm thinking I'll add a packet of cream consomme and some curry powder and some milk. Regular milk and condensed milk because it complements the sweetness of the corn. And it's more nutritious that way. Curry powder on the other hand, that is a little bit different. Just a tiniest bit of curry powder accentuates the sweetness of the milk. Bet you didn't know that. So tell me the truth. What? The reason you sent for me. I know it wasn't really for S&M. Are you embarrassed? [SIGHS] No. What did you tell them at the hospital? About what? What did you tell the doctor? About what? About me. That you took me for a ride on my bicycle and I fell off. What? Yeah, bikes. They've got all sorts of things like sticking out all over the place like a thing to hold your water bottle and gears and chains, and things like that. I mean, I'm not an exercise junkie or anything but I read about it in one of those outdoorsy magazines. So, like, a lot of people get cuts on their legs when they fall. [CHUCKLES] [SIGHS] I mean, I don't think if he believed me, but I guess he didn't care. What do you mean? He seem busy or maybe because of the other scars, I guess he couldn't be bothered. REED: Other scar? Yeah. Do you wanna touch them? Want me to do this to you? Don't you wanna do it to me? [ACOUSTIC MUSIC PLAYS] You don't have to be afraid. Does it bother you that the curtains are open? I want to keep them open. I want to look at all the beautiful buildings. All the lights. Feel that? You know what that is, right? Silk. I bought these sheets two weeks ago. It's nothing like this that you could get from Korea or Taiwan that you buy in department stores. Even cheap silk is warm to touch. This is different. Imagine me lying here and you looking down at me. And these sheets getting wet with all sorts of things. [LAUGHING] Just think about what that could be like. Think about it. [LAUGHS] First you touch the sheets like this. Then after that, you touch my skin. [SIGHS] I want you to wear my skin. It's okay to make a mess. [LAUGHS] Have you done anything like this before? Once... when I was a teenager. But... I've thought about it... ever since. And I finally decided to try it again tonight. Get it out of my system. Get it out of your system. [SIGHS] Where are you going? To get my kit. For what? For what I was gonna do at the hotel. So are you just gonna tie me up? Well, yeah. Sure. Are you gonna leave me after? No. Can we eat first? [CLATTERS] JACKIE: Shit. Did I put too much curry powder in it? I'm sorry. Was it too spicy? No. No, it was good.

What? That's funny. [GROANING] [LAUGHS] REED: Now, you just set this thing, but it's not gonna hurt. But there is a trick, is you have to believe it. Because if you think it's gonna hurt, even just a little bit... then it will. Oh. Ahh. Oh. Look at me. Look at me. You have to believe that it won't hurt, do you understand? Hey... do you understand? Yeah. All right. Okay. Now, I'm going to stab you with an ice pick, okay? [MUMBLING] I'm going to stab you. Ice pick. Hang on. I have to get my ice pick. [SCREAMING] REED: Stop. Stop. [SCREAMING] REED: No. It's almost over, okay? Don't move. Stop. Don't move. I said don't move. I thought this is what you wanted. I thought this is what you wanted. I thought you wanted this.

That means S&M. Of course, you need a change of clothes. There will definitely be a lot of blood. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS] REED: Then the ball gag. That one that will completely seal her mouth. She must be able to vocalize in at least a minimal way. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS] REED: The victim has to be a prostitute, but what type? And she has to speak English. The terror must be in English. One the ice pick makes its appearance though, she'll probably try to run. Maybe I should drug her. What if she fights back? What if she hurts me? Maybe that wouldn't be so bad. [DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYS] JACKIE: Morning. [CLATTERING] [COFFEE GRINDER WHIRRING] REED [GRUNTS]: [GROANS] REED: What are you doing? Hmm? What are you doing? I want a way to remember this.
