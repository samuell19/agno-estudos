(synthesized and medieval music) (birds sing) (shovel scraping and dirt thudding) (grunts) (birds caw) (man grunts) (shovel scraping) (grunts) - What are they doing? - Digging for bones. They're trying to rid the Church of a memory. One's that haunted them for over 40 years. - Who was he? - His name was Wycliffe. Doctor John Wycliffe. - You knew him, Father. - Oh, yes, my son. I knew him. - What did he do to deserve this? - I'll tell you about it. He was a man whose life should be remembered as long as this English nation of ours loves its freedom. I first met him when I was a student at Oxford. And he was the best teacher I ever had. The best preacher I ever heard. He quickened both heart and mind. He found us as boys (gentle medieval music) and led us to manhood. He's known throughout Europe as the most brilliant scholar and philosopher of this age. But we who watched him saw that it was his study of the Scriptures that really released his enormous energies. (trumpets blow fanfare) His Biblical research convinced him that our beloved Church had long since departed from the New Testament. (birds sing and chatter) The Doctor couldn't keep silent. He called for drastic changes. And that is when his troubles began to mount. - The Holy Father has been sent warning. John Wycliffe must be got into line (clatters) quickly and completely. - My Lord Archbishop, let me assure you that I am most zealous to perform the Holy Father's bidding. - We must not fail again this time, Bishop Courtenay. I have assured His Holiness that you have the matter under control. - The political tide has shifted to our favor, Your Grace. Wycliffe could have been silenced long ago, but for John of Gault's protection. But now we have the upper hand. Besides, (rustles) Wycliffe's own words in writing is all the case we need. I will see to it that His Holiness is pleased. - I am apprehensive. My brothers, we must not see only the threat. I have longed for this opportunity! At my trial at Saint Paul's a year ago, I did not get to say a single word in my own defense. My supporters and my opponents argued over protocol. And then the mob disrupted the trial. Nothing was settled because nothing was discussed! Now, at least, Bishop Courtenay has moved this trial to Lambeth, where, God-willing, we should be free of outside disturbance. - I still think the outside disturbance may have saved your life! - If the bishops will listen to reason, if they will answer me from Scripture, if we can agree that the glory of God's Church is to be found in devotion and faith and service, not in power and wealth, well Nicholas, just think of the many doors this trial could open. - I only hope it doesn't lock a door. The one to your cell. (scraping) (fire crackles) - Uncle, I wish you wouldn't go. - My dear niece. I'm sorry to leave you alone. - I'm worried! I fear I'll not see you again. I had a terrible dream last night. I dreamt you were alone on an island of rock in the middle of a vast sea-- - Now don't be afraid! Are we not in the Hands of the Lord? I expect He has much more for both of us to do. - The friars are saying that you are a heretic! That you'll be seized! - It's certainly like them to plague a good woman with false fears. The friars are angry with me because I say they have no right to act like parasites, acquiring riches by leeching off the poor, yet not requiring enough learning to read a simple Bible passage. Have no fear. I shall be back before long. - All the same, it will be dangerous! Promise me you'll be careful. (soft flute music) - Oh Lord, King of Heaven and Earth, my mind is spinning. It finds no rest! How often have I been tempted to submit and withdraw my writing. Yet, just as often, I have been led back to the Authority of Thy Holy Word! Facing this trial, I am a man walking the edge of a precipice at midnight. And yet, Father, I cannot deny the truth of Thy Scriptures! I thank The that Thou art altogether wise and gracious. Lord, give me the wisdom to defend Thy Word! Whatever trials there may be, lend me the Grace to endure them! (soft organ music) Into Thy Hands, oh Lord, I commend my spirit. Whether for life or death, for prison or freedom, according to Thy Holy Will. In the name of our Risen Lord, Jesus. (footsteps echo) (birds sing) - [John] Good morrow, Nicholas! - [Nicholas] Good morning, Doctor! - [John] Do you think we shall keep pace with these students? - That, my dear John, is a question I frequently ponder before entering my classes. - (laughs) Well said! I have received word that we are to stop on our journey to confer with John of Gaunt. - He's aided you greatly in the past, Doctor. - He has, indeed! He's been as devoted a patron to me as he has been to Geoffrey Chaucer. - You may need him more than ever now. - We shall soon see. But now we must make haste! (upbeat medieval music) - God save you, Doctor Wycliffe! Gentlemen! - [John] Good day to you, Sheriff. - Good day. (murmuring) - [John] Back to your duties? - That's right, sir! This fine fellow's a highwayman! Been robbing travelers around these parts for some time past! But it's the hangman's rope for him now, all right! - These young gentlemen your students, Doctor? - [John] Yes, sir. - Look well on this wretch, young sirs. And remember the fate of men who fall from the Grace of God! - You can save your insults, Sheriff. I am not fallen from God's Grace! My sins are as surely forgiven as the sins of any man in England! - Silence, you dog! (thuds) Shall this good doctor hear your blasphemy? - [John] Please, Sheriff! Please let him speak! I am interested to hear what he has to say. - God bless you, Father. I have been a soldier of the King and I do not deserve this ill treatment! - Then why have you taken to this dishonorable life of stealing? - Well, you know as well as I do, Father. You know the law. It's almost 25 years now since they fixed laborers' wages. Said they couldn't go up no more. (fly buzzing) But the cost of food goes up all the time! (chuckles) A man just can't afford to earn an honest living no more! - My son, I know you believe you have good cause to be bitter, but nothing can excuse the breaking of God's Laws. But what do you mean that you are assured the forgiveness of your sins? - Oh. Well, I went to my priest and I bought an indulgence! Paid good money for it, too! My priest promised me that I had the stored graces of the Holy Church for my forgiveness! (chuckles) I may be a thief, Father, but I've always been a good Christian! - Well, tell me this, good Christian, did Jesus sell indulgences like yours? - Well, my indulgence is good, I tell ya! - Man, the forgiveness of God is not to be purchased by a few coins! - Yeah, but I paid good money! My priest promised the indulgence was good! What are you saying? That it's worthless? - Believe me, my son. God's forgiveness and grace will give you true assurance. No indulgence can do that! I will ask the Sheriff to send for my Vicar at Lutterworth Church and he will hear your confession and help you find true repentance. (grumbles) It is never too late! A repentant thief who died next to Christ on the cross got the best assurance of all. "Today," Christ told him, "thou shalt be with Me in Paradise." That thief needed no indulgence. He needed only to turn to Christ. - Oh, yeah? I almost begin to believe you, Father. (rhythmic medieval music) (sheep bleating) (men murmuring) - I think you'll find water for the horse down there. (horse snorts) (sheep bleat) (soft music) - Good sirs! (birds sing) Uh, if you please, good sirs! They say in the village that one of you be a great doctor of the Church. If that be so, may a poor man ask for some help? - How can I help you, sir? - Oh, I do not ask for money, Doctor. Just a little of your time. - How can I be of service? - 'Tis my wife that needs the help, Doctor. She's beside herself with grief for the boy child we had last year that died. Well, I try to reason with her and comfort her, but my words avail as little as a cold wind. She will not be comforted. For myself, I try not to get too fond of a child till it gets to be six years of age or so. So many of the little ones die, you know. - Has your wife spoken to the parish priest? - That's the pity of it, Father. The babe was not baptized. - [John] Not baptized? - 'Twas my fault, Doctor! There was a special levy from the Church for the Pope's army and I had no money for a donation. - And the priest would not baptize without a donation? - No, Father. - Oh, generation of vipers! - And before I could earn the money, the poor babe was carried off by a fever! Many months have passed, but my poor wife spends every day in weeping. Will you help her, good sir? - May the Lord bless you and give you peace, my daughter. - I thank you for your kindness, good Doctor. (sighs) But my heart is so broken it will not be comforted. - You see, sir, what did I tell you? - God will bring peace to your mind and your heart if you will only give Him leave. His Love is especially lent to broken hearts like yours. (sniffles) (sniffles) Father, I will tell you why my heart aches sore. (sniffles) Some months ago, a travelling pardoner came through our village and this friar told me that (gasps) the spirits of unbaptized infants are cursed to wander as fireflies! (sobs) - He told you that? - (sniffles) Yes, Father! (sobs) And now, whenever I see the fireflies rise in the summer twilight, I fear that maybe the spirit of my own poor lost child is there! - Woman, you know that God has given us a Holy Book to lead us into all truth. - The Bible, Father. - Yes, my daughter. And I spent my life in study of these scriptures. Now I tell you, truly, that there is nothing in God's book of this old wives' tale of the fireflies! - No, Father? - No. No. Have you ever heard of the great King David? - Yes, Father, in the mystery plays at (inhales) festival time. - His story is told us in the Scriptures. And the Book revealed that one day the great King David had one of his own baby children grow sick and die. And when the child was dead, David rose up and said, "My child will not return to me, "but shall go, one day, to be with him." And that was many years before the institution of baptism. - Oh, Doctor, you speak so comfortingly. But how shall I know that one day I shall go to be with my child? - Keep your eyes fixed on that other babe, born so many years ago in Bethlehem, Whose death did break the heart of His own dear mother, the Holy Virgin. Keep in your heart that Christ died to purchase our souls by His hard suffering on the bitter cross. And remember that He rose again at Easter to call us to Himself in Glory. (soft flute music) (sobs and sniffles) (lively medieval music) - I'm amazed, Doctor, at the comfort you give these troubled souls you meet. Their countenance changes in your very presence. - A but notice, Mister Purvey, it is the sharing of the Scriptures that gives the comfort, is it not? (sighs) Well, we are less than one hour from John of Gaunt's. We shall soon see what words of comfort he has in store for us. (solemn music) - Don't look to me this time, John Wycliffe. I cannot save you again! I came to your rescue at Saint Paul's, but at Lambeth you will be alone. - My Lord, I can-- - I cannot intervene again! I would do you more harm than good now! It is only a few short months since the death of my beloved father, King Edward. Now we have a 10-year-old boy on the throne! Our dear Richard is no more than a puppet in the hands of ambitious men. Men who are afraid, lest I should usurp their new-found power! Now is not the time to have John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, at your side. However, though I shall not be present to pluck you out of trouble again, I would give you a little instruction how to deport yourself at Lambeth. (scoffs) For God's sake, Wycliffe, you are sometimes so naive! This time, you must try and grasp the politics of the situation! - My Lord, your advice is always welcome, but politics is your Lordship's study, not my own. - So you have always said! Ah, I remember when my father sent you as a delegate to the peace conference in Bruges. You arguments were good and sound, but your approach so stiff and unbending. Even now, you still do not comprehend the thrust and parry of politics! (weapons crash and thud) It's like fighting! Squire Newberry, defend yourself! (weapons clash) Politics is conflict, my dear Wycliffe. Like a duel or battle. (grunts and weapons clash) Fight a political enemy (weapons clash) as you would a military enemy. With tactics. (grunting and weapons clashing) Strategy. Know when to attack. (weapons clash) Where to defend. (shouting and weapons clashing) And when to bid an honorable retreat! (shouting) (grunts and clatters) - I cry mercy, sir! - In battle, that would have cost you your life, squire. And me a good man. (squire sighs and shield scraping) Be off with you! Wycliffe, have you been listening, man? - I hear you, my Lord, but I cannot see how this applies to my case. - Then let us be a little more specific. At Lambeth Palace, your most dangerous enemy will not be Sudbury, but Bishop Courtenay. He seeks your downfall. He makes no secret of it! Do not let your quick tongue fill his quiver with arrows for your own destruction. Be diplomatic. Be moderate. Fight a tactical battle. Attack when you can, retreat when you must. - My Lord knows that I will speak truly and remain steadfast in my opinions. - That is exactly what I expected you to say! You and your Saxon stubbornness! - My Lord would prefer me to exercise Norman duplicity? (chuckles) - Oh, if this were still an age of champions. I recall the glorious challenge my late brother, the Black Prince, threw down to the King of France. That they should decide the issue of a whole war in single combat. Think of it. What both our nations would have been spared. - Yes, I know. - John, in ecclesiastical matters, you are my champion and the champion of England. You have helped restore to the Crown its dignity and prerogative as derived from God. Maybe now, at last, we shall see an end to the dominion of popes and prelates. This English nation will be a mighty one when it finds the will to rouse itself. Saxon or Norman, we stand or fall as Englishmen. - But the point I make in my writing is that lordship comes from God and can only be exercised as by a steward, in His service. I confess I'm sometimes appalled by the interpretations that political men put upon my words. Yet I have written nothing but what I have learned in God's Law. Make no mistake, I take my stand on the Scriptures. - (sighs) As you will argue, no doubt, at Lambert in your customary contentious manner! - Circumstances will govern my actions, but not as the young squire's thrusts governed yours, a few moments ago. (laughs) - Wycliffe, you are exasperating! And I love you for it. Stick to your Scriptures, then, and be a David to bring down the Goliath Courtenay. And may you conquer, for he is a tool of Rome and his ambition would enslave us all! - Fear not, great Duke! I place myself in the Mighty Hands of God! (chuckles) - Well and good, Doctor. But at Lambeth, you might fight that He delivers you by the hands of a woman. - My Lord? (ominous music) - [Archbishop] Doctor Wycliffe, you have heard the charges against you. You have heard the accusers. You are satisfied that your teachings have been accurately presented to this court? - I deny only that they are unorthodox. - We would have you questioned by Bishop Courtenay, who has studied minutely the merits of your theses. Bishop Courtenay. - Thank you, my Lord Archbishop. - Doctor Wycliffe. We rejoice that you have condescended to obey our summons. - And I rejoice that you have studied minutely my theses, Bishop Courtenay. You profess, Doctor, that the authority of human government can be higher than that of God's Church! - I have taught that all dominion comes equally from God. Again, if it be rightfully exercised in obedience to God. Should the Church, corruptly or evilly, misuse its powers, then the civil authorities would have the right and the duty to correct that abuse. - And who will be judge of this? That same civil authority? Indeed, Doctor Wycliffe, is not this famous theory of dominion a mere justification for the crown to usurp the property and prerogative of the Church? - No, my Lord, it is not! (crowd murmurs) But in the matter of property, seeing that you refer to it, I see no basis in the Word of God for the Church to possess extreme material wealth! - Ah! Can it be that Doctor Wycliffe is jealous that he has not received the share that his great talents deserve? (men murmur) - One third of the land of England is owned by the Church, my Lord Bishop! Such ownership is not the business of the Church! Christ and his apostles lived in poverty. Might we not do well to imitate their example? (men murmuring) - And how do you suggest we disposed of the Church's goods? By presenting them, perhaps, to the English nobility? I'm sure the Duke of Lancaster and his party could put them to good use! - No, my Lord Bishop! But I do have a suggestion. Rather than pay fat stipends to the large number of foreign churchmen who the Pope has appointed to absentee English benefices, the Church might better use its wealth to feed the poor and starving common people of this realm! (men murmur) Let us begin there! - Your own mouth condemns you, Wycliffe. First you seek to undermine the authority of the Church, of the bishops and even of the Pope. And now you instruct us how best to bring about our own downfall! You leave little room for doubt what the verdict of this court must be! (men murmur) One last question, Doctor Wycliffe. What spiritual authority would replace the one that you have just so effectively demolished? Your own fevered brain? - No, Bishop Courtenay. The only true authority. The Word of God! (men chatter) The Holy Scriptures! - Let me pass! Let me pass! I have an important document for the Archbishop! (paper rustles) - Brothers in Christ, this is a letter from our Queen Mother, Joan of Kent. Speaking on behalf of her son, Richard, who at his majority will ascend the throne of this realm, Her Majesty declares that Doctor John Wycliffe has rendered long and valued service to the Crown. The which she asks this court to recognize. Further, she requests that there be no harassment of Doctor Wycliffe. And, lastly, she requests that this court shall refrain from pronouncing any final judgement. (men murmuring) - She has no right! - No right, Bishop Courtenay? No right? The Queen Mother has spoken and we shall listen respectfully. (men murmur) Dear brothers, let us proceed. We will confine ourselves to the consideration of the points at issue in Doctor Wycliffe's theses, and refrain from any judgement of the man himself. (men chatter) - John of Gaunt. (sighs) I perceive his foul hand in this. Queen Mother would not have written so without his prodding. So, (smacks kiss) once again, Wycliffe escapes our grasp. - You would have delighted in his destruction, my Lord. - Delighted? For God, I should hope not. You think I relish this conflict? I would rather have Wycliffe with us than against us. He's a brilliant man. His life spotless. His devotion to God beyond question. Dangerously attractive qualities. But the man is misled. He is a heretic and he must be silenced! If he is not checked, his voice could poison all of Christendom. - It is said his following grows daily. His name and influence spread like the plague. You've heard, my Lord, of the many itinerant priests he has sent into the countryside to preach the Scriptures. - Considering what a mockery so much of the preaching of our friars and pardoners has become of late, I can hardly condemn him for that. (sighs) Sometimes I wonder, is mine the only voice to be raised in defense of the true Church? (kiss smacks and sighs) What is to be done when the head is such a weak tool? Sudbury blows hot and cold at the breathing of the wind. He's a coward! - Archbishops do not live forever, my Lord. (sighs) - Very true, Brother Mark. But if we wait to fill dead men's shoes, we may wait too long! - You have some action in mind? - Oh, yes. Yes, indeed. The bird may have flown beyond our grasp, but the nest is still there for the taking. Oxford is the key. If Oxford is purged of Wycliffe and his lalard heresies, they will lose their credibility. Without the endorsement of the academic world, the nobility will find them less attractive. Ideas are only as powerful as the men that hold them. Besides, if the peasants get any more troublesome than they are already, the nobility will be the first to cry for law and order. (smacks kiss) And where will they turn for help? To the Church. (organ music) - [Father] But Wycliffe (soft music) was allowed to remain at Oxford. Pope Gregory died and chaos ensued. The Church broke apart with the election of two rival popes. England and most of Europe went with Pope Urban the Sixth in Rome. France and a few allies supported Pope Clement the Seventh in Avignon. In the confusion that followed, John Wycliffe was left free to continue his writing. His ideas grew more and more bold. - This is most strange. I don't understand. - Beth! Ah, there you are, daughter! What a hunt we had today! You should have seen it! Mm! Two boars dead within the first hour! The second nearly got poor Newbury! But why such a grim face? - We were discussing this new book, fresh from the copiers, Father. It arrived the day before yesterday. (laughing) - Well, if a book will take away my daughter's pretty smile, I regret that I ever allowed her to be taught her letters! Oh, it must be very serious, indeed. - Well, Father, it is by your old chaplain, John Wycliffe. - (sighs) What has the man done now? - Why, Father, haven't you heard? This book is book is Wycliffe's attack on the Church doctrine. On transubstantiation. - Against the mass. This time this priest has gone too far! Squire Holden! Get the horses ready! We ride for Oxford! (dramatic music) (soft music) - [Father] My Lord, he cannot be disturbed! (doors slamming) - You have gone too far, John Wycliffe! This time, you have gone too far! - Noble Duke? - I have just seen what you have written on the Holy Eucharist! You have dared to attack the doctrine of transubstantiation? The very central doctrine of the Church! - Yes, my Lord, I have. - Is that all you have to say, you wretched pet? You stand there in your bearded insolence and simply say, "Yes, my Lord"? No. An attack on transubstantiation is an attack on the mass. An attack on the mass is an attack on the foundation of the Holy Church! Retract, retract it at once! - My Lord, the Holy Scriptures tell us that Jesus Christ is the foundation of the Church. - Don't quibble, Doctor! You are attacking Jesus's sacrifice! - I think not, my Lord. Transubstantiation is a modern doctrine unknown to the fathers of the Church. Pope Edison the Third, at the fourth Lateran Council first proclaimed it. Less than 200 years ago! - I care not when it was proclaimed! It is believed! Believed throughout the whole of Christendom! - My noble Duke! The fact that something is believed by the multitudes does not necessarily make it true! - Wycliffe! (sighs) (sighs) John. You will know why I ask this thing of you. - Yes, my Leige, I think that I do. - We have known each other for many years. - A great many years. - You gave loyal service to the old King! - God rest his soul. I wish he was alive today. - John, you know well the hold you now have upon the hearts of the people of this nation. If you do not recant this folly, a wound may open which might never heal. Already there is rebellion in the air. (sighs) My nephew Richard is surrounded by fools and flatterers! My Lords of Gloucester and Arundel pull the strings upon which he dances! And they are dangerous men! (sighs) I am fearful of what chaos may be let lose in England. - You do well to be fearful, my Lord. The poor of this realm have suffered too much too long. - And you would do well to be fearful if you persist in this new teaching! (sighs) I can do no more. Your stubbornness puts you at Courtenay's mercy. - I can only continue the work I've begun. Man may attack the body, but not the soul! You would not have me buy the protection of Courtenay by selling my soul! - May God bless your courage, John. - My Lord, it has been my privilege to serve you all these years. I thank you for all you have done to shield me. If you have to step back from me now, have no fear. The Lord will be my Shield. - I might not see your face again. - God keep us, then, till we meet in His Kingdom. - Farewell, John. - Farewell, great Duke. (hug slamming) (door clatters) (lone flute music) - This is madness, John, you know it is! Their leader John Ball has escaped from prison! That could only mean trouble! We have no business being here! - How many times have I appealed on behalf of the poor of this country, Nicholas? I'm identified with their cause! Why should I not speak to these peasants when they ask to meet me? - They're on the bring of insurrection. If it is believed that you helped to fan the flames-- - Well, let us at least ask what they have to say! (sighs) - Ah, Doctor Wycliffe! You have come! - [John] Yes, as you asked. But why this secrecy? - For all our sakes, Doctor. We take a certain risk in talking to you. We know that you be in some considerable danger. Your poor preachers come into our villages and tell the Bible stories. - They be our friends. We think you're our friend, too. We think you're on our side. - I think, my friend, I've already declared myself on your side. - Well, answer me this, then. Who is right? The poor laborers who can't fill their children's bellies no matter how hard they work, or the governers, that ain't given them a raise in nigh on 30 years! - Take care, John, this is a powder keg! - You are fully justified in what you say. It's time things were changed! - Aye, it's time for a change! It's time to overthrow the tyrants! Doctor, we are many thousand strong. Every man amongst us knows and honors your name. If you would help us-- - The purpose of my life is to help all God's people. But tell me, is it true that John Ball has escaped from prison? - You know about that? As a matter of fact, yes, it is so, sir. - Then it is he who has stirred up this revolt? - Oh, he may have stirred it up, but the pot has been brewing for a long time, now! He knows what to do! - Brothers, listen! Our Lord Jesus lived in an age of cruelty and injustice far worse than our own. He came to overthrow tyranny. But not with the methods of tyranny! His Kingdom will prevail, but we must work for it in His way, following His Word! - Words, words! The time for words is past! Now is the time for weapons to speak! - Consider, I beg you! - Consider, I beg you. We've had enough of your fine gentleman's words! What made us think that this fine Oxford gentleman would dirty his hands in our cause? He doesn't care! - That is neither just nor true! - I don't care? You say I don't care? How many times have I spoken for your cause? Pleaded on your behalf for mercy that your wrongs might be righted? I've appealed to the Church, begged them to look to the needs of the poor! And now my Church censures me. I am spurned from my efforts by the civil authorities. The royal court distrusts me! And you say I do not care? You must understand, the way of arms, if not Christ's way, cannot be my way. Nor should it be the way of any Christian man! - You are a good man, sir. And we are not evil men, neither. Your priests have shown us the way of Christ and we wanna follow it. But it won't put wool on our backs nor bread in our mouths! Religious talk can't stop us now! There's been too much talk with too little results! - My brothers, wait! Our Lord was not the landed gentry. He was common man, a carpenter, who left His trade to become a servant to others! He washed His disciples' feet! If you let Him, God will wash the rancor from your hearts. And lead you in His way! We will see things change. Believe me, we will! - You've got to understand, sir. It's gone on for too long. Far too long. Now we fight! (dramatic music) (drumming) (thudding and men shouting) (fire roars) - [Father] Chaos and bloodshed came to England with the outbreak of the peasants' revolt. Thousands of the poor marched on London, smashing every authority except that of the young King Richard the Second. The knighthood, once gathered in force, put down the rebellion, but it was a time of disorder and violent protest against all the institutions that oppressed the common people. (birds caw) The nobility and many in the Church began to hold John Wycliffe to blame for the revolt. It was charged that his doctrines made the peasants think that they were important in the Eyes of God, and thus they might have earthly rights, too. Simon Sudbury, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was beheaded by the mob, and in the aftermath, Pope Urban appointed Thomas Courtenay as the new Archbishop of Canterbury. With the supreme ecclesiastical power in England in his hands at last, (fire crackles) Archbishop Courtenay wasted no time in moving against Wycliffe. (paper rustles) - To Chancellor Rigg at Oxford, without delay. So, John Wycliffe, let's see who's master now. (dramatic music) (birds singing) - It had to succumb, John. Since my appointment, I fought for your liberty to teach what you would within these walls. Doctrines condemned by the papal court, teaching forbidden by the Lambeth Council. But, it couldn't last. We both knew that. Courtenay has appointed a council of 12 to oversee the university. My authority is by license of that council. They have issued their first ordinance. See for yourself! - I am to be deprived of all academic privileges? - I do not wish to submit, God knows. - You have no choice, Chancellor. While the university remains an arm of the Church, you have no choice. If you resist-- - If I resist, Pope Urban will place an end to the university. The university will lose all its hard-won privileges! - My problem's mine. - Precisely. Though I feel that would be the end of the matter, other heads will roll. I'm sure of that. Probably mine, too. They have no regard for this place as the greatest center of learning in the Christian world. They care only for conformity and proper obedience! - So I am to be forbidden to teach! And am I also to be denied access to the libraries for my studies? - That is undoubtedly what the Council has in for you. (inhales) John, its intention is simply to cut you off from everything you stood for. - How can I continue my work? - As my old friend, I'm, I don't know. (mournful vocal and flute music) - [Man] Good day to you, Doctor! Bactar, I did not see you there! And Stivcova! - That is right, sir. I'm sorry we disturbed your meditation. - No disturbance. I have time for my students always. You two are near the end of your studies, are you not? You'll be returning to your homeland before long. - Yes, sir! And we have something to tell you! Whilst we've been at Oxford, we have copied all your work. Every one of them. - Every one? - Every one. The complete works of Doctor John Wycliffe. We copy everything. - Your books go with us back to Bohemia. - (sighs) What should I say? I'm astonished! And delighted. - Sir, Bohemia is such a beautiful country. In Prague your name is already famous! Won't you come with us? Things are so sad for you here now. We hear you have nothing to teach. There's danger for you here. - In Prague, you would be honored, as you deserve. - A moment ago, I was in deep despair. Now, I'm full of joy. I thank God for two such good friends. (sighs) But your invitation turns to me, I am an academic. I've always lived amongst academics, and I confess I'm frightened by the condemnation that's heaped upon my head. - Please come with us. You'll find the protection you need to continue your work. (sighs) - No, I think not. Somehow I feel it's not yet finished. I think there's still work for me to do here in England. - We promise, Doctor. Whatever happens here in England, you, your teaching will live on in the fortress mountains of Bohemia. - How marvelous are God's ways. May He ever continue to do His work through you, my dear sons in Christ. You see, in a way, I do go with you to your homeland. (chuckles) (soft flute music) Yes! Yes I see! I give you thanks, Lord! Yes, oh yes! Now I understand! Lutterworth. Oh, Lord, it shall be! Thy will be done! - Lutterworth? What will you do at Lutterworth? - Have I not, have I not these eight years past been rector there? Why should I not resume my pastoral duties? Perhaps, it's about time, considering a number of sermons I've preached against absentee clerics. - Oh, you know full well you've never neglected your pastoral duties! Neither here nor Oxford! - Last night in my prayers, I suddenly saw quite clearly. The Divine Hand of Providence was guiding me back to Lutterworth. - As pastor? - Yes, and what I must do there will the most challenging that I shall ever face in my life as a scholar. - As a scholar, sir? What do you mean? - My entire career has clearly led me to see that our entire authority is only to be found in traditions with councils. In the Church we have a Pope. Higher authority is the Word of God alone! Over the centuries, that authority has been eroded, usurped, and now our nation, our own people, our civilization, starves for lack of the World of God! How do men live under the authority of God's Word if they do not know God's Word? The clergy immersed in it do not even know their Latin! (laughs) It is still a lesson in God's Word. My task now, our task, if you will, Nicholas, John, if you will, is to use this exile to translate the Holy Scriptures, all of them, into English! Our native English tongue so they can be heard and understood by all our people! Well? - It will be a glorious undertaking, Doctor. - Most of your students will want to help. There will be no lack of workers. - You know the shock waves this will send through the Curia. Not to mention your opponents at Canterbury. You already stand accused of heresy. Translating the Bible will be seen by some as nothing less than insurrection against our Mother Church! - Yet I see it as nothing less than my sacred duty! As a loyal son of Christ's Church. It's so plain to me now! How did we ever lose it? The New Testament was written in the Koine Greek, the language of the people! So Jerome's Latin Vulgate translation was in the common tongue! Are Englishmen to be deprived of the Word of God, because it's locked up in a foreign language? How can we keep a faithful Church without the Word of God that is bread for hungry souls? My dream is to see the unquenchable fire of God's Word kindled in the hearts and minds of all our people! All our people. (thoughtful chanting and organ music) (birds singing) - Good day, Lord Wycliffe. (keys jingling) - Good day to you, Forest. Forest? - Yes, Doctor? - I don't think I shall be needing this any further. - No, Doctor. Thank you. God be with you, Doctor Wycliffe. - And with you, Forest. (gentle music) (urgent music) - [Father] For months, we labored at our great task, day after day, close attention to the Holy Scriptures became for us a source of revelation and constantly new insight into the Truth of God's Law. Our hearts were set aflame with the Word of God. The research, translation and coping of that Word became not a task, but a supreme act of worship. Throughout this time, Doctor Wycliffe was sustained by an amazing energy. While still performing his parish duties and continuing to write and speak in public against the corruption within the Church, which so deeply distressed him, he nevertheless managed to supervise personally details of the translation work. But he soon began to realize that the translation of the Word into English was only the first step. Now, the word had to be taken to the people. (solemn organ music) In the second year at Lutterworth, Wycliffe suffered a stroke which left him partly crippled. But he would not permit his affliction to disrupt his work. (footsteps echo) - Brothers in Christ! I rejoice to greet you at this blessed time. And I thank God that He has spared me to see this day. You know, all of you, that I first began to send out my little flock of poor priests during my years at Oxford. They were a gallant band. But after my banishment, I never thought to preside over such a commissioning again. Yet here you are! My brave new flock! I bless you! And, oh, how much I thank God for you! - Within this ville, we have uncovered the damnable heresies of this pernicious school man, John Wycliffe! When shall we be spared the venom of his pen? The subversive threat of his presence? See for yourselves how low he has sunk. This man, of former great reputation, the jewel of Oxford, famed throughout Europe for his knowledge of the Scriptures and, Fathers, look now at his depraved teachings! He attacks the very foundation of the Church! Declares it lawful for any man to preach the Word of God. Refutes the necessity of the authorization of the apostolic see. This Wycliffe would have the people here preaching from any common man who could open a copy of the Scriptures! - Every man is called to be a steward of God. Every man is responsible to God for what he does with his life. Every man must stand alone before the final judgement of God. God has given us these Scriptures that we should learn how to think and believe and live. Oh, my good brethren, let us make it known that it is every man's right to examine the Scriptures for himself, to read them in his own tongue, that he may learn how to serve God. It is not enough to leave their interpretation to the Church. - He has been condemned for a heretic. Forbidden to canvas his pernicious doctrines and pulpit gospel. Oxford has been cleansed of his influence so that it is no longer a center of heresy. And yet, this learned doctor still remains a thorn in the flesh of the Mother Church! For now what do we learn? That he and his acolytes have been engaged, from the moment he went to Lutterworth, in translating the Holy Scriptures into the common English tongue! Shall God's Law, which has come down to us in the language of learning, be so abased? So stripped of majesty? So enfeebled of meaning? How shall the vulgar tongue of common men adequately convey its wisdom? - Do we really dare to give the Word of God in the common tongue into the hands of the common people? Do we fully understand what we are doing? Will some not abuse, misuse and misinterpret the Scriptures? My brethren, of course some will. But has keeping the Scriptures as the property of the hierarchy in the clergy prevented misuse? No, indeed. It has furthered its abuse. We will give God's Word to God's children and His Spirit will guide them. It will take time for growth and understanding. But I fear what judgement may befall us if we dare not give out this Word! - Did not the blessed Saint Augustine declare that it was necessary only for God's ordained to understand the Holy Scriptures? That they alone should communicate this knowledge? God has committed the treasure of His Word to the keeping of His Holy Church, that ignorant men should not misinterpret them into their own damnation. - It is reported, your Grace, that Wycliffe's intention is to release another band of ragged preachers upon the countryside, this time armed with copies of the new translation. - Then they must be stopped! It shall be ordered that under King Richard's seal and upon certification from the Bishop, that henceforth all itinerant priests shall be arrested and imprisoned. - My friends, the way will be hard. Hunger, bitter cold, foul words, physical attack await you. It may be you will be persecuted, imprisoned. Then, like Christ, you will turn the other cheek. If need be, again and again. Love Him and serve Him always. Therein lies your strength. - Furthermore, it is the mandate of this senate that a condemnation of John Wycliffe be set forth with all speed. He shall, at last, be delivered into our hands for the judgement and condemnation he deserves. - [Father] Wycliffe never appeared at the third trial. He suffered another stroke whilst attending Mass, which left him paralyzed. (men murmur) (flute music) The trial went on in his absence anyway, but was interrupted by a rare and violent earthquake. Both Courtenay's followers and Wycliffe's saw in it the hand of God's Judgement on the other. (soft choral and organ music) - Master Purvey, I am glad you are with me now. - My teacher. - My son, our work must go on. - It must and it will. - The time must come when, by God's Grace, every man and every woman in this kingdom must have the Word of God in the English language in their heart. (mournful music) (flames crackle) (birds sing) (bones clattering) (bones clatter) - After his death, his work and influence continued to spread, not only here in England, but in Europe too with Jan Hus of Prague. So there persecution followed. Many of us were put on trial, ordered to recant. Shamefully, some of us did. But some of us later renounced our recantations. - But why do they dig up his grave? Why do they burn his bones? - My lad. 13 years ago, 30 years after Doctor Wycliffe's death, the Council of Constance ordered that Jan Hus be burned at the stake and that the bones of John Wycliffe be dug up and burned to ashes. - Why? - Well, somehow, they think by burning his bones, that they can erase his memory and destroy his influence. But they never will. (water burbles) (soft music) The chronicler Fuller wrote, "They burnt his bones to ashes "and cast them into Swift, "a neighboring brook running hard by. "Thus this brook hath conveyed his ashes "into Avon, "Avon into Savon, "Savon into the narrow seas, "they into the main ocean. "And thus the ashes of Wycliffe "are the emblem of his doctrine, "which now is dispersed the world over." (pensive medieval music)
