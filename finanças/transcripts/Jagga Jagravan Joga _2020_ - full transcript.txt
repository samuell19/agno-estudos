Davinder, come and have some tea. Take these two dresses with shawls. I have worn them only twice. Thank you, ma'am. I am only surviving because I have your support. Otherwise, I don't know where I had to wander to survive. Any news about your husband? No, ma'am. No news yet. That incident is like a nightmare to me. What happened, Davinder? I don't know. I feel like vomiting. Are you feeling alright? I'll go and get the medicine from the station doctor. No need for any medicine. Get some raw mangoes on your way back from the field. I feel like have something sour. Raw mangoes, huh? You have made me so happy, Davinder Kaur! "Your beloved has bought a new truck." Someone's in a happy mood. Who's the singer? Someone like Shinda? You are going to be a grandfather. I'll go to Ferozpur and get sweets for everyone. We have come here to discuss something else. You harvested crops on the field as you liked... ...while my brother and his wife was alive. We never asked you for a share or a rent. But it is difficult to continue with that. If you heed our advice then we shall continue to be amicable. Our sister will still have a place she can call her parental home. You know it's not right for a husband to stay in his wife's parental home for long. Father, did you see the consequences of nurturing a snake? I had told you we should have killed uncle's daughter when she was a child. If she gives birth to a son then he will challenge our children. Englishmen have left our country, but not before teaching us a trick or two. Oh my God. What is wrong? Did something happen? What do I say? I didn't get any share in the land back in the village. Davinder's uncle wants me to let go of this land as well. I cannot interfere in your family matters. But yes, I can offer you a job. You can later take an acre of land on rent. 'Where did he go this early in the morning without informing me?' Hello, brother. Hello is fine. But the brother part doesn't sound right. He is not at home. And he hasn't told me when will he return. That's why I am here. He is not here. And it is not easy for him to come back from where he has gone. What do you mean? I mean... Get him! Don't let him escape. Where do you think you are going? - What is wrong? - We will let you know. You are carrying a kilo of heroin with you... ...and you are asking me what is wrong? I didn't know that it is heroin. Muktaria asked me to get it. We have been asked to arrest you by our officer. He is my friend. You are lying. He will rot in prison for the rest of his life. Someone will have to take care of you as well. Seems like I will have to take up that responsibility. Imagine what he will do to you when he learns about this. He will only learn about it if he gets to come here. Now no one can stop me from making you mine. You cannot escape us! Get him! - Come on! - Let me go! Don't feel shy. You cannot escape us! Get him! Don't let him escape! Let me go! Leave me! Someone who can betray like this cannot be my friend. You filthy dog! Seems like the inspector is dead. Let's go. Take him along. Get him. He thinks he's some dangerous goon. You will get hanged now. You have killed an inspector. Get him! You cannot escape us! Hurry up, brother. The train is about to come. I treated you two like my brothers. You are behaving like my enemies. This is how you are repaying me for being a sister? Sister, your parents are alone up there. They must be missing you. Goodbye, sister. May God be with you. - Please forgive me. - Let's go. Oh, my God. Who tied this girl here? Who tied you here? Who did this? I will tell you everything. Let's leave before those devils come back. Hurry up. Get up. Come on, hurry up. Come on, let's go quickly. Who were they? Who tied you down? Aunt! Dear, how many times do I need to tell you not to carry heavy things? Look at your condition. Aunt, I wonder what great I did in the past to deserve this. You are working for others to feed me. I have no family. I took you in for my own selfish reasons. So that there is someone who will cry after I die. What are you saying, aunt? No, dear. You should be happy. We are soon going to be blessed with a child. Why is my darling son crying? Who has hit my handsome boy? We will beat that person up. Oh blessed one, I am all yours now. And you are all mine. It's a boy, girl. Why are you still sad? "Don't celebrate when you have a son." "When it's a boy." "Don't celebrate when you have a son." "You will always be crying." "It is not easy to deal with sons." "It is not easy." "It is not easy." "It is not easy." Auntie, Jogga is my classmate. Really? May God bless you both with success. Bye, ma'am. I'll get going now. It's time for Jogga's school. I need to make lunch. Hurry up. First give me two. Jagga is staring at us, man. You want one? Have it. Come on, have it. Pay up, kids. We don't have any money at the moment. You can take it tomorrow morning. Tomorrow morning, right! How will you pay him tomorrow? Why don't you pay him if you are that rich? Kids, did you see someone running away? I did. But you will need to pay to get the information. I'll need to pay? He entered that house. Give it to me. What is your name? Battery. Everyone calls me Battery. Where do you stay? I don't have any parents. So, how can I have a home? What work do you do? I serve tea at the tea shall. I also serve lunch at the restaurant. I also wash utensils if asked. If you have any work then I can do it for you. But you should let me play with you in the evenings. Come, sit down. Gabby and I have already purchased movie tickets. You two don't want to watch the movie? Mother, have you made tea? I'll make it right away. I need money to watch a movie. Son, I barely manage to pay the school fees and run the house. You should be considerate. I don't care. The whole school is going to watch the movie. You start making excuses whenever I ask for money. Son, only the rich go to theatre to watch a movie. Their father earn, and your father... And where is my father? Is he dead or alive? 'Oh, my God.' 'Who do I share my sorrows with?' 'I just had aunt and she is no more.' I will talk to the restaurant owner and asked him to give me money... ...instead of food for the next few days. Don't stop eating just to watch a movie. You can take my ticket, Jogga. I don't feel like watching the movie anyway. And where will get the other two tickets from? Jogga, should we go to the policeman we met yesterday? Friendly policemen, disloyal women, bad cars... ...and damaged weapons will always betray you. Let's go. - Where did they go? - I don't know. We will have fresh samosas and hot tea during the interval. Jagga, we had decided. That side of the tracks is yours and this side is mine. I took the goods from my area. Forget the area. Jagga likes to snatch things away. Hit him! Don't let him escape. Where are you running off to? You are stealing things? I'll take you to the police station. Who are you staring at? That little dog has killed me hard! You are hiding over here? Why did you have to mess with a cop? Cops have gone to your homes looking for you. Who told them where we stay? I think Jagga is behind this. He is the one who came to snatch the money. Go and call Gabby. We will run away. Gabby and I didn't hurt him. Why should we run with you? Pay up. We don't have any. Do you think this belongs to your father? Don't talk about my father. Tell me, if I can do any work for you. Why are you fighting with the kids? Take the money. Let's go, boys. Go and rest, boys. How are you doing, boys? Did you sleep well? I hope you didn't face any problem. No, uncle. Don't address me as uncle. Else, we won't get along. It's Baiji. Okay, Baiji. Get the tea. Give us the goods. Give us the money. The goods, first. The money, first. You want money? Snatch the goods from him. Catch those scoundrels. Don't let them escape. Well done, boys. This was a test. You have cleared it. They were my men. Keep this with you. That is your reward. Your pocket money. Oh no. There it goes. Listen to me. Come on Battery, that was a bad joke. Tell us if you have a better one. Battery, you lie a lot. There comes the call. Hello? Okay, Baiji. Let's go then, brother. "When they grew up..." "They went wild, my dear." "When they grew up..." "They went wild, my dear." "My dear, the boys without parents went out of control." "Parents..." Give the money from one hand and take the goods from the other. We have given you top quality stuff. I hope all the money is in it. Trust is important in a business, my friend. It doesn't matter whether the business is legal or not. Come, boys. You have come at the right time. Sit and have dinner first. Yes, Mr. Khan. Khan said that you gave them fake currency. Yes Baiji, we did. People in this business trust me blindly. What you did was not right. Have you lost your mind? Do you have a death wish? I will die only if it is drugs. It is salt. How did you know that this isn't real stuff? We have bribed one of Khan's men. He had informed us before hand. Baiji, I suggest we should start our own business. Khan is the uncrowned king of this business. And one needs loads of money to do business at such a large scale, boys. Baiji, once the car is in the right direction speed is your control. All you have to do is step on the accelerator. Keep this with you. There is risk at every step in what you are about to do. Be it in gambling, business, hitting a sixer or cards... One has to take a risk to score big, Baiji. "It was them against the world." "It was them against the world." "They ended up thrashing a cop." "The police kept looking for them." "And they kept plundering." "And they kept plundering." Brother, no one will give them a lift. It is an isolated road. They have a woman and a child with them. Why don't we give them our bike? You are feeling very generous? Police will get back to us through the bike. Three goons steal a businessman's car and cash in broad daylight... ...when he was going out with his wife and child. No, Baiji. No drinks. Otherwise, we won't be able to get up early. Where you do want to go early in the morning? Rajasthan, to get the stuff. At least let the matter cool down a little. Police is searching every nook and corner. And they have managed to trace your car. It's not a big deal. We will change the number plate. Not just the number plate, let's change the car itself. If there stuff has any impurities... ...we will kill you and bury you in these sand dunes. Keep this toy inside, man. When I can get the stuff from across the border... You are yet to see my weapons. I have automatic ones. Check if all the money is in it. Be careful on the way. There are many check posts on the way. I won't be responsible if you get caught. Let's go, uncle. We are done here. - Stop. Stop. Stop. - Stop. Stop. Stop. Pull over. Pull over. Pull over to this side. There is nothing in there, sir. The jeep is empty. Have some standards, sir. Where is the stuff? I had kept it in the boot. Give it here. Why did you hide the stuff in the trolley full of hay? We feared the one who gave us the goods might get us arrested. We were sleeping. Even we didn't realise when he stuffed it to the trolley. The car stopped, I opened my eyes. I thought that he had stopped to pee. What about the cops at the check post? The cops? Don't you think Khan Bhai would object this? You have managed to get the stuff this time. But what is the guarantee that you will be able to get it next time as well? There is no guarantee of life either, Mr. Ansari. Who knows whether we will take our next breath? If we stay breathing, we will get the goods. Khan Bhai has contacts in the capital. You need to assure us that we will be able to sell without restrictions. How will we benefit working with you anyway? We are charging half the price Khan does. All those who agree to the terms pay the advance and collect the stuff. You will soon know who is selling sand and who is selling gold. Khan Bhai, Karaj is trying to steal your position. Who delivered the stuff? Those three boys who gave fake currency to your men. Many dealers took stuff from Karaj because he is charging half the price. Your business will go bust if this continues. You burn your tongue if you have something too hot, Mr. Yadav. Hello, ACP? How are you doing? How are you, Mr. Karaj? Welcome, inspector. Please have a seat. There is a report that a huge consignment of heroin is here. White gold. I came to inform you because we go way back. Your three boys are getting very famous in Delhi. We have orders to arrest him. Who reported this? You know everything. Khan. Your crime list is way long. Be careful. You have many admirers in the city. Come, boys. Boys, why don't you go out for a few days? Khan is trying his best. Let's go to Goa, brother. Let's go to Goa then. How long will it take to reach there? Get in the car and I'll get you to Goa overnight. Where have we reached, Jogga? We have just entered Goa. This road looks just like the one in our city. I agree. Oh damn. There is an Uddam Singh Chowk in Goa as well? Goa is doing great. Brother, where's the sea? Why? Do you want to catch fishes? Now don't say there is no Baghdadi gate in Goa. Where had you gone, Jogga? To get Delhi motorboat tickets. Hello? Is that Gulinder Singh? Sir, I had some work with you. Can we meet? Jogga said he's take us to Goa and brought us back to our city instead. He fooled us. We let him fool us. And I enjoyed it. We had to kill time. Why are you getting your bones broken? Tell us who all were with you. Sir, someone has come to meet you. Hello, sir. Hello. Please have a seat. We had called to let you know that we wanted to meet. Yes, tell me. We wanted to get out verification done for urgent passports. Send the application to the SSP office. Then find out when the enquiry reaches our office. What about the expenses? Now that you are here, you might as well pay it. Disloyal women, bad cars, damaged weapons... ...friendly policemen will always betray you. Jogga. Deepa. Battery. Get four cups of tea. You scoundrels, you created a scene and left. Your father kept visiting us and troubling us every day. Congratulations on becoming an inspector. Thank you. But that's old news. Tell me, have you started a new business? We are into import and export business in Delhi. I thought you dogs must have gone far away. Yes, life took us far away. Where is Mehak these days? She is working at Genesis Nursing Home. She meets sometimes when she is passing by. Will you be staying here now? No. We have to settle some old scores. Where can we find Jagga? Jagga? 'Smuggler Kharak Singh came from Jagravan...' '...did smuggling near the border and settled here.' 'His son Nishan Singh Jagravan only changed his methods and not the business.' 'He smuggled drugs using a transport business as a cover.' 'And Kharak Singh's grandson, Jagga...' '...had a desire to follow his grandfather's path.' What brings you here, sir? We have purchased this land. We just came to pay a visit. The case on the land is still in the court. The court is yet to decide. We paid the money you owned the moneylender and took the land. You take the spare change you want and leave. You won't anything later. They have made fake documents with the help of the record holder. I am not here to hear your sad story. Will you walk out or should I drag you out. I'll rather die than lose my livelihood for my kids. You'll need it only if you have anyone left. Preeto. So angry? Seems like you want to kill me. You want to? You want to kill me? Here. Kill me. Stupid man, I just needed your prints on it. This is an illegal pistol. He killed his wife, people! Jagga has become Jagga, the dacoit. Oh I see. So he takes over disputed land. Jagga has his hands in too many businesses. Go on. Keep going back. Hello, sir. How are you, Lala? How's the business doing? Everything is going well, sir. We have a queue here. A queue? It seems like you fill more trucks than you fill the books. No, sir. You can ask your men. I am not skimming off any money. We wouldn't be troubling ourselves if the books were right. No, sir. Not a single penny is unaccounted for. We pay monthly bribe to the traffic police officers. They give us the exact count in the evenings. Do you think this is just sand? This isn't just sand, it is gold. And gold is quite expensive. The hand that betrays us becomes handicap forever. Forgive me, sir. I made a mistake. I'll never make such a mistake again. You should be grateful that I am letting you live... ...so that when people see you.. ..they fear even thinking about betraying us. Brother, this looks like a story of a movie. You are going to stay in the city for sometime anyway. You will soon find out. Every kid here knows what Jagga is capable of. Do mothers scare the kids by saying: Go to sleep, son, or Jagga will be here. Do you think I am joking. No problem. You will soon find out. There are many groups of youngsters in our city... ...and they keep clashing with each other. Our college is great! Great! Long live student union! Long live! Long live unity! Long live! Our college is great! Great! Long live student union! Long live! Long live unity! Long live! Jagga is the one who always appoints college presidents. He is your college's president henceforth. If anyone have any doubts or objections then let me know. Let's go, boys. Okay then, we will get going. Look, I know you are going to do as you please. But I would still suggest that you don't mess with Jagga. He surely has some support behind him. Support? Hello, brother. Come, Jagga. Where are you these days? I hardly get to see you. Just busy with work. The jobs you have given me. I thought there is peace in the city so Jagga must have gone on a vacation. I don't have the time to, brother. You should keep a strong hold or else people start questioning the leaders. Keep them busy. They will approach us only if they feel troubled. And it will keep you entertained. You are right, brother. What will I do otherwise? Why have they made me as a MLA? To serve them. I serve everyone well, brother. They never doubt you again. How's the business doing otherwise? Let me know if you need some pocket money. I am managing. With your blessings. Jagga, you know that the elections are just around the corner. It's an expensive affair. I want my vote bank to increase this time. Don't worry, brother. Whether we need to buy the votes or force them... We are all set. The parking contractor hasn't showed up. Pull his strings a little. Fine, I'll handle him. He cannot escape me. I know that. Okay then. We will keep meeting. I really feel like going home. I don't know how mother must be doing. I don't even know if she is alive. I too want to, but I am scared of father. Will we only keep discussing this? Let's go if we want to! Come over. Have tea and then leave. You have it. We'll have it some other time. Son, my eyes are weak. I didn't recognise you. Who are you? It's me, father, Deepa. - My Deepa? - Yes, father. - Wait, you scoundrel! - I'll get hurt, father! Father! - Wait! - Listen to me, father! - I'll get hurt, father! - Wait! - Listen to me, father! - Wait! He is going to get served well, Battery. Father! Father! You have grown old now. Stop thrashing me at least now. Scoundrel, why did you leave us when you knew I've grown old? Mother! Mother! Mother! Father, where's mother? She died waiting for you and shedding tear for you. No, father! It's locked, brother. Let's ask the neighbours, Battery. Yes, let's check. Auntie, a woman used to stay here. Yes, she used to. Her son was a wayward, he left her alone. Youngsters these days are no good. We don't even know whether he is alive or not. We asked about the woman who used to live here. Do you know anything about her? Where is she? Where can she go? She must be washing utensils at someone's residence. She has a stomach. She needs to feed it. Jogga, it that you? Yes, mother. Where did you go, leaving me all alone? You knew I didn't have anyone other than you in this world. Battery. Mother, he is my friend, Battery. I seek your blessings. God bless you, son. Let's go inside, son. Get it here, Battery. Let's take a nap. Here son, have some water. Why are you taking the trouble, mother? Have a seat. Jogga, whose is that big car? Ours, mother. You have a big job? Yes, mother. A very big job. He has cars in front of him and behind him and police all around him. What? Police? He means police officers, mother. I don't understand you kids. - I'll go make tea for you. - Sit down, mother. You must be tired. I won't let you work for others anymore. You have worked enough. I need to kill time as long as I am alive, son. I am so tired, mother. Can I place my head on your lap and sleep? Yes, son. Massage my head, mother. I'll go to sleep. Son, when you were small, you used to go to play... ...and come back tired to sleep on my lap. I used to massage your head and you used to fall asleep. Son, don't leave me alone. If you leave, then take me along. Hey, you still haven't given us the account details. Brother was asking for it. I just met him. Brother, I am short of cash. Don't you know that I need to collect and hand over everything... ...in order to meet my ends? I have so much manpower. Do you think it is easy to manage them? You are right, brother. But others haven't paid me. Now do you want me to do your collection for you? If I get a little easy with you guys, you start saying your sad stories. When will you pay up? Or do I need to find another solution for you? No, brother. I'll pay by this evening. I'll sell something if I need to. I'll make the arrangement. I think something is wrong with my horoscope. Whenever I try to the right thing, something wrong happens. And whenever my mind takes the wrong direction.. ..things work out right. Get up, Jogga. Have some tea. Battery! Battery! He's in deep sleep. Have some tea. Here Battery, have some tea. I slept so well, Battery. Brother, I have never slept so well at night either. A home will always be a home. You can never get the kind of peaceful sleep you get at home anywhere else. You are right, mother. Brother, shall we call Deepa? I think his father must have kicked him out this time. You are right. How are you? Survived the thrashing, did you? Listen, let's go to meet Mehak. Hey mister, move your car. Yes? What yes? Are you deaf? I said move your car, I need to get my car out. Nonsense. I don't know where they come from! Move your car, sir. You aren't allowed to park here. We are waiting only for two minutes. Stop troubling us. You can stay the night here, if you want. I don't care. Just park the car elsewhere. He's unnecessarily trouobling us. Just tell us where's Mehak madam. I don't know. Stop troubling me. Please tell us. Why are you getting angry? That's must better. You should show respect. If you had spoken politely earlier then I'd introduce you to her by now. Why not now? How can I? She just left right in front of you after sharing those kind words with you. Oh no, the one with the car? Yes, the one with the car. You are making faces like you've seen Laden. Just let us know which department does she work in and what are her timing. Come in the morning. Stop troubling me. - Deepa? - Yes? Meet us at AAA. We will have some fun. Come on. What took you so long? Where have you been? Let's meet and talk. Hold on for a second. Tell me, what will you drink? No, we won't drink. We have come home after a long time. We need to go back home to mother. It doesn't seem right. Can we at least eat something? I am starving. Order something to eat. I have someone waiting for me. I will be back in 10 minutes. Please. Yes. You are there? Yes, I am coming. Do we tell Gabby about our work in Delhi? No. We don't know what he will think about us if he finds out. Sorry, sir. This table is reserved. We'll pay for it. Not possible, sir. Drop it. Why are you troubling us? Don't you understand? My grandfather used to rule Jagravan. And my father rules the truck union since the past 25 years. And now I, Jagga, rules this area. There is no one who doesn't know that this seat is reserved for a special person. And I am sure even an outsider does learn about it. Be it an officer or a leader, the person sitting on the seat keeps changing. Be it a bus or a plane, passengers keep changing. Jagga's stamp is always on the things that belong to Jagga. Forget sitting on it, people don't think about it. I hope you have understood. Why don't you make us understand? I thought so. That I will have to make you understand. I am not make sounds like those small firecrackers. I like to soar into the sky and cause an explosion. Oh no. I should get out of here. The scoundrels ran away. They cannot escape after disturbing a beehive. Come here. Who was they who dared to mess with me? I don't know. They are new here. I have never seen them here before. They will die the next time I will see them. Are you still at the restaurant? - I'm coming there. - Let it be. We got into a fight over there. Then meet me at the hills. If I hadn't switched off the lights and got you out of there... ...then we wouldn't have needed an excuse to meet Mehak in the morning. They would've thrashed us enough to get admitted in the hospital. They get together these days. I didn't know Jagga would come there and cause trouble. If we knew he was coming there then we would have gone there on purpose. I understand how you feel. But he is in power. I would suggest that you be patient and don't be angry. Did you go to meet Mehak? We did. I knew it. That's why I called you. I thought I should find out what happened. She had gone off duty by the time we went there. Speak up, man. Do you want me to call her up so that you can talk to her? I am sure that will get you into a happy mood. No. It is not so. Let's go home. Mother must be waiting. Let's go, brother. As you wish. We have come at the right time, Battery. You are back, son. Freshen up, boys. There is some warm water in the jug. - Come here, Battery. - Coming. Come and wash your hands. Serve us dinner, mother. Okay son, I'll serve it. Sit on the cot, son. I'll serve you over there. No, mother. We have got this opportunity after a long time. We managed to survive with great difficulty... ...reminiscing our childhood days. Fine, son. You can eat over here. Take this. Am I dreaming? No, my naive mother. You aren't. Battery? Battery? Yes, brother? Mehak didn't recognise me in the morning. Yes, brother. She met you after a long time. Will she talk to me tomorrow morning? Yes, she will. Battery? Battery? Yes, brother? Will she scold me? Like she had today? No, brother. Battery? Battery! Yes, brother? "Should I fall for your blue eyes?" "Or should I fall for sharp nose?" "Should I fall for your beautiful neck?" "Or should I fall for slim waist?" "Should I fall for your blue eyes? Or should I fall for sharp nose?" "Should I fall for your beautiful neck? Or should I fall for slim waist?" "It feels like we know each other since past life when you look into my eyes." "I get a feeling of deja vu when you embrace me." "A feeling of deja vu when you embrace me." "Your eyes..." "Your eyes..." "I am high from the time I saw you." "You are a miracle, that's why I am in love with you." "Flowers have shared their hue with you." "You are a miracle, that's why I am in love with you." "Flowers have shared their hue with you." "I know that it's just not me, you love me too." "I get a feeling of deja vu when you embrace me." "A feeling of deja vu when you embrace me." "Like a star..." "Like a star..." "I like your sparkling nose ring more than the moon." "I like your sparkling nose ring more than the moon." "There is different, nothing compares to your beauty." "I know you think about me too." "There is different, nothing compares to your beauty." "I feature in your dreams and you feature in mine." "I get a feeling of deja vu when you embrace me." "A feeling of deja vu when you embrace me." "It's true..." "It's true..." "You love me... and I love you." "You love me, and my beloved, I love you." This land is at a prime location. Right on the road. We have won it at an auction. Other parties used to increase the rates whenever we tried to make a deal. The showroom is right at road. All of them are commercial plots. You should talk to the MLA. People will buy the plots in no time. Consider that I have already spoken to the MLA. It is my responsibility to get the work done by him. But what will I get? We cannot escape you. We will do as you say. You can take whatever percentage you usually do. How much percentage are you assuming? We have already kept a million aside for you. A plot and a showroom for the MLA. Give these meagre percentages to brokers. I am not a broker, I do partnerships. 50 percentage. Let me know if you are okay with it. Otherwise, you may leave. That's too much. But it's okay. Let us think over it and let you know. The more time you take to think the more interest you'll have to pay. So the less you think the better it will be you. If so much payment is blocked then your hearts will get blocked as well. Deepa? Be respectful. Otherwise, things will go south. Remember us? We were here yesterday. Why do I need to? Are you my cousins? I see so many people every day. Tell me what work you have. We wanted to meet Mehak madam. Who Mehak? This is the first time I heard her name. Okay, Mehak madam. She is in Dr. SP Sachdeva's room. Go inside, first room on the right. I made 100 bucks! Yes? How can I help? I wanted to meet the doctor. Okay. What's the problem? I don't feel hungry anymore after I eat something. And he cannot see after he goes to sleep. You don't need medicines. You need thrashing. What? Yes. We also have a doctor to treats mad people. Let me go call him. No Mehak, you are mistaken. Wait, I'll call the security. - Mehak! - Security! Listen to me! - I am Jogga. - I am Deepa. Battery! You should get lost, no matter what your name is. Be it Battery Torch, Jogga Moga. I don't care what your name is, just get out... Jogga? Deepa? Battery? The trios? I don't believe this. Back after all these years? Actually, we had gone out for work. Oh. I think you should leave right away. Doctor will be here any moment now. We will meet later. - Okay, bye. - Okay, bye. What is it now? This is our number. Call when you are free. Stupid boys. Who knows whether she will take the number or not. He'll try to give it. What did she say? Will she call? She said why should she call? Look at his face. She will call. She will call in the afternoon. Brother, my son's critically ill. We need o positive blood. If any of you could donate it? Don't worry, we will get ours checked. Okay. Thank you, brother. Sit here, I'll get milk and bananas for you. No brother, it's okay. Thank you. Brother, Mehak still hasn't called. It's 2 o'clock. You should've said that sooner and she would have called sooner. Hello? Okay. What is she saying? It was Baiji from Delhi. He said everything is settled. We should come back. We will have to go back one day. Why didn't tell him that we will come back in a few days. Call him back. I think it's Baiji, again. Hello? Okay. What did Baiji say? It was Mehak and not Baiji. Oh. She wants us to meet her in the canteen. You boys seem to be very happy. What happened? Did you have a son? Not a son. But we found the son's father's wife. They are either high or crazy. Hey trios, welcome. How are all of you? - Good. - Good. Good. Uncle, four cups of coffee, please. No, three cups of tea and one cup of coffee. Okay. Then I too will have tea. Uncle, four cups of tea please. I must say, you guys are great actors. I didn't realise it. If you had taken some more time to realise then we would have been thrashed. Yes, that is true. So, what's going on these days? Import-export. Wow. Import-export. What goods? Sandwich. Sandwich? Yes, I mean would anyone like to eat sandwiches? Oh. No. Actually, not for now. I am late. I needed to go to the market. See you guys later? Bye. Mehak's nature hasn't changed at all. She is just as bubbly as she was. Nature doesn't change, it just develops as you age. Brother, didn't you have to call Karaj bhai? Oh yes. We three discussed this. Can we spend a few more days here? You don't need to ask, Jogga. Okay, Baiji. Bye. We have come back to our city after a long time. I am liking it over here. We are all lliking it here. But the most important thing to do is get Jagga. Let's ask Gabby where can we find him. Call him up. We need to get him. Who knows when will he leave. Time doesn't matter when a hunter waits for a prey. You should opt for guerrilla warfare then the enemy forces are strong. They are here. His mother won't be expecting him home today. He has ruined our lives. Hurry up. The railway crossing had to stop now? He got away. Jogga, go inside and sit. I'll go and get something to eat. Battery, you come with me. Why are you guys running like wild bulls? Who do you plan to crush? No, we just came to call Battery to let him know that the show is about to begin. But what are you doing here? I invited her, by calling her up. Oh I see. Look at this, our entire childhood is together now. We, the five great experts! Let's go. Don't you want to go inside and watch the movie? The show is about to start. Hurry up. 'A person's soul slowly dying every day is more painful than the physical death.' 'I will fill Jagga's life with such a poison that...' '...Jagga will find death better than the hellish life.' Brother, Jagga is in a much better position than us. He has more men and more money as well. Just because he has hills and the MLA's support. He is better! Then let's attack the hills. And take off the MLA's support. "Even a chicken looks like a pigeon." "Even a chicken..." "The enemies are coming closer, my dear..." "My dear..." "It is time to look carefully." "Look carefully." "Look carefully." "Look carefully." This is good stuff. I never had this kind of stuff. What about our job? Consider your job done. MLA sir, we get very less water. By the time water reaches our fields, our turn is over. The boy who distributes pensions in our area... ...says that he would give us our pension only if we give him half of it. - Note it down. - Yes, sir. MLA sir, the opposition's has charged my son with eve teasing. Gajjan Singh, ask your son to apologise. You know the elections are just around the corner. Sometimes, such issues cause big trouble to us. Media hunts for such news like a hungry dog huts for food. Note it down. We will do something. Done, sir. Enjoy your tea and snacks. I'll see you guys later. Let me know if any of you have any issues pending. Bye. Dad, he is my friend Jogga. - Hello. - Have a seat. Yes, son. Tell me. I wanted to give some funds for your party. How much? 2000? 20 million. Cash. 20 million? What do you want in exchange? Youth president-ship. We already have a president. He is working well for the party. No problem, I'll talk to some other party. Victory and loss matter to you, MLA sir. I just need a plank outside the door. A licence. You are quite mature for your age. What work do you do? Smuggling. What if I get you arrested right away? I have enough information about you, sir. I know you won't do that. That too when you are being offered a profitable deal. You won't get the president's post just by throwing money around. You need to get youth with you. It's a struggle. Give me a chance, sir. Confidence is a good thing. But overconfidence can ruin you. You will know the results before the elections. Fine, let's see. Hello, Baiji. Baiji, I need stuff in Punjab. I have got hold of a very big game. Someone make the phone call. Get the drugs. My bones are aching. I feel like dying. It is difficult to get any these days. And those who have it are selling it at 5000 a kilo. It is filled with sand, sawdust and crushed pills. Here's a card for you. Damn the government. They have stopped drugs. All the druggies are as good as dead. It was getting dirty. There was hardly anyone left who hadn't tasted it. We used to have two spoons full in the morning and work like a machine. Now the body doesn't function without it. I tried the pills, they don't work at all. I am getting cramps. I am having a tough time since morning cleaning my rare. Original stuff is not available. I am sure it is diluted stuff. Rob someone. Find a solution. - Did you find something? - I cannot wait any longer. A very potent stuff has come in the market. A small pouch is enough to keep you high all day. What's so special about it? Heroin. It is expensive. A took two pouches. We will sell it and keep some back to enjoy it for free. Get them. I'll shoot the ones who try to run away. Throw them all into the jeep. And seize their brewery. What's the use of keeping the things in the car, inspector? You'll have to keep everything back where it was when Jagga will call you. I don't talk to anyone over the phone. Whoever wants to talk to me can come to my police station. Come with me, I'll teach you a lesson. Take them along. Let's teach them a lesson. Every party is trying hard these days to win the election. Election! Election! Election! The greed for the power and position don't let you rest in peace, father. Jagga Bhai, police raided our breweries. Our trucks filled with poppy seeds also got caught. Talk to the MLA. MLA doesn't meet me. And he seems to have blocked my number as well. Our party is working against drugs. We are concerned about our youth. In near future we will eradicate drugs from the society. I assure you of that. Hello? Jagga here. President. I want to talk to the MLA. I'll ask him to. He's giving an interview to a TV channel. Hold on. Sir, Jagga the president has called. He is on hold. Which president? There are 20 such presidents here. Don't answer just anybody's calls. Father, seems like someone is playing a big game against me. According to the circumstances, instead of making someone your weakness... ...you should become someone's weakness. Jagga, do you know why was your grandfather... ...addressed as Kharak Singh Jagravan? Because he came from Jagravan and ruled this city. In order to take that name forward... ...I didn't let anyone rise against me in the truck union. When you will start taking your own decisions... ...then people will start addressing you as Jagga Jagravan. Why are you working? How dare you stop working? How dare you come here! You remember how I made you leave? Jagga bhai, every dog has his day. Times have turned. Someone else has taken over these hills now. Who doesn't like his life that he dared to mess with me? Power gives you a strange high. Your feel crushed when you come out of it. Did you recognise me? Very well. I need to settle the fight in the hotel as well. The day you guys ran with your tails between your legs. We need to settle something that happened way back. I am Deepa. Jogga. Battery. Remember us? Yes, I remember. Three tiny hungry puppies messing with Jagga, a lion? You love to stay together, don't you? I'll bury all three of you right here. Don't you dare do anything stupid, Jagga. Well done, inspector. You take bribes from me and protect my enemies? It is how the world works. Everyone respects the rising sun and not the sun that sets. Let's go to the police station. For what? When your time is bad, you are not safe anywhere. That settles our account. Puppies climb up a branch and assume that they are no longer in danger. Boys, whenever you get down, the lion will be waiting for you. And the account isn't settled as yet. This story has just begun. Actually, my actions mimic that of dengue. I always give people a second chance to make amends. Otherwise, your cells go down and you go... up. Arrest him. Oh I see. Now I know who is holding the remote of this game. You should always bet on the winning horse... ...and not the lame horse, Jagga. What you did with Jagga was bad. You got him stuck in a legal case. Why did you do this? So that he cannot join another party. You would have got a huge blow, MLA sir... ...if your party's youth president joined another party. Media would have exaggerated the matter. No one would have said that we kicked him out of the party. Elections are just around the corner. Jagga had meetings with other parties, dad. But they had a surveillance on him and we were lucky. And he was unlucky. And your other formula worked as well, boys. Dad, there are no other drugs available in the market. Ask the officers to be more strict... ...so that no other drug enters the market. There should be only heroin everywhere. We need alcohol and poppy seeds during elections. Youth vote the most, MLA sir. And till the elections don't get over, youth will want only one thing. Heroin. I'll fix your meeting with all the colleges, ITI, village club presidents. Distribute your goods everywhere. Even if you have to distribute it for free the first time. People will follow us like flies follow sweets. What's the target expected to cross in a month's time? The quantity of stuff we have received dad... ...if it gets distributed all across the area... ...then it will take care of all the expenses of the elections. Don't lose focus because of overexcitement. Be careful not to fall flat on your face. Mehak isn't answering my calls. Message her that we are in the canteen. You are right. Is it good, Deepa? First propose to her. Hello! Hi, everyone. How's everything, trios? All good? It was a very busy day today. Mehak, Jogga wants to discuss something important with you. Oh really? What do you want to say? That's why you kept calling me, right? You know I was on duty at the emergency ward today. School students came in, they were so small. Drugs overdose. Two died on the spot. And the other two are still critical. These synthetic drugs are very dangerous. All those who deal in drugs should be hanged. I'll kill the person responsible for it. Are you okay? I am fine. Forget that. Didn't you have something important to discuss? No, it's nothing. What's wrong with you? Why are you sweating so much? Are you okay? Yes. No, it's nothing. I feel unwell, that's why. Come on, let's get you checked up. No, I am fine. We'll get going now. We'll meet when we are free. Hey, hey, hey. What happened? It's Karaj bhai. Hello? Hello, Baiji. Hello, boys. Congratulations to you. Jogga has become the youth president. That's great news. That's why you don't talk to me. You fear that you might have to give me a party. You should come over, Baiji. We will give you a party you'll never forget. Fine, I'll come to Punjab then. I'll get to meet the youth president as well. Did you get the payment for our stuff? Yes, Baiji. Okay then. Lord Almighty, like my son came back... ...I pray that my husband too should return. You never leave anyone disappointed. Be generous, my Lord. Why are you so worried, brother? Mehak doesn't know that we do this work. You are back, son. Go inside and seek blessings. Here son, have some water. Mother, you keep working all day long. Why don't you sit for some time? - Don't you get tired? - It's okay, son. - Are you alright, son? - Yes. - How's things at work? - Good. Mother, what do you keep asking God for? Beautiful wives for the two of you. That will give you a reason to stay at home. We were about to almost get a wife for one of us today. Like you got pulled towards your home... ...I hope that your father might return as well. Father? Mother, you never told me about him. I have kept it hidden in my heart from quite some time. I thought you might take a wrong step. But now, it is time to tell you. What's the secret that you needed to hide it from me? My parents had to keep your father with them... ...because I didn't have a brother. But my uncles wanted to take over our land. Then what happened, mother? My uncle fixed a false case against your father. By bribing inspector Muktair, who was your father friend. Then father got punished? No son, police says that he ran away before the hearing took place. Some say that he went across the border. And some say that he went abroad. I too want to share something with you, mother. I don't have a big job. You son sells drugs which ruins other people's life. Tell me that you are lying. Get out of my house. Why didn't I die before I heard this? I didn't bring you up right. You have returned as a devil in disguise. Get lost from here. - Mother! - Leave this place. Don't show me your face again. Go back to where you came from. - Go away. Get lost. - Listen to me, mother. Go away. Get lost. I have realised my mistake, mother. - Let's go. - Don't show me your face again. Try to understand, mother. Manager, reserve this seat permanently for our youth president. The person whose seat it was got promoted. And he has become a VIP now. What is wrong? Where are you lost? Come back to our party, man. Even alcohol seems to be betraying me today. It is not getting me drunk. Then try something new. We will know whether it is pure or diluted. - No, I don't do drugs. - Take it. This is poison that takes away your money. Once it enters your body it ruins it. It ruins your honour at home and in the society. There are fights all the time. There is no peace in the house. Heroin can turn a well to do person into a beggar and a thief. Well done. You have given a great speech. I will ask dad to take you along on stage. You are good at giving lectures. "I hope I don't turn into a poem, falling in love with you." Let's ask Karaj bhai where he has reached. Call and ask him. And let's go and collect the money from home. We need to give them to Baiji. Help! Help! "The entered into a fight to help someone unknown." "To help someone unknown." "The entered into a fight to help someone unknown." "They started fighting for them." "They fought and caused a traffic jam." "Two groups started fighting." "Two groups started fighting." "Two groups started fighting." Damn you! Let me go! Papa, I don't know what would have happened if those boys in that car wouldn't have helped me. No, my dear. It's okay. - Hello? - Jogga? Hello, Baiji. I am staying in Hotel Gagan. Come here. Okay, Baiji. We got into trouble last night, Jogga. A gun was fired and a man is dead. But my pistol still has all the bullets. They must have traced our car by now. Let's leave it here. Let's get out of here then. Stop over here. Here. - Hello, Baiji. - Hello to everyone. - Come, son. - Hello, Baiji. Jogga, talk to the MLA. He has contacts. He can suppress the matter. What happened? Baiji, when we left the hotel yesterday... ...a few boys were kidnapping a girl. He killed a minister's son. Let's go live and talk to the minister about it. What do you have to say about this, sir? I don't know any Jogga. As far as our party is concerned, we have nothing to do with him. We heard that you had a lot of meetings with him. He kept visiting your house. What do you have to say about this? I am an elected representative of the people. So many people come to visit me every day. Today you are here. Tomorrow if you go and kill someone... ...will I be held responsible for that as well? Stop blabbering. Let's go. When we tried to talk to the minister... ...he tried to evade the questions. Now let's see how long does it take for the police to arrest them. Hello, Mehak? Gabby isn't answering our calls. We are in Hotel Gagan. If you speak to him, tell him to call us immediately. It's urgent. They were shallow vessels, they spilled too soon. How could I trust them! Don't worry, dad. Shut up and sit right there. You'll get whatever you want right here. You don't need to go out. Keep your phone switched off. Or else I'll break your legs. Dad! Elections are around the corner. They got me into new trouble now. Boys, I suggest you go back to Delhi. I'll handle everything over here. Why should we run when we didn't kill him, Baiji? But we are accused of the murder. Don't be stubborn, Jogga. I cannot run anymore, Baiji. I am going to surrender myself. You guys can leave if you want, Deepa. We have always been together, since childhood. You want us to leave you now? Well done. Forget living without you, we cannot even die without you. Trios? The boy who died his father is contesting the elections. I won't be able to do anything if some other team. It won't be in my hands. That's why you will have to surrender. We don't need to worry as long as you are here. Phones aren't allowed in there. You can get everything inside. Give me a pen, Gabby. Baiji, this is my home address. My mother will be home. Money's in the green bag. Ask her for it and she will give it to you. Okay, fine. Take care of yourself. Yes, okay. Take this, Gabby. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. I'll update you as soon as I have any information. Okay. Gabby, you guys leave. I'll be there. Be careful, Jogga. Don't do anything stupid. I am risking my job and trying to save you guys. What such work do you have where we cannot go along? I am going to meet mother. Mother is in shock since last night because of that thing. I don't want her to think wrong about all of us by seeing us together. Don't worry. I'll be back soon. Jogga, police has set up check posts everywhere. Do one thing, take Mehak with you. No one gets suspicious, if you have a girl with you. Be careful. Meet us at the high hills. We'll show that we arrest you guys there. Let's go. Mother? Mother? Mother? Open the door, mother. Mother? Open the door, mother. Open the door just once. Open the door, mother. I want to make amends. I have realised my mistake. I am going to surrender myself to the police. Just once. Just place your hand on my head, mother. If I had taken your blessings the last time I had left... ...then perhaps I wouldn't have ended up in this filthy business. Believe me, mother. I will never do anything that would hurt your feelings again. I don't deserve to be forgiven. But please forgive me if you can. Bye, mother. I am leaving. 'What was Jogga doing here?' 'He perhaps came to tell his mother about the money.' Davinder, you? Where did you go leaving us alone? You didn't miss us at all? oh God, how did this happen? Deepa, you said that we have always done everything together. Then how could you die alone? 'Forget living without you, we cannot even die without you.' Battery! Shoot me. Come on. Poor Jogga isn't capable of anything. Mehak, you too? The girl you spent your life loving is standing right next to me. I have all the bullets of your pistol. I feel so sorry for you. You look like a beggar outside a temple. I feel like giving all the bullets back to you. But I cannot, as the police department won't allow me to. I knew that we either will die in prison or get shot by the police. I didn't deserve Mehak. I was anyway going to ask you to look after Mehak. You thought that you would drive a fancy car... ...and I'll get impressed and choose you as my life partner? How... how could you even think about it? You are a petty criminal. You know I love Gabby. I joined your group because he asked me to... ...and leaked all your information. Remember the dialogue you used to say? Friendly policemen, disloyal women... I don't remember the rest. It was something like that, right? It suits him. You did all this for Mehak? But Deepa and Battery? What was their fault? All three of you will have to die. The one who asked me do this is your... - 'Inspector? - Yes?' 'Can I have a word with you?' 'End the story in such a way that only the king stays alive.' 'Secrets will get revealed if they stay alive.' Karaj bhai cannot do this. I was issued death warrant once by MLA Bhuttar... ...the one whose you guys are disciples of. He promised me money as well as promotion. And the other by the MLA whose son was murdered. That I can believe in. And they are capable of doing that. And another childhood friend of yours. Inspector, I am restricted by these prison walls. Otherwise, it won't take me long. If you are so desperate then why don't you come out and do it? I cannot wait any longer. I just want him dead. If I do it, it will be considered as a murder by law. If you do it, it will be an encounter. Eradicating criminals from the society. The job will be done. Then you will get the reward even before you ask for it. Remember what you did to Jagga, don't you? We didn't do anything compared to what Jagga had done to us. If he hadn't told the inspector about us... ...then our train wouldn't have gone off the track. Not Jagga, I told the inspector about you guys. I still cannot believe that you can do such things. But why? Why? Because the inspector your father murdered was my father. You are lying. Your mother won't lie, will she. I heard this story when I was a little boy... ...your mother had recited it, in my own house. I lost my father because of that incident. And my mother... became a widow. We have waited for your father's murderer for a long time. You can seek revenge from children too, you know. Settle the account. Your father wasn't an angel either. He betrayed my father. I was looking for your father. But I couldn't find him. To seek revenge from him, I am the one... ...who caused a rift between you and Jagga. When you guys ran away to Delhi after stealing the grains... ...I felt some peace in my heart. So, you pretended to be my friend. What friendship? When you all came back from Delhi... ...my desire to get revenge came back to life. I wanted Jagga to kill you all. That's why I took you to that restaurant that day. Then at the mall. But you guys managed to escape. Now tell me who killed that boy as well. Killed who? The MLA's son? I was behind that as well. I got my men join his group. Then are the ones who kidnapped the girl. You took your gun out and one of my men fired his gun. That resulted in you getting another enemy. Then these four death angels surrounded you. You lost, Jogga. I never valued winning or losing when it came to friendship. There is just one bullet. Who will you shoot? Disloyal beloved or a friend who turned enemy? This is a serious dilemma. I could have shot you as well. But I don't want to kill you. I want to keep you alive. So that you regret killing two innocent friends for the rest of your life. You consider me your enemy. But for me, you are still a friend. And I am about to be killed by my friend. What could make me happier? Anyway, I cannot survive without Deepa and Battery. Shoot me. Come on, shoot me. There you go then. "If you and I were to compete somewhere, you back stabber..." "If you and I were to compete somewhere, you betrayer..." "You wouldn't have found a way to escape, my dear." "My dear, who are you crushing under your feet now?" Sorry, Mehak. If you can betray someone who loved you more than his own life... ...then how can you be loyal to anyone else? Anyway, private persons can cause trouble in top-secret government matters. Bye. - Jogga! - Jogga, my son! What is wrong with my son? - Take care of yourself, mother. - What happened? I want someone like you as my mother in my next life as well. Give me your blessings, mother. I am very tired. Can I sleep on your lap? Please massage my head, mother. Don't lose hope, son. Bye, Baiji. Don't call me Baiji, Jogga! I am your father! Call me father, Jogga! "I might have many faults and flaws." "But still my loved ones..." "But still my loved ones will cry for me..." Today on high hills, near the city bypass... ...three dangerous gangsters Jogga, Deepa, Battery... ...and a female accomplice died in police encounter. A police officer lost his life as well. This is Gurleen Batra live from the crime scene for the News Channel, Ferozpur. Like the saying goes when elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers. This is first time that both the grass and the elephants suffered. Here you go. Check out his weapon. See how good it is. Also decide who gets shot in the hand who gets shot in the leg. We need to report close firing in the case. Right? You guys will never progress. 'I couldn't save the life of the one who saved my daughter.' Our job is to end crime and not criminals. It is because of such officials that... ...criminals don't want to choose the right path. He killed the one who saved my daughter right in front of me. I regretfully couldn't do anything about. Not all public servants are the same. Our department has a bad name because of filthy people like you. Jagga bhai, you have been bailed out. 'Just like a snake, our mind too produces poison.' 'Our mind uses that poison as a weapon.' 'Pistol, rifle, tank, missile.' 'These things are operated by our hands.' 'But our hands our commanded by our mind.' 'We think that weapons kills people.' 'But what kills people is a person's mind.' "We are a little different. We are a little crazy." "We don't forget the ones who mess with us." "We have enough wealth and fame. We only seek God's blessings and refuge." "We are a little different. We are a little crazy." "We don't forget the ones who mess with us." "We have enough wealth and fame. We only seek God's blessings and refuge." "Tell me, who wants to challenge me?" "Jagga, Jaggera is standing right here." "I have taken care of all those who acted smart." "Death follows those who try to mess with us." "We are a little different. We are a little crazy." "We don't forget the ones who mess with us." "We have enough wealth and fame. We only seek God's blessings and refuge." "We are true to our friends. We don't fight over girls." "We don't entertain those people who don't meet our expectations." "We are as furious as fire. We have been wild since forever." "We are a little different. We are a little crazy." "We don't forget the ones who mess with us." "We have enough wealth and fame. We only seek God's blessings and refuge."
