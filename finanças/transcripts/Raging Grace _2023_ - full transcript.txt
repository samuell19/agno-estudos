Ugh. Gravy? Okay, Mommy! Go. I'll meet you at the end of the road. Good morning, Mrs. Clark. -Welcome home. -Ate Joy! Hey. Wow, you know Filipino now? His cousins in Singapore call their maid that. It's so sweet! I came to return your key. Lovely to see you. Uh-huh. I think she's got it, babe. I've been all over Southeast Asia. Cambodia, Vietnam, Kenya. But the Philippines... I'll say, was my favorite. The "Filipinnies" are such a nice people. Got the 15? I've got 10. Why do you people always do this? I say "15," you bring 10. I say, "No," you say, "That's all I have." This is what I do. This is my craft. I don't ask you to do your job for cheap, do I? What do you do? I don't care. But I guarantee it's not hard or as risky... as making you a citizen of this country. I swear down, this is my last gig. Take the 10. -I'll get you the rest. -And then what? I chase you for the rest of the money? Nah. It's 15. Not 10. Not 11. Not 14 and a half. End of next month, I'm out of here. Get it to me by then or don't. I don't care. But don't waste my time again. Hi. Matt speaking. Hi. Who's this? Warrington Smith here. We are away from the 10th to the 16th. Leave us a message and we'll get back to you. Grace! Okay. Thank you, Joy. Grace? Grace? Grace, this isn't funny. Grace? - Roar! - Oh, my God! Okay, Come on. It's time for homework. My homework. Don't you think that...? I don't think you can do that, anak. Why? You said we don't have any pictures of my dad. No, not yet. Wait. Grace, this is somebody else's medicine. This is sleepy medicine. But I did. Grace? Grace? You can't have this fucking baby! Oh! You must be our new cleaner. Mr. Garrett? Hello? Mr. Garrett? Mr. Garrett? Mr. Garrett? Hello? Mr. Garrett? Mr. Garrett? My name is Joy. Your friend Yuval sent me to check up on you. Mr. Garrett? Excuse me. You must be the new help. Help... Yes, I'm the new help. Good. I wasn't sure the agency could send me somebody at such short notice. You really are a sight for sore eyes. I'm Katherine. -Oh, hi, Karen, I'm... -No. Katherine. I'm Joy. Nice to meet you, ma'am. No, no. No need for formalities. "Katherine" will suffice, yes? I see you've already met dear Uncle Nigel. Is it...? It is, I'm afraid. Dreadful disease. Just so slow. Seems so bloody cruel. Forgive me. -No, I'm... I'm sorry. -Right. Best not to dwell. Let's get you settled in, shall we? Have you been with the Kipling Agency long? Um, no. Well, this place hasn't seen any TLC for quite some time, as you can see. Now, this would normally be a long-term post, but circumstances being what they are, it could be anything to two weeks, two months, who knows? And this will be yours for the duration of your stay. -My room? -Yes. There is an en suite, and more storage than you can fill, I should imagine. This will do, yes? It's beautiful. Thank you. I'm sure you've probably dealt with worse, but there's a kitchen under all of this, I can assure you. You do cook, I assume? -Yes, ma'am, I do. -Katherine. I'm sorry. -Katherine. -Excellent. Now, we eat simply in this house. Nothing exotic. And no fish or shellfish. I have terrible allergies, do you understand? Yes. Canned goods and dry foods are in here. My uncle's medication is on the top shelf. It's organized into a daily pillbox, and morphine is in the fridge for the bad days. You would like me to give him his pills every morning? No, no. I'll cover that. The rest is just general upkeep. The room is ready whenever you'd like to move in, but I should assume you'd want to get started immediately. Shall we say tonight? Yes, Miss Katherine, ma'am. Wonderful. Now, before I forget, I have a rather naughty proposal. I know you work for the agency, but... would you consider working for me privately? I can't give you agency rates, but I can do 1,000 a week. That will be cash. I'd be very happy with that. I can do that. Joy, you've made my day. Thank you. Thank you, ma'am. Right. I'll, uh... -I'll see you later. -Thank you, ma'am. - Mm-hmm. Um... Bye-bye. A big job. We're going to have our own place the entire holiday. Really? Help me with the suitcase. Will we have our own bed? Oh, my gosh. This is amazing! I can't believe I'll get my own bed. Are you ready? Joy, welcome. That's it, come in. Come in. Oh, wow. Lord, you must be exhausted lugging this big thing around with you all day. Door, please. Would you like a cup of tea? Oh, you do drink tea, don't you? Yes, but, um, maybe I should unpack first, ma'am. You can do that later. Come on. I insist. So... I want to know... all about you. Sugar? No, thank you. Um... You must have traveled thousands of miles to reach these shores. Quite the story, I should imagine. Philippines? -Yes. How did you know? -It's in the face. You must have left family back home. - Yes. - Husband? No. No. Children? Chin-chin. Thank you... ma'am. Katherine. May I go unpack, please? Yes, dear. Of course. Oh, my God. Grace? Wake up, Grace. Grace! That was too long. Don't do that. I thought you were dead. Come here. I'm so sorry, anak. - You scared me. - Joy? Joy! Everything okay? I was calling you. You didn't hear? I'm so-- I'm sorry. No, uh, is everything all right? Yes. Settling in, yes. Well, it's your room. Make yourself at home. Uh, do let me know if you need anything. Thank you. Grace. You need to promise me that every time that woman is in this house... Okay? Okay, I promise. It's always temporary. Can you help me unpack... Can I sleep on the right side? Oh, anak. Grace, anak. Come. You said we'd have our own bed. I know... Mommy? Just six weeks, okay? I promise. I'm sorry, ma'am. You scared me. This is my least favorite part of the day. - I can do this for you-- - No! No, it's fine. Right... I'm off out for the morning. Please do carry on. -Yes, ma'am. -Katherine, thank you. Gloria... Huh? Mr. Garrett? What are you doing? Umma, you swore, Mommy. Grace, what are you doing here? That woman isn't here. This isn't a game, Grace. After this, I need you to go back to the room. -But I'm bored! -Shh! Lower your voice, Grace. Ah, there you are! Hard at work, I see. Hi, ma'am. Joy... this is marvelous. It doesn't even look like the same room. -I can show you the kitchen. -No! No, no, no. No. Let me savor it for a moment. It's radiant. Do you know, when I was small, I hated coming in this room. My uncle used to make me do my homework at this desk. If I gave him the wrong answer, he would smack my fingers with a wooden ruler. Terrifying man, when he wanted to be. I apologize you have to put up with these ghastly portraits of my most distinguished family. Grandfather. Great-grandfather and sons. No room for the women, of course. My mother, she actually saved their fortune with her own. But when her husband, my father, died, they cast her out. She became very ill after. Spent the rest of her days in a hospital. Fortunately, I did all right. I was my father's daughter, so that was that, I was fine. Didn't spare me their judgment. Alas, you can't choose your family, can you? -Anyway, let's see this-- -Wait! I'm so sorry about your mother, Ma'am Katherine. So sorry. So sorry. Oh. It's quite all right, dear. Thank you. Now, kitchen? Hello! Ma'am Katherine... I just wanted to say thank you again... for hiring me. The last year has been very difficult, and I just feel very honored and grateful for working for... such a household. We say that in the Philippines. It's a saying. Thank you again, ma'am. Uh... you're welcome. Grace! Grace? Get under the bed. No, I mean... Oh, don't... No, don't do that. Stay there! I would have loved dinner. I'm living on cheese sandwiches. Yes! New girl, Philippines. Everything stinks of coriander. Medicine time. Yes! All right, darling. Thank you so much. Shit! Right, open up. That's it. There we are. Joy! Joy, will you put the kettle on? I'm parched. Joy, what is that smell? -Oh, I'm making lunch. -Yes, but what is it? Chicken adobo. Chicken a-what? Adobo. Oh, no, no. No. Just a cheese sandwich for me, please. Simple foods, remember? I'm sorry, ma'am. And what are those? Oh, it's... it's for good luck, prosperity and health. The... The spoon and the fork... Yes, very lovely. Lovely. But do try to remember that this is your place of work, not your home, yes? Yes, ma'am. Do it later. It's fine, it's fine. -My sandwich. -Oh! Mommy! -Mommy, that lady gave... -Grace... Mommy, listen to me. Listen to me. You almost got me fired today. That lady gave that old man sleepy medicine. I heard her. She put it in his mouth and made him swallow it. -But, Mommy, it had an A on it. -Grace, that's enough, please. Just get ready for bed. What bed? You never listen to me. I hate you. I hate all of this. [pounding continuous I'll burn this house down! George, darling, don't quote the law to me. I was practically there when they wrote it. You are well aware that their request to witness my signature in person is not only inconvenient, it's bloody gratuitous. He's dying, George, yes. I'm not leaving here till... Wonderful. George, I'll call you back. Leave it, Joy. I'll do it. I said, I will do it! I'm sorry, ma'am. Don't you have something to do? Mommy, what are you doing? No. Mommy, I have to tell you something. think there's something wrong with Katherine. I know. She shouldn't be giving these to Mr. Garrett. - No! Last night, she-- - Joy! Were you on the phone? Phone... Yes. Who were you talking to? My sister. I'm very sorry. No, that's lovely. Just do try not to take personal calls on the job, yes? Come with me, please. I have to disappear for a few days, I'm afraid. While I'm away, it is of paramount importance that my uncle continue to receive his vital medication. I know you have been keen to help, so now is your shining moment. I'm aware my methods are somewhat unorthodox, but I enjoy what is practical and what gets the job done, yes? So, we prop him up like so... so he doesn't choke on it. And then we gently open his mouth and pop them inside, yes? Here we are. Go on, dear. That's it. Oh, come on, he doesn't bite. -I'm not sure this is how you-- -Oh, come on. Let go. Joy, let go. That's it. That's it. There we are. Good girl. That's it. There. Easy-peasy. I have prepared a daily pillbox. Don't worry about what's what. It's on the bedside table. Your only concern shall be the daily administration, which I now see you are more than capable of. Well done! Would you like to come and see me out? See you in a few days. You can reach me if need be, but I trust you have everything under control. If anything changes, you must contact me immediately. -Do you understand? -Yes, ma'am. Right, now... I know this is a bit early, but... here. We understand each other, yes? Yes, ma'am. Right. Oh! I'm sorry, ma'am. I'll see you Friday. Where are you going? But, Mommy, I have to tell you something. Oh, no. No, no, no, no! No, no... "I solemnly pledge myself before God and in the presence of this assembly. To pass my life in purity and to practice my profession faithfully. I will abstain from whatever is deleterious and mischievous, and will not take or knowingly administer any harmful drugs." Fuck. Grace? Mommy! Mommy... I saw Katherine sleepwalking last night, and I followed her into the storage room, and there was a dead woman inside a glass box. She picked up a knife and almost stabbed me with it, but she couldn't see me because she was sleepwalking. And she said that she wanted to burn the house down. - Mommy... - Grace, please. But I'm not playing a game. I saw her. Grace, anak. We are in a dangerous place now. Then let's go, Mommy. She's not here. Not yet. Mommy really needs your help right now. Open the drawer, please. What is this stuff? We used this back home when you were ill. The wrong dose can make you hallucinate, but the right one will purge your body of toxins. Are you ready? All right, Mr. Garrett. Now I need your help. That's it, Mr. Garrett. Okay, Grace. Get the bucket. Hurry up. All right, Mr. Garrett. Let's do this. All right, that's it. That's right. Glo... Glo... Gloria? Gloria? Glo... Gloria? Gloria? Mr. Garrett? Oh, Gloria. I've missed you. Oh, um, no, Mr. Garrett, I'm Joy. J... J-J-Joy? Whe... Where's Gloria? I don't know, but I'm your housekeeper. How long have I been... sleeping? Well, I don't know, but your niece, Katherine, hired me. She was looking after you before I came here. Wh... Who? -Your niece, Katherine. -No... No, I don't... I don't have a niece. No, I... I have no family left. - Um, that's okay. - No... I'm sure there's a good explanation. Um, I'll be right back. I'm gonna make you something to eat. No, please don't leave me. It's all right. I won't be long. No, please... Katherine... Hello? Who... Who's there? Who's there? Hmm? Are you an angel? Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, Mr. Garrett. -I can explain this. -Explain what? -This is my daughter... -Grace. I saw her in my dreams. She tells me you've been caring for me. Oh, that smells lovely. Is that for me? Tell me... who are you? Um... My name is Joy Espiritu, and I'm originally from the Philippines. I love the Philippines. You've been? I spent most of my childhood there. Aw, I want to go to the Philippines. You've never been? -That can't possibly be true. -Why haven't we been, Mommy? Uh... It's complicated. I think Mr. Garrett is tired. We should go. Come on, quickly. But I like talking to him, Mommy. He's still recovering. Oh! Oh, Good Lord! I see you're rather good at that. Good morning. I'm sorry. Whatever for? Anak, please. I asked you to leave him alone. -But... -It's okay. Grace, would you like to play in the garden? Can she play in the garden? Clever girl, that one. She's got her mother's eyes, too. Is there a father in the picture? Oh, I'm sorry. I'm just-- I'm so curious about you and Joy-- G-Grace. There... was a father. As in "no more"? - Oh, I'm sorry, my dear. - Oh, no. Grace doesn't know her father... because she thinks he's dead. Well... he deserves to be after what he did to me, but then I wouldn't have had Grace, so... I see. I wanted to know more about you because I believe I'm indebted to you, Joy. And this mad woman posing as my niece... seems intent on putting me out to pasture. I don't want to get anyone into trouble. I want to help you, Joy. -Help me? -I'd like to officially offer you the position as my full-time carer. And Grace can have her own bed, or room, if she likes. Would you like that? Well, of course. But wh--why are you doing this? I mean... thank you... so much. It's just... you don't even know us. I once had a Filipino nanny. Well, she was more than just a nanny. She was like a mother. More so than my own, actually. We brought her back here, and she helped to raise me. I feel connected to you people. And you've saved my life, and that's worth helping yours in any way I can. But... What's wrong? Um... -It's my visa... -We'll fix it. We can? We will. But first we have a little problem we have to solve. I'm gonna need your help. -Can I rely on you? -Yes, of course. Tell me about this impostor. Did you ever watch cockfighting back home? Oh, my father did, but it's too violent for me. Oh, I loved it. Gloria used to take me to the arenas to watch. Of course, my parents didn't know. They would have strung her up if they did. You know, they lead very pampered lives. Well-fed and watered. They can roam free and play. They're very obedient creatures, if you know how to train them. Yeah. They were very lucky outside the ring. Did you know that? But they die in the ring. Oh, nothing is wasted. If a chicken dies in a match, you can buy it and have it for your dinner that very night. - Did you? - Oh, no. A bit too barbaric. Oh! I'm sorry, Mr. Garrett. You're being too harsh on her. It's all right. They didn't belong to anyone important. Come. I've got a surprise for you. How would you like to have your own bedroom? What do you mean? Your mother's gonna come and work for me, and you can live here as long as you like. - I can have any bedroom? - Grace! Almost any, but on one condition. You call me your Lolo. Grandpa? Uh, okay. Thank you, Lolo Garrett. I'm so happy. You're my family now. Uh, Mr. Garrett, do you already have any...? Oh, uh, let's do away with "Mister." Oh. Lolo Garrett, -Do you have plans for--? -No, no. I prefer "Master." May I know your plans with Katherine... Master Garrett? Just leave it with me. Do you mind making us some tea? Do you drink tea? What do you like? Mm... Hot chocolate, please. Tea and a hot chocolate, please, Joy. Yes, Master Garrett. -What's so funny? -Nothing. -Here's your tea. -Yeah, just leave it there. I'll check in on you later in the night. I want to stay here with Lolo. All right, listen to your mother. - But I really-- - No, come on. We can play in the morning. Okay. Joy. I think she deserves to know. You would like to know your daddy, wouldn't you? But my dad's dead. That's not what your mommy told me. Oh, pet. Today's full of surprises. I'll see you both in the morning. Mommy? Let's go. Anak, there are so many children back home that would be happy to have this. Did you know your dad? Oh, yes, of course. Grace! You're a liar. "This is where I belong." Oh, Gloria. Grace. Joy, I'm back. My bags! Where is she? How many times do I have to...? Oh, God! It's cockroaches. God... Oh! God! Joy! Joy! Joy! No, you're probably right. Yeah, I'll check my jewelry. Well, she's done a runner. I don't know, back to the Philippines, probably. Yes! It stunk to high heaven. It's absolutely vile. Probably, I don't know. They're all starving over there, aren't they? Well, not in this house. Yes, the stove was left on. Could have burnt the whole house down. Oh, can you imagine? Nightmare! Well, the insurance would have been glorious, wouldn't it? Can you imagine? All right, darling. Yeah. Story for another day. I've got to get in the shower. I reek of gravy. Right, ciao! Oh, my... Oh, my God! Ah! Oh, my God. Oh, God. Oh... Ah! Hello? Hello! Yes, I would like to speak to the manager. That product has almost scalped me. My fucking hair is falling out! Yes, it did. I will not, for one more second... Joy? Oh, God. Why, how lovely to see you, pet. We've been enjoying some fresh air. Aren't you coming to greet your uncle? Uncle? What a lovely surprise. Joy... would you be so kind as to make us some tea? We'll take it in the drawing room. Yes, Master Garrett. You've been a bit of a rascal, haven't you? I don't believe I gave you permission... to change the carpet in the lobby. Just kidding. I don't actually like change, but I quite like the carpet. However, I am rather disappointed you put me into a chemically-induced coma. Quite, quite cunning. And very apt for you to do so... considering I am dying. But it does strike me as... rather illegal, don't you think? All those years of being a criminal barrister... you might have come up with something more exciting. Oh, pet, you look just like your mother. Don't stand there, Gloria. Get something to clean this! What's the matter with you? I've had you declared! You've done what? It was really quite difficult to convince the right people... but turns out you can do what you want if you have enough money. I've had you declared incompetent. Is that exciting enough for you, uncle? The entire estate belongs to me now. I guess everything does come full circle. Your mother would be so proud. My mother? What are you talking about? Darling niece, don't be upset. Think of the life her sacrifice gave you. Gave us. She rescued a trading company five generations deep. What are you talking about? A 500-year-old family legacy was about to end. Your mother's fortune was the lifeline we needed. As with any fortune, no one in their right mind would give it up easily, which is why we had to have her committed. And not without your help, of course. No. You told me she was sick. You told me that she needed special treatment! Yes. And the document you signed as to her mental deterioration gave her the help she needed. You tricked me. Well, actually... I asked you to carefully read it before signing. I was 11! May I ask how you're going to enjoy the estate when you'll be in prison? There are witnesses. Oh, I don't know about you, but I'm famished. Joy, would you? Eh, don't mind her. She used to sulk all the time. Let her be. Yeah. We'll soon find a way to be a family again. One big family. Yes. Yes. Go back to the order we had. When there was a hierarchy, where they knew their place. Mm! Joy, what do you think? Grace... get ready for bed, please. Shh. Please. I can disappear. I won't say anything, I swear. - I have a daughter. - Shut up. Turn around. Wh... Wh... What is this? Gloria, meet Joy. Joy, this is Gloria. I don't know what he's promised you... but this is your future if you don't leave this place. You should have just stuck to cleaning toilets... and wiping his ass. Isn't that what you people are good for? -I'll go. -Yes, you will. But before you do... All you have to do is keep your mouth shut. Easy. You're going to kill him. The cancer is doing that on its own. I'm just giving him a dreamy send-off. The cancer? Oh! You thought... You thought I was trying to murder my uncle? Although I probably will now. I can see why he took to you. You look like her. You sound like her. You know, I always felt quite sorry for Gloria, actually. She was so lonely. So obedient. Hmm. I just wish you had stuck up for yourself! Hmm? Even against me. She tried so hard to fill my mother's shoes, but... how could she, when everything was, "Yes, ma'am" this, "Yes, ma'am" that? It was pathetic. I sensed the same quality in you. That's why you were perfect for the job. -No. -I beg your pardon? You stole her life. You robbed her! We gave her a better life. She'd have been completely hopeless without our help. Help? What help? We prepare your meals... administer your medicine. We sing your kids to sleep. We walk your dogs. We take care of your parents. We pick up your shit. And when you're dying... we comfort you, until your last breath. We don't need your help. You need ours. Why? - Wait, what's going on? - We're not safe. Now, please, get dressed. No, I'm not going! What about Lolo Garrett? That lady's going to kill him. Don't call him that. That man is dangerous. He's a bad man. Now, please, I'm begging you, get dressed. No, he isn't. Grace, please. Okay? Please just pack your bags now. No! I'm not leaving. He cares about us, he loves us. Oh, Grace. Mr. Garrett doesn't love us. He wants to own us. That's different, okay? Shh. Stay here. Who do you think you are? You can't just barge in here. On what grounds do you...? An NTO was served to the owner of this house. -Are you Nigel Garrett? -No. Obviously I am not Nigel Garrett. We have a warrant to search on a report you are housing an illegal immigrant. You can either assist in this matter or be detained for obstruction of duty. -Joy Espiritu? -Yes? The Home Office have deemed you an immigrant offender of the UK. Mr. Garrett? Master Garrett? No! I was... I was already going! Why did you do this? She was going to kill him! She tried to kill him! Let me go! Anak! Grace! What have you done? Some people took her away. Hey, it's okay, it's okay. Shh. We'll get her back. Just relax. Just breathe. Just breathe. Now, we need to be very quiet, and there's something I need you to do for me, okay? I don't suppose we can talk about this. I'm afraid not. Playtime is over. Time to say good night, uncle. Ah! I think playtime's just begun. Oh... Wait! Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. No! Let me go! No, no... Hello, ma'am. Hi, ma'am. My goodness. That was extraordinary. What do you think she saw? Come on, pet. It's pretty ghastly here. Let's go to the kitchen. I want to get my mommy now. We'll do that tomorrow. How about a hot chocolate? How about a knickerbocker glory? Have you tried one of those before? No, I want to get my mommy. I think you're being a little unreasonable. Isn't this what you wanted? I distinctly recall you saying, "I wish she was gone." But I didn't mean that. Well, be careful what you wish for, pet. You called those people. I'm beginning to feel... you're being very ungrateful. -I want to go home. -You are home! Oh, God, you people. You don't know just how lucky you are. You're well-fed and watered. I said to Gloria, I said, "You have purpose here, you have freedom." But you put her in a glass box. I'm going to put you in a glass box... you ingrate. Ah! Grace... Lolo Garrett didn't mean that. He's very sorry. You're right. Let's get Mommy. Grace! Grace! Grace! Grace. Lolo Garrett just wants to talk. There's no need to hide now, darling. Grace. Grace. Aren't you tired of hiding, Grace? You don't have to do that anymore. Not here. I can give you what you want. Don't you want to belong? Gloria... Get off! You're not going anywhere! Get out! My sweet niece. Thank goodness. Get this wretched thing off me. Quickly! What are you doing? I'll see you in hell... uncle. Wake up! Come. Come on. Ah! I can't represent you in this case. And I can't give you any more advice on what to do from here on out. So, you definitely shouldn't call this number... and ask for Jonas Harrington. He certainly won't be interested in taking a pro-bono case for an individual who has been impregnated by a British citizen, which in some instances would give her the legal right to remain in said country. -Thank-- -Shh. For months, we prayed in fear of losing our home. And when the day came to give up our roots, we, as a community, came together to plant new ones. A moment of darkness led us to a place of light. Right. Are you ready? Hi. Can I help you? Hi. I'm Joy, and this is Grace... your husband's daughter.
