Now, listen up! Some of you know me as Billy on the Street. But on September 30th, I have a movie coming out called "Bros." "Bros" is making history as the first gay rom-com ever made by a major studio and the first where every role is played by an openly LGBTQ actor! Right? And I need you all there in theaters on September 30th because we need to show all the homophobes like Clarence Thomas and all the homophobes on the Supreme Court that we want gay love stories! And we support LGBTQ people! And we are not letting them drag us back into the last century because they are in the past, and "Bros" is the future! Are you with me, VMAs? And speaking of sinners, there are only a few voices in rock that can transport you to another place. All you sinners already know who we're talking about. That's right. They have defied genres, constantly reinvented and redefined their style. They don't just have albums. They have eras. VMAs, this is Panic! at the Disco! [Lyrics] Stare at a wall that's told a thousand tragedies Holding a hand that's loved every part of me A lady comes and tells me that I got to leave Right away, everybody is the enemy Deep breaths from the room where I watch you lie Any beat from your heart gets me through the night You're my love, you're my death, you're my alibi Say this isn't goodbye Who's gonna drive me home tonight Who's going to argue until they win the fight You're the only one that knows how to operate My heavy machinery Don't let the light go out Don't let the light go out Don't let the light go out Don't let the light go out A rush of blood floods hot thoughts in my head Red roses sitting silently beside the bed I'm saying more right now than I ever said Don't wanna live if the thought of loving you is dead Who's gonna drive me home tonight Who's going to argue until they win the fight You're the only one that knows how to operate My heavy machinery Who's gonna drive me home tonight Who's going to argue until they win the fight You're the only one that knows how to operate My heavy machinery Don't let the light go out Don't let the light go out Don't let the light go out Don't let the light go out Who's gonna drive me home tonight Who's going to argue until they win the fight You're the only one that knows how to operate My heavy machinery Who's gonna drive me home tonight Who's going to argue until they win the fight You're the only one that knows how to operate My heavy machinery Don't let the light go out Don't let the light go out Don't let the light go out Don't let the light go out [applause] - Please welcome back Avril Lavigne. - I love that I get to hand out the award for Best New Artist tonight because it's about to change somebody's life like it changed mine 20 years ago. And it's still one of my favorite memories. You've been all voting all night, so let's take one more look at the nominees. - Best New Artist. - The power was in your hands to name this year's best new artist, and you narrowed it down to three. Maneskin. Dove Cameron. And Seventeen. It all came down to your voice, your vote, and it's time to find out who's taking home the title. This is your Best New Artist presented by Extra Gum. - All right. And the VMA goes to... Dove Cameron. - [Lyrics] I could be a better boyfriend than him I could do the -- that he never did Up all night, I won't quit Thinking I'm gonna steal you from him I could be such a gentleman Plus, all my clothes would fit - Wow. Thank you so much. I'm so floored. I'm so moved. This is so wild to be up here with so many artists that I worship. These are some of my all-time favorite artists up here. I -- This year has been so wild, and I have no explanation for it except that I have you guys to thank. I know that. I want to dedicate this to all of the queer kids out there who don't feel that they can take up space and inhabit the fullness of who they are. Thank you for getting an overtly queer song onto mainstream radio. Thank you for supporting me as the person and the artist that I am. I hope that in that way you've also given that same privilege to yourselves. I love you so much. Thank you, MTV. Thank you, Columbia Records. Thank you guys. Thank you. Thank you. [Lyrics] I guess that flowers Aren't just used for big apologies I guess I should've been more conscious how you spoke to me Because when we'd fight, you give me space And not communicate And for a while, I thought that's what I should appreciate Maybe I was holding on to what I thought you were But when you think too hard, eventually, it starts to hurt The version of you in my head now I know wasn't true Young people fall for the wrong people, guess my one was you - The party continues!
