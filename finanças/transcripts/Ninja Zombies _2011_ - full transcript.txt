Another hot one outside today as this heat wave continues. Record highs today and all week so let's keep you cool on this morning commute with cool new music just released. It's hot new music on a very hot day on Hot 99.7. Good morning, Mr. Wigglesworth. Num, num, num, num, num, num, num. Uh, morning, Kara. In a rush? Yeah, well, you know, life is short. Really, really short. You never know, you might just not wake up tomorrow. Welp, gotta get to kendo class. Kara, wait. You forgot your, um, sword thing. Thanks, Dameon. Goodbye forever. JK. She is such a spazoid. Can you pick a victor or something. You can totally do that, right? She's not that bad. Try sharing a bathroom with her. I'm gonna walk in on her one of these days and find her slitting her wrists or something. Ew. Yeah, well, at least if she's got some blood on her, she'd be wearing some color. Yo, Lar-Dawg, where my pop-tart at? Catch. Dawg, you burned it. No, man. I heard you get more protein this way. Nice. Morning, boys. Got anything in there for me? Well, Trish, you can have my pop-tart. Uh, thanks, G. But how about you and Lar-Dawg just bring me an orange sherbet mochaccino later? Sure thing, Trish. Where you gonna be? Around campus. I'm gonna be working on my econ paper. Ow. I don't know nothing about econ. See you later, boys. I hate to see you go. But I love to watch you leave. Pffew! Yeah. Come on, guys. You're gonna get played like that? Shut up. We're gonna get laid like that, while you lie in your bed all alone listening to the bumps through the ceiling. Sorry. Just made me throw up in my mouth for a second. Don't cross swords. Yo, shut your face. Lameon. Come on, guys, think about it. You guys live downstairs, remember? Yeah, but the games are up here, dingbat. Aye, at last ye land lover. Luke! You're wearing a tunic. Knights wear tunics. Yar. So why are you talking like a pirate? Yeah, yeah, whatever. Come down to my car. I have something awesome to show you. Hold on a second. I want to get changed. At least one of us should look normal. Happy birthday, man. Whoa, man. These are awesome. What do we use 'em for? What won't we use 'em for? Plus, I think they'd be great to have in the show. Yeah, good idea. Well, and one of 'em's mine. Yeah, of course. Yes. Hope anyone didn't see us. Maybe we should put these away. Hey, wait, wait. Check this out. What? What is this? And where do you get these? At a tag sale. They had this there too. Whoa. This is so cool. I know, right? Let's put these away before the tenants think we're on a crusade. Speaking of which, Kara is an angel. Yeah, she's a good tenant and all but she can be kind of weird sometimes. Well, you do remember what happened to her brother, Tommy, right? Yeah. Watching your only brother be impaled by a mailbox, it just creates a lot of baggage. Well, she's still kind of cute, though. What part of "crazy" don't you understand? Mmm.. Pretty much all of it. Anyways, can we get on with the show? Hello, everyone. Okay, three, two. Hello, everyone, and welcome to another adventure in "This Week in Geek." And we're your hosts, Luke the Duke. And I'm DK. Last week, we discussed the concept for our next comic book. And it's totally gonna be space zombies. Wait, well, hold on a second. Wait. We're not gonna do zombies anymore? Well, no, hear me out. I know what this is. You hate zombies, don't you? Yeah, I mean, they kind of drive me insane but... I'm pretty sure you need to hand over your geek card right now. All they ever do is mope around and moan at you. What kind of geek are you? One that hates zombies, apparently. What's next? Are you gonna tell me that Greedo shot first? You fought well. Now, die with honor. Ow! Ow. As honorable as you think. Wow, you guys are idiots. Oh, uh, hey, guys. Dude, come on. That was straight-up bullshit. There's no way in hell he made that pass. Well, maybe you should stop sucking. Maybe you should stop sucking your mother's dong. Hey, man. No, ow, ow. Please don't procreate. Guys, you gonna pay rent this month or what? Who do you think you are, the landlord? No. Then shut up. Hey, Dameon, I'll have it to you by tomorrow. I've got to pick up some product. What? Still selling pills to 16-year-old kids? Yo, what up? Yeah, yo, what up? You got some ecs? Where you going to, like, a rave or something with your Mickey Mouse gloves. You know it, dog. Yeah, girl, we can hook you up. $20 a pill. Give me two. Just be aware, ecs is a gateway drug... ...to getting laid. Yeah. Oh, easy money. Yeah, these kids are so dumb, they can't tell the difference between ecstasy and baby aspirin, man. We're keeping these kids off drugs. Yo, it's like we're the anti-drug superhero. This is some straight-up Robin Hood shit, man. Uh, hey, uh, this came for you. Happy birthday. It's not from us. Yeah, Lar-Dawg, let's ditch these losers and go get Trish that frappe what's-it. Yeah. Man, forget about those douche bags. What's in the package? "Dearest Dameon. If you are reading this, then it is your 25th birthday. Happy birthday. It also means that we are all dead. Sad. You must work extra hard now because of the secret responsibility that you inherit. This key is for the trunk in the basement. Make us proud. Love, Mum, Dad and Albert." Dude, didn't your family die in a series of completely unrelated freak accidents? How'd they all know they died? Dude, will you shut up for a minute? Well, here's the key. You wanna go open up the trunk? Oh, man. It smells like ass. When was the last time you came down here? Not since I inherited the place. Hey, over there. So, you want to open it? Is that it? Lame. It looks like 16th century. That is so cool you know that. Can I touch it? Yeah, it is kind of cool. Hey, be careful. It's, like, really old and stuff. Are you gonna whip it out or what? That's what she said. Pffew! No, not yet. This is, like, a lot of stuff to deal with right now. I need to figure out what it all means. Maybe there's an explanation in that scrolly-looking book thingy. What's it say? I don't know. I can't understand Japanese. I do. - Really? - You do? I'm taking the fourth year advanced class but it's not like I ever use it. Yeah, right, you spend all day watching those weird-ass googly-eyed cartoons. Yo, I didn't know girls could be nerds too. Hey! She can still get it. Watch it, ass-wipe. I'm just saying. I kind of dig that vampire shit. Bet she's a freak in the bed, y'all. My throat ain't the only thing she can suck. Ugh, what the frack, guys. Yeah, shut the frack up. Did you just say "frack"? I wouldn't touch you with a 10-foot buster sword. Bust-your-nut sword. Real classy, guys. Aw, come on. You know you want a piece of the Lar-Dawg, baby. I told you to shut up, Larry. Oh, what you gonna do about it, little man? I'll think of something. - Oh, yeah? - Yeah. Hey, just chill out, guys. Yo, dawg, he ain't worth it. Let's go shot gun some beers. Sounds good, bro. Wouldn't want this dork to get any of his dork blood on me. I'd be infected. Kara, are you okay? Can I, like, come in or something? Yeah, it's open. Hey. Don't let them get to you. What makes them think they can talk to me like I'm some kind of sl... I know. They're meatheads. Just don't let them bother you. So why do you hang out with them anyway? Like, I don't know, they're fun and predictable and, when it comes down to it, they're harmless. They're all talk. Yeah, but they completely objectify you and say gross things. I mean, doesn't it make you want to cut their tongue out with a rusty steak-knife? Ew, no. Look, there's nothing wrong with embracing your sexuality. It's empowering. Well, guess that works out for you. It does. So why are you being so nice to me? Well, most of the time, I don't know why you're always freaking out but this time I did. Hey, guys. Is, um, everything okay? Yeah. You're actually really pretty. When your face isn't covered in that crap. Let's just agree to disagree. Mmm. So what do you think that is? Samurai skills for dummies? More like the truth behind my family's death. I'm sorry, I'm such an asshole. Here, I'll do it tonight. Tommy, I wish you could be here. This is, like, for real feudal Japanese stuff. Wait a minute. Holy crap! Aghh! Ahh What the hell was that? Aghh! Hey, Kara? Is everything okay in there? I couldn't help but notice the extreme fear and panic in your eyes. Kara? Yo, it's open. Didn't Kara just get home? Uh yeah, so? Isn't everybody home already? How the hell am I supposed to know all that? Yo, it sounds like somebody's getting it on right now. As if anybody gets laid in this house besides us. Pfft. Yo, what the F? I said, "Blitz." You know what a blitz is, right? Yeah, yeah, I know what... Oh, G. G. Those boys are like children. All four of them. Who the hell is that? Yeah, die, you son of a bitch. I can't believe that bastard bit me. Ugh, man. Dude, what the hell? Who is this guy? I don't know. He just flew in here and jumped at G. Yeah, he bit me like some type of crackhead. Dude, what...? It was right here. What do you expect me to do? Man, I hope he didn't give me rabies or something. Aghh! That's hot. Hey! Be careful. This is like a... - You okay, man? - Did you hear that? - Hear what? - You didn't hear it? That's the last time I buy anything online. - That's my... - Kara, do you know him? Who killed my brother, again? That piece of shit's your brother? Get outta my way. Kara! What was that? Trish. No, no. Who are you? Trish! You've got to be kidding. Did you see that? A zombie? That's not a zombie. That's a ninja zombie. Trish! Ow! What the frack, dude? Where'd you learn how to do that? I don't know. You guys, seriously, what the F. Zombies? Where do you think they all came from? A virus? Meteorite? Some sort of chemical? Dameon, listen to me. You hold my sword. Did you find my spirit? Uh, What was that? Nothing. Never mind. Hey, Trish, you okay? No. Look at my room. The Hell Sword has been released. You have to find me. What was that? You guys hear that? - Huh? - What? What? Where am I? Who are you? I'm your ancestor, Akechi Tenshu. But how do you know English? I'm not speaking English, you son of a discount Kage. Your mind is hearing me in English. Okay, Gramps. Say I believe you. Can you tell me what the hell is going on? I'll show you. It all began when I stole the Hell Sword from Oda Nobunaga. Since then, it's been our family's mission to safeguard the secret of the Hell Sword from those ninja who still seek it. Each generation, the eldest child is trained to take over this responsibility at age 25. Your brother died before he ever reached that age. The Kage ninja hunted him down as they have done to so many of our kin. The ninjas wasted no time in attacking your parents next. Your parents fought with honor. No! The ninjas did not. Now the even greater responsibility falls upon you. The sword has been reawakened. You have to seal it away. But why didn't they tell me? Your brother was supposed to inherit this duty. They hoped you'd never have to bear this burden. But how am I supposed to... Use my sword. I was 25 when I channeled my soul into it. Now that you're the same age, you can fight with my skill but only with this sword. The Hell Sword brings the dead back until you train the impules. To complete their life's last mission... and to devour living flesh. Though the Kage Ninja have all been killed, the Jigoku no Ken has brought them back. They do not feel pain. They do not tire and they will not stop hunting the sword until they bring their master Nobunaga back to life. You can't dump this all on me and expect me to take care of it. You have to. If you don't, life as you know it will come to an end. Dameon. Hey, Dameon. I'm awake, I'm awake. Stop shaking me. Sorry, man. You gave us a scare back there. I just got lightheaded for a little bit. Yeah. Let me help you up. C'mon. What happened? Is everyone okay? Well, Kara, she hasn't really said anything. And Trish, well, she's pretty shaken up. Her shoulder... Would you look at my vest. Ah, right. Where's Tommy's body? I tossed that shit out the window. Hey, man, we need to figure out what to do here. If these things are zombies... Yo. If these things are zombies, does that mean that G.'s infected? I don't know if it's contagious but everything we need to know should be in the journal. It holds the secret behind this mystical legendary sword. It's called the "Jigoku no Ken." Aghhh! Okay. I think the coast is clear. The sword's under the bed. Oh, wow. Is that an original 1988 AKIRA promotional poster from Japan? No. It's in Spanish. Oh. But, I wish. Dameon! Dameon! Dameon! What? It's not, like, the first time I've played with a sword. Ow, it's hot. You fool. You're the only one who can fight with my sword. I think this thing has a real attitude problem. You know, if this all happened in the anime, I'd think it was really cool. I'm pretty sure this has happened in anime. True. Just add blue hair and tentacles. Okay, screw this. We got to get you out of here, G. Yeah, I'm down with that. C'mon, Trish, we're ditching these losers. It's about time. Let's take my car. But don't, like, bleed on my seats. What the...? G., yo, G. - Close the door, Lar-Dawg. - A little help. - I ain't getting bit again. - Go grab the gun, asshole. Do something. It's strong. What the hell. Holy shit. Yeah, you better run, Hanzo. Is that a "Kill Bill" reference? Well, that or "Samurai Shodown" or... Did I ever tell you you're the coolest chick I know? Dude, what the hell do you have a gun for? Protection, yo. From who, Tupac? Like the seventh graders are gonna pop you if they don't get their Nyquil? It came in handy, didn't it? Not with you using it. You got to shoot 'em in the head, bro. Let me see that. Ammo's in the side drawer, Dawg. G., you don't look that good. Yeah, I think I need to see a doctor. Are we getting out of here soon? Um, hold on. Can we just talk about how that thing just spoke, like, with words and then just vanished into thin air? Not your run-of-the-mill zombies. They seem intelligent. Smart, fast and the living dead? Great. We're so gonna die. Okay, Kara. You, like, seriously need to stop speaking. Yo, dude. Dude. Maybe we should get him some help. I think it's too late. I'll miss you, bro. I'm so sorry, dude. I didn't mean to. I didn't mean... you're my best friend. You Are my best friend. Dameon, listen to me. No! No, what? This isn't real. This can't be real. This is all some twisted elaborate dream. Hey, man. Calm down. No, I don't have to calm down. I can freak out if I want to. And guess what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna freak out. Dameon. La-la-la-la-la-la. Here, take this shit. Aghh. What? I don't want to get burned. You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go to bed because that's where I probably am, in reality anyways. Yes, that's what I'm gonna do. I'm going to bed. We're screwed. Hey, Lar-Dawg? You leave me the hell alone right now. Gimme the sword! Gimme the sword! Agh he's behind me! You felt that a little bit, you son of a bitch. Hey, man. I'm sorry, but this shit just got real. Yeah. Can we, like, get the hell out of here? These things keep coming. Maybe we should hole up here. There's probably more of them out there. And they're really hard to see in the night. 'Cause they're ninjas. Well, yeah. Who put you dorks in charge all of a sudden? You're gonna get us killed. You mean, between my encyclopedic knowledge of the undead and Dameon's new-found sword bad-assery? Okay, fine. Yo, if we're staying here, I'm gonna set up watch. I'll go first. Dork number 1, you take over after me. Dork number 2, get your head out your ass and then take over for him when he's done. A few hours ago, I'm just a normal person. And now I find out my family are murdered by ninjas and I'm supposed to save this world from some zombie apocalypse? Hey, wait. What? How do you know all this? Why don't you ask Kara? Yeah, Kara, what's up with that freaky Dark Sword? Why did Mr. Undead Ninja bug out after seeing it? I... I just miss my brother so much. I was going all crazy. And you thought you'd found a way to bring him back? I translated this journal, and it was all about this spooky sword called the Jigoku no Ken. According to the legend, it had the power to raise the dead. Some ultra-baddie war lord, Oda Nobunaga, got his hands on it during the 1500s. He used it to conquer most of Japan. His trusted general, Akechi Mitsuhide, disapproved of his use of the sword and betrayed him, forcing him to commit seppuku. Mitsuhide then gave the sword to Akechi Tenshu, your ancestor, to keep it safe. He took it as far away from Japan as possible and that's how the sword ended up here. Nobunaga's elite assassins, the Koga ninja, wanted the Hell Sword to bring their master back and came after Tenshu. One of them, your ancestor, Yuriko, was in love with Tenshu and helped him perform the ritual to hide the sword and seal away its magic. Wait, Dameon, your ancestor was a samurai? I thought you were Korean. Half. My father's Korean. My mother's Japanese/Chinese. I'm kind of pan North East Asian. Well, that explains that. Now, Kara. You went and found the sword, the Jiggy Haroken, to bring your dead brother back to life? I know it was wrong but I had to try. I didn't think it would end up like... You mean, you knew it could be dangerous and you didn't care. Do you have any idea what it's like to see a loved one in a dream and wake up just to realize they're not there? Or to get really excited to tell someone something and then all of a sudden remember that you just can't? Yes. I do. Well, now so does Lar-Dawg. Let's make sure he doesn't find out about any of this. Or else he's gonna go ape shit on us. He can just do it. I deserve it. Hey, don't say that. What's done is done. And killing each other, that's not gonna solve anything. What you whispering about out here? It's not creatine or blasting or pecs. So trust me, you wouldn't care. Watch it, geek squad. I know we have to seal it away. Can we do that? Kara, where'd you find it? Graymalkin Cemetery. It's only a few blocks from here. Then that's where we'll head in the morning. Why is this happening to me? I just finished my econ paper. It was good. I was gonna turn it in tomorrow. Don't worry, Trish. You'll turn it in. Dameon. There's more you need to know. Yeah, tell me about it. Why did Kara raise the Kage ninja along with her dead brother? Only a master of the Jigoku no Ken could raise a specific body. Any unfocused use of the sword's energy could accidentally raise random bodies in the area. And the Kage ninja were in the area. So was their leader, Shogun, Nobunaga's best assassin. He mortally wounded me when he came after the sword. Daddy! Daddy! His fight is ruthless and one of the best I have ever seen. Go! Feast! Spread our curse and amidst the chaos, we will find the Jigoku no Ken. Hey, Kara. Couldn't sleep? No. I'll get plenty of sleep when I'm dead. There's that charm we all love. So, big into anime. Like, an otaku, right? Clearly, I'm no cooler for knowing this word. So you're Japanese then? Nepali, actually. The anime thing? I don't know. I guess in school, they never really taught us much about Nepal and, well, my parents tried, but, it was just hard to feel connected. Yeah. All I really know is that they have those really tall mountains out there. Yeah. My brother was adopted too, but from Vietnam. Well, I guess anime was the only remotely Asian thing that was accessible; so we sort of made it our thing. We bonded over it. It didn't matter that we got made fun of, because we had each other. That probably doesn't make any sense. No. No, it does. This may surprise you but, I still get made fun of quite a bit. Well. I better get some rest. Great. I'll guard you... everyone, I mean. I'll stand guard... watch. Yeah. I'll stand watch. Idiot. Sorry, Luke. Doh! Ugh. Agh! Dude, what the hell? Ugh. You're supposed to be taking watch. I didn't get the license plate on that truck. Hey, wait. Where's Kara? Where's the sword? Oh no, she went by herself. She's taking the sword to the cemetery. We got to help her. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Why do we have to help her? Are you serious? Yes, I'm serious. She's the one who stole this thing in the first place. It's her fault that all this happened. It doesn't matter. She can't do this on her own. She's gonna get killed. She took you down, didn't she? Dude, you're the zombie killer. You have the power to stop all this. For all I know, this thing could just shut itself off at any time. Look, man, I'm going after her. Are you coming? I'm not the one trying to get in her pants, man. You can go by yourself. Wow. Really? All right, man. Nice knowing you. Holy shitty tits. I can't believe you didn't go out with him. I mean, that was low. He's supposed to be your best friend and you just left him there to die? He just wants to impress a girl. He's your friend and that's all that matters. If that was G. Out there, I'd be with him. You're an asshole. Here's a twist. We actually made it to morning so can we please get the hell out of here? I'm with you, Trish. There's my car. Yeah. My car! Trish, don't... Trish! Shit! Trish. Trish, no! Lar-Dawg you okay? Do you see? Yeah, Gramps. I see. Where are you going? You were right, Larry. I'm going to help Luke. Yo I'm getting these assholes too. You're gonna get killed. The way I see it, I'm already dead. But I'm gonna go out swinging. All right. Let's go. Gimme a minute. Okay, take that. Ha-ha-ha-ha. Ha-ha-ha-ha. Hey, hey, c'mon in, c'mon, get behind me. Get behind me. Thanks, man. I... holy crap. Are you Lloyd Kaufman? Yeah, yeah. You know, I've been telling these bozoes all over town for years this would happen. I tried to warn 'em. Agh, you bastard, don't you come in. Lloyd, sir, what are you doing here? Listen to me, kid. We've got to get as far away from here as possible. I can't. I got to go to Graymalkin Cemetery. Graymalkin Cemetery? That's ground zero. I know. But, I have to help my friend. Oh. Oh, a girl? I mean, a gyno. We don't say "girls." It's politically incorrect. Gyno American. Is she a gyno American? - Yeah. - Yeah. She hot? Yeah, a little. She's got that whole Goth thing going on. Oh, oh, oh, oh. Ha, ha. Yeah. Get outta here, you bastard. Die, you savage bastard. Oh! Here, help me out. Take a few shots. Now, take it easy with that thing. Go ahead, shoot. Hurry up, hurry. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Ha, ha. You suck at shooting, let me tell you. Here, let me get... there, see? Do you see? Aim, you look... get the sights. Use the sight. Now, how are you who can't shoot for shit, how are you supposed to save that gyno? How are you gonna save your gyno friend? I don't know. My best friend, he was supposed to help me but, he chickened out. Chickened out? Chickened out, that... you mean, he turned into a chicken zombie? - No, no. - No, no, no. No, no, no, no. No. He was too scared to come help me. Well, kind of seems reasonable. I mean, this is some scary shit, man. I know, but I've always been there for him and... You know, fear is overpowering, young man. If your buddy has a habit of giving in to it, he's gonna need your help. Well, maybe. You've got to ask yourself, did he abandon you or did you abandon him? But he refused to help me. Look, help him face his fear and your friend will follow you to hell and back. Okay, ha, ha, ha. Here we go. Okay. How'd you like that, huh? Ohh! He said some pretty messed up things. Good friends always forgive each other. That's what life's all about. That's called sensitivity. Agh, you bastards. I'll blow your balls off. Yeah. I should have time to go back for him. Yeah, yeah. You do that. You go. Go catch him, go save the gyno and be a hero. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll hold them off. Oh, yeah, out of ammo, again. Ah-hah! Okay, Guadalcanal, ha, ha, ha, Vietnam, ha, ha, Oliver Stone. Yeah, yeah, you. Turn around and bend over, you zombie douche bags. Yeah. Hey, hey, what are you doing to me? Let's take a short cut. Isn't that just asking for trouble? What do you think this is? C'mon. Well, shit. At least we didn't get dressed up for nothing. Let's go. That was... that was freakin' awesome. Thank you. Yo, ass-wipe. Lose your virginity later. Sorry, excuse me a second. What's the matter, Larry? Can't keep up? What? I just took one down. Is that all? Two, three. Oh, no, you didn't. Hey, wait! I'm Melody. Um, I'm... I just wanted to thank you. Oh, it was nothing. Really. I was gonna kill it anyways. What the hell are you doing? I think I should go now. Here, let me see your phone. You got to be shittin' me? See, look. We can bump. Oh, sick. That's what that does? Hey, you want to, oh, I dunno, focus for two minutes? And now we're tied. Doesn't count. Yo, she turned. Damn, down to two rounds. Hey, so... Come on. Guess I'll be seeing you. World doesn't end, I'll call you. Was about to use one of them two on you. That's what I got for taking the shortcut. Woo-hoo! Dude, that was, like, 15 feet. I think I could really get used to this whole superhero thing. Oh, so you're a superhero now? Would you look at that. Dameon's all growns up. Yeah, and I can't wait to show Luke all the ass I can kick and all the numbers that I got. He's gonna be so jealous. Numbers? Oh, boy, count 'em. You got one. For now. No. - No. - Hey, man. We should keep moving. I mean, Kara might be out there. It can't end like this. I was such an ass. I should have went with him. It's all right, man. You thought you were losing your best friend to a girl. I get it. I mean, if G. Were around... Kill it! - Did I get him? - Luke. You're still alive. Oh, barely. Did we win? You okay? I'm sorry. Dude, it's cool. Sorry, I shouldn't have put you on the spot like that. No, man. I should have went with you. Will you two just kiss and make up already? We got more problems. Well Dameon, still too scared to use that sword? Hell, no. These powers are bad-ass. Watch. Kara. Go find Kara, Luke. - But... - Go! We can handle this one. Oh! Hey! Get your damn hands off her. Arghh! Kara, look out. Go kill some mother f-ing zombies. I got to get rid of this sword. Hey! Oomph. Kara, do the ritual. We'll hold them off. You undead bastard. Sorry, I can't help you losers anymore. No! Don't be distracted. Just be done with the ritual. It must end now! To seal away the sword's magic, a sacrifice must be made. Wait, what? We raised Nobunaga and if he gets the sword, everyone will die, this whole world. Well, then, I guess I'll just stop him too. We got to get the sword back. Agh! The girl must perform the ritual. She must die. And if you can't do it, I'll take your body and do it for you. It's not your duty anymore. This is my world. Not my duty? I gave my life, my soul, everything, for this. It cannot be for nothing. It wasn't. My world exists because of you. But I will not let any more of my friends die. If I can't save them, I can't save anyone. Go where your duty calls. I'll take it from here. No. What did you do? You're free. You fool. This burden will consume you. There's no escaping it. It's my responsibility now. I accept that. Only if you survive. Wake up! Luke! Dameon! Papa? Albert? Halt! Thanks guys. Let me help you one last time. Father! Thanks, Gramps. Gramps? We did it. We won. Right? For now. But we can't complete the ritual. We what? Turns out there's something about human sacrifice in the fine print. I guess I missed that. But the ninjas zombies they're dead, right? Well, dead dead? Just mostly dead? And the Hell Sword, it's safe with us now. No. Nobunaga's out there somewhere. Shogun released him. Shit. Luke, your arm. I'm all right. Whoa! You got to stop doing that, man. I just have to catch my breath. Without the ritual, the zombie curse could spread out of control. I better get moving. And I'm coming with you. No, Luke, you don't have to. Of course I'm coming.
