Raise your veil (illusion), you'll find your beloved The Lord resides in every living creature Don't speak ill of anyone, you'll find your beloved Raise your veil, you'll find your beloved Flaunt not this wealth and your youth All this is worthless, you'll find your beloved Raise your veil, you'll find your beloved ln the silent temple... When lighting a lamp in the silent temple... don't think of anything else You'll find your beloved Raise your veil, you'll find your beloved When my footsteps never hesitated to enter a courtesan's house... why do they halt when l enter a temple? Anyone who sees me will definitely wonder... what an atheist is doing here. Who? Mr. Vijay? Why are you here? l just came. Oh, soul, you're an atheist, but such a sinner. People feel spiritual on hearing her devotional songs... but you look at her with lustful eyes. Aunt! Aunt, did you say something? Aunt! Vijay, what l was saying was... this small house is the legacy of our forefathers. How much money will you get by selling this? And if you don't sell this, then perhaps you'll... have an excuse to visit once in a while. Okay, Aunt. lf you're upset, then l'll not sell it. Tomorrow or the day after, l'll return to Bombay. Aunt, take the milk. Mangu, bring it inside. Bring it inside. Give it to me. Look here, Mangu. Bring the milk earlier from tomorrow. Vijay asks for tea as soon as he wakes up. Okay? Aunt, what can l do? l have to do so many things. Early morning l've to warm the milk for the female mendicant. That's why l get delayed. No, Mangu. You must not trouble yourself so much. Look here. From tomorrow, l'll wake up late... and have my tea late, too. Okay? So should l sit at home for you all day? Shouldn't l go to the temple? Aunt, the Gods and Goddesses... wait for their devotees all day. Those poor souls don't even sleep. Look here, sir. Don't make fun of the Gods and Goddesses. Hey! Okay, Aunt, l'm going. He's an atheist. He'd understand only if he'd... have attended some religious discourses. Oh, the one with the flute... Viju, look here. Come home in time for your lunch. Aunt, are you going to arrange someone's alliance? No, l've stopped doing all this. l'll go to the temple to hear the religious discourse. Does the mendicant really narrate well? l told you. As it is you're an atheist. How are you concerned about the religious discourses? Aunt, l'm not as staunch an atheist as you think. lf l come across a real sage, l'll definitely change. Really? Then, tonight, do come and... listen to Meera Devi's devotional song. And from childhood... Meera considered Giridhar Gopal her husband... and always sang: l want to go to Giridhar's house Giridhar is my only beloved His beauty is enchanting l want to go to Giridhar's house Our love is eternal l can't stay without him Whatever he gives me, that attire l wear Whatever he gives me, l eat l want to go to Giridhar's house l'll sit wherever he seats me l leave myself to his will Giridhar is Meera's Lord l can bestow my life on him l'll go to Giridhar's house Gangu's mother, please wait. - Mangu! - Coming! Mother! - Devi! - You seem to be a stranger. No. l was born in this village. No man is allowed to come for the afternoon discourse. l didn't know that. Then why have you come? To listen to the discourse? No. To talk to you. l don't talk to men. lt's possible, but... What do you wish to know? The reason you became a mendicant at this age? Reason? l found the world too simple. Forgive me, but l can't believe that you left... worldly pleasures on the sages' advice. Why don't you believe it? The pain that's hidden in your eyes. Devi! Devi, forgive me that l've... Today, you've committed a mistake. Don't do it again. Mangu! Man... - Will you do one thing? - Sure. Go and call the guard. Order me, l'll myself... l want to call the guard to throw you out. What's my mistake? You're violating the rules here. ls it a crime to sit under a tree? Why do you... why do you... l'll be obliged if you leave here. l'll play the ball with Kanha, with Krishna With Yashoda's dark son My mother shouts if l play in the courtyard My brother pouts if l play in the alleys On Jamuna's banks, Kanhaiya will steal this Who will l play ball with, tell me? Ah, l'll play with Radha Uncle, you and here? Mangu, when l was small l used to play here, too. - Really? - Yes. - Then play. Mangu, you wear those saffron clothes, too. Do you wish to become a mendicant, too? No. These clothes are Meera Devi's. Uncle, have you heard Devi's songs? She sings well, very sweet. lf you wish, l'll hear her sometime. Why sometime? Come today. Today. - Okay. - Okay. Uncle, give me back my doll! Here. l'm crazy in love. No one knows my pain l sleep on a bed of thorns l've sleepless nights My beloved dwells in the sky How can we unite? No one knows my pain l'm crazy in love. No one knows my pain Only one who's wounded can know the pain No one else can understand it Meera's pain will ebb when she unites with her Lord No one knows my pain l'm crazy in love. No one knows my pain l would be obliged if you stop coming here. The entire village comes to hear your devotional songs. But l get disturbed on seeing you here. Today, for the first time, l looked up while singing. lf my coming here troubles you, then l won't come. How many days will you stay in the village? l was to return in a day or two. But after l saw you... After listening to your devotional songs... l decided to stay on a few more days. Then why don't you sit with all the others? Why do you hide? The entire village knows that l'm an atheist. Then you come here to listen to music? No. To see you. Don't come from tomorrow. ls this your order? No. Just a request. Can't you see? At every step you're breaking my rules. The rule of not talking to men. l didn't mean to break your rules or shatter your peace. Will you mind if l do something for my peace of mind... - without coming before you? - No! You cannot have forgotten Anjani. Or that evening when l... took you to her house for the first time. Hesitantly, the way you entered her house... Why do you lock eyes with me? Oh, stranger, oh, beloved... why do you lock eyes with me? Our eyes met and my heart was wounded Who was the culprit and who was slain? The ones who loved you were in a terrible state Living wasn't easy but death was difficult, too Oh, stranger, oh, beloved Why do you lock eyes with me? l have fallen prey to your charm Calming my heart though l'm restless Eyes cast down, l wait expectantly Helpless, l sit before you Oh, stranger, oh, beloved Why do you lock eyes with me? lf you've resided in my heart, then be my love Like eternal spring in a garden Be my peace and my happiness Be a beautiful remembrance of our love Oh, stranger, oh, beloved Why do you lock eyes with me? Lovely! Come on, get up, my dear. Why did l have to cage a free bird? - Raj, that's not it. - Then what is it? Anjani has stopped festivities at night... and you, you mope every night. Look here, Raj. A man and woman... don't always have the relationship that people assume. Sometimes, it's just a lingering attraction. Whatever you say, my friend... But when Anjani sings... she's restless at night, then she means what we're thinking. What does he know... of the plight of one who has lost her sleep? Why there are always tears in my eyes? Why is my life so disturbed? Why are my quivering lips silent? Why is my heart's desire so suppressed? He always comes and troubles me What does he know of the state of my heart? What does he know of the plight of the one... who has lost her sleep? Those whose days pass peacefully... and can sleep peacefully at night A heart wounded by love... What does he know of the plight of a wounded heart? What does he know of the plight of the one... who has lost her sleep? Great! Everything happens in reverse here. Vijay should be offering flowers at your feet. He is my lord. l am his devotee. Great! Nicely said. So the lord comes to your house to be worshipped? And that too in such a place where great sages have failed. Greetings, Gurudev! Greetings, Maharaj! Mr. Vijay, won't you greet him? The Lord never bows before anyone. Hello, Lord. Forgive me, sage, but people call me an atheist. So, then l, too, am an atheist like you. l, too, am in search of the Lord. ln the hearts of the poor... in the huts of the hopeless... and in the hearts of such helpless women. So, now we know the reason for you coming here. My son, some come here attracted by desire and lust. He comes, he degrades himself... and becomes worse than a devil. But some come here and become God... and are worshipped. Are you mocking me too? No, great one. Look here, sage; l am neither a great man nor God. Our Vijay is an aesthete. Mr. Vijay, you are a great soul. You have thought that God does not exist. But what is God? Truth, mind and happiness. This is how you identify God. You see God everywhere and in every form. You don't even visit the temple... yet you come here to my mother to see the Lord Gurudev, you taught me to not be a prostitute. But when my mother forced me, l was quite fortunate... that Mr. Vijay stopped me from doing that. Oh, noble man; your soul is in search of someone. You say that you're an atheist... but one day you'll be the one who will find God. One day the Lord will reside in your heart. Greetings, Gurudev! Hail, Satchitanand! Om, Lord, give me peace. - Sir! - Mangu... you've come so early in the morning to wash clothes? Yes, they'd piled up for the last two days. So, l'm washing them today. Meera Devi is sick. Meera Devi is sick? That's why l haven't seen her for two days. Yes. She's down with a fever. Mangu... how do you look after her? What can l do? As she's sick, l wash her clothes. l warm her milk. l listen to her speak... and keep looking at her face. What does she talk to you about? She says, Mangu, do not ever dream. l ask her why? So, she says dreams are fake. People who dream are often disappointed. And sir? l see dreams everyday. What should l do? - Give, l'll wring it out for you. No, sir! You cannot touch a mendicant's clothes. The doors to my heart have opened But my beloved has still not arrived Has still not arrived Aunt, is there any doctor or physician in the village? Viju, what happened? Do you have a headache? Do you have a stomach ache? A fever? Yes, l have a fever. Viju, all night you were wandering outside. Sleep on the bed. l'll immediately call the doctor. Okay? - Aunt, l don't have a fever. - Then? - Meera Devi has a fever! - That mendicant? l'll immediately go and call the physician. But Viju, how did you come to know? Mangu was telling me. Devi, now l have become very sensible. Father has told me clearly. Oh, Lord Krishna, please come to our country. Devi, this morning when l went to wash your clothes, l met sir there. l told him that Devi has a high fever. He asked me who looks after you. l told him l look after you. Me! Who else will? l warm her clothes. No, no, l wash her clothes. l warm the milk. l listen to her speak and... - Devi, are you listening to me? - Yes. Oh, Lord Krishna, please come to our country. Devi, you never listen to me. l'm going. Father, Devi still has a fever... and doesn't take her medicine. Then how will her fever ebb? Now who will make her understand? l keep telling all the children that l look after Devi. Father, you, too, are very stubborn. Many times l have forbidden you, but whenever l look... you're smoking this hookah. How did she know l was here? You? At this time? l always come here at night... to listen to your devotional songs. Why do you put these flowers on my doorstep? Why are you carrying them with you? l've brought them to immerse in the river. What if someone sees these rose petals on my doorstep? Not you perhaps, but your flowers will disturb my peace. ls that why you keep chanting the mantra, for your peace of mind? When, despite years of austerity, my mind is disturbed... l chant the peace mantra. Devi... can you forget everything just by meditating? Everything. Even God. But only if you do penance... with great concentration of the mind and the heart... You have really controlled your heart. You didn't come before me for three days. Wasn't that what you wished? lf you wish, you can come to the temple. May l ask you something? l'm talking to you like this and at this hour. What if someone sees us? Are you scared of people? Not of people, but of you. l don't know why, but l feel like talking to you again and again. l lose my peace of mind. ls it a sin if two people talk? Our conversations aren't related to the religious scriptures. Doesn't humanity allow sympathizing with anyone? The one who renounces the world doesn't need... compassion or sympathy. Joys and sorrow depend on our Karma. You cannot escape them. l want to know why you renounced the world. Why did you become an ascetic? What will you gain by knowing the reason? My mind will be at peace. Day and night this thought keeps tormenting me. Then listen. l was the daughter of a landlord. Father would always be worried about the debts. Brother would always be drunk. And l, l would dream of a fantasy world. l would sing, dance and play with complete abandon. Music and poetry were my passion. The moon plays hide and seek with the clouds... on the banks of the river The bride plays Holi in the month of Phagun Oh, beloved, don't mock me The moon plays hide and seek The beautiful fair maiden... The beautiful fair maiden said to her beloved See, my beloved The moon plays hide and seek with the clouds... on the banks of the river The stars were dancing The clouds sulkily went away See, my beloved The moon plays hide and seek with the clouds... on the banks of the river See my beloved. See my beloved Surabhi, you keep saying this. But do you know what a beloved means? Yes. l know very well. A very big beard. A Long tail. Long ears. And small horns on the head. Listen, Surabhi. You always make fun about your beloved. So many good proposals were shown to you. But you didn't like any of them. Look, l'm telling you... you'll never get the man of your dreams. lf this continues... you'll remain a spinster all your life. Did you hear what l said? Yes. My dear poetess, will you always play with the stars... Be happy with the moon and fly in the sky? Or will you at times listen to us as well? l will hear. l will hear. Surabhi! Surabhi! Are you listening? The wedding procession has arrived and the groom is waiting. Groom? Yes, there is a wedding. Whose? Neither mine nor yours. But Pushpa's doll is getting married. This is the groom? An animal with a beard and a tail? And he'll marry Pushpa's doll? Throw him away. Then will my doll remain a spinster? Yes, she will remain. Till... Just look at our beautiful bride. Our dear daughter is like a deer in a forest, the cuckoo in the garden, As graceful as a swan on the lake. The groom who weds her... will be a swan himself; handsome as the moon, a poet weaving dreams, or a painter. ls a groom being selected for this doll or for you? Listen, Surabhi. Dreams always shatter. People who weave dreams are often disappointed. You search for the man of your dreams... but you aren't interested in getting married. The doors of my heart are open My beloved didn't come Didn't come Oh friend, my beloved didn't come Clouds thundered but still... Clouds thundered but still the peacock didn't come to dance Oh friend, my beloved didn't come Oh, bee look, the orchards are blooming You keep searching for nectar far and wide What mistake have l made? Why don't you come towards me? Oh friend, my beloved didn't come Why're you laughing? This painting hasn't been completed for months. A brush in place of a sword, a flower instead of a shield... and look at his face! '?' - What's the meaning of '?' - You won't understand. His looks must be unique... And... And are you leaving or not? l'm going, ma'am! Sir, Holi is approaching. Shouldn't we celebrate? l know, Raghu. - Why ask me? - Sir, you are our master. Ask junior master, he takes care of business. The festival of Holi has come. We'll celebrate. This time we'll do Holi justice. But, junior master, l'm asking for the expenses. - How will it happen and from where? - From where? ls that my job? Come on, go. l just know that this time Holi will be nice, very nice. But the only worry is for money. Sir, the money can be easily arranged... - if you listen to me. - Speak. - Agree to Thakur Padam Singh's proposal. - Then? Then an amount of Rs. 500,000 is in our hands. - lt's a little less. - Make senior master agree to this alliance... and the amount will increase. Play with colors, play with colors, dear Festive days have come Fill up with color, oh new player Shoot the water gun and drench the sari The whole body is colored The whole body is colored, playful days have come Play with colors, play with colors, dear Festive days are here The bride is shy behind her veil The bride is shy behind her veil. Her sweetheart resides in her eyes The koel coos and says... the days of our youth are here Play with colors, play with colors, dear Festive days are here The beloved has lost body and heart The lake of beauty is overflowing Thirsting eyes say... the robbing days have come Play with colors, play with colors, dear Festive days have come - Who, who are you? - Thakur Padam Singh. - She's a fairy. - Let's go, junior master is waiting for you. - Hey, what happened? - Saw him? - Who? - The man who came to marry Pushpa's doll. - Really? - Yes! A long beard, long ears... l threw color on that monkey. Thakur, you've been enjoying. You celebrated Holi? Where? With whom? l was coming. On the way... Welcome, welcome. So, what did you think about this matter, Father? What can l say? We should ask Surabhi about this. Surabhi? When did Surabhi ever like anyone? Whenever she was asked she said no. She won't say yes even when she turns sixty. Then why are you asking me? Do what you think is right. Do understand... Do understand, oh monsoon Let my beloved come, let him come Let my angry darling settle matters for me Do understand... l will adorn my veil with lightning l will use black clouds to make collyrium The thundering of the clouds will become... the beating of my heart l will weave your small droplets into a garland To entice my sweetheart... To entice my sweetheart let me weave dreams Do understand, oh monsoon Let my beloved come Do understand... You understand, Bimla? Let my beloved come. Hey, hey, look, look. This is the same monkey, on whom l put color that day. - No, Surabhi. You shouldn't speak like that of him. - Why? Because your brother has fixed your alliance with him. - My brother has fixed my alliance with him? - Yes. Brother, have you made the deal? Surabhi, whatever l did was for your well being. This is for my well being? Father and l are able to think about my well being. How will you understand, you drunkard! Surabhi, this marriage will surely take place. lt might have, with some poor timid girl. But l am Thakur Sher Singh's daughter. So, then go to him. Why are you irritating me? Father! Dear, l know. But l'm helpless. Then, who else will help me? And l can't even wipe your tears. God, you should have ended my life before this day. Hunter Everyone is a hunter of beauty No one is a worshipper A beautiful woman is stuck among palaces Through deceit, by force... Through deceit, by force, the hunter robs body, mind, and youth Everyone is a hunter of beauty Buds bloomed in the orchard, and the hunter arrived He wasn't satisfied only by seeing... so he plucked all the buds Everyone is a hunter of beauty The beautiful deer was tired of running in the woods On seeing her golden beauty, the hunter gave chase Everyone is a hunter of beauty - Give me the fawn. - Why did you shoot it? - l'm a hunter. - You have no right to kill anything... or to snatch anyone's freedom. Whether l have the right or not, it's mine. - l won't give it. lt has sought my protection. - What's the dispute? - lt's my prey. - l saved it. The saviour has more right than the killer. So, what have you decided? - l won't go back. - Then what will you do? The earth is huge. l'll find a place somewhere or other. lf you wish to stay here then... l find a lot of mental peace here. - l wish to stay here forever. - What do you mean? lnitiate me. l'll stay with junior mother. When the heart is wounded, then the world seems worthless. But you are young. Unfulfilled hopes, suppressed desires... will trouble you, make you restless. l have no hopes... nor any desires in my heart. - You'll have to kill the heart. - lt has already died. Kindly allow me to devote myself to God here. Then do this: you'll be given an initiation for twelve months... lf you control over your heart... if no worldly illusions shake your faith... then after a year, you'll be given the real initiation. For a few days l stayed in senior mother's monastery. l found mental peace with her advice. The world seemed worthless and l took up asceticism. Since then l keep wandering in small villages... and unknown places away from the city. l sing religious stories to people. And l devote my heart to the service of God. Now l understand. This pain in your eyes, the deep melancholy... is a memorial of sweet dreams. lt's a suppressed plea. You're able to read me like an open book. l don't want to remember the past. And what's the use? Sharing your troubles will relieve your mind. Before meeting you l was at peace. Only on the surface. lnside, the embers were smothered by ash. But the fire blazed. l saw that fire in the pain refllected in your eyes. Stop it. Viju, please come and sit here. l sneezed. Aunt. Aunt, when you sneeze will you fall asleep? You're an atheist. You only know how to talk but not work. What shall l do? The dishes? Shall l grind flour? Light the stove? Tell me, what shall l do? Viju, you're going to the market, aren't you? No. No, not to market. - l'm going to Neelam Bagh. - You'll have to walk a little. Not now, Aunt. Then should l go and bring medicine for Meera Devi? Why didn't you tell me earlier that l've to go to the doctor? - Oh, if only you'd listen! - Oh, Aunt, if only you'd say. Look, dear, get the medicine from the doctor... and give it to the gatekeeper. After that you go wherever you wish, okay? - Mangu? - Who is it? - Where's your father, Mangu? - He went to the river to bathe. Look, aunt gave this medicine for Meera Devi. Deliver it. Give me, sir. But, sir my hands. Sir, you kindly go and deliver. She'll be in the old ruins. Lord, bless me peace. - Lord, bless me peace. - Devi. l brought medicine for you. The doctor prescribed two pills in the morning... and two in the evening with water. - Your eyes are red. Do you have a fever? - No. - lt seems you've cried a lot. - You can leave if you wish. - And if l wish to sit? - You can sit. But why? lf you wish to talk, l will talk. lf you like silence l will keep quiet. My eyes are closed and your eyes are staring at me. lt's to your advantage. A heart's desires and the churning of the mind can be read in the eyes. - The things that my eyes want to tell you... - l don't want to know. And what l want to read in your eyes, you're hiding from me. Gaining control over every weakness is my duty. One more thing. By suppressing developing feelings, won't they become stronger? That's your misconception. l quell them, crush them underfoot. lt seems senior mother gave you a lot of... knowledge in a very few days. A woman is born with forbearance and rules, the same way passion makes a man weak. Will you be my guru? Will you initiate me? - You find the world worthless? - No. l want to gain your company. Wearing ascetic clothes cannot help it. This requires a very big sacrifice. l'm ready. Then forget despair... and erase hope. - Then what will be left in life? - Ultimate peace. Won't unfulfilled wishes cause distress? ln such a condition we need to practice more self denial. This is the duty of ascetics. What should a worldly person do? Stay away from weakness. Otherwise one falls, pitfalls happen. Aren't some pitfalls welcome? For each minor pitfall... we have to practice intense austerity. - Once you used to write poems. - Now l compose devotional songs. l'm talking about your life before renouncing the world. - l used to write. - Do you have those poems? - l do. - Will you give them to me to read? Not now. You may go now. The boat is rocking... Cross safely, and l'll concede your skill, boatman Desires have surrounded my restless heart Pitdalls lie ahead at every step Save my honor, oh protector of honor Cross safely, and l'll concede your skilll, boatman The boat is rocking Cross safely and l'll concede your skill, boatman Darkness has spread everywhere l have no support apart from you Hold my hand, Krishna Cross safely, and l'll concede your skill, boatman The boat is trembling, if you row it across... Cross safely, and l'll concede your skill, boatman Devotees pleased you with devotional songs l entice you with my shedding of tears Help raise the one who is falling down, Kanhaiya Cross safely, and l'll concede your skill, boatman Father, why is the Devi going away? Dear, they are saints. They don't have a permanent home. Today she's here, tomorrow l wonder where she'll be. We may have affection for her. But she is an ascetic. Viju, l am going. l made tea for you. Where are you going so early, aunt? The whole village is going to bid farewell to the religious woman. l, too, will go. - Will you come? - You know l'm an atheist. You're not so fortunate as to see such saints. When will l get to see you again? Take me along, Mother. Who will look after you if l'm not there? Do you see how painful affection is? lf you have this much affection for God... your life will be successful. Take these prayer beads. When your heart gets restless... then chant the mantra, Lord bless me peace. You suddenly decided to leave the village? Why? My peace is disturbed at every turn. Why? When l begin to desire something... then leaving it is my duty. Will feelings change by a change of place? When the heart becomes restless, the mind gets confused. Then, to bring it under control, it's necessary to atone. So you gain control over the mind by atoning. Then what? After that, stay away forever from the object, the place... and the thoughts that breach mental peace. Forever? - Won't l ever see you again? - Never. lf you want me to be at peace... then don't take a step beyond this tree. Consider this the final boundary. The final boundary. The ascetic has left (the world) No one visits the pyre The ascetic has left The traveller has departed on his way The site is piled with ashes No companion, or beloved, no one to call one's own Only the angel of Death Meera's Lord, this false relationship... has broken like a weak thread The ascetic is leaving Viju, aren't you feeling well, son? Why don't you go to Bombay? Aunt, didn't you say, not to sell this house? You'll keep returning here time and again. And now you're ousting me from home? No, dear, it's not that. You keep quiet. lt worries me. You're worried. You go to Bombay, your restlessness will end. This restlessness won't end by going anywhere, Aunt. The faithful are so fortunate, Aunt. Go to the temple, plead to the idol and get what you want. But where should an atheist go to plead? Who can l ask for peace, Aunt? You left the village, that's good. What are my orders now? Chant the mantra of the Lord, let me find peace. And devote yourself to the service of God. A wounded man understands the condition of the wounded No one else would know l'll be relieved of my pain... only when my beloved treats me. No one could know the pain l'm crazy in love. No one knows my pain No one could know the pain Mother, l've brought fruit. Senior mother has said not to fast today. Make sure to drink a little milk or eat fruits. Senior mother knows well that l want to practice self denial. - Bindu, go and tell her. - ls this self denial or atonement? You eat after three days. And fast for three days. - My mind finds peace. - And the body remains hungry. - For what sin is senior mother punishing...? - Bindu. You love me very much, right? What worldly people call 'love'... ascetics like us call desire. Desire is a bondage. lt's our obligation to break it. Renouncing the world doesn't turn an ascetic's heart into stone. Mr. Vijay. Mr. Vijay. How are you? Oh, you still have a fever. And you're roaming outside? What to do? l can't feel at ease anywhere. l find peace on coming here. lt's raining. You won't be able to reach home. Lie down in the room. Come in. Come, relax. Senior mother, what's wrong with Bhagvati? Day and night she practices very strict self denial round the clock. - l'm afraid that... - Don't worry. This gives her mental peace. Lord, bless me peace. - Lord, bless me peace. - Mangu. - Lord, bless me peace. - Hey, Mangu. - Did you also become an ascetic? - Yes. Devi gave me these prayer beads. And she said, when the heart gets restless then hold... these beads and chant the mantra 'Lord, bless me peace'. Why is your heart getting restless, Mangu? l am not at ease since Devi left. Are you gaining peace on chanting the mantra? Yes, sir. You also seem lost and restless. Take these prayer beads. Restlessness is my peace, Mangu. lf my disquiet goes away, then what will be left in life? Arrange the articles for the worship. And ask senior mother, to kindly let me meet her. Mother, why do you talk like this... as if you want to bid farewell to us? Crazy girl, everybody has to bid farewell one day or another. And if it's so, then do something for me. Won't you, please? Look at that book. Take it to Kalinagar. There is a large tree on the boundary of the village. You'll find someone sitting there. Give it to him. His name? Name? Even l don't know his name. This is the last boundary. Never step past this. Don't go, l plead at your feet Don't go, don't go, don't go, yogi, l plead at your feet The path of devotional love is unique Guide me that way on it l will assemble a pyre of sandalwood Burn it with your hands Don't go, don't go, don't go, yogi, l plead at your feet l am burned into a pile of ashes Apply me on your body, yogi Meera's Lord is Giridhar Nagar (Krishna) Unite the flame with flame Don't go, don't go, don't go, yogi, l plead at your feet Om... Senior Mother, what's wrong with Bhagwati? Lord, at your feet... Sir, this book is for you. For me? Devi ordered me to give it to you. What else did Devi order for me? May l go and see her? Where is she? Lord grant peace. - Now you can see only her memorial. - What? The ascetic has left (the world) No one visits the pyre The ascetic has left The traveller has departed on his way The site is piled with ashes No companion, no one to call one's own Only the angel of Death O Meera's Lord, this false relationship... broke like a weak thread The ascetic has left
