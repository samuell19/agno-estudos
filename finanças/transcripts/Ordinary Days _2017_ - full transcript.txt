- Mom, I can't tonight I have midterms. Oh, I have to eat? Really? No one told me. You know what I'll come to dinner. Just don't wait up for me, okay, no promises. I gotta go. Sorry I didn't mean to scare you. - You didn't, but you might have scared the garbage can though. Shit. So, she calls this number back, this guy tells her she owes back taxes and he was apparently very aggressive with her. I mean she's elderly and he's scaring the crap out of her. Saying there's a warrant out for her arrest. Anyway, she sends him $5,000 just like that. - That's awful. Should be a crime. - It is a crime. Fraud. That's what they call it. - I'm sorry. - We talked about this when she moved out. - I know. - She's busy. Working, studying. Well, she should have called if she was gonna change her plans. - Need to give her some space. - Look at all this. It's a waste. - I don't think Carrie eats meat much anymore. - They found that boy's body. - Hmm? Caleb Rhimes, he's been missing for like a month. Oh my God. They found him Lake Winnetka. - Winnetka. What are we bringing tonight? - Hm, yeah, Sheila said to bring a veggie tray. - Of course. We're always on veggie trays. - I wonder if Barnard's on this case. - Shouldn't that guy be retired by now? - He's our age. Have a nice day. - You too. Hi, you've reached Cara, no you haven't. Seriously, text me. - We need a new rake. - I haven't been able to reach Cara. I've texted her, called her, nothing. - You leave a message? - Yeah, but. - She'll call you when she gets a chance. - I'm calling her work. - No, honey, hang up. She doesn't work there anymore. She quit. - How do you know that? - She's a big girl, she can make her decisions on her own. - She's 19. You gonna be okay for the tonight? - Yeah, yeah, of course. I'm fine. Did you not that? Thank you for driving. I've got Leah's cell number and the athletic center. You're sure you want to do this? - Rich, please. - What about Sydney? - Sydney? I don't if she talks to her anymore. - Worth a shot. - You're right, okay, her, too. Hi, this is Rich Cook, Cara's dad. I'm just trying to track her down. Have you seen her in the past few days? Well, we talked to her on the phone but she hasn't been back since Friday? You sure? No, no, no, it's not an emergency. Just a minor family issue. No, thanks. - What are you doing? You just disappeared. - She wanted a storage box for her old books and stuff. Something with a lid. She's an adult. - So she should know how to respond to a text and a voicemail. - She's busy. - None of her friends know where she is. - We don't even know all of her friends. Come on, she'll probably call any minute and then we'll feel stupid for all this nonsense. - Barnard would help. - He's probably got his hands full of this other case. He would do us a favor if we ask. - No. - I think we have to. - It's really coming down out there. After the news at the top of the hour, we will take a look at some of the in the area. - Hello. Hello. Congratulations you have been selected. - Have a great day. - I need to get to the site. - And what am I supposed to do, just sit around worrying, doing nothing? - Why don't you call your sister and go out for lunch or something? - She's got a thing on Mondays. - Then finish up in the garden. - The ground's soaking wet. - Christ. I'm sorry. - What is it, what's happening? - Nothing. It's nothing. There is a detective here to ask us some questions. That's all. - Christ. You called Barnard. I said not to call him. I was handling it. - Okay, well, he's here now so can we just? - Mr. Cook. Detective Jonathan Brightbill. - Sorry to inconvenience ya. - No, it's the job. If you're ever worried you should call. - So, what do we do now? - Well, I have a few questions. - So, do I. What about the girl that went missing back in the summer? - Rich. - And the Caleb Rhimes boy. Any connection? - Rich, stop it, what's wrong with you? - Maybe I can speak to each of you separately for a few minutes? - I'm sorry. Okay, well, why don't you email me some pictures whenever you get a chance. You know how to attach photos? Yes, I know how to attach photos. - So, you said you spoke to Cara recently? On Friday was it? Uh, yes, around 10:30. She was studying all day. History. - How did she seem? - She seemed like Cara. Distant. - Upset? - Irritated, at me. - That's normal? - She's a very private person. She doesn't like a lot of questions and I guess I just tend to ask a lot of questions. - Does she have a boyfriend, girlfriend, anything like that? - There was a boyfriend. But they broke up. - Okay. - She actually brought him back for one of the dinners. - Okay. What was his name? - Ollie. Oliver Santos. - Okay. Was she upset about the breakup? - No, it wasn't serious. She's not an emotional person. - What does that mean? - She's just. She's just one of the strongest people I know. She doesn't seem to need anybody. - Hm. - Do you have kids? - No, no. - When Cara was 16, I got breast cancer. She was amazing. She stayed home with me so much I don't know how she passed her classes that year. She went and got her license so she could take me to my treatments. And that's when she quit running. She had this dream to go to the Olympics. But after all that. Well, she felt she could never get back to that level. Can you imagine being so young and already it's too late? She bought us these. She has a matching one. They're supposed to be lucky. I don't if she still wears hers or not. She kept saying to me, mom think positive. Your thoughts have power. But I never had any positive thoughts. I always thought I was gonna die. - Well, Mrs. Cook, it doesn't sound like Cara ran away. - I don't believe she did. - Where do you think she is? - Your turn. - Marie. - Marie. Calm down, calm down. - Something's happened. Something's happened. I knew it and you did nothing. - Okay. - This is your fault. - Stop. - Fine, you handle it. Yeah, yeah, if you could just email me the cost reports, I'll take a look. We still haven't heard. Thanks. I'll make you some oatmeal. Hey. Leslie wants to come see ya. She says that picture of Cara's being shared around on Facebook. Honey, you can't stay in bed forever. Your sister's worried about you. I'm worried. Marie, I'm sorry. We should have called the police earlier on the weekend. I just didn't. I couldn't. Please. - Okay. I'll get up. It's so quiet. - What's that? I never realized how quiet it was. This house. When you just sit, don't move around and bang things about. I really notice. - Why hasn't he called? - Hey, hey, breathe. Yeah, you can breathe. You can. Okay, remember that. Come on. Just sit down until it passes. - Yeah. Right. - There you go. Don't. This will pass, okay. - Yeah. - It always does. You know that. - Yeah. - Okay. I'm gonna go get your pills. - Okay. - You're okay. - Okay. - Hello. - Alright, thank you for giving me a whole five minutes before your class. - I'd have met you at the house but my brother said he'd shoot you if he ever saw you again. - Andy used to like me. - Everyone used to like you. - Here. Put a little bit of extra cash in there if you want to get maternity clothes or whatever you need. What, I'm trying, I'm trying. - Yeah, sure you are. I can tell with how great you're looking. When's the last time you slept? Have you been going to the meetings? How's Charlie? - He's. - Leaving food out for him? Cleaning the box? - He's a cat, the cat is fine. Are you paying him any kind of attention at all? - If you want, you can come by, you can pick him up and take care of him yourself. You know Chris is allergic right? - Oh, of course. - You know, just for once. - What? What, what do you want me to do, what? - What's the point? - Susanna. Shit. Feeding the cat. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. - No, you didn't. You might have scared the garbage can though. Or he's dead and we have nowhere to go with it. Look, we're trying to figure this out. Who knows what they have going on? Look, you , I'll try to figure out another perspective. - Charlie. Charlie, where are you? Got some food for you. Stupid cat. Charlie. Charlie. There you are. Okay, let's go get you some food. - Brightbill. Now. You going to meetings? You should be on medical leave. Indefinite suspension. But everyone in this office is protecting you. Do you even care about that? 19 year old college girl. Been out of touch since Friday. - It's only Sunday. - Just go talk to her parents at least. Mother's an old friend. She's likely hungover, not answering the phone. Firs thing in the morning, okay? Somewhere, underneath all this garbage, is a good detective. - Mr. Cook this shouldn't take long. Alright. - I talked to her, on Friday. I don't know why I haven't told Marie yet, it's so stupid to keep it from her. Is this before or after your wife spoke to her. - Just after, I was meeting a client on a job site, she called me there. She smashed her car into a post or something on campus busting one of the tail lights. She was worried about how much it would cost to fix. She always worried about money. Taking money for school, food, and clothes from us. I mean, she's our only child, I don't why she feels so guilty. Did she tell you about her plans? For the weekend? - No, no, she was just on her way to the library, to study. Churchill. Do you believe that? What? - I just know one of the professors at the school, that's all. - Maybe they can help? - I'll check. - We never wanted more than one child. One child. We were always in agreement. I was terrified of course. But she was a good baby, quiet. She was walking at eight months old. Running by 15 months. Never wanted to be in a stroller, never wanted to be carried. Gosh, she must have been three years old. No, no, she was just four. We're at Costco, it was busy, Saturday morning, packed with people. And I kept trying to reason with her that she was little and it was unsafe for her to be walking around. I needed to sit still in the cart. She wouldn't do it. I would lift her up and she'd climb back out. I got so frustrated, I did the thing I never do, I snapped at her. She needed to listen to me because I was her father. She looks up at me, eyes wide as saucers, and she reaches up and says I'll hold your hand, daddy. Marie. Please. Calm down. Something's happened. Something's happened. I knew it and you did nothing. - Okay. - This is your fault. - Stop. - Fine, you handle it. - Mr. Cook, mind if it take this? - What? Yeah. Just find her, please. - I'll be in touch. - No, I don't want to deal with you today. I can't. - Enrollment office says that is a student of yours. She's missing since Friday. - Yeah, that's Cara. - Cara Cook. - Yes, I have a lot of students. - Is there anything notable about this one? - She seems smart and quiet. Ugh, her parents must be freaking out. - Yeah, her roommate Leah Delonge said that she saw her on Friday. Said that Cara was going up to Wellesley for something. Her mom was expecting her home for dinner. She told her dad that she was going to be stuck in the library studying. Nobody actually knows where she is so. Nothing but dead ends here. - You're pretty intense about this case. - Yeah, I saw her. Here on Friday, after I spoke to you. You believe that? - Did you tell her family? - No, as of right now, I'm the last person to see her alive. - Hey, this is your job, finding people. You're good at it. - I used to be good it. - You're good. I have an ultrasound tomorrow at one. - Well, are you okay? Everything's alright? - Yeah, it's routine if you want to come. - You want me to be there? If you want me to be there, I'll be there. - I want you to do whatever you feel is right. I'll text you the address of the imaging place. Come, don't come, you know where I'll be. Um, Cara is dating a student of mine. Ollie Santos. - Yeah, Oliver. - Yeah. - According to her mom they broke up a few weeks ago. - Well, kids these days, nothing sticks. Hey maybe this dead end is just an unpaved road. What is that a country song, did you write that? - Yeah. - Is that your material? If I ever write a country song you mind if use that. - Sure. - Okay. - Bye. - Too serious a girl for me. - And what does that mean, like you guys, she wanted to get married or something? - No, dude, I mean serious, like, yo, lighten up. Never knew what she was thinking. Okay, so it was unlikely that she ran away with some mystery boyfriend on a drunken bender. I don't know why you're asking me. We dated for like a month. Let's just say I felt pretty much superfluous. - Superfluous? - I go to class, straight C+'s baby. - Was Cara having any money troubles? - Who doesn't? Every kid in here is in the hole one way or another. Tuition, car payments, boozing. - I heard she applied to some new jobs. You have any idea where they might have been? - Factories up north probably. I applied to a bunch but to get into you gotta go to the dumb job fairs, but to do that you gotta have a car to get your ass down there. - You heard the part where I mentioned your ex girlfriend is missing right? - I don't have her body stashed in my dorm. In case you're wondering. Hey, what the hell, man? - This is serious. - I don't know anything. What do you want from me. I want you to care, I want you to pay attention, I want you to help me, can you help me right now. - Okay, sorry, dad. You don't know my life. - I know exactly who you are and right now you're gonna help me out with this shit okay. Can you do that? You're capable of that? Now tell me where were these factory jobs that you applied to? - Huh? - The jobs that you were applying to. - A couple of car factories that have temp jobs and another one that manufactures A/C units and fridges and shit. Stuff, sorry. And the bottled water plant. Great for the environment but the pay is insane. - Where? - Uh, just outside of Wellesley. - Wellesley? Off of highway 25? - Okay then. Hey man, you aren't stealing push pins I hope. That humor's why all the ladies love you, Eddie. - Oh, sure, that and so many other reasons. Something we can help you with? - You see, there? There she is. - Yeah, there she is. - Grabbed a hot pocket and a Gatorade, blue raspberry flavor. I got a good memory. - Yeah, you do. Did she seem agitated or nervous or? - No, not really, she didn't say much. She paid and she was off. - Can you just go back to the part where she's paying you? Who's that? - Oh, that's Wardy Anderton. He has a farm up the way. He likes the beef jerky although he says they're for his dog. He does the sports line betting. - Where's your outside surveillance. - Here. Ward's harmless. - Ha, see, there. He says something to her. Merlin! - Ward Anderton? - Shot another one, huh. Shot my dog walking by the highway over there. Was picking up people's garbage bringing it back. Come on in, I suppose. - Thank you. - Hey, hey. Sit. I'm not much of a housekeeper. Last copper was here kicked up a due to the dust. Got him out of here real quick, though. Wife died 10 years ago. 10 years of dust builds up I suppose. Put a little something in there, take the edge off. I guess you can't drink on duty huh? - Yeah, something like that. This is Cara Cook, 19. She's been missing since Friday night. - Another one. Cops are really on top of things huh? - Here's the thing. This is her last known whereabouts. - I don't remember much. Merlin was barking at her and so I shushed him. I apologized, I got in my truck and I drove away. Well, actually, no, no, no, she drove away first. You can see it in the security feed. How long did you follow her? - I didn't follow her. She pulled out ahead of me in the parking lot and was gone, that's it. Okay, well that rest stop only has one entrance and one exit out. - Is this connected to that boy or what? I don't know, what do you think? - What do I think? What do I think? I think that I am sick and tired of being harassed just because I live alone in the middle of all this mess. - Okay, so it just so happens that three teens have gone missing in the past year. One teen washed up on the shore of the lake that lines your property. And the most recent teen, Cara Cook, Mr. Anderton you were the last one to see her alive. So, it just so happens. - Every ordinary day's full of just so happens. Most of 'em we don't even notice. Too wrapped up in our own corner of the world. My wife isn't dead. - What? - I just figured that's the kind of thing you check. She left me 10 years ago. She is still alive somewhere. I didn't want you to think I was a liar. - Then why'd you lie about it? - I don't know. I mean if someone left you 'cause you weren't good enough would you go around bragging about it? - She go north or south? - I came right home here. - Can anybody vouch for that? - Merlin. - Shit. Alright, Mr. Anderton. If anybody other than Merlin here can account for your whereabouts on Friday, you have 'em give me a call alright? Did I miss it? Did I miss it? - Yeah, you did. - I wanted to be there. I was working. It's this case. Come on, Susanna, please. - Everything's fine. There's a follow up next week. - Wait, wait, when? - It's routine. The baby's healthy. It's a girl. - Caleb's body was found here. Cara Cook disappeared between here and here. The Anderton acre which extends to here. You can't ignore that proximity. - Well, it might be enough to get a warrant to search his farm. Type it up, see if we can execute it today. And you continue to follow Cara's trail separately. - Anderton saw her, he took notice of her. - Just, just find the girl. - This is the same case. - Not yet. She might still be alive. Find her. - Her necklace is in his house. This girl has been missing for five days, Janine, five. - We've got warrants on the way. Within the hour. Tell me you'll wait. - Freeze, do not move! Don't move! First thing I want to see is your hands raised. Step back into the doorway, now! Step in slowly. Other hand, too. Where's the dog? - He heard someone. - Drop the necklace. I just found it, I don't know where it came from. - Alright, put your hands on your head, turn around slowly, and get on your knees. - Okay. - Knees, now! - Okay, okay, okay. - Is she in the house? - No, no, no one's in the house. - Then where is she? It's over, just tell me where she is! - Please, please, please, don't harm him. - I just need to find her alive. I need everything to be okay. Get up. - Where are you taking me? - Keep walking. - Please, please, please. - Keep looking forward. - Okay. - Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh my God. Don't tell mom, shell freak out. - Sorry about that. He's harmless. - Help, somebody help me! Please! Is anybody there? Hello. Hello. Hello. Help. Hey! Hey! I'm trapped down here! My leg is stuck! Hey! Ah, yes. Hey, look. Now we're twins. Hey, help! Help! Hey! There you are you bitch. Mom. Mom! Shit. Hey. Hey. Hey buddy. Hi. Hey. Hello. Hello. Wait, no, hey. Hey. Wait, come back. Hey buddy. Come here. Hey, come back. Hi. Hi. Hey buddy. Hey. Hey. Hey, come here, buddy. Stay, stay, stay, stay. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Come on. Stay. Good dog. Go, go. Sam. Daniel. Just tell me. Stop mocking me. You win again, Calvin. Even throughout large tracts of Europe, many states have fallen or may have fell in to the grip of the Gestapo. Thanks dad. Hey mom and dad. Um. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. The longer you can look back the farther you can go forward. When you're going through hell, keep going. Never, ever, ever give up.
