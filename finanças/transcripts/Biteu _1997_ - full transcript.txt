I didn't have a dream. I was seventeen but had nothing to do. Every night I hung out with Tae-soo and brawl with other guys. That was all back then. Son-of-a-bitch! Hey, son-of-a-bitch! You, son-of-a-bitch! Come! Wow it's probably around 3 million. Wait, I'll buy her. I'm for real, man. I'll let you ride her, only you. You know those guys? Seniors two years before us. They want me to work for them. I got scouted. I thought about it. I can't live such lowly life. I'm finding my need. Get it on. I'm moving, to north of the river. Must be my grades. Going to college? I didn't have to go to college. I was tired of everything I just wanted to run away. Of course I didn't think much would change by transferring from the beginning... Kid, you're late on your first day of school? Kids these days are out of it... You... where are you staring when I'm talking to you? Look at my eyes. If I catch you bullying other students I'll kill you, do you understand? Answer me, kid! Yes. Looking like a punk... Hey, Mr. Kim! He's a transfer kid. Go on. Come here. Nice to meet you. Are you Lee Min? I'm your homeroom teacher. Let's try to get along. Hwan-gyu was my first friend at the new school. Hwan-93/" was proud to sniff glue since 5th grade and told everyone about it. Had some fair fight? Son-of-a-bitch. Do you know who I am? Today, you die. Hwan-gyu tended to bluff a lot but he was a nice kid. Alright? Fuck you. I had it easy for you. You die today if I fight for real you hear me? Stop, shit! Congratulation, Ae-sun. - Congratulations. - Thanks. Blow it. Congratulation. Congratulation. - Oh, thanks. - Congrats. Mine's a beeper. I got a pager from mom this morning. What else can I get you? Boyfriend who looks like Brad Pitt. No! Then you can't go to college. Jo Hwan-gyu. What are you doing? Hey, what are you doing? Get out here, now. I'm going to kill you. Consider yourself lucky. I fought with 17 guys last year and hurt my back. If not for that you are dead, fucker. Want to go again? Just kidding, dude. Shall we go to our wallet? He's very strong. Sold for 50 thousand won! Highlight of today's slave-ting... Lee Min! 15 thousand won! We got 15 thousand won. We got 18 thousand won. 50 thousand won! Got 50 thousand won! 100 thousand won! 100 thousand won? 100 thousand won! Hey! You can't turn him to another table! Then continue betting. No way. I'll count to three, three! One, two, three. Congratulations. Hurry and take him. Hey, you're sold. Come here. What's your level? What? What's your level? Your school grade. Can you go to college with that? Do you study well? 1st level! Since 1st grade. I like Beetles. I just do. Honestly, I like you. But know this. You're my slave. Don't tell anyone my number. When I call you you have to run to me, OK? Time for academy, bye. Oh, my son. Were you studying? Why are you keep drinking? At your new school don't hang out with a bully like Tae-soo. Urgh, trying to send you to college I run around trying to sell insurance all day. It's me, Romy. LG and Lotte is having a playoff tomorrow at Jamsil Stadium. GO and take a detailed note including stadium's atmosphere. If the note is wrong or not sufficient you lose your slave position. OK, Lee Min? Bye. They are so skinny and dance so well. You know LG cheerleaders In 9th inning with 2 out LG sent out alternative. They boldly took out number 4 batter. What would happen to LG then? They can't change back but go on with it. Of course, they got hit. It was awesome. You are so relaxed when our mock test starts next week. You loosen the string when you're not playing violin. Aren't those kids who study even on weekends such losers? So what if you go to college that way? You are amazing. You came? I'm off. If I knew you were crazy about baseball I would've gone with you. I don't like baseball. Sex, screen, sports they all make people stupid. Do you think kids who go to see baseball can go to college? No way. All my friends are level 1. 3% of total rank. 12 just from my school. Depending on the test score I might fail. Are you afraid to fail? No, but I can't let them beat me. My pride won't allow that. Everything's a competition for survival. Nastier and dirtier you get you win. Do I gross you? No, honestly I... respect someone who have clear goal like you. Slave should respect his master. Romy was different from all the girls I've seen before. She always had a nice scent. From her head to toe... From her confidence she was full of nice scent. No! If you do this I might lose my pace. I like you. So you go to college as well. Lee Min! Hey, someone's calling your name. Lee Min! Lee Min! It's been 4 months. But Tae-soo didn't say much. I quit school. It's been 2 months already. Yo, Min. Check this out. I asked the cook to be nice and it's a mountain. My goodness. Yo, give some drink. And wait a bit. I paged hot legged college chick. I think I can drink a whole lot more today. Hwan-9Y'~'- Yeah. I'm sorry but we need to talk in private. OK. Call me for the bill, OK. What is it? Just I just missed you. I'll go now. You drank a lot. You shouldn't ride the bike. Don't get off. I got her today. I thought who would ride her if I don't. Fuck. Answer came too quickly. You. This is my work. Don't butt in, never! What are you fuckers doing! Son-of-a-bitch! Hey! what do I do with this? Tae-soo! Tae-soo! I just stared at Tae-soo being dragged away like an animal. I couldn't forgive myself. Yours? Don't get the power of the bike and you confused. You look retarded. Mom, it's me. Why are you so late? English teacher waited more than 30 minutes. Let QQ! Don't have any feeling for me? I'm a studying machine until I go to college. Machine has no feeling nor time. ROmy! I think I'll get to like her a lot. College entrance exam was near but in my head was all but Tae-soo and Romy. Sitting at the desk was meaningless. I simply waited for Romy's page. You messed up your mock exam? Like you I digressed and met some boys. I lost my focus. Did In-kyeong mess up too? She's worse. You are so amazing. You party all you can and keep number 1. Cheer up, as long as you do well on the entrance exam. In worse case, you can repeat. Do this one more year? I'm scared to face mom. If I can't get into Seoul University she said go kill myself and save family embarrassment. That's harsh. Your sister and brother all went to Seoul University. In-kyeong! I work so hard for him but he doesn't know that. Ms. Kim, calm down. He'll get better score if he works harder. VVhafslevel7? Level7". Now you know, feel better. I'm just going to graduate. Drop out! Get GED! With your brain, you can go to college. Don't push him too much. And you try to understand your mother. Mister, are you going to live with my mom? Why you. Don't talk to him that way! Be nice to my mom. Min, Min, Min, Where are you going, Min? Min! Min! I'm not going home. "You will want to scream your head off." What do you want to drink? I'll go call my friend. Hwan-gyu? It's me. I'm sorry but I can't go today. Just No, man. No, crazy bastard. Romy! Romy! Romy, open the door! ROmy! Romy. That was last I saw Romy. What did I say if you hit Myung-yeon again? I got easy with you since graduation is around the corner. - Don't act sissy, kid! - Urgh, teacher. - Stay still! - I'm sorry. Stay still, kid! With this grade, you can't even apply to technical college. You can never be decent human being! Stay still! You punk. How about you going to employment class? Yes? What are you bastard? Stop beating him. Isn't hitting outlawed? Hwan-gyu, gel UP- Min! When the speed is at its peak you fall into silence. You fall into one dot. But you can't pass that vanishing point. It grows farther as you approach. Romy, where are you? I'm going to open this mega restaurant. Wearing three button black suit driving a sedan with chick like Meg Ryan on my side. Wouldn't it be awesome? What will you do? What should I do? Anything will be better than now. Geeze, I just hope I don't get expelled. My old man's hope is me finishing high school. - Hwan-gyu. - Yeah? Can I live with you? What's up with run away at your age? Fine then. Jerk, you're upset. Min. Rent is half. Min, it's me, Tae-soo. I'm doing well. I adjust well anywhere I go. I add 10 more push-ups every week. 200 is no problem now. I hear that you didn't take the college exam. Dude, what did I tell you? Not us. We have to take our path. Yo! it's almost a year now. Dude, I miss you. Min, hi? It's me, Romy. You didn't forget about your status cuz your master isn't around, did you? I am at... a very peaceful place. So it can get boring sometimes but I think this sitting back is good. I was too busy. I miss you sometimes. Then, I'd write a letter. Maybe I'm lazy but I never mailed my letters. Same thing will probably happen with this one. Already 2 years have passed. But my life was till tedious and boring. - Money is off, look. - How should I know. Hey, come here. Why? Did you take the cash? Who said? Who saw me stealing? Who else is here? Money is off at your shift. So why do you take it out on me? So what if you're the owner? Shit, I'll just quit. I quit. Watch who you're talking with. - Come here. - Hwan-gyu. I'm going to kill you son-of-a-bitch. What's the matter with you? - I don't know! He's making me a thief. - You punk. Why is it my fault the money is off? You fucking bastard! - Fucking? - Hwan-gyu! - Fucker! - What the fuck. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Sir. Fuck off, punk. - I was being easy with the old man. - You punk, are you with him? I'm putting both of you behind the bar today. I'll teach you two some lesson. You really didn't steal? What the fuck. Have I ever lie to you? What that fucking, urgh. It beats the shit out of me. Did you see? Did you see Hwan-gyu taking the money? Huh, did you? How can you call someone a thief without seeing? Just cuz we work for you? Are you looking down on us? Shit, I quit. Call the police I'll burn this place. Prosper you son-of-a-bitch. I'm sick of looking for job now right? Let's go for steak for a change. I helped myself to some cash, man. You think he'll give us retirement money. Hey, urgh. OK, OK, OK, OK, go. Go easy. What's you and that deaf beeper. You are forever fondling it? Throw it out, throw it. Did you look for job? Why are you staring. It's my old man's retirement fund that he sent. Shit, everyone's doing business so why not me. Not everyone's fit for business. You're too young. 21 is too young? My old man says that I'm the man of the house. He popped kids like a rabbit. I got four youngsters, four. Take it It's about 2 million won. Bastard when did you save this up. Min, get out here and take a look at this. Isn't it awesome? Did I spell it right? It's been long time. Yeah. Tae-soo came back. Watching his broad shoulder from his back makes me feel good. Man, I'll never leave you. Isn't it cool? I'm going to open one in a bit. Welcome. Go to Ms. Shin. Tell her I said so. Yes, I'll check. Yes! Let's go. Hey, let's go drink at Paradise. Shit, I'm finally going to classy karaoke. Welcome. How is it tonight? We got two table so far. - Ms. Shin in? - Yes. What? Aren't you working? Punks! They're my friends. Let them in. This place is a killer. Interior is killing. Hey, let's go. - Have some drink. - OK. You boys asked me to work with you but not kicking me out. Fine, I hate working anyway. Go and tell him. Give me my money! You fucked this place up. You should compensate. Are you threatening me? Showing your true color, ha. Fuck the... urgh. - Woman. - What, asshole? I don't have the experience burying a woman. Would you give me the honor? Oh, Tae-soo is here. Why is it so hard to see you these days? I missed you so much. Let's no make things harder for both. This time of my breathing where would it take me? This place with many joy and sadness? You are damn to handsome. You're no match. Come here, hurry. Go on, go on. Wow, I'm wide awake. Thanks, Tae-soo. Man, it's nothing. You need your bike back. She's yours. I prefer four wheels now. O come see me often. Got a lot of work ahead. But... I got no one to trust. Our store open in two days. You think you're fit for that work? Bro, why waste your talent? Fighting is a talent? Maybe it does. Then, I'll let it rot. Whether you own a company or a gangster success is all the same. No, I don't like that. I just want to live plain. I don't have the talent. Tae-soo, you know like thin noodle I want light and long life. That's my dream, bro. You didn't change a bit. You, too. Hey! Ah, shit. You're crazy? Get your filthy lips away from me. - Hwan-gyu! - Get away. Hwan-gyu, Jo Hwan-gyu. Let's go. Son-of-a-bitch. I'm sorry, Sunah. We're going dish shopping tomorrow. - Bro. - Urgh, it's our opening. Next time you come come alone, alright? Hey,Sunah! Tae-soo! It's good to see you, man. I'll take you out next time. Sunah. Let's go, go. - Bye. - OK, bye, see ya. Yo! Life was easier in high school, right? What's there to worry? What worry? Want to go back? Are you sick? Blood drains to my brain when I think of that bastard. Hot pepper. Shit. - Ah, nice store. - Business doing good? Is it good? - Why are you doing this? - Doing what? Fuck, get lost! What's the matter? You fuckers don't know? Fuck, you open without registering with us? Sir, I'm sorry. About everything. You! Stop yapping and go make two ramen. Yes, yes. Take it easy. Please. Some assholes get monthly security fee. But not us. Once at the open. As initiation and that's it. Bring 2 million won. To the billiard. 2 million? Son-of-a-bitch. Why? Too little for you? Think well. Till this Saturday. You're not really giving them are you? You think I'm afraid of them? Hwan-9Y'~'- I put everything into this store. Give it to them. It's not a monthly thing. Give it to them and do business happily. Romy was really waiting for me there. Romy who never left my heart. Romy is standing in front of me. I was at Manhattan all two years. Right in front of Central Park. Do you know why I like New York so much? They aren't interested in others. Nobody cares. No one criticize anyone for anything. Only in New York. Only possible in New York. I didn't think you'd keep the pager. I was waiting for it to ring. Get a surprise for you. There's a bar I go a lot. They have awesome band there. I recorded it for you. Listen. Are you back for good? Shhh, this is the best part. Bro, it's me. What are you doing here? Wow, is this your bike? It's awesome! Do you know how much I wanted to ride this? Take me for a ride. I'm sorry but I'm busy. Sunah! Oh! What are you doing here? Do you live around here? See ya. Come and see me. OK. Wait, Sunah! Wait, wait. Let go. I'm busy. Hey, hey, Sunah. When's your day off? - Why? I don't have one. - No, wait. Uh, why, what? - What's with the fuss? - What's wrong with you? I couldn't see Tae-soo like the old days. We stayed in touch over the phone. He always asked me to work with him. I always turned it down. I'm scared. Tae-soo sounding confident. But I wanted to believe that he's doing well. There's not only good and bad things in life but what's right and not right for me. There are various parts in a human body. They are differ in time to cut them out. Sign it. Bastards you are asking for death! Son-of-a-bitch. Which part of town are you from? I work with Scorpion. Scorpion? He's still not retired? Stand back! If you come close I'm slicing him. Then you die, too. Fuck you. You think I can't. Shit. Put down the knife! Fuck! Get him! I can't control this feeling. My love. My feeling.

What, why are you still here? You can't be here. These guys. When did you open up? About a month. We really didn't know. Isn't there any other way? You should've checked before signing. Hey, hey! Who are you? I said stay outside. Listen to me. I feel for you but what can I do? He stabbed me with a knife! Hwan-gyu! If you want a hole in your stomach come on fuckers! If you touch my store I'll kill all of you. What's wrong with you? Are you crazy? Punk! Yeah, I'm crazy, punk! Would you go crazy. So not much of your money went in. But I'm shit because this store son-of-a-bitch! No way. Just try me. Put the knife away! Get out! This is wrong put the knife away! I'll kill you, too son-of-a-bitch! Where are you running? What the?

Your friend's offense is not good. But the guys in investigation and prosecutors are my friends so settle and I'll need large sum to oil each one of them. You bastard! I don't need this! Crazy bastard can't tell fish belly from human's. Go and stab me. Stab me, you bastard. Ma'am, stop it. Urgh, what's going to happen to my family now? Punk, you think you got some guts? Did you bring it? I'm sorry. This is for settlement. Please settle before indictment.. I promise to give you the rest. 2 million more. Then we'll settle. Listen, we're being generous cuz we know your situation. Punk, go ask anyone on the street? Who'd settle at 5 million in such case. Shit. I got nothing more to sell. We started so we don't have the reason to turn down the fight. He probably can't fight himself. He can't use his arm. Woo-jin got good fighters under him. That's how they survive with limited number. What? I'm here to see Myung Tae-soo. My name is Lee Min. He's my friend. Ask him to wait! Who is he? I told you earlier. Lee Min... My childhood friend. Dude, should've called me. What's up? Are you busy? No way, you're here. Let's go. Hwan-gyu! How did I get out? I waited since 9 in the morning dude. Eat this. Where did you get the money for the lawyer? It's behind us. Forget it. Let's go get something to eat. What do you want to eat? Does Sunah know about this? How would she? Let's tell this to Sunah. '"- fought with 17 gangsters and am in hiding. Uh, you crazy bastard. Fucking bastard. Uh, you punk. - I've been to jail! - Oh, come on, come on. - Come here, come here! - Mommy! What, bastards! Hey, bastards! You bastard! You bastard! Stop! Keep you word. These days, not many gangsters keep their word. I let you by this once. If you try this again it means war. Let's go. They might attack any time. Have men stand by 24 hours. Come here. - Sung-ho, take over the place. - Yes. Bring all your boys. Have them guard 24 hours every place, alright? Yes! ' You! ' Yes! Being a gang is a hard business. You can never trust anyone. My boss is crazy about you. Your name is Min? Let's go for some drink. See you. Geeze, you and your temper... Take it, it's a bonus. I'm not doing it again. This is it. Do you know that I lied? Romy have never been to New York. She was at a sanatorium at Gangwondo for over a year. She also told me about her friend In-kyeong's death. But to listen to Romy's pain I was too exhausted. People all look so happy. Except for me. How many people would feel they are happy? I was always proud that I'm best since I was young. I fell one day. Do you know what my dad say? I fell down in earlier part of my life race. If I hurry up, get up and run I can run faster than any other. Do you think so? You still don't know me. Me getting up and running again looks so disgusting. Do you... want to know how I really think of you? You'll eventually go to college. After college you'll meet a guy from nice family and get married. You are... out for a walk right now. I know. Let QQ! Romy was living in her own hell. I also didn't live in heaven for last 2 years. Everything's coming apart. Things laid in front of my eyes. Let's talk seriously about this. Romy, do you remember what Richard Bark had said? Bird flying high can see farther. If you go abroad, your view with broaden. I don't want to fly high nor see far. If I fly low I can see things clearer. ROmy! I don't want to talk anymore. sit! I said I'm not going to college. Then go abroad. Aren't I in abroad? I'm supposed to be abroad so I don't embarrass the family. You don't have to go abroad! But with your personality you can't take your colleagues looking down on you. Romy, you just fell during the race. Only if you'd get UP- Please stop saying that, dad! I want to stay down. For the rest of my life! You're drunk. Hwan-9Y'~'- Later on... open a grand restaurant. OK! OK, thanks. Min! Do you how hard it was to find this place? My arms ache from carrying this heavy thing. Hello? Come in later. The room is a shit. I ran away from home. Let's go in. Romy did everything as she liked. She suddenly appeared and shoot me up. But I was glad. Did you eat dinner? Can't you tell your friend toleave? I want to with you only. Romy, this is Hwan-gyu's place. I'm living off him. I had no choice but turn to Tae-soo. Come in. Tae-soo got us a place to stay. And lent some money as well. I wasn't too fond of it but I was glad that I can do something for Romy. Wait here. Do you like it? No? No. Are you close with Tae-soo? Yeah, he's my best friend, why? I don't like him. Sort of scary too. I just don't feel good. Urgh, another worry with a place to stay. What is? Isn't it strange? There's no furniture when the house is this big. Aren't you getting LIP? Did you make breakfast? Get up. OK, OK. I'm up, I'm up! Yeah, I've been to jail. So that's not a problem. The problem is how you live. That's not a problem, shit. Min, he paid me his due is all. Hey, hey! Have you done that? What? That, man and woman, sex. Did you? Hey, answer me. Don't you want to do it with me? I'm reading a book. What did I tell you? We're not meant to be. Hey, don't you want to when you see me? So, how is it? How does it feel? - Give it here. - Tell me, hurry, huh? That's when both want to do it naturally, give it here! Don't you want me? - Don't answer that! - I have to. Don't, tell me, hurry! Where are you going? Come here, come here. - Hello? Yeah. - Don't answer, hang up. - Yeah, it's me. - Hang up. We have to hurry and talk about this. - OK, see you later. - Hurry. Where are you going? Tae-soo needs to see me. I'll be right back. You two are Section B. - Du-il. - Yes. Sung-hoon you two have the most important roll. It's our call so full attack. I'm scared. Is it because I love her so much? Hurry and put them on! Now, listen while you're dressing! Understand that we work for Dongah Labor, OK? Yes! Shit, give me extra large. Extra large. Just wear it, punk. I don't know when she'll leave me. Such a loser to have such thought... Let's stop them! Stop them! Let's Things got worse. They put their lives on it and shit. OK. Gather up! Listen. Try not to hit the head. Shoulder or legs, alright? 'Yes! ' Begin! Take it. - I'm leaving. - Bastard... Just stand by is all. Is this talent and success you were talking about? I did worse things than this. You're not in a position to pick and choose! - I'm disappointed at you, Myung Tae-soo. - Lee Min! Min! I don't do anything by force! - They broke through, what should we do? - Shut up, bastard! Bro! Sung-hoon, hold back! Hey, left. Bastard, they're pushing us in. You fuckers! Get yourself together. You fuckers. Hold back, Sung-hoon! You're one of them, you punk! Everyone, he is the gangster! Don't you have a parent like us? You son-of-a-bitch! Min! Get away, son-of-a-bitch! Min! Fuck. Kill them, fuck! You didn't sleep? I'm sorry I tried to come back early... You do as you like I'll do as I like. Romy, why are you doing this? You don't know? I need someone to stay with me when I need him. What should I do every time you do this? Since when did you care about me? I'm sorry, it's all my fault. I saw In-kyeong. She was staring at me. It was so scary I couldn't breathe. That's how I waited for you. You're all I have. - I'm sorry. - But what are you? I'm sorry. I didn't know you still had those nightmares. It's not a nightmare I really saw her. Hey that's...just a vision that you made up with your conscience. It's time for you to get over it. Don't treat me like a patient. ' ROmy! ' I-Gt gg! I don't want to talk to you anymore. ' ROmy! ' '-9* go! Let g°I Look what you did to me! Let go, bastard. You only think about you? You think I don't have any problem? I got my problems too! Why do you only care about yourself? Hey, hey! Have you ever given a serious thought about me? I can't pretend like you. Everyone thinks about himself. Let QQ! I wanted to hold her. But I couldn't manage Romy. I get scared when I'm with her and empty when she leaves. Have a nice night. Your dance is a work. Go on with your dance. Sunah,Sunah. What? Wait, I got you a gift. A hat. Dude. Do you know how happy I am now that you'll be with me? ha! People say that I made it quick but... no, I'm still young. Know what my dream is? To be a real giant. Anyone would know and I won't envy anyone. Min, I really made up my mind. No one can mess with a guy who got his place. Watch me, how big this Myung Tae-soo would grow. I envy you. I'm useless. Hey,dude. You're the only one I trust. Today...we drink till we drop, alright? I drank too much. Hey, one more bottle. - I'm beat. - Think of me. - I don't want any gift. - I got it for you. - Min! - Oh, Min! Are you alright? I'm fine, let go. Still... Min, Min. Tae-soo stands confidently in center of his life. But I'm not in my life. Min! Hurry and Qet "P- How long did I sleep? Sleep more, it's still night. Do you want some water? Do you know what my dream is? It's to be a famous singer. How about you? Don't have one. I want you to be my boyfriend. Do you like me? Yup. I can't make you happy. - I got nothing. - That's alright. Get up, get UP- Aren't you out of control these days? Get out. Get this out. Ah, ah, ah, ah. I said get out. Am I wrong. Punk, do you know what you look like now? Son-of-a-bitch.

Jo Hwan-gyu you listen to me good. I don't sleep with just anyone. - I really like Min. That's why. - OK. Is that so wrong? Let me manage Sang-ho's stores as well. Don't be too aggressive. I can do it. If you trust me I'll put my life on it. Don't you trust me? If you grow too big too fast people will go after you. I'm not afraid of that. I am. If possible, go steady and easy. That's my rule. It's me, Tae-soo. Just called to see if you're alright. Call me. It's me, Hwan-gyu. Answer. NOW! - Hwan-gyu? - Come by the window. - Last time, I drank... - I said come by the window. Now, I don't owe you anything. It's strange. I can't remember Romy's face. But Romy's scent... I miss her so much. This is better than pork barbeque. Enjoy. Welcome. Give me some more soup. Yes. Careful...it's hot. Hwan-9Y'~'- Give me a bottle. How's the business? Do I still owe you something? Hwan-gyu, I'm sorry. I'm sorry about Sunah. I'm really sorry. What will you do if I sleep with Romy? Let's not see each other again. I'm just a burden on you. I'm going to change now. I can make it on my own so don't worry about me. Want my advise? You're not the gang type. Stop following Tae-soo and mess up your life. You're smarter than me so you'll know better. I'm busy. Hey, is boss in? Yes, you're here? Congratulations, boss. It looks nice. You'll soon be a millionaire. Sit. You guys stay outside. Things didn't end right last time. You know it'll get ugly if it's on media? If we do some work for the prosecutor it won't last 2 years. While you're in Woo-jin will look after your work. You know each other. Give me some time. Punk, how many times did I tell you? Aren't you home? Min, it's me Tae-soo. Scorpion turned against me. This means war. Come now. There's no time. Gi-chul isn't picking up the phone. Maybe the word got out? You think Scorpion is a fool? Punk! He cut off my hands and legs then he begins! I have to hit him quickly! - It's over if we miss tonight. - Yes. Stop it. Stop it. Let go, come here. Promise me that you'll only love me. What will you do now? I don't know. I might go to the army. Go to college. If you start now you can enroll next year. Don't overestimate me. I don't know if I can. You didn't even try. You can do it, too. I'll stay in school. Let's get married as soon as we enroll into college. Go to Paris or the US a year later. I'll help you till the exam. I can't focus when I'm home, too. - Son-of-a-bitches! - Come on out! Where are the fuckers? This is! - Come on out, fuckers! - Hey, where are you? What's this? Fuck! Hello? Bro, there's trouble. Tae-soo is in danger. - We're at the club. - Son-of-a-bitch... Hello, hello? Where are you going? Huh? Convenient store. I'm out of cigarette. Want me to go with you? No, I'll be right back. Good night. I'm returning your blade. I'll kill you. I'll make you a cripple so you don't try this again. Young kid was too ambitious. Punk you came for his body! Stop! It's over. Let the kid take him. Let him. Take him and go! If I see two of you I'll kill you. It'll be some work carrying him home. Tae-soo. I thought I had nothing to lose. Cuz I didn't have anything... But I had you. Bro, I want to be mad at you. What happened to you. But I think it's too late that it hurts. Tae-soo, look at me. Tae-soo! Tae-soo! Tae-soo! Tae-soo! Tae-soo! Get him! Punk! Uh, get that bastard! Son-of-a-bitch! Kill him! Bastard. You bastard! Where did you go to get cigarette? Come back as soon as you get this message. And get me some ice-cream and bread. Bye. I had no dream but Romy. Right now I miss so many things. Hwan-gyu and Tae-soo and times with you... all of that feel like a beautiful dreams. Romy. I miss you. But I can't go back to you.
