--== McEphie ==-- We went fishing. She was wearing her lucky Beanie. It worked. She caught a huge halibut! It was a perfect day! That night she shot herself. In July 2014 this young girl from Nuuk shot herself because of a broken heart. Greenland, an autonomous country that is part of Denmark has the highest suicide rate in the world. And what is the most disturbing of this statistic is that is that it is the youth driving the numbers up. Greenland is now struggling to save the lives of a new generation of Inuit. Elaisa, you have to wait to get your prescription refilled. I need my Prozac. I can't sleep! I'm sorry. I can't help you. You have to consult with your doctor. - Dr. Lund! - Elaisa? I'm here at the pharmacy. They won't refill my prescription. - Sorry. - I'll be back Wednesday. But I can't wait until Wednesday! Come see me then so we can discuss it. Okay, Wednesday. I'll see you. Excuse me? Whoa... Oh, Pussy. Pussy. Let me help you. Thank you. Be careful, it's slippery. I was worried I wouldn't catch you. So, I ran. Elaisa. Svendsen. Mark Alvarez. Why? I'll be honest. You have something I want. What is it? Your Prozac. You don't have a prescription? I can pay for it. Is that even legal? I can't help you. I'm sorry. You don't understand. I can't sleep. I miss my husband. He died. I'm struggling. No, wait... Talk to your doctor. I did talk to my doctor. I'm going to see him Wednesday. I just need to get through the week! Unbelievable. Get out of the way. - What's your number? - Why? In case I need to call you. If I get into trouble. - Okay, here. - For giving you Prozac. Just call me. I got the Prozac. - [BANGING] - Oh, fuck... Please help me. My address is twelve... red house... Smells like Barrio Fiesta. Karl? Karl? Karl? [YELPS] Who's Karl? I'm sorry. I had to break in. I couldn't get in last night. I patched it up for now. What are you doing here? You called me last night. [GASPS] Shit, that was you? I'll be back with materials to fix the door. I'll buy them first from the hardware shop. I owe you so much already. I shouldn't have given you Prozac. I'm to blame. It's not your fault. It's mine. And it won't happen again. Definitely! I'm never giving you Prozac again. I knew it. You've got the wrong impression. I had no intention of killing myself. I just wanted to sleep. Well, you were out like a light. You were snoring so loud, I didn't wake you anymore. I was snoring? I didn't call an ambulance. I figured I'd let you sleep. You seemed fine. I stayed the night to make sure you were okay. Sorry, Mark. Thanks. Don't worry about it. We Filipinos should look out for each other. You should eat. Your adobo is delicious! - Leave some for me! - Hmm. [CHUCKLES] It's okay. You can have it all. Hmm. I miss this so much! Elaisa. I have to tell you something. Don't take it the wrong way. What is it? I think... I think... You need help. I don't need a Nanny. Then treat me as your friend. Do I have a choice? No. [BOTH LAUGHING] I had a little emergency last night. I just wanted to tell you about it. I was stupid. I took too many pills. But I'm okay now. Good thing Mark was there. Anyway... Not much going on. Just wanted to let you know. I guess I just miss you. Bye, Fred. ''Are you still awake?'' [BEEPING] [CLOCK TICKING] [WHIRRING] [WATER DRIPPING] [CELL PHONE RINGING] Mark? Hello! Elaisa, are you okay? Is something wrong? I can't go cold turkey. Can you give me just one? I'll replace it. I was hoping you'd realize you're better off without Prozac. After what happened to you. But I need one now! Ask me a question. Huh? Ask me a question! Are you giving me Prozac? Huh? No. Ask me anything but that. I don't know what to ask you. Okay, then I'll do the asking. What do you do? My husband owns a restaurant business. And you'll manage it now? No, I'm selling our shares. Why? I want to go back to the Philippines. For good? No, I won't survive there. But I have this idea for a business. You know, how Europeans visit the Philippines for the winter and book their lodgings online? I want to start my own booking site. There are a lot of booking sites. How will you compete? I'll offer bigger discounts. I just need to talk to the proprietors. That might work! I'll start with this resort we used to visit. I will focus on the Philippine Islands and beach destinations. I'm looking for shipping partners for my business. - [YAWNS] - Packed fish meat. Am I boring you? Are you busy Wednesday? Why? Please accompany me. To see the doctor. You can wait outside. What made you change your mind? If I can't get any medicine from you. I might as well go to the doctor. Whatever it takes. Okay, I'll go. Moral support. Thank you. You're welcome. It's time to sleep. Okay. Goodnight. You mean ''Good Morning''. Bye. We've stepped down your dosage by half. You're experiencing withdrawal from Prozac. It's normal. They'll fade. It's too much to handle. Can you refill my prescription? Yes, but avoid alcohol. You might relapse into depression. Can you take that without alcohol? Of course. You might call me again in the middle of the night. Let's have some coffee. My treat. Sure, where? Hm, since it is such a beautiful day, let's take a walk. I've seen almost everything around, don't you just wanna sit down? You know Hans Edge? Hans Edge? Come on, I'll introduce you to him. This is Hans Edge. He named the city ''Good Hope.'' In Greenlandic, Nuuk. How do you know this? My son Karl studied it in school. Where is Karl? I don't know. The last time we spoke he was angry with me. He fought with his girlfriend. He blames me for their break up. Girlfriend? Actually, girlfriends. There are so many of them. I got confused. I called Tessa 'Hanne' by mistake. I don't get it. The girls here behave like sluts. So, different from the Philippines. Here they walk around in their skimpy clothes. I told Karl to be careful or he might get sick. The kids here are either alcoholic or suicidal. You're a woman and that's how your mind works? No wonder Karl left you. You don't understand. You're not a parent. Whatever. - Elaisa... - Find someone else to talk to. You're the one who keeps calling. [CHIME TONE] What? [KEYBOARD CLACKING] Come home. [RINGING] Mom, wake up. Wake up, Mom. Mom! Wake up! Mom! Wake up! Mom! What's that on your head? Nothing. Is this your accident? Karl, you came. [DOOR BELL DINGING] Are you expecting somebody? Mom, this is for you! Mom, this man says he knows you. Shut the door, Karl, it's freezing. Uh, Elaisa, I'm sorry. What's that? - Are you guys dating? - Karl! What? You're being rude. I'm Mark. Why did you buy me flowers? What will my son think? Are you talking about me? No! Fine. I don't think I'm needed here. I'll leave you two lovebirds alone. Are you coming home? - Where have you been all this time? - At Andy's. You mean you've been here in Greenland all this time? And you never bothered to call me? I didn't want the drama. My stepdad Fred died because there was too much of it. - Karl! - See? Crazy Mom. - I wish you had died instead. - You're so rude! Hey, relax. That boy hurts my feelings. I'm sorry. This is embarrassing. - What I meant to say yesterday was– - No need to explain. It's difficult for any parent to do nothing when they see their kids making bad choices. You don't know what I am going through. You can't do anything if he doesn't want your help. But you have to take care of yourself. Have you eaten? I'm not hungry. I can stay if you want. I won't be a good company. Okay. Call me if you need anything. He'll be back. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] - Karl! - Hello! Meet your future wife, Maia. He's cute! Hi, Karl! Are you buying me a drink? Are these real? Asshole! - Don't make me throw you out! - Shut up! Chill! Sorry, I don't... [CELL PHONE RINGING] You're back. Hey. What have you really been up to, Karl? What do you care? I thought you had a job in Copenhagen and everything was okay. - It was. - What happened? I was tired of it. Tired of what? I just needed a break. So, how long are you staying? I don't know. What do you mean you don't know? You're an adult. You should know. - What are your plans... - Mom, I just got here! I'll probably stay for a week or two. And then what? Are you going back to Copenhagen? You know... I worry about you. Nuuk and you just don't mix. Mom, you told me I'm an adult. Then act like one! Mom, enough! Who's that guy? Nobody. I just met him. He's a Filipino. You like him? Mom, if you want him to stay, cut the drama. Hello! Elaisa! Hey! What's better? This one with dried berries or the mixed one? This one with berries. - Okay. - What's all this for? Something to snack on while fishing. Are you cooking for Karl? How are you two getting along? - Don't even ask about it. - [CHUCKLES] Why not? Is your fishing work-related? A stress-reliever. Oh, are you okay? Yeah. You and Karl can join me. I don't need the stress. Karl doesn't have to come. You deserve a break, you know. I'll pick you up tomorrow. - What time? - Early. - Okay. - Wait, I forgot to get sunblock. Okay. - Hello! - Hello! It's so quiet. That's why I like it. You're not scared to be all alone here? What if something happens to you? The sea is a dangerous place. Yeah. Of course, I'm scared. When I was a seaman, every time we embarked we had to do a fifteen-minute drill. We'd assemble beneath the lifeboats. One group to port and another to starboard. We'd do a roll call to make sure no one is missing. Everyone hated it. We thought it was useless. If the boat sank, it would be every man for himself, right? Right, I'd do the same. But when we had a real emergency and we heard that horn, it was like clockwork. I tell you, everyone was in his place when they did the roll call. No one panicked? Even if the boat sank we were already conditioned to do the drill. - I feel something... - Hey! - You got a bite! - What is it? Keep reeling that in. You're good at this. Yes. - There's more! - There you go, there you go. [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] - Apologize to Maia. - Who the fuck is Maia? That's me. Sorry I touched your boob. Who fucked you last time? - Asshole! Shut up! - Stop! Enough! Are you trying to get me fired? No, I'm fine! I don't want to go home! I want to dance! - You're going home! - Come on, Andy! Don't talk bullshit! - No, you're going home! - Enough! I'm calling your Mom! Come on, you! She'll give me a hard time! - Elaisa! - Asshole! Karl, stop! You shit! - Help! - You're a piece of shit! You're a piece of shit! I'll beat your ass next time! Let's go home. [WOMAN SPEAKING OVER RADIO] - [OMINOUS MUSIC PLAYING] - Karl, wait! [SIREN WAILING] Hey. Thank you. What are you watching? Viral videos. The usual. You know, that kid next door? He's only sixteen. How does a sixteen-year-old even plan his own death? What was he thinking? What made him pull the trigger? I don't know. I don't have much sympathy for suicides. They're so selfish. I pity their parents. They probably think it's their fault. They're probably thinking, ''If only I spent more time with him.'' ''If only I believed him when he said he was depressed.'' Are you okay? What else can you do if your love is not enough? [SINGING] Whoa! Hey! Do it right! You almost ran me over! Mark? Watch where you're going! - You could have killed me! - Karl! Are you okay? - Yeah, I'm fine. - Where are you going? I could use a drink. Hmm. I think I know a place. - Here you go. - Whoa! - Six-packs, huh? - Yeah. - Here you go. - Thank you. I actually wanted to talk to you. You should treat your Mom better. Maybe Mom and I should just live in the Philippines. It's always summer there. And I love the beaches. And the people are so friendly. When I was there, I ate so much. It was Karaoke night every night. And the girls! Oh, they were so pretty. It was paradise! You know, we're a happy people, Karl. The Philippines is a poor country. Here in Greenland, there's free education, medical benefits, welfare. In the Philippines you have to work really hard to provide for your family. The crime rate is really high because people will do anything to survive. You can get murdered there and the killer will most likely go free. I still wish I lived there. Anywhere but here. Really? Why? I don't fit here. When I was growing up, the other kids beat me up because I was different. They were mean to me. I only survived because I learned to fight. Did you tell your Mom? Mom's weird. She tries to but she can't get her own shit together. Greenland was a prison until I met this girl. She's also half-Filipino and she understood me. Then Mom fucked it up. Parents make mistakes. - Forgive her. - We broke up because of her! The girl she called a different name, huh? She told you? Go back to her. It's not that simple. There's an old Inuit fable about a Raven and a Goose. They fell in love in the summer. ''We are flying away soon,'' said the Goose. ''But I want to be with you,'' said the Raven. ''You can't swim, you'll die.'' ''Not if you carry me on your back,'' said the Raven. So, the Goose and the Raven made a pact. To cross the ocean together this way. But the Goose grew tired and she dropped the Raven off her back. The Raven flew next to her but he couldn't keep up. Then he saw an island. But the island was too far away. The Raven grew tired and fell into the water and drowned. Stupid Goose. I can't go back. That's really sad. - She must have been really special... - [SCOFFS] She's just one of those girls. Around here. I've probably fucked every girl in town. Yeah. I can't even remember her face. I don't believe you. You love her. Whatever. Denying it just makes it worse. She's not just a girl you fucked. I'll take you home. Yeah. Mark? Mark. Elaisa! Are you visiting someone here? I thought these were real. I'd love that, but real flowers won't survive here. Do you want company? Okay. I'm going back to Ilulissat. There's a big shipment I need to supervise. When? Monday. Come over to the house tomorrow. It's my turn to cook for you. I'll bring wine. I'll miss you. I'll miss you, too. [SOFT MUSIC PLAYING] Let's just enjoy this time. I want to show you something. Okay. Let's take a picture. It's my first time in an Anaana's house. Let's take a selfie. No, this is a better angle. Okay. Nice. Let me see. That's beautiful! How can anyone survive this? Can you even live here? Yes, I can... with you. - Ouch! - You're silly. I was kidding! Hey, that hurt! Wow. It's so claustrophobic. It's so cramped. I've seen enough. Think about it. Four families fit in there packed like sardines. A seal oil lamp was enough to keep them warm. Today people go home drunk and freeze to death. That's so ironic. I'm afraid Karl might freeze to death one day. Karl? Why in the world would that happen? Because he always comes home drunk. What if he falls asleep in the snow? You worry too much. Come on. Why don't you and Karl visit the Philippines? He told me how much he loved it there. - He did? - Uh-huh. Maybe you can start checking out contacts for your business. You're right. We might as well since we're there anyway. - Uh-huh. - Yeah. ♪ Oh yeah, oh yeah ♪ ♪ - Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah ♪ - [BOTH CHUCKLES] That smells good, Mom. Why are we having Christmas Roasts? I invited Mark over for dinner. He's leaving for Ilulissat on Monday. I wanted to make something special for you two. Hey, wait for Mark! Mark and I talked and he said that I should treat you better. He's right. What time is he coming? I'm hungry. Do you want to go to the Philippines with me? Serious? Just for a couple of weeks. When do we leave? Yeah. [CHUCKLING] [DOOR BELL DINGING] - Hey, come on in. - It's freezing! Guess what? What? I'm going to the Philippines. Really? Where are you guys going to the Philippines? It's called Dakak. There's this resort I want to check out. When? Soon. If possible. You know what, Karl, it's really, really hot there. You gotta be ready. It's like 40 degrees. - 40 Degrees? - You can say, ''Mainit.'' - Mainit. Say, ''Mainit.'' - Mainit? - What is that? - Hot. Mainit, hot. Mom, it's mainit. We're gonna die. [ALL LAUGH] - Do you know how to swim? - I'll learn. Take him to Siargao. Maybe you can come with us, huh? Yeah! You should come with us. I want to, but I can't. Maybe you can catch up? Yes, catch up! I wish. Balut! Feed him balut! - You know, Balut? - Yuck! - Balut. - Balut? You break it to make a hole. And you sip it. - Okay! - It's a duck embryo! Even I don't eat that. Gross! I mean, I can't wait. Cheers! How do you say 'cheers' in the Philippines? Cheers? ''Inuman na'' Be careful in the Philippines. I'm so full. Thank you! When you come back to Nuuk. Will you be staying longer? I still have to fix your window. Right. Stay with me? See you soon. Thank you. Give me your passport, Karl. Oh, shit. Where is it? Check your bag. I must have left it back home. What? Next. Passport, please. My son left his passport at home. Does he have time to get it? Check-in closes in 30 minutes. Can my Mom check in my luggage? No, sorry. - I'll just get my passport quickly. - Sorry. - Just go back home and get it. - Okay. - Hurry! - Yeah. I can't find it, Mom! Hang on. Mom, I found it. Thank god! Come on, we're boarding already! Hi, my son found his passport and he'll be here in 20 minutes. Can we wait for him? Sorry, that's not possible. I'll get my luggage and take the next flight. Mom? Mom! It's okay. It's my fault. You go ahead. There's no reason for you to miss your flight because of me. Take the next flight and follow. What about my luggage? I'll ask them to hold it here. Okay, Mom. I'm really sorry. Have a safe flight. You, too. Okay. - Can you hold his luggage? - Yeah. Okay. So, when is the next available flight? Mom, there's a blizzard here. All flights have been canceled. So, when can you come? I talked to the ticketing guy and they can't tell me anything. - I don't know. - Okay, let me talk to him. He's only going to tell you what I told you. Look at what you did! If you just stayed home. And didn't go out drinking with your buddies. This would never have happened! When are you gonna be more responsible, Karl? Mom, are we doing this now? We wasted so much money! And you always do this, Karl! You always mess things up! Fine. I don't want to go to the Philippines. Just get a flight! You can still come! You could still follow! Have a nice trip, Mom. - Hello! Hi! - Hello. Mrs. Elaisa Svendsen, welcome! What are you doing here? My job at Ilulissat finished early. So, I decided to surprise you! It is a surprise! How did you know I was staying here? Where's Karl? Oh, long story. He's back home. Thank you! - Welcome drinks, ma'am! - Thank you! Welcome, ma'am. He left his passport at home. Now there's a blizzard and he can't get a flight out. And he has the nerve to be angry at me. [WHOOPING] Nice! I feel kinda guilty. I feel bad because Karl is missing all of this. What's up with you and Karl? I thought you guys were okay. Now you're fighting again. I can't believe we're here. Just a few days ago we were in negative 20-degree weather. - I know, I know. - And now we're soaking up the sun. Yup. It's so beautiful here. What are you doing? The airport at Nuuk is open. Let's forget about Nuuk for a while. Come back to bed. Yeah. Mark? Mark? We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please check the number and dial again. Excuse me, did Mark Alvarez check out? - Let me see. - Thank you. Ma'am, we have no Mark Alvarez in our records. Are you sure? Can you check again? I'm sorry. We do not have a Mark Alvarez here. [BUSY TONE] We're sorry. Your call cannot be completed as dialed. Please check the number and dial again. Do you have vodka? Vodka, ma'am? Yes, why? Yes, ma'am, we do. [SOBBING] When's the next flight out to Nuuk? [UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING] Let me in. - Get your hands off me! - It's okay, I'll handle it. - Tell them to back off! - Why are you doing this, Karl? You're not my friend. You're a snake! You tried to steal Tessa! You wanted to fuck her! You didn't deserve her! Karl? Karl! Karl... Karl... Karl, don't do this! Help! Help! Come on... Help! Help! Help! Help us! My son! Help! Help! Help us! [SOMBER MUSIC PLAYING] [SOBBING] Karl? Mark? Sorry, I can't find any Mark Alvarez in our files. But he was here, over a month ago. He's Filipino, black hair? You gave him Prozac. I'm sorry. I can't remember. Excuse me. Hi. I'm looking for this guy. He came here to rent a boat last month? He's about... His name is Mark Alvarez. He's from Ilulissat. I don't remember the name. Do you have a picture? No, I don't have a picture. Do you remember the guy I was with? When I paid for my groceries? Yes... You were alone when you paid. There was no man. Are you sure? When I went... for groceries here... You were alone. Mark... [SOBS] Karl is gone. I know... I know. No, you don't! In the snow... His hand was out like that and he... He's gone! Where were you? I was looking for you everywhere! - It's okay. - Why did you leave me? Why did you leave me? Come here, come here... Here... have a drink. It's okay. I thought I was going crazy. I went looking for you everywhere. And I couldn't find you! I kept calling you but your phone was switched off. Where did you go, Mark? - Karl's dead. - I know... Have a drink. It's okay. It's okay. He was in the snow. I tried to revive him but... I couldn't take care of him! I went looking for you... I went everywhere looking for you. Where did you go? Mark... where were you? How did you get in my house? What did you do? Did you kill Karl? Help! Help! [GROANING] Help... help me... Are you okay? Let me help you. Come on. Be careful, it's slippery. Help! Help! We went fishing. She was wearing her lucky Beanie. It worked. She caught a huge halibut! It was a perfect day! That night she shot herself. In July 2014 this young girl from Nuuk shot herself because of a broken heart. Greenland, an autonomous country that is part of Denmark, has the highest suicide rate in the world. And what is the most disturbing of this statistic is that is that it is the youth driving the numbers up. Greenland is now struggling to save the lives of a new generation of Inuit. If I have any regrets. It would be that I wish. I could have raised her to be braver. She kept all of the sadness inside her. She never told me anything. Then it was too late. What else can you do if your love is not enough? What else can you do if your love is not enough? Hey! We were already conditioned to do the drill. Do you have a picture? Let's take a selfie. This is a better angle. Wait, I forgot sunblock. Do you remember the guy I was with when I paid for my groceries? You were alone. Would you rather talk to someone else? Karl, wait! How can a sixteen-year-old even plan his own death? I promise that those who caused her so much pain. Will never forget her. No! Pa, if you're watching this, I'm dead. I love you with all my heart. But I'm really tired. Sometimes I think things will be okay. But I hurt so bad inside. - I want it all to go away. - [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Open the door or I'll kick it in! Tessa! Tessa! I love you. Please! Believe me. I love you too, Karl. But your Mom, she said you were with Hanne! - Is it true? - You know, my Mom. Sometimes, she's so out of it... Sometimes, she forgets my name. So, it isn't true? You weren't with Hanne? You didn't sleep with her? Tessa, you're the one that I love. So, it is true! No, Hanne means nothing to me! You fucked her. I hate you! - Hanne means nothing to me! - Go fuck Hanne! - No! - Leave me alone! Hanne means nothing to me! Stop! Stop... Andy was right when he said that I'm better off with him! - Fuck this shit! - I'm so stupid! I should have fucked Andy instead! Go fuck Andy if you want! Fuck you! I'm going to kill myself! Go ahead. What are you waiting for? Kill yourself. You can't do it. You're so full of shit! Hanne is a better fuck than you anyway! Karl, this one's for you. I hate you.
