No idea! I thought they are your men. I thought they're your relatives. - Who are you? - Rajivan. - And you? - Aravindan. - Why are you here? - Looking for a job for him. What kind of job can he do? - He can dig wells. - And you? I don't know any job. - I can 'speech' Tamil well though. - Get out! "Will truth bloom in the water-course, would it?"

"A wedding on the earth, is one in the heavens too!" - Why are you late? - Blame "The messengers of god!" - Just couldn't leave! - Shall I serve dinner? I ate with them. If you keep eating out with the "Messengers of God" we'll be wasting whatever is cooked here. Have what I made tonight for breakfast tomorrow. "A thousand colours came along..." PA! Sleep over tonight. Have breakfast and leave. Why not! "And weaved beautiful raiments for them!" Why is there no sound on this? Oh Krishnan... what foolishness! That's not even the TV. It's the CCTV. Hey... hey! Let go off me! Thief! Thief! - Thief! Thief! - Someone's calling you. Thief! Thief! Excuse me, Sister. - What's going on? - A thief... - Oh! - jumped over the wall... and the dogs got him. Bit him! Oh... and? Happened a while back. I just got here. - Oh, okay. - People caught him then. Oh... Brother, hold this. Excuse me. Hold him tight. You break into an MLA's house?! Brother, listen to me. I didn't get in to rob. So you came to peep into their bedroom? You dog! - Hey, hold onto him! - Please don't hurt me... Ah, the police is here. He's losing blood! We should take him to the hospital. Just come with me. - Kannan Sir... what happened? - So... Sir, let me say it. We returned after the program at the temple festival. We were in our room, about to sleep. - You live here? - No, Sir! There was some dinner left over. So I asked them to stay for breakfast. - And? - So when I looked at the CCTV... I saw a shadow! When I looked through the window... - You see that wall? - Yes. He climbed over that wall and jumped in and... was sneaking by the wall towards the gate. So he got in at around that point... there... jumped over the wall, and sneaked towards the gate... Chances are that's how it happened. - Sir... I am not done. - Okay... then? By the time, me and Krishnan opened the door and came out He has grabbed onto 'Kingini's throat and is holding 'Painkili' under his feet. - Your kids? - No. They are our pet dogs. But they are like our kids, Sir. Rakesh is fine. But they are used to Kingini and Painkili! You can call him Rakesh. He is just a constable. - And then Mr. Kannan? - So... people gathered and then caught him. The PA's didn't do much. - But they hit him once and he fell. - Who is the PA? - Me. - Me! - Two PA's? - Sir, I am the PA. He is... PA Krishnan. P and A are his initials. - Rakesh... make a note of that. - Yes. Mr. Kannan, hope nothing was stolen. Some Gold or jewellery? - No. No, right? - No. Write down a statement... on a blank sheet of paper like a complaint and send it over to the police station. - Okay. - Rakesh, take care of that. - Yes, Sir. - Okay. Hello, excuse me. Don't worry, just making an arrest. For breaking into and entering the house of MLA Kunjikannan... and attempting a robbery, as per IPC sections 446 and 393 you are being arrested. You have the right to apply for bail through the court. Also, I have to by duty, inform a friend or relative. - Whom can I call? - Take me to a hospital, Sir. - I can't take this anymore! - Hey, Rakesh! What you are doing?! Sir, this is my first arrest. I was enacting CRPC sections 50 and 50 (A). I've an oracle ritual in the morning. Finish this... quick! Okay. Alright, everyone... leave now. Can't you all hear me? Go on now. Just go home, people. Quick, go on now. You think you are excluded? Now that we caught him for you, you want us out, huh! How about we give you an award right away? Stop screaming! I can't focus. Should've thought twice before trying to steal instead of crying shamelessly now. Half your ass is gone, my love. What is this even?! Was it a dog or a lion?! Never seen something like this in my entire nursing career. We'll have to change the dressing everyday. And forget about working for a while. He doesn't have a job. Picks up a gig whenever he feels like. Sir... I was not breaking in to steal! Mr. Rajivan, I drink 4 litres of herbal water everyday. Not cow piss. How about you say something sensible? And by the way... it's my first arrest. Don't complicate it, please! Sir... I didn't steal anything. I swear on my mother! Swear on your wife. Oh... we are not married. We are just lovers. Don't ask him to swear though. He will only fake swear. How many times have I told you... to never ever never ever never ever... steal! you swore... that you'll never ever never ever never ever... steal! That's why I agreed to have the baby! You cheated me! Don't yell in the hospital, correct? I was going to say... don't cry, child! But they are the same! Devi... don't do something stupid! You mean while changing diapers? I know how to do that. Go on. I'd like to get bail. Hey Policeman! Read. On Friday, December 7th, 2018... after midnight and before sunrise at a house in Cheemeni Panchayat, opposite Pallipara School... Adv. Krishnan... you do it. Attempted robbery at the MLA's house. Sections 393 and 446. But nothing was stolen Adv. Krishnan. Nobody was hurt. And there were no harmful weapons found. In my self defence, I grabbed 'Kingini's throat. That's all. 'Kingini'... is a dog sir. Please do not give him bail. He needs to be in remand. Sir... Section 393 is a false accusation. In fact, there is no evidence to support that I intended to steal. You know the sections of the penal code, huh! He has been to the courts so much that he has the experience of a magistrate. - He is a habitual offender. - What habitual! Sir, I cannot even walk. Half my ass is in the dog's mouth. - Do you have a lawyer? - No, I don't. - Do you want a lawyer? - No, I just want bail. This is a prescription. Should I buy you the medicines? No, I bought those already. On the other side. 'Her father is bed-ridden.' 'There is no one but me to change his diapers. I want bail.' You need a life sentence. Not bail. No Sir, please! An autorickshaw nearly crashed into me. I jumped to escape it. Please ask them to investigate. The name of the autorickshaw is 'With a thousand longing eyes'! The left side rearview mirror broke after crashing into a post. If they check, they will see it. Anyone to bail you out? No. How do I grant you bail without someone vouching for you? Let's do this. I'll grant you bail in your own name. Bring someone for bail in your next hearing. Yes, Sir. Hey Policeman! Investigate this, okay? What happened, Sir? - Is this yours? - Yes. Name? 'To hell with your evil eye, you Devil!' My name is Saji. Saji, does an auto named 'With a thousand longing eyes' - operate from here? - 'With a thousand longing eyes'... Not here. Maybe, check in the next stand. Were you in an accident or maybe a small crash recently? Nah, not recently. How did this happen? I broke it out of my frustration. But your auto doesn't run on petrol. Then why were you frustrated? - Yeah, it is electric. - Sir! It's a private auto that does not wait at the stand. Could you check the RT office? I'll check some workshops. Ah, let's do that. Let me know if you need anything. Sir? Do you have maybe 1000 rupees? For some household requirements. Why did you go to the market now? Because I don't know how to steal. Nobody will give us money for nothing. I have some money for emergencies. Stolen money won't bring us any good. Sir... Rajivan! You again? I told you we don't have work for you here. Don't you get it? I haven't gotten a job anywhere else, Sir. I don't want the police and such types coming for you here. Decent people work here. Please leave without making a scene. Sureshan... half of these are for Gopi's shop. The rest are to be delivered to Thampi's house. Okay. - Collect 1300 rupees from him. - Sure. Ah, Rajivan! Brother, can I have two packets of bread? Lalu, get me two packets of bread. Brother, do you think you'd have a job... I can do? What job Rajivan! I am barely making a living myself. Also, how can you work in this condition? Anyway, get better. We'll see. No, it's fine. ['With a thousand longing eyes'] "With a thousand longing eyes..." "I waited for you!" "For you my little birdie, that flew away from me..." "For you my sweet, beautiful birdie!" "With a thousand longing eyes..." "I waited for you!" "For you my little birdie, that flew away from me..." "For you my sweet, beautiful birdie!" "For you my sweet, beautiful birdie!" "Never felt the snow fall!" "Never knew when the sunshine came and went!" "My love... I spent my time..." "counting the days until the moment you'd come!" Birdie! Oh sweet birdie! Sureshan, a cup of tea? Brother, two teas please! Without sugar for Sureshan. Doesn't need any more, clearly! Sumalatha and I have been in love for quite a while. We don't do any public... display... uh Uh... fact... Affection? Yes, we don't do any of that. Please allow us to unite! Last Friday... were you on the Peringara road? Weren't you about to crash your auto into me? Huh? So... you aren't her elder brother? I got scared! Sir, I found the vehicle. Sir, that vehicle is my lifeline. I cannot hand it over. Your lifeline's ass... assessment needs to be done. Nothing to be assessed. Just my lifeline. Sureshan, in the jail you won't be able to meet your 'teacher'. Jail? You're taking it too far! Sir, I almost crashed into him. It's true. But I didn't! Attempted 'hit and run' is also a crime. IPC section-- Hey hey! Rakesh... let him speak. Yes Sir, this is what happened. After the Peringara Temple Festival, I was driving back... slowly. A milk truck struck me all of a sudden from behind. Another vehicle?! I lost control... and the vehicle steered towards him. I have no enmity towards this man otherwise. What is he saying! It is getting murkier. You take leave and go play the oracle! Don't work. What a mess! Sir, this case is not as complicated as you think. You stand that side and you here. This way. Sir, just... - You need me? - Just for a... Sir... this is the truck. That's the auto. This truck crashed onto this auto. The auto nearly crashed onto him. He jumped into the MLA's premises. The dog there... - Sir! - Ah! The dog there... shred him like a slice of bread! If it were so simple, why is there a fuss? It's a police station, Sir! There will be fuss! Everyone... leave. Come on. You get the jeep around. Go go! Sir, why are you... Be seated, Sir! Hey... what happened? Your case is done. Leave now. You're free to go. Go on... leave. - What is it? - Sir... Could you issue a signed document stating I have nothing to do with this case? - Like a clean chit? - What for? Sir, no woman will accept a man involved in a police case. Constable! Arrest this fellow. No, Sir! I'll explain things to her. But explaining things to you seems to be impossible! The police don't have a problem. Why do you have one? The child is growing in my belly. So I will have a problem! Transfer the child to my belly then! You've made sure I cannot step out. You can cheat me. Not the public. What do you want me to do? Bite the dog's ass in retaliation? The dog didn't do that without reason. Bite the ass of those who are responsible for it. Look... This baby cannot live within me as the child of a thief. But where else can it live? The child will live and grow within me only. But you can't live here. Cheemeni police station crime no. 912/2018. Srikanth Njendadi. Sir, he has been in the jail for 30 days. He just hit a cop once. He has been charged with IPC 332. He's mentally unwell now. Please grant him bail. First, ask him to change his clothes, get a hair cut and take a shower. I will then consider bail. Continue remand. But Sir... he has two little kids, he really needs the bail. They're better off with him not being home. Next. Sir, I have a complaint. They're refusing to accept it because it has spelling mistakes. Hey! Sit down. By the time I learn to write, the man will escape. You are here to increase my BP, are you? I've just taken medicines for it! Trying to create a mess in the morning! They say... the magistrate reaches out when God cannot. What? The magistrate reaches out when God cannot... is what they say. Hey policeman! The BP medicine thing I said... I meant that about you too. Examine his complaint and submit a report to me. Okay, Sir. Before I get transferred. Get it? Okay, Sir. [One month later] While returning home after the the Peringara temple festival on nearing MLA Kunjikannan's house I felt like relieving myself and was urinating there. Near the MLA's house there is a big pothole on the road. A cyclist fell into the pothole. A milk truck travelling behind the cyclist, swerved to avoid hitting him. The truck made slight contact with the auto travelling ahead. The autorickshaw driver lost control and came right at me and I jumped over the compound wall to save myself. The two dogs in the MLA's house bit me and tore into my flesh. The root cause for the dogs biting me... is the pothole on the road! But Rajivan... you first said the autorickshaw hitting you was the reason. Now you say, the pothole in the road is the reason for everything. 'False accusation and lack of evidence' is what the police are claiming. Where is the evidence? Where is the proof, Mister? That pothole is big enough to bury a man. What bigger proof do we need? The police are saying there is no evidence to what you are claiming. They probably... cannot see this either? Hey hey! Curtains down! Anyone can make up such a story. The police should also feel there is some merit to your claim. They need some proof for that. How about you leave now? Sir... please don't dismiss the case. - I'll bring you the proof. - What? 'I'll bring the proof' it seems! Does this look like a joke to you? No, Sir. I am serious. Are you sure? Firstly, decide against whom are you filing a case and give a complaint against him, I'll accept the case then. You may leave now. Next. Janaki abused me, Sir. What did she call you? How can I say that, I am on a sacred penance. Mrs. Janaki... what did you call her? I am also on penance. Weren't you on penance when you said it? I took the Lord's name, a holy dip and absolved myself. I'll have to face the Lord's wrath if I say it again. My dear good goddesses If you come here and just say... she abused me, how can I file a case... without knowing what she said? I can't say it but I can write it down. Okay, that works. Write it down. Hello? This is MLA Kunjikannan's wife Shubha. Yes Ma'am, tell me. The day the thief broke in here, we lost quite a few things. Mother***... ...goddess! Why didn't you say so before, Ma'am? We didn't notice it in the commotion. I'll send Madhu. Write down a complaint. Adv. Krishnan... if this case goes on like a never ending saga Mr. Kannan won't have time for anything else! Right, Ramesh? Well... but these days it doesn't take much to get embarrassed. Isn't it better... to just withdraw the case and let things be? Right Mr. Kannan? Who told you that it is us who'll get embarrassed by this case? It's not? What is it? Been trying to call you for a while. Mother Goddess is always available! What brings you to my doorstep, son? Things have been stolen from the MLA's house. What's missing? A suitcase full of documents, 1 lakh rupees and a collection of poems. A collection of poems were stolen? Mother Goddess has written many a ballad and lores! This won't go too far. It will return to your own house. "With deep sorrow... my heart sways!" Dad... "With deep sorrow within..." Dad, please stop. Let me write this. "With deep sorrow, sways my heart." "With deep sorrow within, comes another!" "What is within you, what is in your eye..." "is clear like a shard of glass!" With deep sorrow within, comes another man here! - Mr. Gangadharan? - Yes. I retired two years ago. I've studied law. So I thought I'll make use of the free time. So I became a lawyer. - Who's that? - Devi's Dad. I am Advocate Gangadharan. From Kuttamath. I was a Deputy Superintendent in the police. I now work as a lawyer at the Hosdurg court. I know your son-in-law since a long time. No thief bigger than him around! Long time back, he broke into my house. He stole a lot of law books. Despite being a cop, I never got them back. Nothing was thrown. They're all here. Well... the law has solutions for everything, right Rajivan? Rajivan! Rajivan... there seems to be an issue. Ah... Mr. Gangadharan! So... things are missing from the MLA's house. It's a very serious case now. There will have to be an arrest. They went missing so many days after the incident?! There is no law that says it cannot happen. Right, Sir? Not really. Ah... Sister... I have a gig early tomorrow. If you play games, nothing good will happen to you. Just tell us where the goods are. Sir! I never took anything. How about we do a silent search? - Rakesh? - Sir. Hold on, one moment! There are women in the house. Do you have a warrant? Nope. Mr. Gangadharan, don't get involved! Those in service only need to be worried about getting transferred. So I can get involved. - What must I do then? - Come back, quick. You went without a search warrant... - don't make it an issue. - So we'll return? Yes. Go to the court in the morning. Submit a report and obtain a warrant. We'll do the needful then. - Okay, Sir. - Okay. Honourable Court, on the 8th of last month, while I was returning from the Peringara Temple Festival near the boundary wall of MLA Kunjikannan's house... - Rajivan... - Yes? In the application for the court, you cannot use the word 'ass'. From now onwards, your ass shall be known as buttocks. Good to know. For the same case... arresting a person twice is unheard of. As of now, Rajivan's condition is bad from the dog's bite. If he is handed over to the police, they will torture him more. All I would like to tell the honourable court today is kindly examine the CCTV footage from the MLA's house. As soon as Rajivan jumped over the wall, the dogs got him. And soon after the people come in and pin him down. It's quite clear. Rajivan.. has not gone anywhere close to the house. How can there be charges for theft? This is an attempt to malign the validity of the private case filed by Rajivan. It's completely fabricated by the police. Sir! The things missing from the MLA's house are some extremely important documents, some books, and some money. Basically a suitcase with all these. Rajivan has some quirks. No matter where he breaks into, he always steals books too. Adv. Gangadharan knows that only too well. Therefore... Rajivan's house and the houses of those close to him should be allowed to be searched, Your Honour. What is this even! Search his house and the entire village! Rajivan's wife is pregnant. While her father... is unwell and bedridden since a long time. They don't have to conduct the search. The police will do it. You are making a joke of it! I am making a serious plea to the court. Adv. Gangadharan, what really is the problem if the search takes place? But... if the.. if they search the house they... shouldn't trouble his family and the search should be conducted in an orderly fashion. I request you to kindly instruct the police to do so. Did you hear that policeman? Search should be conducted properly and humanely. - Okay, Sir. - Search granted. There is just one another thing, Your Honour. The case filed by the MLA is an extension of the case filed Rajivan Therefore, I request that... both cases be heard together. How can that be possible? The cause of action is different in both cases. The two cases need to be tried separately. That isn't the case. The case filed by Rajivan will turn out to be the truth. Then, the case filed by the MLA will be a waste. On the other hand, for the sake of the argument, if we assume that the MLA wins the case, then Rajivan's case will be in vain. Therefore, won't it be better to hear the cases together? Why waste the respected court's time? Adv. Krishnan, does that not make sense? Yes? If the honourable court thinks so, and if Adv. Gangadharan too wishes the same, then sure. Okay. Rajivan... Did you rewrite and submit your complaint? Yes. The complainant Kozhummal Rajivan, aged 42, , a daily wage labourer hereby submits his complaint in the First Class Magistrate court, Hosdurg. Because of the pothole on Pallippara-Peringara Road an accident occurred on the night of December 7th. To save my life from the same, I had to jump the wall of the house in front of me. The dogs in the house bit me and caused serious injuries. The responsibility of the pothole on the road lies solely on the PWD Minister. So your complaint is against Minister KP Preman? You think you can just file a case against a minister? The minister is a public servant. To file a case against a minister, you need the approval of the cabinet. What kind of rule is that?! Did they take the approval of thieves to file a case against me? That's the law. Can we disobey it? You do this. See if you can get your job at the brick factory back. If not... find something else and continue your life. Go on now. Next. Nileshwaram police station... Crime Number... I told you the complaint will be dismissed. How about we get the approval? By the time you get the approval, your buttocks will be back to being your ass. Excuse me. [Kalliasseri] Just hold on... one second. Yes? My name is Rajivan, I am from Cheemeni. I would like to meet the Chief Minister. The CM does not live here. But when I enquired around, they said this was the house. Someone clearly took you for a ride. She was born here. But she lives in Thiruvananthapuram now. I had a complaint to give her. We don't accept complaints here. Please go to her office. Okay? Yeah, tell me. No, no. Somebody just came home... I don't have the health to go till Thiruvananthapuram. Rajivan, have some tea. Aunty will call now. Hi Aunty! Go ahead, talk. Hello Sister! Hello. What's so important that you went to my ancestral house? I had filed a complaint against a member of your government, Minister KP Preman. The court said they need your permission. Please allow it. What did he do to you? I took the oath of office 4 years back. And for 4 years, they have been after me. 'An uneducated man' 'a man who blabbers everything that comes to his mind, a snob' And many other things... they say about me. - Red Salute! - Why are they thirsty for my blood? My dear friends from the opposition party... I don't have enough blood to give you! And my blood isn't as tasty as you imagine! Where will the minister go after the event? Who are you? What's the matter? A dog bit me a few days back. I need to speak to him about it. Corruption cases, hate speech cases, - What is it called in English? - Hate speech! Ah! Yes. 'Hate speak'. And yes, there is a molestation case too. Do this. Take a blank sheet of paper. Write a complaint. Give it to the police station. I'll get the minister to call them. ...the media keeps digging these up and is after me! I am not sure that will help. My complaint is against him. ...and then they'll come up with another accusation! And what did Preman tell you when you went to meet him? I only have one thing to tell them all. Sue me! Down with Revathy Krishna, the dictator! Down with Revathy Krishna, the dictator! [3 months later - Petrol price Rs. 74.76] In a case where a young man Rajivan was bitten by a dog the cabinet has permitted the prosecution of PWD minister KP Preman. Rajivan claims he has incriminating evidence against the minister. There are state-wide protests against the decision. The protest by KCP party workers turned violent at various places. Effigies of the Chief Minister were burnt. To escape an accident caused by a pothole on the road, Rajivan jumped the wall of a house and the 2 dogs there bit him. Rajivan approached the court with a peculiar complaint that the PWD minister was responsible for the pothole. However, the cabinet approval for Minister KP Preman's prosecution has come as a complete surprise to many. When it comes to corruption and violence... ruling party or opposition party... becomes irrelevant to our party's agenda. The protesters and trouble-makers have no connections to Minister Preman. He has clarified multiple times that he is innocent. Therefore... when he is not afraid of the proceedings, others and the media need not be concerned for him. Get it? Those trying to disrupt the peace and harmony will be handled with force. This case is now in the courts. KP Preman and his party have the courage to face it. It is with that staunch belief that the permission to prosecute him has been granted. As for the rest... let the law take its course. It does take a woman to set things right! Mr. Rajivan... Mr. Rajivan... a moment please. How far are you willing to go in this legal battle for the common man? The ass is mine. Not the common man's. You are up against a minister. Do you think you can win? You are here with mics, That's a victory in itself. We will be at our homes if we lose the case too. Don't worry. Case no. 1899/2018. CC No. 926/2018. Witness No. 1 - Kozhummal Rajivan. What is this Adv. Gangadharan? The lawyer and the complainant are sitting together? Oh let the poor soul sit here! Poor soul? Tomorrow you'll seat him on the magistrate's chair. I am pleading my own case. Can't I sit here? Adv. Krishnan, what is your problem if he sits there? Sure, Sir. We don't have a problem. And I don't have a problem with them sitting here either. Where... is the accused KP Preman? The accused is absent, Your Honour. Filing absent petition. The minister has said what he had to. Your turn, Rajivan. Here, read this. I know it. I do swear in the name of God that what I shall state shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Begin. My name is Kozhummal Rajivan. A while back, I used to be a small time thief. I have been convicted in most of the cases. For the last two years, I never did anything wrong. I make an honest living. The night of the incident when I was returning home after the Peringara temple festival I felt like peeing. I was peeing on the wall of MLA Kunjikannan's house. Suddenly, an autorickshaw drifted and came right at me. In the spur of the moment, I got scared and jumped the wall. - And 'Kingini'... - 'Kingini' and 'Painkili'... got hold of... my... buttocks... and injured me seriously. I went through hell, Sir. I was once again labelled a thief. The public beat me up for a crime I never did. I can't work. To be frank... even to sit and take a shit-- What is this Rajivan? This is a court. Maintain some civility. Rajivan, kindly avoid the use of unparliamentary language. This is a serious office of the law. The newspapers said that I broke into steal... so I can't get a job anywhere! I am in deep trouble. The root cause for this is the minister. Are you done? Yes, now I am done. - Cross. - Sir... there is another case that is connected to this. Once the witnesses give their statements in that case, we'll do his cross. Announce the connected case. Cheemeni police station... Crime No. 1923/2018 accused Kozhummal Rajivan. Are there witnesses? Shubha Kunjikkannan. Shubha... didn't you file a complaint at the police station? Yes, I did. The incident that you mention in your complaint... do you remember the day, date, and time it took place? On the night of 2018 December 7th, at around 11 I woke up startled when 'Kingini' and 'Painkili' started barking. Didn't you go to check? No I was alone and afraid to. Did they bark after that? Around 1 AM again both 'Kingini' and 'Painkili' began barking loudly. That's when Kannan and I woke up. Since Mr. Kannan was there, you must have checked? Yes and we saw 'Kingini' and 'Painkili' biting the thief without letting him get away. Both the dogs were biting the thief? No, the thief had grabbed 'Kingini's throat. 'Painkili' had grabbed the thief biting him from behind. Can you recognise the thief? It was that man. Was anything stolen? A suitcase with extremely 'expensive documents', 1 lakh rupees, and a collection of poems I wrote. That's all. That's all. Cross. Sir.. it's too long to circle around from there. My legs can't take it any more. Can I go from here? Just go from somewhere, Rajivan! Have you seen the thief before this in person? No. How'd you know it was me then? The PA's told me. MLA's PAs, right? They'd know what a thief looks like! Earlier you said, you saw the thief when you stepped out. Now you say the PAs told you who the thief was. Right? When you saw the thief, did he have the suitcase in his hands? No. So... I did not take it that day! When you took it... is for the police to find out. The complaint you gave to the police states that you heard dogs bark non-stop at around 12 midnight and I got in at that time. Sir... the CCTV footage from the MLA's house will show us clearly that between 11 PM and 1 AM the dogs left their enclosure only once. That was when the MLA returned home. Throw that 'Kingini' out of the court. Bring him in only when his case is called. The suitcase that you claim was stolen... file... 1 lakh rupees... and your poetry... Neither has the police found it nor have they shown it to you for identifying it. Sir... there's no evidence in this case at all! Why am I being put to trial when I am sick and unwell? Shubha, you may leave. - He left? - A while back! Ah, there he is. What kind of lawyer are you?! When you put a witness on the stand you need train them on exactly what to say. I didn't expect her to panic like that, Shukoor! She writes poetry. So I thought she'd be courageous. You've made a mountain out of a 'dog-case'! Shukoor... in the witness list you've submitted is there even 1 person actually related to this case? I've no clue from where we're going to get punched! Be careful. There'll be more punches. Well... you be careful. Remember, the MLA has nothing to lose. Not the same with the minister, right? Hey Krishnan! What kind of talk is that! Rajivan, you've stopped stealing since what... three years? - Two years. - Two years. But you can't let go of the habit, can you? Rajivan quitting stealing is like Winston Churchill's story of quitting smoking. That he stopped stealing... is in itself a big lie! A while back... when Rajivan was about 30 years old he stopped stealing and joined Adv. Sadhanandan's office, that is Adv. Gangadharan's father's office... as a clerk. In the fourth month after he joined... for stealing the donation box at the Ramanthali temple the police arrested him. Right, Rajivan? - That wasn't me! - Yeah, right! The court convicted him. In a case where the courts found him guilty on the basis of evidence, he now claims he didn't do it. That's mocking the courts, Rajivan! This is a... copy of the judgment of your conviction. That may be marked as Exhibit B1, Your Honour. From the grounds of the Peringara Temple Festival... when did you leave that night? About 12:30. When you left... the MLA was still at the festival. Right? Did you see him there? Yes, I did. You were sure he wasn't at home, when you left towards his house? And somehow exactly when you neared his house, you felt like urinating. Despite there being smaller by-lanes around, he chose exactly the MLA's house to relieve himself. Seems like a convenient justification. When the rickshaw came at you, there was a lot of space around. But you didn't move away, instead you chose to jump over the wall into the MLA's house. Any particular reason... Rajivan? - Lord! - Sir...! How dare you behave like this in the court! You think you can do any nonsense here? Let go of him. Everyone sit. - Pushpa, you alright? - Yes, Sir. - Adv. Shukoor? - I am fine, Sir. Rajivan, this is your last warning. I will have you jailed. When I tried to hit him... why did Adv. Shukoor fall onto that woman? there is so much space around. Sir... we cannot encourage such hooliganism. It is inappropriate for our courts. They say... magistrates preside where Gods can't! Rajivan... you need to clean the court premises for three days. Sir... when a vehicle that has lost control came at me I didn't realise where I jumped to. I jumped over the wall in self-defence. Actions taken in self-defence cannot be termed as crimes. Doesn't that book say so? Right, Adv. Krishnan? Rajivan... you may answer verbally. I cannot accept your histrionics as evidence. Sir, it should not be on record. Sir, please don't put it on record. No, no. Sir, the CCTV footage presented in the MLA's case... should be examined as evidence in my complaint too. The exact time that I jumped you can see an autorickshaw passing me from behind. that is the auto of Sureshan. We need to bring him to court as soon as possible. Back! Smash it! Out! Vipin... you think Minister Preman will get trapped in this case? Keep those dreams to yourself. You guys can't do anything to our leader in the name of this case. You'll find a way to settle it. Or even kill the complainant. Isn't that your MO? No need for anyone to kill him. He'll die making trips to the court. Play. If you tell the dogs that they bit him because of the potholes even they'll be shocked! Say I threw a pot of hot water into the air, and it fell on someone who was walking under it, burning him. Can I claim that its not my fault that he chose to walk right there? In that case, so many accidents occur in Kerala should the minister be prosecuted for all of them? Who comes up with these new ideas! Hot water, it seems. Hey... did this accident happen because the driver dozed off? It was because of the pothole, right? - 5-3! - The law is the same for all. That's the CM's stand. How did Preman come into the picture? I don't get it. My dear Gopi... If a coconut tree in Vipin's yard grows and slants over my yard, and a coconut falls onto my roof causing damage from whom do I ask compensation? Vipin or his coconut tree? Me of course! But you wouldn't ask my father, right? I will ask your father! Your father brought you up to be like this. So I'll ask him too. Fine, ask him. But would you involve my uncle? I will! Your uncle got your mother married to your father! So, I'll ask him too! Why not! Prakash! No need to talk about his uncle. Why are you getting upset if I talk about his uncle. Why are you dragging his uncle into this? If someone's wrong, I don't care whose father or uncle it is! - What's your problem? - His uncle is my father! - So what should I do? - Talk about your own father! - What did you say?! - He and his example! Don't you dare touch me! Why did you bring his father into it! Let go of me! How dare you bring my father into this?! - Leave him! Let him go. - Guys, stop it! - Good Goddess! - How dare you bring my... [You can kill me, but not defeat me.] [4 Months later Petrol price - Rs. 75.07] I do swear in the name of God that what I shall state shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Ramakrishnan... Have you seen me anywhere? Yes, I have. - When? - At the Peringara Temple festival. "A wedding on the earth, is one in the heavens too!" Thief! Thief! Catch him! Don't let him get away. Stop right there! I told you to leave without doing anything. Hand it over! Give me the wallet! Leave! Go! Hey... we got it. This happened on the same day approximately 2 hours earlier. I helped him because I stopped stealing. I don't know this man otherwise. Evidence action section... Section... Uh... Section 54... states that previous bad character is not relevant. Right, Adv. Krishnan? For Adv. Shukoor and Adv. Krishnan I am a bad person. But there are people, who can vouch that I am a good person. Make way, please! MLA Kunjikkannan and his group are arriving at Minister KP Preman's residence for an urgent meeting as we speak. The PWD minister has released a statement saying the courts should be questioned for accepting such a baseless case. He also said that people who say rubbish for publicity stunts should not be given such importance in the media. Don't dream that you can force me to resign with such tactics, he added. The opposition leader retorted that this case would be the iceberg... ...against which the KCP ship would crash and sink. Riyas KMR reporting from Kanhangad with cameraman KP Santhosh. This... is not something to be scared of. They're doing this because of the upcoming election. It's just a minor case. 100 percent. Kunjikkannan... You've brought this 'dog-case' upon me in an attempt to usurp me, right? Oh my goodness! Will I ever do that? Can a thief really bring you down? We'll see if that happens. Right, Chandran? 100 percent. Don't take it so lightly either. Makes no difference to the court if you are a thief or a minister. The procedure is the same for everyone. If his position is so fragile, he'd rather let it go, Shukoor! Someone's pulling some strings from outside. And playing some tricks to bring Mr. Preman down. You should be careful. - Right Chandran? - Yes! If he resigns, then you become the minister, right Kunjikkannan? The party has only 2 MLA's, right? Become a minister by taking him down?! Not for me! No way! Oh... so why did you become an MLA? To make Tik-Tok videos? - Sureshan Kaavunthazhe? - Yes? Please accept this. What is it? Did the teacher send it? No, the court sent it. It's a Summons. - Yuck! - Please sign here. - What is that? - CRPC Chapter 6 (3). - What does that mean? - Be in court on April 1st. - April 1st? - Yes. April 1st, does not work for me. I have a date with the teacher. - Take someone else. - Someone else? Another section will be charged then. IPC 419. - Impersonation. - That's a crime? Of course. I don't have a coat to wear to the court! CMP 1899/2018 CC No. 926/2018 Cheemeni Crime No. 17/2018 Witness No. 2 Sureshan Kaavunthazhe. I do swear in the name of God that what I shall state shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Sureshan Kaavunthazhe... Right? Yes. And you are the magistrate... right? Cross! Sureshan, how fast were you driving that night? 20... maybe 25 Kph. The speed limit there is 60. Yes. And there were no issues with your vehicle? None. Were there other vehicles on the road? No. Why were you going so slowly, Sureshan? No reason, huh? For this story you made up and told the court How much money did Rajivan give you? Hey... I don't have money to take her to the hospital. And you think I can pay him? Don't speak nonsense. Why don't you say everything yourself and let the witness go? Rajivan... stop the bickering. Sit. I know you don't have money to take her to the hospital and that's why you were stealing. I can prove it without your help. Sureshan... who was travelling in the auto that night? - Me! - Only you? Sir, if we check the CCTV footage submitted... we can clearly see there was someone else in the auto. We should examine that. Sir... Rajivan, Sureshan, and another person have together conspired to do this. Rajivan went from behind stole the suitcase and gave it to Sureshan. Then when they returned... - is when the MLA's dogs-- - 'Kingini' and 'Painkili'... grabbed Rajivan. The second witness Sureshan should not be approved. The honourable court should charge him for perjury. Why are we here? We have something to discuss. Come. I have deliveries to make for the bakery. I need to go. That's a lot of stairs. My BP will rise if I climb up. Your BP will come down if you climb up, Sureshan! I told you to not involve me in this. My love life will be affected by this. You won't understand the frustration of an unmarried auto driver. We'll get you married. Just come on in. I won't let you go without telling us who was with you. The person will have to come to the court. Must you really win by dragging a poor girl into court?! Sureshan... are they the thief and his girlfriend you were talking about? He does talk about you a lot. That you aren't married, but are living together and you're pregnant... And because of that he keeps asking me to take leave! Sureshan... Rajivan! - Hey! - Hey! - Isn't that Sureshan? - Yes. What happened? Did your auto crash into something again? No. He fell off the stairs. At least that's not a crime. - How come you're here? - You must have read... about the murder on the shuttle court. The whole team is here. Been a couple of days right? Yes, it's been 2-3 days. But the accused and the witnesses were unconscious. Can't question them if they are unconscious. I'll see you later. Lot's of work to do. They need to be discharged. Presented in the court and file CRPC-- 54? - Brilliant! Okay then... - See you. Teacher, we need a favour from you. Please come to the court once. To the court? Me?! I can't, Sureshan! I told you she wouldn't. This teacher isn't interested in the rebuilding of the nation. Teacher... you only want to look ahead in life. But also look at his 'behind'. Or think of this child growing inside of me. Okay, I will come. I am with you for the rebuilding of the nation. But I have a condition. I do swear that I will only present the truth. Sumalatha... where did you both go so late at night? For a couple who have decided to unite is there a place more comfortable than their own auto? I was in no hurry to go home. Neither was he. So he drove the auto very slowly. 20-25 Kph. Sureshan doesn't have to drive at this lawyer's convenience, does he?! Sureshan is very caring. That's his style. 'Slow-steady wins the race', that's my style. Slow down! I need to make notes! Sorry, Sir. Sir, I had requested to not accept this witness. But I should be! She's wasting our precious time, Sir. No, Sir! I've submitted a 45-second video of me and Sureshan as evidence. Please examine it, Sir. Prosecution Exhibit No. 6. "Did the breeze kiss you?" "Birdie... sweet birdie!" "Did the little dragonfly play the sitar?" "Birdie... sweet birdie!" Sureshan! Oh God! "Did the peacock in you dance" "with the blue feathers out waving?" "Birdie... sweet birdie!" "Birdie... sweet birdie!" "The yellow flower that" "bloomed in my memories, won't you return?" "Having flown away from me," the bliss of my life, won't you return?" "With a thousand longing eyes..." "I waited for you!" "For you my little birdie, that flew away from me..." "For you my sweet beautiful birdie!" "Birdie... sweet birdie!" My name is Johnny David Puliyamveedu. I live near Cherupuzha. I am a tempo truck driver. I drive milk around. Have you seen me ever before December 7th? No, I haven't. Can you tell us what happened on the night of December 7th? On the night of December 7th... Johnny... which is me was on his way to pick up the milk from the farmers. Right in front of Pallippara school a cyclist fell onto the road, like Bam! - Did you run him over? - No! Johnny... which is me, took the lord's name... and swerved to the right! The vehicle skidded. - Why did you stop? - Did you write it down? I can do my job! You do yours! Sir, one mistake of yours... can lead me to the gallows! Johnny! Johnny... which is me, loves to talk! The magistrate won't get it wrong. Tell us the rest. So... the vehicle is now skidding towards the right. A Bullet Motorbike is headed my way in full speed. Johnny took St. Alphonsa's name and swerved to the left but to my bad luck the truck scraped the auto just ahead of me. - And then? - And then what...! Things got out of the auto guy's hands. and Johnny... me again, got out of there! To be frank, I am the fearful type. How did the cyclist fall? Oh that you should ask him. That was a wide road. Why did he have to fall into that pothole?! Sir... Johnny means there was a pothole on the road. There was! But they have covered it now. Cross. - Johnny David, right? - Yes. And you are from Pala? Yes, but my family moved here during my grandfather's time. Johnny, do you use any narcotic substances? In the name of St. Antony! Who's spreading these lies? Do you encourage people to use them? - Nah! - No? Johnny... which is you, has two cases to his name. - Really? - Aren't there? There are. One registered in the Nileshwaram Police station in 2014. For over-speeding. And in 2015 at the Hosdurg police station... for selling banned substances? Is that even a real case?! Sir, Johnny is saying that this isn't even a case! Sir, every night... Johnny leaves from his house at Cherupuzha - and drives to Cheruvathur. - Yes. - Gets there by 1 a.m. - Correct. From then... till 3 a.m. early morning... he meets migrant labourers. He has a regular set of customers. And distributes banned substances like Hans and other Ghutka products. After that, from the dairy farmers between Cheemeni to Panathur - Johnny collects Milk. - Correct. He then drops off the milk at the Panathur Milk Society. After that he heads to the Karnataka Border area Chemberi... from where he buys these substances hides them in the empty milk containers and returns to Cherupuzha. This is Johnny's... daily schedule, correct? December 7th, on the night you saw the incident was there Hans hidden in your milk containers? Yes. - Johnny... - Yes? From your house in Cherupuzha, till Cheruvathur - it is what 28-30 km away? - Yes, yes. Normally, how much time does it take? Takes about 30-35 mins. On the night of the incident, December 7th that is... you were a little late to leave, correct? That night, you left only after 12:40. Correct? Sir, the footage from the MLA's house was submitted as evidence earlier. Zakaria lives next door to Johnny. The CCTV footage was from his house was submitted today. From the two CCTV footages, one thing can be inferred. Generally... Johnny starts from Cherupuzha at 12:30. On the night of the incident, he left after 12:40. To reach Cheemeni at 1, he would've had to drive really fast. The rash driving caused by his over-speeding lead to his crash with Sureshan's auto. This case... is simply not about the road. The rest is Rajivan's and Johnny's imagination. That's all, Your Honour. - Didn't expect this, did you? - No. My good Sir... Can I just be frank? I make rupees 40 on a pack of Hans. If I sell 100 a day, I make 4000. 4000 multiplied by 25... that's nearly a Lakh a month. If the police get me, and I am fined about 20000 rupees... I still make about 80000. That's why I do this. What can one really make from milk anyway? 1800 a day at best! That's all. Do you have any idea what you're saying? If I put this on your record, you will be in jail forever. Oh no, Sir. Milk is my main business. - the other one is a side hustle! - Hey! Move him to a side now. Rajivan do not bring such witnesses here! What did you think the court is, a stage for your drama? Stop wasting our time. The next hearing will be on June 3rd. Rajivan, your witnesses are okay. But regardless of what they say, the buck will stop at Engineer Samuel or the contractor. It won't go beyond them. Didn't mean to dishearten you. Right now you are a thief who tried to break into the MLA's house. The truth about how you reached the MLA's house and why the dogs bit you, should be proven. We have to win this case somehow. Instead of wasting our time running after the MLA and the minister, let's pin the case on Samuel... the government engineer. And the minister? Did the minister dig the pothole? Isn't your wife convinced of your innocence? Aren't you? - I know he's innocent. - Then, what's the problem? Then why was he beaten up? Why did he go to jail? If you listen to him and stop with Samuel you're done for. Get out of the way, please. Long live the labour union! Long live the labour union! Long live the labour union! Long live the labour union! Who is it? Is Mr. Samuel at home? No, he has gone to Thrissur. Okay then. I'll come tomorrow. But he'll be back only in a week. Tell him a Rajivan had come to meet him. It was about a court case. Okay. Rajivan, stop! Where are you off to? Of course, he is a crook. He built that road after all. Did you see him? What did he say? Don't think he will come. Was hiding inside. - What? - He was hiding, he won't come. He should be there. In that case... let's add him as an accused and deliver a summons. - Should we mess him up like that? - If not, you're done for. You'll get thrown under the bus and so will your case. This is indeed a messed up case. In my Dad's time... if we'd gotten such a case he would have made a spectacle out of it. You know? Rajivan, what are you looking at? Gangadharan... See this? The video Sumalatha shot in the auto. There is a motorcyclist passing by. Let's find him. KL 60 N 6072... The trouble caused by a video call still hasn't died down. This case is politically charged. It's not right for me to interfere. Please don't involve me. Please Sir! Don't say that. All you need to do is come to the court once. To the court? Never. Find another way. Also, my date of return is fixed. You are studying law. But you haven't learnt much, have you? How about you check in when I am done with my course? And that's why I've booked my return ticket. You can leave. Let's leave I guess? What if we request to move up the date of hearing? Please don't come here again for this. What are we waiting here for? We travelled all the way from Cheemeni, and burnt so much fuel! For what?! Come on now. In my father's ancestral house, there was a huge mango tree. A really large one... the trunk as thick as an elephant! That big. The mangoes used to be so high up, that our stone throws would barely reach it. - What happened? - Think we ran out of petrol. What do we do now? You've been pushing me around for a while. Push the car now! Devi close the doors! Gangadharan, call the cops! "From across the 14 worlds..." "O deities that know it all through your inner eyes!" "The flame has spread, it's all over the body now." "O holy ballads that drown all sorrows!" "Keep it going on..." "until victory is yours, your rebellion!" "Rise up! Spirited!" "This ammunition, take it in your arms! Agitate, let us!" "Fists must go up! Forward and always!" "Armaments... there are none!" "In this battle, you cannot fall, march on!" "By the beats of the wave, swing on!" "Be the eye, see them traps ahead!" You! Stop right there! "Is that a dark tunnel on the way?" "Are those tales of old, on the mind?" "Are those knots of dread, on the body?!" "Weary trials and tribulations, are all over the world!" "That's a prison, right up ahead!" "A dungeon that's flaming inside!" "This fight, this dance, without it, what'd be left of us?!" "When the steps go pacing faster" "when the strategies all have to alter" "this chariot race, without it, what'd be our fate?" "Armaments... there are none!" "In this battle, you cannot fall march on!" "By the beats of the wave, swing on!" "Be the eye, see them traps ahead!" "Sounds of the anklet that fill up the ears" "and banks of the beautiful Kavvayi river, join in!" "Keep it going on..." "until victory is yours, your rebellion!" "Rise up! Spirited!" "This ammunition, take it in your arms! Agitate, let us!" "Fists must go up! Forward and always!" "Armaments... there are none!" "In this battle, you cannot fall, march on!" "By the beats of the wave, swing on!" "Be the eye, see them traps ahead!" Don't move, okay! We won't get paid if they think we aren't good! I think they are from the committee. Ganging up on one guy!? Get away, guys. Hey! Stop it. Leave him alone. Stop this hooliganism in the church premises, or I'll call the cops. - Hey, let's get out of here. - Leave! Are you okay? Can you get up? Want some water? Hold on. Slowly! Take it easy. They didn't come to kill you. The ones who come to kill, will definitely kill! This was meant to scare you. Well, it's very important for them that I don't die. And lower him... slowly. - Sorry to have troubled you. - No, not at all! 'Be kind and be efficient' that's our motto! By the way... do include some solid food items like Beef and Parottas in your diet. You won't have to change your diapers often. Beef is cheaper than diapers! Right? Sweetheart... What happened? Who were they? It's nothing. They were trying to scare me. You are saying nothing, but your face is all swollen. - I am fine. - Hope nothing happened. What could happen? He is used to it now. Can't let it go. We should file a case for this too. On blank sheet of paper, write down a complaint and... Rakesh... no more complaints. We've stopped doing that. - Rajivan! - Yes? The case is done, I guess? They realized it and so sent men to beat you up. Could've been to kill you even. - What is it? - Shall we leave? We're to? You are off to the airport, right? We'll drop you. - No thanks, I've booked a taxi. - No need of that. We can go in my car. - Just fill up the fuel. - Hey! No. The route to the airport is blocked. I know a shortcut. I don't need that. What is this? I'll call the police! The police will come even if I call them. No need of that. Sir, will come with us. We'll go in my car. Fine, don't fill petrol also. - What nonsense is this! - Let us drop you! Good Morning, Sir! Relatives don't want you to leave? Open the boot. Lord Anjaneya! Just drive, man! Sir... one of your relatives is behind the car. - Hey... what are you doing? - Get up, Brother. If you plan to go anywhere other than the court. you'll have to drive over my body. Why can't you understand? I can't come. Since matters have come this far Raghu, you're going to the court before you go anywhere else. Sir, I already arrived late. If you delay it anymore, you will miss your flight. Unless the flight also gets delayed. Get lost, man. Raghu isn't going anywhere. Open the boot. I'll take the bus. Raghu Sir... At this age, if I am not afraid of going to the court, why should a law student like you be? That man is unable to live peacefully. This is your last chance to do good. Otherwise, all 3 of us will die. The minister will kill him after the case. Instead of putting an 'RIP' status on social media after he dies why don't you just come to the court? I saw that accident. And I really want to help you. But I have been told to not utter a word about this anymore. If the CM's nephew is being threatened, imagine our situation. They'll kill us on the streets, Sir! This guy might be able to help you. Your Honour, this case has been going on for a long time. If they are introducing new evidence and witnesses at this stage it just means, they are manipulated. Sir... ever since this case began, everyone has been asking where is the evidence? where are the witnesses? Right? Haven't you asked? It's bloody disgusting of you to say that they are unacceptable now! Sir, what is this? Whose responsibility is it to maintain decorum in the courts? Rajivan! Don't give me a bad name! I have warned you a couple of times. I will throw you out the next time. I am building the evidence that the police is supposed to. I said that out of my frustration. Sir... he says he's 'building' the evidence. Your Honour, you are well aware that in this case the complainant's evidence closed long back. My humble submission... please don't accept a new evidence at this stage, which is irrelevant. And the complainant himself stated before this court that he has fabricated the evidence. But Adv. Shukoor... why are you scaring him by talking in English? He does not know the ways of the court. But we can accept the evidence, can't we? No, Sir. You took the same stand in Sumalatha's case. It's not right, Sir. Rajivan, did you hear that? This is your last chance. There will be no more opportunities. Next hearing, July 16th. Sir... 16th is her due date. if the case can finish by then, it will be a big relief. Sir, are you going to preside over the case at his convenience too? But why not, Sir? I need to know he is innocent before the baby is born. Hey! Sit down. Do you think the court functions as per your wishes? Can we decide the proceedings here based on your delivery date? The hearing will be on 16th. But why is that, Sir? You moved the dates when the minister was unwell. Can't do the same in my case? Shukoor... - Sir... - Preman must come. Don't make me issue a warrant. Sir, he is a minister. So what? Will I gobble him up? Until this case is over, this lady is not permitted on the court premises. Pushpa... I am out of almonds. I do swear in the name of God that what I shall state shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. - I do swear in the name... - Hey stop! In one language... will do! Sir, I can... Rajivan! Enough. Just tell your name and address. Akash Kunjikann, Mahadevagramam 670307. - What do you do? - I am a biker. - A mechanic? - No Sir, with the bike-- Hey hey! Not you. Let him speak. Sir, I travel the world on my bike. That's my profession. - It doesn't need fuel? - It needs, Sir! Petrol is so expensive now! Keeps rising everyday! It's 75 now. Increased 75 paise today. Can you do something, Sir? Business is down! 'Everything will be set right' that was their motto, right? Let's see! You begin. Sir, me and about 6-7 biker friends were returning from a Himalayan bike trip. On December 1st, we started from Kasol. It takes about 6-7 days from Kasol. Kunjikannan... To get from the Himalayas till here takes a lot of time! For now, tell us what you saw on December 7th near the MLA's house. Okay... about 20 metres from the MLA's house there is a wayside eatery. Generally on our way back from trips, we stop there for food. - Did you stop there that night? - Yes, I did. From there I had... 4 Parottas and a duck roast, since beef had finished and since I didn't have money for grape juice, a black tea. I told him I'll pay later and was waiting for my friends. At that point I saw a tempo truck approaching from a distance. A little ahead of the truck, a poor cyclist rode over a pothole and fell. The truck behind him swerved to the right to avoid hitting him. But then a motorbike was travelling towards them from the opposite side. In order to avoid hitting him, the truck swerved to the left. And the truck scraped the rear of the auto just ahead of it. The auto rickshaw lost control and scraped a lamp post a little ahead. The truck and the auto left without stopping. Sir... the petrol cost... is there anyway you can reduce it? At least 5 rupees? It's a girl! Sir... it's a girl. That's good to hear. What else do you need? The... A name for the child? Cross. Akash... in December is it cold in the Himalayas? Yes, it is about minus 8. Lot of snow there, I guess. Only in some places. I bought some in a small jar. Akash, if you get snow from there won't it melt by the time you get here? You can put it into the freezer. Same impact. Akash Kunjikann... why did you choose this profession? I will take that question. One day, I just realised that my name suits a biker. I had a couple of tattoos too. When I got the entire arm tattooed, things got interesting! And that's how I chose this profession. Akash, do you smoke? - Yes, I do. - Do you smoke Ganja? Only if it is good stuff. Since you were returning from the Himalayas, you must have smoked that evening? Sir! It's wrong to assume that all those coming from Himalayas smoke up. True! The Ganges comes from the Himalayas, does it smoke up? I never asked if Ganga smoked up. I asked if you did. Answer that! I did. Sir... that night he was under the influence of drugs. He must have been hallucinating. He is telling us his imaginations. He never saw it and probably wasn't even there! Sir... only I smoked up. My helmet camera did not. Akash... back then in December... all those who came with you on the trip have jobs except you. Yes, they do. They're my hope. Buddy... 'Hope' is a nice name. Name your kid Hope. Hey! Just answer the questions. Do you know where you are? Sir... what is this? Isn't this the court? Behave yourself while in court. Get it? Sorry. You proceed. Rajivan... 'Hope' is indeed a good name. Sir! What is this? - Are you also mocking the court? - Sorry! - You continue. - I lost my flow. I am done. That's all. Don't get angry Adv. Shukoor. You've said so much nonsense here. Am I not listening to that? Anyway, forget that. Why isn't KP Preman present? Sir... he has a back-ache. He is unable to travel. A back-ache? You think I don't have one? But I am here! In the court. He is attending weddings, laying foundation stones campaigning for the election too. He's fine then. Gets a back-ache when he has to come here? His wife has just delivered a baby. Yet, he is here everyday. A woman 9 months pregnant could come to the court. What trouble does KP Preman have that is worse than hers? Sir, he is the minister of state. What minister! That he is in the legislative assembly. Here he is an accused. What's that dock there for? For decoration? - Arrest him and present him! - Sir! Issue warrant. Sir... In such situations... we sacrifice someone and get away. You mean me, right? You won't be alone, Contractor. The private secretaries too. The minister is needed for our future. Not the case with you. Put this on his head. Mr. Preman should we hire a better lawyer? - Isn't that smarter? - Not needed, Sir. We can close this case at the next hearing. You wouldn't have to come to the court again. This may not have created flutters within the ministry but this is an interesting thought placed before the justice system. It's an amusing point that a common man Rajivan has put forth to the court. He has brought forward the important issue of 'root cause'. This case is progressing at a quick pace, which is rare with our courts. The promptness shown in issuing a stay order against withholding salaries, or the immediacy shown in the liquor ban case and the temple entry cases, is now being shown in a case where a dog bit a man. It's a relief that courts are functioning at such speeds. The statement and evidence given by Akash Kunjikann have now made it imperative for KP Preman to appear in court. Preman Sir... the BBC are here! See? Hmm, the case might be minor, but the publicity is major! CMP 1899/2018 CC No. 926/2018 Accused No. 1 KP Preman. Preman Sir! Hello! Hello, Sir! - Been busy? - A bit. You know how busy a politician can get. Yeah. - Also, a by-election is coming up. - True. - Are you afraid to stand alone? - Uh, no. Also, I am never alone. I am generally part of one of the coalitions. No, I mean are you afraid to stand alone there in the dock? No, Sir. Then ask your bodyguards to leave. Out you go. Hey... who do you think will take your chair? Call it. Prosecution witness no. 8 Samuel Pulliyullaveettil. Engineer Samuel... I guess you know some law. Yes, he does. Just like you know how to build a road. - Shut up! - What! Sir... he interferes at every point. What is this behaviour?! Sit down, Man! Samuel... about this Pallippara-Peringara road the work was handed out after issuing a tender. Yes. Usually in PWD contracts maintenance work is the responsibility of the company that takes the contract. Maintenance clause was not put in the contract. Why was the maintenance clause not put in the contract? That's what I am trying to ask. That was because... Minister... KP Preman called and told to remove it. The minister called you directly? The minister did not call himself. The private secretary called. He said the minister asked him to. Oh! So the minister told the PS, and he called you. And you removed the maintenance clause from the contract. Correct? Yes. Didn't you commit a big offence? - Right? - Yes, Sir. Sir... the responsibility of a road rather the responsibility of accidents occurring due to bad quality roads is solely that of the PWD Engineer. Sir, this case should be filed against this man. He should be the first accused in this case. Sir, why is such a senior minister put on the dock like this! Rajivan... Samuel will have to be on the accused list. Otherwise, the case won't move forward. I don't mind being an accused in this case. Won't make a difference even if you did. What you did... is a big offence! According to CRPC Section 319, Samuel Pulliyullaveettil is ordered to be Accused No. 2 by this court. Well, weren't we waiting for him to come? The witness became the accused! How was that?! Sir, I have a request. What is it, Samuel? Sir, I'd like to turn approver. Kindly allow me as an accused to depose as a prosecution witness. But you will have to file an application. We have the application, Sir. I have filed a petition. You are appearing for him too? From... just about now. Very well then! Any objections? Begin. Sir... I have been holding the post of the PWD Engineer for the last 16 years. During the time, I have been transferred 18 times. In the last four years, there are have been very few transfers. Just two... in fact. That is because... as per the minister's wishes I started altering the contracts to benefit the contractors. That is the only reason why the transfers reduced. I am not looking forward to getting the government's pension. I mean I haven't really worked enough for that. Frankly because... he has not let me work peacefully for a single day. For his relatives, for his party, his supporters and for his personal needs, he made me siphon money from government funds. He made me sign documents to facilitate such transactions. - What is this, Sir! - Shukoor, sit down. I'll ask him. Samuel... There is no point blabbering in court. - Do you have evidence for this? - Yes, we do. Strong and relevant evidence. Let me present them one by one. For the last 16 years, while he was working many of the contracts that he drew up were asked to be modified. The instructions to do so sent by various private secretaries are attached herewith. To alter the maintenance clause in the contract for the road where the accident took place the Minister drafted a new contract. Here is the original. At that time, the minister, his personal assistant, and his personal secretaries all have made calls to the Engineer. Here are the phone call records, incoming and outgoing. During the construction of Pallipara-Peringara Road an analysis report found its quality to be inadequate. Here's a copy of the report. The minister may have destroyed the original. After the road where the accident took place was built the public filed a number of complaints against the bad quality. Also, there are 32 complaints filed regarding the very pothole that led to Rajivan being bitten by the dogs. Here is the order to halt the repair work citing lack of funds. Sir, is this a case trial or a street play? Nonsense drama! While submitting evidence in the court, one must share the evidence with the defence. He doesn't seem to have a basic understanding of legal procedure. Eh... but then Samuel wasn't an accused earlier. The documents can be presented only now. It's not that, Sir. The moment Rajivan decided to bring Samuel to the court as a witness they realised Samuel would turn into an accused. Isn't that why he came to the court today with a Section 315 petition and a sack full of evidence. This a pre-planned drama. This doesn't suit the professional ethics of an advocate. Okay, I admit that. But I am not trying to kill someone, Sir. Just trying to save people from potholes on roads! A copy of the evidence shall be accepted by the court only after it is shared with the defence. Adv. Gangadharan... it will be good if you understand the basic functioning of the legal process. Adv. Shukoor, I said the court will accept the evidence. As if there are no courts above him! Pointless, since you'll be pleading the case there too! Get aside. Move! In a compelling David and Goliath story developing out of India in the state of Kerala, a man accused of robbery is taking on a far more powerful adversary, a minister of the state. In the last 10 months, the plaintiff Mr. Kozhummal Rajivan has been waging a battle in court to sue Mr. KP Preman. Kerala's public works minister. In a turn of events, that has caught the public imagination Mr. Rajivan who just has a primary school education is appearing himself as his attorney for the trial. The backstory of civic corruption in Kerala where 4000 people are killed and 40000 injured annually in road accidents, is a matter of grave concern. However, events unfolded in such a way that it was not Mr. Rajivan who bore the brunt of the dog's attack but the minister and the state administration. The 5 witnesses that appeared for the complainant are the following. Kozhummal Rajivan Sureshan Kaavunthazhe Johnny David Sumalatha PK Akash Kunjikann The statements of the above and the submitted evidence are attempting to prove that the pothole on the road led to Rajivan being bitten by the dogs. - Are you aware of this? - Yes. Do you agree? Why would I! You are the reason for the potholes accuses Engineer Samuel. How do you plead to that charge? Not guilty. Would you like to add anything Minister KP Preman? Yes, Sir. Go ahead. This began the day I became a minister. The entire opposition... is trying to remove me from my ministerial post. There are political conspiracies behind it. Rajivan is part of that conspiracy. On the day of our party meet he came to meet me. For this dog-case he wanted me to pay him a huge ransom. And he threatened to file a case and bring me a bad name. I have no prior enmity towards Rajivan or reason to harm him. As per the norms laid down by these engineers, not a single contractor will bid to build it. Just because a dog bit someone somewhere filing a case against me is definitely part of a larger conspiracy, Sir. Please don't cause me trouble for something that I don't even know of. A whole community is looking forward to my service. Don't disappoint them. That is all I have to say. Oh, you think you can get away with one dialogue of yours! Sit down, Rajivan. Go home if you want to speak while Section 313 is being answered. Rajivan, sit. Don't create a scene. The minister won't have the guts to answer me directly. Sir, you don't have to answer. - You sit down. - It's okay. Let him speak. Hey! I decide who speaks and when. Not you. Get it? Okay, you speak. On March 29th, there was a murder on a shuttle court. Prakashan... following a heated argument in the shuttle court, kicked Thampi. Thampi fell on Vipin. Vipin stumbled onto Gopi, who was just watching the game. The metal bar in Vipin's hands, struck Gopi in his chest killing him instantly. He didn't die! He was martyred! Even though Vipin was holding the bar that struck Gopi, the case was registered against the person who kicked him... Prakashan. Since the dead man and the man who stabbed him were both of his party, the person who kicked him became the accused. If the reason for Gopi's death... was the kick by Prakashan... then the reason the dog bit me was... your signature to alter the contract! Right? The minister's job is not to look for potholes on the road. Others have been appointed to do that. Government officers. They will do the needful. Then why don't you send them to beg for votes too?! Why do you roam around in khaadi clothes... Hey! Hey! Grab him. Make him sit. Sit down! What is this? How dare you do this in a court? I get a little lenient with you and you think you can chew my ear off! You think this is your house? Preman this is not the assembly! Good lord! What nuisances! Such hell! Are you done examining the witness? Yes, Sir. - Adv. Shukoor? - Yes, Sir. - Adv. Gangadharan? - Yes, done. Adv. Krishnan? Lord! What all must I see before I leave? [15 months later] CMP 1899/2018 CC No. 1926/2018 Complainant Rajivan Kozhummal. Accused No. 1 KP Preman. Accused No. 2 Samuel Puliyullaveettil. Accused No. 1 present, Your Honour. A 2 also present. Please get into the witness box. Your Honour, I am appearing for Accused No. 1. In this case, the prosecution examined 5 witnesses... including the complainant. These statements, on careful examination, can be found to be baseless and make no sense when read together. In the statement of Rajivan, the first witness, during the music program at the temple festival he mentions that the MLA was present at the venue. Right after the music program, the firecrackers go off. The right time for a thief to steal. When breaking a door open and entering no one will notice because of the sound of the firecrackers. - Sir, during the... - You! Sit down. It's difficult to believe that you were peeing at the wall, Rajivan! That street is very well lit. And Sir, the street that he walked through to get there is relatively dark! Witnesses 2 and 4 are exaggerating. That's the auto driver and his girlfriend. They use the auto as a place to romance. What else would the driver need to lose control? Sir, there is enough space to steer an auto if a truck hits it on that 18-feet-wide road. He hit the post, because of his own carelessness. The prosecution in their own submission uses the word 'scraped'. A wall 4.75 feet high... It's preposterous to say Rajivan jumped that for self-defence. It's not possible. Document No. 2 are CCTV visuals from two different places. Witness No. 3 Johnny... sells banned narcotic substances and his statement cannot be believed. Didn't the court ask you to keep quiet? I just got up to adjust my dhoti-- Don't adjust it until it's your turn to speak. Sir... above all... the so called cyclist from Mizoram hasn't made it to the court yet. Because there is no person like that. Akash Kunjikann, who is a habitual user of drugs, made up the rest in his hallucination. They have miserably failed to prove their case. Your Honour, my humble submission is that... Accused No. 1 Minister KP Preman may be acquitted of all charges. That's all, Your Honour. For complainant's hearing. 28/02/2020. I was 14 when I first stole something. Broke into a hotel. Nobody asked me why I was stealing. Instead of handing me over to the police, if they had asked me why I did it I would have probably never stolen again. But nobody asks that. Because... who wants to know the reason?! A few days back in Tamil Nadu a container lorry rammed into a bus and 19 people died. The son of an auto driver I know was among them. He was just 24. The RTO submitted a report within a week. The lorry driver was arrested and the case was closed. Everyone slept peacefully. Job done. The verdict... involuntary manslaughter. In an accident, those directly and indirectly responsible are both considered guilty. So says the law, right? That's what I've heard. In that case isn't everyone guilty... from the person who fitted the container bolt to the person who overloaded the container, and the owners of the trucking company who told the driver to continue driving at night? When the firecrackers go off, a thief will never break in. The owners could have just been jolted awake and may get up to pee. A train that passes by everyday at the same time may not wake them up. But firecrackers go off only once a year. That is sure to wake them. Not all thieves look for opportunity in calamity. May be KP Preman does. The cyclist who fell into the pothole was a daily wage worker employed in a hotel He was from Mizoram. At the same that the public and the police were thrashing me Witness No. 5 Akash Kunjikann and Raghu took him to the hospital. Brother... are you okay? Get up! Brother! What happened? - Hang on tight, Brother. - Get him onto the bike. The cyclist cannot come to give his statement. Because three days later... he died. When he fell, he hit his head. The road is not just for vehicles. It is also for walking, right? When poor people are harassed by powerful men and someone stands up to them, there is something they always say... sue me! The courage comes from thinking we won't file a case or... is it because they feel that we won't win even if we sued them? Both are bad, right? For judgement, August 11th. [11th August 2020] [Petrol Price Rs. 81.73] Ignorance is the root cause of all difficulties. Ignorance could be of a common man or that of those supposed to lead them. The root cause of problems make us emotionally disturbed. Finding solutions are difficult but never impossible. The denial of Kozhummal Rajivan's basic human right of walking on a public road safely, the constant threats to a government officer and not allowing him to discharge his duties, and the failure of the public servant to properly discharge his duties are the charges that this court finds KP Preman guilty of beyond doubt. Taking into account his age, a punishment of 6 months imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 1 Lakh are hence pronounced by this court. For the injuries the complainant had to endure because of the above offences and for his loss of reputation and dignity, Minister KP Preman must publicly apologize to Kozhummal Rajivan and his family. This court orders that the medical expenses incurred by Rajivan Rs. 3213 and the compensation for the loss of income due to the injuries caused, Rs. 72000, must be paid by KP Preman from his personal wealth to Rajivan immediately. Ministers like KP Preman must re-examine and understand the duties and responsibilities of their positions. For fighting this battle and keeping his faith in the judiciary, Rajivan deserves praise. Accused No. 2 Samuel Puliyullaveetil is found Not Guilty and is acquitted since his actions were coerced by the first accused in the case. The verdict shall be enacted with the permission of the Honourable High Court. Until such time, Minister KP Preman is granted bail in his own name. [A few months later] [Petrol Price Rs. 100.11] Have some more, please? Just this much more. It's only this much... come on, open your mouth. If you finish it, you can ride your cycle. - Devi, I am leaving. - Just a moment... coming. Daddy will be back soon, sweetheart! Okay? Say Bye to Daddy! - Bye bye! - Bye Bro! Start the truck! Let him walk a little. But a little ahead is the main road! Start the truck. Which moron made such a big pothole on the road?!
