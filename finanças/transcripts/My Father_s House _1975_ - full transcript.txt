[HORNS HONKING] [GROANING] -Are you feeling any pain? -Were you taking medication? -Can you hear us? -Ever had Demerol? We're going to help you. NURSE: Mr. Lindholm, you're going to be all right. [BREATHING HEAVILY] DOCTOR: Easy with him. [INDISTINCT TALKING] [COUGHS] Demerol, 25 milligrams. INTERN: I.V.? DOCTOR: Go ahead. Five percent solution. -May have to do a cut down. -INTERN: Are you sure? DOCTOR: No, we're okay. [MONITOR BEEPING] [MOANS] JUDITH: Tom? Tom? -NURSE: Mrs. Lindholm? -Yes. I'm sorry, but you'll have to go now. I know, but you're only allowed five minutes. I doubt if he knows you're here. He's heavily sedated. [GROANS] Is he in pain? Oh, no. He's on cloud nine. He's only 41 years old. Did you know that? He's only 41 years old. TOM JR.: In the end, there was a pain in his chest. And I knew, as my mother did, he would never see his house again. As she watched him descend, she wanted to cry out, "Look, look around you." But she just stayed silent, for she knew he'd see it all. He passed quietly, my father. As softly as he walked. And with him went a way of life I cherished. A world where death came only to pollywogs. Where old age was the number of rings on a tree. Where life was a great wood house, and beautiful green hills. [ALARM RINGING] [ALARM RINGING] Tom Junior? Brad? Susan? Time to get up. Children. Children. Wait your turn. Wait your turn. Why she always get it first? Because she's the fastest. Fire, fire, the house is on fire! Hey, look at this! A hole in the door. I can see everything. P-yew, I can too. -Boys. -BOTH: Morning, Dad. Boys, a little respect, please. Let's be gentlemen. She's always the first. -She's entitled to be. -But why can't we ever? Young ladies have certain prerogatives in this world. Among them is ready access to the powder room. [DOOR OPENING] BOTH: ♪ Here comes the bride -Uh, uh, that'll be enough, Brad. Tom. -Thank you, Daddy. -You're welcome, Peaches. -Goodbye, toads. TOM JR.: Of the children, Susan was the oldest. Then came me, and then Brad. The baby of the household was Jane. Famous for once having fallen from the second story window and landing unharmed in the Bay berry bushes. She's cute. It's a shame she can't stay that way. We could try shellacking her. We could try shellacking you. Our nurse was Anna. Not really, a nurse at all, but a poor widow woman who father felt sorry for and brought home over my mother's objections. Honestly, Thomas, I sent you out for a strong young girl. A good strong Swedish girl, and you come back with... Well, I looked. I looked at all the big and strong young ones, -and I didn't like any of them. -Thomas. None of them would fit this family. And I was about to leave when I spied Anna way, way down at the end of the bench. And there was something about her face made me know she'd like to work here. So here she is. Isn't she wonderful? [BARKS] Our dog was named "Hundy." It stood for a hundred. Which Father claimed was the exact number of spots on him. The fact that he really only had 86 spots didn't matter, because 86 wasn't nearly as good a name. Eat up, boy. You got the best garbage in the neighborhood. And our cook was named Noble. Our partner in trying to get Father's goat on every possible occasion. ♪ Don't know why there's no sun up in the skies ♪ Stormy weather... Between Father and Noble there was always a kind of running battle. Waged mostly out of habit and for the amusement of us children. ♪ Keeps rainin' all the time [ALL CLAMORING] What the... [ALL LAUGHING] Well, if I had have done a thing like that I'd expect to be fired, wouldn't I? -Yes. I expect you would. -Well, then? Well, I did fire her once, but she wouldn't go. Well, just stop paying her. She'll leave soon enough. Yes. That's a fine idea, Anna. Yes, by God, that's just what I will do. Well, for the Lord's sake, you can't do a thing like that. What kind of a man are you, anyway? How would we get along here without Noble? Well, if you insist, Anna. I guess we'll just have to let her stay. -Thank you. -Thank you. Thank you, Anna. -Best April Fool ever. Thank you, Anna. -Okay. ♪ There's a hole in the bottom of the sea ♪ There's a hole in the bottom of die sea ♪ There's a hole, there's a hole ♪ There's a hole in the bottom of die sea ♪ TOM JR.: Father always said that he and the Lord had something in common. They both worked six days and on the seventh day, they both rested. Sunday was a day for what he called, "big ideas." Events as monumental and secret as he could possibly make them. Faster. Our means of transportation was a wonderful old touring car named "Celeste." She had a gas tank that always registered zero. Making it impossible to know when she was going to run out. -Daddy? -Huh? Daddy if gold is where you find this, where do you find silver? Why, I don't know, Son. Where do you find silver?

Just what is die "Big Idea" today? Well, I told you I wanted it to be a secret. Well, we've been driving for an hour and a half. YOUNG TOM JR.: Come on, Daddy. -Can anyone guess? -We're going to climb a mountain! No, we did that last week. We're going to walk across country to the ocean. -No, we've done that, too. -Give up? Yes, Daddy, tell what is it? We're... going on vacation. -Vacation? -Vacation? What do you mean, we're going on vacation? Just that. We've begun it. We're on our way to Maine. -Maine! Vacation! -My friends? I wanted to bring my bike. But we've packed nothing, we have no clothes. Isn't it nice this way? No fuss, no bother. Look at all the trouble we saved. Look at all the room we have in the car. Thomas, this is outrageous. Wait a minute, I have a baseball game tonight. Hey, I was gonna play, too. Katherine Roberts is coming over for tea. Thomas, turn this car around. Now, you turn it around right now. Look, maybe it'll be good, really. When one of Father's "Big Ideas" took hold, it could not be shaken loose. And what came to be known as the "Big Idea" vacation, was the best we ever had. All right. TOM SR.: Tom! Tom! -[GUNSHOT] -I hate you! Jenny, seems to be some acceleration on three. Mr. Lindholm? Mr. Lindholm? Tom? Tom? -Darling? Are you all right? -Yeah? Yeah. Oh. My arm. -Probably slept on it. -Oh, oh, gosh. Numb. -Oh. -How about some aspirin? Okay. -Time is it, anyway? -5:30. 5:30, time for the big splash. JUDITH: Hmm? Big splash. Father taking a dive into the pond. Every summer. 5:30 sharp there was this tremendous, cannonball splash. Claimed a belly flop was good for the circulation. -Are you sure you're all right? -Yeah, thanks, dear. Oh, boy. I keep thinking so much about him lately. Keeps popping into my head. Maybe he's trying to tell you something. Like, slow down. Take a few days off. God, if I only could. Why don't you, Tom? Sleep late tomorrow. Steven's been home for three days, and he's hardly seen you. No, I got a press day tomorrow. -Maybe he can come down there. -No. He's been wanting to talk to you. Yeah, what about? It'll wait another day. [RADIO PLAYING] -Seems dishonest. -Another day or two won't matter. -I'm not going to change my mind. -I know that. Well, then, why not just tell it? -He's got a lot on his mind. -He's always got a lot on his mind. Drink your milk, Zozo. Ellen, you're gonna be late. -So am I. Good morning, Steve. -Morning. Take it easy, the trains run every 20 minutes. Just coffee, dear, thanks. Good morning, Zozo. That nose is too small, I can't breathe. Take it back. No. He didn't sleep well last night, and the magazine goes to press today. And I want him to leave this house with a clear head. Oh, gosh, what time is it? Slow down. -Morning, Peaches. -Morning. I'm late. Eat. Sorry, I haven't seen much of you, Steve. What've you been doing? -Nothing much. -How long are you going to be home? Forever. -What's going on? -Nothing. What is it? What's going on? -Nothing. -What, something's going on. Now what is it? I goofed, didn't I? Somebody please tell me what the hell is going on. I'm not going back to school. What are you talking about? I don't know what I'm doing there. I didn't want to go there in the first place. I told you that. And I told you, and you agreed we'd talk about it after the first term. Could we continue this later? What are you gonna do? Nothing special. I'd just like to take one day at a time. Just drop out and turn off, huh? Sort of. [HORN HONKING] I gotta go. -Why don't we table this... -What's wrong, Steve? What the hell's wrong with you? It's not what's wrong with me, it's what's right with me. You've had everything on a silver spoon. -What? What have I had? -Please. Well, what do you want? Your trip is what I've got here. It sounds so awful right now. Why don't we just sleep on it. No, I don't want to sleep on it I have to sleep on it. I can't talk about it today. -All right, what day? -I don't know what day. -Just tell me what day. -I don't what day, but I can't do it today. I'm sorry, Steve. TOM JR.: I remember in summer one year it was pepper dry. He'd come home exhausted. Molten gravel crunching like soft crackers beneath the tires of his car. So greatly had he sweated that his good suit would have to be hung out to dry while we begged him to take us swimming in the pond atop our hill. Can't we go, please? -Oh, come on. -Come on. There was never any consideration of what his day had been like. We all just assumed he'd come home for our pleasure. SUSAN: Are there really black snakes there? -BRAD: Big as pie thumbs. -As big as knitting needles. SUSAN: Stop it. BRAD: Big enough to eat a whole people. And spit out the eyes like seeds. Daddy. [SCREAMS] -It got him! -It got him! It got him! All right, that's better, isn't it? We'd stay in the water till our bodies ached with cold, then crawl up the bank and sit there talking. Speaking in whispers in deference to the night. -That's pretty, Daddy. -Mmm.

Do you suppose we go up there when we die? I really don't know. -Dad? -Yes, Tom? Do you think you'll mind being dead? I don't know. I will. Can you tell me why? I don't know. It just seems it won't be nearly as nice being up there looking down as it will be, being down here looking up. It's not funny, Daddy. Dying isn't funny at all. I'm afraid of it. I dream of it. It scares me awful. What scares you about it, Peaches? Just being gone. Well, think about it this way, Peaches. If you think about being gone, well, suddenly, it makes being here just so very much more important. Well, maybe that's what dying is for. To make sure that we treasure every moment of life. Look at that moth. He's flying straight to the moon. The times I remember best, were the times we were alone. Those moments when he made me feel I was the most important person in the world.

[GUNSHOT] -Go get my gun. -What is it? Go get my gun. Tom, Davis is waiting. He's called twice. -Tom. -Morning, Paula. I'm supposed to tell you as soon as you get off the elevator to get down to fourteen. There's a problem with the... Tom, I got NASA on the phone, and it's just like I warned you. Now they're having second thoughts about releasing those photographs. -It's in your ball park. -You're at bat, baby. Transfer my calls to fourteen, Paula. -I want Bob Senders down there with me. -Got it. Meanwhile, Davis not to panic. Have him go over those cost sheets, and I want coffee and cigarettes in fourteen, please. -How's that grab you? -No. Yeah. George, do you know what day this is? That's right. Now, if we don't get those photos you might be back doing passport pictures with me. I don't care what you do, George. You got carte blanche, you charter a plane, anything. Just get the photos, will ya? Now, Jimmy, look. Two hundred thousand people died in the cyclone. Now what have we got to make us believe that? I say something here. What was it? Pakistani woman or something. Where is that? Yeah, that's it. Yeah, yeah. What do you think? Huh? Okay, where were we? Uh, what's the picture about? Khrushchev loses power. Commissar broods in the sun, right? Relegated to children, grandchildren, park... Hello. Simple, direct. "Ly Tran, aged twelve, caught in the war. "Watches while her wooden leg is being made." Right now. You know what time it is? For God's sake. Well, you're late already. Yeah. Tom wants this right now. I don't care how you get here, anyway you want to get here, but get here. Hype the horses, Bob, keep it as... -All right, I'll wait. -Make it a little more subtle. Yeah. All right. Great, great. Throw up the schedule. Get a rewrite on that right away. Where's Paula? Will you get Paula in here please. What about the Khrushchev family pictures, that Fidel Castro? I want it, I want it. Where's that picture? Where's that supposed to be? Just hold on for a minute. Yeah. Is that NASA on the phone? Nothing yet. Zero. Hold it! That's it? Tom, I knew it! We hit the fan. No NASA photos. Oh, come on. Well, listen, I did everything I could. You said we had clearance, right? Didn't you say we had clearance? Well, I assumed that... This is press day, do you know that? This is press day! -Tom? -What? Your son is here. I know I'm interrupting you. I'm sorry. Steve, this is the wrong time. -Well, what are we gonna use? -Always the wrong time. I know it. Now is the wrong time, okay? What's the right time for me, okay? Have we got anything in the file? All right, leave... Okay. What do you want to say? I don't want to say anything. I wanted to talk. Steve, I'm in big trouble. This is press day and I'm in big trouble. So am I. Well, let's help each other and wait, all right? No. [SIGHS] I can't wait any more. It's got to be done now. What has to be done now? You've got to see who I am. You've got to see that I am not you. I know that. And that's my falling, right? No. Come on, admit it, that's what you expect me to be. It's true. No! Now, I won't stand on trial, Steve. If I've interrupted some speech that you've rehearsed, don't tell me you, you want me to talk. You just say what you've come to say and leave, all right? Okay. I... I don't want to wake up someday and find myself like you. Why? Because you've become obsessed with all this. I see. And you've forgotten about love. Is that it? Yeah. Okay. I'm going to tell you something from my loveless heart, okay? I love you, Steven Lindholm. Even if you make me damn mad. And maybe I don't want to wake up and see me like me either, but I can't afford that luxury. That's the kind of views you get from lounging around in bed, and I can't do it, and I never have been able. But you have done it for yourself. No. For you. No, don't lay that on me. I will lay it on you. No, you won't. Not anymore. WOMAN: What about the Paris fashion spread? What the hell's a fashion layout anyway? These are troubled times. We could use that space to launch a whole series on Black history. I say a cooking layout how people always are talking and thinking about food. Food, food, that's all you think about. -Well, that's all they're talking about... -No social conscience. MAN: What do you say, Tom? You okay? Yeah. What, uh... What's in the food layout? Only vegetables. Very colorful. Uh, zucchini, Jerusalem artichokes, Lebanese leeks, crookneck squash, and just a smidgen of Bulgarian Beluga. It will make a beautiful two page spread. Tom, I call it "A Balkan blend of vegetables". And then you can put a little sprinkling of dill right on top. Marvelous! And then, on top of that, if you... [LAUGHING] Tom? [LAUGHING] And on special occasions like Mother's Day, we'd go out to a restaurant, and he'd order corn. Take out his little gold knife and cut each kernel. Explain to the waiter he didn't want the skins sticking on his teeth -in a fancy restaurant. -[LAUGHS] He sound like quite a character. Yeah. How's the arm? It's okay. Well, I guess I better get back to work. Why don't you let them do something by themselves for a change? God knows, they get paid enough. Tell them I'll be back in about five minutes. Take ten. I'll let you know when the dummy's ready. TOM JUNIOR: You can't do that. It's Daddy's favorite brandy. SUSAN: I've got to. It's the only bottle worthy of it. He'll whip us for this. He'll thrash us. Don't be ridiculous, he's never hit us in his life. BRAD: He's going to, this time. You get the paste. You bring Anna. Try to understand, Anna. It's beyond our help. Then who, whose fault is it? I want to know. These are hard times, Anna. We simply can't afford you any longer. Oh, listen, put me out in the cold, but don't ask me to feel sorry for you. Well, I don't know what more I can do. -[SOBS] -I've arranged for a new job with a nice family. No, but this is the family I like. You, you can come and visit us, Anna. You, you can come and see Jane every Sunday. C'mon, now. Come on. Dry your eyes, and you put on a happy face for the children. [SOB] Yes, Tom, did you want something? Oh, uh, we'd like to see Anna, please. Alone. If it would be all right, sir. I don't see why not. Yes, I think that would be fine. I wish there was a way. I know. But you tried. She'll be all right I thought that when we made it through the Depression, we'd be safe. Now... TOM: Near the end of the Depression, father's company began to flounder, and during those days, there was tension in our house. Worst of all, was the departure of people we'd come to know and love as part of our own family. What's going on? Dearest Anna... We've loved you so very much, we wish to keep you with us always. Oh my darlings. Oh, my, my darlings. [WEEPING] I want you to breathe deeply, Anna, and hold a huge breath in your lungs. What? Glue, please. What's going on here? You can't do that! That's your father's good bottle. We want a keepsake of you, Anna, to treasure always. We didn't want to ask for. Better start breathing deep, Anna, it dries pretty fast. -What in the name of God? -We're going to keep your breath, Anna. We want you to breathe in this bottle. We'd cap it right away, keep it with us forever. My breath? [SOBBING] Thank you, My darlings. [SOBBING] WOMAN: You horrible boy! You dreadful thing! How big should we make it? I don't know. We'll have to get her measurements. -Did you get Mom's tape measure? -Mmm-hmm. And remember, don't giggle or anything. I won't. You got something to write on? Hi, Susan, could you do us a favor? What? -Could we get your measurements? -My what? Your measurement. You know, how tall you are and stuff. I know what measurements are, dummy. What do you want them for? -'Cause we're... -We're making a surprise for you. That's it. A surprise. What kind of surprise? If we told you, it wouldn't be a surprise any longer. Hold this, please. Five feet, one inch tall. Seven inches thick. Thank you, Susan. Won't you please tell me what if s for? -It's a surprise. -A surprise? A surprise. It's for your grave. We're digging your grave. [BOYS LAUGH] Stop it this Instant! I hate you! I hate you! [BOYS LAUGH] Hey, you boys, what are you doing? Noble, they're digging a grave for me. Make them stop. We're gonna put her in it and bury her. Make them stop, Noble. Make them stop. We'll just tie her up, not knock her out or anything. So she can feel the dirt falling on her eyes and nose, and face and all over. You horrible, vile boys! Really, Thomas, this has been going on long enough. Now they terrorized their poor sister, and something has got to be done. -Now look, all they did... -They dug her grave. They dug that poor child's grave. Please, now listen, just once, for me, you spank them. Lay down the law. All right, all right [HEAVES] I suppose I must. Boys, are you in there? Bradford? Thomas Junior? I know you're awake. I'm sure you know why I'm here. So let's just get out of bed and face it. You've been frightening your sister, and that cannot be allowed. Brad? Tom? Okay. If that's the way you want it... Aw! Well, that does it! BRAD: Chicky, the cops! -[TOM EXCLAIMS] -Tom, Tom come on out of there. -Let go of my leg! -I will not! I'm innocent! -Brad. -Someone framed me. -Oh! -I'm telling you, you're making me mad. Come back here, you little devil. Call in the marines! Oh, you're gonna need more help than the marines, young man. -Come here! -No, no, you don' t believe in that! -No! -You'll kill him! You'll kill him! Ow! Ow! That's enough, you got him. If I don't have you... TOM JUNIOR: Come on, Brad, get out! Wait... Look, I'm telling you. Your mother's gonna spank us all, if... No, no. -How many pages? -A hundred and ten. All right, we'll proof it a page at a time. Paula, cigarettes and coffee, please. Hi, what you doing? JUDITH: Steven, is that you? No, it's me. JUDITH: Hi, I thought it was Steven. -Isn't he home yet? -No. -He usually calls. -Oh, he'll be alright. He's a big boy. How about an omelet? He came into the office today. And? We talked. Well, what did he say? He said he didn't want to wake up someday and find himself like me. He's hurt, Tom. -The boy's hurt. -He's hurt! I'm hurt! -Don't shout. -Damn it all, I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't. I make a living the only way I know. And if anybody else knows any other way to do it, I wish the hell they'd tell me. -Why don't you go to bed? -Oh, no. You go ahead, babe. -Do you want me to wait up with you? -No. Go ahead. Can you sleep late tomorrow? I got to get up early for that Kennedy article. Tom? Do we need it? All this? I don't know. I thought we did. TOM JR.: In the late 1930s, father's company failed, and life on our hill changed in the extreme. Noble had to leave because we could no longer afford her. Even our car sat idle for want of gas. With the servants gone, mother worked from dawn till dusk, and the sound of laughter was absent from our house. Tom? I'll be there in moment, Mary. Upstairs in a moment. In a moment? You mean after you've had another drink. Yes, I've just had a drink. Out of a bottle? Oh, out of anything I want. Every night lately, Tom. Now you stop it Mary, will you? Just just stop it! -Don't think I haven't noticed. -Now, stop it I said. -That's enough! -Don't raise your voice to me. I win raise my voice any time I feel like raising my voice. This my house. -It's my house. -Your house? Your house? No part mine or the children's. Oh, can't I just have some peace for God's sake. Just some peace. From what? From what, Tom? From myself. From the bills. From failure. -You are no failure, Tom. -Oh, God. You have achieved so much, if you'd only stop and realize it. You have given us a wonderful life, filled with love and courage. You're passing on everything that really counts to your children. Come on. Come on to bed. I think I'll just stay downstairs for a little while. Please, please come to bed with me. I don't want to go to bed alone. I love you. More if it's possible than the day I married you. TOM JR.: While we children took odd jobs and father continued to look for work in the city, mother took it into her head that she would write children's books. And to research her stories, had to experience them first hand. The baby's garbage. Ah, let'see. What do you think of this, children? It's called The Little Garbage That Nobody Wanted. Huh? Does anyone like that title? Sure, Mom. It's keen. I think it's yucky. I do, too. How about Having Fun In The Garbage Truck? -That's good. -Yeah, I like it better, too. Good. Now then, all I have left is to write the story. TOM JR.: Fun In The Garbage Truck was actually sold. Followed byFun In The Barber Shop, formerly titled How Many Hairs On The Barbershop Floor. But it did little to cheer father. Who spent most of his time just wanting to be alone. All right, now, we're in trouble. We're still a family. Like Mom says, "A family can always survive." Do we have enough food to eat? -Okay, we could plant a garden. -Okay -but no turnips, I hate turnips. -Brad, our first job's to cheer up father. I say we go to him and propose a big idea. It might remind him of how happy you can be. That's a good idea. -C'mon let's go tell him. -All right, c'mon. TOM JR.: Before that time, I'd never seen a grown man cry. I was old enough then so that father and I no longer kissed, but how I longed to hug him, to help him, to let him know I cared. [GUNSHOT] -I hate you! -TOM SR.: Tom! Please! -[GUNSHOT] -I hate you! No, I hate you! Go away! I hate you! [GUNSHOT] [BLOWING WHISTLE] -Sir, what's wrong? What happened? -You live around here? -This is my property. -Did you hear anything during the night? An explosion, anything? No, it's been thundering. My power's out. We can't raise them on a short wave, Captain. -TOM SR.: What's happened? -A light plane went down. Is there a freakin' figure right in around here. -OFFICER: What's on that ridge? -Just woods. Two small pines and a stony brook. -Up there? -Heavy growth. What kind? Maple and Ash. -You seem to know this place pretty good. -Yes, sir. Maybe you could be some help to us. Captain, we're ready. We're gonna fan out as far as we can. -Can I Dad? -Okay. Move out! Please, Dad, I know I can help. Please, Dad, I know every single inch of this hill. You stay right with them. I'll go get our power on. I'll be right back. [WHISTLE BLOWING] All right let's move on! C'mon, move on! -My Dad says I... -Fan out! Fan out! Okay son, c'mon. Fan out! Two men together is one man wasted. Now the last radio contact we had from the plane said they were going down into high trees. I don't think they had time to pinpoint their location exactly. High trees? High trees? High trees! High trees! Help! All right, that's it. Move! Take it easy. Give me a hand. We found them. Yeah, the boy found them. They found the plane. They said a boy found it. ZOZO: Daddy. Daddy! Morning time. Zozo, go get Mommy. Tefl Mommy, Daddy needs her, Zozo. Zozo. Oh, you're heavy. -I want to sit in Daddy's lap. -No, Zozo. TOM JR.: That's all right, love. It's okay,babe, I feel better now. [TOM JR. COUGHING] Zozo, get in the back seat. Will you, Please? Okay. I'm all right, babe, just Zozo. -I want to sit with you. -Well, all right, well, just sit along side. Okay? You're not all right, are you? I'm all right. Just need some air, that's all. Oh, my God. Move! Oh, no. Oh. Hey! MAN: Hey, where're you going? Hey, come back here! No, no, Zozo, come on darling, no. -No! -I want to see the window. No, Zozo. -Get in the back! -No! It's all right babe. All right come on, Zozo, honey, that's it sweetheart, get in the back. It's all right, babe, just make it as fast as you can, will you please? All right. [HORN BLOWING] -[GUNSHOT] -No! I hate you! -[GUNSHOT] -No! I hate you! Go away! I hate you! YOUNG TOM JR.: No, no! Tom, get away. Help it, we have to help it! This is the only way we can help him. He's in too much pain. Tom, don't you understand, they just shot him and left him here to die. -You're no better than they are! -Tom. Tom, let him die fast for God's sake! Don't make him suffer. -Don't kill it! Let it live! -Nothing can live in that much pain. -I hate you! -Tom. I hate you! You are fake! I hate you! I hate you! Tom, Tom, try to understand. -[GUNSHOT] -Oh, I hate you! No, I hate you! Go away, I hate you! [HORN BLOWING] All right. Okay. Oh, shit! Are you feeling any pain? Were you taking medication? Can you hear us? Ever had Demerol? DOCTOR: We're going to help you. DOCTOR: Easy with him. NURSE: Demerol, 25 milligrams. DOCTOR: I.V.? DOCTOR: Go ahead. Five percent solution. DOCTOR: I may have to do a cut down. Are you sure? DOCTOR: No, we're okay. NURSE: Mr. Lindholm. DOCTOR: Now that's better. Hi. Hi. How are you? Okay. Children? There for a while, eh? I wasn't going to see you again. NURSE ON LOUDSPEAKER: Doctor Hill. Hey, you taking company? Dr. McDonald. Come in here. You rascal, how did you get in here? I snuck up the back stairs. -You did? -Why don't you look out the window? What's out the window? Just look and you'll see. Oh, I'm not supposed to, besides... Daddy, Zozo's down there, she wants to wave. Zozo. House staff Blue. House staff Blue. -Where is she? Where is she? -There. This way. Cardiac arrest. -What happened? -I don't know. He was sleeping. -Sodium bicarbonate, 50 ccs. -Sodium bicarbonate. -I'm sorry, but you have to leave. -Who is his doctor? Redfern. No reaction, nothing. Charge the defibrillator. I don't understand it. He'd been getting better right along. Stand back. Charge it again. Stand back. Nothing. Cardiac massage. Stat. Never mind. He's dead. -Morning. -Morning, Doc. -How are you? -All right. What you doing in here still? You're supposed to be out exercising. Oh, I didn't want to do it by myself. Oh, come on, you can do that alone. Well, you know, I wouldn't want something to happen. Well, better today than tomorrow. Why? Because today you're in the hospital, and tomorrow, you'll be home. -Home? Tomorrow? -Yeah. I promised Judith, you be back for Christmas. That's great Doc. Am I ready? Well, I don't see why not, if you take it easy. Your scan is good, it's back to normal. Good. Uh, can I go to work? Oh, I didn't say that. I said, uh, that you could go home. And do what? Sit around for awhile and watchyour diet. Take your medicine. Watch T. V. and wait for another heart attack, right? Not necessarily. I don't know, Doc. I could never live the life of an invalid. Well, then, stop thinking like one. Now, you watch that blood pressure. Don't stay in there too long. Tomorrow morning. Here he is. -Hi, Daddy. -Hi. -Oh, I can walk all right, son. -We can get that suitcase. I can carry my own suitcase. -Then take my arm. -Wait a minute. Miraculous as it may seem, I'm about to walk into my own house, carrying my own suitcase. Put some on the bottom, Zozo. That's good, Zozo. Good girl. Put some more up in the top. That a girl. SUSAN: Steve, your side needs some more. -This'll make you feel better. -Oh, my, my, my. Oh, thank you. Oh, you, too? Oh, thank you, baby. Thank you. I wanna put up the star! It's too high for you, Zozo. Pick me up! Pick me up! It's very delicate and you might break it. I want to put the gold star! Okay. Be very careful. [GRUNTING] Up we go. [SHATTERING] I broke it! -Aw, that's all right. That's all right, baby. -[WHIMPERING] That's all right. That's all right, Zozo. Yes. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey. Let me tell you something. If gold is where you find it, where do you find silver? Where? Under the Lone Ranger. [ALL LAUGHING] -Ha ha ha ha. -Oh, ha ha ha ha. My brother thought it was funny. I don't. [ALL LAUGHING] [CHILDREN CHATTERING] TOM JR.: It's gotta be. For the star. BRAD: I'll find it before anyone. TOM JR.: No, you won't. BRAD: I know exactly where it is. FATHER: Don't forget now, majority rules. TOM: I remember him at Christmas. A giant made of leather and canvas and lace boots, with bare hands that could roll snowballs and never get cold. I found it! This is it, the perfect one. No, it's over here. Yours is too little. This is the one. I think I got a perfect point for a star. It was his favorite season, Christmas. I think because it allowed him to be a child. SUSAN: Mine's best, Daddy. BRAD: No, mine. How about this one? I mean, what's wrong with this one? Well, looks like we have a dilemma here, doesn't it? Jane, what do you think? [INDISTINCT] That one? [CHILDREN PROTESTING] -It's awful, Daddy! -It's horrible. If Santa Claus sees that thing in our house, he'll die laughing. I won't vote for it. It looks sick. -No, me neither. -I won't vote for it either, Daddy. And you said it yourself, the majority rules. Children, which of all the trees on this hill do you suppose never, ever thought it would be lucky enough to be chosen as a Christmas tree? What are you thinking? I was just thinking about what it's going to be like, from now on. Go to bed at 7:00, waking up at 2:00 in the morning. Everybody hovering over me. It'll pass. We'll all get used to you. Just so happy you're home. -How about Steve? -Hmm? Is he happy? Of course. Did he say anything? About what? Oh, about him and me and what he's gonna do. He wants to leave. He and another boy are talking about hitchhiking. Maybe even India. I didn't want to talk about it tonight. Soon? How soon? He wanted to wait until you came home. Hey. Hey. Did the doctor say anything about, uh... About what? -Oh, you know, about... -Hmm? Oh, yeah, he said it's okay. He said that as long as I don't make love with anyone but my wife. Doesn't want me to get too excited. It's a doctor's joke. -He doesn't know my wife. -He certainly doesn't. TOM: It was Christmas Eve, and my last visit at my father's house. I was taking a present to put under his tree. [FATHER COUGHING] Don't give up. You mustn't. [BREATHING DEEPLY] Now, get on with you. Come on, you can do it. [COUGHING] MOTHER: Thomas? I... I thought I could do it. It's all right, dearest. I want to help. TOM: It occurred to me then that he was actually going to die. I lay there the remainder of the night, listening to him moan, wondering if he was really as powerful as my memories had made him. Was he really the giant I remembered, or was his love affair with life too simple? Oh, my sweet husband. My love. MOTHER: To my love. My grower of roses. BRAD: "Better start breathing deep, Anna. It dries pretty fast" STEVEN: Somebody up here? -Oh, Steve? -Dad? -I thought I heard a noise. -Oh, I'm sorry, I, uh... That's okay. What time is it? It's about 3:00. Oh. Oh, yeah. Well, I was just, uh, poking around here, looking around at some old things. I couldn't sleep. I, uh... -Could I say for a minute? -Sure, come on in. I was gonna look at the pictures of Grandpa. Could I see some? Sure, I've got some slides here. Now that is your Aunt Jane. -You're kidding. -No. -That's unbelievable. -Yeah. Grandpa always said that his day would be a lot better if it started out with Jane holding his socks. So that's a picture of Jane holding Grandpa's socks. FATHER: We're gonna run Ring Road. We're gonna run it without stopping. We're gonna ran it without talking. [PROJECTOR CLICKS] STEVEN: Grandpa looks like one of the Keystone Cops or something. Yeah. That's his famous dive. The turtle flop. [LAUGHING] -STEVEN: God, that's you and Uncle Brad. -Mmm-hmm. Getting ready to imitate the turtle flop. Do you know who that is? Noble and Anna, right? Right. They always pretended they were jealous of each other. You know, I think they may have been, a little bit. -STEVEN: Grandpa? -Yeah. Doesn't look like the same man. Well, it was taken not too long before he died. His heart just gave up. I was there. Mom was there. I was talking to him very quietly and he just looked over at me as if he wanted something right away. That was it. I always felt that the last time I gazed at his face, it looked too stern, and it should have been wreathed in smiles, you know. You know, crinkles coming out of his eyes and laughter out of his mouth. Smoke rings kids used to put their lingers through. Getting that little-boy look whenever he got that big idea. I tried to give him a rose from his own garden. Straighten his tie for Mom, but I just couldn't. So, I said goodbye and left our empty hill. I once asked him... I think it was me. What was the meaning of death? And you know what he said? He said that death was to remind you how wonderful living is. Steve, I... I want to get to know you. And I hope you'll let me. I knew what it was like to have a father. And I want you to know, too. Well, shall we go now? Yeah. Could I help you? Yeah. I wish you would.
