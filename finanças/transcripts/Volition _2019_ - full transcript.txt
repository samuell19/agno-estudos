They say when you die, your whole life flashes before your eyes. I wish it were that simple. James. You have till the end of the day or your ass is out of here. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Coming. James! Okay! Okay, uh... You're four fuckin' days late. Where is my rent? I know and... - 500 bucks and now. - Okay. Good talk. You have till the end of the day or your ass is out of here. Okay, okay, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. Keep the change, Ben. Are you listening to me, James? Hey! Are you listenin' to me? I'll get it to you today. 5:00. No fucking later. Like I said, if this were simple to explain, I'd do it. Let me start here. 7th round. Everything you see has played out before. You just don't know it. See most people live their lives only experiencing the present moment, that fleeting snapshot that's here one second, gone the next. Man, I just need like a dollar for lunch. People call it "clairvoyance" or "presentiment". Man, I just need like a dollar for lunch. Elliot called it "entanglement", some quantum string theory bullshit about different events ringing out across space and time. Oh! Watch yourself, cowboy. Like signals from a satellite crossing over into different frequencies. I guess you could say I got a strong antenna. Oh, okay. Dude, you're killin' me here. Well, let's double down. Red shorts, goes down at 7:00. Hey, I've got a good feeling about this one. You wanna get in on this. You wanna scam the system, go ahead, but don't drag my ass down with you. Alright, well, can you give me a bottle whiskey at least. Can you do that much? Gonna pay me with my own money, huh? That's right. I'm sick of this shit. Either way, doesn't mean I'm special or anything. Just means this lousy life has played out before and somehow I'm stuck watching the rerun. You fuckin' bitch. Payday. Here we go. You fuckin' bitch! Hey, asshole! Get the fuck out of here, - fuckhead. - Stop! Look, I don't wanna go through the motions here, but let's get this over with, huh? You hit me, I hit you. Mind your own fuckin' business. Believe me, man, I would if I could. - Come on. - Are you fuckin' kidding me? This is kind of where you're supposed to hit me. Get off me! Double-teaming me, huh? Oh. Get the fuck off me. There. How you like that? - Oh! - Cocksucker. You okay? Fine. Assholes ran off together. Hey. Oh, hey, looks like our friend left us a little somethin'. Mmhmm. Payday. Who could have guessed? Here, your nose, it's bleeding. Oh, nice of you. Hey, uh, sorry about those guys. Why'd you do that? What, get my ass kicked? He was twice your size. Well, the bigger they are, the harder they fall. Uh... use your shower? You just zoned out. Sorry, I just... You look kind of familiar. You were so original for like 15 seconds. I was actually being kinda serious. I'm James. Angela. Angela. Listen, I should probably get going. Where are you headed? Just passing through, looking for work so... Well, I don't wanna stop you from doin' what you're doin', but if you ever wanna take a break from drivin', I'm just around the corner. Above Blue Chip Auto, it's a repair shop. Hangin' out in the alleyways now, Jimmy? Sal? Been a long time, kid. When did you get out? A couple of months ago. You are a mess. What happened to you? Playground scuffle. Ah! Yeah. You look good. Oh, kept me lean and clean in there. Is he a chaperone or what? Terry, meet James. Met him inside. Who's this? This is uh, Angela. - Hi. - Hey. Pleasure, sweetheart. You don't mind if I borrow your man for a second? - Oh, he's not my... - Hey... hey, we just met. Yeah. We won't be too long. Ray wants to talk. About what? You mean to say you don't know? Not yet. You're gonna wanna hear from him. So let's go talk some business. One sec. Okay, you earned at least half of this. Okay. I'll see you around, okay? Yeah. Get to a gas station. Get this guy cleaned up. Okay. Time to see Ray. Hey, Jeff. How's it going, kid? Hey, Sal. Right. Now, if you want cotton, as opposed to satin, that's a whole different thing. But it has to be doubled. That's what I said. Right. Okay, good. Done. Jesus fucking Christ. Drapes weighin' you down? Jimmy, in the flesh. Where you been hiding? Haven't been hiding, Ray, just doin' my thing. Thought maybe you were hangin' out with Professor Fruit Loop. I haven't seen him in a while. That's good. Walk with me. So how's life? It's day-to-day, you know? All that skill and no will. Here I am bustin' my schmeckle nickel-and-diming dudes over the square inch of a fucking curtain and you... You know, what I would do if I had your brain? Try to take over the world? Exactly. You want a drink? Sir. I thought you don't drink. I don't. Four years and not a fuckin' meeting. How do you like them apples? Sit. You meet Sal's buddy Terry from the joint? What'd you get in there for, Terry? Second-degree. What, you couldn't get first? You see that? All will, no skill. Drink up. So Sal says you wanna talk to me about somethin'. Yes, I got a proposition for you. One that might get you out of your day-to-day ways and me out of this fabric fuckin' purgatory. Okay, I'm listenin'. What are you finally proposing to me? You're lookin' at over 10 million VVS1 diamond. You don't even need to know what that means, just that they're flawless, rare, and worth a fuckin' fortune. So since when are you moving diamonds? I became acquainted with these guys from Zimbabwe. I heard they stole 'em from some dudes in Angola. What happens in Africa stays in Africa. I told him that I could move them for the right price. The only problem is the FBI is so far up my fuckin' ass they're comin' out of my mouth. I thought you were done with this kind of stuff. I mean, you know, after what happened. We're adjusting. No more showing coke or whatever the fuck else was in the linin' of those curtains. So what do you want from me? I need you to do that thing you do in that head of yours. I need you to find safe passage for these and then you can find yourself 100 grand freer. 100 grand? Yeah, it's a lot of fucking coin, right? And I would imagine it would go a long way toward keeping that low profile of yours. Mmm, halle-fuckin'-lujah. Hey, I know that look. You saw something, didn't you? What? What is it? I saw the handoff. Mmm, halle-fuckin'-lujah! - And I want 2 grand upfront. - Oh. Hey, I got shit to pay off, you want me, I want 2 grand. Alright. Look at you makin' easy money. You know, how many blinds I gotta sell to make 2 grand? Tax-free. 1, 2. So what's the next move? Gonna take those diamonds, spend a little time with them, figure out the rest. I gotta get this deal done in the next couple of days or it's dead and I'm not about to go back on my word with these Zimbabwe freaks. The visions come when they come up, I can't change that. You do what you do in that head of yours, but you do it quick. 24 hours. Understood? Alright. Sal and Terry will help you out with whatever you need. Here's my Burner number. Call it when we're ready to go. That's both our lives in your hands, right? I got this. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I got your money. - Hey. - Hi. I just came by to give you a little thank-you for you know, getting your ass kicked and the guy stole your booze. Plus, I don't really know anyone here and I thought you might wanna hang out or somethin'. Wow. And uh, it's... it's kind of inappropriate, but um, just wondering if I could use your shower. I mean the shelter looks really nice and all, but... So beer and thank-yous aside, but really you're just knockin' on my door to use my Sea Breeze body wash? Is that weird? Mm... Come on. Welcome to my abode. Wow! It's a cool place takin' it you live alone. Ouch! Is it that obvious? It could use a woman's touch in places. I'll keep that in mind. And I walked into the home of a serial killer. That's uh... it's how I get my thoughts out. It's a lot of thoughts. Are these your parents? Yeah, sort of. Um, that's my foster dad Elliot. And that's my mom. - That's really sweet. - Sweet? Yeah, it says somethin' about you. I don't know what that would be. Here you go. So are you still in contact with your mom or your foster dad? Um, no. Elliot... ...uh, he's a little overbearing, so... What about you? Your parents around? No. Anyways, I... I... I figure this life is up to me. I... yeah. Well, someday all that you see could be yours. Uh, you mentioned somethin' about Sea Breeze body wash. - Right. - As an option. Yeah, I did. Mmhmm. Okay. Watch your beer. Shit. Your reward. Oh yeah. And I can share yours. Yeah, that's what you think. What? What about him saying that he saw the handoff? You know, how many things are in that guy's head, who knows what he saw? Maybe he saw it handed to you. Ever think about that? That's right. That's right. Just for once, I wanna be the guy that gets the fuckin' prize in his hands, you know? You stay focused and that's exactly what's gonna happen. For the both of us. Now, I'm gonna be right here, engine running. You get in, take the bag, get the fuck out, nothing more. Okay? No blood. - Yeah, sure. - Hey, say it. I get in, get the bag, and get the fuck out. No blood. Yeah, but if something goes down and I... You wanna spend another chapter of your life in jail? This is our chance. We do this right, everything changes. Alright? The visions come when they come up, I can't change that. Oh. We gotta go. Get this on. - Come on, come on. - What are you... what? Don't get freaked out, but there is someone in my apartment. What? Come on, come on. ...on upper ground. Go, go on, go. Please, he's out there. I... I... what the fuck is happening? - Just please move out, okay? - Who is that? - Come on. - Open the door! Here, here. - Alright. - Open the fuckin' door! Oh fuck! Jesus, was that a gunshot? Just run, keep going. Come on, come on, come on, let's go. Just run. There's a ladder around the back. Sal, he's running. He's running, Sal! - Go, go, go. - Just tell me what the hell is happening. I will, but first let's just get out of here. Go, go. Head to the freeway. Who would be breaking in? I don't know. Hey! Fuck, did I tell you. Why do you have those? James? Been a while. Well, you can cut the bullshit, 'cause I can see it on your face. You're gonna black out on me every time I ask you a question? Gotta talk to Elliot. Elliot, what? - Wait, whoa. - Shit. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What is that? Pop the hood. How bad is it? There's a motel. Let that engine cool off for the night. If it overheats, it'll cease. Shit. Okay. Uh, he... he's gonna say somethin' about a motel, that we should let the engine cool down for the night - or it'll cease. - Who? The police. The police? - How did you... - Play it cool. Just do the talkin', alright? Good evening, folks. Everything alright? Yes, officer, just some engine troubles. You called for a tow? Uh, we don't have a phone. Looks like your cooling system. You'll probably get a dozen miles, but if it overheats, it'll cease. There's a motel, maybe a few exits down the road. Might be a good idea to let that engine cool off for the night. You folks have a good evening. How did you know? We should get to that motel. How'd you know he'd say that? Every now and then, I get lucky. James, come on talk to me. What do you wanna talk about? You wanna act like a dick and pretend like that didn't just happen? You dragged me out here. The least you can do is tell me the truth. Whatever. I see things. Like what? Things that haven't happened yet. Snippets or visions or whatever. What do you mean visions? Like déjà vu? It's more fragmented than that. I see... I see pieces. Happen when they happen and always come true. What did you see? I saw a gun firing and a bullet hitting me in the chest. Jesus. We should get off the road. Listen, after the car cools down, if you wanna drop me at Elliot's and get out of here, I understand. Charming. Uh-huh? I'll be back. Okay. Yeah. And we're back to the 7th round. What? I didn't take you for a sports fan. Well, it's one way to pass the time I guess. You bet on them, don't you? No, that would be immoral. Of course. - And I... - You are a stand-up guy. I am basically a saint, yes. I know, I've seen. Mmhmm. How long have you mm, been like this? My mother died when I was 7 years old, a car accident. I saw two months before it happened. You saw it? Why don't we listen to the radio... I drew it. Hey, what do you wanna listen to? Did you tell anyone? Did you try to stop it? Uh-uh, I didn't know what it meant. Oh! I can't imagine what that would have done to a kid. I drew everything I saw back then. I didn't realize that it wasn't just my imagination. I guess that's when I first knew. Knew what? That our choices don't matter. Life happens beyond our control. So all the shit that I grew up with... All that sadness... was fated. That's a shitty way of seeing the world. Doesn't mean it's not true. Did you see that coming? Do you reckon me? That's me. Yeah. Yeah. Oh fuck, no. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. This is impossible. How is this fucking is possible? We're not safe here. We gotta go, we gotta go. Angela, we gotta go. Come on, come on. I hope it's probably in the safe. Who... who could've gone into that safe? I don't know. Maybe the same guys who broke into my apartment. Maybe they got what they wanted and... And now things are gonna change. No, no. This is still part of it. Just stay on this road. Another half hour, we'll be at Elliot's. He's been trying to help me figure this out since I was kid. Hey. What are you doing here? Um... This is Angela. Hi. I'm Elliot. Come in. It's been a while. How you doin'? Alright. Just alright? Yeah. Well, you can cut the bullshit, 'cause I can see it on your face. Tell him. I saw my death. What? How did this happen? - Ray asked me to... - I warned you, didn't I? Elliot. He's a criminal, James. I had no choice, I needed the work... Of course, you had a choice. It's not what I saw. Oh, for God's sakes. Just because you see ahead of you does not mean that you're impotent to choose. That's a theory, Elliot. You know that's not how it works. I know how you work. You see a future, it's yours to steal, and you're gonna see a future where you're a crook, but you start applying yourself, and then your future changes. This is not why I came here. Where does this happen? Whatever he's done, I can sort this out for you. What did you see? No, please, no! Happens here. Oh my God. It's all in here, your drawings. Everything you've seen since we started working together. You've always seen this. Why didn't you tell me about this? Well, right now you've got to do everything in your power to change this. You've got to leave now. It makes no difference what I do. It never has. You really understand how his ability works. Well, it's more of an affliction, sadly. You make it sound like a disease. Just get him to leave. Please. Excuse me a moment. Is this me? Why didn't you tell me? I drew a lot of stuff back then. I don't... I don't remember half of it. So I'm a part of this. I've always been a part of this. Can I tell you something? That moment today, when we met on the street, you said that you'd seen me before. I believed you. You made fun of me for saying that. Well, it was a cheesy line to say. But I felt it, too. I can't escape what I saw. I'm not gonna accept that. We have to try. We have to at least try. - Come on, James. - Angela. Please. Hey, open up! Professor, let's go, open the door! Elliot? Elliot, we're gonna go. Now, listen to me. I think it's Ray, let me talk... Everybody stay where the fuck they are. Jesus Christ, I forgot what a mediocre place this was. - Ray. - Professor. Whatever he's done, I can sort this out for you. Elliot! Are you going somewhere, Jimmy? - Hey, don't touch her. - Hey, don't... don't touch me. 'Cause I'm pretty sure we agreed to meet under a different circumstance. Ray, I can fucking explain this, okay? Please explain to me when you decided to rip me off right before my fuckin' eyes. I didn't rip you off! Oh, then why did I get a call from Sal that you left your apartment? That you took off with the diamonds like they're yours. They're not even fuckin' mine, Jimmy! Ray, I know this sounds like bullshit, but they were stolen from me. Oh! Leave him alone! Please, no. I had the diamonds, okay? I was working on it and someone broke into my place. These guys were watching your place the whole time, Jimmy. And not because I don't trust you, but because this is a very big fuckin' deal we're doin' here. And they didn't see anybody break in. I offered you 100 grand, James. 100 fuckin' grand, because I wanted to do right by you, because I trusted you. You can trust me. I thought you said you saw this workin' out. - I did. - That you saw the handoff. - I did. - Then what the fuck happened? I don't know! - You know what I think? - No! I think you fuckin' lied to me right from the very fuckin' beginning. No, please, don't! I'm a dead man without those stones, Jimmy. You understand me? Brains-on-the-fuckin'-wall dead. Just tell me where they are. Tell me where you hid them and this will all be over. He's telling you the truth. Take Jimmy and the professor downstairs. Lock 'em up in the basement. Let's go. Let's see what the princess has to say. Move. I know what the fuck you think you're doin', but you try anything or say another fuckin' word, I'll personally kill you. - What're you talkin' about? - Understand me? I know you have 'em. What's this all about? You need money? Is that it? You know, I got a daughter about your age. She won't talk to me anymore, but... See the way I see this is... Well, my Jimmy's never acted like this before, ever, and then you come along and... You think I put him up to this? Well, you're the only variable, honey. They're secure. Alright, check the house. Check the whole fuckin' house. I'll check upstairs. Elliot. What... what happened? Where's Angela? They got her upstairs. What? No, she's not safe up there. What the fuck was that? You got somebody out there? Terry, check it out! Come on, let's go. Jimmy! Who the fuck is out there? Ray, I've told you everything I know! Well, you better start using that head of yours, Jimmy, 'cause I'm losin' my fuckin' patience here. What the fuck! Jesus fucking Christ! Jimmy, I swear to God! Who's out there, Jimmy? I have no idea, Ray. Well, someone's out there. Ray, I wouldn't fuck you over, man. Come on! I'm not deaf, Jimmy. I can hear what's goin' on. Who's out there? Hey, don't move! Ray, leave her alone! I don't have the fucking diamonds, I swear! Jesus Christ! What the fuck are you doin' out there? It's the fuckin' Zimbabwean. - Jimmy! - Ray! I told you everything I know. I swear... Oh, what the fuck? She has nothing to do with this. Jimmy. Sorry, kiddo. I wish I had time to explain this all to you. But it'll all make sense again. Please, God. It'll all make sense. Good evening. Where is everyone? You? Elliot? What happened to your beard? Elliot. Easy now. Did you drug me? How did you get this now? You... you injected me. I never told you what the serum was? What? This is gonna be... Hard to understand. Elliot. The serum in that syringe was... What? Are you sure you aren't part of some human-trans? Human-trans? What are you talking about? It's a time-travel agent. And it wasn't supposed to be like this. Any of it. Well, clearly, you've injected me with some really great, great drugs. Look. Here. Read this. October 12th, 1994. I'm not messing with you, I would not do that. Maybe it's time you learned the truth about your condition. For years, quantum physicists had spoken of ways of building a time machine. Negative energy, density was always a key component, but we found a means of isolating this energy and ultimately liquefying it. Now, meet Schrdinger, our very first test subject. We injected this serum into this brave little traveler which went directly to his amygdala. The results... Well... What just happened? The Einstein-Rosen effect. An unhinging of space from time. The serum was the mode of the brain and its memory construct the driver. We thought we detached him from temporality itself, but Schrdinger came back. And when he did, something incredible had changed. At first, we just thought he was showing signs of mental fatigue, but it was more than that. You see, Schrdinger had developed a knack for knowing when his next experiment was. Our tests showed that his brain lit up before an event even occurred. Schrdinger had developed... Clairvoyance. Sound familiar? Elliot. What are you doin' up, kiddo? I can't sleep. Come on, Jimbo, time for bed. You having bad dreams? I figure this life is... Let's go, okay? You alright? He was in my dream. The man downstairs? It's okay. Just remember the present is where we live, right? Each moment counts. So I'm like your rat. I'm sorry you're only finding out about this now and I... I know it's a lot to take in. You just needed a test subject. You scoured foster homes? Scoured foster homes? James, you sent me to find you. Why don't I remember that? Well, maybe... Maybe because it hasn't happened yet. Why didn't you tell me? I don't know. I don't know why I ever involved you in this, I don't even know when. But I have to believe there was a good reason. Good reason? That little boy, he's seeing snippets of my experiences and they become his future. Yes. A particle, split into two, no matter how it's pieces are separated, will always melt and combine. Everything that child sees and does is because you've done it. Then everything is fated. Well, that's my working hypothesis, yes. You told me for years that things aren't. I did. You drilled it into me, my choices! Who I associated with. You said I just needed to try, that nothing was fixed unless I let it be. But something did change. James. This was supposed to be my dead body. I saw it just like I see everything, but it didn't happen. She's the one who got shot. - Who's she? - Angela. She's... somehow Angela changed it. You were never shot. How does it work? The... the mechanism? How does it know to send me here or to the future? Oh, you can't go to the future. You can only in theory go to the past, events that the amygdala recalls, events that have emotional weight. But this event where she gets shot, it's in your future, but it's my past. Elliot, you always said that if I tried hard enough I could change my fate. Maybe this is where I do it. Stop her from getting killed or stop myself from saying "yes" to Ray. It's possible but I... Elliot, I gotta try. That boy up there, he couldn't do anything to save his mom. To save my mom. All because he got scared, paralyzed. I can't let that happen again. Not to her. I have to help her. Inject me again. The mind is the driver. You have to think and feel about where you want to go. Do you have something specific? Yeah. Good. And just one small dose per travel. Don't overdo it. Now, you remember, stay present and you'll be perfectly safe. Now, focus on where you wanna go. Feel it. Let your memory do the rest. You'll have to avoid your other self at all costs. Your mind... the driver... Don't overdo it. Shit! And we're back. Let's get those diamonds. Oh! Time's up, asshole. Jesus Christ. Ben. Ben, what the fuck? Look at my face, James. Do I look like a babysitter? I have your money, okay? Were you holdin' out on me? I was goin' to come by today, okay? 1, 2, th... - Angela. - Oh, oh, whoa. Where you going, man? Okay, okay, 3, 4, 5, 6, keep the change. Happy? Okay. That's not how it's gonna work, James. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I got your money. - Hey. - Hi. You wanna stay here? I'm gonna need an advance in next month's rent. You gotta be kidding me. Stop fucking me, you know what? There, happy? Yeah, well, you bring this shit on yourself, James. Oh, where are my keys? What about you? Your parents around? No. Anyways, I... I... I figure this life is up to me. Well, someday all that you see could be yours. Uh, you mentioned somethin' about Sea Breeze body wash. Right. Okay. Watch your beer. Shit. Hey, don't worry. I got it. Careful. Okay. Yeah, that's what you think. - Uh, towel? - Yeah. Towel's under the sink. You know about the God-awful mess. What about him saying that he saw the handoff? You know, how many things are in that guy's head, who knows what he saw? Maybe he saw it handed to you. Now, I'm gonna be right here, engine running. You get in, take the bag, get the fuck out, nothing more. Okay? No blood. - Yeah, sure. - Hey, no blood. We gotta go. Come on. James, what... Don't get freaked out, but there is someone in my apartment. - What? - Just come on, come on. Jesus! On the upper ground. Go, go, go. Go on, go on, please. Come on, come on, hurry, we gotta go. Please. - Open the door! - What is happening? Just... just... Open the fuckin' door! - You hear that? - Just... Hey! Oh fuck! Ugh, dammit. Jesus, was that a gunshot? Just keep going. Hey! Hey, stop! Just run. There's a ladder around the back. - Fuck you, Sal! - Jimmy. He's runnin', Sal. He's runnin'! Jesus, Sal! What is this? - Hey! - What are you doing? Fuck did I tell you? Sorry about that, kid. Uh, listen, there's been a change of plans. Uh, Ray and I, we spoke. He wants us to hang on to the diamonds now. Ray, doesn't change plans, Sal. We're just gonna come around, nobody has to get hurt. What the fuck? Go, go, go, go! Head to the freeway. Hey, is that that fuckin' chick? How the hell did he get there? Hey, where did he come from? Oh! I'm so sorry. I can't imagine what that would have done to a kid. Okay, getting the diamonds, give 'em to Ray. And this will all be over. You gotta be kidding me. You're looking for this? What the fuck are you guys doing? Where are the diamonds, James? Goin' back to Rays. Fuck Ray. Hey, keep your mouth shut. You're fuckin' him off, aren't you? You don't know what you're talkin' about. Like I said it's a change of plans. Ray doesn't change plans. What the fuck do you know about Ray? You think you know how that guy works? He's my cousin and I don't even know how that guy works. You know, what it's like losin' four years of your life? Hmm? I'm the one who got fucked over. So I need those stones, James. It's not gonna give me my time back. But it's a start. So you are... He's the rat. So you want a little piece of it? Huh? What's it to you who pays you? I can't give you 100 grand in cash, but I'll give you a lot more than that in stones. What do you say, scumbag? He kills her. He kills Angela. And I'm not gonna let that happen. That girl from the street? That's not our fuckin' problem. Hey, can you just let me fucking do this? I'm gonna help her, Sal. I'm taking those stones back to Ray. Uh-uh, I'm afraid... And you're not gonna fucking stop me. No, no, no. I'm afraid I can't let that happen. Move. I said "move". Oh! Jimmy, unlock it. Come on. Dingo was his name-o. Unlock it. Let's go unlock it. Jimmy, unlock it. Unlock it. I can't control what this guy does. Trust me, I've tried. I'm not even gonna look. Let me kill him, Sal. Let me put a bullet in his brain and let me kill this motherfucker. Just give me the word. Tell me I can kill him, Sal! Alright! Alright, alright. Alright. Dingo was his name-o. Terry, watch out! Oh! Oh! Shit, you motherfucker. Fuckin', you're a dead man, man. Don't fuckin' move. Don't you fuckin' move. You're a dead man, you punk. You fucking rat. Come on, get up. Come on, let's go. You gotta get up. Oh shit! Wait a second, isn't... Isn't Ray the other way? I think I know where he's goin'. You gotta call Ray before that motherfucker talks. Or it's over. Who's this? He took off. What did you say? With the fuckin' diamonds. I thought you were supposed to be keepin' an eye out on him. Oh, we did! He... he ran off. He ran off with some chick he met. Ran from his fuckin' apartment. And you didn't think to follow him? He surprised us, cuz. Look, he headed East, I know that. He's probably heading to that cardigan-wearing motherfucker. Okay, where are you? Elliot! Elliot, it's James. You and I have a lot to talk about. I wanted to tell you. I wanted to tell you every day. But? But I was hoping that somehow things would change, that you'd fixed everything that needed to be fixed, that you... you would avoid all that led up to... Did you end up saving her? I don't know yet. This isn't even my present. What? I mean it is my present, but I'm still in the past. Still in the past? I'm still traveling and this has already happened. At least, for me. Listen, there's another me. He doesn't know about any of this, but he's about to come over here telling you how he saw his own death, unless his vision has changed. His own death. But it doesn't happen to him, it happens to her. So once Ray shows up... Ray? - He shows up? - Yeah. Here? Why? These. These are his diamonds. This is all that he wants. So once he shows up, you let him know you have these and this will all go away. What? Such a mess. It's my mess. I'm the one who caused your affliction and even now I don't know when or why. You did the best you could. - They're here. - Who? The earlier me. Oh shit. Okay, I'm hiding these under your bed. Remember, give 'em to Ray right away. What are you gonna do? You can't be with your other self? I'll stay far away. Just play your part. Yeah, yeah. I'm coming. Hey. It's been a while. How you doin'? Alright. Just alright? Yeah. Well, you can cut the bullshit, 'cause I can see it on your face. Tell him. I saw my death. What? How did this happen? - Ray asked me to... - I warned you, didn't I? Elliot. He's a criminal, James. I had no choice, I needed to work... Of course, you had a choice. It's not what I saw. Oh, for God's sakes. Just because you see ahead of you does not mean that you're impotent to choose. That's a theory, Elliot. You know that's not how it works. I know how you work. You see a future, it's yours to steal, and you're gonna see a future where you're a crook, but you start applying yourself, and your future changes. One small dose per travel. There's another me. He doesn't know about any of us. He's about to come over here and tell you how he saw his own death. His own death. I've always been a part of this. Can I tell you something? This is gonna sound weird, but I won... That's her car. That's him. I'm not gonna accept that. We have to try. We have to at least try. - Angela. - We have to at least try. Professor, let's go, open the door! Elliot. Elliot, we're gonna go. Listen to me. I think it's Ray. Let me talk... Everybody stay where the fuck they are. Jesus Christ, I forgot what a mediocre place this was. - Go, get the diamonds. - Ray. Come on, Elliot. Professor. Whatever he's done, I can sort this out for you. Hey! Elliot! No. Are you going somewhere, Jimmy? No, don't touch me. 'Cause I'm pretty sure we agreed to meet under different circumstances. Ray, I can fucking explain this, okay? Please explain to me... When you decided to rip me off right before my fuckin' eyes. I didn't rip you off! Oh, then why did I get a call from Sal that you left your apartment? You fuckin' hearing me? - Sal. - Hey, I know you have 'em. - What are you talkin' about? - I know you have 'em. I'll fuck you up. You know, what I'm talking about. Sal. Let's go. I don't know. Hey, hey. You think I put him up to this? Why are they talkin'? Well, you're the only variable, honey. I don't fuckin' know. - What about his face? - What about his face? I hit him really fuckin' hard, man. You just focus on what you need to focus on. They're secure. Alright, check the house. Check the whole fuckin' house. I'll check upstairs. Oh fuck, I can't see anything. What... what happened? Where's Angela? They got her upstairs. No, she's not safe up there. You gotta do something. I'm sorry, Ray. What the fuck was that? You got somebody out there? Terry, check it out! Come on, let's go. Jimmy! Who the fuck is out there? Ray, I've told you everything I know! Well, you better start using that head of yours, Jimmy, 'cause I'm losin' my fuckin' patience here. What the fuck! Jesus fucking Christ! Jimmy, I swear to God! Who's out there, Jimmy? I have no idea, Ray! Well, someone's out there. What are you guys tryin' to pull here? Ray, I wouldn't fuck you over, man. - Come on! - I'm not deaf, Jimmy. I can hear what's goin' on. Who's out there? Hey, don't move! Ray, I don't have the fucking diamonds, I swear! What's wrong? What the fuck are you doin' out there? Jimmy! I'm sorry, Ray. Oh! Man, I just need like a dollar for lunch. Oh! Watch yourself, cowboy. Shit that I grew up with. ...is fated. I figure this life is up to me. There's still time. My choices! Who I associated with. You said I just needed to try, that nothing was fixed. But something did change. She's the one who got shot. Who's she? Angela. She... she saved me. Cool place, takin' that you live alone. Is it that obvious? It could use a woman's touch. I'll keep that in mind. I'm James. Angela. Okay, I meet her. Just get the other me away from her. I have to help her. Maybe this is where I do it. Get off me! Hey, asshole. Get the fuck out of here, fuckhead. Look, I don't wanna go through the motions here, but let's get this over with, huh? You hit me, I hit you. Mind your own fuckin' business. Believe me, man, I would if I could. Come on. Are you fuckin' kidding me? This is kind of where you're supposed to hit me. Get off me. Let's get out of here. Double-teaming me, huh? Oh! You really understand how his ability works. Well, it's more of an affliction, sadly. You make it sound like a disease. Please. Excuse me a moment. What are you doing here? I thought you were hiding the diamonds. That's an earlier me. Oh, watch it, easy! James. - What... what's happening? - You're beginning to fragment. I tried to change it. It's all fixed. It's all fixed, all of it. What? She always dies. No matter what I try. I cause it. I always have. No, no, no, no, no, listen to me, James. You're talking crap, it's bullshit! I'll give the stones to Ray. You just gotta stay strong. Stay present. Okay, kiddo. That's her car. That's him. I can't believe this shit. Professor, let's go, open the door! James, what's wrong? Why don't we listen to the radio, hey, what do you wanna listen to? I told mom not to drive that night. Why didn't she listen? Maybe she did. Maybe in that very moment all she could do was make a choice. And maybe your mom's choice, even with your warning, was the most courageous thing she could have done. Maybe she died, so you could live. Are you listening to me? Life for a life. You know what I think? No! I think you fuckin' lied to me right from the very fuckin' beginning. No, please, no! I'm a dead man without those stones, Jimmy. You understand me? Brains-on-the-fuckin'-wall dead. He's telling you the truth. Where's Angela? They got her upstairs. No, she's not safe up there. They're secure. Check the house. Check the whole fuckin' house. What the fuck was that? You got somebody out there? Terry, check it out! Come on, let's go. Let's go. Jimmy! Who the fuck is out there? Ray, I've told you everything I know! Well, you better start using that head of yours, Jimmy, 'cause I'm losin' my fuckin' patience here. Jesus fucking Christ! Jimmy, I swear to God! Ray, listen to me. She has nothing to do with this. Well, someone's out there. What are you guys tryin' to pull here? Ray, I wouldn't fuck you over, man. Come on! I'm not deaf, Jimmy. I can hear what's goin' on. Who's out there? Oh! Hey, don't move! Ray! Who's your boyfriend with, huh? - Who's out there? - I don't know. Where are the diamonds? Tell me, you motherfucker. I don't have the fuckin' diamonds, I swear! Tell me. I don't have them! What the fuck are you doin' out there? Even with your warning, it was the most courageous thing she could have done. Life for a life. Life for a life. Jimmy. What are you doin' down here? Jimmy. Sorry, kiddo. Put pressure on that. I didn't mean to shoot you. I swear to God, I didn't mean it. Holy shit. I found them under the bed. I thought you were supposed to lock him up downstairs. I did! Well, he's fuckin' here, isn't he? Where's Terry? Give me those fuckin' diamonds. You hid these? It's not... it's not what you think? - They tried to scam us. - That's bullshit. - They tried to scam us both. - Bullshit. You don't know what you're talkin' about. Well, what is he talkin' about? I don't fuckin' know. Look at him, he's delirious. Ray, it's true. Hey, you think I'm gonna fuck over my own cousin, asshole? It's true. It's true. It was fuckin' you, wasn't it, Sal? You're gonna believe this guy over me? - Did you, son of bitch? - Hey. Were you covering for your own loss? Get your fuckin' hands off me. Why did you fuckin' do that to me? I want the diamonds! Terry, take it easy. Like I said, no more blood. Come on. No blood. You motherfuck... What are you... what are you doing? What do you think I'm doin'? I told you, it's my family. No blood, I fuckin' told you! Let's get the diamonds, get the fuck out of here. Stupid choices, kid. Oh my God! Oh. Oh no. Jesus. Here. Hang in there. Hang in there. Elliot. How do you know my name? I c... I couldn't change it. I... it's all f... fated. Who are you? J... J... James. James. Oden. James Oden. Find me. E... Elton Hills. Foster... foster. Hold steady, hang in there. ELLIOT How did you get this in your bloodstream? They say when you die, your whole life flashes before your eyes. I wish it were that simple. Elliot once said that when you're in the thick of it... ...life is nothing but a collection of random events, crashing into each other, causing chaos and confusion. And that only in retrospect would we see it wasn't random at all. The adversity we faced, it was all there by design forcing us to define ourselves... ...not by our mistakes in the past... ...but by our choices in the present. Angela. Maybe it is that simple.
