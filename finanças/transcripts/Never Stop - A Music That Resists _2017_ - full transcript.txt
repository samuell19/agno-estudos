- When there will be no one to blame but yourself. The time has come and we must take responsibility for your own success or your own failure. Knock down your own barriers. Another page from the book called the mental machine. There will always be people standing in your way. There will always be people setting up roadblocks. There will always be people who put barriers in your way. On the other hand, there will be other people getting out of your way when they see you coming. There will be other people removing roadblocks. - There was a DJ on the radio named Electrifying Mojo who was very iconic and this was when FM radio was in it's infancy stage. Like in the mid-70s, they started FM and Mojo happened to get recruited by 107.5, which was WGPR. He must've came on around 1977 and there was only two other radio stations on the whole FM bandwidth. And after riot state, the government had to make a lot more things kind of accessible to urban or black youth or black people period. And so I guess this was kind of a bone that was thrown to black community, this radio station. So Mojo came on and it was no format because this was FM and it was all new. It was like people just on the radio doing whatever they wanted. And Mojo was on every night, weeknight, from 10 p.m. to three a.m., every weeknight, Monday through Friday. He was off on weekends, but he definitely had a huge impact on Detroit and actually, eventually, the whole nation, because there was no other radio station or other DJ in the whole country that was doing what Mojo was doing. - Yes, there will be other people knocking down barriers. Remember, the tallest barrier that will ever by around you is the barrier that you erect. The tallest person that will ever stand in your way is the person that you look at in the mirror every day. Knock down your own barriers and the others will disappear. Another page from the book called The Mental Machine. - One thing about American radio, everything is so separated. You got the rock stations, you got the urban stations. Basically white and black stations, country, classical, everything is separated. And this was the first kind of DJ or radio station that was played our record first because he had that much power. And anything he played, especially from a new artist, he's the one that broke Prince here. And it was like people thought we were from Europe and it's like no, we from right here. And it was like a smash success. The height of the Industrial Revolution, the height of industrial age. I mean Detroit was a big place, man, 'cause the car industry was booming, jobs and unions and auto unions and things were forming. Then when industry came to a close, of course the city kind of went down. I think a lot of good music and a lot of great art and creativity comes from depressed and stressful situations and I think the city of Detroit is very instrumental in my development. I don't think I could've developed the same way in any other city. In 1980, I was 17 years old and I met Rick Davis, who became my partner in Cybertron. We started a group called Cybertron around '81. But my most progress happened before I even before I met Rick, which is the other half of Cybertron. Before I ever, I mean I was still a senior in high school and this was the time when I was sitting at home everyday. When I got home from school, tinkering with, I think I had a Korg MS10 synthesizer that I talked my Grandmom into buying me for Christmas one year. These days after days and hours after hours I was working on this Korg MS10. It's probably the most in my entire life, entire career, was the most productive period. And I brung these demos that I was making with this Korg MS10 to class, 'cause I was taking all music courses and everything. And everybody in the class loved these demos and everybody wanted to hook up with me because of that. And Rick was the only one that I knew that was working with synthesizers and sequencers. So like that's the guy I want to hook up with. But he had a record out already called Methane Sea and his label was called Deep Sea Records. When we hooked up, we made our first record made together was called Cosmic Rain Dance and this was around the end of 1980. And so later on we did Alleys of Your Mind and we released it on our own label, which of course I got the idea from him. And so this is what sparked the idea to start Deep Space Records and release this record that we made together. It was definitely, it was very early on and it was definitely a new thing for me because no one ever knew that you could release your own record, you know? When I was in high school I took a class called Future Studies because I was always interested in futuristic and technology and stuff like this so I thought this was a cool course to take. And basically what it was was studying how the future would impact society and life. So the reference book in that class was called Future Shock by Alvin Toffler. One of the things that he talked about how white collar jobs will probably move more like work out of your home. They call it the techno village and then there was another concept that he discussed about how cities, like Detroit and Chicago, would grow so big that they would eventually become one city. And what they called that the Detroit Chicago Metroplex or Metro Complex. And so basically that's where the name came from. Combining two major cities to become one city and call it a Metroplex. Basically what you do is that you record your music down to two track tape. And then we would send the tape to get mastered. And then what they do is they make a lacquer and then they make plates from this lacquer. They take this lacquer and literally dip it in liquid metal and when the metal hardens, the grooves are in the metal. And they peel it off and make stampers out of this and it literally what it does is it stamps the record out. And they send it to the pressing plant and it stamps out. So because it's hot when they stamp that and they need the right kind of paper that doesn't' bleed, the ink doesn't bleed, I can remember this vividly. He had to tell me what kind of paper, so I had to go to the paper store and buy this paper for these labels. And take them to the printing. First couple of times it wasn't the right paper so I had to go back and find the right paper and then we had to print on one side of the paper, 'cause this special paper was glossy on one side and flat on the other. So you had to make sure that it was printed on the proper side. So we had to go through that process, but after a while, I became an expert on finding the right paper and the ink. And then I had to take them to Archer, which is the pressing plant in Detroit. So that's the whole process. And after you get your physical records made, then because Mojo was playing the record, we getting calls from all the local record stores that wanted to get the record in. So we literally put the boxes of records and drove to all the stores and put records in the stores here in Detroit. And it was just a Detroit record at the time but eventually, it got popular. And then we moved out to Cleveland and then we got picked up by a bigger record company that was able to put the records out nationwide. I mean let's face it. This is the top of the pyramid in terms of capitalism, commercialism, sales, profits. You know, that's, America basically invented that almost. So it's like by everything here being so predicated on selling and commercialism and, you know, it's just there's no room for true innovation because bottom line is the bottom line and a lot of the major companies and music companies, it's not about the music. It's about the bottom line. Our second record, Cosmic Cars, we released the record in '82. The record, of course it was taking off here in the city and it was this WCHB chart based on sales. And they also played records based on sales. So this chart, when our record, Cosmic Cars came out, we went to number one. On that same chart that week, Little Red Corvette by Prince was number two and the major labels were upset because this little independent, little company from nowhere is number one. And here is an artist that's on, I think he was on Warner Brothers, with all of the major resources behind it. And here's the number two. So this is why this number is sitting up here and Prince is number two, because things are changing. This is like a new sound come in. But of course, the major companies, they were really upset by that. This is nothing that they wanted to see. After our first record, anybody that bought that record also was wondering like I want to do the same thing. Kevin and Derek and people that were my closest friends. When they saw the success and girls wanted to go out with me, they wanted the same thing. All of my closest friends saw this stuff firsthand, so of course, they started making music. So now, instead of one record, Alleys of Your Mind, now you got four or five records to choose from. People who comin' in record store don't have a fortune. They not gonna necessarily buy all four or five. So that's the first thing that happened. And of course, that didn't stay with just us three. All of a sudden it just snowballed nationwide so you got different DJs and producers all over the country making records. So eventually the competition just expanded and that was probably one of the main things that will reduce your sales right off. And then not only was it the competition affecting each other's sales, it was affecting the major record labels sales as well. So they thought they would develop this concept, this format, that when the CD first came out it wasn't like you could go, like when you press a record, you could just go the pressing plant and press a record. It was virtually impossible for independent to make an actual CD. So they tried to kill the independent vinyl market with the CD. - Juan had this idea when we were just 14, 15 years old, that he was gonna one day have a record label and call it Metroplex records. He hadn't even made his first record yet but he knew one day he was gonna do that. And once he finally did, I was more less his protege. He was my friend, I was there for whatever he needed, but I sort of put myself in the position of protege. And I watched him run his record label, go to the record pressing plant, press the records, design the labels and get the artwork done and mix the record, send it off to the pressing plant. Everything, I watched the whole process. So I realized it was feasible, it was possible to do it as well. But at the time when I first started trying to make music and Juan was there as my counsel, I got to the point where I felt like I knew enough that I didn't want to be counseled anymore. I didn't feel like waiting. It's typical. It happens for the mentor and the protege. It just happens. And that was really my motivation to starting my own record label. And with Juan, of course I wasn't just going to break away, 'cause he's my friend. So I decided to call the label Transmat because he had made a song called, "Night Drive." And in the song Rick Davis is saying in the lyrics, time, space, transmat. And that's where it came from. And of all my records on the Matrix inside the record, it says MS1, MS2, MS3, MS4, on and on to each record. Well basically the MS stands for Metroplex Subsidiary. It is completely a tribute to Juan that I do that. I wouldn't imagine ever changing that. That would be there in forever. The success that Juan received so fast, it was incredible. The amount of records he was able to sell and how he was able to really inspire a complete movement, especially in the Detroit area, I mean without a doubt. After Juan had so much of a response and immediate success and appreciation, and no one knew his face. They knew his music but not his face. There was no media blitz. There was no television interviews. There was no music magazines that were celebrating Juan. It was a few small reviews but the music was just a magnanimous success in the community. And it just inspired and fueled this thing in me and Kevin and everybody else. Knowing how to do it, knowing the business, understanding the marketing and the strategizing and the developing of it, we didn't get it. We didn't understand that part of it. We just thought you make a great record and you put it out. Now the romantic part of that is that it was the truth. It was the absolute truth of the matter back then. It was always made to seem so difficult to put your own music out and you need a record label. You need to go to Warner Brothers, or you need to go to Geffen Records or Sire Records back at the time. And that was our original ambitions. But when record companies finally did call us, they weren't calling us to put our records out. They were calling us to make other people's records better so they could put 'em out. We felt left out. We felt resentment. We felt rejected and I think that fueled this sort of eternal fire in us that made us feel that we had more to prove to ourselves than to anybody else. Today's technology makes it very simple for anybody to make music. I'm not trying to take anything away from any kind of artist period. But it is of a totally different nature now than it was. We took time to program your sounds and to really develop your own algorithms and to customize the keyboard to the point where it was a signature of you. Almost like you were signing on a piece of paper. This was your sound. This was your personality. This was your identity. I was always a DJ as a kid but I wasn't playing records. When I first made my record, I did . Clubs were not paying for international DJs. It was an ideology that just did not exist. So the dedication to making the music was easy. You just stayed home and you just worked. I'll never forget the first time somebody asked me to play records. I was in London and I got a call from my manager who was in Birmingham, England. And he called me and said, "Derrick, there's a club down in London called Heaven "and they want to know would you like to play some records?" I said, "What? "Play records?" I had never ever been a guest DJ in a nightclub before. I didn't even have a record bag. There was no record bags. There was no record bags. You know? It was a few record boxes but there was no record bags and there was none of that. It didn't exist. So the first days were incredible and they were also distracting, because here you were able to make money for doing something that you truly loved as well as making music. But you made it ever easier than making music. So it just became easy money in a sense. Fun and easy money, which is probably one of the biggest problems with the DJ world now. Most of these guys are not DJs anyway. That's another story. I don't travel in America. I maybe play in America five times a year. I play in Europe maybe 300 times a year. That means flying back and forth from Detroit. Staying over extra days in Europe. Missing time away from home. Constantly in hotels. Dealing with different clubs, different promoters. Meeting people every single week. It's a lot of work. And you need to love what you do at this point or you can't do it. I didn't ever stop wanting to sell records and stop wanting to look for new talent. But I shut the record company down in a sense because I was disgusted with what was happening with the vinyl movement. I was disgusted where record stores were disappearing left and right. And I felt that people were moving too fast away from a generation of people that enjoy buying records, enjoyed listening to music, just to accommodate a group of people that nobody knew would buy music yet. I mean, I don't blame Mr. Napster. I don't blame any of those people that tried to introduce a new format to the music industry. I blame the music industry for not paying attention and laughing, because that, once again, we're not even part of a major record label. We're not even working with major record companies. We're not even involved with them. But yet what they did and the way they handled that situation affected everybody. It had a resounding loud big bang effect on everyone in the music industry. To the point where record stores just collapsed. The music industry just collapsed on top of itself. And it really was disgusting to watch it happen. A lot of talented people just fell out of the business. Lost their lives. Musicians left and right lost opportunities. So it was, to watch one level of it fall down and another level of it slowly rise definitely gave me the attitude where I didn't want to be a part of it for a while. So it was about three to four years that I decided to bring the label back. And just sort of slowly developed things. And why would a city like Detroit fuel such a futuristic vision of what music should be? Or what it would be? What caused that and how are we somehow be able to interact with the world with the music? That is why we have this thing that we call Detroit techno, which has cultivated and recultivated and recultivated to something now that yeah, it's outta control. It's all over the world. It's mutated into good and bad and ugly. But it comes from here and the origins of it are still here and the people that made it are still here and thriving and doing well. Detroit is unique for this. It's like a creative pool that was left untouched. It's this sort of, it's like a rainforest of electronic music. Like all the stars came together, like click! And here we all are together. Now will this ever happen again? I can't tell you . Say la vie, huh? - The surroundings definitely impact your being, your personality. At least in my music my feelings going towards like growing up in the hood and all of Detroit became pretty much the hood. This dead building that's there and nothing's gonna happen to it. It's just gonna end up getting worse and worse and worse. And unless you can do something about it then you can. And like Derrick and Stace and Kevin and Kenny and I have all had these conversations over the years about how Detroit can be better. And we have these grand ideas of what could be done, but it comes down to that we took those ideas of what we could do with the future and earn money in a way that we know how to, which is by DJing, traveling, running our labels and stuff. And try to beautify Detroit in our ways of how people perceive Detroit from the outside . And if my children are going to be in Detroit as adults, then I'd like for them to have a place that feel like a metropolis. It's like Chicago has been for all my life . Or New York and Manhattan. Detroit has that possibility but then we had 30 years off . And now we've got it coming back. By the negative thing that's happened by the riots, I think something really amazing and positive came from it which is that Detroit became one of the really first black cities, and it taught that empowerment that you feel that you can do your business and be strong during it. You feel like there's something that's backing you up in relation to it. Whether it's the legacy of Motown or whether it's just this kind of you know that everybody around you is grinding and they're trying to do things that are, you know, the good people are trying to do good things. The bad people you trying to stay out of the way. - Okay, . I started Planet E because I needed my own creative independence. When I was doing music for Transmat and learning under Derrick, I think I learned a lot about independence from him. And that's how I started Planet E. I just so happened to be watching a documentary on the moon landing. As I'm watching the movie, a radio discussion between the astronauts and ground control. It's like, okay, communication. Planet Earth seemed like it was obvious to me but I like to be a little vague about things. So I just used E for Earth and I think that it worked out to my benefit as well, because it let people's imaginations go wild. So I would get people asking me what E meant. If E meant a drug of if you meant Earth or if you meant something else. And my answer was always it means whatever you want it to mean. When I'm in the studio on my own I can listen to a loop of the same thing for eight hours, no problem. And just makin' little tweaks and doing little things there to try to delve into what I'm doing and feeling. As the loop is playing I'm hearing different things happen. It can be a form of meditation in some ways. It just depends on if you're listening to it clinically, or if you're listening to it spiritually. It is a trance, it's a meditation that's happening when I can get spiritually into it. But people aren't gonna appreciate standing in front of me for eight hours playing the same loop . So I have to be a little more active about what I'm playing and how I'm playing it to the people so they can at least appreciate what I do. Of course now after all these years there's so many elements that are involved in running a label that goes far beyond what have ever had the capacity of doing, but you really need a big corporation in order to do what Warner and Def Jam and all these labels have done over the years. In Detroit, we've pretty much mastered the boutique label and everyone here in Detroit runs their own label. And I was fortunate to walk into the business at a time when Detroit records were selling quite well and there were some good distributors. And we could sell a ton of records through one or two avenues. Of course when the sales started decreasing, with vinyl especially and the file sharing thing and whatever, it became more difficult to navigate that path. And with what we've been able to do online, it's been great because you open people's eyes to it and they can get to us a lot easier. But unfortunately the numbers aren't nearly the same for the kind of things that we do as when you have the record in a store and somebody gets it and they go, okay, this is something that's special. I see that it's marble color vinyl. You know, I see that these guys took time to pay attention to it and the music's quite interesting. But then that you're fighting against so many other products out there that are being made so fast that you can download so easily. In many cases you can download for free. Haven't been able to find an optimal advantage of selling over the internet versus what we had been doing with distributors. But when you're an artist run label, you have that commodity that you can go out on the road. You can sell what you do in another way. The U.S. is a rock'n'roll society. In the U.S. we had disco movement that was around the time of, peak of disco music. And there was never that in Europe. I believe that it was easier for Europeans to hear house music and techno music and say okay, I get it, in comparison to U.S. people. When it was happening, they were like, oh yeah, this is just disco music. You know, disco music is ah, ah, sucks. Give me rock and roll all day long, you know, that kind of thing. So it's made it difficult to have a great representation of electronic music in the United States. And then as time went on and where the DJ came in was the DJ played the music that was already prerecorded for the people. And then it became improvising on top so whether it would be an MC that would talk over the top of the record or someone scratching on the record. So then it became more of an ownership of the style by the DJ. And now the way DJing is is that many a times, people are making new things live as a DJ in the same way as someone would do in the studio. - Here? - I think a lot of people don't quite understand because it's like oh well, you're playing somebody else's music as a DJ but when I remix a track, I didn't write the track, so I'm actually playing their music. I'm just creating something on top. And now DJing has probably become more of a live remix. So maybe that's what I should go by instead of DJ is just remixer, you know? 'Cause I do that onstage as well as I do that in the studio. - The social history and the atmosphere in Detroit had always been very different, very special from other cities. It was really unique that young kids would be able to have their own type of party, to socialize amongst themselves. And so for me, I started going out regularly I suppose by maybe the age of 11 or 12. And my older brothers and sisters did the same but at different type of levels of parties. And my parents also did the same. We were listening to any and everything. It was strange. At certain songs that would make everybody excited. I don't know why that was. And some things were often influenced by movies. The American Gigalo was a really influential film. And very much connected to Detroit techno that people wanna mention. But that was a very influential film and the Eyes of Laura Mars, that was also an influential film. So we would listen to the soundtracks of those films and researched to find out who made it. Sometimes it was Giorgio Moroder, sometimes it was some other producer and we would play this music at these parties. And it was kind of shaping a certain type of mentality. A certain type of, we felt that we were kind of moving out of Detroit and out of the soul, the very typical soul music influence and moving up and out into other realms of music. And this was also reinforced by Mojo was also doing the same on the radio. So we thought that what we were doing was really cutting edge. Well for me to start running an independent label, it started a few years before forming the Underground Resistance. Tony Schrock and me, we got together to form a label called Full Effect Records and that experience was bad. So that led me to rethink the idea of purpose of having a label and I met Mike and got to forming Underground Resistance. So it didn't take very long to get started. Many people are connected to the music industries. And all these engineers were still in the city. We could master the record and press the record in our own city. That was something that was quite special and we thought we should take advantage of, you know? But once we pressed the record and we get the copies here, then what do we do with it? How do we get this record to the record shop in Germany? Or how do we get this record shopped in Japan? How do we, we didn't know anything about distribution. So we, Mike and I took a few trips down to speak to Juan and then we went to Derrick's, Derrick May's place. And asked them how do you do that? So they told us as much as they could, so we said okay, where do we find distributors from? So what I did, I went to the library and found a directory of all the distributors in the country of music, which was about at the time, about 500 distributors of music. And wrote a letter to 500 distributors and hoped that we'd get a response from the ones that were interested in the music that we were making. About 20 replied back. Then I decided to leave Underground Resistance because of an offer to move to New York to be a resident at a big club called the Limelight. This was around 1992. That was when I started Axis Records. And then I realized that it wasn't one label that I really wanted to create. But it was actually various labels and be more active and not feel so confined to one particular sound if I had multiple labels to work on consistently. And so I ended up turning to be four labels. So the first label which was called Axis, the first point, was to be music that would be designed for you to think about. For you to listen and to you to absorb mentally. The second label was to be designed almost solely for the physical aspect of it. So really dance music and that was called Purpose Maker. And the third label was dedicated to conceptual work and that label was called Tomorrow. Everything on this label would be pertaining to the future and future works and future ideas. And then the fourth label I left open. I'm gonna try to interpret what I see on this vinyl record here. And so looks like the first song begins with obviously more than one instrument. The band, but not the full band, meaning that that's probably some type of introduction part. But then about two and a half minutes in, I see one groove, which means that it's probably a solo instrument that's playing without the backing of the orchestra. Then it goes to a break. It looks like a percussion break or somethin'. And then it breaks down to a sole instrument, which leads to another chorus part, short chorus part and then another single instrument to another chorus part, a little bit longer. So it's important to know how to read the grooves on vinyls when there's no map. You have to know when things are gonna happen. That's the important thing when you're a DJ because you know that you've got about a minute before something's gonna happen and you can get another song in. Throughout that whole dark time in the record industry I decided that if my company, if Axis is going to survive, I need to find another reason to make music. I need to find other ways to release vinyl records or CDs or whatever. I needed to change the parameters in which the label functions. And so before that collapse really happened, I was of course very conscious of what people were saying and what they were saying about digital file sharing. How great it was. You could have 10,000 tracks all in one file and you don't need to buy anything anymore. So I had begun to think about what I should do. And one thing that I did was I had figured that we had arrived at a point where there were a certain amount of collectors. So guys, people that loved electronic music but loved it much more than the average person. The ones that would not buy one copy, but would buy two because they didn't want to open the second copy. Or people that really looked at and read the information on the album covers and looked at the label for any clue of any message or anything. So I decided that the label should focus more on those type of people. So some releases we decided not to press thousands of units, but only hundreds. In some cases, only a box of 25, and we would tell the distributor you can only have two. And you choose the two best people that come into your shop and you sell it to them. And so we had different variations of the quantities of music that we were doing. Which was making the music even more special and it was the bottom line at the end of the year that we calculated and we end up making actually more money doing it that way. And we were changing the parameters of advertising a release but advertising the concept of why the release exists in the first place. So the subject is about Orion stars. That's a story and that project consisted of a vinyl, it consists of a book, it consists of other things. But what you're buying is not a 12 inch. What you're buying is actually the concept of Orion. And so we were changing the narrative of what an independent label should do. One project called The Sleeper Wakes, and the Sleeper Wakes is a science fiction story that I wrote and each chapter of the story, we play out in an album form. In one was a project about a story called Jungle Planet. And so in the story there is a flat land area which was kind of populated by animals, but these are not your typical animals. These were things that were of a shape of a black cube. This idea of rethinking what animals are was how I used this to create this cube. And the cube is what we used as the format, install the music in, that the person buying it would actually have. So it's not just the music, but you would then have the pet from the story. Another chapter is called Emerging Crystal Universe that will be the symbol of the changing of time. If you buy this album, if you buy this unit, this record, and view this crystal that's embedded inside of it, you will see the change of the universe. I'm not convinced that I'm only supposed to do one type of thing, or a few types of things. I'm more convinced that I should be able to do whatever I want at any time, for any reason. And I don't need to tell you or explain. That's the freedom I think I have, not being connected to a company or anyone that's gonna tell me, that's the beauty of being an independent. And being an independent artist and so using all the freedom that you have to be able to do anything you want. And so I think I'm just practicing with the freedom that I've been given by not signing my signature and name on someone's contract. And I can walk out of here and create 18 labels tomorrow and okay , it's completely valid and if I can produce the music for 18 labels, done. And the result of that, I don't know. I don't care 'cause next week I'm gonna make 24 labels. And then I'm gonna quit the week after and go play, be a professional tennis player.
