You know who would be perfect to direct this? And it kills me to say it... because l don`t relish the idea of working with him, but... ...my ex-husband. -Val? -Val`s perfect, given this material. -She`s right. This is his kind of story. Look, l love Val. l love him. But with all due respect... ...he`s a raving, incompetent psychotic. -He`s not incompetent. They should lock him up, throw away the key. Don`t take it the wrong way. Forget it. We`re gonna wind-up US$ 20 million over budget... ...and maybe no picture to boot. -That`s right. l did a picture with him when l was at Firestone. He didn`t even finish the movie, he had a nervous breakdown. Wait a minute! He was under a lot of stress, we had just broken up... He was fired off a picture here at Galaxie, just before l took over. -His demands were outrageous. -He`s a perfectionist. The light had to be perfect. The sun had to be just right. He demanded that they replace the leading lady. He wanted to reshoot dailies every other day. He fired the cameraman. Finally, he came down with shingles. They shut down the picture and found another director to finish... You don`t have to tell me about that, l was married to him at the time. -But that was ten years ago, Hal! -His best pictures were 1 0 years ago. Then he became a real artiste. l am the last person to defend that craziness, because it drove me nuts. But Val cares about movies, and he was born to do this material. Ellie, what are we discussing here? Shingles, headaches. -Why open a can of worms? -But he`s mellowed. l`m telling you. Who better to direct this? The streets of NY are in his marrow. Let me just say this: Ruth. -Yes, Ruth! -No way! What about him? He`s great. l know we could get him. He`d be safe. We can put our foot on his neck. Martin Ruth. That`s true. Val hasn`t worked in years. We could make a good deal. -We`ll have to watch him like a hawk. -We`re gonna lose a lot with Val. l agree with Ellie. l think he`s the ideal director for this project. -But we`re not gonna use him. -Right. -Who needs trouble? -Very good. Besides, what makes you think he`d want to work with us? l`m told that he`s in no position to be fussy. l can`t stand it here! What the hell am l doing in Canada? Lori, they got moose up here! Moose. Are moose carnivorous? My God! How could you be homesick? You got there... yesterday. You`re coming home tomorrow. Val? We`re good to go here. Waiting on you. Did my agent call? Any word on that TV movie? The interracial abortion, gene-splicing thing? l think the TV movie decided to go with Peter Bogdanovich. 0h, that`s great. That`s just great. You know, l love Peter. Peter`s a beautiful guy. God bless him. Val! The client wants more overhead coverage of the spray cans. 0ne minute. Lori, this is humiliating. l`m up here shooting a deodorant commercial. l got two 0scars. Up here you don`t need 0scars, you need antlers. Here`s a funny script about two kids in a college fraternity... who invent a machine that can turn women back into virgins again! lt`s very clever. What`s the matter? When you asked me to come out here for you, you promised me... l wasn`t just going to be one of those women who finds properties and... goes to lunch 500 times developing them and never gets one made. Honey, ``The City That Never Sleeps`` is green-lit, and that`s been... ...your project from day one. -Yeah, sure. Till l suggest the director. And then even though you admit he`d be perfect for it, l get shot down. -You didn`t get shot down, honey. -That`s a risky, but inspired choice. l think you`re trying to help him because you feel guilty. Guilty? Why should l feel guilty? Because l fell in love with you? l mean, God knows l put in enough years in that marriage... -That`s right. You did nothing wrong. -l know! l brought up his name because he`d give you the best movie for that script. -Nobody argued that. -He`s probably so angry, he won`t... speak to you, and he`s liable to ruin the picture just to get even with me. You`re wrong about that, l`m telling you. He would be grateful. -He needs a comeback, and... -This is a very, very expensive film! lt`s got solid box office potential. He can do it. You don`t regret leaving him, do you? You know, one day you look up and realize that laughs are not enough. l can handle him, Hal. l just got tired of having to, all the time. And then, you know, then l met you. -What are you doing home? -l quit. No! Val, not again! You quit over nothing again? -Not over nothing. 0ver a big thing. -What? They fired me. That was big enough to quit over. Val, that`s just great! l got the last plane out of Toronto. Have you ever seen Canada? Now l know why there`s no crime up there. Boy, l must say, you don`t seem too enthused over seeing me. What are you gonna do now? Sit around, talking about the... ...good old days? -l gotta get a picture. Somebody`s got to take a chance on me. This is ridiculous. When you`re cold, you`re cold. Fortunately, my business manager put away... enough money before he went to prison. -So l could hold out another 3 weeks. -Your agent called. You know, if you`d come up there for me, it might`ve been different. Two people in that sleeping bag is a lot cozier than one. -And who goes on for me? -lt`s an off-off-Broadway play! You`re in the last stages. Your understudy could`ve gone on for you. Are you kidding? My understudy? And that will be the one night... that Steven Spielberg comes to see the play. -0r Harvey Weinstein. -They`re not coming, they`re fasting. l would`ve been so good in that Shakespeare movie. What`s that? These are pelts. l traded with a fur trapper, so the trip wouldn`t be a total loss. Your agent sent over that script. A script? Why didn`t you tell me about this? ``The City That Never Sleeps``. When did this come in? Well? What did you think of it? l thought it had definite potential, a really good Manhattan feel to it. You know, they`re interested in you directing. You know, that`s fine with me. This is the kind of material that l can really do great. This is, you know, l can make this script sing, this is New York... it`s the nightclubs, the skyline. You want some water? l`m very excited. -Who wants me? -We have a little selling to do... but... Galaxie is making it. -Hal Yeager? -Yes, that`s right. -He stole my wife. -She`s the one who`s pushing for you. Pass. l`m not gonna work with Hal Yeager and Ellie! You gotta be kidding, he`s a Philistine and she`s a quisling. -lt`s a religious conflict. -Will you calm down? lt`s everything you`ve been looking for. You know, l`m frankly flabbergasted they would even think of me. Well, they didn`t think of you. She did. And she has convinced Yeager to fly to NY and take a meeting with you. -This guy stole my wife. -He doesn`t hold that against you. -lt`s business. -Can you believe... that she would leave me for Hal Yeager? l still can`t get my mind around it, ``Mr. Slick Stick``... The price of his haircut could feed a family of five. Calm down. You`re getting all red. Would you calm down? An you`re telling me that she... He doesn`t want me? She`s the... The nerve of them. He`s such a manicured phony. May he fall on his blow-comb and get hot in the wrong place. Please, Val. Please don`t do anything to kill this. -lt`s a golden opportunity. -Forget it. l would rather do the geriatric diaper commercial l turned down. Would you? Because that`s what the future holds, if this falls through. 0f course l wouldn`t. This is a terrific script. l, you know... Make some sense now... A US$ 60 million-dollar, first-class feature film. A big payday, which you need. And if you score with this one, you`re back on top. You`ll never have a gift like this drop in your lap again. -Just take the meeting with Yeager. -And Ellie? Yes, and Ellie. l`m telling you, l`ll get you half a million dollars. A lousy half-mil they`re offering? They want to buy prestige at the Shrine Auditorium for half-mil? -lt`s not an offer yet. -l reject their offer! -There`s nothing to reject. -Well, l reject it anyhow. You better meet with him and be nice, or else l`m out of here. l get an offer that`s worthy of my gifts, and look where it comes from. There is no offer yet, and l`m so tired of all this! The big talk about how big you were ten years ago. Things change, and you can`t get work. -Part of me wants it so badly... -And the other part? Also wants it. That`s the problem. -lt only takes one hit. -l know. -And l want a role in this movie. -l don`t have the movie yet. He`s gotta meet me and throw his weight around first. And not just a little bit. Something where l can show off what l can do. Lori, l can`t stick my girlfriend in the movie. l`m not just your girlfriend. l`m good! Remember all those times l told you you should take acting lessons? l`m a natural. Classes would ruin me. She feels guilty about dumping me, this is her way of clearing her conscience. Great! What`s the difference how it came about? This whole thing is creepy, Lori. l was married to her for 1 0 years. We made love. l`d hold her head over the toilet bowl when she threw up! -From making love with you? -No, from eating sushi. For God`s sake, l used to hug her when she was afraid of flying. And, you know, l kissed her on top of the Eiffel Tower. l swam in the moonlight with her. Now suddenly l got to meet her? l`ve got very mixed feelings. This guy has to show me he`s changed. He`s not in a position to make extraordinary demands. Because it was over for him years ago. He hasn`t touched anything for years. Garbage! l`m telling you, garbage. -l`m not saying that as criticism. -The question is: do l wanna let this has-been make his comeback picture on my money? He`s not. He`s a very good director who`s fallen on some difficult times. He brought it on himself. He`s his own worst enemy. Look, think of the press angle. ``Val does his comeback film for Galaxie``. -He`s always good press. -What good is it if he ruins the movie? -He`s not gonna ruin the movie. -He`s not, because l`ll fire him. l`m not going to take temperamental antics from some ``owteur`` genius. -``Auteur``. -Whatever. 0kay ``auteur``. You`re doing a jack story, okay? He can do this film better than anybody l can think of. We`ll see. -You`re nervous. Making me nervous. -l`m not nervous, l`m tense. -You are nervous. -l`m tense. When l`m nervous... l bite my nails. When l`m tense, l do this with my collar. Just act. Calm down and act professional. l am. l`m fine. But this is a guy who stole my wife. Years ago, l would never have consented to make a film for him... and now suddenly l`m auditioning for him? lt`s crazy. l would kill... for this job, but l want to kill the people who are offering it to me. -lt`s just insanity. -What is that? Remember in the cab l took a blue pill? Well, that was to calm my anger. But it had speed in it. So then l took another pill after that to calm down the speed. Well, this gets me back up to speed, where l want to be... ...actually for the meeting inside. -Great. Perfect. Then that other pill l took keeps me dry when it`s raining out. -Ellie! -Hello, Al. -How wonderful to see you. -So good to see you. Hello, Val. Hello, Val. -Al. -Ed. how are you? Nice to see you. -You know Val. -How are you? l`m so glad you could get here. Are you still having power failures? l read that there was a terrible power failure in California. -Can l get you something to drink? -Coffee. Coffee would be great! -That electricity was going off. -Come on in. -Since when do you wear suits? -You have any milk? -You never wore suits. -Yeah, with cream. -Val, you look very good. -l`m okay, you know. l`ve been having some back spasms and l have a torn rotator cuff... and my knee. l got... You know, l got a hearing loss. it`s the oddest thing, in my left ear... -Funny, isn`t he? -What did you think of the script? The script? The movie that it`s based on was a stupid little potboiler... -He`s asking about the script. -But the rewrite is good. Thanks to Ellie. She did all the work. lt`s good. l think this could make a kind of tough, NY, big city movie. You can`t make any money just in big cities. Well, l mean, where do you think this is going to play? lt`s not going to appeal to farmers or shopping malls in Biloxi. l completely disagree. l think if this picture... is mounted properly, it`s gonna have universal appeal. Where do you think the demographics are? The demographics? You mean why the country got so stupid suddenly? My theory is fast foods. The age group of this film. Where do you see it? The age? This will appeal to, you know, to... adults and... teenagers, young adults and... you know, kids, adolescents, l think... Toddlers, l imagine. Newborns. 0ur marketing research shows this film has wide appeal for both sexes. Yes, l agree and then some, actually. But... ...the script has some holes in it. -Like what? Well, take the climax, for instance. l think the climax comes... Comes too early, is the problem. lt should come after the trial scene. Didn`t l say that? The inciting event should come later. The character of Benny. l feel we should shoot Benny... with a handheld camera and not a Steadicam. But it should be nervous, put the audience ill at ease... ...like his inner personality. -l don`t know if l like that. lt could be with a Steadicam. You even said that. How you`d feel about this, and be honest, if we shot the whole picture... ...in black and white? -Why? Because NYC is a black-and-white town. lt reeks of black and white. -Forget it. -Arty. lt`s arty. -Does anybody have an aspirin? -Try this. l got it from my herbalist. l can do this picture. l know, l got a feel for it. l can see it all. Maybe with like a Cole Porter score? Alright, well. Let us discuss it. We`re talking to a couple of other directors and... we`ll let you know. Maybe lrving Berlin, or something. You bridge the... Well, l think we`d have to discuss it.. You know, if there ever was a Val Waxman property, this is it, right? -We`ll keep in touch. -Does anyone have a Xanax? -Zantac? l`ve got an ulcer, too. -Not Zantac, Xanax. -lt`s a completely different problem. -Can l talk to you for a second? Listen, Val... 0h, sorry. lt was great seeing you again. lt was. -You`ve got an herbalist? -0h, yes. A genius. ln Beverly Hills he`s a genius, in NYC, he`d be considered low-normal. We use a completely different rating system here. When we were kids, there were like ten foreign films a week in this city... -ltalian, French... -0h, ltalian films, l love them! Val Waxman, any messages? You`re sure? Did you see my cat? lsn`t that neat? -Sorry about that. -Anything? We were just talking about Alfred Hitchcock. Truffaut said... ...``Notorious`` was his best film. -l agree. A masterpiece. What are you talking about? The ending makes you crazy. Yes, because it`s a masterpiece. Every time l watch that movie... when Cary Grant is carrying lngrid Bergman down the staircase... l always think that the Germans are going to catch them. No matter how many times l see it, l think the Germans are gonna get them. -He was an artist, but was commercial. -You say that like it`s a good thing. You have to be both. l mean, he knew what he was doing. ln order to make movies, you have to think about the audience. 0therwise, you`re making movies for yourself, like artistic masturbation. -That`s right, you`re a narcissist. -l`m a classic narcissist then. Have l told you my views on masturbation, ever? The nicest thing about masturbation is afterward, the cuddling time. They`re laughing. l`m not joking. Want a wienie? You got it. You`re directing ``The City That Never Sleeps``. l just got the call. l can`t believe it. l can`t speak. l got half a million, plus a tenth of a point after quadruple break-even. Listen, they`re going back tonight, could you meet Ellie for a drink? -Why? -Because you owe her some thanks. She went out on a limb for you. To be sure you`re both on the same page. Think about Hal Yeager. He`s quick to hire, quick to fire. You need Ellie to run interference. Alright, alright. l`ll meet her... at the Bemelmans Bar at 9:00. l can spare ten minutes. l can`t tell ya, my head`s swimming. A tenth of a point, after quadruple break-even! You are really a shark, Al. -Congratulations. -Thank you. Can l get a Beck`s, please? We`re working together, l thought we should talk for a few minutes. That`s fine with me. l mean, as you know, Hal was a little skeptical at first. But in the end... he`s a businessman and very professional. Let me set your mind at ease. You don`t have to worry about everything. Things are gonna go very smoothly, this is... a big shot for me and l realize that... many people think that l`m... That l can be difficult. But you know l can be professional, and obviously, Hal`s professional... you`re too. As long as business is business, there should be no... l cannot understand how you could leave me for that cheesy windbag! lt`s mind-numbing to me. l just don`t understand that. And you were carrying on with him, behind my back for two months. -lt was not two months. -Yes, it was. Don`t tell me it wasn`t. You were carrying on behind my back. Not even my back, but under my nose. That`s twice a day. Both places. -0kay, you`re exaggerating. -l`m not exaggerating. You were always on the phone with him. Exchanging glances. l noticed it. Then, you were exchanging fluids. l can`t believe l didn`t see it. You were too self-absorbed, too intent on becoming the great film artist. Don`t tell me that. Everything was fine until l started to lose my audience. Suddenly you dump me and move out to Beverly Hills with a swimming pool. You hated California. We both hated it. You hated traveling... every place by car all the time. And l hated traveling by mudslide. What did you want me to do? 0ur marriage wasn`t going anyplace. Where did you want it to go? Where do marriages go? After a while they all lay there, that`s the thing about marriages. -Look... -That`s ridiculous. No, it was in trouble for a long time. You don`t see what you don`t want to. -How was it in trouble? -We didn`t communicate. -We had sex. -Yes. We had sex, but we never talked. Sex is better than talk. Ask anybody in this bar. Talk is what you suffer through so you can get to sex. You isolate everything. You can`t just compartmentalize like that. A good marriage consists of many parts well integrated. -And is one of those parts adultery? -Never! Absolutely. At the Plaza Hotel. For God`s sakes, l got the bill! You had escargot that afternoon. l can`t, it`s so disgusting! Sex and snails with that roast beef from Beverly Hills. You were so busy playing the American artist. That`s what you were doing, playing. You felt it was important to be uncompromising and temperamental... and difficult. God, difficult! To starve and to suffer. l tell you, you had all the symptoms, but not the disease. -You thought l was creative, original. -And l still do. As a filmmaker. lt`s when you became creative as a hypochondriac, that was it. -Hey, all those attacks were for real. -0h, yeah? The black plague, Val? An allergy to oxygen? Elm blight? 0nly trees get Elm blight. Elm trees. Can l sum it up? You cheated on me, you lied to me, you dumped me... -We`re here to discuss business. -That`s right. -Can we discuss it? -l wanna keep this professional. Absolutely. l think that we should rework the script a little bit... because l think it doesn`t have to be middle-aged people. We could make... the character of Kelly Swain, maybe coming out of college. -You meant out of law school? -Law school, yeah. l think they`d like that. That way we could cast somebody like Terry Tyler... or maybe find... there`s a lot of talented kids out there. You are such a shallow jerk! l can`t get my mind around it. That you would leave me for a guy who`s the opposite of everything l am. You know, with his ski lodge in Aspen... and his collection of vintage cars. lf l drove around in a 1 939 Mercedes, people would think l was Himmler. Hal`s very smart, and he`s a brilliant dealmaker. -l know. He was audited by the best. -He has made successful films. That should tell you all you need to know. He`s the white line in the road. You had your little flirtations too. There was that ltalian model. No. You were the only one that l was serious with. My God! Until you became noncommunicative, nonresponsive and dumped me. The movie is going to be fun to do. l have a lot of ideas we should discuss. l just wanted to assure you that once the studio agreed to you... ...you`ll have their full support. -Thank you very much. l want a... l think l want a foreign cameraman. -That`s no problem. -They get a texture into the work... that you`d never get with an American cameraman. They have mobility. l remember coming home and l picked-up the extension... and there you are on the other end of the extension with this guy! l`m calling and l hear my wife in a lovey-dovey... with her lover, saying that she misses her lover. -He wasn`t my lover yet. -Bull! He was your lover. And l recognize the voice. lt`s Hal Yeager from Galaxie Pictures. And l`m thinking to myself: ``Why is my wife talking like that to Hal for?`` -l thought they`d make a surprise party! -Were they? No, she was having an affair with Hal Yeager, follow the story. -Jesus, l can`t believe this. -l`m getting out of here. Wait a minute, where are you going? We`re discussing a movie. No. l`m sorry, l just... l`ll be back and forth from LA, and l won`t bother you. l`ll see to it that nobody gets in your way, creatively. What about Denise Daniels for the blackmailer? -Possibly. lf you like. -l think she would be great. 0r Sarah Bedloe, she would be very interesting. l pick up the phone and she`s talking... l`m going to order a corned beef sandwich, she`s talking to her lover. -l`ll be back from LA in two weeks. -This is gonna be a fun picture. -We`re all very excited. -l`m looking forward to it. About Hal Yeager, the word on him is cross-dresser. Check it out for me. -Yeah, later. -l pick the phone up and she... -Hal, we`re off to a good start. -Tell me about it, honey. Val wants to use a foreign cameraman, which l think we should give him. He`s got a real visual concept of where he wants to go with this thing. Now, he`s chosen Kow Chan, a Chinese cameraman... done some really stunning work, mostly with the Red Army. He says he doesn`t like his hotel. He much prefer the Sherry. Hal, listen. Val wants to go with Elio Sebastian as art director. Val says that Elio really knows the streets of New York. Every location in the script is out there waiting to be found. -This is great. lt saves us a fortune. -With the exception of two: Times Square and Harlem. l have to build them. We can`t build Times Square and Harlem, with all due respect. He wants to build the Empire State building? No! -Just the first 20 stories. -Absolutely not. No, sweetheart. -lt`s not gonna happen. Tell him no. -Alright, l`ll handle it. Good, great. Hey, listen. l miss you. How`s the weather back there? lt`s been great, it`s been really New York moody. Very gray and cloudy. -That`s the way it is. -Today`s the 1 st day of sun in a while. Well, listen. Here it`s been fabulous. Sunny and clear everyday. l gotta run, l`m having another skin cancer removed. -This is perfect. This view is perfect. -No, no. l hate it. -We`re just gonna have to build it. -Build Central Park? l take back what l said before about mixing real locations and sets. l don`t wanna be a money watchdog, but if you did build everything... it would have to be done over my dead body, metaphorically. Alright, if not the whole park, then just the reservoir. -Build the reservoir? -You know what? You get a studio... put a tank in it and fill it with a couple thousand gallons of water. And then, wait, trees behind it. NY as a symphony in green. Green l hate, l never use green. No, no green. You know what? Tell Mother Nature, okay. Trees are green. We can play it for the winter. You can use snow. -Manufactured snow? -l buy that. A white background... to set off the two leads and marvelous `40s red. What? What? What is he saying? What? He says no white, no white. He cannot shoot white background. -What have you gotten me into here? -You know what? l prefer green. All l`m saying is that l think you`re being precipitous in firing him. -Look, l never wanted this guy. -Hal! May l offer for your consideration, a single concept, and l say this... Val, you don`t have to lean into the speaker. He`s out. l want this guy out before this movie becomes a cost nightmare. -l think, if we had a talk with him... -l said from the start to use Pappas! Pappas is a hack. Pappas is safe, but he`s uninspired... ...l can`t work with him. -Then you should bow out now. l said l can`t work with him, l didn`t say l wouldn`t. Val, l don`t mean to get hot under the collar, but Pappas has how many... nominations compared to this Greenwich Village lunatic? They probably spent more money getting those nominations... than he`ll spend building a reservoir. -l didn`t get that. -That`s nothing, Hal. l gave in on the Chinese cameraman, l`ve kept away from your picture. l`m just saying l`d feel more secure with Pappas. A word to the wise. ls there anything about the part that you want to tell me, before l read it? 0nly that he`s a Broadway sharpie, a gambler. -Like Sky Masterson? -Perfect. Exactly. Forgive me, it might seem obvious, but he`s a Runyonesque... bookmaker-type, is tough... but softhearted with his wife, who he`s nuts about? That`s it on the nose. That would be perfect. Go. Some guys were over the house for you. Seems you owe some money. l hope you didn`t tell them anything, Helen. l could find myself in deep trouble! Deep, deep trouble. Thank you. Hi, okay, let me go. l`ll wait for you. lf they give you 30 years, l`ll be waiting. lf they give you 50 years, l`ll be waiting. lf you get two consecutive life sentences... l`ll be waiting. l thought that last girl was kind of interesting, did you? -Really? -She read it better than the others. l know, but Claire`s supposed to be classy. Didn`t you think she was a little on the cheap side? -Cheap? -l thought she radiated stupidity. -Stupidity? -Her reading was competent enough... but, my God, it`s like her persona, it`s trashy and dumb. l think l`d like to use her. She was interesting. You`re the director. -lt`s not that big a part, Ellie. -But it`s a featured role. Claire`s supposed to be a socialite, for God`s sake. This girl, Lori Fox, she`s a step above trailer park. -l wouldn`t call her trailer park! -l said ``a step above``. Well, l`d like to use her. l thought she was perfect for the role. Fine. l mean, it`s your decision. l`m just throwing out ideas here. -Two for Yeager, please. -They`re clearing your table. -Thank you. -l`m so glad that you could come in. l was here on business and l wanted an excuse to see you. -Don`t think l was crowding you. -l know you, you`re checking up on me. -Everything`s going really fine. -And Val? Val`s Val. He seems reasonably flexible. Most of his ideas are good. -l hope so. -You`ll see. -Right this way. -Thank you. There are no personal feelings that make it seem awkward? No, l think he`s accepted things and moved on. Good, Andrea Ford will be covering the making of the film, for ``Esquire``. No kidding? Val! We were just talking about you. Ellie was telling me how well things are going. -Good to see you, everything alright? -What are you doing here? What do you mean, ``What am l doing``? lt`s funny, we used to eat here. -Hal came in on a plane hours ago. -That`s the best way to fly. What are you doing in this restaurant at this moment? We`re coming in to get a bite to eat. Are you alright? You`re awfully fidgety or something. -What are you doing? Are you okay? -Yes, no, l`m fine. -l think you should go to your table. -l`m ready to go. lt`s the woman that was at the audition today. That`s very funny! -Aren`t you going to introduce me? -lt`s Lori Fox, isn`t it? -Yes, l think it was. -Yes. Val is such a riot. Stop kidding around. l wanted to put your mind at ease... Just because l`m the director`s significant other, l can still act. Hal! Hey, Mort, how are you? l thought you were in Aspen. -l wish. -You know Ellie, my fianc?e? Fianc?e? -Congratulations, when`s the date? -New Year`s Eve. My goodness, how romantic. That`s wonderful. -Congratulations on your new film. -You know Val Waxman. -0f course, sure... -Fianc?e? We sued him for failure to complete a picture. -That makes me feel secure. -l`ll see you tomorrow, Val. Hurry! l`ll miss my flight. This is not a good time for you to go away. l`m very vulnerable. lf l`m gonna be in this movie, l have to get into shape. This spa is the only way l`ll ever have the discipline. -But you`re not overweight. -0h, my God! l`m a horse! -l have to appear in lingerie. -What if we need you? l saw the shotting schedule. My scene doesn`t come until the very end. What if l need you? l`m going through a bad time. You`ll be fine. You`ll be fine. You`re a big boy. 0h, jeez. You know, l`m afraid to sleep alone... l keep thinking people are breaking in. l lay awake all night... thinking of death and the blackness of the abyss. Don`t forget to water my cactus. Call me everyday. l can`t. They don`t have any phones at the Dolby Ranch. They want to discourage secret eating schemes. 0h, my gosh! 0h, my gosh. l gotta go, gotta go! And we want to see the earrings, profile. 0ther profile, please. And cut. Thank you. ls it true your cameraman speaks only Chinese? Yes, Mandarin. lt`s so hard to find a good Cantonese cameraman these days. Neighborhoods just don`t have them anymore. Hal Yeager`s know to be very hands-on, very hot-tempered. Quick to replace people. Does that bother you? No, because the deal is that they`re going to... leave me alone during the shooting. l have complete freedom. How about working so closely with your ex-wife? She`ll just be up and back. lt`s not going to be that close. Well, there must be some bitterness, especially now that... she`s going to marry Hal Yeager... the man she left you for who`s now your boss? -Who are you? -l`m Andrea Ford. l`m going to be doing the story on the making of the movie for ``Esquire``. 0h, really, are you? Didn`t they tell you? l`m going to be observing the whole time. `Cause l don`t usually like, you know... when journalists hang around the set and observe when l work. Take that up with the press department, but don`t worry... l won`t get in your way, l promise. l am a huge fan. -Yes? -l have loved all of your movies. 0h, well, you know... and you`ll be hanging around, doing a story here? Yes, because in fact, l`ve always thought of you as... kind of an unique American artist, really. l`m sure you won`t be in the way here, there`s plenty of room... Val? l`m so sorry, can l steal him for a minute? -l really was about to... -Some things we have to go over. l`ll get him right back to you in one minute. l`m so sorry. -Be careful, she`s a killer. -She`s a killer? l didn`t think it was a good idea having her around all the time... but then the press department told Hal that they could get the cover... How is she a killer? She loves me. Well, that`s fine. lf she likes you. 0therwise, she can be biting. -Really? -She`s all sugar and sweetness... and gets into your good graces, and then wham! She kept telling Sean Madigan how she loved his films, and was a big fan. And how he was a great unique American artist. And then in the profile she did, she disemboweled him. lf you happen to fall for that kind of flattery... l can handle it, though. Please. You couldn`t handle Shirley Temple. Give me a break, will ya? l can`t figure it out. lt`s okay to have an affair with Hal Yeager, but... Everyone is entitled to one psychotic episode in their lives... but to marry the guy is crazy. -l wouldn`t talk if l were you. -What does that mean? l don`t know. How long have you been living with that wind-up doll l met? You know l don`t like to sleep alone. For God`s sake, l`m not marrying her. And that wind-up doll happens to have a Ph.D. ln what? History of Gym? Hey, look. Will you give me a break with the cutting remarks? l got a picture to do Tuesday. - l`m thinking about my work. -Get some rest this weekend, okay? And don`t lie around worrying about everything that could go wrong. Don`t worry. l`m not going to lie around. l`ve got my hand on the wheel, honey. This picture`s in the bank. -Amanda, honey, who is it? -l don`t know. Uncle Al, it`s for you. -Al! -l`m sorry. -A man or woman? -l think it`s a man. Al, you gotta get over here right away! Why? What`s wrong? l`m at my sister`s for a Seder. Al, you gotta get over here. This is a matter of life and death! lt`s open, come in! What is it? What`s going on? What l`m doing here? Al, l`m going to try to explain this to you. l came home, and l started to make notes on the script, you know. Because we shoot Tuesday and l wanted, you know... Then l started to get nervous. So, l sat down on the sofa... and l was doing my deep-breathing exercises... just to stay calm, you know. And it was working, and l started to relax, and l dozed off. Then l slept for a while. Then l woke-up, Al... ...and l can`t see anything. -What? -l`m blind. l`m blind, Al. -What? l`m blind. l`m blind! l can`t see. -What do you mean, you can`t see? -What do you mean what do l mean? Those guys in the street with the dark glasses and the accordions? -What are you saying? Are you trying? -You can`t try and see. You look around and you see or you don`t see! l don`t see. -How can you be blind? -How the hell do l know? -Al, l`m scared. -What did you eat? What`s the difference what l ate? You can`t lose your vision from a plate of tofu. -l never heard of anything like this. -Yes... l did. Remember the actor Harvey Gates? He lost his vision suddenly. -From what? -Grapefruit. -Grapefruit? -Yes... he had a tumor the size of a grapefruit on his brain. -And he went blind? -Yes, he went blind... and a few months later he went dead. Which is worse than blind, `cause your options decrease. Relax, you don`t have a brain tumor. Al, with all due respect... l have to hear that from somebody who went to a greater medical school... than the William Morris Agency. We`ll get you to Dr. Mason. You still use Mason, right? No, Mason dropped dead on the treadmill. l use Koch. l use Koch too. Did you bump into anything? Did you bump your head? l didn`t bump my head. Nothing! Al, l got a brain tumor. That`s the story. -The end is in sight. l see the wall! -l thought you said you couldn`t see. lt`s an expression. l don`t actually mean l see a wall. lt`s in my mind`s eye. l remember that Ellie and l took you to the hospital, you insisted on that... because you were convinced you had hoof-and-mouth disease. 0h, God. Ellie! lf l die, Al, tell Ellie l`m sorry l said all those things to her. l said terrible things to her. l called her all kinds of names! Probably because l never stopped loving her. -You`re not dying. -lf l don`t die... tell her she`s a tramp and she`s living with a guy... the best you can say about him is sometimes he returns phone calls! Dr. Koch? lt`s Al Hack here. Sorry to call you at home on holiday, but l`m here with Val Waxman... -You can sit back now. -So, what`s the story? Well, your optic nerve is normal. Your eye exam is normal. l don`t see anything. You don`t see anything? l don`t see anything either, that`s the problem. A tumor large enough to impact on his vision so dramatically would show up. l only wish l was in as good health as he is. This is a textbook scenario. Physically, you`re a hundred percent. But just like someone who has an hysterical paralysis... a patient who`s fine but he can`t walk or... a patient who loses his or her voice... from witnessing a horrible shock, or any extreme stress-related trauma. Being a film director, your inner conflicts... have chosen to express themselves in this very telling fashion. You`re psychosomatically blind. -How can l get rid of it? -By treatment. By understanding the roots of your conflict, there`s every chance... ...this blindness will go away. -How quickly? Well, real growth is always very slow. -There goes my comeback. -You can`t breathe a word to anybody. l gotta tell`em, Al. You know, l just dread telling Ellie. Are you nuts? They`ll fire you! Fire me? l obviously can`t direct the picture. What are you talking about? How can you blow this shot? -What are you talking about? l`m blind! -Nobody knows. What the hell does that mean? What are you suggesting? lf you pull out of this project now because psychological stress... has caused you to lose your sight, you`ll never work again. -Maybe they could postpone it. -0h, yeah, because you`re blind? Val, direct this picture and bring in a hit, or l leave you with two words: -Homeless man. -l can`t direct. How can l... You`re going to muddle your way through, until your sight returns. Al, l can`t direct a picture, l`m blind! Have you seen some of the pictures out there? -The first 5 minutes they`ll catch me. -Maybe they will, maybe they won`t. lf they do, you`re no worse off than if you confess. You`re finished anyway. Al, you gotta be joking. l`ll take one step on the set, l`ll break my neck. -No, l`ll come with you. -They won`t let you. The actors get nervous when agents hang around. lt`s against the policy. 0nce you get on the set, you get relaxed, you won`t even need me. There`s no way to do this. l`d have to take somebody into my confidence. Absolutely not. No, never. Not a hint, this can`t get out. You will direct a hit picture. Sometimes God works in strange ways. Like Job. Notes on ``Making of `The City That Never Sleeps`: First morning atmosphere is upbeat. Lots of eager anticipation. People moving lights. Actors and actresses already in costume and makeup. Val Waxman is not the first one on the set. Actually, a few minutes late.`` -This is never going to work. -lt`s working perfect. Stand straight. -Am l going to bump into anything? -l`ll guide you. You have to trust me. l gotta look funny. You look perfect, l`m telling you. Look at this, how wonderful, nice. -Morning, would you like anything? -Coffee. Want some coffee? Yeah... No, thank you. Well, the actors are here if you`re ready to block the scene. -Block the scene? -Yes. We could... -Are you okay with the set changes? -0h, the set. -lt`s beautiful! -lt`s great. -How about the background? Satisfied? -lt`s blue and brown and yellow... ...is it a little dark? -Beg your pardon, who are you? -l`m Al Hack. l`m his agent. -Al, can l speak to you a second? l`ll be right back, don`t worry. l`ll be right back. Al. Not that you`re not welcome here. You know l love you. -But this is a closed set. -He really needs me. -He likes me to be with him. -l know, but... a man of your stature, an agent, it intimidates people. -You look good. Had any work done? -Just over here. A little? `Cause l... Who did you go to? Not that l need it... ...but l`m thinking about it. -Fred. He`s incredible. You got the best clients. Can you get me a price? l think that we may be like a little too light. Would you prefer it darker? Well, that`s a possibility. What do you think? What would you do? l really don`t know. l could make the whole thing match the upholstery. That`s brilliant. That`s what l would do. l would match the upholstery. Excuse me, Chief. What alarm clock would you like to go with? That one. -Which one? -That one. -l`m sorry, which? -Yes, yes. That one. You like the wind-up or the electric? -Yes, the wind-up. The wind-up. -Val? Excuse me, gentlemen. -Why is it so difficult? -Can l see you for a second? -Excuse me. -Al, this is not working. Don`t worry. lt`s going to work fine. lt`s a closed set and l have to leave. -Listen to me. Just go to plan B. -What is plan B? We gotta find somebody who you trust. Who will help you. -Someone you can rely on. -You mean, tell someone the truth? Yes. Somebody who`s naturally around you all the time... who doesn`t look odd. Maybe the A.D.? -What about the script girl? -l can`t do that. They`ll get in trouble. lf they get caught, they`ll never work in the business again. l have a responsibility, Al, to Ellie and even to Hal. You have a responsibility to yourself! You have agent`s ethics, l can`t go by you. Don`t hit me with oxymorons at this time. We`re in a crisis! -Wait. What about the Chinese kid? -The translator? Yes, the translator. He`s a business student at NYU, right? He doesn`t care if he`s in the movie business. lt`s no big penalty. -He`s always around me. -Yes. -lt`s natural. -Perfect. Val, l`ve got the actors. We`re ready for you. Don`t worry. l`ll get you to the set. Take it easy. l`ll take you. lt`s gonna be fine. -l`m acting so crazy, they`ll notice. -You got a reputation for being crazy. This is the perfect time for it to work in your favor. Watch out, one step. Very good. Hey, can l have Mr. Waxman`s chair here? The director needs his chair. Where is it? Thank you, very much. Here, come sit. Look, your lucky chair. lsn`t that wonderful? Sit, be relaxed. Real good. Good luck. -l can`t work with people watching me. -Nobody`s gonna be watching. lncidentally, you like this one, or this one? -l like that. -This one? This one`s more like what they really use, but this one`s more theatrical. You know, you can use this one if you`d like, but l prefer that one. -The first or the second? -l`d like my entrance from the stairs. He says he doesn`t like the costume, it`s too light. -Who ordered? What`s happening? -How do you want me to kiss her? -What`s happening here? -Which way you want me to kiss her? What? -You know, on the mouth. -What about my mouth? No. Kiss her on the mouth. He hasn`t seen her for six years. We discussed a kind of passionate way. 0h, well. Use both lips. Excuse me. Could l talk to you just for a second? -Me? -Yeah, just for a minute. -They need me. -Well, actually... the director asked me to talk to you. -Mr. Waxman? -A chance to make some extra salary. You seem to be a very responsible young man. Are you? -You should move left. -You got me doing two things at once. l can`t work if l don`t know what you want me to do. You should cross left. Me? You mean my left? lf l cross my left, l`m going to bump into him. -You don`t have to bump into me. -l`m going to knock him over. Where`s the translator? He`s supposed to be on set! Sir, l have a very important message for you. -lmportant message for me? -l`m here to help you. l know about your secret. Don`t! Cut! Very good. That was terrific. Was it very good? Was it very good? Well, l don`t see the dramatic impact of it. lt seemed a little improvement from the random chaos you were encouraging. Thank you. You didn`t like the random chaos. Can we go again? Just for safety, one more? We`re approaching a hallway right now. So we`re gonna walk slowly. There`s nobody here. Practically nobody. Careful. -lt`s difficult to be casual. -l know. Sorry. Boss, you alright? l`m fine. lt was my fault completely. l forgive you. Sir, he`s gone. He`s not there anymore. You`re talking to air. -Why didn`t you warn me? -l thought you saw him. -This is very weird for me. -You thought l saw him? How am l... -A few summers ago... -You`re going too fast. l was helping out a deaf uncle a few summers ago. -But we didn`t have to hide like this. -Jesus, this is great. Val, you wanna go with this one tomorrow, or the big one? -These are beautiful pocket watches! -Thanks. -l would go with the big one. -Perfect. -How did you feel the first day went? -The first day? lt was like, you know. Like the first day. lt was like a shakedown where you weed out the malcontents. l`d love to speak with you for a few minutes, if you`re not too busy and all. -l, l... -You said you wanted to show me... ...that piece of jade? -Jade? -Know what? lf you have work to do... -Yes, l do. Thank you. Sorry, sir. That`s all l could think of to extricate you. -You realize there`s no piece of jade? -Yes, l get it. There`s no jade. -Everything okay? -So far our conspiracy... ...has gone undetected. -l`m taking you to your shrink now. -Listen. Same drill tomorrow. -l`ll practice casual banter. Very good. Nice to see you. To observe Val Waxman directing... one would think he has no idea what he`s doing. l wonder if he is one of those cinema geniuses... who thrive on chaos, like Fellini. He always seems distracted, he never looks anyone in the eye... and must be juggling a million things in his mind at once. lt`s easy to see why his reputation is one of an eccentric. l notice, too, as the weeks go by... what a great interest he has in the photography... as he is always conferring with the cameraman, through his translator. -How were they? The dailies? -You forget l`m not a film student... hence, a poor judge. l study business... and as an investment, sir, l wouldn`t invest... He says he cannot understand what it is you`re trying to do, sir. -He thinks it`s very odd. -How were the performances? l wouldn`t know, sir. But you could hear them, right? 0r is your hearing faculty breaking down as well? My hearing is fine. But are they making too many faces? What about the scenes where there`s no dialogue? How`s the action? l understand the actions, but that`s because l`ve read the script. But, sir, l must confess... Be careful. The steps. There is a strong sense of incoherence. -lncoherence? -lncoherence. That`s great. That`s exactly what l`m going for, is incoherence. -How were they? -l`m happy. They were great. Which take was best of the robbery scene? -The last one. -The first one. The first part of the last one... is better than the last part of the first one. But the middle take`s probably the most overall. l smell magic here. -How`s it going? -lt seems to be going alright. He spends a lot of time conferring with his cameraman through the translator... and that takes time, but l got my foot on the pedal. Pedal to the metal. -Put him on, will you? -Yeah, l`ll find him. Carol? Send some flowers to Haley Joel 0sment with a card... ``Congratulations on your Lifetime Achievement Award``. lt`s Ellie. She wants to talk to you. Hello? Hi, l hear it`s going pretty well. 0h, yes. As far as l can see. Good. Listen, l`m gonna come in next week. Take a look at some dailies. l wouldn`t do that. l`ve stayed away for the first half of the film, Val. l sort of... Nobody sees my dailies except myself and the cameraman. That`s our deal. You used to always ask my opinion on the dailies. Those days are over, honey. That was when you were a sharp New Yorker. You know, anyone with an herbalist doesn`t see my dailies. As filming reaches the halfway mark... rumor has it that Sharon Bates, the leading lady... has developed a crush on Val Waxman. He seems to resist personal contact with anyone... but today she insisted he visit her dressing room. Excuse me, l`ll see you later. We`ll discuss it, okay? -Yes, don`t go far. -0kay, l`ll be right here. l understand that you wanted to talk about something with me. Can l be frank? Yes, of course. l`m having a real problem working with you. Problem working with me? Why? Well, l feel something unspoken... has developed between us. Something developed between us? Like, like what? Well. lt might be my imagination, but... the way you look at me, it`s like... it`s like you`re making love to me with your eyes... My eyes? Look, l`m a very direct person. When l start having feelings... about someone, l don`t hold back. You know, l thought we were gonna discuss the character... l thought you were having trouble getting into the role, or something. Am l making you nervous? No, you know. l`ve had a tough day out there. A lot of tough decisions. l`m a little frazzled maybe, but l`m fine. -Come here. -Just, you know... Come here. Why don`t you sit on the sofa with me? -The sofa? -Just for a minute. -The sofa, the sofa. Yes, okay. -l just want your full attention. The sofa`s fine. So, so... l don`t need a throw pillow, l`m comfortable. lf l trust a director to direct me... l trust him to make love to me. 0h, well, just let me say this. l`m a big believer in that, but... Not while l`m working, because... l never like to mix business with pleasure, because... l`m a dedicated artist and like a Trappist monk, l feel the best way... to do a good picture is to abstain till the shooting is over, because... it`s my adoration of the cinema. Cinema is a jealous mistress... and so l`m... l, you know, l`m... That`s just the way l am. But we can table our... We can wait till after the shooting`s over... -What are you doing? -Me? When l feel emotionally moved in some way... some people smoke. l fondle walls. -lt`s just a crazy. -l`m sorry. l didn`t mean to upset you. -No, l`m not upset, l understand. -lf l act with a fine director... like yourself... there`s nothing l wouldn`t do sexually for him. Well, you should take a full-page ad in the DGA magazine stating that... because you`ll never stop working then. ls it possible to open the door for me? All the heavy breathing has steamed my glasses and l`m... Am l close? So we`ll talk again like this. Thank you. -Al? Al? -Here, here. l`m here! This time it`s different. What do you mean? This time it`s my father. Johnny! Your father! You can`t kill your father! They want him dead! What am l supposed to do? You get a hold of yourself. He`s got it coming like anyone else. This is great. This is great! That`s exactly where it should be. No. lf you put the camera there, it`s the wrong direction. The audience will think she`s looking at the wall, not her lover. l know screen geography. Chan, am l right? ls that where it should be? He never understands what the hell you`re trying to do, sir. Believe me, l know. But leave the camera where it is. -He`s a genius. -Yes. His style. the way he shoots, it`s so... unconventional. Really? -Was he difficult to live with? -Sometimes. As the second missus, did you consider yourself a young trophy wife? Andrea, l thought this wasn`t a gossip piece. No, l`m just curious how you two met. At the Golden Globes. l was there with a date... and l thought it was interesting that when he won he thanked his urologist. -Next time, warn me before l fall. -But the journalist was around. -Are you okay? That was something. -lt`s nothing. Just a fractured skull. -Listen, you wanna go grab a bite? -l can`t, Al`s meeting me. -l got a very important meeting. -l told you to set aside some time... so that we could discuss things. lt`s not easy for me. l got a lot of meetings and important things to do. -How about a drink later then? -l can`t, maybe after the shooting. l don`t know, it`s tough for me. Could l just get a moment with him alone? Thanks very much. You`ve been avoiding me since l got in. Why? How am l avoiding you? l let you see the dailies. You saw some of them. -You made no comment whatsoever. -Well. l mean, l`m not a director. Personally l had some difficulty making sense out of `em. But l assume that once they`re all cut together... You know what you want. -They`ll just be great. l like them. -So then why are you avoiding me? l`m not avoiding you, for God`s sakes. l`m busy. l got a lot on my mind. -ls it about the ring? -The ring? -The ring? -Don`t pretend that you don`t see it. -l know how you are on the subject. -No. Hey, your ring is beautiful. l love the shape of it, and l think it`s probably expensive, knowing Hal. -l`m not wearing it. -l know you`re not wear... l knew! Because l thought it might be what`s accounting for your strange behavior. My behavior`s fine. Everybody`s commenting on my behavior. Remember when we got married and we didn`t have time to get a ring... and l had to go in and get that thing in the novelty shop? l got that ring that squirted water as a practical joke. l didn`t know that our marriage would turn out to be God`s practical joke. -You stayed in it long enough. -lnertia accounts for two-thirds... ...of the marriages in America. -Yeah, but the other third is love. We should just talk about the last couple of weeks and post-production... l got nothing to talk about. l`m waiting for Al. He`s always late! -He`s invariably late. -Lunch. Lunch. -He`s here! Al`s here. -He`s so funny. He`s so tense. l kid him about being late. He`s great, l love him. -What`s his problem? -He`s firing me! -He`s firing you? Why? -He cannot work with me anymore. -He wants to find somebody else. -l don`t get it, what`s the problem? He thinks that something must be getting lost in his translation... and that his work is coming out irrationally. -Tell him that l love the dailies! -To be honest, they`re not very lucid. Just tell him what l tell you to tell him! He wants me off the set. 0therwise, he won`t work. With all due respect to Mr. Chan, we`re on the clock here. lt costs the studio approximately US$ 1 50 thousand a day to shoot. Explain that to him, nicely. Wait. l got a great idea! Why don`t we fire the cameraman, but keep the translator? Now, wait, wait. Hold on a second, Val. -Ed`s right. That`s how it`s gonna be. -l can`t fire the translator! -Why not? -Because l can`t! -Ching. -lt`s Chou. -Who are we gonna get to replace you? -You have no idea... who the new translator will be, or even how long before they find one. 0n the way over, l was thinking about... What about the caterer? He has no reason to be on the set all the time. You wanted someone... who wouldn`t be ruined in the business when they`re caught. -lf. l said ``if``. -There really is no one. l was perfect. Ellie is gonna be around here till the end of the... And she does suspect something, l... Wait a minute. l just need you for a private minute. Al, listen. lf this is about being on the set, even if Galaxie... made an exception, these actors, they`re not gonna allow it, so... -Come here. Sit down. -Why? -Well, l need your help. -0kay. What can l do for you? You know this is the end of the line for Val if he doesn`t have a hit here. He will. He can do this material with his eyes closed. Yeah. Right... But... if for any reason he strikes out here... his last hopes for a career, they`re over. Listen, Al. l wanna put your mind at ease. While l`ve seen the dailies... and they`re not what l expected, l`m sure he has a vision. Don`t worry about it. Look. lf a problem came up, a little problem... where he needed a little support... a little behind-the-scenes support just for the last several weeks... l`m starting to get that Val Waxman chill. What`s going on? Could l level with you? No, l mean, really level. Pull no punches. -What is it, Al? -lt`s nothing that can`t be dealt with. He`s just... He`s blind. You wanna be serious? We`re already behind schedule. This`s been crazy... the cameraman threw his little fit and l`m losing my sense of humor... ...because things are going crazy. -He`s blind. He can`t see at all. But don`t panic. lt`s not a tumor. lt`s not a disease of the optic nerve. -lt`s not permanent. lt`s... -What is it? -lt`s a psychological disorder. -0h, God! lt`s psychosomatic. People get paralyzed because of trauma. This is not happening, Al. He is on the set right now faking it, but he`s gonna need someone... to help him get through the rest of the picture. The rest of the picture? What are you talking about? How long has this been going on? Since day one. You know the Chinese translator? He`s been the secret agent up till now. But now he`s gone, and we`re gonna need somebody that he can trust... who`ll stay close to him and won`t look suspicious. You`re telling me that he has directed everything up to this point, blind? No one has any idea. He didn`t want his career destroyed forever... by another disaster story about his work problems. No one knows. And that`s just because of the translator and because of me. And no one must find out. l mean, l`m serious, Al. Nobody. Not anybody on the crew, not the drivers, the actors... not anyone from Galaxie Pictures! l knew you`d understand this problem. God, may the day June 1 9th rot in hell for all eternity! -ls that the day you married Val? -No. lt`s the day he was born. Don`t get upset. Don`t get upset. Please. No wonder he`s been avoiding me, and acting so strange! -He didn`t want anybody to know! -That self-destructive... Psychosomatically blind? That hypochondriacal neurotic! -l say that with all due respect. -You campaigned for him to get the job. -No one must know. -l understand that. But what you have to do is be his eyes for these last couple of weeks. ``...mellowed, you`ve grown up, no more impossible neurotic symptoms.`` -l should have had my head examined. -Ellie, l thought l had a brain tumor! -For God`s sakes, be sympathetic! -You couldn`t get a tumor if you tried. -You`re not mature enough. -lf the picture fails... ...l go down the drain! -lf Hal ever finds out... Hal won`t find out. We`re in the homestretch. Well, what exactly is making you go blind? l mean, when is it gonna stop? Did you talk to your analyst? What did your analyst say? Sit. -He doesn`t have a clue. -No. Down. -He just doesn`t know. -Well, that`s great! What are you gonna do? Are you gonna edit it blind too? Put in the music blind? Go to the premiere blind? At least you won`t... ...be able to read the reviews. -What if it doesn`t leave me? -What if l stay blind? -l don`t know. l`ll be in California at my swimming pool. You`ll probably... have to learn Braille, get a dog, work the subway. -Aren`t you gonna put me to bed? -Put you to bed? l can`t do it by myself. Al always puts me to bed. 0h, God. Val, is this project headed for disaster? Relax. l can handle it. Beethoven did his symphonies while he was deaf. You`re comparing yourself to Beethoven? Could we not get in a musical discussion now? How could you do this and not be thinking about anybody else? That`s the thing. After all, this is my movie! And everybody`s... ...giving their life`s blood. -Give me a break. For God`s sakes, everyone`s getting paid top dollar. You`re marrying a billionaire. 0nly l`ll go into the toilet if things fail. lt`s funny. l just don`t think that Hal`s gonna see it that way. Hal`s not gonna know, unless you tell him during pillow talk or something. You guys probably don`t have pillow talk. He probably has sex with you while he`s on the cellular phone. You know what? You`re fine. l`ll see you tomorrow. Don`t go. Ellie, for God`s sakes, you gotta put me to bed. -Al always tucks me in. -He`s your agent. There`s no limit. Ellie, come on. You used to be very maternal toward me. You were infantile. You needed it. Except in bed. Then you were a hot number. l was a small-town girl, and you were on the cutting edge of everything. How did l go from the cutting edge to the buttering edge? How did l end up in a mess like this? This is not the first time we`ve been in trouble. We`ve had some... ...pretty sticky situations. -No, not like this. l can recall them. lt wasn`t all... We`ve had our share of situations, no question about it. Like losing our car in a crap game? Absolutely. That was a disaster. l told you at the time: ``Never trust a male with a fixed nose.`` But you didn`t listen. lt was humiliating for us. Do you remember staying up all night in Paris, listening to jazz... and ending up in jail somehow? To this day l can`t figure out how you got us into jail. As l recall, it was your shoplifting. `Cause you had to have chocolate croissants... and l`d left my wallet back at the hotel. You were so demanding. lt was your command of the language. Never use the familiar with a cop. lt`s funny `cause my unfulfilled life dream... is that you and l would live in Paris together. You know. l was willing, and you were the one who always lost your nerve. lt`s funny, though. lt seems like so long ago now. lt`s amazing how things change, isn`t it? Yep, they do. And those days are over. See you tomorrow. Your agent`ll take you to the bathroom in the morning. The movie is in its last two weeks. Val Waxman`s ex-wife, who was very hands-off when shooting began... is now very much involved. l notice that Val relies a lot on her. They are in constant conference. They lunch together everyday and... l suppose, discuss the work. She is the only one besides the cameraman... and the new translator, who Val allows to see the dailies. -How were they? -Really great. Really great. Great, great. No, everything`s going fine. The dailies are really great. We seem to be pretty much on schedule, you know. Well, l must say, l had my doubts, but you proved me wrong. -Maybe he is a new man. -Great. Really. Right. By the way, l`m coming in for the last few days. l`ve got some business. l wanna make the wrap party, and l have to be honored at a dinner and... probably Val and l should have a private talk about post-production... the editing and have our picture taken together... to dispel all those rumors that we couldn`t get along. Yeah, that`s right. 0kay. Alright. Take care. Can`t wait to see you. Quick union question, Hal. Can a hyphenate marry... ...a below-the-line person? -That`s for legal. l gotta tell you my nightmare. l dreamt last night that... Hal found out everything. That he somehow just knew that l was blind... and that l had been blind from the beginning... and that l was directing the picture blind, with the translator`s help... and with your help, and l... And in the dream, l spoke to my shrink... and l asked him how long it would last, and he said indefinitely. And... Hal got furious with me, and furious with you for helping me. lt was just terrible. l was just screaming and, you know. God, it... You know. l haven`t really had a good night`s sleep... in l don`t know how long. The anxiety`s terrible. Alright. Thanks for getting me back. Al should be here any minute. -Are you sure you`re gonna be okay? -Yes. We had some close calls today. l have to tell you, l am very worried about... ...Hal finding out. -l told you my nightmare. -No, you didn`t. -Yeah. l told you before, remember? No, you didn`t. What did you dream? l told you. l went into great detail. -You didn`t tell me, what are you... -l... l... -lt smelled like you. -lt smelled like me? What are you talking about? l told you my nightmare. l told you, didn`t l? No, you didn`t. What... Did you? -l don`t know, did l? -No, you didn`t tell me. Before, when l was saying my nightmare in detail. 0h, God, Val! The journalist, Andrea Ford. We wear the same perfume. You didn`t... 0h, God! -What are you saying? l told her? -Did you? Did l? -l don`t know, did l? -lf you told her, that`s it. We`re so... That`s it. 0h, my God. -Lori. -Ellie! Val, it`s... ...Lori. -Lori? Yes, oh, l know it`s Lori. You`re home unexpectedly. You`re a week early. l got bored. But l`m almost ready to shoot my part. -l`m so excited! -Yes, but... this is just so completely unexpected. l didn`t call `cause l was so busy working out. My God, how they drive you. But look at me. Don`t l look great? Look, it`s really hard. You can hit it. Val, help me with my bags. -The bags? -Doesn`t it look good? -l`ll get that. -No! You`re not gonna let... ...your producer lug my bags for me. -lt`s fine. l forgot she existed. My God. -You can`t stay here, Lori. -What? You can`t stay here because Ellie and l have gotten back together. -What? -What? We have. We thought about it a little bit, and we felt that... ...we had made a mistake. -Val... l can`t lie to her, Ellie. You know, it`s not fair. She can`t come with the two of us. Three`s a crowd. l`m speechless. l`m sorry. The heart is very unpredictable. lt`s not like the liver or anything. -Am l still in the movie? -You are. Definitely. Definitely. -For sure. -0kay, okay. lt`s okay. l`m fine with the personal rejection. l`m really okay with it. Thank God l kept that other apartment. -Try to understand... -No, it`s fine. l totally understand. -l`m still in the movie, right? -Yeah, you`re in the movie! -You`re in the movie. -Help me with this. Take it. Val, come on! My incense burner`s in there. Be careful. We were at my apartment, and we`re in the bedroom together... and we were reminiscing. lt was great, and l wanted so much to kiss her... But l can`t see! What makes you think you could`ve kissed her? She`s engaged. Look, l gotta get this blindness... l gotta get finished with it... because this is crazy. Not just for my work, but... ...l wanna lead a normal life! -Tell me about the movie. There`s nothing to tell about the movie. lt`s a little... remake of a 1 940s movie, about a father and son who don`t get along... and the kid grows-up to be a gangster, and he gets hired to kill his father. -You have a son, don`t you? -Yes, from a prior marriage. lt`s very interesting how you never bring him up. -Well, we don`t speak. -Why not? Because he`s got, orange hair, with nose rings and nipple rings, and... lip rings... -He plays drums loud... -ls that any reason? No, but he gave a concert and he ate a live rat at the concert... and he`s got tattoos all over his body, and we had a discussion... about music and he threatened to push me down a flight of stairs. -What happened? -lt worked. He pushed me down a flight of stairs. And how were you as a father to him? l was fine. l was very nice to him. l took him to sporting events... and to the ballet and opera. And l encouraged his friends... let him play music and stood behind him. -And? -And we had a discussion one day... ...and he shoved me down the stairs. -Where`s his mother? She`s married to a millionaire in Brazil. Very nice lady. So, when you live with the plot of this movie everyday... and it parallels the situation with your son, how does that make you feel? Well, you know, l feel angry, because... l`m angry. l always thought that when he got older we would be very friendly... and he would have a family, and l`d be part of it... -You must miss him. -We never speak. Well, you`ve blinded yourself to the situation. Hey, listen. Can we not digress? l`m here to discuss my... psychological loss of vision. Meanwhile, Hal`s coming in a week... and l don`t want him to catch me. No, no, no. He`ll be staying at this suite, as usual. He`s gonna have you up for one of his man-to-man talks... which means you`ll be alone with him... ...for about half an hour. Ahead. -What if it`s more than half an hour? lt never is. His concentration`s only good for about... Sorry about that. His concentration`s only good for about half an hour. He`s a busy guy. -l`ll never get down the hallway. -Don`t worry about it. l`m gonna meet you at the door, Al will get you to the front door... and then l`ll get you through the front hall down here... to the suite. We should just... We should start. Go straight ahead. 1 , 2, 3, 4. That puts the first chair just to your right. -l`m lost. Where should l be? -You can`t be lost yet. You just hold on. lf Hal`s there, you come forward another two paces. That`ll be to the right of the first chair. No, the desk is to your left, from the first chair, four paces. -And then... -Four paces to the desk or the left... l think you should start from the first chair, and the first chair... l can`t find the first chair! -No, wait. -Where am l now? -That`s the desk, that`s the desk. -The desk? -The desk is... -So where should l be? ...three paces to the left of the first chair. Hal will be in the first chair... So l think the second sofa over here would be right. So you continue on. Wait, l`m getting confused. Two paces... left of the first chair, of the right of the sofa or the right of the desk? -The desk to the left. Right. -To the left of the desk? l remember there`s a chair on this side, right? -Yes, that`d be the second chair. -There`s a chair over here. 0ne, two, three. Did l get it? Did l get the chair? lf l`m standing facing the first chair, is it eight paces to the left... of the second sofa, or eight paces... lt`s two paces to the desk... lf they give you 50 years, l`ll be waiting. lf they give you two consecutive life sentences... l`ll be waiting. -Cut! -What did you think? l knew you could do it. l think you were great. -Did you like the cigarette? -The cigarette? That was something. That was really something. That`s just me... ...but l thought it was... -l thought so too. lt was great. -l rehearsed it all last night. -lt shows. lt`s still so hard for me to believe that you two are back together. -We sort of like to keep that quiet. -Don`t be silly! She knows our secret. What`s with the... Well, you know. We let the world know. We should do this again... because it`s gonna be a while before l get the chance to... Gosh, it`s like two dogs in heat. My God. -We gotta go to that meeting. -No, no, no! l was just getting started, actually. -That was great. -Thank you. Two paces past the clock is the first sofa. -Right. -No, two paces. Three paces is the... `Cause the bureau is past the clock. Two paces past the first clock is... -0h, God! This... -Don`t worry. Four steps. Courage. Have courage. 0kay, let`s go. l got him. l`ll wait in the lobby. -Hal. -Hi. Ellie, would you excuse us? l wanna have a little chat with Val. -Man-to-man. -Sure. l`ll go make a few phone calls. l`ll see you boys later. So, Ellie says things are going very smoothly. l said l hear things are going smoothly. -Yes, l... Two, three. -Are things going smoothly? -Yes. Things are fine. -Good, good. Sit down. Not there. 0ver here. -Where? -Here, on the sofa. 0n the sofa? The sofa is to the... Jesus. Are you okay? -Are you alright? -l stumbled. l came up short. Today was a rough day filming. Listen. Let me just get you a drink, okay? You`ll be fine. l`ve got some terrific lrish whiskey over here. lt was a gift. -No, l don`t want anything to drink. -No, l`ll tell you what, this is gonna... help you to relax after a rough day. l insist. -l`ll be alright... -Here you go. Jesus. You really are overworked. My goodness! So... ...you`re happy with the dailies? -Happy? What can l say? Everything l`ve seen so far has been great. Great. And you definitely don`t want me to see them? -l get so embarrassed when... -l just thought that maybe you`d like... an outside opinion. Sometimes somebody with a little... ...distance can be very objective. -Ellie saw the dailies and she... -l think she liked them. She said so. -Yes, l understand. l see a great deal of rough cuts. We`re not near the rough cut stage. l don`t cut the picture as l go along. l`m not one of those directors. When the picture is over, then l cut it. -You seem distracted. -Distracted? No. -l did have a difficult day. -No, you`re right. A deal is a deal. l promised l wouldn`t peek, l know... it makes you nervous and Ellie made it clear the way you like to work. A lot of people think we studio heads have no sensitivity... but l wanna assure you that we wanna make a good picture, as much as you. lt`s just that we have to be concerned with the realities of the marketplace. Would you stop moving your head like that? lt`s very distracting. -l`m sorry, l was just... -Thank you. Just feeling a little... l`m okay. 0kay. As long as you`re satisfied. l`m satisfied. l am. And l know you will be. Good. Listen. l wanna show you what we have in mind for the poster. -The poster? -Yeah. Come here. ``Come here``? Me? Yes. Well, l`m coming. -The desk? -Come here. -Come on! You are overworked. -l`m nervous. l`m impressed. You have been working hard. What are you doing? Have you developed some nervous disorder? Yes, l have a little arthritis that sometimes kicks in. So, you like`em? -Like what? -The posters. -Yes. Yes. They`re great. -Which one? -They`re all great. -My favorite: number two. This is... lt`s just great. lt`s a strong graphic. Yeah, l knew you`d love`em. So, if l did see`em, l`d never tell anybody. -See what? -The dailies. No, l`m... The problem is, l said before, l get embarrassed when... No, you`re right. A deal is a deal. Soon we`re gonna wrap the picture, so... ...we`ll cut it together and... -Am l barred from that too? No, l`d just like to present the best possible thing l can to you. Because this is a US$ 60 million movie... and l`m just not used to being kept in the background like this. Between you and me... this is my valentine to Ellie. A lot of people didn`t think you and l could work together. Personality clashes and all that personal history... but l think if two people are really mature... l`ll let myself out. lt`s okay. Don`t worry. ls the yacht available? `Cause l wanna do the whole honeymoon... up and down the Amalfi coast. But listen, it`s gotta be that yacht. Because that`s the only yacht that`s romantic enough for my honeymoon. Alright. 0kay, good. -You okay? -Yes. Yes, l`m... -Come on, l`ll show you out. -Yes. -l know you`ve had a rough day. -0h, the front door. Cut! There`s more, Mr. Yeager. But those few hours is a good selection. 0kay, Wally. Thanks. Listen... This is our little secret, okay? Yes, sir. Ladies and gentlemen, the National Society of Video Sales... is proud to honor the movie industry`s man of the year... the incomparable Hal Yeager. Time was we made more money at the box office than video sales. Now the big push we give a film for theatrical release... is really just a prelude to making it a large hit... in your over-the-counter sales. Boy, did they love you, you know. l thought they were gonna... lift you up on their shoulders and carry you around the room. l just told the truth. -You`re drunk. -0h, a little. -A little? -0kay, a lot. Definitely. lt`s not easy sitting through three hours of pure adulation. Frankly, l`m telling you. l don`t know how you can do it. You don`t wanna rob them the opportunity of showing their gratitude. No wonder we both have to drink so much at these affairs. lf l wasn`t a little drunk, l wouldn`t bring this up. -Bring what up? -The dailies. -What dailies? -Val`s dailies. -``The City That Never Sleeps``. -l`m hopeful, you know? You can`t ever judge a film by the dailies. lt`s just a bunch of little... bits and pieces out of sequence. You have to wait until the whole... -l was very disappointed. -You saw them? That`s just between us. l was somewhat disappointed. l can`t believe you! He trusted you. l didn`t get to run a studio by kowtowing to the temperamental... demands of every director who thinks he`s 0rson Welles! But you gave him your word that you were not gonna do that. Unless this guy has some vision of... how to cut this thing in his head, we are on some very shaky ground here. Well, l disagree. -l think the dailies are... -What? Nothing makes sense! The angles, the performances, the coverage. There is no coverage! -l trust his instinct. -This was supposed to be a nice... middle-of-the-road, commercial picture. That`s it. And the deal was also that you were not gonna look at his work until... ...he was ready to show it to you. -l gave in to please you. He could`ve come in and begged for the job, and he wouldn`t have gotten it. The point of this is that you said one thing to his face and then... you go and do something else behind his back. You make it sound sinister. l`m responsible for a very huge... ...chunk of money. -l know. -l have a studio to run, sweetheart. -Yes, l know. 0kay. lf you`re disappointed, then l guess you should be disappointed at me. -What`s that supposed to mean? -Because l saw some of the footage... and l was a little baffled, okay? But you know what? Maybe l should have told you... But half of it was in the can anyway, and... Look. Listen. He`s the genuine talent here, okay? Who says we`re right? He`s a genius. Let`s just hope he has some vision in his head of cutting this thing together. For all our sakes. And he never has to know that l saw the dailies. l`m not tampering. And you should`ve warned me! l don`t ever wanna wonder about you loyalties. Well... Look, l`m sorry. l`m drunk, let`s just... -Let`s just call it a night. -0kay. Cut! Val, check the gate? Check the gate. Thank you, everyone. See you at the wrap party! That was a tremendous job you`ve all done. Please use taxis or designated drivers. So l know you`re happy to be leaving New York. What is the thing... ...you miss most about LA? -Miss most about LA? l miss my support group. They`re really helping emotionally. l`m a member of a support group of film executives... who can`t afford their own G-5s. -Have you seen Val? -l don`t think he`s here. Great! A director who doesn`t come to his own wrap party. l called him at home. He`s not there. l`m worried. Hi! Ellie! 0ver here! You have to meet them. Excuse me. Excuse me. -Hi. This is Sandor. -How do you do? -Where`s Val? -He didn`t come. 0h, my goodness. Everybody`s so sophisticated. l love it. -l have your father here. -You`re joking. -Tony? Tony? -Be careful, don`t bump into anything. -l`ll wait outside. -What`s wrong with you? You blind? -Me? Yeah. -Psychosomatic? -How do you know? -You never get any real things. Here. l`ll take you to the couch. Keep walking. Alright, turn around. There you go. Sit down. -Don`t ask why l came. -l didn`t. Aren`t you curious after the last couple of years? -Are you gonna officially disown me? -No. l came for the opposite reason. -l wanna make friends. -l was never mad at you. How can you say that? You pushed me down a flight of stairs. l was high. ln those years l did drugs. l did acid and peyote. -Where did you learn to do drugs? -From you. You took all those tranquilizers and mood elevators. There`s a big difference between that and breaking into a drugstore... ...so you can buy hashish. -Those days are over. lt was stupid. What happened to us? How did we grow so far apart? We used to do things together. We were... God, you know... l played with you. l took you fishing. l didn`t wanna go fishing. l didn`t take you against your will. Then, you wanted to go fishing. You wanted to learn the violin. l got you a violin. -That led me to the drums. -Yes, but... how did violin go to the drums? That l`ve never understood. lt`s music. An electronic band where you rip off your shirt and eat a live rat... ...is not music. -We sold out that concert. And don`t call it a concert. Heifetz at Carnegie Hall is a concert. lf there`s a brownout, Heifetz will still be on key... ...but your guitar player won`t be. -You came here to knock me? l came to... ...hold out an olive branch. -An olive branch? What is this? The lsraeli Parliament? l`m your son. l know you`re my son. That`s what l`m saying, l want us to... to get back together again... ...to go fishing. -l hate fishing. l don`t mean literally go fishing in water... l`m saying that l love you despite the orange hair and the nose rings... and the nipple rings, and the tattoos. lt`s no wonder l went blind. Can l help it if l took a quantum leap from your values? What`s wrong with my values? l don`t understand. l was nice to your mother... l didn`t steal anything. l never consumed any rodents. -How is your mother, incidentally? -She`s great. They`re in Rio. She has no trouble accepting me. She has no trouble `cause you`re here and she`s moved to the Equator. l wanna be friends with you. l respect what you`ve tried to do. You have to respect my goals. l did some dopey things. l apologize. Let`s not make a big deal. We don`t have to go fishing, but we really have a lot in common. We`re both trying to do something original. You with film... and me with a live rat. Tony, Tony. By the way, l changed my name. lt`s not Tony anymore. lt`s not? What is it? Scumbag X. 0h, that`s nice. lt`s much better than Tony Waxman. l love you, Scumbag. Events moved pretty rapidly once the movie wrapped. Ellie stayed in New York and helped Val fake his way through the editing. They spent a lot of time together. And then, suddenly one day... l can see! Ellie, Ellie! l can see! -What? -l... l can see! l can see! l can see! Everything looks so beautiful to me. The city looks so... incredible! l can see! -Are you sure? -You look so beautiful. You look so great. You look so beautiful. -l swear. You`re so different. -You mean l was never pretty? You were always pretty! But now you`re beautiful. l can see! l can`t believe this! l can see. You look so beautiful. l`m overwhelmed. That`s how it is when you go blind for a while, you know. -Val! 0h, my God! -Come on! Call Dr. Kevorkian. -Val... -This is the worst... This looks like the work of a blind man! Come on, you`re scaring me. Hal means to preview this in two weeks... ...to get some audience reaction... -The audience will... rush into the projection booth, and grab the print and hurl it into the sea. -Here are the cards from the audience. -Have you looked at it? -They`re practically unanimous. -``An incoherent waste of celluloid.`` Listen to this: ``Would you recommend this film to a friend?`` -``0nly if l was friendly with Hitler.`` -These are all terrible! ``How would you improve this movie?`` ``Arson.`` -``What was the best moment?`` -That`s the audience, not critics... The reviews will be good, and the public will get with it. Sure. ``How would you characterize the genre?`` ``American garbage.`` l`m crushed over the reception the movie`s gotten. l thought some of the reviews were particularly scathing. -l hope Val`s okay. -That`s not what l wanna talk about. 0kay. l got an advance copy of the story that Andrea Ford wrote on the movie. She hasn`t even turned it in yet. She wanted some comments from me. -l tried to talk her out of it. -Look, Andrea Ford is a cheap... tabloid gossipmonger. l never thought it was a good idea having her... hang around on the set all the time... She said that Val Waxman directed the picture blind. That all throughout... the shooting he was a victim of psychosomatic blindness. Did l do wrong to deny that? He shot the whole picture without ever seeing it? 0therwise, you would have gotten the movie you wanted. She wrote that you knew about this and you helped him hide it. 0nly the last few weeks. l found out pretty much after that boat had sailed. -And you didn`t tell me? -l knew you`d be apoplectic... and Val couldn`t afford to lose another job... and under those circumstances, l... You cared more about him than you did about Galaxie, huh? l truly believed he could pull it off. And the two of you were seen kissing passionately on several occasions. We were faking. We told his roommate that we had gotten back together... so she wouldn`t move back in with him, because she`d figure out... that he was blind and blow the whole secret... Did you fall back in love with your ex-husband? You can tell me the truth, `cause it really doesn`t much matter now. l think l never stopped loving him. You know that when this story hits, he`ll never be employable again. Well, you don`t need the story. l think the reviews took care of that. l wouldn`t spend 30 seconds on what those critics said. They represent the lowest level of the culture. No, this time they`re right. The movie is incoherent. The performances are all over the place, the camera work is unfocused. Worse has been said about my work. l just eat another rat. 0h, Jesus. l hope Ellie is okay. l always liked Ellie. Didn`t l read she was marrying that quintessential... ...neanderthal, Yeager? -Talk about blindness! She was right under my nose for so long, and l didn`t appreciate her. Blindness as metaphor. That`s great. -Guess what? -Guess what? What? The movie. Your movie? The French have seen your movie in Paris... and they say it`s the greatest American film in 50 years! -You`re kidding. -You`re being hailed... as a true artist. A great genius. And France sets the tone for the rest of Europe, right? l have offers for you already to make a movie in Paris. A love story in Paris! Paris, France. Where they talk French, you know. lt`s like New York. This is the best news. This is unbelievable. Because here l`m a bum, but there... a genius. 0h, thank God the French exist. This is my life`s dream. That we`re gonna live in Paris. l can`t tell you how thrilled l am. l can`t believe it. Are you sure? l mean, it`s a really big step. l`m absolutely... You know, you look so beautiful! Every husband should go blind for a little while. You didn`t forget the Dramamine, did you?
