Come on! Hey, you, give him a hand there. Oh, Christ! Let's get outta here, huh? [Rapid gunfire] [Indistinct chatter] Let's move... come on! All right, let's get the fuck outta here. This way! Hey... hustle, hustle! Let's go... let's go! Come on! Take 'em up... Let's get out of here.

Let's go for a walk. Bobby, it's time to go. [Indistinct chatter] Okay. You be a good boy. Be careful. Maria, come here... Sit down. I gotta talk to you. Early this morning, Michael was mugged. What? His neck has been broken. God... And it seems that he's gonna be paralyzed. No! Possibly for the rest of his life. [Crying] [Machines beeping] I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. What, is this some kind of joke or something? What are you doin', what are you doin'? I'm lookin' for some friends of yours. One of them's a little guy. Wears a beret, has a beard. The other one's a big, stocky guy. Ugly, looks like an animal... You know who I'm talking about? I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. - No? - No, uh-uh. Huh... huh? Early this morning, a friend of mine got mugged. I think they did it. A black man, this morning? You know anything about that? No, I don't know anything about it. Wait, no, wait... no, no! Uh... now. Tell me where they are right now. Uh, we got a... We got a clubhouse over on barton and throop, on the... on the second floor, okay? That's it. - You sure? - Yeah. No... If you're lyin', I'll be back. No, I'm not lying to you. [Panting] I'm not lyin' to you! [Music playing] [Group chatter] [Girls laughing] [Music playing] Come on... come on. [Shouting and laughing] [Laughter] Come on, baby. [Screaming] Fuckin' animal. I said, move... Do it... get out! I'll blow your fuckin' head off. Get your girlfriends outta here. Get outta here! You're makin' a mistake, man. You're makin' a mistake, motherfucker! Get the fuck outta here. Come on, move! You hear me... get out! You, what are you doin' over there? Move... get over there. Get out! Ah! [Gunfire] Now, what did you want to say, fuck-head, huh? I'm sorry about this morning, all right? I mean, we didn't hurt you! Shit, man. That guy was just a nigger. That nigger was my best friend, you motherfucker. No! [Screaming] [Gunfire] [Sirens wailing] Where's O'Malley? - Pukin'. - Pukin'? Yeah, it was pretty bad. One of them was still alive when we got here, even though the rats had eaten off half his face. Another psycho killer, just what we needed around here. Couldn't happen to a nicer bunch. What do you mean? Somebody offed some of the ghetto ghouls? Is that what this bullshit's about? You check it out. I'll see ya down at the station house. See ya later. Hey, Dalton, you want a TV? [Police radio chatter] [Sirens wailing] Hey, Stevie, I don't wanna keep you awake or anything, you know. Thank you very much! Hey, Stevie, it ain't so bad! Yeah, let's go. Swing it in there, Steve! These comics are terrible. Whatever happened to "moon mullins,". "Maggie and Jake," and "buck Rodgers?" Do you remember "buck Rodgers?" Nah, you don't remember "buck Rodgers." I just spoke to Washington, and they're... shh! Excuse us, hon'. We got a little business to talk over. Why don't you finish your breakfast out by the pool? I'll join you in a moment, babe. Sit down. What the hell's the matter with you? You know better than to talk in front of her. The price of beef is going up too fast in New York. They feel a congressional investigation is imminent. So, what do they want from me? A four cent drop for the next six months. [Laughing] Six months, huh? Do you know how much that'll cost me? Hey, you seem like a smart, young man. You tell me, what am I payin' those guys down there for, anyway, huh? Can't they do something about it? They are doing something about it. They're giving you a warning that could save us a lot of aggravation. You can't afford to be too greedy. It's not like the old days. All right, all right, all right. Work it out! But don't you give me no crap about the old days. At least, in the old days, you could understand the comics. Today, all they got is cosmic ducks and star shit. Now, you get outta here. Don't you come back until you have something I wanna hear. Okay, Mr. pontivini. Whatever you say. - Hi, tom. - Hey, Ralph. Very good, thank you, very good. Listen, Ralph, uh... I'm lookin' for the girls that were with those, uh, ghetto ghouls on the night they were killed. You heard anything, or do you know anything? I only know one of them... candy. She works the trucks at the market. Tonight, she's wearin', uh, green hot pants and a black, sparkly blouse. That's it. That's fantastic... Thank you. Hey, uh, Dalton. I got a few parking tickets. I'll take care of 'em. Thank you. Hey, how you been? - Hey, you. - Hey, how you doin'? How are ya? Hi... I miss ya. What you thinkin'? Uh... you wanna get lucky tonight? Yeah, how much? The usual. What do ya say? - Get in. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Okay, stay there. Don't move, okay... I'm comin' around. Stay right there. - I'm right here. - Okay. The regular is $10. French is $15. And anything special will cost you $25, okay? Yeah, baby. Handcuffs, that'll be $35, okay? Uh, they're for you, baby. I'm a cop, and you're under arrest. Oh, shit, what kinda shit is this, man? You know this is entrapment, man. Aw, my man is the man, holy shit. What the fu... Who the fuck are you now? Uh, what-what's um... Where am I now? What, uh... who... What's this room? I don't understand. I never seen this place before. Nobody ever did anything. [Indistinct mumbling] Uh, is this... is... Where's everybody else? What do you want? I want the person who killed the ghouls. I don't know nothin' about that. I can't tell you... I don't know nothin' about that. I can't... I can't tell you what I don't... Wha... Those are my things. Um, do... are you... Are you new? Is this... um... Who-who-who... Who... where... Uh, gee, if i... How 'bout it? What's up? Do-do you know many, um... [crying] Wait! Please, don't go. [Crying] It's up to you. I'll talk. I'll tell ya. What did he look like? [Monitors beeping] I think it's time for us to go. Listen, would you wait for me outside? Okay. I'll be there in a minute. I found the guys that did this to you... And I've taken care of it. It was strange. It was like we were back in 'nam. It didn't matter if it was right or wrong. I just did it. And don't worry about Maria and the kids, 'cause I figured out a way to get some money for them. Don't worry. I'll be careful. Listen, do you want me to turn this television on here... just blink your eyes if you do. I'll get the nurse to come in and look after you, okay? Just hold on. Please. Focus! Get him! Come on... get him! Come on, Charlie... Get him! Thatta boy... get him! [Laughter] Hey, hey, that's it... Come on. Oh, oh, oh, oh! Come on... How about that, Tony? Not bad, huh? Come on, Scotty. You're beautiful, you know that? What a beautiful dog... Here you go, huh? Hey, somebody tries to break in there, they're gonna end up with a bloody stump, huh? Come on, baby... I'm gonna take you to the greatest steakhouse in town. Hey, how'd you like that dog, huh? Good evening. Oh, hello, there, Greg... How are ya? Will you be having the usual this evening? Oh, yeah, that'd be fine. Fine. Hey, Charlie, before I start a new meal, I better get rid of the one I had last night, huh? [Laughter] Excuse me, hon. You take good care of her, you hear? Don't worry, boss, I will. [Rustling] [Toilet flushing] [Gasping] Charlie! Tommy! Hey, you! I know you're out there, somewhere! What are you doin'? What the hell are you doin', huh?

Holy... hey, wait a minute. Look, what do you want? Look, I'll make any kinda deal with you. What the hell do you want? Hey, listen, who put you up to this, huh? That-that caputo guy, huh? Carmine caputo? You're not gonna get away with it. Do me a favor, huh? Listen... Oh, Jesus Christ. You see the thing is, my friend needs the money you've taken out of his pocket all these years. [Chuckling] Hey, hey punk, that's easy. Twenty, thirty thousand dollars... I'll give you anything you want. Just get me the hell down, ya hear? Hey, hold it, hold it. Hold it, please.

[Mourning dove calling] [Dog barking] [Dog growling] [Electric knife whirring] [Dog whining] [Coughing] [Water running] Hey, wait-wait a minute... No, no, what are you doin'? Are you crazy... Don't do that! Stop it! Jesus Christ, don't! Please, please, don't do that. Don't, don't! [Screaming] [Collective chatter] [Monitors beeping] Dalton... I didn't know you were a friend of the family. Hey, I didn't put him there. I'm tryin' to find the guy who did. Mm, sorry, I don't know why I said that. That's okay. I probably can't get anything out of him anyway, huh? I don't think so. Dalton. Uh, I-I'm sorry I'm so sarcastic. Well, that's okay. I guess we've both had a long day. Hey, you hungry? Yeah. What kind of food do you like? Anything. Like, you want a picnic? Ha... are you serious? Sure, why not? Why not, indeed. Cheers. [Giggling] This is really romantic... cheers. Is that pouilly fume? - Pouilly fume? - Um-hmm. I don't think I have... I've had pouilly fuisse. What do I do with the bones? - Back there. - Really? Yeah, the squirrels love 'em. Do you know that I lived in New York for most of my life, and I've never been to central park at night. [Whistling] [Indistinct chatter] How you doin', mama? - You goin' out? - I ain't goin' out. If you wanna let someone come in, we can do some business, man. What do I have to do? It's a hundred bucks, baby. You don't ask questions... come on. Cute. [Heavy breathing] There's this client of mine. He likes to do young boys. That's our specialty around here. This one also wants to be done by a chick at the same time. That's where you come in. Not me, man. I don't get involved with chicken hawks. I think you're pretty sick... I'm goin'. Hey, this guy's a good customer of mine. I told him I'd get him a chick, cunt. You ain't goin' nowhere. What's goin' on, here? I've been waitin' twenty minutes. - Let me go! - Shut up, bitch! She ain't bad. Yeah, she's the chick, all right, but she don't wanna do it. Well, shit, I'll go somewhere else. Now, now, wait a minute. If we discipline her a little, she'll be glad to do it. You'd like to watch that, wouldn't you? - Yeah. - No! [Whimpering] [Laughing] Eh, can I, uh... yeah, but it's gonna cost you extra. Yeah, all right. Go get your toy. No, ah! [Whimpering] No... no! No, no. [Gasping] No, no. Oh, please! [Screaming] Do you have to get up early? I'm supposed to have the day off, but, uh, you never can tell. What's your day like? So far, so good. Yes, Al, we're ready on the floor. Twenty seconds to air. Mic up, over there. Sit down, here we go, in ten... Five, four, three, two... good morning, I'm rodger grimsby. Here now, the news. Early today, the grisly remains of a reputed meat mobster, gino pontivini, were found on the floor of a warehouse in the South Bronx, beneath a huge meat grinding machine. Now police initially presumed this to be the work of a rival mob. However, a letter dropped off, apparently, late last night at eyewitness news, indicates another possibility. I quote from the letter. "The people of New York have been terrorized" "by criminals for too long." "Politicians have stood idly by" "as thugs and killers have taken over" "our streets, our parks, our lives." "As of today, this will no longer be true." "Gino pontivini will not be the last." The letter is signed, "the exterminator." In other news the nuclear regulatory commission came under fire once again... elections are just two months away. We really don't need this bullshit. Can you take care of it? Well, what do you want me to do? I think the country would be better off if this lunatic were brought to justice. I see. Arrested, brought to trial. That's not necessarily what I had in mind. I didn't think so. The trial might raise some embarrassing issues. The president's campaign promises, for example. An administration that hasn't brought about law and order for the last four years shouldn't be given a second chance. I asked you if you could take care of it. I'll take care of it. But it would be a lot easier if the New York police cooperate with us. I'll give their commissioner a call. [Collective chatter] Cocaine, joints in bags, nickel bags, man, speed... check it out, check it out. Check it out. Hey, check it out... No headphones. Yeah, fuck you, man. Hi. Hi. Goin' out? Twenty dollars for me, five for the room. No. Fifteen for me, five for the run. How old are you? Twenty. You'll catch a cold in that costume. Nah. Where's the room? [Distant shouting] You probably know the rules. Five dollars a half hour, five dollars each additional half, ten dollars deposit, I'll give you back five if you're out on time. Clean sheets five bucks extra, five bucks deposit on the sheets. You want the sheets? Yeah. You want the sheets? Oh, yeah, yeah, we gotta have the sheets. Uh, what does that all add up to? Twenty-five bucks. These are clean ones, huh? Have a good time. God, what happened to you? Who did this to you? Is that what you want? Dirty stories, is that how you get off? No. But what kind of person would do a thing like that? Some guy took me to a chicken place. Chicken place? What's that? That's where they serve young boys to perverts. I wouldn't do what they wanted. So they tied me to the bed... And took a soldering iron... I'm sorry. Listen, let's get outta here, eh? You don't belong here. I'm not gonna hurt you. Nobody's gonna hurt you again. [Grinding] [Locks clicking] - Yep. - Hey, my man. Got some chicken for sale... You hungry? Hey, I got two young boys. One's six and one nine. Their mother's a junkie. I hear she od'd about a week ago. No relatives, so you can't trace 'em. I got a great bargain for ya. Five hundred apiece... What do ya say, huh? Hey, man, sounds good. They look all right, I'll take 'em. Hey, you got pictures? You really are a sick motherfucker, you know that? Hey man, what's wrong with you? Just takin' care of business. You know, it's kinda funny. That's kinda what I'm doin' here, too. Huh. Fuckin' takin' care of business. Hey, hey, man. Hey, now, whatcha doin'? Come on, man, don't fuck around. Oh, man. Hey, hey. [Indistinct shouting] Hey, hey, don't do that. Come on, man, whatcha doin'? What are ya doin'? [Screaming] [Screaming] [Gunshot] N-n-no, please, please, no, no, no. Leave me alone. No, no. [Screaming] [Screaming] Take it easy. Everything's all right. Get your clothes, and let's get outta here. All right... That's where we stand. I don't know what we're gonna get here... good. Hiya, Dalton. It's uh, pretty, uh, gruesome in there, isn't it? Wait, hold it, Victor, hold it. Listen, can we just come in and take a quick look around. Now you know the rules. Nobody in there until 'til the ma gets here. Listen, Dalton, what do ya have on this? I just got here, Judy. I don't know... Give me a break. Come on, Dalton... You're here. It's gotta mean one thing, the exterminator. The first one was johnathon minor, age 37, male Caucasian. Forty-two arrests for promoting prostitution, assault, rape, white slavery, corrupting the morals of minors. Lately he specialized in young boys. He was convicted twice and served a total of 18 months. Jesus, it looks like he got hit by napalm. Most of that's from the burning mattress. The fireman says it's like that every time someone falls asleep smoking. Step this way... I'll show you our next attraction. Jesus. Who was he? He was a state senator from new Jersey. Hey, Dalton? Yes, Steve? I have the autopsy on the third ghetto ghoul and the print out that you ordered. I also have a telephone message from the CIA. - The c.I.A? - Yeah. An agent shore called. He wants a briefing on the "the exterminator" case. He says he cleared it with the commissioner. Here, he left his number. - Thanks, Steve. - All right. [Phone ringing] Dalton. Hi, it's Megan. Oh, hi, how are ya? How's it going? Oh, it's goin' fine. Our lab boys picked up a bloody footprint in the, uh, meat packing plant. They, uh, matched it with a size 10 hunting boot, manufactured by a firm in Maine. He only sells mail order. Well, you think he's from Maine? Well, our computer checked their records with all sale of that size with army records, and we finally have us some suspects. Why do you think he was in the army? Well, uh, one of the ghoul's girlfriends picked out the m-16 machine gun as a weapon the ex... Uh, the exterminator used when he broke up their party. About the only way you can get one is stealing it from the army. You think you're gonna catch him? Oh, we'll-we'll catch him, all right. But it's gonna take some doing. The computer gave us 2,000 suspects. Now it's gonna take a lot of knocking on a lot of doors. What are you doing right now? Uh, well, I'm a just going over some lab reports and just lookin' for clues. Do you want to take a break? Yeah. Well, there's a good jazz concert at battery park. All right, I, uh... I can be there in about thirty minutes. Good. Okay, see you there. Ladies and gentlemen, Stan guest. [Applause] [Music playing] Megan? Jalon! - Oh! - Oh, no! It's nice to see you... Holy shit! I haven't seen you since we got arrested at the army induction center in [Indistinct]. What are you doing now? I'm a doctor. Baby! I sell convertible bonds for Baldwin and byrne. [Laughter] Sounds brilliant. Hey, um, who's your friend? This is Dalton... He's a cop. A cop... that's a good one. You always did have a sense of humor. Hey, want a joint? [Giggling] You know that I have not seen jalon... For twelve years? Those were some times, huh? Yeah, they, uh... They were some times. But they were a little different for you than they were for me. What do you mean? Well, uh, I was there, and you were here. Were you really? Where do you think I was... Sarah Lawrence? What I meant was, I haven't been out with anyone who was in Vietnam before. Well, most people from scarsdale wouldn't have. I didn't say that to be mean. I know. Um, I'm sorry. What was it like? [Sighing] Um... it was bad. Not as bad as New York City, but it was bad. Hey, mama. Whoa, whoa, whoa. All right, grandma, let's hand it over. Please. My check was late, so I couldn't buy any food. I need my money, please. Lady, you are breaking my heart, here. Gimme that. [Screaming] [Belching] This is for you, and, uh, this is for you, and this is for you, and this is also for you, and this is for me. And this is for you. [Sobbing] [Giggling] Shut up, you old bitch! What the fuck is going on here? Whoa. Tryin' to be some kinda hero or somethin' here? Huh, huh? No, man. Come on, man... Let's go. Come on... let's go! [Groaning] You okay? Can I get you anything? [Screaming] Oh, stop! Pick your head up again, and I'll blow your fuckin' head off. Stay right there. Okay. [Engine starting] [Tires screeching] [Cheering] Woo! All right, all right, all right! Good to see our fuckin' guy back. You scared the shit out of him! - I can't take these guys. - And what'd we get? I can drive this fucking car better than you can. What do we get, what we get, what we get, what we get, man? What, what, what? Twenties and thirties. Oh, hey, I got it. I got eleven. Hey, man, how much money we get? Nothin'. We didn't get anything! Sam, you in there? You better give me my fucking share. - Bullshit. - There's tomorrow. Yeah, there's always tomorrow. There's always tomorrow. You pissed, you pissed, and this goes. It goes. Come on, guys, I can't drive with you guys like this! Sammy, watch where you're going. I'm watching. I'm all right, man. Jesus-sorry! [Overlapping chatter] Red light, red light. Jesus fuck! God damn it. You're fucking pushing on me, man. Who's that? Hey, it's John Wayne! It's not the same guy. Hey, it's Mr. America. I thought I told you to get out of here. Holy shit! [Gunfire] You must be thinking of somebody else, friend. Come on... Get out of here. [Tires screeching] [Engines revving] [Tires screeching] [Debris clattering] Let's finish the motherfucker. [Tires screeching] [Debris clattering] [Indistinct shouting] [Tires screeching] [Gunfire] [Horn honking continuously] [Indistinct radio chatter] [Sirens wailing] [Collective chatter] [Sirens wailing] Magnum .44. I bet it was from the same gun the exterminator used. Who the fuck are you? Agent Shaw, from the c.I.A. So far you haven't been very cooperative. And just why is the c.I.A. Interested in this case? We're interested because in these sensitive times, two months before elections, the exterminator has been stirring up a lot of resentment against incumbent politicians and the entire judicial system. This could easily be the work of the opposition party, or maybe even a foreign government. Dr., uh, Megan Stewart, please. What do you think? I think you have to take a shit. It's coming out of your mouth instead of your asshole. [Phone ringing] Hello... Dr. Stewart. Hi. - Hi, there. - Hey, listen. What time do you get off work tonight? I'm on call all night. Damn it. There is another solution. The nurses call it, "midnight admission." Midnight admission. It's, uh... it's an empty, private room. Shame to let it go to waste. Okay. See you soon. [Pa announcement] Coronary emergency. Dr. jenester, to emergency. Dr. jenester, to emergency. [Groaning] The bed's a little small, but, uh... Tilts electrically. [Laughter] [Monitor beeping] I finally got Maria to accept the money... so she and the kids should be okay. I heard about the doctor's report... and that you wanted to see me right away. [Sighing] I guess we never did bullshit each other very much, did we? So, listen, if you want me to cut you off this, uh, system here, I will. Just blink your eyes twice if that's what you want. [Monitor beeping] [Gagging] [Alarm sounding] [Flat lining] Paging Dr. jenester, Dr. jenester. [Alarm sounding] What's the alarm? Respirator failure. [Indistinct pa chatter] Hey, your fly is open. [Indistinct pa chatter] Somebody cut the wire to the respirator. Was that Jefferson? Oh, sweet Jesus. W-where are you going? That guy that just came down the hall? I think that was the exterminator. Dalton! Take care. [Siren wailing] [Collective chatter] Dalton, what the fuck? Aah. [Phone ringing] Come on, come on. - Computer center... - Yeah, Nick? This is Dalton. Now, listen. Were any of the exterminator boot suspects... Were they in, uh... Were any of them in ju... The 144th ranger battalion. That's an interesting idea. I'll find out. Okay, I'll wait here. Listen, call me as soon as you find out anything, all right? You got it. Okay, Dave. Hello, Maria. Listen, I'm sorry it's so late. That's all right. Can I get you some coffee? Uh, no, no. Would you sit down? I just want to talk to you. Maria, I just left the hospital. Maria, Michael is dead. - No. - Yes, he is. - No. - Please. No, there's still hope. No, there is no hope.
