THE ELDER BRUTUS TO AROUSE THE PEOPLE, ACCUSED TARQUIN, THE TYRANT, OF THE OUTRAGE OF HAVING CONVERTED FREE CITIZENS INTO ARTISANS AND MASONS TITUS-LIVIUS PAUL LAFARGUE, THE RIGHT TO BE LAZY It's really simple. First, the brakes. Hand brake, foot brake. Right? It's very easy. Here, you have the throttle. It works like this. It's easy. But most importantly, the gear shift. First gear. That's the key, but you'll never use it. You understood? You sure? Take my seat. I'll start the engine. Go for a little ride. Easy. Put it in first gear, shift into second gear, and go. It's not too tight? Okay. Put the shoulder pad with the satchel in the back. If that bothers you, lift it up. Go ahead. Okay, come on. Never try to force it. Always be flexible. Yes, flexible. First, we'll try with ten bottles. -See that? -Yes, sir. Your turn, buddy. There are only ten bottles. All right, put it down. Go ahead. Now there's fifteen. Go ahead. You okay? Put it down. Go ahead. Here's your float. 15,000 francs. No! Keep all of it in the satchel. Put it over your arm. Good. Now, put your money inside. Not the bills! They should go into your wallet. Yeah. The bills go into the wallet and that goes in the satchel. There you go. We're here. Yes, Friday at 10:00. Seventh floor. Of course, sir. Goodbye, sir. WINES Here. I wanted to tell you. You were never open! You're running after the ball, but the ball should come to where you are open. Right? But you played very well. Since I found a job, I'm going to quit. Quit what? Soccer. What are we going to do on Sundays? Sir! Wait. Here you go. Take it. Thank you. Oh, dear… Leave my slippers on. What about your bill? No, it's okay. How much? -How much? -No, it's okay. Nothing. How are you? NOE WINES I start there, and I finish there. Is it dirty here? So-so. Cigarette butts, papers, dog poop. It's not a street. It's a dog's toilet. Anyway, pay my bill. Goodbye, madam. Goodbye. Goodbye, sir. Goodbye. How are you? Good. I'm going to try to get married. Good night, Dad. Good night, Mom. It's normal, you know. It's normal at your age. It's normal! It's normal! -Come on, at your age… -It's normal. It's normal. Dad… Of course, at your age it's only natural. Anyway, it's normal. Here we go. You want to come upstairs? No. -A couple of minutes? -No. You don't need us. -You go ahead. Go! -Go on! Come on! No. I can't leave your mother alone for too long. Yes, of course. Now they're faster, but they don't last as long. -It's a nice little car. -Yes. -Are you getting tired? -No. I'm light, aren't I? Denise! Your shoulders aren't the same height. She's better off. Good. Keep holding your left foot like that. I'll get my license. It's the truck. The difficult part is the truck. Especially since I don't know anyone at headquarters. When you don't know anyone… Listen. Tomorrow, I'm going to headquarters. They might give me a truck. Come in. Hello, madam. NOE WINES -Sir. -You're the driver? -Yes. -Come in. I have my license. Close the door. Sir. Sit down, young man. You made a request for a truck? Yes. That's not how it works. You have to have seniority, your bosses' trust. Today, the drivers are on strike. We can test you… right now. Give me the deliveries. Mr. Gaspard, can you come up, please? In a month, or ten years, if you go on strike, we'll take the truck back. No one will defend you. Find him a truck. He's starting today. You can leave. I wanted to talk to you. I have something to-- I have something to tell you. Yes. See you tomorrow. Here, 456. Get undressed and put this on. Hurry! Get dressed! You're ready. Come on. Move out the way! Come on. Let him by. It's this truck. Get in. Come closer. I don't bite. Small first gear, large first gear. Small second gear, large second gear. You change gear range. Here's the safety brake. Oil pressure, brake pressure, etc. Let's go. What do you want for dessert? Again? -Hi, Paulo. -Hi. -How are you, Paulo? -Hi. NOE WINES Come on. Nice, isn't it? Yes! What a great truck! How are you? I wanted to go to the countryside. Three plates and the bread. No. Sit down. Later. I'm busy in the kitchen for now. He said, "If you go on strike in a month or ten years, we'll take the truck back." He told me, "No one will defend you." That's disgusting. What's disgusting? If not for that, I'd never have gotten the truck. What do you want for dessert? -Come in! -Come in! Dad! That's right! Just in time for dessert. You might as well sleep over. Yes. I'll go to my cousin's. Well, kids… we're going to have fun. Here are the nicest ones. Here you go. The nicest ones. No. I didn't feel like punching in. Just like that? Meh… I thought… I thought to myself, "I'm retiring in ten years." Right? "So just retire now." You'll notice that I didn't chicken out. I waited until I was certain. I watched them punch in for ten minutes. At least ten minutes. After that, as I was certain, I took off. Here's Germaine. What? You need to get moving, kids! -Here. -Thank you. I wonder if he saw you earlier. Given the conditions, I never should have taken the truck. Obviously. Spades again? Well, I'm going in. If it's about money… No! That's not a problem. As long as you're working. So what is it, Dad? You share your table and your house with me. -I hope you don't have those scruples! -No. I need a woman. Come on. I'm not thinking about your mother. Well, yes, I am. But not for that reason. What reason? -A woman. -Yes. A woman, now and then. Like a mistress. Right. So I was thinking… What can we do about it? What can we do about it? Well, actually… you see… calmly… now and then… Right? I'm thinking. There's no need. Germaine. Germaine? Yes. Are you guys okay? One, two, three. One, two, three, four. -Well… -Yes? Dad and I… -We want to ask you something. -Yes? -Did you wash the dishes? -Yes. You… We could have helped you. Yes. Helped me? No. One, two, three, four, five… Dad's happy here, but he's missing something. Well… Occasionally. Let's not exaggerate. What? What's missing? Dad's not old. Right? Well, not old enough to… Especially now that I'm not working anymore. Right! He's no longer tired or anything. So there's no reason not to. Right? No. There isn't. So every now and then? Just like that? During the day? Or in the morning? Yes. Even… not that often. As friends. Absolutely! You two look so embarrassed. The fact is… Well! Of course. Is that so hard to say? Of course, I will. One, two, three, four, five, six I can't-- She's sleeping. I'm not used to getting up late. But I'm really happy to be staying here. I'll take care of everything. Don't move. You're not eating? No. Later, with Germaine. Lucky man. -At what time are you punching in? -At six o'clock. Obviously! Is the truck working well? Don't stand here like that. You'll catch a cold. I'm taking my slippers off. What were you saying about the truck? When? -Bye, Dad. -Have a nice day. If Dad wants to go out, give him some money. Of course, honey. He's great, isn't he? Both of you are! You're both great. Tourcoing. Here is fine. Could you take the crate down for me? -Is it enough? -Yes. I'm just going to get some sun. That's not all. How much do I owe you? What do you think? It's a nice design. Take it off. -No? -Take it off! So? Meh. It's not my size. That's it. It's not her size. How is it? You don't like it? -How much? -Fill it up. Going back to Paris? Gas is fine. But I've been breathing diesel for the past 25 years. I can't stand that smell anymore. I punched in here for 25 years. I never missed a day. That's a long time. Meh! In my cap. I put it in my cap! -Hello. -Hello. That's quite a dad you've got! Look what he stole. Not bad, huh? -Really? He stole her? -Yes. I stole the dress. Only the dress. This is my son. A girl. It's like that every night. Kids… we're going to have fun. That's the way to sing. Four times a day, for 25 years, deducting public holidays, how many times have I punched in? For all we know, my father's running your factory. Yeah, maybe. Well, she's a suck-up. But for my pleasure. To pleasure! Absolutely! Us too. -We met in a store window. -Yes. When I saw your legs, I decided to quit soccer. Let's steal some champagne and celebrate tomorrow! -Tomorrow's Sunday. -Yes. Well, kids… -We're going to have fun. -Doing what? -You know how to play belote? -Yes! To belote! -To belote! -To belote! Who wants dessert? Guess who? My boss's daughter? I can't believe… I bought the bread but stole the croissants. A family of thieves. -Tell me. -Yes? Tell me, your mother… No. Let's not talk about that, Dad. You were right. She was tired, unhappy. Come on! Weren't you surprised by her accident? No. You don't say. That's strange. Everyone thinks it's normal. Still… Still… at one point, I wondered… I wondered if she had killed herself. You see? She was tired, unhappy. She was complaining. And she was whining, the poor thing. It couldn't have gotten better. You think? I'm sure. I like the accident better. She didn't see it coming. She didn't see it coming. You think? I'm sure. It wasn't an accident. It's a beautiful day. Yes, it is. It wasn't an accident? No. Well. It was me. I did my duty. Duty? And… how did it happen? Well, she had taken sleeping pills. So I turned on the gas. And I went to hide in the bathroom. I opened the window. And I hesitated about staying with her, but I got scared. Because I wasn't sleeping. I locked myself in there, and that's it. And… did you wait long? Yes. A long time. It was hard. I imagine. I did my duty. Yes. You understand? Right? Yes. Yes, Dad. Don't call me Dad anymore. -I'm sharing your house. -Yes. I killed your mother. I'm making love to your wife. Call me… Paulo. Paulo. -Tomorrow, I'll go get my record player. -No kidding? -I'm giving it to you. -Really? Here are the girls. Happy birthday! She's really sweet. The four of us are really good together. -To punching in! -To pinching! To Paulo! To the four of us! It's not restrictive. That's incredible. Incredible. No one's going in? Then I am. Already incredible. Your dad's terrific. Hearts are trumps, right? Unbelievable. It's time, honey. -I don't want to go to work. -Then stay. No. Careful, you're uncovering her. No! Stop it! Now, the other one! Look. She's really cute. Saintes, half and half. I'd like some orange marmalade, please. Yes. Thank you. Is there any more coffee? Coffee? Excuse me. -Do you want a croissant? -I do. Thank you. Want some sugar? Some butter, please. I'm taking your spoon. Yes, thank you. -Can I borrow your knife, please? -My knife? -I want butter! -Thanks. -Butter? -Yes. Hey! This bra's a little too big for me. You wear bras? Well, no. I don't. So? -I don't steal what I want. -Is that so? -Let me see. -You'd look good in this. -I'm curvier than you. -I like your breasts. Ouch! Don't touch me, your hands are freezing! See you later! Bye, sweetie. Bye, darling. See you, guys! Are you going far? To Kremlin-Bicêtre. I'll take you. What are you going to do in Kremlin-Bicêtre? -Pick up a friend. -A friend? He's a Negro. A Negro sweeper. Are you in a hurry? Yes! Paulo! Champagne. Hey! Champagne! Champagne! It's a gift from my boss. He did well. Thank you. -I like stolen champagne. -Thank you. Thanks. To the ones punching in! One, two, three! To the ones punching in! Listen, kids. Listen, little ones. Listen. This is what I suggest… Go ahead, Paulo. Your dad's terrific. Tomorrow… or in a while… if the weather is nice… we're going south! South? -To the South! -To the South! It's hard to see. If it was a full moon, we would already know. There! Hey! Yup. I can't see anything. So? It's going to be a bloody good day! I'm telling you. -Yet, I don't know anything about it. -Absolutely. Come on! Let's go! Come on! This is it. I'm sure. -You forgot something? -On the contrary. I'm having a baby. Paulo! What's going on? What's happening? What's up? Subtitle translation by: Lucie Monteau
