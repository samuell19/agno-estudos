One in love with her fell, another yearned his love to tell, a third pierced his own heart his thirst to quell. His thirst to quell. I returned to a region in the foothills. Not as one who’d been born there, but as the person I imagined myself to be in this world. I went back to the estate that now belonged to me. I intended to manage it with ingenuity and the humility of my forebears. They constructed an artful system of eight interconnected ponds that honored the site’s origins and the landscape given them. They built it where ponds and marshes had always been. The work made them accessible and granted man the benefit without taking away the swampy region’s natural beauty and purpose. Yes, it was now to be my responsibility. I admit, however, that I returned for a different reason. I hoped I would be alone here and find a place to quiet my soul. CHAPTER 1 – PASSION SUNDAY Whoa! Like a bird in its nest or a bee in its hive, native sons lay aside their quest when the dinner guests arrive. Welcome, Lord, with this song back to the heart of your native land. Today after your pilgrimage long a well-deserved rest is at hand. We welcome you, we welcome you. Ave Maria, Ave Maria, we welcome you. Welcome, Herr Baron... -Please speak Czech. -Of course. I’m Matěj Kolář, the local mayor. Your esteemed Lordship, everyone here who live on your estate, built in ages past by your most honorable family, are thoroughly delighted by your arrival. We finally have the honor of meeting Your Lordship. From time immemorial this region has flowed with milk and honey, and it flows still... His Lordship has had a long journey. Yes, from time immemorial this region... -Thank you, Mayor. -I am at your service. Thank you for the kind welcome. I thank you all! The pleasure is all ours. -Who said that? -I did! Heavens, my lord, I beg your gracious pardon. Kateřina Kolářová. Johann Salmon de Caus. If you are indeed pleased by my presence, then the pleasure is mine as well. Let’s go! I beg your most gracious pardon, my lord. Nothing to worry about. At least it wasn’t so desperately dull. I’m raising her myself. It’s been ten years, since my wife died. That girl is nothing but trouble. She wanders off, sometimes she’s gone for days. She doesn’t want to go to church, she shows contempt for everything, and she indulges in delight... She’s young. My, oh my... -I did warn you... -Not enough! Of course, the manor is still available, if it please you. I had enough of manor houses in France and Germany. Now I want to know the land of my ancestors. It’s perfect. Francl! Have the cellar cleaned out. Make sure they fix the lock. -Of course, sire. -What’s not to like? Everything! Sire, let us return to Bavaria. Or what about France? Or Třeboň at least? But there you always complained that your back hurts. Wouldn’t want the dandy to get dirty... Wait! Sire, where should that one go? Leave it here for now. Careful! Ah, my first visitor. Welcome, teacher. Have you come to help? As a matter of fact, yes. After you. I must admit, as a patriot, that I am pleased by your Czech allegiance. I’m certainly not saying that Germany doesn’t have its geniuses... Ludwig Feuerbach? This book has been banned. Like to borrow it? My father exhorted me to protect this collection with care. He likely inherited it from our forebears. He was completely devoted to his work: the construction of beloved fountains that he created with remarkable skill and imagination. He certainly did not wish to enlarge the collection. In this we agreed. We carry death from our midst to let the new year enter in... And you, St. Margaret, once again be sure to bless our every grain. So that we may drink to Him, the Lord our Savior praises brim. After drinking the sacrament down we smash the bottles to the ground... We carry death from our midst to let the new year enter in... And you, St. Margaret, once again be sure to bless our every grain. Please look after every crop, may God’s granting never stop. We carry death from our midst to let the new year enter in... Dear St. Peter will us enjoin to opine, bringing alone a basket of wine. So that we may drink to Him, the Lord our Savior praises brim. After drinking the sacrament down we smash the bottles to the ground... We carry old dame Death to drown her final breath! Come on! Closer, closer... Oh, love is never fun, when two want the same one. Oh, love is never fun, when two want the same one. One makes her every vow, one loves her here and now, but in the end they love none. One makes her every vow, one loves her here and now, but in the end they love none. Hey! Look! No, I’ll go. Jakub! I just wanted to have some fun with the brazen lad. Look out! Things went a tad wrong. My Jakub... Since it was a done deed, family tradition demanded that I expand the collection with a new specimen. The pleasure is mine. CHAPTER 2 – EASTER After our talks but before we’d part, I used to kiss your lips and your heart. And when you reached out with your white hands, each vein in my body could understand. Let’s go! Let’s go! Straight! Straighten it up! Pull now, heave! One... and two! Straighten it! One... and two! Straighten it now! Now heave, heave! Strike it well! Take this! Is it alright? -I think so, yes. -Come here a moment. Do you know how they build a dam in Bavaria? -No. -Well... But I know how dams are built here. Why are you piling those there?! Mr. Francl, this is where the dam continues. -Yes, exactly, exactly. -Here. -Where your finger is, exactly. Whoa! So here you are! Matějka! What do you have to say? Are we taking on other work without permission? -Head Forester, sir, I... -Shut up! You’ll pay for this! Did the Head Forester perhaps not deign to notice that these men are now in the service of the Baron? I know, but... Perhaps you object to them working for the Baron? No, of course not, but... I’m so glad. I’m not sure if the Baron would enjoy hearing that his workers are being threatened. And now you’re slowing them down. I’ll take it up directly with the Baron. That would be best. Matějka! Giddyup! Mr. Francl, do they build dams differently in Bavaria? No, the same. How did you like the Voltaire? Have you read it? Well, I started it, but then Katynka Kolářová wheedled it from me. Is that alright? Miss Kolářová reads philosophical tracts? Anything she can get her hands on. And she understands? She was my student. So clever. A gifted child in all aspects, like none I’ve taught before or since. If she were a boy, she’d be studying medicine in Prague. Or for the priesthood. I doubt it. I noticed that she was... Exceptional! My lord... May I? Here! -But, my lord... -This spring is much stronger. Trust me. Behold the cross upon which died the Savior of the world. We worship you, Lord Jesus Christ. Oh, my beloved, my darling... Oh, my beloved... ...my darling... Are you so fast asleep? I’m calling to you, but you don’t respond. Once again, thank you for the help, my lord. Is it flowing well? None living have seen the like of it. Then I must come have a drink. May I ask where you learned the skill? From my father. I guess it’s in our blood. My lord! Excuse me, Father, I had to get some air. I have a matter I’d like to discuss with you. -Proceed. -Not today. A Christian’s mind should not be occupied with worldly affairs on Good Friday. Tomorrow then? It would be my honor. Good morning. And to you. -I see that you’re an early bird. -Am I intruding? Not unless my work clothes bother you. To be honest, I find it more pleasant than what you normally wear. Don’t be offended. May I? I’m not sure that’s a good idea. There’s quite a mess. What a wonderful smell. Those weeds are wilting; best to dry them in the attic. What’s in there? Whatever’s in there won’t wilt. Strange... It’s made of pear wood but it smells like linden. Come, let’s go into the house and have some coffee. -Thank you. -Welcome. Your bishop would not likely be pleased by your library. Would yours please him? I’m not a servant of God. I own those books and I have studied them. That doesn’t mean I agree with their message. That’s true; I have a Bible at home. A person must know his enemy. Take a seat. Delicious. So unexpected this far from Vienna and Prague. It’s from Lipá; the local merchant is well supplied. Why do you live here and not at the rectory? I made those rooms available to the school. A noble gesture. Gesture? I have modest needs; I have plenty of room here. You also chose a hovel over a manor house. And you have only one manservant. Considering the number of servants retained by other lords, that strikes me as rather odd. I, too, am a modest... creature. I must be near the ponds. I could not oversee their repair from a manor house. What did you want to talk about? About Kateřina Kolářová. Since her mother’s death, her faith has withered, and since the unfortunate death of that boy, Jakub, she has entirely stopped going to church. You saw for yourself. Such ado about one lost sheep? Don’t make light of it, my lord. A fundamental paganism remains among the local populace. It may set a dangerous precedent. What do you want from me? Am I to order her? Faith cannot be forced. Take her away from here. Me? You are the only one who can. You have the means, you give people work, you take care of them. Help her. And thereby help us all. The teacher also thinks Katynka is exceptional. The teacher is a dunce. We have a lot in common, Mr. Fidelius. What do you mean? We both read forbidden books, we live in hovels, and we’re both interested in the girl. I’ll take my leave. My lord! Miss Kateřina. Thank you for lending it to me. But I gave it to you. -I’d like... -Would you like to come to lunch tomorrow? I would be delighted. Yes, one of them... Shouldn’t you ask your father first? Tomorrow at noon then. Did you forget how to knock? This one, sire? Francl! Iron my tie. And bring me my brooch. -Your brooch? -My brooch! Which one? Francl! The one I got from Princess Hohenlohe. All this fuss for a village mayor. Just get moving. Oh, and tell Matějka that we’ll be replacing the old sluice gate -with a new feed pipe. -Sure... I went to take a look. The dam isn’t stable and this will work better. All will be done... after the holiday. Yuck! Frogs? Yes, frogs and snails. It beggars belief. Imagine eating such filth. And do you eat them too? The French king himself considers them a delicacy. -They really are very tasty. -Yuck! What appetites you have... Thank you, the goose was excellent. Better than frog? Excuse her. Have you also been to Venice? Do the houses really stand on water? They stand on wooden pylons driven into the sea floor. Isn’t Othello set in Venice? Yes. But I don’t remember lending it to you. The priest lent it to me. A beautiful story. And sad. Killing your beloved? He thought she’d betrayed him. He still didn’t have the right. No one has the right to kill. I guess that can’t happen at French court. You’d be surprised what goes on there. Please, tell me what goes on there! Well, there’s plenty of music and dance. And Versailles has a gorgeous theater. I don’t understand you. Why give up such a life to come here? -The incessant travel... -I’d leave right now. I’d travel the whole world and see with my own eyes all the things I can only read about here. At a certain point I realized that it’s not the life for me. Are you well, my lord? Yes... Yes. In short, I needed a rest. Also, I promised my father I’d make his native land thrive. And you’re succeeding. The people like you. All of them? Let’s go for a stroll so as not to disturb him. But you have to tell me stories. This way. All of the places I love that adorned my region seemed even more beautiful in her presence. What was going on inside me? Something unknown was suppressing ancient and predatory animal instinct. My quickened pulse did not signal a lust for taking, but a desire to give. With the deepest humility and humbleness we request with all respectfulness, let it not please you to castigate us, when they recognize our errors. Our recited portrayal is about the innocent martyrdom of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. Now kindly lend your attention since we’re about to perform it. My jolly companions and friends, death will soon make our ends. Thomas, Peter, and John so dear, I die for you and you drink for cheer! Spirits so fine, distilled from the vine, you always warm me better than that wife of mine. -Ha! That’s not true, Josef. Want a swig? -Sit down! Francl? What slops are these? Go have something decent, lads. Mr. Matějka, excellent work, thank you. Thank you, my lord. Greetings! Oh, excuse me... Deepest obeisance, Your Lordship. Would you care to join us? Out, Klaus! Can’t you see that the Baron wants to sit down? -Have a seat. -Back off, Kabelatsch! Come now, no harm intended. Please... -I’m not alone. -I get it. Miss Kolářová. What a filly, eh? I’d ride her too. -What’s she like? -Shut your mouth! Wait! Fine, fine... We need to talk. Listen, you’re poaching my people and ruining wages – it’s not done. We have to stick together. We both want to profit. Enough! Before the cock crows today, I must forever sail away. Dear boatman of the river tide, please take me to the other side. I have neither boat nor oar and the water took all my store. Pepina stroked the young man’s brow, yesterday’s youth today is drowned. How may I treat the slain in order to give him life again? Why the fuss? You’ve done better for yourself! Ow! How dare you! -Stop it! -That’s enough! Leave her alone! Tomorrow I’ll have the entire village brought together. No, don’t! Just let it go, my lord, they’re drunk. You should’ve seen it last year, when a tree fell on young Janoušek! Or when Peškovej’s daughter ran off with some acrobats. What a brawl there was. This year it was my turn. I’m an idiot for not guessing since they were so secretive about it. The teacher is an imbecile, that’s no secret. You’re a generous soul. But I don’t forgive slights. Thank you, my lord. Ah, Your Lordship! Two days later they found him and his shoe. It was still serviceable but the Head Forester was not. After a few weeks he was entirely forgotten. CHAPTER 3 – MAY Oh, my heart so blue, have you split in two? Burning like a fire, like a heavy stone of desire. Like a granite stone... Me, a king? What will I do? Exactly what lords do: nothing, just sit. Please, my lord. It’s May. We should thank the earth. And make an offering: we need rain. Agreed. But wait two more days. Why? Two days. -What now needs our grain? -What now needs our grain? It needs to feel the rain, it needs to feel the rain. That May-time gold: We make so bold a downpour to behold, a downpour to behold. Stop this instant! Stop! This is Godless paganism! Christ demands no sacrifice! Only love! You wish to encumber your soul with sin? All we want is rain. Then pray! Prayer does nothing. -God knows best. -So God wants us to die? And you support this, my lord? I thought you were an educated man. Perhaps a bit eccentric, but not an obscurant! Calm down, Father Fidelius. We’re just celebrating May. May?! You must stop this. That wouldn’t be very prudent. -No! -A sacrifice will bring rain. This is utter nonsense! Don’t do it, Katynka. Katynka, do you know from where this water comes? Heaven? This water is very old. These drops are from the Nile, collected by a slave girl into a clay pitcher, poured on the hunched back of her master. They dispersed when she aired the room and rose above the walls of Aswan into a slipstream over the desert. They didn’t remain there long because water’s immortality lies not in stasis but in eternal return. The water that runs off your hands was once the sea and an ice floe that twice circumnavigated the globe. Little, girl, little you hold, little love for me. Night or day you always told you’d give it up freely. You promised to give me what I knew to be thine – a couple of kisses, even three that would be just mine. CHAPTER 4 – ST. JOHN’S DAY In the backyard grass uncut for years, a maid stares straight, eyes wet with tears. The drops fall free as she stands alone, boring holes the pure white stone. What a world, what a world! Woman sits while man scrubs floor. Shouldn’t you be at church? Dammit all... -Francl, don’t you want help? -Sure, but the master would flay me. Francl, have you been with the Baron long? Soon it will be 20 years that we have been together. Did the Baron ever marry? No. But he hasn’t been alone the whole time, eh? Listen, Miss, I can’t say. Come now, Francl, I’ll finish your scrubbing. No, impossible. Francl! Alright, I’ll tell you. I simply don’t know. Francl! But I really don’t know. Of course, there have been girls, many. And has he never fallen in love? All I can say is that we moved whenever that seemed to happen. Francl, wine. Well, was he furious? Yes, the priest was. I don’t understand. Such a well-read, educated man. -Must he act this way? -He must. It’s kind of you to let me come. What did you read about today? About Corsica. Have you been there? Is the sea truly so huge? Without end. -And the water is salty? -Unfortunately. Nothing for our folk. I’d like to see it too. Maybe someday you will. MY DEAREST MADAM, I CORDIALLY INVITE YOU TO JOIN ME ON A TRIP TO... What time? At 8. Whoa! After you. I had a dove in a trunk concealed, he flew away to an open field. To an open field by an oaken grove, he cooed to himself, my golden dove, my golden dove. That one was my favorite when I was a little girl. Do you have children? I’d first need a baroness for that. Why don’t you have one? It’s not so simple with me. You keep getting farther away. Look, Castle Bezděz! No one ever conquered it either. Wow! How do you do that? How can I... -Can I try it too? -No! What happened? You almost drowned. How did you do it? Walking on water. It’s a trick. My father learned it in the New World. You compress air beneath your feet, thereby creating an invisible cushion that breaks on contact... You saw me naked? You are beautiful. And you’re lovely even while spitting up water. Thank you for a beautiful day. Will you stay to supper? It’s late. You can spend the night. You may go. Here we are, my lord. Goodnight, my lord. Enter. Forgive me, my lord. I forgot. I’m indebted to you for saving me. My father brought me silk thread from Lipá. Thank you. -Farewell. -Farewell. -Farewell. -Farewell, Katynka. Farewell. Miss Katynka, I have the translation of Diderot that I promised. Mayor, please find me some additional men. We need to dredge Koňský pond; it’s more full of mud than water. Of course, my lord. Good morning. I must thank you. You saved her soul. The village is a-buzz with it. So... you’re leaving? Lovely the meadow, young and merry. Call on an angel, King, please hurry. May he fly the good souls to bliss... -We’re rehearsing a play. -You sure forgot about Jakub quick! He’s right! You said you wouldn’t set foot in church again, and that you’d do whatever you want. -Instead, you hang on His Lordship. -And he doesn’t even act like a Lord. Go on then, kill me! Lady Baron! -Lady Baron! Lady Baron! -Stop! Leave her alone! Katynka! Lady Baron! I don’t belong to anyone. So prove it. Tell him to jump in a lake! What is her coquetry hiding? Mere lust that until now was just my animal nature? Or are her feelings deep enough to bear the burden of knowing my true face? I began to realize that the rage that wracked me was fear of losing her. Lovely the meadow, young and merry Call on an angel, King, please hurry. May he fly the good souls to bliss and may the devil your bad soul miss. What about green King John, the rotten ruler? Can’t wash away what the innocent bled, but we can off with a bad lord’s head. Death! Death! Death! Death! Death! Death! CHAPTER 5 – THE MOWING Come out, come out, my love true, the knife up my sleeve I’ll sink into you. I’ll sink it in you or perhaps into me: our love should end, you must agree. Our love should end... What happened, Father? -What are you running from? -I’m driving the disease from my body. -And even my physical strength. -When it’s too much. It’s not a sin, not this. Our Lord blessed me with a strength that I must not use like other men. To rid myself of awkward thoughts I pray and run in the woods. You have awkward thoughts, Father? I am only a man, just like you. I doubt that. And does Katynka come into your thoughts? Another not likely. It’s not just desire. You truly care for her. -I have to run. -Where? I have to run! Help! Help! Help! Help! My Lord, I’m in here! -Is someone there? -It’s me, sire, hurry! Hurry! Dammit, Francl, what have you done here? That damned door closed on me and got stuck. What were you doing down there? I went to get some meat to thaw out for tomorrow. Will you thaw out? I like you, sire, but only sometimes. They have a similar frozen pit at Lemberk Castle. The cook there told me once about a doe they didn’t quite fell. And what’s more they neglected to gut and skin it. Straightaway they just tossed it into that frozen hole. And after about a week they pulled it out and put it on top of the big oven the better to thaw it and cut up. And the doe... Oh please, you sloshed it everywhere! The doe suddenly rose up and jumped right over the cook’s head. I swear! Then the doe stopped and fixed him with this long look with her sad eyes. Then she ran back into the woods. Francl, you’re inventing again... Just the ending, but she really came back to life. -Frozen meat can’t revive. -Why not? Just look at me: Tea and rum did the trick! Music! Now one for me. “Reverend Sir.” Reverend Sir, by just a blonde one you missed, you missed the hairy one. What, what? Don’t you know how to make it go into the right one? -May I have this dance? -No. Come now, Katynka, you won’t brush me off... So here’s where your lashes went, Father. They were hunting for you, my lord. The girls asked after you. They’ll stop asking as soon as they see me dance. I’m as stiff as wood. But even that can be fun. -My lord! -My lord, come dance with us! Where is the wine, my dear? Is there a cellar here, my doll? It is no deadly sin, anyone who sneaks in will have it all. It is no deadly sin, anyone who sneaks in will have it all. -My lord, come. -I’d rather not. -Come, I’ll teach you. -Katynka, please, no! Monster! Monster! I saw it! I saw the monster! Come on! Come on! A fish with legs! What happened, sire? You louts! What’s going on here? Sire, wait! This is how you treat the lord of the manor?! It’s him! It’s him! It’s the monster! So you’re the one who stole it? You bumpkins! You ungrateful numbskulls! Stop this! No! Have you gone mad?! There are no monsters! Just the devil! I saw him! A fish with legs! You don’t actually believe this prattling idiot! It’s him! The Baron! But you already know that! You are in league with him to seduce innocent souls! Hypocrite! Go home! Go on! Bring water, Francl, lots of water. Right... Right away, sire. If I can first just... Francl? Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen. You should leave the area, my lord. People start to believe you’re a monster. Maybe they’re right. They’re superstitious cretins. Because they believe in something different from you? In something that was here long before your crucified one? What is more powerful? Swallowing a wafer at mass or dancing beneath the full moon? You talk like an execrable pagan. You’re worse than the devil. I have no other choice. This is how I was created. And what about you, Father? You fight against voodoo dolls but you stick your “reverence” into one of them? You’re as cold and slimy as a snake. What are you? What are you? That blockhead teacher was right. You animal. You’re the one who taught me duplicity and hypocrisy. I admit that I yielded to her. Like everyone else. Like you. Loving that girl cast me to the very bottom, and you brought me back from it. -I did? -Yes. I know what I must do now. You dress like a man but you’ll never be one. I feel sorry for you. I had to leave. But not without her. Sleep, my love, sleep. I will watch over your soul so that I may return it to you when the time is right. As soon as I rid myself of the animal within me. Then I will awaken you to a world of harmony and beauty. SOME TIME LATER Oh love, love, you are constant never. Oh love, love, you are constant never, like the water between banks of a river. Oh water, water, rush to the sea. Oh water, water, rush to the sea, wash away my tears, wash the anguish from me.
