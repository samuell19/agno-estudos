¶ I'm gonna live my life just like a holiday ¶ ¶ I will not work, no, not for another day ¶ ¶ Since I met you, I will not waste a single day ¶ ¶ From now on, my life's a holiday ¶ ¶ The wind it's cold outside, ¶ ¶ And a gloomy sky ¶ ¶ But inside of my mind, ¶ ¶ Oh, the sun is shining ¶ - Zoe? Hey. - Hi. - Hey, how you doing? - Good, good, oh. - European. - Yeah. - Sorry I'm late. - That's all right, I just got here. - Cool. So, finally. - Yeah, you were tough to get a hold of. - Yeah. - Do you live far away? - No, just a couple miles away. - Oh cool, yeah, me too. - Great. - Cool. - Tickets? - Yes. - Let's go get' em. Okay. ¶ Since I met you, I will not waste a single day ¶ - Hello. Hi, just picking up tickets I booked online. I got them here, actually. Hang on a second. - There's no signal in here, you're gonna have to go outside. - Okay yeah. Just give me a second. - Okay. Long night, huh? - Yeah. - Crossword, yeah that's hard. - Yep. - Found it. Voila. - Yeah, you're good. - Great. We'll also take a medium popcorn, and what do you want to drink? - Water's fine. - Make that two waters, please. - No more popcorn, we're closed. - What do you mean no more popcorn? There's a machine with a bunch of popcorn inside of it. Can't you just serve it to us? - See the clock? It's 10:15. - I can't see a clock. - No popcorn after 10. Rules. - Right. It's not a gin and tonic. It's popcorn. - Jerry, can I sell the popcorn? Jerry says no popcorn. That's a negative. Rules are rules. - I didn't hear his answer clearly. Are you sure? - Nevermind. Haven't you heard? Popcorn's dangerous after 10. What are you thinking? - Who knows what I was thinking. I don't know what to say. - Thank you. - Enjoy your movie. - So many questions. Who's Jerry, where's the clock? I think we're in this row. - Yeah, 'cause there's so many people in here. I don't care. - One, two, three, four. Yeah. - Do you mind? Just in case someone else sits there. - If you prefer, we can go back there. - No, no, that's fine. You're fine. We're fine. I've been looking forward to this movie for a while. - Oh yeah? - Yeah, I saw the trailer three months ago. - Cool. - Big DeNiro fan. - Yeah. Hathaway's pretty clutch. - Clutch? - Yeah. - I don't know this word, clutch. - Where did he get the popcorn? - Just stay leave it, just leave it. - I need you to clarify. I'm gonna go back. - Look. - Why? - Just leave it be. He needs it more than you do, okay? - Oh. - Wow, that's horrible. - I'm gonna-- - No, look, the movie's about to start. - Seriously? All right, fine, sure, I'll just have a water. I love water. - Me, too. - Mmm. - What? - There's so many other seats. - Just wait, just leave it. Are you enjoying the movie so far? - Yes, it's good. - That transvestite DeNiro twist was weird. Didn't see that sex change happening. - No, it was cool. - I just want to watch the credits. Got a friend of mine. He's a dog handler. - Sure. - I just wanna see his name. It's just coming up. - No, it's fine. - Also, it might be like, one of them deleted scenes. - Mmm. - Always happens. - Yeah sure, sure. - Must be a different film, I guess. - Good to go? - Yeah, we're good to go. Did you lose something? - My phone? Oh. - Maybe it dropped out when you were snoozing. - Okay, I was thinking, and I can't think when it's too bright, so. - Gotcha. - I was resting my eyes. - Yeah, yeah. Ow. - Ooo, careful. Did you like the film? - Come on, I mean, who buys the story of an 80-year-old grandpa who gets an unpaid internship, and then still gets to bang the massage therapist? I mean, completely logical. - Did you check your jacket? I thought there was a lot of hope in the movie. I mean, that you can still get the masseuse even though you're 80. - Hmm, that's fair, I can see it. Oh here. - Oh, oh good. - Great. That was fun. - Yeah. - Ready to go? I gotta get going. - Yeah, I've gotta go as well. I haven't fed my dog. I forgot to, didn't have time, and feed the plants. - Yeah, I really need to pee, so. Let's go. - Pee away, yeah. Not here, but yeah. I think let's leave. - Here, in case you get bored. You know what, I'll just hang onto it. - Okay. I'll meet you in the lobby. - Cool, I'll just be a minute. He's cute. Ish. This is the last time I date anybody from a frickin' app. Oh, my God. But what is up with that stupid accent. I do not why people are into that. I mean, "I'll wait for you in the lobby, "would you like some popcorn?" Just stop complaining. Think of Trench. Ready. - I've got good news, and I've got bad news. - Okay, can you tell me outside? I have to get going. - I should probably tell you the bad news, then. We're locked in. - Yeah, right. - No, unfortunately, we are. I've tried every door. But it's not working, so. - Are you serious? This isn't funny. It's not romantic, either. - Look, I don't wanna be here just as much as you don't. - Who even still goes to the movies on a first date? Is that even a thing? A dating tip from your grandma, or something? - No, she passed away before she could give me any tips. Jesus. Well, the good news is, eventually they'll let us out. We might as well grab a drink, have some gourmet food. Security cameras will pick us up, and someone will find us. Dinner's ready. So, on tonight's menu, we have two gourmet hot dogs, with a ketchup and mustard blend, with poorly chopped onions. And for desert, you're gonna like this, an assortment of chocolate bars. - Alex, this isn't funny. I need to get back to work. - Work? Who goes on a date before the night shift. Really? For the appetizer, I was thinking, you know, popcorn cup. But as you know, no popcorn after 10, so. - Make some. - It is a bit messy. - Hm, first. - Really? Okay, yeah, yeah, sure. Jean Raffanier, 2000 and something. Good year. - Classy. - Yeah. - Now, I'm a little hungry. - Good. - Well, I assume my cooking isn't that bad. - Do you cook, except for, you know? - Now and then. - Don't ask. I know, I have a microwave, so why would I? - Your health. - Let's not even go there. I love all things gluten, sugar, palm oil and Nutella, caffeine and dairy. - Well, add a bottle of red wine, and I'd consider another date. - So, when did your grandma pass away? - Like 22 years. 22 years. - Years? You made it sound like it was yesterday. What is wrong with you? - I know how to calm people down, don't I? - You psycho. How 'bout that popcorn? - Hey, hey, hey, hey. You can't keep pushing buttons and expecting popcorn. It takes finesse. No, leave it. We need three tablespoons of popcorn oil, otherwise it'll burn. - How do you know so much about making popcorn, nerd? - My parents had a popcorn machine when I was growing up. Assuming that the universal law of popcorn-making still applies. - Do you get to see your parents often? - Not as much as I'd like. Wanna try? - How hard can it be? No one ever burns popcorn, right? - Take this in here. - All right. - Right. Two scoops. Just don't make it messy. There we go, that's it. - Oops. A little clumsy. Relax, it's not like we have to clean it up. - There we go. There we go. Okay. For your safety. - Thank you. Now we wait? - Yep. Suspense. It's actually a science, really, making popcorn - Is it? - Yeah. - Wow. - It's an art. Very cool. Pop art. Pop art. - That's it. That's it. So then, you just dump it all in. - Well, look at that. - There we go. - We made popcorn. - We did. - Ah, thank you. - No problem. Nice and clean, there we go. Can you pass me a cup, please? - Yeah. - Oh, there we go. Thank you. - Sure. Ow. Could you not do that, please? Please don't do that. Really? Ooo, sorry. Oh, my bad. Ooo, sorry, beg your pardon. - Oh, whoops. My bad. - Come on, come on. - Oh, got it in the eye. - How you like me now? Oh, oh. - Oh, he means it. - Here we go, go on, hide. Can't hide from me forever. - Watch me try. - Oh, it's coming raining. - Oh. - It's raining. - Okay, all right, relax, relax. - Bam. - Oh. Wow. A gentleman, I see. - Wow. - Do you think we'll ever get out of here? - Why, you got somewhere to be tomorrow? - Yeah. Wow, made a mess. And no help. I need a piece of paper. - Okay. Here we go. - Great. - I can't read what that says, and I'm two feet away. I don't think security's gonna read that. Plus, if anyone was here, we'd be kicked out. - You got a better idea, smartypants? - Well, there must be a spare set of keys somewhere. - You look on your side, I'll look on mine. Boom. My way. Is that supposed to be a clue? - Well, let's try and see. - Yeah, right. That's when we split up in the dark, and then one of us gets savagely murdered, probably me. Thank you very much, but I am staying right here, in front of the cameras. - Oh. Miss Concerto chickens out. Don't be a baby. Look, it's better than, what, just staying here? - Okay, will you hold on? - Finally. I'm coming. - Come on. - Okay. It's kind of exciting. - Ah ha. Yes. - Wow, you really know how to entertain a girl on a first date I warn you, if anything or anyone pops out, I'm on their side, not yours. Why do you think it says my way, dot dot dot? - I don't know. They must be a fan of Sinatra. - Right. Fly Me to the Moon. - Or Come Fly with Me. - So cheesy. Oh. Sorry, that's probably something stupid. - Yeah. Oh yeah, just go ahead. - Oh, Jesus. - Oh. All clear. Thought I saw something. - Such a freak. What was I thinking? Only weirdos have online dates. - Oh come on, silly, we can share online dating stories later. - Hmm. - All right. Hm. You need a code? - Huh, weird. I mean, it looks like it. - Hm, well, find it. - Fine, I will. Hm. Well, it's not up here. - Here? Let's find out. Hm. Don't tell me you've never been locked in a theater before. Oh, come on. You've never been to an escape room? - Escape what? - Room. You pay $100, they lock you in a staged room, and you solve a bunch of clues, and escape. It's pretty cool. - Why would I pay to be locked inside a room? - Isn't that what you did tonight? - Smart ass. Come on, whenever you're ready, Macgyver. - Six time seven? - Numbers not your thing? - Okay, I have discount-chulia, it's a disease. So, I would I appreciate it if you wouldn't be so sarcastic. Thank you. 42. - Times eight? - 336. - Times five. - Really? - Mmhmm. - Times five. 1480, no, no, 1680. Wow. Really? - Uh-huh. - That's pretty good. I'm impressed. - Mmhmm. All right. - Oh. Got a short here. - Short film. - That's what it looks like. - Are you trying to kill me? - No. No, shorts are boring. - Actually, incorrect. Boogie Nights would not be Boogie Nights if it didn't have the short start, so. - Touchy. - It's about to start. We got 30 seconds, come on. Go, go, go. Key. - Boogie Nights, really? That's all you got? I swear, you're killing me with this right now. - But do you have a better idea? - It's starting. - Is that the guy from Big? - You know, we don't need to whisper. We're alone in here, so. Talk normally. - Thank you. - Unless Jerry's here. - I never saw that guy. She was bonkers, wasn't she? Zoltar's doing a good job, yeah. - Is it just me, or does he kind of look like Tom Hanks? - Who, Zoltar? - No, the big guy. Yeah, I can see it. - 'Cause he's giving me a vibe. - Yeah, it's a show, actually, it's a good observation. Kinda like boy-ish charm. - She's like, quality. - Yeah yeah, no, I get it. - Exactly. - Ruggedly handsome. Is that how you'd describe Tom Hanks? More like straight man, actually, more like, you know. Yeah. Yeah. You're right, he is the guy from Big. Yeah, he is, yeah. He was great in Riding in Cars with Boys. Did you see that? No. - It's a good movie. I studied at the university. - Oh yeah? - Yeah. - Studied Riding in Cars with Boys? - It's a great movie, okay? Drew Barrymore's tour de force. Should have won an Oscar, Steve Zahn's wonderful. You probably know the movie he was in called Honey. - Missed that one. - It's a classic, it's a dance movie classic. Dance movie classic? - Yeah, that's right. Jessica Alba plays a street dancer named Honey. Gets into some bad problems. - I do love me some Jessica Alba. - Exactly. - Who doesn't? - Who doesn't? - Apparently we agree on that. - Good. Ooo, what's this? She is pissed. Well, wouldn't you, if someone took your chair? Obviously she's got a dodgy knee or hip. She didn't take her chair, there are other chairs. Yes, but it's obvious she's an elderly lady, who needs some sort of assistance. What's happening, what's that? I don't know. It looks like she just hit her there. It's about young people responding not well to the elderly ideologies of what has come from the past. That seems like a stretch. But then, she's blocking her now, so she's also not helping. You're agreeing. Just booted her out. Well, we need to work together. That's the whole point. - No, you're. - Tete-a-tete, you know? Tete-a-tete? See, he's gonna let her win this one. Oh. Is this gonna be a whole movie about tic-tac-toe? Would you let me win? Not a chance. Good to know, thanks. What's your type? - Tom Hanks. - Right, that's good. - What were you looking for? - I don't know, something flattering. - Colin Firth? Hugh Grant? - Yeah, there we go, that's okay. Hugh Grant, yeah, a little less foppish. - Foppish, what is foppish? - Just, you know, a bit foppy. - That doesn't explain it. You can't use the word in the definition. It's not actually a thing. - Okay, fine. Foppish, to be fop, slightly dandy, but sort of pathetic, you could say. - Slightly dandy? - Dandy. - What's dandy? - Sorry, we found the language, not you. Now, let's get back to the game. Ostentatious. Ooo. - Do you know what that means? - Yeah. Do you? - Yes. - Cool, I'm glad we both know. - Good, okay. The ability to attract attention to oneself. Ostentatious. - Oh, so you've been familiar with that word for a long time. - Hmm. So, she almost gave him her number. See, she's got the hat, she gets it. It's the same dress as the seven year old, the pigtails. Oh. - Oh. No. She's cramping his style. Yeah, I know what that's like. I don't know if I get it. You're not meant to get it. Me personally, or everyone? - No, just in general, you're just not meant to get it. That's the whole point of it, it makes you ask questions. There's no answers. It's like a bad episode of Lost. Actually no, it's like every episode of Lost. - I haven't seen Lost either. - Don't bother. - I don't have a TV. - I lost three years of my life to it. - 10 minutes of tic-tac-toe. Some writers definitely lack imagination. - But it's not about tic-tac-toe. It's a modern vision of the sprayed sprinkler. - Oh, of course, right. You're a writer wannabe, right? - Thanks for the wannabe. - Sorry, I mean a writer soon-to-be, is that better? Okay, so, if we were to write this, wouldn't you want to be more universal, talk about the big picture? - You work in a book store, right? - I'm a literary specialist. - Okay. Well, you should try and write yourself. And then you can judge. - Wow, okay. So, we're gonna elude this topic. Remind me not to debate with you again, you really go for the jugular. - Whoa, whoa, what were you writing on the notepad? - Oh, I don't know, just notes. That they might be useful. So. What brought you to LA? Wanted to be an actor? - Oh, God no. Much worse. I followed a girl who wanted to be an actress. - Oh. What happened. - Well, she followed a guy who will make her into an actress. - Oh, do I know her? - Maybe. Are you familiar with the Starbucks on 4th and Highland? She makes the best frappuccinos. - What's your story? - Oh, I moved here to go to law school. And? - Well, I decided that my life was worth more than just being a lawyer, so I dropped out. - Not as glamorous as Legally Blonde? - No. I actually created my own handmade custom t-shirt company. You contact me on my website, pitch me your idea, I design it, send you back three options, you pick, and for $29.99, you get it in your mailbox within 14 days, and you pride yourself on quality materials and outstanding customer service. - Wow. - Hey, come on, give it back to me, please. - I just wanted you to play something. - It's not tuned. - Well, we can tune it. - No. - But you're wearing a yes t-shirt. - What, you speak French now. - Of course. I'll give it back to you in a minute. - Alex. You're meant to be a product. Meant to be a player? Come on, seriously. - Yeah, a player. - Okay, okay, okay. - Come on. - I'll give it back. - Thank you, come on. - I'm gonna give it back. Here you go. - Thank you. - Wow. I always thought a violin was a string instrument, not a woodwind. Are you in an air guitar band? 'Cause that makes a lot of sense. - It was a prop at my old job, okay? A prop? - I thought it would look cool. - I don't understand. - Listen. I have no special skills. I'm 28, and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life. I print t-shirts in my free time, and I pretend to know everything about literature, even though I barely read Alice in Wonderland as a kid. - What do you mean, you barely read Alice in Wonderland? - Like, I mostly read it, but. - What about Animal Farm. - Mmm mmm. - You must have read The Hobbit. - No. - The Harry Potter series? - I missed it. The Goosebumps anthology. - Okay, that's a guy's series. Girls don't read that. - Okay, Sweet Valley High. The Babysitter's Club. The Bible? What about Tom Sawyer? - I read Tom Sawyer. There we go. - 'Kay, I saw the cartoon, but. - No that's, well, at least it's the same story, but you didn't really put the work into it. - Mmhmm, yeah. - Did you use the violin to impress me? It worked. Mission accomplished. Look, honest. Mission accomplished. - Stop, in the name of the law. Dumb Pull. - Did you hear that? - No. - Come on, the footsteps. I swear I heard something. - So, why choose the violin? Did you steal it from an old granny, or something? - I told you, it was a prop at my old job. And it looks cute. - You're such a hipster. Was this at the bookstore? - No, actually, I used to work at an escape room. - Have you ever seen a taser that you couldn't handle? Broke it. Yeah, that was so sweet. Oh, my gosh, that was so sweet. Okay. It is time to get the bad guys. - Where are you going? - Don't worry, I'll be back in a minute. Go back to sleep. - Don't leave without me. Promise. - Promise. Come on, Taryn. Take off your earbuds and answer the phone. - Who's there? - Your brother, popcorn freak. What was that about? - I don't know, I just thought you should be healthy. How's it going? Actually, very well. We just finished the short. - Did she like it? - She doesn't understand art. - Yeah, right. Good thing you didn't show her the little guys on the traffic light, or whatever the fuck that shit is. - Yeah, yeah, well one day, you'll thank me for being part of my adventures. Yeah, doubtful. - Anyway, look, I need a couple of hours, so. - Oh, come on. I have a life. - Please. Look, I'll make it up to you. Promise. - Is she even worth it? - She was. I mean, she is. I mean, she could be. I think she's overall pretty clutch. - Clutch, that's so romantic. Thank you. - Always a pleasure. - Oh, oh, and remember to tell Escott, yeah? - Shit. Pick up. Voicemail? Useless. Pay him to sit in his chair and watch the monitor. And answer the phones. Oh, my God. Mmm. - Hey. You don't move, you don't speak, and you do exactly what I say. Escott-- - What did I just say, no talking. Now, put your hands up, or I tase you. Up, up, up, up, up, up, up. Oh, a bottle of wine and some chocolate bars, and oh, my favorite, Twizzlers. That sounds like jail time to me. - Escott. - Listen, if you say one more word, I am gonna stick a charge into you like you wouldn't believe. Wait, how do you know my name? - And now the penny drops. What the fuck, Escott? - Oh, mt God. I'm so sorry, I never, the thing just went off, and I didn't know that that was you. - I was sitting behind you. No, but I thought you left. But Taryn told you I was staying here tonight. - No, no, no, no, Mr. Porter, she did not, I promise. - She said that I was gonna be staying here for a couple more hours. No, no, not tonight, she didn't. Oh, God Taryn. So, how long have you had this toy for? - Well, since last week. It makes me feel safer. - Yeah? Maybe you could do a little bit more practice. - Yeah, well, I know, but it's really hard to practice, and I didn't know that it was gonna be so fast, and if it makes you feel any better, you were my first. - Great. Great, okay. Listen to me, Escott. Yes, Mr. Porter? - You can leave, but you must lock the doors before you go. - Right, okay, yes. - Don't worry about security. I've got your back. But Escott? Quiet. - Got it. - Okay? - Quiet. - Good. - Yes. - Have these. - Thank you. I get to keep the taser, right? - Yes, you can keep the taser. - Yes. - Just keep it away from me. - Got it. - Quiet. - Quiet. - And now. - Perfect. Okay. - You were gone a while. - You already can't be without me. - I may have missed you a little. - I brought more supplies. - Ah, wine. I need wine. - I bet you do, Sue Ellen. More red wine. Oh, make yourself at home. - Mmhmm. Just getting more comfortable. We might be here a while. Wow, you don't need to get me drunk. - I'm sorry. I think I'm in the wrong theater, I was looking for Zoe. - Hmm. You know, I'm really, really tired. - Then you should go to bed. - Mmm. But, when I'm tired, I get very, very horny. - Well, maybe I can help with that. - Hmm, I'm sure you would be very, very helpful. Do you think we'll ever get out of here? - Hopefully not. I mean, we have wine, we have food, and I have you. Sounds like paradise. - Yeah. That sounds marvelous. But, if that's so, then maybe, we could have Escott join us. Wouldn't that be fun? I mean, the more, the merrier. - Escott, what? - What was the rest of the plan? You take advantage of me, and then, you suddenly find the key somewhere? - No, listen to me, listen. - Hey, no, you listen to me. I have been listening to your bullshit all night. How many ladies have had the privilege of being stuck in this shit hole? - It's not like that. - Yeah, right, okay, you know what? If I ever hear from you, see you, or even smell you again, I swear to you, I will, chop your balls off. ¶ You say that you change, ¶ ¶ That you were a better man ¶ ¶ But I've heard it all ¶ ¶ What have took me for ¶ - Ah, some popcorn, or, whoa, calm yourself, woman. I knew something was wrong with that chick. ¶ Oh no ¶ ¶ You're not the one I need ¶ ¶ And you're not the everything ¶ ¶ Oh ¶ ¶ Oh no ¶ - I'm sorry. - Eh, it was coming. I can't believe she was the only one that thought my film was not good enough. Fine, apart from you, Roger Ebert. - What the hell did you guys do? - She did have a different way of thinking. - Well, it looks like she knows how to have fun. - Oh yeah, I'm sorry, I'll clean up. - Miss Taryn, you really should have called me. - Thanks for the heads up. - Yeah, no problem. - Did you guys know the cacklet sleeps standing up. They dive down to grab snatches of sleep that last about 12 minutes, and then they slowly drift to the surface. Head first. - Wow. - Yeah. - That's fascinating. - Mmhmm. - I'm gonna get some sleep. I think you guys should, too. If you want to do it standing up, sitting down, or lying on the couch, I'm out. - Wait. I'll give you a ride. - Yeah. Okay guys, I'll lock up. 18th hole. Augusta National. For the masters. Get in your hole. Let's go for a new personal record of 403 in a row. Oh, that's short. Gosh. Okay. I think it's the ball. I had a personal record going, and then, I just go, and I screw it up. And now, I'm back at it. And that is what you call a victory dance. - Thanks a lot, enjoy your night. - Bye. - So, how many people. - Four, plus two, plus three, plus four, so-- - 13. - 13. - We need to do something. We can't carry on the way it is. - Maybe I have an idea. - Okay. Do tell. - Okay, you can't compete with the multiplex. So, why don't we do something different. - Right. Your plan does have a stage two, right? - Do a themed theater. - A themed theater? - Okay. So, today we had 13 customers. $10, that's, - 130. - Smart ass. So, what if we have five screenings a day, but only two customers per screening? Now, you're thinking, that's less than now. But no, not if we charge $50 per customer. Why 50? Because the price of the movie date experience. - Okay, continue, go on. - All right, so, for two hours, the theater is theirs, entirely theirs. No employees, no popcorn girl, no projectionist. They have entry, and then the whole place to themselves. Basically, it's home at the theater, or theater at home. The first DIY theater. - That's great. No, that is an unbelievable idea. I could kiss you. - Don't kiss me. - No, I'm not going to, but that's still a great idea. - And last but not least, we can supervise from the security room, so if they have any issues, we can interact with them from there, just like in an escape room. - What is it with you girls and escape rooms? - Hm? - Nothing. No, I really like this. This is great. Okay, let's start it tomorrow morning, 8:00 a.m. - I'm sorry, eight? - Well, great entrepreneurs wake up early. It's a compliment. You'll get used to it, relax. - I should have kept my mouth shut. Yo, the towel, you're bringing it home? - Yeah, it's a white flag. - He just took a left. Deli meat, eight letters. What have you got? - Salt beef. What? - Salt beef. - Salt beef, that isn't a thing. - It is a thing. It's a deli. Good evening, welcome, how you doing tonight? - How the hell wrote a movie about this stupid game? - Great choice. - In a world of war and injustice, Bruce has found a way to bring back peace on earth. Tic-tac-toe toe toe toe. - You know, I was thinking, T, you should apply for a job at Disney Land. I mean, your be much valued over there. - Honey. - Was salt beef right? - Salt beef isn't a thing. - It is a thing. You have it on rye bread. It's taking you this long. - Hello. Anybody here? It's your lucky day. You have a customer trying to buy a book. - Yes, yes, coming. Hi, I'm here, how can I help you? - Back there, like, working out? - Long story. So, what is it you're looking for? - It's a gift. Something readable. Yeah, readable is a good start. Fun, but dramatic at the same time. I don't know, something new. - Hm. How 'bout US Weekly? - Oh, she's funny, too. - Wait a minute, you look familiar. You're the popcorn freak. - Guilty. Okay, but just listen to me for a second. - Look, I don't have time for this. I have work to do. - No, it'll just take a minute, I promise. All your customers can wait. - It's the holidays, people buy food, not books. - Oh, of course, it's the holidays. All right, so Alex has this new concept at the theater. It was actually my idea. I am the brains, after all. But you would like it, so you should come by. - Look, popcorn. - Taryn. - Look, Popcorn Taryn, I know in a romcom, that would be the perfect time for me to start missing Alex, having remorse and run to him, but-- - Hm, she's an expert of the cinema, too. - I know my classics. But the fact is, I'm really over him, if I was ever into him in the first place. So, I appreciate the thought, but I think I'll pass. - You guys are both so stubborn. - Look, I have to get back to working out. - Be careful carrying on like that. I might start to like you soon. If you ever change your mind, text me. Don't call me, speaking on the phone gives me anxiety. - Looks like you're gonna need more time to find the right book. - No, you're right. I'll stick with US Weekly. - Bye. Let's go out, meet fresh meat. No, I can't go, I have work tomorrow. Come on, where's the stool? - Yeah, I know. Seriously, no one will notice, it's dead empty. Anyway, what's the plan for Halloween? - Of course, I'm not doing anything for Halloween. A costume. - Nope, not negotiable. - Boring. - Yeah, I know. Well, I guess I'm just gonna sit here and stare at my cat. - Okay. I have a pile of t-shirts to finish up. You can come help me instead. Halloween's overrated. Get yourself a boyfriend to help. - A boyfriend? Yeah, right. - Netflix and-- - I do not not have Netflix. I do not wanna chill. - Hey, they're not all twats like Alex. I mean, they almost all are. - Hey. I gotta go, Thai food's waiting. Okay, enjoy ironing. - Okay. Bye bye. - Bye. ¶ I want to walk with you in moonlight ¶ ¶ And I know you're not in heaven ¶ ¶ Go on and pretending ¶ ¶ That I really thought this ¶ ¶ Oh, when you're with me, darling, ¶ ¶ You mean more to me than anyone else ¶ ¶ I'm so confused by you ¶ ¶ I don't know what to do ¶ - What time are they coming? - The first couple are coming at six, then we have 30 minute break. Second one comes at nine. - That's exciting. - Yeah. - Is the security room ready? - All ready. - All right. Everything's fine. Let's go get a beer, we have an hour. - We have beer here, I don't need a beer - Well, let's go get some fresh air. - T, I was thinking, when are you gonna get a proper job? - I could never stop working with you. - You can't really call it work. - Let's go. - Fine, okay. Just for an hour, though. Can't be late. Taryn, what are we doing now? - Please, it'll just take a minute. - I don't think they sell gossip magazines here. - Don't start. Hello, your favorite customer is here. - Oh, you again. - Ah. - Look, if you need a copy of Harry Potter, even signed by JK Rowling, maybe I can help you. But if you're here to talk about him, I think we're done. - Oh, I promise, I'm not gonna talk about Alex, but, yeah. - What the hell, Popcorn? - Taryn, it's Taryn. - Yeah, what the hell, Popcorn. - You don't start. We're all here because of you. - Me? I didn't ask to be here. - Yeah, right. - I've got much better things to do. - Mmhmm. - This is going well. - So, why are you here? To apologize, to beg me to give you a second chance? Tell me how much you love me? Why? - No, I'm here because I got tricked. - Oh, another of your little games? - No, Taryn said we were grabbing a drink to relax, and instead, she brought me here. - Oh, like a date? Have you ever thought of dating her? You two would make a great couple. Kant. - I don't really think that's legal here. My sister. Sister? - Well, half-sister. Same dad. He passed away three years ago before we inherited the theater. - Wait, so that's your theater? - Yeah, all mine. Mine and Taryn's. We have a new concept, so I really need to get going, so. - New concept? - Yeah. You seen Taryn anywhere? No. - Taryn? You have keys, right? - Oh, shit. - I really don't have time for this. Taryn. Taryn. I took her keys. - Taryn, what the hell? - Yeah, what the hell? - Oh, calm down. Get back to work, guys, figure out more clues. All you've done is put up cameras and shitty instructions on how to make popcorn. Tell me you got a plan. - She's probably right. - Look, I'm not gonna tell you again. Let me out, come on. - You said she was the queen of escape rooms. Figure it out, and I'll open the door. Whatever. - No, no, no. Okay, hey, maybe you can help, okay? Remember our little adventure at the theater? - Do I remember? - Okay, poor choice of phrasing, fair play. Well, it inspired me. - I'm listening. - You guys love your dating adventures in this country. - Dating adventures? - Yeah, you know about dating, it's not about who you're with, it's about having fun on the date. - So cliche. - Well, I made a new adventure. - What, you're selling your services at the theater now? - Ha ha, very funny. No, it's a dating concept. A couple come to the theater, and they get locked in for a couple of hours. - What, an escape room? - Exactly. - That's my idea. - God, it is crazy in this city how many people think it's always their idea. - Right, my idea. - Ah, nice t-shirt. Anyway, we have our first customers in a couple of hours. And if I'm not there, my idea-- Hey, I can hear you. - Taryn's idea, okay, your idea, whatever, it'll be gone. - You had the popcorn figured out. - Yeah, but we need a puzzle or something, a more mysterious element to it. - What about the projector, how hard is it to load a film? - Pretty easy. I mean, even Taryn can do it. - Okay, okay. - Sometime today, please. - What about the projection booth? We needed a code to get in there, right? Come on. - Maybe we can hide the code somewhere? I don't think the answer's gonna be in a book. - Tah-dah. - Great, now she thinks she's Houdini.- - Open it. The cards are numbered, two through 10, with four suits. Right? - Zoe, it's now not really the time for strip poker. - Two through 10 can be our base numbers. Jacks, queens, kings, and aces are mathematical symbols, and the equation can be laid out in sequence of suit. We just need to come up with another equation that equals 1680. - Sure. - And the cards can be taped to the bottom of the chairs in the theater, and it'll be like a scavenger hunt, too. And the seat number on the ticket can be the first clue of the scavenger hunt. - Yeah, yeah, perfect. Right, yeah? Okay, good. Let's go, come. - Hey, we have your idea, open up. - Yes, great. Okay. Where is she? - No idea. - Well, we don't have time. Come on. - No, I'm going to call her. - No, no, no, Alex, come one. No, let's just take this. - Yeah, I'm not gettin' on that, thanks. Look she's gonna answer, I promise you, I swear. - Can you ride a bike? - Yeah, I can ride a bike, it's just, I haven't in a long time. - You can't. Oh, this is so good. Okay. - It's ringing, it's ringing. - Alex, just get on the back. - She's gonna answer. - You know you don't have time to wait, she's not answering. - No, it takes her a while. - We don't have that much time. Do you want to be late? Come on. - It's still ringing, she's gonna answer the phone. - Oh man, you are scared, you are scared. - I'm not scared. - Yeah, you are. It's fine, you're scared. - There you go. - Will you get on? - I'm getting on. - All right, here we go. - Okay. Whoa, okay. You'll be fine. This is really not fun. We're gonna make it, don't worry. Oh, the bike doesn't sound too healthy. I'm too scared to look down at my watch, but I really shouldn't have enough time. We're running late - We're fine, we're going as fast as we can. Do you wanna drive? No, I really don't wanna drive. - How much do you weigh? - I don't weigh that much. That was my knee. - Stop complaining. - Okay, here we go, nice and easy. - Ooo, I know a shortcut. - What? Oh, my God, it's going so fast. Tree. Okay, anywhere around here, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop. Okay. - Got it. How you doing? - Yeah, great. Never again. That's why I don't get on bikes. You're welcome, by the way. Yes, for hurting me. - Hey, slow down. - Now's really not the time to slow down. This is it. - Okay. - Four, five, six. - Ah. Looks familiar. - Yeah, just like the good old days, huh? - Mmhmm. - So, who's this mystery couple? - Actually it's a friend, I guess. - Oh, first date? - Yeah, we've been with her talking for ages. - Mmm. Who'd put their faith in you? - I mean, it's obviously working. - Mr. Porter? Miss. - Is that? - Yes, it is. - Oh, you look handsome. - Thank you, Miss. - Zoe. - Zoe. - So, who's the lucky lady? - Oh, just someone from my old work. From my corporate days. - Oh, that's exciting. - I'm a little nervous. - Oh, don't worry, it can't go worse than it did with me. - Thanks, just standing here. Escott, everything's gonna be fine. I made it very easy. Just remember, be a gentleman, and treat her like a lady. - Got it. - Wow. I wish you would have applied some of that good advice to yourself. Oh, burn. Yeah, like do what I say, not what I do? That's what I should listen to. Right? - Yeah. - Right, be a gentleman, be a lady. Treat her like a lady. Yes, got it, thank you, Mr. Porter. Zoe. - Well, okay, chop chop, she's waiting for you. - Oh. - Escott. No weapons tonight. - Oh, no, no, I returned the taser. It is way too dangerous. - Yeah. - I got an Airsoft pistol instead, so I can stay protected on the job, and do paintball in my free time. Double whammy. - This should be interesting. - Yeah, very interesting. Okay. - Let's go. - Yeah, we should go. Yeah, yeah, we should go, okay. - Good luck tonight. - Thank you, Miss Zoe. - So the trick is to take the suction cup. - Mmhmm. There we go. Hold the letter, and then, place it where you want it to go, just like that. And then, the trick is, with a little twist of your wrist, lift the letter off the suction cup. - Yeah, it looks easy. Here, give me the stick. - You sure? - Yeah. - There you go. - So you-- - Take it there. - Grab the letter. Okay, got it. - That's it, that's it. - And then, - And then hopefully place it. - Like that? - Yeah, yeah. - It's not sticking. - That's it, no, no. - Just finesse, just with the wrist. - Like that? - Like a slight turn here, just a slight turn. - Perfect. Could have done it myself, you know. - Yes, you could have, for sure. - We should get going, she'll be here soon. - Yeah. - No, no, no, this can't be happening. - Oh. - Can't be happening. - Looking for this? - How? - You know, Escott is a really great guy, but he is a terrible security guard. - You're amazing. Come, come on. - Okay. Okay, here we go. - Okay. - Yeah. - Here we are, in the theater. - The theater. - So, we're looking for 15, 14. - Oh. - Oh, after you. - Oh, well, thank you. - Yeah, okay. What does the next card say? - A movie you want to see, jack and queen you got to be. - A movie you want to see, jack and queen you got to be. - Exclamation point. - Exclamation point. - Mmhmm. - It's never gonna work. Jack and queen you got to be. - Who thought up of this crazy idea, anyway? - Oh, my new boss. Yeah, he's a very great man. Very wise and gentle. I mean, not gentle, per se. - What is he even talking about. - Oh, yeah. And you're happier here than when you were sitting behind the desk? - Oh. - That is true, yeah, I confess. And then, - Yeah. - Yeah. - Well, your new boss is very creative. - Okay, maybe it wasn't the best idea, but, you know, I'm just a literary specialist. - I told you. Maybe we should give him a hint or something? - And I caught him when he was trying this whole thing out with Miss Zoe the firs time. So, like, oops, my bad. - Really? - Yeah. - Wow, so, you're telling me, that if we're here tonight, it's a little bit because of you. - We could definitely say that. It's a little bit because of me. - Well, back to work. - Right. - Yeah. - Okay, I don't know where. - Wait. - Oh. Jackpot. - Oh. - Oh, yeah. - What? - The name is Scott. Escott. - Boom. - I can't believe it. - So, Escott. - Okay. - What do we do with these cards now? - I don't know. Jack of spades, queen of hearts, ace of diamonds. - Hey, what movie are we gonna see tonight, anyway? - Oh no, I can't say that, it's a secret. - Come on. - No. - Come on, am I gonna like it? - Well, okay, it's this wonderful movie. It's about an elder man who starts a new job, and he - Falls for the massage therapist? - I love that movie. - Yeah. - When do we actually see it? - I dunno. It's kind of a new concept. Maybe they're working out the kinks. - Why have they stopped? - I dunno, maybe they're stuck? - Jack of spades, queen of hearts, ace of diamonds. Wait a minute. Look. Your under seat. Oh. Under your seat. So. - Oh. Oh. - You're a genius. No, honestly, that's amazing. - You know, people are pretty intelligent, if you give them the benefit of the doubt. Don't worry, you'll get there someday, if you work at it. Thank you. So, what's next? - Well, the movie is about an hour and a half. So, that gives you some time to surprise me. - Do you think they forgot about us? - Now, that's good popcorn. - Oh, it's always better when you make it yourself. - You know, I'm actually not this easy. - Yeah, right. - No, no, to be honest, I actually wanted to show you my new film. - Please, don't. - No, it's really good, I promise you. It's about the guys who live in the dope walk. You know, traffic lights. - Mmhmm. - The big bread hand, and his friend, the little white guy. Oh, do you what you want. - No more festival films. - Not even at least one a month? - Year. - Year? I'm a film connoisseur. It's my work. - We're ready, okay. You can start the movie now. Thanks. And now, for our feature presentation. Go low, deep voice, manly. - Now that you have this new concept, you'll probably need a project manager. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Do you have any ideas? - I know a girl. - Okay. - And her first mission as project manager, is to pick a better film. - Oh. Yeah, yeah. I actually watched one the other day, it's really good. The Girl with the Invisible Violin. - Oh, really? - Really good. - Missed that one. - You should see it. Yeah, it has a really strong female lead. - She sounds great. - Yeah, very great. Lot of depth, lot of conviction. - Mmm. - Her violin playing, a little left to be desired. But, you know. - I'll have to see it. - Yeah. It's great. - Sounds like my kind of film. - I think you'd like it. Super charming. - Witty? - Very. - Hilarious, probably. - A laugh aloud caper. I love a bit of fake violins. Who doesn't, really? Fake Yo-Yo Ma. Sounds quirky. Fake Bach. Fun. Fake Mozart. Charming. Know any other violinists?
