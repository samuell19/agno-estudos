Spanning 10 seasons, with over 200 episodes... ...Stargate SG-1 has traveled to countless planets... ...encountered different races, and met numerous aliens... ...some friend and some foe. They worked tirelessly to use whatever means necessary... ...to acquire technology that could help Earth... ...in its battle against unforeseen aggressors. But one of the biggest reasons for Stargate SG-1 's success... ...has been the way that Earth-based mythology... ...has been woven into the show's fabric. "Woven" is a fantastic way of putting it, Michael. In over 10 seasons, the show has always found an entertaining way... ...to put a Stargate twist on the mythology. Join us as we take you deep into 10 years of Stargate SG-1 mythology. And don't worry, we'll sort it all out for you by the end of this show. We hope. We hope. If mythology is defined as a set of stories, traditions, or beliefs... ...associated with a particular group... ...arising naturally or deliberately fostered... ...then the writers of Stargate SG-1 were doing everything possible... ...to create a deep and layered mythology... ...that Stargate could call its own. Make no mistake. Osiris will return... ...and the rivers of the Earth will run red with blood. JUDGE: I think the role that mythology has played... ...on the show has obviously been a very important one. I mean, from the genesis of the series, it was based in Egyptian mythology. This is just incredible. JUDGE: You know, being the cradle of civilization... ...we often wonder the hows and the whys... ...and this gave, at least a sci-fi perspective... ...of what could have, maybe, possibly happened back in those ancient times. DANIEL: Jack, I think that this is a map... ...of a vast network of stargates. Stargates that are all over the galaxy. WOMAN: The stargate's a key mythological element in the show... ...because it fits into a number of mythological systems: The Egyptian, the Celtic, the Norse, which are three major systems... ...that operate in the show, all have references to bridges, for example... ...that traverse one world to the next. The stargate is a means of seeding all of the planets... ...with different mythology. As a narrative device it works perfectly. You know, I think people love to see... ...you know, stories that they're familiar with. You know, mythological stories, things that they've heard before... ...explained with a Stargate twist. SHANKS: I think that's one of the best things about Stargate. It's one of the first things that attracted me to the film... ...was the concept of-- The idea that certain myths or questions, the great wonders of the world... ...or different relics, like the pyramids, that are left behind... ...are yet to be really properly explained... ...and everybody's got some highfalutin theory. What's great about science fiction and asking "what if?"... ...is that we can put our own spin on that... ...because we have artistic license to do whatever we want. That's the wonderful thing about Stargate... ...is we've been able to not only borrow from the Egyptians... ...the Greeks and the Romans and now Arthurian mythologies... ...we're actually able to conjure up, with our imagination, some ideas that-- The speculation in ideas that other people have toyed with... ...because there are no right answers. So we can create something, and it makes... ...as opposed to making people escape, it makes them kind of think and go: "That might be true," or "That's not true." The parchment told us five virtues would guide us on our quest for the Sangraal. Prudence, kindness, charity, wisdom and faith. Now, we displayed prudence in finding a way out of the temporal maze... ...charity in escaping the force field trap, kindness by helping the child... ...and finding the hidden passageway, and wisdom in solving the riddles. The only virtue left is faith. - Daniel. - Jackson. Mythologies are designed to give us a sense of how we fit into the universe. They ask where we're coming from and where we're going. So where are you from? Where we come from and where we are going are all the same. Oh, I get you. Wherever you go, there you are. And what we see when we look at mythological systems... ...and what our intrepid heroes, SG-1, see when they look out at the galaxy... ...in the vast panoply of characters that they meet there... ...is really yourself. Everywhere you go, there you are. And that's one of the reasons Stargate works so well... ...is because it does have this hook into ancient mythologies... ...and a lot of fans are fascinated with the whole idea... ...of the ancient mythologies... ...because they use it as a sort of scientific explanation... ...for things that can't really be explained otherwise. There's a legend around here about a Hall of Thor's Might. Daniel, there's a time and place for mythology. CARTER: With all due respect, sir... ...we thought Thor's hammer was a myth until we proved it was real. In fact, Stargate is something that you might call cultural bricolage. It's a way of going through all of human culture... ...and picking up little bits and pieces and sticking them together. But sticking them together using the stargate as a glue. And making it into a really, really interesting story. There's a rule for mythology, in terms of heroes, I know that. But it's also a good rule on television. You can pair off-- We're gonna split up. I' m with Teal'c. Wait up. WRIGHT: And you can cover a good dynamic of different kinds of hero. You've got your military person in Jack O' Neill. And, later on, in Mitchell. Whoa, whoa, whoa! Man! Bullets bounce. And you've got your warrior in Teal'c. You have Daniel Jackson as an intellectual and scientist. Unless we wanna get a really bad reputation, I think we should avoid... ...shooting the first people we meet on a new planet. And then Sam... ...possibly the hardest character to have to try to portray. She's almost all of them. She is the warrior. She is the thinker. When the local sun sets and it gets dark... ...you can actually see a luminous layer of ionized gas... ...around the dying core expanding. Fascinating. And, of course, a woman. Boy, she had a lot on her plate. And she can pull it off. It's amazing. How good is this? Got the band back together. Yeah, so what's with the extra backup singer? Oh, she's good fun. Plus, we figured if Jackson were to-- - Die. - Yeah, that's the word. --It would jeopardize the mission. As the series progresses, especially a series that has gone as long as SG-1... ...you start creating a-- I've been referring to it as a sort of critical mass of its own mythology... ...mythology that stops borrowing from other cultures and Earth history... ...and starts, basically, a self-generating mythology. From the very first episode of season one... ...there was little doubt that SG-1 was in for a wild ride. With the introduction of the Goa'uld... ...Apophis and his foot soldiers of the Jaffa... ...Stargate SG-1 got into a battle... ...that would span eight long and exciting seasons. Keeping true to the original movie... ...the producers of Stargate SG-1 maintained Egyptian mythology... ...as a driving, antagonistic force throughout the show. COOPER: The Goa'uld are kind of opportunists, you know? They take technology and they use that. And they also take on the roles of gods. WRIGHT: if you want to dominate a culture that already has a god... ...what could be easier than to step in and say, "Well, that's me"? - Hathor? - Yes. Have you heard of her? Hathor was the Egyptian goddess of fertility, inebriety and music. - Sex, drugs and rock ' n' roll? - In a manner of speaking. The Goa'uld take a human host and that personality is repressed. The symbiote that is the Goa'uld... ...has genetic memory of the queen that spawned it. And so they have memories that go back thousands of years. The gods of the Egyptians... ...tended to be combinations of animal and human. And what better to represent the combination of an animal and human... ...than a serpent invading a human body? COOPER: The Goa'uld are established, you know, right in the movie... ...and then in the pilot of the series, as the main bad guys for the show. And they have these very ceremonial ways. They are essentially posing as gods. And so they take on all of the pomp and circumstance. DICKSON: One of the things that's interesting about Egyptian mythology... ...is that the iconography is so recognizable... ...and is associated with grandeur... ...and bombast and excess. They're basically an arrogant worm. They're sort of a small creature that has adopted... ...the vastness and the power of a preexisting system. And so the spectacle of the Egyptian model... ...is really, really important to the show. System Lords can't be trusted, either as a group or individuals. They're posturing egomaniacs driven by an insatiable lust for power. Each one capable of unimaginable evil. Once your good guys have defeated your bad guys... ...suddenly the bad guys look weak. You either need new bad guys that are either more bad... ...or you need more bad guys. The System Lords, really, are just the most powerful Goa'ulds. I am Ba'al. As in bocce? They are the Goa'ulds who have their own armies... ...their own fleets of ships and their own territories among the stars. I think with the System Lords, what was important... ...because in every pantheon of gods... ...there was a hierarchal system and I think that was important... ...because you had all these System Lords warring with each other... ...who all seemed to represent different deities... ...from different mythos in Earth lore. Whom do you serve? - Anubis. - What? - You're lying. - He is dead. That is what you assumed after you attempted to murder him. Because of the hierarchal system, you have things going a certain way. This guy had to be more powerful and bad, if that's the way it was in history... ...in the way, you know, our ancestors understood this. It's really interesting when you get an episode like the "Summit"... ...when you have all these guys, got them in the same room. But they all kind of represent different cultural distinctions. There's Amaterasu, which is Japanese. MALLOZZI: A god from African mythology. JUDGE: Cronos, that was Greek. SHANKS: Bastet, which is Egyptian. MALLOZZI: Yu from the Chinese mythology. Although, interestingly enough, Yu is a character who... ...wasn't a god in the Chinese mythology. He was an architect or sort of a high official. They kind of adopt the culture. They kind of-- The Goa'uld kind of become the god they're portraying. The Jaffa were originally created as foot soldiers for the Goa'uld. Kill the rest. [PEOPLE SCREAMING] The Jaffa are literally the incubators for Goa'uld children. What the hell is that? It's an infant Goa'uld. The larval form of the gods. I have carried one since I was a child, as all Jaffa carry one. To show their devotion and servitude to the Goa'ulds... ...they wear their symbol on their forehead. The first primes get the gold ones and they've been cut into their foreheads... ...and molten gold has been poured in. And it's kind of a special rite of passage to get the first prime tattoo. As time went on and we began humanizing the Jaffa. More and more we're exploring the fact that they were essentially innocent. They weren't doing what they were doing because they were evil. Unlike the Goa'uld, who are genetically predisposed to be evil. I can save these people. Help me. Essentially, we would tell the Jaffa story through Teal'c. Help me. Many have said that. But you are the first I believe could do it. JUDGE: Teal'c, being dissatisfied with his situation... ...and you found out very early on... ...that there are other Jaffa that felt the same way. - Why do you defy me? - Because you are not a god. You are a parasite within a child, and I despise you. JUDGE: The basis of the movement... ...and the basis, I think, of any movement, is the people. I think that really showed that a society of people... ...are not controlled from the top down but from the bottom up. L... ...die... ...free. MALLOZZI: They finally rise up, led by Teal'c... ...and throw off the yoke of Goa'uld oppression... ...and win their freedom. In the battle against the Goa'uld, Earth needed allies. And with perfect timing, we met the Asgard. Borrowing from the look of the Roswell grays... ...and a long-standing Norse mythology... ...the Asgard represented a strength... ...that SG-1 had not seen since meeting the Goa'uld. It would later foster a friendship and an alliance... ...that would run throughout the entire series. Initially, what we had was SG-1 were the good guys... ...and the Goa'uld were the bad guys. But the Goa'uld were so powerful... ...that there was really no way that SG-1 even stood a chance. That's why the Asgard were introduced. In a way, the Asgard were, you know, as much an adversary to the Goa'uld... ...as we were, and we became friends with them. So... ...where am I? This is the Asgard planet Othala in the galaxy of Ida. The Asgards are important because they do take the show in a new direction... ...largely by introducing a new race, a new power in the galaxy. DANIEL: Ladies and gentlemen, I think this is Thor's Chariot. An Asgard mother ship. I've heard them described in Jaffa legend. In "Thor's Hammer," these people believed... ...that they would always be protected by their god, Thor. PEOPLE [CHANTING]: Thor, Thor, Thor. They appear to have all of the accoutrements... ...of an ancient Norse god. I am Thor. You're brave to come before me. Mighty Thor, we need your help. MALLOZZI: Originally, they're presented in hologram form... ...as this mighty Norse god. When you see the Asgard for what they are, they are wildly different. So we get that kind of contrast that sort of shows... ...the relationship between what we imagined and what is actually real. But we also get things, like, for instance, the notion of custodial gods, right? So Thor replaced Odin, the warrior god, because he was a custodial god... ...he looked after farms, not raiders. And Thor and the Asgard are custodial aliens. The Protected Planets Treaty and so forth. The Asgard will attempt to negotiate with the Goa'uld System Lords... ...to include Earth in the Protected Planets Treaty. That's a good thing, right? I think it was really interesting to-- Because of these aliens... ...who are not gonna fit in and be able just to converse openly. So they had to do some research. If dealing with primitive civilizations... ...they had to research, " How do we communicate to these people? And how do we get them to possibly do our bidding... ...or just find out a little more about them?" So the idea that they use technology to imitate human-type life forms... ...and that appealed to a specific culture, like the Norse people at the time... ...I think that's a little bit more interesting to me... ...and something that went on throughout the run of the series... ...and just kept evolving. The coordinates are set. - Are you ready, Colonel Carter? - Ready as I'll ever be. Initiating transport. Shortly after the Asgard were introduced, we realized... ...we've created a adversary for the Goa'uld that are, in fact, so powerful... ...that it doesn't really make sense why the Asgard... ...haven't wiped the Goa'uld out. And it was kind of looking at that hole in the series... ...that made us invent the Replicators. The original Replicators, introduced in SG-1... ...were these little mechanical creatures that consumed metal. Are you saying they're actually eating the ship? Ingesting the alloys, yes. They will continue until they risk compromising the integrity of the hulls. MALLOZZI: You had the Asgard, that are so advanced... ...that had obviously advanced past the use of these crude projectile weapons... ...who were trying to use energy-based weapons, and it wasn't having an effect. You have demonstrated their weakness may be found through... ...a less-sophisticated approach. We are no longer capable of such thinking. Wait a minute, you're actually saying you need someone dumber than you are? You may have come to the right place. MALLOZZI: And as a result, the Replicators have pretty much... ...overrun their galaxy, and we ended up doing a better job... ...of handling the threat they pose to our galaxy. The Replicators gave us a really interesting, thoughtless... ...bent-on-destruction kind of antagonist for us to face... ...but it also highlighted our own need to walk carefully... ...when dealing with artificial intelligence and with technology... ...that gets away on us. So I thought that was a nice avenue... ...for us to peruse for a while, as well. It's a good example of how an enemy, how a race, evolves... ...and becomes part of a series' canon... ...and part of the ground from which you build stories. As the writing continued to cultivate the mythology of the show... ...the scope of just how much the stargate opened us up to the universe... ...was becoming more evident with every new episode. In the same season that we met the Asgard... ...we came across an ally that would prove fruitful... ...in the fight against the Goa'uld. The Tok'ra. Kiss me. - You're kidding, right? - No. I' m not. The reason we invented the Tok'ra was, how do you get out of the problem... ...of having a Goa'uld in one of your main characters? Well, the twist is what if that Goa'uld was actually a good guy? One of the elements of the show that I really enjoyed... ...was the philosophical difference... ...between being a Jaffa, being a Goa'uld and being a Tok'ra. Goa'uld take hosts. Tok'ra do not. Ours wish to be so. We have a truly symbiotic relationship. The Tok'ra have been a longstanding ally. But their numbers are few. And they've always been a little wary of sticking their necks out too far. SG-1's search for allies and its desire to acquire technology... ...that could help Earth in its battle against unforeseen aggressors... ...was only overshadowed by the quest to understand the bigger picture. Who started it all? It was the introduction of the Ancients to the Stargate universe... ...that added a rich new layer to Stargate 's mythology. COOPER: The Ancients in "Ascension" are very much about... ...the continuation of the human soul beyond humanity as we know it. I'm an Ancient. - What? - Not me but the others like me. They're the Ancients. This is written in one of the oldest dialects of the Ancients. I always suspected but I never really knew for sure. - What does it say? - It says the Ancients evolved... ...from a race of humans that lived long before us. They were wiped out by a plague sweeping across the galaxy. And that many learned to ascend and the rest died out. - I have to go. - Daniel. We've kind of said that the Ancients are us. We are the second evolution of this physical form. And the idea of the Ancients is that they evolved. Eventually, they became so knowledgeable of the universe... ...and of the understanding of existence... ...that they were able to shed their human bodies and turn into energy. WRIGHT: And the philosophy that they then have to adopt-- Because it empowers them so, so much. --Is to not interfere. If you know what it is we're looking for... ...and, as an ascended being, I have to assume you do... As Dr. Jackson knows, it is against our highest law to interfere. They refer to that most important question-- Or one of the two most important questions of mythology. The first one is, "Where do we come from?" They answer both of those. "Where do we come from?" and "Where are we going?" So they are origin and telos, right? The beginning and the end. Jack, the markings on the wall are a language. It's a bible. Actually, it's more of an instruction book... ...on how to reach this ethereal plane of existence. Some kind of other world. It's only natural the Jaffa who found this... ...would've interpreted it as a passage to the after-- Slow down there, grasshopper. If the Ancients were really the first... ...form, human form that lived on Earth and built the stargates... ...and then went out into the galaxy from here-- As evidenced by the fact that it's our constellations on the stargate. --Then they had to have been on Earth millions of years ago. There should be evidence of that. I don't think this is it, Sam. What do you mean? The dome's too small. It's like Taonas. It's obviously not a city. It's just an outpost of some kind. - This isn't Atlantis? - I don't think so. The lost city of Atlantis is interesting because it was mystical. Even at the moment when we first heard about it in Plato... ...it had already been sunk in the sea for 9000 years. And so it brings with it that huge suitcase of history... ...and associations with that vanished past. As the seasons moved on and SG-1 aligned with their allies... ...to overpower the Goa'uld, the show took on a new direction. Events occurred that led the SG-1 team to a new race. Which caused them to reexamine everything they thought they knew... ...about the gate builders. Robert, I think quite correctly, said: " Look, let's introduce a new bad guy. Let's introduce a new, long-term, large arc... ...that can be, you know, essentially a new mythology... ...that's still very much within the Stargate universe." Once upon a time, there was a race of people that went on a journey... ...through space, across the universe. They were called the Altera. After much time-- And I think this means thousands of years. --They found a great belt of stars. And they lived happily ever after. Have you found something, Daniel Jackson? It says that the Alterans named their new home Avalon... ...and that they built many astria porta. Stargates. In "Avalon 1," Vala comes through the gate... ...and she is carrying this treasure map. The treasure map leads us-- Happens to be-- The treasure happens to be here on Earth. And it's a cache of treasure and, possibly, weapons and technology... ...that we have been looking for for years. Avalon was actually a place where Merlin helped Arthur, a mortal, ascend. Are not the Ancients prevented from interfering with the existence of mortals? Ascended, yes, for the most part. It's possible Merlin was not ascended... ...but was in fact just a human far along the evolutionary path. What does this have to do with where this alleged treasure is buried? There are a number of conflicting interpretations. Certain threads point to the Knights of the Round Table... ...gathering great treasures from Arthur's domain... ...and hiding them in a magical stronghold at Avalon. The Glastonbury Tor is the place where King Arthur was buried. Now, immediately shining a light on that makes you go: "What the heck does that have to do with anything?" You realize what this could mean? Whoa. We've always presumed that the Ancients... ...were the first evolution of humans in this galaxy. But this-- This is the first evidence suggesting they came here... ...long ago from somewhere far, far away. - Yes. - Colonel Mitchell. SHANKS: The Alterans is a way of... ...distinguishing the Ancients being an entire culture-- The Ori and the Alterans being the two aspects of that... ...that broke off in different directions. The discovery that the Alterans actually-- Potentially exist in another galaxy... ...was our way of, in season nine, of separating those two. We always kept referring to the Ancients... ...as one distinct, governing body that was always looking on. And we would just refer to them as the Ancients. And then the discovery that there are-- if there is a good one... ...then there must be a bad one here too. Hallowed are the Ori. The new direction of the show had begun. And the tides were turning with every mission. The introduction of the fundamentalist Ori... ...served notice that the battle to keep the galaxy safe was far from over. The Ori-- Unlike the Ancients, who have adopted, kind of... ...this hands-off policy towards our galaxy. The Ori are very hands-on and are the antithesis of the Ancients we created. I wanted the new bad guys... ...to have the same feeling, to have the same essence... ...that the relationship with the Goa'ulds was at the beginning of the series. They could be posing as gods but have even more power. It's all lies and propaganda, as far as they're concerned. We're wrong, they're right. They're good, we're bad. We must worship the Ori or die. And they will fight until we are dead or they are. Period. One of the things that we intentionally did... ...was looked at the colorful flamboyance of the Goa'uld... ...and took a decidedly darker approach to the Ori. The Priors are quite obviously the priests of the religion. What's interesting about them is that, again, they have supernatural abilities. The Ori, as ascended beings... ...have a certain knowledge of the way things work... ...of humans and of evolution. And so they can impart advancements on people. They can, you know, wave their magic wands... ...and give people psychic abilities or telekinesis or super-strength. Whatever. And the Priors have that. So when the Priors say, " Hey, we represent the Ori. And guess what? We have the ability to plant our staff in the ground... ...and part the Red Sea," people tend to believe them. Behold the gift... ...the Ori have bestowed upon me. COOPER: it was interesting to create bad guys that... ...from their point of view, are maybe not so bad. The warriors, the people who believe in Origin, are saying, " Hey, come on." You know, they're-- All they're saying is: " Behave yourselves and we'll help you ascend." What is there for any and all to gain by choosing the path of Origin? Those seeking eternal salvation can follow the word of the Ori. Those that do not shall die as mortals. It is as simple as that. The twist is that they're actually not helping people ascend. The Ori are actually, you know, a small group of ascended beings... ...who are manipulating people because they actually gain some sort of... ...you know, energy, power from the worship of human beings. For starters, did you know that the Ori need people to worship them... ...because that's how they gain their power? - He didn't know. - No, he didn't know that. And that they're not fulfilling the one promise of the religion. And that is that if you're good... ...you're gonna be brought up to their level. I never dreamed I would one day be fit to serve the Ori in this way. By killing people you know nothing about? All I need to know is that they are enemy of the Ori. That they reject the teachings of Origin and would have us stray from the path. These so-called unbelievers... ...they're so far away, how can they affect us? Evil must not be allowed to fester anywhere. MALLOZZI: Tomin is a excellent example of a character... ...who gets swept away in this religious fervor, if you will. He-- Unlike the Ori, or even the Priors to a certain extent... ...he's not an evil individual but incredibly misguided. And so, you feel sympathy for the character. Fear not. Once we warriors of Ori have vanquished the wicked, I shall return. COOPER: I was really interested in making the warriors multidimensional. I really wanted to kind of understand what it would be like on the other side. - You have to listen to me. - No! I am deaf to all but the teachings of Origin! So by putting Vala, you know, as a-- Behind enemy lines, so to speak, and having her develop this relationship... I mean, here's a guy who she really could have probably spent her life with. Who just also happened to be, you know, a holy crusader. Now hear the words of the Orici. WRIGHT: Right from the get go, we knew that if we had gotten into season 10... ...we needed to kind of put a figurehead on that. Put a real face on the bad guys. We created the character who has a knowledge of the Ori... ...in the form of a human being. She was, you know, immaculately conceived. Vala carried the child. And then the Ori kinda snuck one of their own over the border... ...and cheated the ancient rules. We're not rejoining the fleet. You're coming with me. - No, I can't abandon my army. - It's not your army. Of course it is. Well, I' m putting my foot down. You're too young to have your own army. With the introduction of Adria, who I liken to an evil Joan of Arc-- What of the village? Have they agreed to accept the teachings of Origin? - No. - Then burn it. --We have a character who not only embodies, you know... ...the spirit of the Ori, but is able to interact with us on a physical level. I think with the introduction of the Ori to the mythology of Stargate... ...what it's done is it has allowed us to be a little bit more intellectual... ...a little bit more contemporary... ...with our usage of the word "god" in the context of science fiction. What is a god but a being that is worshipped by those beneath? Is great knowledge, power, understanding... ...not enough for you to revere the Ori? Respect, yes, certainly. But that doesn't mean I would murder innocent people in their name. People were saying, "The Ori are just so powerful and the Priors are so bad. I mean, how is the team ever going to defeat them? How are they ever gonna win?" And, I mean, that's kinda what we wanted. I mean, that's what the fan reaction was, I think... ...at the beginning of the series when here we have the Goa'ulds. They have these ships and technology. How are we ever gonna beat them? Well, eight years later, we did. We kicked their asses. And now, we have to set up a situation in the same series... ...where our heroes can once again overcome... ...what seem to be, you know, incredible odds to win. As SG-1 's focus turns to the birth of a new enemy... ...the show delves further into a world of Arthurian mythology... ...and leads us on a chase for the Holy Grail. Have you heard of Merlin? Merlin. King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table Merlin? - Yes. - Was an Ancient? I think so. See? That is what I' m talking about. Merlin wasn't a particularly spiritual character in Arthurian legend. He was a guy that manipulated things... ...so that Arthur was born... ...and then helped Arthur with the business of being king. In Stargate, it's sort of the other way around again. He comes down from a holy place, from being ascended... ...and helps people towards defending themselves on the physical plane. And, also, against spiritual dangers. It made sense that this guy had-- Merlin had that capability of being a wizard... ...and sending Arthur on this quest. He really was a very powerful alien, if you will. Welcome, ye Knights of the Round Table. Men of honor, followers of the path of righteousness. Only those with wealth of knowledge... ...and truth of spirit shall be given access to the underworld. You know, the Merlin Holy Grail is a search. Is a search for something that would be the answer... ...the solution to our problems. And it's the main thrust of, you know, season 10. Searching for the device that hopefully... ...you know, if used properly, would actually kill the Ori. Your world, as well as countless others, are in danger of being overrun... ...by an enemy far more powerful than you could ever imagine. They are called the Ori. And they will destroy anyone who does not kneel before them. We know a long time ago, Merlin was working on a weapon against them. And the key to finding that weapon is inside that library. The Holy Grail is a really interesting figure... ...because it's, again, a pseudo-Christian artifact... ...that was never actually accepted officially by the Church. But it has that sort of strong, sort of Christian association... ...brought by Joseph of Arimathea to England. And being associated with resurrection and purity of heart. Prudence, wisdom, charity, kindness and faith. Let these be your guide on this perilous quest. So it has this really long history. But it's associated with the quest. And with nobility and with chivalry and all of those kinds of things. And it has, therefore, a really strong redemptive quality to it. It was lost because humanity was wicked. So that notion that, when we find it, there's a kind of redemption. But it's tricky in this context... ...because it's also associated with potential genocide, right? In the fact that it could destroy the Ori... ...and anybody else who happens to be ascended. I think, through us using this, we're able to take something... ...other than just using deities and their stories. We were able to take a little piece of our own unexplained history, possibly... ...and say, "What if it did happen, but it didn't happen like people think it did." We're talking about the Holy Grail, right? Every movie I've seen, that's a cup. No, the notion that the Grail was a cup or chalice... ...used by Christ at the last supper, was a late addition to the myth. Earlier accounts describe it variously as a dish or platter. Or, in the case of Von Eschenbach and other Middle Eastern chroniclers... ...as a stone that fell from the heavens. SHANKS: From defeating the Goa'uld, to the discovery of the Ori... ...from meeting the Asguard, to the search for the Holy Grail... ...Stargate SG-1 has created a rich, complex mythology... ...that has given the fans a reason to tune in every week. WRIGHT: Someone once compared Stargate... ...to a really cool, long and complicated novel... ...that doesn't ever have to end. COOPER: The only way you could have... ...that kind of complex, rich, detailed mythology... ...is to have it slowly evolve over the course of 10 years. Hard to believe when you say that. DICKSON: The success of the show... ...I think, is very much tied to that larger superstructure. The ability to take something that we know... ...something that we recognize-- The pyramids, for example. --And to give it to us in a new way. SHANKS: So after 10 seasons and over 200 episodes, Stargate SG-1 has... ...with the help of some of the world's greatest myths... ...taken the fans on a fantastic voyage. And the voyage continues.
