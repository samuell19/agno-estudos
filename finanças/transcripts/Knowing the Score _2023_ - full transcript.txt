WOMAN: The Opera House has always meant a lot to me. WOMAN: The Opera House It's a cultural icon. It's a cultural icon. It's an international cultural icon. There's a wonderful serendipity It's an international cultural icon. There's a wonderful serendipity to return here, There's a wonderful serendipity to the privileged and honoured role to the privileged and honoured role of Chief Conductor of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra. MAN: This...unassuming girl from quite an ordinary family in Sydney comes back to take from quite an ordinary family in Sydney comes back to take the most important musical position in the country, the most important musical position in the country, having failed once before. having failed once before. (APPLAUSE) It looks a very fairy-tale and... picture-book kind of career. But of course there have been lots of struggles, But of course there have been lots of disappointments. lots of disappointments. When I started, I faced considerable opposition When I started, and I heard, often, and I heard, often, "You'll never make it as a conductor. "It's just not going to happen. The world's not ready for it." I grew up in the Sydney beachside suburb of Manly. That probably explains why all my life I've been drawn to water. all my life The ferry runs from Manly to Sydney, The ferry runs from Manly to Sydney, and Dad and I would often take trips on the ferry. So I've actually spent my entire childhood watching the Sydney Opera House being built. And so it was the first place where I heard a symphony concert. It was a revelation. It was a revelation. I had never heard anything that sounded like this. I had never heard anything that sounded like this. It was Leonard Bernstein conducting, on tour with the New York Phil, and it was Tchaikovsky 6. Just blown away by the sound. There's no way I would have had any clue what Bernstein was doing when I was watching him, except for the fact that the music was extraordinary. That symphony has remained with me ever since. It's still absolutely up there in my top five symphonies. I remember telling this story to someone who then added, It's still absolutely up there in my top five symphonies. I remember telling this story to someone who then added, "Oh, you probably ran down the front and said, 'Give me that stick.'" "Oh, you probably ran down the front and said, 'Give me that stick.'" But, no, that's not true. (LAUGHS) But, no, that's not true. (LAUGHS) Almost 50 years after hearing my first Leonard Bernstein concert Almost 50 years after hearing at the Sydney Opera House, at the Sydney Opera House, I'm now on my way to rehearse with his orchestra, I'm now on my way the New York Philharmonic. the New York Philharmonic. My debut performance with the New York Phil was actually back in 1998. So now this is my third visit as a guest conductor. WOMAN: Mega prestigious. Think of who has stood upon the podium - WOMAN: Mega prestigious. Think of who has stood upon the podium - Mahler, Toscanini, Bernstein, Tchaikovsky, Dvorak. Bernstein, Tchaikovsky, Dvorak. I mean, it's very special. I mean, it's very special. SIMONE: OK. Here we go. I'll be listening very much to the timps and to the...the kind of sticks you should be using. But, basically any sort of internal balance notes you can give me, that's really useful. Oh, OK. OK? (ORCHESTRA TUNES) We're performing in the Alice Tully Hall. I've never seen it. I've never performed in there. I have no idea how the sound is going to be. So I'll be very glad to have the rehearsal out of the way So I'll be very glad to have and just know exactly where I stand. and just know exactly where I stand. Can we go from 249, please? and just know exactly where I stand. Can we go from 249, please? 249. And... (ORCHESTRA BEGINS) Yeah, already. Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh, sh. Already, it's just too thick. Alright? We have piano in the horns. That's fine. We have piano in the horns. Mezzo forte in the woodwinds. Mezzo forte in the woodwinds. But once you move Mezzo forte in the woodwinds. But once you move to a sustained note, But once you move you must come off it you must come off it to create room for the other voices. to create room This symphony should be... This symphony should be... ..Beethoven struggling. It shouldn't be Bruckner and Wagner, uh, looking backwards. So I think we need to just uh, looking backwards. So I think we need to just take some of the steam So I think we need to just out of the middle of the sound out of the middle of the sound and just think a slimmer sound. Um, and not too much power, not too much muscle. OK. In please, in. (ORCHESTRA BEGINS) Yeah. Sorry. WOMAN: Some conductors, when they don't come to us very often are a little intimidated, WOMAN: Some conductors, when they don't come to us very often are a little intimidated, and we respond far better to somebody who shows that and we respond far better to somebody who shows that they're comfortable in that position, they're comfortable in that position, and she certainly is comfortable with that. SIMONE: I like to try to equate the work of a conductor SIMONE: I like to try to equate with that of a sports coach. with that of a sports coach. Every single player on the field knows what they're doing and they're all specialists. But it takes a great coach and they're all specialists. But it takes a great coach to bring all that together But it takes a great coach and to create something special. and to create something special. And that's a little bit like the conductor. We're like icebergs. 90% of what we do, you don't see because it's happened in the rehearsal studio. because it's happened You just see the last 10%. You just see the last 10%. If you've got the Brahms 1 there, that we're doing this week, that would be great. I'm always fascinated by what's contained in archives. I'm always fascinated by The New York Philharmonic, The New York Philharmonic, I mean, their archives go back 180 years. I mean, their archives And how many of my heroes, And how many of my heroes, how many of the people And how many of my heroes, how many of the people whose recordings I've collected, how many of the people and also long before that. and also long before that. It's fascinating for me to look at Bernstein's scores and just see the markings of a working conductor in those scores, what he was thinking, and see how much resonates with what I choose to do. I love it - he writes in his scores in lots of different languages, I love it - he writes in his scores just like I do. just like I do. "Doppio fur allegro." (CHUCKLES) Two things I saw in Bernstein's score today of the Brahms 1. One was the double woodwind, which I would definitely not do. The other one was a big circle around a particular timpani note. The other one was a big circle That timpani note's important That timpani note's important because that timpani note ONLY happens if you do the repeat in the first movement, which means it was really significant to Bernstein which means it was to do the repeat. to do the repeat. And I believe fervently in doing that repeat. And it's just nice to say, "Well, hey, you know, he did too." And it's just nice to say, That's... That's great. That's... That's great. What very quickly becomes apparent is you have What very quickly becomes apparent is you have the greatest instrument there is you have with which to perform, with which to perform, and with which to realize the colours and the structures that you have in your mind for this piece of music. What's special about Simone? What's special about her style? She's confident, she's musical, she's very focused, and there's something - I'm going to use an American term - which is she is not - NOT - a showboat, what we call a showboat. She doesn't show off on the podium. It's about the music, and that's a beautiful thing. (ORCHESTRA FINISHES) (APPLAUSE) Something stirs in my heart, a little bit, Something stirs in my heart, of sort of the big-eyed teenager, of sort of the big-eyed teenager, thinking about the big musical world. But, now I feel very much thinking about the big musical world. But, now I feel very much at home in these places, But, now I feel very much because of the music. because of the music. LEBRECHT: If you look at the background - daughter of immigrant parents, no money in the background, no connections, goes to school, plays all sorts of instruments - piccolo, guitar, goodness knows what - and has the very, very, very good fortune of being taken under the wing of Stuart Challender. Challender was a really formative influence and she couldn't have had a better one. SIMONE: Stuart was an extraordinary figure. And a wonderful intensity and calm within himself. We used to call him the praying mantis, because the arms were so incredibly long. (LAUGHS) Stuart was the first musician conductor that I had met and worked with to whom I could relate. (ORCHESTRA FINISHES) I joined Opera Australia (ORCHESTRA FINISHES) I joined Opera Australia as a pianist repetiteur. The very first rehearsal I played with Stuart conducting The very first rehearsal was a rehearsal of Walkure. was a rehearsal of Walkure. And I'd literally been thrown in and was sight-reading act one of Walkure. And at the end of it, Stuart came over to me and said, "The last person to do anything like that around here was me. "The last person to do anything "I think I hate you." "I think I hate you." I mean, I have this weird thing "I think I hate you." I mean, I have this weird thing called perfect pitch that is obviously genetic. I'm sure, had my Dad been trained musically, he would have discovered he also had perfect pitch. He had excellent memory for pitches that he had heard. He had excellent memory I'm synesthetic. I'm synesthetic. I hear keys and notes as colours, as well as specifics. Um, it's not that uncommon in as well as specifics. Um, it's not that uncommon in people who have perfect pitch. For me, sound is not an abstract. For me, sound is not an abstract. It actually has weights, it has shape, it has structure - It actually has weights, it has shape, it has structure - just like fluid, like water. It is magic. How else do you explain the fact that a note sounds different whether the musician is smiling or not? a note sounds different whether Yes, it's magic. Yes, it's magic. In 1985 and 1986, I was conducting regularly for the Australian opera, and it was Stuart who said that I really needed to go away to take my measure, basically, I really needed to go away against other young conductors, against other young conductors, other young, talented people in Europe and just expose myself to all those wonderful influences. I came over here to Europe, to check out what was happening for other young people in the area of conducting - specifically in opera. You're invited to a house. You come and do one or two performances. You get one rehearsal. Meet the singers, you spend two or three days rehearsing Meet the singers, you spend and you're in. and you're in. And then everybody has a look at you. The singers have a look at you. The management has a look at you. The orchestra have a good look at you and they all decide whether they want you to come back again. It is the classic path to conductorship for a reason. and they all decide whether they want you to come back again. It is the classic path to conductorship for a reason. It means that you really know the opera world It means that you really know and the opera repertoire inside out and the opera repertoire inside out if you begin doing repetiteur work, like she did. if you begin doing repetiteur work, So you're working with singers, So you're working with singers, maybe conducting some rehearsals. You're really doing the nuts and bolts work of opera. You're really doing (APPLAUSE) (APPLAUSE) SIMONE: I was starting at (APPLAUSE) SIMONE: I was starting at the bottom again in Germany. I was the only woman on the music staff in Cologne. I was the only woman I came from a country that I came from a country that people did not connect, immediately - we're talking the mid-'80s - people did not connect Australia, immediately, with the classical arts, much more with sport. MAN: I don't think we had any choice about whether we were MAN: I don't think we had any choice about whether we were doing the right thing. Once we'd committed ourselves to Germany, and we seemed to be going deeper and deeper into debt, and we seemed to be going there was no way out. there was no way out. there was no way out. So we just, uh, we just had to stay there and do it. So we just, uh, we just had to stay there and do it. I just wondered, at the time, how many years will this take? SIMONE: My husband used to call the classical music industry as the industry of broken dreams and disappointed hopes because for every opportunity that became a reality there were probably 10 that were promised, there were probably 10 that didn't turn into anything. that didn't turn into anything. MAN: She was recommended to me by several people MAN: She was recommended to me who had worked with her in Cologne who had worked with her in Cologne and said that she was a very, very fine musician and she was a very good conductor already. And I was stunned, and she was a very good conductor already. And I was stunned, because for the first time, and I must say, until now, the only time, and I must say, until now, the only time, that I have seen a woman conductor that I have seen a woman conductor who completely that I have seen a woman conductor who completely asexualised her gestures. And I mean that, obviously, in a positive sense. Her gestures are there for what she wants to achieve. Her gestures are there Factually. Factually. SIMONE: I was a huge fan of his piano work long before I met him as a conductor. Curiously, my Dad used to talk about long before I met him as a conductor. Curiously, my Dad used to talk about listening to Daniel Barenboim Curiously, my Dad used to talk about when Daniel, as a young soloist, when Daniel, as a young soloist, came out to Australia and did ABC tours, came out to Australia and Dad heard them all on the radio. and Dad heard them all on the radio. I was desperately nervous the first time I had to actually sit at a piano and play at the piano for Daniel Barenboim. (LAUGHS) Well, it would be like bowling to Alan Border, you know? Well, it would be like bowling to It's... (LAUGHS) It's... (LAUGHS) What do I do? I can't deal with this. That statement by Daniel that my gestures were asexual, That statement by Daniel that my gestures were asexual, I took as a huge compliment... I took as a huge compliment... ..because it just dropped the 'woman' out of the expression 'woman conductor'. To him, I was A conductor. His acceptance of me as such... ..essentially, very traditional orchestras ..essentially, then saw me through his eyes, then saw me through his eyes, and helped to break down then saw me through his eyes, and helped to break down some of those barriers. Vienna has, for centuries, been really one of the centre points of classical music in Europe. And anybody who was anybody came through here. Although it's not where my career started, it was probably one of the big milestones. When I debuted here, November 1993, it was very famously the first time a woman had conducted in the Vienna State Opera, which, in some ways, actually took the pressure off because I remember standing outside the pit in the little alcove, waiting to be sent in at the top. in the little alcove, I was very nervous, of course, I was very nervous, of course, as you always would be under those circumstances, and not having had any rehearsal. Thinking, well this could either go wonderfully, and for the next 25 years of my life I'll be a regular visitor here. Or it could be two of I'll be a regular visitor here. Or it could be two of the most embarrassing hours Or it could be two of of my life so far. of my life so far. And yet I'll still go into the history books as the first woman who conducted here. So that's not too bad. So the worst possible outcome is still alright. And with that, I took a deep breath And with that, and walked into the pit. and walked into the pit. Well, because Vienna is the single most conservative musical city, and walked into the pit. Well, because Vienna is the single most conservative musical city, probably on the planet, most conservative musical city, probably on the planet, probably on the planet, that was a big deal. that was a big deal. In 1991, uh, I published that was a big deal. In 1991, uh, I published a book called The Maestro In 1991, uh, I published and there were no women conductors. and there were no women conductors. I mean, literally, there was nobody in any major orchestra in the world in any position of influence or of authority in any position of influence who was a woman. who was a woman. It was that male-dominated - and we're talking just 30 years ago. There was just, frankly, a lot of prejudice. Some of it from just basic, good, old misogyny. SIMONE: It is remarkable that the Vienna Phil only voted to admit women to the orchestra in 1997. What was their excuse? Women have periods. Women have babies. Excuse me. (LAUGHS) It's remarkable, really, when you think about that. SIMONE: Sometimes an audience is a little surprised, like, uh, "Oh, good heavens, it's a girl!" And some people lean over the railing of the pitch And some people lean to have a really good look. (LAUGHS) to have a really good look. (LAUGHS) JOURNALIST: They're leaning to have a really good look. (LAUGHS) JOURNALIST: They're leaning over the railings JOURNALIST: They're leaning and cheering to the rafters. and cheering to the rafters. The first woman to conduct the great orchestras The first woman to conduct of Paris, Berlin and Vienna, of Paris, Berlin and Vienna, Australian Simone Young has become one of the most sought-after conductors around. (MOUTHS) She's really not, uh, not gimmick, the fact that, uh, you know, a lady is conducting. the fact that, uh, you know, a lady is conducting. She's really a true musician. She's really a true musician. JOURNALIST: To New York now, where there's been a once-in-a-lifetime event for an Australian who's about to make the big time at the famous Metropolitan Opera. SIMONE: The Met is really something special. You know, we often make the joke, when a phone rings during rehearsal, we'll say, "Oh, it's the Met calling." Um, there's something very magic about saying 'the Met'. There are no nerves while you're... while I'm actually conducting. The nerves are all beforehand, or in the interval. (LAUGHS) But while you're actually doing it, there's no time to be nervous because the very definition of nervousness is that because the very definition you're focussing on yourself anyway - you're focussing on yourself anyway - how is this going to affect your future, are they going to like me - you know, all that sort of thing. are they going to like me - Whereas when I'm performing, Whereas when I'm performing, I can't be thinking about myself because I've got too many other people to think about. JOURNALIST: Who do you turn to when you've had a wonderful night, a great performance, when you've had a wonderful night, a great performance, to say, well, we've climbed the mountain today? to say, well, we've climbed the mountain today? SIMONE: That's really hard to do. Personal enjoyment, personal appreciation of whether you've done a good job or not, that's a very private thing. If my husband's around, we'll celebrate that together. OK? Wonderful. (INAUDIBLE) I tried very hard, for many years to say this is my choice, to have this crazy career and to have a family. So I need to invest all the time I have So I need to invest in all of those things. in all of those things. And I ended up just being, I think, essentially, sleep-deprived for about 20 years. We try to tailor our schedules so that if I'm away We try to tailor our schedules so that if I'm away for a long stretch of time they can come for a while so that we're never apart for too long. they can come for a while so that I'm a bit of a believer in fate I'm a bit of a believer in fate and things falling out because that's the way they're meant to do. And it's the same with meeting people. I mean, how much luck is involved in that? I met Greg because I was unhappy at the Conservatorium and I dropped out of my course and went to teach piano at Riverview. Greg happened to be teaching there at that school and, I mean, we're just a good pair together. and, I mean, we're just We just sort of work. We just sort of work. He knows when I'm stressed out. He tells a funny story about when I was just starting to conduct and I was conducting a lot, but it was very stressful - and I was conducting a lot, no rehearsal and in you go. no rehearsal and in you go. I would conduct in my sleep. He would collect the third beat in the middle of his back, you know, in the middle of the night. He's put up with a lot. (LAUGHS) I like La Boheme and Tosca as my first two favourites. as my first two favourites. Firstly... Firstly... ..because they're shorter. And secondly, because there's just more excitement in it. Simone and I often hanker for the space and the light and the way people relate to one another, things like that, that are typical of Australia, that you don't find in European countries. SIMONE: They didn't make my career choices for me. They've been enormously supportive of them. But they shouldn't have to suffer because of them. I'm establishing myself in Europe and America as a concert conductor as well as an opera conductor, as a concert conductor and it's time I did that out here. and it's time I did that out here. MAN: Simone Young interview slate one, take one. JOURNALIST: Simone Young is one of the most talented conductors JOURNALIST: Simone Young is of her generation, of her generation, and certainly one of the most famous Australians of her generation, and certainly one of the most famous Australians since Sir Charles Mackerras and Richard Bonney. (APPLAUSE) I actually heard Simone conduct the orchestra I actually heard Simone conduct the orchestra last Wednesday at the Opera House. conduct the orchestra It was just fantastic. It was just fantastic. You did all that, with that great talent - in high heels. You did all that, with that I thought it was sensational. I thought it was sensational. (LAUGHTER) Gee, no chauvinism around here. I've heard a lot of very stupid comments and questions, I've heard a lot of very stupid from the most well-meaning of people from the most well-meaning of people who simply didn't understand from the most well-meaning of people who simply didn't understand that what they were saying was, many would, today, say, offensive. I would say simply stupid. What does being a woman have to do with conducting? My tits don't get in the way. MAN: Very forceful and demonstrative conductor, MAN: Very forceful fascinating for audiences to watch, fascinating for audiences to watch, because she waves her arms around a lot. She has a long, flowing hairstyle, so that she's a real... a show-woman, as it were. Workaholic, perfectionist, control freak - it's all part of the job description. it's all part of (INAUDIBLE OVER MUSIC) (INAUDIBLE OVER MUSIC) I mean, I'm very direct. Too much, that's too much. Sometimes that's a plus. Sometimes it's minus. Sometimes that's a plus. (INDISTINCT OVER MUSIC) (INDISTINCT OVER MUSIC) I have a friend who once said to me, "You know, what I really love about you, Simone, "You know, what I really "is you absolutely lack tact." "is you absolutely lack tact." Oh, for God's sake. So dumb... And sometimes, a conductor, you must. I think it's still hard for a lot of people to take direct authority, direct commands from a woman. She has been too much in control of the performances, and not allowed individual performances to develop and plumb the emotional depths to develop and plumb that they might have otherwise done. that they might have otherwise done. I, as well as other critics and opera lovers have had some reservations about some of her performances. JOURNALIST: But there was a much more serious problem, JOURNALIST: But there was as the bottom line headed south, as the bottom line headed south, and the company headed for the rocks, the maestro, it's alleged, wouldn't listen. I asked her, on radio, if it comes down to I asked her, on radio, if it comes down to a clash between the players and the management a clash between the players and the management are you with the musicians, are you with the musicians, or are you management? Which side are you on? And Simone said, "I'm on the side of the music." MAN: I think it's really a major responsibility of any artistic director in this present time MAN: I think it's really a major responsibility of any artistic director in this present time to be as responsible for the artistic vision to be as responsible for the artistic vision and direction of the company and direction of the company as they are for the financial vision and direction of the company. And I think they're inseparable. Just over three years ago, And I think they're inseparable. Just over three years ago, Just over three years ago, a triumphant return home Simone Young made a triumphant return home Simone Young made a triumphant return home to become Opera Australia's Music Director. to become Opera Australia's Music Director. But in a plot rivalling the best on-stage drama, But in a plot rivalling the company announced last September the company announced last September that her contract the company announced last September that her contract would not be renewed. SIMONE: The point of separation was a call from my manager to say the board have decided not to renew. There was, unfortunately, no conversation at the time. There was, unfortunately, It was all very messy, very awkward, It was all very messy, very awkward, very sorry for everybody involved. She'd made a life-changing decision. She was going to give up a flourishing career in the Northern Hemisphere and the board go, "No, get rid of her." What is that? Privately, I heard people just had to ask you how you felt and you'd be in floods of tears. SIMONE: (CHUCKLES) Of course. How long did it take you to get over it? How long did it take you Um, a long time, I think. Um, a long time, I think. Of course, I immediately said I'll never run an opera company ever again. WOMAN: Would you ever come back? Um... Not in the immediate future. Ever... Ever is a long time. And conductors have long careers. (APPLAUSE) There'd have to be some changes, and I think there needs to be a little bit of time for healing on all sides first. I think it made me slightly less reliant on that neediness for approval. If I was going to give my best and my everything and 150% and still end up going through a very torrid time, and still end up going through then don't stop giving 150%, then don't stop giving 150%, but don't need the approval then don't stop giving 150%, but don't need the approval quite so much. but don't need the approval So, yes, I think it did... So, yes, I think it did... Is that toughening up? Or is that just learning to be a little bit more Or is that just learning to be a little bit more self-contained, perhaps? My appointment to Hamburg is something that perhaps Australians don't really something that perhaps Australians don't really understand the significance of. Australians don't really But it is a major appointment. But it is a major appointment. One thing leads to the next, somehow. And I look back at many things I did with Opera Australia with tremendous pride and great happiness. I don't look back on those times with any kind of regret or rancour because if I hadn't gone through with any kind of regret or rancour because if I hadn't gone through all of that in Opera Australia, because if I hadn't gone through I never would have managed Hamburg. I never would have managed Hamburg. (WOMAN SPEAKS GERMAN) (SPEAKS GERMAN) (WOMAN SPEAKS GERMAN) (SPEAKS GERMAN) SIMONE: Hamburg was huge. And at the end of it, I said it would have to be something pretty special to lure me into any kind of relationship to lure me into with any organization that with any organization that involved anything other than with any organization that involved anything other than just music-making. Hamburg was all-encompassing. It was my second daughter's, basically, her school life from the age of 8 to 17, and I wanted to be around for most of that. I wanted at least that we would have breakfast together, I wanted at least that most of the time, you know? most of the time, you know? In the years that followed Hamburg, I continued to guest conduct around the world, I continued to guest conduct but then the offer came but then the offer came to become the Sydney Symphony Orchestra's Chief Conductor and the time was right to return home to this great orchestra, and the time was right to return home and my cherished Sydney Opera House. and my cherished Sydney Opera House. In its 90-year history, and my cherished Sydney Opera House. In its 90-year history, the Sydney Symphony Orchestra's had quite a few conductors, the Sydney Symphony Orchestra's had quite a few conductors, some of them rather illustrious. some of them rather illustrious. MAN: Simone will be the third Australian Chief Conductor of the Sydney Symphony MAN: Simone will be the third Australian Chief Conductor of the Sydney Symphony after Charles Mackerras and Stuart Challender. It is an incredibly narrow field, conductors, and particularly narrow when you get to the absolute elite. She's entering the challenge from a position of quite great height and it'll be fascinating to see how she copes with that. SIMONE: The relationship between a conductor and an orchestra SIMONE: The relationship between is a musical one, is a musical one, it's a personal one, it's coloured by the physical and political and financial situation that an orchestra finds itself in at a given time. that an orchestra finds itself in There are so many factors There are so many factors that can really disturb There are so many factors that can really disturb that relationship that can really disturb between a conductor and an orchestra between a conductor and an orchestra that actually have nothing to do with the musical communication. Covid hadn't happened when I signed on the dotted line. The orchestra's return to the Opera House, and my first concert as Chief Conductor Are both significantly delayed. When it first started, and opera houses, orchestras started closing down, I remember thinking, "Well, that's a bit extreme." I remember thinking, And then it just rolled on and on. And then it just rolled on and on. I mean, completely unimaginable. The Sydney Symphony up until March 2020, had never stopped performing. And there are many opera houses and orchestras around the globe And there are many opera houses who were in the same boat. who were in the same boat. None of us ever imagined that it could last this long. You know, being a musician is not just a job. Being a musician also defines who we are. And suddenly that was all ripped away. And suddenly that was I found it quite devastating. I found it quite devastating. Not because of loss of career I found it quite devastating. Not because of loss of career or loss of any of those things, Not because of loss of career but that loss of sense of self. but that loss of sense of self. But then you put that into context, to people who can't sit next to their mother while they die in a hospital. Do we really matter? This is my little refuge, my secret safe place in Sydney. I come in here and I feel like I've stolen time away from my schedule. Half a wool shop, and half psychiatrist. Half a wool shop, (LAUGHS) (LAUGHS) Yeah. So you remember Mum? Yeah. I think I brought her in here. Well, yeah, things are not great, you know? But she's going to be 98 next month. So... Gosh. 98. It's pretty amazing that she's still with us. And of course the pandemic's been awful, because normally we would make sure that someone from the family was out here someone from the family every couple of months. every couple of months. And it's been six months now since I've seen her. Oh, God, that's awful. And the deterioration has been pretty significant. And the deterioration (ALL CHEER) (ALL CHEER) She does really enjoy watching me knit. She knows she taught me how to do it. She knows she taught me She was Miss Perfectionist. She was Miss Perfectionist. Was she? Of course. We still laugh about a story where, you know, I was knitting a piece like this and examining it, I was knitting a piece like this found a mistake down there, found a mistake down there, and she insisted I unpick the whole thing. It's probably where my perfectionism comes from. Maybe. Do you think? My new appointment with the Sydney Symphony Orchestra doesn't mean I'm giving up the rest of the world. After nearly nine months of being locked down owing to Covid, After nearly nine months of Paris is back in business, Paris is back in business, with the magnificent Bastille Day Gala. This insane program that was nearly two hours long covered everything from Bach to Oscar Peterson and everything in between. To go from nothing, to looking out and seeing 15,000 people on the grass, to looking out and seeing and hearing this incredible music, and hearing this incredible music, the overwhelming feedback one got from the audience was, "Thank God you're back." Audiences were euphoric, was, "Thank God you're back." Audiences were euphoric, because they had missed it so much. because they had missed it so much. (CHEERING) (CHEERING) You only need to look at the response and the wide demographic of the audiences who are hungry and lining up for the concerts who are hungry and lining up that you see that you see that there is still a passion that you see that there is still a passion and a love and a curiosity that there is still a passion and a NEED for this. and a NEED for this. Being able to speak the language of the country well has always stood me in good stead has always stood me in good stead in France, Italy, and Germany, and Austria, of course. in France, Italy, and Germany, and Austria, of course. I developed early a great love of I developed early a great love of classical literature and mythology and poetry. Books are extraordinary. And a score is a book, and people have read it. Other eyes have seen that same information Other eyes have seen and drawn different things from it, and drawn different things from it, taken different levels and drawn different things from it, taken different levels of understanding from it. And any connection I can find to any of that, And any connection I'm grateful for. I'm grateful for. It's 28 years this year since I debuted at the Staatsoper in Vienna. I've done, apparently, more than 200 performances there, though I lost count after a hundred. (SPEAKS GERMAN) (SINGS FINAL WORDS) MAN: It only shows how incredibly alive in the moment she is.

And with this very difficult piece, Peter Grimes, And with this very difficult piece, Peter Grimes, And with this very difficult piece, it's just a sight to behold it's just a sight to behold how comfortable she is in that environment and that's why she was born to be a conductor. Being so clear with what she wants and how she wants it, that makes me a much better singer too. (SONG ENDS) (APPLAUSE) SIMONE: After the performance, the Vienna State Opera had SIMONE: After the performance, the Vienna State Opera had an enormous surprise for me. The Ehrenmitgliedschaft, honorary membership of the Vienna State Opera is a great honour that's awarded to very few artists, and it's an honour that, seriously, I never expected, and it's an honour that, and I'm delighted to receive. and I'm delighted to receive. There's just something about when that plane lands at Sydney, There's just something about when that plane lands at Sydney, I start to smile, I start to smile, and I see the colour of that sky and I know I'm home. This is extraordinary. The ambience, it's so intimate. It doesn't feel at all like a revamped hall. It doesn't feel at all It feels like a completely new hall. It feels like a completely new hall. There's a lovely sweep with the risers on the stage which create an atmosphere, a sense, which create an atmosphere, a sense, a feeling of a hug around the orchestra. a feeling of a hug around the orchestra. The fact that the orchestra's in phenomenal shape was the main reason to do this now. Often, the conductor is standing on the worst possible place to actually be an objective judge of what is going on around them. You have to be 10 rows back in the theatre to get the sort of complete acoustic picture. Something about the proportion of the stage now feels like this is what I'm used to. This is LA. This San Fran. This is Berlin. WOMAN: Also, do you think the fact that the stage has been lowered, This is Berlin. WOMAN: Also, do you think the fact that the stage has been lowered, WOMAN: Also, do you think the fact that the stage has been lowered, I think just makes more of... It makes a huge difference. I think just makes more of... It makes a huge difference. ..enormous difference, and we have a lot more sort of contact and intimacy with the audience. And it means the people in the front row are no longer staring up everybody's skirts. Yeah. Or taking in who's wearing odd socks. MAN: Right now, the light's at the end of the tunnel. I can't underestimate just how important this concert is, for the Sydney Symphony, I can't underestimate just how important this concert is, for the Sydney Symphony, but I also think for the Sydney Opera House. And it will be a significant event in classical music, internationally. OK. Thank you. I don't want to ask Dave to play louder because that's absolutely gorgeous, but this is about 300% too loud. This should be just colour in the background. This should be just colour I know it's a whole new space, I know it's a whole new space, but you REALLY can play pianissimi. MAN: Simone's attention to detail is a really significant part of her work with us. MAN: Simone's attention to detail is a really significant part of her work with us. She's very demanding in, I think, a very good way. She's very demanding in, I think, a very good way. She's very insistent on what she would like us to do She's very insistent on what she would like us to do and that really makes rehearsals intense. OK, that's fine. But the celli, OK, that's fine. But the celli, and particularly the basses, you need to be ready to play the final quaver of the bar you need to be ready to play a little earlier. a little earlier. If you insist on the crotchets... # TEE da. # ..I'm never going to get you to move. Have to be ready to move into the quavers. Yeah? WOMAN: I really like having a female conductor. It's really interesting, actually, you... WOMAN: I really like having a female conductor. It's really interesting, actually, you... you wouldn't think it would make so much difference, you wouldn't think it would make so much difference, but, actually, for me, but, actually, for me, in a quiet, kind of calming way, it does. She's not afraid to just be a boss, you know? I can't help but feel a little bit empowered with her up the front, because I feel like... with her up the front, ..she's really got it under control, ..she's really got it under control, and I can just relax. Absolutely beautiful. Thank you. Absolutely gorgeous. OK, fantastic. We just have two or three little things in there that we just need to tidy up or be aware of. There is a great deal of pressure, but actually, I'm very with how the program is shaping up - but actually, I'm very with Mahler's Symphony Number 2, Mahler's Symphony Number 2, with its timeless themes of loss and resurrection, And our new composition from William Barton, Of The Earth, which speaks about hope and future generations. Of course, Will Barton is best known by most people as this extraordinary virtuoso on the digeridoo. But he introduced me to some of his compositions a few years ago, and I was really so impressed, so taken aback and I was really so impressed, by his wonderful knack of merging by his wonderful knack of merging his own Indigenous musical traditions and Western traditions, that he seemed the perfect and Western traditions, that he seemed the perfect partner for this project. He's using full Mahler instrumentation. Fantastic. The full choir. Brilliant. And the two soloists. Wonderful. So we're looking at what - 104 players? When we were looking at Mahler 2, I felt very strongly that the reopening of the concert hall was a very significant moment in Australian music history, and that it would be inappropriate to do it and that it would be without having an Australian voice without having an Australian voice as a key part of the performance. And he'd like to include the Gondwana Kids and the Sydney Children's Choir. Yeah. That's right. I heard about this, and I think this is fantastic. And how many of them will there be all together? Another sixty. Another sixty. So what are we at? 300 and something? We're heading up to 300. That's lovely. We're heading up to 300. Let's just make it a round number. Let's just make it a round number. (LAUGHS) Let's just make it a round number. (LAUGHS) Yeah. (LAUGHS) You're not going to be lonely. You're not going to be lonely. (LAUGHS) I think it's fantastic. MAN: That's the magic moment in the improvisation, where the kids come in with the clap sticks and they create that organic sound of nature coming to life. And all those amazing instruments that have a history to them, as well as the musicians playing them, as well as the musicians to the Indigenous Children's Choir to the Indigenous Children's Choir playing claps sticks made out of to the Indigenous Children's Choir playing claps sticks made out of the old and the new floorboards of the concert hall of the Opera House, of the concert hall which is pretty special. which is pretty special. (INDISTINCT CHATTER) SIMONE: I doubt myself every time I step in front of an orchestra. MC: ..on which we gather, of the Gadigal people of the Eora Nation... SIMONE: I doubt myself every time I get ready to step out on stage. SIMONE: I doubt myself every time MC: ..and extend that respect MC: ..and extend that respect to all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. SIMONE: I suspect that might be the definition of an artist, SIMONE: I suspect that might be is somebody who doubts themselves. is somebody who doubts themselves. (APPLAUSE) OK. I'll go out. (APPLAUSE) OK. I'll go out. Yes. (RENEWED APPLAUSE) SIMONE: I say my most interesting and deepest thoughts when I'm actually standing with my back to the audience, when I'm actually standing facing the orchestra and performing. facing the orchestra and performing. (APPLAUSE) SIMONE: I always think that the conductor is sort of like SIMONE: I always think that the advocate for the composer, the advocate for the composer, and that's the advocate for the composer, and that's a tremendous responsibility. (APPLAUSE) One stands humbled and a little apprehensive One stands humbled at the start of a Mahler symphony at the start of a Mahler symphony because there is a masterpiece in front of you. There are some performances where you find yourself... ..I could only describe it as flying above the performance. My natural language on the concert podium is when there are 200 people in front of me - a huge choir and a huge orchestra and there's that massed sound that you can take down to and there's that massed sound that you can take down to the smallest, most delicate line, that you can take down to then let it explode. then let it explode. (MUSIC SWELLS DRAMATICALLY) (ORCHESTRA FINISHES) (APPLAUSE) What we do does matter to people. It just makes you that bit more grateful for every bar of music you get to perform. (INDISTINCT CHATTER AND LAUGHTER) Thank you. (INDISTINCT CHATTER AND LAUGHTER) Thank you. Thank you, congratulations. Well done, Simone. Bravo. SIMONE: This was the orchestra I grew up with. There are a number of my student colleagues in the orchestra, and so there's a real sense of family. This orchestra is really part of my DNA, I think. (LAUGHS) Wonderful. (LAUGHS) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) (INDISTINCT CONVERSATION) I'm...shattered. Yes, I bet! Oh, my God, go have a glass of wine! I'm going to have a glass of bubbly, for sure. What we gave tonight was the absolute best that we could, together, coming back after 2.5 years of silence, pretty much. Um, I mean the orchestra hasn't played any Mahler since I was here with them in November 2019. since I was here with them So, um... So, um... And you heard it from the response from the audience. Everyone was so excited and so happy to be back and so grateful for this incredible music that just makes us, I think, better human beings. that just makes us, I'm a little overwhelmed right now. I'm a little overwhelmed right now. I think I'd just like to sit in the corner and be a bit quiet. (LAUGHS) I guess if I could give some advice to that girl back then, it would've been to go a little easier on herself. And to not think that she had to prove herself at every turn. Perhaps now I would say to that girl, "It's OK, it will change." Captions by Red Bee Media Copyright Australian Broadcasting Corporation
