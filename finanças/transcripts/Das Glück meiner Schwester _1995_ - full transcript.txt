LUNA FILM PRESENTS A FILM BY ANGELA SCHANELEC MY SISTER'S GOOD FORTUNE - I don't know. - What? I don't know whether I am in love with you today. But I don't want you to leave. I don't want you to go to Isabel. I'm a little tired. I'm sick of all this shit. I have to talk so that I don't have to hate you for this crap. And you shouldn't talk at all. But I didn't... I spoke very quietly. Yes, but it irritates me. That you have the courage to talk at all, rather than be quiet. That's not normal. But I want it to be normal. The crazy stuff is only beautiful in stories, not in life. I once dreamt of loving a man whom I couldn't have. And then to become a nun, feeling nothing but pure love. And now I'm in love with you and want to sleep with you. I'm still young, do you think I can change? No. - And you? - No, I can't change either. I don't care if you changed. I would say... "No, we're not together any more." "He changed, he's no longer the same..." "He has grown old somehow." "And old face, an old cock." Did you think of that? Of what? Of your old face. Old nose, old ears. How long is she going to wait for the old ears, do you think? You were hungry. I haven't eaten anything. Do you want me to join you? Look at me. - What are you thinking? - I'm not thinking anything. But you are. In your head. Are we staying here? If you like. Yes. For a while. Are you happy? Say it. Tell me you are happy. Yes, I am. I am happy. It's that simple. Isabel. Do you know there used to be a brand of car by that name? You mean Isetta. No, Isabella. The first child was named after a car, the second after a rocket. It isn't true, anyway. The Ariane rocket came after I was born I came first. Do you know the film The Loves of Ariane? Yes. I have to pee. I'll come, too. Audrey Hepburn plays the cello, do you remember? And she has a darling father. Kind, caring, loving, anything you like. Like the father in Schnitzler's Flirtation. He was helpless, too, when his daughter fell in love. And when it killed her, he had to continue living with a broken heart. There's the bus. The women are wearing short coats. Above the knee, buttoned at the front, light-coloured socks. - Stockings. - Stockings. Most of the younger ones have their hair permed blonde. What else? Many have been with the firm for a long time, they're proud of it. Pretty noisy. Is that all of them? Yes, I've sorted through them already. That's finished. You finished for today? No, it's going to be a late one, today. I want to live with Isabel, I'm going to leave Ariane. Did you toss a coin or something? You don't believe me? You're not picking Ariane up today, then? I am. I have to tell her. What time is it? Half past three. She's not stupid, perhaps she knows already. How so? She doesn't know. And Isabel? She'll be dumbstruck I think I would prefer Ariane. Is that supposed to be advice? I wouldn't dare. Aren't you hungry? No, we had bread dumplings today. Ariane and I won't come for dinner any more. Will you take turns? Right. I'll get on my way now. Are you coming anyway? Where? To my place. You can come to my place. You can come to my place and... think of Isabel there. You can talk about her, too, if you want. Or don't talk at all, I leave that up to you. You don't have to think, or to make any decision at all. If you want. We'll sleep together. Let's see what happens, okay? Are you thinking about it? How we're fucking? Yes. It's the best distraction. When I'm really horny... I don't think about anything at all. But that's not the issue. At work, I often don't think about anything either. I do my duties mechanically. I don't care. Or when you're watching a film. Sometimes in the winter, when I have the afternoon off, I go to the cinema. Whatever crap is on in the afternoon. And, for an hour and a half, you don't think anything at all. I don't want to compare it to fucking. It gets confusing, if one isn't careful. Thinking is an art. But to forget oneself, too. It's completely necessary, anyway. If you never forget yourself... you'll rage, you'll go mad, you can't even cry. - Stop it. - What? Are you two meeting now? You know... what's important is consistency. If you worked consistently... then you'd have a regular income. As regular as the seasons, do you understand? You can count on that. It's the same for the plants and trees, year in year out. That's what I mean by consistency. They set an example for us. I go to work in the morning... and here they are, waiting for me. Motionless. I care for them. They need me. If I left them... there'd be a pretty mess. I know that someone else would take my place, but I'm happy that it's me. Do you talk to them? Do you think I'm stupid? They can't hear me. Sometimes I talk to myself, but that's different. I'm just glad when I'm with them... and not by myself. Or... by myself, too, but not only by myself. Just like with a lover. With him, and in that I stay myself. Exactly like with you. Right now, I'm quite happy, for example. I don't want it to get dark. It's still light out. I love you. I don't want you to be sad. When you're happy, I'm happy too. It is true. But it's not enough for you. You just can't get enough. You think that is why? I don't know. She's rather beautiful. Sometimes. There's a deep wrinkle on her forehead, did you see? It's there when she's kissing. I'll have to look out for it. Do. I want to hear about it. All we ever know is one side of a person. I really think it's a problem that everyone changes depending on our perception. When I look at her, she seems maternal. Not particularly attractive, in my view. What a devastating word. And also... there's the feeling that I'll never get rid of her again. That's how it is with siblings, different fathers or not. Do you think we're similar? Not especially. When she says something, she closes her lips right away in order to emphasise it. You... You leave your mouth open most of the time. I leave my mouth open? Slightly. What about her do you like, especially? If you want to know exactly. Sometimes she has these particular phrases. - Phrases during fucking? - No. For example... I don't understand. I can't think of the whole phrase. It's from one of her translations. Obviously. Everything is from her shitty translations. She sits on a phrase until she can't shake it off any more. But that she inundates you with that stuff I do ask her about it, though. She keeps losing her train of thought, so that I have to ask her what she's thinking about at that moment. Well, that sounds exciting. Sometimes it is poetic. I'd rather poetry emerged from life, not from books. For example? For example... The promotional poster by the Bundesbahn. "The coast is clear, come in." That's rather poetic, I think. It's welcoming and simple. It warms your heart. Mine, anyway. One would have to be rather simple-minded. I'd like to know what is so much more complex about you. Nothing. I'm in search of simple things, too, but they're not so easily found. Sometimes they are. I also don't understand how you can be a photographer and not have your camera on you at all times. Do you never think about all the things you're missing? No. Then tell me what you're thinking about, for once. About you. - Did I wake you? - Yes. I gave you a key, haven't you got that? It's at home. How was it? She says you're getting a thick wrinkle on your forehead. Really? Why are you not asleep? It's early hours. I love you. And will find you. Even if the day turns dark. All my life. And still... I wandered around, searching. I love you. I love you. I love you. Your lips open. The world is numb. The world is blind. And so is the cloud. And the fallen leaves. Nothing but scattered golden dust. From which we two are made. Mum! Ah, that's lucky. Do you have any engagements? We can play later, dear. Aren't you busy? I am, Mum, I'll accompany you. How are things, good? Couldn't be better. Talk to me, are you keeping warm? Why wouldn't I be? I have heating. You'd have to keep it going if you're hanging around at home all day. - I'm not hanging around. - I mean if you're working. - Are you earning any money? - Do you think I translate for free? - So, they want you? - Yes, Mum, they do. Sometimes, I'm at the publishing house, too. I'm doing fine. Did you hear the thing about the Hempels? Which Hempels? Their son was in Ari's year. Martin Hempel, he was in my year first, but then he was put back twice. He gave me his roller skates I had to watch him pee for it. He was in your year? He hanged himself. What? They found him two days ago. Who found him? Who? That I don't know. Are you coming to the staff canteen? - See you. - Bye. - Do you ever see Ari? - Rarely. If you see her, ask her whether she can drop off a few of those roses I don't know whether she's still at the nursery. - Well, I want them. Bye. - Bye. Do you know the date of the funeral? It may take a while for a suicide. - Bye. - Bye, Mum. Bye. - I would prefer to go somewhere. - Where then? - To the cinema, perhaps? - You cannot be serious. I don't feel like the cinema. This guy who was at school with myself and Isa killed himself. Who? You don't know him. A friend of yours? Not a friend, no. Someone I knew when I was younger. Last night I dreamt about him. I was back home. Where we used to live, Fleming Street. But it was rural... with a large village square. But I knew that it was Fleming Street. I was with all these people... whom I didn't know. We were in this long queue, all of us. On a hill. As if waiting for a museum to open, but it was a kind of cave. This boy stood at the entrance... and let in one person after the other. When it was my turn he showed me everything. Showed you what? Inside the cave were many long hallways. Sometimes a hallway became wider. Acrobats performed in there. Juggling, dancing, you know, like at the circus. The acrobats were all dead people. And the visitors... they could... watch what happens when you're dead. After that, he led me back out into the open. Isa was standing there. He said... that we should practice an act together. That we would perform inside. And you did? Yes. Somersaults. We were able to fly. Are you... Are you going to the funeral? I don't think so. Perhaps, I'm not sure. Let's go to your place, okay? Why? My stuff... Hey. How's things? Do you remember me? Yes, I do, sure. How's things? Do you live around here? Yes. Just a couple of streets down. - Do you come here often? - No. Do you still work at... No, no. Not for six months. Do you still know anyone there? I'm looking for work. Yes, let me write something down for you. You can contact this person. - You can write it on here. - Got a pen? No. I've got one. Maybe don't mention my name. That might be better. Oh, yeah? - Can you read that? - Yeah. Thanks. See you. Do you want... What? Do you want to go to my place? I want to pick up my things. Be quick. I'm not coming back. Why not? Drop the key in the letterbox. I don't think she understands me. But I don't know what's better. To be understood or not to be understood That's not at all clear to me. First, she didn't understand why I didn't make a decision. Now, she doesn't understand that I made a decision. She doesn't understand at all that time has passed since then. And anyway, how are we supposed to live? At some stage she'll want me to pay. But for what? Can you answer that? Perhaps for thinking that I couldn't live without her. If I had lived without her, it wouldn't have killed me either. I mean, the moment the final bill is presented, you'd be well over the torment of your sacrifice. If you had in fact lived without her. What are you reading? "A memory from my childhood. "I allowed my little sister to toboggan down the hill, "without thinking that she wouldn't be able to steer around the iron railing. "The result was a deep gash on her forehead. "It was stitched up and I got a thrashing." "Carlton was looking at the front gardens..." "the birds and the women." "The birds and the women. "Suddenly, he realised "that he would never be able to comprehend it all. "He asked me for a cigarette and said goodbye." Hi, same time tomorrow? - It's David and... what's your name? - Eve. And Evie. Tomorrow the same time. Okay, see you, then. Bye. I'm going to the studio. Should I take David with me? The food is ready. See you later. Take off your coat. You're staying, okay? What's going on with you two? Nothing, we can eat without him. - Are you two not happy? - And you, are you? Piece of advice. Make a decision while you still can. Otherwise you'll get dragged in so far that you can't do anything. You can't think and then randomly an intelligent thought hits you. Then all that will be without your input. What is without my input? I mean, you quickly lose control over your own life. What is that? Did you two agree on a strategy? Emperor's Mess. - Strategy... how? - Why emperor? Your advice to me. I don't know. It's for emperors only. Why do you eat it then? - Because there are no more emperors. - A king? Neither. - What then? - Nobody relevant. Eat. If he says the same thing as I, it may be because. We don't have to coordinate strategy any more. The one knows what the other one is thinking. Most of the time, anyway. Now and then, there's a misunderstanding. Like before, that was one. Then again, it wasn't, really. He wants to work at the studio. It's an odd thing, you know. Whenever I've to decide something, I automatically know our two positions. What he would think and what I think. My decision is a little blurred, in the end. Half his, half mine. That's us, after all. Doesn't that get on your nerves? No, why? Sounds terrible. Because you don't understand anything. Isabel wants to move in with me. When? When did you ask her? Yesterday? At what time? Why do you want to know? I didn't pay attention to the time. Approximately, then? At nine. At nine, I was at the cinema. It was 9 in the morning. So, does she agree? Yes. How did you spend the day? We brought in the plants, from the porch to the stairwell. Because it's gotten so cold. I made coffee. While she worked some more on her translation. Then, I had a dentist appointment. From there, I went to the print shop. I then went back to her place, but she wasn't there any more. The telephone rang a few times, nothing important. Then I called you, to meet with you. And then she returned, with a new scarf. It was dark by then. It's me, can you come down? Come down, we have to talk. Are you here for the flat, too? I'll take it, I'm serious. Bye. Do you want to come up? I'm not sure. Got a cigarette? When did you make this one? Do you want one? I forgot to ask when you will be moving out. I have to give notice on my place, too - I'll call you. - Fine. It's cold, let's go up. Does Mum know you two are moving in together? No, how could she? And the others? Does everyone know now? I have no idea. I won't be able to visit any more. I don't want you to visit me either. Are we going to meet somewhere else? I want to know now, tell me, where will we meet? Or do you prefer if we don't see one another any more? No. I see. And if I need to know something, will you reply? If I need to I can just ask, right? You haven't asked me anything in a long time. - That's not true. - Yes, it is. You're not sincere when you do. Of course I am, you force me to ask. You two say, "It's like this," everything has been decided. That makes me ask questions, since I can't make any decisions. - Nobody asks me. - I'm going nuts. Do you love Christian? Yes. Did you tell him? I don't know, yes. Then ask me! Ask me whether I love him. Your glasses are fogged up. You're getting too close to the stew. It's not the stew, it's cold outside. Take them off. It will clear up by itself. Take them off. Take a sip. No. Would you like a different glass? I don't drink in the afternoon. There's something you still have to do, and it could go wrong. - Chicken. - I beg your pardon? You can put your glasses back on. They suit you. There's much more that suits me. - What are you doing today? - Nothing in particular. Why don't you work? I am, I'm looking for a model. For this tender. German photographers portray France. A French girl? No, someone local. - Tell me. - A pregnant woman. It's a photo story. Well, two photo stories to be precise. But there's no proper ending. A pregnant woman is travelling in France. The first photo... saying goodbye to her family. And then pictures of her trip, in the car. In town squares, taking in the sights, et cetera. Parallel to that, a young servant girl, younger than the woman, she is always in the same place. She works at an estate north of Paris. Then, on each page, a picture of the woman and, next to it or below, a picture of the girl. Then, on the final page, the woman driving through a village. She sees the girl coming out of a bakery. The girl sees the woman driving past. - And that's that... - Yes. Do you understand? I guess. We see the servant girl at work? Yes, her day is completely regimented, while the woman does whatever she fancies. But not for much longer, or why is she supposed to be pregnant? You disagree with that? Did you find a pregnant woman who'll go on a trip with you? I haven't found one I like yet. You think it's crap. Perhaps I don't understand it. Properly. Perhaps I'd have to see it. Why are you looking at me like that? What if you didn't like it? Then what? Don't you see that you judge people by what they produce? - And you don't? - I don't I don't believe you. - You know that exactly. - No. Richard. Where are you headed? To pick up David. Where is Christian? Haven't you seen him? Not much lately. You look beautiful, are you happy? What? Are you still together? Didn't the thing with the coin toss help? What? I told him to toss a coin, because he couldn't decide. And? And what? What was the outcome? I don't know, he didn't tell me. So, you don't know what you're talking about. I wanted to see Richard. He's not here any more. Why not any more? His pictures are gone and his things, too, almost all of it. - Did he leave a note? - No. And who are you? He rents out half the studio to me. But just half of it I don't know how to pay for it all if he doesn't turn up again. - Are you a friend of his? - Yes. He has mail. And also, his cat keeps hanging around. - May I come in? - Sure. He left the clothes rack and the mattress. Doesn't look like he'll come back. What's your name? Patricia. The cat doesn't eat beans I noticed. Doesn't talk to just anyone, either. Do you want to take the letter, too? Listen, what am I supposed if he doesn't turn up? Why, what do you want to do? A friend of mine is looking for a studio. It's too big just for me. Well, you're not going to do anything for now. - Oh yeah? - See you. - That's my brother. - Any more relatives anywhere? No, it's just us two in the entire world. I can't picture how you live now. I can picture my own life, not yours. You got a cat? Not mine. Where does she shit, did you make something for her? Has she already shit somewhere? Don't you have a shoe box? Christian, how are you living now? Without you. I do pretty much the same stuff as before. I don't understand any of the people I see day in day out... How many people does one see in a day? In the streets. In cafés, at the park. Hundreds. I don't understand that I never see you, I can't comprehend it. I have a proposal. I'll sleep here tonight and you go to Isabel. You can give that back to her, I finished it. And this is for you two. Leonard Cohen. I listen to it a lot. I'm heading off now. Were you going to her anyway? I'm sorry. It's a total dump and then they ask you to pay for it. Richard is gone. Gone, how? He moved out. Out of Nina's place? Moved out of the studio and out of Nina's place. I didn't know. Since when? Two weeks ago. Do you know why? No. - He told you nothing? - No! - That, with the studio, is odd. - Why? To just take all his things. Otherwise it wouldn't be odd? I don't know, he has nowhere to work now. Or did he leave Berlin all together? Looks like it, at least. - In that case. - In that case, what? He'll have his reasons. Actually, why do I have to pay? Because you're trying to dump something. Okay, the plates. What's going on, are you upset? Where are you going? Was it something I said? It's fine. - Do you envy him? - What? Do you envy him, that he can just leave like that? Where is Nina? She's asleep. Do you know where he is? No, I don't. Do you? I don't know anything at all. What happened? Nothing. Nothing. Are his things still here? No note, nothing? No. I heard Isabel is moving in with you? Correct. Well, now. Right? So, how did you decide? I mean... I know what you mean. I tossed a coin. You're crazy. It's sickening. If you see Richard. You can tell him that I was no longer in love with him. He left before I had the opportunity to tell him. But I'm not relieved. - Were you at the studio? - Yes. Was there a letter? You can give to me, I wrote it. Or do you want to read it? "Brotherly heart! "I come to you like the dewy morning. "Open yourself like tender blossoms. "You receive a sky. "The happiness of golden cloud "Trickles down with swift gentle sounds. "Friend! "I know not myself. "I know not the human. "And now the spirit of all ideas is ashamed. "To grasp them too is what he sought. "As he grasps the earth's affairs. "To grasp. "But vertigo seized him sweetly "And the eternal castle "Of his thoughts falls down." How much time do you have? Enough if you start talking to us. Why me? What do you want to drink? What is the difference between Isabel and me? I don't understand. What's not to understand? How we differ, you should know that. I don't know much about you two any more. Well, then, what do you remember? I wasn't certain that you loved me. You loved Isabel very much. Can you only talk about yourself? I'm talking about you. And with Isabel you were certain? I'd say so. But that's not what I meant. You've always demanded things from others, Isabel demands only from herself. Are you serious? That's not all. - Don't you love me? - I do! Then how can you say something like that? Maybe I misunderstood you. - When? - What? Just now or always? Ari, what's the matter? Why is talking to you impossible? Because you can't! I've been talking all day long! And I asked you something just now I asked you a question. Why do you love Isa more than me? I don't get it. What are you talking about, why would you say that? I'm moving in with Christian. Do you want to come home with me? I want you to explain it to me! I'm sorry. Talk to me! Why don't you leave now? Don't you see that it's meaningless? I can see that. Your hair is longer. Mum, are you happy? Have you got a good life on your own? What's odd is that, when I think of you, I think of someone leaving. Leaving their men, I mean. I suppose it's different for you. I mean, to be able to decide against someone. You must have decided in their favour first. Before you said no, you must have said yes first, but, for me, you're not someone coming, but someone leaving. Leaving the first one, leaving the second one. At first with one child, then with two I consoled Ari, because I knew what was going on. We took so many cabs, do you remember? You in the front, us two in the back. Why did you never even get your licence? Mum. Are you happy? I'm anxious. That's why I'm only happy sometimes. You blame me for all this? No, but I don't want to be blamed either. You taught me that there is no such thing as guilt in these matters. That things turn out as they should. I taught you that? No? Not that I know of. Oh, Mum. You don't want to be responsible, but I'm not holding you responsible. That's quite like you. You reduce someone to nothing and then you tell them, "It doesn't matter that you're nothing." Let's have a cigarette. No. I reject how you're doing things. I'm beginning to dislike you. - Hi. - Hi. How long have you been here? Half an hour. Ari is here. Yes. She's sleeping. Should we let her sleep? She's drunk. When did she get here? Earlier today. - When? - A few hours ago. And what's that? Her supplies. For how long? What? How long does she want to stay? Ask her. How long are you planning to stay? What time is it? It's late. Aren't you feeling well? - How long have you two been home? - Aren't you feeling well!? Did I throw up? Did she throw up? How would I know? I'm fine. Then get up, I'll drive you home. No. Are you pregnant? Where's my hair tie? Throw her out, she's lost her mind. What do you want to do now? I don't understand. Well, what is it you want to do now? Why me? Why me? Again? Don't you have a girlfriend? Sure. I didn't mean to pry. It seems that getting photographed gets one to talking. Especially if you're not used to it. To talk? No, to be photographed. - Do you do this often? - What? Strike up conversations with pregnant women you don't know. No. You're the first. It just came over me when I saw you. Do you think I'm pretty? Yes, I think you are pretty. - And that's it? - That's it. Shall we get a coffee? Yesterday there was a letter. What letter? From Isabel. Yes? What does it say? It's for you. I didn't see it. I have it on me. Do you want to read it? Of course. Can I read it? Read it to me. It didn't arrive yesterday. It came a week ago. From where? Lyon. Her father lives in Lyon. "Dear Christian, "I've been in France for one week. "It's a little as if time had stopped here. "Perhaps because everything is so natural. "Life in the streets, and how I move within it. "It was never like that in Berlin. "Not one day felt natural, lately. "I thought it was the exact opposite. "The usual run is natural and what's different is exhausting. "That doesn't appear to be correct. "Our usual run was a heap of shit. "I'm considering looking for a flat. "It would be good to know a time, "to know a certain time when one knows what one is going to do. "It would be good to know a time... "to know a certain time when one knows what one is going to do." Do you understand that? Is there more? "I think of you." "I think that I'm 32. "And that I would like to love someone else." "Sometimes I feel like throwing up here. "I want you to see how I throw up. "I want you to see how I shop and how I brush my teeth." "Send my regards to my sister." "Isabel." - Has she called? - No. Really, she hasn't.
