Are you... you like that? Smile, you're on camera! Yeah! You're a star now. You're gonna love it! Wayne. Wayne. Wayne. How do you feel today, Wayne? I feel better, Dr. Yates. Ready to leave. You know, we've been working together for some time now. Every time you and I talk, we get a little deeper. You remember a new detail you can let go of. You think I let go of it? Is that what you think? Huh? Dr. Yates, it's impossible... impossible to stop hating them. To not want to hurt them like they hurt me. I'm trying to let it go. I am. But pouring over it with you again and again is not helping me. Maybe it's time you knew a little more about me. Did you know I, too, was bullied when I was your age. I thought these people who I counted as my friends were trying to kill me. They almost did. What happened? I was humiliated. And a video was made of that humiliation and everyone I knew saw it. So you see, you and I aren't so different, are we? You've made progress. Remarkable progress. You were very much a danger to yourself when you arrived here. And after that, you were a danger to others. Now, I believe you're well past such violent episodes. Hey, guys, it's Julie Miles, and I'm hoping you can get me - to 500,000 followers today. - What up! So if you don't know my crew on InstaTalk, I figured I'd introduce you to them. So we can help get them to 500K too. Take my friend Beth here. - Hey, Beth. - Hey, guys. - Hey! - Hey, Beth. So in third grade, she was the new kid on the block. And had a total loner and outsider vibe. At least... - until she grew those. - That's my girl! - Way to go, girl! - Let's use those knockers! And then, suddenly, she was very popular. Oh, see my friend Darrin here? Sup, everybody? What's goin' on - What up! - What's up, Darrin? I taught him everything he knows! Now, he used to be so just quiet and shy. Then he got a growth spurt, started working out, learned how to throw a football, and it was as if Bell Fountain's own superman had just dropped from the sky. Ew. That's gross. And then, that's Aiko. Hey, Aiko, girl! Hey, chica, what's up? I like your hair. And this is Albert. Hey! What's up? And thanks to InstaTalk, he has gone global with his teen angst, and will do anything for, well, anybody's attention. - Thank you. - Al, you crazy man. - The dude is nuts. - Meanwhile, my boyfriend, - Jeremy... - Hey, Babe. That's my boy! A protégé. Right now, all the attention is on... - Tabitha! - That's my boo. She's the newest member to our crew, and really, my personal favorite, aside from Jeremy, of course. - Love you, babe. - Good save. She was the first in our school to reach over 500,000 followers. - Stop! - And now is at just a million. I mean, it's cool! But so I could tell you all my friends and I are way different from what we post on our InstaTalk pages. I like to think there are pieces of the real us there. Maybe you can spot 'em. I like to think you can. But maybe this is what it's all about. A connection that we can believe in. A link to the rest of humanity that can ultimately lead us back to ourselves. So I'll tell you what, boys. If you can get me to 500,000 followers in the next minute... I'll make out with Tabitha here. Find a homeless person. Give them an iPhone. Let them make an account right now. Follow, subscribe. I need this. You're gonna break 500K! Tabs, let's give them what they want. Psych! Oh, my God! Just stop following 'em. Stop.. Hey, superstar. I wanna come over. Well, you can't. I'm studying. Okay, well, your last InstaTalk moment doesn't lie. Oh, come on. You know those are completely necessary in my continued survival. True, but why should Tabs get all the fun? She still there? - Nope. - I'm on my way. My parents are gonna be gone for three weeks. Can you wait until their plane takes off? Who waits? We're the I WIN generation. - The what? - The I Want It Now generation. Did you come up with that all by yourself? Yes, but you can have it. Where are they goin', anyway? On an ashram. An assram? They paid thousands of dollars to go huddle inside of a frozen mountain in India. It's supposed to lead to a spiritual awakening. So why can't I come over? SATs headass. I'm studying! How are you my girlfriend? - Jeremy! - Come on. You know I'm kidding! I just can't get enough of you. You will always be the all-star quarterback I fell in love with in ninth grade. But I gotta go. Okay? I'll see you tomorrow? Fine, but check IT. Sending you something. Oh, what'd you send me? - You'll see. - Okay. Bye. Oh, Albert, your cries for views are just getting weirder and weirder. It's okay. It's okay. Whatever you need. Just please... Oh, my God. Uh, Tabitha, uh, I, I saw this video from Albert. - I got it too. - Do you think it was real? Holy shit, it looked real. I don't know. But I'm freaking out! You're freaking out? I'm home alone. I'm coming over. - Okay. - Okay. I gotta do one thing and I'll be right there. Hey! Howdy, neighbor. Howdy? Oh, Jesus, are you trying to get me... Ow! Julie! - What the hell? - Fuck you! That wasn't funny! - Asshole! - What? What's wrong? Hey, seriously, what's up? Albert's latest masterpiece? It's disgusting. What? This is the link I sent you. What's up with Albert? I think he's just messing around, but... this video, it wasn't like the others. Well, show me. Oh, the signal here blows. Here, Tabby was in that moment too. Let's go, okay? - Come on. - All right. I'm going to make a Darrin sundae. And how are you gonna do that? Well, first, I'm gonna cover you in chocolate sauce. I'm gonna put cherries on your nipples. And sprinkles down your treasure trail. Then you're gonna lick it all off? I'm sending you to college, baby. I'm gonna take off all my clothes and rub myself up and down your entire body until... Mm-hmm? You provide the whip cream. Oh, baby, I always said you were good in the kitchen. I'm great in every room. Um, I have to go. Are you gonna stay on? I was gonna stay up and do some IT, and then go to bed, but I'll wait if you want to play with me. Darrin? What the fuck? Hey, babe. Is everything okay? No, I've been trying to call you. Oh, fuck, I'm so sorry, Tabby. I need you to come over. Now? Is everything okay? It's Albert. We got a video. Is it the doggy threesome rim job? - That video is sick, dude. - Okay, this isn't funny. Can you just please come over? All right. Yeah. I'll be right there. - Hey. - I'm freaking out. Hey. So what's going on? - It's Albert. Someone killed... - It's Albert, this video, - and there's blood... - ...right through his eye... One at a time, okay? Did you check his InstaTalk? He's not even logged on. - Should we call him? - Call him? - Be serious. - This is an emergency. We need to call him! Losers leave messages. Straight to voicemail. His phone is off. - His phone's off? - Relax, okay? Uh, let's, let's look at the video. Never seen pussy do that before. That's not the video. What we saw was Albert and his head was being pushed down. He obviously just killed the moment - once he knew you guys saw it. - No. What was his last IT post? Uh, the last thing I can see is Albert's heading to Viva Taco - at 2:00 p.m. - Something's not right. He updates this thing every time he farts. OMG, guys! Albert's dead, he's really dead, isn't he? Hey, what's going on here, Tabitha? Not a good time, Peter. - He's dead. - Who's dead? - He's dead. - Who's dead? Someone sent us a video on InstaTalk as a moment. It was of Albert getting stabbed in the face. Yeah, right. Let me see this. - You can't. The moment's passed. - What moment? When a user posts a video on InstaTalk as a moment, it's over when they say it is. We can't get it back, but we know what we saw, Dad. - He's dead. - Okay, Beth. It's okay. - I got you. - Guys, it's just Albert looking for clout. He hasn't had a hit for a while, so his user numbers have really leveled off. It's not him happy slapping a homeless man, or crapping in a water fountain, okay? I think I know what's going on here. I think this Albert's having a little fun at the girls' expense. It's not like that, Peter. Okay, stop calling me Peter. It's Dad. And I think this Albert is just trying to get a little attention for his pitiful sense of self-worth. He does that by posting these practical jokes as videos. I've seen his type before. Believe me. Now, your parents are probably worried. I think you should go home. Okay. Don't slam the door. Bye, babe. All right. Uh, Beth. Wait a sec. Look, I'm sorry for what that kid did to you. - I know how boys can be. - Mm-hmm. Um, if you just need someone to talk to, I'm a pretty good listener, and my phone's always on. Thanks, Tabitha's dad. Yeah. Ew. I want to talk to you. Hey, I'm gonna go be with Tabby, okay? All right. Sounds good. - Hey. - Yeah? What the hell was that all about? That was nothing. I for real think Al's in some kind of trouble, though, guys. Beth, it's Albert. It's obviously a gag. Well, then, I'm staying with you tonight. Absolutely not. - Really? - Yeah. Really. Then maybe I should go back inside with Tabby. Fine. - Drop me off at home first? - Get in. Wayne? Wayne? Hey, wait. Wait! Hey, I, I just wanna talk. Wait! Yeah, no, we should take a cycling class next week. - Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. - I'm about to hit it. Three point five miles! - Oh, my God. - Suck on that, bitches. - This is my friend, Julie. - Hi! - All right, guys. I'm gonna go. - Bye! So I heard you and Peter arguing. Do you wanna talk about it? He's an asshole. End of story. What did he say? He says he doesn't want me seeing Darrin. 'Cause he's going to college. He doesn't like any of my friends. Except you. - He loves you. - Well, what's not to like? He said he doesn't believe us about the video. And now that we've moved here from the city, nothing bad can happen, which is bullshit. Nothing's creepier than a suburb, gorgeous. I love you, Julie. I feel like you're my only real friend. Uh, actually, you have over a million friends, - last time I checked. - Yeah, Tabitha as titbait. No, I like it. All those people that I'm connected to but will never meet. As I suffer through their fucking vacation photos, and their cat videos, and their filtered selfies. Their bullshit photos that they hide behind to try to prove that they're living their best lives, when in reality, they're just as miserable as the rest of us. It reminds me that I have you. And that our connection is real. I treasure it. - You know what? I'm sweaty. - I don't care. - It's really not a good look. - I don't care. - I love you. - I love you too. Hey! Oh, my God. It's just me. Today's word is discretion. I know it's a little bigger than you're used to, but you should look it up! I could have been you know who. - How'd you even find us? - Find a Friend app, moron. All us girls are on it. And by the way, I didn't see you on IT at all last night, where were you? - I'm on a digital cleanse. - What happened? - Hmm, eat me, asshole. - You wish. I wish you would fall off. I went out with Jim. I let him kiss me. It tasted like Burger King. Kissing boys is so gross. I don't know what you see in it. Yeah, Beth, you freak. I was talking to you, man whore. I was really drunk at that party, okay? And I told you that in confidence. Oh, my God. Who cares. It wasn't even like that. Oh, my fuck. Who cares? Albert can be in real trouble. - That video? - So nasty. Yo, what's good? - Hey, is that him? - No, it's Jeremy. Well, tell him to get his ass over here. Can you get me a mocha? Hewitt's out of Sunnybrook. Wayne Hewitt? Two days ago. I hacked their site. Your nurse fetish's got you searchin' mental hospitals now? No, dipshit. I saw him last night. What? Where? When you dropped me off, I saw him at my house. I didn't get too close, but I'm pretty sure it was him. - Okay, so... - Think about it. Hewitt gets out. Albert gets a tool in his eye. Is there any chance you were stoned during this phantom encounter? Would you listen to me? I know what I saw, Darrin. Oh, just like you saw David Bowie at IHOP - the day after he died, right? - Funny, dick. Just get your ass over to Skyjacks, okay? Aiko wants all of us together. - Fine. - All right. Later. My mocha! Oh, sweet. Thanks. Thank you. So, what the fuck are we doin' here? Ask these two. Just tell us why the fuck we're here. Albert's been missing for like 24 hours now. - Can we worry yet? - Oh, my God. Not you too? I don't know, man. What if it's not a joke? What if Wayne Hewitt saw Albert's post about goin' to Viva Taco, and went, and you know. No, no, there's absolutely no way that Wayne Hewitt - killed Albert, okay? - But anyone else could have? - What? - How many people - are you connected to now? - On InstaTalk? A hundred thousand or so. I don't keep track. Exactly. And these are all people you met in kindergarten? No, most of them are total strangers. So? So if you're one of those douches stupid enough to post everything you do on social, which you are, and then you let them know everything there's to know about you, which you do, how hard is it for some random psycho to find out where you are, where you're going, and when you're alone and going to Viva Taco? - It could be anyone. - Hey. You're being paranoid. - It's not that serious, dude. - Hey. - Hey. I want to go. - Where are you going? It was a long night. I need a little stress relief. Oh, gotcha. Oh, don't forget, my house, tomorrow, and it is a pool party, okay? So if anybody is thinking about showing up dressed like Billie Eilish, don't. I assume that's directed at me, so yeah, go fuck yourself. Oh. Hey. What's up with Julie? You two used to be tight. Used to be is right. - Hi, Sheriff Willard. - Hi, Aiko. How's everyone doing? Enjoying the last days of summer? Lovin' it. Jeremy, may I have a word with you, please? I'm just drinkin' coffee. Now! I thought we understood each other. You can be difficult to understand. I, I don't speak pig. Listen, I can only imagine how hard this is. Football star, scholarship. And now what? You can't let that injury define you. There are other paths. You were a winner. Oh, yeah? What am I now? Just... limit your activities here today to just purchases. What was that all about? I don't know. That guy's got it out for me. Whatever, Takeshi. Tell him, Julie. Oh, um, the InstaTalk user on Albert's video. It's 91418. Nine, one, four, eighteen. September 14, 2018. That's when it happened. It's fucked, right? Beth, did you notice who sent you that Albert clip? - Darrin has some goddamn nerve. - Beth, focus! He acts like I'm not even here. - You wanna go? You ready? - I just started my coffee! Just bring it with you. We'll see you guys later, cool? You guys suck. See ya. Genius, have you forgotten, if Julie finds out about you and Darrin she'll go straight to Tabitcha? Whatever! How could he do this to me? Beth, Tabitha is easily the hottest girl in Bell Fountain since Ariana Grande's limo broke down on the freeway. He's not gonna dump her for you. And what's so wrong with me? Oh, my God! Just treat it already. - You're being pathetic. - I'm not pathetic. - Take that back. - Please. The way he runs your ass and the way he lets you? You're totally tragic. Oh, I am not pathetic! - What was that? - I don't know. Sorry. Cannabis Central closed at 4:19 today, so. Sorry, okay? This has never happened before. Oh, my God. I just cannot stop thinking about Albert. You were thinking about Albert? That's not what I meant. Are you crying? Darrin, I had this boyfriend when I moved here. We dated for a year before I found out... he was fucking half the school. Everybody knew. It really messed me up. I went to therapy. Tabitha, I love you. Okay, I would never, ever do anything like that to you. Now, maybe you should just go home. I need to chill out for a little bit. Are you gonna be on IT later? Yeah. - Okay, I guess. - All right. Too needy. Too demanding. Hmm. Too lame. Honey, I'm leaving! Please get to bed on time. - Thanks, Mom. - Pizza delivery is on its way. - Bye! - Thanks, Mom. Have fun! Mom? Mom? I don't think Albert would go on torturing us like this though. Well, you haven't known him for as long as we have. Remember the ManQuest thing, Jer? - Oh, yeah. - ManQuest? Yeah, Al's debut as a cyber terrorist was signing Jeremy up for a gay dating service. Yeah, I broke a few hearts that month. I still get emails of naked dudes like once a week And you're not sharing this because...? Well, then I get contacted by a long-lost sister my parents gave up for adoption when they were teens. You didn't fall for that, did you? I took a bus to the Garfield Monument and waited for hours until he texted me with, "Gotcha." It was when InstaTalk became a thing that his star began to shine. It was the first time he ever really applied himself, and he was really, you know, legit building a brand off of really clever prank content. Videos of kids finding roadkill on their doorstep isn't clever. No, it wasn't always that extreme. It was... Never mind. No. What? - Aiko. - Wait. What? Aiko. - Aiko? - Yep. He wanted Aiko since the first day of puberty. And she was all about his content. You know Ai, she loves that shit. And he loved her. Still does, I think. So it was like he started doing it more for her than himself. He was posting all the time, creating moments. - Growing a following. - Then Aiko met this YouTuber, Jenny, she had some crazy amount of followers. And they hooked up and Albert kinda became second best. And that's when the pranks got dark. - Because he was hurt? - Fuck, no. Because the more brutal they were, the more people watched them, and liked them, and all that shit. And in his head, the only way he could show his value to Aiko was by increasing the eyeballs and becoming greater than... whatever Jenny was. And he did that. But... by that time, Aiko was already all in. Okay, did no one tell him that Aiko was like - fully lesbianic? - Right? Doesn't matter. He was so lost in InstaTalk, and his new fans, and he really believed that whatever sort of persona he could create online was the key to winning Aiko. And the content got more intense until... Until what? Hey, did you guys get that? Yeah, looks like a video. Yeah, I got it too. This should be good. Care to go for a swim, anyone? Maybe we shouldn't open it. As if. It's probably just her lip syncing No Tears Left to Cry, or a selfie montage. - What the hell is that? - Holy sh... - Shit! - Dude, that's Aiko! Oh, my God! Why am I here? I didn't do anything. Because your phone was found at the scene of a crime. Don't touch me. I thought you said I wasn't under arrest. Miss Hogart, we just need to ask you - a few more questions. - Take your hands off me. - Rape! Rape! - Go inside, please! Dr. Forest, dial 182, please. Sheriff. Take a seat. What brings you by? We're... not exactly on your usual rounds here. A young man escaped from here recently. And he has some connection to a young woman that was just murdered. Yes, I saw the news reports. It's terrible. But I can't imagine Wayne Hewitt would have anything to do with something like this. I assume that is who you're asking about. I'm just chasing down any lead that I can get. Then you haven't got any. Doc, why are kids today so casual about telling the whole world, total strangers, what they are up to at any given moment? I mean, it all just seems to be so goddamn stupid. I can stop you there, Sheriff. I mean, look at your first response to this. Anger. These are just children. And the world we've given them tells them that... validation, or even self-worth, is to be found in the likes and clicks of strangers on their smartphones. So what am I supposed to do? Take their phones away from them? We both know you couldn't do that even if you wanted to. I'm trying to monitor the situation. And help these kids in the way I know how. Wait. You're monitoring them? Everyone's throwing up their lives for the whole world to see. I'm just looking in the doors that have been left open. - You'll see. - I hope you're right. Me too. Do you think she did it? What could Beth do to someone? Tit fuck them to death? It's Wayne Hewitt. I'd bet my left nut on it. The swollen one? No, thanks. Dude, don't you remember this guy? Hewitt was a king dork, okay? He couldn't take Julie down, let alone Albert, and definitely not Aiko. Can't drag him into this until we know for sure. It'll just make everything worse. - Come on, come on! - You with me? Shit! Goddamn clown. Are you playing Carnival Killers right now? Jesus, Jeremy! Can you get your head into what's happening to us for 1.5! You have no idea where my head's at! - Forgive me for trying to relax. - You can relax at my party. Your party? Dude, one of your best friends was murdered last night. - You have to cancel it. - Are you out of your mind? Even if I wanted to, which I don't, my parents are back in three days. - Cancelling is not an option. - Well, that's gross. Obviously, I'll be there. Perfect. Perfect. Hey, I gotta go. I'll see you at my house? It's gonna be epic, dude. You do not want to miss this. Where are you, Wayne? Who is it? It's me, Jer. Let me in. Hey! What's up? "What's up"? I'm totally freaking out. I'm staying with you until my parents get back. No! No. Um, I mean, sure, but let... you know, let's go to Darrin's party. - Can I change first? - Just change at the party. - We'll... Yeah... - What is going on with you? Nothin'. I just think Darrin and Tabby are already there, so. So what did the cops ask you? They asked me why I didn't show up at Aiko's place with you guys. I mean, duh, I lost my cellphone. How was I supposed to know something happened? Yeah. You should have seen the way they looked at me, Darrin. As if! Hey. No, no, no, no, no. Hey, hey, hey. It's fine. It's okay. It's gonna be all right. Okay? It's not that big a deal. It's gonna be fine. Oh. - No. No. No. No. - Oh, my God, Darrin. - I love you so much. - No, you don't. - Let's go back to my place. - No! Okay. There's a full party going on at my house right now, okay? You can't keep doing this to me. I need you, Darrin. Whenever you've wanted or needed anything, I mean anything, I've done it. What's that creepy little bitch ever done? Do not talk about her like that. Who the hell is she, anyway? One day you're all mine, and the next day, a U-Haul pulls up, Tabitha slithers out, and then you just toss me aside like garbage. I mean, you don't even know her. - I know I love her. - Right. Except for Monday, Wednesday, and Friday when you're drilling me, right? Now, let's go. - Hey! - You look so hot. Darrin's been looking for you. He's over there. Oh, okay. Woo! Party! I love this song! This party couldn't be worse if we were under quarantine. Do you think there's been another outbreak? I mean, I don't even see the host here. Did someone die or something? Like... - Oh, yeah. - Yeah. Someone did die. You guys seen Julie? - No. - I don't even know anyone here. - Do you wanna take a selfie? - Yeah, sure. There you are. Oh, my God. Kenzie, hey! I've been meaning to um, you know, reach out. Julie, Aiko's memorial service is in 30 minutes. And you're here, at a party. What the hell is wrong with you? - Well, what are you doing here? - I came to find you! I saw your IT post, and I thought I could try - and talk some sense into you. - Do you know where Darrin is? - No! - What the fuck's your problem? My problem? My problems ended the day I emancipated my ass - from you bitches. - Who the fuck are you? You never even mentioned me. I was you. Until Albert spiked my Vitamin Water with Ex-Lax, stuck his camera under my stall, and streamed it as a moment. I told you this would end badly, Julie! I fucking told you! Calm down, Kenzie. Whatever. You know what? Enjoy your fucking party. What the hell was that? Where the hell is Darrin? How is he not even at his own party? I don't know! It's weird. I'm texting him. I'm sure he's fine. Yeah. So are you guys gonna drink, - or... - Yeah. Yeah. Yes, can you please make me one? Sure. You're so not old enough to be here. Well. Bye, guys. You are so mean! - Where is he? - Give it a rest. - You give it a rest! - Would you two just stop? Stop what? I didn't do anything! Oh, really? Then why does everyone seem to know something - that I don't? - What? I'm serious. I mean, you both have been acting so sus lately, and obviously keeping shit from me. Like, who was that girl? And Darrin? Darrin's like a whole 'nother person. What the hell, you guys? Look, Tabs, this is all my fault. Okay? We are keeping something from you. - Julie! - Forget it, Jeremy. This has gone on long enough, and you know it! Oh, they're having a bad day. Are you good? Why are they yelling? Let's go somewhere private. Come on. Wait. Wait, wait. Wait. - Stop! - What the hell, Darrin? - Listen to me! - What the fuck? - What's up? - Look. I care about you. Okay? We've had a lot of fun. But I don't wanna do this anymore. I don't know how much more obvious I could possibly be. What the fuck are you doing, Darrin? What the fuck? What the fuck? You're so pathetic. Woo-hoo! Yeah! Go! All right! Okay, so there's this kid named Wayne Hewitt. And you've never met him because he's been in a mental hospital since we did something terrible to him. - Care to take over? - Fine. Albert had always picked on Wayne. When Wayne got to Bell High his freshman year, he dodged Al like he had the Coronavirus. Al wouldn't have it. Kept talking about this masterpiece, and how Wayne was gonna be the star. So one night, Darrin made Beth call Wayne over to her place... - Why'd Beth listen to Darrin? - Do you wanna hear this? She called Wayne over, and... we grabbed him. We took him to this place Albert knew about. Some abandoned property outside of town. Darrin and I were there, shooting live on our phones. Albert, he was running the show Streaming the whole thing live as an InstaTalk moment. It was a real production. I mean, he even had a drone. And everyone was watching Albert's prank video masterpiece. People were betting on how long it would take Wayne to crack. Which he did. I didn't do anything. Stop. Stop! I didn't do anything. Stop! And then it got to this place where it just wasn't cool anymore. Boo! Albert crossed a line. Smile, you're on camera! I don't think he ever looked back. Streaming the whole thing live as an InstaTalk moment, and everyone was watching. So you guys hate crimed an LGBTQ person of color. What century are you in to think that that was okay? It was all Albert's idea. Maybe because Aiko went gay on him. That excuse is pathetic. - So what happened next? - The police got involved. We all convinced Aiko to convince Albert to take the fall for it. He still loved her, and it was his stupid idea anyway. The moment had passed, and there wasn't really any proof. So you throw Albert under the bus, and he gets off because this is America. Meanwhile, the victim gets institutionalized. And do you sociopaths even feel a tinge of guilt here? Whatever. Karma's a bitch. And two months later, I blow out my knee. - Lost my scholarship. - Poor fucking you, Jeremy. Of course, we feel bad, okay? We made a pact never to tell anyone about what we did. Or about Wayne. And so how is he now? He escaped from Sunnybrook. I can't believe you never told me any of this. I mean, I'm in actual danger just knowing you. Okay. There's still no proof that it's Wayne. You terrorized this kid so much that he was committed to a nuthouse! And now, he's out, and people are dying! - What more proof do you need? - Okay, sure. But Wayne obviously wants to talk, so let's give him a chance to come forward before we go sounding any alarms. Look, we've done so much to this kid. Before we go on a witch hunt, we need to make sure it's him. Right? Well, it's been fun. But I have some shit to do. Tell Darrin he's an ass for missing his own party. Hey, where are you going? I'm staying with you, right? You should stay with Tabitha. Actually, you two stay together. I'm out. It's your fault she knows. And now you have to make sure she doesn't do anything stupid. - Tabitha, wait! - You know I have a hard time - trusting people. - I should have told you. What did he mean about Darrin making Beth - call that kid to her place? - Back then, Beth and Darrin had this friends with benefits thing going on. But look, she wound up obsessed with him, and he dumped her. It's ancient history. Really? Or is there something else you're not telling me? Whoa, Tabby. I shouldn't have kept this Hewitt thing from you, but I would tell you if Darrin was messing around on you. I would. Look, Darrin is not that asshole you were with before you came here, okay? He worships you. He's really vain, and you're the hottest girl ever. Shut up. Look at me. You've been through some real shit. You can believe me when I tell you Darrin is not cheating on you. Okay? Can I have a hug. - Yeah. - Oh. - I hate you, Julie. - I love you more. Beth. Hey. Yes, Daddy. Yes, Daddy. Oh, my God, Daddy. Yeah. Call me Daddy. Call me Daddy again. Yeah, Daddy. Yeah, Daddy. Oh, that was incredible. I gotta go. I gotta go. Really? You know, like, maybe we should, should we talk about this? Can I, can I call you sometime? Talk about it. Um... Uh, thanks. "Thanks"? Hey, sexy. I got your text. Peter. Peter? Peter? Peter? Peter! Darrin's all tied up at the moment. Hello? Hello? Where am I? Aw, shit. Where am I? Is anybody there? Hello? Hello? Who's there? Where am I? Help me! Help me! Oh, my God. Did I do it right? - No, I didn't. - Oh, my God. Oh, we got a moment. Welcome to the death of Beth. - Help me! - Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God! Who sent this? Uh... It says it's coming from Darrin. Here, I can find him on my Find a Friend app. Let's go. Come on! Tabitha? Tabitha, what was that? I heard a loud bang. Tabitha? Hello, Peter. Who's there? Sit down. I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna call the police. - Call me Daddy again. - Yeah, Daddy. Yeah, Daddy. To use a reference more age appropriate for you than Beth, can you hear me now? With a single keystroke, your new InstaTalk page goes live along with the moment you have fantasized about for years How was it... Daddy? You don't know a damn thing about me. I actually know quite a bit. When was the last time you deleted your browser history? How about deleting your cookies For a man who was fully cognitive when the internet went mainstream, you sure have been sloppy. Oh, God. How about the stuff you downloaded from that Venezuelan porn site? Oh, please God. When your InstaTalk page goes live, everyone you know will now know you as this man. All the data, all leads back to you. Please, stop. Are you sure she was 18? I mean, what do you want from me? The questions I'd be asking are who took that video of me fucking Beth? And did they leave? - You think she's dead? - I don't know. - What is this place? - I'm not sure. But wait. Wait, I think I recognize that. Would you pay attention to the app? - Which way? - Up here. Make a right. Should be just up ahead. Pull over. Okay. - Darrin? - Darrin? Whoa. Your boyfriend's been a naughty boy. - After everything I told you? - No, I didn't know. I didn't... Wait! Tabby! Please, please! You have to believe me, I didn't know! Why? Why should I? You lie about everything! No, not this, okay? I wouldn't. - Is that blood? - Oh, my God. - Open the trunk. - Um... Oh, my God! Beth! Oh, my God! - Tabitha! Tabitha, wait! - Fuck you! I'm dropping you off at your boyfriend's. You two deserve each other. Leave a message. Jeremy, something really bad happened. You need to call me. Tabby ran off, and left me here. Jeremy, please call me back. I'm at your house. You gotta be kidding me. Don't move! Julie. Oh, shit. - Honey. - Who the hell are you, Jeremy? Do I even know you anymore? I needed it. It's for my knee. You needed it? There's a shitload of baggies there, and a fucking scale! Do you think I'm an idiot? - You're overreacting. - Overreacting? You had a gun to my face, asshole! Where did you even get that thing? I got it at a gun show. Actually, I got two of them because of the shit going on. What are you even doing here? Beth is dead. What? How? Tabby and I found her body in the trunk of Darrin's car. Where's Tabitha now? I don't know. She hates me. Beth and Darrin have been screwing this entire time. Can you believe that? Did you know? You knew, and you didn't tell me? - You would have told Tabitha. - Yeah. That's kind of the whole point! God! I came here because I don't have anywhere else to go. What am I supposed to do now? Stay with me. All right? It's safe. It's okay. - Get away from me. - No, no. We, we'll be safe. I'll sleep on the floor. Fine. It's okay, come on. Let's go back to the house. Don't touch me. Come on. Come on. Come on. Oh, yeah. Whew! Oh! You hear that, Darrin? Oh, Darrin? Shit. Hey, Darrin? It's me, Albert, man. Everything's all right now. Darrin's gone. I, I don't know. He's just gone. What do we do? Dad, please call me back. ASAP. I need you to come home. I love you. Darrin. If you're rushing off for a secret booty call with Beth, I have bad news. It's not a secret anymore. Oh, and Beth's dead. Julie! Hey, Julie. I'm sorry. I'm sorry I freaked out on you at the party. You really don't deserve any of this. It's okay. Everything just got carried away. 'Cause of InstaTalk. I'm supposed to wait to kill you, all part of a little secret plan. Pretty much. Hey. When this is all over, can we please make this right? 'Cause I miss you. I miss you too. I gotta go. Call me. Payback. For when you let me take it in the ass for everything that we did together. You remember that? - Hello? - Julie! You need to come to my house now! I'm freaking out. Okay, I'm coming right now. Hey, what are you doing here? Tabitha? Tabby? Tabitha? Tabitha? Tabitha? Tabitha? Tabitha? Tabitha? Tabitha? - Jeremy? - Hey. You were gone when I woke up. Where are you? Jeremy. Are you okay? I'm at Tabitha's. But she's not here. And... Peter's dead. Jesus! Get out of there. Go to my place, lock yourself in. The gu... The gun is in the nightstand. Don't open the door for anyone. Jeremy. Just go, I'll be there soon. Wait. So, Julie, care to play a game? No! Julie! Don't! - Hey. - Jeremy. I'm locked in the bathroom. Wayne's here and he has a gun. - Please help me! - What? I'm almost there! Julie, please listen to me. I need to find Jeremy. Please, just hear me out. Okay, okay, I'm listening. I met someone online. Good for you. Who hasn't? No, you don't understand! They said that they're coming to kill me. Look, I, I thought it was Albert. I got so scared that I ran away, and I hid. So you hate crimed an LGBTQ person of color. And do you sociopaths even feel a tinge of guilt here? No! No, no, no, no! Don't get any closer! - It's okay. - He said your name. Julie, he was crazy. I was probably next on his list. I'm putting it down, okay? It's me. Okay? It's okay. It's okay. It's just me. I'm here. I'm here. It's okay. Come here. Come here. Shh. It's okay. It's okay. I'm here. We're still looking for your friend. Tabitha. We'll find her. I want to go home. Can we go home now? - Yes. Yes. Go. - Can we please go? I gave the plants away. Yeah, to my cousin. I really did start growing them for the pain in my knee. I wasn't gonna get hooked on meds I couldn't afford. And it helped with the depression, too. So I... made a bunch of extra, and you know, sold what I didn't use. I could pay rent, and be normal. I didn't tell you because... I, I, I can't lose you. You're the last good thing I have left. It's my dad. Julie? - Julie, wait. - Jeremy, go away! If you don't go away I'm gonna call the cops! What the fuck, Julie? Julie! What are you doing? Jesus! What the f... Julie? Julie. Don't leave me. Shut up. If you don't stop being a douche and start drumming up some tears you won't be touching an inch of my body. Got it? - Hey. - What the hell? - Start crying. Cry. - All right. Go back. Stop. All right. I don't know. I feel like this isn't gonna look believable. No, no. Trust me. I'm just gonna punch it afterwards we're gonna light it up, it'll be perfect. Trust me. You just gotta make sure you make good on... ...whatever she actually pays.. No. This doesn't make any sense. Why are you doing this? But I didn't know. Tabitha, please, I love you. Talk to me. Where are you, you crazy bitch? Behind you. Looking for these? Hi, Jules. I know you're listening. You wanted to talk. Well, here I am. You know what I want to talk about? I want to talk about you. And your terrible friends. The kind of people that ruin people like Wayne Hewitt just to make yourselves feel better. You know what the truth is? Anyone can do what you do. Really, trust me. You just starve yourself beautiful. And make a million new friends on InstaTalk. And all of a sudden, all the horrible people that are so mean to everyone, will start eating out of the palm of your hand. You all made it so easy for me to get you exactly where I wanted you. You tell InstaTalk everything. And you believe everything it tells you. It's amazing what you can accomplish with just one stupid little app these days. Hello, gorgeous. Nowhere left to run. Bitch! This ends now, bitch! Hey. Hi, there. My team and I have done all we can for Tabitha. When this stranger approached her on InstaTalk, he proposed a way for her to get revenge on all the people who had hurt her. Well, you know how these creeps operate. She never even met him in person, but saw him as some sort of... a soulmate. Someone who truly understood her. Loved her, even. There's absolutely no way to track down this person? All we have is his sign off. He ends every conversation with an emoji. An eye, a die, like in dice, the roman numeral four, and a sheep. What does that mean? "I die for you." How odd. It is. Doctors. He told her he would reveal himself as soon as she killed all of her friends. As you can see, she's still waiting. Did you know that the corporation that owns this institution pays a fee to InstaTalk's parent company? It lets us access and monitor all the moments and deets InstaTalk uses, they just disappear. I had no idea. We have such power to influence young people's behavior now. Thank you, Dr. Flynn, I'll take it from here. Hello, Tabitha. I'm Dr. Yates. I'm an expert in dealing with young people who've suffered certain humiliations. I know such traumas can seem impossible to let go of. Good luck. She's a handful. I'd die for you. It's you. It's really you. No. Not here. Not now. Soon. Well, when can, when can I get out of here? And we can be together like you promised. Don't you see? We've already been through so much together. When Wayne Hewitt first told me of that terrible group of bullies, and then I saw them drawing you, my sweet Tabitha, into their caustic little clique of attention seekers, we've been working side by side together. I know that we are destined to right many wrongs together. I promised you it would work out. And here we are, together. And we've only just begun. Hey, guys, it's Julie. I just wanted to say thank you for the love I've been getting. All the support and stuff. It's overwhelming to think that so many people I've never met care so much. It's beautiful. It's social media at its best. But just remember, there's another side. A darker side. I've seen it. It can kind of just take over your world until you don't recognize the person in your own selfies. So... I'm out. Okay? If you need to contact me, just email me. And I'm not saying that you, or anyone, should get off InstaTalk. Just don't give too much of yourself away to it. Okay? Because everybody's watching. Your friends, who really miss you, corporations trying to sell you shit. Organizations trying to poison your thoughts. And people who aren't who they say they are. So just be careful, okay? Yeah, so. Bye. You ready? Give me a moment. - I am now. - Good. What do you want to do? - Everything. - Then let's do that.
