General. An unidentified plane is approaching the palace airstrip for a landing. Certainly. You'll have a full report as soon as possible. Will there be any change in the plan? Very well. We attack Belapur tonight and Ghandahar will be next. Thank you, general. Sorry, sir, but you cannot land here. I'm sorry, sir, I have landed here. This is the private field of the Maharaja of Ghandahar. His Highness is expecting me. Oh, I see. My bag. I am your man. Follow me please. Come on. May I see your papers please? And would you kindly open the bag? Steven X. Gibbs. Foreigners are leaving these days. That we understand. Foreigners arriving... Tout d'Amour. You sell this perfume? No, I give it away. Wrong sex. It is against the law to bring firearms into Ghandahar. Well, I thought I'd do a little rabbit hunting while I'm here. There are no rabbits in Ghandahar. Well, maybe I could pull a few out of a hat. Your gun will be returned to you when you leave. How long do you plan to stay? I'm leaving as soon as I see the maharaja. The maharaja? He says His Highness is expecting him. Why didn't you tell me? Come with me please. I will take you into the palace. Good deal. Come on, son. I will wait, sahib. Mr. Singh will be in shortly. How do you do, Mr. Gibbs? Well, how do you do? Please be seated. Thank you. You seem to be under the impression that you have an appointment with the maharaja. Cigarette? No, thank you. Do you mind if I smoke? Not at all. Thank you. When do I get to see His Highness? I am in charge of all his appointments, both real and imaginary. Well, you can't shoot a guy for trying. What is your business, Mr. Gibbs? Insurance. Insurance? Life insurance. Just the kind Your Highness needs very badly right now. Please go on. I've just flown in 20 machine guns, 200 rifles and 100,000 rounds of ammunition. What makes you think we can use such an arsenal? Two things: the British army's moved out and Nawab Khan and his guerillas are waiting in the hills to move him. Whom do you represent? Steven X. Gibbs. Are you by any chance connected with the American government? Oh, no, no. I'm strictly on my own. My firm is Hashim Garrabin Company, Bombay. I'm the company. I'm afraid you have made a long trip in vain. We are not in the market for guns. But you ought to be. You're about to be attacked. What are you going to fight them with? Not with bullets. They settle nothing. Except who wins or who loses. In war, nobody wins. Look, I'm not selling you war. I'm selling you defense. Mr. Gibbs, I had every hope that I could contain the tribesmen without violence. We were in the midst of peaceful negotiations. They have been watching me to see if I made any false move. And Mr. Gibbs, you may have made that false move for me. Just by coming here. Relax, Mr. Singh, I haven't got a press agent. Nobody knows what I brought in my plane. In this part of the world, men can see what is hidden. They can hear what has not yet been said. Mr. Singh-- Tell me, you did not by any chance bring any medical supplies in your plane? Streptomycin. Penicillin. No, but I wish I had. But right now I'm selling guns. We are not interested in your guns. Well, in that case, I guess I'll have to sell them to somebody else. Nawab Kahn perhaps. You know, I-- I never thought about that. Good afternoon, Mr. Gibbs. Look, Mr. Singh, what's a good time to see His Highness? Good-bye, Mr. Gibbs. I'll be seeing you. Give me the airstrip. I want the cargo of Mr. Gibbs' plane confiscated. And load it at once and keep it under seal until further notice. Sahib, here is your gun. It may be useful, sahib. Well, you're gonna be pretty useful yourself. I am your man. What's your name? Moti Lal. Moti Lal. Where di you get this scar? I fight. Fight? Yes, sahib. You ever win? I have one scar. My enemy has many. You know all the answers, don't you? Yes, sahib. Okay, then. Tell me, what do you know about a man named Nawab Khan? Didn't you hear what I said? Yes, sahib. I thought you knew all the answers. This one I do not know, sahib. Bags to Morrison. Goodbye. I hate to go, but after all. Not me. I'm glad to go. And I advise all of you to leave before the trouble starts. From what I hear, there's going to be plenty. Everything will be all right. Good bye, dear. Goodbye, Alvin. Goodbye, Mrs. Carmichael. Hope I see you in London. Goodbye. We're going To see Matilda May We're going To see Matilda May We're going To see Matilda May And take one how do you do? Good morning, sire. You got a nice room with a bath? Uh, we have several nice rooms without a bath. I need a bath more than I need a room. If you don't mean waiting a few minutes, a nice room with a nice bath will be vacated. That's fine. Uh, if you'd be good enough to register. What the devil are you doing? I'm sorry, Sir Henry. We have orders to take down the sign. Listen, everybody. They've taken our sign down. You consider that a major disaster? Why, this parlor has been exclusively British since the hotel was built in 1881. But, Sir Henry, this is 1947. Look at this. Look! A genuine Kashan silk prayer rug. Nothing in my collection to compare with it. Hello, my dear. Picked it up for a mere trifle. You have no idea how prices have come down. What's up? We've practically been evicted. Evicted? They've taken our sign. I've been listening to some of you talk like this for weeks. And you might as well get this into your heads. Things have changed. And if you want to stay here, you have to change too. Ah, good heavens, Joan! We belong here. Yes, if you're willing to accept the changed conditions. It's their country, and we're just guests here. And the sooner we realize it, the better. Atta-girl. That's telling 'em. Thank you, whoever you are. Thank you. You're welcome. Sahib. You're room is ready. Oh fine. Come in. What is it? Oh, monsieur, forgive me. Oh, that's perfectly all right. Oh, I could come back later. Oh, no. Stick around. I'll be out in a second. Okay. What can I do for you? Monsieur. Monsieur. You can save my life. What are you dying of? You the man who gives this money by plane. The name is Gibbs. My name is Lizette Damon. Your neighbor. Neighbor? I'm staying at the hotel. Glad to know you, neighbor. Monsieur Gibbs, you can be my good angel. Oh? You have just the wings I need. Oh. You're checking out. That's my greatest need. I must somehow get to Bombay at once. What can you get in Bombay that you can't get here? I have a good friend in Bombay. How good? Mr. Rollins, the American consul. He's my guardian. I talked to him only on the phone this morning. He's very worried about conditions here. He urged me to leave at the first opportunity. And you want to hitch a ride in my plane? Alors! You've said it. Might be. It's possible? Could be. Moti Lal. Yes, sahib. We're out of cigarettes. Run down and get a carton. Yes, sahib. Would you do something for me? If I can. Scratch my back. When do you plan to leave? Couple of days. Mm. Feels good. A little more to the left. Here? Further up. Ah. Ah. Uh, you know, you've got to understand. I'm in business. No free rides. But of course. Unfortunately, my funds are tied up. You know how those banks are. I've been waiting for my money for days, and it does not come, but, naturally, I'll pay for my fare in Bombay. C.O.D.? "C.O.D." What is that? Collect on delivery. That is it, monsieur. Oh, it is, huh? Oh, Tout d'Amour. Yeah, I never travel without it. That's my favorite too. May I? Sure. Thank you. Mm. You know I have a partner. He's a very strict businessman. I don't think he'd like this C.O.D. With him, it's P.I.A. "P.I.A."? Pay in advance. Oh. Well, I guess I'll have to raise the money somehow. I'm afraid so. It's a commercial plane. Would tonight be soon enough? Certainly. Here. With my compliments. Why, thank you. You're most generous. See you tonight? Au revoir, monsieur. For you, Charlie. Oh, thank you, sahib. You can tell me where I can locate Nawab Khan. What the matter with everybody around here? Forget it. Good evening, Mr. Gibbs. I don't suppose you remember me. Oh, you're the girl you told off those fuddy-duddies this morning. They're not really fuddy-duddies. Everybody's a bit edgy. We've been under quite a tension. But it was rude to slam the door in your face. Oh, well. Have a drink? Thank you. What are you having? Well, I asked for Scotch, but it tastes like kerosene. Oh, one kerosene and soda please. Really, Mr. Gibbs. You've committed a grave social error enquiring after that man. Heh, heh. Don't you know that Nawab Khan is a bad word around Ghandahar? As far as I'm concerned, Ghandahar is a bad word. Well, you don't seem to like the whiskey, you don't seem to like our town. Forgive me for intruding. Oh, no. Please. Have your drink. Cigarette? Thanks. I hope you don't find me too forward. I was only trying to be a committee of one to welcome the stranger in our midst. And to thank you for applauding me this morning. I'm very fond of applause and I must-- What happened? The lights went out. ...does not see very well. What he means, Mr. Gibbs, I'm as blind as a bat. Oh, I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. I had no idea. But you don't act a bit like-- Like a bat? Heh. Oh, it's silly, but I like to fool people. Especially new people. Thanks for the drink, Mr. Gibbs. But you haven't touched it. I think I ought to be starting for home. May I--? May I get you a tonga? Oh, no. It isn't far. And I like to walk. Besides, my maid is waiting for me. Good night, Mr. Gibbs. Do you mind if I... walk with you a way? No, of course not. Tayhi. I've just heard from the power house at Belapur. The think it's sabotage. I should have told you about those cobblestones. They're very tricky here. You know you're terrific? All you need is practice. Someone to give you a hand. My grandfather deserves all the credit. Mind if I give you a little credit? Well, maybe a good mark for effort. What can one do? Sit in a corner and cry one's eyes out? You can't just give up, can you? Right in the middle of a promising career. Career? Didn't I tell you? I'm a professional guide. I show tourists the teeming life of Ghandahar. The highways and the by ways, the shops and the bazaars. Walk up, walk up. Right across the street to your right is the establishment of Nitra Putra. You see it? The one with the blue awning. Care to drop in and buy a souvenir for your wife? Or your girlfriend? That's an idea, but I'll need some help. Well, I can't be much help unless I know something about her. Or you. About me? I can tell you that in four words. I fly for money. Heh, heh. That's what I call a rich, full, colorful description of a man's life. Could you spare a few of the lurid details off the record? Well, I was a couple of years in ??? with Chennault. Flying tigers, how thrilling. How did you come to join them? The pay was higher. Heh. Come on. Heaven born. Hello, Charlie. What have you got? I have jewels, moon stones and sapphires. ??? and ???. Sandalwood boxes. A beautiful bracelet for your lady. Ah, let's see. Maybe she'd like a ring. Good, a ring. Ah-hah. Ah-hah. The most precious. It was once in the maharaja's collection. I cannot bear to part with it. How much? I know Miss Willoughby. I sometimes attend her grandfather's church. I wish no profit. The ring cost me 500 rupees. Sold. Wait. Take it for 400 rupees. The finest of jade. In these uncertain times, one must make sacrifices. Three hundred rupees. Sold. She wants my very blood. Fifty rupees. One hundred rupees. Fifty. Heaven born, take it as a gift for 100 rupees. Fifty. Impossible. Come along, Mr. Gibbs. Sahib. Take it for 50. Sold. You must admit I drive a hard bargain. Just a minute. For my lady friend. Oh, no. You musn't. I-- Uh. I couldn't. Please. Thank you... so much. Say, how did you know that awning was blue? Oh, I saw it when I was 10. It was the most beautiful blue. It still is. What is that? Oh, that's the maharaja's car. Wait here for me. Be right back. Your Highness, my name is Gibbs. Steve Gibbs! Is he hurt? No. How do you like that? All I did was introduced myself. I was knocked flat on my-- My opening remark. Well, one doesn't jump on the running board to meet the maharaja. One doesn't meet the maharaja at all without seeing Ram Singh. That crackpot? He's the maharaja's right arm. Also his eyes and his ears, sometimes his heart. Well, sure isn't his brains. I know His Highness quite well. Perhaps I can arrange an appointment for you. Baby-- I mean Miss... No, baby. I like it. Oh, if you can fix that up for me, you can name your own price. Oh, don't be rash, Mr. Gibbs. No, I mean it. Well, you may not be able to meet my terms. Sky's the limit. Well, brace yourself. You don't know what you're in for. What? A picnic. Huh? If I arrange an appointment for you, you have to take me on a picnic. You know, sandwiches and potato salad and ants. Plenty of ants. Sold. But, uh, supposing you can't make that appointment? Well, then, I'll have to take you on a picnic. When do you think you can talk to His Highness? Soon. You're a wonderful dancer, Miss Willoughby. Practice, Mr. Gibbs. Practice, a gramophone, and Grandfather. Oh no. Please don't. Don't what? Feel sorry for me. Really, it's not too bad. It's fun meeting people, and figuring out what they look like. What do I look like? Your face is... good. Mr. Steven Gibbs? That's me. I am Azam Habib, a broker. What's on your mind? Twenty machine guns. Two hundred rifles. A hundred thousand rounds of ammunition. For a client of mine. Would you mind telling me your client's name? My client prefers not to have his identity revealed. Would it be convenient to call on you tomorrow about noon? I guess so. When can you deliver the merchandise? Any time you want. Good. I will take possession tomorrow. Hey. Don't you think we ought to agree on a price before... before you take delivery? We will agree on a price. Hey. What are you doing here? I am your man. Sure. Sure. But that doesn't make you my roommate does it? It is the custom. What about your parents? Won't they be worried? I have no parents, Sahab. Where do you live? Here. Do you snore? No, sahab. Okay. Oh, thank you! Sahab? Yeah? When you employ a man, it is the custom to discuss the matter of wages. How much is it the custom to pay? I would be happy if you gave me your gun. And I'd be very unhappy to part with it. Perhaps you will leave it to me in your will. You got a deal, kid. But I'm not figuring on kicking off for some time. I will wait, Sahab. Hello. This is Joan. Mr. Gibbs, I've got some bad news for you. You're going to take me on a picnic. When? Right after you you've seen the Maharajah. The Maha-- I've arranged an appointment for you at eleven in the morning. Oh, baby. Hey, how about you being my manager? It's well worth considering. I'll take it up with my grandfather. Grandfather? I would like you to meet him. It's Mr. Gibbs. How do you do, Mr. Gibbs? Hello, Mr. Willoughby. I've been hearing a great deal about you. Mr. Gibbs, it occurred to me that perhaps you'd like to attend services at my church on Sunday. Church? Uh... sure. Sure. Mr. Willoughby. That is, if I'm here on Sunday. Oh, I do hope so, Mr. Gibbs. With all this exodus going on, attendence has dropped-- It's me again. I do think it's shameful the way Grandfather pounces on every new arrival. I've got the picnic all planned. It's the most beautiful place. Little island in the middle of a lake. Do you like deviled eggs? Oh... I'm mad about deviled eggs. I'll do hundreds. Wait'll you see the basket I'm planning. It'll have everything including pickles and a gramophone. I'll bring the ants. Splendid. Oh, by the way... what's the color of your eyes? Why... kinda blue? Something like that awning. I knew it. Good night. Good night, Joan. Good night, Steve. Hussy. I know it. What is wrong, Sahab? Nothing. Look at the fire. What's the name of that town over there? Belapur. If you have to find Newah Khan, he is there now burning the city. I did not expect the attack on Belapur last night. I suggest that you communicate with your British High Commissioner in New Delhi. And arrange for a convoy. Convoy? Why should we have to leave here by convoy? Why should we have to leave at all? I couldn't possibly leave without my rugs. Those who wish to remain, will have to do so at their own risk. Get in touch with the rest of the British residents. Well, since I have no intention of leaving, Miss Simone can have my place in the convoy. Oh please. I'm very grateful for your kindness, but I've made other arrangements. I am sure you can settle all those details with the High Commissioner. Give me one regiment and I'll settle it myself. Sir Henry, I do not share your faith in regiments. Well then how are you prepared to guarantee our safety? Unfortunately, I have no way of doing that. Then there is no point in wasting any more time. Good day. Claudia. Joan, please do think it over. I'm not afraid, Ram. We'll be all right. Good bye, Mr. Singh. Good bye, Doctor. I know how busy you have been-- Not too busy to telegraph Bombay. And the visa? It will be issued. If I can vouch for you. I realize we met for the first time yesterday, and you know about me only what I told you, but do you have any more questions? One or two. Please, do sit down. Perhaps my friend, the American counsel, might want some further details about the purpose of your trip to America. What shall I say? Well... it's just that I would like to settle down. What if, in America, you do not find what you are looking for? I'll just have to keep on looking. Yes, Your Highness? Ram, can you spare a moment? Certainly, Your Highness. I'm afraid the Maharajah's idea of a moment is quite vague. I will dictate the letter this afternoon, and send it to your hotel. I would be happy to call for it myself. If it would not inconvenience you. Not at all. Thank you so much. Au revoir Monsieur. Good morning, Your Highness. Hi. Good morning, Mr. Gibbs. My dear friend, have you had breakfast? Hours ago, thank you. He thinks I get up too late. Most difficult man. Sit down, old chap. Ram... you know that I never interfere with you. But don't you think you're being hasty in refusing to do business with our friend? Your Highness, I've been thinking the matter over. Good. The more I think about it, the more I am convinced that it would be bad business. See what I mean? A stubborn man. Implaccable. Dear boy, how can I persuade you? Why not tell him? You're the boss. Only when Ram isn't around, and he's always around. None of you are going to be around much longer if Newah attacks Ghandahar. My friends, the British, never took him seriously. Is that why they paid him off every year? I wanted to pay him off also, but you wouldn't let me. Never should have let you overrule me. You told me those blighters didn't hate me. You said they'd stop fighting. It is not hatred that makes them fight. It is fear. And those who are the most frightened, are the ones who commit the greatest violence. If they should learn that we are arming against them-- There we go again. What Mr. Singh is trying to say-- I know what Singh is trying to say, but it's a lot of bilge. Everybody knows those birds are gunning for you, and if you don't gun back-- Mr. Gibbs has only one interest. And that is to sell his guns. I'm sorry Your Highness, but I'm fed up with this jabberwocky. If you're not interested in my proposition, somebody else is. We're aware of that. That is why I thought it best to impound your cargo. You what? I have confiscated your guns. Stop your clowing, Singh. You know there is a law against bringing weapons into Ghandahar. You were informed of it when you arrived. Hello. It's for Mr. Singh, Your Highness. Hello. Yes, put it through. You will be given a receipt for your cargo. It will be returned to you at our expense. Yes? I see. What is it, Ram? The bus that left yesterday, was attacked on the road. No one was spared. I saw that bus leave the hotel. There were women and children on it. The kids were singing as the bus pulled out. Nice work, Singh. You can send that receipt to the hotel. Most unfortunate about the bus, but at any rate, we have the guns. I can leave with a clear conscience now. You are planning a trip, Your Highness? Didn't I tell you? I thought a few weeks on the Riviera. I've not been feeling ver well lately. My sinus. I understand, Your Highness. I hope you have a speedy recovery. Get the hangar. Have my plane tuned up. What in the world kept you? Where's the driver? I couldn't find a driver who would leave Ghandahar, for love or money. Oh, Corbett, you're not going to be frightened away by a bonfire. See that. There they go. Heaven knows where. And we're going too. You'd better leave too. Cheerio. Bye everyone. Bye. I must leave you after today. Oh, what happened, Tayhi? My mother has been taken very ill. I understand. I'm very sorry, Tayhi. We've been together for so long. I shall miss you very much. I'm not happy to go. I'll go. Hi. Hi. Steve. Have you seen the Maharajah? I just left him. How did you make out? I shouldn't have come here. The way things look now, this is a place to get out of and fast. Yes. We had a conference with Ram Singh. There's some talk of a convoy. There won't be time for a convoy. Or a picnic. I know. We're leaving by plane for Bombay. We? Um hmm. You and I and your grandfather. I can't. Why? I'm afraid. Of what? Bombay. Oh, come, now, Joan, you're not afraid of anything. Why should Bombay frighten you? I know, Steve. To you, it's just another city, but to me... it could be like... like a new planet. I was born here. I've never been anywhere else. I'd have to start all over. I'd be helpless again. I couldn't bear that. I know. But you wouldn't have to stay in Bombay. When things quiet down around here, you could come back. I'll bring you back. You'll bring...? You will? Promise. When do you think you'll leave? Tonight. Oh, Steve, I-- Now, you start getting packed. But what about the others? Would there be room in the plane for some of them? Now, look, Joan, I... Sure. Why not? There's plenty of room. They've been whistling in the dark, but some of them are terribly worried. You come on and get ready. I will. Where's your grandfather? At the church. Will you get a hold of him right away? Have him round up everybody else. Arrange a meeting at 4:00 at the hotel. I'll gas up my plane and come back for you. And we'll have that picnic on the plane. Steve. You're terrific. You go on in. I'll be right there. Mr. Habib. My name is not Habib. Well, if you run into this Habib, tell him that cargo of mine he was interested in is-- You have no cargo. News travels fast around here, doesn't it? Quite. The Maharajah's plane. His highness decided quite suddenly to go to the Riviera for the winter. Sir Gibbs, the French lady has been looking for you. Where is she? In her room. Tell her to start packing. Yes, sir. Good afternoon, everybody. Good afternoon. Come in, Steve. I understand some of you people are interested in getting transportation out of Ghandahar. As Mr. Singh suggested, we've just put in a call to New Delhi to arrange for a convoy. Want to listen to lullabies or can you stand a few facts? I believe Mr. Singh gave us all the facts. Did he tell you why the bus that left yesterday never reached Nurban? It was attacked. There were no survivors. The Morrisons. That's fact number one. Fact number two. The Maharajah just left in his plane, heading south. Fact number three. I'm pulling out myself for Bombay. But I can handle some passengers. When do you plan to leave? 7:00 tonight. Well, that's rather short notice, isn't it? This time tomorrow, Ghandahar's liable to be a butcher shop. How many people can your plane accommodate? Twenty in a pinch. A tight pinch. Well, what about luggage? My rugs? Rugs? No rugs, no luggage. Just passengers. May I ask what your fare is to Bombay? A thousand rupees. But that's double the usual rate. Costs a lot of money to fly my plane here. And as far as I'm concerned, this is a round trip. Can't you see Mr. Gibbs is joking? I never joke about money. I'm a commercial pilot. That's how I make my living. You ought to be ashamed. Downright thievery. Taking advantage. No better than Khan. That just sent the rate up to 2,000 rupees. Sir Henry, I cannot get New Delhi. All telephone and telegraph lines outside Ghandahar have been cut. Well, that's good news for you, isn't it, Gibbs? It means your plane's the only way to get out. A really enterprising swindler could possibly get as high as 10,000 rupees. Thanks for the tip. I'll take it. The rate is now 10,000 rupees. Gibbs, you're a blackmailing scoundrel. Cash, in advance. But no extra charge for calling me names. Oh, go to the devil. My plane leaves at 7:00 sharp. Take it or leave it. Naturally, Joan, that doesn't go for you or your grandfather. Joan. Joan. Don't touch me. I'm all right. I'm all right. We're checking out. Pack my stuff. Sir... I am not your man. The clock is five minutes slow. Where are the bellboys? They have all gone. Come on, Frenchy. You've both been so very kind. You're leaving? Yes, on Monsieur Gibbs' plane. Don't you think his rate is rather high? Oh, but I'm going as his guest. Let's go, Frenchy. Yes, ch?ri. Goodbye, Miss Willoughby. Miss Simone? Yes? Yes, Miss Willoughby? A little present. Thank you. I wish you a safe journey. Thank you. Joan... Please. To the airstrip. That's the Corbetts' parrot. Have the Corbetts come back? No, child. Henry, we've got to get out of here. But, Claudia, how? In a tonga? There's still Mr. Gibbs' plane. Are you suggesting we submit to the blackmail of that scoundrel? Yes, Henry, yes, please. Blackmail or not, it's the only way left to get out. In any event, it's too late. No, it isn't. Ahbek. Ahbek, get me Mr. Singh at the palace. Ahbek? Ahbek ran away. Gone. Gone? Yes, ma'am. Oh. Moti Lal, help me, please. Yes, ma'am. Get me Mr. Singh at the palace, quickly. Seven-seven-nine. I'm leaving at 7:00, and I won't wait a second. I'll be there, ch?ri. Hi, Charlie. Sorry, sir. Nobody's permitted to enter the plane. What do you mean? This is my plane. Yes, but I have orders from Singh. Oh. Nice guy, Singh. But I thought he had strict rules against carrying guns. That does not apply to his highness' private police. Oh? Cigarette? I am not permitted to smoke while on duty. Okay. Take this letter directly on your typewriter. Yes, sir. I am ready. Mr. John Rollins, American Consulate, Bombay. My dear Rollins. This will introduce you to my friend Miss Lizette Simone. I assure you there is ample time. But the plane is leaving at 7:00, and Monsieur Gibbs said he won't wait one second. The plane will not leave until the other passengers have arrived. Oh, I didn't know there were going to be other passengers. Neither did Mr. Gibbs. Please do sit down. My good friend Miss Simone wishes to visit your country, and for this purpose requires a visa. Miss Simone is a lady whose charm and beauty are exceeded only by her good character, for which... I have the honor to vouch. Oh, monsieur. With kindest regards, sincerely, your friend. That's all. Bring this right in. Monsieur... I'll try to live up to... the beautiful lies you have just written. It is not a lie, Miss Simone. You are the kindest person I have ever known. Oh, thank you. Monsieur Singh, what are you going to do? About what? When the plane departs, there will be no other way to leave Ghandahar. For a while, perhaps. Could it be possible that you too might be a passenger? I would like very much to be a passenger, but my place is here. Monsieur, you're a brave man. No. I am a very frightened man. Monsieur... I want to... Leaving without me? Pig! Come on! Cochon! Get away, fast! Is he hurt? No, he's all right. God moves in mysterious ways, his wonders to perform. For years I have been trying to entice you into my church, but I've never been able to get more than one or two of you. Now, by an act of providence, I have you all at my mercy. But I'll not take advantage of it. I won't inflict a sermon on you. Why not? Why don't you preach a funeral sermon for the people on the bus and the Corbetts and for us? Joan? You're all going to die because one blackguard wanted to make some money out of you. Preach about that. Perhaps you'll make a convert. Joan, stop it. Mr. Gibbs, I have just been informed that you used force to get your plane. Didn't think I was going to let you confiscate it, did you? I was merely holding it until the other passengers arrived. Don't look now, but your halo's showing. I regret that the guard found it necessary to shoot at your tire. I'm afraid it will not be safe for any of you to return to the hotel. The palace seems to be the only refuge available. I beg of you to be my guests until the emergency is over. Of course, Mr. Gibbs, that includes you. These men will show you to your rooms. Will the gentlemen please remain a moment? Gentlemen, the tribesmen are in Kandahar. They're getting close. That means we're next. Do you suppose they'll attack the palace? Who knows? Well, even if they do, we're not entirely helpless. Far from it. There are some factors in our favor. Why, between us and the palace guards-- Most of the guards have deserted. That's a break. At least we won't get shot in the back. Well, as a matter of fact we're well situated for the fence. There's only one approach to the palace, and that's from the front. What about the airstrip? No, they can't possibly reach it, except through the palace grounds. They can't get through if we concentrate our fire in that direction. With the proper gunpower, we-- What can you give us, Singh, in the way of arms? I'm afraid there are none I can put at your disposal. That's not true, Singh. I came here with a planeload of guns and ammunition. He's got it stashed someplace. I have no intention of using it. Oh, you think they won't attack. I know I won't resist. Are you trying to say you intend to surrender the palace without a fight? The palace is nothing. Mortar and stones. Dust. I'm not concerned with buildings. But all we ask is a chance to defend ourselves. Surely you can't deny us that. I cannot permit machine guns to be turned against my own people, or any people. So that's what you're going to do with your newly won precious freedom. Sure, hand it over on a silver platter to those tribesmen. We will ask them to share it. It took us 200 years of struggle, but we finally got our freedom without firing a bullet. Perhaps it will take another 200 years before we can find peace. In the meantime we're going to sit here and be butchered like sheep. It's all very well for you to die for your principles, but you can't ask us to die for them. Look, you're wasting your time. Those guns aren't his. They're mine. And I'm throwing them in the kitty for free. Well, where are they? I'm sorry, gentlemen. Those guns will not be used. He's not just a fanatic, he's a lunatic. Who can be sure? Perhaps we all are. Perhaps the whole world's a lunatic. Mr. Gibbs. Would you like to be shown to your quarters? You don't think I want to be caught in this rat trap, do you? I'm getting out. When do you plan to leave? Right now. I wish you well. Never mind that. How about paying me for my plane? Of course. How much? Two hundred thousand rupees, cash. Very well. Paling. Here you are, Mr. Gibbs. I noticed a couple of jeeps on the airstrip. I'd like to buy one. I'd be glad to present you with one. No, thanks. I pay as I go. Thank you. I'm looking for the trophy room. I think it's just here, isn't it? This looks like it. Thank you. Listen, Joan. Listen hard. I just bought a jeep from Singh. I'm getting out. Pleasant journey. I want to take you with me. Thank you, no. Look, I can't guarantee we'll come out alive. We got one chance in maybe 100, but it's better than nothing. I've got a gun and a half a million rupees. What do you say? I'd rather stay with my friends, if you don't mind. What's eating you? Don't you want to live? Not in your kind of world. I'm not asking you to live with me. I'm giving you a chance to survive. You're an expert at that. Look, lay off that piano, will you? This is no time for a concert. Mr. Gibbs, I'm blind but not deaf. What do you know about my world? You've never been in it. It's a jungle. And if you weren't wrapped up in that pink gauze, you'd know it was a free-for-all. Oh, I understand your jungle. So you step on a few toes, hit below the belt. Kick, gouge, anything goes. Sure. That's how you get by. And it's about time somebody put you hip to it. You've done your bit, and I don't thank you for it. Joan. Oh, go on back to sleep. I saw it when I was 10. It was the most beautiful blue. The most beautiful blue. The most beautiful blue. I want to see Newah Khan. Newah Khan. Habib. Boy, am I glad to see you. Permit me to apologize for this man's behavior. That's all right. I like being robbed and kicked around. This ignorant fool has delusions of grandeur. I am Newah Khan, at your service. What are you standing there for? Why don't you get the gentleman a chair. Yes, general. There's your gun. And your money. Sit down. Where exactly were you planning to go? Here to see you. Thank you. I'm honored. And how can I be of service to you? I want a pass to leave Kandahar for me and a few of my friends. I would be most happy to issue them, but they would be of no use to you whatsoever. You and your friends almost certainly would be shot down by snipers before you had a chance to show your passes. I'll take that chance, general. I will not. I can't afford to. If hard came to any one of you, it would be most regrettable. I want no foreigners hurt. Excuse me. I thought the wires were down. Only out of Kandahar. We hope to have everything back to normal in a short time. Can you get long distance? Certainly. I'll pay you 100,000 rupees for one telephone call to Bombay. You're quite welcome to use the telephone free of charge. Whom do you wish to call in Bombay? My partner. For what purpose? To get a plane to pick us up. I see no objection, providing you confine the conversation to just that. Absolutely. If you try to say any more, you'll be cut off. And not by the operator. Now, what is the number you wish to call? Bombay 1-1-3-2-1-5. How many Europeans do you plan to take with you, Mr. Gibbs? All of them. Including General Harrison? Yes. That will leave Ran Singh with 20 machine guns, 200 rifles and 100,000 rounds of ammunition. When you get back to Bombay, you can tell the truth about who is the real aggressor. Bombay. Choose your words carefully. Hello? Azam? This is Gibbs. Hold it. I can't answer any questions. My plane cracked up and I'm stuck here. Bring the other plane to Kandahar right away. Quick. And I mean quick. General, I don't know how to thank you. If there's ever anything I can do for you-- There is something. You can deliver a message for me to Ran Singh. Tell him if he really wants peace, he can have it before there's any more bloodshed. Tell him he has until midnight tonight to come here to discuss terms of settlement. Okay. Been a pleasure meeting you, general. The pleasure is mutual. Can I be of any further service? Oh, yes. There is something. I noticed some prisoners at the Kandahar Hotel. Some saboteurs. Subversive elements. We've taken them into protective custody. Well, among them is a boy named Moti Lal. I'd like to take him to Bombay with me. Of course. See that the prisoner is released to Mr. Gibbs. Yes, Excellency. There's one other thing, one little thing. Something I owe one of your men. Is it okay to pay him off? Certainly. Thank you. Get up! Get up, Habib, and learn patience. Gentlemen, I've just had a good look around. And in my considered opinion we can give an excellent account of ourselves. We have an adequate supply of ammunition, and there's enough food to withstand an indefinite siege. How indefinite, general? Well, if we can hold them off long enough, the news is bound to get out. And then we'll get help. Look here, Thompson, you're supposed to be on guard. Oh, sorry, general. Extraordinary fellow. Well, this will interest you, Paling. There's even a hospital room fully equipped. I know. I removed His Highness's tonsils some years ago. Oh, come on, you chaps. There's no point your standing there. Get back to your stations. Where are you going, my dear? I'm just finding my way about. A bit to the right, Joan. As long as we keep a constant watch they can't possibly take us by surprise. Of course, if they attack in force-- I do not think they will attack at all. What makes you think they won't? We are protected by Mr. Gibbs' machine guns. I'm sure Newah Khan knows we have them. Then you've changed your mind? No, I will not use them. But Newah Khan does not know that. There may be something in that, Sir Henry. Otherwise, why haven't they attacked? There's a car coming. Come on, kid. Mr. Gibbs! We thought you'd been killed. I was. I came back to be buried. Hi. Hello, Joan. Hello. Anybody buy me a drink? Is there any particular reason to celebrate? Plenty. I'm back, and you can put away your pop guns. The war is over. May I ask where you got your information, Mr. Gibbs? Belapur. Newah Khan. He let me put a call through to Bombay. I've arranged to have a plane get here sometime tomorrow. I'm going to fly you all out. I am very grateful for what you've done, Mr. Gibbs. Oh, I have a message for you, Singh. Newah Khan's just as interested in peace as you are, but he's not willing to wait 200 years. He'll talk terms anytime you like, up until midnight. Tonight? Or else. That sounds like an ultimatum. That's what it is. Anyway, he asked me to deliver the message, and I did. But as far as I'm concerned, I wouldn't trust him. What would you suggest? To defend yourself with everything you've got till a plane arrives. Then get out with the rest of us. And desert my people? Be logical, Singh. You can't help them if you're dead. Besides, you can't talk peace with an outlaw. Well, I have until midnight to find out. Suit yourself. Singh, I'm hungry. Come in. Grandfather? Why did you walk out on me? Why? Answer me. I was overcome, Mr. Gibbs. Heroes always affect me that way. I get dizzy. Why, you're Sir Galahad, Horatio at the bridge and Robin Hood all wrapped up into one. A beautiful apple, only there's a worm in it. They don't know, but you and I know that when you left here you were concerned with only one thing: To save your skin. Well, you seem to have succeeded. I don't know what happened, or how you got to Newah Khan, or even if you got to him at all. I don't even know if a plane is really coming tomorrow and I don't care. Ever since we met so much has happened that I want to forget. That I must forget for my own piece of mind. The drink we had together. Our walk down the street. The presents you bought me in the little shop with the blue awning, remember? It's no longer blue. You have really decided to go to Belapur, sir? Newah Khan has decided. How long will you be gone? Newah Khan will decide. Please tell my secretary I want to see him. He has left the palace. Oh. I understand. Perhaps he thinks I no longer need a secretary. Sir, I too wish to leave. Of course. Where will you go? I was born in the hills. I hope you will find peace there. Ran Singh... would you like me to go with you to Belapur? My good friend, I would like your company very much, but this is one journey I must make alone. Then God go with you. There's nothing to worry about. After all, you know, negotiations take time. But it's nearly ten hours since Mr. Singh left. He should never have left. It's my belief he walked into a trap. Baited with an offer of peace and a telephone call to Bombay. What is it? I hope it's Singh. Why, Singh. Forgive me for disturbing you at breakfast. We were worried about you. What happened, Singh? Did you see Newah Khan? Yes. The plane is your only chance to escape alive. Unfortunately, I could not meet Newah Khan's terms. He tried in various ways to persuade me. And finally... he gave me 24 hours to reconsider. Forgive me that... Dr. Paling, will you come with me, please? Certainly. Thank you. God, they cut off his hand. He needs a blood transfusion immediately. If it's okay, doctor, I'd like to give it. Whoever did this had pretty good knowledge of surgery. And a strange way of negotiating peace. Newah Khan doesn't want peace. He wants Mr. Gibbs' machine guns. Why don't you give them to him? You're not using them anyway. True. And I will never use them. But Newah Khan cannot possibly know that. I can't figure it. So you're hipped on the side till you want freedom and peace for your people. But when the chips are down you won't fight for it. To give your hand, what does it get you? Twenty-four hours, Mr. Gibbs. Time for your plane to arrive and get us out of here. I can understand dying. But to give your hand... Why don't you use it to fight with? I am fighting. How can you fight if you don't hit back? Sometimes one wins by losing. Oh, you're crazy, Singh. Are you leaving with us on the plane? I must stay here. And have your other hand chopped off. Thank you, Mr. Gibbs. You know, we are now blood brothers. The machine guns are hidden in the palace. Ran Singh will not use them. And he will not let the English use them. This is very interesting news indeed. You will be well rewarded for your information, if it is correct. We will attack the palace tonight. Yes, general. You will go first with your men to attract their fire. If they do not use the machine guns, we will attack in force. Yes, general. And if one machine gun bullet should be fired at us, you will curse your mother for giving birth to you. Oh, there's nothing out there. I tell you, I saw a shadow. You've been seeing shadows all night. But this one moved. I think it's time for your relief. I'll send Conroy. It did move. Norton? Norton. Mr. Conroy. Where's Mr. Norton? I don't know. Sir Henry asked me to relieve him. Come on. Sir Henry! Sir Henry! I know, Collins. Go back to your post. Cover that room. General. Now, don't leave that door, Conroy. You'll be all right here. Ladies, stay in the common hall. Get to the windows and don't waste bullets. Moti Lal, fetch Dr. Paling. No, go back to your post. Sir Henry, I demand that you cease firing. Are you out of your mind? Paling, get some water. Well, Said, looks as if you gave up your hand for nothing. I do not understand. He gave me 24 hours. Must go and... Oh, no you don't! You're not leaving till you give us those machine guns. Where are they? Where are they? I hear the plane. Come on, come on. Hold it. We're leaving. All of you stay put till I give the word. I'll have the plane taxi as close to the palace as possible. We need to make a rush for it. You're coming with us if I have to drag you on that plane. I would suggest-- You just feed them lead, general, while I light the flares. Come on, Moti Lal. You chaps go back to your posts. Holy cow. He brought the wrong plane. Go back and tell General Harrison there's only room for seven. Yes, sahib. Harrison, sahib. Harrison, sahib. What is it? The wrong plane has come. Gibbs sahib says there will be room for only seven people. What are you going to do? It's quite obvious. I'm not leaving. Child, please, you must. You-- Where to? And with whom? We'd better hurry, ma'am sahib. Will you take a message to Mr. Gibbs? Well, aren't you leaving, ma'am sahib? Tell him to take good care of himself in the jungle. Yes, ma'am sahib. And tell him the awning is still blue. Yes, ma'am sahib. God bless you, monsieur. The plane may be able to come back for us. We still have a chance if you will just let us have those machine guns. I wish I could, Sir Henry, but if I did, my whole life would be a lie. Singh, this is no time for-- Please try to understand. We are a tiny state. Not very important to India or to the rest of the world, but how we conduct ourselves, what we do here, is very important. Even if we fail. I know I've been betrayed, but I-- I'm-- I must try everything. I must. Newah Khan. Singh! Newah Khan! Dr. Paling! Dr. Paling! He's dead. Where's Miss Willoughby? She's not coming. But she sent a message. What is it? She says take good care of yourself in the jungle. And she says the awning is still blue. Get in, son. No! I am not a woman. Hurry up! Okay. Take off! What about you? I've got business here. Have you lost your mind? Try to get us some help. Get going! Thompson? Why do you suppose they've stopped firing? I don't know, but I don't like it. We'd better be prepared for anything. General. There has been nothing but rifle fire. They're not using machine guns. No, they are not. But I won't need help. We will give you the palace very soon. Thank you, General. Joan. Joan. What? You didn't leave. I couldn't. I couldn't leave without you. Oh, Steve! Come with me. Please. Mr. Gibbs, why did you come back? Mr. Willoughby. I'd like to marry your granddaughter. Well, I... Will you marry us? Will I..? All right, Joan? Please, grandfather. Singh, will you witness this? Will you... Steven? Will you, Steven, take Joan to be your lawful wedded wife, to love and to cherish in joy and sorrow, in health and sickness, in prosperity and adversity, so long as you both shall live? I do. Do you, Joan, take Steven to be your lawful wedded husband, to love and to cherish in joy and sorrow, in health and sickness, in prosperity and adversity, so long as you both shall live? I do. I now pronounce you man and wife. Whom God has joined together, let no man put asunder. Amen. Gibbs? Here's your gun. It's yours Moti Lal, I willed it to you. Thank you. It may come in handy a couple of hundred years from now. Where are we going? To ask for help. Help? They're going to batter down the front door. Everybody, cover the front entrance. Blow out that lamp. It's okay, baby. Singh. Dr. Paling! Dr Paling! Dr. Paling!
