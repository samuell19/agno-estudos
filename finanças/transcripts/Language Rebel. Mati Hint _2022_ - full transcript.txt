Great personalities are born and leave exactly at the right time. I Mati Hint's case, he departed on the very day the Year of Estonian Language concluded. How symbolically he managed to leave. The Year of Estonian Language ended, as well as a man's life. We haven't given enough merit to our great people. In history, in their time, and later. What characterizes Mati, is that would be understatement to say he had no pink glasses, he had definitely black ones. And that was an inseparable feature of his character. So for him, a glass was not only half empty, it was almost completely empty. And even if there was something in the glass, it would become empty very soon. It is inevitable, the glass will be empty, no way to avoid it. His phrase was: "Lose any hope." LANGUAGE REBEL MATI HINT When a change of paradigm takes place in science, but the theory of phonology is a change of paradigm, you can't go on with old terminology, you have to set it aside. It's like with the flat Earth theory. I have explained that. If you go for a theory of spherical Earth, you can no more describe the dome of sky coming so close to the Earth that at the edge of the world, people can only crawl or be tiny as bottles. You can not imagine yourself sitting on the edge of the world with your beloved and kick your heels over the edge. If you embrace the spherical Earth theory, then you must give up the notion of the edge of the world and the dome of sky. But it doesn't happen in Estonian language studies. They seem to say they understand that the paradigm has changed, but in fact, they do not. I was a member of a workgroup raising the new generation of Estonian linguistics. It was the group of Generative Grammar in Tartu University in 60's and 70's. Mati had already graduated by then, a post graduate researcher, and he was one of the great and wise I met there. He was a very independent thinker and engaged in a field nobody knew much, so we listened very carefully. He was already kind of stubborn and prone to big speeches, sometimes exaggerating, too, so we used to say, Don't believe what Hint says, Hint has crazy ideas. That's how it was indeed. In the end of the 70's and the beginning of the 80's. It really was. Some one came up with the idea that in Estonian language, all the vowels and consonants have four phonological durations. And vowels have tones, too. Like in Chinese. And it was a completely crazy time. Estonian Papers in Phonetics. The whole yearbook dedicated to this kind of theories. "Uncompromising" is the word that applies to Mati Hint. Because if he was convinced in something, then he was convinced dead seriously. And one of these things was our system of durations, so when in the 70's, there an attempt to introduce 4th duration, and it was even discussed whether, if something grows to become a tree (kasvab puuks), is any different from simple flatulence (puuks). It goes like this. Let's say that we have long cores of syllables. "Kooli" and "kooli". Just like the two different o-s are phonemes. Similarly, two different diphthong durations are also phonemes. It is, in fact, very simple. Jakob Hurt has it in a completely contemporary form and examples. What Mati Hint has promoted for decades, is a syllable duration. Meaning that when we are talking about long or extra long syllables, then the syllable carries the duration, so we can also talk about light or strong stress, but the stress is carried by syllable. Yet it was clear for Elmar Muuk as early as in 1938, how it should be done. But spitefully, we don't do as Elmar Muuk did. We know better than Elmar Muuk. But we are not! At all! It adds up to nothing. In the end, it's like... The Language Act of the year, the big Dictionary of Standard Estonian, marks the durations of syllables using its own system. And in the end, recommends to use it all as per Tiiu Erelt's standardization that has nothing to do with this matter. Absolutely nothing! It's beside the point. As if... As if, growing potatoes, you would study. Moon rays' impact to the growth of telephone poles. They have no connection! Mati's theory was certainly new at the time and developed phonology and it helped a lot, but it was not a theory that would overturn all others, rather a part of the process. I'd like it if in humanities, it would be as in building bridges. The engineer who has designed a bridge has to stand under the bridge during the first stress test. He knows that he has to do it. He doesn't steal materials from the bridge so that it would crumble upon him. I'd like it if it would be the same way in humanities. You have to pass certain checks against some criteria. Is it possible? It's all there. But it's so much more convenient to sit in a comfort zone and apply for grants with your friends. In 1976, Mati Hint published a programmatic article, "Language as a Giant System". There he summarizes his achievements in his research process of a very young person. He describes language as a giant and complicated system. How it is a great achievement of mankind to create such a system. He has developed the idea of a giant system in his later works, too. Thanks to Uno Rätsep, Ülo Kaasik and Ivar Kull, an idea appeared, as it was fashionable in the Western world, to merge mathematics and linguistics. I went with this wave. As I quickly learnt German, I read a book that profoundly changed my world view, Saussure in German translation that should have been destroyed. For according to Soviet ideology, linguistic structuralism was a bourgeois pseudo science. But the German translation of Saussure turned out to be in the famous Seminarka library. I made a perfectly good summary of it. I could use it today. And this changed my world view profoundly. So he showed how language is in constant change and it also means that language is naturally redundant and standardised written language also has variants. That was not acceptable for many as they found that if you learn the rules of the written language, and know all the exceptions by heart, than that's it. Some even thought that not everyone is capable of knowing and speak correct Estonian language, because Estonians can't speak Estonian anyway. Most of my papers are about Estonian sounds system, prosody and morphophonology. When talking to Finnish professors, we understand each other instantly. But not in Estonia. Just as if I were a deviant. If that's my truth, if that is how I understand things, I can't lie just to please some people. The grammar of Estonian language by Ahrens, is the foundation of our becoming a cultural nation, of our becoming Estonians and a literate nation. Rauna homestead Saaremaa. As they say, he was rigorous but fair. And he didn't have an easy character. After all, he was very... He was abrupt. As his students said, he didn't hold anything for himself, always said what he thought and saw right. It was the same at home. But he was indeed fair. When he was wrong, he made it right. Estonian language is our only life insurance. I think Mati Hint has been compared to a canary in a mine. Things may not be very wrong, but when Mati Hint wrote or spoke about something, then he could represent it with a certain amount of drama that meant that it's not fun and games but has to be addressed very seriously. He became a very important, significant person during the Perestroika. Because he was a philologist known to the general public, he was outspoken, straightforward, sharp. When Vikerkaar magazine appeared during the Perestroika, they published Mati Hint's article 'Bilingualism Without Pink Glasses' And I remember that we waited for the next issue to read a new part of it. It was read in all the Soviet republics and I think that for many people it became a spark or launching power of the national movement against Soviet language policy. It was a powerful article. Vikerkaar had appeared for six months and I met Mati Hint at the office of the magazine on Toompuiestee street. An issue bothered him, namely of bilingualism, rooting, of course, from the russification campaign of 1970's. One of the manifestations against it was the Letter of 40, with Mati Hint among the signatories. Then we really stood shoulder to shoulder and the phosphorite movement was about to begin, then IME, then the Popular Front. And for Mati Hint, the Popular Front became one of the manifestations of his political life. At the Song Festival Grounds in 11. September of 1988, Mati hint delivered one of the most powerful speeches. Alongside Heinz Valk. And the proudest moment for Mati Hint was in 1989, when he wrote his famous manifesto 'The Baltic Way' that he also delivered at the Town Hall Square. The history of the Baltic states is one of co-operation of East an West, but also one of the fight for power. For many years, this fight has forced the Baltic states under foreign powers that had always denied the right of the indigenous nations to shape their own history. But even under the foreign rule, the Baltic nations, Estonians, Latvians, Lithuanians, have maintained their national identity. The Baltic way is the European way, linguistically, culturally and nationally diverse Europe is the only way to maintain and develop the rich cultural heritage of Europe. My speech at the Baltic assembly, at the Town Hall Square... I made it to the cover of Time. Heinz, me... The correspondent of Time understood that the popular fronts have taken the course of full political independence. It was very important for him that the Baltic states could act in unison. Who did we have to rely on? We relied on our neighbours, Latvians and Lithuanians, on progressive minded Russians, naturally, on Denmark and Iceland, and some other small countries that backed us, but... And indeed, he went to the White House, to USA, and appeared on CNN or some other leading channel. In America, they asked me, how much independence do we really want. As if it were a matter of some percentages. I answered with the words of Endel Lippmaa: "As much as possible!" It was during the Baltic Chain and due to this, he could comment it straightforwardly and tell about it and explain. But not only. He has been something like our foreign minister in many places in the world. Like Jaan Poska of our time. In the 80's, during the Perestroika, Mati Hint was one of the first people who started to talk about Language Act. And requirements for Estonian language skills. About the need to speak the language, even if you had lived here for decades without. Mati Hint saw language as a developing entity and got the opportunity to contribute to the Language Act. He worked on it together with Enn Põldroos. And he was the one who saw through the attempt to bend the act to give Russian language a special position in Estonia. The history of making the Language Act is a very fine example how counter actions to regaining independence for Estonia started immediately and in every possible aspect. A secret commission was formed behind the back of Language Commission. There were two vice chairmen of the commission, Henn Saari and Vladimir Beekman Endel Veskimäe, the lawyer of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet and Maia Leosk, the secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. They took and co-ordinated the Moscow minded version of the Language Act with none the less than Vladimir Jarovoy, the director of Dvigatel and the leader and ideologists of the Internazis. There was the Internazi version of the Language Act that they deceptively wanted to set up for voting. I squeezed myself into that meeting. Literally squeezed myself in. I was given a chair so that I could sit there beside the wall. Saari just read this text aloud, and even Ristlaan mumbled. Even Ristlaan mumbled: "What in the world is this?" At one point I decided that I have to pull my courage together. I have to stand up and tell that it is not the text the commission has made. That it is something completely different. Then there was big argument and Saari said that while doing these amendments, he hadn't kept in mind the best interest of his home republic. What did he keep in mind? The general interest! Mostly to avoid criticism from Moscow. That was on 13. January. When the Language Act was voted on 18. January 1989, then there was the text prepared by the rightful Language Act commission. There were very few changes to our latest version. He was honest, with great conscience and in fact, very powerful. He was a powerful character who was able to deliver matters of language as well as of importance for Estonia to the general public very well. He wrote much, spoke much, was excellent speaker, very influential. He played very important role in passing the Language Act. If you ask what did I achieve in the parliament, what's the positive balance... Making Estonia and Tallinn a prostitution country, turning it to Nordic Bangkok, I made this idea to fail. I think I was one of the main players, I dealt with it as my personal matter. To some extent, it was personal, meaning that all sorts of companies targeted my female students. The ideology itself didn't change. It's still there. It has impact today, too. But at least it is not legal. But if you sum up three years of frantic work... For the three years in the parliament... A bit too little. We all could have kept on. I, too, left in 1995, with Mati. We didn't take another round and went back. It was easier for Mati, as he had been respected in linguistics all along. I saw that you can't do anything. That was the reason. You can't do anything. You are lucky if you get some allies when you want to push something back. When you want to pull something through, then it's even more difficult. Meaning of Estonian is like meaning of life, you can't live without searching. This is my so-called exit file. In fact, exitlessness file. There are tens of reports about me advocating leaving the Soviet Union, restoring the bourgeois republic. Representing nationalist views and whatnot. A special department has followed my personal intimate relationships. These are also all here. But I have nothing to be ashamed of, I did marry this girl. We have been married for over 60 years. But they have followed even that. Just as it's done today. And I find it completely unacceptable. He was let out briefly in the end of the 60's, to a phonetics conference in Prague. There he established his first contacts with western linguists. Later on, he was not let to go anywhere, but the contacts remained. Here's the list of my correspondents. KGB knew them. Although I myself didn't get out. But this is... 1972. They already had the list of my foreign correspondents. With whom I exchanged letters, books. There are outstanding linguists of the world. In 1988, Mati finally managed to go abroad, because he had not hidden his attitude towards Soviet Union and he was in the non-exit list. He arrived a little late, because his exit permit was delayed, and people applauded when Mati Hint finally got to go abroad. But his work was already internationally known. As an intellectual, he used softer methods for being a dissident, so that it would be possible to actually do something. He wasn't the type who would smash head on to the wall and be imprisoned afterwards to be unbreakable there. He would rather keep undermining quietly. After the deliberation, he is constantly criticising the government and its mistakes. He was not disappointed in Estonian Republic, but kept pointing out the problems. It was unthinkable for Mati Hint to join the communist party. He is a classic tragic hero. His family had undergone horrible injustice and restoring of justice was the mission of Mati Hint. It rose from the suffering of his family, close people, and, of course, the whole Estonian society. At first, I was afraid to read my file I was afraid to meet people there, people I know. What would I do with them then? But luckily, there was almost none. And those who I think I'm recognising by their writing, their reports to the agency do not really say anything. 'He is wearing clean clothes, is shaving...' 'Probably not beating his wife.' 'Behaving correctly, saying hello in the staircase.' Things like that. Ülpre homestead Rõngu. Mati's father was arrested in his home, in Ülpre, and based on false, made up accusations sentenced to deportation to Siberia after long trial. His wife, along with two underage children, was evicted from their home in late autumn with just the clothes they had. It was always combined with confiscation of all property. But the final verdict did not state it. So Ülpre homestead seemingly still belonged to Mati's father. Based on this, Mati's father argued in court. Against Soviet powers. In order to get back his homestead that has not been confiscated from him. Then the same repeated after the deliberation. Because the homestead had went from a sovkhoz to kolkhoz as a property without owner. So it was sold to bona fide purchaser. When it became possible to apply for returning the property, then Mati reclaimed hos father's home. And he did not get it back. But my father's file... That was horrible reading. How acquaintances, neighbours have lied about my father, testified things that did not happen. And I think it's very widespread in Estonian society. The split in the society is so deeply rooted. That's what sometimes causes the feeling of despair. Johannes and Emilie Retsnik. Emilie was my father's grandmother's sister. Johannes had a cottager's plot. He was not a rich man. He married Emilie, knowing that she will die shortly. Not because of that, but knowing that it will happen. And indeed, Emilie died in two week's time. She had lung tuberculosis. But nevertheless, Johannes took Emilie's sister's children, her sister's daughter, my grandmother, and her children, my father and aunt, to his place after they were evicted from their home. It was supposed to be for a moment, but it lasted 32 years. So for me, my grandparents' home is at Johannes' house, or Juku's, we always called him Juku. His home is my grandparents' home, I know no other place. I have spent nine summers of my childhood there, before they moved to Tartu. There were three rooms in that house. In the big beautiful house it is now. Three rooms, and it was the same way after the war when they came here. My father as a little child, his sister a couple of years older, and their mom. From their home, they took with them a farm hand who had nowhere to go, and a female servant, also without options to go somewhere. Eventually, Juku returned from Vasalemma prison, so there were five adults and two children living in that house. And one room was not heated during the winter. That's how they lived here. It was tense. Father always told how someone just reading a book was scorned a bit. Like 'Why don't you do something useful?' But mom bought him books from Tartu when she managed to save some money. And he read, in very poor light. That ruined his eyes, I suppose. Mati started to long for Tartu very much, and Ülpre, when he was already of age, when we had already bought the house in Saaremaa. We have spent our summers there for 40 years by now. And near the end of his life, he began to... He was just sorry until the end of his days for what he had missed here in his childhood home and his family's home. Southern Estonia may be mentally the strongest Estonian speaking area. Pauline Klavina, the musical leader of one Livonian ensemble, is writing that she's spending some time in the summer in Vaide, at her birthplace. That's one thing that is rare in this world. A correspondence in Livonian like this. When the international Association of Friends of Livonia was founded, then Mati Hint took part actively there and joined the associations' summer trips to Livonia. The first time was in 1959. Every student of Finno-Ugric languages had to specialise on a small language. First, I thought that the language can't be related to Estonian. I can understand nothing. It's maybe because Vääri speaks Latvian that I didn't at the time. But in fact, it's very closely related, once you get the ties. I started to understand it in two weeks and started to write in it, too. In 1960's, Livonian was spoken quite widely in Livonian villages. And up to 1990's, even. And on the first trips some 20 years ago that we did with Mati, we always found some last native speakers. I can say it in Estonian now that the language of the shore sounds beautiful. And when I'm thinking that in Canada, the last real native Livonian speaker who died about six years now, when he was interviewed and asked to speak Livonian, it was so pure that he had to speak it by himself, at least in his mind. Otherwise, it wouldn't have been preserved, he had no one. And I want to keep my Livonian, as long as I live, in shape, so sometimes during car rides, I tell to my wife what I see. It's mostly about the road being winding as if drawn by a foxes' tail. End of story. I remember particularly well his last trip, it was in 2017. Then he said that he is visiting the Livonians for 20th time and this will be the last trip. But in the bus and everywhere, he told very much about his memories related to Livonians. He had photo albums with him that he showed, and I think that one very important role of his is documenting Livonian language and culture in 1960's and 70's. They took me into their hearts, too. Some elderly people took me into their heart so much that they wanted me to inherit their house or homestead. I said that I don't need any trouble with your family and relatives. For that to rise. Some gave me shirts, and so on, that were very dear to me until they wore out. Getting attention was very important for them. But when the end was close, I remember a situation when we were at the Mazirbe school courtyard with another tour bus, then some Latvian boys said: 'So you came to see your dead relatives!' Children! He saw demise of a nation in front of his eyes. It naturally had its impact on him. For me, Livonian language was mostly just love. Southern Estonia is different. As I'm Southern Estonian, it's very important for me what's going on in South Estonia. I'm deeply disturbed by this. The fact that Southern Estonian language is considered a dialect today, is an insult for me. Mati was especially concerned about Tartu language. And the fate of written Tartu language. Through centuries, we had two written languages, of Tallinn and Tartu. Southern Estonian children, around the birthplace of Mati Hint, have learnt to read and write in Tartu language. As the Soviet rule was crackling, and an independence started to loom, everyone awoke, including Southern Estonians. And their sole objective was that their language would not disappear. Mati Hint was one to strengthen their faith in that not happening. And his word was very valuable support to his colleagues as well as, even more, to Southern Estonians. My sense for danger for Estonian language is surely greater because I've seen how it can end. There's no point in coming to the sincerity to yawn. When he taught us, it was deep Soviet time. And from the very beginning, he showed us clearly, straightforwardly, his utter despise towards the Soviet regime, the Party and everything that surrounded us. For us, Hint was something like Panso for theatre students. In dialect practise trips, he promoted his ideas. His pro-Estonian ideas. The trips were often to Southern Estonia to his childhood parts and he used to tell how it was there before the war and what came later during the deportations and after the war. I also remember a moment after our practise trip and finalised our dialect slips and some girls who had studied longer than us forgot phonetic transcription. Evidently they had turned in very faulty slips. Hint started to analyse the slips. And one of the girls did something that caused a piece of chalk shattering against a table. I recall that it was a sunny winter day, sun shone in through auditorium window and chalk dust floated in a dead silent auditorium, dissolving slowly. Then we experienced the thunder, the Hint thunder. It was memorable and in a way, very powerful. Very warm, very understanding. Sometimes very unpredictable. His moods could vary quite often and quickly. Extremely considerate towards other people. It was in fact quite clear that without good command of Estonian you will not graduate from this university. And that was why students were afraid of Hint. At the same time, in an examination, when he saw that you had studied, understood things, then he was extremely supportive. In that sense, he always respected a student. There are famous stories about his entrances and tests of general knowledge where meaningful answers were seldom. How many Estonians are there? How many Russians? Estonian speakers? This sort of things. The point of these questions was to show that we do not grasp the proportions and do not, for instance, the ratio of Estonian speakers to Russian speakers. His first class was The Basics of Linguistics and this is when I understood how interesting subject linguistics is. Up to that point, I had thought that it was nothing but commas, subjects, objects, predicates and quotation marks. That was an eye opening experience and I became his fan almost immediately. It was an interesting class in the sense that in the course of that, a textbook for high school formed and was published in 1983. It caused a serious storm in Estonian school circles because it was the first textbook that tried to approach language semiotically. It was also the first textbook containing wrong forms and explaining why they were wrong. The classes he taught and his approach to linguistics was superb. I suppose he left Tartu for personal reasons, because he did his PhD thesis in the Institute of Language and Literature. He worked there. But he didn't like the atmosphere there, Endel Sõgel in particular, and he found more liberal atmosphere in Pedagogical Institute. And he stayed there. It's probably thanks to him, too, that it has become a serious university. So it's not coincidence or miracle that Tallinn University chose Mati Hint its first honorary member. But when I started to work there, Mati invited me to apply and I took his place there in 2000. I have revisited my examination transcripts afterwards and noticed that see, that student has become a journalist, that one is a notable player in culture or a writer and so on, so there are many people who have given or giving much to Estonian culture. The generation now in their forties that carries on everything that Mati spoke for back then. When man stays himself, he gets much. There was an accident worse than one can imagine. When you have to bury your child. And it so happened that our son, on 21. November 2001, having built with his own hands and help from his wife Astrid an apartment on the top floor of a house in Kadriorg, in the attic as we called it, where another young man had built an apartment too, was clearing roof tiles. Actually, the neighbour did, as they were on his side and they were lying there. Madis took the tiles from him under the hatch there. It was cold as always. Madis was wearing only his shirt, anxiously waiting for next handful. And he went out to the roof, too. But it's a very steep roof. They had been to the roof before and no one knows why he fell. Although it's not difficult to slip there. So that sad anniversary is approaching, 20 years. So journalists of his age probably remember him as a journalist. He would have been 51 in autumn, recently, on 27. October. When our son Madis was killed, after being a war correspondent in hot spots all over the world, without anything happening to him, except for... We have a photo, where a wall is full of bullet holes around him. He stood at the wall and bullet holes were around him. In Chechnya, where he was a war correspondent, too, there was order in effect. Wherever he slept, a gunman slept at the door of his room. Nothing happened there, but as soon as he came home, he was killed. As Astrid couldn't think of any other place where he could be buried but in Saaremaa, our tie to Saaremaa is now inevitable. Although we are going to Rõngu cemetery. Pick up the candles. Place one here, one for grandpa. And one for the second child. If we can light them, then there's one for every child. Among philologists, he was one of the best known, if not the best known. A philologist who the society knew, people from other fields. He knew how to promote language to make it more understandable. But also to fight for righteousness and justice, that's important for me. Mati's contribution to Estonian language is indisputable and vast as a researcher as well as a political figure. And young Estonian Republic truly needed the work he did to secure the status of Estonian language. I'd like to discuss things with him, and think of current developments and hear his statement "Leave every hope you have". He has very good, very unconventional sense of humour. So to mutter in the dark of the night, that would be cool, that's what I'd like. His call was to teach the teachers, as he has said. And there is no one in Estonian culture to compare to him. He was truly a phenomenon. Not only my friend, but a friend of all of us. It was very important for him that Estonian people would do well. Like many great men of the past, Mati Hint is a symbol of not only a linguist, but a serious Estonian man who keeps on having an effect. Students of Mati Hint. - We are his first class. Graduated in 1980, right? - Yeah. One of the classes he supervised, the favourite class. One of these, there was another one ten years later. They are accidentally here. - Completely. Very accidentally! - It wasn't agreed at all. We set out to come and see where Mati is resting. And see who we met. - It's the anniversary of his burial. We buried the urn exactly one year ago. Me and Karin can recall that after the first year, we were the ones who had to go and wish Mati a happy birthday. Because on 28. August, we were in Tallinn. We went to Trummi street to greet him. Mati got very old, 40. At the Trummi store, our hearts started to race and it lasted until we reached his house. Later, with our graduation paper, it was the same. Every time we went there, our hearts started to race at the Trummi store. You were afraid? - Out of respect. Afraid, too, because Mati always said what he thought. I don't meet my classmates like that. I don't have this kind of relationship with my students. They haven't had this kind of student life. Mati was effectively our class teacher, he knew everything. Told off when needed, protected if necessary.
