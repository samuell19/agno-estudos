SAL: Stan, I'm getting real tired of you dodging my phone calls. You know what today is? Today is the last day of the second extension that I've given you. I wake up to no phone calls, no emails, not even a text. Well now, look, Sal. I was just finishing up, and I was gonna send that out tonight. SAL: Yeah, I'm sure. You're probably sitting there in your housecoat, in your slippers, and that busted ass old typewriter. If you had a laptop like everyone else, you'd be done by now. Why the hell do you insist on using that ancient piece of shit anyways? STAN: It's, well, it's where all my ideas come from. SAL: Listen, man, I'm too busy for your bullshit.
