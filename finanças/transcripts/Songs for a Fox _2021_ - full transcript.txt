(SONGS FOR A FOX) Dainius, our condolences. We can't make it to bid farewell to Justina. A & B There's a very good description in that Barnes novel what it's like, you know, to lose someone. And how friends react to it. As if it's contagious. Well, let's just act normal. - My hands are dirty. - Dude, I'm so sorry. Thanks, Aidas. - So sorry. - Thank you. - Stay strong. - Thanks, Brigita. How was America? Good, good. You know, it was great. Except we missed that flight. But it wasn't our fault so they'll give us a refund. Holy cow! What's that? Echo. Cool. Damn! We've got one like this. What did Justina used to call them? “Dream Works” or something? Dream Findings. I read her post. She said she had some kind of device that helps her do pottery in her dreams somehow. Damn! It's cool, though. Isn't it? An artist, living in a dome and doing pottery in her sleep. Pretty cool marketing story. Wasn't your agency involved with that? This is the dreamband. This thingy? How does it work? It, uhm... It scans your brainwaves. You put it on before sleep and it starts flashing like ambulance or something. It's impossible to fall asleep next to Justina. Wouldn't she wake up? She would, but in a dream. You mean... This can make you aware when you're in a dream? Sure. You just connect it to your phone somehow. Maybe there's an app for it. It's the last day of our holidays. I really don't want to leave. Dainius is in town and I'm by the sea. I'm receiving the signal from the dreamband, and I know that I'm dreaming I open the door of the fisherman's hut and voila, I'm in my workshop. I see a strange hollow rock outside that looks like a bent sleeve of a coat. Through the sleeve, smoke is rising to the sky, like from a huge incense burner. And she walks and walks... Then this Kamile came. Very cool girl - one of us. And then we partied all night. We went to another bar at 4 AM. She jumps on the table and goes, "Hey, we should do a theatre piece together! You'll do the music, Brigita - scenography and I'll direct.“ She's a big fan of your music. I couldn't believe her. I'm like, “Are you serious? We're self-taught. We only play our own songs." She's like, “Yeah, that's exactly what I need." Obviously, you're not quite up to it now, but maybe the music will help you forget. Won't it? Forget what exactly? I mean, just move on. Keep on living. Move forward. - Damn it, you know what I mean. - No. Look, I... We... understand how you feel. That's a great opportunity. Kamile is a rising theatre star. Damn, my hunch tells me this could be awesome. I'm staying here. So you gonna quit the agency? You used to make it more bitter. It's more of a lager now, isn't it? Dude, we got a chance to play again. OK. OK what? One condition, though. Sure, we'll do anything. Anything? Can you call Justina... out of the cave for supper? Out of the cave? That's where... she's buried. Your author didn't work. What author? Bar... - Barnes? - Barnes. Were you still asleep? I just woke up. Was having a nightmare. Really? Congratulations! Don't worry, not all dreams are nightmares. Wow! Look at all these mushrooms! I've got a full basket already. Come help me out. I dreamt that you died. The person you are calling is unavailable... Kerb! Good boy! Kerb! Damn, he's passed out again. When the fuck did he manage? Idiot sleeping in his own vomit. Look, he emptied it all. Stick that bottle up his ass. We'll put it on YouTube. That prick will learn not to drink on the job. What are you doing here? Picking mushrooms. What about you? I'll tell you. He's picked Red Cap shrooms! Get the fuck out of here! Aidas! What are you doing here? Dainius can't get through to you on the phone. I guess I left it in the car. Dainius found a child in the woods. By the end of summer, he disappeared and never came back. What did you say his name was? Gailis. Does it mean 'pity'? That's right, yours means 'sing'. Mine means 'echo.' Why do you think I put so much delay on our tracks? Gailis means a swamp plant. Its smell makes mushroom pickers dizzy. You can get pretty high on it. You mean, it's narcotic? Psychoactive. Gailis! Did you call the police? What was I supposed to tell them? That we found him in his vomit next to an illegal still in the woods? That won't help. Then let's call child services. What if his parents beat him or something? Children don't run into the woods just like that. It's a normal family. Justina knew them. Sure, all families in Lithuania are normal! And then kids come to school battered and everyone's OK with that. Are you done? You haven't even seen this kid! Why don't you go smoke another joint and calm down a bit? Teach me to stalk The prey Teach me to keep dry My tail I'm sitting all day By the cave I'm sitting all day I'm sitting the night through! Crawl forth! Crawl forth from the cave Crawl forth! Crawl forth from the cave Exercise before sleep: Close your eyes and knead imaginary clay for a few minutes. Imagine that you are dreaming. Tactile senses get stronger in dreams. Kerb! Hey, boy! Where are you going? Where's Justina? What are you doing here? He went inside. To the ground. Yeah. He's hiding from the sun. Kerb, come here. I'm piling sawdust over there from the toilet. Kerb, come here. Have some cheese. Dad didn't hit you? No. He killed himself. When? Last summer. This looks like shit. Don't judge by appearance. Don't judge that I'm an idiot. Maybe you are an idiot, and just dreaming that you're not? You're the one dreaming! - You know what I am doing there? - Go ahead. I'm building a gate to dreams. Dream portal. Farewell, my dream. Wanna give me a hand? Where's Justina? She is away. Why can't you just tell me where she is? She's abroad. You know, with her shows. OK, Master, I'll come next time. Don't call me that. Seriously, I'll pay you if you help me. A Dream Portal is a metaphor. I'm trying to learn to control my dreams. And I need a dream assistant. A what? Helper. Like I said, farewell my dream. Look... This is Justina's book. If you can control your dreams, you can do anything in them. I don't remember last time I dreamt. You don't remember but you can learn to control them. People walking through walls? Easily. Justina didn't talk about it? She is the expert, I'm just learning. Why don't you ask her? She is your friend. Now she is away so you could take her place. When is she coming back? In a month maybe. I don't have that much time. I have other jobs to do. I know about your 'jobs'. Look, what's your biggest dream right now? A Playstation. That's what you want the most? Yes and a virtual headset. So you can have your Playstation and virtual reality headset in a dream. Whatever you want. I don't need it in a dream, I need it here. And where are you gonna get it from? Somebody promised me one. - Who? - Fiend. Your main work starts at night. Will I be paid more for that? Sure. You do realise the rates double up at night? Double? Alright. Look, so... I'm setting the alarm for 5AM. When you wake up, you enter the dome. You'll watch me sleep and when you see that I'm dreaming... How do I know you're dreaming? My eyes will be moving like this. Like a junkie. Well, yeah. Then you ask me quietly, "Do you know where you are?" I will have to answer you. You'll be sleeping. That's right. And in my sleep, I'll slowly move my eyes sideways. What if you don't? Then ask louder. Just don't say my name. Why not? Because I'm gonna wake up. Can I call you Master? Call me anything you like, just don't say my name. Or I'll wake up and you will loose your bonus. So if you find that gate, where will it take you? To a fox's cave. Won't it bite you? No, it doesn't live there anymore. - So what do you wanna find there? - Something I lost. Can you film what you do there with your phone? I can, but how am I supposed to show it to you? It's like in your video games. You can have weapons there, but you can't take them out. Same with dreams. You have things there, but you can't take them out. Can I really play in a dream like on a computer? Think about your brain. It's like a Turbo Playstation. "Think about your brain." My brain thinks on its own. And what do you do meanwhile? I poop. Wait! Let's go zombie shooting instead. Forget about your gate. If you're hungry, feel free to raid the fridge. And don't oversleep or no bonus for you! Wait, what do I say? "Who are you? What are you doing?" Good night! I'm gonna feed Kerb. Do you know where you are? I am telling you. You are the master of the dream. You are coming to a foxhole. You are now in front of the foxhole. MASTER OF THE DREAM From right to left From left to right Shotgun barrels are drawing circles in the air Waving her tail she's parading Pupils follow her way Rotten boards are breaking Feet are going down in mud Sink! I love her I love her more Than myself She's used to being stalked Yet bullets are whistling, Pellets piercing She lies face down. Is it a mortal wound? Gailis? Good morning. Did you go through the gate? Uh huh. So, that's it? - What do you mean? - You can start teaching me. You didn't expect to make it? I didn't expect you to be such a good assistant. "6:31AM, he replied to me moved his eyes from left to right." I replied? Is that me? Burglary near Seseleliai village. Go. 'Go.' Kazys took the car in for service. Does that mean burglars get a day off? Take your own. Not again! I'm out of gas. Take mine then. The keys are on the table. OK. Hello, I'm investigator Valentina Bankeviciute, and you? Dainius Balsys. Where do you live? I'm from Vilnius. I'm from Vilnius too. What do you do around here? Having a vacation in my parents' summer house. Tell me everything from the beginning. So I discovered a moonshine still in the forest. - Out in the swamp. - When was it? I don't remember. Three or four days ago. Why didn't you report it until today? I thought you knew about it. Sir, how would we know about it? - There was a drone. - What drone? Well it was filming. I thought it was yours. Ours. It's a Europe-funded program, coordinated from the capital. There's a drone raid going on in the district now. Were you able to identify those two men? Mr. Dainius, we can't disclose any information at this point. Investigation is under way and all the information is being processed. But your testimony will help us a lot. Would you please write down your phone number? It's good that you came to report it. All the locals know those stills, but keep their mouths shut. Thank you again. We'll call you if we need anything. One more thing... - There was a kid. - What kid? A boy, something like 12 years old. He was drunk, sleeping in his puke. They're using him. Good that you remembered. Although we have no reports on missing children. Some parents don't even care that their children are missing. We will take care of it. Passed-away artist drew inspiration from her dreams Liar. Networks of neurons stretches like a zodiacs On the dark dome of the sky In a sleeve turned inside out – There is an alternate reality Damn! I don't know how they can stand the same song over and over again. The boundaries are turning In a sleeve turned inside out – There is an alternate reality The boundaries are turning... I really loved your song about the fox. It's actually our song. Right. Loved it. It'd be great for my play. - And what's the play about? - Eurydice. And Orpheus. Have you read it? Back in school maybe. So Orpheus loved his wife Eurydice. They were married, things were awesome. But then Eurydice got stung by a snake and died. Orpheus wasn't cool with it so he went to Hades to get his wife back. Hades said OK. But you can't look at her on your way back. If you do, your wife stays here forever. And he looks back. I remember. Why does he look back? Because his wife calls him. Wouldn't you turn back? Why does she call him? She doesn't want to follow him. I lost you In an imaginary moment To find you In an imaginary world One more time... One more time Stones... aeons... To find you In an imaginary moment One more time Someone's here. Grandma? Tell me, kid, how does my cabin look now? Where do I begin? The doors have been heightened, since I kept bumping my head. Your father would often hit his head. I don't remember you doing it. You cannot possibly remember. What about the bread oven? It's been restored. Crawl under it. You'll find a small box there. Put the cross on your neck. Do you truly miss her so much? Close the door. Kerb! Gailis! Where's my child? - Pardon? - I said, where's my boy? You're Gailis' mother? That's it, I'm calling the police. - Why police? - What's going on? This man kidnapped my son! He worked for us last summer. You were OK with that. Justina, God rest her soul, came to ask my permission! And now you just took him! He was with me three days ago. He went home to tell you and disappeared. I came to look for him. What's going on, mom? Look at this boss. He lost Gailis. Did you make him assist rituals at the bubble? Oh, he's from the sect in the bubble! I didn't know Gailis had a brother. Half brother. Did you know that Fiend uses Gailis to fire up the pot in the swamp? What kind of madness are you talking about? He's dreaming. Call the police. Go look for your brother! Get out of here! Kiss the eyes, whisper to the ears, Kiss the lips... I know a guy who spins a mill with his dick... You put a rope through, tie a knot, attach another bottle. It's convenient. You can carry a lot this way. Not a lot! Just three or four bottles. Let's have one. Bottom up! My fiancee, Valia. - We met. - I know. I didn't order anything like that. Try it! - It's not fatty. - It's our neighbour's wife's hand. She was a good woman, but you can't say she wasn't fat. Just a finger. Dear folks! Dear folks! Can you hear me? - Dear folks! - Dear folks! Listen to her! Shut up! As far as I can tell, nobody is complaining about the bride's chair being empty. Not even the groom. As though it's supposed to be that way, isn't it? Still, I'd like to ask all of you, who gathered here to wish happiness to the newlyweds. Is this really how it should be, dear folks? No! Would you like the bride to return to the groom? Yes! Just don't hang me, please! MATCHMAKER LIAR Why hang you? Today we are modern Europeans. Do we really need to follow those age-old traditions? No! Let's make a gentlemen's agreement. You give me the kid, and I'll give you the bride. You said before you needed the pistol. Take it. 'Take it!' Did you hear that? Come here, kiddo, I'll take care of you. Help me, what are you waiting for? How many nights How many nights are you wandering? I so... so searched for you I'm so... so waiting for you Don't look back! Don't look back! I can't count How many nights I'm wandering around Can't stop Can't stop my tongue from seeking bare wire I don't exist I so... so searched for you I'm so... so waiting for you Turn me on, plug me in Don't look back! Don't look back! It tinkles. - Wanna hear our new song? - Sure, if it's good. Take a puff and it will be good. Gosh, can you remove those sticks? The smell of resin is making me sick. She's pregnant. From the dreams What can I Bring back From the dreams? A rhythm of bentgrass I can bring A thread of notes I can bring A heart's pace I can bring A blink of an eye What can I Bring back From the dreams? From the dreams Just air between wings Gap between strings I can bring back No, no I can't bring you back No, no, Love I can't bring you back What's this? Are you dreaming? Don't you know that a bride gives a wreath of rue to a groom? Fiend got arrested. Are you dreaming? Is my dream assistant dead? Nice hoodie. Cool, huh? It's the Super Mario mushroom. I want to start my dreaming studies with this game. Get up, it's late. Did I hit the break? Don't start. We're in different weight categories. Get up. Get up! OK, OK. What happened here? Who burnt it? Fiend. This is for you. Breakfast of liars. This is for you. Music of liars. FOR GAILIS But you can listen to it only in a dream. SONGS FOR A FOX
