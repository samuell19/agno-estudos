[Quartermain] King Solomon's mines... Like many others, well... I didn't believe in them. In those days, Africa was a land of many romantic legends. It had a vast, unexplored interior. I was a hunter and it wasn't until the year 1881 that I learnt that the mines were a stark reality. I say "were" because they now lie buried under a million tons of ashes and lava. At the time I'm speaking of, diamonds had been found in Kimberley. Many adventurous spirits from all parts of the world... You've struck lucky again, red. Yes. You can count your money tomorrow. I'll have 5 pounds on account to get drunk with. [Laughing] Get your backs to the wall, the whole boiling lot of you. Don't shoot, boys. It isn't a hold-up. I'm just tending myself and the treasures of Arabia. Cast an eye over that, me boy, and see what you make of it. What have you found? A house, carriage and pair for me daughter and the life of Riley hereafter and evermore. Did you ever see the like? A nice piece of crystal, O’Brien, but no diamond. You don't mean it? I'm sorry, miss Kate. That's bad luck, Patrick, bad luck. Bad luck nothing. I was only having a joke with you. Come on, girl. [Donkey braying] Try again, patsy. Devil I will. I spurn the diamond fields under me shoes. If we could only get to the coast, I could get a job teaching. And would you like it? I would not. [O'Brien] Of course you wouldn't. Listen, there was a man in the bar last night from the Congo. He says there's a fortune in ivory. There's been a fortune in everything we've tried, but it wasn't us who found it. From now on, we'll be decent, respectable citizens, and we're going to the coast before I change me mind. How much money have we? Less than a pound and all our traps are in the pawnshop. What's that you have? For you, a gift I bought to celebrate our magnificent discovery. A shamrock! For luck. It didn't cost a thing. I know what it cost. There were two in mulligan's store. Here's the other for you. Kathy, me girl, there was never anything to beat it. With a bit of shamrock apiece, there's nothing on earth can hold us down. Look! Glory be to god, straight from heaven. Ask him for a lift to the coast. It's a 5-week journey. It's a lot to ask. And you call yourself an Irishman? It's a fine morning. [O'Brien] It's a fine morning. Is it? It is. Are you going to the coast? No, Kitsfontein. Well, that's all on the way. Whose way? Ours. We were wondering if you'd give us a lift. No. Me name is Kathleen O'Brien, and this is me father, Patrick O'Brien, bachelor of arts, Trinity college, Dublin. Thank you. Bachelor of arts at Trinity college, Dublin! A down-and-out from the diggings, huh? We're down but we're not out. [Quartermain] You're out as far as my wagon's concerned. Oh! So you don't approve of us? I don't approve of tearing up the face of the country for greed. Me daughter is a good cook. I have a good cook. Me father's a wonder to talk. Yeah, he would be. [Kathy] And he's a lovely rifle shot. Just think of the game he could get for you. [Laughter] What's funny in that? Quartermain, best hunter in Africa. That ends it. It does not. Mr. Quartermain, you needn't take us if you don't want to, but here's something for you to think about in your precious solitude: Me father's own sister is dying in Kilkenny and if they never meet this side of the gates, 'tis you that will have prevented them. Jump up. ♪ [Spiritual singing] How much longer? Another 10 days. Look! [Kathy] Ah, the pretty creature. You startled her. Maybe she knows that in 10 days you'll be after her with your murdering guns. I'll get you a knife. You don't like hunting? No, I do not. Neither do I. Then what do you hunt for? A living. It pays me to run hunting trips. I've got 2 clowns waiting for me now. There must be a lot of money in hunting. I've been thinking over what that fella said about ivory. Have you had any experience in tracking game? He once took part in a badger hunt, but the badger escaped. You don't know what you can do till you try. While you're trying, your poor sister's peacefully passing away in Kilkenny. Alan Quartermain, it was a lie about me father's sister. I know, I've met the Irish before. I'm glad you owned up. And why shouldn't she? She's gonna settle down and teach school. You're going to settle down? Of course I am. I suppose there isn't anything in the ivory trade is there? If you ask me, there isn't a pin to choose between you. There's a wagon across the river. No. Antelope probably. I'm sure it's a wagon. Can't be. And why not? There's nothing across that river but devils. That's what the natives say. It's unexplored land, desert probably. It may be the devil's, but I can see a wagon. Come on! [Shouting] Take this. Water, quick! Whose wagon is this? He's not able to talk. It's the desert. Inside. [Man whispering] [Shouting in foreign language] That's all right, they're looking after him. The others ran away in the night many days ago. The fear was on them. Sure, the devil. He fell ill. We could not reach the north. Help him back to camp. I turned back. He does not know. Let me go on. Out of the way. You can't go on. You are ill. Do I care if I am ill? I don't know where you're going but... You want to know where I'm going but I tell you, you cannot follow. I crossed the desert. After the desert, I find king Solomon's mountain. After the mountain, I find king Solomon's mines. Diamonds. Sylvestra, when you see me again, I'll be the richest man on earth. So, out of the way! [Mumbling incoherently] [Gasping] Did you hear that? The mines of king Solomon over the desert. Is it true? True, we have heard of the mines. [Quartermain] Get me some water. [Speaking Kukuana] All the jewels of Ophrah and no one ever discovered where Ophrah was. That's where it is maybe. [Quartermain] Kathy! My medicine chest. All right. [Speaking Kukuana] What's that you have? A map. Look, 300 years old. He said a man went there and never came back. Look, the way across the desert and here, king Solomon's mountain and the mine. The jewels of Ophrah, the greatest treasure in the world! Now, that map is his. You had no right to take it. I know, but if he lives we won't use it, and if he doesn't, I'll seek the treasure myself and I'll have masses said for his soul. The shamrock! I said it'd bring us luck. [Quartermain] Kathy! I'm coming. Dig a grave. [Speaking Kukuana] ♪ [Chanting] All over? God rest his soul. Kathy asleep? It must be terrible to die alone in the desert without your folks. Terrible. What did you think of the map? How did you guess? I know human nature where treasure's concerned. Where's the harm? I returned it. After taking a copy. Will you be sending the map to his folks? And provoke somebody else to lose his life? Besides, he has no folks. Have you looked over it? Do you think it's genuine? It's unexplored country. Nobody knows. You're looking at a man who means to know. You're not gonna take that girl... What do you take me for? I'm her father, not a murderer. I shall go alone. In all me life, I may never get another chance like this. Of dying? Of finding an excuse for having been born. You'll think me a casual kind of a Mick, who doesn't care a crust if I've a shilling in me pocket to buy a meal for me own flesh and blood, but it's the way we Irish are, to take our troubles with a smile in our teeth while underneath, there is deep shame in me heart. Do you think I don't know what I owe to that child asleep there? I do know and here is where I mean to pay that debt in full. With your life, huh? If god wills it, with me life. How do you propose to make the journey? Hasn't Providence sent me a team of oxen? And a wagon, and strength and purpose to carry me to the ends of the earth? You know, O'Brien, there's only one kind of man that is useless to argue with. And that is? A fool. Eh. [Men speaking Kukuana] Inkoosi, our wagon, where is it? I'll take you on. At least you'll be sure of food and a wage. Kathy, wake up! I do not work for money and you do not go my way. [Quartermain] Kathy! All right. Allan Quartermain, he's gone after the treasure. I know. Without me. Me, who lay dreaming of the way we'd go together. Did you ever hear of such a thing? [Quartermain] Hurry up, they're starting. You're heading the wrong way. Aren't we going after me father? No. But... Put on your boots and get into the wagon. I told your father I'd look after you. You knew he was going and you let him go by himself. Allan Quartermain, will you take me after me father, please? We'll look for the mines together. And when we find them, you'll have your share and more, much more. Doesn't a fortune mean anything to you? All right, if you won't take me in your wagon I'll go on me own 2 feet. Did you hear what I said? I did. Then why don't you say something? [Quartermain] Because you're not going to do it. The Inkoosikas goes across the river. Yes, I do. What business is it of yours? The Inkoosikas has the map. I guide her. The map's in my wagon. No one's going across the river. Kathy, get into that wagon. Get into that wagon! What's your name? I have many names. One will do. Umbopa. Where do you come from? You're after diamonds. White men care for diamonds. Then why do you want to go north? Move up. [Speaking Kukuana] Now, look here, Umbopa. If you won't take service with me, I don't want you hanging about my camps. [Speaking Kukuana] That fella's up to no good. Allan Quartermain, I'll never speak to you again. Never! I'm used to silence. [Shouting] [Man speaking Kukuana] [Quartermain speaking Kukuana] My clients arrived last night. It'll be quite nice to have somebody to talk to. Put the Englishman’s gear in here. We'll use this wagon. How are you, Quartermain? How are you, sir? I'm afraid I kept you waiting. This is Miss O'Brien. [Henry] How do you do? Did you have a good trek? No, I did not. Don't mind Miss O'Brien, Sir Henry. She's strong and silent. The map is in the wagon. How did you get here? Inkoosikas does not forget her purpose? Good will insists on having his bath. No reason for being unsanitary, even in Africa. Quite right. Well, I'll see you both at dinner. Yes. How do you get out of this thing? You better ask Sir Henry to tip you out. Right. No, no... [mumbling] Sir Henry. Sir Henry Curtis. Sir Henry Curtis. Will you help me, please? I'm in terrible trouble. Mr. Quartermain wants me to send the wagon north so that the boys can have camp ready when you arrive but they won't obey me. Mutiny, eh? Glory be to god, I thought it was a pig. Commander Good, royal Navy. Retired. I'll go fetch Quartermain. Ah, no. Please don't. I don't want him to know I've had trouble. Will you speak to them? Of course I'll speak to them. By the way, I thought you were strong and silent. You wouldn't believe Mr. Quartermain. He's a terrible liar. Gentlemen, the queen. God bless her. With your permission, I'll light up. And with yours I'll run over a few of my proposals. I take it you want to get a sable antelope, sir Henry. Is miss O’Brien often as late as this? She'll show up when she's hungry. She seemed to me to be a capable young person. Hmm... yes, capable of anything. She'd have stolen one of my wagons if I hadn't kept me eyes open. [Quartermain] Anything wrong? I take it it's in order for sir Henry to tell your wagon boys to obey the young lady. With the result that your wagon is now proceeding north to establish a camp. But she told me... My boy, I'm afraid you're the victim of a woman's wiles. We must go after her. We certainly must. My only toothbrush is in that wagon. She has 3 hours start. It'll be 2 days before I gather a team. She told me those boys were mutinous. I'm afraid, sir Henry, that it's miss O’Brien who is mutinous.

Ashamed of yourself? But I'd do it again. Ready to come back? I'm not coming back. I made up me mind to go after me father and I'm going. Not in my wagon. I don't want your wagon anymore. You can't take a wagon over the desert because you can't take any oxen. Why? Because they drink too much. Who told you that? I did, Inkoosi. What are you doing here? [Kathy] I brought him. Look, Kathy, I don't know what this man's been telling you, but I give you my word no one can cross that desert. How does the Inkoosi know? I'm gonna try. I'm not afraid. The Inkoosikas is ready. I'm in charge here. Clear out! Wait, we can't let these 2 go alone, but why shouldn't we go with them? Good suggestion. Solves the problem. I won't have it. Nobody's asking you. I thought you wanted to go hunting. You know, hunting, fishing, anything with a little adventure in it. Do you know how men die for lack of water? Thirst, burning thirst that turns to pain. Torture, then you go mad and the sun kills you. Imaginative fellow, isn't he? Quartermain. I'm sorry our trip's had to end like this. How do you mean "end"? We'll be away for some time. Can't ask you to wait for us. Sir Henry Curtis, I was engaged to take you upcountry and to bring you back to the best of my ability. I happen to be a man who respects a contract. I'm lining up with the rest of you. You're a good fellow, Quartermain. On the contrary, I'm a fool. How are your feet? All right. How are yours? Fine. Nice about our feet, isn't it? Are you really going all through this just for diamonds? The Inkoosi says so. I didn't say anything. I'm asking you. Why is Inkoosi going? Blessed if I know. You're not one for a bit of gossip, are you? The mountains don't seem to get any nearer, do they? No, they don't, do they? No... no, they... No, they don't. Feeling better? Must you keep on asking me? I needn't. I'd sure miss it if you didn't. How long will the water last? Tomorrow. If I... If I don't get another chance, I'm sorry about everything. What are those birds up there? [Umbopa] Assvogels. They must be to live in a place like this. We call them "the bird that smells death." Huh? Oh. Good! Come here. O’Brien wagon. Go back and keep her talking. Fetch the others. [Henry] That's the last ration of water. Half a bottle each. That's good, I... I see by the map that we ought to get to pan bad water by midday tomorrow. Why's it called "pan bad water"? Because in 300 years it may have dried up. Oh... Oh, I see, yes. Go on, drink it.

Would you say that she was well-preserved? Reminds me of my poor old aunt Hannah. She came to no good. [Speaking Kukuana] She asks why the white man's servant walks like a prince?
