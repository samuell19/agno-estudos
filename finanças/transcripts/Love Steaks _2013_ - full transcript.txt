We expected you for two thirty. Really? - Yes. Went to the beach? - I was...no... Usually I'm quite punctual. Always on time? I'm sure. Let's be off, then. Oh, the lady with the glasses. There she goes. Just pull, I think. Right. Sorry. - Sorry. M'? Yes, basically I'm a physiotherapist. Nice. - But I also do manual therapy. That sounds nice, we should all come and see you! Where do I go? - That'll be your realm. I think it'll do for the time being. With luck you might find somewhere to stay outside. Mightn't be too bad either. - Yes. There's no bathroom here, which is a nuisance. It's a great space though. - True, and a great view. Know the changing rooms? Or will you change here? Right here? May I leave...? Yes, I'll leave before you take off your trousers though! Right. - Right! Private spa, and facials. Body treatments. "Did you like the treatment, found it soothing?" Always try to establish a personal contact. Always try to establish a personal contact. It's the connection that makes a guest feel like home. I shouldn't really be touching this... We'll take it along for cleaning immediately. Unfold mm so the client can change behind it. Just a classic screen. - Quite. Hello... I'd... before we begin... I'd like to present our products. As you show the products to the client... We had to be taught as well, that's how you do it. Like this you take off excess energy. It's important to shovel off to your side, not on yourself. Never approach the genital region. Never rest there. You don't take energy there? - Ne, it's taboo. The genital region is totally taboo. Scent next? Right? - No, later. So it's the shoulders next? - Precisely. You start from below, stop. From below here... you begin... You go like this, so as not to... Not quite as close. Up a bit. So she still gets some daylight. Remember your gnocchi. Table 61! 'Table 61!" Grease fusion... More grease. Lara, look what you did! - “that? Look at this mess! - “that? Proud of yourself? Makes me sick! Can't leave you alone! You're such a pain! - Get the mop and clean up. You get the mop and clean up! Marcel will clean up. Marcel, look what you did! You're more trouble than it's worth. I wipe the ﬂoor for the stupid cow. For the princess... Just because she's blonde she thinks she's superior... Really. I'd have liked to be born with tits. To get some idiot to scrub ﬂoors for me. Sign here? All this work wasted. Just because you're lost in thought. What are you thinking of? Not cookery. You're sweating! A bit revolting. Oh well. It's smelly, but not too... No wonder in such a stuffy room. E mm I'll get you covered. That's nice. That's not it... That's it. Yes, we're getting in position. Alright if I tug a bit on the leg? Or is it unpleasant on the hip? Mrs Weiss? Mrs Weiss? I'll go on. Put in the rest? Do the peppers need another couple of minutes? Yes, add the rest. Present on the house. From service. You share presents, right? What do we drink to? To friendship! Right, finished? Off we go. Here you are. - Thanks. I'd really love to jump in. Sissy! Scared? What about? - Jump in. M E Open up. We got locked out. Got locked out. It's shut upstairs. Your shoes... You have to go through with it. You went only half-way. Now take off your trousers. Take them off! Get them off! Get your trousers off, Clemens. Hello. - Hello. Good morning. - Morning. Got evicted, or why are you sleeping here? Ms Abendroth put me up here. Oh, right? There must be a reason then. Have a nice clay! - You too. Alright? Back to work. And you'd better be quick. Come and help, before getting up to mischief again. Service! Service, please! Delicious. I love it. Great, unfortunately. Honestly, but... You owed me one. Take off the mask, and stop fooling. Or I'll send you off to the circus, get it? Take it off! Take off the mask! Enough now! Enough! Are you alright? I'm arresting you on suspicion of drunk driving. Come off it! You must be pulling my leg. Oh, I made a mess. I want those! They're.. Calm down! Stop it now! Pull up your right foot! Behave yourself. Or you'll get to know me. Quite. Are you alright? I'll help you. Honestly! Lara, you puked all over yourself. Where's the exit? Exit? First get dressed. You said I didn't know how to dance. But it's you who can't dance. Saying it was me... No, pants first. Lara, first the pants. Give me that. Wear at least something. If you don't fancy it, get in your oar and go home. Oh, you can't. Get on your bike, no... Steffi, Maik, is there still a bus? No? Just slap-in-the-face taxis. What's the matter here? Is this where you live? It's my place! - No way. Tell me Clementine... Have you got my container? My drinks container, I can't find it. You mean this metal thing? Yes. Play something. Clemens, I don't know. Would you come along? - Where to? Let's see. It's really pretty, the colours. Don't they all look the same? Look, Clemens, it's about having fun! Imagine we're pirates. On the high seas! Robbing people! Take this! Hurry, Clemens! Row faster, man! lam! We have to jump! Come on! Service, please! This is... Tiaré. Slightly more tart... It's better for... - Lily is nice, too. ? E Yes, it's a pretty plant. How nice. It opens up... It's so good! You liked this one, didn't you? Let's see: I like coconut, and you Tiaré. Let's mix them up. - Right. - That'll be nice. Let's do that. - Should I undress? Mrs Seefeld? - Yes, I'm still here. Whatever you're most comfortable with. So what do I do now? Ah, lie down? How nice. Mrs Seefeld, would you mind taking your hand...? Mrs Seefeld... Stay on your tummy... - No. I'd like to be on my back now. I'd better get you covered, right? Mrs Seefeld, don't, please. Take your arm... You're really doing this well. There's a king dancing... with his people. Lara? Spare some time for me? Just a second... Hello. Look at what you're wearing. - I know. You can't just barge in on an event. What went into her? She probably just fancied you. She probably got excited, with you kneading her neck... The massage felt nice, and you get these scented oils... And you're rather damn good looking, come on, relax... I'm fine, it's just... That'll take your mind off. - I can't drink this. Why not? - I can't drink it. Did she apologise? - Of course not! Because she didn't feel guilty. Quite, she can come up, pay, and do whatever... If you don't let her know she's doing something improper... She'll do it again, of course. Well, I don't... the client... Go and sit there, talk to her. I can't. - Go on! Go and talk to her instead of me! Go and talk! - No, I can't. Hail King Thomas! Hip hip! Hooray! Cheers! Hip hip! Hooray! Hip hip! Hooray! Hip hip! Hooray! Cheers! - Cheers! Right, now! Idiot. Lara! It really blew out of proportion... I had to... I honestly had to... protect my... it went as far as my privates. Well, the therapist should be dispassionate. Right, and if it ever happens again... You can definitely tell the client... that her behaviour makes you uneasy. And ultimately you may stop the treatment. Hi. I brought you something. I don't eat meat. We call this the Makani area. Makani derives from Hawaii for... Wind. Blind? - Wind. We have to turn right now. Just wait before you undress... What we'll do is: I use a towel as cover, and... Once you're undressed, you rest on the stretcher... Get comfortable, and I'll get you covered. Ready - Alright? Yes, go on. How ridiculous, that they make you... stare into this shitty beach-scape, can't you take it away? Ms a Yes, yes. Who on earth gets these ideas? - Remove it? What's this naughty sound? I am preparing my arms. A bit stronger... A bit... Could you massage my bum? Standing in the kitchen is such a strain. Over here, a bit? Lots of oil, lots. It'll stain your undies. Push it into the slit. Push it in properly. Pull it in. With oomph. I'll do you now, with lots of oil. Don't be so clumsy, Clemens! I'm not sure, why every massage ends up in such a situation. My training certainly didn't prepare me for that. It's you, and your aura. You're oozing pure sex, Clemens. It's what you reﬂect. Grab them properly. Grab what? - My bum cheeks. They've been naughty. Actually, they'd deserve a beating. Would you mind giving them a smack? ? E Your bum? - Yes. Just the left cheek. The right one has been good. The left one needs it... Clemens! Harder! Mung If Mrs. Adenauer saw this I'd get the boot, I know. No! Please don't. Are you gay? Don't worry. I'm not gay. Really? Faggot, faggot, faggot! Do you think I don't know you're kidding me? I'm not taking the piss. Oh, it's spoilt the mood. Come here. We should rub up against each other. Rub? - Rub up against each other. Harder, rub up against me! 'I? gay, Clemens, we should lick each other's face. It doesn't discharge... - Just join in, please! Now you take hold of this rascal... You can rub it into each one of these hot bastards. Things alright? How's the love life? How about you? Love-wise? Don't change the subject. There's nothing happening. Really? - Love-wise. Noticed how the weirdo downstairs looks at you? Who? - Don't know his name. They're all weirdoes! - Right... Not the really ugly one. Actually I slept with them all, I should know whom you mean. You mean the new guy, probably? - Yeah. Slept with him as well? No! No! No way! How long has he been here? He's quite new. - No-one presents himself anymore. He's embarrassed. He's quite shy. With his looks, I'd be shy as well. Just a sec... thank you! Thanks. Just for the two of us. To run wild. This will be our secret hideaway And I'm no longer Lara, but Frau Schmelzing. Ms Schmefing? -Yes. And you're Herr Pollozek. You have to do whatever I want. Get it? Sorry... Hello... sorry... (an Nice and cosy retreat... I thought you'd be with guests. Or is it your break? Mr Pollozek was just showing me something. What is it? If you retreat, make sure not to get caught. Don't leave the door open. Keep it shut, and don't make a noise. As you should attend our guests, or work. That's what counts, right? Film Hm [Egg But retreating and taking an unauthorized break... taking your pulse and whispering sweet nothings... With one dressing down you know, right? Next time you'll get a real clobbering that'll bring tears to your eyes. Right? You're here to perform. And you're still on assessment? Aren't you? - Right. Well, young friend, you don't veer during assessment. You just walk in a straight line to avoid notice. Whether it be positive or negative. That's best. I'm sure you've taken in what I said... Raise your voice, yes? - Yes! Fine. Let's forget about it then. I'm sorry. My eyes are sharp. One last piece of advice: The fox never sleeps, it just dozes. Just so you know. Wherever your hideout, I'll find you. Watch the way I bow. I'd rather not catch you next time. Bye, Herr Winter. At the count of three we leap. - Ne! Say shit. Louder. Shout it into the sea. Go on. Shit! - Once more! Again. What was that? Again, go on. Sauteed vegetables, puree... Purée of sweet potatoes... Mashed potatoes... Cucumber salad. - Nd? This is where... It's still hot. - Yes, careful. Amazing. Have you got a ﬂesh or a blood penis? I'm really interested. This thing about the penis when it's cold. Which one is the blood penis? A blood penis starts off quite small. Well not really small, but average. And as it gets stiff, it really grows in length and girth. Whereas a blood penis is already huge when limp. And they don't grow much as they stiffen. Flesh or blood? Blood penis. Bite off until it matches. Roughly like that. Well, it's a blood penis, see. How big does it get if you touch it? Like this? Roughly? - Roughly, Yes- Well... That's really... I'd love to see it. As it... As you set it free from your underpants... while watching pleasant movies... and you... do this... - But... It tends to point upwards. Yes, that's it. - Lick it. I'd just like to imagine I'm getting my penis licked. Just for an instance. Please. Again, again! Like choking... Get in there. Nice and cold, right? That's not it yet, go on. It's getting colder. - Yes, go on. Right, and now... Now sling this under your armpits... Cold meat under your armpits. And pack this on your penis. Cover your penis in salmon, nice salmon. Ouch, this is very cold! And this in your bum! - Yes, it's got in. This in your mouth, get it in your mouth! And this for your nipples! Otherwise it won't get small. I want to see it shrink. Now let's see! Now it's really cold. Really cold. - May I touch? Shit! The meat... Bite it off with your teeth! You can't just come in here... Hey, at the back! But not here at hand-out. I brought you some calenclula for your bruises. For your legs. No... it's only a scratch. Listen, Prince Valium! We're busier here, than you downstairs. We don't do noon till 4pm, we do 10am till 11 at night. If you want to apply cream on someone, you register with me first, and I'll get a trial run. And then you can do someone else, right? I'll also volunteer. - Got it? Thanks. Come back later. Bye. You can form a ball. Which gets larger and larger. Automatically. And... then you can take it and throw it away. If I do a treatment, and realize there might be a drugs-related problem... Can you treat that with Chakras or energy ﬂows? If someone suffering from addiction admits to his addiction and is open to treatment by energy fields it's worth trying. But if they're on drugs or alcohol, I won't touch anyone, you never know how the energy would react. It would influence energies, perhaps negatively and the treatment might go overboard. Look, clean up, daddy wants to get home, don't fall asleep. And do better than yesterday, right? Not like that, let me. Let me! Somehow like the homo prince... Then you do it. - No, it's your task. You're the trainee. Skim it off... Skim off the water, can you manage? Got deaf and dumb now? Is E Go work in a cow shed, not with us. Alright now? - No. Leave off now. - Yes... Go home, piss off. Watch it. Thanks. Lara, you in one of your funny night-time moods? Got any toothpaste? Great. Lara, you drank again! I just... had a corporate... pang" You're such a nuisance! Think I can't take off my shoes by myself? Take off your hands! Good morning! - Good morning. Up you get! What's the matter? Gm? a Pick up the laundry, and bring it back in? While you sleep here? Well, they always say good morning. Oh my God! You don't remember anything? Well, at some point you ended up here. Right. How should I deal with your alcoholism? What? Cope with you saying you went to a company party? I work for the same outfit. So you think I have an alcohol problem? You have an alcohol problem. Alright, I'll no longer drink. But it's unfair. What's this? It's the betting finger. You've got one too. Show me your small betting finger. I'll stop boozing, you stop being timid. What do you mean? It's so obvious, whenever you're soared shit. When you hesitate, like a little baby fouling his nappy. They hold back, and concentrate brieﬂy. Then they let loose. I get the same feeling with you. You're such a coward. As if shitting your pants? Am I right? Deal? Bet! Now fuck me. You were so frightened! - Don't be mean. “My can't I...? - It's in your eyes. Guests only here. - I know. I really only... I feel quite positive about you. How nice. I'd love to know, I seem to have noticed... You got closer to a colleague from kitchens? The other day I caught you on lower ground... Hiding on the Ho Chi Minh path... Appears to ﬂourish... I hope... Hun“ Mates? - Right. When friendship turns into love Mr Pollozek, you hit the lucky draw. It may well happen. I'd prefer to meet up with you. See me? I'm telling you, work is work, private is private. I don't mingle privately with people with whom I work. I can't...l... You let him talk your head off! Not here, I can't... Can we go somewhere else? Confess your love for him. Tell him you dream of him at night. You wank off to his image. That he's the man of your dreams The lot. You hang around today. L...have... You're...my sexual... My sex fantasy. Alright, don't let anyone overhear us. My girl friend wouldn't be all too pleased... Find someone else, right. Now it's out. I won't mind. One last sip. - No. We'd better even it out. Otherwise it's too obvious. Right. A cross? - No, no cross. E p? Sorry. Maybe... We should start with your feet. That chair... Hello, Maik. $9 mu Emmy Fatso yourself, asshole! Oh, that's where you're hiding! Working. Even our elixir cherry, how amazing! Master Riedel, I wanted to ask about tomorrow, for 8. WWII you manage vegetarian dinner? What sort of cherry? Can you see a cherry anywhere? You got me. Piedmontese elixir cherry. I'll use a microphone next time. Could be intended as a compliment. Up to you. E m. What I wanted to say... To get the pleasure talk onto the right track... Ever heard of public indecency? On deck three. I'm not sure what happened, it's in full view, where your chum, Mr Pollozek is lodging. It wouldn't be appropriate if guests oversaw the nightly spectacle there. We're not keen on seeing another episode of Lemon Popsicle. None of your business. I hope you got me, I'm not joking. Thanks ever so much. We're not running a brothel. Cocksucker. - What did he want? What a cunt! Cunt doesn't describe it. Hello, Georg. Hello, Lara. Are you molesting me? Touching me up, Clementine. Imagine, across this lawn... Don't be distracted. Moss, grass, birds humming... This is one of the most diff cult exercises. Sitting calmly. Any idea where you get this? I think it's just my work. Where I have to perform with all my wits. Put your hands on your side. Try and avoid all the twitching you do. And tell me, why are all your channels always on full alert simultaneously? Any idea where it stems from? Don't lean on that. You have no idea what it's like in the kitchens? Do you want to experience how I feel? Put this on. You have no idea what this feels like. But Lara, again, just look, even now... Before we even begin... you're taking charge again. No, you should just know how it feels. Now clasp your hands... leave a gap of air between your palms. Sense the energy, and let it form into a ball. The minute your fingertips start touching... the circle is complete. Don't fill it up so much, makes it hard to pour later. I know. Marcel, the party we went to, know what Lara said? - Yeah? "Carry me to the car, and I'll drive you home." Not 'cause she was tired, but pissed. Do you drink decent stuff, or do you just want to get pissed? I'm drinking water. I don't believe you, you'd still hold your license. Bloody hell, just leave off? Shall I print out the bus timetable? Maybe the princess will get a pony to ride to work. What are you up to? It's my menstruation. It's not a fever. Breathe out, please. Why did you put milk in? Thanks, Clementine. Did you play with dolls? You look as if you might... Dolls or soldiers? - Soldiers. I don't believe it. You played with dolls. - Never. You painted dresses on your soldiers. No I didn't. Did you get beaten? Alright at school? Had spots? Your skin is actually quite good. Thick glasses? A limp? In care? No! - Smell bad? Were you the slowest? Clumsy? Dyslexic? I was chubby. Chubby or fat? Largeish. - Fat? So you were a fatso? - No, not really. But I was quite chubby, definitely. Fat and ﬂabby. Right, fat and ﬂabby. My mum always had pizza for breakfast. Five. Five? And we didn't get anything to eat. That can't be true. - Yes! She never left any for us. [us One day she was so hungry... she grabbed my little brother... I saw it with my own eyes. I came from the loo, the door was ajar... She grabbed my little brother... lifted him up by his little leg... from is little cot... and gulped him down. So this is proper black magic? Get in and look up to the sun. Well, can you feel it? (mm Wonderful! I'm a new person! I no longer crave... been not at all You have amazing aggressive potential, you know? You put in everything, and think you can cure me? With straw? It might look like a strange method, but... Precisely. And... And... are there any rules concerning alcohol? Indeed. No alcohol at work at all. None? - None. Unacceptable. Like when driving. I would hope. During work, no way, even if you're tempted. There's plenty about, and sometimes you could do with... We sell it all the time. Did he already taste your nectar? He makes a face, like this, look. H'? So what? What, so what? Do you let him fuck you? - Never mind, dear Marcel. Just tell me a bit! - What should there be? I don't know, there's rumors. - What rumours? That you fuck. - We fuck? Leave him be. I am. Ms E So shut up. Is this nice? Should I take off my top? - Raise your chest. The jacket? - Yes. Yes, my shoulder blades always... hurt. Him No, the back. Whatt sort of method is this now, Clem ens? Just relax a bit. I don't like it so close right now. Just massage my back, Clemens. Or the neck. What do you want? Get off! Lara, you...don't have to be in charge all the time. No! You're not going to...! Give me back the keys! Stop this nonsense now! And the car? What should I do now? You drink sometimes, don't you? - No! No! - Yes. No! - Honestly. Look, seriously. Seriously, it's really no good... Right. Differently put... - Go on. Lara... - What about, Lara? All of you must support Lara. - Support? With what? You're role models for her. - Course we are. Definitely. - Yes, fully qualified. There you are. Lara tries, too, talks a bit... What are you on about? Know something about her? Look, this is the kitchens, it's my department. Other chefs... You downstairs have to... older women and men... You downstairs have to... older women and men... That's your task. Got it, so far. But a colleague of yours... - We'll take care of Lara. She needs your help... Why shouldn't we notice when she needs help? My,“ Lara's in serious trouble. We can watch her, no problem. Don't worry, dear. M m It's not a good idea. - We need that for cooking. You're not just cooking it. There's these little gulps... that mess up Lara. Chief, he's about to nick our alcohol. May I take the booze from the box? What alcohol? What for? - Kitchen's off limits! What do you need it for? The stuff isn't fit to drink. But people drink it, I know. No one drinks, just Perrier, right chief Right, no one drinks here. Look, it's the food safety area. Get going- Come on, now! - Lara. Lara! I'm not sure... Don't shit in your pants! It's not really a good idea! It's wrecked anyway. No way will I do it! Someone's got to do it. It's romantic. Our pirate ship's burning! I listened to Andrea Berg in the car this morning. Good German musk. - Ream? Can you sing your favourite song? "Feelings are confidential." Sing it. - No, I can't . Then say the words, make it sound like a poem I can't either, "Feelings are confidential", "I'm not showing my real feelings..." That's it. Miss Schmelzing, Mr Herbrich, what's this racket? Sit down. I found things in your work place. Even when you were there by yourself. This morning I inspected the lockers. This is what I found. Obviously you have a major problem. It's got to change immediately. Or I'll need to change something soon. May I say something? It's mine, definitely. But the stuff is a bit older. My mother is quite ill, She fell out of bed, she suffers from obesity. Dreadful cholesterol levels, and her heart... Had to take down the door to take her through. But this is not helping either. I'm making progress, it won't happen again. I meditate and run... If ever I notice any of this again... it'll be the last time. Right? - Right. M E Stop drinking. - Thanks. Never mind? - Right. Come here. ? E I'm busy preparing drinks. What is it? Did you tell Mr Popp I had a drinks problem? - No. Swear it. - What for? Someone did mention it, yes. I don't think we should discuss it here, though. Who? Ask Clemens. Right, thanks. Want to come in? No, just wanted to say good bye, I got fired. Fired? Mr Popp gave me the sack, said I mustn't come back. I've had it, here at the hotel. Someone double crossed me. I wouldn't know who, in the kitchens. They're all friends, I trust them. Don't worry. Could be worse. Look, I had a chat with Mr Popp. Not about you, just to advise he shouldn't leave... Em E Your name didn't come up, I just said... So what makes him think of me? Because you're drunk all the time! I'm gonna hit your gob, piss off! Brilliant! Clemens the healer! He didn't mean it, he'll help. I'm convinced he's not going to sack you. Leave, piss off! You really need help. Right, I've got the minutes in front of me. Anything I missed after I'd left the last meeting? Let's brieﬂy go over it, then discuss building works and the pool. Well, in the spa area, workshop, my own office, lights didn't get switched off quite frequently in recent times. I'm sick of having to tell people when to switch on or off... Makes me go blue... Franzel will try to come back Saturday. After Easter... The week after Easter. Anything else? Ensure there's sufficient personnel... Mr Emersleben, we don't know yet? We're in session! Sorry... Mr POPP--- I saw you and I told you... about a problem in your section... and you have nothing better to do than... giving a young lady the sack, who's got a problem... Sack? You were young once, you too, Mr Schmidt! Mr Schmidt still is! What is it? I don't get it, if, if a young person has a problem, You should help them, not dismiss them. It's morally wrong. I don't get your ethics. As long as you leave me be, you can do as you please. - But she's leaving you be! No. Calm down. If it interferes with my department and my work, it interferes with my life. A problem could be an opportunity. Fifi a Not just "quite"! I'm not shutting up, I kept quiet too long! Finished interrupting the meeting? I hand in this stuff. M Em Right. Thanks. He resigned. He did what? - He resigned. He took his work clothes. Placed them on the table, and... gm? E But... Marcel, would you finish the soup? - No, why. Miss Schmelzing, you stay! Wait! You bloody coward! Leave me be! Subtitles: alias film & sprachtransfer
