NOT NOW, FABIUS. I'D LIKE TO TAKE MY BATH. HA HA HA. BATHING, MOTHER FABIA, IS AN HONORABLE ROMAN CUSTOM. NOT THE WAY YOU DO IT. IF THE GODS HAD WANTED US TO PROPEL OURSELVES THROUGH WATER, THEY'D HAVE PROVIDED US WITH FINS. OH, NOW, MOTHER. WHAT'S WRONG? I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR BUYING ME. YOU HAVE A VERY STRANGE WAY OF SHOWING YOUR GRATITUDE. HAVEN'T YOU ANY MANNERS AT ALL? NO, I'M A BARBARIAN. WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE SO PROUD OF IT. THE STABLE AREA IS IN THAT DIRECTION.

RUSH ME? WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED FOR 7 YEARS. YOU SET A GOAL FOR YOURSELF, AND I DIDN'T WANT TO INTERFERE WITH IT. MY DEAR, TODAY I AM DICTATOR OF ALL ROME.

I'LL CALL SOME FRIENDS TOGETHER, AND WE'LL ANNOUNCE OUR WEDDING TONIGHT. FABIUS. YES, MY LOVE? IT'S A VERY GREAT HONOR TO BE THE MISTRESS OF ROME, BUT... I JUST WONDER IF I'M SUITED TO IT. I THINK YOU ARE. UNLESS, OF COURSE, YOU PREFER TO ENTER THE TEMPLE OF VESTA. A VESTAL VIRGIN? WHAT, SHUT UP IN A TEMPLE FOR 30 YEARS WITH NOTHING TO DO BUT TEND A FIRE? HA HA HA HA.

ONLY THIS MORNING I PROMISED VICTORY. ONLY THIS MORNING 12 ROMAN LEGIONS WERE WIPED OUT, ANNIHILATED. HANNIBAL RULES THE WORLD. Man: BUT THE SOOTHSAYER REPORTED THE OMENS WERE PROPITIOUS. THE GODS ARE ON OUR SIDE. THE GODS MAY BE ON OUR SIDE, BUT HANNIBAL HAS ELEPHANTS. WHAT ARE YOUR ORDERS? CALL A MEETING OF THE SENATE TO DETERMINE A COURSE OF ACTION. IN THE MEANTIME, RALLY YOUR REMAINING FORCES, JOIN THEM WITH THE HOME LEGIONS. ALL WOMEN MUST TAKE IMMEDIATE SHELTER BEHIND THE WALLS OF ROME. TO FALL INTO THE HANDS OF HANNIBAL IS A FATE WORSE THAN DEATH. CONDUCT THE LADY FABIA TO ROME IMMEDIATELY. AND PROCEED CALMLY, EVERYONE. YOU CAN STAY WITH MOTHER. A FATE WORSE THAN DEATH. I CANNOT UNDERSTAND IT. WE OUTNUMBERED THEM 2 TO 1. IF WE'D HAVE OUTNUMBERED THEM 5 TO 1, HE STILL WOULD HAVE BEATEN US. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE HANNIBAL, FABIUS. I'VE SEEN HIM IN BATTLE. THIS IS NO ORDINARY BARBARIAN. HE HAS THE STRENGTH OF 10, THE COURAGE OF 20. HE'S MORE THAN A MAN. HE'S A GOD. [MARCHING MUSIC PLAYING] WE CONQUERED GAUL. GAUL! GAUL! WE CONQUERED SPAIN! SPAIN!

YOU DIDN'T HAPPEN TO SEE ANYTHING OF THE LITTLE SLAVE GIRL, DID YA? ABOUT SO HIGH, BIG BROWN EYES, GOLDEN FUZZY HAIR? HOLD YOUR TONGUE, SLAVE. I CAN THINK OF ONLY ONE THING: AMYTIS HAS BEEN CAPTURED BY HANNIBAL'S FORCES. SHE WOULD KILL HERSELF FIRST. ROME. FOR 10 YEARS I'VE DREAMED OF HER LYING AT MY FEET. AND THERE SHE IS-- HELPLESS AND BEAUTIFUL. YOU THINK SHE'S BEAUTIFUL, AND YET TOMORROW YOU INTEND TO DESTROY HER. IT DOES SEEM A SHAME, DOESN'T IT? TO DELIBERATELY DESTROY SOMETHING YOU ADMIRE.

MORE THAN I CAN REMEMBER. HOW DO YOU GO ABOUT IT? I MEAN, WHAT'S IT LIKE? WELL, THERE ARE NO HARD AND FAST RULES IN WARFARE, BUT I'D SAY THE FIRST THING IS TO MAKE A COMPLETE SURVEY OF THE ENEMY. OH, YES. KNOW HIS STRENGTH AS YOU KNOW YOUR OWN. THEN DEPLOY YOUR FORCES. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN? PUT THEM IN THE RIGHT POSITION. OH. OH, I SEE. PUT THEM IN THE RIGHT POSITION. THEN, UH, THEN WHEN YOU'VE DEPLOYED SUFFICIENTLY, YOU, UH, YOU MAKE A FEINT AT HIS STRENGTH. I DON'T UNDERSTAND. WELL, YOU, UH... PRETEND TO ATTACK, BUT YOU DON'T. YOU, UH, FALL BACK INSTEAD. AHH. YOU FALL BACK. YES. THEN, UH... WHEN HE ADVANCES, YOU ENCIRCLE HIM. YOU STRIKE AT HIS WEAKNESS HARD AND QUICK. SUPPOSE HE HAS NO WEAKNESS? THAT WOULD BE VERY UNUSUAL. IT SOUNDS EXCITING. IT IS.

BRIGHTEN THEM UP A BIT, HMM? IT WAS SUGGESTED BY A CLOSE FRIEND OF THE HEROIC HANNIBAL THAT OUR 800 ELEPHANTS BE PAINTED... BRIGHT COLORS. BRIGHT COLORS? OOH. HE SAID 800. I DIDN'T SEE 800 ELEPHANTS. ALL WE HAVE IS 60, BUT YOU KNOW HISTORIANS. IT'S BEEN A WONDERFUL DAY. WONDERFUL. TELL ME, IF I SPARED ROME... AND RETURNED TO CARTHAGE, WOULD YOU COME WITH ME? I DON'T KNOW. I NEED TIME TO THINK. YOU HAVE YOUR LIFE. I HAVE A LIFE, TOO. THERE ARE THINGS I MUST CONSIDER. WHAT THINGS? WHAT IS YOUR LIFE? WHO ARE YOU? I'M A ROMAN WOMAN... IN LOVE WITH A CARTHAGINIAN GENERAL. [FANFARE] A DELEGATION FROM ROME, SIRE, UNDER AN OLIVE BRANCH OF TRUCE. LED BY THE DICTATOR FABIUS MAXIMUS. [COMMOTION AMONG THE TROOPS] LET THEM APPROACH. I AM FABIUS MAXIMUS, DICTATOR OF ROME. I AM HANNIBAL OF CARTHAGE, CONQUEROR OF THE WORLD. I HAVE WITH ME PROPOSED ARTICLES OF TRUCE. STEP INTO MY TENT. WE'LL DISCUSS TERMS. I'M PLEASED THAT YOU'RE IN A RECEPTIVE MOOD, GENERAL. I WARN YOU. I MAY BE LESS RECEPTIVE WHEN I HEAR YOUR PROPOSAL. UH, COULDN'T WE BE ALONE? THIS IS MY TENT. YOU MAY SPEAK FREELY. UH, SHE'S DEAF AND DUMB. OH. HEH HEH. NOBLE HANNIBAL, FOR YEARS, ROME AND CARTHAGE HAVE BEEN AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS. THOUSANDS OF MEN ON BOTH SIDES HAVE SACRIFICED THEIR LIVES. AT THIS MOMENT, THE CONFLICT SEEMS TO HAVE REACHED WHAT I MAY VENTURE TO CALL A CRISIS. YOU ARE NOT OVERSTATING. YOU UNDOUBTEDLY DO NOT REALIZE THE FULL STRENGTH OF OUR DEFENDING FORCE. WE HAVE WITHIN THE CITY, FULLY ARMED, 23 WAR-STRENGTH LEGIONS. 2. YOU MUST REALIZE THAT THE WALLS OF ROME ARE IMPREGNABLE. I, UH... I BELIEVE THERE'S A BREAK SOMEPLACE. WELL, WHAT WOULD BE GAINED BY A PROLONGED AND ARDUOUS SIEGE? NOTHING BUT ACUTE SUFFERING ON BOTH SIDES. THEN CONSIDER ALSO THE INNOCENT VICTIMS. THINK OF THE WOMEN AND CHILDREN. I AM. WHAT DO YOU SUGGEST WE DO ABOUT IT? I SUGGEST THAT YOU ABANDON YOUR MAD SCHEME OF CONQUERING ROME. I SEEM TO HAVE HEARD THOSE WORDS BEFORE. THEY'RE WISE WORDS. THE ATTEMPT WOULD COST YOU HEAVILY AND BE DOOMED TO ULTIMATE FAILURE. I'LL GIVE THE MATTER SOME THOUGHT. THANK YOU, GENERAL. HOWEVER, MY DECISION MAY NOT DEPEND ENTIRELY UPON MYSELF. VERY NICE. YOU MAY RETURN TO YOUR CITY AND AWAIT MY WORD. MAY I ADD IT TO MY COLLECTION? UH, WELL... YOU HESITATE? OH, FORGIVE ME, GENERAL, BUT THE MEDALLION CARRIES A SENTIMENTAL VALUE. IT CONTAINS THE LIKENESS OF MY BETROTHED. YOUR CONCERN IS UNDERSTANDABLE. YOU MAY KEEP IT. NO. TAKE IT. SHE WOULD WANT YOU TO HAVE IT. GIVE THE DICTATOR SAFE ESCORT. SAFE ESCORT FOR THE DICTATOR! THIS IS FOR YOU, A PRESENT FROM THE DICTATOR OF ROME. IT IS BEAUTIFUL, ISN'T IT? I WONDER HOW IT OPENS. OH--OH, I DON'T THINK IT DOES. THEY RARELY DO. IT'S A LOST ART. THE OLD WINDBAG SAID IT CONTAINED A LIKENESS OF HIS BETROTHED. NO. NO, I DON'T THINK SO. PROBABLY SOME DOOFUS GIRL. BETROTHED... TO THE DICTATOR... OF ROME. BETROTHED... TO THE DICTATOR OF ROME! I CAN EXPLAIN EVERYTHING. SO THAT'S WHY YOU CAME. I DIDN'T! TO SPY FOR YOUR LOVER. THAT'S NOT TRUE, AND HE'S NOT MY LOVER. IF YOU'LL ONLY-- YOU EVEN SANG THE SAME TUNE-- SPARE ROME. LISTEN. WHEN MY FATHER DIED, HE MADE FABIUS MY PROTECTOR. THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO. IT WAS MARRY HIM OR BECOME A VESTAL VIRGIN. HA HA HA HA! YOU DON'T KNOW ROMAN LAW. NO, BUT I KNOW ROMAN WOMEN. YOU DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT WOMEN. IF YOU DID, YOU'D KNOW I LOVE YOU, ONLY YOU. HAVE YOU FORGOTTEN THE DAY I HELD YOUR LIFE IN MY HANDS? DON'T DO THAT! OH! OF ALL THE BLIND, OBSTINATE PIG-- HOW COULD A MAN BE SO BRILLIANT IN WAR AND SO STUPID IN PEACE? WATCH YOUR TONGUE, WOMAN! AND STOP SNATCHING THINGS, YOU BARBARIAN! YES... YES, I AM! AND I LOVE IT! YOU DON'T WANT A MATE. YOU WANT A SLAVE, JUST SOMETHING ELSE TO EXHIBIT WITH ALL THE REST OF YOUR BLOODSTAINED LOOT. YOU FLATTER YOURSELF. YOU'RE NOT WORTH EXHIBITING. I'VE GOT OTHER PLANS FOR YOU. MAGO! YES. I'LL DESTROY ROME, AND I WON'T LEAVE A STONE UPON A STONE. MAGO! I'LL PULVERIZE IT! I'LL GRIND IT TO OBLIVION! OF COURSE YOU WOULD. THAT'S WHAT I'D EXPECT OF YOU. TAKE THIS WOMAN OUT AND PUT HER IN CHAINS. TOMORROW, I'LL DELIVER YOU TO YOUR LOVER PERSONALLY AND THROW YOU AT HIS FEET-- BOUND AND GAGGED. OUT! WHAT ARE YOU DOING? DON'T ASK QUESTIONS. I NEVER SAID A WORD, I SWEAR. YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO. HE SAW ME HANGING AROUND FABIUS' NECK. ALRIGHT. COME ON. BUT--BUT WHERE? COME ON. COME ON, HURRY UP. WHERE? NEVER MIND. HURRY UP. HURRY UP WHERE? TO ROME. BUT WHAT ABOUT MY LADY? I'M SORRY. SHE'S HANNIBAL'S PROBLEM. WHEN WE CONQUER THE CITY, I'LL FIND YOU. WE CAN GO AWAY TO CARTHAGE TOGETHER. YOU DON'T WANT TO BE A SLAVE ALL YOUR LIFE, DO YOU? YOU MEAN, IF I COME WITH YOU, I WON'T BE? WELL, THE WIFE OF THE BEST LIEUTENANT IN HANNIBAL'S ELEPHANT CORPS CAN HARDLY BE A SLAVE. DID YOU SAY...WIFE? WELL, YOU LOVE ME, DON'T YOU? YES. Man: PATROL, RIGHT! IT'S THE MORNING PATROL. GET BACK. THEY'VE GONE. NOW QUICK. WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT ARE YOU DOING? META. META. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? CHAIN ME UP AGAIN. OF ALL THE SILLY, STUBBORN... ALRIGHT. I WILL. GIVE ME YOUR ANKLE. UHH! THE PRISONERS ARE ESCAPING! SOUND THE ALARM! THERE SHE GOES! THERE SHE GOES! GET HER! GET THAT WOMAN! COME ON! AFTER THEM! ALIVE! I WANT HER ALIVE! FORM YOUR BATTALION! EVERY MAN, HORSE, AND ELEPHANT. WE ATTACK ROME. WHEN? NOW! [CHEERING] WE ATTACK ROME! "ON THE EVE OF THE BATTLE, "THE HEROIC HANNIBAL'S HORSE WAS STOLEN BY A FORMER FRIEND." META! AROUND THE ROCK. HIDE BEHIND THE ROCK. I'LL SEE YOU IN ROME. HANNIBAL SAID TO TAKE HER ALIVE. ALIVE OR DEAD-- LET'S TAKE HER. NOW! AH! [GASPING] OH! A RIDER APPROACHES! AMYTIS CATAENEUS, BETROTHED TO THE DICTATOR OF ROME. OPEN THE GATES! AH, AMYTIS, MY POOR DARLING. FABIUS, YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN THROUGH. NOW, NOW. IT'S ALL OVER. WE WON'T TALK ABOUT IT. YOU'RE IN ROME AGAIN, SAFE WITH ME. YES. I'M IN ROME AGAIN... WITH YOU. AND I HAVE GOOD NEWS. THE SITUATION LOOKS MUCH BRIGHTER. I, UH, JOURNEYED TO HANNIBAL'S CAMP PERSONALLY. I BELIEVE I'VE CONVINCED HIM TO SPARE ROME. I WOULDN'T COUNT ON IT. WHAT? I MEAN... BARBARIANS CAN BE... TREACHEROUS. WAR OR NO WAR, I INTEND TO GO AHEAD WITH OUR PLANS. WE'LL BE MARRIED TOMORROW. THEN IF HANNIBAL ATTACKS, IF ROME IS DESTROYED, WE CAN BE BURIED TOGETHER AS MAN AND WIFE. BURIED TOGETHER. FABIUS... I CAN'T MARRY YOU. W-WHAT DO YOU MEAN? I DON'T UNDERSTAND. I'VE DECIDED TO TAKE THE OTHER CHOICE. YOU MEAN INTO THE TEMPLE OF VESTA, DEDICATE 30 YEARS OF YOUR LIFE? YOU CAN'T. IT WAS YOUR SUGGESTION. YES, BUT I NEVER THOUGHT-- I--I DIDN'T MEAN IT. I MEAN IT, FABIUS. YOU...CARE SO LITTLE FOR ME? I CARE A GREAT DEAL. BUT I DON'T LOVE YOU. I SUPPOSE I ALWAYS KNEW. I'M SORRY. [MARCHING CADENCE] HANNIBAL! [FANFARE] CHARGE! FORWARD! CHARGE! CHARGE! SEND IN THE SMOKE CHARIOTS! ELEPHANT BATTALION! [ELEPHANT TRUMPETS] BURN IT DOWN! FORWARD! FIRE! BRING UP THE SCALING LADDER! AAH! Man: OHH! [ELEPHANT TRUMPETS] RELEASE CATAPULTS! FIRE! FIRE! FIRE THE CATAPULTS! FIRE! FIRE! FIRE! FIRE! WHAT IS THE SITUATION? DESPERATE. WE CAN'T HOLD UP. HOLD! HOLD! HOLD! WHAT ARE YOUR TERMS? ROME. I IMPLORE YOU TO BE REASONABLE. EXPECT NO REASON. OFFER NO TERMS. AMYTIS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING? THERE CAN BE NO TRUCE WITH BARBARIANS. THEY ACCEPT YOUR TERMS WITH ONE BREATH AND DESTROY YOU WITH THE NEXT. I STAND BESIDE YOU, FABIUS, AND I SAY FIGHT HIM. FIGHT HIM! FIGHT HIM! IT'S A WONDERFUL THING YOU ARE DOING, AMYTIS, BUT IT IS TOO LATE. IT'S HOPELESS. WILL YOU ACCEPT TRIBUTE? ROME OFFERS YOU SLAVES... SHIPS FOR YOUR RETURN TO CARTHAGE... HALF THE GOLD IN OUR COFFERS. WHAT IS YOUR ANSWER? I WILL ACCEPT TRIBUTE. [CHEERING] I WILL ACCEPT THAT WOMAN. Troops: OH, NO! OH, NO! NO, NO! [MEN GRUMBLING] WE HAVE MANY OTHER LOVELY WOMEN. THAT WOMAN OR NONE. THIS WOMAN IS ALREADY PROMISED. SHE WAS MY BETROTHED, BUT NOW SHE HAS DEDICATED HERSELF TO THE TEMPLE OF VESTA FOR LIFE. THEREFORE, SHE CANNOT BE A TRIBUTE. MAKE YOUR CHOICE. THE WOMAN... OR ROME. I CANNOT CONDEMN ANY WOMAN TO A FATE WORSE THAN DEATH. WHAT YOU ASK IS IMPOSSIBLE. THEN ROME MUST PERISH. [DRUMS BEAT] SOUND THE BUGLES! Amytis: WAIT! WAIT! WAIT! WHAT IS THE FATE OF ONE WOMAN COMPARED TO THE SAFETY OF A WHOLE CITY? FOR THE GLORY OF ROME, I WILL GO WITH HIM. [CHEERING] NO! EVEN YOU MUST MAKE A SACRIFICE, MY SON. FAREWELL, GOOD FABIUS. PEOPLE, DO NOT GRIEVE. IT'S BETTER THAT I GO WITH THIS FIEND THAN TO ALLOW OUR LOVELY CITY TO PERISH... AT HIS FOUL HANDS.
