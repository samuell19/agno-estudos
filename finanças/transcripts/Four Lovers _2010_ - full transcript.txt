In life, even when you're happy, you want something new to come along, some kind of distraction. Rachel, I'm off. See you tomorrow. Yeah, sure. See you tomorrow. I'm leaving too. Hearts and skulls, I don't know. Ugly? It's the idea I find clichéd. I thought we'd add little glass mini-hearts a crown of That might be better See you tomorrow Do you have time go over the corrections with him? I want to see the stand. Okay, I'll stay. I can come back on Thursday We won't be long go online. The home page is nice and strong. But are the letters too big? Like it's for blind people? Not for me. I guess it's not too conspicuous. Was the coral your idea Excellent. Diane wants our customers to use a password so no one can steal our designs. That means no new customers. No newcomers Yeah we thought it over And the translations? For the show we need it all in English. For the rest, we'll see. I can ask my wife. She translates my Web sites We'll find the technical terms. Great. Did you get the pictures I sent you? Who modeled for you? Diane's cousin, why? No reason. You think she's ugly? Me too. Then get someone else. Why not you? You're very attractive. You have sex appeal I'm not 18. I can't model. How do you find the jewelry? I'm not a fan. It's unusual but too- - too Gothic for me Too Gothic for you? - This isn't Gothic. - The skulls. They're baroque not Gothic. Vanitas. It's too dark for me. Are you upset? I should have kept quiet. It'll help if you tell me her style How she dresses. Stuff like that. I'll show you a picture. This is Teri. English? No, her mom's American. These are the kids. Tim. Jerry, the cat. And Thelma. How old? - Ten. - You had her young. She wasn't planned. Here, Tim. Yes, Rachel? My husband is worried. Do you like spicy food? Vincent? I'll answer. Vincent. The Web guy? Yeah. Read it. You have to brush here. Where they lay the eggs. "Got an iron stomach. Teri." Who's she? His wife? An iron stomach? She means she eats everything. Feel it? I don't know. How should it feel? Burning. You're doing it too hard. My teacher in Beijing was 96 He did it harder than me. You were in Beijing? When? Seventeen years ago. I wish I'd done those Games. Olympic gymnastics? Of course. You did the Olympics? Seoul 1988. - A medal? - I was young. I panicked. I gave it up afterwards You never went back? To Beijing? No. Rachel isn't really big on Asia. That's not true. I like kamikazes. And I do his of Sudoku. You are a Sudoku. Meaning I don't add up. Not at all. Explain yourself. Forget it. Telephone! Rachel's. Hey, Diane. Damn! There's lots of bugs going around. Come on, don't worry. Take care. That was Diane. - Her girlfriend's sick. - What now? She's always sick. She must have mono or something. Or scurvy. - Shingles! - Exactly! - Down syndrome. - Sicko! It's bedtime. Come on, honey. - The floor? - I've got a backache. Is it our chairs? I often get it at night. The theater can be tough, otherwise it's nothing. Since having kids? It's her 10 years of gymnastics. Can I see? Don't move. I'll touch your vertebrae. Try to visualize. Lift up your hair and lean forward. The cervical first. One... Two... three... It shouldn't tickle. I had to get it out. Can we start over? Relax. Put your glass down Lower your head. The cervical... Five, six... Feel how the eighth is pointy? Now the lumbar. - What is it? - Sorry. Shit. - Sorry. - You're bleeding. It won't stop, but it doesn't hurt. Need any help? No, it's fine. What do you want? I don't know. Something I don't usually wear. What do you wear? Black, gray... I like blue too. The blue shirt. Turn around. We can shorten it. - I don't know. - Look. Better, isn't it? Stop by the studio. I'll fix it for you. “Turn your hands into embraces!“ I don't write that stuff. I mostly took the pictures. - The back massage? - Inside. You can take it. What is it? Shiatsu For Couples. We take clothes, books. What else? Can you sign it? Sure. This won't come out. We'll hide it under the couch. Got writer's block? I kissed Teri. Read it. Or is it personal? It's personal. But I'll read it. "For Teri and Vincent, old methods for our young friendship." Franck Berry. Nice. You need her maiden me. There can't be many gymnastics champions named Teri. How did they actually meet? Ask them. I think they were surfing. Those two are wild! Why not bungee jumping? And very hot. Her? No, him. He waxes here. I found her! Is that her? Impressive. Second in European juniors. First Olympic athlete I ever met Same here. So slender. See her joints? I did. - Neck, wrists. - I saw. I'll shorten her necklace-. When I massaged her, I could feel she had small bones. She was impressed by your massage I could tell I kissed Teri. She and I kissed. I left Franck's book out. Maybe Teri checked. If she did, she never mentioned it. The next time we saw them, she acted normally. She wasn't worried or guilty- - or overly excited. While Rachel tried to make us change our cocktails, - I tried to recall our first dinner together. When Diane called to cancel, was I relieved or disappointed? I can't remember. Did we all feel good together? Is it normal to feel so good, so quickly? Was there more to it? We don't have to. What? We don't have to. True. A little sugar or a lot? Come here. Touch me. Not asleep? I was waiting. How are you? I'm good. - And you? - I'm okay. No blood this time? Very funny. I'm teasing. I'm glad it went well with Teri. How is she? Fine, I think. And how's Vincent? He seems okay. So no one's hurt. We must be numb or something. You're in no pain? Not right now, anyway. Still find me pretty? Week after week- - we shared each other. It's late. It says so. We were free, and our freedom suited me perfectly. I refused to discuss rules or methods. For me, there was only one constraint. If we weren't all free, no one saw each other. Train strike, trip canceled. Want to see Franck? I often wondered why we never set any rules. Why we never needed to say what was allowed- - and what wasn't. Vincent made fun of me. He said we weren't inventing a new sport. No use laying down rules and regulations. Message for English speakers. Eurostar trains to London have been canceled. Sophie! Fill in for me. My daughter just fell They're talking about something virtual. Thanks a lot! We just had to manage one another's desires and taboos. Vincent and I agreed never to ask each other- - how we spent our time with Rachel or Franck. ♪ People wax on about the USA. ♪ ♪ And what they see on big screens. ♪ ♪ They constantly get carried away- ♪ ♪ - and consider Paris a hill of beans! ♪ ♪ All this talk can make you wild. ♪ ♪ So one day you ♪ ♪ want to test your luck. ♪ ♪ Another hungry man or child- ♪ ♪ - In New York out to make a buck. ♪ ♪ So the poor, they do depart. ♪ ♪ An emigrant, a broken heart ♪ ♪ Their eyes do quickly smart! ♪ ♪ Where did my Moulin Rouge go? ♪ ♪ Where's my café, ♪ ♪ where is my bistro? ♪ ♪ Every day used to seem aglow. ♪ ♪ Where are my friends from long ago? ♪ ♪ Where is my open-air dance? ♪ ♪ The accordions filling the skies. ♪ ♪ Howl long for my dear old France- ♪ ♪ - and a nice cheap ♪ ♪ cone of french fries! ♪ ♪ Where has it gone? ♪ When I came to France. A woman sold bread by my elementary school. She had a bob cut, pretty young, broad shoulders. I can't hear. You're early. I fell in love with her. I'd touch myself thinking of her. At Thelma's age? Thelma's just in primary school. Fantasized about French pastries. I dreamt she took me in the back- - and I sucked her breasts- - amongst flan sacks of flour and the bear. The bears? The gummy bears. The worst is that he hit FX. He's way too smart. Stop it. He called her... Good night, Salimata! Hey, Teri. Watching TV. Hold on. Hear that? The Grand Prix? God knows why Margot likes it. Can you hear? How does Franck sleep with you? Go on. Pressed against me And with you? I Can't. I get claustrophobic. Sometimes he puts an arm under me. Not like Vincent? He stays on his side. Pretending he's all alone. Not so far! What? Hold on tight I'm falling! Now you'll get hard again? That's the point. What time is it? 03:00. Sorry, I didn't see the time. I'll shower. - Let's push this back. - Sure. Over there? - Got to trash the place? - What? We weren't... We moved on purpose. Why? Because I'm writing a book. "Feng Shui for Couples" Bad vibrations here? It's sexual Feng Shui. Enhances virility and endurance. - Does it work? - A little. I'm testing it out. My wife's not a guinea pig! You know her. I mentioned it and she had to try. Listen, Franck I never asked Teri what you do. That's not my thing But don't leave any traces She left you a hint. Teri and I are fine. - I know. - I mean... We sleep together. It's fine. She's satisfied. She's not with you out of lack of satisfaction. I didn't think that. Bye, honey. Apologize for being late. Have a good day. So you're an interior decorator now? News travels fast. What happened? Nothing. We fell asleep, lost track of the time. Now that we're on it, how's it going with Vincent? Sexually. I wasn't talking sex. Come on, tell me. Tell you what? Does he have trouble? It's not smart to talk about this. He doesn't have any trouble... He has a hard time... Isn't this off limits? A hard time what? Coming. That's not a problem So it lasts long. Teri says it's different with me. She said so? What a nerve! Why different? Exactly. I don't get it. She must find you gentler. Seems your rubs are good foreplay. Seems? You discussed it with Vincent? I don't know, it just crept into the conversation. I know why he calls you a Sudoku. Why? You're hard to figure out. Your lines are unfinished. Are we seeing too much of each other? The two of us? The four of us. Margot! This is no good. Just a small cellar window. The cash register fits in here. But facing south. Especially in the winter. Where's south? I don't know. I'll pull out. Tim. Cover up. It's cold. Disappointed? Not at all. It's a relief. You want pictures? We'll show them to Vincent. Get in the picture. To give a sense of proportion. Go back a little. A little more. Great. What are they up to? I don't know. Teri wanted to show Franck something. It's for her day spa. God knows what they do. They hang out together. Soon they'll be choosing wallpaper. Stop thinking about them. What can they talk about? They just fuck. They talk, I swear. Teri told me. Of course they talk. They have nice, long conversations. Maby. About what? I don't know. - I want to call them. - That's not a good idea. What time is it? Around 03:30. I'm off to work, and you? Work too. It's not good to make me think of them. Sorry. Better to leave them be, okay? Really? Try it. It gives me a fat ass. Sportswear is out of the question Can we give it to Teri? She's not into sportswear It's more her style. Really? What's her style? American style! At ease with her body and with everyone. Feet on the table, hugs and kisses You're wrong. I never noticed that. What did you notice? First of all... - she's full of energy. She always says yes She tries I all, grabs every opportunity. Perfect girl scout That's stupid. In fact she's prodigal. She's prodigal. She has anal orgasms? What the hell are you talking about? - Know what prodigal means? - Sure! They're starting to cost us. - How many of us? - Seven. Give some to Margot. You lost weight. I don't think so. You know you did. Maybe a little. Come on, give me a break! What's the story? Nothing. Yeah, right. Wiggling your butt! That's not true. Got a lover? You do. You gave yourself away. Stop it! Scared Franck will hear? My sister says I have a lover! How crazy. I don't care. You blushed. Beet red. I thought the prodigal son was a child prodigy. There was a man, a rich landowner, - - who had two sons. One day, the younger son asks for his part of the inheritance. To leave home, live his life, travel. The father gives him his share. And the younger son leaves. Far away. To another country. But there, very quickly, he spends all his money- - in a life of disarray. Meaning? - Whores - Rachel, please! Okay, so... - he has no money- - and an enormous famine strikes the entire country. He's forced to work. He gets a job raising pigs. And all of a sudden- - he realizes the pigs eat better than him. He remembers that at his father's house, during a famine, - - the workers always had bread to eat. So he decides to go back home. The father's reaction is amazing. He calls his servants. He says to them: "Find me the nicest clothes- - and dress my son. Bring the fattened calf. Kill it We'll eat it." And an enormous feast begins. That's all? No, because in the meantime- - the older brother in the fields- - comes back from work. He approaches the farm. He hears music, singing. He asks what's going on. The servant answers, "Your brother's here- - and your father slaughtered the fat cow to celebrate." He's furious. He says to his father: "I've always obeyed you, - - I've worked hard for you all my life- - and you never gave me a goat! And for my brother, - "- who spent all your money, you kill the fattened calf." The father looks at him and answers: "My son, - - We've always lived together. But today we must rejoice and celebrate. Your brother who was dead- - is now alive. He was lost- "- and now is found." What a load of crap! What makes him prodigal? He squandered the fortune, spent all the money. That's not very positive, not very generous of him. So prodigals are irresponsible, not generous. That's not the issue. The idea behind the parable is- - the most beautiful thing in life- - is when someone who has sinned repents. Total bullshit. That way, by having a lover, you go to heaven. Only if she repents. Who's Rachel's lover? Do we know him? Enjoy it. Once it's all spent, you come back home. We're not opening a store. Why not? It's the banks. We could but it's better to wait So you'll stay put? For the time being Who gave her this, me or you? Me. It's an amulet. Why not join us next weekend? I can't. I have a barbecue. Your bag. Rachel? The country? I don't think so. You won't have to mow the lawn. You can walk in the woods with Margot. I'm really swamped. I have my book to finish. A great house in the country and no one uses it. Not next weekend, but the one after. Look at me. Look at me! Look at me, I said. She's asleep. What did you read? "Trouble in the Harem." Really? Good going. Do you explain every expression to her? Explain "We got bearded." It means we got tricked. You never heard that? I couldn't find your black sweater. It's in the hamper. Want some caramel ice cream? Any left? A little. Slap me. What? Give me a little slap. A slap? No, I'm fine. Forget it, just do it normally. Nice, isn't it? We can put the office there. Group classes here. It'll look great with wood floors. I was struck by Teri's beauty in the picture- - and the love with which Franck took it. I stopped wondering what he found in her, - - but rather what he could still find in me. Even though Vincent said he was in the same situation, - - in love with both. I didn't care. For the first time, I found Franck like other men. We were all going to be haunted by a simple question. Can you love two people at the same time? And especially, - - can you let it happen? What's going on? Is something wrong? Is there anything wrong? No more sleepovers. No more sleepovers. We're not a couple. Neither are you, or Vincent and I. So no more sleepovers. Okay, Rachel. No problem We can have sex, but we need new rules. The thing is we never really had any. I know. You had to say this now? It was urgent? I'll make tea. Let's wear our own clothes. We don't need to share our clothes, even if it feels nice. And I don't want to see- - Frank stroking your feet like that night. I understand. Sorry I woke you. Don't worry about it Let's head back home. I want to drink Teri's tea first. Take the key from my pocket. Put the heat on. It's cold. Rachel's coming. Want a smoke? We try our best. Margot, help Tim with his bag. Go with Margot I left movie money on the kitchen table. I'll make the bed. You'll sleep in the big bed Put your bag down. So here's our room. Hang your clothes. I left you hangers. Push it over, settle in. Comics, books. I have something for you. In here are old clothes, dresses, purses. See if you like anything. You can even take stuff home. But it stinks. Look at their faces! I hope Mathilde won't bring her biker friend over. Dream on. I don't know why I said that. I hope she has him over. If I were her, I'd call my biker immediately. Will it get nice? It's just a shower. Here we have gooseberries. What are they in English? Blueberries are "myrtilles." You mean red currants. Want some? I don't like berries. We have two pear trees, an apple tree. And I love this little fig tree. It tries its best. A peach tree. Almost ripe. Maybe we can eat them. A plum tree. Greengage plums. And those things? I can't remember. A walnut tree, isn't it? Nectarine. Sure? Small and firm. Like balls. Even I knew that. This one's great! Hear something? Open it. What is this? What are you scared of? - What's scary? - Nothing. - What is it? - You'll see. Won't be able to sleep. This is too much. I've always dreamed of having... - erotic adventures. Lots of them. But this is different. You two are. You drank too much, smoked too much. You ate too many gummy bears. Don't get romantic with me. You're right. I smoked too much. I don't feel well. You're better than me. You bend. I'm stiff. You smile. I frown. You're candid. I hide things. Light. I weigh tons. I'm wildly jealous. They're sleeping. Leave them. I got an ace. I'll pay. We'll see. Two clubs. The color... Another ace. That sucks. If there was a Tsunami and you grabbed onto a branch, - who would you save first? Me or Thelma? How's your report? Look at this. The wave wrecks the hotel. Show me. And who abandons her child? In the water, she only had one hand free. She had to choose one child. She took the young one and hoped the other would swim See? Listen up, Thelma. You too, Tim. Your mother is strong Stronger than others. What was I ranked as a teen? Second. Exactly. Second in Europe. I'd do this. I'd take Thelma like this. And I'd say: "Hold on, Thelma!" And I'd grab you like this and hold you tight. And I'd still have one or two free hands- - to tickle you with! That's mine. What is it? None of your business. And why not? Because it's my diary. I'm sorry. Who gave you the diary? No use looking all scared. Rachel. Tim, go to your room. Whose is it? Rachel's? You stole her diary when you stayed there? What for? Did you read it? Answer me! What did you read in her diary? Nothing. I don't care anyway' Lights off? In a minute. I know- - that position lets you think of Rachel before sleeping. What's going on? Does Franck have to use that oil? The sheets smell like coconuts. I'm sick of waking up oily. We have a machine. You do it on purpose? Fine. We'll call it off so you have clean sheets. Perfect. Fine with me. Why not? Rachel's right when she says it can't last. When did she say that? We talk only about them. It's all we do. I need some head space. Leave them alone. I can stop if I want. Don't do that. Please. Sometimes I think- - being alive is being with Vincent. Because the emotions are strong. Because I can't admit to my dreams. My hands clammy, my eyes wide open. My smile enormous, - because he makes me quiver. You do have a nice smile. Aiming for the sky? I thought I had a great shot. I don't know. Who is it? My dad. I don't know what he wants. The butcher closes soon. Who's going where? With you. Sure? Not with Mom and Franck? Shopping's no fun. And you? Us too. Don't you want to listen to your messages? It's a drag. Give me that. - What do I dial? - 888. You want to come to my country house someday? Would you like to go to the country? Today? Not today. A weekend, sometime soon. Yes, Treri? When did it happen? You're going now? We'll take care of everything. Don't worry. Can you have Franck call me? What is it? Franck's mother. She fell in the bathroom. I'll come and let you in. It's broken again. - Is Aubriaud here? - Not yet. Teri, a friend. No, you don't know her. Why did you let her climb on the tub? Come of fit! It was a bad leak. I left you three messages. She's asleep. Isn't that bad, after a fall? Mom? Sir. It's me. Franck. How do you feel? My knee hurts, Doctor I'm not a doctor. It's me. It's Franck. Aubriaud said a fall can erase short-term memory. I'm not a short-term memory! Don't be stupid. You fell while repairing the shower leak. Remember? I'm thirsty. She's thirsty. You know, I wasn't confused before. You've called Franck here before. Maby. I think I caught a cold. You okay? Want some tea? I don't have much time. Have you imagined life if you'd met Vincent first, - - or if I'd met Franck first? Be honest. Have you? I don't know. No. I have. So? So Thelma and Tim wouldn't exist, - and Margot wouldn't either. Thelma didn't know how to give it back. Don't be upset with her. Did you tell Franck? I wanted you to know I read it. Franck, I need to talk. Come. Come now. What is it? I first saw Vincent at the studio. Diane was supposed to see him about the Web site. He came late. She couldn't stay. He came back for the corrections- - but I knew he was there for me. He didn't need to come. We had a drink, in a bar nearby. He asked if he could kiss me. I said yes. We met again two days later. I took him to a hotel. We slept together. It only happened once. Why? Why what? Why did it only happen once? I broke it off. You'd had enough? In fact I didn't want to lie to you. I wrote you a letter to apologize. I don't want to see them. Did you call them? Coffee too? Sure. Don't look at me or I'll never manage. Vincent, look outside! Since no one dares to say it, - I'll say what we all want but can find the courage to say. It's totally over now. Moving furniture won't stop the guilt. I don't want a rug stained with Teri's blood! You can't leave us. You'll have to explain yourself someday. Fine. I slept with Vincent before we slept together. We did it 101 times, not 100. It's no big deal. It's a very big deal. Let's keep the magic Too late. Spare me. I know you meet Teri in private. Now it gets nasty. Were you serious about wanting us to meet? I guess so. Not at all. - What? - Didn't you know? Vincent said they'd break it off, unless you and I fell in love. - It was a joke! - Or a hunch. Cut the crap! Teri, look at me. Vincent was just kidding. You can throw your bowl at me for having done it, - - but it doesn't concern us. When Diane couldn't come to dinner, - - because her friend was sick, was that scripted? Not at all. Let's not sully everything because it's over. I don't know. Is it over? You decide to start and stop Cool. Keep on calling the shots. Rachel wants to! She wants one thing: - Not to have to explain. I want to stop. Why? I'm drained for the first time ever. You just have a cold You don't understand. Usually I'm never tired. I want to forget you. We go home and stop seeing each other. Come, Vincent. Vincent please. I can't do this alone. Vincent please. Stop looking at him! It lasted long enough. You'll spend all of next year's vacation without us? That night I called Rachel. What will we do? I was crying before I even spoke. Rachel cried as well. I don't know if I can manage. I said I couldn't get used to not seeing them, - - both of them. Can't I just call you? Can't I call you sometimes? Can't I write? I said to her, - - "When we're with you, we're better." She said the idea of not seeing us terrified her too. It made her want to die. I'm capable of not being excessive. No one saw anyone again. Franck and I started seeing other friends, - - like before. One day, Romain, who liked silly games, - - asked what we each found most beautiful. Everyone answered, - - For Noémie, her daughter's first smile. Diane, a tiara in the Louvre. Nora, a Hieronymus Bosch painting. While the others answered, - - Franck and I exchanged glances. Then Franck answered quickly: - the bay of Hong Kong. I said Margot's birth. I was sure he was lying. So was I. Margot's birth came in second. My father died suddenly a few weeks later. As I organized the funeral, - - I felt a sort of joy. I hoped Teri and Vincent would come. They didn't. The day of the funeral, - - I felt nostalgic, invaded by memories. But not childhood memories. I was overtaken by a more recent nostalgia, - - which would never leave me. For those feelings of dizziness- - and invincibility- - which I knew during that time with Franck, - - Vincent- - and Teri. Don't run on the stairs.
