Attention, workers are reminded that smoking is only permitted in designated... I can't even tell you what a joy it's going to be taking these down. Long time coming too, that's all I got to say. It's nice to be working with somebody who's got the cojones to step up here and clean the. I'm going to like working with you, I can already tell. Garth Lampson, the guy before you... that guy... I tell you, the whole time he was here, I didn't see him go below level 4 one time. Not one time. That old fart was just, you know, coasting out to retirement. There's something to be said for that. Well, maybe. I used to call him Gold Watch Garth, that's what I... Niles! Yeah? Watch their hands. Go directly to the med center. And to make sure that the doctor on call takes photographs. I'm pressing charges this time. Go! What took you? Had a little brawl at the Brass Monkey. Kristof boys again? Yes. All right, we'll take it from here. Bianca! Murdock? We're down here to party. You into water sports? Yeah? No. Now let the girl go. Marshal, you gonna shoot me? I hadn't thought about it, but that's a really good idea. Hey, Vlad! The big bad marshal says he's going to shoot me. Attention personnel... for tomorrow no later... See ya! Than 3:00 PM today for tomorrow's transport. Murdock, you know better than to come down here. You're one stupid son of a ,, you know that? Yeah, I know. Now tell your brother to let go of the girl. Sam. What's the deal? OK, OK, OK. Don't do it! Don't do it. Personnel are reminded to limit their person-to-person calls to one hour a week. Overages will be garnished from weekly wages starting this week. Thank you for choosing Transglobal. It's better you pull that trigger, friend. Cause no matter where they send me, I will come back here and I'll kill you. Cuff. Now I can't believe I got to beg my own partner come have one last cold beer with me. Gotta pack. All work and no play makes Will a very, very dull boy. Niles, what's up? I forgot my e-card in my room. You want to hold the car for me? Let's catch the next one, Niles. Relax, I'll be right back. Come on, come on. Surprise! For he's a jolly good fellow. For he's a jolly good fellow. For he's a jolly good fellow, which nobody can deny. Quiet, quiet! Quiet! Quiet! I think we all know why we're here, which is to get really drunk really fast. But before we get to that, I think we have to listen to this turkey for a little bit, so... Thank you, Niles. Now I think we all really know why we're here today. And that's to wish a fond farewell to the best marshal this plant's ever had. Will, we've had our differences in the past. Like when you decided to prohibit hard alcohol on the blue level, I thought we'd have a mutiny. But here we are four years later, production's up over 17%. Sick leave's down to nothing. And serious substance abuse... Doc, what'd you tell me about that? We haven't had a single detoxing in seven months. Look at that, Will. You're putting the shrink out of business. But seriously, this was always a good place to work, but it wasn't necessarily a good place to live. But thanks to Will... Who said that? And Niles, there's not a single sector in this plant from stem to stern from top to bottom where a man or a woman can't walk free from fear, free from violence. Will, you made this a decent place, where decent people can live and thrive. So on behalf of every person trapped on this bucket, Thank you, Will Murdock. We're going to miss you. Thank you, Will Murdock. Bah. I could not help him. Well, even if you could, it sounds like he might have taken you with him. I don't understand. Artie is the most dependable man on my crew. Boring, even. He had three children. Did he have any marital problems? No, he loves his wife very much. Well, maybe this one was different. Maybe it really was an accident. It was not an accident. I was less than 10 meters away. He was staring at something, hallucinating, maybe. Artie? Then he... It was bad. Emil, was Artie doing any drugs? Only his Zyloban. The same as everyone. Attention personnel. Smoking is only permitted in designated. Kopek's bunk? Thank you for choosing Transglobal. This Kopek's bunk right here? Will, I didn't hear you. That's because I was silently observing you to see if you displayed any abnormal behavior. So what did you find? Well, you're extremely neat, bordering on anal-retentive. I'd say you hate your mother. I'd keep your day job. I need your help, Doc. Of course. I found this inside Artie Kopek's medicine cabinet. Zyloban. All the level 1 workers take it, you know that. Are there any side effects to that stuff? Of course. Dry mouth, indigestion, sometimes mild sexual dysfunction. I mean serious side effects. Come now, you're grasping at straws here. No, no, no, Doc, just answer the question, please. Very well. Zyloban, Zyloban, a synthetic isotope blocker developed for the United States Army during the Pakistan War that protects human zone, radioactive materials... The effectiveness declines after... Side effects include dry mouth, indigestion... Mild sexual dysfunction. So the pills, they're harmless. I have been monitoring maranium diggers for over three years. In that long time, I haven't ever logged a significant side effect, much less the type of profound psychosis you suggest. Well, what about this? What about it? That's one of Emil Angeloff's pills. It's not scored. So? So all the Zyloban taken by the last three suicide victims were scored. Now I haven't checked the others, but I think I might find the same thing. So maybe this isn't Zyloban. Maybe it's a bad batch. It's very common. One out of every four workers experience some mild stomach upset. If they complain, I issue the scored pills so they can split them, take half at breakfast, half at dinner. Maybe... Maybe you have trouble dealing with the possibility that a perfectly sane rational human being can suddenly crack for no apparent reason. Maybe this has more to do with you than the victims. That's a cheap shot, Doc. Is it? When's the last time you had an episode? Come on, Craig, this has nothing to do with my claustrophobia. Answer the question, Marshal. I had a little problem in one of the EM cars just before the party. It was bad? No, I just took a few deep breaths, started chewing my gum. And I finally just opened the door. And what if the door hadn't opened? Fear is a killer, Will. I have seen it 1,000 times. It's like falling through fog. You don't know when you are going to hit the ground. But you know the longer you fall, the worse it will be. So you reach a point where you just want it to end by any means necessary. We've had nine suicides in the last month, Doc. Yeah, these things happen in clusters. I have some articles you can take and read if you don't believe me. I know. So I want to get those pills analyzed. OK, if it makes you feel better, fine. I'll take it myself. I can do it. No, no, no, it's fine. An old college buddy works for the FDA. I'll take a few samples with me when I go on the transport tomorrow, have him do it. Are you sure? It's no problem... No, no, it's no problem at all. There is one favor I'd like to ask, though. Yeah? It's kind of silly, but in my line of work, stuff like claustrophobia can really come back to bite so it's not too much of a problem, I'd really appreciate it if you could bury my file. What file? Thanks, Doc. What? Nothing. I'm just not in the mood, that's all. You know, this is all about you and me. It's payback. What are you talking about? What am I talking about? I'm talking about Will. He's jealous about us, that's why he didn't recommend me for the promotion. God, not this again. I got a solid work record, excellent job reviews. I mean, what else could it be? Maybe he thinks you are not ready. Not ready? What the hell is that supposed to mean? Nothing. Maybe... just he had other reasons. He had other reasons, all right. Like the fact that he never got over you after you dumped him. That's the other reason. You dumped him, right? I think it's better you leave now. Look, why don't I come by tonight after the orientation session? No, I don't think so. That's the way it's going to be? No, Niles, that's the way it is. Are you all right? Yes. Call Owen Porter. Tell him I need a change. He'll understand. Hey, Jess. Look out. No! Attention, the chapel will be closed today between 3 and 6 for pressure equalization. Thank you for choosing Transglobal. What's up, Marty? Jesus, Will, I paged you over an hour ago. What part of the word urgent don't you understand? It was half an hour ago, my friend. And every single time you page me, you say it's urgent. You remember Vladimir Kristof? Vlad? Yeah, I was just thinking about him. Well, he's headed your way. He's on a new transport. Yeah, that's funny, Marty, real funny. No, I'm serious. He was released last night from Terminal Island, some kind of evidentiary thing. We're still waiting for details from the DOJ. What makes you think he's coming here? One of our boys uploaded this to me this morning. Picked it up off some surveillance cameras down at the dock yard. Yeah, well that's Vlad all right. Yeah, it gets better. They all shipped out on the new transport. How'd they clear security? Beats the hell out of me. We contacted Transglobal and their home office is investigating it. All we can figure is they must have shipped out under assumed names. Maybe you can pick them up on your end. For what? As far as I know, there's no law against an employment application with an assumed name. And even if there was, it's not my jurisdiction, my friend. Sorry, Will. Technically, though, you're not on duty, so maybe you can ship out on a supply drone or something before he gets there. Take off? Run? Come on, Mary, I can't do that. I had a feeling you'd say that. All I can tell you is Chris Struthers will be down there Wednesday as scheduled. He's a good man. In the meantime, keep a low profile and watch your back. Out. Hey, Mike! All the good seats are vacant. You hear the news? What news? Kristof is shipping in on the noon transport. Vlad Kristof? Starkweather and Weed too. They're all coming. That should be amusing. Very amusing. Does Murdock know? Of course. Everybody knows. You'd think with Kristof back, maybe we have some fun for a change. To fun. Here, here. Beautiful! Look, I want those crates locked and ready to load by 11:30 or I'll dock his final paycheck. Yeah. Yeah, I can do that, and I will too if he doesn't get it together. OK, you have a nice day too. Every six months, it's the same old people cycling out, they figure they can coast... Owen I need to talk to you. Well, sure you do. Everybody... Vlad Kristof and his boys are coming in on the noon transport. That's impossible. They're coming in on that sub. There's an ore barge out of here in 10 minutes. Now company policy prohibits passengers. But in this case... Owen, Owen, this is my job. Look, that's. You've been reassigned pending relievement. Listen, if there's trouble, you're going to wish that I was here. Look, Will, if you're not here, there won't be any trouble. So I take off, those guys come down here, I'm gone, and everything's going to be hunky-dory? Is that what you're saying? What I'm saying is you're half the problem. The only reason Kristof would come back down here is for payback. Now I like you, Will. I'm not going to let you commit suicide. Suicide? Owen, I took those guys down by myself last time, OK? I can do it again. And this time I have help. I'm pulling... You don't get it. It doesn't matter who kills who. A lot of people are going to get caught in the crossfire. Now I'm not doing this just for you, Will. I'm doing it for the men too. Check it out. Hey, Lars, what's up with the hardware? I don't know. Something. Something wonderful! The most beautiful thing. Here, I'll show you. No! Hey, Skip, got you a co-pilot. Hey, Marshal, welcome to the Love Boat. Owen I don't feel right about this. Listen, listen, if it felt right, it wouldn't be you. Now get in that chair. But seriously, Owen, this is stupid. Happy trails, Marshal. Don't forget to write. Disengage. Sure is nice to have some company for a change, even though it's a cop. Yeah. Some of the stevedores had a pool going, big bucks on you staying put and mixing it up with Vlad. You turning tail, you won me a load of money, brother. I'm real happy for you. Holy! Turn around. Turn around, we're going back. I can't just turn around. Turn around and go back. I'm a federal law enforcement officer, and this is not a request. Yes sir. God! So how many guys went in there? We don't know yet. We're still trying to track everybody down. Yeah, process of elimination, It's the only way. There's nothing left to identify. What the hell happened here, Owen? What are you doing back here, Will? Owen said you... What's the matter, you afraid you going to lose money in the pool? What pool? What is he talking about? I got it. What is this, another one? It looks that way. Yeah, one of the diggers. What's his name? Lars Nilsson. He shoots in here with his drill and didn't say a word, just punched through the hull. Boom! Explosive decompression. So what happened to him? Water. It came through the iris just before it shut. Six tons per square inch hit him. Sealed up tight, though. Soon as the saline hit the sensors... Bang, tight as a nun. Saved the whole sector, just like she was designed to. Yeah, well, something tells me this guy ain't so thrilled about it. Hey, Will, what was that crack back there about a pool? A betting pool. Will I stay, will I go, who's going to catch a bullet, how many? I heard the action's pretty good. No, seriously, I was thinking about putting a big bet on myself. That way if I die, no one can collect jack.. Will, it's not funny. No, it's not. I've never been very good at jokes, Niles. What'd you call me? The joke motel. That's right, joke motel, Sergeant Will Murdock. The jokes... they check in, they don't check out. Will, it's not funny. And I got to talk to you. Fine, talk. It's important. Talk. Come on. All right. About this whole Kristof deal. What Kristof deal? This is serious. All right. OK. All right. The way I see it, we've got a pretty good chance of taking these guys. Now there's two of us and three of them, but you and me, we're trained marshals. These guys are just, you know, scumbags. As far as I know, Weed and Starkweather have never dropped the hammer on anyone before. As far as you know. Right. Right, as far as I know. The problem is Vlad. He's fast. And I know you don't want to hear this, but by yourself, he's got a pretty good chance of taking you. I don't know, I'd give him even odds, maybe. Please, better than even, trust me. But with me on your side, with the two of us together, he can't take us. I don't know, Niles, he made a pretty good go of it last time. I know that, Will. All right, believe me, I know it much too well. But ever since then... ever since then, I've been working every day on the sim program we got from the Justice Department. Niles, it's a sim program. Just hear me out, would you? Would you just hear me out? All right? I've worked my way up to level 5, all right? That's... that's top level, OK, master marksman. I got... I got a 92% accuracy rate, and my speed's in the top sixth percentile. The FBI has been qualifying their agents on this thing at Quantico for the past two years OK? So between that and the hours I've logged on the job... Rousting drunks and drinking coffee? You're not listening to what I'm saying. All right, Niles, OK. The last go round, I blew it. I choked. Hell is going to freeze over before I let it happen again, OK? It's been eating at me ever since that day. I'm not going to let you down, partner, not again. OK. I believe you. I do, thank you. It's settled, then. I'm going to back you up. You just gotta remember to back me up. What do you mean? What do you mean what do I mean? You know, when this whole thing's done, I will have paid my dues, right? You know, you can throw in a good word for me upstairs. With who? The guys upstairs, you know, Chief Watson? All right, I get it. So you scratch my back, I scratch yours, right? Exactly. OK. OK, let's just get a couple of things straight then real quick. Number one, I didn't have anything to do with you not getting that promotion. Word is Struthers is a good man. He's got three years seniority on you, and... And he was in line for the job. Number two, I... I hate underhanded bull... Hey... My turn, OK? I hate underhanded bull little maneuvers by people who think that they can gold brick their way into a job that they don't deserve in exchange for some half backup. And number three, pixels are not flesh, and sims are not bone. And a computer does not scream for a priest as its choking on its own blood. So you can take your offer and you can shove it right up your top sixth percentile. Am I clear? You're an idiot. You think so? The whole thing stinks. Get this, somebody posted $400,000 to bail out Vlad. Who? That's the thing, we don't know. It's written on a cashier's check from some bank in Barbados, some dummy corporation. What did Transglobal have to say about him jumping security? Nothing, nada. We keep asking, and they're not giving any information. Cover you all the way up the line. My guess is they're sweating litigation. What do you mean? Technically, you're not on duty anymore, which makes you a civilian. Anything happens to you, they're liable and they've got deep pockets. Hey, this could be your lucky day. Catch a stray and get to be a millionaire. Why doesn't that make me feel better, Marty? In any case, I pulled four of my best guys off tactical. They'll be there to back you up at 3:30 PM. Can you hold the fort till then? I guess I'm going to have to. Don't do anything stupid. Watch your back. Things will work themselves out, you'll be OK, Will. Thanks, Mom. Hey, Evan, what's going on? I hear you're looking for volunteers. I can use all the help I can get. That will be no problem. You have many friends here. Well, all right. Badge, access card. Is that all? That's it. I was hoping you would swear me in. OK. OK, raise your right hand. Say I swear. I swear. Dominus ominus, OK? Now you're sworn in. OK. I got a job for you right now if you're ready for it. You ready? Yeah. Excellent. OK, this is a list of all the recent suicides we've had in the last few months. Go to their quarters and see if you can find their Zyloban. And don't bother with the ones I've already checked off. You think the pills made them crazy? I got a hunch. So now I am a detective? That's right, you're a detective. Hey, Evan? Yeah? How's Bin? Not so good. You know she's leaving? No, I didn't know that. You shouldn't have come back. It's not like I wanted to. Yeah. Everybody does what they want in the end, even if they don't know it. Didn't come down here for a session, Doc. Of course not. You just told me yesterday that you don't want me to analyze this mess, and now suddenly, for no particular reason, you do. It makes sense to me. Come now, Will, talk to me. It's nothing. Just been having those nightmares again. Jessica and the kids? Yeah. I'm in... in the car. In the car? That's new. Can she see you? No, no, and neither can the kids. And we're driving along, and I see the other car, the drunk. And Jess turned back to check the baby, and the car swerves, and I see the headlights, and I reach for the... For the wheel. And my hand just passes right through it, like I'm a... A ghost? Yeah. What do you think it means? I don't know. Bzzt! Wrong answer, try again. I wasn't there. If I was there, maybe I could have done something about it. Bzzt, bzzt, bzzt, bzzt, bzzt. Too easy, too pat. Try again. Give me a break, I don't know. We've no time for games, my friend. Well, I was... You were what? Nothing. You were what? When I got the call, I was with Bin. With Bin? What does this mean? I mean I was with Bin. I see. Obviously, there is some type of sexual component to your guilt. It could very well be the root of your problem. The claustrophobia? It's unfortunate we don't have more time. Doc, in light of my current circumstances, I don't even like the way that sounds. No, no no, it wasn't what I meant. I know. Take a look. This graph here represents the elemental components of Zyloban. And this one represents the sample you just gave me. They're the same. Yeah, identical, no variation whatsoever. I'm sorry about that. Well, don't worry about it, Doc. It's not the first time I've had a lead go belly-up. I'm terribly sorry about this situation. It's not your fault. No, no. No, of course, but I just wanted to help you. I got plenty of help on the way. Don't worry about it. Thanks, Doc. Attention. Workers are reminded that smoking is only permitted in designated structures. Your help in keeping the air free and clear is really appreciated. Thank you for choosing Transglobal. So how's the action on Murdock? 22 to 1 on. Put me down for 10 when it gets dirty. You're putting good money on Murdock? Are you crazy? You're right. Gee, sorry about that. You're sorry? Just because you have a badge does not mean you can come into my place and attack my customers. Really? Yeah. Well, I guess you all know who's coming in on the noon transport. And you all know what kind of a man Vlad Kristof is. There will be trouble I've got a few marshals coming in this afternoon. But in the meantime, I'm looking for some volunteers to help me out. Does anybody want to give me a hand? What are you doing asking for help in here? Are you an idiot? Everybody here... they are friends of Vlad Kristof. You think they'll help kill him? That's not what I'm trying to do. The way I see it, the way we see it, it's you or Kristof. The smart money's on Kristof. All right. Emil? Marshal. How you doing? Leave that man alone. There is no one here to help you. If anybody changes their mind, you know where to find me. That went well. Son of a. Hey, Will, how you holding up? I think I figured out who posted Kristof's bail. Check this out. He's looking straight at it. It's not payback, Marty. It's a setup. I don't follow. Think about it. The appeal, the bail money, Kristof making that transport. Where... where did he get his clearance? Where did he get an access card? Hell, how did he get to Guam in the first place? This whole thing was engineered. By who? Everything points to Transglobal, which explains why you're getting the run-around from security. Will, you're going from A to K to Z here. No, no, no, no, think about it. It's the only way this whole thing makes sense, OK? They know about me and Kristof. That's why they picked him for the hit. They want this to look personal. OK, let's say you're right. Why does Transglobal want you dead? I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. Will, you got to cool down. The transport's set to dock in less than a half an hour. When it does, you've got to be focused. Yeah, you're right. Under no circumstances are you to engage. They got you out-manned and seriously outgunned. It's going to kind of tough, Marty, you know? They're going to be looking for me, and it's kind of a small place. I know that. But the only way we're going to be able to sort this out is if you're alive. Otherwise, we got nothing. Yeah, you're right. I'm going to say this one more time. Your job at this point is to stay alive. Well, I'll do my best, buddy. You do that. Out. Yeah. Murdock. It's me. Hey, Bin, how you doing? Don't sound so pissed. I'm sorry, I'm just I'm dealing with a lot of stuff right now. What's up? I need you down here now. What's wrong? Bin? Come in. Speak with your section supervisor for more details. Thank you for choosing Transglobal. Sit down. Drink? No. Well, I'm going to have one. I heard about Kristof. Who hasn't? You must leave. Bin, I can't do that. No, you can and you will. No, I won't. Why? You need to prove you're a big man? There's three of them, Will. Yeah, I know. I'm putting together some volunteers. Evan told me. A few frightened diggers with some badges and big talk. And I've got four federal marshals on their way in this afternoon, Bin. I'm going to be fine. This isn't working out as I planned. Things rarely do. I've never told you how sorry I was about Jess and the kids. Bin, you... you don't have to. I know. Even if I could, I would have never tried to take you away from them. No? Maybe. What do you mean, you couldn't find a single pill? I checked medicine cabinets, closets, lockers, even their pockets. Nothing. All their personal effects are supposed to still be there. Yes, everything except the pills. Except the Zyloban? Yeah. Attention, the chapel will be closed today... All right, Evan, now this is extremely important. When you were down there, did you see anyone, anyone at all who didn't belong there? No. You're positive? Absolutely. All right, thanks. Marshal? Dr. Petrov says good luck. Petrov? I saw him on my way to the dorms. In red sector? Yes. Thanks, Evan. You're welcome. Is he in? Yes. He's with a patient right now. Hey! Hey, you cant just walk in here! You out! Will? I'm sorry, Doctor, but I couldn't stop him. Quite all right, Vanessa. See you what you can do about rescheduling Mr. Dunlop, yeah. OK. Will, I know you're under tremendous stress, but... Where are the pills? What pills? The Zyloban that you lifted from red sector. You never go down to red sector, Doc. I'm afraid I don't know what you're talking about. OK. Good god, no! No time for kid gloves, right, Doc? Last night, I checked the uplink logs after we had our little conversation about the Zyloban. You sent a message to corporate. What did it say? I send a lot of messages to the home office. This one was encrypted, just like every other one you sent every single time a digger blew a fuse. I always encrypt my messages to protect patient's confidentiality. Bzzt. Too easy, too pat, try again. Stop it! OK, the truth. I was conducting some research. What kind of research? Maranium resistance. As you know, it concentrates in the tissues. So the diggers can only take six months. Bzzt. You're telling me stuff I already know, Doc. I know that you know. But the thing that you don't know is the single most expensive overhead item in this operation is the mass personal transport. So if we can increase the diggers' resistance up to 18, 12, or even 9 months, this would increase the... The company's profits by... by... By billions. So what is in the pills? I've told you. You know. Zyloban. I'm not lying to you, Will. Believe me, but it was just... A larger dose. A mega dose. Four times the clinical prescription. Craig? We were expecting some incidents of psychosis. Lee documented this in their FDA report. But what we didn't know was the rate of incidents, and the weight will result undesirable outcomes. Doc. You and all your friends in corporate are gonna fry when I get out of here. And I will get out of here. If it makes you feel better, I sincerely hope so. Attention, all personnel report to transit bay 6. The afternoon transport is here. Thank you for choosing Transglobal. Hey, Evan. What took you? Had to go see my shrink. So where are the others? There are no others. We're it. I couldn't get anybody else to volunteer. What? There are no others. You're kidding, right? Nope. You're it, Cisco, you and me. What about Niles? Niles quit this morning. You ready? But I... I thought there would be many others. Now give me the gun. I'm sorry, Evan. I'd be better off without you. I couldn't live with myself if I got you killed. Thanks, though. Don't worry about it. I'm sorry. All right. Good luck, Marshal. Thanks. Attention, personnel wishing to no later than... Game time. Thank you for choosing Transglobal. Hello, Doctor. What do you want? The Zyloban report, supporting documents, research, crap, whatever. Corporate wants it all. This is everything. Good. Thanks. Murdock's expecting you. He's not going to make it easy. No, that's real depressing. But when life gives you lemons, you must make lemonade. I feel much better now. You? Very therapeutic. I got him. Hey, Boyd. Hey, Marshal. What are you doing down here? You are are not expecting any trouble? I mean down here. What is that? Water? Yeah, heavy water. It stabilizes the maranium. What if it wasn't there? The water? No. Believe me, you do not want to know. Yeah, I do. It... I mean, the maranium... It's an extremely stable element as far as a radioactive material goes. It will remain in there for an hour so without water. And then what happens? Some sort of a meltdown? No, nothing like that. This stuff chain reacts. Like a nuke? No, nothing as big as a modern technical weapon. No, much smaller, more along the lines of say, Hiroshima. Hiroshima? OK. Can it be stopped? Yes, of course. Simply flush the unit and refill it, life goes on. OK. Flush the unit. What? Pardon me? Flush the unit. Now. Come on. Attention, all personnel. Please proceed to your designated evacuation pods. Attention, all personnel. Please proceed to your designated evacuation pods. Thank you for choosing Transglobal. Warning, critical temperature overload in. What's going on down there? Hey, Owen! Will? Is that you? What are you doing? Buying myself a little insurance policy. Temperature overload. What are you talking about? I'm purging the ore containment unit. The whole place could blow! If I die, they die. You were right, Owen, there's going to be trouble. And the best way to avoid anybody getting hurt is to make sure everybody gets out of here.
