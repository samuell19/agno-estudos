The Monkeys' Castle In the beginning... ...the monkeys lived freely and happily on the grasslands of the savannah. Their only concern was to bask in the sun... ...or in the shade of a bush, according to their mood. But this peaceful existence would be turned upside down by a terrible cataclysm. Under a black sky crossed by lightning, from far away, an enormous wave swept across the savannah. Panic-stricken by the threat of being engulfed by the water, the monkeys rushed into the forest close by. Many were drowned before reaching the trees... But some of them... ...managed to grasp the lowest branches... ...then up the huge trunks... ...to the very top of the forest... ...called "The Canopy". Now, that time has passed... into oblivion... In other words... ...a long time has passed. Come on son, don't stop now! Go on, be brave... jump! Go go, you can do it! 1, 2, 3. Missed! Still think you can do it, Grandpa? Maybe you will some day. Cheeky little rascal! It's incredible that you can't stop being a devil. Well, where's the harm in it? If you two have finished, Master Korkona gives his lesson today. So instead of this stupid bickering, you'd do better to go listen to him. All right Mum, we'll go. Are you serious? The last time, Kom didn't stop poking fun at him. Yeah, I couldn't help it... Korkona's a silly old fart. But I'll try and behave this time. Come on! Be careful! They can't do without each other. See who's first to the top! Watch out! Hold the vine for me! Thank you, Ma'am! Ssh! Yah yah yah! You utter the cry of the grand oath of the Wunkos... Everything at the top is good... And everything down below is bad! So why would anyone risk falling into that dreadful world? Be aware, that those who took such a risk, never came back. However... ...we always have a choice... ...because there are two sides to everything in the universe. Look at those blue flowers over there. They're in 2 parts. The lower part, that drops in autumn, is a potent poison. Yes, bad! So what? Don't interrupt! The upper part of the flower, that stays, is an antidote to the poison. Yeah! The world is like those blue flowers... Good up high, bad down low. Above all, young Wunkos... Stay on your branches! Hey, Master Korkona, just one little question... A question? There will be no questions! How do you know that everything is bad down there... ...when you say nobody has ever come back? Shut up, Kom! There will be no questions! Well I'm quite sure I can look after myself. One of these days I'll go down there. He's really crazy! That's how I am. It's logical... Everything that goes up in the air... ...wants to come down again. Even cherries know that. Will you never shut up?! Korkona wants us to be lily-livered like squirrels. Why? I can't see why I can't go down.. And some things are better. The branches are thicker, and you can dance on them. Dance? I guarantee you'd be dancing to a strange tune. Let me tell you, in case you don't know, what awaits you down there. There, it is a world of darkness... ...where everything is only terror, suffering, and sorrow. Everything down there is bad. Everything up here is good. That's what I bend over backwards to tell you. Get that into your thick skull! Now go home, and stick to the branches! You know Margad, the stories of that one-eyed old man don't scare me. Don't call him that... He can't help he's lost an eye. Yeah, but he CAN help it if he's a liar. I bet he invents everything that he goes on about. Well, you just stop with all that! Come on, we're going to get soaked. As he only has one eye, it makes sense he can only see half. Whatever. I'll say no more. Like his story of the blue flowers. What a laugh! Say Margad... look down below. See that light? Careful how you go... It's slippery. Wait here... I'll go down a bit further. No, don't be stupid! Kom... come back! Don't do that! NO! Your Majesty, it's getting darker and darker. We should go back. You're right, Ludovic, but our friend the tiger is not very far. Let's go on a bit further. - Your Majesty! - No, he's mine! Giddyup! After the tiger! Ah, he's a gallant tiger! Well done, my friend! He almost killed us this time. He's truly an opponent worthy of me. He deserves a better chance. Tonight, we'll go back to the castle. Hear them up there? They're the Wunkos... They say there are thousands up in the branches It seems they're all naked and sick, and full of vermin. I reckon that one of these days, they'll come down to invade us. If the Wunkos are naked and sick, they can't be very dangerous. Your majesty, come here, look! Here's one that won't hurt us. Be careful, stay there, you never know with them. Nothing to fear... He's dead I tell you. He moved, be careful! He can still bite. Kill him! No...! Don't kill him. But majesty it's a Wunko, one of those beasts that fell from up there. He must be killed, Your Majesty. We'll take him back to the castle, alive. I want him treated and entrusted to Master Flavus. As you wish, Your Majesty. You heard... pick him up gently. The king's gone mad! In any case, there's no way I'll touch him. Why? Are you afraid of catching a sickness? Well, it won't be a problem for me, I hope. That land over there... on the other side... We can see it clearly this evening. Sometimes it disappears entirely, like a mirage. One day, I'll take you to that country, Ludovic. That's the dream of all Lankos since the dawn of time. Yes, since the land in between was drowned in the terrible flood. Maybe it's just an impossible dream. But what would life be without dreams? What's the matter? Get along! Your Highness, the sunset is beautiful. Would you like to walk in the garden? She won't answer. The princess is out of our world. It's useless to stay here. Look...! Look, she's trying to talk to us. Just attend to your chores, Gina, you're just a servant. I'm taking care of the princess. Go outside! Housekeeper, tell me what happened. She tried to talk to the servant, Sire. If that happens, we'll have no end of trouble. Make sure it never does happen. That's right... put more in. Here, dear princess... For a daughter of a king, I find you very obedient. Master Flavus! What is it, Gina? Princess Sida tried to talk to me. But that ugly witch of a housekeeper threw me out, I'm sure if I took care of her... Gina, you know quite well the poor child is very sick. The king's doctors can do nothing for her. How could you help her? By discovering what's in the broth that the housekeeper is giving her. I don't trust that old witch. Gina, you're a good girl... But don't think I'm going to go looking for conspiracies everywhere. Why not? YOU might find one. Is this the savage who fell out of the trees? Don't they hide their ears? Never? Really?! Apparently no, no more than the rest of their body. He's weird. Can I touch him? Of course Gina. You're not going to believe what's said about these creatures. He looks normal. He has the same body as us. Exactly, the same hands, the same nose, the same ears. I think we have the same ancestors, and that won't please everyone. We've worked on it for months now, and still don't know what it is. And during that time, what's the castle become? If you ask me... an asylum for wild beasts. The king is too tender-hearted. And the princess has gone soft in the head. Careful what you say. Remember, the trees have ears. And the Gorilla, the spy of the Grand Chancellor. They often snoop around here. The Grand Chancellor... I don't like him much. But without him, the castle would really go to pieces. So, did you find out what it was? No, not even the workers know. But I did learn something else. The king brought back a Wunko, a savage of the forest. Maybe you could allow me to quietly kill him. You stupid imbecile! I know very well you have no information for me. How did you ever deserve that medal? You're the stupidest monkey in the castle. Look again. I want to know what the king is having built, with this latest eccentricity. And if you want to amuse yourself with that wild beast... Oh, thank you Sire, oh what a joy! I have never been able to separate his majesty from his dreams. They are futile no doubt. But one of them... maybe this strange object... ...may gain him the people's confidence. And that would ruin all my hopes! A demon... Help! You finally woke up? Like a bowl of soup? Is that a demon? Who's giving me food? Come on, little savage, and have your soup. But come here... Why are you running away? I promise the soup is nice. Don't be scared. I won't hurt you. Oh no, my goodness, what are you doing up there? You don't understand what I'm saying. Me... friend. You... hungry. Eat... soup. She's really very pretty. No, it must be a trick of the demons. Yum! Yum! it's delicious. Alright, as you wish. If you're going to be stupid, I'll just leave it. Do you understand that what I'm telling you means well? She's really the most beautiful girl, and I behave like a wild beast. They're not demons! If only Margad could see this! My son... now my only son... You know our customs. Those who fall must not stay in our memories. You must forget Kom and live your life. What if he's stopped from climbing back up, because he's a prisoner of demons? Margad, your brother is a prisoner of death. And let the example of Kom be a lesson. He thought himself smarter than anyone else. And I guarantee that demons are torturing him... ...and he's full of regret. We certainly can't deny... ...that Kom has great adaptability. It would be nice if he could adapt to say something like "thank you". Thank you, Gina. So why haven't you said anything before? I didn't know if you were good monkeys or not. So what reassured you? Just an impression. Emotive rather than logical. Intuitive and non-indicative. Oh, I wouldn't say that. Why is that? Because I've no idea what it means. He is not devoid of a certain sense of humour. We shall now proceed to his education. And what is that? A lot of nonsense you must learn... ...so as not to displease the lords and ladies of the castle. It's important if you want to be presented to his majesty the king. What's a king? He saved you when you fell into the jungle. Yes... teach me all that as quick as you can. With patience, you'll learn the sciences... mathematical calculation and geography... life, philosophy, etiquette, and the latest in ancient mechanics. Assimilate... Assimilate to be civilised. Assimilate... Assimilate to be civilised. Learn morality and to conduct yourself in society... and blow your nose like a princess and step like a royal, dancing gaily in the salons... to the music of the violins. Do what you're told, and you'll know it all.... and be assimilated... assimilated to be civilised. There, I'll learn as well... What I want to know about life... where I'm going... where I'm from... who I am. Of course, my boy, everything is here on the life of mosquitoes in the wetlands. Modesty and the laws of Homeric dress... Never show anything of your anatomy! Assimilate... Assimilate to be civilised. Yes, but our anatomy pales before astronomy... When the sun drowns in the sea to end the day... It's not he who goes away, but you who turns around. Learn Latin and Greek and you'll find everything you want in this library. Assimilate... Assimilate to be civilised. Assimilate... Assimilate to be civilised. Here is the library where we are right now. The servants live down below with the cooks, kitchen boys and guards. The upper floors are reserved for senior monkeys... musicians, courtiers, architects, advisors etc.. You don't have the right to go up there. The king lives at the very top of the tower. How is it known if you're a superior monkey? It's according to the height of your living quarters. Then we Wunkos are very superior, since we live at the top of the trees. Well said, Kom! Of course the stars you see are not as big as our world. Maybe they just seem smaller because they're a long way away. I never thought of that. Is that your drinking-water tank? Oh, no, Kom... it's cursed. We shouldn't touch it, let alone drink it. We can't even swim there? Well, it's forbidden to learn to swim. Some say it's a divine punishment of the gods... Others say that a huge monster hides beneath the surface... ...and if he wakes up he'll swallow the whole castle. That sounds like our Korkona. Don't tell me that you swallow everything you're told, too?! What's that over there? We call it a labyrinth. It's a sort of a game, where you start there... and you have to come out there. OK... I get it. Watch! At last the little savage has escaped his minder! I'll hide in the labyrinth and catch him! No, you're doing it the wrong way! Look at the trouble you're giving the gardeners... You're ruining their work. You have to find the way out by going between the hedges. Even if we don't have to? This is called sport. The pleasure is in managing to find your way out. See? What? For no reason? Yes, the reason is to prove to yourself that you don't need a reason. I find that ridiculous. But it's easy to do. Master Flavius, ​​I managed to do something useless... Am I civilized now? Help! Gardeners! Get me out of here! What's happening? You idiot, you scared me! Watch out I'm a tiger and I'm very hungry. Stop it, Kom, you'll ruin your clothes. Look at all these apples... they're ripe. Can they be picked? You can't climb. Teach me. That's fine, Gina, keep going. Give me your hand... that's it! Nearly there! That's it! I managed to climb a tree. Next time I'll jump from one branch to another. I hope nobody saw us. Why? Because I'm a Lankom and we mustn't behave like primitive monkeys. Well, what does that make me? You're not a primitive. You're a savage. My little savage. Damn it, I'm going to tear his hair out, one hair at a time. I'll cut his ears into slices and make him swallow them with chilli. I'm going to have fun with this little savage. Oh, it's only me! My little gorilla, let's go there without making any noise. Double, double toil and trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble. Into the cauldron goes the poison. Sire...! I've no time to listen to your nonsense. A strange thing made to walk in the water. What are you prattling about? Look what I found in Master Flavius's rooms. What? Impossible! The water in the lake is untouchable. Not even the king would dare. Though I guess he might be capable of it. Oh my god, a traitor's life is a very difficult one. Oh yes, oh yes! Good lord! A savage! What a stench! - It's shameful! - Oh my god, what a scandal! Your Majesty, honourable courtiers of the castle... Before presenting young Kom to this noble assembly... ...we did our best to give this very young specimen a little education. You could have taught him to cover his ears...! It is an outrage to so appear before His Majesty! Sorry! Please forgive me. I wasn't aware that ears were such a big deal with you. Do you know why you hide them? Are you ashamed of them? Come here, Kom! Excuse us Your Majesty... his education isn't quite finished. I confess he still has difficulties with hair and dress... But nevertheless, Your Majesty... Your Honourable Majesty... by conducting some empirical experiments... both naturalistic and prosaic... Why did you make that noise? Sorry but it's the cry of boredom, Your Honourable Majesty. I can see you're bored, listening to all those useless words. I'm bored, too! We Lankoms don't have such a cry. That doesn't surprise me at all. You talk too much... ...and don't scream enough. That's quite enough! Here is a very good example of frankness and spontaneity... ...which might be called "prima dialecta naturaliste". Tell me, do you have a cry for "silence"? Yes, Your Majesty. Why does your people use so many different cries? Up there we don't always have time for conversation. When there's danger you must act quickly... The cry is most practical. There's the cry of anger... Of fear... You can welcome the return of the sun... Or the return of your girlfriend. Or sun and girlfriend together. You hear...? Amazing... a real language without useless words. Give us some more examples. Tell me what that says. It's the cry of love. You seem to know it. Plenty of experience, eh? Now... everyone together... The cry of love! 1... 2... 3! Wonderful! Entertaining and instructive, at the same time. Don't you agree, Chancellor? What's faithfulness? Bravo Chancellor! You do that very well. Sire... she got away! My child... my darling...! Father... If she speaks to him... ...we'll be in a very unpleasant situation. Listen... Music! Music! Kom, come here quickly! The king wants to see you. He's right upstairs. Hurry. You asked to see me, Your Majesty? Tell me, little Wunko... I want you to amuse me, some more. You'll be my jester. A jester's job is to amuse his king. Never forget that I only need to snap my fingers... ...to send you back to the jungle... ...where our friend the tiger will make mouthful of you. For me, Kom. I can't forget her little face... ...as white and motionless as if it were dead. Make me laugh. I'm very sorry Your Majesty... You see, it's very difficult for me to make people laugh on demand. I'll give you anything you want... gold, rich clothes... you name it. I'd like to see my brother again, to tell him I'm alive. Very well... I'll take you to your country, Kom. - Look...! - What is it? A flying machine. Flying? Wow! Come on, be good, and don't be afraid. We'll do a test flight. It's not dangerous. Of course, but it's very exciting. Well, it works doesn't it? I promise you that next time we'll fly even higher. Better not to hear anything, say anything and especially not to see anything. Nice party, eh, Gina? So, the new king's jester finally condescends to speak to me. I haven't seen you for 3 days. I've no time. I must amuse him all day long. Look how bored he is without me. - You must be cautious, Kom. - Of what? Don't you see that the Lankoms all hate you? No Gina, I make them laugh. As long as I am with the king, nothing will happen to me. What if he gets tired of you? There's no danger of that... I've more than one trick up my sleeve. Come on, let's dance! Have you forgotten that I'm a maid? I'm not allowed to dance. Totally stupid! Lankoms have some strange laws. Tough luck, but I want to have fun. Go do your act, but without me! Here's my jester, at last. Time to change partners! Just pay attention to our business. What's going on? Your Majesty, there's a fire! What?! They must be crazy! Glasses of wine won't put it out. It needs water from the lake. Don't say that. For us the lake water is worse than the fire. If you're afraid of water use branches... Beat out the fire with them, like this. Your Majesty...! No, I don't want to see anyone. What's up? Aren't you my friend anymore? Can't you see I'm working!? Careful, I'll get you! Stop it! I don't want to play with you. Leave me alone... You upset me. But Gina, I don't understand anymore. You wanted me to stay a savage. I liked you better. I can't stand you being like those baboons of the court... ...with their ridiculous ways. You know what you are, Gina? Jealous. Me, jealous? Of whom? Of me. A simple little Wunko, fallen from his tree... ...who understands nothing of anything we try to tell him. Gina, come back! No Gina, don't go! I don't want to see you anymore. You can go back to your jungle. Gina! I don't want to see you again! But I love you, Gina. I love you. I had forgotten my village... and the forest where I was born... to leave the sky and the clouds... I'd learned all that was needed... to be a truly civilized man Am I from above, or am I from below... I don't know where or by whom I'm wanted Why do we have to stay in this castle? Deep in me I'll always be a Wunko... away from my brothers... a loner forever between the heavens and earth Am I from above, or am I from below... I don't know where or by whom I'm wanted Why do we have to stay in this castle? Deep in me I'll always be a Wunko... away from my brothers... a loner forever between the heavens and earth Margad! What are you doing here? Are you going to go up there to join your family? Well, it's not that... Not really. You're a free man, Kom. You're not a prisoner. But if you leave the castle, I will miss you. No... I changed my mind. I can stay a little bit longer I can stay a little bit longer. That's good. Where would I be, without my jester? Yes, I wonder. What are you doing out here? Couldn't you sleep? I'm having a miserable life. There's my daughter, who's sick... ...and has dreams that flare into nightmares. Then there's the jealousy-fuelled plots. You know my people are fearful and lazy. They need a noble cause to restore their dignity. Oh yes, I see there's something rotten in the kingdom of the Lankoms. I already read that somewhere. Basically, it's a castle problem. Why is there a need for a chamberlain, servants, courtiers, a chancellor, and then the king? Your castle is too complicated. Maybe you're right... But what do you know about castle politics? If the politics are meant to make everything work smoothly... ...we Wunkos know much more than you do. We don't do useless things like you do. It's completely crazy you can't take water to put out a fire... ...when you have a big lake at your disposal. You don't climb trees, you're proud of your very nice clothes. And you're ashamed of your ears. Your pal the tiger would make a better castle politician. Come on you'll end up catching cold. People of the Lankoms... Listen carefully! Disgusted by the miserable spectacle that Lankom gives them... ...in this period of decadence.... ...the gods send us this icy whiteness from the sky, in order to warn us. However, our irresponsible, morally bereft, dissolute king... ...instead of repenting, locks himself in the tower with his favourite. Death to the jester! Should we still accept this drunkard, this old libertine... ...might I say this eccentric... as your King?! No... no... no! So here is the solution. The three wise monkeys unanimously write the official text of his abdication. Hurray! Hurray! But who will govern and tell us what to do, and what is good and bad? Who else but... his daughter. Yes! His daughter?! Princess Hida, according to our ancient laws... ...must inherit the crown in the case of her father's incapacity. Of course as right now it turns out that she is a little unwell... ...and as I am the Grand Chancellor... ...I see myself obliged to assume charge of the kingdom in her place... ...for the time being, of course. Your Majesty...! Your Majesty...! Is that you, Kom? Come and see what's happening. Isn't it great? It must have fallen all night long. It's amazing. It's the first time I've ever seen it. What's it called? It happens from time to time at home. We call it snow. Lankoms have always dreamt of travelling and making rich conquests. Those who claim that I am crazy... ...and that the gods want to punish us, are again mistaken. Look... The lake was covered with a hard coating, so that we could cross it. Land we always dream of can now be reached. And I will lead you there. A new country... a new empire. The best of you will prepare yourselves to conquer a new world. I create plots and intrigues at court... I make sure that the king seems unfit to govern... ...and his daughter unable to succeed him. I spend years waiting for just the right moment. So finally, what happens...?! It's the right moment for the king, Sire... He's becoming the greatest hero in our history. What?! Not even an earthquake would topple him from his throne. Get out! Oh rage! Oh despair! That feels better! Take a look at yourself. Why? I thought I was just a dirty little Wunko, who understands nothing... ...who should go home to his jungle. Stop it, you know what I feel for you. If this were a musical, it'd be the cue for the love duet. "Oh my pretty Gina..." Stop that! What is it? Sire! Sire! The king is headed for disaster. He must be warned! Come and see... I'm sure I'm not mistaken. The ice, on which our unhappy army is crossing, will soon melt. What do you mean by "melt"? The ice, Sire... all the ice will turn into water. Just like that... beneath the king and the army. What can we do? You did well to warn me. But it's too late now... They'd have gone too far. It is indeed very sad, Master Flavius. Refreshing. For once I recognize that your fears can be useful. Sire... wait for me! Whatever you're doing, I want to be with you. No, I want to keep this moment for myself alone. Scram! Look after Ludovic! Help! Help! Do as I do. He's too far away to help. No, nothing can be done. No... nothing! Your Highness... Just leave it there, and go! To be king, to be king, to be king... I struggled but finally I am king I betrayed bribed I lied to you all, without respite But that's it, I'm born king... for the throne... For the throne we have to sacrifice all You can be a dog, a shark, an army of vipers Strike from behind to be king! Oh this word is the sweetest, it's the supreme happiness... The hottest thing, the cream of the cream, the top, the nirvana... is to be king! Tyrant... famous monster... You all are mere dwarves! I'll make Ivan the Terrible look like a wimp. I will be more cruel than the worst of assassins... I am king, I am king, I am king! Come back here, you little sticky-beak! You down there... Catch her! Stop her! Arrest her! I've got to do everything! Out of the way! Master Flavius, ​​help me! Serignol has gone crazy. Oh, I know, I know! I'll catch her! Come on, Ludo. We're nearly there... Hold on! Kom! It's you...! Where are the others? Gina... We're the only ones... I can scarcely believe it... The king and everyone else is dead. That's what I thought when I saw Serignol dancing with the crown on his head. We must protect the princess before it's too late. Both of you come with me. Look up there! The demon! Up there! Up there! That demon is the cause of all our misfortune. He alone survived the disaster, thanks to his evil wizardry. Now he taunts us. The jester must die! - They've taken control of the princess. - What do you mean? This is what they poison her with. It's not the soup I gave her. That's the poison from the petals that the housekeeper picked. What? I know where these flowers come from. What do you mean? Quick... hurry, they're coming. We must save her. Wait, I remember! The world is like these blue flowers... Up is good. Down is bad. That's it! I know how to find the remedy. You and Ludo look for the princess and make sure of her. Alright, but be quick. Catch him! There he is! Kom? Margad! That sounds like... Kom! It's really you! I knew you were alive. How about Mum... Is she OK? It's weird... At first she said you were dead... I don't know why, but all of a sudden this morning, she guessed you were back. But what's this thing? It's called clothing. I'll explain later. Aren't you coming home? No, Margad, I don't have time. You just tell Mum I'm alive and well. Will you come back some day? I know the way now. We do not need the princess anymore now. I put all the poison in this cup. The people will be unhappy. No doubt dear friend. But the people love big funerals. I'll break the sad news myself... ...after my coronation. Why does he still keep this stupid bird? For the last time Highness... Drink, my dear! That's a good girl... Drink it all up, Housekeeper! Every last drop! She is not in danger of dying. No, but it may sleep a long time. I'd be very surprised if a Prince Charming came to wake her up. I hope Kom found what he was looking for and will be back in time. Liar! Vulture! Traitor! It's the Devil! Guards, disembowel him once and for all! Kom is right about Serignole. You are a traitor. But your plot failed, thanks to Gina and her friend Kom. I proclaim that I am healed and ready to reign. Long live the Queen! 1.. 2... 3... No! Not the labyrinth! Now that I'm thinking properly again... ...I would like proper thinking to rule this castle. I was deprived of my will, but nothing escaped me.... ...and I thought about what we could do together. We must give up the idea of ​​a better world on the other side of the lake. The land of the monkeys is here on this shore. And that is the land we must make better... ...by banishing ignorance and superstition forever. We were afraid of the Wunkos... ...yet it is a brave Wunko to whom I owe my life. Wunkos and Lankom share the same ancestry. It is only time that has separated us. Now we must learn about, and get to know each other, for the sake of all monkeys. You uttered the cry for "sermon" and I repeat, that everything UP is good... ...and everything DOWN is bad. Look! Silence, you insolent brats! Where are you going? The lesson's not over! Come back immediately! You'll all be punished! Come back here! Look... Kom has come back... There he is! He's been successful!
