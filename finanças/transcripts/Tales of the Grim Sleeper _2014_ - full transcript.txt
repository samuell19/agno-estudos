[BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Lonnie Franklin lived on 81st Street in Western Avenue in South Central, Los Angeles, the poor part of town with the worst schools, the worst hospitals, and no jobs. Everyone knew Lonnie. He was a good neighbor. Someone to turn to for help, whether it was to buy a washing machine or TV, borrow some money, or buy you a meal. Lonnie lived in this street, fixed people'’s cars in front of his house, and always had time for a chat. Lonnie was so much a part of the community that when the Google car went past. Lonnie was found chatting to a neighbor as he always did by the front gate. [CHOPPER WHIRRING] Then on the July 7th, 2010, police raided Lonnie'’s house and arrested him. Lonnie Franklin is charged with ten counts of murder, and one case of attempted murder. His murders stretch from 1985 until his arrest in 2010. He'’s also a suspect in multiple other murders. It is thought Lonnie might have killed more than 100 women over a 25-year period. I wondered how this was possible. [CHILDREN LAUGHING] Hi.Hi. So, you saw him in the night before he was arrested? Yeah, I'’ve seen him the night before. We was talking, and he asked me what was I doin'’, and I told him I was gonna go clubbing. Well, I got in about 3:00, woke up about 7:00, and the whole street was blocked off. [SIRENS WAILING] Couldn'’t go nowhere, couldn'’t do nothing. Just... Street just closed off. I mean, he was a nice guy. Just never thought I'’d put anything past him like that. Don'’t make no sense. [CHILDREN CHATTERING] [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] This neighborhood of suburban houses with lawns and gardens is deceptive. Look closer, and there are bars on the windows. And the highest homicide rate in the city. Most visitors coming to LA will fly directly over Lonnie Franklin'’s house, which is just below the main LAX flight path. Lonnie Franklin grew up in this house. His parents lived here before him, and his son Christopher lives here now. Everyone on the street knew Lonnie. These women knew him for years. So you were dating Lonnie? Yeah. I dated him a couple of times, more than once. Oh, yeah?Yeah. What was he like to date? It was like... Well, more so, when I dated him, he was quiet, low-key, kinda acted funny though at certain times. Like what? How did he act funny? J... Jibbity. I mean...Jibbity? Looking around, acting like somebody looking for you. What you done there? Uh-huh.You know. Hey, come on, now. That made me nervous. I can'’t do that one. BROOMFIELD: Hi. I'’m Donna.Hi, Donna. Do I need to state my whole name? I had just came from a party and, uh, he pulled me over to the side...MAN: Peckerwood! And he was talking to me and then, uh...MAN: Goddamn peckerwood! [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Someone called me "Peckerwood" from across the street. I thought "peckerwood" was an endearing term, but later learned it'’s a white supremacist prison gang. Get your ass out of the goddamn country! Peckerwood. You goddamn peckerwood! Get your ass out of here! [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] The men in the street didn'’t like me talking to the women. It was three of Lonnie'’s best friends shouting. Steve, Gary, and Richard, who wanted to stick up for their buddy, who they think is innocent. Media'’s exact words when he was first arrested for this crime was, "They found the Grim Sleeper." MAN: Mm-hmm. He'’s been accused of it.That'’s what they want to believe. "We have found the Grim Sleeper." That'’s... Even if he has a jury trial, everybody is saying, "That'’s him." "He did it."MAN: But it might not be him. BROOMFIELD: So did you three all use to hang out together with Lonnie? Occasionally. At least once a week, we'’d be standing here all together. Because we'’re neighbors.All together. We'’d be one group. All together. At least once a week. I ran with Lonnie. I ran with Lonnie. We'’d cop in a car and we'’d go and do our thing. I ran with him too.Myself too. I ran with him too. Lonnie, he'’s a good guy. What do you want to know? And this is a close-knit block.This is a close block. Very lose-knit. Very close. Everybody in this block has been here for...Generations. Forty, 35 years up here.Generations. Yeah. Everybody just here now. Me, 46 years. Go ahead, man. If you come in this neighborhood, just like this, you know, Lonnie would be with us. If you come in this neighborhood, and then if a person wanted to try to start a dope house or something like that, it'’s not happening. He was shutted down.And he was right here with us. BROOMFIELD: So you didn'’t suspect anything. Never... Do you know what? When they picked him up down the street right there, do you know what I thought it was? For stealing cars.Bingo. That'’s what everybody thought it was. Because that was what he was known for. Stealing cars. That'’s what got him in the back, not because he was such a convict. He was such a good car thief, that'’s why the hell he'’s got all this stuff upon him now. My opinion of that is, I'’ve been knowing Lonnie and his business a long time, I'’ve never, never seen him steal a car. He didn'’t steal cars. Let me correct it there. He did not steal cars. He dealt in stolen cars, but he did not steal cars. I'’ve never seen him steal one neither. Okay, let me rephrase myself. He dealt with a shitload of goddamn cars. [LAUGHS] He dealt with a shitload of goddamn cars. It'’s hard for me to believe because Lonnie, the way that he would raise his kids, his grandkids. Man, he had his son, his son learned to drive at the age of nine years old. You know what I mean? Taught him how to drive well, how to do mechanics, how to ride a motorcycle, with his grandkids. And for a man to have a value of life like that, how can you just take lives and Lonnie had a conscience. And carry on a normal life like he did? A person that does a thing like that...Normal life... It'’s hard to believe it. It'’s hard to believe it. I'’ll go to my grave believing that he didn'’t. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Lonnie appeared quite relaxed, carrying a Nora Roberts romance. JUDGE: All right. This is the matter of the people versus Lonnie Franklin. Gentlemen, take your places, please, from yesterday. Pass it to the court. MAN: Yes, Your Honor. We'’re still engaging preparations... [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] The case is still in pre-trial phase. Lonnie is pleading not guilty to ten counts of murder, and one count of attempted murder. Ten other murder cases are pending. Photos of 180 missing women found at Lonnie'’s house have also been circulated. BROOMFIELD: And do you think there is a good chance of his innocence being proved? Again, as far as to examine all of the evidence to determine if he'’s culpable of a crime or not. Obviously, we are going to put on any reasonable defense we have to show that he'’s not responsible for these actions. And are you making progress in that? We'’re looking at everything. BROOMFIELD: Can I see her picture? This is Janecia. This is my baby girl. Right here. The love of my life. I don'’t think the pain of losing a child ever really goes away. It'’s like, it's just there. No matter what you do, how well you'’re doing, it'’s just there, sitting right there, like, Janecia'’s not here. So... And she has a son, and I'’ve got to deal with the son'’s pain. And I have to tell him sometimes like, I miss her every single day too. We both miss her, but we have to learn... We have to learn to... go on. And that'’s what we learned. That you have to put one foot in front of the other and get up and keep going. That'’s the only way we'’re gonna survive it. That'’s right. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] This is Margaret Prescod, founder of Black Coalition Fighting Back Serial Murders who are critical of the police handling of the case. Margaret Prescod first started leafleting the neighborhood in 1985, 25 years before Lonnie was arrested. He'’s been killing women all for now the past three years. I mean, just on the Memorial Day, they found her daughter in the Sixty-Eighth Street Elementary School, she was the 17th victim. REPORTER: All of the women were found strangled or stabbed, their bodies dumped. In January, a task force was formed to track down their slayer. A month later, this group, the Black Coalition Fighting Back Serial Murders was organized. Before the arrest was made of Lonnie Franklin, we were actually out in his neighborhood. We were leafleting around there. And the interesting thing about it is that it was shocking how many people who lived in the neighborhood knew nothing about any serial murderer. They just didn'’t know. How is this possible? There is very few communities outside of a black or brown community in the city of Los Angeles that that could have happened. Where you have that number of women. If you have these people killed, and people who live practically around the corner don'’t know anything about it, that'’s unconscionable. I'’m telling you, back in the 1980s, we had a count of 90 women. Only 18 of them were on the books. What happened to the rest of '’em? Are some of them in these photos? Or if they are not in these photos, where are they? I think many more women were killed, and the police admitted at the time, or the police are admitting today. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] The police have no idea how many women were murdered. It could be hundreds. Lonnie worked here for many years driving a garbage truck. Police say many victims could be buried in landfill. Did you ever know this guy called the "Grim Sleeper"? I didn'’t know him. You didn'’t know him? You guys are too late. The guys that knew him have probably gone home. BROOMFIELD: We'’re doing this film about this so-called "Grim Sleeper." Okay.Lonnie Franklin. Did you ever know him? No, but I heard that he used to work here. He used to work here.That'’s what I heard. Yeah. Said he used to work here, and I don'’t know where he went after that, but he was like a loader before they used to have the rear loaders. Right. And he was a loader and... [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Lonnie Franklin, if indeed he is the Grim Sleeper, was called that by journalists because it was originally thought there was a 14-year hiatus in the killings. Now it'’s thought he most likely carried on killing, but the bodies had never been found. PRESCOD: This was also the period that crack cocaine was running, you know, in South LA. Every time people talk to me about South LA, and they talk to me about the murders, I'’m always very, very concerned that the context has to be a community that has survived, has survived against all odds. [CROWD CHEERING] People who moved... Black people who moved from the south coming to California, a lot of them, you know, wound up in South LA. And that was the time that there was some industry, auto and other industry, so people were actually able to earn a living. I mean, they had some kind of income. That industry, you know, dried up at the same time the factories and the jobs fled from South LA. So you had a whole population of people newly... I mean, it was never an affluent community, but, where are you gonna get an income from? At the same time, there was an epidemic of crack cocaine coming in to South Los Angeles. [COUGHING] Because of the crack cocaine epidemic, because of the poverty levels, because the so-called riots had happened, that people felt, "Well, who cares about this community?" They don'’t have high-paid lobbyists, you know what I mean? There'’s nobody advocating on their behalf. So LAPD and the city officials felt that they could get away with it. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] In the '’80s, crack dealers employed more people in South Central than AT&T, IBM, and Xerox combined. After leaving sanitation, Lonnie worked as a mechanic in this police station. I called the leading detective to try and get the police side of the Grim Sleeper story. [PHONE RINGING] But the LAPD refused to comment. [WOMAN SINGING] ♪ I saw you baby ♪ Fell in love so fast [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Pam met Lonnie on the streets and agreed to show us his world. ♪ Anyone could tell Crack comes with whores and excitement and drama. It ain'’t just about getting high, it'’s excitement, it'’s how you're out here looking like Hobo motherfuckin'’ Kelly, and motherfuckers pick you up, and you know, you'’re feeling good, and twisting and turning, you know what I'’m saying? You think you'’re all that, and motherfucker, you know, oops, this is a serial killer. You know what I'’m saying? So you know what I mean? So, you don'’t... It's about the excitement, the chase. It'’s about the chase. The chase and the thrill. "I'’mma get this motherfucker," '’cause that's what I said. "Oh, this looks like a super good one." You know what I'’m sayin'? And the shenanigans began. [FUNK MUSIC PLAYING] Well, I usually get what'’s hoeing right around there, on West Street and 41st and 42nd, up and down that way by the Mustang, Snooty Fox and the Comfort Inn motel. He would pick me up around there. You know, he'’d be driving around in his van. The last time I felt something was wrong '’cause he was like, "Bitch, you know what?" And I said, "Bitch"? He was like, "You don'’t never want to do what I really want you to do." I said I'’m not a motherfucking dog. "Bitch, now, "You don'’t own me. I'’m not a motherfucking dog. "What the fuck? I'’m not going to bark." You know, and then he was like... When he said "I'’m gonna drop you off," I said,"You ain'’t gonna drop me off. "I'’mma leave right now. I can make it from here." [DOG BARKING] BROOMFIELD: Are you sure he'’s okay to pet? Jesus. Are you sure? Blow! Blow! Blow! Hey, you can'’t let him get up on you... This is my ex-husband. He left. We were together four years. He wanted to go separate ways. That'’s my son. That'’s my mama. She died in 2010. That'’s my granddaughter, and that'’s me, and that'’s my mom. And those are me. Where is your husband?He'’s at home. He lives in Long Beach. There you go. See him? There you go. Yeah. It'’s cold out here by myself. And it'’s all right. I live alone. You know, for a girl... Yeah.You live alone? Four years sober. I'’ve come to the light. Four years sober?Four years sober. And I have my own self. This is me. You know. I don'’t drink.What were you on before? Drugs. Crack. I used to smoke crack ever since I met Lonnie. That'’s how I know all these girls that you wanna know. I know these girls because I was out there hoeing. Let'’s go.Let'’s go. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Pam says she knows some of the 180 missing unidentified women. The pictures were released by the LAPD and found at Lonnie Franklin'’s home. Many of the women are homeless so we looked on the street. [Pam] She was a young girl. May she knows... Hey, can I ask you a question? I'’m just curious... I'’m doing a research about the Grim Sleeper. Do you know anything about the Grim Sleeper? I'’ve seen him actually driving around. I'’ve seen him actually talking to one girl. When though?This is like a while back. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] The victims ranged in age from 14 to 36. All had been shot with a .25 caliber pistol or strangled. Hi, did you know about the Grim Sleeper? Were you out here at home when the Grim Sleeper was out here? The what?When the Grim Sleeper... When the killer, the man was out here killing the women? Were you out here then? All right, you have a good day and be safe. Huh?You have a good day and be safe. All right. How old are you? You know me? Wasn'’t we at that train station together? What train station? I mean a bus station.What bus station? See, there are lots of bus stations down here.Yeah. How old are you?Twenty. Twenty? Have a good day. You know, because half of these bitches got pimps, you know what I'’m sayin'? I don'’t like pimps so, you know, I disrespect pimps. You know. I don'’t like pimps. I have no respect for any man who puts a woman out here and makes her sell her pussy. He ain'’t selling his dick out here with her. That'’s wrong. [LAUGHS] Yeah, put your skirt on and come out here and work with her. That'’s wrong. But you know, some people like it, some people with it. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Less than 50 percent of this community graduates from high school. This is not just a story about Lonnie, but about a people in one of the world'’s most prosperous cities who have been left behind. Pull up right there. BROOMFIELD: Your mom used to hang out with him? Mm-hmm. They used to drink and stuff. PAM: See?Smoke. [LAUGHS] BROOMFIELD: Did you smoke?Huh? Did you smoke? PAM: Crack.Oh, no. I don'’t smoke. My mom is a drug addict. So, yeah. But yeah, he used to hand out with my mom, stuff like that. They smoked, they used to drink together. I didn'’t know him in a negative way. BROOMFIELD: At his house?Mm-hmm. Right next door. 81st, Corner of Western. BROOMFIELD: 81st. Cool. Uh, I was about 19. PAM: How old are you now?I'’m 29. Twenty-nine? You look good. You don'’t look 29.Thank you. I have a baby too. Yeah.You don'’t look 29. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] I was surprised that we still hadn'’t heard any terrible stories about Lonnie. Everyone we met seemed to like him. I got a call from Gary, one of Lonnie'’s close friends who I had met on the stoop, saying he had something to tell me. How is it going?Everything'’s going good. They going good?Yeah. Come on. Thank you. All right. How'’s it going?All right. BROOMFIELD: So what did you want to tell me? Okay, like... Like I said, I always, first of all, you know, my head... you know, my heart, and I take my hat off to the victims, you know, the victims'’ families, you know, because it'’s truly a tragedy. Okay, now, as for Lonnie, I don'’t believe that Lonnie did it. But after the fact, there'’s a lot of things that I'’ve been thinking about, you know, and the media is kinda creating doubt within me. Like the .25 automatic that they say that he shot the surviving victims with, I would see him with a .25 automatic, standing in his front yard. He showed it to me. Where would he keep it? He would keep it in his top pocket.Where? Just... In his top pocket. Just like right here. BROOMFIELD: So you saw the .25.GARY: I saw it. He showed it to me. Okay, and... A lot of things, you know, has come up, where... I saw handcuffs fall out of Lonnie'’s car. I went talked to him, and then... I joked with him and I said, "Hey, man, what are you, the police or something?" You know, and he laughed it off, you know, but... It'’s like he was letting me see these things, a lot of things, you know. Like, maybe he wanted me... It was a $250,000 reward, and maybe he was feeling guilty or something, I don'’t know. That's where I'’m looking at it now. And maybe he wanted me to get the reward. I went in his house, he showed me pictures where he had... a picture of a girl that he took inside the house. I'’m like,"Lonnie, this is inside your house. "What are you..."What was she doing? He took naked pictures of her, you know. And I'’m like, "Whoa, where was your old lady?" And he just gave his laugh. [IMITATES LAUGHTER] You know, and all. Do you think Lonnie almost wanted to get caught? I mean, you know, that'’s the way that it, to me, if he did do it, Why would you show somebody something like this? $250,000 reward and all this. Man, you got the gun and that'’s, you know... the gun that'’s supposed to have been used. Man, you just showed me this. You blatantly showed me. Why do you think people didn'’t tell the police anything about Lonnie before? Who knew? What do you mean, tell the police? Who knew? Well, he was heavily into women and pornography... Oh, you'’re telling me, after he got caught?No. Before. So what he was into women? A lot of people are into women. What do you do? Go to the police and say, "Hey, this man into women"? No one have anything. Women coming up dead. We knew that. They arrested a police officer for the murders at one time. But a lot of people said Lonnie was weird. Lonnie... he was weird in his own way. He was weird. But he was Lonnie. If you know him, you'’d know him. He was weird. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Richard also asked to meet up. BROOMFIELD: There were some other things you wanted to tell me? Yes. I got permission from... How should I say? I got permission from Lonnie'’s... Mrs. Franklin, to tell you about an incident that occurred when I was with Lonnie. We were driving around... We were supposedly scouting for a car. We were driving down Figueroa, he sees this girl, he sort of flips. So we passed her like maybe ten to 15 feet. Passed her, he pulled over. He got out and ran back there where she was, they were having words, and all of a sudden, she tried to go away, and he grabbed her, put her arm behind and... grabbed a handful of hair and was pulling her to the car. And all the time, I'’m looking back, looking at this. What was she doing? She was hollering and saying,"Let me go! Let me go! "Help me! Let me go!" And I said, "Man, what the hell is you doing? Dude, what are you doing?" And he looked, I guess he caught his senses, he collected himself real quick, he let her go, and before he can... after he let her go, before he can just walk plainly to the car, the police came out of everywhere. Yeah. We were both arrested. They never charged me with nothing, they never told me why I was being arrested, they just arrested us. Did they take your prints or anything? That'’s the strange thing about it. They didn'’t even book us. They didn'’t even fingerprint us or nothing. They just put us in a cell. Just kept us there for hours. Wouldn'’t talk to us or anything. Then all of a sudden, the guy came and said, "You'’re free to go." But see, they had split Lonnie and I up. They took him out of the cell with me, and put him in another cell for like three hours prior to them releasing us. And they didn'’t charge him with anything? No. He left with us. His wife picked us up. And no fingerprints, no DNA? No fingerprints, no tests, no nothing. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Before Lonnie Franklin'’s arrest, many people in the community believed the police themselves were involved. A police officer, Ricky Ross was arrested for the murders, but released for lack of evidence. However, the suspicions still exists in the community. WOMAN: State your name and spell it out, please. My name is Lonnie Franklin. L-O-N-N-I-E, F-R-A-N-K-L-I-N. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Lonnie had 15 previous felony convictions, yet he never had his DNA taken. WOMAN: How many times have you been convicted of receiving stolen property, sir? Uh, probably around four, five times. How about GTA? Grand Theft Vehicle or Auto? Around five times. Five times. How about battery? Battery? Two. Two times. How about assault with force likely to produce great bodily injury? Have you also been convicted of that? Mm... It'’s a possibility, yes.How many times? Once. How about false imprisonment, sir? False imprisonment?Mm-hmm. Once. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Lonnie has now been in custody without bail for the last four years, but he has still not come to trial. [SOBBING] [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] This is Diana Ware, stepmother of Barbara Ware, ne of the Grim Sleeper'’s first victims. She'’s come to every court date since Lonnie Franklin'’s arrest four years ago. Yes, I have, and it'’s important because when Mr. Franklin comes in to the courtroom, he can see us. And when he looks in that audience, I want him to see me to know that every time he'’s there, I am there. Because the people that he murdered had family that loved them and supported them, and they want to see justice done. That'’s why I am there every time that he is in court. [SOLEMN MUSIC PLAYING] [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Barbara Ware, age 23, was murdered on January the 10th, 1987 with a .25 mm gunshot wound to the chest. Police knew, in 1987, from ballistics, that the same .25 mm pistol was used in two previous murders, and that they had a serial killer on their hands. But they didn'’t release this information to the public until August 2008, 22 years later. BROOMFIELD: Why didn'’t the police tell you it was a serial killer? I really don'’t know. I was really shocked. Uh, I was home when I heard the news and it came on TV, so I was really shocked to hear that. But...But I guess the police knew from 1988 that there was a serial killer. I really don'’t know anything about that. I didn'’t think it was that long, but, I don'’t know. I really don'’t know. And when was it that you found out? I found out in 2008. 2008.Yes. Yes. I found out... I heard it on television. So...But the police didn'’t contact you first? No. You know. [CALLER READING] [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] This 911 call reporting the murder, which many think is the voice of the killer, also wasn'’t released for 22 years. [CALLER READING] 911 OPERATOR: What'’s your name? [CALLER READING] CALLER: Okay, then, bye-bye. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Acknowledgment of the serial killer and the 911 call were only made public after the murder of Janecia Peters. I feel bad for all of the victims, but I still always feel like it didn'’t have to happen to Janecia. Why didn'’t they tell the community that there was someone running around, you know, killing girls, PRESCOD: Why didn'’t they release the 911 call when it happened? Somebody might have recognized the voice. Mm-hmm. The van that was being driven, they found the van. The church van. Messed that up. '’Cause we were outraged after because they knew that 11 or 12 women were already killed before they even announced anything. And when we went and said we were concerned about it, they said, "Well, why are you so concerned about it?" And we were a bit shocked. And they said, "He'’s only killing hookers." That was said to us by the captain or whoever it was down there. Would you believe that? The police don'’t care because these are black women. It wasn'’t like he killed no... It'’s not like Lonnie killed no high-pro white folk. You know, it wasn'’t... I mean, we don'’t mean nothing to them. We'’re black. What the fuck? Just another nigga dead. You know, you shouldn'’t have been out there on them drugs. This was... This case is not a high-profile case because they didn'’t make it one. Now if I was a fuckin'’ celebrity or a white woman, you know, maybe they would have did something. That would put more emphasis on it. You know what I'’m sayin'? But I'’m a black woman. Who gives a fuck about me? [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Pam is still contacting women on the street she knows. I like the way Pam refers to us as her friends from England to explain why she'’s riding around with a couple of white boys. Hey, Liz, come here! Liz, remember the Grim Sleeper? Did you ever get involved with the Grim Sleeper? Uh-uh.He never crossed your path down here? I'’m just doin' a research. You seen him? Can you just tell them what you saw? These are my friends from England and they are doing a research. Did you ever catch him here? You ever dated him? Uh-uh. No, I didn'’t. You never seen him? Uh-uh.Oh. But I passed him by, you know, in the neighborhood. How are you doin'’?I'’m okay. You'’re still looking good, girl. Thank you.You'’re all right. She'’s been out here for almost 40 years. That'’s a damn shame.Forty years? Forty years. Shit, I started out... When I was out here, I started young. I was 17. And I'’m 45. That bitch is older. She'’s older to me. She still looks good. Bitch ain'’t lost no teeth, all of '’em is her teeth. Were you out here when the Grim Sleeper was out here killing those girls? Were you out here then? No? How old are you? Nineteen? She ain'’t got no panties on. Look, you should get it. Nick, can you see? Nineteen. Be safe. All right. She ain'’t got no drawers on. You don'’t see her? Yeah.Damn. I guess she'’s nineteen. She'’s young.Nineteen. She'’s out here, ass out naked. That'’s fucked up. Let me see what she'’s doing. Back up, back up, back up. Can you back up?Back up. Oh, that'’s a street girl. She'’s trying to get a treat. I ain'’t fuckin' with y'’all. Watch out. Watch out.[CAR HORN HONKING] Okay, let'’s go around. We'’ll pick the bitch up and go and buy a bunch of beers. You gonna get the beers '’cause I might want the bitch. What'’s up? Where are the rest of the girls at tonight? Ain'’t no girls out here? You the only one out here? You are like the police. No, I ain'’t the police. I'’m an ex-hooker just like you. I just don'’t do it no more. Because I'’m doing a research about the Grim Sleeper. Don'’t trip. It ain'’t got nothing to do with you. If I was the police, you'’d be in jail. But that'’'s your thing. Said I'’m like the police. Bitch, if I was the police, bitch, I would have busted your ass and made you go put some clothes on. Okay, which way are we going now?Where you wanna go? Should we go back up?Yeah. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] I really admire Pam, who'’s almost running our production by now. Recently Pam was turned down for a job as a bus driver because of a felony conviction for possession. Now she also can'’t vote, get food stamps or public housing. Pam has managed to contact number 147 on the police composite of photos found in Lonnie'’s house. She lives on this housing estate but isn'’t a victim or missing person. [DOG BARKING] BROOMFIELD: Which one is it? Three? Is this flat three? Are you flat three? Hi. Sorry to bother you. We were looking for flat three. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] This is DelaShawn, whose picture was taken by Lonnie Franklin when she was dating Christopher Franklin, Lonnie'’s son, at high school. DELASHAWN: Well, this is Christopher John Franklin. BROOMFIELD: Which one? Oh, there? DELASHAWN: Oh, God, this is a creepy situation for me because I just think about it. I spent my entire eleventh grade summer in that house. I spent the night, we went on vacations. I was exposed to his wife, his sister, the rest of the family. We did funerals... I did a lot with that family. So...And how did they seem? Normal. Normal?Normal. Normal family. Typical family. Mother and father, work. Uh... Mr. Franklin didn'’t work, he was always at home. And if you ever needed anything, you'’d just tell him, and he'’d get it for you. Don'’t ask questions, just know that he got it for you. How he got it, we ever knew. What kind of stuff? If you wanted a TV, he'’d get it. If you needed a car, he'’d get it. If you needed a part for your car, he'’d get it. There was no question of how he got it, but he got it. I still can'’t process this person who killed these women being the person who would go above and beyond to help you. because this wasn'’t the character he came off. He would have a conversation with you, but during that conversation, something perverted would come out. That'’s just who he was. He'’s just a horny old man. That'’s exactly how everybody looked at him, as a horny old man. I can say there were... Now I'’m gonna get a little personal. There was a few times when we would be in the room, and you could tell he was listening at the door or at the door, like... When you were in the room with his son? Yeah. Like, sometimes he seemed like he was a pervert. Seriously. [CHOPPER WHIRRING] DELASHAWN: The lights are always off in that house. So it was always very damp in the hallways and in the back. They opened the kitchen window with the blinds, and the living room with the blinds, but the lights in the hallway, the lights in it and the bathroom lights were never on. It was always like, tea candles were burning in the bathroom. It was always magazines... Like, porn magazines in the bathroom. He kept porn magazines on the side of the toilet. And then at night he would leave. And I just remember, he had a Pinto. The backyard was junky, the garage was junky, the rooms were junky, the house was junky. It was just one of those places where there was always just stuff everywhere. I do remember him having a shoe box with pictures in the garage. And I remember him laughing with his buddies, passing the shoe box around. He always had three cell phones. I always asked him, "So why do you have three cell phones?" He told me. One was for business, one was his personal. And the third one was for his hoes or his crackheads. And did he show you pictures and stuff or... He never showed me pictures but we did borrow his... He had a white van, like a church van, we did ride on that once. And in the glove box, I remember once Chris asked me to get the screwdriver out the glove box, but when I opened the glove box, there was like a Polaroid picture, it'’s like the old... What are the ones that you snap? Yeah, Polaroids.And you fan '’em. But there was a stack in the glove box, and in there were like, lace panties, or something lace in the corner. And I just grabbed the screwdriver and closed the glove box. Yeah. Didn'’t think anything of it. So where are you guys headed? BROOMFIELD: We'’re filming these alleyways where the bodies were found. Shall I ride?Yeah, you wanna ride? BROOMFIELD: Can you see how all the bodies were very close to where he lived? Yeah. Western, Western, Gage, Western, in between... I see in between... Well, you got one on Vernon. 2500 West Vernon. That would be like on Crenshaw and Vernon. Right around his house. RICHARD: Yeah, 81st, Van Ness is the closest. Very close. That'’s five blocks. There'’s been a couple of bodies that were found in this alley since I'’ve been living here. I'’ve been living here since I was 12 years old. And you know, couple of things done happened through here, you know, gang-related shootings, uh, people getting dropped off in the alley, uh, things happened in that alley. Did you hear where the Grim Sleeper body was dropped off? It was right here by this. This post right here, it was a black bag.Which one? This post right here, it was a black bag. [GUNSHOTS] That'’s shooting right there.They'’re shooting. There'’s shooting right here. You hear it Nick? [GUNSHOT] RICHARD: Did you hear the shooting? I think we should go. [GUNSHOT] Well, let'’s just stay put for a moment. We don'’t wanna... [SIREN WAILING] Where did that guy go? We don'’t know who'’s shooting, man. That man ran. We don'’t know who'’s shooting, or why is everybody running. There a whole... A lot of bodies have been dropped in that alley. People have been shot in that alley, killed in that alley. So the Grim Sleeper is just one more. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Lonnie'’s obsession was taking photographs of all his encounters with women. At first on Polaroid, then graduating to video and cell phone. But he really... His specialty is flipping pictures. He likes taking pictures, all kinds of positions. You know what I'’m sayin'? Just, you know, naked, close your eyes... you know, all this... Like a wild animal. You know, taking pictures of just dumb shit. He liked snapping pictures. What kind? You know, You... Close my eyes, you know, bend over. You know, turn around, prop my ass up, just freaky shit, you know. That'’s it. That's the best what I can tell you about him. He'’s just a freaky motherfucker and I was just the lucky one that I had the instincts, when all bets were off, finally got away. BROOMFIELD: Okay, it'’s in that door. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Gary and Richard, both bachelors, seemed to be part of a kind of amateur photographic society with Lonnie Franklin and various others in the neighborhood. He would call and say, "Man, I know some freaks." You know what I'’m sayin'? '’Cause he knew that I knew some too, you know. And we just, we compared notes, you know what I'’m sayin'? I'’ve got my divorce. I was a single man, hurt, and all this, you know what I mean? You know, I turned into a bachelor. You know. That'’s what I'’ve been doing. You know, not proud of it, but, you know, I would... But I'’m not into killing and all that, you know. These are... Like I said, these are some pictures. This is what me and Lonnie would share, you know, with each other. I have some pictures, you know. I got a couple of them that Lonnie knew and others I sort of knew them too, and took out, you know. But this is what was going on, you know. Just like this one right here, and Lonnie, he... He knows her, and then just like I was saying, you see the alcohol right there. That'’s what she liked. So, you know, that'’s how Lonnie would get his women. All right.You know. You see... So this is when he was still taking pictures? Yeah. And this is the girl that came and talked to you and stuff like that. Definitely she was on hoe stroll. Okay, roughly, these, uh, just, uh... A girl that enjoys having sex and posing. She felt that the pictures are a form of art. BROOMFIELD: And would you sit around and show them to each other in the back of the garage in the shoe box? GARY: Yeah... You know. Yeah. He knows her. I didn'’t talk to Lonnie. Lonnie would sit up there just like this, '’cause that's what our conversation would be about. "Man, let me tell you something." Okay. Now this right here, we'’d be comparing it, just like this, he could never be dirty. He'’s like, "Bam!" [LAUGHS] Oh, my goodness. "Bam!" Lonnie got a white van and he had a camera in the back of it. RICHARD: Then he had the mobile home. He had it on a tripod, a tripod like that, and it was parked right in front of his house. There was a mattress on the floor. And that'’s where he would do his work. He'’d be right there, you never would see his face, but, say for instance, if this is between her legs, you'’ll never see him. You might see his fingers, He'’d be doin'...He'’d have his hands on the vagina, but you never would see his face. I didn'’t want to say anything last night, but a couple of times, I had to... You know I do carpets. Yeah.I had to... Lonnie paid me. He gave me money to clean the van. The mobile home. I always cleaned the carpet. I cleaned the carpet four to five times. but I never suspected it'’d be- I didn'’t know what dry... You know, what it looks like, but to e, it was like oil, but I got it oiled up, '’cause I have the special solution to get it out. But the police took the mobile home. Did they ever bring it back? He had a legal shop back there, so they took all... But I haven'’t seen the mobile home back. It could have been. I'’m not... It was easy to get off. And it was dark like oil. But it wasn'’t oil. That'’s hard to get off. BROOMFIELD: Hmm. Yeah, but... [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Lonnie was by far, the wealthiest man in his street. In this area of high unemployment, it'’s estimated that at least one-third of black males would receive felony convictions at some point, and lose the right to vote, get food stamps and public housing, and many jobs. Lonnie could pick and choose who he employed. Everyone wanted to work for Lonnie. This man burned cars for Lonnie. BROOMFIELD: So how did you know Lonnie? How did you know Lonnie? Oh, man, I did a couple of jobs for him. Oh, you did?Yes, I have. What kind of jobs?Uh, insurance. I was involved... Knew Lonnie. I did a couple of jobs for him, which I told you, were insurance jobs. This one was kind of strange. He said it was his, he wanted to have it burned. He said what? The car... Yes, set the car on fire. Did he bring you the car? I came over to where he was located, Where was that?81st. Outside his house?Exactly. Got the keys from him, drove the car off over here. Right.Over here. And, like I said, when I pulled up, I thought I was gonna find something of value. Searched through it, and discovered some female clothes which had some blood on it, and in the backseat, and on the floor. There was blood?Blood. A lot of it?Yes. Yes. Yeah. Considering, yeah. And you knew it was blood, was it?Well, of course. In detail. It was discolored, but still, you could tell it was blood. And you didn'’t think anything of the bloody... Didn'’t think anything of it. Never. When you find bloody clothes in a car, don'’t you think that'’s a little odd? Not really. I mean, it'’s just... hey, carried out what I set out to do, took care of that, went back. What did you set out to do? Set the car on fire. And so what did you do exactly? Uh, took out some... A lighter, paper, threw it, set it on fire. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Richard introduced us to Jerry. Jerry worked with Lonnie as a mechanic, and was his companion at night picking up women. Gentlemen, how are you doing today?BROOMFIELD: Howdy. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Jerry says he was with Lonnie with about half of the women on the police composite. I met Lonnie when he bought a bike from me. You know, bought a bike and all, I said I won'’t charge him. I was on crack cocaine. And I was... He bought the bike for ten dollars. And ever since then, me and Lonnie became good friends. He would see me walking on the street, he would pull over and say, "Man, I'’m looking for such and such. "You see such and such?" And I would say, "No." He said, "You wanna make some money?" I got a car I need to pick up. I said okay. You know, by me being on crack cocaine, I was anxious to do anything to get another hit. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] I discovered it was Jerry on the Google image, talking to Lonnie. On the left is the camper van where Lonnie allegedly filmed and killed women. BROOMFIELD: Just describe what it was like picking the women up. Well, majority of the women we knew and majority of the women, we'’d say how much for both of us. You know, and they'’d say,"Well, Sometimes they'’d say half and half, or they'’d want straight cash or they want straight crack. And then we'’d stop to get some liquor, whatever they wanted to drink, and we wouldn'’t have no problems with it. But some women get attitudes because the majority of them wanted dope to hit. He wouldn'’t give it to them '’cause they weren't performing, or he'’d get mad and put them out, asshole naked. But like I said, sometimes, he'’d pick them up, and he'’d drop me off, but he'’d keep the women with him. How come you dropped me off, you know? '’Cause... I would have to go home to my girl, or I had to do something. Do you think he killed those women? Well, it might have been. It could have been. It could have been the women he killed. You know, if he did it. NANA GYAMFI: You'’ve allowed black women to walk around here when someone is hunting them, not knowing that they'’re being hunted. Imagine if they would have treated victim number three as if she was a student over at UCLA, with blonde hair and blue eyes. How many other people might still be living? But the lack of concern allow for this hunting ground to just be free and open for this person, you know? And that is, for me, the real, real, real tragedy. You know, the real tragedy is just the lack of concern allowed so many more people to be murdered. BROOMFIELD: Do you think also that people were afraid to come forward and say something? That'’s very, very plausible. I mean, the relationship, its... the relationship with the police and the community is such that no one wants to be the person who'’s giving the police information. You just don'’t. I tell my own son, you know, he'’s 16 years old, "If something terrible happens and your mother'’s not home, "here are the numbers of people to call. "But whatever you do, do not call 911." No, literally, for what? So you gonna come answer the door and they can pull you away. Don'’t call 911. You know, while you'’re there, you'’re trying to tell them what happened to you, they'’re trying to find out, you know, do you use drugs every once in a while? Or you know, are you art of this gang? They'’re trying to fill out their little field identification card when you'’re trying to explain to them that someone has done something. You know? You cannot just, as a black person, walk into an LAPD station or a LASD station and just say, "I have something to report" and start describing something, and think that you'’re going to be, you know, be treated with dignity, treated with kindness, treated with concern, and be able to leave feeling good, you know, warm cockles of the heart that "Yes, I'’ve done something." It is a 99% chance that this is gonna be an unpleasant situation for you. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] I couldn'’t help wondering how much Lonnie Franklin'’s own family must have known about what was going on. His wife, son, and daughter, living in this house, which, as DelaShawn said, had junk everywhere. Sylvia Franklin, Lonnie'’s wife for 30 years, is well-respected in the community. She works in the school superintendent'’s office, and goes to the church at the end of the street every Sunday. Matter of fact, if we had came a little while earlier, like five minutes earlier, you would have seen her leave the church. Is that that church?It'’s the church. It'’s right here. Wait. Let me see. There she is right there. Look. Turn. Turn. There she is in the shawl with the cap on, the white hat. That'’s Lonnie's wife. That was Lonnie'’s wife? My goodness. Do you think we should go and say anything?BOTH: No. No. No?No. She would be awfully upset. But that was her. I always wondered, I look at his wife, and I'’d be looking at Lonnie, and remember the stuff Lonnie done show me, and I said, "Lonnie, how the hell does she put up with this?" How does she put up with this? She had to... Didn'’t know. But I couldn'’t see her being in the house with him and didn'’t find none of that stuff none of the time. She had to. You know? Like those... Well, then too, she never went in the garage. She never went back there. That was Lonnie'’s domain. The backyard was his domain. She come out the house, she'’s out the house, done. Man, it didn'’t seem like... "Are you guys really married?" You know? That'’s what we'’ve been... I'm like, "Wow." You know? '’Cause it's unreal. You never saw them together. You never saw them in the same car together. You never, never, not one time in my life I'’ve ever seen them together in the same car. Over twenty years, man? Come on. Never. Some people say they had separate bedrooms. I don'’t know. You know, I don'’t know that. But I'’ve been in the house and Lonnie don'’t let everybody in his house. Don'’t wanna believe it. Don'’t wanna believe it. Don'’t wanna believe it. Man. That would blow my mind. DELASHAWN: At the time, I didn'’t know that they were having marital problems. I didn'’t know she actually had her own place. But it made sense because she would not be there, and then there was times that she would be there. She lived in her house and he lived in his. I don'’t think they ever really lived together. Or they did at some point but then they weren'’t. Because how do you leave for days at a time and then you come back a day or two and then you leave for days at a time? So I'’m assuming, with her leaving for days at a time, is why he was out doing what he was doing. '’Cause no woman was there to tell him or stay on him, or there was no woman there for him. So he would go elsewhere. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Everyone said the closest person to Lonnie is his son Christopher. RICHARD: He was always home. He was little then. He'’s a little guy. But he was always home. Up until he moved out, but he was always home, he was involved in his dad'’s business, I'’m not saying he was involved in the murders, but he was always involved in his dad'’s business. I'’m not speculating on Chris, but, it'’s very hard for me to believe that if anything went on in that house, that Chris didn'’t know about. I really don'’t think he... He had to know about some... You know, even had a suspicion of something going on, that wasn'’t right. Chris is a type of person if he didn'’t like you, he would attack you, or, he would pull a gun on you. He would try to stab you, he would run over you. Whatever he could do to harm you, he would do, and he would not think twice about it. And as a teenager, I thought it was awesome. I had a boyfriend who'’s crazy. And then as I got older I realized he was really crazy. BROOMFIELD: Do you think he got a little of that from his father? I'’m sure he did. I'’m gonna say I'’m positive he did. I don'’t know. There is plenty of times when we would drive around, he would have his gun laying on his lap. We'’re out driving, going to get something to eat, and he would have his gun, a fully-loaded gun, laying on his lap. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Pam thought she might have the best chance of getting a meeting with Chris. BROOMFIELD: Should we go over there now? Do you think he'’d be there now? You want to go right through?We could try. All right, let'’s go. Mmm-mmm-mmm. I thought you were saying you were a little nervous because... I was, a little....you know, he'’s a scary... Hey, I'’m not scared of nothing but God. You know what I mean? You have to understand what I was saying. You get a little... You know what I'’m saying? I ride around with two white boys, I'’m from the hood, I'’m a crackhead, I don'’t know if y'’all from England, you motherfuckers could be anybody. And when did I become a motherfucking investigator? I don'’t give a fuck about Lonnie. You know what I'’m sayin'? See, '’cause I don't want nobody to shoot at your car, or do nothing to you, and you gotta be careful. I mean, you know how they are. They think you'’re the fucking FBI, riding around there. "Who is this?" Then they figure, "This bitch, who is this bitch? Who the fuck is this bitch?" Back up, back up, back up. There'’s nobody on here. Damn. Okay pull up. Go on some more. Go. There you go. There you go.Was that Chris? PAM: Let me see. Keep going. Keep going. Keep going. Uh-uh. That'’s Chris.Just call across to him. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Pam gave Chris her phone number to call. He said he'’d think about it. This is Lonnie'’s dog, famous after his arrest among neighborhood kids as the guardian of the haunted house. No one dares knock on Lonnie or Chris'’ front door. [HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGS ALONG INDISTINCTLY] Turn it down? [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Pam took us to find Christopher'’s childhood nanny Lili, who now lives homeless on the same streets that Lonnie used to ride at night. [HIP-HOP MUSIC CONTINUES] [SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING] Pam introduced us to Roxanne and showed her the pictures of Lili. PAM: Lili, you know Lili. You know who Lili is? No, she looks like my home girl, Portia though. You'’ haven't seen her, never on Figueroa? Yeah. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Roxanne also knew Lonnie. He paid me $40, I ain'’t gonna lie, for a blowjob. He wanted me to go to his house and go in his garage, but I didn'’t 'cause I don'’t go to people's house. And he got my friend Beamer, we call her Beamer, her real name was Brenda. He cut her across her throat. You know, she stayed on 68 and Menlo, but after that happened, Beamer had left outta here. You know, she got scared. BROOMFIELD: What did Beamer say he did? What was he like? He raped her, and then he cut her throat. Tied her up and raped her, and he cut her throat. And like, sometimes, when I would look at him, he would look kind of evil, you know... It didn'’t seem like he was trying to hurt me, but I was like, "I don'’t wanna go to your house," and he was like,"Baby, you'’re going to the house, and you'’ll go in the back, "and you'’ll kick it back there in the garage. I got a camper." And all this. And I was like, "No, I'’m cool. I'’m cool," but I was scared. So I went and did what I did, he let me go. And then when it happened to my home girl Beamer, I was like, "That'’s the same guy!" I promise to call. PAM: All right. Thank you so much. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Roxanne didn'’t find out anything about Lili, but she did put me in touch with Beamer'’s pimp, who said Beamer was too scared to talk. PAM: Hi, is Lili in there? Hi, is Lili in there? Lili? These motherfuckers, I know these motherfuckers over here '’cause I used to smoke with '’em. So we'’re gonna find her if she'’s out here. If she'’s out here. This is where I used to make money. I used to live right there. It'’s where I started out. It is what it was. Really crack... And that'’s another crack house. See them sitting out there? It'’s just like the devil's den though. You know, you gotta be... It'’s just... I almost lost my life over here, so... It'’s the devil's den. Got to be no sign to fuck around, so what? You know passed through here, but for as hanging, you couldn'’t pay if I... If I was to hit the pipe today, I wouldn'’t come over here. Hi, I'’m Dion! PAM: I need Lili.I live on Browning. PAM: All right, I need Lili. Can you go get one girl out there and fuckin'’ ask for where Lili is? Yeah. Give me five dollars. PAM: Here you go. I'’m so broke. PAM: Let me see. There'’s five dollars. I need it. I need it. Okay, I'’ll get her. I just need Lili.Which one? Sherry or somebody? PAM: Let e see Sherry.Okay, come on. BROOMFIELD: Where is the crack house? Right here. I'’m gonna show you. Which one?It'’s dead. See how dark it is? Nick, it'’s right here. This is the crack house.This is the crack house. Yeah.The dark one? Yeah, the dark one. You see? It'’s the devil's den. PAM: Hey, come here. [GLASS SHATTERING] I don'’t want that five dollars back, that'’s chump change to me.DION: I ain'’t worried about that. PAM: Okay. I need... There'’s nobody in there? Just my friend Ray-Ray, like I said. Ray-Ray, Ray-Ray. Who'’s Ray-Ray? Some young girl, 30...Oh, that silly nigga Ray-Ray? You can'’t go in the house or something? You done fucked up? Yeah.Oh, all right. Thank you. Here, give this cigarette to your mom. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] The irony is, Lonnie'’s house is just opposite the crash pad where Pam found Lili the following morning. PAM: You know, they want to know the truth. And talk so that they can understand you. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] I remembered what Pam had said about Lili. Everybody use and abuse her. Everybody use and abuse her. That'’s what she likes. To be used and abused. She'’s a sweet girl, but she'’s looking for love in all the wrong motherfucking places. BROOMFIELD: So you were the nanny... Yes....for Lonnie'’s son. Yes. What was that like? So he finally told me his dad do profound things to him, and he has ladies in the house, and he sits and watches dad through the peephole. You know, so, um... When Lonnie had come to pick me up, come pick... He picked up Chris, he would always ask me to come to the car and he had some things to show me. So I'’m like, "Okay." You know, and I would set Chris down and let him play the little Game Boy until, well it was Atari then, but played the little games until we came back. So I would go to the car, he would open up the trunk, and he would always tell me, "I want you to wear some panties "or some stockings with some heels on, "and I want you to..." you know, he'’d want to tie you up and put... BROOMFIELD: So he would do this to you while you were babysitting? Yeah. Yes. He would wanna take pictures of me, of poses, you know, of very, like, I would call it nasty. But by me doing the drugs with him... Well, he didn'’t do drugs, I did the drugs. Drugs?Yes. So, you know, as my addiction went on, I would do whatever it took. You know, and then... But he started getting like, aggressive with me. You know, like he would wanna choke me. You know, as he had me handcuffed, and I would be telling him, "Don'’t do that. I don'’t like that." You know, and he would always wanna have anal sex. He would put a doggie, what do you call it, leash? Like a collar.Yeah, around my neck, and would have sex with me like I was a dog. After a while, it got kinda sickening to me, and I couldn'’t babysit his son anymore because I couldn'’t take what Chris was going through, you know, and I wanted to report him but I didn'’t, you know, because of my addiction. So, that'’s my story. Unless you wanna know more. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] This is Fernando, one of Lonnie'’s close friends who said Lonnie would joke about killing crackheads and cleaning up the streets. But no one ever believed him. BROOMFIELD: Where do you think all the anger and hate came from? He said that his first wife did it. Made him hate women. His first wife. She'’s the one who did it. She hated... He hated women because of his first wife. It'’s what she did to him. I heard that she was a street crackhead. Straight crackhead. You come home, He gave her the money. He gave her the money and she'’d go spend it. She'’d go spend it on drugs. Won'’t pay no bills.Won'’t pay no bills. BROOMFIELD: So he had another wife. No, this was his first wife.His first wife. Lonnie'’s first wife. Wife he got now, she'’s cool.She'’s straight up. So what did the first wife do? You think she made him hate women? Yeah. I believe so.I believe so. Yeah, he really loved her. You know, in reality Lonnie is a good guy, man. He'’s a good guy. He really is.But it was something inside of him, the hatred that triggers him off. Yeah.That would trigger him. I'’d have to... I don'’t know how he did it... What did he say about his first wife? He hated her.He hated her. He hated her. If he'’d see a woman down the street who'’s a crackhead... [WHOOPS] Man."Come here. Come here." What did he say about crackheads? He hated them.He hated them. He even hated men that was on crack.Yeah. He... He wouldn'’t...He didn'’t like drugs and drinking at all. He wouldn'’t... You know. He'’d look at you like you'’re dirty. Yeah. He would look down on you. Look down on you.If you drink or smoke... He'’d look down on you.He'’d look down on you. He'’d like nobody who drink, smoke, nothing. Nothing.He wouldn'’t have answered to you. So why would he give them crack? He gave them crack to get them in the car. That'’s his thing to get them in the car. You see, you got... I'’mma tell you something, man. You got women walk up and down Western 24/7, midnight. Western, Florence, Figueroa, looking for crack, or money or a treat. There'’s a lot of the men...All of them are on crack. But they don'’t know they messing with the wrong man. [BOTH LAUGH] That boy, you get in his car, you ain'’t coming back out. You ain'’t coming unless you'’re dead. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] I got a message from Richard. He said he'’d just got out of the hospital after being beaten up by Lonnie'’s son, Christopher. BROOMFIELD: Hey, Richard. When did you first notice something weird was going on? When I first walked up to him, he was standing there waiting on me. When I walked up, well, he said,"Man, "I heard you'’ve been talking bad about my dad." And he looked down the street, and I turned around and looked, and I see four guys coming. So, and I turned back to him, he'’s backing up. And they walked up to me. One swung and he missed me. The other ones started hitting and as I'’m looking to see if Chris was gonna help me, Chris was getting in the car. He got in the car and drove off. It'’s the police in front of you. You got your seat belt on? Put your seat belt on. The police have just seen you. He just saw... He just looked in your car. Is he turning around?No. Don'’t think so. On the motorcycle.I don'’t think so. [SIREN WAILING] POLICEMAN: How you doin'’?Hi. POLICEMAN: You'’re gonna stop what you'’re doing, sir, as your right front passenger had no seat belt on... He'’s filming me, sir. He'’s filming a documentary. POLICEMAN: ID, sir? [INDISTINCT RADIO CHATTER] Give your registration and insurance as well please. My registration. Okay. Richard, are you okay? I'’m okay. Just getting a breather. Where did they kick you?Everywhere. Like where?Everywhere. My ribs... They tried to hit me in the face, but I was down like this. But I don'’t know how they did my jaw like that. No, they got balls in here to keep me from biting too hard. Were you involved in the Grim Sleeper case at all? POLICEMAN: No, sir. That'’s why it was so important to me that nobody knows or see you in the neighborhood. So you think he'’d do that to me, what'’d he have done to you guys? Do you think he'’ll do something?I know he will. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] We ran into Jerry. He'’s living homeless on the streets now. How'’s it going, fellas? How'’s it going, Nick? How'’s it going? How are you doing?Okay. I thought you were staying with gang buddies. Who that?On 80 something... 85th?Yeah. Yeah, I was, but it was too much trouble over there, too much hanging out. You know, me, I don'’t like crowds, because it'’s easy to get in, plus the police try to come around more and more over there. You know, because there'’s a lot of guys hanging out. So I'’m just on the streets now. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Jerry knew most of the women picked up by Lonnie, but he still hasn'’t been interviewed by police. BROOMFIELD: Did you get a feeling that he hated them? Yeah, he would torture a lot of women. A lot of them. He will. I mean, there had been times I was there when he tortured them. You know, they'’d howl and start crying, and he thought it was fun, he laughed, gave me that little funny grin, or he'’d wink an eye at me and let me know that, you know, he'’s just having fun. He never did show me no... How can I say this, that he was killing. I didn'’t see that in him, but I knew that he was torturing them a lot. And when I'’m saying a lot, I mean a lot of young ladies. You know...How many would you say? Huh?How many? I gotta say... Ooh, I mean, we used to go out every week. Every day. And weekends. We have... Weekends were just fun for us. '’Cause like I said, there'’s a lot of strawberries, lot of females like dealing cocaine. They call it crack, and they'’d do anything. I mean, we done picked the females, then we done gave two dollars, both of us to fuck, and we gave her two dollars. You know, I can'’t sit here and make no stuff up, because I was there. Actually, myself, I was there. And I know what we did. And what did he like to do with the girls? He liked to be rough with them. Like I said, fuck them in the ass, all that. And you know, sticking those thick balls and them sticks, screwdrivers up in them, you know. He would stick the handles of the screwdrivers, stick it in them and fuck '’em. You know? Or he'’d take the screwdriver and just ram them in the ass with it. You know. I had seen it. But, you know, I thought like, "Shit." At the time, I was still smoking while he was doing it. And it didn'’t bother me '’cause I was on crack. You know, there have been times I actually asked God to forgive me for what I did, you know, but I knew for a fact I didn'’t kill 'em. ♪ Oh, Lord ♪ How excellent [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Police say that Enietra Washington is the Grim Sleeper'’s sole surviving witness. ♪ How excellent [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] It was Saturday night November the 20th, 1988. Enietra was going to a party at a friend'’s house. Then make a right. Okay. Right here is the corner store. I was walking around the corner. BROOMFIELD: This store here? ENIETRA: And the car was parked where the little white car is. BROOMFIELD: Uh-huh. ENIETRA: I didn'’t see him, I saw his car. His car was a Pinto. I said, "That'’s really remarkable," '’cause I ain't seen a Pinto in like, years. I guess he saw me looking at his car. He asked me where I was going, and I said,"Oh, I'’m going to a party. "I'’m going around my girlfriend'’s house to let her do my hair." And he says, "Come on, I'’ll take you." BROOMFIELD: And then at what point did he pull the gun at you? When he turned the corner. All right. So you just got around the corner? And I was... Yeah, we had just... He just like got in the car, pulled out, and the next thing I knew, it was... He said, like I said, he said something to me, and I turned to ask him was he saying something, And everything got really quiet. And I was going, "Okay, what happened here?" You know, talking to myself, then I heard him say... I turned my head to say something, and he said, "Bitch, I'’ll shoot you again." I said, "[GASPS] You shot me?" Guess I must have passed out.Were you bleeding? Yeah. I must have passed out and I didn'’t know I passed out, but no... All of a sudden, I felt pressure on me, and I kinda like whatever got me out of it, he was on top, and I was there fighting him. And at what point did he rape you? I don'’t know. I passed out by then, and I didn'’t even know I passed out. Like I said, I woke up to the pressure that was upon my chest. That was hurting me so bad. Was he raping you then? Or he just got through, probably, and I was pushing him off. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] The bullet taken from Enietra'’s chest, a .25 caliber, was found by ballistics experts to have been fired from the same gun that was used in the murder of eight other women in the very same area. But this information was not released for another 20 years. The murders themselves, all involving black women from the South Central area weren'’t reported in theLA Times, and didn'’t even make it into the local news. The investigation moved at a snail'’s pace despite pressure from the Black Coalition. We had to press through sort of political connections to get somewhere from the sheriff'’s department to the table and all they could tell us is "We have a bullet, "and we are waiting for the gun that shot the bullet to come through the station." Like, really? What kind of police work is that? If you think that this person has killed just these 11 people, let'’s not even worry about what Margaret'’s talking about. Let'’s just take these 11. '’You're waiting for the gun "to come, you know, dressed fashionably and walk in to the station?" This is how I was talking to the detectives in the meeting. And say "Hey, here I am. Match me to the bullet if you can." It'’s not gonna happen. There was no movement on the sheriff'’s end. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Enietra Washington should have been invaluable to the police. She was able to describe the Grim Sleeper'’s car, the Pinto, in detail, the same orange-colored Pinto that Mary Lowe, the Grim Sleeper'’s previous victim, was seen getting into by a witness. Enietra was also able to bring detectives to the very street that Lonnie Franklin lived, the street that he would be arrested in 22 years later. All I remember is the side way that he walked around to the side. Um, it wasn'’t made like this, but I believe, I believe it was this house right here. They painted it '’cause it was green. BROOMFIELD: So this is Lonnie'’s house, and basically you told them... ENIETRA: Yeah, it was two houses down. BROOMFIELD: You thought it was not this house but the next one.ENIETRA: Right. BROOMFIELD: This one here.ENIETRA: Right. BROOMFIELD: And it then took the police another... twenty years to find Lonnie'’s house. ENIETRA: Right. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Enietra also provided the sketch of the Grim Sleeper which wasn'’t released until 2009, after theLA Weekly had already revealed there was a serial killer on the loose. Police told me that Enietra at the time was regarded as unreliable. Every black woman is a hooker, didn'’t you know? [LAUGHS] BROOMFIELD: And so they didn'’t take anything she said seriously. No, I mean, they got a sketch. But what did they do with the sketch? They didn'’t show the sketch to us. We didn'’t see that thing until over a decade later. You know, just the basic things that you do. You know, just the basic things that you do. When we talked to the detective in one of the meetings, he was saying that they did not put out a sketch because eyewitness sketches often are not that, um, reliable. And so, that'’s why they didn'’t put it out. I said, "Ooh, can I use you as an expert witness at my criminal defense cases "where my clients are picked up "based on eyewitness sketches "because strangely, they'’re super-reliable then." You know, you guys get up there and say, "Look, the eyewitness gave us the description, and we turned it into a sketch, "and it was close in time, and so, this is what the person must look like." Now you'’re telling me that these eyewitness sketches, they'’re not for nothing? This is wonderful. Give me your card. I need this information. Come on! [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Twenty-five years after the killing began, Lonnie Franklin was finally arrested in July 2010. ANTONIO VILLARAIGOSA: One man preyed on the innocent, stole the lives of women living in some of our toughest neighborhoods. Today, I'’m proud to announce that this terror has finally come to an end. WOMAN: Amen. [APPLAUSE] Thanks to the recent use of DNA evidence, and even more importantly, two decades of exhaustive detective work, 25 years of reviewing and reexamining evidence... BROOMFIELD: So what was your reaction to that press conference? [LAUGHS] Oh, the congratulatory one, where Jerry Brown was there? This was before he was elected governor. I thought it was quite a show. And that'’s one of the reasons I took the mic. Can I just... Can I just add to that? I'’m Margaret Prescod, founder of the Black Coalition Fighting Back Serial Murders. For us, it'’s been since 1985. I have a file here of documents going back to 1985 that were linear graphed. It'’s a very emotional time for us. Detective Kilcoyne, I'’m not gonna get up here and attack you. I know that we'’ve been critical, and... PRESCOD: I think they were a bit shocked. I don'’t think the police chief have had anybody take the mic from him before. If I were them, I would have done that whole thing a lot differently. But, you know, they wanted a whole PR job, they wanted to pat themselves on the back, they were the greatest thing since sliced white bread, and to really cover up all of what had gone on before, that was a big show, giving the impression that they were on the case, and now they had their guy. Yesterday... Yesterday the LAPD arrested Lonnie David Franklin Jr. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] I contacted Mayor Villaraigosa for an interview to get the city'’s point of view on the Grim Sleeper case. I received this reply. [BROOMFIELD READING OUT] I also tried to contact LA police chief, Charlie Beck, who wrote back. "The Department has revisited your request "and subsequently decided against granting an interview. "Given that the primary area of interest would be the Lonnie Franklin case, "neither the Chief nor any criminologists "from our Scientific Investigation Division "will be available for comment." We asked Dennis Kilcoyne, head of the Grim Sleeper Task Force and his replacement, Daryn Dupree, repeatedly over a year for an interview, but they both refused. We have done our job correctly... [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Margaret Prescod and the Black Coalition held their own press conference to put the record straight. PRESCOD: We'’re here to say loud and clear that every life is of value. Could you imagine if these murders had happened in Beverly Hills? [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] When Lonnie Franklin was finally arrested, it was by accident, and through his son Christopher'’s DNA. GARY: Lonnie was a breast man. He loved breasts. That'’s what they got the DNA from. On the bodies and stuff, they said the dead bodies, you know, the DNA, he had been sucking their breasts, and that'’s where the DNA is from. Now, like I said, do you know the story? The way that they supposed to have caught Lonnie was through his son Chris. Chris was arrested. Chris'’ DNA. They take your DNA when you get arrested now. Chris'’ DNA, they saying,"Hey. "This DNA match..." BROOMFIELD: Almost a perfect match.Almost a perfect match to these bodies and stuff that they have. So they'’re saying it had to be an uncle or a father... A close family member.A close family member. And then that'’s how they got him. From Lonnie to his son, you know. And they said, "Ooh, it'’s a match to Lonnie," and they followed Lonnie to this pizza place. and he was eating pizza at the pizza parlor, and then they got the DNA from an empty cup that he was drinking out of. And bam, they arrested him. They came to the house and they arrested him. That'’s how they got the DNA through him. And then the DNA on the girl, that'’s where the DNA come from, '’cause Lonnie was a titty sucker. He loves to suck titty. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] That'’s Lonnie Franklin walking around in the pizza parlor just before his piece of pizza was taken by police and used for DNA analysis. Four years later in court, Lonnie'’s lawyers are arguing that the DNA was incorrectly seized, and therefore, can'’t be used as evidence as it is a violation of his Fourth Amendment right. It is our issue that Mr. Franklin allowed his bodily fluid to be taken under control from what he thought was a restaurant employee. He believed it was going to be mixed, so the individualization of it would be no longer identified, and the general public would no longer have access to it until it was put into a container when you cannot identify individually for himself. Okay, what do you feel? I felt it was gonna be mixed with the rest of the trash. Okay. And, um... And then what did you think would happen to it once it was mixed with the rest of the trash? It would be disposed off.Okay. And what do you mean by "disposed off"? Thrown away. Just disposed off. You know, got rid of, in the trash.Okay. Individually or collectively?Collectively. And "collectively," what do you mean? With other... With other people'’s trash.Okay. JUDGE: I'’ve never heard of the term "informed consent" when it comes to eating food at a restaurant and having your items cleared from the table. You know, that'’s... really out there, Mr. Amster. So I'’m gonna find that once those items were put into the trash, and taken from the table, he no longer had Fourth Amendment interest in those items anymore. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Lonnie'’s lawyers are accused of stalling to delay the trial. I don'’t understand what he'’s been doing for a year. We have the July trial date. We'’re planning on going forward. What is the date when they'’ll be done with the DNA? I don'’t know.That'’s not an acceptable answer. Well, that'’s the answer I'’m giving. Well, I'’m asking the court to... Um, if we can'’t get... I'’ve never heard of this before, Well, I'’m sorry, Your Honor. If Your Honor wants to make a motion, to terminate me from this case, that will deter me from, Judge Almeida, I will be done with this thing. But I am pushing this. I'’ve got 18 murder sheets, I'’m pushing this as far as fast as I can, I am putting other cases out of the way, and if the court thinks there'’s somebody else that can do it faster, then let the court make the decision on this. Twenty-six... Where is it? [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Lonnie'’s son Chris called Pam. He wanted to meet up. Where do want? Twenty... Just a minute. Let me get it together. There you go. In the corner right there. Where?Right there now. A Honda. There. He'’s sitting there. I told you. That'’s his green car. So that'’s him. Howdy. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Christopher said his father had a lot of fans in law enforcement who admired him for cleaning up the streets. My dad has a lot of fans in fucking jail systems and... fuckin'’ weirdos in the street, uh... BROOMFIELD: Really? There'’s a lot of sick people out there. He got a lot of fan mail. It'’s crazy, man. People... I'’ve walked into sheriffs that were like, glorified that they were able to talk to me. "Oh, you'’re his son? Dude, that'’s fucking crazy." And you know, I got all pumped up, and I'’m just sitting there like, "Please put me on protective custody away from you "and the other fools over there." [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Chris was a prisoner himself for the very offense for which his DNA was taken, leading to Lonnie'’s arrest, when they both met in prison. Did you feel guilty about the DNA? DNA. Fuck, man! Like three years, man. I just got over that. I just got over that probably this year. Oh, yeah, you gotta deal with the people. The people, the people are... For me, man... I didn'’t know how to deal with that because I'’m from a line where we don'’t have no snitches. Nobody is a tattletale. What do you do? This is not third grade. But people, they look at me like that, like, oh, told on my dad, like... If I would have known, I don'’t even think I... I wouldn'’t have told. I had a few of my family members telling me that I'’d turned my dad in. You know, that was funny. You know, "My God, you sold your dad out. We'’re not talking to you anymore." I haven'’t talked to a lot of my family members based on that, because everyone thinks I'’ve turned my dad in. My family is cold. My family is real cold. When you first saw him after the arrest, did you hug? No, we were handcuffed, shackled. Head to toe. So we just sat there and twiddled our thumbs while we were talking. I mean, I probably would have shot us both if we didn'’t hug each other. What did he wanna talk about? We didn'’t even know. We were just there, just... silence. It'’s kind of... I gotta say... I don'’t know the word to use for that, but he speaks in a different... speaks in a different world, like he'’s not even in there for all the damn murders, he'’s in there for domestic violence or receiving a stolen property. And that kind of bothers me. And did he apologize to you or say anything to you? What? No. For what? [LAUGHS] This is really one of them stories where it'’s like... I don'’t believe this. No, seriously. No. No way. What would he apologize to me for? BROOMFIELD: Have you kind of suffered a lot through all this? CHRIS: I lost my best friend, man. That was my dude. There'’s nothing that I can talk to him about right now because we'’re in two different places. And it'’s hard for me to keep him up with what'’s going on. So, like I said, I lost my best friend. You know, you have somebody to call on any time. I just try. I try to communicate with him, you know, just... I'’m still his son. Can'’t nobody change that. So... I just try and be there for him as far as, you know, this is a tough situation... What was the first thing he talked about? I gotta say, my dad was really... Sometimes he talks about how the attorneys are, you know, doing what they can and they'’re getting to the bottom of things, or... Clear his name, and other stuff, like he'’s innocent. To the point. Yeah. What do you think about that? It'’s all a mind game. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] In the past, Los Angeles police used the term "NHI," police slang for "No Human Involved" to describe the murders of prostitutes and drug addicts. Many feel this attitude continues today. Hi!BROOMFIELD: Hi. There'’s Mikey right there. See her? That'’s Mikey.That'’s Mikey. See her? That'’s Mikey. There she go. Where she at? Mikey, show '’em you're there. That'’s Mikey right here. [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] These are all Grim Sleeper survivors Pam managed to find. They all were too scared to talk to police. BROOMFIELD: And why were you looking like that? I had fallen asleep. Nodded out or something. Why? Did he give you drugs?Yeah. I was using drugs real bad at the time. Shall we go in? [BROOMFIELD NARRATING] Pam brought them to our office because most of them live on the streets, and they'’re scared to be seen talking with us. Officially, Enietra Washington is the only surviving witness, but in reality, there are many. BROOMFIELD: So what'’s your name? Cookie. And how long have you been on the street? Uh, since I was 18. And how long did you meet Lonnie? About six to seven months. You were with him?Yes. Ten times or more? Yeah, maybe more. Yeah, I have been with him more, sexually. Why did you go with him so many times? '’Cause he paid me. You know, I was prostituting real, you know, heavy then, so... It was about the money. I'’m not a prostitute nor a whore. You know, I meet men on the streets and they'’d be nice to me, but this particular night, this man wasn'’t nice. I met him in '’90... '’87. '87. I think '’91, '92. 2012. I mean 2007. And he had approached me, very kind man, sweet guy, and asked me if I smoked. I told him, "Yeah." It was one late night, I was walking down the street, um, yes, I do drugs, I was high at the time, was trying to get more money to get more drugs, and a van pulled up. I'’d seen him circle the block. He kept circling the block. He pulled over, and asked me do I wanna get high, mm, and do I need some money. So I said, "Sure." So I get in, and I take my block down, I keep the window down, little safety, '’cause at nighttime, your voice carries if you scream. He seemed nice, you know, intelligent, in the beginning. And he asked me why would a pretty girl like me be out there smoking. Did I wanna go with him? So I walked with him, and we got in his car, and he took me to his house. The man'’s house is nasty. Where would he take you? In his garage. He never wanted to go in the bedroom, you know. And he had pictures of a lot of girls and stuff. Crossed out. He used to have them crossed out. He was weird '’cause we had... He wanted to do different things, he wanted to do stupid stuff. I got naked, he showed me the money but he never put it in my hands. Uh, then he started, he wanted me to give him head and stuff. It was okay for me to do that, but he never gave me the money. It was normal at first, and then he started doing weird things, asked me to do weird... you know... sex with things, with bottles, and... He would ask me to just take like a 40-ounce bottle and stick it in my pussy, and I wouldn'’t do it. You know, after he done played with himself with it or something like that. Or paid me to go get other girls and stuff, you know, and after that I never seen them girls again or heard from '’em, you know. How many? I brought him like maybe four of '’em. He paid me, but I'’ve never seen them again after that. Did police ever talk to you? No, I never talked to the police. No. He took me to his house on Western in 81st, uh, at the time, I believe the house was like green. Green? Yes. The house was green. I remember that everything in it was like soundproof. No one can hear you outside. He wanted to put the handcuffs on me. He wanted to put the handcuffs, one against the bed, you know, hang me up. And it scared me. I mean, no. I was scared. Yes, I was. It was one door that he had locked from inside and... I knew. So when he'’s saying that I wasn'’t trying to abide by what he wanted me to do, then he started getting aggressive. You know, telling me, "Oh, you'’re gonna give me some head. "You know you'’re gonna give me some head." And I'’m like, "Give me money," you know? And he was like, "Oh, you'’re gonna get the money." I tried to help him out of his pants, but... I couldn'’t. You couldn'’t?I couldn'’t. I... I... It was like picking up an egg. Mm-mm. And his body was... It was like he had been in a freezer. His body was cold. His body... Part of his body, it was cold. And nothing was happening. I couldn'’t... I couldn'’t help him. He got out the van and got to the... He picked my clothes. I guess he was taking my clothes so I can'’t put them back on. During the process when he was getting out the van, he left the van door cracked a little bit. I took off and ran down the street. I ran halfway down the block butt-naked, and this lady I seen, I was screaming, asking her for help, she let me in her car and she dropped me off at a friend'’s house. I keep Visine on me '’cause it puts people to sleep. It really works. I keep Visine. and so I had some Visine and, uh, and I had him get a drink. I had him get a Remy. I remember I had him go get a Remy. And I put him to sleep. I didn'’t insult him. The Grim Sleeper?Yes, I didn'’t belittle him. You know, I didn'’t mock his body. And then you wanna kill me? And I didn'’t do that? I didn'’t try to rob you, I didn'’t set you up, I didn'’t do any of that. Yeah, okay, yeah, I was out there. That doesn'’t mean I'’m nothing. That doesn'’t mean I'’m nothing. Like I'’m a piece of trash. I was trapped. I was trapped. I was trapped. It'’s not what I wanted. That'’s not what I wanted. That'’s not the life I wanted. PAM: What I'’m trying to explain to you and say to you is that just because they have Lonnie doesn'’t mean this is over with. There'’s another motherfucker out there just as sick as he is. You know what I mean? [INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PLAYING]
