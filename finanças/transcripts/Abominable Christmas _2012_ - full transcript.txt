[ chirping ] [ music playing ] [ chirping ] [ laughs ] Oh, just look at it. It's so beautiful. All that color. All I see is trouble. I'm just looking at the lights, Adam. I'm not doing anything wrong. That's fine. Just do your looking from behind this rock, please. Don't you want to see? Awesome. Amazing. Best thing I've ever seen. Can we go home now? [ sighs ] Fine, scaredy-cat. Let's go. [ growling ] Ahh! [ whimpers ] [ sighs ] Oh, Dad, it's just you. Huh? You're lucky it's just me. What have I told you about walking around in the open? What if a human saw you? I only wanted to look at the lights. That's all it takes. You didn't even hear me coming. Yeah, but you're you. If you were human, I would have heard you. Abby, that is not the point. It only takes one time. You know what humans are like. You know what they're capable of. But, Dad, you've met one human. They can't all be bad. I mean, how can humans be so awful when they make this? The colors, the lights, presents, the music, the food! They have so much fun at Christmas. We come here every year, but we never get to see any of it. Christmas isn't about presents and all that stuff, Abby. It's about family, being together, which means staying safe on the mountain. But, Dad-- No buts. I couldn't bear it if anything happened to you. I know it's hard, sweetie. There are so few of us left, and we have so little land left to hide in. I just don't want you to end up in a cage. And you, Adam, I expect more from you. She made me come here. You think I care about lights? I was scared, promise. I don't want you to be scared. I want you to be smart. Promise me you'll look after your sister and keep her out of trouble. I promise. Thanks a lot. You're welcome a lot. I'm gonna go catch a few fish for dinner. Stay safe. DAD: Stay safer! [ gasps ] Hmph. [ snowmobile engine racing ] All right, where are you? No signs of subject. Surroundings are perfectly white, meaning subject is either totally camouflaged or not present. Tense, yet attentive, the scientist must remain ready at any-- I don't need to be writing all of this, do I? [ gasps ] Isn't that... Margaret Knowhow. See? This is exactly the kind of situation Dad warned us about, but did you listen? No. Shh. What is she doing here? Same thing she does every year. She looks for us. You know, Dad should talk. If he hadn't been seen by her all those years ago, then maybe we could run free up here. Get down! Use your head. She could see us. She could capture us. Or even worse, Dad could find out. Okay, Margaret, if you were an Abominable Snowman, where would you hide? Think like a snowman. Think abominably. [ rustling ] Lower elevation has more food, but I suspect you stay as high as possible, giving you better hiding places. She's coming right towards us. We have to go up the mountain. You heard her. That's what she expects. We have to go down the mountain. We're not supposed to go down. We're supposed to go up. Dad is up the mountain. We don't want to lead her to him. Down the mountain. Trust me. Whoa! Dad said I was in charge. No, he said to make sure nothing happens to me. I'm in charge. You're my bodyguard. [ groans ] [ gasps ] Whoa! It can't be. It can't be! It is! Gotcha. Uh-oh! [ growls ] ABBY: Whee! [ gasping ] Can we slow down? [ laughs ] [ sputters ] Whaah! [ Abby laughs ] Whoo hoo! Whee! This is so much fun! [ laughs ] Let's do that again! [ groans ] Let's not. [ dog barking ] Abby? No, no, no, no, no, no, no! [ latch opens ] Huh? [ gasps ] [ grunting ] A little help? [ typing ] [ sighs ] [ grunts ] Don't get up, really. You might hurt yourself. [ grunting ] [ panting ] Thanks for the help, Matt. Hmm. Where's Dad? Yes, I know, but if we lose two weeks, we'll never deliver on time. Well, if your client had delivered that on time as promised-- Yes, yes. I know. I--I know. But if you... [ sighs ] Who's ready for dinner? Abby? Adam? Margaret. [ groans ] [ laughs ] [ giggles ] Time to go, Abby. Abby, what are you doing? Uh, escaping the crazy lady? Into a house with three other humans who will put us in a cage? No wonder you're in charge. You're a genius. That little girl looked just like us, except, you know, hairless. She's harmless, and the two male ones don't seem to notice anything. What did Dad say about humans? [ gasps ] We can act like one of those wolf creatures that live in the house. You mean a dog? Yeah. When we're ready to go, we'll just whine when we get inside like we have to pee, and she'll let us out. That breaks all of Dad's rules. Except for the one where he said you had to protect me. Heh. [ music on headphones ] Hey, Matt, want to help me decorate the tree? [ typing ] Hmph. [ scratching ] [ laughs ] Dad! Dad, can I get a doggie? Yes, whatever, dear. I need to finish this call. [ laughs ] Can I have two doggies? Fine. Fine. Sorry about that. My daughter. Something about toffees. Hey, there, little doggie. Meow. Dogs bark. Oh. Um... woof! Woof! What kind of dog are you? Do you want some water or food? Be right back. This is so much fun. [ typing ] Great. Dad has to be really worried right now. That's why you need to stay here and protect me. He'll be happy later when he finds out you made such a good, safe decision. What is better? Outside running from the crazy lady or in here with lights, music, chocolate? How do you always get your way? It's a lot of hard work. Trust me. Fine, but as soon as possible, we're back up the hill. And, remember, we're dogs. Wahoo! Hee hee! I didn't have any dog biscuits, so I figured that I'd-- Cookies! [ groans ] Good job with the whole pretending to be a dog thing. Oops. No way. No way. No way. No way. No way. This can't be happening. Please, ma'am. We're very gentle. If you open the door, we'll just go back outside. No need for any rash decisions or sudden movements, and definitely no need for any cages. This is... awesome! I have talking dogs! Or you could see it as a positive, also a valid reaction. Also, dogs can't talk. We're Abominable Snowmen. Looks like they made it into town. Time to go incognito. Christmas with humans. What could be worse? My dad isn't a big fan of pets or messes. What about your mom? Well, she's... Our mom's gone, too. I used to decorate the tree with my mom, but... We'd love to help you. Do you know how? I don't know much about lights, but I do know trees. [ laughing ] [ laughs ] Go, Abby. Uh-oh! [ laughs ] Whaah! [ sighs ] Got it. [ typing ] [ giggles ] [ claps ] There's no light coming out. How do we make them shine? You have to plug them in. Whoo hoo! Whaah! Whoa! [ Abby yips ] Whoa! [ giggles ] Watch out! Flying brother! [ crash ] [ door opens ] FATHER: Lily, please keep it down in there. It sounds like you're throwing a party. [ door closes ] [ laughs ] We kind of are. It's kind of fun. I'm kind of stuck. [ both laughing ] [ grunts ] Whoa. Ahem. [ grunts ] Abby? [ giggling ] [ grunts ] Cool. Whoo hoo! [ knocking on door ] [ door opens ] It's okay, Lily. I got it. [ gasps ] [ panting ] Uh, can I help you? Yes. I'm looking for some, um, creatures. They're white, very sneaky. Creatures? Well, yes. You see, I'm a scientist, and I was out researching them in the woods. I've only seen them once 20 years ago... What is she saying? I don't know. You keep talking. Shush. And if I could just capture them, you know, show the scientific community a live specimen, ah, you can only imagine the grants, the research. We'd definitely research the beasts... [ gasps ] and then finally they'll see I was right, I'm not crazy! [ laughs ] Of course you wouldn't want people to think that you were crazy. That would be, uh, baseless. Stop pushing. Are you sure? No creatures at all? White, fluffy ones? Yes. Now if you'd please take your arm out of the door... No dogs? No. We have no dogs or creatures or anything of the sort. We don't even have a fish. Now, if you don't mind... Thank you. Now good evening. You'll let me know if you do-- see something? Really, that woman was a little pushy. [ typing ] Oh, Lily, the tree looks wonderful. Matt, did you tell your sister you like the tree? Mm. Do you like it, Daddy? Absolutely. You have an eye for decorations just like your mom. [ panting ] Lily, why are there... dogs in the house? White, "furry" dogs, to be exact? You said I could have them, Daddy. Aren't they cute? Where did you get them? I found them. You found two white, fluffy dogs? Then a little later, a woman comes by looking for white, fluffy dogs? Lily, you know you can't keep them. They belong to this other woman. A crazy woman? We don't know that she's crazy. Yes, we do. Dad, you heard her. They aren't her pets. Woof! And she wants to put them in a cage and do research on them. Well, they belong to someone. I'm gonna call the local pound to see if anyone is looking for two white dogs. Until then, I suppose they can stay here. Thanks, Daddy. Woof! What kind of dogs are they, exactly? Um, you know, uh, white Russian fur trade dogs. They are really rare. [ panting ] Ow! I'll train them. You'll barely notice they're here. Very odd dogs. Hopefully Margaret hasn't found them yet. Whoa! [ grunting ] Well, well, well. Out at night with no tags. That's a violation of City Code 92. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to bring you in. [ grunting ] I can't have you endangering innocent citizens. Get in there, big guy, [ sighs ] Whew! [ humming ] "Boy, you did a good job today, Mr. Dogcatcher." "Thank you, Mr. President. I was just doing my job." [ laughs ] [ grunts ] [ humming a tune ] [ truck door closes ] [ engine starts ] Oh, you have to try this. These are my favorite, chocolate macaroons. Mm, that's great. Try this, Adam. [ groans ] I think I've had too much. Yep, too much. What else? This is peppermint ice cream. Don't you like it? It's a little cold. Good, but, you know, for us, everything is cold. Now, what are those? Oh, whatever it is, it's awfully sticky. That's a cupcake. [ laughs ] You're supposed to eat it this way. You might want to take off the-- Never mind. Can I have another one? [ belches ] [ stomach rumbling ] I can't believe I'm saying this, but do you have any vegetables? Um, maybe we should move on to something else. Like music. [ gasps ] Christmas music? Yes. Oh! I've always wanted to hear some. [ instrumental playing ] What are you doing? Heh. Dancing. See? You just wiggle around. Feel the beat. [ both laughing ] Whoo! [ laughing ] That's funny. [ all laughing ] FATHER: What's all the noise about? [ kids gasp ] [ music stops ] We're, um-- I'm just dancing. [ panting ] [ music resumes ] [ laughs ] Hey, sounds like fun. Come on, Dad. [ laughs ] Hey. [ laughing ] That looks nothing like dancing. [ both laughing ] [ dogs barking ] What are you in for? [ whimpers ] Ohh, canines. [ entry bell rings ] [ barking ] Let's get you boys fed. Easy as 1, uh, 2, 3. Easy combo. Here you go, boys! Eat up! Delicioso. Man, this stuff stinks. [ humming a tune ] Out of my way, boys. [ barks ] [ whimpering ] [ barks ] [ sighs ] You're not useful at all, are you? Okay. Okay. [ entry bell rings ] Okay. Hello, ma'am. How can I help you today? MARGARET: Well, let's say I think I saw an animal somewhere that I think doesn't belong there. Could you go and pick it up? Well, now, ma'am, that all depends. Our job is to collect animals off the street who may or may not have homes. We try to return animals to their homes and not take them out of the above-said homes. Does the animal in question have tags or a license? Please verify. I don't know. Does that matter? Well, if they are registered to that owner, then I can tell you really quickly if they do in fact belong there. Are they livestock or domestic animal? For example, is it like a cow or like maybe a dog? Please be specific. Well, I guess it's a little of both. That's a cow, and this is a d-- Oh, that's a cat, but I have a picture of a dog somewhere back here. I don't know. I've only really seen it twice, and that's what I want to research. The reason I ask is that we do sometimes pick up animals from a domicile if it is determined that that house is not zoned for livestock. For example, you cannot have chickens in a kitchen. Yes, great. The place is not zoned. Now can we go get them? Absolutely. If you will just fill out these forms there, and once they've been processed, we can go investigate your complaint in three to five business days. But-- Ma'am, it will only take a few minutes. Please use a number two pencil. [ sighs ] I've got to find a way out of here. [ laughter ] [ grunting ] [ sighs ] Let's do this Abominable style! [ laughing ] Whee! Wow! [ laughs ] There is something strange about those dogs. [ laughing ] Let's do that again! [ groans ] Really! Oh, this is outrageous. Great! So we'll notify you in three to five business days. Thank you. You've been so helpful. Hey, Dave. Hey, Al. How's it going? Oh, you know, the usual. Listen to the kids tell me what they want for Christmas. Real nice day. Man, it is always good to make people happy at the holidays. Don't you know it? Santa can't be everywhere at once. Somebody's gotta help the big guy out. Heh. Well, make sure the big guy puts me on the nice list, 'cause I have been pretty sweet all year long. You betcha! Heh. I'll put in a good word. I will see you later, Officer Al. Ah, sure. I'll see you in the morning. ♪ Rudolph, the big-nosed reindeer ♪ [ whimpers ] ♪ Had a real bright and shiny nose ♪ Yep. [ yawns ] [ snoring ] [ muttering ] [ entry bell rings ] What? Who was that? [ gate creaks ] Oh ho. Oh, boy, oh, boy. That could have been real bad. Good thing none of the animals got out. Phew! Don't want to chase any animals tonight. [ yawns ] [ snoring ] [ exhales ] Yes! I win! ♪ Oh, yeah, go, Adam ♪ ♪ Go, go, go, Adam, oh ♪ [ laughs ] Shh, shh. [ barks ] Oh, hi, Daddy. Are you playing a board game? No, I'm just moving all of our pieces around. Ah. Well, I need to do some last-minute shopping, and I thought you might want to go. Whoo-hoo-hoo! I'll get my jacket! [ barks ] Let's bring the dogs, too, give 'em a walk... and make sure they don't break the house. Whoa! Matt, you want to come? Ehh. [ laughs ] [ laughs ] [ laughter ] I can do this. Hi, Santa! Uh... hello. Santa, come on. You're late. Um, but-- Are you going to keep all those kids waiting? Yay! Santa! Wait your turn, kids. That is a great beard, Al. Where'd you get it? Much fuller than yesterday. Nice touch. So this year, Santa, I want to be perfectly clear with what I want from you. So number one, a pony, number two, a laptop, number three, cellphone. number four... So that's it. Try to get it right this year, okay? Yeah, I will make extra sure you get everything you deserve. Not exactly... So, what do you want? A puppy to push around? More candy to fatten you up? I want my mom to be happy again. She's always crying since my dad went away. I don't know what to do. Can you help me, Santa? Well, that's a hard one, but you are on the good list, so I'll see what I can do, but in the meantime, you give your mother lots of hugs. You'd be surprised how happy you can make her. Thank you, Santa. Psst, Adam! What? Look over there. It's Dad. Where? Santa Claus in the middle of the square. Why is Dad dressed like Santa? Adam, get down. Why should I get down? [ gasps ] Young Abominable Snowmen, and, yes, I saw them with my own eyes, and, when I catch them, you will have your proof, too. [ gasps ] There they are! It's her. [ laughs ] Quick! Dad, we have to go. And I want a dog, and I'm gonna name him-- Abby! Adam! Sorry. Ho ho. Oh, gosh. Sorry I'm late. I couldn't find my Santa suit for the life of me! [ Abby laughs ] [ groans ] It's her. Now, young lady, you're gonna tell me what is going on. I make a point not to run, so this had-- had better be important. It's my fault. Don't be mad at Lily. It talks? [ both laugh ] I knew there was something strange about those dogs. [ groans ] And you are two little Abominable Snowmen, who really don't exist, but have somehow ended up in my house and are now my daughter's pets because you wanted to see Christmas, and there's a crazed scientist chasing you and your father? Okay, well, let's be rational then. [ laughs ] The first thing is to get you back to safety and with your father. But-- No. Regardless of how completely insane the situation is, if anything ever happened to you, I don't know what I'd do. Now, I'm sure you didn't mean to do anything wrong, but your father must be worried sick, and here, you could get into a lot of trouble, especially with that Margaret woman chasing you. The safest place for you is back in the woods. I hadn't thought about it that way. I just wanted to see the lights and presents. Christmas is about more than that, Abby. It's about being with your family. I guess we should go home. Ah, finally! Whoa! [ laughing outside ] I found them! And how may I assist you? The Abominable Snowmen, I found them. Finally, I can resume my position as the new bright young zoologist, no longer the outcast. All those years of being criticized will soon be worth it. Oh, they will eat their words. Uh, ma'am, did you just say, "The Abominable Snowman"? 'Cause you do know those don't exist, right? Oh, they do. I'll show you. You see? Huh? Look! It's two dogs! They aren't wearing any tags! No tags? That's just not up to code! Let's go! [ footsteps ] ...prove what I said so many years ago, that Abominable Snowmen exist. [ laughs ] [ knock on door ] It has been brought to my attention that you have two unlicensed creatures in your domicile. That is Latin for "home." We don't have any animals here. Unh! [ nervous laugh ] According to City Code number 84297-alpha, I have been authorized to search this residence and take the animals into my custody. See? There they are. Ma'am, I'm gonna have to ask you to step back! [ growls ] And what will happen if the supposed animals go into your custody? We will hold the dogs for a period of time, allowing you to file the proper paperwork. That usually takes three to five business days. After that, the animals can come home with you. Otherwise, the animals can at that time be adopted by any other family. [ laughs ] No one else will be able to take them from the pound in that time? No, sir. The animals will be guarded around the clock by myself or Officer Al. Dad, no! Please, you can't let him take them! It's only for a few days. Don't worry. I promise you'll be safe. We'll find a way to get you out. For now, this also keeps you locked away from Margaret. You were right about humans. I'm sorry. Hey, I'm your brother. I'm going to make sure you're okay. Now, aren't you the least bit flexible with your policy? Perhaps I can watch the dogs. Ma'am, as I told you, the owner has three to five business days to file the proper paperwork. At that time, if he has not laid claim to these animals, you can then file, not before. Thank you very much. Have a nice day. Yes, yes, I know. The proper paperwork. I don't have that kind of time. [ sighs ] Perhaps I could take some pictures of the animals at your facility for scientific purposes? I'll have to check our regulations, but, you know, it's probably okay. Just a picture. Don't tell anyone. Thank you. Ahh. I promise we will get them out of there safe, Lily. [ knock on door ] Lily... were there any more of those creatures? [ gasps ] Are you their dad? [ sighs ] Oh. Heh. Good. I was worried you were going to scream. We don't have a lot of time. Wow, you are really big. Where are they? The dogcatcher took them. I'm sorry. It was the only way we could keep them locked up away from Margaret. We have to rescue them. You don't know what that woman is like. Why is she so obsessed? It's me. When I was younger and more careless, she spotted me in the woods. She was a scientist, but when she told others about me, they thought she was crazy. She's been obsessed ever since. Then we'd better go. Okay, Lily, you stay here. [ typing ] Watch your brother. But, Dad, you might need me. Please, Lily? I don't want any more kids to be in jeopardy. [ entry bell rings ] I know something everybody else does not. I want to be heralded with prizes and money and fame... Ohh! Shh. You think this'll work? He won't just capture you? I think it's our only way in. The back door is bolted shut. We don't want to waste any time. Let's go. [ typing, music playing on headphones ] [ gasps ] Will you put that stupid computer down and connect with the real world and your family for, like, five minutes, please? The world is ending, and you have no idea whatsoever! Hmph. Hmph. [ typing stops ] Yes? Oh. Um, I didn't think you'd look up. But, well, I'm not sure where to start, but, see, I got these two dogs. Well, they were Abominable Snowmen, and some crazy lady is chasing them, but then the pound got them, and now Dad and the Abominable Snowman, their dad, is trying to save them, but I'm pretty sure he's going to make it worse, and I really need your help. [ clock ticking ] You don't believe me, do you? Of course I do. What do you think I've been blogging about the last few days? I mean, this is awesome! Do you know how many conspiracy theorists there are on the Internet? I've gained thousands of new followers, a few advertisers. Sorry. So I agree Dad is gonna mess this up. Here's what we do. [ dogs barking ] Yes, I have two confirmed specimens. Well, if you want the exclusive, you'd better hurry. I have offers from Channel 12 and the Innovation Channel. Yes, I'll see you soon. [ entry bell rings ] Oh, and bring a couple of camera crews. You'll want plenty of footage. Question for you, sir-- are you here to drop that big dog off? I'm afraid we need to take those two animals from you. With flea spray and a meat bone? I am a trained professional. You must be joking. Admittedly, not the best weapons, but... I'm sure they'll still cause discomfort and injury. Now hand over the keys. [ martial arts yells ] I'll have you know I was a three-time badge champion in the Scouts in hand-to-hand combat. No one messes with my animals! Dad! Dad! Abby! Adam! I'm sorry. I'm sorry I led us all here. We're together now, and I know a way out. [ grunts ] Hey, I'm not an animal! Sorry, sir. I can't untie the dangerous beast, and I can't let the beast go, so you're stuck. However, since you are a human being, I will need to do one thing. Yep, that should hold you. [ entry bell rings ] What happened? Okay, this man here and the talking dog tried to disarm me and take the two other dogs. Ohh! [ gasps ] Margaret. [ laughs ] That's terrible! Are you okay? That was very brave. It was pretty brave, but I'm just doing my job. Well, I think this really shows that this man is in no way fit to take care of these two dogs. Perhaps now would be the time to review the paperwork I submitted a few days ago on the two animals. I think that I could best take care of them in this case. FATHER: No, please! You don't know what she'll do to them. [ entry bell rings ] Here! I think you'll find all the paperwork is in order. Form 22857-delta? Ho. Ho. How did you know about that? Little man, that is so impressive. I have my ways. Truly, dude, that is impeccable paperwork. Look at this. Amazing, totally amazing. That's amazing. I've never seen that before. Ah, looks like these little guys are all yours. But--But--But-- You sure are a big fella! [ laughs ] I'm very sorry. I had no idea these animals were protected, sir. Well, you were only doing your job. Whoa! Wow. [ laughs ] [ gasps ] But... you can't let him have them! [ all gasp ] Hah. [ laughs ] Oh. No one messes with my daddy. [ gasps ] [ grunts ] Ow. [ growls ] Ma'am, attacking an endangered species is a Code 186-niner-delta-bravo x-ray-watermelon violation. I'm afraid I'm gonna have to call the police! [ growls ] Ohh! Please don't make me use my taser! Well, if you don't need us anymore... Yeah, I got it covered! Have a great Christmas. [ tires skid ] But--But-- But--But--But-- I'm here for an interview. Are you Margaret Knowhow? [ siren blaring ] 5-O! 5-O! I'm gonna have to ask you to step back! But--But--But-- [ sighs ] I can't thank you enough for keeping Abby and Adam safe. I know you would have done the same. Well, I guess this is goodbye. Dad, can we have them over for Christmas dinner? Yeah, Dad. Please? We have plenty of food. [ chuckles ] That sounds great. Whoo-hoo! Whah! [ stomach rumbles ] [ belches ] [ laughs ] But--But--But-- [ sighs ] Cool. Oh, I almost forgot. I got you a thank-you gift. [ laughs ] Don't look at me. I had nothing to do with this. [ dog barking ] [ gasps ] I just figured since we had to go home and everything, you might miss having a dog. Just a little thank-you. [ barks ] [ laughs ] Can I keep him, Dad? [ laughs ] Fine. [ all laughing ] [ instrumental playing ]
