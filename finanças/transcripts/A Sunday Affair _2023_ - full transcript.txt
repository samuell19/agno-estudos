This is my favorite spot. I've never brought anyone here before. You know I really like beaches, right? Then he can piss off. I'm staying with you. Don't go crazy on me now. You've been wanting to get together with him for months. There'll be other guys, Toyin, but there's only one us. Pinky promise? You know you want to. You know you want to. You know... That's my girl! What is love? Love gives us life. Without love, what are we? Nothing. We're nothing without love. Now, remember, John 15, verse 13. "No greater love hath a man than to lay down his life for his friend." Not just men, women too. Not just friends, husbands and wives. Maybe. Could you be more thirsty? I mean, at the actual ceremony? Girl! When Mama sees what she sees, she cannot unsee. Hey! You made me promise that I would watch you today. So, I got my eye on you. I'll be good. I'll be good. Pinky swear? - No, not today. I don't trust you. Mm-mm. - Pinky promise? Wow, my friend! Look at how beautiful you are! Look how beautiful you are too! - Mm! All of this. - Oh! - You'll find a husband today! - No, please! Three! Two! One! Whoo! Hell, no! Here you go. Thank you, Lord! - Suits your dress. - Yeah. It's a wedding, get yourself something nice. A man, maybe. For goodness' sake, I told you. I am done with men. - Ugh! - More spare for me then. Oh, knock yourself out. Stay here. Promise? - Pinky swear. - Good. Thank you. What are you doing? Are you trying to make me look stupid? You couldn't… You couldn't just keep it together for a few hours? You want him? You can have him. He's yours! Oh. Hello. Mmm… Shoo. Oh, Jesus. What… Where are you taking me to? Where would you want to go? I think I better go after my wife. I don't know, she seemed very angry. Maybe I'm safer with her than with you. That could be true. You are trouble. So you want to get neck deep into trouble? Ooh. Uche, I hope you're not doing what I think you're doing. Oh, no! No, girl, not another husband! You made me promise I'd watch you! Ooh! Sorry. So sorry. No kissing. I'm Uche, sister of the bride. Pleased to meet you. Brother of the groom, but my real name is Akin. Ah! The one I never met. Well, I've been living in the US for a while. I'm in town for the wedding and business. Well, there's, uh, an event at my gallery, - tomorrow evening, six o'clock. - Mm-hmm. Genesis Gallery, Ikoyi. Don't bring the wife. Your sister is ready to cut the cake. Ah, my lovely BFF Toyin. Sunday. Nice to meet you. I think I met your wife and daughter earlier? Femi's… Half-brother. Very nice. Kelechi is waiting, so… It was really lovely to meet you. Nice to meet you. Why do I even bother? The boy is very handsome, please. You, eh! Ah, God. Toyin, answer this phone. Sam, not now. Oh, God. - Sam-Sam! - Uche! - Mm… - Uche-Uche! - Mm-hmm. - You look beautiful. Thank you, Sam. I'd love to speak with the owner of this gallery. Well, the owner of this beautiful gallery is on her way to giving a welcome speech. Oh! But you have to welcome me first. Mm? - Sam, people are waiting. - Let them wait! Sam, my hair and makeup… I promise, I won't touch your hair. - Okay. - Mm? Uh, Sam, come to the flat and we'll do it properly there. - Okay? Later. - We'll do it properly now. - Mm? - No! - Yes, Uche! - Please, Sam, stop it! - Come on! - Yes! Eunice? - Everyone's ready. - All right, then. I'll be... You should come. It's our big night. Come on. -Thank you, everyone. What an evening. Art is alive. Welcome to the Genesis Gallery, and the celebration of an exciting new voice. - Enigma. - Thank you. I am passionate about art, and Enigma is... Never mind who he is. Excuse me. Ladies and gentlemen… do you all know who I am and why this gallery even exists? Well, yes. You... You all know Sam Okafor. Uh, my... my business partner. That's her very married sugar daddy. And principal investor in... This gallery. Now, ladies and gentlemen, it is very important to recognize people who put magic into your lives. Mm? You shouldn't have. - Uche. - Sam. Ladies and gentlemen, Uche. Whoo! I'm so sorry. I was actually on my way and then I got a last-minute crisis call. I feel so humiliated. In front of everybody. I feel like his mistress, a whore. Uche, please, don't forget who you are. Don't allow any man treat you like that. And the next time he tries that nonsense, just punch him in his face! We're not 12 anymore. -I know. Look at you. It's okay. And you are the toughest woman I know. I'm done being tough! - I know. - Am I being too harsh? Not at all. You want to stay back, watch a movie? And then we can eat chocolate and I can feel better. As much as I would love that, I have an early start tomorrow. Ibadan, doctor. Remember? You are the stronger one, I know this. I always thought that. Well, what can I say? We're both made of stronger stuff. -Come here. - Stop crying. - Thank you. Sorry. - I love you. - I love you, too. Artificial insemination, also known as IUI, is the insertion of a thin, flexible catheter into the cervix to inject washed sperm directly into the uterus, for women struggling with unexplained infertility. Excuse me. Um, sorry, I don't want to sit on your bag. Is this your seat? Yes, number 4A it is. Thank you. I know you. We met at the wedding. - I'm glad you like trains. - What? I said I'm glad you like trains. And who said I like trains? It gets me where I need to go, so… I like trains. Wow, good for you. I guess you don't like me. I don't even know you. But I know your type. What is my type? Listen, I'm sure you're slick, or you think so, but save your breath. I don't like men that cheat on their wives. I think you got me mixed up with someone in your past. If you're gonna keep talking to me, I'm just gonna have to get up and find another seat. No spare seats. Looks like we're stuck together. Are you actually trying to annoy me? Yeah. A little bit. Victory at last! Oh, no victory. Okay, okay, just a little bit. Little bit of victory. I just want to watch my video in peace. - No worries. - Thank you. No problem. So, let's start again. My name is Sunday. Toyin. - And we're not going to be friends. - Nice to meet you, Toyin. Under normal circumstances during a woman's menstrual cycle, she would release a mature egg that moves down the fallopian tube where it can be fertilized, awaiting the arrival of healthy… We will run the physical exams. - Okay. Which includes the blood work and genetic tests. Then, we will schedule insemination based on your ovulation cycle. - Okay. - Questions? No. I'm ready. 100% decided? Absolutely 100%. - All right, then, let's make a baby! - Let's do it! I just know that you're going to make an amazing mother. Thank you. I've wanted a baby for so long. And you will have one. - I'm so sorry, sir. Bandits came out. - This happens every week! - I'm so sorry. - Is this a joke? - It's not a joke, sir. - When did this happen? Think it was about... around 12:00 noon. And where was your supervisor? Now, you're telling me nobody knew of this till when? I don't really know, but I hope that it will be resolved soon. You guys gotta be kidding me! What's going on? - Trains are not moving. - What? How do trains not move? - Sabotage on the tracks. - No way! Yeah, I know. This is embarrassing for me. For you? Well, I lead the consortium that's responsible for expanding the train tracks across the country. Here's my card. All right, Mr. Big Shot. How am I supposed to get home now? I can guarantee you we'll have a train leaving in the morning. We'll just have to spend the night here. - What do you mean "we"? - Let me get you a room. I can book my own room, thank you. You're not gonna get anything decent this late. Let me get you a room in the Fraser. It's the least I can do. So, are you getting rooms for all your other passengers? Only for those that don't like me. This guy… Oh, man. So… who broke your heart? Who's the ex-husband? Oh, no. God, no! How about we talk about your wife? What about her? Well, how does she cope with you and other women? It's none of her business. Damn! That's ice-cold. Hey, look. We're getting a divorce. She's taking my daughter back to America. Hmm. Yeah. - For real? - Yep. And here I was thinking you were just being a regular dog. People think what they want to think. - Well, this is true. - Mm-hmm. So if you don't mind me asking, why are you getting a divorce? Long story short, cultural differences. She did seem pretty angry at the wedding, so… Yeah, sad. But it's the best thing for us. So, uh, would you like me to, uh, top that up? -Um, I'm still working on this one so… But in due time. -Hmm. -No, I'm good, thank you! Oh, man. So, you and Uche at the wedding? Well… me and Uche are wedding buddies. That's so funny because that's exactly what she said. And I believe these days, she has lots of wedding buddies. Hey, hey, take it easy now. - That's my girl. - Guilty as charged. You can't say anything bad about Uche. So, I hear you're single. Yes, happily single. I'm so done with men. Ugh. Oh, that's a shame. Why is that? 'Cause nobody in the world is designed to live by themselves. Seriously. Well, if you must know, part of the reason why I'm here is to see an IUI specialist. So I won't be alone. Wow. Oh, my God! I can't believe I actually just said that out loud. -Seriously? What? Does that freak you out? Your body, your choice. Now, that's my song! - What? - Oh, yeah! Hey! Why are you smiling like a cat that got the cream? Well, it's a beautiful day. Oh, please. Okay, well, um, this is my room. So… What? Ouch. I need to take this. - Please. - No problem, go ahead. Hey. I've been trying to reach you all day. Your daughter wanted to speak to you. How's she doing? She misses you. It's my wife. - Right. - Yeah, you know what? Let... Let me call you back. Yes, let... let me call you back, okay? - Guess what? - What? On my trip to Ibadan… - Yes. - …guess who sits beside me. - Who? - Your in-law. - That one? - Yeah, sat right next to me. That couldn't honor my invitation to my gallery opening. - Don't mind him. - Rubbish. Liars like that are the worst. I should have done better and kept him away from you. Femi said he's getting a divorce. Well… Mwah! And I like my men married. -Much less hassle. - Uh... - Can I help you? Nice gallery opening the other night. Thank you. Next time, I'll make sure that my invitation is more exclusive. Please, anyway… Maybe I should open an art gallery. I think you should. Seems easy. All I have to do is lie on my back. Take it easy. Do not give them any… Uche, Uche, just… Just... Just go. Uche, please. Uche! Rise above it. You're better than this. Nonsense! Why isn't this key coming out? Oh. Heavenly Father, -we thank you for bringing us together. Lord, make my daughter fruitful. And please, do not forget to find my first daughter, Uche, a husband. Lord, she needs a husband. Lord, I want my two daughters to give me grandchildren before I die. Please, Jehovah, do this for me. In Jesus' name. Amen. - Amen. - Go on. -Stay away from Uche, she's trouble. Goodnight. Dinner was lovely. Kelechi's told me all about her men. It's all good, bro. I got this. Don't worry. I'm serious. Mummy, leave me alone. -Mummy, goodnight! Leave me alone. -I'm serious. Don't worry. Is that yours? Nice car. The night's still young. Fancy a drink? Let's go. Good. Come on. Femi, goodnight. - Goodnight. - Take it easy. - Love you, bro. - You too. All right, see you later. So I hear you're the top dog. The train consortium and all. Ever thought of investing in art? What do you need me for? I thought you already had an investor. What if I want a different one? What kind of returns are you projecting? What are you looking for? Return on investment? Right now, nothing. Nothing? Oh. -Uh... Okay, I mean, there is potential, grow the market. But right now, it's for the love of art. Now, that is some expensive love. Have you ever thought about going into a business that's a lot easier? Now, that would be the smarter move. All right, so how do I say this for the layman? - Art… - Uh-huh. …is not just the best of us, it is what defines us. It is how we create our culture and translate our experiences across space and time. I like that. Wow. I think I might invest in you. You like art? What if I like you? Oh, God. You say the right things, don't you? Um, I think this is me. My night's over, I've got to go. All right then. Goodnight. Thank you. That's it? "Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am"? You need a bigger car. Okay. Pack this up. Hello. Hello. It's Toyin. Oh. Hi. Were you asleep? I didn't even realize how late it was. No, I was just about to go to bed. Oh, okay. Well, I just wanted to apologize. I missed dinner at Uche's mum's place because of work. Um, maybe I could buy you a drink sometime, apologize properly? Thank you. -You've never had oysters? I've never had them and I never will. Well, today's the day for trying new things. -Hmm. Oh, excuse me. Sorry, I just got a call… Okay. - Is everything okay? - Uh, yeah, it's just work. All right. Okay. - To new things. - To new things. Hmm. -Mm. -I'm sorry, let me just get this. Okay. This is going in the handbag. Thank you. Come on. Bring it here. -Ready? I'm sorry, I can't. -I just… I can't. I can't! - Come on! One more. - Uh-uh. Mm-mm. -I can't! This is where I come to when things get tough and I need to think. This is my spot. I lied to Uche today. Why did you do that? Because… otherwise, I'd be a hypocrite. I'm the one always telling her to find a decent guy who's not married or complicated. And it feels kinda weird. I mean, I know with you and her, it was just a one-off. But still, there's a girl code, so… We haven't done anything. Yet. I know, but I want to. - Think we can take it slow? - Absolutely. Get up. Get up. What are you doing exactly, man? Huh? Like, how much trouble do you want in your life? Bro, I came to your wedding with the best of intention. - Oh? - Whatever happened was out of my control. Really? You know that Uche is my wife's sister. If Kelechi finds out, I'm dead. And you're dead too. Do you want us to be dead? She's not gonna know about that, right? You know women don't know how to keep secrets. - Tell me you haven't slept with them. - No, just Uche. Oh, my God! - Just sex, that's all she wanted. - Really? - And an investment in the gallery. - And Toyin? She's different. You know… She's the marrying type, you know? What? You were talking about getting a divorce. - Now, you're talking about remarrying? - I'm just saying, she's not Uche. Oh, I'm glad you know that because, you know, Uche is… Uche is Uche. Her rules, her life. You know what? I am going to give it to you straight! You, look at me! Look at me! You're always acting as if it's not your fault! Like, "Oh, it's out of my control." "I don't know how these things happen to me." Ever since Mom... Aw, come on, bro! It has nothing to do with Mom. What I'm trying to say is, it's high time you take responsibility for your action. Do the right thing. - Okay? - Okay, all right. Cut it off with the both of them. End it. Okay. I'll end it. - With the both of them. - Promise. I'll do it tonight. "Uche, it's me." "Uche, it's me." "Uche… it's me." Uche. Uche? - Where is the light? - Sit. We need to talk. Talk? We don't, um… Or dance? Uche, we don't have to do this. You are very intelligent. And if this is about the gallery, we can, um, draw up some papers and, um… - You don't find me attractive? - Oh, I do. But, uh, we don't need to do this. You're more than just sex. Let's talk about that. - You mean that? - Yes. This… is not about the investment. This is for me. Uh… Give me a… Shh. Hey, bro. Look, I am tired. Uh, no, I couldn't do it. Listen, man, I'll do this tomorrow, I promise you. Yeah. I'll break up with Toyin tomorrow. I promise. Yeah. I'm... I'm downstairs. Downstairs right now, coming up. All right. -Let me see. All right. - Okay. - Okay, this is really good. - Thank you. - We just need about five copies each. - Okay. - And make them clear. - So there's no issues. - Yes, ma'am. All right, thank you. Goodness. Oh, my God! What are you doing here? You wanna go for a walk? A walk? Uh, okay, just give me one second. Okay? I may not like oysters, but here I am, hanging out with you in the middle of my workday. Hmm! -I'm learning, right? Baby steps. So, by the way, I need to talk to you about something. Thank you for taking it slow the other night. And you know, I've been having doubts about the IUI, so maybe I will wait. I'm sorry, I'm just rambling. What did you want to talk about? Uh, never mind. Forget it. Not important. You know what? I don't have to be back in the office for an hour. Coming? Come here. - Are you all right? - I'm just tired, I don't know. - Eh! Eh, eh, eh. - I'm just tired, please! - Maybe you need some water. - Yes. -The body needs rest. - Uh-huh. I had fun though. - But that was so fun. -I have gossip for you. - Yes. - Really? That's funny 'cause I have gossip for you too. But you first. Spill. I'm seeing someone. Uh-huh. Yeah, it's casual, you know, but… As usual. No, please! -What? This one feels different. It... It feels as though it could be the real thing. - You're serious? - Yes. Who is he? Do I know him? It... It... It's… It... It… I don't want to jinx it, so I'd rather not say until I'm sure it's the thing, the real thing. Okay, fair enough. This, your new man, he isn't married, is he? Huh? Ugh, wow. Go on, give me the gossip now. What's your gossip? Well… I met someone too. What? No way! He must be Mr. Perfect. I have to meet this one. Who is he? Yes. I mean, it's still early stages so, you know… I'm giving you exactly one week, and I meet this guy. One week. -Okay, one week. -But I have to meet your guy too. - Deal? - Uh, yeah. Stay focused, boy. Mind in the game, okay? Remember, no matter what she says to you, just tell her, "Uche, it's over, I'm out." "Uche, it's over, I'm out." There you go. Hey. Thank you. Papa, it's my time of the month. Again? Uche… Oh, hi! Sam, my business partner. - Is that what you call it now? - I don't want to talk about Sam. Well, I see the way he treated you the other night at your gallery. You were there? You deserve a lot more respect than that. Look, I'm not insulting you. I see you. I know what you're worth. What do you see? I see a woman that fights for what she wants. Are you saying something? No, I'm… Look… Relationship is not your thing. You're not cut out like that. Tell me to tell Sam to go. You know what? Ah… If it's to do with the gallery, I write you a check right now. No, forget about that. I don't need you to be perfect, Akin. I think… you're the right guy. Look. I am not that guy. I'm not ready for a relationship. And look, you're amazing and you… - You're perfect... - Fuck off. Fuck off and get out. I'm sorry. The fuck. I didn't even see that coming. I didn't even think she liked me that much. Now, you've got to do Toyin. Fuck that, bro. - What? - That was some brutal shit. - I'm not doing it. - What? Look at me. I guess I just have to ghost her. Do what you have to do. - You're doing the right thing. - Doesn't feel like it, bro. Sorry, I've been busy. You sleep with me, and then all of a sudden, you're too busy? I'm sorry. So, everything you said, the way you were with me, that was all just to fuck? Toyin, look, I can't be in a relationship right now. I'm not in that space. You could have chosen so many different ways to be. But you didn't have to be so cruel. I told you to fix this! I spoke to him. He said he was handling it. What am I supposed to do? - Are you kidding? He's your brother! - I spoke to him! He said he got this. Oh, yes, girl, you are psychic. Hey, babe, I was just about to call you. I swear you're psychic. - What's wrong? - Can you imagine that motherfucker? I swear, I shouldn't have opened up my heart to him. He treated me like a piece of meat! Why don't you come over? We can have a glass of wine and talk about it. You're the best. I love you. - Sure. - Okay. I need to talk to you about the tests. Toyin. I can't believe you're the one who wants to come clubbing now. Well, maybe it's high time I see what I've been missing. Yeah? What do you mean? You know I'm always the sensible, stable one, and… …where has that gotten me? So, let me have some fun. Toyin. Toyin, please come down. I'm dancing! Whoo! Hello, beautiful, how are you doing? Why don't you join the fun... Fuck off. Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Yo. Bro. Can't sleep? Is it, um, them? Yeah. I, um… I don't know how to describe this, but… I have never felt the way I'm feeling right now for anyone. Okay. So, you think you're in love? Yes. Okay. With the both of them, or…? I'm in love with both of them. But one of them, just… can't… can't shake out of my head. Which one? Leave me alone. I want to stay. Okay. You can live, you can have fun, you can do anything you want to do, but not like this. Leave me alone. I want to live. - Just go home. Let me live, Uche! - But not like this, please. We can't fight! Uh... Is that what you want? - Yeah. - Yeah. - This is what you want? Fine, have it! - Go, girl! - Have it your way, then! - You're not needed anymore! - Let's go, boys! - Come on, let's go have fun. Need help. -You've got to tell her, bro. If she finds out that I'm with her… her best friend, then she hates me, and they hate each other… -Mm. I don't know, man. You just… have to find a way to work it out, I guess. You're the man, right? Right? Femi. - Femi. - Yo. Uche just called. - Uche, she just called. - Okay. She... She needs your help. - Me? - Yeah! - What's up? - Toyin, she's in trouble. I don't know. She said something about them being at the club in VI, or somewhere. She was frantic and screaming and crying… She's where? - At a club? - Yeah. She's not safe. She's in there right now with a guy with a checkered shirt and glasses. And then the other guy's got locs and then tattoos all over. Okay. You stay right here. - Where is she? - Who the fuck are you? Let go of me! If you don't want to lose every fuckin' tooth in your mouth, I suggest you better start speaking. - Where is she?! - That chick? I don't know. She freaked out, she just left. She's not answering her phone. What if something has happened to her? Go home, just in case she shows up. -Okay? If anything happens to her, I couldn't live with myself. - Nothing will happen to her. - Get your hands off me! Uche, I need to talk to you. Akin, I don't need to listen to you. I don't need any of your bullshit anymore. My best friend's missing, and that's all that truly matters now! Okay, look… I'm going to do everything I can to find her. Okay? And by the way, the reason we broke up was because I was seeing someone else. Okay. - Fuck! - I'm in love with you. Yes. I am in love with you. Look… you've had a long night. And my job is to make sure Toyin is okay, and I'm going to find her. We'll talk about this tomorrow. Okay? Come on. Take her home. I remember. This is your place. Toyin, let's go home. There's nothing for me there. What are you... What are you talking about? You have a lot going for you. You got a great job, you're about to be a mother. Did you ever even like me? Or was I just a challenge to you? Of course I did! What are you talking about? Look. You'll get over it, I promise you. I'm just a guy. Oh, fuck you! Do you really think this is about you? I'm dying! What are you talking about? Just go away, it's none of your concern. What are you... What are you talking about? I have cancer. Stage 3 cervical cancer. I'm really sorry about tonight. I'll call you tomorrow. Bye. Stage 3 is not a death sentence. Why should I fight it? You know, my mother died of cancer when I was ten. She just gave up. I watched her die. You won't have to watch me. Maybe I'll just go off on the pier one night… you know? You are gonna fight. And why? Why should I? Life has been so cruel. Nothing ever happens for me. Maybe I'm just one of those people that never gets what everyone else gets. I don't get to have a husband. I don't get to have children. I don't get to have a life. - I give up. - No. No, you can't give up. Like you care. You ghosted me. Remember? I'm here for you now. I'm not going anywhere. I'm going to fight with you to the very end, and you are not gonna give up. Akin? My dear God. It's not working. Welcome to Genesis Gallery. - How may I help you? - How much does this go for? You've gone for one of my favorite pieces, Never Give Up. It's an unlimited offer, uh, five million Naira only. Good luck with that. - Uche. - Mm. Busy, as usual? -It's a gallery, not a corner store. I know. This is a hole where I drop my money into every time. Mm? - Uche. - Mm. Stop it! That face again. Hmm? Genesis Gallery. I need to speak to you about Toyin. I don't like being ignored, Uche. -It's important. I'm just a bit busy right now. Can... Can I just call you back? But that thing you said the other night about the relationship and the gallery, did you mean it? - Yes. I love you and want to be with you. - That's all I need to hear. I'll call you right back. Thank you. You seem to have forgotten who I am. No, Sam. I just remembered who I am. What does that mean? See this thing between you and I? It needs readjustment. So now you're negotiating? I like the fact that you're an investor, but it can no longer be quid pro quo. You like for me to pay, but you don't want to play. I don't like your idea of business, Uche. It's the art that truly matters, Sam. Art? Art is all that truly matters… Sam… - Sam. - Do you know what my idea of art is, Uche? Sam… - This is my idea of art! - No, Sam! Sam? Is there another man? There cannot be another man, Uche. You belong to me. I bought you. The flat you live in, my money. The clothes you wear, my money! Your pants, your bra, -everything you wear, my money! What's going on here? Please, come in. You decide. It's either you're in or you're out. And if you're out, you stay out in the street! Like the cheap harlot that you are. And not an expensive one. Bitch, you want my money and everything? My money! Oh, my God. I didn't realize. It's fine. I'm done with him. I have something to tell you. I have something to tell you too. - No. This guy I've been seeing... - Listen, Uche, I have to tell you this. I have cancer. What? - Stage 3, cervical. - Oh, my God! I'll be fine. I'll be fine. -Stop. Stop, it's okay. It's okay. I'm going to stand by you, I'll fight with you. I'll do everything with you. I know. I know you will, and someone else too. It's like we've known each other forever. - He's amazing! - Oh, my God. I've kept it a secret from you, because, well, I wasn't sure where it was headed, and I was also embarrassed. Embarrassed? Why? It's Sunday. I know! Femi's brother, Sunday. I know he's married and all of that, but I just… I don't know, I just feel so... so much love for him. And, I mean, it's not going to be weird for you, is it? I mean, I know what you guys had at the wedding wasn't anything, right? I mean, you said so yourself. So, um… - Mm. - I love him. He's the real deal, honestly. And I... I can tell that it's going to help me get through this. Are you okay? You seem a little pale. It's Sam. - I got to renew. - It's okay. I didn't know. Come here. Come here. It's okay. It is a, uh, possible expansion, but it will mean a capital outlay. That's where we are at the moment. Sunday! Um, sorry, let me take care of this. Just… Excuse me. Excuse me. -Bastard! You fucking bastard! You said you loved me. I tried to explain this to you. Really? You couldn't find anyone in the whole of Nigeria? Anyone in the whole world? My best friend! That was not my intention! Really? You fucking liar! She told me everything. I threw away Sam! I broke it off with Sam for you! I love you! I... I... I love you, but I don't know what to do. -Okay? Now, if you want us to go tell her the truth, we'll do that. - We'll go tell her. - So she will lose the will to live? I fucking hate you. I hate you so much. I fucking hate you. I hate… -…seven, eight, nine. Come on! Eleven, twelve. Come on! Come on! You should be resting. This is a form of rest for me, actually. By the way, thanks for doing this. Pleasure. - Hi. - Hi. Heavenly Father, thank you for this food we're about to receive. Thank you for love, thank you for friendship, and thank you for life. In Jesus' name, amen. Amen. Bon appetit. Uche, tell us about your secret man. Did he ever make a reappearance? Uche was seeing someone, and we were hoping that he would be the one. It never quite worked out. It ended months ago. Don't worry, the right man will come. Might just be Sam. Oh, no, you didn't! What if I did? Uche, you're more than that. Huh? Yes, you are. Right? By the way, I might be able to loan you that money for the gallery. Let him help you. - He doesn't mind. Do you mind? - Not at all. You know what, guys? This is not about me. This is about you. To getting better. To you. Thank you. I'm so sorry I can't walk you to the door. I'm so tired. Never mind. Thank you. Bye. - Bye. - I need to talk to you. I must. Hey. Come on. I get you. Stop. You all right? Yeah, I'm all right. It's… - It's just the usual. - You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Go, go, don't be late. - Call me if you need anything, okay? - I will. Okay. Love you. You too. -Good morning, sir. - Eunice… - Hmm? …I'll take this from here. It's fine. Okay. Hey. I couldn't resist being so close to you last night. Me too. We belong together. But Toyin needs me. She needs you. But I… need you. Tell me you don't want me. The chances of a pregnancy now were small, but miracles happen. So what happens now? It's risky to continue with the treatment and the pregnancy at the same time. It's dangerous for the baby in the first trimester. They should have tested you for pregnancy at the hospital before the therapy began. Yes! Because if they had, I wouldn't have started the treatment. Doctor, I've wanted a child for so long. And it's with a man that I love. I love you. I love you too. This can never happen again. - She needs us. - I know. I'll die for her. I know. I know. No, no. No, no, no. That's not an option. - Can you just listen? - No, this is madness. I'm not continuing with the treatment. That's suicide. No, it's not. Yes, I know, it's stage 3, but I still have a chance to survive. A small chance. Yes! You're the one that told me to take a chance on life, right? So this is it. - This doesn't even make any sense. - I'm pregnant. You're… pregnant? You were right. I just needed to wait for the right man. Are you happy? Yeah. -Good. You have so much more to live for. Yes! I have so much to live for, and I'm not going to jeopardize this baby. I'm not. So please, I know what I'm doing. And as long as God keeps me, I'm going to do everything I can to bring this baby into this world, but I need the will to survive. You both… are the most important people in this world to me. So all I'm doing is asking for your support. Can you do that? I love you. I love you too. All right. Okay. Let's have some dessert, shall we? - How is she doing? - She's good. She's strong. How are you doing? Hey. I've always wanted to try painting, but, um, I couldn't because I was always working. Aw. Is that a bonsai tree? Does this qualify to hang in your gallery? Never to be sold. Only to be treasured. -And that's why you're my friend. -Mm. - She's a healthy little girl. - Oh, thank God! We're having a healthy baby girl! Thank you, Doctor. -Mm. Yeah. All this kicking, now I need to pee. - Can you help me up? - Okay. Yeah. Okay. - Come on. - Ooh. Goodness, it's getting heavy. - Not too long. - Yeah, little more… Okay. -Are you all right? I… I'm fine. - You know what? - What? I've been thinking, we should go on holiday. Okay! Hey, Uche! No, it was actually a really good flight. Yeah! The gallery is closing. I'll be fine. I'm done. Hold on. Hello. - Hello. - I'm Vance Packard. Uche. I represent a client looking to buy some original Nigerian art. How much are we looking at? Budget? 250,000 US dollars. Oh. I guess you've come to the right place then. - I'll take you down to where I have more… - Okay, perfect. …paintings, and then you… You know how she is. She always hides the pain, doesn't want anyone to know. I'm on my way. Mr. Oyeyemi? How is she doing? We have to operate. The baby has to come out. - She only has two months left! - We have no choice. Toyin. Is she here yet? There's not much time left. They need to operate. No! No, she needs to be here. - We need to clear the room, please. - No. No, we can't. She needs to be here, please! She's the most important person in my life. Nurse, just a little while longer. Her... Her best friend's coming from the airport. Please. You're playing with her life. I can't believe you punched him. - Look at my hand. - Oh, sorry. Whoa. -Is this your house? It's so… big. -Isn't your house big? - Good evening, ma'am. - Good evening, Mama. Where were you? Where have you been? And who is this one? Mama, this is Toyin, my new best friend. Get inside right now! Hi. -And you too! Thank you. I'm sorry for being so selfish. I've stolen the last months from your lives together. I saw you that day in the gallery. But I didn't say anything. How could I be unhappy that the two people I love most had found each other? But I guess I wanted to borrow from your happiness, just a little, while I could. I want you to be happy. There's so little I can give you in return, although I hope the money from "Vance Packard" helps. I don't know where I got that name. Never let my memory come between you. You've given me love, courage, and the both of you have given me life. Please, take care of my daughter. Love her like you loved me. Take her on airplanes, teach her to dance and how to eat oysters. Smile when you remember me. And love each other with everything you have.
