Rockwell early on became known for his illustrations of boys, especially boys getting in trouble. They would go swimming in places where they weren't supposed to swim. They would play hooky from school. They would get in trouble. But when Rockwell worked for the Scouts, the boys no longer got in trouble. His Scouts were very obedient. They never misbehaved. You never see Scouts without their shoes. They’re always following the rules. Basically, the Scouts micromanaged him.

In one painting, for instance, Rockwell wanted to paint raindrops on the Scout’s uniform, and the Scouts said, "We can't have a wet uniform."

Brokaw: Tonight, our continued report is on a story that came out of the Boy Scouts of America headquarters earlier this week. Of all things, it involved cheating by Scout officials. Scout membership figures were padded to qualify for additional federal funds. Until the scandal broke, it was not widely known that the Boy Scouts were receiving federal aid, and certainly the idea of cheating was totally inconsistent with the Boy Scout image. So Fred Briggs looked further into the situation. The membership rolls show that Chicago still has the largest single Scout Council in the country. However, critics say those membership rolls tend to lie once in a while, especially when it comes to Scout troops in the inner city. Briggs: This is one example, a housing project on the South Side. In 1971, the books listed 800 boys as members of a Scout troop here. But when meetings were held, as few as 30 showed up. Inner-city Scout groups are subsidized by federal poverty funds. The Chicago Council now admits registration figures were inflated by as much as 40%. We constantly are auditing our membership, trying to watch for membership that is not active, where the leader may have moved out of the community and so on. Briggs: The Chicago Council admitted this week that five staff members have been fired for padding registrations.

In the late 1980s, the Boy Scouts were sued regularly, but the Boy Scouts never went to trial. They always settled. But in this case, they decided to go to trial. The lawyers for Kerry Lewis said, "Hey, we hear there are these files. We want them to be brought into evidence." Janci: There was some information in certain dark, you know, corners that, "Oh, these files may exist." But almost no one had ever been able to obtain the files in litigation, and no one had ever been able to make them public. We knew we had a huge battle on our hands. The Scouts have almost never been willing to turn anything over. ♪♪ Jaquiss: The judge in this case was a very experienced judge. They threw every argument they could think of at this judge, and he wasn't really cowed by that. Of course, the defense objected to the admission of these files into evidence. The Boy Scouts knew they had a problem. Crew: The judge ordered the Boy Scouts to turn over to us 20 years of I. V. files... "perversion files." ♪♪ Less than two weeks before we were supposed to start trial, they finally produced the files. Crew: We got 1,200 I. V. files, the Ineligible Volunteer files. Not all of the I. V. files that the Boy Scouts had, but the ones that the judge deemed relevant. When I realized that he was going to let in 20 years worth of files, I was pretty sure... game over for the Boy Scouts. Janci: There’s not a lot of moments in life where you know that you’re doing something that very few people have ever done before, but we did have that sense when the files got delivered. And when you started to go through these records, you felt the weight of what we were doing. ♪♪ Malarkey: We were in our jury room, and they brought a bunch of those cardboard file boxes. And then the bailiff leaves, and it’s just the jurors. Then we started just opening them and thumbing through them. We all sat, and there was a lot of sitting in silence and reading for a long time. And then we started saying, "Oh, my God." I was trying to just be a good juror and take in the information and not get too carried away emotionally. And then it just, honestly, became horrifying. Because each one of these names was a real person, was a real child, and there was box after box after box. There was just a lot of silence in the jury room in reverence for what those documents held and the actual acts that they represented. ♪♪ I read lots, and I read lots in detail. And knowing that there were thousands more, it was really... Yeah. Uh...disgusting. ♪♪ Janci: One of the documents we found in a number of files was a memo cover page. And the graphic on that memo was a little cartoon picture of a firefighter putting out a fire. And that told us everything we needed to know about the way that they viewed how reports of child sexual abuse should be dealt with. They viewed this as a fire to be put out, a secret to be kept. ♪♪ Crew: It’s right there on the files. They wouldn’t tell the police. They didn’t tell the police. I mean, it wasn't just a practice. It was a policy. It was a written policy. Don’t tell the police. Don’t tell the school that the Scoutmaster works at. Don’t tell anybody. They were as much intent on protecting the confidentiality of the perpetrator as they were of any of the victims. Janci: The Boy Scouts created a program internally that they called "probation." ♪♪ Probation was not ordered by the court or the police. In fact, the police or the courts weren't aware when the Boy Scouts decided to put somebody on "probation." But essentially, probation was they knew about a particular pedophile. They knew that that person had been alleged to have abused kids. And they decided, instead of kicking the person out and instead of warning anybody, they would give him a second chance. Malarkey: What we saw was troop leaders being found to have abused children at one troop and then, you know, here they are popping up a year later at another troop in a different state. And again and again. So it was just really clear physical evidence that they had known for decades and decades that these men were assaulting these boys. ♪♪ On this one level, they did a phenomenal job of tracking them. ♪♪ And then, on the other hand, completely dropped the ball on making sure that they couldn’t and wouldn’t abuse other children in the program. Like, what the hell else would those files be for? ♪♪ Janci: These pedophiles knew the soft spots, the weak points, and the Boy Scouts chose not to do anything about it, and they chose to allow more kids to come in unknowingly into a program that was dangerous. Crew: At the Kerry Lewis trial, I think it’s the first time that a jury was able to see with their own eyes what's in the I. V. files. And the jury verdict spoke volumes. Judge Wittmayer: "We, the jury find our verdict as follows... We assess punitive damages against the Boy Scouts of America. Amount... $18.5 million." And it’s signed today, dated today... [ Down-tempo music plays ] Judge Wittmayer: Almost nothing that happens in a courtroom in Oregon is confidential. and if you want to maintain confidences, you settle the case. Jaquiss: It was a huge mistake by the Scouts to go to trial because after the verdicts, The New York Times, The Oregonian, and The Associated Press, who had all petitioned to make the documents public, began putting these files up on their websites. Janci: When you can hold the document that shows that the Scoutmaster that abused me wasn't just a bad apple, this wasn't a one-off, this wasn't unavoidable, this was a pattern and a systemic problem. And they documented the problem, file after file, week after week, year after year for decades. Dr. Warren: We could see people living normal lives. And this was not a static location, but it was a porous, interactive reality. I realized that this was going to be the largest database of community-dwelling child molesters. For victims to be able to go on their own and look at the documents that were obtained and released in the Kerry Lewis case, it was a tipping point. Newscaster: Boy Scout president Wayne Perry apologized to the victims but made no apologies for keeping the files. Our ineligible volunteer file is a big element of our keeping track and making sure that nobody gets in. People should be happy we have these files. You want us to keep these files. Ron: It was pretty easy to find. I had to go through the names, and there it was, Edward Rodriguez... Edward A. Rodriguez, Brooklyn, New York. And I said, "I think this is the guy." Okay. Okay. This is a letter from July 24, 1964. "Dear Howard, Reverend Blank of the Holy Trinity Episcopal Church has requested that we place Mr. Rodriguez on the confidential file. Through personal admission, Mr. Rodriguez has had immoral relations with at least three boys in Troop 739. These incidents occurred more than once, and in the case of the blank boy, over a long period of time. There does not seem to be any doubt as to the validity of these charges." This is July 28, 1964. "Dear Mr. Wallace, this letter is to inform you that the Committee of Troop 739, Manhattan, has asked for and received the resignation of its Scoutmaster, Edward A. Rodriguez. It was requested as a safeguard for the boys in our troop on the grounds of moral turpitude. He didn’t give any reason why he had chosen those boys in particular. But as a matter of fact, these boys are small in stature. Ed Rodriguez also indicated that this is the first time that this had happened. But those present were of the opinion that his actions definitely were repeated previously with others. Before ending, though, he was requested not to divulge any information connected with the affair, and we have even gone so far as to concoct a reason why Ed Rodriguez has left the troop." Okay. Well, come on. It’s a bunch of bullshit. You’re admitting to me that you concocted a story for him to resign, and this is some letting him off the fucking hook? Excuse my language. But I definitely don’t mind it being taped. Sorry. This is just bullshit. It’s just reading bullshit. And for someone to actually sign their name to it, what an asshole this person is. Let’s put this guy in jail. Forget about Eddie Rodriguez. They’re all bad guys. You’re such a good guy. Come here. Stewart: When I first was thinking about joining the Boy Scouts, I went to a pastor friend of mine in Dallas for some counsel. He said, "What’s your biggest fear about joining?" I said, "Honestly, if I join the Boy Scouts, they can't compensate me the same way I’m being compensated"... That was my belief. He goes, "What are you talking about? The guy across the street works for the Boy Scouts. He’s got a limo that picks him up every week." And he said, "And that guy drives a company car down to get his trash each day." Hi. My brother is an Eagle Scout, but earning that rank was not ever on my radar. I went into Scouting because I love to camp and I love to hike and I love to do adventures and have a great time with other people. And that’s what I did. Oh, you’ll love this. These are my saddles. All my cowboy gear is really done in honor to my love for Scouting. You’ll see that my colors are typically olive, like the uniform, and tan. I also had some silver conchos made that has the Fleur de lis, which is the emblem for the millions and millions of Scouts around the world. One thing about Scouting, once you’re in, you don’t leave if you love Scouting. I started out as a Scout. Once my kids became Scout age, I was their Cubmaster. Now I’m the father of two Eagle Scouts. I mean, Scouting is all about giving back. Scouting is about helping the next generation. I would have thought nobody joins Scouting to make a lot of money. What’s funny about that is you look at some of the salaries of the senior executives over the years, and you see this absolutely absurd high salary for a senior executive. There have been a number of people who I think came to the Boy Scouts of America to take advantage of the Boy Scouts of America. I joined as a consultant in 2010, and then I resigned in 2019. When I joined the National Council, there were people who had worked at BSA National for 20 and 30 years. They were very safe in their job, very safe in their retirement program, and the lease cars were just part of the entitlement. But if you ask, "Who is responsible for the decline over the years?" nobody took ownership for it. I mean, if you’re going out of business, you’re not leaving at 4:30 in the afternoon. You’re staying until 10:00 at night, 11:00 at night. You’re there first thing in the morning. But if you were at the national office at 4:30 in the afternoon, you better watch out, because you’re about to get run over by a stampede leaving the office. Morones: I was asked to analyze the Boy Scouts´ public financial information. And I have to say, I was surprised by the size and scope of the organization financially. The assets were over a billion dollars, and I had no idea. That’s large for a nonprofit. [ Mid-tempo music plays ] Since the 2010 trial, the Boy Scouts has generated a substantial operating loss every year. I added up a loss of over $500 million. Their legal fees have substantially increased during that time. Membership has been declining, and it appears to be getting worse. Still, in 2019, the Boy Scout top executive makes over a million dollars a year, higher than any other CEO in that category of nonprofits. And the organization has promised to pay certain amounts of money to executives in their retirement years. It’s risky because the pension payments are promised regardless of economic conditions. So to have that coincide with taking on additional debt... extremely unfortunate timing. I can't really speculate any intention beyond that. Jaquiss: Absolutely. Lord: You can die without being killed, because some of those experiences I had when I was being abused, I felt like I was dying, or maybe death was the answer. So I had died many times, but I had to wake up in the morning and face another day. [ Down-tempo music plays ] And not only did he abuse me, but Lonnie introduced me to other Scout leaders, and he introduced me to a Scout executive from New York Council named Gary Rivers. And Gary was, like, in his 20s, just graduated from college, and he was an executive in finance. I looked up to him, and so I said, "Here’s a guy who is a Black, African-American male leader." And so I got introduced to him, and then, that turned out to... he wanted more than just me looking up to him as a leader, that Lonnie Barnes introduced him, and... and so Gary abused me, too. And... And Gary's story... I guess I’m almost 16 when I... when I meet Gary. And, uh... Wow. So I had to call Gary one day... ...and tell him that I had gonorrhea. And... And that was... I didn’t know what gonorrhea was. I was in pain, and I called him. And he told me, you know, to meet him in New York City. And I’m in New Rochelle. And I had to get on a train by myself. I couldn’t tell anybody what was going on. And I was fearful of what... ´cause I’m in pain, what's going to happen. So I met him at Grand Central Station, and we went to a doctor. And Gary was talking to the doctor, and then, all of a sudden, I get called into this room. I’m given a shot. ♪♪ He introduced me to a lot of bad people. You know, I had to perform or whatever.

First, listen to this letter the Boy Scouts of America wrote to us. It says, "The Boy Scouts has been the catalyst for much of the awareness and discussion of child abuse that has emerged in recent years." Sawyer: Your critics say, to put it bluntly, that you were dragged kicking and screaming into dealing with the child abuse problem and that what you wanted to do, until you were forced to do it, was just hush it up. There are people that want a silver-bullet answer to everything, and we’re not gonna please people who expect an absolute silver- bullet solution to this problem. Were there no significant problems inside the Boy Scouts before 1985? Not that we’re aware of, no. None at all? Not that we’re aware of. Sawyer: Day one’s review of hundreds of Boy Scout files shows an average of 99 reports of child abuse in the organization every year. Isn’t that a problem? 99 out of 6, 7, 800 local councils. I don’t think that you can say that’s a problem. You can't say that’s a problem? Again, one case is one too many. Well, then you've got almost 100 on average a year. That’s 100 times worse problem. And you work forward developing and enhancing programs as you go.

Jaquiss: Beginning in the late ’80s, the Boy Scouts put in place what they call the youth protection protocols. Jaquiss: These were new policies designed to train adult leaders and establish new guidelines. Narrator: One-on-one activities between adults and Scouts are not authorized. Jaquiss: They advertised to the public aggressively that they were making Scouting safer. Narrator: Any time that you suspect child abuse in the Boy Scout program, you must contact the Scout executive. The Scout executive in each council has contact with the proper authorities and has established procedures. Rep. Don Edwards: The purpose of this subcommittee meeting today is to establish procedures for national criminal background checks for child care providers. Nemecek: Let me first state unequivocally that the administration strongly supports the goals of this act. Swann: We require a criminal background check of all potential volunteers. We have endured the cost and the burden of getting this done. Rep. Don Edwards: Well, thank you, Mr. Swann. We’re pleased to have the support of your great organization. We'll now hear from Lawrence F. Potts, director of administration for Boy Scouts of America. Mr. Potts. While we applaud your efforts to attack a very serious societal problem, it is undoubtedly true that many worthy volunteers would simply not wish to subject themselves to being fingerprinted. To combat child abuse, BSA, with the help of experts, has designed a special five-point plan. Rep. Pat Schroeder: So you'd like to have a profile of what you think is a trustworthy volunteer? That has worked for you and has not caused any problems? I mean, you can figure this out without any help. Unfortunately, experts have told us that there is no profile. There is no way in advance that you can you can be assured... Rep. Pat Schroeder That’s what they told us, too. That’s why I thought maybe you had found the key to unlocking all of this. Potts: We know the leaders that we’re selecting. You know, they come out of the community, would be known in the community, would have roots in the community, would be married, would be fathers of kids in the program. Roberts: A former executive with the Boy Scouts has pleaded guilty to child pornography charges. Douglas Smith worked with the Scouts for nearly 40 years, even ran a task force to protect kids from sexual abuse. Smith now faces up to 20 years in prison. Lawyer: Which criminal statute were you convicted of? I was convicted of receipt and distribution of child pornography. Lawyer: Did you ever hold a position at the Boy Scouts of America with respect to the Youth Protection guidelines? Yes, sir. Lawyer: What were the circumstances under which you ceased working for the BSA? Um...I, uh... I submitted my letter of retirement after the police had come to my house. Lawyer: Are you presently employed in any capacity whatsoever by the Boy Scouts of America? No, sir. Lawyer: Okay. What is your current state of employment status with the Boy Scouts of America? Retired. Lawyer: And so when you are completing your term of incarceration, you will be then eligible to receive medical benefits and you will also receive your retirement? Is that correct? Yes. Lawyer: I believe that is it for me, sir. Um, at this point, I have no further questions. [ Down-tempo music plays ] Jaquiss: For decades, all the letters sent to the Boy Scouts alleging sexual abuse in Scouting were sent to a man named Paul Ernst. He was the keeper of the secrets.

Yes, that’s true. ♪♪ Lawyer: And you didn’t share it with other parents in the troop? No. Lawyer: Okay. But... As I was saying, you don’t give it out to the public.

"Dear Mr. Dale, the grounds for your membership revocation are the standards for leadership established by the Boy Scouts of America, which specifically forbid membership to homosexuals." [ Down-tempo music plays ] I was in the Scouts from the age of 8 to the age of 20. I was in it my entire childhood. It was the singular, most formative part of my youth. I was not out when I was younger. And even if in the back of my mind as a gay kid, I had that doubt or fear or, you know, self-hatred, you could even say, the Boy Scouts really helped me not feel so bad about myself as a gay kid, even if I didn’t have the words at the time. I was really caught off guard, but it wasn't something I could also walk away from. I’m really happy with who I am today, and I’m really happy with where I’ve come and what I’ve stood for. All that is because of the Boy Scouts. It’s a great program with a policy that’s just simply wrong and harmful. Jaquiss: James Dale sued the Scouts and ended up going all the way to the United States Supreme Court. And even though their membership was in long-term decline, they spent millions of dollars just fighting to keep him out. Cooper: On a divisive issue, the Supreme Court ruled that the Boy Scouts can bar homosexuals from serving as troop leaders. ♪♪ Dale: The saddest irony in all of this is that you’re taught to be honest, to be trustworthy, to be a leader. Everything I’m doing now is because of what the Boy Scouts taught me. If we no longer in America can discriminate on the basis of what we believe, then we are no longer a free people. Jaquiss: For Scouting, it seemed to be more important to exclude gay Scouts and Scout leaders than it was to fix the pedophile problem. The Boy Scouts knew they were harboring pedophiles and they didn’t do anything about it. My name is Michael Johnson. I’m a father, a son, and former director of youth protection with the Boy Scouts of America. And truth be told, I have got to share something that’s been on my heart and a major concern of mine in my final years at the Boy Scouts of America as well as after my departure, and is more clearly true. When I ask the question, "Is the Boy Scouts of America safe for kids?" the truth of the matter and the truth that I said at the time was, "It’s not. The Boy Scouts of America is not safe for kids."

Jaquiss: People said, "Hey, the Scouts pay their executives very generously, even though we’ve seen since 2010 basically an annual operating deficit or loss each year." Yeah, our compensation committee looks every year at the compensation of our executives, actually does market assessments, and is quite confident that they’re being appropriately compensated for the complexity of their responsibility compared to other youth-serving organizations. And so we feel very positive about that. Jaquiss: So, how is it gonna be different when you come out of Chapter 11? How is it culturally and operationally gonna be different? I think the cultural changes around youth protection have already been made. We’re not going to be more focused on this because of going through bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is a process to compensate victims. It’s not a process of changing the characteristic of Scouting.

But, you know, I heard stories that they had an associate Scoutmaster in his troop in the ’70s in Dallas that, you know, had relationships with youth that just weren't proper. ♪♪ My brother was an all-state football player and, you know, big guy. And I remember him telling me the story about his Scoutmaster coming in to his tent one night and he just basically said, you know, "Get off me," and, you know, "I don’t want you to do that." Kind of like, you know, bullied him in a way to, you know, get him off. And that was kind of... It was funny ´cause that was always in my mind. And then we moved here in eighth grade, and Camp Kikthawenund up the road, I had an experience where... It’s funny, ´cause I can still smell him. I can still think about his image and who that person was at that point in time. An adult volunteer, you know, did a very similar thing to me. And unlike my brother, I didn’t necessarily have the strength or the ability as an eighth grader to, you know, kind of just push him off and say, you know, "Stop. What are you doing?" You know, I stopped participating in Scouting every single week and things of that nature. I know it stopped me from going to certain events, and I never told my parents what happened. I assumed they knew. But thankfully, my father kept pushing forward. I mean, I’m glad that Scouting was not ripped away from me because of my own experience. That individual, you know, doesn't represent Scouting to me. When you start hearing that people at 52 years of age, that was the average age that most men who have been abused will come to terms with that, and I was right around 50 years of age. So when I say that Scouting prepares you for life, I think the silver lining in all of this is, yeah, I was abused, but I also was able to receive healing through that. I was also, you know, available to understand the victims and what they’re going through right now, anxiety and depression and suicide. I know those feelings. ♪♪ Our courts are going to figure this out... you know, how to fairly compensate the victims. The Scouts are going to end up paying, you know, billions of dollars to settle these claims. And they’re gonna have to sell properties. They’re gonna have to liquidate things like the Norman Rockwell collection, whatever those things are. But I’m confident Scouting will survive. I’m hopeful Scouting will survive. [ Voice breaking ] Sorry. ♪♪ Crew: I’m grateful for the survivors that trust us with their stories, their unbelievably heartbreaking stories. I can't tell you how many have told me how... they kind of divide their life between before the abuse and after the abuse and how it changed and how everything changed at that moment in their life and how so many of them are haunted by... They’re haunted by who they would have become if this never happened to them. [ Down-tempo music plays ] ♪♪ Turley: I think it’s my opportunity and obligation to help make sure that Scouting is the safest place for youth. ♪♪ I feel that is the place today. We are incredibly safe. I am so sorry for what happened decades ago, but I feel so good about where we are today and I know how committed the organization is to even continuing to improve from here. Jaquiss: And I remember the Scout law that I learned, you know, 45 years ago. It changed my life in many ways for the better. But I wonder how you weigh this. So the benefit that you and I got and millions of other people got from Scouting and the devastation that it has wrought on a significant number of men, the good that it did and the damage it did. I’m glad these 82,000 came forward. I’m glad we’re at a point in time in our society where people will talk about abuse. 50 years ago, people didn’t talk about abuse very often. It was taboo. And so I actually look at the opportunities to make places better. Jaquiss: Reporters are all about hindsight. In hindsight, do you wish that, from a sort of financial structure point of view, that you had declared bankruptcy earlier, or did you do it the right time? You know, reporters might be all around hindsight, but I’m not, you know? So I like to live my life out the windshield, not the rearview mirror. [ Down-tempo music plays ] ♪♪ Jaquiss: Before I was a reporter, I was a commodity trader. And if you buy a cargo full of, say, wheat, most of it’s gonna be good. But some of the wheat’s gonna be bad.

Some people have the fortitude to power through, and some don’t. And it’s not strength or weakness. That’s the way abuse is.
