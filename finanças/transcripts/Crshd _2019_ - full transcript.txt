Honestly, you're- - At work, chill 'till two, come hang before lunch. Dope, see you in an hour or so, Anuka? Yay, heart emoji. It's brewed so much that I just like, I don't know, I just randomly made them one night when I was really drunk. Zero percent chance of me losing my virginity tonight, thumbs down emoji, eggplant emoji. We made a pact, it's our last night. We have to hold each other accountable. Just don't forget, you're the only one who knows. DWAI, babe, you're secret is safe with me. Kissy face emoji. Mark, 22, this could be us. Jason, 24, TTF only. Alexander, 27, I'm a real catch. Albert. Georgie. 22, I'm cooking pasta and we can watch a movie with my cat, Snickers. - Hey. - Shit, sorry. I must have scared you. No, I, just didn't see you. Sorry about that. So are you ready for the astro test? Uh. - I'm really not sure either. - Yeah. I'm kind of nervous though. Yeah, I'm getting tense as well. But you know, that's my demeanor, is always tense. I don't really know how to react. I totally get it though, it's like crazy freshman year. Like, I stay up so late sometime and, there are regrets. I feel like I barely got to like open up actually to anyone. Like see the real me. That's a totally different story. Anyway, have you heard about that party happening tonight? - Yeah. - Hi! - Wait for me? - I wanna take a shower. No, just one minute. - Okay, cool, see ya. - Bye. Who's that? I don't know, he's in my astro class. Look who it is. Izz, getting down to biz, all sweaty and shiz. Deb, this is my friend, Izz. - Hi Izz, nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. You doing anything interesting this summer? I'm gonna spend the summer with my grandparents outside Chicago. I'm trying to pass my drivers' test finally. You know what they say? Every time you get in a car, you put your seatbelt on and every time you have sex, - you use a condom. - Really, mom? Like right now? - She's a sex educator. - Thanks. Well, time to get this road on the show JuJu. Bye. Drive safe my Indian princess. He's still saying that? Izzy, look at these notes. You're totally ready for your final. It was so easy for me in high school but this class is killing me. Can we just have fun tonight? I'll have fun when I get to Chicago. Izzy. You look fine. It's just a black t-shirt. Excuse me, these shoes smell like piss. Um, that's how they all smell, so. I'm not putting those on my feet. Yeah okay, well then you can't bowl, so. Can you just not do that? We have a very particular way about cleaning about them, so, that's my job. Well it seems like a bad way. Because it still smells like puke. Cool. Yeah, if you don't put these on, you can't bowl. Okay, you can't bowl in your socks. Why do all the pretty girls also have to be talented? So much more fair if they all sucked. Okay, you're acting like you're not pretty and talented. I mean like your hair's doing like a funny little thing today but. Have you seen her Instagram? Lisa's so hot. Nolan is so hot. They're both pretentious. Come see my lovely art at #crushparty tonight. What's a crush party? I don't know. Be right back. - Hey, hi. - Hey. - Hey. - Hey. Why is everyone so obsessed with her? Her art isn't even good. I like her art. It's cute. I don't want my art to be cute. Yeah, your art isn't cute. I was just looking at your Instagram. Hmm hmm. And I was just wondering what a crush party is. Oh, a crush party is, are you a freshman? Hmm hmm. I mean look at her shoes. She had to paint these as well? I don't get it. No one's even gonna be there, everyone's left for the summer. Yeah, that's why everyone's gonan be there specially to bone. Isn't that like every party? Also, who says bone? Uh, I say bone, boning is hot. It sounds like ET, bone home or throw a dog a bone. No, it's like come on bone me baby or like come on, just a quick little bone before this party tonight. It sounds awful. Hey, you're like a monk with a vagina. That's a nun. I haven't even started studying. We made a pact. Fiona, if I do not pass this test, I'm literally dead and will lose my scholarship. - Wait, what pack? - Okay. You're gonna be stuck with your grandparents all summer. Um, eating oatmeal and playing like badminton and massaging their dog when she's constipated, okay. You need to be freaking DM on getting some dick right now. Oh she'll do the guy she did last summer. What's his name? Travis. Oh Travis, who is Travis. Never mind. - If I submit my crush's name. - Hmm hmm. They get a specific invitation. Yes. And if someone crushes me, I also get an invite. Crush party. There was a dog trapped inside a sewage plant. It's unclear how he ended up there. But everything turned out okay. He's back home safe with his owners eating a big bowl of kibble. Thank you Jeff, in other news, Huntington Center is hosting the Midwest succulent convention today. Hi. Admission is free for children under 12... You need to friend him on Facebook and then deep like one of his photos. Deep what? It's like, you go way back into their photos and then like one. So that it sends them a signal that you're stalking them and that you're interested in them. I couldn't find the one on Facebook. I'll try to find tagged photos of him. My profile reads apathetic with a touch of fuck boy. It's clear that I took time to curate my page but not that much time. I love internet art and I have a tattoo of my childhood stuffed animal on my bicep so I have no pictures of no one here. I sort of forget to update my profile picture. It's been the same for like two years and I'm fairly hot but I don't really like to show it off. But no picture with Nolan, sorry. What about that guy? I haven't changed my profile picture since 2007. I only use Facebook to follow banned pictures. I don't have Facebook so technically I don't exist. No, whatever. And I think he's dating Elise. Elise is gay, like gay gay, not bi. Because in one of our class, she brought in all these paintings of all the vaginas of all her exes and then she talked about all the breakups like every story, so. She's gay. What about that guy? No. I'mma gonna get some cereal. Okay. Elise, 22. Let's get naked and paint each other's bodies. Hey Elise. Yo, what's up girlfriend, no. Question about the crushed party, eh. It's at Big Blue. Just go there and ask for Stephanie. She's like tall and stunning and really hip and friendly. Just tell her you wanna submit in a crush. - Cool. - Definitely go. - It'll be so fun. - Okay. See ya there. We're both getting action, we're both getting action. Shh, shh. You're always so loud. I prefer enthusiastic. Isabel. We made a pinky promise, a pact, you and I. I'm going to make out with Elise. You are going to find someone and bone them and pop that sweet, sweet, cute little cherry of yours. Shh. You just have to um, channel your secret, inner female goddess and have eye sex with everyone on the dance floor. Super simple. Eye sex, hmm hmm. You just find someone in this party and then you lock eye, like this. Yeah, okay, try it, try it with me. Okay, hmm, hold eye contact. Okay, a little less diarrhea. Okay, okay, let's stop. Um, we're just gonna get your very drunk, okay? I'm Sexy Rexy, AKA Mean Profit, AKA Young Jump Start. I love bowls of spaghetti, my pod collection, Naruto fan fiction and dad bods. I could be your devil or your angle. Hope I made you turtle. You really want that cereal? It sticks together when it's stale so. You can just take some from the top. But punching it might be more fun. Genius, thank you. No problem. I'm always like struggling to get it open like... I'll give them back tomorrow. Izzy, you... Do you have an early flight tomorrow? - Hmm hmm. - Hmm hmm, so. - Early morning. - Right, yeah. We probably shouldn't go out then. See, you gotta stop doing that. You don't want to be hung over tomorrow. - You are... - Can we call it? I have to go back to work. Someone took shoes, I don't know. That means you have to go to Big Blue, okay. You need to submit Nolan. I'm gonna submit Elise, okay. It's two blocks down the road, just go. There should be a box. Find the box, if there's not a box, knock and ask for Stephanie. Apparently, she's really hot. Izzy, I know where we're going. It's that way. - It's that's way! - Eh, no. Where are we? I think this way. That way. Are you sure? This has to be it. Oh my God, it smells like weed. Yo, what's up ladies? Or should I say girls? Or should I say women? Is Stephanie here? Stephanie is ocucpano, if you know what I mean. We're here to submit our crushes for the party tonight. Party? The crush party, it's happening here tonight? We sell great parties. You ladies wanna smoke? No, we're here to submit our crush's name in a box to make sure that they're invited to the party and to let them know that someone else in the party is interested in them romantically. What about Tinder? K, K? I matched with him on Tinder. What? I couldn't find a pen but if you write down your crushes, I'll make sure they get to Stephanie. In that? Anuka, are you submitting someone? Yeah, just for fun. Do not tell me this is my Phineas and Ferb DVD. It is. For six months, I've been looking for this. Please put it somewhere safe. And then Fifi, hand me the tens. We gotta do a count on that too. Thank you. Oh boy, that is heavy, God! Hand me the fourteens. - You kids lack mortals. - Hmm hmm. You have no scruples, at all. Hmm hmm. Bowlers, we gotta keep our minds out of the gutters. The red tape doesn't belong in here. Where's the, where's the... - I... - Oh here. Take that. And take these. We gotta kid coming in. Competitive, he's good. Are we really gonna close College Lanes because of a stolen pair of shoes? We can't close College Lanes, okay. I hated being a barista. I hated it Tony. I hated it. See, where's that passion been? You're over here, a kid tipping balls and then you're hopping on the oil pushers. What? The thing that cleans the lanes. Oh. I know it's fun, it's like a Zamboni, but seriously. Look at that. My grandma painted that by hand. - We said, grandma, why? - Why? Why by hand, we'll do it, we'll get decals, whatever. She said, un uh, I'm gonna do it. We said, it doesn't match. Brown and yellow, it doesn't match. No. Said, I wanna do it in neon. That's become the fabric of this whole place, you see what I'm saying? I do. It's all cobbled together with people like us, but these, the shoes, they keep it going. - Repeat after me. - Okay. - We. - We. - Won't. - Won't. - Lose. - Lose. - Slow down. - Sorry. - Any more. - Any more. - Shoes. - Shoes, I will find them. - Go find the shoes. - Okay. Uh hey, are you gonan be studying all night, tonight? She's on no astro diet. No more studying. Not totally no more studying. So are you gonna be going to any parties, tonight, maybe? The crush party. - At Big Blue. - Cool. Cool, yeah, me too, actually. Cool. I don't usually go to parties. I usually stay in with Paul and we watch videos. Yeah, I... Yeah, just these sort of like sort of Russian motorcycle accident videos. There's like no road laws there. Phew! Yeah, they're actually pretty exhilarating. Cool. I'll see you there, then. Yeah, no, I'll probably see you later. You don't wanna get with this guy! He's gross! Stop. Dude, gross is in. - Really? - Yeah. That boy is totally into you. You should flirt with him. He's awkward. And his friend literally just said he's gross. They're just messing with you. Here. They took my gin. I didn't know they were allowed to open the cabinets or anything. Would you have sex with all these old people, staring at you? They're not old people. Do you even know who Vera Cooper Rubin is? Literally, no one cares. She discovered dark matter. How many people do you think had sex on your mattress? I can't do to this party sober and we have five hours to get alcohol and get drunk and my mom thinks I'm 12 years old and sent me a single lollipop in a box covered in hearts. You're freaking kidding me. Fiona, they took my gin in room inspections. We're gonna go get beer or something at the gas station, ugh. Crying emoji. Dude, that's so much alcohol. Dude, shh, come on. Hi boys. Hi. You don't have alcohol, do you? Will Lee? Yeah, Willy. It says this time that you're from uh, Dicksville, Arkansas. Yeah, yeah, Dicksville, yeah. Well, you have a good time in Dicksville, okay. - Yeah, man. - Not bad though. - Respect, my dude. - Yeah. $8.50. Take care, yeah. Next. - Just the ramens for ya? - Yeah, just the ramen. Are you sure you don't want a smell my nuts flavored candle? No. Where you from? - India. - India, okay. Is it hot in India? 'Cause I like it hot. Yeah. What about you, young lady? This is all? You have an ID? So how is the weather in um, in Apalachocola? Nice, warmish. Warmish? Okay. I don't think so my lady. But I could give you one of those smell my nuts flavored candles. That was ridiculous. You're lucky that he gave you your ID back. Fiona isn't even answering. Dear Isabelle, I will be in my office until nine this evening. Please come by with questions and to review the materials. You need at least 71% on this test to pass the class. I don't wanna see you fail. And I highly suggest that you come by to see me. I have some of Julius' weed. You know weed gives me horrible panic attacks. I should just go see my professor. Oh my God. Congratulations, hot stuff. You've been crushed. Somebody crushed me. Who do you think crushed me? Tonight you get to chase your crush. Wear pink and red and show up at Big Blue by 11:00 p.m. to get a heart. Only people who've been crushed are allowed in. See you then sexy. Winky face, smiley, Stephanie. That guy is peeing on that car. You are a sex goddess. Come to the party tonight. You won't regret it. Don't you wanna succeed? You don't wanna end your freshman year still a virgin, do you? This is your future Isabelle. Ah, this is some legit kinky stuff. Oh my God. You should not put those on. Oh my God, just feeling them makes you so nice. It's like very sexual Jared. Kind of like it too much. Like very into this. Ah. Fiona, answer your phone. I just got crushed. Dispatch, put me on with George George Victor, 1133. I let you borrow mom's car and this is what you do? I thougth you were gonna take pop pop to the Midwest succulent convention. I'm really sorry officer, you know, I just thought these were like kinky handcuffs, like for sex not for jail. And I... Sorry. Okay. Thank you. J, when you're behind the wheel, you need to be aware of everything around you. We're all fishes. You need to watch out for all of them around you. Dad! No, you're gonna let me finish. Don't move, I'll be right there. Hello, I found alcohol ladies, let's go shall we? Fiona, who are these children and where are they taking us? Izzy, don't worry about it. If we die tonight, it's on you. All right, just a little bit further. Where are we going? Oh wow. Yeah. I hated high school, you know. Everyone thought I was a middle schooler, 'cause I had my braces on still. It's a hard time. Well, don't worry... In the beginning, about 13 billion years ago, all the space, matter and energy of the known universe was contained in the volume of a single pinpoint. The diversity of life on Earth. Don't you want to succeed. Lose your virginity another time. This is your future, Isabelle. Izzy, you'll do fine. I should have gone to see my professor. Well, maybe you're not the next Carl Sagan. - Sagan. - Sagan. You're Izzy Alden. You're smart, committed. And you'll do fine, even if you study all night tonight or not. Let's play, never have I ever. If you've done it, you drink. Never have I ever been in a threesome. Oh. Bullshit, Emerson. You don't know my life Jared. Two boys or two girls? - Both. - Oh. Even though you don't see it or feel it, touch it or taste it, smell it or even sense it, does not mean it does not exist. Part of why we have science at all is to decode that which is true in nature that otherwise transcends our sensory perceptions. - Fiona! - Fiona! Yes. - Let's go. - Okay, okay. - Oh Izzy. - I'll be your driver. Izzy, you're a terrible driver. You don't have a license. You're all too drunk. You will not be a statistic. What you doing? She's grounding herself. Just feel the wheel on your sexy little fingertips, okay. You're ready for takeoff. You're like a sexy car astronaut. Come Izzy, floor it. We gotta get you on the way to boneville. Bone, bone, boneville! - Boneville, bone... - Would you stop? Um, just go a little faster. Okay, so we get back, get changed and go to Big Blue. Just focus on the road Izzy. Can you tell me who it's from? Your mom just texted. She said, Izz, did you get my package? Just a little end of the year celebration. She sent a photo of herself with, a joint? Okay, your mom is hot. Is that all she said? My dad got a thing for her. Who? Shit. Oh, it's my dad again. Who's that? Oh my God, no, no, no, no, no. J, what in the hell is she doing driving mom's car? You lose soda pop privileges for two weeks. That's not fair, dad you can't even pull people over. You see this badge Jared? If you're being a safety threat, which this young lady, going 15 in a 35, I most certainly can. Sorry officer. Can I see some ID please? You're not a cop. Apalachocola? We've got cousins there. Ah, yeah. Nice weather. I gotta make it down there sometime. J, put gas in the car. Ah, I just feel so good right now. So that was my gin they were drinking. I gotta shower. Okay, I'm gonna go change and I'll meet you in the playground. They faked the room inspections. All that alcohol you were drinking, was stolen. Um, and Elise's boots? I'll give them back. Ah huh. Nolan Wiles, hmm. I have a lot of pictures of me smiling. But taken with cool film cameras. It's a good combination of hip, but approachable. I have a big trust fund but my most expensive item of clothing? $30. I also do a lot of promotion for my band page. I just added him for you. You love pretentious boys. Does my make up look okay? No, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait. You deep like when he accepts, okay? Oh my God. His band is called Cut Loose. ♪ You could say oh my God, your lips are too soft ♪ ♪ What is too soft, ♪ ♪ Nothing's ever too soft ♪ ♪ Want you to pick my brain and my subconscious ♪ ♪ With me you don't have to feel self-conscious ♪ ♪ You look so pretty when you're sad ♪ ♪ Wanna give you little cuddles on my bean bag ♪ ♪ On my bean bag ♪ ♪ You don't have to feel sad ♪ ♪ On my bean bag ♪ It said to wear pink and red. ♪ You don't have to feel sad ♪ ♪ Then we got to your... ♪ Wait. Here, wear these. But, you know I'm not like into big jewelry and stuff. Just wear them. They're for good luck. They were a part of my great grandmother's dowry. And you know the rubies, they came from the red cells of her mother's father's. It's like my great grandparents soul is preserved in these, soon to be followed by my grandparents and my parents and then me. Is that an Indian tradition, trapping your ancestor's in jewelry? Just wear them. I wore them when I took my SAT's and I got 2360. Here. Nana Deelep. And Nani Meena. Will guide you tonight. Okay, let's go. Will you ever get a bag? One sec, I forgot something. Tell Fiona that we're heading out. Hey, you still coming tonight? Yeah! Izzy matched with JuJu? Last night was fun. Wanna hang again? Okay, I'm ready. Is Fiona meeting us there? I bet she's already at Big Blue and making out with Elise on the dance floor. You coming? Yeah. You okay? Yeah. Take your phone back. - Just wait. - Okay. Make sure that I don't chicken out, okay. Who do you think crushed me? Do you think Nolan crushed me? Oh my God, if Nolan crushed me, my heart is going to explode. - God, I'm so nervous. - Hmm hmm. This isn't even the right place. No shit. They're gonna stop letting people into the crush party in 12 minutes. Of course, they only had to say Big Blue. That's not even an address. Does anyone here feel that we're a part of a big joke? Izzy, it's not a great disappointment. Everything happens for a reason. Hot. Hello Instagram friends. This is Fiona, I just wanted to update you all. I am alive and alone in this park. And I'm going to the party. Hmm, I don't like that. Oh my God. LOL, nice. You going to the crush party later? - Please don't. - I actually don't know. But I'm gonna trust you on this one. Again, don't let me down and let's go. Hey, uh, how's the not studying going? I think I'm gonna go. No, wait. - Uh, have... - Sorry. Guys, my friend Paul. He's one of the nicest guys I've ever, ever met. He's actually very trendy as well. He's kidding. But seriously, this guy is great. I mean if I were you. Um, are you going to Big Blue later? We got lost. It's just down the hill. We'll get you there in time. - Okay, one. - Ah! Two. Every one of our body's atoms is traceable to the Big Bang. We are made of star matter. We are not simply in the universe. We are a part of it. We are born. You might even say we've been empowered by the universe to figure it out and we've only just begun. Oh my God, Izzy. Are you okay? Deelep and Meena, they saved me. Uh, okay. Let me just. Whoa, oh my God, that's so sweet. Thank you so much. What time is it? It's 10:57. Three minutes, hmm! Sorry about your skateboard. Sorry, she's embarrassing sometimes. Dude. She breaks your board. What's next, your heart? This isn't a Soviet film, this is your life, man. Can you shut up? So frustrating. That no one takes my art seriously because I'm an athlete. - Izzy. - Ah, I feel really weird. Izzy, you're fine, okay. I have have to go. You're now will be here soon. Georgie messaged you on Tinder. So flirt with him. Yeah? I'm gonna go. What? Hello, I've been crushed. Excuse me, sorry. Izzy. Isabelle Alden. A-L-D-E-N, like Baldwin but not Baldwin. Just kidding. Enjoy. Can I have some of your water? What the fuck happened to the music? There's a cooler art party down the street. Let's go to the that. Come on guys, come back to ours. No music. Don't make fun of this kid, he doesn't know what he's doing. God, okay. Ah, thank you so much. Yeah, so I don't know. It's always just been like a personal dream of mine to like break the sound barrier, jet plane, you know, Mach 3 or 4. - Yeah. - I don't know. Like Speed Runner. I'm inside alone. I don't know what to do. What, you're already there? Where's Anuka? She left. I've been waiting for you guys at the playground. Why? Eh, whatever. We didn't have sex. Running man emoji. - Break the sound barrier. - Hmm hmm. Apparently, cum travels at 65 miles an hour which when I found that out, I'm just like so scared. - Wow, that's crazy. - Yeah. That's not possible. That's like double the speed limit on Main Street, so. - Oh. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Okay. - Anyways. - Yeah, it's like. Yeah. But I heard it's even faster if you eat celery. Thanks. It should work now. I like your shirt. Thanks, it was my grandpa's. He was the music producer of some Christian Death Metal group. My grandpa was in the music industry. Woe, sick shoes. Hey, you wanna help me DJ, make out, then go home together and have romantic sex on my twin Xl bed? I would love to have romantic sex with you on your twin XL bed. I like your shirt. What? I like your shirt, what does it say? What? What does it say? Your shirt. I don't know, I got it at a thrift store. Oh, cool! I have a lot of those too. Yeah, cool. Have eye sex with someone on the dance floor. Deep like one of his photos. You don't wanna end your freshman year still a virgin, do you? Hey, you made it? Yeah. You smell great. Thanks. What you up too buddy? I'm not at a party. Are you smoking? It's not lit. Uh, how's the party? Not lit, either. Wait, JuJu, you're frozen. You need a light? Um. Can I call you back? Wait, wait, who's that? - Bye. - Who's that guy... I'm trying to quit, so. So, you fake smoke at parties? You mind if I join you for one? Um hmm. Anuka, right? Yeah. So uh, who's JuJu? My boyfriend, I guess. I guess? Wait, how come you're not inside? I wasn't crushed. What do you mean? I mean, that nobody crushed me. Wait so if you weren't crushed, that means. Izzy got crushed for real. What? Wait, you weren't crushed for real? Well, you don't have to rub it in. No. Sorry. I just feel like your background deserves more than this. Like. - Your cultural... - Oh! So you mean, I should put all the Hindu gods all over the place? - No, I mean... - No. Just like if this is a self-portrait. Yeah, which is ugly because I am ugly. - No. - No. What? Uh, it just doesn't seem as unique as you do. It's okay. I, look, I've just seen some stuff like this before. Oh. I can be kind of an asshole, I know. Yeah, I've heard that. - Yeah? - Hmm hmm. What have you heard? That you wrote a sexist crossword puzzle in a newspaper or something. All right, I didn't even think it was that bad. Oh. The clue was the skin around the vagina for a five letter word. Labia? Woman. I guess it incorporates my cis, straight white male, privilege background pretty nicely. Hmm hmm, definitely. Ew, JuJu? Hi. Izzy said you left? - Hey, I'm Fiona. - Hey, I'm Rex. Yeah, I know who you are. You're the vagina man. Um, where's Izzy? Inside. Oh, Izzy's on her way to bonetown. Welcome, welcome to the bonetown. No, you don't know that song? Nope, no I don't, do you. Hmm hmm, no. Hmm, that's fine. Have you seen Elise, 'cause she slummed my DM's. Well, she's probably inside. But they won't let you in if you're not crushed. They won't let me in if I'm not, what are you talking about? Let's just go through a window. - Is this really necessary? - Yes. Hey you guys, we can just get in through the back door? What! You know, I'm not gay, right? No, not me either. Okay, good. Shit! Shit. They were a part of my great grandmother's dowry. My great grandparents soul is preserved in these. Soon to be followed by my grandparents and my parents and then me. Come on grandma. Tell me where grandpa is. One sec. I thought you left. I made out with Georgie. He smelled like a kitty litter box. Cool. Wait, are you? Hey, hey, hey, Nolan's over there. Go and make out with him. I already made a fool of myself. Izzy, come on. I'm gonna find Elise, just go make out with Nolan. Okay, please, yes, thank you. All right, gig's up folks. Too many noise complaints. Anuka, someone crushed me. Did you guys leave? Izzy? Hey Izzy, aw, are you okay? Dispatch, put me at the house party. Fiona, those are my shoes! Your friend has my shoes. What the fuck! She vomited on them. You took those from the bowling alley and didn't tell me? You knew I got in trouble? You have this young lady's shoes? Give me my shoes back. That's actually psychotic? You realize that you're the reason I might get fired right, like you're the reason College Lanes might close. You know, I love working there Izzy. I got a whole lecture today. I guess you should have stayed at home and studied. I think maybe you should come with me and sober up a little bit young lady. I love y'all like you're my own but you're a lot. You a freshman? I have a speech for freshmen who don't their substance limits. I like to remind you kids that the world ain't easy all the time. You're all just fishes. Swimming upstream, fins against the current. When you're in college, it's easy to forget that we're all just a school of fish who are people. On this Earth for different reasons but swimming in the same waters. Izzy, 19. I have a decent Yelp review. Look me up. Cat emoji, heart emoji, smiling poop face emoji. I seem like the biggest weirdo. Most important, love yourself. Keep that love somewhere around your mind like a love fish. He's a slippery fellow. But if you ever find yourself lost or unsure, just try catching that love fish and hold on tight and don't let go. Oh shoot, I'm sorry. I thought today would be the night I had to leap and mean it and they're souls and they're good luck but not for me. My friends, they don't get it because it's never been hard for them. They just look at a guy and he comes to them and that's it.
