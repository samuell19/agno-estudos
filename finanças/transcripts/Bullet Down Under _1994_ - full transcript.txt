(MultiCom jingle) (police siren wails) - Police, freeze! (gun fires) (Hood screams) - [Hood] You fucking killed a kid! Oh shit. You killed a kid! - [Officer] Hey Marty, I have this guy. - You killed a little kid, you feel good, huh? You killed a little kid! Idiot! (shotgun fires) (dog barks) - [Dispatch] All available units, reports of gunfire. Fiero Street on Celwood, Block Green. (police siren wails) - 23, yeah I got it. We're just around the corner. (tires squeal) - Bloody tomato. Blood cucumber. - Bloody idiot, stop complaining! You order it every day! - Jeez, harper. - Oh shit! - Not to worry, Boza. We're under control. - Jesus, Jack. Watch the citizens. (Jack yells) (dog barks) - What happened!? - There was a black, two-door car, went down to the end, turned right, left? - Right, left, which was it!? - Uh, left. - Aww, gee. Boza, sorry to disturb you, but there's someone dead on a clothesline. - So, is he dry yet? Will you slow down for Christ's sake. You don't even know where he went. - Don't worry, Boza. It's all dead ends around here. - That's what I'm afraid of. There he is! - Oh good eyes, Boza! - [Boza] You gotta be the world's worst driver. - Which way, Boza? - This one. Boza, Boza, I got him, I got him! - Got me falling back for lunch, I'm getting my bloody dollar's worth. - Get you're gun out, you love that old fashioned shit. Shit, Boza! - There's the bastard. Jesus, Jack. Watch it! This man is myrtle. - Give me a cragby. Oh shit! - Look out! Get outta there, get outta there, Boza! (gun fires) (Jack yells) (heart-rate monitor beeps) Hold on, Boza. Hold on! Hold on, Boza! I'll get him, Boza. I swear I'll get him. - Excuse me, excuse-- - No comment! - Excuse me, can you tell where I can find Sergeant Grimmer? - Got so Sergeant Grimmer here. - I'm looking for Sergeant Grimmer. - Talks funny, dunnit he? Can hardly understand a word he's saying. - Okay, I get it. I married one. G'day! Can you tell me where I can find Sergeant Grimmer? - Oh, why didn't you say so in the first place? - Bullet, right? Come in, I've been expecting you. Have a good trip? - Yeah. - Right, glad to have you on board. Sign there. I'm glad I met you. When you get a moment I'd like to hear your side of the story. (gun fires) We're not as big on guns here as you are, but we still got plenty of tough bastards on the street, and it's getting worse. Speaking of tough bastards, I'd like you to meet your partner. (gun fires) Martin Bullet, Jack Moran. Martin's from Los Angeles, Beverley Hills, ya know? - Bullet. How'd you get a name like that. - Same as you got yours, it was all settled before I had much say in the matter. - Here, take a shot. - Didn't leave me much. - Hey, you're partner's right? Get on together, through sickness and in health. - Till death do us part! - Shit, my fault you put your foot in. I was gonna tell ya later. Come on, I'll buy you a coffee. (guns fire) - Doug. We'd hide 'em in a good place. In a good place. In a good place. Good place. (rock music blaring) Think like Doug, think. Think like Doug. - Dougie? Can I go in front of Robert this week? He's got others digging actresses everywhere, and I haven't been seen in weeks. - You can go in front, tell him from me. - [TV] Now we go live to our reporter at the police station. - Police have reason to believe that the shooting was a gang dispute over a drug deal. With me is Officer Moran. One person is dead and an officer is injured. When gang warfare spills over into residential neighborhoods, innocent people can get hurt. - Innocent people do get hurt, even innocent police officers. It's our job to stop these guys, and we will! Thank you. - Yeah, newsroom, thanks. Yeah, I was wondering if you know anything about the guy that was shot, like who was he, what'd he looked like? Who am I? What does it matter who I am? I'm a viewer! Was he short, fat, what? You don't need my name! Forget it. Where is he? Where? Where is he? (heavy rock music) ♫ I don't wanna live like a stone age man can ♫ And take what I want ♫ Gotta hate love ♫ Gotta hate love - Customer. Come to my change thing? - I'm sorry about what I said yesterday. Grimmer told me what happened to your last partner. - He's still my partner. Don't worry, we'll get the bastards. - What do you have in mind? - Let's go rattle some cages. - Jack? Hey, hey, Jack. It's me, Sal! No need for all this. - Hey, I know it's you, Sal. Come on you little putt. Sal, I just wanna talk. Better still on and listen. - I don't know nothing. - Sure you do. You got your ear to the ground, right? You got a safe place. It's filthy. - I just mind my own business, that's it. - That's the problem. Never call ya a bully, you could just leave it at that. Some people, come on. (sensual music) Sal, you remember Boza, don't you? - Help. - Exactly, help. That's what I need. Get in there. I want a name. I'll give you a clue: shooter, wears an earring. - Earring? I don't know nobody with earrings, honest. - That's not good enough! - I dunno, please. - I want a name. - I swear, please! - That's not good enough. - I swear! (Sal yells) - Boo. - Hey Jack, where are ya? Get me down from here! Hey, Jack! You're in trouble, mate. - [Bullet] Did you really think he knew something? - I bet he knows someone who knows someone else, who knows something about it. That was just a wake-up call for the whole scummy mob. - How'd you know those cords were gonna hold? - Beats the hell outta me. - Hey Jack! I'm having lunch with the commissioner this week, you're in trouble, mate! Gina, get me down from here! (phone rings) - Yeah? - Doug? Dougie? - Frankie, for Christ's sake. What happened? Where are you? Why didn't you call me!? - I am. - Why didn't you call earlier? The TV says somebody got shot. Jeez, I thought it was you. I was on me way to the morgue! - Nah, there's nothing-- - [Doug] Why didn't you come back here, like we arranged? - Because he saw me. - Who? - The copper. He come find me in the corner and he saw me. So I reckon I better hide out. - It was a simple deal. Give him the stuff, you take the money. But my idiot brother's gotta start a war over it! - Don't call me an idiot, Doug. He was gonna take the money. I showed him. All 150,000, and he wanted to take it. And then he-- He made some crack, just like they used to at school, like I couldn't count it. - So you killed him? - Yeah, 'cause he was gonna take it. - How'd you know? - Because I have a sixth sense, and I could tell. - You wouldn't know if your arse was on fire! - Yes I could. You just stop it. 'Cause if you don't... I'll hang up. - No, no. Alright, mate. Don't hang up. - And you know that other guy with the earring? He had a gun, and he knew it. He nearly got me too, but I finally got him. - Some shooter, with an earing? He got away? - Yeah, I knew he got 'em, but he just jumped clear. - Frank, listen. Listen, mate. He's gonna find you. Tell me where you are. - He's not gonna find me. - He'll. Find. You. And then you're dead. - He dropped his bag, and I got all his stuff. - You got their stuff? - Everything. - Holy shit. - Doug? Dougie? - Are you there? - Will you shut up! - Don't tell me to shut up, I'm trying to think! - Nah, not you. - Not me!? So you're gonna start doing the thinking for us? We might as well jump off the bridge now. Moron. - Don't yell at me, Doug. Don't yell at me. - Don't do anything. Especially, don't think. Tell me where you are. I'll come and get you. - Are you gonna yell at me? - Where the fuck are you!? Where!? - [Charlene] Does it make you think about maybe having one of your own? - No, hell of a world to bring kids into. - Please, give me a break. - I saw you, here you go. You don't see what I see everyday. - Oh for Christ's sake. You're talking about little kids. They jump and down on the surf, they don't live in a cop's world. We came here to get away from all of that. Believe me, it's different here. - It's not that different. - Well at least kids don't carry guns to school. - Not yet. - Oh come on. Snap out of it, will you? We've got to decide whether we're gonna get on with our lives or keep reliving what happened in LA. I'm for getting on with it. What about you? - Thank you for agreeing to meet me. This has been a terrible tragedy. I can only offer my condolences to the family of the man who died. And apologize to you. I hope you understand, this is the last thing I wanted to happen. - Yes, thank you for your thoughts. It's the guns. Where there are guns, people die. No one wanted this to happen. But it happened, and we must go on. - Terrible misunderstanding. - Young men. - They don't understand business. - What can you do? - I wonder if I can speak frankly? - I hope so. - I have fear. I fear for the life of my brother. - We are in a difficult situation. - Revenge, it's not good business. Never solves anything. - Yes, you are right. Revenge is for young men, not businessmen. I think we can still sort this out. I understand you are still in possession of the goods. - That's right. - Well, perhaps if you can now deliver the funds we can now consider the matter finished. - You'll call your man off, The one with the earing? - Of course. - I'll make all the arrangements and get back to you right away. Thank you. Thank you, thank you. - Cheap bastard, how stupid does he think I am. Of course you can blow away our guys. No revenge, no trouble from us! Sure, I'm gonna drop 150 big ones in his lap. Kiss my ass. (phone dials) Officer Moran, please. - Okay, it's known at 36 Mitchel Street. We have one deceased, an oriental, 28 years. The method was a 12-gauge, two shot. Witnesses were neighbors. We've got a black car, two-door, and you said you saw a black baseball cap? - I only saw the back of his head. Saw an earing in the shape of a T. - What about the other guy, did anybody see him? - No. How's Charlene? - She's fine, she's really glad to be back. Do you have a girlfriend or someone you'd like to bring over? Charlene sure would like to cook you dinner sometime. - Yeah, that'd be right neighborly of you. - Great. - Hey Jack, line two, mate. - Moran here. - Look, I've got some information, you might be interested. I bought that guy that run down that cop. He wears an earing, works for a guy called Chang Kai Chee. - Where would I find this fellow, Chee? - His name's Chang. He's got a place down by the rocks, importing. Mainland Enterprises. - [Jack] Where would I find-- - You can look it up! - Can I get a name? (dial tone) Let's go. - Wanna go first? - No, not if you want to. What now, praying? - It's gonna be a lot darker in there, I want my eyes to get adjusted. Is that alright with you? You sure this is the right place? - I'm not sure this is the right country. Clear! - Authentic, made in Australia. You think that's a bit misleading, do you? - Perhaps. But I see crockery in every woodworks. They call it China. So what can a poor businessman do? - Does he come back. - It depends. - Depends? Well if it doesn't, I'll close the joint. - On what grounds? - I dunno. Fraud? - Hygiene? - We just lay the charges-- - Let the courts decide. - Shouldn't take more than... - A few months. - A few months. - Where did you learn to do that? - Beverly Hilly Boomerang Club. Who's that? It's him, it's him! - Go! - Stop! Hold it! - Shoot the bastard, shoot the bastard! - Freeze! (gun fires) - I can believe it, he jumped. He jumped! You hit him, you hit him twice. - In the back. - In the back, front, side. Who cares!? He ran Boza down. For some stupid, freaked out reason, you've got a problem with your weapon. What do you use it to protect the public and fellow officers? Answer me! - You know you're way outta line pal, way outta line! - Your problem can get me killed. It's a gun, you gotta shoot it. It doesn't work like a boomerang. It won't come back. (punch thuds) You had enough!? You had enough? Lay down! No more, you made your point! You made your point. Come on. - You give up yet? - You made your point. - Hi, honey. Guess what? - What? - So what I do I get? A "What" and the back of your head. If you turned around now, you'd be looking at a wife who's got a job. - It's not as bad as it looks. - Oh, God. What happened? - It's kind of complicated. - What happened? You come home with your face like a trampled pizza and all you can say is it's complicated? - I had a fight with my partner. - Oh, terrific. Did you win? Hold still - Ow, just leave it alone. It'll be alright. - So you and Jack just decided to go at it for no reason? - Yeah, sort of. - For no reason? - Is that the way you do it here in Australia, you beat the shit out of each other, then you're mates for life, right? - Ah, some sort of male bonding ritual. (police sirens wail) - Police! Freeze! - [Jack] Shoot the bastard, shoot the bastard! (gun fires) - [Hood] You killed a kid, you killed a kid! (Bullet pants) Fuck, you killed a kid. You killed a kid. I had the gun! You killed a kid, you killed a kid! Hey copper, you killed a little kid. You killed a little kid, feel good, huh? You killed a fucking kid. Get out of here you idiot. (knocking) - [Jack] Oi, you awake? Woo, woo. Room service! Can I come in, the coffee's still hot. - I'll need a straw. - I bought one. - No you didn't. - No you're right, I didn't. (heavy rock music) - Welcome back, asshole. - Bugger. ♫ You won't leave me ♫ You can take a hike ♫ You won't leave me ♫ I'm not judging by ♫ Don't think you're halfway there ♫ This ain't no love affair ♫ No way ♫ Just gotta hate love ♫ Hey sister did you get my jive ♫ When you're hair reads nine to five ♫ I'll show my butt ♫ Kick you in style ♫ The way ♫ No way babe ♫ You won't leave-- (drums crash) - [Dispatch] Nelson and Harper. 278th Harper Street. Fight, up to 10 people involved. Car 48, is that you still in the area? - No fess and puncher. Could do with some comic relief. You wanna take that? Might be some fun. (siren wails) Trouble with this younger generation: They're stale and pale. - So um... What happened here? - I'm sorry. - [Bullet] I bet you are. - That bastard! - They look like they're more sorry. - They're not very nice people. I'm nice. - I'll kill him! - [Jack] No one's gonna kill anybody. - He busted everything! - [Jack] What, for no reason? - Stupid, fat prick. - You didn't say nothing to him, did ya? - He's crazy. Totally crazy. It's like we were minding our own business, right. Right, just playing, minding our own business, then he comes along and it's fecking mayhem. - Watch your language, will you son? - This gentlemen, what'd you say your name was? - Franklin. - Franklin. - Nah man, he's bonkers! - Come here for a minute. What do you think? - Bedlam mayhem. And what were you doing sir, when this all started? - I was just sitting over there. - And what were you doing over there? - I was staying there. - What, you live here? - Just for a little bit. - Well, just for the past few days? - Just for a few days, and sometimes I stay there in the nights, sometimes. - What're you gonna do about our stuff mate? What're you gonna do? - Well I'll tell ya. The police work's about making decisions. - Yeah, and I want a decision, now. - And my decision is I wouldn't trust a word you said if you had the hand on the grave of Sid Vicious. - Huh, what do you mean? - You'll be staying there a little while longer? - [Franklin] Yeah. - Alright, I think you can head back and we'll forget about this whole thing, okay? - I can go? Okay. - Is this yours? - It's my car. - This ain't right, we was the victims. - I suggest you all get outta here. - He said, "Why don't you guys all "get outta here and don't come back?" You understand? - Don't you just love being a peacemaker? - This ain't right! Guy's a fucking madman. Could be a killer or something, eh. Bloody cops. - Don't you think we shoulda taken that big guy in? - We woulda had to take 'em all in. Did you really want to spend all of today typing out reports on all of that, friend? - That's what I like about you, always thinking. - Yeah. - There must be something we can get. - Well there's not much chance of skin or hair, but sometimes we can still get a print. - What's that, is that blood? - Only wish it was, no it's just lipstick, melted. - Okay, thanks. Call us if you have any luck. - You find your man and we'll put him at the scene. - Earing man, tell me where I can find the earing man. - I've never seen him before. He's got nothing to do with me. - That's no help at all. What was he doing here? - Can't help you. - Of course not. It doesn't matter, though. You're fucked mate, and you don't even know it. Mr. Earing is on the run and we're right up his ass! The guy that double-crossed you is in a warehouse on Nelson. We're going to get him and when we do, he's gonna tell us all about you, the drugs, the whole sting. - Don't know anything. - Think about it. (phone rings) - Greeting, Club Medusa. Can I help you? Yeah sure, one moment. Dougie? - Yeah? - [Dancer] Phone. - Alright. Hello? - [Franklin] It's me again. - Are you alright. - Got in a little bit... Of trouble. - What trouble? - Uh... It doesn't matter. Like I shouldn't have mentioned it anyway. - Well what trouble!? - Don't yell at me, Doug. - You're gonna get yourself killed. And you know something? I don't give a shit anymore! - That's a lie Doug, I know you do 'cause you love me. 'Cause I'm your little brother. - Save me. - Look, it was just some hippies, Doug. Just hippies and I was just making noise. That's all. - [Doug] You got into a fight? - Yeah, but the copper-- - What cop!? - You're not gonna believe this, Doug it was that same copper, you know the blonde one with the spiky hair? But he didn't even recognize me. - Moran. - Just don't call me those names, Doug. - No, no, no. Moran, the cop's name. - How would I know that, Doug? - Listen to me, listen to me you imbecile. Listen. Where are you? - I'm in a phone box but... I'm just not gonna tell you whereabouts. (Franklin laughs) (dial tone) And it's just got him, a beauty. (window shatters) (Franklin yells) (shotgun fires) (Franklin yells) (toilet flushes) (Franklin yells) - When he gets here, tell Jack I want to see him, will ya? (telephone rings) - Morning Jack. - Morning. - Grimmer's been lookin' to see you. - What for? - Dunno, neighbors award? - Jack, get in. I've been trying to call you, where the hell you been? - Been on a stakeout. - And!? - Nothing. - Nobody knows this yet, I've been waiting for you. Boza. Three o'clock this morning. - Shit. - Wanna get drunk? - No. - You wanna work? - What do you mean? - Come on, come with me. (exotic dance music) - Hold on a minute, I gotta take a leak. - I'll keep watch. - I don't know what's better, drinking it in or pissing it out. What do you think? - Gig's all tight. - I used to think I could tell a two-mane towards a bat pretty easy. Will you look at that and tell me you don't feel confused? - No, no, no. You're looking at the wrong things. You can't look at the tits, you gotta look at the hands. Look at the hands. Where can I find Doug Button? - Up front. - What're we doing here. - Got a call this afternoon from a guy named Button, Doug Button. He says he's ready to make a deal and you know where his brother is. That make sense to you? Button? - They found him. - You called us down here, you got something to say, say it. - I know what you're doing. - That's good, I'm glad somebody does. - I saw you on the TV. - You said you had something to tell us. - I said I want to make a deal. - Make it. - That cop that got hurt there, my brother Frankie had nothing to do with it. - Your brother was there, now what was your brother doing there? - He didn't run over any cop. - Okay, let's say he didn't. What then? - I might be able to help you find the guy who did. - Oh that's real nice of you. Okay, where is he? Who is he? - First, I've got a problem. - If you're withholding material evidence in a murder, you've got a real problem. - You're not exactly going by the book yourself. - So sue us. - It's not funny. You think using my brother is funny? - What do you mean? - Don't play games, you were there. Didn't arrest though, did you? Couldn't figure it, it didn't make sense. You knew who he was and you did nothing. - What're you talking about? - If you're gonna use him like some sort of bait, you bastards. - Franklin? The guy with the toy car!? - The black car! Tell me who was in the black car! - That's the plan. Drop the word on Frankie and hope your man shows. - The guy with the earing, I want him. - I'll give you the guy, but Frankie walks. That's the deal, okay? - Give me a name. - His name's Toni. I'll set it up, stick by the phone. - What does Toni do that when you don't open for business? - He likes killing cops. - You got a deal. I get Toni, Frankie walks. You fuck me around I guarantee a family tragedy. (girls chatter) - What're you going to do? - Get as far away from you as possible. - Oh, you're going to run out? - As fast as I can. - Why!? - Are you serious? Are you so far gone you don't even know what you're doing? - I made a deal, happens on the courthouse steps every day! - You knew who Frankie was all along. You're setting me up, you're setting him up. What else? Did I miss anything? - Yeah, you missed the point! - No, you lied to me, you're playing games with people's lives. You're making deals you can't backup. You're over the line, that's what the other side thinks. - Maybe you're right! Maybe I stopped being a cop, but I made Boza a promise, and I didn't make it as a cop. I made it as a man, a friend! (cat yelps) - Hi. That's a hell of a welcome for a girl with a paycheck. Come on, give us a kiss. What's the matter? - [Bullet] I walked out on Jack today. - Good move. - I think he's in trouble. - Jackie is trouble. You know that, so leave him be. - He doesn't have anybody, he doesn't trust anybody. If I don't back him up, nobody else will. - Is that what you want to do? - I don't know, I just-- I don't know. He doesn't play by the book. He's dangerous. I don't know if I want him to be my partner. - What happened to the bonding ritual? Beating each other up, mates for life? - I'm afraid he's gonna get himself killed. - That'll teach him. - You don't mean that. - Do you? - No. - So what're you going to do? - You're a hell of a woman, you know that? - Yeah, I know. - Frankie! Frankie, Frankie! Frank... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. They set you up. Bastards. Don't you worry. I'll take of it for you, eh. Just like I used to. I'll take care of all of it. (Doug sobs) - Jack? Jack? (knocking) - Martin? Did you forget your key? - Don't, be silly, huh? That's it. You'll probably want to thank me for this. Don't bother. Moran will be at Fitness Network Gym later tonight, looking for Toni. I reckon you can take it from there. - He'll be waiting for you there. Take your time. Be imaginative. (phone rings) - [Doug] Be at Fitness Network Gym later ton-- - Yeah, it's Martin. Is Jack there? I need to speak to him right away, I've got very important information. Whatever you do, don't let him leave. - Hey Jack, it's Marty. Says it's important. I'll get him to give you a call. - No, I need to talk to him right now! Put him on the phone. - I need to know more, give me some sort of description. Height, weight, eyes? Something. - I don't know exactly. You've seen him better than I have. Anyway, the earing. You'll know him by the earing. - When exactly will he be there? - Late, sometime. I don't know. You're just gonna have to wait for him. It's the best I can do. - [Jack] That better be good enough. - Your turn, where's my brother? - He's in a warehouse on Nelson, top floor. - See. Isn't it easy when people deal straight with each other? - Nutter. (Bullet whistles) - [Bullet] Hey, hey! Hey! - Hey, Jack. There's a call for you. It's Marty, ya dickhead. - Where is he? - Just left. - What!? Did he leave any messages? - No. - Well where did he go? - I dunno, he didn't say. - Well why didn't you stop him? - You ever tried stopping Jack? Just left in a hell of a hurry. - Alright look, if he calls I'll be at my house, okay? Alright? - Showtime. (ominous music) (gun fires) (Charlene screams) (Doug yells) - Get down, get outta the way! It's alright. - Who was he? He was waiting for you. He said a name, he said it was for Frankie? - It's alright, it's alright. It's alright. You got some blood on your face, is it yours? - It's not my blood. - No? Okay, come on. - Excuse me, when do you close? - Round about three. - Are people still coming in by then? - You'd be surprised. - You wouldn't know someone called Toni, would you? - Look, we get a lot of people through here. Is he a regular? - Yeah, I guess so. - Well what does he look like? - He wears an earing in his left ear. - Hey Steve, is Toni here tonight? He's upstairs. - Okay, thanks. - Something in particular that you're interested in? Blood perv, piss off. - Relax, it's a mistake. - Yeah, it sure is. - Don't push it. - What're you gonna do about it, midget? (Jack laughs) - You drink your milk out of a saucer, you big pussy. Now fuck off! - What're you up to? - What? - I know you're counting. What're you up to? - I got tired at about 30. - I never get tired. - I bet you don't. - I've seen you before. - I don't think so. I'd remember you. - That's sweet. Maybe it was here, do you come here much? - No. First time. - Thanks everybody, it's been a great night, and I'm sure you'll all look better for it. Can you make that last set because we're about to close up now. - Do you find that you sometimes can't sleep because you get all pumped up? - Maybe a drink would help. - That'd be nice. - Where would you like to go? - Well you know it's a madhouse in the lockers here when they close up. If it's okay with you, I could take a shower at your place? - Let's go! - Hold it, hold it. - Sorry, we're closed. - Big oaf, wide spiky hair, did you see him leave? - Yeah, I think so. He got lucky. - He left with a woman? - Yeah, she was all over him like a rash. Beats me how with his looks. - Nah. - I've never met a cop before. Do you carry a gun or are you just glad to see me? I've always wanted to say that. You must meet a lot of interesting people. - Oh yeah, like who? - Oh I dunno, gangsters? - Gangsters? There's no such thing as gangsters, just stupid, sleazy idiots. Sorry, I didn't mean to go on. - That's alright. So, you working on a case right now? That's it, that's where I saw you, on TV! Something terrible happened to another policeman. - Yeah, that's right. - Was it something to do with drugs or something like that? - Maybe, don't know yet. Just hoods shooting hoods. Give 'em enough bullets and they can all shoot themselves. - You didn't find any drugs? - Not yet. - It's pretty exciting stuff. Do you always find your man? - Can we talk about something else? - Yeah, look I'm sorry. I didn't meant to bring you down. No more shop talk, okay? - Okay. Well this is it. Make yourself at home. - You're real nice and tidy. I always thought cops lived in a real mess. - What would you like? - I'm gonna take a shower, can you fix me a drink?
