She is my best friend That does not mean you should not propose her Not that I should not… just in case she does not like it You are worried that your friendship will be affected right? Yes! Just in case you don’t tell her, she will never know, and what if she also has feelings for you? She would have said it If it is this difficult for you as a boy to express, imagine a girl’s plight! This is quite common for those who are in love. Just go and express how much you like her, she will for sure agree Even if she does not, she will at least know that you are loving her. whatever happens will only happen if you say Paddu is coming! Oh is it! Go then…all the best Surya I have been hiding this for 3 years, I cannot do it any further, I love you Paddu you took so much time to say this!...i was waiting for this moment Yesssss!

Happiness… Happiness… The concept of our program is…. One Second… every program here should go as per my vision... what mister gave you the script…why are you still here? You need my blessings? Sir! You said you would shift my program to prime time. Prime time is not pop-corn to give you as soon as you ask for it. I need to get the permission from the Superiors Motivation in you the inspiration of bringing you up..must come in me For now, give it an intermission and manage your mission first. Give me once chance sir! Look If you pester me like this for Prime Time,I will shift you to Crime Time! You will commit suicide after reporting all those rape and murder related stuff Go... You know about him and why do you still ask? If you stop trying because there is a problem, how will you fulfil your dreams? I am not sure what this squirrel faced Guy wrote in the script. Seeing the girl Hai Listeners! Today’s topic on our show is ‘Love at first sight’ Love born at first glance We heard in ' RAMAYANA ' that Sita loved Rama at her first sight. All the love stories from Tretayug to Kaliyug began with Love First Sight. So… let’s start our show with a poem on the magic of ‘Love at first sight’ by PD…. “At your first glance on the girl" “At your first glance on the girl" Lightning should come from your eyes Thunders should strike her heart In that love cyclone… Girl Father & Mother should be washed away.. Aaaa...Let’s take our first call.... Hello! I just heard Your PD’s poem Sir and with his inspiration I too have something to say Yes please “Dear PD…Dear PD… Your ears will be pierced if I start abusing you Your body will get stiches if I start bullying you Your photo will be garlanded if I come over to your office…Dirty idiot! You cannot write anything just because we are listening! Thanks a lot for your affection! This guy’s words had meaning along with rhyming! Let’s see who our next caller is! Hello… Hello… aaa....Hello… Why don’t you speak? Sorry Brother! I am just fixing my peg. aah Peg? In the Early Morning? Not the Whisky, Brandy, Vodka peg you know of…poison! Po…Po… Poisonnn??? I decided to end my life brother. The reason I called you is to let you know that you are the reason for it Meee??? Yes you!!! how come i am the reason? I took the advice you gave a caller last week to propose his love and not hide it. I proposed my love to my Girl Friend and she rejected! I just want to die now! Do you have to end your life just because your Girl Friend rejected Sir? What else should i do? How will a person like you who gives free love advice on air understand the pain in life? I might be the reason for you to propose her, but I do not agree that Love Failure is the reason for your suicide Why? There is nothing called Love Failure! aaa Nothing called Love Failure? Absolutely How old are you brother? For? You speak like a kid What do you mean? Had you ever been in love, you will never speak like this So, you mean that I was never in love? So, you say this when you are in love then? Yes Is it? Well then…tell us about your love story and lover If you prove that there is no Love Failure I will Drop This program is for you people to tell…not me Tell us If you cannot, accept that what you had just said is wrong and l will go ahead with my suicide. Just in case you are thinking that you are in a fix you should think twice before you say anything to a clever guy like me No… I am just thinking from where I need to start The topic that day was ‘Love at First Sight’, so you can start from there I was walking along on the beach side that day… Running waves in the moonlight, the sea appeared more excited than usual. After I walked for a while, I could understand the reason why! She looked like a Peacock dancing on the Sea shore Her face like smile the silence between her lips. The foam from the waves gently touched her feet. Unknown anguish in her constant gaze towards the moon… And then? To know what happened then, tune into our show next week on Radio City 91.1. Just another week of wait. Till next week? Hello…. Hello brother… How many times should I remind you not to tell personal stories? Sir! It was not my personal story it was fictitious! Fictitious??? Yes Sir! Instantly cooked up story only to divert the caller from his suicide plot You counted on that unwise caller’s words? It is those people like him who commit suicide for petty reasons What if he calls again? Good for us We will know at least that he did not commit suicide What if he asks what had happened next in Your fictitious Story I can figure out something sir…don’t worry! What is the concept of the show and what is that you are doing? Live programs do not run on concepts... they run on improvisations! You have to improvise based on the situation Hello Radio City 91.1 What had happened next? Did Krish meet the girl? Which girl? The girl he saw on the beach Girl on the beach? The girl from Krish’s love story where is that girl to meet!..where?..where do you come from...Yoooo...cut the call Hey Baby! Here is a rose with a dash of love dose… only if you could give me a smiling pose… I have something for you on my feet! Do you need love? Your Something is Yours...My Flower is Mine...My Lover is Somewhere...Aaaahhh.. Seshu Ware is sinkaa.. Sinka! Why do you look so tensed? Kattappa is in the campus Kattappa???? What are you saying? Fresh Chicken, Singareni Kaatam Raju Singarakonda Sivagami How did you dare lay your hand on Kaatam Raju? Kadhiri Kattappa Jai Mahishmathi Why don’t you give me an idea instead of smiling? You need to praise their beauty for girls to fall for you Sinka will sincerely follow your advice Let’s see! Hey Anand, are you up for the beach this evening? Baby is alone for a while now, let me do a trial Enough footage for Facebook You are beautiful In fact, you are very beautiful! One more time You are very beautiful Say it loud You are very.... Say it now You look very angry Hello mom Why dint you come home? I am at the beach Ok. Come back early Ok mom, I will Bye Darling Bye She looked like a Peacock dancing on the Sea shore Her face like smile the silence between her lips. The foam from the waves gently touched her feet. Unknown anguish in her constant gaze towards the moon… He.. Did you not go to sleep? Where have you been? You mobile is switched off as well I did not check that It’s ok. Come have dinner I don’t feel hungry mom What happened darling? Senseless Fellows, Senseless Fellows! Sir Script I have decided not to write any scripts Why? I am being abused in live for my creative poems. People like your fake stories and they call me up to know what happened next Hello Is that Krish? I am his boss What sir? Krish still did not start the program He will. Can’t you wait till he does? That is why I have decided not to give Ph.D. lectures to a 10th grade students For those who like fake stories, my creativity will be a burden Go..Continue Your Fake Story Sirrr fake story I understand Running the show without my guidance will be a challenge, but you have to. My only concern is that my creativity is being killed I will continue sir aa..aaa Krish! What happened next? Did you meet her? It happened How did you meet a girl whom you could not find on searching for hours that night? Even if you had missed her, how long it would have taken you to find her in Vizag? I had the same thought, but the next day Did you see her? Women’s Colleges, Engineering Colleges, Cinema Halls, Shopping Malls, Kailasagiri to Simhachalam, Gangavaram, Yarada, Ramakrishna, Rushikonda, Bheemili Beach. From Andhra University to Araku Valley, apart from these, Jagadamba Junction Gajuwaka Center Gopalapatnam, Akkayyapalem, Madhurawada, Chinnawaltair, Peda Waltair Seethammadhara…. I covered every nook and corner of the city for her Ohh! Girls are all the same brother. They appear, they make you run, they make you fall in love and then they make you drink alcohol Is it? Brother! Do not let yourself down that you could not see her again. If not her, someone else Where is the girl to see? Did I say I did not see her again? aaahhh..... That is what I thought you said till now? You did not let me finish! Ohh! Sorry brother What happened next? Super Party bro! Good Morning Students Good Morning Sir Java… Java was designed by James Gosling. Do you know which company helped him? Microsoft! No! Oracle sir Good guess, but no. Oracle Developed it any one ? Sun Microsystems. One more question. What was the language first used to develop the ‘WhatsApp’ we are using? Java No Oracle Sir Don’t know you another name than Oracle? Any guesses? Did you get your seat in third counselling? You have joined pretty late. No for sure! She was noting down every question and answer in the class In my opinion, you are a studious girl He is Aa.. Anand Her Name I don’t know Geeta Instead of writing the answer in the notebook, you should have said it aloud in the class You have a smile for everything. Canteen? No. Library! So…the girl you were searching for ended up in your class Next What do you think happened next? How would I know brother? Do you want to? Don’t you want to tell us? I do! I will get to know about her and tell you in our next show! When the snow falls, all the beauty like you… you create hope on you.. the noise does not stop Is one glimpse enough? To make me lost… The foot leaving the ground… to fly in the air… Oh dear, your walk…like the Niagara falls Your words sounding…like a Telugu tune to the ears Do not hide your heart, out of obligation….Oh partner… Come soon…to meet my dream concealed by my eyes It is like watching the same movie in a loop. One week of my wait is not worth it. I too feel the same brother. This is not the type of girl I was looking for. What were you looking for in a girl then? At that moment we are to meet, why do you keep looking for me That music of silence even before I say a Hi The time I let my heart out, all the naughtiness like me Is following you enough? Do we become one? Is being with you to share your dreams enough… Adding life to a tireless wish… For you to know that I am a walking shadow…not to go back… For me to gift my breath to you! I like your thoughts, but do you find such traits in a girl? Not sure, but life will be good if we can find Is it? How exactly? Hey…Hey…What happened? This feels good… Heart wished for a bit more of something… My world has changed, the time has changed… Changed like this with you… Happiness… your beauty…should be mine… Like those lines in the palm…. You had a nice dream… after that? Geeta… we all are planning a trip to Araku tomorrow. I hope you are coming as well. No Anand. Do you have any plans with your parents? Nope. Will stay home. You can come with us then. Sorry Anand. I don’t like it. Ok. You should not anything you don’t like. Bye! Dreams and Reality are far apart. I wish guys understand this. Next? Who are you? We are... We are thieves aaa We have information that you have lot chocolates and ice creams in store at your home. We just came to steal them. Not lot of them, only two of them. No I don’t trust you. Guys!

Did you add cashew to upma? Good Morning. How did you all come uninformed? Just to give you a surprise. So early in the morning? I did not say anything yet. Your face says, if not you.

Hello Sinka… can you hear me? If we are destined to get what we had desired for, things fall in place. Geeta calling me to check if I had reached safe, Mom picking the call instead, inviting Geeta and liking her as well. Looks like The winds of destiny are towards us! Why do you need all this? Whatever you say or ask, Geeta only has a smile to answer Occasionally comes a little bit of anger I recollected a joke my friend in the US shared me on WhatsApp. Sorry…Sorry Can we also hear the joke? It is a very popular joke in the USA Don’t keep us waiting till the next show for the joke. Why did the Chicken cross the road? Why did the chicken cross the road? Is that a joke? Yes it depends on the answer we think of Coming up is a Megastar remake from Magadheera Why did the chicken cross the road? Rangi…Rangi… Why did the chicken cross the road? I am not sure if she understood the question. Why did the chicken cross the road I say??? Did you start drinking already? You bloody moron! I never knew a joke would evoke such an emotion aaaaaa.... if I asked... why the chicken lays egg? Why don’t you (Anand) tell me the answer bro? To get to the other side To get to the other side? Yes Chicken crossed the road to get to the other side? Thank God, I did not let my inner thoughts out… Geetha Daily over there you can sit here also the people who sat there might have become software engineers the people who sat here became Great Celebrities hey..what do you say?

One Two Three Can we together on my bike? why two bikes? You need to be cognizant of the deteriorating Petrol reserves. What can we do to not endanger our future generations? What can we do? Same College, same bike. We need to step forward towards realizing this goal. The beginning of any great accomplishment is ONE (Person) In this process, I am OK to even travel with you on your scooty Can we go together today at least? Looks like brother got pissed off Bye! Serious… Anand can we go to the beach? When it comes to females, a male heart melts like ice Serious looks do not really suit you. Cheer up Anand Krishna! Isn’t the sea very bewitching on a full moon day? Yes, and I am seeing you for the second time on such an occasion Second time? When was the first time then? In my dreams. I am serious Geeta. I had imagined a Girl like you, like this...on full moon night beautiful sea wearing a white dress and gazing at the moon. I could not believe my eyes when I had first seen you for real. I kept staring at you Yes, you were staring at me? Did you also see me that day? Yes, for the second time Second? Where was the first? You were going past our house This is for sure his deed. The guy above must have done this The guy above…who? who else...God I was minding my way when he diverted me towards your home. It is okay that he did, but he showed me to you and not vice-versa. He had left you to my imagination and when I finally found you, he made me search every nook and corner of Vizag. When I almost left my hope that you were for real he made you stand by side with a smile on your face. he made you sit beside me with smile...to convey all this to you What else does he have in stock for me? What else! He wants you to go home You should not have let that moment gone. That was the best situation What for? Expressing your love So soon? How many more days do you need? It is not about days, just to understand what does she think about me For you know that, first she should know that you love her No way one will know about your love other than letting them know Let he know brother. You anyways have to do it one fine day If not for Surya proposing her, Paddu would have never known Telugu women are very intelligent. They make you tell them how much you love them. No woman would reject a guy like you True Krish! She will definitely say a yes Wow... Super who else like us..except our friends Krish! we are the number one show in Vizag and out listener count is half a million now Brother, what have you decided? Such things are easier said than done What a Following For this Fake Story!.. Unbelievable Are you still assuming this is fake ? What have you decided Krish? Does Geeta listen to FM? No clue When are you proposing her? Do it brother. You will have to do it anyway Anand always has his plans. We do not have to worry What are you thinking? Geeta is elder to me How can a girl from the same batch be elder to you? She is 1 year elder to me Such petty things do not matter, as long as you like Geeta Thank you mom! Poets weave a thin cloth for you with their golden imaginative threads… painters bestow divinity to the shape… The sea offers her pearls… mines give you gold… Spring forests gift their pretty flowers for your decoration What can I give you? The smile on your lips when you see me and a never-ending happiness if you wish so… I Love you Geeta! Hai When did you come to India? 2 days She is in your room. She does not want to go with he mom I will stay with you Let’s go No! Wait! What do you think about yourself? Can you find a guy better than Anand? What do you girls need basically? Listen to Krish on Radio City. You will understand what you are missing Geeta does not like her little sweetheart going Sorry Krish! We should not have forced you as you said...we should have waited for some time Without the girl having any liking the reply will be the same whenever you propose She prefers you as a good friend than a lover All these girls are like this They need college students to hang around, but software engineers to marry Don’t we have the right to think even? We do not ask you go jump into the sea for you to think about it it is just a love proposal You men never were able to understand us Can you all please stop your nonsense? why do you leave the main point Look Krish, there is no guy in Vizag who never had failed in love and never had Mansion House. Let me know if you need company You are 100% correct brother 1 week of spend for a girlfriend can give us one full year of Vodka! Krish knows where exactly to stop What is the kick, had the girl accepted his love? Krish... I just send Primetime Proposal to the head office Now tell me, isn’t there anything called love failure? It’s Seenu Yes, there is nothing called Love Failure Didn’t your girlfriend reject your love proposal I was rejected, not love Did not get you! what is there not to understand? Love never fails A statement that love does not fail is not enough, you need to elaborate How do I explain him? This is precisely the reason why a show should always go as per a script and not with improvisations You will hit such dead-ends! ‘Love does not fail’ – it is just a logical thought and I am not sure if Seenu has the maturity to understand this. Let us see if Krish has the courage to explain this to the audience understanding… let's see... this story turns which way I will try to explain this to you. Tell me one thing, did you meet the girl after she had rejected you? No Why? How can we meet again after she rejected on my face? Ok, so you just started drinking after that? You did not allow me to die, what else can I do then? If your love is so eternal, instead of binge drinking, did you bother to ask her the reason for her rejection even? It is easier said than done brother. Did you ask your lover? I would not have advised you without myself deciding to ask Why late then? Go and ask her Super decision Krish! Go and talk to her Just think over it Krish You will never know if you keep thinking. Go and ask her Krish Don’t act in haste, they are just trying to provoke you Don’t listen to these women This is just the twist I like. Krish..I will be waiting for the next show Not that you should not ask... your friendship should not be spoilt by doing so No harm in him expressing his love You just need to explain him the reason for your rejection Looks like Krish does not have the right experience in dealing with girls. She had left him without saying anything and now she will slap him! Do you think that I need to change myself Geeta? I am sure there must be something wrong in me for a friend like you to reject. Is it because that I am younger to you? If so, I am the unluckiest guy in the whole of Vizag. I do not have goal for myself…friends…parties…. why will you even adore me? Did I say anything about the reason? Why do you make yourself less I could only think of these Geeta There are not the reasons and in fact you are not the reason Why don’t you read Bhagavad-Gita every morning instead of spending time on those books? You do not stop doing this and she does not stop giving you an earful either! 6 Years after our marriage, I was reading this ‘Geetanjali’ when your mom came and whispered the news of your arrival. I could not get enough of my ‘Geetanjali’s’ smiles and read enough of Ravindranath’s ‘Geetanjali’ ever since Geeta, day after tomorrow is an auspicious day. Step into your college at 7:10 AM sharp They don’t even open the college gate by then I told you not to prefer such colleges. Why do you have to go that far for such a college? Ok mom! I will try and request the watchman to open the gate or at least put my foot in from around the corner You both never take my words seriously Mom I think your mom does not like you going so far The only train is half an hour late. What can we do now? Maybe a cup of coffee will do! with beautiful green grass fields.... reed bed as the roof of the huts.... with the misty surroundings..... our beautiful village...like a Pretty Girl One coffee please! with traditional rangolis..... and marigolds all around.... accompanied by the fields of Red chillis.... ready for our festival Madam coffee!

If it is about love, let me help! We have been trying for 3 years.What will you do? Is he handsome? That is the issue! I cannot utter anything when I see him and I come back Why do YOU have to say it? However handsome guys might be, not more than us. They should forget themselves and stare at us. You do not have to go to him. Just stand in front of him and maintain eye contact. Do not bother about anyone else near you. Boys know very well why a girl does that. See you in the party! Hai How did you know that I am here? I am a pretty girl and I know where the poets are Who told you that I am a poet? No need for someone to tell me. I can figure it out just like that as easy as having an ice-cream I am not a poet You can still have the ice-cream Who is that? I will check Is this how your guys thrown stones into a girl’s house? I am not sure, I have never done that how can you? there are no stones on the streets in America Come Lets Have Coffee I cannot… in this cold I knew, I knew you would say this On a cold morning in Ooty, if a girl invites you for a coffee… do you know what the stalwart Sri Sri had said? What would he say? I got it in a piece of paper so that I do not miss out on the flow. ‘Coffee is calling…another cup of coffee is calling… go ahead...go forward...towards the cafe nearby all you lazy, lethargic, aged brothers… you die… I am going out for a coffee with my girl’! Who is that…die, jump? What do you write in your diary? You say you are not a poet and you keep writing something. Who are you? Prakash Who is Prakash? Won't you say? something...in the diary...There is something I got it. I know all your secrets are in this diary! I will get to know everything and return it safe Ok You are the sky I am your cloud.. You are the happiness And I am your smile… I am time with all the seasons… Bore fruit today for you…. I am the fun from a trickling cold breeze… Shall I tickle you…without a momentary gap… I will slip by your looks into your lap… Will become a baby… I cannot stop myself in your company… Will be a waterfall… Shall I be a woodfire in the cold mist… Touching your body gently… Shall I be the little drizzle in the hot summers… Making you wet all over… Shall I play the whole day jumping here and there…Shall I run… On those evenings after a tiring day… Should I be the soothing lilly… The man who designed Java is… Are you even listening? Mmm Tell me who designed Java? Did you even understand the question? Aren’t there any options Sir? Get Up Do you know the answer or not? You are here to study and not to day dream!

Come on babe…let’s rock! Murthy Sir Please let Prakash know that I came here… Please Tell Sir.. Sir…Sir One Two Three Ohhhh... Guess the party went well The had to spend a bomb. They will never invite me a person like me. It would have been good if you had joined as well. I kept two chocolates aside for you anyways Take it Thank you shall I accompany you to the hostel? Did you really come to India for filming a movie? Why did you even get that doubt? Do you know what does an American guy like you who wants to film the spring night and snow filled moonlight as a love story would do to a pretty girl like me? What does he do? Don’t you know? I do not know as well. I got a bit greedy and had my tummy full, can we sit and talk? Let’s go What should we do, man with the dimples? How long would you stare at me like that? Don’t you know why a girl gets close to you? Oh God, looks like I have to train him to kiss. holding like thissssss..... Ohhhhhh... Ohhh....

I am saying this for your own good, you are not on the right path What happened? Did Anjali come to the class? It is not my job to track who came to the class and who did not Tell her that I wanted to meet her What does a boy ask a girl he newly met, as a first thing? We may or may not find what we are searching for… if you keep searching at the same place Hello! Hai! Who? What does a boy ask a girl he newly met, as a first thing? Prakash Where are you? Temple Temple? Didn’t you go to the college? I did not Why? I had to apologize for the mistake I did What mistake? For having those alcoholic chocolates! That’s ok, God will consider your apologies I keep saying that you have a smiling face and just about the time when she is expected you have become dull She? That lady in the traditional dress with a fog dupatta! Is it? Why is she coming now? To confirm if I had said the truth Why does she have to come this far just to see if I was smiling or crying? When is she coming? I warned you not come towards my room Prakash asked me to Exams notification is out. The person who offered you a seat here should be blamed. How was the journey sister? It went well Murthy. Hai Anjali! My sister Hai sisterinlaw Traditional dress, fog dupatta… that was you right? Will you let her in first? Sure Brother What do your parents do Anjali? Dad is a professor in Andhra University and Mom is a homemaker Do your parents know about Prakash? His likes and everything about him? Everything? His cinema dreams, not everyone will be comfortable with that Why will they not like cinema? Everyone likes to watch movies, but they do not quite like people pursuing it as a career Dad has respect Literature and Artists. They will never say no to my likes. Will your mom and dad like me, given that I can only watch movies and not make them? We lost our parents when we were kids. Prakash and I were brought up by our brother in law Do not feel bad. I will adapt you all and then you will have a family. Give me that little one as my dowry What dowry? Oh, don’t you know this? The trend of late is that girls take dowry instead of giving that too..you are from film Industry Why are you laughing sis? Anjali wants this little one as her dowry Dowry? Nice girl! Someone!... Someone!.... exaggerated! Who are you? The dream or the art…! Who are you? The shining in the daylight…! Careless fun... Summer lilly’s look a like… Venue for a celabration…!

Who are you? The dream or the art…! Who are you? The magic changed its form to you… Met me the other day…chasing me all over… Another world touched the heart gently… Should I seek you in the presence of these moments… Why do you have to go now?

I have nothing to do there now, will give you guys a send-off at the station and will go back Why are you not saying anything? I will get down at ‘Mettupallayam’ and head back. don’t believe me, right? No, we do! How can you be so good all the time? It is not always smiling, you should also show your anger when needed as well Booked the cab. You will get a call on your mobile. Call me as soon as you reach Ooty I will be waiting for you. Come back soon! Over! It’s all over! I was always worried that this would happen! What happened sir? We do not have any other show for the No: 1 slot. He ended the story and there is nothing to listen to in this show from tomorrow We do know what to say Krish. Should we feel happy that her love was a success or should we feel bad that your love failed? All the girls are the same. They do not let you know anything till you are drowned That girl’s behaviour was weird from the beginning itself! Attempt was never made to understand that girl properly.That is the problem. We understand your pain. She is your friend and friend can only understand a friend’s love Oh god! A friend should understand a friend’s love? Who will understand a lover’s love then? See Krish, this is quite common now a days! Leave it.We will find a new lovely girl The right advice in time. Krish, do not worry any more about this Yes Krish, those you just advised you now cannot think of more Can you please stop the crap? You look for chances to fight with each other. Whose problem is this? Krish’s or yours? What should we do now? Hello, Radio City! Sir, why is Krish not picking up the call? Krish just left Krish left? The show it still on right? Yes, but there is nothing else to say. It’s all over All over? Hello… Hello… Hello… What should i say to the listeners if you leave suddenly like this? I did not see the time Sir Hmmm...ok. What are you planning for today's show? It is only your love and affection that placed the show at the No: 1 spot For it to continue like that, let us start our show today with a fresh topic. How about childhood love? childhood love Let's see who our fresh caller is Hello... I don’t have any childhood stories However, i have my doubts on the your story. Not just me, in fact most of the listeners. I do not deny the reason she gave to reject your love... but...how did she land in Vizag from Ooty? What happened to the guy who went to Ooty to script his movie? And last but not the least, May be it was only a 'story' she told just to reject you? Yes! You are not as dumb as i thought Seenu! Those were just the right questions, keep them coming ! We are at the climax brother. Clarify our doubts so that we can start with a new topic Serious? Is it because i travelled against your wish? Did you express your liking for me at least once? I really like you Anjali Let it be! You don’t have to pretend just because I asked you. I think it is only a one way thing from my side every time i used to roam around you..this time also True that you like me more than I do, but I am the first to like you. Had you stayed for another moment that day, I would have said how much I liked you. I did not want to lose that happiness by expressing…. What is that happiness and why would you lose it? You coming for me every day looking around for me if I was not there… those ice-creams, chocolates, small fights with Murthy and many more to say… Many girls are blessed with such happiness, but it is only me who is blessed with Anjali! Can’t you see? he came upon us sir... Where are you going? Looks like that they got hurt Sorry sir. Please don’t… Don’t worry, I just came to check if you need any help No worries Sir, I did not see you at the turning…Sorry Sir Take Care Thank You Sir Hey Prakash, you were doing something…Leave me Leave me…Prakash What did you ask me to do then? Please..Leave me… Let me be like this for a while, I like it… Anjali came out of coma after 2 months Keep her in observation for 24 hours and keep me updated every hour I saw you somewhere. In my dream! God.. where did you find this inncocent guy? What did the doctor say uncle? They will discharge her tomorrow Have Have some food Geeta Eat...I Will How long will I have to ask you like this? It is really tiring How long will you be like this? Please have some food Prakash is an innocent guy. I am the one who chased him…and killed him I also want to die.... She is Not listening to us Knowing that it was not you, saying that you are responsible for it is stupidity. Small Girl...she understood when we said How do I explain you and how many times? We are leaving to the US and we will never come back to you Geeta Prakash is not going to come back irrespective of what you do. Say ‘bye’ to Akka darling Bye Akka! No one wants to be with me If you be like this for long, you will go away from yourself Are you also leaving me Darling? Have something Anjali. We cannot change the past, we have to change ourselves The earlier you recover, the better for you I cannot resist my tears. I can imagine her plight We do not have words to console you Krish Looks like she had revealed her past only to say ‘No’ to Krish Not necessary that rejecting Krish was the reason Why don’t we ask Krish himself to clarify? Krish, tell us the truth. Why did she reveal her past to you? Tell us Krish Tell us Krish Tell us Krish Tell us Krish Tell us Krish Tell us Krish Tell us Krish Will you all kill him if he doesn’t tell you? He should think of something now We do not have time left for the show…Please Silence! Silence! Silence is all I get from her. That is the only answer for all my questions. She told me everything and then it is all silence. I have to find my answers in that silence… We do not get what you say Krish What is there to be confused about, she indirectly said ‘No’ When did she? When did she say that she does not like Krish? What else can we infer from her silence? Silence is half acceptance, may be? May be it was, in the good olden days. Now, silence means you go and die your death Have you started it again? Stop Krish, all of them are thinking in their point of view and advising you accordingly. Leave aside her silence, what is your decision? It is not what I decide, it is what the destiny does. How did a fictitious story I told to save someone’s life turned real in my life? What did she lose Prakash whom she loved immensely? Why did it(destiny) get her closer to me and why is it taking her away? Why did it make me so indecisive? Anand, Mom come home Ok mom Are tears hindering your vision.. Are they darkening your world..? Clueless on where to head to.. Is vaccum travelling along..? Is the merciless time pushing you to a devastation? Oh heart…Oh heart… I am at your mercy now… Oh heart…Oh heart…it is all because of you! All the unfulfilling memories Should I touch them frequently The little time we were together Should I treasure it for the whole life Strong belief that you would never go past me… Such is that love… The reason why… the thought of you not being here…is not any near… I do understand what you say. It is difficult for us to know what she has in mind, it is very difficult for a person to speak in geetha's condition You cannot even ask her You did whatever you could and irrespective of whatever happens you to be as a friend....or love her forever you said what you needed to say..she will think about herself along with these..you have a life thinking about this..don't spoil your life Uttering your name in my sleep…. All the dreams I come across are yours! All the marks on my heart did not fade away… How can I get wet in a new raining love? Moist eyes haven’t dried yet… How can I reach a new dream destination? Accept… and go away from my past.. Reject….and stay in my yesterday? at night....leaving all the moonshine shall i go towards the sunshine.... Dad, that I had always wanted and... that i had always wanted to stay with me… left me forever in a moment! Something which I never expected and someone who is younger to me came into my life, and now his life is being ruined as well. What kind of a life is this? A human life runs itself through various phases, Geeta. Dreams tears, unexpected happiness, unforeseen sorrow, unforgettable memories, unbreakable relations…. they all touch your heart and go…like those waves do. Some hit us hard and their impact lasts longer. It is important that we recover from such jolts and move ahead. All you need to think now is what your heart want and what kind of a future are you looking forward to. Your likes and choices are the ones which would create a future for you. Move… Oai...Anand Krishna..move aside May I know the intension behind this, Ms. Gadde Geetanjali? All those who sat and studied here later became big celebrities I do not understand these girls!
