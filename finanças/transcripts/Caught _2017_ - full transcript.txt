Hold up there, Toby! Your art project. Remember, Friday treats are for Friday afternoons, not Monday mornings, all right? All right, come here. Off to school, now. Bye-bye, mum. Andrew, you up there? I'm out back. Come and have a look at this. Foxes again? That, or it's the pixies after your old knickers. Ha ha, very funny. Toby made it off to school OK? He's late again, we're going to get a call from the school, Look, nightmares are normal at his age, Julie. Sign of an active imagination. There's nothing wrong with him. Hey, did I say there was? No, but his teacher seems to think there is. Did you see his comments about the story Toby wrote? The scarecrow in the closet with the black eyes! Well, Mr. Barton is a tosser. Anyway, blame the foxes for last night. Their cries probably woke him up. That would have set him off. Gave me quite a start when they got going. That just shows where he gets his imagination from. Foxes only scream when they want to mate. And no, that will not work for you. Hello? Hi. We're both beavering away. It's Jeff. Hopefully a week. Two at tops. Yes, that's right. No, I mean it this time. It's early days, but we've had an idea for another story. Maybe for the Sunday paper? Yes, another local story. There's something going on up on the Moors near us, near the Gentleman Jim site. Yes, Jeff the Killer. Anyway, the army's up to something. Blocking off a whole section of the moors, and we've seen some pretty heavy-duty lorries It looks like they're setting up a new base. Yeah, I know, but why here? The last time anyone invaded here it was in 1066. No, they're not answering any questions. No, I doubt it's got anything to do with the missing woman. My thinking is it's for nukes, otherwise why the secrecy? You don't think painting a bloody great in the middle of one of the most beautiful places in England... is a story? It's just Heath pretending we're some kind of superpower. But yes, they especially shouldn't be in bloody Kintry, a couple of miles from my kids! The phone. Look, Julie's here, wants to speak to you. Yes, you. Tory wanker. Hi, Jeff. No, he's just a bit tired. Toby had a nightmare last night, woke us all up. Look Jeff, you'll be happy to know we're off the Gentleman Jim story. This one's bigger. Yes, definitely bigger than Burma. Look, Andrew's taken some good photos Let him print them and send them to you, and I'll keep digging, see what I can find. I think this story could play well, especially for older readers. No, I really do. Well, have a look and see what you think. OK, great. Love to Mary. Bye-bye now. Well, that could have gone better. Fuck him. There's more than one editor in London. You hear him? Bastard called me a nimby. He's teasing. It's Jeff. He likes you, he wouldn't call if he didn't care. I know, I know. What is it? I'm not sure. They're probably just Jehovah's Witnesses. Yeah, the sign that Kintry is finally on the map, when the religious nut jobs turn up. The Gentleman Jim book was a mistake. But we'll start earning money again soon. What's our motto? Pick up whatever we find. And there's a story up there on the moors. And when we get to the bottom of it, Jeff will be begging for it and we get double the money, and you know it. You know I love you, don't you? Yes, yes I do. Even if you did let me talk you into that bloody book. Don't worry, never again. God's sending them in our direction. Here they come. What, you don't want to be converted? Shit, the bloody doorbell. Just in the nick of time. Worried you were going to wake the baby. So, can I help you? We have all the religion we need at the moment. But if you're looking for a donation... Have you spoken to Kay? Sorry? His name is Mr. Kay. Have you spoken to him before we came? I really have no idea what you're talking about. I'm sorry, which organization are you with? Watchtower? Jehovah's Witness? We've come from Kintry Moor. We want to speak to you. We have questions for you and your wife. Are you sure you have the right people? Yes. We were looking for you. It's about th-the... Project. Hello. They're from the base, up on the Moors. Want to speak to us about what's going on up there. Ask us a few questions. Ask us questions? Well, I don't know. Um. Will it take long? No. Not long. Well, I think we can manage to answer a few questions. Please, come in. Andrew, why don't you take them to the living room, and I'll make some tea. Sure. Come in, Mr..? Blair. We are Mr. and Mrs. Blair. Please, sit down. Your shoelace. It's undone. Your shoelace. It's undone. We're sorry. We will take of this, in time. I'm just going to go and see how the tea's coming on. Back in a second. I'm going to tape over the giant farmer, OK? Those people in there seriously fucking weird! I felt more comfortable when the Burmese army were pointing Did you hear their names? What, Blair? Yes, it's fake! They're hiding something, something great. Let's just try and get them out of here as quickly as possible. OK, fine. Where should I put this? Um, that one. Yeah. Andrew said you're based on the Moors? Yes, the Moors. And we're the only people you're speaking to. Yes, just you. We came to speak to you. Doesn't that make us feel special? Tea? Tea? Or, or would you prefer coffee? I can make coffee as well, if you'd prefer that. No. This is your house, your decision. Tea it is! Coffee's not very good anyway. We hardly ever drink it. Here you go, darling. It's hot. Hot. We should ask you the questions now, if you're hot enough. If you have finished becoming hot, we should start. I'm very interested to hear what you'd like to know. Would it be possible for us to ask you a few questions ourselves, when you're finished? That depends what you tell us. We will know that when we are finished here. Fine. Write down the answers to your questions? No, we will remember. Right. You are Mr. and Mrs. Costello. Yes, of course. Complete names? I'm, Julie, well, Juliet. And... I'm Andrew. What age are you each? 35. 32. How long do you live in Kintry? This is my parent's house... Well, it was my parent's house. They died a few years ago and, well, we just settled here, with our family. I remember "Bridge over Troubled Water" was number one in the charts. You know, Simon and Garfunkel? Andrew, do you have a mother or father in Kintry? My mother lives in London, and my father passed away. He died when I was 10. Do you have any children? Look, I thought you were here to ask us about Kintry Moors. Yes, we will ask you that next. Yes, we have two children, um, Emily and Toby. This. This? This. It's a photograph. I took it. To... took. Do you like it? I do not decide. Stand away. Sit down. Now I will ask of Kintry Moors. How often do you go there? We go out there all the time. One of the reasons we moved here. It's quite... it's quite a view from up there, don't you think? It's a great spot for picnics, if it's not too windy. That's why we were sad when the Army fences went up. Cuts into the scenery. Did you copulate on the Moors? What did you just say? Did you fuck on Kintry Moors? All right, I've had enough of this. Is this some kind of sick joke? OK. Get out of... Emily. I said get the fuck out of my... aah, aah! She has killed all ready, she will kill again. Don't be the first today, Mr. Costello. Now, I will finish my questions. If we answer your questions will you please leave our house? We never said we would leave. You will tell me. When does Toby become here? Everyone is needed here. Now, we will wait til Toby becomes here. Cover. Cover! Light. Light! Done. When does Emily stop making the noise? She won't stop until I go up there. She means she needs to go upstairs to stop Emily crying. Don't you understand that? Christ! Who the hell are you people? We are... we are from the Kintry Moors. We are persons of Kay. We are Kay. Please, just let my wife go upstairs to see to Emily. Stop her crying. She won't try to run. Will you, sweetheart? Good. You watch him. I will go with her. You do not want Mrs. Blair to go up there. It would be bad thing. Recognize. Mistake. Bad decision. She will... Who are you? Who are you, really? I am Kay. Who are you? Shh, shh, shh. You were here last night, weren't you? Bastard. Toby heard you. I watch. We watch. No make the noise. Stop. Please. Please just leave our house. No. I am begging you now. Please just go. Not complete. Sorry I was rude to you back there. I shouldn't have sworn at you. You don't look well, Mrs. Blair. Can't you let us help you? We'll cooperate, really. I don't decide! How long? However long it takes, Mr. Blair. She'll drift off again when she's ready to, not before that. Baby's aren't machines. They don't have off switches. The question. You didn't answer it. Which question? When does Toby become here? When does he come home? Why do you need to know that? You will be complete. I will be complete. He comes home after school. Around 3 o'clock. Sometimes half past. Is that a long time from now? Jesus. Who are you people? Is this an act? Look, I understand maybe there are things you can't tell us. But please, I have got to know what this is about. What is it exactly that you want? I just... I want you gone from here. You know what it is. You know why we are here, Mrs. Costello. No, no I don't. You need to tell me. You do know. You were on... They can hear the baby, they'll know someone is in. Who is they? Is they Toby? I don't know who they is, but they will get suspicious if I don't go down there, and then they will go get the police to check on Emily. Either way, you are fucked. Go downstairs. Speak to the other person. Make them leave. Do not say we are here, or I will take your baby and I will remove her head. You will see. If Mr. Costello draws in the other, I will kill your baby, then I will kill you. You will see. Put the baby back in... ... object. Go down there quickly. I will be here, with your baby. Do this now. Sorry about this, Julie, but there's no way I'm getting this through your letter box. - Hello Sam. That's not a problem. Yeah, one minute it's raining, next minute it's shine! Never guess it's England, would you? Still, all part of being on Her Majesty's service. I'm sorry that was me, weren't it? Don't worry, Sam. She's been at it all night. I know what they're like at that age, I got three of my own. Well, my wife has, you know. I did the easy part. Well, anyway I'll better let you get up to his lordship. I mean, ladyship. At this point I really don't know. Right. Righty-o. Sorry, love. Nearly forgot. You got to sign for this one. Right Where do I...? Just print your name there, and sign there. Is everything all right, Mrs. Costello? I'm sorry, it's just been a very long night. I, better get back up to her lordship. Yeah, ladyship, yes. Fine. Well, tuck her in tight. Bye, Sam. Sam, Sam. Sam! Sam! Sam, no! No! Stop! Stop it! No! Watch. Watch! Sam! Sam! Please, stop! Christ, Julie, what happened? No, Andrew, don't. They... she killed Sam. What? Out there. She's still... It's my fault, Andrew. He was just doing his job. Came to deliver that poster we ordered. When I signed, I... I wrote a note asking for help. And now he's dead, and it's all my fault. He has three children, he just told me. No. She would've killed him anyway. Emily! Shh! Emily's safe. She's sleeping upstairs. The man let me feed her, but won't let me bring her downstairs. He... he nearly said something, before Sam came. I, I just... I just don't understand why they're here. They're just crazies. Like the Charlie Manson gang. We were just fucking unlucky to be here when they came. No. I don't think that's it. He said they've been watching us. They just... they can't... they can't communicate properly. Yes, because they're fucking crazy! No, it... it's as if they are, like... A bit like children. They're obviously not stupid, but they don't know anything. At first I thought it was a tactic, to try and scare us, intimidate us. That they were from the new base built. Now I'm certain it isn't an act. So what's interesting about us? If they're not crazy, if this isn't about the base, then what else? Unless it's Berma. Berma? After all this time? We made enemies over there, remember that. They could've come here to pressure us. What was that noise? It comes from you. Nothing. Give me the noise maker. Just give it to him. If you try to run, I will catch you. I will finish one of you. If you bring others I will finish the baby. Get the fuck out of our house. If you attack me, I will reveal. And you will not understand. What the fuck are you talking about? Just fuck off! Stop. Stop. Stop it! Sit down. Stand up now. Bad actions will happen if you do not. What the fuck do you want from us?! You know. You know! You were there. We know what you saw, but you refuse it! Fuck you! Are you OK? It's OK. It's going to be all right, I promise you. They're going to kill us! They haven't done it yet, have they? Maybe if we figure out what it is they want. Let me out, you fuckers! I swear, if that fucking woman touches her I will kill you! Open this fucking door now! You made noise stop from baby. Because she's alone, and afraid, and she needs me! Please let me out! No. You have to talk. Say what you have done, then go to baby. If I do that, if I talk to you, tell me everything I know, will you please let us out? And get Emily, take care of her. You may go to baby. Then bring it back down. Then you talk. If you do not answer questions, more harm will happen. OK. Fine, just... now open the door. You will go upstairs with Mrs. Blair. See to baby. Switch off. No. I'll go up and bring Emily down. Julie will stay, talk to you about what you want to know. Once baby is quiet, then bring down. Not before that. Go. Sit. When does Toby return? Why are you so interested in Toby? Toby here, you will not run. You are here. You don't need Toby for that. You don't have to threaten us, we will do anything you ask. Not. No. Look, if you have questions about what we know, ask me. Or Andrew. Anything! OK? When is Toby? About one hour. New? Soon. Please, when he comes, just... Just don't hurt him. Bring him to me and I'll keep him quiet, he won't trouble you. And then I'll tell you everything you want to know. I will decide what is everything, not you. I can't help you if I don't know what it is you need to know! You have seen. You catch. You. Your husband. You. Catch. You caught. I and Mrs. Blair, we were sent to make... To find caught. Sent by who? The distant. They will be here. When? Soon. Who are they? You already know. You caught them. Soon, they will caught you. This is about the Moors, isn't it? About what we saw there. Caught... Photos. Is that it? The pictures Andrew took. We haven't even printed those yet. If we show you those photos, you will go, right? Right? When you first came here, you said answer my questions. Yes. Will you? No. You come to my house? You beat me, beat my husband. You killed Sam, you... What is Sam? Fuck you! Fuck you. You heard me, you bastard. Sam is that man, out there, in God knows what state. That's Sam. A dead man. A man you killed. She did that. Well that's all right then. You're in the clear. Would you mind awfully fucking off, then? I just... I just want you gone from here, I just... I just want to go. Ask. What? Ask your question. I will not answer if it is bad. OK. Would you... no, wait. OK. Who is they? Who is coming? They are the... Those who decide. They are real. Without clothes. The distant. So, wait. You're not real. No. What are you then? Them. I don't understand. I am not them. I am Kay. I am also them. We are Kay. You, and the woman. You and Mrs. Blair. Yes? Yes. Just... What exactly is going to happen when they come? I do not understand. They, no, I... I mean, them. When them get to the house. What will happen? You will be questioned. We will be questioned. We will go. Wait. When you say, "We will go." Are you going to go, or do you mean... Emily! Hi, darling! Baby. we did and we just didn't notice it, but you were taking photos. And this has nothing to do with the fucking army base! To just sit back and wait until Toby gets back home and they do God knows what with him? Why do you just never mark anything with a date or a name?! How do find anything? Please, Andrew. Help me. You didn't see what they did to Sam. We have to hurry. All right. Found them. I'll have to blow them, and print them. Otherwise, we'd have noticed at the time. How long will that take? You know how long. There's no quick way to do these things. And there's no guarantee we'll find anything anyway. If there is a chance of finding something to make them go, we've got to take it. You go and listen out for Toby. Mom, Dad, I'm back. Toby. Mom? You have to get out of the house, now. Go get help. Just go! You have to trust me sweetheart. Please, you have to do as I say, hurry. Mummy, you're scaring me, I don't understand! There are bad people in this house Toby, you have to get out. G- go, go! Toby? Toby, are you still there? Toby! Complete. Bastards! Sick, evil, bastards! Do not understand, but do avoid trouble. Now, you help us. You admit. You caught. Yes, yes. I caught. I have your fucking caught! Where is the caught? I'll find it, and bring it to you. But you must let my family go! Family? Yes, my family. Them. No. Family stays. You bring that is caught. Then, then we questions. Yes, we talk. Caught! Caught. Talk. Did you see how the woman is falling apart? Both of them? You see their eyes? Yes. And? And what? What do you think? I mean, what the hell are they? Julie, if I stop and think about that now, I'll go bloody crazy. Let's just submit they're not Mr. and Mrs. Blair. Do you think... What? If they're falling apart, do you think that we could, you know, stand up to them? They were too strong before, but maybe now, we could... I don't know, Julie. We don't know anything about them. Who, what they are. Perhaps they're turning into something else. Maybe something even stronger. The amount of noise these bastards have made. They're all out at work. They won't be back for ages yet. Come on, not everyone. What about... Tina. Tina's around all the time. Her daughter's sick, remember? Sam. Surely they'll send out the police to ask about him. Maybe. They'll probably think he's just nipped off to the pub, and got hammered. Anything? No. And this is the last one. Nothing. Nothing at all. Julie? Sooner or later, they're going to check back in on us. What in God's name are we going to do if we've got nothing to show them? No caught. There's nothing here. I've printed every single one, and nothing fucking here! I don't know what I'm more afraid of. Finding something, or not finding something. What's that? Must have missed one. What the fuck? My God. Mom, what's happening? They're just bad people, sweetheart. They're bad people who think mom and dad saw something we shouldn't have. And we didn't know what they meant, but now we do. So, once we explain, then they'll leave from here, OK? This is what they want, Toby. Exactly this. I'll show it to them and they'll go away. What is it? It's a photo of the bad people. They're doing bad things and they don't want to be caught. Like Charlie, at school. Yes, that's right. Like Charlie at school. They're just bullies. And like all bullies, they're scared, and stupid, and they're frightened of being caught. It's OK. Andrew. It's going to be all right, isn't it? Of course. Look after them, OK? Yeah. We'll get through this. You. Yes, it's me. I've got your proof. Your caught. I've got your caught. Caught. Yes. So what happens now? You come out. And I and you talk. Will you let Julie and the children go? You and I talk. OK. Now. Come. Andrew. Come! Sit. The caught, there. This. This? It is...? A Dictaphone. Dictaphone. Records voices. People speaking. It captures voices. Julie uses it for work. She used it on you. Caught. Voices. This. I don't know what's inside it. I'd have to open it. A poster, that's all. We ordered it from a gallery after an exhibition we'd been to. They were out of stock. Julie liked it. She thought it... Sam died because of this stupid fucking poster. Like it? No. This. It is...? It's a cassette deck. Cassette deck. Noi... noise. Not noise. Music. It plays music. People like to listen to music to fucking relax. Enjoy them-fucking-selves. And. That's my son's schoolwork. Art project. That's right. Art project. Although I suspect you've seen that before. All right. You want to see inside. There. See? Drawings of animals. You happy? You prick. My son loves to draw. Terrible job of it. He loves to fucking draw. OK? Caught. Yes. This is what it's all about, right? Before I show you, I want you to promise you'll let my family go. Show this. Will you promise? Show this, or I will remove your head from your body. And listen. I got all the negatives as well. There are no other copies. You take these, the negatives, everything, and there will be no proof that you ever here. OK? You have my word. You understand? You'd know that nobody would believe me even if I told them everything I've seen, everything you've done. You can go now, and nothing will happen to you. Please, will you just take these and go! What? There! Caught! Look, we were just taking photos of that new army base that suddenly appeared at the edge of the Moors. We wanted to know why it was there. We didn't know anything about you. We weren't even looking for you, but we caught you, by mistake! We didn't even know we had until just now! This! Caught! You and them! We have nothing to do with those soldiers, or the government! We're just fucking journalists! We were photographing them, not you! You! Argh! Don't. You saw it. Andrew! My God! My God, I thought... Toby. Can you go see to your sister? I think she needs her big brother right now. Can you do that for me? Yeah. Good, son. Andrew. They're going to kill us. I know that now. My God, they're going to kill us. What was that? The woman, I think. She's calling them, isn't she? Yes. Yes, I think so. You look great in this shirt. Why'd you throw it away? You threw it out. The had holes. Andrew. We have any chance of getting out of this? Any chance, at all? I don't know. They think we're connected to the soldiers, somehow. I tried to explain, but... Hello. Forgive me. Come on, Toby. Hold the baby tight. You got her? I'm so proud of you. Why noise? We have more photos to show you. More caught. We mean it this time. Can prove we're not with those soldiers. Just open the door, and let us out. I've got them right here, OK? Run, Toby! Run! Run, Toby! Run! No!
