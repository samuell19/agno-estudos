Oh, I'm sorry. I thought you were hungry. Crazy me. Okay, bye. Where's your sister? Okay, ignore me. But this window is staying open for the length of a coffee, and then you're stuck outside for the rest of the day. I'm serious. Mr. Spiegleman? Ah, madame gauthier? In the flesh. Nice to meet you. The apartment is on the fourth floor. I did explain that, didn't I? Uh, yeah, you did. You did. Definitely. Well, uh... I think I should be fine. If you say so. You're welcome. My pleasure. Love having a cold apartment. Oh, I can't stay mad at you guys. Spencer? You up? Spencer: Coming! Uh, I, uh... bonjour. - Hey. - Oh, you speak English? Yeah. Hi! That's yesterday's. But there's nothing about the killer. Did you do the crossword? Do I ever? - Victor: Hey. - Hi! I am moving in upstairs. Apartment number 12. Oh, thank god. I thought you were delivering pillows. That would be a weird job. It's so cool that you guys are both English! Uh, sorry, I'm rude. I'm Victor. Nice to meet you. Spencer uh, Louise. Nice to meet you. Okay. Bye. - And there she goes. - Yeah. Well, best of luck with the move there, man. I'd offer to give you a hand, but... I'm lazy. No, what? No, no. Oh, no. I have a brother coming in from Ottawa. I was kidding, Vince. Yeah. Okay. And he's tall, which you know I love. I mean, for me, the perfect height is when you can slow dance and you can rest your head right on his chest. I mean, how fucking hot is that, right? - Pretty hot. - Mmm-hmm. And I never meet guys that tall. And blond, which is nuts. I totally thought blond guys were, like, a myth. I mean, I never see blond guys anywhere. Do you? Oh, and his body. I know he has an amazing body, because at one point I leaned over and I touched his arm, and I swear to god, he had, like, armor on underneath his t-shirt, or something. - Wow! - I know, right? And his name is Roland, which I know you think is probably lame, but I think it's kind of sexy. It's like those old British names, you know. Like he's like the "lord of something," or something. Anyways, he's picking me up after work tonight. Don't you finish at midnight tonight? So? We're going for a late drink. Mmm-hmm. Whatever. I'm not gonna sleep with him. But you will. But he's hot! Have you read the gazette? Is there anything about the serial killer? Oh, my god. Seriously, Louise, there's no serial killer. There's just one dead woman. Three. Dead and raped. Whatever. Are you sure you don't mind? No. Who cares? There's no one here anyways. - Okay. Good night. - Good night! Oh! If you hear from Nathalie, tell her I'm gonna murder her. And rape her? Yes. Hey. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. It's pitch black outside. You're coming home by yourself, and I just leap out and say, "hey." I'm an idiot. I, uh, I'm Victor. We met this morning. Yeah, I remember. I know, it's weird that I'm standing here, but I promise I'm just waiting for my brother to come and help me, because I can't really carry this up to the fourth floor all by myself. I'm so sorry. Stop apologizing. It's fine. I've just been reading too much about the serial killer. You've... what? - You haven't seen that? - Oh! - Wow. This is awful. - Yeah, it's fucked. I had no idea this was happening. Keepit what? Really? Are you sure? - Positive. - Okay, thank you. Tough day? Hmm. Have you spoken to the new guy, yet? No, just this morning. You? He's down in the lobby... With a couch he can't move. Ifeelhke I should help him, but... But what? But I don't want to. That's my girl. Okay, I gotta go feed the cats. Uh, okay. Do you wanna, uh, do you wanna eat something in a bit? No. Bye. I'm good. Victor: Thank you, Louise. You know, it's not really heavy for a pullout. It's just kind of awkward and cumbersome. It's actually my parents' old couch. It's pretty nice of them to give it to me. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. You are the best neighbor in the history of neighbors. Thank you so much. Don't give it another thought. No, listen, I got to make it up to you. Let me cook you supper, take you out to supper, something like that. Sure, when you're settled. Okay. I know. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's just those stupid people with the stupid things they want me to do. Just tonight. And just because you made me feel so bad for being late. Chou: You get stood up? Okay. Bye, Mr. Chou. You should date nicer boys. Oh, hey. How's it going? Good. Good. Um, I still owe you that supper. Oh, don't worry about it. Well, I'm not worried about it. I just, uh, want to make sure I thank you properly. Okay. - Hey. - Spencer: Hello. - Victor: Good morning. - Good morning. Uh, newspaper? Oh, I didn't work yesterday. Hey, big night. Anybody watching the results come in tonight? Because I thought maybe we could, like, I don't know, get together, eat food, see what happens. Bad idea. Never mind. No. Sure. - Dinner. - Yeah. Let's do it here. Hlcook. - Really? - Yeah. Amazing. I'll bring dessert. I'll come. Uh, 7:00-ish? - Whenever. - Okay. Bye. Ah, man, this is gonna be fun. It is. It's gonna be a good time. - All right. I'll see you then. - I'll see you. I'm English. Louise: Just give me one second. What's going on? Johanne”. What about Johanne? Where did she say that she met him? She didn't. I don't know where she goes out. She lives downtown, I think. Did she describe him to you, though? Yeah, but I was barely listening. Um, she said he was blond. Uh, muscular. Tall, I think, or she thought. It really wasn't very specific. And she said his name was? Something stupid sounding. Um... Roland! It was Roland. So do you think this is the same guy that... I mean, the serial killer? What serial killer? Was she raped? Brandt: She was treated poorly. But does this Roland guy, does it sound like the same guy you're looking for? Louise, right? Right. Louise, I want to thank you for your help. If you can think of anything else aboutjohanne, anything at all... Call me. My cellular number is on the back. Mr. Brandt, um, should I be worried? I mean, should I be concerned for my safety? A woman your age should always be concerned for her safety. It's a nasty world. I'm terribly sorry. I didn't even see it. Van ilen: This looks like it'll be quite the feast. Mmm, fennel. I love fennel. I forgot to ask you this when we spoke this morning, but there's no dessert. Should I run out and get something? Company's bringing dessert. Company, eh? So mysterious. My most mysterious patient. That's what I call you. Now, I know you don't want me to mention this again, but I have to because I think it's unconscionable. If you want to vote, it'll take me 10 minutes to get the Van... Thank you, miss Van ilen. Thank you. They can win by one vote. That's what everyone's saying. Miss Van ilen, you make too many assumptions. Just amazing. We could not ask anything more from your musculature, young man. Just amazing. I'm naturally athletic. You certainly are. There's no doubt about that. Gauthier: Hello? Madame gauthier? It's Louise. Oh! Hello, beautiful. Hi. Um, yeah, listen. You know the new guy in the building? Victor? Of course I do. Could I get his number from you? And she called you for his number? So bold. It's different for girls now. They're much luckier than we were. I didn't even know there was a new tenant. He's young. He's Jewish. I always thought her and Spencer... Oh, so did I. So did I. But nothing yet. And now this. So sad. For him. Such a handsome man. So handsome. Almost tragic. So who's he having dinner with? He didn't say. I tried, but he wouldn't budge. He's like a vault, that one. Is that that valérie woman? Probably. She's terrible. She's sad. She's horrible. She drinks so much. Oh, clearly. Courage! I'll let you know what I see. See you soon. Louise: I know it's a bit ridiculous, but it's only a few blocks. 80, um... Anyway, let me know if it's inconvenient or anything. Okay. Thanks. Uh, see you at dinner, either way. Hi, there. Hey. I'm, uh, ah... hey! - Hey! - Am I late? No. Not at all. - You too. - Okay. Oh, make sure someone picks you up. Sorry about that message, by the way. What? Why? It's my honor, my pleasure. Actually, I felt terrible that I hadn't thought of it myself. I mean, there's a serial killer attacking pretty young girls in ndg, and you having to walk home by yourself. That's just crazy. Well, thanks for that. Well, yeah. Victor: Hey! So Louise is just upstairs getting ready. Come on in. So you teach high school? Is that it? Yeah, well, um... Elementary school, actually. - Gotcha. - Yeah. Kind of like babysitting, isn't it? Well, yes, there's an element of that to it. Uh, but one can make a case that it's the most important time in one's life, learning-wise, anyway. Because, technically, your brain will never be as open to sort of new ideas as it is when you're like a little kid. I was kidding. Right. Right. Of course. I'm sure it's very rewarding. Really. I love it. I really do. No, I bet. I bet. And what, what is it? You're just coming back from... Uh, China. Uh, northern China. - Wow. That's crazy. - Yes, it's intense. Were you doing the same thing there? Yeah, pretty much. I guess, there was just a bit more, uh... Chinese? Yeah. Exactly. But you're from here originally, though, right? Yeah. Well, I was born in Ottawa, but, yeah, grew up here in ndg. Really? Welcome back to Canada, then. I mean, for now. Yeah. You know what? That's an idea. That's an idea. Uh... To Canada. For now. I wonder what's taking Louise so long. Oh, she's probably just playing with her pussy. Her cat, man. She's got two cats she's obsessed with. Victor, you can't make it that easy for me. No promises. TV announcer: Will it be yes or no? From Montreal, it's referendum night. Allow me to say something and forgive me if I sound like an asshole. I mean, condescending. I don't wanna sound condescending. I'm just making it worse, aren't I? No, I just... I would like to say... It is inspiring to me to see how... effortless you make everything look. That was a terrible thing to say. I am, uh... oh, my god! I just should never be allowed to speak, and I don't drink very often. I'm drunk. Did madame gauthier already tell you? Tell me what? My story? No. Um, I mean, no. Well, she loves to gossip. So you've been warned. Car accident, last winter. My, uh, my wife died. Jesus. I mean... Wow. That is awful. Yeah. No, it is. The doctors say that I should be able to walk again one day, but, uh, so far so nothing. That's... That is an awful story. Yeah, it is. Spencer, I can't tell you how sorry I am. Why the fuck are you sorry? You didn't do anything. Now, where is Louise? I am starving. Now, look at that. I fished my wish. - Are these guys new? - Spencer: Which ones? The mean looking sharky ones? - Uh, no, I don't think so. - Really? - Well, summer, I think. - Huh. Okay! So... Since someone forgot to bring dessert... Oh, I completely forgot. Bad guest. You know, I can run out to the store right now and grab something. But he still managed to bring two very decent bottles of wine, so... I like wine. I don't drink it very often, but I like to research it, read about it, compare the different... Is he ever gonna stop talking? Sorry. So wine plus wine minus dessert equals coffee, and slightly less of the chocolate than Louise gets, to the power of... Can we please turn off the fucking television? What, now? We don't even know, officially. Oh, yes we do. You won, man. Canada! Woo-hoo. Can we mute it, at least? Yeah, yeah. But, you know, I didn't just win. Like, we all win. - We all win? - Yeah. How'd we all win? Because we're English? No, I... - Can I make a drink-drink? - Of course. - You want something, Victor? - Um... Would it be okay if I rolled a joint? It would be very okay. - Great. - You want a scotch? I do. I'm so sorry about dessert. I fucked that up. Oh, god, stop apologizing. But that chocolate was so good! What was it? I don't know, man. - It was delicious. - Okay. - Thank you. - Sure. We'll have to do this again. Soon. My place next time! Oh, Jesus Christ! Your place. I will cook, then. Hlcook. Okay. Okay. Thanks... for before. But no problem. At all. At all. Uh, so... You get off the same time tomorrow? - Uh, yeah. Um... - Great. I'll be there. - Oh, no, you don't have to... - No, no, no, no. Are you kidding me? I can't have you walking home by yourself with that crazy running around out there. Well, okay. Thanks. - Okay. - Okay. - Okay, thanks. Bye. - Sure. Good night. Operator: This voice mailbox is full. Please try your call... Hi, there. Ready to go home? Victor: So how was work today? It was fine. Anything interesting happen? Nope. How would you feel about having some real Chinese food tonight? Uh, no. Oh, okay. I work at a Chinese restaurant. No, I know. I just thought that real... Yeah, okay. Never mind. Oh, don't forget about my party, eh? - It's on Friday night. - Okay. Wait. And I got a surprise for you. I really think you're gonna like it. Okay, great. Okay, thanks, Victor. I'll see you soon, okay? Jesus. Oh, sorry, guys. Valerie: Hello. Maybe it's because you're English and you won the referendum, you did not understand my message. I'll be clear. Keep your fucking cats away from... Gauth I e r: Hello, beautiful. It seems we may have another small problem with valérie langlois. How could anyone not love you? Spencer: Hello. Scaring birds away from her bird bath. It's fucking winter! God is scaring the birds away from her bird bath! And isn't she not supposed to block the fire escape with her garbage? I think she's losing her shit. Oh, really? You should've seen the fit she threw this morning. Her creepy little husband went away on another "business trip". Oh, I don't think he's creepy. I think he's pathetic. You don't get a serial rapist vibe off of him? No, I don't think he's that interesting. Oh! There's an article about the actual serial rapist. Ooh, national coverage. How exciting. Can I ask you something? Sure. How come you didn't tell me you knew that last victim? What was her name? - Johanne. - Yes. I don't know. I didn't know her very well. How do you even know that? - Know what? - That I knew her? One of the papers said she worked at a Chinese restaurant in ndg. Which paper? I don't know. One of the ones miss Van ilen brought over, probably. What did the article say? Just that she worked at a Chinese restaurant in ndg. It was a little thing. I was just curious why you never mentioned it. I don't know. It was referendum night. Victor was around. Hmm. Yes, Victor is always around these days, isn't he? Guess so. How are things going between you guys? What's that supposed to mean? Oh, give me a fucking break, Louise. I don't know what you're talking about. Fine. Can I have another? Only if it's a road rocket. I'm done. What the fuck? What the fuck are you doing, Victor? Oh! Uh, good morning. Uh. Madame gauthier said it was okay. Well, I just thought that it was a bit ridiculous not to have it in this day and age, regardless of whether you're living here or not. But you are living here, so it's even more ridiculous. What? Uh. It's a ramp, for wheelchairs. Hey, Spencer? I'm sorry, bud. I clearly should have asked you first. I guess I thought it might be a nice surprise. For Christmas. I shouldn't have done it. I didn't think it would piss you off. Oh, no. You didn't piss me off. No, I'm gonna make you some coffee. Hello, beautiful. At one point, enough is enough. - She's been calling every day! - Yeah. Me, too. What, guys? Are you hungry? So have you called her back? No. Not yet. I mean... Okay. I get it! I mean, I just don't really have anything to say to her. Van ilen: I left my number on the fridge. I won't be back until the 27th. Spencer: Okay, thank you. I know you don't want me to mention it, but I'd feel so much better if I knew you had people to be with on Christmas day. I know. I understand. Okay! Happy holidays, miss Van ilen. All right then, Spencer. You as well. You, young man, are a candidate for sainthood. Oh, me? Hardly, hardly. I just like to do stuff with my hands. Merry Christmas! Merry Christmas to you, too. She's so nice. I hate her. Yeah.uh”. So do you think you might come to my Christmas party? I'm not so much for parties, man. Well, this one's gonna be super chill. It's just my brother driving from Ottawa... Victor, I'm really, really not interested in going to a party. Any party. No matter how chill. Okay. I just thought you might... Now, I can imagine what you thought, but I'm gonna pass. Okay. Louise will be so disappointed. - Hi. - Here. Wow! Thank you. Come on in. Louise. That's my brother, Jonah. Jonah, this will be Louise. Hey, the famous Louise. Nice to meet you. Oops! Hey, this is Jean-Marc. - Hi. Nice meeting you. - Hi. Nice meeting you. Uh, who wants a drink? - You do? Yeah. Uh, did you want to drink this stuff? Uh, no. I'll just have a vodka. - Oh, right. A drink-drink. Right? - Sure. Yeah. All right. Done. - Is that you that just... - Louise, are you... I'm sorry. No, no, I'm sorry. Go ahead, please. No, I'm sorry. Mine was stupid. You go. Uh, I have to pee anyway, so... - So? - So what? What do you think of her? - Louise? - Yeah, of course, Louise! Oh, I haven't gotten a chance to talk to her. She's so awesome. Yes. Yeah, she seems great, man. She seems good. We're engaged. You... holy shit! Uh, congratulations! We're not telling anybody yet. Okay. She wants to wait till spring. - It's more romantic. - Yeah, yeah, sure. - Victor... - Oh, my god! - I almost completely forgot! - What? Uh, Louise? Hey, uh... I have a surprise for you. Oh... sorry. Um, no. It's okay. One more second. Okay. Victor. Trust me. Trust me. Louise, meet balthazar. He was my cat over in China, so I had to wait for him to go through all the quarantine procedures. They do all that stuff in Ottawa. It's kind of weird, eh? So my brother just brought him in. He's great, eh? He's perfect. Jonah: What are you doing? Up the fire escape to the first floor? Yeah. Yes. Jonah? Are you serious? What time? I don't know, Victor. Like 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning. Because the first floor is Spencer's apartment. Um, are you sure that's what you saw? Yeah, I'm sure. It just doesn't make any sense. Why not? Well, because Spencer's in a wheelchair. Like, were you wearing your glasses? Fuck. Yeah, I'm lying. That's why. - I didn't say that. - I'm always wearing my glasses! Give it a rest. Come on, guys, please. This kid! My god! - Jonah: Hey! - Louise: Am I too early? No, no, no. Everyone's up. Come in. Come in. Jonah: Good. Hmm. Jonah: Um, eggs are getting cold. Coming. Spencer: Hello? Hey, man, it's Victor. Yeah? Uh, merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, man. You guys have 20 seconds. Victor: So, uh, merry Christmas, or whatever. Spencer? Spencer: Yep? Have you seen my cats? Nope. No, I mean, like, today. Like, this morning. Okay, thanks. Madame gauthier? If I don't take them down now, they'll be hanging all year. I just know it. Okay. You haven't seen my cats, have you? Uh... no, not today. You guys... What happened? Don't look. Don't look. Don't look. It's okay. Spencer: Are you joking? Of course it was her. She fucking hated those cats. Well, we don't know that they were poisoned. Yes we do, Victor! They didn't have simultaneous heart attacks. Victor: Okay, well, we don't know that it was valérie! Yes, we do. Well, we have to do something. We can't just leave the cats lying in the snow, and, we just can't pick them up and drop them in the garbage! Well, obviously not, Victor. Jesus Christ. Well, what "Jesus Christ"? People do that. Louise isn't people. I know that. Louise, what would you like to do? I want to Bury them... Under valérie's window. I love you. I love you. Hi, there. - Um... I need to see him. - Yeah... There's another murder? Nathalie: Yeah, a few days ago. - You didn't read about it? - No. - Salut, Nathalie! - Hi, Victor. Ready to go? Yeah. Victor: Yeah, so, I told madame gauthier, I said, "how can we let balthazar out when we know for a fact" there's a cat killer in our building? We already lost Mozart. And we lost Tia Maria. "And that valérie woman is so insane." Boy, it's cold! Are you sure? Because, hke”. I bought lamb. I thought that was your favorite. It is. I just need to take a bath, and I'm gonna need some quiet time. Okay. Okay. Uh... I... are you sure... You don't want to just come up and see balthazar? Do you think it'd be okay if he spent the night with me? I know we haven't known each other very long. But when I met you, I... I... I felt that connection. I... I couldn't explain... Uh, so... I know we haven't known each other very long. But, like, I feel this connection to you that I can't explain. Oh, fucking... Try to explain it, asshole. I know we haven't known each other very long. Uh, but it's like... I feel this connection to you. And I can't really explain it. Uh... And, I look at you and I see that maybe you feel it, too? Okay. So here's what's on the list I'm making. Tell me if I'm forgetting something, okay? First, I need a straight razor. Second, plastic gloves. Third, well, I need something to rape her with. And then, I guess I need sperm. I'm gonna make it seem real. One second. One second. Uh... well, okay. - Louise: I'll just take care of this. - Yeah. - Okay. - Oh. I just have to go down to my place for a second. Don't look at me like that. Have you seen that? Yeah, you're right. There's a lot more detail here. Do you think he kills them while he's raping them, or after? Or before even. I don't know. I bet before. Why do you think you're so interested in all this stuff? - Why do I think? - Yeah. That's such a prick question. You'd never ask a guy that question. Oh, actually, you probably would. I don't know, Spencer. I'm a voyeur and it turns me on. I'm numb and it makes me feel alive. Who cares? "Why" is boring, and it's the wrong question. - It is? - It is. And it's beneath you. So what's the right question? What's next? Did you ever like dancing? No, but I always liked watching. Oh, oh... so then you like this? I've seen better. Not recently though, huh? Ooh! You suck. No tip unless you fill me up again. - Oh, you're really leaving? - Oh, yeah, bye. I'm gonna miss my fucking train, Louise. I have the flu, Nathalie. Hey, babe. I came home early. Louise? Victor: Louise? Take it down a notch, Vic. Hey, this is Louise. Leave a message. Hey Louise, it's me, Victor. I stopped by the restaurant, but I guess you took off early, which is smart, because it's really, really cold out there. So, uh... Okay, um... Hope you're keeping warm. Call me. Bye. Louise: Oh, Jesus! Shh. Please, no! Please, no! Jesus! Shh... shh... Oh, god, this is so disgusting! Oh, my god, I don't know how people do this. Oh! Ugh! Fuck it. - Will you help me up? - What? Give me a boost. Ah... sure! Yeah, yeah. Oh! - Give me my bag. - What? Oh, shit. Thanks. Fuck! Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck! Son of a bitch! - Hey! - Oh, hi. Uh... you good? I feel like I haven't seen you in forever. Louise: Two days. Victor: It feels like forever. Good morning! - Morning. - Morning. Quite the brouhaha down there. Yeah. What's going on, exactly? You tell me. Madame gauthier? Oh, it's terrible. It's just terrible. I've never seen anything more gruesome in my whole life, including on the TV. Uh... what happened? Valérie langlois! She was murdered. Uh, where were you last Tuesday night? I was here. All night? Oh, no, that's right! Tuesday night. It was my night-skiing night. It must have... It must have slipped my mind. Were you alone? Ah, yes, I was alone. No one came by? Nope. No, no one came by. You know, the landlady... She tells us that you're friends with the lady upstairs and the gentleman above her? - Did she? - Yeah. Uh, well, friendly, I would say. Uh, I think friends would be a bit of an exaggeration. I see. So I guess they can't verify anything you've said. No, I guess not. Was... was that the night that, that valérie died, last Tuesday? How well did you know her? Not well. Enough that you could recognize her face? I mean, enough to recognize her voice. She was very fond of screaming at her husband from the balcony. You ever been in her apartment? Ah... never, no. Know any of her friends? Sorry, fellows. I just... I don't know, I just... I don't think I'm gonna be very helpful here. My card, monsieur. Roland? It's a great name. My cellular number is on the back. There it is. Okay. Best of luck, you guys. I guess we can cross him off, huh? - We cannot. - Really? Never make assumptions. Let me see your notebook. Man, you got terrible handwriting. This is that girl's apartment. The one from the Chinese restaurant. - She's probably at work. - Right. Right. Hmm. I'm sorry. - Thank you, Mr. Spiegleman. - Sure thing. Sure thing. Okay. Uh... Where were you last Tuesday evening? Here, in my apartment. All night? Yeah. Yeah, there was a snow storm that night. No, no, no! Maybe there wasn't. It seems like it snows all the time. - Were you alone? - Yeah. No! No, no. Uh... My fiancée was here with me. Uh... Louise. Wait, is that the girl from downstairs? Yeah, yeah. Yeah, Louise. Yeah. It was part of the night. No, no. I'd say most of it, actually. And balthazar, my cat. Yeah, the three of us. Maybe, I shouldn't have said anything about the cats, but you... You probably already heard about that stuff. It's just madame gauthier loves to gossip. And, and, and valérie, and Louise, and the cats. That whole thing has been a real kind of hot topic as of late. But you probably already know about that stuff. Pretend I don't. So, Louise, right? Yeah. Louise, where were you last Tuesday night? Home. - Alone? - Yeah. - All night? - Yeah. I came home from work. I fed the cat, took a bath, went to sleep. Like most nights. Yeah. Okay. You didn't see anybody? I don't know, maybe somebody else in the building? How well did you know valérie langlois? Not well. How would you characterize your relationship with her? Vaguely. How would you characterize her relationship with your cats? I'm awfully sorry for your loss. I understand you had a very special bond with Mozart and Tia Maria. Chou: Hello? Mmm-hmm, I did. Chou: Louise, telephone. Hmm. Excuse me. Hello? Spencer: I think you should come to my place for a drink when you get home from work today. We have things to discuss. Okay, listen, mom. I am right in the middle of something with the cops right now, but that sounds fine. Spencer: Don't say anything you don't need to. Bye, mom. Sorry about that. So what were you asking me, again? Oh right, my cats. Yes, she hated them. She probably killed them. But, I mean, who cares, right? They're just cats. Bilodeau: So where to now? Back to the lab, or... No. I think we have to go back to that apartment. Something's going on with these people. Just let me feed balthazar. Shh. I told them almost everything. I was just so nervous. Louise, I couldn't stop talking. I told them about you and Valerie and the cats. - And I told them about us. - What do you mean? I told them that... Oh, shit, I should have told you, too. I'm such an idiot. What did you tell them, Victor? I told them that you and I were engaged, and that you spent the night of the murder here, with me. But that's not the worst thing. The worst thing is, I know who killed valérie, and nobody will believe me. So what did you wanna talk about, mom? So I think we have a common problem, Louise. - We have? - Yes. I know you have a problem, Spencer, but I didn't realize I did. Oh, you didn't? Ah! Was that big cop the guy who questioned you aboutjohanne? Suddenly you remember her name. And he questioned you again today, didn't he? About valérie? That's so odd that you remember Johanne. Yes, it was the same cop. Well, I think I have a solution. And here I am, still unclear on the problem. Louise. I know we haven't had a chance to chat properly since last Tuesday. But I think you're a smart person. I really do. And I like to think that you think that I'm a smart person. Now, do you wanna keep fucking around? Or do you want to hear my solution? Sure. Victor. Victor? Victor. Spencer. I saw him walking outside, that night! And I... I would have thought that my eyes were playing tricks on me, but stupid Jean-Marc kept saying he thought he saw someone crawling into Spencer's window when they were here for their Christmas visit. Okay. So you saw Spencer walking. That means he's getting better. No. No, it means so much more than that. Oh, Louise, you always want to see the best in people, don't you? I guess so. Spencer killed valérie, and that's not all. - You think... - No, I know. It makes perfect sense. He's a killer. Spencer, he's the ndg serial killer. What does Victor have to do with any of this? Nothing. That's why he's the perfect fall guy. Just moved back to town. He's lonely, he's sad. We can pin valérie's murder on him, and probably a bunch of others, too. How? By writing an effective suicide note for him. I think together, we can come up with something satisfying for both parties involved. You think you've thought this through? I've been thinking about it all daylong. Now, look, when I saw Spencer, he saw me, too, or at least I think he did. And if he's the man I'm pretty sure he is, then he's gotta be thinking only one thing, "I need to kill Victor." And we can use that to our advantage. - We can? - Yes. Yes! We can set a trap. Because I know he's just waiting for a chance, for any chance to get rid of me. So we're gonna fake his suicide? - Exactly. - How? Throw him off a bridge! Who cares? Clearly not you. Oh, that's right, that's right. We're talking about your boyfriend. - Fiancé, apparently. - Oh! Be sure to let me know where you register. So you're saying we'll let a trap play out? Yes. But a trap in which you are the bait? Exactly. What if he actually does manage to kill you, Victor? He won't. Because I'm not just me. I'm us. And we're a team. And together, we're stronger than him. Suicide note, bridge... Keep it simple, stupid, and shit gets done. Right? Right. Are you in? I'm in. They haven't told you anything? Nothing at all. That's almost irresponsible. I agree. Gauthier: Hello, beautiful. - Van ilen: Hello, dear. - Bye. - What a strange girl. - Hmm. Apparently, she and Victor gotengaged. Really? Huh. That didn't take very long. Hmm. - What's the music? - It's dvofak. It's intense. All right, gang. We're about 10 minutes away from eating lamb. Spencer has the best pots and pans. Louise, why don't you fix us some drinks? And Louise, maybe just turn the music down just a wee bit? Uh... you don't mind, do you, Spencer? Not at all. - Louise: Dinner party? - Well, whatever. The three of us have dinner together. Why? Because then we were the last people to see Victor, and we can tell the cops how sad and weird he was acting, how close to the end, in retrospect. Okay. Spencer, I feel like I haven't seen you in forever. I never got the chance to ask you, have you tried the ramp, yet? You know what? I haven't. - Really? - Really. You'll be the first call when I do, though. That's funny. What's funny, Victor? It's just that the other day I passed you in the hallway. I could have sworn I smelled the cold on you. You know how it is. In the winter time, you go outside, and the cold kind of sticks to your clothing, and hangs around you sort of like a... - Like a smell? - Like a smell. Exactly. You must have been mistaken. I must have been mistaken. I must have. Thank you, Spencer! Thank you, Victor. You're a terrific cook. Oh! We have to do this again very soon. I hope so. Good night, guys. So you tuck him in, you leave him alone in his room. But the two most important things are, you go back to your apartment and... And I leave his window open. I got it. And how will I know if you've done both those things? I'll run a bath. Okay, so then we wait for Spencer? Yeah, but here's the thing. We won't be the only ones waiting for him. Brrr. So did you say we're gonna be here, like, all night? I didn't say one way or the other. Okay. Why, is that what we're looking for? You said we were looking for a sign, so I thought... Okay. It's cold in here, eh? What, bilodeau? What do you want to do? Maybe I could go get us a couple of coffees. - Go, then! Go. - All right. Thanks! The cops? No. I think... I think that's a terrible idea, Victor. Don't call the cops. I think it's a good idea, I think. You already did, didn't you? Yes, of course I remember you, Mr. Spiegleman. We just met. Information about whom? Well, what about his condition? What do you think, guys? Time for a miraculous recovery? I already know what you think. Okay. Ah, fuck! I'm sorry about this, Spencer, I really am. Louise! Brandt: Police! You industrious little fucker! Brandt: Police. Victor: Oh, no! Leave her alone! God, you are fucking pathetic, do you know that, man? Do you know what kind of a person you're trying to save here? Huh? Do you want to know what kind of girl she really is? I know everything I need to know. I know, sweetie, I know you're hungry. Brandt: Call 911. I'm going down there. - Mr. Spiegleman? - Yeah? - Call 911. - Okay. You did the right thing, Mr. Spiegleman, every step of the way. Okay. Okay. You can stop now. Oh, silly me. I thought you were hungry.
