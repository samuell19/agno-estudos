He's the mole. Stop right there! Stop him! Go! My leg is broken. Do it yourself. Stay right there. Hey. Padjad. Tu, what's the matter? We're exposed. - And the hostage? - Safe for the moment. We're heading to your location. Keep the hostage safe at all costs. Noted. The police have recently busted a criminal organization and have successfully rescued the victims held in captivity. Many have been arrested. According to the statement from Officer Padjad, this case was solved under the leadership of a third-generation Chinese officer in the city. The eight months long espionage operation finally paid off and the shocking kidnapping case of a Chinese businessman came to an end. (Border Town, Country M, Southeast Asia) - Hi, Officer Zhang. - Hi, Officer Zhang. Hi, Officer Zhang. Hi. - Hi, Officer Zhang. - Hi, Officer Zhang. - Hi, Officer Zhang. - Hello. - Hi, Officer Zhang. - Hello, everyone. Officer Zhang here rescued the hostage. That's why all of you are rewarded with some top-quality tea leaves. A round of applause, please. - Bravo! - Nice one, Officer Zhang. Let's talk. Back to your work. You solved a big case. You should be happy. Why are you sulking? So? That Mr. Zheng from Yunnan regards you as his savior now. Lao Ban Zhang Pu'er Tea from Mount Sanduo. One stack is worth more than ten thousand yuan. Come. Have a taste. Don't be so tense. So what? Enjoy the fruit of your hard work. I don't want this. Where is the letter about my promotion? It hasn't been approved yet. You said I would get a promotion once I'm done with the mission. That's why I went to that god-forsaken place for eight months! The higher-up does not like your approach. You should have waited for us before acting. If I did that, they would have killed the hostage. Did they now? No. Because I did the right thing. No, you were lucky. You're lucky because thanks to me, you get to sip on expensive tea here. I don't care. Reapply for my promotion. Hey. Are you telling me what to do? Are you telling your boss what to do? You're telling me what to do? Jie was an obedient kid. But after you enrolled him in this boarding school, he turned quiet. And he disrespects the teachers. This is his essay. Have a look. Thank you. Jie. What is this? Apologize to your teacher now. Apologize. It's okay. Don't force him. Jie. As long as you recognize your mistake... Don't touch my face. You're not my mom. Jie. How can you do this? Sorry, miss. It's my fault. The school cannot replace the role of a family. Especially for kids raised by a single parent. I know you're busy but please spare some time for your kid. Jie. I'll be here these few days. I can keep you company. You're busy. You always leave whenever you want. But you want to see me catch the bad guys, don't you? I caught many bad guys this time. It is a big achievement. But I don't want to be abandoned. I am not abandoning you. You're lying. You said that last time too. Come, Jie. Don't be mad. Do you know? Miss Yibet called me today and said you're talented in maths. And I said, didn't Jie get 40 something in his exam? Why do you mean he's talented in maths? Miss Yibet then said, it's because Jie always thinks the biggest number is the correct answer. All right. If you still do this badly in the math exam, I'll spank you. What's the matter? You're hurt? Jie. Where are you going? Stay. Show me. Why are you this badly hurt? Why aren't you running? Let go of me. Let go of me. Daddy. I'm scared. Don't be. I'll be here. Will you abandon me again? I won't. I'll always be by your side. Can you arrest those bullies? (Message: I found those guys who bullied your son.) - You're here, Tu. - Did you find them? Yes. These three are the delinquents who bullied your son. They always come to this nightclub. The owner of this bar is their boss. His name is Dala. Dala. Let me pour you a glass. You want to pour me a glass? Really? Chug it. 10,000 yuan. 10,000 yuan. 10,000 yuan? 10,000 yuan. 20,000 yuan. 30,000 yuan. It's yours. Chug it now. Thanks, Dala. This place is no fun. Let's go somewhere more comfortable. Let me get my bag. Where is your bag? Dala. What are you doing? You think I'm that gullible? Dala. Just you wait! Put your hands up in the air! Move aside. Kill him! Come at me. Hello. There is a brawl in the bar street. There are drugs too. Bring more people with you. Something's fishy with this place. Bring everyone back to the police station. - Hurry. - I know nothing, Mr. Officer. What is wrong with you? I told you I would register the case. Do I say you're completing a mission now or do I say you were in that brawl too? I toiled my arse off to get you a promotion and you had to hand me this mess. How am I supposed to write the report now? I don't want my promotion anymore. What? I don't want my promotion anymore. Let me be a police officer again. Once it's done, I won't go on any mission. Dude. You asked me to get a promotion for you. Now, you don't want to get promoted anymore. What do you want? Why did I work so hard back then to get a promotion? Because after Jie's mother passed away, I wanted to be a good role model for Jie. I wanted to be a good father. That's why I put my neck on the line. But then I realized that is not what Jie needs. He needs my company, that's all. I can't leave Jie again. Understood. Okay. I'll find a way to reinstate you. Dala is backed by someone. His father is a human trafficker. He's been on our wanted list for many years and I just found 20kg of drugs in his car. If we retrace it, those human traffickers will be ours sooner or later. Release me. Mr. Officer. I regret my mistake now. Give me another chance. Don't waste my time. What is your name? I don't know them. I was just there to drink. Hey! I want to make a call. Where precisely do you come from? If you won't cooperate, I will detain you too. Let me do it. Have some water. What is your name? Your name. Su Qinmao. You're Chinese, aren't you? Yes. The Chinese don't usually go there. My family is mire in debt. I can't earn money if I'm deported. You smuggled in here. Of course, you'll be deported. I can't let that happen. Please. Just help me this once. People in your line of work should have seen this coming. And I already helped you in the club. Hey! What are you doing? What are you doing? So arresting them was the right thing. But what did I do wrong? Do you think you helped me there? You're ruining my life. We're even then. I'm warning you. If you do this again, we'll say you work with Dala to sell drugs. You'll be imprisoned for like a decade and you will not be able to earn any money. If you don't want it, cooperate with us. Thank you. It's serious this time. The cop who arrested Dala has been watching us for many years and he wants to dismantle our human trafficking business. Dala was arrested this time. With drugs too. He'll get a heavy sentence. The police have established a task force to track us. If Dala confesses, they can locate us very soon. We're at our wit's end now. Find me another lawyer. I want my son to be released without charge. We have done a background check on the cop. This is everything about him. Get to work now. I have arrested all those bullies. No one will bully you again. I won't go somewhere far away to work anymore. I'll keep you company every day. For real? Daddy, you're amazing. Of course, I am. I raised you alone. If only mommy was here. Look. The song in this music box is daddy's and mommy's favorite. Whenever we listen to this song, it's as if the three of us are still there. All right? All right! You fell? Jie? Jie? Jie? Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! Daddy! - Hello? - Padjad, Jie was taken away. Three people. In a silver van. Car plate number HDC2596. It just left the Central Highway. Help me track it. Noted. Give me all the security footage on the Central highway. Car plate number HDC2596. Someone just kidnapped a child. Get this car for me. Yes, sir. Where is your dad? God knows where he's been hiding for more than a decade. There's no way you don't know your father funded your club. We hardly talk. Every six months, he'll send someone to give me money. I don't know where he is now. He's a cautious person. He'll find someone else to do his bidding every once in a while. I have never met them. What I know is that they travel by land. But I don't know which route they take. Don't lie to me. If you deceive me, you'll have one more crime on you. Human trafficking. I know nothing. Whoever crosses him, he'll kill the person. I'm afraid of him too. Contact the municipal council. Request clearance to obtain all security footage on every highway. - Did you find it? - Not yet. Found it. - Where? - Here, HDC2596. They switched the vehicle and the route too. Hurry. Hello? Did you find them? They switched to another vehicle. Car plate number ZKB8764. They are on G32 Highway now. They might cross the border with Jie. I'll meet you at the border. Okay. (National Border) Follow me. As usual, we intercepted these bargirls in their deportation. Take them away via the backdoor. Once you cross the border, they are none of our business. As for your special goods, I'll make an exception this time. You can cross the border with it. We will not take the risk again regardless of how much you pay us. - Where is Padjad? - He's still talking to them. We can always get the approval the day we apply for it. Why aren't we allowed to cross the border for our investigation this time? The rule just changed. Go back and get the approval from my superior. - What's the matter? - They won't approve it out of a sudden. Cross the border as a tourist. I'll go back and talk to their superior. Okay. What took you so long to pick the phone up? Little kid. Don't run. If they catch you, they'll beat you to death. Do what? I don't have the time. Be a good girl. I'll keep you company at night. Behave now. I'll hang up. - Hey! - Run! What's wrong? Feng. I have a situation here. A woman took that kid and escaped. - Look for her. - All right. Turn back. - Run. - Don't you run. Was there a kid here? Su took a kid and ran into the woods. Stay right there. - You dare to run? - Let go of me. - You dare to run? - Let go! Let go of me. Let me go! - Run! - Daddy! Daddy! - Daddy! - Jie. - Let go of me. - Release him. Let go of me. Let him go. Release me! Let go of me. Let him go! Jie. Daddy. Daddy! Let go of me! Let go of me. - Jie. - Let me go. Daddy! Daddy! Daddy. Daddy. Let me go. Let me go. Let me go. That hurts. It's time to reapply your medication. Do it yourself. How long was I out? One day. Tu, are you okay? Did you find Jie? Hear me out. We can confirm now that Dala's father kidnapped Jie. This Khamtai Chantap has been hiding for many years but we can never find his hideout. Find it then! Where is he now? You think you're the only one worrying? Everyone worries about Jie. We have exhausted all alternatives but we can't get news of Jie. Worrying serves nothing. Bring someone in here. The border force officer right there violated the customs law of both countries. He was suspended. Our chief is now applying for a cross-border joint investigation team. You can't do anything there. Just come... Why did you save me? Why didn't you give chase to them? You're crazy. You know where they are. Bring me to them. Bring me to my son. Show me. I'm talking to you. Answer me. How could I give chase to them? I was also half-dead. I walked more than ten kilometers with you on my back and I didn't even get a thank you. And you started barking like a rabid dog. I'm not your subordinate. Without this clue, I might never find my son again. What do these markings mean? It means my son might be kept there? Keep the money. If you can help me find my son, I'll give you another 100,000 yuan. I know men like you look down on women like me. I need money but that doesn't mean I'll do anything for it. Bill, please, mister. I didn't mean to insult you. Only you can help me find my son now. Please help me. I have been following them all these years. Before I was brought somewhere else for the business, I would be sent to a transfer center first. I once saw they keep kids there. But I was sent there in a truck. I didn't know where it was. But I know there is a temple. Have you seen this boy? He's my son. He's around this tall and he's wearing a red shirt. Have you seen this boy? Have you seen this boy? Around this height. It's a boy. Excuse me, have you seen this kid? Tu. You can visit seven to eight temples at most per day. There are over 70,000 temples there. Even if we mobilize every police, it'll take several years to visit all the temples. You're looking for a needle in a haystack. Even if it's impossible, I won't give up. Not at all. Why are you helping me? What I did on the truck was a spur-of-the-moment decision. I don't know why I suddenly had the courage. Perhaps if I hesitated for another minute, I would be too scared to act. How long have you worked for them? Six years. For another two years, I could settle all my family's debt. Don't you hate them? They are my adopted parents. Without them, I would have been dead. I grew up somewhere poor. Every household there has to borrow money to live. Therefore, many people will leave that place. They work to repay the debt. There are so many people like me. What about your biological parents? I can't even recall what they look like nor where I lived. I just remember when I was very small, I was playing outside. Then suddenly, a pair of hands clamped around my mouth. And I lost consciousness. When I woke up, I saw light coming through a slit. I was put in a suitcase and sold. I don't know how many times I was sold until I found my current adopted parents. If I'm not mistaken, I should be 26 years old now. Every child has the right to lead a proper life. If someone opened the suitcase that kept me, maybe my story would have been different. We have to find Jie. Sir. The lawyer we just found called and said Dala would still get 30 years of jail time. I'll avenge you before rescuing you. You just want to avenge yourself. Growing up, you never stop making me into another you. You're my son. I gave you the best of everything. Whoever harms you will die. I didn't do anything wrong. If you didn't do anything wrong, why did I become the way I am today? Feng. This is everything about the kid. Bring him out. Come. Come. Come. Let go of me. Put me down. - Come. - Let go of me. - Try me. Move again. - Stand still. Stop the car. Is it this temple? It should be. Let's have a look. Okay. This is the place. Here. This is the warehouse where I stayed The transfer center should be inside. Call the police now. Wait for me here. Hi, I would like to report something. (Message: Client matching.) Bring him away. Let go of me. Stop thrashing about. Come. Sit tight. Don't move. Let go of me. Have you seen this boy? Daddy. So annoying. Stop crying. I'll sell whoever cries. Stop crying. Help! - Get your thing. - Get your thing. Take him down. Where is my son? Where is my son? Tell me now. Let's go. The police are here. Let them deal with this. You're not a police officer here. If you're caught, you'll be deported. You won't be able to find your son. Go now. Come. Stop it. Let go of me. Tu! Let go of me. How are you supposed to rescue your son like this? Whenever I packed my luggage before I went on a mission, some of my clothes would go missing. I thought I lost them by accident but then I found out that Jie hid them. I confronted him and he said whenever I wasn't home, hugging my clothes to sleep would make him feel like I was still there. He wouldn't then be afraid. All my life, I told myself to be a kind person. But why do tragedies fall onto me one after another? Good things will come to good people. Eat now. You can only blame your father. Find the cop. Then kill him. Feng. Leave it to me. Sir. Two stir-fried noodles, please. Okay. This one and this one. Two portions, please. And two drinks. Okay. Hey, Padjad. Anything new? The police over there got something from the arrested human traffickers. They confirmed that Khamtai is in the same province as you now. But they don't know his precise location. Also, I got the approval. I can come whenever. - Thanks. - Come again. My daughter. Don't harm my parents. Just come to me instead. Okay. If you do care about your parents, when you go back, make the cop drink this. I'm talking to you. Answer me. How could I give chase to them? How? Stop it. Let go of me. How are you supposed to rescue your son like this? All my life, I told myself to be a kind person. But why do tragedies fall onto me one after another? Good things will come to good people. You have the kindest soul I've ever seen. (Heart: Healthy, ready for heart transplant, Blood Type AB) Hello? I have read your message. It's the right blood type. It matches with my grandson's. To get him a healthy heart, I'm ready to pay anything. I just want to seal the deal now. The buyer is here. It's a healthy heart compatible with your grandson. My grandson will be safe. Three million U.S. dollars. Okay. Hello? Sir, you might need to hurry up. My friend got in. Did you manage to track him? We just got it. Khamtai is here. Your friend is closer to him than we are. It'll take three hours for us to reach there. - Hello? - Have you located him? Yes. We're coming over now. - Wait until we're there. - I can't. They want to operate on my son. Send the location to me. His heart is compatible with your grandson. - Begin now. - Okay. Jie. Jie! Hey! Stop right there. Jie. Jie. Jie. Daddy. Being a father is not easy. Leave with him. I admire you but I won't go easy on you. Stay right there! - Run! - You can't run away. Get up. Put him in cuffs. Come. Come. Jie. Su. Where is Jie? Child trafficking is a serious crime that the police force vows to eliminate. In a joint operation earlier, the police successfully dismantled a cross-border human trafficking network. All members of the network have been arrested, including the fugitive gang members as well as its leader, Khamtai Chantap. However, the kidnapped victim, Zhang Xiaojie, is still missing. Sorry. Have you seen this kid? He's my son. He went missing three years ago. He should be this tall now. I have some photos of him here. If you see him, can you give me a call? Okay. Tu, the police chief from the other side will visit us next week to thank you in person. I'm around 4,000 kilometers away from you. You know, the criminal who kidnapped Jie has been arrested, but he sold Jie a few days before his arrest. When the buyers knew they had the child of a cop, they quickly sold him too. God knows where he is now. We can hardly trace him. I know it might be hard to swallow this pill. But do prepare for the worst outcome. These few years, you look after your parents while you help me find Jie. Thank you. I quite like my current life now. Do you know when you will stop searching? I don't. I used to hate my parents. I hated them for not looking for me. But you made me realize that maybe they have never given up. No, I didn't. It's you. Good things will come to good people.
