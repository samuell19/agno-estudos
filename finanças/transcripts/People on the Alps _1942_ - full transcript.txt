PEOPLE ON THE ALPS Based on the short stories of Jozsef Nyiro Screenplay by Music by Cinematography by Directed by Starring Somewhere in Csik or Haromszek Produced by the Hunnia Film Works Many folks live on the Alps. Herders and other poor people. They cut trees and tend to other people's cattles. Men of the forest are strong and resilient, unafraid of blood and death. They only have looming notions about God, and they regard life like wolfs do: gloomy, superstitious tales, nameless secrets hold a grasp on their brains, they murmur strange songs, and some of them are able to talk to animals. Within their gaze the depth of the mountains and the scared fear of hell are reflected. They seldom descend to the church, and on sermons they listen with a dazzled stare. However, God knows and loves them. Lord, keep harm away from us! - Is he alive? - I think he fell asleep. His soul is ailing; even fever has struck him. I was so frightened that you may be late; I even lit a candle for him. What's up with the baptism? The reverend wasn't at home. What are we to do then? Miho, the vestryman, gave me this book: we can baptise on our own. It is written thus; he made a dent here where needed. I gave him two wagons of wood in exchange. He even gave me holy salt, where did I put it? I've lost it... A good thing that I brought holy water. That's the main thing. Oh, Pontius... it froze, broke the jar apart. Take care, it's also hallowed! It's written here what are we supposed to do. Are you still able to read? If I haven't forgotten it, I am. Take a look then, what do you see? If only I knew if this is the letter big T or big F... Leave it... If you cannot, well, you cannot. I have journeyed for so long in vain. We need to do something. The wolf declares death for the third time.... And if he dies unchristened, he won't be accepted neither by Heaven or Earth, and his soul shall wander crying on the Alps until the world's end. I now know how to baptize. I read it from the book. Then go ahead. My little Gergo. I hereby baptise you. - It's alright, Anna. - It is your turn now. Give the sign of the cross to validate it, since you're not able to read. Gergo shall be your name. - Come with me. - What do you want with him? I signed for him a tree of life. He needs to touch it so that the tree will recognise my son. From this moment on, the fates of the tree and child will be one. I will introduce you to the Alps, little Gergo. I'll introduce you. Look down upon us and listen to me, you living tree. Here I introduce to you your sibling, little Gergo. From today, your life is his, and his life is yours. From this day on, no one should try to harm either of you; your days should not cease before the length that fate measured for you; Amen! Don't be afraid, little Gergo. The forest loves you already. Look, little Gergo: the birds are nesting here, this is their world. See how beautiful they are? Pet them! Never hurt them. This is our church. We're not allowed to talk here. Look, look! This is my son, little Gergo. Have a good look at him. Wake up, Reverend! The day has broken for a while! The fish live here! Look at that! Is that your son Gergo? Yes, he is. A real bull calf he is! - Well met! - Well met! Do you like sheep, big fellow? He does, but her mother ate it before him. I didn't milk them to have more milk, but I won't let you go with an empty hand! Take this, the child needs a playing companion. There. God bless you all! Come, take this lone calf so that I won't see it again! You suckle her, I'm too old for this! We couldn't accept such a big gift anyway, uncle Marci. That's not why we came. If Lorinc could give you sheep, then his godfather can give you a calf too! An entire calf? Little Gergo! Don't venture too far in! People on the Alps! Everyone come to meet Gergo Csutak! This part of the pine-grove is forbidden territory. You shouldn't let even game step into it! - Don't you have water? - We'll reach a brook soon, sir. Is the water cold, damsel? Try it and you'll see. I'll see if you share it with me. You're too old for this talk. He's a big oaf of a man, that is for sure! Will you embrace me now? Let the Szentgyorgy executioner embrace you! Reverend, don't start with this damsel, his husband is a wild man! He's a worthy little fellow, what will he grow up to be? He'll study to be a bishop. A beautiful lady like you can afford to do that. A beautiful woman like you is able to do plenty of things! He sold the entire land to the factory. But don't you worry! We have isolated a part for the cattle. But what will happen to these men? It is their own business! Whose hut is that? Mine. Who permitted you to build it here? A permission? That is no habit here. The forest is everyone's own. The forest isn't everyone's own, but the property of the Arbor Logging Corporation. The factory's own? Here in the lower ends? The factory's, if that's how you'd like to put it. I didn't know that. How long have you been living here? Five years. Who did you pay rent to in all these years? Rent? Are you jesting, sir? I didn't come here to jest, but to ask you if you are willing to pay a reasonable sum, say, 150 pengos as a rent in the shortest time possible? Me? 150 pengos after my own cottage? It isn't your cottage: everything here down to the last blade of grass is a property of Arbor Logging Corporation. - Will you pay up or not? - Are you out of your mind? I will never! Not a denier! If you keep on talking back, I'll have this hut demolished! You'll have a hard time doing it until we're here! Gergo! Gergo, what is this? People, you've all heard what I said: this territory belongs to the factory; we'll commence logging soon. No one is allowed to live here anymore. Don't throw your weight around! We wouldn't stick here anyway! Because wherever you appear, even the Lord himself leaves! And we will join Him! You two wait! Would you like to make plenty of money? Well now, everyone would like to do that. I have just the need for such a decent fellow who knows his way around all corners of the Alps and knows how to cut trees. And I'm sure we'd find some work for you too, in the canteen or the office; if you're lively enough, you can make up to 200 pengos. - 200 pengos? - I'm not sure, I'm scared. Well, can I give you an advance? Yes or no? If you're smart, you won't miss the chance: the golden hen will give you eggs whenever you like! Don't look at the others, think of yourself! Do you want your son to remain an outlaw for all his life? My son... Little Gergo... I will accept the job, sir. Make sure you move down today. I'll send up a wagon for your things. The entire supply will miss the train if you don't hasten it! Do it already! Forward! Leave the beasts! Haul off the logs! Gergely! Yes, Istvan? You will travel with the new men to Kutpatak, we have no time to waste, it'll take half a day for you to get there. Am I not even allowed a free Sunday? You'll get double wage for Sunday. Off you go. Send her over to my flat with a litre of wine. You should watch out for her husband. I've sent him over to the edge of the Alps with the workers. Here it is, my love. I lack the time even to count it, I have to leave. Why do you have to? Can't we even spend the Sunday together? Stop that, it's worth it! I was promised a double wage. Listen, Mihaly Balint's house is up for sale. Mihaly Balint's house? I've already arranged it with Mihaly: he says he won't mind if we pay the money for two years. This is incredible, you're so smart, my sweet. Anna! Anna! Hurry up to the Reverend. Stop this immediately, Reverend! I have a faithful husband! A faithful husband? But where is he? Let's hurry up, men. A storm is looming. Help, people! There's a fire! Gergo, Gergo! Hey Gergo, stop it! Your hut was burned to the ground! There was a fire! My son? My wife? She was who set it on fire to get rid of the supervisor. The supervisor? He needed a woman and he assaulted her during the night. He lusted for her for long, that's why he added you to the factory; I heard that Marci Udo found them among the rifts, he was the one who housed them. You're going there in vain, Gergo, you won't get the supervisor. He also disappeared that night! If I were you, I'd rather search for my wife! - Where does it hurt? - It doesn't hurt anywhere. Try to get up. I can't! Never have I seen such a thing. There's not a scratch on her. Still, she seems to be ailing. But she's fit as a fiddle. This damned weather goes on for three days. So much snow falls that it will last until springtime. I will bring in the doctor from Szentmarton after all. I lack the money, so I'll sell the cow. - Wait with that. - I waited all winter long. I cannot wait until my wife dries her way to death. The doctor won't help her at this time. Then what should I do? Let me tell you something. Wait for the Somlyo Feast, Maria may still be able to help. Maria... I'm telling you, Anna, I'm sure that Maria can cure you. Such a sick person was brought to her, his life hung on a thread. She shouldn't overexert in my case, all I'd need is a crumb of her holy Grace. These herbs were given to me by uncle Marci. They'll make you so strong that you can walk to Somlyo on your own feet. Yes, but we can't approach Maria with empty hands. - We should bring some present. - I was thinking about that. I'll wreathe a silken whip for Little Jesus. He's a male child, it should make him happy. Silken whip? His mother should cherish that we make his boy glad! But what should we bring for Maria? For Maria... I'll carve his little son Jesus from wood. Little son... His mouth, like two red apples. Two eyes, two black pearls. His arms are white as foam. I'll carve a nice Jesus, and we can leave for the feast. - I am done. What about you? - Anna, is that you? It is nice. He looks so much like Jesus. Nice, nice. But there's a little problem. I've carved every detail on it; now I don't know where to put his heart. His heart? If I put it inside him, people will not see it. And if I put it outside, his heart can be harmed. What do you think about this? Every heart is inside. Mine and yours too. Yes, yes. But God's heart cannot be set like sinning mortals's. And people couldn't see it. The important thing isn't whether it's inside or outside... The heart is the important thing. We should only mind that it will be Jesus indeed; Jesus... His holy name be blessed. I will put it outside still. The whole world will see it then. Are you all right, Anna, my soul? Can you take it? God is helping me. Let us rest a bit. Anna, my love, my love! Little Jesus, ask your dear mother to help us! Surely you don't want your little brother to become an orphan. There is no problem at all. Let's hurry. Holy Virgin Mary, do not leave your ill servant. Oh, you gate to the Heavens, curer of ill folk, wonderful star in the dawn... Jesus, the shepherd of our pilgrimage... Have mercy on us. Jesus, the shepherd of our pilgrimage... Have mercy on us. Have mercy on us. Honored Virgin Mary... Holy Mother of God... Holy Virgin of virgins... Mother of Christ... Mother of Divine Grace... Purest Mother... Flawless Virgin Mother... Eternal Mother... Virgin Flower... Endearing Mother... This is all we could bring, because we are very poor. You were poor as well. You must love shepherds, as they were the first ones to worship your Son, even before the kings. So have mercy on us. Why are you sad, love? Say it, my sweet: Merry Virgin Mary... Merry Virgin Mary... - Work a wonder... - Work a wonder... - Cure my mother... - Cure my mother... Look down upon us, my Maria. No child can be reared without a mother. We need to return home now before night falls on the Alps. But I hope you won't forget about us, curer of ill folk. Come with me, good folks, this woman needs a doctor. A doctor? What about Maria and her wonders? You are to hope for wonders only where human science is helpless. Take a deep breath... Again. Lean forward. I have to tell you that this is a very serious case. The patient needs to be trans- ported to Kolozsvar to meet a specialist; you'll bring a letter from me to the famed professor who has access to all the appliances. He's the only one who can help. Otherwise I won't take respon- sibility for your wife's life. My heart... Don't be afraid, my love. The professor will be here soon. They say there's no one more profi- cient than him in entire Kolozsvar. Listen, man: I don't house sick people for just 2 pengos. If you don't add 1 more by next morning, I'll throw you out. If you wish to yammer, pay for it. - Good day. - Good God bless you. - Where do you hail from? - From Rakos. How come you ended up bringing such a gravely ill women on an extended journey like that? Our Somlyo friends proposed it, telling us that it's no one else but the Professor who can cure her. Not even I can by now. You're not? We set all our hopes in you, Professor. I am indeed sorry, my friend, but I have to tell you the truth: your wife only has hours left. Agony will commence soon. Should we carry her into a hospital? It's too late and redundant. She wouldn't be admitted. Perhaps they'll operate on her! Listen to me, I'll give her a final injection. May God pay you back. She will come back now. Say farewell. Anna, my love. Anna, my love! Can you hear me? - I will die, Gergely! - It's horrible for us all. What is your final wish, Anna? Gergely, I want you to bury me at home on the Alps. Soon now, little Gergely. Our Father, God. Who are in Heaven. Hallowed be your name. Your Kingdom come. Your will be done. As... - How is she doing? - She's asleep. - Don't you need anything? - No. - I'll switch on the light. - Don't you! The doctor gave her a sleeping medicine, forbidding me to disturb her. - Is she asleep? - Asleep. Then she'll get better. She will... I'm leaving to the apothecary. No one should enter until I came back. What sort of pagan man are you? What if she'll need anything? The Professor's wishes. He'll return in the morning to wake her up. Well, what is wrong, son? She's dead. Be consoled by that she's better off this way. Do you require something? I forgot to ask you how much do I owe you? A visit, an injection... Five pengos. Here you are. What are you going to do now? I'll carry her home. Seek out one of the undertaking offices, they will arrange everything. Goodbye now. - Funeral. - Sort of. I'd like to know what it costs to transport the dead. - Where to? - Szekelyland, to Rakos. A permit, a transport... 500 pengos in total! We will arrange it for 400 pengos. Yes, sir. 500 pengos... I don't have that kind of money. 20 plus 10 is 30... plus 10... is 40. This is 50. Not enough. I cannot take you home, my dear Anna. 20 plus 10 is 30... Even if I must kill a man, I will take you home, Anna! Twelve o'clock... I'd make it to the 2 o'clock one. 20 plus 10 is 30... 30. The ticket for the two of us would cost that much. Two tickets to Rakos. Anna my dear, I've got the tickets! - Good day. - Good day. Looking at it is in vain. The gaslight is shot. Is that right? Alright, my dear. Try it, perhaps you can sleep. Do you have a headache? Don't worry, we'll be home by the morning. We've suffered much; we had three kinds of louses. They commanded us to line up into two rows, and between the rows they poured down some sort of old musty maize flour for the hungry ones to lick it up. Then typhus struck us all: men fell to the ground like flies in the autumn; the soldiers dug a big lime pit, and rolled in the corpses with a spade to curb the spread of the sickness. What's wrong with the lady? The poor soul is deadly sick. I wish we were at home already. Doesn't the train shake too much? Keep it up, my love! We should light a candle to her. She wished to rest at home in our cemetary. Cemetary, cemetary. They're all alike. I'm a poor man, I couldn't afford the transport. And I have a five year-old little son too. There's no way for him not to see her mother one last time. Tickets, please. Thank you. Thank you. Ticket please. For me and my wife. She's sleeping. Rakos is up next. Good God may bless you all. We made it home, Anna, my love. Wake up, my son, your mother came home. Jesus and Mary. - Leaving already? - I am. You are right. God judges by your hand, Gergo. Don't leave little Gergo wandering about. Don't worry about him. - God bless you. - May He guide you well. Pal Kuvasz, Mate Haragos, Izsak Goldberger. Your Royal Honour, in the Haragos versus Goldberger case the parties do not attend the session. I'm cancelling the sitting in that case. I shall set as a new date 28 September. With this, today's session is over. Greetings to the gentlemen, wait for a minute! What do you want to do here? We intend to talk to the head of the bar, not the feet. Well, what do you want, what do you wish, folks? Nothing more than us being the witnesses of Gergo Csutak. And we're waiting for the trial to be started. - What trial? - Gergo Csutak's. Was there such a trial appointed for today? The said case was discussed yesterday by the council. - Yesterday? - Yesterday. That's not true, it was appointed for Thursday. Today's not Thursday but Friday. You are correct. Men, we miscalculated the date. Woe is me, it's quite a problem. If you allow me to ask, what happened to poor Gergo? Look at the verdict, notary. Gergely Csutak was found guilty by the Royal Jury in the crime of voluntary homicide, and comdemned to 10 years in prison. - That's impossible! - Poor Gergo is done with. Isn't there a way to remedy this decision? We'll prove his innocence. We'll testify on it if need be! The prosecution was justified when the accused made a full confession, so there's nothing to do here. But it's the proprietor who's the guilty party, sir! He was the one who caused his wife's death! He was the one who ruined all of us too! Gergely was simply out for justice. - The factory is guilty! - It ruined our lives! It is so simple, sir! Gergo is right! The law is clear on this. The law doesn't know what we know. The law lacks a mind and a heart when it strikes down on innocents! But the law cannot be hurt. This case is done with. You may leave. - I'd have a request, honorable judge. - What is it? Isn't it possible? If it's at all possible, I'd like to take over Gergely's penalty, sir. - You? - I'm an old man already. I wouldn't have to raise an orphan, the earth would only get lighter if I was the one to rot in prison. - Then condemn us as well! - This ain't justice, sir! We were the ones who condemned the factory to death, not Gergo! Any of us would have set it on fire! - We're here as well! - Listen, people! You know what? Divide Gergo's penalty amongst us all. We will all sit our part. That way the goat feeds well and the cabbage stays intact! Did I have a good idea there? You are decent men, friends, but the law's standing is clear! There's no other solution here. Resign to that and go home quietly. If you ignore his father, at least help out this poor, innocent child, sir. She has no father, no mother, the poor child has no one. According to law, the child will be entrusted to the care of the respective town. Please, notary, arrange the necessary paperwork today. And you should take care of the child in the meantime. Uncle Marci, uncle Marci... I've had enough... take the lead. - What's there? - What do you see? Somebody was treading this place. Must have been gendarmes. They're chasing after Gergo. - Well, God bless you all. - God bless you. What's your message for Christmas? Should the priest wait up with the sermon? He shouldn't wait for us. Now that the Holy Reverend has forgotten us up here on the Alps, we're not in a rush to follow him. You're right, at least we'll have a good night's sleep! I'll have a good rest. Our fate is fit for dogs, that's for sure! Last year they broke a path into the huge snow with a bull. Poor bull almost gave out his heart, and still they couldn't make it to the village. Snowdrop! Where's the good word? The shiny church, incense, the entire village, gospels. There's no way we can celebrate. These pagan Alps should better sink into the ground. You are right, but we won't have a Christmas. - We could still do it. - What? The midnight mass. - Without a priest? - We don't need a priest. Without a church? We have the stable as a church. We'll construct a manger in there, and we'll act out the birth of Jesus just the way it is written. How would you act out the child? Miho had a child born: we could put him in the manger, then we drive a few sheep and oxen there, light it all up, then we could sing and pray there. Something like that. I'm no child to play there. I won't move a finger for the holy Reverend. At least if we had a deck of cards... Come on, people, we've been sitting around long enough. At least we'll have a good night's sleep. I sure will. Stop! Stop! The lords must be hunting. Who's that? Is that you, Feri? Good God! This is Gergo, the murderer. Douse the light! Shut the door. Hide me somewhere, they are coming. Who are coming? The gendarmes. They shot me at the foot of the mountain. - They shot you? - Yes. - Did they hit you? - Yes. Where? Under my shoulder. That's why you're soaked with blood. Yes. That's quite a problem, the investigators will be here soon. The snow is falling, they must still be looking. No problem then. Wear a warmer dress. I'm not cold. Would you eat something? I'm not hungry. I'd rather have some water. I'm sure no one will come here now, not even the devil would find his way in here. What do you think: will you survive or die trying? I'm finished. - It was an ugly shot. - Ugly. I honestly don't understand your conduct, Gergo. Why the hell didn't you stay put in the nice warm prison where you had all the comforts? Why did you need to escape into trouble and misery? For the child... It's been half a year since I haven't received any news of him. And Holy Christmas is also here. I feel the need to create a small Christmas tree and manger for him, little Jesus... and to sing together with him. He'd also need small stockings, small boots for winter, warm dress and coat... Because there's no one out here who could take care of him. So that is why... That's why. You did a good thing that you've escaped, Gergely. In the morning I'll go in and take your son out. He is called Little Gergo, isn't he? Yes. After that, what must occur shall occur. Let's go to sleep for a while. Time has passed, time to rest. - Hey, Adam, can you hear it? - What's got into you? Why aren't you sleeping? I need to go! Where the hell would you go at this time of the night? To the afterlife. My wound has started to fester again. We should've bandaged it. No one was the wiser. It was useless to have myself shot; I still can't see my child. I am truly saddened at this. If at least for half a day you could delay your dying, while I make my way to the village. I do need 3 hours there and 3 hours back in this weather. Don't torment yourself over it, it's too late anyway. I will still try it! Stop there! Let me tell you, you were good to me, feeding me, hiding me from the gendarmes... It goes without saying. But you know that a reward of 1000 pengos hangs on my head. That's quite sum! You can have that 1000 pengos, Adam. Hey, who do you take me for? Don't talk back. Notify the notary, he'll pay you. In the Bethlehem night, the shepherds guard a cattle... In the field of the night... Gergo, little Gergo, my son... Look here, what neat little boots... Gergo... Don't be afraid, you won't catch cold in the winter. Wait, I'll call in your mother too. Anna, Anna, you! Csutak Gergo is dead! Wake up, Gergo, look around! There's the Kupas Peak, Mount Suva, Killer Hillside. The blue mountains are the Carpathians. Over them the big world awaits. Aren't you sorry to leave it? Think about it, Gergo, life is wonderful; Sun is good, brook water is sweet. Will you leave your home? Well, if you will, then God be with you, Gergo. You are right, because from these mountains, valleys, from this big wide world you didn't even own the bit where your tear has fallen. But we cannot let you go on your big journey alone. Am I right, brother? I'll rest this axe next to you. Don't underestimate it, for it's a good tool, and who knows what forests await you in the afterlife? I just came to announce that the murdering Gergo who escaped from prison was caught by me in the night in a wounded state, and now I'd like to have the 1000 pengos reward. You should be ashamed; is it today, on Christmas day, that you wish to receive this money? You can wait. - I need it right now! - Why right now? Because it is Christmas night, and I want to buy small boots. For the child. But give a fine pair, an orphan child seldom has the chance to own boots. - It's good! - Then we're set! Where should I stand? Between little Jesus and the donkey. And did you feed him to make him calm? Listen, the child should wear a cap or he'll freeze. In the Alps we have a more difficult life; so Jesus needs to adapt to this life, do you know that? You're all invited to the house of little Jesus in the morning. They are coming! From the Heavens an angel has descended to you, shepherds... I've brought a brother to you, little Jesus: he's orphaned and abandoned just like your people. Please tell your Father to nurture us, because soon there won't be any room in this world even for you to be born. Little Jesus thanks you for your worship. And he's saying through my mouth that the trees which were cut will grow up again; the bird that flied away will return. In place of the dead man a new man will be born. Any sort of misery shall victimise us, we must live in this Earth until the end of the world. It is not me saying this, but God Himself. Go up there and play. Shepherd of the cattle... Guarding in the night field... THE END
