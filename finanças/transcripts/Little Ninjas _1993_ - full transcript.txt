[MEN YELLING] [SHOUTING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE] I am Sarak, soon to be the ruler of Rotonga. If you would live, tell me where the priest has hidden the sacred treasure. No. No! [GUNSHOT] [MEN YELLING] Can't we take a taxi like normal people? I mean, this is not my idea of fun, guys. Oh, Mom, this is better than hanging out at the airport for eight hours. Yeah, Mrs. Campbell. That tourist lady at the airport said this was the biggest festival of the year. Well, maybe so, but did we have to come by this horrible cart? It's kind of rad. You know, even Disneyland doesn't have a ride like this. Well, the next vacation we certainly won't take it in the middle of nowhere. Mom, I told you we were going to the Temple of Penchat. Yeah. They're supposed to have fireworks and a big celebration, even Pencak Silat. Pencak Silat? What's that? It's kind of like karate, you know? Just jungle-style. I don't believe you guys conned me into this. Of all the crazy ideas! Oh! What an ugly... Oh! ...foul-smelling beast! What do they do for excitement around here? [SCREAMING] [MEN YELLING] God! Is it always so hot out here? Oh, what I wouldn't give to dive in a nice pool of water. How much longer? This ride is killing me! I'll sure be glad when we're on that plane headed back to the good old US of A tonight. You guys wore me out. I guess I can put up with it for a few more hours. Besides, it is nice and peaceful around here. Look! There! The Temple of Penchat! -Oh, at last! -Yeah! -Civilization! -Yeah! Whoo! Wow! Tell me where the priest has hidden the sacred treasure. No. No! -Then die! -No! Bring the other one to me! Now, insect, I suggest you tell me where he has put the treasure. -No! -No? -No! -Then die, too! Would you die for something that belongs to the people? Would you deny the people their own? Listen, my son, if you will tell me where the priest has hidden the treasure, I will spare your life. Come join us. We will take care of you. -Uh... -Yes, yes. -The priest has the map. -Yes, the priest. -A map? -Yeah. A map? The priest has a map. The priest has a map. Excellent. The priest has a map. A good, good boy, and we will take care of you. Take care of him. [LAUGHS WICKEDLY] [SCREAMING] Find that filthy priest! I must have that map! BOY: Look! They're doing martial arts. I'm going to browse around, do some shopping, okay? Stevie? Stevie, I don't want you boys going too far. Okay, Mom. Come on, let's check it out. [FOLK MUSIC PLAYING] [INAUDIBLE] Mahmoud, who is that? He is our high priest, Stenda. Keeper of all that is sacred to us. [HUMMING "RULE BRITANNIA"] Oh, great. Food. I'm starving. [IN BRITISH ACCENT] Oh, hello! Oh, you're not from around here, are you? Oh, how very observant of you. No, I'm not. You see, what happened was about 20 years ago, my ship sank not far from here, and I've been here ever since. -I see. -Yes. Well, I'm starving. What is this? Oh, well, have you tried any of these native delicacies? Right. Well, have a go at that. -What is it? -Chicken intestines. Well, um, how about this, then? A nice chicken head? I don't think so. Well, how about a souvenir to take home? Eh, is it food? No, no, no. I've got some nice pots out the back. Now, you come with me and I'm sure you'll find something to take home. That food is all right, you know? You just got to get used to it. You'd like a bite of this. No. No. No. Look, lovely things in this store. Oh, yes. Now, how about this? This little basket. How would you like to take this home? I don't think so. What else do you have? -We have these rugs. -[GUNSHOTS] -And then we have some pots... -What's that? Don't worry about that, Miss. it's nothing to worry about. -Now... -It sounds like gunfire. Well, it's the rebels, miss. They come down from the mountains every so often and attack the village. What? Let's get out of here! [ALL SHOUTING] Wait a minute! No, no, no. Just stay here. You're much safer here, you know? But there's guns. I mean, someone could get hurt. Miss, these are mountain people. They can't shoot straight. [GUNSHOT] Can't shoot straight, huh? -I've got to find the boys! -Miss! Wait, miss! Half price, just for today! [GUNSHOT] Maybe they're just getting better. I've got to find my mom. Wait. Those guys are still out there. Yeah, but my mom! They might hurt her. I don't know, Stevie, she was way down at the other end of town. Yeah. I'd say we're in more trouble. Oh, Mahmoud! I've lost the boys. Yes, miss, come this way. -I got to find them. -Come! We will find them! I wish we would have stayed at the airport, like Mom wanted to. This is all my fault. No, it ain't. We all wanted to come out here. Yeah, that's right. Man! This has been some vacation. Well, it was fun while it lasted. You guys wait here. No use in all of us getting killed. Hold it. You're not going anywhere without us. That's right. We stick together. [MEN GRUNTING] Kill anyone who stands in our way! He's here somewhere, Master. We will search this way. Good. Remember, I have promised great riches to the man who brings me the map. Now go. I wonder who they're looking for. Someone with a map. [SOFT MOANING] Did you guys hear that? Please... Please... You must help me. Beware of Sarak. He's an evil man. Please... Help me. What can we do? Sarak is after the treasure of my people. STEVIE: Treasure? Did he say treasure? Hey, I think he's dead. No, he's still alive. The map. Here. Take it. Is he... That's the map to my people's treasure. You must guard the map with your life. Sarak must never find it. You promise! Who is Sarak? I think he's really dead this time. Let's get out of here. What do we do with this map? Keep it. Yeah. We promised. Hya! The boys! After the boys! [MEN YELLING] [MUFFLED SCREAM] Mom! Stevie, I've been so worried about you. Where have you boys been? What is going on? There's not enough time to explain, Mom. Yeah, Mrs. Campbell. We better get out of here. Hurry! They're coming! Come on! Come on! Come on! Fast! Make it fast! Oh, Mahmoud. -Thank you for everything. -Okay, make it fast! [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE CRANKS] Come on, Mom, hurry! Come on, Mom! [ENGINE STARTS] Throw the eggs! [GRUNTING] STEVIE: Come on! Keep throwing! Flee if you will, foreign dogs! But you will never escape the wrath of Sarak! I will follow you to the ends of the Earth! That treasure is mine! [YELLS] [PEOPLE SHOUTING] [CHEERING] All right. Yeah. Come on, Alan! Yeah! Follow through! Follow through! Come on, get in there! [CHEERING] Hey, the boys are doing a great job, aren't they? Yeah. They worked really hard for this match. Now we have Stevie and Jamie. Yeah, Stevie, go! Look, over there. [CHEERING] Stevie! Yeah! Yeah. It is her, Emil. Yes, no doubt. That's the woman. It is them, the boys that were with the woman. Sarak will be very happy. -Quiet, you fool! -[GRUNTING] You want to give us away? What should we do, Emil? Wait. When the time is right, we will find what they have done with the map. MAN: Next up, Jon and Philip. Where do you think they keep the map, Emil? Quiet, fool! We'll follow the boys, and they'll lead us to it. Excuse me, missy. Yes? May I help you? What time will this be over? Well, it's just about over now. Another 15 to 20 minutes. I notice you're wearing this patch. What does it mean? This is our dojo patch. It's the martial arts federation we belong to. We noticed the children are wearing it. Yes. We belong to the same karate school. EMIL: Hmm, very nice. Are you interested in the martial arts? Oh, yes. Yes, very interested. Where is the school at? Well, here's our business card, and our address and phone number are on the back. Thank you very much. Well, there's our instructor, right there, if you'd like to meet him. Oh, no, no, no. Not at this time. -Where is the dressing room? -Right over there. Admirers of yours, Jackie? Be serious, sensei. -What did they want? -Just asking questions. You know, about the dojo, the patch, and the kids. The usual questions. A couple of strange-looking guys. Yeah, I'll say. You sure it wasn't you they were after? I don't think so. But I gave them your card. [SCOFFING] Thanks. Hey, it pays to advertise. Sensei,they need you up at the judges' table. All right. Hi, guys. ALL: Hi. Hi, Jackie. Congratulations. You guys did a great job. -ALL: Thanks. -So, now what are you up to? My mom is letting me play for a while. Yeah, then we can change and go. Okay, I guess I'll see you later. -Bye, Jackie. -Bye. Bye. Hey. Hey! What are you doing in here? Where are your bags? [GRUNTING] You know, Ken, martial arts has been the best thing for Stevie. He eats, lives, and breathes karate. It's good for him. It gives him direction, it gives him focus. Well, all I know is it's even helped him with his schoolwork. And it's all because of you, sensei. Great. Then I take it you're not here for a refund. [CHUCKLING] Seriously. These kids worship you. Your philosophy and discipline. I just enjoy teaching kids. Well, as a single parent raising a child, I don't know what I'd do without you. Uh, there are no classes tomorrow, right? Right. Good. Why don't you come over for dinner? Okay. -Good. -Certainly beats me cooking. -Well, I wonder where the boys are. -Uh... I think they went to change. Why don't you wait here? And I'll... I'll go check. All right, what's going on here? I think they were robbers. Yeah, that's it. We caught them trying to steal stuff. [MALAYAN MUSIC PLAYS] Come here. Let's go. [GRUNTING] Get up here. Get up here. Get up here. Come here! Master. Master. Idiots. Why do you disturb me now? Excuse me, master, we have information on the foreigners. Yes, master, we found the boys and the mother. Found them? Yes, your excellency. Your information was correct. Well? Did you get the map? We had problems, O great one. Yes, your greatness, we had problems. Obviously, you did not get the map. But what can I expect from two imbeciles sired by a pig and a monkey? Thank you, your grace. Thank you. Yes, thank you. If I may speak, your magnificent. Speak. We can find those foreign dogs. Here. Martial arts? You mean they're at this place? Yes, your reverence. All three boys. All right. This time make no mistake. And if they do not have the map, bring them back to me.

Idiots! Again you have let mere children defeat you. [SIGHING GRIMLY] What have I done to deserve this? To be shackled with two imbeciles sired by a carabao and a goat! But, master, all is not lost. Here we can find the children. In the mountains, alone. This time, dogs, I, Sarak, will do what you were obviously too stupid to accomplish. Yes. We will follow them to this camp. There in the mountains, there will be no one to interfere. I will make these little peasants wish that they had never seen the sacred map. Now, go. Your sight offends me. Zonk, my faithful elephant, I have need of your services. MRS. CAMPBELL: Thank you, sis. Ken, you remember my sister, Sara Jane? Yes. How are you? SARA: Fine. Thanks. Nice to see you again. Okay, boys, what happened yesterday? What's going on? MRS. CAMPBELL: Stevie, tell him. We can't, Mom. We promised. You know, promises are good to keep, but not if it means someone is going to get hurt. Okay. It started on our last vacation, remember? How could I forget? That horrid water buffalo ride. These three conned me into an excursion to the far Pacific. Ken, I told you about the trouble they had down there. I never did figure out what was going on. I was just glad to get out of there. We could tell you what happened. What does this have to do with the men that are after you? Remember the promise? Yes? We promised a man that was dying. What? Yeah. You see, when we got separated, we got thrown into this hut. JON: Yeah, and we saw a man that was dying. And he gave us something to hold, and we swore not to tell. ALAN: Then a big mean-looking man and a bunch of other guys were looking for the man that was dying. STEVIE: Yeah, and we didn't know what to do, so we ran. JON: And they chased us all over the place. [MEN YELLING] All right, food. Hey, guys, let's hide in here. [MEN YELLING] How about a little snack? Jon, give us a break. [WHISPERING] There they are. [YELLS AND LAUGHS] [MAN YELLS] Mom! Stevie, I'm so glad to see you. I've been so worried about you boys. Where have you been? Then that's when we saw you, Mom. That's incredible. Stevie, why didn't you tell me? We couldn't, Mom. We promised. KEN: But where is the map? And this man said that this would show you where the national treasure was? -Yeah. -Yeah. Okay. Why don't you boys go down to the docks and play? Ken, what are we going to do? Look, I've got a friend in the State Department. Let me give him a call and see what ideas he can come up with. Ken, these kids of yours have put the State Department in a very delicate and awkward situation. How's that? Well, with the rest of the world watching every move we make, it's very difficult for us to stick our nose into someone else's business. Here is the file you requested, Mr. Mabry. Thanks, Natalie. What's going on here, Jack? Well, since you called I did some checking on Rotonga. And? The country is in a very unsettled state. Their high priest was killed recently. He was the keeper of their national treasure. The whereabouts of this treasure are detailed on a map. You mean, uh, this map? -JACK: How did you... -KEN: The kids had it. Now, will you take it and do something about this? No way. I've been ordered not to get involved. Not involved? What do you mean? My kids are being attacked and threatened because of this map. I know. But the man responsible for this, Consul General Sarak, and his men are covered by diplomatic immunity. Diplomatic immunity? What does that mean? You can't arrest or prosecute him in anyway? There are over 400 people in this country with diplomatic status, giving them complete immunity from our laws. So, what's the answer, Jack? I can't have these guys coming after the kids again. Someone is going to get hurt. I'll work as fast as I can. Meanwhile, can't you take the kids and hide out for a few days? We do have a Grand Canyon summer camp coming up. Great. By the time you get back I'll have all the answers. I hope so. Well, good luck.
