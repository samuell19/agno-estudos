ONCE UPON A TIME, IN THE FAR FUTURE... The valiant troops of the Suwabeh Clan are ready to fight the Dark Lord's mechanical army. Anticipating the worst, the Suwabeh's generals carried their beloved Princess to safety. The young warriors of the Suwabeh Clan were crushed by the superiority of the mechanical ninjas. All that was left was trying to uphold courage and self-sacrifice in this battle. THE TIME HAS COME FOR THE DECISIVE BATTLE... Charge! Fire! Are you OK? We must flee! Princess... Brother! Brother! Jiromaru! Brother... MIRAI NINJA Your run has come to an end! Try to make one move... ...and your life won't last a second longer. Crane Crest... You must be the one they call SHIRANUI. It doesn't matter who you are. My job is to stop the metal-humans trying to cross this border. Including every mechanical abomination like yourself. Look out! Stop! If you value your life, let it go. For what reason? He's just an ordinary mechanical ninja! The excitement of battle must have clouded your mind. You are so blind that you don't realize that anyone could kill you. Why were those ninjas fighting each other? You really can't tell the difference? This... is an ordinary mechanical ninja. What? Has Shiranui escaped?! I understand... Has he already recovered his memory? Shoki! Again Shoki... ...it seems that Shiranui wants to interfere with our plans. He will try to break into the Demon Fortress. As his loyal servant, the Master has commissioned me to prevent Shiranui from setting foot in the Fortress. My commander, give Shoki the privilege of eliminating Shiranui and the Suwabeh Clan! I admire your courage. At the moment, the enemy's ancestors are busy to perform the blood sacrifice for our Master. We tried to deal with them, but the stakes are too high. The clan members are cunning and ambitious. Therefore, we cannot trust them. I will revenge the betrayal of the Suwabeh Clan with blood. I, the great Shoki, embody the true essence of the Dark Lord's mechanical army. We machines are strong, devoid of human fallacy. We must be proud of this! Shiranui poses no threat! Princess... ...from here on, the path becomes difficult. The sedan chair will be here soon. I hope so... ...or I'll have to walk home! The time has come for the sacrificed soul. Wake up the body of our Master. I feel the euphoria right now. ...it's a sign that our power is growing. Almighty Raimei, tell me. ...the energy that I feel vibrating in my body, will it reach its climax at tomorrow's celebration? Tell me this will happen, please. So it will be! The Gods have chosen to smile on us. Tomorrow, when the moon has blocked out the sun that will be the moment in which we will rise. Victory is now ours. When magnetic radiation have reached it's peak... ...it will be then that the Master will walk among us. Tell me, Raimei... What goes on inside that big oak tree? This pulsating is the nourishment, it will yield the Master being whole again. Until then, it will remain a lump of shapeless flesh. This is why we are forced to feed the oak with human blood. So that the Master absorbs nourishment and purity. Now I understand why our army hunt down the ninjas of the Suwabeh Clan. Order me, Shoki... ...as herald of darkness, to destroy that damned Shiranui! I will bring you his pure blood! You will not do that! We have to be very careful. Listen carefully, Shoki. Shiranui has so much potential... ...things that you can't even imagine. He possesses superhuman abilities. ...so it would be a real shame to waste your efforts right now. How is that possible? Also, Shiranui still suffers from amnesia. The continuing magnetic storms they might restore his memory... ninety two ...so we have to be very careful! Interesting. You chose to spare Shiranui's life. Raimei. I am mortified, my Lord! Maybe I was hasty, but... Well, I thought that. What? Please forgive me, Master. I got carried away from silly meaningless fantasies. However, my lord... Everything I've done... ...it was made for you, Master! I wanted to please you... ...creating the perfect mechanical ninja. As a gift for your rebirth tomorrow. A machine that encompasses... ...spirit and human capacity. That's what I asked you. Please forgive my overzealousness. However, my lord... ...there is no reason to worry. Shiranui lost her memory 3 years ago. During the techno-transmutation... ... I removed all memories of him. Even if Shiranui recovers her memory... ... he will never pass our gates. No enemy will interfere with tomorrow's celebrations. Raimei! Shoki! Whatever happens... ...your life is on the line. Yes, Master! Shoki! The gift for the Master... ... he is now your responsibility! As you wish. This... is what I owe you till now. From now on, you will receive 1 gold piece for every head of a ninja that you bring me. Consider it an incentive. You deserve it! Very good. What's all the rush for? Akagi, why don't you rest for a few days? It would do you good to reconnect with civilization. That's fine, but that's going to cost you too. As you well know... ...the Princess will arrive here this evening, after a long journey to her homeland. She decided to supervise the operations and orders the positioning of the cannon. What? Tomorrow morning, the Suwabeh Clan will attack the Demon Fortress! Now it's all clear... You want me to protect the life of the Princess, while you attack the enemies with the cannon. Akagi, very good insights. What the hell are you raving about? What do you mean? I'll tell you what's going on! This is certainly not the most suitable moment to camp out and wait for the Princess. This plotting makes no sense. You don't want to waste any more time. How dare you? I'll show you something. This weapon... ...is a prototype and capable of firing four shots. But we can implementing a fifth shot. It's a complicated operation... ...but if all goes as planned, we will fire by midnight! Why is such firepower needed? You see... ...we have never used this type of artillery. We are not able to estimate it's real reliability. Would you send your son to fight in a battle without taken every possible precaution? I repeat... if I were in your place, I wouldn't wait a minute longer to test it. Commander! Princess! Princess? What happened to the Princess? They caught her... They have captured the Princess! What? That's devilry... Princess! Don't shoot! How about 50 gold pieces? Half now ... ...and the remaining 25 when I bring you back the Princess alive. Would you be willing to do that? Sure, but... ...50 gold pieces, my friend. My services don't come cheap. Upon your return... ...you will find a mountain of gold waiting for you! One last thing... I need warriors who know how to master their "Kiai". I need... Let's say 5. Trust me with 5 of your men. You want to sneak into the Fortress? Old man, you're wasting your time. Attack before the cannons rust! Won't you need weapons?! You have to do me one favor. There will be a solar eclipse at noon tomorrow. That will be the signal. If we haven't returned by then... - ...fire the cannon! - What about you? If you care about the Princess, do as I tell you! I don't give a damn about the Suwabeh Clan. Even if the Black Falcons were to fall... ...and wipe out the Suwabeh Clan, you have to keep firing! I hate those arrogant machines... ...more than anything else in the world. I'll teach them a lesson! The enemy knows how much you despise him... I wish you good luck. I trust you. Don't forget about the reward! Spies have informed me that men have developed a new weapon... ...and they're pointing it at us. They certainly won't dare to use it now. What's the matter, Princess? Tomorrow, at this time... ...you will become one with the Master. You will be completely reborn in him! How dare you?! I am the Princess of the Suwabeh Clan! Maybe you don't like my hospitality? I hate you... Tomorrow, at noon, it will all be over. And until then? Do you want me to die dressed like this? It's not an appropriate outfit for a warrior princess. I've been too impatient. I have only myself to blame! Now I understand... Just like I had heard. Princess of Suwabeh, to the end! You are fine. You are one man short... That wouldn't have helped! Take me with you... I'm not afraid to die! - Bring me too! - Me too! I implore you! Bunch of idiots! Do you think I want to get killed? I don't need an army to do that! I must avenge my brother's death... It's something that I need to do! Commander... I will fight to the death alongside him! Very well, you will be the 5th member. We leave immediately! Well done! Commander, there's something over there! Commander... ...there are wrecked mecha-ninjas everywhere! Leave them be. This is our current position. From here on, you will enter enemy territory. If we go through this access point we will be exposed to every attack... But if we enter the Fortress from this block, we'll make it to headquarters without any problems. The Flying Chariot? Exactly. The real problem will be. ...getting close, without attracting too much attention. Come on, check your weapons. Yes, sir! Oh... a "Fang-Sword of the Spirit". Is such a weapon not too heavy for you? Listen... ...exchange the weapon for this sword. I'm not pleased with that. This Fang-Sword... ...belonged to my brother! Your brother ... ...he must have been a master swordsman. Indeed! His name was Hiu Kaku... He was the best swordsman of our Clan. Unfortunately... ...he was reported missing in battle and we never found his body. That's why the anger is eating him up. 2 more bodies spotted in the clearing! We must prepare for battle! This way... Pay attention! Beware! Shiranui! We've spotted Shiranui! Why... Why didn't you kill me too? More are coming... This way! Let's move! It can't be Shiranui's doing. That fool is still an incomplete meta-human. I can't believe that one ninja... ...is able to defeat so many mechanical soldiers of the Dark Lord! It certainly looks like it... If he possesses our own mechanical nature, he will feel the Master's victory approaching... ... so he will do everything to prevent it's resurrection, that will reclaim his human body and soul. The tremors are increasing. Our Master's rebirth is near! Go back to the guard posts. We must prevent Shiranui from getting close! What is your story? What will happen when you get your soul back? I'll be human again! After everything that has happened to you, do you really think that they would still accept you as a human being? Not even your own people would recognize you. You betrayed your own Clan... You are nothing but a common murderer! Are you foolish enough to believe that the Suwabeh Clan take you back? I understand... We have to hurry, we don't have much time left! The fact is that. ...the Princess of Clan Suwabeh has been captured. What? Princess Saki? If she would still be alive, where could they keep her as a prisoner? Probably, on the upper level... ...in the "Chamber of Darkness"! The Chamber of Darkness? If you are coming with us... ...would you be able to help us to find the Flying Chariot? I want to steal the Chariot, to breach the walls of the Fortress! Let's destroy their base! Follow me! Let's move! Sir, the gunpowder has arrived! Finally... Load every ounce into the artillery. But, my lord... ...those are 3 gigantic barrels! So? Too much dust? It doesn't matter... give it your all! You are incompetent! However... ...this guard is a waste of time. If we continue to secure this entrance, we will miss the rebirth of our Master! Princess! I should have guessed... You are the cause of this stench! What a waste of time... I have no choice but to kill you. Step aside! My body and my soul are complaining! What are you on about? It's been a while. I already told you to step aside! Do you think I don't know the truth? So is this... ...all that's left of me?! You still refuse to accept the truth. There is nothing left for you here! Your insignificant human soul... ...has become part of this Demon Fortress. Jiromaru! Jiromaru! Jiromaru... How do you know my name? Jiro... but... ru... My poor Shiranui... Together, we could have been invincible. What do you say... Do you still want to redeem your humanity? As long as I was alive... ...you had no hope of getting your soul back. But now... you will be human again. It's done. Prepare the cannon! How dare you to dishonor this sacred ceremony? This is the last time you interfered! ~ HEART ~ Fire! His brother ... ...wasn't his name Hiu-Kaku? Did you know his brother? No, but I've heard a few stories about him. I'm sure he could consider himself a very lucky older brother... ...because of the admiration she had for him a younger brother of such great courage. We have all suffered because of this war. Too many have died for the Black Hawk's treachery. Here with us, lies the saddest of all. His soul is restless ... He'll be looking in the skies for a way to be reunited with his beloved brother. You are wrong. His death was not in vain. So are you...? Whether it's...? Who can tell... We can only let it go. Synch Thai-Tanic
