EPISODE 19 How did you end up in Bali anyway? Because of my brother Your brother? Why? Someone got hurt because of him. So we needed some money to settle. I had to give up my place to get the security deposit. It was a cold winter. It was a small place but nice. I worked really hard to get that place on my own... I got my deposit back and gave the money to him. After that, all I had with me was $1000. It was really cold, but I had nowhere to go. I stayed in motels And kept thinking about what I should do. Then I read an article about Bali in the paper. Some kind of paradise on earth or whatever... And a picture of a girl drinking juice Under a coconut tree. I was so jealous. So I thought maybe I'd better see this paradise before I die. That's how I ended up in Bali.... Wow, you're so brave. But then again, you need money for it to be a paradise. You saw where I used to live, didn't you? Yeah. You know, I still want to go back when I have some money. I miss the sunset in Kuta and my friends... Should we go together? What? I'm thinking of resigning. What do you think? Why do you say that? I don't want to have to see Jung Jae-min again. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I... I really can't forgive myself. That's why I can....never marry you, In-wook... Lee Soo-jung! Lee Soo-jung! Come on, man. Do you mind? Why do you keep doing this? I told you already. Lee Soo-jung is my woman. You should be faithful to your wife if you're married. So... Are you marrying Soo-jung or something? I am. Are you? So get out of my face and stay away from Soo-jung. Maybe you forgot. Soo-jung is a cheap girl I used to play around with. You're content to marry a girl like that? You want to die in my hands? Go ahead and kill me then. Loving someone isn't an excuse for everything else. How can you say you love someone when you don't take responsibility and make sacrifices? You have no idea what I've been through! So your dad beat you a little. You call that a sacrifice? Shame on you. No matter what you say. Soo-jung is mine. You'll see. I'll think about it. Thank you. Coming back from the bathhouse? We could go together. Out of my way. Come on. Oh, boy. He sure has the right taste in women. What? That guy next door wants to go see a movie with me. He says he found me attractive when we met last time. Why do guys always carry you home whenever you're drunk? I'm too embarrassed to face that guy next door. Plus, a married man comes over. And gets in a fistfight over you. In-wook sure is a true gentleman with a big heart. Who could be more understanding? Hey! You watch it. You shouldn't hurt someone who loves you so much. What are you talking about? Ask In-wook yourself if you must know! Hello? Did you have a good sleep? Are you feeling better? It was nothing. All right. I'll call you. What? I'm here to go over your schedule. You have a meeting at 10 in the confrence room. The topic to be discussed is the liquidy of funds. During the presidental election period. Please look this over before the meeting. You're also aware of your lunch meeting with Chairman and Mrs. Choi, aren't you? Choi Young-joo I mean, Mrs. Jung doesn't want you to be late. And at 2, you have a meeting with an agency. Forget all that. Call the distribution sector and have them bring all their financial documents. Eh? Yes, sir. Hey really wanted to meet his son-in-lw this time. But something urgent came up. He had to go to Africa this morning. You understand, don't you? Huh? Everyone knows how busy Chairman Choi is! He kept telling me to buy you a nice lunch. Enjoy your lunch, all right? Yes Young-joo, any news of a baby? Oh, it's too early for them to have a baby! My husband is already waiting for one. Oh, right. Your older son's ex-wife is raising your grandkids. I guess you can't really see them too often. Well, anyway... Young-joo and Jae-min's baby will be so adorable. I can't wait to see their beautiful baby! I'm sorry, but I have so much work to catch up on. Please excuse me. Jae-min. Baby. This is the billiard hall. I'd like to order a bowl of noodles, please. Hey, lady! One for me too. One more, please. Lady, get me some napkins. Why do you keep doing this? Was it marriage you wanted from me? Then you should've told me so! Don't get married to Kang In-wook. I can't let you do that. I can't allow it. Why don't you just clean yourself up? How much do I owe you? $7 plus $3.50 for the noodles. But just give me $10. I'm paying for your noodles, too. See you again. Sir. Come on. Hey. Jang-soo, would it really be all right? Of course! Could Soo-jung really forgive me? Look. I'm Soo-jung's older brother! Soo-jung's a really nice girl. She is? Just trust me, all right? Soo-jung! Your brother's here! Soo-jung! Hey, Soo-jung! Soo-jung! Man, she's still not home. I was told she already left for the day. Let's wait for her over there. Come on. Does she live here? No, this is her friend's place. So, Soo-jung's friend is letting her stay? Yes, you can say that. That's because you took all her money away! I'm leaving Oh, come on. You have to face her someday, right? Maybe you don't know what Soo-jung's like. I do know what she's like! I'm her brother! Okay, once you show her the treasure map. She'll forget everything and forgive you. The treasure...you really think so? Of course! It's so cold... But...we really have to wait here? Just for a little while. Who are you? Me? My sister lives right next door to you. Oh, miss Park Mi-hee? No, not her. Lee Soo-jung. Oh, really? How do you do, sir? Soo-jung! - Hi. - Hey. Guess who's here. Hi, Soo-jung. It's me. Cho Sang-bae! I heard a lot about you. I see. Soo-jung vowed to kill you even in her sleep. I see... Everyone around her causes nothing but trouble, except me. I see.. How could you run away with her money? Well, all I wanted was to invest Soo-jung's money for her. It's over already. Stop it. I'm really sorry, Soo-jung. I really wanted to make it work out for you too. If only the turtles had gotten through customs. I could use the money to start the diamond business. Then the treasure ship recovery business. And the hydroelectric generator business in China. A homeless bum.. the stench... My wife...my children.... But you got me a job and even cooked a meal for me. Just finish eating and leave. Was it marriage you wanted from me? Then you should've told me so! Don't get married to Kang In-wook! I can't let you do that. I can't allow it. When did you get home? Hey, Jung Jae-min! I'm talking to you! I remember telling you not to ignore me. I won't touch you, so I don't want you to touch me either. Don't touch you? Why would I touch you when you're so filthy? Do you know why I like Kang In-wook? He has what they call a spirit. It's something you'll never be able to have. I've never met a guy who's smarter and more attractive than him. That's enough. So, do you know why I married you? Because I have vulgar taste like you do? That's what you think, isn't it? I'm sorry, but you're wrong. That perfect guy pushed me away one day. And he started to love a low-life named Lee Soo-jung. And I married you out of anger. I'm regretting it now, but what can you do? We both chose to get married to each other, right? Where are you going? Tell me! You're going to see Lee Soo-jung again aren't you? What are you doing? I was sleeping. I woke you up then. No, it's quite all right. What's up? I just called. I wanted to hear your voice. I miss living right next to you. Should I move back in? No, I'll just come and see you right now. Wait for me. Hello. Hello. Do you know why I like Kang In-wook? He has what they call a spirit. It's something you'll never be able to have. I've never met a guy who's smarter And more attractive than him. So, do you know why I married you? That perfect guy pushed me away one day And he started to love a low-life named Lee Soo-jung. It's cold out here. Why are you outside? It's late. Why did you come? Right. I was having regrets on the way here. You're waiting, so I couldn't just go back home. Who's waiting? You are. That's because you said you were coming. Fine, I'll go. But I didn't say that you should just leave right now. Well, since I saw you today, I'm all right now. Good night. Wait. Did you have something to say? I wanted to say goodbye. Oh. Sleep tight. I'm really going now. I wonder if Father told Jae-min something... I'm not sure, sir. I think I overheard him talking about a woman. He was grabbing the chairman's feet, talking about love. Director Jung is acting weird these days. I didn't say a thing and yet everyone knows about it now. What about Kang In-wook? According to Soo-jung's brother, he's been going to a billard hall where Soo-jung works. I can almost kill two birds with one stone. He wants to see the financial documents? Thank you. Hello? Come on. I, uh... Welcome. Hello. Hi. What brings you here? We came to eat. Let's go. Go ahead. Okay. What do you want? Anything's fine. Can I help you with anything? No, I'm fine. How are you doing these days? I'm working as a cashier at a billiard hall. A billiard hall. I thought you wanted to come by. It's hard when I run a restaurant. So, how's your boyfriend? Sorry? The one you went out with the other night. The one who drives a foreign car. We're getting married. No, it's not that. Let me handle it. So that's that. Why do you do this to me? I already told you no. You really won't marry me? Why do you make it hard for me? You really won't marry me? No. You're done eating, right? Let's go. Let me have a word with you. Send her home first. She said no. No what? She doesn't want to marry me. So don't worry. What? Thank you for dinner. Good night. I'll be back. Let's go. She seems very upset. Let's have some tea at my place. No. Come on in. Have a seat. Those are from what you told me before. I missed you. Why are you doing this? Whoa. You have a guest. I see. Gee, I'm sorry. I'll just have one drink and leave right away. I'm sorry, but could you just leave now? You're too mean. I said I'll leave after just one drink. I'm leaving. Why should you be? Don't. Sit here. It's me. Can you come pick me up? I'm busy right now. I'm at Kang In-wook's place. I'm too drunk. But In-wook isn't free to take me home right now. You know where he lives, right? I'll be waiting. What are you trying to pull? Can't you see? I really should go. Why? What are you afraid of? Are you worried that Jung Jae-min might be disappointed? Choi Young-joo! Kang In-wook! Come to your senses. You want to marry this girl? You know what she said to me? She told me once that it's possible for her to be Jung Jae-min's wife. Remember that? Are you chasing after Kang In-wook now that you can't have Jung Jae-min? Sleep here, wait for your husband. Or do whatever you want. Let's go. You want me to call you a cab? What? Or should I take you home myself? What? You can impose on guys but not girls? Is that it? Are you finished? Forget it if you do't want me to help. Looks like she'll be here until her husband gets here. Why don't we have some drinks while we wait? You came. Take her home now. Let's go. Wait. Come on! Yes? It's the same as usual. Nothing new. So I should just sign it and give it back to you, huh? You don't think much of me, do you? Dogs become like their masters. Aren't you sticking with me for too long? I'm sorry. What for? For sticking with you for too long. So you really don't think much on me. That's not what I meant, sir. Hi, Brother. What's up? You wanted to see me outside work. What's taking so long for you to say it? Is your project with Kang In-wook going well? Yeah, it's almost over. I hear it involves some investing. What is that about? It's just that some people want to invest in our company. What is it you really want? What? Do you want the distribution sector? What are you talking about, man? Is that why you felt weird about me marrying Young-joo? How can you say that? You knew about Kang In-wook and Young-joo, don't you? I really wanted to know why you brought Kang In-wook. I was sure you wanted to make me fail. So I thought about how it would benefit you. Remember when I asked you if you liked Young-joo? That was the only thing I could think of. But that wasn't everything. How much money did you embezzle anyway? What? You kept the books perfectly. Was it Kang In-wook's talent? I have no idea what you're talking about. You blew tens of millions of dollars on an investment company. And you blew millions on a bio venture company. Uh, I didn't tell the others about those because there's room for misunderstanding. I wasn't the only one in it. I invested with others. And we still have their stocks. Which is worthless at this point. Jae-min, you can't always make the right decisions in business. And that's why Father hasn't said anything so far. In the end, everything worked out for you. You're now in charge of the distribution sector. I'll give it to you. What? Why? Because we're brothers. I'm not kidding. You know me. I'm not interested in running a business. And you'll probably run it better than me. You say you're not interested. But you are. Isn't that why you got married? So that you can be in charge of the biggest sector. You're right. That's what drive me nuts right now. Why? Because of that girl? What's love? Well some people give up their thones, too. So do you want to break up your marriage now or something? You think you can give me your sector after that? You think Young-joo's father will just watch? I think we can help each other out. How? I think you know better how. So, I should play devil's advocate. Please help me. I'll do whatever you want me to do. Then what do you want from me? I don't want anything else. Destroy Kang In-wook. Destroy him so he can never rise again. ENGLISH TRANSLATION BY KBFD - The Asia Network (TAN) Brought to you by WHIB Threaders Timer: lolipss Transcriber: sunshine4ever This is a free fansub.
