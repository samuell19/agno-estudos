Hurry up, son. What is she doing here today? It's only for this week, she had no other free day. Mert darling, don't do that! His name is Mertkan, not "Mert darling". What the fuck are these skaters after, I wonder? Hey, what are you after? And they slip all the time. So stupid... ?ahin, grab us some tea my friend. I really got no money. How about you man? How much did you pay for that? Around 1500... You dumb fuck. Paid for by instalments, man. Doesn't it still cost the the same? I'm downloading some cool stuff. Check it out. Good for you. -Where are you, son? -I'm here, mom. How many times do we have to tell you not to be late when dinner is ready. Where were you today? Went out with Ersan and friends for some tea after work. What "after work"? You weren't around after noon. I was around, father... You just didn't run into me. I'm expecting you in the office at 8 sharp tomorrow morning. You will take the shipment of lumber in the truck to Izmit. Can't Ismail Abi do it? What do you care about Ismail Abi? If I tell you to do it, you will, that's it. Fine, dad. Wake up! Have the decency to close the door, you brute. Mert! How are you? Look, this is my son. So, what are you up to? Working, what else... -Slow down son, what's the hurry? -I have to leave for Izmit mom, you know. So you're working with your elder brother? Yes, I'm working with my elder brother. Then let us leave if you're having breakfast... Alright ??kriye, come again. We'll chat more and have a cup of coffee next time. I surely will. I am so happy to see all of you. Me too. You're looking good too Mert. Take care. What does she want, money? No... she just wanted to visit us. Says her husband is wasting all their money... ... and beats her constantly. She just wanted to get it off her chest. She still smells awful, though. She's a peasant, what can you do. You can't expect someone like that to wear perfume. -All gone? -Yeah. Damn it, dad! Fuck it! Mertkan, welcome. Hello, Irfan Abi. What's up? -I brought the lumber. -You brought the lumber? But we had plenty? Why did you bring them? I don't know, my father sent it. I wonder why he sent them. -Let us call my dad then. -No, no. No need. Kemal Abi must've had something in mind. Your dad knows the business. Slow down, you'll choke. Nah, don't worry. Why don't you bring me two more hamburgers. Is something bothering you? Yeah well... I went all the way to Izmit for nothing. -Well... We'll talk later. -Fine. He sent me to Izmit for nothing. All because I went out for some tea the other day. -Couldn't you still get used to the way dad is? -No I couldn't, Abi. I won't. You got married and saved yourself. You get married and save yourself too, then. Any other way out is hard. Nah, get married at this age? It's too early. And now he calls me to the sauna for this evening. I don't want to. What do I care about going to the sauna. Mertkan, your father is calling for you. Ok, I'm coming. -Why don't you come along as well? -On your way... -...the shipment leaves on Monday, right? -But you have to bring it at 10, the plane leaves at 1... Ok, it won't be like last time... -Go up, son. -But it's too hot there, father. What, so you want me to go up? Just do it. -Kemal Abi, how are you? -Fine, Necmi, how about you? Same old... We buy and sell and try to make our living. Why don't you send some of that business our way as well? You always said you would, all bullshit. But really, I swear I never had the chance. I didn't forget about it. Nah, it's fine, I'm just teasing you. -So, how are things with you, handsome? -All is well, Necmi Abi. Then don't just sit there, rub my shoulders. Why don't you get a proper message inside? Why should I, when we have this strong young man here? Ok, rub harder. Stronger! How are you going to protect our homeland if you're so soft? Kemal Abi, when will Mertkan do his military service? He is still studying supposedly. In open-university. Dear sir is studying in a university from home. Forget about it. Just do your military service. You can still study when you come back if you want. Not that he is going to study... Of course... he is busy chasing after girls, right? You wish. He can't even do that. -Mertkan, visit me some time then. -Ok, Necmi Abi. -Dad, I'm leaving. -Ok. -Thanks Necmi Abi. Farewell, farewell. Get dressed and let's go. Hey. Hey! What, you didn't like the sound of my voice? I didn't hear you Necmi Abi. Look, my friend. You can't run away from your military duty. Don't disappoint your father. -What does that have to do with... -I don't care. Stop worrying your father. -Welcome. -Hello. -How are you? -Fine. -What's up mom? -I'm fine. Not even a "hello, how are you" when you come home... Not even a smile when you look at me... What are you going on about? -I'm saying show some intimacy. Are you that bored of us? -OK, just cut it. -When it doesn't suit you, "just cut it". -It's ok mom. -Good for you my son. You be like that too. -Just quit it so we can eat in peace. Dad, I'm going out for a while. I'll park the car inside as well if they moved that car. Fine. That is the entrance to the parking lot, Abi. Ok but was this necessary? And that's how you'll pick up the pieces of your car, you lousy cunts. -Who are those? -Noone. -Why don't you go talk to them? -It's not like that... -Just go talk, maybe we'll get something. -That girl is a waitress, what would I do with her? What the fuck does that have to do with it? It's just so we get some action. Not in this life, man. -Let's tour around in the car, then. -Ok. -Hello. -Hey. -This is Sinem. She works over at the canteen as well. -Hello. -So you're leaving? -Yeah. We got bored, so we'll just drive around for a while. -What are you up to? -We'll just finish our tea and head home. -Alright, see you then. -See you. -So? Arent't they coming? -They're headed home, man. Oh for fuck's sake. -Which way are you headed? Maybe we can give you a lift. -We're going to Ku?tepe. It's a long distance. We can take the bus. Oh well... Alright then, see you. And we almost wanted to fuck those gypsies, can you believe it? -Yeah, you can tell how miserable they are. -Yeah, man. -What's up? -Not much. How about you? -Same. -Why don't you come inside for some tea? -Nah, I'm on my way to work. -Ok. No worries. -We couldn't see you guys again after that night. -We couldn't give you a lift that night... But I can do it this evening if you want. Sure, fine. Give me your cell number if you want, and I can text you when I'm leaving. Sure. 0532 740 ... (preaching) This way... -Straight? -Yes. -Will I just leave the car here? -Don't worry, it'll be ok. Co?kun Abi, you'll watch over the car right? -Thanks. -How are you sweetie? -I'm good. -Mert, this is Emine. -Hello, welcome. -Hey. -And this is Elmas. -Hey. -Why don't you sit. -I'm fine like this. Oh, come on. -What did you do today? -Nothing. -So... Isn't he handsome? -Did you make some tea, Emine? -No, we didn't. Can you do it? Come on, let's go to the kitchen. These are my flatmates. Emine is studying modern dance at the conservatory. How do you "study" dance? And Elmas, is she your sister? No, she is the daughter of the sister of a friend. She's staying with us. -Why? -Problems with her dad. How can someone abandon their daughter somewhere else? Sometimes she stays with us, so she can go to school in peace. Always some sort of quarrel over at their house. That's odd. -Aren't you studying? -I am actually. Sociology at Marmara University. But because of work, I can't really go to classes. -That's bad. -Why do you work anyway? -I need the money. -Where is your family? -They are in Van. I'm alone here. -Isn't it too hard on you? -We try to get along. -Do you really find me handsome? -Yes. I do. Fuck it! I have to go home. How stupid I am. See you later. Fuck it! Damn it! Sorry about that, brother. Fuck off! Who are telling to fuck off, you cunt? You know whose turf this is? I'll fucking show you, motherfucker! I'll fucking kill you, you hear? I'll smash your face in! It's ok, it's fine, he didn't mean it, we're sorry! -I'm so sorry. -Shut up! Motherfucker. -Are you alright? -Yeah, just leave me. -What brand was the radio? -Pioneer. FX 3600. How could I ever leave the car out there. Fuck it. Don't cuss. Where the hell are you? -I'm so sorry father. -Where have you been? You think this is a hotel? -Someone broke into the car. -Where? In the parking garage. We were drinking some... Drink shit! What could I have done? The radio was stolen. I went over to the police station. -How did it happen? -How can it happen, mom? Broke in through the window, stole it, and left. -You want something to eat? -No thank you, I already ate. -When did you eat my son? -I don't want anything mom! -And what is he shouting at me for? -You know he doesn't like it when you're late for dinner. Hello... I'm fine thanks. I went to the police station and filed a report. No, forget it, it has nothing to do with you. Alright... Thanks... I don't know. We'll talk later. As if I give a fuck! My friend, we don't have this type of glass. We'll give the order, should be here by evening and you can take it tomorrow. -Damn it. -You could have taken it to the service at Bak?rk?y, why did you come all this way? -A friend of my dad owns this place, that's why. -Who is your dad? -Kemal ?ztuna. -?ztuna Construction? Kemal Abi is your father? A good man, he is. -What will you do now, go to Bak?rk?y? -Yes. Hang on, one of our guys was also headed that way, maybe he can give you a lift. -Mehmet! -Mehmet has left, Abi! -Sorry, he has left already. -So how do I get to Bak?rk?y from here? You best head down to the main road, then get on a minibus to Kad?k?y then you can get to Bak?rk?y from there. -Taxi would cost too much, wouldn't it? -What are you doing with a taxi, just get on a minibus, it's easy. Could you pass this please? Hello? Good... You? I'm on a minibus to Kad?k?y. I left the car at the service. They didn't have the proper window, the car will stay there till tomorrow. It's nothing, don't worry. No I can't, father is waiting for me at the office. Well... Ok. -Beautiful, isn't it? -Yes, it is actually. -I love you. -Me too. -So tell me, what is your biggest dream? -You tell me first. -To find a handsome man and get married. -To get married? Nah. So I hear you're hanging around with that gypsy? -Nah. We just ran into each other a couple of times. Got her in the car with you and all... You doing her? -Nah, man, just dropped her at her house a couple of times. -They are miserable bitches, man. You should just fuck them and dump them. Nah. We just hang around from time to time. You should fuck them for sure. It's still better than being horny all the time. But nothing serious. What should we do? Tour around? Over to Taksim? Now that we're high as well. Nah, it's nice here. Wow, that's almost a statue. -What would you like to listen? -Doesn't matter, whatever you want. -I have foreign music as well if you want. -No, this is fine. What kind of contractor are you? There isn't a single book here on architecture. -We don't need books. -So who draws the buildings? We have two architects at the office, they do. -Oh, mom. -Thank you very much. I hope you enjoy it. -Want me to share some of my music with you? -Sure. -Welcome. -Hello. -My father. -Good evening. How are you, sir? -Thank you. How are you? -I'm fine. Thank you. -Are you leaving? Why don't you stay for dinner? -Yes, why don't you? No, I can't. I mean, next time, I hope. -Alright darling, however you want. -Let me just drop G?l off at the bus station then. -Ok. -Where is you girlfriend from? -Just a friend of a friend. What business is her family in? -Don't know, never asked. But her family isn't here. -Where, then? I asked her... But I forgot. -Where is this girl from? -I don't know dad. But I can ask again. How can someone not know where the person they are dating is from? I... forgot, I told you. -What is this? -A present. Where did you get this? -I haven't read a book in my life, how can I read this? -You don't have to read it all at once. You can always look something up and learn something. Maybe one day you will be the one drawing those buildings... Maybe this book will give you some ideas. But we never build these kinds of buildings. Thank you anyway, though. Kemal Abi, we're almost done. Just another 7-8 days of work to finish off these walls. -Then on to plumbering. -Looks good, Erol. Let's look upstairs as well. Sure, Kemal Abi. -So, did you finally learn where that girls is from? -She's from Van, father. -Off with her then, my boy. -What does that have to do with anything, dad? We don't know her family, what she eats, drinks, how she makes money. Nobody knows who the fuck she is. Just break up with her. I didn't like her. I don't want to see her again. I'll check upstairs and be right back. Fuck off! Yes, mom? I'm on my way. -Why the long face? -It's nothing. So this is such a terrible burden for you, to help me carry these things? After I went shopping for you? And you treat me like this? -Mom... -What? Did you ask me once if I needed anything while you were coming home? Never. As if I'm a servant. I'll cook, I'll shop... -I should just leave and not look back, but I'm still a mother... -Mom, it's not about you. -Then tell me, what is it about. -Forget about it. Yes, I would be surprised if you actually shared something with me. You just be quiet. -Father doesn't want me to be with G?l. -Well, do you? I don't know. I think I do. You don't even know what you want. To this day I haven't seen you actually want something. If you father doesn't approve of it, he must know something. Don't cross me with him. Hello. How are you? Were you asleep? I'm sorry. I couldn't sleep. What did you do after I left? I'll just let you sleep then. Me too. -What's the matter, mom? -Nothing. I couldn't sleep. -Why? -Forget it. Don't you worry about it. -Why are you upset with me all of a sudden now? -Not with you. With myself. For raising such an insensitive child at my home. For ending up among such heartless people. What are you blabering about this time of the morning, mom? Thank you very much. -You like it? -How can I tell? I haven't watched it yet. -Some very nice shots in that. -Ok, let's watch it some time. What are you doing out here in this cold? -What is she doing there? -Elmas is working today. You mean she's begging. -Well... we call it working. -Really... -You already hardly get by, and then you have to deal with this? -Come on... You would do the same. -Let's go to your place. -No, let's stay here. It will be dark after an hour and I have to take Elmas back home. -Let's go to the car then, it's cold. -Why don't you like it here? Let's just stay here. -Nah, I'm leaving then. -Ok... As you wish. So, my pal is taking me out for the night huh? But we have to make a stop on the way, need to get some weed. Sure, man. -Want anything to drink? -No thank you. -You come here often? -Don't know. Sometimes. The entire road was empty, and you ended up crashing into me. What kind of driving is that? I don't understand. What am I going to do now? -Alright, Abi, we'll figure it out. There isn't much damage on your car anyway. -What are you talking about? You crashed halfway into my car. I'm sorry. What the hell did you do? Your licence will we suspended. Since this is your first time, for six months. You're lucky noone was seriously injured. You were driving under influence, and your traffic insurance is out of date. You should pay for our friend's troubles. You are at fault here. You figure out how between yourselves. Goodnight. -Abi, can we talk about how we will do this? I need the car as soon as possible. -We will take care of it. -Ok, but I can just send it to my service and send you the bill. -Since we're paying for it, we will see to it that it's repaired at our place. -They'll call you when it's done. -My friend, why are you talking to me in that tone? -Go on then, let's not argue at this time of the night. Come on. You go out. You get drunk. You cause an accident. And why is that insurance not renewed? You dog! I'll break your fucking bones! Abi, the motor has been displaced, the front console slipped back, the chassis is out place... A lot of damage. Hard to say anything. Call the auto insurance and ask when we can get the money. -What do they say? -They can pay for it immediately. But they will "recase" it afterwards because I was drunk. That's called "recourse", idiot. Fuck it, do you see what I have to deal with now because of you? Look at me. Go find that cop at the station, ask him to fix the accident report, then give it to the insurance company. -How do you mean? -Are you not listening? Find that cop, ask him nicely to fix the report that says "driving under influence". Send the papers and the report to insurance after that's done. -Alright, dad. Hello. What's up? I'm on the road, can I call you later? No, nothing's wrong. -Who's calling? -Ersan. -You sure? -Yes. That thing of yours is over, right? How can I help you? Officer, I know it's hard but... Can we get this driving under influence part erased from this report? -No, we can't. -Are you sure? Can't we rewrite it? No, we can't. This is already written. You should have thought of that before. Can't we figure it out somehow? If we make a donation to the station or something? Please, just mind your business. You couldn't sort it out, could you? Alright, just leave. -Good evening, how are you? -Good evening. -What's up? -Since you weren't picking up the phone, I thought I'd come here to visit. But maybe that was not such a good idea. Yeah well... I was in an accident. What? Are you ok now? Were you hurt? -No, I'm fine, thanks. Want me to call you later? -Yes, sure, fine. See you later. Come over here, let's talk a bit. Look, my son. You're at an age where you have to make bigger, more serious decisions. You will do your military service soon. You'll come back and get married. You will take over our business. Therefore you should be careful how you pick your friends. You should just hang around with people who are like yourself. We are all Muslims, Turks, you should be with people who are worthy of our family. Of course you should hang around and live your life. But at the same time you should watch out for you are hanging around with. Look, each day I go to work for you and our nation, to make something worthy and honorable, to make more. Soon you will work for your own wife and kids. But you should always watch out for which crowd you're in, so we don't break each other's hearts. People like these, they seek to divide our nation. Being with these people will hurt us all. Alright, my boy? -Why did you turn on the motor beforehand? -For the noise. It has antifreeze anyway... -You busy over there? -Oh, no, brother. Come sit. -Hello. I was looking for Kemal Bey. -Just a second. Kemal Bey, someone here to see you. Abi, the car isn't done. Right rear door won't close, the front is all messed up. Can we have it looked at again? -Stop it with all the begging. -What are you talking about, begging? I make my living with that car. Two other families as well. -Here. -But I didn't ask for your money. We can't understand each other. -Look my friend, you took the money, just leave. What else must I do to get you off my neck? -What the hell do you think I am! You motherfucker! Get the fuck out! Let me go! And you, go get that report, we had it fixed. -Where from, dad? -From Necmi's shop. Here. If you can't find it, just call. Hello? Necmi Abi, I'm here. I'm in front of Muhterem Kilim. -Over here. How are you young man. -I'm fine Necmi Abi. Come inside. -So? Any news on your military service? -I don't know still... Later. -Later? But your father said you would quit school and do your military duty. There isn't much left, I'll just finish up and then go. Here. -You would make a fine commando you know. -What are you saying, Abi? What? Aren't you going to fight on the mountains? We'll see... God willing... -Can I get that report from you, Abi? -What's wrong? What's your hurry? No hurry, I just wanted to get it over with. Next time, keep in mind: Something like this happens, you call me first. -Ok, Abi. Thanks a lot. Farewell. -It's nothing, take care. Salutations to your father. Why don't you hug me? I missed you. I'll just leave. -Did I bore you? -No. Not at all. -Then why are you leaving? -Don't know. I just wanna go. -Ok, ok. I won't speak about the taxi driver again. -Fuck the taxi driver! When will this sickness of yours pass? -Why? Will you come back then? No. I didn't say that. Hello my little sister, does G?l live here? -No. She doesn't. You know where she moved to? We don't know. It's been a year since she moved. She stayed here for only a month. We don't see her anymore. -And you don't know either? -No. I don't. -You sure? She's not here? -Look, we told you, she's not here. Be on your way. -Who was that? -I couldn't make out. Sounded like Ferit Abi. -Has he left? -I don't know. -Who the hell is Ferit? -A friend of my elder brother, from the village. -Why is he looking for you? -They want to bring me back. I'm still studying. I'm not leaving no matter what before I graduate. -He's walking away, slowly. -Maybe you should wait a bit before you leave. He will come on to you as well. -He can't do shit to me. -Just call me a cab here. -We don't have their number. Go down to the street, there you can find one. My brother. Sorry. Could you wait a minute. I want to ask you something. -Yes? -Do you know G?l? -No, I don't. -You sure? -No, I don't. Who the hell is G?l? -Just look at me. If that little whore called G?l is living here, I will motherfuck you all, you hear? Just go, Abi. -Where to? -Bah?elievler. If you didn't have the money, why did you come all this way in a taxi? -Just wait two minutes, I'll get it and come back. -Really? How do I know this is actually where you live? -Why don't you believe me? -Shut it. Call them and tell them to bring the money here. -Abi, I really live here, let me go and I'll get it. -I said call them! Mom, I'm stuck down here in the taxi, I'm out of money, can you bring me 20 liras? The driver didn't trust me. If you were to just get out and leave, how would I ever find you again? I'm not saying you would do it, but how would I find you? This is Istanbul after all. It's full of scum. -Why didn't you let the kid go? -Abi, how could I know he would bring back the money. -Shut the fuck up and take your money, you ponce! You think we are thieves? -Watch your mouth! You watch your mouth! Just get down here so I can break your face! So, when you got no car, you go around in taxis, you dog! No, father, there was no minibus where I was, that's why... -Where? -In Ku?tepe. -What the hell were you doing in Ku?tepe? -A friend of mine lives there... Are you still seeing that girl? I went to break up... -What are you doing in the dark? -Listening music. What's the matter? -You want some fruits or something? -No, I don't want anything. Please don't do this to me. I will find a flat all by myself. We will meet more often. You will stay over. It's got nothing to do with staying over. I'm not saying we should break up. Just take some time apart. Don't you love me anymore? Of course I do. -So? -It doesn't work, G?l. -I want to be alone for some time. -But I'm not a burden to you. -How will we take some time apart? -I will call you, or you call me. -But I would call you right away. -Then I will call you. -Are you frightened of the man that came over? -No, what's that got to do with anything! -So, what? -We're not breaking up. I'll call you. -When? -I don't know G?l. I don't know. Please. Don't leave me. -How are you mom? -Good. -What's wrong, mom? -??kriye died. -What happened? -They were hit by a car while crossing the street. With her kid. God rest her soul. -What's wrong with you? -??kriye died. God rest her soul. -What are you lying there like that for? -Nothing. Just lying down. -Ersan, my man. Remember that bitch you called a "gypsy"? -Yeah? -I fucked her, you know. -You lousy prick. I fucking knew it! Long and hard too. -You fucking asshole, did you fuck a communist then? -What communist? Of course, those poor cunts are all communists. Where was she from? -Van, I think. -They're all the same, I tell you. -So, what happened then? -I left her. You did good, man, don't worry about it. You should fuck them and dump them. Come on. -Hello. -How much? -How many are you? -Four. -Nah. I wouldn't do him. -Why the hell not? -Nah. I didn't like him. -Alright, he left anyway. -Hundred for each of you. -No way, that's too much!. -Why, how much would you pay? -Fifty. Alright darling. G?l! G?l! G?l isn't here. They took her away. -What do you mean they took her away? Who? -Some men from the village. You saw him too, remember? -What, how? -Her phone is turned off. -I'll fuck that guy up! Where the hell is he? -Fuck off! Instead of talking shit you should have protected her! Only now you remember to ask about her? You cowardly fag! -Hey, you! You think this is the toilet of some pavilion? -Father, I'm really sorry. -Don't "father" me! Wake up, quickly! First clean this... Get up and wash your face, I'll clean this. What sort of drunkenness does this? I'm sure you are doing drugs. Drinking doesn't do this. -Yeah, like you would know. -Then tell me where you were tonight. -Yes? -I'm leaving for the estate, you come over there as well, you hear? Fine. So, mister Mertkan. All this is too much. You've become a nuisance. So, until things are set straight, you will stay at the site in Gebze. And stay there until construction is complete. Then, off to military service you go. -What about school? -Don't get me started! Going to university from the post office, my ass. This monday, you go and delete your registration. Then off to the military office you go. People are dying for our nation over there, while our dear sir is messing around over here! What makes you so special? Even I don't have the balls to do that. Alright. Fine. It'll do me good. I'll rest my head a while. Loudmouth prick. You are going home. I'm headed to Tuzla for lunch meeting. I'll see you at your brother's for dinner. And get a proper haircut before you leave. Your plate please, father. -For how long will you be going to Gebze? -Don't know, father decides that for me. -Stop shit talking about me, you prick! -Calm down, father. Shush, the kid is with us... ...Until the military announces where I'll receive my training, I guess. So, finally you will wield a gun. -Where are you going, my son? Finish your dinner first. -Look at that brave little man! Come here! -I'll go to the army as well! -Of course you will! When it's your turn. Open your mouth. Here it comes! -You can't drive back and forth every day from there, can you? -Of course. He will stay there. -I love watching "Lionheart", Selin. -Me too, mom. Orkun watches football all the time, so when the series starts, I just run away to the other room. Welcome Mertkan! You have brought your luggage with you this time I see! Come inside, come... Come, Mertkan. We prepared this room for you. My office is right next to the construction. -If you need anything, let me know. -Thanks, Abi. -Here, take a good rest. -Thanks, Abi. -I'll be at your door at 7:30 in the morning. -Why so early, Abi? Well, that's when the workers start the day. If you want, you can come in a little late. But Kemal Abi didn't tell me anything of that sort. Suit yourself. -Alright. -Goodnight, then. To you too. Hello? How are you mom? I'm fine. I just came through the door. It's nice. It has a toilet. A kitchen. Father thought of everything... It's ok, don't worry. I ate with Irfan Abi at a joint. Yes, it was good. Alright mom, I won't starve. I don't know. I should stay for a while... Alright. See you. Fuck it! Mertkan! We're here. Mertkan, come on, let me show you around the construction. -Irfan Abi don't you have an extra computer around here. -No, why? -Maybe I would need one, to check our transfer logs or something... -Which transfer logs? -Don't know, For materials and stuff... -I have those records at my computer. You can check from there. -It wouldn't be bad if we could get one for me as well though... -Well, we can ask Kemal Abi later. -Nah, it's not that important -Come on then. -Power to your elbow! -Thank you! (Speaking Kurdish) Fuck! -Mertkan, come eat with us if you'd like. -No Irfan, I'm good over here. -Alright, enjoy it then. -Thanks. -Enjoy your food. -Thanks. -Come on and join us. -No thanks, I've already eaten. -Who built this part? -I did, Abi. -It looks crooked to me. -I just built it Abi, it's straight. Nah... -Why didn't use more mortar on this, are you dumb? -Abi, this is how this is normally built. -Stop bullshitting me... -Mertkan, Mertkan! This is how it's done! -Just cut it. You will rebuild it. -But why? I don't care! Mertkan, I oversee everything that is being built here. If you have a problem with anything, come talk to me. -Why are you getting involved with peasant workers? -If they are workers, let them know their limits. I don't disrespect anyone here, and noone can disrespect me. And stop defending them to me! Hello, mom. What's up? Fine. Is my father home? Can you put him on? Hi, dad. I'm fine. I was gonna ask you something... This construction site is pretty crowded... Noone can know who gets in and out... Maybe we should... Get a gun here... You know, with all the workers around... No I just felt that way... Nothing happened. Alright, as you see fit. Can I come back for the weekend? Alright. If I leave early on Friday, maybe I can make it for dinner. OK. Goodnight. My friend. Wait a minute. I swear I won't do anything. Alright, what can I do, what's done is done. So the car is not getting fixed. I'm not going to take your life, am I? My son! -What's up dad? -All good. Come on in. You brought your laundry, right? Let's wash them right away. -What happened to your cheek, mom? -There was a spot, they removed it. Cut out a small piece from my leg and implanted it there... -Nothing serious, right? -No, no... Comes with old age. Hand over your laundry to me. That thing you asked about, it's ready. You can take it when you're leaving. -Mom, all this is so delicious. -What else, my son is back home.
