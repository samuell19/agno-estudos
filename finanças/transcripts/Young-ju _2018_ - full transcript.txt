Young-in. What if... Really, what if... we could have either mom or dad back, who would you choose? I choose dad! Because he promised a trip abroad when I turn 20. What's gotten into you? Hey, you little... I said, "if". Whatever. Hey. Hey. Come on, tell me, do you like having an older sister, or not? I cook, do the laundry and clean for you. Besides, I'll be paying for your college tuition. I'm not interested in college. - Hey! - Stop it! Hey. I said stop! Stop watching that. You can't talk to your older sister like that! Is it fun, huh? Well, is it? - Huh? - Come on! Huh? I said, stop! Young-ju! Come in. Excuse us. Come in, come. This is the storage room. Redevelopment talks are on. The prices have been hiked up, it won't fall. This is the best time to buy and sell. Right. So the price is... This is the smaller room. This way... Aunt. About selling the house, I need more time to think. You agreed last time. What is it again this time? Even if you apply for apartment ownership, you can't afford monthly rent for a new apartment. It's better bargaining higher if someone's buying. You can't live here forever like this. Young-ju, listen to your aunt. Leave these things up to the adults. Get out of our house! Why you little rat! Get off of me! Hey, Ju Young-in! You little rat! - Young-in! - Come here, come here, hey! You punk! Come here! Hey! Stop it, stop! - Hey, hey! Keep still! -Young-in! Keep still. Keep still! - Stay still for God's sake! - Oh my! Are you okay? What's wrong with you? Awe shit... Young-in, I can understand since he's still underage. But you're turning 20 soon, aren't you? Twenty's basically adult age. That means you need to act like one. I can't believe how na√Øve you are. You guys are just kids in grown-up bodies. And that worries me so much. From now on, consider me your mom and share everything. But I'm not a child... What's that? I said, I'm not a child anymore. So I don't need a mom. You think the house is yours? I was just being nice since I felt sorry for your dead parents. And this is how you pay me back? It's our house! This house is where mom, dad, me and Young-in, the four of us lived as a family all these years. Stop there! Hey! Should we sell the house? Come and eat some night snack! You'll get your daily wage when we're done. Your call is being directed to a voicemail box and will be charged after the beep. Young-in, where are you? It's mom and dad's memorial. Hurry and come home. Hello? You're Ju Young-in's guardian, right? Kang Ji-hoon, Woo Gi-jeong, and Kim Dong-hwan are a team. Lee Hee-chang and Ju Young-in joined in later. They scattered after the crime, but were caught on camera. Until the final ruling, they'll be detained at the Juvenile Classification Review Center. The penalty can be reduced if you settle beforehand. You'll need money for that. What if we can't reach a settlement? You need to submit proof of the parent's ability to support the family and practice correctional measures for your child. For the judge to be in your favor, there's no other way. - Thanks for everything. - Don't mention it. Please look after us. Excuse me. I'm Ju Young-in's guardian. I don't have a job. And no money to settle. Don't you have adults at home? You really must think I'm a pushover, right? At first you rejected my help, and now you want it when it's an emergency. I promise to pay you back. I swear. Pay me back? Like what? How? The man who killed your parents was sentenced for involuntary manslaughter. Do you know that it landed us with a measly settlement? With that, I had to pay your parents' loan debt, and take care of you kids. There's no money left to help you out. Besides, I've lost all my patience with you kids, got that? Go. That's all I've got to say. Any last words? Then leave! (Credit loans up to $50,000) How may I help you? I'd like to take out a loan. I see. And how much do you wish to take out? $3,000. Ah, $3,000? Small sums under $10,000 can be processed immediately. May I have your wage payment bank account and ID number? My wage payment bank account... I'm currently unemployed. Ah, can you wait just a moment, ma'am? The green light is on. You may cross the street. Thank you for waiting, ma'am. As I have checked, for small sums under $10,000, you're required to pay the interest in advance, which is 30% of the total loan amount. And this should be wired within 30 mins. Please enter the recipient's account number for the deposit. Please enter the amount to be transferred. ($900) (Thank you for using Speed Capital) ($3,000 will be transferred in 10 mins) (Bank account number Your balance) The number you have dialed is not in the directory. Please check the number and call again. Aren't you coming out? (Decedent: Ju Sang-wook) (Inheritors: Ju Young-ju, Ju Young-in) Hello, this is Daebak Realtors. Ju Young-ju, you must be out of your mind... (Written Judgement) (Petition) (Honorable prosecutor, I am the younger sister of) (Ju Sang-wook and the sister-in-law of Jeong Eun-sook) (who died on April 20th, 2012 in an accident with a dump truck) (It is hard to accept the ruling) (How can a murderer of killing 2 by dozing while driving) (receive just 18 months in jail and 3-year probation?) (Our family has been living in despair since the tragedy) (The left children are just 14 and 10 years of age) (It breaks my heart to think they will live without parents) (We absolutely cannot accept the ruling) (Please file for a retrial) (August 21st, 2012, The legal representative of Ju Young-ju) (Her parental aunt, Ju Sang-mi) (Written Judgement) (Seoul District Court Ruling) (Violation of act on special cases) (concerning the settlement of traffic accidents) (Defendant Kim Sang-moon) (Address: Jangan 1-dong, Dongdaemun, Seoul) Seung-il. Mom's going out. Sang-moon. Eat. - Say thank you. - Thank you. Good job, sweetie. Have a nice day. (Hiring part-time) Excuse me... You're... hiring... right? (Seung-il Tofu) Come. Eat up. I'm fine. Let her have it all. Why are you eating so little? Feeling bloated again? Need any medicine? Where did you hide it? Hyang-sook. Go somewhere I can't see if you're going to smoke. Young or old, men are so foolish, aren't they, Young-ju? Say hello, Young-ju. This is Mr. Park. From now on, she'll be delivering. Oh my, she's just a baby. Are you sure she can handle the job? Of course. she's not like the kids these days. She's pretty shrewd and easygoing. I trust your judgment. This is for you. (Seung-il Tofu) Ma'am, I'll be off. Thanks. Have a relaxing weekend. I'll see you on Monday. Yes, ma'am. Young-ju, come here. Just for a second. It's from today's stock. So there's nothing wrong with it. Take it to share with your family. Uh, you don't have to. It's really okay. It's getting hot, so I can't sell leftovers anyway. Oh, wait. (2PM tomorrow Guardian Interview) (Attendance mandatory Classification Review Center) (Guardian, Ju Young-ju) The guardian must prove his or her ability to support the family. You should submit your proof of employment, and 3 months of your 4 major insurance payment receipts. Excuse me. I'm working part-time, but I'll soon get a new job. I see, you don't have a fixed income. You've settled for $3,000. It's better the transfer's done before the final ruling, okay? Sit here. Young-in. Look at me. It's okay. Just trust me. I'm so sorry, Seung-il. I'm so sorry, Seung-il. Sir, it's... Young-ju. Seung-il... It's me, Young-ju! I'm so sorry... Seung-il... Sir! You?! Eat, okay? Eat... okay? Look at you. (Closed Temporarily) Young-ju! Young-ju. Seung-il. Dad will be out of the hospital soon. Isn't that good news? Do I seem weird to you? He's still conscious, so he can hear everything. Can you stay with him for a moment? A long time ago, my husband drove a truck. And he caused a car accident, and did time in prison. It was around this period. So when he gets drunk, he just loses it. He blamed himself so much, he even slit his wrist. Even I was filled with so much resentment, but as time passed, I realized it's no use blaming anyone. They say, that day, if he was discovered too late, it would've been serious. Young-ju. I need you to know, I'm so grateful. So I'm okay about that other thing. I... I'm so sorry. I wasn't sure how much you needed. So I just stuck in a bit. It's not a handout, so no need to feel bad. You can take your time to pay me back. Young-ju. You're a good kid. I can tell. Seventy three... Seventy four... Seventy five... Seventy six... Seventy seven. Seventy eight. The victim has settled and given he's a first-time offender, who's also deeply remorseful, the defendant will be under 6-month custody of his guardian, along with 1-year probation, and 3-month night curfew. Next. You must be really hungry. What are you craving for the most? I'll treat you to anything you want. I'm the best big sister, aren't I? Should we order chicken? Or pizza? You don't need to pay back but for god's sake, don't be a burden. Your father wouldn't have approved. Hey. Why you little...! Awe, shit! Hey! You little bastard! Hey! Come out! Come out! Young-in said he's sorry! That he'll never do it again! It'll cost your sister's happiness to come around, right?! It really hurts, doesn't it? Let me see. Give the settlement money back to them. I don't mind serving time at the Youth Detention Center. I'm sure dad wouldn't have approved that either. Stop it. Young-in. Let's make things better. Let's try to live a better life. Just give them back. The money didn't come from our aunt. My boss at work gave it to me. she said I could take my time to pay them back. Why would they do that? They're good people. Fill it up. That's it. (Homemade Dumplings) You'll be good at anything you do, Young-ju. Eat. Young-ju. Would you like to have dinner at my place? I'll cook you something nice. How about spicy chicken stew? Or grilled meat? I have to eat dinner at home... Oh, okay, right. Then, I'll pack you some stuff to share with your family. Anything else you're craving? Huh? Just tell me. Finish it. What do you need? Just a block of tofu. Don't you have just one son? Uh, she's... my youngest daughter I kept hidden. When did you give birth to her? What a pretty daughter you have. Right? She looks just like me. Uh, Young-in! It's your sister. I'll be a bit late. You can set your own meal, right? Everything's in the fridge, so grab something to eat. Yeah. Young-ju! Here. Cheers! From next week, I'll let you off early, so apply for the GED and continue your education. You've got a bright future ahead of you, Young-ju. Try everything you can. I'll help you, okay? I really want to. Hi. The spring night's pretty chilly. Here. Young-ju, why are you dressed so lightly? Aren't you cold? Here. Let's give our Young-ju a hug. Stop being such a fuss. You must be drunk. I am drunk, so what? How nice. I feel so alive. It's my son, Kim Seung-il. - It must've been hard for you. - Huh? I don't mind. It's all my fault that he became that way. Young-ju. Busy day today, wasn't it? It was okay. It's been so long since I saw her smile like that. The fact that you came to us is a blessing. Hey, you'll hurt yourself. Young-ju! Come over here. It's pretty on you. It's my gift to you. Hello? Young-ju, you want me to wait? Huh? Young-ju! What is wrong with you, huh? You promised me! What's the matter with you? What am I going to do with you? When we responded to a street fight complaint, he was alone lying on the street. I see he's on probation. You should pay more attention. Young-in. Young-in. What is it? What happened? Who beat you up? Tell me. Young-ju! Who's that? Your poor face is a mess. You'll need a good excuse to keep your parents from worrying. Yes. Right. Okay. Our parents are dead. When did that happen? They... died so suddenly when I was in middle school. It must have been tough. Young-ju. Thank you. I'll see you tomorrow. He's the one who gave you the settlement money, right? You know, he looks kind of familiar. I want you to stay home until your probation's over. I mean it. Okay? Ju Young-in, answer me. Are you embarrassed? What? Why didn't you tell him that mom and dad are dead? Is that why you never told him about me? Because I embarrass you? Because I might mess up your life as well? Do you want me to just disappear? Shit... You're right! My only brother makes me want to die of shame! Since you know so well, you can always shape up so I wouldn't have to be! At least, you need to give a try! (Written Judgement) I'm back. Good job. It's him, isn't it? Your boss. You can't just come here like this. You're putting me on the spot. Sis! Don't you get it?! I know. What? I said, I know. Go! Why aren't you wearing mom's clothes? I'm sorry about the tofu. Who cares about the tofu? I'm glad it didn't get any worse. Go home and rest. Don't worry. Were you hurt somewhere else? Young-ju. Look at me. What is it? Look at me. I can stay here, right? It's okay for me to stay here with you, right? Of course. Of course it is. It's no big deal. Don't worry, okay? Were you afraid I'd tell you to quit? Our Young-ju is such a baby. Young-ju, I want you to quit your job. I'm tired. Let's talk tomorrow. Ju Young-ju! I said, quit that place! No. Are you out of your mind? We couldn't have settled if it weren't for them. We should be grateful. But he's the jerk who killed our parents! So what?! We just have to go on with our own lives, that's all. I'm sure he's suffered enough. - So... - Are you taking his side? How can you bear seeing his face everyday? Don't you feel sorry to mom and dad?! Why should I feel sorry? Shouldn't mom and dad be the ones feeling sorry? What did they ever do for me? How dare they just die like that? Why did they have to die and make my life so hard? Besides, those people say they like me. That they're proud of me. And so they want to help me with any difficulties. Unlike our parents who died and left us, they're the people we need more than them. Does he know whose daughter you are? I guess not. I'm going to tell him. You think they'd accept you after they find out? Why wouldn't they? I told you they said they like me. That I'm like a daughter to them. How would you know? How the hell could you... Then tell them now. What? Call him then. And tell him, you're the daughter of the folks he killed. If he still says it's okay, then I'll let it go. (To Mr. and Mrs. Kim) (I apologize for quitting so suddenly) Mr. Kim. Five years ago... Do you remember the people who died in the truck accident? Young-ju... They're... my mom and dad. At first, I really resented you. I wanted revenge. I thought it was okay. Because you're the one who killed my mom and dad. But... I just couldn't. Because... I... really like you both. That's why I wanted to tell everything. I no longer want to lie. The room's chilly since it hasn't been used. It'll warm up in no time. Sleep here tonight. Will Mrs. Kim be okay? (You are wrong, Young-in) I envy you. In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Our Father who art in heaven. To the son of Peter, Kim Sang-moon and Elizabeth, Moon Hyang-sook, Paul, Kim Seung-il, may God's grace come upon thee. Please give your blessing to our poor Seung-il. And... I pray for Young-ju. Please care for her wounds, as we know of our sins we've committed to her. Please let me bear... the cross until the day I die. Amen. In the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. Hyang-sook. What are we going to do? Huh? What? How... are we supposed to face her again? How can we bear facing her? We shouldn't have cared for her... We shouldn't have met... Ever. Why did she have to come to us? What are we going to do now? I'm so sorry... So sorry... Poor thing... I'm so sorry. Mom... Mom... (Youngju)
