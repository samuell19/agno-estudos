( film projector whirring ) TV narrator: THE SURF IS UP AND SO IS THE PASKOWITZ FAMILY. AND TODAY, AS EVERY DAY, THEY'RE GOING SURFING. THIS IS THEIR BASE CAMP, IN THE SHADOW OF THE NUCLEAR POWER STATION JUST SOUTH OF SAN CLEMENTE. DORIAN PASKOWITZ IS A 58-YEAR-OLD DOCTOR. HE'S A GRADUATE OF STANFORD MEDICAL SCHOOL WHO ONE DAY DECIDED TO GIVE IT ALL UP, CLOSE HIS PRACTICE AND SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE TRAVELING WITH HIS FAMILY IN A TINY CAMPER FROM ONE WAVE TO ANOTHER. ( camper squeaking ) Juliette Paskowitz: I CAN'T EVEN GO BACK THERE BECAUSE I MUST HAVE DONE A LOT OF IT SLEEPWALKING. I MUST HAVE DONE A LOT OF IT AND BLANKED IT OUT. FOR 10 YEARS I WAS EITHER PREGNANT OR BREASTFEEDING WITHOUT ONE DAY OFF. DAVID WAS BORN IN '59. I AM WHAT GABRIEL WAS TO GOD. Juliette: JONATHAN WAS BORN IN '61. BETA MALE-- BASICALLY LAY BACK, WATCH THE ALPHA MALE DO EVERYTHING, AND THEN WHEN HE NEEDS YOU MOST AT THAT ONE MOMENT-- THAT'S WHEN YOU KICK HIS ASS AND BASICALLY TAKE THE PRINCE'S CROWN AND MOVE FORWARD. Juliette: ABRAHAM-- '62. I WAS THE LITTLE LOVER. I WAS THE SOFT ONE. Juliette: IZZY-- IN '63. ( board squeaks ) SEE? WE ARE SAVAGES. Juliette: MOSES WAS BORN IN '64... ...IN KAPIOLANI HOSPITAL BY DR. NISHIJIMA AT 2:38 p.m. ON SEPTEMBER 26th, THE YEAR OF OUR LORD 1964. Juliette: ADAM-- '66. MY DAD TRAINED ME TO BE ONE OF TWO THINGS: EITHER A SURFER OR-- WELL, THREE-- A BUM OR A ROCK STAR. Juliette: SALVADOR-- '67. I WOULD SAY THAT MY ROLE WAS PROBABLY, UM... OH... A NERD? Juliette: NAVAH-- '69. I'M NOT A BROTHER. I DON'T HAVE A DICK. Juliette: AND JOSHUA BEN-- IN '74. I MEAN, WE WERE BORN 'CAUSE DOC WANTED TO REPOPULATE THE WORLD WITH JEWS. ( laughs ) THAT'S FUCKING HARDCORE, MAN. I KNOW SKINHEAD PEOPLE LIKE THAT. THROUGHOUT ALL OF OUR LIVES TOGETHER WE HAVE BEEN KNOWN AS A VERY UNUSUAL FAMILY. WE HAVE BEEN KNOWN AS DIFFERENT. AND IT'S THE GREATEST DISHONOR AND IT'S THE MOST UNCOMPLIMENTARY THING YOU CAN SAY ABOUT ME, BECAUSE IN REALITY WE WERE THE MOST CONVENTIONAL OF PEOPLE. Dorian: A SEA WAVE IS LIKE ALL OTHER WAVES-- AN ENERGY FROM AN ENERGY SOURCE-- THE STARS, THE SUN. IT BREAKS DOWN AND MAKES THIS HOT AND THAT COLD, MAKES THAT POWERFUL GIANT STAR OVER THOUSANDS OF SQUARE MILES. SO IN A WAY THAT LITTLE WAVE HAS IN IT SOME OF THE WISDOM OF NATURE, OF THE UNIVERSE. AND THEN YOU CAPTURE IT. Steve Pezman: I THINK DORIAN IS THE ULTIMATE SURFER. JUST THE ESSENCE OF THE RIDE AND THE CAMARADERIE AND THE CULTURE THAT SURROUNDS THE WAVE IS SOMETHING THAT DORIAN HAS SPENT HIS LIFE ADORING AND TRYING TO TRANSMIT TO THE WORLD AROUND HIM, BOTH SURFERS AND NON-SURFERS. BUT HE'S SEEN AS AN EXTREMIST AND BY SOME PEOPLE AS TOTALLY IRRELEVANT PROBABLY, AND BY MYSELF AND A FEW OTHERS AS PERHAPS MOST RELEVANT. THE PASKOWITZ FAMILY IS THE MOST WELL-KNOWN FAMILY IN SURFING. Taylor Knox: THEIR VISION IS SHARING THEIR LOVE OF THE OCEAN AND HOW HEALING IT CAN BE. Mark Occhilupo: IT'S A REALLY GOOD MESSAGE BECAUSE IT'S ALL ABOUT HAVING FUN. THEY'RE JUST SUCH A BIG FAMILY AND THEY JUST BRING SO MUCH LOVE INTO THE SPORT. WE GET CAUGHT UP BECAUSE IT'S A LIVING FOR US, BUT WE'RE STILL HAVING FUN, ESPECIALLY ON OUR OFF DAYS. THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING EVERY DAY. ( laughs ) ( sportscaster commenting ) ...THAT WAVE, A BEAUTIFUL SOFT TURN, AND DOWN THE ESCALATOR... ( distant car alarm blaring ) ( car alarm stops ) ( chanting in Hebrew ) GOOD MORNING, MOMMY AND BABY. GOD BLESS YOU AND KEEP YOU. MOMMY AND BABY, HELP ME BE ALERT THAT I MAY BE OF SERVICE. WELL, MY DEAR FRIENDS, THAT'S FOR BETTER OR WORSE WHAT I DO. MY PRAYERS MAY NOT BE CORRECT. I DON'T EVEN HAVE THE FAINTEST IDEA WHO GOD IS. I DON'T THINK ANYBODY ELSE DOES. TO ME GOD IS A SQUARE PEG IN A SQUARE HOLE. AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO BE. MY NAME IS DORIAN PAS-KO-WITZ. I'M ONE OF THE FEW DUMB JEWISH DOCTORS THAT YOU WILL EVER MEET. I'M 84 YEARS OLD AND I'VE GOT ALL KINDS OF THINGS WRONG WITH ME: I HAVE A LITTLE EMPHYSEMA FROM 80 YEARS OF ASTHMA; I HAVE ATROPHY OF THE MUSCLES OF THE LEG; I HAVE PROSTATE TROUBLE, BLADDER TROUBLE, OSTEOARTHRITIS OF THE SPINE, A COMPLETELY OSTEOARTHRITIC HIP. BUT I DON'T TAKE ANY MEDICINE, NONE AT ALL. INSTEAD, I'M TRYING TO SHIFT THE THINGS THAT I DO TO BE EXTRA MODERATE. IN OTHER WORDS, I TRY TO BE AS HEALTHY AS POSSIBLE, AND THERE IS THE KEY. HEALTH IS MORE THAN A MERE ABSENCE OF DISEASE. IT'S THE PRESENCE OF A SUPERIOR STATE OF WELL-BEING, A PIZZAZZ, A VITALITY. IT HAS TO BE WORKED FOR EACH AND EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE. YOU CANNOT GET IT IN A BOTTLE OR FROM DR. PHIL. IT'S GOT TO BE GOTTEN THROUGH DIET AND EXERCISE AND REST AND RECREATION AND ATTITUDES IN LINE, WORKING ALL TOGETHER EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE. AND THEN YOUNG MEN CAN BECOME SUPERMEN AND OLD MEN CAN BECOME OLDER. ALL I DID AS A CHILD WAS SURF. MY FATHER DIDN'T CARE WHETHER I WENT TO SCHOOL. I DIDN'T CARE IF I WENT TO SCHOOL. MY MOTHER COULDN'T CATCH ME WHEN I WASN'T GOING TO SCHOOL. SO I GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL WITH A "D" AVERAGE. DORIAN IS CRAZY, OKAY? I SAY THAT LOVINGLY. HE'S EXTREME, VERY EXTREME. AND YEAH, HE'S BEEN A REBEL IN THE FAMILY. AND THE FAMILY HAS NOT KNOWN HOW TO HANDLE HIM. Sonia Darrin: HE DEVELOPED A CERTAIN ATTITUDE, A CERTAIN PHILOSOPHY. AND EVERYTHING HE DID INVOLVED THAT PHILOSOPHY. Dorian: I WAS BORN ON MARCH 3, 1921, IN THE LITTLE ISLAND CITY OF GALVESTON, TEXAS. I MOVED TO SAN DIEGO WHEN I WAS 13 YEARS OLD, IN 1934. THE FIRST TIME I EVER SURFED WAS ON A VERY STRANGE SURFBOARD UNDER THE TUTELAGE OF A DEAF-MUTE LIFEGUARD BY THE NAME OF LEROY COLOMBO. Adam: THIS IS SANO. WHEN MY DAD CAME OVER THAT HILL-- 30-SOMETHING, 39-- HE FOUND THIS SLOPPY, MUSHY WAVE AND IT BECAME HIS SWAN SONG. Steve Pezman: THERE WERE MAYBE HUNDREDS OF SURFERS IN THE WORLD AT THAT TIME, VERSUS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS. JUST BY BEING ONE OF THAT GROUP DORIAN CAST HIMSELF AS A BOHEMIAN AND AN ESCAPIST AND A ROMANTIC OR... YOU KNOW WHAT DORIAN LOOKED LIKE WHEN HE WAS 17, 18, 20? CHARLES ATLAS. MY GOD, HANDSOME, TANNED MUSCLES, DOING HANDSTANDS ON THE BEACH. HE WAS A LIFEGUARD THERE. YOU KNOW, THE GIRLS WOULD BE DROWNING... ( laughs ) AND BEING RESCUED. THEY WANTED TO BE RESCUED BY HIM. Adrian: HE WIGGLED HIS WAY INTO STANFORD, GOT HIS M.D. THERE AT AN EARLY AGE. Dorian: I BECAME A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER IN THE TERRITORY OF HAWAII. Rabbit Kekai: THE FIRST TIME HE CAME, HE OPENED A SMALL LITTLE PRACTICE RIGHT IN THE BACK OF DAIRY QUEEN AND HE TREATED ALL THE BEACH GUYS, YOU KNOW, FREE OF CHARGE. DORIAN TOOK THE HIPPOCRATIC OATH TO HEART. Dorian: I WILL NEVER ENRICH MYSELF WITH THE LIVES OF SICK PEOPLE. HE WAS JUST ANOTHER BEACH BOY, LIKE THE REST OF US. Rabbit Kekai: A LOT OF THE GUYS DOWN THERE, THEY'RE POOR, BUT DOC JUST STRUGGLED. HE STARTS TO SURF THE BIG WAVES WITH US EVERY PLACE WE GO. HE WAS FIRST MARRIED TO ELIZABETH. THEY HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE-- PARENTHESIS-- SEXUALLY. WE WERE ALL IN A GROUP OF SURFERS TOGETHER IN WHICH WE HUNG OUT, LIKE WALLY AND GEORGY AND WOODY. AND THERE WAS A JAPANESE BOY. AND I DIDN'T KNOW HE WAS FUCKING MY WIFE. AND HE MARRIED ANOTHER GIRL, HALF-JEWISH. AND SHE WAS VERY TRADITIONAL. SO DORIAN GOT AN OFFICE AND GOT A BUILDING... Rabbit Kekai: AND HE GOT TO BE WELL-KNOWN. AND THAT GUY GOT TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION IN HAWAII. Adrian: A WHITE JACKET, WHITE PANTS, A NICE TIE-- HE WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL. Moses: DORIAN WAS PART OF THE BRAIN TRUST OF AMERICA THAT TRIED TO GET THE SMARTEST PEOPLE ON EARTH TO WORK FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT. HE WAS A STANFORD DOCTOR, YOU KNOW, CUM LAUDE. HE WAS ASKED TO RUN FOR THE GOVERNORSHIP OF THE ISLANDS OF HAWAII. HE WAS A REAL WINNER. IT WAS THE LOWEST POINT OF MY LIFE. YOU KNOW WHAT PANIC SPELLS ARE? THEY'RE THE MOST GOD-AWFUL THING IN THE WORLD. YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA DIE AND YET YOU-- YOU DON'T. AND YOU HOPE THAT YOU'LL DIE SO THAT YOU'LL BE FREE OF IT, AND YOU DON'T. I WAS HORRIFIED WHEN I LET MY HEAD DOWN ON A PILLOW AT NIGHT: "PASKOWITZ, YOU'RE A FUCKING FRAUD. ARE YOU GONNA LIVE THE REST OF YOUR LIFE LIKE THIS? YOU'RE A FAKE. ALL THIS SHIT IS NOTHING. YOU DON'T EVEN SURF ANYMORE." YOU KNOW, THE THING WAS, DORIAN WAS NOT TAKEN SERIOUSLY BY A LOT OF HIS CONTEMPORARIES. DORIAN WAS DIVORCED FROM MOST OF THE REALITIES THAT THEY WORSHIPPED, WHICH WAS ACCUMULATING WEALTH AND STORING ACORNS. AND DORIAN HAD A LOT OF TROUBLE ACTING IN A CONVENTIONAL MANNER. Woody Brown: HE WASN'T INTERESTED IN BEING A BIGSHOT. HE WAS INTERESTED IN DOING THIS THING AND HELPING US ALL. Adrian: SO WHEN DOCTORS SAW THIS QUALITY WHERE HE WAS EMPATHETIC THEY WERE TELLING HIM, "YOU'RE IN THE WRONG PLACE. YOU'RE A BEACH BUM. GET OUT OF THIS THING." Dorian: I HAD LOST MY SECOND WIFE. I HAD WATCHED MY TWO BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRLS WALK AWAY FROM ME. AND I SAID TO MYSELF, "GOD ALMIGHTY, WHERE AM I?" SO IN 1956, AFTER YEARS OF INSOMNIA, AFTER YEARS OF ANXIETY, I EMBARKED UPON AN ODYSSEY TO FIND MY ANSWER TO WHO I WAS, WHAT I WANTED TO DO IN LIFE, AND SETTING OUT A PLAN TO DO IT. SURFING RECREATES YOU. I HAVE GONE INTO THE WATER LITERALLY READY TO BLOW MY BRAINS OUT AND COME BACK OUT OF THE WATER A WARRIOR. SO I LET MY MAID GO. I LET MY APARTMENT GO. I LET THE GUY THAT WASHED MY CAR GO. AND I DECIDED TO TAKE A TRIP TO ISRAEL. THIS IS DORIAN PASKOWITZ. WHEN HE CAME TO ISRAEL, IT WAS SOMETHING AROUND '57. Dorian: I WENT OUT INTO THE DESERT LIKE JESUS OF NAZARETH OR A LOT OF OTHER SCREWBALLS AND LIVED LIKE AN ANIMAL. I GOT MY FOOD OUT OF THE SEA. FOR ONE GOLDEN YEAR I WAS HEALTHY. AND SO... AND I TRIED TO BECOME A PARATROOPER IN THE ARMY AND THEY LAUGHED ME OUT OF THE ROOM. AND I SAID, "WELL, FUCK 'EM. I'LL GO GET MY BOARD AND GO SURFING." Jonathan: HE TAKES HIS SURFBOARD, PADDLES OUT, CATCHES A COUPLE WAVES. ALL OF THE LIFEGUARDS CAME UP TO HIM. THEY ALL WANTED TO LEARN HOW TO SURF. HE TAUGHT THE REAL HEROES OF THE TEL AVIV BEACH SCENE HOW TO SURF. Orian: TOPSY, DORIAN AND SHAUL. THE KIDS-- THREE WAVES. ALL OF THEM HERE-- THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW I STAND ON THIS PIECE OF WOOD, YOU KNOW. AND FROM THIS PLACE ALL THE SURFERS GROW. Dorian: I WAS GETTING BETTER BECAUSE I WAS SURFING MORE. AND THEN I MET A JEWISH GIRL NAMED ELLEN AND WE KIND OF GOT TOGETHER. AND SHE TAUGHT ME TO EAT PUSSY. AND THAT CHANGED MY LIFE A GREAT DEAL. MY LIFE AS A HUSBAND HAD BEEN VERY POOR. AND I REALLY FELT THAT MY LACK OF KNOWLEDGE OF SEX WAS THE THING THAT HAD MADE IT SO. I DECIDED TO TAKE A TRIP AROUND THE WORLD MAKING A STUDY OF THE PSYCHOSEXUAL DEVELOPMENT OF WOMEN. HE ACTUALLY FUCKED 25 WOMEN AND TOOK NOTES. Dorian: I THOUGHT I WOULD TRY TO FUCK 100 WOMEN CONSECUTIVELY AND GIVE EVERY GIRL A TEST. EVERYONE GETS A SCORE CALLED A "MALE DEFICIT SCORE." DAPHNE THE VIRGIN WAS AN 85. ROCHALA POLLACK WAS A 78 AT MOST. CARMELLA GOLDBERG WAS A 90. AND THAT'S WHEN I FOUND JULIETTE. AND THAT WAS THE END OF MY RESEARCH. I WAS JUST APPALLED AT THE HIGH SCORE. MY NAME IS JULIETTE PASKOWITZ. I WAS BORN IN LONG BEACH, CALIFORNIA. MY PARENTS ARE FROM MEXICO. THE FIRST TIME I SET EYES ON DOC HE WAS THE MOST UNIQUE PERSON I HAD EVER MET. I KNEW I COULD NOT LET HIM GET AWAY. I WAS GONNA HOGTIE HIM SOMEHOW. I WAS 26 YEARS OLD, SITTING AT A BAR WITH A FRIEND OF MINE, A GIRLFRIEND. DORIAN WALKED INTO THE BAR. HE WALKED UP TO OUR TABLE AND HE STOOD THERE - AND HE STARTED ASKING ME THESE QUESTIONS. - Dorian: FIVE QUESTIONS. AND THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN HE LOOKS AT ME AND HE GOES, "YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU MAY BE THE MOTHER OF MY SEVEN SONS." AND I SAID, "WELL, MY MOM HAD NINE." ( laughs ) AND EVERYTHING DISAPPEARED IN THAT ROOM EXCEPT ONE ANOTHER. WE WERE JUST SO ENTHRALLED. WE MOVED INTO HIS STUDEBAKER-- ( laughs ) --OUR FIRST APARTMENT. HE FIXED IT UP. HE PUT A BED IN THE BACK, A PIECE OF PLYWOOD ON THE ROOF AND ALL OUR SUPPLIES, A SURFBOARD. AND WE HEADED FOR MEXICO. Dorian: AND I SAID TO MYSELF, "I DON'T CARE ABOUT BEING A GREAT DOCTOR OR A RICH PERSON OR A CELEBRITY OR ANYTHING ELSE. I JUST WANT TO BE A GOOD HUSBAND AND A GOOD FATHER, THUS A GOOD MAN. Juliette: ONE EVENING WE WERE PARKED, BAHIA SAN CARLOS. HE SAID TO ME, "TOMORROW MORNING WE'RE GETTING MARRIED." I ACTUALLY STARTED TO CRY. I WAS SO HAPPY. AND BY THEN I WAS PREGNANT. ( crickets chirping ) ( baby crying ) ( many babies crying ) Moses: NINE CHILDREN LIVING IN A 24-FOOT CAMPER. FROM THE AGE OF 23 PRIOR, I DON'T HAVE ANY RECORDS. EVERYTHING WAS DESTROYED, KIND OF, IN THE FRAY. THESE ARE SOME OF THE PICTURES OF THE FAMILY THAT I'VE SAVED. MY DAD WAS BEATEN DOWN SO HARD BY HIS PREVIOUS LIFE OF TRYING TO BE A REAL DOCTOR, A REAL PERSON, THAT HE REALLY DECIDED THAT THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF THE CORE FAMILY WAS BASICALLY SOMETHING TO BE VERY VERY CAREFUL OF, KIND OF IN AN AMISH SORT OF WAY. Moses: DORIAN RAISED HIS CHILDREN TO BE LIKE WOLVES. 'CAUSE THEY COULD ADAPT ANYWHERE YOU PUT 'EM. I DON'T KNOW IF A WOLF CAN DO THAT, BUT I KNOW THE PASKOWITZ FAMILY COULD. Abraham: HE WANTED US TO BE UNCHAINED TO A MORTGAGE, TO A BANK, A CAR PAYMENT, WHATEVER, AND JUST AT A MOMENT'S NOTICE JUST TO GET IN AND GO, AND LEAVE, LEAVE IT ALL BEHIND. THE NEXT ADVENTURE IS ON ITS WAY. David: WE'D WAKE UP ONE MORNING AND WE'D BE IN PENSACOLA; WAKE UP ANOTHER MORNING-- WE'D BE IN CORPUS CHRISTI; WAKE UP ANOTHER MORNING-- WE'D BE IN SAN ONOFRE. SOMETIMES WE'D BE DRIVING NORTH AND THEN DORIAN WOULD SAY... "I DON'T KNOW. THIS DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT." HE'D TURN THE CAR AROUND AND START DRIVING SOUTH. AND HE'D SAY, "THERE, THAT'S IT. WE SHOULD BE GOING SOUTH." ( groans ) ( voices overlapping ) SAN FRANCISCO, BAJA, FLORIDA, VENEZUELA, NEW MEXICO, ALABAMA, EL PASO, MAINE, VIRGINIA, MALIBU, SOUTH DAKOTA. Juliette: WE'D JUST GO-- SPUR OF THE MOMENT-- GO WHEREVER. ONE DAY I'M LYING IN BED AND I HEAR THIS SQUEAK-KGHH, SQUEAK-KGHH. AND I LOOK OUT THE WINDOW AND HERE COMES THIS GOD-AWFUL HUNK OF METAL. AND THEY COME UP TO THE DRIVEWAY... ...AND THEN THE DOOR WOULD FLY OPEN - AND HERE THEY ALL COME. - HERE THEY COME. Navah: AND THEN A BUNCH OF, LIKE, HALFBREEDS, NAKED AND WILD MANIAC HAIRDOS... ...AND THEY'D NEED A SHOWER AND FOOD AND STUFF LIKE THAT. Navah: WE WERE ALL SO CLOSE. I MEAN, I GUESS THAT'S WHY WE ALWAYS WENT SOMEWHERE WHERE MY DAD COULD JUST OPEN THE DOOR AND LET US JUST SCATTER. OPEN THE CAMPER DOOR-- "GO OUT AND DO YOUR THING. LUNCH IS AT NOON." Phyllis: IF YOU WENT INTO THE PASKOWITZ MOTOR HOME, JULIETTE WAS ALWAYS SWEEPING SAND SAND SAND. BUT SHE ALWAYS HAD BEAUTIFUL FRESH FLOWERS IN A VASE AND SHE ALWAYS HAD OPERA MUSIC ON, ALWAYS. JULIETTE HAD THE MOST MAGNIFICENT CONTRALTO VOICE I HAD EVER HEARD. AND EVERY SINGLE DAY SHE WOVE MUSIC INTO THE FABRIC OF OUR LIVES. Juliette: AND AS WE TRAVELED WE TAUGHT THEM ABOUT OTHER CULTURES, THE WAY OTHER PEOPLE LIVE, THE DIFFERENT FOODS. AND WE WOULD READ FOR HOURS, JUST QUIETLY READING. Dorian: I WASN'T SOME KIND OF AVANT-GARDE RADICAL INTELLECTUAL. I JUST WANTED MY KIDS AROUND ME, SURFING WITH ME, AND EDUCATION BE DAMNED. Juliette: IT SOUNDS GOOD TO SAY WE WERE ONE STEP AHEAD OF THE TRUANT OFFICER, YOU KNOW, BUT THAT DIDN'T REALLY HAPPEN. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T GO INTO THE SYSTEM... THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW YOU EXIST. Salvador: THE KIND OF THING THAT YOUR PARENTS WOULD HAVE SAID: "YOU CAN GO TO SCHOOL BECAUSE IT'S SAFE BUT DON'T GO SWIMMING WITH SHARKS 'CAUSE IT'S DANGEROUS." OUR PARENTS SAID, "NO, YOU CAN GO SWIMMING WITH SHARKS, BUT YOU'RE NOT FUCKING GOING TO SCHOOL, 'CAUSE THAT SHIT'S DANGEROUS." ( laughs ) ( bangs ) Younger Dorian: THEY DO GO TO SCHOOL. THEY GO TO A SCHOOL WHICH I CONSIDER TO BE ENORMOUSLY MORE DEMANDING THAN A PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM OF ANY COUNTRY WE'VE BEEN IN. ONE THING IS, I DEMAND THAT THEY SURF WITH GRACE, WITH CHARM, WITH KINDNESS, WITH COMPASSION, AND THAT THEY BE GOOD AT IT. Phyllis: WELL, I MEAN, THEY WON EVERY CONTEST. FIRST, SECOND, THIRD, FOURTH WOULD BE A PASKOWITZ. MAYBE A TUBESTEAK WOULD GET IN THERE FIFTH, IF THEY WERE LUCKY. ACTUALLY, A TUBESTEAK WOULD HAVE WON IF THE PASKOWITZES WERE IN DAKOTA. ( both laughing ) Izzy: MY FIRST WAVE-- TOURMALINE CANYON. I WAS SIX YEARS OLD. I WAS BORN IN '63, SO... IT WAS THE FUCKING SUMMER OF '69, MAN. ( chuckles ) MY DAD TOOK ME ON HIS 10' BOARD. AND I WAS IN THE FRONT THERE. AND WE TURNED AROUND AND WE CAUGHT ONE WAVE. AND I FELT LIKE WE WERE GOING A MILLION MILES AN HOUR. AND I'M HOLDING ONTO THE RAILS AS HARD AS I CAN. AND WE GO IN-- JUMP OFF THE BOARD AND JUST RUN IN. AND IT FELT LIKE SUCH A HUGE ACCOMPLISHMENT. Izzy: GOING OUT ON THE WATER JUST-- IT REVITALIZES YOU. IT JUST CLEANSES YOU. IT STILL MAKES YOU FEEL VERY GROUNDED AND VERY-- JUST NATIVE TO THE EARTH. GROWING UP, YOU KNOW, OUR BATHS WERE IN THE OCEAN. SO WHEN I'M AWAY FROM IT TOO LONG, MY GILLS DRY OUT. I GOTTA GET WATER IN ME. OH, I GOTTA GET MYSELF BACK IN THE WATER. Dorian: DON'T YOU FIND A CERTAIN GRACEFULNESS IN ANIMALS IN THE WILD? THERE'S CERTAIN GRACEFULNESS IN THE JAGUAR. THERE'S CERTAIN GRACEFULNESS IN A BIRD SOARING. THERE'S CERTAIN GRACEFULNESS IN A GAZELLE THAT LEAPS. I'LL TELL YOU, EVERY WILD ANIMAL HAS IT. IT'S JUST SOMETHING WE'VE LOST. IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE CAN'T HAVE. WHEN MY WIFE HAD MY FIRST BABY, I SAID, "LOOK, I DON'T WANT ANY GORILLA TO DO ANYTHING WITH ITS BABY THAT YOU DON'T DO WITH MY BABY. IF A GORILLA FEEDS ITS BABY FOR TWO YEARS, I WANT YOU TO FEED MY BABY AT THE BREAST FOR TWO YEARS. I DON'T WANT TO BE UPSTAGED BY ANY GORILLA OR ANY CHIMPANZEE OR ANY NEWT OR ANY GECKO OR ANY SQUIRREL." Jonathan: IT'S A HEAVY HEAVY CONCEPT. IT'S ALSO HEAVY TO WATCH A GUY WATCH A BABOON EAT AN APPLE BUT NOT EAT THE SKIN AND THEN MIMIC IT FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE LIKE DORIAN WOULD. YOU KNOW, ONE DAY IN A ZOO HE SAW THAT. AND THEN HE NOTICED IT ANOTHER TIME IN THE SAN DIEGO ZOO-- "HUH, THE GORILLAS DON'T EAT THE SKIN OF THE APPLE EITHER. GOD DAMN IT, WE'VE GOT TO STOP EATING THAT APPLE SKIN." YOU KNOW, THE LAW WAS LAID. Dorian: WHEN A PERSON TAKES CARE OF THEMSELVES IN THE MANNER IN WHICH OTHER ANIMALS TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES, YOU ACHIEVE A STATE OF SUPERIOR WELL-BEING CALLED HEALTH. Navah: YOU KNOW, WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP, HONEY WAS A LUXURY. WE COULDN'T HAVE REFINED SUGAR. WE COULDN'T HAVE WHITE BREAD. WE WOULD EAT PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING EVERY MORNING, WHICH IS THAT GRUEL-- WHICH IS A VERY HEAVY-DUTY SEVEN-GRAIN CEREAL. IT HAS A MIXTURE OF DIFFERENT BERRIES. YOU KNOW, BIRDSEED AND BRANCHES AND SHIT, YOU KNOW-- THAT'S WHAT HE FED US FOR BREAKFAST. AND THAT'S ALL WE KNEW BECAUSE WE WERE IN A CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT. Navah: MY MOM WOULD MAKE A HUGE VAT OF IT. AND MOSTLY WE ATE A LOT OF SOUPS AND WE ATE A LOT OF THINGS THAT MY MOM WAS ABLE TO MAKE. WHEN WE COULD STOP TO COOK IT. SOMEHOW THEY ALWAYS MANAGED TO FEED THESE KIDS. SHE'D JUST DOLE IT OUT, LIKE "OLIVER TWIST." AND THEN ON OCCASION, WHEN WE WERE ROLLING, WE'D HAVE A SCRAMBLED EGG. WHEREVER THERE WAS A PLACE WE COULD FISH, WE DID FISH. AND I MEAN, A FISH THAT BIG WAS A KEEPER. AND THE ONLY THING YOU SHOULD BE LEFT WITH ARE THE TWO HARD JOWL BONES THAT ARE TOO HARD TO CHEW OR SWALLOW. AND EVEN THOSE WE'D EAT SOMETIMES. BECAUSE, LIKE, ABE WOULD SAY, "SCRAPEY SCRAPEY." ( laughs ) YEAH, DORIAN SHOWED ME HOW TO INGEST PROTEIN ONE DAY WHEN HE TOOK A WHOLE FISH AND ATE IT-- HEAD, EYEBALLS, BONES, EVERYTHING-- JUST ATE IT. AND I WAS JUST LOOKING AT HIM, YOU KNOW, IN SHOCK. Adam: I DO WHAT'S CALLED EXTREME SURFBOARD FISHING. BASICALLY WHAT WE DO IS FREE-BAIT WHATEVER WE HAVE AND THEN WE HOOK UP WITH BIG STUFF. THEN WE DROP THE ANCHOR AND WE LET THEM PULL US AROUND. LOOK, HERE'S THE LAST OF MY LIVE BAIT. EAT HIM! ADAM THINKS IF A GREAT WHITE COMES OUT THAT WOULD BE THE MOST EXCITING THING THAT COULD HAPPEN. WELL, IT WOULD SCARE THE HECK OUT OF ME. Adam: I GO ABOUT A MILE AND A HALF OR TWO MILES OUT AND IT'S JUST SUCH A DIFFERENT WORLD. AND THERE'S NOBODY OUT THERE BUT ME. AND IT'S SORT OF LIKE THE ONE THING THAT I CAN DO LEFT IN MY LIFE THAT'S JUST ME AGAINST MYSELF, OR ME AGAINST MY FEAR OR WHATEVER. SO, HERE I GO. MY DAD USED TO GET A BOOK CALLED "OPTION." AND A BOOK WAS ABOUT YAY THICK. AND IT WAS JUST A LIST OF DOCTORS THAT THEY NEEDED AROUND THE WORLD OR AROUND THE UNITED STATES. SO HE'D TAKE THE WORST JOBS FROM THIS BOOK THAT NOBODY ELSE WANTED. THERE'D BE A LITTLE LISTING OF WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME THEY HAD A DOCTOR, AND IT MIGHT BE YEARS. THAT'S THE ONE HE'D TAKE. Juliette: DOC REALLY HATES MONEY. HE BELIEVE THAT IT IS THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL. ONE OF HIS AUNTIES LEFT HIM, I THINK, SOMETHING LIKE 40 GRAND AND HE SAID, "NO. THE WAY MY LIFE IS TOGETHER NOW, $40,000 WOULD CHANGE IT. AND I DON'T WANT IT TO CHANGE." Younger Dorian: WE LIVE WITH DIFFICULTY, WITH HARDSHIPS, WITH DEPRIVATIONS, ALL OF WHICH TO US ARE THE PRICES THAT WE PAY FOR THE THINGS WE THINK TO BE ELEMENTALLY IMPORTANT. WHEN WE BEGIN TO TAKE MORE THAN WE ACTUALLY NEED, I TELL MY KIDS WE TAKE FROM SOMEBODY ELSE. Moses: IN SOME LITTLE TEENY TOWN IN LOUISIANA WE PULLED OVER INTO THE STATE PARK AND HE SAYS, "GUYS, THERE IT IS. WE'RE DOWN TO OUR LAST DIME." YOU KNOW, IT WAS A FUCKING DIME AND HE WAS EXCITED BECAUSE HE KNEW THAT THAT DIME REPRESENTED ANOTHER CHALLENGE FOR HIM AND HIS FAMILY. AND WE PICKED UP THAT DIME AND WE WENT FORWARD. Joshua: ...'CAUSE WE WERE SO EFFIN' POOR THAT THERE WAS NEVER ANY MONEY FOR PRESENTS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. SO AT ONE POINT DOC GAVE HIS CHILDREN "THE SEA," SO TO SPEAK, YOU KNOW. IT WAS, LIKE, A BIRTHDAY DEAL WHERE HE WOULD TAKE THE KID OUT TO THE OCEAN AND HE'D BE LIKE, "SON, I GIVE YOU THE SEA." AND, LIKE, EVERY KID WAS UNDOUBTEDLY DISAPPOINTED. YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? 'CAUSE THERE WERE TIMES WHERE FOR SURE WE COULD NOT HAVE DRESSED EVERYBODY ALL AT ONCE TOGETHER. BUT THERE WERE TIMES WHERE, LIKE, ONE GUY COULD HAVE A BITCHIN' OUTFIT. ( laughs, slaps ) AND YOU REALLY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THAT. THAT WAS HEAVY, DUDE. Navah: I MEAN, HONESTLY, I DON'T REMEMBER HAVING GIRLS' UNDERWEAR. MY MOM WOULD ARGUE WITH ME, BUT SHE'S BLOCKED A LOT OUT. Jonathan: AND WHEN YOU WERE STANDING AROUND, YOU KNOW, 11, 12, 13, 14-YEAR OLD KIDS ALL LINED UP, AND IT'S 6.5%-7% BODY FAT, IT LOOKS LIKE EITHER IT'S A XYLOPHONE CONTEST OR SOMETHING, OR PEOPLE ARE WRONG THERE. THEY'RE WRONG. WHY AREN'T THOSE KIDS FATTENED UP? - WHY AREN'T THESE KIDS IN SCHOOL? - WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU? HOW DO YOU DO THIS TO THESE CHILDREN? WHY AREN'T YOU WORKING TO SUPPORT THESE KIDS? YOU KNOW, WHAT KIND OF PARENTS ARE YOU? THEY WERE SO CROWDED THAT THEY COULD NEVER EVEN TAKE A TOY, AN EXTRA TOY, AN EXTRA ANYTHING. I FELT HE WAS VERY SELF-SERVING IN WHAT HE WANTED. 17, 18... MY THEORY IS, YOU DON'T GET EDUCATED AT STANFORD. WHAT YOU GET AT STANFORD IS KNOWLEDGE. BUT EDUCATION MEANS WISDOM. WISDOM YOU GET FROM EXPERIENCE, LIVING, PEOPLE THAT YOU MEET IN AN EVERYDAY KIND OF LIFE. AND THAT IS WHAT MY CHILDREN HAD A LOT OF. Nina: MY MEMORY BEING WITH THEM WAS ALWAYS THIS INCREDIBLE SENSE OF LIFE AND LOVE AND SHARING AND FAMILY. IT'S LIKE BEING AT SUMMER CAMP. Navah: I'VE NEVER MET A KID-- WHEN WE WERE KIDS, ANYWAY-- WHO DIDN'T THINK "GOD, WHAT I WOULDN'T GIVE TO HAVE YOUR LIFESTYLE." BECAUSE IT JUST SEEMED LIKE WE WERE CONSTANTLY ON VACATION AND THERE WAS NEVER, LIKE, "SIT AND DO GEOMETRY." WE WERE ALWAYS DOING SOMETHING EXCITING. Izzy: WHEN MOST KIDS TURN INTO TEENS AND HAVE TO GROW UP, WE NEVER HAD TO DO THAT. IT WAS INFECTIOUS. IN FACT, A LOT OF KIDS ESSENTIALLY RAN AWAY FROM THEIR OWN HOMES TO COME DOWN EVERY DAY AND ROLL IN THE DIRT WITH US. AND PEOPLE LIVING IN BIG, BEAUTIFUL RICH HOMES WOULD GET IN THEIR BRAND NEW SUBARUS, DRIVE DOWN TO THE BEACH AND, YOU KNOW-- "ROLL WITH ME. I NEED LOVE." THEY SAW THEIR ESCAPE ROUTE. THEY WERE LIKE, "I KNOW I CAN TAP INTO THIS. THEY DON'T OWN THIS. I CAN STILL KEEP MY JOB. I CAN STILL SEND THE ALIMONY TO MY EX-WIFE AND EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE COOL, BUT I'M GONNA TAP INTO WHATEVER THESE PASKOWITZES ARE DOING, 'CAUSE I WANT THAT. YOU CAN'T-- THERE'S NO HALFWAY. Moses: WE WERE PASKOWITZ POWER. "ALL OF US TOGETHER CAN MOVE MOUNTAINS," DOC SAID. AND THAT WAS KIND OF HIS MANTRA: THERE'S NO ONE STRONGER THAN THE WHOLE. IF SOMEONE GOT STUCK IN THE SAND, ALL OF US-- "PASKOWITZ POWER, PASKOWITZ POWER, COME ON, COME ON," AND YOU'D GET 11 PEOPLE TOGETHER AND YOU'D PUSH THE CAR OUT OF THE SAND. David: EVERYONE'S TRYING TO GET THAT SPIRITUAL MOMENT OF PERFECTION. WE HAD IT. WE LIVED IT. WE WERE NOT ATTACHED TO THE PHYSICAL WORLD AT ALL. ( guitar playing ) Man: ? HE WAS A WATER MAN ? ? HIS BLOOD RUNS THROUGH MY VEINS ? ? HE GAVE TO ME A LOVE ? ? THE OCEAN AND THE RAIN... ? YOU SEE, I HAVE A VERY FUNNY PHILOSOPHY ABOUT LIFE. I LOVE TO HAVE MY KIDS AROUND ME. YOU KNOW THEY NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL? SO I SAID, HOW WOULD YOU GUYS LIKE A JOB THIS SUMMER? YOU'LL GET A NEW SURFBOARD, A DOLLAR A WEEK, AND YOU CAN SURF AS MUCH AS YOU WANT." "I'D TAKE IT, I'D TAKE IT," THEY ALL SAID. ( kid chuckles ) SO I SAID, "YOU WORK FOR ME." "OH, I KNEW THERE WAS SOME CATCH." "NO NO, REALLY, YOU WORK FOR ME." I GAVE THEM EACH A DOLLAR. AND THAT'S HOW IT STARTED. IN 1974 WE OPENED UP THE SURF CAMP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. - AND WE HAD GOOD FOOD... - Juliette: NO SUGAR ALLOWED. ...NO DRUGS, NO SMOKING. Juliette: THERE WAS THE SLOGAN THAT SAID, "WE LIVE CLEAN, WE EAT CLEAN AND WE SURF CLEAN." Jonathan: THE SURF CAMP'S DEFINITELY A THING THAT WE LOVED FROM AN EMOTIONAL STANDPOINT, 'CAUSE IT WAS OUR LIVES. OUR HEART AND SOUL AND OUR WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN ABOUT TAKING PEOPLE SURFING. GETTING THE KIDS OUT THERE AND GETTING THEM UP AND RIDING ON WAVES AND LIVING THE DREAM. Abraham: JOHN, THIS IS YOU. YEAH, LET'S HEAR IT FOR JOHN MICHAEL. BEND THOSE KNEES, BIG JIM. YOU'VE GOT TO COMPRESS WHEN YOU DROP IN. Joshua: WELL, WE JUST DON'T ACCEPT DEFEAT FROM OUR STUDENTS. SO, THEREFORE, WE HAVE TO TAKE THEM PHYSICALLY AND FORCE THEM TO SURF. IT'S HARD. THE MIRACLE CAN HAPPEN ON ANY SIZE WAVE. WE'VE SEEN GUYS ON SOFT-TOPS WE'VE TAUGHT TO SURF JUST LOOK AT THE RAIL AND REVEL. AND THAT'S THE SAME LOOK I'VE SEEN ON KELLY SLATER'S FACE WHEN HE GOES-- WHAM! THE INTENSITY OF THE EXPERIENCE IS THE SAME. - Jonathan: ONLY HE'S SHRALPY. - ONLY HE'S THE BEST SURFER IN THE WORLD. TIMES SEVEN TO THE 12th POWER. - TIMES SEVEN TO THE-- - ( spitting ) Kelly Slater: IT'S BEEN REALLY COOL TO SEE SOMETHING THAT WE TAKE FOR GRANTED, THAT WE DO EVERY DAY, ESPECIALLY FOR SHORT-BOARDERS-- THAT WE GO OUT AND WE WANT TO DO A BIGGER MANEUVER OR RIDE A MORE CRITICAL WAVE TO GET THAT EXCITEMENT AGAIN. AND THEN YOU TAKE THIS KID WHO'S RIDING A WAVE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HIS LIFE AND THAT ONE WAVE IS SO EXCITING TO HIM. IT MAKES YOU APPRECIATE RIDING ANYTHING A LOT MORE. JACKSON QUALIFYING FOR THE LAST WAVE. - YEAH! - ( cheering ) LOOK AT THAT BACKSIDE ATTACK. WHOO! OKAY, HERE WE GO. MAX, CAN YOU KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR YOUR BROTHER? BECAUSE HE BARFED ON THE WAY HERE. ( engine starts ) WE LIVE IN ENCINO. I REALLY FEEL LIKE A FISH OUT OF WATER. IT'S A TOTALLY DIFFERENT LIFESTYLE THAT I'VE CHOSEN. AND OF COURSE THERE IS A GIVE AND A TAKE. I GUESS THAT'S PART OF BEING A PARENT. YOU HAVE TO SACRIFICE. AND THE TRAFFIC'S SO GNARLY. TO BE ON 101 YOU HAVE TO, LIKE, PUT YOURSELF INTO THESE LITTLE DAYDREAMS AND HAVE FLASHBACKS TO CABO. WE WERE JUST, YOU KNOW, HALF-NAKED MOST OF THE TIME. WE WERE LIKE WEIRD MONKEYS IN A SMALL MONKEY CAGE, YOU KNOW? ( giggles ) SEE, WE NEVER HAD A RIG LIKE THIS. OUR RIG WAS HALF THAT SIZE. THAT'S A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A RIG WE'VE NEVER HAD. IF WE HAD A COAT OF ARMS, THERE WOULD BE A BUTTOCKS-- AN ASS, A SHINY ASS. 'CAUSE WE HAD A RULE IN OUR HOUSE: WHEN YOU GO TO THE BATHROOM, YOU WASH YOUR ASSHOLE. AND WE ALL HAVE SCRUPULOUSLY CLEAN ASSHOLES. BECAUSE WHEN YOU LIVE IN A SMALL AREA LIKE THAT, YOU CAN'T BE DIRTY. SO PEOPLE COULD CALL US GYPSIES AND ALL, BUT WE WERE NOT DIRTY. Moses: NINE CHILDREN LIVING IN A 24-FOOT CAMPER. I THINK WE HAD AT LEAST TWO OR THREE DIFFERENT CAMPERS GROWING UP. THERE WERE TIMES WHEN WE'D GET A NEW CAMPER, BUT IT WAS NEVER A NEW CAMPER. IT WAS ALWAYS A USED RIG. FOR US, WE WERE JUST LIKE PUPPIES, YOU KNOW. AND THERE'D BE, LIKE, THREE OR FOUR PEOPLE ON THAT LITTLE LOWER BED THING. AND THEN THERE'D BE A COUPLE GUYS ON THE SIDE COUCH BEDS OR WHATEVER. AND THERE'D BE AT LEAST TWO OR THREE ON THE FLOOR, AND MOM AND DAD WOULD BE UP ABOVE. EITHER I WAS ON THIS WEIRD BOARD THING THEY MADE AT THEIR FEET, OR JOSHY, WHICH DEFINITELY SCARRED ME SEXUALLY-- 'CAUSE MY MOM AND DAD WOULD DO IT EVERY NIGHT. THEY COULD CARE LESS THAT WE COULD HEAR. Salvador: MY DAD, BECAUSE HE HAD FAILED WITH HIS RELATIONSHIPS BEFORE MY MOM, CAME TO MY MOM AND SAID, "LOOK, I'M NO LONGER ASHAMED THAT I HAVE THE KIND OF NEEDS THAT A MAN HAS, AND EITHER THOSE NEEDS ARE FULFILLED OR THERE IS NOT A MARRIAGE." FUCKING TO ME IS... THE WORD OF GOD. GOD, WHOEVER THAT IS, HAS DECIDED THAT THE PERPETUATION OF LIFE IN ANY SPECIES HAS TO DO WITH FUCKING. HE COULD BE ON HIS DEATHBED AND HE WOULD WANT TO HAVE SEX. AND I'LL PROBABLY HELP HIM WITH THAT. Salvador: THAT WAS VERY VERY DISTURBING FOR A KID TO HEAR. IT WAS JUST SO DISGUSTING TO HAVE TO HEAR YOUR PARENTS', YOU KNOW, LOUD, WEIRD COPULATION. I WOULD HAVE A TECHNIQUE WHEN MY DAD AND MOM WOULD GO AT IT EVERY SINGLE FUCKING NIGHT WHERE I WOULD FOLD MY INNER EAR, MY LOBE OVER THAT, AND THEN FOLD THIS DOWN AND THEN TRY TO, LIKE, GET A PILLOW OVER MY HEAD BECAUSE IT WAS RIGHT THERE IN FRONT OF ME. AND THEY WERE NOT QUIET. Dorian: WHAT HAPPENED WITH US IS THE SAME THING THAT HAPPENED WITH THE MONGOLS IN THEIR TENTS-- THE PARENTS FUCK AND THE CHILDREN LAUGH AND GIGGLE AND THINK THEY'RE MAKING FUN. YOU WANT TO HEAR SOMETHING HORRIBLE? A CHILD STANDING BEHIND THE DOOR, SEEING THE FATHER BEAT THE MOTHER. ONE TIME I WALKED IN ON THEM HAVING SEX ON THE KITCHEN FLOOR. AND MOMMY'S FACE WAS ALL SWEATY. AND I WAS, LIKE, PROBABLY SIX OR SEVEN OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND I GO, "MOM, MOM, ARE YOU OKAY?" AND SHE GOES, "OF COURSE. DADDY AND I ARE MAKING LOVE," A BIG SMILE ON HER FACE. AND THEN AT THE END OF THAT JULIETTE'S END STATEMENT WAS, "BUT WHEN YOU PLAY WITH-- YOU'RE NOT MARRIED. YOU CAN'T HAVE BABIES. YOU'RE JUST A BABY, SO FINGERS ONLY." WE TAUGHT THEM ABOUT, YOU KNOW, WHAT THEY SHOULD DO WHEN THEY GET TOGETHER WITH A GIRL. THE THING I TAUGHT THEM WAS, ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL IF SOMEBODY WILL FUCK YOU. YOU ALWAYS SAY, "THANK YOU VERY MUCH." AND THE NEXT DAY YOU SAY HELLO. AND, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT JUST "WHAM BAM THANK YOU." YOU HAVE TO BE NICE AND RESPECT THE PERSON THAT'S GIVING YOU THIS GIFT. MY DAD WAS SO FRANK AND SO UPFRONT WITH ME. I THINK I WAS 14 WHEN HE CAME TO ME AND HE SAID, "WHEN YOU'RE READY TO DO IT, JUST LET ME KNOW AND I'LL PRESCRIBE YOU THE PILL." AND IT WAS SO DISGUSTING TO ME THAT I WAS LIKE, "I'M NEVER DOING IT." BUT IN A WAY I THINK HE WAS RIGHT TO DO THAT BECAUSE IT MAKES IT SUCH LESS OF A TABOO. RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA WE ARE A BUNCH OF WEIRDOES. OUR CULTURE IS GOING TO PIECES AND NO ONE IS SAYING, "WELL, IT'S ALL BECAUSE WE'RE AWFUL FUCKERS." AND THE MORE AWFUL FUCKERS WE BECOME, THE MORE PORNOGRAPHIC, THE MORE PROMISCUOUS AND THE MORE PRURIENT AND X-RATED WE BECOME. CULTURES THAT ARE ALL FUCKED UP ABOUT SEX, ABOUT FUCKING, ARE THE CULTURES THAT WILL DECLINE. AND IN THE PROCESS OF THE DECLINE THEY WILL CAUSE WARS. THIS IS THE PICTURE THAT I WANTED YOU TO SEE. THIS PICTURE CHANGED MY LIFE. I MEAN, IT'S NOT ONLY A WOMAN WHO CAN'T HELP HERSELF-- WHO CAN HELP HERSELF FROM BEING JEWISH, WHO CAN'T HELP HERSELF FROM HAVING A BABY, WHO CAN'T HELP HERSELF FROM CLUTCHING HER BABY TO HER CHEST AND KNOWING THAT THIS GUY'S GONNA SHOOT HER AND HER BABY. THIS MAN SHOT THIS WOMAN AND HER CHILD AT A TIME WHEN I WAS AT THE TOP OF MY POWERS, I WAS AS STRONG AS AN OX. MY POWERS AS A JEW, MY POWERS AS A LIFEGUARD MY POWERS AS A SCHOLAR-- I WAS ABSOLUTELY INVINCIBLE THEN. AND I DID THINGS THAT I WAS VERY PROUD OF. BUT I DIDN'T DO ONE GODDAMN THING TO HELP THIS WOMAN. DOC FEELS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BEING A JEW VERY VERY DEEPLY. WE NEVER WENT A FRIDAY WITHOUT LIGHTING OUR CANDLES. WE WOULD DO OUR PRAYERS AND WE WOULD SING THE SHEMA. WE WOULD BE IN ONE BIG ROUND CIRCLE AND WE WOULD ALL HOLD HANDS. I ALMOST FEEL LIKE WE HAD A WHOLE DIFFERENT BRAND OF JUDAISM. WE HAD, LIKE, A HOLOCAUST UPBRINGING, LIKE A SURVIVOR'S CHILDREN WOULD HAVE. I THINK HE WANTS TO KIND OF FEEL A BIT OF THAT MISERY AND NEVER EVER FORGET IT. Salvador: EVERYTHING THAT WE DID GROWING UP WAS THE HARD WAY-- EVERYTHING. HE ALWAYS FELT THAT IF IT WAS EASY THEN SOMETHING WAS WRONG. Moses: HE USED TO PLAY FOR US "CHAIRMAN MAO'S WAKE-UP SONG TO THE NATION." EVERY SINGLE MORNING, THAT LITTLE TEENY 45 DISK-- ( imitates Chinese singing ) "ALL RIGHT, EVERYONE, AND..." YOU KNOW, HE WANTED THAT SO BADLY. TO OTHER PEOPLE IT LOOKED LIKE A VERY PERMISSIVE-- HERE THEY ARE, ALL JAMMED IN THIS MOTOR HOME. AND IT LOOKED ONE WAY, BUT IT WAS REALLY A TIGHT SHIP. HE WAS A VERY STRICT, LOVING DAD. ( Chinese anthem playing ) Salvador: WE HAD TO PUT ON A GOOD SHOW FOR EVERYBODY. WHENEVER WE DID AN INTERVIEW FOR SOMEBODY, WE'D HAVE TO STAND IN LINE, FACING A CERTAIN WAY, YOU KNOW, EAT HEALTHY, LIVE CLEAN, SURF CLEAN. Jonathan: PHYSICALLY, DORIAN HAD US ON SUCH A TIGHT DIET. I MEAN, IT WAS LIKE, YOU'RE SURFING EVERY DAY AND TRAVELING UP AND DOWN THE COAST AND YOUR DAD'S PUSHING YOU. AND YOU JUST LITERALLY BUCKLE DOWN AND FOLD YOURSELF IN HALF OR DO WHATEVER IT TAKES, JUST THE PHYSICAL-- TO END THAT ROUTINE. LIKE, THE AMOUNT OF TIMES I'VE FALLEN OFF THE TOP OF OUR CAR WITH NO ONE AROUND IN TOTAL SILENCE, YOU KNOW, MAYBE BLEEDING A LITTLE FROM MY HEAD-- AND I HAD TO LIE THERE, SUCK IT UP AND SNEAK BACK INTO THE CAMPER AND NOT MAKE A PEEP ABOUT IT. AND EVERY ONE OF MY OTHER BROTHERS I KNOW SUFFERED PERSONAL PAIN RELIGIOUSLY. Moses: I HAD A MAJOR SURFING ACCIDENT THAT ALMOST COST MY LIFE. Joshua: THEY WERE SURFING IN NORTHERN MEXICO AND MOSES WAS ON A SURFBOARD THAT HAD BEEN BROKEN IN HALF. HE WAS SURFING ON IT AND IT FLIPPED. I FELL ON THE BOARD AND IT JUST WENT-- SLURP. A SURFBOARD FIN WENT 8.5 INCHES UP MY BUTT... ( groans ) ...CUT MY COLON IN HALF. BLECH-- LITTLE GUTS AND WHATEVER CAME OUT OF ME. DORIAN TOOK THE CAMPER AND EVERYTHING IN IT, AND THREW ALL THE TENTS-- "GO GO GO!" "PUT HIM TOGETHER! PUT HIM TOGETHER!" ( imitates gunfire ) Moses: WE'RE 181 KILOMETERS INTO MEXICO. I WAS DYING. YOU KNOW, I HAD 105? TEMPERATURE. I'VE BEEN INTERNAL BLEEDING FOR 90 MINUTES. BASICALLY, IT TOOK ME OUT OF MOBILITY FOR A YEAR. AND I SWORE I'D NEVER SURF AGAIN, EVER. AND THEN WHEN I SHAT FOR THE FIRST TIME NINE MONTHS LATER, WE HAD A BIG PARTY. I SHAT IN FRONT OF, LIKE, 50 PEOPLE AT SAN ONOFRE. THIS IS MY LITTLE PLACE WHERE I WORK. "COSMOS" BY CARL SAGAN THAT TAUGHT ME PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING THAT THERE WAS TO LEARN ABOUT THE WORLD AND HISTORY. MY DAD BOUGHT ME A LITTLE COMMODORE VIC-20, WHICH WAS ONE OF THE FIRST HOME COMPUTING MACHINES, BUT THE TROUBLE WAS, IT CONNECTED TO THE TV. AND ON THE RARE TIMES THAT WE WOULD PLUG INTO ELECTRICITY ALL THE BROTHERS SAID, "NO FUCKING WAY YOU'RE USING THE TV TO PROGRAM. WE'RE WATCHING TV, YOU KNOW, FOR THE FIRST TIME IN FOUR MONTHS" OR SOMETHING. WHEN YOU HAVE NO SENSE OF BOUNDARIES WITH YOUR BROTHERS AND YOUR SISTER, IT MADE SOME BROTHERS COPE BETTER WITH WHAT THEY HAD TO COPE WITH BY TEASING. IT WAS SO COMPETITIVE-- DAVID, JONATHAN AND ISRAEL ALMOST IN THE SAME DIVISION GROWING UP AND ABSOLUTELY AT EACH OTHER'S THROATS. ALL THEY WANTED TO DO WAS COMPETE. LIKE CRABS IN A BUCKET THAT SEE OTHER BROTHERS' SUCCESS AS THEIR FAILURE, NO MATTER WHAT. Salvador: AND IT WAS JUST A LOT OF PHYSICAL TORTURE AND A LOT OF JUST-- THAT WAS HARD. Moses: NINE CHILDREN LIVING IN A 24-FOOT CAMPER. I THINK THE WORST THING TO ME PERSONALLY WAS SEEING MY MOM GO FROM CAMPER TO CAMPER TO A WORSE AND WORSE LIVING SITUATION. SHE WAS SO BEAT UP FROM HAVING CHILDREN. SHE WAS SO JUST TORN TO PIECES. Moses: WHEN YOU HAVE SO MANY MEMBERS OF YOUR FAMILY LIVING, BREATHING, SHITTING, EATING TOGETHER IN SUCH TIGHT QUARTERS, YOU HAVE THESE FLARE-UPS. THERE ARE SO MANY POSITIVE IONS BETWEEN THESE MALE, YOU KNOW, HORMONES. Salvador: SO I FOUND MY LITTLE NICHE IN THE CAMPER OF JUST KIND OF RUNNING AWAY TO MY DREAM WORLD OF BOOKS AND DRAWINGS AND STUFF. BUT WHAT REALLY PISSED ME OFF IS THAT DAD WAS BEING SEXUALLY SATISFIED DURING MY TEENAGE YEARS AND I WAS VERY SEXUALLY FRUSTRATED. AND WHETHER YOU WANT TO CONSIDER SEX EVEN GOING TO THE PROM, BECAUSE THAT'S KIND OF AN EXTENSION OF SEX, OR A DATE AND KISSING, I DIDN'T GET ANY! I GUESS SEX WAS THE THING THAT SAID TO EACH ONE OF US, "WOW, WE'D BETTER FIND A RECEPTACLE FOR THIS URGE." AND THEY CERTAINLY WEREN'T AT PESCADERO, 1500 MILES AWAY FROM THE NEAREST, YOU KNOW, FAST-FOOD JOINT. TV narrator: THINGS ARE CHANGING FOR THE PASKOWITZES. FOUR OF THE BOYS ARE NOW GOOD ENOUGH TO TAKE ON THE BEST IN THE SURFING WORLD. THEY'VE TURNED PROFESSIONAL AND ARE GETTING OFFERS AND SPONSORSHIPS FROM THE MANUFACTURERS OF SURFBOARDS, WETSUITS AND THE LIKE. BUT HOW LONG CAN DORIAN PASKOWITZ KEEP HIS LITTLE BAND OF NONCONFORMISTS TOGETHER ONCE THEY'VE TASTED MATERIAL COMFORTS? David: ONCE YOU GET A WHIFF OF THE GOOD LIFE PER SE, ONCE YOU GO OVER TO YOUR FRIEND'S HOUSE AND YOU SEE THAT THEY HAVE DONUTS FOR BREAKFAST, IT'S HARD TO JUST SAY NO. IT'S HARD TO, LIKE, GO BACK TO THE CAMPER AND EAT SEVEN-GRAIN CEREAL. WE WOULD CONFRONT HIM ON A DAILY BASIS. WE'D SAY, "THIS IS FUCKED. I WANT TO GO TO HIGH SCHOOL," YOU KNOW. BUT HE WAS JUST UNYIELDING FOR AS LONG AS HE POSSIBLY COULD. David: I ADORE THIS PICTURE. I MEAN, LOOK AT THAT. WE'RE ALL TOGETHER IN THE WATER LIKE A FAMILY, EVEN MY MOM. BUT I MUST SAY THAT JONATHAN AND SALVADOR ARE ACTUALLY BLEEDING FROM BEING COERCED OUT INTO THE WATER. Man: YOU MEAN, LIKE FROM STANDING ON CORAL OR SOMETHING? NO, FROM BEING BEATEN. HE IS A DICTATOR. YEAH, HE WAS FIDEL. HIS METHOD OF PUNISHMENT SOMETIMES I FELT WAS EXTREME. HE WAS SO ADAMANT, SO CONTROLLING. IT ABSOLUTELY KILLED HIM WHEN HE LOST THOSE CONTROLS. Juliette: HE WAS YOUNG AND FULL OF LIFE AND HE HAD A HEAVY TEMPER. HE ONE TIME BROKE ALL THE FURNITURE IN A FIT OF ANGER. I USED TO CRY A LOT WHEN WE WERE YOUNG. I LOVED SUPPORTING THE REICH. DAD SAID, "LET'S DO THIS," AND I WAS ON IT. AND THE TROOPS FELL IN LINE, OR ELSE I WOULD HAVE COME AND SLAYED THE REBELLION. STAND IN LINE, DO THE CALISTHENICS, MAKE SURE YOU'RE ZIPPED UP RIGHT. "I DON'T WANT TO WEAR THIS WETSUIT." "YOU'LL WEAR THIS WETSUIT OR I'LL--" YOU KNOW. THAT WAS-- POOR DAVID. HE THOUGHT THAT HE WAS DOING RIGHT BY EXPRESSING DORIAN'S WILL AT ALL TIMES, AND MEANWHILE EVERYONE JUST KIND OF WANTED TO-- "OH, DAD'S GONE. LET'S RAISE SOME HELL AND DO SOMETHING BAD." David: I WASN'T REALLY FIGHTING FOR DORIAN. I WAS FIGHTING FOR THE CONCEPT THAT HE LOCKED INTO. ONCE HE GOT THIS THING UP AND RUNNING, IT WAS SO BITCHIN' I DIDN'T WANT IT TO EVER GO AWAY. I WANTED TO ALMOST SAY, "LET'S NOT BLOW THIS. THIS IS A GREAT THING." Juliette: SEE, DAVID WAS THE CAPTAIN, BUT HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY CO-CAPTAINS OR LIEUTENANTS. AND DORIAN ADDED TO THAT INTENSITY BY MAKING HIM UNDERSTAND THAT EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED WITH THE BROTHERS WAS HIS RESPONSIBILITY. David: JONATHAN THREW MUD, I THINK, IN THE BATHROOMS OR HE LIT OUR PORTA POTTY ON FIRE OR HE DID SOMETHING REALLY BAD. AND HERE I WAS-- ( clicks finger ) "SIC HIM"-- CHASING JONATHAN DOWN THE BEACH... DORIAN FOLLOWING ME-- "GET HIM! YOU CAN GET HIM!" I THREW HIM TO THE GROUND AND MY DAD STOOD OVER ME AND SAID, "CHOKE HIM." SO I GRABBED JONATHAN BY THE THROAT AND I CHOKED HIM UNTIL HIS NOSE BEGAN TO BLEED. AND I REALIZED, "HOLY SHIT, I REALLY AM LISTENING TO THIS." YOU KNOW, "WHAT'S NEXT?" I FEEL HORRIBLY GUILTY FOR PLAYING THAT ROLE. AND I THINK WE WOULD BE A FAMILY RIGHT NOW IF THERE WASN'T SUCH A MILITANT HAND ON THE WHOLE THING. TV narrator: JONATHAN, 18, HAS REBELLED AND LEFT THE FAMILY TO LIVE A MORE CONVENTIONAL LIFE. I'M MORE LIKE THE AVERAGE PERSON NOW. I'M MORE LIKE THE AVERAGE 19-YEAR-OLD CALIFORNIA MALE. UH... MY BROTHERS, ON THE OTHER HAND, ARE MORE LIKE BRAINWASHED, IN-GOOD-SHAPE- BUT-NOT-TOTALLY-EDUCATED CALIFORNIA MALE. David: I LEFT HOME AT 23. HE WENT BALLISTIC. "HOW DARE YOU DO THIS TO YOUR MOTHER AND I? WE CAN'T DO THIS WITHOUT YOU. WE'RE GONNA ALL DIE OUT THERE." AND I'M LIKE, "DAD, I'M 23 YEARS OLD." ( chuckles ) Sonia: DAVID CAME HERE AND ADAM CAME HERE. AND THEY WANTED TO SING. AND THEY WANTED A JOB. SO WE WENT OUT TO SECONDHAND PLACES. I GOT THEM DRESSED. ALL THRIFT-STORE CLOTHES THAT SHE WENT AND BOUGHT ME-- BECAUSE I HAD BATHING SUITS AND T-SHIRTS. AND I WAS A JOHNNY MATHIS IMPERSONATOR. THAT WAS MY FIRST GIG. AND I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT WE WERE DOING ALL OF THESE GAY BARS. THE PHOTOGRAPHER CAME UP WITH THIS POSE. I WAS REALLY COOL. I WAS HANGING OUT. I WAS 21. I WAS MAKING $300-$400 A NIGHT IN TIPS. I SAVED MONEY. I BOUGHT A CAR. THEY CALLED ME "G.Q. ABE." I WORE MY POLO COLOGNE AND MY CARRERA SUNGLASSES. EVERYBODY RAN OUT AND TRIED TO GET OUT OF THE FAMILY, TRIED TO CREATE A LIFE IN SOCIETY AND JUST WENT THEIR OWN SEPARATE WAYS. David: WE HAD CREATED NINE ONLY CHILDREN. WE ALL WANTED TO BE KNOWN. Jonathan: WHEN I WAS DOING THIS COMPANY "BLACK FLYS" WE GOT VERY POPULAR VERY QUICKLY AND I PROMOTED A LOT OF BANDS. AND ADAM FORMED A BAND AND THEN HE DID THIS RECORD DEAL. AND JOSH CAME IN AND DID THIS SCAT ON IT AND BAM-- IT WENT OFF. THEY BLEW UP. ? ...I WANT YOU ? ? SUFFER SUFFER, YOU DON'T GET NO ROUGHER ? ? RUB IT UP, BABY GIRL, DON'T YOU BE LIKE NO OTHER ? ? SUFFER SUFFER, YOU DON'T GET NO ROUGHER... ? Navah: MOST OF MY BROTHERS WENT THROUGH A PERIOD WHERE THEY JUST WENT CRAZY. EVERYONE WAS A SUPERSTAR. EVERYBODY WAS THE NEXT SURF CHAMPION. EVERYONE WAS THE NEXT MODEL. ? ...SUFFER SUFFER, YOU DON'T GET NO ROUGHER ? ? WHEN YOU ROCK ME, BABY, PUT YOUR THING ON ME, LOVER... ? JONATHAN, GIVE US THE PASKOWITZ FAMILY UPDATE. WELL, DAVID IS A MUSICIAN. HE'S GOT A COUPLE OF BANDS-- "GOLDFISH" AND "JOHNNY MONSTER AND THE NIGHTMARES." I'M WORKING ON PROJECTS WITH ISRAEL AND ABRAHAM. ABRAHAM IS PRIMARILY OUR SALESMAN. MOSES WORKS ON THE SONY LOT FOR "PARTY OF FIVE." ADAM AND JOSHUA ARE IN THE TOP 40 RIGHT NOW, JUST OPENED FOR "THE ROLLING STONES." AND NAVAH JUST GOT MARRIED AND THEY'RE PREGNANT WITH THEIR FIRST SON. AND SALVADOR, THE GRAPHIC GENIUS OF THE FAMILY-- HE'S BEEN DOING ALL THE GRAPHICS AND COMPUTER WORK - FOR THE HURLEY COMPANY. - Host: I'LL TELL YOU, YOU ASK FOR THE FAMILY UPDATE, AND IT'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE WITH ALL OF THEM. I WAS AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE. ? ...WANT YOU ? ? DON'T YOU BE LIKE NO OTHER ? ? GOT YOU WHERE I WANT YOU ? ? GOT YOU WHERE I WANT YOU. ? Dorian: I HAVE NEVER SUFFERED IN ANY TIME IN MY LIFE FROM FAILURE, BUT I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN VERY WARY OF SUCCESS. THIS IS ISAIAH, AND HE'S TELLING ME ABOUT HIS FIRST WEEK AT SCHOOL. TELL ME ABOUT YOUR FIRST WEEK AT SCHOOL COME ON, USE YOUR LANGUAGE. TELL ME ABOUT THE FIRST WEEK AT SCHOOL. - WAS IT FUN? - YES. WHAT DID YOU DO AT SCHOOL? - WHAT DID YOU DO? - ( screams ) WHAT DID YOU DO? WHAT DID YOU LEARN? WHAT DID YOU LEARN? - READING. - READING? WHAT ELSE? WHAT ELSE? - ( whispers ) WHAT ELSE DID YOU DO? - SOCIAL SCIENCE. - SOCIAL SCIENCE? - AND TAKE A BREAK. AND THEN YOU TAKE A BREAK. AND WHAT ELSE DID YOU DO? ( mumbles ) OH NO. WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT. HE'S 14 NOW. WE'VE BEEN THROUGH A LOT. NOBODY CAN EVEN IMAGINE. NOBODY IN HIS FAMILY HAS BEEN AROUND ISAIAH THAT MUCH. AND ISRAEL-- HE LITERALLY RAN AWAY FROM IT. ( engine starts ) Izzy: AFTER I GOT OUT OF THE CAMPER, MY WHOLE LIFE WAS LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE. I MARRIED THE MOST BEAUTIFUL GIRL IN TOWN AND I HAD A SUCCESSFUL PROFESSIONAL SURFING CAREER AND ENDORSEMENTS BY NIKE AND HANG TEN AND ALL THESE GREAT COMPANIES. AND I FELT TOTALLY ROBBED, THAT IF THERE WAS A GOD OUT THERE, HE WAS A BAD GOD FOR GIVING ME ISAIAH. THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS IS JUST THE ENDLESS PARTY, SO I DEFINITELY DRANK TOO MUCH. AT SOME POINT OR ANOTHER IN TIME, ABE, EVERYBODY'S PRETTY MUCH THROWN THEIR HAND IN IN THIS THING, RIGHT, BACK FROM THE BEGINNING? YEAH, WELL, DORIAN STARTED THE CAMP AND THEN THE EVOLUTION BEGAN WITH DAVID, AND THEN I TOOK IT OVER AND THEN MOSES HAD IT FOR A WHILE. AND NOW IZZY IS RUNNING THE CAMP AND I THINK HE'S DOING A GREAT JOB WITH IT. - Izzy: AW, SHUCKS, ABE. - Host: AW. Jonathan: ISRAEL IS AN EX-PRO SURFER WITH NO SCHOOL, NO SKILLS, MARRIED WITH KIDS, AND NOW AN AUTISTIC CHILD. DAD SAID, "LOOK, IZZY NEEDS OUR HELP." IF ANY BROTHER NEEDED THE SURF CAMP AS AN OCCUPATION, ISRAEL NEEDED IT. Dorian: ISRAEL WAS THE ONLY BOY WHO WOULD TRULY RISK HIS LIFE, HIS FORTUNES, HIS COMFORT, EVERYTHING IN THE INTERESTS OF SURFING. AND I FELT ISRAEL DESERVED TO OWN THE CAMP. Joshua: AT THE SURF CAMP THIS YEAR IT'S PRETTY MUCH JUST BEEN ABRAHAM, ISRAEL AND I. AND THAT'S BEEN COOL, YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW, WE REALLY WOULD LIKE TO HAVE MORE OF THE BROTHERS COME DOWN, BUT, I MEAN, HONESTLY, SOME OF THEM CAN'T EVEN HANDLE IT. YOU KNOW, THEY'D HAVE CORONARIES, BECAUSE IT'S HARD. AND THEN OTHER ONES ARE TOO BUSY. AND, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY, THERE ARE CERTAIN BROTHERS WE DON'T EVEN WANT TO BE HERE, YOU KNOW. - Man: WHAT DO YOU MEAN? - WELL, LIKE DAVID. Nancy Paskowitz: WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN ESTRANGED FROM THE FAMILY FOR ALMOST SIX YEARS. WE'VE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THE SURF CAMP DUE TO FINANCIAL REASONS. David: I CAME BACK FROM NEW YORK AND WENT BACK TO THE SURF CAMP TO WORK FOR THE SUMMER. AND I FIND OUT THAT MY FAMILY LOST THE CONCESSION AT SAN ONOFRE, WHICH MEANS THAT THE STATE NO LONGER GIVES YOU THE RIGHT TO DO BUSINESS ON PUBLIC PROPERTY. SO I ASKED THEM ABOUT IT AND THEY SAID, "WELL, WE'VE GOT LAWYERS INVOLVED. DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT. WE DON'T NEED YOUR HELP." BUT WHEN ABRAHAM STARTED TALKING ABOUT FIREBOMBING THE RANGER STATION, I KNEW THEY NEEDED HELP. SO I WENT WITH MY FRIEND DAVE TO THE HEAD OF THE PARK AT THE TIME. HE SAID, "WELL, WE HAVE SEVEN INFRACTIONS THAT HAVE ACCUMULATED TO A DISMISSAL." WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO INCLUDE DAVE AS A BUSINESS PARTNER BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT HAVE THE PASKOWITZ FAMILY BACK THERE WITHOUT SOME SORT OF ADULT SUPERVISION. WE CAME BACK TO HIM WITH A BUSINESS PLAN, WITH A MARKETING PLAN, WITH AN EMPLOYEE DOCTRINE, WITH A FINANCIAL BREAKDOWN, WITH A SPONSORSHIP PACKAGE INTACT, WITH EVERYTHING HE WANTED TO SEE. AND WE COULD HIRE THE FAMILY BACK UNDER OUR AUSPICES. SO I SAID, "GUYS, I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A BIG SURPRISE. I WANT YOU TO COME DOWN AND VISIT ME. WE'RE GONNA HAVE A MEETING." I THOUGHT I WAS GONNA BE THE CONQUERING HERO. WE ALL MET HIM AT THIS OFFICE AND WE ALL WENT TO THE BOARDROOM. ( chuckles ) OH, THE BOARDROOM-- THE BOARDROOM WAS AMAZING. - IT WAS A DISASTER. - PORTFOLIOS OUT IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY, AND A LITTLE PEN FOR EVERYONE. EVERYONE'S LIKE, "DUDE, WE'RE JUST SURFERS. WHAT ARE YOU DOING, BRO?" "GUYS, DAVE AND I HAVE GOTTEN THE CONCESSION BACK." DAVID SAYS, "THIS IS MY PARTNER, DAVID RON SOMETHING. HE'S GONNA BE THE ONE THAT'S GONNA MAKE US ALL RICH." David: THEY STARTED CRYING AND SCREAMING. AND JONATHAN ALMOST GOT IN A FISTFIGHT - WITH THE LAWYER. - JOSHUA BROKE DOWN AND CRIED. ABRAHAM'S TAKING PICTURES OF, LIKE, ALL THE LICENSE PLATES. - ISRAEL SAID, "I WANT TO FIGHT YOU." - "IF WE EVER SEE THESE LICENSE PLATES AGAIN, WE'RE GONNA STOP AND SAY HELLO." AND HE ATTACKED, RELENTLESS. AND THEN MOSES ACTUALLY PICKED UP THE PHONE, DIALED 911. AND THAT WAS IT. Moses: THE PASKOWITZ FAMILY NEVER MADE ANY MONEY, YOU KNOW. AND THE ONLY MONEY THAT EVER WAS MADE WAS AT SURF CAMP. SO EVERYONE'S LIKE, "OH MY GOD, I WANNA DO THE CAMP. I WANNA DO THE CAMP," THIS AND THAT. IT'S LIKE GOLD FEVER. IT FREAKS YOU OUT. AND SO WHEN SOMEONE SAID, "WAIT A MINUTE, DAVID WANTS TO TAKE AWAY OUR GOLD"-- NO WAY. EVERYBODY THOUGHT THAT, LIKE FOR INSTANCE THE CAMP WAS AN ARGUMENT OVER MONEY. AND IT'S NOT AN ARGUMENT OVER MONEY. IT'S AN ARGUMENT OVER THE ABILITY TO DO THE THINGS THAT YOU WANT TO DO TO SURVIVE AND HAVE A WONDERFUL LIFE. SO DOES IT ALL DEPEND ON MONEY? HELL, YEAH. IT DEPENDS ON MONEY. BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY, YOU CAN'T BUY THE BREAD, YOU CAN'T BUY THE BAGEL, YOU CAN'T GUY THE BACON. IF YOU DON'T HAVE MONEY, YOU DON'T HAVE A LIFESTYLE. YOU HAVE A CONSTANT WORRY ABOUT MONEY. AND IN SOME WAYS DAD LIVED POORLY FINANCIALLY AND RICHLY EMOTIONALLY, BUT ALL OF US SUFFERED WORRYING ABOUT NOT HAVING MONEY. ? I'D WALK ? ? BUT MY FEET HURT ME ? ? I'D RUN ? ? BUT I'M GOING NOWHERE ? ? I LOST MYSELF ? ? IN ANGER, BUT... ? ? I DON'T KNOW... ? ( continues singing indistinctly ) ( audience cheering ) ( audience applauding ) Adam: THIS IS MY 500th GIG PROBABLY, MAYBE MORE. AND THEY NEVER GET ANY DIFFERENT. YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS END UP IN A ROOM WITH A BUNCH OF STICKERS ON IT. YOU KNOW, I-- SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD HAVE JUST BEEN A DOCTOR LIKE MY DAD. OF COURSE, NEVER GOING TO SCHOOL MAY HAVE BEEN A PROBLEM. Abraham: I'M AT THE BEACH FIRE BAR AND GRILL-- NICE GRINDS, GOOD PEOPLE, GOOD FOOD, GOOD TIMES. AND THEY WERE NICE ENOUGH TO GIVE ME A JOB, BASICALLY. I LOVE TO COOK. I WAS THE FIRST GIRL BEFORE NAVAH. I WAS THE ONLY ONE IN MY FAMILY THAT EVER HELPED MY MOM, OUT OF ALL THE MEGALOMANIAC BROTHERS. BUT WHAT REALLY HURT ME IS THE FACT THAT I WAS SO INTO MEDICINE AND I WANTED SO BAD TO GO TO MEDICAL SCHOOL. I WANTED TO GO TO STANFORD. AND WHEN I WAS 18 I STILL HAD HOPES THAT I COULD DO THAT. SO I STARTED TAKING CLASSES-- YOU KNOW, THE G.E.D, ALL THIS STUFF, JUNIOR COLLEGE. AND I HAD E.M.T. COURSES AND FIRST AID, LIFESAVING. AND THEN I TALKED TO SOME COUNSELORS AND THEY SAID THAT IT WOULD BE LITERALLY 10 YEARS TO CATCH UP. BY THE TIME I QUALIFIED TO GO TO A GOOD FOUR-YEAR COLLEGE, I'D BE 30 YEARS OLD. IT BROUGHT ME TO TEARS WHEN I KNEW THAT I WAS SO FAR BEHIND. AND THAT DREAM-- POOH-- WAS GONE. FROM THAT DAY I SAID, "I'LL NEVER BE A DOCTOR." Navah: YOU KNOW, MY DAD ALWAYS LOVES TO SHOW OFF THE FACT THAT HE'S A STANFORD GRADUATE. AND IT'S LIKE, WHAT THE HECK KIND OF STANFORD GRADUATE, WHAT THE HECK KIND OF JEW WOULD SAY, "I'M NOT SENDING MY KIDS TO SCHOOL"? I THINK THAT WAS COMPLETELY UNFAIR. IF YOU WERE GONNA KEEP US IN THE CAMPER FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES, THEN THAT WAS OKAY. BUT YOU CAN'T KEEP US UNEDUCATED AND THEN SEND US OFF INTO THE WORLD AND EXPECT THAT THERE'S NOT GONNA BE SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS, YOU KNOW? Salvador: MY DAD ALWAYS-- HE ALWAYS WANTED US TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE WERE NO DIFFERENT FROM THE GREAT APES, WHICH WAS FINE IF WE HAD STAYED THERE. BUT WE DIDN'T STAY THERE. WE GOT MARRIED, YOU KNOW, AND OUR WIVES DIDN'T WANT TO BE MARRIED TO AN ANIMAL. ( both laugh ) SO, YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO DEAL WITH MODERN LIFE SOMETIMES, STILL. - Sawin: NEXT WEEK? - SAME TIME NEXT WEEK? YOU GOT IT. BYE. Phaedra Paskowitz: IT'S A STRUGGLE FOR ALL OF THE PASKOWITZ BROTHERS AND A SISTER TO FUNCTION IN A SOCIETY THAT THEY WEREN'T REALLY PREPARED FOR. THEY WERE GIVEN THIS IDEA THAT YOU COULD LIVE LIFE THE WAY YOU WANTED TO, YOU COULD LIVE WHERE YOU COULD BREATHE, WHEN ALL OF THAT IS ALL WONDERFUL, BUT THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER ELEMENTS, I THINK, THAT AFFECT DAILY LIVING. Jonathan: THE INABILITY TO HOLD DOWN A JOB LIKE A NORMAL PERSON WOULD, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE JUST IN THE LAST 10 YEARS I'D CREATED A $20-MILLION COMPANY FOR ONE GUY AND RAN A SPORTSWEAR COMPANY AND, YOU KNOW, THINGS LIKE THAT, WHERE I SHOULD HAVE BEEN SMARTER. I SHOULD HAVE HAD A CONTRACT WITH THESE GUYS. I SHOULD HAVE GOT A PIECE OF THE PIE OR WHATEVER IT IS. AND BECAUSE I'M A PASKOWITZ, I'M NOT SMART ENOUGH IN "THE WAYS OF THE WICKED," AS DORIAN WOULD SAY, THE SOCIETY'S WAYS. Phaedra: AND SO NOW AS ADULTS, TO HAVE A FAMILY, TO HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT, TO OWN A HOME, TO MAKE PAYMENTS, AND TO CONSISTENTLY DO THAT IS A STRUGGLE. Jonathan: FOR ANYBODY THAT THINKS, "WELL, THOSE GUYS, THE PASKOWITZES-- THEY HAD A WONDERFUL HOLISTIC EXPERIENCE IN THEIR LIVES AND THEY SHOULD HAVE KEPT IT CLEAN AND BURNED PURE LIKE A CANDLE GOD MADE WITH HIS OWN URINE"-- FIRST OF ALL, I COULDN'T GIVE A SHIT WHAT PEOPLE THINK. FOR SURE, SOCIALLY WE HAVE ALL CREATED VICES FOR OURSELVES. UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE HUMAN. Joshua: I HAVE PLAYED EVERY PIT, EVERY DUMP, EVERY PLACE OF MALCONTENT FROM HERE TO FREAKIN' CZECHOSLOVAKIA. THIS IS A NEW DUMP. OH, I'M SORRY. CAN WE NOT SIT HERE? NOT GOOD? NO? ? HARDER THAN A RAIL ? ? SHARPER THAN A NAIL ? ? THAT THEY PIERCE THE BELLY OF THE SIDE ? ? OF THE FAVORITE MOTHER'S SON... ? THEY'RE LAZY. NOT 1/10 OF THE PEOPLE-- THE CHILDREN OF THE EARTH HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT MY KIDS HAVE. ? ...INSIDE THE FIST ? ? OF EVERY BABY BORN ? ? INSIDE THE FURY ? ? OF EVERY WOMAN SCORNED... ? ONE OF MY SAD DISAPPOINTMENTS IS THAT MY KIDS DIDN'T FIND OUT FOR THEMSELVES THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN EDUCATION AND KNOWLEDGE. Dorian: LISTEN, A LOT OF PEOPLE GO TO SCHOOL. A LOT OF PEOPLE GO TO STANFORD. A LOT OF PEOPLE GO TO MIDDLE SCHOOL AND HIGH SCHOOL AND COLLEGE. WHY AREN'T YOU OUT-- WHY AREN'T YOU OUT FILMING THEM? HOW COME YOU COME TO A BUNCH OF IGNORAMUSES, A MEXICAN INDIAN AND A DUMB JEW? HOW COME YOU'RE FILMING US? - ( song intro playing ) - David: I WROTE A SONG FOR MY FATHER THAT EXPRESSED MY-- MY DISAPPOINTMENT WITH THE WAY HE TREATED ME. AND I FELT THAT I'D PUT IN MY GOOD TIME TO BE TRUSTED AND BELIEVED IN. AND SO BASICALLY THIS SONG SAID THAT THINGS WON'T GET BETTER UNTIL HE'S GONE. BECAUSE HIS WILL IS TOO STRONG TO LET ANYONE ELSE'S COME OUT. ? Feel you... ? FEEL YOU... - ? Frail eyes... ? - FRAIL EYES... - ? Think you... ? - THINK YOU... - ? But broken mind... ? - BUT BROKEN MIND... - STOP NOW... - ? Stop now... ? - AND REALIZE... - ? And realize... ? - TO WHOM YOU... - ? To whom you... ? ? ...GAVE THE PRIZE ? ? SEE NOW ? ? CRY YOU MUST ? ? SOON I'LL LEAVE ? ? YOU, DUST ? ? DO YOU STILL ? ? PRAY TOO? ? ? TO YOUR FACE ? ? I SAY ? ? YOU MUST ? ? GO DOWN ? ? YOU GO ? ? DOWN ? ? YOU MUST ? ? GO DOWN ? ? YOU GO ? ? DOWN ? ? I TRIED THE GOOD, BUT THE GOOD SAID NO ? ? LOOK TO ANOTHER ANSWER ? ? GIVE ME ONE MORE CHANCE SO I'LL KNOW ? ? WHO-- ? ? LOOK INTO MY EYES, TELL ME WHAT YOU SEE ? ? ANOTHER SOUL IN DISASTER ? ? DEVIL TAKES ANOTHER LITTLE PART OF ME ? ? GOD, YOU ARE A NO-RISK MASTER... ? ( mock laugh ) - ( music stops ) - I CAN'T HEAR ANY MORE OF THAT. - ISN'T THAT HORRIBLE? - Man: DID HE EVER HEAR THAT? Juliette: WE HAVEN'T JOINED THE CIRCLE IN OVER 10 YEARS. AND I DOUBT IF IT WILL HAPPEN SOON. DORIAN IS A HIGHLY FEELING INSTRUMENT-- HIGHLY, VERY SENSITIVE, VERY INTELLIGENT. HE'S-- HE'S LIKE A PROPHET. HE FEELS THESE THINGS DIFFERENTLY FROM OTHER PEOPLE. I GUESS THAT'S WHY HE'S SO EXTREME, YOU KNOW-- MARRYING A CERTAIN KIND OF A WIFE, HAVING A GREAT NUMBER OF CHILDREN, INTRODUCING SURFING TO ISRAEL AND SO ON AND SO ON. BUT HE'S LIKE A RECEPTACLE FOR THE INSPIRING TERRIBLE THINGS OF LIVING. Dorian: IN MANY TIMES IN MY LIFE WITH MY KIDS I WAS FAR TOO SERIOUS, FAR TOO RADICAL AND FAR TOO TIGHTFISTED. BUT THAT'S JUST A WAY OF SAYING I WASN'T THE MAN THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN. 'CAUSE A REAL MAN, LIKE A REAL WOMAN, IS CAPABLE OF CONTROLLING HIMSELF BEFORE HE CONTROLS HIS CHILDREN. DID I GIVE THEM THE ACTUAL TOOLS THAT IN A WAY INVENT OPPORTUNITY? NO, I DID NOT. Salvador: IF YOU LOOK AT MY FATHER, AND INSERT HIM IN ANY TIME IN THE HISTORY OF HUMANITY, HE IS A GREAT HUMAN BEING. IF YOU INSERT HIM IN THIS SMALL TECHNOLOGICAL TIME, HE HASN'T DONE THAT MUCH. HE HAS NO TRAPPINGS OF A COMFORTABLE EXISTENCE. AND 99% OF PEOPLE WOULD WANT TO BE A PART OF THE WORLD THAT ISN'T JUST RELATING TO SURVIVAL. SO, YOU KNOW, YOU CAN SAY HE HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT A FAILURE HIS WHOLE LIFE. Dorian: WE GAVE THEM LOVE, TOGETHERNESS, FOOD, CLOTHING AND SHELTER. WE GAVE THEM DIET, THE EXERCISE THEY HAD ALWAYS, THE REST THAT THEY GOT-- HUDDLED TOGETHER WITH ONE ANOTHER, THEY SLEPT LIKE PUPPIES. THEIR RECREATION WAS ONE ANOTHER, AND THE ANTICIPATION OF A NEW DAY. AND THEIR ATTITUDES OF MIND WERE MAYBE NOT GREAT PHILOSOPHIES, BUT THEY WERE SENSIBLE ATTITUDES. NO NO, HEY, I HAVE TO GO. I HAVE TO GO. ( speaking Hebrew ) - YOU WANT TO DO THIS TOMORROW? - YES. - WILL YOU TAKE CARE OF THIS? - GIVE ME. - YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF IT? - YES YES. - YOU'LL TAKE GOOD CARE OF IT? - YES YES. - YEAH? YOU DON'T HURT YOURSELF? - YES. - NO HURT YOURSELF, OKAY? - OKAY. - DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME? - IT'S GOOD, YOU. - YOU BE SAFE, THOUGH, OKAY? - OKAY. - ALL RIGHT? - ALL RIGHT. - GOOD. - THANK YOU. - YOU'RE WELCOME. - YOU? - FOR YOU. - ( shouts ) - BE CAREFUL. - OKAY, THANK YOU. - BE CAREFUL. - OKAY. Jonathan: WE'LL SEE IF HE IS CAREFUL. Salvador: I READ MY DAD'S BOOK "SURFING IN HEALTH" FOR THE FIRST TIME. HE SAID ONE THING IN THAT BOOK THAT MADE SENSE TO ME, WHICH WAS, THE PRIMITIVE MAN HAD TO FIGHT EVERY DAY NOT TO BE HUNGRY, AND THE MODERN MAN HAS TO FIGHT EVERY DAY TO BE HUNGRY. BECAUSE AS HARD AS IT WAS FOR THE PRIMITIVE MAN TO GET THE FOOD, IT'S SO EASY FOR US TO GET IT AND DIE FROM IT. I GOT THAT. IT MADE SENSE. WHY WOULDN'T IT BE A STRUGGLE? Jonathan: EVERY BONE IN MY BODY WISHES ONE DAY TO GET BACK TO THAT LEVEL OF HEALTH-- NOT BEING THE ABSENCE OF ILLNESS BUT A SUPERIOR STATE OF WELL-BEING ABOVE AND BEYOND SIMPLY BEING, BUT BEING EVERYTHING A HUMAN BEING COULD BE SO THAT THE BRAIN CAN BE EVERYTHING THAT IT CAN BE. David: EVERYONE CAN DO IT. THERE'S ONLY ONE ACHILLES' HEEL TO THE WHOLE THING-- IT'S THAT YOU'VE GOT TO BE HONEST ABOUT REALLY WANTING IT. Navah: YOU HAVE TO REALLY CARE. YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT EVERY SINGLE THING YOU PICK UP HAS TO BE THOUGHT ABOUT. YOU CAN'T JUST EAT SOMETHING WITHOUT THOUGHT, WHICH I THINK 100% OF AMERICANS DO. David: WE TAKE THE STEAK, START THE FREAKIN' HUMMER... I THINK THAT'S THE THING THAT DORIAN WAS REALLY AFRAID OF, IS THAT WE WOULD TURN INTO ANTIHUMANS... David: ...WHERE YOU GIVE AS LEAST AS YOU CAN TO GAIN AS MUCH AS YOU CAN IN THE SHORTEST PERIOD OF TIME. Abraham: I THINK THAT THE END OF MODERN CIVILIZATION IS NEAR. I THINK THAT-- David: --THAT THE CURRENT STATE OF EXISTENCE NEEDS TO COME TO A FINALITY, I WOULD HOPE WITH AS LEAST CONSEQUENCE AS POSSIBLE. BUT WE ALL NEED TO GO HUNGRY FOR A BUNCH OF YEARS. Dorian: BECAUSE THE WORLD IS TOO SMALL IN THE CONTEXT OF THE UNIVERSE. AND WE ARE SO SELF-CONTAINED THAT YOU CAN'T JUMP HERE WITHOUT MAKING A NOISE THERE. IF WE CONTINUE IN OUR QUEST FOR POWER AND COMFORTS AND WE KEEP CONSTANTLY AGREEING TO THAT, WE WILL BE UNREPENTANT, WE WILL BE UNKNOWING, WE WILL BE IGNORANT OF OUR OWN VULNERABILITY. AND ONE OF THESE DAYS SOMEONE'S GONNA THROW THE SWITCH. Juliette: TODAY IS A VERY SPECIAL DAY. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT PAPA, BUT I WAS UP AT 4:04 THINKING ABOUT IT AND ANTICIPATING MEETING MY SONS AT THE AIRPORT. Hey, guys, this is David. I just wanted to call and let you know that everything is 100% go... Hey, Dave, it's Navie. I'm so bummed that we couldn't have flown out tonight... It's Salvador. Um, Thanksgiving-- you know why... David: Hopefully everything goes as wonderfully as we can expect... Dorian: WE DON'T WANT TO BE ON OUR ASSES WHEN OUR CHILDREN ARE COMING. HOW ARE YOU? COME ON, COME ON, MY SONS. HI. HOW ARE YOU? NO NO NO NO NO. TA-DAH! GROUP HUG. GROUP HUG. SALVADOR, YOU'RE GETTING THINNER. Salvador: I AM. I'M TRYING SO HARD. THERE HE IS. DON'T FALL OVER OR ANYTHING, DAD. OH MY-- CAREFUL WITH THE HEAD. CAREFUL. TOMORROW-- MR. TOMORROW. OHH, JOSHUA, JOSHUA. JOSHUA'S FULL OF MUSCLES, ABRAHAM. OH, I KNOW. AND YOU'RE FULL OF FAT, ABRAHAM. Juliette: I'M A LITTLE BIT CAUTIOUS ABOUT MY FEELINGS BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. AND I'M ETERNALLY OPTIMISTIC. I THINK THAT SOMEBODY WOULD GO UP TO THEIR BIG BROTHER AND SAY, "BROTHER, I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU," AND JUST GRAB HIM, HUG HIM. I'M VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. WHATEVER HAPPENS, I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO IT. Nancy: I THINK THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO ON CERTAIN ASPECTS. LIFE'S REALLY SHORT, THOUGH. DAVE'S PARENTS ARE OLDER. YOU KNOW, WHO'S TO SAY WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TOMORROW? WE DON'T WANT TO LOOK BACK AND HAVE ANY REGRETS LIKE, "OH, WE SHOULD HAVE DONE THAT OR WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE SAID." IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU DWELL ON. THAT SUN'S GONNA COME UP AND GO DOWN TOMORROW. AND I'VE TRIED TO INSTILL IN MY BROTHERS THAT, LOOK, I'M FUCKING 41 YEARS OLD NOW, AND IF YOU DON'T FIGURE IT OUT PRETTY SOON, YOU'RE GONNA BE 51 AND 61 AND THEN YOU'RE GONNA SAY, "JESUS CHRIST, WE LET 20 YEARS GO BY." AT LEAST WE LET SEVEN YEARS GO BY. Joshua: I'M JUST GLAD TO BE HERE WITH THESE GUYS, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? I'VE DEALT WITH SO MANY OF MY OWN PERSONAL LOSSES THAT I REALIZE EVEN A FLAWED FAMILY THAT STICKS TOGETHER IS BETTER THAN NO FAMILY AT ALL. I'M GONNA GIVE DAVID A BIG HUG AND A KISS RIGHT WHEN I SEE HIM. HI. Man: HERE'S DELILAH AND DAVIDA. HI. WHAT'S YOUR NAME? ( chuckles ) HI. - YOU LOOK GOOD. - THANK YOU, THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. ( laughs ) LET ME JUST STARE AT YOU FOR A SECOND. I KNEW HIM WHEN HE WAS AN INFANT. AND I THINK I'VE HEARD THEY HAD A SECOND, BUT I WAS UNAWARE THAT THERE WAS A THIRD. Juliette: WE ARE 99% ALL TOGETHER. WE'RE JUST MISSING ONE GUY AND HIS FAMILY, AND THAT WOULD BE IZZY. ( man chanting in Hawaiian ) ( chanting continues in distance ) I JUST FLEW IN, BUT I SHOULDN'T BE HERE. I'VE GOT MY AUTISTIC SON HOME THAT'S VIOLENT AND HITTING AND BITING. AND I SHOULDN'T BE HERE, BUT I AM OUT OF RESPECT FOR A VERY SPECIAL PERSON-- YOU KNOW, MY DAD, WHOM I LOVE AND RESPECT AND DON'T UNDERSTAND. OKAY, HOW DO I LOOK? ( distant cheering ) Izzy: I'M HERE. YOU'VE GOT MY LEI ON. - HI, MOM. - I'M SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU. ( chuckles ) - Izzy: OH, IT'S SO NICE TO SEE YOU. - ( crying ) - YOU'VE GOT YOUR LITTLE FAMILY HERE. - OH, THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. - THIS IS FOR YOU. THIS IS FOR YOU. - THANK YOU SO MUCH. YOU KNOW, WE'LL BE ABLE TO HOLD HANDS, CLOSE THE CIRCLE. - Boy: IZZY! - I MISSED YOU. WE'RE OUTSIDE THE GATES FROM HERE. HUG EACH OTHER FOR GOD'S SAKE. ( cheering, applause ) IMAGINE THIS. IT'S UNBELIEVABLE. ( crying ) Izzy: THE GOOD TIMES OUTWEIGH THE BAD, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN? IT'S ALMOST LIKE A DREAM. WHEN I LIE DOWN I STILL THINK ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THAT ALMOST KILLED US, BUT-- AND I WOULD NEVER EVER DO THIS TO MY KIDS, NOT IN A MILLION YEARS. YOU COULDN'T GIVE ME $10 MILLION. Navah: I UNDERSTAND SO MUCH MORE WHY MY MOM AND DAD MADE THE CHOICES THEY DID. AND I HAVE SUCH A NORMAL VALLEY-JEWISH-MOM LIFE NOW. AND NOBODY WOULD EVER BELIEVE THE EXPERIENCES MY BROTHERS AND I HAD TOGETHER. I WOULDN'T CHANGE THAT FOR ANYTHING IN THE WORLD, YOU KNOW, NEVER NEVER. Salvador: THE ONLY CHANGE THAT I WILL MAKE IS I WILL TRY TO GIVE MY DAUGHTER HALO ENOUGH SAVVY ABOUT THE WORLD - THAT SHE CAN BE A PART OF IT... - BYE. ...IF SHE CHOOSES TO BE. AND IF SHE WANTS TO LIVE THE WAY THAT HER GRANDPA LIVED... - BYE. - ...THAT SHE CAN DO THAT TOO. Adam: INSTEAD OF A CAMPER I'M GONNA GET MYSELF A SLOW-MOVING, A SHRIMP KIND OF BOAT, AND THEN JUST GO AS FAR AS I CAN GO FOR AS LONG AS I CAN GO. AND I INTEND TO PUT MY KIDS THROUGH WHAT MY DAD PUT ME THROUGH. I'M NOT SENDING THEM TO SCHOOL. ( chuckles ) AND I'M GONNA, YOU KNOW, KEEP THE DREAM ALIVE. David: I REALLY REALLY LONG FOR THAT MOMENT WHEN I'M DOWN AT PUNTA CONEJO, THE CAR'S STUCK IN THE SAND, WE HAVE NO MONEY, NOTHING TO EAT, BUT AFTER THE HUNGER GOES AWAY AND I'M PADDLING OUT TO THIS FOUR-FOOT LEFT. NOBODY'S OUT. NOBODY KNOWS WHERE IT IS. AND I'M ALL BY MYSELF AND I AM BLAZING. I'M GOING 100 MILES AN HOUR, AND THAT'S IT, DONE. AT THE END OF THE RIDE I EVAPORATE. I WANT IT BACK. I WANT TO BE THERE AGAIN. ( all cheering ) ( all chattering ) - Woman: WHERE'S MAX? - Man: MAX! - Man #2: JEFF, GET IN HERE. - GET YOUR BUTTS IN HERE. - GET OVER HERE, JEFF. - JEFF, GET IN HERE. Jonathan: AND HE'S UP, TURNING, TRULY EXPLORING. ABRAHAM CHARGING OFF THE BOTTOM. - Adam: THERE'S IZZY. - Jonathan: OH, GOD. ( laughing, applauding ) Jonathan: NO STOPPING HIM. LARGE... OFF THE TOP, FLESH TREMBLING. Adam: I'M GONNA WAIT A LITTLE BIT MORE TILL I SEE SOMETHING THAT RESEMBLES SOMETHING THAT'S RIDEABLE. THE THING IS, IS THAT I'M ACTUALLY BETTER THAN ALL OF 'EM. I HADN'T SURFED FOR A YEAR. Juliette: YAHOO! WHOA. NAVIE'S WITH HER. WHOO! Jonathan: OH, YEAH. HE'S NOT GONNA LET THIS ONE SKIP AWAY FROM HIM. OH, NO. AND DAVID BACKSIDES, CHARGING WITH ABRAHAM. DAVID TRYING TO SCARE HIM. ABRAHAM QUIVERING IN TERROR. AND JOSH RIGHT THERE TO GREET THEM. BROTHERS UNITED IN THE WHITE WATER. Juliette: A BEAUTIFUL RIDE. BRAVO. Juliette: ENJOY YOUR LITTLE CHILDREN WHILE THEY'RE LITTLE. AND JUST LOVE THEM, LOVE THEM, LOVE THEM, BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA GROW VERY FAST. ( kid yells ) Dorian: IT'S EASIER TO DIE WHEN YOU HAVE LIVED THAN IT IS TO DIE WHEN YOU HAVEN'T. SO I SAY TO ALL YOUNG PEOPLE, GO MAKE MEMORIES, BEAUTIFUL MEMORIES. WHEN THE TIME COMES FOR YOU TO GO YOU WILL NOT GO ALONE. ( mid-tempo music playing ) ? AHH-HH... ? ? DARLIN', I HAD ? ? THE BEST INTENTIONS ? ? BUT I DUG MYSELF A HOLE ? ? WITH A MODERN INVENTION ? ? AHH-HH... ? ? BABY, DID I MAKE YOU FEEL ? ? THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE A MIND ? ? TO RECONCILE THE TRUTH ? ? IN A TROUBLED TIME? ? ? SKIPPING MESSAGES ? ? GOOD MACHINES DON'T LIE ? ? AHH-HH... ? ? FROM HERE WE ROLL ON ? ? FROM HERE WE ROLL ON ? ? FROM HERE WE ROLL ON ? ? FROM HERE WE ROLL... ? ? ON ? ? FROM HERE WE ROLL ON ? ? FROM HERE WE ROLL ON ? ? FROM HERE WE ROLL ON. ? Dorian: THAT WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO DIE-- TO BE EATEN BY A SHARK-- YEP, A BIG SHARK.
