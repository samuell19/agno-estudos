Well they ain't sing'in nothin about me! Listen! "MORALES AND BARBAROSA TRADED PLACES IN THE EARTH..." How bout that?? Oh, here - heres - This is your part. "DON BARBAROSA WAS TRAVELING WITH A GRINGO CHILD." A Gringo Child? "AND THOUGH... ...THOUGH HE WAS ONLY A HALF PINT..." "...HE MEASURED UP TO THE QUART." That's pretty good! "MEASURED UP TO THE QUART." That ain't bad. Son of a bitch can write.. "EARLY NEXT MORNING... THEY TOOK THE GOLD AND SILVER." "...AND HAVEN'T BEEN SEEN SINCE." Good! "...AND THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE COURAGE... GREASE UP YOUR GUNS AND KNIVES." What? That's the part where they kill Barbarosa. Josephina... Do you know how long it's been? I come in the spring and I come in the fall. I come when I can. Yes - You come in the spring. You come in the fall. In the meantime - I wait and wait and wait. This hasn't been no bed of roses for me out there - you know. Don't tell me you don't like it. Well - it varies. That day we were working in the field. "Suddenly the earth began to shake, tremble." "The leaves fell..." Don't he ever get tired of that shit? "The dust covered the sun..." "Out of the darkness... came two men." "... on horseback." "RINCHES!" "Yes! Texax Rangers." "One was a Captain." "The other one - a young gringo." "The Captain said - We were Horse Thieves!" We should've killed 'em, Don Braulio. That was 30 years ago. "The Zavalas had a desire to kill the gringos..." "but not yet the will." "The RINCHE Captain shot me." "He was going to do it again." "But the young gringo stopped him." "They shot at each other." "The Captain fell dead." "...and the young gringo got it here." He wanted to help us. We thought that too! "We Took Care of him." "He worked in the fields to make us trust him." "He played with our children... ...to make us love him." "...and then he saw this young girl." Your OWN daughter - Don Braulio. "They were married against my wishes." "There was a ...a wedding fiesta." "We drank tequila." "The gringo was rude." "He cursed --- UGLY!" "So we took him outside on the patio, hoping he would sober up." "Then we came back inside - and I fell asleep." "I woke up in horror to see the gringo standing there before me." "...his rifle against my leg." "behind him, Marcelos and Tomas lay dead." "the gringo's beard that once had been the colour of honey..." "Now dripped red with blood." Barbarosa. Barbarosa! "...Red Beard." "He pointed his rifle at my knee; then he pulled the trigger." "...and shot my leg off." " He done the devils work." "He is the devil on earth." "God chose us to kill him." "...and should we ever falter in our holy pursuit," "Should even one Zavala complain or become afraid..." "...then God will put us back into houses ---- made of sticks and mud!" "...and take away our cattle and our goats." "...and our land and our sheep." but more terrible than losing all these things... You will have lost your pride... ...and your honor... ... and your dignity... ...and that you must never do... ...never! Don't yell or nothin! You're the gringo child? Yeah. - Is Barbarosa here too? - shhhh_ goddamn it. It's alright... I won't say nothing. they would try and kill him... and you too - maybe. yeah - I know. Everything alright? "Buenas Noches."

Damn right - I'm afraid. I'm afraid for Barbarosa. Yes, me too. I stay afraid. You take too many risks. Don't you think we have enough? No. I don't wanna have to eat another armadillo the rest of my life after we leave. I wanna go with you this time.. Tonight! Maybe next spring. You just don't wanna take me with you, do you!

BARBAROSA! Come On, KARL - let's go.. I had no idea she was your daughter. All we did was just talk - that's all. ... and I'll tell ya somethin' - I like her. I like her a lot. ...and I intend to visit her again. What do you think about that? Oh, I think that's fine. Well what are you so mad about? Because you stole that goddamn horse, and you stole it from the Zavalas. Oh well look at you - look at you... ...Look what you're ta__... You're talking about stealin'... I don't steal from my... I don't steal from my own people. Well it don't bother you to slit their throats on your weddin' night does it? Where'd you hear that. I heard Braulio tell it. He said ya was drunk.. Hell we were all drunk. Braulio saw to that. Said ... Said they threw you outside. Yeah, they did that too. Ay yah What else did they say? Well they said, you came back in... ...and killed Marcelo and Tom?s. You believe that? Well he said, you shot his leg off. did you do that? Yes I did that one. Why?

Hope you're happy - got the little son of a bitch stirred up enough. - Well he thinks it's you. You will never catch me sleeping again! Well I thought it'd scare him off. This Zavala will kill you. Old Braulio may have finally grow'd one "man" enough to do the job. Why can't we just MOVE from this part of the country. Move? Yeah. That's my family over there. BARBAROSA! Looky there - winter's comin'. Imagine my daddy's ... ...out there in his field, right now - plowin'. You miss all that? Don't do me no good to miss it. Does it.
