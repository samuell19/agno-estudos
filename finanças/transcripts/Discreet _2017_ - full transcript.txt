To find the unique hum that brings peace and tranquility. If we share in these discoveries, we can be heard by a million new friends. Our community will be strengthened and vibrational peace achieved. Now, let's begin. Take in the energy of the present and clear your mind. Trust that a waking life holds the answers to the mysteries of both past and future. I tried to call. I'm not early, am I? Breakfast. Oh wow, you didn't have to bring anything. Look at you. Hey. Well, it's true. The last year or so I really did become a recovery junkie. I'm glad to hear that's working for you. Um, about a year ago, I got tight with this one girl at AA. You wouldn't believe it, I was going to two meetings a day. I started helping her with this, um, Meals on Wheels kind of program that she was heading for shut ins and you know, all strangers to me. And, we... Went to this house. It's a little house out in the country down by the river. I'm only telling you this because you need to know. I can't have any more secrets between us if we are going to start over. Oh honey, I had every reason to believe that he was dead. You know that. I only said that because I wanted you to move on. You lied to me? It's okay. I'm here. The race war. Blacks coming together with Black Lives Matter in the barrios. You hear this phrase, "Viva la raza" from the illegals. "Long live the Mexican race." These groups are organizing and they're plotting and yet, if we say, "All Lives Matter" or "Blue Lives Matter" or god forbid, "White Lives Matter," we're racist. White people are being killed off by minorities at an alarming rate. And when you hear the democrats talk about gun control-- ♪ Oh yes you are ♪ ♪ And the way you roll your hands ♪ Hey, what's wrong? My front tire got stolen. Of your bike? - Yeah. I'm so sorry. And my mom's not home. You could get an Uber. No way. I'm not gonna pay to get home; that's stupid. So what are you gonna go after high school? I don't know, I mean, I wasn't really thinking college. It just seems like a waste of money. One of my neighbors, he backpacked through Europe when he was about my age, actually. He's probably your age by now. I'll be honest. The only place I've been to outside of Texas is Oklahoma. But, you know, maybe that's it. Maybe I just want to get the hell out of here. Oh Alex, I, I did what I could. Oh Alex, please don't leave. Hey there! Hi there. I don't think we've met, have we? I'm Lyel. I don't think so. I'm Don. Who do you know out here? I'm his grandson. Hell, you just about half his size. Just passin' through, I thought I'd stop in and say hi. Check in for a few days. Yeah. I see. Where you headed, Don? Oregon. Eventually. I don't mean to be rude, but, you mind showing me some ID? I guess not. Do you mind if I see yours? You have to understand, we're just protective of John. How many days did you say you were stayin'? I'll make sure I tell our little support group. Just a couple. Not very long. You know who I am. You can hear me. You hear that? Huh? I don't buy your bullshit. Huh? You feel that, don't ya? Oh you do feel that. Who's calling you, John? Hello? It's okay.

So please leave your thoughts at the beep. To every new day. - Hang on. How you doin'? Come on in. Can I offer you anything to drink? Tequila? There's also water. Okay. If you mind, go ahead and hand me your eyeglasses. I'm gonna set these on the nightstand right here. If you'll stand right here against the bed for me, facing that direction. That's fantastic. I'm gonna go ahead and blindfold you. Let me know if this is too tight. How is that? Alright. If you would go ahead and disrobe for me where you're standing. If you wouldn't mind taking your belt off, too, that would be great. That's great. I'm gonna walk you around the side of the bed here. And make a right. There you go. A few more steps. Go ahead and have a seat for me. I'm gonna pile all your clothes right here at the head of the bed. Hang on. How you doin'? Come on in. Can I offer you anything to drink? I have tequila, there's also water. I'm good. Stand right here for me. Face that direction. I'm gonna go ahead and blindfold you. Let me know if this is too tight. It's okay. I'm here. Okay guys, time's up. Hello. Welcome to another episode of Gentle Rhythms. My name is Mandy, and I'll be your companion and humbled guide on your journey toward vibrational peace. Tonight, I'd like to focus on intentional sleeping as a way of illuminating the path in front of you. Give yourself over to these discoveries and trust them on a cellular level. I call that schizophrenia. These people need treatment. They don't need us indulging them in their delusions. These people are sickos. There was a time when you'd shoot someone for that and no one would question you, but now it's getting closed minded. Hey, do you know if hey have free WiFi? Sorry, do they have free WiFi? Um, WiFi? Do you know how strong that signal is? Sorry. Alright. I found your videos online and, I was really inspired by it. They, um, they just, I feel like you're speaking to me. You know, it's been pretty helpful. But, you know, I mostly, I mostly shoot freeways and traffic. Freeways mostly. That's interesting. Yeah, 'cause, you know, I basically live on the road, so, film the rhythms, you know? Right? Find your rhythm. I think that's what you always say. But, I think it opened something up. Maybe it's your hum. I don't, I don't know. It's a little bit of a wild idea, but, I was thinking I could show you, like, actually bring it to you. To Portland? Or I could mail it to you. I mean, nothing about you. I'm just not feeling so good about the state of privacy these days. Do you know what I mean? And listen, um, I'm always on the road, so, it's not like it's putting me out. That sounds pretty tricky, Alex.

Didn't you hear me call? I heard the phone. Lyel mentioned you, but I know John don't have any relatives. Somebody with family don't live out here all alone. I just haven't seen him in a while. Mind if I step in and give old John a hug? He's asleep right now. You got somebody in there. And you don't wanna share. Next time that phone rings, answer it. I don't give a fuck who you are. And as I speak, cop haters, the illegal immigrants, the gays and transgendered, the Muslim refugees. You know where this is going, and it ain't pretty, folks. Our forefathers are puking in their graves, believe me. Hey, how's old Oregon doin'? Who's in the back, Lyel? Oh that's my sister's girl. You know I've never been out of Texas. Isn't that funny? I feel like I have though. You have a good day. Alright? I have a favor to ask. I have a friend who's kind of got a problem that maybe you might help. John! John! There you go. Good boy. You got a little bit right there. Alright, here we go. You ready? No struggling. Stop struggling. Good morning. I'm ready for a new day. She's on the phone now. Cassie, thank you for joining us and for coming forward. I applaud you. Thank you. Now tell us what you heard. Well, the first thing that I heard was laughter. It was kind of sudden and I was distracted when two noisy students who were behind me and when I turned to see who it was, I saw two... Stop it. That's gotta happen. I have a few questions prepared for you. Uh, so. Who do you think you are? What gives you-- I'm asking permission to be your little bitch boy, sir. Are you crazy? You know my wife checks the phone. You know that. Right. Sorry. So what? You calling for a reason, huh? When are you available, sir? Occupado.

He's a good looking boy, isn't he? Let's get you ready for bed. You've reached Mandy at Gentle Rhythms. Your feedback is key to a shared journey, so please leave your thoughts at the beep. To every new day. Hey. It's me. Uh, sorry I haven't called you. Been really busy with work. But I got the video. It's great. It's really, really great. So thanks for that. I've been thinking a lot about Oregon. I think we should do it. So call me back. Bye. You try the steak? It's good. Here you go, John. There's a good one. You ready? You ready? Yeah. I think he likes it. I really appreciate you coming by and doing this. It means a lot. You have plans this weekend? No, not really. You should be out, having fun. You want another one? Here it comes. Here it comes. John. What is your problem tonight? Why don't you try? Why? Because I'm paying you. Humor me. Scooch a little closer. Go ahead. There you go. You remember Zach, don't you, John? Go ahead. John. Dammit, John. Give me your hand. Hey. Come here. What are you doing? You remember him, huh? What are you doing? Shut up. You remember him, John? This is Zach. We were down by the river together. Do you remember me, John? Do ya? What the fuck? Stop moving. I remember you. You used to live upstairs from me. Stop moving. You fucking remember that? Let me go! I'm really sorry, Zach. I don't know who that was, but it's not me. Fucking monsters. You've reached Mandy at-- It's the last time. You hear me? Hurry up, man. Don't you ever come back here. I mean it. I want you to locate your tension with tonight's sleep. Consider asking yourself what new discoveries you make for your subconscious to reveal. Give yourself over to these discoveries and trust them on a cellular level. Our bodies always knows more than our minds. Alex. It's, it's two in the morning. I try to be nice about this, but I've pretty much reached my limit. What do you mean? You're harassing me. You might not think you are, and it might not make sense to you, but, that's what this is. I'm telling you politely and for the last time, okay? No more phone calls, no more emails, and I'm sorry, but you're not welcome here. Do not come to Portland. But that was the plan. No, that was never a real plan. I never agreed to that. Did you think I wanted to marry you? If you contact me again, I'll call the police. Okay, I don't know how else to get this through to you. Do you understand? I thought you were my friend. Mandy? I feel like you're not even listening to me. Yeah, I'll be better. I'm sorry. No wonder you don't have a Valentine's date. Oh fuck. You sound like a robot. It just, sometimes, you know, it's weird. Can I call you back? Is there any way I can call you back? Whatever, we're good. No, I'm gonna call you right back. It's okay. No.
