Subtitles by explosiveskull The police department has announced the suspension of protection in crime-ridden housing projects effective immediately. The homicide rate is at its highest in 40 years. Community activists fear the projects, known as Brick Mansions, will become a no-go zone. Police checkpoints will monitor all movement in and out of Brick Mansions. The mayor's spokesperson confirmed the closure of schools and hospitals within the restricted area. Gentlemen, this development is a beacon of light in our dark city. Eco-friendly residences, exclusive shops and offices. All situated on 20 acres of the most valuable property that this city owns. Now, with your cooperation and your backing, we can restore Detroit to its former glory. Just in time for re-election. I am so glad that we share the same bright vision of the future. Mr. Mayor, this land is currently the Brick Mansions housing projects. In order for this to go up, that has to come down. Yes. What future do you envision for the people currently living there? Well, as your mayor I can assure you that all the people of this fine city will be taken care of. Gentlemen, to the future. - Yo, yo, yo. - What's up? - Check that shit out. - Yo, who is that? I don't know. What's cookin', my brothers? Your ass better keep on rollin', dawg. Change the shocks on that bike, too. - Whatcha doing here, K2? - Come on now, why the hatin'? I thought you all Towers was about unity and shit, like Malcolm X. Damn shame, got no niggas like those no more. - All we got is that punk-ass nigga Tremaine. - Tremaine keeps his Towers fed. Why don't you take your fat ass back to Tremaine's block, homey? Little man got jokes. I got no beef with you all. I'm looking for Lino. He borrowed something of ours. - Lino ain't here. - Nah. I'm gonna bet Lino's up there right now, thinking he can change the ghetto 20 kilos at a time. - I bet you ain't gonna find out. - Whoa! I'm gonna leave you my number. And when Mr. Clean comes back, you tell him to give me a call. Damn white sons of bitches are good to write on. - Skin like paper. - Come on, K2... Which apartment? Find them! Catch him, man! Come on! Do you know where Lino stay at? - Yes! - Good, show me the way. - Where? - Right! Right! Right, right! Right. Down the hallway. Last door. You. Knock this fucking door down. One... Two... Move! Catch this bastard. Lock this piece-of-shit building down! - She is cute. - She got a great ass, man. - Hi, kids. - Hey, Lino. Aw, hell no! Tremaine's gonna slice both y'all. - What do we do? - Who's "we?" I'm gonna kill this motherfucker! - Come here! - Get him! Aah! Motherfucker's on the roof. - Aah! - Catch this bastard! God damn it! Don't let him get away! Aww, shit. How much do you need? Okay. Well, we'll see what we can do. But never call my cellular phone again. Who gave K2 my number? I can't believe he contacted me directly. You know what he said that black Sasquatch... Excuse me! Are you picking your nose at my table? Mr. George, I wasn't picking it. This is a classy place, not the mobile abode where you were raised. Look at Damien. Takes pride in his appearance. Hygiene. Knows how to exist in the civilized world. Isn't that why your father sent you to me? Hmm?! - Yes, sir. - Where was I? K2 calling. K2 loses a package. Needs another 20 before Tremaine flips out. Best part? He wants it delivered. Like some seven-figure Chinese take out. Guess where? Brick Mansions. Now who wants to venture into that shithole - on a Friday night? - I would. Think you can handle it? I handle what needs handling. All right. My mama be turning in her grave if she seen me adding this much pepper to her curry goat recipe. You know what I appreciate about my mama's recipe? You get the right ingredients follow the proper instructions, you can never go wrong. Which leads me to this morning, K2. I believe you had the right ingredients. You had every man we had to spare and clear instructions. Bring back Lino and my 20 kilos that he jacked from you. Yet here we are. No Lino. No kilos. Look, Big Dawg. Me and Rayzah, you know. Don't you go blaming this on no woman, dawg! That's five of my men died today because of your little shit show. That's five more funerals. Five more severance packages I gotta send out. - - Now tell me, nigga. Why shouldn't I make it six? Now, I pay good money for the service around here. I need some good ideas. You got any good ideas? How about you, Smiley? Any ideas? No, sir. And that's six funerals. Shall I make it seven? Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Lino got a girl. Back in the day, he helped her get out of the hood. We grab that bitch, and I swear he's gonna come around. You know where she's at? Yeah. We know where she at. Don't come back here without her. Yo. Trust me, man. All right. That's him. George the Greek. How long will you have been with me now, Damien, a year? Yeah, about that. It's a good time for you to see what we are all about. Where are you going? Go park the car in the back. Pick it again and I'll kill you. Sorry, Mr. George. Cheng, how's it going? You kill me, Cheng. You kill me. Damien, Cheng. Cheng, Damien. Hmm. You're a man of many talents. I try. Shit, I can't see anything. Cheng, you have some change for me? Cool. I've lost 'em. You ever been to Southeast Asia, Damien? No, I've never been there. He's found the stash. Hey, prep me 20 ki. Twenty. It's a rush. In Southeast Asia, the poppies grow by the side of the road, which is why the dope there is worth shit. But every time it crosses a border, it triples in value. It used to be that by the time it got to the States, there was only so much profit you could squeeze. And then we got Brick Mansions. Our very own border, and it's less than a mile away. I went to a business school. The best business school in the world. Four years. Half a million bucks. You just have to remember one thing. People pay the most for what they cannot get. - Can I have that GPS? - Got it. The routes are pre-programmed. - Don't lose it. - Hey, boss, that fancy school say anything about dealing with cops staking us out? How the hell did they know we're here? How did they know we are here? We weren't supposed to be here. No one knows we're here unless that person is already here. I told him, fucking told him. Damien, you take this. Take them out. In the sewers! Let's go! Let's go! Go to the mono marker. Come up clean! All teams go! Damien, follow me. Yeah, you're right. What the hell are you doing? Put it down! Nobody move. Those are my friends outside. And you're all under arrest. Now, I want you all to put your guns in the tank. Put 'em in the tank! Get down on the ground. We're gonna hang out for my buddies. Let's move! Let's go! Where the fuck are you? Meet me in the south side of the building. Let's go! Where are they? We got a situation. Who speaks Chinese? Fuck! Okay. Get this bastard off my car! Faster! No! Damn, this kid is determined. Do you have anything stronger? I like it. Keep it steady. Shit! I got him! What the...! Shit! Aah! Get out of the car! Get out of the car now! That's George the Greek. Check your most wanted list. I'm Detective Collier. Undercover narcotics. - Show us your ID. - Sure. Prick. You're next. - ID, please. - I'll handle this. You're all right. I'll take over. - How long do you need? - One hour tops. Here you go, sir. Can I help you, ma'am? Ooh-la-la, Lola. Nurse Clara, there she is. What you been up to? Just trying to keep up with that rascal grandfather of yours. - So you miss me? - Yes. Nice. When are we going out? What, is this the 11th time you've asked me? - So you're keeping track? - I'm sure you're really good guy - and an even better date, but... - What's that supposed to mean? The parade of women I've seen you bring through this place. Come on, that's all for the grandpa. He lives vicariously through me. Well, when you're ready to live your life for a little less of a thrill, why don't you give me a call? What he doing out there anyways? He thinks we don't know what he's up to. Are you kidding me? Come on. - I'm gonna have to kick his old ass. - All right. - I'll see you. Twelfth time is a charm. - Can't wait. Grandpa, what was our deal? One a day. Well, what's all that down there on the ground? Come on. How many pleasures I got left, huh? I can't even enjoy reading my paper. Explain this to me. He's a bad guy, and we took him down. Damien, I buried a son who thought taking down bad men was more important than keeping a good one alive. I don't wanna bury my grandson, too. Most of what you read in here is blown out of proportion. You can't believe everything that you read. Like where it says: "The unidentified undercover, hanging on at 80 miles an hour..." Exaggeration. "Over 300 rounds fired." It was like a hundred rounds. Maybe. I am so close to taking down Tremaine. So close to making him pay. Revenge and justice are not the same thing. - They never are. - You say that every time. You are all I've got left. And I'm going to be around for a very long time because I'm a very healthy old man, okay? I'm not going anywhere. I promise you. Well, if you're not going anywhere, before you go, - there's a certain... Well... - Clara. - Yeah, Clara. - I'm getting there. I'll be dead before you get there at the rate you're going. - You see that guy over there? - Yeah. His grandson is a famous athlete. He couldn't get to first base with her. Maybe you could brag about me a little bit. - Put in a good word for me. - I do all the time. All right, so here's the deal. I'll get this one last scumbag. I'll settle down with a girl like Clara. And you keep these to one a day. Ha. I'll cut these out altogether right now and you forget about going after that last scumbag. Yeah. Just like I thought. Move, bitch. Mmm. Yo, Latina, where you from? Brazil, Mexico? What's going on here, Rayzah? Nothing. Let me get down to business. Lola, please. What do you want? Your boyfriend. I don't have a boyfriend. What, you and old Lino broke up? Ain't seen him in years. - That's not what I heard. - Really? Well, I guess you'll just have - to add me to the list then. - And what list is that? The list of people who don't give a shit about what you heard. Oh, that's cute. You listen to this. I suggest we get along. Because your pretty ass ain't going nowhere until Lino shows up. - Hey, Lola. - Lino, what the hell are you doing? If you're going to be mad, I can go. This is some bullshit, I know it. Can you two work out your relationship issues when he don't got a gun to my throat? Him having a gun to your throat is the issue with our relationship. Everybody, just cool down. Take the shot? Nigga's got this fucking .45 against my neck. - He's mine. - Everybody, cool out. Move! You too. Tell Thyroid Gland to step off. Ease back. Back! Let's negotiate. Talk is cheaper than blood, man. Stop selling dope in the neighborhood. End of negotiation. Don't shoot! Let this mad man through. One-time offer, Lino. I forget about the 20 ki's. Let you go back to your pretty tower, live in peace. And we stay out of each other's business. Not good enough. How far are we gonna walk before one of these niggas put a shot in your back? - Maybe you get hit. - Back! Maybe I get hit. Maybe we all die. Maybe your pretty girl get hit. Back off! My boys are going to kill you, Frenchy. Then go back and burn down your pretty building to the ground! And for what, huh?! There ain't no more heroes around here, Lino. I'm not so sure about that. Come on, you son of a bitch! Move! Un-fucking-real. He's locked the door from the outside. Fucking serious? Open the door. Thyroid Gland's a little sensitive about his weight. Get out! Aah! The only way out of this ghetto is with a tag on your chest. That's why they call it a ghetto. Shut up, move. Not my Mustang, Lino. That's my baby. Keys! Son of a bitch! - Get back! - Lola, drive. Move! - You scratch my whip, woman, you gonna regret it. - Shut up. - In the back. - Man, I'm six feet three. I can't fit back there. You're about to get a couple of inches shorter. Fuck. If you scratch my car, you're gonna pay for it. We're going in on these bitches! Get 'em, Rayzah. Shoot the tires! Shoot! You crazy, woman! You know how much a transmission in one of these costs?! I'll take care of it. I promise. There's no place out of here, Lino. Just let me out. You can keep the damn car. Always negotiating, huh? It's the end of the road for you, brother. - For you, yes. Take us out, Lo. - With pleasure. Stay right there! Open that door! Drop it! Drop the weapon! Don't shoot. Don't shoot! Get back. Get out of the car! We're here to see your captain. Don't shoot. Get back! - We need to talk to him. Stay cool. - Back off. - Look at my fucking car. - Shut up, move! This is Tremaine Alexander. I'm sure you know him. Yes, we know him. Put your gun down, son. Don't shoot. I just come for Tremaine. Nobody move. Everybody stay cool. Put your gun down, son. Give me your weapon. You did good. - Lock him up! - Wait! What the hell are you doing?! Let me out of here! Hey! Hey! Sons of bitches! Let me out! Hey, Mike. How's that new house you got? Never mind. Get out of here, Tremaine. Gonna be hard to keep it up on a military salary. Guess my donation's been coming in handy, huh? - Come on, Miss Lola. - I ain't going anywhere with you. Tremaine! You son of a bitch! I'll kill you! Let me go! It's all politics, Lino. I'm a politician. America ain't no different than back home. You were just seeking a better life in a broken system. Problem is you think you can save Brick Mansions. I know it's just another third world country. They don't give a shit about us. C'est la vie. No! Open the door! Open this fucking door now! - You can go. - Yes, sir. You gave her to those animals, you dirty piece of shit! Sorry, son. Way of the world. Like the man says, tuition fees are a killer. Aah! Detective Collier? The mayor's ready to see you. Detective, come in. Detective Collier, Tom Berringer. I was on the force with your dad. Nice to meet you. The Collier family has a distinguished history with the city. Damien's father led the last police raid in the Brick Mansions. His unfortunate death pushed legislation for us to erect the border. He was a real hero. From what I hear you're a lot like him. You have somewhat of an expertise in terms of that neighborhood. Yeah, I know it pretty well. And who are we? Major Reno. U.S. Army. Division of Developmental Warfare. - Pleasure. - Detective, there's a situation that demands the best of the best. Last night, a government transport traveling at a time and route with minimal civilian traffic was hijacked. What were they transporting? NAD. Neutron assisted device. A neutron bomb. We prefer the word "device." Bomb has such negative connotations. The device was fitted with an anti-theft mechanism which is triggered... if the case should be opened the wrong way. Device activated. What the fuck? This is not good. Close it up, man. This is a precaution should it fall into the hands of the enemy. We need you to infiltrate, locate the device, and contact us for the code to disarm it. No, it can't be done. It would take time, planning. We don't know where it's at. We don't know who has it. We know where. Brick Mansions. And we know who. I've spent my entire career trying to take down Tremaine. But he never leaves Brick Mansions and there's checkpoints everywhere. You know the routes around them. Yeah, but then what? You have no intel inside. No eyes. We have your eyes. Lino Dupree. French Caribbean expat. Spent most of his adult life in Brick Mansions. Knows it like the back of his hand. So the best idea you could come up with was to send me into this shit with a convict as my partner Yeah. And you got ten hours, detective. And that's if he cooperates. He will. Tremaine's got his girlfriend. What's he locked up for anyway? Killed a cop. You sure know how to sell. Open C-12, please. Dupree, let's go. Transfer. - Get in the van! - Get in! Need a hand? What's the point? We're still in here. Not for long. I'll be back. Thanks. Yeah, have a good day. Hey! Hey. Wait! I need the van. You kidding me? Who do you think you are, man? You trying to jack me? Is that what you're trying to do? I don't think so. This is my van. It's my van. But if you want a lift, hurry up. The bus is leaving. Recalculating itinerary. - Where are you going? - Brick Mansions. There's no way you could drive this van past the barricades. Two minutes ago we were handcuffed and in the back of this thing. Why are you going to Brick Mansions? I'm after Tremaine Alexander. He killed a friend of mine. The same asshole kidnapped my girlfriend. - Ex-girlfriend. - Sounds like we got something in common. - How do you plan to get inside? - There's an old smuggling route. Take a right at 50 meters. Attention, prison van This is the police. Pull over. Better buckle up. - I prefer to be free. - Suit yourself. I repeat. Pull your vehicle over now. Attention, all units. This is Sergeant Mahoney. Do not pursue the prison van. - What's going on? - Let the van go. - That's an order. - Copy. That's a checkpoint. Maybe we should just pray that this GPS is right. Wrong direction. Please make a U-turn now. Oh, shit! Stop your vehicle now! I repeat, stop your vehicle now! What are you doing? Are you crazy? You need to trust me, man! Ah, shit. God, I can't see shit. Shit. The steering's gone. Brakes are gone! And now we're gone. Shit. - Old smuggling route, huh? - Yeah. We got to get the hell out of here, man. Not "we." What the hell are you doing? - You're a cop. - Are you crazy? Come on. I can smell cops a mile away. Hey, come on. You can't leave me like this. Come on! Help me get out. What am I supposed to do? Look in the police manual under "shit happens." Yeah, that's really funny. French asshole! What you doing here, pretty boy? Heh. Shit. This is your car, huh? Hell yeah. It's my ride. Brakes failed, man. So you get me out of here, we'll sort this out. Your health about to fail you now. Shit! - He's in. - Collier's good. Question is can he locate the device in three hours? If they can stay alive. The fire department can't send their trucks in without them getting shot up. It's a jungle. That's right. You're dead. Look at you. Yo, put that shit down. Put it down. Que pasa, mamasita? Hope you've been enjoying our accommodations. Hey, look. You keep it cool with me, I'll keep it cool with you. I'm not really into material things like that, but that Mustang Cobra, I loved it like I love cooked food. Obviously, you don't love it that much. It's under powered. What the fuck are you talking about? 100 g's of American engineering, and you let some chop shop put after-market rims on it? It throws off the balance. Certain people just manage to screw up anything. You're some kind of mechanic now? What do you know? Maybe I have a lawyer friend who has one. Lawyer friend? That's who's been keeping that hot pussy all warm while Lino's running around destroying my streets? I so don't miss this place. I'll bet there's not too many lawyer friends coming down to your diner with a Mustang Cobra. That's my part-time job. For the record, law is my passion. I work at a law firm in the morning, City College at night. I'm impressed, Miss Independence. So what you gonna do when you get your degree? I plan to petition for community rights. People like you remind me why everyone hates us. You know, I dress like this because I'm refined. A man of knowledge. That's why I'm a boss, not my guns. Take it. I try to impress education on my boys over here, but they're a different breed. If they're not out capping niggas in the streets, they're in some dark room, cappin' 'em on a video screen. So I give 'em a job, you know. At least they can feed their families. Look, between me and you, I like Lino. He has a cause. Even if it gets him killed. That's Brick Mansions bullshit. You and him are a lot alike. - I can see why y'all are together. - Separated. Well, don't worry, mamasita, your hero will be here soon. Oh, you didn't hear the good news? Lino escaped. I'm sure he's going to be coming here. And I wouldn't want to be you all when he gets here. Tremaine, we all good on the roof if you want to head back over. Hey, counselor, I got some business to handle. While I'm gone, Rayzah here'll keep you company. Crazy. What the fuck I told you? Don't you put your hands on my chips again. Move! Fuck! How'd you know I was a cop? You smell like a cop. You don't belong here. How'd you find me? I put a bug in your pocket. Cop tricks. That's all you people have. No, we have the law, which is something you don't care about. The law means nothing without justice. That's pretty high-minded for somebody who killed a cop. That cop was a corrupt piece of shit, no better than Tremaine. I'm here to find Tremaine. I'm here to find him before a weapon he hijacked kills everybody inside of Brick Mansions. Probably didn't occur to you that somebody on the outside could actually give a shit about what happens in here, now, did it? Where's the evidence? Standing right in front of you. Believe it or not, not everybody out there is an asshole just like not everybody in here is a junkie or a thief. But you enjoy yourself. And if I find your girlfriend, I'll tell her you said, " Hi." Tremaine is a monster. You have no idea who you're dealing with. I know exactly who I'm dealing with. - You don't know how to get in. - I'll figure it out. - With your police tricks? - Whatever it takes. They will shoot you and take your badge as a trophy. At least I'll die trying, which is a hell of a lot better than sitting around bitching about how the world sucks. I got a plan to get us in. Us? If you're not bullshitting about that bomb, maybe I can save Lola before we all go down. Heh. And the first chance you get, what are you going to do? You gonna put a bullet in the back of my head? I could've killed you already. So what's your plan? - You got a phone? - Yeah. Tremaine. It's Lino. I'm coming over. So that's it? You just throw us in the lion's den? Which no lion would ever expect. This is going to be a lot of fun. Not bad, right? Unh-unh. Unh-unh-unh. Ooh-la-la, Lola. Aah! Safe words are for pussies. The important thing to remember is that the more it hurts you, the better it feels for me. - Aah! - Where are you going?! Huh? I knew you'd be fun to play with from the second I saw you. How do you like that, huh? I really love this game. You wanna act like a bitch? - Heel! - Hey, Rayzah. I heard shouts. You can play, but not too hard, okay? You are one lucky bitch. Hey, what's up, guys? What do we got here? Take us to Tremaine. K2, get your fat ass up here! We got guests comin'. Yeti, move it! Upstairs now! Showtime! Damien, see that? Lino! Surprised to see you back here so soon. - You see, he is surprised. - Who's your boy? - I'm his driver. - He's a cop. - Come for his bomb. - Thanks. That's... that's great. Wow. A real live cop. Haven't seen one of those around here in years. I believe the police station closed around the same time as the school, the hospital, and all them other things the government thought we didn't need around here. So what, you the new sheriff in town? I must admit you're a brave man. Where's Lola? No woman, no cry. The big man, he sang it better. We'll get to that. Let's talk about this bomb. You here to buy it? No, I came to disarm it. That thing's gotta make you a little bit anxious tickin'. Tremaine Alexander don't do anxious. I cause anxious. Now, I could be halfway down south before this thing goes off or you could make me and my peeps an offer. I'll offer to disable it before it blows us all up. You like that? Oh, that won't fly. How about I just send it back the way I found it? K2, let the sunshine in. Gentlemen, please, you're gonna love the view. Only a crazy person would have a rocket. When you live in a war zone, you prepare for war. Now, this thing is rigged to fly straight downtown at a push of a button. Let's talk numbers. You'd let all those people die over money? That's low, even for you. Nigga, where I come from, cash rule everything around me. You know that one, right? First, I need to know Lola is okay. Rayzah, bring the girl into view. Curtain number three! What do you see? What do you see, Lino? No! No, no! Wait! No, wait! - You wanna die here, man? - Don't shoot! - Calm down, man! - No! You gotta calm down! Tremaine! Calm down! Now's not the time! Lino, not now. Now you boys are all excited let's do this shit the uptown way, on the auction-block, all right? I got a rocket, I got a bomb, and I got a pretty woman. I say we start the biddin' at $10 million, huh? - Do I hear 11? - Eleven. - Eleven million! - Twelve. Oh, that's a spicy bid right there. We're getting there now! - Fifteen! - Fifteen! Now, stop the bullshit! You tell me how much it's worth to you. How much are those people downtown worth? Because around here, we don't seem to be worth shit. Look around, sheriff, this used to be a five-star palace. Doormen, women waitin' on tables. Where them bitches at now? In the alley shootin' it up or giving somebody brain? Because of drug dealers like you. I didn't cause this reality. I just help them ease the pain. Now cut the bullshit, and let's get back to that money. It was at 15 million, right? - Fifteen. - Do I hear 20 million? Okay, stop the game, what's it gonna take? You got three million people downtown. $10 per person, price of a happy meal. That's $30 million for me. - Then 30 million? - Thirty million. Done. Thirty million it is. Thirty million. Sold! To Lino Dupree and the new sheriff of Brick Mansion! Call your people and make it happen. And, Lino, stay outta my business. - Yes. - Detective Collier. Collier, why aren't you using the encrypted phone I gave you? It's a long story. Where are we now? We're close, really close. Close enough to punch the code in? No. Unfortunately, no. - What's the problem? - The new owner wants to sell. Are you sure the bomb is there? Yes. I can tell you that there's only 48 minutes before it blows up. Okay. How do we proceed? You have a Hawaiian bank account? I want it in cash, man. They can't do cash. We still got an account in Hawaii? - We do. - Give him the numbers. Bank 83675. Bank 83675. - Account 021084. - Account 021084. - 6098Z. - 6098Z. What's he asking? $30 million. Hold on. Tremaine wants 30 million for the device. The city's damn near broke. - That's a non-starter, detective. - All right. Good. You have to find another solution. Exactly. All right, good, yeah. Perfect. That's a wrap. They're sending the money. - Let's go disable that bomb. - Hold on. Wait a minute. Let my man verify the funds first. Bank doesn't open for another 25 minutes. Ah, 25 minutes. Well, that's just enough time for me to finish dinner. K2, show our guests to the Presidential Suite. - Nice doing business with you, sheriff. - Move! Sometimes you don't gotta be a rocket scientist, just gotta have a rocket. What's going on over there? What the fuck do you care? Huh? I'm still gonna cut your ass off even if the city pays. Them paying depends on two things. Oh, really? And what's that? If they think your man's bluffing. My man Tremaine don't bluff, bitch. I'm sorry. What was the second thing? My man Lino. Go see what the fuck's going on over there. What are you fucking deaf? Go see what's going on. Move! Face the rack. - On your knees. - Shit. Hands behind your head! I cannot be here. I'm claustrophobic. You move, he kills you. If you talk, he kills you. If you breathe. He gonna give me a kiss? K2, you know you said he kills you. You mean that? Till Tremaine get his 30 mil, their lives is worth more than both of ours. Put it this way. They die, you die. Okay. See where not having a plan gets you? Hey, you know where the bomb is. I know where Lola is. And in 25 minutes, we're heroes. In 25 minutes, Tremaine's gonna shoot us and that device is gonna kill three million people. But when he gets his money, everybody walks away. There is no money. The city can't pay. I was just trying to buy us some time. Forget what I said before. Don't trust your instincts. They're shit. I should've killed Tremaine when I had the chance. Shut up. Wait. That story about Tremaine killing your friend, it's true? It was my father. He was leading some officers on a drug raid. He got separated from his squad. Tremaine's boys captured him and killed him. I'm sorry. Let's go make him pay. I need to get out. - I need to get out. - Shut up! I need to get out. I need to get out! - Shut up! - I need to get out. Help him, man! - Yes, sir. - Stop it! Stop! Son of a bitch! - What happened? - Oh, shit! - What? - He's not breathing. - What? - We gotta get him out of here. Well, fix it. Ah, come on! He's not breathing! Come on! Okay, come on, go, go! - Open the gate. - You're the boss! Hurry up and get out! Go! Freaks. Something don't feel right about this, man. You think they'll come up with the money? - We'll see. - Tell me how you got that bomb again. This dude at the base told me about some weapons being moved. No profile, no convoy. Shit was easier than high school pussy. See, that's what's bothering me, man. You can never trust "easy." - I'm okay. - You're crazy. We're out of the room. Your turn, cop. Is this some kind of game to you? Ready for a backflip? - On three. - Three! Hey! Catch them! - Come on, get them! - Go, go, go! You know where we're going? More or less! Shit! Damien! What the fuck?! Different method. Same results. Let's go! KS, they're moving outside the building. I'm on these bitches one time. It's faster. But you still need the key. I see 'em around the corner. Go! Go! - I drive! - Get 'em! Come on! Don't shoot. The next nigga to shoot my car is gonna die a lot slower than that. - Let's get these guys! - Come on, man! Faster. - Faster! - What, you wanna drive? - Yeah, go ahead and drive! - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - I need to get out! - What are you trying to jump out the damn car for? - Where are you going? - I'm trying to get rid of these guys. Will you shut up? Ha! I don't see them. Where are they? - Who taught you how to drive? - Who taught you to speak English? The rooftop's back that way! Why didn't you tell me that? Come on, tell me! Which way? Which way are we... Left! Left! Lola and your bomb are back there! - We don't have much time! - Back where? Damn! Stay down. Shit. Come on! I told you to stay down! Look, we can't just go running up onto that rooftop. That's where they're gonna be expecting us. You got a better solution? - I'm working on it. - Can you work and run? Whoa. Tremaine's gonna wild out. No! This way! They went around the corner. Let's get these fuckers. Stay down this time. They're in the bus! Shoot them! You go around. - Let's split up! - Meet up behind the building. Damien! - Brick on windshield. - I got it. - On three! - Three! What the...? - Shit. - Close enough now? Thank you. What the fuck? Get Defense on the line, immediately. Yes, sir. Hello. What? Okay. I'm gonna bring it up right now. We have an issue. These are satellite surveillance images from Brick Mansions taken several minutes ago. There's the bomb. And what's that? That's an old Russian surface missile. Has a radius of about five miles. How the hell did they get that? Wait. Wait. If they launch that thing... - The city is ground zero. - We're gonna have to evacuate. - No time. - There's a fallout shelter. It won't help us against an NAD blast. What options do we have then, drone? Too late, we'll never get authorization just like that. - The bank's open. - I'll check. I think they fooled us. No deposit. And you wonder why we can't fucking trust the government. What the hell is going on? Not only did they not make the transfer... - they're emptying all our accounts. - Crooked evil bastards! I'm gonna blow them fucks. Rayzah, the motherfuckers didn't pay. We're gonna launch! Stay clear. Time's up, bitch. Downtown is about to get remodeled. Sorry, girl, you'd have made a good lawyer. What the fuck was that? Fucking Russian piece of shit! There goes the controller. Now I wanna get her out of the picture. Be careful! You'll hit Lola. Nah, I wanna get this one away from her. Trem, they took out the fuckin receiver! Now, I gotta shoot the sheriff and the deputy. Damn it. I'm out of ammo. Let's go. Brick Mansion gangsters! It's time to strap up, boys! We ride or we die! What was that? Looks like they shot out the launch mechanism. Missile can't launch. We're still in the game. I want the building sealed down! Nobody in, nobody out. Tremaine's here. It means he's gonna push the button by hand. There's no way we're gonna get up there in time. Not up, over. Seal the building off! Yeti, with me. Move it! Grr! - That sucks. - Excuse me. One, two... Hey, what are you doing? Three, four, five... Hey, stop that. Six, seven. Hey, this, this is a bad idea. I believe you said we were gonna do it or die trying. It's an expression. Don't think. Jump, all instinct. It's a really bad idea. Aah! Take 'em out. Block this exit, man. Be easy enough for a man of your size. How much time? We got plenty. Got a plan? Kick his ass. Don't get squashed. I'm going! I'm going! I'm going! I'm going! Oh, shit! - On three? - Three. Three! Ahh! What are you doing? Hurry up! He's really pissed off! Hey, hey! Hey, hurry! Whew! That was fucking awesome. "In this great future you can't forget your past." I told you, Tremaine, don't bluff. No, Tremaine Alexander don't bluff, nor do I make a stupid bet. Loosen her chains. This game is over. - What are you talking about? - I'm a businessman. I'm not gonna kill no millions of people. I'm gonna have the sheriff and the hero come disarm this thing and get it out of here before we all get fried. You gone soft. You watch your tone, woman. Watch my tone? What is wrong with you?! What the fuck am I supposed to tell the boys? I don't care what you tell the boys. Untie the girl! Then maybe I should just kill you and do this myself. Shit! No! I can always use a good lawyer. Sorry for all this, counselor. Step away from her. It's okay. It's okay. So glad you boys came to save everyone, man. Not everyone. Hey, Lino, they're gonna text the code. You punch it in. Now get down on your knees. No, wait! Let him explain. You gonna shoot an unarmed man, sheriff? At least you're gonna see it coming. It's better than my father got. What I have to do with your father? Lieutenant John Collier. Collier? They still blaming me for that one? He was shot raiding your headquarters. Raid? They never entered the building, man. I saw the whole thing through my surveillance camera. His own men shot him in the back, left him for dead on my doorstep. Cold-blooded set up. You're full of shit. Now get down on your knees. Get down on your knees! Damien, there is a problem. What? The number didn't come through? No, it did. 48216. - That's... - Our ZIP code. That's all right. Punch it in. It wasn't supposed to be here. The code, it's our zip. It's a set up. Proceed to evacuation immediately. - Punch it in. - Listen to the man. - They're playing you for a fool the way they played your father. - Shut up! Punch in the damn code. Give me that. Think about it. Why is it our ZIP code? Don't you see? The army lost a bomb that only kills people in one place where people are prowling. But the bomb has been stolen. Yes, and the van hijacked. That's the story they gave you. How come the van had no traces of that harpoon anywhere on it? It's a coincidence. Give me the phone. My instinct says you're arming it. Give me the phone. - Lino! - Sorry, partner. Proceed code to cancel. 4-8-2... You're gonna get us all killed. Back off. Back off. Stop, both of you! - Lido, stop! - Please evacuate now. Okay. No! Damien! Please! - Hurry up! - Evacuation... Oh, God. - Collier! - Twenty seconds. You die now or wait five seconds and we all die together. Danger. Ten seconds. Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Countdown completed. Joke's on me. The law never protected this place before. Why would it start now? I've done many bad things, but killing your father wasn't one of them. "Making Detroit safer for all." Welcome to our world. So what are we gonna do with this shit? Let's give it back. Be careful, captain. It's very hot. Thank you, son. Move! - Move! - Let's go! Hey, caveman! Come on, no stairs, elevator. Let's go now now now! This is better than the stairs. Yeah. - I can't reach him. - We don't have a satellite image, but if the bomb went off, we would have heard it. I don't like this. I don't like this at all. He's our man. He'll get back to us. Hello. What do you mean they're inside the building? Hey, you boys remember Lino? My eyes in Brick Mansions. Well, he showed me a lot. Wow, Mr. Mayor. Great place you got here. Tremaine Alexander. You could say I'm like the mayor of Brick Mansions. It's a pleasure to meet my constituaries. And on behalf of myself, our new appointed sheriff, and Lino, and the great citizens of Brick Mansion... we decided to give you a campaign contribution. Device activated. What's going on? Believe it or not, I forgot the damn code. So what was it again? - Four... - Detective... - Eight... - We can take it from here. Two, one... - Six. - You sure about that? I think, Lino, you said it couldn't be six because that was the ZIP code for Brick Mansions and that would be too much of a coincidence. You said it was a coincidence. I said they wanted to blow us up. This guy. I think all this jumping around on rooftops has loosened his marbles. You hit your head one too many times. You're having a hard time remembering. We'll take it right from... I'm pretty sure the last number is six. Mr. Mayor, do you wanna press the button? Or do my man Damien gotta do it? Go for it, Mayor, give her a push. Stop! Stop! Enough! What the hell happened out there? You had a direct order. You played me just like you played my father. Yeah, and your empathy made you soft, just like your father. I have to make the tough decisions for this city, and I sent this bomb in there to get rid of its biggest problem. Come on. You know it. They're no better than animals. Animals! Who's animals? Men struggling to survive? Or men who would destroy a whole community of underprivileged women and children? As mayor, I have to do what's best for all the people of this city. - The hard working ones. - You mean the rich ones. The ones that contribute. The ones that are sick and tired of that cesspool. Cesspool? You need to wake up, my man. These people are rising up. And the people... Check this out. They're sick of you. You can catch it on the news in about five minutes. The mayor of Detroit was arrested today after a compromising video, posted online, appeared to show him plotting an attack on Brick Mansions residence. And I sent this bomb in there. The demolition of walls that divide the city from the Brick Mansions projects will begin next month. With no date set for new elections, the acting mayor announced plans to reopen schools, hospitals and police stations in the district immediately. In the Tremaine Alexander trial, the jury has delivered a guilty verdict. The judge declared in light of Mr. Alexander's commitment to the community, she would give him the minimum five-year sentence. - A little rough around the edges, but... - Yeah, not bad.
