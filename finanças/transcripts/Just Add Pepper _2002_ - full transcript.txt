[man's monotone voice] Hello. Hello. Welcome. Is this on? Um, I'm very glad you're all are here. [cough, clears throat ] Piper Nigrum, a plant from which we grind its fruit to create pepper. Pepper, a pungent spice. Pepper, considered the most commonly used spice, besides salt. The blue cheese and Parmesan soufflé, the Hungarian goulash, and the holiday favorite smoky bacon cheese and hot pepper corn bread, all contain pepper. When preparing a successful recipe, people generally have a strong opinion about pepper. Most tend to love it. A few hate it. But for some, pepper is an acquired taste. [wind blowing through trees, birds chirping, water flowing] [melancholy music] [water splash] [water splash] Your grandfather has tried to kill himself Pepper. Pepper! You gotta do... Pepper! Pepper! Pepper! You've got to save your grandfather. Help him. [loud gasp] Goddamnit I gotta get out more. [upbeat rock] [alarm clock bell] Grandpa. You OK in here? God damn kid. It's admiral. I'm fine. Now get the hell out of here Cubby! You in there? Yeah. What's it to you? Come on man. I got to take a leak! Forget it man. I know why you want the bathroom. It's because she's coming home today. If I give you the bathroom, you're going to be in here for hours. Getting ready! Come on Cub! I got to take a leak. Fine! Don't say I didn't warn you. Aww! Jesus Cub! What'd you eat? A dead cat? Um, Believe it or not, I can actually probably handle it from here. Besides, you're going to need to get caught up on my life a little, if this story is going to make sense. [door closes] The guy in most of these pictures is my oldest brother Rich. He's kind of a local folk hero around here. That one right there is him winning all state wrestling in high school. And that one right there is his first day at Georgetown. Now Rich lives in the city, and you know he's really rich and is a lawyer And he's full of himself So go figure. Mom said, Rich getting into Georgetown was her proudest day ever. She never knew that he cheated on his entrance exam. That's her. She died a year later. That's Cubby as a kid Man, he was even big back then. That one there is my dad. And that one is my grandfather... umm, I mean the admiral as a young guy. Umm, wait. Maybe that one's dad and that one's grandpa. I can never tell them apart. Anyway, not to think, ya know that I'm not up here somewhere Oh yeah, there I am. Right there with my, co-third-place trophy for the Seymour Grammar School third grade science fair. Ah, I would've gotten fourth, but Billy Spicnardy had chickenpox, so I slipped in there for the glory. Don't you look all pretty. Did the Admiral want anything to eat? No sir, he's fine. Didn't ask you if he was fine. Yeah, didn't ask if he was fine. He's working on one of those crazy ships right now so I don't really think he's ready to join the real world. Pass the pepper. Here Pepper. You respect your grandfather. He served in the Navy for 37 years. Yeah, for 37 years. And people who live under this roof and have never even had a job, shouldn't talk. Yeah, don't talk. Shut up Cubby. You can't even see anything without dad saying it for you. Yes he can. Yes I can. Dammit Cubby, I just washed my face. What are you all dressed up for? Pepper's got a girlfriend. Sara back in town? Yeah, Sara is back in town. You better go or you're going to be late. What time is she coming, Cub? Dammit Cubby, what time? How is he supposed to know? Dammit, I got to go. For a kid with no job, he sure is busy. Did you finish that work on Mrs. Brown's station wagon? Ah, dammit Cubby, we got to go. [fast rock music] Hello Mrs. Johnson. How are you today? Fine Ethan.

It's American spirit. [laughing] Should I? Yeah. Well, it's the smell of the leaves on an autumn day. It's the new look of a new you. It's... American Spirit. Have you been memorizing the catalog ads again? I was about to say that you probably have a friend like Forbes around somewhere, but the more I think about it... You probably don't. Hey dude can you hand me that tape? Damn. This is classic. Ya know, I can't believe that more people didn't catch on to this. So ah, what brings you by?

We have been friends forever. You know and even though Forbes is kind of a weirdo, He is a good friend. So... If, ya know, I quit stalling, maybe we could find out when Sara is coming because that really is the point of the movie, isn't it? Dude. Your spacing. Yeah, um. So... Sara... Sara who? You know. Sara. Hmm, let's see. Sara Sara... Sara .. Ooooh. Did you mean the Sara who was like was the goddess among mortals? Did you mean your older, more handsome brother's pride and joy?

I gotta tell you Pepper I've seen the world and it's a lot bigger and better place than this little town. I ran with the bulls. I climbed the mountains. Pep, I even swam in a lake naked. You believe that one? Naked. Actually yeah, I could believe that one. Yeah if there’s anyone who's ever understood me it’s you Pep. It's unbelievable that I am here, huh? Isn't it unbelievable? Yeah, I was just thinking the same thing. You hungry? What? All right. Tell me what just happened? I didn't expect to hear birds singing, or or sparks flying... But this did not go as well as I expected. You got any money, Pep? What? Just didn't go as well as expected. That's all I'm saying. I know, you've only said that 12 times. So what happened? Hey Pepper. Fonzie. What'll it be? You know Emma, you're a funny person. Yeah, funny looking. You used that last time. Did I?

It didn't come up. Man, you've got a tell her. I mean, she probably already knows. It's not like you're too obvious. I'm not obvious. [laughs] Hey Emma, would you be surprised if I told you that Pepper here has a crush on beauty queen Sara? That girl? She's so beautiful that I've got a crush on her. See? All I'm saying is things didn't go as expected. OK? She's different now. Different? What's that supposed to mean? Did she come back with some horrible scar or glass eye or something? Not different like that. Well what then? She's just... You'll see when she gets here. She's coming by? Yeah. She wants me to help her clean up her aunt's old place. She's going to be staying their while she's back in town. You've got a date? It's not a date. Beautiful woman, eligible bachelor... It's not a date. Big 'ol empty house. It's not a date. If that's not a date I don't know what is. Don't you ever listen Forbes? It's not a date. Well, things haven't changed that much since I've been gone, the only kind of dates you know are the ones you rent from the girly section at Sam's Video. Better pick that jaw up off the ground Forbes. Somebody could trip over that. Hey Emma! You still working in this dump? Well, yeah. Yeah, well it's good to see you too. All right folks. Show's over. Come on, let's go. Umm, Sara. Umm.. Shhh... You talk too much. The... Back at the diner... that was kind of weird back there. Shhhh... Yeah, I guess so. Can I ask you something? You know, we really shouldn't stand out here all day. What are you waiting for? [Pepper] Wow, I can't remember the last time I was in this place. [Sara] I can. I can't believe you kept all of your aunt's old stuff. [slow rock] You know, we could call the Salvation Army. Like this one? That's a good one. Hey Sara, can I.. can I ask you something? Yeah, what is it Pepper? Well, umm... What I mean is umm... I... I just like the clothes. OK? Ugh! I mean, I don't have to look like that anymore, Pepper. Fuck 'em! They all can just shove it up their ass for all I care. That wasn't what I - that wasn't the question I was going to ask you. I mean... I think you look nice. You all - you always look nice. So... Thanks. Sara, are you a lesbian? [laughs] Geez Pep! You need to get out more, I'm serious. Well you do have that butch haircut. Fuck you. Oh, and Sara, no one says shove it up your ass, anymore. Really? I just thought, you know, maybe you'd like to know that, since a .. You know... you're no longer the coolest chick in town. Oh. Well thank you Pepper... I'll keep that in mind the next time I decide to cuss out this little piece of shit town. They do say piece of shit. Don't they? Oh yeah. They still say that. You know Pepper. You're a good kid. [crickets chirping] Hey, check these out. So? So? Don't you remember? Aunty had these awful things scattered all over the lawn. I can't believe somebody actually packed them. You like garden gnomes? [laughing] Hell no. I hate them. I hated these things since... Well, since I've lived in this house. Wow. That's a lot of hate. [softly] Yeah... She guarded these things with her life. I always wondered what it would be like to just crush one. So why don't you? What? Here. Give me this one right here. [Sara laughing] That was kind of wimpy. All right. Go ahead. Be my guest. You grab them by the head, you get the best grip. [laughing] Now that was wimpy. [glass breaking] [giggling] This time, I'm going to do it my way.

Look, all I'm saying is maybe it'll be fun to take dates, you know, this year. She was from Sweden. Wasn't there like a language gap? Not when you speak the language of love. Ahh oh yes, the language of love. Well, there's only one thing I have to say to that. Yeah? What's that? Yee haw cowboy. Oh right. You're making fun of the hat. No. The hat and the boots. Oh.

WHAT? You have a nice day now, ya hear. Yeah thanks. Jerk The word on the street? What street? We live on the same street you dork. Look, she's probably a lesbian anyway. Forbes.

You should've seen her. She just walked in there and she acted like she was Gandhi or something. Yeah, well. The haircut is kind of reminiscent. Shut up man. Look at you. What are you talking about? What are you a video mailman or something? Oh that's funny. You know I could go postal on you any minute. Look, all I'm saying is I think she is doing OK. Even with the commando gear? It's not always about looks, Forbes. You should understand that. Jesus Pepper. You're starting to sound like some kind of after school special. All I'm saying is I think she's fine Yeah well. Whatever you say. I mean she's just a chick. It's not worth getting all worked up over. Besides. What did we always used to say, huh? That's right. We'd never let a woman come between us. Right? You used to say that Forbes. Yeah well. You never used to disagree. Well, um. I'm not disagreeing. But I... [front door opens] [sexy music] I take it back man. She is fine. [tiger roar] Cut it out.

I'm not going back. Who cares what they think. Right Pep? Yeah. That's right Pep. Fuck 'em. That's not what I said Yeah, but you should have. Ok. Fuck 'em. I'm impressed. Yeah well, I'm impressed with the way you handled the admiral. Nobody goes in his room and comes out alive. Pepper your grandfather just needs a little attention. That's all. I mean you should really listen to what he has to say. He's quite an intelligent man. Yeah right. No seriously Pepper. He's got a lot to say. What like, shut up stupid or bring me my food. Well, if you hate him so much why do you do so much for him? I don't know. He's my grandpa, I guess. And I bet you walk little old ladies across the street, too. No. You're the last true Boy Scout Pepper. Yeah, so what's wrong with that. Nothing. I always could make you smile, huh? Yeah you could. So how's Rich? What? Rich. Have you seen him? How did this happen? Dammit. Not Rich now. Fine. I don't know. The same, I guess. Pepper, everybody changes. Not everyone. Hey, wanna get out of here? We didn't even order anything yet. I'll make us a real meal. Come on. Fuck 'em. [happy upbeat music] Um, wait here and I'll be back. [woman in car] Get out of here you asshole. [yelling] I'm home. I said I'm home. [next door voice] yeah we heard you. Now shut up before we call the police. [dog barking] Hey Shhhh... Do you hear that? What. I don't hear anything. Exactly. And do you smell that? Just someone burning their leaves. Pepper. I can't tell you how many times I woke up so very far away from here and all I wanted to do what's hear that beautiful silence and smell... that smell. Pepper. I can't tell you how many times I woke up so very far away from here and all I wanted to do what's hear that beautiful silence and smell... that smell. Isn't this perfect? What? Isn't this... Umm I didn't just dream that, did I? No Pepper. That was no dream. Yeah, so you see, I... I panicked. I mean. What would you have done? Am I crazy? Yeah, I didn't think so either. What would you do? Should I, should I tell her my feelings? Yeah. You're right, that's not a good idea. Thanks for the advice. [Forbes] Look, we need to [crash sound] Look. We need to talk. OK. I'm all for you and Sara getting together, right? But I've just got one question. What's that? Have you really thought this thing through? I mean, love can get messy. Yeah, who's been talking to you? Did you say something? No. Nothing. Look, do we have to talk about this now? Look, you've got to decide what your priorities are in life. What my priorities are? Who are you my dad? What did we say when we were seven? Oh, this is silly. Oh come on, what did we say? We would never let a girl come between us. Why? Because we were spit brothers. Super slimy extra chewy stinky spit brothers. Anyway that was when we were seven, you know. It doesn't matter. The principle still applies. Well, it's too late. I fucked it up. Do tell. Well don't sound excited or anything. I kissed her. And? I messed up. I panicked and I left. Why? Hello dick weeds. [finger nails on chalk board] [siren] Hey Pepper. I got your toy. Shut up Rich. Shut up Pepper Shut up Rich. No you shut up. No you shut up. No you shut up. No you. Boys. Pepper. Oh I'm sorry, am I interrupting something here? Well. If it isn't the dynamic duo of losers. Well it's nice to see you too, Rich. Yeah, I guess it is. What's up Pepper spray? How's things? Good. Hey Rich, that's a nice suit. Yeah. It's Italian. You know it's Saturday right? I mean, You do on other clothes or is that tree so far up your... Hey. You want success, you've got a dress for success. You gotta always stay focused on your goals. You've got to let nothing stand in your way. [cell phone rings] Why do I waste my time on you clowns anyway. I have no idea. Look, I got to take this. Just give me something from the top 10, all right? Yeah, Rich here. All right. I'll talk to you later babe. Don't forget your bag sir. Yeah. And uh. Put this on your tab, huh Pep? Later. [both] what an asshole. [both] you can say that again. [Pepper thinking] Ok this could start to get annoying really fast. Ok this could start to get annoying really fast. That's just what I was thinking. Don't they have videos in the city anyway? Not ones that you can get for free. Look, I got to get going. Go? I mean, did you hear what the man said? We are back. We're back. The dynamic duo is back. What? What are you talking about? We never left. Look, I've gotta find out why Rich is in town. Rich? Who cares? I've gotta keep him away from seeing Sara. See now that's exactly the kind of talk that keeps me from liking this situation. [Pepper] Don't worry. [sighing whisper] Don't worry. [car unlocking beep] [Sara] Worry about what? [Pepper] What? uh, I mean, what? [man in car] It's Rich. [Sara] you're not trying to avoid me now, are you? Me? No. You left so fast the other day, that you forgot this letter. I thought it was for me so I read it. You did? Remember when I said that the moment was perfect? Yep. Uh huh. Yeah bring her too. Bring it on. Right before you kissed me? I did? I mean... um. Yeah. What was the question? Well, this letter... Pepper. This letter is perfection. There's so much passion here. She's quite a lucky girl. [Pepper] Who? [Sara] the girl that you wrote this for. Oh yeah, her. Uh, I gotta go [Sara] Well, don't let me keep you. [Pepper] Okay. Oh Pepper. Yeah? There's just one more thing. Oh holy horse shit. Hey Sara. Yeah? This is pretty cool. Yeah. Hey Pepper... Why do you have to verbalize everything? I mean, just enjoy the moment. Right. Hey Sara. What? I've got something important I gotta tell ya. It's serious. I've been thinking about it a lot. It's about, you and I... and... Where are you going? I've got to go. What? We just got here. Was it something I said? Pepper, you've known me long enough. I thought you cared. But we were getting so close. [Pepper thinking] it was then that I realized that everyone Sara had loved her parents and her aunt, had left her. Good thing I didn't tell her that I loved her. [loud rock music] [car screeches to a stop] [music stops] [car lock beeps] [toilet flushes] [TV plays in background] You've been holding out on me. You little punk. No! What are you talking about? Sara has been back in town for like a month and you don't tell me? I just saw you last week. What did you think I wouldn't find out? No, it's just that... Sara is a little different now. And I thought... maybe... Maybe what? Ahhh... You still have a crush on your big brothers girlfriend? Don't you? You little geek. No. I was just thinking about Barbara. Barbara? Yeah, you know? Your current girlfriend? Oh... right. Just don't let it happen again. Oh... Rich... Hey Barbara, it's Rich. Yeah... hell yeah. Rich. Wait. What? Well I just wanted to let you know that... Sara and I are a lot closer now. [Rich on phone] Uh huh... OK that's it All right. I just want to let you know. [Rich on phone] all right OK. Uh huh... Yeah, yeah. It's just my kid brother. What did he say? Hell if I know. I wasn't listening. So baby, you gonna be around Friday, or what? Oh, you know I'm ready. Uh huh... [store background music] Excuse me, man. What do you think this means? Am I gonna lose her? I can't lose her. I don't even have her. Maybe I'm just over reacting. I mean... Rich is an asshole... I'm a nice guy, but... I just... I mean, I can't compete with their history. Maybe I'm just crazy. I mean... he... he might not... you know... He might not even see her. Hello? Excuse me. This whole thing could just... Blow over. [Customer] Excuse me. Should I do something? Here. Some guy dropped those off last week. He said something about putting them in the window.

So that I'll be outside and that there'd be instruments drowning out my voice. [crowd person]. Geek! Hey, Nice jacket! Well you know, um, I just got back from Los Angeles [crowd] go back to LA And the differences between high school dances over there and here are crazy. Cause when you dance with one person...

No. You've been trying to figure things out for a whole year. What about us? Look, Pepper... You're a great kid. No! I'm not. I'm not a great kid. You can't just brush me off like that. I won't let you. Well, maybe you don't have a say in this pepper. No Sara. There's one thing I've learned it's that, I have to give my say. Maybe it won't help anything or change anything, but I got to tell you this... Please, OK, God if you care about me in anyway, you won't. But I do Sara. I care about you. I love you. I've loved you since like the first time I laid eyes on you. Pepper enough. All right? It's too much. But Sara God pepper. You don't know me as well as you think you do. Oh yeah. Well, if I don't know you well enough then answer me this? Why did you leave? I don't know. Then why did you come back? I don't know. Then why did you send me postcards. Pepper I don't know. No Sara. You do. You do know. You may not want to face it, but when you do you need someone to listen. Maybe then, I won't be ready to talk.

You don't do that to a friend That's just mean. You known I've like loved her forever. Is that what you thought I was doing? Just trying to hurt you? Well, it looks like that from where I'm sitting. I did it because... I did it because... Because what? I did it because... I thought I was gonna lose you. All right? Lose me? Look, I'm going to tell you something that I have never told anyone. I'm not very good with women. [laughter] Oh really? No. Serious. Well, what does that have to do with Sara and me? You're going to think I'm a dork, but... You and me we're the dynamic duo. We always have been. With Sara around all the time... I don't know. You do the math. Look Forbes, if you ever pull a stupid ass stunt like you did today I am going to consider not being your friend. But up until then, nothing is going to change. OK? I mean, we've been friends since what, like when we were seven Six. See? Oh, and Forbes. Yeah? You are a dork. Yeah We good? Yeah, we're good.

Well fear not my good man for we know her modus operandi. Her what? She takes the train man. Right.
