You don't have to hold just on me, you know. I'm not even in character. Just catch the atmosphere, get the feeling. Feel the place. God, Mary. Get that tree, that's good. That? Yeah, just get the tree. Why? You got it? Because we have to film everything. I need atmosphere, all right? I gotta get the setting. It's a desert. For God's sake. Feels hot. Wait until you see it. You are going to be amazed. ♪ We're gonna have a little party ♪ And we got some special people comin' ♪ Ready? Behold the gates. Oh, my God, it's a dump. What the hell are you talkin' about? It's a hell of a lot better than last time. Look, it's isolated, we got room for everybody, it is perfect. Welcome home. Mary? Mary? What did we do wrong last time? If you'll recall, somebody got a little antsy and lost control. So this time let's streamline the plot. No fuckin' around, no losing control. Let's keep it simple. Nobody gets antsy and nobody gets away. Here, one box, then we'll be ready to start. Okay, get the camera ready. All right. Okay, you ready? All right, frame me up. Okay. So, this is our church set. Crude, but simplistic. I've always been an admirer of the Spartan approach. Clothes make the man. No seams on the sides, bigger shoulder line. Short sleeves make me look taller, right? Nice? Beautiful? Yeah. Uh... A few quasi-religious props. You need a central focus. Pull their eyes here. Humans are so easily distracted. Keep your eye on the birdie, right? Didn't see that comin', did you? You can't just dress like Superman and expect to fuckin' fly, can you, huh? No, you can't. You must have movement, dynamic movement. Spread your arms wide. Kneel. Eyes straight ahead. Dynamic finger movement, always slightly curled. You see? The voice that I'm using right now is clearly designed to make you, against all of your better judgment like me. But you drop down the tone, just ever so slightly. We face you. We speak to you with a slightly halting cadence. Questioning, searching eyes. A quietly discomforting, although caring, effect can be achieved. Do you see? Well then we get deep down in fuck-you-in-the-ass territory. And that's a place I like to be, baby. So here it is. This is our playroom. Let's play. Looks like I'm heading to Mexico. I wanna share something with you. This is the last thing I got from my sister before she disappeared. "Dear El," "I wish you could be here with me." "Every day is a perfect experience." "Father Simon has shown me what a beautiful person I really am." "I know you won't understand this, but it's what I needed." "I feel like I am finally home." "Love, Janet." That is not my sister. I'm now about 200 Ks south of the U.S. border. They said they'd meet me here at noon. Hey. Are you Ellen? Yeah. I'm Mary. Hop in. Guys, this is Ellen. Hey. Hey. Hi. Hey. It's hot out there. Where are you from? London. Oh. Like fish and chips and stuff? I've never left the state before. Well, you're a long way from home now. Yeah. Long way from home. Bye, home. You must be Ellen. Welcome. It's good to be here. Hi, my name is Simon Leach. I'm 42 years old. I'm from Alabama. And I love my new life in his service. My life was a mess when he found me. I was just another lost soul looking for meaning in the emptiness. I drank and I drugged. Slept with wayward women, lost myself in all kinds of sinful distractions. And then one day, in a moment of deep personal darkness, he found me. I had blood on my hands, hate in my heart, but he didn't judge me. He set my spirit free that day. I promised him I'd do anything I could to repay him. Well, I finally arrived at the compound. Looks like this is gonna be my new room. Not quite sure who my roommate is yet though. Hey, Mary. Give me a little smile. That's my sunshine girl. - Shit! - Hey. Sorry. What's with the camera? You settling in okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Need anything? No, I'm good. You have a really pretty face. You look good on camera. Thanks. Hey, we're glad you're here. Thanks. They've locked me up in this room so I have time to reflect. Hold on. What is that? Shit. Let me give you a little lesson in costume design. Do you mind? Okay, go. Yeah. Is it okay? Yeah? Earth tones, they calm the brain. Neutrals. You'll always find priests and religious figures wearing neutral tones. Whites. Look at altars, you'll find soft neutral tones. Bright colors excite the mind and we don't want that. So we've got an array of neutral tones, of sands and whites. What do you think? Hold on. What do you think? Wait, this is kind of a western vibe here. It's very friendly. Hi, I'm Father Simon. I'm glad you're here. Tell me a little about yourself. What do you think? No. No? No. Fine. Okay. What do you think? What do you think? Nice? Yeah? Yeah. Hey, welcome. Where are you from? Tell me about your family. Who gives a fuck? No, but seriously, tell me about yourself. Yeah. Yeah, what do you think? Yeah. Yeah? Button-down? Try the last one. I don't like that color. Damn, woman. All right, what do you see? What do you like? Yeah, I like that one. Hi. Welcome. I wanna tell you that I care about you. Don't tell any of the other children this, but you're probably my favorite. I love you. I love you. This is the next in a series of entrance interviews with Sister Tracy. Entrance interview with Brother Alan. Brother Ben. Robin. Entrance interview, Brother Brian. Entrance interview, Brother Frank. Entrance interview, Sister Grace. Veronica. Welcome, Sister. Thank you, Father. We're glad you're here. I'm really glad to be here. The purpose of the interview is for you to let people know why you're here, how you came to be here, and how you feel about being here. Okay. Let me ask you something. Are you willing to be completely and totally honest with me? About everything? Yeah. 'Cause like, I didn't have... Because I didn't have anywhere else to go, I guess and I... Um... 'Cause everything else was really bad and I... Hey, Alan, what... What was bad? You say things were bad, everything was bad. What was bad? I don't know. You'd run away, hadn't you? You'd run away from home? Yes. Why? I couldn't live there anymore. Um... More physically... Did you have sex with him? I did. How old were you? Seventeen. How old was he? Forty-four. What is a man? What's a man to you? A man's strong and he's able to take care of himself and he's not a failure in life and... You think you're a failure? But as I got older, the drinking got worse and it became drinking and beating and fucking and drinking and beating and fucking, and drinking and beating and fucking, and drinking and beating and fucking. I didn't leave a family. I left a woman and a man living for themselves and wanting me to live for them as well. You need to be yourself. You need that. And I never got that. And that's what I want. I... I lost someone really close to me a while ago. I'm sorry. And I... I kind of pushed everyone away. As you can see, we don't have much. But I'll tell you what, we make do. And here's some of our children doing their laundry. Hey, Brother Ben. How are you? What do you got there? Got your laundry there? Looks good, nice and clean. All right, carry on, Brother. We have Sister Grace, Sister Ellen. Hi, Father Simon. Better be careful in there, you might get a tidal wave. Well, it's... It's really not what I expected. But this group of people, I don't think they'd hurt anyone. Simon is definitely a crook, but. I don't think he's murderous. Mary's creepy, though. Every time I'm around her, my skin crawls. I don't know. Why are we getting this again? 'Cause we need the happy stuff. Okay? Hey, guys. Hi, Father Simon. Father Simon. So we're gonna have a camera chat and we're gonna find out about what you're doing and tell everybody what we do here, Sister Veronica. With your sweet smile. And your nice dancing eyes. Are you Irish? Yeah, I am. You look like you got some Irish in you there. Why don't you tell the people what you're doing? We're sewing our caftans. To be ready for our transition. And each of the children got to choose their own pattern for the caftan. Right? Yeah? That's right. Yes. So I'm guessing yours is stylish? I don't know what it's gonna turn out like. It's not that good. It's gonna be great, yeah. Thank you, Father Simon. It's really great being here because everyone is really nice to me. Father Simon is... Just makes me feel at home and everyone else makes me feel like I'm part of a family. You are at home and you are part of the family. Thank you, my dear. So sweet. Seamstress Robin. Hard at work. She probably knows the size of needles to use. If I had a sewing machine for you, I bet you could just crank out all kinds of things. I wish. This is good, though. These needles are good for getting through the fabric. You probably wouldn't mind sewing everyone's caftan. Well, but then they wouldn't each be different. They'd all be the same. And that's just a little part of the lesson, preparing your own caftans because I prepared my own. We're family and each family member has a responsibility and we work together all for the common good. I am an idealist at heart and I'm still idealistic enough even at this age to believe that it's possible to work together for something good. You guys with me? Yes, Father Simon! Okay. Blessings on you, Sister. - Go, go, go, go, go! - All right, come on. Whoo! All the way home. All the way home. Nice. Go, go, go, go, go! Mary, Mary, Mary. I don't know what to say. It's fantastic. Where the hell did you get this? I like it, it's good. It's a bent candle, it's nice. Universal religious symbolism mixed with a little pagan shit. So the parrot turns to the magician on the raft and he says, "Okay, I give up. How'd you do the trick?" Is there love in this room? Yes, Father. Is there happiness in this room? Yes, Father. Is there trust in this room? Yes, Father. Take a step back. 'Cause sometimes we need to trust each other with a big thing. Not just a small thing. Yes? Yes, Father. And we send trust to you, Brother Frank. One, two, three! Hug your brothers and sisters! Yes. Yes. Other people... Other people... are shadows. Are shadows. We let the shadows go. We let the shadows go. Gently. Gently. Other people... Sister Ellen, the more of those lovely dishes you break the higher your points. You ready to try? Yeah? Do you know how to do this? Have you done this before? I'll bet they don't have this in London. In fact, I know they don't. - Here she goes. - Just do it. We've been learning about each other. There's someone here today who's feeling something they haven't felt before. I know it. I can feel it. Who is that someone? Who is that someone? Sister Ellen. Don't deny it, Sister. There's something changing in you. There's something changing inside you. Do you see it in her eyes? Do you see it, brothers and sisters? Yes, Father. Tell us. Tell us, share. Share. I don't know what to say. Don't hold back on us, dear, please. We've given you everything. I don't know, I guess, I don't know, I'm... I feel... I... I guess I feel like I am starting to believe in something again. I don't know. Yes. You look like you really know what you're doing. Uh... It's nothing. My dad was a contractor. He just taught me how to build. Yeah? Yeah. I bet you could fix just about anything. I could try. I don't know if I could fix everything. I think that maybe later there's something in my room that's broken maybe you could fix? Yeah, yeah. Yeah? Of course, Father Simon. That'd be great. Thanks. Of course. No problem. I can help you with anything. Thank you. All right. ♪ Amen! ♪ Amen! ♪ Amen! ♪ Amen! ♪ Amen! Amen! ♪ Amen! ♪ I like knitting and I made needles out of these spoons and I'm making each of you a scarf. Yeah! Sister Ellen, have you a talent? Have you a talent, my dear? Will you share it with us? Step to the front. All right. One more time. Mary... It's fine. Just go. How long do I have to do this? For a while. But it's so boring. It makes me look thoughtful. It's still boring. Be sure you get this. This looks good. Got it. And zoom out. Okay, you can go. Thank you. You know I did. How? You know. Yes, but they don't. Father Simon and I talked a whole lot online and he told me the best stories about his life and how good it would be if I joined him. So what'd you do? I came and found you. You're happy? I guess so. Do you like peaches? Yes. Yeah, me too. You can do it. You just gotta scrub harder. Harder. A little bit harder. See? And this is our chore wheel. Who would like to explain how the chore wheel works? To show everybody how it works? Veronica? Yeah, what happens chore wheel day? On chore wheel day, we just spin the wheel and whatever it lands on, that's our chore for the week. Veronica, guess what? You get to pick the first person to spin the wheel. Who do you pick? Um... Uh... I'll pick Ellen. Pump water. Brother Alan. Would you like to spin? What's your favorite? I like doing the laundry. Okay. Here we go. Bathroom. Who hasn't gone? Who have I missed? Who among the children have I missed? Grace! Get up, Amazing Grace! All right. All right, Grace. It always sticks. Okay. Who loves chore wheel day? All right, guys, on the count of three, we're all gonna get up we're gonna go do our chores and work hard because we're a family. Who loves you? Father Simon. I love my children. Do what the chore wheel told you! Let's go! Yeah. All right, let's go. Come on, hustle, hustle. - Tracy, I can catch. - There we go. - It's okay. I got it. - Good job there, T. Go get it. Keep going. Keep going. Run. I just wanna know your thoughts and impressions. Um... I guess everyone seems really nice. It's peaceful. It seems like you have a nice group of people around you. That's my first impression. Where's that picture from? The waterfall. Have you been out to the desert before? Yes. Yeah. Pretty out here. I love what I do. And I hope maybe in some small way it can be of some help, help you find whatever it is you're searching for. Anything you'd like to tell people who might be watching this about our little piece of paradise? Who's gonna be watching it? I think that's yours. How's it work? Um... You turn it on. Yeah? Can you zoom? Yeah, it's zoomed in. How's the mike on that thing? It's all right. I haven't used one before. Good memory? Record a lot of stuff? Not bad. That's handy. That's good. I need one. Here. No, that's yours. That's a thing that gives the lie to all the trust that we've been trying to build up here. Simon. Have I done anything to indicate or show you that I was trying to hurt you? Have I done anything to earn the distrust? I need to know... I need to know what happened to Janet. I need to know. I need to know why she died. You weren't truthful with me, but I'll be truthful with you. She died because of you. That's not true. We shared everything with each other. Did you? Did you know she tried to kill herself? You're lying. Right after her husband left and took the kids. No, she was depressed and we talked about it. She stopped drinking and she went to therapy. Now that I did know. That helped for a while. For a while. She was so lonely. Poor Janet. But that all changed the day she found our website. She told me that was the day she felt she was finally able to connect with someone, really connect. She confessed her sins. The next day she moved into our church. Would you like to know how she died? What happened? We were fine. Everything was fine until stories began to appear in the... Stories that were true. Lies. The same thing that always happens when people come across something they don't understand and they need an easy answer to explain it away. And when the lies came, the police came. That's what brought the police to our door. So why did you shoot at them? We didn't. They came in shooting. We tried to hide in the main room. They burned us out. She saved my life. She was proud of you. No, she wasn't. She always talked about you. Her beautiful sister. She was so proud of you. She was happy, Ellen. She was happy. Look, I'm sorry I made you cry, but now you understand why we tape everything around here. Because people don't understand, because people get the wrong ideas. And I'll be damned if I will let any one of my followers ever be hurt by anybody. I want people to know that we weren't monsters. I'm sorry I lied to you. In my hand I hold a recipe. It's a recipe for distrust. It's a recipe for fear. It's a recipe for hatred. You know what it is? What is it? It's love. "Simon, there's no love on the plate." "There's nothing but pens and papers. There's no love there." There will be. 'Cause we're each gonna take a slip of this paper and we're gonna write something about the person next to us. All right. Can everybody write? 'Cause I didn't ask that. You never know. Just wanna make sure, right? Which way do we go? This way or this way? I haven't decided that. Evan, if we will just wait for instructions, then we will find out the way things are done instead of jumping ahead. That's good, Father Simon. Here we are. I know it's good because I said it. All right. Everybody write something loving and affirming. I'm gonna join in, too. I will write about. Brother Brian. You will write about Brother Frank. Who will write about Sister Tracy. Who'll write about Sister Veronica who will write about Brother Ben, who will write about Sister Ellen who will write about Brother Alan. Time's almost up. All right. Let's begin. Brother. Read. Stand and read for us, would you? "Brother Brian sings like a bird. He also has nice eyes." It's true. Yes. Thank you, Father Simon. "Brother Frank is the most amazing kickball player." Stand up. "Sister Tracy has the sweetest smile. It lights up the whole place." How nice! "You are helpful and handy. I love your birdhouse." It's really pretty. "Brother Ben, you are so loving and kind, so considerate." "I love you." I love you, too. "You are so warm that when you finally came," "our family felt complete." Thank you. "Brother Alan has a beautiful smile." And there's a smiley face. "Brother Evan has nice eyes and doesn't judge me." There it is. Sister? Father Simon. "Father Simon," "the most powerful man who gives us strength and love." I wish it were true, but I'm not powerful at all. I'm a very weak man. But with love, all things are possible. And with love, we are strong. And with love, we are family. You know, when you came in, you didn't smile much and now you smile a lot. I know. I'm glad to see it. It's because of you, Father Simon. Thank you. No. Thank you. Have you ever thought about what you would say if you could say something to those who might be left behind when you leave the earth? Have you thought about it? Yes, Father. I guess everybody has. I guess it's just human. I know I have. And I think the great thing about our family is we have the opportunity to do it. Because we're going to a better place. It's hard. Because I've always been taught to keep my feelings in check. But I feel free with you. I've never been more welcomed into a group of strangers in my entire life. I was around people for over 20 years in my hometown that didn't give a damn whether I lived or died. I don't know that I've done right by this world and I think I could do better in the next. But I wanna please you. I'm scared, nervous. It's good, it's a good scared-nervous. It's not that hard, you just gotta have the balls to do it. I mean, if you think you're happy like with, with your family and like, working your job and like, going to school, you're wrong. You guys, you're all wrong. And this is the best ever. This family, this group, has taken me in and become my new family. I guess I don't really know what I'm looking for, but I hope I find it here. I hope so, too. And when I see my father and show him who I've become, I'm good now. I don't know what else to say. It's a surprise for someone. It's a surprise for someone. What's going on? It's a surprise for someone. What's going on? What's going on? Happy birthday! Yes! Each one of these candles represents someone in your life who's hurt you, someone who's let you down, someone who's been mean to you, someone outside of the family. With all of your might blow their lives away. All dead! Simon. Not now, Mary. So what's going on with you? Nothin'. No, everything's good. Now, just between you and me and the camera, is anything bothering you? You like being here? Yeah. Yeah, I love it. It's great. Yeah, I really... I really like it. You making friends? Yeah. All the kids? Yeah. Yeah. Friends with Grace and... Ellen? Yeah. Evan? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And then, I just went for it. You know, I just... What do you mean? What'd you do? Well, I kissed him. Yeah. And then I just leaned in and kissed him. Did he kiss you back? Hmm? Did he kiss you back? Now. I'm sorry! I'm sorry! Sorry! I'm sorry! Do we have to film this? Would it make you more comfortable if we turned the camera to the wall? If you wouldn't mind, Father? Now wait a minute. I find this hard to believe. You never had a boyfriend? I mean, I could be your boyfriend. That'd be creepy. Why? Because you're my father. You can't be both. What if I told you that I can do anything I want? Here we have two of my children in an intimate moment. What do you see in front of you? A girl. What's her name? Robin. What's her purpose? I don't know. Her purpose is to serve you, son, because you're a man. Do you hear me? Do you understand? Okay. And at this moment, you're looking at your property and your playground. A thing of beauty and delicacy. Put your hands on your property, son. Do it. Do it. Do it now. I don't know how. Okay. Is that the way you handle property? I don't know. Touch her. Higher. Higher. You know where to go. Do it. Touch 'em. Put your hand on the other one. Okay. I'm sorry. Good. Just feel. Robin, how does it feel? Don't lie. How does it feel? It doesn't feel like anything. I'm sorry. Because Alan doesn't yet know how to appreciate a woman. But he will. Kiss her. Kiss her, Alan. The other way, I can't see you. Kiss her. You're not kissing your goddamn grandmother, kiss her. Something's changed and everyone's acting scared, but they won't tell me what's what. I don't know, maybe they don't even know. Things just... They feel heavier. Simon and Mary keep disappearing for long hours at a time and when they get back, they run us through even crazier drills. It's getting harder to focus. They're not letting us sleep anymore. I wanna talk now. I'd like to talk about music. And the power that music has to change people. Some people. The song Amazing Grace, I've heard a million times. I heard it growing up in church. I was a pretty bad kid. I didn't listen to that stuff, you know? Then one day that song came up and it hit me square in the face. I was in County, again, trying to lower my points, you know. Bullshit motherfucking say-no-to-drugs meetings they had. God. Sweet Jesus, it was boring. You know the routine. Some fat motherfucker gets up starts talking about how doing blow made him suck dick. Whatever. I don't give a shit. Then he starts talkin' about that song. About how it changed him, you know. He was blind but now he sees. You know, blah, blah, blah, I'm about half-listening. Then he starts to sing. ♪ Amazing Grace ♪ How sweet the sound ♪ He sung like an angel. Just like an angel. So I figured. "Hell," "if Amazing Grace could make that fat fuck beautiful," "maybe it can do something for the likes of me." We were six when we first met. She was my best friend. I think we knew even back then we were gonna get married. She got pregnant. We were only 17. But... we weren't worried. We knew we'd make it work. She died. What happened? The baby cut off her blood supply. What about the baby? Why would anyone blame you? It's my fault she got pregnant. And were they right? Was it your fault? You think it was lust or love? It was love. You sure you know the difference? Yes, Father. What are you afraid of? Most? Most of all? Don't lie. That I won't get to see her again. Good. Let's talk about Mama. Mama didn't give a shit about me. Or what happened to me. So I got in trouble real early and real often, you know. Petty theft, stole some cars, shit like that. And I got caught a lot. She didn't do shit to get me outta there. So I stayed. And I didn't care. At least in there the hot water worked. You know, I got something to eat. God, you see some things, though. Back up, baby, let me show you something. The first time I saw a man take another man's life, he stabbed him in the eyeball for an orange. A fuckin' orange. I mean, fuck! You don't getnothing for free in life. There's always somebody who wants to get fucked or fuck you. That's the only thing she ever did say that made any sense. I wonder what she'd think of me now. Fuck you, Mama! Fuck you! Turn it off. Just being in this world? I'm here to tell you it doesn't have to be that way. You can call it what you will, I call it a transition. But it's a change, brothers and sisters. It's a change. And it's a hard way and I can't make you choose it. And if there's anyone in this room right now if there's anyone under the sound of my voice who feels that this way is not for them, I wish, I beg, I plead for them to stand up and walk out that door. And I swear to you upon my honor as a man that you will not be stopped. I will turn my back and I will wait. If you must leave, leave. Very well. Who's ready to feel that moment? I am ready, Father. I'm ready. Who's ready to feel that power? I'm ready, Father. Brother Evan. Yes? He tells me it is your time. Oh, my God. Thank you, Father. Celebrate with your brother. I love you! I love you! Exit interview, Brother Evan. Hi. Hi, Brother. This is a great opportunity for you to tell those who may watch this in the future what you're feeling, what you'd like them to know. This is it. This is the only holy place on earth. I feel sad for you because you will never experience what we are experiencing. We only live once. We only have one shot. And this is it. Yes, Father. This is a moment of joy for all of the family. We will soon be reunited in our new home. Give me the camera. Now, now. Perfect. Absolutely perfect. Yesterday you saw Brother Evan transition. Yeah. What was that like? I don't know. Yesterday, I got to witness the most beautiful thing I have ever seen in my entire life. I was really happy. I knew that Brother Evan was in a better place, a place I wanted to be in. Who's this guy? The truck? Yeah. Yeah. You like trucks? Yeah, I do. I've always liked trucks. Yeah. Yeah, they're strong. Do you want to talk about Brother Evan's transition? Why don't you just tell us what it was like? I don't know why, I felt confused. Confused about what? I didn't want him to be in pain. Don't you find that hard to watch? If it troubles you, why didn't you stop it? I've asked myself that and I don't know why. Should I have stopped it? I don't know what I'm doing here anymore. He was right. She was alone. And I was too busy all the time. I didn't listen to her. Not at all. She would try and tell me things and I know it's too late for her, but... I decided to stay and help Leach. If he made her feel better, maybe he'll do the same for me. Come. I'm ready. You sure? Yes, Father. I wanna feel what she felt. You're unhappy, aren't you? This is a special night, my children. Yes, Father. Our last member has expelled the fear in her heart and she shall join us. Yes, Father. Are you ready to join us? Yes, Father. Can I share a story with you? So I'm 18 years old, right? And I get a girl pregnant. And it's complicated by the fact that we're in love. And her mama didn't like it, and my mama didn't like it so we were cast out on our own, you know. I took a job at the burger joint, mowed lawns on the weekends. A few months go by, she goes into labor and she loses the baby. And I lose her. They had to cut her open and bled too much. There was nothing they could do, you know. It was over real quick. So what do you do when the worst thing, the worst thing you can possibly imagine, actually happens? What do you do? We're always going through life and we're just getting by. And doing what they're told to do, but you don't have to do that. You can do what you want and you can be happy. Is everyone ready for our next transition? Yes, Father. Brother Frank. Hi, Father. Mary, if you would. Brother Frank... Yes, Father. You've done all that you can so far. You've purged the poison from your soul. He knows that you're here to serve him. He doesn't want to lose you to the other side. He knows the pain that you've suffered. It's time to take the first step toward forgiveness. Are you ready for your moment of revelation? Yes, Father. My brother, go in peace. I love you, Father. Mary, the lights. I love you, my son. I love you, Father. Children, set him free. Our father, thou art in Heaven. We will honor and remember your moment of revelation. We will honor and remember your moment of revelation. We will honor and remember your moment of revelation. Now who will be next to make the transition? Draw well, my brothers and sisters. What an honor it would be. Brother Ben. Yes? Brother Alan. Sister Robin. She's next. Why are you crying on your day of joy? I'm sorry. I believed in you. I believed in you when no one else would. I'm just scared. And all that I've asked in return is that you have a little faith in me. Sister Robin has pierced my soul. Is there not one who has faith? Is there not one who has faith in me? Sister? Father. I have faith. Lovest thou me? Do you love me? I love you, Father. Do you love me more than this one? Yes. Do you love me more than her? Yes. I shall show you faith. I shall show you faith and you shall see. I don't fucking care! I said, on your knees! Get down on your fucking knees! And you fucking stay there! You understand me? Do you understand me? I don't care what you fucking thought. Get up! Get up! Open the fucking gate! Get the fuck out of here! Run, bitch! Stay there! Robin wasn't worthy of her moment. She lost her transition to the outside world. When I was a kid, I found this puppy. But my timing was off. See, Mama was bad to drink, she wasn't studying no puppy that day. Mama was studying teaching me how to tie my shoes. I'd been trying it maybe six months, but I couldn't get it. No matter how I tried, I couldn't get it. She took Phil and she hung him outside the window. She told me I had 30 seconds. I tried. God, I tried. His head cracked open like an egg. Whose fault was it? It was mine. 'Cause I wasn't strong enough to keep him safe. Are you fucking kidding me? Mary! Mary! You said they were all under control! That son of a bitch is gonna go to the police and you know it. It's comin'. I'll get them in the big room. I'm finally happy for the first time. For the first time, I feel like. I'm finally home. You know what I wanna be remembered as? As someone who finally said what they thought. Like, I feel... It's warm and it's... It's so wonderful. Do you trust me more than your blood family? Yes, Father. Have you thought about your own moment? I just... I just think about the better place and I trust the transition to you. I wanna feel that pain. I want it to happen now. Dear God, could you be more perfect? I know you won't understand. I know what you'll think. I want you to know I love you. I want you to know it's not your fault. But you never could have made me as happy as I am now. Because of me, because of who I am. And I'll always think of you. Perfection. I'm nervous, but in a good way. Like Christmas. Are you afraid? No. Do you have any last words? I just wanna thank you for all you taught me. Because of you, I'm now clear and free. I don't feel alone anymore. And I don't fear death. I want everyone that follows me to know that I feel your love inside. I'm joining my new family now. My new home. We'll all be waiting for you. You love me? Yes. Will you always love me? Yes. Are shadows. Are shadows. We let the shadows go. We let the shadows go. Gently. Gently. Classic cast. Perfect number to begin with. Just like you're sayin', baby, not too many, not too few. 'Cause they gotta be able to be close enough to smell each other's fear and feel each other come. I love it when you say that. We got Frank. Now, he's a lamb to the slaughter. Nobody knows what's happenin'. Audience don't know what to trust. Bam! Brian. Ben. ♪ Amen! ♪ I mean, they're nice enough but nobody really gives a shit if they live or die, right? Then we get to the real meat. Alan and Evan, my star-crossed lovers. We have Grace, my space cadet, looking for the moon. Get in here. Shoot it, shoot it. Ready? Ready? You ready? Let's go. Let's go, huh? I'm gonna go again. Hold that, hold that, hold that. We have Robin, my wallflower, waiting for Prince Charming. We have Veronica, my redhead. She's thrown in just to spice things up. We have Ellen. That Ellen may be the girl of my dreams. Are you ready to transition? Yes, Father. Are you afraid? No, Father. Let her have the gun. What? Give it to her. Why? Let her do it herself. Mary! Now do as we said. Good girl. Good girl. What now? Just like Janet. I love you, Father. Look, it's real simple. Here's the zoom. In. Zoom out is right there. Here's your focus. You see? Just keep it on auto focus. A lot easier. Frame me up here. Don't get my profile, okay? Just always three-quarters. Right, don't zoom in unless I tell you to. No profiles, you keep that in mind, we're gonna be fine, all right? Don't worry, you'll get the hang of it. You're gonna be fine. I trust you.
