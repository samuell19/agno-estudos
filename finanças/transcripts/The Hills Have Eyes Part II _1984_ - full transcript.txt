'Bobby! 'Bobby! 'Kill him, Bobby! Kill him! 'Kill him!' 'Why are you doing this?' 'Bobby, don't leave me!' 'Why are you doing this? 'What do you want? 'I'll eat the brains of your kids' kids! 'I'll eat the brains of your kids' kids! 'I'll eat the brains of your kids' kids!' - 'Why are you doing this?' - 'Bobby, don't leave me!' - 'Bobby, don't leave me!' - 'Why are you doing this?' 'Don't leave me!' Then what happened? Bobby come on. Don't hang on it. Just get it out. You can't sit on this for the rest of your life. It was the last chance we had. They'd already killed my mother, and my older sister, they'd kidnapped the baby. And now the father... he was coming after us. My sister and I knew that we would die just like the others. Unless we used our mother's body as bait to trap him. Do it! Aargh! Shit! Aargh! He's alive! Hold your nose. Hold your nose! Get back there like I told you! Aargh! I'll get you! - Go on. Run! - I'll get you! Come on, open the door. Bobby don't leave me! Don't leave me! Bobby, don't leave me! Don't leave me! Bobby, Wait! Kill him! Kill him, Bobby! Bobby, don't go in there! And so he's dead, right? I guess. - We just left him there. - You know he's dead. You killed him. You blew him to shit. Your sister axed him, you shot him. Now, what does it take to convince you? You didn't see that guy. How tough he was. He was a stupid psychopath. You were able to trick him and kill him. And you did. They all were. They were all beatable and you did it. You know it. Look, it's alright for you to go to these races, Bobby, and it makes perfectly good business sense too. Right? Right. Good. This new formula gas of yours is gonna be a big push to your career. If you let the professionals see it, right? Right. I just keep having this urge to call up my team and tell them the desert's too dangerous, we shouldn't go out there. Bobby, go thumb your nose at the desert. Alright? The boogeyman's dead, and as for your racing team, I think those kids can take care of themselves. Don't worry about it. 'It's now 6:12 AM.' You gotta be kidding. This early? - Gotcha! Ha-ha! - Cass, what are you doing? Shh! You'll wake my father. Better say your prayers, hotshot. What is this? I was gonna scare you, since you always feel my face first. - Didn't work. - No? - You're early. - Yeah, I know. I knew you'd never be ready, unless I dug you out. And I brought you something. - Thanks, Roy. - Uh-hmm. - So, Roy... - Hmm? Why are you wearing so many clothes? It's cold out on the bike this early. I said, why are you wearing so many clothes? Well... Listen, we're gonna be late. We gotta be there in half an hour. - Then we better hurry. - Yeah? Hey! There ain't no foreign bikes allowed here. - Just Yamahas right? - Just Yamahas. Give me some room, Cass. Excuse me just a second. We're gonna get this taken care of right now! Hulk, put me down, damn it! - Had enough? - I'm getting dizzy! Now, now! - Can I have a sip of your soda, Hulk? - Yeah. Hey... how did she know I had a cola? She probably heard the bubbles. Keep your finger over the hole next time. - Ho, ho! My man, Roy! - Foster! - How you doing, Cass? - Pretty good. Been to the beach this weekend? You got a great tan. Yuck, yuck. I love his white bread sense of humor. Hey, she looks great! - Is she ready to race? - Oh, yeah. - How about you? - Hey, I'm always ready. - I'll vouch for that. - Whoo! Hey, you got the gas tanks split. What the hell? One side's for the best fuel the competition's got, and the other's for Bobby's formula 2 super racing fuel. Oh, in the middle of the race, I kick in Bobby's super formula 2. And you pull away so fast, the other guys get off their bikes to see why they're suddenly standing still. Ha-ha! I like it. I like it! - Nothing like having an ace in the hole. - Right. We got 50 gallons here. We're gonna pass them out as samples. Bobby's gonna make a million dollars. And then, we're gonna sell this formula to one of the big gas companies. - Am I right? - Alright. And we can just kick back and race the rest of our lives. - Now that's bad! - Bad? Bad, for sure. - Anybody seen Harry? - Uh-oh... I think I hear him. - Cass... - Oh, man, here we go. You sure called it. Yee-haw! - Primo entrance. - Is he dead? - Could be arranged. - Did you see that? Vroom! I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I bet the girls I could beat 'em here. - I did too! - Whoo! You cheated, Harry! You out through that other guy's yard! Yeah, so what? Boy, I feel like I've just fallen down three flights of stairs in a trash can. - Hey, Sue. How are you? - Hey, babe. Hi, Rachel. How are you? - Hi, Rachel. - Hi, kids. - Is Bobby ready to hit the desert? - Roy, can I see you a second, please? - What's up? - Bobby's not feeling so hot today. I've never seen it this bad. I come back for you later, girly. It's OK, baby doll. Hey, Bobby, you OK? Sure. Look, I can't make it today. I cannot go out in the desert. - Maybe none of you should go today. - Wait, that's just not gonna do. Not after all your work. Not after Rachel and Foster's problems on the new gas. Hey, we'll do it ourselves, then. No sweat. I'll go, Bobby. I know the way and I can take care of the business for both of us. - Sure? - I'm sure. I thought I could make it today. God damn. If it wasn't so close to that other place. It's gonna be alright. It's gonna be alright. - This is it. - This is where? This is where we're gonna get our entrance fee. Hi, Mrs. Wilson. How'd it go? Ah! Extremely well, extremely well. Oh, he's quite a specimen. Quite a specimen! - He has a mind of his own too. - Yeah. - Well, here we go. - Thank you. Fantastic. - Where's that old gigolo? - Oh, please, don't you call him. I'll get him. Four hundred smackers, boys and girls! - For what? - The Beast! - Way to go, Beast! - Hey, Beast! Don't call him! Don't whistle! Beast! - Come on, Beast! - Yeah! See you next time, Mrs. Wilson! There's a legend around these here parts. It ain't no pretty tale. But it's supposed to be true. Oh, no, Uncle Harry, don't scare us with your stories! Sorry, children, but we are approaching the part of the desert where the family of Jupiter held sway. Where the sand ran with fire and blood, and the hills had eyes. Watch the road, Harry. Why, Cass? You see something I don't? Ha-ha. You mean that story about that wild family nobody knew about? Oh, yeah, the ones who lived on the bomb range and ate anyone who came through. - I'd eat any girl that came through. - You dork! They had some weird names. I'll tell 'em to ya. You see, the father was Jupiter, and two killer brothers named Pluto and, er... Mars, I think. - Wasn't there a daughter too? - Yes. Yeah, there was a daughter. Yeah, she killed her brother to save the tourists. I forgot about her. - Who are you? - Why don't you give me my kid? Your baby! - Let's get out of here! - Oh, God... Take the baby and hide. Hide! Mars! She was some kinda maniac too. Think her name was Ruby, right? Ruby, right. Good. Wonder where she is today. Maybe she opened a boutique in Tarzana. Oh, God. Can you believe that? - Wait a second. - What's wrong? Am I crazy or are you breathing like you're scared or something? I'm fine. - Do you want one? - What? A cigarette, Cass. Sorry, for a moment I forgot you were... A non-smoker? Right. You're not feeling psychic today, are you? You know like you sometimes do? No. If I was, I wouldn't have come. Not after the way Bobby was... Well, you know. Slowly, the dying prospector crawled across the desert floor. Tongue black and swollen. Fingers all ripped to pieces from the cactus. You know, our late start might've done us in. If we don't make registration by 11:00, we just might as well forget it. Hey, we'll make it. No sweat, boss. With a half hour to spare. - Oh, shit! - What, Foster? "Don't forget to set your clocks ahead one hour, "and don't be among those who are late for work Monday." Because today ends Daylight Savings Time. I can't believe it. None of us remembered that. Alright, this is where we are, and this is where the races are. - He's right over here, Cass. - We'll never make it. It's like this great big circle we have to make. We're gonna lose by default. Unless we use Harry's maneuver. - Harry's maneuver? - Shortcut! - We're not getting off this road. - Shortcut, shortcut, shortcut! Look, Rachel. There's a road right here cuts straight across. It'll save us more than an hour. Guaranteed. Come on, Rachel. We came this far. Please. Don't dump our chances now. OK. We'll put it to a vote. - I say we turn back. - Cass! Look, I didn't build this damn bike to watch it collect dust. I say let's get across here however. - Me too. - Me three. - Me four. - I'm with 'em. What's the big deal about taking a little shortcut anyway? Are you afraid of the desert too? ♪ 98 bottles of beer on the wall ♪ 98 bottles of beer on the wall, 98 bottles of beer ♪ Take one down, pass it around... ♪ - Are you sure this is it? - I'm sure it is. It's Furnace Canyon Road. It's right on the map. On the map, is it solid or dotted? Solid. Sort of. Roy, did you just see something flash over there? No. No? No, me neither. - Uh-oh. - Uh-oh what? This map says we're heading right for a bomb range, guys. Holy shit! We're out of beer. We're all gonna die! We're all gonna be fried! Alright, pipe down! We are not on a bomb range. And we're not gonna be human French fries or something. - You got the map upside down, Hulk. - I know that, Rachel. I know that. It keeps you on your toes. Hey! Sign-e-ho! Why don't I feel welcome? Why would anybody put a welcome sign way out here anyway? Who'd put a welcome sign out here? Jeez. I tell you, I have seen better roads on a motocross course, admiral. Yeah, well, we'd be late if we went all the way back now. Roy, I think I smell gas. I don't. - Oh, crud! - What? Just that we started with a half a tank and now we're running on fumes. OK. Foster, I did it good. OK, temporarily. Pull it out. What did you fix it With? Foster's special patching compound. - Gum. - Chewing gum? It'll hold temporarily. We're not going far, folks. - How about just using the Super Fuel? - That stuff in this bus? It'd blow up like a bomb. Might as well use jet fuel. There's a fence over there. Maybe there's a ranch where we can buy some gas. Yeah, might as well. OK. Let's just be careful. People who live this far out usually have a reason. Well, it can't hurt to look. This is definitely not the races. This place is pretty weird. Ah, God! - Careful around this place, OK, Cass? - Sure. Oh, wow! - You hear that? - Shh. Uh! Hey, you guys? There's an open mine shaft here. So why don't we all be careful? - Anybody find gas? - Are you kidding? Maybe there's something inside. A storage tank in one of the sheds. This place has had people in it recently. I can tell. Me! Number one explorer, boss! Yes sir! You there, get the loaders up in the barrels! Hurry! My elephant gun, Simba! Come, boss! Hmm! Ungawa! - Hulk, we'll take this other building, OK? - OK. With uh... a couple of coats of paint, this place can look, uh... pretty good. Hold it right there. You know... nobody's lived here in a million years, I bet. I'm not going into those buildings. The trouble with the desert is it's too hot, too big, and full of things that wanna bite your ass just for the hell of it. Typical paranoia of a person alienated from his planetary roots by too much urbanization, in other words, typical paranoia of a black man. - Now, you first. - Uh-huh. There are pythons in there. Pythons aren't even found in the United States, dummy! That's what bothers me. We know they are there, but we can't find the fuckers. Oh, please. Snakey, snakey, snakey. Nice boy. Can you believe this shit? She don't talk to me that nice! Harry, where'd you go? - Roy... - Jane, shh. Did you hear anything weird? Weird? Like what? Like someone with hairy... - Aargh! " Roy! Roy! Shh! What's that? Shh! Caught you! - I really got you good, didn't I? - Yeah. You like this on me? There's nothing but clothes back there. We could open up a shop. You two guys should be committed. Beast! Wait up! Injuns. I think something's up in that loft. It's a raccoon. You smell it? No. I just know how Beast acts when he finds one. Hello? Aargh! She really does know that dog. Heads up, Cass. I gotta put Beast inside. There you go. - What'd he do? - Nothing. Absolutely nothing. He just went ape shit because he smelled some stupid raccoon. It couldn't be. Ah! Pluto! Come on! Ruby! - Rachel, what happened? - Oh, my God! - Beast settled down? - Yeah. Sort of. But that dude is weird. All he does is growl at rocks. His mama must've been attacked by a cement mixer or something. Rachel, you say it was your brother who gave you that? - She fell. - It was my brother! It was my dead brother. He's come back to get me. Rachel... you and Bobby weren't taking controlled substances this morning? I mean, you're both acting very strange today. I mean, what are you talking about? What brother? Sittin' ducks, yeah, yeah. We were sure Pluto was dead. Shit, they all were dead. Fact is, though, Rachel, nobody saw you go in or out of there. The fact is... That crazy wild girl you guys were joking about back on the bus... ...that was me eight years ago. - You mean the family that killed people? - I didn't kill anybody. If that's who you are... I mean were... then you turned against your family, you helped the other family. Bobby's family. That brother I saw in there, he killed Beast's mate the first day. He stole Bobby's niece, and he helped kill his mother and sister. What? Hold on. Rachel, no offense, but you fell and you whacked your bean, and now you're staring a little crooked this afternoon. Wait a minute. Maybe it makes sense. Why is Bobby so afraid of the desert? Yeah, fine, fine. OK, suppose it happened just exactly like she said. She didn't see the guy, just now. She saw a memory. She had a little delayed stress syndrome come down on her, that's all. There ain't no boogeyman. Somebody's out by the bus. Beast! Cass... One of the bikes is gone! Beast, shut up! No one started the motorcycle, I can guarantee that. - Look at this. - Hey, wait a minute. I bet he's trying to roll it out of earshot before he starts it up. That means he's close. - Thirty seconds to launch and counting. - You got it. Roy? Are you doing what I think you're doing? Don't be crazy, don't go out there. Must be Pluto who took it. We'll just get that bike from Pluto, and we'll be right back, ma'am. - Roy! - Let's go. Let's go, bro. Go, go, go! Ah-hoo! OK, you mother! You just moved into our game! Woo! This thing's got the Super Fuel? The half tank switch is right here. Save it for the payoff. Alright, thank you, gentlemen, and I'm off! Woo! Yeah! Come on! Woo! Come on, Harry! Whoo! Whoo! Ha-ha! Come on, boys! Get that fucker! Come on! Come on, come on! Come on, suckers! Come on! You punk asses! Hey, that's not fair! That's Harry's maneuver! Whoo! Yeah! Come on! Harry, you alright? Get that fucker! I got him! You're mine, fucker! Whoo! You better run! You better! Yee-ha! Come on! Come on, buddy! Come on! Hey! You better run! You're dead, fucker! Hey! Come back here, you bastard! Damn it! - Come on, goddamnit! - Ah! Ah! Come on! Come on! Come on, baldy! D'you get him? You need help? I'm right here! OI' Harry'll kick his ass for ya! Harry, help me. I'm hurt. Roy? Roy? You don't fool ol' Harry twice, my friend, nah. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've seen this one before in the movies. Very clever. Sucker. Ha-ha! You missed me, you missed me! ♪ Na na-na, na na-na... ♪ Holy sh... Move it! Go. Go! Come on! Go! Come on! Whoa! Whoa! Harry! Harry! Maybe he got up and went home. Yeah, maybe. You better hope so. Now, who set that trap? - You never should've got off the road. - Oh, yeah? - I ain't the only crazy out here. - Yeah, you're right. Cos you just picked a fight with a whole bus load of 'em! Hello! You think they heard that? If they had their engines off for some reason. Otherwise... Well, they should be able to see the smoke. They could be at the other side of the hills by now. Hey. We got some firecrackers in the bus. - They gotta hear one of those. - That's a good idea. What do you think is up with those guys? What are you looking at, cue ball? I ain't the one you gotta look out for. Oh, yeah? Who else is out here, huh? The Reaper. The Reaper? Who the hell's The Reaper? Hold your ears. Whoa! They gotta hear that sucker. Hello! Anything, Cass? What are you slowing down for? Come on. Go! Come on! We should all just get out. Right now. What on? A magic carpet? We got about two cups of gas in the tank. Besides, this isn't panic city! Come on. Oh, Harry. Whoa! Grab my rope, Pluto! Shit! What was that? Shit! Hey, what's going on? Let me out of here! I think I heard Roy scream. You guys are pitiful! And you, Cass, of all people. You should know, we are dealing with the world's two biggest practical jokers. Look at me when I'm talking to you. Did you really, unmistakably, hear a scream? Not an actual scream. It was a... It was more like a feeling of Roy screaming. Come on. What's everybody getting so paranoid about? I mean, just lighten up. You know? OK. Meanwhile... The best defense is a good offense. Let's just make a surprise for these jokers. - Oh, like what? - I don't know. Foster? OK. As soon as they show, we all hide, wait for 'em to hit this, then we'll jump 'em, scream like mad and scare the shit out 'em! That's brilliant! - You see 'em? - Uh... No. What are you looking for? Candle, radio, blankets. Weapons. Anything we can use to get us through the night. Weapons? You don't have to be afraid of anything. I'll smash anything that comes near you like a bug. What's that? Some kind of machinery? Looks like an old generator. Ruby, hold this. Here. It's diesel. Can't use the fuel for the bus, but we might be able to get some lights out of it. Hey, you believe that Rachel's that Ruby character? Do you believe your Daddy's Santa Claus? - She's Ruby. - How do you know? I don't know, I can tell when someone's lying. OK, Cass, uh... I've got my hands in the air over my head. Tell me if I'm lying, or telling the truth. Lying. From the sound of Sue's breathing, I'd say you had both your hands on her. Ok. OK, so... So, you can see so accurate, what do you see now? Danger. Man, you're a barrel of laughs. I'm sorry. OK, Foster... How do the French eat frog? - With a little fork or something? - No. First they take one little leg and put it over one ear, take the other little leg and put it over the other ear. - Oh, yeah! - Oh, man! Ain't that pretty? - What? - The lights just came on. - How's that for magic? - Oh, don't use the door! - Why not? - Come in through the window. Uh, we... The door is booby trapped. We got light. I want you to stay together and stay alert. This place might look deserted, but it's been used for something right up to the time we got here. And that generator's definitely been in use. - You guys going somewhere? - Hulk and I are gonna look for the guys. You still think that there's something wrong. They've been gone too long to be funny. Either they're playing a joke too hard, or they got themselves lost and need someone with a light. Oh, those jerks. There's no reason to get upset. Keep your heads together and we'll find 'em. Yeah, but you'll just get lost too. Sue, Ruby knows this desert like the back of her hand. I'm telling you, don't worry. Now, come on. - Cass? - Yeah. - Keep your ears open. - I Will. He)', you guys stay here. Sue and I will go look for some tools or something. Ooh, enough of this stuff. It's party time! Be careful. It squeaks. Beast, shh! It's just us. Shh! Shh. Shh. Good. Civilization! Oh, boy, I hate the desert. I despise it. - Sue? - Hmm? It ain't natural to be in a place without a disco. Hmm, I know. No thanks, sugar. I think Beast wants out. Anyway, I don't want him watching us. - Alright. Be back in a second. - OK. Here, boy. Come on. Let's get out of here. Foster, are you coming? Oh, shit! Uh-huh, look at this. I mean... What have you got? A whole box of candles, Cass. Enough for a week. Great. I sure hope we don't need to use all of them. Oh, really. I swear, Cass, sometimes you remind me of a hound dog I used to have. - Thanks a lot! - No. I mean, just hearing and smelling things about ten minutes before the humans. I mean... Now look, sweetheart. You don't have to pussyfoot around me. Know what I mean? I may be blind, but I'm not handicapped. OK, kid? OK. So, what do you smell? There's a draft in here. Smells like cleaning fluid or something. Don't you smell it? This whole place smells weird to me. Yeah, it does. Let's just take those candles and get out of here. Beast. Oh, Beastie. Beast. So what do you think? Maybe we should take that bucket down now. Suppose it's getting kinda stupid having everyone crawling in and out of the window all the time. Oh, no. Let's leave it a while. Cass... You won't believe what I can see. A new bus, gassed up and ready to roll? Next best thing. - What? - Come on. Come on. Back here. What is it? It's a shower. Oh, listen. This is too good to pass up. I'm gonna get out of today's dirt before Harry gets back. - You don't mind, do you? - Nah. I won't look. Anyway, I think I'll go poke around a little bit. - OK. Be careful. - I'll watch my step. Deserts can be full of ghosts. Yeah, well, you know it doesn't have to be like that. I mean, I don't give a damn what you did in your past, Ruby. It may sound a little bit crazy, but... - What I'm trying to say is - Some of your best friends are maniacs. Yeah... something like that. So Bobby's niece was the baby that you saved, huh? Yeah. Katy. She's great! She'll probably grow up to be what her mother wanted to be. - If she'd lived. - A nurse? No, she had a fantasy about becoming a movie star, and being discovered by some big-time director. - Really? - Yeah. Harry? Roy? Whose is it? It's Roy's. It's blood. Oh, God. Come on, let's get us out of here. - Come on! - Hulk! I know you're out there and you wanna fight! Get us out of here! - Come on! - OK. Get on the back. Come on! Hulk, I fell off! Don't leave me! - Hulk! - I'm not gonna leave you! Look out! No! Hulk... R- R-Rachel, just... go. Ruby. Gonna rip you up, girl. Jane? ls everything OK? Foster! What are you doing? I thought I saw a burglar. And so I came out to investigate. But I can see that everything's in order. Very, very much in order! Foster... - Foster? - Huh? What would you do if Sue caught you staring at me like that? I'd tell her to go mind her own business, because this thing is bigger than the both of us. Oh, is it? Oh, gee, Sue, we was just talking. Would you like me to give you something to talk about, Foster? - No, Sue! - No problem. - I was only joking. - You are the joke. Sue! Sue! Come back, I love you! Love. Fuck off! Sue? Sue? Susie? Susie... Sue? I think I better get some wheels. Sue! There's gotta be some gas in here. Alright! Fuck off, you bastard, you! I hate you, Foster! Leave me alone! You ain't so hot anyway! Lady can run! I better cut her off at the pass. Damn! Wait here, Beast. Calm down. Piece of shit! Sue! Sue! Damn. Sue! Sue? Sue! Sue? Sue? Shh! What you do that for? - What's going on? - What's going on? I tell you what's going on, I just got mugged by an ex-bush monkey, that's gonna get her clock cleaned if she don't get off me. I'm sorry. OK... So you don't want your clock cleaned. Any trouble at the mine? Nothing a new girlfriend won't cure. Why you worried? What's wrong? - Hulk's dead. - Say what? Foster? Sue? Hello? You sure that you're not suffering from a sudden onset of one of those weird mental diseases that white folks get from time to time? You go back to the bus. And you get the others ready to leave. I'll find Sue. - Go. - Alright. Go! Might as well stick out my thumbs. This bus is out of service! Beast, come on! Hey, come back here! You're supposed to be my bodyguard! Hmm? Hmm? - Jane? - Hey, Cass. Phew. - Find anything? - Yeah, lots of weird stuff. A butcher or something must've lived here once. - So, what's going on? - I was just looking for Foster and Sue. - You haven't seen them, have you? - Haven't heard them either. - Have you checked the other buildings? - I'm afraid to go in any by myself. That's silly. There's nothing to be afraid of in there. - Uh, great! - What? - The lights just went off. - They did? Yes, damnit! I'm sorry, Cass. It's OK. I know the dark's scary at first. I found a big switch here of some kind a minute ago. Maybe there's separate lights in here. Jane? - Jane! - Yeah! I'm right here. - Did the lights come on? - No. But I did hear something in this other room. - Yeah. Sounds like water or something. - Mm-hm. - Just the sound of the trap going off. - This is a real weird place. Did little Harry get all wet? I know you're in here. Harry. Ha! Cass! Foster? Jane? Anybody? Jane? Sue! Jane! Sue! Ruby. Sue? Ruby, where are you? Come on, come on! Get up, get up! Come on! It's over now, Ruby. I gotta kill you and get in good with The Reaper. The Reaper? Papa Jupe's big brother's here? Ever since Papa Jupe died, Reaper took over. He patched me up. That's how much he thinks of me. - What? He need a dog? - Watch it! We got this whole desert to ourselves, him and me. We kill everybody and we throw them down mine shafts. That's where you're going, Ruby. Right into Reaper's special mine shaft. You better not kill me, Pluto. You hurt me, and you're gonna make Beast real mad. Beast? Who's Beast? You know who Beast is. That's the dog almost killed you eight years ago. You hurt me, and he's gonna get you. You're trying to trick ol' Pluto, Ruby. Besides, ain't no dog can sneak up on me no more. I got hearful ears. See? Stupid piss-licker. Puke-eater! You got the brains of a beer can! Flea bag! Fish bait! Garbage hog! Ruby. Reaper. Ruby... I want you. Uh! I can race. I can race! Oh, God! Beast! What are you doing here, boy? Oh! What happened to my head? Hey- No! Time to say your prayers, dog breath! Pee-ass kid! Puke-eater. Whoa! Way to go, Beast. Way to go, boy. Let's go get Cass now. Come on, boy. Let's go get Cass now. Jane? Sue? Either of you guys in there? Jane? Sure was enough water in that bucket. Ouch! The power's back on. Somebody's in here. Cass. Back to the bus. Come here, boy. Beast, where's the bus? Roy? Roy? You up here? Roy? Roy? Roy! Oh, my God... Jane! Hulk? No! No! Why? Help! Roy! Roy! Cass! Cass, where are you? Cass, where are you? Roy! Cass! - God! - Roy? Give me your hand. Come here. Give me your hand! Alright. Come on, you got it. Alright. Relax, everything's alright. - Did he fall? - Uh-uh. - Cass, is there another way out of there? - Yes. Hold on. Roy, I think I hear him. - What are you doing? - You'll find out. Stand clear, Cass. Alright, come here. Come here. Hold on. Alright, jump... Alright. Alright, hold on. - He might be coming out another way. - Alright! OK. Alright. Alright. Help me push this thing, Cass. Come on. Come on. Come on! Come on! Come on. Alright, alright. Hold up, I got it. - He's coming! - I know, OK. - Roy, we have to get out of here! - No! Cass, not yet. Reaper don't get fooled like Papa Jupe! Oh, no! The Reaper sucks! I'm gonna beat you to shit, Ape Man. I'm gonna wipe up the desert floor with you real good! Now, Cass, go. Go! Come on, Roy! Now, Cass! Cass! Jump, Cass! Whoo! Ha-ha! It worked! Oh, my God. - Whoa! - Oh, God. - Look out! - Come on! - Where'd he go? - He's gone. - Yeah? - He's gone. You did it. He's gone! You're incredible to do that.
