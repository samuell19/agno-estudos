And the people shall suffer 1,000 years, for it is written. And this time shall be known as the Age of Darkness, for the shadow of the Spider shall be the law. Indeed, the people shall pay tribute to the word of the master, and live in bondage in the valley of the shadows, even to the very mists of the volcano that sleeps above. Take heed, when the thousand years is done, a man will come to promise a different way. And he shall be named Toron. Many will believe, and many will be persecuted. The sign of Toron will bear witness to the legend, but Toron will fail, for the wrath of the Spider King is mighty indeed. And the people of the valley shall weep, for there is no hope, for it is also written that the Spider King will reign until the day the mountain speaks forth in anger. Then out of the darkness, the prophecy relives, for Toron cast his seed upon the wind, and even in death, to him is born a son. (woman gasping) It's here. Yes, it's here. [Woman] Don't worry, it won't be long now. (gasping) Push. (gasping) Keep comin', push. It's here. The baby's head is out. - Help me. - Yes. (baby crying) [Woman] Oh, there. Oh, it's a beautiful baby. [Midwife] It's a boy. (baby crying) (gasping) He has the sign Toron. Take him, take your son. May the Gods forgive you. He has the sign of Toron. (lighting striking) (thunder rolling) (wolf howling) (door banging) (thunder rolling) (horses neighing in the distance) (animals whining) It is done. (wind blowing) (thunder rolling) (chuckling) (slow, tense orchestral music) You can trust me, as I trust you, holy one. (slow, tense orchestral music) Ooo (chuckling). Go where you will, my beautiful. (slow, tense orchestral music) [Knight] Lord, lord. The sign is in the sky. What are you saying, fool? [Knight] The animals cry out. And the wind, the trees, the mountain. The earth trembles like a virgin being drawn to the nuptial bed. Now the sky is the color of flame, my lord. Can Toron have had a son? [Guard] Aster, we cannot be certain yet. All the signs tell us that tonight, in some corner of this world, a woman has given birth to the child you speak of. (slow, tense orchestral music) There is no longer any doubt. In order to avert this calamity, the child must die. And our ancient kingdom will never be profane by him. [Woman] Hurry, back to the village. The sign of Toron! [Woman] The child will bring the wrath of the Spider down upon us. The son of Toron is among us. His duty and his mission is to put an end to our ancient ways. We must never allow him to reach manhood. Gather your men together. Seek out the newborn, and extinguish their brief live. We must prevent the prophecy from being fulfilled. [Knights] Long life to the Spider! (men chanting) (slow, tense orchestral music) (baby crying) (men yelling) (slow, tense orchestral music) (horse neighing) [Man] The child has the sign or Toron over his heart. Find him, kill him! (men yelling) (slow, tense orchestral music) (women screaming) [Man] Catch them, catch them all. (women screaming) (slow, tense orchestral music) [Woman] No, please, have mercy. (sheep baaing) (men yelling) Now, High Priest, I will make you bitterly repent. The day you exiled me from the Kingdom of the Spider, I, Griba, will be avenged through this tiny child. (sheep baaing) (baby vocalizing) Grow fast and grow strong, young Ator. You have much to do. [Narrator] In the pages of the Sacred Book it is written, "there will come one from the North. "Tall warrior who will challenge the rule "of the Spider King. "He will be called Toron, but he will be vanished. "And many years will pass in which "the Spider reigns supreme, but one day "there will come another, for to Toron "will be born a son. "An even mightier warrior they will call Ator. "When the time is near, the Great Eagle "will shed tears of blood, then those "who defend the dark regions of the Spider Kingdom "must prepare for battle, for Ator "will cast light upon the darkness." (slow, tense orchestral music) Oh, Ancient One. The word of the prophet was untrue. The son of Toron is no more. The kingdom is safe at last. Now you can spread your web. And all those who walk on Earth, will be forced to your bidding. (men yelling) (banging) [Man] Gidrick? [Boy] Yes? [Man] Put an edge on this blade. [Boy] Go ahead. (banging) (dog barking) [Woman] Here, this is from us, Nordya. [Nordya] Thank you. (dog barking) (door opening) [Bardak] Who are you stranger? What do you want of us? From this day on, you will receive food, so that you may eat. And you will be given herbs that will cure you, and arms for the hunt. And in return, you must raise this child as your own. I've never seen you before. What is your name? I am called Griba, but it doesn't matter. Better that you forget it. You will never see me again. But I will be keeping an eye on you. And on him. The boy will be in safe hands with us. We're a simple, honest folk here, and I have milk enough. If this man keeps his promise, we won't need the charity of the villagers anymore. You will lack nothing. Because nothing must lack Ator. Ator. (Ator vocalizing) [Bardak] You always wanted a boy, didn't you? [Nordya] Oh yes, Ator. Ator! (slow orchestral music) I couldn't find you. Don't leave me like that, ever. But I was in the woods. Here, I brought you a present. [Sunya] Oh, what's his name? [Ator] Kiog. (chuckling) [Sunya] Oh. I love you. And I love you. (slow orchestral music) Why can't we marry? Ator, we are brother and sister. (slow orchestral music) I'll talk with our father. (horse neighing) (slow, tense orchestral music) (banging) (animals sounding) You're already a better hunter than I am. Well I owe it to you, father. What's the matter with you, Ator? You have sad eyes. Are you in love by any chance? Who told you? My heart told me. And your mother's heart. But there's nothing wrong about that. All young men fall in love, and you're a man now. (slow orchestral music) Father, you see, I would've told you sooner. You remember how our ancestors used to allow marriage between brother and sister? I know times have changed, but... Ator, you don't know how really happy you make me. Well then you're saying... You'd allow me to marry my sister? She is not your sister. Sunya is not your sister. Come here, Nordya, come here. [Nordya] What is it, Bardak? Ator and Sunya want to marry. - He knows? - Yes, I just told him. You mean he's not my brother? No, my child, he is not. You both sucked the same milk from the same breast, but we are not his parents. He is the offspring of another couple. (slow orchestral music) Who are my parents? A man came out of the woods with you. My father? I don't think so. A real parent would not have abandoned his child the way he did. Why didn't you tell me, mother? We didn't, Ator, 'cause we thought it would make you unhappy. And now? And now that you have decided to marry Sunya we are very happy for both of you. Congratulations. Well then you'll be my parents for the second time. Did you hear that, Nordya? I think we have to give the good news to the whole village. Yes. (slow, tense orchestral music) My lord? I sincerely hope you have something urgent to tell me. I say that because if you have not, you'll have to pay dearly for this intrusion. The news I have for you is of Griba. Griba? Yes, master. I saw him this morning, my lord, in the forest by the village that lies on the edge of our kingdom. So he has dared to defy our ancient laws once again. This time, he shall die. I want his head. You hear? Yes, master. (upbeat instrumental music) (upbeat instrumental music) Oh, Corg, god of fecundity, bless this young couple. Protect and purify them with your great strength so that they may offer you their youth. (people cheering) [High Priest] Destroy them! (men yelling) (people yelling) (slow, tense orchestral music) (men yelling) (hitting) (yelling) (horse neighing) (men yelling) (slow, tense orchestral music) (struggling) (hitting) [Man] Thank you. (hitting) (yelling) (fighting) (hitting) (yelling) (hitting) (hitting) (slow, tense orchestral music) (hitting) (yelling) Find Griba, get him. I want his head. (horse neighing) (yelling) (hitting) Griba, where are you? Get me Griba and you will be spared. (men yelling) (hitting) Halt, don't kill the girl. Take her with him. (Sunya yelling) [Sunya] Let me go! No, let me go! No! (yelling) (people yelling) (slow, tense orchestral music) (men yelling) (groaning) (groaning) (slow, somber orchestral music) Father. (slow, somber orchestral music) (slow, tense orchestral music) (birds chirping) (water running) (gasping) (grunting) (hitting) (grunting) (hitting) (grunting) (hitting) (grunting) (hitting) (grunting) You have learned to fight like a tiger, but that is not sufficient. Now you must learn to use your head and fight like a man. I thought you were one of the Black Knights. They attacked my village, and killed my people. They've stolen my wife. Yes, I know, Ator. How do you know my name? I've never seen you before. I know more about you than you know yourself. But no one has ever known but me. I don't understand. On your body, you bear the mark of your destiny, but you cannot see it, yet. You were born to defeat the Ancient One, the Spider King. You will be able to see that mark, but first, you must prepare yourself. The road ahead is long and hard. [Ator] What do you mean? I took you from the forest, Ator, to save you from the wrath of Dakkar, who hunts me now. I gave you to Nordya, who suckled you as her own and raised you as a brother to Sunya. What do you know about Sunya? Have no fear, for the moment, she is in no danger. They want her alive, and now, come. You must follow me. (slow, tense orchestral music) These are the weapons of my vanquished enemies. As you can see, I have had many enemies. The only weapons missing are those of the High Priest, Dakkar. One day, I shall have them also. That belonged to Chun the Terrible. I defeated him in combat during the assault on the City of the Winds, which was governed by the notorious Seven Siamese Sisters. Try to hit me. What do you mean? Hit me. You sure? (grunting) (sword clanging) (chuckling) The same rashness cost Chun his life. Now, rule number one when you fight: keep the legs apart. With equilibrium of the body distributed evenly. Like this? (yelling) (hitting) Rule number two: surprise. Keep your wits about you, and listen. There are many secrets, Ator, and you are here with me to learn them, it is your destiny. (slow, tense orchestral music) (clinking) (clinking) (slow, tense orchestral music (hitting) (hitting) (sword clanging) Again. (slow, tense orchestral music) (chuckling) (hitting) (hitting) (grunting) (grunting) (hitting) (grunting) (grunting) (grunting) (gasping) (hitting) Again. (yelling) (hitting) (hitting) (grunting) [Man] There she is! (tense orchestral music) (splashing) (tense orchestral music) [Ator] Cowards, setting upon a lone woman. (hitting) (yelling) (hitting) (yelling) (yelling) (hitting) (tense orchestral music) Don't I even get a thank you for helping you out? I could've handled it alone, if you hadn't intruded. How was I to know? - Were they trying to rob you? - I was the one who robbed them. - What's your name? - I don't use names. Ha! Griba! Griba, where are you? (slow, tense orchestral music) I've found it at last. The sword of Toron. (slow, tense orchestral music) Now I'll avenge my honor. (slow, tense orchestral music) (grunting) (struggling) (slow, tense orchestral music) (dog barking) Mhm. A fine example of the species. He'll suit our purpose very well. Tie him to the tree. (gong sounding) Get the fighters here. (gong sounding) (slow, tense orchestral music) The victor at the end of the contest will have the great honor to bear the child that is our future leader. Let the fighting start. (slow, tense orchestral music) (grunting) (hitting) (hitting) (hitting) (grunting) (slow, tense orchestral music) (yelling) (hitting) (slow, tense orchestral music) (hitting) (yelling) You, Roon, will be the one to carry in your body the future Queen of our tribe. Now claim the prisoner, he is yours for tonight. As the sun rises tomorrow, you will kill him. You don't have much choice. Are you ready to perform the duty that is my right? Well, well, no. Actually... I love another. (chuckling) And where is the lucky one? Where is this wonderful virgin? Hm? Have you lost your tongue? She's being held captive in the temple of the Ancient One. The Black Knights kidnapped her from beneath my very eyes. But not for long. You want to desecrate the temple of the Spider? I have no other goal in my life. Alone? I'm well prepared, I can assure you. No one has ever returned alive from the temple of the Spider. The Holy Book says, that only the son of Toron can defeat the Ancient One. I will find her. I will recover my love. I hope she's still alive. I owe you my life. It occurs to you now. You wouldn't admit it by the river bank. It's different now. (chuckling) Glad for that. I will spare your life, but, you must take me with you. Altruism doesn't suit you any better than maternity, Roon. What's your idea? Gold. So much gold and silver or jewels, shut up in the temple of the Spider. It could be ours without any difficulty. That's my idea. It could change our future. You haven't even told me your name. (chuckling) I don't use names, remember? (slow, tense orchestral music) That looks like the sword of Toron. How did you come to have it? There's no time for that, now. We've got to get it back. But it's not going to be easy. Look, there are guards over there. If they discover us, we won't stand a chance. I'll take care of the sword, you keep watch. Alright. Our only hope lies in distracting them. [Roon] It's out in the open, the guards will see you. [Ator] We'll leave that to Kiog, he'll keep them busy. Go ahead, Kiog, create a little chaos for us. Go on. Go on. (dogs barking) (slow, tense orchestral music) - What's going on? - Let's go and find out. (dogs barking) (slow, tense orchestral music) [Leader] They're trying to get away! Catch them and bring them back! I want them captured. Quick, get moving! Come with me! - We'll go this way. - Don't let them escape! (slow, tense orchestral music) (guards yelling) [Woman] I found tracks here! (hitting) (slow orchestral music) (slow, tense orchestral music) (rocks falling) Roon? Where are you? Roon! (slow, tense orchestral music) Sunya! Sunya, wait for me! [Indun] Ator! Come! I'm in here. Follow me, Ator. (slow, tense orchestral music) Ator, come to me, I'm here! Sunya. But... You're not... It doesn't matter who I am. (slow, tense orchestral music) You must be tired. Here. Drink this. (slow, tense orchestral music) No! Never touch that drape. I was expecting you. You will be happy here. It's peaceful. The days run into the nights, and the nights into the days. Time will mean nothing to you. You will feel that you've stepped into eternity. Here we are all immortal. She looked at me. I heard her voice. She smiled at me. (chuckling) She smiled at you, did she? That's what you thought. Do you want to see your beloved? Come here. Come on. (slow, tense music) I will show you your loved one. (slow, tense music) I will show you your loved one. Sunya. (slow, tense music) No. No. That's impossible. No, my dear. That was the girl you gave year heart to. You saw her with your own eyes. She is only too happy to have been chosen to wed the Ancient One. (slow, tense music) You will be mine until you have no strength left to gratify me. (Kiog snorting) Kiog! Good boy, you found me. Help me escape! Come on, Kiog. Hurry! (Kiog snorting) Come on, Kiog, you can do it! (slow, tense orchestral music) [Ator] Indun, how beautiful you are. The sight of your face fills me with strange joy. (slow, tense orchestral music) Your touch, is ecstasy. (slow, tense orchestral music) (groaning) (Kiog snorting) (snake hissing) This is Prince Sultan, of the Zori tribe. He opposed my will and I transformed him into an owl that has to sit on a perch. Come, Ator. (water running) (bird chirping) (slow, tense orchestral music) You know what to do, Kiog. Go on! (slow, tense orchestral music) (Kiog snorting) [Indun] Get out of here! (Kiog snorting) (clanging) (slow, tense orchestral music) (screaming) (slow, tense orchestral music) Ator, a curse on you. Come quickly. Escape while you can. [Indun] You'll pay for this Ator. I shall be avenged. If we can get through this jungle, we will be out of Indun's territory. It's too still. [Roon] Now we must pass through the land of the walking dead. [Ator] Well, if we gotta go. (slow, tense orchestral music) (slow, tense orchestral music) (slow, tense music) (dead soldiers groaning) They've disappeared. Come on, let's get out of here. (people talking) Ah. [Man] Join you for a jug? Yeah, why not. Suit yourself. (Kiog snorting) Alright if I take her for two clesidras, huh? Mm, mhm. Thank you. [Woman] Come on. Hey, where do you think you're goin'? Let the man look at ya. [Man] Yes, she's fine. Here, take this. (laughing) (coins tinkling) We need two horses. I'm sure the cripple will know how to get them. I think it'll be more expensive than you reckon. I don't think you need to worry too much about the cost. Watch this. Listen now, I told you once, I told you thousand times. (hitting) (groaning) Leave her alone, waste your money on these women. You'll give me a heart attack, that's my money! (hitting) (yelling) [Man] I never saw her in my life before. [Woman] Who is she? (hitting) (yelling) (woman crying) (slow, tense orchestral music) Griba, wait! What's the hurry? (shucking) (gasping) (Kiog snorting) (slow, tense orchestral music) Griba, Griba, wait! (hitting) (groaning) [Man] I'll take care of her. (hitting) - [Woman] Don't be stupid. I am the only one to posses the secret of your true identity, Ator. And I can restore the proof of your birth to you now, as I hid it from you when you were a baby. Here is the mark of Toron, your father. Yes, Ator, you are the son of Toron. It is of you, the sacred books, have written, and of your destiny to defeat the Ancient One. And now, after long years of patience, the moment has come. Now you must go to to the Volcano of Shadows and take possession of the Shield of Mordor, the shield which wards off death. It will render you immortal, as long as it remains in your keeping. Then you will fulfill your destiny in the temple of the Spider. From this day on, you will have no further need of me. (slow, tense orchestral music) Tears of blood. Son of Toron lives. Gah. I was counting on you, Ator. Oh, I thought you always counted on yourself. Ugh. Black Knights, prepare your men to defend the Kingdom of the Ancient One. The son of Toron has returned, on the same mission as his father, and our old enemy must be vanquished, and the Spider's kingdom saved from the fate Ator intends for it. I, Dakkar, have no fear of holy books. It is not the prophet of the Spider, who decides the course of destiny. [Knights] Long life to the Spider. (men chanting) (Kiog snorting) Look, Roon, there it is. The heart of that volcano, in its shadows, lies the shield of Mordor. It possesses magic powers, and I must have it in order to fight the Ancient One. I'll help you get it. The shield is my destiny, not yours. What do you know about my destiny? Not yet, wait. We'll have to pass through the caverns of the Blind Warriors. They have a highly developed sense of smell, so rub these leaves on your skin, and they won't be able to detect us. The sign of Toron. So you are the son of Toron. I don't understand, why didn't you tell me? Even I didn't know about it until a little while ago. A man's fate is only revealed to him when he's halfway through his life. If it were revealed sooner, it would only seem an illusion. So then it was not your beloved Sunya who drove you to the Kingdom of the Ancient One. Sunya's not an illusion, if that's what you think. Sunya is a part of my destiny. (Kiog snorting) (banging) (banging) (banging) (banging) (banging) (banging) (banging) (banging) (banging) (banging) (banging) (banging) (banging) (banging) (banging) (banging) (banging) You alright?

(clinking) (clinking) (slow, tense orchestral music) (clinking) (clinking) (clinking) (slow, tense orchestral music) (clinking) (clinking) (clinking) (clinking) So that's what Mordor's power consists of. Don't you realize? If it has struck me, the shield would've been yours. I'm not interested in the shield. It's of no value to me. That's true. Your concern is the treasure. That's the only reason I'm with you. We both found what we were looking for. Wait! I want my treasure. Leave it. You'll soon have all the gold of the Ancient One. (banging) (banging) (banging) (grunting) (tense orchestral music) (hitting) (yelling) (hitting) (yelling) (hitting) (grunting) (grunting) (hitting) (weapon clanking) (hitting) (yelling) (tense orchestral music) Roon, let's get out of here. (tense orchestral music) [Knights] Long life for the Spider! (knights chanting) (hitting) (yelling) (hitting) (grunting) (hitting) (grunting) (Kiog snorting) (tense orchestral music) The Spider's treasure, Ator. The richest treasure in the world. Yes. Your blessed treasure. And now I think our paths separate. I must find Sunya. Now nothing stands between you and your destiny. Our ways, Ator, divide here. (tense orchestral music) [Ator] Come on! (tense orchestral music) (hitting) (hitting) [Knight] They have invaded the Temple of the Spider. Kill them! [Knight] Follow me! (slow, tense orchestral music) Welcome, Ator. (chuckles) (clinking) (tense orchestral music) (clinking) (grunting) (clinking) (hitting) (yelling) (clinking) (clinking) (yelling) (clinking) (yelling) (clinking) (clinking) (yelling) (clinking) (grunting) (clinking) (yelling) (clinking) (hitting) [Knight] Now you will die like a dog. (clinking) (grunting) (clinking) (exploding) (yelling) [Sunya] Help! Help! That sounds like Sunya. Go. (screaming) (slow, tense orchestral music) (screaming) (slow, tense orchestral music) Help! Save me! (screaming) Sunya! What are you doing here? No one can obstruct the will of the Spider. Not even the son of Toron. But it was you who guided me to this place. In order to regain my rightful place and only to return to what I have always been. The High Priest of the Spider. (yelling) (screaming) (yelling) (clinking) (clinking) (clinking) (tense orchestral music) (yelling) I am your priest! No! (yelling) Ator, take me away from here. First I must complete what I was born to do. (slow, tense orchestral music) (tense orchestral music) (tense orchestral music) (hitting) (grunting) (hitting) (hitting) (hitting) (hitting) (yelling) (booming) [Roon] Oh. [Ator] Roon. (gasping) Won't you let me see your beloved Sunya? Yes, of course. I'll go get her. No, no. Perhaps, it's better like this. If I can't see her, I could still believe she's just one of your... Illusions. Roon. Roon.
