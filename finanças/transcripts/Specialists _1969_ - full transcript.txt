It's disgusting! Band of bastards! Why me and not others! Sorry! Swing the others too! Why are you attacking me? Bastards! No ! Let me go! Hands off ! Bastards! No ! Let me go! Silence! Listen to me. I hate guys like you. You're shit. The scum of the human race To save your skin, you will have to pay. Here's the offer. I lend you a dollar. Whoever brings it back, will live. Others... too bad for them. Damn, it's mine ! Hands off! Give it to me ! This is mine. Smile. Thank you sir. Continue to drink... I get nervous when someone stops drinking... When I'm nervous, I shoot. You belong to El Diablo's bandits and you're very stupid. You should always inspect a building before indulging in it! Romero... where are you? Stay calm... I'm going to deal with your friends... Look out! Go on... outside. Hurry up ! Hud... the great Hud. Mount on your horse and go! Goodbye. Tell El Diablo greetings from me. Bastard! Son of a bitch! This bandit must be taken to the Sheriff of Blackstone ! To be lynch before the trial? It's your specialty. I protest! Do something someone! Do something ? With Hud ? To open a third eye for me? Me, two are enough for me. Listen, friend, I'm a bad shooter. I am not your friend. Hud, if you go to Blackstone, be careful. Sheriff is tough... it's prohibited to carry guns in Blackstone. It's a friend's advice, right? I just told you... Hud has no friends. We're young Hud, we'll come with you. We'll conquer the world together! Do it without me. Sheriff... Sheriff, they're all waiting for you... ...at the office. Why that bandit was released? Give us our weapons back. This man is coming to town. I just want to uphold the law. And I'll do it, but I ain't giving your guns back. I'll protect you like I said, only your guns stay right there. I'm the law around here... ...until I quit. How do you intend to protect us? Prevent Hud from coming to town. - It's against the law. - I fuck the law. Judge! We don't want this man here! He will be disarmed. Stay home. This is not your business. Hud, disarmed ? Do not joke, Sheriff. No one has ever succeeded in disarming him. This man must not enter the city. I understand your fear very well. Hud is Charlie's brother... ...who was lynched in this city. For our misfortune... If Hud wants revenge, he must kill us all. Because we are all responsible. All. In town, they say it's me who threw the first stone, when in fact it was him. What are you saying, imbecile ! And Woodie, with his ivory cane... No, it was Jenkins... who put the rope around his neck, and tightened with all his force. The whole city has seen it. Cause always, loan shark! Dirty thief! Your wife knows something. Leave my wife out of this ! Enough ! Calm down ! Stop! You have no shame... to behave so? Hud arrives in town, Sheriff. We are paying you to defend us. If you are afraid of confronting him, we will go to someone else. That's right, madam, I am paid, and poorly paid, to enforce the law. But everyone must respect the law. You too. You were quite right. We'd be fools to put our trust in him. We all know why Hud is coming... to find the cash of his brother. We have the same goal... to find the cash. Hey if you looking for my Pa mister, he ain't here. I see... My father is not here, go away! I will scream. Who are you looking for ? What do you want ? I beg you, leave. You're Sheba. Aren't you? Yes. How do you know ? Come. Help me. How long have you been living in here ? - About three months. My Pa bought this place after Charlie was Killed. You mean lynched... I reckon! How many were they? Ten? Forty? Whatever. They are alive, and he's dead. Don't let him find you here. You little idiot! I told you never to talk to a stranger. You have to obey me, understand? Otherwise I will kill you. It's mine. Do you want to kill me for this piece of paper? Boot! Give me that rifle. And I'm fining you five dollars. You know the law... no exceptions. But Sheriff... I gave orders. I laid down the law that nobody has the right to carry a gun... You will be fined five dollars... for breaking the law. It's a good lesson for you. Understood? The carrying of weapons is prohibited in the region. Guns are bad advisers. We saw it with Boot Johnson. Let it be clear... you will not enter the city with your guns. If our rules don't suit you, just keep riding on. It's me who decides what suits me or not. It's not difficult to guess your intentions. We know the facts of Dallas, from Yuma, San Antonio, Kansas City, Oklahoma... l continue ? Your revolver is famous. No man could beat Hud in a gunfight. You know me ? Everyone knows you. In the city, we only talk about you. "Hud will arrive. Sheriff, what are you going to do? " However I do believe you'll give me your gun... And I'm not kidding. It's clear ? Why do you think I'd really come back? I came to avenge my brother and to discover the truth. I know it, Hud. All the more reason for you to disarm. Brunhilde, prepares the room with the sauna. So... I see everyone are disarmed? Eh... Sheriff ? Well nearly everyone... Come on... move along now. How are you, Valencia? Bad, like everything in Blackstone. I hope you will find the money stolen from the bank. There were all my savings. Money stolen by my brother? Stolen by someone who had Charlie killed. The dead do not speak. Are you here to get his killer? You are here for him, right? For him... and for all others. And me ? Have you ever forgotten me? Come here and pick a card. A miracle will happen. Gentlemen, in a poker game, we can win with this magic box making dollars. Well... is there no takers? Where are the notables of the city? - They're all at home hiding. Ever since Hud got back... ...an epidemic has erupted. An epidemic of fear. - Afraid of what ? He is a man like the others. Maybe he shot some Mexicans... But I must say that in front of me, he put his gun away... and left quickly. Welcome, Hud! Hi, Hud. You know me, I love to joke. Me too, I love to joke. Sometimes. He, Boot, what are you doing? Are you waiting for the pastor? You do it right. The Church forgives, the law no. Have you seen Hud... Sheriff? Instead of going fishing, you should chase the jackal. For the moment, I prefer fishing for trout. How are you, Hud? I'm glad you came to visit your brother. Without me and the Sheriff, they would not even bury him. They said, "He's a thief. Leave him to the vultures. " Eh... Do you know what I decided to do? Do you want to know? I will tell you. I buried him in the coffin I had reserved for myself. The one with a beautiful pillow to put the head. I had paid, if my memories are good, fifteen dollars or maybe more... I hope I won't need it myself, near future... Lord! - Yes ? Hello, Hud! I'm really happy to see you. I'm probably the only one, in town who feels this way. Are we still friends? I have no friends. You have not changed. You are always the same. Like when we were kids. Do you remember ? You're the only one who never tried to seduce me. You, on the other hand... ...you have changed a lot. You were beautiful and young... But now you're... you're all dried out. Dried out? You may be right. A woman without love is a rose without water. You know... There's no man here worth looking at... Only scum. Since the death of my husband, I feel lonely and abandoned. Abandoned? ...You inherited a bank. Huh... the bank... Yes... I want to speak about that with you. And about your brother Charlie... l trusted him you know. He was to carry the bank's money in secret to Dallas. El Diablo was planning to rob us. I wanted to get the cash out of his reach. The town still blame me for that. I had such faith in Charlie. I lost everything. I did not imagine that... You know what ? No one puts a single dollar in my bank. So sad to hear... When Charlie returned hurt and with no money... They accused him of stealing. You know what followed... ...this awful manslaughter. Since then I have always been lonely. Very lonely. Hud... I do not care why you are here. I would like to see you again. Don't worry you will. Hello boy. Thank you for finding my fish. I'm not a boy. What you are, I don't care. Give it back, it's mine. Prove it, Sheriff. This fish was flying in the sky like a bird. Kit gave a pebble to Rosencraz. Rosencrantz threw it... and bang... the fish dropped... In the front of Apache. Look Sheriff... It's not yours. According to the law, this fish is ours. If you believe your star, you enforce the law. Correct, Sheriff ? I see... you're laughing at me ? But not at all. We have the greatest respect for the old fools. The old fool piss you off! Watch out for the old fool! Are you mad, Sheriff? He's crazy ! The water is disgusting! Who are you and what are you doing in Blackstone? Old bully. Will I start again ? - No ! We come from Dallas. To find the treasure. Which treasure? - You know it very well. All the West is talking about it. - About what? Dollars stolen from the bank in Blackstone... ...and about Sheriff... who let the bandits away. We want to find the loot. If we find it, we can buy weapons... ...and acquire authority. Whether Hud agrees or not. Listen to me, you brat. This money is a matter of law, and authority here, it's me. Do you know Hud? Are you his friends? Hud has no friends, you should know. Sheriff ! Sheriff ! The widow Pollicut is looking for you. She wants to talk to you. She's waiting for you at her place. Bon appetite ! Let's go. May I come in? Anybody here? Come, Sheriff. On your left. What are you doing ? I'm sorry, Mrs. Pollicut, I'm... You search my closet? No, not at all, I was wrong. I thought you were there. In the closet ? How silly ! Come in. Please, pour the water before it cools. Yes of course. You don't mind, if we talk while I'm in the bath? Not at all ! Do so. Is it right? Yeah... imagine so. Very hot. What a good dancer you are! I'm a little... I eh... I eh... sort of think I'd better wait outside. - Oh no. There's no hurry, Sheriff! I understand... you'd rather be with the boys in the saloon. Men are so lucky to be able to have fun. Hold. Come on... Turn around. I need to talk to you about certain things. So it may take a long time... Would you open the champagne? - Champagne? It comes straight from France. Make the cap disappear. Go taste it, it is excellent. Thank you but... ...you called me to talk about something urgently. I wouldn't want to waste time. You never waste time... with a woman like me Sheriff. Now... ...permit me to tell you my personal opinion of Hud. Nobody wants to play? What a shitty city! Howdy, Hud. Come, we need to talk. El Diablo want's to speak with you. He sent one of his men. You're ought to ride to the mountains. It's very important... ...and very personal. You will not go, huh? Beware of Mexicans. What is this stuff? This ain't fit for pigs. Valencia! Your whiskey tastes like urine. I'll complain to the sheriff. He's gonna close up this pigsty. Hold your tongue, Boot. They throw men in prison for slander ! Listen to me, little whore. Your bottles of whiskey contain the piss of your gang of whores. This urine... ...Is your special brand. You talk too much, Boot. Beat it ! You're voice is getting on my nerves... Finally... if you're so nervous... take a walk. Guys... let's make him more nervous. Time to have fun. Quick, someone... call the Sheriff ! Call the Sheriff ! Don't stop, continue... - Don't you hear? There's a trouble in the saloon. I'd better go. - No, it's just drunkards. Silly... look for it. Sheriff... what are you doing? Sorry, I confused it with the soap. I really think I'd better get down there. Sorry madam... ...I have to go. Now you are going to tell me... ...who gave you the money to buy my brother's house ? Speak! It's better for you. Or I'll beat you dead. - I know nothing. I do not know anything. - Who paid you to kill Charlie? Tell me ! Speak, damn it! Hud, watch out!! What's going on? Finally here Sheriff... it was Hud... Tell me... what happened... ...in front of everybody. What are you going to do, Sheriff? It was legitimate defense. The legitimate defense or the legitimate massacre? If Adelita left with another... It's you ? - Who else ? My father. Why do you still insist on calling him, your father? He was only your father-in-law. What... Was ? Did you Kill him... ...I don't care. Tell me everything you know. You're the only one that I can trust. I don't know much... The only thing I know is that when Charlie got killed that night... What happened that night? When my father returned that night... ...I heard him speaking with someone outside. I heard: "That son of a bitch played with us... ...he had to hide the money before the ambush." That's what I know. I am convinced that Charlie was innocent. He had been set up. Sheba... - Yes ? What I did tonight... ...was in defenfe. Not for revenge. What are you going to do ? I don't know. Wait for me. I'll show you what happens when you attac against the sheriff ! I shoot better than you! But instead of killing you... ...I will force you to crawl... ...and to beg my forgiveness. Come out... and face me. Say that you're sorry. Hey... ...are you hurt? You can't escape. Where is he going? Hud! Hud! Hud... are you wounded? I don't think so... How did you do that? The secrets of the business. You're under arrest anyhow. Watch out... ...whatever you say, can be held against you. Take note... you are a fool. And you, a son of a bitch! That's right, my mother worked in a saloon. But, it does not allow you to make a judgment. Where do you go? See a friend. You are in a state of arrest! You are my prisoner, whether you like it or not! I will be your shadow. Did you find your friend? Today, on the fifth day of the summer... Francisco Rafael Pacorro... ...who's called El Diablo, by all who fear him... ...captured the Sheriff of Blackstone... ...formerly called Peda Negra, and Hud, who was his amigo... ...but who is now with the gringo... ...son of bitches. Did you got it ? - It's written. Bravo, Chico ! The world must know that El Diablo wants to send these dogs to hell ! The bastards who have stolen our lands. Very good ! No, it's very bad. Why do you work for Americanos? They lynched your brother. And the Sheriff did nothing to stop them. You, on the other hand, you Killed five of my men... ...and you boot my captain's ass. I'll kill him, Diablo. Just try, it will hurt. Son of a bitch! Romero! Romero... ...it'"s me who decides who to Kill. Okay. You understand... he's a little nervous. There... ...have one back. - That's enough'! If you want to fight you'll do... it my way, not the gringos. With me, you would not dare. Not true ? You see ! He does not dare... ...yellow ! He's afraid. Cursed gringo! Chico... this you don't write... ...but you write this. The sheriff very strong. El Diablo is much stronger. He agreed to let the sheriff fight with him. According to our old tradition... prepare the gringo for "The Contest". You called... here I am. - You were supposed to come alone. Sheriff followed me. This say anything to you? What do you mean? Who gave it to you? One of my spies told me... ...that someone stole half a million dollars from Blackstone Bank. I had my eye... on this bank for many weeks. But these son of bitches... get the loot before me. So I decided to catch the thief. I'm much smarter than the sheriff and I found that poor bastard. It was your brother Charlie... ...half dead... ...a bullet hole on his back. But he managed to hide the money. I asked... where's the money? ...you are going to die. He said... this dollar... ...bring it to the cemetery. No idea why. Then... ...he murmured Ave Maria... Yes, Ave Maria... And... vanished. When we left, he was still alive. Later... the Americans came... looking for the money... and they killed him without pity. The worst of all, was Boot. You must kill him. It's already done. Bravo! All you have to do is find the money. And bring it to me. I'll find it. And you will bring it to me. Not true ? Very good. What about the Sheriff... Him ? Ha... if he manages "The Contest" he'll be free to go. Hey Chico, get him a horse Hud! Where are you going ? He will get the money and bring it to me. If he doesn't? - El Diablo will be furious. He will kill you and destroy the town and that all will be history... ...write all this down. Chico. You forget one thing. Me ? No. My gun... Remember... as a youngsters... ...we used to draw on each other. One day... one damn gringo...cut my right arm off... ...for stealing a loaf of bread. You went away... to play with the real guns... I stayed and and taught my left arm to kill Gringo's... ...and cut off their arms, legs and something else off too. For pity... I cut their heads. And all that... ...with just one hand too! That's right. Don't forget... with one hand. If you do not believe me, try. Go ahead. I don't play with toy guns. You have to face the Sheriff. And later... maybe you... Wake up, Hud. When you come back with the money, we will fight, you and me. Good luck Sheriff, if it's true that you're hard headed... you will survive. I'll meet you, Hud. I will find you again ! Get out ! Imbecile morons ! Why don't you arrest them ? I take orders only from Sheriff. He's not here. What are we going to do? If the Sheriff is gone, we'll take care of Hud. First we need to nominate a new Sheriff. Why worry? We have here his deputy. Me the Sheriff ? For salary of deputy ? To catch Hud... I have wife and children. So, let's nominate another. He, for example. He is young, fast, and he knows Hud. I'm not the right man for the job. Even though... I don't lack the courage for it. But if Mrs Virginia insists, for her, I am ready for anything. I think the best solution is to send a telegram to Dallas... ...and ask for a new federal marshall. He is right. - No need for foreigners. Better to wash our dirty clothes with the family. Go! Go ahead ! Attack I Winning stroke! Long live EIl Diablo! Write it up, Chico... ...the whole world must know. Come on, El Diablo! Finish it, El Diablo! Send him to hell! He has a hard head, this gringo! Listen to this... The cow ! So, we'll drop his pants. Get off the roof! No ! Help ! Open your fly! Help ! Let me go! What are you doing ? Stop, guys! - This is not funny. Listen... Sheba. We love you, you know. - We like you. We will make you a proposal. Join our revolutionary group. The fruits. Great ! - We're serious. You will have four friends. We will protect you. - And we will amuse you. Take a smoke. No thanks. ...I can't... I'm a girl! And what do you think I am?... How can you live like this? We live very well in our commune. Try... If you smoke, it's easier. Innocent maiden... We'll make you love us... - Smoke, you'll like it. - No ! You will experience something new... Hi, Hud! You arrived at the right time.. Lend us a hand. This white goose refused to join us. You can have fun with her! Get out of here... ...or I'll help you to do it... ...get out I said ! Get out ! I've been worried about you. The Sheriff is missing... ...they say you've killed him. They want to make you suffer the same fate as your brother. Don't worry... Sheba... listen... When is the time to pray Ave Maria? At Six O' Clock... why? Wait for dawn... ...come here... ...and the light... ...stop. If it's a game... explain to me. Nothing special... ...you'll understand tomorrow. Excuse me... I didn't want... Is it Charlie's gun ? I saw it in the photo... ...don't use it. You must not use it. We can live without violence. Without killing, without pain. I have never known... ...that kind of life. Maybe it's because... ...you don't want to know that kind of life. Words are useless, Sheba... ...only acts count. Especially if they are final. Like death. Which is irreversible. Give me back my brother... and I will lay down the weapons. Can you do it, Sheba ? No... ...I just want to help you... ...to forget. You're here early Hud. Even before sunrise. It must be a good occasion to visit the dead at this time. It's like this... ...maybe one of them will be pleased today. Sun's up Oscar. There used to be a hole in the wall right? Yeah, plugged it up myself. That's my job... keep the place tidy. Otherwise, I wouldn't do this business. Dig that grave up. Huh ? Hurry up ! Hurry up ? These things are done calmly. Hey... what's that... ...I'll don't remember burying that. Now that was real smart... hey Hud? Lay that box rest in peace, Lord. Bravo. You survived El Diablo. How did you do that? The secrets of the business. Hand me that cash box. Slowly... ...very easy. You're making a mistake Sheriff. I promised that money to El Diablo. He ain't gonna like this... Bank of Blackstone... I made a mistake when I thought that your brother is innocent. And I was a fool to trust you. But the facts got me back on the road. Show me those dollars... What did you do, idiot ! In the back, like his brother Charlie ! Shut up ! His bullet proof vest saved him. Run and get the wagon, we'll take him into town. I swear to God, if someone moves, I kill him. I will not move. Who is it ? Hud... they got Hud. Strange... hard to believe that he was caught ... Virginia, my love. Come to bed. I want to prove you my manhood. You thought I could handle only the cards. Don't be silly... dress yourself. At your service ! The slave is always ready to obey his master. Sheriff, give us our money right away. It's our money. Hang Hud and give us our money. We want our money! - Open! Your money's safe enough. Don't worry. They will not calm down. They do not want money. They want me. - Do not move. Sheriff, what are you going to do ? We wait. Listen to me ! Silence! I will not tolerate any more disorder. Stop talkin shit and go home ! The money will be returned to the last penny. At the bank. - No ! At the bank ! Hud... ...I thought you were dead. Don't worry... ...if you ask for whom the bell tolls, it's not for me... Fortunately you are here, to enforce the law. They demand that you give back their money right away. They are right. The sooner, the better... this evening ? No it's impossible. We must first check the register. How long will it take? At least two days. But I will try to work quickly, overnight. Thank you, Mrs Pollicut, I appreciate your cooperation. I'll send my deputy over to watch the safe for you. You're such a marvellous man, Sheriff... Thank you. Would it be better, if you talk to them ? Of course. I... I go. - A moment. This champagne is for you. You deserve much more than this... ...please, for your good health. It's hard to believe, that the Great Hud, is sitting behind the bars. He deserves to be lynched like his brother. When our money's in our hands. that's when I'll breathe easily. It's safe at the bank. We should be on guard tonight. The Sheriff thought about it. Deputy is in the Bank with Virginia, until everything has been checked. Soon you will recover your money. Sheba... ...you can stay with me tonight. You should stay, you'll feel safer here. Made in France... I'd offer you a little, but you know...the rules. Seems stupid, cos I'm the one who made the rules. Yeah... besides that, ...there ain't enough here for us both. It's bitter. If the rich drink it... I never had a real bottle of champagne before. And all for me... you know why ? This is a reward... With a salary of 25 dollars... ...I could not afford champagne. Bottoms up ! Perhaps... now when the case is solved... I could go to Dallas... with a salary of... 40 or 45 dollars. Perhaps... ...I'm worth more... Hud... ...listen to me. Those donkeys can't put you in prison. There are no serious charges against you. And... I'll help you. Word! Hud, follow my advice... ...stop playing with the pistols. There's no point. Better use your brain... ...explain, find an agreement. Do you know what I'll do in Dallas? First of all... ...I will find myself a woman. Yes. I intend to get married. And have... two children... ...perfectly, as I say. But well, in my own way. Not like these four youngsters... who just hang out. Virginia! I hold him ! Quick ! Call the Sheriff ! Virginia, help! Come and lend me a hand! Go and get the coach! Sheriff ! Hey, Sheriff ! Hey ! Hey... what's the matter with you ? Wake up ! Forward... ...go ahead. Hold on... We are safe. You're a remarkable woman Virginia. The kind of woman... ...you meet once in a life. Oh...sorry. Let's spread the the money... on the ground and make love on them. It brings good luck. Stop playing comedy. I do not play comedy, I really love you. Doubly stupid. - Yes, stupid...stupid... Because I did not kill the deputy? I do not know how to kill, only love. Make me whatever you want. No ! Romero ! She wanted to burn them. If you burn them, they are false. If they are wrong, the real ones are hidden elsewhere. And you know where... POLLICUT BANK Open the bank! Dirty thieves! We've got to do something! Let's go and get the Sheriff. It's his fault, everything! Help ! El Diablo! Quick, hide yourself! El Diablo. He said he would come. Let's get sheltered. Sheriff, are you sleeping ? The bandits are in town. Wake up! Do something... hurry ! We need our guns'! Where is Hud? He's escaped. Escaped ! - It's your responsibility Sheriff! All is messed up ! What are we going to do now ? Citizens of this asshole... ...I ask, from the bottom of my heart. How could you be so stupid ? You've all been cheated... ...by a woman !I Pablo. Those dollars... ...are good just to... ...wipe your ass with. All are fakes ! This big slut is hiding the real ones. She fooled you all properly... We want the real ones. She will tell us where they are. Without torture, without violence. But... for love and with love. This bitch... ...will tell to us where she hid all the money. Because... we can't stop loving this slut... Romero! Pablo... muchachos... ...you are the first. No ! No ! Tasted shit... Why he's going out without weapons? Maybe, he doesn't believe in weapons. El Diablo, listen to me! Look... ...look carefully... I'm unarmed. I want to talk to you... man to man. Cos I know you are a man and I respect you. The shame of our city, is not your business. Let's keep it here. Don't lower yourself... - Look at the Sheriff... ...he's protecting... ...thieves and whores. If she's guilty, put her in the hands of the law. And the law is me. El Diablo knows only one law... ...this one. We like to make love, not to torture. Do you like it yourself, bitch ? My turn next... and there's fourteen guys waiting... Your time is ticking... You know ... ...you're near death... Speak... tell me the truth. Where's the real money ? What ? Still shooting ? My friend Hud... will find out where's the money... ...and the truth. Speak ! In the stove... in the stove! In my house ! - Tell the truth... ...high and loud ! Tell me about Charlie. In the front of all ! Charlie is innocent... I put... ...counterfeit money... instead of the real ones. I paid Boot for killing him. But Charlie managed to escape... ...and to hide the money... ...and to leave EIl Diablo that message for you. I could not imagine... that your brother will discover those fake dollars... never... Shoot, kill me. I'm bored with these farm boys and peasants. I hate you, and this damn city. I curse you. Hud! Now we're gonna fight... ...like in the old days ? Now we've got the same chance. Which one of us is faster with left hand. Chico, write... ...that this afternoon... ...El Diablo... ...the greatest revolutionary in Mexico... ...killed Hud... ...the greatest pistolero of all gringos... ...in a... ...a fair duel between friends... Write... ...write... that El Diablo... ...shot him... ...between the eyes... ...to defend the honor... ...of the wonderful Mexican people. Write everything! El Diablo! Diablo... Diablo... Chico... ...don't write the truth... ...write that El Diablo won... Come! ...come here everybody. He's burning our money. Come quickly ! My friend Hud is crazy... ...burning money ! Hurry, he burns the money! Stop it! Stop it! Do something! Bastard! How is he ? His pulse feels right, but he's losing blood. We must stop the bleeding. Let's call a doctor. He will not come for him. I'm going there. I will force him to come. Quickly ! Come on you pigs, or I kill you! You too ! Take off your hat! Dress up! We have the weapons, we are the ones who control. Rip off, I said and make it snappy ! Doctor! Doctor! There she is ! Come here. Take her. - No, leave me! We'll show you how we capable we are... You will see. We'll show you. Hud! We have the weapons! We want to confront you in a duel! Come and see what we have done. We don't scare you. Go out, and fight, if you have the courage. Otherwise, we will kill the entire city. Oh, it will be a massacre. It will be a pleasure to do so. We hold Sheba. Fight, if you care about her. You hear ? We are now the mighty ! You're not in shape... Hud ! Are you hiding under the skirts of the whores? Come on'! Where's your courage? I have to go. - Don't... ...you're hurt, badly. My gun...right now. It's empty. I have to stop them. No ! No! Don't move ! Go on! Fuck the ground... pigs... pigs... Look ! Shoot! With his damn iron jacket, he's untouchable... SUBS by NALLEKINO Parkstadt
