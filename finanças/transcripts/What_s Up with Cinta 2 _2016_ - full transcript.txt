So tell us, Mamet. Why on earth did you propose in leather pants? Because she's a big fan of Bon Jovi. It wasn't easy to find one, you know. Cinta. This is the rundown for later tonight. We start the exhibition at seven. How was the sound check? Went well. Mian will be back at six. I see. Let me check. Looks good! Thank you, Dinda. It will be great! What is it, Milly? First kick. Move over! Out of the way, husband! Where's Karmen? I really want her to feel the kick, too. What if she doesn't want to see us anymore? She knows that we're all here today, just for her. She will be here. Wait, Sorry. Just wondering, what was Karmen 'using'? Mamet! Karmen isn't a 'user'. She was just hanging out with the wrong crowd. Got caught the first time she tried. And was sent to rehab for 6 months. There she is! Karmen. Karmen! Sorry I'm so late. Milly, you're going to be a mother? - Yes, I miss you. - Congratulations! Listen up, everyone. I have two important announcements. First of all, Karmen. Welcome back. We all love you so much. And we're happy to have you back here with us again. Karmen, dear ... Maura, Milly and I have a special plan for all of us. Which is? Next month, I have to go to Yogyakarta. For the opening of Eko Nugroho's exhibition. Eko, who? There! See? I'm not the only one who doesn't know who Eko Nugroho is. Don't worry. I'll show you everything on the website. So you'll know. So, Karmen. After talking it over, ... we all agreed. This is the perfect time for us ... ... to go on a holiday to Yogyakarta together. We haven't spent time together for a while. And ... ... we've already ... bought your ticket. Really? Yes! Come on, Karmen, please. - Well. - Please ... Thank you so much. I'd be happy to go on holiday with you guys. Yay! Finally, holiday! What's with the face, Mamet? So it's a no man holiday or what? Let it go. Let them have fun. Before Milly gets too pregnant to travel. Yes, before Maura and Chris have their fourth kid. God no. Our home is already a mad house. One more won't hurt, right? Cinta. You said you had two announcements. - We heard the first one. - That's true. What's the second? What is it, Cinta? Let me announce the second one. So, ... last night ... I proposed to Cinta. And, she said ... Yes .... Let's have a toast! New York will not exist today. Neither will it tomorrow. I am alone. I am nowhere. Everyone is someone else. I embrace my own body. And love, ... you don't want me to turm off the light. The window is open. And the past comes within me like a wish. Shivers ... Shivers ... You are the fervour of my mind. You are ... the quiver of my memory. "Seasons change but my heart stays the same, I miss you." "Cinta, it's best we parted ... "Cinta, it's best we parted. You will find someone better than me. I'm sorry." Donna darling, would you be an angel and make me another espresso hot? You need to give me a raise, Roberto. What? For making me a cup of espresso? I thought you love me? Morning, Rob. Morning, Donna. Morning, Rangga. This is beautiful. This is beautiful. So deep and touching. What is? Your article, Rangga. From ... months ago. Have you been getting any sleep? Yeah. Donna, please make an espresso hot for Rangga. Rangga, you need to talk to your partner seriously. I need a raise. A raise? I thought you love us? But honestly man, you look terrible. I know you haven't been any sleep these past few weeks. What's wrong? I told you You should go out with that girl. - What's her name? - Sally! Yeah, Sally! She's so into you. Even Donna. I heard that, Roberto. I'm fine Rob. You're just being dramatic. Dramatic ? I've known you for years now. I am trully happy that we do this little business together. This is what you are. A writer. A great one. Rob, I don't want to talk about it. Talk about what? I'm just saying, ... you haven't been writing for ... ... sometime now. Here we go. You need to clear your head. Look, I'm ... kidding about Donna or Sally. OK. I know you got somebody else in your mind. Somebody far away. Take some time off, man. You've been thinking about going back to Jakarta for years. Go! Do whatever you have to do there. Whatever you need to settle. Donna and I can run the show here without you. Well, I ... really appreciate the thought my friend but ... really, I'm fine. I'll write again soon. Let's open up. Hey, good morning. Good morning. Rangga? Yes, that's right. I'm sorry, who are you? I'm Sukma. I'm your half-sister. I still can't believe I have a sister. Are you still in school? Yes. I'm studying economics, fourth semester. My father passed away last year. Mother lives with me now. Where are Rudi and Dewi? Rudi has lived in Sydney for the past 10 years. His wife is Australian, and they have two kids. Dewi has three kids. She teaches and lives in Solo. Mother has never forgotten you. She was the one who left. Physically, she's well. But she's often moody. She just cries for no reason. Sometimes she rambles. She often asks ... why you haven't come home yet. If you are still out riding your bicycle. Brother ... I came here of my own will. For two years, I've been trying to find out where you are. And finally, I decided to come to New York. Dewi and Rudi paid for my trip. These past four days I visited ... ... Columbia and NYU to find information. After I met your belated father's friend. Professor Richardson. I finally got the address of your caf?. You shouldn't have bothered looking for me. I'm here to ask you to meet Mother. I think there's something you need to hear from her, yourself. Why she hasn't been in contact with you all this time. For twenty years I've lived without a mother. And I have no problem with that, Sukma. But you have a mother! How much longer will you pretend she doesn't exist? Listen, Sukma. It's up to you how you want to see it. But I really do feel I've never had a mother. We miss you, Alya. I'm sorry Alya. I let you all down. You haven't let anyone down. It's okay, Karmen. Alya. we have to go now. We're going on a trip to Yogyakarta. Bye, Alya. Give me a moment. Tatto your eyebrow. - No. Curl your lashes. - Don't do any of that! But I need to know, is it okay? - Guys, enough. I'm driving here. - So just drive. Enough. Please. All of you. Please, take good care of my pregnant wife. Mamet, you just relax. I have a triple degree in pregnancy. The second trimester is the safest for travelling. I already told you, but you didn't believe me. Okay, fine. Enough. Let's just sing together. Why suddenly sing? Stop! I'm serious. Do you guys remember this song? "Remember friends when we dreamed together" - Which song is that? - Oh, I know! "and run together to make it reality." "All the isolation along the way." I remember this song! This was back when you were in love with me, right? [ See "Ada Apa Dengan Cinta 1" ] - No way! It wasn't like that. - Admit it! Cinta, you got it all wrong. Cinta : Denial! I was only acting like I liked you. Seriously? My heart has always been for Milly. Wow, Yogyakarta! I haven't been here in years. So how did you find this villa, Cinta? Found it online. Miss, so you want to drive the car yourself? Yes, Mr. Boncel. It has GPS, right? Of course. This place is so cute. It's great, right? There are two rooms. We can decide together the sleeping arrangements. Our schedule for the next four days is settled, OK? Let's not go to the temples. So Milly doesn't have to walk up the stairs. The most important thing is, tomorrow we eat gudeg for breakfast. That is a must. Maura. What are you doing? I just can't stand to see all this mess. Guys, please put the trash away, okay? Karmen, your shoes look so gross. Like you haven't washed them in three weeks. But they're outside. Maura, give it a rest. We're on holiday. The shoes are fine. - The maid will clean up later. - What would you do with that pillow? - Shall I throw this away? - Put it down. You guys are disgusting. This is iRadio Indonesia. - Today is so hot. - Indeed. Let us update you on this morning's traffic. What are you looking for? Enough already, it's hot. Karmen, wait please. Wait for me. Why do we have to be in here? Watch out Milly, watch out! Sweet iced tea! Remember the good old cafetaria? We're not in high school, guys. No, thank you. Hot tea for me. - Hot tea on a hot day? - Not too hot. Where to, Sir? Can you take me to this address? Can I help you? Does Cinta still live here, Ma'am? There's no one by that name here. Thank you. You're welcome. I am diving into an old sorrow ... ... that lives happily within the verses of Pablo Neruda. I am diving into a deep lagoon. And I am transfixed upon your face. Rickshaw, Sir? Do you have a name ready for the baby? Actually, yes. If it's a girl, I want to name her ... Alya. If it's a boy, name him Andrew. No, I don't want that kind of names. I want something more Indonesian. Oh, I see. Like Mamet. Like Mamet? How about Tarjo? No, not that. Let's give Karmen the gift now. What gift? You already bought my plane ticket. And now a gift too? Karmen. This is ... a token of our love for you. So you always remember ... that we are all here for you. Please take it. I don't need reminding, really. I know that you all love me. Open it. Do you like it? We designed it especially for you. I love it, thank you. Let's have a look. It's nice, right? I love you guys. We love you too. By the way, let me shop for some snacks real quick. I saw a minimart nearby. I'll go. It's my turn now. You guys bought me a ticket, and bought me a gift. Okay, in that case. I'll come with you. But we'll walk, okay? Just take the car. It's what it's there for. Maura just added something to her list. Where can we buy it? I saw a bakery near here. Let's walk. Is it far? Nope! Just over there. It's good to walk a little. We'll buy ice cream later. Let's buy ice cream now. I want that tropical fruit bread. - One? - Two. That's him, right? There he is! Over there! Milly, don't! Milly?! We don't want to be recognized, right? What should we do? We tell Cinta. Karmen. For what? Have you forgotten ... how Rangga broke up with Cinta? Through a letter! She was devastated. True. She was a mess. She couldn't eat, couldn't sleep, and wouldn't leave her room. What should we do now? This is like fate. It's strange coincidence, don't you think? We are here and Rangga is also here. Plus, Milly and I saw him. Good point. You mean it's like a sign from the universe? Yes. Then why wasn't it Cinta who saw him? Why the two of you? Also a good point. I don't want to keep this secret from Cinta. It's not fair for her. I've felt what she felt. Being left without explanation. Feels horrible. Even though in the end I know In my case there was another woman. Maura. I think ... Karmen has a point. I mean ... Cinta will marry Trian soon. Wouldn't it be better ... ... if ... she got an explanation from Rangga? So that ... she has some closure. Right? It's precisely because Cinta's going to marry Trian. Why should we meddle? If only Alya was here, she would agree with me. Okay then. So how do we do it? We still have to be careful. If we do tell Cinta ... ... but then Rangga doesn't want to meet her, then what? What if Rangga is here with his wife? And they're on their honeymoon? Hello? Guest? He really wants to see you. In Jakarta, he stopped by your old house. Of course, the old house. What else did he say? He said that after he is done in Yogyakarta ... He is going to look for you in Jakarta. If you don't want to, that's also okay. Right? Yes, if that's your choice. That's right. Right. In my opinion ... What is important is you. Whatever you think is best. For you, for Karmen, for Maura. What? Sorry, I'm really not focused right now. But you understand, right? - You got it, right? - Just have a drink first, it's okay. Cinta. Whatever you decide ... We will support you. He disappears for nine years. Now he suddenly shows up and wants to explain? So strange. I don't get it. No, I'm not seeing him. Right? Why should we ... ... dig up problems that have long been buried? Right? To me, now he's like ... ... an archive. If he's an archive, that means you still keep it? In that case, not an archive. A relic. Something so old that people don't know where it is anymore. In the museum, right? ??? Karmen. You tell him ... ... that I don't want to see him. And ... as for us ... We continue with our holiday. How about it? Holiday! Let's order dessert! Nothing. I just miss you. What are you doing? Cinta! Picture time! Oh, okay. I'll call you later. Bye. Cinta, come on! Let's capture this moment. Watch where the sun is. I'll stay here. Excuse me, I'm sorry to interupt you. Hello, Eko. I'm Cinta from Jakarta. Can I get your autograph? Oh, sure. I have your book here. Where should I sign? - Here. - Okay. What is this? What's the idea behind it? Let's take a step back ... .. to get the bigger picture. From here, like this. I still don't get it. Milly. You still don't get it? It's an art installation. This is art. Forget it, you're a lost cause. Karmen. What did you do? Cinta. It's been too long. Yes. Too long. I know you don't want to see me. Then why are you here? This brooding look used to be cute with you. Now it's just pissing me off. Cinta, I apologize. I'm leaving early. I have my reason. Cinta. Think about it. Can you really marry Trian ... .. if you haven't had a closure with Rangga? Karmen. This is just about a man. Maybe you want your husband back. Me? I don't need Rangga anymore. If your life is messed up ... ... because your husband left you hanging. Doesn't mean I'm going to end up like you. Are you guys waiting for me? Afraid I'll overdose? Karmen. Please forgive me. I didn't mean to hurt you at all. I was wrong. And everything you said was true. And because I knew you were right ... I got mad. We experienced the same thing. But I was luckier. You were all there for me. But when you were going through yours, ... we were all busy with ourselves. I was the one who disappeared. None of you did anything wrong. About me using drugs. There's no one to blame. I chose the wrong friends. I left you all. Forgive me, Karmen. I'm sorry too. So, tomorrow morning ... I will see Rangga. I'll just take a taxi. The car needs to be on standby for Milly. I don't think I will be long. one or two hours at most. In the afternoon, as planned. We do our culinary tour and buy souvenirs. At night we eat at Bu Ageng. The day after tomorrow ... ... we go home together. Please. So? So ... Cinta. I understand ... If I say 'forgive me' ... ... it's not enough. So true. What I did to you was unfair. Unfair, you say? Rangga, what you did to me ... .. was cruel. I had no idea what I did wrong. You did nothing wrong. It's not you. It's me. That is the biggest clich? ... .. used by people who want to end things, ... ... but don't have guts to say the reason. Before we start ... Let me explain why I finally want to see you. So you don't get the wrong idea. I am here. .. not because I still have feelings for you. .. nor because I want to mend our relationship. The matter of you and I has long been forgotten. It's not important for me anymore. I assume it's the same for you, right? I admit. For many years I thought ... the distance didn't get in our way. Finally, my family and I could go on vacation to New York. And we could meet again. We were the happiest couple in the world at that time. Cinta ... I'm not finished. Then I returned to Jakarta. Suddenly you started to change. I felt you drifting away from me. Less emails, less texts. You stopped answering my calls. Then I got that letter from you. I was such a fool. I received your letter with a big smile. I thought, how romantic ... ... to still get a letter from a boyfriend nowadays. I thought you'd written me a poem. It turned out ... I want to explain. Wait. This is important. For years I was ... heartbroken. If not for Alya ... Karmen ... Maura and Milly ... ... my life, my school ... ... would have all fallen apart. Back to why I want to see you now. This is not for me. It's for them. They feel I need an explanation from you. So I can start my new life with Trian. You're engaged? Are you married? No. You can speak now. I'll try to explain everything. But let's walk. When you and your family came to New York ... I felt you and your family were so good to me. Was that wrong? Not at all. Your family is perfect. Stable. What do you mean? I don't understand. What does that have to do with us? I was only 23 years old. My life in New York was not easy. My father has passed away. I had to finish college ... ... while doing odd jobs here and there. This conversation is going nowhere. You're telling me things I already know. Cinta. Please give me time to explain. When I took you to go to the airport ... Your father whispered to me ... He said, "Rangga." "When you finish college ..." ".. hurry back to Jakarta to find work." "DON'T make Cinta wait too long." "I feel sorry for her." My father said that? And? What I didn't tell you was ... ... my studies were a mess. After you went back to Jakarta ... I thought ... I would never make you happy. Make you wait for years. Until my life gets back on track. So in the end ... I thought it was best if we broke up. I would only weigh you down. According to whom? According to you, right? We never talked about this at all. Or maybe you're lying? There must be someone else. and you don't have the guts to tell me. Cinta, there was no one else. Then why did you leave me in the dark for nine years? Why now? You're selfish! Again, don't get me wrong. I don't want this to look like a lover's quarrel. You and I are done. I'm sorry. I got carried away by old emotions. I shouldn't be angry anymore. Truce, all right. We're both adults after all. We're not in high school anymore. What's done is done. Everything is clear ... now. I should get back to my friends. Goodbye, Rangga. At least, let me help you find a taxi. Please. Okay. Thank you. I'm sorry. I've never done anything like that in my whole life. Feels strange. It's okay. Does it hurt? A little. How long will you be in Yogyakarta? Until tomorrow morning. I haven't asked ... Why are you in the city? My mother. Your mother? - Didn't she ...? - Yes. Long story. Do you want to hear it? I'd be really happy if you want to hear the story. You know what? This Rangga and Cinta thing is like ... I know! There's a saying for it. Like a soap opera. Yes. That's what I meant. Never ending. It's Trian ... You answer. No, I don't want to. Don't! I don't know what to say. Just let it ring. It will stop by itself. See? This is all because of me. I feel bad. It's Cinta. She said she's not done yet. There's more. "You guys should go ahead." "I'll meet you for dinner." Another message from Cinta. "If Trian calls ..." "... don't answer." It's getting hot here. Why are you laughing? Let's just swim! The water's nice. The car's over there. Come on! Where are you abducting me? Just to tell me about your mother. You have to rent a car? If we take a motorbike, your hair will get messed up. You're so annoying. Turn the car around, just take me back. It's not far. I'm sure you've never been there before. Say what? I visit Yogyakarta more often than you. [ Ratu Boko Temple ] Why did you suddenly think of this place? The last time I was here was in high school. This was my father's favorite place. Your late father ... ... was such a cool person. You must miss him a lot. How is your family? Everyone well? Yes. They're well. I have two nieces now. Turns out I have five. What? That's a lot. Why haven't you moved back to Indonesia? Didn't you get homesick? My heart is always here. I always vote in elections. Really? Who'd you vote for last year? I think we voted for the same person. I think so too. Are you disappointed? How much is this one? Milly, come on. It's getting late. Just a minute. What are you doing? Sending a text to Rangga. Saying what? If the messes up with Cinta, ... I'll smack him! Why are you laughing? Nothing. It's good to see you back to your old self. Fierce. Ferocious. Shall I send it or not? No need. I'm sure there's enough tension there already. Let's go! Sexual tension! Rangga. If I can make peace with you, ... you should also make peace with your mother. I think so too. What I did to you is no different than ... ... what my mother did to me. Disappeared without any explanation. Are you hungry? Where on earth is Cinta? She isn't answering our texts. Thank you. The menu is here. Cinta is not. Where is she? What time is it now? What are they discussing? I know. I'm worried now. Nothing we can do now. Let's just order. Let's do that. I hope Cinta doesn't forget to eat. Poor her. You're a columnist at a prestigious magazine, ... yet you still work as a barista? and waiter, ... dishwasher, ... accountant. How about you? You're a big boss now at your gallery. No way! My gallery is small ... ... if you can call that a gallery. I have only three employees. It's more like ... .. a place for young people who like literature, ... arts, ... and performing arts to gather. Sometimes we have workshops, ... exhibitions, ... and small performances. Wow. What you're doing isn't small. It's important. I am so happy to hear it. You're doing something you love. What about poetry? Do you still write poems? I'm writing a book. It's poetry and photography. Wow. But I can't seem to finish the book. What about ... ... a girlfriend? Hard to believe you have no girlfriend all this time. We broke up a long time ago. About two years ago. What was she like? She was like you. Huh? In what way? What way? No. I made a mistake. She wasn't you. Come on. Why? Are your friends looking for you? Oh my God! I promised to meet them for dinner. Why? Are you laughing at my friends again? No. Hurry up and call them. You're full and they're starving. Karmen, I'm sorry. We're not finished yet. I'll tell you later. You guys just go back to the villa. I'll tell you all about it. I'm so sorry. Thank you. You already paid? Your treat? I'm doing all right now. I have a little bit of money. They weren't mad, were they? No, they understand. I'm so sorry ... ... to hear about Alya's accident. Must've been really hard on you? Yes. When did that happen? Five years ago. I have to say now. I was wrong about you and your friends. [ See "Ada Apa Dengan Cinta 1" ] Your friendship is so sincere. Finally, an acknowledgement. You're so happy when I'm wrong. So, your friends are no longer waiting for you? They've ... already eaten ... ... and are going back to the villa. [ Papermoon Puppet Theatre ] [ Title : A cup of coffee from Playa ] My friends need to see this. So beautiful! Does Trian ... like to watch performances like that? Now it's my turn to ask. Not really. He's the kind of guy that ... ... likes to work hard. Ambitious ... ... in a positive way. Young entrepreneur? He must be born rich, right? I've spent the whole day with you. And I thought you have changed. Let me go home now. Cinta. I'm sorry. I don't know why those words came out. You're full of apologies. What are you doing? I have to go back. If this is the last time we see each other ... ... and now is the only time we have. I beg you. Don't let us part with anger. We were already at peace. You're the one who messed it up. I know. My bad. I'm sorry. Can we make up again? If you say yes, I will give you gift. See, I'm used to your cynical self. But ... Where did this sweet talker suddenly come from? What's the gift? I can't give a gift in a car. Fine, but this time I pick the place. - Pepeng, how are you? - How are you, Cinta? I'm good. I want the one I had last time. I really liked that. - From Farmer Nur? - Right! The latest batch is honey processed. - Really? - It's sweeter. I want that. - You can't find it anywhere else. - Oh, really? What about you? I'll have the same. He's never been here. A beginner, huh? Not really. But make sure he gets the whole story. Okay. I'll wait outside. Hold it, Bro. Do you like coffee? Yes. What kind? Just long black. Got it! We have all kinds of black coffee. Just black coffee. No milk, no sugar. Just coffee. Let's talk coffee. We have the best beans from all over Indonesia. What's this? That's Yellow Cattura from Bajawa. Other beans when they're riped, they turn red. This one turns yellow. That's our final roast today. Okay. I'll take this one. Grind it, Bro. Wait, Bro. Come here. I'll tell you a story. Our beans come straight from the farmers. We process it, like this. We work together with the farmers. processing, fermenting, dying. This is the result. Here. smell this. Good, right? One plantation can do many things. Natural process, semi-washed, depends on the process. All right then. Depends also on the location. If it's dry land ... ... they can use the natural process. It's really simple. The concept here, we chat about it. We don't have a menu. He's okay, that guy. - So serious. - There it is. The cynic's back! No. I want to ... write about him. But ... But? It's just, the timing. I am here to talk with you. Not with him. You did that on purpose, didn't you? Sneaky girl. So ... Where's my gift? I wrote this for you on the plane. On the way to Jakarta. Don't read it now. Read it later when I'm not around. Okay. Thank you. Cinta. Yes. Have you ever been to Punthuk Setumbu? Punthuk Setumbu? Let's go there after this! After this? Rangga. It's already past midnight. And your friends are already asleep. We might never see each other again. Oh, no. What does this mean? "Guys, I just want to let you know, ..." "I'm fine, but not finished yet." "Don't wait up for me." "Might be out until dawn." "Don't worry." "I will tell you the full story later." Until dawn? That's a long time away! What will she be doing until dawn? It's so dark. Scary. Just go slowly. We're close. What is this place? We'll see when the sun rises. Soon. Do you know this place ... ... or ... ... just guessing? I know ... ... a little. I'm just feeling my way. What? You're crazy. That's reckless. That's the difference between travellers ... ... and tourists. Let's sit here. What's the difference? The thing with tourists, ... ... they follow a set of schedule. They stay somewhere comfortable. They go where it's good for taking pictures. Of course! It's called a holiday. But when we travel, ... ... we have to be spontaneous. Take risks. Be ready for possibilities. Just enjoy the process ... ... and the surprises that might turn up along the way. The important thing is ... ... the journey, not the destination. Right? It's time. Is that ... the building where we had a chat? Yes. Come with me. Up there. Rangga. Worth staying up all night, right? So ... this is travelling? This is travelling. This is it. Cinta. Yes. Again. Forgive me. I truly regret hurting you. It's hard for me not to forgive you. I'm happy we can still be friends. Good luck with your mom. Take care. You too. Cinta! Gosh! Where have you been? We couldn't sleep, waiting for you. Thanks. I don't know where to begin. Is he ... married? Have you gotten closure? Not yet. What? No closure yet? Ask one at a time. Okay, the first one ... No. He's not married. The second one ... Yes. I have my closure. At first we were fighting. But after that, we made up. We talked a lot. Went to a few different places. Telling stories. Just catching up, you know. And? Why did he disappear nine years ago? Be patient. I'll give you all the details later. Now I need to take a shower. And I haven't even packed yet. It's done. Already packed. Maura was nervous. She didn't want you to be late. So we packed up your bag. We hope that's okay. Thank you so much. I'll have a shower now. I forgot to ask you guys to get souvenir for Trian. Relax. We picked something out. Bought it and chipped in. You guys really are ... the best. The best. She didn't even ask what we bought for Trian? That's true. But we're ... the best. Big mistake. Bye, Cinta. Bye, Maura. Thank you. - Bye, Trian. - Bye, Maura. The food was so good! That's nice. I've probably put on a few pounds. You're perfect. You look tired, though. Rangga! Come in! I knew it. I knew you'd come. Mother is in her room. She's quite healthy today. Wait here. Rangga is here. Rangga. Dewi. Rangga is here. He's meeting Mother. Can you come here? The airport and skies ... ... separates New York and Jakarta. The disquiet in your chest ... ... and the secrets that wait in the soul of this verse ... ... are seperated by words. So is longing. An oceans between a home and a lost wanderer. A father who tears a child from his mother ... ... or the other way round. Or your smile is ... ... the wall between my sanity and my self. How are you today? Look at that question mark. It is the precipice between my foolishness and my longing ... ... to belong to you again. Babe. There's something I want to tell you ... about Yogyakarta. Sorry, Babe. One minute. "Cinta, I'm coming to Jakarta tonight. Can I see you one more time?" Sorry, Babe. What were you saying? About Yogyakarta? I want to tell you about ... ... Eko Nugroho's exhibition. Good thing I didn't come. I would've been as clueless as Milly. Karmen. Do you have yoga tomorrow? So, why did you join me in class today? Is Rangga still on your mind? It's not that. It just bugs me that I haven't told Trian ... .. that Rangga and I met in Yogyakarta. I mean, he knows all my history. But about what happened in Yogyakarta ... How should I tell him? Actually, you haven't even told us yet. What really happened between you and Rangga in Yogyakarta. You don't have to tell us all the details. But ... I have to ask you one thing. Are you really sure that Trian is the one you love? Trian and I are getting married. That wasn't the question, Cinta. We're leaving now. Sure. Trian will be here soon. Thank you. Okay. See you tomorrow. But we're closed. It's all right, Dinda. Rangga. What are you doing here? I already told you. We mustn't see each other again. I know I made a big mistake. I hurt you. I left you. And I don't know how many times I've cursed myself over that mistake. And I should be thankful that you have forgiven me ... ... and you are willing to be friends with me again. But I have to be honest. I want us to be more than that. If you think we still have a second chance, ... I will cancel my flight. Rangga. I'm getting married. Tell me that what happened in Yogyakarta didn't mean anything to you. Rangga, ... that kiss ... ... was a mistake. And it means nothing to me. Okay. It's all clear now. That's why you've been acting so strange lately. The legendary Rangga has waltzed back into your life? It's pure coincidence, Trian. Nothing was planned. He was there in Yogyakarta. You met him in Yogyakarta? We met ... briefly. - I've been wanting to tell you. - When? And how long is briefly? Cinta. I met with him. I was waiting for the right time to explain everything to you. Just not like this. Tell me now. I have the right to know. From the window, you watch the days you have saved ... ... one by one. You watch how they bid you ... farewell. Sometimes it is easier to love everyone ... ... than to forget someone. If there is already someone who touches the core of your heart. Those who come hereafter ... ... will touch nothing but more chances. Are you okay, Miss? Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. ONE MONTH LATER - Please tell Roxy that I stop by. - Yeah, no problem. - Thank you. I think you should be the one to tell her. - You want ... me? - Yup. Okay. Donna. On behalf of Rangga and I serious consideration, ... .. we decided to give you a raise. - Really? - Yeah. - Seriously? - Seriously. Oh my God. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you so much. - You're welcome. You deserve it. - Thank you. Cinta. It's okay. Cinta. Cinta. Sorry Rangga. I was such a fool. I never thought ... Never crossed my mind that you already have someone else. No. No, Cinta. She's my employee. I just gave her a raise. She's happy. So ... she hugged me. You're here. Yes. I'm here. So? So ... I have to explain to you. The last time we met ... .. when you came to the gallery ... I lied. Everything I said to you ... ... wasn't true. Rangga ... Something happened to me that made me realize ... Life can end at anytime. And I ... I can never imagine my life ... ... without you. I love you. I love you too. Doesn't suit you yet, bro. Give me back my baby. The end. English subtitles by Rizal Iwan & Angie Kilbane Poetry translated by Rain Chudori.
