54.6 million kilometers. That's the distance between the Earth and Mars. Travelling this distance of 54.6 million kilometers and reaching Mars is my only aim. Light travels at a speed of 300,000 kilometers in a second. Man's thought is faster than that. That is how, saints used to time travel in ancient times. I am going to do the same. Scientifically. People laugh if I say this. Would they have laughed at me had I said I want to be like Virat Kohli or Sundar Pichai? They laughed at my father as well. But he never bothered. He ignored everything and kept moving on. The first time, my dad told me we were going to Mars, I was super excited. Are you scared? I'm a little scared, dad. - Come. I just don't want to leave you alone on earth and go. Can we definitely go to mars? We'll definitely go. No rocket is needed, nor is any equipment required. My dad firmly believed, one can travel to mars using one's brain. My dad is a genius. But nothing happened. My legs started aching, standing for so long. I couldn't ask my dad why did we fail to go to Mars? That's because, I knew the question would hurt him. But my mind said, there is some truth in my dad's words. Twenty years! Like a robot, dad kept doing this experiment, standing at the same place. Dad, shall we go? I understand your anger. I have already narrated the story of Ravan's Pushpaka Vimanam. Whenever Ravan wished... - His Pushpak Plane appeared. And it took him to any place he desired to reach. That's because, it was Ravan's thoughts that controlled it. We can travel through our thoughts. Right? I am bored. We've been going to that hill since twenty years. You've been trying the same experiment since then. And you have been failing in it. Not twenty years, even if it takes a 100 years, it will happen. Because, it's a fact. So then where did you go wrong? One should have patience, Akash. Instead of going to that hill, had you visited Sabarimala for 20 years, you would've at least become a Guruswamy. Two weeks back, didn't you tell me you solved the equation? Yes, I did. We partied back then. Let's party again. I really solved it this time. Really? - I solved it. Did you? I solved the equation that my dad couldn't for all these years. You solved the equation? He will wake up to the solved equation tomorrow. He'll be happy. He will be happy. He will be highly elated. He'll be highly elated. He will be highly elated. He will be extremely happy. He will be extremely happy. He'll be very happy. He will be highly elated. He'll be so happy. He will be extremely happy. Your best friend Anand... His mom has complained that he's missing since 3 days. You were last seen with him. Where's Anand? 'He will be extremely happy.' This is a de-addiction center. You were half dead when you were found after a drug overdose. Your dad got you here. Where is Anand? Is today Monday or Tuesday? Answer my question, first. Where is Anand? Mister, do you know who sir is? He is Thiruparkadal Kannan. Missing case expert. His question... - I am talking. Do you see this coin? What if I do? What now? It isn't visible. - Right? You can't see the coin. This is called refraction. It is true that the coin is not visible. That doesn't mean, there's no coin. Similarly, you are looking for Anand in a place he isn't. Anand is definitely there. But he isn't here. He is in some other place. Same incident can happen in different places at the same time. A Thirupakadal Kannan like you can be investigating elsewhere like you. That's called Quantum Physics. Do you believe I'm guilty? Do you? That's quite obvious, sir. Never mind, sir. But at least believe the words of an accused. Believe in me. I would not be talking to you if I was guilty. I would've gone elsewhere. It's simple, sir. Won't it reflect in my eyes if I lied? Won't you see it in my eyes? Look into my eyes, sir. Now, ask me anything. Fraud. Fraud. He is a fraud, sir. You have rightly identified him. But it is of no use. He is very confident that you can do no harm to him. That is why, he is doing all this. You have this medicine. I've been taking this every day. I don't think it is working. My anxiety seems to have increased. Sir, what did the physician tell you? The medicine will show its result only after 90 days. It's been only two months, sir. Isn't that too early to decide? You are right. They are frauds. - Correct, sir. No one can fool you. Except me. - What? I said, 'exactly'. Your phone is ringing. Answer it. It's your wife. This is the 6th call since morning. She is complaining, you beat her up every night once you're drunk. Why do you drink every day? 'Are you questioning me?' 'I will make sure, you are driven mad for this.' This is fate, sir. We need to meet the pastor. Velu, what you do is... Hey, why are you standing there? Are you father-son duo trying to fool me? Let's see for how long will this continue. Do you have a proof that my son did this? Proof, is it? Are you asking me for proof? I investigated. Not a single person had a good opinion about your son. When I met you last time, I told you everything that I knew, without keeping any secret. I have nothing new to say. May I go? What did he tell you, sir? He said, it's cake! Did he say that? I will tell you the truth, sir. It's true that I went to Anand's room that day. But we did drugs and danced there. I swear in the name of God. I really don't know about Anand. Those two fools thought, I'd say something like this. They couldn't even look into my eyes and speak. They were staring as if they made some mistake. You should have looked at the SI's face. Akash, try to recall what happened that night and tell me. I'll see our lawyer and find out what can be done. This is your problem. If you were a passionate scientist, you would've called and appreciated me for I solved the equation. I solved the equation, mentioned the co-ordinates and gave you. 10.4489 degre North. 77.5209 degree East. Are you pointing at Palani? I mean to say, the location you chose to go to Mars was wrong. Akash, you're an astro-physics student. How can you be so sure that it's Palani? The Earth and Mars comes in line at such short distance only once in twenty years. Correct? - Correct. That is going to happen in the next 14 days, you agree? You must be here, Akash. - Listen... If I miss this line-up now, I'm not sure when this will happen again. Can you say when it will happen? It was your turn, twenty years ago. Now, it is my turn. I will do it. My new room-mate? Hi. I'm Andava Perumal. Oh, I see. You are new to this place, aren't you? I visit here often. I will give you some tips as to how you should stay here. I am talking to you. You turned around and slept! Hey, I am talking to you. Andava Perumal... If I beat him, I'll be the one in trouble. Relax. Relax... (Song) Raga Gambhiranata. (Song) This is Natai. (Song) (Song) (Song) Jayantashree. Sir, pour it. We need to finish by evening. Physician, how many pots did you ask him to pour? 108. You have no sense at all. Couldn't you have told him at least 1008 or 5008? I cannot say just anything. If more water is poured over his head, he'll catch cold. Is that so? The reason I am asking you is, you told me that if I give him your medicine for three months, he will lose his mental balance. I've been giving it to him since two months. There's no result as expected. Isn't he feeling more anxious? That's not enough, he should burst. If that happens, he will die immediately. And then you will land in jail. There are two cases pending in your name. Out of which the Sugandi murder case is quite strong. Beware. How will it be if Simbu becomes the CM? He sounded really upset over the phone yesterday. He wanted to be the CM tomorrow itself. But how is that possible? Tomorrow is Sunday. There was a chance if it was Monday or Tuesday. Oh! They don't let me be in peace even for two minutes. They keep calling. Sir, you are handling this case. Then how did Sir Pandian hear about Anand's dead body even before you knew? That is what I am wondering. I'm constantly trying to reach, but he isn't answering his phone. Disconnect it, sir. Why? - If you call him now, he'll ask you to come straight to the police station So what? - If you go there, in front of everyone else, he'll take you to task. Is that needed? What do you suggest? Before he goes there, let us find out his current whereabout and go, fall on his feet right there. Okay, let's go to the station. I'll fall on his feet. Who out of these two is Mr Pandian? Sorry, sir. We couldn't catch Anand alive, despite all our efforts. We've informed his family. Are you not ashamed of yourself? Seven people! If you cannot load 300 gunny bags in two trucks, why are you there? Hang up, I'll be there. Sir, wash your face and go. Washing is what they do over there. You said, he was Mr Pandian. I was about to say that he isn't the one, but you jumped into a conclusion. What is it? I thought you'd catch Anand alive, but you got him dead. Give me a towel. No, sir. Actually... What is it? Yes, sir. Anand... Yes or no? Stick to one answer Sir... Since he has been chasing this case for long, he is in a confused state of mind, sir. That is not true, sir. I am fine. We even consulted a local herbalist for this problem. What does a herbalist got to do in this case? - Sir... He is not an expert only in medicines, but also in other practices using a betel leaf for predictions. Heard it? A betel leaf for prediction? He used the betel leaf trick and told us straight that Akash has committed this murder. He has already confirmed it to him, sir. Did he use a betel leaf to find out Akash committed the murder? Yes, sir. - So, the Sundar Rajan case has been delayed for too long. Will he find that murderer too? He will, if we ask him to, sir. Why are you in the police department? You don't deserve it. I will give you 48 hours. I want the real culprit. Got it? Find the person who is actually behind this and close the case. Otherwise, your VRS, your pension, you can forget everything. Explain it to him. No... Why did you have to narrate that story of betel leaf? - Sir... When he asked about Sunder Rajan, why did you agree unnecessarily? You are the one who put it in our mind. I have a doubt, sir. What is it? Did he really need a facial for this ugly face? In the end, I am not a part of the band I formed. Like you said, I do drugs and in a high, thrash up a few people during every show of mine. All of you are defamed because of me. - No... No, listen to me. - Each one of you. Suppose, there's a show tomorrow. We're going to do a show, tomorrow. Without me? No, let me finish. For example, there's a show tomorrow. You will perform without me? - No, hear me out first. Okay? We're doing a show tomorrow. Like this, you come out. Okay? How can we be sure, you won't do this once out? Psycho... You are a psycho. Am I a psycho? Why are you beating me up? Beat him up. Why only me? Beat him as well. Why are you beating me alone? I should not have come. Looks like, you came to tell me not to come here. Hey, go and sit elsewhere. Hey! I am a senior here. You may change your place. This is what happens when one has more calories in one's body. One gets too hyper. You want to go to the South and bang your head? That will reduce 150 calories. 150 calories! It's a science fact. It's people like you who have more chances of attempting suicide. I can see that in your eyes. You will hang yourself to death in this same room... Yes. That pastor is responsible for all of this. He will die at my hands. It's confirmed. Suicide... Shall we flee from here? Should the two of us escape from here? Trusting you? Who else can you trust other than me? Shall we kill that pastor and flee? What do you say? Really? Really? Sir, those boys stole my bike. What color? What model was it? - 2005, sir. Was the tyre new? - I recently changed those. What's its mileage? 40 kms, sir. - Wait here. Sir... Sir. His bike is missing too... - Please, track it down. - Wait, I'm talking to him. He says, those two boys stole it. He also says, it gives 40 kms per litre mileage. It was blessed by the pastor. Do you have any sense? Sir is already worked up for not being able to find them. Mr Pandian just humiliated him. And you're complaining about your missing bike. Go away, sir. Sir... Sir... Mr Pandian told you to forget about your pension and VRS forever. What does that mean, sir? Vadapazhani, Tiruthani, Tiruchendur, Lord Murugan's temples are in all these places too. Why do you insist on going to Palani itself? - Hey! I am not going to Palani to visit Lord Muruga's temple. So then? According to Science, the only place where Mars' 70% power reflects on Earth is Palani. Have many people gone to Mars from Palani temple already? You won't understand. So explain to me. Do you know the power of human thoughts? - Assume that I do. In this whole universe, human thoughts travels faster than light. Do you get it? How will you understand? I am thinking of being at a wine shop now. Why am I not there? I need to reach... Ride faster. He is my son, sir. I am more concerned about him, than you are. Don't call and disturb me so often. Do you understand? I will inform you immediately if he comes. I came to take my spacesuit. I'll leave once I take it. You have no patience, Akash. You wait and see. You won't go to Mars, but instead land in jail. I was there for ten days. You thought of coming to see me only once. Your plan was to retain me there for three months. Why would I be happy to send you there? I did that for your good. You are jealous, dad. You couldn't do what you aimed at, for twenty long years. The second day after I solved the equation, you put me in a de-addiction center. I realized your true color right then. Sir... I have just one question. How far is Mars from Palani? - Are you accompanying him? Actually, I have met you. At the de-addiction center. You came to meet him there. I'm Andava Perumal. Hey... Let's go. Akash, keep this cell phone with you. What for? Should I call to inform you once I reach Mars? Come, let us go. He won't take the phone, just inform your whereabouts regularly. You gave me only the phone. I need to take your son all the way to Palani. Here, take this as well. Will you transfer online once this money is over? Tell me. How will you send more once this is over? Shall we go, sir? Sir, why did you slap me now? Why did I slap you? Two of them escaped on a bike right in front of you. Instead of catching them, you're standing idle here. Who went, sir? There's no one. Akash and Andava Perumal just left from here. Sir, no one went from there. Look, the road is isolated. Look over there, you can still the smoke emitted by the bike. This is what happened in an English movie wherein a Mathematics teacher... How am I related to a math teacher? You are. He was as brilliant as you. But he saw things no one else could. Do you see this jeep? Sir, this is the jeep we came in. Do you hear the sound? If you see the jeep, why didn't you see them going? Sir... I think the physician's words are coming true. Did you take your medicine? Tell me. No, did you? Nothing will be under your control if you don't take medicine on time. He told you, things would get out of control. Did you forget? Wait for a while, I'll go and get your medicine. Hey, don't go by the main road. Take the interior village roads. You want me to drop you at Palani, right? I know the way. Hey... Why did you stop? I'm asking you. Get off. What is it? - Get off, I say. Don't do this. Don't sing! Don't! Don't do this, I say! Don't play that. Don't play that, I say! Hey, he is playing it. I cannot bear the sound. Ask him to stop. He is annoying me. Ask him to stop it. Stop, please... No! Did he go away? That dog is at a distance of just 30 kilometers from here. Let us go to his house, break his fingers. Then he will never be able to play guitar in his lifetime. I have no time for that. Start the bike, let's go. I am not your driver. Don't treat me like one. We are short of time. Come, let us go. - No, I can't. Listen to me. - He is at a distance of 30 kms. Let's go straight there and break his fingers. And then, I'll drop you at Palani. Come, let us go. It's reflecting somewhere near Dindivanam. Sir, how did you find out? I got the information from our cyber cell. You mean, from Dandapani? He is a useless fellow, sir. He always gives you wrong information. That is why, I verified with Shankar Lingam as well. Shankar Lingam is even worse, sir. He would've said something to confuse us. And you believed him. This is your problem. Be it your wife or the department, you suspect everyone. Suspicion is what helps us earn our living, sir. Does that mean, you'll suspect your own wife? No, sir. But in order to maintain law and order, like how King Manuneethi Cholan gave a name to the breasts... He tied a bell to a cow. Is it? It must be right if you say so. No matter the entire department helps you or not, you left as an one-man army. I feel so proud to be working with you, sir. Hey! How long will it take? You brought me along saying that you'lll go to Mars. I believed you and came along. This is ordinary, won't you believe this? You must believe in humans. Only then will life be good. I'll wait for you, but please don't talk philosophy. Harish... Harish! Where are you? Hari... Hari... Where are you? Harish! If you don't make him defecate and remove the 3 million stuff in his stomach out, I won't let you go alive. It's not my mistake. I gave him clear instructions to swallow it in a specially made cover in Singapore and then defecate it in India. He made a mistake by keeping it in a balloon and swallowing. Don't scream at me instead of asking him. Remember, I am a Government doctor. What did I tell you? Swallow it in Singapore. Come to India and defecate. Wasn't that simple? Couldn't you do such a simple thing? Believe me, sir. I misplaced the cover he gave me, in a hurry to reach the airport. I saw a balloon vendor on my way. I bought a balloon from him, stuffed all your goods in it and just swallowed it, sir. It's all inside my stomach. I'll give it to you once I defecate. Please believe me, sir. - When? Hey, stop! - Where is Harish? Fatso, where are you barging in? - I'll break your head. Hey! - Beat him up! Who are you? Hey, who are you? - How dare you... He has got nothing to do with that. Sir, be seated. He is my guitarist friend Harish's friend. Sir, they are not related in any other way. Please, sir. Be seated. He is a friend's friend, is it? - Yes, sir. What are you doing here? Why did you come? Hey, I'm asking you. Tell me. He left saying that he had a show. He is not at home right now, you please leave. He said what he had to. Now, run away before I break your limbs and bones. I will deal with you guys once I am back from Palani. It's cocaine worth 3 million rupees. You've kept it inside your stomach for four hours and harassing us. You rascal! Tear his stomach apart and take it out. Sir, I am a family man with children. I will somehow take it out of my stomach and hand it. Spare me. Can you give him an enema and take it out? Of course, I can. But the balloon inside his stomach will burst. Cocaine worth 3 million rupees will go down the drain. Is that okay? Cocaine worth 3 millions! You're saying it so casually. - Sir... Aren't you gone yet? Can I get cocaine for Rs 2000? For Rs 2000? You... I have the money. Do I look like someone who sells drugs for peanuts? Get out, you dog! Just crush this dog and everything will be fine. How long did you make me wait? Did you break your friend's hands? Well, why is your cheek swollen? Hey, no. Please don't be afraid... Look... I am watching you through this hole. Don't be afraid. Come on. Come... Please... Sir... You seem to be a good man. Please take this off.. Yes, please. Come on, hold it. Come on, pull it off. Take only this off, not my head. Just miss! This exactly! In the same force, if something hit me like that, I will die. - Who are you? I'm an IT employee, Karthik Krishnamurthy who wants to die. It's okay if you don't shake hands with me. I will lie down here. Ride over my neck and kill me. Okay? Why did you put that on your head? That's a microwave oven. I saw on Youtube, an American put his head inside it and turned the switch on. The radiation roasted his head. I followed all the procedure rightly to die in a similar manner. But I think it's a China make. It isn't working. Thank God, it worked as a helmet and saved my life. You saved me by taking it off my head. Do me another favor by killing me, please. I beg you. Hey... - Stop it. You wanted to die, right? So, put your head inside it and die. Why would I beg you if I wanted to die using that? Please... Will you leave? Please... Brother, the one in red shirt has got up. Where are you going? I tried waking you, but you didn't. I'm running late, so I am leaving. You want to get up? Let me go. What if I didn't wake up? Will you leave me here and go? Hello... - If you lied injured here, I would've taken you to a hospital. You are standing right in front of me, talking. Kill me and go. It's late... I was unconscious all this while. What if blood oozed out of my head? Would you have left me here? It wasn't that serious. I knew, you'd come around in some time. Are you a human? Brother! Were you riding the bike? Will you drive as fast as that and run over me? Please, brother! Hey... Did you jump in front of our bike? - Yes, I'll do that again. Please, kill me. So, that's you? - Please! - Die! This exactly! If it hits in the same force, I will die. Come on, start the bike. Don't you see the bike is damaged? How will he run over you? Mechanic! I will call a mechanic and get your bike repaired. And then you may kill me. Okay? Will your dad pay the mechanic? My dad need not pay, I will. Take as much money as you want. First, run the bike over me and just kill me. - Hey! Assume, the bike is fixed. It weighs about 200 kgs. Both of us together might weigh 200 kgs which makes it 400 kgs. How can this weight kill you? Dimwit! What is he saying? He is right, he is a scientist. His job is to confuse others. Will you pay me? - Yes, I will. Okay, I will give you money. Give me the money. Go and lie there. - I will. Like you said, in full speed... - Full speed! I will run the bike in full speed over you. Yes, do it. - You will die for sure. I will die. Superb! I'll count the money... Give it here. Hold on. What? I will have to first call the mechanic, he'll come here, fix the bike and ony then will you kill me. You are asking me money in advance! Are you trying to fool me? Do you think I am a fool? You're such a fraud and I have to take your help to even die. You're a fraud. - Don't call me a fraud. What else will I call a fraud? Am I still not dead? Sir... Did you get hurt, sir? Should we go to a hospital, sir? Since how many years have you been driving? Sir, it's been eight years. Eight years? Do you have a license? I do have it. What about FC? There's enough time for that, but why are you asking me all that? Can anyone jump in front of a car so accurately? What? Did you jump purposely? You jumped in front of my car to create a scene here, is it? I jumped right in front of the wheel, you could still not kill me. Who gave you a driving license? - Sir! It is you who jumped in front of the car. I cannot kill... - Hey! Sir... I cannot! Please... Let me go. No... What happened? What's wrong with you? This is the last stock. You want... I will give half of this to you. Is this all you have? Is fifty-fifty okay? - Please... Is fifty-fifty okay? Is fifty-fifty okay? I will give it to you if you say you'll share it with me. Say it's okay and I'll give you. - Okay. Hello. - I'm Akash's dad speaking, hand the phone to him. You old man! You've called in the wrong time. Hang up. Hey! Has it been two hours? What? Where's that man with a microwave on his head? What? What's wrong with us? 'I thought only you were a joker.' 'But your dad is a bigger joker.' He said that my calculation was wrong. He even made fun of my dad. I warned him repeatedly, but he did not stop. So, I beat him to death. Him? - Anand. Anand? Who is Anand? Your class friend? Isn't he Anand? No, he isn't Anand. Isn't he Anand? Hey! Didn't we come in the car? We came by bike. We came in the car. We came on a bike. Look, it's over there. So, whose car is that? I remember. You and I were speeding on the bike and suddenly, a man came in this car and bumped into us. Correct. He came in the car and ran over our bike. Yes, that's right. He came in the car and bumped into our bike. Nonsense! It's utter rubbish! How can someone come in a car and... Gosh! We have this dead body. And a car that has no wheel. That bike... - We have a car, a bike and a deadbody. But none of the three are of any use. First, clear that. Shall we bury him? But we don't have a spade to dig. It's better to burn him. Correct, let us burn him. Oh... Hey! Aren't you a deadbody? Lie down at one place. Velu... Look over there. Do you see those two fellows? Sir, two men are standing idle under this hot sun. You are asking me if I can see them. You couldn't see them when they fled on a bike that day. They weren't there. Now, they are really here. Sir, it's really difficult to handle you. Sir, of course, I can see the ones who are present. And those who aren't, I cannot see them. How can I say otherwise? You want me to say what you want to hear. Are they here or not? What do you want me to say, they are here or not? Hey... - Anand... He isn't listening to me. Kill him. - Catch him. Sir, he is bulky. So what? Catch him. Catch him, I say! Oh... No, not there! - I know you. What are you doing there? I am not doing anything, sir. He is the one in action, sir. Hey... - Catch him. Will you catch him? Handcuff him. Come on, do it. Handcuff him. No! Handcuff him. Come here, handcuff him. Hey, why are you handcuffing me? Velu! Sir... Come, let us go. Sir... Sir... Sir... Sir... Sir... Sir... Sir... You eye on others' wives. You got me married to a girl who is five years older than me. But you make merry with her. For example, Sachin Tendulkar's wife is five years older than him. Aren't they happy? You asked me a question very often. Why do I drink? I drink because of you. You thought I was unaware of all this. I know it very well. You used me as a pawn so that you could have fun with my wife. This is what will happen if you eye other man's wife. And... Velu... What were you doing? Sir, I was checking if they went this side or escaped to that side. Don't lie to me, Velu. Weren't you dancing? No, sir. I was really checking which side the two of them could've gone. What are you holding in your hand? - The key. Come and unlock me. They beat me up till I bled. How are you fit and fine? Sir, it's been 15 years since Simran got married. You're asking me now. What are you blabbering? The two of them escaped. I asked why you didn't catch them. And you're talking senseless things. Sir, it's been a week since there is no water supply at my house. Velu, why are you talking so irrelevant? Simran got married, there is no water supply! What do you imply? Sir, why are you talking like this? You were hit on your head. I think that is why you are confused. Sir, don't bother about their escape. We can catch them tomorrow. Your health is more important to me. Come, sir. Come on, sir. Hey! Who are you? What's your name? How are you connected to them? Who are you? What's your name? How are you connected to them? I am a policeman. I am a policeman. Sir, why are you repeating his words? He is repeating my words. You stay quiet. Whose car is that? Whose car is that? Why are you laughing? Sir, I am not laughing. I'm crying on your pitiable state. It's your dad. Want to speak? How will they handcuff a thief who has only one hand? Didn't human come out of an ape? So then the monkeys now... Have they decided from when will they start becoming humans? Why did they stop becoming humans? Answer me. He is calling again. Want to speak? It's your father again. He is repeatedly calling. Either take his call or I will break this phone. Let me warn you. I'm going to relieve myself. I'll be back. Hello. Do you want to know where I am, whenever I go out? Why do you keep calling and irritating me? Don't you understand if I say it once? Disconnect the line. Your dad slipped and fell in the morning. When I went to help him get up, he didn't. Hey! If I was in your place, I would've left by now to see that man for one last time. Let's go, dude. I am talking to you. What do you want me to do? Do I leave all this and mourn for my loss? Whether I go or not, the funeral will happen. Agreed! My father has died. What can be done? Even if I go, few people will mourn with me. What next? Mourning for the dead is just to appease the society. It won't bring him back to life. It is a 20 year old dream. Going to Mars was his only ambition. Fulfilling his dream is the befitting funeral I can give him. I maybe his adopted son, but he is still my father! Adopted son? I feel like taking a drag. Do you have anything left? 'Hotel Chola, sir!' 'Our PC informed that your bike is parked outside Hotel Chola.' Dude, do you know where Hotel Chola is? 'Sir, look around and give me some landmark!' Sir, we are on a road. 'Sir, road is quite generic. Tell me what you see on road.' There is a huge Tamarind tree here, sir. Dude, this road is full of Tamarind trees. 'Sir, don't test my patience. Give me some landmark.' I can see a temple nearby. Lord Murugan's temple I presume. - 'Yup!' 'You're closeby. Pull over the jeep.' - Hey! Hey, stop the cart. - 'Sir, have you reached?' Yes! 'Don't take the jeep in. The party might notice. Park it outside.' Hey, this is the spot. Stop here. Oops! - Sir, please pay the fare! Dude, I am a Police. Stop kidding me. Just admit that you don't have money. I'll let go. Like I'll believe you are a cop. No one respects me without the uniform. Why? Do I not look like a Police? No, sir. - What? I mean I don't know why he said so, sir. The local Police was right, sir. Our bike is here. Fine! If the bike is here they must also be here. Let's go check! In which room are the two men in this photo staying? Sir, they are the owners of this place and died 13 years ago. I'm asking about these two. Sir, I just came to work and I don't have these details. Check the register. Sir, I can't show the register to random people. Call your owner! But their owner died 13 years ago. Hold on, dude. Call the incumbent owner. I don't see the owner. Only he is here. Just shut up! Call your owner now. Sir, who are you? Chennai Police. Cop? Can I see your ID card? The two men in this photo thrashed him and took it away. No jeep! No ID! No baton! No uniform! Just a big tummy! I sent 20 messages from your phone, dude. I sent a text mentioning that I am Andava Perumal and that I feel bad for not being part of the show. I asked them to send me the location. I said it's fine even if I don't get to sing and would like to watch them perform. This is all I sent. I sent it 20 times, dude. But I didn't get any reply. Not even a single response. He's sent me the location now, just for the heck of it. He dares to send location to Andava Perumal. Come in, sir. Gosh! What do you think you are doing, dude? Buddy! Hey, step down! - Sir, look at what he is doing! Hey, who are you? Hey, do you know who he is? Police, dude! So? Don't you have any sense? Can't you see the 'Do not disturb' sign on the door? I am not killing either of you or some random man. I am ending my life. This is basic human rights, dude. I don't like living here. Do you follow? How does it bother you? How dare you disrespect us! Rascal! I'll kill you! If you want to end your life, why didn't you do it two hours ago? Why do it when I am in charge? Look, sir. He wants to die with the ID! - File a case on him, sir. He's barged into my room and invades my privacy! File a case. Why me? Sir, file a case on him now. - Sir! What is he saying? Sir, what is he saying? - Get lost! Have you seen the two men in this photo? - Go away, sir. Don't show me all this. Fraud! Fraud! Fraud! They are big time frauds, sir. Why should I look at a fraud's face before dying, sir? Sir, committing suicide isn't easy! Please go, sir. I've lost the will to die. I am upset. I'll find another place to die. - Sorry, sir. Actually I've a doubt, sir. The suicide guy said he plans to take his life, but - Sir! Sir! Didn't tell the reason. - Sir! Sir! He is rushing out, sir. What if he attempts suicide in another room? Please come, sir. I don't care. Go away. Get out of my sight. Dude, where are you going? Come here! Why did you come? You're such a pain, sir. Why did you go? You asked us to get out of your sight, sir. Will you just blindly follow? Use your brains! Look! This suicide plot is just a diversion. He has some connection with these two men. So, I'm quite sure that they are staying in this hotel. Let's check every room in this hotel. We can definitely nab them. I'm feeling bored. Give me the keys. I'll leave. I need the keys! You don't own the liquor or the bike! Do you follow? 20 years! You've been aspiring to go to Mars for over 20 years. Can you deny? I also have dreams. My band! I want to perform before everyone! I am unable to. You'll never understand. Not a chance. Four blocks, seven floors. 228 rooms in total. We should check every room. Hey! - I guess we'll take a week to cover this corridor. Go! - No! - When do we begin with rooms? What did I do? - I won't let you. - Gosh! Don't run! - Their fight is never ending. How do we handle the suicide case, sir? Let's just focus on our assignment. Okay! Carry on. Hey! - Fool! Sir! Bar! Are you here to drink or nab the convicts? Of course to nab the convicts. Why do want to drink then? - No, sir. Keep it low! - Such a pain. Let's discuss our plan over drinks. I know you plan on getting drunk. But I am not falling for it. Sir! - Excuse me. - Yes please! Hey! Don't you want to nab them? Do you think the convicts will have drinks at a public bar? Correct, sir. He wouldn't be puking if he had got the mix of soda and alcohol right. Am I correct? We got to check. Wait! Let me call him. Dude! - Hey! I mean let's go check every room. This won't suffice! Hey, fetch me another round! Hey buddies! You won't kill even if I beg you to. Why are the cops looking for you? - Cops? Yes! The Police are looking for you! Give me some water. Just a glass of water. Why do you glare at me? What did the Police ask you? "Why do you refuse to give water?" - Water! "Are you from the neighboring state?" "Though they give in, they don't let go of it!" 'Water! Water!' - I am asking you! Why are you singing? Stop singing and answer me. - 'Oh water!' What did the Police want? - Answer us! - 'Oh water!' How can you say I didn't get my target? I've done 45 in place of 25. What more do you need? I think he mistook us for someone. Don't call yourself a Team Leader. You are not Malhotra Let go! Have I ever shirked off from work? 10 years! I've slogged hard carrying out your orders. 'What did the cops ask?' Supervisor's pet becomes manager. Manager's favorite becomes Team Lead. Team Lead's choice goes on-site. Sincere workers like me lose out. What did the cops want? - Hey! Malhotra, don't say another word. I'll hit you with this bottle. It's my time now. If only an IT employee gets a chance to speak to the Team Lead directly, I'm sure they will rip him apart. IT company! My foot! My death will serve as a trigger for every IT employee! We don't have much time, sir. Let's ask them to install CCTV in every room! What do you think, sir? English? - Yeah! CCTV is not a bulb to be fixed as and when you please! - Sorry, sir. Sir! Something is not right! - Correct, sir. Those shades do not look good on them. Hey Velu! How many heads do you see? Are you asking about the first time or now, sir? Second time? One! What about first time? - Two! Hey, you are already late. Get the parcel! Hold on! Velu! You say that you can hear even what people don't say out loud. Can you repeat whatever he just said? I didn't hear him clearly, sir. Can you ask him to repeat? You are Ramalingam's man. Am I right? Answer me! - Hold on! You don't have to repeat all of it. Just say the last three words. Did Ramalingam send you here? Ramalingam, dude. Professor Ramalingam. Hey! Hey! He's not a professor or priest. Just get the Rs 3 Million worth drug out of his stomach, dude. Just get the Rs 3 Million worth drug out of his stomach, dude. Hey Velu, Professor Ramalingam! Akash's father. Where is Akash? Tell me. Ramalingam assured me that though you don't look like a physician, you are a genius at work. Are you not that guy? Answer me! Are you not the one? Are you kidding me? Dude, do something! Get the stock out. Dude, do something! Get the stock out. What do you want me to do? Please get it out of me, sir. - Do something. Get it out of me, sir. Get him to take a dump and deliver stock! Stop it! Do I look like someone who induces poop? 105! 106! - Sir! Didn't you ask for 107? Yes! 107! - Come in! Sir! Sir! Gosh! They've brutally attacked a cop! Sir! Do I have to get this man to take a dump? Poor thing! They've attacked his head! How can you get someone to poop by hitting on the head? Who are you, dude? I am physician Vaithyalingam. Hopeless! They mistook me for you and beat me. - But you can't pass through the head. Take a look at my wound! Don't I have to give you tablets for excretion? One tight slap! You'll soil your pants! Treat my wound! I don't care what you do! But I need a bike now. Huh? - It's getting late. I need a bike. Do we beat him again take his bike? I'll find another bike. Hey! Come here! Sir, what are you doing here? My God! They've literally butchered your head, sir. Where were you? Sir, I went to call the local Police as soon as you were in danger. Where are they? Only after I reached the station, it struck me that it would be a disgrace, if they see you defeated! So, I gave up on my idea returned to spot. Chuck it, sir. Doesn't matter. How do we deal with this case further? The astrologer had warned me against taking up new cases for next three months. So? We've got the bike. Let's get back home! Oh sure! But if we go back now your VRS pension honor all of it will go down the drain! Sir! You must have a graceful retirement, sir. You deserve this honor! What do you want me to do now? Your honor, pride and respect are being dragged by Akash and Andava Perumal to the highways! Let's follow them and revive it all. Give it a thought, sir. Your future is dependent on them. Keep going, dude. Head straight for 25KMS. Google map says so! There's still 25KMS left to reach Concert's destination. The Google map specifies the distance to our destination. You carry on! Play to your heart's content. I am coming there. I'll break your hands first! Carry on! You keep going, dude. Once we reach, I'll sing! We'll defeat the others and rock the show! Do you follow? - We go, we sing, we conquer, we rock! We go, we sing, we conquer, we rock! We go, we sing, we conquer, we rock! We go, we sing, we conquer, we rock! We go, we sing, we conquer, we rock! We go, we sing, we conquer, we rock! We go, we sing, we conquer, we rock! My master has advised me Huh? That the size of the audience doesn't matter keep up the good work! Well said! Where we sing, the kind of audience or the number of listeners does not matter at all! What matters is what we sing and how we perform! I never sing to make others happy. Not once! I always sing for my happiness! Just to make me happy! You've come to the right spot. Don't laugh, buddy! I am telling you! Stop laughing! Hey! Don't mock me. Hey! Don't you hear me? Stop laughing. Hey! Stop laughing! "What penance you did?" "What penance you did" "to beget the universal lord" "as your dear son, Mother Yashoda?" "What penance you did" "to beget the omnipresent" "Lord as your son, Mother Yashoda?" "What penance you did?" "What penance you did?" "What penance you did?" "Mother Yashoda!" Hey Velu, ask him! Okay! Hey, do you serve tea? My boss wants to know. I didn't ask for tea, dude. Do I order a coffee then? Show him the photo and ask if he has seen them here! Sure! Sir, have you seen these two men before? Did they pass by here? Virat Kohli! Football player! You seem smarter than my boss! Give me the tea! That's enough! Give it. What did he say? Sir, he calls him Virat Kohli. Do you want some tea? Get lost! Have you seen these two men before? Answer me! Sir! I am conducting the inquiry! Why do you rush then? Sir, he is a lunatic. Don't show all this to him. Thank God! I didn't ask him! Can't you do face reading? You are quite sassy with all this but mess up at work! Chuck it, sir. You must be hungry! Let's have a bun. We have a long day ahead. Have you heard of Daedalus and Icarus story? How will you manage to eat on Mars? Do you get food there? Tell me! - Father Daedalus and his son Icarus were imprisoned. But Daedalus was a genius! He made wings out of wax to escape from the prison. Is there any connection between this story and our trek? Father and son flew out of the prison soon! While flying, the father warned the son against going close to the sun! But the son didn't not listen to his father. So, his wings melted and he fell to the ground! Are you saying the father and son could fly without getting high? My father flew away too! Is he dead? - Nah! He ran away with someone and never returned. 'Did you see that? They've brought the stock after strong warning!' How dare you mess with our boss? He'll cut you out like 'Atho' noodles. Get going! I asked you to go on! Get going! What is this, brother? You used words like Atho', tight! You speak both in English and Tamil. I am unable to follow! You need more exposure for this, dear. He says we've got the stock after warning! Who are those guys? How will I know? Hey, don't tell me that so many people are eager to go to Mars. I didn't say anything wrong. I setup business for you at my cost and send my men to assist you whereas you are trying to make a fool of me! Believe me, sir. I didn't do it. No matter how many times you hit me, my answer remains the same. The stock is inside his stomach! Hey, I am not falling for your tricks. You took money from me. Yes, sir! - How much? Rs 3 Million, sir. - Did you count? Yes, sir. - Was it right? Where is the stock? - Sir! Sir, it is inside his stomach. He is not passing it out. We can slit open and recover it. Please slit it open and take it, sir. You are saying I can slit his stomach and take it. - He is lying, sir. He has hidden it somewhere. My stomach is empty. Please believe me, sir. Hey, don't you dare mess with me. I'll smash you both to death! Excuse me! Can you shift this to the other side? I have an important work here. Hey, who are you? Wait up! Hey! God is great! I can feel God! - Hey! Who are you? He is omnipresent! Confirmed! Hey, how are you connected to him? I don't know who he is, sir. 'I blurted out of fear, sir.' Dude, did you get scared looking at them? If I were in your place, no one would oppose me. I'd have killed every one of them. Just like how you did at your guitarist friend's house, is it? Dude! Are you trying to invoke some spirit to take you to Mars? You don't talk about it. I know what's on your mind. Please continue. Ouch! Dear God! I'm exhausted. Ouch! Dude, I've an urgent work here. Can you clear this spot? Hey, you want to die. Is that all? Yes! I want to die. I want to jump off this cliff and die. Can you clear out or not? You're very unlikely to die if you jump off here. But if you try it from another spot there... Hey! I'll decide where to end my life, not you! The wind speed is low here. You'll get stuck in a tree. Further, it is a slope! But it is just rocks on the other side. Your head will burst the moment you land. Death is certain! No chances of survival! You are a true friend! You fatso! We can definitely take it. - I'll do it right away! I'll slit his stomach! Go on, sir! - Don't, sir. The stock will get mixed with blood and will turn useless. No gains! Please, sir. - Stop it! Earlier, you denied it! Now, you say it'll get mixed. Are you kidding me? - Excuse me! Hello, brothers! This spot suits my requirement. Can you move aside? - Who are you? Sorry! I am Karthik Krishnamurthy, IT employee. Hey, are you planning something by bringing in new people? Not at all, sir. I don't know him. I am going to kill all of you! - Hey! How dare you? You came here to end your life. You could have just let him kill you. - Hey! I don't trust his skills. If he had slit my throat, I'd have had a painful death. I got a gun to avoid all this. Sigh! Hey, you'll die if you jump from here. Hey, you don't understand. The speed of wind is just 20 mph! If I jump perpendicularly at 90 degree, my body will flip around. I'll just have few fractures and not die. Instead, if I shot myself, my body would have hit the ground at full gravitational force and I'd have died. He does not know the value of time. Just keeps talking. He came to end his life. Let him die! Dog! You'll burn to death! I am not responsible for you. So, get back! I am sure you aimed the stone at me with an intent to kill! Tell me the truth! - I don't know. Maybe! You are lying! Do you know why you spared my life? You are very fond of me and I know it! The most torturous fourteen days of my life is the time I spent with you! You have no purpose or ambition in life. No man will want to befriend you! I'll definitely kill you now. Go away! Hey, go away. No! I don't want you to go. You might have suffered these 14 days. - Go! But I had a good time. - Go away! I was very happy! - Get lost! I have no one. - Get lost! I won't let you go! I will not let you go! Go away! - No! I won't let you go to Mars! No! I can't let you go. - Let go! I will not let you go. - Leave me alone. There is no one to take care of you! I won't let you go! - Leave me. No! No! I won't let you go! Let me go, buddy! You're wearing a space suit. How did I get here? Did you also land on Mars? Mars! My foot! Here! Take this! Take this kick! I had plans to end my life. Both of you ruined it for me. I can excuse everything but your logic of wind speed and theory of slope. Slope! Don't call yourself a scientist. Scientist! Scientist! You fool! Mars! Scientist! Both of you have ruined... Just go! Such a hopeless life! I want to die. I don't know what to do. I should have hanged myself. Total flop! You aimed to fly into the outer space! But we have rolled about 200 feet downwards! Just 200 feet! 200 feet downwards! Hey! Will it occur again? No! I didn't mean to ask about our trip downward. I am asking about alignment of Earth with Mars. You said something! After how many years will this occur again? 30 years! 30 more years? 30 years! I don't care if it is 30 years or 300 years or 3000 years. I'll definitely go to Mars! 30 years! Fine! How can you be sure about 3000 years later? Are you out of your mind? Hey! I can do it. Rifath Sharukh, a Tamil boy. A school boy. He's completed only twelfth grade. NASA has launched his satellite. There are lot of scientists in our country. Yet how could this young boy achieve something that they couldn't? How did he do it? His victory is the result of efforts he put in all his previous lives! Did you smoke up? Hey! Don't leave me. Wait! I'll come along. Hey! You aspired to go to Mars. But you didn't make it. What are you plans now? Answer me! Velu! - Sir! - We got them. Don't act in haste, sir. They made you go around. Let them come. We'll corner them here. We could have caught them alive, sir. Why did you shoot them? Did I shoot? 'In the next birth' 'One fine day in Mars' '[CODED MESSAGE]' '[CODED MESSAGE]'
