This movie is the true life story of MUSLUM GURSES. Muslum, the power is out but it's filled to the brim inside. I'm bumming a smoke. How dark has it played out to be My destiny They don’t bleat The sheep and its lamb Heaving a sigh in a foreign land I cry I cry The electricity came back when Muslum came on stage. The end band of this heart of mine Is broken Good evening Muslum. My evil fate was written Cloudy weather and scattered showers are expected. Prime minister Ecevit talked about... This year our relations... ...many issues have been accelerated of economic cooperation. We’ve been paying close attention to this matter since we started governing. Boss, shall we stop by at the soup house? Boss? Father! Father! Mother's calling you. Open your palm. Go on! I said go! Go on. Go on Muslum! Your brother is gone, look. Where should we go? Father told me we were going to Adana. 7 YEARS LATER Muslum! Stop! Muslum! - What's up, Muslum? - Good. Muslum! How's it going, Mehmet? Fuck off. - Get over here, you rascal! - What are you doing? Bugger off. Muslum! Where are you, you piece of shit! Muslum! Muslum! Adana Community Centre. Shoemaker Lokman, have you seen the rascal Muslum? No, I haven't seen him Mehmet. He didn't show up for work today, either. We raise our thumbs. Who are you hiding from, son? What is your name? Muslum! Where are you? From my father. Who knows what you have done. Because I always sing songs with the other kids. Songs? Your crime is serious, my son. Look, they call me Lemon Ali. Why don't you stop by sometimes so we can be partners in crime? I have to go. Ahmet... ...is dad home? My uncle is. Did you get ice cream? I did. What flavour? Hazelnut? I couldn't find hazelnut. It's chocolate. Emine... ...I told the guy from the hotel that It would be ready in two days. We got the money as well, I wouldn’t want to be ashamed. - Take care. - Don't worry. - Uncle, has mom told dad? - She has. You will continue working as an apprentice. Wasn't I supposed to be finishing school this year? The poor woman's hands are done for, so that she could make a few dimes. Don't you see how she is? What's wrong with his mother? I said what's wrong with his mother? You two get inside. Go! You'll see now, get inside. You didn't go to work today and what happened? No pay for today! Where is the damn money? - Let him go! - Sit down! What are you complaining about? I break my back every day hauling things around! You will find money. Where is the money? Leave the boy alone! - You will earn money! - Mehmet stop! Here. Take the money. This is it? We need some for the house. I am the house. I am the house! The house needs money? Fine. Dad! Please, no! Sit down! Don't get involved! - Dad please! - Don't get involved! Don't get involved! - I am the house! - Mom! Adana Community Centre. So, quarter rest... Muslum, come in son. Take a seat. Sit. Tell me now... ...are you here because you escaped or because you chased? I don’t understand. Are you here because you escaped or because you chased? I really don’t understand. We'll take care of it. I'm on a long narrow road I walk all day, I walk all night. I don’t know what state I am in I walk all day, I walk all night. Day and night Didn’t I nail it, master? You will. You will... But tell me first... ...what this long narrow road is? Son, it is life. A narrow long road with birth on one end... ...and death on the other. The great Veysel said so. Like we are here right now. Actually, we are not standing still at all. We are travelling down a road and... ...each of us has a different path... ...which is why everyone sings this song... ...differently. Every song or ballad holds a unique story within... ...and you cannot just go and sing them with no soul. You see? You should listen to the you inside yourself. You will be deaf to everything, you will not hear if the world falls down. Got it? Face that mirror over there. Let's see. Lesson number two. There is a long narrow road ahead of you. Try to imagine that road. Close your eyes. Now walk on that road and tell me about it. I'm on a long narrow road. I walk all day, I walk all night. I don’t know what state I am in. I walk all day, I walk all night. Day and night Day and night Day and night I don’t know what state I am in. I walk all day, I walk all night. Day and night Day and night Day and night Play, play. Pay attention to the note. The moment I came into this world. Pay attention to the note. I started walking at the same time. In a two-door inn I walk all day, I walk all night. Day and night Day and night Day and night In a two-door inn I walk all day, I walk all night. Day and night Day and night What's wrong, boy? Why did you stop? We can quit if you're tired. No. I am not tired. What is it then? My father. What's wrong? My mom was called to the police station yesterday. My father stole. They said he would spend two years behind bars. Okay. In that case... ...you will be the man of the house. Raise your head and look at me. Muslum... ...you do not have your father at your side but you have music in your heart. And that will be enough for you. Right? Here you go. This is yours. First you will learn to play baglama... ...and then you will take care of your mother and brother. After that, you will go on stage with me. - On stage? - Yes. - Really, master? - Yes, together. All right, if your mother called you need to get going. Okay, master. Don't forget what I said. I won't master. Thank you. Mommy! My brother is here! - Welcome. - Hi, mom. - Are you hungry? - No mom, I'm not. Let’s chase one another? Okay. The sheets are going to get dirty. It'll be fine, mom. Get over here, got you! I got you! Come here! I got you! Mommy. - What do you want? - Can we play "swing"? - No. - Come on, please. - No. - Please. Oh, please. Please. All right then "Swing". She gave permission! Swing! Swing! Dear guests! You are most welcome! Shortly, we will be watching... ...the great actor Yilmaz Guney's latest movie. But before that... Muslum! ...here comes... Where have you been you? - ...the one and only baglama master... - Go on! ...whom you all know and listen fondly... ...Lemon Ali! And a young talent who Ali has taught. Muslum Akbas!

We will perform many more times, mom. Someday you won't have to do laundry anymore. And I will go back to school. - And so will Ahmet. - I pray to God, my son. I will pay for my brother's education as well. I pray so. We will even buy a house from the city. Motorbike! We will buy a car, too. You don't believe me? Come on, mother. - We are ready? - Ready! Let's go. Both me and the client are tired of the same faces and voices! I'm a businesswoman... Ayse is mine, okay? Fine, fine. Where have they been? I will send you to big weddings and balls. Hey Muslum, have you ever kissed a girl? Not on the mouth but on the cheek and neck. You don't say! Shush! Muslum! There they are! Come on, Muslum! You will leave those women. - Come on! - Hold on a second! - You're not coming? - You go. Fine. You go and kiss Muhterem Nur, if you can. Let's go girls. He's going to kiss Muhterem Nur. - Muhterem Nur? - Only in his dreams. Would Muhterem Nur even appear in his dream? Muhterem Nur won’t kiss him. Never in a million years. Your voice is good. And you are handsome as well. If you listen to what I say, you will be very famous. Are you in love, son? What’s going on? Don't fool around! Get to work! Alright, master. We're waiting for all the people of Adana... ...who believe in their vocal talents to Sahmeran Cafe. The winner will get a record deal. Have you heard, master? - What? - They said "a record". What did they say? They said 'a record' master, a record! They would make a record! Hold on. Where are you going? What record? Attention, attention! Applications will be done with a headshot! What did you just say? I didn't hear you. New Golden Microphone Voice Competition, next Saturday... What time? What time, please tell me! ...at 2:00pm! Where is it, where is it, where is the competition? I didn't hear! - Go away! - Sir!.. We're expecting you to Sahmeran Cafe. All the people of Adana who believe in their vocal talents... Mom, guess what happened today. The man of the house has come. Aren’t you going to welcome your dad, bum? - Welcome dad. - Kiss! Ahmet, come. You've become a grown man, huh? Emine, he has grown so much in 2 years, right? I couldn't even see their faces. Damn it! Eat... eat boy! So... did you take good care of your mother? Since you play on stage now... You're going to be famous. She's relying on you, isn't she? She says she is going to divorce me. Whoever she trusts... Let's go for to listen him one night. And you won't have to go out alone at night anymore. There would be rumours, what would people say? Emine. You are not a whore, right? I'm going out for a walk. Move aside. Bum! Welcome dad. Where's your master? He's gone to pray. Dad, what are you doing? - Dad! - Don't move. Dad, please don't! So, you are joining the contest, huh? - Stop! - Dad! Please! Now join the contest. Well, come in. "My beard and my brow, my moustache and my head... ...may God give me grace of success in the work I do, I shear this beard." Who says this? Kaygusuz Abdal. Shear he says... ...by which he means pluck. This is called "djar-u darp" Dervish cuts away every piece what he has on his head and face. If all the people of the world unite... ...and say this is valuable and precious... ...the dervish will tell them all to fuck off. This is why dervish is a dervish. Muslum, your voice is greater than your hair and body. No hair cut will diminish its value. Your voice will only be silenced if you become silent. Got it? MAY 1967 Adana bridgehead Sit down facing the palace Come let’s stroll around Against friend and enemy Hit the anchor, the anchor Hit the pickaxe, the pickaxe The lover ties up around her head The pinked silk scarf And we have listened to all the contestants. We thank all of them. Now it is time to announce the winner. The winner of the golden microphone singing contest is... Come. Come inside. Mehmet? Honey. Come on, my beauty. Honey... ...whose big brother has won the contest? I love your cute little face. You sang very beautifully. I love you so much. Mom, what are we going to tell dad? We'll say that we are going away. Leave us be we'll say. We will move in with your uncle. Tomorrow will take care of itself. Or maybe we won't say anything and just leave. It is screwed up. And after all my efforts... I plug it on one side and another part of the roof leaks. I can’t repair it. I was worried that children would be affected. I didn't want them to get wet. So, you have made up your mind. Emine... ...you're going to take children and get lost... ...without saying anything? Without so much as a word... ...you’ll be gone? Good. I won't stop you. Get the fuck out of here. Sit down! Sit! Nobody leaves this table! Nobody leaves this table! Sit. Leave the child alone. Fuck off! Leave her! - Put her down! - Stay back! Fuck you and your child. Who the hell are you? Who the hell are you?!

I couldn't go to school but you will. Promise me. Okay. We practised this song in, right? We will practise it again this time. Understood? You start, I will be right back. How's it going? Tell me. - You remember the guy from the radio? - Yes? How can I say this to you? He asked me if I played at clubs. - So? - And I said no. Then? He said "The money is good, and that everyone plays there." We made the record, nothing came out of it. Do you give me permission? Son... ...you had come here willingly and now you are leaving with the same eagerness. You want to go... ...then it shall be in peace. Give me your blessings, master. Give me your blessings. They are all yours. - Don't get lost along the way. - I won't, master. Don't worry. So... Caravans filled with passion Travel through your door They drink the wine of love And worry about you This is the bed of the poor Nightingales are the companions of my troubles This is the bed of the poor Nightingales are the companions of my troubles Your love makes me sing I cry, I cry Your love makes me sing I cry, I cry Did I get the message across?

Go on, then. Bring a damn pen and I will sign it! Sit down. Ruya, stand up. You should be ashamed. What! What! What are you doing here? Oh, my dear brother, where have you been? Ahmet, my dear brother! School is closed, right? Yes. Why?... Why didn't you let me know? I could have bought your ticket from here. I just came by myself. What did you do? - I came by myself. - You came. - Here. - What's that? My God... "For my dear brother" Thank you. If just a tongue sings, ears hear it, If the heart sings, the universe listens. Put this on. Put it on. - I'll be back in the morning. - May you do well. - Are you going to sleep? - Yes. - Why don’t you go to my bed? - Nah, here is fine. Here. Better to count beads than troubles. - Do you want anything? - Could you turn the lights off? Ahmet? Look... ...it smells like mother. Smell it. Listen! "Come let us burn today, so we don’t get burned tomorrow. Let us die when we are not dying to avoid death tomorrow." I will also become a Gurses. Ahmet Gurses. What did you say? Gurses? Alright. First, grow a moustache like this. Then you can become a Gurses. I hate Akbas. Listen here. Ahmet Gurses. "I did not come for a feud. I only care about love." I won't return to Konya, brother. But school starts next week? I'll quit school. What on earth? You will have your education! - Later? - Later... ...you are going to become whatever you want. Brother... ...do you know why my father named me Ahmet? He said "Let's see if this one will die like his brother or not." What have you done? What you have done? I was expelled from school. Look at me. You are my heart. Got it? Do not break my heart. Don't tear my heart out. TRT Cukurova radio wishes you a good day. 13.000 convicts united with their families... ...after the new law wiped out all criminal charges. What do you mean he came? I don't want him to come! - Let's talk for a second. - What is there to talk? What are you going to say to me? I'll kill you! Why did you come here?! - Ahmet! - Why is he here?! - I'll beat you! - Stop! Why did you let him in? Ahmet! Ahmet! Everything is in order? Why did you let him in? He should have died and rotted. What should we do? Huh? Tell me? Should we let him end up on the streets? Should we be just like him? Are you a saint? How do you like it? Your stuff is here as well. It is not bad. Did you pay for it? Yes, I did. Good. I'd like it if Ahmet stayed with me but... ...he doesn't even talk to me. He is not like you. He is vicious. He is like his mother. But you are just like me. Your nature is just like mine. Muslum... ...stop by before you go so we can drink Raki as father and son. I've drank your Raki. Let's go. Brother, a girl passed by me. She is also from our village. She is... ...so beautiful. What kind of a fertile village is this! Huh? - We'll find one for as well? - Nah, thanks boss. Your love is troublesome I couldn't predict, before I fell in Strangers attain their desire I couldn't This is the bed of the poor Nightingales are the companions of my troubles This is the bed of the poor Nightingales are the companions of my troubles Your love makes me sing I cry, I cry Your love makes me sing I cry, I cry When I get to the army unit, I write. Let's go girls. He's going to kiss Muhterem Nur. - Muhterem Nur? - Only in his dreams. Would Muhterem Nur even appear in his dream? - What will you do weekend? - Mom's coming this weekend. This guy is moving! Is he alive? He is alive! Hurry up! Hurry! - Blood transfusion is needed right away. - Two unit blood is ready. Muslum? Muslum? Can you hear me? Can you hear me Muslum? You were in an accident, do you remember? Driver? What? Driver? I'm sorry. We lost him. Muslum... ...policemen left this here. Your belongings. Let me see. How do you feel? My head? We placed a metal plate inside your head. You must protect that area at all times. You will experience frequent headaches. Muslum, unfortunately your left ear will not function anymore. You won't be singing anymore. But you are alive now. Make the most of it. You crushed me into dust Made me a toy for your servants Tortured me as if it that wasn’t enough I’ve finally become-- Inside I have... ...my tears. This is called "djar-u darp" Dervish cuts away every piece what he has on his head and face. This is why dervish is a dervish. Your voice is greater than your hair and body. Your voice will only be silenced if you become silent. 3 YEARS LATER One by one the gates of hope were shut Inside me there is a heart wound My tears are of no use It is a fantasy world we live in My tears are of no use I have never heard a voice like that. Nobody has. He is great. Thank God for a talent like his. You crushed me into dust Made me a toy for your servants Tortured me as if it was not enough You've got me turning rebellious in the end Way to go! Tortured me as if it was not enough You've got me turning rebellious in the end Really wonderful! Wonderful! Good evening. May I? Good evening. Do you remember me? You don’t? We were featured in local news, we had a photo together. You don’t remember. I’m sorry brother, what was your name? It's Bahtiyar. Take a seat, dear Bahtiyar. It is not necessary. I sit with you every day. I come here every single night. Why? I'm a big fan. There's a guy from Istanbul who owns a record company, Burhan Bayar. And I took him here so he could listen to you. I swear he was overwhelmed. He said nothing but "Wonderful!" "Wonderful!". Maybe if you talk to him... I've made so many records. What happened? This guy came from Istanbul... ...I'm talking about, Ali Tekinture, Yavuz Taner. Just have a chat with him and if it doesn’t work out then it doesn’t. Bahtiyar... ...go... ...and talk to him yourself. - I talk to him? - Yes. But... He asks what you eat or drink... Tell him that I eat simit. Tell him that... ...I want to be paid squarely. Right away, boss. They should pay you. But if he agrees... ...you’ll go to Istanbul. Together? We'd go together? Together? All right then we'll go together. Yes. Maybe you won’t be able to stop singing this song Your heart won't feel it even if your tongue sings it It wouldn’t matter to me even if you knew I only wish for you to be happy You don’t know that I wrote this to you And would listen to it like it was a foreign song God comes first and then you I only wish for you to be happy Muslum Gurses from Adana is sweeping the nation. He is the father of all music fans now. Trust me no one could take your place And this song vouches for our love Don’t even think if I am crazy or not I only wish for you to be happy I told you about my love in this song If you do not hear it, I won't be sad I have got used to your absence over the years I only wish for you to be happy I told you about my love in this song If you do not hear it, I won't be sad I have got used to your absence over the years I only wish for you to be happy This is it, boss. Hear it out! - Buy it. - I'm buying it right now. Come on, you grumble a lot. Isn’t Nazim here? Yes he is. There he comes. - Nazim. - Here I come. - Welcome Bahtiyar. - Hi. Here is your money. Nobody asked money from you. Alright then. Thanks. Let's go. Boss, what are you doing? He is kidding. I object to this cruel fate I object to this endless sorrow To the temptation of fate To the slap of life To all heartaches I object "REBELLIOUS" FILM SET Come on, eat these as well. You should eat them. You feed me all the time. Bread is the staff of life, Osman. And isn’t your life accounted for? You don’t eat, you don’t drink... When will you take care of yourself? Osman, you said a thousand words not to eat one slice of bread. Eat this already, don’t make me stuff it down. Brother, I sometimes wonder, how can I ever repay you? "Why do you talk like that? There is no paying back between brothers." - "Why do you talk like that?" - Huh? "Why do you talk like that? There is no paying back between brothers." Why do you talk like that? There is no paying back between brothers. But you are not just a brother... ...you are my father, mother, my only pillar of support. "Don’t talk too much, you'll be late for school." Cut! I will deal with it right away. Look. You see Muslum father. What went wrong, my dear? I remembered Ahmet. What do I understand of acting anyway? What is there not to understand? It's going great. What's so great about it? I am telling you it is perfect. Who cares? I swear to you, you will be a legend. A legend! To unfinished love To fake smiles To die without living I object Armed forces had to take control of the administration in order to... ...restore the government authority. Am I always destined to lose? Am I always destined to be crushed? I object to these lies and deceits What do I owe these troubles? They won't let go of me Of course, there's going to be sleeping disorders and headaches. Imbalance, loss of hearing. Do you have nightmares? Yes... You easily get angry. And you indulge in alcohol to relieve yourself. Look Muslum, you must quit alcohol immediately. If you don’t, you might experience anger outbursts. What can I do? I will prescribe a medicine for you, Sulphir. You must not take it with alcohol. Otherwise you will experience discomfort and loss of consciousness. One last song and then we are next. Why are we here? In someone else’s tour? My dear... ...we have promised these guys. It's one night only then we go on our way. We will get paid. Can't you take it a bit slow? You are taking pills. Oh, my head... I know but people have travelled such long distances to see you. Everyone is waiting for you. Why? They love you "father". One last song. And then it's over. One last song and we-- What's going on? You are not far away Be careful my dear! - What's wrong? - What is happening? What's wrong? I don't get it. I was going to sing it. Whose voice is this? Who the hell are you? I was going to sing it. Boss, stop it. This is Muhterem Nur. I am so pissed off with drunks and the tour itself. Nobody can hit me! Nobody! He did not hit you. A woman shouldn’t be slapped. He did not know it was you. He was shocked when he realized it was you. Even he was drunk, he knew you. Muhterem who I know... ...wouldn't chicken out because of a slap. That woman is exhausted. I thought he was worthy. He sings so deep from his heart. I said to myself that he had a great soul. He was just a jerk. A plain jerk. Don’t care about him. He is not worth it. We are leaving soon. We are off to Rize after tomorrow. It's over. How could he dare to hit me? How? Okay. Go and hit him. No. Let him be. May I never see him again. Muhterem, you won't see him again. - Let go of me! - Look... - ...you and him will go to separate ways. - What are you doing? - Let go of me, Suzan. - Please stay here, please. Put my name on the tour. Which tour? The tour Miss Muhterem is on. But we are expected from Istanbul. We behaved shamefully. And you didn't stop me. - I couldn't do it. - How couldn't you?! There was a long distance between me and the stage. I could not catch up with you. Put my name on the tour. But we are expected... You will make a record, shoot a movie... - They can wait. You go and make them. - They are waiting. Go and do it. Give them an excuse for me. But wouldn't they say what could be more important than this? It's business... Bahtiyar... ...do you know Dervish? What Dervish? Sometimes a dervish can tell everyone to fuck off. Did you know? You don’t. Great Muhterem Nur. We hit her. What kind of a man are you? We sold out eight concerts in four cities. All of them are tea gardens but it's fine. You have to fix the sound system. It's a big problem. It makes an awful sound on stage. She's right. I can't hear my voice, either. - That microphone is shitty. - Yes. Here are the new posters. Unwrap it. What is he doing here? We forgot to tell you that Muslum has joined the tour. How come? His manager is my close friend. He asked for it and I couldn't say no. But we will make a lot of money. After all, it is Muslum Gurses. What more can we ask for? Certainly, we are going to make a lot money. We should welcome him. Has he arrived yet? He checked in early in the morning. He might be resting in his room now. Muhterem. Is he kidding me? What are you talking about? Calm down. I will show him! Stay out of it! Don't interfere! - Where is that guy? - Who? Muslum. He is in room 104, right across the hall from you. Her hands are in my hand Her eyes are locked into mine Her hands are in my hand Her eyes are locked into mine I have been crying for years Because of you Oh mountains Hyacinth fields I have been crying for years Because of you Oh mountains Hyacinth fields Look at me. Don't confuse me with others. If you are coming with us... ...if you behave shamefully again-- Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. Miss Muhterem. Miss Muhterem. Will you forgive me? Should I get going? I am sorry. Hello? Hello? Who is this? What? Were you sleeping? You woke me up. "Street of the poor!" What? The movie I saw you in for the first time. There was... ...a girl in the drive-in-theatre. It is not proper to say but we were going to meet that night and end up kissing. It was going to be my first kiss. Anyway... ...I couldn't do anything because I couldn't take my eyes off you. She left. I missed the first kiss. Hello. So... He is not in the room, he is at the door. ...you owe me something. What is happening? Nothing. Go back to sleep. Turns out it is a family hotel. God... So... What are we going to do young man? Huh? Tell me. Come over here and take a seat. That's the story. I don't remember anything else. I was taken to the morgue because they thought I was dead. Then they realized I was alive. And so here we are. There is a plate in my head. It's holding everything together. Even my nose doesn’t function anymore. Everything smells like cheap alcohol. There are constant headaches. This ear is gone, too. I don’t hear a thing. Hearing is my life. What do I do now? "Listen to yourself," my master used to say. "Listen to your heart." He knew what would happen to me. And I said ok, hearing myself is enough for me. And hearing you. No other voice is necessary. What good would hearing my voice do to you? I will do whatever you say. Sleep already. You know, I saw you in a concert in Adana years ago. Really? I guess you were 16 or 17. I wonder what I was singing? You were singing "All this trouble and sorrow" I asked myself what kind of a sorrow could a kid that age possibly endure? As if you were not singing it but you were the song itself. Something like that. It was something truly extraordinary. Why didn’t you come near me? If I had known I would have come running. I would... Go to sleep. I plunged into the lakes like a green duck I plunged into the lakes like a green duck You threw my name around I’ll shake the dust off my feet into foreign lands Don’t forget me nor will I I’ll shake the dust off my feet into foreign lands Don’t forget me nor will I Ezo... She was two years old. I was so happy... ...when I found out I was going to have a sister. Poor child. May she rest in peace. Amen. I'm the only one who left alive in this photo. I couldn't get enough of my mother and sister... ...and my brother Ahmet. But you had the chance of knowing your mother. You knew how powerful she was... ...and how much she loved you. You hugged her, looked into her eyes. Do you know how precious those moments are? I never knew my mother. My mom died while giving birth to me. When she was 16 years old. My condolences. Thank you. Did you know we came here from Belgrade? With my aunt? Can you believe my name was Olga? Olga. Really? Muhterem? I chose it myself. Yes. It means respected. Life... ...has been so rude to me... ...so I thought things would change if I took on this name. How about your father? My father... ...he left us before I was born. He left me.

I'm too tired to believe in anyone. And I have no one at all. I don’t have time for games either, I have past that age. I was never that age. And I will probably die before I reach it. So don't talk to me about games. - Call it something else? - What should I call it? Say that you will die with me? Do you know how old I am? So what? I was dead and came back from death. Don’t speak of promises you can’t keep. Muhterem! There are so many women around you... ...but you keep on chasing me. Why? Tell me why? - Let me speak for a second! - Why me? Give me a second!

Shall we sing together? - Are you done with the shoot? - Yes. Tomorrow is the recording. I will be singing. Will you come with me? What am I supposed to do there? You will just stand there... ...and I will look into your eyes... ...and sing. I will do what I couldn't do when I was young. What a beautiful man you are. All this pain and suffering Has cruel fate given them to me? All this pain and suffering Has cruel fate given them to me?

Muslum, say something! Don’t you care about me at all? Let me go! I would never leave you. And you never leave me. Never. I do. I am walking on the streets Some people are coming some are going I see people Some laugh some cry Hopeless people Without hope Only the ones who suffer Will understand my song Only the ones who live everyday while dying Only the ones who live everyday while dying All my friends are gone I am all alone now How wounded I was By friends I loved By friends I loved Only the ones who suffer Will understand my song Only the ones who live everyday while dying Muslum. What if you live to regret this? What if you want a child later on? What is my name? Muslum. Who? Muslum who? Who? Muslum "father". I am already a father. Muslum "father"! Father!

That's enough! Make some space. Bahtiyar, they are going to bring this place down. Shall we cancel the concert? If I cancel the concert, they will cut us not themselves. The mountains who make us long for each other And don’t allow us to be together They should be ashamed The roads that separate us Should be ashamed Let him go. It is the greatest yearning when my love is not by my side I am amazed at a life spent without passion. Surely it will die if not blossomed Branches full of flowers should be ashamed Please do not hurt yourselves and each other. Please, don't. Who spreads the word of this love? I rebel to luck and fate Even though mirrors make me look old Years gone to waste should be ashamed Be ashamed You are too kind. You are the greatest! I'd give my life for you all. Muslum Gurses would give his life for you. Father! Father! Father! Emergency Room Come here son. Let him. Forgive me father. What did you do, son?

Let's go then. We're leaving. Watch out. Mr. Muslum, get well soon. What are your opinions on your ban on TRT? Thank you. What about the people who cut themselves with razors? They are mourning. Let's go Bahtiyar. Make way! Mr. Muslum, one last question! You mourn in such a way... ...that your entire life passes by. It's over! It's over! Take it easy. I'll bring you some clean clothes. Muhterem? You don't remember anything, do you? You know how my mother died, don't you? As she was giving birth to me. That’s why I owe her. No matter what... ...I will not be sad in this life. Can you feel it? Can you feel how much I love you? Look here. Look. I can endure this until my death. I can take it. You grab me by my hair and bang my head against the walls. Then I will cut this hair. Completely. You won’t be able to find hair to grab. Did you kill your mother, sister and brother? Your mother, your siblings... ...even those boys who call you father don’t blame you. Because you haven’t done anything wrong. Accept it. You have to learn to be happy. Muslum... ...you will either learn it or kill me. You are not your father... ...and I'm not your mother, either. Brother, open the door. Please! Open the door, please! Why did you let him in? Why did you let him in? They won’t let her marry me. They said they wouldn’t give their daughter away to the son of a murderer. I can’t be without her. I will challenge anyone who stands in my way. Ahmet. 11 YEARS EARLIER Eat some apple. Eat something. She is not eating anything. Did you desert the army? Uniform looks good on you. You son of a bitch! You turned me in!

Drop the weapon! He's got a weapon! He's got a weapon! He's got a weapon! Drop the weapon! Ahmet! Surrender! I could not reason with him. He went completely mad. He even tried to kill me. They forced the girl to marry someone else. He was planning to run away with her... ...and get married. I told him to leave her. I told him her family would cause us so much trouble. And I would have to deal with it later on. Then... ...I thought I could report him to gendarmerie. I talked to the chief... ...and told him to call gendarmerie. And when they surrounded the house... How was I supposed to know? If I had known it would end this way, I wouldn’t have called the gendarmerie. Open your palm. Open it. Open your palm! I've been drunk for the past 25 years. I'm a wreck. I’ve fallen to pieces. I was shattered. Remember that song? What song? The song I prevented you from singing. Why do you mention it now? Well... Come on, sing it to me. Let me listen to it. You are not far away You are the blood inside my veins I can’t live without you You are my everything If you wish, I would be your vassal If you wish, kill me Muslum... ...promise me something. After I die, you'll take good care of yourself. Okay? No! You can't die before I do. Muslum. Mrs. Muhterem. Deal. Mrs. Muhterem... ...everyone is born in heaven... ...some people grow up in hell. Like me. HARBIYE OPEN AIR CONCERT He could never become a father. He was afraid he would become like his father. But everyone called him "Father". The hand of time brushed us Everything changed a long time ago We are not the same, the two of us To your weaknesses, I gave one night To your mistakes, a lotus flower To your ruthlessness, a heart Give me back now You can’t give back what you have taken from me Give me back Delusions can’t be given back Entrust what is left of me to my absence Take everything. Give myself back to me so that I have this one chance MUSLUM GURSES PASSED AWAY IN 2013. In some other place, in some other time Let me have a life without you Take everything so that I have this one chance THROUGHOUT HIS 44-YEAR CAREER... ...HE MADE MORE THAN 80 ALBUMS AND STARRED IN 38 MOVIES. HIS FANS REFER TO HIM AS "THE FATHER OF THE FATHERS"... ...AND HE WILL FOREVER BE REMEMBERED AS SUCH. FANS' LAST WORDS FOR THEIR FATHER WERE;... "WHEN WE SAID YOU LOOKED GOOD IN WHITE, WE DIDN'T MEAN IN A SHROUD." I leave with respect. For now. Farewell. Goodbye. LIFE WAS DIFFICULT BUT BEAUTIFUL. GIVE ME YOUR BLESSINGS... Did I get the message across? Everyone says; "Father left us." He didn't leave anyone. He left us the world itself. I can't explain how nice and kind he was. I learned so much from him. He was even so kind to people who treated him badly. Most important thing was that I had given my heart to Mrs. Muhterem. What else can possibly be given? Of course, I miss him. I wish he were here. I don't want anything else I just wish he were here.
