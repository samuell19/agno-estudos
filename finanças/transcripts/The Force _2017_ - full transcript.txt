...that occurred at six two zero zero Seminary on 28... Two of them armed. Details are coming in pretty slow. 3029. I’ll be nine RT. ...Copy. Four-fifteen gunshots being called in at eight four and International. Eight four and International. Just came in. So, you guys had a really long night. Pace yourselves. Do the best you can with it. Take care of each other and I’ll see you guys out there. It’s a very difficult time in this country to be a police officer. This is the fourth shooting in two months, by the Oakland Police Department, of black men. We don't know the story. Don’t nobody know the story of what happened. I’ve got bad information that’s out there and it’s causing anger, which is leading to the protest that we saw. A major metropolitan police department facing a prostitution scandal. The department had already been under federal monitoring for allegations of evidence tampering and brutality, and the city has one of the highest crime rates in the country. We want you to help us to fix this community, to fix the system. Where is the trust? There’s no relationship without trust. ...both suspects were armed. It’s going to be a 916. Two adam three four is going to be en route to relieve 1031... This police department has a history that we have to own up to. It’s our legacy. A coalition of community groups is calling for greater accountability... Members of the public and city officials are fast losing faith, This department is starting to feel, to a lot of people, like a house of cards. We recognize that even the suspicion of misconduct can damage the trust that we have worked so hard to rebuild in this community. Once these doors open before we go out, let them know who we are. All right, guys, it’s been a fun ride. I love every single one of you guys, and now the journey begins. Let’s go to prayer. Heavenly Father, we come before your presence this morning. We thank you for giving us another day of life. We thank you for all your blessings, for allowing us to be in the 170th academy and I pray your angels will go with us, that they will ride next to us, that you would keep us safe, along with the entire department. Lord, I pray for our families, Lord, wives, husbands, children, Lord, and I thank you. Let us enjoy this day. This is our day and we thank you. In the name of Jesus, we pray. Amen. All right. All right. Listen up, y’all. Who are we? One Seventy! - Who are we? - One Seventy! - And here we go! - Here we go! - Here we go! - Here we go! - Here we go! - Here we go! - And here we go! - Here we go! - Who are we? - Who are we? - One seventy! - One seventy! - Who are we? - Who are we? - OPD! - OPD! High value. High character. Integrity. All of these things we want in each one of you. And that’s why you’re here. Each one of you has those things, today. You have those things today. Now all of you came in here for the right reason. You all... wanted to join the Oakland Police Department to do the right thing, right? You all want to help make Oakland safer, right? And everybody that sat in the seats before you felt the same way. Now on day one, when you hit the streets, things are going to get a little bit different. The badge you now wear on your chest is a symbol of the public’s trust. The actions of a single police officer, on or off duty, anywhere in the country, reflect on all of us. We must conduct ourselves ethically at all times in order to remain worthy of the public’s trust. Now, that’s an enormous amount of responsibility, but that’s just the reality that we work in. And you have to understand that. When you see this right here, what does this mean? That people are going to walk up to you and do like this... Why do people do that? Why do people do that? Our graduates are entering into a profession in the throes of change, joining a police department that is in an unyielding pursuit of community trust, committed to realizing our collective vision of a healthy Oakland that fosters... The minute you put that uniform on, you represent all of us. So, today, if Jenkins... tells a citizen, "You’re an asshole," that means tomorrow, when Wilson comes, what are they going to think, right? They’re going to think Wilson is just as-- unprofessional as Jenkins was, right? What are they going to expect from you? They’re going to expect for you to respond just like she did, right? So, your behavior has an impact on all of us. That you might think, "I’m just a lowly police office." Until you do something wrong, then you’re the YouTube sensation. One police officer. One police officer can affect the credibility of a department, of a city. One police officer... can have an impact on this whole country. The St. Louis County grand jury declined to indict Officer Darren Wilson, 28, for firing six shots in an August confrontation that murdered 18-year-old Michael Brown. The decision had been long awaited in this predominantly black suburb of St. Louis. We will try to facilitate protests today to the best of our ability, um, but what we will not tolerate is massive destruction downtown, and we certainly will not tolerate assaults on our staff. I just hope that even in some of the negative expressions that might come out tonight, that we might continue to embrace this reality that it is not representative and I believe we know this, of all of the community. We want to work together to see the city that we all want to live in. Hands up! Don’t shoot! I hereby declare this - to be an unlawful assembly. - You are to blame. - You are to blame. - And in the name of the people - of the State of California... - Bring more. Robots on top of robots. We got heart. We got soul. We got faith. Bring more robots. We’re not scared of shit. - Whose streets? - Our streets! -Whose streets? -Our streets! -Whose fucking streets? -Our streets. -Whose streets? -Our streets. It’s 2014 and we still got to fight against racism, against police brutality. Fuck the police! Fuck you, you pigs! No justice, no peace. No racist police. No justice, no peace. No racist police. No justice, no peace. No racist police. But is the plan to arrest them or cite them? I don’t know, but I mean, how do we cite those people out? It’s going to be a mess. Hold on. Freddy is calling me, alright. I’m going to find out what’s up with that murder out east. I’ll call you back. Hey, what happened out there? We looked at his body when his clothes were off. Not a lot of gang tats that we could really recognize. So... But, there’s no doubt, it was a hit. Yeah. Clearly. -It was a hit. Right now-- -How many rounds fired? - Right now it’s up to 12 casings. - Ooh. Yeah, right in, right up in-- right up close and personal. And we have a good description on the car, too. Right up at the store here, we looked at-- We’re looking for cameras up there. We can get some cameras up there. We’re looking at the video to see if we can see... if we see the car. So that puts us at 74 for the year. Justice! - When do we want it? - Now. -What do we want? -Justice! - When do we want it? - Now. - What do we want? - Justice. -When do we want it? -Now. - What do we want? - Justice. You guys good? - Yes, sir. - You feeling it? - Yes, sir. - All right, here we go. POT Newsome, 9222. Everything I talked about in the classroom, panic, fear, and anxiety, this is it right here. You gotta defeat it, your mindset, you’re a warrior, you have to survive. You don’t have the right to panic. You don’t have that luxury. You get one chance to get it right. Panicking under pressure will get you dead. - Yes, sir. - That’s what it will get you. It’ll get somebody else hurt. One of your partners hurt, a citizen hurt. You don’t have the right to panic. Pull it together. Let’s go. Last but not least. POT Loya, 9292. Clear. Breathe. You’ve got to breathe. Nope. Nope. Nope. Breathe. Inhale. Exhale. Inhale and exhale. Exhale. Exhale. He was holding him. He was telling him to breathe and everything. He just freaked out and grabbed the door. He didn’t get his mask back on. He was just standing there with his mask off. You know you’re going to have to go again, right? -Yeah. -Okay. That was rough, dude. ...any update, I’ll be pulling up in about a minute. Twenty-seven, he’s GOA on... Foothill towards High Street in the Chrysler 300. Actually, they say he’s back on scene. He’s back on scene now. Copy. Pulling up. Hey, where’s he at? Where is he? What’s going on? Okay, go over there. What’s going on? Why don’t you go stand over there? I am. Is it him? Who called? Who called? Twenty-seven! Westbound Foothill. Code 33. He’s running right at you, whoever’s coming towards me. Right there. Don’t move! Don’t move! Don’t move! Do not move! -If you could turn that way for me? -Yeah. We have to get photographs. So, I guess it’s all over a tire. He goes up to them and pushes one guy and then another guy he shoves back, tries running off with the rim or whatever and then they kind of grab it, and he takes off running. Then he comes back and that’s when I pull up. Okay, so do you want to walk me through really quickly? -Yeah. So, I pull up on the scene. -Okay. Um, the guy kind of walks up to me all chilly like, you know, "They took my rim," or something like that. -Okay. -And I was like, "All right, I’ll talk to you in one second." I look over at them and I’m like "Hey, who called?" Was it him? Who called? Who called? Twenty-seven! Westbound Foothill! Code 33! Male, white, long hair, gray hoodie, blue jeans, black shoes. -Takes off running. -Okay. Runs through the parking lot, and runs eastbound, runs across the street like he’s going to run southbound 36 or 35. Sees a car coming up. Then bounces back this way. Jumps to the fence right where the ambulance was. Okay. I pulled out my taser. Don’t move! Don’t move! Don’t move! I'm not moving! 27, I got a taser deployment. I was going to try to tase him while he was jumping the fence, but he jumped over the fence too quick. So, I kind of hopped up onto the fence and then kind of shot down at him. -Okay. -He’s saying that he didn’t get tased. -Okay. -He refused medical but we’re still going to transport him to get clear anyway. Okay. Sounds good. And I already got photographs of him. Yeah, I got photographs of the few little scuffs he had, but I didn’t see anything and he didn’t say anything about the probes hitting him. So... Okay, so I’m going to start up here. I’m going to photo the overall scene. Pick your stuff up, come back, -get your victim and then... -Do you want me to... leave my taser on the floor where I... Yeah, whatever is down there, -just leave it there. Okay? -Okay. -All right. -We good? Okay. Sounds good. ...51 in custody. Car pulls right over. You point a firearm at the driver. Get out of the car. Take him into custody. You just had use of force. You pointed a firearm at somebody. You had a use of force. You’ve got to justify why it is you pointed a firearm at somebody. You have to complete a use of force report. They don’t show you this on the recruiting poster. You go into recruiting and they’ve got... they’ve got the motorcycle, and the helicopter, and all of the cool stuff. They do not show you somebody sitting for hours on end in the report writing room writing stuff down. It’s not the sexy side of the job. But it really is important, um, and it’s absolutely in line with what the national discussion is right now. Police departments are having to document why they do the things that they do, and rightfully so. Remember, we are the government. The nation was founded... on the fundamental belief of a mistrust in government. That’s what the Bill of Rights comes from. At the core of the foundation of this nation is a mistrust of government. And we are the most visible sign of that government. We drive around in a black and white car with flashing lights on it, and wear a uniform with a bright star. We give you tremendous authority, and a gun. It’s not unreasonable for people to expect you to be explaining why you do the things that you do. But in the context of a lawsuit alleging civil rights violations where it was alleged that we were stopping people for no reason, searching them for no reason, sometimes taking them to jail for no reason, or made up reasons, you understand why there is the level of scrutiny that there is. Related to that, you are required to report misconduct. I don’t want bad cops here. Period. I don’t need them. So this is your blue wall of silence bullshit that people talk about. We don’t have a blue wall of silence. No more. It doesn’t exist anymore. You are required to report class 1 misconduct. Everything is either class 1 or class 2. Class 1 are the serious offenses. That’s your planting evidence, excessive force, lying in a police report, sexual harassment, discrimination. Failure to report class 1 misconduct is, in and of itself, a class 1 misconduct. Okay? You are required to report misconduct. How can people trust the police department if we’ve got people out doing stuff they’re not supposed to be doing? I don’t need them. They can go. So much of what we do here is affected by our relationship with the community. I just heard the six shots and I called as soon as it was over... Well, I had to lock my door because I don’t want them in here. They’re threatening all of us. My grandma is here, my son is here. ...shots fired in the area of 19th and Foothill. What’s going on at 65th and International? Nothing now. Y’all are too late. Hi, this is the Oakland Police Department. Somebody dialed 911. Is there an emergency there? I’m sorry, 85th and East 14th? Is this a pay phone? It is. Is he out there alone? And do you see any... ...I ain’t never borrowed no rhyme no rhythm... I shall not... Because it’s so late and we do have quite a few calls standing, I think it’s going to be a bit longer for the wait. This is going to make me worse. I put up with this my whole life. ...and I’m trying to call my brother and say, "Come down here," because I don’t know what he going to do to me or to her. ...on the vehicles, but I don’t have a DOS. So it looks like the two victims will be there on scene for contact. Okay. Okay. Take a deep breath. Okay. He put you in the car? All right, I’m going to stay on the phone with you, okay? We’re going to get an officer to you there. I’m trying to get one for you now. I just want to make sure that they can find you. The mission tonight is to arrest those individuals that are in violation of prostitution related offenses and most importantly, to rescue those victims of human trafficking. So, we have assistance for you, to help you out if you want help. Okay? He started threatening the girl. He pointed at her... gunpoint. No. No. No. So, you’re not working OT this week? I don’t know. I’m exhausted. Dude, I’m trying to sign up, man, to do the Raider’s game. So, Raider’s before. Dude. Okay, what if it’s a night like yesterday? But it’s a short week, though. It’s a short week. Still though, what if it’s a night like yesterday? Dude, I didn’t get off until five this morning. Bro, I slept through all my alarm clocks. I woke up late and I was hella mad. I was like half asleep driving in. Take off the earpiece. All right, we’ll I’m gonna go type, man. I’ll see you guys in there. See you in a couple of hours. Everyone in here knows we don’t have enough police. Like no one in here doesn’t acknowledge that, but share with us what we can expect, so that we know how to then respond and support you, because we do call and then we don’t get responses. People do report and then there’s nothing that happens. So, then that makes them stop, and that’s what we’re trying to get the community not to do. Yeah, no. That is by far the number one complaint of the Oakland Police Department is response time, and rightfully so. And we’ve had a lot of vacancies in patrol and we fill those on an overtime basis. But I mean, looking at it, we’ve had major reductions in burglaries in the last several years, particularly... residential burglaries are way, way, way, - way down from what they used to be. - What? Residential burglaries, way down. Well, where were they when they broke in my house? I called screaming and crying. You know what they asked? They asked me, "Anybody in there?" Why am I going to go in the house and see if anybody in there? Then, you’re going to tell me, "We can’t get nobody out there for three days." What they do? They came and broke in the next neighbor house 'cause they know you’re not coming out there. - Yep, that’s right. - Right. Well, all right. So, I mean... that’s the reality of the situation, is that the guys out there, particularly on the swing shift, will literally go call to call for their entire 12-hour shift, every day, never getting a lunch break in the process, I mean, it’s every single day, and never even come close to answering all the calls that are standing. It absolutely has been the case since I was a beat cop and it hasn’t changed now. We are trying to address that. I mean, is it good enough? No. Of course, it’s not good enough. Should you be satisfied? No, you shouldn’t be satisfied. Absolutely not. I mean, and I’ll be the first one to tell you that, do we provide the level of service that we want to provide? No. Is it the level of service that you deserve? No. But... we do the best that we can, and, and we ask a whole lot from those officers. But the best... your best ain’t good enough. Ma’am, I apologize for that. That ain’t gonna bring my stuff back. No, it’s not gonna bring your stuff back, but at this point, I mean I don’t... You need more patrols. I don’t want to give you a false promise. I don’t want to say, "It will never happen again." The last thing I want to do is come in here and lie to you. I want to be very genuine about it. I completely... admit the... that we need to do a better job, no doubt. And we are trying to do a better job. But, our priority is... is violent crime. I mean we... top priority is protecting people’s lives, saving human lives. And so, I mean we...we take some flak for that sometimes, and... and not so much here. I take flak for that sometimes in the hills and other places, where people are very, very concerned about the occasional car break in or something. And... and granted, I mean, that’s not a good thing by any stretch, but I can’t prioritize somebody’s... broken car window over somebody getting killed on our streets. So, basically, what we’re looking at right now is a stabbing scene. We have full names on both. I'm working on getting photos. And then, we’ve got... basically, this is right in front of 87th, Where she at? Where was... In the house. I got her in the house. All right, just finish giving this guy a statement. Hey, Joe. Can you make sure they don’t let that girl go? -I know she’s been trying to leave. -All right. - She saw the whole thing. - Yeah? -The dude is taking a statement from her. -Okay. I just don’t want her to leave without homicide talking to her. -Yes. -And then, I’ll talk to the other girl. Your response system ain’t fast enough. Okay, put it on there that your response ain’t fast enough-- No, you need to let them know-- You said that half of y’all didn’t even get the call. So, that. Exactly. So, you need to put that in there. Somebody went and got the police. So that’s your daughter? She can’t go to the store. - Nah, you can’t go to the store right now. - Nah... He said ya’ll can’t go right now. It’s a crime scene. You can’t leave right now. What you need? Nothing, mom. Dude, there ain’t no cops showed up to this, dude. Well, the canvassing needs to be done all over here, but some of these people need to have statements taken from them, as well. Hey, Joe, I got some people coming from our squad. You’re a bitch. You’re a bitch. You’re a bitch. Get out of my face, bitch. Next time I see you... How you doing? Were you guys out here today when this happened? Nah. Damn, this guy's like I killed the man. Shit. Nah, we don’t think that you killed him. I got to go. Time is ticking. All right, so when people die, right, it’s not just like a regular thing. Everybody out here knows who did it. -I get why you all want the statement. -Listen to me though. Like, why you acting like that, like we got a warrant? -We don’t even give a shit. He's just... -I don’t have a warrant. I’m clear. -All I’m trying to figure out here... -He just wanted-- say that Why you want a statement from me when I wasn’t here? Because you were here when we got here, and while you’re on the scene, -you have to give a statement, listen-- -So, everybody out here -has to give a statement? -Yes, that’s why I called for more cops to come. -Okay. So, let me give my statement-- -All your statement has to say is, "I wasn’t here. I didn’t see shit." -Okay. Cool. -You know what I’m saying? -Perfect. -We good? We good. I just want to go. I got to be school at 3 o’clock. -All right. -You’re holding me up. I just want to go. -All right. -That’s what I’m told. -Get my key so I can go. -Why y'all messing around her? We ain’t messing with nobody! Good morning. Good morning, ma’am. My name is Libby Schaaf. Today is my first official day as the mayor of the City of Oakland. Um, thank you. Thank you for coming here to serve this incredible city. I just came to say that I have your backs. You all are here and doing this at a pretty interesting time in our nation’s history. And so, I hope that you are excited about being part of a change, a transformation, where I am... incredibly hopeful and confident that we can be a city that gets this right and creates a lot more understanding between law enforcement and the community. We need each and every one of you to get out on the streets and make this city safer. This department is stressed. It works too hard and that’s because it does not have enough officers on the street. I said I will have your back. That does not mean that I will put up with mess, that I will put up with inappropriate behavior. Um, my expectations, obviously, are very high. But I really respect law enforcement. I really respect the career that you have chosen. It’s the highest calling. It’s a career of incredible sacrifice. So, thank you and I look forward to seeing you all at your graduation. All right? Thanks. - Hello, Chief. - Hi. How are you? Nice to meet you. People talk about, "It’s the new Oakland Police Department. It’s the new this. It’s the new that." Things are very, very... So, he has to talk about it. And he will talk about that. So we do a story of the way that you-- Your new approach of training - and policing. - Yeah. And see the results, and... ...it’s kind of new compared to other police departments. Yeah, we’re a little ahead of a few people. And we still have more work to do. We still have the road to go. This is not over with. And we, We, as a department and we, as a city, understand that. We need to... Are you still under federal oversight? Yes. And so now you’ve done... -a lot of progress. -Yeah, we’re really down to just a couple of things and we’re about to finish that up. So, we’re getting close. -But does our community feel like -Yeah. -we are a changed department? -Yeah, their point of view. Does our community-- Right. Do they trust us? The way they see you, yeah. Not everybody is always going to trust the police. But is there a different relationship? I think in many ways, we are an example of how you can really change. I mean, it’s a police department that had a reputation, for being very aggressive, and having a lot of problems with the community and that is absolutely changing and we’re proud of that. And that we believe that body worn cameras is a big part of that. I think that cops behave better, but I also think the people that are being filmed behave better. So, I think it has a civilizing effect on both ends of the camera. Did you obtain some results? Well, we have not had a fatal officer-involved-shooting in... two years. Historically, we average about eight officer involved shootings a year. Not all fatal, but eight shootings a year. In 2014, we didn’t have any at all. So, we’ve seen those very high levels of uses of force come down. We’ve also seen lower level uses of force come down. - Off the pigs! - No more pigs in our community! - Off the pigs! - No more pigs in our community! - Off the pigs! - No more pigs in our community! I think that the Black Panthers raised a very significant issue and that was the brutality of the police when they came into the black community. Today, there is a whole new relationship developing between the people of Oakland’s ghettos and the police. Police officials hold regular meetings in the community and they are well received. This is one of the greatest things I’ve seen in Oakland in my 30 years here. I never thought I’d see the day, back in ’47, ’48, I could see policemen come, and sit down, and let you criticize ‘em. It’s our responsibility to get out in that community and we’ll be here if you want us. And I’m here, quite frankly, to assure you that those men that you see sitting here, and the men that work 24 hours a day, seven days a week in the Oakland Police Department, will be striving to achieve a goal that they’re going to take a humanistic approach to policing. I want to see every citizen treated with dignity. That was 40 years ago. Forty years ago, they were still-- They were talking about treating people with dignity and respect. They were talking about that 40 years ago. So, I was born and raised in Oakland. I was born and raised in West Oakland, right there where the Black Panthers had started. And so, in my community, you know, it wasn’t... you wasn’t... viewed-- Police officers wasn’t viewed as something positive in the community, right? We were raised to stay as far away from them as you can, right? We used to run from the police just because we would see them, right? We’d just be like, "My God, they’re going to do something to us. Let’s run." Right? This is how you were raised. This is what you were told. That’s based on the history of this city. That’s based on the experiences of black people in this city. The emergence of policing in the South, initially, were slave patrols, to chase down runaway slaves, to keep black folks in line. You come through the period, even out of that, into the time of the emergence of the Jim Crow system and lynching. Often times, police were dispatched to lynchings to keep them civil. We come even down further through that period and you come into segregation, where police were used to actually bring out the canine units and sic them on protesters who were trying to fight for their rights. When the incident happened in Ferguson, the City of Oakland, we had protests for weeks upon weeks. They protested longer in Oakland than they did in Ferguson. That’s based on the history of this city. That’s based on the experiences of people in this city. This community has had instances that they can point to, that affects the way they view you. Not you as an individual, but you in that police uniform. The Oakland Police Department has a history... that’s been contentious with this community. Although some of us might say, "That didn’t have anything to do with me. Man, all that stuff was hella long time ago," but what I’m lifting up is the past stole your identity and ran up an incredibly high bill. And so many of us might show up in this story and be like, "It’s all BS, these folks complaining about stuff, these folks just making a mountain out of a molehill," but the past stole your identity and it has run up an incredibly high bill. And everything that we do is either going to help run that bill up or it’s going to bring that bill down. Get on the ground! Get on the ground! Get on the ground! He's got a gun! Drop it! Drop it! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! This is the fourth shooting in two months, by the Oakland Police Department of black men. I know we’re tired, um, but we’re going to open this space by pouring libation. It’s an African tradition of honoring our ancestors, connecting us back to the earth. And y'all are going to have to forgive me. Um... I’m a little raw today. We pour libation for our ancestral fathers. - Ashe. - Ashe. We pour libation for our ancestral mothers. Ashe. We pour libation for all of the stolen lives. Ashe. Specifically, we call out the names of Oscar Grant. Ashe. - Alan Bluford. - Ashe. - Yvette Henderson. - Ashe. - George Jackson. - Ashe. - Natasha McKenna. - Ashe. - Sandra Bland. - Ashe. - Nate Wilks. - Ashe. - Ashe. - Ashe. - Ashe. - Ashe. - Ashe. - Ashe. Today we trying to figure out how to hold these cops accountable, how to make them do their job the way that we, as the people, feel that they should be doing their job. They should respect every human being. It was all love with him. He was full of life, full of love, full of passion. And I speak for my sister when I say she appreciates it, she feels the love. It’s a little bit hard for her to talk right now, as any of you could imagine. So, thank you again. We appreciate the love. Thank you. Thank you. It’s a grim reminder of the deadly incident that began at 69th and International. Police say that’s where an officer tried to stop a car that was involved in a July armed robbery. They say he led them on a car chase, then attempted a carjacking before leading officers on another chase, this time on foot. And three officers confronted him, ordering him to drop his gun. Police say officers opened fire when he advanced towards them while holding a pistol in his hand. There’s a critical part of this process is to beat back the State’s narrative about how we die, because they’re usually not telling the truth. And so they knew... they knew that this was two in a week. They knew that we were going to be in these streets, and so they are actively working to shut us down. They’re actively working to discredit us. Demonstrators have already announced that they’re going to have a march tonight in response to this, saying this is just another shooting in what they think is a pattern of this kind of thing by Oakland Police. What would you say to them and to the public that might be doubting whether this was in any way justified? Well... at this point, we haven’t decided if it was justified or not, right? The investigation does take a period of time. We have a very good sense of what happened due to the body worn cameras. Um, but, we have had more officer-involved shootings than we had last year, certainly, and that’s very unfortunate. But many of these have involved armed people and several of them have actually resulted in injuries to officers. So, it’s a very dangerous profession and these things do happen. Running away from the police is actually a logical reaction. It’s a rational reaction. I would even argue it’s self-preservation, right? That still doesn’t mean you get to shoot him in the back. Police say the coroner’s preliminary autopsy report shows Wilks was shot in the front of the body, but those who knew Wilks don’t believe it. They want proof. We want the chest cam video. We want to get a second autopsy. We want this to stop. Chief, how challenging is it in this environment where, you know, we’re out there today, there’s a lot of hostility, Johnna saw it, um, where there are a lot of people there who just assume that everything is unjustified? I mean, are you training around that? Is there some second guessing going on? Are you concerned that there could be second guessing? Well, I think is something that’s on the mind of police officers. They know they’re going to be second guessed, but it’s... it’s a very difficult time in, in this country to be a police officer. But we provide a lot of training to our officers, and I think that day in and day out they do an amazing job here. All right, thanks. That concludes our portion of the press conference. We will send out an updated release with the information discussed here. -Whose streets? -Our streets. -Whose streets? -Our streets. -Whose streets? -Our streets. -Whose streets? -Our streets. -Whose streets? -Our streets. -Whose streets? -Our streets. Attention, this is the Oakland Police Department. You have the right to a peaceful assembly and to express your First Amendment rights. We are here to facilitate your march... You are unlawful! You are unlawful! Any unlawful actions, malice, trespassing or violence will not tolerated. Violators will be subject to arrest. So, I’m going to show you a video of what happened in Modesto a few years ago. You’re going to see the dash cam video for the officer. So, the sound will kick in here pretty soon. So, this is the officer now, seeing him pull into his driveway. Hands up! Hands up, Ernie! Don’t you move! Ernie, don’t you move or I will shoot you! Hands up, now! Drop the gun, now! Shots fired! Shots fired! What the fuck? On the ground now! - No! - On the ground! Get back now! No! Shots fired. Suspect armed with a gun. Stay in control. All right, do you need me to rewind it? Yes, sir. Hands up or I will shoot you! Hands up! Now! Look how many commands he gives. He’s reaching... Look at him! Wait. Wait. Wait. Look at him. He’s still trying to do something right now. He took the time to... ...20 times or whatever. And again, we don’t shoot to kill, we shoot to neutralize the threat. -And that’s what he did. -If he had a knife, and he’s on the ground gasping for air, facing away from the officer, isn’t that threat neutralized? That’s all that was recovered and that we know of now. At the time... Come on, you have to give me at least that you see the difference between shooting someone once and 13 times. -You know. We’ve had classes-- -I don’t know if I’m right, but honestly, I don’t see nothing wrong... -You don’t see a difference between-- -I felt that was necessary. I felt that was necessary. If I get my baton out, I hit you in the head with it once, should I... can I just as well hit you 12 more times? But I... I just don’t like that... that... it sounds like, when people are like, "Why did the officer have to do that so many times? Why did the officer have to do that so many times," I think... as... as much as an officer needs to neutralize the threat. The reason why I show all these controversial things in this academy, I want you to make a lot of mistakes in this room, a lot of them. I just want it to happen in this room versus when you graduate and hit the street. Why is he moving so fast? Why does he have a weapon? What do you think he’s doing with that knife? He’s giving commands the whole time, saying, "Hey, don’t move, don’t get up, don’t try to run away, don’t flee, don’t do that, stop, stop." The guy is still moving. He doesn’t know if he’s neutralized or not. -But if he’s-- -I’m with you, man. I’m not getting stabbed. I’ll tell you that right now. I’m not getting stabbed. I’m not getting stabbed. I want to go home at the end of my shift to my family. The reason why I say that is because he’s moving. What if he’s grabbing a gun and shooting? You don’t think that someone can shoot you from the ground? That’s not what I said. He has a knife, not a gun. He said, "Drop the knife." Listen. You don’t know what he had. -He hasn’t searched him. -Can I finish a fucking sentence? You don’t know if he’s on drugs or not. How many rounds does it take to stop somebody on drugs? - My point is we fire pea shooters. - But it’s different-- Thirteen shots may not stop somebody. You don’t know that. He’s squirming on the ground. He might be reaching for something else. You don’t know that. But wait, he’s injured. Now, I say, if he starts making a-- So you’re going to go, "Okay, index assess, okay, index assess." No. I’m going to shoot him until he’s... -He has a knife. -Right. The guy can’t roll over with a knife and kill me. He could have thrown it at him. We invited you here this morning to view this video because both of the two incidents that you watched, unfortunately, have gathered... a fair amount of misinformation’s been put out there. We’re trying to fix a local problem. Locally here, I’ve got bad information that’s out there and it’s causing anger, which is leading to the protest kind of stuff that we saw. So... so, that’s what I’m trying to correct. Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! Drop the gun! So, by showing the video what do you want us to take away from that? Well, I guess what I would hope is that some of the misinformation... there was... said that he was shot in the back, or was down on the ground at the time he was shot, various things that we’ve seen play out on social media, and... and from some witnesses that various news media talked to said things that clearly did not happen. Male, black, 30s, a red t-shirt and blue jeans. I got eyes on him. He’s wedged in here. Hey, can we get down there? Hey, let’s get another unit over here to help. So, I think it will be really interesting to see what happens at today’s event. You know, there’s going to be media there, likely the same media that watched the video, and it’s going to be difficult for them to say that these heinous things happened to him in our custody when we know, in fact, none of that happened. Were they covering up his head and they were still beating him? Did they choke him to death? What did they do? Hey, we’re secure for medical. So, in that time, you said you wanted to know what happened in that 30 minutes. Police are telling us that in that 30-minute period while they were searching for him, they had no contact with him. That’s why the video doesn’t exist. They only found him. And that’s what we saw. I don’t believe that. I don’t believe that to be the case. I don’t believe that to be true. Are you insinuating that there’s possibly a whole conspiracy involving the entire department and the coroner’s office? - Yes. Yes. - Yes. Yes. Everybody here want to know what happened. That’s what I’m here for. I want some justice. I want some peace, and I want to know the real story, and them video cams, I want to see the whole video cam. I don’t want to see no cut versions. I don’t want to see anything like that. I want to see the whole video cam recording. No justice. No peace. It’s been going on. It’s been police brutality. It’s been all that’s going on with the black against the white people. It's nothing new. You all know about this. It’s been in the history books. So, ain’t no justice, ain't no peace. It’s as simple as that. What do you think the role of body cameras are? In this case, it seems like they’re being used to show your narrative of a certain situation. I don’t know that it’s necessarily our narrative. I mean, it is what occurred, right? So, I mean the body worn camera is very good evidence of what happened out there. So, there is a transparency aspect to it. There’s an accountability aspect to it. Some people are just going to live in this polarized world where they want to continue to make it like a "us versus them" in a narrative situation and that’s just not what we’re trying to do. We’re not trying to jump to conclusions. We’re not trying to steer anyone else into conclusions. We just want to show it and it is what happened. And this could work against us, too. I mean, we could have one that was bad -and it wouldn’t be... -Of course. It wouldn’t be our narrative of... either. It would just be, "this is what occurred." I mean, it’s ugly. And sooner or later, someday, we will have an ugly one. I mean, some officer is going to make a bad decision someday, and it’s going to be... it’s going to be ugly, but, um... -you know, it can happen. -Right. Are you still feeling okay? Are you feeling dizzy at all? - Anything like that? - No. Okay, well, you hear the fire engine? It’s coming right now, okay? They’re going to get you all bandaged up, all right? Okay. I promise they’re going to take care of you, okay. Where do you live at? Right there at the light. -You live on Bancroft? -Yes. Do you know what happened to you right now? -Yeah, I fell. -You fell? Did you get hit by a car or did you fall? -No, I just fell. -Are you sure? -Yeah. -Okay, how did you fall? I don’t know. It’s car versus ped. She thinks she fell but she actually got hit by a car. Okay. Okay, and what was your um... -Okay. -Darlin’, are you all right? That nigga in that black Benz hit you? No, Chris! Hey! Hey! Hey, you better relax right now. Relax! -Man, I’m not doing... -Relax. -I’m not doing nothing. -Okay, why you gotta -approach him like that? Relax. -For real? Okay? Hey, TAC 41, can I get one more unit over here, please? How the fuck she fine if she bleedin’? The victim’s brother is on scene and he’s not cooperative. Nigga, I don’t give a fuck about you, nigga. As a matter of fact... Hey! Hey! Hey! 2 TAC 41, he just took off, running westbound. Any description? Male, black, in pajama pants. No shirt. Bald. Extremely confrontational. Do you have your ID on your not, sir? I just had it. I just gave it to the officer. - Does he have it still, or-- - Here you go right here. -I just... you know, man. -That’s fine. That guy wasn’t really happy with you. I said, her brother wasn’t very happy with you. Yeah, but like I say, I ain’t going nowhere. I’m right here, you know what I’m saying? I stopped and pulled over. So, you know, I didn’t do nothing wrong. You know, I’m standing here dealing with it like a man, you know what I’m saying? Right here. I ain’t running. The female was transported... Her brother left. He hasn’t come back yet. And where was she at? Was she in the crosswalk? -No, she was over here on the street. -She was on the street? Okay. I had already turned past the crosswalk. - Is he coming back? - Yeah, he’s coming back. -Where is he? -He’s over there. ...there’s going to be about 15 people out here. One is going to be a male, black, twenties with a white shirt, blue jeans, and... This is the guy that’s giving us problems that’s walking up right now. Hey, are you with somebody here? Yeah, he’s the one that... yeah, he’s going to give us problems. There’s a large group of them. A lot of them are in white tees. We still need to get a better descrip because there’s a bunch of them out there. Yeah, sorry. 2 TAC 41, can you just have our units step it up to code 3, please? Nine-O-Four. Two-eight-two-four. 24 copy. Code 3. Hey! Your sister’s going to the hospital. Okay? That nigger’s going to the hospital, too. -Hey, back up. -I ain’t did shit. -Back up! -I ain’t did shit. You ain’t sending nobody to the hospital. -I ain’t did shit. -Okay? -What did we say? What did we say? -I ain’t did shit. Okay, you’re not sending nobody to the hospital, okay? -I ain’t did shit. -Okay. I got my hands up. I can’t breathe. Okay, what do you want from us? I don’t want shit from you. Okay, you’re not going to go and attack nobody, okay? -All right. -So, what’s your plan? -Ain’t nothing my plan. -Okay, then walk away. For sure. Two-eight-two-four, to the west of five-three-six-eight Bancroft. I need one more unit en route. Go! Leave! You’re not going to attack nobody. You’re leaving. Okay, we want him to walk away so 938 at that last one. We want him to walk away. Copy? Nine-O-four. This is going to be the brother. A male, black, bald, no shirt, 224, you copy? Two-forty-three E that’s coming in at 3942 36th. Sir. Sir, don’t move. Drop what’s in your hands. Whether it’s hundredths of a second or seconds, the more time I have to assess what this guy popped... what was it he popped around the corner with? I couldn’t tell, sir, honestly. - I thought it was a purse. - You thought it was a purse? -You couldn’t tell? -From the back, sir. Okay, could it have been a gun? Get on the ground! Get on the ground! Could you have warned him? Because we are obligated, if practical and feasible, to give that warning. What could you have said? Sir, get back or I’m going to tase you if you don’t comply with my order. And that’s what you should do, right? Give him every opportunity to go along with the program. Man, if I can end up pointing the taser at somebody and that just mere presence alone gets them to comply, it’s a win-win, right? They don’t get hurt and I don’t have to use force on them. This is getting you used to being under stress, reacting under stress. So, you have to have your game sharp from day one. There is no time out, no cease fire, no re-dos, no remediations, no Mulligans, no nothing. It is what it is. Be prepared for that day. Look at what he did to me! Look what he did to me! My God! Fuck the police! That shit is ruined now. Hey, fuck the police. Can any unit advise that we have a side-show call, 32 yellow 98 and Mac? Several side-show calls at the same intersection, they’re blocking the streets. Six male Hispanics, 18-25, in a vehicle. Two of the subjects holding guns, one on the passenger’s side, one on the driver’s side. I copy. So, 18, I’ll put you on it. Two-seventy-three, do you copy? And breaking news that we are following for you tonight. Police investigating a deadly officer involved shooting. It happened in Oakland and one person has been killed. Oakland Police say that uniformed officers were in the area because they were towing cars related to side-show activity. They killed him just because. He was only walking. The cops killed him for nothing. He was walking over there. - They just shot this nigger. - For nothing, man. What the fuck y'all shoot him for? Killing motherfuckers for no reason! Fuck that! You all killed him! You all killed him! - Bitch ass nigger. - On the sidewalk now! -Sidewalk now! -What? You gonna shoot? -Get on the sidewalk now! -What? You gonna shoot? -Get on the sidewalk now! -What? You gonna shoot? -Faggot! -Get on the sidewalk! What? You gonna shoot? We had a very, very large number of cars at one point totaling close to 700 vehicles that were engaging in side-show activity in East Oakland. At one point, officers stopped a group of motorcycles near 90th and Bancroft. They had cited individuals on the motorcycles and were in the process of towing this group of motorcycles. Well after the stop had occurred and while the officers were completing paperwork, and waiting for tow trucks, an individual, a 39-year-old male, approached the group of police officers and pulled out a pistol from their waistband and pointed it in the general direction of the officers. The group of officers then scattered and four officers discharged their firearms at the person with the pistol. The person was struck by the gunfire and fell there at the scene. Our officers began to do CPR in an attempt to resuscitate the person. Unfortunately, he did die at the scene there. Now, it was only really at that time that officers recognized that the firearm the person had was, in fact, a replica pistol. What could you tell us about the subject of the officer involved shooting? Where was he from? His age? Anything you can tell us and what do you think his involvement was? Our last contact with him was several months ago during an arrest. We do not believe that he was associated with the motorcycles at all, and we do-- We don’t know at this time why he did what he did. And what was the contact several months ago? It was a warrant arrest. All right, um, what else are they going to ask? They’ll probably ask about our total OISs for the year. -So, this is the seventh... -Seventh. -...and fifth fatal. Right. -Right. The fatal ones that we’ve had have been pretty violent confrontations that have turned, so... in the way they’ve brought it to the officer. Did the officers have body cams on and were they deployed? None of the officers had body worn cameras activated at the time. But that would not be unusual because they were basically were filling out paperwork and talking when this happened. They weren’t on a stop. One was a sergeant with seven years’ experience. The other three were police officers with experience ranging from six months to 18 months. So, all relatively new police officers involved in the incident. Twenty-seven, copy. If we take somebody’s life, it’s the most serious thing that a government can do to somebody, and it’s being done without judicial review or any of that. It’s all split second. It happens. We’re going to have to look into the... criminal aspect of whatever the suspect was doing that led to the police contact and was it a crime for the police officer to then use force. Should that force have happened? If you do the right thing here, I will defend you and say you did the right thing every time. If you do the wrong thing, we are going to look at that critically. We have to. This police department has a history that... we have to own up to. It’s our legacy. It would be a tremendous shame to have gone through all the reform tasks over a span of 12 years and then go back to the way we were before. We have to get this right. It’s too important. It’s too important. A press conference just wrapped up a short time ago. Mayor Libby Schaaf was there. Also, the Police Chief Sean Whent was there, and this all is regarding allegations of sexual misconduct by Oakland police officers. Specifically, they’re focusing on allegations of sexual misconduct with a minor. This all started in February of 2015 when she was running from her pimp, she says, and an officer with the Oakland Police Department saved her, in her words. Rather than taking her to jail, they started a romance, she says. And from there, that officer introduced her to other officers and a network of cop customers was made. We will not tolerate criminal misconduct on the part of our police officers. We will hold them accountable. We owe that to the residents of Oakland. We know that this department needs to be the trusted guardians of the community, and we cannot do it with this type of cloud over the department. Some of the officers would pay her for sex and pay her by tipping her off to prostitution stings. Sources say investigators believe she's had sex with potentially dozens of police officers beginning when she was 16. Several officers could be charged with statutory rape. This case has angered a federal judge who is overseeing department reforms. He says this incident and the handling of it is a step back for Chief Whent. As someone who has worked and lived in Oakland since 1969, I am disgusted and amazed by the Oakland Police Department. Officers sworn to protect and serve, raped and trafficked a teenage girl from my community. We are out here saying that OPD is guilty of statutory rape, and the whole department needs to be held accountable, whether you were directly engaged in having sex with a minor, or even if you just knew about it, you need to be held accountable. Good morning. Last night we received the resignation of our police Chief Sean Whent, effective today. When people resign, they give two weeks’ notice, one month’s notice. I mean, people don’t just walk off the job, especially somebody who’s in charge of 700 - 800 people. A department. I mean, this looks like someone got pushed out. The decision to resign was the chief’s. I think it’s very important to be clear that the chief, that Chief Whent has never been a subject of the investigation of sexual misconduct in this department. The chief promised that he would move the department closer actually to complete compliance with the NSA. So the question would be, did he accomplish that? I believe that this chief, Chief Whent, did move the City of Oakland closer to compliance with our negotiated settlement agreement. This department, under his leadership, has received national recognition for its strides to move towards truly principled community based policing. Things like our body worn camera program, our procedural justice training, as well as our participation in transparent open data. The department is now seen as a leader in these areas, and that all occurred under the leadership of Chief Whent, and I’m very appreciative to him for everything he has done for this department. And at this time, I want to introduce Ben Fairow, our interim chief. Good morning. Good morning. It’s an honor and a privilege to be here this morning. Now, while the city conducts a national search for a new chief, the mayor has appointed Ben Fairow, the interim chief. Yes, Natasha, a lot of questions. I’m holding Chief Sean Whent’s resignation letter in my hand. In it, he talks about the progress that was made under his watch, the nearly 40% decline in shootings and homicides in the past three years, and then he goes on to say, "I believe the timing is good for me to move on and to explore other opportunities." I’m on scene, I was close by, I didn't see anything. 904, We’re still interviewing your victim and he was hit over the head. Medical is en route. My life is in danger. Me and my mom’s life is in danger. Well, I have a restraining order on him and he has broken my window. Our caller says the suspect is still on scene. As you all know, a few weeks ago, a young woman, it was revealed that OPD had raped and trafficked a young woman. And we had a really visceral reaction to that, as an organization. We sort of felt like we’ve been saying enough is enough for so long, right? So a coalition came together, which is now being called the Take Back Oakland Coalition. And what’s unique about this coalition is that it’s a wide mix of people, right. It’s grassroots organizations. It’s some legal folks. It’s nonprofits. It’s ministers. It’s just people that are just angry, and sick, and tired. And so, the first demand is to create a civilian police commission. Who is control of use of force policy? Who is in control of use of force review? Who is responsible for disciplining officers and who gets to set the parameters for that discipline? We’re going to push for a police review body that is actually by and for the people and accountable to the people. We do not believe there are good cops. We do not believe that police departments can actually be reformed. We do not believe that policing in this country will ever work for us. And so, one of the things that we talk about is what does 21st century community safety look like, right? And what we talk about is that we’ve got to start having brave and courageous conversations about this system will never work for us, ever, ever, ever. And it don’t work for anybody. It don’t work for poor white people either, right. It’s not working. It’s never going to work. I absolutely have to say this is my first meeting, and I disagree with you guys when you say that there are no good cops. Like I’ll stand up in front of anybody and say that I absolutely disagree with that, because if I’m thinking that there’s no hope, then why in the fuck am I even here? Like I need to... I need to... to think that there is hope and I also know... I also know, I’ll tell everyone of you, that there are some good cops out there, and those are the ones that we need to support. But the question you’ve got to ask yourself when you talk about the good cop or the bad cop, right, is if you are an officer, and you may not be engaging in atrocities against the community like rape, like murder, right, but you are around that, and you know the people that are committing those atrocities, and you’re not saying anything, are you good? That said, right, that said, we have to figure out what we do with right now, right? And right now, we have to figure out how we stem the tide of black and brown bodies that are falling all over this country just a little bit. This is one vehicle... that we have to reign in this violence that we are experiencing at the hands of the police. Because essentially, we could be writing... the policy for a civilian police review body that is going to govern and control... this police department. The idea is not new. The question is whether we have the moment in history right now and the collective will to actually make what’s been a peoples’ demand for 50 years into a lived... reality. You went from assistant chief of the Oakland Police Department. Now you’re acting chief and I don’t even think that’s two hours cold. So, not only are you changing your position, you’re changing your role. You have stopped data roll out and we have all the other things which I’m just about to throw on your plate. The previous chief we had lined up to address, um... a line up with the officers that went out to the shooting, -13th and Franklin, last night. -Okay. -Is there any way that maybe we can-- -What time is that? Well, it was at 2:15 p.m, so we’ve kind of missed our window just because of the transition -and the change. -Right. If we would be able to plug you in because not only are you managing all of these things and these moving parts but because of so many of those officers were young that went to that shooting, we can plug you in just to... -...next step. Yeah. -Sounds good. Good evening. As the mayor of Oakland, I am here to run a police department, not a frat house. Today continues to be a day where we are sharing disturbing information with you. First, we want to announce that we are close to the end of an investigation of racist text messages. We do think it’s relevant to share that the text messages were sent by African American officers, but they are wholly inappropriate and not acceptable from anyone who wears the badge of the Oakland Police Department. Also, today, Acting Chief Figueroa... resigned from his duties as Acting Chief and as Assistant Chief of police. He has gone on leave and has asked to return, as is his right, in the position of Captain. This matter is not related to these texts. It is also not related to the sex scandal. I will not be appointing another Acting Chief. Instead, the command staff of the Oakland Police Department will be reporting to the City Administrator, Sabrina Landreth. I feel that this is an appropriate time to place civilian oversight over this police department, and to send a very clear message about how serious we are of not tolerating misconduct, unethical behavior, and to root out what is clearly a toxic, macho culture. I want to assure the citizens of Oakland that we are hell bent on rooting out this disgusting culture and holding those accountable... ...responsible for their misdeeds. If you’re talking about a systemic culture of kind of toxic, macho behavior, how do you actually try to change a culture? Obviously, there’s good cops and bad cops, but when you’re talking about a systemic culture, that’s a big deal. During your discussions, many discussions, I assume, over the past week with Robert Warshaw, has he provided any indication to you that he may push to have total federal receivership of Oakland Police Department? Mayor Schaaf, what does it say that we are now in the 13th year of federal reform and we’re talking about rooting out a culture of a toxic, macho, disgusting culture that was basically the same culture that led to these federal reforms? This is 13 years later. This is, at the moment, the longest running federal oversight of a police department in the United States. I believe that the problem of a toxic, macho culture is not unique to the Oakland Police Department. It is not unique even to policing. That is all I have tonight. Thank you so much. We’re going to start with a police department seriously in turmoil this morning. We’re talking about the City of Oakland, California. Oakland finds itself in this situation after losing three chiefs in nine days. Mayor Schaaf also said that she has no plans right now to appoint another interim chief. Well, this department is starting to feel, to a lot of people, like a house of cards. How can we stay in our houses? How can we stay silent? They were not honest about the values they say they represent. They covered up corruption. So, we say to Oakland Police Department, "You are guilty and we will no longer participate with your conspiracy. We are going to pull this system down through the power of nonviolent direct action." Shut it down. Shut it down. "And if you refuse to do what is right, we will pull down your department brick by brick." And so, the ability to effectively make sure that we have accountability for those officers who are not serving our public well, we need to establish a system outside of the police department to do that. We want you to help us to fix this community, to fix the system. Protect and serve us from the inside by calling out corruption, by calling out racism, by calling out crime on the inside. We cannot see everything that goes on behind those doors, but you can. Where is the trust? There is no relationship without trust. Now, since you have failed after 13 years, we are saying we’re willing to do it. We’ve got to go outside the police department to get a chief. True independence must be in place. That badge is important, right? That badge is really important. You earned it. You deserve to wear it. You did your 26 weeks. You’re going to graduate on Friday and you’re going to earn your badge. Stand up for me. You came here with something. You came here with something. You’re going to leave with something. And what is that? What did you come with? What’s on this uniform that you came with that’s yours? We didn’t give it to you. This is who you are. This is who you are. How are people going to remember that? What is your legacy going to be? You’re going to start Friday building a legacy of who you are. Who are you going to be? Are you going to be the cop that people talk about, the dirty cop that does things that he shouldn’t do? Are you going to be the one that’s unprofessional that people talk about, "Man, I can’t stand when he comes. I can’t stand when she comes, they’re assholes?" Who are you going to be? You’ve heard the stories before. You’ve heard of dirty cops before. You’ve heard of nasty cops that are assholes, haven’t you? You’ve heard of them. But who are you going to be? What’s your legacy going to be? What you’re doing is a noble cause. It’s a noble profession. You’re doing a great thing. You can’t put your life on the line every day. You come here every day not knowing if you’re going to make it home or not. You can’t put your life on the line every day and it not mean anything. What’s your legacy going to be? How are you going to represent your family? How are you going to represent yourself? And then, how are you going to represent the police department? That’s what you have to ask yourself.
