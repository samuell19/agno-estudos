All right, already. I'm doing it. So much for spring break. Keep it down. I'm not in the mood. I'm sorry, boy, but Mom has a feed delivery coming tomorrow. Hamlet, you're going to get me in a lot of trouble. Alex? Shh. Shh. Quiet. Quiet. Alex? What did I say? It was just... He looked so hungry. He's a pig, Alex. And one of us has to be firm with him, and it's not gonna be me. You are filthy, girl. Still Daddy's little lady. Make sure you put his boots back by my bed, okay? They smell pretty bad. That's the best smell ever. You are so weird, Mom. You know, Dad always said the land will provide. Yeah. But Dad probably would've wanted to eat Hamlet. He would not eat your show pig, hon. You finish up your chores and actually take a shower today. Yes, ma'am. And don't tell Princess, but I'll bring home cheeseburgers for dinner. What is it, girl? You forget your helmet, Alex? I didn't forget it. How is the egg business? Slow. Hey, Ethan. What are you doing? Killing zombies. You know, we are trying to help your mom, right? Our farm is not for sale. Your daddy was a war hero, Alex. People around here take that stuff seriously. Mike, meet me at Open Ridge right by Highway 54. Roger that. Gotta roll. Tell your mom hey. Put on a helmet, will you? Have a seat. Now this goes against my better judgment, Sergeant. I'm told that dog may not be safe for anyone anymore. Sir, I promised Clay... Clay Sanders was a one-of-a-kind soldier. But, this is not protocol for our military dogs. Dakota is hardly a pet. Promise is a promise. I just hope that you are up to date on your shots. You're being reassigned to Camp Lejeune. You have seven days of R&R once you step foot back on American soil. Next time I see you will be on North Carolina time. Dismissed. Thank you. It took me two days to catch her last time. Hey there, Dakota. Open the gate. Yes, sir. I guess I owe you a lot, huh, girl? Heel. How you doing, kiddo? You, uh, you hungry? I work on a farm that's going out of business, Grandpa. Yes, I'm hungry. I bet you're just saying that so you can sneak a candy bar back to Hamlet. Maybe. Farms cost a lot of dough, kiddo. The last two harvests, slim pickings, hurt a lot of farmers around here. That's why I came here to talk business with you, Grandpa. Business, huh? Sounds serious. Tell me, how has your, uh, how is your mama doing? How come you two don't talk much? You know, I just decided to give her a little space with everything you guys have been going through. So, what'd you have in mind? Lemonade stand? Car wash? Selling cookies? You're gonna need a calculator. Pen and pencil will do just fine. I have to help my mom save our farm. Well, then, looks like we're gonna need a calculator after all. With a lot of zeros. Step into my office. So much for catching the bad guys. What in the world is that? Bad guys can hear you coming a mile away. Survival of the fittest, little brother. Gotta be fast, strong and loud. Or become extinct. What's he doing in the car? Spring break week. Bring your kid to work day. Bring your kid to work day? What is the world coming to? You're gonna make that boy soft, Mike. Softness gets you nowhere. 'Cause you did such a good job with your kids. Hey. My ex sabotaged me with my own kids. And that was a long time ago. Well, I'm sorry, Jack. I didn't mean nothing by it. Now, look, I know I can be a little, uh, rough around the edges but my intentions are good. Took care of you and Mama when Daddy... He was a good man. Worked too hard. Gone too soon. But that ain't gonna happen to us, little brother. You know why? Why, Jack? Because of that land right out there. That, Mike, is our future. Yours, mine, Ethan's. That land belongs to Kate Sanders now. She can't afford to keep the farm. Renting the land out for others to grow crops ain't gonna cut it. Why do you want their land, Jack? They don't want to sell. You can't take it. I ain't gonna take it. I ain't gonna steal it. I'm gonna buy it. I just want to help her and her little girl get on with their lives. Just don't do something stupid we can't fix. They're nice people. So are we, little brother. So are we. Well, it's a good thing there hasn't been a fire this year. You gonna be able to fix it? I'll make her run. Can't promise for how long. It is what it is. Town doesn't have a budget for a new one for five years. For the life of me, I don't understand why you took this job, Kate. Well, someone has to help out. Mm, I reckon. And here we are wondering why we don't have money for a new fire truck? Oo-wee! Ain't she a beauty? She gonna be ready for the May Day parade? If we tow it, yes. Hmm. Maybe what we need to do is find ourselves a new mechanic. Kate, mind if we speak? Sure. Did you, uh, take a look at the offer? I have. I appreciate it. But, uh, we ain't selling. Oh, dear, I mean, you realize you're not gonna see money like that. Not for that piece of land. Definitely. And really, I'm doing it out of respect for Clay. Word is you're thinking of taking Clay's life insurance and putting it away for Alex's college. So, Kate, Kate, you take my deal, you're not gonna have to worry about money. All you gotta do is sign it. I'm gonna take care of the rest. I think you gotta let it go, Sheriff. I better let it go? Yeah. Let it go. Yeah. That was my family land for generations. Before your father-in-law stole it. From my daddy. My father-in-law, he paid a fair price. Mm, Kate. No. You're at the bottom of the hill looking up. Well, I think we'll manage. I just hate to see you lose it all. So, tell you what I'm gonna do. Give you some more time to think about it. Okay then. Okay. Good day, Kate. Have a good day, Sheriff. How bad is it? I ain't gonna sugarcoat it. It ain't good. I tried to tell your mom and dad when I gave them the farm for a wedding present, but, you know... ...your mama don't want to hear it from me. It's a beautiful place, Grandpa. We can't lose it. It's where Daddy's buried. I didn't agree with that either. Should've had a proper military burial. Arlington maybe. You two could have come lived with me. We need you, Grandpa. It's me asking because Mom won't. Hello, Officer. Was I speeding? Well, I certainly hope not because, uh, that was painfully slow. But you got some out of state tags, so I'll need to see some ID? You just passing through? You could say that. I'm visiting. Oh. Who might that be? I'm sorry, but does it matter? It matters if I say it does. You got a license for that dog? Ooh, where'd you serve? Afghanistan. You a friend of Clay Sanders? I am. That is tragic what happened to him. A ticket for out of state tags? Dakota, heel. I'm sorry about that. She's normally a great judge of character. Well, you should be careful because, uh, this ain't a dog friendly town. Come on. Good girl. Good girl. Stay. I'm just gonna save you the time. - I'm CJ. I, uh... - We're not interested in selling. Kate? Knowing my name ain't gonna help. You're one of them vultures. Vultures. Sir, please get off our land. Now. I served with Clay. I came to bring you his things, ma'am. I promised that I would bring her home to you. Heel! This is Dakota. Clay's best friend. It's Dakota? Hi, girl. I, I thought they weren't allowed to come home. Yeah, well, she is retired now. It was a special request. Last thing we need is a dog, sir. Dakota. Shoot. Uh... Sorry. Hey! I think I know where she's going. This was Clay's favorite place as a child. That's why I chose to bury him here. Dakota hasn't been the same since. She runs off every chance she gets trying to find him. - She can't stay. - Alex, don't be rude. I don't need a dog. I need my dad! Things have been hard on her the past few months. You know, I shouldn't have just dropped in on you like this. It's okay. I, I just wasn't expecting... A stranger? And a dog? She looks different than the pictures. She's thinner. Yeah. She'll come around. You know, if there's anything that I can do, I'm happy to help. Any chance you know how to fix a leaky sink? Uh. Okay. Hi. Personal space. Don't get too used to this. How's it coming along? Can you turn on the faucet, please? All right. Loose pipe. Looks like we did it. I'm not sure "we" was much help. Well, somebody had to turn the water on. That counts as a team effort. All right. Well, uh, I should be, uh, heading back. Tonight? I mean, it's a long ride to North Carolina. I saw a motel up the road. I got a few days R&R. Thought I'd take my time driving back. Maybe stop in Knoxville. I got some friends there. We got an extra room. And a friend of Clay's is always welcome here. Dakota will be happy. She really loved Clay. Hard not to. Just such a good man. Yeah. Uh, when I was driving in, I saw you got a big hole in your corral. It's just so hard to keep up with everything. I mean, I try, but without Clay... I'm not saying that my carpentry skills are as good as my plumbing. Is that so? They're not bad for, you know, a city boy from Chicago. At least we got the best pizza in the world. Well, I guess you never had homemade Georgia pizza. Did you say pizza or peaches? Okay, very funny, Mister Big City Boy. You see about the fence, and I'll see about lunch tomorrow. Okay. Deal. Deal, soldier. Princess, meet Dakota. Princess is my favorite. Hamlet, meet Dakota. That went well. Not. Dakota, meet the Dirty Dozen. That's Captain Cluck. All the hens think he's cute. Mom says it has something to do with his red mohawk. What's wrong? Jeez. Don't just stand there. It's creepy. Come on. I can teach her a few commands. I mean, Dakota will respond quickly, I think. I'd appreciate that. Why is she anxious sometimes? PTSD. You know, we have parents, brothers, sisters, friends. All she ever had was Clay. He never let Dakota down. They always had each other's backs. I'm good. Help me get these people home, Dakota. You hear me? We got a bomb, soldiers. Heel. Come on. Heel. Honey, what's wrong? She won't listen to me. You gotta try harder. It's what she is trained to do. You gotta stay calm. We can't afford her. We'll find a way. She's part of our family. I can pay for the food. It's no worries. She's just gonna run off anyways. Alex, please. We're not Dad. How do we know she just won't leave us? I know this is hard. But we're all she has now. - Make some room in your heart for her. - But... And don't say you can't. I know that you can. You know the most amazing thing about hearts is they can let in so much. Even when they're hurt. I know you can do this. Wanna try again? Like Daddy would want? Dakota. Dakota, heel. Heel. Heel. Heel. Good girl. Good girl. Dakota, heel. Come on. Let's go. So this is Dakota. Heard a lot about you, girl. Dad's friend CJ brought her home to us. She's such a good girl. Her and Dad were partners 100%. She seems to really like you. Well, marine... nice to finally meet you. You're a good girl. I heard so much about you, baby. Huh? Hmm? How you doin'? How you doin'? - Hey, Alex. - Oh, hey. Who's your friend? This is Dakota. She was my Dad's. Oh, she's really special. So was your dad, but... Oh. All right, you just ate it. You can take it. Uh, you know, Ethan, you and Alex should become friends. I am playing with my friends right now. Online. You don't game? Oh. No. My Mom says I can get a phone for my birthday, tho. - You don't have a... - Ethan. But you don't even know these guys. Bet you Alex has a bunch of real life friends. Yeah, like Princess. Hamlet. Captain Cluck. Awesome nicknames. I think. And Dakota. Hey there. Smart, too. Dakota, heel. Good girl. See you later. Bye, Alex. So, Dakota, I'm gonna show you where Daddy used to work. Stairs are probably safer. No way. You like to dig more than any dog I know. What is he doing here? Well, looks like you found yourself a job. Anything I can do to help out. Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure that you are more than willing to help out. Wow. Is there something I can do for you, Sheriff? I'll let you know. You know, I hit a hole in one here back in '92. I know, Grandpa. I know. Only problem was God was my only witness. Now I got you. Behold, Alex. Behold. Ugh! You, young lady, did not just see that. You've gotta be kidding me. I love it, girl. Come on, girl! Would you get a load of this. Look at that. That was beautiful, girl. Nice job! Beautiful. Look at that. You know, it's been a, been a long time since... ...we had a nice family dog. Yep. What you got there? Found it on the farm. Dakota dug it up. Kinda' pretty if you polish it up a bit. Now you got a new dog and a pet rock. This is what they call a mulligan, Alex. A mulligan? That's right. A do-over. Grip it and rip it, baby. Oh! Oh! Smokey in the trees? I got this. I got this. Please start. Please start. Yes! Fire! Come on, Dakota. Fire, huh? You just leave Dakota back here with me. Fire? Come on, Dakota, let's go! Fire! Alice, where's the fire? - Smokey. - Mom! They say where there's smoke there's fire, but I don't see nothing. That's Smokey? I didn't know what else to do. He's all I have. Smokey in the trees. Okay. - Let's save Smokey. - Hurry up! He has never even climbed a tree before. Smokey's a feline. It's in their DNA. Like a soldier who was born to protect your freedom. Cats, they, uh, they climb trees. Yeah. Looks like we got a hook and ladder without the ladder. Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate, Kate. Oh! Dakota. Oh! Are you sure the cat's okay? Oh, you little rascal. - Okay. - Beautiful! - Girl, come here! - Good girl! Good girl! Oh, you are a hero. Good job! Oh, my little baby. Look who came. I was so worried. Nice job, kiddo. Thanks. Listen, I know I haven't been around for a while. You and me, we... We haven't had a chance to talk. Yeah. Yeah, me, me, too. I just, I been pretty busy lately. Alex told me. I didn't realize how, uh, things got so tough. Listen, Kate. I want to say I'm sorry for the way I handled Clay's funeral, okay? That was your decision. I should've stayed out of it. Thanks, Dad. You know, when you and Clay got married, I loved when you started calling me Dad. Missed that. I just want what's best for you and Alex. Who's such a good girl? I'm so proud of you. She's just like him. She sure is. You're a hero! Target. Left flank. Get down. Hold your fire. Okay, soldiers. Stand down. Almost back to home base. Just six months from now we'll be home. What the... Somebody here? Oh, no. Doggie? Stay, dog. Don't you bite me! So, uh, - nothing's missing. - No. But why break in? It just... It doesn't make any sense. What is it, girl? Mom, they've been cut. But whoever lives in the truth will come into the light, so that it can be seen clearly that what he has done has been done through God. Psst. Hey, dog. Look what I got for you. Oh, I've got some nice, refreshing gelato. That's it. Come on. Come on, Dakota. Come on. That's it. Wow. Who doesn't love some gelato on a hot day like this? That's right. Everybody loves gelato. As so profoundly written in the scriptures, John 8:32. "Ye shall see the truth. And the truth will make you free." Mm... Ain't nothing more refreshing on a hot day than gelato. That's right, puppy. Come on. Come on. Got plenty more where that came from. Hey, dog. Looking for this? We've got a big surprise for you. Ha, this gonna be fun, boss. Come on. There's only room for one alpha dog in this town. And that's me. My car! She's scratching my beautiful car! What are you doing, man? Come on, get down here! Get! You have got to be kidding me? I'm sorry, boss. I am gonna get you, dog. Thank you so much, everybody, for coming. Go in peace. Keep the faith. She's such a good girl. I know. Dakota. Is this how you spend all your Sunday nights? Pretty much. There's always something needs doing around here. Right in there. Thank you. Did Clay ever tell you he was Camden's fire chief? No. He didn't. I kind of inherited the position. He loved this place. - Hey, you okay? - Kate, there's something I gotta tell you, and it can't wait any longer. It's about Dakota. You're making me nervous. The reason that I'm here, the reason I'm alive is because of her. And Clay. What do you mean? She... I'm, I'm sorry. That's an emergency call. I, I gotta take it. I'm sorry. Fire station. What's your emergency please? June Dwyre's place? I know. Route 54. I'm, I'm on my way okay? It's gonna be okay. Hey, something wrong? There's a real fire. Alex, you and Dakota, you get inside now. Come on. This is a volunteer fire department, okay? And, and I volunteer you. What's happening, Mom? Is there a fire? It's okay, honey. You just stay here. We'll be right back, okay? Come on. - I need you. - Stay. Come on, Dakota. They might need your help. Come on, Dakota. Help! My mama's in there! I don't see any cats. This is the real deal. Okay. Let's move! Grab the hoses. Just like we trained, okay? Okay, I got it! Alex! Stay back! Kate! Kate, do not go in there! Kate! Mom! No! No! No, no! No, Dakota. This is what she does. To the moon and back, Clay. To the moon and back. Kate! Kate! Mom! - Mama! - Mom! Dakota! Mama. Mom, you and Dakota were amazing. - Don't do that again. - No. Bravo. Bravo. So our volunteer fire department can actually put out a fire. Y'all are heroes. I didn't know you were sticking around here, soldier boy. Turned you into a fireman, huh? What's next? Doctor? A lawyer? Mom, I haven't seen Dakota. Missing your dog there, missy? Suspect has been apprehended. Copy that. This could've been a lot worse. Y'all should be proud. What are we gonna do? Here. She'll be back, hon. CJ said she does that sometimes. She's a trained soldier, so exploring is part of her job. She doesn't like to be alone. Grandpa is gonna help me put fliers up in the morning. Good. Then you better get to bed. You make sure to say a prayer for Dakota. Okay? I love you. I love you. Good night. Good night, baby. Please, God, bring Dakota home. Thanks. Alex okay? Yeah. I told her you said Dakota would be okay. I meant to tell you, you did real good tonight. Just doin' my part, I guess. Is something on your mind? Danforth. I don't trust him. Never have. You be careful, he's bad news. You know, we had plans to fix up this place, turn it into a working farm. Funny how life can change so fast. Yes, it can. It does. I just got the call. I'm due back at the base day after tomorrow. I didn't realize it would be so soon. We're all gonna miss you around here. Me, too. Kate. About Clay, what I meant to tell you earlier... They attacked us early in the morning. We need to flank them from the other side. Most of us were wounded, including Clay. We couldn't see anything. We were fighting off insurgents. They had us pinned by RPG... You don't need to tell me this. I know what happened. I saw your scars. Kate. Nobody really knows. I was scared. I couldn't move. Clay, he knew it. Dakota, she was protecting Clay. She would not leave his side. But Clay, he ordered her to save me. And Dakota, she followed that order. Dakota, get CJ. That's my girl. So Clay should be here. It's not your fault. It is all that I think about. And you and Alex, you need Clay here now more than ever. And I'm sorry. You're here. Clay made sure of it. And that means you're right where you belong. Hey. Got a lost dog. Name's Dakota. Here, it's for my dog. Okay. Yeah. You don't need to hang those up anymore. Follow me. Why would Dakota be in a jail for humans? I had to go to my uncle's last night to drop off his uniform. He uses our washer and dryer, the weirdo. Anyway, I heard him on the phone. They're gonna transfer Dakota to the pound. We don't have much time. Go in the side door. - Which key? - It shall reveal itself. - Reveal itself? - Trust me. Oh. Why are you helping me? I like dogs. And you're okay, too. All right. It shall reveal itself. Try the one that says "Side Door". Why didn't you tell me you marked the keys? Where's the adventure in that? Whoo. Let's get down to the diner, man. I'm starving. Let's grab some lunch. Hey. There you are. This is where Sheriff Danforth hides his secret stash. Don't say a word to anybody about this. Don't worry, man. Not a word. So that explains where all the toilet paper goes. Uh-oh. What? What is it? Sheriff just pulled up. Just get Dakota. Oh, no. We got more company. Dakota! There you are, girl. Hey. What is it now, Mike? I hope you aren't doing something stupid. Like what? You know anything about this? Hey, boss. She's inside. Way to go, knuckleheads. Who's inside? Uh-oh. Alex? You might want to pick it up a bit. What is going on here? Enough of the games, Jack. What is this all about? What in the Sam heck is going on here? Dog? You sleeping, dog? Dog? No! Go, go. Go. Come on, girl. Michael, that dog has escaped. - Dog? W... what dog? - Move. I'm trying. You move. I said, move! Michael. Stupid. We did it! Thanks, Ethan, that was awesome. You two should keep moving. Oh, uh, one more thing, Alex. I noticed something else strange at my Uncle Jack's house last night. He has some kind of geology chart and map of the town. He had the Sanders' Farm circled on it. Thanks, Ethan. I, I know you didn't have to tell me that. Now get out of here and be careful. Okay. Coming through. Let's go, Dakota. I've made you some coffee. Thanks. You sure you have to leave now? Told you she'd be back. - Where did you find her? - Hi, girl. Long story. CJ, where you going? I gotta go, little lady. I gotta get back to work. Well, you can work here. Uh, it doesn't work that way. But we'll see you again, won't we? No goodbyes. No goodbyes. Take care of Dakota. Of course. What is the emergency? Take it easy, bud. Well, you radioed in it was urgent. What? You lose another puppy? This is serious little brother. It's time I leveled with you. Let you in on a little secret about this land here. Oh, we have been over this before. Kate ain't selling. The bank forecloses on Friday. What? How do you know that? I know everything that goes on in my town. Why have you had it in for them all these years? Well, there's history here, little brother. - Take a look at that. - Oh. Great. Nice rock. Those are diamonds. - Diamonds? - Hmm. Where did you find this? The story goes, a miner found diamonds near here in the 1800s in Hall County. Pop found that piece just before Monty Sanders took over the deed. Well, I did not know that. Well, you were young. But I swore to him before he passed that I would get the land back in the Danforth name. This has been your plan the whole time? Whatever's out there, diamonds or not, legally belongs to Kate and Alex. Oh, come on, Mike. I don't like what happened to Clay any more than you do. There's times in your life that you gotta step up, man. This time... Oh, look who's here. Look who's here. You know, that CJ fellow left this morning. Now it's time for this dog to go. We don't need anything else getting dug up around here. Are you sure this isn't more about revenge than diamonds, Sheriff? I'm warning you. If you're not gonna help me, stay out of my way. You understand me, little brother? Stay out of my way. I remember now. Al-x marks the spot. We ain't selling! If you get foreclosed on, you are gonna be holding a big bag of nothing! Okay, I just need another week. I, I, I'll find the money! Put that dog on a leash or else! Don't you talk to my daughter like that. Oh, come on, Kate. Take the deal while you are getting a more than fair price. - Take it! - Why do you want our land so bad, Sheriff? Does it have something to do with this? What's on this land? Unless you have a warrant, you are trespassing on our property. You don't want my help. Fine. Let the bank have it! That's it. It's okay, Mom. I can't do this anymore. No, he's just trying to scare you. I think we have to sell. No, no, no. If Daddy were here... But he's not. He's not. I'm sorry. - Use Daddy's life insurance to pay for the farm. - No. Daddy wanted you to follow your dreams. This farm is my dream! Alex. Come on. Come on. At the tone, please record your message. Um, hi, CJ. It's me, Alex. If you can, we really need you to come back. Like, now. Come on, girl. Alex? Alex? Alex! Where are you? Hello? Hello? What? Missing? I'm gonna handle this once and for all. What'd you do with her? Well, hey there, Monty. Lose one of your balls again? Where's Alex? I don't have any idea what you're talking about. Hey! Have you gone crazy? I'm on to you, Danforth. You're trying to steal my son's land. Steal? No. Buy? You betcha. I'm gonna buy your son's land, Monty Sanders. There ain't nothin' you're gonna do about it. Next one ain't gonna miss. Hey! Where's my granddaughter? I don't know where your little troublemaker is, but I will tell you this. I do not appreciate being accused by the man that double crossed my daddy. Your old man lost that farm to the bank, and I bought it fair and square. Go along before I lose my cool. Why don't you go tee off, on the highway? You're gonna get your dirty hands on that farm over my dead body! Oh, God. Shoot. This is Sheriff Danforth. I need an ambulance up at the station ASAP. We'll establish perimeter within five miles of the Sanders' place. I'll put a call into county. Ask for more backup. - Any news? - Not yet. But I got every unit on it. Any idea where she might be? Where she'd run off to? She has never gone out at night like that before. You don't think someone took her, do you? No. No. Don't worry. We'll find her. Hello? Okay. I'll be right there. I gotta go. Something's wrong with Monty. No. Kate. I want you to know, I'm sorry. About everything. What do you think, doc? He's, he's gonna be okay, right? He didn't wanna go to the hospital. Don't worry, Kate. I've called Atlanta General. Set him up an EKG for tomorrow. I ain't going nowhere. It's just to be safe, Monty. Crack of dawn, I'll be on the tee box tomorrow. You know I hit a hole in one on the 7th back in '92. We know, Dad. We know. Alex, where is she? They haven't found her yet. We will. Hey, y'all. I'm sorry, the, uh, front door was unlocked. You know, you gotta watch that. Doc. What in the hell are you doing here, Danforth? Just came by to let y'all know that I have a full tilt search going on. I give you my word, we're gonna find your... your sweet, s... sweet little, uh... Alex, you idiot. How is Jack Nicklaus doing? You got some nerve showing up in this house. Easy there, Tiger... Woods. I could arrest you right now for assault. With a deadly weapon. You're lucky I didn't finish the job. Well. Now look, I just think this whole thing has gotten out of hand. And I think that all of us need to find a way to be civil with one another. That's why I've decided to up my offer. Five percent. She ain't signing nothing, Danforth. Kate? I am trying to get you out of a pinch here. Now, I don't need to remind you all what's gonna happen on Friday with the bank. Don't do it, Kate. Signature page is right there. You're running out of runway, darling. Don't do it. I'm gonna need a pen. A pen. Don't do it, Kate. Pen? What you doing here, soldier boy? Shouldn't you be out protecting the country somewhere? That somewhere is here. Don't sign anything. Listen to him, Kate. We're gonna do everything in our power to save that farm. This is your last chance. Go home, Sheriff. Show some respect. Have it your way. Get out of here. I'll tell you this. That farm is mine. Oh. You. Alex is missing. Dakota? Gone, too. Well, good. If Dakota is with Alex, then she is safe. You got that right. She's with a Marine. Oorah. Oorah. I can't believe you're here. Let, let's go look for her. Dad, we'll be back, okay? Come on. Come on. Where is it? Dad always said, "Alex will mark the spot." Come on, Dakota! Dang chickens. No one's seen her. Any place we haven't covered yet? The only place I can think of is the farm. What now? Fire Chief. Wait. Are you sure? Okay. Get us to the fire station. What's wrong? It's the farm. Should have listened to me, Kate. You should've listened to me. What you got, girl? Another one. That's it. You found it! Good girl. Good girl. Must be another treasure map. "Alex, if you found this box, that means you were searching for something special." "I did this to remind you that your treasure is always here inside of you. My angel, you are mine and your mom's greatest treasure." "We love you forever and ever. And to the moon and back and back. Love you always. Dad." You won't listen to me. You know, it doesn't really matter where we are. - Alex! Run! Your farm's on fire! - What? Hey! Kate! Hey, what do you want, man? Get out of here! I want to help. I trust him. Faster. We're taking the shortcut. Dakota, wait for me! Stop! Meet you at your house! Hey, little girl. There's some bad guys out here. I think they're trying to burn down your farm. Why don't you go on home? And, uh, they went this way. So, I'm gonna go get 'em. Go get him, Dakota! Get him! Help! Help! - Who called it in? - The neighbors. Hey! Dad! It's Uncle Jack! Hey! Somebody get this fleabag off of me! Cursed dog! Go on! Arrest this animal! It's a dangerous animal! Oh, I'm gonna sue you. And I am gonna take this farm. You'll never take this farm. What is that? That's a good question, soldier boy. There is a fire starter in town. Set the can down, Jack. What'd you say to me? Say that again. Dakota? There's gas everywhere! No! Dakota! Alex. Dakota. Good girl. Hey. Hey. Hey. - Come on. - Come here. Come here. - All right. - Oh. Hey, old friend. You got the right to remain silent. You got the right to shut up, Mike. Just wait till we get home. We ain't going home. CJ, you made it. You're not gonna be in trouble with the Marines, are you? No, the sergeant approved this as a top-secret mission. Operation LNDB. LNDB? Leave No Dog Behind. Last chance, Mike. Sure you want to throw it all away? Wow. I'm so proud of you. You're a hero! Dakota dug a bunch of these up. What you and Alex got is a diamond farm. What? Dad always said... "The land will provide!" Good girl. Good girl.
