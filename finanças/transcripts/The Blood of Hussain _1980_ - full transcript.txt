What is your name, my son? Hussain. The sworf of Yazid has scarred your face. From where have you come? From the cradle of the past. From the tomb of the future. From the circle of the present We are prisoners of our destiny. Our journeys curve to their beginnings. Your namesake, Imam Hussain, defied the usurper Caliph and stamped the plain of Karbala with his own blood. We must mourn the blood that quenched the parched sands. We must mourn until the Last Day forever tears away the web of time. Get out of the way! Hey Monkey, you're okay now. You've made it to the top. You're the President. You control television, radio and the press. You oppress the people. Any comment, Mr President? He says democracy is dead. And you're in real trouble. Get them out. - What's wrong? - The mare's giving birth early, Welcome, Selim Sahab. How are you? Well, thank you. Is Hussain here? He's in the stables. Selim Sahab is here. Welcome, brother. Akbar, show Selim Sahab my new horse. Yes, Sir. Akbar, what's wrong with Hussain? Why is he quarrelling with the authorities? What can I say? He's a headstrong young man. He won't listen to anyone, but, God willing, he'll settle down. Go ahead, I'll get the horse. At Karbala, Imam Hussain declared: "In this place I will be buried "until the Day of Judgement. "Here I will receive thirteen wounds. "My sisters will witness my death from their tents. On the seventh day, Yazid's army barred access to the river. On the eve of the tenth day, Hussain addressed his followers: "O companions, my faith is in you. “Now that night has fallen, extinguish the lanterns in the camp, "take my family and escape under the cover of darkness. "The dispute with Yazid is my concern. "I alone shall die for the faith.” They replied, "Here we will be killed but once. "But even if we were to suffer many deaths, "and our ashes were scattered to the winds, "never would we leave your side.” The tenth day dawned. Hussain's followers were massacred. Hussain rode his white horse onto the plain of Karbala. He said, "O believers in my grandfather, why spill my blood?" They replied, "Swear allegiance to Yazid "and your life will be spared.” Hussain replied, "I am the Prophet's grandson. "I can give up my life and the lives of my children. "I can sacrifice the sanctity of my sisters. "But I will never accept the supremacy of Yazid. Hussain drew his sword and spurred on his white horse. Yazid's soldiers attacked him and inflicted thirteen wounds. Hussain was martyred in Karbala. There is no parallel in history. Every age breeds a Yazid, but Imam Hussain remains unique. By his death Islam is reborn ... In this locket are sacred verses to guide you on your life's journey. Go in peace, my son. You have travelled far, Hussain. But you are still a stranger to yourself, Can a man be a stranger to himself? Misfortune in love is not life's only sorrow. Not only in you does my happiness reside. Ask not of me, my love, the passion we once shared. You are not destined to understand. Hussain, one day from your body there will open many wounds, from whence will spring your force to feed a multitude. You have the blessing of God, Hussain. With the help of the Unseen, you will be called upon to dispense justice. I have nothing else to give you but this prophecy. Misfortune in love is not life's only sorrow. Not only in you does my happiness reside. Ask not of me, my love, the passion we once shared. Come. Let us pray together. Akbar, my horse knocked over a girl. I don't know if she was hurt. She ran away. Go and see if she's all right. How do I find her? At least can you describe her to me? She is beautiful, with long black hair. You describe her beauty. That won't help me find her. She was wearing a black skirt, and around her neck she wore a big locket set with jewels, This is her shawl. Hussain Sahab, she is my daughter. Please sit down. Smoke, sir. Who do you want to see? Selim Murtaza. What do you want with him? It's personal. He's my brother, You're Selim Sahab's brother? Your name? Hussain. Selim Sahab's brother is here. You can go in. Hussain Sahab, is all well? You should have sent for me. Please sit down. I will be with you in a moment. - What brings you here? - Please sit. I have come myself to discuss an important matter. You're welcome. What is it? Akbar, I've come to ask for your daughter's hand. My daughter's hand? On whose behalf? I wish to marry her. Hussain Sahab, what are you saying? How can this be? What will your family say? I don't care what they say. Please rest assured that I will honour and cherish her. Some villagers wish to see you, sir. Send them in. Please come in. Come and sit down. Sit down. Will you eat with me? Bring food for them. Is all well? Hussain Sahab ... ...we have many problems. We try o live in peace. But it seems we are not destined to. Our lives are devoid of happiness. Speak plainly. They have seized more of our lands. - When? - This morning. We have struggled to remain on our lands, but they refuse to let us, They outnumber us. They are very powerful. Don't worry. All right. Whoever has suffered a loss, I will compensate with a piece of my land. Thank you, sir. Are you in pain? Now my time has come, my son. But do not be alarmed. I am at peace with the world... ...and I await my end. You are troubled, my son? Many years have passed since you prophesied. I am married now and my wife is with child. Much has happened in the world since you withdrew from it. Yet nothing has changed. Mankind still suffers injustice at the hands of powerful men. I know I am destined. . ... to die for humanity. But I am confused. I have received no sign. You will receive no sign. You are yourself the sign. Now leave me to sleep. I am nearing that ocean... . that awaits us all. I must prepare myself There is but one God... and Muhammad is His Prophet Hussain Sahab, the soldiers have killed many of our men There's a price on your head. We must leave the village at once. Get everyone ready. Praise God, you have a son, - How is the mother? - The mother is well. But there is no water, not even to cleanse the child. Don't worry, we are near a river. We will find water. Find a way out There is no way out We will camp here. - All right, - Go on - Tell the men ... - Yes, sir. Come closer. Tell the men to extinguish the lanterns in the camp. Yes, Sir. Whoever wishes to leave under cover of darkness, I will not begrudge them. Yes, Sir. All right, sir. All right, sir. Hussain Sahab has malaria. He has asked me to extinguish the lanterns.
