My name's Kimball Smythe. But you don't need to know about me yet. In fact, I wasn't even there that hot afternoon 30 years ago in a Texas town on the backside of nowhere. Still, I came to know a few pertinent bits and pieces about the beginning, and about this woman who would dominate and change so many lives. Her name was Callie Lord, then, and she was young and somebody, as they used to say, had done her wrong, quite wrong. Funny thing is, in the best tradition of melodramatic literature, the tale would one day end right here, where it all started. Oh... Oh. Oh, my baby. Oh, my... It's gonna be just fine. Callie never even got to hold her baby. It was a boy. The day after he was born, a lawyer out of Amarillo drove into town to collect the merchandise. Now, listen carefully, Miss Lord. This first paper's called the Act of Relinquishment. "I, Callie Martha Lord, "do hereby relinquish and surrender said below described "white male, Caucasian infant for permanent adoption." I've been thinking about this, Mr. Lawrence. Been thinking a whole lot, and have changed my mind. I'm afraid that's quite impossible, Miss Lord. My clients have already paid out $245 on prenatal care. You back out now, Callie, and they're gonna have to file on you for fraud. Criminal fraud. That's felony. I don't wanna cause anybody any trouble. It's just that baby is my flesh, he's my son. I'll pay you back all the money. It's too late now. You're a Christian girl, aren't you, Callie? Hmm. Never been in trouble before? Well, then, you'd probably get a 10-year suspended sentence. Likely as not, they'll put that baby in an orphan home. If I sign it, could I just hold my baby for one minute? That wouldn't be right. It'll just be too hard after that. What, are they good people? Fine Christian family. Nurse. Please witness that I am formally handing to Callie Martha Lord the cashier's check from the Republic Northstar National Bank, Dallas, Texas, in a sum of $2,000 for services rendered. Callie never told anybody the name of her baby's father. She buried the past the day she left Chillicothe. With an ache in her heart and $2,000 in her pocket, she bought a bus ticket to Dallas. The last thing she did was call her mama, whose blessing was goodbye and good riddance. It's a buck fifty a week. Payable every Friday afternoon at 5:30 p.m., sharp. One minute late, and I call the sheriff. You'll find your stuff out on the side walk. I expect Christian behavior in my home. No profanity, no noise, no electric hair curlings. Lights out at 10:00. Don't waste hot water. And no men. I repeat, no men allowed upstairs, ever. You hear me? Hey! I'm Jeannie. I'll be right next door if you need me, okay? Yuck! The old bat gave you the Black Hole of Calcutta. Listen, why don't you come over to my place? I got a red silk pillow I could loan you. Lord knows it'll be a start. Come on.Okay. Oh, I didn't get your name. Callie Lord. Nice to know you, Callie Lord. I'm Jeannie Everly. "No cooking, no electric hair curling, "lights out at 10:00, don't waste hot water," which I did. "And no men. Repeat, no men allowed upstairs, ever." Shoot. What does that old bat know about men. She ain't had one since the Indian. Flat feet on a waitress are worse than a flat chest on a stripper. My toes are killing me. Hey, you got a job? No, but I sure could use one. Listen, that was just between you and me, okay, 'cause I don't really know for sure, but... There may be a job opening down at the cafe where I work. There's this old gal named Ruthie. She thinks she's fixing to quit, found a husband. Lord knows she's ugly. I don't how she ever managed matrimony. Thanks, but, uh, I think I'll probably just look around a bit more. Well, excuse me! Didn't mean to twist your arm or anything, hon. No, there's nothing wrong with being a waitress. It's just that I kinda had a little something more in mind, that's all. Sure. Come on, sit. It's hot, now. As soon as my husband gets back from Korea, we're gonna move out to a farm. You married? Oh, yeah, twice. Well... More like one-and-a-half, actually. The first didn't last out the weekend. They were about the best 15 at the time. Oh, this tune. Come here, I wanna show you a new step. Oh, you probably know it, anyway. Come on, count. I don't know what to do. Don't they dance where you come from? Not really. What's a little ol' thing like you doing in Dallas, anyway? Oh, wait, wait. Well, let me guess. You wouldn't be running away now, would you? Hey, come here. Come on here, I want to do something about that hair of yours. Come here. I don't want to hurt your feelings or nothing, but you look like a runner up to Miss Turner Green. Hey, you know, when I was a little girl, my mama used to do this for me. She had sit me down and she'd say, "Now, Jeannie Louise, "before you go to bed tonight, "I want you to count your blessings. "You'll probably be surprised just how well off you are." Miss Callie, you don't have anything to worry about. I mean, you... You got a new town. Got a new place to live. Got a new friend. And you got a new hairdo. Wow. Well, I guess all we need now is to find you a job and a real rich fellow with a heart condition. I'm really grateful to you. You know, you've got more than most people have on their plates. You don't have anything to worry about, hon, not the way you look. Well, hoopsie do. Oh, come on, hon, you'll see, it's not gonna be so bad. Hey, listen. If anybody has busy hands, you just say no. They keep it up, you come and tell Aunt Jeannie, and she'll pour hot coffee down their red necks. That's a safe one to start with. Comes in here every morning, he never says a word to you. He doesn't take anything but coffee, but he leaves a quarter tip. I think his name's Mr. Bordeaux. Works for the newspaper or something. Good luck. Good morning, Mr. Bordeaux.Morning. How'd you make out? I got about $6, I think. Six bucks? That is semi-sensational. Hey, you wanna go over to the Silver Spur tonight and celebrate? I've met me a man there once. Said he's a real life lion tamer. Well, I don't think so. I've kinda got plans already, thanks. Sure. It's fine. I got me a baby boy. He's almost one. Quite a bronco, too. He's already walking. I bet he's adorable. I don't believe this. It seems like you could have told me before 6:15. I just got here? I just... Drop the curtain. But don't make a reservation! Well, damn... Damn, damn! There's trash, and then there's trash. Another hot night between the pages, huh? Yeah. Yeah. You ain't gonna find a husband in there. I ain't looking for one. What are you looking for? I don't know. Maybe I could be a better person. Learn a few things. Well, I prescribe, personally, a little fun. Hey. Have I ever asked you a favor before, ever? No. Well, get ready, 'cause here's the first night. I want you to get that widely sought after behind of yours right out of that bed and come have a double date with me. Oh, no, listen, I got two genuine old men. They're gonna take us to a real fancy restaurant with real expensive nice wines, soft music, candle light, la-di-da-do-da-di. Come on. Come on. Thanks. I don't think so. Well, what's the matter with you, hon? Don't you like men? Well, I don't dislike them. Well, you haven't had three dates in the last year. Jeannie, I don't even know what to say to a guy. The best word's no. Well, you could just... You could just sort of smile a lot and make them think you're mysterious. I'd rather read. You won't do it for yourself, would you do it for me? Jeannie... Oh, please. Oh, pretty, please. All right. All right. Oh! Whoo! Come on, let's get out of here. Bye. Whoo! I'm sorry, hon. Well, sometimes in the oil business, you just hit a dry hole. Oh, that's for sure. That guy was such a creep. Did you see that old fusspot? Hey, look, it's for you.Yeah. Yeah. Listen, can we go over to your room? I'd like to... I don't wanna be alone. Sure. Are you all right? Aren't you gonna open it? I've never got one of these things before. Well, open it. I can't. You read it to me. Please. Well? I can't, Jeannie. Read it. "We regret to inform you "that your husband, Corporal William P. Everly "was killed in action in heavy fighting at the 38th parallel. "President Truman and the nation extend their deepest sympathies. "Carl Tipper, U.S. Department of Defense." Jeannie, I'm so sorry. You know the funny thing? I remember what Billy looked like. I can't remember how he felt. We were only together a couple of weeks. But I loved him. That Korean war wouldn't finish, you know. He promised me he'd only be gone a couple of months and... He said he was gonna come back and we were gonna buy a farm. What can I do? It's shameful not to remember what your own husband felt like. Could I... Could I borrow a Kleenex? Yeah. Maybe a glass of water. Here you go. I found one in your drawer? You want me to call a doctor or a preacher or anything? No, no. No, this is gonna do. Number two's finished, and now I'll look for number three, that's all. Jeannie... Well, it's true. When I find him, he'll be climbing telephone poles or fixing washing machines, or selling cars. He won't be any better or any worse than the rest. Are you sure... One thing's for sure, he's that guy. There's no law that says you've gotta settle. Oh, sure, there is, it's Jeannie's law. You get what's coming to you. Hey. You got a kid stashed away some place? Kid? No. Well, I know you ain't pregnant. Well, of course, I'm not. What are all of them baby clothes doing in the drawer? Oh, it's for my nephew. I got me a little nephew, and he's just, you know, he's real cute. Look, I don't want to be nosy. Do you want to talk about it? No, thank you. Now, look, Callie, I know something's hurting you. Hey, tell Aunt Jeannie. Get my mind off that telegram. There's nothing left to tell... And besides, you'd probably hate me, anyway. Oh, honey. Hey, you. We're best friends. Warts and all, remember? There's nothing you could do to make me hate you. Nothing. It's just I didn't know what to do. And I couldn't keep my baby, so I had to give him away. Oh. Oh. Lawyers. What they say is about as important as cow chips. I just wanna see my little boy, to make sure he's all right, and I don't know how to do that. Well, I might know somebody. Well, Jeannie had a friend who bowled every Friday night with a private eye named Clyde Deacon. Now, he specialized in what was euphemistically termed divorce evidence. But the feeling was he might help Callie find her baby son. Clyde Deacon alas did not turn out to be a savior. But I'm getting ahead of the story. You have no idea how hard they make these things. To protect the child, mainly. I see. Was the adoption legal or black market? I don't know. The lawyer had all these papers. Did you get copies? No, uh-uh. That's what I figured. Well, is it possible? Nothing's impossible. It'll take time and money. There'll be a lot of hands to shake. I'll pay whatever you say. It's just I can't go on much long without at least seeing my little boy. Oh, well, 500 ought to get the ball rolling. $500? In cash. You see, somebody might wanna trace this later on. Anything else on your mind? Only my baby. You're right determined. For a waitress. Mr. Deacon, I don't intend to be a waitress all my life. Ta-da! Oh, my Lord. I hope you can stand this much beauty on one person. Jeannie. I look like a damn sheep dog. Well, Mamie Eisenhower.Cute. It is not cute. Did you know that a court reporter can make $500 a month easy. Hello? Yes, this is her. Hi... How soon do you need it? Um, of course I want you to keep trying. Okay. Bye. Who was that? It was Deacon. He needs $200 more. For what? I thought you gave him $950? He's real close, Jeannie. He traced the family from Texarkana to Shreveport. Counsel pleaded... The prosecution used three peremptory strikes. Yes, Callie. Uh, could you repeat that last part, please? They don't repeat testimony in a courtroom, Miss Lord. Yes, ma'am. Nobody home. Deacon had skipped. Callie was taken once again. She vowed this was the last time, that she'd never forget Clyde Deacon. Sorry, I'm late. Let the record show the deposition of Mr. Randall Bordeaux, Jr. Was taken at 2:00 p.m., April 15, 1953. Present were Ralph Heynard, attorney for the plaintiff, Samuel Ripkin, and Horace Johnston, counselor for Mr. Bordeaux. What is your name, miss? Callie Lord. And Callie Lord adjuring the court's reporting company. This deposition is in the matter of a civil liable suit brought against Mr. Randall Bordeaux. The membership committee and I just don't... Good night. Good night. Oh, excuse me, miss. Ah, well, see you later. Okay, thank you very much. I... I didn't get a chance to thank you for staying so late up there through all that nonsense. Oh, it's all right. No, I enjoyed it. You handled things quiet beautifully, too, I think. Oh, thank you. Well, can I give you a lift or... No, I just thought I'd go find myself a real cup of coffee. I think it's time. Well, I could use a cup of coffee myself. Black with two sugars, I think. Good Lord. Miss... Miss Lord? I did not make the connection. People said Callie set her cap that night for the most eligible bachelor in Dallas. Wrong. Just men and women discovering a lot in common. It seems that love always happens when you're not out looking for it. Ah, miss those old people. Don't you have any family here? No. Newspaper. Newspaper's my family. My mother, my wife, my child, my friend. And my enemy. Do you mind if I say... I think you're remarkable. You know, you can say that as often as you like. I would like to say that you handled yourself very well. You held your temper in that room today. I mean, I know I'm not supposed to take sides, but... That libel suit is as leaky as grandma's milk. Now, if I was you, I'd turn right round and sue the behinds of those people. I may do that, Callie Lord. Callie Lord. I like that name... And the person it belongs to. Might I see that person again sometime? If you like. Here's where I come in. And what a night it was. Social Dallas was out in force, bejeweled, bedecked and hell-bent on scrutinizing the commoner who'd married a prince. I can't say I blame Randall for wanting to show her off. Just sorry I didn't meet her first. Whatever. It seemed that fate had finally dealt Callie a good card. Hi.Hi. You take my breath away. Why, thank... Oh. I wish we hadn't even invited anybody else. So do I. Hi, how are you? Good to see you. Evening, how are you? Howdy, how you doing? Good to see you. Randall, this is my good friend, Jeannie. Oh, sure, I remember Jeannie. How are ya? Yeah. Welcome to our home. Thank you. I think you did very well for yourself, Mr. Bordeaux. Oh, it's Randall, but I quite agree with you. All of them books you read. I knew I should have got me a library card. Howdy, Randall. Oh, Senator, how are you? Senator and Mrs. Houseman, I want you to meet my wife Callie. Darling? Hmm. Will the groom allow the bride a little recess? Yeah. Sure, don't be gone too long. Okay. Thank you. Well, you certainly do look lovely, Mrs. Bordeaux. Thank you. Did you buy that frock in Chillicothe? Hello. Evening, ma'am. I gather you have the same tolerance for these tribal rites as I do. I just needed a little air, Mr... We haven't met yet. My name's Kimball Smythe, and I'm neither rich nor famous, but fairly civilized, anyway. I teach Political Science at SMU. That's nice, Mr. Smythe. I guess I, uh, best be getting back to Randall now. You don't seem too anxious to go back inside. Tell me. Have these old crocodiles been snapping at you? Little more than I expected. Isn't exactly the most popular marriage in Dallas this year. Mmm-hmm. Well, you better come with me. I'll give you a little food for thought. Please observe, right in front of us there. That painted gourd squash, the one with the cherry on top, Miss Cara Peabody. Now, believe it or not, she was once the most celebrated hooker in East Texas. They say, that on one memorable weekend in 1937, she entertained 53 customers, one of whom struck oil on Monday morning, gave her $50,000 and a wedding ring as tribute. Oh, and right through there, you might observe that rare species ad Ludie England, arbiter of all that's rich and beauteous. Yes, and she makes me feel like I should use the servant's entrance. Listen, she's formally known as Blanche Guberman. Guberman... Yep. Yeah. Old Blanche ran a horse... She shot and killed two lovers, for which she escaped punishment by pleading self-defense. Both men and my dad got bullets in their back. Now, that was 30 years ago, which is an absolute miracle, because she told me, personally, she's only 28. No. No, it is a fact. Thank you very much. You have made your point. Wait a minute, Professor. How'd you get in here? Hi.Uh-oh. Uh-oh. Always the back fence. I have to ease my way into these major events. This character tell you he's about my oldest friend? No. 'Cause anything he tells you, it's best to disbelief. I speak only the truth, just like everything is printed in your newspaper. Congratulations, Randy. I think you got the gold cup. Thank you. Have I told you lately how much I love you? Hmm. How proud I am of you? Not since midnight. That was 10 minutes ago. Oh. Mmm. Oh! You two kissed? Just adorable! I've never been to a better wedding party, and I've had three. Jeannie, where's number three, by the way? Oh, he ran off with some heifer. Oh. Why is it every man I marry has 15 cents in his pocket, eight outstanding traffic tickets, and the charm of a Bremer bull. Wish we'd met 10 years ago. I'd have qualified on all counts. Good lord, Willie Chips. Where is the party? Where did everybody go? You old pea-picker. Ladies, I'd like to present this former Dallas roughneck, who is now the proud owner of 255 gas and oil wells right outside of Weatherford. Uh, uh, uh, 257. Got lucky this morning. Is that real oil or snake oil? Well, hoop-dee-doo. Did you see the way she put the heel, huh? Do you wanna go with this three column article about Mamie at Gettysburg? No, No. I think we should use something of a more local nature. You know, we still have, what, 12 stamp photographers? Hi.Hey, darling. Why didn't you call? Gentlemen, you all know my wife. Oh, please be seated. May I speak to you? Uh, well, yeah, uh... It's kind of private. All right, darling, what... Excuse me, boys. I'll be right back. Sure this can't wait about an hour? We're on a deadline here. No, I can't wait one more minute. I just came from the doctor and he told me I am thoroughly pregnant. You're what? I'm growin' our baby. Are you sure? Yes! Congratulations, boss. You want that on page one? Hey, ladies, where do you want this thing? Oh, my God. Look who's here. Okay, put him right over there. They'd have been cheaper if we would've bought a real one. You get all weird, number four. You give me a kiss. Hold it, fast one. Just one minute. One minute. That's my dumpling. One thing's for sure, that kid will never be spoiled. Oh, no. Look at here. Look at here. Willie, you shouldn't have. You know, I got him a Davy Crockett outfit on order. Oh, thank you. Thank you. Hey, you want me to put these diapers in this drawer here? You okay, honey? Just a little gas pain. Oh. Callie! Honey! Willie! Call an ambulance! Honey! Dr. Melwood says you're a lot better today. In fact, he said, two or three more weeks and you'll be good as new. He also said you are not eating. You've got to start eating. Now, if you don't like the food here, I'll just call the Petroleum Club and have them send a tray over. Would you like that? Hmm? It's God's will. He's paying me back. Darling, wait a minute, I don't even want you to think like that. It's not anybody's will. But it is. He waited for just the right moment to punish me. No, no. Listen, listen. Listen to me a minute, okay? I got a great idea. Soon as the doctor says it's okay, why don't you and me just take a trip together, alone? Did the doctor tell you I can't ever have a baby again, ever? I don't care. As long as we're together. Nothing's ever gonna grow inside me again. I should've told you this a long time ago. This ain't the first baby I've lost. What do you mean? Was it a boy? Randall, tell me. Was he well-formed? Callie, Callie. We promised we wouldn't ever talk about that, yesterday, remember? The first one was. He was a fine boy. He was beautiful. He was healthy. And, uh... I just sold him. Like a basket of vegetables, here's the money and here's the baby. What are you talking about? Oh! Why? Why did God wait so long? He waited till just now to punish me. Oh, it's so... Thank you, sir. Good evening. Okay. Easy, darling. Come on, let me give me you a hand. Welcome home, Mrs. Bordeaux. Not many people knew how sick Callie was. She stayed three months in the hospital, and at least twice, the doctor said she was dying of internal bleeding. But it was grief, shame. The day Randall brought her home, she was pale and lost. She didn't know he had a surprise waiting. He worked his tail off to keep Callie alive and sane. Randal turned Texas upside down, and this is what he wrought. I told you I wanted this room closed and locked forever. Just trust me, okay. Whose child is this? I think you know, don't you? How'd you find him? It wasn't easy. Well, go on. Introduce yourself. Honey. You know who I am? Is it really him? Of course, it is. Can't you tell? Well, I can't believe it. Yeah. And you can believe this, too. They named him Randolph. He answers to Randy. Randy? My name is Callie. And I'm your mama. And I love you more than you'll ever know. Could I, maybe, have a little kiss? Just one little teeny, tiny kiss right here? Please. Oh! I'm so sorry I left you. And I'll never do it again. And you listen to me. I promise you, I will never leave you again, ever. 'Cause I love you. I love you so much. I've got all the love in the world for you, baby. I really do. And you're gonna see it. Oh, my God! Whoo! Randy? Mmm? Happy birthday, boy. Come on. It's time to get into your own bed now, come on. Here we go. Come here, boy. Hi. Hey. How're you doing? Fine. How're you doing? Good.Mmm. How was your flight? Long. We had to land in Memphis. How was the President? You know, he's very impressive. Did he mention anything about our Bay of Pigs editorial? I think the word "Judas" came up a couple of times, yeah. Oh, dear. Don't worry about it, though. I didn't tell him who came up with the line "Fools rush in." Listen, darling. I don't know exactly how to say this. I don't wanna blow it out of proportion, but... I think... I think Randy's too big to be sleeping in here now. Well, he couldn't sleep. His stomach hurt. He ate too much birthday cake. You do remember today was his birthday, don't you? Yes. Just wanted to get his little book, climb up in bed with mama and read for a while. Is there anything wrong with that? Let's talk about it tomorrow. Why, what's there to talk about? All right. This is what I think. Randy's not developing properly. His grades are terrible. I think you and he would benefit if we went ahead and sent him to that prep school up in Connecticut. I can't believe you still want to exile a 12-year-old child 2,000 miles away from home. What do you mean, "exile"? You know, there's just a slight possibility he might learn something up there. Randy is a bright boy, he has simply not been challenged properly, that's all. He never will be as long as you keep protecting him. Oh, now protecting my son is a maternal felony? All right, let me use another word, then. As long as you keep smothering him. I'll be the judge of that. What? I said, "I'll be the judge of that." Callie, you know... You're a wonderful mother, but he's my boy, too. He's not yours, he's mine. Who found him? Who bore him? Okay. You're the mother. I'm the father. Let's just leave it at that. All right. You know, you keep whipping me, I'm going to take up golf. I don't have to take this kind of abuse, you know? You've never played better in your life. What? You nearly got a game there. Fifteen-love, in... Please! Listen... You called Ted Sorensen? Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah. I suggested to him that the President just skip us on this trip. He can. Jack's growled so long, so loud about oil and steel. You've got to come down here, show people there's no blood on his fangs. I hope he brings Jackie with him as a diversion. You heard what happened to Adlai Stevenson the other day, didn't you? Yeah. Some of our local patriots whacked him over the head with one of those, uh... "Get out of the UN" picket signs. Yeah. Number of nuts always bound to fall out of the tree in Dallas. How's Callie? She's good. Randy's her whole life. Yeah, but she's so smart, I wish she'd get interested in something else. Yeah, for a self-educated woman, she amazes me. Knows her politics.Yeah. Listen, why don't you try to find her a job on the newspaper? Election year's coming up. That's terrific, except that... Problem is, it's a package deal, see? Callie and Son. Indeed, they were a package deal. A veritable corporation. Callie and Son. She's bound and determined that Randy had it in him to write like Hemingway. Callie crossed that narrow line between possession and obsession. She never even noticed, the harder she squeezed, the more her son was slipping away from her. Yeah, are you watching? Now listen, darling, we've got to be at the trademark by 12:15, sharp. Well, we have to be seated before Jack and Jackie get there. Yeah. Well, listen, tell Randy he's gonna get a chance to shake hands with the President. Okay? What? Darling, it doesn't make any difference what you wear. You're going to look great no matter what you put on. Yeah, okay. All right, I'll see you there, okay? I love you, bye-bye. All set? Thank you. Cheering and yelling going on down the way, as they approach the car. Secret Service right along with the President, of course. President passes right in front of a Dallas police officer, right in front of our cameras now. Somebody patted his shoulder. Mrs. Kennedy coming along behind him, grinning all the while. President saying, "Thank you very much," if I maybe be permitted to read a Presidential lip movement. And, uh... I talked to Horace today. Another lawsuit, my goodness. No, I decided to sell the paper. Why? Honey, the economy's picking up... it doesn't have anything to do with dollars and cents. But why, then? The Post Dispatch has been in your family over 100 years. Maybe it's just because... Life right now is so unsettled. I don't know. But I think when they shot Jack Kennedy... He was so young and vital, and... I haven't been able to shake that. Darling, I love you so much. And I love our son. I just think it's time for us to get off this treadmill and find some time for ourselves. Maybe raise a few head of cattle, and Randy loves the land. He's always loved the land. Well, that's very touching, darling, but, uh... I understand your concern, but you and I have, both, devoted ourselves to Randy taking over the paper someday. Now, if you sell it, you're gonna strip our son of his inheritance. Is that your plan? Plan? How can you plan anything in this day and age, with all the lunatics running around the world? Darling... You'll get over this depression. I want you to promise me something. I want you to promise you won't make any decisions until you get over the pain of Kennedy's death. And after that, Randy and I will back you in whatever you want. Okay? Please. Okay. I love you. I'm here to see the city editor. Is he expecting you? Yes. I'm a little early. I'll just go on in. Sir, it's better to wait out here. I will announce you. Which one of you bastards wrote this? Who gave you the right to print lies about me, huh? Another madman, another gun. Three more lives lost to the legions of lunatics with grievances and trigger fingers. Randall died before he hit the City Room floor. We gave him a big funeral. Bishops, eulogies, tears, the works. In the '60s, we were getting it down pat. Callie took his death a lot harder than I would have expected. I never realized how much she loved my best friend. I wonder if Randall knew. I hope he did. Samuel says you got to eat, Mama. I miss him, too, Mama. I know you do, darling. I know you do. What are we going to do, Mama? It's going to be all right. It's going to be fine. I promise you that. I promise you that. Good morning. May I have a chair for my son, please? Mrs. Bordeaux, there are no words to describe our profound sense of loss and waste... Thank you. Please continue. Uh... As you know, Mr. Bordeaux turned down a recent offer to sell his newspaper. Yes, we shared all decisions. It, uh, then became his intention to... Turn ownership of the Dallas Post Dispatch over to its employees. Uh, he was fairly well along in the formation of this plan when, uh... Please go on. Well, perhaps, Horace Johnston can better explain these documents. Mrs. Bordeaux, as, uh, your late husband's personal counsel, and with all due respect, these documents represent the transfer of ownership from your late husband's estate to an employee committee. All vested employees of this newspaper will become owners. We propose to offer the generous sum of $11 and 75 cents per share. Excuse me. Excuse me. Gentlemen... I hope there has not been a misunderstanding. The Dallas Post Dispatch was founded by my late husband's great-grandfather. It has been owned and edited by a Bordeaux for four generations. And thus, it will continue. My son will one day be the fifth. I want this run, tomorrow, page one. All editions. It is an announcement that Mrs. Randall Bordeaux is accepting the editorship of the Dallas Post Dispatch. And she is assuring our readership that this great newspaper's tradition and integrity will not only be continued, but infused with new vitality. Tomorrow morning, at 7:00 a.m., I will be taking over my husband's desk. And at 7:15, I will expect to have the regular news meeting. Mrs. Bordeaux, I... I know how grieved you are over Randall's tragic passing. But I cannot believe you'd go against his wishes. Mr. Donohue, I believe that since I am the widow of Randall Bordeaux, and that since I slept next to him every night for the past 12 years, I am in a better position to express my husband's wishes than you. Now, if you find fault with the new editor of this paper, I feel certain that your resignation will be accepted. Yes. Fine. Any more questions? Here's what I mean. This lead goes on forever. It is endless. A speech by the President of the chamber of commerce is worth two graphs, maximum. It is boring. Yet, back here on page 27, I found a little, tiny item. And it's a hell of a story about a farmer who shot his wife. He shot his wife's lover and the horse that fella rode in on. Now that, my friends, is page 1. I want... No, correction, I demand that every word in this paper be bright and interesting. Because if it bores you, Lord knows, it's gonna bore the people right to sleep. Don't you think? To the surprise of just about everyone but me, Callie became one hell of a newspaper woman. She slapped new paint on the old lay and circulation went up to 22% the first year. There's just two things in her life, the paper and Randy. She earned power, and she used it in 1968. She's voted one of the 10 most admired women in America. But she went to bed alone. Callie, darling, it's Ludie. Oh, the paper looks wonderful, so fascinating. But I haven't read a word about the Hollyhock Ball. It's such a good cause. The Society page seems bereft without it. Oh, Ludie, you're absolutely right. The debutantes are the very soul of Society page, however, we don't have a society page anymore. It's called Today's Woman. And this afternoon, we are featuring a black woman. She makes patchwork quilts and she sells them for $1,000 a piece to boutiques. She also gives half of her money to Martin Luther King. Isn't that something? Toodle-loo. Trash, absolute trash. I knew it the minute I laid eyes on her. There's not much left, just the routine stuff. It was kind of commissioned as J. Peace We have recommendations. Do you wanna use the space? Well, I want this paper to present a choice, whatever position on the ballot. Okay, "Justice of the Peace," page six. That's a horse race, you can take your pick, we'd like C.R. Deacon. That wouldn't be Clyde Deacon, would it? Ma'am? Clyde Deacon? I don't... I don't know. Well, check to see if he's a former private detective. If he is, turn him inside out and use Rosen. Excuse me, ma'am, you want me to take our best man off the governor's race and have him check out of JP county. You heard me correctly. If there's one thing this paper does stand for, it's justice across the board. Hi, baby. Sorry I missed our dinner. Did Samuel fix you a tray? We put out two extra dishes tonight, and they sold out just like that. I've never seen anything like it. And I suspect that you've been smoking. It ain't your basic filter tip, Mom. You want to try some? I suggest you read page one of the Night Final. Judge Bricker just gave two boys 30 years in the State Penitentiary for marijuana possession. Yeah, I read page one of the Night Final. Interesting social notes from all over. Did you happen to read that bitty little item about Bobby Kennedy getting shot to death in LA? Do not be facetious with me. Oh, I wouldn't dream of it, Mama. I'm real pragmatic. I figured I got two choices, I can go get my butt blown off in Vietnam, or I can stop a bullet right here at home. Baby, you have plenty of options... And don't call me "baby"! I'm 18 years old! You have plenty of options. Now Kimball is fixing it up, so you can go to the University of Texas. They have an excellent Journalism department there. I haven't got the grades, Mama, and you know it. Besides, what if I don't want to go? What if me and Pete decide..."Pete and I," please? Whatever. What if we decide to split? I don't know, maybe bum around Europe. Well, it's impossible. You go to college, or you get drafted. Mama, I don't know who I am. You are the heir to a great newspaper, that's who you are. And I have been working 18 hours a day trying to keep that paper going for you. Mama, please, give me some room. I have never made a decision in my life. I'm worried about your attitude. It is rather poor. Yeah, but it's my own, Mama. At least let me have my own damn attitude. I want you to be happy. Mama, I'm not ambitious. I... I can't fulfill your dreams! And I want you to realize your potential, Randall. Mama, you want to know the truth? I don't give a diddly-squat. Randall... Oh, go fight the war, Mama. Go write some patriotic editorials about the need to protect San Francisco from Viet Cong invasion. That's enough. Go on, Mama, you go sell them papers. Come on, Mama, kick some butt. Enough! All right, this is all we could dig up on Clyde Deacon. His detective business went broke, and he went to law school nights. Got a good reputation in his neighborhood. Only black mark we can find is that the IRS has been investigating the last couple of years, no income tax done. Fine. Develop the story and run it. Uh, respectfully, ma'am, I'm being audited for 1967, too. It's not a capital offense. I don't want any man sitting on the bench who cheats on his taxes or goes bankrupt. Excuse me, gentlemen. Hi! I'm sorry, I know we're already late for dinner. There's a little girl outside from Channel 9, she wants to do a real quick interview before we leave. I'm afraid my Vietnam editorial kicked up quite a dust storm. Congratulations. I'm surprised the White House hasn't called. They have. Twice. Oh! Well, then, Mrs. Bordeaux, why did your newspaper make such an abrupt about-face and come out against further U.S. involvement in Vietnam? My words speak for themselves. I did sign the editorial. You do have a 18-year-old son of draft age, Mrs. Bordeaux. Did that affect your decision? I don't think so. Randy is a fine young man, and he would willingly serve his country if needed. Thank you. This is Susan Moore talking to Callie Lord Bordeaux. Well, you handled that television girl pretty good. I thought she's kind of pushy. Well, she's ambitious. They all are. When's Randy leaving for Austin? Next week. And thank you again for all you did. You signed the check? A little chilly in here, don't you think? You know, somewhere between the salad and that drink, I lost you. I'm sorry. Well, anything wrong? No, I'm just a little worried about Randy. Hmm. Every mother in America is worried about Randy. Looks like we've got new rules for the game of parenting. Well, I guess I ought to be going. I've got a 8:00 a.m. meeting with... Look, in all of your reading, did you ever come across Freud's definition of maturity? No. Well, it's someone who works and loves productively. Well, what's wrong with 50%? Thank you for dinner. What do I have to do? You know, I've tried my tweedy intellectual number, my Southern gallant act, my devoted companion impression... I'm afraid that didn't work, either. Kimball, please don't wait for me. Please. Why don't you just be honest with yourself, Callie? You're as lonely as I am. How many times do you wake up at night? I don't have time in my life for anyone else. You can't go to bed with the newspaper, Callie. Or Randy. That's beneath you. You're right. It is. So I'll just say it straight out. I love you. I've always loved you. Always will. Please don't waste your love on a woman who can't accept it. Good night. Yeah? - It's Mr. Deacon again. - He says it's urgent. I don't want to talk to him. Ever. Now just make some excuse or hang up. Just hang up. Callie! Are you all right? I came as soon as I could. How did this happen? I don't understand. He was fine last night. And then he got up this morning and he went down to have coffee, and listen to the livestock report like he always does. And then I came downstairs and he poured me a cup. And then, he started to hand it to me and his hands started shaking like this, and his body started shaking, and he dropped the cup out of his hand. And then he just looked at me, and he didn't say anything. He just looked at me with all this love in his eyes. I don't understand. What did the doctor say? He's not gonna make it. His heart is worn out. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. His heart is worn out. Come here. Why... Honey. Callie's come to see us. Hi, there, Willie Chips. What the hell do you think you're doing? Who's gonna take me to Avalon this year? What, honey? I love you, Willie Chips. I love you. I've got a proposition for you, Mama. Oh, all right. I was thinking, now that I graduated, how'd it be, if I moved on out here to the ranch, maybe ran a few cattle? Is that why you lured me out here? Well, the answer is no. Why? Why not? I'm 21. Well, honey, you're running away from your responsibilities. Well, they're your responsibilities, Mama. You've been writing my script for me ever since I fell off my horse, on my sixth birthday party. Right here at this ranch, remember? I need you at the paper, Randy. You don't need me to shine light on your life, Mama. You're a damn star. No. The answer is no. I got a compromise for you. What? Compromise, the best LBJ tradition. I give you one year out of my life. I work my butt off for the paper. But if I don't fit the glove, I come on back here? You're on. Hmm. Race you back.Fine. Winner take all? You got it. - All right. - Hey! If you want to know who won that race, it was Randy. Callie's horse spotted a jack rabbit, reared up, and Callie got tossed on her buckskins. Randy collected his mama, and was ever so proud to carry her home, behind him, so to speak. This is real sweet of you, Callie. I'm glad you made me come. I haven't been out of the house for months. Well, you look wonderful. Oh, yeah, well, merry widow.Uh-huh. Ain't what it's cracked up to be, kid. Two merry widows, thank you. All dressed up, but no place to go. Anybody new in your life? Shoot, no. Well, I was looking at the pool man with carnal interest the other day. But I don't think he has a grandmother fetish. I do admire your resilience, woman. My what? The way you bounce back. Oh. It's called bluff.Yeah. Well, it's a valuable tool. Don't talk dirty. Will you stop it. Listen, this is not exactly a mission of mercy. I didn't think so, Pinocchio. I've got a proposition for you. Oh, good, I could use one. I'm gonna drop the syndicated column down at the paper. They're getting silly and they're just asking for too much money. I'm not gonna go for it. How would you like to take over the Broken Hearts department. Me? I can't even speak the King's English, much less write it. Don't be silly. Jeannie, it doesn't matter... No. We've editors to fix your grammar. What I want is your wit and your common sense. Oh. What kind of letters will I have to be answering. Divorce, adultery, death, rotten kids. That sort of thing. Oh, that. I thought you meant serious problems. Okay. Yeah? I'll try. You're on. Why not? I think it's great. Hey. flatbed truck turned over, scattered all over a soybean field. Yeah, all right. Just... Just leave it, kid. Okay? Junior just wrote the world's worst obit. You got any new ideas? Uh... Give him that shopping center nonsense. Nobody could screw that up. Please, God, let this keep the little prince off our backs... Funny, the way the right thing happens at the wrong time. That shopping center nonsense might have won the little prince both maturity and severance from his mama. He wrote an article that finally lived up to Callie's expectation. But this time, he wasn't supposed to. I wonder if she really wanted him to succeed. Mama. You look like the Waco Tornado. What happened? You know that place where Daddy and I used to go camping out in the old Elkins Ranch. All right, well, some outfit called North Tex tends to pave over the last beautiful place in this part of Texas. Now, it's inadequate financing, one of the partners has Vegas connections. And I think, I can't prove it, but I think that somebody down in City Hall got paid off to buy the permit. Now, I spent three weeks digging all this out. And another two weeks writing the first and only story I have ever believed in. And I might just as well blow my nose with it, somebody shot it down. Honey, sit down. I read your article, it's excellent. Sit for a minute. Really, Mama? You think so? I think, it is first grade. Um... I'm very proud of you. Feet, please. But a newspaper has certain responsibilities, Randy. One of which is to promote the city's growth, to create new jobs broaden the tax base. Well, what's your point, Mama? Can't our paper help keep one lousy place for your pizza parlors? I think we ought to explore this later. It's just a little too complex. Why? I'm capable of understanding something complex. Try me. Randy, I said later, please. I think you have no intention of running my story. Not for the time being. All right. I'm not gonna work for your piss-ant paper. Good bye, Mama. Action Group, Bordeaux here. A happy New Year to you, too, Mama. No. No plans, though. Just gonna watch Cotton Bowl on the tube. All right. Yes, ma'am, it has been a long time. Yes, ma'am. I've been hearing some wonderful things about your organization. The way you should. Judge Haran just granted us an injunction against North Tex. That story you wouldn't run in your paper paid off. Well, you must be proud. Yeah, it's okay. Frustrating. How so? M-O-N-E-Y. Lack thereof. Would you like a loan against your trust fund? No, ma'am. Thought I'd fly solo for a while. Right. How's your life? You, uh, have any new friends? Maybe a special girl? How's yours? How's Kimball? I'm married to the paper, you know that. Besides, I can't exactly deny the mirror these days. Oh, now, come on, Mama. I'd say you're a pretty dynamite-looking chick. But, to you, as a vernacular. Well, thank you, I think. Well, happy New Year, everybody. Happy New Year to you, too. Happy New Year, Randy. It's real good to see mother and son supping together the first day of the new year. Thanks, Smythe. Listen, have a little dinner with him. Black-eyed peas for good luck. Yuck! Disgusting food. Then have a glass of champagne. No, thanks. But I'll have just a touch of brandy, Samuel. You know. Kimball, I'm glad you stopped by. I had the most delicious idea coming to my mind. Aren't you trying to find someone to run for the unexpired portion of Homer Wiggins' legislative term? Uh, well, that's certainly is a novel idea. Now, who are you all taking about? Oh, someone who might just break every precedent in Austin and actually speak for the people. Oh, you're not being serious. I'm only 22, I don't even have a law degree. Well, that's old enough. We got too many self-serving lawyers down there, anyway. I know less about politics than I do about grand opera. Same thing. Sing loud. Everybody else goes to sleep, anyway. Besides, it's a safe seat. Wha... What, no. Wait a minute. This is... This is crazy. I mean, I... Well, wouldn't it seem just a little hypocritical, me, running a silk stocking district? Darling, I don't care what your lifestyle is now, your name is still Bordeaux. It doesn't matter where you come from. It's what you do when you get to State Capital. But, Mama, I'd be wasting my time. I mean, lobbyists have Austin and... Don't you have the courage to try? Where can you best serve your beliefs? In the store front office, or right in that chamber where those laws are made? I'd vote for you. Well, that's one vote. I do believe this is where the ladies leave and the gentlemen solve the problems of the world. Excuse me. She set us up. Uh, yeah, I believe she did, state representative Bordeaux. That's the last time she's gonna do it. If I win. Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, Mama. I heard you up there playing cheerleader for me. Wasn't he wonderful? Proudest moment of my life, Randy. Oh, thank you, Mama. I want to introduce... Judge. Callie. May I shake your boy's hand. - Yeah. Wonderful speech. Oh, thank you so much. You remember Ted Clairmont, don't you, honey? Yes, yes. My daughter, Martha. How do you do? She just passed the bar. The state bar, that is. Well, congratulations. Thank you. I would be so proud to introduce you to some of my friends. Oh, some more. Thank you, of course. Excuse me. Excuse me. They make an attractive pair. Your Honor is as usual, perceptive. And timely. You have any idea what it is like, to sit at your own wedding rehearsal dinner, all by yourself? Come on, Martha. Just a... You'll feel better. I've already call the police. Probably just had a little car trouble coming out from Austin. But he could've called. I could just die. Yes. Mama? Randy, where are you? Are you all right? We've been worried sick. Guess what? I've got a surprise for you. I'm married! You what? I'm married, Mama. About an hour ago, on the way to Laredo. Oh! I love her, Mama. You will, too. Here, Mama. Here. Mama, hi. This is your new daughter. Sue Lynn Hatcher... I mean, Bordeaux. Oh, God. I just love you and Randy, and everybody. Oh, I can't wait to see my new mama. Mmm. Wanna watch a little TV? Uh, no. Like my new dress, honey? I got it on sale. It was $49.95. It was marked down from $110. Yeah, it's real nice, Sue Lynn. Don't you think, maybe it's a little overstated for a politician's wife? Little music wouldn't disturb your concentration, would it, honey? Randy. Randy. I don't suppose you wanna wrinkle up the sheets a little, would you, honey? No, sugar. I got to finish this. Oh, no. It's just been a long time. You're sitting all... hot and sexy in those blue jeans. I'm sorry, Sue Lynn. I told you, I'm under a lot of pressure. Can you answer me one question? Mmm. Why did you marry me? What? Honey, I can't cook. I can't write a speech. I can't even buy the right clothes. One thing I used to be able to do good was make men like me. Even that don't even seem to be working anymore. Well, that's working, Sue Lynn. Men sure do like to look at you. You don't. Now, why do I have to look? I won the prize. Come here. Come here. Sugar. I married you 'cause I love you. Okay? Okay. Maybe tomorrow night I'll make us this supper I cut out of Cosmopolitan magazine. Okay? That'd be just fine. I can't tomorrow night. We gotta go to Mama's, remember? I told you John Connelly is coming over? Why don't you just let me know, if you'd like to get together just one time between now and legislative adjournment? Okay? Where is she? Over yonder at number 8. She's okay. She hit him with a bottle. Claims he got rough. Who was the man? Been shacked up since last night. You know who he was? Some old cowboy. Sue Lynn turned him every way but loose. He ran off in his boots and his long johns. Thank you very much for handling this, and I do not forget a favor. Yes, ma'am. Good night. Get dressed. I'm taking you home. Yes, ma'am. I'm sorry, Mama. I am not your mama. Mama, I know I did wrong. Mama, please don't tell Randy. Please. Hurry up. I love him, Mama. I really do. Yes, I can see that. Five years passed. Somehow, someway, Randy and Sue Lynn stayed married. But all of us knew the difference between public smiles and private pain. I feel like I was grabbing. I mean, I would like to go to Washington, someday. But, I'm only in my third term in Austin. Randy, come here, darling. Listen to me for a minute. A plum is about to fall off the tree, and It'd be foolish of you not to catch it. As a congressman, you could ally with Nader, You could build a national power base. Callie. One throne at a time, all right? Let the boy decide for himself. We ran a little private poll. Your recognition factor is 72%. That's downright phenomenal. Besides, ever since Watergate, the country is hungry for attractive politicians with clean shirts. And you're clean, son. Now, that's as clear as a diamond in the hog water. There ain't no skeletons in the closet, are there? - No, sir. The other side will poke like a germ under a microscope. Senator, my son's life speaks for itself. Just remember what old Sam Reverend said to the aspiring politician. "Never get caught in bed with a dead woman or a live man." Tomorrow is a school-day, gentlemen. I think we ought to let the candidate... and his wife discuss things together. Bye, Randy. Good night. Bye... Good to see you, young man. Thank you very much, sir. Whoo! Come on, sugar. I'm hungry. So what do you think, sugar? You wanna travel to Washington, D.C.? Whatever you want, honey. It's just fine with me. Honey, there's something I've been wanting to talk to you about. Fire away. Oh, it's nothing. Wait. Oh. Hey, hey. It's not nothing. What is this? Spit it out. Well, I was just thinking about what that man said, you know, about how they check you out and everything. Mmm-hmm. It's true, huh? Sure it is. That may make you? Up one side and down the other. Why? Well, it was a long time ago, and they probably... Sue Lynn, what you talking about? Well, I got this problem, see, and I need $5,000 to fix it. $5,000? Fix what? It was way before we got married, sweetheart. I didn't even... I didn't even know you then. My God. Who are they? Uh... One of them is a district judge, and I think the other one is his bailiff. Sweetheart, will you just help me this time? Please, honey. We'll talk about this at home. Honey, can't we just... Can't we just pay them and then just forget about it? Good night, Mr. Randy, Miss Sue Lynn. Are you kidding? It's only the beginning, and I gotta pay to some bitch-type... Don't say that, please. All right, Sue Lynn. I want some answers. I want some straight answers! Randy, I told you, I was just having a little fun. Fun? My wife and two men in a cheap motel! Randy. What more do you want me to do? I said I was sorry. Goddamn! I should've known this. I should've known you're just a scandal waiting to happen! You knew I wasn't a sweetheart. And you asked me to get married. You seduced me! Well, they better write a new book in the Bible, honey, 'cause that's a certified miracle. You only sleep with me once a year for which I believe you must get your mama's permission. You hit me! You are damn right I hit you! I'll hit you a hell of a lot more, too! They all came. When Callie blew her horn, people danced. The barbeque dove hunt hoe down speechifying rally for Randy really wasn't necessary. He didn't need the vote. Callie wanted to show off her boy. And none of us knew that this was the beginning of the end. Jeannie, let me know just as soon as Vice President Mondale gets here. Oh, I forgot. His office called. He's not gonna be able to come. What? Oh, just listen. He sends his best, and so does Jimmy and Rose. All right. Well, listen. Tell Samuel, please don't let anybody go off on their own. Those doves will wait 'till I get there. Would you stop worrying? Honey, it's in the bag. I knew this was gonna happen! I knew it! I don't understand. He promised he'd give us the negative. Yeah, well, just who in hell is he? I don't know! It's just some post office box. Well, here's a new entry for the candidate's guidebook. Be sure and hold back $25,000 to buy your wife's dirty linen. I don't give a damn about the U.S. Congress. All I want is a husband. Yeah, well, that's just great. You tell me how I'm gonna persuade Mama to write me a check for $25,000. - Oh, are you kidding? - Your mama can buy you the Trinity River if you asked her. Lord, Sue Lynn. Your timing is just beautiful, you know that? I got 200 of the most important people in North Texas out there, waiting to make contributions to my campaign. Now, what am I gonna do? Wrap all of my wife's porno pictures? Hey, honey. I'm sorry. I wouldn't do anything to hurt you. Maybe, I'll just go away. Now, how do I even know there's a blackmailer? Maybe you're just skimming a little cream off the top for yourself, huh? A little private jelly bean jar. Just don't take it any further, Randy, okay? I'll handle it in some way. I tried to change for you, Randy. You know, everybody's done something they're ashamed of. I loved you. I still do, honey. I think, maybe your mama was right. I'm just not good enough for you. Hush, now. Hush. Hush, now. I love you. You're still my little girl. Oh, baby! It's gonna be all right. It's all right. I'll have a vodka martini. Double. No, you don't have to bother with that... All right! Hi! I just want to welcome all you good friends to this little jamboree we have here today. Now, after I'm finished, y'all can go out and shoot every single dove in North Texas if you like. Now, in the meantime... In the meantime, where's the man of the hour. Randy? Here I am. Oh, hi. Come on up here, Randy. How about this youngster, huh? Oh! Now, listen. Even if I wasn't his mama, I would vouch for him, and I'd vote for him. And I would be ever so proud. So, I would like you all to say hello to the next U.S. Congressman for the 24th District. Okay, now, listen, you all have been here before so go on out. Don't everybody go at the same time, all right? Have fun. Go on out and have fun. Hey, Randy, hold up. You got a phone call. They want you back at the house, Randy. Something about The Today Show. Thank you. I'll just walk, anyway. Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart. I'll be back in a minute. Give me that old shot gun of yours. I'm gonna get me some doves. Well, you just be careful now, you hear? You keep the safety on. Oh, hell, Randy. I've been shooting Pearl beer cans off of Daddy's fence since I was five. Yeah, now, you be careful. Okay. Bye. Hello! Hello? Good Lord, Jeannie. How many karats is that thing? I don't know. I just told Cartier's to make it knuckle to knuckle. Randy! Randy! Come on over here and cool off. You got everybody's vote, anyway. Ah, no, ma'am. I can't do that. We've still got an hour of good shooting light left. Oh, Mama. You scared the doodley squat out of me. Sorry. Have any luck? Hell! Next time I want birds, I'll go buy them at the supermarket. You got a cold beer on you? No. Kinda glad we ran into each other, though. I've been wanting to have a little private talk with you. Girl talk? I know you're very proud of Randy, aren't you? Yeah. They say there is no limit to his potential, and I know he's gonna go to Washington and turn that town inside out. Yeah. Randy's wonderful, ain't he? I also know that there's been some problems between the two of you. Mama, that's our problem, okay? Of course. But, we are both grown women. And it's time we faced the fact that a discordant marriage is not attractive, politically. I feel a zinger coming now, Mama. Why don't you just hit me with it? All right. I will be entirely candid. I think you and Randy would be much happier apart, divorced. And I will make it more than worth your while. You should clear this with Randy boy. I told you, this is between you and me. Mama, I don't know a whole lot about politics, but ain't it worse for somebody to be divorced than somebody who's trying to work out marital problems? And besides, you know, you're forgetting one important item. Randy and I love each other very much. Oh, I wish I could believe that. Oh, come on, Mama, you don't wanna believe it! And do you think I'd stay married to that man and his mama if I didn't love him? That's enough. You hate me! You always have. You hate me 'cause I married up! I caught me a rich one just like you, huh, Mama? You watch your mouth. And you've done your best to turn a good man... Shut your mouth! Into a mama's boy! I should have known better than to try and deal with a person of your level. Face it, Mama, you want to sleep with him. Well, I got news for you. He ain't that good! No! Hey, Sue Lynn! Sue Lynn? Thank you, Mr. Bordeaux. And we'll keep you posted. It's all right, honey. Are you all right? Mrs. Bordeaux, may I see you a moment, please? Yeah. Go on. I'll be right back. Sit down, please, Mrs. Bordeaux. Thank you. Can you tell me anything about your daughter-in-law's state of mind? I don't know exactly what you mean. Well, the way she's been acting lately, her health, something she might have said. She's been a little depressed, I suppose. Depressed? Well, the pressure of a campaign is enough to wear anybody out. And she wasn't particularly fond of politics. She had headaches. With all due respect to you, ma'am, did she have any enemies? Someone that might have wanted her dead? No, no, no. Certainly not. We are talking about an accident here, aren't we? Probably. Stray shot kind of thing. You know, people fall down, their shotguns go off. You just go on home now, Mrs. Bordeaux. If anything should come to mind, give me a call. Of course. Detective Hart, I'd like you to know how very pleased I am it's you that's checking into this matter. See, my police reporters speak very highly of you. Thank you kindly, ma'am. Thank you. Come on, Bubba. It's almost midnight. You read the damn file 18 times. Interesting case. Very interesting case. Hell, you ain't gonna make anything out of some old gal blowing herself away. You ever see such a cast of characters? Papers are all over it. The damn New York Times called me today. You can't make bricks without straw. Stand for accidental death and let it go at that. Or suicide. Women don't shoot themselves in the face, Tanner. Don't you know that? Yeah, how come? It's true. You ask any coroner. If a gal's gonna check out, she'll aim at her boobs, she'd never mess up her face. Assumption is, she wants to look her best when she's laid out. Tell you. I wouldn't want the voters to think we're whitewashing a murder just 'cause everybody involved eats high off the hog. Now, the dead wife of an almost United States congressman deserves special handling, don't you think? The grand jury probe into Sue Lynn's death, sold papers in a way Callie never intended. Now one of the readers was an old dog with one bite left in his jaws. Clyde Deacon had been waiting for an opportunity like this. The Dallas Post Dispatch will not tolerate... Mama? Hi! Did you hear the news? The grand jury handed down a murder one indictment on Sue Lynn's death. Murder? It's ridiculous. Who? Yours truly, Mama. You're little boy. Oh... No. No. It couldn't be. No, they couldn't. They couldn't. Don't you worry about it. Mama'll take care of it. Mama will take care of it... Mr. Cotham, why have you come from New York to take this case? Because the distinguished Callie Bordeaux asked me. Hey, is it true that your fee is one million dollars? There cannot be a price on an innocent man's life. What is your defense? The oldest one in the world, innocence. I represent an innocent man who is charged with an accidental death. Well, sir, how long do you think this trial will last? If the judge grants our first motion, about five minutes. Ladies and gentlemen... Ladies and gentlemen, I recognize the box office appeal of this matter. But I remind you that no sound of any kind will be tolerated. And I will not hesitate to eject anyone, no matter what the pedigree. Mr. Cotham, your motion to dismiss will be overruled. Mr. Wrench? Your Honor, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the State of Texas will prove three facts. One, that Sue Lynn Hatcher Bordeaux, age 24, was brutally murdered. Objection, Your Honor. Can Mr. Wrench restrain the use of lurid adjectives? Particularly since it has not even been proved that a murder was committed. Sustained. Please continue. Number two, that it was committed by her husband, State Representative, Randall Bordeaux III. Number three, that the defendant had both motivation and ability to perpetrate this capital offense. Objection. Did the prosecutor misspeak himself with the use of the word, "capital offense"? No, Your Honor. The State believes this crime fits the categories under the Texas revised criminal code for which the death penalty is appropriate. And we will so prove. Officer Curry, you have described yourself as a forensic firearms examiner for the Dallas Police Department. Now, I ask you, if you, uh, me, or a young woman, inexperienced with shotguns, was to drop this weapon, could it discharge and shoot you in the face? Not very likely. I tested it 30 to 40 times. Under the exact conditions, it did not malfunction, it did not discharge. Well, could some person out there in the field that day, say, from about, oh, 20 feet away, have shot Mrs. Bordeaux by mistake? No, sir. Not by the size of the hole on her forehead. Did you or did you not make the sworn statement, "Mr. Randy told Miss Sue Lynn "that this was only the beginning. "He'd have to keep paying that son of a bitch "or else kill him." End quote. I recollect something like that. That's all, Your Honor. The witness is unable to testify as to who was in the apartment, making these melodramatic remarks. It could have been a house guest, it could have been burglars. Oh, no, sir. It was Representative Bordeaux. Well, I've heard him speak. I voted for him. - I don't want a mistrial. - I want an acquittal. I feel you must bear down on the blackmail angle. That's the logical killer. It would help if we could prove there really was a blackmailer. You have a canceled check for $5,000. Ah, but you made that out to Randy and marked it "personal loan." Well, what was I supposed to put down? Blackmail expense? We may not even need the blackmail. I think this case could be won on character witnesses alone. There are plenty of people from the White House on down that would testify on his behalf. Of course. And Sue Lynn's reputation, once established, will give the jury a veritable festival of potential assassins. Is that necessary? Mmm-hmm. It's going well. Is it? Jeannie sent you some cookies. I had to give them to the guard first, though. Tell her thank you. Are you all right? I'm confused. I keep thinking I'm gonna wake up. It is a bad dream, and it'll be over soon. I promise you that. Randy, it's my feeling that the jury must be told the full extent of Sue Lynn's reputation. She's not on trial. A woman with shadows in her life might attract any number of potential enemies. Hon, I had to, uh, clean up a mess one night at a motel when Sue Lynn and some cowboy... I didn't want you to know because... She told me about it. She was mortified. She only did it 'cause I wasn't paying any attention to her. The jury has got to know, Randy. No, they don't! I won't have it! She's dead. Now, you leave her alone. She got us into this, Randall. Did she, Mama? I'm tired, and my head hurts. I love you. That's a given, Mama. Mrs. Chips, where are you employed? The Post-Dispatch. Then it would be correct to say that you are in the pay of Callie Lord Bordeaux? I don't work for the money, if that's what you mean. Callie has been a close friend of mine for the past 30 years. I see. Now, on the day of that mysterious telephone call, you saw Randy come out of the house. Yes, sir. He made sure you saw him. I wouldn't know about that. Randy made sure you saw him walk right by you, didn't he? I saw him, but what he had on his mind, I don't know. Well, if a man were establishing an alibi, he'd make sure you saw him, wouldn't he? Objection! Sustained. After he made sure you saw him, then what'd he do? He went back into the field. He did? Did he say anything? I don't remember. Mrs. Chips, I remind you that you are testifying under oath, subject to the penalties of perjury. I ask you one more time, did he say anything before he went into the field? He said, "There's another good hour of shooting light left." Well, if he was gonna kill somebody, he wouldn't have said that, now would he? Mrs. Bordeaux, we all know what an ordeal this has been, and I appreciate your willingness to testify. Well, I want the truth to come out. The truth! The truth is sometimes slipperier than a greased pig, isn't that so? I've never had any trouble holding on to it. Isn't it the truth, Mrs. Bordeaux, that you were opposed to your son's marriage to Sue Lynn? They eloped. I had nothing to say about it. Isn't it the truth that you thought Sue Lynn was scandal, a millstone around your son's political neck? No. Isn't it the truth that you hated your daughter-in-law? Certainly not. Isn't it the truth that Randy Bordeaux killed his wife in order to please his mama? That is a lie. That is a lie! That's all, Mrs. Bordeaux. Your Honor, the defense calls Randall Bordeaux III. When did you first learn of this blackmail being perpetrated against your wife? Well, that's what we were arguing about the night of July 8th, when all those people overheard us. And did you pay the $5,000? Yes. I borrowed it from my mother, but I didn't tell her the reason. Why didn't you report this extortion to the police? I don't know. I suppose out of love for my wife, not wanting to drag her into headlines. Now, Mr. Bordeaux, may I remind you that you are under oath, subject to the penalties of perjury. Did you kill Sue Lynn Bordeaux? No. Absolutely not. I loved her, as best I could. Thank you. Mr. Bordeaux, just who is this alleged blackmailer? I told you, I don't know his name. Who paid the $5,000? I assume my wife did. She told me so. And then, on the morning of the day she was... On the morning of the day she was shot, she told me the blackmailer wanted another $25,000. Another $25,000. Did you pay it? No.Why not? There wasn't any need, bec... Because? Because my wife was killed. Your Honor, may we mark this as State exhibit number 27? Is this the material you told me about? Yes, Your Honor. Mr. Cotham, you are aware of this document? Mr. Bordeaux, I show you an insurance policy taken out on your wife, Mrs. Sue Lynn Hatcher Bordeaux by the Wayfair Insurance Company with a face value of $100,000. I'm aware of that. You took it out on your wife. Yeah, well, sir, I did. We were traveling by plane so much, you know, campaigning... And you are aware that it has a double indemnity clause paying $200,000 to the beneficiary in the event of the insured's accidental death? No, I was not aware of that. Who's the beneficiary? I am. Well, then had your wife's death been ruled accidental, you would have pocketed a quick and easy 200 grand. Not a small sum for a politician in need of campaign fund. Look, I don't need any $200,000! My family has... Go ahead, finish it. Your family has? Your family has? My family has money. Yes, they do. But $200,000 wouldn't hurt if a man, a politically ambitious rich man needed a slush fund to pay off an alleged blackmailer, would it? Objection, Your Honor! The jury will disregard the last question. You know better than that, Mr. Wrench. I'm sorry, Your Honor. It just... It slipped out. I... Oh, that's all, Mr. Bordeaux. Uh... Come in. Come in, please. Thank you for receiving me so late, Mr. Wrench. No. No, it's all right. Listen. I'm sorry the place is such a mess. I just haven't had time. Just sit down right over here. I was just trying to get a present for my daughter. It's her birthday... Sit down, please. This is not an impulsive act. I wouldn't come in running over here in the middle of the night. I'm on a mission of madness. I see that. I want you to know who really killed my daughter-in-law. And who might that be? I did. Randy had nothing to do with it. Well, it doesn't surprise me that you would try anything to save your son. Don't be condescending, Wrench. This is difficult enough to confess. I wouldn't think of it. Go on. That day, um, I heard Randy and Sue Lynn from my room. They were quarreling about the blackmailer's latest demands, $25,000. And naturally, I saw the potential for scandal. And, um... Well, during the hunt, the dove hunt, I ran into Sue Lynn in the woods and, uh, we had angry words, and... Uh, I really thought she was gonna shoot me. I mean, she was drunk. The autopsy already show that. And, uh, it just all happened so quickly. I mean, I... I grabbed the rifle from her, and I had my hands on the barrel. And it just went off. And then, uh, I saw her head in the blood and everything. And so, I ran away. And I tried to convince myself that it was, um, an accident. Accident? Her death was about as accidental as Pearl Harbor. Now, you best go home where you belong. Wait a minute. Did you hear what I said? Do you think I could make all that up? Well... You make a mighty fine living out of stories. Why don't you print it in the paper? What if I'm telling you the truth? What if you have the wrong person on trial? I mean, what if... What if jackasses fly? Now, if I thought I was prosecuting the wrong person, I'd resign tomorrow and cut weed. What can I do to make you believe me? Ms. Bordeaux, nobody is going to believe... If what you say is true, then why weren't your fingerprints on the rifle. I was wearing gloves that day. And why were Randy's everywhere? Because it's his rifle! Exactly! It's his rifle, it's his wife, and we know his motivation. And you have none. What? You are another mother trying to save her son. I can appreciate that. But it's late now, and I have been very patient. I have a great many... Damn it, Wrench, listen to me. I am not without power. And someday, you may need me. Well... I'll overlook that. Listen, you're talking bribe, and then, we might have another case to try. Now, let's say good night. Enough lives have already been wasted. Mr. Deacon. When defendant Randy Bordeaux telephoned you, what did he say? Well, uh... Best I can recollect, he wanted to hire me to find somebody supposedly blackmailing his wife. Did he say who that was? No, sir. In fact, he didn't make much sense. He was yelling and cussing, and... He was so riled up, I could barely make out what he really wanted. He kept talking about his problem and how he had to get rid of it. What was his problem? His wife. I think he wanted someone to kill her. "Vengeance is mine," said the Lord. Now, Randall Bordeaux... Randall Bordeaux decided to play God. He tried Sue Lynn, in his own private court, where he was both accuser and prosecutor, judge and jury, and he found her guilty. And he sentenced her to death with a shotgun, from a distance of less than five feet. He carried that sentence out. Now, I don't want vengeance. I don't even want an eye for an eye, or a tooth for a tooth. What I want you to do... What I want you to do is something very easy, something very simple. All I want you to do is dispense justice. Justice. Magnificent, majestic, wonderful American justice. Somebody... Somebody wrote about it once, about a year or two ago. I'm... I'm gonna read to you what somebody wrote about it. Then I'm gonna go sit down. I got it right over here. "We're shocked by the blood that spills in our cities. "We are stunned by too many verdicts "that send violent men back into the streets they stained. "Not only here, not only in the state of Texas, but in the capital of our country. "Punishments have been lenient, lapse, often nothing at all. "Power and influence "must not be a reason to deny justice. "Unless all men are equal in the eyes of the law, "in the courts, in the juries, "then our house folds, and darkness will come." The author of these inspiring words... I mean, someone who says it far better than I... Thank you, ma'am. Thank you for making my case. Callie Lord Bordeaux. The jury is still out in the Randy Bordeaux murder trial. Nine men and three women have been deliberating 64 hours. And the feeling is, they may be hopelessly dead-locked. Turn it off. This is Susan Moore, Channel 9. Now that's a good sign, Callie. With them being out 64 hours... Well, that means the jury's fixing to vote an acquittal. No need to grease the skid, Jeannie. You know something? Sledge ought to prosecute Clyde Deacon for perjury. They have to free him. Oh, honey, they will. There is some justice left in this cracked, old world of ours. He shouldn't even be on trial. I know, Callie. I know. Jeannie, it's burning a hole in me, and I can't get it out. I tried to talk... Hon. Hon, I know. And I'm here. You don't know. I don't know what, Callie? I never thought it would go this far. Mr. Bordeaux, would you please rise? "We, the jury, find the defendant, Randall Bordeaux III, "guilty of the charge of first degree murder." Your Honor, we demand that the jury be polled! Mama! There's been a mistake. There's been a mistake! You can't take him! No. No, no, don't touch him! Don't touch him, please. He's mine! Mama! He's mine! Mama! Let him go, please! It's not his fault! Don't take my baby! What time is it? Um, just a little bit after 2:00. I'll fix you some tea, okay? Mmm. I'm gonna call Austin again. He never called me back. I'm sorry, Callie. I can't do it. I've searched my soul. My prayers are with you. And Randy. Mrs. Bordeaux, the President has asked me to extend his respects to you. But, uh, there's nothing he can do. It's a matter for the State of Texas. Hon... It's his decision. He won't sign another appeal. It's dragged on long enough. He wants the sentence carried out. God, no. We can delay this indefinitely. Yes. And that's just what Randy doesn't want. He's quite a man, you know that? It takes a whole lot more courage to die than just go on living on the installment plan. I'm going to... Callie. What? He asked me to tell you, "Don't." What? He said, "Don't." I'll be downstairs. No! No! My baby! There have been 361 executions in Texas since 1924. Electric chairs are no longer used. 5:00 p.m. on the day before the execution, a prisoner is served the last meal of his choice. He then showers and dresses in the clothes he'll be buried in. Assistant Warden reads court order requiring execution before sunrise. The prisoner is taken to a hospital room where a certified medical doctor will insert an intravenous tube. Enough Sodium Pentothal is dripped into the tube to cause instantaneous death. I wish you hadn't come. I know. I had to know, are you all right? I'm fine. Just fine. Except, they took my guitar away. Afraid I might hang myself with a string. Randy... Sit down, Mama. Sit down. Listen to me. Cotham is in Washington. He seems to think that he might grant us a stay. There's a thousand things we can do. I'll pass. I'm ready today. I might not be, 60 days from now. Please. We haven't begun to exhaust the possibilities. The best I could hope for would be commutation to life. Look around. I think I'd rather take my chances on the other side. I've always tried to do what I thought was best for you. Mama, I know that. I know that. Now cheer up. The world knows I walked by. I had a good run. Irony is, there's a lot of people I'd like to kill. I'm getting popped off for someone I didn't. Someone I loved. I can't let this happen without telling you something. Hush. Hush, now. I know. I know... You know what? I do know, Mama. I guess I've always known. What? Oh, my God. No... Do you hate me? It's too late for that. It's Liberation Day for both of us. Forgive me. Forgive me, please. Of course... Of course, I do. Of course. Do you love me? Please love me. Mama. I love you. I have always loved you. Oh, baby... Sure you all can handle him from here? Oh, I hope so. Thank you very much. Now, you folks have a happy life. I hope we will. Thank you. Here. He's all yours. Fine boy. 100% perfect. We watched Callie and son drive away. When the limo was just a little blackened speck, Jeannie whispered, "Maybe she'll do better this time." And I said, "We'll see, hon. "We'll see."
