I'll get it, I promise. So this is the infamous Cobra Lane, huh? This is where the races took place. Yeah, of course it took a homicide to do that. What'd you find? This whole lane's owned by Chinese triads. It's private property, almost a mile of docking warehouses, just for produce. Clearly. Yeah, we're interviewing the viewers. The company's been stripped down. That's why the case will go nowhere. It's personal. Just following protocol, Captain. This Shen. Yeah. You sure? Thank you. You will be avenged. I guarantee it. Tell Mom and Dad hi for me. Excuse me, my name is Shen, Shen Long. I came to inquire about the death of my brother. It was a motorcycle accident and homicide. You got a case number, location, date of incident, name of individuals involved in the incident? I don't have a case number. I'm just hoping to get some some details of what happened. I can't help you then. Sergeant, please. Sergeant! Captain, Captain! What do you want, kid? I need to know what happened to my brother Tien Long. Hell. Please. Let's make it quick. That's all we have. That's it? Tell me you have something else. Where did you say you're from again? I came from California. Long ways. Is that where you said your brother was from? Yeah. No, no, we grew up here. Ended up moving there because I had a job. What... You said it was a motorcycle gang? One of them. Which one? Where are they? Look, these motorcycle gangs, they basically do what the fuck they wanna do. Gangs, triads, God knows what else. If you think it's hard catching one gangster, try catching one going 200 miles an hour. This gang got a name, is it local, what? Why haven't you arrested anybody? We found his body in a strip. It's owned by local businesses. Until it was a homicide, there was nothing we could do. Yeah. Yeah. Where is this place? You come off as the reckless type, looking to go in there guns blazing. Well, you know what? Somebody's gotta pay for his death. And let me guess, you're gonna be the one who makes them pay. Well, who else is gonna do it? You found anything, huh, made any progress, huh? We can't discuss anything that's an ongoing investigation. I just need a fucking name! Okay? Just give me a name! Listen! I understand emotions are running high... No shit it's running high! I understand, I get it. Do you understand how I feel? We'll give you a call if we find out anything. I know exactly what that means. Good day, Captain. Should've known you'd still have my keys after all these years. Hey, Pops. Good to see you, son. Thanks for taking care of the funeral. Hey, hey, hey, don't even think about it. I made plenty of money off of you back in the day. Yeah. Yeah, your opponents, they could never figure you out. Your speed, you're different in every round, changing up your pace, your style. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, those were the days, huh? Those were the days. You know, I keep thinking maybe if I spent less time fighting, more time with Tien, maybe he'd still be here... Don't do that to yourself. Your brother got himself involved in that underground world. I feel guilty, too. I didn't know about it. If I did, maybe there was something we could've done, but we couldn't, and here we are. Yeah, here we are. Well, let me tell you something, if I ever find this guy... Hey, don't start thinking like that. You're gonna get yourself in a lot of trouble. I don't wanna argue about this. - Your brother got... - Someone has to pay for what they did to Tien. Your brother knew what he was doing when he got himself involved in that... You don't get it! It wasn't an accident. They killed my brother in cold blood. They killed my family. And what do you plan on doing about it? As a matter of fact, a lot. And I'll do it by myself, if I have to, if no one else is gonna help me. Midnight Squad. What? Midnight Squad, it's an elite underground racing team. Bunch of thugs. Famous around here for a dangerous combination of high speed racing and crazy riding styles. You're looking for a man named Cobra. Did you see Tien's body? Yeah. What did they do? You don't wanna know. If this city has to burn, then so be it. I haven't been practicing. You younger generations, you need to keep the traditions alive. Even though we live in America, we must not forget our roots. Yes. Good. How was California? It was peaceful. I had to come back, though. I think you know why. We know about Tien. I'm assuming that's why you're here. Mm. How'd it happen? Word on the street is that he got involved in underground street racing. Deals went sour, things went south. Midnight Squad, right? I heard, too. You guys know anything else? Shen, I understand, you are feeling - very emotional now... - Emotional. People keep on saying that word, all right? The fact is, you're supposed to take care of my little brother. The Ang Soon Tiong Benevolent Association has no such dealings in such matters. We are merely here to provide essential services for the community. I used to work for you, so I know you have your fingers in everything that's illegal, okay? My question is, do you have a finger in this? Do you? Our condolences for your family, for your loss. You answer me! You answer me. We understand he was the last of your family. Come, light a candle for Tien. Family. You people know nothing about family. Welcome to the land of glamours, glories, dangers, high speed, of angels, and beasts. A man walks into a club, wants to turn the heat up. Tell me, stranger, do you bring me sake, gifts, cash, or danger? I'm just looking for some information. Mm, mm, mm, don't look like no cop. No, no, my name's Shen, Shen Long. Shen Long. Chinese dragon. But when the dragon walks into my land, he becomes the creation of my hand. And your name? My name is Goddess Lucy, the spirit of fire, passion, and love. She dances with her magic steps, she races with her dangerous stares. Unless you want to die in the burning flame. I got you. Okay. Look, which group is Midnight Squad? What, are you crazy? - These guys are packing. - No, I wanna talk to them. You go within 10 feet of them, your ass will get dropped. The name of the game is race between here and the miles' wide space, whatever the problems you have boiling, solved here or try dying. How do we do that? Just get on a bike, take the throttle, or go on a hike. And where do I get a bike? Find Dean. I'm sorry? Find Dean. Dean. What you want? Someone sent me. It's fucking three AM. Looking for a bike. It's the only one I've got. That's a bike? Yeah. Does it move? Look, it's specifically prepped for modifications. I don't do that cookie cutter bullshit. She'll be anything you want her to be. I need her to be fast. Well, that depends how good you are. What mods? All right, look, look, look, I'll tell you what, you do your own modifications. If you buy her tonight, I'll throw in some gear for you. But you can't be driving out of here looking like a squid. Besides, if you hit the pavement looking like that, you're sushi, my friend. I'm not Japanese. Not Japanese. A little boy left with a plan returns with a bike! Becomes a man. What do you guys think? Proud of me? - Yes. - Not bad, huh? This boy bad, huh? Come riding up on here on a stock bike. We call this a tin can over here. This ain't nothing until you work on it. What? What do I do? Look, you can do a 520 conversion chain, replace the suspension components, drop it so it gets more traction, right? Look, look, drop it so it gets more traction, extend the swing arms, get some new wheels. If you can't do that, you might wanna get a new life. - Right? - Yes! Okay. After that, when can I race? You gotta be initiated in the club, man. What does it take to be initiated... Shh. Here, here, here, here, here, here. You're so nervous. Come with me. Smack talk and hustle. You need the bets and the muscles. If you can't hold the heat, shouldn't be on the seat. All right. Wanna fight, I'll fight, bring it on. Clear the ring, this boy wants his colors! All right, asian baby boy. See if you don't hit like a bitch. It's time to paint him with my favorite colors! Ooh, yeah! Yeah, get him! Go, go! That's how we do it in the streets! Let's go. Get up. Come on, runt. Come on. Go, go! Oh! Smoked. Yeah, what! Ladies and gentlemen, I think I found a new toy. You did. Look at me, that was a good adjustment. Where'd you learn how to fight like that? On the streets. Well, he earned his colors, right? All you need is a tag now. The dude in the game. Ghost. - No, no, no, no. - Look for the classified ads. Look for the fake. You'll find where we will be. Bring your bike, bring your cash. I love man make me cash. Fight like cat with wild punch. Ooh! You done messed up now, boy. You in. Don't forget to get your bike modded. Wait, modded? Where do I do that? Look up Andromeda. Tek. It's all good, man, it's all good. Yeah. All right, new guy. Andromeda. Tek. Hello? Andromeda? I don't go by that name anymore. What do you want? I need a tune-up. Where's your bike? Outside. Well, bring it in then. I hate the sun. A stock bike? Yeah, how much is it gonna cost? I need to get it drag race ready. Well, you're gonna need a lot of work. I can do whatever your budget calls for. Who you gonna race, anyways? Cobra of Midnight Squad. Well, you can dream on. Yeah, you're gonna take down Cobra's bike, right on. Just remember, Cobra doesn't race amateurs. I'm told you can help. Is that not true? Oh, I know Cobra's bike, yeah. It's just gonna take a lot to get this into shape. Right. You were part of the Midnight Squad, huh? What was that like? Yeah, I used to be one of them, but I learned how to keep my mouth shut about their operations and code. How do you think I'm still alive today? Is that what killed my brother? Don't drag me into this. I got nothing to do with it. Then get my bike in shape for the race. 60. Hundred? Thousand. What? Well, Cobra's bike alone is worth over 100 grand, and if all you wanna do is race, I can do the minimum to keep up with his bike, and the rest is all on you. Why so expensive? You gotta do the basics. Extend the swing arms and drop the bike. What do those do? Extending your swing arms minimize your chance of doing a wheelie. You want all your wheels on the ground. The first 60 feet on takeoff are the most crucial ones. The goal is to get this 450-pound bike moving forward as quickly as possible. You need a fuel system for quicker throttle response. Your suspension needs to be lowered for hunkered down traction, enhancing stance. And now, oh yeah, we need to get you an air shifter kit. Cut out your left turn signal switch and turn it into a button that transmits a signal to a solenoid. Solenoid? Yeah, it kills engine ignition. It fires 120 psi of compressed air to kick the transmission to the next gear. Right. Why wouldn't I know that? Yeah, and that's just the basics. So, if you ever wanted to impress Cobra, by the way, keep in mind that he doesn't race for less than 50 grand, so you better have the greens. If you wanna race him. Yeah, let's do it. Half up front. I'll have the rest by tomorrow. That will just get your bike stripped down. Well then, you have my word. You're not here by tomorrow night, I'm selling your bike in parts. He was there again last night. What was he doing there? Word on the street is he wants a race with Cobra. Even got himself a new bike. He must be insane. Still trying to find out who killed Tien, is he? He took an initiation rite. Beat the guy to a pulp before the cops could come. I remember. Where did he train, with Manny? Shen is not going to stop at this. Perhaps it's time we give him a little warning. Leave it to me. How many of our guys can I take? Just take two. I don't want to alarm him or the rival gangs that something is on. They're just waiting for us to be distracted. I know where to find him. Go, take care of it. Hello? Cynthia, it's Shen. Jesus, Shen, it's one AM. This about work? Yeah, I wanna talk about selling my house. Just call me tomorrow- No, no, no, no, it's urgent. That can wait tomorrow. Cynthia, I need cash like right now, like fast. You don't sell a house overnight, Shen. You know that. What if I'm asking for 150K? I just need it in cash. Shen, your house is at least 320. I know. But whoever wants it right now, 150K. I just need it by noon tomorrow. Please. Who has that kind of cash laying around? Don't you? Those are deposits and company assets, Shen. I can't. Well, if you buy it, then that's a kind of profit you're never gonna see again. This is what you've been waiting for, right? I will wire the money tomorrow. All right, I'm sending you the wire info right now. And Shen? Yeah? You're not getting into any problems, are you? Dangerous shit? Hey, I got you the money. I know. I already placed the orders for some parts. Gonna be working on your exhaust first while I'm waiting. How long is it gonna take? My, my, you're an impatient one, now, aren't you? Look, half of the race is how good the bike is. Now, the other half is how good the rider is. Do you even have the skills to beat Cobra? I ain't got no choice. For some vendetta, right? They killed my brother, so, yeah, you got it right. Yeah, I remember. Typical. And I'm not surprised. It's all fun and games for you, huh? Tell me, are they part of the triads? Look, I already told you, I like staying alive, so you're getting nothing out of me. Whatever it takes. How bad do you wanna beat him? With everything I got. All right, well then go out and get yourself a Inca 500. They're less menacing machines. Come back, and I'll show you a thing or two. And get one for three grand. That'll be like your kiddie training wheels. Are you saying you're helping me? Oh, if that'll mean an extra five grand, yeah, yeah. You don't come cheap, do you? Gotta pay the bills, boy! Thank you, Andromeda. I really need it. It's Tek. Don't call me Andromeda. If you say so. Sir, I wasn't expecting you today. Please, step inside. The captain has not left yet. Mr. Chang. How are you, Doug? Same shit, different day. I am here on concern of a matter. You must've heard about Shen Long? Seems he is making some noise on the streets. He actually stopped by the precinct. Stopped here? Yeah, he asked about his brother. Well, we both know he's deceased. Unfortunate situation. And what did you say to him? I told him to get the fuck out of here. Ah, no wonder he's causing problems, making it his mission to take on the Midnight Squad. We'll see. Doug, you know I can't have that. The races are very important for business. Technically, I can't stop him. He hasn't broken any laws. The races are key to cleaning the money. I know this, Mr. Chang. Shen Long's little vendetta is going to draw too much attention. Secrecy is of the utmost importance. So what do you want me to do? Well, we are going to teach him a little lesson. I just need for you to make sure your men do not interfere. My men are pretty busy. Good. Gym's closed right now. You guys look familiar. We haven't met. But you might've seen me with Lucid Lucy and the boys. That's right. There were a lot of people there. Doesn't look like you guys are gonna train. No, just a chat. How friendly it is, well, that depends on you. I see Chang sent his lapdog. That is how the triads work, right? Now, Shen, we are a benevolent society. You know we don't like to be called that. I should know that. I grew up with them before you were even born. Go home, Shen. We don't need you causing trouble here. You see, I can't do that. Hell, I have no home to go to. Well, we don't like causing trouble. But you, you're a bull in a china shop. Then give me the man who killed my brother. Which I know you can. Well, you know we had nothing to do with that. Like I already said, how friendly this chat is, it's up to you. Let's get a little bit friendlier then. Go home. You can't stop, can you? You're just like your brother. How could you let Shen embarrass us like this? I was holding back. I would have killed him if you'd let me. Let me take the guns and... Guns? Huh, what are you gonna do? Wake up the whole city? Shen's only advantage is that he won't stop until he's dead. The Captain has already done us a huge favor by turning his head. You use guns, wake the city up, not even he can help us. Then give me more men. The thing about Shen is we can't threaten him with anything. He's got no family, he's got nothing. He can't be reasoned with, he can't be blackmailed. He's got nothing. Except for his revenge on Cobra. Strange, his bike wasn't with him or parked anywhere. Precisely. It's precious to him. Have some our boys keep an eye out for it. Yes, destroy it. He will never ride again. Bring me his fingers, all of them. Hey, boy, bike's ready. - You look like shit. - I feel like a truck hit me. Usually bikers say that when they have their bike. Let's see it. Whazzup? Woo! Bam. Looks the same. Never let someone know how powerful your bike really is. Here's your custom clutch mod here. I disabled the back-torque limiting slipper assembly. What's that? All right, try to launch from a dead stop and your bike will go into a hammering effect. Putting so much level pressure will just make it go pah! Sweet. The more money I spend on it, the more dangerous it is, huh? That's what it feels like. Yeah, well, racing ain't for the weak. Got the dog bones to handle the chores in the rear of the bike. Yep, I lowered it. General rule is one-tenth per second decrease in the quarter mile is possible for each inch that the bike is lowered. Can I even ride this thing normally anymore? Just watch out for the road speed bumps, all right? And, by the way, a slammed bike is much better than the ones up in the air, right? True story. There you go. You're gonna fly to Neverland with this sucker. Yeah. You ready? Come on, hop on. Feels good. Seriously, what did you do? - Hmm? - Nothing. - Nothing. - I'm good. I got in a fight, but it'll heal. - It's just a bruise. - Yeah, what is that? - Back to this. - Oh, wow. Bruises don't bleed, so. - Yeah. - Yeah. - I'll be okay. - Mm hmm. That is the worst stitch I have ever seen. Thank you. I hope Mr. Chang knows you're here. Hey, Manny. We're here looking for Shen. He's not here. Then I guess you won't mind if we take a look around now, will you? Mr. Chang and I have an understanding. We go way back. We have a gentleman's agreement. The Dragon Head gave me specific orders to look for Shen. Now, excuse me, while I do what I'm told. He knows I'm good for my word. Then tell us where he is. Didn't Mr. Chang ever teach you guys how to respect your elders? Do you know who I am? I don't really give a shit who you are. You're getting old, Manny. Oh yeah. Stay down. The Dragon Head will hear about this. I don't think so. If he finds out you guys are here messing up shit, you're the ones who are gonna be punished. Fine, nothing happened. It's like we were never here! Go home. You punks act like you own the world, you've never even seen it. You have to start from the smallest edge of the wound so it can slowly close up. Diagonal path across here. There. Thank you. How did you get it from, anyways? A fight. You got it at the Sprints? The Sprints? Yeah, where the drag races are. No, no, no. A feud with the triads. Probably Cobra. Well, I could've told you that. - There, tight as a virgin! - Oh, fuck. You know, I used to grow up in that world. It's crazy, now I'm gonna take them down. That's impossible, and you know that. Well, I'm gonna try, anyways. Hey, you didn't get the training bike, did you? Oh, since you're always ready to jump into the heat of things, what's say you try your baby out, huh? Hmm? All right, the basic theory, clutch, throttle, shifter, then brakes. Gotta burnout. Okay. Whats' a burnout? A burnout is when your bike tires dig deep into the road for a maximum traction. But remember the first 60 feet rule. That's where you want to lead. Oh, God, keep the front brake on, and rev the engine. Okay. Slip the clutch. All right, rock the bike back and forth. Spread it through the tires, go on. Keep the RPM between 4,500 and 5,500. Good, all right. Go ahead, try a launch, go. The fuck? I can't even get to second gear. Nope, the bike picks up too fast before your legs can even go to the shifter. Try air shift. - What, what? - Oh my God. The left turn signal, dumbass. - Left turn? - Yep. Yep, that button is now your shifter to change gears. What about signaling? Are you serious? You're drag racing, not turning left to grandma's house. Now go ahead, go, try again. Yep. Woo hoo! What'd you think? Woo, I feel lightheaded. Yep, that's what pulling two Gs feels like. It's insane how fast it is. I'm fighting to keep it under control the whole time. Right, number one reason to lose. Come on. Never fight with the bike. You have to control it with grace and precision. Doesn't take much to get it going, but the more you fight it, the more the bike will win. You have to be zen, okay? Unlike your character. Here. Zen, okay. Zen. - Zen, okay. - Zen, Zen. God, give it to me. - There you go. - Okay, just relax, - don't fight the bike. - Yep. And one more thing, you gotta lock this thing up real good. Hmm. That's the thing. I don't have a garage. Well, you can't leave it outside. Someone comes in, touches it, and it's game over for you. And don't tell anyone what this bike really is. Your competitive advantage is when your opponent underestimates you, got it? Can I leave it with you? Sure, 100 bucks a day. You don't quit, do you? How long you been doing this? Since I was 15. Impressive. Hey, you got a handle? All drag racers have a handle. You can't be using your real name. It's a highly secretive club. I noticed. You were ousted from it, right? Yeah. Well, it's harder for females to race at the Sprints, especially when I was winning. When they found out who I was as a person, I pretty much became a. Got arrested real quickly. Damn. Well, when money's at stake, people will resort to all kinds of dirty means to get you ousted. That's why you need a handle. Yeah. It's Ghost. Shit. What happened? What the hell do you think happened? The triad paid me a little visit. Sorry, Pops. Yeah, you're sorry. Didn't I tell you to stay the hell away from them? They came at me, what was I supposed to do? Yeah, yeah, yeah, what are you supposed to do? They're involved in the races, Manny. No shit they're involved in the races. The triad, the mafia, the yakuza. Anywhere there's money, those assholes got their hands in it... Yeah, I don't care about anybody. I want Cobra, that's it. I told you, kid, keep your fight in the ring. You know what my ring is? Five to 10 seconds of a quarter mile in a drag race. That's the only time Cobra's alone. None of his goons, just me and him. That's the ring! That's where I'll get my revenge! That's when I'll kill him. You'll kill him? Do you hear yourself? You're talking about taking someone's life. Well, revenge knows no other solutions, am I right? Yeah, revenge and retribution is an... Spare me the cliche. I already made up my mind, and you can't stop me. No, I can't stop you, but I can tell you this. You go back to the triad, don't you ever come back here. All the work I put in. Getting you out of the triad to begin with, put you in that ring. You became something. Got rid of all that anger. You go back to the triad now, I'm sorry, kid, don't ever come back here. I'm not gonna go through this again. Pops, I'm not asking for permission. This garage isn't open 24 hours, you know? Got a race. Still using the same fake ads as announcements. I can't believe they haven't been caught yet. Idiots. It's my chance to prove myself. Don't over-rev. The bike's powerful. Keep both wheels on the ground. And remember, take the fight out of you. Don't fight the bike. Okay, zen. - Yep, Zen. - Zen. Little boy comes home with his new toy. Who is he racing? Who is he going to destroy? Two Gs to go. All right, he has two thousand. Do it? And you? All right. - Let's do it. - You're gonna do it? You good? It's a race. You better not spray me. We ain't using nitrous for this race. What are the terms? Two, and a break for you. What, what's that? You're about 40 pounds lighter than Apex. He gets a break. You're gonna start two bike lengths back, all right? The road is clear. Let's roll. Woo! My sexy beasts, are you ready? We might never see each other on this side. Let's have some wild fun on a wild fight! Show me your hands! Go! Not bad for your first time. Here's your cut. You think Cobra saw that? Shit, it's Viper. Viper, Viper! Who's going to pee in the diaper. Not bad, kid. How about taking on a real rider? 30 Gs. Nice, nice, nice, nice. Second ride, you already with the Midnight Squad? 30 Gs, can you cough it up? 80 Gs, and I want Cobra. 80 Gs? You want Cobra? Game on! Let's get ready. What the hell are you doing? Giving him easy money. No, you're gonna fucking lose. Look, Cobra runs a 7.9. You're half a second behind. So be it. The little monkey is taking on a snake. Yeah. I got him now. He got you, too, baby. Just be very careful. That's going to be the easiest 80 grand he's gonna make. If he finishes. I like your guts. Luck might be on your side if you hold the bike real tight. My toy's going to set up the race. Make sure you show your face. How'd it go? Here's one G, your side of the deal. How did she do? Pure power. All right. Clutch is a little loose. I'll get the compressed air filled up. Were you double-footing it? Hmm? I hit the shifters at every 47 hundred, and changing at each red line. Don't look at the tach. You should just be able to hear it. Use your ears for shift times. Eyes straight. The tires still look pretty good. Spend a little more time in the burnout. I think you can afford to get more traction. Listen, I want a new set of tires. I want the absolute best. I have a race with Cobra. What? Yep, he agreed to the terms. 80 Gs. Now where'd you get that kind of money. Can you believe that's all I got? Yeah, and you're gonna lose it all, and you know it. Listen to me, Cobra's souped-up Busa - is enough to destroy... - I know! You don't have to tell me, okay? I know what I'm doing. Your funeral. It'll be his. Cut the engines, boys. You don't wanna wake up the whole neighborhood. What is this? Oh, it's you, Apex. See you changed the bike. Finally. You, you are the one modding his bike? Yeah. And what's it to you? I came here for my money. Your boy cheated and spit nitro to win! It's cold, he didn't use it. That is bullshit! I cannot be beaten! You lost, buddy! I won fair and square. Break it down then, prove it! I ain't breaking down shit - I am not dismantling shit this late at night. So go home, Apex. Besides, you know that the CBR mods won't spit against the ZX-10R. Boring. Get the fuck in there you motherfucker. Kill that son-of-a-bitch. Kill that motherfucker. Ouch, for real. I know where he keeps his bike. Mechanic's garage off 2nd Street. We'll come back tomorrow with the boys. You better learn to watch your back, monkey boy. As soon as I get out of here, I got my eyes on you. Hey, Shen Long, grab your stuff. Someone posted your bail. Didn't know you smoked. You don't know a lot of things about me. Thanks for the bail. It was your money, the one G you gave me. I'll get it back to you. I know, I figured you were good for your word. Look, Lucid Lucy called. What, when? I picked up, figured it was a phone call you didn't wanna miss. Two days from now, in between the Oak Street and Marina Lane at the docks. The locals call it Cobra Lane. That's where he lives. That's Midnight Squad for you, private property, racing between two police jurisdictions. Yeah, that's how they avoid being stopped by cops. You gotta get ready for this. You have to know everything about Cobra's bike. I already do. Damn. Someone's obsessive. I gotta know everything about him. Yeah. Hey, you got any beer? It's 9 AM. Yeah, it's midnight in China. Oh my God! I could sleep forever like this. - No, no, you gotta stay with me. - Mm hm. Cobra's bike, let me see if I got this right, it's a four-stroke transverse engine, 13 hundred CC with liquid cooling system, and Mikuni-Denso fuel injection. Eh, that's just the base model. Midnight Squad allow nitrous in their races, so add another 100 BHP to it and in Cobra's turbo charger, forced induction combustion, and you can add another 600 BHP to it. I could've just asked you. Where's that put him? Above your class. Okay, it's fixable. Any other modifications you know about? Only when I was a member. He could've changed it, upgraded it. Please, come on, please, wake up, wake up. - What? - Okay, okay. What do we know for sure? What do we know for sure, please. Stay with me. His stock engine's replaced with bigger blocks and custom crankshafts, which makes his stroke increase horsepower. Triple trees are constructed of lead to hold down the front ends. His battery's moved to the front faring. Swing arms extended way. Okay. I don't know any of that. You're the professional. Just tell me what I need to do to get on par with his bike. Don't forget about the fuel mix. Yep, he mixes his fuel with the VBC 45 petrol. That alone is over 200 bucks a gallon. What his actual fuel is, only he knows. And he changes as he experiments, so. Obviously. That's a lot of stuff. Mhmm. Yeah, well, it's gotta be in your blood. Master Chang wanted you to have this. It's the location of the next race. I'm sure you already know Shen. Included in there is all the information pertaining to evidence if you want him arrested. Tell Master Chang I appreciate his efforts. Oh, by the way, your men might be getting a call from Andromeda, Tek's workshop, you know the place. - You know the place. - What about it? Let's just say Shen isn't going to be racing if he doesn't have a bike. His bike is at Tek's garage? Not for long. I'll handle the bike, you take the man. What the hell? - I closed it. - Wait here. Shut up! Come on, come over here. Go ahead, let's see if you're faster than a bullet. What do the triads want, huh, you want money? We already said! Get out of this town! I will, tomorrow. You're not going to the races, either! No, no, don't do it! Don't fucking do it! Next time, it's gonna be your fingers, too. You okay? Is it over? Can you repair it? I'm sorry. It can't be over. Ghost, Ghost, what the hell? I just heard the race was off. Talk to me, man. You cannot do this, especially with the Midnight Squad. How am I gonna explain this to Lucid Lucy, huh? - It's over. - Ghost, what? - Yeah. - What the fuck? What's going on, man? Is this some triad shit? They came over here and told me that shit, dog, like they was threatening me in my own home or something. I don't fucking play with that - kind of shit. - Sorry, I can't talk right now So is it true, is the race really off? - What the fuck? - No. No, it's not. Hold up, who am I talking to? It's Andromeda, Kannibal. The race is happening. You have my word. Hold up, Andromeda Andromeda? Look, your word is good, I'm gonna let Lucid Lucy know, and whatever the fuck y'all smoking on, bring some of that shit tomorrow night. I will see you there, on time. Oh, you will. Thought you said it couldn't be repaired. No, it can't. Careful, come. This is where I keep all my forgotten memories. What's that? This is 115 pounds of torque, redlines at 12,500 RPMs. 310 horsepower peak. This is the EXSR-1000, not street legal. I couldn't take it outside without getting arrested. Sounds fast. If you don't think it's fast enough then I don't think you understand what an unprovoked 170 miles per hour wheelie means in terms of physics. Is that the bike you won with? Yeah. I mean, I preferred the ES-14R for its longer body, obviously. But there's something about this bike that just speaks to me. I named it Havoc. Very suiting. You can race with her. No. Well, she hasn't seen any action for a very long time. I think she wouldn't mind to go for a round one last time. No, you don't get it. It's the triads, they will come for you. And I'll be gone. I hate this town, anyways. I'd rather go somewhere where nobody knows me. Go ahead. You've come back. She's beautiful. Yeah. You can have my winnings. You can have anything. Look, even with this super bike, and, trust me, I think she's much better than the Busa, you're not skilled enough to beat Cobra. You never know, there might not be a winner. What are you gonna do? A quarter mile, a thousand feet, that's when I'll get my revenge, when he's all alone. What, are you gonna kick the bike down? I'm gonna kill him the way he killed my brother. Tien. What are you doing here? Well, I can ask you the same question. This is an active crime scene. You know about the races, don't you? Is this still about Tien, again? Look, I'm not saying your department's incompetent, but this revenge, this is personal - Stop. If we were able to catch them in our cars, even if we were able to catch them in our cars, they'd get what, 90 days, $1,000 fine. But then what? We're right back to square one. If it's so inconsequential, let me have my revenge. See, what I'm more concerned about is you breaking the law. Captain, I'm just here to show him he's not the best. That's all. He can't get away with anything. So you mean to tell me that this punk ass race is what got you all excited? Why don't you have your revenge. But after that, I don't wanna see you again. Thank you, Captain. So long as no laws are broken, do what you gotta do. Ready for tonight? Yeah, I guess so. I got Havoc tuned up, ready to go. Nitrous filled, all air compressor levels checked. Pretty crazy, huh? Just a week ago, this city was a stranger to me. You're still a stranger to this city. Easy there, cowboy! You're gonna need all your reflexes. - I'm good. - Mm hmm. I've got six hours to get it out of my system. I was on par with Cobra. Some say I was even better than him. I didn't think I was. I definitely knew my way through a bike better than he does. He had the cash, I had the hands. So nobody's seen Cobra? No. The level of secrecy is part of our code. Nobody knows anybody. We arrived to the Sprints in full gear. Only go by our handles. And rule number one, never take off your helmet. How were you ousted? The guy I was dating. He knew I was going to the Sprints, so he put two and two together. I mean, there's not that many female racers, so, and me being a high profile at the time, I guess it was just a matter of time before he got bitter. After the breakup, he ousted me. Damn, that is bitter. Yeah. Eh, it was time to retire, anyways. Retire? You don't look a day past 30. Thanks. Bu you know when your reflexes are even a millisecond off, just all downhill from there. Hey, thank you. Everything you did. Save it, kiddo. Just take the compliment. You know 60 grand is more than enough to say thank you. Always about money, huh? Gotta pay the bills. All right, well, I'll see you around. Wow, wow, wow. This is Andromeda's bike. Sure is. I never thought I'd see you at the Sprints again. Here he comes. Welcome, my sexy beast, to the hottest Goddess Lucy race! I'm so excited to watch you crash and die. Same rules. Under the Midnight Squad, nitrous is allowed. Nobody wait handicaps in the race. If you crash, you're on your own. If you both crash, no one comes to you or to your funeral! Everybody splits as if this race never happened. Tell me, if every rider understands the rules of the Sprints. Terrific! Let's lock the money. Drivers, are you ready? Go! What the hell's going on? No! No you don't! Wake up so I can kill you! Get up, get up! What do you mean nobody's there? Where are they now? Hey, you know the rules. No interference. Back off Lucy. We just need to find Cobra. You know my rules. You know my races. Back up. You sure you want to do this? I don't give a damn who's out there. Let's go. We'll find Cobra later. You know they're gonna come back for you, right? Shit, not on our watch. So what's gonna happen now? Either Cobra or Ghost is gonna die tonight. Or maybe both. Let's see who you - Captain Liddle? You figured out who I am. Why? How? You killed my brother? Why'd you kill my brother? All these questions, all these fucking- Why'd you kill him? Why'd you kill him? - You want the answer - - Tell me! - To the riddle. - Yeah, so I can kill you. Tell me so I can kill you! Fuck. What? No, no, no! No! I win. Not coming back, either. It's over now. No, you didn't. Titi. Titi, that you? Yeah. It is you. Did you avenge me? No. That I did not. He died, but not by my hands. It doesn't really matter anymore. It matters to me. It's time to go home, Shen. You're not real, are you? No. He's gone, Cobra's dead. It's done. It is not uncommon, once vengeance is sought, there's nothing else to live for. There was nowhere for him to go. What about the Captain? You think he'll come for us? Who? Asshole.
