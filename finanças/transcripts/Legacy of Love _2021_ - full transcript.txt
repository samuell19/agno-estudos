One meeting, a couple of signatures, and then I'll be headed home. Good, I want you to be here for the dance. Oh, I wouldn't miss it for the world. I would, unless I could be the photographer?

Here's my card. Alright. I'm sorry again. - Abby. - Mommy. - No. - Mommy. Jay, are you okay? No. Okay, it's gonna be okay. You gotta just take it one day at a time. Where's my mom? She was so good. She loved us. I don't know, Josh. I don't think there's a God. Why would he do this? I don't think God did this. Okay, this was a drunk driver, Josh. An accident. But she didn't have to die. Do you think there's a God? I don't know what to think right now. I just miss Mom. Beautiful. You think so? My baby girl's all grown up! I just miss Mom. I do too. I know, I know. Daniel, I'm so sorry about what happened. She was a beautiful person. We all loved her. Thank you. I'm so sorry. Oh, thank you so much for coming. Brandon, please say hi to the family. Thank you. The church is there for you, your family is there for you, I'm there for you. I know. Did you know I brought your kids back from the church? Thanks. Nice to see you, Jack. Jack? Hey, hey, Pop? Oh, pastor, it was a beautiful service. Well, thank you. I'm glad you liked it, Jack. You guys wanna go with me and greet the guests? I do. We can't, Jay. Sorry, Grandpa, our dad needs us. Okay, but if you wanna get away, I have a getaway car outside. If you kids feel you wanna get away, let me know, okay? I'm sure they'll take you up on the offer. - Thank you. - Thanks, Pop. How are you two doing? We're not good. Lindsey, do you know Pastor John? He runs the youth group at the church. Yeah, I've met him. Pastor John runs a grief support group as well. Lindsey, please, we would like you to join our grief support group when you're ready. Jay, you can come too. Thanks, pastor. I'm not ready yet. I know, I know. When you are, we're there for you. Thanks, pastor, really. And the church is there for you too, and we'll always be there for you. You've been a lifelong friend. We appreciate it, alright? Thank you, thank you. Alright. God bless. God bless you. Hey, how're you doing? Oh, God. Oh, God, I'm gonna be late! Where is it? I thought it was... Mom, I can't do this without you. God, why would you take her away from me? Why? Hey? Is everything alright? No, nothing is alright! Why can't you understand that? I think I might be able to. No, you can't, because I'm 16. I should still have my Mom! Hey, hey! Have you forgotten that your mother was my wife? I lost her too! I lost her! I'm sorry. Oh God. - I'm sorry, Dad, I didn't... - No, no, no, no. - Oh, no, no, no, no, no. - I'm sorry, Dad. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Look, we're all going through this, alright? We all lost her. Lindsey, look, do you remember that group the pastor was talking about? No, please, - that's not gonna help. - No, no, no. No, it's not gonna help. It won't bring Mom back. No, but it can't hurt either. Look, no, listen, your heart is so pained, your mother would never want you to feel this way. Please, just go for me. Just go, please, just once, just once. - Please, okay? - Fine. But I wanna do this on my own. Okay. Let me drive, okay? - Okay. - Come on. How's your week been, Ava? Good. That's good. We're glad to see you back again. Yeah, it's been a, it's been a wonderful week. We had a lot going on with the church. And, yeah, so we're very excited to have those special activity things lined up as well, so it's always fun with them. Ricky, how've you been this week? For those of you just joining us, I'd like to tell you a bit about what we do here in the group. Our grief support group is a place of healing and of hope. We like to remember our loved ones out loud. We share stories, we share memories good and bad, but more importantly, we support each other through the sadness of loss, and we move into the comfort of knowing that they remain in our hearts and our memories forever. Now, I'd like to have our new members go ahead and introduce themselves, then we'll share some stories. Would you like to go first? Hi, I'm Lindsey. I lost my mom a few months ago. Hi, Lindsey. We're happy to meet you. Thank you for being here. And how about you? Hi, I'm, I'm Andrew. I lost my brother in a car accident about a year ago, and things haven't really gotten better, so my mom recommended I come to a support group. Well, thank you, Andrew. At the very least, we hope you can find some comfort here, and know you're not alone. Thank you. So, would anyone like to begin by sharing a story? I'd like to share my story, John. Oh, Ava, please. My husband and I were trying to have a baby for so long. We thought after IVF and for trying for so long that it would never happen, but we were happy because we knew that we had options. One night we went to a restaurant with my husband's boss. It was this restaurant on the top of a building, really high up. Now, I don't do heights, so I got really sick. It was so embarrassing. The next night I was still sick. I mean, every smell, just about anything made me feel sick. He knew I was pregnant, but I was like, "No, I mean, it can't be." He went out, he bought me a test, and it turns out he was right, I was pregnant. We were so happy. I mean, it was probably one of the second best moments of our lives. Our first was when our baby boy was born. It was pure joy. Our family was complete. A week later, he went on a business trip, and the plane crashed, and he didn't make it. But he got to meet Ryan Junior. Ava, thank you so much for sharing that story. You're welcome. It's hard, but I realized through the process of healing, there are more good memories than there could ever be bad. I just wish that I could hear him again, or see him. Thank you. Would any of our new members like to share a story? I'm not ready yet. That's okay. When you're ready, we'll be here. You know, remembering our loved ones out loud is greatly helpful. It keeps them in our hearts. Andrew, would you like to share? I guess, yeah, yeah. Yeah, I'll go. But it's kind of hard to remember things right now. No good memories, no bad ones, just, it just all sucks. You know, I was in that car accident where my brother died. Why not me? What makes me so special? He was my brother. He was my twin. He was a part of me. We were supposed to travel the world together, and now it's just me, and that ain't right. Andrew, it's, it's not just you. You know, he's still part of you, and remembering him is gonna help you. Thank you for sharing. Pastor John? Yes, Lindsey. Could I tell a little about my mom, maybe? Yes, I think we'd love that. My last memory of her, she was helping me pick out my dress for my first school dance. My mom was so sweet, always loving. Her dream was to be there for me at my wedding, but now she won't be able to. I'm sorry, I can't talk about this yet. And that's okay. Thank you so much for sharing. You know, the healing process takes time. And Lindsey, when you're ready, we'll be here to listen. Well, I think that's a good place to leave it. We do have some flyers over on the table there. It has some fun activities to help the healing process. And before we go, I'd like you do a little bit of homework for this, this next week. Now, before you look at me like that, it's nothing hard. I'd like you to talk to a relative or a mutual friend, and have them share a good memory with you. I'd like you to write it down, and if you feel comfortable, share it when you come back next week, and we'll start on our memory books. Alright? Thanks again for coming everybody. Remember, there are some flyers over by the coffee, that have some recommended reading. As always, if you need to talk to me at all, feel free to come find me. Have a wonderful week. Chocolate chip was Matthew's favorite cookie. Hey, I'm sorry about your brother. Thanks. Sorry about your mother too. Guess we all gotta lose someone at some point. Yeah, but it doesn't feel fair. I know. Were you close to your brother? Yeah, we were pretty much like the same person. We even had our own way of talking to each other. Yeah, I've heard that, that twins can have their own secret language. That's actually really cool. Yeah, yeah, guess so. Well, I gotta go, my dad's waiting. But it was nice to meet you. Hey, I hope you come back. I think I will. Ugh, it's a hot day today, man. Hey, you alright? No, seriously, you okay? I don't know. What's wrong? I don't know. Alright, you wanna talk about it? Why? It won't bring Mom back! No, but it's nice to remember her. Lindsey says Mom is living in heaven now with God. I just wish I could talk to her, Dad. It would be so nice if a text or phone call could reach all the way up to heaven. I know. Look, I knew someone that wrote a message in a- - I don't want that, I want Mom! I want Mom too, okay? I'm sorry things have changed. Dad, I don't wanna hike today. I just wanna go back home. Right, you don't wanna hike? You just wanna go home? Yeah. Watch a movie with me? Sure. It's hot anyway, right? Come on, come on. I'm having a real hard time here, Abby. The kids are so sad. I'm just trying to make them feel loved. Just don't laugh at me if I start to cry. You know, I remember you saying once that real men do cry. Well, this man cries for you. I love you, Abby. Oh, man. Those cookies smell great. If it's cookies, you know it's for me. Every kid loves cookies. Dad, it's for group. Oh. Can we just have one? Just one? Not unless you come to group with me. Good luck. This is a real nice thing you're doing here. Thanks, Dad. How about one for the old man? Want an apple? Sure. Andrew, this is my little brother, Josh. Josh, meet Andrew. Hey, Josh. So, you're the reason my sister won't let me have any cookies, aren't you? Me? Well, nice to meet you too, Josh. I'm gonna go sit down. You can stop now. I'm just messing with you, little man. Coming to a good spot. Place helps me out a lot. Sure. How's your week been? I've had a good week. Did you have a good week? Yeah, it was. My dad set up to scholarship in my mom's name, and we met a few of the recipients. Oh, that's cool. Yeah, it really was. Hey, you wanna go get coffee sometime? Maybe talk about your mother, or my brother, or the weather? Yeah, I'd like that. Maybe you can meet my best friend, Katie. Yeah, yeah, that'd be cool. Okay, let's go. Yeah. Alright, everyone. Well, let's go ahead and take our seats, and we can begin. It's always nice to see new faces in the group. And as a little reminder, I like to say what it is we do in this group. Our grief support group is a place of healing and hope. We like to remember our loved ones out loud. We share stories, we share memories, good and bad, and more importantly, we like to support each other, as we move from the sadness of loss, to finding the comfort of knowing that our loved ones reside in our hearts and our memories forever. I'd like the new faces in the group to go ahead and introduce themselves. And we'll go ahead and start sharing some stories. My name's Josh and my sister made me come. Well, it's good to see you, Josh. Thank you for coming. Thanks for bringing him, Lindsey. And? Hi, my name is Carrie. I lost my baby boy. He had cancer. Hi, Carrie. I really hope both of you can find some comfort in being here with us. Carrie, would you like to share a little more about your story? No pressure. No, I'm not ready. It's, it's hard to talk about still. We're glad you're here. If you need to talk, I'm always here. I lost my mom not too long ago, and I know it's not the same, but this group is really helping me. Thank you, Lindsey. Whatever we can do to help, that's why we're here. So, everyone, how's the week been? It's been better. My mother and I went to see my dad's grave. So, well, she decided to start a scholarship in his name, so. That's wonderful, and I'm sure he'd be very proud. Thank you for sharing, Ricky. How's your week been, Ava? Oh, mine, mine actually has been really good. I've had more good days than bad, which I never thought would happen. We're actually planning a trip to see Ryan's parents this weekend, so. That sounds like a wonderful trip. Yeah, I might be missing a few meetings. Oh, well, that's okay. Certainly a good reason. Yeah. Andy, how's your week been, sir? You know, I'm still having a hard time. You know, sometimes I still feel angry about it all, him dying and me surviving. But my mom was actually going through his stuff, and she found this dictionary. It's the dictionary, we used to use it, to make our own language. When I looked at it, something clicked. Just realized he was a part of me. And how has that impacted your healing? Well, I can at least talk about him. You know, that's a big step for me. That's a great start. You know, continuing to remember our loved ones out loud is always so helpful, you know? It keeps them right in our hearts. Yeah. It hasn't been easy, but I've been trying. Lindsay, how you been? Honestly, I'm okay. You know, I know my mom's always with me, and my dad and I, we did some things in her memory. And I guess I'm just not as angry as I was before. That's great to hear. I'm happy to hear with your progress. I'm really proud of all of you. You know, these, these reports are great, you know? I'd actually like to take a time of prayer. Bow our heads in prayer. Heavenly father, we thank you for this wonderful night you've given us. Thank you for reminding us that your mercies are new every day. It says in the book of Matthew, that blessed are those who mourn, for they will be shown mercy. We pray that your grace continuously follows us through our day. And we pray that you bless our going as you blessed our coming here tonight. Thank you. It's in your name we pray. Amen. Dad, Dad. Yeah. Teach me to play guitar. What now? Yeah, I wanna write songs like you do. Look. What have you got? This is pretty good. Yeah, it's for Mom. You know what, here, you got it. Here, give me that guitar. Take the old man's guitar. Do you remember that E minor chord that I showed you - a while back? - Yeah. Yeah? Let's see what you got. Here, take the pick. Try that. Yeah, you're right on the mark. Let's do another one. Do you remember D7? Yeah, one there. Actually, no, put this finger up here. Hit that. See how that works? Not bad, could be better. Very good! Hey, there you go. Thank you. Of course, you're welcome. So, did you enjoy group last time? I dunno, I'm starting to really like it. Like, it's helping me. Me too. I didn't think I could stop feeling angry or guilty about it all, but little by little, I am. That's good. Oh, there's Katie. Katie's here. Hi. Hey, Katie. Hi, hi. Katie, this is Andrew from group. Andrew, this is Katie, from like my whole life. Hi, hi, how you doing? Hi. So, you're the one that eats all the cookies. Um, how did you know? I heard. Hmm. Hey, Dad. Oh hey, pumpkin. How was your day? It was great. Oh, that's right, it was your third date. How'd it go? Dad, it's not a date. Alright, alright, it wasn't a date. Look, I got some dinner in the fridge for you, alright? Don't be up too late, school tomorrow. I won't. - Thanks, Dad. - Alright, alright. Goodnight. We're gonna be okay, Abby, girl. So, I was thinking we could go to Mayfields. I heard they have a sale, so. Katie, Katie, are you okay? Sorry, what? Is everything alright? No, not really. Okay, I can just pull over. What's going on? Everything, Lindsey. Tell me. My mom has cancer. Stage four. What? I'm trying to be strong. We just found out. It's bad, but she said she's going to fight. I'm so sorry. God, I can't even... I don't know what to do. I don't want her to see me crying. I'm so scared. Hey, hey, it's gonna be okay. I'm gonna be here for you no matter what, okay? Thank you. How about we talk about some happy stuff? Okay. Isn't that, what's his face who's taking you to prom, that guy? Brett. Brett, the basketball guy, yeah. He hasn't asked me yet, but I was thinking it'd be fun if just a bunch of us went together. Yeah, gonna be fine. We can get a limo, ride in style. Love you, girl. It's gonna be okay. So, you excited for prom tonight? Yeah. Do you think it's weird, Lindsey and I decided not to go with any boys, and just go with our girlfriends? Oh, yeah, it's so weird, Kat, but better for your dad and I. Now, we don't have to do that whole crazy father parent thing that dads do. Here's the lovely Miss Lindsey. Hi! I'll be right back. Hello, Sara, how are you doing? I'm fighting hard. It's good to see you. It's good to see you too. Why don't we go get ready? Okay, bye. You girls have fun. Thank you, Mom. Sorry, I left my makeup bag. Actually, I'm glad you're here. Can you sit with me for a minute? Yeah, of course. What's wrong? I need your help, Lindsey. I don't have long. I'm struggling with it. And I know that Katie is not gonna do well when I'm gone. I wanna do something for her, that'll bring her comfort you know, during important times in her life. Will you help me make a video message for her? Yeah. Yeah, of course. And don't tell her. I'll entrust them to you, and you just make sure she gets them when the time's right, okay? Okay. Okay. You go on, get ready. I'll contact you to set up a day and time soon. I'll see you. Bye. - Tom? - Yes, dear. Can you bring me my Bible, please? Anything for you, my love. You mind if I read with you? No. Oh, oh, thank you. Katie sure did look beautiful for the prom tonight, didn't she? Oh, she did. There you go. Thank you, honey. Huh, for what? You know. What, for loving you? I love you, Tom. And I know you're going to do the right thing, and raise our daughter right. I'm not giving up on you, Sara. I know. Thank you for this, Lindsey. You're welcome, Sara. I know how much this is gonna mean to Katie. Right. It means everything to me too. I don't have much I can leave her, but reminders of how proud I am of her, how much I love her, bring me some peace. She's gonna be here in about 30 minutes, so we should get started. I'm just gonna put some lipstick on. Of course, How does that look? You look beautiful. Okay, I'm ready when you are. Katie, when you receive this message, I'll be with God and our savior, Jesus Christ, in heaven and free of pain. I will always be watching over you in spirit. And today is such a special day. You're graduating from high school with honors, and I'm so proud of you. I want you to enjoy it, and take tons of pictures with your friends and your dad. And enjoy that moment, when you move your tassel, and throw your hat in the air. Going to UF is going to be amazing for you, and I hope that you have a memorable college experience, honey. Katie, please try and go to church regularly. Read your Bible and pray. I've left my Bible for you, and I've had Pastor Mark notate all my favorite Bible verses for you to reference, and give you strength. I will always be with you. I love you, Katie. Okay, I got it. Lindsey, I have one more favor. Yeah. Anything. I got a graduation card for Katie. Can you make sure she gets it when she graduates? Yeah, of course. But you'll be able to give it to her, right? Appreciate it. Thank you so much for sharing, Rick, and let's put that in your memory book. Hello, Lindsey. - Hi. - Hey, Lindsey. I'm sorry I'm late. I was helping my friend's mom with something. No, that's okay. Sometimes we have things to do. Don't worry about it. Well, it wouldn't be the same without you. I'm having a hard time with this one. Why? It's my best friend's mom, she's dying, and I'm trying to do something special for Katie so she can have something after she's gone. Well, that's very sweet of you to help her. But are you okay? I am, but I can't stop thinking about my mom. Sometimes, it's just like I lost her all over again. Well, I'm sure what you're doing to help Katie will bring her great comfort. Well, I'm helping her mom make a video message for her, and I still have to edit it with some of her mom's favorite pictures at the end. But, I don't know. I like that. I'd love to see my brother again. Or my baby. Or my husband. My father. My mom. You know, I think we all have someone whose voice we'd love to hear again. I think it's very sweet of you to help your friend. And you know, you could always invite Katie here, you know? She doesn't have to wait until her mother passes to get support. I don't know. She's not ready to deal with her mom dying yet. And Sara's still fighting. Maybe she'll make it. It's true. We'll be praying. Thanks. Ava would you like to continue with your story? Alright. Oh, why don't you go ahead and check that? It doesn't happen often, it might be important. I'm so sorry. I have to go. No worries. Where are you? Dad, what happened? You're scaring me. Katie's mom passed away. Oh, I need to go see her. No, no, no, no, no, listen, you can't. They're at the hospital. You're not gonna be able to see them until tomorrow. I'm sorry. We finished just in time. What, what did you, what? What? Her mom and I, we made this video for Katie for her graduation. It's like, she knew. That's gonna mean the world to her. It's like losing Mom all over again. Yeah, I know. That's why I wanted to- - Hey, Dad, I really, I really need to be alone. No, no, no just wait. This is so beautiful, Mom. I wonder what you would have said to me. But I know this will help Katie. I just know. I think Mom would have liked the ceremony. Yeah, I think so too. Does the pain ever go away? Honestly? It does and it doesn't. We'll never stop missing them. I don't know how you did it. It's so hard. Time, remember the good things. Mom, do you think I can do it? You can do it, Lindsey. I believe in you. I guess that sometimes helps. We graduate in one month. She wanted to be here so bad for that. Just one more month. I know this probably won't mean much right now, but I truly believe that she's here with us. She's with God now. It's not the same. Hey. Just, I wonder why she's not here yet. She's never late. I don't know. Maybe call her? I don't know. I have a really bad feeling about this, like she's not okay. I'm sure she's alright. Just call her. Okay, well. Oh, I bet that's her now. Everything okay? No, it's not. Katie's not okay. What happened? She said she's not coming. She said she can't stop crying. It's gonna be alright. What should I do? What can you do? I mean, I can go give her the message from her mom. I know it's supposed to be for the graduation, but I think she needs it now. You sure? I mean, it is your party. You sure? I don't know. Why do bad things happen to good people? I just don't understand. Hey, hey, hey, you know what? You know what, listen, I'll finish these decorations up, and you go see Katie. Deliver that message to her. Are you sure? I'm sure, alright. Parties come and go, but best friends are forever. Thank you. Katie. Lindsey. Hey, it's gonna be okay. I'm not so sure. I'm not ready to be without my mom. I know, I know, but she's with you. How would you know? I have something for you? I was supposed to give it to you after graduation, but I don't think your mom would mind if I gave it to you now. What do you mean, my mom? It's from your mom. She made it for you. What is this about? What is this? Just trust me. Watch it. Katie, when you receive this message, I'll be with God and our savior, Jesus Christ, in heaven and free of pain. I will always be watching over you in spirit. Today is such a special day. You're graduating from high school with honors, and I'm so proud of you. I want you to enjoy it. I'm sorry, Katie. I didn't mean to make you cry like this. - Take tons of pictures - No. with your friends and your dad. No, it's just so beautiful. And enjoy that moment. I miss her so much. When you move your tassel. Thank you. - Yeah. - And throw your hat in the air. Kat, you should come to group with me sometime. Maybe. Going to you UF, - I'll just take it - is going to be - one day at a time. - amazing for you. Okay. Katie. Oh, open your card. Please try and go to church regularly. Read your Bible. I, I've left my Bible for you. Thank you. And I've had Pastor Mark, I have to go and show Dad, but thank you! - notate all my favorite - Thank you so much. - readings, - I really needed this. for you to reference and give you strength. Dad, Dad, look, you have to come watch! What's happening? Look, just come watch. What is it? Just watch, trust me. And I'm so proud of you. I want you to enjoy it. That's... Mom. Take tons of pictures. She left it me for my graduation. She remembered me. And enjoy that moment, when you move your tassel. She's here with us. And throw your hat in the air. And she's with God watching over us. Going to UF - is going to be amazing - She loves us. for you. Katie. Hey, honey. Hey, Dad. Okay, I was just thinking, you know that video that Sara made for Katie? Yeah. I mean, it really helped her. You know, I thought it was gonna make her more sad, but she was excited, and she ran and told her dad. Oh, I'm happy to hear that. You know, I've been researching, and I wanna do this for more people, you know? Do you think I'm too young to start a nonprofit? No, no, I don't think so. Let's do a little research. With a little faith, I'm pretty sure you're the one that can do that. Thanks, Dad. Goodnight, alright? Night. Hey, come sit by me. Katie, it's good to see you again. Thank you. Katie, you're Lindsey's friend? Yeah, since elementary school. Oh, well it's great to have you here with us. Thank you. I'm not sure I'm ready to talk about it yet, but thank you. That's quite alright. Thank you for being here. Alright, everyone, let's go ahead and get started. You know, as always, I like to just put a little reminder out there, about what we do here in this group. Our grief support group is a place of healing and hope. We like to remember our loved ones out loud. You know, we share stories, we share memories good and bad, and more importantly, we support each other and move through the sadness of loss to find the comfort in knowing that our loved ones remain in our heart, and in our memories forever. Now, before we get started, I'd like to have our guest introduce herself, and then we'll go ahead and share some stories. Hi, everyone, I'm Katie. I lost my mom to cancer. I'm just taking it one day at a time. Well, thank you for being here, Katie. This is a great place of healing, and to know you're not alone in this process. Pastor, Katie's the one I helped make the video for. Oh, that's great. We've heard great things. How did it make you feel, Katie? Honestly, until Lindsey showed me that video, I didn't know I was going to be okay. But seeing my mom and hearing her voice, I felt so close to her, close to God. I was angry until that moment. I showed my dad right away, and we laughed and cried and pulled out the family videos and photo albums. And I mean, it helped us realize that my mom was always going to be with us. I just wish Lindsey would've gotten a video like that from her mom. Me too. Yeah. Well, I mean, I bet everyone would like to hear a message from their loved ones. I think that's a wonderful legacy to leave, you know, for anyone's loved one. Yeah, I think getting a message from your loved one can be really comforting. - The legacy of love. - Yeah. Pastor, I've been thinking about this a lot, and I think there's a way that we can channel all of our pain and our suffering, into something that can help others who are grieving like us one day. What do you mean? Well, I've been researching, and I think a nonprofit could be created. Call it the Living Legacy of Love. We can reach out to those who soon may be transitioning, and help them leave messages for their loved ones. I'd be down. You could help out a lot of people. - Yeah. - I'd be game. We should do it. Wait, what? Do you really think that you can help these people? What if you cause more pain? Like, are you really thinking this through? I hadn't thought about that. I just know what I witnessed with Katie. Yeah, I mean, I get what you're saying, but what if it actually does provide comfort? What if? You don't know that. I understand where you're coming from, but I think it could bring more love, and a reminder to a deeper connection with those who passed on. Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Well, I'd like to know more. Yeah. I'm not saying I don't approve of this, but what if you're reminding them of what they lost? I can't speak for other people, but that message gave me strength. It gave me hope. I mean, it's worth a shot. Losing someone you love is just too painful. How do we start? Well, we start where there's the most need. Hospice, hospitals, assisted living, you know, things like that. Yeah, and we can, we can, We could make flyers! Yeah, and we can let them know it's free, and- - That'd be so cool. And I bet a lot of people would help out. Yeah, totally. I'm not crazy about the idea, but I work at an assisted living facility. I can ask if you can speak with the residents. You can bring your flyers. That would be so awesome. I do know that the community center rents out camera equipment from time to time. I can talk to them. And, you know, I mean, you know, I think we should do this, you know? But we have to make sure we do it the right way. Okay, well, my dad's already set up. He's trying to get the nonprofit rolling. And it'd be great if you all wanted to join. I wanna help. It's brought me so much comfort. I want to. You know, I'll go ahead and get in contact with your father. That way we can kind of have this thing all taken care of. And you know, I'd like to talk about it more in depth after the, after group, okay? Thank you. Pastor John, I have good news. Well, you must have with that smile. Go ahead and tell me. My dad says a Living Legacy of Love is ready to begin helping people. Well, that is good news. Okay, well, let's let everybody know to get ready to distribute these flyers, and we can start spreading the word. Well here, what do you think of this? I love it. Well, good. Call Katie and Andy, let them know the flyers are ready, and the shirts will be done in a few days. I will. We need to put these everywhere. I hope people will respond. I believe they will. I do too. Hey, Pastor John, I put flyers everywhere. Oh, good work, Andy. Thank you. Now what? Do we do more flyers? Guys, why hasn't anyone called yet? Maybe I'm wrong. No, you're not wrong. Ladies, have faith, you know? We're meant to help people. Just give it some time. Hi, this is the Living Legacy of Love. Hi, can I talk to Lindsey? This is Lindsey. Well, Lindsey, I just got your flyer, and I would like to record a message for my daughter. Yeah, of course. What time do you want us to come? Wednesday at six? Okay, we'll be there. Thank you so much. Guys, we just got our first client. Wow. - Let's go! - That's awesome. Go! That's very awesome. Hey, Brian, nice to meet you. Hey, how you doing, man? - Good, good. - Hey, Brian. - Pleased to meet you. - How are you guys? - Good. - Oh man, I've been better. I love what you guys do here. Well, we're glad you're here. Thank you. We'll give you a hand with- - Oh, thank you, thank you. Yeah, I got it, I got it. Thank you, you're too kind. How you doing, man? Oh, I've been a little better. But, one day at a time. But hey, I was wondering, can you visit my little brother for me? He's gonna need someone to teach him how to ride his board. - Yeah. - You know, it was only the beginning before this happened. Yeah, yeah, I got you. What's his name? His name is Jake. Yeah, yeah, I'll deliver it myself. Oh, thank you, man, thank you. Oh, one more thing? Yeah, what is it? 50, actually. What do you mean? It's, it's for my dad. Yeah, there's a few notes and whatnot for my mom, but his birthday is next month. That's so sweet. Thanks. Hopefully he can get some laughs out of it. You know, we are pretty close, and he hasn't been taking this very well. Well, Brian, we're actually just about ready. How you doing? Oh, I've been better, but I'm gonna say, this is, this is great. I'm just thankful I could even do this. Hopefully it brings me some peace. Well, before we all start crying, Brian, you ready? Just tell me when. Whenever you're ready, the camera's rolling. Alright. So, Dad, I hear you're turning 50 next month, man. Oh, geez. Looks like you're heading over that hill, huh? Look, I just, I just wanted to wish you happy birthday. Mom, give the old man a hug from me, yeah? Look, Mom, I'm sure when you had children, you know, this wasn't exactly what you had in mind for our future or anything. But I just want to let you know, even though my time here is short, I had a wonderful life. I couldn't have asked for a better family. I'm always gonna be watching over you, kid. Because God has a plan. So, remember these two things, keep your faith, and I will always love you. Thank you for giving me such a wonderful life. He was really sweet. He was. It must be hard for them, not having their parents know who they are. I mean, at least they have each other. Yeah. Me and Josh really needed each other when my mom died. I never realized just how much. No, it isn't easy what we're doing. It, you know, it doesn't make the pain and loss go away. But I hope that it makes them feel less alone. Yeah, me too. I can't believe we've already helped 50 people. Yeah, I know, it's crazy. We've helped a lot of people out. Like, I was thinking people, like, wouldn't like my idea, but it's helped people so much to see their loved ones, - you know? - Yeah, yeah, I mean, we're impacting a lot of lives. A lot of people are gonna be impacted by what we're doing. And there's hundreds more. It can never end. We could do this forever. Yeah. I can't. Hey Linds? Yeah? I was thinking maybe, maybe we can go to dinner sometime? - Hang out a bit. - That'd be fun. We can invite Katie. Hey. Hey, Ricky. - Got my camera. - What's up? Yeah, we're good. Yeah, but I was thinking more me and you, more of a me and you thing. Not really all of us. Like a date? Yeah, if you want to. - No, no, yeah, of course. - I'm not trying to pressure you but- - Yeah, I can call Katie later. Okay, yeah. You ready to? Let's get out of here. Mikey, Michael, by the time you see this, you'll be heading off to college, or you better be. But I'll be proud of you no matter what. Cut. One down, two to go. You're strong, man. It must be hard doing this so many times. Yeah, it is. But hey, maybe we'll get lucky and we won't need them. They say I got some time. I'm starting chemo. But I knew that when I saw this, that it was a great opportunity to leave something beautiful for my family, just in case. Well, why this park? I've always been a runner. It's the only way I can unwind. I bring the kids with me on shorter runs, and we always stop here, right at this bench. We just, you know, talk and laugh and goof off. That's a great reason to pick this place. Ready for another? Ready. Camera's rolling. I just want you to know that you have always amazed me with your brilliance, your ability to solve problems. You are such a kind soul. I did a good job with you. Ah, your mom helped a little. What I'm saying is I love you. And as you graduate, know that I am with you and watching over you always. So, say your prayers, and believe that great things can happen, because they can and they do. And keep me in your life by remembering me out loud. Go with your mom to church. Seek comfort in God, because God and I, we got you. I love you, kid. You did good. I can't believe how many people we've helped so far. It's a blessing for us and for them. I feel like this is my purpose, you know, to help these people. I don't- Excuse me. Hi, yes, how many we help you? My name's Rebecca Alton. I got a call from someone that my mother left something for me here? Yes, hi, Rebecca. Yeah, hi, I'm Lindsey. We do have something from you, actually from your mother. My mom passed away a few weeks ago, so how can you? Well, Rebecca, we met your mother two months ago, and she left you a message. Would you like to watch it now? Please, it'll bring you comfort. She loves you. I'm not sure that I understand that, but okay. My darling little girl, when you watch this, I will have moved on to be with the Lord, but I will always be with you on the journey through this life. I want you to know, I love you, I'm so proud of you, and you will never be alone. I'm always be with you in your heart. I'm watching over you. I love you, Mom. I love you, Rebecca. Excuse me, sir. What do you want? I'm sorry to bother you. I'm from a Living Legacy of Love. Your son, Brian, sent me. Robert, Robert? What's going on here? This guy, he said that Brian sent him. Why? Brian's dead, leave! Jake, Jake, please. Brian sent us for you. Why? He said you needed a big brother figure. He wanted me to teach you. I don't need anything from you. Jake, please just listen to me. I understand what you're going through. I lost my brother too. We just wanna share the message that Brian left for you. I can leave this here and go? Come on, let's go. Come inside. Let's talk. I don't understand. What is it that Brian did? Here, this is for you all. What is this? It's a message from your son, Brian. What does it say? I can't say. Just, just watch. Go on. Son, it's, go ahead and hit play. Looks like you're heading over that hill, huh? Look, I just, I just wanted to wish you a happy birthday. Mom, give the old man a hug from me, yeah? Even though my time here is short, I had a wonderful life, and support, and I want, I want you to feel the same as well. I hope this message brings you comfort. Even though I'd much rather be here in my own body, I'm always gonna be watching over you, kid, because God has a plan. So, remember these two things, keep your faith and I will always love you. Thank you for listening. Jake, whenever you're ready, just give me a call, and I'll teach you how to use that thing. Okay. Thank you. Of course. Thank you so much. This was so beautiful. You're welcome. Seriously, don't push me in again. I'm sorry, I couldn't resist. You're so bad. Oh, yeah, how'd it go with Brian's family? I wish you were there, but it went pretty well. The mom seemed to be really moved by the message. You can, you can tell the family's still hurt by it all. But I think seeing Brian's message brought them some hope. So glad we're doing this together. It just feels right. It does. Yeah, me too, me too. Hey, I'll give you two seconds to swim. Dad, it's 24! I knew you'd get it. Very good. What else do we have here? Hello, this is Lindsey. Hi, Lindsey. We'd like to send our news reporter, to interview you about a Legacy of Love. Yes, yes, when? How about Monday at 6 p.m.? Okay, I'll be there, Monday at six. Thank you so much. Dad, Dad, I need to tell you something! This message really hit me hard. So much heart. Dean really did love his wife. I know. I'm glad he called us to record him. It doesn't get easier, doing what we're doing, making these videos, but there's a genuine comfort in knowing that even a little bit of their loved ones are gonna come back to them through what we're doing. It's something for them that will live on through generations. A living legacy of love. So, that's where the name comes from. It all makes sense now. Living Legacy of Love. How can I help you? Okay, yeah, we can come to you, or you can come to us. Okay, perfect. What's the address? Okay, Wednesday at six. We'll be there. Thank you. Hey, you know what'd be nice? If we invited everyone we gave the videos to, to come to group. We could do that. Yeah, that's a great idea. We can prepare a special invitation, and bring it with the messages when we deliver them. I love it. Here they come, let's go. Fantastic, okay we'll do that. Yeah. Are you the Living Legacy of Love group? Yeah. Lindsey, the Living Legacy of Love was your brain child. Now, that you've helped over a hundred people, how do you feel? Well, I'm at peace with it, but there are hundreds more and it will never end. As long as we can keep bringing love and peace to people, then the Living Legacy of Love will have a place. It's never ending. That's beautiful. Lindsey, how was the name Living Legacy of Love chosen? Was there something that inspired you? Yeah. Well, our loved ones are alive when they record their message. And their message is a gift of love, and it's a legacy they leave for us. I mean, it's priceless, worth more than any material thing could ever be. It can be shared with the loved ones left behind, and even with future family members. It's a living legacy of love, as it brings them back to us, even if it's just for a few moments at a time. Yeah, the name just felt right. I can see that. It's so powerful to know that when someone's hurting so much, that they can be touched by a loved one's message. What would you want us to take away from your experiences and path of giving that? When my mom died, I was so lost. I didn't think my life could have a purpose, or a direction without her in it. But slowly I realized that we all have a purpose, and we're never alone. God is with us always. Our loved ones are always with us. And I really want people to know that even though their loved one has crossed over, they're always with you, and that love never dies. I think she said it perfectly, folks. If you'd like to learn more about Living Legacy of Love, go to our website and you can find their information and their links. Alright, thank you so much. Dad? Yeah. Don't you think Grandpa's dementia is getting kind of bad? I mean... Yeah, look, you know how Grandma's in the hospital for hip surgery, well when she's not around, his memory begins to fade and... Yeah. I don't know, maybe we could play a video of her, see if he remembers? Yeah, do you have one? Yeah, I have multiple. We could play that one? That was a good day. Give it a shot. Right. Hey, Grandpa. Hey, Pop. Hey, we- - Pop, Pop. We have a video of Grandma. Oh, let me see. You remember Grandma? Grandma? Okay, open it. Where is she? - Are you ready? - She's in the hospital. She's in the hospital for her hip surgery. Hey, look, it's her. - Really? - Really. Really? You know I love wine and chocolate. She is so beautiful. I miss her. She's, look at her. Oh, well, what a beautiful, her smile just radiates. - Aw. - I love her, oh. Oh, look at that. Oh my goodness, that's... Yeah, that's the best. You used to give a fig, Grandpa. Oh my goodness. I do love it. We could be twinsies Cookies, again? Yeah! You know I wouldn't mind being with you. I gotta go though. My dad says we have to be home. Linds, before we go, could I talk to you about something? Yeah, of course, babe, what's up? I brought you something. It's little, but it means a lot to me. Linds, you mean the world to me. Since we met at the church, you fully restored faith in my life. And not only in my life, but we've helped so many people restore their hope and their love. Most importantly, we brought love back to them. Mom, how do you know when it's true love? Well, you just know, like your dad and I. The right person will represent hope and faith and love. I wouldn't worry about that. You look so beautiful. I don't know what to say. Linds, when you wear this necklace, I want you to be reminded of three things. The cross represents faith, the anchor represents hope, and the heart represents love, which is everything you are to me. It's beautiful, Andrew. You look great in it. Thank you, I love it. You're welcome. I would give anything to have my mom here with me. For a long time, I was angry with my own pain. Sometimes people grieving, well, we get caught up in our own pain, so much so, we can't see how serving others in pain would help, or why we should even do it. I was just so angry with life, with God, but I grew in my faith. I realized that helping people also helped me heal. For me, being able to help people heal and have faith has been the greatest gift from God. I know that a Living Legacy of Love has brought hope to so many people, and it will for years to come. Never feel alone. Know that God is always with you. Hey, Mom. First off, I wanna say thank you for finally sharing that secret lasagna recipe with me. You made Tony and my boys so happy. Maybe you could make it for them too. I also, I just, I wanna say that, that being your daughter, has been such an honor. You've always been my hero. I hope I've made you proud. I'm gonna miss your hugs. I'm gonna miss your hugs and your weird mom jokes. Please tell them to my boys. Help them remember who I am. And remember that they're your family too. Don't be sad and don't be alone. I love you, Mom. I love you. Carla, this message means that I'm watching over you. Please don't be sad. We had 20 beautiful years, and three beautiful children. I want you to laugh, feel joy, and tell stories about me, so that our children and our grandchildren would know how much I love you and our family. Until we meet again, I love you, my sweet wife. Thank you for so many wonderful years. Oh, honey, I know you're hurting without me. That's why I wanted to try to do this, a tape, while I still could. I can't thank you enough for being there for me all these years, and facing the big C with me. I know it wasn't easy. How could it be? I wasn't always myself and I'm sorry for that. It just wasn't fair. But I want you to know that you weren't just the love of my life, you were my life, and you brought so much joy and laughter into this family. But now it's time for you to live, baby, and share that big, beautiful light inside of yours, with the world. Hey, Megs, I know everyone says this in the movies, but if you are watching this, I have left this world. I wanted to leave you something that not only would inspire you, but comfort you. And even though I'm not in this world with you physically, I will always be with you here. No tears. You have to keep your chin up, okay? You have to be strong for Scotty, alright? Promise me you'll fill yours and Scotty's life with as much love as this world can give you. In this life, the afterlife, and in the lives to follow, together forever. Until we are together again, I love you so much.
