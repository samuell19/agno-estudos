Skaters by the very nature are urban guerrillas. They make everyday use of the useless artifacts of the technological burden and employ the handiwork of the government corporate structure in a thousand ways that the original architects could never dream of. I'm starving. What do we even have to eat for breakfast? Uh, oh. Dude, where are we getting money for rent this month? What breakfast? Chicken biscuits? No, man. Where are we going to get money for rent this month? - Oh, dude. The rent. - Yeah. My brother hit me up the other day and said he's got some extra work for us next week. Don't even worry about it, dude. All right. Where are we skating? I need to get some more clips for this video, dude. Give it to Dave. Give it to another rep and maybe be able to get some free product to sell for him. Yeah. Good idea. Let's just hit the spot on the way the shop. Two for one special See what the homies are skating, you know? Yo, we'll let's go skate, man. I'm ready to skate. Yeah, dude. Let's skate for sure. Let's go. You're ready, already? I still gotta put my pants on, dude. Serve it up, Chef Tom. What is this? Turn it up! Come on, Ollie. Yeah! My man. Let's get it. Hey, hey, hey! Hey Jango. What's up, man? I don't want you to see. It was really cold last night. Oh, man. But look, I got this new sleeping bag. That's really nice. It's fresh, man. I spent all my money on the sleeping bag, man. You think maybe a dollar? Of course, man. Really? You are the bomb, man. Really? We all need some help. Here you go, buddy. - Here. - Thanks, man. Go buy breakfast, first. Thanks, man. I'm going to bring you a biscuit. All right. Bring me a biscuit. - All right, buddy. - Thanks, brother. You are the bomb. What's this? These are the plans for lot 13, off of Central. We're finally going to evict the property so we can turn it into multimillion dollar condos. These eyesores can't pay their bills. So they're going into foreclosure. It's time to put them in the dirt, building and all. What if they repay their debt? How much could they possibly owe? We're going to put pressure on them so they have to get out. Screw those skater punks. Yo, Dave. What's up, man? Dave, you ready to peep this footy? How you doing today, dude? You know. Another day, another dollar. We just got done skating, man. Dave, you got to check out these clips. Jake has been stacking. We filmed this all downtown. Wow. You're getting really good. Keep putting tricks together like that, you'll get flowed in no time. Really, you think? You think are you kidding me? I've never seen anything like that. Put a tape together. I'll send this out to some reps. Yeah. That would be awesome. Thanks, Dave. Of course. They're going to love that. Let me grab this phone. All right. Dude. I can put that tape together for you, later. I'll edit it, dude. Atmosphere Skate Shop. Ah, Hey Randy. I want to talk to you about the- - Listen, I won't have that money until Friday for that last order, but I need a rush on it. Well, I'll have it Friday. Yo, evicted?! You can't close the account. We've been doing business for 20 years. Dude, check this out. Let me see. Is that real? Yeah, by Friday. All right. Thanks, Randy. It says Dave's name right here. What did I miss, guys? Dave, I don't mean to get in your business, man. But is the shop getting evicted? Well, it's no secret. I haven't exactly been doing very well, lately. Getting behind on some orders and got this loan that I took out. I'm getting behind on it. It's not good. Don't worry about paying me for watching the shop anymore, Dave. Well, I still got to come up with the money to get these accounts caught up and I'm like five grand behind on rent. It's not looking good, guys. We're going to try to fix this. I'm sure it'll be fine, guys. Thanks, Dave. Yeah. We'll be back, Dave. Let's do this. Y'all have a good day. - Thanks for coming in. - See you, dude. All right, right here. Okay. Who's getting that butt whooped? Yo, what up? Yo what up, Dollamenu? That was sick, man. What up, DJ? If it isn't Tweedle-Dee and Tweedle-Dum. What up, Shawn? What up, Jake man? You guys are here early. Hey Tom, you down to grab a clip for me for the gram, real quick? Um, yeah dude. Wait. Your battery is dusty. Dude, my charging skills are the worst. But I got this, first try. First try. Let's peep this. Golden. Dude. Dusted. You said it was the first try. Wait, what? Evicted? I mean, I know Dave can't be raking it in but I thought he was still doing all right. Nah. What if we throw a massive party and charge them all to come in? My cousin he does it all the time. I know someone. Oh man, here we are. Hey guys. Hey, how you doing? How can I help you? We are on a road trip and he's been doing nothing but asking for a skateboard. We were hoping to find a shop and we found you. Thanks for coming in. Yeah. How old are you? I'm seven. Seven! Is this your first board? Yep. Outstanding. Big moment. It's a really big moment. So he's probably a 7.5. Seven, five? Yeah. One more inch, he'd be an eight. So these three boards here are seven five. If you want to pick one of those. Hey. Dude, this is the moment where you pick your first skateboard. You can't do this again. So make sure whatever you get, you really want it, okay? Okay. And you have to keep it forever. Yes. No matter how many pieces it's in. Like 2000? Yeah. Well, look. Splinters man. I like this one. That's the one? Oh, that's excellent. That's pretty cool. What would you call it? Rainbow Rip. Rainbow Rip. Oh, I like that. All right. So next thing we need to do is pick your trucks and your wheels, your bearings, and we'll put some grip tape on it. Trucks, first. That's a big decision. I want those. Oh, perfect choice. And you're in luck. This is the last set we have and they fit this board perfectly. There you go. Destiny, dude. Destiny is ours! You have got to pick your wheels. What wheels do you like? Wheels next, dude. Second biggest decision. - The wheels. - That's right. I'm going to have to with the gold. They're just so pretty. Yeah. Hey, one thing, all right? Those bearings are the exact bearings that I skated when I put my first board together. Then of course I want that. Oh, yeah. All right. So this is it? Final decision. Yeah. I think it's really cool that you're passing it down. I think it's cool that you guys exist. Oh. I just didn't want him to have to go online to get his first skateboard. I wanted the same experience that I got, you know? Right. I used to live at a skate shop. Right. I sat on their couch watching the skate video over and over again before skating. I'd stand on the boards five times each before I chose the right one. Of course. It's just not the same if you're not here. Yeah. It's hard to compete with the online business, but they can't compete with this. You can't replace this. Right. So, thank you. Thanks for coming in. Do you mind if I set it up with him? Oh no. I think that would be so cool. Show him how it's done. Grip tape. You ready to cut your thumbs up? Let's do it. All right, you're going to flip it over. The broad has to be like this. Right? Then we take the sheet of grip. We're gonna have to peel this back, right? You wanna help me with this? Now put your finger here and push it and move it across the bottom. Then you're going to go like that. All right? Push it all the way down. I'm going to go around this. We're gonna get that white line right there. All right. You're doing it. Those skate maggots only have until the end of this week to come up with the money or we'll close them down for good. I've already started getting proposals from construction companies to tear that building down. We'll begin demolishing, soon. There's still time for them to pay their dues and keep the building. Wouldn't that affect your development plans? It's a lot of time wasted on something. Brad. We've got to do everything we can to stop that. I'll reach out to my connection at the NCPD. He'll help us make sure they don't get any money. Listen, Goe. You know that rat nest skate shop over on Central? Yeah, I know which one you're talking about. Well, they owe eviction dues and I want them gone. I'm willing to pay you whatever it takes to make sure that happens. Deal? Okay boss, you got a deal. All right. Dude, you killed it. You filmed it so sick, man. It's really great. Yo, who wants to go at the reigning champ? Dude, pass me the controller. That ass is glass. Let's see this. I don't know why you do this. Somebody tell me that we know where we're throwing this party at. Nervous Nancy, Tom's got at handled. Tell him. Yeah, dude. That homie, Jasper. He's got an underground spot on lock. It's low key. He throws parties there all the time. Okay. All right. But what about the beer, though? Like, I mean, we have to have something to sell. Ding, ding, ding. Tell our lucky gust what he won. No, homie Sheep, dude. He's got a wholesale link on kegs. It's easy. He's coming over later. I'm going to seal the deal. Back door style. Well, I guess it's time to party then. See, who's got this. Who's got it? Who's got it? Almost, man. Dude, you've got to step it up. Maybe next time. What's up, man? I really like this shape. Perfect. But saw the same board online for $15 less. Plus free grip. I know, but I can't really cut anymore off the price. I can't compete with that. But what I can give you is like a more personal experience. They can't do that online. I know, man. But money is a little tight. I appreciate it, though. Sure, man. I understand. See you next week. Yeah, I hope so. Take it easy. Thanks, bud. I heard the news about the shop, Dave. Sorry, man. After all these years, it's time for us to get your back, though. We got you. Thanks. Yeah, man. We're already working on a plan. Yeah. You guys have a plan? Oh, yeah. Tell him. Yeah. Dave, dude. We are throwing a huge party. How's the party going to help me out? Easy! We just charge them to come in and charge them for beer, too. Yeah, it's foolproof. It's like your debts are already repaid. That might work. But, you guys better not get in any trouble. Oh, no. Dave, my buddy Jasper, he's a professional promoter. We're all good. We're chilling. We got this, Dave. Yeah, we got you, man. Don't get in trouble. Uncle Dave! Katie, you made it! How was your trip? Good. Well, you know this little punk has already been bothering me about going to the park. I keep reminding him that the reason for this visit is so I can get some college credits out of the way. Hey, it's my trip, too. Yo, Uncle Dave, what board is this? This is our shop board. So this has a really great shape. I think you'd like it a lot. This is seven, seven five. This is your size too. It's perfect. Take it from the money mom left me. That's the last of your birthday money. Let's set it up. Thank you. Yo, nice camera. Oh, thanks. My uncle Dave is letting me take some pictures of the shop for a couple of weeks so I can get some college credits out of the way. Dope. Well, since you're in town. We're actually throwing a party tomorrow night to raise some money for the shop. It's 21 and up, but you should come. What do you mean, raise money for the shop? Well, the shop's not doing so hot right now. Really? Yeah. With all the mall shops popping up and online sales, Dave's losing money left and right. We're going to try to raise some money with this party and save the shop. God, he's been talking about this place since I was a kid. I had no idea. Yeah, I know. This place is our home. Well, I am down to help however I can. So send me the details. You got it. Beautiful. We'll see you there. We're going to skate. Oh dope. Okay. Bye. See you at the party. See you. Yeah. See you. Hey!

Can you hook it up? You know I got you, my brother. How many you need? - We need like seven. - At least seven. Damn. How many people y'all inviting? Oh, man. At least 100. Okay. Well if I do that, I'm gonna need an invitation. Done. Okay, cool. And we invited so many chicks for you to mack and you're not going to know what hit you. Cool. You bring the gals. I bring the kegs. Probably gonna wear these. Just need a price on them. Shif, for you, $50. I can do 50. I can do 50. Oh, easy dude. Thanks. So just meet us tomorrow night at the underground. With the kegs. Tomorrow night. Underground. I'm there. Thank you. See you, there. All right, man. Cool. Cool. It's on. Always and forever, My dude. Peace. Yo, what up Jasper? This place is amazing. You guys ready to party tonight? Does a cat have climbing gear? This might be one of the biggest parties we've ever thrown here. What about the cops? They won't shut us down will they? They have never given us any trouble before. We're straight. Dope. Because we needed to make a lot of money tonight, dude. I'm charging everybody that walks in these doors tonight. We're making them money and some. Yes. Let's get set up. Party's on. Sheep's in the back with the kegs. Let's go. Party boys. Thanks everybody for coming out tonight. This is for Dave. This is for the shop. So make sure you're going out getting some drinks and having a good time. Yeah. Dollamenu! This is to save Dave's shop. This is for Atmosphere. Dude, I think we made it. I think we did, man. I think we definitely nailed it. I think we're going to save this shop, man. If this doesn't redeem us, there's no hope. We got it. Yo, you want a shot? Oh, ya. Peel one back. No. A shot. You're fried, fool. A beverage. What about you? Oh, I'm so parched. I would love one. To Atmosphere! To Dave! Let's do this! Yeah. What do you got? I just stopped at my guy, John. And it's in the basement. You're sure? These dudes, they're good people. They're a little fried tonight. We're all turned up. But you'd like these guys on the normal. Good people. How long have you known them? Probably like, two years or something. Yeah. We all moved here around the same time. We met over at Atmosphere. That's really cool. Yeah. Dave kind of put me in position to meet some of like, what I'd call, my best friends. Yo, how much have we made tonight? We've got about 4K here. Pushing about 7K by the end of the night. No! You're nuts, Jasper. Dude, only you could pull this off. Hey, if it don't make money, it don't make sense. Hey, my man! Mission accomplished, fellas. Dude, yes! So Dave's shop is really important, huh? Yeah. It's like a little un-functional family of some sort. That's really cool. Yeah. Shoot. Here's to Dave. Or something. Cheers. Cheers. Oh, my God. You, okay? I'm golden. My bad. Chocolate milk got me caught up. Out passed the midway? Yes. Shut it down, now. All right. Get over there, now. Oh, shit. We got the federale on the horizon. Listen, I gotta meet my entourage, but you'll be golden. Right? I'll catch you a little later. Okay. We might just be 5000, already. The cops are here, man. - What? - What? Wait, where? Everywhere, man. We got to get out of here. Jasper grab the kegs. Grab the money. Yo, forget the kegs. There's way too many. Yo, where's everybody going? Y'all bolting? Fuck it. Get the cash. Let's go. Bail, dude. Come on, come on. Let's go. Let's go. Stop, right there! Stop, right there! Who's in charge of your little group here, huh? Huh? No one? Look, we didn't hurt anybody, dude. Call me dude, again! Ow, stop! And I will put you away for years! Do it again! Whoa, whoa. Sir.. Back up! Back up! Look, man. Take the money. - Let us go. - Jasper, no! Just take the money. You've gotta be kidding me. - Just take the money. - Are you serious? Let us go, you know? Jasper, no! I'm gonna take your money. If ever see you boys out here again, you are all going to jail. Understand?! Get up! All right. Loosen you. Ow. You boys have a good night. Guys, let's go. It's been a pleasure, fellas. Oh, hey guys. I heard what happened. Don't get in any trouble. We should be fine. But anything we're- We're just pissed, man. I mean, Dave, we were right there. We almost had like $5000, man. Oh, man. Well, I appreciate the effort. Now, Dave, we're going to come up with else. We're not out of ideas, yet. There's gotta be something we can do, though. If we just had that money, they couldn't touch us. Dude, there's gotta be a way around it. We're just missing it. Figure this out. Yeah. Huh? I'm missing one. Did you do it? Oh, yeah. We got a nice little donation for department, too. Good. Very good. Just stay on them until they're evicted. You can't take any chances. All right. Attention, all units. Make sure you stay on patrol around the skate shop, off Central. Thanks for calling Atmosphere. This is Jake. How may I help you? Hey, you got any soap shoes? Soap shoes? Uh, no. We don't carry soap shoes. I actually haven't seen soap shoes since the 90s. We do have DCs, though. I just got that, man. It's pretty nice. What are you doing? Give me that back. - Okay. No problem. - I thought it was candy. Maybe try somewhere else. Thanks, bye. Guys, do we have an idea yet? Yes, actually. Yo, check this out. What if we hold a car wash to raise money? That is a terrible idea, Tom. Tom, nobody wants your stank ass in their car. Well, what about this? I know a bunch of the local artists around here. I bet if I talked to them, I could get some of them to donate some art. Maybe set up a gallery? Could bring in some money. Yeah. That's a better idea. I know. Actually, it might work. Hey Dave, don't you know some gallery owners, downtown? Yeah. I can make some calls. Actually, I bet I could call Blazendary. He could bring some of his exclusive shoes, too. We raffle those off, maybe we could make more money that way. Some of the shots for my senior thesis are pretty cool. If you guys are down for it, I'd love to show some of them off. Let me go call him. Doesn't hurt. Right? Let's see if we can make it happen. Dave, we gonna put the word out man? Sure, man. With that hipster crowd, we got some money flowing in, hopefully. They got cash to spend. All right. But in the meantime, are you going to show me how this works, or what? Take notes. Oh, okay. Is that the new Andrew Lutheran promo - from Life Extention? - You know it is. Yo, what's up? Hello? Hello? Yo, right here. You see this empty hand? Pass me a bev. Yo, are you guys ready? Yo, Wake up! Dude, we gotta be at the art show at 10. Let's hit it. Come on. Dude. What time is it? We were skating until like two, last night. It's like nine. We gotta be there in an hour. Are Katie and those girls going to be there? Yeah, they'll be there. Tell me Jane's going to be in the mix. Yeah, she'll probably be there. I think we got something special in the making. All right Romeo, bring those roses. Let's go. Yo, Dollamenu. Wake up! Corduroy cowboy, you got time to crack my back? Yeah. So you're telling me these are used tennis shoes? Not used like that. Yo, what's up guys? Yo, what up G. How you doing, man? Dave, Blazendary. Blazendary, Dave. Nice to meet you. So you got the shoes? I got some special stuff here, man. I really think you're going to love it. Let's see this. What you think he got up in there? Oh. Right here, we have the Air Jordan One. Travis Scott. I love these ones, but another personal favorite would have to be the Nike Air Yeezy 2, Red October. Oh yeah, that's cool. I think them fake, man. We also got right here. Oh, no! The Air Jordan One, Chicago Python. Okay, he's peeked my interest. And my personal favorite, The Nike Mags. From the movie? Yeah. Really? That's amazing. Are you seeing this? That might have been before your time. We're the same age. With these amazing pairs, I hope we can get the money from the raffle tickets, split them and hopefully it's enough to save the shop. That's so very generous. Thank you so much. And guys, I'm going to go ahead and take a couple photos, real quick. Get this posted up all over social media. We'll try and get this place packed tonight. Huh? - All right. - Let's do this. Hey, well thanks for doing it. Of course. And I'll be back in a couple hours. Got some stuff to do. All right. Later guys. All right, man. - Take care. - Take it easy. Wow. That's incredible. That's insane. You know, he's still ain't following me back on Instagram. All right. How's this looking? Yeah. That'll be $50. $50? We don't really have $50 right now. Any potential of beauty like yourself could help out us good Samaritans? You know, like a good deed. That's really cute guys, but that's the rules. Company policy. Policy. We're throwing an art show to try to help raise money for the skate shop, off Central. They're getting evicted and they need all the help they can get. Skate shop on Central. Atmosphere? Yeah. Yeah. That's the one. My nephew loves that place. You bet. Okay guys. This one's on me. Don't tell anyone. And I hope you guys raise your money. You are an absolute legend, Louise. Thank you. Yeah. Get outta here. Thank you. Come on. Let's go. Oh. Yeah, catch up, man. Okay, okay. I'm gonna get in the lead, man. What are you talking about? Oh, baby. Definitely. Hey, Carol! I'm heading out for lunch. I'll hold your calls. The report are in and a building off Central should be ready. I've got to call you back. Hey, have a good one, man. You, too. Hey, what's up? Hey, Johnny. I need you to go to that skate shop downtown. They're having an event today to raffle shoes. I'll pay you anything you need to go mess them up and shut it down. I don't know, man. I've done a lot for you in the past, but this job sounds too risky. I don't care if it's risky! Name your price and get it done! Okay. Okay. I'll do it. Guys, come look at this. This is crazy. Whoa. Look at this turnout. This is actually working. This is definitely something I want to capture. Blazendary brought out the people. That should be definitely enough to save the shop. I've been waiting here all day for this. I'm going to buy 25 tickets and win those shoes. I can't believe they're giving away a pair of Nike Air Mags. Yeah. I heard they were going for like 20 grand, online. What's up guys? Hey what's up Jake? How are you? What's up, mate? Bam, thanks for coming. Yo. What's up bro? How you doing? Nice to see you, dude. Nice to see you, man. You ready for this? I'm ready, bro. It looks like an amazing turnout, for real. I can't thank you enough for putting the word out, dude. They're so excited. Absolutely, bro. I got you. I hate to say it, but I got to go hop on this plane real quick to New York for some business. But please send me some pictures of how the event goes out. And just please, bro. Take care of those shoes. Yeah. We got you. Even if I don't win the Air Mags, I'm cool with the Yeezy's, too. Those are going for like two grand. Wait. Is that Blazendary? Peace. We out. One at a time. Have your money out. There's no need to push, guys. Thank you. This is an embodiment of really everything that I see in the world and that I see as special in the world. I shoot a lot of concerts. I shoot a lot of drag queens. I'm want that one. That one? Oh, great. Hey, guys. We're going to run that raffle in like 10 minutes. So excited. All right! Can I get everybody to gather round? I just want to first of all, thank all of you for coming out. I'm really grateful. For every ticket that we have we put in here and we're going to raffle. So you've got a chance to win and with no further ado, let's spin this thing. Whose ready to upgrade their wardrobe? And for third place... A 7 3 2 Yes! There he is! Alright. It's getting hot in here. This is for the second place prize. Second place. It's for the artist Air Ones. The pythons. 7 2 9 1. The streets just got more styling. All right. This is the one that everybody's been waiting for. This is for the Air Mags. The ones from the movie. The original one. All right. This is what everybody wants. A 4 4 0. Thanks guys for coming out. Let's see what he won. Where are the shoes? Is this a joke? Uncle Dave, where'd you put them? I didn't do anything with them. What do you mean? Dave, they were right there, though man. Somebody had to of stolen them. So maybe we just check and see if maybe somebody saw something sketchy. Maybe if we just check their bags. Right? Are you serious? We can't do that. Are you seriously going to raid everyone's pockets? That's stupid, dude. All right. What are you going to do, call the cops? They already robbed us, once. Grandma? I don't think there's anything we can do at this point. We just cut them a refund and consider our losses. Dave! It's just not in the cards. Dude, we got robbed again. What are we going to do, man? This is all we got. Guys, please don't leave. I'm sure we'll find them. Wait, man. I don't care. Get out of my way. I don't know what happened. We can find the shoes, man. It's like a misunderstanding. Johnny? Johnny, are you here? - We can find the shoes. - Jane I'm sorry. Come on. Good morning. Good morning. How are you? Are these donations? Yes, they are. I hope they help someone in need. Me, too. Come one, Ollie. Man, that sucks. We had so much money in that raffle. We could have pulled it off. Straight up, dude. Dave, such a solid guy. He doesn't deserve this. You know guys, let's blow it off. Y'all try to skate. We came all the way out park. We moved all the way to the DIY. Is someone trying to get a clip? I got my camera. Not at all. Skate mojo is out the window, dude. I'm not feeling it, man. Jake, you need one more clip for your part. Let's get it. Tom. Come on, dude. I'm just bummed guys. Where are we going to go? Closest spot is like an hour out. That place is sus, dude. Straight up. I don't know about you guys but we've been riding for Dave for so long. I couldn't even picture us riding for another shop. This might be it. It's not really an option. Whatever, guys. I'm over it. If we're not going to skate, let's dip. Let's go, man. You good, Shawn? Slowly. Can you drop me off at Jane's? You should probably hit your brother up, dude. We probably need to start working if we're going to make rent, next week. All right, man. I'll text him tomorrow. We're up Shit's creek. Just polishing a turd at this point. But we'll bounce back, somehow. What's up, fellas? Why the long faces? Oh, nothing. Shawn here lost the family dog. Oh man. I'm sorry to hear that, Shawn. What can we do for you? I just want to stop by the shop. Bless you guys with some free boards and let you know about a contest we've got going on this weekend. Pays out ten grand and the winner gets a chance to try out for the Olympic team. Whoa. Ten, ten grand? Did you say the Olympics? Yeah, man. We've been doing a bunch of these contests up and down the east coast and I want to stop by and make sure we get the guys from your area. Heard there's a lot of good guys around here. We'll make it. Yeah. We'll be there. We'll get them out. This guy's actually putting a tape together, right now. Yeah? Killing it. Well put the link together and send it to me, man. I'm gonna get outta here and get back to the hotel. Thanks, man. Hope to see you guys this weekend. All right. Easy life. Enjoy that, Mike. Thanks, Mike. Later, guys. What? What do you think guys? That's crazy. Perfect timing. Right here, Tom. What?! You did that! You got to check this out. Dude, that was wild. I told you. Yes, sir. Tom with the angles. My man! That's the icing on the tape, man. With this video and if you win tomorrow, Mike is going to put you on for sure. No doubt. I don't know. We'll see, fellas. We'll see.

That's my boy! Hold on, I got to give this to Dave. Hold on. Ha, ha! My boy. And that's why you rep the shop. Thanks, Dave. But I can't take this, man. This is all for the shop. That's what this is for. I need this so much, too. I know. Look guys, I don't mean to interrupt. That was an amazing performance out there today. Thanks, man. I overheard you talking about the skate shop. I've actually been working for a developer who has been trying to shut you guys down. I used to skate when I was younger and I love what you guys are doing. So long story short, I got tired of seeing what he was trying to do to you guys. So I quit. And I'd like to talk to you about investing in the skate shop. Really? Dave, say yes. I don't know what to say. I mean, yes. Right on. Why don't you come by the shop tomorrow and we'll iron out the details. Sounds great. I'll do that. Dude. We did it, man. This is insane. Hey Jake, that was incredible. That was insane. Thanks, dude. I just watched your tape before the contest and it blew my mind, man. We're headed up to New York. Want to see if you want to jump in the van and get on this team? Get on this tour with us. Of course! Are you kidding? Yeah! Here's my card. We're leaving early in the morning. Don't miss it. Don't blow it. - Yeah. I'll be there. - Sounds awesome. All right, guys. Have a good night. Congratulations. See you, man. Dude, what is this?! Ah! See your dreams can come true. Brad just quit to invest into the skate shop. What do you mean he quit? He's investing in.. He did what?! I can't believe this. He went to help those maggots. Yes. Don't say anything else. Just go find me another property I can buy! Ah! There's your boy. Yo, guys. From Due Amici's to Atmosphere. Congratulations. And thanks for all your duds. Hey yo, let me get a slice. Dollamenu splurging tonight? Splurging? You already know what it do, baby. It's gluten-free, though. You know what I'm saying? I got to watch my complexion and my figure. Where's Shawn at? You didn't see him leave with Jane, earlier? What? They're like a full on item now. I'm talking about conjoined at the hip. At least the playboy finally scored. Jake, are you ready for your trip tomorrow? I couldn't be more ready than ever, Dave. I actually asked Mike if Tom could come shoot second angles. He said that he could. I'm fired up. I have every pair of underwear I own in my bag. So two pairs? I'm wearing one so one pair. It's me and you, dude. Let's get it. Road dogs. How about the homie Jasper got me a gig at the Premium Lounge. What? You know we had to get back on that money train, baby! Choo-choo! How did you pull that off? That place is wild. You've got to take us when we come back. You've got to take us. No. I'm just messing with you. It's party time, fellas. We're going to celebrate all the wins this season. Dave, you're invited, too. Count me in, fellas. Although, I haven't been to a club since like 1996. All right. Slices up, fellas. Celebrate this win for Atmosphere. We got the shop back, baby. Yeah, man, watch this. This thing doesn't even use megapixels. Hey, man, let me help you with that. Don't hurt yourself bending over, Dave. We are going to take him to the hospital. Ah! This morning, we're checking out for the steals and deals at the thrift. You guys already know this is one of my favorite spots to come hit. I mean, there's different things every day that could pop up. So, I'm honestly just going to try and find the best steals and deals like you usually do on the Blazendary Channel. I mean, Ooh, right here. We've got the Jordan features. All right, color way. These go for about maybe 15, 20 bucks. Get them for a good price. I wonder what they're going for. Leo, you spot anything good, man? I saw these Nike Cortez. I feel that we can put these up on eBay for like 10, 20 bucks. Oh, really? They're actually pretty nice. You have to get that Sharpie off, but the only thing. Bro, look at these. Bro, are these are the ones? Are, are these your Nike Air Mags? Oh my God. These are the ones. These are my size. These are the missing ones. Why are they here? Holy crap, bro. We got to get these right now. Come on, bring it. Let's go. Let's go.
