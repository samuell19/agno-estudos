You are an apple hanging from a branch and you feel the earth is calling you, softly. Make yourself comfortable. I'll tell you a story. You're the main character. You walk down the aisle of a big funfair You see a little hut and, inside, an old man with a long beard. Imagine the atmosphere, the sounds, colors and smells. Colorful balloons are hanging around him. You are intrigued, so you go inside to see him: Hello sir, what do you do? What do you offer? He gives you a sheet and asks you to note all your little problems. Those problems that can be encountered at home, in the street or perhaps at school. Once written, you take the sheet and fold it in half, then in half again and again and again. Then the old man, with his long beard, looks at you, smiling and tells you to choose a balloon. You take the balloon by the string at the end of the string you hang the paper that has become very small and now wraps up your words. You reach out to the sky and the balloon flies off gently. The little dot in the sky disappears. The balloon has disappeared, and at the same time my little problems have disappeared too into the big blue sky, the deep blue sky with lots of light and softly In the world, there is France, in France there is Paris, in Paris there is Belleville, in Belleville there is the neighborhood. I like Belleville, it's nice but very noisy. In Belleville there are fights, scams and sometimes, robberies. I love my neighborhood and I feel comfortable, I am free. I live in Belleville. I like Belleville for its bustling streets, its varied people, its colorful shops. Its sidewalks are sometimes full of dirt there are festivals throughout the day, it's a densely populated neighborhood. FROM ONE SCHOOL TO ANOTHER My neighborhood is not very colorful but I like it like that. It is calm and reassuring. Sometimes moody and cold or warm and beautiful but also very cool and pleasant. I think I'm lucky to live near the Luxembourg Gardens. I do not like this neighborhood because there is dog poop and pee. My neighborhood is historic and beautiful. It's a district of Paris. It's snobbish, there are not many children, it is not very open, people aren't either. My neighborhood, I love it and that's it! BELLEVILLE PRIMARY SCHOOL Who needed help at home to do this work? I got help from my father and my brother. A device used to wipe the windscreen. Wiper! Wiper, can you spell it. W. I. two P's. E. R. No! Uh P W then... Then P P No! Let her finish! W. I. P. E.

(in French) Because you can say a green skirt Because with the feminine, it becomes green, (verte) My name is Chainez, I am 9 and a half years old. I am a girl. I am from Algeria. I live in Paris, in Belleville. I have qualities and faults. My qualities are... I don't have the same qualities as the other children at school. I'm always kind to others and others are nice to me. And also when people brawl too. I separate them and I tell it to a master, and that There was a problem in the playground. I came to get you in the courtyard. Half of the pupils were not here and two classmates were crying. So I'd like to know why why there were those tears. Kudjeji. Me and the others were talking and then Chainez came to the bench. After, she came and told Sofia: Oh you, you don't have any friends, you come here and you squat with Samira and everybody. You don't even have a girlfriend. Now I would like to know why Sofia came back with tears. It's because I was on the bench. I was talking to Kudjeji and after that Anissa and Alice, they told me that I don't have any friends and also Chainez And now that I am friendless I play with Samira and everybody... And that's what hurt you? We were playing and then without meaning to, we bumped into Zohra. We didn't do it on purpose. We said we were sorry. Afterwards I was tired of saying sorry so she started to make problems. We said sorry, shut up! Speak kindly to your friends please! We said we were sorry, then Kudjeji began to say: we don't want you with us just because you beat us. We heard that. Now we stop. I think we can find a solution. Are there children in this class who have solutions? Let them all play together. And this means? That the problems are forgotten! And also that there is no girls' gang. Absolutely, because that's what is happening! Gangs. I am 9 years old child, I was born in 2001. My parents were born in China. I'm a 9th grader. I have two brothers. I like drawing. And then I don't know. My name is Kudjeji, lam not an animal or an object lam human. I am 9 years old, I'm a nice girl and I'm funny. I love playing with my friends. My favorite fruit is the strawberry and the vegetable I do not like is Brussel sprouts. A citizen during the Middle Ages, a city dweller Is it what you know about the definition of the word bourgeois? No, no. Anissa? This is someone who I do not know. I was not told. Wallid? A bourgeois is a person from the Middle Ages. An inhabitant So, in the Middle Ages, a bourgeois was an inhabitant of a town. Bourg, bourgeois is a word from the same family. Do you use it? No, no... Never? I've never used it. A cat No, a charter A charter also gives privileges to the citizens Yes, that's how the word evolved. At first, the middle-class people were the inhabitants of towns. But with different charters established in towns, well, some people were given privileges. What does this mean "privileges"? Kalidiatu? Some people... Oh, tell me, you are privileged There are people who are not attentive. For example, we let things go, it is given to someone else. We let things go, it is given to someone else? No! A privilege is when you have things that others do not have and it's often unfair. So with the various charters that were established, the term bourgeois evolved and now means a class of people that is called the bourgeoisie. The following definition. A neighborhood outside the city. A neighborhood outside the city. Can you show us a suburb on the map. I am lllias lam a boy who is often bored in life. Because I'm trying to find something to do and I can't find anything. So I read a book. I am Wallid, I am 9 years old, I live in France, I am from Morocco. I was born in 2001 and football is my favorite sport. Sometimes if someone respects me, I respect him and if someone does not respect me, I do not respect him. ST. JACQUES PRIMARY SCHOOL What are we doing in mathematics? By raising your hand please! Lia? Proportionality It's a bit barbaric, this word. What does proportionality means? What are we doing? What is a proportional situation? Fruit and sugar to make jam. To make jam what do you need? Give an example. Do you know it? Theo? Ajar of jam, we need 500g of fruit and 40g of sugar. So if we had 300g of fruit, we must find how many grams of sugar we need. You have 5 minutes to do that, try to do it quickly. You start at the margin of the note book. 2.50 and 2.50. 2 and 2, 4 it is And 50 cents and 50 cents? Equal 5 Yes, it's 5. I let you write it No, there it is, 10! No, no! We multiply by two, then we add 2.50 and we add 2.50, 2.50, 2.50, 2.50 and 5 are added and we add 12.50 My name is Solal, I live on a planet, I have a very, very nice life. What can we say? I have a lot of friends I am somebody. Sometimes I get upset quickly. Sometimes in class. I gaze at the ceiling. Sometimes I for example, if somebody makes a joke, well I'm offended, well, I almost begin to cry. I like to annoy people. I do not know how to explain it I cry quickly, with emotion. I am a piece of dust compared to the earth or the universe or I'm uh I have a soul, I am a soul covered with a corporal envelope. Or, I am an overdeveloped animal. More developed, which is the cousin of the monkey. I am going to distribute two pages which is a synthesis of the Middle Ages and the different families of kings. Each one is going to have a sheet. You can work on it with a partner and you can help and get help from whoever you want except the teachers. Look, there's a list here. The answers are written on the sheet so it's easier! We just must color and then Well, I don't know the answer of some questions but there are some questions to which I know the answer. His name is Louis XIV, but they also say the Sun King! The other one I think He was crowned in 800 well it's Charlemagne! Is the kingdom of France necessarily limited to that territory? No At one point there may be lands that belonged to the English I do not really like History so it will be quite complicated. I am a person who is 9 years old. And I love to go to school and when I grow up I will be a schoolmistress And I play the piano. I have classes on Monday. I'm learning music theory. I prefer music theory to piano because when you play the piano you're all alone whereas in music theory there are more and we do lots of different things. Every Wednesday I go to catechism. I am a Christian. I am a pupil, I am a child. I'm the son of Jean and Claire Levy. Ambroise Levy's brother. The grand son of Solomon Levy and Jacqueline Levy and of Jacques and Jacqueline Lelouche. I am the nephew of uncle Uncle David Uncle Eli and Frédérique Lelouche. And that's all. I'm smart enough, always in a hurry to do everything. I'm very greedy- Always willing to help my friends. When we ask this question, we believe that we are somebody but in the end we don't really know. Oh great, I got a 17! You got a 17! 16.5 It's the same as me because I got 16.5! I know all my multiplication tables. But I also know them! Well, stop arguing? They compete 24h/24 and 7 days out of 7! Even about Harry Potter. Tom, are you happy with your grades? Loreilay, are you pleased with your grades? I got 19 out of 20! I'm not saying vote for me all the time like Tom. I said, for example, improve things, but there are others who just say vote for me! I suggested box to put one's ideas on a piece of paper. Tom, what did you say? For me it was to improve relations with adults at school. Oh, it's true! To help others. Most importantly, you were the only boy to make a serious speech so When someone says something and you do not agree with it, you have to say so. If he says, go and tell the lady that she is stupid? No, but if you say, for example... Even if you do not like what he said, you're going to say so? No, but if he proposes something and you do not agree, but it's a good idea anyway, well you still have to say it. But if you do not agree it's because you think it is not a good idea. But it can be a good idea even if you think it's not a good idea. I told them I want to be a delegate because it's good. Okay. lllias, why do you want to be a delegate? Because it's better than being normal. If you are a delegate then you're someone important. Did you prepare a program? No No? So, why do you think people are going to vote for you? Because maybe they want me to be their delegate. Why should we take you and not someone else? Because they think I'm much better than others. So what is a delegate? In the playground there are people who fight, we are the ones who have to separate them. I'm a little upset! OCTOBER Impressions after the first meeting Our meeting with the pupils of St Jacques middle school was a bit unpleasant. Because we came into their class and we played a little in the yard and everyone asked us, "What class are you in?" "Where do you go to school?" "What's your name?" Everyone was curious. There was a 5th grader. I told him that my name was Lamine, he told me that I was Bin Laden! So I yelled at him, I told him that my name was Lamine and not Bin Laden. But he was talking barbaric. He says Bin Laden every time. Do you know who Bin Laden is'? I know that he's Arab but he's a drug trafficker of weapons I believe. In St Jacques middle school, there are not many black people, and Chinese and Arabs. There are only white people or mixed people, this is normal. I do not like it. I wonder why there are no blacks, Chinese Because in our school it's mixed and in their school it is not. As soon as I finished my lunch, I went into the playground. Cyril and I were talking with people. Then many pupils asked us if we were new or not. But we noticed we were the only Chinese. For example, if there's a club of 5, they will not interact with other people, they stick in one place. They don't speak with others. And it's weird, here we talk with everyone. They were very smart. As soon as we arrived they came to say hello and to tell us their names. Why do you say smart? Because they are smart. They come to people even though they don't know them. Pupils from Belleville were nice, I think I even made a friend but I do not know her name. I played cards with her and other kids of my class and it seemed odd because they were not many. I think they were 18, 16 and And they were different, there was only one white girl in their class and therefore It was weird because it was not that far. What do you mean by it was not that far? Our school and their school... You mean geographically? Yes! I was with my classmates, there were pupils from Belleville near us. Some of them are very nice but one of them insulted my friend. There are one or two I didn't like. But what did he say? What? What insult did he say? Well he said a dirty word, I can't repeat it since it's a bad one! A bad one! Otherwise they were very friendly, a boy even gave me some of his chips, but I gave him some of mine too! At first I thought they were mean because they told me I was a peacock with glasses But then we got on well in the playground after the picnic. We had fun. We were going into the library section to pick up a book and they told us: go away, this is our space, or otherwise Well that's it! I found it was not very nice except with a few who were fun. With Sarah and Lia, we wanted to be friends with a girl from Belleville and we asked her to picnic with us and she said, no I'm fine. And after, she went to see her friends and I went to throw my paper away and I heard her say that we were asses! I came to see a pupil from Belleville, I will not describe him to you. I asked him how things are going and he told me Have I the right to say bad words? Fuck you, son of a bitch. Yes, this is a very very bad word. Did it shock you? A little bit but I think we should meet with other people in this class. Some of them were playing cards, then we came to play with them. But they didn't want to because some of them had been threatened. But they are in our school, we can still try to be nice. DECEMBER - National Dance Theater Rehearsals for end of year show Today you are at the National Dance Center. You are going to spend all day here, you will picnic here and we will make two groups in which there will be pupils from both schools. One group is going to work with Jean-Philippe Costes Muscat, it's an introductory workshop in dance and movement. Once you have put down your bag and your coat, you are going to move around the room, and I will ask you to observe everything that is in the room, and record it. Is that ok? Let yourself be touched by all the images around you. There are still images fixed things, and moving things. I don't know if we can say things More and faster Open your arms... And at one point, you will walk so fast that you will start to run! You are going to accelerate and accelerate and then progressively you are going to slow down until you stop altogether, but take your time. The movements must be jerky, but at times they can be continuous. Keep in touch, stop moving! Do not move. Look into the eyes, do not move. Do not move. 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 It's not easy because you are far away. Open your hands, so you can separate... Yeah, great. I told you to do it like me, the movement, you are like little parrots... look at the studio, the others And we stop. Great! Very nice. Did you look at each other a little bit? It already creates great dances. I saw many beautiful things. What does it mean, infinite? Infinite, it is a sign. There is indeed a sign for infinity. But what does it mean, Steven? It never stops. It never ends! It's like that, And speaking of infinitely large or infinitely small? Infinitely big! Only? In fact both are true. It means there is less infinite and infinite. It's not really what it means There's infinity 1, Infinity 2, Infinity 18 No... There's infinite time Yes! No numbers, they never stop? Between two decimals numbers, between 1.2 and 1.3, can I add another number? No Yes Yes, for example 1.21, and 1.22 And between 1.21 and 1.22 can I add another number? No. Yes I can! I can always insert a number, to infinity! And you have met the other class, from Saint-Jacques? Yes So how is it now? Well Tell me a little bit more Yes! Some have made friends, I too have made friends, and the project, it's better with them than without them. Before they were not very nice, but I think they felt like us, at the same time it was normal... each was in a different environment. For example, for the Belleville school, they did not know our school at all, but we know it so we were more comfortable But then at the Dance Center, they were super nice! I even made a friend ! It went very well, I made friends too. The boys did not speak much, they spoke with other boys, but I don't know They were more friendly. Last time at the movies, some people were saying that they were not nice, but you never know eh This is not because they told us we were peacocks with glasses that they are not nice. Were you able to have contact with some of the children of Saint-Jacques? I had contact only when we played. We played at the workshop, and after it was After it was funny. Doing a show at the end of the year, how do you feel about that? Nothing. Normally, I think they were... like that then they thought we were intruders, they insulted us, they were mean. Then I realized that all they wanted was to have friends. Go over there Chris-to-phe! So-la-l! So-la-l! Re-do the end. Just the end, just the movement. It was good. You really became aware of what you were doing. You see it's not that easy to always repeat the same movements. Well it was okay! Okay, it's not the problem, but it's not so easy to do the same thing. And especially because what I see is I don't see you stopping. I don't see you stopping. It's funny, there's always a hand that can't stop moving. I know someone else... who spends his time moving his hands Facing the public An-tou-ane! Li-a! This is a freeze, eh Continue! You continue until you see it. Are we walking like this, with hands in front like that? No. The hands do not work like that. They hang down. That's it. Ok, this time it's good. Do not pull! Get closer! We all make a step. Hop. That's it. Chris-tophe! Sa-mi-ra! Hush, and stop moving. Wait Do the same thing Samira, but much louder. Great. JANUARY And so here, inside the body, l filled it with paper. Without the tape, I ripped and stuck it with white glue, ordinary glue. And this, here, let me show you, I'm using it to paste it in the street. So what I do is called street art. I cover a wall that is all gray, a door that is condemned, closed, I use the space in the streets, in the city without permission, but Don't you look a bit weird when you go into the street and you paste something? No, I look completely normal. No, but you come like that with your glue, you paste and you Yes, exactly. In the street, how many things like that do you put UP? Well I don't do it every day, but But I can paste 1 or 3, 4, 5. How much do you earn? Because if you do it in the street If l do it in the street, I'm not paid to do it. I earn nothing. It's just a free act, and This is just to share my work. I see one every Wednesday... That one. Me too! The one in Rue Mouffetard is near my house! It's close to my mother's house. What is the point of sticking these in the streets? To decorate! To make the streets look nicer and to make people happy in their city. The fat lady is your favorite. It looks like a painting by Botero, who makes big women like that... In Barcelona he made a big horse! A big horse! He is truly amazing, Yes because it is original. And I like it. And we saw many in the streets, and we did not really know it was him. There's a problem Because tags... are not allowed, because it messes up the walls, but that, it can also damage the wall! I'd say it would inspire other people to make inspirations and motivate others to do the same, and do many more things like that... and moreover, it's beautiful! Very, very nice! Okay, we can't earn a living by doing it, but it's art, this is pure art! Pure art that we exhibit! It is as if the city was a museum! A great museum! What is happening? I don't understand anything at all. What don't you understand? I have zero out of 10 for that Zero what? Zero out of 10 for that Well maybe Franck is going to re-explain! What don't you understand? The sticking and things that you explained earlier... Look, if we take the head there. Stop! Look, I take the head there, I press what I want to tear, and then I pull it! There. Thank you! It's so beautiful! This is to beautify places where it is a little dark... where there is no color! If you put too much paper on the tape, it no longer sticks. Yeah I did it! I know how to say Amine in Arabic, it is Amina. Rubbish! Is it true that Martin in Arabic is Martina? No, rubbish! The other class is not there? We are going to do a little bit of "kecak" before the others arrive. Let's see if they are here because a class is coming to visit us Listen to me, I'll do it all alone. My grandparents took a sheep skin to sit on Yes My name is Bastien lam eight years old and I am small. What are you? Did you hear the end of his sentence? No, you know it, but can you hear it? Come on, louder My name is Bastien lam eight years old and I'm small. I am kind and generous My grand mother makes jewelry I do not like sport, but I like everything else I'm plasticine, thin and red. Yes, very good I have brown hair Yes, that's right lam made of a soft beige layer... lam made of a soft beige layer... A soft beige layer? Oh, not bad Maybe they chose me in this crazy and sometimes wonderful world, I don't know. Now we'll do the same thing, we'll do it all together and we will do it in an operatic way. My parents kept some cows in Italy My favorite thing is geography My father works in a medicine factory Yeah well, Ilias My grandparents took the sheep skin to sit on I do not like sport but I like everything else Yes, it is great Lasagna is my favorite dish Parents taking a sheep skin for sitting I would like to hear Sophia, I would like to hear Anissa, I would like to hear Steven. MAY So here we have the title. What else do we have? Come on, let's try. It's a film by Wim Wenders for Pina Bausch. In your opinion, where is the... At the very top. So I'll give you a hint: This film was not done in her lifetime, it was done later. When she died. But why? To honor her. Ah, good it's a... Tribute. To make memories, to have memories... If you watch a movie, you, Lia? I'd rather see a documentary on her life, how she dances. And is it incompatible? Do the words 'film' and 'documentary' not go together? It's not a story that was invented, it's her real life. Now we will look at this sentence. I would like you to suggest a way to read it. Zohra? Dance, dance, otherwise we are lost. Dance, dance, otherwise we are lost. Dance, dance, otherwise we are lost. Dance, dance, otherwise we are lost. Dance, dance, otherwise we are lost. Dance, dance, otherwise we are lost. Dance, dance, otherwise we are lost. Can I do it with the movement? You may, yes. Dance, dance, otherwise we are lost! But I would have liked you to do it in front of me! Dance, DANCE otherwise we are lost! You will write three words about the idea of dancing. What is dancing for you? Three words. What do we think? Anissa Yes, what you think. Dancing. What are the words that you wrote? Movement. Go on. Energy. Energy. Happiness. Happiness. Expressing oneself Free Cool. Awesome? Body The beauty, the beauty, the beauty. Running, well. Well? Music Rhythm Bewitched, dreaming and love Love... Suppleness Openness Stretching Excitement Lovers Fast Slow Can someone read these words? Loud and clear, so we can hear them! Go Walid! Movement, energy, happiness, music, joy, interest, desire, rhythm, beautiful, lightweight, activity, fun, art, energy, moving through, run, fun, funny, well choreographed, laugh, dream, excitement, love, lovers, bewitched, fast, slow, dreaming, rejoice, openness, mood, hope, thinking, happiness, imagine, entertainment. And now we will look at the second part of the sentence: otherwise we are lost. What does being lost remind you of? Solitude Despair Lonely Concern Isolated Lost, no more hope. Missed, finished, the end Sad. Unhappy Uh, I don't mean unhappy. Unhappiness, buggered. Panic, anxiety, escape. Disorganized, closed, and to have problems. Dance, dance, otherwise we are lost. Do you agree with this sentence? Yes. Completely. Well, why? If nobody dances, the world would perhaps be unhappy. Imagine there's nobody dancing, and there is no more entertainment, well I do not know how to say it, life is not as good if nobody dances. To speak up. There are not only the movements, and so, if there is no more dancing, you can still communicate, we can still express ourselves. The little white spots you see next to her, are maybe if we do not dance, it can be the hope of thousands of people dancing which goes away Without words, just with the heart, just with the body. Many of you have asked what you are going to wear on the day of the show. So we have talked with Christophe and the children of St. Jacques and those of Belleville. Whether you're a girl or a boy, you're going to wear a white shirt and black pants. Or, if the girls prefer, black skirts. Steven, can you show us your white shirt, because you did great today, you came with a white shirt. That's exactly what you need to wear. Who does not have a white shirt? One, two, three, four, five, six. Miss, I do not know. I also do not know. Miss, I have one, but it has stripes. And I will lead from there. Okay? JUNE - The day before the show. I will be here to direct you. And not I would not like to see that. No no, that it is not a slow tempo, that's a fast tempo and it must be very very slow. Off, ok? Light off. That means turning off the lights. Your feet must be parallel. Here we go! Walid Alex No. He says 'Walid', it's as if he called you. You turn, you watch, and you come back. Have you forgotten? Walid Alex Clemence Really together! Yes, not bad, huh? Once again. Walid, you do not have your hands like that! Wait for silence. Please, some are working here. What? What what? But what? What what? But then what is he? What what what what is there? What what's there there's me! There was that? There was me! There was that? There was me me! There was that? There was me me me! Who me? Me me me what! But who me me me what? But what to me, me! But what have you there? There is that there is me and you ask what there is there, as if it was not me. Is that it? You're not here for nothing. But I do not know who that is here. That's what I'm saying, what what, what what is there. Ahhh! it's just that. There is that there is myself, there's that there is, there's that that, there's that, there's me, Ilias. And me actually, I have stage fright, as I am a little shy, so I did not want to show myself in front of everyone, so... Me, it's about the same. I'm pretty stressed out, because it's weird to do group work with pupils who are not in our school, so, uh it's weird. And we are stressed out. It's my turn! And I have stage fright, because this is the first time I go on stage, everyone looks at me, so I'm afraid. Me too, it's the same. I'm not stressed. I'm afraid for tomorrow, but now I'm fine, I saw the room, but, tomorrow, in front of about two hundred and fifty people, it will be a little bit scary. I'm not afraid because I have my friends. So with my friends, I have no stage fright. Anyway, I am never nervous. That's the idea. You'll be standing between them. Oh no! Oh no! If you could not film us, I think it would be nice. I only film your faces How are you? Try not to disturb them. Thank you boys. Sophia and Mary, you are well placed because they are positioned according to you. Everybody look. This means the musicians. Okay? If I do this, it means I'm talking to the musicians. If you see tickling, it's not for you. Where will he be placed on stage? He will be at the microphone. We'll do it once again. Mano will play. So you let him play first, you listen, and then you adapt yourself. That day was amazing. A tsunami arrived in the canteen and threw crumbed fish on our plates... Then we went to the cinema with our schoolmistress. But a cannibal came and he said to the schoolmistress: "you are so beautiful I could eat you," and he ate her! But as I was so hungry, I ate the cannibal. And then you can do the cannibal facing the public. Go ahead! Facing the public, it's really your big moment, cannibal! But, as I was... very hungry... Take your time. Go ahead. But, as I was so hungry, I ate the cannibal! And there he will follow you, okay? So can we try again? And he ate her! But, as I was so hungry, I ate the cannibal! Separate the last four syllables. You go down. You count to three. You go down all together. When I give the count, one, two, three, I get up. Is that clear? And once you are up, the ends of the line go behind, and you recreate a line. It will not necessarily be in the same order, but whatever. Attention. Please, hold on tight. I learned to go to the children that I did not know, who were not like me. I learned to listen to them. The Soundpainting helped me to speak loudly, to not be ashamed, and have a better voice projection. Everything changed with my sisters. Because before I did the Soundpainting, I was always fighting, all the time. And now, when they annoy me, I tell them to stop or do something calmer than that. Me, I became a new Lamine. How is this new Lamine? Well, I "discovers" another force, the new force that I have discovered is the force of no longer being in despair. It has taught me to be calm, it taught me other things, it taught me to listen to others. My best memory of this year is the friendships that have been invented. Sometimes I did not like school. I only came for playtime. But then, this year I really came to do the Soundpainting, because I liked it. Well I feel good. I feel stronger. In what sense? In my knowledge... because I learned a lot. He has changed a bit maybe. So what has changed about you? I met new people, I expanded my knowledge. Maybe I'm blooming? Yes, before I did not speak much, and now l speak a little bit more. Before, l was jumping everywhere, I'm an active girl and all that. Now I'm active, but I'm calm. Christophe and Marina kept telling me, Let yourself go. Afterwards I did let myself go. Before I was very shy, but now I'm almost not shy. We don't have years like this every year. I got to know pupils from Belleville that I only saw in the street, I wouldn't necessarily pay attention to them. Here it is the fifth arrondissement. There are many people who are not like the people in Belleville. And thanks to the Soundpainting, with Christophe, Pascale the schoolmistress, and everyone, I made new friends. What I see with the Belleville school is that they are not at all like us. For example, when I ask for some chips here, they say, "I won't give you any" or "I'll give you only half a one." The Belleville children gave me a handful of chips. We wish you all a good appetite and if you want to exchange with each other you can. Try whispering. I do not know if you know, but there is a tradition in entertainment before a performance, they say a word you are not allowed to say. They say "shit" to the actors, and I can even tell you where it came from because ah, you know? There were horse carts which came to the theater, and the horse waited outside. The horses. The horses pooped. If there were a lot of people at the end it was full of shit. So people said, "Shit" to wish that a lot of people came to see the show. So "shit" tonight!

Thank you. And can you tell me yours? Can you tear off a piece of paper for me? OK, OK I wanted to say to all of you children, realize your dreams. This experience and this film exist because of the will and benevolent involvement of the people who created them in order to repair (a little) the problem of social mixing which is a reality of school zoning.
