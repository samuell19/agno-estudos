"Miami, Florida, United States of America" In effect, we have gained ground and our plans are progressing. but we have yet to reach the objective. We have lost our best members. And all our plans have been neutralized by traitors. They have made us use violence. But with weapons and blood we will never triumph. our struggle has to be cold and effective. Before, we had inferior numbers, But now, we superate them, with millions of allies. They are invisible, silent and loyal. and our next project, once initiated, will not be stopped. now you will get to know them. It is a virus. one of the three members I will mention, is a traitor but he or she will never be again. Number 36 Number 143 Number 380 would you like to toast to our success? What is the matter? Is there one of you with doubts? you may return to your places. The virus is born, grows, and reproduces in 48 hours. during this time, they are harmless. but once developed, they are indestructible by any known means. however, when deemed necessary, we can control and destroy them. we will plant the virus. we will poison the water sources of the chosen countries. and in 48 hours, all the water will be contaminated. one week later, the terrain will be open for our direct intervention, and absolute control. Our lab is working on the preparation of the virus. He was the traitor, who warned our enemies, in the failed Ecuador mission. now we are sure, that our new allies, will not betray us.
