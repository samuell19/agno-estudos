Humans think they top the food chain, but certain creatures hunt humans for food. In Tokyo, their existence has long been acknowledged. They have come to be called "ghouls," and are regarded as a lurking threat. The government-formed Commission of Counter Ghoul has exterminated many of them. However, ghouls continue to exist, amid the shadows of Tokyo. Kaneki. Check this out. Until now, Ward 20's been relatively free of ghoul activity. That's pretty close. Behind the university street. Ghouls, huh? You'd get eaten in no time. You like weird books too. Try reading sometime. No way. I'd fall asleep inside five seconds. Your egg sandwich. Hey Hide. Ever seen a ghoul? Nope. But I hear they look human. There could be one close by. Close by, huh? What if I was a ghoul? Dial it down. What if there is one here? Hello. She's here! Ask her out today. T-Tomorrow's b-better. What's better? It's just better. Today's just as good. Go for it. O-Once I finish this book. Reading's bad for you! Hide! Stop, dammit! I-I'm sorry. Great author. Sen Takatsuki. Y-Yeah! "Egg of the Black Goat" "Date with Rize" I like her "Egg of the Black Goat," and her debut "Dear Kafka." That letter trick made me shout out loud on my own. And her short story collections. Like "Monochrome Rainbow," that inspired "Egg of the Black Goat." You sure are a big fan. All this book talk is boring you. No Kaneki, I just want to get to know you better. So do I. Kaneki? Here. You've got meat on you. Other side! Sorry! You're funny, Kaneki. You're not eating? I've been overdoing it lately. Light eater? I wouldn't say that. People say I eat too much. Mean, right? It is. Touka, you never eat anything. You're very quiet. Yeah. I like walking quietly. Kaneki? Yeah? I... knew. "That you were always... watching me." I was... ...watching you too. Wow, you taste great! There's a scene I love in "Egg of the Black Goat." When the Black Goat totally rips out a fleeing man's entrails. No matter how many times I read it, it gets my juices flowing. First time seeing a real ghoul? Help me! Help me! Help me! Wow, what a wonderful scream. I love it. Somebody help... Caught you. No, not yet! Dead flesh doesn't taste as good. Hang in there. Why... Why me? "Tokyo Ghoul" Ken? You're still up? What does this say? You read difficult books. Dad always read them. Where? Here. She died from overwork. What a shock. I'm hungry. Poor kid. Don't worry. It all went well. I felt it was my duty as a doctor to save the life in front of me. This guided my decision. I take full responsibility. You didn't confirm if she consented to organ donation. You can't get away with transplanting her organs arbitrarily. As I stated before, she was already dead when she was brought in, so we couldn't confirm her consent. We came all the way to Ward 20. What a waste. Mado, he doesn't have a mask on him. Amon. Here. When you're done, remove the kagune and kakuhou. It'll make a fascinating quinque. Luck's on our side, Amon. No. 696, aka Tajima and Serisawa. Real name Asaki Fueguchi. Killed a cop in Ward 13. Came to the 20th a year ago. The ring he left behind was order-made. Two were ordered in different sizes. The other ring must belong to his wife. Not his wife, his breeding mate. What does she look like? We checked No. 696's belongings, but he had no photo of her. If he'd had one, we wouldn't be at this meeting. We'd be out exterminating her. The only clue is... ...a fiber attached to his t-shirt. Excuse me. I'm Ward 20 agent Kusaba. No need for niceties. If we assume No. 696 does have a wife, isn't it a bit hasty to presume she's a ghoul? Could you love this? Precaution is necessary when dealing with ghouls. Kaneki! Here. I took notes for you. Three weeks worth of Asian History. Thanks. Okay, time to celebrate! Where? Big Girl! Here I go! Yum! Eat yours. I wanted to come with you once you got out. I've been holding off. Aren't I a good friend? Your doctor's getting majorly slammed. But that girl had no family at all. She died almost instantly too. Don't let it get to you. Eat up and cheer up. Oh yeah. I just joined a circle. They plan events and stuff. If you wanna join... Kaneki! You okay? Are you alright?! I'll get a cloth! Mr. Ogura, tell us again. Why is it that ghouls can't eat food like humans do? That's because their tongues work completely differently. Could you eat the organs of a living human? You couldn't. It's the same thing. Basically, ghouls can only gain nutrition from humans. This is said to be due to a special enzyme. Normal food tastes terrible to them. Salads taste acrid, and meat and fish are unbearably putrid. They try to hide it, and eat them around humans, but it makes them want to vomit. You're sounding like a ghoul. No, I simply know ghouls better than they know themselves. Food! "I smell it! Food! Food!" Don't scare me like that! I thought you were human. What is it? You're hungry? Don't hold back. He tastes as bad as he looks, but food's food. Wham. Stay out of others' territory. Friend of yours? This is my feeding ground. Feeding ground? Hey. Having my territory violated really pisses me off. Whose territory? Touka? That greedy bitch Rize died. Until she came, this was my feeding ground. Anteiku governs Ward 20 feeding grounds. "Anteiku"? Four-eyed asshole. Want some? You... I saw you with Rize... What are you? I've identified the fiber. Where's it sold? Er, well... It's French in origin, but I don't know where it's sold in Japan... Let's go. A ghoul killed his parents. Poor kid. Right in front of him... Amon. We'll trace the dress fiber. Sleeping well? Let your past haunt you. It's what makes us strong. Please help me. We're closed, sir. Hey! I'm begging you. You're my only hope. Do you... ...have any food I can eat? Food you can eat? You know what that is. Get it yourself. I just can't do that. Please. Please, help me. Ever since I became like this, my life's a living hell. I remember the news now. It was you who received Rize's organs. Tell me. What does this cake taste like? Or doughnuts? Or tarts? Chocolate? Orange juice? Strawberries? Melons? Pasta? Curry rice? Tell me. You were human, weren't you? That's enough. Boss? Helping other ghouls... is Anteiku policy. "Anteiku" Hinami. I'm sorry. That's our Anteiku blend. It's delicious. Don't cry, dumbass. I'm sorry. We ghouls are somehow able to drink coffee. It helps to quell our hunger. But before long, you'll crave something more. "We ghouls"? Thank you. Much appreciated. Oh, that reminds me. Here's some for you too. The agony of a ghoul's hunger is incomparable to that of humans. Kaneki! You still alive? I know you're there. Hey. "I need a favor at university. Here's payment. From Hide" How can I help? How many have you sold? Um, seven in the last six months. We need your security footage. Did a ghoul really buy clothes here? Confirming that is our job as CCG agents. That's so scary. Please exterminate it soon. Yes. We will. Huh?! An eye infection? I thought you starved to death. I'll stick to you like glue today. What's wrong? Oh, nothing. So, you wanted a favor? You've gotta join my circle. Please dude, I mean it. We need somebody to organize data. If I make a miscalculation, my senior... ...will chew me out! His name's Nishio. He'll be here. Coming in! Oh crap! What? Hey Nagachika. There are two things I hate. Know them? Bell peppers and... shiitake mushrooms? 1: Having my territory violated. 2: Stupid juniors who don't knock before entering. - Sorry. - And shiitake. Oh yeah! This is for you. It'll go with your coffee. Thank you. Taiyaki? Yeah. Who's he? He's the friend I told you about. Kaneki. How do... you do? Pharmacy sophomore Nishiki Nishio. Nice to meet you. Amon, want to grab a bite? I know a great noodle place. Sorry. So Kaneki, how long have you known Nagachika? Since elementary school, when Hide transferred in. How come you've stuck together? He was always shy... I didn't ask you. Sorry. In Year 2, I always sat alone and read books at recess. He was the first to talk to me. We've been friends since. So, you figured it's time to end it? Hey, let's go eat. "Good idea. Let's eat." Hide! Man, that was foul. Like eating horse shit. You brought him here to eat him, right? I mean, how many years have you waited? No... You're wrong! Really? Then I'll have him. Don't do it! You should've said that before! You stink. Just like a female ghoul. There's always been a rule... ...that food goes to the strongest. Are you kidding me? Don't tell me... ...you make friends with food? Hide... This guy gives me the creeps. Go on. Die. Okay okay! I take it back! I'm sorry! Hey! Hey! Calm down, dude! I wasn't thinking right. I was so hungry I couldn't help myself. Rize... Rize stole my feeding ground, so it's been a month. You're a ghoul too. You understand. Hide! Hide! Hide! Hide! Hide! Hide! Mr. Yoshimura sent us for him? I'm so sick of this. I'm... Be thankful to Touka and Yomo. Yomo? Better watch yourself. Nishiki's gone, but he could try to get revenge at any time. There's only one way for a ghoul to satisfy their hunger. Hide... Relax. We took him to hospital. He's still unconscious. Hide! Don't go! But... Don't go near him ever again. Hide is... the only friend I've got! You tried to eat your friend, didn't you? I don't understand. I just don't understand. What the hell am I? Kaneki, you're the only one who can exist in the worlds of both ghouls and humans. Come work at Anteiku. Here, you can learn the ways of our world. Found it? Five women in Ward 20 who bought that dress wore a ring. Facial recognition? In progress. Isn't this woman's dress too small? "Size XS" There might be another one. A baby rat. Slowly now. Don't rush it. Like writing the character "no." Rush a little. Hey, you like Sen Takatsuki? Hinami. I'm sorry. No, I am. Hinami... has no friends. I can't send her to school. Thank you. Hinami. I can't believe they're ghouls. What about me? And Mr. Yoshimura? And Touka? We all look like ghouls? No. Okay then, what about her? Is she human? I'm afraid not. "That person, and that person, and that person," and everyone else here are ghouls. This cafe's like a sanctuary for ghouls in Ward 20. But you get human customers too, right? To survive in the human world, we need to study them up close. Anyway, I like them. Humans. But... to survive, you have to... Er, Yomo? What are we doing out here? Hold this. Okay. Few people know about this place because we clear it. The people at Anteiku use suicide victims... ...as ...food? You think ghouls like the Fueguchis can hunt? Hello. Hell... Yoriko? Why are you here? Here. I made this for you. Wow. It looks delicious. Try some. I'm working now, but I will later. Right. Sorry. It's yummy! I know! What's in this? A secret ingredient? Oyster sauce! Of course. I thought so. Try the meat too! That looks tasty. Can I try some too? Like hell you can. Get coffee beans from upstairs. Hinami, can I come in? Sorry I startled you. I wasn't expecting you. This really is wrong, isn't it? Stay down! Stay down! For the last month, new doves have been hovering. "Doves"? From CCG. Commission of Counter Ghoul agents. Seems they came from HQ to hunt your late husband, and you two. Then... My husband was killed by... Let's shelter them here. Until we find you a new home, you must not leave here. To be safe, we'll take shifts staying here. Yomo, you find them a new home. I know somewhere in Ward 24. Ward 24? That hellhole? Doves can't enter there easily. I'll be fine. As long as I'm with Mom. Um... Is there anything I can do to help? Quit acting suspiciously. What? Er, nothing. Uta? Uta? Hello Touka. You've got an odd scent. Name's Kaneki. He was human... Mr. Yoshimura told me. Sit here. I'll measure your size. My s-size? Got allergies? Like to rubber, or metal. N-Not r-really... It'll be your first, so better a half mask than a full one. Mask? I'll take this off. You're hungry. Want one of these? No, I-I'm fine for now... Yeah? You're missing out. Um, excuse me. What am I here for exactly? They didn't tell you? I'm making your ghoul face. One of the five seems suspicious. Security cameras picked her up after No. 696 came to Ward 20. But she hasn't appeared for a month since No. 696 was exterminated. She bought the small dress. Last sighting? Shirakami Park entrance. The day after Asaki Fueguchi died. It's midnight, so it's murky. Midnight? Enlarge this. Clearer. Amon, do you see it too? I do. Wait a minute. Please explain. Ghouls have learned our movements in the last month. This raises two possibilities. They'll come to kill us, or leave this ward. If they come to kill us, luck's on our side. We won't be so lucky if they try to leave. I need an explanation. What are those fatherless ghouls thinking, and what will they do if they leave? Before they leave this ward, they'll mourn the father again. Hinami? Hesse? You read difficult books. I read that a long time ago. I couldn't understand a lot. My mom's really tired. If you want, I could help you with it. "The bird fights its way out of the egg. "The egg is the world. Who would be born must first destroy a world." What does it mean? Wait a second. Think of frying an egg. If you want to fry it and eat it, you have to... ...break the shell, right? If you want something, I guess you have to move forward without fear of getting hurt. I'd have to eat an egg to understand. Oh yeah. Sorry. Okay. It's late, so let's pick this up tomorrow. Goodnight. Kaneki... I need to ask another favor. What is it? I'll help if I can. Take me to my dad's grave. I can't. The doves... It's not like a human's. After all, when ghouls die, the CCG takes them all away somewhere. But... What if they... Kaneki, please. Before we leave this ward, at least let me give my father this. My dad loved the coffee at this cafe. Alright. How about I place these on your dad's grave for you? The doves don't know my face. Okay? Amon? Kusaba here. An eyepatch? He wore it over his left eye. What's buried here? You want to dig it up?! Get your hands dirty! Or go back to HQ and shuffle papers. Morality can't destroy evil. "In this world, we are justice. We are morality." I'll help you. Now we know. How do you read this? Well, this is... Hey. Oh, this is "shuu." "Shuu"? It means "sudden rain." Yeah, it does. You couldn't read it either. Quit laughing! I'm truly grateful for all you've done. When you're settled, come back for coffee. I will. Definitely. Hinami? See you again. Alright, we'll be going. Please thank everyone else for me. Mr. Yoshimura, what kind of place is Ward 24? The last resort for ghouls with nowhere else to go. Kaneki. Take these to them. Oh dear! Hey. Are you alright? It's "shuu." "Shuu"? Sudden rain. Kaneki taught me. He knows a lot. I hope we can see everyone again sometime. Me too. We will. Do you have a minute? It's true that my husband and I took many lives to survive. But this child has only eaten what we've given her. Please, don't punish her! What a talkative rat. Hinami, run. But... I'll be fine. Hinami? Mom's in danger! Mom! Hinami! A moving display of motherly love. How revolting. Kaneki, help her! Don't... Please. Anything but that! Any last words? Hinami... Li... Mommy! I'm sorry. It's my fault this happened. We'll take care of Hinami here for now. There were only two. If they're killed in Ward 20, they'll send in more doves. To kill Hinami. I'll protect her. And who'll protect you? I'm starving. Amon. If only the girl's left, leave the rest to us. You two can return to HQ. She's young, but still dangerous. Plus, there's the eyepatch wearer. Another ghoul? Only you've seen him, Kusaba. From tomorrow, you come with us. With you, huh? Actually, when you and Mado were first sent here from HQ, I considered asking for a transfer. Desk work's safer. But I changed my mind after watching you. Because of the way you risk your lives to pursue justice. Man, I'm stuffed. Maybe I ate too much. Their shrimp tempura is the best! It's fried to order. You prefer noodles? It's the quickest option. Oh, of course. Better to take time investigating than eating. I'll try it next time. Shrimp tempura. Amon! Kusaba! Amon... Watch and learn. When faced with an enemy, even if you're mutilated, fight! That's what a pro does, Amon. Touka? Touka! Huh?! Don't tell me you... - Butt out. - No! You need treatment! If you won't... ...go and kill them. Can you? You can't. A murderer like me deserves to die. But... Ghouls like Ryoko and Hinami being slaughtered... ...is wrong. I... I don't want you... ...to die. A hunger for vengeance becomes all-consuming. Let it go. But... Attacking a dove... meant she was ready to accept all consequences. That's a fact. When Touka heals, she'll do it again. You said Anteiku helps other ghouls. So, you want to go up against hundreds of agents with the few ghouls we have here at Anteiku? I'm sure everything you've told me is the truth, Mr. Yoshimura. I'm sure you've seen many things that I never have. Even so... I don't know about attacking agents, or the rules of the ghoul world. So, I want to see with my own eyes, and make up my own mind. Mr. Yoshimura told me, that you'd be here. Touka. Teach me how to fight. I hate being... no use to anyone. Touka... Hey! Wait a minute! Sure, I'll teach you. Touka... Touka... But I only know one way. We ghouls heal quickly from fractures. So don't fear them. Sorry Touka! Are you okay? This world is wrong. We have to make it right. Your kagune. Not bad. I gave it an eyepatch to suit you. It's... on the wrong side. I wanted to see the eye you're hiding. I'm ready. They have a sharp sense of smell. If we set bait, they'll come. And if we're lucky, that rabbit will too. You'll really go alone? I want you to patrol the area. A third or fourth ghoul might appear. Got it. Now then... It's time to take center stage, Amon. Hinami? That scent... Hinami. Mom?! Mom... You're slow! I'll go ahead! Amon, I've snagged a baby rat. I'm on my way. You'll make a splendid addition. I can't let you leave. No! It's about time you let her know. Well? Look familiar? Say hi to Mommy. Why kill Kusaba? This world is wrong. You're the ones deforming it. What Rabbit did... ...was wrong, I know. Then again... I can't believe... ...that you're right. More people... should know... about us... Pathetic. Why does your kind want to live a life built on sin? What's wrong with wanting to live? We are what we are, but we were born. We were raised. Humans are our only food! How are we supposed to live right in bodies like these? Monsters like your kind... ...are sinners for wanting to live! Any last words? Hinami... Don't treat us this way! Magnificent! It's simply magnificent! Hinami! End this! I'll make a quinque out of you! My very own quinque... Families should... ...be together, shouldn't they? He's the man... who killed your parents! Killing him... ...won't bring them back! No... Don't... Don't make me into a killer! If this world... ...is what people like you... ...believe in... ...then this world... ...is wrong! Hey, do I... Do I deserve to live? I... hurt someone. Hinami. I think your mom was trying to tell you to... "Live." I'm sure of that. Let's go home. Local residents have been warned. A dismembered body found recently is now believed to be that of a ghoul investigator. As there were no bite marks, the motive appears to have been revenge. Read for me again? Don't cry, dumbass.
