He had wanted to photograph me in places we saw come to life. I need to find myself again. I need solitude. We don't know - Jean-Luc and I - if we should see each other again. These events that drew us together, also drew us apart. Those who make revolution halfway only dig their own graves. I listen to music almost all the time. Monteverdi, Vivaldi, Couperin, Handel, Bach... Spanish composers from the 16th and 17th century. The other night, I even organized a kind of candlelight ritual - open parenthesis - I also lit a fire - close parenthesis. I put on a fantasia - open quote - for guitar imitating the harp in the style of Ludovico - close quote - by Alonso Mudarra. The magnificat. Friends of my parents offered me their house. They wont come this year, to Normandy. The house is called Le Broy. It is isolated in a hamlet. It's big, It's almost cold. "Luther frowned. "The bold position which this strange man took against the state offended him "and thinking over the decree the squire had sent from Kohlhaasenbruck..." "... from Kohlhaasenbruck" "to the baron "he asked what he wanted from the Dresden court. "'I demand that the baron be punished according to law,' replied Kohlhaas. "'I also demand my horses be returned "'in the state they were found at the castle. "'And I demand compensation "'for the injury suffered both by me "'and the loss of my groom Herse who fell "'at Muhlberg, through the violence inflicted upon us."' - My dear Marianne, - My dear Marianne, - Please don't be angry that I haven't written in so long. - ...haven't written in so long. You know, of course, all that has happened in France. I've just discovered Bach's cantata... - "Ich habe genung" You probably know it. - "Ich habe genung" You probably know it. Write me sooner than I've written. - I'm at the house of some friends, 150 kilometers from Paris. They are not here. - They are not here. The house is called Le Broy. Why did he look at me so sternly afterwards, before we separated? I run in the countryside. I read. I picked ears of wheat and I made a flower bouquet with them. Some of the wheat has already been reaped. I pick apples. I climb trees like when I was six years old... I used to climb the tall mimosa tree in grandmother's garden. In that house near the sea, on the outskirts of Cannes. I went to mother Martin's old mill. She's beginning to get to know me. The apples I pick in the countryside are more acrid than at Le Broy but I think they're better. In the attic at Broy, there is a pile of stones. The house will be renovated soon... and overtaken by painters and workers. So then I'll have to leave. I picked up a stone and made a throwing motion. Then I put it down. The Sainte-Scolasse festival, the village 3 kilometers away, ends tomorrow night. I heard it on my way back from the mill where I bought for some reason a sonata by Liszt. It's romantic, decadent and old fashioned and a little too sad. I was wrong to bring 3 pairs of shoes here. The ones I use to walk in the countryside have worn heels. But I brought more outfits than I need. An old bourgeois habit. So I change more than I need to. I also have the big hat Babette lent me. The sunlight is very harsh. I'm reading Michael Kohlhaas. - I wish I could read it in your language. - I wish I could read it in your language. - I'm reading Michael Kohlhaas. - For a long time I've wanted to learn German. On a wall I've hung up a series of photos Jean-Luc tookof me. Jean-Luc has also gone away. I don't know if we'll see each other again. I shouldn't see him again. "My eyes suddenly horribly See no further than myself "I make gestures in the void "I am like the blind-born "Witness to his sole night "Life suddenly horribly No longer measures up to time "My desert contradicts space "Rotten desert livid desert "Of my dead one I desire "I have in my body the ruins of love "My dead one in her dress the collar stained with blood." "My eyes suddenly horribly "See no further than myself "I make gestures in the void "I am like the blind-born "Witness to his sole night "Life suddenly horribly No longer measures up to time "My desert contradicts space "Rotten desert livid desert "Of my dead one I desire "I have in my body the ruins of love "My dead one in her dress the collar stained with blood." Jean-Luc read me this Eluard poem to me before we split up.

Heinrich von Kleist - The truth is that on this earth... - "The truth is that... "On this Earth... "no one could really help me." Heinrich von Kleist "Everything earthly is contained in this formula: "kill yourself, "persist, "surpass yourself." Hegel - "The existing city, subjected to an incoherent development, "is transformed into a dense agglomeration "a land full of obstacles where one tries moving from one point to another. "The city becomes a necessary economic evil "and it flees at the first opportunity. "Its higher function of exchange and meeting is lost in constraint. "Our constant biological rhythm "conflicts with the increasing speed "of technical means that we have at our disposal "in existing, unadapted structures." - I just read an article by Alica and Hieronim Listowski, two young Polish architects based in France. Gra-zie-lla - Miss Marianne Weber Kirsenstrasse Munich Here are some quotes of inscriptions taken from walls in Paris and the university buildings. - Quotes from Spinoza, Saint-Just, Antonin Artaud, René Char, Robert Escarpit, a Chinese proverb and others. - But most of these inscriptions were spontaneous. - "The reflection of life is only the appearance of experience." - "Life is elsewhere."

"Watch out for your ears, they have walls." Marcuse, The One Dimensional Man, Negative Thinking Aristotle's Metaphysics states the connection between concept and control: the knowledge of"first causes" is "as knowledge of the universal" the most effective and certain knowledge, for disposing over the causes is disposing over their effects. By virtue of the universal concept, thought attains mastery over the particular cases. However, even in its most extreme forms logic still refers to the structure of the given world, the experienced world, as general as it is. The pure form is still that of the content which it formalizes. The idea of formal logic itself is a historical event in the development of the mental and physical instruments for universal control and calculability. In this undertaking man had to create theoretical harmony out of actual discord, to purge thought from contradictions, to bring out identifiable and interchangeable units in the complex process of society and nature. For formal logic, the idea of conflict between essence and appearance is outmoded and possibly meaningless. I have not dreamed for a long time. Jean-Luc made love to me last night. "'Now, Kohlhaas,' the Elector repeated, 'Now that justice has been accorded to you "'prepare to give satisfaction to His Imperial Majesty "'whose representative "'has come to accuse you for the breach of the public peace.' "'I'm ready,' Kohlhaas replied, "removing his hat and throwing it to the ground. "He took his children once more in his arms, "pressed them to his heart "and gave them to the bailiff of Kohlhaasenbrück. "While the latter "silently weeping, "led the children away from the place of punishment, "Kohlhaas turned to the scaffold. "He had already untied his handkerchief and was preparing to open his doublet "when he saw, "hidden behind two gentlemen "the well-known man with the blue and white feathers. "Freeing himself from the guards, he strode up to him, "took the locket from round his neck, "took out the mysterious message, "unsealed it and read it. "Fixing his gaze steadily on the man with the feathers "who began to entertain hopes, "he put it into his mouth and swallowed it. "At this sight, the man with the plumage fell down in convulsions. "While the man's attendants stooped to lift him, "Kohlhaas climbed the scaffolding "and soon his head fell under the executioner's ax. "Thus ends the history of Michael Kohlhaas." Michael Kohlhaas, the rebel of Saxony, was a bourgeois who respected power, trusted the law and was what some would call a "good subject." It's the story of a man, facing society alone. Near the radio building, young people gathered, some attacked, three tanks were set on fire. The soldiers shot. It was a serious, dramatic incident but it seems limited and isolated. To our knowledge, it is the only case of a bloody clash in Czechoslovakia, invaded last night by Russian troops and their allies. Because, in fact, in a few hours, last night and this morning, Soviet troops, helped by their allies in the Warsaw Pact, except the Romanians, that is, helped by the East Germans, the Polish, the Bulgarians and Hungarians, in a few hours last night and this morning troops of the Warsaw Pact occupied Prague and all of Czechoslovakia. A telegram sent by Yevgeny Yevtushenko to Mr. Brezhnev and Mr. Kosygin. I cannot sleep. I don't know how to continue living. All I know is that I have a moral duty to express to you the feelings that overpower me. I am deeply convinced that our action in Czechoslovakia is a tragic mistake and a blow to Soviet-Czechoslovak friendship and the Communist movement. It lowers our prestige in the world and in our own eyes. It is a set back for all progressive forces, for peace in the world and for humanity's dreams of future brotherhood. It is a personal tragedy for me because I have many friends in Czechoslovakia and I don't know how I would seem if I were to meet them again. I love my country and my people. I'm a modest inheritor of the traditions of Russian literature of such writers as Pushkin,Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky and Solzhenitsyn. These traditions have taught me that silence is sometimes a disgrace. - "Lucidity is the wound closest to the sun." Mom! Mother! Only one exists. Balthazar has vanished. Good morning Ma Martin! Good morning Graziella! Little rabbit, little rabbit! I'm gonna look for the hunter. You see? I don't go hunting anymore. I go fishing instead. Do the fish bite? It's like I had a gun or if I went hunting with a fishing rod. In any case hunting is too exhausting and my gun is broken. The fish are too green! There may not be any fish but there are fleas, little stones... I'm flying, I flew. Can I help you? Who is it? Can I help you? What's that over there? What's that over there? Over there, what's that? Hi! Hello? Hello Graziella! Hello cat. Are you ignoring me? Are you sulking? Hello dog. I'm not a dog. I'm a cat. I thought you were a dog. So over there is a cat? Kitty, kitty! Then the cat goes: "Grrr!" If she continues, I'm gonna scratch her. Catch! The cat's in the dog kennel and he doesn't want to come out. I don't want to come out. The cat's no longer in the kennel. I don't want to bite him. I don't want to bite him. I don't want to bite him. It's my right! It's not a cat, it's a tiger. My god, he's rabid! I'm rabid! I am rabid! It's a beautiful striped tiger. I'll put you in my motor and I'll zigzag down the road. I run through the countryside. I read. I picked ears of wheat and I made a flower bouquet. Some of the wheat has already been reaped. I went to mother Martin's old mill. She's starting to get to know me. Here, at Le Broy, I climb up trees like when I was six years old. The apples in the countryside are more acrid than at Le Broy. But I think they're better. In the attic, there is a pile of stones. So I will have to go. It rained. I thought of hitchhiking to Moulin. I didn't go. People threw water on us from the window to reduce the effects of tear gas. We were almost caught on the corner of Rue Mouffetard and Rue de l'Arbalète. Jean-Luc was running behind me to protect me. He also did a series of portraits of me. [Jean-Luc's room] "I'm the last one on your road "The last spring the last snow fall "The last fight to not die "I'm the last one on your road "The last spring the last snow fall "The last fight to not die "And here we are lower and higher than ever. "Our bonfire has some of everything Pinecones tendrils "But also flowers stronger than water Sludge and dew, "The flame is below our feet the flame crowns us "At our feet insects birds men Will fly away. "The sky is light, the earth is dark, But the smoke leaves for the sky "The sky has lost all its fires. "The flame remains on earth. "The flame is the heart's swarm And all the blood's branches "It sings our tune "It clears our winter fog. "Nocturnal and in horror grieving up in flames "The ashes blossomed in joy and beauty "We turn our backs to the setting sun Everything has the color of dawn." Why did he look at me so sternly afterwards, before we split up? Why does he always have such a stern look? No, I don't want to die. I have to go to the Ste-Scolasse festival. It's supposed to end tomorrow night. I left this address with Jean-Luc so he's at least able to write me. He hasn't done so. I don't think he will. In the old trunk in the attic I found, it's strange, a fake gun and a cross together. In the countryside, I often pass a strange, unhinged character, bare chested, looking crazy and who never turns around to look at me. Why did I imagine Jean-Luc coming to get me, when it's all over? I came to find you. Summer's going to end. This film was shot in 7 days from August 19 to 25, 1968. It was edited by Marcel Hanoun assisted by Annick Surinack.
