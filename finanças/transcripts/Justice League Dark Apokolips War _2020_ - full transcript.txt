Rebmemer... Remember, John. Remember. Remember what? That I love you. Didn't think that was in doubt, Zee. I just wanted to say it, - before... - Before nothing. The League will sort this out and we'll be havin' pints by sundown. Or whatever that is 'round here. I'm glad you joined the League. I'm here for you, luv. Just don't ask me to wear a cape. All Justice League members, report to the hangar, now. Way to cock-block, Batsy. Well... time to go. Thank you for responding so quickly. Some of you already know what this is about, but I wanted to get the new members up to speed. This is Apokolips, home world of Darkseid, a power-mad despot who has orchestrated two attempted invasions of Earth, the first of which resulted in the formation of the Justice League. The second one, an attack from within our ranks by Cyborg Superman and his cyber force. Raven, what's wrong? It's nothing. This image was taken by surveillance ten hours ago on the edge of the solar system. Apokolips phased into our dimension and released stealth drones, then phased out again. This can only be looked at as a prelude to war. Darkseid aims to conquer the Earth and crush it under his heel. Regular Churchill, he is. Look, I know the guy's a genocidal maniac, but are we sure those are his immediate plans? Or something he'll try in like a thousand years? These are images from worlds that Darkseid has conquered. Our intel shows that he's now sent his elite guard and the Furies to act as an occupying force to thwart any resistance. I want to make this perfectly clear. We are facing an existential threat to the planet. We can't wait for Darkseid to make the first move. That could mean the end of us. We have to attack. It's a tough job. Aside from the big bad, this place is jam-packed with those Parademons. The League's faced them before. We know these are their weak spots. With our combined force, we can cut through them. Then, I'll do what needs to be done. This is madness. There's always a deal to be made. Let's at least send an envoy to Apokolips. No! Darkseid created a monster that nearly killed me. What chance would humanity have? Our only option is to destroy him. That means Earth could be ground zero in a world war. Look, I know some of you don't believe the visions I had about the Flashpoint, but... a truly global war means death and destruction on a scale you cannot imagine. Everyone on the planet is at risk, everyone we care about. - Flash is right. - John. Sure, this guy deserves killing, but you can't kick this hornet's nest like everyone on Earth is bulletproof. Look, I won't ask you to give anything more than I do. But this isn't up for discussion. We're going to stop Darkseid once and for all. Here's how we do it. The main team will attack through this entryway on Apokolips. Members of the Titans shall remain on Earth as a home guard. With the Furies and his elite guard off-world, and only Parademons to guard him, Darkseid will be vulnerable to attack. Honey, please get somewhere safe. Clark, I have a job, just like you. I may not be able to fight this war, but I can report the story. Stop worrying. Just promise to be as careful as you can. I will. Now go save the world. I love you. I know. Nervous? Nah. Could use a ciggie, though. Preparing Javelin for inter-dimensional portal. I got this, Bats. Sit back and relax. Booyah. Lovely. Picking up lifeform readings coming at us. But they're too big to be Parademons. Then what the hell are those things? Bollocks. Bollocks. And that's the last of the Glen Luffa. The Glens are full of whiskey, I mean, lots of whiskey. Ooh. Ah. The "H"s are gonna be a breeze after the "G"s. Too many bloody "Glens." You hear that? Still cryin' in your beer, eh? Eat yer heart out! Hello, my old friend, Glen Magoogan. We need him. We're doomed. John Constantine. I'm glad we found you. Find yer own pub. We're drinking our way through this one. In fact, the whole street's ours, pub-wise, so sod off. John, it's me. Clark Kent. You knew me as Superman. Oh, it is you. I thought you'd snuffed it. Oh, bloody hell! Now you've done it. John, wait. We're not here to fight. You come to the wrong place, then. Azarath Metrion... Stop! Stop it! Quit playin' around, boy scout! Smash 'em! I can't! Bloody useless, both of you. A little help would be nice. Ugh! Bloody nuisance. Last call, asshole. And I'm sober again. Magic can be such a bitch. Gift from Darkseid? Liquid Kryptonite... to keep me from ever being a threat. So he let you live to wander about demoralizing everyone. Impressive. Stop it, please. She gets like this, sometimes. I will exact vengeance on you, daughter! Release me, ungrateful spawn of mine! That's what she hears all the time. No wonder she's always in pain, and her healing powers don't work. John, where are you going? We have... A plan to save the world, right? And this time it will definitely work. Bugger off, Clarkie. I told you he was a waste of time. All cowards are. I didn't lead us all into a massacre! You did! Zatanna was a hero who fought bravely. But where were you when she needed you most? Ah, piss off, both of you. Zatanna would want you to hear us out. Below the belt, boy scout. More Parademons will be by. Come with if you want. Or not. What about you, Etrigan? Ugh! Whatever. Love what you've done with the place. What better metaphor for merry old England today? Drink? You can use the good glasses. Been all mopey ever since a friend of his died. Doesn't even rhyme anymore. What's the point? Look, are you going to help us or not? Saving your asses in the bar didn't count, eh? Offering whiskey in an unbroken glass? Bloody ingrates, you are. So, it was crap from the start, but what went wrong, eh? Tell me what happened. Darkseid knew every part of our plan. Those things that attacked us were half Parademon, half Doomsday. Barry and Hal fought hard, but were taken down. The rest of us didn't last much longer. Shazam was wounded, but Cyborg helped him escape. No! Darkseid didn't kill everyone. Some, he had plans for. A few days later, Darkseid sent those... "Paradooms" to Earth. We didn't have a chance. Does it hurt? Good. Even without powers, Clark is still fighting. You couldn't be bothered to do it once. John! Don't know why I ran. Been up against all sorts of bastards and I always stood tall. But this time I just ran. Why did I do that? Why? What do you need me for anyway? The magic you have left works just as good as mine. We just need a locator spell. A locator spell? And then you'll toddle off, will ya? Fine. I need some gear, so sit tight. Etrigan, continue loafing. Done. The third planet reaper is on the Earth's surface. Boring to the magma core has begun. With that ordnance, the guardians of Oa will be forced to bow before me, and the entire space sector will be mine. Why was this not completed earlier? The damage done to the Apokolips reactor - during the attack two years ago... - Your attack. My solution is working, but the power generated is less than your previous reactor. Perhaps my mind-molding didn't fully transform you into a capable servant. Perhaps you'd serve me better as a mindless drone. I am still your most competent acolyte, Lord Darkseid. Your former teammate, Luthor, believes otherwise. Not surprising. Luthor's only interest is saving his own skin. I only perform my duties at your pleasure, my liege. I won't stand for further delays. After all, a conqueror must conquer. Hmm. I thought there'd be fire. Only when I fart. We need to reassess the situation. Gather our forces to a new location. Another one just landed in China. Any idea what they're for? No. But whatever it is can't be good. We need to come up with a new strat... Oh, no, come on. Let's get you on your way, then. Who am I finding? Damian Wayne. Are you bloody daft, mate? And how exactly does the baby bat help? What do you care? Cheers, then. Okay, since I don't have a stocked magical pantry anymore, I have to conjure a portal from scratch big enough for all of us. Hmm, ten hours, give or take. Oh, and everyone has to stay still while I do it. Oh, for fuck's sake. - Azarath Metrion Zinthos! - Raven, no, you're too weak... I... I didn't mean to imply anything of the sort. When Lord Darkseid asked if I could do your job, I answered, "Maybe one day" but... Luthor, stop sniveling. Continue your report. Yes, Batman. The last of Earth's resources are being transferred to Apokolips. Everything will go according to Darkseid's schedule. Um, do you know if I'm included in His Lordship's plans? In a future where I'm alive to serve you both? My business is ensuring that Darkseid's vision is executed so his reign spreads to every corner of the galaxy. Don't worry about your place in those plans. Worry about doing what I tell you. Of course, Batman. Mmm. The infidels have breached our sanctuary! Slay them! Are you happy now? Assassins! Some challenge. Yawn. Ow! Etrigan the Slayer is here. Woe to you. And you. You also. Die, demon! Whatever. Enough! Hi. You. Damian, please listen to him. What's wrong with her? How long have you got, mate? I know you hate me, but I wouldn't be here if it wasn't necessary. I'll let you live. For now. I like him. Come on. Ungrateful witch! - I will exact vengeance on you, daughter! - No. - I won't let you. - Release me! Never. It's only a matter of time now, little bird. Only a matter of time. You're not getting out, Father. I have the will to do what must be done. Impudent daughter! If you die, I am trapped in this hell. Free me! Remember what I told you. Release me or I will kill the boy. Is there a way to cure her? You get Trigon out, and yeah, she'd recover - but... - But he destroys the world. Did you get any rest? Enough. Then come with me. You too, Kent. I want you to see what this war has cost my family. Steal anything and I'll cut your hands off. Oh, I really like him. I feared your plan would fail from the beginning. An army without killers is no army at all. But Batman believed in you. You cost me my father. And my teammates. I won't forgive that. Nightwing convinced me not to voice my many objections. "There are always risks in war," he said. He's not saying that anymore. You used the Lazarus Pit. You said you wouldn't. You promised. He was my brother. I had to take a chance. It just didn't work. We can't let what happened to Dick and everyone else be in vain. Help us fix things. How? You're powerless now. We need you to get through to Batman. You can break Darkseid's programming. You grossly overestimate the influence I have on my father. Batman cares about you. Even awful parents care about their kids. I should know. I was there when Bruce learned about Dick's death. It affected him. It almost got through. He overcame my mother's brainwashing once. If anyone could survive Darkseid's programming, it'd be father. So you'll try? It's my responsibility to save him, or barring that, kill him if he can't be saved. He would want that. But the only way to Apokolips is to use the boom tube in LexCorp Tower. How do you expect to do that? You're getting worse. Ugh. Great pep talk. Here, let me help. Lois said she was negotiating with their leader. She's a people person, so I'm sure the situation's well in... ...hand. Nice hook. Where'd you pick that up? I'm an army brat. Well, no one out-brats me. Yeah. Ha-ha. Lois? - Lois! - She looks like she can handle herself. Come on, Harley, have at her! Nothing like having a cold one while a couple of fine sheilas beat each other bloody, eh, mate? Beer? Break her face... Clark's wife! Ugh. Brits. Aussies. - Poms. - Convicts. - Wankers. - Wankers. Do your best, honey! Ha-ha! You've got to be kidding. Always! Harley, come on! I tawt I taw a puddy tat. Ooh! Way to go, ya beauty! And the winner and new champion, luscious Lois Lane! Captain Boomerang at your service. Have I mentioned that I'm, uh, quite experienced "down under," if ya know what I mean? No means no, Boomerang! All right, lady. Looks like we've got a deal. Listen up, everybody! Now we ride for Lex Luthor in his fortress of bald-itude. So drink up, esteemed ladies and gents of the Suicide Squad, because tomorrow we take back this planet! Why do you always lead with your chin? I learned from the best. Ow! Oh, bollocks, it's my ex. You and Harley? Gross. Do I look mad? How did Amanda Waller let a lunatic like you become leader of the Squad? Easy. She died. Cancer! Sorry. It's a defense mechanism. King Shark is a shark. A week after that, my puddin' died. Thanks to new Batman, who is no fun, by the way. So, me and my merry band of suicidals decided to go freelance. We've been taking our cut from Luthor's supply trains since this shitshow started. We're real Robin Hood-types. Rob from the rich and sell to the poor. "Give to the poor." Huh? That can't be right. Do you have somewhere private? You need to see this. My office. We'll discuss everything over my top-notch bottle of hooch. Now we're talking. No! I won't let you! Never! I think I need a minute. Is there a place we could rest? Oh, is that what you kids are callin' it these days? Cheetah'll show you the way. I don't like kids. Sticky hands. Shut up. Sorry. Sometimes he gets so loud I have to answer. You probably think I'm weak. Raven, you're one of the strongest people I know. So, how'd you end up with Kent? You left and I was alone. I just wanted to end the pain. I'm sorry for not coming with you. When I asked you to join me in leading the League of Assassins, I wasn't doing it because you're a good fighter, I... I had feelings for you. If you didn't, you made the right decision. It wasn't that at all. I left because my father wants to kill you. After everything, I couldn't risk that. Darkseid's machines have gone online in the Congo, China, and off the coast of England. What the heck are they? They phase the Earth's magma into Darkseid's base. So these things must be destroyed. That's a temporary solution. We need to blow up Apokolips. Oh, is that all? Piece of cake. We can't brute-force this. On Apokolips, Darkseid has Paradooms. Parademons upgraded with Superman's DNA, like Doomsday was. Don't rub it in, honey. We have to get them off of Apokolips to have any chance. To do that, we plan on mounting simultaneous attacks on two of the machines. That should cause the Paradooms to be sent to Earth as reinforcements. Why not attack all three? We don't have enough people. If the two teams do enough damage, we'll be fine. The boom tube gate is located in LexCorp Tower. That's where we come in. We take the tower. Our strike team transports to Apokolips, sets its power generator to go critical, reverses the boom tubes, bringing all the Paradooms back to Apokolips, then we get out before it blows up. Easy peasy, rich n' cheesy. Ha-ha! King Shark is a shark. Aren't you forgetting one small detail, name of Darkseid? "Warm beer, soggy chips" here is right. We can't take him. No one can. Darkseid is going to Oa. We only begin after he's gone. Once we're there, we shut down the portal so he can't come back. Without Apokolips, he can't destroy Earth. How do you know he'll be gone? Did you steal his diary? I have a source in Darkseid's camp called "Sleeper." He or she has been slipping me information for months. No wonder you and Kent are together. You're both gullible fools. Darkseid is playing you. Or Batman is. The information from Lois' source has led to every victory we've had since the conquest. You have a strange concept of "victory," mate. The planet's molten core will be gone in a week. Then it's game over. I know this plan has astronomical risks and impossible odds, but we're out of time. Blah, blah, blah. Let's do this thing! Hi, we need your van. Ah, crikey. That's not right. Yeah, g'day. My friend here was attacked by thugs. We killed 'em right back. Yup. Yes, siree Bob. You betcha. Gotta get my friend to a doc. How are you? Can we go? Lord Darkseid, reports indicate that the lanterns have mostly fallen. Good. I go to claim Oa for my empire. Any remaining resistance shall not be a problem. Do not interrupt me. Yes, master. It's Sleeper. Darkseid's gone. I'm sending the signal to attack the machines. China team has engaged. North Sea team engaged. Orchid's with them, John. Wonder where she went after she kicked me out of the house. Why have the rebels been able to stage these attacks on our reapers? How the hell should I know? I don't do security for the entire Earth. Isn't that your job? Hmm. I say that with all due respect. Stand ready to transport the Paradooms. On your mark. What's wrong? I'm not getting a signal that any of the Paradooms have left Apokolips. - Another debacle. - Damian. We should have waited, we should have gathered a third force. This is my fault. I'll sort this. You here? I thought I'd pop by to discuss fertilizer and the such. There you are, Swampy. You are wiser than I give you credit for. Well, not a high bar, I gather. One day, Constantine. One day. You're leaving already? But just know that this thing here will be the death of your precious green. It... steals the heart of the planet? And you, you walking salad, you didn't notice, did you? Just happy that half the people on the planet are dead, eh? The humans earned their fate. By that logic the green has it coming, too. Like humanity, it was minding its own business and, oh, too bad, death sentence. The green will not die! Swampy's pretty pissed. That should bring down the flyin' uglies. It worked. Harley, you're up. Yahtzee! And out. No more planning, just doing. Is there no end to these minions? ♪ If you're happy And you know it Smash a head ♪ ♪ If you're happy And you know it Smash a head ♪ ♪ If you're happy And you know it ♪ ♪ Then your face Will surely show it ♪ ♪ If you're happy And you know it Smash a head ♪ ♪ If you're happy And you know it ♪ ♪ And you really Wanna show it ♪ ♪ If you're happy And you know it Splat the brains! ♪ Best boss ever. King Shark is a shark. I need a cigarette. Azarath Metrion Zinthos! Rest well, Shiva. We sent the Paradooms to help you! But sir, they're eating everyone! HR is going to be furious. Ah, we're sitting ducks here. I love duckies. Worst team ever. The boom tube gate is there. One floor up. No stairs. This way. Keep it moving, gang. You said this would be hard. It's not hard. I'm afraid you don't have the proper clearance. Ah, bollocks. Damian! No one will mourn you! Raven, no! Stay in control. Can everyone stop trying to kill Luthor? We need him. He's a stinking collaborator. Too right, he is. Let me take a little off the top. Please, I was surrounded and the battle was over. I had to make a choice. I've been helping Lois ever since. You're Sleeper? He's a traitor who changed sides when it suited him. What makes you think he won't do it again? Because you need me and you don't have a lot of time. Batman won't allow it. Abomination! You will stand no more! The Congo reaper is a loss. Concentrate the forces on the North Sea and Great Wall reapers. Shazam! You'll take care of it, won't you? If my father gets control. You want me to add your soul to my ledger? The spell has to be... ugly. My body has to be more than dead. The last accursed Dagger of Ostova. Good. That'll work. Keep Daddy in his pen and we won't have to go down that road. I'm strong. I can do it. This thing's kind of stuffy. Hon, you wear two layers in the summer. You'll live. My finest work. Fires kryptonite-infused missiles and high-explosive rounds. Perfect for Paradooms. But you made it to kill my husband. What can I say, I had issues. That's a whole lot of kryptonite. We'll hold this end. Lois, you... Someone has to make sure the portal stays closed. - But you need to... - Hey... we're in this together. I love you, Lois Lane. I know. Now, go save the world. Touching. Now, can we leave before I come to my bloody senses? Why are you still here, John? Don't exactly know, Clarkie. Guess I just want to see how it all turns out. Come back to me, Smallville. That should help us blend in, but I suggest we keep moving. Luthor, there's been unauthorized use of the portal from LexCorp. I want an explanation. Just a power surge, Batman. It's nothing, already handled. All hail Darkseid. So, you've finally decided to reveal your traitorous nature. Lord Darkseid will kill you slowly. Well, I guess I'm completely on your side now. Yay, team. Lord Darkseid, apologies for the intrusion. I trust this is important, Batman. We had an unauthorized boom tube from LexCorp. In brightest day, in blackest night... So, Luthor validated your concerns. No evil shall escape my sight. Send the Furies to capture the invaders. I will deal with them myself. Let those who worship evil's might... And also, teleport a portion of Earth's magma here. I'd like to make a point. Beware my power... As you will it. Green Lantern's light! Diana. I'm so sorry this happened to you. To all of you. I have to say, I don't fancy the new look, luv. Makes you look a bit murdery. Kori, it's me! You're being controlled! Azarath Metrion Zinthos! Oh, shit. Easy, Princess. Finally, a challenge. Took you long enough. I like to make an entrance. And so it ends. My race is run. I regret nothing. It was fun. None of you will last long. You have no true warriors. You're right, Princess. We could use one of those. Oh, the old magic, that's the stuff. Cuts both ways, though. Hear me, Wonder Woman of the Justice League. You are a paragon for warriors through the ages, not Darkseid's minion. Break free, now! I am... Diana of Themyscira. Daughter of Hippolyta. I follow the old gods and will never again bow to the new. Care to do the honors? There's a tunnel behind you leading to the power generator. Leave them to me. Do not hold what happens next against me, friends. Always keep the best one for yourself, Lexy. Lex... Well, that's a problem. For Clark and the team to have any chance, those monsters can't get back to Apokolips. We have to hold them off. Last call, then. King Shark is a shark. Buckle up, Suicide Squaddies. Today's the day we earn our name! Oh, shite and fried eggs. My God. Barry? Barry! Clark. We thought you were dead. It was phased when Omega Beam hit. Apokolips reactor damaged. Converted me to replacement. Make it stop. You gotta make me stop. Let me. Sleep, mate. He caused it, the Flashpoint. What are you talking about? If he doesn't go back to save his mum, Darkseid isn't here. But if Flash is the power generator... there's no generator to blow up. So we can't stop Darkseid from coming back. Well, come on, then. Too far in to turn around now. We go through. What are you planning, Constantine? It's magic. You wouldn't understand. I hate magic. King Shark... is a shark! Come on, you bunch of assholes. Hey, you want a boomerang? Here! Come one, come all! What about you? And you! And you have a boomie. You all have some fucking boomies. I've got you covered! Almost out of ammo. We can't let them through! Everybody, on the platform! Azarath Metrion Zinthos! Aah! Can't do this long. Raven... Let go. Trust me, daughter. Let go! Raven! I'll kill you, boy! So, that was my dad. None can resist Darkseid. Hail Darkseid. I am the source wall. Lord Darkseid has ordered you taken alive to personally see to your punishment. Please wait for Lord Darkseid's return. You shall be dealt with accordingly. Just stop saying "Darkseid." I must alert Lord Darkseid. - I am the source wall... - What are you doing, Constantine? Techno magic. Feels like taking a test you haven't studied for. Luckily, I cheat. Lord Darkseid. Lord Darkseid. What is happening? Debugging ya, mate. It's gonna hurt. You've all acquitted yourselves admirably. Excellent technique, Mera. Now, let's find our friends. What's... What's going on? No! Stop! I'm fully integrated, Clark. There's not enough left of me to ever leave this place. Now, listen, Batman stepped out to talk to the big... Batman's returned. And with his lord and master. You! I knew Clark would come one day. It was inevitable. But I never thought you'd be part of a lost cause, Constantine. I'm here to level the playing field. No running this time. Maybe Zatanna's loss finally broke you. Was drinking yourself to death not fast enough? You won't pick us apart so easily, Father. You dare call me that? Your mother drugged me to conceive you, goaded me into raising you, and broke me mentally. But once my eyes were opened by Lord Darkseid, I see you were never my son. Only a burden. Don't listen to him, Damian. That's Darkseid talking. Come, then. End your burden once and for all. Why is the whelp still alive? Correct this, Batman. Mobius Chair, attack protocol Alpha-Red. Shit! In the past, I let you win. This time... I won't hold back. Bruce! Don't! Finish him, Batman. Finish him and take your place as first among my servants. You heard me, slave. Finish him. Go to hell. You disappoint me. No! Damian! I am... free! John! He's coming! Do it now! Your bonds are loosened, but not yet broken... until your oath to me is spoken! I'm offering you a willing magical host. Let's kill the bastard. I have a better idea. Bollocks! What's this? What have you done, Kryptonian? Not the Kryptonian. Not anymore. No matter. So, you are one of the so-called new gods. I am unimpressed. Damian. Good to see you again, Father. Hold on. Dad, I know I wasn't the ideal son, but you took me in and welcomed me. You taught me a better way. And I thank you for that. Son. Remember, Father. Justice, not vengeance. Save them. Save her. Clark? Clark, are you there? Clark! Honey? Come in! Please! Clark! Lois. Bruce? Forty seconds to reach minimum safe distance. I need to speak with Clark. There's not a lot of time left. Vic, send the message to Clark's mech suit now, so he can see it. It's good to have you back, Bats. Clark, honey, I know we planned on always being together, but that's not going to happen now. Lois? What is this? King Shark is a shark! King Shark is a shark. King Shark is a shark! And Captain Boomerang is a boomerang, you fuck knuckle. It's been an honor to fight by your side. Are you shitting me? Top of the world, puddin'! Ten, nine, eight... seven, six... You'll have to be strong. - ...four, three... - I know you can do it. - ...two, one. - Lois? I love you, Clark. No! This cannot be! It is impossible! And now to deal with... You. You took everything from me. Now, I'm going to make you pay. You will do nothing but die. Unless I miss my guess, we'll need Constantine. Well, that's a problem. Hello, John. Hey. So, I finally bought the farm. Easy as crossing a street. But how in the hell did you get me into heaven? Pulled a few strings. I needed to apologize for making you run away when I died. Remember? Rebmemer. A compulsion spell. Batsy. He thought we should have a backup plan in case everything went wrong. Can you forgive me? 'Course I do! I get to spend eternity with you. First question, are there any pubs? If not, we build one. Next time. Today, our friends still need your help. Oh, come on, Zee. I did my bit. I'm dead. John Constantine, you of all people should know that means nothing when destiny's involved. Damian... I... I love you. Goodbye for now, John. Holy shit, he's alive. How are you alive? I can't even be a corpse in peace! Wanking destiny can go bugger itself. You brought me back. I had to take the chance. Release me! Bet you wish you had taken my offer now, eh, wanker? We're going to talk when this is done. Now, what's the bloody plan? Vic, do we have a way out? Working on it. Damian... those things I said... Don't make this overly emotional, Father, it wasn't your fault. I've relinked with the Mother Box. I can transport you off the station and bring back the Paradooms. Then I send Apokolips to no destination at all. Darkseid is trapped with his monsters forever. We're not leaving Clark behind. That won't work. Darkseid needs to be distracted for me to do my thing. Yeah, yeah, let me think. Still pissed at you. You can't be serious. Uh-huh. On second thought... that's perfect. All together now. Azarath Metrion Zinthos! You have spirit, Kryptonian. But the strength of a lost love is only... Go! Unless you would fight me for the right to destroy him. And now, new god, let's see who shall rule, and who shall serve! Okay, bus is leaving. There'll be no better time. Victor? Can't come. Download your consciousness into a mother cube, or whatnot. It doesn't work like that, genius. Now leave, before these assholes realize they're gonna be trapped here forever. Cheers. Go on, I'm right behind you. What a wonderful gift, daughter. Be well! Goodbye, Father. Looks like I get the last word. Suck it, bitches! No! You're mad! No! What news? Even though the planet reapers were stopped before they finished, the damage was done. How bad? We lost 31% of the Earth's molten core. The planet's rotation is compromised. The smallest change either way will mean freezing or burning. My best estimate is another billion deaths before we can get anything under control. Provided we can. Okay. I know everyone's been through hell, but we can't quit. The Justice League doesn't quit. If we work together, we can do this. We can save the planet. You know what you have to do, mate. Clear the board... start again. Another Flashpoint? I promised Iris before she... I can't. Yeah, figured you'd say that. Everything would change. Again. And some of those changes may be shite. And we may make the same mistakes again. It won't be perfect... but it'll be a long sight better than what we got now.
