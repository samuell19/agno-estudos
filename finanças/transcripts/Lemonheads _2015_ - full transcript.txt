And I brought a switchblade. A fucking switchblade. Stay relatively clam, sharp, witty. I talked him out of murder one right into grand larceny. They got me for everything, okay, they took my jacket, the bastards, and certainly, they stuck me for every last dollar. I mean, come on, Paul, I couldn't even fucking make this shit up if I tried to. I got nothing. Now let me ask you something, Paul. How long have I been coming here for? Coming here to pick up from you? Four months. Four times a week, four weeks in a month, that's 16 times a month, times four months. That's 64 days, which doesn't include today. Now, every time I get five bags and you charge $10 a bag. That's a little bit steep, that's all right, because I genuinely like you. $10 dollars a bag times five is 50. $50 times 64 days, Paul. The last four months, I've single handedly put $3,200 in your pocket. No hassles, no fuss, no questions asked. I mean, I'm like the client that's come down from heaven. You might as well call me Jesus, for Christ sake. I'm rotting away, Paul. I haven't eaten in three days. Lost 10 pounds in a week. See, I'm the kind of friend that believes in miracles. Would you be my friend, Paul? Can you give me my miracle? - Did you see their faces? - Why? They were all wearing hoods. - Jesus, that's just fucking terrible, Leo. I'll gladly do what I can. I mean. I got some cereal in the kitchen, a couple bananas, you hungry? Where you staying? - With a friend, of course. - They don't feed ya? What kind of hospitality is that? - I know. - Like I said, I'll gladly do what I can. I think I got some peanut butter puffs, maybe some corn flakes. - You know what I'm asking, Paul. Just give me one today, just fix me up. I don't need the five. Can't do it. Why not? - Because I played the credit game before. You start giving it out, sooner or later people think they're entitled to something. Privilege can fuck with a man's head, you know? I let bums take caps off me for nothing, I aint seen shit back. Everyone's got something to say, man. You aint the only one selling a sob. - Well, I understand. I'll be on my magical little way, then. In the meantime, if you could just fix me up with some of your old shit, just give me something that's gonna go bad anyway. - Leo-- - You're always fucking wrong. Okay, I'm not lying. - Goddamn it, that's enough. You know you fuckers are all the same. You're panhandling pricks who start buddying up just to get a fix on credit. You want my friendship? You want my compassion? How 'bout a bowl of fucking cereal? - You're literally letting me rot away. I'm fucking dying here, Paul. - Oh fuck you, I'm letting you die. I'm doing what I can. So don't tell me that. You want me to get my shit? You want your fix? Show me the goddamn money. We aint friends. You know what? Get the fuck out of my house. - I'm not leaving your petulant presence until I get a fucking fix. - I said get the fuck out of my house before I cut you up! Get off me, Leo. Leo! - Give me your fucking keys. Give me your fucking keys. Shit. Fuck. God fucking damn it! Where's the fucking dope? God fucking damn it. Where are the fucking drugs? Fuck! Fuck. - Did you get the stuff, Leo, did you get it? Did you get the stuff? - Louis, get your clothes on, we need to go right now. - What are you talking about? Where is it, Leo? You said you'd get it. Where is it, Leo? - He was dry, okay? - What does that mean? - It means he didn't fucking have anything. Jesus fucking Christ. - I thought you said this guy was your friend, Leo. You said he'd help us out, Leo. You said he would. - I apologize. Okay what I said if I waited a few days he might help us out. Fucking guy didn't have a goddamn thing. - What about the story, Leo? Did you try the story at least? - Yes, yes. I tried the story, okay? I begged him on my hands and knees and he didn't have anything, okay? I mean, what was I supposed to do? Give him a blowie? Oh, better yet, Louis, maybe I should of killed the guy. - Shit. - Louis, I never lied to you. I mean, ever since we were little fucking grunts, I have never lied to you, that's correct, right? - That's right. - Okay, then you should have the utmost understanding that I would never ask you to do anything unless we really fucking had to do something. We're sick, we're not getting any better lying around here on our asses like we've been doing, see? So we need to gather up all our fucking strength, all our fucking spoons and toys and shit, and get the fuck out there and be productive. Louis, will you just fucking look at me for once? For once in your fucking life, will you look at me? Louis. Louis, look at me? Good god, man, just fucking look at me. Come on, man. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, look, if you go out there with me, listen, if you go out there with me, I can make you better. Trust me. All right, you keep a lookout. I'm gonna shake down this junkie. - No, no, no. Are you, are you sure you want to do it? - You saying you want to do it? - Yeah, yeah. You think, you think he actually has anything? - Well, like I said, you never know. He might. - All right, tell me where I should check first. - I'd check his pockets, check his pants pockets and the jacket and you grab that bag behind him, too but Louis, listen to me, if he so much as fucking moves, you run like a bat out of hell, okay? - All right, all right. But you gotta, you gotta tell me, you gotta tell me when his eyes open, if his eyes open. - All right. I'll be right here, okay? You'll be all right. - All right. - Sorry, sorry. - Fucking rat. - Leo, no, stop. - Fucking rat. - Leo! - Give me your shit. Motherfucker. Don't you ever fucking touch him, you hear me? Fuck. Fuck you, you motherfucking piece of shit. Don't you ever fucking touch him. Fuck. Jesus fucking Christ. Come here, didn't have shit. No, no, no. Damn it, motherfucker. Louis. Goddamn it, man, you took a fucking wallop. Jesus, you fucking got hit. I'm sorry, goddamn it, that's my fault. Okay? - Am I gonna be okay? - Yeah, god damn it. Man, listen. Calm down, the pain right now is all in your mind, okay? Remove the residence of fear and it all goes away. Louis, I'm gonna have you sit tight, okay, I'm gonna be right back. You sit here. You're safe, you're fine, all right? Sit tight. - How much money we take? - 75 cents and a blue ink pen. Plenty of options. - Shit. Goddamn it. I feel like I'm gonna puke again, Leo. Every fucking second I feel like I could puke. Jesus Christ. Fucking shit myself two times yesterday, Leo. Two fucking times, I shit myself. - Damn it man, will you suck it up? Literally. Well. I'm gonna gather my little brain cells and I'm gonna strategize a plan for us, all right? Before long I'll take... Louis? Lou, have we lost you today? Could you be a doll and go into my backpack there? You'll find yourself a little black book. - What's this? - It's an address book. It has names, numbers, guys I used to know. Just read me off a few, will ya? - How 'bout Marcello Scott? - He's dead. - OD? - I don't know, he was a fat bastard. Probably food poisoning. - KKK Kyle? - Oh fuck no. In fact, scratch his name off entirely. - Phil? - Paperboy? - Give me all the fucking money! - Get the fuck out of here. Get the fuck. Go, go, go, go. Oh shit. Paperboy, we gotta fucking go. Oh shit. - Let's go, motherfucker. Let's go, motherfucker. - We gotta fucking go. Oh shit. My foot, my foot. Fuck. - You know I stopped that shit last year, Leo, you remember when we talked about this? - Why I was under the impression you were joking. - Why would I be joking? - It had to be a joke. You used to take hits from cotton balls out of dumpsters under the bridge. We used to prowl the beach every night looking for suckers. I mean, you were the fucking paper boy. - No, no, no don't bring that shit up. - You were the fucking paper boy, that's who you were. You were a fucking out of work fucking addict just like the rest of us and by god you were the craziest fucking lunatic-- - I will slap your fucking face so hard. I said don't bring that fucking shit up in my house again, you hear me? - Yes, yes. Phil, fuck, I'm sorry. God, Christ I beg your pardon. Okay, no I was out of line. - No, no. - Fuck. Fuck. - No, no, no. I'm sorry, all right? And what you say your name was, kid? - Oh this. - Louis. - What the fuck happened to your eye, man? Stairs busted his face. - Stairs? - Yeah, I'm clumsy. - Let me go grab you something. - I don't think he has anything, Leo. - Well, maybe we'll get a chance to find out if you can exercise a little bit of patience. - Why would you? Look at this place. - Look, I've known the guy forever, okay? Just fucking trust me. - I just don't think it's-- - Louis, just fucking trust me, okay? Shut the fuck up and play it cool. - Here. Go ahead and throw that on there. You boys want to go outside and have a smoke and talk in the back? I'll be damned, sorry boys. I remember everything we did, Leo. Goddamn everything we ever saw, everybody we ever met. Those fucking whores we'd pick up one night, next day go back and pick 'em up and take our money back from 'em. Yeah, there's nothing I forgot, man. I wish there was but you know, that's not how it turned out. I mean, fuck man, I haven't seen you in 11 months and you show up at my fucking front door. Where the fuck have you been? - Phil, I don't have a phone. See, my cousin and I, here, are in a bit of a pickle and if you could just help us score something, maybe just spot us a few bucks and we'll be back tomorrow-- - What do you guys want me to do? Give you money to buy the thing that ruined my entire fucking life? I'd rather shoot you right now in my own fucking backyard, man. You want to die? Be a man and get it over with. Look at your fucking self in the mirror for a second. When was the last time you did that, huh? This isn't you. - Well I'm quite certain it's me. - No, it's not. - No, I can assure you it's me. The same flatulent bastard I've always been. Your friend. - Then let me help you. - Give us some money. - I'll take you to see somebody. - No, as matter of fact, don't do that. Don't take us to go see some fucking Christ pusher, preaching some false fucking bullshit. - I got help, man. People were able to help me. It can work, Leo. - No. You listen to me, you give me what the fuck I need. You know what I need today. Just talk, man. You just gotta talk to somebody. - Oh talk talk talk. Give me the shit I need today, put it in my fucking veins so I can get back on my feet. - There's nothing here for you, man. You ever want to get out, you can come back. Now, if you'll excuse me. I think it's about time I have to bake a fucking ham. I got fucking company coming over tonight. I'm gonna ask you guys to leave now. Adam Jay? - Oh fuck. Adam, help me! Motherfucker! - Kicked the bucket. - Jenny Day Time? - Journeyed north, to my dismay. - Mick? - You got a number in there? - Yeah, an address, too. - Good. - You remember this guy? - Sure, an Irish bastard. I met him at a party once. Adam, bless his soul, was kind enough to give me an address. - Well, you want to, you want to just try his house? - Got nothing to lose. Alrighty, here goes nothing. - Should I come in with you? - No, no. You stay here. Safer in the car. - Don't forget about me, okay Leo? - Louis, I won't. Don't be silly. - You promise me, all right? - Louis, listen to me. It's you and me against the entire world. All right. - What the fuck was that? - Mick. You remember me, it's Leo. - Did you fucking just call me a mick? - That's right, I called you Mick. - Did you just fucking call me a mick on me own fucking porch? I should fucking kill you right here. - Mick, just relax. We met at the party sometime ago, I can assure you. - Neal. Neal! - Okay, all right. All right. - What the fuck are you doing? My name is fucking Neal. Neal! - Neal. Shit. Genuine mistake, I beg your pardon. I do apologize. - I think I do remember ya. - You do? - Oh that's right. Yeah, yeah. Ross' party about eight months back. - That's right. How the fuck do you know where I live? I don't fucking know you. I met you for like one time for less than an hour. - Yes, and I remember that it was you, precisely, telling me exactly what you sell. - Are you armed? - What? - Are you fucking armed? Do you have weapons on ya? Like knives, chains, guns, something like that. - No, I'm unarmed. You can pat me down if you like. - All right. There. Look at you, look at you. You're fucking knocking on death's door, aren't ya? - I'm more like sitting in his living room. - I know that face, I do. I know that face. I've seen it before. See, you've come here thinking that I'm gonna help ya? Put you out of your fucking misery, huh? I look at it. Two days. - Three days. Don't you fucking try pulling anything on me. - No, nor would-- - Save it! - All right. - I don't need your fucking excuse before you're on the fucking ground and I've got my hands wrapped around your fucking neck and I'm squeezing the fucking life out of ya... That's what will happen. So don't you give me an excuse. Don't you fucking try pulling anything because you will fail. You will fucking fail. - All right. - Now, do you have any money? I've got a car. - Fuck a car. Fuck a car! It's a really nice car. - Oh, it's a really nice car. This is your car? Do you own it? Did you buy it? Do you have the pink slip for it? Let me ask you a question. What did you would happen here? Hmm? When you came here, what did you think would happen? When you came here unannounced to unfamiliar territory, what was the endgame you had in mind? - No idea. - I want you to say it. - Oh it's funny to you, is it? It's a game? We're laughing. - You're in. What do you like? Was it, wait, wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Is it rock? No. Ice? You like ice. You're an ice man. - H. - Oh H. - Is it just you? - Just me, just one hit. - Just you. What about that wee skitter in the car? - That's my cousin and he's going sober. So you're just gonna fucking throw him under the bridge then? - What the fuck does he matter to you? - What the fuck does he matter to me! You're a fucking waste. A waste of fucking vitality, that's what you are. You're a fucking walking waste, walking waste, walking waste. Still, I may not like you, I don't, I may even despise you, I do, but that doesn't mean I can't use you. - I'm not sucking your dick. - Who the fuck said anything about me, you sucking my dick? Who? I didn't say that. Do I look like a fucking poof to you? Huh? Look, look, look. Look, look look look. There was this guy, I was gonna have pull a job for me, and he dropped out, he dropped out of the job last minute. - So? - So I'm looking at you wondering if you're the new fucking guy, right? Because you have a car, right, and there's that fucking guy out there, right, so there's two, twos better than one. Twos better than fucking one, right? - What's the job? - It's simple. It's a simple job. - All right, walk me through it. - It's just a small liquidation. Just a small liquidation. How bad does it hurt? Huh? How bad does it hurt? The desperation of your mind, huh? Desperation of your body. How long do you think you can last, huh? - I'll fucking do anything. - You wait here. Did you get it? - Nope. - What do you mean? You were in there for so long. What's this? What we gotta do. What do you mean what we gotta do? - This, Louis, we gotta do this. - What? We gotta do this guy? - Certainly, Louis, you're not gonna have to do the guy, okay, but I can assure you we are gonna have to kill the man. - No. What are you talking about? What are-- - Louis, what do you want from me? I'm not in the physical or the mental state to be driving around all day looking for Waldo. But if we have a sure thing, think it's a little bit easier. You can hold on just a little bit longer and the deal is we do this and we each take home 50 bags tonight. Just imagine that for a second. Wrap your brilliant mind around that, take a lap with it. That's like three months. - It's an eternity. We don't have to hurt anymore. If it doesn't work out, we'll take the car out of town and we'll try and get something for it and surely we won't get 50 bags. Luck is being prepared when the opportunity presents itself and this, my friend, this opportunity, this opportunity is pure gold. You can do this. How's that eye feel? - A little better. Peas smell like shit. - All right, well keep the shitty on peas there for vanity purposes only then. We got a few stops to make. - Motherfucker! - Who's this? - Neal said we gotta pick something up from the guy. - God damn. Oh shit, that's what I needed. You know? Oh fuck, shit, man I'm sorry. Where the fuck are my fucking manners, man? Fucking, you boys want a glass of water? I got these fucking bendy straws, man, the other day, from the dollar store. I swear to god, it makes drinking water so much fun. All right. Okay, it's all right, it's okay. Let's talk about your fella. - Alright. - Listen, I'm not gonna lie to ya. I've never even met the guy. - Why does Neal want him dead? - Shit, why does anybody want anyone dead in this business? Over 70 fucking thousand people have died in the drug war since 2006, did you know that? Now, they're talking about moms, dads, kids, sons. You name it. It's fucking dead. Over what, over fucking money. Now it's all once... A conscious decision to kill all these innocent fucking bystanders. Now when the wolves come to your fucking land, there's not enough meat to go around, what do you do? It's not a what when somebody has to go down in this business. It's just what we do. Sometimes a few lambs fall into prey. I'm sure that's something you can understand, right? - What exactly does this fellow sell? - Motherfucker's bringing in so much dope. He can get the entire fucking city high every goddamn night if he wanted to. That's what the motherfucker's doing, he's expanding. - Well isn't that just fucking perfect. Neal's got us under the impression we got to fucking whack some Bob Cratchit bastard. Shit! Fuck! - All right. The preliminary work. If I was gonna ask you what's the easiest way to kill a man, what would you say? - A bullet. - You're probably fucking right, but you're not gonna get a fucking gun through that door. Not even a knife for that matter. So there it is. - Oh, isn't that great. I'm armed with a fucking string. - You pull that string around his fucking neck and the motherfucker's gonna be paralyzed, he'll be dead within two minutes. Now, either one of you motherfucker's got a phone? - I'm certain that we don't have a bloody phone. - Fucking ask you... Here you go. That's a burner. You break that burner after you're done but you make sure you call Neal first. All right, you let him know the shit went well. Also, you see Pigeon, you tell him I said go fuck his mother. Make sure he knows that. - One to the next, is it? Irish bastard. - Who is it then? - Neal, it's Leo. - Leo. Leo, Leo, Leo, Leo. Leo the fucking lamb. Did Oscar inform you the right person? - Of course he did. We're going over there in a minute but listen here, fellow, you had us under the impression we were going to pick off a fucking regular Joe. Why, it turns out, we got to take out the fucking next Frank Lucas. - I told you that he was a drug user, a big time fucking user, which he is. Now all sick people are like you, Leo. You should remember that. - Shut your Irish trap and admit you lied to me. - What the fuck did you just say to me? What the fuck did you just say to me? Fuck you, you skinny cunt. Doesn't matter if I fucking lied to you. It doesn't matter if I fucking lied to you. Leo. 50 fucking bags each, Leo. Where the fuck are you gonna get that? All you have to do is show back up here at my house with his phone as proof. Once you do that... Don't you fucking call here again. I will hunt you down like the Grim fucking Reaper and I will saw off your fucking knob! - So we're doing this? - Look, Louis. I don't want to see you get hurt, all right. So if you want me to take you back to my place or even, I can probably drop you off at Paper Boy's. - Why? - Louis, I don't want to see you get fucking hurt again, okay? I had no intention that this little sleigh ride was gonna take a turn like this. - I want to stay. I want to stay. - Louis, you silly bastard. No, we're gonna take you back-- - I don't want to leave you, Leo. How are you not scared right now? - Why I guess I just... Listen, I'm gonna let you in on a little secret, my little secret. Every street I walk down, every person I meet, I take comfort in knowing that I'm the most crazy, unstable person in the room and that I'm willing to do the things that nobody else is willing to do. - Oh for fuck's sake! Will you let me get high in peace? I'm sorry. Who's, who's there? Who's knocking on my door? Hello? Who's fucking there? Shit, shit. - Pigeon? - Gary. - Oh shit. - Pigeon lives here though. He knows you're coming. - All right, that's good. - Come in. Anyways, so listen, I walk over to this guy and I strike up a conversation with him, right, and as we're talking away, you know, I don't, fucking something about his job or whatever, I'm really feeling like I'm making a connection with this guy, right, a real connection, right, you know we're laughing, he's hot, it's all going great. As am I as staring into this guy's eyes, the lightest, most beautiful fucking blue eyes I have ever seen, he's hands creeps up to his fucking mouth. - Don't you fucking. - To flick some pasta off his lip, man. It wasn't even sexual the way he did it. I'm not gonna fucking lie, though, the shit turned me on. - I don't care what you do with your dudes, it doesn't bother me, I just don't want to hear about it, okay? - All right. I'm sorry about that, boys. - No, no. Quite all right. Pigeon, I presume. I'll let him know you've arrived. - Amber, this is Leo. Leo, Amber. - Nice to meet you. Pleasures all mine. - Some of the best shit right here. This is tapper's dream. You got your green card? Your medical marijuana permission slip? - Why, certainly not. - Oh man, that's too bad. Here you go, baby. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I gotta tell you, man. It's like a kid in a candy store, you go into these places. They fucking jars and jars and jars of nugs. I mean some of the best and then the edibles. Of course, I don't know if you do edibles or not but I mean, they've gotten way out of hand. I didn't know it went past fucking pot brownies until like two years ago. Now they got fucking ganja coffee and pot butter ice cream, peanuts, pretzels, fucking taffy man. Medicated lip balm. - Well if you don't use use then humor me your business with Neal. - Well, this business can actually be quite profitable if you know what you're doing. I offer service the generally most people won't do. - Why do I need you? - You only get one fucking shot at flawless execution, man and as I'm sure you heard today from Oscar, this guy, tonight, might be a little bit tricky. - On his way to the top. Making his way, yeah. - Such an ambitious fellow certainly has a name. - Sure he does. Skinner. - Does he have a first name? - I don't know. Could be that. Did you bring a partner with you? - My cousin, he's in the living room. - Good. Good. The two of you, this job should be easy as pie. Cops could give a fuck about finding a drug dealer dead in his own house, as long as you're not there when they find him. You uh, you think you can actually do this? - Lives a little ways out of town, doesn't he? - Safer for business. Maybe he likes the quiet. Now. You tell him you'll take whatever you can for this, all right? Keep the conversation light and sweet. - He'll be all right. - Now, when you get up there, his security's gonna ask you for a password. - What the fuck does he need a password for? - Look man I don't question what the fuck these guys do. All you have to say is Lemons. - Lemons? - Yeah. - Okay. - Good. Good. Go with God, my brother. - Louis. I'll see you in a wink. - What's your business here? I'm here for Skinner. - Password! Lemons. - Come here. - Sit, please. Skinner. - Louis. - That's a cute name. First or last? - First, you? - Good. My god. Mind if I ask what happened to your eye there? - I tripped on some stairs a couple hours ago. - Gosh, how'd you do that? - I was in a hurry. - Well I'm sorry to hear it but if I am speaking honestly, I do like a man with some scars. So. What could I do for you, Lou? I mean, you don't mind me calling you that, right? - Um, I heard you sold junk here. - Really? Now who told you that? - I um, I actually don't really remember it. It was sort of a passing conversation. I don't even really recall when. - Oh but you remember the specific address of my house that somebody told you? - I uh, I got $50. - $50? To buy junk? - Yeah. - Which somebody told you I sold here. - Yeah. - And you don't remember who. - I'm sorry, is there a problem? 'Cause I can just leave. - Oh, no, no. I'm not asking you to leave, Lou. I'm just curious. Naturally, you bring up some questions. What questions? - First and foremost, you're someone I've never met, I've never seen, you're sitting in my office in my home and you can't remember who told you about me? Really, very few know who I am. Now. Looky, Lou. I'm going to trust you. You see, everybody that I sell to knows my shipment comes into tomorrow. Now granted, you may have gotten your information from someone who wasn't aware of this but I'm sorry, honey. I can't sell you my last lemon. That's for my girls. - I'm sorry, I didn't know you were dry. I think I'm gonna-- - What are you gonna do, just cut out, just like that? - You don't really have what I'm looking for. - Lou, easy baby. Just breathe, sit down. On the contrary. I have what every young man's looking for. I have pure velvet purse pussy and I have it clean, cheap, and young. You look pretty young, Lou. How old are you? - 21. - I got one of them. A couple of 23s, 22s, and 19 even. What are you into, cowboy? - Look, I'm not here for that. - Well he walks into my home looking to create a partnership with my business and I offer you extracurricular activity and you deny me of that service? - Look, I didn't come here-- - What are you gonna do, disrespect me? - No. - I'm into relationships. That's how I frolic. So why don't you flip me the 50, go fuck one of my girls for fun and come back tomorrow for your fix? Show me you're real. - What the fuck are we supposed to do? Just fucking sit here? Yeah, man. We wait. - I will slit your fucking throat. Is something-- - We fucking wait! That's it. There's my babies. If that doesn't make you horny, nothing will, Lou. God, so beautiful. Come to Daddy. Make him better. That's a good baby. Let's get you fixed up. Here we go. You ready, baby? So good. So beautiful. Oh baby. Buck. Take Claire to room three, make her comfortable. - Yes, Daddy. - You like that one, huh? Why don't you follow Buck for your fuck? Have fun, honey. - Merry Christmas, Louis. - Why do they call you Pigeon, anyway? 'Cause I always find my way home. All right, what the fuck happened in there? - He didn't have any fucking drugs. What's the house like? - He's got a, he's got two guys at the front and they pat you down and walk you around. You said he's completely dry? - That's what he told me. He said, he said he had a shipment coming in tomorrow. - What's the room like? - It's wide. Real nice. The rest of the house? - He's got some girls there. I think they might be whores or something. I don't know. - What's he look like? - Big. - Shit. Fuck. Oh that's fucking just fantastic. Would you just fucking relax, please? - Oh it's dones. I'm gonna fucking kill him with my claws and I'm gonna wrap a shoelace around his fucking neck. Are you fucking kidding me? - Listen to me. Do you hear me? Are you fucking listening? All right. All you got to do is get him a position just like this. Keep your hands nice and tight, your grip just like so. Then you don't stop squeezing until he's fucking quiet. - Jesus fucking Christ. - Now, since he's out of drugs, you tell him you're there for a girl. Take this. You look like a guy who could use a fuck. - Go fuck your mother. Louis. You fucking sit tight. - How long you been an addict, Lou? - No. I'm not. I'm not an addict. - Oh no? You're not? - I'm not a fucking addict! No! All right? I just like getting high. - All right. - Big room to be sitting in solitude, huh? You type to prefer that kind of thing? - Oh quite certainly and I must say this is just the most marvelous abode I've ever seen. - Appreciate that. Put a lot of work into it, a lot of time and thought. You a working man? - Certainly have my days. - Of course. Where are my manners? Skinner. - Oh, Leo. - Great name. - Why, thank you. - What's your sign? - I'm a Scorpio. - Oh, lovely. I'm a Taurus myself but to be frank, I don't give much credence to Astrology. So, you're here for a girl then? - Yes. - Wonderful. And uh, who told you this was the place to come? - Oh, Adam. You know Adam? - Adam? I got a Atkins that comes here, Alexander but Adam. - Just a fellow I knew who spoke of this place and I've, quite certainly fellow like myself could use a little tenderness. - I love it. So, what kind of girls are you into, Leo? You just tell me what you want. - Why, I certainly like all of the flavors of the palette. - Good. Not a picky guy, huh? - Well, never have been. - Me either. You know, it's funny, I tend to gravitate towards picky people but myself. So uh, what do you say? Shall I bring them in, show you what I got? Bambi. He's hard of hearing. Bambi, honey. Hey. You all right? - Oh, just fine, thank you. - It's okay to be nervous. A lot of guys get scared their first time with one of my girls. I got married guys coming in here twice a week. Love blossoms. Makes them appreciate their own women even more. So, we both think. God. If you want more than a woman. Bambi, Jasmine, Ariel, Elsa. This is Leo. So uh, what do you think? I mean, I've got other options but these are the house favorites. Tend to be more reused. Come on, babies, give him a little spin. Do I not have the best? - Do you believe in angels? - Can't say that I do. Do you? - I'm not really sure. - Are you familiar with the Greek God mythology, Leo. - Certainly, I've read in depth of the subject. - The chicks have a scholar. Let me tell you a story. You see, my brother, he's a ship captain in Florida. Ever since he could walk, he just loved the water. Riding on it, being in it. Just looking at it, even. When I was younger I tried to figure out why he had such a fascination for it. You know. I don't even think he... He was just drawn to it, something inside him. He could not be The Greek God Poseidon, god of the sea, he was within him. Not a conscious entity but a shape of energy. But this is true for many people, I'm certain. I mean, just take for example someone who has built an empire for themself, a corporate CEO, a country leader, rock star. Now these people. Aphrodite, goddess of beauty and pleasure. This stuff here is so much more. I present to you the utmost treasure. The goddess of the self, before your very eyes. All you go to do is pick a body. - She'll do. Elsa. Come here, baby. Sit. All right, girls. Go upstairs, get ready for sleep. Daddy will be up soon to tuck you in. Bambi, honey. You go upstairs, get our bed ready. There won't be anymore business tonight, okay? He's a little slow but I love him. Now that's my last. Guess it's gonna be Oxy for me and the others. All right, hold it. That's it, baby. How's that, baby? That will be 150 cash. Bambi! - What the fuck was that? - Just fucking relax. This shit happens all the time. - He didn't even have a gun. - Well let's hope to fucking god he found one, okay? - Where's your fucking wallet? Give me your fucking wallet. Where's your fucking wallet? - I used to watch the news with my dad when I was a kid. Something horrible like a murder or a robbery would come on and I'd ask him how people were capable of being so terrible to each other. You want to know what he would say to me? "What's the difference between 10 tigers locked in a cage together and 10 humans locked in a cage together?" And I fucking loved to hear the answer. So I'd say, what's the difference? This is what he would tell me. "The only difference is is that humans get to know each other first before tearing each other apart. That's it." My philosophy in life is, if you're able to kill something you're able to kill anything. - Motherfucker, come here.
