Lie down. Cover yourself up! What do you want? Nothing. What do you whistle for? Is it Sara? Is it Sara, right? Let's say it is. Are you her husband? Yes... Why are you looking for her? Seeing her. Get the hell out of here, or I'll... I would be able to... Of what? You would be able to what? Of what! Please, leave her alone. And why would I do that? Because... she's mine. I don't want you to take her from me! You... she has been yours. She told you so? How long has it been? How long are you planning... I know it all... She was yours... And others, before us. Find another one. You know, and you don't get angry? That's why I ask you to leave her alone. She had mentioned something, about you. I didn't think you were like this. You have seen it with your own eyes. Get out of here, already! She is coming with me tonight. Get out... I don't want to kill you... Get out! What's going on, Dad? Nothing. Go back to bed. Yeah, dad. Dad... Dad... Dad! Come... Come... There dad... Come... Outside, dad. Come... There is a guy, dad. Left in a pool of blood, dad. Wait for me outside, okay? Yeah dad. Yeah dad. You look like... You look like a sleeping horse... Horse standing asleep... Dad, dad. Come dad! Come, outside. Outside, dad! On the blood, dad. Come! Look at this dad! He's dead! He took a long time to die. Come again? He took a long time to die. Get him! I was with the dead man! He was telling me things that I didn't understand. And then he complained, awghh! As if I had a bone stuck in his neck, dad! And then, he stiffened, dad. I spoke to him, but he did not respond. Why did you hit him, Dad? Throw him out! The jacket is good, Dad! Leave it. I'll buy you a new one. Hurry up! Check this out, Dad! Hurry up! Hurry up! He doesn't fit, Dad! Fold him! Tuck him in. Push him in, quick! It's done, dad! - Give me a hand. - Sure, dad! No one should know about this, ok? - No, dad. - Nobody! - What is it, Esteban? - Wake up, We're leaving! What are you waiting for! Get up! - Get up! - I'm coming! Get your stuff together, now! So where are they going? And at such an early hour? Couldn't you wait until the sun warmed up us a bit? Why are you in such a hurry? - Where are we going? - I don't know. And so? You can go your own way if you don't agree. I'm the boss here! So you're the boss and we'll be damned! Quickly! I'm on my way to get the truck. I don't know what happened... Because something must have happened. Esteban is crazy. He has already... But not at dawn. This is due to that young woman... It is always because of her. Everything is always horrible with Esteban, and so useless! He will hear you! Instead of being there basking in the sun, the blind fucker... should be hauling planks, or something. And you! Get the hell out of here! You are doing great! It is more important to get the job done, than looking at the girls' butts! Are you mad, dad? I don't mean at me, but the other one, the one who stayed behind. Do you remember? The one that did not fit in the hole! Enough. We walked many miles. He is already far away. No one can hear us, dad. Sara! Sara... come back! Wait up! Hi girls, why are you so lonely? - You are to blame. - Why is that? The way you wiggle when you walk. So they... The way you wiggle when you walk... Esteban tells me the same thing all the time. I like to be watched by men. Let them imagine things. Why are you like that, Sara? Let's say... It pleases me. When you grow up, when you're with a man.... you will understand. Why do you get angry with Esteban? Esteban is not a man! I mean a young man, that doesn't inspire disgust. And why don't you leave him? I will break up with him when I want to! I may be leaving with Paco today. I was leaving with him last night, you know? He was whistling at me, but I could not leave. He will be over there, in the other yard. Where we slept last night? Aren't you going to pack your things? What Paco wants from me is my body. What about Esteban? Esteban... I have already told you that he is impotent. Good for nothing! But there are other men, quite different... All I know is: Paco says I'm beautiful. Everyone who has met me wants to... I have given pleasure to them all. But I feel nothing. My body refuses. Pleasure? To me there is only pain. It's the only thing I've known. They kiss me and do like this: And me instead... I don't even understand why I kiss them. I think this is due to... that it scares me that the pleasure can be so... Strong! Just like pain! I choose pain. Because I already know it. If pleasure hurts like this, I... I couldn't resist it. Not again... Fuck this! Wow man, that was a good bullfight! Are you newcomers? Yes. Son... you will never leave me. Neither do I you. Why Dad? Why will you leave me? I don't want! What would I do without you? There is a God, son. A God whom I once cursed. Because he made you this way. But now I am grateful to him. Hey, dad... Who do you prefer, Sara or me? No... that is different. Sara is other business. Sara... Do you remember, Dad? They are in for a big scare! Who? Those who go to the field, those who remove the stones. And see him! Yes son, a big scare. Just imagine. To scare them even more, nothing should be said. Yeah, dad. Yeah, dad. One other thing, Sergio... If someone were to find that... then you and I would suffer a lot. We could no longer be together. You would never see me again, Sergio. No, dad! No dad...! Where's Sara? She is not back! She is mine! Alma has come alone. Ask her. If you are so interested in this woman... Learn to take care of her. Alma... Alma...! - Where did she go? - I don't know! Do not talk to her! Beat her, beat her! She is a wicked woman! I don't know... She went to the other field! Finish her off! My little child! What happened here? I tripped when the girl came out! Give me a hand. Give me a hand! What do you want?! Me... I came looking for you. I am not going back to you. Why? I don't want to go back with you! Because I disgust you! Because as a man I am worth less than anyone else! Because you are sick of my sterile caresses! Because you want to sleep next to a body that is not deformed! Next to a lover who won't let you down! Is that? You bitch! That's why you'll leave me! Yes... Yes! That's why! That's why! That's why! That's why! That's why! Get out! Go away if you don't want him to meet you here and... Your friend? The one waiting for you last night? He won't come... What do you know? He will not come. That's what I know. You already slept with him. He is no longer interested in you. We will find out. I can't get enough of you. If you want to wait for him, be my guest. If he doesn't come, you can come back with me. You know that. Where are you living? A long way from here. Next sunday. Over there, by that tree. Good evening. Good evening. Who is that old guy traveling with you? That clown. Not an old man! It's just that he's got all his bones broken. Is he your father? My husband... My spouse. Dress up. It is too late. When will we see you again? Would you like to? As you did not... I thought that... Tomorrow, whenever you want! Tomorrow, then. Thank you. Neither today. No... but still I love you. It's not your fault. I would never ever... Nobody ever made me enjoy. Who was the first one? Esteban? He was not as crooked as he is now. He was living with my mother. He was hers. But he never called me "daughter". One day... When I was home alone... Estela! Are you here alone? My mother went to the market with Sergio. Come closer. You are stuffed. You know what Sergio asked me? He wanted to know why you weren't like him. Why did you have bumps in your chest? I saw him as other men with my mother. Take your hands off her, bastard! Swine! Swine! Swine! Swine! After that, mom said we were leaving. But she dared not leave him. He found a job as a bricklayer. And he came home with some money. And he took mom, Sergio and me on a pilgrimage. We travel by train. At one station, Sergio and I went down to get food. Esteban and Mom stayed on the train. Another train came out of nowhere; they collided. Many were killed. Mi mom died. Esteban was in the hospital for a long time. He came out crippled. The three of us together went to live in another house. - Sergio, you will sleep over here. - Yes, dad. Nite, dad. You and I will be sleeping here. Let's go to sleep now. Get undress, now. From now on... you will be my wife. Are you afraid... of me? I will not harm you. Want me to help you? Take it off! He kissed me, he drooled all over, and fondled me. And then he said that it would have been better if he had been killed in the hospital. That there was no reason for him to go on living. That his body was now worth nothing. That he was no longer a man. And he cried all over me. And I fell asleep. No. Esteban was not my first lover. Good thing you are the foreman! This has to be done, or I won't get the job. Do you like her, Juan? Do you like her? Your wife is very pretty. Would you do it with her? You're drunk, Esteban! Doesn't she look like she was made for sex? I don't know, Esteban... She is like fire! She is like fire on my... bed. Everyone is running after her! But I am the only one who owns her! Me! You know? Me! But I... As if dead. Is it true everything he has said? I hated it with all my soul, and I felt as if someone had been cheating on me forever. Because what I thought was love, hurts... do harm. I should have met you earlier. Before all this... But that's how things turned out. Now, you already know. I love you. You must leave all that behind, all of it! I forgive you, as the first man in your life. I want you to get this straight Sara, I have been the first man in your life. Yes, yes... Yes! I love you. It will last forever. Will you marry me? - Me? - Yes, you. Paco! Eat something, everyone is ready now. He has a fever. I will take care of him. Go to work. The money you get will be more useful than the care you can give him. Come on, hurry up! Hurry up! Cover youself! Why? They may see you... If someone comes in here... So what? It could be Sergio and... And don't you think he's seen my body before? Whatever! Leave that alone! Leave it! Give it to me! I was just messing with you! But if you want me to leave, I'll do it at once! No! Forgive me! Forgive me! Don't leave me! Do whatever you want, except that! Girl, at least go get some alohol for tonight! Don't leave me! Please! Don't leave me! No! - Shall I go with you? - No! I go alone. I can't stand it anymore. Everything bothers him! I hate him with all my heart! To him and to everyone! Pigs, Pigs! Marry me! And I believed him! I did not ask for anything. I never asked him to live as a couple. I should have known he wouldn't deliver. Stupid me! And you get out of here! Leave me alone. Why do you listen to what doesn't concern you? Dad! Dad! - Fill this bottle with alcohol. - Alcohol? Take this and the cold will go away. No, I don?t want it. Go ahead, have some. No, I don't like it. Want something milder? I don't drink alcohol. No alcohol of any kind. All I want is for you to fill my bottle so I can leave. Don't tell me you're leaving now? Why haven't you been back since that afternoon? I dunno. I asked your blonde friend about you. She didn't tell you? Come on. Have some. It's all right! I'm sorry, girl! Look, I'll pour you another one. The hard part is the first one. The following ones are not felt. Go on. Have it. Look, you are all soaked! Go on. Drink up to the bottom, girl! Do you marry me? And now, the woman of fire performing the dance of the seven veils! You shameless! Dad! Dad! Have a look, dad! We're back! Let's see how the... Shut up! Keep going! Get out of here! Hurry up! What should I do? What should I do? I told you so. Dummy, Someday it will happen to you. Better if it is now with someone you like. And on the other hand, you are right to be afraid. Men are beasts that hurt you. Of course, since you don't break your back carrying the instruments, right? - Shut up, don't bother him! - And why should I keep quiet? Your boyfriend? Come on! He wants what the rest of them want. To get laid, then you will never see him again. Hey! What are you talking about? Are they making fun of me? You are talking about men, Or what?! Go to bed now! This freak who never goes to sleep! - Are you going with Luiciano tonight? - Mhm. But you don't want him or anyone else? So why do you do it? Because... To see if I ever get to feel, what I haven't felt before. Or because I'm slut, I don't know. Alma... it's enough! Let's go! Go to sleep now! Where's Sergio? Where is my son? He didn't come to dinner. Enough! I go for Sergio. Mom! My dad doesn't love me anymore. My dad doesn't love me anymore. He hit me, mom! What's up? Estela is dying, she just had a baby girl. Sara is her name. Where are they going? Don't deny me a drink! A drink. Give me a drink! Do you want some? Come with me. Give me that bottle! Mom! Mom! Mom, doesn't want to play with me! No, my son. I love you so much. I didn't want to hit you. But you mustn't say a word.... If somebody ever gets to know... I'll go to jail and... And you would be left alone. Do you want them to put me behind a fence? We would never see each other again. No dad! No dad! Where you have been? I went for a walk. By yourself? Were you... with a man? There we go again! Here I come? Think so? Surely you were just talking... - Surely you did... - I did what? Do you want to hear that I was with another man? Hear me even if you don't want to! I was with another man! And you want to know what we were doing? - He ripped off my dress! - No! And he watched me, just as I am now! But he's a complete man! Not like you! He doesn't crawl while walking! He's alive! Leave me alone! I love you. I love you. You have to be mine! You must enjoy with me! I'm your husband! I have every right to! Poor thing... I wish everything were different, at least once. What do I know? I have never felt that. Do you know Esteban? For a brief moment, I almost came to love you. Why is it so? But seeing your face... it's all over! Let's start the show. One step back, please! Behold the terrible Himalayan bear! And his reckless tamer! To the priestess of dance! To the orchestra man! To the doggy professors! Let's see, let the show begin! Dance! I say dance! What's wrong? Nothing. I just got dizzy dancing. Don't you think so? Is that the reason why I am afraid? And I'm horribly ashamed! What is it? I told you. Last night... That's why I was late. He... My boyfriend! Excuse me for being silly, but... He asked me to go with him and not to school! To the theatre... Afterwards we went to the park. To the dark corner... And then.... To a hotel. The best thing to do is to run away with him, right? Did you enjoy it? I want to know if it was satisfactory? Yes. I never imagined it would be like that. Marry him? Hurry up then. He has already met his needs with you. What's the point? Just the same, until he gets you pregnant. And then, he would say goodbye forever. You would have paid the price or being a woman. Face up to things! But I love him, and he loves me in return! And besides, I don't want to be like you. And how do you say I am? You are right not to want to be like me. Among other things because... I'm pregnant. What?! Yeah, Luciano... Since I was in his store that afternoon... I have only been with him. And what are you going to do? Luciano... I have something to tell you. Well, say it now. I am... I've already waited another eight days... Today is the day, so.... I am positive. I am pregnant. What do you plan to do? It's just that... What am I going to do? I don't know. You should know about it. Are you positive? I've already told you. I wasn't going to tell you, but... Well, it's a bad thing. Of course; now you must make your choice. What?! What we will do! Because something must be done. I am... I am very happy. Quite happy. Because I will have your child. My son? Come on! Who guarantees it's mine? Me! It's yours, Luciano! And you think I buy that? You think I'm going to buy that story, that I am the father. - But Luciano, I swear to you! - Come on, get out of here! A child... Come on, man... Now you come up with this. So, what? Then, look for someone to buy your story. Hey! Close the door, and don't let anyone see you. Now you do it for the money... You are a...! Stop hitting me! He is going to kill her. Leave it. Stay out of it. She deserves it for being a whore! - This is not the first time. - But he hadn't hit her that hard. Your daughter deserves an equal beating. Leave her out of this! I will settle it with her. Your daughter is on the wrong path. With men, most likely. She has become very hypocritical, pretends to go to school, and comes very late at night. That's my problem. I told you before. Sara is not working today. Let's go. What are you waiting for? Come on! You are feverish. - Has he left? - Yeah. Are you hungry? I brought you some coffee. That beast! Esteban? Esteban! It hurts! It hurts! You are bleeding heavily. If it doesn't stop, we need to call a doctor. It's mine... Let it not be like the other times... I didn't know... But I'm no longer the same... I don't want to lose it! She did it! MURDER OF THE MECHANIC They found his corpse half-buried - Dad... - Let's go! Hurry up, Sergio! Come on! You can stay if you want, I'm leaving! A man named Luciano accused her of robbery. She was taken to the prison hospital. Someone must go to see her. The poor thing must feel very lonely. - Ruth! Where are you? - Here I come! "The last occupants of that lot, were itinerant circus performers" who are wanted for questioning by the police." Dad! Dad! Where is Sara, dad? Today is visiting day, see if anyone comes to see you. How do I pray? How do I pray? How do I pray, oh God? I am praying... Am I doing it right? You don't answer... But it is not possible... Because I believe in you. No, God! Please forgive me, God! It was somewhere, Somewhere else. I do not remember. It's just that nobody taught me. You exist... Why do you allow this? Why are you allowing this to happen to me? My only wish is that no one hurts me... And I don't harm anyone. I wanted to have this child... And now it's gone. I came because I assumed you were alone. Are you playing? My mother and Esteban went out, right? Since Sara was taken I've been waiting for the chance to... - Do you know where Dimas is? - No. Must be asleep, why? I'm going to run away, and for good! I'm going with my boyfriend, I came to get my things. Alma! someone help me! Hurry up! Here comes Dimas! He is not coming here! He has another emergency! Farewell... I must seize the moment. Almita... Almita... Where are you, Almita...? What are you doing, Almita? - Here you are! - Let me go, filthy animal! So you were going to get out, right? Let me go! You think that because I can't see, I don't notice what's going on. Sergio... Sergio! Sergio! Sergio! Shut up! Sergio! Shut up, I said! I have 20 gold coins. No one knows I have them with me. Sergio! Sergio! Dad! Dad, they are gone! - Who are they? - Dimas and Cruz. They left me alone! What happened? Dimas fought with her in there, she ran over there almost naked! And then Dimas stood there yelling at her, the same things you yell at Sara! He ran but could not catch her. Then Cruz arrived and told her that Alma had left with a man. Cruz began to cry and ran after Alma. And I went to feed Tony and the dogs. And then Cruz returned with two chargers and a very large truck, A very large truck, And he said to me, you tell your father that it's better for everyone to go their own way, took their belongings, and Dimas' battery! Sara! You are free. The hunchback paid your bail. - It's time to bed. - Yes dad. Yeah, dad. Don't look at me. Thanks. We have money for another day. You... This is a new dish, dad! Yes, yes, please don't break it. You and I will work on something else. Also, the musician left. We must get rid of anim... Give me the coffee, son. - Go check the animals! - Sure. More, Dad. More! I'm going to sell Tony (the bear) and the dogs. And I will look for a job in construction. The circus is over for us. Yes, it will be better. What about your watch? At a pawnshop. I am a great burden to you. No! No! I'm going to talk to the foreman. Let's get rid of all those fleas! You are dirty! He is full of fleas! In this heat, the bath will do you a lot of good. - Right? - Sure. - I bet it is. - Where's dad? He went to look for work. That day, when you were gone... We missed you very much. - Really? - Dad cried every night. What about you? Were you thinking of me? You're not leaving again? No... It's my turn! It's going to be very cold! This is my turn, now! Shall I soap you up? Why are you crying? Are you mad at me? Thank you... Thank you! Thank you! More please, my love! This we have just done, no one must know about it. Got it? Nobody! No. Nobody! Nobody! They would prevent us from doing so. And you don't want that, do you? I prefer this way. This way. Always... this way! And I want you this way, my love! Now I know what I need! I know and I will not lose you! Sergio... You're mine! Esteban called me a whore, because he thought I was looking for men because I liked sex, None of them had meant anything to me. I have been so many because no one has taught me what you discovered in me. I will work for you, and someday we'll go far away. No matter where, or what I have to do. You will always need me, and I will take good care of you. I will love and protect you. It will be. My love... More, my love. Sara! Sergio! I got the job. I had to toast with my colleagues! It's a miserable job, they won't even pay me well. But it doesn't matter, it will get better with time. - Do you want to have dinner? - It's a huge construction! It will take a long time to finish it. Almost one year's paid for sure! Dad! You see I am not useless! No matter how little money I make, I can provide for you and my son. And when I have some savings, we'll go to sleep in a neat room. I will buy you clothes. And maybe I'll get a job for Sergio. In construction... No! I don't think it's a good idea. Better when your position there improves. Yeah, yeah! Don't think that I abuse them. You're right! Besides, as long as we don't solve the animal issue, someone will have to take care of them. What's wrong with you? What a beauty she is, isn't she? Yeah, dad. Yeah! Yeah, dad! This is a child, poor inocent kid. - Do you want something to eat? - No, no, no. Sergio, my son! Don't fall asleep here. Go to bed now. Yeah, dad. Give me your blessing. In the name of the Father, of the son.... Go away! Go to sleep now. Don't do anything anymore. Listen to me! Back at work I heard there is going to be a group wedding, and free of charge! It is to fix the situation of people who live like us. And I want to take the chance. It costs nothing and the women will be given a sum, as a bridal dowry, got it? Got it?! I tell you that I want you to marry me! Answer me! What I did wrong? Let it be as you wish. Come with me... Sure, sure... I'm coming. I'll be there in a minute. Go now. The crime has been solved. Yesterday a vicious homeless man was casually captured, the man was drunk on the street, he accepted to have committed the stabbing murder of the man whose body was buried in a lot, whose name was Francisco Ramirez. The killer committed suicide by hanging himself with his own belt. Sara! Sergio! I'm home! He can't be blamed! God, you know I couldn't. How could I do him any harm! How could I! She's made my flesh beat that woman's damn flesh! When I saw it, I saw myself, taking revenge for the offenses of a lifetime! The failure of my blood! My jealousy! My shame! My son, the other part of myself, who takes what is mine, which others and not me have enjoyed before! Oh, God almighty! God! I can't be mad at her. However, she has exceeded the limit of offenses that a man can bear. But I have pity on her. I took pity on her. Bring all the firewood we have, all of it! Can I help you? Take Tony for a walk... far away. He needs it. Go there. He has already been locked up for a long time. Play with him, far away... What have you got with me? Why are you looking at me like that! What did I do wrong? I came home early. And so? Early... And you weren't waiting for me. I always wait for you. Since I came back from the hospital, I have not been on the street. I mean... early early. Earlier than ever. Want me to be more precise? What time was it? No matter the time. The important thing is... I saw it all. I saw it all. You and Sergio. Back there. And since you know. What do you plan to do? Are you going to kill me because your son is sleeping with me? He is quite a man! Not like yourself! Say whatever to me. You can't offend me. Nor do you hurt me. I realize this now. To kill you... Nah. Let me go! Sergio! Leave Sergio out. You're not coming with us. Sergio! I always said, whatever you did, I would never kill you... I loved you, so much... T H E E N D
