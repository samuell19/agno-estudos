Driver spends 5 minutes leaving parking space Check this out, he can't get out. It's early, and you want to watch this shit? Why do you laugh at others' misfortune? Don't worry, he won't be injured. What a drag, he's an asshole. Why should I waste my time watching this dude? Fail compilations are better, aren't they? Have you seen the video of a dude jumping from a container? They freeze the image right before he falls, right before he smashes his head against the floor. -And then they move the camera... -Yeah, right away. and show his face with his front teeth all broken. That's disgusting. -You want some? -Yeah. Good morning. -How are we doing? -All good? Hey, man, fine. Are you going to the beach? -Sure. -Check out the day. -Hi. -Good morning. Do you have some fruit? -I'll get some. -Thanks. -Excuse me. -You're the best. Hey, are you here? I haven't left yet. I'll be there at night. How's it going? Only half-up Mentally? Haha Let's hope so haha Hey we're going out tonight, right? -Yeaaaah, we'll talk -Great, kisses -Bye, guys. -See you.Take care. MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING SUNDAY, MARCH 8 2015 8:12 pm Where can I change clothes? There's a bathroom at the back to your right. OK. So what's going on? Shit, I met some people on the beach and I came to their house Come Where? Zapallar, by the beach I can't get there Hey, I know you. -Aren't you friends with Nico Zabala? -Yeah. I think I saw you somewhere. -Really, where? -At a party. At his birthday party, I think. -That might be. -Yeah, I saw you at his birthday party. -What's your name? -Vicente. -You? -Lucía. What are you doing here? Some friends invited me. I just met Francisca and Ana at the beach. They invited me. Oh, cool! Fran is Manuel's cousin, right? Yeah, Fran is my cousin. -Fran is your cousin? -Yeah. Why? -I just met her. -Really? Where? -At the beach. -Yeah, she's in the room behind mine. Great! -What's your name? -Manuel. -Manuel, I'm Vicente. -Hi. -Did you meet her at the beach? -Yeah. I was sunbathing and they came, they started talking to me and took my beers. -That's a classic, man. -Yeah, classic. She's the beer thief. I already banged her four times at the beach. Get out, man. -You're such a phony, man. -What do you know? Go ahead, bro. -What's your name, bro? -Vicente. -Vicente who? -Maldonado. I know who you are. How's that? You were Sofía's boyfriend, right? Yeah. Sofía's my cousin. I'm Manuel Larrea. -No kidding! -Yeah, man. Quite a trip! You're everybody's cousin. More or less. -Let's smoke some weed. -Where? -Somewhere else. -OK. -Where to? -Follow me, please. I can't see. Watch out. Wow! This is the shit. What an amazing view. Can I ask you something? No. What? What's the deal between you and Francisca? Why do you ask? What are we, you mean? Right. I don't know. Girlfriends, friends. It's always up to her. I don't know. She can't make up her mind. She doesn't know what she wants, but I do. I've always known... I like girls. Since when? Shit, since I was little. Have you ever liked a man? No, not really, I never fell in love. I had a boyfriend... just because... I don't know. Out of curiosity. -Yeah, maybe... -Right? That's the reason we are here on Earth. I don't know. Bullshit! -Where did that thought come from? -I don't know. From what part of my mind? Maybe it came from God. God, are you there? Is God there? "Yes, little Ana, I'm here." Imagine God is a rich, uptight guy. Of course he is! "Welcome to heaven, my dearest, how are you? I'm here on my brand new cloud." -This thing is over. -What thing? The deep conversation about... Alright then, let's just relax. Let's talk about something else. -What? -It's over. Over. -We have to go. -Yeah, right? We can't leave... -Who? -Her... -Who? -Francisca. Alone... -downstairs. -Downstairs. Come on. Let's go, we're pathetic. Why did we do this, why did I kiss you, dawg? 'Cause you love dawgs. I don't! Hi. All right, now. -How boring. -Fuckin' boring. What a drag! Don't worry, I got the magic. Were you with Ana? -Yeah. -And? And what? What were you up to? She took me to see the roof. You made out? Just a kiss. Oh, yeah? Just a goodbye kiss. What do you mean? Come on, it's not a big deal. You have an open relationship, don't you? I guess. What can we do, marry? Who do you like better, me or Ana? You. Really? Liar. -I swear. -No. Really? -Really? -I'm serious. It's boring, anyway, isn't it? What? I'd like to have the will to love someone and to be committed to a relationship. But I don't. I'm always sabotaging myself. I do like Ana, but not that much, you know? Did she suck your dick? No. OK. Relax, we only had a friendly conversation. Why did you make out, then? It came naturally after smoking some weed and... Just because. Now let's make out. No. What else can we do? Let's make out. There's nothing else to do. Like going out to dinner. What else can we smoke? Let's go shopping. We didn't ask each other anything. We just got up and kissed. How many fish can we eat? So you kissed and that was it. One kiss and that was it. That was it. It's occupied! Fuck it, let's go. So you like me. Uh-huh. Let's see. Alright, alright, alright. Let's go, guys. What are you doing here? -Are we leaving? -We're leaving, man. -Stop it. -Yes, we're leaving in 15. Let me make me a Piscola. Don't do it now, we're leaving. I got a bit left, that's enough. -Then I'll make a drum. -What? -A drum for the whole gang. -You're crazy. Come on, let's go. This dude is making himself a drum of Piscola. Imagine if we sold drums of Piscola. I'll buy that anytime. Hey, Fran! There's space here! Fran! What? Shall we meet there? Are we going to the same party? Why me, man? Because nobody knows you. Nobody knows this guy. Vicho, Vicho. Just wait outside the stables. Should I steal the boxes? No, just distract the guard, offer him a drink. -We'll steal the boxes. -OK, got it. -How's everything, my friend? -How are you? -How you doing? -Fine and you? -Very well, I'm Vicente. -Ulises. Nice to meet you. What brings you here? Here I am, looking after the fireworks. So you work here. -I work here. I'm the guard. -I see. -Would you like some Piscola? -No thanks, I quit drinking some time ago. Why? Some time ago it got me really bad, so I quit. -Poisoning? -Yeah, and it was really bad, so... Too bad, the same thing happened to me in Mexico. Really? We went on a study trip to Mexico City. -We went to a bar -Yeah. and we were wasted. I swear to God, we had 12 mezcals each. We ended up totally wasted. After that I never drank that shit again. -That shit is very strong. -Let's go, Vicho. We were looking for you, man. Let's go. -Yeah. Bye, Ulises. Good night. -Bye. Have a nice one. C'mon, get in. C'mon, man. They're taking it in another car. Stupid ass! You're too drunk. Hey, man. What happened? No, cut the crap. Hey, hey! -Vicho, you drive. -They stole the fireworks from me. Your friends stole the fireworks. -What's the matter, man? -They stole the fireworks! Easy, man. What the fuck? You stole the fireworks! -Easy, man. -Stop it. You can't do this! C'mon, get in. Let's get out of here. Hey! You'll kill us, watch out! The fireworks are in the other car. -They put them in another car? -Let me call this dude. Play something, Manu. Play some song. Right! Yeah! That's it! -Shall I keep on straight? -Yeah. Anita Tijoux. Anita Tijoux, man. Careful! Careful, man! Drive safely. -I'm perfectly fine. -Please drive safely. Are you okay, Manuel? -I'm fine, man. -Do you feel well? This verse is awesome. You're fucked up, man. It was full of hot chicks, man. The one at the entrance, she was amazing. Hey, pass me the drum. I gotta focus here. -Stop, stop. -What happened? Damn it, dude. -You're puking, gross! -Let me pull over. Manuel, listen to me. Pull over ahead, there're cars coming. -Damn it. -Man, you're all dirty. Just wait outside until you feel better. I'll drive. -Give me the keys. -Come on, man, you can't drive. -You don't know where it is. -What? This dude can't drive, he's wasted. Manu, you just puked, man. You can't drive. I'm okay, man. You're really drunk, man. -Can you really drive? -Leave me alone. He's a better driver when he's drunk. Okay, let's go. Hey, pass the drum over. Let's go. -Hey, put on some music. -Drive carefully, man. -Yeah, dude. -What a gross shit. It wasn't the first time and it won't be the last. Once we were at the beach and he puked, but the minute after he was making out with a girl. No kidding. -Disgusting, man. -He must have tasted like shit. -How? -Like shit. The girl loved the smell of puke? Gross! Go, go, go, go! -Yeah! -That was so cool! Fireworks by the beach. Yeah, man! It was amazing, dude. Hey, watch out! Oh, motherfucker. -We hit something. -What happened? -Wait, wait. -Let's check. Fuck! -Fuck, man, what did you hit? -Grab your phone. OK. -What happened? -Huh? What is it? Did they go to pee? Fuck, man, what was that shit? Look at that! Oh, shit. Asshole, what is it with you? What are you guys doing? -Fuck this shit. -Why is everyone out of the car? Hey, you, call your dad. Give me the keys, I'll drive. Call him, right now. Now. Call him now! Call your dad. Move, man. -Are you calling him? Call him. -I am! What's the matter? Any answer? -Who are you calling? -Keep on trying, man. We're all going to Manu's house, aren't we? Manu's? No, we're going to Matías' house. -Diego. -I'm gonna call my mom. Diego. -Is he answering? -No, I'm calling mom. -Keep on trying, man. -That's what I'm doing! Are we going to Matías' house or not? You're going to Manu's house, aren't you? -Yes. -Yes? What are you talking about? Let's go to Matías' house. -Shut up, man. -Fuck this guy. Where do you live? -Me? -Leave him here, we're close. -Where do you live? -In Bosque Alto. Let's go to my place and we can get some booze. We're going to Manu's. Why to Manu's? Did she answer? Hello? Hello, mom? Vicho, you get out here! C'mon, man. -You can walk home. -Get out. -You gotta be kidding. -Get out here, man. Fuckin' assholes. MONDAY, MARCH 9 2015 12:47 am What happened? -We need you to come with us. -Huh? Come with us, please. What for? I'll tell you later, please, let's go. But what happened? I'll tell you later. Can you come? We're going to the cops. To the cops? What for? It looks like they fucked up with the fireworks. -No shit. -Yeah. What a drag! They need a statement from us? No, no. We we're going to the cops to see what the problem is. We're going to see the place where we set off the fireworks. It looks like we burned something. What a blunder! Who did it? We did. You did. No way, I didn't do shit. You did. -Isn't it around here? -Up there. Hey, put on some music. Stop it, man. Turn left after that light post. Are you okay, Manuel? -Manuel? -Shut up. Fine. I'm fine. What's wrong? -There they are. -Let's go and talk to them. You wait here. Alright. Do you want me to go with you? No, I'm going with Manuel. Let's go. Wait for us. Officer. -Good evening. -Good evening. What's your problem? We had an accident. -Who was in the car? -The five of us. What happened? -Nothing, man. -What do you mean nothing? Nothing. You know, you were in the car. -What? -You were in the car with us. -So? -So don't play the fool, man. I'm not playing the fool. What did the cops say? We hit something with the car. Why do you think the mirror and the headlight are broken? What did you hit? Cut the shit, you were with us. I'm serious, dumbass, that's why I'm asking! How the fuck didn't you notice such a thing? I was in the back seat with Francisca. Young men! Don't play the fool. Listen, you go with the corporal in the car. Follow him. You, come with me. -With you? -Yeah, you're coming with me. Let's go. You and you, go in the vehicle. Let's check the road. Come with me. All right, young men, move. We have witnesses saying you were driving. No. Manuel was driving. Well, then both will face the judge. But I wasn't driving. There are contradictory versions. Some say you were driving. Who said that? There are witnesses that say you were driving. That's totally false. We'll provide you with a lawyer, in case you don't have one, so you can be questioned by the prosecutor. Wait. Am I arrested? Yes. We are waiting for the judge and he will determine what precautionary measures are appropriate. I don't know what "precautionary measure" means. For the death of Juan Candia Saldía, 32 years old, married, three children. It wasn't me. Easy, I'll ask you that in due time. -I need you to tell me everything. -Okay, where do I start? When you got in Manuel Larrea's car. I got in Manuel Larrea's car and we went to the Equestrian Club. -What time was that? -9:30, 10:00? -9:30, 10:00. -Yes. Who was driving then? -Manuel. -He drove all night? -Yes. -Yes? Yes. OK. -Nothing out of the ordinary happened? -No. What did you do after that? We were at the Equestrian Club, we stole the... I mean, they stole the fireworks, not me... -I'm not saying you did. -Okay. -Where did they find the fireworks? -In a warehouse, close to the horses. -Where did you go after? -To the lookout to set off the fireworks. Who was driving then? Manuel also drove from the Equestrian Club to the lookout. Okay. At the lookout you did nothing. No. At the lookout we set off fireworks. Right, and after that? After that they dropped me off at home. Why did they drop you off at home? Because they were going to another party. So they left you at home and then they went to a party? -Were they going to the party? -I don't know. -They didn't take you to the party. -No. They drop you off. OK. I was in the back seat when they dropped me off. Ana and Francisca can validate that since we were kissing. You were in the back seat kissing Francisca? Yeah, and Ana also, a bit. -A bit. -Yeah. -With Ana, too. -Yeah. Well, a little bit. According to the statements of both of the accused, and in light of the facts of the matter, we are pressing charges against Manuel Larrea and Vicente Maldonado for homicidal drunk driving. A crime that entails a sentence that justifies the request of the prosecution of imprisonment without bail, for as long as this investigation lasts. Anything else, prosecutor? No, your Honor. Defense attorney? Your Honor, I remind you my acting is circumscribed to the defendant Manuel Larrea, but as agreed here with my colleague, the same argument applies to Mr. Vicente Maldonado, as there isn't enough evidence to suppose DUI. Vicho, what happened? They just let us out. But, what happened? I don't know, Francisca woke me up and told me there was an accident, they took me to the cops. And here I am. Did anybody tell you something? I have no idea about what happened. I know as much as you do. They said I should get a lawyer. -Did you call Dad? -Yes. He told me to call Uncle Julio. He must be on his way here. Let's go inside and wait for him? Somebody may tell us something. Why isn't Dad coming? Vicho, he's not a criminal attorney, he's the legal advisor of a mining company. -But he sure knows people. -Yeah, but... Well, if you want, you can call him. Also, Julio is a criminal attorney and will help us. Well, let's go in to find out. First, they have to examine the car for fingerprints. When they get the results, they'll have to change their testimonies or redefine their defense. Do you know who the lawyer is? -I don't. -"The Dog" Barría. The man who was in the hearing? No, that's Andrade, an assistant. Barría is really hard, a tough opponent. Your dad knows Barría well. He can tell you some things. This is classic Barría, creating this smoke screen to create confusion and gives the feeling nothing had happened. Why did they say it was me driving? I don't know, Vicho. If you don't know... Maybe they don't like you. There's no way to prove the accident happened after they dropped off Vicente? That's almost impossible. The most questionable report is the forensic one. Because you cannot determine the exact time of death. Why did they pick Vicente up afterwards? That I don't understand. That's in Barría's hands, you know? Most likely, they called him last night. And he told them to name another person as the driver. I just remember that last night they called Manuel's dad. -Before or after they picked you up? -Before. Before? I mean, we were on the way from the lookout to a party, they dropped me off and right before I got out of the car, Manuel was talking to his dad. Hold on, Vicho. You were in the car with them when they hit this guy? I'm not sure. But that's not what you told the prosecutor. What else didn't you tell him, Vicente? Nothing. He didn't ask me what else. -It's a statement that... -He gave a false statement. That could be bad for Vicente, right? There is no such thing as false statement, especially since he is accused. How could I have lied, if they didn't ask me? You should have told the prosecutor everything. Now they can say anything about you. They are the Larreas. Do you know who the Larreas are? The things they do? Who their friends are? OK. To put you at ease... Why don't you go talk with your friends? -Are they your friends? -Not really. Go talk to them anyway and gather as much information as you can. I'll talk to Barría in case he can tell me something. To put you at ease, okay? MARCEL PROUST IN SEARCH OF LOST TIME: THE GUERMANTES WAY And yet, just as our pity for misfortune is perhaps not very exact So wickedness has probably not in the mind of the wicked man that pure and voluptuous cruelty which it so pains us to imagine. Mati, do you have Manuel Larrea's phone number? Hi. No, man, maybe Oscar has it. OK. Oscar, all good? Hey, do you have Manuel Larrea's phone number? I'm looking him up on Facebook and I can't find him. No, man, why? Nothing. I went to his house, and there's nobody there. I'm calling his cousin and she's not answering either. -What cousin? -Francisca. -The one who speaks weird, like Yankee? -That one. -You fucked her, bro? -No, I need it for something else. You did! Perv! What are you up to? Nothing, I'm bored, and you? Trying to contact some people but they don't answer For a party or something? No, for something that happened. No big deal, wanna hang out? Cool, but you'll have to pick me up. Where? Papudo. OK. No problem. Hi. How are you? -Fine and you? -Fine, too. Was it too hard to get here? I got lost at a curve up there, but it's okay. There are so many curves in these streets. Yeah, so unnecessary. Where are we going? I don't know. What do you feel like doing? -Let's have a drink. -Why not? Sure. -Do you know any bars around? -Yes. Go straight. We can go to a bar or we can stop by and get some drinks. How about that? Cool, and we could go to a lookout. Okay. -That's cool, right? -Yeah. Come here. Wow. -Wow, what? -Nothing. Touch me. Deal breaker, checking your cell phone. A friend sent me a video. A video called "Fifi", have you heard about it? Yeah. -Have you seen it? -No. Have you? I've heard it's hardcore. -It's starting. -And they are, like, 13 years old. They look like little kids! Shit. One at a time, one at a time. -Is she Fifi? -I don't know, there are two girls. Two girls. Seems like. It's kind of dull, hold on. We were dating for three weeks and then it was over. Things got boring. -Humdrum? -I got tired, and he was complicated. -He is complicated. -Right? Yes, I notice. He had a crush on me and then got angry because I was dating other guys. -Really? -Yeah, he exaggerates a lot. -He is jealous. -He is possessive. We had nothing and the guy got angry. -I didn't know he was like that. -He is. Please don't tell him anything. -Do we have some shit left? -Do you want? Just ashes. No, there is something. It is soft. -Fuck. -Here. She stifled me. What a drag. How long did you last? Like a year. A lot. How did you stand it? I just fell in love. I mean, we were connected by something else. What school did you go to? -Verbo Divino. -Oh, I see. There you have it. Now I get you. I got your whole picture. What? Tell me, what? You can be with someone for a year without having good sex. I mean, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't too reciprocal, you know? Like, I was the one leading all the time and I thought I was the bad one. -You, the bad one? -I thought so. How cute, sometimes you touch me. Oh, shit. When a person touches you, do you throw their cell phone? Sometimes. -We watched it all. -Look at them. Fuck. -What's that part of the body? -I don't know. Looks like a lizard. Vicho, we have to meet the prosecutor in his office at 9:00 am tomorrow Okay Your alcohol test came back negative. Which shows you didn't drink or you stopped drinking long before the test or, like I just said, you didn't drink at all, but that contradicts testimonies that say they saw you drinking. Or maybe your liver works wonders and absorbs alcohol quickly. Or all the above. Anyway, that's good for you. Now, the bad news. The other four occupants of the vehicle came back positive for alcohol. Figures aren't too high, but... with the new law, it's enough to prosecute Manuel for DUI resulting in death. That's almost a sure thing. I wouldn't be so sure. Why? No... Because there's other bad news. The police report on the fingerprints came back positive. But, that can't be possible. Yes. Vicente's fingerprints were clearly found on the steering wheel, on the gear lever and on the handle. That means Vicente did drive that car. Wait, is that evidence conclusive? Quite conclusive. According to the police, there's no doubt. That is not all. We also have witnesses that say Vicente drove that car. -I drove it in a... -Let me speak, Vicho. -There are several witnesses. -Who would those witnesses be? Several people saw you at the party drinking from a drum, helping with the robbery of the fireworks. That's a lie. Vicho, let's listen to the prosecutor, please. They saw you driving Manuel's car when you left the club. -That's true, but that was only for... -Vicho! Also, regarding the time of the accident, a witness says it wasn't at 5:00 a.m. but around 1:00 a.m. Who's that witness? A cousin of the deceased. According to him their car broke down, his cousin left walking while he stayed fixing the car, and once the car was running he left and never saw his cousin again. There are several witnesses. -Several. -Can I have one? -Do you have a lighter? -Yeah. What a mess. A bad thing indeed. -And Barría is such a tough guy. -You're telling me! I can't find out you were driving because the DA tells me, Vicho! I only drove a little bit. I took the wheel because he was wasted. Look, Vicho. A lot of people saw you, and they also saw you drinking wine from a drum. -It was Piscola. -Even better, Piscola. And from where to where did you drive? From the Equestrian Club to the lookout, but not the whole way, because on the way, Manuel wanted to drive and he took the wheel. -Was he wasted? -Totally, we had to stop for him to puke. Wait, you stopped. Did somebody see you there? At that place, I don't think there were witnesses. OK. Wait. Let me think. Hold on. The thing is... The place you said you stopped at 12:30 is the same place you said the accident happened. At 5, after they dropped you off. It's in the same direction, but I don't know if it was exactly the same place. Damn, Vicho. Do you realize they can say it was you? But it wasn't me. Damn. I hope so, since you were so wasted. And now I won't be able to use your first statement. -Why? -Because it's detrimental to us, they'll think you said it to avoid any responsibility. You fucked it up! I didn't do it to avoid responsibility, I said it because... I said I didn't drive because I forgot, not because I was hiding something. You said so, I was drunk. Why should I lie? Listen, Vicho. Get this well into your head. The truth is what you can prove. Period. The truth is not "the truth." What are you up to? I miss you What are you up to? Want to go out? You'll wet the pillow and then you'll go get mine, that is dry. It wasn't me, Mom. I believe you, son. We all do. Fuck, why do I have such a bad luck! That's true. But you're not a bad person. You just make bad decisions. Sometimes you choose wrong. Mom, please don't preach at me. I'm not, I'm just saying. Sometimes you have to say no, Vicente. I know at your age it's hard to understand but we must learn how to say no. You don't have to go to all parties and drink all the drinks. You have to leave some for later. Damn, I didn't even want to stay in Chile. High school was hell, college is full of jerks. Vicente, this is not the time to have this conversation. We're talking about something else here. Got it. Okay, do you want me to bring my dry pillow? Remember? You'd come every night to my bed to take my pillow away because yours was wet. You'd go into bed like a caterpillar. You almost roasted. 'Cause you wouldn't let me turn on the air conditioner. Thanks to that, you caught much fewer colds than your schoolmates. It was so hot. Maybe I cover you too much, that's true. What is the sentence for manslaughter? It's 540 days. How much is that? A year and a half. But since it's Vicho's first offense, he'll be out on parole. We can also try to strike a deal with the prosecution, but the conditions would be up to them to decide. What does that mean? If they want, they can ask for money for the victim's family. Suspend the kid's driving license for two years. He can't commit any crime. And if we don't like the deal? Bad. We'd have to go on a trial and face the sentence for manslaughter and his records would be stained forever. What time is it? It's 21:15. Turn on the TV. I want to see if they say something about this. It was delicious. Not eating so well since Magaly and I separated. Yup, come for a bit if you want Excuse me. -More wine? -Yes. Thank you. -Do you have condoms? -No. Okay, do it. Fuck me! -Don't come inside, okay? -No. C'mon, daddy. Vicente. Don't come inside of me, okay? -Did you come? -I did. You're kidding me. I'm sorry. You turned me on so much. Get out. -What's wrong with you? -What? I told you not to. -I forgot. -What do you mean you forgot? -I was too horny. -You forgot after less than a minute. I'm really sorry. Fuck! Get out! These are our fries! I'm kidding. Don't do that, he'll get diarrhea, and the date will become very unsexy. It is already unsexy. Dude, Fran's girlfriend is at Tomi's house Come introduce us tell her I'm a lesbian guy. Want more? Hey, dawg! -How are you? -Good, and you? Hey, Anita. I heard you've been saying things. -What things? -What do you mean what things? Why haven't you answered my calls these last days? You are part of their plan. I don't wanna talk about that shit. You're drunk, please go! So you don't wanna talk about that shit? But I do. You know why you don't wanna talk about that shit? Because you're not the one who'll go to jail. But I am. No one will go to jail. -What? Do you guarantee that? -Vicente, Vicente. Sofía, what are you doing here? How are you? How you want me to be? I'm fucked up. What a mess. Your cousins are shit. They're framing me for something I didn't do. No one's saying that. What do you mean no one's saying that? After the accident it's all they've said. Well, I do believe you, anyway. -You do? -Yeah. You're not a bad guy. Kind of naïve, you screw up, but you're good. Naïve how? Naïve. You screw up, like what you did with me. -How you doing, bro? -Fine and you? Really well. Dawg, as a friend, can you beat it? This is my house and my party so please, beat it. Can you at least give me a reason? Many people here don't want to see you. You know well what you did. What, man? What? Did you tell this guy what I did? -C'mon. -Everyone's against me now, man. Dude, your party's shit. I'm going. -I don't give a fuck. Bye. -Go. I'll be glad to. Vicente! Vicho! Vicho! Wake up. Vicente. Vicente. Vicho. They're looking for you. -Tell me how it goes -Okay -Vicente, how are you? -Fine and you? I'm good. Nice house. I brought something for you to see. Wait, my uncle said he would speak with you. Yes, he would, but we agreed I would come and speak with you. It's simpler, spare ourselves problems. Well, look, this is the car, right? I brought it for you to see it. I wanna show you some things. If you look well, it's a minor damage. Mainly the mirror. Right? What I think is the man ran and hit himself against the concrete. He crashed. He died. We all know. Also, the autopsy revealed there aren't big injuries made with the front or with the sides, therefore, he had been in the clinic, I don't know, two weeks. Broken ribs. But the man ran. He fell into the ditch. Hits the rock. Dies. Therefore, if he didn't die from this, it is possible that you hadn't noticed. -Are you following? -Yeah, what about that? So it is possible you hit him and you didn't notice. You hit him and they didn't notice. -How? -Listen. Manuel told me he was vomiting on the way and that you were singing. He said he suddenly opened the door to vomit and that he felt a buckling. So, I think maybe you hit the man but you don't remember. -I gotta go. -Buddy, it's very simple. If the car had hit the man, this would be more bashed, wouldn't it? But that didn't happen. Think about it. It's possible that you... -Right, I understood that I can be guilty. -I don't know if you understand well. We can also say you hit him and don't remember. This is very common. Buddy, it is the third time you tell me. Can we talk later? See you. Bye. Badly I'll talk to him tomorrow Give Julio the witnesses And tell him we're sticking with the breathalyzer test So, what about it? If I did it, it must have been somewhere between the Equestrian Club and 3.2 kilometers away, because that's where Manuel vomited. Did you find the vomit? No, I found something that looked like vomit, but I'm not sure. Do you have any witnesses that say you were listening to that song? Those in the car. Did you talk to them? I've been trying to lately, but they've been ignoring me and not answering my calls. I can't do more. Great, they ignore you, that's perfect! Don't be so hard on him. I'm not hard on him, Roxana. I'm not. The thing is that's no evidence. He doesn't get that. It's the truth. It's a truth that will take you straight to jail. But how can that happen if I wasn't driving? Look, you're old enough to understand that it's better to take Larrea's offer. If we decide to go against them, they will hire the best lawyer to represent the victim's family and the first thing he'll do is to question the alcohol test. They'll say it was made too late and that is not valid. They'll also say you were carrying a drum of Piscola, which is true, right? And on top of that, they'll have your testimony. Your testimony! -Are you listening to me? -Yeah. Your own testimony that you drove to the place of the accident. Can't you see you're going to jail? But it wasn't me! How long will this go on? Okay, it wasn't him. This guy is innocent. Problem solved. He's innocent! -Julio, please. -Go to the DA, tell him you're innocent. He might believe you and problem solved! -Stop it. -No, no. Go, man. He might believe you and you both can go to the beach holding hands and singing the fuckin' song. I will go. But you're going alone. I'm going to the bathroom. It doesn't make any sense to say I was driving when it wasn't me! I wasn't drunk, my alcohol test was negative. What? They can forbid me to leave the country or other things that I don't deserve. What lesson? I drove just to help this asshole. That's so unfair. Most people do it all the time and the only time I do it, everything goes wrong. No, we don't learn from bad luck, we learn from a dad telling his son what he should do. I can't just accept bad luck and go on for things I didn't... Hey, what's up with those messages you sent? I don't know, Vicente, okay but still strange, don't you think? Are you okay? Are you? Yeah. Anyway, this shit's kinda boring. What? Why? I don't know, everything's kind of boring, you, me, everything. -Why? -What? Why, because it took me too long to come? Well, yeah. Actually, it's everything. But, relax, it's nothing serious. Don't look at me like that. But it's not nice of you to tell me that. But, it's the truth. What can I say? -No, it's okay, but... -Lie to you? No, no. Clean yourself. Here. But we can give it another try, can't we? No, Vicente. -What? -But it's cool. It was great knowing you, we had fun. But is this a goodbye or what? -Huh? -A little. But don't worry. Why do you get so weird? I just worry 'cause... was it that bad? No, it wasn't that bad. I don't know, it's just not fun anymore. It is what it is. If you say so. Shall we go? I'm a little tired. I have to get up very early. -Do you want me to take you home? -Please. Can you? Let's go. -Hey, how are you? -Fine, fine. -All good? -Yeah, thanks. -You're Vicente Maldonado. -Yeah. Son of "The Camel" Maldonado. -Luis Maldonado Lara. -Yeah. You look just like your dad. We studied law together, at Universidad de Chile. We took the Bar together. We were good friends. We had different interests. I always liked criminal law and he liked commercial law. Oh, well. Law is a career that soon shows you if you have fingers for the piano. Your father had fingers for the piano, no doubt. What Camel didn't have were feet for the piano. -You get it? -Not really. Look, the piano is played with your fingers, right? You must have agile, fine, sensitive and delicate fingers. But it's also played with the feet. Have you noticed the piano has three pedals? A good player uses the feet. Nobody teaches you that. You must learn it by yourself. The good music is kind of "colored" with the pedals. If a note stays in the air or is cut in a staccato way. You need to know that. That's not in the books and nobody teaches you that. It's like criminal law, nobody teaches you the nuances. You need to know how to use the pedals of the law, the gray areas of the law. Excuse me, who are you? Oh, sorry, let me introduce myself. I'm Gustavo Barría. Manuel Larrea's lawyer. -How are you? -Good. But first and foremost I'm a friend of your dad, that's why I'm here. -How about a beer? -No, I'm okay. I love drinking at the beach, defying the authorities. Everything is forbidden on these fuckin' beaches. And some people like it here. They buy those houses for millions of dollars. They could buy the same house in the Caribbean. But people like it. I don't know why. So does your mother. -She has a house here, doesn't she? -Yeah. I don't know what will happen with the house. I think it'll go down, the Larreas will force her to sell. She is bound to lose money. I've worked for them for a long time, like 20 years. They're good people, but they have the power of money. I take care of all their business, the farming and mining business, their investment funds, everything. I've filled my pockets with them. But it's a 24/7 job, you gotta be ready for anything, like a firefighter. I could be home right now, scratching my balls, but I'm here, speaking about the time your dad and me fought against Pinochet's Secret Police. He must have told you stories, right? -Stories of those times. -Not much. There was this case... I don't remember if your dad was involved or not. It was 1989, right at the end of the Pinochet Regime. I think... anyway, my sister was a teacher in the Faculty of Agriculture at the Universidad de Chile. We all graduated from the same university. She called me after a colleague of hers was arrested. In those days the Secret Police arrested people for a minor offense. Then they moved you to a different location. And that's when they took people and made them disappear. This guy was "requested" by the police and was about to be transferred. He was ready to be executed, vanished. The only way to help him was to speak with a friend who was in the narcotics brigade, a captain. My idea was to accuse him of trafficking and arrest him under the jurisdiction of my friend. But he didn't take the deal. I tried to convince him, to explain the situation. He said he had nothing to do with drug trafficking, that he was a union leader. Stupid, dumb. I wasted 45 minutes trying to convince him. Finally, the agents took him away. He was never heard of again. What are you trying to tell me with all this? Nothing, man, nothing. This is only a friendly conversation on the beach. So you can learn how to use the pedals on the piano. And realize that sometimes what's important is hidden. That's why I told you the story of the secret police. This guy was fighting a fight that was bound to lose from the beginning. Many battles we think we are losing we can sometimes win after all. I tell you this in case you want to fight a losing battle. Fighting against Larrea's money is not easy. We can help you much more than you can help yourself. I don't understand. There's nothing to understand. This moment calls for for action. It's better not to think. That will only spoil the moment. You really look like your father. The Camel, what a funny guy. I brought the newspaper. Read it. And have some beer, if you want. Are you taking the cooler? Keep that shit. I paid a penny for it. I bought it just to bring the beer to this shitty beach. The sooner I get out of here, the better. Well, bye. SENATOR LARREA'S CAR INVOLVED IN FATAL ACCIDENT PROSECUTION INVESTIGATES A FRIEND OF THE FAMILY I remember when we were getting to Fundo el Solar, there was a car DEFENSE WITNESS MARCO LUIS ANDRADE DE SOTO parked at the roadside, a black Daewoo, or maybe it was gray. All I know is it was dark. And... Some 100 yards ahead, maybe more, I think, There was a guy walking in the middle of the road. So we had to slow down, otherwise we would have hit him. DEFENSE WITNESS JUAN CARLOS LIRA VALDERRAMA We asked him if he was okay. And he sent us to hell. He told us, "Go fuck yourselves," so we took off. It was like 5:00, 5:30 a.m., PROSECUTION WITNESS VÍCTOR ANDRÉS NORAMBUENA CANDÍA I was there with the hood opened waiting for it to cool down, while Nelson was walking away. I asked him to wait for me but he played tough guy. He was wasted, and just left. VICTIM'S COUSIN FIRST STATEMENT Some minutes later a truck came, purple or red, and stopped a few yards away. I thought it had stopped to help us because two people got out of the car, maybe to pee... I don't remember well. I don't know. It was still dark. Until they got in the car and drove away. I didn't pay too much attention to it, I was worried about my own problem. So when the car was okay, I drove away. That was the last time I saw Nelson. The day after they called me to tell me that they had found him dead, killed. At parties, we always choose a designated driver. We spin a bottle, and choose the one who won't drink. DEFENSE WITNESS ANA LUISA LONGONI JARA In return, we put him in charge of handling the booze. So, that night, or afternoon, after the beach we put Vicente to play. Actually, since he was the new guy, we made him the designated driver. That's why he had the Piscola drum because he was the one choosing who would or wouldn't drink. That night, we had chosen Vicente as the designated driver. DEFENSE WITNESS MANUEL AUGUSTO VICTORINO LARREA GARAIZABAL After partying at my place, we went to the Equestrian Club and we stole the fireworks, and later we set them off at a waste land near Zapallar. After that, we went home to sleep. It was late, or early in fact, like 5:00 a.m., DEFENSE WITNESS FRANCISCA ANTONIA SARRATEA GARAIZABAL and Vicente woke me up so I would go with him to his house. He also woke Diego up. So we got up, I wasn't feeling well. I had a hangover, even though I had slept. So we got into the car. I was in the back seat with Ana and Diego. Vicho was driving, since he was the only one sober enough. DEFENSE WITNESS DIEGO ANDRES CARRASCO LANCOIS On the way we felt a bump, like we had hit something. And suddenly, at a curve, I can't recall exactly where, from behind a lamppost CHARGED WITH NEGLIGENT HOMICIDE VICENTE ANTONIO MALDONADO ROSS came a black thing. I immediately tried to avoid it, but I felt a bump. So we stopped. I parked the car and we got out and looked around. We saw nothing. We turned our cell phones' flashlights on and looked around and still, we didn't find anything. We looked for around 20 minutes. Then I realized the only thing broken was the car's right side mirror. Diego told me it must have been a lamppost. He was trying to calm me down, I was very nervous at that point. So I told him the best we could do was to go the police. We got in the car and I drove to the police station. We parked and then I got scared because I didn't really know what to say, and I got very confused and forgot everything. So, finally Diego and Manuel went to talk to the police. And that's when I moved to the back seat. Hey! Get him! Come on! Come on, Nacho, there's a space! Go, motherfucker! -Shit! -What? Is pushing allowed now? C'mon! He's a faggot! Get him! That's it! FOUR MONTHS AFTER THE ACCIDENT -Hello, Vicho. How are you? -Fine and you? Fine. You got a letter. -From whom? -I don't know. It's in the dining room. Okay. Will you have lunch now or wait for your mom? -Is Mom coming? -Yeah, she called saying she'd come. -All right, I'll wait for her. -Any laundry? Yeah, in my bag. -Thanks, Elcira. -No wories. They offered me 750 million pesos, so I'm selling it. You made some profit, anyway. With that money, I'll pay the Candia family. I didn't have 50 million. Selling wasn't the idea, but, well... I'd like to go to Pingueral, to the south. To be closer to your grandmother. We can fly to Concepción and take her car. There are very good houses there, for half the price. It's not the same, but, well... At least for some time. I got a letter from the court for the sentence reading. -Is it set for the 20th? -Yeah. I won't be able to make it. Would you mind going alone with Uncle Julio? No. Drive a lot these last days, because after that, no driving for four years. Uncle Julio said we could come to an agreement and make it just two. Two years, four years, it's the same at your age. But don't get too wasted. That's not sexy. -It's not? -No. -Why not? -Just a little, to... A little to get tipsy, but wasted and playing the fool, no way. Just a little liquid luck. You're Irish, so you know. I think it's okay. Definitely okay. It's okay. Definitely okay. What are you talking about? How many have you had? -A couple. -Just a couple. -A couple. -Just a couple? -You want more? -We just started. No, I never mix drinks. They don't do me any good. You liar. No one believes that. -How are you, Manuel? -Fine, and you? -Fine. -That's good. I'm almost running out of tobacco. I'll have to roll another one. It doesn't look like you're smoking tobacco. It's only tobacco. Can I have some? You really want? -Vicho? -What? Let's go. They all left already. I'll go get my jacket. Hurry up, we are all waiting. -Easy, bro. -Sorry.
