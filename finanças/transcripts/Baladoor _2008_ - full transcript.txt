My dress is superb. - Mine is also superb. You look great in these dresses. Who draped these dhotis? - Elder grandpa, grandpa. You too look superb. Wait! I draped it on our wedding and I am wearing it now. Uncle. - Yes. What's this, uncle! Do we need to dress up for Lord Satyannaraya vow? Don't talk like that. God will turn you blind. Nicely said, father-in-law. - That's how it's done. You are looking good in this. Greetings, madam. Welcome. - Greetings. - Sit down. Please sit down. Kalyani, where's your husband? Here, Uncle. He's coming. Why are you so late?? - What's this, uncle! Englishmen invented pants because... ...it's too hard to put on a dhoti. Shut up! They say he who wears dhoti is a Telugu man. Wear it. Sister-in-law, where is brother? - There he is. Mr. Rama Krishna, you sit here. Madam, you sit next to him. - You carry on with it. I will come back. - You sit there, sister-in-law. I can take care of this. Sit down. He's always like that. In business he doesn't let me do anything. And at home he doesn't let you do anything. And yes, where is Chanti? Did you send him somewhere? No one needs to send him anywhere. He is wandering outside all the time. Why do you scold him, uncle? Younger brother went to call the videographer. Stop. Stop. This house. Brother is here. It's not your brother, it's an idiot. How much? - Chalis (forty). - This much! It's too less, sir. - It's less? Chalis means seventy, right? Challis means forty rupees. - Forty rupees? Why didn't you tell me before he left? I lost 30 rupees. - It's your money. It's yours. You dropped your purse in auto. Madam. Madam. Wife should sit on the left side of her husband. Why so? - Because men keep their wallets in their left pockets. ldiot. Heart is the most important organ of our body. And it's on left side. That's why a wife should... ...sit at her husband's left side like his heart. I see. What are you staring at! Cover everything. First cover the vow and then cover the priest. Cover the uncles and then cover the aunties. Cover everyone. - Hey, first you stop covering the camera. You brought the cameraman? Where has this idiot gone? Someone was to be admitted in the hospital. So he went there to help them reach it. Who are they? - I don't know. He doesn't tire praising his you. He says that we should... ...be helping others like his uncle does. No, don't beat me. I beg you. Please. Come here. Take it. Set him on fire. - No. If she doesn't confess to you... ...you'll set her on fire? You think if you pour acid on them or stab them... ...girls will fall for you? Set him on fire. - No, don't do that. When it came to you, you are asking for mercy? If you ever repeat such a thing again... Forgive me, brother. I beg you. - Apologize there. Apologize. Forgive me. - Go. Go. Thanks a lot, Chanti. Thank me later. First, take her home. I have to go to class. Class? Who will give you a class? - My father. What is that? - Lord's holy offering. That won't be enough for you. Distribute it among everyone. Don't laugh so much! Or I'll apply a 100% discount on your bill. - Padmavati. - Yes? Where is Purushottam? We need to give offerings to the priest. Your brother won't let you do that either. Look there. You performed the vow really well, priest. How did you come in, uncle? - By climbing the pipe. If you want to come up in life, you have to climb pipes. Practice it from now onwards... ...and it will be useful when you grow up. One scoundrel a home is enough. Don't make them like yourself. Here is the Amitabh Bachchan of this home. Hey, stop there. - Leave it, uncle. Grandpa would scold you and you'd hang your head in shame. It's an everyday occurrence, uncle. Aren't you ashamed? You fight even on the day of the vow? Can't you sleep well if you don't beat someone? You won't change. If that's what you think, I'll depend on you... ...and stay idly at home. Aren't you doing that already? You wake up in the morning and get into fights... ...and then paint the town red. - What? You would never listen to your father. Can't you be happy unless he scolds you? What's your age and what do you think you are doing? I talked like that because your father was here. You're not hurt, right? - No matter how much he scolds me, it won't hurt. But if you scold me even a little... It hurts a lot, uncle. Just a bit. A bit more. A bit more.

Uncle, matching is superb. You select my dresses from tomorrow onwards. Greetings. - Greetings, Mr. Nani. Pappu. - Brother. - Did anyone come here? Yes. - Who came? I came. - You are cracking jokes? I'll break your head. I'm not asking about you. Did anyone else come? Yes. - Who come? - You came. What? What? - Brother. I am not talking about you and l. I am asking if anyone else came here. They are coming. I didn't ask you about good for nothing fellows. Did anyone useful for us come here? Nani, you are talking too much. I will hit you and you will... Order two teas. - You don't want Boost? Hey, two cups of Boost! - Hey, stop it! I was kidding. Nani, don't mess with it without knowing about it. It's the silencer. You have to fix a new one. Hello! I know my job well. When I started out here you weren't even in your nappies. You don't wear underwear even now. Hey, Nani, is the car ready? - ls the cash ready? I have the cash. - OK. Hey, the party's here. Already this shed got a bad rap... ...due to your presence. I talk, quarrel and fight... ...with my customers. You don't get into it. Look, you can't cross this line. You got it? Get out of here. Hey, bring a chair for sir. - No, thanks. I need to go fast. There's a settlement case pending. - One minute, bro. Hey, bring a coconut. - But I don't drink coconut water. I am not offering you coconut water to drink, brother. To ward off the evil eye. - I don't have such superstitions. But I have, brother. I never deliver a car... ...without warding off the evil eye from the car, brother. I am getting late. I need to go fast. If we don't ward off the evil eye, you time might be up, brother. Listen to me. - OK, carry on. Hey, bring the coconut. - Here it is, brother. Hey, you! I was rushing to go to the settlement case... ...and you broke my car's glass with your sentiment? Hey, you! I will kill you. I will kill you. Hey, if you don't repair my car within an hour... ...and deliver it to my home, I am going to kill you. Hey! He beat me up... ...and you didn't come to stop him? You told us not to cross the line. We've obeyed. That is what is called friendship. - Yes. You scoundrels! Hey, Pappu! - Bring some bandages. 22 acres of land near Samshabad airport... ...are being auctioned. The starting price is 50 crores. 55 crores. - Rasi Builders, 55 crores. 60 crores. - Vandana Builders, 60 crores. 65 crores. - 100 crores. He's here. It's a disaster now. He raised it to 100 crores at once. What's there to say now? He came here only to raise the price, brother. Shall we stop, sir? - Keep rising our quotation... ...till I stop you. - 100,00,00,001 rupees. It's not an auction anymore. It's a battle. 110 crores. - Umapati Builders, 110 crores. 110,00,00,001 rupees. - Buying that land... ...at this price is of no use. It's already too high. Let's drop it here. 120 crores. - Umapati Builders... He doesn't listen to anyone other than his wife. 120,00,00,001 rupees. - He is a crazy man to raise it... ...but what happened to these R.K. guys. They are raising it like anything. - 150 crores. He's in trouble. - Umapati Builders, 150 crores. It goes once. Umapati Builders, 150 crores. It goes twice. - 150,00,00,001 rupees. R. K. Builders, It goes thrice. With this, that Rama Krishna lost 50 crores. Even if I didn't gain anything, my enemy lost a lot. I am very happy now. Hello! - It's me, Murthy. The land is yours, right? The matter leaked from CM's office just now. The government is about to build an lT-park near that land. The papers have been signed as well in the secretariat. That land's value is more than 200 crores now. Sir, I told you about it as soon as the papers were signed. After a woman delivers the baby, even a ward boy can tell if it's a boy or a girl. I need a doctor who could scan... ...and tell me the gender when the baby is in the womb. He might die, sir. You are getting so upset... ...for losing just one tender? - It's not a newborn anger. It's 20 year old anger. Still, I can't forget how Rama Krishna insulted me. I didn't take the water-tank contract... ...being the president of this village and give it to you... ...and you in return to have exploited a poor laborer... ...who came to work for a living? I made a mistake in haste. Forgive me. For misbehaving with a female laborer, I touched Rama Krishna's feet and begged for forgiveness. But he instead of forgiving me, he got me beaten up... ...by everyone in the middle of the village... ...and expelled me from the village. I will make him pay for every blow on my body. That's why I won't be hurt, even if I lose 100 crores. But even if that Rama Krishna gains one single rupee, I can't bear it. This is the only thing your brother-in-law does perfectly. If he could hear us, the hammer would turn this side. I decided to sacrifice a goat for the new building. It's done. Shailu. - Yes, coming, mother. Has sister fallen in love? She didn't tell me such an important thing? If she hadn't told me about it how can she tell our parents! I will have to talk to uncle and convince him. She's my only sister. Chanti, you are such a responsible guy. Uncle. You like him? - Sorry for the interruption. You don't get tensed after hearing what I say. - What? Love is like a rose. It gives fragrance if we grow it... ...and it hurts us if we try to cut it. Love is a feeling. It's born only one. And it is there with us till our death. We shouldn't separate those in love. Cut the crap. You are in love? It's not me, brother. - Then who? Our Shailu. What are you saying? - Yes, uncle. Shailu loves a guy. Did she tell you? - Anyone would know it on telling. A true brother will know before being told. You want proof? He looks like a king, right? Without building the barriers of wealth, caste and religion... ...get them married and save your reputation. Why is everyone looking at me that way? Instead of staring at you, you want us to felicitate you? He's the guy we've selected for Shailu. You got us all tensed for no reason. Tomorrow we are going to our village for the Shankranti. We are thinking of fixing a date for the wedding after we return. You heard that, didn't you? The train is at 4 O' clock tomorrow. Don't go anywhere. Stay at home. I overacted without knowing the matter. You idiot. Hey, you used to ride a bulldozer earlier? Won't your auto go faster? Driver faster. What's the matter? Are we going to Rajamundry by auto? Shut up! We missed the train while you were covering that ugly face with make-up. Otherwise we would've gone with them. Oh really! If we had gone with them we would've looked like rogues. Only by being late, we can maintain some level. Hey! I bought that with my uncle's money. We bought this as well with his money. - Wine? It's not about the wine. It's about having what we need when we need it! That's what's important. Listen, for others it's water, but for us it's a quarter. Listen, we might travel on train without a ticket... But without liquor, I can't travel anywhere. We might miss the train. Get down. Get down. Here's the money. - Hey, drunkard, be quick. I'm coming. Which platform for the Godavari Express? Five. - It's five. Come fast. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Come fast. Come fast. - Stop. I can't run. I am sorry. Come on! There's no need to touch my feet. You already said sorry. She bent to take her ticket. You are expecting too much. You think so? - You don't think so? The girl's beautiful. You won't think so. - Shut up! I am sorry. I was getting late for the Godavari... In the rush, I didn't see you. We are also taking the Godavari. Did you see this? You and we are getting into the same train. We would also get down from the train. It's on platform no. 5. Come. No, the Godavari is on platform no. 3. Who's the fool who told you that? - The guy at the counter... The TTE told us. - But... Alright. You may go then. Get down happily at Kolkata or in Kashmir. Srinu, the train's moving. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come on. - Come fast. Hey, wait. I will get in first. Be careful. Be careful. Be careful. Thanks a lot. If you hadn't bumped into me... ...I would've missed the train. - I didn't do it intentionally. - It's alright. It wasn't intentional ...but it helped me. They're some elephants on our seats. We will kick them out. Come in. Come in. We were just two minutes late and you took our seats? - You didn't know about us? - Or did you do it intentionally? - Get up! No, no. These are our seats. We have reservations. Check these. Hey, they took the Godavari Express to go to Mumbai. They have huge bodies, but there is nothing in their brain. We were late, but got into the right train. Were you sleeping while getting in? Get up. No, brother. - No, brother? What's your problem? They are getting up. Get up. Get up. Hey, before the TTE comes, get down at next station. Otherwise he will give you a fine. ldiots. Foolish fatsos. If you weren't there I would've also gotten into the wrong train. Actually... - You were lucky I bumped into you, is that it? Basically I have a great helping nature. That's a bit too much. - You take as much as you want. Ticket. Ticket. Mr. TTE! These fatsos got in this train by mistake. Leave them. Just for the sake of humanity. - Where is your ticket? Show them. - Here it is. You took the Mumbai Express with a Godavari Express' ticket? The TTE also got into the wrong train. I'm not in the wrong train. You are. What are you saying, sir! - This is a Mumbai-train, girl. Sir, please check it again. A TTE like you told us the Godavari's on platform no. 5. Who is that? - 998. Sir, sir, sir, it's him. It's him. - 1000. Him? He became mad after losing his job. He just gets on and off trains. I told them the Godavari was on platform no. 3. They scared me and brought me here. Yeah! You're such a hot chick. We planned on selling you in Mumbai. You can fight later. First pay the fine. - Pay the fine! - I won't. Then you can go spend six months in jail. Jail? I never went to jail! - We live there! We come out once in a while! How much is the fine? - 3,000 rupees in total. I only have 3,000 rupees. We will get down at the next station. Will you refund us 2,000 rupees? That's what it costs to get down at the next station. If you want to go further, I will come again. Take it. - You are a kind man, sir. You carry on, sir. We will get down. He's holding my T-shirt. Are you scared of their size? If they touch me, I'll kick them out. Oh God! You are alive because you are running away... - Otherwise, you'll be dead. - Get up. Get up. Get up. Among so many people I had to bump into you! What bad luck! You bumped into me and took the wrong train. Had it been someone else, he would've taken you somewhere else... and done that! I know what to do in such a case. Yes, you are Bruce Lee. - You want to see? Stop, Miss! No need to show him your manliness. Hey, I'll go find out when is the next train. - Till I return, keep some distance. - OK. Why are you telling him? I'll keep my distance. I am allergic to even his breathe. Oh! - Get lost. Hold your breath for a while, it will go. - Hiccups? Your life. The world will be a better place. Hey, you! Hey, you! - Me? - Yes, you. When there's a scoundrel like you right here... ...do you think I could be calling someone else in that way? Am I crazy? Really? It's working. - What's working? What did you say a while ago? - What did I say? That you would take me to Mumbai and sell me there? Who do you think I am? - Bhanumati from Turredu. When I was just 13 years old l... Just like that. Everyone in my village looked at me in that way. I gave them a hard time. I will give you as well a hard time. I will sell you in the market... ...and I will buy a ribbon, a ribbon. Till now she looked like a city-girl... ...but the liquor brought out her true self. Water. - I won't give you. Give me! - I won't. Give me. You won't give me? - I won't. You won't give me? - I will never give you. This scoundrel is not giving water to a poor girl. When I was just 13 years old l... He is not giving me water... ...even though when I was just 13 years old l... Brothers and sisters! Ladies and gentlemen! - Oh God! Wait. Wait. Wait. Take the water. Get down. Get down. Take it. Take it. Drink it and die. Oh God! Bhanumati. Knife. I need to have a drink or else I won't... Hey! ls this how you keep\your distance? I left less than two minutes ago... ...and she already fell for you? - You will fall if I tell you. Don't worry. Tell me. - She drank your liquor. Oh God! Had I known, I would've bought half a bottle. She had hiccups and thought it was water. Tell me when the train is coming. What train? We are on the wrong route. About two kilometers from here, we will get buses. How do we handle her now? I will carry the luggage like a donkey... ...and you carry her like an idiot. - Rascal! Ticket. Ticket. Hey, he's asking us to take a ticket. - Buy one. If I bring money when I am with you... ...you'll feel insulted, so I didn't bring any. I gave all my money to the TTE. Then check her handbag. I've already did a long time ago. Apart from pins, rubber-bands and stickers, there's nothing. Hey, who said women have become modern? Their clothes might have changed... ...but their hiding place for money hasn't. Look there. But how? - With your hand. You need my help for this? Take it out. - Isn't it wrong? - It's not my problem. I will tore my clothes and beg my way through Rajamundry. Meanwhile you will have to put her on your shoulder and... Hey, don't scare me. I will try. Hey, it's very difficult. - What? Putting your hand inside. or taking it out? - Ticket, ticket. I got it. - Then take it out. Okay. Ticket, ticket. Three tickets to Rajamundry. - Ticket, ticket. What are you doing? I'm keeping it back. - Stop. I'll buy half a bottle if we find a wine shop on the way. Rascal, a quarter with your money... ...but a half with someone else's? Shut up! I just need a quarter. But if she gets up, she'll start yelling. Let her drink and calm down. It's wrong. My uncle said that stealing is wrong. I will put it back. - OK, put it back. What can I do? Oh God! Ticket, ticket! Take your ticket! Sir, your tickets. Ten rupees per head and thirty for you three. Buy the tickets. I'll buy the tickets but give the money. We took the wrong train because of you. Buy them. We've carried you from Rajamundry. Should we carry you home? We don't have any money. - I don't either. We know there's no money there. The 700 rupees are in there. Take it. 700? But it should be 2,000 rupees. - That's right. But in the bus we had to buy tickets from the conductor. You were sound asleep. I didn't want to disturb you, so I took out your money. Afterwards, thinking we shouldn't take others' money, I put it back. At 9 o'clock the bus stopped for breakfast... Once again, I took your money out. We ate parathas. Since I didn't want to steal from you... I put it back there. At 1 o'clock I think... The bus stopped again for tea. I took it out again. Then I thought... You shouldn't steal from others and put it back? Exactly! To take money from here whenever you wish, do you think it's some ATM? Oh God! Chanti. You're here? Yes, I am here... ...but first you stop keeping money over there. Why? - Thieves might steal it. Who would steal it from here? Both my mom and grandma used to keep money here. That's what had put me in trouble. - What happened? Nothing really. - Bhanu, why are you late? I didn't get the train, daddy. - There are a number of trains. Anyway, how much longer will you study? For three more months. - Still three more months? OK, go inside to freshen up and eat something. We need to get her married as soon as her studies are over. She is a young girl. Find out if there is anyone in her heart. So that we can get her married to him? No, so that we could make her forget him. I didn't get her into a city-college, so that she can marry some idiot. But to find an American match for her. Hey, bring me down. My head is spinning. Don't kill me. So Pushpa darling, is that ok? When I was a kid, you used to ask me to marry you. Will you marry me now? So you wanted to kill me to marry her? What's the use even if you are alive? What are you saying! I heard your husband was the best wrestler in the village. That's past history. You should have seen him show his tricks with the stick. But now he can't even lift a stick. Who is this kid? My name is Srinu, I am his friend. - He is so sweet. I have got some fans in your village. Am I so sweet? You are as sweet as our dog. How rude she is! Who are they? They look after our farms and house here. Let's go inside. Pushpa darling, we'll catch up later. I will try my best to avoid you. Why hasn't this idiot come yet? - He is here. Father can't stay without me. - It's not me, it's your uncle. He's been asking about you since morning. Go and meet him. Uncle, if you select a nice matching shirt, I'll get ready soon. Hey, does my brother look like a fashion designer to you? Fashion started with my uncle. I heard when he was young, girls used to chase him... ...no matter what he was wearing! I'm thinking of following the same path. Great. No one needs to teach you such things though. You are plain jealous. OK, thanks for giving me the good news, goodbye. What is it? He said the land we lost in auction a few days ago is not worth 250 crores... ...but 400 crores. Call my brother. Brother. - Yes, brother. I couldn't harm that Rama Krishna for the past 20 years. I heard that he came to our village along with his family. You must insult him in the village... ...he was born and brought up in. Along with his reputation, he will also lose his hand and leg. I will give you this news very soon. He is my brother. - I hope you can say that tomorrow. Greetings. - I'm here year round, but no one salutes me. And you, in spite of being here for just couple of days a year, people salute you and touch your feet, brother-in-law. That's my brother's greatness. Hey, Rama Krishna! What's wrong with you! You are calling an elderly man... ...with his first name? What is wrong with you? If you enter the battlefield you will know what's wrong with me. What are you staring at! I heard you fought a lot when you were young. Come. Let's have a small fight. - You wanna fight? - Chanti. Hey, you're getting angry when I abuse him? Hey, if you have courage dare to touch even one of us. If you win I will leave this village. But if I win... With a garland in your hand, you'll welcome my brother, that you've expelled... ...back into the village. OK? - What are you still waiting for, brother-in-law? Break his hands and legs, this village will get rid of a nuisance. We came to this village to celebrate Shankranti... ...but not fight people. Come on, Chanti. What's the matter you are stepping back like sissies? You came here on Shankranti. You should at least have as much courage as cocks. Don't you eat saIt and pepper? Uncle, he is crossing the line. No, he wants us to cross the line. Dressing up like a man is not enough... You also need to have manliness. You dared us to hit at least one of you. I will leave none of you! Come forward. What did you say a while ago? Cock. Clothes. Manliness. Show me your manliness. I want to see your manliness. If I get that stick again, I will insert it into you. Show me. Take that stick. Take it. Take it! No, no. Chanti, stop it. Will you never change? Didn't you hear what he said? When a mad dog barks, I just ignore it. But I am not like you. I will bury this scoundrel... What more can you do... ...except ruining our reputation! Your father is...! - Yes. Don't mind him. - I don't. You did a favor to this village by thrashing this scoundrel. Don't praise me so much, I'll get cursed. I will ward them off, but first tell me, will you marry me? Marry you? If your boyfriend knows about it, he will kill me. Do one thing. Find the most beautiful girl of this district, I will marry her. Why are you blushing? ''A bit, a little bit.'' ''A bit, a little bit.'' ''You are a bit mischievous.''

The real bad news is here. First of all stop digging here. Why? - Rama Krishna is digging a hole for there. Have you gone mad? - You will get mad if you see them. Look there. He is selling flats for 1,000 rupees per square foot. If he sells for such a low amount he'll face a great loss. Has Rama Krishna gone mad? Why is he doing this? On the occasion of our company's 25th anniversary... ...we started this venture to give you flats for low rates. Once upon a time we were also a middle-class family. My father also wished to own a house. But by the time we reached the position to own a flat, ...he wasn't there to see it. Just like my father... Lots of people dream of owning a house. That's why, without expecting any profits, ...if we build homes for you, ...our father's soul will rest in peace. We would finish this venture as soon as possible. If they finish this project they will turn into gods for people. You mean he is a demon? I will turn their dream project into death-project. Greetings, Mr. Umapati. Please sit down. I would've come to you had you given me a call. You have reached another level right now. You are the one who helped me reach this level. I can step down any number of stairs for you. I don't care if you have to step down stairs or kill people, But I want R.K. Builders' Jana Nivas project... ...to have its approval canceled. Sir, I will approve your papers even if there are discrepancies. But R. K. Builders papers have no loopholes. If I cancel it now, I will lose my job. So? We need to send you briefcases without you asking... ...but you won't do anything for us. We can't cancel something once we have approved it. You can't? Hey, call the minister. Hello! Greetings, sir. Minister is on line. I am Umapati speaking. R. K. Builders are building Jana Nivas. You have to stop it. Tell me where you are. I'll come there. Where will you come? I am in Bangkok right now. Meet me when I come back. There's no Jana Nivas or anything. I am here. I will destroy it. - Come here fast. Come fast. Clean it properly. The car-owner should faint after he sees our work. - OK. Clean it. Nani, is the car-servicing done? - Yes, sir, it's done. We will ward off the evil eye and you can take it. You will ward off the evil eye from the car? - Yes, sir. That's a sentiment. - Very good. I like people with sentiments. I am also very sentimental with this car. - Really, sir? Who do you think this car is? It's my son. - ls it your son? Then how are you traveling sitting on your son, sir? Children should carry the burden of aging parents, right? Very interesting, sir. You story has a great sentiment, sir. You know what happened once? How would I know it unless you tell me, sir? A guy picked the wallet from my son's pocket. - Come on, sir. Cars don't have pockets. I mean he stole petrol from the tank. I took him to the blood bank... ...took one liter of blood and sold it. Sold whom? The thief? - No, his blood. Blood for blood. It's a superb title, sir. Hey, bring the coconut. No, brother. He is very attached to his car. Remember what happened the last time. Hey, do not underestimate me. That's why I made a special arrangement. Boys, cover the glass. Don't feel bad, sir. It's just a headlight that broke. That's not a headlight, it's my son's eye. You made my son blind? Oh God! Oh God! It was car's right headlight, but he hit on my left eye. Oh God! I'll stay quiet, or else he will hit me again. Oh God! Hey! Hey! Hey! What are you doing here? - Uncle asked me to come here. Which uncle? - Your father is my father's childhood friend. He asked me to leave the hostel and stay here. So what? You can't come here and act as if this is your house. What's this? You don't know? - I will make you leave right now. Father. Yes, son. - Who is that in my room? She's studying here. Change your language. First, change her room. - Not possible. Till her exams are over, she will stay there. If you are so fond of her, you can even write her exams. Now tell me where I will stay. - In my room. Why? So that you can lecture me even in my sleep? I find some place to stay. But remember... ...you made my room a scapegoat for your reputation. You have become so tall, but your brain hasn't grown. You aren't even tall! What did uncle say? - What will he say? He said if I don't like it I can throw you from the terrace. But since you are a girl, I said I will go somewhere. Really? - Yes, you heard it right. Arrange my clothes and shift to the room downstairs. Listen, there's a small problem in this room. Why? The AC doesn't work. - You want an AC as well? It's not that. It comes at 12 O'clock midnight. What will come? - Tilottama. A girl with that name used to stay in front of our house. She tried to win me over. Why would she come here at midnight? That's the time spirits wander around. Spirit? Yes, it's a spirit. It's been a year since she died. As I didn't give her a green signal she turned into a devil. Midnight at 12 O' clock! Be careful! Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! If I got so scared then that girl... She would vacate the room in a second. Who are you? - It's me, Tilottama. Tilottama? I was just kidding with her... ...but you came here for real? - To take revenge. In previous birth you betrayed me in love. - Me? I just flirt with girls once in a while. That's all I do. OK, then, now you love. - You? No, love Bhanu who came to your house. She is even more dangerous than you. Hey, if you say one more word about that girl, I will bite your throat. Love Bhanu. How can you ask me to love someone at gunpoint! First I need to get that feeling. I will think about it and tell you. I will come here again. You must say yes. You may go now. Go. What a rubbish idea! Chanti, there's a wedding mall in Panjagutta, right? - Yes. Where is it, son? - A flyover collapsed few days ago, right? It's in front of it. - You know where exactly it is? Yes. - Then take us there this evening. Oh aunt, you put me in trouble. - It's Shailu's engagement. We need to buy ornaments. The groom's family members are also coming. Really! OK, then, I will take you there, aunt. Take one more idli. - No, thanks, aunt. I have some urgent work. - What's so urgent? My plans came to a stop. - But what did you plan? I never saw you do anything. No need for your praises in the early morning. Tell me what the matter is. - Drop Bhanu at her college. You will be doing something for a change. Shall I not bring her back? - Do I have to mention it? Shall I also buy her balloons and ice-creams on the way? I am not going to drop her anywhere. Ask her to go alone. Remove your hand. Your occupied my room and made me a watchman. Now you want to get on my bike and make me your driver. I will stab you. Get lost. Oh! Girl, you didn't go to college yet? - I am going, uncle. How will you go? Chanti. - Yes, uncle. Drop her at her college. I was just thinking that when you asked. Give him money for petrol. I gave it to him long ago, brother. It's been a year since you gave me 100 rupees. Madam, come on, let's go. - Bye, uncle. If it's not to put me in trouble tell me... ...what would you achieve by studying so much? I'll give you injections. I will study hard and be a doctor. So you are trying to get a license to commit murders. Did Tilotamma come last night? Do we really have to talk about it now? You're the one who said that she comes every night. So I was wondering if she came. Yes, she came and we talked for a while. And when I said that l am pretty tired she left. Didn't she say anything else? Yes, she said she is getting bored these days. Will you go to her? I am serious. Both of you are lovers, right? I wanted to know if she talked about love and all. Yes, she got some idiot. Hey! Huh? It seems both of you are maintaining great distance. Where did you find her? On the street or in a bar? Hey, if you talk too much I will break your bones. Oh God! You're so aggressive. Are you drunk already? Hey, you go to the shed. I will come. Be careful. If you don't give her snacks with the drinks, she'll eat you. - Come soon. - OK! OK! Why do you befriend such idiots? It makes me feel relatively superior. Take out everything there in the shop. They will buy one. You stay quiet. See this one, dear. I didn't like it, mom. Check this one. How is this one? I don't like this one either, sister-in-law. Then what do you want? Your daughter-in-law doesn't like our selection. You select one for her. - Brother-in-law knows well. - Me? How would I know about these ladies things! - Really? Would you be signaling her like a traffic constable if you didn't know? Actually it's... What, brother-in-law? You're already making my sister dance to your tune? Enough laughing. Do it fast. Sister-in-law, you go and see that diamond ring. We will go there as soon as we're done here. - OK. Come on! Come on! Get going. I'm sorry. Madam. - Show me the latest diamond rings. One minute. I'll bring them, madam. Did you like it? - I haven't seen them yet. Not the ring, but the touch. He clashed with you. Did you like it? Don't change the expression. Stay normal. I don't even know who he is. If you didn't know him, you should've held him by the collar and slap him. Did you like him? It was just by accident... It wasn't by accident... You must've bumped into him out of habit. Why do you talk like that? You're thinking that it would have been great... ...if I hadn't seen it, right? What's this! You didn't say anything when he did that... ...but you feel bad when I talk about it? Our family's here. Wipe your crocodile tears and come. Bubble gums. Bubble gums. How many bubble gums... ...do you want? Uncle. - What? Will you tell us a nice story? - Story. I will tell you a great story. I am coming. What sort of a story do you want to hear? Tell us a new story, uncle. - A new story? Once upon a time there was a king. That king had seven sons. One day they go hunting... And bring seven fishes, right? - How did you guess that? ls that a story? Now I understand why grandpa is always scolding you. We thought it was only between you and grandpa... But the generation gap exists even between us! I will tell you the story. Hear it. - Tell me. - It's a dark night. Complete darkness. Nothing is visible. - You can switch on the light. They switched it on. Boom! The light exploded. In that darkness a ghost comes in a white sari. It came closer. It came even closer. The head turned. - Whose? - The ghost's. The opening is already frightening. I wonder what I'll become if I hear the rest. - Hey, you continue... - And that ghost... Hail Lord Anjineya! Hail Lord Anjineya! Hail Lord Anjineya! Hail Lord Anjineya! Hail Lord Anjineya! Bhagwad Gita! When we have so many weapons... ...even if Tilotamma's grandma comes here she can't harm me. Oh God! Hey, switch off the lights. Chanti. - Who? It's me Tillu. - Tillu? Uncle. Aunt. Father. Ghost. Ghost. Ghost. What? What happened? - There's a ghost, uncle. There's a ghost over here. - You still believe in ghosts? You must've had a nightmare. - He himself is a nightmare. Oh my ATM! - Have some water and sleep. Uncle, I am fine now. You go and sleep. I will also sleep. Tilottama. - What? Today I met the priest in the temple. Those who die unmarried and without losing virginity... ...they turn into white sari-wearing ghosts and lose control. That's why... - That's why... If you lose your virginity now you would reach heaven. I made up my mind. Come on, let's do it. Tillu. Tillu, listen to me. Stop there, Tillu. Come, just five minutes. Tillu, come. Tillu. Tillu. Tillu. Where will you go now? Who do you think Chanti is? One-eyed demon! And you dared to scare this Chanti? ...love you. - What? l... - Don't mumble. Say it aloud. I love you. - Oh God! ''There's a home in the heart. It's still vacant.'' ''Would you like to stay there?'' ''Will you give me a kiss as rent?'' ''If there's a home in the heart. If it's vacant.'' ''I definitely stay there.'' ''I will give you myself in rent.'' ''Can you shift into it right away?'' ''Will you open its doors?'' ''Will you sign an agreement to stay in it for hundred years?'' ''There's a home in the heart. It's still vacant.'' ''Would you like to stay there?'' ''Will you give me a kiss as rent?'' ''You are a beautiful devil.'' ''I am scared of you.'' ''I fought with you. It's the beginning of our love-story.'' ''You detected my problem.'' ''You treated it with a smile.'' ''I lost my aggression. Now our love would blossom.'' ''You came to me as a surprise and presented me bliss.'' ''You came to me as a boon and made me intoxicated.'' ''You entered my life and made me fall in love.'' ''There's a home in the heart. It's still vacant.'' ''Would you like to stay there?'' ''Will you give me a kiss as rent?'' ''You were a burden to me all these days.'' ''You burnt me all the times.'' ''Today you garlanded me. Now you are my destination.'' ''I used to curse you all these days.'' ''I abused you all the time.'' ''I understood my fault. Now you are my world.'' ''You are the bright spot of my life.'' ''You make me swing in joy.'' ''First you tormented me and then turned into my life.'' ''There's a home in the heart. It's still vacant.'' ''Would you like to stay there?'' ''Will you give me a kiss as rent?'' ''Can you shift into it right away?'' ''Will you open its doors?'' ''Will you sign an agreement to stay in it for hundred years?'' ''There's a home in the heart. It's still vacant.'' ''If there's a home in the heart. If it's vacant.'' ''Would you like to stay there?'' ''I will give you myself in rent.'' Hello! What's this, sister-in-law! Everyone is eagerly awaiting the engagement tomorrow... ...and here you are... - I don't want this family... ...to lose its reputation because of me. But what happened that we'd lose reputation, sister-in-law? When we went shopping for the engagement... ...I went to the trial room to change the dress... ...and someone shot me there with secret camera... ...and is blackmailing me? He calls me everyday and abuses me. He says if I don't go to the place he asks me to come... ...he would release it on the internet... ...or send a copy to your brother. And for that you want to die? What's your fault in this? Why didn't you tell my brother? You don't know your brother well. In the beginning of our marriage... ...he said there shouldn't be any secrets between us. I told him about a guy who liked me in college. From that day onwards he tortures me everyday. And now if he learns about this... ...he would think that I did it intentionally. Instead of telling him about it, it's far better to commit suicide. What's this, sister-in-law! You want your children to be motherless like me? Never ever think such a thing again. Forget everything. I will take care of him. Hey, where is your boss? - He's there upstairs. Who are you, sir? You shoot women with secret cameras, scoundrel! You blackmail family ladies in such a way... ...that she could not tell anyone! Rascal! Hey! Tell me where that reel is. Give me that reel or I will break your legs. Where is it? - I'll tell you. I'll tell you. Take it out. Take it out. - I'll take it out. Take it out. - I will. I will. Here... Here is your CD. Take your CD. You record such things? I am not filing a police case against you... ...as it would ruin our reputation. If you do such a thing again I will kill you, scoundrel. Who did this to my son? Greetings. Greetings. Please come in. Sir, did you tell the groom's family to leave the house... ...exactly at the time I told you? Our Chanti went there to bring them. Greetings, uncle. - You are Purushottam's son, right? It's his good fortune, uncle. - What do you do? Not one thing, uncle. But office work, house-work, site-work, without a pause, I want to do everything! But since my family doesn't leave it for me... ...I just supervise them. - So you're a good-for-nothing fellow! Uncle has got a great sense of humor. Get in. Get in. Get in. It's my engagement. - My time will also come. Why? Your family didn't give you the green signal yet? If they had, I wouldn't have taken this loop line... ...the vehicle would've already been running. Sir, the formalities are done. You can exchange the betel leaves if the groom's family comes. The groom's family is here. Go and bring auspicious water. Why are they coming here? Stop there. Stop there. Please. I am talking to you. Stop there. Stop there. Find out that Chanti. Brother, he's there. - Please come. Please come. Come here. Come here, scoundrel. What do you think you are doing? Get lost from here. You want me to get lost? Uncle. Uncle. Uncle. - What? He raised his hand on my uncle... - Enough. You gave us a great reception. - Please tell him... Father, at least hear him out. - You're mad or what! Come. He's saying something... - Shut your mouth and come... Get out of here. Get out. Until now your fights were confined to the streets... ...but now you brought them home. Get out. He made a mistake. That's why I thrashed him. What has he done wrong? You said you thrashed him because he made a mistake. What has he done wrong? What will he say, brother! Fathering him was my mistake. Father. - No. Don't call me that. The moment some goon dared to touch my brother... ...this family lost its reputation. Get out! Purushottam. - No, brother. Don't support him today. I can't tolerate the disrepute he brought to us today. I beg you. Don't stop me. Hey, get lost! Why are you still standing there? Get lost. What? First you broke your sister's match... ...and now you're standing here shamelessly? Get out! Hey, if you really want to do something good for this family, get lost from here. Get lost from here. All these days you didn't have a mother. Now you don't have a father as well. Get lost. Get lost. Get lost. Stop there. Stop there. Take it. Get lost. Get lost. What a useless car! We can't repair it. Hello, Nani! - Greetings, sir. ls my car ready? - It's ready, sir. Sir, listen to me. Sell it for 10,000 rupees... ...add 90,000 to it and buy a new car for one lakh, sir. But I need to get rid of the old one, right? ls it sentimental, sir? No, it's attachment. I see. - I got this car in dowry when I married my wife. In the beginning I used her lot, later I got bored and left her. You mean your wife? - No, the car. Then one day she created a big scene. - The car? No, my wife. That I neglected her. - Your wife? No, the car. Then I looked after her for a while. - The car. No, my wife. Then I got fed up and left her in the outskirts... Sir, what have you done! You left your wife on the outskirts of the town? What's wrong with you! I left the car. - The car. Then police found my address and brought her back home. Sir, I will guess it right this time. It's the car that the police brought back, right? - Correct. - Yes. I am unable to get rid of my wife and this car... ...but I'm losing money. It's difficult, sir. Everyone has their sentiments. Pappu, bring that coconut. Brother, this sentiment won't work out for us. Leave it, brother. - Shut up! Just because Sachin was getting out in 90s, he didn't stop hitting centuries. Mine is also the same policy. Just keep on watching. Boys, come on! Cover the entire car. Yes. Oh God! Did you hear the sound that the coconut made? It's not the coconut that broke... Hey, forget whatever happened. It's easier said than done. Did your father ever kick you out of the house? I too used to hate when someone got emotional. Only when you are away from your family... ...you understand how hard it is and the value of family. Sister-in-law and Bhanu are coming. Come, sister-in-law. You are hanging out with this ghost? She will scare you. You are facing this only because of me. It's not new for me. The only thing is that father... ...increased the intensity and asked me to leave. That's all. You take everything lightly. And why should you stay outside and suffer for me? I will tell everyone the truth. Sister-in-law, you know what will happen if you tell the truth. My brother doubted you and you tried to commit suicide... If uncle learns that... ...he'd kick my brother out and the entire city will know about it. Then not yours, but uncle's reputation will be gone. Instead of you separating from brother, it's better if I stay here. Even my own brother wouldn't have done this much for me. I don't know how to thank you. - What's this, sister-in-law! Would you make me an outsider by thanking me? Do you know something? My father can stay without me, but uncle can't. He would call for me in a day or two. I'll be back. Tilottama, take my sister-in-law back home. You carry on, sister-in-law. I will be back! You carry on. Go. Brother... Check these documents and I'll send them for approval. I will check them later. First you go and bring Chanti home. Why should he stay outside as if he doesn't have a family? He will work hard. Let him work hard, brother. Only then will he know what life is. Our home lost its luster since he's gone. If he is here this home will lose its reputation, sister-in-law. Brother, I never went against your word. Please let me take this one decision. Nani, you are really great. Even Bill Gates can't beat you in helping others. - Why? Bill Gates? Where is his shed? - I will slap you. He is not a mechanic! He is a billionaire! A few days ago he donated half his wealth and it was in all the news. Brother, give me this shed and get your name in the papers. If he gives you his shed... He won't be in any paper! But he's sure to become a pauper and die on the streets. Right, Nani? Keep talking. Both of you carry on. Why are you dragging me into it now? Get lost, scoundrel! Stop here. Oh God! She's coming here? - Take it. Why? ls it not proper to drink in front of a lady? If she sees this we won't have anything to drink. She drinks? She drank a quarter of gin like water once. Oh God! Then let's hide it in the bottle. - Last time we hid it in the bottle. Let's hide these glasses. Come. Hi! - Hi! - What are you doing? I swear on him we are not drinking, just some snacks. Where is Chanti? - He went out. Wherever he has gone, he will come back here. I will wait for him. Why did she settle here? - She will give us a hard time. Let's go to somewhere else. He would get bored and leave. She might finish the snacks. - The liquor is enough for us. ls that so? OK. We will be back in a while, ok? Come. It must be too spicy for her. Oh God! I can't drink water from their water bottles. Oh God! Look there. You can't bear to see this sight. Who is she? People eat stuff after having a drink. But she is drinking after eating stuff. - Our misfortune. Oh! - What's the matter? What happened? We don't know if she does it intentionally or not, but that girl is drinking again. She is drinking in broad daylight? You tell that to her. Go. Why are you here? I came for you. - For me? Exams are over. I will go our to my village... ...and tell my father about our love story. If he says yes, we'd directly consummate our wedding. She brought up the topic of marriage? Quite natural. She is drunk. You are too drunk. Come with me I will tell you. Come. ''Colorful rain, it's bewitching rain.'' ''I am overwhelmed when it touches me.'' ''Vivacious rain, it's overpowering rain.'' ''I am set on flames when it wraps me.'' ''Shall I come? Shall I come close to you...'' ''...and remove all the shackles?'' ''Shall I take you into my arms?'' ''Shall I kill the cold?'' ''Shall I shower you with kisses?'' ''This is the root cause of fights between you and me.'' ''Colorful rain, it's bewitching rain.'' ''I am overwhelmed when it touches me.'' ''Vivacious rain, it's overpowering rain.'' ''I am set on flames when it wraps me.'' ''One like cotton, another like a needle...'' ''...these raindrops are tormenting me.'' ''One like a pebble, another like atom bomb,'' ''the first raindrops are hitting my heart.'' ''Rain wants to come with you.'' ''Rain wants to see what is in your heart.'' ''Come and conquer me like the rain.'' ''Vivacious rain, it's overpowering rain.'' ''I am set on flames when it wraps me.'' ''Colorful rain, it's bewitching rain.'' ''I am overwhelmed when it touches me.'' ''Draping the rains, adorning herself with flowers,'' ''my lady is coming like a flood.'' ''Welcome, my prince.'' ''I will turn into a rainbow and garland you.'' ''Rain has drowned me with you in pleasure.'' ''Rain has gifted me my beloved one.'' ''I shall conquer you like the forceful rain.'' ''Colorful rain, it's bewitching rain.'' ''I am overwhelmed when it touches me.'' ''Vivacious rain, it's overpowering rain.'' ''I am set on flames when it wraps me.'' - Greetings, sir. - You can greet me later on. First, check my nephew's condition. - Greetings, sir. - You can greet me later on. First, check my nephew's condition. When can I go out? It will take a week for your back to get well. Three weeks for your neck to get well. It might take one month for your leg to get well. Totally how many days will it take? - It might take six weeks. What's this, sir! You'd rather commit suicide than wait six weeks? Why would I die? I will kill that Chanti. No. Their family is already half dead in your hands. You did what I couldn't for 20 years. One person has gone from that house. I am very happy. - Come outside. Come outside. Come outside. Come outside. What's that? Who are they? - Victims. Flood victims. - No. The victims of our flats. The victims of our flats? I am going to... - Brother-in-law. You stay here. I will see them. - Come outside. Come outside. Why are you shouting? - You wait a minute. Stay quiet. Stay quiet. Stay quiet. Sir is not at home. Had you come here 10 minutes ago you would've got sir. Come tomorrow. - What! So that you'd shut shop by then? I will see your end. - What will you see? His hand is broken and the other one's leg is broken. Beating them is equal to beating a dog. Go away. What are you saying! R.K. Builders are selling flats for five lakhs... ...and you"re taking 15 lakhs for the same flats? It's not for nothing. A flat's cost depends on the cost of the land. Really? Their flats are right next to your flats. We don't need this discussion. Give our money back. - Impossible. If you can't, we will take you by the scruff. Who will you take? - What's the matter? Your voice is rising? - You went out 10 minutes ago. You returned so fast? - Your intentions are clear by this. Hey, if you raise your voice I will slash your tongue. Bring your hand down. We are giving you one week's time. By then, if we don't get our money... -Hey. Give it back or we will go to the assembly. We will ruin your reputation in the media. We will shut down your company. Let's go. Let's go. Just one week's time. What's this, brother-in-law! Even these beggars are spitting on our faces. Rama Krishna is trying to get smart with me. I will give him a major blow. I will take the life of his family member. Kill him without anyone's knowledge. Srinu. - Yes. Do you really have to mortgage your locket to throw a party? Nani has been asking for it for a long time. Your family won't say anything? Why would my family say anything! It's Nani's chain. You... Hey, Bachi is here. Why is he coming here with his men? You probably didn't bash him enough a while back. So he's here for another beating. We can throw a party for Nani later. Let's give him one first. N- Let's! You wanted to give them a party. Why are you back? My father is buying fruits here. He kicked me out of the house because I thrashed him once. If he sees me thrashing him again... He will also leave the house? He won't let me step inside the house again. Because of Amitabh Bachchan, Gabbar Singh has escaped. Let's go. Let's go. Come here. Father, he came to kill you. - Shut up! Why would he come to kill me? Am I a goon like you? He's the one who came to our house that day, right? Hey, you will never change. - That's not the thing, father... No, don't show me your face again. Father. Father, listen to me. Father, listen... Have you knocked down Purushottam? Knocked down? You are safe only till I am at home. When I am outside no one can stop me. I'll slash your heads. While I am here, you can't even touch my family. Chanti! Why are you like that? What happened? I thought he would change when he is away from home. He will not change in this birth, brother. - He will change. I don't think so, brother. Every time I see him I think 'why I am still alive'. Even when I think of him, I feel like dying, brother. Sir. Sir. What's the matter, sir? Are you not well? No, it's not that... Just... Move aside. Move aside. What will you settle? Will you steal at home or will you sell your home? Hey, what's going on! Who are they? Sir, we are cricket bookies. In 20-20 series that took place a few days ago... ...they bet 10 lakh rupees and lost it. I am asking for that money and they are making us... ...circle around them. - What is he saying! It's not that we can't extract it. We came to your office. We can even come to your home to extract it. But before that we just wanted to inform you about it. Please. Please. Mr. Shivamani. - Yes. Settle their account and send them. - OK, sir. Come. - Goodbye, sir. What's this! Do we need all this? lsn't our hard-earned money enough for us? Do we have to gamble to make a few bucks? A lot of people depend on us and our company. If such news leaks out, can your father take it? And what do you lack? I give you all you want. Hey, who are you to give us money? This is our father's property. You are behaving as if you are giving us money. We will spend our money the way we want to. Who are you to question us? If we want to buy saris for our wives... or undergarments for our kids... We need to ask you for money. What an unfortunate life! After your wife died... ...our father sheltered you and your son. Hey, you are a worker in this company like everyone else. They get a salary and you get respect. You are a worker. Don't forget your limits. If you try to get smart with us... Let's go. Doctor. - Why is it that the first attack is so serious? Did he hear some shocking news? - No, doctor. My brother is worried only about his son. He put himself in trouble thinking about his son. His condition is critical, Mr. Rama Krishna. Whatever amount it costs, my brother must survive, doctor. We will try our best, sir. Even when I think of him, I feel like dying, brother. You came to see if he is dead or alive? - Uncle. I could fill your pocket with money... ...but I couldn't fill your heart with love. He might even die if he sees you. You might not need your father, but I need my brother. I need him. Why are you sitting here, Chanti? I can't see father in such condition. Nothing will happen to you, uncle. Have faith in God. You will get well soon. What's the use if I get well, dear? I couldn't even bring up my son well. Don't talk like that about Chanti, uncle. You are a fortunate man to get a son like him. If he wasn't there, I wouldn't have been alive today. What are you saying, girl? - On the day of engagement... ...he fought those goons for me, uncle. I went shopping for Shailu's engagement and... Even though you mistook him, insulted him... ...Chanti left home silently only to hide this truth, uncle. You should be happy about Chanti, not be upset! I want to see him immediately, dear. Chanti, your father wants to see you. Really? - He called you immediately. Go fast. Father. Sit down. Forgive me. - What are you saying, father! By the time I came to know about you... ...my time has... - You will be fine, father. You will be fine. I don't mind. I am happy to know that I fathered a great son. Don't talk like that, father. All these days I couldn't understand you. I feIt upset that you hadn't done anything, But I didn't think even once about doing something for you. Let's not talk about that now, dad. As a father, I haven't given you property. I am giving your responsibilities. Both your brothers are trying to make money though shortcuts. I know that, father. Take good care of... Take good care of uncle. I will, father. Doctor. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. Father. Sir, our Chanti... Who does he have other than you, sir! All those relations died with my brother. When he is not there, I don't want anyone else! Lord! Open it. You never donated even a single rupee till now! And today you donated ten lakhs? We spent 25 lakhs, but couldn't kill Purushottam. Without a knife, without any spilling of blood, without any case, without spending a single rupee, he killed him just like that. I took a decision today, God is my partner! You are so happy that it seems like you would... ...donate a golden crown for our Lord. - Just a crown? If his family is destroyed, I will even build a temple. His brother is not there. I will trap that Rama Krishna in a new problem everyday... ...and play with him. Hey, Nani! - Hey, Nani? Thank God she didn't call me coolie. Why did she come here at this time? Do you have any sense? I should be the one to look after him when he is down, right? Bring the luggage in. Is it a shed or a lodge? Someone is checking-in everyday. I told father about our love affair. He ignored it and is looking for a match for me. We have our own sketches. I told him that I want to study more and got into Godavari. You came here to study, right? Go to uncle's place. To uncle's place? I should be with you at such times, right? Why are you standing like a donkey? Tell him, uncle. Donkey? OK, girl. Being called 'a donkey' hurt... ...but being called 'uncle' makes me happy. You stay here, girl. You stay here. No matter what, she will stay here. She will stay here? You are recommending her? Do we need more problems? I won't be a problem. You sleep in one room and l will sleep in another room. This is not Mysore Palace to have so many rooms. There is only one room. - Then in that room, I will sleep on the floor and you sleep on the bed. Then your studies will be ruined. Don't you understand what I say? You can't stay here. Go away. And then... She's alone here. It seems she came straight from her village. Shall we ask her? - Come on. Let's go. Will you come with me? Yes, I will. - What's this? She agreed to come so soon? She's an item. Can't you see that? Talk about her price beforehand, otherwise she will give us trouble later. - Right. How much? I mean what's the rate. - I don't know all that. My man is there inside. Go and ask him. The mediator is there upstairs. Who's that? Who are you? Why did you come here at this time? There's one item outside. Just wanted to know its rate. What's there outside? They are talking about the old Hero Honda bike. Sell it. Didn't you have some other time to negotiate? You come at your own time? What's this got to do with time, sir? It depends on our mood, right? What? You liked it? - We liked it a lot, sir. Did you like the color? - Superb, sir. First of all tell us its rate. We can't control ourselves, sir. ls it so tempting? - Yes. Then pay 15,000 rupees. - 15,000? You are surprised to hear 15,000? It's a great company. It would be very comfortable. You saw the seat, right? - It's superb. But 15,000 is still too much. Make it 5,000. What! 5,000? Then there's a black one in the other shed. You can take that one. - No, we don't want a black one. We want the white one. - You want the white one? Then pay 15,000 rupees and take it. It's still very new. Police won't catch you. Police won't catch us? - They won't. All the papers are available. Papers? - You didn't get it? I am saying we have RC book, insurance papers and all... What are you talking about? It's about the girl over there, right? - The girl over there? So you were bargaining about the girl over there? I am not the owner of that vehicle. He's there inside. I will call him. Hey, someone came for your vehicle. There are customers for Bhanu. What's the rate, sir? Sir, why are you beating us? She's the one who asked us to talk to you about the rate. Go and ask that girl. Don't ask us. Why are you talking about rate and all! What can I do! You didn't let me come in. And if I don't? You will create a scene here? If you still don't let me come in, I will send whoever comes here to you. - Oh God! Where did I get this girl? - At the railway station. OK, come in. ''Tell me where we shall go and where we shall lay the cot.'' ''Tell me fast. We would definitely go.'' ''Tell me where we shall go and where we shall lay the cot.'' ''Tell me fast. We would definitely go.'' ''In the park. - There would be a number of people.'' ''On the beach. - There would be couples like us.'' ''Come to me. Come to me. Decide the place.'' ''The fire can't be quenched any other way.'' ''Why are you delaying, oh beauty?'' ''I will find a place where no one would come.'' ''Don't be hasty. I will take you to the zenith of pleasure.'' ''Tell me where we shall go and where we shall lay the cot.'' ''Tell me fast. We would definitely go.'' ''When the hand pinches the cheeks,'' ''eyes shouldn't be able to see them.'' ''When I dribble my fingers on your waist,'' ''I shouldn't hear murmurs from you.'' ''In this journey of lips,'' ''I don't want any obstacles.'' ''If you know any such place, do tell me, girl.'' ''I am ready to go there even if it's far away.'' ''On some branch. - Monkeys will watch us.'' ''On the hill. - Eagles might chase us.'' ''I will find a place where no one would come.'' ''Don't be hasty. I will take you to the zenith of pleasure.'' ''The matter shouldn't leak out come what may.'' ''The sound shouldn't go out when I kiss you.'' ''Once we get started...'' ''...we can't stop it.'' ''Give me a great place...'' ''...and I will show you what heaven is.'' ''In Antarctica... - We will face penguins.'' ''In Amazon basin... - There will be anacondas.'' ''In the midst of hugs and kisses...'' ''...I will surrender myself to you.'' Sir, Mr. Purushottam insured his life with our company. If you check these papers and sign them... - My sign? He gave your name as the nominee, sir. If you get his death certificate... ...and other documents ready, we will take it tomorrow. Goodbye, sir. Greetings, Mr. Rama Krishna. You are wondering why the enemy come to your home? They say we shouldn't held any auspicious ceremony... ...in a house where something has gone wrong, Knowingly or unknowingly your daughter's match... ...was broken because of us. I have only one son. If you don't have any objection, we came here to ask for your daughter's hand for our son. You can't fight him from the front. So you want to stab him in the back? Scoundrel! They ditched you. And I came to shake hands with you. It's not in our culture to ask our guests to leave. I think he still hasn't forgotten the past. At least you talk to your father. My father still hasn't gotten over uncle's death. We will convince him. You carry on. What are you saying, sister-in-law! Hey, who let this goon inside? Kick him out. Sir, just listen to me once. What shall I listen to? Get out of here first. Me and my anger are the reason behind what happened that day. Scold me or beat me, but don't show your anger on my sister. Please. - I won't change my decision for anyone. Then you will get your son married against his wish... ...and ruin his life, sir? For me, my family's reputation is important. We also have a good reputation, sir. I feel like laughing when you talk about reputation. A goon like you is Rama! And your uncle is like Dasharatha! What sort of a family is yours? - Hey! How dare you? You held my collar in my own house? I will kill you. Beat me, sir. Why did you stop? Beat me till your anger is gone. You feIt so angry when I held your collar... I too feIt the same way when a goon held my uncle's collar, sir. You are elders. You might not have exchanged betel leaves. But they have exchanged their hearts. Please make my sister your daughter-in-law, sir. If you still think what I have done is wrong... ...I will touch your feet. - What are you doing! A person who touches someone's feet... ...for his sister's welfare, is not a goon. You would conduct this marriage? - No. Till my uncle calls me back I won't be fortunate enough to bless the couple. Even if I am not there... ...my sister's marriage should take place well. Definitely! It will happen as you wish. What's this, Shailu, you are crying like a kid. I am leaving without meeting my youngest brother. He didn't even come to the airport. How can he come when everyone is here! We shall call him as soon as we reach there. Come. Excuse me, madam! Somebody is calling you. Sorry, you can't go out. Let's go. Uncle, I don't know how to tell you this, but I saw your daughter Bhanu with Chanti. It seems he trapped your daughter when she was in our home. Ever since she came here... Bhanu hasn't been in our house even once, uncle. We heard she's been staying at a mechanic shed along with him. We have got nothing to do with that goon. Don't blame us if something goes wrong tomorrow. We called you here so that you can reprimand her and take her back. Alright. Uncle. Chanti is not such sort of a person. They complained to you against him... ...because of their personal enmity. Chanti is a very nice guy. You think I don't know that? My daughter lies to me that she's still staying at your place. But the day Bhanu went to him, Chanti called me. Nowadays, children elopes with their lovers... But when my daughter went to him, asking to marry him... He called me and asked me to take her back. At that particular moment, I decided that he's my son-in-law. When your husband called me here urgently, I didn't know what it was about. Had I known it was about this, I wouldn't have come. Goodbye, dear. Hello! - It's me, Kalyani speaking. Your father agreed to your match with Chanti. Really? Sister, if you were here, I would've kissed you. Save your kisses till marriage and give them to your husband. ''The white sari is ok. The jasmine flowers are ok.'' ''The arrangements are ok. The music is ok.'' ''The parrot is ok. The myna is ok.'' ''The wedding hall is ok. The wedding chants are ok.'' ''I'll be ok if you tie my nuptial thread.'' ''I'll surrender myself to you.'' ''I will present myself to you.'' ''For me, a cot is ok. Your beauty is double ok.'' ''I will make you scream at daytime.'' ''The white sari is ok. The jasmine flowers are ok.'' ''The arrangements are ok. The music is ok.'' ''I have gone crazy.'' ''I am intoxicated in your love.'' ''I was going wild.'' ''Just a while ago.'' ''I can't resist myself.'' ''You are just yummy.'' ''I am very eager...'' ''...ever since you came.'' ''Kill me with your looks and take me into your arms.'' ''Shower me with love and make me your own.'' ''Bring milk, fruits and a pillow and let's make merry.'' ''After my blood started to boil...'' ''...I bid goodbye to my sari, it's ok, it's ok.'' ''The white sari is ok. The jasmine flowers are ok.'' ''The arrangements are ok. The music is ok.'' ''The parrot is ok. The myna is ok.'' ''The wedding hall is ok. The wedding chants are ok.'' ''When you adorn yourself...'' ''...my heart skips a beat.'' ''I lost my heart when I fell on you.'' ''I don't believe your words.'' ''You give me a lot of trouble.'' ''You have spoilt me completely...'' ''...after I fell in love with you.'' ''I will show you tonight what actual spoiling is.'' ''Do not rob me of my shyness.'' ''Come into my arms before it dawns.'' ''When two bodies unite, we know what mischief is.'' ''If you call me again, it's ok.'' ''The white sari is ok. The jasmine flowers are ok.'' ''The arrangements are ok. The music is ok.'' ''The parrot is ok. The myna is ok.'' ''The wedding hall is ok. The wedding chants are ok.'' What happened to you? - I am celebrating. My brother also turned out to be a good for nothing fellow. That's why I am celebrating. When Purushottam died you were ecstatic... ...that God was on our side. What did we achieve from his death? A marriage took place in their house and we got nothing. That day he got you thrashed by the villagers... ...and today the flat buyers are waiting to beat you to pulp. Will you just apply balm on our wounds or will you ever get even? Greetings, sir. - Greetings. There's a stay order from the court. - Why? This is endowment land. As per law, nothing can be constructed here. The papers are very strong in the petition. The registrar has showed substantial proof... ...that it's an endowment land. Find out how many ways there are... ...to go to court against the stay order. Jana Nivas' construction shouldn't stop at any cost. We can also go to court. But we don't know how long it will take! Even if we wait till then, there is no surety that the verdict will be in our favor. I became a minister after sucking up to many people. If I keep on doing social service... ...when will I get back the money I invested in elections. No money, no work. Go away. Because of people like you I get BP. Hey, people are ruthless! Ministers also have to survive! How can they do it if they're not given one or two lakh every hour? That's how people are, sir. - Hey, stop nodding your head. I stopped it, sir. Tell me the program. - Yes, sir. At 10 O'clock there's a private hospital's opening. What will they give us there? - There will take a free HlV test. I don't want all that. Cancel. Next? At 11 O'clock there is a Union Leaders' meeting. Will they give me anything? They will give their demands. - Ask them not to bother. Tell me something that will get me some money. There's someone's call. Ask him how much he will give me. Hello! - It's me, the minister's brother-in-law. Pass the phone to that idiot. - OK, sir. It's your brother-in-law, sir. - Brother-in-law, you got money? Truckloads of it. Come, I will bury you in them. What's this! Who is he? - Lord Krishna. You heard about Tehelka? - You scoundrel! You are the guy with camera? I have all your history of bribery and affairs... ...on a cassette tape. I got such threats before. By 11 O'clock when you go to the Union Leaders' meeting... ...all your secrets will be out and you'll lose your post. Hey, who are you? What do you want? If you come to the place I tell you within an hour, I will tell you everything. Where are you, buddy? I am here. Lord Krishna, where are you? Tell me. At least play the flute. I will find out where you are. Uncle. Uncle Kamsa, here... - Are you here? How are you? - What's this, uncle? You came with your entire family? You are attending a wedding? Or did you think of killing me once you get the cassette? It's just personal security. You know the dangers we face. A few days ago, on your way to a farmhouse... ...with a beautiful chick, the media chased you, right? What did they do then? - Don't get angry, buddy. You know my history. If you wish, you can bring me down. I'm already already facing bad times these days. You do? You spend 20 days a month in foreign countries... ...and enjoy yourself, right? - It's just for fun. I have to take some bribes to complete the construction... ...of my hotel in Bangkok. That's all. Doesn't it pay well to take girls abroad with fake passports? It's not running well. Last month I sent just one girl to Dubai. Recently, I heard Umapati gave you 4 crores to halt an R.K. Builders venture. Did you spent it all, uncle? He gave me just two crores for that. That scoundrel told you he gave me four crores? Everyone is making me a fool and playing with me, buddy. Including you. ls this your camera? Did I say everything as you wished... ...or is there anything left? You tried to expose me and remove me from my post? You kid! Hey, kill him. I don't think fighting him is such a good idea. You shut up! You go and kill him. We are dead. We are dead. All out, sir. It would be better if we jump from here. Uncle. - He called me. I am a bit smarter than you. Shall I give a finishing touch to this episode? I shot you even better than my friend did. Are you scared? There are lumps in your throat? Lift the stay orders and clear R.K. Builders route. Or else my friend Srinu's talent will be shown on TV... ...and within an hour your life would be ruined. Don't go that far, buddy. I will get it cleared. Hey, come with me. Are you out of your mind? I need to first save my head. Don't say one more word. Hey, who is the guy who filed the case? Listen, you go there and say they were fake cases... ...and take them back. If you are arrested... ...spend some time in government jails. What about the money that you took from me? Assume that you donated that money. My condition is pathetic here. Who is he who scared you so much? I'll just kill him... - Hey! Dare to touch me. I will behead you. How are you happy now? Even if you move a stone from R.K. Builders buildings, I will bury you right there. Hey! - Hey! Blade. I am a blade. By the time you try to hit me I will slit a hundred throats. Don't mess with R.K. Builders! You saw that,right? A hundred throats. Your throats would also be there among them. Go fast and cancel the case. Go. Go. We feared that our dream of owning a house would die. But you are helping us realize our dream, sir. May god bless your family! There are tears in your eyes? I saw happiness in my uncle's face again. And I will see happiness in your face... ...when your uncle calls you back to home. Even if you donate lakhs of rupees in the temple, God is taking their side. All your plans are nullified by that Chanti. I know how to outsmart that Chanti. Hey! - Yes, brother-in-law. - Call Bihari. Terrorists planted bombs in coconuts. It's hard to survive in Hyderabad now. I wonder who has got that coconut now. Brother, warding off the evil eye isn't working out for us. Drop this idea, brother. - What! You are scared that he would also beat us? I'll hit you. What's that, brother? - There's a flower in it. So? - If we break it we would reach the top. Sir, can I break it? - Wait a minute, Nani. There's one more minute left to the auspicious moment. Brother. No, brother. Listen to me. - What? Don't talk like that fool. You think I am an idiot? Look here. What's that, brother? - It's a bag. If I put this coconut in it... ...and break it... ...nothing will get broken. Brother, I am so proud of you. - Just wait and watch. Can I break it now? - Yes, the auspicious moment is here. You can break it now. I will break it, sir. - Wait, Nani! - What, sir? Come here. This is west. Break it with your face towards east. - ls it so? So that's the matter. Sir. You are out of this world. Hello! What! What? What happened? We would be in trouble if we stay here. Come with me. Dear, it's not safe for you to go there right now. Father-in-law, the condition is very critical there. Don't go. Our sons aren't here either. If something goes wrong here right now... You want me to abandon them as they are mere laborers? They are the laborers who sweated for our company. I they are angry, they can hit me. What can be the reason? I didn't see any earthquake. It's because lack of quality. We quoted 3,000 rupees per square foot in that area... ...and he said he would give it for 600-700. How is that possible? See! It's possible if you build homes in this way. I sympathize with the poor families who lost... ...their loved ones due to the greed of R.K. Builders. Open your eyes once. Sir. Sir, why did you come here? You came to count the bodies? My son came to work here for the 200 you give per day. You built these homes with the greed for crores... ...and killed my son. You killed my son. Sir, that day you said... ...you would fulfill a poor man's dream. ls this what fulfilling our dreams is? Believing your words, we gave you all that we had... ...and you built such low-grade houses! Believe me. I didn't betray anyone. You won't lose your money. I will find out why this happened... ...and the reason behind this. This will be done through an inquiry. As a precautionary action, I am arresting you,Mr. Rama Krishna. He's the one who planted the bomb. R.K. Builders are good people. He's the black sheep in their family. Since you didn't get a share... ...you plant bombs and explode buildings? Solve your family matters between yourselves! Why do you take our lives in your fight? We don't need to talk to him. Thrash him. The R.K. Builders collapsed buildings controversy... ...took a new turn. Since he couldn't get a share of the property... ...RK newphew confessed that he planted a bomb there in his anger... He saved the company with just one lie. What have you done? I didn't find any other way to save my uncle. That's why I lied that l planted a bomb. - You lied? But the police report proved it was really caused by a bomb. If you don't get the person who planted the bomb, you can't escape from this, Chanti. Sir, we are in trouble. That Bihari planted the bomb even without my knowledge... ...but Chanti found it out. But Chanti is in jail, right? He came out on bail an hour ago. Listen to me and shift him to some other place. If Chanti gets him you would also go to jail along with him. Find him. He is right here, brother-in-law. Hey, get up. - What happened? You have to get out of here, or Chanti will come. He is here. They are a bit confused. You come out. Listen to me and shift him to some other place. If Chanti gets him you would also go to jail along with him. May I go now? - Where will you go? The real game will begin now. I was born with eagle eyes. I am like a satellite. I will find out wherever you hide. I will take him to the court, whoever comes in my path. And with that you will be confined to a jail forever. Come on! No one will escape. Now you take him along. He will tell the truth in the court. Judge. The one who planted a bomb... ...in Rama Krishna's building was I. I did it on Mr. Umapati's instructions. He will tell the truth there. Uma, if you stop it, I will start laughing. You don't have a chance to laugh. Then I will whistle. Does he have a camera shop? He is coming here with a brand new camera. Like a Spiderman and Superman, I am a Cameraman. Hey, I have recorded whatever you did. He has got a photogenic face. When an illiterate goon like you can be so smart, I am educated goon, how smart should I be? Oh God! He is coming again to get thrashed. Oh God! One wicket down. He is not match-fit anymore. Chanti. I wanted to quit the job when Mr. Purushottam died. I won't give you a chance to dismiss me. I will leave. Hey, you! You are trying to get smart with us? You are supporting the guy who exploded our building. How much did you take from him? I'll break your teeth if you say one more word about Mr. Chanti. Subramaniam! - Forgive me, sir. I couldn't bear it when they were talking ill of Mr. Chanti. When the building collapsed... ...thinking they might get arrested, they fled. But to save you... ...he lied that he planted a bomb... ...and got arrested, sir. Chanti! Your daughter's marriage that was cancelled... ...didn't happen because the groom's family came back. Swallowing his pride for his sister... ...your nephew went to them and touched their feet to make it happen. Because your son doubts his wife and torments her... ...for his brother's wife, swallowing his pride... ...he left home for a mistake he didn't commit. Your brother who treated you as God... ...didn't die because of his son. Because these gems' insulted him.... ....he got a heart attack and died. Don't believe him, father. He is lying. Shut up, you scoundrels! Still you want to fool me? I have only one son. Chanti. Hey, pour petrol on him. Chanti, along with you, your evidence will also be destroyed. Then your uncle... Just like your father... ...will die of a heart attack. The fire of my anger over 20 years... ...will be quenched with these flames. You dared to touch my son? All these days he toiled for me. Today I am ready to die for him. Come on! Hey! Burn Chanti right in front of him. Chanti. All these days I couldn't understand you. For us you did so much... How do I pay you back? Don't talk like that, uncle. Chanti. - Uncle. What's that dress! It doesn't match you at all. It matches me. I put a new dress for you in your room. Wear that one. A new dress? It should be bright. It should be like a dream. Or else... - I will turn into a nightmare for you. Ready. Smile please. - Stop. Sir, lot of people had cast evil eyes on your family. Let me ward off those evil eyes, sir. If it goes wrong you would die, Nani. I am doing this to make sure nothing goes wrong. Om! Nani, do it fast. There's a flower in it, sir. A flower. Ready. Don't blind. Smile please.
