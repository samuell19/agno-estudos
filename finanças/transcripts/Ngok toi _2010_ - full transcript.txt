I won't go in! I won't go in! No! No! The fetus is dead We haνe to take it out No! No! I won't go in! HeIp me! Move your foot! Don't block the door! i won't go in! Doctor please... Could you don't take it out? The fetus is dead. We have to take it out Please don't... Please go away Let me go! WiIl you? The last three reports are out. No match! No? Did we miss anyone? Probably not Αll the men are tested Should we test the women too? That's impossible I know. A woman can't be pregnant without a man Yet all the men eνer entered the premises... ...have already had their DNΑ tested Besides, that is a high security psychiatric hospital No ordinary people can get into it Yes Ok, I'll come and get it right now Miss T, the DNA of both fetuses are out i go get it now Αny problem? Don't know yet, I'm going to check it out The only possibility is that... someone stealthily brought in men from outside to rape the female patients Or a man disguised as a femaIe nurse Will that be possible? Does anyone have the calendar of last year? I do. What's up? I just wanna find out what's the date in 2009 for the 28th Day of the first month in Lunar calendar Lunar 28th of the first month? I was borne on Lunar 20th of the first month It was exactIy on February 14, the Valentine's day, last year So what? That's weird? What? Βefore the Iady was admitted to the psychiatric hospital She had miscarriage once Αccording to the record It was February 22 Lunar 28th of the first month Last Saturday, March 1 3 She had miscarriage again It was also the same Lunar 28th of the first month That's wicked! What about the time? The operation time wasn't the same But the time that they took out the dead fetus wasn't the time of the baby's death Such coincident! Miss T, there must be ghosts What? We compared both DNA of the fetuses The arrangement of their DNA is exactly the same Since the result is so weird The lab repeated the testing many times Yet the resuIt is 1 00% positive That means the same guy went into the hospital... and raped the female patient again? No, that not the case, Miss T This report shown that... both DNA arrangements of the dead fetuses are exactly the same Which means... both fetuses are the same person You've been pregnant for three months. Don't you know that? My menstrual period has never been punctual You had miscarriage twice, be carefuI this time I prescribe some medicine for you to prevent miscarriage Once daily before bed Don't worry, nothing reaIly bad Try not to reach up No smoking, no drinking Then everything should be fine Thank you doctor Get the prescription outside Winnie Shum...
