MY MASTERPIECE Buenos Aires is the best city in the world. But, strangely enough, it might also be the worst city ever. That contrast is what makes it irresistibly charming. Another highlight of Buenos Aires: Its people. I've travelled the world.. I'm really familiar with New York, London, Tokyo. But the ambition and madness of Buenos Aires is incredibly unique. Somebody said it's the capital city of an empire that never existed. It has something about the elegance of the European cities, but with the right amount of decay' which prevents it from that over sweet beauty of Paris. Buenos Aires is chaotic, unpredictable, cruel, contradictory. But these flaws are precisely what makes the city breathe. Anything can happen in Buenos Aires. Oops, sorry. I was dragged by the landscape. Truth is, I didn't mean to talk about Buenos Aires. I meant to introduce myself and tell you a secret story. My name is Arturo Silva, and I work in the art trading business. The secret... I'm a murderer.. The story begins and ends with a man. A great artist and a friend: Renzo Nervi.. FIVE YEARS BEFORE Renzo, it's not just that it didn't sell. The critics were devastating! Aranovich from the National News wonders why being fully in the XXI century I would insist on a past century artist. Are you calling to read out the comments of some stupid jerk from a newspaper? No, I'm calling because your exhibition will be over this week. You didn't give the press a single interview. You haven't shown up, not even to the opening. Renzo, people want to meet the artist. Some PR, man! Well, but the clown part is on you. The world has changed, Renzo. Have you noticed that from your sty? You have to update a bit. Revamp your style. Are you done, dude? And to top it all, you play hard to get! It's been over ten years since I last sold one of your fucking paintings! You owe me a lot of money! How the hell are you gonna pay me back? Sorry. 0k, ok, I'm sorry. Don't worry. I'll come up with something. That's it, Renzo. That's it. The work is amazing. Once again the irony, the sarcasm. - How much? - 10 thousand dollars. - What about this one? - The same. A critical eye at power... At frivolity. Well, it's your lucky day. Here comes the artist himself. Renzo Nervi. I'm going to introduce him to you. Renzo, I want you to meet... There you go. Very stylish. Now go sell it to some asshole interested in it... Should I call the police? Yes? - Renzo, right? - Yes. I'm Alex. How are you? Nice to meet you. - So? - I want to take art classes with you. - Who sent you? How did you get here? - I've been asking around. M -Who? - any people. All of them agreed that you are the last actual painter. You're a living legend. A living legend? I don't take in students anymore. They've warned you were difficult to deal with, and very demanding. But, please, give me a chance. Try me. Admissions are closed. Sir, I'd like to be your disciple. I'm sorry, I'm a bit stubborn. Ah, so you are stubborn. Fine. Come in. - You are from Spain, clearly. - Yes, sir, from Madrid. I've brought you some of my drawings. What are you doing here, when you could live in a rather civilized country instead? Don't say that. I've been travelling around for the last six months. I've been in Colombia, Peru, Bolivia, now Argentina. The liveliness down here is really... - Depressing. - Depressing... I want to know first-hand the reality of the emerging countries. Emerging? I call them "countries with limited capabilities". However, to me Argentina is fascinating. So many contrasts. Contrasts? OK, good. Let's start. Let's make it clear: This is just a trial period. Then we'll see whether you'll leave or stay. - Follow me. - Yes. First class. You're going to examine with extreme care all the objects in this room, everything. The lamp, the kayak, the Bambies, the sewing machine. Every single thing. But do not touch anything. Just observe, ok? - But what's the idea? - None of your business. - In time, you'll see. - But what should I see? The first thing you've got to do is to sit down and observe down to the last detail all the objects in this room. I think two hours will be enough. Ah, she is Laura, a student too. - What's your name? - Alex. Alex is a new student. He started today, but he's in his trial period. - I see. I'm leaving for college. - Ok. Oh, I forgot to tell you. The landlord called yesterday. He said you owe him eight months of rent. - If you don't pay him off this week... - Yes. Tell that motherfucking exploiter that if he has something to tell me he can come, ring my bell and talk straight into my face, if he dares. You'd better tell him that yourself. - Bye. - Bye. Sit down. - Very pretty girlfriend, teacher. - Sit down. Arturo... It's Renzo. He won't talk to me, just with you. - Did you tell him I'm in? - Yes. - Eugenia, c'mon! - I'm sorry. - Hello. Did you sell the paintings I shot? If not, you are a bad seller. I did what you asked for, I updated them. Look. I'm not interested in talking to you. Just for your information: piercing the works of art has been done tons of times. You don't get it, do you? On top of being violent, you are a total ignorant. I know, I know. Sorry. I'm just kidding. I got out of control. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Kit's a good thing to admit it.. We are packing up all your paintings. Eugenia was calling you to deliver them right away, along with the bill for what you've destroyed at the gallery. No, not to my house, there's no room, this house is a big mess, no way. I fulfill my obligation to have them delivered. You do what you want. I don't know, make a barbecue with them or throw them away. This is not a dump site, Renzo. Go fuck yourself. Garbage! What the... What are you doing here? What do you want? I've been observing for almost three hours. Assignment number two. I want you to remove every single piece that's here, the trashy things, the crappy things, everything. You're going to put it over there. Absolutely nothing stays here. Nothing. - But what for? - You're gonna find out later. Nothing should be left, not even a slip of paper. Got it? See you. - After the plaster, will you paint? - Yes, madam. - Can you pack that one, please? - Sure. Send him everything at once. I'm not coming back. I've told Mr. Larsen about your idea of acquiring a piece of art to contribute to the company heritage. We've thought it might be interesting to get a historic piece to exhibit it at the main hall of our headquarters. Let me suggest you the following: instead of acquiring a historic piece, why don't you have an original piece of art especially painted for you? You could summon a great artist, ask him to create a work of art for this purpose. The painting might even refer to the company in some way or other... - Sounds good. - Of course, the investment will be larger, but it's something else. It's an original work. Made-to-order. And who could be that artist? There are several outstanding plastic artists. Give me a few days, and I'll contact you back with a proposal... Hi. - Hi, hi... - Stop, what are you doing? - What? - The kid is still there. - So what? Let's see the pictures. Look. - 80? - Yes. Say something to me. - What? - What do you think about them? You are so beautiful. Youth is so beautiful. But then everything gets screwed up. - C'mon, stop, seriously. - What? - Tell me what you think. - Let's see. I take them myself. They're cute. - Cute? - Yes. That's all you have to say? I'm not an art critic, nor do I want to be one. I can't say what's good or bad. I don't even know why I paint. Talking about yourself back again. No, it's not that. I can't state "this is artistic or not..." - Don't be mean. - You know what's the problem? We've been together for months and you don't have the slightest idea of what I do or think, you've never seen me. - It's not like that. - Yes! You're a self centered bastard! - Don't say that, be nice. - Yes, you're very selfish, you know? - C'mon... - I don't wanna see you anymore! Listen to me! Go, then! Renzo Nervi? Don't you have anyone else for such an assignment? I don't know, someone younger, less problematic. More civilized, so to say. I called Desagastizébal, but he's in Spain. And honestly, a skilled painter who can make a forceful oil painting on a big surface, I don't know any other, unfortunately. Besides, he never complains about the fees, percentages... That is not a minor topic. I'd like to help him. He's flat broke. I don't like him at all. He's always flirting with me on the phone, uses dirty words. - He's disgusting. - Well, well, well. It's amazing to see you painting. What is it? Are you done? - Spotless. - Thanks. - It wasn't easy, but it's over. - No, it isn't over. Now comes the most important part. Do you remember the first step? The observation thing? Good, now you're going to bring back everything and put every object in their original position. This is a memory exercise, that's why you were observing for so many hours as I asked you to do. Take all the time you need to do it consciously. You have at least a full week ahead. So start. Let's see. Alex, boy! Come here. Read this for me, my dear. Let's see what it says. "This is a notice of demand, 24 hours upon notice, to vacate the property located on 1671 Pedro de Mendoza St. In the city of Buenos Aires under penalty of damage and other legal actions..." - Ok, perfect, great. Thank you. - But... Nothing. A Chinese wise man said: "Do not speak unless if you can improve silence." Go work. Words of a living legend. Thanks. Son of a... Look. Here they are. Hey, what's up? We've been waiting for you upstairs, why didn't you come up? Finally a decent exhibit in your gallery, very good, congratulations. - Well, thank you very much. - Contemporary art. Who's the genius? He's a young Argentinean artist. Lives in Berlin, I've already sold five of his paintings. A piece of shit. This piece of shit is sold. You don't get it, talking to you is useless. The work of this guy is amazing. Forget about it. Now, listen to me. Listen, I made a draft of the work for these guys and told them it was you. I had to show something. You did the draft yourself? Yes, just a sketch, no more. And they loved it. Doing it will be a piece of cake to you. I didn't know you could paint. Don't play the fool and pay attention to me. The old guy's name is Alberto Larsen. He's the company's owner. The guy beside him is a sort of professional sycophant in charge of family investments. Now we go in together, you play the role you like, the introvert artist who doesn't speak, and I handle the situation, ok? - Arturo... - Hi, beautiful! What you're promoting as new stuff is really old. Duchamp did that more than 100 years ago. You are more beautiful than ever. The good thing is that, despite his very busy schedule, Renzo was interested in this particular project. Renzo, Mr. Larsen and his family liked your draft very much. That's good. Can I see it? My little granddaughter liked it a lot. Good for her. Renzo, please tell us, how did the idea for this work come to you? Fm... You go.. The artist just talks through his work. I will tell you the story. Renzo appeals to the history of the company, from the arrival of this visionary family from Norway, until it finally becomes the huge company it is today. Excellent. It's meant to be a masterpiece in the style of the great Mexican muralists, but contemporary. A work customized so as to fit Larsen company reputation, and that will also match your needs for its exhibition in the entrance hall of the building. - It's 2 by 1, right? - Yes, exactly. Perfect, then. He's very enthusiastic. Ready. Perfect. Look at this. I would certainly buy this portrait. 80 buy it. Check how much you've got in your pocket, maybe you can afford it. Let's go back to reality. Come, sit down. The meeting with the Larsens was fine, don't you think? - The work has to be ready... - I'm really sorry, but quite frankly, I'm not sure if I can make it, I've never done a made-to-order painting before... This could be done by any asshole art student... Since you have more than enough money... It's not that. I have a hard time painting for a family of motherfucking exploiters as if they were heroes. Complicated. Of course. You are an independent artist. Exactly. Picasso was independent, because he did whatever he wanted. He worked on demand as well, you know... And he was a millionaire. There is no contradiction in that... Why in the world are you so prejudiced? I'm not asking you to work for Hitler. These are some Scandinavians who sought the end of the world to make money as everybody else did in those days. In those and in all days... screwing people. You're tiresome. Don't come to me with that trashy speech. I just can't work like that, Arturo, you've got to understand me. You've got no choice. Whenever I mention your name, there's always someone asking: "Renzo Nervi? I thought he was dead." - Maybe they're right. - You're going to do it. Repeat with me: "Even though I am a resentful artist and an old asshole, I will work on this painting anyway". Cut the bullshit. Take the draft home, improve it. It should be ready in two weeks time, on the company anniversary and I've committed to deliver it. Two weeks? No way. I can't make it. You will make it, otherwise I'll take the delivery truck in two weeks and take the work as it is. Whatever you do will be good for them. Besides, it'll be exhibited inside the company's building. Only they will see it. Enough. There you go. Aranovich is here, visiting the exhibition. - Aranovich? - The critic? - Yes. - I'd love to say hello. - It's not necessary. - Yes, why not? - Hi, Mauricio. - Arturo. - How are you doing? - Very good. Excuse me, I wanted to make a comment about the review that you wrote on my latest exhibition. Look, Nervi, I'm not used to debating my reviews... If you felt humiliated, write a complain letter to the newspaper. No, please, Aranovich, you are free to say what you want. Obviously. And despite the fact that you've been even aggressive towards my work, we always end up learning through your ideas. That's how it goes. He who know, knows. Well, thank you. I apologize, I've got to leave. - Ok, good. - Yes. This guy is very good. The way he re-signifies daily objects from the sports universe. Lustful... - Congratulations. - Thank you. He's very talented, this young man. - Good. I'll get going. - Bye, Mauricio. And thank you for taking the time to analyze my work and being there. - Thank you. - No, please. - My pleasure. - I've got to go, ok? Take your hand off me. Thank you, thank you. - Enough. - Thank you. - Brute! Human rat! - Stop it, Renzo. I'm sorry, I strongly apologize. You too, get out. - Renzo's not doing good. - I don't forgive you, or him. You are a decaying gallery owner, and he's a beastly second rate jerk. Oh, yes? Wash your mouth before talking about an artist like Renzo Nervi, you're nothing compared to him. Yes. You're not welcome here anymore, Aranovich. You're not welcome anymore! Thank you. Pk. Let's start.. Notary. Stingy. Sales insurance. Affectionate... Taxi driver. High cholesterol... Let's see... Marketing assistant. Deppresive. Students from the province. Pumkin pie. Bartender. Owns an old Volvo, one of the squared ones. KPeronist sociologist.. Dermatologist. Collects wooden ducks. Soccer players' manager. He listens to Supertramp. Yes, Eugenia, tell me. Arturo, Ms. Figueroa called. She's finally made up her mind and wants to buy Nervi's nude. That old work, remember? Ah, yes, the naked woman. She says she can't afford 5 thousand but can pay 35 hundred dollars, cash. What a stingy old bag... She must spend that much on a dinner. Ok, say yes, it's ok. Remember your painting of the naked woman? Yes. Well, good news. I've sold it to a client, I came to pick it up and take it to her. 35 hundred dollars, we split it in half. - I don't have it. - What do you mean you don't have it? - No. Laura has it. - What? You gave it to her? - I can't believe it. - Don't get started, take it easy. I can call her and switch it for another painting, no problem. - Are you sure? - Sure. C'mon. Good. Here. There you go. There you go. - Renzo. - What? Thanks. Hi, it's Laura, leave your message. Hi, Laurita, what's up? C'mon, stop it... You haven't been answering my calls for a long time. Have you shot new pictures? I'd love to see them. C'mon... Talk to me. It wasn't such a big deal. Kisses. C'mon, c'mon. - You're certain she's at college right now? - Yes. Look, there it is! And she didn't hang it. - Okay, let's just take it. - Yeah. - No, stop it... - What? Are you ticklish? Will you lock up? Do you have the keys? - Fuck! Who are you? - Relax kid, relax. I'm Laura's father. - Oh. - Where's Laura? She went to class. Listen. I'm very worried about her. - Come out, come out please. - What? - What...? - He's my... Jerénimo. I'm the doctor's partner and I love Laura like a daughter. - Right... - This should stay between us. - Yes. - Please don't tell her anything. - Grab the painting, won't you? - Don't worry. OK. We have to go now. Bye bye! Bye. - Bye dear, bye. - Nice meeting you. How bizarre. A bit. It's good. - Very good. Excellent. - Thank you. Well, what's next? I hope it's something more art related. No next. We are done. - Did I do something wrong? - No. On the contrary. You did very well. - So? - So that means you're saved. You're not going to be an artist. How come? You've proved to be hard working, methodic, consistent, and above everything else, modest, and those attributes won't help you become an artist. To be a successful artist, you need to be ambitious and selfish. Whoever makes art, it's because they can't do anything else, it's a kind of disability. You, instead, can aspire to do something that's actually useful to other people. But, you are an artist. I'm a perfect example of what I've just told you. I do something that's absolutely useless, which doesn't appeal anyone no more. But I want to paint, because I have this need to express myself, to say what I've got to say. No, you don't have to "say", you've got to "do". One is what one does. Not what one says. Just listen to me, dude. Get out of here. I know you'll hate me, but in a while you'll thank me. But, master... What I need is to get paid right now if you please. - It's 25 hundred pesos. - What do you mean 25 hundred? - You said 500. - Prices increase. Increase... I don't have the money here. I should gather... I might bring it... - I don't know, I can... - As soon as possible, please. You don't even have to ring the bell, you can slide the money under the doorway, ok? Bring the money, 0k? That's good, it's ok. So? Very good. You work so well under pressure. In that sense, you are a normal person, see? Larsen will love it. Yes, it's good. More or less. The little granddaughter has to like it. True, the little granddaughter. The van will pick it up tomorrow, the company's event is at noon, 0k? Great. That'll give me time to give it some final strokes. What? What strokes? It's perfect, don't touch it. No, yes, I like to give it a last touch, with my hand, you see? The work itself will tell you when it's done. Don't give me that speech, save it for your students. I need an advance payment. - Huh? - I need money, a few bucks to buy fuel to work at night. Listen to me. The truck comes at 9 tomorrow morning. - Yes. There you go, thanks. - Have it ready and packed, 0k? - Yes, perfect. - It's good, so good. C'mon, c'mon. Slowly. Watch the step. Watch out. There you go. Thank you. Good. Thank you, good. Good. Just on time. I appeal for a round of applause for the author, artist Renzo Nervi. Unfortunately, he couldn't make it for personal reasons. But in his place is his art agent, Mr. Arturo Silva, who was the main promoter for this project. - Arturo, please. - Thank you so much. Just as in the Renaissance the artists created their works thanks to the patrons that supported them, today, Larsen family's business takes on this noble tradition entrusting Renzo Nervi, one of the most renowned plastic artists in Argentina, to perform this masterpiece, celebrating and paying tribute to one of the families that have helped forge the greatness of our country. Mr. Larsen, please, and your granddaughter. Azul, right? Come, sweetie. Let's go. Let's go. No! Since it's the fourth time I call and you're not answering, there I go: Fucking drunk, ' your credit's over. It's over. You've just spoilt the only thing you had left, which was me. Your wild side took over and you became the resentful old guy you are. FD you can go fuck yourself' and I hope I don't ever see you again in this fucking lifetime! I was just kidding, you guys! Kid, can you look at my pets for a bit? I'll go eat something and be right back. Thanks. Oh, so good. Come here. - Sir? - Everything was pretty good. - Thank you very much. - But, for you information, don't bring the bill because I won't pay it. - Excuse me? - You heard me. I won't pay. And do bring me another glass of this Italian grappa, it's really good. C'mon, C'mon, go, go, c'mon. Gentleman, here's your bill. I just told the waiter that I won't pay it. Gentleman, don't force us to call the police. This dinner represents a tiny payback for all I've contributed to this fucking society as an artist along fifty years... I've made my decision. And you should be happy. - My presence here has improved the average category... - Please. - Of your clients, all crooked and ordinary. - Please. Don't forget to bring me my grappa now and I'll take my leave. Thanks, thanks. What do we do? Bring him his grappa so he gets the hell out. Are you ok, sir? Better than you in that shirt. Don't you see I'm crossing the street, asshole? What? Fuck you! Hello. Hello. Hello! Can you hear me? The doctor said you can't remember anything. Do you know who I am? You were run over by a truck a few days ago. They took you to a public hospital and I brought you to this clinic. You'd deserve to be left to die alone and abandoned but you were lucky. I don't want to carry that burden, so once again, here I am. You've got three broken ribs, a smashed knee, blunt trauma in head and legs. You were taken to the ICU. Now you are stable, but amnesic. The doctor asked me to help you rebuild your past, so that you can exercise your mind. OK? Yes? Let's start from the beginning. Your name is Renzo Nervi. You are a painter. I am Arturo Silva and I've been your art agent for a thousand years. Hi, how's everything going? This is a prehistoric picture: 1975. That's you and me. We've been friends for over forty years, Renzo. Here we are on holidays. I was with Inés, I had just met her. And you were with your girl of the moment, I think Beatriz was her name. Remember anything? Look. My old gallery in Juncal St. That's you. Do you recognize yourself? It's ok, it's ok, leave it. This is your work. From the 80's. Right... - And did it sell? - Yes, of course. - Yes? - Yes, on that decade you were trending. I'm gonna leave you this book, it has many more for you to see. Very powerful work, pop art. We made lots of money. You were sought after from much larger galleries, with incredibly attractive money offers, exhibitions abroad... But you always said no. You put our friendship first, before your personal benefit. That's something I could never forget. A beautiful era. We had so much fun. We sold everything you did. Everything. - And now? - Now, we don't. Look, pay attention. Look at this woman. The one in black. Do you recognize her? No. - Do you find her attractive? - No. She was your wife for twenty years. Raquel. She passed away a while ago. The poor thing. You were involved with a Polish woman for quite a while too. - How was the Polish one? - A disaster. - Don't say. - Yes. You've always had a strong stomach. Here I am with Inés, on a vacation. Look, here, with my son Agustin. He was around five then, he's a man now. He's thirty, lives in the USA, is an engineer. - Tell me, are you still with... - Inés? No. - No, we separated a while ago. - What a pity. Oh, well. Wait, I wanna show you... There it is. This is Agustin today. Look at him. You have a son too. His name is Pablo. You saw him when he was born, you stayed a few days, and then ran away. I think the mother's name was Esther, it was just a fling. Wait, I got some Facebook pics. There it is, look. He's a big guy now, see? The fat one with the Van Dyke beard. This would be your wife, and the little fat ones, your grandchildren. If you hadn't ran away, this'd be your family now. Oh yes... Look what I brought you. I couldn't afford the million bucks painting that you liked, but I brought you the catalog of his last exhibition. Oh, thank you. A cell phone so we can be connected. And the glasses you asked for. It was one thing after the other. The last period was tough... We were not selling anything at all. But why? I don't know. To me you are still a great painter. But fashion trends change. It all started going in a different direction and you stayed behind. And then, Renzo, you became really stubborn, antisocial. "Everyone's an asshole, and they don't realize how great I am." So imagine. And when you had a made-to-order assignment, that would've helped you get back on your feet, you screwed it all up... as a resentful drunk scumbag... This is my friend. Go on, go on. - You were thrown out of the pigsty you were renting. - Really? Your stuff was seized as a preventive measure. Even your works are held as deposit in court. - I should've died for good. - Well, that would've been ideal. Nothing sensible can ever happen to you. You're not dead... Instead, here you are, a decrepit old man... torn to pieces and amnesiac. - The outlook is... - Holy Mother. Be careful, you guys, 0k? They're done bringing down Nervi's works. They are a lot. Good. We've got to separate... the paintings that are well preserved from the ones that need to be restored. Unfinished work and sketches, to the side. And you, take pictures of everything. Let's go. Do we start with all these ones? Then, we can bring the ones from there. I see, I see... What do you see? Athing... What color is it? Black! Like your big mamma's ass! Fuck you! Get out of here with that fucking nose, I don't want to see you again! Well, that's improvement. Which improvement? Holy shit... - Hi, Laurita. - Hi Arturo, how are you? - Thanks for coming. - Santi, my boyfriend. Arturo. - How are you, Santi? - Hello, how are you? I owe you an apology, but you know Renzo. - Don't worry, it's all good. - Ok. He is devoted to you, that's why I called you. - I get it, seriously, it's all good. - Thanks a lot. As I told you, Renzo almost died. He's a little better now, but really depressed. Don't be shocked when you see him. Try to smile, cheer him up. I hope he knows who you are. He's over there, room 303. - Thanks. - Let's go. No, dude, stay with me. C'mon, stay here. Hi. Do you recognize me? Do you know who I am? Laura! How are you, Laurita? Good, and you? You disgusting old man, fucking misogynist, it's good to see you flat on your back! Now you won't spy on me anymore. Anyway I warn you I've already bought a new lock. I wish you go rotten, now I'm with a real man who fucks me real good, not like you, old soft dick asshole! Thanks for everything. Thanks so much, Laurita. I'm sure it was good for him to see you. Thank you very much. It's over. Very interesting. I can't... I don't see much... compatibility with my gallery. It's not what I usually... Let's see, wait a sec... Eugenia, I've got to go to the clinic. Please, try to send this artist to a more underground place, more aligned with his style. I leave you in good hands. - Thank you. - My pleasure. Did you watch a lot of TV? Till very late, grandpa? This grandpa is a little deaf. Do you know if he moved his bowels? I wouldn't know. Renzo? The thing with old people is they dehydrate too easily. He's got to drink a lot of water. Did you hear, grandpa? A lot of water, ok? See you tomorrow, God willing. See you tomorrow, nurse. Arturo. Everything ok? Not good. Bad. I wanna put an end to all of this. Why do you say that? You're doing so much better. You started to recover. Now you gotta get out of the hospital, life goes on in the city. A city full of shitty people, with shitty little jobs, inside their shitty houses. Oh, that's so deep and heartbreaking! I'm sure you must have told me an improved version of my life. But you know what? It looks pathetic to me anyway. From that perspective, any life is stupid and pointless. - Mine, yours... - I'll say this only once. I'd rather die than to continue living like this. Do you want to help me? Yes. You know what you've gotta do. Now grandpa is going to sleep. Bye. What you tell me is terrible... I thought he had long been dead. It's a very hard situation. He's recovering his memory only now. He's penniless. I'm helping him as much as I can. - Very hard. - Mhmm. He has nothing but his works... which, honestly, are rather devaluated. Like he's nobody these days. Mind you, his paintings are really good. But if he can't make it out of this situation... well, poor guy... You know what I mean. If he dies, - prices will rise like crazy. - They might... or not. I have all his paintings in my gallery, all of it. About two hundred paintings. The work of a lifetime. What I'm specifically offering you, Dudu, is that you keep half of his work. One hundred. What figure are you thinking of? One million dollars. Just think. Ten thousand apiece. You know that Nervi's paintings don't fall below fifteen, twenty thousand dollars. I don't think you're selling now this guy's work at 20 thousand, honestly. And truth is, he's not an artist I'm particularly interested in. And I have my doubts that in the future he'll be more in demand. - Nine hundred thousand? - Arturo, please don't bargain with me. I've never mentioned it was too much for me, I simply said I was not interested in that artist. If we purchase all the pieces at three hundred thousand dollars, that would make 15 hundred per each... No way... it's too scarce. He has no idea about money. To him that's quite a fortune... You can pay whatever you want. That's exactly why my responsibility is even bigger. I don't want to screw Renzo, he's my friend. I want to pay him a fair price. At 25 hundred each, how much is it? It'd be five hundred thousand. No, it's too much. I can't afford it. - Good morning. - Hi. I was thinking... How are my pets? - We had to sacrifice them, of course. - What? No, I'm just kidding... Your filthy 200 is sound and safe. Cats, dogs, birds. What are we gonna do about the expenses of the shelter? It's a lot of money. I'm gonna ask you to leave everything as it is, and what's more, I'm gonna ask you - to be in charge if I'm not around, get it? - Ok. Well then, let's talk about money. But pay attention, please. Besides your animals' shelter, you know I'm covering the expenses of the clinic, which are very expensive. But it's not just that. I rescued your work, which were held at the deposit in court, and I paid off your rent debt, to avoid a nasty trial. How would you want me to pay you back? - Keep my works. - Your work is safe at the gallery. You can't imagine the pigsty where it was all stored. Rats, leaks. Disgusting. We're now labeling and documenting every item. You have approximately two hundred paintings. Making a huge effort, Renzo, I can buy your entire work at three hundred thousand dollars. That'd be 15 hundred dollars apiece. I don't care about the money. I remember everything. I know you've been the most loyal of friends throughout my whole life. I just needed you to know how thankful I am. Thank you. Tomorrow you'll have to sign a lot of paperwork, the authenticity certificates... Otherwise I can't sell your paintings to anyone. Ok? - Yes, my dear. - Ok, let's stop the talking. - Get out of here! Get out! - Sorry... Sign here. Very good. Here. Yes? I'm Alex. I used to be Renzo's art student for a while. - Yes? - Yes. Come in, please. How do you do, kid? - How are you? - How are you doing? I came to keep up with my word. I brought the 25 hundred pesos. You didn't have to. I went to your home and learned you didn't live there any longer. And then I recalled the legal notice, found out about the accident, and I've been looking for you for weeks. You know I'm a little stubborn. You don't owe me anything. I do. And most importantly, I wanted to thank you for your advice. At that moment I felt frustrated, but in time I saw your point, and now I can realize how important meeting you was to me. Even if you refuse, I regard you as my master. Oh come on... I'm no master. Please take the money for your lessons. No, please, keep it, please. No, seriously. What I've learned with you is invaluable. Why don't you help somebody else with that money? Renzo is now very well taken of. He doesn't need anything. I'm sorry, I insist. I won't leave till I pay my debt. Ok, Renzo, take it. Ok. Just leave it somewhere. What are those papers you were signing? He is Arturo, my art agent and friend. He takes my work, which is worthless, as payment for all of this. Is he paying for your medical bills? - Sure. - Would you like to share the expenses, kid? No, no. You can't imagine how expensive it is to have an accident... I wouldn't advise it. So, do you still want to become an artist? No, no. I'm working as a volunteer in an NGO that's sponsored by the Dutch government. - Oh, yes? - Yes. We're like a rescue squad, assisting the homeless, we tidy them up, feed them... We've saved lives. I think this is my true vocation: community service. And I found out thanks to you, master. No talking but doing: just what you told me once. It stuck in my mind, and I... - You're a little tired, Renzo. - A little, yes. Your master wants to sleep now. Besides, the visiting hours are over. Of course. Here is my personal card. You can call me anytime. You know I'm your loyal disciple. Thank you. Bye, my dear. When are you going back home, master? I don't think he will, it's not his home anymore. - Please... - Ok. - See you. - Arturo. Bye, kid. - Master. - Bye, kid. Oh, that's good, the way he... - He's a good kid. - Well, well, too much. SOLIDARIZ-ARTE The art of giving Arturo! I can't go on. - Hello? - Arturo Silva? Yes, it's me. I'm calling from the clinic, regarding patient Nervi. Did anything happen? There he is. He disconnected himself last night. He got out of his bed and went to the nurses' office where he took everything he found there. - He was found unconscious. - Fuck! He's stable now, and recovering. He won't be in his room till tomorrow. I'll be in the nursing room if you need me. Yes, thanks. THE END - Come. - Yes. - Can we talk someplace else? - Yes, sure. I wanted to thank you for everything you've done for him... Please, it's my job. Still, what you did means a lot to me. This is for you. Thanks a lot. You don't need to, though. You deserve it. Also, I want to... I need you to do me an important favor... I guess this is not the first time you're asked such thing, but... I need you to provide me with a substance, a drug, so that if things don't improve I can give an end to my friend's pain. Something that can't be traced. What happened was clearly a suicide attempt, and I think Renzo has all the right in the world to decide if he wants to keep on living or not. It kills me to see him like that. A guy full of vitality who... It's just in case. It doesn't mean I'm gonna use it. Dissolve it in any drink. The effect is immediate and undetectable. - This meeting never happened. - Obviously. Thank you so much. - Good luck. - Thank you. Seriously. If you're watching this, it means that I... I'm dead. I was born in year 332 after Rembrandt, I start my count with Rembrandt, who was a genius. Not after Christ, who was a lunatic. What do you work for? To purchase stuff? To go on holidays? Slavery never came to an end. Now it's called "work".. And studies, college... All useless. Ignorant or cultivated, twice ignorant. This place has no way out, When a whole country sits their ass in front of a TV, ' to watch 22 millionaires running after a ball, there's no hope. Ideologies don't exist anymore. Man exists.. An actual man, who behaves this or that way. Man doesn't come from the ape. Man is an ape. An ape standing on its feet who sits down to shit. And now, the most important thing of all. I'm such a pessimist that I'm optimistic. Because the extremes meet.. And the cold bums.. Fuck you all! Good bye.. Before taking the floor, I wanted to show you this video of Renzo. I found this posthumous message in his phone, among his belongings, and it's bone-crashing. Mr. Minister, Director of the Museum of Fine Arts, general audience. Thank you so much for coming to the posthumous exhibition of this great artist who passed away almost two months ago. I will al... I will always feel the absence of Renzo as a dagger in my heart... He was always true to himself. He would not follow market ups and downs or pressure from anybody. I witnessed his dignity and his integrity, even in the toughest of times. But he could never really get back on his feet after that accident. He has left us with an overwhelming legacy. But I will still miss him as the great friend he was. Enjoy the exhibition. Arturo... There's a kid who wants to see you. Alex, from "SOLIDARIZ-ARTE". Gosh, he's boring... Tell him I'm in a meeting, and I'm leaving in a trip tomorrow, or have him write an email if he needs anything. - Ok. - Mr. Silva. How are you? It's just a minute. Look, I travel tomorrow and I'm very busy. Just a couple questions, that's it. - Ok. Go, Eugenia, go. Come in. - Excuse me. - All good? - Yes. I'm glad. Just a little thing, out of curiosity. Where do the profits for the sales of Renzo's works go? Did he have heirs? Because I've been asking and one of his works is not below thirty thousand dollars. Honestly, I don't know why I should be answering this kind of questions, but for your information, let me tell you that all of Renzo's work belongs to me. I legally bought it from him. I see. And now that he is dead, where is that money you paid him for his work? I understand he used most of it to afford his medical expenses... You visited him there. And the rest? I have no idea. I don't know if you're satisfied with the answer, or do you want me to add anything? No, no. It's just that you took him out of the hospital, which means that he was doing better, right? And all of a sudden, he dies. That's how it was. True, everything was fast, and really sad. Anyway, I have to be honest. Your questions and suspicions... I find them completely out of place. Renzo was like a brother to me. I've always supported him, not just from a financial but from a human viewpoint. And it makes me pretty mad that a fellow that met him for five minutes crosses the line as you are doing. You are being very disrespectful of Renzo's memory. And you are offending me. So leave right now because I swear I'll call the police. - Get off! - So I will. But this is far too shady. Too shady... How poetic! Get out of here. Shadows! Arturo! Thanks for coming. Now things are different. The pf lees of News works have rocketed after his death. There's a big demand... Blah, blah, blah, Arturo, don't use that argument with me. I know this business better than you do. But I'm selling a lot, seriously. That's why I asked you to come. You're selling at domestic prices. I'm proposing to make a leap, create demand abroad. Besides, if you keep selling so well, you'll be left with nothing when the prices go up... That's not a problem. There's plenty of paintings. Back then, when you came to see me, I couldn't see the business. Now that the guy died, everything is on your side. C'mon. Arturo, you know that I play in a different league. We have branches in Shanghai, New York, Sao Paulo. It's a different sales range, my dear. I know. I could pull open some strings to hold exhibitions of Nervi at the most renowned museums of the world. [OK, DudL]. - Now let's talk about figures. - Better. What's your proposal, exactly? Simple. I'll give you two million dollars, and it'll be 50-50 partnership on all future sales of Nervi's works... That is, I'll double what you had once offered me. Did you say sixty for me, and forty for you? No, you got it wrong, Arturo... I can grant annual sales at least five times higher than yours, or more... You know that. Fifty five for me, forty five for you, I stand my ground. Renzo has no ceiling, Dudu. OK, it's a deal. We'll do the paperwork later. What do you think if, as a first step, we organize an exhibition in some museum abroad? I love it. ONE YEAR LATER Hi, Dudu, where are you? Ok, I'm coming in. We meet at the hall directly. Last month, one of Nervi's paintings was sold at an auction for 140 thousand dollars... and that was no exception. One hundred forty three, more precisely. He says that no doubt it's worth it. Thank you. Please... This is my favorite painting. It's from the 803, the prime time of Nervi... It's a really extraordinary painting... How much do you want for the work? This one, or which one, exactly? All of them. The entire collection. Does he mean all the works exhibited here? Correct, sir. The point is, we don't have so many of these large-scale works... It's a limited number. We can't possibly get rid of all of them. The sheik says he's interested in all the exhibition such as it is displayed here for his palace. How much do you want for everything such as it is? Tell him we're thankful for his interest but... not all the entire exhibition is not in sale. I want to talk to you. Give us a second, please. Just a second and we'll be right back. Excuse us. Excuse us. What is it? Sell the whole thing... It's an amazing load of money. No, Arturo. No. We can't sell them all, it's insane, we need some backup for the future. The prices are escalating unendlessly. - I don't think it's smart to sell it off. - I've got more. Besides, this guy brings the whole work to his palace, just to be enjoyed by him and his harem, and the paintings will be put off stage. No. We need them moving around, being exhibited in museums, auctions... - Dudu, I've got more. Many more. - What? More of Renzo's work appeared at his aunt's house where he lived for ten years in the eighties. - At an aunt's house. - Yes. - Why hadn't you told me about it? - I'll explain it to you later... There's a stock of 90 paintings at least... or more... from the eighties. So sell everything and we'll restock later. C'mon, c'mon. - You are a piece of shit. - No! - Yes, you are a piece of shit. - It's not what you think. Very well. Tell him that if the offer is very generous, we would be willing to assess the possibility of selling the entire exhibition. He says that the proposal will be more than generous. The sheik would like to invite you to join him for dinner to close the deal. Thank you very much. The China exhibition was outstanding. We're slowly gaining over that market thanks to Dudu's contacts... Just think that in a really short time we had individuals in Rio de Janeiro, Boston, Rome, Paris, Peking, Frankfurt. We are doing really well in sales. The prices keep going up, but... We need more works from the eighties. The demand is high. I'll make you all the paintings from the 80's that you wish... Sell those and I'll make up for them. This one's ready. Let's see. Excellent. It's a pity that you were famous after your death, like Van Gogh... Did you see? Nineteen eighty... What do you say? Make it eighty four. There. She's the girl that brings the fresh veggies. She's really cute, you'll see... Carrots... Anything else? Yes, two red peppers. A motorcycle is approaching. What? - Where? - There. Let me see. Yes? Who is it? Alex! What are you doing here, kid? I can't believe it. Look at you... What are you doing? What do you want to do? Take a picture? Wait, stop, did you come alone? Unbelievable. No, kid. Leave that thing alone. Stop recording. - Stop. Turn that off. - Wait. - Listen to me. - Stop recording, leave that! I'm telling you to stop that! Stop shooting! - Give me my fucking phone. - Let me explain! There's nothing to explain! Give me my phone! Please, calm down! Listen to me. Come on inside. This is my house. Let's talk like civilized people. Listen to your master. Go in the house. It's all good, Alex. Go. - Come. - Go. It's all good. - Come, dear, come. - Go, go. You've cheated on everybody. What you did is very irregular, very wrong. I'm sorry but I have no choice other than reporting you on my return to Buenos Aires. No, no. C'mon. Think. Think for a second. It was the best way to help him, and I think I wasn't mistaken. Look at Renzo. He's doing best than ever. - But it's a fraud. - Art is a fraud. Nobody gets harmed. I can do what I love and needn't be an ass-kisser either. But you're damaging people who purchase your works in good faith. No. The people who purchase Renzo's works are actually buying Renzo's original work. Yes. It's mine. Let's be straightforward. - What do you want? - What? You followed me all the way here, you drove 1,700 km from Buenos Aires, found the whole thing out, so... Congrats, you won! How much do you want? - Are you trying to bribe me? - Yes, I'm bribing you. No, I haven't come all the way here to blackmail you. You can have five percent, Alex. - Are you serious? - Ten percent, last call. But, who do you think I am? You offend me. I wanted to know the truth, and now I know it. I'm really happy that you're alive and doing fine, Renzo, - but I'm going back to Buenos Aires. - Stay for lunch, at least. I prepared llama stew. And then you leave. You have many driving hours ahead and there's nothing on the way. See, Alex? You thought I was a murderer, now I've proved what kind of person I am and what kind of a friend I am. You're right, and I apologize. But what you've done is a scam, no doubt. And what is that to you? Not to me. It's the fact that it's wrong and I don't want to be an accomplice. So don't. Just drop it and that's it. Can I have my phone back, please? You don't eat with your phone on the table. Besides, there's no service here, no internet, nothing. Well, but tell us something about your life, Alex. What are your plans? Are you gonna take a few days off here in Jujuy? No. I just came here following him. Nobody knows I left. I have to go back to Buenos Aires, because I have a lot of work at the NGO. I'm general coordinator already. So you've been promoted. We're organizing some bartering events so we can raise funds for the qom tribe. We're exchanging qom handicrafts for money and food for them. We can collaborate with this NGO. - We can donate money. - Sure. It'd be dirty money. To me, moral values come first. And I learned that from you, Renzo. - From whom? - From me? Well... So, how was the stew? Very good. Now, let me confess, my next step will be to stop eating animals. - Oh, I see. - Good for you. Well, I should be leaving. I don't want to ride through the mountains in the night. Where's the bathroom? Down there, the left door. This kid is something... An asshole with a capital letter. And there's no way to talk him out of it. He's not interested in money. He's like a boy-scout but with big hairy nuts. It's a disgrace, Renzo. He said he'll report us as soon as he gets to Buenos Aires. Do you think he's capable of that? No doubt. This guy is the type of really earnest asshole. - Renzo. - Yes. What's that? This is poison. It finishes you out and leaves no trace. And how come you have that? Your nurse at the clinic gave it to me. Remember when you asked me to kill you? - And you would've...? - No, I wouldn't have used it anyway. Well, I think so. It's something else now. - Did you hear what he said? - What? That nobody knows he's here. Ah, yes. Do I put it in his coffee? Now I'm ready to go. Wait, kid... Have a coffee first. Arturo is preparing some. He makes it really good. Alright. A quick coffee, ok? So, tell me more about the project with the qom community. Now we're finishing the construction of a dining room. It's the third. We've received lots of contributions but the point is how to do the logistics, to make things reach those who need them. And the qom kids, what can I say, they're beautiful and healthy, who know nothing of technology because they don't have it. Their biggest commodity is getting some candies at the convenience store. For Children's Day we collected some toys, and I can't explain how beautiful it was. It was great to give them out to the kids and witness the smiles on their innocent faces, with those big black eyes. In the Netherlands now they're managing to get us a truck to move stuff. Here's your phone. Excuse me. - I didn't delete anything. - Ok, thank you. But check it, you'll see I didn't delete anything. - Arturo, I trust you. - Ok. - Here's your coffee. - Thanks. - Coffee. - Yes. A little bit more sugar. What is it? Nothing. I've been thinking. You're right. What we did is no good. It's a scam, Renzo. Yeah, what the hell. - What's wrong is wrong. - What's wrong is wrong. A young man, caring and idealist, giving a lesson to these two old men who committed a mistake. That's too much, but thanks. Things are what they are. When you get to Buenos Aires, do whatever you've got to do. I'm really sorry, I'm afraid I have no choice. Oh, well. The coffee's getting cold. - If I'm excused I have to go to the restroom. - Please. So is that it? How would I know? I think so. Anyway... let's wait. - So? - What do I know, shit! Wait! Let's see. Yes. That's it, that's it. - Come, come here. - No, I'm feeling bad. Take it easy. Maybe the height... We're above 3,000 meters... - Sorry about the show... - No. - Give me a rag, I'll clean it. - No, don't worry. - No, no, a rag? - No. Are you better? I don't know... You threw up all of a sudden. That fucking llama that he ate, probably. Bye. Let's go back to the beginning. I told you I was a murderer, and did not lie to you. As time went by, the poison had lost its lethal effect. It was overdue.. But I meant to kill an innocent man. And I carried it out.. But fate turned things the other way. My internal debate will be held only with my psychoanalyst. It's a secret I share with my friend Renzo and now with you. How did it all end? Such as we had suspected... - So, I asked that qom kid what was it... - As a righteous stupid boy-scout, Alex reported us for fraud. Questions? We were put on probation. It wasn't bad as it could've been. We are in the hands of Justice with Mr. Renzo Nervi. Renzo and I were all over the media. Dudu didn't know anything, so she escaped prosecution. Argentina is quite a particular country. And the art market is unpredictable. Many people took our fraud as a work of art. Renzo's prices and reputation' boomed even more than with his alleged death. Renzo is still living in Jujuy.. He paints from dawn till dusk. Of course, now, although he could, the still hates coming to the city.. Contrary to myself, kl am already missing Buenos Aires.. Hello! Happy birthday. Come, I brought you some presents. Grappa, olive oil, champagne, caviar. Look at this, this grappa, marvelous! This is too much. - Something's missing. - What? Come, let's go inside. Now, yes. Happy birthday. This is worth a million dollars. A little bit more. But you're turning eighty... What are you thinking about? Death. And what do you think about death? I'm against it. You know? A week ago... I had an audience with the Belgian Royal family. The king and the queen are really fans of your work. And they saw this landscape in a museum and they want you to paint one especially for them. I'm sorry. The painting is already done. It's one of the most important collections in the world. We put the price. No ceiling. You know I'm not a made-to-order painter. So you still think the same. Besides, I hate kings. Ok, we will talk about it later, more calmly. No, I'm already calm. The answer is no. We'll see. We'll see.
